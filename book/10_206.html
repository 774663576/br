<div class="line_en">You are familiar with Thorin's style on important occasions, so I will not give you any more of it, though he went on a good deal longer than this. It certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin Thrain's son Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer," he said crossly, "say so at once and have done! I might refuse. I have got you out of two messes already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so that I am, I think, already owed some reward. But 'third time pays for all' as my father used to say, and somehow I don't think I shall refuse. Perhaps I have begun to trust my luck more than I used to in the old days" -- he meant last spring before he left his own house, but it seemed centuries ago --"but anyway I think I will go and have a peep at once and get it over. Now who is coming with me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so he was not disappointed. Fili and Kili looked uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no pretence of offering-except old Balin, the lookout man, who was rather fond of the hobbit. He said he would come inside at least and perhaps a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他本来就不指望会有很多人异口同声地抢着要去，所以对于大家的冷漠反应并不感到有多失望。菲力和奇力看起来还有些不好意思，身体随着重心从一条腿换到另一条腿而轻微摇晃着，但其他人连装装样子都不愿意——惟一的例外是负责站岗的巴林，他对比尔博相当有好感。说他至少愿意和比尔博一起进门，或许还能陪着走上一小段距离，如果有必要的话，他可以出来求援。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are not, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don't expect too much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="矮人们的心态其实是这样的：他们准备为了比尔博的服务而付给他可观的报酬；他们让他为他们完成一桩特别危险的活儿，如果这个可怜的小家伙愿意干的话，他们并不介意让他去干；但如果他遇到了什么麻烦的话，他们会竭尽全力帮他脱离险境，就像他们在冒险刚开始的时候遇到食人妖那次出手相救那样，而当时他们还并没有什么特别的理由要对比尔博感恩图报。事实就是：矮人们并不是什么英雄，而是善于算计的、把钱看得很重的家伙。矮人一族中有些人是精明狡猾的奸恶之徒，而索林和他的伙伴们则不是，只要你对他们不要期望太高的话，他们也完全可以算得上是正派人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while Balin bade Bilbo "Good luck!" and stopped where he could still see the faint outline of the door, and by a trick of the echoes of the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering voices of the others just outside. Then the hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than hobbit's care to make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, down into the dark. He was trembling with fear, but his little face was set and grim. Already he was a very different hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End long ago. He had not had a pocket-handkerchief for ages. He loosened his dagger in its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿之后，巴林对比尔博说了句“祝好运！”就停住了脚步，这里还可以看见大门的依稀轮廓，而且凭借着洞穴的回音作用，还可以模模糊糊地听见门外其他矮人低声说话的声音。巴林走了之后，霍比特人戴上戒指，由于知道了洞穴会有回音效果，他加倍小心地不弄出任何声音，无声无息地一直向下、向下、向下，朝着无尽的黑暗走去。他害怕得浑身发抖，但小脸上的表情则是凝重而又坚毅的。此时的他和许久前刚上路时慌得忘记带手帕的那个霍比特人早已判若两人，而且他也已经很久没用过手帕了。他松开腰间的短剑，勒紧腰带，继续前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit crept through the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far easier going than he expected. This was no goblin entrance, or rough wood-elves' cave. It was a passage made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth and skill: straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle never-varying slope direct-to some distant end in the blackness below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当霍比特人慢慢进入施了魔法的密门，偷偷迈向大山的腹地时，在他身后，涂抹上了黑色的黯淡天空中已经开始出现了星辰。进山洞的过程远比他想像的要容易。这不是半兽人的洞穴，也不是森林精灵的简陋隧道，而是在矮人的财富和技艺都达到鼎盛的时期建造的通道：笔直得像把尺，地面和两边都很平整光滑，沿着一个平缓而又不变的坡度向前延伸——伸向下面的黑暗中某个遥远的尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was. As he went forward it grew and grew, till there was no doubt about it. It was a red light steadily getting redder and redder. Also it was now undoubtedly hot in the tunnel. Wisps of vapour floated up and past him and he began to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears, a sort of bubbling like the noise of a large pot galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of a gigantic tom-cat purring. This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确如此。随着他继续朝前走，光芒变得越来越强，直到最后变得确凿无疑为止。那是一种越来越红的光芒，而且隧道里面也不仅是温暖，而是肯定称得上热了。一缕一缕的蒸汽从他身边飘过，让他开始冒汗。一个声音也开始钻进他的耳中跃动，听起来像是架在火上的一口大锅里在沸腾冒泡，还夹杂着一种类似超级大猫发出的咕噜声。再听下去，这声音渐渐明确地变成了某种巨大的动物在睡觉时的鼾声，它就睡在前方下面那红色的闪光里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins," he said to himself. "You went and put your foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and am!" said the least Tookish part of him. "I have absolutely no use for dragon-guarded treasures, and the whole lot could stay here for ever, if only I could wake up and find this beastly tunnel was my own front-hall at home!"</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door behind had faded away. He was altogether alone. Soon he thought it was beginning to feel warm. "Is that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming right ahead down there?" he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他当然没有醒过来，还是继续往前走啊走，直到身后的石门连一点影子都看不到了。他现在完全是孤身一人了。很快他就开始觉得这里越来越暖了。“我在前面正下方隐约看见的难道是什么东西在发光吗？”他想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was at this point that Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterwards were as nothing compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit's little head. Before him lies the great bottom-most cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the Mountain's root. It is almost dark so that its vastness can only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is a great glow. The glow of Smaug!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博就在这个时候停了下来。继续走下去成了他这辈子做过的最勇敢的事情。之后发生的任何惊天动地的事情都无法与之相比。真正的战斗，是他孤身一人在隧道中，甚至还没见到等待着他的巨大危险的时候所发生的。不管怎样，他在经过一段短暂的停顿后又继续走了下去，你们可以想像他来到隧道尽头时的紧张心情。那里是一个和入口差不多大小的开口处，霍比特人把小脑袋伸了出去，在他眼前是古代矮人在山中所挖掘洞穴的最底部，以前这里要么是用作酒窖，要么是用作地牢。这里几乎是一片漆黑，比尔博只能粗略估计这里空间的宽阔，但是在岩石地面靠近他的这一端升起了一团炽热的红光——那正是恶龙史矛革所发出的光芒！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; a thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber. Beneath him, under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious things, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy light.</div>

<div class="line_en">He gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his sleep. He grasped a great two-handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his snoring changed its note.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他盯着财宝看了仿佛整整一个世纪，然后，他不由自主地从门口的阴影中偷偷走了出来，来到了最靠近他的宝山边沿。恶龙依旧沉睡着，但即便是睡着的恶龙也是一种巨大的威胁。他拿起了一个很大的双耳金杯，重得几乎是他所能负担的极限，同时满怀恐惧地朝上瞄了一眼。史矛革的翅膀动了一下，张开了一只爪子，鼾声的音调也跟着改变了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To say that Bilbo's breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the world was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, almost forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说比尔博看见宝物忘记了呼吸，真不算是过分的形容。人类的语言相对贫乏，所以没有什么词可以用來形容比尔当时目眩神迷的心灵震撼。人类的语言本来就是从精灵那里学来的，而精灵的语言跟他们当时所处的世界一样，是绚丽多彩的，人类学来后作了改变，因此表达就越来越贫乏了。比尔博以前听人们或说或唱过关于恶龙的财宝，却从未面对面领略过财富如此辉煌的景象、如此强烈的欲望和如此璀燦的荣耀。他怔怔地望着这些价值无法估量的金银财宝，几乎完全忘记了那恐怖的守卫，心中满是迷乱，并深深感受到了矮人们所怀的渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smaug lay, with wings folded like an immeasurable bat, turned partly on one side, so that the hobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly crusted with gems and fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed. Behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail, helms and axes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled with a wealth that could not be guessed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史矛革的双翼收拢着，像是一只极其巨大的蝙蝠一样躺在地上，身体微微偏向一侧，因此霍比特人得以看见它那颀长而又苍白的肚子，因为长时间躺在价值连城的珍宝之床上，它的肚子上粘了许多宝石和金块。在史矛革身后的墙壁上，依稀可以看见挂着盔甲、头盔、斧头、剑和长矛等东西。墙边还立着一排排的大瓮，里面满装着的宝物价值难以估量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not wake-not yet-but shifted into other dreams of greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall while the little hobbit toiled back up the long tunnel. His heart was beating and a more fevered shaking was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he clutched the cup, and his chief thought was: "I've done it! This will show them. 'More like a grocer than a burglar' indeed! Well, we'll hear no more of that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博朝外逃去，但恶龙并没有醒来——还不到醒的时候——它依旧躺在这个从矮人们手里偷来的大厅里，只是转换到了另一个充满贪婪和暴力的梦境而已。霍比特人则紧张万分地沿着狭长的隧道往回跑着。他的心扑通扑通直跳，双腿比刚才下来的时候更加激动地颤抖着，但他依旧紧紧抓着金杯不放，脑子里只有一个念头：“我做到了！这个金杯就是证明。说我不像飞贼，倒更像杂货店老板，哼！看以后谁还敢说出这种话来！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the back and put themselves and all their families for generations to come at his service.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的确再也没有听到这种说法了。巴林看到霍比特人安全地回来，不禁欣喜若狂，同时也感到非常惊讶。他一把抱起比尔博来到外面的空地上。这时还是半夜，云朵遮住了星星，可比尔博闭着眼躺在地上，大口地喘着气，感受着新鲜空气带来的快感。他几乎没有注意到矮人们的兴奋反应，或是他们如何称赞自己，拍打他的肩膀，还答应不仅矮人们自己，而且还有他们全家、全族的好几代都愿意为他效劳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once again. The door behind them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them tremble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="矮人们还在轮流传看着金杯，兴高采烈地讨论着重新找到了他们的财宝，突然间山中深处传来了一阵巨大的隆隆声，仿佛有哪座古老的火山决定要再度喷发一般。他们身后的密门几乎要全关上了，矮人们用一块石头卡在那里不让它关上。但是，从长长的隧道里传来了可怕的回声，回声来自遥远的地底，是低吼和粗重的脚步声，令他们脚下的大地也为之震动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment before and cowered down in fright. Smaug was still to be reckoned with. It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him. Dragons may not have much real use for all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. He had passed from an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword and great courage, figured most unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking. There was a breath of strange air in his cave. Could there be a draught from that little hole? He had never felt quite happy about it, though it was so small, and now he glared at it in suspicion and wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that came down through it to his lair. He stirred and stretched forth his neck to sniff. Then he missed the cup!</div>

His rage passes description-the sort of rage that is only seen when rich folk that have more than they can enjoy suddenly lose something that they have long had but have never before used or wanted. His fire belched forth, the hall smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. He thrust his head in vain at the little hole, and then coiling his length together, roaring like thunder underground, he sped from his deep lair through its great door, out into the huge passages of the mountain-palace and up towards the Front Gate.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had barely time to fly back to the tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, when Smaug came hurtling from the North, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great wings with a noise like a roaring wind. His hot breath shrivelled the grass before the door, and drove in through the crack they had left and scorched them as they lay hid. Flickering fires leaped up and black rock-shadows danced. Then darkness fell as he passed again. The ponies screamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. The dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone.</div>

Long he had hunted in vain till the dawn chilled his wrath and he went back to his golden couch to sleep-and to gather new strength.

But what about delivery? What about cartage? What about armed guards and tolls?" And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he knew his guesses were not far out, though he suspected that the Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and that most of the plunder was meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young days had been called Esgaroth.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo. All through their talk he was only half listening to them. He sat nearest to the door with one ear cocked for any beginnings of a sound without, his other was alert for echoes beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any whisper of a movement from far below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，那种对宝物着了魔似的渴望在比尔博身上已经降温了。矮人们在谈论的时候，他只是半心半意地听着。他坐在离门最近的地方，竖起一只耳朵来专心倾听门外的任何异响，而另一只耳朵则是用来监听门内除了矮人们低语之外的声响，任何由下面的动静造成的轻微回声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. No trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the Mountain!</div>

<div class="line_en">And not a moment too soon. They had hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when a blow smote the side of the Mountain like the crash of battering-rams made of forest oaks and swung by giants. The rock boomed, the walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on their heads. What would have happened if the door had still been open I don't like to think. They fled further down the tunnel glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble of Smaug's fury. He was breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their little lofty camping ground, the scorched grass, the thrush's stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered stones fell over the cliff into the valley below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真是千钧一发啊。他们刚刚迈步朝着隧道下面没走出多远，就只听见山的这一边发出一声轰天巨响，仿佛被巨人用橡木做的攻城大锤用力击中了一般。岩石轰隆隆地震动着，岩壁裂开了缝隙，碎右从洞顶落下。我真不敢想像如果门没有关上的话会是什么样子。他们庆幸自己逃过一劫，朝着隧道深处狂奔，身后的门外传来史矛革愤怒的吼声。他将岩石击碎成粉末，用他那巨大的尾巴甩打着岩壁与悬崖，直到他们建在高处的小小营地、洞门前被烤焦的青草、画眉鸟栖身的巨石、爬满蜗牛的岩壁、狭窄的山脊，统统在恶龙的愤怒下化成碎屑，巨大的山崩也跟着掩埋了底下的山谷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smaug had left his lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and then floated heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind towards the west of the Mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares something or somebody there, and of spying the outlet to the passage which the thief had used. This was the outburst of his wrath when he could find nobody and see nothing, even where he guessed the outlet must actually be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史矛革之前轻轻地离开了洞穴，悄悄飞上天空，然后像一只巨大的乌鸦一般沉重而又缓慢地盘旋在夜空中，乘着风滑翔向大山的西边，希望能够出其不意地抓到某些东西或某些人，同时探看一下小偷们用的那条隧道的出口在哪里。刚才的地动山摇，就是因为当他来到了他认准的出口，却什么人和东西都没发现，一怒之下采取的发泄之举。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After he had let off his rage in this way he felt better and he thought in his heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In the meanwhile he had further vengeance to take. "Barrel-rider!" he snorted. "Your feet came from the waterside and up the water you came without a doubt. I don't know your smell, but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help. They shall see me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在以这种方式发泄了心中的怒气之后，史矛革感觉好多了，他发自内心地认为自己不会再从那个方向受到骚扰了。转过神来，他就觉得自己还有别的复仇计划要进行。“木桶骑士！”他鼻子里哼了一声说道，“你们的双脚原本是在水边的，你们毫无疑问是沿水路上来的。我虽然不知道你的气味，但就算你不是湖边人类的一份子，肯定也得到过他们的帮助。他们应该见见我了，我要让他们记起来谁才是真正的山下之王！”">查看中文翻译</div>
