<div class="line_en">The next morning he looked over the papers and waded through a long list of advertisements, making a few notes. Then he turned to the male-help-wanted column, but with disagreeable feelings. The day was before him -- a long day in which to discover something -- and this was how he must begin to discover. He scanned the long column, which mostly concerned bakers, bushelmen, cooks, compositors, drivers, and the like, finding two things only which arrested his eye. One was a cashier wanted in a wholesale furniture house, and the other a salesman for a whiskey house. He had never thought of the latter. At once he decided to look that up.</div>

<div class="line_en">He nodded good-morning and came away. At the corner he looked at the furniture company's address, and saw that it was in West Twenty-third Street. Accordingly, he went up there. The place was not large enough, however. It looked moderate, the men in it idle and small salaried. He walked by, glancing in, and then decided not to go in there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点头告别后，走了出来。在拐角处，他看看那家家具行的地址，弄清楚是在西二十三街。他照着这个地址去了那里。可是这家店并不太大，看上去是家中等店铺，里面的人都闲着而且薪水很少。他走过时朝里面扫了一眼，随后就决定不进去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At one o'clock he thought of eating, and went to a restaurant in Madison Square. There he pondered over places which he might look up. He was tired. It was blowing up grey again. Across the way, through Madison Square Park, stood the great hotels, looking down upon a busy scene. He decided to go over to the lobby of one and sit a while. It was warm in there and bright. He had seen no one he knew at the Broadway Central. In all likelihood he would encounter no one here. Finding a seat on one of the red plush divans close to the great windows which look out on Broadway's busy rout, he sat musing. His state did not seem so bad in here. Sitting still and looking out, he could take some slight consolation in the few hundred dollars he had in his purse. He could forget, in a measure, the weariness of the street and his tiresome searches. Still, it was only escape from a severe to a less severe state. He was still gloomy and disheartened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1点钟时，他想吃饭了，便走进麦迪逊广场的一家餐馆。在那里，他考虑着可以去找事做的地方。他累了。又刮起了寒风。在对面，穿过麦迪逊广场公园，耸立着那些大旅馆，俯瞰着热闹的街景。他决定过到那边去，在一家旅馆的门厅里坐一会儿。那里面又暖和又亮堂。他在百老汇中央旅馆没有遇见熟人。十有八九，在这里也不会遇见熟人的。他在大窗户旁边的一只红丝绒长沙发上坐了下来，窗外看得见百老汇大街的喧闹景象，他坐在那里想着心事。在这里，他觉得自己的处境似乎还不算太糟。静静地坐在那里看着窗外，他可以从他的钱包里那几百块钱中找到一点安慰。他可以忘掉一些街上奔波的疲乏和四处找寻的劳累。可是，这只不过是从一个严峻的处境逃到一个不太严峻的处境罢了。他仍旧愁眉不展，灰心丧气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The clock outside registered four. It was a little early, but he thought he would go back to the flat.</div>

<div class="line_en">There, minutes seemed to go very slowly. An hour was a long, long time in passing. It was filled for him with observations and mental comments concerning the actual guests of the hotel, who passed in and out, and those more prosperous pedestrians whose good fortune showed in their clothes and spirits as they passed along Broadway, outside. It was nearly the first time since he had arrived in the city that his leisure afforded him ample opportunity to contemplate this spectacle. Now, being, perforce, idle himself, he wondered at the activity of others. How gay were the youths he saw, how pretty the women. Such fine clothes they all wore. They were so intent upon getting somewhere. He saw coquettish glances cast by magnificent girls. Ah, the money it required to train with such -- how well he knew! How long it had been since he had had the opportunity to do so!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这里，一分钟一分钟似乎过得特别慢。一个钟头过去需要很长很长的时间。在这一个钟头里，他忙着观察和评价那些进进出出的这家旅馆的真正旅客，以及旅馆外面百老汇大街上来往的那些更加有钱的行人，这些人都是财运当头，这从他们的衣着和神情上就看得出来。自他到纽约以来，这差不多是他第一次有这么多的空闲来欣赏这样的场面。现在他自己被迫闲了下来，都不知道别人在忙乎些什么了。他看到的这些青年多么快乐，这些女人多么漂亮埃他们的衣着全都是那么华丽。他们都那么急着要赶到什么地方去。他看见美丽动人的姑娘抛出卖弄风情的眼色。啊，和这些人交往得要多少金钱——他太清楚了！他已经很久没有机会这样生活了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This going back to the flat was coupled with the thought that Carrie would think he was sitting around too much if he came home early. He hoped he wouldn't have to, but the day hung heavily on his hands. Over there he was on his own ground. He could sit in his rocking-chair and read. This busy, distracting, suggestive scene was shut out. He could read his papers. Accordingly, he went home. Carrie was reading, quite alone. It was rather dark in the flat, shut in as it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一想到回公寓，他又连带想到，要是他回家早了，嘉莉会认为他在家闲坐的时间太多了。他希望自己不用早回去，可是这一天实在是太难熬了。回到家里他就自在了。他可以坐在摇椅里看报纸。这种忙碌、分心、使人引起联想的场面就被挡在了外面。他可以看看报纸。这样一想，他就回家了。嘉莉在看书，很是孤单。房子周围被遮住了，里面很暗。">查看中文翻译</div>
