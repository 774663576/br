<div class="line_en">There once lived a man and his wife, who had long wished for a child, but in vain. Now there was at the back of their house a little window which overlooked a beautiful garden full of the finest vegetables and flowers; but there was a high wall all round it, and no one ventured into it, for it belonged to a witch of great might, and of whom all the world was afraid. One day, when the wife was standing at the window, and looking into the garden, she saw a bed filled with the finest rampion; and it looked so fresh and green that she began to wish for some; and at length she longed for it greatly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前有一对夫妻。 他们很久就希望有个孩子，但是总不能如愿。 他们的后屋有一扇小窗，从这小窗子看到下面有一个长满了奇花异草的漂亮的花园，但是周围有高墙，没有人敢冒险进入这个花园，因为这所花园属于一个法力无边的巫婆，整个世界也都怕她。 有一天，那个妻子正站在窗前，欣赏着下面花园的景色时，突然发现花园中有一个长满了漂亮的风铃草的花床。 那些风铃草长得如此鲜嫩，如此碧绿诱人，使她开始想要得到一些，而且最后她强烈地渴望要得到它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So in the twilight he climbed over the wall into the witch's garden, plucked hastily a handful of rampion and brought it to his wife. She made a salad of it at once, and ate of it to her heart's content. But she liked it so much, and it tasted so good, that the next day she longed for it thrice as much as she had done before; if she was to have any rest the man must climb over the wall once more. So he went in the twilight again; and as he was climbing back, he saw, all at once, the witch standing before him, and was terribly frightened, as she cried, with angry eyes:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，在昏暗的傍晚时分，他翻墙爬进了巫婆的花园，匆匆忙忙地摘了一把风铃草，带给他的妻子。 她把那风铃草做成沙拉，心满意足地把它吃了。 由于风铃草味道鲜美之极，第二天她比以前更想要吃。 如果要使她满意，她丈夫必须每次翻墙入园采摘风铃草。 于是，在傍晚时分，他又去了。 当他要爬出围墙时，他突然发现那巫婆正站在他面前，当她带着愤怒的目光对他吼叫时，他害怕极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the witch said:"If what you tell me is true, you may have as much rampion as you like, on one condition-the child thatwill come into the world must be given to me. I will be kind to the child, and care for it like a mother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，那巫婆就说：“如果你说的是真话，那么你要多少就可摘多少。 但是有一个条件，你妻子吃了这风铃草之后，生下的孩子一定要给我，我会像母亲一样慈祥地照看那孩子。 ”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In his distress of mind the man promised everything; and when the time came when the child was born, the witch appeared and, giving the child the name of Rapunzel (which is the same as rampion), she took it away with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rapunzel was the most beautiful child in the world. When she was twelve years old the witch shut her up in a tower in the midst of a wood, and it had neither steps nor door, only a small window above.

<div class="line_en">After they had lived thus a few years it happened that as the King's son was riding through the wood, he came to the tower; and as he drew near he heard a voice singing so sweetly that he stood still and listened. It was Rapunzel in her loneliness trying to pass away the time with sweet songs. The King's son wished to go in to her, and sought to find a door in the tower, but there was none. So he rode home, but the song had entered into his heart, and every day he went into the wood and listened to it. Once, as he was standing there under a tree, he saw the witch come up, and listened while she called out:</div>

Then Rapunzel forgot her terror, and when he asked her to take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and beautiful, she thought to herself:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到爬进塔中的是个男子，拉庞翠儿大吃一惊，因为她从来没有看见过男子，但是王子开始很和善地向她倾诉他对于她的歌声是如何地难以忘怀，因此他觉得一定要和她见面，否则心情就不得安宁。 这时拉庞翠儿忘了恐惧。 她也看到王子既年轻，又英俊，当王子向她求婚时，她暗自思量：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would willingly go with you, but I do not know how I shall get out. When you come, bring each time a silken rope, and I will make a ladder, and when it is quite ready I will get down by it out of the tower, and you shall take me away on your horse."They agreed that be should come to her every evening, as the old woman came in the daytime.
