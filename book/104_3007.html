<div class="line_en">At first, Lo had refused "to try what it was like," but curiosity and camaraderie prevailed, and soon she and Barbara were doing it by turns with the silent, coarse and surly but indefatigable Charlie, who had as much sex appeal as a raw carrot but sported a fascinating collection of contraceptives which he used to fish out of a third nearby lake, a considerably larger and more populous one, called Lake Climax, after the booming young factory town of that name. Although conceding it was "sort of fun" and "fine for the complexion," Lolita, I am glad to say, held Charlie's mind and manners in the greatest contempt. Nor had her temperament been roused by that filthy fiend. In fact, I think he had rather stunned it, despite the "fun."</div>

<div class="line_en">Barbara Burke, a sturdy blond, two years older than Lo and by far the camp's best swimmer, had a very special canoe which she shared with Lo "because I was the only other girl who could make Willow Island" (some swimming test, I imagine). Through July, every morning -- mark, reader, every blessed morning -- Barbara and Lo would be helped to carry the boat to Onyx or Eryx (two small lakes in the wood) by Charlie Holmes, the camp mistress' son, aged thirteen -- and the only human male for a couple of miles around (excepting an old meek stone-deaf handyman, and a farmer in an old Ford who sometimes sold the campers eggs as farmers will); every morning, oh my reader, the three children would take a short cut through the beautiful innocent forest brimming with all the emblems of youth, dew, birdsongs, and at one point, among the luxuriant undergrowth, Lo would be left as sentinel, while Barbara and the boy copulated behind a bush.</div>

<div class="line_en">By that time it was close to ten. With the ebb of lust, an ashen sense of awfulness, abetted by the realistic drabness of a gray neuralgic day, crept over me and hummed within my temples. Brown, naked, frail Lo, her narrow white buttocks to me, her sulky face to a door mirror, stood, arms akimbo, feet (in new slippers with pussy-fur tops) wide apart, and through a forehanging lock tritely mugged at herself in the glass. From the corridor came the cooing voices of colored maids at work, and presently there was a mild attempt to open the door of our room. I had Lo go to the bathroom and take a much-needed soap shower. The bed was a frightful mess with overtones of potato chips. She tried on a two-piece navy wool, then a sleeveless blouse with a swirly clathrate skirt, but the first was too tight and the second too ample, and when I begged her to hurry up (the situation was beginning to frighten me), Lo viciously sent those nice presents of mine hurtling into a corner, and put on yesterday's dress. When she was ready at last, I gave her a lovely new purse of simulated calf (in which I had slipped quite a few pennies and two mint-bright dimes) and told her to buy herself a magazine in the lobby.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything was fine. There, in the lobby, she sat, deep in an overstuffed blood-red armchair, deep in a lurid movie magazine. A fellow of my age in tweeds (the genre of the place had changed overnight to a spurious country-squire atmosphere) was staring at my Lolita over his dead cigar and stale newspaper. She wore her professional white socks and saddle oxfords, and that bright print frock with the square throat; a splash of jaded lamplight brought out the golden down on her warm brown limbs. There she sat, her legs carelessly highcrossed, and her pale eyes skimming along the lines with every now and then a blink. Bill's wife had worshiped him from afar long before they ever met: in fact, she used to secretly admire the famous young actor as he ate sundaes in Schwab's drugstore. Nothing could have been more childish than her snubbed nose, freckled face or the purplish spot on her naked neck where a fairytale vampire had feasted, or the unconscious movement of her tongue exploring a touch of rosy rash around her swollen lips; nothing could be more harmless than to read about Jill, an energetic starlet who made her own clothes and was a student of serious literature; nothing could be more innocent than the part in that glossy brown hair with that silky sheen on the temple; nothing could be more naive -- But what sickening envy the lecherous fellow whoever he was -- come to think of it, he resembled a little my Swiss uncle Gustave, also a great admirer of le découvert -- would have experienced had he known that every nerve in me was still anointed and ringed with the feel of her body -- the body of some immortal daemon disguised as a female child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都好极了。她，坐在休息厅的一张堆满软垫的血红色扶手椅里，沉浸在一本恐怖的电影画报中。一位年龄和我相仿、穿苏格兰粗呢衣服的人（那地方的风格一夜之间变得很有假乡绅气了）正越过他熄灭了的香烟和旧报纸盯着我的洛丽塔看。她穿着白袜和运动鞋，和那身耀眼的方领粉色长裙；—抹疲惫灯光的溅落，显出金黄色在她温热褐色的四肢上。她坐在那儿，两条腿不经意地高高交叉着，她被遮暗的眉眼在宇行间扫描着，不时眨动一下。比尔的妻子在他们初逢以前就从远方为他祈祷过：她实际上曾暗自崇拜过那位年轻的男演员，那时他却正在施沃布杂货店吃圣代。没有什么能比她翘俏的狮子鼻、满脸雀斑或赤裸的脖颈上的紫点更孩子气的了，那是神话里的吸血鬼在她玉颈上饱饮一顿的结果，也没有什么比她的舌头不经意在她肿胀的唇上舔出一点点玫瑰色斑瘀更可爱的了；没有什么比读有关吉尔的文章更无害的了，她是个充满活力的女明星，自己做衣服，还是专修严肃文学的学生；没有什么比柔腻滑洁的躯干上那一丛光润的褐色毛发中的那个部分更天真无邪的了；没有什么更单纯的了—但是，假使那淫恶的人，不管他是谁—想想看，他酷似我的瑞士叔叔古斯塔夫，也是一位透支金额的大崇拜者—知道我的每一根神经仍然涂抹着对她身体的热情而颤响，他会体验到一种多么令人作呕的嫉妒—那身体是一个必夺人魂魄的恶魔乔装成雌性的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then I finished dressing and had the hoary bellboy come up for the bags.</div>

<div class="line_en">She read to the car. Still reading, she was driven to a so-called coffee shop a few blocks south. Oh, she ate all right. She even laid aside her magazine to eat, but a queer dullness had replaced her usual cheerfulness. I knew little Lo could be very nasty, so I braced myself and grinned, and waited for a squall. I was unbathed, unshaven, and had had no bowel movement. My nerves were a-jangle. I did not like the way my little mistress shrugged her shoulders and distended her nostrils when I attempted casual small talk. Had Phyllis been in the know before she joined her parents in Maine? I asked with a smile. "Look," said Lo making a weeping grimace, "let us get off the subject." I then tried -- also unsuccessfully, no matter how I smacked my lips -- to interest her in the road map. Our destination was, let me remind my patient reader whose meek temper Lo ought to have copied, the gay town of Lepingville, somewhere near a hypothetical hospital. That destination was in itself a perfectly arbitrary one (as, alas, so many were to be), and I shook in my shoes as I wondered how to keep the whole arrangement plausible, and what other plausible objectives to invent after we had taken in all the movies in Lepingville. More and more uncomfortable did Humbert feel. It was something quite special, that feeling: an oppressive, hideous constraint as if I were sitting with the small ghost of somebody I had just killed.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she was in the act of getting back into the car, an expression of pain flitted across Lo's face. It flitted again, more meaningfully, as she settled down beside me. No doubt, she reproduced it that second time for my benefit. Foolishly, I asked her what was the matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cold spiders of panic crawled down my back. This was an orphan. This was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a heavy-limbed, foul-smelling adult had had strenuous intercourse three times that very morning. Whether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had surpassed all expectation, it had, in a sense, overshot its mark -- and plunged into a nightmare. I had been careless, stupid, and ignoble. And let me be quite frank: somewhere at the bottom of that dark turmoil I felt the writhing of desire again, so monstrous was my appetite for that miserable nymphet. Mingled with the pangs of guilt was the agonizing thought that her mood might prevent me from making love to her again as soon as I found a nice country road where to park in peace. In other words, poor Humbert Humbert was dreadfully unhappy, and while steadily and inanely driving toward Lepingville, he kept racking his brains for some quip, under the bright wing of which he might dare turn to his seat-mate. It was she, however, who broke the silence:</div>

Presently, making a sizzling sound with her lips, she started complaining of pains, said she could not sit, said I had torn something inside her.
