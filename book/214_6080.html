<div class="line_en">"Quarters!" he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our places, "Gray," he said, "I'll put your name in the log; you've stood by your duty like a seaman.

<div class="line_en">On the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two loopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the north side, five. There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us; the firewood had been built into four piles-tables, you might say -- one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders. In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sane was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and anxiety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如船长所说，寒气过去了。太阳刚一爬到我们外围的树梢上，就将它的热力倾向了地面，把个雾气吸得干干净净。沙子很快便开始发烫，木屋房架上木头里的树脂也被烤化了。外套和上衣已被扔到了一边，衬衫领口也敞开着，翻到了肩上；我们每个人都站在各自的岗位上，天气炎热加上内心焦灼，弄得浑身燥热。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Doctor, you will take the door," he resumed. "See, and don't expose yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east side, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you are the best shot -- you and Gray will take this long north side, with the five loopholes; it's there the danger is. If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty. Hawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we'll stand by to load and bear a hand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“医生，你把住门，”他说，“注意，不要暴露自己；待在里面，从门廊往外射击。亨特，负责东面。乔埃斯，你站在西面，老弟。特里罗尼先生，你是最好的射手──你和葛雷得负责最长的北面，有五个射击孔；这里最危险。要是他们上到这面来，从我们自己的射击孔里向我们开火，情况就不妙了。霍金斯，你和我枪法都不怎么样，我们就站在一边装弹药，打个下手。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket -- barrel betrayed the presence of our foes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样又过了几秒钟，直到乔埃斯猛地举枪开了火。枪声余音未落，回敬的枪声便接踵而至，从寨子的四面八方飞来，像接连不断的雁群似的，一枪紧挨一枪。有几发子弹打中了木屋子，但是没有穿透进来。当硝烟散去之后，寨子和环绕它的树林又恢复了先前的寂静和空落。没有一根树枝摇动，也没见到一个暴露我们敌人踪迹的枪管在闪光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you please, sir," said Joyce, "if I see anyone, am I to fire?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Next best thing to tell the truth," muttered Captain Smollett. "Load his gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“讲实话也算不错，”斯莫列特船长咕哝道。“给他的枪装上弹药，霍金斯。你那边打了几枪，医生？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know precisely," said Dr. Livesey. "Three shots were fired on this side. I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这我知道得很清楚，”利弗西医生说道，“这边是三枪。我看到三次闪光──两次挨得近──另外一次离得远，靠西边。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，先生，”乔埃斯答道，“我想是没有，先生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可不太容易回答了。从北面射来了许多枪──据乡绅计算是七枪，而据葛雷估计则是八枪到九枪。从东面和西面射来的总共只有一枪。因此，进攻显然是从北面展开，而在其余的三面，我们将只受到些虚张声势的骚扰。但是，斯莫列特船长并没有改变部署。他提出，如果反叛分子成功地越过了栅栏的话，他们就会占领任何一个无人把守的射击孔，就会把我们像打耗子一样地打死在我们自己的堡垒里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor's musket into bits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们也没有时间多想了。突然，随着一声呐喊，一小撮海盗窜出了北面的树林，直奔寨子跑来。与此同时，树林里又一次开了火，一颗子弹呼啸着从门外飞来，立刻便把医生的枪击成了碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Three!" repeated the captain. "And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="两个当场毙命，一个跑掉了，四个已经漂亮地进到了我们的栅栏里面；而在树林的隐蔽下，还有七八个人，每个人显然都配备了好几支枪，不断地向木屋进行猛烈的、然而是无效的射击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure, two back on the outside.

<div class="line_cn" title="海盗们像猿猴般地翻越了栅栏。乡绅和葛雷一次又一次地射击，三个倒下了，一个向前倒在寨子里面，两个朝后倒在了外面。但这两个中，有一个显然是受了惊吓而非挂彩，因为他又一骨碌爬起来，立刻便消失在了树林里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory. Hunter lay beside his loophole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot through the head, never to move again; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain, one as pale as the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，屋内的硝烟已经稍稍消散，我们一眼便可看出为胜利所付出的代价来。亨特倒在了他的射击孔旁，昏迷不醒。乔埃斯紧挨着他，被射穿了脑袋，一动不动。而就在屋子正中，乡绅正扶着船长，两人都面色苍白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have they run?" asked Mr. Smollett.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们跑掉了吗？”斯莫列特先生问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All that could, you may be bound," returned the doctor; "but there's five of them will never run again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都想跑，你可以相信，”医生回答道，“但是有五个永远也跑不了了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Five!" cried the captain. "Come, that's better. Five against three leaves us four to nine. That's better odds than we had at starting. We were seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that's as bad to bear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“五个！”船长叫道，“看，这满不错。五个对三个，剩下我们四个对他们九个。这个差距比刚开头的时候小得多了。那时是我们七个对他们十九个，想想那时的处境，真是让人受不了啊。”①【注：①叛乱分子很快就只剩下八个了，因为那个在船上被特里罗尼先生打中的人当晚就死了。但是这一点，这忠实正派的一伙当然是后来才知道的。】">查看中文翻译</div>
