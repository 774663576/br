<div class="line_en">I started kindergarten at Bryn Mawr Elementary School in the fall of 1969, showing up with the twin advantages of knowing in advance how to read basic words and having a well-liked second-grade brother ahead of me. The school, a four-story brick building with a yard in front, sat just a couple of blocks from our house on Euclid. Getting there involved a two-minute walk or, if you did it like Craig, a one-minute run.</div>

<div class="line_en">I liked school right away. I liked my teacher, a diminutive white lady named Mrs. Burroughs, who seemed ancient to me but was probably in her fifties. Her classroom had big sunny windows, a collection of baby dolls to play with, and a giant cardboard playhouse in the back. I made friends in my class, drawn to the kids who, like me, seemed eager to be there. I was confident in my ability to read. At home, I'd plowed through the Dick and Jane books, courtesy of my mom's library card, and thus was thrilled to hear that our first job as kindergartners would be learning to read new sets of words by sight. We were assigned a list of colors to study, not the hues, but the words themselves --"red," "blue," "green," "black," "orange," "purple," "white." In class, Mrs. Burroughs quizzed us one student at a time, holding up a series of large manila cards and asking us to read whatever word was printed in black letters on the front. I watched one day as the girls and boys I was just getting to know stood up and worked through the color cards, succeeding and failing in varying degrees, and were told to sit back down at whatever point they got stumped. It was meant to be something of a game, I think, the way a spelling bee is a game, but you could see a subtle sorting going on and a knowing slump of humiliation in the kids who didn't make it past "red." This, of course, was 1969, in a public school on the South Side of Chicago. Nobody was talking about self-esteem or growth mind-sets. If you'd had a head start at home, you were rewarded for it at school, deemed "bright" or "gifted," which in turn only compounded your confidence. The advantages aggregated quickly. The two smartest kids in my kindergarten class were Teddy, a Korean American boy, and Chiaka, an African American girl, who both would remain at the top of the class for years to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立刻就爱上了学校。我喜欢我的老师，她是一位矮小的白人女士，名叫巴罗斯太太。当时我觉得她很老，不过她可能也就是五十几岁。教室里有大大的向阳的窗户，有许多布娃娃可以玩，教室后面还有一个巨大的纸板玩具屋。我在班里交了一些朋友，都是些和我一样喜欢上学的孩子。我对自己的阅读能力很自信。我在家已经磕磕巴巴地读完了“迪克和简”系列 [1]，书是用母亲的借书证借的，所以当听到我们上幼儿园第一件事是认读一组新单词时，我兴奋不已。我们要学习一组颜色词，不是认颜色，只是学单词—“red”“blue”“green”“black”“orange”“purple”“white” [2]。上课时，巴罗斯太太挨个儿考我们。她举起一组马尼拉纸制成的拼读卡片，让我们读出印在上面的黑色字母组成的单词。我看着那些我刚刚认识的男孩女孩站起来认读颜色卡片，表现有好有坏，程度不一。他们念不上来的时候，就被要求坐下。我觉得这本应是一个游戏，类似于英语拼写大赛的游戏，但你能看到一场微妙的分级正在发生，那些连第一个单词“red”都读不上来的孩子明显羞愧难当。当然，这是1969年芝加哥南城的一所公立学校，当时还没有自尊教育或者成长型思维的提法。如果你在家提早预习了功课，在学校就能得到奖赏，被认为是“聪明的”或“有天赋的”，这反过来又提振了你的自信心。这种先发优势累积得很快。我的班上两个最聪明的孩子分别是泰迪和齐娅卡，泰迪是一个韩裔美国男孩，齐娅卡是一个非洲裔美国女孩，之后很多年他们在班里一直都名列前茅。【注：[1]“迪克和简”系列（Dick and Jane books），美国20世纪30年代到90年代都很受欢迎的一套教儿童认字的基础读物。“迪克”和“简”是书里两个主要人物的名字。[2]这组英文颜色词依次为“红色”“蓝色”“绿色”“黑色”“橙色”“紫色”和“白色”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was driven to keep up with them. When it came my turn to read the words off the teacher's manila cards, I stood up and gave it everything I had, rattling off "red," "green," and "blue" without effort. "Purple" took a second, though, and "orange" was hard. But it wasn't until the letters W-H-I-T-E came up that I froze altogether, my throat instantly dry, my mouth awkward and unable to shape the sound as my brain glitched madly, trying to dig up a color that resembled "wuh-haaa." It was a straight-up choke. I felt a weird airiness in my knees, as if they might buckle. But before they did, Mrs. Burroughs instructed me to sit back down. And that's exactly when the word hit me in its full and easy perfection. White. Whiiiite. The word was "white."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立志要赶上他们。当轮到我念老师手里的拼读卡片时，我站起身，不假思索地念出了“red”“green”和“blue”。我在“purple”上卡了一下，“orange”就比较难了，但是到了“W-H—I-T—E”这个字母组合出现时，我脑袋一下子蒙了。我的嗓子瞬间变干，嘴巴也不听使唤，怎么都念不出来，脑子疯狂地搜寻着那个音似“wuh-haaa”的颜色词。这就是所谓语塞吧。我感觉膝盖无力，两腿发软。这时巴罗斯太太让我坐下。而就在坐下的一瞬间，一个单词清晰地出现在我的脑子里：white。哦，那个单词是“white”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lying in bed that night with my stuffed animals packed around my head, I thought only of "white." I spelled it in my head, forward and backward, chastising myself for my own stupidity. The embarrassment felt like a weight, like something I'd never shake off, even though I knew my parents wouldn't care whether I'd read every card correctly. I just wanted to achieve. Or maybe I didn't want to be dismissed as incapable of achieving. I was sure my teacher had now pegged me as someone who couldn't read or, worse, didn't try. I obsessed over the dime-sized gold-foil stars that Mrs. Burroughs had given to Teddy and Chiaka that day to wear on their chests as an emblem of their accomplishment, or maybe a sign that they were marked for greatness when the rest of us weren't. The two of them, after all, had read every last color card without a hitch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我躺在床上，脑袋周围放着毛绒玩具，满脑子想的都是“white”。我在脑子里拼着这个单词，正着拼，又倒着拼，骂自己“蠢”。这件丢脸的事情在我心里像有千斤重，好像永远摆脱不了似的，尽管我知道父母不会在意我是否正确念出了每一张卡片。我只是想要做好，或者说我不愿意让人觉得我做不好。我确信老师现在把我看作一个认读不行的学生，或者更糟，认为我根本不上进。我还念念不忘那个十美分硬币大小的金箔纸做的小星星，那是巴罗斯太太给泰迪和齐娅卡的奖品，让他们戴在胸前，奖励他们准确无误地念出了所有的颜色单词。这个奖品是他们优异表现的象征，或者说是一个表明他们优于我们这些人的符号。">查看中文翻译</div>

And it worked, through "black," "orange," "purple," and especially "white." I was practically shouting the word "white" before I'd even seen the letters on the card. I like to imagine now that Mrs. Burroughs was impressed with this little black girl who'd found the courage to advocate for herself. I didn't know whether Teddy and Chiaka had even noticed. I was quick to claim my trophy, though, heading home that afternoon with my head up and one of those gold-foil stars stuck on my shirt.</div>

<div class="line_en">At home, I lived in a world of high drama and intrigue, immersing myself in an ever-evolving soap opera of dolls. There were births, feuds, and betrayals. There was hope, hatred, and sometimes sex. My preferred way to pass the time between school and dinner was to park myself in the common area outside my room and Craig's and spread my Barbies across the floor, spinning out scenarios that felt as real to me as life itself, sometimes inserting Craig's G. I. Joe action figures into the plotlines. I kept my dolls' outfits in a child-sized vinyl suitcase covered in a floral print. I assigned every Barbie and every G. I. Joe a personality. I also recruited into service the worn-out alphabet blocks my mother had used years earlier to teach us our letters. They, too, were given names and inner lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">I rarely chose to join the neighborhood kids who played outside after school, nor did I invite school friends home with me, in part because I was a fastidious kid and didn't want anyone meddling with my dolls. I'd been to other girls' houses and seen the horror-show scenarios -- Barbies whose hair had been hacked off or whose faces had been crosshatched with Magic Marker. And one thing I was learning at school was that kid dynamics could be messy. Whatever sweet scenes you might witness on a playground, beneath them lay a tyranny of shifting hierarchies and alliances. There were queen bees, bullies, and followers. I wasn't shy, but I also wasn't sure I needed any of that messiness in my life outside school. Instead, I sank my energy into being the sole animating force in my little common-area universe. If Craig showed up and had the audacity to move a single block, I'd start shrieking. I was also not above hitting him when necessary -- usually a direct fist blow to the middle of his back. The point was that the dolls and blocks needed me to give them life, and I dutifully gave it to them, imposing one personal crisis after another. Like any good deity, I was there to see them suffer and grow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, from my bedroom window, I could observe most of the real-world happenings on our block of Euclid Avenue. In the late afternoons, I'd see Mr. Thompson, the tall African American man who owned the three-unit building across the street, loading his big bass guitar into the back of his Cadillac, setting off for a gig in one jazz club or another. I'd watch the Mendozas, the Mexican family next door, arriving home in their pickup loaded with ladders after a long day of painting houses, greeted at the fence by their yapping dogs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our neighborhood was middle-class and racially mixed. Kids found one another based not on the color of their skin but on who was outside and ready to play. My friends included a girl named Rachel, whose mother was white and had a British accent; Susie, a curly-haired redhead; and the Mendozas' granddaughter whenever she was visiting. We were a motley mix of last names -- Kansopant, Abuasef, Yacker, Robinson -- and were too young to register that things around us were changing fast. In 1950, fifteen years before my parents moved to South Shore, the neighborhood had been 96 percent white. By the time I'd leave for college in 1981, it would be about 96 percent black.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were starting to feel the effects of this transition, especially at school. My second-grade classroom turned out to be a mayhem of unruly kids and flying erasers, which had not been the norm in either my experience or Craig's. All this seemed due to a teacher who couldn't figure out how to assert control -- who didn't seem to like children, even. Beyond that, it wasn't clear that anyone was particularly bothered by the fact that the teacher was incompetent. The students used it as an excuse to act out, and she seemed to think only the worst of us. In her eyes, we were a class of "bad kids," though we had no guidance and no structure and had been sentenced to a grim, underlit room in the basement of the school. Every hour there felt hellish and long. I sat miserably at my desk, in my puke-green chair -- puke green being the official color of the 1970s -- learning nothing and waiting for the midday lunch break, when I could go home and have a sandwich and complain to my mom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们也开始感觉到这种转变带来的影响，特别是在学校。我上二年级时，班里混乱不堪，孩子们闹哄哄的，橡皮乱飞，我和克雷格都没见过这种场面。教我们的老师不知道怎么维持课堂秩序，甚至也不喜欢孩子，而且并没有人特别在意这个老师是否称职。学生们以此为借口开始胡闹，而这位老师对我们的评价也极低。在她眼里，我们是一班“坏孩子”。就这样，我们没有人指导和组织，被发配到学校地下室一个阴冷昏暗的教室。在那里的每一分钟都让人感觉漫长而可憎。我极度郁闷地坐在书桌后的椅子上，那把椅子的颜色是像呕吐物一样的绿色，那是20世纪70年代的流行色。我在那里什么都学不到，只能枯坐到午餐休息时间，那时我可以回家吃个三明治，跟母亲吐吐苦水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Craig and I were raised squarely in the crosscurrents of that flux. The blocks surrounding us were home to Jewish families, immigrant families, white and black families, folks who were thriving and some who were not. In general, people tended to their lawns and kept track of their children. They wrote checks to Robbie so their kids could learn piano. My family, in fact, was probably on the poor side of the neighborhood spectrum. We were among the few people we knew who didn't own their own home, stuffed as we were into Robbie and Terry's second floor. South Shore hadn't yet tilted the way other neighborhoods had -- with the better-off people long departed for the suburbs, the neighborhood businesses closing one by one, the blight setting in -- but the tilt was clearly beginning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克雷格和我在时代变动的洪流中健康长大。我们周围的街区住着犹太家庭、移民家庭、黑人和白人通婚的家庭，有些人过得好，有些人过得不好。一般来说，人们都会修剪自家的草坪，看管自家的孩子。他们给萝比开支票，让自己的孩子学习钢琴。我家应该属于社区里比较穷的那个群体，因为我们是周边为数不多的没有自己房子的人，挤在萝比和特里家的二楼。那时，南岸社区还不像其他社区那样—富裕的人早已搬到了郊区，社区的商铺一家家地倒闭，经济一片萧条，但是这种趋势已经明显地出现了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a small but life-changing move. I didn't stop to ask myself then what would happen to all the kids who'd been left in the basement with the teacher who couldn't teach. Now that I'm an adult, I realize that kids know at a very young age when they're being devalued, when adults aren't invested enough to help them learn. Their anger over it can manifest itself as unruliness. It's hardly their fault. They aren't "bad kids." They're just trying to survive bad circumstances. At the time, though, I was just happy to have escaped. But I'd learn many years later that my mother, who is by nature wry and quiet but generally also the most forthright person in any room, made a point of seeking out the second-grade teacher and telling her, as kindly as possible, that she had no business teaching and should be working as a drugstore cashier instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件小事改变了我的人生。当时，我并没有想过那些留在地下室的孩子跟着一个不会教书的老师会怎样。现在作为一个成年人，我意识到孩子在很小的时候就能感觉到自己被贬低。当他们感觉到大人没有认真投入地教他们时，他们的怒气表现出来就是所谓的不服管教，而这并不是他们的错。他们不是“坏孩子”，只是在努力挨过糟糕的境遇。而当时，我只是庆幸自己脱离了苦海。许多年后，我才知道，当年母亲特意找到我二年级的那位老师，尽可能礼貌地跟她说，她不该当老师，而应该去杂货店当收银员。母亲生性安静、诙谐，但是在任何场合她都是最直率敢言的那一个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I got angry as a kid, I almost always funneled it through my mother. As I fumed about my new teacher, she listened placidly, saying things like "Oh, dear" and "Oh, really?" She never indulged my outrage, but she took my frustration seriously. If my mother were somebody different, she might have done the polite thing and said, "Just go and do your best." But she knew the difference. She knew the difference between whining and actual distress. Without telling me, she went over to the school and began a weeks-long process of behind-the-scenes lobbying, which led to me and a couple of other high-performing kids getting quietly pulled out of class, given a battery of tests, and about a week later reinstalled permanently into a bright and orderly third-grade class upstairs, governed by a smiling, no-nonsense teacher who knew her stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我小时候生气总会跟母亲倾诉。我气冲冲地抱怨那个新老师，她平静地听着，偶尔插一句“噢，天哪”和“噢，真的吗”。她并不纵容我的怒火，但是会认真对待我的沮丧。如果换作其他母亲，可能只会轻描淡写地说一句：“你尽力而为就好了。”但是我母亲知道发牢骚和真正的苦恼之间的差别。她没有告诉我就找到学校去，开始了持续数周的幕后游说工作。后来我和其他几个表现好的孩子被悄悄地从班里抽出来，经过一连串考试，在大约一周后插班进了楼上的三年级，那里光线充足、秩序井然，老师是一位笑眯眯的女士，她做事干练，课讲得很好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As time went by, my mother started nudging me to go outside and engage with kids in the neighborhood. She was hoping that I'd learn to glide socially the way my brother had. Craig, as I've mentioned, had a way of making hard things look easy. He was by then a growing sensation on the basketball court, high-spirited and agile and quickly growing tall. My father pushed him to seek out the toughest competition he could find, which meant that he would later send Craig across town on his own to play with the best kids in the city. But for now, he left him to wrangle the neighborhood talent. Craig would take his ball and carry it across the street to Rosenblum Park, passing the monkey bars and swing set where I liked to play, and then cross an invisible line, disappearing through a veil of trees to the far side of the park, where the basketball courts were. I thought of it as an abyss over there, a mythic dark forest of drunks and thugs and criminal goings-on, but Craig, once he started visiting that side of the park, would set me straight, saying that really nobody over there was all that bad.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was ten when I finally mellowed enough to start venturing out myself, a decision driven in large part by boredom. It was summer and school was out. Craig and I rode a bus to Lake Michigan every day to go to a rec camp run by the city at a beachfront park, but we'd be back home by four, with many daylight hours still to fill. My dolls were becoming less interesting, and without air-conditioning our apartment got unbearably hot in the late afternoons. And so I started tailing Craig around the neighborhood, meeting the kids I didn't already know from school. Across the alley behind our house, there was a mini housing community called Euclid Parkway, where about fifteen homes had been built around a common green space. It was a kind of paradise, free from cars and full of kids playing softball and jumping double Dutch or sitting on stoops, just hanging out. But before I could find my way into the fold of girls my age who hung out at the Parkway, I faced a test. It came in the form of DeeDee, a girl who went to a nearby Catholic school. DeeDee was athletic and pretty, but she wore her face in a pout and was always ready with an eye roll. She often sat on her family's stoop next to another, more popular girl named Deneen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Basketball, for my brother, seemed to unlock every frontier. It taught him how to approach strangers when he wanted to snag a spot in a pickup game. He learned how to talk a friendly form of smack, trash-talking his bigger, faster opponents on the court. It helped, too, to debunk various myths about who was who and what was what around the neighborhood, reinforcing the possibility -- something that had long been a credo of my dad's -- that most people were good people if you just treated them well.

<div class="line_en">The next time DeeDee made one of her remarks, I lunged for her, summoning everything my dad had taught me about how to throw a punch. The two of us fell to the ground, fists flailing and legs thrashing, every kid in Euclid Parkway instantly clustered in a tight knot around us, their hollers fueled by excitement and grade school bloodlust. I can't remember who finally pulled us apart, whether it was Deneen or my brother or maybe a parent who'd been called to the scene, but when it was done, some sort of silent baptism had taken place. I was officially an accepted member of the neighborhood tribe. DeeDee and I were unharmed, dirt stained and panting and destined never to be close friends, but at least I'd earned her respect.</div>

My morale began to sink. I understood that I had choices. I could continue on as the picked-on new girl, I could give up on the Parkway and just go back to my toys at home, or I could attempt to earn DeeDee's respect.

<div class="line_en">My father viewed rich people with a shade of suspicion. He didn't like people who were uppity and had mixed feelings about home ownership in general. There was a short period when he and my mom considered buying a home for sale not far from Robbie's house, driving over one day to inspect the place with a real estate agent, but ultimately deciding against it. At the time, I'd been all for it. In my mind, I thought it would mean something if my family could live in a place with more than one floor. But my father was innately cautious, aware of the trade-offs, understanding the need to maintain some savings for a rainy day. "You never want to end up house poor," he'd tell us, explaining how some people handed over their savings and borrowed too much, ending up with a nice home but no freedom at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we grew, we spoke more about drugs and sex and life choices, about race and inequality and politics. My parents didn't expect us to be saints. My father, I remember, made a point of saying that sex was and should be fun. They also never sugarcoated what they took to be the harder truths about life. Craig, for example, got a new bike one summer and rode it east to Lake Michigan, to the paved pathway along Rainbow Beach, where you could feel the breeze off the water. He'd been promptly picked up by a police officer who accused him of stealing it, unwilling to accept that a young black boy would have come across a new bike in an honest way. (The officer, an African American man himself, ultimately got a brutal tongue-lashing from my mother, who made him apologize to Craig.) What had happened, my parents told us, was unjust but also unfortunately common. The color of our skin made us vulnerable. It was a thing we'd always have to navigate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长大后，我们谈论得更多的是毒品、性以及人生选择，还有种族、不平等和政治。父母没有期望我们成为圣人。我记得父亲特意说过，性是快乐的，并且应该是快乐的。他们也从不美化生活残酷的一面。有一年夏天，克雷格买了一辆新自行车，一路向东骑至密歇根湖，到达彩虹海滩旁边的铺砌的道路上，在那儿感受湖面吹来的微风。但立即有一名警察以偷窃的罪名逮捕了克雷格，因为他不相信一个黑人男孩能通过正当手段得到一辆崭新的自行车。（这名警察自己也是非洲裔美国人。后来我母亲劈头盖脸地训斥了他一通，并让他向克雷格道了歉。）父母告诉我们，这件事不公平，但很不幸，它非常普遍。我们的肤色让我们处于弱势地位，但总要设法应对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My parents talked to us like we were adults. They didn't lecture, but rather indulged every question we asked, no matter how juvenile. They never hurried a discussion for the sake of convenience. Our talks could go on for hours, often because Craig and I took every opportunity to grill my parents about things we didn't understand. When we were little, we'd ask, "Why do people go to the bathroom?" or "Why do you need a job?" and then blitz them with follow-ups. One of my early Socratic victories came from a question driven by self-interest: "Why do we have to eat eggs for breakfast?" Which led to a discussion about the necessity of protein, which led me to ask why peanut butter couldn't count as protein, which eventually, after more debate, led to my mother revising her stance on eggs, which I had never liked to eat in the first place. For the next nine years, knowing that I'd earned it, I made myself a fat peanut butter and jelly sandwich for breakfast each morning and consumed not a single egg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父母跟我们交流时不把我们当小孩子。他们从不说教，对我们提出的问题有问必答，不管那些问题有多幼稚。他们从不随意敷衍我们。因为克雷格和我不放过任何一个机会来追问父母我们不懂的事情，谈话常常要持续几个小时。我们还小的时候，会问：“为什么人要上厕所？”或者：“你为什么要工作？”得到回答后还会继续追问。我曾出于自身利益的考虑，问过一个问题：“为什么我们早餐要吃鸡蛋？”这引发了一场关于补充蛋白质的必要性的讨论。然后，我问：“为什么花生酱不能算是蛋白质？”最终，经过进一步讨论，母亲改变了她关于鸡蛋的立场，这是我早期的一次苏格拉底式的胜利。在之后的九年时间里，我每天早晨给自己做一块抹花生酱和果酱的三明治，一个鸡蛋也不吃，这是我为自己争取的，要知道，我压根就不喜欢吃鸡蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now in his late thirties, my dad was focused on saving for us kids. Our family was never going to be house poor, because we weren't going to own a house. My father operated from a practical place, sensing that resources were limited and maybe so, too, was time. When he wasn't driving, he now used a cane to get around. Before I finished elementary school, that cane would become a crutch and soon after that two crutches. Whatever was eroding inside my father, withering his muscles and stripping his nerves, he viewed it as his own private challenge, as something to silently withstand.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father's habit of driving us through Pill Hill was a bit of an aspirational exercise, I would guess, a chance to show us what a good education could yield. My parents had spent almost their entire lives living within a couple of square miles in Chicago, but they had no illusions that Craig and I would do the same. Before they were married, both of them had briefly attended community colleges, but each had abandoned the exercise long before getting a degree. My mother had been studying to become a teacher but realized she'd rather work as a secretary. My father had simply run out of money to pay tuition, joining the Army instead. He'd had no one in his family to talk him into returning to school, no model of what that sort of life looked like. Instead, he served two years moving between different military bases. If finishing college and becoming an artist had been a dream for my father, he quickly redirected his hopes, using his wages to help pay for his younger brother's degree in architecture instead.</div>

Every year for the Air and Water Show, we packed a picnic and drove north along Lake Michigan to the fenced-off peninsula where my father's water filtration plant was located.

Every September, when Craig and I showed up back at Bryn Mawr Elementary, we'd find fewer white kids on the playground. Some had transferred to a nearby Catholic school, but many had left the neighborhood altogether. At first it felt as if just the white families were leaving, but then that changed, too. It soon seemed that anyone who had the means to go was now going. Much of the time, the departures went unannounced and unexplained.

<div class="line_en">How they afforded a place in the suburbs, I couldn't guess. Park Forest, it turns out, was one of America's first fully planned communities -- not just a housing subdivision, but a full village designed for about thirty thousand people, with shopping malls, churches, schools, and parks. Founded in 1948, it was, in many ways, meant to be the paragon of suburban life, with mass-produced houses and cookie-cutter yards. There were also quotas for how many black families could live on a given block, though by the time the Stewarts got there, the quotas had apparently been abolished.</div>

The two of them swapped recipes and kept up with each other, but never fell into the neighborhood's gossip cycle the way other mothers did. Mrs. Stewart's son, Donny, was Craig's age and just as athletic, giving the two of them an instant bond. Her daughter, Pamela, was a teenager already and not so interested in me, though I found all teenagers intriguing.

<div class="line_en">I've said before that my father was a withstander, a man who never complained about small things or big, who cheerily ate liver when it was served to him, who had a doctor give him what amounted to a death sentence and then just carried on. This thing with the car was no different. If there was some way to fight it, if there was some door to pound in response, my dad wouldn't have done it anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前面说过，我父亲是那种逆来顺受的人，他从不抱怨任何事，无论大小—给他上一盘肝脏，他会愉快地吃掉；医生给他判了死刑，他会继续若无其事地生活。这次车的事情也一样。就算可以抗争，可以去敲一扇门理论，父亲也不会那么做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We rode back to the city that night without much discussion about what had happened. It was too exhausting, maybe, to parse. In any event, we were done with the suburbs. My father must have had to drive the car to work the next day looking the way it did, and I'm sure that didn't sit well with him. But the gash in his chrome didn't stay for long. As soon as there was time, he took the car over to the body shop at Sears and had it erased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我们在开车回市区的路上没有过多地讨论这件事。也许是因为分析起来太累人了。不管怎样，我们都不会再去郊区了。父亲第二天还得开着车上班，可以肯定那道划痕让他很不舒服。没过多久，父亲一得了空，就把车开到西尔斯百货的车身修理厂，把那道划痕给抹掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Was somebody watching through a window as my father approached our car that night? Was there a shadow behind some curtain, waiting to see how things would go? I'll never know. I just remember the way my dad's body stiffened slightly when he reached the driver's side door and saw what was there. Someone had scratched a line across the side of his beloved Buick, a thin ugly gulch that ran across the door and toward the tail of the car. It had been done with a key or a rock and was in no way accidental.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，当父亲走向我们的车时，窗户后面是不是有双眼睛在盯着看？某个窗帘后，是不是有个黑影，在等着看会发生什么事？我不清楚。我只记得父亲走到驾驶座的车门前时，身体稍稍僵了一下。有人在他的爱车上划了一道，从车门一直划到车尾。那道划痕细长而丑陋，是用钥匙或者石头划出来的，可以肯定，绝不是意外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I'll be damned," he said, before unlocking the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是活见鬼！”他说，然后打开了车门。">查看中文翻译</div>
