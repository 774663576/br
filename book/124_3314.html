<div class="line_en">Augustus Waters died eight days after his prefuneral, at Memorial, in the ICU, when the cancer, which was made of him, finally stopped his heart, which was also made of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was with his mom and dad and sisters. His mom called me at three thirty in the morning. I'd known, of course, that he was going. I'd talked to his dad before going to bed, and he told me, "It could be tonight," but still, when I grabbed the phone from the bedside table and saw Gus's Mom on the caller ID, everything inside of me collapsed. She was just crying on the other end of the line, and she told me she was sorry, and I said I was sorry, too, and she told me that he was unconscious for a couple hours before he died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="临终时，他的妈妈、爸爸、两个姐姐都和他在一起。他妈妈凌晨三点半给我打来电话。当然，我已经知道，他恐怕坚持不了多久了。我睡前还跟他爸爸通过话，他告诉我：“可能就是今晚了。”可即便如此，当我从床头桌上抓起手机，看到来电显示“格斯妈妈”的时候，我心里的一切顷刻坍塌了。她在电话那头只是哭，然后对我说她很难过，我也说我很难过，她对我说，他临终前有几个小时已经失去意识了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I called Isaac, who cursed life and the universe and God Himself and who said where are the goddamned trophies to break when you need them, and then I realized there was no one else to call, which was the saddest thing.

<div class="line_en">It was unbearable. The whole thing. Every second worse than the last. I just kept thinking about calling him, wondering what would happen, if anyone would answer. In the last weeks, we'd been reduced to spending our time together in recollection, but that was not nothing: The pleasure of remembering had been taken from me, because there was no longer anyone to remember with. It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself, as if the things we'd done were less real and important than they had been hours before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无法忍受。整件事。每一秒钟都比刚才更糟。我不停地想要给他打电话，想知道会发生什么，会不会有人接起。过去几个礼拜里，我们在一起的时光已经只用来追忆往事，但那也不是一无所有；现在，我回忆的乐趣也被夺走了，因为已经没有人跟我一起回忆。感觉就像，失去一个同忆者就意味着失去了回忆本身，就好像与几个小时之前相比，我们从前一起做过的事也变得不那么真实、不那么重要了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When you go into the ER, one of the first things they ask you to do is to rate your pain on a scale of one to ten, and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them. I'd been asked this question hundreds of times over the years, and I remember once early on when I couldn't get my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire, flames licking the inside of my ribs fighting for a way to burn out of my body, my parents took me to the ER. A nurse asked me about the pain, and I couldn't even speak, so I held up nine fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你去急诊室，医务人员叫你做的第一件事情就是用从一到十的评估表评估你的疼痛等级，他们依据这个来确定用什么药，用得多快。几年来，这个问题我被问了几百次了，我记得很早的时候有一次，我喘不上气来，觉得胸口好像着火了，火舌从里面舔舐着我的两肋，想要杀出一条路烧出我的身体，爸妈把我送到急诊室，一个护士问我痛得怎么样，我连话都说不出来，于是举起了九个手指头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, after they'd given me something, the nurse came in and she was kind of stroking my hand while she took my blood pressure and she said, "You know how I know you're a fighter? You called a ten a nine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，他们给我用了不知什么药之后，那个护士进来了，给我量血压，同时轻轻摩挲着我的手，说：“你知道我怎么知道你有多坚强的吗？因为十级疼痛你只说是九级。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that wasn't quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring at the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff, leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她其实说得不太对。我说九级是因为我想留着十级以后用，而现在时候到了，巨大的、可怕的十级，一遍又一遍地猛烈摔打着我。我独自躺在床上，静静地凝视着天花板，让巨浪将我抛起，摔到岩石上，随后又将我扯回海里，好再一次把我推到尖利的悬崖上，最后让我一个人脸朝上在水里漂荡，却留下一条命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally I did call him. His phone rang five times and then went to voice mail. "You've reached the voice mail of Augustus Waters," he said, the clarion voice I'd fallen for. "Leave a message." It beeped. The dead air on the line was so eerie. I just wanted to go back to that secret post-terrestrial third space with him that we visited when we talked on the phone. I waited for that feeling, but it never came: The dead air on the line was no comfort, and finally I hung up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后我真给他打了电话。电话那头铃声响了五下，然后转到了语音信箱。“这里是奥古斯塔斯·沃特斯的语音信箱，”他的声音说，那曾令我倾心的清亮嗓音，“请留言。”然后是哔的一声。电话那头死寂的氛围如此诡异，令人悚然。我只想和他一起回到那个尘世之外的第三空间去，我们以前在电话里聊天时去过的秘密之地。我等着那种感觉，可它再也没出现：电话那头的死寂气息毫无慰藉之意，最后我只好挂断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">… Written by someone I'd never heard of. In fact, almost all the wall posts, which arrived nearly as fast as I could read them, were written by people I'd never met and whom he'd never spoken about, people who were extolling his various virtues now that he was dead, even though I knew for a fact they hadn't seen him in months and had made no effort to visit him.

<div class="line_en">I imagined the Augustus Waters analysis of that comment: If I am playing basketball in heaven, does that imply a physical location of a heaven containing physical basketballs? Who makes the basketballs in question? Are there less fortunate souls in heaven who work in a celestial basketball factory so that I can play? Or did an omnipotent God create the basketballs out of the vacuum of space? Is this heaven in some kind of unobservable universe where the laws of physics don't apply, and if so, why in the hell would I be playing basketball when I could be flying or reading or looking at beautiful people or something else I actually enjoy? It's almost as if the way you imagine my dead self says more about you than it says about either the person I was or the whatever I am now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想象了一下对这条留言的奥古斯塔斯·沃特斯式分析：如果此刻我在天堂里打篮球，那是不是意味着有“天堂”这么一个实质存在的地点，里面有着实质存在的篮球？那么这些篮球是谁制造的呢？天堂里也有些不那么幸运的灵魂在天上的篮球制造厂工作，好让我有球可打吗？还是说，有个全能的上帝无中生有地从真空中造出篮球？这个天堂是存在于某种无法观察的宇宙里，物理定律在那儿不起作用吗？设若如此，我明明可以飞来飞去、看书看报、欣赏美人或者干点儿别的我真心喜欢的事，到底为什么我还非要打篮球不可呢？简直可以这么说，你对我死后生活的想象既不能说明我曾经的人生，也不能说明我如今的境况，只能说明你自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
