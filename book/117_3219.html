<div class="line_en">In January 1607 three ships left England and sailed to America. There were a hundred and fifty men on the ships, and they wanted to find a new world in the west -- a home in a new and exciting country.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ships were at sea for four months, and they arrived in Virginia on the 26th April, 1607. After four long months at sea the men were tired, ill, and hungry. But Virginia was beautiful. The sky was blue, and they could see rivers, and flowers, and forests of tall trees. The Englishmen were very happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大海上飘泊了四个月后，船队终于在1607年4月26日抵达弗吉尼亚。在海上颠簸了漫长的四个月后，人们疲惫不堪、饥病交加。而弗吉尼亚是如此美丽迷人，湛蓝的天空下，到处都可以看到河流、鲜花，还有长满高大树木的森林。这些英国人高兴极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the Algonquin Indians of Virginia were not happy. They were afraid of the Englishmen and their ships. "This is our home," they said. "We don't want these white men here. We must fight them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而弗吉尼亚的阿尔冈昆印第安人可高兴不起来。他们害怕英国人和他们的船只。“这是我们的家园，”他们说，“我们可不想让这些白人待在这儿。我们必须与他们战斗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But some Indians said: "No, wait. These men are interesting. Let's make friends with them, and learn about them." So the Indians tried to talk to the Englishmen, and gave them food to eat. The Englishmen gave things to the Indians, too -- little knives and pictures and beads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但也有一些印第安人却说：“不，等一下。这些人蛮有趣的。我们来跟他们交朋友，了解一下他们。”于是印第安人试着去跟英国人交谈，还给他们食物吃。英国人也给印第安人一些诸如小刀、图画和珠子之类的东西作为回报。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Englishmen began to build a little town. They called it Jamestown, because the King of England was called James. They called the river James River, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Smith and Newport went a hundred kilometres up the river. They visited Indian villages and talked to a lot of Indians. Some of the Indians were friendly, and some were not. When Smith and Newport came back to Jamestown, Wingfield was very pleased to see them.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？”史密斯生气地问道，“我们的人必须时刻准备着，必须随身带枪。印第安人要杀你们是因为他们一点儿都不怕你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是呀，可是——我们必须要对他们友好。”温菲尔德说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We can be friendly, but we must be careful first," said Smith. "We must build good walls round the town, and put the big guns from the ships on them. Then the Indians can't kill us."</div>

<div class="line_en">In June Newport went back to England with two of the ships. A hundred and five men stayed in Jamestown. They had very little food. The corn from England was now bad, and the new corn in the fields was not ready. The river water was bad too, and soon many of the men were ill with a fever. Forty-six men died that summer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of the men tried to leave Jamestown and go home in the ship, but Smith stopped them. "We're here to work, and to build a new town," he said. "But first, we must find food.

Often, he gave the Indians little things from England, and they gave him food.</div>
