"There are cells down in the bowels of Casterly Rock where my lord father kept the worst of ours." He dipped his quill in the inkpot. Tyrion of House Lannister, he scratched out, promising to pay the bearer of the note one hundred golden dragons. Every stroke of the quill leaves me a little poorer… or would, if I were not a beggar to begin with. One day he might rue these signatures. But not this day. He blew on the wet ink, slid the parchment to the paymaster, and signed the one beneath. And again. And again. And again.

<div class="line_en">"I am dancing as fast as I can." He wanted to laugh, but that would have ruined the game. Plumm was enjoying this, and Tyrion had no intention of spoiling his fun. Let him go on thinking that he's bent me over and fucked me up the arse, and I'll go on buying steel swords with parchment dragons. If ever he went back to Westeros to claim his birthright, he would have all the gold of Casterly Rock to make good on his promises. If not, well, he'd be dead, and his new brothers could wipe their arses with these parchments. Perhaps some might turn up in King's Landing with their scraps in hand, hoping to convince his sweet sister to make good on them. And would that I could be a roach in the rushes to witness that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The writing on the parchments changed about halfway down the pile. The hundred-dragon notes were all for serjeants. Below them the amounts suddenly grew larger.

Stay inside as much as you can, and shit into your bucket. Too many eyes at the latrines. And never go beyond our camp without my leave. We can dress you up in squire's steel, pretend you're Jorah's butt boy, but there's some will see right through that.

<div class="line_en">Brown Ben's note was the last. That one had been inscribed upon a sheepskin scroll. One hundred thousand golden dragons, fifty hides of fertile land, a castle, and a lordship. Well and well. This Plumm does not come cheaply. Tyrion plucked at his scar and wondered if he ought to make a show of indignation. When you bugger a man you expect a squeal or two. He could curse and swear and rant of robbery, refuse to sign for a time, then give in reluctantly, protesting all the while. But he was sick of mummery, so instead he grimaced, signed, and handed the scroll back to Brown Ben. "Your cock is as big as in the stories," he said. "Consider me well and truly fucked, Lord Plumm."</div>

When they joined, where they fought, how long they served, the manner of their deaths -- all in the book. You will find famous names in here, some from your Seven Kingdoms. Aegor Rivers served a year with us, before he left to found the Golden Company. Bittersteel, you call him. The Bright Prince, Aerion Targaryen, he was a Second Son.

The demon's mask the slavers had burned into his right cheek to mark him for a dangerous and disobedient slave would never leave him. Ser Jorah had never been what one might call a comely man.

<div class="line_en">"Why should we need armor? We're only mummers. We just pretend to fight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们干嘛要带盔甲？我们只是伶人。我们只是假装要战斗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You pretend very well," said Tyrion, examining a shirt of heavy iron mail so full of holes that it almost looked moth-eaten. What sort of moths eat chainmail? "Pretending to be dead is one way to survive a battle. Good armor is another." Though there is precious little of that here, I fear. At the Green Fork, he had fought in mismatched scraps of plate from Lord Lefford's wagons, with a spiked bucket helm that made it look as if someone had upended a slops pail over his head. This company steel was worse. Not just old and ill fitting, but dinted, cracked, and brittle. Is that dried blood, or only rust? He sniffed at it but still could not be sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你装的真好，”提利昂说，检查一个看起来像被虫蛀了一样全是窟窿的重甲上衣。哪种蛀虫吃锁子甲？“在战斗中装死尸是一种活下来的方法，好的盔甲是另一种。”但是对于那点还是有点夸大其词的。在绿叉河，他战斗时穿的是一身从莱佛德大人的货车里找到的不合身的破铠甲和一个锥顶的看起来像有人扣了个马桶在他头上的水桶盔。这些军团的盔甲就更糟了，不光旧而不合身，而且濒临报废，满是裂缝，一打就烂。那是干涸的血或只是铁锈？他闻了闻，依旧无法分辨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion glanced at it. "I cannot use a stirrup winch. My legs are not long enough. A crank would serve me better." Though, if truth be told, he did not want a crossbow. They took too long to reload. Even if he lurked by the latrine ditch waiting for some enemy to take a squat, the chances of his losing more than one quarrel would not be good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂看了一眼。“我采不上镫型绞车，我的腿不够长。对我来说一个曲柄倒是不错。”但是若真说起来，他不想要个十字弓，得花太长时间重装箭，就算他能潜伏在公厕旁边等着某位敌人跑来蹲坑，他失败的几率大于发生争执可不是什么好兆头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead he picked up a morningstar, gave it a swing, put it down again. Too heavy. He passed over a warhammer (too long), a studded mace (also too heavy), and half a dozen longswords before he found a dirk he liked, a nasty piece of steel with a triangular blade. "This might serve," he said. The blade had a bit of rust on it, but that would only make it nastier. He found a wood-and-leather sheath that fit and slipped the dirk inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was not all wrong. Yezzan's slaves ate better than many peasants back in the Seven Kingdoms and were less like to starve to death come winter. Slaves were chattels, aye. They could be bought and sold, whipped and branded, used for the carnal pleasure of their owners, bred to make more slaves. In that sense they were no more than dogs or horses. But most lords treated their dogs and horses well enough. Proud men might shout that they would sooner die free than live as slaves, but pride was cheap. When the steel struck the flint, such men were rare as dragon's teeth; elsewise the world would not have been so full of slaves. There has never been a slave who did not choose to be a slave, the dwarf reflected. Their choice may be between bondage and death, but the choice is always there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在有些事上说的没错。耶赞的奴隶比七大王国的许多农夫都吃的好药而在即将到来的严冬中也不太可能饿死。奴隶是财产，没错。他们会被买卖鞭打和烙印，满足主人的肉欲，生出更多的奴隶。从哪方面将他们与畜生相比好不了多少。但是大多数的大人们对待他们的畜生倒是很好。骄傲的男人可能会叫嚣他们宁愿死也不做奴隶，但是自尊是廉价的玩意儿。当磨刀霍霍时，这样叫嚣的人马上就少到和龙齿一样珍贵了；要不是那样，这个世界也不会到处都是奴隶了。没有什么奴隶的身份不是自己选择的，侏儒想到，即使他们只有奴役和死亡两个选项，也一直有选择的余地。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sweets was the first to go." Their mammoth master had died on the day of their escape, Brown Ben Plumm had told him. Neither he nor Kasporio nor any of the other sellswords knew the fate of the denizens of Yezzan's grotesquerie… but if Pretty Penny needed lies to stop her mooning, lie to her he would. "If you want to be a slave again, I will find you a kind master when this war is done, and sell you for enough gold to get me home," Tyrion promised her.
