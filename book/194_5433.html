<div class="line_en">The truck's front end looked worse than Langdon had imagined. The left headlight was gone, and the right one looked like an eyeball dangling from its socket. Langdon straightened it, and it dislodged again. The only good news was that the front bumper had been torn almost clean off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="装甲车的车头看上去比兰登想象的还要糟。左边的车头灯已经不见了，右边的那个就像在眼窝里晃荡的眼球。兰登把它塞回原处，它又滚落出来，唯一让人高兴的就是前保险杠就快要掉下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As if this burden were not great enough, Langdon now realized that any possibility of finding away to return the keystone to the Priory had just evaporated. News of the three additional murders had dire implications. The Priory has been infiltrated. They are compromised. The brotherhood was obviously being watched, or there was a mole within the ranks. It seemed to explain why Saunière might have transferred the keystone to Sophie and Langdon -- people outside the brotherhood, people he knew were not compromised. We can't very well give the keystone back tothe brotherhood. Even if Langdon had any idea how to find a Priory member, chances were good that whoever stepped forward to take the keystone could be the enemy himself. For the moment, at least, it seemed the keystone was in Sophie and Langdon's hands, whether they wanted it or not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登感到肩头的担子沉重，因为他知道他们不能再将楔石送还隐修会了。另外三个人遇害的消息说明已经有外人打人了隐修会内部，他们妥协了。显然，隐修会的成员被人监视着，要么就是组织里混进了奸细。看来这就是索尼埃把楔石交给索菲和兰登的原因——他们不是隐修会的成员，他们是不会妥协的人。把楔石交还给隐修会是不妥当的。即使兰登有办法找到隐修会的成员，但很有可能来拿楔石的人恰恰就是敌人。至少现在，不管索菲和兰登想不想要，楔石还在他们手里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bumper broke off suddenly with a crash. Langdon paused to catch his breath. At least the truck would no longer look like a Fourth of July sparkler. He grabbed the bumper and began dragging it out of sight into the woods, wondering where they should go next. They had no idea how to open the cryptex, or why Saunière had given it to them.

<div class="line_en">Langdon understood her concerns. Saunière had given the cryptex directly to Sophie, and although she didn't know what it contained or what she was supposed to do with it, she was hesitant to involve a total stranger. Considering the information potentially enclosed, the instinct was probably a good one. "We don't need to tell Teabing about the keystone immediately. Or at all, even. His house will give us a place to hide and think, and maybe when we talk to him about the Grail, you'll start to have an idea why your grandfather gave this to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='兰登明白她的担忧。索尼埃把密码筒交给了索菲，虽然索菲不知道里面装着什么，也不知道如何处置它，可她不会情愿把一个陌生人牵扯到这件事里来。密码筒里可能隐藏着重大秘密，凭直觉办事也许没错。"我们不需要马上告诉提彬关于楔石的事。或者根本就不告诉他。我们可以藏在他家，同时也可以好好思考一下。也许当我们跟他谈论圣杯的时候。你能搞明白祖父把楔石交给你的原因呢。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
