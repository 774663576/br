<div class="line_en">When Tereza's mother realized that her aggressiveness no longer had any power over her daughter, she started writing her querulous letters, complaining about her husband, her boss, her health, her children, and assuring Tereza she was the only person left in her life. Tereza thought that at last, after twenty years, she was hearing the voice of her mother's love, and felt like going back. All the more because she felt so weak, so debilitated by Tomas's infidelities. They exposed her powerlessness, which in turn led to vertigo, the insuperable longing to fall.</div>

<div class="line_en">True, Tereza fought with her mother until the day she left home, but let us not forget that she never stopped loving her. She would have done anything for her if her mother had asked in a loving voice. The only reason she found the strength to leave was that she never heard that voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎离家出走之前，的确一直在和母亲斗，但是别忘了她对母亲同时还有一份伤心的爱。如果母亲的声音中带着爱，无论要她做什么，她都会去做的。可惜她从没有听到这样的声音，这最终给了她出走的力量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The news transformed into rebellion Tereza's despair at Tomas's infidelities. She had betrayed her mother, she told herself reproachfully, and for a man who did not love her. She was willing to forget everything her mother had done to torture her. She was in a position to understand her now; they were in the same situation: her mother loved her stepfather just as Tereza loved Tomas, and her stepfather tortured her mother with his infidelities just as Tomas galled her with his. The cause of her mother's malice was that she had suffered so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到这个消息，因为托马斯的不忠一度陷入绝望中不能自拔的特蕾莎由绝望变成了反抗。她责怪自己为了一个不爱她的男人背叛了自己的母亲。她准备忘记母亲给她造成的所有痛苦。眼下，她甚至已经可以谅解她。母女俩处于同样的境况：母亲爱她的丈夫，如同特蕾莎爱着托马斯，继父拈花惹草给母亲带来的痛苦，正如托马斯的不忠给她的折磨。如果说母亲曾经对她很坏，那只是因为母亲太不幸了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tereza obeyed Tomas and did not go to visit her mother. Several hours after the decision she fell in the street and injured her knee. She began to teeter as she walked, fell almost daily, bumped into things or, at the very least, dropped objects.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sensing that the real reason calling her back to her mother was vertigo, Tomas opposed the trip. He rang up the hospital in the small town. Meticulous records of the incidence of cancer were kept throughout the country, so he had no trouble finding out that Tereza's mother had never been suspected of having the disease nor had she even seen a doctor for over a year.</div>
