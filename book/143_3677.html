<div class="line_en">The Festa was the greatest event of the year in each town, greater than Easter or Christmas or New Year's, greater than the days celebrating the end of the great war or the birthday of a great national hero. The Festa was dedicated to the town's own particular favorite saint. It was one of the few customs the Fascist government of Mussolini had dared not meddle with or try to forbid.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then as the great day approached, the Committee of Three started to spend the special fund accumulated over the past year. They hired a band, and they hired a clown. They set up generous money prizes for horse races to be held over the three days. They hired specialists to decorate the church and the streets so that the grim poverty-stricken town of Montelepre suddenly looked like some medieval citadel in the midst of the Fields of the Cloths of Gold. A puppet theater was hired. Food peddlers set up their booths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着这个盛大节日的临近，三人委员会开始使用过去一年中积累的这笔特别款项。他们雇来一个乐队，雇了一个小丑，并为未来三天举行的赛马设立了不菲的奖金。他们还雇请专人把小教堂和大街小巷都打扮起来。这样一来，破烂不堪的蒙特莱普雷顿时就变得像金缕地的中世纪城堡。他们还请来一个木偶剧团。叫卖食品的小贩都设立起摊点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The families of Montelepre used the Festa to show their marriageable daughters; new clothes were bought, chaperones detailed. A bevy of prostitutes from Palermo set up a huge tent just outside of town, their licenses and medical certificates adorning the red-, white-, and green-striped canvas sides. A famous holy friar, who years ago had grown stigmata, was hired to preach the formal sermon. And finally, on the third day, the saint's bier was carried through the streets followed by all the townspeople, with their livestock of mules, horses, pigs and donkeys. On top of the bier rode the effigy of the saint, crusted with money, flowers, varicolored sweets and great bamboo-sheathed bottles of wine.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the first day of the Montelepre Festa, Turi Guiliano was designated to take part in the opening ritual, the mating of the Miracle Mule of Montelepre with the town's largest and strongest donkey. It is rare that a female mule can conceive; they are classified as a sterile animal, product of the union between a mare and donkey. But there was such a mule in Montelepre; it had borne a donkey two years before, and its owner had agreed, as his family's duty share to the town Festa, to donate the mule's services and, if the miracle should occur, its offspring to the next year's Festa. There was in this particular ceremony a sardonic mockery.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Catholic religious festivals had sprung from ancient pagan rituals to beg miracles from the gods. On this fateful day in September 1943, during the Festa of the town of Montelepre, a miracle would occur that would change the fate of its seven thousand inhabitants.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the ritualistic mating was only partly a mockery. The Sicilian peasant has an affinity with his mule and donkey. They are hard-working beasts, and like the peasant himself have flinty, dour natures. Like the peasant they can work steadily for very long hours without breaking down, unlike the higher-nobility horse, who must be pampered. Also, they are surefooted and can pick their way along the mountain terraces without falling and breaking a leg, unlike the fiery stallions or the high-blooded, flighty mares. Also, peasant and donkey and mule subsist and thrive on food that kills other men and animals. But the greatest affinity was this: Peasant, donkey and mule had to be treated with affection and respect, otherwise they turned murderous and stubborn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过这种仪式性的交配不全是讽刺。西西里的农民与他们的骡子和驴子有很多相似之处。这里的骡子和驴子都很能干活，而且像农民一样坚韧、顽强。它们像农民一样，连续干几个小时活也累不倒，不像身份高贵的马那样娇气。它们的脚力稳健，在山上的梯田里干活，不像脾气暴烈的公马和反复无常的良种母马跌倒摔断腿。而且，其他人或动物不吃的东西，农民、骡子和驴都能吃下去维持生命，而且活得很好。不过最大的共同点还是：无论是农民还是骡和驴都必须受到关爱和尊重，否则他们就会变得脾气暴戾，难以驾驭。">查看中文翻译</div>

He then gave a speech to the other men urging them not to work, to let the harvest rot. The carabinieri arrested him on charges made by the Baron. The other men went back to work. Guiliano had not shown any hard feelings toward these men or even the carabinieri. When he was released from prison through the intervention of Hector Adonis, he developed no rancor of any kind.

The night before, Turi Guiliano, his cousin Gaspare "Aspanu" Pisciotta and a few other youths had been playing billiards. Some of the older men of the town had been watching them while drinking glasses of wine. One of the men, by the name of Guido Quintana, was slightly drunk. He was a man of reputation. He had been imprisoned by Mussolini for being a suspected member of the Mafia.

<div class="line_en">As well as any Sicilian. Turi Guiliano knew the legendary power of the Mafia. In these past few months of freedom, its snakelike head had begun weaving over the land, as if fertilized by the fresh loam of a new democratic government. It was already whispered in town that shopkeepers were paying "insurance" to certain "men of respect." And of course Turi knew the history, the countless murders of peasants who tried to collect their wages from powerful nobles and landlords, how tightly the Mafia had controlled the island before Mussolini had decimated them with his own disregard for the lawful process, like a deadlier snake biting a less powerful reptile with its poisoned fangs. So Turi Guiliano sensed the terror that lay ahead.</div>

His aim in the next few months was to establish respect in the eyes of the townspeople.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everybody was watching. The insult was not mortal. If the man were younger or the insult more pointed, Guiliano would have been forced to fight and keep his reputation for manhood. Aspanu Pisciotta always carried a knife, and now he positioned himself to intercept Quintana's friends if they decided to interfere. Pisciotta had no respect for older people, and he expected his friend and cousin to finish the quarrel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Or perhaps it was the handsomeness of Guiliano that irritated him, for Guido Quintana was an extremely ugly man. His appearance was intimidating not from any single feature but from a lifelong habit of presenting a formidable front to the outside world. Or perhaps it was the natural antagonism of a born villain toward a born hero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是吉里安诺的英俊激怒了他，因为他自己相貌极其丑陋。他长得吓人不是因为五官不正，而是因为他习惯于摆出一副令人望而生畏的样子。天生的恶棍对天生的英雄有着天然的敌意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In any case he got up suddenly just in time to jostle Guiliano as he went by to the other side of the billiard table. Turi, naturally courteous to a much older man, made an apology that was gentle and sincere. Guido Quintana looked him up and down with contempt. "Why aren't you home sleeping and resting to earn your bread tomorrow?" he said. "My friends have been waiting to play billiards for an hour." He reached out and took the billiard cue from Guiliano's hand and, smiling slightly, waved him away from the table.</div>

<div class="line_en">But at that moment Guiliano felt a strange uneasiness. The man looked so intimidating and ready for the most serious consequences of any dispute. The companions in the background, also older men, were smiling in an amused way as if they had no doubt of the outcome. One of them wore hunting attire and carried a rifle. Guiliano himself was unarmed. And then for one shameful moment, he felt fear. He was not afraid of being hurt, of being struck, of finding this man was the stronger of the two. It was the fear that these men knew what they were doing, that they had the situation under control. He did not. That they could gun him down in the dark streets of Montelepre as he walked home. That he would appear a dead fool the next day. It was the inborn tactical sense of the born guerrilla soldier that made him retreat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻吉里安诺感到一阵莫名其妙的不安。眼前这个人气势汹汹，好像准备应对最严重的后果。他身后的同伴都不年轻了，他们饶有兴趣地笑着，似乎对出现什么结局毫不怀疑。其中有个人身穿猎装，还带了一支步枪。吉里安诺赤手空拳，一时之下感到一阵难以启齿的恐惧。他并不是害怕受到伤害或者被他打几下，也不是害怕这个比他壮实的人。他害怕的是，这些人知道自己在干什么，而且控制着局面。他却做不到。他们可以在他回家的时候，在蒙特莱普雷背街的小巷朝他打黑枪。第二天人们会发现他像个傻瓜似的死在街上。促使他忍让的，是一个天才的游击战士与生俱来的作战直觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano slept badly and woke in that sullen mood so dangerous in adolescent males. He seemed to himself ridiculous. He had always wanted to be a hero, like most young men. If he had lived in any other part of Italy he would have become a soldier long before, but as a true Sicilian he had not volunteered, and his godfather, Hector Adonis, had made certain arrangements so that he wouldn't be called. After all, though Italy governed Sicily, no true Sicilian felt he was an Italian. And then, if the truth be told, the Italian government itself was not so anxious to draft Sicilians, especially in the last year of the war. Sicilians had too many relatives in America, Sicilians were born criminals and renegades, Sicilians were too stupid to be trained in modern warfare and they caused trouble wherever they went.</div>

<div class="line_en">The elaborate decorations of the Festa -- the streets overhung with an aerial maze of colorful papier-mache saints, the houses decorated with great bamboo-strutted flowers -- disguised the essential poverty of what was a typical Sicilian town.

<div class="line_en">From the far end of the Via Bella, the end of the street that led into the road of the Castellammare plain, Turi could see Aspanu Pisciotta leading a small donkey. For a moment he was worried about how Aspanu would treat him after his humiliation of the night before. His friend was noted for his sharp wit. Would he make some contemptuous remark? Guiliano felt again the rush of futile rage and swore he would not be so unready again. There would be no regard for any consequences, he would show them all he was no coward. Yet in a corner of his mind he saw the whole scene sharp and clear. Quintana's friends waiting behind him, one of them with a hunting rifle. They were Friends of the Friends and would avenge themselves. He did not fear them, he feared only his defeat by them, which seemed so sure because though they were not so strong, they were more cruel.</div>

<div class="line_en">In good weather the people lived outside their houses. The women sat in wooden chairs on their cobbled terraces preparing food for their tables, also set outside the door. Young children filled the streets chasing chickens, turkeys, young goats; older children wove bamboo baskets. At the end of the Via Bella, before it emptied into the square, was a huge demon-faced fountain, built by the Greeks two thousand years before, water pouring from its rock-toothed mouth. Alongside the surrounding mountains green gardens grew precariously, built on terraces. On the plains below were the visible towns of Partinico and Castellammare; the bloody dark stone town of Corleone lurked murderously beyond the horizon.</div>

He was in the small spot of earth in which he had been born and spent his life. The outside world could never harm him. Even the humiliation of the night before had disappeared. He knew those looming limestone mountains as intimately as a little child knew his sandbox. Those mountains grew slabs of stone as easily as they grew grass, and formed caves and hiding places that could shelter an army.

<div class="line_en">From another entrance to the square appeared a farmer leading the Miracle Mule. This was the man who had employed them for this morning's work. His name was Papera, and he was held in much respect by the citizens of Montelepre for having waged a successful vendetta against a neighbor. They had quarreled over an adjoining piece of land which held an olive grove. The quarrel went on for ten years, had in fact lasted longer than all of the wars Mussolini had foisted on Italy. Then one night shortly after the Allied Armies had liberated Sicily and installed a democratic government, the neighbor had been found almost cut in two by the blast of a lupara, the sawed-off shotgun so popular in Sicily for such matters. Suspicion immediately fell on Papera, but he had conveniently allowed himself to be arrested in a quarrel with the carabinieri and had spent the night of the murder safely in the prison cell of the Bellampo Barracks. It was rumored that this was the first sign of the old Mafia coming to life, that Papera -- related by marriage to Guido Quintana -- had enlisted the Friends of the Friends to help settle the quarrel.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="就在皮肖塔与玛丽亚·隆巴尔多逗乐的时候，图里·吉里安诺去了自己在楼上的卧室，做一些出门前的准备，特别是要带上他藏在那里的一把手枪。他没有忘记前一天晚上的屈辱，决定今天去干活的时候把武器带上。他知道如何用枪，因为父亲经常带他出去打猎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She understood this. And in her own fierce Sicilian pride was proud of him. Many years ago her own pride, her anger at her poverty, had led her to persuade her husband to try a new life in America. She had been a dreamer, she had believed in justice and her own rightful place in the world. She had saved a fortune in America, and that same pride had made her decide to return to Sicily to live like a queen. And then everything had turned to ashes. The lira became worthless in wartime, and she was poor again. She was resigned to her fate but hoped for her children. And she was happy when Turi showed the same spirit that had possessed her. But she dreaded the day when he must come into conflict with the stone-hard realities of life in Sicily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她能够理解这一点。出于西西里人强烈的自豪感，她为他感到骄傲。许多年前，正是出于这种自豪感，加之对贫困的愤怒，她说服丈夫去美国，开始新的生活。她有过美好的梦想，相信这个世界上有公平正义，应该有属于自己的一块地方。她在美国积攒了一笔钱，但又是这种自豪感促使她决心回到西西里，过女王一样的生活。可是后来一切都化成了泡影。战争时期，里拉变得一文不值，她又变得一贫如洗。她只能听天由命，把希望寄托在孩子们身上。看到图里身上表现出她曾经有过的那种精神，她感到非常欣慰。可是她又害怕将来有一天，图里也必须直面西西里残酷现实的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She watched him go out into the cobbled street of the Via Bella to greet Aspanu Pisciotta. Her son, Turi, walked like a huge cat, his chest so broad, his arms and legs so muscular he made Aspanu seem no more than a stalk of sisal grass. Aspanu had the hard cunning that her son lacked, the cruelty in his courage. Aspanu would guard Turi against the treacherous world they all had to live in. And she had a weakness for Aspanu's olive-skinned prettiness, though she believed her son more handsome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看着图里走到外面卵石铺就的贝拉大街上去迎接阿斯帕努·皮肖塔。她儿子走起路来像一只大型的猫科动物，胸膛宽阔，胳膊和腿的肌肉发达，相比之下，阿斯帕努简直像根瘦麻秆儿。不过她儿子不像阿斯帕努那样狡猾和残暴。在他们共同生活的这个充满危险的世界里，阿斯帕努会保护图里的。她喜欢阿斯帕努橄榄色皮肤的俊秀，但是她觉得自己的儿子更英俊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally the two men and their donkey vanished over a rise in the street, but she kept watching and finally they appeared again, high above the town of Montelepre, entering the range of mountains that surrounded the town. Maria Lombardo Guiliano kept watching, as if she would never see them again, until they disappeared in the late morning mist around the mountaintop. They were vanishing into the beginning of their myth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看着两个人和一头驴消失在街道的起伏处，最后出现在高高的山梁上，进入环抱蒙特莱普雷的大山。玛丽亚·隆巴尔多·吉里安诺凝神注视着，好像今后再也见不着他们了。她就这样看着他们逐渐消失在半晌山头的薄雾之中，消失在一段传奇故事的序幕里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She watched them go up the Via Bella to where it led out of town toward the Castellammare plain. Her son, Turi Guiliano, and her sister's son, Gaspare Pisciotta. Two young men just barely twenty years old, and seeming younger than their years. She loved them both and she feared for them both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她目送他们沿贝拉大街走向镇外通往海堡平原的路。这两个年轻人，一个是她的儿子图里·吉里安诺，一个是她妹妹的儿子加斯帕尔·皮肖塔，都刚刚二十岁，但看上去还很年少。她喜欢这两个孩子，同时也为他们担惊受怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
