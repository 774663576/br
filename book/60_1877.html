<div class="line_en">Of course, Tereza did not know the story of the night when her mother whispered Be careful into the ear of her father. Her guilty conscience was as vague as original sin. But she did what she could to rid herself of it. Her mother took her out of school at the age of fifteen, and Tereza went to work as a waitress, handing over all her earnings. She was willing to do anything to gain her mother's love. She ran the household, took care of her siblings, and spent all day Sunday cleaning house and doing the family wash. It was a pity, because she was the brightest in her class. She yearned for something higher, but in the small town there was nothing higher for her. Whenever she did the clothes, she kept a book next to the tub. As she turned the pages, the wash water dripped all over them.</div>

<div class="line_en">At home, there was no such thing as shame. Her mother marched about the flat in her underwear, sometimes braless and sometimes, on summer days, stark naked. Her stepfather did not walk about naked, but he did go into the bathroom every time Tereza was in the bath. Once she locked herself in and her mother was furious. Who do you think you are, anyway? Do you think he's going to bite off a piece of your beauty?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个家里，不存在什么廉耻心。母亲穿着内衣在房间里走来走去，有时候连胸罩也不穿，夏天有时甚至一丝不挂。继父倒不光着身子乱走，但他总是等特蕾莎洗澡的时候往浴室里闯。有一天她在里面把门锁上了，母亲大发脾气：“你以为你是谁？你以为自己怎么样？你美，他不会把你的美吃了的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tereza quickly ran to pull the curtains so that no one could see her from across the street. She heard her mother's laughter behind her. The following day her mother had some friends over: a neighbor, a woman she worked with, a local schoolmistress, and two or three other women in the habit of getting together regularly. Tereza and the sixteen-year-old son of one of them came in at one point to say hello, and her mother immediately took advantage of their presence to tell how Tereza had tried to protect her mother's modesty. She laughed, and all the women laughed with her. Tereza can't reconcile herself to the idea that the human body pisses and farts, she said. Tereza turned bright red, but her mother would not stop. What's so terrible about that? and in answer to her own question she broke wind loudly. All the women laughed again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎怕对面楼里的人看见，跑过去拉上窗帘，然而她却听见身后母亲在笑。第二天，母亲的几个朋友来看她。有一个邻居，一个商店的同事，一个本区的小学教师和另外两三个经常见面的女人。特蕾莎过来和她们待了一会儿，有一个女人的儿子也在一旁陪着，那是一个十六岁的男孩。母亲乘机谈起特蕾莎如何护着自己，生怕丢脸。她边说边笑，其他女人也哈哈大笑。接着，母亲又说：“特蕾莎连人要撒尿放屁的都不愿承认。”特蕾莎满脸通红，母亲依然不依不饶：“这有什么难为情的？”她说着便给了自己一个响亮的回答——一连放了几个响屁。女人们笑作一团。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(This confrontation shows clearly that hatred for her daughter outweighed suspicion of her husband. Her daughter's guilt was infinite and included the husband's infidelities. Tereza's desire to be emancipated and insist on her rights -- like the right to lock herself in the bathroom -- was more objectionable to Tereza's mother than the possibility of her husband's taking a prurient interest in Tereza.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（这种状况显然表明母亲对女儿的仇恨远超过丈夫带给她的嫉妒。一切都是女儿的过错，甚至包括她丈夫的不忠。女儿居然也要自由，敢争什么权利——比如洗澡时插上门之类的权利，对母亲来说，这远比丈夫想占特蕾莎的便宜更不可接受。）">查看中文翻译</div>
