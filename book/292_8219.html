<div class="line_en">The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, said 'Bother!' and 'O blow!' and also 'Hang spring-cleaning!' and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat. Something up above was calling him imperiously, and he made for the steep little tunnel which answered in his case to the gravelled carriage-drive owned by animals whose residences are nearer to the sun and air. So he scraped and scratched and scrabbled and scrooged and then he scrooged again and scrabbled and scratched and scraped, working busily with his little paws and muttering to himself, 'Up we go! Up we go!' till at last, pop! his snout came out into the sunlight, and he found himself rolling in the warm grass of a great meadow.</div>

<div class="line_en">'This is fine!' he said to himself. 'This is better than whitewashing!' The sunshine struck hot on his fur, soft breezes caressed his heated brow, and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout. Jumping off all his four legs at once, in the joy of living and the delight of spring without its cleaning, he pursued his way across the meadow till he reached the hedge on the further side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太棒了！”他自言自语说，“可比刷墙有意思！”太阳晒在他的毛皮上，暖烘烘的，微风轻抚着他发热的额头，在洞穴里蛰居了那么久，听觉都变得迟钝了，连小鸟儿欢快的鸣唱，听起来都跟大声喊叫一样。生活的欢乐，春天的愉悦，又加上免了大扫除的麻烦，他乐得纵身一跳，腾起四脚向前飞跑，横穿草坪，一直跑到草坪尽头的篱笆前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was bowled over in an instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, who trotted along the side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly from their holes to see what the row was about. 'Onion-sauce! Onion-sauce!' he remarked jeeringly, and was gone before they could think of a thoroughly satisfactory reply. Then they all started grumbling at each other. 'How STUPID you are! Why didn't you tell him --' 'Well, why didn't YOU say --' 'You might have reminded him --' and so on, in the usual way; but, of course, it was then much too late, as is always the case.</div>

<div class="line_en">It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, along the hedgerows, across the copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting -- everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering 'whitewash!' he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens. After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都那么美好，好得简直不像是真的。他跑过一片又一片的草坪，沿着矮树篱，穿过灌木丛，匆匆地游逛。处处都看到鸟儿做窝筑巢，花儿含苞待放，叶儿挤挤嚷嚷——万物都显得快乐，忙碌，奋进。他听不到良心在耳边嘀咕：“刷墙！”只觉得，在一大群忙忙碌碌的公民当中，做一只唯一的懒狗，是多么惬意。看来，过休假日最舒心的方面，还不是自己得到休憩，而是看到别人都在忙着干活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver-glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated. By the side of the river he trotted as one trots, when very small, by the side of a man who holds one spell-bound by exciting stories; and when tired at last, he sat on the bank, while the river still chattered on to him, a babbling procession of the best stories in the world, sent from the heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他漫无目的地闲逛着，忽然来到一条水流丰盈的大河边，他觉得真是快乐绝顶了。他这辈子还从来没有见过一条河哩。这只光光滑滑、蜿蜿蜒蜒、身躯庞大的动物，不停地追逐，轻轻地欢笑。它每抓住什么，就格格低笑，把它们扔掉时，又哈哈大笑，转过来又扑向新的玩伴。它们挣扎着甩开了它，可到底还是被它逮住，抓牢了。它浑身颤动，晶光闪闪，沸沸扬扬，吐着旋涡，冒着泡沫，喋喋不休地唠叨个没完。这景象，简直把鼹鼠看呆了，他心驰神迷，像着了魔似的。他沿着河边，迈着小碎步跑，像个小娃娃紧跟在大人身边，听他讲惊险故事，听得入了迷似的。他终于跑累了，在岸边坐了下来。可那河还是一个劲儿向他娓娓而谈，它讲的是世间最好听的故事。这些故事发自地心深处，一路讲下去，最终要向那听个没够的大海倾诉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the bank opposite, just above the water's edge, caught his eye, and dreamily he fell to considering what a nice snug dwelling-place it would make for an animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside residence, above flood level and remote from noise and dust. As he gazed, something bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it, vanished, then twinkled once more like a tiny star. But it could hardly be a star in such an unlikely situation; and it was too glittering and small for a glow-worm. Then, as he looked, it winked at him, and so declared itself to be an eye; and a small face began gradually to grow up round it, like a frame round a picture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他坐在草地上，朝着河那边张望时，忽见对岸有个黑黑的洞口，恰好在水面上边。他梦悠悠地想，要是一只动物要求不过高，只想有一处小巧玲珑的河边住宅，涨潮时淹不着，又远离尘嚣，这个住所倒是满舒适的。他正呆呆地凝望，忽觉得，那洞穴的中央有个亮晶晶的小东西一闪，忽隐忽现，像一颗小星星。不过，出现在那样一个地方，不会是星星。要说是萤火虫嘛，又显得太亮，也太小。望着望着，那个亮东西竟冲他眨巴了一下，可见那是一只眼睛。接着，围着那只眼睛，渐渐显出一张小脸，恰像一幅画，嵌在画框里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="河鼠二话没说，弯腰解开一条绳子，拽拢来，然后轻轻地跨进鼹鼠原先没有注意到的一只小船。那小船外面漆成蓝色，里面漆成白色，鼹鼠的心，一下子飞到了小船上，虽然他还不大明白它的用场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Rat sculled smartly across and made fast. Then he held up his forepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down. 'Lean on that!' he said. 'Now then, step lively!' and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found himself actually seated in the stern of a real boat.</div>

Whether in winter or summer, spring or autumn, it's always got its fun and its excitements.

And I'll teach you to row, and to swim, and you'll soon be as handy on the water as any of us.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这没什么，祝福你！”河鼠轻松地答道，“一只河鼠嘛，弄湿点儿算什么？多数日子，我呆在水里的时间比呆在岸上还长哩。你就别再惦着了。这么着吧，我真的希望，你来跟我一道住些时候。我的家很普通，很简陋，根本没法和蟾蜍的家相比。可你还没来我家看过哩。你来了，我会让你过得舒舒服服的。而且，我还能教你学会划船，游泳，你很快就能像我们一样，在水上自由自在了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could find no voice to answer him; and he had to brush away a tear or two with the back of his paw. But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and presently the Mole's spirits revived again, and he was even able to give some straight back-talk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to each other about his bedraggled appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番亲切体贴的话，感动得鼹鼠说不出话来，只用爪子背儿抹去一两滴眼泪。可是善解人意的河鼠把眼光移向了别处。不一会儿，鼹鼠的情绪缓过来了。当两只松鸡互相唧喳嘲笑他那副狼狈相时，他竟能和他们顶起嘴来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour, and planted the Mole in an arm-chair in front of it, having fetched down a dressing-gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till supper-time. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an earth-dwelling animal like Mole. Stories about weirs, and sudden floods, and leaping pike, and steamers that flung hard bottles-at least bottles were certainly flung, and FROM steamers, so presumably BY them; and about herons, and how particular they were whom they spoke to; and about adventures down drains, and night-fishings with Otter, or excursions far a-field with Badger. Supper was a most cheerful meal; but very shortly afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted upstairs by his considerate host, to the best bedroom, where he soon laid his head on his pillow in great peace and contentment, knowing that his new-found friend the River was lapping the sill of his window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到家，河鼠在客厅里升起一炉熊熊的火，给鼹鼠拿来一件晨衣，一双拖鞋，把他安顿在炉前一张扶手椅上，然后给他讲河上的种种趣闻轶事，直到吃晚饭。鼹鼠是一只陆上动物，河上的故事在他听来是十分惊险有趣的。河鼠讲到拦河坝；讲到突发的山洪；讲到跳跃的狗鱼；还有乱扔硬梆梆的瓶子的汽船——扔瓶子是确有其事，而且是由汽船那边扔下来的，因此可以推断，是汽船扔的——还有苍鹭，他们跟别人说话时盛气凌人；还有钻进排水阴沟的探险；还有同水獭一道夜间捉鱼，或者跟獾一道在田野里远足。晚饭吃得痛快极了，可是饭后不多会儿鼹鼠就瞌睡得不行，于是殷勤周到的主人只好把他送到楼上一间讲究的卧室里。鼹鼠马上一头倒住枕头上，感到非常安宁和满意。他知道，他的那位新结识的朋友——大河——在不断轻轻拍打着他的窗棂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated Mole, each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer moved onward. He learnt to swim and to row, and entered into the joy of running water; and with his ear to the reed-stems he caught, at intervals, something of what the wind went whispering so constantly among them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于新从地下居室解放出来的鼹鼠，这一天，只是一连串相伴的日子的开端。随着万物生长成熟的盛夏的来临，白昼一天比一天长，也一天比一天过得更有趣。他学会了游泳，划船，尝到了与流水嬉戏的甜头。他把耳朵贴近芦苇杆时，有时会偷听到风在芦苇丛里的窃窃私语。">查看中文翻译</div>
