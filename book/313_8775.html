<div class="line_en">"Surely," said he with something of the air of a clinical- professor expounding to his class. "Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place, how did these folk come and how did they go? The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?" He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while but addressing them to himself rather than to me. "Window is snibbed on the inner side. Frame-work is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy-mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, Watson," said Holmes, rubbing his hands, "we have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of overconfidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，沃森，”福尔摩斯搓着手说，“我们现在还有半个钟头。让我们好好利用。如我所说，这个案子几乎已经清楚了，但我们不能过于自信，以免出错。案情看起来似乎很简单，但里面还有一些玄奥的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is not a foot-mark," said I.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不是一个脚印。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is the wooden-legged man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是那个装有木腿的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看了看那个很清晰的圆圆的泥印。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite so. But there has been someone else -- a very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, Doctor?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错。可还有另外一个人——一个非常灵活、能干的同伙。你能从那面墙爬过来吗，医生？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is absolutely impossible," I answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“完全是不可能。”我回答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with a broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是对我们很有价值的东西。这是木桩的印记。你看窗台上的靴子印，是一只后跟镶着宽铁掌的厚靴子，旁边是木桩的印记。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active man, you might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point, it may be noted," he continued, fingering the rope, "that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hands."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有协助是不可能的。不过，假若这里有你的朋友，用放在屋角的那条粗绳子，一头系在墙上的这个大钩子上，另一头放给你。我想，只要你是一个有力气的人，就算是装着木腿，你也可以顺着绳子爬上来。下去的时候也一样，你的朋友会收起绳子，从钩子上取下来，关上窗户，从里面锁好，然后用他最初来时使用的方法离开。还有一个值得注意的细节，”他指着那根绳子，继续说道，“那就是，我们的木腿朋友尽管是一个不错的攀登者，但却不是一个职业水手。他的手一点儿也不粗糙。我的放大镜发现了不止一处血迹，尤其是绳子的底部，由此我断定，他是顺着绳子滑下来的，速度太快，以至于把手都磨破了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brickwork.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从敞开的窗户望出去。月光依旧从那个角度照射进来。我们在距离地面六十英尺的地方，墙上连一个能搭脚的砖块缝隙都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is all very well," said I; "but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he into the room?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这都很对，”我说，“不过，有一件事情比什么都难以理解。那个神秘的同伙是怎样的一个人呢？他是怎样进的房间呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, the ally!" repeated Holmes pensively. "There are features of interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country -- though parallel cases suggest themselves from India and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，那个同伙！”福尔摩斯沉思着重复道，“这名同伙有一些很有趣的特征。他把这个案子变得很不平凡。我想这个同谋在我国的犯罪历史上又开辟了一条新路子——尽管在印度有过先例，如果我没有记错，在塞内冈比亚也曾有过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How came he, then?" I reiterated. "The door is locked; the window is inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那他到底是怎么进来的呢？”我追问道，“门是锁着的；窗户也不可能进得来。难道是从烟囱进来的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The grate is much too small," he answered. "I had already considered that possibility."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个壁炉太小了，”他回答，“我考虑过这种可能性了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How, then?" I persisted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么到底怎样进来的呢？”我坚持问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will not apply my precept," he said, shaking his head. "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. When, then, did he come?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你就是不愿运用我教你的方法，”他摇着头说，“我跟你讲过多少次了，当你排除了不可能的方面之后，剩下的，就算再不可置信，也一定会是真相。我们都知道，他不可能从门进来，也不可能从窗户或是烟囱进来。我们也知道，他不可能藏在房间里，因为这里根本没有任何藏身之处。那么，他到底是什么时候进来的呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath and plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们所在的小屋大概长十英尺，宽六英尺。地板是由椽木构成的，中间铺了一些薄板条，敷了一层灰泥，我们走在里面，得从一根椽木踩到另一根上面去。屋顶呈尖形，也就是这所房子真正的屋顶的内壳。这里没有任何家具，长年累月的灰尘在地板上堆出厚厚一层。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above -- the secret room in which the treasure was found."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他当然是的。他一定是这么做的。如果你能帮我拿着灯，我们就能到上面的屋子里去查探看看——那个发现了宝藏的密室。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here you are, you see," said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against the sloping wall. "This is a trap door which leads out on to the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see if we can find some other traces of his individuality?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是了，你看，”舍洛克·福尔摩斯说道，用手扶着那面斜墙。“这就是一个向外通往屋顶的暗门。我用点儿劲儿就能把这个暗门打开，外面就是坡度不大的屋顶。这就是第一个人进来的路。咱们找一找，看他有没有留下什么显示个人信息的痕迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他爬上了梯子，两手按住椽木，翻身上了顶楼。他俯下身来，把灯接过去，我随后也上去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face. For myself, as I followed his gaze, my skin was cold under my clothes. The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot -- clear, well-defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把灯靠近地面，然后脸上露出了今晚第二次的震惊的表情。至于我，随着他的目光看过去，我霎时浑身冰凉。地板布满了光脚留下的印子——清楚且边缘清晰，形状完好，不过几乎不到常人的一半大小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He whipped out his lens and a tape measure and hurried about the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained bloodhound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exerting them in its defence. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿出他的放大镜和皮尺，跪着在房间里快速地四处测量、比较、检查，他那细长的鼻子离地只有几英寸，他那圆溜溜的眼睛炯炯有神，就像鸟眼一般深邃。他的动作敏捷、无声、隐秘，真像一只熟练的猎犬在找寻气味，我不禁联想到：如果他把精力和聪明不用于维护法律，而是去触犯法律的话，他会变成一个多么可怕的罪犯啊！他一面勘查，一面自言自语，最后终于发出一阵响亮的欢呼声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We are certainly in luck," said he. "We ought to have very little trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, you see, and the stuff has leaked out."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我小心翼翼地拿起那根刺，对准了灯。那是一根很长、很尖利的黑刺，刺尖周围有一层半透明的东西，似乎是涂过什么黏液，然后又干了。粗钝的底部是用刀修整削圆了的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“锁好了的，不过，窗台上有脚印。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后，死者贴心地站起来，把门从里面反锁起来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That's common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times. -- Just step outside, Sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend can remain. -- What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure? How's that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，好吧，如果窗是锁好的，那么脚印就跟本案无关了。这是常识。这个人也许是突发死亡，不过财宝随后就丢失了。哈！我有一套推理了。我总是时不时灵光乍现。——先到外面去呆一会儿吧，警官，还有你，肖尔托先生。你的朋友可以留下。——你是怎么看的，福尔摩斯？肖尔托跟我们坦白了，他昨晚跟他哥哥在一起。他哥哥突发死亡，随后肖尔托拿走了财宝？这个想法如何？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hum! There's a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter. This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother; there was a quarrel: so much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. His appearance is -- well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯！这里有一个缺陷。让我们在这个案子里运用一些常识。这个塞迪厄斯·肖尔托和他哥哥在一起，然后有了一场争吵，这是我们所知道的情况。然后，他哥哥死了，财宝也没了。这是我们知道的情况。没有人在塞迪厄斯离开后见过他哥哥。他的床铺也没有睡过的痕迹。塞迪厄斯明显非常困扰。他的表情——恩，不怎么好看。你可以看出，我正在从四面八方包围塞迪厄斯。这张网已经开始收口了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He can find something," remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders; "he has occasional glimmerings of reason. Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他会找到一些东西的，”福尔摩斯耸了耸肩，说道，“他有时也有一些模糊的逻辑思维。用法国人的话来说就是：最难以相处的是有思想的蠢人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are not quite in possession of the facts yet," said Holmes. "This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table, and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你目前还没有掌握足够的事实，”福尔摩斯说，“这根木刺，我有理由认为它有毒，它是从死者的头皮上拿下来的，你还可以看到伤口；这张卡片，你可以看到，上面写了一些东西，旁边放着一根顶上嵌着石头的奇怪木棒。你认为这些要怎么用你的推理解释呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Confirms it in every respect," said the fat detective pompously. "House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus -- a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“各方面都能证实我的推理，”胖侦探神气活现地说道，“这房子里满是印度古玩。塞迪厄斯把这个拿了上来，如果木刺是有毒的，那么，塞迪厄斯和任何人一样，都可以把这个拿来做凶器。这张卡片不过是一种欺骗的把戏罢了——障眼法，可有可无。唯一的问题是，他是怎么离开的呢？啊，果然，屋顶有一个洞。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trapdoor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他虽然块头大，但还是相当灵活地爬上了梯子，挤进了顶楼，然后，我们就听到他兴高采烈地欢呼，说他找到了通向屋顶的暗门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see!" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again; "facts are better than theories, after all. My view of the case is confirmed. There is a trapdoor communicating with the roof, and it is partly open."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看看！”阿塞尔纳·琼斯一边从梯子上下来，一边说，“事实果然比分析推理更有说服力。我关于这个案件的观点已经被证实了。那儿有一扇通往屋顶的暗门，现在半开着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?" He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. "Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. Inspector!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," from the passage. "Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.-- Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest you in the Queen's name as being concerned in the death of your brother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在，长官！”声音从甬道中传来。“让肖尔托先生进来——肖尔托先生，我有责任提醒你，你所说的一切都可能成为对你不利的证据。我以女王的名义逮捕你，因为你和你哥哥的死有关。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There, now! Didn't I tell you!" cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands and looking from one to the other of us.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah! the other man?"asked Athelney Jones in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other's manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！另一个人？”阿塞尔纳·琼斯用不屑的语气问道，但我很容易就能看出，他已经对福尔摩斯关于前一个人的精确描述诧异不已了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is a rather curious person," said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel. "I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them. A word with you, Watson."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一个很奇怪的人，”舍洛克·福尔摩斯转过身来说道，“我希望，不久以后，我就能把这两个人介绍给你。跟你说句话，沃森。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不仅会为他洗脱罪名，琼斯先生，还会免费赠予您一件礼物，那就是昨晚在这个房间里的两个人之中的一个人的名字和特征。他的名字，我完全有理由相信，是乔纳森·斯莫尔。他是一个没受过什么教育的人，矮小而灵活，没有右腿，戴着一支木腿，木腿内侧已经磨去了一块。他的左靴子是粗糙的方形鞋底，后跟上钉着铁掌。他是一个中年男人，皮肤晒得黝黑，从前是一个囚犯。这些指示或许会对你有所帮助，还有，他的手掌磨破了不少皮。而另一个人呢——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This unexpected occurrence," he said, "has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这件意料之外的事情，”他说，“使我们已经背离了这趟行程的初衷。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"By no means. I don't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点儿也不。在更多地了解这件奇异的案子之前，我想我没法休息好。我也曾经历过艰险困苦，可是说实话，今天晚上这一系列的怪事，着实让我胆战心惊。然而，事情已经到了现在这个阶段，我愿意陪同你，把案子彻底解决。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have just been thinking so," I answered; "it is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也正这么想着，”我回答，“摩斯坦小姐不该在这所发生惨案的房子里等这么久。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your presence will be of great service to me," he answered. "We shall work the case out independently and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct. When you have dropped Miss Morstan, I wish you to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the water's edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer's; Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up and tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的在场对我来说是一个很大的帮助，”他回答，“我们应该独立完成这个案子，这个琼斯愿意怎样干，就干他的去吧。你送摩斯坦小姐回去以后，请你到河边兰贝斯区宾奇三号去一趟。右边的第三个房子里住着一个做鸟类标本的人，名叫舍曼。”你可以看到他的窗上画着一只鼬鼠抓着一只小兔子。把老舍曼叫起来，告诉他我向他问好，并想借托比用一用。请你带托比一同坐车来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
