<div class="line_en">Eugene was loose now in the limitless meadows of sensation: his sensory equipment was so complete that at the moment of perception of a single thing, the whole background of color, warmth, odor, sound, taste established itself, so that later, the breath of hot dandelion brought back the grass-warm banks of Spring, a day, a place, the rustling of young leaves, or the page of a book, the thin exotic smell of tangerine, the wintry bite of great apples; or, as with Gulliver's Travels, a bright windy day in March, the spurting moments of warmth, the drip and reek of the earth-thaw, the feel of the fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had won his first release from the fences of home -- he was not quite six, when, of his own insistence, he went to school. Eliza did not want him to go, but his only close companion, Max Isaacs, a year his senior, was going, and there was in his heart a constricting terror that he would be left alone again. She told him he could not go: she felt, somehow, that school began the slow, the final loosening of the cords that held them together, but as she saw him slide craftily out the gate one morning in September and run at top speed to the corner where the other little boy was waiting, she did nothing to bring him back. Something taut snapped in her; she remembered his furtive backward glance, and she wept. And she did not weep for herself, but for him: the hour after his birth she had looked in his dark eyes and had seen something that would brood there eternally, she knew, unfathomable wells of remote and intangible loneliness: she knew that in her dark and sorrowful womb a stranger had come to life, fed by the lost communications of eternity, his own ghost, haunter of his own house, lonely to himself and to the world. O lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他第一次挣脱家庭樊笼的企图已经获得了胜利——他还不足6岁，但由于他固执己见，终于可以上学去了。其实，伊丽莎并不想让他去，但是他唯一的好伙伴、比他大一岁的迈克斯·艾萨克要去上学了，所以他暗自担心自己一个人的时候会很孤单。她不同意他的要求：不知什么原因，她觉得学校会使那根维系母子情感的纽带慢慢地松开直至散开。可是，9月的某一天早晨，当她看见他狡猾地溜出大门，拼命地跑到街角，并同等候在那里的小伙伴会合时，她却没有拉他回来。她紧绷的心弦一下子断了，她想起他一边奔跑一边回首张望的模样，眼泪滚滚而出。她倒不是为自己哭泣，而是为了儿子：就在他刚刚出生的那一刻，她从他那双黑色的眼睛里看到了一种永远都摆脱不掉的阴云。她的心里明白，那是两眼深不可测、遥远的孤独之井。她知道，自己黑暗的腹腔里孕育了一个陌生人。他这一生是一个无家可归的魂灵，永远找不到自己，也找不到世界。啊，失落的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Busy with the ache of their own growing pains, his brothers and sisters had little time for him: he was almost six years younger than Luke, the youngest of them, but they exerted over him the occasional small cruelties, petty tormentings by elder children of a younger, interested and excited by the brief screaming insanity of his temper when, goaded and taunted from some deep dream, he would seize a carving knife and pursue them, or batter his head against the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哥哥姐姐们都忙着应付各自成长过程中遇到的烦恼，根本没有时间照顾他。他比最小的哥哥卢克还小六岁。但是他们却不时地捉弄他、欺负他。当他被刺激和奚落得忍无可忍时，便会尖声地大叫起来，而这时候他们反倒更加开心、更加兴奋。而他却好像在睡梦里受到了辱骂，会怒不可遏地拿起一把切菜刀去追赶他们，或者使劲地往墙上撞自己的脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They felt that he was "queer"-- the other boys preached the smug cowardice of the child-herd, defending themselves, when their persecutions were discovered, by saying they would make a "real boy" of him. But there grew up in him a deep affection for Ben who stalked occasionally and softly through the house, guarding even then with scowling eyes, and surly speech, the secret life. Ben was a stranger: some deep instinct drew him to his child-brother, a portion of his small earnings as a paper-carrier he spent in gifts and amusement for Eugene, admonishing him sullenly, cuffing him occasionally, but defending him before the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都觉得他特别“古怪”——别的孩子们都有一种从众心理，而且得意扬扬地教训他听话。每次当人们发现他们的恶作剧时，他们都会辩解说自己想把他调教成真正的男子汉。但是他对本恩却有着特别深厚的情感，因为本恩有时候会轻手轻脚地在屋子里走动，小小年纪就会愁容满面地望着你，言语十分粗暴，想要把内心的秘密掩盖起来。本恩也是一位陌生人，正是某种深层的默契将他和最小的弟弟拉在一起。他卖报赚了钱总会给尤金买礼物或者带他到外面玩。当然，他也会板着脸教训他，有时候甚至还会打他，但是在别人面前他总会护着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gant, as he watched his brooding face set for hours before a firelit book of pictures, concluded that the boy liked books, more vaguely, that he would make a lawyer of him, send him into politics, see him elected to the governorship, the Senate, the presidency. And he unfolded to him time after time all the rude American legendry of the country boys who became great men because they were country boys, poor boys, and hard-working farm boys. But Eliza thought of him as a scholar, a learned man, a professor, and with that convenient afterthought that annoyed Gant so deeply, but by which she firmly convinced herself, she saw in this book-brooder the fruit of her own deliberate design.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘特看着他这个小儿子面容沉思地凑在炉火前看图画书，一看就是几个小时，于是下结论认为这个孩子酷爱读书。与此同时，在他的意识里有了一个念头，他想让他去做律师，然后进入政界，看着他当选州长、当上参议员，甚至当上总统。所以他一遍又一遍地给儿子讲述那些农村孩子怎样变成伟大人物的传奇故事，说他们之所以成为伟人就是因为他们都来自农村，都是穷人家的孩子，都是一些吃苦耐劳的孩子。但是伊丽莎却认为他将来一定会成为有文化的人，会成为学者、教授。而她坚信，这样一个书呆子完全是由她精心设计、一手栽培起来的。而她的这个想法把甘特气得发疯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus, pent in his dark soul, Eugene sat brooding on a fire-lit book, a stranger in a noisy inn. The gates of his life were closing him in from their knowledge, a vast aerial world of fantasy was erecting its fuming and insubstantial fabric. He steeped his soul in streaming imagery, rifling the book-shelves for pictures and finding there such treasures as With Stanley in Africa, rich in the mystery of the jungle, alive with combat, black battle, the hurled spear, vast snake-rooted forests, thatched villages, gold and ivory; or Stoddard's Lectures, on whose slick heavy pages were stamped the most-visited scenes of Europe and Asia; a Book of Wonder, with enchanting drawings of all the marvels of the age -- Santos Dumont and his balloon, liquid air poured from a kettle, all the navies of the earth lifted two feet from the water by an ounce of radium (Sir William Crookes), the building of the Eiffel Tower, the Flatiron Building, the stick-steered automobile, the submarine. After the earthquake in San Francisco there was a book describing it, its cheap green cover lurid with crumbling towers, shaken spires, toppling many-storied houses plunging into the splitting flame-jawed earth. And there was another called Palaces of Sin, or The Devil in Society, purporting to be the work of a pious millionaire, who had drained his vast fortune in exposing the painted sores that blemish the spotless-seeming hide of great position, and there were enticing pictures showing the author walking in a silk hat down a street full of magnificent palaces of sin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这样的氛围里，尤金把自己封闭在灵魂的深处。每天只知道坐在炉子前面认真地读书，就像旅店里陌生的房客一样。他生活的大门把他关在门背后，不让别人知道，他把自己封闭在一个虚幻缥缈的世界中。他的整个灵魂徜徉在想象的洪流中，他在书架之间仔细地搜寻，寻找图片，寻找宝藏。比如《斯坦利在非洲》一书就弥漫着非洲森林的神秘气息。其中有人与兽生死相搏、空中矛枪翻飞的场面。此外还有巨蛇出没的森林，有茅棚错落的村落，还有黄金和象牙。还有斯托达德的《演讲集》，书中一页一页光滑而沉重的纸张上印着欧亚两洲的美丽景色。《奇观大全》一书展现了当代各种神奇事物的美妙图画，桑托斯·杜蒙乘气球旅行、从壶中倒出的液态气、一盎司的镭可以将全世界所有的海军抛到空中两英尺高（根据威廉·克鲁克斯）、埃菲尔铁塔的建造、纽约的熨斗大厦、操纵杆传动汽车、潜水艇。旧金山大地震之后出版了一本书，专门讲述这场地震的真实情况。浅绿色的封面上印着倒塌的大厦、摇摇欲坠的尖顶、高层大楼倒塌在燃烧的废墟里。还有一本书的名字叫作《罪恶宫殿》，或者叫作《现世的罪恶》，据说是一位笃信宗教的百万富翁写成的。他把赚来的钱全都用于揭露玷污完美无缺外衣的污秽之事上。书中有许多引人入胜的图片，作者本人头戴一顶丝绸礼帽，大步走在两边都是罪恶宫殿的街道上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered yet the East India Tea House at the Fair, the sandalwood, the turbans, and the robes, the cool interior and the smell of India tea; and he had felt now the nostalgic thrill of dew-wet mornings in Spring, the cherry scent, the cool clarion earth, the wet loaminess of the garden, the pungent breakfast smells and the floating snow of blossoms. He knew the inchoate sharp excitement of hot dandelions in young Spring grass at noon; the smell of cellars, cobwebs, and built-on secret earth; in July, of watermelons bedded in sweet hay, inside a farmer's covered wagon; of cantaloupe and crated peaches; and the scent of orange rind, bittersweet, before a fire of coals. He knew the good male smell of his father's sitting-room; of the smooth worn leather sofa, with the gaping horse-hair rent; of the blistered varnished wood upon the hearth; of the heated calf-skin bindings; of the flat moist plug of apple tobacco, stuck with a red flag; of wood-smoke and burnt leaves in October; of the brown tired autumn earth; of honey-suckle at night; of warm nasturtiums; of a clean ruddy farmer who comes weekly with printed butter, eggs and milk; of fat limp underdone bacon and of coffee; of a bakery-oven in the wind; of large deep-hued stringbeans smoking-hot and seasoned well with salt and butter; of a room of old pine boards in which books and carpets have been stored, long closed; of Concord grapes in their long white baskets.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had heard already the ringing of remote church bells over a countryside on Sunday night; had listened to the earth steeped in the brooding of dark, and the million-noted little night things; and he had heard thus the far retreating wail of a whistle in a distant valley, and faint thunder on the rails; and he felt the infinite depth and width of the golden world in the brief seductions of a thousand multiplex and mixed mysterious odors and sensations, weaving, with a blinding interplay and aural explosions, one into the other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Out of this strange jumbled gallery of pictures the pieced-out world was expanding under the brooding power of his imagination: the lost dark angels of the Doré "Milton" swooped into cavernous Hell beyond this upper earth of soaring or toppling spires, machine wonder, maced and mailed romance. And, as he thought of his future liberation into this epic world, where all the color of life blazed brightest far away from home, his heart flooded his face with lakes of blood.</div>

The ragged spume and wrack of fantasy and the lost world still floated from time to time through his clear school-day morning brain, and although he followed accurately all the other instruction of his teacher, he was walled in his ancient unknowing world when they made letters. The children made their sprawling alphabets below a line of models, but all he accomplished was a line of jagged wavering spear-points on his sheet, which he repeated endlessly and rapturously, unable to see or understand the difference.</div>

Still midget-near the live pelt of the earth, he saw many things that he kept in fearful secret, knowing that revelation would be punished with ridicule. One Saturday in Spring, he stopped with Max Isaacs above a deep pit in Central Avenue where city workmen were patching a broken watermain. The clay walls of their pit were much higher than their heads; behind their huddled backs there was a wide fissure, a window in the earth which opened on some dark subterranean passage. And as the boys looked, they gripped each other suddenly, for past the fissure slid the flat head of an enormous serpent; passed, and was followed by a scaled body as thick as a man's; the monster slid endlessly on into the deep earth and vanished behind the working and unwitting men. Shaken with fear they went away, they talked about it then and later in hushed voices, but they never revealed it.</div>

Eliza had allowed his hair to grow long; she wound it around her finger every morning into fat Fauntleroy curls; the agony and humiliation it caused him was horrible, but she was unable or unwilling to understand it, and mouth-pursingly thoughtful and stubborn to all solicitation to cut it. She had the garnered curls of Ben, Grover, and Luke stored in tiny boxes: she wept sometimes when she saw Eugene's, they were the symbol of his babyhood to her, and her sad heart, so keen in marking departures, refused to surrender them.

Gant bought him wagons, sleds, drums, horns -- best of all, a small fireman's ladder wagon: it was the wonder, and finally the curse, of the neighborhood. During his unoccupied hours, he lived for months in the cellar with Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs: they strung the ladders on wires above the wagon, so that, at a touch, they would fall in accurate stacks. They would pretend to doze in their quarters, as firemen do, would leap to action suddenly, as one of them imitated the warning bell: "Clang-a-lang-a-lang." Then, quite beyond reason, Harry and Max yoked in a plunging team, Eugene in the driver's seat, they would leap out through the narrow door, gallop perilously to a neighbor's house, throw up ladders, open windows, effect entries, extinguish imaginary flames, and return oblivious to the shrieking indictment of the housewife.</div>

The firemen loved to stage the most daring exhibitions before the gaping citizenry; helmeted magnificently, they hung from the wagons in gymnastic postures, one man holding another over rushing space, while number two caught in mid-air the diving heavy body of the Swiss, who deliberately risked his neck as he leaped for the rail.

There was a girl named Bessie Barnes, a black-haired, tall, bold-figured girl of thirteen years who acted as model. Otto Krause was fourteen, Eugene was eight: they were in the third grade. The German boy sat next to him, drew obscenities on his books, and passed his furtive scrawled indecencies across the aisle to Bessie.</div>

His desk was stuffed with tiny crumpled balls of writing: one day, during the geography lesson, the woman caught him. His bones turned to rubber as she bore down on him glaring, and took from the concealing pages of his book the paper on which he had been writing. At recess she cleared his desk, read the sequence, and, with boding quietness, bade him to see the principal after school.</div>
