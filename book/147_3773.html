He was the complete male in miniature, the tiny acorn from which the mighty oak must grow, the heir of all ages, the inheritor of unfulfilled renown, the child of progress, the darling of the budding Golden Age and, what's more, Fortune and her Fairies, not content with well-nigh smothering him with these blessings of time and family, saved him up carefully until Progress was rotten-ripe with glory.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, what was going on in Japan? I will tell you: the first parliament met in 1891, there was a war with China in 1894-95, Formosa was ceded in 1895. Moreover, Warren Hastings had been impeached and tried; Pope Sixtus the Fifth had come and gone; Dalmatia had been subdued by Tiberius; Belisarius had been blinded by Justinian; the wedding and funeral ceremonies of Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach and King George the Second had been solemnized, while those of Berengaria of Navarre to King Richard the First were hardly more than a distant memory; Diocletian, Charles the Fifth, and Victor Amadeus of Sardinia, had all abdicated their thrones; Henry James Pye, Poet Laureate of England, was with his fathers; Cassiodorus, Quintilian, Juvenal, Lucretius, Martial, and Albert the Bear of Brandenburg had answered the last great roll-call; the battles of Antietam, Smolensko, Drumclog, Inkerman, Marengo, Cawnpore, Killiecrankie, Sluys, Actium, Lepanto, Tewkesbury, Brandywine, Hohenlinden, Salamis, and the Wilderness had been fought both by land and by sea; Hippias had been expelled from Athens by the Alcæmonidæ and the Lacedæmonians; Simonides, Menander, Strabo, Moschus, and Pindar had closed their earthly accounts; the beatified Eusebius, Athanasius, and Chrysostom had gone to their celestial niches; Menkaura had built the Third Pyramid; Aspalta had led victorious armies; the remote Bermudas, Malta, and the Windward Isles had been colonized. In addition, the Spanish Armada had been defeated; President Abraham Lincoln assassinated, and the Halifax Fisheries Award had given $5,500,000 to Britain for twelve-year fishing privileges. Finally, only thirty or forty million years before, our earliest ancestors had crawled out of the primeval slime; and then, no doubt, finding the change unpleasant, crawled back in again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么这一段时期日本发生什么事了？听我慢慢讲来：1891年召开了第一届议会，1894至1895年中日战争爆发，1895年台湾被割让给日本。不但如此，华伦·海斯汀斯受到指控并被判刑；教皇希斯特斯五世登基又退位；达尔马提亚被提比略征服；贝里塞里亚斯被约斯汀尼恩害瞎了眼；乔治二世与威廉敏娜·卡罗琳的婚礼与葬礼先后举行；而理查一世与皇后几乎成了遥远的历史；地奥克利提安、查理五世、萨丁尼亚的国王维克多·阿玛德等人都先后退位；英格兰桂冠诗人亨利·詹姆斯·派伊早已谢世，卡西奥都拉斯、昆提利莲、朱维纳尔、卢克莱修、马西尔以及外号狗熊的勃兰登堡王阿尔伯也都撒手西去了；安梯塔姆、司莫连斯哥、德鲁姆克洛、尹克曼、马兰哥、孔坡尔、吉利克兰基、司莱斯、阿克西姆、里潘托、图克斯伯里、布兰德维恩、霍亨林登、萨拉米斯以及其他荒野地带都经历过陆海战役的洗礼；希庇亚斯已被阿尔克蒙尼第人和拉西第蒙人赶出了雅典；西蒙尼德斯、米南德、司特拉波、莫淑斯、以及品达等人都已寿终正寝；欧斯比耶斯、阿桑那休斯以及克里索斯托姆都已宣福升天了；蒙克拉建造了第三座金字塔；阿斯帕尔塔统率着他的胜利之师；遥远的百慕大、马耳他和“随风岛”已经变成了殖民地。此外，西班牙大舰队已被打败；林肯总统已被暗杀，“哈利法克斯渔业案”判给英国550万美元作为12年捕鱼权的补偿。最后，不到三四千万年前，我们最早的祖先才从原始的淤泥中爬出来。毫无疑问，当他看到新的环境后并不满意，于是便又掉转方向爬了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lying darkly in his crib, washed, powdered, and fed, he thought quietly of many things before he dropped off to sleep -- the interminable sleep that obliterated time for him, and that gave him a sense of having missed forever a day of sparkling life. At these moments, he was heartsick with weary horror as he thought of the discomfort, weakness, dumbness, the infinite misunderstanding he would have to endure before he gained even physical freedom. He grew sick as he thought of the weary distance before him, the lack of coordination of the centres of control, the undisciplined and rowdy bladder, the helpless exhibition he was forced to give in the company of his sniggering, pawing brothers and sisters, dried, cleaned, revolved before them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗中，他躺在摇篮里，洗过了澡，擦过了粉，喂过了奶，在入睡前，他静静地思考了许多。无休无止的睡眠消耗了他的生命时光，这使他觉得一个明媚的日子就这样永远地逝去了。在这样的时刻，他一想到在自己能够自由地控制身体活动之前还需要忍受长期的不便、困苦、沉默、无休止的误解时，内心就会既厌烦又恐惧。他想到眼前漫长的道路、想到自己对大脑缺乏驾驭的能力、想到任性且不服从指挥的膀胱、想到哥哥姐姐们百般逗弄他，而他却无助地又笑又动，任由他们擦干、清洗、不停地翻来翻去。这时候，他就感到非常难受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was in agony because he was poverty-stricken in symbols: his mind was caught in a net because he had no words to work with. He had not even names for the objects around him: he probably defined them for himself by some jargon, reinforced by some mangling of the speech that roared about him, to which he listened intently day after day, realizing that his first escape must come through language. He indicated as quickly as he could his ravenous hunger for pictures and print: sometimes they brought him great books profusely illustrated, and he bribed them desperately by cooing, shrieking with delight, making extravagant faces, and doing all the other things they understood in him. He wondered savagely how they would feel if they knew what he really thought: at other times he had to laugh at them and at their whole preposterous comedy of errors as they pranced around for his amusement, waggled their heads at him, tickled him roughly, making him squeal violently against his will. The situation was at once profoundly annoying and comic: as he sat in the middle of the floor and watched them enter, seeing the face of each transformed by a foolish leer, and hearing their voices become absurd and sentimental whenever they addressed him, speaking to him words which he did not yet understand, but which he saw they were mangling in the preposterous hope of rendering intelligible that which has been previously mutilated, he had to laugh at the fools, in spite of his vexation.</div>

Lost. He understood that men were forever strangers to one another, that no one ever comes really to know any one, that imprisoned in the dark womb of our mother, we come to life without having seen her face, that we are given to her arms a stranger, and that, caught in that insoluble prison of being, we escape it never, no matter what arms may clasp us, what mouth may kiss us, what heart may warm us.

<div class="line_en">His brain went black with terror. He saw himself an inarticulate stranger, an amusing little clown, to be dandled and nursed by these enormous and remote figures. He had been sent from one mystery into another: somewhere within or without his consciousness he heard a great bell ringing faintly, as if it sounded undersea, and as he listened, the ghost of memory walked through his mind, and for a moment he felt that he had almost recovered what he had lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐怖的黑暗笼罩了他的大脑。他明白自己是个笨嘴笨舌的陌生人，是个滑稽的小丑，是用来让这些巨大而又陌生的身影逗着玩的。他被人从一个神秘的地方送到另一个神秘的地方；在有意无意间他听到了大钟轻微的敲击声，这声音好像来自海底，当他倾听的时候，记忆的精灵轻轻走进他的大脑。一时间，他觉得那些曾经失落的东西几乎又被复原了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes, pulling himself abreast the high walls of his crib, he glanced down dizzily at the patterns of the carpet far below; the world swam in and out of his mind like a tide, now printing its whole sharp picture for an instant, again ebbing out dimly and sleepily, while he pieced the puzzle of sensation together bit by bit, seeing only the dancing fire-sheen on the poker, hearing then the elfin clucking of the sun-warm hens, somewhere beyond in a distant and enchanted world. Again, he heard their morning-wakeful crowing dear and loud, suddenly becoming a substantial and alert citizen of life; or, going and coming in alternate waves of fantasy and fact, he heard the loud, faery thunder of Daisy's parlor music.

<div class="line_en">One day when the opulent Southern Spring had richly unfolded, when the spongy black earth of the yard was covered with sudden, tender grass, and wet blossoms, the great cherry tree seethed slowly with a massive gem of amber sap, and the cherries hung ripening in prodigal clusters, Gant took him from his basket in the sun on the high front porch, and went with him around the house by the lily bed, taking him back under trees singing with hidden birds, to the far end of the lot.</div>

There, he would crawl on the vast design of the carpet, his eyes intent upon great wooden blocks piled chaotically on the floor.

In the warm washed air, Eugene heard with absolute clearness all the brisk backyard sounds of the neighborhood, he became acutely aware of the whole scene, and as Swain's cow sang out again, he felt the flooded gates in him swing open.

<div class="line_en">He passed his second birthday with the light growing. Early in the following Spring he became conscious of a period of neglect: the house was deadly quiet; Gant's voice no longer roared around him, the boys came and went on stealthy feet. Luke, the fourth to be attacked by the pestilence, was desperately ill with typhoid: Eugene was intrusted almost completely to a young slovenly negress. He remembered vividly her tall slattern figure, her slapping lazy feet, her dirty white stockings, and her strong smell, black and funky. One day she took him out on the side porch to play: it was a young Spring morning, bursting moistly from the thaw of the earth. The negress sat upon the side-steps and yawned while he grubbed in his dirty little dress along the path, and upon the lily bed. Presently, she went to sleep against the post. Craftily, he wormed his body through the wide wires of the fence, into the cindered alley that wound back to the Swains', and up to the ornate wooden palace of the Hilliards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的第二个生日过后，生活显得更加灿烂、明亮了。来年春天刚一开始，他就意识到无人看管、被遗忘的孤独感。家里死一般地沉静，甘特的大喊大叫不见了，几位哥哥的出入都神神秘秘的。卢克是第四个染上伤寒疫病的，病得非常重，所以尤金便被托付给一位懒散的黑女人照管。他清楚地记得那个肮脏高大的身影。那个女人长着一双大脚，穿着脏得发黑的白色袜子，身上散发出刺鼻的臭味。有一天，她把他抱到外面的阳台上玩，那是个初春的上午，土地刚刚融化，地上还湿渍渍的。那个黑女人坐在台阶上打着哈欠，而他则穿着脏兮兮的小衣服在小路和百合花坛里抓泥巴玩。很快，那位黑女人便靠着柱子睡着了，他非常灵巧地爬过铁丝网，来到了一条煤渣路上，这条路弯弯曲曲地绕向斯万家，再往前通向希利亚家那座富丽堂皇的木制宫殿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was conscious of sunlight, rain, the leaping fire, his crib, the grim jail of winter: the second Spring, one warm day, he saw Daisy go off to school up the hill: it was the end of the noon recess, she had been home for lunch. She went to Miss Ford's School For Girls; it was a red brick residence on the corner at the top of the steep hill: he watched her join Eleanor Duncan just below. Her hair was braided in two long hanks down her back: she was demure, shy, maidenly, a timid and blushing girl; but he feared her attentions to him, for she bathed him furiously, wreaking whatever was explosive and violent beneath her placidity upon his hide. She really scrubbed him almost raw. He howled piteously. As she climbed the hill, he remembered her. He saw she was the same person.</div>

The house, a huge gabled structure of walnut-brown, which gave the effect of many angles and no plan, was built upon the top of the hill which sloped down to Gant's; the level ground on top before the house was tenanted by lordly towering oaks.

All of their friends arrived by carriage from afar; every day punctually at two o'clock, an old liveried negro drove briskly up the winding alley behind two sleek brown mares, waiting under the carriage entrance at the side until his master and mistress should come out.

<div class="line_en">Now, exactly at three minutes after eleven every morning, so unfailing and perfect was the order of this great establishment, a huge gray horse trotted slowly up the hill, drawing behind him a heavy grocery wagon, musty, spicy, odorous with the fine smells of grocery-stores and occupied exclusively by the Hilliard victuals, and the driver, a young negro man who, at three minutes past eleven every morning, according to ritual, was comfortably asleep. Nothing could possibly go wrong: the horse could not have been tempted even by a pavement of oats to betray his sacred mission. Accordingly he trotted heavily up the hill, turned ponderously into the alley ruts, and advanced heavily until, feeling the great circle of his right forefoot obstructed by some foreign particle, he looked down and slowly removed his hoof from what had recently been the face of a little boy.</div>
