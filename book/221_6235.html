<div class="line_en">Mum had taken up a mug of tea in the morning, and Lou had not stirred. By supper, Mum had become worried and shaken her, checking she was alive. (She can be a bit melodramatic, Mum -- although, to be fair, she had made fish pie and she probably just wanted to make sure Lou wasn't going to miss it.) But Lou wouldn't eat, and she wouldn't talk and she wouldn't come downstairs. I just want to stay here for a bit, Mum, she said, into her pillow. Finally, Mum left her alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Louisa didn't come out of her room for a whole thirty-six hours after she got back from her holiday. She arrived back from the airport late evening on the Sunday, pale as a ghost under her suntan -- and we couldn't work that out for a start, as she had definitely said she'd see us first thing Monday morning. I just need to sleep, she had said, then shut herself in her room and gone straight to bed. We had thought it a little odd, but what did we know? Lou has been peculiar since birth, after all.</div>

Her eyes were tiny and red-rimmed, and her skin, without the tan, would have been even blotchier. Her hair stuck up on one side. She looked like she'd been awake for several years.

<div class="line_en">As we walked past the tourist car park I saw her glance under her brim at the Traynors' house. It stood, elegant and red-brick, its tall blank windows disguising whatever life-changing drama was being played out in there, perhaps even at this moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过游客停车场时，我看见她从帽檐底下瞅了一眼特雷纳家。那栋房子由红砖砌成，相当典雅，高高的假窗掩盖了里面曾上演过的改变人生的戏剧，也许此刻正在上演。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lou ate a piece of toast (she didn't want lunch) and she put on a big floppy sunhat and we walked up to the castle with Thomas to feed the ducks. I don't think she really wanted to go out, but Mum insisted that we all needed some fresh air. This, in my mother's vocabulary, meant she was itching to get into the bedroom and air it and change the bedding. Thomas skipped and hopped ahead of us, clutching a plastic bag full of crusts, and we negotiated the meandering tourists with an ease born of years of practice, ducking out of the way of swinging backpacks, separating around posing couples and rejoining on the other side. The castle baked in the high heat of summer, the ground cracked and the grass wispy, like the last hairs on the head of a balding man. The flowers in the tubs looked defeated, as if they were already half preparing for autumn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露吃了一片烤面包（她不想吃午餐），戴上了一顶大大的松软遮阳帽，我们带着托马斯一起去城堡喂鸭。她不太想出门，但母亲坚持说我们都需要呼吸一些新鲜空气。这，在我母亲的词汇里，意味着她想给卧室通风，更换铺盖。托马斯在前面蹦蹦跳跳，紧抓着一个装满面包皮的塑料袋，我们边走边轻松地闲聊着旅客，这么多年早就见怪不怪了，我们绕开活跃的背包客，经过正在合影留恋的情侣时不得不分散开，然后到另一边重聚。夏天的高温炙烤着城堡，地面开裂，青草稀疏，就像一个秃顶男人头上只留下了最后几根头发。盆里的花蔫蔫的，似乎它们已经准备好过秋天了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We did a slow circuit of the castle, watching Thomas roll down the steep parts of the hill, feeding the ducks that by this stage in the season were so well stuffed they could barely be bothered to come over for mere bread. I watched my sister as we walked, seeing her brown back exposed by her halter-neck top, her stooped shoulders, and I realized that even if she didn't know it yet, everything had changed for her. She wouldn't stay here now, no matter what happened with Will Traynor. She had an air about her, a new air of knowledge, of things seen, places she had been. My sister finally had new horizons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们绕着城堡缓慢转了一圈，看着托马斯从山上陡峭的地方滚下来，我们喂了鸭，这个季节的这个时候，它们被喂得饱饱的，都不屑于过来吃点面包。散步时我一直看着我姐姐，绕颈上衣露出了她棕色的背，她的背有些驼，即使她现在还没有意识到，我却知道对她来说，一切都变了。不管威尔•特雷纳发生了什么，她都不会待在这里了。她有一种气度，对于知识、见到的事物和去过的地方有了新的看法。我姐姐终于有了新的天地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It might sound a bit selfish, but I don't like getting behind with my coursework, and it was a bit of a relief to have a break from Lou's misery. Being around someone that depressed is a bit of a drain. You might feel sorry for them, but you can't help wanting to tell them to pull themselves together too. I shoved my family, my sister, the epic mess she had got herself into, into a mental file, shut the drawer, and focused my attention on VAT exemptions. I got the second-highest marks in my year for Accountancy 1 and there was no way on earth I was dropping back just because of the vagaries of HMRC's flat rate system.</div>

You wouldn't believe the maintenance, apparently. Even the wooden posts at the car park gateway needed replacing every few weeks because the eejits couldn't drive a car through a twelve-foot gap.

<div class="line_en">It was like being under siege. Mum wrung her hands and shouted through the letter box for them to get the hell out of our front garden, whenever one of them ventured past the gate. Thomas gazed out of the upstairs bathroom window and wanted to know why there were people in our garden. Four of our neighbours rang, wanting to know what was going on. Dad parked in Ivy Street and came home via the back garden, and we had a fairly serious talk about castles and boiling oil.</div>

<div class="line_en">I pressed delete on every one. Even those offering money, although I admit I was a teeny bit tempted to see how much they were offering. All the while, I heard Lou talking to Thomas in the bathroom, the whine and splash of him dive-bombing his six inches of soapsuds with the Batmobile. That's the thing you don't know about children unless you have them -- bath time, Lego and fish fingers don't allow you to dwell on tragedy for too long. And then I hit the last message.</div>

<div class="line_en">All but one of the reporters cleared off by half past seven. I didn't know if they had given up, or if Thomas's habit of posting bits of Lego out of the letter box every time they passed another note through had become boring. I told Louisa to bath Thomas for me, mainly because I wanted her to get out of the kitchen, but also because that way I could go through all the messages on our answerphone and delete the newspaper ones while she couldn't hear me. Twenty-six. Twenty-six of the buggers. And all sounding so nice, so understanding. Some of them even offered her money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了一个记者以外，七点半左右，其他人都走了。不知道他们是不是放弃了，又或者是因为每次他们从信箱递过纸条后，托马斯都会弄出去一点乐高的积木，让他们感到厌烦。我让露易莎替我给托马斯洗澡，主要是我想让她离开厨房，也因为我可以趁此机会处理录音电话上的所有留言，把报社的那些删掉，她听不到。二十六个。二十六个浑蛋！听起来都非常和善，非常善解人意，有些甚至愿意给她提供金钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
