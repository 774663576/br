<div class="line_en">The afternoon was lamentable. They could not understand this caprice of the German; and the most singular ideas would come into their heads to trouble them. Everybody staved in the kitchen and discussed the situation endlessly, imagining all sorts of unlikely things. Perhaps they would be retained as hostages -- but to what end?-- or taken prisoners -- or rather a consider-able ransom might be demanded. At this thought a panic prevailed. The richest were the most frightened, al-ready seeing themselves constrained to pay for their lives with sacks of gold poured into the hands of this insolent soldier. They racked their brains to think of some acceptable falsehoods to conceal their riches and make them pass themselves off for poor people, very poor people. Loiseau took off the chain to his watch and hid it away in his pocket. The falling night increased their apprehensions. The lamp was lighted, and as there was still two hours before dinner, Madame Loiseau proposed a game of Thirty-one. It would be a diversion. They accepted. Cornudet himself, having smoked out his pipe, took part for politeness.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they were going to the dinner table, Mr. Follenvie again appeared, and, in wheezing, rattling voice, announced: "The Prussian officer orders me to ask Miss Elizabeth Rousset if she has yet changed her mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正要快去吃饭的时候，伏郎卫先生又露面了，他用那种带着痰响的嗓子高声说道：“普鲁士军官要人来问艾丽萨贝特—鲁西小姐是不是还没有改变她的主意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ball-of-Fat remained standing and was pale; then suddenly becoming crimson, such a stifling anger took possession of her that she could not speak. But finally she flashed out:"You may say to the dirty beast, that idiot, that carrion of a Prussian, that I shall never change it; you understand, never, never, never!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="羊脂球站着不动，脸色是很苍白的；随后突然变成了深红，她因为盛怒而呼吸迫促了，迫促得教她失去了说话的能力。末了她才嚷着说：“您可以告诉这个普鲁士下流东西，这个脏东西，这个死尸，说我永远不愿意，您听清楚，我永远不，永远不，永远不。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Count shuffled the cards, dealt, and Ball-of-Fat had thirty-one at the outset; and immediately the interest was great enough to appease the fear that haunted their minds. Then Cornudet perceived that the house of Loiseau was given to tricks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵洗了牌来分了，羊脂球举手就拿着了三十一点；不久，牌局的兴味压低了种种分心的畏惧。不过戈尔弩兑发现了鸟老板两口子结合着行使欺骗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The great innkeeper went out. Then Ball-of-Fat was immediately surrounded, questioned, and solicited by all to disclose the mystery of his visit. She resisted, at first, but soon becoming exasperated, she said:"What does he want? You really want to know what he wants? He wants to sleep with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胖掌柜出去了。于是羊脂球被人包围了，被人询问了，被人央求了，所有的人都指望她揭穿普鲁士军官请她谈话的秘密。她开初是拒绝说明的；但是没有多久盛怒激动了她，她叫唤道：“他要的？他要的？他要的是和我睡觉！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ladies retired early, and the men, all smoking, organized a game at cards to which Mr. Follenvie was invited, as they intended to put a few casual questions to him on the subject of conquering the resistance of this officer. But he thought of nothing but the cards and, without listening or answering, would keep repeating:"To the game, sirs, to the game. "His attention was so taken that he even forgot to expectorate, which must have put him some points to the good with the organ in his breast. His whistling lungs ran the whole asthmatic scale, from deep, profound tones to the sharp rustiness of a young cock essaying to crow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妇人们是早早退出的，男子们吸着雪茄，一面组织另外一种比较具有赌博性的牌局，邀请了伏郎卫先生参加，他们以为这样就便于巧妙地向掌柜询问怎样去制伏普鲁士军官。不过掌柜只注意自己的牌，什么话也不听，什么话也不回答，反而不断地重复说道：“留心牌哟，先生们，留心牌哟。”他的思虑紧张得连吐痰都忘了，使得痰在胸脯里不时装上了好些延音符。他的肺叶是呼啸的，发得出气喘症的全部音阶，从那些低而深的音符数到小雄鸡勉强啼唱样的尖锐而发哑声音都是无一不备的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everybody was choked for words, and indignation was rife. Cornudet broke his glass, so violently did. he bring his fist down upon the table. There was a clamor of censure against this ignoble soldier, a blast of anger, a union of all for resistance, as if a demand had been made on each one of the party for the sacrifice exacted of her. The Count declared with disgust that those people conducted themselves after the fashion of the ancient barbarians. The women, especially, showed to Ball-of-Fat a most energetic and tender commiseration. The good sisters who only showed themselves at mealtime. lowered their heads and said nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁也不觉得这句话刺耳，因为当时的公愤实在很活跃。戈尔弩兑猛烈地把酒杯向桌上一搁竟打破了它。那是大声斥责这个卑劣丘八的一种公愤，一种怒潮，一种为了抵抗的全体结合，仿佛那丘八向她身上强迫的这种牺牲就是向每一个人要求一部分。伯爵用厌弃的态度声言这些家伙的品行简直像古代的野蛮人。特别是那些妇人对于羊脂球都显示一种有力的和爱抚性的怜惜。两个嬷嬷本来是只在吃饭的时候才出来的，早就低着头什么也没有说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all dined, nevertheless, when the first furore had abated. But there was little conversation; they were thinking.</div>

<div class="line_en">He even refused to retire when his wife, who had fallen asleep previously, came to look for him. She went away alone, for she was an"early bird,"always up with the sun, while her husband was a"night owl,"al-ways ready to pass the night with his friends. He cried out to her:"Leave my creamed chicken before the fire!"and then went on with his game. When they saw that they could get nothing from him, they declared that it was time to stop, and each sought his bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他妻子被瞌睡困住的时候来找他了，他竟至于拒绝上楼去。于是她独自走了，因为她是“干早班的”，素来和太阳一同起身，而她丈夫却是“干晚班的”，素来准备和朋友们熬夜。他这时候向她叫唤：你要把我的蛋黄甜羹搁在火边。”接着又来斗牌了。大家在看见无法从他那里打听到一点消息的时候，就说是应当散了，每一个人都回到了床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alas! the horses remained in the stable and the driver was invisible. For want of better employment, they went out and walked around the carriage.</div>

<div class="line_en">The breakfast was very doleful; and it became apparent that a coldness had arisen toward Ball-of-Fat, and that the night, which brings counsel, had slightly modified their judgments. They almost wished now that the Prussian had secretly found this girl, in order to give her companions a pleasant surprise in the morning. What could be more simple? Besides, who would know anything about it? She could save appearances by telling the officer that she took pity on their distress. To her, it would make so little difference!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午饭是凄惨的，仿佛有一种冷落气氛针对着羊脂球发生了，因为深夜的宁静原是引得起考虑的，它已经略略变更了种种看法。他们现在几乎怨恨这个“姑娘”了：她没有秘密地去找普鲁士人，如果找了，就可以使同伴们一起床都得到一个意外的惊喜。哪儿还有更简单的？并且谁会知道？她只须对军官说自己原是可怜同伴们的悲叹，那就能够敷衍面子了。在她，那原是很不关重要的！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="寒气一天比一天来得重了，像针刺一样严酷地扎着鼻子和耳朵，人的脚变成很痛苦的了，每走一步就要疼一下，后来走到了镇外，田野简直是一片白茫茫的，在他们眼里真凄惨得非常怕人，全体立刻转来了，心灵是冰凉的而心房是紧缩的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the afternoon, as they were almost perishing from ennui, the Count proposed that they take a walk around the village.

<div class="line_cn" title="午后，他们正厌烦得要死，伯爵就提议到镇外的附近各处去兜圈子。每一个人都细心地着了衣裳，于是这个小团体就出发了，只有戈尔弩兑是例外，他宁愿待在火旁边。至于两个嬷嬷，她们的白天时间都是在礼拜堂里或者堂长家里度过的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Loiseau, who understood the situation, asked suddenly if they thought that girl there was going to keep them long in such a place as this.

<div class="line_cn" title="鸟老板是了解情况的。忽然问道这个卖笑女人是否想教他们在这样一种怪地方还待些日子。伯爵始终是文雅的，说旁人不能把一种这样难受的牺牲去强迫一个妇人，而要她出于自愿。迦来－辣马东先生注意于倘若法国军队像大家所怀疑的一样真从吉艾卜开过来反攻，那么只能在多忒接触。这种思虑使得另外两个不安了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly at the end of the street, the officer appeared.
