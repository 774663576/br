<div class="line_en">But why? Sansa wondered when she was alone. It made her uneasy. I'll wager this gown is Margaery's doing somehow, or her grandmother's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么？这到底是为什么？珊莎独处时感到十分疑惑，十分不安。嗯，我敢打赌，多半是玛格丽或她祖母的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Closest to Sansa's own age were the cousins Elinor, Alla, and Megga, Tyrells from junior branches of the House. "Roses from lower on the bush," quipped Elinor, who was witty and willowy. Megga was round and loud, Alla shy and pretty, but Elinor ruled the three by right of womanhood; she was a maiden flowered, whereas Megga and Alla were mere girls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟珊莎年龄相仿的是玛格丽的三位表妹，埃萝、雅兰和梅歌，来自于提利尔家族的偏房分支。“我们是低枝上的玫瑰，”埃萝语带双关地说，她为人机智，体形又苗条。梅歌则又胖又吵，雅兰漂亮而羞涩，由于埃萝已是成年女子，所以在三人中占据统治地位——她有了月事，而梅歌与雅兰不过是小女生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cousins took Sansa into their company as if they had known her all their lives. They spent long afternoons doing needlework and talking over lemon cakes and honeyed wine, played at tiles of an evening, sang together in the castle sept… and often one or two of them would be chosen to share Margaery's bed, where they would whisper half the night away. Alla had a lovely voice, and when coaxed would play the woodharp and sing songs of chivalry and lost loves. Megga couldn't sing, but she was mad to be kissed. She and Alla played a kissing game sometimes, she confessed, but it wasn't the same as kissing a man, much less a king. Sansa wondered what Megga would think about kissing the Hound, as she had. He'd come to her the night of the battle stinking of wine and blood. He kissed me and threatened to kill me, and made me sing him a song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小姑娘欢天喜地拉珊莎入伙，好像大家从小便是伙伴。她们常常整下午做针线，讨论柠檬蛋糕和蜂蜜酒，晚上玩四方瓦片棋，一起在城堡圣堂里唱歌…四人还轮流和玛格丽同床做伴，悄悄话直说到半夜。雅兰嗓子好，只需稍加怂恿，便会弹奏木竖琴，歌颂骑士精神和失落的爱情。梅歌不会唱，但她喜欢亲吻，喜欢得发疯。她承认自己会和雅兰玩接吻游戏，但那和亲吻男人是不同的，更比不上亲吻国王。不知梅歌对我差点与猎狗亲吻怎么看，珊莎心想。他在激战正酣的那个晚上来找她，浑身散发着血和酒的臭味。他要吻我，他想杀我，还要我为他唱歌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Margaery's kindness had been unfailing, and her presence changed everything. Her ladies welcomed Sansa as well. It had been so long since she had enjoyed the company of other women, she had almost forgotten how pleasant it could be. Lady Leonette gave her lessons on the high harp, and Lady Janna shared all the choice gossip. Merry Crane always had an amusing story, and little Lady Bulwer reminded her of Arya, though not so fierce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛格丽是真心对她好，她的存在改变了一切。她的女伴们纷纷乐于和珊莎结交。太久没有其他女伴，她几乎忘记了其中的快乐。莱昂妮夫人教她古竖琴，洁娜夫人同她分享所有的八卦闲话。梅内狄斯·克连恩总有好玩的故事，而幼小的布尔威令她想起艾莉亚，尽管她不及妹妹那么暴躁。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had worn her favor in the Battle of the Blackwater, where he'd slain a Myrish crossbowman and a Mullendore man-atarms. "Alyn said her favor made him fearless," said Megga. "He says he shouted her name for his battle cry, isn't that ever so gallant? Someday I want some champion to wear my favor, and kill a hundred men." Elinor told her to hush, but looked pleased all the same.</div>

<div class="line_en">Margaery was different, though. Sweet and gentle, yet there was a little of her grandmother in her, too. The day before last she'd taken Sansa hawking. It was the first time she had been outside the city since the battle. The dead had been burned or buried, but the Mud Gate was scarred and splintered where Lord Stannis's rams had battered it, and the hulls of smashed ships could be seen along both sides of the Blackwater, charred masts poking from the shallows like gaunt black fingers. The only traffic was the flat-bottomed ferry that took them across the river, and when they reached the kingswood they found a wilderness of ash and charcoal and dead trees. But the waterfowl teemed in the marshes along the bay, and Sansa's merlin brought down three ducks while Margaery's peregrine took a heron in full flight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛格丽不一样。国王的未婚妻纵然甜美温柔，身上却带着一丝她祖母的影子。前天，她领珊莎外出鹰狩，这是战斗之后她第一次出城。尸体已经掩埋或焚毁，但烂泥门仍破破烂烂，伤痕累累，乃是史坦尼斯公爵的攻城锤的杰作。黑水河两岸，布满毁坏断裂的船骸，烤焦的桅杆如憔悴的黑手指，从浅滩上伸出。要想过河，只能坐平底小船。御林也是一片焦土荒凉，好在海湾沿岸的沼地里水禽颇丰，珊莎的灰背隼抓到三只野鸭，玛格丽的隼则在空中打下一只苍鹭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sister. Sansa had once dreamt of having a sister like Margaery; beautiful and gentle, with all the world's graces at her command. Arya had been entirely unsatisfactory as sisters went. How can I let my sister marry Joffrey? she thought, and suddenly her eyes were full of tears. "Margaery, please," she said, "you mustn't." It was hard to get the words out. "You mustn't marry him. He's not like he seems, he's not. He'll hurt you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="姐妹。珊莎梦想过有个玛格丽这样的好姐妹，甜美优雅又善良，和艾莉亚完全不一样。我怎能让我的好姐妹跟乔佛里结婚呢？她想着想着，眼中突然噙满泪水。“玛格丽，求求你，”她道，“一定不要…”这话很难说出口。“…一定不要跟他结婚，他这人表里不一，会…会伤害你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shouldn't think so." Margaery smiled confidently. "It's brave of you to warn me, but you need not fear. Joff's spoiled and vain and I don't doubt that he's as cruel as you say, but Father forced him to name Loras to his Kingsguard before he would agree to the match. I shall have the finest knight in the Seven Kingdoms protecting me night and day, as Prince Aemon protected Naerys. So our little lion had best behave, hadn't he?" She laughed, and said, "Come, sweet sister, let's race back to the river. It will drive our guards quite mad." And without waiting for an answer, she put her heels into her horse and flew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别为我担心，好妹妹。”玛格丽自信地微笑。“你真勇敢，肯来警告我，但请你放心吧，我知道小乔是个被宠坏的孩子，自负又愚蠢，而且跟你说的一样残酷，这些父亲也早料到，所以才会在婚约条款中坚持让洛拉斯成为御林铁卫。你瞧，我有七大王国中最优秀的骑士日夜守护，好比伊蒙王子守护奈丽诗王后，所以咱们的小狮子最好举止恰当，不是吗？”她轻声浅笑，“来吧，亲爱的妹妹，让我们好好跑一段，比赛谁先到河边。噢，这会让侍卫们发狂的。”她不待回答，一夹马肚，飞驰而去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She is so brave, Sansa thought, galloping after her… and yet, her doubts still gnawed at her. Ser Loras was a great knight, all agreed. But Joffrey had other Kingsguard, and gold cloaks and red cloaks besides, and when he was older he would command armies of his own. Aegon the Unworthy had never harmed Queen Naerys, perhaps for fear of their brother the Dragonknight… but when another of his Kingsguard fell in love with one of his mistresses, the king had taken both their heads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她好勇敢啊，珊莎跟在她后面，边骑边想…然而疑虑却没有打消。洛拉斯是个伟大的骑士，大家都知道，可乔佛里有其他的御林铁卫啊，还有金袍卫士和红袍卫士，长大之后会有自己的军队。庸王伊耿不曾伤害奈丽诗王后，或许是因为害怕弟弟龙骑士伊蒙…但当另一位御林铁卫跟他的一个情妇相爱时，国王却要了两人的脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Loras is a Tyrell, Sansa reminded herself. That other knight was only a Toyne. His brothers had no armies, no way to avenge him but with swords. Yet the more she thought about it all, the more she wondered. Joff might restrain himself for a few turns, perhaps as long as a year, but soon or late he will show his claws, and when he does… The realm might have a second Kingslayer, and there would be war inside the city, as the men of the lion and the men of the rose made the gutters run red.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好在洛拉斯爵士是提利尔家的人，珊莎提醒自己，从前那位骑士不过属于托因家族——他的亲戚们没有军队，除非暗杀，否则无法为他复仇。话虽这么说，可她越深入地想下去，就越觉困惑。一年半载，乔佛里或能克制，但时间一长，迟早会露出狐狸尾巴，到时候…说不定会出现第二个弑君者，说不定会有第二场王位战争，狮子和玫瑰将疆场交兵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could never hold a picture of Willas long in her head, though; her imaginings kept turning him back into Ser Loras, young and graceful and beautiful. You must not think of him like that, she told herself. Or else he may see the disappointment in your eyes when you meet, and how could he marry you then, knowing it was his brother you loved? Willas Tyrell was twice her age, she reminded herself constantly, and lame as well, and perhaps even plump and red-faced like his father. But comely or no, he might be the only champion she would ever have.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="惟一的困扰是，她无法将维拉斯的形象长时间保持在头脑中，总将他的面容转化为洛拉斯爵士的脸，年轻、优雅而漂亮。你不该这样想象，她告诫自己，否则等见面时，他也许会发现你眼中的失望呢。如果他知道你爱的是他弟弟，又怎会跟你结婚呢？维拉斯·提利尔的年纪有我两倍大，她不断提醒自己，而且瘸了腿，或许跟他父亲一样肥胖，一样长着红脸孔。但不管生得是否好看，他都是我最好的依靠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps, or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge. If I give him sons, he may come to love me. She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon, and raise them all to be as valiant as Ser Loras. And to hate Lannisters, too. In Sansa's dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想象着他俩坐在花园里，膝头抱着小狗，或乘花船沿曼德河游玩，边听歌手弹奏竖琴。等我给他生个儿子，他就会爱上我的。我要把他们取名为艾德、布兰登和瑞肯，将他们抚养得同洛拉斯爵士一样英武，而且仇恨兰尼斯特。在珊莎梦中，她的孩子看上去跟她失去的兄弟们一样，其中甚至有一个长得像艾莉亚的女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She would wear her new gown for the ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor, she decided as the seamstress took her last measurement. That must be why Cersei is having it made for me, so I will not look shabby at the wedding. She really ought to have a different gown for the feast afterward but she supposed one of her old ones would do. She did not want to risk getting food or wine on the new one. I must take it with me to Highgarden. She wanted to look beautiful for Willas Tyrell. Even if Dontos was right, and it is Winterfell he wants and not me, he still may come to love me for myself. Sansa hugged herself tightly, wondering how long it would be before the gown was ready. She could scarcely wait to wear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女裁缝最后一次替她丈量尺寸时，她决定穿着新裙服去参加贝勒大圣堂的婚礼庆典。瑟曦一定是为这个才命人替我做衣服的，总不能让我破破烂烂地参加婚宴吧！不，不行，穿旧的就可以。我不能冒险，让食物或酒水沾到新裙服上。我要把它带到高庭去，在维拉斯·提利尔面前穿起来。就算唐托斯说得对，他要的是临冬城而不是我本人，我仍然可以让他爱上我。珊莎紧紧抱住自己，一边揣测新裙服做好的时间。她迫不及待想要穿上它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once she dreamed it was still her marrying Joff, not Margaery, and on their wedding night he turned into the headsman Ilyn Payne. She woke trembling. She did not want Margaery to suffer as she had, but she dreaded the thought that the Tyrells might refuse to go ahead with the wedding. I warned her, I did, I told her the truth of him. Perhaps Margaery did not believe her. Joff always played the perfect knight with her, as once he had with Sansa. She will see his true nature soon enough. After the wedding if not before. Sansa decided that she would light a candle to the Mother Above the next time she visited the sept, and ask her to protect Margaery from Joffrey's cruelty. And perhaps a candle to the Warrior as well, for Loras.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一回，她梦见嫁给小乔的仍是自己，并非玛格丽，而在婚礼当晚，国王变成了刽子手伊林·派恩。她颤抖着醒来。她不想玛格丽像自己一样受折磨，但也害怕提利尔家拒绝联姻。反正我警告过她，没错，我把真相对她说了。或许玛格丽是自己不相信。小乔跟她在一起时总扮演英雄的角色，他从前对我也这么做。不过，她很快将认识到他的本性——不是在婚礼之前，而是在婚礼之后。珊莎决定下次造访圣堂时在圣母面前点一支蜡烛，祈求她保护玛格丽，免于乔佛里的伤害。或许再在战士面前再为洛拉斯点一支。">查看中文翻译</div>
