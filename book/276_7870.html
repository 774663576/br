<div class="line_en">When Jobs unveiled the NeXT computer in 1988, there was a burst of excitement. That fizzled when the computer finally went on sale the following year. Jobs's ability to dazzle, intimidate, and spin the press began to fail him, and there was a series of stories on the company's woes. "NeXT is incompatible with other computers at a time when the industry is moving toward interchangeable systems," Bart Ziegler of Associated Press reported. "Because relatively little software exists to run on NeXT, it has a hard time attracting customers."</div>

<div class="line_en">NeXT tried to reposition itself as the leader in a new category, personal workstations, for people who wanted the power of a workstation and the friendliness of a personal computer. But those customers were by now buying them from fast-growing Sun Microsystems. Revenues for NeXT in 1990 were $28 million; Sun made $2.5 billion that year. IBM abandoned its deal to license the NeXT software, so Jobs was forced to do something against his nature: Despite his ingrained belief that hardware and software should be integrally linked, he agreed in January 1992 to license the NeXTSTEP operating system to run on other computers.</div>

<div class="line_en">One surprising defender of Jobs was Jean-Louis Gassee, who had bumped elbows with Jobs when he replaced him at Apple and subsequently been ousted himself. He wrote an article extolling the creativity of NeXT products. "NeXT might not be Apple," Gassee argued, "but Steve is still Steve." A few days later his wife answered a knock on the door and went running upstairs to tell him that Jobs was standing there. He thanked Gassee for the article and invited him to an event where Intel's Andy Grove would join Jobs in announcing that NeXTSTEP would be ported to the IBM/Intel platform. "I sat next to Steve's father, Paul Jobs, a movingly dignified individual," Gassee recalled. "He raised a difficult son, but he was proud and happy to see him onstage with Andy Grove."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔布斯当时一个出乎意料的维护者竟是让—路易·加西，他曾经跟乔布斯在苹果发生摩檫，后来被逐出苹果。他写了一篇文章称赞NeXT产品是多么具有创造性。“NeXT也许不是苹果，”加西说，“但史蒂夫还是史蒂夫。”几天之后，加西家来了一位访客，加西的妻子跑上楼去告诉他，史蒂夫在楼下。乔布斯感谢加西写了那篇文章，并邀请他参加一个活动，届时英特尔的安迪·格鲁夫将和乔布斯一同宣布，NeXTSTEP将被植入IBM/英特尔平台上。“我当时坐在史蒂夫的父亲保罗·乔布斯旁边，他备受尊重。”加西回忆说，“他带大儿子很不容易。看到史蒂夫跟安迪·格鲁夫站在台上，他是那么自豪和高兴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A year later Jobs took the inevitable subsequent step: He gave up making the hardware altogether. This was a painful decision, just as it had been when he gave up making hardware at Pixar. He cared about all aspects of his products, but the hardware was a particular passion. He was energized by great design, obsessed over manufacturing details, and would spend hours watching his robots make his perfect machines. But now he had to lay off more than half his workforce, sell his beloved factory to Canon (which auctioned off the fancy furniture), and satisfy himself with a company that tried to license an operating system to manufacturers of uninspired machines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年以后，乔布斯不可避免地改变了策略；彻底放弃硬件的制造。这是一个痛苦的决定，一如他当年在皮克斯放弃硬件制造那样。他关注产品的方方面面，但硬件才是他的热情所在。他为出色的设计心潮澎湃，痴迷于生产细节，会花上好几个小时注视着他的机器人为他制造完美的产品。但现在，他不得不解雇一半以上的人力，把他钟爱的工厂卖给佳能（佳能拍卖掉了那些时尚的家具），留得一家聊以慰藉的公司，把操作系统授权给那些生产死板机器的制造商。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the mid --1990s Jobs was finding some pleasure in his new family life and his astonishing triumph in the movie business, but he despaired about the personal computer industry. "Innovation has virtually ceased," he told Gary Wolf of Wired at the end of 1995. "Microsoft dominates with very little innovation. Apple lost. The desktop market has entered the dark ages."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到20世纪90年代中期，乔布斯在他新的家庭生活和在电影产业的惊人成功中找到了一些快乐，但是却对个人计算机产业备感失望。“创新实际上已经停止，”1995年底他对《连线》杂志的加里·沃尔夫（Gary Wolf）这样说，“微软占据了市场，但几乎没有创新。苹果输了。台式电脑市场进入了黑暗时代。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was also gloomy in an interview with Tony Perkins and the editors of Red Herring. First, he displayed the "Bad Steve" side of his personality. Soon after Perkins and his colleagues arrived, Jobs slipped out the back door "for a walk," and he didn't return for forty-five minutes. When the magazine's photographer began taking pictures, he snapped at her sarcastically and made her stop. Perkins later noted, "Manipulation, selfishness, or downright rudeness, we couldn't figure out the motivation behind his madness." When he finally settled down for the interview, he said that even the advent of the web would do little to stop Microsoft's domination. "Windows has won," he said. "It beat the Mac, unfortunately, it beat UNIX, it beat OS/2. An inferior product won."</div>

<div class="line_en">For a few years after Jobs was ousted, Apple was able to coast comfortably with a high profit margin based on its temporary dominance in desktop publishing. Feeling like a genius back in 1987, John Sculley had made a series of proclamations that nowadays sound embarrassing. Jobs wanted Apple "to become a wonderful consumer products company," Sculley wrote. "This was a lunatic plan.... Apple would never be a consumer products company.... We couldn't bend reality to all our dreams of changing the world.... High tech could not be designed and sold as a consumer product."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jobs was appalled, and he became angry and contemptuous as Sculley presided over a steady decline in market share for Apple in the early 1990s. "Sculley destroyed Apple by bringing in corrupt people and corrupt values," Jobs later lamented. "They cared about making money-for themselves mainly, and also for Apple-rather than making great products." He felt that Sculley's drive for profits came at the expense of gaining market share. "Macintosh lost to Microsoft because Sculley insisted on milking all the profits he could get rather than improving the product and making it affordable." As a result, the profits eventually disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔布斯格外震惊。20世纪90年代初，苹果在斯卡利的领导下市场份额和收入持续下降，他对斯卡利的愤怒和蔑视也与日俱增。“斯卡利引进下三滥的人和下三滥的价值观，把苹果给毁了。”乔布斯后来悲叹，“他们只在乎如何赚钱——主要为他们自己，同时也为苹果——而不在乎如何制造出色的产品。”乔布斯感觉斯卡利对利润的追逐是以牺性市场份额为代价的。“麦金塔之所以输给微软，是因为斯卡利坚持榨取每一分利润，而不是努力改进产品和降低价格。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His frustration with Apple was evident when he gave a talk to a Stanford Business School club at the home of a student, who asked him to sign a Macintosh keyboard. Jobs agreed to do so if he could remove the keys that had been added to the Mac after he left. He pulled out his car keys and pried off the four arrow cursor keys, which he had once banned, as well as the top row of F1, F2, F3... function keys. "I'm changing the world one keyboard at a time," he deadpanned. Then he signed the mutilated keyboard.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had taken Microsoft a few years to replicate Macintosh's graphical user interface, but by 1990 it had come out with Windows 3.0, which began the company's march to dominance in the desktop market. Windows 95, which was released in 1995, became the most successful operating system ever, and Macintosh sales began to collapse. "Microsoft simply ripped off what other people did," Jobs later said.

<div class="line_en">By 1996 Apple's share of the market had fallen to 4% from a high of 16% in the late 1980s. Michael Spindler, the German-born chief of Apple's European operations who had replaced Sculley as CEO in 1993, tried to sell the company to Sun, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard. That failed, and he was ousted in February 1996 and replaced by Gil Amelio, a research engineer who was CEO of National Semiconductor. During his first year the company lost $1 billion, and the stock price, which had been $70 in 1991, fell to $14, even as the tech bubble was pushing other stocks into the stratosphere.</div>

<div class="line_en">Amelio was not a fan of Jobs. Their first meeting had been in 1994, just after Amelio was elected to the Apple board. Jobs had called him and announced, "I want to come over and see you." Amelio invited him over to his office at National Semiconductor, and he later recalled watching through the glass wall of his office as Jobs arrived. He looked "rather like a boxer, aggressive and elusively graceful, or like an elegant jungle cat ready to spring at its prey." After a few minutes of pleasantries-far more than Jobs usually engaged in-he abruptly announced the reason for his visit. He wanted Amelio to help him return to Apple as the CEO. "There's only one person who can rally the Apple troops," Jobs said, "only one person who can straighten out the company." The Macintosh era had passed, Jobs argued, and it was now time for Apple to create something new that was just as innovative.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the summer of 1996 Amelio realized that he had a serious problem. Apple was pinning its hopes on creating a new operating system, called Copland, but Amelio had discovered soon after becoming CEO that it was a bloated piece of vaporware that would not solve Apple's needs for better networking and memory protection, nor would it be ready to ship as scheduled in 1997.

He said he wanted to bring his fifty-person team to Apple, and he asked for 15% of the company, worth about $500 million. Amelio was stunned. Apple calculated that Be was worth about $50 million. After a few offers and counteroffers, Gassee refused to budge from demanding at least $275 million. He thought that Apple had no alternatives.

Two years earlier Macworld magazine columnist (and former Apple software evangelist) Guy Kawasaki had published a parody press release joking that Apple was buying NeXT and making Jobs its CEO. In the spoof Mike Markkula asked Jobs, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling UNIX with a sugarcoating, or change the world?" Jobs responded, "Because I'm now a father, I needed a steadier source of income." The release noted that "because of his experience at Next, he is expected to bring a newfound sense of humility back to Apple." It also quoted Bill Gates as saying there would now be more innovations from Jobs that Microsoft could copy. Everything in the press release was meant as a joke, of course.

<div class="line_en">For Jobs, the contest against Be was both professional and personal. NeXT was failing, and the prospect of being bought by Apple was a tantalizing lifeline. In addition, Jobs held grudges, sometimes passionately, and Gassee was near the top of his list, despite the fact that they had seemed to reconcile when Jobs was at NeXT. "Gassee is one of the few people in my life I would say is truly horrible," Jobs later insisted, unfairly. "He knifed me in the back in 1985." Sculley, to his credit, had at least been gentlemanly enough to knife Jobs in the front.</div>

<div class="line_en">On December 2, 1996, Steve Jobs set foot on Apple's Cupertino campus for the first time since his ouster eleven years earlier. In the executive conference room, he met Amelio and Hancock to make the pitch for NeXT. Once again he was scribbling on the whiteboard there, this time giving his lecture about the four waves of computer systems that had culminated, at least in his telling, with the launch of NeXT. He was at his most seductive, despite the fact that he was speaking to two people he didn't respect. He was particularly adroit at feigning modesty. "It's probably a totally crazy idea," he said, but if they found it appealing, "I'll structure any kind of deal you want-license the software, sell you the company, whatever." He was, in fact, eager to sell everything, and he pushed that approach. "When you take a close look, you'll decide you want more than my software," he told them. "You'll want to buy the whole company and take all the people."</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks later Jobs and his family went to Hawaii for Christmas vacation. Larry Ellison was also there, as he had been the year before. "You know, Larry, I think I've found a way for me to get back into Apple and get control of it without you having to buy it," Jobs said as they walked along the shore. Ellison recalled, "He explained his strategy, which was getting Apple to buy NeXT, then he would go on the board and be one step away from being CEO." Ellison thought that Jobs was missing a key point. "But Steve, there's one thing I don't understand," he said. "If we don't buy the company, how can we make any money?" It was a reminder of how different their desires were. Jobs put his hand on Ellison's left shoulder, pulled him so close that their noses almost touched, and said, "Larry, this is why it's really important that I'm your friend. You don't need any more money."</div>

<div class="line_en">The big bakeoff between NeXT and Be was held at the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto on December 10, in front of Amelio, Hancock, and six other Apple executives. NeXT went first, with Avie Tevanian demonstrating the software while Jobs displayed his hypnotizing salesmanship. They showed how the software could play four video clips on the screen at once, create multimedia, and link to the Internet. "Steve's sales pitch on the NeXT operating system was dazzling," according to Amelio. "He praised the virtues and strengths as though he were describing a performance of Olivier as Macbeth."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tevanian later said that this was no surprise: "We had better technology, we had a solution that was complete, and we had Steve." Amelio knew that bringing Jobs back into the fold would be a double-edged sword, but the same was true of bringing Gassee back.

<div class="line_en">Jobs invited Amelio to come to his house in Palo Alto so they could negotiate in a friendly setting. When Amelio arrived in his classic 1973 Mercedes, Jobs was impressed; he liked the car. In the kitchen, which had finally been renovated, Jobs put a kettle on for tea, and then they sat at the wooden table in front of the open-hearth pizza oven. The financial part of the negotiations went smoothly; Jobs was eager not to make Gassee's mistake of overreaching. He suggested that Apple pay $12 a share for NeXT. That would amount to about $500 million. Amelio said that was too high. He countered with $10 a share, or just over $400 million. Unlike Be, NeXT had an actual product, real revenues, and a great team, but Jobs was nevertheless pleasantly surprised at that counteroffer. He accepted immediately.</div>

<div class="line_en">One sticking point was that Jobs wanted his payout to be in cash. Amelio insisted that he needed to "have skin in the game" and take the payout in stock that he would agree to hold for at least a year. Jobs resisted. Finally, they compromised: Jobs would take $120 million in cash and $37 million in stock, and he pledged to hold the stock for at least six months.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谈判的一个胶着点，是乔布斯希望苹果付给他现金。阿梅里奥坚持说他应该与公司共存亡，只能付给他股票，而且他要同意持股至少一年。乔布斯不愿意。最后，双方都作出了让步。乔布斯将拿到1。2亿美元的现金和价值3700万美元的股票，并承诺持有这些股票最少6个月。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After circling the long blocks a couple of times, they returned to the house just as Laurene and the kids were arriving home. They all celebrated the easy negotiations, then Amelio rode off in his Mercedes. "He made me feel like a lifelong friend," Amelio recalled. Jobs indeed had a way of doing that. Later, after Jobs had engineered his ouster, Amelio would look back on Jobs's friendliness that day and note wistfully, "As I would painfully discover, it was merely one facet of an extremely complex personality."</div>

Amelio tried to deflect it, saying there was too much history to do something like that too quickly. "Gil, that really hurts," Jobs said. "This was my company. I've been left out since that horrible day with Sculley." Amelio said he understood, but he was not sure what the board would want. When he was about to begin his negotiations with Jobs, he had made a mental note to "move ahead with logic as my drill sergeant" and "sidestep the charisma." But during the walk he, like so many others, was caught in Jobs's force field. "I was hooked in by Steve's energy and enthusiasm," he recalled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Years later, when I raised it with him, Gates did not recall being that upset. The purchase of NeXT, he argued, did not really give Apple a new operating system. "Amelio paid a lot for NeXT, and let's be frank, the NeXT OS was never really used." Instead the purchase ended up bringing in Avie Tevanian, who could help the existing Apple operating system evolve so that it eventually incorporated the kernel of the NeXT technology. Gates knew that the deal was destined to bring Jobs back to power. "But that was a twist of fate," he said. "What they ended up buying was a guy who most people would not have predicted would be a great CEO, because he didn't have much experience at it, but he was a brilliant guy with great design taste and great engineering taste. He suppressed his craziness enough to get himself appointed interim CEO."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年以后，当我向盖茨问起这件事，他已经不记得自己有那么沮丧了。他认为收购NeXT没有真正给苹果带来一个新的操作系统。“阿梅里奥为NeXT支付了一大笔钱，咱们坦率说，NeXTOS系统从来就没有真正使用过。”不过，这次收购倒是让阿维·泰瓦尼安加盟进来，他帮助改进现有的苹果操作系统，并最终融入了NeXT的核心技术。盖茨知道这次交易注定会使乔布斯重掌大权。“但这就是命运无常，”他说，“他们最后买来的是一个大多数人认为不会是个好CEO的人，因为他对此没什么经验，但是他是个才华横溢的家伙，有出色的设计品位和工程品位。他适当地压抑一下自己的疯狂，就被任命为临时CEO了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After informing Gassee that Apple was buying NeXT, Amelio had what turned out to be an even more uncomfortable task: telling Bill Gates. "He went into orbit," Amelio recalled. Gates found it ridiculous, but perhaps not surprising, that Jobs had pulled off this coup. "Do you really think Steve Jobs has anything there?" Gates asked Amelio. "I know his technology, it's nothing but a warmed-over UNIX, and you'll never be able to make it work on your machines." Gates, like Jobs, had a way of working himself up, and he did so now: "Don't you understand that Steve doesn't know anything about technology? He's just a super salesman. I can't believe you're making such a stupid decision.... He doesn't know anything about engineering, and 99% of what he says and thinks is wrong. What the hell are you buying that garbage for?"</div>

Amelio asked. "It's okay if that's what you want." Jobs did not answer; he just stared. "Do you want to be on the payroll? An advisor?" Again Jobs stayed silent. Amelio went out and grabbed Jobs's lawyer, Larry Sonsini, and asked what he thought Jobs wanted. "Beats me," Sonsini said. So Amelio went back behind closed doors with Jobs and gave it one more try. "Steve, what's on your mind? What are you feeling? Please, I need a decision now."</div>

Instead of appearing from the wings of the stage, Jobs walked in from the rear of the auditorium and ambled down the aisle. Amelio had told the gathering that Jobs would be too tired to say anything, but by then he had been energized by the applause. "I'm very excited," Jobs said. "I'm looking forward to get to reknow some old colleagues." Louise Kehoe of the Financial Times came up to the stage afterward and asked Jobs, sounding almost accusatory, whether he was going to end up taking over Apple. "Oh no, Louise," he said.

But the Pixar people were happy to see him go back to Apple part-time; a little less of Jobs's focus would be a good thing. He was useful when there were big negotiations, but he could be dangerous when he had too much time on his hands. When he arrived at Pixar that day, he went to Lasseter's office and explained that even just being an advisor at Apple would take up a lot of his time. He said he wanted Lasseter's blessing.
