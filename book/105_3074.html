<div class="line_en">It was a big gamble, and her stomach writhed with nausea every time she thought about it, but there was no other choice, no other option. Tristan was absolutely adamant that he couldn't -- physically couldn't -- go on past the wasteland line, and he wouldn't let her stay here. Where else was there to go?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一场豪赌。每次一想到这些，她的胃里就翻江倒海，一阵恶心。然而她实在别无他法，别无选择。崔斯坦坚信他的身体无法穿越荒原上那道分界线，他又不能让迪伦待在这儿。还有别的路可走吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And finally -- worst of all -- she was scared that she'd wake up, back on the train, all alone. That she'd make it back to the world, to life, only to discover that Tristan had been right: he couldn't come with her. She didn't know what she'd do if that happened. She could only hope, pray even, that fate would not be so cruel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有，最糟糕的是，她害怕等回到车厢里醒过来后，只剩自己一个人。那样的话，她返回尘世、起死回生反倒坐实了崔斯坦的猜测—他不可能和自己在一起。他不知道如果这样的事发生的话她该怎么办。她只能希望甚至暗自祈祷命运不要这么残酷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Despite her assurances to Tristan, Dylan was nervous about returning to the train tunnel, about trying to climb back into her body. She thought about what Jonas had said, how he'd warned her that she'd be going back into her body exactly as it was. She wished it hadn't been quite so dark in the train carriage. She had no idea how badly she'd been injured, what it was that had ripped her soul from its physical shell. She had no idea how much it was going to hurt when she woke back up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然迪伦一直在宽慰崔斯坦，但想起要回到那条火车隧道、爬回自己的尸体上，迪伦还是十分紧张。她想起了乔纳斯之前说过的话，他提醒她要回到原来的尸身。她希望车厢里不至于太黑。她也不知道自己伤得有多重，到底是什么东西让自己的灵魂出了窍。她不知道当自己还魂苏醒后这伤会有多痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was it. This was the place where she'd died. She stared down at the railway line, waiting to feel something. Loss or sadness -- pain, even. Instead she just felt the creeping sickness of fear and anxiety, the same nervousness she'd been fighting all day. She swallowed it back; she'd already made her decision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就是那儿，她当时就是在那里死去的。她俯视着铁轨，等待着心中涌起某种感情。是怅然若失、哀恸伤心，或是痛苦不堪，而最后她心头慢慢浮现出的只有恐惧和焦虑，那种她一整天都在拼命压抑的紧张感。她强忍着，默默下定了决心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan could think of no other reason for it except that she was with Tristan. Whatever happened, so long as she stayed with him, she could survive; she could cope. The bright sunshine was soothing, too. It helped keep her niggling thoughts pinned at the back of her mind, banishing them to the shadows where they belonged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦想，这全是因为自己和崔斯坦待在一起，否则她实在想不出别的原因了。不管发生什么，只要她和崔斯坦待在一起，她就能挺过去，应付得来。明媚的阳光也让人觉得宽慰，把那些烦恼都压制在意识深处，驱赶到了本属于它们的阴暗角落。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a lot to worry about, yet somehow, despite all this, as they ploughed their way through the final day's march, the sun stayed high in the sky, the clouds nowhere in sight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan expected to recognise the end of the journey, to be able to pick out landmarks that would tell her they were almost there and allow the excitement and nerves to percolate. But the last hill was just the same as the one that had come before it, and the one that had come before that, yet suddenly they were standing at its peak, looking down on a set of rusting rail tracks.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音听起来不像她那样紧张或急切，而是充满了忧伤。就好像他已经断定这次冒险一定会徒劳无功，他很害怕迪伦会失望。他的悲观情绪并没有影响到迪伦，因为她自己心里也难掩重重疑虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan didn't move and she realised he was waiting for her to take the lead. She took one deep breath, then another. Her feet didn't seem to want to move. They felt leaden, too heavy to lift from the dew-soaked grass. Was that just fear, or was it the wasteland, reluctant to let her go?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦没有动，她意识到他是在等她先走。她连续做了两次深呼吸，腿似乎不听使唤，感觉像灌了铅一样，沉甸甸的无法从露水深重的草地抬起来。这是因为自己害怕，还是荒原不想让她走？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her hand slid into the pocket of her jeans, fingers stroking the satin softness of the petals on the wildflower Tristan had given her. It had wilted since he'd picked it, but she'd refused to throw it away. Instead she held onto it like a talisman. Something to bind her to the wasteland; something to bind her to Tristan. Dylan only hoped that would be enough to keep them together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的手从牛仔裤口袋里伸了出来，用手指摩挲着崔斯坦送她的那朵丝绸般顺滑的花瓣。花被摘下来后已经枯萎了，但她还是舍不得扔掉，反而像护身符一样紧紧捏着它。它将迪伦和荒原联系起来，把她和崔斯坦联系在一起。迪伦只希望它能让她和崔斯坦永远在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's going to work," she muttered to the air, far too low for Tristan to hear. "We will make it back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一定会成功的。”她对着天空喃喃自语，声音小得连崔斯坦都听不到，“我们一定要回去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Setting her mouth into a determined line, she trudged forward. One hand gripped Tristan's tightly and, step by step, she dragged him along behind her. He was limping now, one hand permanently fixed to his side. But he'd be all right. If she could just get him through this last little bit, get him back to her world, he'd be all right. She made herself believe it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的嘴绷紧了，显出决绝的样子，然后步履艰难地向前走。一只手紧紧抓着身边的崔斯坦，一步一步挪移。现在他走路一瘸一拐的，一只手一直捂着身体右侧，但他会没事的。如果她能和他一起走完这最后的一小段路，带他回到她的世界，他就会安然无恙的。她强迫自己相信这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked down the hill until Dylan was able to step up onto the sleepers that turned the tracks into a ladder. Then she turned -- after checking with Tristan that she was heading in the right direction -- and began to follow the line towards the tunnel mouth. The tracks curved through the countryside, so at first she couldn't see it, but then, out of nowhere, they turned a corner and there it was. A giant hill stood immovable in their path. The tracks seemed to wind towards it, then disappear: a road to nowhere. The closer they got, though, the larger a dark arch at the base of the hill seemed to grow, until Dylan could clearly see where the train had entered the mountain. Entered, but not left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们往山下走，直到迪伦走到枕木上，看到像梯子一样的铁轨才停下来。她转过头，待向崔斯坦求证她走的方向无误后，就开始顺着铁路线向隧道口走去。铁轨沿着乡野蜿蜒铺开，所以一开始迪伦没有看见它们。可是突然之间，它们就在一个转弯处出现了。巨大的山峦在铁路沿线岿然屹立，铁轨似乎在向大山曲折前进，然后就消失在远方，不知通向何处。他们越走近，山脚下黑漆漆的山洞似乎也越变越大。最后迪伦终于看清了铁路钻山的入口，她走了进去，但这远不是终点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A black hole. Gaping and wide, it seemed to call to her. She shivered, the hairs standing up at the back of her neck. What if, what if, what if? Doubts whispered ferociously again at the back of her head but she tried to ignore them. She set her chin high in the air and marched determinedly forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑色的山洞张着大口，似乎在召唤她。迪伦哆嗦着，脖子上的汗毛都立了起来。万一，万一，万一呢？潜意识中的种种疑虑此刻化成了她耳边疯狂的窃窃私语，但她尽力不去理会它们。她高扬起下巴，迈着坚定的步伐向前继续走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had come a long, long way for this chance and she wasn't going back now. Not without at least trying. Besides, they couldn't stay here. Tristan was hurt. Whatever had happened to him, the wasteland was hurting him now. He was wrong: this wasn't where he belonged. He needed to get out. Dylan told herself that and tried not to listen to the whispering voice at the back of her head suggesting that his injuries, his agonies, were happening because she was trying to make him leave the wasteland. Squaring her shoulders, she headed into the dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她长途跋涉一路走来只为了这个机会，现在她不能回头，不能连试都不试一下就回去。而且，他们也不能待在这里，崔斯坦受伤了。不管之前发生了什么，现在的荒原正在伤害他。崔斯坦错了，他不属于这里，他需要离开。迪伦把这些念头在心头默念，尽力不去理会头脑深处传来的声音，“他之所以会受伤，之所以会痛苦，全是因为你正逼着他离开荒原。”她挺起胸继续向黑暗深处走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The black was disorienting at first, and their footsteps echoed off the closed-in walls. The air smelled of damp. Dylan shivered.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这里就是了。”他说着，把她的手放在半空中，刚好到他肩膀的位置。她的手四处摸索着，感觉手指下面是污垢和橡胶，那是列车门前的踏板。她意识到踏板很高，他们必须要攀爬上去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wait." He tugged at her, pulled with enough pressure to turn her round. Tristan's other arm snaked round her waist and he drew her to him. The tunnel floor was uneven and so, for once, his face was level with hers. She felt his breath tickling her cheek. "Look, I…" he started and then fell quiet. She heard him take a deep breath, then another. He gripped her chin, lifted it a fraction. "Just in case," he whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等等。”他使劲拽她，她只好转过头。崔斯坦的另一只胳膊游移到她的腰间，把她拉进自己怀里。隧道里的路高低不平，所以这一次他的脸正和迪伦的脸平齐。他的呼吸让迪伦觉得脸痒痒的。“看，我……”他先开了口，随即又沉默不语了。她听到他一声声沉重的呼吸。他捧着她的下巴，往上抬了一点点，“以防万一。”他小声说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were going to share a million other kisses just like this.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan smiled into nothingness. She hoped she was, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cautiously, she edged forward. The carriage was silent, but her pulse was roaring in her ears, so loud she could barely hear the sound of Tristan breathing just a step behind her. Her stomach was squirming. What if this didn't work? What if her body was battered and broken beyond repair?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她小心翼翼地往前慢慢挪动。车厢里一片死寂，然而她的脉搏跳动声听起来却异常响亮。崔斯坦在她身后仅一步之遥，可迪伦连他的呼吸声都几乎听不到了。她的肠胃剧烈地痉挛。如果这个办法行不通怎么办？如果她的身体破损严重无法修复怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know how we do this," she said quietly. "I think we have to find me. I was somewhere in the middle, I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道该怎么做，”她平静地说，“我觉得我们应该先找到我的身体。我想，应该是在列车中部。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ready?" she asked again, breathlessly this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“准备好了吗？”她又问了一遍，这一次她几乎窒息得说不出话来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan had time for just one, quick intake of breath, then she was falling. She reached out, desperate to stop herself tumbling down to the graveyard floor. Reached out with two hands. Two empty hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="落地前她还有时间猛吸了一口气。她奋力伸出手，免得直接摔倒在坟场一样的地板上。这次她两只手都伸了出去，空空的手里什么也没攥着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And what was lying on the ground between her soul and her body? What were they going to have to crawl over? Blood? Body parts? That stupid woman's bags? Dylan laughed at that, a tense bark. She turned to share the joke with Tristan, and felt her trainer swivel much too easily. Something slick was under her shoe. And it wasn't spilled juice, she was sure of that. Disgusted, she tried to yank her foot up, but something caught her heel. Off balance, she shuffled with her other foot, but there was something in the way. Her weight tilted back, leaning precariously, then tipping just a bit too far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那横在自己的灵魂和躯体之间的东西是什么？他们不得不越过去的东西是什么？鲜血、残肢，还是那个蠢女人的大包小包？迪伦想想忍不住笑了起来，笑声有些神经质。她转过头想把笑话和崔斯坦分享，这才发现自己的运动鞋转起来有点过于轻松了，鞋下面沾着一层滑滑的东西。她确定，这可不是什么溢出来的果汁。她感到一阵恶心，赶紧抬起脚，可脚跟却被什么东西绊住了。她一下子失去了平衡，把另一只脚也带得有些打滑，不过不知什么东西挡在了前面。她的重心又开始往后倾，这次有点矫枉过正，她摇摇晃晃地又往后倒去。">查看中文翻译</div>
