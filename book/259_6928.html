<div class="line_en">Morrie, dressed in pajama bottoms, lay in bed on his side, his head flush against the pillow, his mouth open. The physical therapist was showing me how to bang loose the poison in his lungs -- which he needed done regularly now, to keep it from solidifying, to keep him breathing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫里穿着睡裤侧卧在床上，他的头陷在枕头里，嘴巴张开着。理疗师在教我怎样把他肺部的毒物拍打出来——莫里现在需要按时做这种理疗，不然他的肺就会硬化，从而丧失呼吸的功能。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We all laughed, a nervous laughter that comes when the devil is within earshot. It would have been cute, this little scene, were it not what we all knew it was, the final calisthenics before death. Morrie's disease was now dangerously close to his surrender spot, his lungs. He had been predicting he would die from choking, and I could not imagine a more terrible way to go. Sometimes he would close his eyes and try to draw the air up into his mouth and nostrils, and it seemed as if he were trying to lift an anchor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们都笑了，这是面对魔鬼的临近而发出的惴惴不安的笑，如果没人知道这是莫里临死前的健身操，这场面或许会挺有趣的。莫里的病现在已经危险地逼近了他的最后一道防线—— 肺部。他已经预见到他最终会窒息而死，这是我所无法想象的。有时他会闭上眼睛，用力把一口气吸到嘴巴和鼻孔处，就像在做起锚前的准备工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, it was jacket weather, early October, the leaves clumped in piles on the lawns around West Newton. Morrie's physical therapist had come earlier in the day, and I usually excused myself when nurses or specialists had business with him. But as the weeks passed and our time ran down, I was increasingly less self-conscious about the physical embarrassment. I wanted to be there. I wanted to observe everything. This was not like me, but then, neither were a lot of things that had happened these last few months in Morrie's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚进十月，外面的气候开始转凉，吹落的树叶铺满了西纽顿周围的绿化地。莫里的理疗师比平时来得更早了。通常，当护士和专家在他身边忙碌时，我总是找借口避开的。但几个星期下来，随着我们的时间在不断缩短，我不再对人体的种种窘态那么敏感了。我想呆在那儿。我想看见发生的一切。这不是我平常的性格。但最后几个月发生在莫里家中的一切也是不平常的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I watched the therapist work on Morrie in the bed, pounding the back of his ribs, asking if he could feel the congestion loosening within him. And when she took a break, she asked if I wanted to try it. I said yes. Morrie, his face on the pillow, gave a little smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我看着理疗师对躺在床上的莫里进行治疗，她叩击莫里背部的肋骨，问他是否感觉到胸口的郁闷有所缓解。她停下来休息时，问我想不想试试。我说行。莫里埋在枕头里的脸上浮现出一丝笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I drummed on his back and sides, moving around, as she instructed. I hated the idea of Morrie's lying in bed under any circumstances (his last aphorism, "When you're in bed, you're dead," rang in my ears), and curled on his side, he was so small, so withered, it was more a boy's body than a man's. I saw the paleness of his skin, the stray white hairs, the way his arms hung limp and helpless. I thought about how much time we spend trying to shape our bodies, lifting weights, crunching sit-ups, and in the end, nature takes it away from us anyhow. Beneath my fingers, I felt the loose flesh around Morrie's bones, and I thumped him hard, as instructed. The truth is, I was pounding on his back when I wanted to be hitting the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='我在她的指导下，来来回回敲打着他的背部和侧部。我不愿去想莫里躺在床上的情形（他最新的格言"当你在床上时，你就是个死人"又回响在我的耳边），蜷缩着身子侧卧在床上的莫里显得那么瘦小，那么枯槁，简直就跟一个孩子的身材差不多大。我看见了他白皙的皮肤， 零散的白色汗毛，看见了他疲软下垂的双臂。我想起了我们曾热衷于健身：举杠铃，练仰卧起坐；然而最终自然又将我们的肌肉夺了回去。我的手指触摸在莫里松弛的肌肉上，我按着理疗师的指导拍打着他。而实际上，当我在捶打他的背部时，我真正想捶打的却是墙壁。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"People are only mean when they're threatened," he said later that day, "and that's what our culture does. That's what our economy does. Even people who have jobs in our economy are threatened, because they worry about losing them. And when you get threatened, you start looking out only for yourself. You start making money a god. It is all part of this culture."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"人只有在受到威胁时才变坏，"他那天对我说，"而这一威胁正是来自我们的文明社会， 来自我们的经济制度。即使有工作的人也会受到威胁，因为他会担心失去它。当你受到威胁时，你就会只为自己的利益考虑，你就会视金钱为上帝。这就是我们文化的一部分。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrie believed in the inherent good of people. But he also saw what they could become.</div>

<div class="line_en">I nodded at him and squeezed his hand. We held hands regularly now. This was another change for me. Things that before would have made me embarrassed or squeamish were now routinely handled. The catheter bag, connected to the tube inside him and filled with greenish waste fluid, lay by my foot near the leg of his chair. A few months earlier, it might have disgusted me; it was inconsequential now. So was the smell of the room after Morrie had used the commode. He did not have the luxury of moving from place to place, of closing a bathroom door behind him, spraying some air freshener when he left. There was his bed, there was his chair, and that was his life. If my life were squeezed into such a thimble, I doubt I could make it smell any better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='我点点头，握紧他的手。我们现在常常握手，这是发生在我身上的又一个变化。从前使我感到窘迫和拘谨的事情现在则成了家常便饭，通过一根管子连接到他体内，里面装满了黄色尿液的导管袋就放在我的脚边。早几个月它会使我感到恶心，现在我一点也无所谓。莫里，"厕后留在房间里的气味同样对我没有影响。他没有条件更换居住的房间，也无法关上厕所的门往屋里喷洒空气清新剂。这是他的床，这是他的椅子，这是他的生活。如果我的生活也被圈在这样一个弹丸之地，我想我留下的气味也好不到哪儿去。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here's what I mean by building your own little subculture," Morrie said. "I don't mean you disregard every rule of your community. I don't go around naked, for example. I don't run through red lights. The little things, I can obey. But the big things -- how we think, what we value -- those you must choose yourself. You can't let anyone -- or any society determine those for you.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Every society has its own problems," Morrie said, lifting his eyebrows, the closest he could come to a shrug. "The way to do it, I think, isn't to run away. You have to work at creating your own culture.</div>
