<div class="line_en">She got out of her rickshaw in the Victoria Road and walked up the steep, narrow lane till she came to the shop. She lingered outside a moment as though her attention were attracted by the bric-a-brac which was displayed. But a boy who was standing there on the watch for customers, recognizing her at once, gave her a broad smile of connivance. He said something in Chinese to some one within and the master, a little, fat-faced man in a black gown, came out and greeted her. She walked in quickly.</div>

<div class="line_en">She went to the back of the shop and walked up the rickety, dark stairs. The Chinese followed her and unlocked the door that led into the bedroom. It was stuffy and there was an acrid smell of opium. She sat down on a sandalwood chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走到店的后边，爬上一段摇摇晃晃的昏暗的楼梯。那个中国人紧跟上来，给她打开了进到卧房的门。屋里很小，也不通气，弥漫着一股鸦片的刺鼻气味。她在一个檀香木的柜子上坐了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a moment she heard a heavy step on the creaking stairs. Townsend came in and shut the door behind him. His face bore a sullen look, as he saw her it vanished, and he smiled in that charming way of his. He took her quickly in his arms and kissed her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，她听见一阵沉重的脚步声，楼梯也跟着咯吱咯吱地响。唐生进了屋，随手把门关紧。刚进来时他脸色阴沉，一见到她立即换成了迷人的微笑。他一把将她搂在怀里，亲了亲她的嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛看向了她。他的微笑没有消失，然而却好像走了样，显得极其不自然。她看出他眼里隐藏着焦虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She dropped her eyes. She was not sure if Charlie understood. As a rule Walter took her in his arms and pressed his lips to hers and would not let them go. His whole body grew tender and passionate with his kiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的眼睛看向了地板。她不知道查理能不能懂。通常瓦尔特会用胳膊搂住她，然后把嘴唇贴到她的嘴唇上，亲好一会儿。他的身体随后会变得十分温柔，因为亲吻而激动不已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a pause. Kitty sat very still on the sandalwood box and looked with anxious attention at Towns-end. His face once more was sullen and there was a frown between his brows. His mouth drooped a little at the corners. But all at once he looked up and a gleam of malicious amusement came into his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又是沉默。凯蒂纹丝不动地坐在檀香木的柜子上，神情焦急地望着唐生。他的脸再度陷入了阴沉，眉毛拧到了一起，连嘴角也撇到了一边。然后他猛地抬起头来，眼里放着狡黠的光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wonder if he is going to say anything.".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他要是说什么了才怪呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She did not answer. She did not know what he meant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没做声。她还没明白他说的是什么意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"After all, he wouldn't be the first man who's shut his eyes in a case of this sort. What has he to gain by making a row? If he'd wanted to make a row he would have insisted on coming into your room." His eyes twinkled and his lips broke into a broad smile. "We should have looked a pair of damned fools."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说到底，碰到这种事儿睁一只眼闭一只眼的人，他不是第一个。为这事儿闹翻了他能得到什么呢？他要是想闹的话，那天就会不由分说进房里来了。”他的眼睛闪着光，嘴角越咧越大，“我们刚才真像是十足的笨蛋。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish you could have seen his face last night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你应该看看他昨晚的脸色。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I expect he was upset. It was naturally a shock. It's a damned humiliating position for any man. He always looks a fool. Walter doesn't give me the impression of a fellow who'd care to wash a lot of dirty linen in public."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜他很苦恼，这对他肯定是个打击。这种处境对哪个男人来说都很难挨。不过他一直都很蠢。瓦尔特不是那种敢把家丑外扬的男人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think he would," she answered reflectively, "He's very sensitive, I've discovered that."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's all to the good as far as we're concerned. You know, it's a very good plan to put yourself in somebody else's shoes and ask yourself how you would act in his place. There's only one way in which a man can save his face when he's in that sort of position and that is to pretend he knows nothing. I bet you anything you like that that is exactly what he's going to do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“目前来看情况对我们有利。你知道，设身处地从他的角度想一想，看看他会怎么做，你就知道该怎么做了。男人遇到这种处境只有一种保住面子的办法，那就是装作什么也不知道。我敢打赌这就是他的打算。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Heaven knows, I don't want to say anything disagreeable about him, but when you come down to brass tacks a bacteriologist is no great shakes. The chances are that I shall be Colonial Secretary when Simmons goes home, and it's to Walter's interest to keep on the right side of me. He's got his bread and butter to think of, like the rest of us: do you think the Colonial Office are going to do much for a fellow who makes a scandal? Believe me, he's got everything to gain by holding his tongue and everything to lose by kicking up a row."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“上天作证，我不是故意说他不好听的话。不过你从根子上想一想，一个研究细菌的能有多大的分量。现在的机会是，等西蒙斯一走，我就将是布政司，瓦尔特要不要站在我这边事关他的前程。为了保住饭碗，他的想法肯定跟我们大家的都一样：殖民政府会收留一个闹出丑闻来的小子吗？相信我，他要是把嘴闭得紧紧的，就能保住现有的一切。要是他想撕破脸，那他的好日子就到此为止了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty moved uneasily. She knew how shy Walter was and she could believe that the fear of a scene, and the dread of public attention, might have influence upon him; but she could not believe that he would be affected by the thought of a material advantage. Perhaps she didn't know him very well, but Charlie didn't know him at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她别扭地挪了两下身体。她知道瓦尔特有多害羞，他害怕见大场面，他想过了这事儿一定会让大家的眼睛都盯着他。但是她不相信他会把饭碗这些世俗的东西看得有多重。或许她不是十分了解瓦尔特，但查理对他的了解什么也谈不上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Has it occurred to you that he's madly in love with me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得瓦尔特真的疯狂地爱我吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I put it to you that you haven't been bothering much about your husband lately. Perhaps he isn't quite so much in love with you as he was."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我斗胆认为你近来并未试探过他的真心。或许他不如以前那样爱你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, what is it? I know you're going to say something awful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃？接着说？我知道你要说点可怕的话出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, you know, women are often under the impression that men are much more madly in love with them than they really are."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，你知道，女人常常自以为是地认为男人疯狂地爱上了她们。实际上他们没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He did not answer, but he smiled at her with roguish eyes. She knew and loved that charming look of his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没回答，只是微微一笑，眼睛调皮地望着她。这个表情对她来说太有魅力了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At all events I shall never delude myself that you are madly in love with me," she retorted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无论如何我并未奢望你那么深爱我。”她反戈一击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the first time she laughed. His confidence was catching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她终于露出了笑容，看来他的信誓旦旦起了效果。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ah, how good it was to hear him say that! She knew it and her belief in his passion warmed her heart. As he spoke he rose from the bed and came and sat down beside her on the sandalwood box. He put his arm round her waist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈，听到这句话简直叫她心花怒放。她知道他会这么说，她相信他说的是真话，这叫她心里暖融融的。说完他从床上站了起来，走到她的身边和她一起坐在檀香木柜上。他的胳膊扶住了她的腰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She leaned towards him. Her body became limp and yielding against his arm. The love she felt for him was almost torture. His last words had struck her: perhaps Walter loved her so passionately that he was prepared to accept any humiliation if sometimes she would let him love her. She could understand that; for that was how she felt towards Charlie. A thrill of pride passed through her, and at the same time a faint sensation of contempt for a man who could love so slavishly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把身体靠向他，软软地倒在他的胳膊上。爱他对她来说几乎就是个折磨。但他的最后一句话不无道理。可能瓦尔特是爱她很深，他宁可忍下任何羞辱，只要她还在他身边让他爱她。她理解那种感受，因为她对查理同样如此。她为自己的爱感到骄傲起来，同时也为一个男人可以如此低三下四地爱一个女人而愤然藐视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't worry your silly little head a moment longer," he said. "I promise you there's nothing to fear. I'm as certain as I am of anything that he's going to pretend he knows nothing. You know, this sort of thing is awfully difficult to prove. You say he's in love with you; perhaps he doesn't want to lose you altogether. I swear I'd accept anything rather than that if you were my wife."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别再折磨你那个傻脑瓜了。”他说，“你尽可放心。我下一千个保证，他一定是假装没有过这事儿。你知道，这种事很难说的。你不是说过他爱你吗？可能他根本不想失去你。我敢发誓要是你是我妻子，不管出什么事我也会不在乎。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She gave a little laugh, a laugh of happy love and of triumph; his eyes were heavy with desire. He lifted her to her feet and not letting her go but holding her close to his breast he locked the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她快乐地笑了一声，他爱她，这是她的胜利。他的眼底燃烧着欲火。他抱起她的腿，将胸膛向她压得更紧。他拴住了门。">查看中文翻译</div>
