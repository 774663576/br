The morning that they took her, Laila and Giti went to Hasina's house to say good-bye. Hasina told them that the cousin, her husband-to-be, had already started the process to move them to Germany, where his brothers lived. Within the year, she thought, they would be in Frankfurt.

Mammy's heroes, Ahmad's and Noor's brothers-in-war, had won.

<div class="line_en">In Kabul, Najibullah changed tactics and tried to portray himself as a devout Muslim. "Too little and far too late," said Babi. "You can't be the chief of KHAD one day and the next day pray in a mosque with people whose relatives you tortured and killed." Feeling the noose tightening around Kabul, Najibullah tried to reach a settlement with the Mujahideen but the Mujahideen balked.</div>

<div class="line_en">And, of course, there was Mammy's hero, Rabbani's ally, the brooding, charismatic Tajik commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, the Lion of Panjshir. Mammy had nailed up a poster of him in her room. Massoud's handsome, thoughtful face, eyebrow cocked and trademark pakol tilted, would become ubiquitous in Kabul. His soulful black eyes would gaze back from billboards, walls, storefront windows, from little flags mounted on the antennas of taxicabs.</div>

The intense, surly Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the Hezb-e-Islami faction, a Pashtun who had studied engineering and once killed a Maoist student. Rabbani, Tajik leader of the Jamiat-e-Islami faction, who had taught Islam at Kabul University in the days of the monarchy. Sayyaf, a Pashtun from Paghman with Arab connections, a stout Muslim and leader of the Ittehad-i-Islami faction.

She put on a cobalt blue linen dress with white polka dots. She washed the windows, swept the floor, aired the house, took a long bath. Her voice was shrill with merriment.</div>

<div class="line_en">She began moving pots and pans around, theatrically, as though she were laying claim to them anew, restaking her territory, now that she was back. Laila stayed out of her way. It was best. Mammy could be as indomitable in her fits of euphoria as in her attacks of rage. With unsettling energy, Mammy set about cooking: aush soup with kidney beans and dried dill, kofta, steaming hot mantu drenched with fresh yogurt and topped with mint.</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila opened her mouth to say something. It wasn't that Mammy didn't have a point. Laila knew that the days of innocent, unhindered frolicking in the streets with Tariq had passed. For some time now, Laila had begun to sense a new strangeness when the two of them were out in public. An awareness of being looked at, scrutinized, whispered about, that Laila had never felt before. And wouldn't have felt even now but for one fundamental fact: She had fallen for Tariq. Hopelessly and desperately. When he was near, she couldn't help but be consumed with the most scandalous thoughts, of his lean, bare body entangled with hers. Lying in bed at night, she pictured him kissing her belly, wondered at the softness of his lips, at the feel of his hands on her neck, her chest, her back, and lower still. When she thought of him this way, she was overtaken with guilt, but also with a peculiar, warm sensation that spread upward from her belly until it felt as if her face were glowing pink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉张开嘴巴，想说点什么。妈妈说的也不是半点道理都没有。莱拉早知道那些和塔里克在马路上无拘无束地嬉闹的天真日子已经一去不返了。因为现在有时候，当他们两个人一起出现在人前的时候，她会有一种以前没有的陌生感觉。莱拉会意识到有人在看着他们，打量着他们，低声谈论着他们，这种感觉原来是没有的。如果不是因为出现了一个最要命的事实，她连现在也不会有这种感觉：她已经爱上了塔里克。无助地，绝望地爱上了他。每当他在身旁时，她脑子里总是忍不住充满一些羞耻的念头，总是想着他瘦长的裸体和她自己的裸体纠缠在一起。到了夜晚，躺在床上的她会想像他正在亲吻她的腹部，想知道他的嘴唇有多么柔软，想知道他的手摸着她的脖子、胸脯、后背和更低的部位是什么感觉。每当这样想起他时，她心里会充满罪恶的感觉，但小腹也会升起一丝特殊的暖流，直到她感觉到好像自己的脸庞在发烧。">查看中文翻译</div>

All those years of aloofness, of cooping herself up and not caring where Laila went and whom she saw and what she thought… It was unfair. Laila felt like she was no better than these pots and pans, something that could go neglected, then laid claim to, at will, whenever the mood struck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但让莱拉愤愤不平的是，妈妈根本没有资格说这种话。这个问题如果是爸爸提出来的，那是一回事。可是妈妈？这么多年来，她不闻不问，只顾把自己关在屋子里，一点都不关心莱拉去哪里、碰到什么人、有什么心事……太不公平了。莱拉觉得她跟厨房里这些锅碗差不多，是一种可以被置之不理、等到心血来潮的时候再理睬的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila suspected that some, if not most, of the neighbors were already gossiping about her and Tariq. Laila had noticed the sly grins, was aware of the whispers in the neighborhood that the two of them were a couple. The other day, for instance, she and Tariq were walking up the street together when they'd passed Rasheed, the shoemaker, with his burqa-clad wife, Mariam, in tow. As he'd passed by them, Rasheed had playfully said, "If it isn't Laili and Majnoon," referring to the star-crossed lovers of Nezami's popular twelfth-century romantic poem -- a Farsi version of Romeo and Juliet, Babi said, though he added that Nezami had written his tale of ill-fated lovers four centuries before Shakespeare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉怀疑邻居就算不是大多数人、至少也有几个人已经在说她和塔里克的闲话了。莱拉看到过那些不怀好意的笑脸，也知道邻居私下说他们是一对。例如，有一天，她和塔里克手拉手走在街道上，遇到鞋匠拉希德和他那个穿着布卡的妻子。和他们擦肩而过时，拉希德开玩笑说：“那不是赖里和玛姬浓吗？”他说的是内扎米[1]那首妇孺皆知的12世纪浪漫诗中一对命运悲惨的恋人——爸爸说那首诗是法尔西语的《罗密欧与朱丽叶》，但他还加上一句，内扎米创作这个凄恻爱情故事的时间，比莎士比亚早了四百年。【注：[1]Nezami Ganjavi（1141～1209），古代波斯诗人。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">IT WAS A dazzling, cloudless day, perfect for a party. The men sat on rickety folding chairs in the yard. They drank tea and smoked and talked in loud bantering voices about the Mujahideen's plan. From Babi, Laila had learned the outline of it: Afghanistan was now called the Islamic State of Afghanistan. An Islamic Jihad Council, formed in Peshawar by several of the Mujahideen factions, would oversee things for two months, led by Sibghatullah Mojadidi. This would be followed then by a leadership council led by Rabbani, who would take over for four months. During those six months, a loya jirga would be held, a grand council of leaders and elders, who would form an interim government to hold power for two years, leading up to democratic elections.</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila was in the kitchen, making carafes of dogh with Giti. Giti was no longer as shy, or as serious, as before. For several months now, the perpetual severe scowl had cleared from her brow. She laughed openly these days, more frequently, and -- it struck Laila -- a bit flirtatiously. She had done away with the drab ponytails, let her hair grow, and streaked it with red highlights. Laila learned eventually that the impetus for this transformation was an eighteen-year-old boy whose attention Giti had caught. His name was Sabir, and he was a goalkeeper on Giti's older brother's soccer team.</div>

<div class="line_en">From the excited voices around her, Laila caught snippets that she put together: The fellow at the politics table, a Pashtun, had called Ahmad Shah Massoud a traitor for "making a deal" with the Soviets in the 1980s. The kebab man, a Tajik, had taken offense and demanded a retraction. The Pashtun had refused. The Tajik had said that if not for Massoud, the other man's sister would still be "giving it" to Soviet soldiers. They had come to blows. One of them had then brandished a knife; there was disagreement as to who.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身边的人兴奋地吵吵嚷嚷，莱拉把听到的片言只语拼了起来：在桌子上谈论时局的那个家伙是个普什图人，他说艾哈迈德·沙·马苏德是个卖国贼，因为他之前与苏联“达成了一项交易”。烤肉的男人是塔吉克人，他觉得被冒犯了，要求前者收回这句话。那个普什图人拒绝了。塔吉克人说如果不是马苏德，另外那个人的妹妹可能还在“把它”献给苏联士兵呢。他们拳打脚踢起来。其中有个人挥舞着一把刀，但究竟是谁出了刀，大家的意见并不一致。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a melee in the yard. In the middle of it were two snarling men, rolling on the ground, a knife between them. Laila recognized one of them as a man from the table who had been discussing politics earlier. The other was the man who had been fanning the kebab skewers. Several men were trying to pull them apart. Babi wasn't among them. He stood by the wall, at a safe distance from the fight, with Tariq's father, who was crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人在院子里打了起来。正在扭打的是两个不断咆哮的男人，他们在地面上翻来滚去，他们之间有一把刀。莱拉认出他们来了，一个刚才在桌子上谈论政局，另外一个就是早先在给烤肉串扇风的人。好几个男人在旁边劝架。爸爸不在其中。他站在墙边，离扭打的双方远远的，塔里克的父亲站在他身旁，正在大声叫喊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With horror, Laila saw that Tariq had thrown himself into the scuffle. She also saw that some of the peacemakers were now throwing punches of their own. She thought she spotted a second knife.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that evening, Laila thought of how the melee had toppled over, with men falling on top of one another, amid yelps and cries and shouts and flying punches, and, in the middle of it, a grimacing Tariq, his hair disheveled, his leg come undone, trying to crawl out.</div>
