<div class="line_en">Maybe she should feel bad about involving him in all this, but she didn't. He was right, the worst thing that would happen to him (barring some terrible accident) was that he'd be grounded. And being grounded at his house was like winning the Price is Right showcase compared to what would happen if Eleanor got caught.</div>
