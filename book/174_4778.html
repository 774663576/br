<div class="line_en">"Let us now," said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort, "take a peep into the future"; and they all gave themselves the twist that makes peeps into the future easier. "Years have rolled by, and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，”温迪说，鼓起勇气进行一次最后的努力，“让我们来瞄一眼，看看将来的事吧；”于是大家都扭动了一下，这样可以更容易看到将来。“过了许多年，一位不知道年龄的漂亮小姐在伦敦车站下了火车，她是谁呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“很久以前，”彼得说，“我也和你们一样，相信我的母亲会永远开着窗子等我；所以，我在外面呆了一个月又一个月才飞回去；可是，窗子已经上了栓，因为母亲已经把我全忘了，另有一个小男孩睡在了我的床上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against grown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，当然他是非常在乎的；他对那些大人一肚子的怨气，那些大人老是把一切都搞糟。所以，每当他钻进树洞，他就故意短促地呼吸，大约每秒钟呼吸五次之多。他这样做，是因为在永无乡有个说法，你每呼吸一次，就有一个大人死去。所以彼得就心存报复地把他们杀死越多越好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now equipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were dejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they had not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，那些孩子都愁惨惨地呆望着温迪。温迪和约翰和迈克尔已经收拾停当，准备上路。这时，孩子们心情沮丧，不单是因为他们就要失去温迪，而且是因为，他们觉得有什么好事在等着温迪，可没有他们的份。新奇的事照例是他们所喜欢的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And now, Peter," Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, "I am going to give you your medicine before you go." She loved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught (portion), for just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，彼得，”温迪说，心想她一切都弄妥了，“在走之前，我要给你们吃药。”她喜欢给他们药吃，而且一定是给得太多。当然啦，那只不过是清水；不过，水是从一只葫芦瓶里倒出来的。温迪总是摇晃着葫芦瓶，数着滴数，这就使得那水有了药性。但是，这一回她没有给彼得吃，因为她刚要给他吃的时候，忽然看到彼得脸上的神情，不由得心头一沉。">查看中文翻译</div>

Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.</div>
