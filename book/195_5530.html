<div class="line_en">On Tuesdays and Fridays masters spent the morning at Amitrano's, criticising the work done. In France the painter earns little unless he paints portraits and is patronised by rich Americans; and men of reputation are glad to increase their incomes by spending two or three hours once a week at one of the numerous studios where art is taught. Tuesday was the day upon which Michel Rollin came to Amitrano's. He was an elderly man, with a white beard and a florid complexion, who had painted a number of decorations for the State, but these were an object of derision to the students he instructed: he was a disciple of Ingres, impervious to the progress of art and angrily impatient with that tas de farceurs whose names were Manet, Degas, Monet, and Sisley; but he was an excellent teacher, helpful, polite, and encouraging. Foinet, on the other hand, who visited the studio on Fridays, was a difficult man to get on with. He was a small, shrivelled person, with bad teeth and a bilious air, an untidy gray beard, and savage eyes; his voice was high and his tone sarcastic. He had had pictures bought by the Luxembourg, and at twenty-five looked forward to a great career; but his talent was due to youth rather than to personality, and for twenty years he had done nothing but repeat the landscape which had brought him his early success. When he was reproached with monotony, he answered:</div>

<div class="line_en">He was envious of everyone else's success, and had a peculiar, personal loathing of the impressionists; for he looked upon his own failure as due to the mad fashion which had attracted the public, sale bete, to their works. The genial disdain of Michel Rollin, who called them impostors, was answered by him with vituperation, of which crapule and canaille were the least violent items; he amused himself with abuse of their private lives, and with sardonic humour, with blasphemous and obscene detail, attacked the legitimacy of their births and the purity of their conjugal relations: he used an Oriental imagery and an Oriental emphasis to accentuate his ribald scorn. Nor did he conceal his contempt for the students whose work he examined. By them he was hated and feared; the women by his brutal sarcasm he reduced often to tears, which again aroused his ridicule; and he remained at the studio, notwithstanding the protests of those who suffered too bitterly from his attacks, because there could be no doubt that he was one of the best masters in Paris. Sometimes the old model who kept the school ventured to remonstrate with him, but his expostulations quickly gave way before the violent insolence of the painter to abject apologies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="别人一成功，他就眼红。尤其是印象主义流派更是他的眼中钉、肉中刺，他把自己的失败全归咎于社会的喜新厌旧：这群人——让人作呕的畜生——都跑去一股脑地推崇印象主义了。米歇尔·罗林也看不惯印象主义，但只是温和地责备他们是“骗子”，但福瓦内的语言要激烈得多。骂个“淫棍”“流氓”都算是轻的。他以谩骂诋毁印象主义画家的私生活为乐趣，极尽讽刺之能，言语下流地骂他们是私生子，说不光他们整天乱搞，连老婆都红杏出墙给他们戴绿帽子。为了让这些污言秽语更难以入耳，还用上一些东方文学里常见的比喻和强调。检查学生画作时，他也丝毫懒得隐藏自己的轻蔑之情。学生都对他又恨又怕，一些女孩子被他讽刺得呜呜直哭，他看见了反而更变本加厉地数落一通。虽然被他打击过的学生都一致反对让他继续留在画室执教，可他还是在这儿待得好好的，因为毫无疑问，他是巴黎最好的画师之一。有时候在学校待了好多年，一向遵规守矩的模特也会壮着胆子和他争论几句，但是在这个傲慢无礼的画家面前也都很快败下阵来，最后只能低声下气地赔礼道歉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Foinet with whom Philip first came in contact. He was already in the studio when Philip arrived. He went round from easel to easel, with Mrs. Otter, the massiere, by his side to interpret his remarks for the benefit of those who could not understand French. Fanny Price, sitting next to Philip, was working feverishly. Her face was sallow with nervousness, and every now and then she stopped to wipe her hands on her blouse; for they were hot with anxiety. Suddenly she turned to Philip with an anxious look, which she tried to hide by a sullen frown.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at Foinet, who was coming towards them with Mrs. Otter. Mrs. Otter, meek, mediocre, and self-satisfied, wore an air of importance. Foinet sat down at the easel of an untidy little Englishwoman called Ruth Chalice. She had the fine black eyes, languid but passionate, the thin face, ascetic but sensual, the skin like old ivory, which under the influence of Burne-Jones were cultivated at that time by young ladies in Chelsea. Foinet seemed in a pleasant mood; he did not say much to her, but with quick, determined strokes of her charcoal pointed out her errors. Miss Chalice beamed with pleasure when he rose. He came to Clutton, and by this time Philip was nervous too but Mrs. Otter had promised to make things easy for him. Foinet stood for a moment in front of Clutton's work, biting his thumb silently, then absent-mindedly spat out upon the canvas the little piece of skin which he had bitten off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看着福瓦内和奥特夫人一起朝这边走过来。奥特夫人看上去是个长相普普通通、脾气很好的女人，但周身带着一股自以为是的气质。福瓦内在一个邋遢的英国女人的画架旁坐了下来。这人叫露丝·查理斯，她的眼睛乌黑漂亮，乍一看好像没精打采的，细看却暗暗闪着热情的光芒。查理斯消瘦的脸上硬邦邦的，没有表情，但竟别有一番性感韵味。她的肤色像是放旧了的象牙，这正是在伯恩·琼斯影响下，切尔西的年轻女子竞相追求的肤色。福瓦内似乎心情不错，没跟露丝说太多话，只是拿过她的炭笔把画上的几处错误干脆利索地圈出来。他起身的时候，查理斯一脸喜笑颜开。下一个要检查的是克拉顿，菲利普现在也感到特别紧张，但奥特夫人说老师会对他宽松一点的。福瓦内在克拉顿的画前站了一会儿，静静地咬着大拇指，然后心不在焉地把啃下来的一小块死皮吐在画布上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked towards the gallery. Caillebotte's collection had lately been placed on view, and the student for the first time had the opportunity to examine at his ease the works of the impressionists. Till then it had been possible to see them only at Durand-Ruel's shop in the Rue Lafitte (and the dealer, unlike his fellows in England, who adopt towards the painter an attitude of superiority, was always pleased to show the shabbiest student whatever he wanted to see), or at his private house, to which it was not difficult to get a card of admission on Tuesdays, and where you might see pictures of world-wide reputation. Miss Price led Philip straight up to Manet's Olympia. He looked at it in astonished silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip felt ashamed of himself. Fanny Price had picked up the glib chatter of the studios and had no difficulty in impressing Philip with the extent of her knowledge. She proceeded to explain the pictures to him, superciliously but not without insight, and showed him what the painters had attempted and what he must look for. She talked with much gesticulation of the thumb, and Philip, to whom all she said was new, listened with profound but bewildered interest. Till now he had worshipped Watts and Burne-Jones. The pretty colour of the first, the affected drawing of the second, had entirely satisfied his aesthetic sensibilities. Their vague idealism, the suspicion of a philosophical idea which underlay the titles they gave their pictures, accorded very well with the functions of art as from his diligent perusal of Ruskin he understood it; but here was something quite different: here was no moral appeal; and the contemplation of these works could help no one to lead a purer and a higher life. He was puzzled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普觉得自己好丢脸。范宁·普里斯把各个画室里争论不休的话题重新评价一番，轻而易举地就让菲利普对她广博的见识敬佩不已。她接着解读起画廊里的作品，神态虽高高在上，但确实说出了自己的不少见解。她告诉菲利普作者画画的时候是想表达什么思想，以及应该怎么欣赏这些画。她一边说，一边伸着大拇指比比划划，菲利普对她说的所有内容都觉得新鲜。他听得津津有味，既入神又困惑。他现在最崇拜沃茨和伯恩·琼斯。前者色彩明朗鲜丽，后者则情意浓浓，菲利普挑剔敏感的审美得到了极大满足。这些画作里体现出的朦胧的理想主义，和它们标题里暗含的哲学思想与菲利普正在苦读的罗斯金作品中写到的艺术功能不期而合。但有一点不同：这些人的画里均没有道德诉求。观赏这些画作也不能让人上升到更纯洁、更高尚的境地。菲利普有点不解。">查看中文翻译</div>
