<div class="line_en">Then, looking around, he saw a pool of water less than a hundred yards away from where he was standing. He closed his eyes and opened them to make sure he wasn't imagining it. The pool was still there.</div>

<div class="line_en">He hurried toward it. The pool hurried away from him, moving as he moved, stopping when he stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他急忙赶过去。那摊水也迅速地离他远去。他走一步，那摊水就挪一下；他停下脚步，那摊水就不再移动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed pointless. He could see there was nothing ahead of him. Nothing but emptiness. He was hot, tired, hungry, and, most of all, thirsty. Maybe he should just turn around now. Maybe he'd already gone halfway and didn't know it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看上去似乎毫无意义。前方什么也看不到，只有旷野。他又热又累又饿，但最糟糕的还是渴。或许现在就该往回走。或许已经走完半程了，只是自己不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kept walking. He still carried the empty sack of sunflower seeds. He didn't know if he might find something to put in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续朝前走，手里仍旧拎着那只袋子。他不知道是否能找点东西装进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun was almost directly overhead. He figured he could walk for no more than another hour, maybe two, before he had to turn back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="烈日正当空照。他估摸着最多只能再走上一两个钟头，然后就得折返。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There wasn't any water. It was a mirage caused by the shimmering waves of heat rising off the dry ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="根本没有水。只是在干涸的大地上方，闪闪发光的热空气制造出来的幻影而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a while he thought he could make out the shape of the mountains through the haze. At first he wasn't sure if this was another kind of mirage, but the farther he walked, the clearer they came into a view. Almost straight ahead of him, he could see what looked like a fist, with its thumb sticking up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，他觉得透过混浊的空气看到了山的轮廓。一开始，他不确定这次会不会也是海市蜃楼，但是越往前走，景象就越发清晰。几乎就在正前方，有一座拳头一样的山峰，大拇指指向天空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't know how far away it was. Five miles? Fifty miles? One thing was certain. It was more than halfway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道那座山究竟还有多远，五英里？五十英里？但有一件事可以确定，已经走过了半程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kept walking toward it, although he didn't know why. He knew he'd have to turn around before he got there. But every time he looked at it, it seemed to encourage him, giving him the thumbs-up sign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管不明白究竟是为了什么，但他还是继续朝那座山走去。他知道还没到山跟前就得往回走。可是，每次他打量那座山，它似乎在鼓励他，冲他竖着大拇指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The object, whatever it was, was not on the way to Big Thumb but off to the right. He tried to decide whether to go to it or continue toward Big Thumb. Or maybe just turn around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论那是什么，它并没有横在去大拇指的路当中，而是在有些偏右的地方。他有些犹豫，不知是该去看看那东西，还是继续往大拇指的方向走去，或者干脆掉头回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no point in heading toward Big Thumb, he decided. He would never make it. For all he knew it was like chasing the moon. But he could make it to the mysterious object.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他断定继续朝大拇指走没有什么意义。他根本走不到那里。他只知道这无异于追月。但是他可以到达那个神秘的东西那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he continued walking, he became aware of a large object on the lake. He couldn't tell what it was, or even if it was natural or man-made. It looked a little like a fallen tree, although it didn't seem likely that a tree would grow here. More likely, it was a ridge of dirt or rocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续朝前走，忽然看到湖里有一个大家伙。他不知道那是什么东西，甚至没法确定那究竟是天然的还是人工的。那东西看起来有点像一棵倒在地上的树，但这地方显然不像能长出树。那更像是一堆土，或是一簇石块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He changed directions. He doubted it was anything, but the fact that there was something in the middle of all this nothing made it hard for him to pass up. He decided to make the object his halfway point, and he hoped he hadn't already gone too far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他改变方向了。他怀疑那东西其实什么也不是，然而在什么都没有的地方竟然有样东西这个事实本身令他难以放弃。他决定走到那边就算是走完了一半的路程，他希望自己走得还不算太远。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The name of the boat had been painted on the back. The upside-down red letters were peeled and faded, but Stanley could still read the name: Mary Lou.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船的名字刻在背面。上下颠倒的红字有些已经剥落了，字迹也已经褪了色，但斯坦利还是认出了那个名字：玛丽·露。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone may have drowned here, he thought grimly -- at the same spot where he could very well die of thirst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人也许在这里淹死了，他越想越觉得可怕——很有可能他也会渴死在这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He heard a noise. Something stirred under the boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听到一点声响。船下面有东西在动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed to himself when he saw what it was. It was a boat -- or part of a boat anyway. It struck him as funny to see a boat in the middle of this dry and barren wasteland. But after all, he realized, this was once a lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到看清那东西时，他笑了。是一只小船——至少是一部分船的残骸。在这干燥贫瘠的荒原里看到这么一只船，他感到很有意思。但毕竟，他意识到这里曾是一片湖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boat lay upside down, half buried in the dirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小船底朝天地扣在地上，半截埋在土里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey," the thing answered weakly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿。”那东西虚弱地回应了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey!" Stanley shouted, hoping to scare it back inside. His mouth was very dry, and it was hard to shout very loudly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿！”斯坦利大叫，希望把那东西吓回去。他的嘴巴太干了，很难真正大声地喊出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On one side of the boat there was a pile of dirt and then a tunnel leading down below the boat. The tunnel looked big enough for a good-sized animal to crawl through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船的一侧有一堆土，还有一条通往船身下方的通道。那通道大得似乎能让一只个头相当大的动物爬进爬出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then a dark hand and an orange sleeve reached up out of the tunnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随即，一只黑乎乎的手和橙色的衣袖从洞里探了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was coming out.</div>
