<div class="line_en">One summer morning a little tailor was sitting on his table near the window. In good spirits, he was sewing with all his might. A peasant woman came down the street crying, "Good jam for sale! Good jam for sale!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏季一个阳光明媚的早晨，一个小裁缝坐在靠窗的台子旁，竭尽全力地做着手中活儿。这时，街上走来一个农家妇女，边走边吆喝：“买果酱啦！物美价廉呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That sounded good to the little tailor, so he stuck his dainty head out the window and shouted, "Come up here, my dear woman! You can sell your goods here!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman carried her heavy basket up the three flights of stairs to the tailor, who had her unpack all of her jars. He examined them, picking each one up and holding it to his nose. Finally he said, "This jam looks good to me. Weigh out four ounces for me, even if it comes to a quarter pound."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="农妇手提沉甸甸的篮子，跨上台阶，来到小裁缝跟前，按照他的吩咐打开一只又一只的罐子。小裁缝挨个仔细察看，还把罐子举到鼻子跟前闻了又闻，最后才说道：“给我来四盎司，亲爱的太太，半镑也行。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The woman, who had hoped to make a good sale, gave him what he asked for, then went away angry and grumbling.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“愿上帝保佑，”小裁缝嚷嚷道，“这些果酱能给我带来好胃口。” 他从柜子里拿出面包，切了一片下来，把果酱涂在上面。“我心里有数，不会不可口的，”他说，“不过我得先做完这件背心再吃。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey! Who invited you?" said the little tailor, driving away the unbidden guests. However, the flies, who did not understand German, would not be turned away, and they came back in ever-increasing numbers. Finally, losing his temper, he reached for a piece of cloth and shouted, "Wait, now I'm going to give it to you!" then hit at them without mercy. When he backed off and counted, there were no fewer than seven of them lying dead before him, with their legs stretched out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿！谁邀请你的？”小裁缝说，赶走不速之客。然而，那些不懂德语的苍蝇才不会被赶走，反而越来越多。最后，他发脾气，伸手去拿一块布，喊道：“等等，我现在就把它给你！”然后毫不怜悯的打向苍蝇。当他往后退，数着时，只有不到七只躺在他面前，双腿伸直了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aren't you someone?" he said to himself, surprised at his own bravery. the whole town shall hear about this." He hastily cut out a banner for himself, then embroidered on it with large letters, Seven with one blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可真了不起！”他说道，不禁对自己的勇敢大加赞赏，“全城的人都应该知道你的壮举。”说罢，小裁缝风风火火地为自己裁剪了一条横幅，缝好后，在上面绣了几个醒目的大字：“一下子打死七个！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tailor tied the banner around his body and set forth into the world, for he thought that his workshop was too small for such bravery. Before leaving he looked about his house for something that he could take with him. Finding nothing but a piece of old cheese, he put that into his pocket. Outside the town gate he found a bird that was caught in a bush. It went into his pocket with the cheese.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就这个呀？”小裁缝说，“对本人来说，跟玩儿似的。”说着把手伸进口袋里，掏出那快软绵绵的干酪来，轻轻一捏，乳汁就冒了出来。“我更厉害，不是吗？”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="巨人念了起来：“一下子打死七个”。以为这位裁缝一下子打死的是七个人，心里不禁对小裁缝产生几分敬意。不过，他决心要和小裁缝先试试身手，于是，就拣起一快石头来，用手使劲一捏，捏得石头滴出了水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A good throw," said the tailor, "but the stone did fall back to earth. I'll throw one for you that will not come back." He reached into his pocket, pulled out the bird, and threw it into the air.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这和力气有何相干！”小裁缝回答说，“本人一下子能打死七个，你以为我连根小树枝都抓不住吗？林子里有个猎人要朝我开枪，我才急急忙忙跑过树顶。你要是有能耐，跳给我瞧瞧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The giant took hold of the treetop where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it down, and put it into the tailor's hand, inviting him to eat.

<div class="line_cn" title="这太不像话啦！”第一个巨人吼了起来。他疯了一样地从地上一跃而起，把他的同伴朝树上猛地一搡，撞得大树都摇晃起来了。第二个分毫不让，以牙还牙，两个家伙怒不可遏，把一棵棵大树连根拔起，朝着对方猛扔过去，最后他们两败俱伤，都倒在地上死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
