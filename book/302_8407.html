<div class="line_en">He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood toexpect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, bypronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing theword "infection" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer, on her baby's account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from thefirst to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, nowlooked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte'sfears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal withher infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions asidle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to bewithstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hourafter Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her little boy and hisnurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived afew miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, ather earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she wasalmost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long asMarianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; andElinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her betterexperience in nursing, of material use.</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, andfeeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrowwould find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would haveproduced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; foron that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attendedthe whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken theirmother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said wasall in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried toraise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believedherself, that it would be a very short one.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of thepatient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was noamendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanityand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened awayby his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform hispromise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, ColonelBrandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of goinglikewise. -- Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed mostacceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so muchuneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, shethought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that hisstay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him toplay at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with hersister, &amp;c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who wasgratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could notlong even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty waswarmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise MissDashwood in any emergence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，病人的情况几乎没有发生什么变化。病势当然不见好转，但也不显得有所加重。现在，宾主的人数进一步减少了，因为帕尔默先生尽管很不愿走（这一方面是出自真正的仁爱与温厚，一方面是不想显得让妻子吓得不敢不去），但最后终于被布兰登上校说服，准备履行他对妻子的诺言。当他准备动身的时候，布兰登上校更是费尽很大劲儿，才启齿说起自己也想走。不过，好心的詹宁斯太太这时又令人心悦诚服地出面干预了。她认为，上校的情人正为她的妹妹感到焦虑不安，这时候就把他打发走，岂不是叫他们两人都不得安适。因而她立即对上校说，她需要他呆在克利夫兰，逢到晚上达什伍德小姐在楼上陪伴她妹妹时，她要让他和她一起玩皮克牌什么的。她极力挽留他，而他一旦依从就能满足他自己的最高心愿，于是只能装模作样地推托两句。特别是，詹宁斯太太的恳求得到了帕尔默先生的热烈支持，他似乎觉得，他走后留下一个人，碰到紧急情况能帮帮达什伍德小姐的忙，或者替她出出主意，他也就感到宽慰了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Itgave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as itgave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一切安排当然都是背着玛丽安进行的。她不知道，正是因为她的缘故，克利夫兰的主人们才在大家到来大约七天之后，便相继离家而走。她见不到帕尔默夫人并不感到诧异，也不感到关切，她从来不提起她的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and hersituation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, whoattended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, andMiss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the otherswas by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very earlyin the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and ColonelBrandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings'sforebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. Hetried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment ofthe apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each dayin which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for theadmission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from hismind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔默先生走了两天，玛丽安的病情依然如故。哈里斯先生每天都来护理她，仍然一口咬定她很快就会复原。达什伍德小姐同样很乐观，但是其他人却丝毫不感到欢欣鼓舞。詹宁斯太太早在玛丽安刚开始发病不久，就断定她绝对好不了啦。布兰登上校对詹宁斯太太的可怕预言基本上只能听之任之问一答，反复诘难，使对方陷入矛盾，并逐步获得普遍性的，对其影响并无抵制能力。他试图说服自己消除忧虑，医生对病情的不同论断似乎使这种忧虑显得非常荒诞。但是他每天都要孤单单地呆上好多时间，这非常适于他滋生种种伤心的念头，他无法消除再也见不到玛丽安的忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations ofboth were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declaredhis patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and everysymptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmedin every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in herletters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than herfriend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed themat Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be ableto travel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而到了第三天早晨，两人差一点打掉这种悲观心理；因为哈里斯先主来后宣布：病人的情况大有好转。她的脉搏跳动得有力多了，所有症状都比他上次来诊时要好。埃丽诺进一步证实了她的乐观想法，不禁欣喜若狂。使她感到高兴的是，她在写给母亲的信里，一直坚持自己的见解，而没有接受她朋友的判断，对于把她们耽搁在克利夫兰的那点小病完全等闲视之。她几乎确定了玛丽安可以上路的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. -- Towards theevening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, anduncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, waswilling to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue ofhaving sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering thecordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into aslumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Hersleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted aconsiderable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, sheresolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early tobed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreatingherself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone withMarianne.</div>

To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting thelatter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of itsperformance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place byher sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew hewas generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.</div>

Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her nodoubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, herconviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer thecomfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, theearly death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have strucka less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's compassionshe had other claims. She had been for three months her companion, wasstill under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy.

<div class="line_cn" title="到了早晨，詹宁斯太太听说了夜里的情形，不禁大为关切，一再责备她们不该不叫她来帮忙。她先前就感到忧惧，现在更有理由重新感到忧惧，因而对昨晚的事情毫不怀疑，她虽然尽量拿话安慰埃丽诺，但是她深信玛丽安病情危险，安慰中并不夹带着希望。她的心情确实十分悲痛。像玛丽安这么年轻、这么可爱的一个姑娘，居然会迅速垮掉，早早死去，这即使让无关的人见了，也会感到痛惜的。玛丽安还有别的理由得到詹宁斯太太的怜悯。她做了她三个月的同伴，现在仍然受她照顾。大家都知道她受了很大的冤屈，一直不快活。另外，她还眼看着她的姐姐（也是她最宠幸的人）痛苦难熬。至于她们的母亲，詹宁斯太太一想到玛丽安对她大概就像夏洛特对她自己一样，她对她的痛苦的同情就变得非常诚挚了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit; -- but he came to bedisappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. Hismedicines had failed; -- the fever was unabated; and Marianne only morequiet-not more herself-remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catchingall, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call infurther advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still somethingmore to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was asconfident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouragingassurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of MissDashwood. She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but shewas almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering fromone image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spiritsoppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, whoscrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to themany weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointmenthad brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and itgave fresh misery to her reflections.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈里斯先生第二次来得很准时。他指望上次开的药方能产生些效果，但这次来一看，希望落了空。他的药没起作用，烧没有退，玛丽安只是更安静了——这有些反常——一直昏迷不醒。埃丽诺见他害怕了，自己也当即跟着害怕起来，而且害怕得比哈里斯先生有过之而无不及，于是便建议另请医生。可是哈里斯认为这没有必要，他还有点药可以试试。这是一种新药，他相信一定会有效，几乎像他相信前一种药物有效一样。最后，他又做了一番鼓舞人心的保证，可是对于这些保证，达什伍德小姐只是听在耳朵里，心里可不相信。她是镇静的，除了想起她母亲的时候。但是她几乎绝望了，直到中午，她始终处于这种状态，守在妹妹床边几乎一动不动，脑际浮现出一个个悲哀的形象、一个个痛楚的朋友。詹宁斯太太的谈话使她的情绪低沉到极点。这位太太毫无顾忌地把这次剧烈而危险的发作，归咎于玛丽安由于失恋而引起的历时数星期的身体不适。埃丽诺觉得她说的很有道理，因而精神上又增加了新的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About noon, however, she began-but with a caution-a dread ofdisappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to herfriend-to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in hersister's pulse; -- she waited, watched, and examined it again andagain; -- and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury underexterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured tocommunicate her hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend fromindulging a thought of its continuance; -- and Elinor, conning over everyinjunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it wastoo late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxiousflutter, she bent over her sister to watch-she hardly knew for what. Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, allflattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyeson her with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope nowoppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillitytill the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock; -- when his assurances, his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing hisexpectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.</div>

Of breakfast she had beenkept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eatingmuch; -- and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings ofcontent as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jenningswould have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest beforeher mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; butElinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that momentabout her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister anunnecessary instant.

<div class="line_en">The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, andthe rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and thetravellers-they had a rich reward in store, for every presentinconvenience.</div>

The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as thecarriage stopt at the door-of her doubt-her dread-perhaps herdespair! -- and of what SHE had to tell! -- with such knowledge it wasimpossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maidwith her sister, she hurried down stairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have beenconvinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to thehouse; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of theALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved intothe adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to besatisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had notdeceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately inview. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to bedrawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poormother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.</div>
