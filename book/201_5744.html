<div class="line_en">Harry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold win-dowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.</div>

The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question.

An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven.

<div class="line_en">Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive.

He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong -- his reply to Dumbledore's letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Albus Dumbledore," said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. "We have corresponded, of course."

<div class="line_cn" title="“阿不思·邓布利多。”邓布利多看到弗农没有给他作介绍，便说道，“当然啦，我们是通过信的。”哈利觉得，用这种方式提醒佩妮邓布利多曾经给她寄过一封吼叫信，听着有点好笑，但是佩妮姨妈并没有对这种说法表示异议。“这一定是你们的儿子达力吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Madam Rosmerta's finest oak-matured mead," said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely.

Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless.
