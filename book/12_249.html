<div class="line_en">Upon the west of Mordor marched the gloomy range of Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, and upon the north the broken peaks and barren ridges of Ered Lithui, grey as ash. But as these ranges approached one another, being indeed but parts of one great wall about the mournful plains of Lithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the bitter inland sea of Núrnen amidmost, they swung out long arms northward; and between these arms there was a deep defile. This was Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from its mouth were two sheer hills, black-boned and bare. Upon them stood the Teeth of Mordor, two towers strong and tall. In days long past they were built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power, after the overthrow of Sauron and his flight, lest he should seek to return to his old realm. But the strength of Gondor failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers stood empty. Then Sauron returned. Now the watch-towers, which had fallen into decay, were repaired, and filled with arms, and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance. Stony-faced they were, with dark window-holes staring north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards upon the wall, and the patrols before the gate. They lay now peering over the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the outstretched shadow of the northmost buttress of Ephel Dúath. Winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow, maybe, would have flown but a furlong from their hiding-place to the black summit of the nearer tower. A faint smoke curled above it, as if fire smouldered in the hill beneath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两名哈比人绝望地瞪着这两座高塔，即使在这微光中，他们依旧可以看见黑衣黑甲的守卫在塔上不停地梭巡，以及门前络绎不绝的士兵。他们趴在伊菲尔杜斯末端阴影之下的深谷中，观察着眼前的一切变化，如果他们可以化身成乌鸦，大约只要飞行十几尺的距离，就可以抵达其中一座黑塔。塔顶有着缭绕的黑烟，就仿佛山丘中闷烧的火焰一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord had built a rampart of stone. In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored into a hundred caves and maggot-holes; there a host of orcs lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war. None could pass the Teeth of Mordor and not feel their bite, unless they were summoned by Sauron, or knew the secret passwords that would open the Morannon, the black gate of his land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在经过了入口之后，黑暗魔君建造了一座从山崖的一边延伸到另外一边的城墙，在其中，只有一个巨大的铁门，守卫们日夜不停地在其上巡逻。在两旁的山丘之中，也挖掘了无数的隧道和洞穴，成群结队的半兽人就在其中生活，随时准备在一声号令之下蜂拥而出应战。除非来客是应索伦之召前来，或是知道打开黑暗之门的秘语，否则都将被这强大的兵力给团团围住，难以脱逃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Day came, and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of Ered Lithui. Then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in the hills came answering calls; and further still, remote but deep and ominous, there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of Barad-dûr. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor; and the night-guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls, and the day-guards, evil-eyed and fell, were marching to their posts. Steel gleamed dimly on the battlement.</div>

And after all he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed. Now they were come to the bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go to Mordor alone. Sam would go with him -- and at any rate they would get rid of Gollum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆一言不发，佛罗多脸上的神情就已经等于千言万语，他知道再说什么都没有用了。毕竟，从一开始，他就没有对这次的任务抱持任何的希望。不过，身为一名愉快的哈比人，只要绝望不在眼前，他就不需要任何的希望。现在，他们终于必须面对结局，这也是他来的真正目的，当然得要紧跟着主人。他的主人绝不会孤单前往魔多，山姆愿意和他一同前往，至少可以趁机摆脱掉咕鲁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam frowned. If he could have bored holes in Gollum with his eyes, he would have done. His mind was full of doubt. To all appearances Gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help Frodo. But Sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Sméagol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. Sam's guess was that the Sméagol and Gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called Slinker and Stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the Enemy to get the Ring; both wished to keep Frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible -- at any rate as long as Stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his "Precious".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆皱起眉头，如果他的眼神可以在咕鲁身上打洞，那咕鲁早就满身是血了。他的心中充满疑惑，在外表上看起来，咕鲁似乎真心的感到着急，想要帮助佛罗多，但山姆想起了之前所听到的争辩，发现自己很难相信原先一直被压抑的史麦戈，突然间成了强势人格：至少，那声音没有敢在争辩中说最后一句话。山姆推测史麦戈和咕鲁（或者是他心理替他们取的绰号：胆小鬼和肮脏鬼）至少暂时达成了一个共识──两个人都不希望魔王获得魔戒，希望让佛罗多不被抓走，或是在他们的监视下越久越好。反正，时间越久，肮脏鬼就越有机会染指他的“宝贝”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo did not answer Gollum at once. While these doubts were passing through Sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountain-wall. In the midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. By morning-light the roads that converged upon the Gate of Mordor could now be clearly seen, pale and dusty; one winding back northwards; another dwindling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of Ered Lithui; and a third that ran towards him. As it bent sharply round the tower, it entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood. Westward, to his right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains, and went off southwards into the deep shadows that mantled all the western sides of Ephel Dúath; beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and the Great River.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多并没有马上回答咕鲁。在山姆有些迟钝，却十分精明的脑袋中，正在考虑这些事情的时候，他瞪着西力斯葛哥的山崖发呆。他们所躲藏的山谷，是在距离这座山脉之外一段距离的小山丘边缘所形成的一个山谷，在这座山谷中就是西边了望塔的地基。在晨光下，他可以清楚地看见魔多之门前道路会合的地方，一条往北走，另外一条钻入缠绕在伊瑞德力苏山脚底下的浓雾中，第三条则是朝着他；这条路绕过高塔，伸入他脚底下山谷中不远的地方。在他的右手边，也就是西方处，这条路转了个弯，绕过山脚，经过伊菲尔杜斯的西边山崖，在视线的尽头，则是汇入大河和山脉之间的土地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted. "And it's a good thing neither half of the old villain don't know what master means to do," he thought. "If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put an end to his Precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, I bet. Anyhow old Stinker is so frightened of the Enemy -- and he's under orders of some kind from him, or was -- that he'd give us away rather than be caught helping us; and rather than let his Precious be melted, maybe. At least that's my idea. And I hope the master will think it out carefully. He's as wise as any, but he's soft-hearted, that's what he is. It's beyond any Gamgee to guess what he'll do next."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆很怀疑，究竟有没有什么通往魔多的另一条路，他心中暗自嘀咕：“幸好这臭家伙的两半人格，都不知道主人的目地是什么，”他想：“如果他知道佛罗多先生准备永远地摧毁他的宝贝，这家伙一定会拼命的。反正，肮脏鬼很害怕魔王，似乎接受了他的什么命令，他宁愿检举我们，也不愿被发现正在帮助我们，当然，更不可能让他的宝贝被融化掉。至少，这是我的看法，我希望主人可以仔细地想一想。他比大多数人都要聪明，但心肠太软了些。我实在猜不出来他下一步会怎么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the march, though for the most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets; and over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many companies. He remembered his vision from afar upon Amon Hen, so few days before, though now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that had for one wild moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by the men of Gondor, risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long passed away. These were Men of other race, out of the wide Eastlands, gathering to the summons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before his Gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power. As if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of their position, alone, in the growing light of day, so near to this vast menace, Frodo quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then he turned to Gollum.</div>

Do not say that again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will never get it back. But the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. In the last need, Sméagol, I should put on the Precious; and the Precious mastered you long ago.

<div class="line_en">Sam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. It had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. Of course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and of Gandalf). Gollum in his own way, and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was much briefer, may have made a similar mistake, confusing kindness and blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆欣慰地看着主人，但同时也感到些许的惊讶，他脸上的表情和声调，都是之前山姆从来没有见到过的。他以前一直以为佛罗多这么好心肠的人，一定有些见识不清的地方（老比尔博和甘道夫或许是两个例外）。咕鲁由于和主人并没有相处太久，因此也可能犯了相同的错误，将体贴和盲目混为一谈。无论如何，这段说词在他身上发挥了极大的效果，他趴在地面上，只能口齿不清地喃喃念着好主人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Gollum was in a pitiable state, and Frodo's threat had quite unnerved him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged them both to be kind to "poor little Sméagol". After a while he grew a little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the road that turned west of Ephel Dúath, he would come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees. On the right a road went down to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went on southwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，咕鲁似乎吓得失了神，佛罗多的威胁让他感到非常害怕，你很难从他口中含糊不清的话语中，搞清楚他到底要说些什么，而且，他之间还会常常趴在地上，哀求着两人要对“可怜的小史麦戈”好一点。过了一阵子之后，他好不容易比较冷静了些，佛罗多才勉强从他的自言自语中了解了个大概。如果旅客沿着在伊菲尔杜斯往西边转的那条路前进，他最后会来到一条位于一圈黑暗树木之中的十字路口，在右边有条路通往奥斯吉力亚斯以及越过安都因河的大桥；十字路口的中央，还会有一条路一直往南方延伸。">查看中文翻译</div>

Indeed Gandalf's guidance had been taken from them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away. How they should enter it at the last Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could not say. Into the stronghold of the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he had once ventured. But into Mordor, to the Mountain of Fire and to Barad-dûr, since the Dark Lord rose in power again, had he ever journeyed there? Frodo did not think so. And here he was a little halfling from the Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside, expected to find a way where the great ones could not go, or dared not go. It was an evil fate. But he had taken it on himself in his own sitting-room in the far-off spring of another year, so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the world's youth, when the Trees of Silver and Gold were still in bloom.

<div class="line_cn" title="即使是在太阳之下飞翔的苍鹰，也无法发现这两名背负着末日的压力，一言不发地披着灰色斗篷坐在山谷中的哈比人；或许，它可能会停下来仔细观察咕鲁，一个趴在地上的小生物；或许那是某种人类小孩的骨骸，身上依旧挂着残破的衣物，细长的手臂和脚几乎是白色的，看来一点肉也没有，不值得啄食。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo's head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands behind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky. At least for a long while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a dark bird-like figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and then wheel away again. Two more followed, and then a fourth. They were very small to look at, yet he knew, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of pinion, flying at a great height. He covered his eyes and bent forward, cowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of the Black Riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: the menace was more remote. But menace it was. Frodo felt it too. His thought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. Gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled, and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to Mordor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多的头靠在膝盖上，山姆则是双手交迭在背后，躺了回去，茫然瞪着空旷的天空，至少，暂时是空旷的。然后，山姆觉得自己似乎看见了一个黑色的鸟形生物飞进他的视线，翱翔了片刻，然后又飞向另外一个方向；接着是另外两只，然后又有第四只…它们看起来都非常小，但是，他依旧可以感觉到对方的体型其实是相当庞大的，拥有极宽的翼展，飞翔在极高的穹苍下。他遮住眼睛，弯身向前，这是和他们感到黑骑士存在时同样的压迫感和恐惧感，和风中传来嘶吼声、以及月亮被阴影所遮蔽时是一样的感觉，只不过，这次的威胁感更遥远了些，但这依旧是种威胁，佛罗多也感觉到了。他的思绪被打断了，他扭动着身体，忍不住发抖，但并没有抬头；咕鲁缩成一团，像是被逼到角落的蜘蛛一样。那些长着翅膀的生物盘旋着，接着一阵俯冲，飞快地回到魔多去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding silence was broken. For some time they had been cut off from the world, as if in an invisible island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned. But still Frodo did not speak to Gollum or make his choice. His eyes were closed, as if he were dreaming, or looking inward into his heart and memory. At last he stirred and stood up, and it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide. But "hark!" he said. "What is that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐惧的感觉消退了，但那笼罩的沉寂却被打破了。他们之前似乎与世隔绝，身处在孤绝的海岛上，但现在他们再度暴露在敌人眼前，危机又再度出现。但佛罗多依旧不和咕鲁说话，也不明说他的抉择。他闭着眼，仿佛在作梦，或是仔细地回顾过去的所有回忆。最后，他站了起来，似乎已经作出选择，准备开口了。但是刹那间，“什么！”他说：“那是什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A new fear was upon them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At first it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these terrible servants of Sauron. They crouched, listening. The voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close. Frodo and Sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新的恐惧降临。他们听见歌声和粗鲁的吼叫声。一开始看起来似乎是从遥远的地方传来的，但那声音越来越近，正朝着他们走来。他们心中浮起的念头是：那些黑色的巨鸟看见了他们，派出武装的士兵来搜捕他们，索伦的恐怖仆人向来是以速度着称。他们躲了起来，倾听着一切，人声和武器的撞击声以及马蹄声都十分靠近。佛罗多和山姆将武器微微出鞘，这次已经无路可逃了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam took a deep breath. "The Riders are about again, up in the air," he said in a hoarse whisper. "I saw them. Do you think they could see us? They were very high up. And if they are Black Riders, same as before, then they can't see much by daylight, can they?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, perhaps not," said Frodo. "But their steeds could see. And these winged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably see more than any other creature. They are like great carrion birds. They are looking for something: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，或许什么都看不到，”佛罗多说：“但他们的座骑却可能被看见，而且这些长着翅膀的生物，多半比世界上其它生物看得都要远。他们就像是吃腐肉的大型鸟类一样，他们在寻找着某些东西，我猜魔王已经提高了警觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it between two broken points of stone. He remained there without moving for some time, making no sound. Presently the voices began to recede again, and then they slowly faded away. Far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the Morannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁缓缓地爬起来，像是只昆虫一样地爬到坑洞边，他小心地一寸一寸伸出脖子，直到他可以透过两块岩石间的空隙往外看。他保持不动，一声不出地看了一阵子，目前，那声音已经开始消退了，慢慢地变弱。远处魔多大门之上又传来了号角声，然后，咕鲁悄悄地溜回坑洞中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"More Men going to Mordor," he said in a low voice. "Dark faces. We have not seen Men like these before, no, Sméagol has not. They are fierce. They have black eyes, and long black hair, and gold rings in their ears; yes, lots of beautiful gold. And some have red paint on their cheeks, and red cloaks; and their flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they have round shields, yellow and black with big spikes. Not nice; very cruel wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Orcs, and much bigger. Sméagol thinks they have come out of the South beyond the Great River's end: they came up that road. They have passed on to the Black Gate; but more may follow. Always more people coming to Mordor. One day all the peoples will be inside."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That," said Sam, when he had finished reciting, "that's a rhyme we have in the Shire. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too, and news out of the South, you know. In the old days hobbits used to go on their travels now and again. Not that many ever came back, and not that all they said was believed: news from Bree, and not sure as Shiretalk, as the sayings go. But I've heard tales of the big folk down away in the Sunlands. Swertings we call 'em in our tales; and they ride on oliphaunts, "tis said, when they fight. They put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and all, and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another. So when you said 'Men out of the South, all in red and gold,' I said 'were there any oliphaunts?' For if there was, I was going to take a look, risk or no. But now I don't suppose I'll ever see an oliphaunt. Maybe there ain't no such a beast." He sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那，”山姆在念完诗之后说：“那是我们在夏尔念的一首诗。或许只是乱掰的，或许不是，不过，我们自古就有关于南方的传说和故事喔。在古代，哈比人经常四处游历，没有多少人回来，也没有多少人相信他们说的话：所谓的‘夏尔之谈’和‘布理的消息’就是这么来的。但是我曾经听说过有关那些在日之地的大家伙的传说。我们在故事中叫他们做史卧丁人，当他们作战的时候他们会骑猛，据说他们会把屋子和高塔放在猛的背上，而那些猛会对彼此丢掷石块和大树。所以当你提到‘南方人，穿着红色衣服戴着黄金’的时候，我自然会问‘有没有猛？’因为如果真有的话，我一定要冒险看一看。唉，现在看来，我想我这辈子都没机会看见猛了，或许这世界上没有这种动物。”他叹气道。">查看中文翻译</div>
