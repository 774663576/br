<div class="line_en">The national press was also struck with wonder at Minister Trezza's genius on the organization of the special five thousand-man army. The army would be made up of bachelors so there would be no widows, and so their families could not be subjected to threats. There would be commandos, paratroopers, armored cars, heavy weapons and even aircraft. How could any two-penny bandit withstand such a force? And it would be commanded by Colonel Ugo Luca, one of the great Italian war heroes of World War II, who had fought with the legendary German general Rommel. The "Italian Desert Fox" the newspapers called him, skilled in guerrilla warfare, whose tactics and strategies would bewilder the unsophisticated Sicilian country boy, Turi Guiliano.</div>

<div class="line_en">In July of 1949 Minister Trezza announced to the press the formation of a special carabinieri army of five thousand men to be called the Special Force to Repress Banditry, without any reference to Guiliano himself.

<div class="line_en">Before doing anything else, Colonel Luca studied all the intelligence documents on Turi Guiliano. Minister Trezza found him tucked in his office surrounded by folders full of reports and old newspapers. When the Minister asked him when he was taking his army to Sicily, the Colonel said mildly that he was assembling a staff, and that certainly Guiliano would still be there no matter how long he took.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢卡上校所做的第一件事就是仔细研究有关图里·吉里安诺的所有情报资料。特雷扎部长发现卢卡上校把自己关在办公室里，身边堆着许多文件夹，里面有各种报告和旧剪报资料。部长问他准备什么时候带兵去西西里，他语气温和地说他准备组建一个参谋班子，并且说不管这要用多长时间，吉里安诺肯定还会在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Colonel Ugo Luca, the designated Commander of the Special Force to Repress Banditry, was hailed by the newspapers as an inspired choice. They hashed over his military record, his medals for bravery, his tactical genius, his quiet and retiring nature, and his abhorrence of any kind of failure. He was a small bulldog, the newspapers said, and would be a match for the ferocity of Sicily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="报纸称赞任命乌戈·卢卡上校为剿匪特种部队司令是一个让人振奋的选择。报上仔细介绍了他的军旅生涯、他的英勇军功、他的战术才干、他稳重孤僻的个性以及他对失败的憎恶。报上说他是一只凶猛的小斗牛犬，是对付西西里暴行的克星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Colonel Luca studied the reports for a week and came to certain conclusions. That Guiliano was a genius in guerrilla warfare and had a unique method of operation. He kept only a cadre of twenty men about his person, and these included his chiefs: Aspanu Pisciotta as his second in command, Canio Silvestro as his personal bodyguard and Stefano Andolini as chief of intelligence and his contact messenger to Don Croce and Mafia networks. Terranova and Passatempo had their own bands and were allowed to operate independently of Guiliano's direct command unless there was a concerted action. Terranova carried out Guiliano's kidnappings and Passatempo the train and bank holdups that Guiliano planned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢卡上校用一个星期时间研究那些报告并得出了自己的结论：吉里安诺在游击战方面是个天才，有一套独特的作战方法。他只让二十名干部跟在身边，其中包括他的几个头领——他的副手阿斯帕努·皮肖塔，他的贴身保镖卡尼奥·西尔韦斯特罗，还有主管情报工作、负责与唐·克罗切及黑手党网络进行联络的斯特凡·安多里尼。泰拉诺瓦和帕萨藤珀有自己的一伙人，在没有联合行动的情况下，他们可以独立行动，不受吉里安诺的直接指挥。泰拉诺瓦负责执行绑架计划，帕萨藤珀专门抢劫火车和银行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, there was another puzzling thing: Guiliano's cloak of invisibility. He appeared at one place and then seemed to vanish into thin air. The more Colonel Luca read, the more he was impressed. Then he came to something he knew he could take immediate action against. It might look like nothing much, but it would be important in the long run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后还有一件事他不明白：吉里安诺神出鬼没。他在一个地方出现，接着就好像蒸发了似的消失得无影无踪。卢卡上校越看越有兴趣。接着他发现有件事他可以马上采取行动来对付。也许这件事看起来微不足道，但从长远来看却至关重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It became clear to the Colonel that there were no more than three hundred men in the whole Guiliano band. Then how, the Colonel wondered, had he existed for six years, how had he outfought the carabinieri of an entire province and almost absolutely controlled the entire northwest of Sicily? How had he and his men escaped searches of the mountains by large government forces? It could only be that Guiliano summoned up extra men from among the peasants of Sicily whenever he needed them. And then when the government searched the mountains, these part-time bandits would escape into the towns and farms to live like ordinary peasants. It also followed that many of the citizens of the town of Montelepre had to be secret members of the band. But most important was Guiliano's popularity; there was little chance that he would ever be betrayed, and there was no doubt that if he made an open call to revolution, thousands would flock beneath his banner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上校清楚地看出，吉里安诺的组织最多不会超过三百人。但是他不明白吉里安诺怎么能存在六年，怎么能够打败当地的宪兵、几乎完全控制了西西里的西北部？他和他的手下人怎么能躲过大批政府武装力量的搜山？唯一的可能就是：吉里安诺在有需要的时候从西西里的农民中招募了额外数量的人。当政府搜山的时候，这些业余土匪就会躲到镇上和农场里，像普通农民那样生活。这样看来，蒙特莱普雷镇的许多居民也是这支武装的秘密成员。但最重要的是吉里安诺深得民心；他被人出卖的可能性微乎其微。毫无疑问，如果他公开号召革命，就会有数以千计的人啸聚在他的大旗之下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano had often written letters to the press that always began, "If, as I have been led to believe, we are not enemies, you will publish this letter," and then went on to present his point of view on his latest acts of banditry. To Colonel Luca's mind that opening phrase was a threat, a coercion. And the body of the letter was enemy propaganda. There were explanations of kidnappings, of robberies and how the money went to the poor of Sicily. When Guiliano had a pitched battle with the carabinieri and killed some of them, a letter was always sent to explain that in war soldiers had to die. There was a direct plea to the carabinieri not to fight. And another letter came after the execution of the six Mafia chiefs, explaining that only by that deed could the peasants claim the land due to them by law and human morality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺经常给报纸写信，信的开头总是：“你们一直想让我相信我们不是敌人，如果真是这样，你们就会把这封信公之于世。”接着他就针对他近期的土匪行为大放厥词。在卢卡上校看来，开头那句话是一种威胁、一种强迫。信的内容是敌人的宣传。信上解释了绑架、抢劫的原因，以及那些钱是怎样分给西西里穷人的。当吉里安诺与宪兵发生激战，并打死一些人的时候，他总要发出一封信，解释说在战争中军人的死亡是不可避免的。他会直接呼吁宪兵不要作战。还有一封信是在杀了六个黑手党首领之后写的，信上解释说，只有那样做农民才能得到法律和道德赋予他们的土地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Colonel Luca was astounded that the government had allowed these letters to be published. He made a note to ask Minister Trezza for the power of martial law in Sicily so that Guiliano could be cut off from his public.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another thing he searched for was any information that Guiliano had a woman, but he could find nothing. Though there were reports that the bandits used the brothels in Palermo and that Pisciotta was a womanizer, Guiliano seemed to have lived a sexless life for the last six years. Colonel Luca, being an Italian, could not believe this possible. There must be a woman in Montelepre, and when they found her half the job would be done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他寻找的另一个信息就是吉里安诺有没有相好的女人，不过他一无所获。虽然有报告说土匪去巴勒莫逛妓院，还说皮肖塔是个玩女人的高手，而在过去六年中吉里安诺过的却是一种无性的生活。作为一个意大利人，卢卡上校认为这是不可能的，他在蒙特莱普雷肯定有个女人，只要找到她，大功的一半就告成了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When all this preparation was over, Colonel Luca organized his staff. The most important appointment was Captain Antonio Perenze as his aide-de-camp and personal bodyguard. Captain Perenze was a heavy, almost fat, man with genial features and an easy disposition, but Colonel Luca knew him to be extraordinarily brave. There might come a time when that bravery could save the Colonel's life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当这些准备工作做完之后，卢卡上校组建了一套参谋班子。最重要的安排是任命安东尼奥·佩伦兹上尉做他的副官兼侍卫。佩伦兹上尉身材魁梧，体型偏胖，慈眉善目，性情随和。但是卢卡上校知道他特别勇敢，说不定将来能救他一命也未可知。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What he also found interesting was the record of Guiliano's attachment to his mother and hers to him. Guiliano was a devoted son to both parents, but he treated his mother with a special veneration. Colonel Luca made a particular note of this too. If Guiliano really had no woman, the mother could be used to bait a trap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还发现一件有趣的事情：吉里安诺和他的母亲之间有着深厚的依恋。吉里安诺对父母双亲都很孝顺，但对母亲却特别尊敬。卢卡上校特别记住了这一点。如果吉里安诺真的没有女人，他们就可以利用他母亲布设诱捕他的陷阱。">查看中文翻译</div>

The next was to arrest and detain for questioning over two hundred men in Montelepre on charges that they were secret members of Guiliano's band. All those arrested were transported to jails in Palermo that were heavily guarded by Colonel Luca's men. All these actions were taken under laws from the Fascist regime of Mussolini still on the books.</div>

<div class="line_en">The payroll caravan left Palermo early in the morning and made its first stop at the small town of Tommaso Natale. From there it swung onto the mountainous road to Montelepre. The paymaster and his guards knew it would be a long day and they drove quickly. They ate pieces of salami and chunks of bread and drank wine from botttles as they rode. They joked and laughed and the drivers of the lead jeeps put their weapons down on the floors of their vehicles. But when the caravan rode over the top of the last hill that led down into Montelepre, they were amazed to see the road ahead filled with a vast flock of sheep. The jeeps leading the column made their way into the flock, and the guards shouted at the roughly clothed shepherds. The soldiers were anxious to get inside the cool barracks and eat a hot meal, to strip to their underwear and loll in the beds or play cards for their noon hour break. There could be no danger; Montelepre, only a few miles away, had a garrison of five hundred men of Colonel Luca's army. Behind them, they could see the truck carrying the payroll enter the vast sea of sheep but did not see that it had become becalmed there, that no path opened up for it.</div>

When this truck stuffed with millions of lire left Palermo, it was preceded by three scout jeeps, each with mounted machine guns and four men, and a troop carrier holding twenty men heavily armed with machine pistols and rifles. Behind the money truck came two command cars, each with six men. All these vehicles had radio communication to call Palermo or the nearest carabinieri barracks for reinforcements.

By turning ninety degrees he could also see the battle in the streets of the town, the direct attack on the Bellampo Barracks and the engagement of carabinieri patrols on the coastal roads. All his chiefs were functioning perfectly. Passatempo and his men had the money from the payroll, Pisciotta had the rear of the carabinieri column immobilized, Terranova and his band, supplemented by new recruits, had attacked the Bellampo Barracks and engaged their patrols. The men directly under Guiliano commanded the bases of the mountain. And Stefano Andolini, truly a Fra Diavalo, was preparing a surprise.</div>

Armored cars went ahead, followed by the bulletproof car that carried Colonel Luca and Inspector Federico Velardi, who had insisted on going to help identify the body but really to make sure the body did not carry the Testament. Behind Luca's car were troop carriers with men at the alert, weapons ready to fire. Scout jeeps to the number of twenty, filled with armed paratroopers, preceded the column.

It had been a trap after all, Guiliano must have hoped that the Colonel would rush to the scene with a small escort and lay himself open to ambush. Colonel Luca ordered all precautions to be taken, but he was in a hurry to start on the road back to Palermo and get to his headquarters; he wanted to report personally to Rome what had happened that day and also make sure no one had released the false report of Guiliano's death.
