<div class="line_en">Baba gave me two presents. One was sure to become the envy of every kid in the neighborhood: a brand new Schwinn Stingray, the king of all bicycles. Only a handful of kids in all of Kabul owned a new Stingray and now I was one of them. It had high-rise handlebars with black rubber grips and its famous banana seat. The spokes were gold colored and the steel-frame body red, like a candy apple. Or blood. Any other kid would have hopped on the bike immediately and taken it for a full block skid. I might have done the same a few months ago.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting in the middle of my room the next morning, I ripped open box after box of presents. I don't know why I even bothered, since I just gave them a joyless glance and pitched them to the corner of the room. The pile was growing there: a Polaroid camera, a transistor radio, an elaborate electric train set -- and several sealed envelopes containing cash. I knew I'd never spend the money or listen to the radio, and the electric train would never trundle down its tracks in my room. I didn't want any of it -- it was all blood money; Baba would have never thrown me a party like that if I hadn't won the tournament.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔日清早，我坐在房间中间，拆开一个又一个礼品盒子。我不知道自己为何如此费劲，因为我总是兴味索然地看上一眼，就将礼物丢到屋角去。它们在那边积成一堆：宝丽莱相机，变频收音机，精巧的电动列车组合玩具——还有几个装着现金的信封。我知道自己永远不会花那些钱，不会听那个收音机，而那辆电动列车也不会在我房间中爬上它的轨道。我不想要这些东西——这些全都是血腥钱；而且，若非我赢得风筝大赛，爸爸根本就不会替我举办那么一场宴会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们可以去骑骑。”爸爸说。他在邀请我，不过并非真心实意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other present Baba gave me -- and he didn't wait around for me to open this one -- was a wristwatch. It had a blue face with gold hands in the shape of lightning bolts. I didn't even try it on. I tossed it on the pile of toys in the corner. The only gift I didn't toss on that mound was Rahim Khan's leather-bound notebook. That was the only one that didn't feel like blood money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸给我的另一件礼物——他甚至不愿意等我打开它——是手表。表面是蓝色的，金色的指针呈闪电状。我甚至都没试着戴一下，就将其扔到角落那堆玩具中去。惟一没有被扔到那堆东西里去的礼物是拉辛汗的皮面笔记本，只有它不像是血腥钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sat on the edge of my bed, turned the notebook in my hands, thought about what Rahim Khan had said about Homaira, how his father's dismissing her had been for the best in the end. She would have suffered. Like the times Kaka Homayoun's projector got stuck on the same slide, the same image kept flashing in my mind over and over: Hassan, his head downcast, serving drinks to Assef and Wali. Maybe it would be for the best. Lessen his suffering. And mine too. Either way, this much had become clear: One of us had to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐在自己的床沿，双手打开笔记本，想着拉辛汗提起荷麦拉的故事，被他父亲逐走是她最好的下场。她会受苦的。好比霍玛勇叔叔的投影机被同一面幻灯片卡住，总有个画面在我脑中挥之不去：哈桑，他低着头，端饮料服侍阿塞夫和瓦里。兴许那是最好的结局，既可减少他的伤痛，也可缓和我的苦楚。不管怎样，事情变得清楚起来：我们有一个必须离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Salaam, All," I said, waving back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好，阿里。”我挥着手说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later that afternoon, I took the Schwinn for its first and last spin. I pedaled around the block a couple of times and came back. I rolled up the driveway to the backyard where Hassan and Ali were cleaning up the mess from last night's party. Paper cups, crumpled napkins, and empty bottles of soda littered the yard. Ali was folding chairs, setting them along the wall. He saw me and waved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天午后，我第一次，也是最后一次骑上那辆施温自行车。我绕着那个街区骑了好几圈，然后回家。我骑上那条车道，通向后院，哈桑和阿里正在那儿打扫昨夜宴会留下的一片狼藉。院子里到处是纸杯、揉成一团的纸巾，还有空空如也的汽水瓶。阿里正把椅子折叠起来，放到墙边去。他看见我，招招手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He held up a finger, asking me to wait, and walked to his living quarters. A moment later, he emerged with something in his hands. "The opportunity never presented itself last night for Hassan and me to give you this," he said, handing me a box. "It's mod est and not worthy of you, Amir agha. But we hope you like it still. Happy birthday."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他举起一只手指，让我稍等，接着走进他住那间屋子。片刻之后，他手里拿着某些东西走出来。“昨晚我和哈桑找不到机会把这份礼物给你，”他说着交给我一个盒子，“它太普通，配不上你，阿米尔少爷。不过我们还是希望你喜欢它。生日快乐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A lump was rising in my throat. "Thank you, Ali," I said. I wished they hadn't bought me anything. I opened the box and found a brand new _Shahnamah_, a hardback with glossy colored illustrations beneath the passages. Here was Ferangis gazing at her newborn son, Kai Khosrau. There was Afrasiyab riding his horse, sword drawn, leading his army. And, of course, Rostam inflicting a mortal wound onto his son, the warrior Sohrab. "It's beautiful," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喉咙一哽。“谢谢你，阿里。”我说。我宁愿他们什么也没给我买。我打开盒子，看到一本崭新的《沙纳玛》，硬皮的，每页的下方附有精美的彩色插图。这张是菲兰吉凝望她刚出世的儿子凯寇斯劳；那张是阿佛拉西雅手执利剑，胯骑骏马，领军前进。当然还有罗斯坦给他儿子，勇士索拉博以致命一击。“真漂亮。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's lovely," I said. And it was. And, I suspected, not inexpensive either. I wanted to tell Ali it was not the book, but I who was unworthy. I hopped back on the bicycle. "Thank Hassan for me," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它很可爱。”我说。确实很可爱。甚至也不便宜，我怀疑。我想告诉阿里，书没有配不上我，是我配不上他们的礼物。我重新跳上那辆自行车。“替我谢谢哈桑。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">THE NEXT MORNING, I waited in my room for Ali to clear the breakfast table in the kitchen. Waited for him to do the dishes, wipe the counters. I looked out my bedroom window and waited until Ali and Hassan went grocery shopping to the bazaar, pushing the empty wheelbarrows in front of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="翌日清早，我在房间里等着阿里清理完厨房用过早餐的桌子。等着他把盘碗洗好，把灶台抹净。我倚窗等着，直到望见阿里和哈桑推着那辆空的独轮车，到市场去购买杂货。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hassan said your copy was old and ragged, and that some of the pages were missing," Ali said. "All the pictures are hand-drawn in this one with pen and ink," he added proudly, eyeing a book neither he nor his son could read.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈桑说你那本又旧又破，还掉了一些书页。”阿里说，“这本书里面全部图画都是用钢笔和墨水手绘的。”他骄傲地补充说，望着这本他和他的儿子都看不懂的书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ended up tossing the book on the heap of gifts in the corner of my room. But my eyes kept going back to it, so I buried it at the bottom. Before I went to bed that night, I asked Baba if he'd seen my new watch anywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我终究将这本书扔在屋角那堆礼物上面。可是我的眼睛总是忍不住看向它，所以我将它埋在下面。那夜睡觉之前，我问爸爸有没有看到我的新手表。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I took a couple of the envelopes of cash from the pile of gifts and my watch, and tiptoed out. I paused before Baba's study and listened in. He'd been in there all morning, making phone calls. He was talking to someone now, about a shipment of rugs due to arrive next week. I went downstairs, crossed the yard, and entered Ali and Hassan's living quarters by the loquat tree. I lifted Hassan's mattress and planted my new watch and a handful of Afghani bills under it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，我从那堆礼物中拣起数个装着钞票的信封和那个手表，蹑手蹑脚走出去。路过爸爸书房时，我停下来听听动静。整个早上他都在那儿打电话，现在他正跟某人说话，有一批地毯预计下星期到达。我走下楼梯，穿过院子，从枇杷树后进入阿里和哈桑的房间。我掀起哈桑的毛毯，将新手表和一把阿富汗尼钞票塞在下面。">查看中文翻译</div>

Baba came back to the house; Ali followed Hassan to their hut.</div>

<div class="line_en">I flinched, like I'd been slapped. My heart sank and I almost blurted out the truth. Then I understood: This was Hassan's final sacrifice for me. If he'd said no, Baba would have believed him because we all knew Hassan never lied. And if Baba believed him, then I'd be the accused; I would have to explain and I would be revealed for what I really was. Baba would never, ever forgive me. And that led to another understanding: Hassan knew He knew I'd seen everything in that alley, that I'd stood there and done nothing. He knew I had betrayed him and yet he was rescuing me once again, maybe for the last time. I loved him in that moment, loved him more than I'd ever loved anyone, and I wanted to tell them all that I was the snake in the grass, the monster in the lake. I wasn't worthy of this sacrifice; I was a liar, a cheat, and a thief. And I would have told, except that a part of me was glad. Glad that this would all be over with soon. Baba would dismiss them, there would be some pain, but life would move on. I wanted that, to move on, to forget, to start with a clean slate. I wanted to be able to breathe again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我身体紧缩，好似被人扇了个耳光。我的心一沉，真话差点脱口而出。我随即明白：这是哈桑最后一次为我牺牲。如果他说“不是”，爸爸肯定相信，因为我们都知道哈桑从来不骗人。若爸爸相信他，那么矛头就转向我了，我不得不辩解，我的真面目终究会被看穿，爸爸将永远永远不会原谅我。这让我明白了另外的事情：哈桑知道。他知道我看到了小巷里面的一切，知道我站在那儿，袖手旁观。他明知我背叛了他，然而还是再次救了我，也许是最后一次。那一刻我爱上了他，爱他胜过爱任何人，我只想告诉他们，我就是草丛里面的毒蛇，湖底的鬼怪。我不配他作出的牺牲，我是撒谎蛋，我是骗子，我是小偷。我几乎就要说出来，若非心里隐隐有高兴的念头。高兴是因为这一切很快就要终结了，爸爸会赶走他们，也许会有些痛苦，但生活会继续。那是我所想要的，要继续生活，要遗忘，要将过去一笔勾销，从头来过。我想要能重新呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Forgive? But theft was the one unforgivable sin, the common denominator of all sins. When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife's right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. There is no act more wretched than stealing. Hadn't Baba sat me on his lap and said those words to me? Then how could he just forgive Hassan? And if Baba could forgive that, then why couldn't he forgive me for not being the son he'd always wanted? Why --</div>

It was a protective gesture and I knew whom Ali was protecting him from. Ali glanced my way and in his cold, unforgiving look, I saw that Hassan had told him. He had told him everything, about what Assef and his friends had done to him, about the kite, about me. Strangely, I was glad that someone knew me for who I really was; I was tired of pretending.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不可能在这里过日子了，老爷。我们要走了。”阿里把哈桑拉到身旁，伸臂环住他儿子的肩膀。这是个保护的动作，我知道阿里对哈桑的保护是在抵御什么人的伤害。阿里朝我瞟来，带着冷冷的、不可谅解的眼神，我明白哈桑告诉他了。他把一切都告诉他了，关于阿塞夫和他的朋友对他所做的事情，关于那只风筝，关于我。奇怪的是，我很高兴终于有人识破我的真面目，我装得太累了。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Please," Baba was saying, but Ali had already turned to the door, Hassan trailing him. I'll never forget the way Baba said that, the pain in his plea, the fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我看到爸爸做了我之前从未见过的事情：号啕大哭。见到大人哭泣，我被吓了一跳。我从未想到爸爸也会哭。“求求你。”爸爸说。可是阿里已经走到门口，哈桑跟在他后面。我永远不会忘记爸爸说出那话的神情，那哀求中透露的痛苦，还有恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">IN KABUL, it rarely rained in the summer. Blue skies stood tall and far, the sun like a branding iron searing the back of your neck. Creeks where Hassan and I skipped stones all spring turned dry, and rickshaws stirred dust when they sputtered by. People went to mosques for their ten raka'ts of noontime prayer and then retreated to whatever shade they could find to nap in, waiting for the cool of early evening. Summer meant long school days sweating in tightly packed, poorly ventilated classrooms learning to recite ayats from the Koran, struggling with those tongue-twisting, exotic Arabic words. It meant catching flies in your palm while the mullah droned on and a hot breeze brought with it the smell of shit from the outhouse across the schoolyard, churning dust around the lone rickety basketball hoop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喀布尔的夏天罕得下雨，天空一碧如洗，阳光像烙铁般灼痛后颈。整个春天我和哈桑在溪流打水漂，到得夏天它们也干涸了。黄包车嗒嗒走过，扬起阵阵灰尘。午间祈祷时分，人们到清真寺去行十次“晌礼”，跟着随便找个荫凉的地方躲进去，等待傍晚的凉意。夏天意味着漫长的学校生活，坐在密不透风的拥挤教室里面，浑身大汗地学着背诵《可兰经》的经文，和那些饶舌而奇怪的阿拉伯单词作斗争；夏天意味着听毛拉念念有词，用手掌拍死苍蝇；意味着一阵和风吹过，带来操场那边厕所的粪便气味，在那形影相吊的歪斜篮球架旁边吹起尘雾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba had offered to drive them to Bamiyan himself, but Ali refused. Through the blurry, rain-soaked window of my bedroom, I watched Ali haul the lone suitcase carrying all of their belongings to Baba's car idling outside the gates. Hassan lugged his mattress, rolled tightly and tied with a rope, on his back. He'd left all of his toys behind in the empty shack -- I discovered them the next day, piled in a corner just like the birthday presents in my room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸本来要亲自送他们到巴米扬，但阿里拒绝了。透过我的卧房那扇被雨水湿透的模糊窗户，我看见阿里拖着个孤零零的箱子，里面装着他们全副身家，走向爸爸停在大门外的轿车。哈桑的毯子紧紧卷起来，用绳子系住，背在他身后。他把所有的玩具都留在那间四壁萧然的斗室了，隔天我发现它们堆在屋角，如同我房间里面的生日礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it rained the afternoon Baba took Ali and Hassan to the bus station. Thunderheads rolled in, painted the sky iron gray. Within minutes, sheets of rain were sweeping in, the steady hiss of falling water swelling in my ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但爸爸送阿里和哈桑去车站那天下午，天下雨了。雷轰电闪，天空灰沉沉的。顷刻之间，大雨倾盆而至，哗哗的雨声在我耳边回荡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stepped back and all I saw was rain through windowpanes that looked like melting silver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我退后，眼里只见到玻璃窗外的雨水，看上去好像熔化的白银。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slithering beads of rain sluiced down my window. I saw Baba slam the trunk shut. Already drenched, he walked to the driver's side. Leaned in and said something to Ali in the backseat, perhaps one last-ditch effort to change his mind. They talked that way awhile, Baba getting soaked, stooping, one arm on the roof of the car. But when he straightened, I saw in his slumping shoulders that the life I had known since I'd been born was over. Baba slid in. The headlights came on and cut twin funnels of light in the rain. If this were one of the Hindi movies Hassan and I used to watch, this was the part where I'd run outside, my bare feet splashing rainwater. I'd chase the car, screaming for it to stop. I'd pull Hassan out of the backseat and tell him I was sorry, so sorry, my tears mixing with rainwater. We'd hug in the downpour. But this was no Hindi movie. I was sorry, but I didn't cry and I didn't chase the car. I watched Baba's car pull away from the curb, taking with it the person whose first spoken word had been my name. I caught one final blurry glimpse of Hassan slumped in the back seat before Baba turned left at the street corner where we'd played marbles so many times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨珠刷刷流下我的窗户。我看见爸爸将行李厢的门摔上。他浑身湿透，走向驾驶座那边，斜倚着身子，向后座的阿里说些什么，也许是作最后的努力，以便让他回心转意。他们那样交谈了片刻，爸爸身上湿淋淋的，弯下腰，一只手放在轿车的顶篷上。但当他站起身来，我从他松垮的肩膀看出，我与生俱来的那种熟悉的生活已经一去不返了。爸爸上车，车前灯亮起，在雨水中照出两道灯光。如果这是哈桑跟我过去常看的印度电影，在这个时候，我应该跑出去，赤裸的双脚溅起雨水。我应该追逐着轿车，高声叫喊，让它停下来。我应该把哈桑从后座拉出来，告诉他我很抱歉，非常抱歉，我的眼泪会跟雨水混在一起。我们会在如注大雨中拥抱。可这不是印度电影。我很抱歉，但我不会哭喊，不会追逐那辆轿车。我看着爸爸的轿车驶离路边，带走那个人，那个平生说出的第一个字是我名字的人。我最后一次模糊地瞥见哈桑，他瘫坐在后座，接着爸爸转过街角，那个我们曾无数次玩弹珠的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
