<div class="line_en">"Seats a hundred thousand," said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry's face. "Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again… bless them," he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn't stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯莱先生在前面领路，大家手里攥着买来的东西，顺着灯笼照亮的通道快步走进树林。他们可以听见成百上千的人在周围走动，听见喊叫声、欢笑声，还听见断断续续的歌声。这种狂热的兴奋情绪是很有传染性的，哈利也忍不住笑得合不拢嘴。他们在树林里走了二十分钟，一边高声地谈笑打趣，最后从树林的另一边出来了，这时他们发现自己处在一座巨大的体育馆的阴影中。哈利只能看见赛场周围的宏伟金墙的一部分，但他看得出来，里面装十个大教堂都不成问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley's party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通向体育馆的楼梯上铺着紫红色的地毯。他们和人群一起拾级而上，慢慢地那些人流分别进了左右两边的看台。韦斯莱先生率领的这一行人一直往上，最后到了楼梯顶上。他们发现自己来到了一个小包厢里，位置在体育馆的最高处，而且正对着金色的球门柱。这里有二十来张紫色和镀金坐椅，分成两排。哈利跟着韦斯莱一家排除坐进了前面一排，朝下面望去，那情景是他怎么也想象不到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十万巫师正在陆陆续续地就座，那些座位围绕着椭圆形的体育馆，呈阶梯形向上排列。这里的一切都笼罩着一种神秘的金光，这光芒仿佛来自体育馆本身。从他们居高临下的位置望去，赛场显得像天鹅绒一样平整光滑。赛场两边分别竖着三个投球的篮圈，有五十英尺高；在它们右边，几乎就在与哈利视线平行的位置，是一块巨大的黑板，上面不断闪现出金色的文字，就好像有一只看不见的巨手在黑板上龙飞凤舞地写字，然后又把它们擦去。哈利仔细一看，才知道那些闪动的文字都是给赛场观众看的广告。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利将视线从广告牌上收回，扭进头去，看看还有谁和他们一起坐在这个包厢里。包厢里现在还没什么人，只是在他们后面一排的倒数第二个座位上坐着一个小得出奇的家伙。那小家伙的两条腿太短了，只能伸在它前面的椅子上。它身上围着一条擦拭茶具的茶巾，像穿着一件宽松的袍子，它的脸埋在两只手里。可是，那一对长长的、蝙蝠般的VOA英语网却是那么眼熟…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Did sir just call me Dobby?" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf -- that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先生刚才叫我多比吗？”小精灵从手指缝间好奇地问，声音很尖，甚至比以前多比的声音还要尖，是一种微微颤抖的刺耳的声音，因此哈利怀疑——尽管家养小精灵很难区别性别——这一个大概是女的。罗恩和赫敏都从座位上回过头来，他们虽然听哈利说过多比的许多事情，但从来没有真的见过他。就连韦斯莱先生也很有兴趣地扭头望着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.</div>

Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion.

<div class="line_en">Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside. Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利突然被一道耀眼的强光刺得睁不开眼睛，顶层包厢被神奇地照亮了，使所有看台的观众都能看见包厢内的情况。哈利眯起眼睛看着入口处，只见两个气喘吁吁的巫师抬着一只很大的金杯进了包厢，把它递给了康奈利·福吉。福吉仍然一副不高兴的样子，因为他白白比划了一整天，想让保加利亚人听懂他的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers -- Bulgaria!" Bagman shouted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我们热烈鼓掌，欢迎虽败犹荣的保加利亚队员上台！”巴格曼喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七个吃了败仗的保加利亚队员上楼进入了包厢。下面的观众纷纷鼓掌欢呼，表示对他们的赞赏。哈利可以看见无数个全景望远镜的镜片朝他们这边闪烁着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum's name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克鲁姆排在最后，一副很狼狈的样子，血迹斑斑的脸上，两个黑眼圈显得格外醒目。他手里仍然攥着金色飞贼。哈利注意到，他一旦落到地面上，他的动作看上去就不那么协调了。他的两条腿有点外八字，而且肩膀明显向前弯曲。可是当巴格曼报出克鲁姆的名字时，整个体育馆给予了他无比热烈的、震耳欲聋的欢呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They'll be talking about this one for years," he said hoarsely, "a really unexpected twist, that… shame it couldn't have lasted longer… Ah yes… yes, I owe you… how much?"</div>

<div class="line_en">And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry's hands were numb with clapping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着上台的是爱尔兰队的队员们。艾丹·林齐被莫兰和康诺利扶着，第二次坠地似乎把他摔晕了，他的眼神散乱茫然。可是当特洛伊和奎格利把奖杯高高举起、观众们爆发出雷鸣般的鼓掌欢呼时，林齐也咧嘴露出了笑容。哈利的手掌都拍麻了。">查看中文翻译</div>
