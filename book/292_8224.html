<div class="line_en">It was a bright morning in the early part of summer; the river had resumed its wonted banks and its accustomed pace, and a hot sun seemed to be pulling everything green and bushy and spiky up out of the earth towards him, as if by strings. The Mole and the Water Rat had been up since dawn, very busy on matters connected with boats and the opening of the boating season; painting and varnishing, mending paddles, repairing cushions, hunting for missing boat-hooks, and so on; and were finishing breakfast in their little parlour and eagerly discussing their plans for the day, when a heavy knock sounded at the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是初夏的一个阳光灿烂的早晨。大河两岸已经重现原貌，河水恢复了通常的流速，暖烘烘的太阳，仿佛用无数根细绳，把万物从地下拔起，拽向他自己，使它们变得绿油油、郁葱葱、高 耸耸。鼹鼠和河鼠天一亮就起床，忙着为即将开始的游艇季节作准备，油漆船身啦，整理桨叶啦，修补坐垫啦，寻找丢失的带钩子的船篙啦，等等。他们正在客厅里吃早饭，热烈地讨论当天的计划，忽听得一声重重的敲门声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Mole went to attend the summons, and the Rat heard him utter a cry of surprise. Then he flung the parlour door open, and announced with much importance, 'Mr. Badger!'</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a wonderful thing, indeed, that the Badger should pay a formal call on them, or indeed on anybody. He generally had to be caught, if you wanted him badly, as he slipped quietly along a hedgerow of an early morning or a late evening, or else hunted up in his own house in the middle of the Wood, which was a serious undertaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这真是很不寻常，獾竟会亲自登门拜访他们，因为他是难得拜访任何人的。一般说，如果你急于见他，你就得在清晨或黄昏时趁他在树篱旁悄悄溜过时去遇他，或者到野林深处他家去找他，那可是件非同小可的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'WHOSE hour, you should rather say,' replied the Badger. 'Why, Toad's hour! The hour of Toad! I said I would take him in hand as soon as the winter was well over, and I'm going to take him in hand to-day!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你应该问，‘谁的时辰’，”獾答道。“当然，是蟾蜍的时辰！我说过，等冬天一过。我就要管教管教他，今天，我就是来管教他的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Toad's hour, of course!' cried the Mole delightedly. 'Hooray! I remember now! WE'LL teach him to be a sensible Toad!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然啰，是蟾蜍的时辰！”鼹鼠高兴地说。“乌拉！我想起来啦！咱们大伙是要去教训教训他，让他变得清醒点！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'This very morning,' continued the Badger, taking an arm-chair, 'as I learnt last night from a trustworthy source, another new and exceptionally powerful motor-car will arrive at Toad Hall on approval or return. At this very moment, perhaps, Toad is busy arraying himself in those singularly hideous habiliments so dear to him, which transform him from a (comparatively) good-looking Toad into an Object which throws any decent-minded animal that comes across it into a violent fit. We must be up and doing, ere it is too late. You two animals will accompany me instantly to Toad Hall, and the work of rescue shall be accomplished.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“昨晚我得到可靠的消息，”獾坐在一张扶手椅上，接着说，“说就在今天上午，又有一辆马力特大的新汽车，要开到蟾宫，由他选购，或者退货。说不定这会儿，蟾蜍已经在穿戴他心爱的那套其丑无比的服装了。本来还不难看的蟾蜍，穿上那身衣服，就成了个怪物，不管哪个头脑清醒的动物见到他，都会吓晕过去的。咱们得及早动手，要不就太迟了。你二位得陪我去一趟蟾宫，务必去拯救拯救蟾蜍。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Badger strode heavily into the room, and stood looking at the two animals with an expression full of seriousness. The Rat let his egg-spoon fall on the table-cloth, and sat open-mouthed.</div>

<div class="line_en">They set off up the road on their mission of mercy, Badger leading the way. Animals when in company walk in a proper and sensible manner, in single file, instead of sprawling all across the road and being of no use or support to each other in case of sudden trouble or danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们出发上路，去执行一项行善的任务，獾在前领路。动物们在结伴同行时，总是采取一种适当而合理的走法，就是排成竖行，而不是横跨整个路面。因为如果那样走，在突遇麻烦或危险时，就不便互相支援协助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They reached the carriage-drive of Toad Hall to find, as the Badger had anticipated, a shiny new motor-car, of great size, painted a bright red (Toad's favourite colour), standing in front of the house. As they neared the door it was flung open, and Mr. Toad, arrayed in goggles, cap, gaiters, and enormous overcoat, came swaggering down the steps, drawing on his gauntleted gloves.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Badger strode up the steps. 'Take him inside,' he said sternly to his companions. Then, as Toad was hustled through the door, struggling and protesting, he turned to the chauffeur in charge of the new motor-car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="獾大步走上台阶。“把他弄进屋去，”他严肃地吩咐两位同伴说。蟾蜍一路挣扎，抗议，被推搡到门里。獾转身对驾驶新车的司机说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'I'm afraid you won't be wanted to-day,' he said. 'Mr. Toad has changed his mind. He will not require the car. Please understand that this is final. You needn't wait.' Then he followed the others inside and shut the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今天恐怕用不着你了，蟾蜍先生已经改变主意，不要这辆车了。请你明白，这是最后决定，你不用再等了。”说罢，他跟着那几个走进屋去，关上大门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Now then!' he said to the Toad, when the four of them stood together in the Hall, 'first of all, take those ridiculous things off!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当四只动物都站在过道里时，獾对蟾蜍说：“现在，你先把这身劳什子脱掉！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就不！”蟾蜍怒冲冲地说。“这样蛮不讲理的干涉，什么意思？我要你们立刻解释清楚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had to lay Toad out on the floor, kicking and calling all sorts of names, before they could get to work properly. Then the Rat sat on him, and the Mole got his motor-clothes off him bit by bit, and they stood him up on his legs again. A good deal of his blustering spirit seemed to have evaporated with the removal of his fine panoply. Now that he was merely Toad, and no longer the Terror of the Highway, he giggled feebly and looked from one to the other appealingly, seeming quite to understand the situation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蟾蜍不住地踢踹，叫骂，他们不得不把他按倒在地，才能顺当地给他脱衣。河鼠坐在他身上，鼹鼠一件一件扒下他的驾驶服，然后他们把他提着站起来。随着蟾蜍的全副精良披挂被剥掉，他那大吼大叫的威风也消失大半了。现在，既然他不再是公路凶神，而只不过是蟾蜍，他只有无力地格格笑着，求饶似地看看这个，看看那个，像是彻底明白了他的处境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'You knew it must come to this, sooner or later, Toad,' the Badger explained severely. You've disregarded all the warnings we've given you, you've gone on squandering the money your father left you, and you're getting us animals a bad name in the district by your furious driving and your smashes and your rows with the police. Independence is all very well, but we animals never allow our friends to make fools of themselves beyond a certain limit; and that limit you've reached. Now, you're a good fellow in many respects, and I don't want to be too hard on you. I'll make one more effort to bring you to reason. You will come with me into the smoking-room, and there you will hear some facts about yourself; and we'll see whether you come out of that room the same Toad that you went in.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道，蟾蜍，早晚会有这一天的，”獾严厉地训诫说。“我们给过你那么多劝告，你全当耳边风。你一个劲儿挥霍你父亲留下的钱财。你发狂似地开车，横冲直撞，跟警察争吵，你在整个地区败坏了我们动物的名声。独立自主固然好，但我们动物绝不能听任朋友把自己变成傻瓜，越轨出格，你现在已经大大出格了。在许多方面，你都是挺不错的，我不愿对你过分严厉。我要再作一次努力，使你恢复理性。你跟我到吸烟室来，听我数落数落你的所作所为。等你从那间房里出来时，看能不能成为一个改过自新的蟾蜍。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'THAT'S no good!' said the Rat contemptuously. 'TALKING to Toad'll never cure him. He'll SAY anything.'</div>

<div class="line_en">They made themselves comfortable in armchairs and waited patiently. Through the closed door they could just hear the long continuous drone of the Badger's voice, rising and falling in waves of oratory; and presently they noticed that the sermon began to be punctuated at intervals by long-drawn sobs, evidently proceeding from the bosom of Toad, who was a soft-hearted and affectionate fellow, very easily converted-for the time being-to any point of view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩安安逸逸坐在扶手椅上，静候结果。透过紧闭的门，他们只听到獾那又长又低的训话声，一阵高，一阵低，滔滔不绝。过了一会，他们注意到獾的训话声不时被长长的抽泣声打断，那显然是发自蟾蜍的内心，因为他是个心肠软重感情的动物，很容易——暂时地——听信任何观点的规劝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“坐在这儿，蟾蜍，”獾指着一张椅子，和蔼地说。“朋友们，我很高兴地告诉你们，蟾蜍终于认识到他的做法是错误的。他对过去的越轨行为由衷地感到遗憾，决心再也不玩汽车了。他向我作出了庄严的保证。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After some three-quarters of an hour the door opened, and the Badger reappeared, solemnly leading by the paw a very limp and dejected Toad. His skin hung baggily about him, his legs wobbled, and his cheeks were furrowed by the tears so plentifully called forth by the Badger's moving discourse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约莫过了三刻钟，门开了，獾庄严地牵着一个软弱无力没精打采的蟾蜍走了出来。他的皮肤像口袋似的松垮垮地搭拉着，两腿摇摇晃晃，他被獾那感人肺腑的规劝打动了，腮帮子上满是泪痕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They arranged watches accordingly. Each animal took it in turns to sleep in Toad's room at night, and they divided the day up between them. At first Toad was undoubtedly very trying to his careful guardians. When his violent paroxysms possessed him he would arrange bedroom chairs in rude resemblance of a motor-car and would crouch on the foremost of them, bent forward and staring fixedly ahead, making uncouth and ghastly noises, till the climax was reached, when, turning a complete somersault, he would lie prostrate amidst the ruins of the chairs, apparently completely satisfied for the moment. As time passed, however, these painful seizures grew gradually less frequent, and his friends strove to divert his mind into fresh channels. But his interest in other matters did not seem to revive, and he grew apparently languid and depressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他们安排了值班。每只动物夜间轮流睡在蟾蜍的卧室里，白天也分段值班。起初，对于几个小心谨慎的朋友，蟾蜍自然是很不好对付的。他的狂热劲一上来，就把卧室里的椅子摆成大体像辆汽车的样子，自己蹲在最前面，身子前倾，两眼紧盯前方，嘴里发出古怪可怕的嘈杂声。狂热达到顶点时，他会翻一个大筋斗，倒在地上，摊开四肢躺在东倒西歪的椅子当中、暂时得到了极大的满足。不过，日子一天天过去，这种痛苦的走火入魔越来越少了。他的朋友们千方百计想引导他把心思转移到别的方面，可是他对其他事物似乎一直没有恢复兴趣。他明显变得萎靡不振郁郁寡欢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'O, WE'RE all right,' replied the Rat. 'Mole,' he added incautiously, 'is going out for a run round with Badger. They'll be out till luncheon time, so you and I will spend a pleasant morning together, and I'll do my best to amuse you. Now jump up, there's a good fellow, and don't lie moping there on a fine morning like this!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，我们都好，”河鼠答道，他很不谨慎地又加上一句：“鼹鼠跟獾一道出去遛弯了，要到吃午饭才回来。所以，今天上午就剩你跟我单独在一起，咱们要过得高高兴兴。我要尽力让你开心。快跳下床来，好小伙。天气这么好，别愁眉苦脸地赖在床上了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had to wait some minutes for an answer. At last a feeble voice replied, 'Thank you so much, dear Ratty! So good of you to inquire! But first tell me how you are yourself, and the excellent Mole?'</div>

<div class="line_en">One fine morning the Rat, whose turn it was to go on duty, went upstairs to relieve Badger, whom he found fidgeting to be off and stretch his legs in a long ramble round his wood and down his earths and burrows. 'Toad's still in bed,' he told the Rat, outside the door. 'Can't get much out of him, except, "O leave him alone, he wants nothing, perhaps he'll be better presently, it may pass off in time, don't be unduly anxious," and so on. Now, you look out, Rat! When Toad's quiet and submissive and playing at being the hero of a Sunday-school prize, then he's at his artfullest. There's sure to be something up. I know him. Well, now, I must be off.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个晴朗的早晨，轮到河鼠值班，他上楼去接替獾。他看到獾坐立不安，急着要出去散散步，遛遛腿，绕着他的树林转一圈，到地下去走一遭儿。他在门外对河鼠说：“蟾蜍还设起床。没法从他嘴里掏出多少话，只说：‘噢，别管我，我什么也不要。也许过不久我就会好的，到时候，毛病就会过去的，不必过分担忧，’等等。河鼠，你要多加小心啊！每当蟾蜍变得安静柔顺，装出一副主日学得奖乖孩子的模样时，那也就是他最最狡猾的时候。肯定会耍什么鬼花招的。我了解他。好，现在我必须走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，恐怕你们还是嫌麻烦，”蟾蜍有气无力地说。“这一点我很能理解。这很自然嘛。你们一直为我操心，已经感到厌烦了。我不该再给你们添麻烦、我知道，我是个累赘。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的、好心肠的河鼠，”蟾蜍低声咕哝，“你太不了解我的情况了，我现在怎么可能‘跳下床’呢？恐怕永远也不可能了！不过请不用为我发愁。我不愿成为朋友们的累赘，料想这也不会很久了。真的，我希望不会太久。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Well, I hope not, too,' said the Rat heartily. 'You've been a fine bother to us all this time, and I'm glad to hear it's going to stop.

<div class="line_en">'If I thought that, Ratty,' murmured Toad, more feebly than ever, 'then I would beg you-for the last time, probably-to step round to the village as quickly as possible-even now it may be too late-and fetch the doctor. But don't you bother. It's only a trouble, and perhaps we may as well let things take their course.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“既然这样，鼠儿，”蟾蜍更加虚弱地低声说，“那么我求你——也许是最后一次——尽快到村里去一趟——说不定已经太晚了——请个大夫来。算了吧，别操这份心了。这事太麻烦。也许，还是听其自然好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'I fear, dear friend,' said Toad, with a sad smile, 'that "talk" can do little in a case like this-or doctors either, for that matter; still, one must grasp at the slightest straw. And, by the way-while you are about it-I HATE to give you additional trouble, but I happen to remember that you will pass the door-would you mind at the same time asking the lawyer to step up? It would be a convenience to me, and there are moments-perhaps I should say there is A moment-when one must face disagreeable tasks, at whatever cost to exhausted nature!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的朋友，”蟾蜍惨笑着说，“光是‘谈谈’，对我这病恐怕是无济于事的——就连医生恐怕也无能为力了。不过，总得抓根稻草吧。顺便说一句，既然你打算去请医先，那就请你顺路把律师也请来，好吗？——我实在不愿再给你添麻烦，不过我忽然想起，去医生家要路过律师家门口。那样就省了我的事了，因为有的时候 ——也许我应该说，就在这一刻——你必须面对不愉快的事情。不管那要消耗你多大的体力。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Surely you have noticed of late --' murmured Toad. 'But, no-why should you? Noticing things is only a trouble. To-morrow, indeed, you may be saying to yourself, "O, if only I had noticed sooner! If only I had done something!" But no; it's a trouble. Never mind -- forget that I asked.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你近来一定注意到——”蟾蜍喃喃道。“啊不——你怎么会注意到？那太麻烦了。也许到明天，你就会说，‘唉，我要是早注意到就好了！我要是采取措施就好了！’不不，那太麻烦了。没关系，忘掉我这些话吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Look here, old man,' said the Rat, beginning to get rather alarmed, 'of course I'll fetch a doctor to you, if you really think you want him. But you can hardly be bad enough for that yet. Let's talk about something else.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'A lawyer! O, he must be really bad!' the affrighted Rat said to himself, as he hurried from the room, not forgetting, however, to lock the door carefully behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请律师！哎呀，想必他真的病得厉害了！”惊慌失措的河鼠自言自语说。他匆匆走出卧室，倒还没忘把门仔细锁好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside, he stopped to consider. The other two were far away, and he had no one to consult.</div>

<div class="line_en">'It's best to be on the safe side,' he said, on reflection. 'I've known Toad fancy himself frightfully bad before, without the slightest reason; but I've never heard him ask for a lawyer! If there's nothing really the matter, the doctor will tell him he's an old ass, and cheer him up; and that will be something gained. I'd better humour him and go; it won't take very long.' So he ran off to the village on his errand of mercy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还是小心些好，”他考虑了片刻，说道。“蟾蜍过去虽也无缘无故把自己的病想得太重，可还从没听他说要请律师呀！要是真没大病，医生会骂他是个大笨蛋，会给他打气，那倒也是一得吧。我不妨迁就一下他的怪脾气，跑一趟，用不了多久的。”于是他带着行善的使命，向村子跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Toad, who had hopped lightly out of bed as soon as he heard the key turned in the lock, watched him eagerly from the window till he disappeared down the carriage-drive. Then, laughing heartily, he dressed as quickly as possible in the smartest suit he could lay hands on at the moment, filled his pockets with cash which he took from a small drawer in the dressing-table, and next, knotting the sheets from his bed together and tying one end of the improvised rope round the central mullion of the handsome Tudor window which formed such a feature of his bedroom, he scrambled out, slid lightly to the ground, and, taking the opposite direction to the Rat, marched off lightheartedly, whistling a merry tune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一听到钥匙在锁眼里转动的声音，蟾蜍立刻轻轻跳下床，跑到窗口，急切地望着河鼠，直到车道上不见了他的踪影。接着，他开心地放声大笑，火速穿上随手抓到的最神气的衣裳，从梳妆台的一只小抽屉里取出钱，塞满了所有的衣袋。下一步，他把床单全都结在一起，又把这根临时结成的绳子一端牢系在窗框上。那美丽的都铎王朝式的窗子，是他的卧室的一景。他爬出窗口，顺着绳子轻轻滑落地上，朝着和河鼠相反的方向，吹着欢快的口哨，轻松地迈开大步，扬长而去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他装得太到家了！”垂头丧气的河鼠说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a gloomy luncheon for Rat when the Badger and the Mole at length returned, and he had to face them at table with his pitiful and unconvincing story. The Badger's caustic, not to say brutal, remarks may be imagined, and therefore passed over; but it was painful to the Rat that even the Mole, though he took his friend's side as far as possible, could not help saying, 'You've been a bit of a duffer this time, Ratty! Toad, too, of all animals!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那顿午饭，河鼠吃得没精打采。獾和鼹鼠回来后，河鼠不得不在餐桌上对他们讲述他那段难以置信的倒霉经历。獾的那种刻薄甚至粗暴的批评，可想而知，自不待言，就连竭力要站在朋友一边的鼹鼠，也不得不表示：“鼠儿，这回你可是有点糊涂！蟾蜍当然更是糊涂绝顶了！”这话深深刺痛了河鼠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'He did YOU awfully well!' rejoined the Badger hotly. 'However, talking won't mend matters. He's got clear away for the time, that's certain; and the worst of it is, he'll be so conceited with what he'll think is his cleverness that he may commit any folly. One comfort is, we're free now, and needn't waste any more of our precious time doing sentry-go. But we'd better continue to sleep at Toad Hall for a while longer. Toad may be brought back at any moment-on a stretcher, or between two policemen.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他把你蒙骗到家了！”獾怒冲冲地说。“不过，光说也于事无补。他暂时肯定已经跑得很远了。最糟的是，他自作聪明，自以为了不起，什么荒唐事都干得出来。唯一可以告慰的是，我们现在自由了，不必再浪费时间为他放哨了。不过咱们最好还是在蟾宫多住些日子。蟾蜍随时都可能回来的——不是用担架抬回来，就是被警察押送回来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Filled full of conceited thoughts such as these he strode along, his head in the air, till he reached a little town, where the sign of 'The Red Lion,' swinging across the road halfway down the main street, reminded him that he had not breakfasted that day, and that he was exceedingly hungry after his long walk. He marched into the Inn, ordered the best luncheon that could be provided at so short a notice, and sat down to eat it in the coffee-room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他满脑子自高自大的念头，昂首阔步往前走，径直来到一座小镇。在正街的中央，横悬着一幅招牌——“红狮”，这使他想起，当天还没顾上吃早饭，走了这么远的路，肚子着实饿瘪了。他大步走进小客店，要了那家招牌短短的小店所供应的一客最好的午饭，坐在咖啡室里，吃起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, Toad, gay and irresponsible, was walking briskly along the high road, some miles from home. At first he had taken by-paths, and crossed many fields, and changed his course several times, in case of pursuit; but now, feeling by this time safe from recapture, and the sun smiling brightly on him, and all Nature joining in a chorus of approval to the song of self-praise that his own heart was singing to him, he almost danced along the road in his satisfaction and conceit.</div>

The poop-poop! drew nearer and nearer, the car could be heard to turn into the inn-yard and come to a stop, and Toad had to hold on to the leg of the table to conceal his over-mastering emotion. Presently the party entered the coffee-room, hungry, talkative, and gay, voluble on their experiences of the morning and the merits of the chariot that had brought them along so well. Toad listened eagerly, all ears, for a time; at last he could stand it no longer. He slipped out of the room quietly, paid his bill at the bar, and as soon as he got outside sauntered round quietly to the inn-yard. 'There cannot be any harm,' he said to himself, 'in my only just LOOKING at it!'</div>

<div class="line_en">Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found he had hold of the handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul. As if in a dream he found himself, somehow, seated in the driver's seat; as if in a dream, he pulled the lever and swung the car round the yard and out through the archway; and, as if in a dream, all sense of right and wrong, all fear of obvious consequences, seemed temporarily suspended. He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street and leapt forth on the high road through the open country, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest, Toad the terror, the traffic-queller, the Lord of the lone trail, before whom all must give way or be smitten into nothingness and everlasting night. He chanted as he flew, and the car responded with sonorous drone; the miles were eaten up under him as he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="随后，粗暴的狱吏们扑向倒霉的蟾蜍，给他戴上镣铐，拖出法庭。他一路尖叫，祈求，抗议。他被拖着经过市场。市场上那些游手好闲的公众，对通缉犯向来都表同情和提供援助，而对已确认的罪犯则向来是疾言厉色。他们纷纷向他投来嘲骂，扔胡萝卜，喊口号。他被拖着经过起哄的学童，他们每看到一位绅士陷入困境，天真的小脸上就露出喜滋滋的神色。他被拖着走过轧轧作响的吊桥，穿过布满铁钉的铁闸门，钻过狰狞的古堡里阴森可怖的拱道，古堡上的塔楼高耸入云；穿过挤满了下班士兵的警卫室，他们冲他咧嘴狞笑；经过发出嘲弄的咳嗽的哨兵，因为当班的哨兵只许这样来表示他们对罪犯的轻蔑和嫌恶；走上一段转弯抹角的古老石级，经过身着钢盔铁甲的武士，他们从盔里射出恐吓的目光；穿过院子，院里凶恶的猛犬把皮带绷得紧紧的，爪子向空中乱抓，要向他扑过来；经过年老的狱卒，他们把兵器斜靠在墙上，对着一个肉馅饼和一罐棕色的麦酒打瞌睡；走呀走呀，走过拉肢拷问室，夹指室，走过通向秘密断头台的拐角，一直走到监狱最深处那间最阴森的地牢门前。门口坐着一个年老的狱卒，手里摆弄着一串又重又大的钥匙。就在这里，他们停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Oddsbodikins!' said the sergeant of police, taking off his helmet and wiping his forehead. 'Rouse thee, old loon, and take over from us this vile Toad, a criminal of deepest guilt and matchless artfulness and resource. Watch and ward him with all thy skill; and mark thee well, greybeard, should aught untoward befall, thy old head shall answer for his-and a murrain on both of them!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，好家伙！”警官说。他摘下钢盔，擦了擦额头的汗。“醒醒，老懒虫，把这个坏蛋蟾蜍看管起来。他是个罪行累累、狡诈奸滑、诡计多端的罪犯。灰胡子老头，你要竭尽全力把他看好，如有闪失，就要你这颗老人头——你和他都要遭殃！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gaoler nodded grimly, laying his withered hand on the shoulder of the miserable Toad. The rusty key creaked in the lock, the great door clanged behind them; and Toad was a helpless prisoner in the remotest dungeon of the best-guarded keep of the stoutest castle in all the length and breadth of Merry England.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狱卒阴沉地点点头，把他枯干的手按在不幸的蟾蜍肩上。生了锈的钥匙在锁眼里轧轧转动，笨重的牢门在他们身后恍当一声关上了。就这样，蟾蜍成了整个欢乐的英格兰国土上最坚固的城堡里最戒备森严、最隐密的地牢里一个可怜无助的囚犯。">查看中文翻译</div>
