<div class="line_en">"Take it away," said Edmund sulkily. "I don't want dry bread." But the Witch suddenly turned on him with such a terrible expression on her face that he, apologized and began to nibble at the bread, though, it was so stale he could hardly get it down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmund meanwhile had been having a most disappointing time. When the dwarf had gone to get the sledge ready he expected that the Witch would start being nice to him, as she had been at their last meeting. But she said nothing at all. And when at last Edmund plucked up his courage to say, "Please, your Majesty, could I have some Turkish Delight? You -- you -- said --" she answered, "Silence, fool!" Then she appeared to change her mind and said, as if to herself, a "And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way," and once more clapped her hands. Another, dwarf appeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">While he was still chewing away the first dwarf came back and announced that the sledge was ready. The White Witch rose and went out, ordering Edmund to go with her. The snow was again falling as they came into the courtyard, but she took no notice of that and made Edmund sit beside her on the sledge. But before they drove off she called Maugrim and he came bounding like an enormous dog to the side of the sledge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还在那儿咬啊嚼啊，第一个小矮人已回来报告雪橇准备好了。白妖婆站起来就走，同时命令爱德蒙跟她一块儿去。他们走到院子里时，雪又下起来了，但她对此并不在意，还叫爱德蒙到雪橇上坐在她身边。临出发前她又招呼芬瑞斯·乌尔夫，它就像条大狗似的跳到雪橇旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers," said the Witch, "and kill whatever you find there. If they are already gone, then make all speed to the Stone Table, but do not be seen. Wait for me there in hiding. I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river. You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table. You will know what to do if you find them!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I hear and obey, O Queen," growled the Wolf, and immediately he shot away into the snow and darkness, as quickly as a horse can gallop. In a few minutes he had called another wolf and was with him down on the dam sniffing at the Beavers' house. But of course they found it empty. It would have been a dreadful thing for the Beavers and the children if the night had remained fine, for the wolves would then have been able to follow their trail -- and ten to one would have overtaken them before they had got to the cave. But now that the snow had begun again the scent was cold and even the footprints were covered up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“遵命，女王。”那只狼吼道，说着立刻飞奔到黑暗的雪地里，就像骏马腾空那么快。转眼工夫它又叫来一只狼，一起奔向堤坝，在海狸夫妇的房子里四处嗅闻。不过房子当然是空的。要是那天晚上天气一直很好，对海狸夫妇和孩子们倒是祸害了，因为狼会跟踪他们的足迹——十之八九在他们进洞以前就会赶上他们。但这会儿又开始下雪了，气味也淡了，连脚印也都给淹没了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This lasted longer than I could describe even if I wrote pages and pages about it. But I will skip on to the time when the snow had stopped and the morning had come and they were racing along in the daylight. And still they went on and on, with no sound but the everlasting swish of the snow and the creaking of the reindeer's harness. And then at last the Witch said, "What have we here? Stop!" and they did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一路上花的时间长得很，哪怕我再写上多少页也写不完。不过我就跳过这一段，先说说这时雪停了，天亮了，他们在阳光下飞驶着。他们还在继续赶路，除了雪地上不断的嗖嗖声，驯鹿挽具的嘎吱声，什么声音也没有。最后，妖婆终于说：“我们看看这儿有什么？停下！”他们这才停下了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile the dwarf whipped up the reindeer, and the Witch and Edmund drove out under the archway and on and away into the darkness and the cold. This was a terrible journey for Edmund, who had no coat. Before they had been going quarter of an hour all the front of him was covered with snow -- he soon stopped trying to shake it off because, as quickly as he did that, a new lot gathered, and he was so tired. Soon he was wet to the skin. And oh, how miserable he was! It didn't look now as if the Witch intended to make him a King. All the things he had said to make himself believe that she was good and kind and that her side was really the right side sounded to him silly now. He would have given anything to meet the others at this moment -- even Peter! The only way to comfort himself now was to try to believe that the whole thing was a dream and that he might wake up at any moment. And as they went on, hour after hour, it did come to seem like a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时小矮人赶着驯鹿，跟妖婆和爱德蒙出了拱门，然后一路向黑暗的冰天雪地里驶去。对爱德蒙来说这可真是一次可怕的旅程，因为他没有大衣。他们走了还不到一刻钟，他面前就积满了雪—一会儿他就不再掸雪花了，因为尽管他掸得快，刚掸掉就又积起一堆来，而且他很累。不一会儿他就浑身湿透了。哦，他多惨啊。目前看来妖婆并不打算给他当国王了啊！他为了让自己相信她是好人，善心人，她这一边才是真正正义的一边，而对自己说过的种种话，如今听起来都是些蠢话了。他愿意放弃一切，这会儿就去找大家——甚至彼得！如今惟一能安慰他自己的办法就是尽量相信这整个事件是场梦，他随时会醒过来。他们走啊走啊，过了一个小时又一个小时，似乎真成为一场梦了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How Edmund hoped she was going to say something about breakfast! But she had stopped for quite a different reason. A little way off at the foot of a tree sat a merry party, a squirrel and his wife with their children and two satyrs and a dwarf and an old dogfox, all on stools round a table. Edmund couldn't quite see what they were eating, but it smelled lovely and there seemed to be decorations of holly and he wasn't at all sure that he didn't see something like a plum pudding. At the moment when the sledge stopped, the Fox, who was obviously the oldest person present, had just risen to its feet, holding a glass in its right paw as if it was going to say something. But when the whole party saw the sledge stopping and who was in it, all the gaiety went out of their faces. The father squirrel stopped eating with his fork half-way to his mouth and one of the satyrs stopped with its fork actually in its mouth, and the baby squirrels squeaked with terror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙多么希望她开口说说吃早饭的事！可是她停下来的理由却完全不同。离雪橇不远的一棵树下坐着快快乐乐的一伙：松鼠夫妇和孩子，还有两个森林神，一个小矮人．一只老雄狐，全都围着桌子坐在矮凳上。爱德蒙看不清他们在吃什么，不过味道闻起来真香，而且似乎还用了冬青做装饰，他简直不敢相信自己看见了葡萄干布丁之类的东西。雪橇停下时，那只狐狸，显然是在场年纪最老的，刚刚站起身来，右爪举起一只杯子，似乎要说些什么。但等这一伙看到雪橇停下，是谁乘在上头时，大家脸上的欢乐神情就全部消失了。松鼠爸爸的叉子举到嘴边，半途就停下不吃了。还有一个森林神嘴里含着叉子就停下了，松鼠娃娃都吓得吱吱叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”妖婆吼道，从雪橇上一跃而起，向那些受惊的动物走近几大步。“他没到这儿来过，他决不会到这儿来！你们竟敢——可是不。说你们是在说谎，那么就可以宽恕你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As for you," said the Witch, giving Edmund a stunning blow on the face as she re-mounted the sledge, "let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors. Drive on!" And Edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself. It seemed so pitiful to think of those little stone figures sitting there all the silent days and all the dark nights, year after year, till the moss grew on them and at last even their faces crumbled away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至于你，”妖婆说，重新坐上雪橇时给了他一下耳光，打得他昏头昏脑，“这就是你替奸细和叛徒求情的教训。上路！”在这个故事中爱德蒙还是第一次为别人感到难过呢。想到那些小小的石像就此坐在那儿度过寂静的白天、黑暗的夜晚，日复一日，年复一年，直到身上长满苔藓，最后甚至脸部也会分解，这似乎太可怜了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now they were steadily racing on again. And soon Edmund noticed that the snow which splashed against them as they rushed through it was much wetter than it had been all last night. At the same time he noticed that he was feeling much less cold. It was also becoming foggy. In fact every minute it grew foggier and warmer. And the sledge was not running nearly as well as it had been running up till now. At first he thought this was because the reindeer were tired, but soon he saw that that couldn't be the real reason. The sledge jerked, and skidded and kept on jolting as if it had struck against stones. And however the dwarf whipped the poor reindeer the sledge went slower and slower. There also seemed to be a curious noise all round them, but the noise of their driving and jolting and the dwarf's shouting at the reindeer prevented Edmund from hearing what it was, until suddenly the sledge stuck so fast that it wouldn't go on at all. When that happened there was a moment's silence. And in that silence Edmund could at last listen to the other noise properly. A strange, sweet, rustling, chattering noise -- and yet not so strange, for he'd heard it before -- if only he could remember where! Then all at once he did remember. It was the noise of running water. All round them though out of sight, there were streams, chattering, murmuring, bubbling, splashing and even (in the distance) roaring. And his heart gave a great leap (though he hardly knew why) when he realized that the frost was over. And much nearer there was a drip-drip-drip from the branches of all the trees. And then, as he looked at one tree he saw a great load of snow slide off it and for the first time since he had entered Narnia he saw the dark green of a fir tree. But he hadn't time to listen or watch any longer, for the Witch said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿他们又稳稳地飞驶向前。不久爱德蒙就注意到他们冲过去时溅起的雪比昨晚湿多了。同时他也注意到自己已经不大觉得冷了。天变得雾蒙蒙的。事实上，雾气越来越浓，天也越来越暖和。雪橇也远远没有原来行驶得那么快了。开头，他以为这是因为拉雪橇的驯鹿累了，但不久他就看出这不是真正的原因。雪橇猛地一动，朝边上滑去，还不断颠簸，就像撞上了石头。尽管小矮人鞭打可怜的驯鹿，雪橇还是越来越慢。他们周围似乎还有种怪异的声音，但雪橇行驶和颠簸的声音，加上小矮人吆喝驯鹿的声音，响得爱德蒙没法听清楚，直到后来雪橇突然困住了，寸步不能动弹。出了这事以后，一时四下寂静。爱德蒙总算能好好听一听那声音了。原来那是一种又奇特又可爱的沙沙声、潺潺声——但毕竟也不算太奇特，因为他知道自己以前听见过这种声音——要是他想得起在哪儿听见的就好了！接着他突然想起来了。那是流水声。虽然看不见，但就在他们周围，那是小溪潺潺欢唱，水流淙淙，噗噗冒泡，水花四溅，甚至（远处）激流咆哮。等他明白严冬已过，他心头也猛地一跳（虽然他压根不知道为什么）。离他们更近的树木的枝干上都在滴滴答答地滴水。随后，当他看着一棵树时，他看见一大块积雪从树上滑落下来，这是他进入纳尼亚以来第一次看见一棵冷杉树的深绿色。但他没时间多听多看，因为妖婆说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And of course Edmund had to obey. He stepped out into the snow -- but it was really only slush by now -- and began helping the dwarf to get the sledge out of the muddy hole it had got into. They got it out in the end, and by being very cruel to the reindeer the dwarf managed to get it on the move again, and they drove a little further. And now the snow was really melting in earnest and patches of green grass were beginning to appear in every direction. Unless you have looked at a world of snow as long as Edmund had been looking at it, you will hardly be able to imagine what a relief those green patches were after the endless white. Then the sledge stopped again.</div>

<div class="line_en">But of course this didn't prevent Edmund from seeing. Only five minutes later he noticed a dozen crocuses growing round the foot of an old tree -- gold and purple and white. Then came a sound even more delicious than the sound of the water. Close beside the path they were following a bird suddenly chirped from the branch of a tree. It was answered by the chuckle of another bird a little further off. And then, as if that had been a signal, there was chattering and chirruping in every direction, and then a moment of full song, and within five minutes the whole wood was ringing with birds' music, and wherever Edmund's eyes turned he saw birds alighting on branches, or sailing overhead or chasing one another or having their little quarrels or tidying up their feathers with their beaks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过这当然阻止不了爱德蒙观看。只过了五分钟他就注意到一棵老树脚下长着十几朵藏红花——有金色的、紫色的和白色的。接着又传来了一种比水声更美妙的声音。在他们走的那条小路附近，一只鸟突然在树枝上吱吱叫了起来。不远处另一只鸟儿喳喳叫着回答。此后，仿佛听到信号似的，四面八方都唧唧喳喳叫个不停。一时间满耳都是鸟鸣声。不到五分钟，鸟的音乐响彻了整个树林，爱德蒙不论往哪儿看，都看得见一只只鸟儿或落在树枝上，或在空中飞翔，或喧闹不休。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no trace of the fog now. The sky became bluer and bluer, and now there were white clouds hurrying across it from time to time. In the wide glades there were primroses. A light breeze sprang up which scattered drops of moisture from the swaying branches and carried cool, delicious scents against the faces of the travellers. The trees began to come fully alive. The larches and birches were covered with green, the laburnums with gold. Soon the beech trees had put forth their delicate, transparent leaves. As the travellers walked under them the light also became green. A bee buzzed across their path.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿雾已经消失得无影无踪，天空变得越来越蓝，不时还有几片白云匆匆掠过。宽阔的林间空地上开着朵朵樱草花。一阵微风吹过，摇曳的树枝上露珠纷纷洒落，拂来清凉、美妙的香味。树木都开始活过来了。落叶松和白桦树披上了绿装，金莲花金光灿灿。不久山毛榉就长出了娇嫩、透明的叶子。行人在树下走过，光线也变成绿色的了。一只蜜蜂嗡嗡叫着穿过他们走的那条小径。">查看中文翻译</div>
