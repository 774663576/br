<div class="line_en">I have thus far sketched the events of my life, but I have not shown how much I have depended on books not only for pleasure and for the wisdom they bring to all who read, but also for that knowledge which comes to others through their eyes and their ears. Indeed, books have meant so much more in my education than in that of others, that I shall go back to the time when I began to read.</div>

<div class="line_en">I read my first connected story in May, 1887, when I was seven years old, and from that day to this I have devoured everything in the shape of a printed page that has come within the reach of my hungry finger tips. As I have said, I did not study regularly during the early years of my education; nor did I read according to rule.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first I had only a few books in raised print --"readers" for beginners, a collection of stories for children, and a book about the earth called "Our World." I think that was all; but I read them over and over, until the words were so worn and pressed I could scarcely make them out. Sometimes Miss Sullivan read to me, spelling into my hand little stories and poems that she knew I should understand; but I preferred reading myself to being read to, because I liked to read again and again the things that pleased me.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was during my first visit to Boston that I really began to read in good earnest. I was permitted to spend a part of each day in the Institution library, and to wander from bookcase to bookcase, and take down whatever book my fingers lighted upon. And read I did, whether I understood one word in ten or two words on a page. The words themselves fascinated me; but I took no conscious account of what I read. My mind must, however, have been very impressionable at that period, for it retained many words and whole sentences, to the meaning of which I had not the faintest clue; and afterward, when I began to talk and write, these words and sentences would flash out quite naturally, so that my friends wondered at the richness of my vocabulary. I must have read parts of many books (in those early days I think I never read any one book through) and a great deal of poetry in this uncomprehending way, until I discovered "Little Lord Fauntleroy," which was the first book of any consequence I read understandingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在第一次去波士顿时才真正开始认真读书。那时，我可以每天在图书馆里消磨一段时间。我从一个书架逛到另一个书架，手指碰到什么书就取下来读。我确实在读书，尽管在一页里我也许只认识一两个词，但令我着迷的是词语本身。不过，我并未有意识地思考过所读内容。当时我的大脑的可塑性应该特别强，因为即使这样，我仍记住了很多词和完整的句子。虽然对所记忆内容的含义一点都不明白，但后来，我开始学习说话和写字时，这些词句自然而然地脱口而出，以至于朋友们大为惊讶，我的词汇量竟会如此丰富。我一定读过许多书的部分内容（我想，早期我从未完整读完过一本书），并以这种不求甚解的方式读了大量诗歌。直到发现《小爵爷》这本书，我才算第一次把一本有重要意义的书读懂读完。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day my teacher found me in a corner of the library poring over the pages of "The Scarlet Letter." I was then about eight years old. I remember she asked me if I liked little Pearl, and explained some of the words that had puzzled me. Then she told me that she had a beautiful story about a little boy which she was sure I should like better than "The Scarlet Letter." The name of the story was "Little Lord Fauntleroy," and she promised to read it to me the following summer. But we did not begin the story until August; the first few weeks of my stay at the seashore were so full of discoveries and excitement that I forgot the very existence of books. Then my teacher went to visit some friends in Boston, leaving me for a short time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，我的老师发现我在图书馆的一个角落里专心读着《红字》[43]。那时我大约八岁。我记得，她问我喜不喜欢小珠儿，还给我解释了一些难懂的词语。接着，她对我说，她有一本讲述一个小男孩的故事书，保证比《红字》更有趣，我一定会喜欢。那本书名叫《小爵爷》，她答应夏天就读给我听。可是，我们到八月份才开始读这本书。在海边逗留的最初几个星期里，我沉浸在猎奇和兴奋之中，忘记了书的存在。接着，我的老师去波士顿探望友人，离开了我一段时间。【注：[43]19世纪美国浪漫主义作家霍桑（1804—1864）的代表作。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she returned almost the first thing we did was to begin the story of "Little Lord Fauntleroy." I recall distinctly the time and place when we read the first chapters of the fascinating child's story. It was a warm afternoon in August. We were sitting together in a hammock which swung from two solemn pines at a short distance from the house. We had hurried through the dish-washing after luncheon, in order that we might have as long an afternoon as possible for the story. As we hastened through the long grass toward the hammock, the grasshoppers swarmed about us and fastened themselves on our clothes, and I remember that my teacher insisted upon picking them all off before we sat down, which seemed to me an unnecessary waste of time. The hammock was covered with pine needles, for it had not been used while my teacher was away. The warm sun shone on the pine trees and drew out all their fragrance. The air was balmy, with a tang of the sea in it. Before we began the story Miss Sullivan explained to me the things that she knew I should not understand, and as we read on she explained the unfamiliar words. At first there were many words I did not know, and the reading was constantly interrupted; but as soon as I thoroughly comprehended the situation, I became too eagerly absorbed in the story to notice mere words, and I am afraid I listened impatiently to the explanations that Miss Sullivan felt to be necessary. When her fingers were too tired to spell another word, I had for the first time a keen sense of my deprivations. I took the book in my hands and tried to feel the letters with an intensity of longing that I can never forget.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老师返回后，我们做的第一件事就是开始读《小爵爷》。我还清楚地记得我们开始读这个迷人的儿童故事的时间和地点。那是八月一个温暖的下午，我俩坐在离家不远处两棵深绿色松树之间的吊床上。午餐过后，我们匆匆刷了盘子，这样，就可以尽可能利用整个下午时间来读故事。我们快步穿过深深的草丛奔向吊床时，蚱蜢成群乱飞，落在我们身上。我记得老师坚持要把蚱蜢都弄走再坐下，这对我来说似乎是浪费时间，毫无必要。吊床上面落满了松针，因为老师离开后一直没有人用过。温暖的阳光照在松树上，空气中散发着松针的温润清香，还夹杂着海的腥味。读故事之前，沙利文小姐向我解释了一些她认为我不明白的东西，还在阅读过程中给我讲生词。开始时，有很多单词我都不认识，阅读常常中断。但是，当我完全理解了故事情景后，我被故事深深迷住，急于知道情节发展，顾不上注意单词，对于沙利文小姐认为有必要解释的词语，我恐怕听得也不耐烦了。当她的手指因疲惫而拼不出词的时候，我第一次产生了一种强烈的被剥夺感。我把书抓在手里，怀着一种强烈的渴望试图去摸那些字母，这一幕我永远不会忘记。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From "Little Lord Fauntleroy" I date the beginning of my true interest in books. During the next two years I read many books at my home and on my visits to Boston. I cannot remember what they all were, or in what order I read them; but I know that among them were'Greek Heroes," La Fontaine's "Fables," Hawthorne's "Wonder Book,""Bible Stories," Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare," "A Child's History of England" by Dickens, "The Arabian Nights," "The Swiss Family Robinson," "The Pilgrim's Progress," "Robinson Crusoe," "Little Women," and "Heidi," a beautiful little story which I afterward read in German. I read them in the intervals between study and play with an ever-deepening sense of pleasure. I did not study nor analyze them -- I did not know whether they were well written or not; I never thought about style or authorship. They laid their treasures at my feet, and I accepted them as we accept the sunshine and the love of our friends. I loved "Little Women" because it gave me a sense of kinship with girls and boys who could see and hear. Circumscribed as my life was in so many ways, I had to look between the covers of books for news of the world that lay outside my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对书真正产生兴趣始于《小爵爷》。在其后两年间，我在家以及游览波士顿期间读了很多书。我不全记得读了哪些书，记不得读书的先后顺序，然而我记得其中有《希腊英雄传》[44]，拉封丹的《寓言》，霍桑的《奇书》，《圣经故事》，兰姆[45]的《莎士比亚故事集》，狄更斯的《英格兰历史儿童读本》，《天方夜谭》，《瑞士人罗宾逊一家》[46]，《天路历程》[47]，《鲁滨孙飘流记》[48]，《小妇人》[49]，还有《海蒂》[50]——这是个美丽的故事，我记得后来还读了德文版。这些书都是在边学边玩之间读完的，越读越有兴趣。我既没有研究也没有分析，不知道这些书写得好不好，从未想过风格和出处。这些书把“财宝”放在我的脚下，我欣然接受，如同接受阳光和朋友的情谊一样自然。我喜欢读《小妇人》，因为它让我感到自己与耳聪目明的孩子之间关系密切。我的生活受到种种限制，因此我不得不在书中寻找外部世界的信息。【注：[44]作者为查尔斯·金斯利（1819—1875），英国作家、牧师，另有作品《水孩子》等。[45]查尔斯·兰姆（1775—1834），英国散文家。[46]作者为约翰·戴维·维斯（1743—1818）。[47]作者为约翰·班扬（1628—1688），英国著名作家、布道家。[48]作者为丹尼尔·笛福（1660—1731），是英国第一部现实主义长篇小说。[49]作者为美国作家露意莎·梅·奥尔科特（1832—1888）。[50]瑞士著名儿童文学家约翰娜·斯比丽（1827—1901）的代表作。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, again, La Fontaine seldom, if ever, appeals to our highest moral sense. The highest chords he strikes are those of reason and self-love. Through all the fables runs the thought that man's morality springs wholly from self-love, and that if that self-love is directed and restrained by reason, happiness must follow. Now, so far as I can judge, self-love is the root of all evil; but, of course, I may be wrong, for La Fontaine had greater opportunities of observing men than I am likely ever to have. I do not object so much to the cynical and satirical fables as to those in which momentous truths are taught by monkeys and foxes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，拉封丹的作品很少能够激发高尚的道德情操。拉封丹最引人关注的地方是理智与利己，所有寓言都传播着这种思想：人类的道德感完全源于利己主义，假如由理性来驾驭和控制利己主义的话，那么幸福一定会到来。而据我判断，利己主义是一切罪恶之源。当然，我也许是错的，因为拉封丹比我有更多的观察人生的机会。我并不反对冷嘲热讽的寓言，只是不赞成通过猴子和狐狸之口来传授至理名言。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not care especially for "The Pilgrim's Progress," which I think I did not finish, or for the "Fables." I read La Fontaine's "Fables" first in an English translation, and enjoyed them only after a half-hearted fashion. Later I read the book again in French, and I found that, in spite of the vivid word-pictures, and the wonderful mastery of language, I liked it no better. I do not know why it is, but stories in which animals are made to talk and act like human beings have never appealed to me very strongly. The ludicrous caricatures of the animals occupy my mind to the exclusion of the moral.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不怎么喜欢《天路历程》，我想这本书我并没有读完。《寓言》我也不怎么喜欢。我最初读拉封丹的《寓言》读的是英文版，心不在焉地往下读。后来，我又读了法文版《寓言》，我发现，无论书中文字多么生动，故事多么精彩，我还是不太喜欢。我说不出为什么会是这样，不过，书中像人一样说话、行动的动物却从来没有引起过我太大的兴趣。动物滑稽可笑的模仿给我留下深刻印象，使我注意不到其中的寓意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I love "The Jungle Book" and "Wild Animals I Have Known."I feel a genuine interest in the animals themselves, because they are real animals and not caricatures of men. One sympathizes with their loves and hatreds, laughs over their comedies, and weeps over their tragedies. And if they point a moral, it is so subtle that we are not conscious of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mind opened naturally and joyously to a conception of antiquity. Greece, ancient Greece, exercised a mysterious fascination over me. In my fancy the pagan gods and goddesses still walked on earth and talked face to face with men, and in my heart I secretly built shrines to those I loved best. I knew and loved the whole tribe of nymphs and heroes and demigods -- no, not quite all, for the cruelty and greed of Medea and Jason were too monstrous to be forgiven, and I used to wonder why the gods permitted them to do wrong and then punished them for their wickedness. And the mystery is still unsolved. I often wonder how God can dumbness keep while Sin creeps grinning through His house of Time.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the Iliad that made Greece my paradise. I was familiar with the story of Troy before I read it in the original, and consequently I had little difficulty in making the Greek words surrender their treasures after I had passed the borderland of grammar. Great poetry, whether written in Greek or in English, needs no other interpreter than a responsive heart. Would that the host of those who make the great works of the poets odious by their analysis, impositions and laborious comments might learn this simple truth! It is not necessary that one should be able to define every word and give it its principal parts and its grammatical position in the sentence in order to understand and appreciate a fine poem. I know my learned professors have found greater riches in the Iliad than I shall ever find; but I am not avaricious. I am content that others should be wiser than I. But with all their wide and comprehensive knowledge, they cannot measure their enjoyment of that splendid epic, nor can I. When I read the finest passages of the Iliad, I am conscious of a soul-sense that lifts me above the narrow, cramping circumstances of my life. My physical limitations are forgotten -- my world lies upward, the length and the breadth and the sweep of the heavens are mine!</div>

One could have traveled round the word many times while I trudged my weary way through the labyrinthine mazes of grammars and dictionaries, or fell into those dreadful pitfalls called examinations, set by schools and colleges for the confusion of those who seek after knowledge.

<div class="line_en">I began to read the Bible long before I could understand it. Now it seems strange to me that there should have been a time when my spirit was deaf to its wondrous harmonies; but I remember well a rainy Sunday morning when, having nothing else to do, I begged my cousin to read me a story out of the Bible. Although she did not think I should understand, she began to spell into my hand the story of Joseph and his brothers. Somehow it failed to interest me. The unusual language and repetition made the story seem unreal and far away in the land of Canaan, and I fell asleep and wandered off to the land of Nod, before the brothers came with the coat of many colours unto the tent of Jacob and told their wicked lie! I cannot understand why the stories of the Greeks should have been so full of charm for me, and those of the Bible so devoid of interest, unless it was that I had made the acquaintance of several Greeks in Boston and been inspired by their enthusiasm for the stories of their country; whereas I had not met a single Hebrew or Egyptian, and therefore concluded that they were nothing more than barbarians, and the stories about them were probably all made up, which hypothesis explained the repetitions and the queer names. Curiously enough, it never occurred to me to call Greek patronymics "queer."</div>

I do not think that the knowledge which I have gained of its history and sources compensates me for the unpleasant details it has forced upon my attention. For my part, I wish, with Mr. Howells, that the literature of the past might be purged of all that is ugly and barbarous in it, although I should object as much as any one to having these great works weakened or falsified.</div>

<div class="line_en">I do not remember a time since I have been capable of loving books that I have not loved Shakespeare. I cannot tell exactly when I began Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare"; but I know that I read them at first with a child's understanding and a child's wonder. "Macbeth" seems to have impressed me most. One reading was sufficient to stamp every detail of the story upon my memory forever. For a long time the ghosts and witches pursued me even into Dreamland. I could see, absolutely see, the dagger and Lady Macbeth's little white hand -- the dreadful stain was as real to me as to the grief-stricken queen.</div>

Love like Ruth's, love which can rise above conflicting creeds and deep-seated racial prejudices, is hard to find in all the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">I must have made the acquaintance of Shylock and Satan about the same time, for the two characters were long associated in my mind. I remember that I was sorry for them. I felt vaguely that they could not be good even if they wished to, because no one seemed willing to help them or to give them a fair chance. Even now I cannot find it in my heart to condemn them utterly. There are moments when I feel that the Shylocks, the Judases, and even the Devil, are broken spokes in the great wheel of good which shall in due time be made whole.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next to poetry I love history. I have read every historical work that I have been able to lay my hands on, from a catalogue of dry facts and dryer dates to Green's impartial, picturesque "History of the English People"; from Freeman's "History of Europe" to Emerton's "Middle Ages." The first book that gave me any real sense of the value of history was Swinton's "World History," which I received on my thirteenth birthday. Though I believe it is no longer considered valid, yet I have kept it ever since as one of my treasures. From it I learned how the races of men spread from land to land and built great cities, how a few great rulers, earthly Titans, put everything under their feet, and with a decisive word opened the gates of happiness for millions and closed them upon millions more: how different nations pioneered in art and knowledge and broke ground for the mightier growths of coming ages; how civilization underwent as it were, the holocaust of a degenerate age, and rose again, like the Phoenix, among the nobler sons of the North; and how by liberty, tolerance and education the great and the wise have opened the way for the salvation of the whole world.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have since read Shakespeare's plays many times and know parts of them by heart, but I cannot tell which of them I like best. My delight in them is as varied as my moods. The little songs and the sonnets have a meaning for me as fresh and wonderful as the dramas. But, with all my love for Shakespeare, it is often weary work to read all the meanings into his lines which critics and commentators have given them. I used to try to remember their interpretations, but they discouraged and vexed me; so I made a secret compact with myself not to try any more. This compact I have only just broken in my study of Shakespeare under Professor Kittredge. I know there are many things in Shakespeare, and in the world, that I do not understand; and I am glad to see veil after veil lift gradually, revealing new realms of thought and beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，我多次阅读莎士比亚戏剧，对其中部分场景了然于心，但却说不出最喜欢哪一部。我对它们的喜爱如同我的情绪一样，变化不定。短诗和十四行诗对我来说与戏剧一样，清新脱俗，奇妙无比。然而，虽然我酷爱莎士比亚，但是，学习评论家和注释者对每一行诗所作的阐释确实令人厌烦。我曾试图记住别人的诠释，但那些评论往往令我失望，让我气恼不已。所以，我悄悄同自己签了份“协议”——不再看那些评论。直到跟着基特里奇教授学习莎士比亚，这份“协议”才被撕毁。我知道，在莎士比亚作品里，以及现实世界中，有许多东西我还不理解。我很高兴地看到面纱被一层层逐渐掀起，显现出思想和美的新境界。">查看中文翻译</div>

The German puts strength before beauty, and truth before convention, both in life and in literature. There is a vehement, sledge-hammer vigour about everything that he does. When he speaks, it is not to impress others, but because his heart would burst if he did not find an outlet for the thoughts that burn in his soul.</div>

<div class="line_en">I am afraid I have written too much about my book-friends, and yet I have mentioned only the authors I love most; and from this fact one might easily suppose that my circle of friends was very limited and undemocratic, which would be a very wrong impression. I like many writers for many reasons -- Carlyle for his ruggedness and scorn of shams; Wordsworth, who teaches the oneness of man and nature; I find an exquisite pleasure in the oddities and surprises of Hood, in Herrick's quaintness and the palpable scent of lily and rose in his verses; I like Whittier for his enthusiasms and moral rectitude. I knew him, and the gentle remembrance of our friendship doubles the pleasure I have in reading his poems. I love Mark Twain -- who does not? The gods, too, loved him and put into his heart all manner of wisdom; then, fearing lest he should become a pessimist, they spanned his mind with a rainbow of love and faith. I like Scott for his freshness, dash and large honesty. I love all writers whose minds, like Lowell's, bubble up in the sunshine of optimism -- fountains of joy and good will, with occasionally a splash of anger and here and there a healing spray of sympathy and pity.</div>
