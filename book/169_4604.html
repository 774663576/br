<div class="line_en">Each night before sleep, she murmured her prayer into her pillow. "Ser Gregor," it went. "Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei." She would have whispered the names of the Freys of the Crossing too, if she had known them. One day I'll know, she told herself, and then I'll kill them all.</div>

<div class="line_en">He never told her his name. Neither did the waif, the little girl with the big eyes and hollow face who reminded her of another little girl, named Weasel. Like Arya, the waif lived below the temple, along with three acolytes, two serving men, and a cook called Umma. Umma liked to talk as she worked, but Arya could not understand a word she said. The others had no names, or did not choose to share them. One serving man was very old, his back bent like a bow. The second was red-faced, with hair growing from his ears. She took them both for mutes until she heard them praying. The acolytes were younger. The eldest was her father's age; the other two could not have been much older than Sansa, who had been her sister. The acolytes wore black and white too, but their robes had no cowls, and were black on the left side and white on the right. With the kindly man and the waif, it was the opposite. Arya was given servant's garb: a tunic of undyed wool, baggy breeches, linen smallclothes, cloth slippers for her feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从没把自己的名字告诉她，那流浪儿也没有。流浪儿眼睛大，脸颊凹陷，让她想起另一个叫黄鼠狼的小女孩。跟艾莉亚一样，她也住在神庙里，庙中还有三个侍僧、两个仆人和厨师乌玛。乌玛喜欢边干活边讲话，但她说的艾莉亚一个字也听不懂。其他人没有名字，或不愿公开姓名。有一位仆人年纪太大，背驼得像把弓；另一位红脸孔，耳朵里长出毛发。她原以为他俩是哑巴，直到听见他们祈祷。侍僧们比较年轻，最大的跟她父亲年龄相仿，其他两位比她姐姐珊莎大不了多少，他们也穿黑白长袍，却没有兜帽，而且左黑右白——跟慈祥的人和流浪儿正好相反。他们拿仆人的衣服给艾莉亚穿：未经染色的羊毛上衣，松垮的长裤，麻布内衣，布拖鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No one," she would answer, she who had been Arya of House Stark, Arya Underfoot, Arya Horseface. She had been Arry and Weasel too, and Squab and Salty, Nan the cupbearer, a grey mouse, a sheep, the ghost of Harrenhal… but not for true, not in her heart of hearts. In there she was Arya of Winterfell, the daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn, who had once had brothers named Robb and Bran and Rickon, a sister named Sansa, a direwolf called Nymeria, a half brother named Jon Snow. In there she was someone… but that was not the answer that he wanted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without a common language, Arya had no way of talking to the others. She listened to them, though, and repeated the words she heard to herself as she went about her work. Though the youngest acolyte was blind, he had charge of the candles. He would walk the temple in soft slippers, surrounded by the murmurings of the old women who came each day to pray. Even without eyes, he always knew which candles had gone out. "He has the scent to guide him," the kindly man explained, "and the air is warmer where a candle burns." He told Arya to close her eyes and try it for herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">They prayed at dawn before they broke their fast, kneeling around the still, black pool. Some days the kindly man led the prayer. Other days it was the waif. Arya only knew a few words of Braavosi, the ones that were the same in High Valyrian. So she prayed her own prayer to the Many-Faced God, the one that went, "Ser Gregor, Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei." She prayed in silence. If the Many-Faced God was a proper god, he would hear her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黎明时分，早饭之前，他们跪在平静的黑水池边祈祷。有些天由慈祥的人领头，其余时候则由流浪儿领头。艾莉亚只懂得一点点布拉佛斯语，那些跟高等瓦雷利亚语相同的词汇，因此她向千面之神祈祷时念自己的祷词，也即“格雷果爵士，邓森，‘甜嘴’拉夫，伊林爵士，马林爵士，瑟曦太后。”她默默祈祷，心想假如千面之神才是真正灵验的神，他应该会听取她的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Worshipers came to the House of Black and White every day. Most came alone and sat alone; they lit candles at one altar or another, prayed beside the pool, and sometimes wept. A few drank from the black cup and went to sleep; more did not drink. There were no services, no songs, no paeans of praise to please the god. The temple was never full. From time to time, a worshiper would ask to see a priest, and the kindly man or the waif would take him down into the sanctum, but that did not happen often.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天都有敬拜者来黑白之院，其中大多数人独行独坐，点燃祭坛上的蜡烛，在水池边祈祷，有时还会哭泣。有人用黑杯子舀水喝，然后去睡觉，更多人则不喝水。这里没有仪式，没有颂歌，没有神的赞美诗，也从不拥挤。偶而，敬拜者会求见牧师，慈祥的人或流浪儿便带他去下面的圣室，但那并不多见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thirty different gods stood along the walls, surrounded by their little lights. The Weeping Woman was the favorite of old women, Arya saw; rich men preferred the Lion of Night, poor men the Hooded Wayfarer. Soldiers lit candles to Bakkalon, the Pale Child, sailors to the Moon-Pale Maiden and the Merling King. The Stranger had his shrine as well, though hardly anyone ever came to him. Most of the time only a single candle stood flickering at his feet. The kindly man said it did not matter. "He has many faces, and many ears to hear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三十尊不同的神像沿墙站立，被点点烛光环绕。艾莉亚发现“泣妇”是老妇人的最爱，而富翁偏爱“夜狮”，穷人崇拜“兜帽行者”，士兵会在“巴卡隆”，也即“苍白圣童”的祭坛前点燃蜡烛，水手的对象是“淡月处女”和“人鱼王”。她还惊奇地看见了陌客的祭坛，虽然几乎没人去那里。大多时候，只有一支蜡烛在陌客脚边闪烁。慈祥的人说这没关系，“他有许多张脸孔，有许多聆听的耳朵。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The knoll on which the temple stood was honeycombed with passageways hewn from the rock. The priests and acolytes had their sleeping cells on the first level, Arya and the servants on the second. The lowest level was forbidden to all save the priests. That was where the holy sanctum lay.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she was not working, Arya was free to wander as she would amongst the vaults and storerooms, so long as she did not leave the temple, nor descend to the third cellar. She found a room full of weapons and armor: ornate helms and curious old breastplates, longswords, daggers, and dirks, crossbows and tall spears with leaf-shaped heads. Another vault was crammed with clothing, thick furs and splendid silks in half a hundred colors, next to piles of foul-smelling rags and threadbare roughspuns. There must be treasure chambers too, Arya decided. She pictured stacks of golden plates, bags of silver coins, sapphires blue as the sea, ropes of fat green pearls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当她不干活时，便可以随意在地窖和库房间走动，只要不离开神庙或下去第三层。她找到一间满是武器防具的屋子：釉彩头盔、奇特而古老的胸甲、长剑、匕首、小刀，还有十字弓和镶嵌叶形尖头的长矛。另一间地窖塞满了衣服，包括厚厚的裘皮，五颜六色的艳丽丝绸，边上却堆着臭烘烘的破烂袍子和脱线的粗布衫。一定有藏宝室，艾莉亚断定。她想象着一叠叠金盘子，一袋袋银币，海一般的蓝宝石，绿色大珍珠串成绳子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She got along well enough with the cook. Umma would slap a knife into her hand and point at an onion, and Arya would chop it. Umma would shove her toward a mound of dough, and Arya would knead it until the cook said stop (stop was the first Braavosi word she learned). Umma would hand her a fish, and Arya would bone it and fillet it and roll it in the nuts the cook was crushing. The brackish waters that surrounded Braavos teemed with fish and shellfish of every sort, the kindly man explained. A slow brown river entered the lagoon from the south, wandering through a wide expanse of reeds, tidal pools, and mudflats. Clams and cockles abounded hereabouts; mussels and muskfish, frogs and turtles, mud crabs and leopard crabs and climber crabs, red eels, black eels, striped eels, lampreys, and oysters; all made frequent appearances on the carved wooden table where the servants of the Many-Faced God took their meals. Some nights Umma spiced the fish with sea salt and cracked peppercorns, or cooked the eels with chopped garlic. Once in a great while the cook would even use some saffron. Hot Pie would have liked it here, Arya thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总的来说，她跟厨师关系不错。乌玛将小刀塞入她手中，然后指指洋葱，艾莉亚就会去切；乌玛把她推到生面团跟前，艾莉亚就开始揉，直到厨师叫停（“停”是她在神庙里学会的第一个布拉佛斯词汇）；乌玛交给她鱼，艾莉亚就剔骨切片，并将厨师碾碎的干果卷在里面。布拉佛斯周围的鱼类和贝壳海腥味太重，慈祥的人不喜欢，但有一条棕色和缓的河流从南面注入大礁湖，途中蜿蜒穿越一大片芦苇、潮水坑、泥沼和浅滩，那里所产的大量蛤蜊扇贝，包括蚌壳、麝香鱼、青蛙、乌龟、泥蟹、花蟹、攀缘蟹、红鳗、黑鳗、条纹鳗，七鳃鳗和牡蛎等等，全是千面之神的仆人们就餐的雕花木桌上经常出现的食物。有些晚上，乌玛用海盐和碎胡椒子烧鱼，或用蒜末煮鳗，偶尔甚至会加一点藏红花。热派会喜欢上这里的，艾莉亚心想。">查看中文翻译</div>

They only raise their hands to kill, she thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">Supper was her favorite time. It had been a long while since Arya had gone to sleep every night with a full belly. Some nights the kindly man would allow her to ask him questions. Once she asked him why the people who came to the temple always seemed so peaceful; back home, people were scared to die. She remembered how that pimply squire had wept when she stabbed him in the belly, and the way Ser Amory Lorch had begged when the Goat had him thrown in the bear pit. She remembered the village by the God's Eye, and the way the villagers shrieked and screamed and whimpered whenever the Tickler started asking after gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她喜欢晚餐时间，因为之前无穷岁月里似乎都是饿着肚子入睡的。有些晚上，慈祥的人允许她问问题。某回，她问他，为什么来神庙里的人总显得如此平静，而她家乡的人却贪生怕死。她记得将匕首插入疙瘩脸的侍从肚子时，他如何哭泣；她记得“山羊”把亚摩利·洛奇爵士扔进熊坑时，他如何乞求；她记得神眼湖边，每当“记事本”开始询问金子的去向，村民们如何嗷嗷怪叫，屎尿齐流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Death is not the worst thing," the kindly man replied. "It is His gift to us, an end to want and pain.

When our sins and our sufferings grow too great to be borne, the angel takes us by the hand to lead us to the nightlands, where the stars burn ever bright.

When you smell our candles burning, what does it make you think of, my child?"</div>

She swept the temple floors; she served and poured at meals; she sorted piles of dead men's clothing, emptied their purses, and counted out stacks of queer coins. Every morning she walked beside the kindly man as he made his circuit of the temple to find the dead. Silent as a shadow, she would tell herself, remembering Syrio. She carried a lantern with thick iron shutters. At each alcove, she would open the shutter a crack, to look for corpses. The dead were never hard to find. They came to the House of Black and White, prayed for an hour or a day or a year, drank sweet dark water from the pool, and stretched out on a stone bed behind one god or another. They closed their eyes, and slept, and never woke. "The gift of the Many-Faced God takes myriad forms," the kindly man told her, "but here it is always gentle." When they found a body he would say a prayer and make certain life had fled, and Arya would fetch the serving men, whose task it was to carry the dead down to the vaults. There acolytes would strip and wash the bodies. The dead men's clothes and coins and valuables went into a bin for sorting. Their cold flesh would be taken to the lower sanctum where only the priests could go; what happened in there Arya was not allowed to know. Once, as she was eating her supper, a terrible suspicion seized hold of her, and she put down her knife and stared suspiciously at a slice of pale white meat. The kindly man saw the horror on her face. "It is pork, child," he told her, "only pork."</div>

The mattress was stuffed with rags instead of straw, which made it lumpier than the one she'd had at Harrenhal, but less scratchy too. She was allowed as many blankets as she wished; thick woolen blankets, red and green and plaid. And her cell was hers alone.

We have flowered in Braavos amongst these northern fogs, but we first took root in Valyria, amongst the wretched slaves who toiled in the deep mines beneath the Fourteen Flames that lit the Freehold's nights of old. Most mines are dank and chilly places, cut from cold dead stone, but the Fourteen Flames were living mountains with veins of molten rock and hearts of fire. So the mines of old Valyria were always hot, and they grew hotter as the shafts were driven deeper, ever deeper. The slaves toiled in an oven. The rocks around them were too hot to touch. The air stank of brimstone and would sear their lungs as they breathed it. The soles of their feet would burn and blister, even through the thickest sandals.

Some will even tell you he was an overseer who took pity on his charges. The truth is, no one knows. Whoever he was, he moved amongst the slaves and would hear them at their prayers. Men of a hundred different nations labored in the mines, and each prayed to his own god in his own tongue, yet all were praying for the same thing. It was release they asked for, an end to pain. A small thing, and simple. Yet their gods made no answer, and their suffering went on. Are their gods all deaf? he wondered… until a realization came upon him, one night in the red darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无名之辈，”他回答。“有人认为他本身就是个奴隶，有人坚持说他是自由堡垒的公民，出身于贵族世家，有人甚至会告诉你，他是个同情手下奴隶的监工。事实上，没人真正清楚他的来历，大家只知道，他在奴隶中活动，聆听他们的祈祷。上百个国家的子民被抓来在矿井中劳作，每个人都用自己的语言向自己的神祷告，然而祈求的都是同一件事——解脱，终结痛苦，一件极为普通极其简单的小事，却得不到神的回应。煎熬无止境地继续着。难道世上的神们全聋了吗？他疑惑地想…直到有天晚上，在泛红的黑暗中，他明白了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon thereafter the kindly man commanded her to help the other acolytes prepare the corpses. The work was not near as hard as scrubbing steps for Weese. Sometimes if the corpse was big or fat she would struggle with the weight, but most of the dead were old dry bones in wrinkled skins. Arya would look at them as she washed them, wondering what brought them to the black pool. She remembered a tale she had heard from Old Nan, about how sometimes during a long winter men who'd lived beyond their years would announce that they were going hunting. And their daughters would weep and their sons would turn their faces to the fire, she could hear Old Nan saying, but no one would stop them, or ask what game they meant to hunt, with the snows so deep and the cold wind howling. She wondered what the old Braavosi told their sons and daughters, before they set off for the House of Black and White.</div>

The canals were crooked, the alleys crookeder. Men gave her curious looks as she went past, and beggar children called out words she could not understand. Before long she was completely lost.</div>
