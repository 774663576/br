<div class="line_en">That was such a sweet dream, Sansa thought drowsily. She had been back in Winterfell, running through the godswood with her Lady. Her father had been there, and her brothers, all of them warm and safe. If only dreaming could make it so…</div>

<div class="line_en">She threw back the coverlets. I must be brave. Her torments would soon be ended, one way or the other. If Lady was here, I would not be afraid. Lady was dead, though; Robb, Bran, Rickon, Arya, her father, her mother, even Septa Mordane. All of them are dead but me. She was alone in the world now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her lord husband was not beside her, but she was used to that. Tyrion was a bad sleeper and often rose before the dawn. Usually she found him in the solar, hunched beside a candle, lost in some old scroll or leatherbound book. Sometimes the smell of the morning bread from the ovens took him to the kitchens, and sometimes he would climb up to the roof garden or wander all alone down Traitor's Walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夫君不在身边，但她早已习惯。提利昂睡得很浅，通常天亮前就起床，坐到书房里，蜷在烛光下，忘我地阅读老旧的卷轴或皮革书籍。有时候，烤早餐面包的香味会将他引去厨房，还有的时候，他跑上屋顶花园，或在叛徒走道上散步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She threw back the shutters and shivered as gooseprickles rose along her arms. There were clouds massing in the eastern sky, pierced by shafts of sunlight. They look like two huge castles afloat in the morning sky. Sansa could see their walls of tumbled stone, their mighty keeps and barbicans. Wispy banners swirled from atop their towers and reached for the fast-fading stars. The sun was coming up behind them, and she watched them go from black to grey to a thousand shades of rose and gold and crimson. Soon the wind mushed them together, and there was only one castle where there had been two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎推开窄窗，突来的寒意不禁让她手上起了鸡皮疙瘩。东边天际乌云密布，只有几许阳光射入。晨雾朦胧，好似有座大城堡在空中浮动。流云作墙壁、堡垒和碉楼，缕缕轻丝是城上的旗帜，与泯灭的群星相连。太阳越升越高，城堡由黑转灰，最后化为千万道玫瑰色、金色或绯红色的彩带，延绵不绝，最后被清风吹散。雾中的城堡渐不复见，只剩地面真实的红堡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa let Shae pull her shift up over her head and climbed into the big wooden tub. She was tempted to ask for a cup of wine, to calm her nerves. The wedding was to be at midday in the Great Sept of Baelor across the city. And come evenfall the feast would be held in the throne room; a thousand guests and seventy-seven courses, with singers and jugglers and mummers. But first came breakfast in the Queen's Ballroom, for the Lannisters and the Tyrell men -- the Tyrell women would be breaking their fast with Margaery -- and a hundred odd knights and lordlings. They have made me a Lannister, Sansa thought bitterly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪伊替她脱掉衣服，扶她进入大木盆。她紧张极了，很想要杯酒。盛大的婚礼将于正午时分在红堡对面的贝勒大圣堂举行，黄昏时移驾王座厅召开宴会：一千名客人，七十七道大餐，以及歌手、戏子和杂耍艺人们的表演。但首先，清晨在太后的舞厅进行早餐会，与会者包括兰尼斯特全族（除了行动不得的蓝赛尔）和提利尔家的男性——他们家的女性负责陪伴玛格丽小姐——以及双方麾下上百位领主和骑士。他们把我算作兰尼斯特家的人，珊莎苦涩地想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the Imp returned a short time later, he was presentable enough, and even a little taller. Podrick Payne had changed as well, and looked almost a proper squire for once, although a rather large red pimple in the fold beside his nose spoiled the effect of his splendid purple, white, and gold raiment. He is such a timid boy. Sansa had been wary of Tyrion's squire at first; he was a Payne, cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne who had taken her father's head off. However, she'd soon come to realize that Pod was as frightened of her as she was of his cousin. Whenever she spoke to him, he turned the most alarming shade of red.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="良久，小恶魔折回来。他总算有些模样了，装扮之后，甚至显得高了一点。波德瑞克·派恩也换上一身华丽的紫白金三色服装，若非鼻子旁边那个红色大疹子，看起来倒是个像模像样的侍从。这孩子很害羞，起初珊莎心存防备，因为对方是派恩家族的人，而正是伊林·派恩爵士砍了父亲的头；但不久之后她便明白，这孩子就像她怕伊林爵士一样怕她。无论什么时候问话，他一律羞红了脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the Queen's Ballroom they broke their fast on honeycakes baked with blackberries and nuts, gammon steaks, bacon, fingerfish crisped in breadcrumbs, autumn pears, and a Dornish dish of onions, cheese, and chopped eggs cooked up with fiery peppers. "Nothing like a hearty breakfast to whet one's appetite for the seventy-seven-course feast to follow," Tyrion commented as their plates were filled. There were flagons of milk and flagons of mead and flagons of a light sweet golden wine to wash it down. Musicians strolled among the tables, piping and fluting and fiddling, while Ser Dontos galloped about on his broomstick horse and Moon Boy made farting sounds with his cheeks and sang rude songs about the guests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在太后的舞厅里，他们享用黑莓与坚果烤的蜂蜜蛋糕，腌猪腿，培根，面包屑炸海星肉，秋梨，以及一道按多恩风味加大量胡椒粉烹制的洋葱奶酪配鸡蛋。“享受七十七道大餐之前，来顿开胃早饭真美妙。”提利昂评论。席间还提供大壶的牛奶、蜜酒和低度金色甜葡萄酒。乐师在厅内游荡，吹笛子，拉竖琴。唐托斯爵士骑着扫帚马跑来跑去，月童则用肥胖的脸颊模仿放屁的声音，并为客人们唱低俗歌谣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion scarce touched his food, Sansa noticed, though he drank several cups of the wine. For herself, she tried a little of the Dornish eggs, but the peppers burned her mouth. Otherwise she only nibbled at the fruit and fish and honeycakes. Every time Joffrey looked at her, her tummy got so fluttery that she felt as though she'd swallowed a bat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎发现丈夫基本不吃，只把酒喝了一杯又一杯。她自己要了多恩鸡蛋，可惜胡椒粉的味道太重，此外咬了一点水果、鱼和蛋糕。每当乔佛里的眼睛转过来，她的肚子就开始翻滚，好像有只蝙蝠在里面飞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then it was time for gifts. it was traditional in the Reach to give presents to bride and groom on the morning of their wedding; on the morrow they would receive more presents as a couple, but today's tokens were for their separate persons.</div>

<div class="line_en">From Jalabbar Xho, Joffrey received a great bow of golden wood and quiver of long arrows fletched with green and scarlet feathers; from Lady Tanda a pair of supple riding boots; from Ser Kevan a magnificent red leather jousting saddle; a red gold brooch wrought in the shape of a scorpion from the Dornishman, Prince Oberyn; silver spurs from Ser Addam Marbrand; a red silk tourney pavilion from Lord Mathis Rowan. Lord Paxter Redwyne brought forth a beautiful wooden model of the war galley of two hundred oars being built even now on the Arbor. "If it please Your Grace, she will be called King Joffrey's Valor," he said, and Joff allowed that he was very pleased indeed. "I will make it my flagship when I sail to Dragonstone to kill my traitor uncle Stannis," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾拉巴·梭尔献上一把镀金巨弓，搭配的长箭支装有绿色和绯红色的羽毛；坦妲伯爵夫人献上一对柔软马靴；凯冯爵士献上一个极为华丽的红皮革马鞍；多恩领亲王奥柏伦献上一个蝎子形状的红金胸针。此外，亚当·马尔布兰爵士的礼物是银马刺，马图斯·罗宛伯爵的礼物是长枪比武时用的红丝帐篷，派克斯特·雷德温伯爵则捎来一个漂亮的木舰模型，足足两百条桨，他声称这艘船目前正在青亭岛加紧赶造，“若蒙陛下恩准，我将把她命名为‘乔佛里国王的勇气号’。”小乔开心地应允，“我要用它作旗舰，直捣龙石岛，杀死叛徒叔叔史坦尼斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the food had been cleared away, the queen solemnly presented Joff with the wife's cloak that he would drape over Margaery's shoulders. "It is the cloak I donned when Robert took me for his queen, the same cloak my mother Lady Joanna wore when wed to my lord father." Sansa thought it looked threadbare, if truth be told, but perhaps because it was so used.</div>

He slashed again. "And when I face my uncle Stannis it will break his magic sword clean in two." Joff tried a downcut, forcing Ser Balon Swann to take a hasty step backward. Laughter rang through the hall at the look on Ser Balon's face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I remember." Joffrey brought Widow's Wail down in a savage twohanded slice, onto the book that Tyrion had given him. The heavy leather cover parted at a stroke. "Sharp! I told you, I am no stranger to Valyrian steel." It took him half a dozen further cuts to hack the thick tome apart, and the boy was breathless by the time he was done. Sansa could feel her husband struggling with his fury as Ser Osmund Kettleblack shouted, "I pray you never turn that wicked edge on me, sire."</div>

<div class="line_en">As they were crossing the yard, Prince Oberyn of Dorne fell in beside them, his black-haired paramour on his arm. Sansa glanced at the woman curiously. She was baseborn and unwed, and had home two bastard daughters for the prince, but she did not fear to look even the queen in the eye. Shae had told her that this Ellaria worshiped some Lysene love goddess. "She was almost a whore when he found her, m'lady," her maid confided, "and now she's near a princess." Sansa had never been this close to the Dornishwoman before. She is not truly beautiful, she thought, but something about her draws the eye.</div>

Viserys might only have reigned a year, but he ruled for fifteen, while Daeron warred and Baelor prayed." He made a sour face. "And if he did remove his nephew, can you blame him? Someone had to save the realm from Baelor's follies."</div>
