<div class="line_en">He was reading very quickly, as if he were eager to get to the end. Indeed they were very close to the Lighthouse now. There it loomed up, stark and straight, glaring white and black, and one could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass upon the rocks. One could see lines and creases in the rocks. One could see the windows clearly; a dab of white on one of them, and a little tuft of green on the rock. A man had come out and looked at them through a glass and gone in again. So it was like that, James thought, the Lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these years; it was a stark tower on a bare rock. It satisfied him. It confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character. The old ladies, he thought, thinking of the garden at home, went dragging their chairs about on the lawn. Old Mrs Beckwith, for example, was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was and how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy, but as a matter of fact, James thought, looking at the Lighthouse stood there on its rock, it's like that. He looked at his father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight. They shared that knowledge. "We are driving before a gale -- we must sink," he began saying to himself, half aloud, exactly as his father said it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Ramsay had almost done reading. One hand hovered over the page as if to be in readiness to turn it the very instant he had finished it. He sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his hair about, extraordinarily exposed to everything. He looked very old. He looked, James thought, getting his head now against the Lighthouse, now against the waste of waters running away into the open, like some old stone lying on the sand; he looked as if he had become physically what was always at the back of both of their minds -- that loneliness which was for both of them the truth about things.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nobody seemed to have spoken for an age. Cam was tired of looking at the sea. Little bits of black cork had floated past; the fish were dead in the bottom of the boat. Still her father read, and James looked at him and she looked at him, and they vowed that they would fight tyranny to the death, and he went on reading quite unconscious of what they thought. It was thus that he escaped, she thought. Yes, with his great forehead and his great nose, holding his little mottled book firmly in front of him, he escaped. You might try to lay hands on him, but then like a bird, he spread his wings, he floated off to settle out of your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump. She gazed at the immense expanse of the sea. The island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer. It looked like the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover. Yet in its frailty were all those paths, those terraces, those bedrooms -- all those innumberable things. But as, just before sleep, things simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has power to assert itself, so, she felt, looking drowsily at the island, all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing, and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that across her mind. It was a hanging garden; it was a valley, full of birds, and flowers, and antelopes… She was falling asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="似乎好久没有人说话了。卡姆看海看得厌了。黑色软木浮子的小碎片漂了过去；船底的鱼已经死掉了。她的父亲仍旧在看书，詹姆斯看着他，她看着他，他们曾发誓要至死与暴行斗争，而他对他们的想法毫无所知，继续看他的书。他就是这样逃脱了的，她想：是的，他带着他那大脑门，大鼻子，把那本有杂色斑纹的小书坚定地举在面前，他逃脱了。你可能会试图抓住他，但他会像只小鸟一样展开翅膀，翩然飞到远远的你够不着的什么地方，停在某个荒凉的树桩上。她凝视着一望无际的大海。那个小岛已经变得这样小、看起来已经不再像一片叶子了。它像一块岩石的尖顶，一个大浪就能淹没掉。然而在它脆弱的躯体上有着那么多小径、平台、卧室——所有那些不可胜数的东西。但是如同即将入睡时的感觉那样，一切都变得简单化了，在无数的细节中只有一个细节有力量把自己突现出来，当她昏沉地看着那个小岛时，她就是这样感到所有那些小径和平台和卧室都在隐没消失，只剩下一只浅蓝色的香炉在她心里有节奏地摆来摆去。这是一个多级平台花园；这是个山谷，充满了小鸟、鲜花和羚羊……她渐渐睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They would soon be out of it, Mr Ramsay was saying to old Macalister; but their children would see some strange things. Macalister said he was seventy-five last March; Mr Ramsay was seventy-one. Macalister said he had never seen a doctor; he had never lost a tooth. And that's the way I'd like my children to live -- Cam was sure that her father was thinking that, for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her, as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived, that if she did not want it she should put it back in the parcel. She should not waste it. He said it so wisely, as if he knew so well all the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once, and then he gave her, from his own parcel, a gingerbread nut, as if he were a great Spanish gentleman, she thought, handing a flower to a lady at a window (so courteous his manner was). He was shabby, and simple, eating bread and cheese; and yet he was leading them on a great expedition where, for all she knew, they would be drowned.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks that it was very exciting -- it seemed as if they were doing two things at once; they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck. Would the water last? Would the provisions last? she asked herself, telling herself a story but knowing at the same time what was the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这当儿，他们正急速沿着礁石航行，让人十分兴奋——他们仿佛同时在做着两件事情：他们在阳光下在这儿享受午餐，同时也在风暴中沉船后逃向安全地带。淡水够维持他们吗？食物够吗？她问自己，给自己编述一个故事，但心里明白什么是真实情况。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I beneath a rougher sea, and if he did, they could not bear it; they would shriek aloud; they could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him; but to their surprise all he said was "Ah" as if he thought to himself. But why make a fuss about that? Naturally men are drowned in a storm, but it is a perfectly straightforward affair, and the depths of the sea (he sprinkled the crumbs from his sandwich paper over them) are only water after all. Then having lighted his pipe he took out his watch. He looked at it attentively; he made, perhaps, some mathematical calculation. At last he said, triumphantly:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我在波涛更为汹涌的海底，而如果他真这样做的话，他们可无法忍受；他们会大声尖叫；他们无法忍受他胸中沸腾着的激情的再一次爆发；但是使他们惊奇的是，他只说了声“啊”，仿佛在对自己说，干吗要大惊小怪？风暴中有人淹死是十分自然的事，简单明了，海底深处（他把包三明治的纸上的碎渣撒在了海里）也不过是水罢了。点燃了烟斗以后他拿出了怀表。他专注地看着表；也许他做了个算术运算。最后他得意地说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There! Cam thought, addressing herself silently to James. You've got it at last. For she knew that this was what James had been wanting, and she knew that now he had got it he was so pleased that he would not look at her or at his father or at any one. There he sat with his hand on the tiller sitting bolt upright, looking rather sulky and frowning slightly. He was so pleased that he was not going to let anybody share a grain of his pleasure. His father had praised him. They must think that he was perfectly indifferent. But you've got it now, Cam thought. buoyantly on long rocking waves which handed them on from one to another with an extraordinary lilt and exhilaration beside the reef. On the left a row of rocks showed brown through the water which thinned and became greener and on one, a higher rock, a wave incessantly broke and spurted a little column of drops which fell down in a shower. One could hear the slap of the water and the patter of falling drops and a kind of hushing and hissing sound from the waves rolling and gambolling and slapping the rocks as if they were wild creatures who were perfectly free and tossed and tumbled and sported like this for ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瞧！卡姆想着默默对詹姆斯说。你终于得到了。因为她知道这正是詹姆斯一直想得到的，她知道现在他得到了，会高兴得不去看她，也不看他的父亲或任何人。他坐在那里手抓着舵柄，身体笔直，神情阴沉，微皱着眉头。他非常高兴，不愿任何人分走一点点他的喜悦。他的父亲夸奖了他。他们一定会以为他对此毫不在乎。但是你现在得到了，卡姆想。他们已经抢风转变了航向，现在正在急速前进，轻快地在浪头上颠簸，滚滚而来的长浪以极其明快的节奏欢欣地把他们沿着暗礁从一个浪尖推送到又一个浪尖。船的左侧，一排呈现出棕色的岩石露出海面，岩石逐渐减少，也变得绿了一些，波浪不断撞击其中一块较高的岩石，浪花被击碎溅落，迸出一小股水珠，喷洒而下。你可以听见水的拍击声和水珠落下的嗒嗒声，以及海浪翻腾跳跃拍击岩石时发出的一种低沉的呼啸声，仿佛它们是群无拘无束的野兽，永远像这样翻腾打闹不止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Ramsay buttoned his coat, and turned up his trousers. He took the large, badly packed, brown paper parcel which Nancy had got ready and sat with it on his knee. Thus in complete readiness to land he sat looking back at the island. With his long-sighted eyes perhaps he could see the dwindled leaf-like shape standing on end on a plate of gold quite clearly. What could he see? Cam wondered. It was all a blur to her. What was he thinking now? she wondered. What was it he sought, so fixedly, so intently, so silently? They watched him, both of them, sitting bareheaded with his parcel on his knee staring and staring at the frail blue shape which seemed like the vapour of something that had burnt itself away. What do you want? they both wanted to ask. They both wanted to say, Ask us anything and we will give it you. But he did not ask them anything. He sat and looked at the island and he might be thinking, We perished, each alone, or he might be thinking, I have reached it. I have found it; but he said nothing. Then he put on his hat.</div>

He rose and stood in the bow of the boat, very straight and tall, for all the world, James thought, as if he were saying, "There is no God," and Cam thought, as if he were leaping into space, and they both rose to follow him as he sprang, lightly like a young man, holding his parcel, on to the rock.</div>
