<div class="line_en">She took after her mother, and not only physically. I sometimes have the feeling that her entire life was merely a continuation of her mother's, much as the course of a ball on the billiard table is merely the continuation of the player's arm movement.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe it came from the moment when the Prague businessman first praised his daughter's beauty. This girl was Teresa's mother, who was only three or four years old at the time. Her father said she looked like the virgin in Raphael's painting, and she firmly remembered this sentence. Later she went to middle school. She didn't listen to the teacher in class, but she was thinking about what kind of painting she was like.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the age of marriage, nine men proposed to her. One by one, they fell down beside her in a circle. Like a princess, she stood in the middle and didn't know which one to choose. The fifth is the richest, the sixth, the seventh, the fifth and the fifth. Nine people all kneel down to propose to her, nine people's knees are worn out blisters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到了谈婚论嫁的年龄，有九个男人向她求婚。一个个跪倒在她的身边，围成一圈。她像公主一样，站在中间不知道该选择哪一个。第一个求婚者最英俊，第二个最机智，第三个最富有，第四个最健康，第五个出身最高贵，第六个最会背诗，第七个曾周游世界，第八个会拉小提琴，第九个最具男子气概。九个人都一样跪着向她求婚，九个人的膝盖都磨出了泡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end, she chose the ninth one, not because he was the most masculine, but because when she had sex, she whispered to him, "be careful! Be careful But he deliberately did not take any measures, and did not find the doctor to do abortion for her, so that she had to marry him quickly. So Teresa was born. Countless relatives and friends came from all over the country, nestling in the cradle and teasing Teresa. My mother didn't make fun of it. She said nothing. She was thinking about the other eight suitors and felt that each was better than the ninth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终她选择了第九个，倒不是因为这个人最有男子气概，而是因为做爱的时候，她悄声叮嘱他：“小心！一定要小心！”但他故意没有采取任何措施，而且也没有及时找大夫给她做人流，弄得她不得不赶紧嫁给他。就这样特蕾莎降生了。数不清的亲友从全国各地赶来，依偎在摇篮边，逗着特蕾莎。母亲却没有去逗。她一句话也不说。她心里在想着另外八个求婚的，觉得每个都比第九个强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like her daughter, Theresa's mother loves to look in the mirror. One day, she found a wrinkle in the corner of her eyes and murmured that the original marriage was ridiculous. At this time, she met a man who had been divorced for several times, and she had never been guilty of such a crime. She hated suitors whose knees were blistered. This time, she wanted to get down on her knees and make love to someone else. So she knelt down in front of the swindler, left Teresa and her husband and left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和她女儿一样，特蕾莎母亲也特别爱照镜子。有一天，她发现眼角上有了皱纹，心里直嘀咕，当初的婚姻真是荒唐透顶。这时，她又遇到了一个男人，这人一点也没有男子气概，还犯过几次诈骗罪并有两次离婚史。她厌恶那些膝盖上跪出了泡的求婚者。这一回，她疯了似的想自己跪下来向别人求爱。于是，她跪倒在骗子跟前，抛下特蕾莎和丈夫走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The most manly man becomes the saddest man. Excessive grief makes him indifferent to everything. He talks all over the place and says what he thinks. The police were very angry with his nonsense, so they summoned him and sentenced him to prison. The house was sealed and Theresa was thrown out and had to go to her mother.</div>

Then one day she looked in the mirror again and saw that she was old and ugly.</div>
