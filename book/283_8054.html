<div class="line_en">The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have not been working uninterruptedly," he replied, "I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我又不是一直在修眼镜，”弗兰克答道。“我刚才帮费尔法克斯小姐把钢琴放稳。原来放得不大稳，我想是因为地板不平。你瞧，我们已经在一条琴腿底下垫上了纸。你真好，给请来了。我还有点担心你要急着回家呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他设法让爱玛坐在他身边，费心地给她挑了个最好的烤苹果，还请她帮帮忙，指点他修眼镜，直至简·费尔法克斯准备就绪，好再一次坐在钢琴跟前。爱玛心里猜疑，简所以没有马上准备好，是因为心绪不宁的关系。她刚得到这架钢琴不久，一触到它心里难免不激动，必须让头脑冷静一下才能弹奏。这种心情不管起因如何，爱玛只能表示同情，只能打定主意，决不能将其暴露给她旁边这个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="简终于开始演奏了。尽避开头几个小节弹得有气无力，但是钢琴的良好性能渐渐地充分发挥出来了。韦斯顿太太以前听得乐滋滋的，这次又听得乐滋滋的。爱玛跟她一起赞叹不已。还有那架钢琴，经过种种严格的鉴定，被宣称为上上品。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ," said Frank Churchill, with a smile at Emma, "the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you think so?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不管坎贝尔上校委托的什么人，”弗兰克·邱吉尔说，一边朝爱玛笑了笑，“这个人没有挑错。我在韦默斯常听人说起坎贝尔上校很有鉴赏力。我敢肯定，他和他那一伙人特别讲究高音键的柔和。我敢说，费尔法克斯小姐，他要么向给他挑选爸琴的朋友做了仔细的交代，要么亲自给布罗德伍德琴行写信。你看呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

I dare say they often think of you, and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to hand.

What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at work, if one talks at all; -- your real workmen, I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word-Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.

<div class="line_en">"Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it? -- Cramer. -- And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell, was not it? -- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这支曲子我从没听过，你熟悉吗？克雷默出版的（译注：克雷默：系德国钢琴教师兼演奏家克雷默（1771—1858）创办的一家著名的音乐出版社）。这是新出版的一本爱尔兰乐曲集，从这样一个地方得到这样一本乐曲集，这是可以料得到的。那是跟钢琴一起送来的。坎贝尔上校想得真周到，对吧？他知道费尔法克斯小姐在这儿搞不到乐谱。我特别赞赏他这份情意，说明完全是发自内心的关心。不是敷衍塞责，不是草草了事。只有出自一片真心，才能做到这一步。”">查看中文翻译</div>
