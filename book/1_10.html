<div class="line_en">Birds were chirping everywhere -- in the trees and in the air, in bush and thicket. They were busily occupied with their morning pursuits.

<div class="line_en">Sophie went down to the water's edge. It was very muddy in many places, but then she noticed a rowboat. It was drawn halfway out of the water. There was a pair of oars in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲走到湖畔。这里有多处泥泞，不过后来她发现了一条小船，船身有一半在水中，里面还有一对桨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie looked around. Whatever she did, it would be impossible to get around the lake to the red cabin without getting her shoes soaked. She went resolutely over to the boat and pushed it into the water. Then she climbed aboard, set the oars in the rowlocks, and rowed across the lake. The boat soon touched the opposite bank. Sophie went ashore and tried to pull the boat up after her. The bank was much steeper here than the opposite bank had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲环顾四周。看来无论她怎么做，都无法在不把鞋子弄湿的情况下，渡湖到小红屋那边。于是，她一咬牙，走到小船那儿，将它推到水中。然后她爬上船，将桨固定在桨架上，开始划过湖面。不一会儿，船便到了对岸。苏菲跨上岸，想把船拖上来。此处的湖岸要比刚才那边陡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lake was no bigger than a soccer field. Over on the other side she could see a red-painted cabin in a small clearing surrounded by silver birches. A faint wisp of smoke was rising from the chimney.</div>

<div class="line_en">On a big dining table stood a typewriter, some books, a couple of pencils, and a pile of paper. A smaller table and two chairs stood by the window that overlooked the lake. Apart from that there was very little furniture, although the whole of one wall was lined with book-shelves filled with books. Above a white chest of drawers hung a large round mirror in a heavy brass frame. It looked very old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客厅里的一张大餐桌上放了一台打字机、几本书、几支铅笔和一沓纸。面湖的窗前有一张较小的桌子和两把椅子。除此之外，屋里很少家具，不过有一整面墙都是书架，上面放满了书。一个白色的五斗柜上方挂了一面圆形的大镜子，外围镶着巨大的铜框，看起来已经是老古董了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On one of the walls hung two pictures. One was an oil painting of a white house which lay a stone's throw from a little bay with a red boathouse. Between the house and the boathouse was a sloping garden with an apple tree, a few thick bushes, and some rocks. A dense fringe of birch trees framed the garden like a garland. The title of the painting was "Bjerkely."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外一面墙上挂着两幅画。一幅是油画作品，画里有一个建有红色船坞的小港湾，距港湾不远处有一栋白屋。船库与白屋之间是一个有点坡度的花园，种了一株苹果树、几棵浓密的灌木，此外还有几块岩石。一排浓密的桦树像花环一般围绕着这座花园。画的题名为“柏客来”（Bjerkely）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie went back to the living room. Another door led to a tiny bedroom. On the floor next to the bed there were a couple of blankets in a thick bundle. Sophie discovered some golden hairs on the blankets. Here was the evidence! Now Sophie knew that the occupants of the cabin were Alberto Knox and Hermes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲回到客厅。另外一扇门通向一间小小的卧室，里面有一张床，旁边的地板上放着两、三条捆得厚厚的毯子。苏菲在毯子上发现几根金色的毛发。这就是证据了！现在苏菲知道住在这栋小木屋里的就是艾伯特和汉密士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beside that painting hung an old portrait of a man sitting in a chair by a window. He had a book in his lap. This picture also had a little bay with trees and rocks in the background. It looked as though it had been painted several hundred years ago. The title of the picture was "Berkeley." The painter's name was Smibert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这幅油画旁挂了另一幅古老的肖像画。画的是一个男人坐在窗边的椅子上，怀中放了一本书，背景也是一个有树、有岩石的小港湾。这幅画看来像是几百年前画的，题名是“柏克莱”（Berkeley）。画家的名字叫史密伯特（Smibert）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back in the living room, Sophie stood in front of the mirror. The glass was matte and scratched, and her reflection correspondingly blurred. Sophie began to make faces at herself like she did at home in the bathroom. Her reflection did exactly the same, which was only to be expected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再回到客厅后，苏菲站在五斗柜上方的镜子前。镜面已经失去光泽，而且刮痕累累，因此她在镜中的影像也显得模糊不清。苏菲开始对着镜中的自己扮鬼脸，就像她在家中浴室里做的一般。镜中人也一如预期的跟着她的动作做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie continued her investigation. A door led from the living room to a small kitchen. Someone had just done the dishes. Plates and glasses were piled on a tea towel, some of them still glistening with drops of soapy water. There was a tin bowl on the floor with some leftover scraps of food in it. Whoever lived here had a pet, a dog or a cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲继续勘查这座小木屋。客厅有一扇门通向一间小厨房。不久前这里刚有人洗过碗，盘子与玻璃杯都堆在一条茶巾上，其中几个碗杯上面还有几滴闪闪发光的肥皂水。地板上有一个锡碗，里面放着一些剩饭剩菜。这房子的主人一定养了狗或猫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But all of a sudden something scary happened. Just once -- in the space of a split second -- Sophie saw quite clearly that the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes. Sophie started back in fright. If she herself had winked -- how could she have seen the other girl wink? And not only that, it seemed as though the other girl had winked at Sophie as if to say: I can see you, Sophie. I am in here, on the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，一件骇人的事发生了。有一刹那，苏菲很清楚地看到镜中的女孩同时眨着双眼。苏菲吓得倒退了一步。如果是她自己同时眨动双眼，那她怎么看到镜中的影像呢？不仅如此，那个女孩眨眼的样子仿佛是在告诉苏菲：“我可以看到你喔！我在这里，在另外一边。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie felt her heart beating, and at the same time she heard a dog barking in the distance. Hermes! She had to get out of here at once. Then she noticed a green wallet on the chest of drawers under the mirror. It contained a hundred-crown note, a fifty, and a school I. D. card. It showed a picture of a girl with fair hair. Under the picture was the girl's name: Hilde Moller Knag…</div>

<div class="line_en">The barking was getting closer. But worst of all was that the boat was gone. After a second or two she saw it, adrift halfway across the lake. One of the oars was floating beside it. All because she hadn't been able to pull it completely up on land. She heard the dog barking quite nearby now and saw movements between the trees on the other side of the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狗叫声愈来愈近。但最糟的是小船不见了。一两秒钟后，她才看到它，原来它正在湖心漂浮，一只桨也在船边漂着。这都是因为她那时无力将它拖上岸的缘故。她听到狗叫声已经逼近，同时湖对岸的树林间也有一些动静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie didn't hesitate any longer. With the big envelope in her hand, she plunged into the bushes behind the cabin. Soon she was having to wade through marshy ground, sinking in several times to well above her ankles. But she had to keep going. She had to get home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dear Philosopher, It was me who was in your cabin early Sunday morning. I wanted so much to meet you and discuss some of the philosophic problems. For the moment I am a Plato fan, but I am not so sure he was right about ideas or pattern pictures existing in another reality. Of course they exist in our souls, but I think -- for the moment anyway -- that this is a different thing. I have to admit too that I am not altogether convinced of the immortality of the soul. Personally, I have no recollections from my former lives. If you could convince me that my deceased grandmother's soul is happy in the world of ideas, I would be most grateful.</div>

<div class="line_en">This question was just as tricky as the old riddle of the chicken and the egg. There would be no chicken without the egg, and no egg without the chicken. Was it really just as complicated to figure out whether the chicken or the "idea" chicken came first? Sophie understood what Plato meant. He meant that the "idea" chicken had existed in the world of ideas long before chickens existed in the sensory world. According to Plato, the soul had "seen" the "idea" chicken before it took up residence in a body. But wasn't this just where Sophie thought Plato must be mistaken? How could a person who had never seen a live chicken or a picture of a chicken ever have any "idea" of a chicken? Which brought her to the next question:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个问题就像“鸡生蛋还是蛋生鸡”这个老问题一样难以回答。没有蛋就没有鸡，但没有鸡也无从有蛋。“先有鸡还是先有这个观念”这个问题真的一样复杂吗？苏菲了解柏拉图的意思。他是说早在感官世界出现鸡以前，“鸡”这个观念已经存在于观念世界多时了。根据柏拉图的说法，灵魂在寄宿于人体之前已经见过“观念鸡”。不过这就是苏菲认为柏拉图可能讲错的地方。一个从来没有看过一只活生生的鸡，也从来没有看过鸡的图片的人怎么可能会有任何有关鸡的“观念”呢。这又让她想到下一个问题：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is the difference between a plant, an animal, and a human?" Sophie could immediately see very clear differences.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“植物、动物与人类之间有何区别？”答案太明显了，苏菲可以立即指出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For instance, she did not think a plant had a very complicated emotional life. Who had ever heard of a bluebell with a broken heart? A plant grows, takes nourishment, and produces seeds so that it can reproduce itself. That's about all one could say about plants. Sophie concluded that everything that applied to plants also applied to animals and humans. But animals had other attributes as well. They could move, for example. (When did a rose ever run a marathon?) It was a bit harder to point to any differences between animals and humans. Humans could think, but couldn't animals do so as well? Sophie was convinced that her cat Sherekan could think. At least, it could be very calculating. But could it reflect on philosophical questions? Could a cat speculate about the difference between a plant, an animal, and a human? Hardly! A cat could probably be either contented or unhappy, but did it ever ask itself if there was a God or whether it had an immortal soul? Sophie thought that was extremely doubtful. But the same problem was raised here as with the baby and the innate ideas. It was just as difficult to talk to a cat about such questions as it would be to discuss them with a baby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="例如，她认为植物没有复杂的感情生活。谁听过风铃草伤心欲碎？植物生长、吸收养分，然后制造种子以繁衍下一代。除此之外，就没有什么了。苏菲的结论是：植物所有的，动物与人类也都有，但动物还有其他的特色。例如，动物可以移动，（谁听说过一株玫瑰可以跑六十公尺？）至于动物与人类之间的区别就比较难说了。人类能够思考，动物也会吗？苏菲相信她的猫咪雪儿懂得如何思考。至少它很会为自己打算，但是它会思索哲学问题吗？一只猫会去思考植物、动物与人类之间的差异吗？这是不太可能的。一只猫可能很快乐，也可能不快乐，但它会问自己“世间有没有上帝”或“猫儿有没有不朽的灵魂”这类问题吗？苏菲认为这是非常令人怀疑的。不过，话说回来，这个问题就像婴儿有没有自己的想法一样难以回答。就像我们很难和婴儿讨论这类问题一样，我们也很难跟一只猫谈这些问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Are we born with innate "ideas"? Most unlikely, thought Sophie. She could hardly imagine a newborn baby being especially well equipped with ideas. One could obviously never be sure, because the fact that the baby had no language did not necessarily mean that it had no ideas in its head. But surely we have to see things in the world before we can know anything about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“人是否生来就有一些观念呢？”苏菲认为，这是不太可能的。她很难想象一个初生的婴儿有很多自己的想法。当然，这点我们无法确定，因为婴儿虽不会讲话，也并不一定意味着他的脑袋里没有任何想法。不过我们一定要先看到世间之物，才能对这些事物有所了解吧！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why does it rain?" Sophie shrugged her shoulders. It probably rains because seawater evaporates and the clouds condense into raindrops. Hadn't she learnt that in the third grade? Of course, one could always say that it rains so that plants and animals can grow. But was that true? Had a shower any actual purpose?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天为何会下雨？”苏菲耸了耸肩膀。下雨是因为海水蒸发，云层凝聚成雨滴的缘故。这个道理她不是三年级就学过了吗？当然，我们也可以说天之所以下雨是为了要让植物、动物能够生长。但这是真的吗？天空下雨真的有任何目的吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last question definitely had something to do with purpose: "What does it take to live a good life?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The philosopher had written something about this quite early on in the course. Everybody needs food, warmth, love, and care. Such basics were the primary condition for a good life, at any rate. Then he had pointed out that people also needed to find answers to certain philosophical questions. It was probably also quite important to have a job you liked. If you hated traffic, for instance, you would not be very happy as a taxi driver. And if you hated doing homework it would probably be a bad idea to become a teacher. Sophie loved animals and wanted to be a vet. But in any case she didn't think it was necessary to win a million in the lottery to live a good life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哲学家在课程开始不久时曾经谈过这个问题。每一个人都需要食物、温暖、爱与关怀。这类事物是良好生活的基本条件。接着哲学家指出，人们也需要为一些哲学问题寻找答案。除此之外，拥有一份自己喜欢的工作可能也是很重要的。举例来说，如果你讨厌塞车，那么你要是当个计程车司机绝对不会快乐。如果你不喜欢做作业，那么你也许不太适合当老师。苏菲喜欢动物，想当兽医。不过，无论如何，她不认为人一定要中百万大奖才能过得好。">查看中文翻译</div>
