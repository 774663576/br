<div class="line_en">"This is London rain," said Maxim when we left, "you wait, the sun will be shining for you when we come to Manderley"; and he was right, for the clouds left us at Exeter, they rolled away behind us, leaving a great blue sky above our heads and a white road in front of us.</div>

<div class="line_en">We came to Manderley in early May, arriving, so Maxim said, with the first swallows and the bluebells. It would be the best moment, before the full flush of summer, and in the valley the azaleas would be prodigal of scent, and the blood-red rhododendrons in bloom. We motored, I remember, leaving London in the morning in a heavy shower of rain, coming to Manderley about five o'clock, in time for tea. I can see myself now, unsuitably dressed as usual, although a bride of seven weeks, in a tan-coloured stockinette frock, a small fur known as a stone marten round my neck, and over all a shapeless mackintosh, far too big for me and dragging to my ankles. It was, I thought, a gesture to the weather, and the length added inches to my height. I clutched a pair of gauntlet gloves in my hands, and carried a large leather handbag.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was glad to see the sun, for in superstitious fashion I looked upon rain as an omen of ill-will, and the leaden skies of London had made me silent.</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew then that he had mistaken my silence for fatigue, and it had not occurred to him I dreaded this arrival at Manderley as much as I had longed for it in theory. Now the moment was upon me I wished it delayed. I wanted to draw up at some wayside inn and stay there, in a coffee-room, by an impersonal fire. I wanted to be a traveller on the road, a bride in love with her husband. Not myself coming to Manderley for the first time, the wife of Maxim de Winter. We passed many friendly villages where the cottage windows had a kindly air. A woman, holding a baby in her arms, smiled at me from a doorway, while a man clanked across a road to a well, carrying a pail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我这才知道，他是以为我觉得疲乏，所以不说话，根本没想到此刻我害怕到达曼陀丽的程度决不亚于我在理论上对她的向往。一旦这个时刻临近，我倒又希望它往后挪。最好我们在路边随便找家客店，一起呆在咖啡室里，傍着不带个性特点的炉火。我宁愿自己是个过往旅店，一个热爱丈夫的新娘，而不是初来曼陀丽的迈克西姆—德温特的妻子。我们驶过许多景色明快的村落，农舍的窗户都显出厚道好客的样子。一个农妇，怀抱婴孩，站在门口向我微笑；一个男子，手提吊桶，当啷当啷穿过小路，朝井边走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Feeling better?" said Maxim, and I smiled at him, taking his hand, thinking how easy it was for him, going to his own home, wandering into the hall, picking up letters, ringing a bell for tea, and I wondered how much he guessed of my nervousness, and whether his question "Feeling better?" meant that he understood. "Never mind, we'll soon be there. I expect you want your tea," he said, and he let go my hand because we had reached a bend in the road, and must slow down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“觉得好过些吗？”迈克西姆问我。我朝他笑笑，执住他的手，心想对他说来，回自己的家该是何其轻松自如：信步走进大厅，随手捡起积压的信件，按铃吩咐送上茶点。可是对于我的局促不安，他能猜出几分？他刚才问我，“感到好过些吗？”这是不是说他理解我此刻的心情？“没关系，很快就到了。我看你需要用些茶点。”他放开我的手，因为前面是一个弯道，得放慢车速。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wished we could have been one with them, perhaps their neighbours, and that Maxim could lean over a cottage gate in the evenings, smoking a pipe, proud of a very tall hollyhock he had grown himself, while I bustled in my kitchen, clean as a pin, laying the table for supper. There would be an alarm clock on the dresser ticking loudly, and a row of shining plates, while after supper Maxim would read his paper, boots on the fender, and I reach for a great pile of mending in the dresser drawer. Surely it would be peaceful and steady, that way of living, and easier, too, demanding no set standard?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我多么希望我俩也成为他们中的一分子，或者做他们的邻人也行。晚上，迈克西姆斜靠在农舍门上，抽着烟斗，为自己亲手种植的葵薯长得茁壮高大而自豪。我呢？我在打扫得于干净净的厨房里忙乎，铺好桌子，准备吃晚饭。梳妆柜上，一架闹钟滴答滴答走得安详。还有一排擦得亮堂堂的菜盘。饭后，迈克西姆读他的报纸，靴子搁在火炉的挡架上。我则从柜子抽屉里取出一大堆缝补活计。无可怀疑，那样的生活是安详而有规律的，还轻松自如，不必按刻板的准则行事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I forced a smile, and did not answer him, aware now of a stab of panic, an uneasy sickness that could not be controlled. Gone was my glad excitement, vanished my happy pride. I was like a child brought to her first school, or a little untrained maid who has never left home before, seeking a situation. Any measure of self-possession I had gained hitherto during the brief seven weeks of marriage, was like a rag now, fluttering before the wind; it seemed to me that even the most elementary knowledge of behaviour was unknown to me now, I should not know my right hand from my left, whether to stand or sit, what spoons and forks to use at dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我强作笑容，没有答话。我只感到一阵惊惶，一种无由控制的眩晕。那种狂喜的激动和幸福的自豪感都一股脑儿作了烟云散。我像一个被人牵着第一天上学去的幼童，也像一个初次离家外出求职的稚嫩的年轻使女。结婚以来短短七个星期中好不容易学到的那点微不足道的自制力，这会儿简直成了在风中发抖的一块碎布片。我连最起码的行为准则似乎也忘了个精光，待会儿可能左右手不分，应该站着还是坐下，吃饭时应该使用何种汤匙和餐叉，都会乱了套。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only two miles further," said Maxim; "you see that great belt of trees on the brow of the hill there, sloping to the valley, with a scrap of sea beyond? That's Manderley, in there. Those are the woods."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有两英里了，”迈克西姆告诉我。“你看见那边一长排大树吗？从那儿的山顶倾斜着伸向山谷，过去一点就是大海。那就是曼陀丽，那些树木就是曼陀丽的林子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The road curved, and before us, on the left, were two high iron gates beside a lodge, open wide to the long drive beyond. As we drove through I saw faces peering through the dark window of the lodge, and a child ran round from the back, staring curiously. I shrank back against the seat, my heart beating quickly, knowing why the faces were at the window, and why the child stared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车转入弯道，左前方出现两扇大铁门，旁边是看门人的屋子。铁门大开着，进了门便是长长的车道。车进门时，我看到门房黑洞洞的窗子后面有几张窥探的脸。一个小孩从屋后绕出来，睁大眼睛好奇地望着。我慌忙往椅子里一缩，心怦怦直跳。我知道这些人为什么探头探脑，小孩子为什么瞪眼张望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They wanted to see what I was like. I could imagine them now, talking excitedly, laughing in the little kitchen. "Only caught sight of the top of her hat," they would say, "she wouldn't show her face. Oh, well, we'll know by tomorrow. Word will come from the house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们是想看看我的模样，这会儿也许已起劲地在小厨房里哄笑着议论开啦：“只看到她那帽顶，”他们会说。“她不肯把脸露出来。不打紧，赶明儿就可以知道这人的长相，宅子里准会有消息传出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not answer him, for I was thinking of that self who long ago bought a picture postcard in a village shop, and came out into the bright sunlight twisting it in her hands, pleased with her purchase, thinking "This will do for my album. 'Manderley', what a lovely name." And now I belonged here, this was my home. I would write letters to people saying, "We shall be down at Manderley all the summer, you must come and see us," and I would walk along this drive, strange and unfamiliar to me now, with perfect knowledge, conscious of every twist and turn, marking and approving where the gardeners had worked, here a cutting back of the shrubs, there a lopping of a branch, calling at the lodge by the iron gates on some friendly errand, saying, "Well, how's the leg today?" while the old woman, curious no longer, bade me welcome to her kitchen. I envied Maxim, careless and at ease, and the little smile on his lips which meant he was happy to be coming home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有吭声。我又想到多年前在那家乡村小铺里买彩图明信片的情景：手指搓着明信片，我走出铺子，来到明亮的阳光下，心里暗暗得意：把这画片收进影集倒挺合适，“曼陀丽”，多美的名字啊！可现在曼陀丽竟成了我的家！我将给朋友们写信：“整个夏天我们将呆在曼陀丽，请你们一定来玩。”这车道现在对我说来既新奇又陌生，但以后我会非常熟悉它，在这儿散步时知道什么地方有一个转弯，什么地方有一个拐角；园丁在哪儿修剪过灌木，在哪儿截去一枝，我能马上看得出来。我顺着车道走进铁门旁的门房，嘘寒问暖：“今天腿觉得怎么样？”那时，那位老太太将不再对我表示好奇，她会欢迎我去厨房作客。我真羡慕迈克西姆，无忧无虑，泰然自若，嘴角挂着微笑，这表明回家来他很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps he guessed something of my shyness at last, for he took my hand, and kissed it, and laughed a little, even as he spoke. "You mustn't mind if there's a certain amount of curiosity," he said; "everyone will want to know what you are like. They have probably talked of nothing else for weeks. You've only got to be yourself and they will all adore you. And you don't have to worry about the house, Mrs Danvers does everything. Just leave it all to her. She'll be stiff with you at first, I dare say, she's an extraordinary character, but you mustn't let it worry you. It's just her manner. See those shrubs? It's like a blue wall along here when the hydrangeas are in bloom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许，对我的怯生的窘态，他终于有几分觉察，所以就抓起我的手，吻了一下，一边笑着说：“这儿的人有些好奇，你可别介意。大家都想看看你是什么样子，也许几个星期以来，他们非此莫谈。你只要态度真诚自然，他们肯定都会喜欢你，至于家务，你一点不用过问，一切全由丹弗斯太太料理，就让她去操持好了。我看，一开始她会对你摆出生硬的态度。这人的性格很怪。可你不必在乎，她的作风就是这样。看到那些灌木吗？紫阳花开的时候，这一带的灌木丛就像一堵深蓝色的围墙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="什么时候我也能像他那样泰然自若，嘴角也能挂上这样的微笑？看来这是太遥远了。我多么希望马上就能达到这一步。可当时我觉得自己慌得傻了眼。只要能摆脱这样的窘态，我甚至宁愿变成一个头发花白，步履蹒跚，久居曼陀丽的老妇人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gates had shut to with a crash behind us, the dusty high road was out of sight, and I became aware that this was not the drive I had imagined would be Manderley's, this was not a broad and spacious thing of gravel, flanked with neat turf at either side, kept smooth with rake and brush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁门砰地一声在我们后面关上，再也看不见尘土飞扬的公路。我发现车道与自己想象中的样子很不相同。我原以为曼陀丽的车道一定是条宽阔的大路，上面铺着沙砾，两边是齐整的草坪；路面经常用耙子和扫帚整理，弄得很平滑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This drive twisted and turned as a serpent, scarce wider in places than a path, and above our heads was a great colonnade of trees, whose branches nodded and intermingled with one another, making an archway for us, like the roof of a church. Even the midday sun would not penetrate the interlacing of those green leaves, they were too thickly entwined, one with another, and only little flickering patches of warm light would come in intermittent waves to dapple the drive with gold. It was very silent, very still. On the high road there had been a gay west wind blowing in my face, making the grass on the hedges dance in unison, but here there was no wind. Even the engine of the car had taken a new note, throbbing low, quieter than before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条路弯弯曲曲，像条蛇似地扭曲向前，在有些地方并不比一条小径宽阔多少。道旁两排大树，枝条摇曳，交错纠缠，形成教堂穹隆般的浓荫，我们就好比在拱道上穿行。绿叶混成一片，浓密异常，即使正午的太阳也无法透过，只能间或在车道上投下一些斑斑驳驳、时隐时现的温暖金光。四周非常静，鸦雀无声。在公路上曾吹着一阵西风，它欢快地拂着我的脸，使路边的青草一齐弯腰低舞，可是在车道上却一丝儿风也没有。甚至汽车的发动机也变了调子，它低声哼哧，不再像刚才那样放肆轰鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly I saw a clearing in the dark drive ahead, and a patch of sky, and in a moment the dark trees had thinned, the nameless shrubs had disappeared, and on either side of us was a wall of colour, blood-red, reaching far above our heads. We were amongst the rhododendrons. There was something bewildering, even shocking, about the suddenness of their discovery. The woods had not prepared me for them. They startled me with their crimson faces, massed one upon the other in incredible profusion, showing no leaf, no twig, nothing but the slaughterous red, luscious and fantastic, unlike any rhododendron plant I had seen before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，我看见在幽暗的车道前面有一小片开朗的天空，顿时，黑糊糊的林子开始变得稀疏，那种无名的灌木丛也不见了。道旁是远远高出人头的一堵血红色的墙，原来我们已来到石南花丛中。石南出现得那么突然，不但把人弄得不知置身何处，甚至叫你大吃一惊。刚才汽车行在进林子里，我一点没想到会出现这样的奇景。石南花红得像鲜血，着实吓了我一跳。成团成簇的石南，茂盛得难以置信，看不见叶子，也看不见枝干，只有一片象征着杀戮的血红色，因为过分的浓艳，显得非常怪异，完全不像我以前见过的石南花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On we went, over a little bridge that spanned a narrow stream, and still this drive that was no drive twisted and turned like an enchanted ribbon through the dark and silent woods, penetrating even deeper to the very heart surely of the forest itself, and still there was no clearing, no space to hold a house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们继续前行，驶过一座小桥，桥下是一条狭溪。这条根本不像汽车道的小路还在向前蜿蜒伸展，就像被使了什么魔法的一根缎带，穿过黑压压的沉寂的树丛，无疑正深入林子的中心。左右看不到豁然开朗的空地，看不到房屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the drive descended to the valley so the trees came in upon us, great beeches with lovely smooth white stems, lifting their myriad branches to one another, and other trees, trees I could not name, coming close, so close that I could touch them with my hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车道倾斜着伸向山谷，大群树木迎面压来，其中有魁梧巨大的榉树，白色的躯干光滑可爱，擎托着一根又一根数不清的枝权。还有许多我叫不出名字的树木。它们迎面压来，我只要一伸手就可触到它们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The length of it began to nag at my nerves; it must be this turn, I thought, or round that further bend; but as I leant forward in my seat I was for ever disappointed, there was no house, no field, no broad and friendly garden, nothing but the silence and deep woods. The lodge gates were a memory, and the high road something belonging to another time, another world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车道漫漫，老是不见尽头，我的神经开始受不住了。我想，转过这个弯，或者再往前一点，绕个圈，一定就能看到尽头。但是每当我从椅上挺起身子，总是又一次失望：看不见房屋和田野，看不见令人宽慰的开阔的花园，周围仍是一片死寂的密林。两扇大铁门已经成为逝去的记忆，门外的公路则更遥远，似乎已属另一个世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I told him "Yes," a little breathlessly, uncertain whether I was speaking the truth or not, for to me a rhododendron was a homely, domestic thing, strictly conventional, mauve or pink in colour, standing one beside the other in a neat round bed. And these were monsters, rearing to the sky, massed like a battalion, too beautiful I thought, too powerful; they were not plants at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喘着气答道：“喜欢。”是不是真心话，我自己也不知道。我一向把石南看作一种普普通通的家花，或呈紫色，或呈浅红，整齐地排列在圆形花圃中。可是这儿的石南花根本不像植物，而是一群高耸的密集巨怪，美得反常，大得出奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were not far from the house now, I saw the drive broaden to the sweep I had expected, and with the blood-red wall still flanking us on either side, we turned the last corner, and so came to Manderley. Yes, there it was, the Manderley I had expected, the Manderley of my picture postcard long ago. A thing of grace and beauty, exquisite and faultless, lovelier even than I had ever dreamed, built in its hollow of smooth grassland and mossy lawns, the terraces sloping to the gardens, and the gardens to the sea. As we drove up to the wide stone steps and stopped before the open door, I saw through one of the mullioned windows that the hall was full of people, and I heard Maxim swear under his breath. "Damn that woman," he said; "she knows perfectly well I did not want this sort of thing," and he put on the brakes with a jerk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我们离宅子已经不远。果然不出我所料，车道由窄变宽，向一片开阔地伸去。在两边血红的石南花的簇拥之下，我们拐了最后一个弯，终于到达曼陀丽！啊，曼陀丽，果然是我想象中的模样，多年前那彩图明信片上的雄伟大宅，优雅，精美，一无瑕疵，比我梦中见到的形象更加完美！宅子由平坦的草地和绒毯似的草坪环绕，座落其间；庭院平台倾斜着伸向花园，花园又通往大海。我们向宽大的石阶驶去，最后在敞开的正门前停车。这时透过一扇带竖框的窗子，我看见大厅里全是人。我听到迈克西姆低声骂了一句：“这鬼女人，她明明知道我不喜欢这一套。”接着便猛地把车刹住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

She stooped to pick them up, and as she handed them to me I saw a little smile of scorn upon her lips, and I guessed at once she considered me ill-bred.

The knowledge of this chilled me; how narrow a chance had stood between me and what might-have-been, for he would have sat here to his tea, as he sat now, continuing his home life as he would in any case, and perhaps he would not have thought of me much, not with regret anyway, while I, in New York, playing bridge with Mrs Van Hopper, would wait day after day for a letter that never came.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't mind her," he said; "she's an extraordinary character in many ways, and possibly not very easy for another woman to get on with. You mustn't worry about it. If she really makes herself a nuisance we'll get rid of her. But she's efficient, you know, and will take all housekeeping worries off your hands. I dare say she's a bit of a bully to the staff. She doesn't dare bully me though. I'd have given her the sack long ago if she had tried."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别管她，”他说。“从很多方面看，这人是有点古怪。别的女人想要跟她处好关系，看来挺不容易。对于这一点，你切不要注意。如果此人实在惹你讨厌，把她赶走得了。不过，你知道，她办事干练，可以代你管家，免得你操心。我看她对其他仆人一定相当霸道，只是还没敢霸到我头上来。她要是敢对我放肆，我早就让她滚蛋了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let's forget about Mrs Danvers," he said; "she doesn't interest me very much, I'm afraid. Come along, and let me show you something of Manderley."</div>

<div class="line_en">My footsteps no longer sounded foolish on the stone flags of the hall, for Maxim's nailed shoes made far more noise than mine, and the pattering feet of the two dogs was a comfortable, pleasing note.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的脚步落在大厅的石板上不再发出异样难堪的响声。这会儿迈克西姆打着钉子的皮鞋发出的声音比我的脚步响得多。还有那两条狗啪嗒啪嗒的脚步声，听着既使人安适，又很悦耳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was glad, too, because it was the first evening and we had only been back a little while and the showing of the pictures had taken time, when Maxim, looking at the clock, said it was too late to change for dinner, so that I was spared the embarrassment of Alice, the maid, asking what I should wear, and of her helping me to dress, and myself walking down that long flight of stairs to the hall, cold, with bare shoulders, in a dress that Mrs Van Hopper had given me because it did not suit her daughter. I had dreaded the formality of dinner in that austere dining-room, and now, because of the little fact that we had not changed, it was quite all right, quite easy, just the same as when we had dined together in restaurants. I was comfortable in my stockinette dress, I laughed and talked about things we had seen in Italy and France, we even had the snapshots on the table, and Frith and the footman were impersonal people, as the waiters had been; they did not stare at me as Mrs Danvers had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使我高兴的另一个原因是，这是我俩在曼陀丽度过的第一个夜晚。我们刚回家就忙着浏览墙上的绘画，花去不少时间，所以迈克西姆看看钟说，时间来不及了，晚饭前不必更衣。这么一来，省得我受窘。要不然，那个名叫艾丽斯的使女肯定要问我换哪一套衣服，还要帮我穿着。而我就只得穿上范—霍珀夫人赐的那套衣服（这套衣服她女儿穿着不合身），裸着双肩，忍着寒冷，走下长长的一段楼梯，到大厅去吃饭。我方才就一直担心，生怕一本正经坐在这庄严肃穆的餐厅里用膳。可现在，因为不用更衣，一切又变得轻松而自然，同两人在外面上餐馆没什么两样。穿着原来的紧身衣，我觉得舒服。我笑着谈论在意大利和法国的见闻，我们还把旅途拍的照片放在桌上。弗里思和跟班就像餐馆里没有个性的侍者一样，他们不会像丹弗斯太太那样瞪眼看我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not see Mrs Danvers again that evening and we did not talk about her any more. I felt happier when I had dismissed her from my thoughts, less of an interloper, and as we wandered about the rooms downstairs, and looked at the pictures, and Maxim put his arm around my shoulder, I began to feel more like the self I wanted to become, the self I had pictured in my dreams, who made Manderley her home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我再也没见到丹弗斯太太，我俩也没再谈论这个人。思想上已把她驱开，我觉得轻松多了，那种把自己看作外来侵犯者的感觉也才淡漠一些。而当迈克西姆搂着我的肩，带我在楼下的房间里四处浏览的时候，我才开始觉得自己终于有点儿像理想中的角色，开始把曼陀丽当作自己的家了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat in the library after dinner, and presently the curtains were drawn, and more logs thrown on the fire; it was cool for May, I was thankful for the warmth that came from the steady burning logs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim made instinctively now for the chair on the left of the open fireplace, and stretched out his hand for the papers. He settled one of the broad cushions behind his head, and lit a cigarette. "This is his routine," I thought, "this is what he always does: this has been his custom now for years."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆本能地朝壁炉左方他的位子上走去，伸手拿起报纸。他把一个宽大的杭垫塞在脑袋后边，点燃一支香烟。我暗暗想：“这是他的老习惯，多少年来他每天都这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And as I sat there, brooding, my chin in my hands, fondling the soft ears of one of the spaniels, it came to me that I was not the first one to lounge there in possession of the chair; someone had been before me, and surely left an imprint of her person on the cushions, and on the arm where her hand had rested. Another one had poured the coffee from that same silver coffee pot, had placed the cup to her lips, had bent down to the dog, even as I was doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐在一边，双手托着腮帮子沉思。我爱怜地抚摸着长耳狗柔软的耳朵。这时我突然想到，我并不是第一个懒洋洋靠在这张椅子上的人。在我之前，已有人坐过这椅子，椅垫上肯定留下过她身子的印痕；她的手曾搁在这儿的扶手上；她曾从同一具银质咖啡壶中往外斟咖啡，把杯子送到唇边；同我此刻的姿势一样，她也曾俯身去爱抚长耳狗…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Unconsciously, I shivered as though someone had opened the door behind me and let a draught into the room. I was sitting in Rebecca's chair, I was leaning against Rebecca's cushion, and the dog had come to me and laid his head upon my knee because that had been his custom, and he remembered, in the past, she had given sugar to him there.</div>
