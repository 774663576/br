<div class="line_en">This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass. The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine. Arable lands arc few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major. Such is the Vale of Blackmoor.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround it -- except perhaps during the droughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry ways.</div>

<div class="line_en">The forests have departed, but some old customs of their shades remain. Many, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form. The May-Day dance, for instance, was to be discerned on the afternoon under notice, in the guise of the club revel, or 'club-walking', as it was there called.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="茂密的森林已经消失了，但是森林浓荫下曾经有过的一些古老风俗依然还在。不过风俗犹存，但许多已经改换了形式，加上了伪装。例如，已经通知下午举行的五朔节舞会，从中就能看见它采用了会社的形式，或者是被当地人称作“会社游行”的形式。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott, though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the ceremony. Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the members being solely women. In men's clubs such celebrations were, though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives, had denuded such women's clubs as remained (if any other did) of this their glory and consummation. The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the local Cerealia. It had walked for hundreds of years, if not as benefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对马洛特村稍为年轻的居民来说，会社游行是一件使他们感兴趣的事件，尽管参加游行的人看不出它的真正趣味。它的特点主要不在于它保留了每年排队游行和跳舞的古风，而在于参加游行的人全是妇女。在男子会社里，这类庆祝虽然逐渐消失，但还不算特别；但是，由于软弱女子天性羞涩和男性家属方面的讥笑态度，已经把残留下来的妇女会社（如果还有其它会社的话）的荣耀和隆盛剥夺干净了。现在只有马洛特村的妇女会社残存下来，保留着庆祝赛丽斯节①的古风。它已经延续了好几白年，如果算不上共济会，它也是一种供奉上帝的姐妹会；而且它还要继续存在下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest. The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from a curious legend of King Henry III's reign, in which the killing by a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had run down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine. In those days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was densely wooded. Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon its slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so many of its pastures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这块地方不仅地形引人入胜，它的历史也很有趣。在从前的时代里，这个谷被叫作白鹿苑。名字来自国王亨利三世治下的一段离奇传说。据说国王追上了一只美丽的白鹿后把它放了，却被一个名叫托玛斯·德·拉·林的人把白鹿杀了，因此他被国王处罚了一大笔罚金。在那个时代，一直到比较近些的时代，这个地方到处都长着茂密的森林。即使到了现在，从山坡上残存下来的古老的橡树林和错落不齐的树林带上，从为牧场遮荫的许多空心树上，都找得到当年情形的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train, their silver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and trouble, having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance in such a jaunty situation. In a true view, perhaps, there was more to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom the years were drawing nigh when she should say, 'I have no pleasure in them', than of her juvenile comrades. But let the elder be passed over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在游行的队伍里，有几个已到中年甚至还要年老的妇女，她们遭到时光的蚀刻和痛苦的磨难，银白的鬈发和满是皱纹的面孔在轻快活泼的环境里，显得叫人好笑，也肯定叫人同情。真实地看来，每一个经历过人间沧桑的人同她们年轻的伙伴比起来，也许更值得搜集她们的材料加以叙述，因为她们要说“生命毫无喜悦”的年月就要来到了。不过还是让我们把年长的妇女放在一边，述说那些生命在胸衣下跳动得快速而热烈的妇女吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand, and in her left a bunch of white flowers. The peeling of the former, and the selection of the latter, had been an operation of personal care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了白色的长袍醒目而外，每一个妇女和姑娘的右手，都拿着一根剥去了外皮的柳树枝条，左手里则拿着一束白色的鲜花。剥去柳枝的外皮，选择白色的鲜花，都是每个人自己细心操作的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns -- a gay survival from Old Style days, when cheerfulness and May-time were synonyms -- days before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous average. Their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional march of two and two round the parish. Ideal and real clashed slightly as the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and creeper-laced house-fronts; for, though the whole troop wore white garments, no two whites were among them. Some approached pure blanching; some were all had a bluish pallor; some worn by the older characters (which had possibly lain by folded for many a year) inclined to a cadaverous tint, and to a Georgian style.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="队伍中的妇女们都身穿白色长袍——这是一种从罗马旧历时代就开始流行的欢乐遗风，那时候快乐和五月的时光是同义词——那个还没有习惯着眼未来的时代，已经把人的感情降低到了单调乏味的程度。他们最初的表演是排成双行队伍绕着教区游行。太阳照亮了她们的身形，在绿色的树篱和爬满藤萝的房屋前墙的映衬下，理想和现实就稍微显出一些冲突来；因为尽管整个游行的队伍都穿着白色服装，然而她们中间却没有两件的颜色是一样的。有些近乎纯白；有些却是泛蓝的浅白；还有一些已经被妇女会的老会员穿得破旧（它们有可能叠起来存放许多年了）而接近了一种灰白的颜色，式样还是乔治时代的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold, and black, and brown. Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were genuine country girls, un-accustomed to many eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻的姑娘们的确在游行的队伍中占了大多数，她们头上厚实的秀发在阳光的照耀下，反射出每一种金黄、乌黑和棕褐的颜色。有的姑娘眼睛漂亮，有的姑娘鼻子好看，有的姑娘嘴巴美观和身材秀美，但是如果说有人能够集众美于一身，那也没有几个人。由于在众目睽睽之下抛头露面，很明显她们对如何安排她们的嘴唇就感到困难了，对如何摆放她们的脑袋，如何使她们的自我意识同她们的形体分开，她们也感到无能为力。这表明她们都是素朴的乡村姑娘，还不习惯被许多眼睛注视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which, though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will. Thus they were all cheerful, and many of them merry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她们每一个人的胸膛里，她们都有自己的小太阳照耀着灵魂，所以大家身上都暖烘烘的，不过不是被太阳晒热的；有些梦想，有些纯情，有些偏爱，至少有些遥远而渺茫的希望，虽然也许正在化为泡影，却仍然还在不断地滋长，因为希望是会不断滋长的。所以，她们每个人都精神振奋，许多人都欢欣鼓舞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation. She was a fine and handsome girl -- not handsomer than some others, possibly -- but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape. She wore a red ribbon in her hair, and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment. As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above her elbows. This was the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times. Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his head, and singing in a slow recitative --</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience. The dialect was on her tongue to some extent, despite the village school: the characteristic intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing approximately rendered by the syllable UR, probably as rich an utterance as any to be found in human speech. The pouted-up deep red mouth to which this syllable was native had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape, and her lower lip had a way of thrusting the middle of her top one upward, when they closed together after a word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝·德北菲尔德在她人生的这个时候，满腔的纯情还没有带上人生的经验。尽管进过乡村小学，但在她的说话里还是带有某种程度的乡音：因为这个地区的方言的特殊音调，大约就体现在音节UR的发声上，也许同任何可以发现的人类说话的言语一样丰富。要念这个本地的音节，苔丝得把她深红的嘴巴撅起来，但是又刚好没有把形状固定下来，她的下嘴唇在上嘴唇的中部有点儿撮起，念完一个字后，她才把嘴巴闭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

As she walked along to-day, for all her bouncing handsome womanliness, you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling from her eyes; and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now and then. Yet few knew, and still fewer considered this. A small minority, mainly strangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and grow momentarily fascinated by her freshness, and wonder if they would ever see her again: but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque country girl, and no more.</div>

The eldest wore the white tie, high waistcoat, and thin-brimmed hat of the regulation curate; the second was the normal undergraduate; the appearance of the third and youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him; there was an uncribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire, implying that he had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groove. That he was a desultory tentative student of something and everything might only have been predicted of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The young man, thus invited, glanced them over, and attempted some discrimination; but, as the group were all so new to him, he could not very well exercise it. He took almost the first that came to hand, which was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor did it happen to be Tess Durbeyfield. Pedigree, ancestral skeletons, monumental record, the d'Urberville lineaments, did not help Tess in her life's battle as yet, even to the extent of attracting to her a dancing-partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry. So much for Norman blood unaided by Victorian lucre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年青人这样受到邀请，就把她们打量了一阵，想作一番鉴别；但是，他见这一群姑娘全是新面孔，就感到不能很好地应用他的鉴别力了。他挑选的几乎就是第一个走到他跟前的女孩子，而不是希望被他挑中的那个说话的姑娘。苔丝·德北菲尔德碰巧也没有被挑中。高贵的门第，祖先的枯骨，纪功的铭文，德北菲尔家族的容貌，在苔丝人生的搏斗中到目前为止还没有为她帮上忙，就是在一群最普通的乡村女孩子中间，也没有帮她吸引到一个陪她跳舞的舞伴。没有维多利亚财富支持的诺曼人的血统，原来也不过如此。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The name of the eclipsing girl, whatever it was, has not been handed down; but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury of a masculine partner that evening. Yet such was the force of example that the village young men, who had not hastened to enter the gate while no intruder was in the way, now dropped in quickly, and soon the couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked extent, till at length the plainest woman in the club was no longer compelled to foot it on the masculine side of the figure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何，那个独占鳌头的姑娘的名字并没有流传下来；但是她在那天傍晚却因为第一个得到拥有男舞伴的殊荣而受到大家的羡慕。不过榜样自有它的力量，在外人还没有进入舞场的时候，乡村的男青年并不急着进去，现在很快都进了舞场，不久，大多数成对的女孩子中就掺进来乡村小伙子，最后连相貌最平常的妇女也有男子陪着她们跳舞了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The church clock struck, when suddenly the student said that he must leave -- he had been forgetting himself -- he had to join his companions. As he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield, whose own large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect of reproach that he had not chosen her. He, tool was sorry then that, owing to her backwardness, he had not observed her; and with that in his mind he left the pasture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教堂的钟声敲响了，那个学生突然说他必须离开了——他刚才一直得意忘形——他不得不去追赶他的同伴。在他从跳舞中退出来时，眼睛看见了苔丝·德北菲尔德，老实说，因为先前没有选中她，她的一双大眼睛里含有微微的怨恨。此时，由于她的退缩不前，他也为自己没有注意到她而感到遗憾；他心里就带着这种遗憾离开了牧场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All of them, except, perhaps, one. This white shape stood apart by the hedge alone. From her position he knew it to be the pretty maiden with whom he had not danced. Trifling as the matter was, he yet instinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight. He wished that he had asked her; he wished that he had inquired her name. She was so modest, so expressive, she had looked so soft in her thin white gown that he felt he had acted stupidly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们所有的人都把他忘了，也许有一个姑娘除外。那个白色的身影离开了舞场，独自一人站在树篱旁边。他从她站的地点上可以看出来，她就是那个他没有同她跳舞的漂亮姑娘。虽然只不过是一件微不足道的小事，但是他本能地感觉到，她已经因为被他忽视而遭到了伤害。他真希望他邀请过她；他也真希望曾经问过她的名字。她是那样的羞怯，那样的富有情感，她穿着那件薄薄的白色袍子，看上去是那样的温柔，他感到他刚才没有挑选她是太愚蠢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On account of his long delay he started in a flying-run down the lane westward, and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise. He had not yet overtaken his brothers, but he paused to get breath, and looked back. He could see the white figures of the girls in the green enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among them. They seemed to have quite forgotten him already.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为他已经耽搁很久了，他就开始在通向西边的小路上飞跑起来，很快就跑过了一片洼地，到了前面的山坡上。他还没有追上他的两个哥哥，但是他得停下来喘一口气，又回头看看。他能够看见姑娘们的白色身影在绿色的舞场上旋转着，就像刚才他在她们中间一起旋转一样。她们似乎已经完全把他忘记了。">查看中文翻译</div>
