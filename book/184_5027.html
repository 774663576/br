<div class="line_en">While he said these words there was a noise like a soft explosion and immediately a cold light, grey with a little blue in it, flooded the cavern. All hope that the speaker had been idly boasting when he spoke of his hundred armed followers died at once. Jill found herself blinking and staring at a dense crowd. They were of all sizes, from little gnomes barely a foot high to stately figures taller than men. All carried three-pronged spears in their hands, and all were dreadfully pale, and all stood as still as statues. Apart from that, they were very different; some had tails and others not, some wore great beards and others had very round, smooth faces, big as pumpkins. There were long, pointed noses, and long, soft noses like small trunks, and great blobby noses. Several had single horns in the middle of their foreheads. But in one respect they were all alike: every face in the whole hundred was as sad as a face could be. They were so sad that, after the first glance, Jill almost forgot to be afraid of them. She felt she would like to cheer them up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说这些话的时候，有个声音像是轻柔的爆炸声，大岩洞里顿时有一片冷光，灰沉沉中带点蓝幽幽的光。大家都希望那个一直在瞎吹牛，提到有一百个武装的随从的人马上死掉。吉尔却不知不觉对着密密麻麻一群人眨眨眼睛，还盯着他们看。这些人个子高矮不一，有不到一英尺高的小精灵，也有比常人高的威武的大个子。手里全都拿着三叉长矛，个个都苍白得要命，全都一动不动站着，活像雕像。除此之外，他们就大不相同了；有的有尾巴，有的没有，有的留着大胡子，另外的人脸蛋圆滚滚，光溜溜，像只大南瓜。有的是长长的尖鼻子，有的是软绵绵的长鼻子，像小象鼻似的，还有胖乎乎肉疙瘩似的大鼻子。还有几个前额正中长了只独角。但有一点他们却很相像：在这百来张脸上每张都有无比伤心的神情。他们是那么伤心，吉尔看了一眼后，几乎忘了害怕他们。她感到她很想让他们高兴起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well!" said Puddleglum, rubbing his hands. "This is just what I needed. If these chaps don't teach me to take a serious view of life, I don't know what will. Look at that fellow with the walrus moustache -- or that one with the --"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“起来。”地下人的头头说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was nothing else to be done. The three travellers scrambled to their feet and joined hands. One wanted the touch of a friend's hand at a moment like that. And the Earthmen came all round them, padding on large, soft feet, on which some had ten toes, some twelve, and others none.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没办法，他们三个只好赶紧站起来，手拉着手。一个人在这种时候就需要摸着一个朋友的手。那些地下人全都围在他们身边，一双双又大又软的脚慢慢走着，有的长着十个脚趾，有的长着十二个，另外一些一个也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cold light came from a large ball on the top of a long pole, and the tallest of the gnomes carried this at the head of the procession. By its cheerless rays they could see that they were in a natural cavern; the walls and roof were knobbed, twisted, and gashed into a thousand fantastic shapes, and the stony floor sloped downward as they proceeded. It was worse for Jill than for the others, because she hated dark, underground places. And when, as they went on, the cave got lower and narrower, and when, at last, the light-bearer stood aside, and the gnomes, one by one, stooped down (all except the very smallest ones) and stepped into a little dark crack and disappeared, she felt she could bear it no longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那团冷光是从一根长杆顶上的一个大球里发出来的。一个最高的小精灵举着这根长杆，走在队伍前面。在惨淡的光线下，他们看得出自己正在一个天然的大岩洞里；洞壁和洞顶都疙疙瘩瘩，歪歪扭扭，裂成千奇百怪的形状。他们走的石头地往下倾斜。这对吉尔比对别人更糟，因为她最讨厌黑暗的地下场所。他们走下去时，那山洞变得越来越低，越来越窄，最后拿灯的那个站在一边，小精灵一个一个弯下腰（只有最小的几个不用弯腰），踏进一条又小又黑的裂缝里就不见了，她觉得自己再也受不了啦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Comfortable!" said Jill. But she got down and they crawled in on their elbows. It was a nasty place. You had to go flat on your face for what seemed like half an hour, though it may really have been only five minutes. It was hot. Jill felt she was being smothered. But at last a dim light showed ahead, the tunnel grew wider and higher, and they came out, hot, dirty, and shaken, into a cave so large that it scarcely seemed like a cave at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“舒服”吉尔说。不过她还是跪下了，他们都用手拐儿撑着爬了进去。洞里是个让人恶心的地方，你得趴在地上，似乎爬上半小时光景，其实可能只有五分钟。里面很热，吉尔觉得自己要闷死了。不过前面终于露出一点朦胧的光，地道也变得更宽更高了。他们走出来时又热又脏，浑身发抖，来到一个山洞里，这山洞很大，简直完全不像一个山洞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here they passed dozens of strange animals lying on the turf, either dead or asleep, Jill could not tell which. These were mostly of a dragonish or bat-like sort; Puddleglum did not know what any of them were.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was full of a dim, drowsy radiance, so that here they had no need of the Earthmen's strange lantern. The floor was soft with some kind of moss and out of this grew many strange shapes, branched and tall like trees, but flabby like mushrooms. They stood too far apart to make a forest; it was more like a park. The light (a greenish grey) seemed to come both from them and from the moss, and it was not strong enough to reach the roof of the cave, which must have been a long way overhead. Across the mild, soft, sleepy place they were now made to march. It was very sad, but with a quiet sort of sadness like soft music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞里充满朦朦胧胧、昏昏沉沉的光，因此他们不需要地下人那奇怪的灯笼了。地上软软的，长着一种青苔，青苔上长着好多奇形怪状、分枝的、像树那么高像蘑菇那么松软的东西。这些东西离得太远，形不成树林，倒更像个公园。那种光（一种绿灰色的光）似乎就是从这些东西和青苔上发出来的，不过还不够亮，照不到洞顶，想必离头顶还有一大段距离吧。穿过这个不冷不热，令人困倦的柔软地方，他们被迫往前走。这真叫人非常伤心，只是像柔和的音乐那样，伤心中又带点恬静的味儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do they grow here?" Scrubb asked the Warden. He seemed very surprised at being spoken to, but replied, "No. They are all beasts that have found their way down by chasms and caves, out of Overland into the Deep Realm. Many come down, and few return to the sunlit lands. It is said that they will all wake at the end of the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们都是生长在这儿的吗？”斯克罗布问那个看守。他对有人对他说话似乎十分惊讶，但回答说，“不，它们全是。从裂缝和山洞钻下来的动物，从上面的世界钻到幽深王国。下来的多，回到阳光下的大地上去的少。据说到了世界末日，它们才会醒过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they had walked for several miles, they came to a wall of rock, and in it a low archway leading into another cavern. It was not, however, so bad as the last entrance and Jill could go through it without bending her head. It brought them into a smaller cave, long and narrow, about the shape and size of a cathedral. And here, filling almost the whole length of it, lay an enormous man fast asleep. He was far bigger than any of the giants, and his face was not like a giant's, but noble and beautiful. His breast rose and fell gently under the snowy beard which covered him to the waist. A pure, silver light (no one saw where it came from) rested upon him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们这样走了好几英里，来到一堵石墙面前，墙上有一道低低的拱门，通往另一个山洞。不过这个拱门不像上次那个入口那么糟，吉尔走过去时不用低头。走过拱门，他们就进入一个小一点的山洞，又长又窄，形状大小就像个大教堂。有一个其大无比的人躺在那儿呼呼大睡，从山洞这头到那头几乎都给他身子塞满了。他个子比任何巨人都大得多，而脸却不像巨人，显得高贵而美丽。胸脯在垂到腰部的雪白胡子下轻轻起伏。一股纯银色的光照在他身上（谁也没看见这光是哪儿来的）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who's that?" asked Puddleglum. And it was so long since anyone had spoken, that Jill wondered how he had the nerve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是谁？”普德格伦问。隔了那么久没人说话，吉尔真想知道它怎么有那股勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His mouth shut like a box when he had said this, and in the great silence of that cave the children felt that they would not dare to speak again. The bare feet of the gnomes, padding on the deep moss, made no sound. There was no wind, there were no birds, there was no sound of water. There was no sound of breathing from the strange beasts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说了这些话以后，他的嘴就紧紧闭上，在山洞的一片寂静中，两个孩子觉得自己也不敢再说话了。小精灵的一双双光脚走在深深的青苔上，一点声音也没有。没有风，没有鸟，没有水声。那些奇怪的动物连呼吸的声音也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And out of that cave they passed into another, and then into another and another, and so on till Jill lost count, but always they were going downhill and each cave was lower than the last, till the very thought of the weight and depth of earth above you was suffocating. At last they came to a place where the Warden commanded his cheerless lantern to be lit again. Then they passed into a cave so wide and dark that they could see nothing of it except that right in front of them a strip of pale sand ran down into still water. And there, beside a little jetty, lay a ship without mast or sail but with many oars. They were made to go on board her and led forward to the bows where there was a clear space in front of the rowers' benches and a seat running round inside the bulwarks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出了那个山洞，他们又经过另一个山洞，接着再走进一个又一个，走啊走的，走得吉尔都数不清走过几个山洞了，但他们一直是在下山，每个山洞都比前一个低，你一想起上面的土地有多重有多深就不由憋住气。最后他们来到一个地方，看守命令再点上那只惨淡的灯笼。于是他们走进了一个又宽又黑的山洞，里面什么都看不见，只见一股灰白的沙子正泻入静止的水面。在一个小小的码头旁边，停着一条船，没有梳杆也没有帆，只有很多桨。他们被赶上船，带到船头，在划船手的长凳前面，有一块空间，沿舷墙内侧还装着一排座位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is old Father Time, who once was a King in Overland," said the Warden. "And now he has sunk down into the Deep Realm and lies dreaming of all the things that are done in the upper world. Many sink down, and few return to the sunlit lands. They say he will wake at the end of the world."</div>

They had thought him a wet blanket while they were still above ground, but down here he seemed the only comforting thing they had. Then the pale lantern was hung up amidships, the Earthmen sat to the oars, and the ship began to move. The lantern cast its light only a very short way. Looking ahead, they could see nothing but smooth, dark water, fading into absolute blackness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently they were given food -- flat, flabby cakes of some sort which had hardly any taste. And after that, they gradually fell asleep. But when they woke, everything was just the same; the gnomes still rowing, the ship still gliding on, still dead blackness ahead. How often they woke and slept and ate and slept again, none of them could ever remember. And the worst thing about it was that you began to feel as if you had always lived on that ship, in that darkness, and to wonder whether sun and blue skies and wind and birds had not been only a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，他们分到了一点食物——种又淡又松，几乎吃不出什么味道的饼。此后他们就慢慢睡着了。但等他们醒来时，一切还是一样，小精灵依然在划桨，船依然在悄悄前进，前面依然是一团漆黑。他们醒了又睡，吃了又睡有多少次，大家都记不得了。最糟糕的就是你开始觉得自己似乎一直生活在这艘船上，生活在那片黑暗中，心里闹不清什么太阳、蓝天、风和鸟，到底是否只是一场梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last their ship was brought alongside a quay and made fast. The three travellers were taken ashore and marched up into the City. Crowds of Earthmen, no two alike, rubbed shoulders with them in the crowded streets, and the sad light fell on many sad and grotesque faces. But no one showed any interest in the strangers. Every gnome seemed to be as busy as it was sad, though Jill never found what they were so busy about. But the endless moving, shoving, hurrying, and the soft pad-pad-pad went on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他们这条船给拖到码头边拴牢。他们三个被带上岸，走进城去。成群的地下人，面貌各不相同，在拥挤的街头跟他们擦肩而过，暗淡的光照在许许多多悲哀、古怪的脸上。但没人对陌生人表现出一点兴趣。每个小精灵似乎都是又忙碌又悲哀，虽然吉尔根本看不出他们那么忙忙碌碌在干什么。只是没完没了的走啊走、推推搡搡，匆匆忙忙，轻轻的脚步声叭嗒叭嗒响个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was a queer city. The lights were so few and far apart that they would hardly have done for scattered cottages in our world. But the little bits of the place which you could see by the lights were like glimpses of a great seaport. You could make out in one place a whole crowd of ships loading or unloading; in another, bales of stuff and warehouses; in a third, walls and pillars that suggested great palaces or temples; and always, wherever the light fell, endless crowds -- hundreds of Earthmen, jostling one another as they padded softly about their business in narrow streets, broad squares, or up great flights of steps. Their continued movement made a sort of soft, murmuring noise as the ship drew nearer and nearer; but there was not a song or a shout or a bell or the rattle of a wheel anywhere. The City was as quiet, and nearly as dark, as the inside of an ant-hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这是座奇怪的城市。灯光那么少，距离又那么远，在我们的世界里还比不上分散的农舍呢。但从灯光下你看得见的这一小块地方很像是一个大海港。你看得出有一个地方有好多船正在装卸货物；另一个地方，有一包包货物和一个个仓库，第三个地方，有墙和柱子，使人想起大宫殿或庙宇；而且，无论哪儿有灯，总有没完没了的人群——成千上万的地下人，一个个挨挨挤挤，在狭窄的街道上，宽阔的广场上，或者在巨大的石阶上，轻轻走动，忙着自己的事儿。船越来越近，他们不停的动作形成一种轻轻的沙沙声，但到处都听不到歌声、吆喝声或是钟声，或是车轮声。这个城市是静悄悄的，而且几乎像一座蚁山内部那么漆黑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last they came to what appeared to be a great castle, though few of the windows in it were lighted. Here they were taken in and made to cross a courtyard, and to climb many staircases. This brought them in the end to a great murkily lit room. But in one corner of it -- oh joy! -- there was an archway filled with a quite different sort of light; the honest, yellowish, warm light of such a lamp as humans use. What showed by this light inside the archway was the foot of a staircase which wound upward between walls of stone. The light seemed to come from the top. Two Earthmen stood one on each side of the arch like sentries, or footmen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mullugutherum shook his head, motioned to the travellers to follow and began going up the staircase. At every step the light increased. There were rich tapestries hanging on the walls. The lamplight shone golden through thin curtains at the staircase-head. The Earthmen parted the curtains and stood aside. The three passed in. They were in a beautiful room, richly tapestried, with a bright fire on a clean hearth, and red wine and cut glass sparkling on the table. A young man with fair hair rose to greet them. He was handsome and looked both bold and kind, though there was something about his face that didn't seem quite right. He was dressed in black and altogether looked a little bit like Hamlet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穆鲁古瑟伦摇摇头，对这三个做做手势，让他们跟着开始上楼。每上一级楼梯，灯光就更亮。墙上挂着富丽的挂毯。在楼梯头有薄薄的帘子透出的金色灯光。地下人拉开帘子，站在一边。他们三个就走了进去。那是一间十分漂亮的房间，挂满了挂毯，干净的壁炉里炉光明亮，桌上的刻花玻璃杯和红酒闪闪发光。一个年轻的金发男人起身向他们问好。他长得一表人材，看上去为人勇敢又和气，然而脸上似乎有一种不大对头的神情。他全身都穿黑，看上去有点像哈姆莱特。">查看中文翻译</div>

She is a nosegay of all virtues, as truth, mercy, constancy, gentleness, courage, and the rest. I say what I know.

<div class="line_en">"Rilian? Narnia?" he said carelessly. "Narnia? What land is that? I have never heard the name. It must be a thousand leagues from those parts of the Overworld that I know. But it was a strange fantasy that brought you seeking this -- how do you call him? -- Billian? Trillian? in my Lady's realm. Indeed, to my certain knowledge, there is no such man here." He laughed very loudly at this, and Jill thought to herself, "I wonder is that what's wrong with his face? Is he a bit silly?"</div>
