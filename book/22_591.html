<div class="line_en">Until then, however, I didn't trouble myself to wonder; for I still supposed I should get out. Even when a week went by, and then another, I supposed it. I only understood at last that I must give up my idea that Dr Christie would be the man to release me -- for if he believed that I was mad when I went in, then everything I said as time went on only seemed to serve to make him think me madder. Worse than that, he still held firm to his idea that I should be cured, and know myself again, if I might only be made to write.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have been put too much to literary work," he said on one of his visits, "and that is the cause of your complaint. But sometimes we doctors must work by paradoxical methods. I mean to put you to literary work again, to restore you. Look here." He had brought me something, wrapped in paper. It was a slate and chalk. "You shall sit with this blank slate before you," he said, "and before this day is done, you shall have written me out -- neatly, mind! -- your name. Your true name, I mean. Tomorrow you shall write me the start of an account of your life; and you shall add to it, on each day that follows. You shall recover the use of your faculty of reason, as you recover your facility with the pen…"</div>

<div class="line_en">And so he made Nurse Bacon keep me sitting with the chalk in my hand, for hours at a stretch; and of course, I could write nothing, the chalk would crumble to a powder -- or else, grow damp and slippery from the sweating of my palm. Then he'd come back and see the empty slate, and frown and shake his head. He might have Nurse Spiller with him. "Ain't you wrote a word?" she'd say. "And here's the doctors spending all their time to make you well. Ungrateful, I call that."</div>

<div class="line_en">When he'd gone, she'd shake me. And when I'd cry and swear, she'd shake me harder. She could shake you so, you thought your teeth were being rattled out of your head. She could shake you until you were sick. -- "Got the grips," she'd tell the other nurses then, with a wink; and the nurses would laugh. They hated the ladies. They hated me. They thought that when I spoke in the way that was natural to me, I did it to tease them. I know they put it out that I got special attentions from Dr Christie, through pretending to be low. That made the ladies hate me, too. Only mad Miss Wilson was now and then kind to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wished he would go on pricking and scalding her for ever. The creosote had almost choked me. I was frightened of leeches. And his leaving me alone, it seemed to me, would give me more time for sitting and planning my escape in. For I still thought of nothing but of that. It got to June. I had gone in there some time in May. But I still had spirit enough to learn the lie of the house, to study the windows and doors, looking out for weak ones; and every time Nurse Bacon took out her chain of keys, I watched, and saw which did what. I saw that, as far as the locks on the bedroom and passage doors went, one key worked them all. If I could slip that key from a nurse's chain, I could make my escape, I was certain of it. But those chains were stout; and each nurse kept her keys very close; and Nurse Bacon -- who was warned I might be crafty -- kept hers closest of all. She gave them up only to Betty when she wanted something got out from her cupboard; and then she took them back at once, and dropped them into her pocket. I never saw her do it, without trembling in a hopeless rage.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed too hard that I -- of all people in the world! -- should be kept so low, so long, from everything that was mine, by a single key -- a single, simple key! not even a fancy key, but a plain one, with four straight cuts upon it that, given the right kind of blank and file, I knew I should have been able, in half a moment, to fake up. I thought it, a hundred times a day. I thought it as I washed my face, and as I took my dinner. I thought it as I walked the little garden; as I sat in the drawingroom, hearing ladies mumble and weep; as I lay in my bed, with the nurse's lamp blazing in my eyes. If thoughts were hammers or picks I should have been free, ten thousand times over. But my thoughts were more like poisons. I had so many, they made me sick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这太难办了，就因为一把钥匙——一把普通的小钥匙，我——还有全世界的人！——就得被他们关押着，如此卑贱，如此漫长，远离属于我的一切。也不是什么了不得的钥匙，只是一把普通钥匙，上面有四条凹槽，给我合适的钥匙坯和锉刀，我知道我就能够，不消眨眼的工夫，配出来一把。我盘算着此事，一天要想几百遍。洗脸的时候想，吃饭的时候想。在小花园里放风的时候想，坐在客厅里，听着病人们嘟囔、哭叫闹，我也在想。躺在床上，护士的灯光刺着我眼，我还在想。如果想法是榔头和锄头的话，那我早就自由了，我都逃了几万次了。然而，我的反复盘算却更像是毒药。我的想法太多了，多到令我生了毛病。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a dull sort of sickness, not like the sharp panic that had gripped me and made me sweat, in my first days there. It was a kind of creeping misery, that crept so slow, and was so much a part of the habits of the house -- like the colour of the walls, the smell of the dinners, the sound of weeping and shrieks -- I did not know it had gained upon me, until too late. I still said, to everyone who spoke to me, that I was quite in my right mind -- that I was there, through a mistake -- that I was not Maud Rivers, and must be let out at once. But I said it so often, the words grew soft -- like coins losing their faces through being too much spent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一种难以察觉的毛病。它并不像我最初到这儿的时候，那种突如其来地攫住我的身心，让我冒冷汗的恐惧。那是一种慢慢潜入我体内的痛苦，如此缓慢，已成为这座医院的固定节目——就好象墙壁的颜色，午饭的味道，哭声和尖叫声。我也没感觉到这毛病正折磨着我，等我知道了，也晚了。我还在别人说我头脑正常，跟每一个同我说话的人说——我是给弄错了，才进来的——我不是莫德。瑞富斯太太，必须立即放我出去云云。可是我说的太唠叨了，慢慢地，那些话变得无比顺溜——就好象硬币用多了，表面就磨光了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day at last, I walked with a lady in the garden and said it again; and the lady looked at me in pity. "I thought the same thing, once," she said kindly.

I put my hands to my eyes. The gown was blue, I was certain of it. Why, I had been wearing it when they got me into the madhouse! They had taken it from me -- and they had taken, too, Maud's mother's bag, and all the things that were in it -- the brushes and combs, the linen, the red prunella slippers -- I never saw those again. Instead -- I looked down at myself, at the tartan dress and rubber boots. I had grown almost used to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked, as the lady had said, like a lunatic. My hair was still sewn to my head, but had grown or worked loose from its stitches, and stood out in tufts. My face was white but marked, here and there, with spots and scratches and fading bruises. My eyes were swollen -- from want of sleep, I suppose -- and red at the rims. My face was sharper than ever, my neck like a stick. The tartan gown hung on me like a laundry bag. From beneath its collar there showed the dirty white tips of the fingers of Maud's old glove, that I still wore next to my heart. You could just make out, on the kid-skin, the marks of my teeth.</div>

The nurse who had been set to watch us was sitting with her eyes closed, dozing in the sun, but a little to the left of her was the window that looked into the drawing-room.

<div class="line_en">I looked, for perhaps a minute. I looked, and thought of all the times that Mrs Sucksby had washed and combed and shined my hair, when I was a girl. I thought of her warming her bed before she put me in it, so I should not take chills. I thought of her putting aside, for me, the tenderest morsels of meat; and smoothing my teeth, when they cut; and passing her hands across my arms and legs, to be sure that they grew straight.

She was worse than Nurse Flew -- not heavier, but more awkward, for she lay with the points of her limbs, her knees and her elbows and her hips, pressing hard into mine; and her corset was a stiff one, with edges that seemed to cut me like a saw. Her hair had an oil upon it and smelt sour, and her breath was loud, like thunder, in my ear. "Come on, you little bitch," she said to me, "sing out!" -- but I had some pride, even then.

<div class="line_en">That week was a terrible one. I had got my own mind back, the house seemed crueller than ever, and I saw how far I had sunk before in growing used to it. Say I grew used to it again, in seven days? Say I grew stupid? Say Charles came back, and I was too funked to know him? The thought nearly killed me. I did everything I could to keep myself from slipping into a dream again. I pinched my own arms, until they were black with bruises. I bit my own tongue.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there was the fear that, after all, Charles wouldn't come -- that I had been too mad -- that he would lose his nerve, or be overtaken by disaster. I thought of all the likely and unlikely things that might keep him from me -- such as, his being seized by gipsies or thieves; run down by bulls; falling in with honest people, who would persuade him to go back home. One night it rained, and I thought of the ditch he was sleeping in filling up with water and him being drowned.

No-one called out that night, no-one had awful dreams, no bells were rung, everyone lay heavy in their beds. I was the only wakeful soul in the house -- the only wakeful soul, I might as well have been, in all the world; except, that I knew that Charles was also wakeful -- was waiting, on the other side of Dr Christie's walls -- was waiting for me; and that, beyond him, Mrs Sucksby was also waiting -- perhaps, was sighing in her bed -- or walking, wringing her hands and calling out my name… It must have been the thought of that, that gave me courage and made the file run true.</div>

"Dear God, I swear, I'll be good, I'll be honest the rest of my days, I swear -- " It caught, and stuck. "Fuck! Fuck!" I said. The wards had jammed, I had not cut true after all: now it would not turn, either forwards or backwards. " Fuck! You fuckster! Oh!" I gripped it harder, and tried again -- still nothing -- at last I let it go. I went silently back to my bed, got Nurse Bacon's ointment jar, stole back with it to the door, put grease across the key-hole and blew it into the lock. Then, almost fainting with fear, I gripped the key again; and this time -- this time, it worked.</div>

<div class="line_en">The key was finished. I held it, in a sort of daze. My fingers were stained from the iron, and grazed from the slipping of the file, and almost numb from gripping. I dared not stay to bind them up, though. Very carefully I rose, pulled on my tartan gown, and took up my rubber boots. I also took Nurse Bacon's comb. -- That was all, just that. I lifted it from off her table, and, as I did, she moved her head: I held my breath, but she did not wake. I stood quite still, looking into her face. And I was filled, suddenly, with guilt. I thought, "How disappointed she'll be, when she finds how I've tricked her!" -- I thought of how pleased she had got, when I'd said I would rub her hands.</div>

The voice called, softly, "Hey!" -- I heard it, and almost died. I thought it was calling me. Then there came a woman's laugh, and I saw figures: two men -- Mr Bates, I think, and another; and a nurse -- Nurse Flew, with the swivel-eye. "You'll get your -- " one of them said; but that was all I heard. They went through bushes, at the side of the house. Nurse Flew laughed again. Then the laugh got stifled, and there came silence. I did not wait to see what the silence would become. I ran -- lightly, at first, across the strip of gravel -- then fast and hard, across the lawn. I didn't look back at the house. I didn't think about the ladies, still inside it. I should like to say I went and threw my key into the little walled garden, for one of them to find; but I did not. I didn't save anyone but myself.

It had been months and months since I had stood on any kind of path and had to choose the way to take. I looked about me, and the land and the lightening sky seemed suddenly vast and fearful.

We should have been glad of a lift, but I was afraid, each time, that the cart or coach might have been sent out after us, from the madhouse. Only when we saw an old farmer driving out of a gate in a donkey-cart, did I think we could be sure he was not one of Dr Christie's men: we put ourselves in his way, and he slowed the donkey and let us ride beside him for an hour. I had combed out the plaits and stitches from my hair and it stood up like coir, and I had no hat, so put a handkerchief of Charles's about my head.

<div class="line_cn" title="我说话的时候，一直飞快地看着四周，看着其他农舍的窗子，还有小路上；不过没人过来。那个小姑娘把钱放进围裙口袋，抱起她的小弟弟，歪歪扭扭地走了；我看她走了，便飞一般地奔进屋子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I meant Maud. I was thinking of the little girl, Janet, coming back to the cottage with the flour and her bag of sweets, I was thinking of her mother, coming home in time for tea, and finding her wedding-gown gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that was just the thing, I supposed, for the country. We left the fields and the shady paths and went back to the road; and after a time another old farmer came by, and he drove us another few miles; and then we walked again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过那都只是，我觉得，乡下的事。我们离开了田野和幽暗的小路，走回到大路上；过了一阵，又有一位老农经过，他搭我们走了几里路；然后我们又步行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't look at me, you infant!" I said. "Oh! Oh!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要看我，你这个傻小子！”我说道。“噢！噢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Damn her!" I got hold of Maud's glove, and ripped it till the stitches gave. Then I threw it to the ground and jumped on it. Charles watched, with a look of terror on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她这个该死的！”我抓着莫德的手套，撕扯着，撕到线头也露出来了。然后我把它扔到地上，跳上去又踩又跺。查尔斯在一旁看着，一脸惊惶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then I grew frightened of someone coming. I took the glove up again and put it back next to my bosom, and tied up the strings of the bonnet. I threw my madhouse gown and my rubber boots into a ditch. The blisters on my feet had opened, and were weeping like eyes; but the stockings were thick ones, and the black shoes were worn and soft. The dress had a pattern of roses on it, and the bonnet had daisies at the brim. I imagined how I must look -- like a picture, I thought, of a milkmaid on a dairy wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是随后，我便害怕有人过来。我又捡起手套，将它放回我心口处，再系好帽子上的绳子。我把我疯人院的衣裳和胶鞋都扔到水沟里。我脚上的水泡都破了，象眼睛一样冒着水；可是那双袜子，那是双厚袜子。那双黑鞋已经破了，倒是柔软合脚。那件衣裳上有玫瑰的图样，帽子边儿上缀着雏菊。我想象着我得是个什么样子——像一副画，我觉得，贴在奶牛场墙壁上的，画中是一个挤奶女工。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We still walked hard. Charles was silent all the way. Finally he broke out with: "You took them shoes and that gown, without asking."</div>

<div class="line_en">We spent the night in the hay of an open barn, and he lay with his back to me, his shoulder-blades shaking. I wondered if he might run off to Briar while I slept; and I waited until he grew quiet, then tied the laces of one his boots to the laces of one of mine, so I should wake up if he tried to. He was an aggravating boy; but I knew I should do better with him than without him, just now -- for Dr Christie's men would be looking for a girl on her own, not a girl and her brother. I thought that if I had to, I would give him the slip once we reached London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在一个敞开的谷仓的干草堆里过夜，他躺着，背对我，肩胛骨颤动着。我想知道，趁我睡着了，他是不是会跑掉，跑回布莱尔；我就等着，一直等到他变安静了，便把他一只靴子的鞋带跟我的一根鞋带系在一起，这样一来，他要是想跑，我就会醒过来了。他是个总要让人大发脾气的人；不过我明白，眼下有他总比没他好——因为克里斯蒂医生的人会寻找一个孤身只影的姑娘，而不是一个姑娘和她的兄弟。我想，如果我非得这么做，到了伦敦，我就让他溜掉算了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I said we would send the woman her clothes back, and buy her a brand-new pie, in London. Charles looked doubtful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说我们会把这个女人的衣裳送还给她，还要在伦敦给她买一块新鲜出炉的馅饼。查尔斯有些怀疑地看着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But London still seemed far off. The air still smelled too pure. Some time in the night I woke, and the barn was full of cows: they stood in a circle and looked us over, and one of them coughed like a man. Don't tell me that's natural. I woke up Charles, and he was as frightened as I was. He got up and tried to run -- of course, he fell down, and nearly took my foot off. I undid our laces. We went backwards out of the barn, then ran, then walked. We saw the sun rise over a hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是伦敦依旧遥不可及。空气的味道依旧清凉新鲜。有的时候，我夜里醒来，谷仓里都是奶牛：它们站成一圈儿，打量着我们，其中一奶头牛象人一样咳嗽起来。可别跟我说那是自然现象。我叫醒查尔斯，结果他跟我一样惊恐万分。他站起来想跑路——当然了，他摔倒了，差点把我的脚拽掉了。我解开我们俩的鞋带。我们一步步后退，退出了谷仓，然后撒腿就跑，跑一阵又走。我们看到太阳升起来了，升到一座小山包上面了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The night had been cold as winter, but the hill was a steep one and we grew warm as we climbed. When we got to the top, the sun was higher in the sky and the day was lightening up. I thought, The morning has broken. -- I thought of the morning like an egg, that had split with a crack and was spreading.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜里冷得冬天，不过那个小山包挺陡峭，我们爬山，爬着爬着就暖和了。当我们爬到山顶时，太阳高挂在天空中，天已经大亮了。我心想，早晨破壳而出啦。——我想早晨就像个鸡蛋，有一道裂缝，它就会裂开，喷出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before us lay all the green country of England, with its rivers and its roads and its hedges, its churches, its chimneys, its rising threads of smoke. The chimneys grew taller, the roads and rivers wider, the threads of smoke more thick, the farther off the country spread; until at last, at the farthest point of all, they made a smudge, a stain, a darkness -- a darkness, like the darkness of the coal in a fire -- a darkness that was broken, here and there, where the sun caught panes of glass and the golden tips of domes and steeples, with glittering points of light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们眼前，英格兰的绿色大地铺展开来，展示着它的一条条河流，它的一条条道路，它的一排排篱笆，它的一座座教堂，它的一根根烟囱，和它袅袅升起的烟雾。烟囱越来越高，道路和河流越来越宽阔，烟雾越来越浓重，大地向远方延伸过去。一直延伸到最后，延伸到最远的那一点，汇聚成一团浓烟，一块黑斑，一片幽暗——一片幽暗，就好象火中之炭的幽暗——一片幽暗，被星星点点的光刺破了，那是太阳照到窗格玻璃的反光，还有圆屋顶和尖屋顶的金色的尖儿上，那隐约闪烁的光。">查看中文翻译</div>
