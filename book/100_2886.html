<div class="line_cn" title="她嗤之以鼻，“大概吧，我琢磨着，只要你付得起费用……那为何不干脆说‘我要度假两年’？不是一回事儿吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Forty?" He too seemed to be struggling with the concept. "Don't know. Am I allowed to say 'rich'?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“四十？”对这个字眼他似乎也颇感陌生，努力想象着，“不知道。我可不可以说要做个‘富人’。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh I think you're probably a bit too broad-minded as it is," she said, turning her face away, for the moment at least. They settled again on the pillow. "Anyway, I didn't mean what are you doing next month, I meant the future-future, when you're, I don't know…" She paused, as if conjuring up some fantastical idea, like a fifth dimension. "… Forty or something. What do you want to be when you're forty?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我认为你现在恐怕是心胸太宽了些。”她说着扭头避开—至少在那一刻。他们再次躺下。“我不是问你下个月要去做什么，我是问将来，等到你，让我想想……”她顿了顿，似乎在凭空幻想着什么，比如第五维空间。“四十岁，你四十岁的时候希望成为什么样的人？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Exciting!" He was imitating her voice now, her soft Yorkshire accent, trying to make her sound daft. She got this a lot, posh boys doing funny voices, as if there was something unusual and quaint about an accent, and not for the first time she felt a reassuring shiver of dislike for him. She shrugged herself away until her back was pressed against the cool of the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“振奋！”他开始模仿她说话，故意让那柔软的约克郡口音显得又痴又笨。这一套她见得多了：时髦少年故作滑稽地学人说话，似乎方言口音是什么稀奇古怪的东西。她又一次对他心生厌恶，身子向后一缩，背脊直贴到凉丝丝的墙上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dexter Mayhew. She peered up at him through her fringe as he leant against the cheap buttoned vinyl headboard and even without her spectacles on it was clear why he might want to stay exactly this way. Eyes closed, the cigarette glued languidly to his lower lip, the dawn light warming the side of his face through the red filter of the curtains, he had the knack of looking perpetually posed for a photograph. Emma Morley thought "handsome" a silly, nineteenth-century word, but there really was no other word for it, except perhaps "beautiful". He had one of those faces where you were aware of the bones beneath the skin, as if even his bare skull would be attractive. A fine nose, slightly shiny with grease, and dark skin beneath the eyes that looked almost bruised, a badge of honour from all the smoking and late nights spent deliberately losing at strip poker with girls from Bedales. There was something feline about him: eyebrows fine, mouth pouty in a self-conscious way, lips a shade too dark and full, but dry and chapped now, and rouged with Bulgarian red wine. Gratifyingly his hair was terrible, short at the back and sides, but with an awful little quiff at the front. Whatever gel he used had worn off, and now the quiff looked pert and fluffy, like a silly little hat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯特·梅休。她透过自己刘海的缝隙窥视着他，只见他脑袋向后一靠，倚上了廉价的塑料床头板；不戴眼镜她都能瞧出来他多么乐于维持现状—闭着眼睛，嘴里松松叼着的烟贴着下唇，一侧脸颊被隔着红窗帘透进来的淡淡晨曦抹上一层暖色。他熟谙摆姿势的要领，似乎随时都能供人拍摄。爱玛·莫利一向认为“英俊”是十九世纪的无聊词语，然而若要形容他，又实在找不出更贴切的词了，再不然，或许可以称他为“俊美”吧—面颊的轮廓能让人感觉出皮下的骨架，似乎单那副头骨就叫人羡爱。精致的鼻子上皮脂泛着微光，眼眶下的皮肤颜色暗沉，像是有淤伤，其实是抽烟熬夜打牌又故意输给女生的荣誉标志。他的模样带着些猫科动物的特征：眉毛浓密，双唇饱满、不自然地撅着，唇色暗淡，干涩而皲裂，又因保加利亚红酒留下的痕迹而殷红点点。令人窃喜的是，那发型很不像样：后面和两侧剃得很短，额前却蓄着难看的一小绺—看不出用了何种发胶，总之早就失效，因而这一绺蓬松而突兀，像顶滑稽的帽子。">查看中文翻译</div>

"You're in this sports car with the roof down in Kensington or Chelsea or one of those places and the amazing thing about this car is it's silent, "cause all the cars'll be silent in, I don't know, what -- 2006?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”她挪动身子，将羽绒被夹在腋下，“你开着一辆敞篷跑车，行驶在肯辛顿的公路上，也可能是切尔西之类的地方，惊人的是跑车没有噪音，因为到那时所有的汽车都是静音的了，那已经是……我想想，哦，二○○六年了吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still with his eyes closed, he exhaled smoke through his nose. Clearly he knew he was being looked at because he tucked one hand beneath his armpit, bunching up his pectorals and biceps. Where did the muscles come from? Certainly not sporting activity, unless you counted skinny-dipping and playing pool. Probably it was just the kind of good health that was passed down in the family, along with the stocks and shares and the good furniture. Handsome then, or beautiful even, with his paisley boxer shorts pulled down to his hip bones and somehow here in her single bed in her tiny rented room at the end of four years of college. "Handsome"! Who do you think you are, Jane Eyre? Grow up. Be sensible. Don't get carried away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他依旧闭着双眼，鼻孔里喷出烟雾。他显然知道自己正被盯着看，因为他刻意把一只手掖在另一侧腋窝下，隆起了胸肌和肱二头肌。这肌肉是怎么来的？显然不是运动练就的，除非把裸体泡浴和打台球也算作锻炼。这副好身板大约同股票证券和名贵家具一样，也承袭自他的家族。就是这样一位英俊，甚至俊美的主儿，在她四年大学时光结束之际，不知怎的就来到了她租住的小屋，躺在了她的单人床上，涡纹图案的拳击短裤还低低地扯到髋骨上。英俊！她寻思着，算了，你以为自己是谁啊，简·爱？老大不小了，清醒点儿，别被他弄得神魂颠倒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He exhaled through his nose and shuffled up the bed, taking in the shabby rented room, knowing with absolute confidence that somewhere in amongst the art postcards and photocopied posters for angry plays there would be a photograph of Nelson Mandela, like some dreamy ideal boyfriend. In his last four years he had seen any number of bedrooms like this, dotted round the city like crime scenes, rooms where you were never more than six feet from a Nina Simone album, and though he'd rarely seen the same bedroom twice, it was all too familiar. The burnt out nightlights and desolate pot plants, the smell of washing powder on cheap, ill-fitting sheets. She had that arty girl's passion for photomontage too; flash-lit snaps of college friends and family jumbled in amongst the Chagalls and Vermeers and Kandinskys, the Che Guevaras and Woody Allens and Samuel Becketts. Nothing here was neutral, everything displayed an allegiance or a point of view. The room was a manifesto, and with a sigh Dexter recognised her as one of those girls who used "bourgeois" as a term of abuse. He could understand why "fascist" might have negative connotations, but he liked the word "bourgeois" and all that it implied. Security, travel, nice food, good manners, ambition; what was he meant to be apologising for?</div>

He should probably get out of here as soon as possible, and he glanced at his discarded clothes in preparation for his escape. From the bathroom came the warning rattle and bang of an ancient toilet cistern, and he hurriedly replaced the book, finding beneath the bed a small yellow Colman's mustard tin that he flipped open to confirm that, yes, it did contain condoms, along with the small grey remains of a joint, like a mouse dropping.

Here she was, after four romantically barren years, finally, finally in bed with someone she really liked, had liked since she'd first seen him at a party in 1984, and in just a few hours he'd be gone. Forever probably. He was hardly likely to ask her to go to China with him, and besides she was boycotting China. And he was alright, wasn't he? Dexter Mayhew. In truth she suspected he wasn't all that bright, and a little too pleased with himself, but he was popular and funny and -- no point fighting it -- very handsome. So why was she being so stroppy and sarcastic? Why couldn't she just be self-confident and fun, like those scrubbed, bouncy girls he usually hung around with? She saw the dawn light at the tiny bathroom window. Sobriety.

She'd be overweight and disappointed and would complain about him sneaking off without saying goodbye. Best to leave quietly, and no reunions. Move on, look to the future. Plenty more faces out there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他此刻离去，怕是再也见不到这张脸庞了，除非十年后的同学会上或许能骇然相逢。到时候她应该已经发福，满腹牢骚，还要抱怨他的不告而别。最好悄悄离去，并且别再重逢。走吧，放眼未来。外面还有众多新的脸庞等着你。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Never mind that, back to her face. There was a slight greasy sheen on the tip of her small, neat nose and a spattering of tiny red spots on her forehead, but these aside there was no denying that her face -- well, her face was a wonder. With her eyes closed he found that he couldn't recall their exact colour, only that they were large and bright and humorous, like the two creases in the corners of her wide mouth, deep parentheses that deepened when she smiled, which seemed to be often. Smooth, pink mottled cheeks, pillows of flesh that looked as if they would be warm to the touch. No lipstick but soft, raspberry-coloured lips that she kept tightly closed when she smiled as if she didn't want to show her teeth, which were a little large for her mouth, the front tooth slightly chipped, all of this giving the impression that she was holding something back, laughter or a clever remark or a fantastic secret joke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="别琢磨这些了，继续说她的脸蛋吧。小巧周正的鼻尖上有小小一抹油脂泛着光泽，前额上散布着一片红色小斑点。不过这些对她的面庞毫无影响。哦，她的脸生得太美了。此刻她合着眼，他竟记不起她瞳孔的颜色，只知道很明媚，透着丝丝笑意；一如她嘴角的皱痕，如同一对深凹的圆括号，笑起来变得更深。而她常常微笑。面颊的皮肤光洁，散布着粉色的斑点，脸蛋肉嘟嘟地鼓着，摸上去该是热乎乎的。没有涂唇膏的双唇很柔软，透着紫浆果色，笑起来也是抿着的，似乎不想露出牙齿，因为与嘴形相比，那牙齿显得稍大了些，还不太整齐。而所有这些都让人觉得她似乎在隐藏着什么：一阵大笑、一句俏皮话，或者一个妙绝而隐晦的笑话。">查看中文翻译</div>
