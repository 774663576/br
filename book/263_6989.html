<div class="line_en">I had half the biscuits for supper. and tried to keep warm in the heather. I was feeling quite pleased. So far I had been very lucky. The milkman, the man at the hotel, Sir Harry, the roadman and even Marmaduke had all helped me, and I felt that with help like this I might win. My main problem now was that I was very hungry. I fell asleep imagining the most beautiful meals.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我进了一间很不错的屋子，屋子里摆满了书。中间放着一张书桌，桌旁坐着一位老人，神态慈祥。鼻尖上架着一副眼镜，头顶秃秃的像玻璃一样闪着光。他一动不动，抬着头等着我开口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't know where I was, but I knew I must keep moving. I was twenty minutes in front of them, but they were local men and they knew these hills better than I did. Soon they were close behind me and I was running as fast as I could. After a time I saw to my left some trees and the chimneys of a farmhouse. I ran down towards them and found myself in a garden. As I came nearer the house, I saw an old man looking at me through an open door. I crossed the garden and went in.</div>
