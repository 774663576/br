<div class="line_en">As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进入十一月后，天气变得非常寒冷。学校周围的大山上灰蒙蒙的，覆盖着冰雪，湖面像淬火钢一样又冷又硬。每天早晨，地面都有霜冻。从楼上的窗口可以看见海格，他全身裹在长长的鼹鼠皮大衣里，戴着兔毛皮手套，穿着巨大的海狸毛皮靴子，在魁地奇球场上给飞天扫帚除霜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎没有人看见过哈利打魁地奇，因为伍德决定对哈利参赛的事严加保密，要把他作为他们队的一个秘密武器。但是哈利要担当找球手的消息还是泄漏了出去。结果，有人对他说他会打得很棒，也有人对他说他们到时候要举着床垫。在下面跟着他跑，防止他摔下来——哈利不知道哪种说法更糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利得知，魁地奇比赛有七百种犯规的办法，而它们都出现在一四七三年的一场世界杯比赛中；找球手通常是个头最小速度最快的选手，最严重的魁地奇事故似乎都发生在他们身上；尽管魁地奇比赛时很少有人死亡，但据说裁判经常消失得无影无踪，几个月后才出现在撒哈拉沙漠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏自从哈利和罗恩把她从庞大的巨怪手里救出来以后，她对于违反校规便不那么在意了，这就使她变得可爱多了。哈利第一次参加魁地奇比赛的前一天，他们三人趁课间休息的时候来到外面寒冷的院子里。她已经用魔法为他们变出了一捧明亮的蓝色火焰，可以放在一只果酱罐里随身携带。他们站在那里，背对着火焰取暖。这时，斯内普从院子里穿过。哈利一眼就注意到斯内普走路一瘸一拐的。哈利、罗恩和赫敏靠得更拢一些，想挡住火焰，不让别人看见；他们知道这肯定是不被允许的。不幸的是，他们脸上那种心虚的表情吸引了斯内普的视线。他一瘸一拐地走过来。他没有看见火焰，但他似乎在寻找一个理由，不管怎么说都要训他们一顿。">查看中文翻译</div>
