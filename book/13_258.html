<div class="line_en">Gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of Shadowfax were lost in the night, when Merry came back to Aragorn. He had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at Parth Galen, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of Isengard. Hasufel was already saddled. Legolas and Gimli with their horse stood close by.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So four of the Company still remain," said Aragorn. "We will ride on together. But we shall not go alone, as I thought. The king is now determined to set out at once. Since the coming of the winged shadow, he desires to return to the hills under cover of night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“远征队还剩下四名成员，”亚拉冈说：“我们一起出发吧！我本来以为只会有我们四人，但看来不会是这样了，骠骑王已经决定立刻离开此地。在那飞行的黑影出现之后，他希望藉着夜色的掩护赶回山中。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I cannot say yet," Aragorn answered. "As for the king, he will go to the muster that he commanded at Edoras, four nights from now. And there, I think, he will hear tidings of war, and the Riders of Rohan will go down to Minas Tirith. But for myself, and any that will go with me…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我现在还不确定，”亚拉冈回答：“至于骠骑王的部分，他准备在四天之后在伊多拉斯集结所有的部队。在那里，我想他会先研判有关这场战争的情报，然后带着骠骑军团前往米那斯提力斯，除了我和愿意与我同行的人例外。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with Gimli behind Legolas, and Merry in front of Aragorn. Presently they were riding swiftly through the night. They had not long passed the mounds at the Fords of Isen, when a Rider galloped up from the rear of their line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快的，所有人都已经做好了出发的准备，金雳坐在勒苟拉斯之后，梅里则坐在亚拉冈之前，他们把握夜色飞快赶路。不久之后，一行人就越过了艾辛河渡口的山丘，一名骑士从后面赶了上来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't leave me behind!" said Merry. "I have not been of much use yet; but I don't want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over. I don't think the Riders will want to be bothered with me now. Though, of course, the king did say that I was to sit by him when he came to his house and tell him all about the Shire."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别把我丢下来！”梅里说：“我一直没派上什么用场，但我也不想被抛在一边，像是行李一样到结束的时候才被想起来。我不认为骠骑们还会花时间照顾我，但国王的确说过，当我们到达他的皇宫时，我要在他身边告诉他夏尔的状况。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Aragorn, "and your road lies with him, I think, Merry. But do not look for mirth at the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere Théoden sits at ease again in Meduseld. Many hopes will wither in this bitter Spring."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”亚拉冈说，“梅里，我认为你该待在他身边，但是，不要预期会有快乐的结局，我担心希优顿王可能要很久之后才能够安心重回他的王宫。在这萧瑟的春天里，恐怕会有很多希望跟着消逝。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Théoden at once called a halt. The Riders turned about and seized their spears. Aragorn dismounted and set Merry on the ground, and drawing his sword he stood by the king's stirrup. Éomer and his esquire rode back to the rear. Merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do. Supposing the king's small escort was trapped and overcome, but he escaped into the darkness -- alone in the wild fields of Rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles? "No good!" he thought. He drew his sword and tightened his belt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希优顿立刻下令全军停止，骠骑们调转马头，擎起长枪。亚拉冈跳下马，把梅里抱下来，同时间拔出宝剑，在骠骑王身边站定，伊欧墨和他的贴身护卫也从队伍前头赶回来。梅里这时更觉得自己是丝毫派不上用场的行李，如果真的开打了，他也不知道自己该做些什么；万一骠骑王单薄的兵力被包围、击败，就算他孤身一人逃入黑暗中，在一望无际的洛汗原野中，他根本不知该如何是好。“这样不行！”他想。他决定拔出宝剑，把腰带勒紧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My lord," he said to the king, "there are horsemen behind us. As we crossed the fords I thought that I heard them. Now we are sure. They are overtaking us, riding hard."</div>

<div class="line_en">When they were some fifty paces off, Éomer cried in a loud voice: "Halt! Halt! Who rides in Rohan?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it rode out clear again. Then they all heard the sound of hoofs, and at the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords. The moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears. The number of the pursuers could not be told, but they seemed no fewer than the king's escort, at the least.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西沉的月亮渐渐被云雾遮掩，但突然间又穿透遮蔽，射出万丈银光。然后，他们都听见了马蹄的声音，同时也可以看见黑暗的身影从渡口的方向急驰而来。月光反射在枪尖上，流露出一股肃杀气氛；追兵的人数难以判定，但他们看起来并不比骠骑王的卫队少。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand. A silence followed; and then in the moonlight, a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forward. His hand showed white as he held it up, palm outward, in token of peace; but the king's men gripped their weapons. At ten paces the man stopped. He was tall, a dark standing shadow. Then his clear voice rang out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="追兵们以高超的马术让马匹煞住冲势，接着是一阵让人喘不过气的沉寂；然后，在月光下，众人看见一名骑士跳下马，缓缓走向前。他对着众人露出掌心，这是和平的手势，但骠骑王的手下仍然禁不住抓紧了武器。到了十步之外，那人停了下来，他十分的高大，全身都包围在阴影中。然后，他清澈的声音响起：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你们找到了，”伊欧墨说：“在你们越过渡口之后就进了我们的国境，这是骠骑王希优顿的国度。未经他同意，无人可以在骠骑国中奔驰。你是谁？为什么这么仓促？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Merry breathed a sigh of relief. He had thought that this was some last trick of Saruman's, to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in Théoden's defence, not yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里松了一口气，他本来以为这是萨鲁曼的最后伏兵，趁骠骑王身边兵力薄弱的时候偷袭他。幸好，看来他这次不用为了保卫希优顿而牺牲了，至少暂时是如此，他将宝剑收回剑鞘中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you have found him also!" cried Aragorn. Giving his reins to Merry, he ran forward and embraced the newcomer. "Halbarad!" he said. "Of all joys this is the least expected!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，我没有召集你们啊，”亚拉冈说：“或许我在心中想过，我经常想到你们的处境，今夜更是如此。来吧！这些事情都先放到一边去。我们正冒着绝大的危险赶路，如果骠骑王同意，你们可以加入我们一起走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All is well," said Aragorn, turning back. "Here are some of my own kin from the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and how many they be, Halbarad shall tell us."</div>

<div class="line_en">And Aragorn said to Halbarad: "What is that that you bear, kinsman?" For he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff, as it were a standard, but it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many thongs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，亚拉冈对贺尔巴拉说：“兄弟，你带的那是什么东西？”他注意到对方没有携带长枪，反而背着一根长棍，似乎是根旗杆，但长棍的尾端却又用黑布包裹，以绳子紧密缠起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我替瑞文戴尔之星辰准备给你的礼物，”贺尔巴拉回答道：“她花了很多时间秘密编织了这东西。她同时也请我带几句口信给你：‘末日将临。如果我们的希望之火熄灭，一切都将陷入黑暗。我将这亲手为你做的东西送给你，再会了，精灵宝石！’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在堡顶的房间里，”勒苟拉斯说：“我想他可能没吃也没睡。他大概三小时之前离开，说他必须好好思考一下，只有他的同胞贺尔巴拉和他一起去，看得出来他似乎心事重重。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But even as Aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence," said Legolas. "And have you marked the brethren Elladan and Elrohir?

<div class="line_en">For a while the three companions walked together, speaking of this and that turn of the battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood on Helm's Dike and looked into the Coomb. The Death Down already stood there, black and tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the grass by the Huorns could be plainly seen. The Dunlendings and many men of the garrison of the Burg were at work on the Dike or in the fields and about the battered walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary valley resting after a great storm. Soon they turned back and went to the midday meal in the hall of the Burg.</div>

They were clad in cloaks of dark grey, and their hoods were cast now over helm and head. Their horses were strong and of proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood there without a rider, Aragorn's own horse that they had brought from the North; Roheryn was his name. There was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness; nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star.</div>

It would be a great company; for the king was leaving only a small garrison in the Burg, and all who could be spared were riding to the weapontake at Edoras. A thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night; but still there would be some five hundred more to go with the king, for the most part men from the fields and dales of Westfold.</div>

Presently Éomer came out from the gate, and with him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old. So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. Behind them walked Legolas and Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for Aragorn, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head.

<div class="line_en">So time unreckoned passed, until Gimli saw a sight that he was ever afterwards loth to recall. The road was wide, as far as he could judge, but now the Company came suddenly into a great empty space, and there were no longer any walls upon either side.

<div class="line_en">Nonetheless he drew near, and saw Aragorn kneeling, while Elladan held aloft both torches. Before him were the bones of a mighty man. He had been clad in mail, and still his harness lay there whole; for the cavern's air was as dry as dust, and his hauberk was gilded. His belt was of gold and garnets, and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor. He had fallen near the far wall of the cave, as now could be seen, and before him stood a stony door closed fast: his finger-bones were still clawing at the cracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he had hewn at the rock in his last despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使如此，他还是越走越近，看见亚拉冈跪在那边，伊莱丹则是拿着两支火把替他照明，在他眼前是一名勇士的骸骨。他原先似乎穿着练甲，骨架也完好无缺，多半是因为这座洞穴十分的干燥，而它的练甲也没有破损；它的黄金腰带上镶着拓榴石，趴在地上的头骨上戴着黄金打造的头盔。现在众人才发现，他倒在洞壁之前，尸体前方正好是一扇紧闭的石门，白森森的指骨依旧抓着门缝。一柄断折破碎的宝剑丢在一旁，彷佛他绝望中用尽最后一丝力气来敲打这扇门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aragorn did not touch him, but after gazing silently for a while he rose and sighed. "Hither shall the flowers of simbelmynë come never unto world's end," he murmured.

<div class="line_en">Suddenly he heard the tinkle of water, a sound hard and clear as a stone falling into a dream of dark shadow. Light grew, and lo! the Company passed through another gateway, high-arched and broad, and a rill ran out beside them; and beyond, going steeply down, was a road between sheer cliffs, knife-edged against the sky far above. So deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky was dark, and in it small stars glinted. Yet as Gimli after learned it was still two hours ere sunset of the day on which they had set out from Dunharrow; though for all that he could then tell it might have been twilight in some later year, or in some other world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，他听见水滴落下的声响，那如同岩石落进黑暗阴影中一样清楚的声音，四周逐渐变亮，终于！众人穿越另一扇拱门，一条小河在他们身旁奔流着。在拱门之外是一条夹在陡峭山崖间的向下斜坡，山崖如同锐利的刀尖一样直入云霄。这一线天的景象让底下的众人勉强看见天空是黑暗的，上面有许多的星斗闪耀。不过，稍后金雳才知道，这还是他们从登哈洛出发那天，距离日落还有两小时。不过，对他来说，这似乎是置身另一个世界、另一个年代的黄昏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before; and then a chill blast came in which the torches flickered and went out, and could not be rekindled. Of the time that followed, one hour or many, Gimli remembered little. The others pressed on, but he was ever hindmost, pursued by a groping horror that seemed always just about to seize him; and a rumour came after him like the shadow-sound of many feet. He stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast on the ground and felt that he could endure no more: he must either find an ending and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear.</div>

None of the people of the valley dared to approach it, nor would they dwell near; for they said that it was a trysting-place of the Shadow-men and there they would gather in times of fear, thronging round the Stone and whispering.</div>
