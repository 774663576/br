<div class="line_en">Next day Philip began work again, but the end which he expected within a few weeks did not come. The weeks passed into months. The winter wore away, and in the parks the trees burst into bud and into leaf. A terrible lassitude settled upon Philip. Time was passing, though it went with such heavy feet, and he thought that his youth was going and soon he would have lost it and nothing would have been accomplished. His work seemed more aimless now that there was the certainty of his leaving it. He became skilful in the designing of costumes, and though he had no inventive faculty acquired quickness in the adaptation of French fashions to the English market. Sometimes he was not displeased with his drawings, but they always bungled them in the execution. He was amused to notice that he suffered from a lively irritation when his ideas were not adequately carried out. He had to walk warily. Whenever he suggested something original Mr. Sampson turned it down: their customers did not want anything outre, it was a very respectable class of business, and when you had a connection of that sort it wasn't worth while taking liberties with it. Once or twice he spoke sharply to Philip; he thought the young man was getting a bit above himself, because Philip's ideas did not always coincide with his own.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip longed to give him a punch on the nose, but he restrained himself. After all it could not possibly last much longer, and then he would he done with all these people for ever. Sometimes in comic desperation he cried out that his uncle must be made of iron. What a constitution! The ills he suffered from would have killed any decent person twelve months before. When at last the news came that the Vicar was dying Philip, who had been thinking of other things, was taken by surprise. It was in July, and in another fortnight he was to have gone for his holiday. He received a letter from Mrs. Foster to say the doctor did not give Mr. Carey many days to live, and if Philip wished to see him again he must come at once. Philip went to the buyer and told him he wanted to leave. Mr. Sampson was a decent fellow, and when he knew the circumstances made no difficulties. Philip said good-bye to the people in his department; the reason of his leaving had spread among them in an exaggerated form, and they thought he had come into a fortune. Mrs. Hodges had tears in her eyes when she shook hands with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Foster said that the Vicar must not talk, it would tire him; she treated him like a child, with kindly despotism; and there was something childish in the old man's satisfaction at having cheated all their expectations. It struck him at once that Philip had been sent for, and he was amused that he had been brought on a fool's errand. If he could only avoid another of his heart attacks he would get well enough in a week or two; and he had had the attacks several times before; he always felt as if he were going to die, but he never did. They all talked of his constitution, but they none of them knew how strong it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">For several days Mr. Carey continued without change. His appetite which had been excellent left him, and he could eat little. Dr. Wigram did not hesitate now to still the pain of the neuritis which tormented him; and that, with the constant shaking of his palsied limbs, was gradually exhausting him. His mind remained clear. Philip and Mrs. Foster nursed him between them. She was so tired by the many months during which she had been attentive to all his wants that Philip insisted on sitting up with the patient so that she might have her night's rest. He passed the long hours in an arm-chair so that he should not sleep soundly, and read by the light of shaded candles The Thousand and One Nights. He had not read them since he was a little boy, and they brought back his childhood to him. Sometimes he sat and listened to the silence of the night. When the effects of the opiate wore off Mr. Carey grew restless and kept him constantly busy.</div>

The old man was fighting with the fear of death. And Philip thought that all must go through that. Oh, how monstrous it was, and they could believe in a God that allowed his creatures to suffer such a cruel torture!

It gave him a peculiar emotion. Presently Mrs. Foster came out to him and said that his uncle wished to see him. The curate was putting his things back into the black bag. The sick man turned his head a little and greeted him with a smile.

He had taken the body and blood of his Savior, and they had given him strength so that he no longer feared the inevitable passage into the night. He knew he was going to die: he was resigned. He only said one thing more:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普没做声。他能看出伯伯的一脸真诚，这简直像是奇迹。他从救世主那里获得血肉皮囊，也正是这些给他力量，让他步入那逃避不开的漆黑暗夜。他知道自己将要死去：而他依然安之若素。只留下最后一句话：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It startled Philip. He remembered with what a callous selfishness his uncle had treated her, how obtuse he had been to her humble, devoted love. The curate, deeply moved, went away and Mrs. Foster, weeping, accompanied him to the door. Mr. Carey, exhausted by his effort, fell into a light doze, and Philip sat down by the bed and waited for the end. The morning wore on, and the old man's breathing grew stertorous. The doctor came and said he was dying. He was unconscious and he pecked feebly at the sheets; he was restless and he cried out. Dr. Wigram gave him a hypodermic injection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普惊呆了。他想起伯伯曾经的铁石心肠、自私自利，对妻子卑微、深沉的爱意麻木不屑。副牧师也深受感动，默默退出房间。福斯特夫人则哭哭啼啼地把他送到门口。凯利先生经过刚才一番折腾早就筋疲力竭，浅浅地睡了过去。菲利普坐在床边，等着最后一刻的来临。一个上午就这样过去了，伯伯的呼吸声越来越重，渐渐变成鼾声。医生来看过后，说他很快就要走了。他已经没了意识，轻轻咬着被角，不时抽搐一下，发出痛苦的呻吟。威格拉姆医生给他打了一针。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip hesitated. It occurred to him that it would seem brutal to fetch a woman to wash the body while his uncle still lived, and he wondered why Mrs. Foster had asked him to come. They would think he was in a great hurry to kill the old man off. He thought the undertaker looked at him oddly. He repeated the question. It irritated Philip. It was no business of his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普犹豫了。他忽然想到，在伯伯还活着的时候就请人来擦洗身子未免显得太残忍，不知道福斯特夫人怎么会建议他这样做。别人肯定会觉得他巴不得早点折腾死自己的伯伯呢。菲利普觉得葬礼承办人看自己的眼神很古怪，他又把问题重复了一遍。菲利普气不打一处来：这关他什么事？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She went down to get herself something to eat, and Philip watched curiously the process of death. There was nothing human now in the unconscious being that struggled feebly. Sometimes a muttered ejaculation issued from the loose mouth. The sun beat down hotly from a cloudless sky, but the trees in the garden were pleasant and cool. It was a lovely day. A bluebottle buzzed against the windowpane. Suddenly there was a loud rattle, it made Philip start, it was horribly frightening; a movement passed through the limbs and the old man was dead. The machine had run down. The bluebottle buzzed, buzzed noisily against the windowpane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说完便去厨房吃东西了。菲利普好奇地看着伯伯，想知道死亡究竟如何进行。眼前这个失去意识的人已经没有任何生气可言，松弛的嘴唇不时嘟囔着什么。炎热的太阳缓缓落下，天空澄净无云，园内树下投映出一片绿荫，看着仍旧宜人而凉爽。天气真心不错。一只绿头苍蝇嗡嗡撞在窗玻璃上。忽然，菲利普听到一阵可怕的咕噜声，惊讶地转头看着伯伯。只见他四肢猛地一抽，彻底告别了人世。这部机器终于停止了运转。绿头苍蝇还在一下一下撞着窗玻璃，嗡嗡、嗡嗡。">查看中文翻译</div>
