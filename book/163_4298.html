<div class="line_en">Once he was home, in order to escape this mood, Wang turned on the computer, put on the V-suit, and logged on to Three Body for the third time. The attempt to adjust his state of mind worked. By the time the log-in screen appeared, Wang seemed like a different person, one filled with an unexplainable excitement. Unlike the first two times, this time Wang came with a purpose: He was going to reveal the secret of the world of Three Body. He created a new log-in ID appropriate for his new role: Copernicus.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once logged in, Wang again stood on that broad, desolate plain, facing the strange dawn of the world of Three Body. A colossal pyramid appeared in the east, but right away Wang knew it was no longer the pyramid of King Zhou of Shang or Mozi. It had a Gothic-style apex, stabbing straight into the morning sky, recalling St. Joseph's Church at Wangfujing. But if that church were placed next to this pyramid, it would be nothing more than an entrance booth. He saw many buildings in the distance that were apparently dehydratories, but also now built in the Gothic style, with tall, sharp steeples, as though the ground had grown numerous spikes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several men were seated around the table. The dim light allowed Wang to see only the outlines of their faces. Their eyes were hidden in the shadows of their deep eye sockets, but Wang could still feel their gazes focusing on him. The men seemed to be dressed in medieval robes. On closer examination, one or two of them had simpler robes, more like Classical Greek chitons. At one end of the table was a thin, tall man. The golden crown on top of his head was the only thing that glittered in the Great Hall other than the candles. With some effort, Wang saw by the dim candlelight that his robe was different from the others': it was red.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌旁坐着几个人，昏暗的光线使汪淼仅能看清他们面庞的轮廓，他们的双眼都隐藏在深眼窝的阴影中看不到，但汪淼能感觉到聚集到他身上的目光。这些人似乎穿着中世纪的长袍，仔细看，还有一两个人的长袍更简洁一些，是古希腊式的。长桌的一头坐着一个瘦高的男子，他头上戴着的金冠是大殿中除蜡烛外唯一闪亮的东西，汪淼在蜡烛的光亮中很费力地看出，他身上的长袍与其他人不同，是红色的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wang saw a door on the side of the pyramid, lit from within by flickering lights. He walked over. Inside the tunnel was a row of statues of the gods of Olympus holding up torches, their surfaces blackened by smoke. He entered the Great Hall and saw that it was even dimmer than the entrance tunnel. Two silver candelabra on top of a long marble table provided a drowsy light.</div>

<div class="line_en">After calming himself and walking to the other end of the long table, Wang said, "It's actually pretty simple. The reason why the sun's motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns. Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable -- the three-body problem. When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that's a Stable Era. When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it's orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns. That's a Chaotic Era. After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins. This is a football game at the scale of the universe. The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汪淼走到长桌的另一端，让自己镇定了一下，说：“其实很简单：太阳的运行之所以没有规律，是因为我们的世界中有三颗太阳，它们在相互引力的作用下，做着无法预测的三体运动、当我们的行星围绕着其中的一颗太阳做稳定运行时，就是恒纪元；当另外一颗或两颗太阳运行到一定距离内，其引力会将行星从它围绕的太阳边夺走，使其在三颗太阳的引力范围内游移不定时，就是乱纪元；一段不确定的时间后，我们的行星再次被某一颗太阳捕获，暂时建立稳定的轨道，恒纪元就又开始了。这是一场宇宙橄榄球赛，运动员是三颗大阳，我们的世界就是球！”">查看中文翻译</div>

But we've never seen the sun behave that way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你缺乏起码的科学训练。”伽利略不以为然地摇摇头，“太阳是连续运行到远距离的，不可能跳跃过去，所以按你的假设，应该还有第三种情况：太阳比正常状态小，但比飞星大，它应该在运行中逐渐变成飞星大小，但我们从来没有看到过这样的太阳。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very true," said Wang. "But you apparently haven't discovered the special optical interaction between the sun's gaseous outer layer and our planet's atmosphere. It's a phenomenon akin to polarization or destructive interference. As a result, when we view the sun from within our atmosphere and it gets a certain distance from us, the gaseous outer layer suddenly becomes completely transparent and invisible, and all we can see is its bright inner core. The sun then appears to be only the size of the inner core, a flying star. This phenomenon has confused every researcher in every civilization throughout history, and prevented them from discovering the existence of the three suns. Now you understand why the appearance of three flying stars heralds a long period of extreme cold: because all three suns are far away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很对，但你显然没有发现太阳的气态外层与我们行星大气层间奇特的光学作用。这是一种类似于偏振的现象，使得在太阳超出一定的距离时，从我们的大气层里观察，大阳的气态外层突然变得透明不可见，只能看到它的发光内核，这时，太阳在我们的视野中就突然缩到内核大小，变成了飞星。正是这个现象，迷惑了历史上各个文明的研究者。使他们没有意识到三个太阳的存在。现在你们明白了，为什么三颗飞星的出现预示着漫长的严寒，因为这时三颗太阳都在远方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

But those who saw such a great sight could not leave behind any information about them because seeing three suns would mean that they had at most a few seconds left to live. They had no chance to escape or survive. Tri-solar days are the most terrifying catastrophes for our world. On such days, the surface of the planet would turn into a smelting furnace in a second, and the heat would be enough to melt rocks.

<div class="line_en">As he was about to light the firewood piled around Wang, a bright red light filled the entrance tunnel, followed by a wave of heat and smoke. A horse dashed out of the light and into the Great Hall. Its body was already on fire, and as it galloped, the wind whipped it into a ball of flames. The rider, a knight in heavy armor that glowed red from the heat, dragged a line of white smoke behind him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ground glowed red like a piece of iron in a blacksmith's furnace. Bright rivulets of lava snaked across the dim red earth, forming a net of fire that stretched to the horizon. Countless thin pillars of flame erupted toward the sky: The dehydratories were burning. The dehydrated bodies inside gave the fire a strange bluish glow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not far from him, Wang saw a dozen or so small pillars of flame of the same color. These were the people who had just run out of the pyramid: the pope, Galileo, Aristotle, and Leonardo. The fiery pillars around them were translucent blue, and he could see their faces and bodies slowly deforming in the flame. They focused their gazes on Wang, who had just emerged. Holding the same pose and lifting their arms toward the sky, they chanted in unison, "Tri-solar day --"</div>

<div class="line_en">Wang looked up and saw three gigantic suns slowly spinning around an invisible origin, like an immense three-bladed fan blowing a deadly wind toward the world below. The three suns took up almost the entire sky, and as they drifted toward the west, half of the formation sank below the horizon. The giant fan continued to spin, a bright blade occasionally shooting above the horizon to give the dying world another brief sunrise and sunset. After a sunset, the ground glowed dim red, and the sunrise a moment later flooded everything with its glaring, parallel rays.</div>
