<div class="line_en">In the Eastern ports where he worked for most of his life, Jim was very popular. He was an excellent seaman, who was liked and trusted by everyone. He was tall and strongly built, with a deep voice and a confident way of talking. To his employers and the ship captains, he was just Jim, nothing more. He had a special reason for not wanting people to know his other name. But nothing remains secret for long in sea ports, and soon someone who knew about his past was certain to arrive. When this happened, Jim always left his well-paid job immediately, and moved on to another port. Over several years he was known first in Bombay, then Calcutta, then Rangoon, Penang and Jakarta, as he moved towards the rising sun. Finally, when he could no longer bear this kind of life, he ran away from sea ports and white men for ever, hiding himself in the jungle, in a distant Malaysian village, far away from anyone who knew him. The natives of the village gave him an extra name. They called him Tuan Jim, or, as we would say, Lord Jim.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim had spent his childhood in a comfortable, peaceful home in the southwest of England. His father was a vicar, a kind man who always did his duty, and who had no doubts about what was right or wrong. The family house was warm and welcoming, with plenty of room for Jim and his four older brothers to play in. Close to it, on a hill, was the small grey church, standing, like a rock, where it had stood for centuries. There had been vicars in Jim's family for a hunderd years, but one of his brothers had already shown an interest in the Church, so his father had to find some other work for his youngest son. When Jim spent a whole summer reading sea stories, his father was delighted, and decided that Jim would join the merchant navy at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉姆的童年是在英格兰西南部一个舒适、祥和的家庭度过的。父亲是牧师，为人和善，总是尽职尽责，明辨是非。吉姆的家很温馨，足够他和四个哥哥尽情玩耍。旁边不远处是一座小山，山上有一座灰色的小教堂，它如同一块岩石，已经矗立了好几个世纪。一百年来，吉姆的家族中一直有人从事牧师职业，但他的一个哥哥已经表现出了对教会的兴趣，因此父亲得为小儿子找点儿别的事做。因为吉姆整个夏天都在读关于航海的故事，父亲高兴地决定立即让他加入商船队。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was sent to a training ship on a busy, wide river near London; there two hundred boys slept, ate and worked together, learning everything a sailor needs to know. Because he was strong, and quick, and intelligent, he learnt fast, and was generally liked. The work seemed easy to him, and he was confident of his bravery in any danger. Sometimes at night he used to forget the crowd of noisy boys around him, and escape into his own dream world of sea stories. He saw himself swimming bravely through the waves to save passengers from sinking ships, fighting natives on lonely islands, and giving orders to frightened sailors to save their lives. He was always the brave man who did his duty, just like the heroes in the stories that he had read at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉姆被送到一艘训练船上，训练船在伦敦附近一条忙碌、宽阔的河上。在那里，两百个年轻人同吃同睡，一起干活儿，学习水手需要知道的所有知识。吉姆强壮而聪敏，学东西快，而且大家都喜欢他。这些活儿对他来说似乎很轻松，他也坚信自己面对任何危险都能勇往直前。有时他会在夜里忘掉身边那一群吵闹的年轻人，独自沉溺在航海故事的梦幻中。他仿佛看见自己英勇地与海浪搏斗，从正在下沉的船只中救出乘客，在孤岛上与土人搏斗，命令被吓破了胆的水手自救。他是个勇敢而尽责的人，和他在家读的故事里的主人公一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Send the lifeboat out!" came the order. In the darkness two small ships had crashed into each other, and there were distant voices crying for help.

<div class="line_en">The lifeboat came dancing back through the waves, half full of water. The boys had saved two men, who now lay exhausted in the bottom of the boat. Jim no longer felt afraid of the sea. It seemed to him that he cared nothing for the storm. He would live through greater dangers than that, and would show the world how brave he was. That night he sat alone, while the boys who had saved the two men's lives told their excited friends the whole story. When they described the waves, and the cold, and the sinking ships, Jim felt angry. They were so proud of what they had done! He, too, had wanted to show his bravery. But perhaps it was better this way. He had learnt more from this experience than any of them. The next time a brave man was needed, he alone, he felt sure, would know how to fight the wind and the seas. And as the other boys talked and laughed together, Jim dreamed happily of the next adventure and his chance to prove himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="救生艇冲过惊涛骇浪颠簸着划了回来，灌了半船的水。小伙子们救回的两个人现在筋疲力尽地躺在救生艇里。吉姆不再害怕大海了。在他看来，他似乎对风暴已毫不在乎。他会度过比这更大的危险，向世界展示他的勇气。那一夜他独自坐着，听去救了人的小伙子们向兴奋的朋友们讲述整个经过。他们描述着海浪、寒冷和沉船；吉姆觉得很气愤，他们对自己做的事如此骄傲！吉姆也想展现他的勇敢，但现在的结果可能更好。他比其他任何人从这次经历中学到的都多。他相信，下一次需要勇者出手时，只有他知道如何与风浪和大海搏斗。其他年轻人在一起说笑着，而吉姆则幸福地想象着下一次历险，下一个证实自己的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After two years of training, he went to sea. He made many voyages on many different ships, but surprisingly there were no adventures. The sea had not yet tested him, or shown him the secret truth of his pretences. However, although he was still very young, he soon became chief mate of a fine ship. Unfortunately, he was badly hurt during a storm at sea, and when the ship reached an Eastern port, he was taken to hospital. His broken leg needed time to mend, and so he was left behind when his ship sailed away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两年的训练结束后，他当了水手。他在很多只船上作过多次航行，但奇怪的是一直没有什么历险。大海还没有考验他，没有揭示外表之下真实的他。虽然他年纪轻轻，却很快在一艘不错的船上当了大副。不幸的是，他在海上的一次暴风雨中受了重伤。船只驶达东方海港时，他被送到了医院。他骨折的腿需要时间恢复，所以船启航时，他被留了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Time passed slowly in the hospital, where the patients played cards, and slept, and told each other stories. There were brightly coloured flowers in the gardens, and warm, soft air blew in through the open windows. The hospital was on a hill, and had an excellent view of the port, which was always busy, as it was on one of the main sea routes to the East. Jim felt wonderfully calm as he looked out every day at the ships like toys in the sea, with the endless blue of the Eastern sky above, and the smiling peace of the Eastern seas all around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医院里的时间过得很慢。病人们玩牌，睡觉，彼此讲故事。花园里开着艳丽的花，和煦的轻风透过敞开的窗户吹进来。医院坐落在一座小山上，可以清楚地看到港口。因为处于通往东方的主航线上，这个港口总是很忙碌。每天，吉姆看着海面上玩具一样的船只，上面是东方无边无际的蓝色天空，四周弥漫着东方海域祥和、宁静的氛围。每到这时，吉姆就感到格外的平静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as he could walk, he left the hospital and started looking for a ship to take him back to England. While waiting, he naturally spent time with other European seamen in the port. Many of them had become lazy. They were used to the easy life of a white sailor in the East, and did not want to return to the bad weather, harder conditions and more dangerous duties of the West. They talked, not of work, but of luck, and chance, and money. At first, Jim refused to listen to them. But soon he began to find these men strangely interesting. How did they make a success of their lives, with so little work and so little danger? And suddenly, he decided not to go home to England, and took a job as chief mate of the Patna.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他刚能下床走路，就马上离开医院，想找一艘船带他回英格兰。在等船的时候，他自然同港口其他的欧洲海员待在一起。他们当中有许多人已经变得懒惰起来。他们习惯了白人海员在东方的安逸生活，不想回到气候恶劣、条件更艰苦、职责更危险的西方。他们谈论的不是工作，而是运气、机会和金钱。起初，吉姆不愿意听他们的谈话，但很快他开始发现这些人有趣得很。他们没干多少活儿，没有担多大的风险，但却很成功。他们是如何做到的呢？突然，他决定不回英格兰老家了，他做起了帕特纳号船的大副。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Patna was a local ship, as old as the hills, and in very bad condition.

He had arranged to take eight hundred pilgrims to the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim watched as the native people hurried on to the ship, filling every corner like water in a container. Eight hundred men and women had come from north and south, from islands and villages, over mountains and down rivers. At the call of an idea they had left their forests, their farms, their homes -- strong men, young boys, little girls, women with heads covered, and sleeping babies. "Look at these animals," said the German captain to his new chief mate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉姆看到许多本地人匆忙上船，填满了每个角落，就像往容器里注满水。这八百个男男女女从南北各地的小岛或村庄翻山涉水而来。在信仰的召唤之下，他们离开了森林、农场和家园。他们当中有身强力壮的男子，年幼的孩子，裹着头巾的女人，还有熟睡的婴儿。“瞧瞧这些畜牲们。”德国船长向新来的大副说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Patna left the port, and started across the Indian Ocean towards the Red Sea. The five white seamen lived separately from the pilgrims, who were packed close together on every deck and in every corner. The days were hot and heavy, and the ship moved slowly across a flat, lifeless sea. There were no clouds in the burning sky, and it was too hot to think or feel.</div>

There was a noise like distant thunder, and the ship trembled. The two Malays at the wheel looked at the white men, but received no orders, so did not move.
