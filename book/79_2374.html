<div class="line_en">Danny weakened and went up for his milk and cookies at quarter past four. He gobbled them while looking out the window, then went in to kiss his mother, who was lying down. She suggested that he stay in and watch "Sesame Street" -- the time would pass faster -- but he shook his head firmly and went back to his place on the curb.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now it was five o'clock, and although he didn't have a watch and couldn't tell time too well yet anyway, he was aware of passing time by the lengthening of the shadows, and by the golden cast that now tinged the afternoon light. Turning the glider over in his hands, he sang under his breath: "Skip to m Lou, n I don't care… skip to m Lou, n I don't care… my master's gone away… Lou, Lou, skip to In Lou…" They had sung that song all together at the Jack and Jill Nursery School he had gone to back in Stovington. He didn't go to nursery school out here because Daddy couldn't afford to send him anymore. He knew his mother and father worried about that, worried that it was adding to his loneliness (and even more deeply, unspoken between them, that Danny blamed them), but he didn't really want to go to that old Jack and Jill anymore. It was for babies. He wasn't quite a big kid yet, but he wasn't a baby anymore. Big kids went to the big school and got a hot lunch. First grade. Next year. This year was someplace between being a baby and a real kid. It was all right. He did miss Scott and Andy -- mostly Scott -- but it was still all right. It seemed best to wait alone for whatever might happen next.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was too bad they couldn't believe more, though, especially at times like now. Mommy was lying on her bed in the apartment, just about crying she was so worried about Daddy. Some of the things she was worried about were too grown-up for Danny to understand -- vague things that had to do with security, with Daddy's self-image feelings of guilt and anger and the fear of what was to become of them -- but the two main things on her mind right now were that Daddy had had a breakdown in the mountains (then why doesn't he call?) or that Daddy had gone off to do the Bad Thing. Danny knew perfectly well what the Bad Thing was since Scotty Aaronson, who was six months older, had explained it to him. Scotty knew because his daddy did the Bad Thing, too. Once, Scotty told him, his daddy had punched his mom right in the eye and knocked her down. Finally, Scotty's dad and mom had gotten a DIVORCE over the Bad Thing, and when Danny had known him, Scotty lived with his mother and only saw his daddy on weekends. The greatest terror of Danny's life was DIVORCE, a word that always appeared in his mind as a sign painted in red letters which were covered with hissing, poisonous snakes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他们对他半信半疑真是太糟糕了，尤其是在现在这种时候。妈妈躺在床上，眼看就要哭出来了，她在为爸爸担着心。妈妈担心的有些事对丹尼来说太大了，他不能理解，比如生活保障、爸爸的自我形象、负疚感、对未来的恐惧等等，但现在她脑子里考虑的主要是两件事：爸爸的车在山里抛了锚（那他为什么不打电话？），或爸爸“干坏事”去了。丹尼完全清楚“干坏事”是怎么回事，因为比他大六个月的斯科蒂—阿伦松给他解释过。斯科蒂的爸爸也“干坏事”，所以他知道。有一次，斯科蒂告诉丹尼，他爸爸喝多了，一拳打中了妈妈的眼睛，妈妈当场倒在了地上。后来，斯科蒂的爸爸妈妈终于因为他爸爸“干坏事”离了婚，丹尼认识他时，他跟妈妈住在一起，只有周末才能见到爸爸。平时让丹尼提心吊胆的就是“离婚”，这个词老是浮现在他脑海中，一个红色的符号，上面爬满了咝咝吐着信子的毒蛇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In DIVORCE, your parents no longer lived together. They had a tug of war over you in a court (tennis court? badminton court? Danny wasn't sure which or if it was some other, but Mommy and Daddy had played both tennis and badminton at Stovington, so he assumed it could be either) and you had to go with one of them and you practically never saw the other one, and the one you were with could marry somebody you didn't even know if the urge came on them. The most terrifying thing about DIVORCE was that he had sensed the word -- or concept, or whatever it was that came to him in his understandings-floating around in his own parents' heads, sometimes diffuse and relatively distant, sometimes as thick and obscuring and frightening as thunderheads. It had been that way after Daddy punished him for messing the papers up in his study and the doctor had to put his arm in a cast. That memory was already faded, but the memory of the DIVORCE thoughts was clear and terrifying. It had mostly been around his mommy that time, and he had been in constant terror that she would pluck the word from her brain and drag it out of her mouth, making it real. DIVORCE. It was a constant undercurrent in their thoughts, one of the few he could always pick up, like the beat of simple music. But like a beat, the central thought formed only the spine of more complex thoughts, thoughts he could not as yet even begin to interpret.</div>

<div class="line_en">They came to him only as colors and moods. Mommy's DIVORCE thoughts centered around what Daddy had done to his arm, and what had happened at Stovington when Daddy lost his job. That boy. That George Hatfield who got pissed off at Daddy and put the holes in their bug's feet. Daddy's DIVORCE thoughts were more complex, colored dark violet and shot through with frightening veins of pure black. He seemed to think they would be better off if he left.

<div class="line_en">Danny looked furtively behind him at the kitchen window. Sometimes thinking very hard made something happen to him. It made things -- real things -- go away, and then he saw things that weren't there. Once, not long after they put the cast on his arm, this had happened at the supper table. They weren't talking much to each other then. But they were thinking. Oh yes. The thoughts of DIVORCE hung over the kitchen table like a cloud full of black rain, pregnant, ready to burst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼回过头，偷偷看了一眼厨房的窗户。有时候，努力思考会给他带来某些变化：眼前的东西渐渐远去，然后他就看到原本不在那儿的东西。有一次，他的胳膊上石膏后不久，吃晚饭的时候就发生了这样的事。当时，他们都想着心事，谁也没说几句话。啊，是的，“离婚”的想法像一团蓄满水分的黑云笼罩在餐桌上方，眼看就要爆发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was so bad he couldn't eat. The thought of eating with all that black DIVORCE around made him want to throw up. And because it had seemed desperately important, he had thrown himself fully into concentration and something had happened. When he came back to real things, he was lying on the floor with beans and mashed potatoes in his lap and his mommy was holding him and crying and Daddy had been on the phone. He had been frightened, had tried to explain to them that there was nothing wrong. That this sometimes happened to him when he concentrated on understanding more than what normallv came to him. He tried to explain about Tony, who they called his "invisible playmate."</div>

The cellar was dangerous, Daddy said. That was why the landlord kept it locked. If someone was leaving it unlocked, Daddy wanted to know. He was glad to have his papers and his "PLAY" but it wouldn't be worth it to him, he said, if Danny fell down the stairs and broke his… his leg. Danny told his father earnestly that he hadn't been down in the cellar. That door was always locked. And Mommy agreed.

<div class="line_en">Danny sighed quietly and his body slumped on the curb as if all the muscles had gone out of it. He was fully conscious; he saw the street and the girl and boy walking up the sidewalk on the other side, holding hands because they were (? in love?) so happy about the day and themselves together in the day. He saw autumn leaves blowing along the gutter, yellow cartwheels of irregular shape. He saw the house they were passing and noticed how the roof was covered with (shingles. i guess it'll be no problem if the flashing's ok yeah that'll be all right. that watson. christ what a character. wish there was a place for him in "THE PLAY. " i'll end up with the whole fucking human race in it if i don't watch out. yeah. shingles. are there nails out there? oh shit forgot to ask him well they're simple to get. sidewinder hardware store. wasps. they're nesting this time of year. i might want to get one of those bug bombs in case they're there when i rip up the old shingles. new shingles. old) shingles. So that's what he was thinking about. He had gotten the job and was thinking about shingles. Danny didn't know who Watson was, but everything else seemed clear enough. And he might get to see a wasps' nest. Just as sure as his name was "Danny… Dannee…" He looked up and there was Tony, far up the street, standing by a stop sign and waving. Danny, as always, felt a warm burst of pleasure at seeing his old friend, but this time he seemed to feel a prick of fear, too, as if Tony had come with some darkness hidden behind his back. A jar -- of wasps which when released would sting deeply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼轻轻叹了口气，身子倒在路边，仿佛全身的肌肉都不是他的了。他神志完全清醒；他看得见街道，看到对面的人行道上走来一对姑娘小伙儿，他们手牵着手，因为他们在共享（爱情？）惬意的时光，美好的心情。丹尼看到金黄的秋叶打着旋儿，沿着街沟飞舞。他看到那一对儿正经过一幢房子，注意到那房子的屋顶上盖着木瓦。（木瓦。如果防水板没事，我想就没问题，是的，没问题。那个沃森，性格真特别。要在。剧本。里给他留个位置。我得当心，要不然我就会在这儿跟他妈的整个人类一起完蛋。是的，木瓦。工具棚里有打子吗？噢，妈的，忘了问他，不过，容易搞到。塞德温得五金店，黄蜂，它们每年这个时候筑巢。要是我揭旧木瓦时它们还在那儿，那就得搞颗灭虫弹。新木瓦，旧木瓦。）这就是爸爸现在的心思。他得到了工作，正想着木瓦的事。丹尼不知道沃森是谁，但别的东西都很清楚。他一定看到了一个黄蜂窝，这一点肯定得就像他的名字叫——丹尼…丹尼尼…他抬起头，看见了托尼，远远地站在一个站牌边向他招手。跟往常见到老朋友一样，丹尼感到了一股融融的暖意，可这次他似乎还体味到了一丝恐惧，好像托尼背后隐藏着一片黑云，还有一罐黄蜂——一旦放出，就会狠狠扎人。">查看中文翻译</div>
