<div class="line_en">One of these albums, Danny's personal favorite, had been an Eddie Cochran double-record set with four pages of bound-in liner notes by Lenny Kaye. Wendy had often been struck by Danny's fascination for this one particular album by a manboy who had lived fast and died young… had died, in fact, when she herself had only been ten years old.</div>

His voice was low and tuneless.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't want to see," he said low, and then looked back at the rubber ball, arcing from hand to hand. "But I can hear them sometimes, late at night.

He looked at her with his dark, frightened eyes. "It doesn't matter whether you believe me or not."</div>

<div class="line_en">Now his ears were open and he could hear them again, the gathering, ghosts or spirits or maybe the hotel itself, a dreadful funhouse where all the sideshows ended in death, where all the specially painted boogies were really alive, where hedges walked, where a small silver key could start the obscenity. Soft and sighing, rustling like the endless winter wind that played under the eaves at night, the deadly lulling wind the summer tourists never heard. It was like the somnolent hum of summer wasps in a ground nest, sleepy, deadly, beginning to wake up. They were ten thousand feet high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他耳朵又打开了，又可以听到它们了。人群、鬼、幽灵或饭店本身，一幢阴森恐怖的娱乐宫，里面所有的穿插表演全都以死亡收尾，里面所有的色彩各异的假人都有生命，树篱动物能走动，一把小小的银质钥匙能启动淫猥的表演。这声音软绵绵的，叹息着，像夜深人静时在屋檐上低回的永不停歇的寒风那样刷刷作响，也像藏在地窝里的夏蜂那令人昏昏欲睡的嗡嗡声。他们住在一万英尺高的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a living sound, but not voices, not breath. A man of a philosophical bent might have called it the sound of souls. Dick Hallorann's Nana, who had grown up on southern roads in the years before the turn of the century, would have called it ha'ants. A psychic investigator might have had a long name for it-psychic echo, psychokinesis, a telesmic sport. But to Danny it was only the sound of the hotel, the old monster, creaking steadily and ever more closely around them: halls that now stretched back through time as well as distance, hungry shadows, unquiet guests who did not rest easy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这声音活着，但不是嗓音，不是呼吸声。有哲学偏好的人会称之为灵魂的声音。哈洛伦的祖母上世纪末的那些年头里在南方长大，她称这种声音为哈安特。心理调查者可能会给出另外一些名字，如心理回声，精神迷狂或心灵感应。但是对丹尼来说，这只是饭店的声音，这个老怪物不断地在他们周围吱嘎作响，比从前任何时候离他们更近：过道现在不仅在空间上而且在时间上向后延伸，饥饿的暗影，夜不成眠的住客。">查看中文翻译</div>
