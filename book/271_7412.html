<div class="line_en">Benjamin and Tia were quick to follow after Amun and Kebi, anxious to let them know the outcome of the conflict; I was sure we would see them again -- Benjamin and Tia, at least. None of the nomads lingered. Peter and Charlotte had a short conversation with Jasper, and then they were gone, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So it was a combination of things there at the end, but what it really boiled down to was… Bella," Edward was explaining. Our family and our two remaining guests sat in the Cullens' great room while the forest turned black outside the tall windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以，一系列的问题在最后发生了本质的变化，但真正归结起来是因为——贝拉，”爱德华解释道。我和我们的家庭成员以及留下的部分客人正坐在卡伦家的客厅里，巨大的落地窗后面，是寂静的森林。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Huilen and Nahuel were the ones who stayed, though I had expected those last two to go back with the Amazons. Carlisle was deep in fascinated conversation with Huilen; Nahuel sat close beside her, listening while Edward told the rest of us the story of the conflict as only he knew it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="休伊伦和纳乌艾留了下来，我一直以为他们会和亚马逊的朋友一起离开。卡莱尔一直在着迷的和休伊伦讨论着；纳乌艾就坐在她的旁边，倾听着爱德华讲述这场冲突中只有他知道的具体情节。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiled at me with a look I didn't entirely recognize -- it was tender, but also awed and even exasperated. "When will you ever see yourself clearly?" he said softly. Then he spoke louder, to the others as well as to me. "The Volturi haven't fought a fair fight in about twenty-five hundred years. And they've never, never fought one where they were at a disadvantage. Especially since they gained Jane and Alec, they've only been involved with unopposed slaughterings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他微笑着看了我一眼，我完全无法理解他目光中的含义——温柔，但又充满敬畏甚至恼怒。“你什么时候才能看清楚你自己呢？”他轻轻的说。然后他放大了音量，好让其他人听清楚。“2500年来，沃尔图里从未遭遇公平的挑战。他们从来没有，从来没有面对一个人时让自己处于下风。尤其是在他们招罗到简和亚历克之后他们所做的只是屠杀，没有任何抵抗。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You should have seen how we looked to them! Usually, Alec cuts off all sense and feeling from their victims while they go through the charade of a counsel. That way, no one can run when the verdict is given. But there we stood, ready, waiting, outnumbering them, with gifts of our own while their gifts were rendered useless by Bella. Aro knew that with Zafrina on our side, they would be the blind ones when the battle commenced. I'm sure our numbers would have been pretty severely decimated, but they were sure that theirs would be, too. There was even a good possibility that they would lose. They've never dealt with that possibility before. They didn't deal with it well today."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你曾经见识过，我们在他们看来不值一提！通常，当他们玩弄着虚伪的法律文字游戏的时候，亚历克会负责让受害者失去一切知觉。这样一来，当裁决做出的时候，没有人能够逃脱。但是这一次，我们做好了准备迎接他们，当他们的守卫的天赋被贝拉屏蔽在外，那我们这边的天赋占有数量上的优势，阿罗知道查弗丽娜站在我们这边，那么当战斗真正开始，他们会全体变成瞎子。我确信，我们有足够的人手应对他们的攻击，但是对这一点他们一样清楚。他们甚至还有转圜的余地，但是他们没有利用。他们从来没有带着这种可能性做决定。今天他们本来可以做得更好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hard to feel confident when you're surrounded by horse-sized wolves," Emmett laughed, poking Jacob's arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Absolutely," Edward agreed. "That was another sight they've never seen. The true Children of the Moon rarely move in packs, and they are never much in control of themselves. Sixteen enormous regimented wolves was a surprise they weren't prepared for. Caius is actually terrified of werewolves. He almost lost a fight with one a few thousand years ago and never got over it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很明显，”爱德华肯定道。“这是一个他们从未见过的局面。真正的月光之子很少集结在一起，而且他们通常无法控制自己。十六个成员组成的狼人军团完全超出了他们的预料。卡尤斯确实被狼人们吓慌了。他差点就错过了一场千年难遇的战斗，并且永远都无法恢复。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob rolled his eyes and then yawned. "It's been a while since I slept in a bed. I bet my dad would get a kick out of having me under his roof again."</div>

<div class="line_en">He got up, stretched, kissed the top of Nessie's head, and then the top of mine. Finally, he punched Edward's shoulder. "See you guys tomorrow. I guess things are going to be kind of boring now, aren't they?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站起来，伸了个懒腰，轻轻的亲了亲的内希额头，然后又亲了亲我的。最后，他把手搭载了的肩爱德华膀上。“明天见，伙计。我想从现在起生活有将变得乏味了，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I fervently hope so," Edward said.</div>

<div class="line_en">We got up when he was gone; I shifted my weight carefully so that Nessie was never jostled. I was deeply grateful to see her getting a sound sleep. So much weight had been on her tiny shoulders. It was time she got to be a child again -- protected and secure. A few more years of childhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走出去的时候我们也站了起来；我小心的变化着重心的位置，这样就不会挤着内希了。我满怀感激的看着她酣睡着。今天有太多的东西要她承受了。是时候让她做回孩子了——被细心呵护，充满安全感。仅仅几年的孩提时代。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once we were across the river, we walked barely faster than human speed, in no hurry, holding hands. I was sick of being under a deadline, and I just wanted to take my time. Edward must have felt the same.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know. Like I said, impressive. It goes against the grain to say so, but she could do worse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，就像我说过的，这令我印象深刻。这样说可能令你难以接受，但是，她可能会变得很糟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I considered that for a minute. "He doesn't see her that way. He's not in a hurry for her to grow up. He just wants her to be happy."</div>

<div class="line_en">He ignored me. "He's always thought of himself as an evil creation, a murderer by nature. His sisters all killed their mothers as well, but they thought nothing of it. Joham raised them to think of the humans as animals, while they were gods. But Nahuel was taught by Huilen, and Huilen loved her sister more than anyone else. It shaped his whole perspective. And, in some ways, he truly hated himself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有理会我。“他总是认为自己是邪恶的化身，天生的凶手。他的姐妹们也都杀死了她们的母亲，但是她们毫不在意。乔厄姆引导她们将人类视为动物，而他们自己是上帝。但是纳乌艾是休伊伦教养长的的，而休伊伦比任何人都爱他的妹妹。她塑造了他整个的人生观。而且，在某种程度上，他憎恨他自己。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And then he saw the three of us -- and realized for the first time that just because he is half immortal, it doesn't mean he is inherently evil. He looks at me and sees… what his father should have been."</div>

<div class="line_en">Though Irina's sacrifice was a dark shadow against the white light, keeping the moment from perfection, the joy was impossible to deny. The life I'd fought for was safe again. My family was reunited. My daughter had a beautiful future stretching out endlessly in front of her. Tomorrow I would go see my father; he would see that the fear in my eyes had been replaced with joy, and he would be happy, too. Suddenly, I was sure that I wouldn't find him there alone. I hadn't been as observant as I might have been in the last few weeks, but in this moment it was like I'd known all along. Sue would be with Charlie -- the werewolves' mom with the vampire's dad -- and he wouldn't be alone anymore. I smiled widely at this new insight.</div>
