<div class="line_en">Skannet vaulted over the grandstand fence. He zigzagged through the traffic barriers, saw the brown shirts of the security guards start to converge, the pattern familiar. They didn't have the right angle. He slipped past them as easily as he had the tacklers on the football field years before. And he arrived at exactly the right second. There was Athena talking into the microphone, head tilted to show her best side to the cameras. Three men were standing beside her. Skannet made sure that the camera had him, and then he threw the liquid from the bottle into Athena Aquitane's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯堪尼特翻过观众看台的围栏，迂回穿过了路障。他注意到穿棕色衬衫的保安聚集过来，还是老一套，他们包抄的角度不对。他用上了几年玩橄榄球时对付对方擒抱的身法，一个滑步就绕过了他们，分秒不差。安提娜正对着麦克风讲话，她稍稍歪着头，把自己最美的一面展示给镜头。她身旁站了三个人。斯堪尼特确认了摄像机拍到他后，才把瓶子里的液体泼向安提娜·阿奎坦内的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

Boz was crazy, and people who weren't crazy would try to reason with him. He was smart enough to make them think they could win, but she knew better. She couldn't take the chance. She couldn't allow herself to take that chance…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想到了电影公司。他们一定会急疯，逼她妥协。但是他们在乎的不是她，是钱。她想到了她的朋友克劳迪娅，这本来是她出名的大好机会，她觉得一阵悲哀。她又想到了其他爱她的人，不过她知道，她承担不起心软的后果。博兹疯了，没疯的人竟还想着跟他讲道理。他很聪明，让别人以为他认输了，但是她看得更清楚。她不能冒险，她不允许自己去冒险…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time she reached the large black boulders that meant the north beach ended, she was completely out of breath. She sat, trying to slow her heart down. She looked up when she heard the caw of seagulls as they swept down and seemed to glide along the water. Her eyes filled, but she pulled herself back with determination. She swallowed past the lump in her throat. And for the first time in a long time she wished her parents weren't so far away. Some part of her felt like a small child and wished desperately to run home to safety, to someone who could put their arms around her and just make everything better. She smiled at herself then, a crooked, wry smile, remembering when she really believed that was possible. Now, she was so loved by everyone, so admired, so adored… and so what? She felt more empty than she thought any human was capable of feeling, more lonely. Sometimes when she found herself passing an ordinary woman with her husband and children, a woman living an ordinary life, she felt such longing. Stop! she told herself. Think. It's up to you. Come up with a plan and carry it through. It's not only your life that depends on you…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跑到北边海滩尽头的黑色岩崖时，她已经彻底上气不接下气了。她坐在地上，试图稳定心跳。听见咕咕的海鸥叫声，她抬头望去，看见这些鸟儿俯冲下来，掠过海面。她的眼里满是泪水，但她强忍着不让泪水流下来，压抑着喉咙里的哽咽。长久以来，她头一次希望父母离得不那么遥远。她觉得自己像个渴望回家的小孩子，回到安全的港湾，有人把她搂在怀里，能让一切好起来。她不禁苦笑，自己曾经竟然真的相信这是有可能的。现在这么多人爱慕她、渴求她、艳羡她…那又怎么样呢？她觉得自己比谁都空虚孤独。有时候，她与某个普通女人擦肩而过，这个女人也许过着平凡的生活，但她羡慕她能挽着丈夫和孩子。够了！她对自己说，好好想想吧！这取决于你自己，拿出个计划来，付诸行动。还有其他人需要你…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That day Athena Aquitane informed LoddStone Studios, the studio making one of the most costly pictures in movie history, that she would not return to work on that film. Because of the attack made on her, she feared for her life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without her, the film, a historical epic called Messalina, could not be completed. The fifty million dollars invested would be a total loss. It also meant that because of this no major studio would ever dare cast Athena Aquitane in a movie again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Boz Skannet was kept in custody overnight. His lawyer organized a press conference when he was released. Skannet told reporters that he was married to Athena Aquitane, though he had not seen her for ten years, and that what he had done was just a practical joke. The liquid was only water. He predicted that Athena would not press charges, intimating he possessed a terrible secret about her. In this he proved correct. No charges were filed.</div>
