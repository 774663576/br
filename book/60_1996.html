<div class="line_en">As long as people lived in the country, in nature, surrounded by domestic animals, in the bosom of regularly recurring seasons, they retained at least a glimmer of that paradisiac idyll. That is why Tereza, when she met the chairman of the collective farm at the spa, conjured up an image of the countryside (a countryside she had never lived in or known) that she found enchanting. It was her way of looking back, back to Paradise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Why was the word idyll so important for Tereza?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么牧歌这个词对特蕾莎如此重要？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Raised as we are on the mythology of the Old Testament, we might say that an idyll is an image that has remained with us like a memory of Paradise: life in Paradise was not like following a straight line to the unknown; it was not an adventure. It moved in a circle among known objects. Its monotony bred happiness, not boredom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们都是在《旧约》神话中养育成长的，可以说牧歌就是印在我们心中的一幅景象，犹如伊甸园的回忆：伊甸园的生活不同于那将我们引向未知的直线赛跑，也不是一次历险。它是在已知的事物中间循环移动。它的单调并非厌烦，而是幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Adam, leaning over a well, did not yet realize that what he saw was himself. He would not have understood Tereza when she stood before the mirror as a young girl and tried to see her soul through her body. Adam was like Karenin. Tereza made a game of getting him to look at himself in the mirror, but he never recognized his image, gazed at it vacantly, with incredible indifference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在伊甸园，当亚当对着泉水俯下身时，他还不知道水中看到的，就是他自己。他当然也不理解为什么特蕾莎小时候总是站在镜子前，千方百计想透过肉体看到自己的灵魂。亚当就像卡列宁。为了寻开心，特蕾莎常把卡列宁领到镜子前，可是卡列宁不认得自己的影子，漫不经心地看着它，其无动于衷，令人难以置信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever, as a child, she came across her mother's sanitary napkins soiled with menstrual blood, she felt disgusted, and hated her mother for lacking the shame to hide them. But Karenin, who was after all a female, had his periods, too. They came once every six months and lasted a fortnight. To keep him from soiling their flat, Tereza would put a wad of absorbent cotton between his legs and pull a pair of old panties over it, skillfully tying them to his body with a long ribbon. She would go on laughing at the outfit for the entire two weeks of each period.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎小时候看见母亲沾满经血的卫生巾就感到恶心，怪她不知羞耻，不把它们放在隐蔽的地方。卡列宁是只母狗，也有经期，每六个月来一次，每次持续十五天。为了不让它弄脏屋子，特蕾莎在它的腿中间垫上一大团棉花，还给它套了条自己的旧短裤，巧妙地用一根长带子系在它身上。这整整十五天里，看到它这身奇怪打扮，特蕾莎总感到好笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Comparing Adam and Karenin leads me to the thought that in Paradise man was not yet man. Or to be more precise, man had not yet been cast out on man's path. Now we are longtime outcasts, Hying through the emptiness of time in a straight line. Yet somewhere deep down a thin thread still ties us to that far-off misty Paradise, where Adam leans over a well and, unlike Narcissus, never even suspects that the pale yellow blotch appearing in it is he himself. The longing for Paradise is man's longing not to be man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡列宁与亚当的对比使我想到，在伊甸园中人还未成其为人。更确切地说，那时人还没有被抛入人之轨道。而我们，我们早已被抛入其中，我们在直线运行的时间之虚无中飞行，可是我们身上还有一根细线将我们与遥远的、雾蒙蒙的伊甸园相连，那里，亚当正俯身探向泉水，与那喀索斯不同，亚当根本不知道他看见映在水中的那个依稀的黄色小点，就是他自己。对伊甸园的怀念，就是人不想成其为人的渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From this jumble of ideas came a sacrilegious thought that Tereza could not shake off: the love that tied her to Karenin was better than the love between her and Tomas. Better, not bigger. Tereza did not wish to fault either Tomas or herself; she did not wish to claim that they could love each other more. Her feeling was rather that, given the nature of the human couple, the love of man and woman is a priori inferior to that which can exist (at least in the best instances) in the love between man and dog, that oddity of human history probably unplanned by the Creator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这混乱的思绪中，一个亵渎神明的想法在特蕾莎的脑海里萌生，怎么也摆脱不了：将她与卡列宁连接在一起的爱胜于她与托马斯之间存在的爱。这份爱更美好，而不是更伟大。特蕾莎谁都不怪，不怪自己，也不怪托马斯。她不想断言她和托马斯还会更相爱。她倒是觉得人类夫妻的这种创造，本来就是让男女之爱从根本上就不及人与狗之间可能产生的爱（至少是多种爱中最好的），这真是人类史上的怪现象，造物主当初或许并没有打算这样安排。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why is it that a dog's menstruation made her lighthearted and gay, while her own menstruation made her squeamish? The answer seems simple to me: dogs were never expelled from Paradise. Karenin knew nothing about the duality of body and soul and had no concept of disgust. That is why Tereza felt so free and easy with him. (And that is why it is so dangerous to turn an animal into a machina animata, a cow into an automaton for the production of milk. By so doing, man cuts the thread binding him to Paradise and has nothing left to hold or comfort him on his flight through the emptiness of time.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女人的月经令特蕾莎厌恶，而一只母狗行经却在她心中激起一股快乐的温情，如何解释这一切？我认为答案很简单：狗从未被逐出过伊甸园。卡列宁对肉体与灵魂的两重性一无所知，不知何为厌恶。所以，和卡列宁在一起时，特蕾莎感到非常快乐，安宁。（因此，把动物看成有生命的机器，把奶牛当成产奶的自动机器，是极其危险的：人就这样斩断了其与伊甸园相连的那根细线，因此再也没有什么能阻止他在时间之虚无中翻飞，也不能给他以任何鼓舞。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And something else: Tereza accepted Karenin for what he was; she did not try to make him over in her image; she agreed from the outset with his dog's life, did not wish to deprive him of it, did not envy him his secret intrigues. The reason she trained him was not to transform him (as a husband tries to reform his wife and a wife her husband), but to provide him with the elementary language that enabled them to communicate and live together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一点：特蕾莎接受了卡列宁当初的样子，她从未设法以自己的形象来改变它，她预先就已认可狗也有一个世界，所以不想把它占为己有，她也不想嫉妒卡列宁的秘密癖好。她养它不是为了改变它（而男人总想改变女人，女人亦想改变男人），而只是想教它一门基本的语言，使它得以与人类彼此理解，从而共同生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is a completely selfless love: Tereza did not want anything of Karenin; she did not ever ask him to love her back. Nor had she ever asked herself the questions that plague human couples: Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does he love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一种无私的爱，因为特蕾莎对卡列宁无所求。她甚至不要求爱。她从不提令夫妇头疼的诸如此类的问题：他爱我吗？他曾经更爱过别人吗？他爱我是否比我爱他更深？这是些探讨爱情、度量其深度、对其进行种种猜测和研究的问题，也许正是它们将爱情扼杀了。如果我们没有能力爱，也许正是因为我们总渴望得到别人的爱，也就是说我们总希望从别人那儿得到什么（爱），而不是无条件地投入其怀中并且只要他这个人的存在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then too: No one forced her to love Karenin; love for dogs is voluntary. (Tereza was again reminded of her mother, and regretted everything that had happened between them. If her mother had been one of the anonymous women in the village, she might well have found her easygoing coarseness agreeable. Oh, if only her mother had been a stranger! From childhood on, Tereza had been ashamed of the way her mother occupied the features of her face and confiscated her I. What made it even worse was that the age-old imperative Love your father and mother!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，特蕾莎对狗的爱是自愿的爱，没有人强迫她。（特蕾莎又一次想到了母亲，感到十分后悔：如果母亲是村子里她不熟悉的一个女人，她那乐呵呵粗野的劲儿或许会引起她的好感吧！啊！要是她母亲是个陌生人就好了！从孩童时起，特蕾莎就一直为母亲占了她的五官，夺走了她的“我”而耻辱。最糟糕的事情是，“要爱你的父母！”这千年古训迫使她不得不接受被霸占的事实，把这种侵占行为称之为爱！特蕾莎和母亲断绝了关系，这可不是母亲的错，她跟母亲断绝关系，并非因为母亲是她的模样，而是由于是她的母亲。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">forced her to agree with that occupation, to call the aggression love! It was not her mother's fault that Tereza broke with her. Tereza broke with her not because she was the mother she was but because she was a mother.) But most of all: No one can give anyone else the gift of the idyll; only an animal can do so, because only animals were not expelled from Paradise. The love between dog and man is idyllic. It knows no conflicts, no hair-raising scenes; it knows no development. Karenin surrounded Tereza and Tomas with a life based on repetition, and he expected the same from them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤其是，任何一个人都无法将牧歌献给另一个人。只有动物能做到，因为它没有被逐出伊甸园。人与狗之间的爱是牧歌一样的。这是一种没有冲突，没有撕心裂肺的场面，没有变故的爱。卡列宁围绕在特蕾莎和托马斯的身边，过着建立在重复之上的循环生活，并期望他们也这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If Karenin had been a person instead of a dog, he would surely have long since said to Tereza, Look, I'm sick and tired of carrying that roll in my mouth every day. Can't you come up with something different? And therein lies the whole of man's plight. Human time does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line. That is why man cannot be happy: happiness is the longing for repetition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡列宁如果不是一条狗，而是一个人的话，它肯定早就对特蕾莎这么说了：“听我说，我不乐意一年到头嘴里叼着一个羊角面包。你就不能给我弄点新鲜的东西吃吗？”这句话蕴含着对人类的谴责。人类之时间不是循环转动的，而是直线前进。这就是为什么人类不可能幸福的缘故，因为幸福是对重复的渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the chairman of the collective farm took his Mefisto out for a walk after work and met Tereza, he never failed to say, Why did he come into my life so late, Tereza? We could have gone skirt chasing, he and I! What woman could resist these two little pigs? at which point the pig was trained to grunt and snort. Tereza laughed each time, even though she knew beforehand exactly what he would say. The joke did not lose its charm, through repetition. On the contrary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天下班后，合作社主席都要带他的梅菲斯突散步，每次遇到特蕾莎，他都忘不了要说：“特蕾莎太太，我要是早认识他就好了！那就可以一起去追姑娘了！哪个女人能抵挡得住两头猪的进攻呀！”听见这话，梅菲斯突哼了一声，它受过这方面的训练。特蕾莎笑着，其实一分钟前她已知道主席要对她说什么。重复丝毫无损于玩笑的诱惑力。恰恰相反，在牧歌的境界里，甚至连幽默也服从于温馨的重复之法则。">查看中文翻译</div>
