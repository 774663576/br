<div class="line_en">Laila remembered a gathering once, years before at the house, on one of Mammy's good days. The women had been sitting in the garden, eating from a platter of fresh mulberries that Wajma had picked from the tree in her yard. The plump mulberries had been white and pink, and some the same dark purple as the bursts of tiny veins on Wajma's nose.</div>

"Did you know that he used to drink sharab back then, that he was crying drunk that day? It's true. Crying drunk, is what I heard. And that was midmorning. By noon, he had passed out on a lounge chair. You could have fired the noon cannon next to his ear and he wouldn't have batted an eyelash."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then came the winds, cold and raw, ripping through the city. They tore off the last of the clinging leaves, and left the trees looking ghostly against the muted brown of the hills. The season's first snowfall was light, the flakes no sooner fallen than melted. Then the roads froze, and snow gathered in heaps on the rooftops, piled halfway up frost-caked windows. With snow came the kites, once the rulers of Kabul's winter skies, now timid trespassers in territory claimed by streaking rockets and fighter jets.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for the unpredictable Uzbek commander Dostum, Rasheed said no one knew where he would stand. Dostum had fought the Soviets in the 1980s alongside the Mujahideen but had defected and joined Najibullah's communist puppet regime after the Soviets had left. He had even earned a medal, presented by Najibullah himself, before defecting once again and returning to the Mujahideen's side. For the time being, Rasheed said, Dostum was supporting Massoud.</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila passed that winter of 1992 sweeping the house, scrubbing the pumpkin-colored walls of the bedroom she shared with Rasheed, washing clothes outside in a big copper lagaan. Sometimes she saw herself as if hovering above her own body, saw herself squatting over the rim of the lagaan, sleeves rolled up to the elbows, pink hands wringing soapy water from one of Rasheed's undershirts. She felt lost then, casting about, like a shipwreck survivor, no shore in sight, only miles and miles of water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉这样度过1992年的冬天：打扫房间，擦拭她和拉希德共享的卧房那四面南瓜色的墙壁，在屋外用大铜盆浆洗衣服。有时候，她仿佛灵魂出窍，在头顶看着自己，看到她自己蹲在铜盆旁边，衣袖卷到手肘，粉红的双手将肥皂水从拉希德的内衣上拧出来。她会茫然失措，四下环顾，好像一个逃过海难的幸存者，放眼望去看不到海岸，只有无穷无尽的海水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But thinking of Tariq was treacherous because, before she could stop, she saw him lying on a bed, far from home, tubes piercing his burned body. Like the bile that kept burning her throat these days, a deep, paralyzing grief would come rising up Laila's chest. Her legs would turn to water. She would have to hold on to something.</div>

<div class="line_en">That winter, everywhere Laila turned, walls blocked her way. She thought longingly of the wide-open skies of her childhood, of her days of going to buzkashi tournaments with Babi and shopping at Mandaii with Mammy, of her days of running free in the streets and gossiping about boys with Giti and Hasina. Her days of sitting with Tariq in a bed of clover on the banks of a stream somewhere, trading riddles and candy, watching the sun go down.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they were out together, he walked alongside her, one hand gripping her by the elbow. For Laila, being out in the streets had become an exercise in avoiding injury. Her eyes were still adjusting to the limited, gridlike visibility of the burqa, her feet still stumbling over the hem. She walked in perpetual fear of tripping and falling, of breaking an ankle stepping into a pothole. Still, she found some comfort in the anonymity that the burqa provided. She wouldn't be recognized this way if she ran into an old acquaintance of hers. She wouldn't have to watch the surprise in their eyes, or the pity or the glee, at how far she had fallen, at how her lofty aspirations had been dashed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一起出门，拉希德走在她身边，一只手抓住她的手肘。对莱拉而言，到外面的街道上来变成了一种逃避伤害的活动。她的眼睛仍在适应布卡那栅格状的狭窄视野，她的双脚依然不断踩到裙边。她走路的时候总是担心会绊倒和摔倒，或者踩进地面的坑洼把脚崴了。尽管如此，掩盖了她的真面目的布卡依然给她带来一些安慰。这样的话，就算碰到她的老熟人，她也不会被认出来。她将无须看着他们为她沦落到如此地步、为她那些远大的抱负都已经烟消云散而露出惊奇、怜悯或高兴的眼神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When it was too cold to go outside, Laila ambled around the house. She walked, dragging a fingernail along the wall, down the hallway, then back, down the steps, then up, her face unwashed, hair uncombed. She walked until she ran into Mariam, who shot her a cheerless glance and went back to slicing the stem off a bell pepper and trimming strips of fat from meat. A hurtful silence would fill the room, and Laila could almost see the wordless hostility radiating from Mariam like waves of heat rising from asphalt. She would retreat back to her room, sit on the bed, and watch the snow falling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当天气太冷、不能到屋外去的时候，莱拉就在房子里面晃荡。她不洗脸，也不梳头，用一个指甲抵着墙壁，沿走廊走过去，又走回来，走下楼，又爬上来。她走啊走，直到撞见玛丽雅姆；玛丽雅姆冷漠地看她一眼，继续把一个甜椒的果柄切下来，将一块肉上面的脂肪割掉。房间中会充满一阵伤人的沉默，莱拉几乎能看到无言的敌意像沥青上蒸腾的热浪那样从玛丽雅姆身上发散出来。她会退回她的房间，坐在床上，看着纷飞的大雪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila wondered, with something like insight, if it wasn't the same for Mariam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉有某种直觉，她觉得对玛丽雅姆来说，情况可能也是一样的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam flinched, then recovered, pursed her lips. "And you're a whore. A whore and a dozd. A thieving whore, that's what you are!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆不由一愣，随即恢复了常态。“那你是一个婊子。婊子和小偷。偷东西的婊子，你就是这么一个人！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there was shouting. Pots raised though not hurled. They'd called each other names, names that made Laila blush now. They hadn't spoken since. Laila was still shocked at how easily she'd come unhinged, but, the truth was, part of her had liked it, had liked how it felt to scream at Mariam, to curse at her, to have a target at which to focus all her simmering anger, her grief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她们大叫大嚷起来。她们举起了锅，但没有摔出去。她们用其他名字称呼对方，现在莱拉一想到那些名字就会脸红。自那以后，她们再也没说过话。莱拉依然为自己的情绪那么容易失控而感到震惊，但事实上，她内心的某个角落也喜欢这样，喜欢冲着玛丽雅姆叫嚷，咒骂她，为她积聚已久的愤怒和悲哀找一个发泄的目标。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're a sad, miserable woman," Laila said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真是一个可怜又可悲的女人。”莱拉说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After, she had run upstairs and thrown herself on Rasheed's bed. Downstairs, Mariam was still yelling, "Dirt on your head! Dirt on your head!" Laila had lain on the bed, groaning into the pillow, missing her parents suddenly and with an overpowering intensity she hadn't felt since those terrible days just after the attack. She lay there, clutching handfuls of the bedsheet, until, suddenly, her breath caught. She sat up, hands shooting down to her belly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吵完架之后，她跑上楼梯，躺到拉希德的床铺上。玛丽雅姆还在楼下大喊大叫：“你去死吧！你去死吧！”莱拉当时躺在床上，对着枕头不停地呻吟；突然间，她想起了父母，自从那枚火箭弹爆炸之后这些可怕的日子以来，她第一次如此深深地怀念他们。她躺在那儿，双手死死抓住床单，然后，始料未及的是，她呼吸变得艰难了。她坐起来，双手不断朝下抚着腹部。">查看中文翻译</div>
