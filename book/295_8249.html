<div class="line_en">The clock rolled past the dinner hour and onward toward seven, but for Garrett Blake, time had stopped three years ago when Catherine had stepped off the curb and was killed by an elderly man who lost control of his car and changed the lives of two separate families forever. In the ensuing weeks, his anger at the driver eventually gave way to plans of revenge that went unfulfilled, simply because his sorrow rendered him incapable of any action whatsoever. He couldn't sleep more than three hours a night, cried whenever he saw her clothes in the closet, and lost almost twenty pounds on a diet that consisted of coffee and Ritz crackers. The following month, he started smoking for the first time in his life and turned to alcohol on nights when the pain was too unbearable for him to face sober. His father temporarily took over the business while Garrett sat in silence on the back porch of his home, trying to imagine a world without her. He had neither the will nor the desire to exist anymore, and sometimes as he sat there, he hoped that the salty, humid air would swallow him up completely so he wouldn't have to face the future alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">What made it so hard was that it seemed as though he couldn't remember a time when she wasn't around. They had known each other most of their lives and had attended the same schools throughout their younger years. In third grade they were best friends, and he gave her two cards on Valentine's Day, but after that, they drifted apart and simply coexisted as they progressed from one grade to the next. Catherine was gangly and thin, always the smallest in her class, and though Garrett always held a special place in his heart for her, he never noticed that she was slowly becoming an attractive young woman. They never went to a prom together or even to a movie, but after four years at Chapel Hill, where he majored in marine biology, he bumped into her at Wrightsville Beach and suddenly realized how foolish he had been. She was no longer the gangly girl he remembered. In a word, she was beautiful, with wonderful curves that made men and women alike turn their heads whenever she walked past them. Her hair was blond and her eyes held infinite mystery; and when he finally closed his gaping mouth and asked her what she was doing later, they started a relationship that eventually led to marriage and six wonderful years together.</div>

<div class="line_en">On their wedding night, alone in a hotel room lit only by candles, she handed him the two valentines he'd once given her and laughed aloud when she saw the expression on his face when he realized what they were. "Of course I kept them," she whispered as she wrapped her arms around him. "It was the first time I ever loved someone. Love is love, no matter how old you are, and I knew that if I gave you enough time, you'd come back to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新婚之夜，两人独自在酒店婚房里，烛光摇曳，她将他送给她的两张情人节贺卡递给他，当他意识到那是什么时无比诧异，她禁不住大笑出声。“当然，我一直保留着，”她的手臂环住了他，贴着他的耳朵喃喃说，“那是我的初恋。爱了就是爱了，和年龄没有关系，而且我知道只要我给你足够多的时间，终有一天你会回到我的身边。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett exhaled sharply, dispelling the memory like smoke. Though he could remember the events of that evening, he found that as time was rolling on, it was becoming more and more difficult to visualize exactly the way she looked. Little by little her features were beginning to vanish before his eyes, and though he knew that forgetting helped to deaden the pain, what he wanted most of all was to see her again. In three years he'd looked through the photo album only once, and that had hurt so much he'd sworn it was the last time he'd ever do it. Now he saw her clearly only at night, after he'd fallen asleep. He loved it when he dreamed of her because it seemed as though she were still alive. She would talk and move, and he would hold her in his arms, and for a moment it seemed that everything was suddenly right in the world. Yet the dreams took a toll as well, because upon waking, he always felt exhausted and depressed. Sometimes he'd go to the shop and lock himself in the office for the entire morning so he wouldn't have to talk to anyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖瑞特急促地透了口气，努力驱逐了如烟往事。尽管他能记得那天晚上的情景，但随着时间流逝，他越来越难以勾勒出她确切的模样了。她的样子开始一点一点地在他眼前消失，虽然他知道忘却能帮助他扼杀痛苦，但他最渴望的却还是能再看她一眼。三年来，他只翻看过相册一次，痛，撕心裂肺地痛，他对自己发誓那是最后一次。现在只有在晚上他才能清晰地看到她，在他的睡梦中。他喜欢那种感觉，因为那感觉就好像她还活着。她会说话，会动，他将她紧紧抱在怀里，在那一刻生活仿佛又恢复了往日的美好。然而梦也会让人无奈，因为醒来的时候，他总是感到筋疲力尽、精神压抑、神智低迷。有时候他跑去店里，整个上午将自己反锁在办公室里，不想和任何人说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded. "Unless, of course, you'd rather sail all night." With a subtle look that betrayed nothing, she opened the door to the cabin and vanished from sight. Four minutes later the boat was hastily stabilized and he opened the door to join her....</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她点了点头。“当然了，除非你宁愿整晚航行。”她脸色的表情相当微妙，但什么也没表露，她打开了通往船舱的门，从他的视线中消失了。四分钟后船匆忙停住了，他打开门去陪伴她……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His father tried to help as best he could. He, too, had lost a wife and so knew what his son was going through. Garrett still visited him at least once a week and always enjoyed the company his father provided. He was the one person Garrett shared a real understanding with, a feeling reciprocated by the old man. Last year his father had told him that he should start dating again. "It isn't right that you're always alone," he'd said. "It's almost like you've given up." Garrett knew there was a measure of truth to that. But the simple fact was that he had no desire to find anyone else. He hadn't made love to a woman since Catherine had died, and worse, he'd felt no desire for that, either. It was as if part of him were dead inside. When Garrett asked his father why he should take the advice when he himself had never re-married, his father simply looked away. But then his father said something else that haunted them both, something he later wished he hadn't said at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">In time, Garrett returned to the shop and started working again, doing his best to go on with his life. He stayed at the shop as late as he could, organizing files and rearranging his office, simply because it was less painful than going home. He found that if it was dark enough outside by the time he got back to his house and he turned on only a few lights, he didn't notice her things as much and her presence wasn't as strong. He got used to living alone again, cooking, cleaning, and doing his own laundry, and he even worked in the garden as she used to, though he didn't enjoy it as much as she did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖瑞特及时回到店里又开始工作了，竭尽所能地继续自己的生活。他待在店里，能待多晚就待多晚，整理档案和办公室，用忙碌来麻痹自己，这样不像回到家后那么痛苦。他发现，如果他回家时天已经全黑了，只打开几盏灯，她的许多东西将会隐匿在黑暗中，她的存在感也就不会那么强烈。他又习惯了单身生活，煮饭、打扫、洗衣服，甚至他还在她过去打理的花园里忙活，尽管他不像她那样从中能得到许多乐趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought he was getting better, but when the time came to pack up Catherine's things, he didn't have the heart to do it. His father eventually took matters into his own hands. After a weekend spent diving, Garrett came home to a house stripped of her belongings. Without her things, the house was empty; he no longer saw any reason to stay. He sold it within a month, moved to a smaller house on Carolina Beach, thinking that by leaving, he'd finally be able to move on. And he had, kind of, for over three years now.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next few actions came furiously. She ducked her head and watched as it all happened just the way he said it would. The boom moved above her, carrying the sail with it to capture the wind. When it was in the correct position, he used the lines to secure it again. Before she had time to blink, he was back at the wheel, making adjustments and looking over his shoulder at the sail, as if to be sure he had done everything correctly. The whole thing had taken less than thirty seconds.</div>

Like most sailboats, this one had two levels-the lower outside deck, where they were standing, and the forward deck, about four feet higher, which stretched to the front of the boat. That was where the cabin was located, and there were two small windows, coated on the outside with a thin layer of salt that made it impossible to see inside. A small door led into the cabin, low enough that people had to duck their heads to keep from bumping them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Turning back to him, she wondered how old Garrett was. In his thirties, probably-she couldn't pin it down any more than that.

It's just like any other date, she'd told herself most of the afternoon. Don't make a big deal out of this. When it was time for her to head to the docks, however, she almost didn't.

<div class="line_en">With the sun descending slowly in the evening sky behind them, Garrett led the way back to where Theresa had been sitting earlier. After making sure there wasn't anything behind her that might snag her clothes, they sat in the corner-she on the side, he against the back-angled so that they could face each other. Feeling the wind in her face, Theresa pulled her hair back, looking out over the water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett watched her as she did it. She was shorter than he was-about five feet seven, he guessed-with a lovely face and a figure that reminded him of models he had seen in magazines. But even though she was attractive, there was something else about her that caught his eye. She was intelligent, he could sense that right away, and confident, too, as if she were able to move through life on her own terms. To him, these were the things that really mattered. Without them, beauty was nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她整理头发时，盖瑞特望着她。她比他矮——他猜约有五英尺七英寸——面容娇美，身材让他不由得联想到他在杂志上看到的模特儿。尽管她很迷人，但是吸引他的却是她身上别的什么东西。她很聪明，他立即便感受到了；她也自信，就好像能用自己的方法在生活中游刃有余。对他来说，这些才是真正重要的。没有这些，美貌便不值一提。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a way, when he looked at her, he was reminded of Catherine. Especially her expression. She looked as though she were daydreaming as she watched the water, and he felt his thoughts wandering back to the last time they had sailed together.

He shook his head and absently adjusted his watchband, first loosening it, then tightening it back in its original position.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he opened his own can of soda, he looked at her, thinking about what she'd said earlier.

She didn't look that much older-that much was certain-but she didn't act like most of the twenty-somethings he knew in town.

<div class="line_en">He smiled in amusement and set the sandwich on his plate. "Well, winds are driven by differences in temperature-when warm air rushes to cooler air. For the wind to stop blowing when you're out on the ocean, you'd need the air temperature to exactly equal the water temperature for miles around. Down here, the air is usually hot during the day, but as soon as the sun starts to set, the temperature drops quickly. That's why the best time to go out is at dusk. The temperature is changing constantly, and that makes for great sailing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他感到很有趣，笑了起来，将三明治放在盘子里。“嗯，风是由温度变化带动的——当暖空气流入冷空气中时便会出现风。在海上航行时，空气的温度必须和周围几英里的水温持平，风才会彻底停下来。在我们这个地方，白天气温通常都很高，但是一旦太阳开始下山，温度就会迅速下降。这就是为何出海的最佳时间是黄昏。这时的温度一直在变化，这样才能创造出超棒的航行条件。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett also started from the beginning, talking about growing up in Wilmington as an only child. He told her that his mother had died when he was twelve, and because his father spent most of his time on the boat, he pretty much grew up on the water. He spoke about his college days-omitting some of the wilder stories that might provide a misleading impression-and described what it had been like to start the shop and what his typical days were like now.

<div class="line_en">Afterward Theresa tried to remember the last time she'd had a date like this. Not once did she feel any pressure from Garrett to see him again, nor did he seem to expect something more from her this evening. Most of the men she met in Boston seemed to share the attitude that if they went out of their way to have a pleasant evening, then something was owed in return.

<div class="line_en">When they reached a quiet point in the conversation, Garrett leaned back and ran his hands through his hair.

<div class="line_en">Theresa watched as he pointed out the stars he was talking about, musing about Garrett and the things that interested him.

<div class="line_cn" title="特丽莎顺着他的手望着他所说的那几颗星，沉思着盖瑞特以及他的那些爱好。划船、潜水、钓鱼、依靠星星导航——一切都和大海有关，似乎这些事情能让他独自一待就好几个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

"The Phoenicians were probably the greatest ocean explorers in history. In 600 B.

<div class="line_en">She nodded, imagining their faraway voyage. She wondered why she never learned such things growing up and wondered about the man who had.

And that made him unlike anyone she'd ever met before.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they moved closer to shore, Theresa suddenly doubted that they would see each other again. In a few minutes they'd be back at the docks and they would say good-bye. She doubted he would ask her to join him again, and she wasn't going to ask him herself. For some reason it didn't seem like the right thing to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们朝海岸靠近时，特丽莎突然怀疑他们是否还能再次相见。几分钟后他们就会回到码头上，然后说再见。她不相信他会再次邀请她，而她也不打算直接问他。不知为何，她感到自己主动开口似乎不妥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa walked to the stern to get the basket and her jacket, then stopped. Thinking for a moment, she picked up the basket, but instead of grabbing her jacket, she pushed it partway under the seat cushion with her free hand. When Garrett asked if everything was okay, she cleared her throat and said, "I'm just getting my things." She walked to the side of the boat, and he offered his hand. Again she felt the strength in it as she took it, and she stepped down from Happenstance onto the dock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特丽莎朝船尾走去，去拿篮子和她的外套，然后她突然停住了。想了想，她拿起篮子，没有去拿她的外套，相反，她用那只空着的手将它推到座垫下。听到盖瑞特问她是否准备好了，她清了清喉咙应道：“我在拿我的东西。”她走到船边，他向她伸出了手。当她握住他的手时又一次感到了他手上的力量，他们从“意外号”下来，走到了码头上">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They made their way through the inlet, turning toward the marina. Again he kept the boat in the center of the waterway, and Theresa saw a series of triangular signs marking the channel. He kept the sails up until approximately the same spot he'd first raised them, then lowered them with the same intensity he had used to guide the boat all evening. The engine kicked to life, and within a few minutes they had made their way past the boats that had been moored all evening. When they reached his dock, she stood on the deck while Garrett jumped off and secured Happenstance with the lines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们通过了入口处，转而朝船坞驶去。他又一次将船保持在水路中间，特丽莎看到航道上有一系列三角形标记。他将船帆升到大约他第一次升起它的位置，然后他用今晚出航过程中使用的同样的力度放下了它们。发动机响了，几分钟之内他们经过了今晚一直停泊在那里的船。当他们到达码头时，她站在甲板上，而盖瑞特跳下来，用绳子固定“意外号”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然。”她说，于是特丽莎走在他身边，他们走下码头。当他们走到她租来的小汽车边时，盖瑞特看着她在篮子里摸索找她的钥匙。找到后，她打开车门锁，拉开车门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She took her seat behind the steering wheel and turned the ignition. Garrett shut the door for her and listened as she put the car into gear. Smiling at him one last time, she glanced in the rearview mirror and slowly backed the car out. Garrett waved as she began to pull away and watched as her car finally left the marina. When she was safely on her way, he turned and walked back up the docks, wondering why he felt so unsettled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty minutes later, just as Garrett was finishing up with Happenstance, Theresa unlocked the door to her hotel room and stepped inside. She tossed her things on the bed and made her way to the bathroom. She splashed cold water on her face and brushed her teeth before undressing. Then, lying in bed with only the bedside lamp on, she closed her eyes, thinking about Garrett.</div>

<div class="line_en">David would have done everything so differently had he been the one who had taken her sailing. He would have tailored the evening to suit the charming image he wanted to project --"I just happen to have some wine, would you care for a glass?" -- and he definitely would have talked a little more about himself. But it would have been subtle-David was good at anticipating when confidence crossed the line to arrogance-and he'd have made sure not to cross that line right away. Until you knew him better, you didn't know it was a carefully orchestrated plan designed to make the best impression. With Garrett, though, she knew right away that he wasn't acting-there was something sincere about him-and she found herself intrigued by his manner. Yet had she done the right thing? She still wasn't sure about that yet. Her actions seemed almost manipulative, and she didn't like to think of herself that way.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was already done. She'd made her decision, and there wasn't any turning back now. She turned off the lamp, and once her eyes adjusted to the darkness, she looked toward the space between the loosely drawn curtains. The crescent moon had finally risen, and a little moonlight spilled onto the bed. Staring at it, she found herself unable to turn away until her body finally relaxed and her eyes closed for the night.</div>
