<div class="line_en">Outside, voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Tyrion swung his legs through the curtains and hopped to the ground, to find Magister Illyrio standing by the horses with two riders looming over him.

<div class="line_en">The dwarf's sudden silence went unnoticed, as Duck had begun to regale him with his own life story. His father had been an armorer at Bitterbridge, he said, so he had been born with the sound of steel ringing in his ears and had taken to swordplay at an early age. Such a large and likely lad drew the eye of old Lord Caswell, who offered him a place in his garrison, but the boy had wanted more. He watched Caswell's weakling son named a page, a squire, and finally a knight.

Tyrion hopped down to work the cramps out of his calves whilst Duck and Haldon were watering the horses. Tough brown grass and weed trees sprouted from the gaps between the cobbles, and the mossy walls of what once might have been a huge stone manse. After the animals had been tended to, the riders shared a simple supper of salt pork and cold white beans, washed down with ale. Tyrion found the plain fare a pleasant change from all the rich food he had eaten with Illyrio. "Those chests we brought you," he said as they were chewing.

<div class="line_en">Lord Tywin had put an end to that hope ten days before his dwarf son's sixteenth nameday, when Tyrion asked to tour the Nine Free Cities, as his uncles had done at that same age. "My brothers could be relied upon to bring no shame upon House Lannister," his father had replied. "Neither ever wed a whore." And when Tyrion had reminded him that in ten days he would be a man grown, free to travel where he wished, Lord Tywin had said, "No man is free. Only children and fools think elsewise. Go, by all means. Wear motley and stand upon your head to amuse the spice lords and the cheese kings. Just see that you pay your own way and put aside any thoughts of returning." At that the boy's defiance had crumbled. "If it is useful occupation you require, useful occupation you shall have," his father then said. So to mark his manhood, Tyrion was given charge of all the drains and cisterns within Casterly Rock. Perhaps he hoped I'd fall into one. But Tywin had been disappointed in that. The drains never drained half so well as when he had charge of them.</div>

She had a broad beam and a shallow draft, ideal for making her way up the smallest of streams and crabwalking over sandbars. A homely maid, thought Tyrion, but sometimes the ugliest ones are the hungriest once abed. The poleboats that plied the rivers of Dorne were often brightly painted and exquisitely carved, but not this maid. Her paintwork was a muddy greyish brown, mottled and flaking; her big curved tiller, plain and unadorned. She looks like dirt, he thought, but no doubt that's the point.</div>

<div class="line_en">Griff ignored the request. Instead he touched the letter to the candle flame and watched the parchment blacken, curl, and flare up. "There is blood between Targaryen and Lannister. Why would you support the cause of Queen Daenerys?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格里夫没理会这个请求，相反他把信放到了烛焰上，看着羊皮纸变黑、卷曲，燃烧起来。“兰尼斯特和坦格利安之间有血海深仇，为什么你还要支持丹妮莉丝女王的事业？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有人还疑惑究竟鸭子能否说话呢。不管怎样，格里夫。只要你愿意，你不是骑士而我是哈格尔·希山，一个小怪物。我向你保证，我所渴望的只是成为你的龙后陛下的忠实仆人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你准备如何向她尽忠？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"With my tongue." He licked his fingers, one by one. "I can tell Her Grace how my sweet sister thinks, if you call it thinking. I can tell her captains the best way to defeat my brother, Jaime, in battle. I know which lords are brave and which are craven, which are loyal and which are venal. I can deliver allies to her. And I know much and more of dragons, as your halfmaester will tell you. I'm amusing too, and I don't eat much. Consider me your own true imp."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“用我的舌头。”他一根根舔过他的手指。“我能告诉女王陛下我可爱的老姐是怎么考虑的，如果你称它为考虑的话。我可以告诉她的将领在战场上打败我老哥詹姆的最佳办法。我知道哪些领主勇敢而哪些怯懦，哪些是忠诚而哪些贪婪。我可以为她拉拢到盟友。而且对于龙，我也十分了解，你的那个半吊子学士也会这么告诉你的。我还很风趣，并且吃的不多。把我当做您忠实的小恶魔吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How kind of her." Tyrion made a waddling bow, but at the cabin door, he turned back. "What if we should find the queen and discover that this talk of dragons was just some sailor's drunken fancy? This wide world is full of such mad tales. Grumkins and snarks, ghosts and ghouls, mermaids, rock goblins, winged horses, winged pigs… winged lions."</div>
