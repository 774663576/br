<div class="line_en">The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden. The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. She had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning to like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred. The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished. Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. There were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the "snowdrops by the thousands," and about bulbs spreading and making new ones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽是个古怪、有决心的小人儿，现在有让她感兴趣的事情来用决心了，她真个被吸引进去了。她干着，挖着，有力地拔出杂草，只是干得越来越为她的工作高兴，而不是觉得疲惫。这对她是一种着魔的玩耍。她发现了更多的灰绿点点冒出来，她从没指望能发现。它们似乎到处涌现，每一天她都确信发现了新的小不点，有些小得刚够勉强探出泥土来窥视。那么的多，她记起玛莎说的“成千上万的雪花莲”，球根怎么延伸播种新的。这些球根被遗弃已有十年，也许它们已经播散了——像雪花莲——成千上万。她琢磨它们要多久才展示她自己是花。有时候她停止挖掘，看着花园，努力想像这里会是什么样儿，被成千上万可爱的东西开着花，覆盖着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But, in fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company. Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那一周的阳光里，她和季元本亲密起来。她几次从他身边忽然冒出，仿佛是从地下钻出来的。实际情况是，她担心他看到自己过来，会捡起工具就走开，于是她总是尽可能悄悄向他走去。可是，其实，他不再像开初那么反感她了。没准儿她明显想要他这个老人做伴儿，偷偷地取悦于他。另外，她也比以前文明。他不知道她第一次见到他，用对一个印度土著的态度对他说话，她不知道一个别扭、坚定的约克郡人是不知道向主人行额手礼的习俗，不知道要接受命令去做事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy about twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy's face. And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses -- and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那真的是一件怪事。她停下来看时，几乎停止了呼吸。一个男孩子坐在树下，背靠着树，吹着一只粗糙的木笛。他是个模样快乐的男孩子，大约十二岁。他看上去很干净，鼻子翘起来，他的脸深红得像罂粟花。玛丽小姐从来没有在男生脸上见过这么圆、这么蓝的眼睛。在他靠着的树干上，抓附着一只棕色松鼠，观察着他，近旁灌木丛后面，一只公野鸡优美地伸着脖子探看，离他很近有两只兔子坐起来，鼻子翕动着吸气——看情形，它们竟然都被吸引着靠近他，听着他的笛子发出奇怪的低声呼唤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she would skip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="秘密花园外蜿蜒围着一条带月桂篱笆的小径，终止于一道门，门通往公地上的一个树林。她想也许能沿这条小径溜去，看树林里有没有兔子四处蹦。她很享受跳绳，当她来到那道小门，她打开门穿过，因为她听到一道低沉的、奇异的哨音，想找出那是什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.</div>
