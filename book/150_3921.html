<div class="line_en">"Mrs. Fane?" She spoke in English with a good deal of accent, but with a correct pronunciation, and she gave the shadow of a bow. "It is a great pleasure to me to make the acquaintance of the wife of our good and brave doctor."</div>

<div class="line_en">The door opened, to Kitty's fancy not quite naturally but as though it swung back of itself on its hinges, and the Mother Superior entered the little room. She stood for an instant on the threshold and a grave smile hovered upon her lips as she looked at the laughing Sister and Waddington's puckered, clownish face. Then she came forward and held out her hand to Kitty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty felt that the Superior's eyes held her in a long and unembarrassed look of appraisal. It was so frank that it was not uncivil; you felt that here was a woman whose business it was to form an opinion of others and to whom it never occurred that subterfuge was necessary. With a dignified affability she motioned to her visitors to take chairs and herself sat down. Sister St Joseph, smiling still but silent, stood at the side but a little behind the Superior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂发现院长的眼睛长时间地盯着她，似乎是在对她做出评判，同时丝毫也没有不好意思。她的眼神十分坦率，这让凯蒂觉得她的盯视并非无礼，就好像她是一位专事品评他人为人的女士，遮遮掩掩、偷瞄斜睨从来都是多余的。她彬彬有礼同时不失和蔼地示意她的客人在椅子上坐下，自己也坐了下来。圣约瑟姐妹站在院长的一旁，但稍微靠后一点。她的脸上依然留有笑容，但此刻已经完全安静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty, impressed she hardly knew why, observed the grave lady who asked her these amiable questions. She was dressed in white and the only colour on her habit was the red heart that burned on her breast. She was a woman of middle age, she might have been forty or fifty, it was impossible to say, for there were few wrinkles on her smooth, pale face, and you received the impression that she was far from young chiefly from the dignity of her bearing, her assurance, and the emaciation of her strong and beautiful hands. The face was long, with a large mouth and large, even teeth; the nose, though not small, was delicate and sensitive; but it was the eyes, under their thin black brows, which gave her face its intense and tragic character. They were very large, black, and though not exactly cold, by their calm steadiness strangely compelling. Your first thought when you looked at the Mother Superior was that as a girl she must have been beautiful, but in a moment you realized that this was a woman whose beauty, depending on character, had grown with advancing years. Her voice was deep, low, and controlled, and whether she spoke in English or in French she spoke slowly. But the most striking thing about her was the air she had of authority tempered by Christian charity; you felt in her the habit of command. To be obeyed was natural to her, but she accepted obedience with humility. You could not fail to see that she was deeply conscious of the authority of the church which upheld her. But Kitty had a surmise that notwithstanding her austere demeanour she had for human frailty a human tolerance; and it was impossible to look at her grave smile when she listened to Waddington, unabashed, talking nonsense, without being sure that she had a lively sense of the ridiculous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂不明缘由地被这位修道院长吸引住了。她仔细观察着这个对她万般体恤的庄重女士。她穿了一袭白衣，教袍上唯一的色彩就是胸前绣着的红心。她是个中年女人，大约有四十岁或者五十岁。很难说清是四十还是五十，因为她光滑、素淡的脸上几乎看不着几丝皱纹，而从她庄重的举止、稳健的言谈，以及有力、美丽但已显干瘦的双手上，立即能够判断出她已经不再年轻。她脸形偏长，嘴稍有些大，牙齿颇为醒目。她的鼻子不能说小，但是长得十分精致，也很柔嫩。然而她的脸色之所以严峻、肃穆，则完全是因为黑黑的细眉下面的那双眼睛。这是一对黑色的大眼睛，目光平稳坚定，虽然说不上冷淡，但给人一种气势逼人的感觉。初次瞧见修道院长，你会不假思索地认为她年轻时一定是位小美人儿，但稍作片刻你便会恍然大悟，她的美丽其实与其性格密不可分，她的魅力反而会随着时光的流逝而与日俱增。她说话的声调十分低沉，显然是在有意识地加以控制。无论她说英语还是法语，都是一字一句，有条不紊。然而给人印象最深的还是她身上那股威严之气，无疑是长居基督教教职的结果。你会觉得这个人平时一定惯于发号施令，而别人也都惯于听从吩咐，不过她发号施令的仪态会十分谦逊，绝不会让人觉得她高高在上。看来她是笃信教会在世俗世界中的权威。然而凯蒂觉得在她威严的外表之下，应该还有许多人所共有的人性之处。院长在听韦丁顿厚着脸皮大放厥词之时，始终面带庄重的微笑，对幽默显然具备十足的理解力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They talked of commonplace things. The Mother Superior asked Kitty how long she had been in China and if the journey from Hong Kong had greatly tired her. She asked her if she had been in France and if she did not find the climate of Hong Kong trying. It was a conversation, trivial but friendly, which gained a peculiar savour from the circumstances. The parlour was very quiet, so that you could hardly believe that you were in the midst of a populous city. Peace dwelt there. And yet all round about the epidemic was raging and the people, terrified and restless, were kept in check but by the strong will of a soldier who was more than half a brigand. Within the convent walls the infirmary was crowded with sick and dying soldiers, and of the orphans in the nuns' charge a quarter were dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们闲聊了一些琐事。修道院长询问凯蒂来中国有多久了，从香港到此地旅途是否劳累，以及她到没到过法国、在香港是否水土不服云云。话题琐屑至极，但气氛却十分融洽，显得与他们身处的危险环境格格不入。屋子外面十分安静，让人很难相信这里是一座人口众多的城市的中心。然而静谧降临了，瘟疫却并未随之平息，还在到处肆虐；陷入恐慌的人们四处奔逃，却被暴徒似的士兵厉声喝止。修道院墙内的医疗室挤满了染病以及将死的士兵，修女们领养的孤儿们已经死去四分之一了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was some other quality in her which Kitty vaguely felt, hut could not put a name to. It was something that notwithstanding the Mother Superior's cordiality and the exquisite manners which made Kitty feel like an awkward schoolgirl, held her at a distance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而凯蒂隐约觉得她身上还有种东西，只是说不出来是什么。它就在修道院长郑重端庄的仪态和优雅周到的礼节之中——相形之下，凯蒂简直就成了扭扭捏捏的女校学生——它令凯蒂觉得她们之间始终隔着一段距离。">查看中文翻译</div>
