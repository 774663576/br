<div class="line_en">While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den -- the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl -- brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.</div>

<div class="line_en">At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling's hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour's cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors. He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="机灵鬼、查理贝兹少爷和基特宁先生坐在他身后的一张桌子旁边，他们正在聚精会神地玩惠斯特牌戏，机灵鬼和明手，对贝兹少爷和基特宁先生。首先提到名字的那位绅士无论什么时候都显得聪明过人，此时脸上又多了一分微妙的表情念的否定；3．“合题”，“正反”二者的统一，扬弃了前两个，一方面专心打牌，一方面紧盯着基特宁先生的手，只要机会合适，就敏锐地看一眼基特宁先生手上的牌，根据对邻居的观测结果，巧妙地变换自己的打法。这是一个寒冷的夜晚，机灵鬼戴着帽子，一点不假，这本来就是他在室内的习惯。他牙缝里照例叼着一根陶制烟斗，偶尔把烟斗移开片刻，这也只是在他认为有必要从桌上放着的一只酒壶里喝两口提提精神的时候，这只容量一夸脱的壶里盛着供大家享用的掺水杜松子酒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be "blowed," or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling. It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝兹少爷玩得也很专心，可是由于天性比起他那位技艺娴熟的同伴更容易激动，看得出他品尝掺水杜松子酒的次数比较频繁，外加一个劲地打哈哈，牛头不对马嘴地瞎扯一气，跟一副讲究学问的牌局很不相称。的的确确，机灵鬼本着为朋友两肋插刀的精神，不止一次借机向同伴严肃指出，这种举止很不得体。贝兹少爷对绝大部分忠告都没有计较，只是请同伴“识相些”，否则干脆把脑袋伸进一个麻袋里去得了，要不就是用这一类巧妙的俏皮话来回敬对方，基特宁先生听了这些妙语佩服得不得了。值得注意的是，后一位绅士和他的搭挡老是输，这种情况非但没有惹恼贝兹少爷，反倒好像替他提供了极大的乐趣，他每打完一局都要喧闹不堪地大笑一阵，发誓说有生以来从未见过这样有趣的游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老犹太听出基特宁先生火气相当地大，赶紧向他担保没有人在笑，为了证明在座各位都很严肃，便问罪魁祸首贝兹少爷是不是这样。然而不幸的是，查理刚开口回答，说他一辈子从来不像现在这样严肃，又忍不住前仰后合地放声大笑起来。备受羞辱的基特宁先生二话不说，冲过去对准肇事者就是一拳。贝兹少爷躲避打击向来就很老练，猛一低头躲开了，时机又选得恰到好处，结果这一拳落到了那位快活老绅士的胸日上，打得他摇摇晃晃，直退到墙边，站在那里拚命喘气，基特宁先生失魂落魄地望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. It was all of no use. Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托比虽然显得疲惫不堪，但眉宇之间仍保持着那种一贯的怡然自得的神气，真是没得治了，透过油泥污垢、胡须鬓角显现出来的仍旧是花花公子托比格拉基特那一副自鸣得意的傻笑。老犹太焦躁地站起来，一边盯着托比一点一点把食物送进嘴里，一边激动难忍在屋里踱来踱去。这一招也完全不起作用。托比摆足了旁若无人的派头，一直吃到再也吃不下去，这才吩咐机灵鬼出去，关上门，兑了一杯酒，定了定神，准备发话。">查看中文翻译</div>
