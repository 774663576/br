<div class="line_en">The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots, which is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it was impossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must have been some error in the division of the log-line, or some mistake in heaving the log. A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to be decided when there should be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the log-line, and, being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the log himself. Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of the paquet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment, and own'd his wager lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位船长说这只船的速度曾经有一次达到十三海里，计算起来，就是每小时十三海里。我们船上的乘客中有一位海军的肯纳特上校，他力辩说这是不可能的，没有船能驶得这么快，一定是船长把测线上的标度弄错了，或是掷测线时出了毛病。他们两个人就打了赌，等候有足够风力的时候就可以决定胜负。于是肯纳特仔细端详那根测线，认为满意以后，他就决定亲自动手来测量。于是过了几天，当风力很强时，邮船的船长劳特威说他相信当时船行的速度是十三海里，肯纳特就进行了测量，结果他承认自己赌输了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as possible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she was loaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been all plac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd further aft, on which the ship recover'd her character, and proved the sailer in the fleet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们启碇前，我们的船长大大地夸奖了他那只船速度很快。但是不幸得很，航行一开始，它被证明是九十六只帆船中行动最迟缓的一只，这使得船长非常懊丧。关于行动迟缓的原因船长做了许多猜测，有一次我们靠近另外一只几乎跟我们一样慢的船，但是那只船却追上我们了，这时船长命令全体人员跑到船尾去，尽可能地站在旗杆附近。连乘客在内，我们约共有四十人。当我们站在船尾时，船的速度就加快了，一忽儿就把附近的一只船远远地落在后面了。这清楚地证明了我们船长所猜想的是确实的：就是船首装得太重了。似乎这是因为大桶的水都放在船首，因此他命令把这些水桶向船尾搬动。以后这只船就恢复了它的本性，成为全队中最优良的帆船。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have often observ'd different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches, the wind being the same. One would have the sails trimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem'd to have no certain rule to govern by. Yet I think a set of experiments might be instituted, first, to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place for the masts: then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading. This is an age of experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be of great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使在海上的简单驾驶操作方面，我也常常看到在不同值班时间里，不同船员的不同做法，虽然风力并无变更。一个船员比另一个船员把帆篷扯转得多一些或少一些，所以似乎并没有一定可资遵循的规程。但是我想或许可以做一系列的实验：首先，决定最适合于速航的船身式样；第二，桅杆最合适的尺寸和放置桅杆最合适的位置；按着帆篷的式样、数量和跟着风向的不同各种扯帆的方式；最后，装货的方法。现在是实验时代，我想做这样一系列设计精确和相互配合起来的实验，是大有裨益的。因此，我相信在不久的将来，一些聪明的科学家会从事这种研究，我祝他们成功！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The above fact I give for the sake of the following observation. It has been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building, that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailing ship has been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on the contrary, remarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly be occasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system; and the same vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain, shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another. Besides, it scarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, and sail'd by the same person. One man builds the hull, another rigs her, a third lades and sails her. No one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others, and, therefore, can not draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记载上面这个事实是为了说明下面这一点。作为造船术上的一个缺点，据说一只新船造好后，究竟它是否是一只优良的帆船，非要等到试航后才能知道，因为尽管你严格地按照一只好船的模型仿造，新船造好后相反地会变成十分呆滞。我想这一部分是由于海员们对于装货、装帆和驶帆的方式各有千秋，每人有他自己的一套方法。同一只船，按照一个船长的判断和命令装货，行驶起来会比它在另外一个船长的指挥下来得快或慢。并且从来没有一只船是由同一人制造、装备和驾驶的。一个人造船身，另一个人装帆，第三个人装货和驾驶。他们当中没有一个人能够完全了解其他人的思想和经验，因此当这几方面合起来的时候，就很难得到正确的结论了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called, "Look well out before there," and he as often answered, "Ay ay; " but perhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, they sometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see a light just before us, which had been hid by the studdingsails from the man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'd a great alarm, we being very near it, the light appearing to me as big as a cart-wheel. It was midnight, and our captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing; an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rocks on which the light-house was erected. This deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses, and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America, if I should live to return there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们有一个看守人安置在船首，他们常向他叫喊“仔细看前面的地方”，他就回答：“是，是”，但是可能这时候他正闭着眼睛在半睡的状态中。据说他们有时候只是机械地回答；因为在我们前面的灯他却没有看见。这个灯给副帆遮住了，所以掌舵的和其他值班的人都没有看到，但是由于船身偶然一偏，他们发现了这个灯，因此大惊失色，因为我们离开这个灯已经很近了，灯光看去大似车轮。这时正是午夜，我们的船长正在酣睡，但是肯纳特上校跳上甲板，看到了危险，命令调转船头，所有风篷都扯着，这一动作对桅杆来说是危险的，但是这一来却使我们躲开了礁石，故此我们幸免于难，因为当时我们正向着装置着灯塔的礁石驶去。这次脱险使我特别强烈地感到灯塔的效用，使我决心提倡在美洲修建更多的灯塔，如果我能生还美洲的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We were several times chas'd in our passage, but outsail'd every thing, and in thirty days had soundings. We had a good observation, and the captain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if we made a good run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning, and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemy's privateers, who often crus'd near the entrance of the channel. Accordingly, all the sail was set that we could possibly make, and the wind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it, and made great way. The captain, after his observation, shap'd his course, as he thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron. This indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在海上我们几次受到了敌人的追击，但是我们比谁都走得快，在三十天之内我们驶到浅水地区了。我们的航海测量很准确，船长根据他的判断把我们带到非常靠近我们的港口法尔马斯的地方，如果我们在夜里迅速航行，在早晨我们或许就停在港口了，并且夜间航行可以避免敌方私掠船的注意，因为它们常在海峡口附近巡逻。于是我们扯起了所有的帆，因为那天风力很强，我们向前直驶，进程甚速。船长在测量以后决定了航线，以为一定可以远远地避开细黎群岛。但是在圣乔治海峡里似乎有时候有一股强烈的向岸流，它经常使海员上当，曾经使得克劳斯莱·萧佛尔爵士的舰队覆没。这股向岸流或许就是我们遇到事故的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">AS SOON as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me, I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended, and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain. He was against an immediate complaint to government, and thought the proprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who might possibly be induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends, to accommodate matters amicably. I then waited on my old friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's, who was then President of the Council and wished to see me as soon as possible. I agreed to go with him the next morning. Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that nobleman's, who receiv'd me with great civility; and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in America and discourse thereupon, he said to me: "You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution; you contend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion. But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in Council, after which they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land, for the king is the LEGISLATOR OF THE COLONIES." I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs. He assur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings. I recollected that about 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions laws in the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons, for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty, till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they had refus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理先生早已替我安排好了寓所，我安顿下来以后马上就去拜访方寿节博士。有人向他大力推荐我，同时人们也劝我去请教他关于诉讼的程序。他反对马上向政府提出控告，他主张私人先跟业主们商量，经过朋友们的调停和劝导，业主们或许愿意友好解决。接着我就去访问我的老友和通信者彼得·柯令逊先生，他告诉我那个弗吉尼亚大商人约翰·韩布雷要求他等我一到马上就通知他，使他可以带我去见枢密院议长葛兰费勋爵，这位勋爵希望能够尽快地见到我，我同意第二天上午跟他同去。于是韩布雷先生来接我，跟我同坐着他的马车去见那位贵人。葛兰费勋爵待我谦恭有礼，在询问和谈论了一些关于美洲现状的问题以后，他对我说：“你们美洲人对于你们的政体有一种错误的看法：你们力争国王对他州长的训令并非法律，以为你们可以任意自由决定遵守与否。但是这些训令与公使出国时所带的有关细小仪节的袖珍指南不同，它们首先由熟谙法律的法官们起草，然后在枢密院里考虑、辩论或修改，最后由国王签署。所以这些训令，从你们方面来说，是国法，因为英王是‘殖民地的立法者’。”我告诉葛兰费勋爵这对我是闻所未闻。根据我们的特许状我一向以为我们的法律是由我们的议会制订的，这当然要呈请国王批准，但是一经批准，国王就无权加以废除或更改。所以虽然议会不经国王批准不能制订永久性的法律，但是不得到议会的同意国王也不能立法。他力言我是完全错误的。但是我不同意。葛兰费勋爵的谈话使我对于英王政府对于我们的可能想法稍稍有点担心，我一回到寓所，就把这次谈话记下来。我记得大约在二十年以前，内阁向国会提出的议案中有一条，提议把国王的训令作为殖民地的法律，但是众议院否决了这一条款，当时我们还因此爱戴他们，以为他们是我们的朋友，自由的友人。到了一七六五年从他们对我们的举动中看来，好像他们以前拒绝与国王以统治权，目的只是为了替他们自己保留这一特权罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were near our port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight. About nine o'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, the town of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that surrounded it. This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasion'd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了早晨，通过锤测等方法，发现我们已经驶近我们的港口了，但是大雾弥漫，见不到陆地。约在九时左右，雾渐渐地散了，好像剧院里的幕幔一样，雾从水上升了起来，在幕下看到了法尔马斯的市镇、港内的船只和四周的田野。对那些长时期以来除了单调的茫茫大海以外别无所见的人，这是一种最动人的景色，同时使我们更感到快慰的是现在我们再不必因为战争而担忧了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement. However, it was concluded that I should give them the heads of our complaints in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them. I did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly. He was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal that he and I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves, and refus'd treating with any one but them. They then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. What it was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not such.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时我们的距离很远，双方的意见相距十万八千里，简直没有达成协议的希望，但是最后决定要我把我们控诉的项目用书面一一列出交给他们，他们答应加以考虑。不久以后我就照办了。但是他们把我们的控诉交给他们的律师斐迪南·约翰·鲍黎，他在他们跟邻州马里兰的业主鲍得摩尔勋爵的大诉讼案中替他们办理过法律事务，这件大诉讼案已经继续了七十年之久。业主们与州议会争执中的所有文件和咨文都是鲍黎执笔的。他生性傲慢，脾气暴躁，由于过去在州议会的复文中我有时对他的文件抨击稍严，因为这些文件事实上是说理浅薄，措辞蛮横，所以他与我结下了不解之仇，每次我们见面，他总是露出这种仇恨，业主们提出要我和他单独讨论控诉的各项事务，我拒绝了，除了业主们自己以外我不愿跟任何人谈判。以后，根据鲍黎的建议，他们把我们的控诉交给检察长和副检察长，要求他们提出意见和处理办法，在他们手里这件案子足足搁了一整年只差八天。在这期间我屡次向业主们要求答复，但是他们的回答总是他们还没有接到检察长和副检察长的意见。但是当他们接到检察长和副检察长的意见时，究竟内容是什么，我从来未曾知道，因为他们不告诉我。但是他们写了一篇冗长的咨文（由鲍黎起稿和签署的）寄给州议会，讲到我的控诉书，说我粗鲁无礼，措辞不当，同时也替他们自己的行动作了些浅薄的辩解，最后表示如果州议会派遣一个公正坦率的人来跟他们谈判，他们愿意和解。他们用这种方式暗示我不是这样的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent. Accordingly they petition'd the king in Council, and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act, and two by me in support of it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and the proprietaries who were in odium with the people, left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined. We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and would have no such effect. That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves. This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides, except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal, for that the money, L100,000, being printed and given to the king's use, expended in his service, and now spread among the people, the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and the total discouragement of future grants, and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms. On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel rose, and beckoning me took me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if I was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act. I said certainly. "Then," says he, "you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point." I answer'd, "None at all." He then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship's proposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the Province for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where finally the law was allowed to pass. Some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's tax having been levied by the act before the order of Council arrived, they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries. After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'd a report that they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是当这个议案送到英国来的时候，业主们根据鲍黎的建议，决定反对由国王加以批准。于是他们在枢密院里向国王请愿，接着枢密院就定期审案，业主们雇用了两个律师反对这个议案，我也雇用两个律师拥护这个议案。他们供述这个议案的目的是在使业主的财产负担过重的捐税，以便减轻人民的负担。如果这个法律继续有效，由于人民对业主有反感，业主们在捐税负担方面就只好由人民任意摆布，他们必然会破产。我们说这个议案并没有这样的企图，结果也绝不会如此，我们说估税员都是诚实和谨慎的人，他们立誓要公平合理地估税，如果增加了业主们的税额，他们每人从减轻自己捐税中所能期望得到的利益是非常渺小的，他们决不至于因此毁誓背约。根据我的记忆，这是双方陈词的要旨，此外我们强调指出这一法律废除后的危险后果，因为我们已经发行了十万镑金额的纸币，供给英王使用，用于英王军务，现在纸币已经在民间流通，法律一旦废除，在人民手中的纸币就成了废纸了，许多人会因此而破产，将来要发行补助金就完全没有把握了。我们强调指出业主们损人利己的品质，仅仅因为他们无中生有地害怕他们的财产会负担过重的捐税，他们就教唆他人造成这样巨大的灾难。讲到这里，枢密院的一位大臣曼斯非尔德勋爵站了起来，向我招招手，当律师们正在进行辩论时，把我拉到秘书室里，问我是否真正相信在执行这法律时业主的财产不致受到歧视。我说当然。他说：“那么你不会反对立约担保这一点吧？”我说：“并不反对。”接着他把鲍黎叫了进来，经过一些讨论以后，双方接受了曼斯非尔德勋爵的建议。枢密院的秘书就起草了这样一个文件，我和查理先生在上面签了字，查理先生是宾州的代理人，处理日常事务的，然后曼斯非尔德勋爵回到了枢密院会议室，最后这条法律就批准了。但是枢密院建议作某些修正，我们也保证把这些修正放在附随法里，但是州议会认为无此必要，因为在枢密院的命令到达之前，这个法律的第一年捐税已经征收了。州议会指定了一个委员会检查估税员的工作，他们委任了几个业主们的密友作为委员。经过了详细的调查以后，他们全体一致地签署了一个报告，证明估税工作是完全公平无私的。">查看中文翻译</div>
