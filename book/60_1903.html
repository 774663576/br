<div class="line_en">Being a woman is a fate Sabina did not choose. What we have not chosen we cannot consider either our merit or our failure. Sabina believed that she had to assume the correct attitude to her unchosen fate. To rebel against being born a woman seemed as foolish to her as to take pride in it.</div>

<div class="line_en">During one of their first times together, Franz announced to her, in an oddly emphatic way, Sabina, you are a woman. She could not understand why he accentuated the obvious with the solemnity of a Columbus who has just sighted land. Not until later did she understand that the word woman, on which he had placed such uncommon emphasis, did not, in his eyes, signify one of the two human sexes; it represented a value. Not every woman was worthy of being called a woman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们初遇时，一次，弗兰茨用一种奇特的语调对她说：“萨比娜，您是个女人。”她不明白，他为什么会以哥伦布刚刚望见美洲海岸一样庄严的声调向她宣告这个消息。后来她才了解，他特别强调说出的“女人”这个词，对他而言，不是用来指称人类的两种性别之一，而是代表着一种价值。并非所有的女人都称得上是女人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But if Sabina was, in Franz's eyes, a woman, then what was his wife, Marie-Claude? More than twenty years earlier, several months after Franz met Marie-Claude, she had threatened to take her life if he abandoned her. Franz was bewitched by the threat. He was not particularly fond of Marie-Claude, but he was very much taken with her love. He felt himself unworthy of so great a love, and felt he owed her a low bow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，如果萨比娜对弗兰茨而言是女人，那玛丽—克洛德，他真正的配偶，于他而言又是什么呢？二十多年前（那时他俩才认识几个月），她威胁他说，如果他抛弃她，她就自杀。这一吓，倒把弗兰茨迷惑住了。玛丽—克洛德并不那么讨他喜欢，但她对他的爱在他看来无与伦比。他自觉配不上如此伟大的爱情，而对这份爱，他认为应该深深地低下头来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he was twelve, she suddenly found herself alone, abandoned by Franz's father. The boy suspected something serious had happened, but his mother muted the drama with mild, insipid words so as not to upset him. The day his father left, Franz and his mother went into town together, and as they left home Franz noticed that her shoes did not match. He was in a quandary: he wanted to point out her mistake, but was afraid he would hurt her. So during the two hours they spent walking through the city together he kept his eyes fixed on her feet. It was then he had his first inkling of what it means to suffer.</div>

<div class="line_en">What he did not know was that Sabina was charmed more by betrayal than by fidelity. The word fidelity reminded her of her father, a small-town puritan, who spent his Sundays painting away at canvases of woodland sunsets and roses in vases. Thanks to him, she started drawing as a child. When she was fourteen, she fell in love with a boy her age. Her father was so frightened that he would not let her out of the house by herself for a year. One day, he showed her some Picasso reproductions and made fun of them. If she couldn't love her four-teen-year-old schoolboy, she could at least love cubism. After completing school, she went off to Prague with the euphoric feeling that now at last she could betray her home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，吸引萨比娜的是背叛，而不是忠诚。“忠诚”一词让她想到她父亲，一个外省的清教徒，星期日，他总爱画挂在树梢的落日或是花瓶里的玫瑰，以此为乐。受他的熏陶，她很小便开始绘画。十四岁时她爱上了一个同龄的男孩。他父亲惊恐极了，整整一年不许她单独外出。有一天，他拿出一些毕加索的复制品来给她看，对那些画大加嘲笑。既然她无权去爱那个同龄的男孩，至少可以爱立体派美术。中学毕业后，她便去了布拉格，这下终于可以背叛自己的家了，心中感到一丝宽慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz often spoke about his mother to Sabina, perhaps even with a certain unconscious ulterior motive: he assumed that Sabina would be charmed by his ability to be faithful, that it would win her over.</div>

<div class="line_en">Betrayal. From tender youth we are told by father and teacher that betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. But what is betrayal? Betrayal means breaking ranks. Betrayal means breaking ranks and going off into the unknown.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, she was not allowed to paint like Picasso. It was the period when so-called socialist realism was prescribed and the school manufactured Portraits of Communist statesmen. Her longing to betray her rather remained unsatisfied: Communism was merely another rather, a father equally strict and limited, a father who forbade her love (the times were puritanical) and Picasso, too. And if she married a second-rate actor, it was only because he had a reputation for being eccentric and was unacceptable to both fathers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在美术学院注册上学，但是不允许像毕加索那样作画，必须遵从所谓的社会主义现实派画法。在美术学院，画的都是共产主义国家元首的肖像。她企图背叛父亲的愿望仍未得到满足，因为共产主义不过是另一个父亲，同样严厉而狭隘，禁止爱情（当时是清教徒时代），也禁止毕加索。她嫁了一个平庸的布拉格演员，原因很简单，就因为他有离经叛道的坏名声，双方父亲都认为他不可接受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她十分内疚，从父亲的角度来说，爱画花瓶中的玫瑰而不爱毕加索，就那么不好？担心自己的女儿十四岁就怀个孩子跑回家又有什么可指摘的呢？失去了妻子就活不下去真可笑吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="音乐">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For Franz music was the art that comes closest to Dionysian beauty in the sense of intoxication. No one can get really drunk on a novel or a painting, but who can help getting drunk on Beethoven's Ninth, Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, or the Beatles' White Album? Franz made no distinction between classical music and pop. He found the distinction old-fashioned and hypocritical. He loved rock as much as Mozart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对弗兰茨来说，最接近于酒神狄俄尼索斯那种狂醉之美的，是艺术。靠小说和画幅难以自遣，但是听贝多芬的《第九交响曲》，巴托克的《钢琴二重奏鸣曲》，或是披头士的一支歌，就能自我陶醉。弗兰茨对高雅音乐和轻音乐不加区分。区分在他看来是虚伪而老套的。他对摇滚乐和莫扎特的喜爱不偏不倚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But if we betray B., for whom we betrayed A., it does not necessarily follow that we have placated A. The life of a divorcee-painter did not in the least resemble the life of the parents she had betrayed. The first betrayal is irreparable. It calls forth a chain reaction of further betrayals, each of which takes us farther and farther away from the point of our original betrayal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，如果当初你为了B而背叛了A，如今又背叛了B时，并不意味着要与A重归于好。离婚后，女艺术家的生活并不像她所背弃的父母的生活。第一次的背叛是不可挽回的。它引起更多的背叛，如同连锁反应，一次次地使我们离最初的背叛越来越远。">查看中文翻译</div>

During her years at the Academy of Fine Arts, students had been required to spend whole summer vacations at a youth camp. They lived in common quarters and worked together on a steelworks construction site. Music roared out of loudspeakers on the site from five in the morning to nine at night. She felt like crying, but the music was cheerful, and there was nowhere to hide, not in the latrine or under the bedclothes: everything was in range of the speakers. The music was like a pack of hounds that had been sicked on her.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the time, she had thought that only in the Communist world could such musical barbarism reign supreme. Abroad, she discovered that the transformation of music into noise was a planetary process by which mankind was entering the historical phase of total ugliness. The total ugliness to come had made itself felt first as omnipresent acoustical ugliness: cars, motorcycles, electric guitars, drills, loudspeakers, sirens. The omnipresence of visual ugliness would soon follow.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner, they went upstairs to their room and made love, and as Franz fell asleep his thoughts began to lose coherence. He recalled the noisy music at dinner and said to himself, Noise has one advantage. It drowns out words. And suddenly he realized that all his life he had done nothing but talk, write, lecture, concoct sentences, search for formulations and amend them, so in the end no words were precise, their meanings were obliterated, their content lost, they turned into trash, chaff, dust, sand; prowling through his brain, tearing at his head, they were his insomnia, his illness. And what he yearned for at that moment, vaguely but with all his might, was unbounded music, absolute sound, a pleasant and happy all-encompassing, over-powering, window-rattling din to engulf, once and for all, the pain, the futility, the vanity of words. Music was the negation of sentences, music was the anti-word! He yearned for one long embrace with Sabina, yearned never to say another sentence, another word, to let his orgasm fuse with the orgiastic thunder of music. And lulled by that blissful imaginary uproar, he fell asleep.</div>
