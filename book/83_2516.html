<div class="line_en">Captain Gregory of the Missing Persons Bureau laid my card down on his wide flat desk and arranged it so that its edges exactly paralleled the edges of the desk. He studied it with his head on one side, grunted, swung around in his swivel chair and looked out of his window at the barred top floor of the Hall of Justice half a block away. He was a burly man with tired eyes and the slow deliberate movements of a night watchman. His voice was toneless, flat and uninterested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="失踪人口调查局的格里高利上尉把我的名片放在他宽敞的书桌上，还调节了一下摆的位置，好让卡片边缘与桌子边线完全平行。他脑袋歪向一边，端详着名片，嘟囔了一声，在转椅上转了一圈，望向窗外半个街区之遥的法院那嵌着栅栏的窗子。他身材魁梧，眼神倦怠，一举一动像个巡夜人，缓慢而审慎。他的声音里没有语调，平板、淡漠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“从没见过他。都是听来的：他是个英俊的爱尔兰人，四十岁不到；以前走私过酒；他娶了斯特恩伍德将军的大女儿，夫妻俩合不来。别人告诉我他一个月前不见了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah -- but it can be done -- for a while." He touched a bell button on the side of his desk. A middle-aged woman put her head in at a side door. "Get me the file on Terence Regan, Abba."</div>

<div class="line_en">The door closed. Captain Gregory and I looked at each other in some more heavy silence. The door opened again and the woman put a tabbed green file on his desk. Captain Gregory nodded her out, put a pair of heavy horn-rimmed glasses on his veined nose and turned the papers in the file over slowly. I rolled a cigarette around in my fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门关了。格里高利上尉和我又互相看了对方一会儿，完全不说话。门又开了，那妇女将一个贴了检索标签的绿色文件夹放在桌上。格里高利上尉点头示意她出去，拿起一副看上去很重的角质镜架眼镜戴在青筋突起的鼻子上，缓缓翻阅着文件夹里的材料。我手里夹着一根烟，在指间翻来翻去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He blew on the sixteenth of September," he said. "The only thing important about that is it was the chauffeur's day off and nobody saw Regan take his car out. It was late afternoon, though. We found the car four days later in a garage belonging to a ritzy bungalow court place near the Sunset Towers. A garage man reported it to the stolen car detail, said it didn't belong there. The place is called the Casa de Oro. There's an angle to that I'll tell you about in a minute. We couldn't find out anything about who put the car in there. We print the car but don't find any prints that are on file anywhere. The car in that garage don't jibe with foul play, although there's a reason to suspect foul play. It jibes with something else I'll tell you about in a minute."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是九月十六号走的，”他说，“这个日子能提供的唯一一条重要线索是那天司机放假，没人看到里根开车离开。不过当时是傍晚。四天后，我们在日落大道附近一个气派的大别墅的车库里找到了那辆车。看车库的人报了警，对失窃车辆侦查组说那辆车是别处的。那地方叫‘奥罗居’。这里头有个问题，大概一分钟之后我会告诉你。至于谁把车停到那儿的，我们没有任何发现。我们提取了车上的指纹，但哪儿都没找到跟档案中匹配的。看那车在车库里的样子，不太像跟凶杀案有牵连，虽然确实有理由怀疑出了命案。倒是比较像跟别的事有关，究竟是什么，我大概一分钟后告诉你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah. Eddie Mars and his wife didn't live together, but they were friendly, Eddie says. Here's some of the possibilities. First off Regan carried fifteen grand, packed it in his clothes all the time. Real money, they tell me. Not just a top card and a bunch of hay. That's a lot of jack but this Regan might be the boy to have it around so he could take it out and look at it when somebody was looking at him. Then again maybe he wouldn't give a damn. His wife says he never made a nickel off of old man Sternwood except room and board and a Packard one-twenty his wife gave him. Tie that for an ex-legger in the rich gravy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。艾迪·马尔斯和他妻子分居了，但艾迪说，他俩关系挺好。这里面有几种可能性。首先，里根永远在衣服里装着一万五千块。他们告诉我，都是如假包换的现钞。并不是面上一张真钱，底下一捆破纸。偷窃抢劫的事时常发生，但这个里根就爱显摆，把钱带出来，好在别人紧盯的目光下数钱。也可能他根本不在乎。他老婆说里根除了膳宿和那辆她送他的帕卡德，他从来不向老斯特恩伍德要一分钱。而且他以前是个发过横财的走私犯。你把这两件事结合起来想想。”">查看中文翻译</div>

A guy who sounds a bit like Regan had been seen with her, but we don't get a positive identification. It's goddamned funny in this police racket how an old woman can look out of a window and see a guy running and pick him out of a line-up six months later, but we can show hotel help a clear photo and they just can't be sure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他面露怒色。“对。我们调查了房客，发现她住在那儿。是跟里根差不多时间走的，肯定不超过两天。有人看到她以前跟一个男人在一起，听描述那家伙蛮像里根，不过我们没有得到确凿的指认。干警察这行，要让一老太太从一排嫌疑人中指认出六个月前她站在窗前看到跑来跑去的那一个，也当然太他妈荒唐了。虽然我们可以把清晰的照片拿给酒店员工看，可他们还是确定不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, here we are with a guy who ducks out and has fifteen grand in his pants and folks know it. Well, that's money. I might duck out myself, if I had fifteen grand, and me with two kids in high school. So the first thought is somebody rolls him for it and rolls him too hard, so they have to take him out in the desert and plant him among the cactuses. But I don't like that too well. Regan carried a gat and had plenty of experience using it, and not just in a greasy-faced liquor mob. I understand he commanded a whole brigade in the Irish troubles back in 1922 or whenever it was. A guy like that wouldn't be white meat to a heister. Then, his car being in that garage makes whoever rolled him know he was sweet on Eddie Mars' wife, which he was, I guess, but it ain't something every poolroom bum would know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我们现在讨论的是个离家出走的家伙，他口袋里装了一万五千块，大家都看在眼里。嗯，那可不是小数目。要是我有一万五千块，没准我也开溜；我还有两个念中学的孩子呢。所以第一反应就是有人要抢钱，不过抢他的钱太难，他们只好把他带到沙漠里，让他置身于仙人掌中。但我觉得这不是太说得通。里根带着手枪，操起枪来也驾轻就熟，之前一起混的也不仅仅是群脸上油腻腻的酒贩子。据我所知，在1922年还是什么时候的爱尔兰政变中，他手下有整整一支旅。像这样一个人物可不会任一伙强盗宰割。然后，看到他的车停在那间车库里，抢他钱的人就会认为他跟艾迪·马尔斯的老婆有交情，我想事实也确实如此，但这件事并不是随便哪个泡弹子房的小流氓都知道的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Him, not her. That's funny too. There's a lot of funny angles to this case. Here." He pushed a shiny print across the desk and I looked at an Irish face that was more sad than merry and more reserved than brash. Not the face of a tough guy and not the face of a man who could be pushed around much by anybody. Straight dark brows with strong bone under them. A forehead wide rather than high, a mat of dark clustering hair, a thin short nose, a wide mouth. A chin that had strong lines but was small for the mouth. A face that looked a little taut, the face of a man who would move fast and play for keeps. I passed the print back. I would know that face, if I saw it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有里根的照片。这点也很古怪。这案子有不少古怪的地方。给。”他把一张亮闪闪的照片推过桌面，我看到一张爱尔兰脸庞，那张脸上的忧伤多过欢喜，眉宇间透着拘谨而非莽撞。那既不是一张硬汉的脸，也不像是属于一个会被任何人轻易呼来喝去的人。挺拔的深色眉毛，眉骨粗壮。额头与其说高峻不如说宽阔，成簇成簇的深色头发，又短又细的鼻子，一张大嘴。下巴的线条很强健，不过对于嘴巴来说小了点。一张看起来有点紧张的脸，拥有这样一张脸的人想必行动迅捷，动起手来不会闹着玩。我把照片还给他。以后要是看到这张脸，我认得出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Captain Gregory shook his head. "If he's smart enough to get by in his racket, he's too smart for that. I get your idea. He pulls the dumb play because he thinks we wouldn't expect him to pull the dumb play. From a police angle that's wrong. Because he'd have us in his hair so much it would interfere with his business. You might think a dumb play would be smart. I might think so. The rank and file wouldn't. They'd make his life miserable. I've ruled it out. If I'm wrong, you can prove it on me and I'll eat my chair cushion. Till then I'm leaving Eddie in the clear. Jealousy is a bad motive for his type. Top-flight racketeers have business brains. They learn to do things that are good policy and let their personal feelings take care of themselves. I'm leaving that out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格里高利上尉摇摇头。“如果他聪明得可以顺顺当当开赌场，绝不会傻到干这个。我懂你的意思。他装傻，故意出昏招，因为他觉得我们想不到他会那样。从警方的角度看，这是错误的。因为那样他会引来我们的反复查问，生意就做不成了。你大概认为那是高明的一招。没准我也会这么认为。但普通大众不会。他们的眼光会让他活得很苦。我已经排除这种可能了。你要是能证明我说得不对，我就把椅垫给吃了。在那之前，艾迪在我们这就是清白的。对他这类人来说，妒忌是很糟糕的杀人动机。一流的骗子都是懂生意经的。他们做事懂得讲究好策略，不会受个人情感的影响。所以这种可能性我不予考虑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. Eddie must of had some, but he won't loosen up. He wants her let alone. I can't make him. He's got friends in town, or he wouldn't be what he is." He grunted. "Any of this do you any good?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。艾迪一定有几张，可他不愿拿出来。他不想惊动她。我没法逼他。他城里有朋友，不然他也成不了现在的他。”他嘟囔道，“这里头有没有你用得上的信息？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We've done all we could, brother. If he wants to put out a reward and spend some money, we might get results. The city don't give me the kind of money it takes." His large eyes peered at me and his scratchy eyebrows moved. "You serious about thinking Eddie put them both down?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“能做的我们都已经做了，老兄。要是他肯发布悬赏，花上点钱，我们也许能获得些成果。市政收入不少，可我们没有相应的经费。”他的大眼睛凝视着我，他稀疏的眉毛动了动。“你当真觉得艾迪把他俩都杀了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I laughed. "No. I was just kidding. I think what you think, Captain. That Regan ran away with a woman who meant more to him than a rich wife he didn't get along with. Besides, she isn't rich yet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我笑了。“没有。我开玩笑罢了。我跟你想得一样，上尉。里根同一个女人私奔了，对他而言，那女人要比一个合不来的有钱妻子重要。再说了，她现在还没钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He grunted and I thanked him for his time and information and left. A gray Plymouth sedan tailed me away from the City Hall. I gave it a chance to catch up with me on a quiet street. It refused the offer, so I shook it off and went about my business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他咕哝了一声，我为占用的时间和得到的信息向他道了谢，离开了。开出市政厅挺远，一辆灰色普利茅斯轿车盯了上来。我拐进一条安静的街道，给它机会赶上来。它没领我的好意，于是我甩开它，去忙自己的事了。">查看中文翻译</div>
