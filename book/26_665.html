<div class="line_en">I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora's little bed was empty; and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist.</div>

<div class="line_en">I dashed at the place in which I had left her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: I perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it. She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink bare feet and the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave, and I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach. "You naughty: where HAVE you been?" Instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair -- feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我冲了过去，我走时她还躺在那床上（因为小丝绸床单和被褥动过了），白色的窗帘被特意拉到前面。这时，我的脚步声得到了回应，这让我感到无法言说的放松：我发觉百叶窗动了一下，这个孩子低着头，微笑着从另一边走了进来。她率真地站在那里，穿着一件小睡衣，赤裸着一双粉嫩的脚，披着一头金色的卷发。她看上去很严肃，我还从未有过这种失而复得的感受（刚才那阵惊吓实在太可怕了），在我的意识中是她用责备的语气问我：“淘气鬼，你刚去哪里啦？”我并无追问她的反常，而是发现我自己正遭受指责，而且需要解释。她用自己最可爱、最急切的单纯解释了这件事。她在床上躺着的时候，忽然知道我出去了，就起来看我到底有什么事。她的再次出现让我高兴得跌坐在椅子上，我感到有点儿头晕，她快步走了过来，趴在我的膝盖上，整个人被烛光笼罩着，可爱的小脸上仍带着睡意的绯红。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember closing my eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻，在我当时的精神状态下，我确实相信她说谎了。如果我再一次闭上了眼睛，那是因为在我面前有三、四种可以采取的方法，这令人眩晕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my feet, looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way. "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有屈服，而是站了起来，看了一眼她的小床，选择了一个无可奈何的折中办法。“你为什么把窗帘拉上挡住那里，让我以为你还在那儿呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But if I had, by your idea, gone out --?" She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. "Oh, but you know!" she quite adequately answered, "that you might come back, you dear, and that you HAVE!" And after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a long time, by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to prove that I recognized the pertinence of my return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，以你的想法，我是不是已经出去了？”她完全陷入迷惑之中，目光转向蜡烛的火焰，好像这问题跟她无关，或者就像马西特太太或乘法运算一样一点儿也提不起她的兴趣。“哦，但你知道！”她很从容地回答道，“你可能会回来，亲爱的，你已经回来了！”过了一小会儿，她上床睡觉了，我则长时间地坐在她旁边握着她的小手，向她证明我意识到了我回来的重要性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I on no other occasion saw him in the house. I just missed, on the staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我再也没有在那里碰到他，我也可以马上说，我再也没有在那房子里看到他。另一方面，我恰好遗漏了楼梯上所存在的另一个危险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I repeatedly sat up till I didn't know when; I selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept, and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as far as to where I had last met Quint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不断地坐起来，也不知道几点了，我选择在我室友确实睡熟的时候，偷偷地溜出来，静静地拐进过道，甚至走到我上次遇到昆特的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the eleventh night after my latest encounter with that gentleman -- they were all numbered now -- I had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching, I had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at my old hour. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about one o'clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused as if a hand had shook me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我最近那次遇见昆特后的第十一个晚上——现在我都数着天数——我总带着一种危机四伏的警戒，而且的确，出人意料的事实证实了我最强烈的惊慌。确切地说，这是这一段时间中的第一晚，我疲惫地守望着，我不能让自己像过去一样放松警惕。我很快就睡着了，后来才知道，我坚持到一点钟，但我一醒来，就马上坐起身，就好像是有一只手把我摇醒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had been there but an instant, however, when she vanished without looking round at me. I knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face she had to show; and I wondered whether, if instead of being above I had been below, I should have had, for going up, the same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well, there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在那里只站了一会儿，然而，她甚至没转身看我就消失了。尽管如此，我知道她会露出多么可怕的一张脸。我想知道，如果我站在低处，而不是高处，我是否会像遇见昆特那次一样勇敢地迎面而上。是啊，仍然还有很多让人鼓起勇气的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking down it from the top I once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back presented to me, her body half-bowed and her head, in an attitude of woe, in her hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hidden, protected, absorbed, she evidently rested on the sill -- the casement opened forward -- and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to help her, and this fact had counted in my quick decision. She was face to face with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate with it as she had not then been able to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她防御般地，全神贯注地靠着窗台，很隐蔽——窗扉朝前敞开着——她有点儿要放弃自己了。夜空中静静的明月帮助了她，这在我快速判断的头脑中转了一下。她和我们曾在湖边看到的那个幽灵面对面，那时还不能交流，而现在却能了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The child had again got up -- this time blowing out the taper, and had again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the night. That she now saw -- as she had not, I had satisfied myself, the previous time -- was proved to me by the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个孩子又起床了——这次她吹灭了蜡烛，出于某种观察或回应的目的，她又躲在百叶窗后面，窥视着外面茫茫深夜。她现在看起来不像那个过去很让我满意的小姑娘，事实证明，她既不是被我点火柴的光惊醒，也不是被我匆忙穿拖鞋的声响吵醒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What if I should go straight in and march to HIS window? -- What if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my boldness? This thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were secretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which my impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds -- a figure prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我径直走过去，到他的窗口又会怎样呢？如果他以孩子气的惊恐拆穿了我冒险的动机，我就要因为冒失而让这悬而未决的秘密离我越来越远了，那该如何是好？这个想法让我不敢轻易跨过迈尔斯房间的门槛，我在那里又停了下来。我努力地听里面的动静，在心里揣测会有什么凶兆，我想知道是否他的床也是空的，他也在偷偷地注视着一切。这是一个万籁俱寂的时刻，最后，我的这种冲动失败了。他很安静，他可能是无辜的，这种冒险太可怕了，我转身走开了。院子里有人——他在游走，寻找着什么，这个访客应该是与弗洛拉打过交道，但他好像跟我的迈尔斯无关。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While I stood in the passage I had my eyes on her brother's door, which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably, produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of as my temptation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one -- though high above the gardens -- in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by Mrs. Grose in exemplary order, been occupied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我突然想起了那间低些的屋子——尽管高耸于花园之上——就是我曾提到过的那个房子拐角处的塔楼。这是一个巨大的、方形的房间，在一定的情况下曾被安排为卧室，但它过大的空间使它用起来很不方便，格罗斯太太下了警戒性的命令，不许占用，因此已经多年没有用过它了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hesitated afresh, but on other grounds and only for a few seconds; then I had made my choice. There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing the right one.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had often admired it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt as quietly as I could one of the shutters. Achieving this transit, I uncovered the glass without a sound and, applying my face to the pane, was able, the darkness without being much less than within, to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过去，我常常对这个地方羡慕不已，而且我也知道怎么进去。我在这个由于废弃而阴暗寒冷的屋子前迟疑了一下，然后尽可能轻地打开一扇百叶窗进去了。到了窗边，我静静地把玻璃露出来，把脸贴到上面，外面一点儿不比里面黑，看得出我找到了正确的方向。然后我看到了更多东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared -- looking, that is, not so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月光穿透了整个黑夜，也使我看到草坪上有一个人，因为距离远有点儿模糊，他一动也不动地站在那里，似乎被什么吸引住了，正往我出现的地方看——并不是直冲着我看，很显然是在看我上面的什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
