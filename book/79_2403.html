<div class="line_en">The place was about as long as a freight car, and about as high. It smelled of grease and oil and gasoline and -- faint, nostalgic smell-sweet grass. Four power lawnmowers were ranked like soldiers on review against the south wall, two of them the riding type that look like small tractors. To their left were posthole diggers, round-bladed shovels made for doing surgery on the putting green, a chain saw, the electric hedge-clippers, and a long thin steel pole with a red flag at the top. Caddy, fetch my ball in under ten seconds and there's a quarter in it for you. Yes, sir.</div>

<div class="line_en">Against the eastern wall, where the morning sun slanted in most strongly, three Ping-Pong tables leaned one against the other like a drunken house of cards. Their nets had been removed and flopped down from the shelf above. In the corner was a stack of shuffleboard weights and a roque set -- the wickets banded together with twists of wire, the brightly painted balls in an egg-carton sort of thing (strange hens you have up here, Watson… yes, and you should see the animals down on the front lawn, ha-ha), and the mallets, two sets of them, standing in their racks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometime after midnight, while they all slept uneasily, the snow had stopped after dumping a fresh eight inches on the old crust. The clouds had broken, a fresh wind had swept them away, and now Jack stood in a dusty ingot of sunlight, which slanted through the dirty window set into the eastern side of the equipment shed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fragments of his dream (it was all jumbled now, fading) recurred, something about George Hatfield and his father's cane, just enough to make him uneasy and, absurdly enough, a trifle guilty about holding a plain old garden-variety roque mallet. Not that roque was such a common garden-variety game anymore; its more modern cousin, croquet, was much more popular now… and a child's version of the game at that. Roque, however… that must have been quite a game. Jack had found a mildewed rule book down in the basement, from one of the years in the early twenties when a North American Roque Tournament had been held at the Overlook. Quite a game.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梦里的情景已经乱成了一团糟，而且逐渐模糊了，但其中的片断又浮现出来——乔治·哈特菲尔德和老托兰斯的手杖——杰克因此感到很不自在，更荒唐的是，他竟因为手里握着一把平淡无奇的旧短柄木槌而生出了些许的负罪感。短柄槌球已经失去了昔日的荣光，它的更现代化的堂兄弟——槌球戏——现在要流行得多…还有儿童们玩的一个变种。不过，短柄槌球也风光过。杰克在地下室见到过一本发霉的规则手册，是20世纪初的某年远望饭店主办北美短柄槌球锦标赛时留下的。真是——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked over to them, stepping over an old eight-cell battery (which had once sat beneath the hood of the hotel truck, no doubt) and a battery charger and a pair of J. C.

He slipped one of the short-handled mallets out of the front rack and held it up in front of his face, like a knight bound for battle saluting his king.</div>

<div class="line_en">The snowmobile sat almost in the middle of the equipment shed, a fairly new one, and Jack didn't care for its looks at all. Bombardier Skidoo was written on the side of the engine cowling facing him in black letters which had been raked backward, presumably to connote speed. The protruding skis were also black.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪地车差不多恰好蹲在工具棚的正中间，很新，杰克一点儿也不喜欢它的样子。发动机整流罩面向杰克这一侧上写着一排黑字：雪橇投弹手。字体向后倾斜，意在表示风驰电掣般的速度。向上突起的滑橇也是黑色的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他皱了皱眉，然后笑了。是的，这是一项类似精神分裂症的运动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was black piping to the right and left of the cowling, what they would call racing stripes on a sports car. But the actual paintjob was a bright, sneering yellow, and that was what he didn't like about it. Sitting there in its shaft of morning sun, yellow body and black piping, black skis and black upholstered open cockpit, it looked like a monstrous mechanized wasp. When it was running it would sound like that too. Whining and buzzing and ready to sting. But then, what else should it look like? It wasn't flying under false colors, at least. Because after it had done its job, they were going to be hurting plenty. All of them. By spring the Torrance family would be hurting so badly that what those wasps had done to Danny's hand would look like a mother's kisses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整流罩左右两侧刷上了黑色的箭纹，但是，车身却漆成了藐视一切的鲜黄色，这也是杰克不喜欢它的地方。雪地车沐浴在早晨的阳光里，黄色的车身，黑色的条纹，黑色的滑橇和黑色的敞门驾驶室，整个看上去就像一只硕大无朋的机械黄蜂。它的发动机的声音一定很像蜂鸣，嗡嗡嗡，随时准备攻击。但是，它还有那么一点不像黄蜂，至少，它没有披着伪装色到处飞。另外，它完成自己的使命后，他们一家都会大伤元气的，他们每个人。来年春天，托兰斯一家的惨状将使黄蜂在丹尼身上的所做所为相形见绌——只算得上妈妈的亲吻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He swung the mallet through the air… whhhoooop. He smiled a little at the powerful, whistling sound it made. Then he replaced it in the rack and turned to his left. What he saw there made him frown again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用力一挥…呼——，木槌发出了强有力的尖啸声，他不易察觉地笑了笑。然后将木槌放回架子上，转而向左边走去。进入他眼帘的那样东西又让他皱起了眉头。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had always disliked the goddam snowmobiles. They shivered the cathedral silence of winter into a million rattling fragments.</div>

He stood looking down at it, the frown very deep now, and stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket. Outside a sudden gust of wind slammed against the equipment shed, making it rock and creak. He looked out the window and saw the gust carrying a sheet of sparkling snow crystals toward the drifted -- in rear of the hotel, whirling them high into the hard blue sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从后裤袋里抽出手帕揩了揩嘴巴，然后来到雪地车旁边。他站在那儿低头看着它，紧锁眉头，把手帕又塞回到口袋里。外面，一阵猛烈的狂风打在工具棚上，工具棚摇晃着，吱扭着。他往窗外看去，看见狂风卷着一大片晶莹闪亮的雪粉，高高地旋入眩目的蓝天，向埋在积雪中的饭店背后飞去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He began to whistle "Red River Valley" uptempo as he poked along the last two or three feet of shelf. The notes came out in little puffs of white smoke. He had made a complete circuit of the shed and the thing wasn't there. Maybe somebody had lifted it. Maybe Watson had. He laughed aloud. The old office bootleg trick. A few paperclips, a couple of reams of paper, nobody will miss this tablecloth or this Golden Regal place setting… and what about this fine snowmobile battery? Yes, that might come in handy. Toss it in the sack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="架子只剩最后两三英尺未翻到时，他轻快地吹起了《红河谷》的曲子，每个音符离开嘴唇就变成了一小团白雾。他已经把工具棚翻了个遍，就是找不着那玩意儿。也许有人顺手牵羊了，也许是沃森干的。他大笑一声，老一套的损公肥私的鬼把戏。几颗回形针，一两令纸，谁也不会忘记这张桌布或那套“金皇家”餐具…这个不错的雪地车电瓶怎么样？是的，迟早会有用的。把它扔进麻袋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back to the shelves. This time he couldn't find what he wanted, a small battery. A three or four cell. There were socket wrenches, a case filled with drills and drillbits, bags of lawn fertilizer and Vigoro for the flower beds, but no snowmobile battery. It didn't bother him in the slightest. In fact, it made him feel glad. He was relieved. I did my best, Captain, but I could not get through. That's fine, son. I'm going to put you in for the Silver Star and the Purple Snowmobile.

<div class="line_en">In those few seconds he understood everything. There was a certain black-and-white picture he remembered seeing as a child, in catechism class. The nun had presented it to them on an easel and called it a miracle of God. The class had looked at it blankly, seeing nothing but a jumble of whites and blacks, senseless and patternless. Then one of the children in the third row had gasped, "It's Jesus!" and that child had gone home with a brand-new Testament and also a calendar because he had been first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="短短的几秒钟里，他明白了一切。他想起了小时候在教义问答课上，看到的一幅黑白图画。一位修女把这幅画在画架上展开，称之为“上帝显灵图”。全班茫然不解地盯着这幅画，除了没有意义、没有图案的一堆杂乱的黑块和白块外，什么也没看到。这时，第三排的一个孩子喘着气叫道：“耶稣！”于是，那孩子抱着一部崭新的《圣约书》和一本日历回家了，因为他是第一名。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The others stared even harder, Jacky Torrance among them. One by one the other kids had given a similar gasp, one little girl transported in near-ecstasy, crying out shrilly: "I see Him! I see Him!" She had also been rewarded with a Testament. At last everyone had seen the face of Jesus in the jumble of blacks and whites except Jacky. He strained harder and harder, scared now, part of him cynically thinking that everyone else was simply putting on to please Sister Beatrice, part of him secretly convinced that he wasn't seeing it because God had decided he was the worst sinner in the class. "Don't you see it, Jacky?" Sister Beatrice had asked him in her sad, sweet manner. I see your tits, he had thought in vicious desperation. He began to shake his head, then faked excitement and said: "Yes, I do! Wow! It is Jesus!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其余的人更加用力地盯着那幅画，杰克·托兰斯也是其中之一。一个接一个地，其他孩子都发出了类似的喘息，有个小女孩在近乎谵狂的状态中改变了叫法，她尖声叫道：“我看见他了！我看见他了！”她也获得了一部《圣约书》的奖赏。最后，除了杰克，每个人都在一堆乱糟糟的黑和自中看见了耶稣的面孔。他越来越费劲地盯着，有些害怕了，他身体里的某个部分愤世嫉俗地想，别的人都在装假来讨好修女比阿特丽斯。他的另一部分暗暗地相信，他之所以看不出，是因为上帝认定他是班里罪孽最重的人。“还没看见吗，杰克？”修女比阿特丽斯惋惜地问他，声音甜甜的。我看见了你的奶头，他恶狠狠地想，十分绝望。于是，他开始摇头晃脑，然后假装兴奋起来，说：“是的，我看见了！哇！耶稣！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And everyone in class had laughed and applauded him, making him feel triumphant, ashamed, and scared. Later, when everyone else had tumbled their way up from the church basement and out onto the street he had lingered behind, looking at the meaningless black-and-white jumble that Sister Beatrice had left on the easel. He hated it. They had all made it up the way he had, even Sister herself. It was a big fake. "Shitfire-hellfire-shitfire," he had whispered under his breath, and as he turned to go he had seen the face of Jesus from the corner of his eye, sad and. wise. He turned back, his heart in his throat. Everything had suddenly clicked into place and he had stared at the picture with fearful wonder, unable to believe he had missed it. The eyes, the zigzag of shadow across the care-worn brow, the fine nose, the compassionate lips. Looking at Jack Torrance. What had only been a meaningless sprawl had suddenly been transformed into a stark black-and-white etching of the face of Christ-Our-Lord.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="班上的人都笑了，为他鼓起掌来，他心里感到美滋滋的，但也有些羞愧、害怕。后来，别的人都离开了教堂地下室，他落在了后面，盯着修女留在画架上的那堆乱糟糟的黑色和白色。他恨它。他们全跟他一样在装假，甚至包括修女本人，这是个大骗局。“狗屎－狗屁－狗屎”，他小声骂道。他转身刚要离开，这时，他眼角的余光看见了耶稣忧伤、睿智的面容。他转过身来，心脏悬到了嗓子眼上。眼前的一切眨眼间又恢复了原状，他满腹狐疑地盯着那幅画，无法相信自己看错了。那双眼睛，那两道悲天悯人的眉毛上“之”字形的阴影，那漂亮的鼻子，那充满慈爱的嘴唇。他看着杰克·托兰斯，刚才还只是毫无意义的涂鸦的东西突然间变成了耶稣基督的面孔的黑白蚀刻画，栩栩如生。">查看中文翻译</div>
