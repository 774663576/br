<div class="line_en">Denry was happy that people talked about the mule as his "latest", and he was happy to be making money. But he wanted more than money. He was always looking for new ideas, exciting things to do -- things which would make sure that he was always the greatest "card" in the Five Towns.</div>

<div class="line_en">He also bought a mule and cart. He said he needed them for his work. He could, of course, collect rents on a bicycle, and a bicycle doesn't eat much, or run away. But Denry wanted a mule. It was a good advertisement for his business.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, a new notice appeared on Denry's door:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，一条新的告示贴在了邓瑞的门上：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Denry's rent-collecting business grew and grew. He had come back from the Llandudno adventure with a thousand pounds. Two years later he had two thousand pounds, and his bank manager spoke to him with great politeness. Denry now rented a small office, and employed an office-boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓瑞的收租业务蒸蒸日上。他从兰迪德诺的那笔生意中赚到了1000英镑。两年后，他的资产已达到2000英镑。他的银行经理跟他说话时毕恭毕敬。邓瑞现在租了一间小办公室，雇了一名勤杂员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many shops in the Five Towns had savings clubs. Every week customers paid a few pence into the club. At Christmas the customers could spend all the money they had paid in. Denry's idea was for a savings club for every shop in the Five Towns. It was a fantastic idea. A poor person could pay just a little money every week, and to make it easier, Denry could come to the house and collect the money. Denry's savings club was special in one very important way. After paying a pound to Denry, someone could spend two pounds in the shops immediately -- although they must then, of course, continue to pay into the club every week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五镇的很多店铺都有存款俱乐部。顾客每周向俱乐部交几个便士，圣诞节时他们便可以花掉他们在俱乐部的全部存款。邓瑞的想法是为五镇的所有店铺建立一个存款俱乐部。这是一个非常棒的想法。穷人只需每周交一点钱，而且为了简化手续，邓瑞可以上门收钱。邓瑞的存款俱乐部有个非常重要的与众不同之处：只要交给邓瑞的钱达到一英镑，便马上可在店里花掉两 英镑——当然，人们必须每周继续往俱乐部交钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Denry needed to make a profit, of course, and his profit would come from the shops. For every six pence spent in a shop, the shop had to pay him one penny. He started by going to Bostocks, the biggest clothes shop in the Five Towns. With Bostocks' name on the list it was easier to find other shops. In two weeks he had nearly a hundred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，邓瑞需要盈利，他的利润来自那些店铺。人们在店里每消费六便士，商店就得付给邓瑞一便士。他从五镇最大的服装店博斯托克斯店开始谈起。名单上一旦有了博斯托克斯店，再找其他店就容易多了。两周后他找到了将近一百家店铺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he needed something to give the club a good start. For twenty-five pounds Denry could put an advertisement on the front page of the Signal, but he preferred free advertisements. Then he had an idea. He could ask the Countess of Chell to be the patron of his club. Hers was the best possible name to have at the top of his letter paper. She was the richest woman in the Five Towns. Some people loved her and some people hated her, but everybody knew her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他需要做点什么好让俱乐部有一个好的开端。邓瑞花25英镑就能在《信报》首页登个广告，但他更喜欢免费的广告。这时他想出个主意。他可以请切尔伯爵夫人做俱乐部的赞助人。她的名字应该是印在他信纸抬头上最好的名字了。她是五镇最富有的女人。有的人爱她，有的人恨她，但所有人都知道她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So one morning he arrived, without his mule, at the home of the Countess of Chell. He had been to Sneyd Hall before; the gardens were open to the people of the Five Towns, and there were often hundreds of people there on Sunday afternoons in summer. But today the gardens were empty.</div>

Jock had disappeared. Denry tried the big doors, but they were all locked. He went back to the door he had used to come into the room. But strangely, that was now locked as well. Then he heard horses outside, and running to a window, he saw the Countess's carriage driving away.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Savings Club was a great success; in fact, it became too successful. The reason was this. When customers had paid in two pounds, they were allowed to spend four pounds in the shops. They did spend four pounds in the shops. And Denry had to pay the shops. Customers were still paying in their five pence and their ten pence -- but that wasn't enough to help Denry. His two thousand pounds in the bank was going very quickly.

Mrs Kemp was the mother of Jock, Denry's old friend and carriage-driver to the Countess. Second: a day or two later, Jock came to visit his mother, and Denry also came to visit. Denry and Jock went for a short walk together. Third: on the afternoon of the opening of the Police Club, the Countess's carriage broke a wheel between Sneyd Hall and Hanbridge, about five kilometres from Hanbridge. Fourth: about five minutes later, Denry drove past in his mule cart, wearing his best clothes. Fifth: as Denry drove past, Jock called out, "Excuse me, sir!" and Denry stopped.
