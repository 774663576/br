In any case, it was senseless of him to send Sophie the cards instead of sending them directly to his daughter. It could not possibly be because he didn't know his own daughter's address. Was it a practical joke? Was he trying to surprise his daughter on her birthday by getting a perfect stranger to play detective and mailman? Was that why she was being given a month's headstart?

<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲坐在那儿想了很久才开始作答。她可以运用她从艾伯特那儿学到的观念吗？她不得不这样做，因为她已经有好几天没有打开宗教知识的教科书了。她一开始作答后，答案仿佛自然而然就从她的笔端流出来一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wrote that we know the moon is not made of green cheese and that there are also craters on the dark side of the moon, that both Socrates and Jesus were sentenced to death, that everybody has to die sooner or later, that the great temples on the Acropolis were built after the Persian wars in the fifth century B. C. and that the most important oracle in ancient Greece was the oracle at Delphi. As examples of what we can only believe, Sophie mentioned the questions of whether or not there is life on other planets, whether God exists or not, whether there is life after death, and whether Jesus was the son of God or merely a wise man. "We can certainly not know where the world came from," she wrote, completing her list. "The universe can be compared to a large rabbit pulled out of a top hat. Philosophers try to climb up one of the fine hairs of the rabbit's fur and stare straight into the eyes of the Great Magician. Whether they will ever succeed is an open question. But if each philosopher climbed onto another one's back, they would get even higher up in the rabbit's fur, and then, in my opinion, there would be some chance they would make it some day. P. S. In the Bible there is something that could have been one of the fine hairs of the rabbit's fur. The hair was called the Tower of Babel, and it was destroyed because the Magician didn't want the tiny human insects to crawl up that high out of the white rabbit he had just created."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她写道：我们可以确定的事包括月亮不是由绿乳酪做成的、月球较黑的那一面也有坑洞、苏格拉底和耶稣基督两人都被判死刑、每一个人都迟早会死、希腊高城宏伟的神殿是在公元前五世纪波斯战争后兴建的，还有古希腊最重要的神论是戴尔菲的神论。至于我们不能确知的事物，苏菲举的例子包括；其他星球上是否有生物存在、世间是否真有上帝、人死后是否还有生命、耶稣是上帝之子或者只是一个聪明人。在举出这些例子后，苏菲写道：“我们当然无法确知这世界从何而来。宇宙就好像是一只被魔术师从帽子里拉出来的大白兔。哲学家努力沿着兔子毛皮中的一根细毛往上爬，希望能一睹伟大魔术师的真面目。虽然他们不一定会成功，但如果所有哲学家都像叠罗汉一般一层一层往上叠，则他们就可以愈接近兔子毛皮的顶端。果真如此，在我认为，有一天他们也许真的可以爬到顶端。P.S：圣经中有一个东西很像是兔子的细毛，那就是巴别塔。这个塔最后被伟大的魔术师摧毁了，因为他不希望这些微不足道的人类爬出他一手创造出的兔子的毛皮。”">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there was the next question: "Indicate some of the factors contributing to a person's philosophy of life." Upbringing and environment were important here. People living at the time of Plato had a different philosophy of life than many people have today because they lived in a different age and a different environment. Another factor was the kind of experience people chose to get themselves. Common sense was not determined by environment. Everybody had that. Maybe one could compare environment and social situation with the conditions that existed deep down in Plato's cave. By using their intelligence individuals can start to drag themselves up from the darkness. But a journey like that requires personal courage. Socrates is a good example of a person who managed to free himself from the prevailing views of his time by his own intelligence. Finally, she wrote: "Nowadays, people of many lands and cultures are being intermingled more and more. Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists may live in the same apartment building. In which case it is more important to accept each other's beliefs than to ask why everyone does not believe the same thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二个问题是：“请说明影响一个人的生活哲学的因素。”苏菲认为教养与环境很重要。生在柏拉图时代的人们所具有的生活哲学与现代人不同，因为他们生活的时代和环境与我们的不同。另外一个因素是人们选择的经验种类。一般常识不是由环境决定的，而是每一个人都具备的。也许我们可以把我们的环境和社会情况与柏拉图的洞穴相比较。一个人若运用他的聪明才智，将可以使自己脱离黑暗。不过这样的路程需要一些勇气，苏格拉底就是一个很好的例子，显示一个人如何运用自己的聪明才智使自己不受当时思想主流的影响。最后，苏菲写道：“在当今这个时代，来自各个地方、各种文化的人们交流日益密切。基督徒、伊斯兰教徒与佛教徒可能住在同一栋公寓中。在这种情况下，接受彼此的信仰要比去问为什么大家不能有一致的信仰更加重要。”">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">She applied herself to the third question: "What is meant by conscience? Do you think conscience is the same for everyone?" This was something they had discussed a lot in class. Sophie wrote: Conscience is people's ability to respond to right and wrong. My personal opinion is that everyone is endowed with this ability, so in other words, conscience is innate. Socrates would have said the same. But just what conscience dictates can vary a lot from one person to the next. One could say that the Sophists had a point here. They thought that right and wrong is something mainly determined by the environment the individual grows up in. Socrates, on the other hand, believed that conscience is the same for everyone. Perhaps both views were right. Even if everybody doesn't feel guilty about showing themselves naked, most people will have a bad conscience if they are really mean to someone. Still, it must be remembered that having a conscience is not the same as using it. Sometimes it looks as if people act quite unscrupulously, but I believe they also have a kind of conscience somewhere, deep down. Just as it seems as if some people have no sense at all, but that's only because they are not using it. P. S. Common sense and conscience can both be compared to a muscle. If you don't use a muscle, it gets weaker and weaker."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，她专心答第三道问题：“良知是什么？你认为每个人都有同样的良知吗？”这个问题他们在课堂上已经讨论过很多次了。苏菲答道：“良知是人们辨别善恶是非的能力。我个人的看法是：‘每一个人天生都具备这种能力。’换句话说，良知是与生俱来的。苏格拉底应该也会持同样的看法。不过良心对人的影响因人而异。在这方面我们可以说诡辩学振的主张不无道理。他们认为是非的观念主要是由个人成长环境决定的。相反的，苏格拉底则相信每一个人的良心都一样。也许这两种观点都没有错。虽然并不是每一个人在大庭广众之下赤身露体时都会感到羞愧，但大多数人在欺负别人后多少都会良心不安。不过，我们也不要忘记，具有良知和运用良知是两回事。有时有些人做起事来一副无耻的模样，但我相信他们内心深处还是有某种良知存在的。就像某些人看起来似乎没有大脑的样子，但这只是因为他们不用脑筋罢了。P.S：常识和良心不像肌肉一样。你不去用它，它就会愈来愈萎缩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not bad, thought Sophie. She certainly felt she had covered some ground with what she had learned from her philosophy teacher. And she could always supplement it with a dash of her own common sense and what she might have read and heard elsewhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，答得不坏！苏菲心想。她觉得自己已经运用她从哲学老师那儿学来的知识答出了一些重点，她只要加上一些自己的常识与她从别处听来或读到的东西就成了。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Now there was only one question left: "What is meant by priority of values?" This was another thing they had discussed a lot lately. For example, it could be of value to drive a car and get quickly from one place to another. But if driving led to deforestation and polluting the natural environment, you were facing a choice of values. After careful consideration Sophie felt she had come to the conclusion that healthy forests and a pure environment were more valuable than getting to work quickly. She gave several more examples. Finally she wrote: "Personally, I think Philosophy is a more important subject than English Grammar. It would therefore be a sensible priority of values to have Philosophy on the timetable and cut down a bit on English lessons."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在只剩下一个问题了：“何谓价值的轻重？”这也是他们最近—时常讨论的一个主题。举例来说，开着车子迅速往来各地也许是很重要的，但如果驾驶车辆会导致森林遭到砍伐、自然环境受到污染等后果，我们就必须要作个选择。在仔细考量之后，苏菲的结论是：维护森林的健康和环境的纯净要比能够节省上班途中的交通时间更有价值。她另外又举了一些例子。最后，她写道：“我个人认为哲学这门课要比英文文法更重要。因此，如果学校能将哲学课列入课程，并且略微减少英文课的时间，他们对价值轻重的判断就是正确的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They drew attention to human fellowship, they were preoccupied with politics, and many of them, notably the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (A. D. 121-180), were active statesmen. They encouraged Greek culture and philosophy in Rome, one of the most distinguished of them being the orator, philosopher, and statesman Cicero (106-43 B. C.). It was he who formed the very concept of "humanism"-- that is, a view of life that has the individual as its central focus. Some years later, the Stoic Seneca (4 B. C.-A. D. 65) said that "to mankind, mankind is holy." This has remained a slogan for humanism ever since.</div>

This meant establishing a clear division between the soul and the body.

This was widely believed by many Greeks long before Plato. Plotinus was also familiar with similar ideas from Asia.</div>

<div class="line_en">The most important figure in Neoplatonism was Plotinus (c. 205-270), who studied philosophy in Alexandria but later settled in Rome. It is interesting to note that he came from Alexandria, the city that had been the central meeting point for Greek philosophy and Oriental mysticism for several centuries. Plotinus brought with him to Rome a doctrine of salvation that was to compete seriously with Christianity when its time came. However, Neoplatonism also became a strong influence in mainstream Christian theology as well.</div>

At the other end is absolute darkness, which receives none of the light from the One. But Plotinus's point is that this darkness actually has no existence. It is simply the absence of light -- in other words, it is not. All that exists is God, or the One, but in the same way that a beam of light grows progressively dimmer and is gradually extinguished, there is somewhere a point that the divine glow cannot reach.</div>

Some mystics call it God, others call it the cosmic spirit, Nature, or the Universe. When the fusion happens, the mystic feels that he is "losing himself"; he disappears into God or is lost in God in the same way that a drop of water loses itself when it merges with the sea. An Indian mystic once expressed it in this way: "When I was, God was not. When God is, I am no more." The Christian mystic Angelus Silesius (1624-1677) put it another way: Every drop becomes the sea when it flows oceanward, just as at last the soul ascends and thus becomes the Lord.</div>
