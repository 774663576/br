<div class="line_en">Noah was sitting in his rocker, drinking sweet tea, listening for the car, when he finally heard it turn up the drive. He went around front and watched the car pull up and park beneath the oak tree again. Same spot as yesterday. Clem barked a greeting at her car door, tail wagging, and he saw Allie wave from inside the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie met him halfway, carrying a small bag in one hand. She surprised him by kissing him gently on the cheek, her free hand lingering at his waist after she pulled back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hi," she said, radiance in her eyes, "where's the surprise?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He relaxed a little, thanking God for that. "Not even a 'Good afternoon' or 'How was your night?'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stepped out, patted Clem on the head while she cooed at her, then turned, smiling at Noah as he walked toward her. She looked more relaxed than yesterday, more confident, and again he felt a slight shock at seeing her. It was different from yesterday, though. Newer feelings now, not simply memories anymore. If anything, his attraction for her had grown stronger overnight, more intense, and it made him feel a little nervous in her presence.</div>

<div class="line_en">She nodded, handing her bag to him, and he jogged to the house and brought it inside, where he placed it on a chair in the living room. Then he grabbed some bread and put it in a bag, bringing it with him as he left the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then we'll go. I don't care if it rains."</div>

<div class="line_en">She thought for a second while she looked around. When she spoke, her voice was determined.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was going to take you someplace, but with those clouds coming in, I'm not sure we should go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He chuckled lightly, then paused. "Allie, I've got some bad news."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fine. Good afternoon. How was your night? And where's the surprise?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you sure?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The storm. We'll be outside and might get wet. Besides, there might be lightning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked at the clouds again, noting their approach. "Then we'd better go now," he said. "Can I bring that in for you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smiled. Patience had never been one of her strongest attributes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Can I do anything?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess I should feel special."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'll see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," he said, "do you remember when we took the canoe out and watched the sun come up?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are special," he finally said, and the way he said it made her wonder if he wanted to add something else. But he didn't, and Allie smiled a little before glancing away. As she did, she felt the wind in her face and noticed it had picked up since the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took a few steps before responding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked to the canoe, Allie beside him. A little closer than yesterday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What exactly is this place?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thought about it this morning. I remember it made me cry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They reached the dock a moment later. After tossing the bag in the canoe, Noah quickly checked to make sure he hadn't missed anything, then slid the canoe to the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What you're going to see today makes what you saw then seem ordinary."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, just get in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're not even going to give me a hint?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After she climbed in, he pushed the canoe farther into the water, close to the dock. Then he gracefully stepped off the dock into the canoe, placing his feet carefully to prevent the canoe from capsizing. Allie was impressed by his agility, knowing that what he had done so quickly and easily was harder than it looked.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Artistic, she thought. There's something almost artistic about him when he does this. Something natural, as if being on the water were beyond his control, part of a gene passed on to him from some obscure hereditary pool. When she watched him, she was reminded of how the early explorers must have looked when they'd first discovered this area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And it was true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie sat at the front of the canoe, facing backward. He had said something about missing the view when he started to paddle, but she'd shaken her head, saying she was fine the way she was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She couldn't think of anyone else who remotely resembled him. He was complicated, almost contradictory in so many ways, yet simple, a strangely erotic combination. On the surface he was a country boy, home from war, and he probably saw himself in those terms. Yet there was so much more to him. Perhaps it was the poetry that made him different, or perhaps it was the values his father had instilled in him, growing up. Either way, he seemed to savor life more fully than others appeared to, and that was what had first attracted her to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She could see everything she really wanted to see if she turned her head, but most of all she wanted to watch Noah. It was him she'd come to see, not the creek. His shirt was unbuttoned at the top, and she could see his chest muscles flex with every stroke. His sleeves were rolled up, too, and she could see the muscles in his arms bulging slightly. His muscles were well developed there from paddling every morning.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">She felt her insides jump just a bit as Noah's voice brought her back to the present. She realized she hadn't said much since they'd started, and she appreciated the silence he had allowed her. He'd always been considerate like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good things," she answered quietly, and she saw in his eyes that he knew she was thinking about him. She liked the fact that he knew it, and she hoped he had been thinking about her as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How much farther?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She understood then that something was stirring within her, as it had so many years ago. Watching him, watching his body move, made her feel it. And as their eyes lingered for a second, she felt the heat in her neck and breasts, and she flushed, turning away before he noticed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you thinking?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A pause. Then, she said: "It's pretty out here. So clean. So quiet. It's almost like going back in time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Another half mile or so. Not any more than that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In a way it is, I think. The creek flows from the forest. There's not a single farm between here and where it starts, and the water is pure as rain. It's probably as pure as it's ever been."</div>

<div class="line_en">She leaned toward him. "Tell me, Noah, what do you remember most from the summer we spent together?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Anything in particular?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He answered after a moment, quietly, seriously. "No, it's not that. It's not what you're thinking. I was serious when I said 'all of it.' I can remember every moment we were together, and in each of them there was something wonderful. I can't really pick any one time that meant more than any other. The entire summer was perfect, the kind of summer everyone should have. How could I pick one moment over another?</div>

<div class="line_en">"You don't remember?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if you planned on falling in love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable, Allie. I didn't mean to. But that summer has stayed with me and probably always will. I know it can't be the same between us, but that doesn't change the way I felt about you then."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It didn't make me uncomfortable, Noah… It's just that I don't ever hear things like that. What you said was beautiful. It takes a poet to talk the way you do, and like I said, you're the only poet I've ever met."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie stared at him. No one had ever said anything like that to her before. Ever. She didn't know what to say and stayed silent, her face hot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie noticed it all, every sound, every thought. Her senses had come alive, invigorating her, and she felt her mind drifting through the last few weeks. She thought about the anxiety coming here had caused her. The shock at seeing the article, the sleepless nights, her short temper during daylight. Even yesterday she had been afraid and wanted to run away. The tension was gone now, every bit of it, replaced by something else, and she was glad about that as she rode in silence in the old red canoe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She spoke quietly, feeling warm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peaceful silence descended on them. An osprey cried somewhere in the distance. A mullet splashed near the bank. The paddle moved rhythmically, causing baffles that rocked the boat ever so slightly. The breeze had stopped, and the clouds grew blacker as the canoe moved toward some unknown destination.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a worker's world, not a poet's, and people would have a hard time understanding Noah. America was in full swing now, all the papers said so, and people were rushing forward, leaving behind the horrors of war. She understood the reasons, but they were rushing, like Lon, toward long hours and profits, neglecting the things that brought beauty to the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Who did she know in Raleigh who took time off to fix a house? Or read Whitman or Eliot, finding images in the mind, thoughts of the spirit? Or hunted dawn from the bow of a canoe? These weren't the things that drove society, but she felt they shouldn't be treated as unimportant. They made living worthwhile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She felt strangely satisfied that she'd come, pleased that Noah had turned into the type of man she'd thought he would, pleased that she would live forever with that knowledge. She had seen too many men in the past few years destroyed by war, or time, or even money. It took strength to hold on to inner passion, and Noah had done that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To her it was the same with art, though she had realized it only upon coming here. Or rather, remembered it. She had known it once before, and again she cursed herself for forgetting something as important as creating beauty. Painting was what she was meant to do, she was sure of that now. Her feelings this morning had confirmed it, and she knew that whatever happened, she was going to give it another shot. A fair shot, no matter what anyone said.</div>

<div class="line_en">She shook her head then, knowing she wasn't being completely fair. She loved Lon, and always had, for other reasons. Though he wasn't Noah, Lon was a good man, the kind of man she'd always known she would marry. With Lon there would be no surprises, and there was comfort in knowing what the future would bring. He would be a kind husband to her, and she would be a good wife. She would have a home near friends and family, children, a respectable place in society. It was the kind of life she'd always expected to live, the kind of life she wanted to live. And though she wouldn't describe theirs as a passionate relationship, she had convinced herself long ago that this wasn't necessary to be fulfilled in a relationship, even with a person she intended to marry. Passion would fade in time, and things like companionship and compatibility would take its place. She and Lon had this, and she had assumed this was all she needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Would Lon encourage her painting? She remembered showing him one of her paintings a couple of months after they had first started going out. It was an abstract painting and was meant to inspire thought. In a way, it resembled the painting above Noah's fireplace, the one Noah understood completely, though it may have been a touch less passionate. Lon had stared at it, studied it almost, and then had asked her what it was supposed to be. She hadn't bothered to answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">But now, as she watched Noah rowing, she questioned this basic assumption. He exuded sexuality in everything he did, everything he was, and she caught herself thinking about him in a way that an engaged woman shouldn't. She tried not to stare and glanced away often, but the easy way he moved his body made it hard to keep her eyes from him for long.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here we are," Noah said as he guided the canoe toward some trees near the bank.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Close your eyes," he whispered, and Allie did, bringing her hands to her face. She heard the baffles of the water and felt the movement of the canoe as he propelled it forward, away from the pull of the creek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He guided the canoe around the tree, and both of them had to lower their heads to keep from bumping them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Okay," he finally said after he'd stopped paddling. "You can open them now."</div>
