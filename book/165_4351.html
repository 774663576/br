<div class="line_en">A year before Cheng Xin's awakening, the advance warning system discovered an unknown flying object sweeping past the edge of the Oort Cloud at a speed close to lightspeed. At its closest approach, the object was only 1.3 light-years from the Sun. The object's volume was immense, and at its near-lightspeed velocity, the radiation generated by its impact with the scattered dust and atoms in space was intense. The advance warning system also observed the object making a small course change during flight to avoid a patch of interstellar dust, before resuming its previous course. It was most certainly an intelligent spaceship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Due to lessons learned from the previous three false alarms, the Federation Government did not publicize this discovery. No more than a thousand people in the entire Bunker World knew about it. During the few days when the spaceship had been closest to the Solar System, these individuals lived in extreme anxiety and terror. In the few tens of space observation units comprising the advance warning system, in the advance warning center (a space city in the Jupiter cluster), in the battle center of Federation Fleet Command, and in the office of the president of the Solar System Federation, people held their breaths and watched the spaceship's course like a trembling school of fish hiding at the bottom of a pond, waiting for the trawler to pass overhead. These individuals' terror developed to absurd levels later: They refused to use radio communications, walked noiselessly, and spoke only in whispers… In reality, everyone understood that these gestures were meaningless, not the least because what the advance warning system observed had happened a year and four months ago. By now, the spaceship was already gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于前三次误报警的教训，联邦政府一直没有对外公布这一发现，在掩体世界中，知道这事的不超过一千人。在外星飞船最接近太阳系的那段日子里，这些人都处于极度的紧张和恐俱之中。在太空中的几十个预警系统观测单元里，在太阳系预警中心（现在是海王星群落中一座单独的太空城），在联邦舰队总参谋部作战中心，在太阳系联邦总统的办公室里，人们息声屏气地注视着外星来客的动向，像一群躲在水底瑟瑟发抖的鱼，听着水面的捕捞船驶过。这些知情人的恐惧后来发展到荒唐的地步，他们拒绝使用无线通信，甚至走路都放轻脚步，说话都压低声音……其实，谁都知道这毫无意义，因为预警系统现在看到的，是一年零四个月之前的景象，此时这艘外星飞船已经远去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Further analysis of the observation data revealed that the projectile wasn't aimed precisely at the Sun. According to its current trajectory, it would sweep past the Sun outside the orbit of Mars. If the intended target had been the Sun, this was a relatively gross error. This showed another way that the projectile was different from a photoid: The data gathered from the previous two photoid strikes all showed that after a photoid was launched, it followed a precise, straight trajectory to the target star (taking into account the motion of the star) and did not require any course correction. It could be surmised that a photoid was essentially a rock flying under inertia at lightspeed. Tracking the gravitational wave source showed that the projectile did not make any course corrections, apparently indicating that its target was not the Sun. This provided some comfort for everyone involved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对观测数据的分析还表明，发射体并没有精确地对准太阳，如果按它目前的轨道运行，它将从火星轨道外侧掠过太阳，如果它的目标是太阳的话，这是相当大的误差。这也从另一个方面表明它与光粒不同：在已有的两次对光粒的观测数据中，光粒发射后，在考虑恒星运行的提前量的前提下，都精确对准目标恒星，不需再进行任何修正，可以认为，光粒就是一块以惯性飞行的光速石头。现在对引力波源的精确跟踪表明，发射体并没有进行过任何轨道修正，似乎表明它的目标不是太阳，这也给人们带来了一点安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the extraterrestrial spaceship moved farther away, these individuals did not relax. The advance warning system discovered something else that was worrisome. The strange spaceship did not shoot a photoid at the Sun, but did launch something else. This object was also shot at the Sun at lightspeed, but it produced none of the emissions associated with photoids and was completely invisible electromagnetically. The advance warning system only managed to discover it through gravitational waves. The object continuously emitted weak gravitational waves whose strength and frequency remained constant. The waves clearly carried no message, and were probably the result of some physical characteristic of the projectile. When the advance warning system initially discovered these gravitational waves, the source was thought to be the extraterrestrial spaceship. But they soon found that the source was separate from the spaceship, and it was approaching the Solar System at lightspeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当外星飞船在观测的视野中渐行渐远时，人们并没能够松一口气，因为预警系统又有了一个更令人担忧的发现：外星飞船没有向太阳发射光粒，但发射了另外一个东西。这个物体也是以光速向太阳发射，但丝毫没有产生光粒的碰撞辐射，在所有电磁波段完全不可见，预警系统是通过引力波发现它的。这个物体不间断地发射出微弱的引力波，这种引力波频率和强度都恒定不变，没有搭载任何信息，可能是发射体固有的某种物理性质所致。预警系统在最初探测到这种引力波并定位其发射源时，以为是外星飞船发出的，但很快探测到引力波的发射源与飞船分离，以接近光速的速度飞向太阳系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Both ships were equipped with gravitational wave reception systems and could form a positioning network to determine the location of the transmission source with precision at close range. Since the Broadcast Era, more ships had been built that could transmit and receive gravitational waves. But the design concepts used in these ships were very different from earlier antenna ships. One of the main innovations was separating the gravitational wave antenna from the ship itself so that they formed two independent units. The antenna could then be combined with different ships, and could be replaced after it failed due to decay. Revelation and Alaska were only medium-sized ships, but they had about the same total volumes as large ships because the gravitational wave antennas made up a large portion of their structures. The two ships resembled helium-filled airships of the Common Era: They looked immense, but the effective payload was just the small gondola hanging below the gasbags.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两艘飞船都带有引力波接收系统，可以构成一个定位网络，在近距离上对发射体进行精确定位。广播纪元以来，人类又建造了多艘能够发射和接收引力波的飞船，但在设计理念上有很大差别，主要是把引力波天线与飞船分开，成为两个独立的部分，天线可以与不同的飞船组合，天线在衰变失效后可以更换。“启示”号和“阿拉斯”号只是两艘中型飞船，但体积与大型飞船相当，主要部分就是巨大的引力波天线。这两艘飞船很像公元世纪的氦气飞艇，看上去很庞大，但有效载荷部分只是挂在气囊下的那一小块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the projectile was about 150 AU from the Sun, the gravitational waves it emitted began to rapidly decrease in frequency. The advance warning system discovered that this was due to its deceleration. Within a few days, the projectile's velocity went from lightspeed to one-thousandth of lightspeed, and continued to decrease. Such low speed meant that it wasn't enough to threaten the Sun, which provided further comfort. In addition, at this speed, human spacecraft could keep up with it. In other words, it was possible to send out ships to intercept it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接近距太阳一百五十个天文单位时，发射体的引力波频率开始迅速降低，预警系统很快发现，这是发射体减速造成的。在几天的时间里，它的速度由光速急剧降低到光速的千分之一，而且还在继续降低中。这么低的速度对太阳不会构成威胁，这又是一个安慰，同时，在这个速度上，人类的太空飞行器可以与它并行飞行，就是说，可以出动飞船拦截它了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Alexei Vasilenko had been an observer in the advance warning system during the Broadcast Era. Together with Widnall, he had discovered the trails of the Trisolaran lightspeed ships, which led to the first false alarm. After the incident, Sublieutenant Vasilenko was made one of the scapegoats and was dishonorably discharged. But he thought the punishment unjust and hoped that history would ultimately clear his name, and thus entered hibernation. As time passed, the discovery of the lightspeed trails grew in importance, and the damage from the first false alarm was gradually forgotten. Vasilenko awakened in Year 9 of the Bunker Era, was restored to his former rank, and by now had been promoted to vice admiral of the Solar Federation Space Force. However, he was close to eighty years of age. As he looked at Bai Ice strolling next to him, he thought how unfair life was: This man had been born eighty years before himself and came from the Crisis Era; yet, after hibernation, he was just over forty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bai Ice's original name was Bai Aisi. After awakening, he wanted to appear more integrated and not so behind the times, and chose a more common modern name that mixed English and Chinese elements. He had been a doctoral student under Ding Yi and had gone into hibernation near the end of the Crisis Era, awakening only twenty-two years ago. Usually, such a long leap across the years meant the hibernator would have trouble catching up to the new age, but theoretical physics was a special case. The sophon lock meant that Common Era physicists could still be considered professionally relevant during the Deterrence Era, and the creation of the circumsolar particle accelerator upended all the assumptions of fundamental theoretical physics, as though a deck of cards had been reshuffled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back during the Common Era, superstring theory had been thought of as advanced theory, the physics of the twenty-second century. The creation of the circumsolar particle accelerator allowed superstring theory to be confirmed via experiments. The result, however, was disastrous. Concepts that had to be rejected far outnumbered predictions that were confirmed. Many results that the Trisolarans had passed on were falsified. Based on the high level of technology the Trisolarans were later able to achieve, it was inconceivable that they had made such mistakes in fundamental theory. The only conclusion was that they had lied to humans even in the areas of basic theory.</div>

<div class="line_en">This resonated with Vasilenko. He looked back along the ship's course. Neptune was only a tiny blue dot and the Sun a faint spot of light, incapable of even casting their shadows against the antenna surface. Where were the two thousand stellar-class warships that had formed a magnificent phalanx all those years ago? Now, there were just these two lonely ships with a complement of no more than a hundred crew. Alaska was about a hundred thousand kilometers away but not visible to them. That ship wasn't only acting as the other end of the positioning network, but also held another exploratory team organized the same as the team aboard Revelation. Fleet Command called the team aboard Alaska the backup, indicating that the brass had made ample preparations for the risk and danger inherent in this expedition. Here, at the cold, desolate frontier of the Solar System, the antenna under their feet seemed a lonesome island in the universe. Vasilenko wanted to sigh, but thought better of it. He took something out of the pocket of his spacesuit and let it float between the two of them, spinning slowly.</div>

He let it go, and the component continued to spin slowly, as though moved by some soul embedded within. Bai Ice moved his eyes away and gazed into the distance.

<div class="line_en">Faced with this paper slip -- that was what they all called it -- everyone heaved a sigh of relief. Rationally, they were still guarded. The object could certainly be a weapon that possessed enough power to destroy both spaceships. But it was impossible to believe that it could threaten the entire Solar System. By appearance, it was delicate, harmless, like a white feather floating in night air. People had long ceased to write letters on paper, but they were familiar with the concept from period films about the ancient world, and so the paper slip seemed almost romantic in their eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so, Revelation slowly sailed toward the paper slip, made contact, and then allowed it to enter the ship. Even more slowly, it adjusted its position until the slip hung in the middle of the laboratory cabin. The only way to move the slip during study was to move the ship itself. This odd way to manipulate the research subject posed some challenges near the beginning, but luckily, Revelation was originally designed to investigate small space objects in the Kuiper Belt and possessed excellent maneuverability. The gravitational wave antenna was equipped with twelve high-precision thrusters. After the ship's AI grew used to the necessary adjustments, the manipulation became quick and precise. If the world could not affect the slip in any way, the only solution was to let the world surround the slip and move about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside the spaceship, due to the stronger background light, the transparency of the slip became more obvious. It now no longer resembled a slip of paper, but some transparent film that only indicated its presence by the faint light it emitted. People continued to refer to it as a paper slip, however.

<div class="line_en">The first thing the researchers tried to do was to ascertain the slip's mass. The only applicable method was to measure the gravity it generated.

<div class="line_en">On the plane two thousand kilometers away, the light emitted by the two-dimensionalized pinnace and crewmen had already gone out. Compared to collapsing from four dimensions to three, the fall from three dimensions to two gave off much less energy. Two two-dimensional structures were revealed clearly by the starlight. On the two-dimensionalized pinnace, it was possible to see the details of three-dimensional structures unfolded in two dimensions -- the crew cabin, the fusion reactor, and so on -- as well as the curled-up figure of the crewman in the cabin. In the figure of the other crewman, the bones and blood vessels could be clearly discerned, as well as all the body parts. During the process of falling into two dimensions, every point on a three-dimensional object was projected onto the plane in accordance with precise geometric principles, and so these two figures turned out to be the most complete and precise images of the original three-dimensional pinnace and people. All the internal structures were now laid out side by side in two dimensions with nothing hidden. The projection process, however, was very different from that used in engineering drawings, and so it was difficult to visually reimagine the shapes' original three-dimensional structure. The greatest difference from engineering drawings lay in the fact that the two-dimensional unfolding occurred at every scale: All the original three-dimensional structures and details were laid out in parallel in two dimensions, and the result replicated, in some measure, the effect of viewing the three-dimensional world from four-dimensional space. This closely resembled drawings of fractals: No matter how much you zoomed in on a part of the image, it would get no less complex. However, fractals were theoretical concepts -- actual representations were inevitably limited by the resolution, and after zooming in a number of times, the images lost their fractal nature. The complexity of the two-dimensionalized three-dimensional objects, on the other hand, was real: The resolution was at the level of fundamental particles. On the monitoring terminal of Revelation, the eye could only see a limited resolution, but the complexity and number of details already made the viewers dizzy. This was the universe's most complicated image; staring at it for too long would drive one mad.</div>
