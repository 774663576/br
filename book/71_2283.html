<div class="line_en">M. Bertuccio had outdone himself in the good taste shown in the choice of furnishings and in the speed of fitting the house out. Like the Duc d'Antin, who once had a row of trees cut down overnight because King Louis XIV had complained that they interrupted the view, so in three days M. Bertuccio had had an empty courtyard entirely planted, while fine poplars and sycamores, transplanted with their huge mass of roots, gave shelter to the façade of the house in front of which, instead of stones half overgrown with grass, there was a lawn: the turves had been laid that very morning to make a vast carpet still glistening with the water that had been sprinkled over it.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first sight, on the outside, the house in Auteuil had none of the splendour one would expect from a dwelling intended for the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo. But this simplicity was consistent with the master's wishes: he had given strict instructions that nothing was to be changed on the outside, and one had only to consider the inside to understand why: the door was hardly open before the scene changed utterly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿都尔村那座房子的外表，初初一看，并不见有什么富丽堂皇之处，想不到这会是那豪华的基督山伯爵的别墅。但这种朴素的情调是符合屋主的心意的，他曾确确实实地吩咐过，不许外表有任何改变，这一点，只要一看房子的内部，谁都会立刻明白。的确，大门一开，情景就改变了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The orders for all this had come from the count. He had given Bertuccio a plan on which he had marked the number and position of the trees that needed planting, and the shape and extent of the lawn that was to take the place of the stone yard. Now that the work was done, the house had become unrecognizable and Bertuccio himself claimed that he could no longer recognize it, nestling as it was into its setting of greenery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于其余的一切，伯爵也都有过明确的吩咐；他亲自画了一个图样给伯都西奥，标明每一棵树的地点以及那条代替石子路的青草走道的长短宽狭。所以这座房子已完全改了样。伯都西奥都说他几乎认不得它了，因为它的四周都已环绕着树木。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While he was about it, the steward would have liked to make some changes in the garden, but the count had expressly forbidden him to alter anything. Bertuccio made up for the disappointment by filling the antechambers, stairways and mantelpieces with flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="管家本来并不反对把花园也修整一番，但伯爵已明确地关照过，花园里的东西碰都不许碰，所以伯都西奥只能把他的气力用到另一方面，使候见室里、楼梯上和壁炉架上都堆满了花，还有一点是最能显出主人学识渊博、指挥有方、管家办事得力的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In all, this house, which had been empty for twenty-five years and only the day before had been dark and gloomy, impregnated with what might be called the aroma of time, had in a single day recovered an appearance of life, full of the master's favourite perfumes and even his preferred amount of daylight: nothing could better have illustrated the steward's skill and his master's understanding -- the first, in what was needed to serve, the latter in what was needed to be served. When he came in, the count found his books and his weapons to hand, and his favourite paintings before his eyes. In the antechambers were the dogs it pleased him to stroke and the birds it pleased him to hear sing. Like the Sleeping Beauty's castle, the whole house had been awakened from its long sleep and come to life; it sang and blossomed like one of those houses that we have long cherished and in which, when we are unfortunate enough to leave them, we involuntarily relinquish a part of our souls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就是：这座闲置了二十年的房子，在前一天晚上还是这样凄冷阴沉，充满着令人闻之作恶的气味，几乎使人觉得好象能嗅到年深日久的气息，在第二天，它获得了生气勃勃的面目，散发出屋主人所喜爱的芳香，充满了合他心意的光线。当伯爵到来的时候，他一伸手就可以摸到他的书和武器；他的眼光可以停留在他心爱的图画上；他所怜爱的狗会摇头摆尾地在前厅欢迎他；歌声悦耳的小鸟会用它们的乐曲来使他高兴；于是，这座从长眠中醒过来的房子，就象树林里睡美人的宫殿似的顿时活跃起来，鸟儿歌唱，花儿盛开，象是那些我们曾流连过许久，当不得不离开的时候，竟会把我们灵魂的一部分遗留在那里的房子一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Servants were coming and going joyfully in the superb courtyard: some belonged to the kitchens and they were gliding along the corridors as if they had always inhabited this place, or up staircases that had been restored only the day before; others were stationed in the coachhouse, where the different sets of harness, numbered and stored, seemed to have been here for fifty years, and the stables, where the horses in their stalls neighed in answer to their grooms, who spoke to them with more respect than many servants use in addressing their masters.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the other side of the house, corresponding to the library, was the conservatory, full of rare plants blooming in wide Japanese pots.

<div class="line_en">The grand Bertuccio had only left one room alone. This was the bedroom in the left corner on the first floor, reached by the main staircase but also containing the entrance to the secret stairway into the garden.

<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo got down in the courtyard, then looked around the house and the garden in silence, giving no sign of either approval or disapproval. However, when he came into his bedroom, which was opposite the locked room, he pointed to the drawer of a little rosewood table that he had picked out on his first visit. "That can only be for gloves," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"In fact, here they are." At that very moment, a coupé with a steaming team, then two panting saddle-horses, stopped in front of the gate, which opened to let them in. The coupé drove around and stopped at the foot of the steps, followed by the riders. In a moment, Debray had dismounted and was standing beside the carriage door. He offered the baroness his hand and she, as she stepped down, made a movement that anyone except Monte Cristo would have failed to notice. But the count missed nothing, and he saw, in Mme Danglars' palm, the flash of a little white paper, no more visible than the movement of the hand that held it, which passed between Mme Danglars and the minister's secretary with an ease that suggested the manoeuvre was well practised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧！他们来啦！”这时，两匹鼻子里喷着气的马拖着一辆马车，由两位骑在马上的绅士陪伴着，驰到那敞开着的大门口。马车一直赶到阶沿前面方停住，后面跟着那两位马上的绅士。狄布雷的脚一点地，他就已经站在车门前面。他伸手给男爵夫人，男爵夫人就扶着他的手下车，她扶手时的态度有点特别，但这只有基督山才觉察到。真的，什么都逃不过伯爵的眼睛。他注意到一张小字条从邓格拉司夫人的手里塞进部长的秘书手里，塞得极其安闲熟练，证明这个动作是常常实习的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know, but I heard that an emperor of China had a kiln specially built and in it, one after another, they fired twelve pots like this. Two broke in the heat of the fire. The ten remaining ones were sunk three hundred fathoms under the sea. The sea knew what was expected of her: she wrapped her weeds around them, built her corals on them and encrusted them with shells. For two hundred years this decoration was cemented in place at these unheard-of depths, because a revolution overthrew the emperor who thought of the experiment and left only the record of the firing of the pots and their immersion at the bottom of the sea. After two hundred years, this document was discovered and a plan made to recover the vases. Divers were sent down, in specially made engines, to search the bay where the pots had been deposited. Out of the ten, only three were found, the others having been scattered and broken by the waves. I love these vases. Sometimes I imagine that in their depths shapeless, terrifying, mysterious monsters, like those that only divers see, have fastened their cold, flat and astonished eyes, and myriads of fish have slept, finding a refuge from their enemies."</div>
