<div class="line_en">There are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them. Such sentiments -- for the half-credences of which I speak have never the full force of thought -- are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the affair at once from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie. Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in with his humor; and, continuing to occupy our chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we gave the Future to the winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present, weaving the dull world around us into dreams.</div>

<div class="line_en">When, in an article entitled "The Murders in the Rue Morgue," I endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable features in the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, it did not occur to me that I should ever resume the subject. This depicting of character constituted my design; and this design was fulfilled in the train of circumstances brought to instance Dupin's idiosyncrasy. I might have adduced other examples, but I should have proven no more. Late events, however, in their surprising development, have startled me into some farther details, which will carry with them the air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have lately heard, it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in regard to what I both heard and saw so long ago.</div>

<div class="line_en">But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted. It may readily be supposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama at the Rue Morgue, had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the Parisian police. With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown into a household word. The simple character of those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the Prefect, or to any other individual than myself, of course it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous, or that the Chevalier's analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition. His frankness would have led him to disabuse every inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased. It thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of the policial eyes; and the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services at the Prefecture. One of the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named Marie Rogêt.</div>

<div class="line_en">This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue Morgue. Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate "cigar-girl," was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Rogêt. The father had died during the child's infancy, and from the period of his death, until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée; Madame there keeping a pension, assisted by Marie. Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting that neighborhood. Monsieur Le Blanc was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair Marie in his perfumery; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl, although with somewhat more of hesitation by Madame.</div>

<div class="line_en">The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly grisette. She had been in his employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown into confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop. Monsieur Le Blanc was unable to account for her absence, and Madame Rogêt was distracted with anxiety and terror. The public papers immediately took up the theme, and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations, when, one fine morning, after the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health, but with a somewhat saddened air, made her re-appearance at her usual counter in the perfumery. All inquiry, except that of a private character, was of course immediately hushed. Monsieur Le Blanc professed total ignorance, as before. Marie, with Madame, replied to all questions, that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the country. Thus the affair died away, and was generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer, and sought the shelter of her mother's residence in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée.</div>

<div class="line_en">The atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evident that murder had been committed,) the youth and beauty of the victim, and, above all, her previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians. I can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect. For several weeks, in the discussion of this one absorbing theme, even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten. The Prefect made unusual exertions; and the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to the utmost extent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这显然是一起谋杀，由于此案的残暴性质，由于受害人的年轻美貌，特别是她以前的名气，敏感的巴黎人不禁对此案极感兴趣。我真想不起来有哪件类似的事情曾产生过如此广泛的强烈影响。人们一连好几星期都谈论着这个热门话题。警察局对此案特别卖力，巴黎的全部警力当然发挥到最大的程度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. In the mean time the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased. At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several serious émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs "for the conviction of the assassin," or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated, "for the conviction of any one of the assassins." In the proclamation setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture. The entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light. But although, in one or two instances, arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith. Strange as it may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind, reached the ears of Dupin and myself. Engaged in researches which had absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad, or received a visiter, or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers. The first intelligence of the murder was brought us by G --, in person. He called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18 —, and remained with us until late in the night. He had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins. His reputation -- so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air -- was at stake. Even his honor was concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin, and made him a direct, and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative.</div>

<div class="line_en">The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether provisional. This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in possession. He discoursed much, and beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away. Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment of respectful attention. He wore spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occasional glance beneath their green glasses, sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the departure of the Prefect.</div>

<div class="line_en">Marie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, about nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, June the twenty-second, 18 —. In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques St. Eustache, and to him only, of her intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes. The Rue des Drômes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct course possible, from the pension of Madame Rogêt. St. Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at the pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to have escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt's, (as she had done under similar circumstances before,) he did not think it necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on, Madame Rogêt (who was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age,) was heard to express a fear "that she should never see Marie again;" but this observation attracted little attention at the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des Drômes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city, and its environs. It was not, however, until the fourth day from the period of her disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. On this day, (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June,) a Monsieur Beauvais, who, with a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barrière du Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen, who had found it floating in the river. Upon seeing the body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the perfumery-girl. His friend recognized it more promptly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了星期一，才知道姑娘根本没去德罗姆街。一天过去，仍无她的音讯，于是大家各处寻找。到她失踪的第四天，才有了她的确切下落。那天，即6月25日星期三，一个名叫博韦的先生同一个朋友一起去圣安德烈区河对岸的圆木门一带寻找玛丽，在圆木门他们听说塞纳河上渔夫发现水中漂着个女尸。拖到河边，博韦先生一看尸体，就认定这是“香水女郎”。而他的朋友第一眼就将死者认出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the mouth. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned. There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue. About the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers. The arms were bent over on the chest and were rigid. The right hand was clenched; the left partially open. On the left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution. A part of the right wrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more especially at the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the excoriations had been effected by this. The flesh of the neck was much swollen. There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect of blows. A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay just under the left ear. This alone would have sufficed to produce death. The medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased. She had been subjected, it said, to brutal violence. The corpse was in such condition when found, that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition by friends.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered. In the outer garment, a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist, but not torn off. It was wound three times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back. The dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out -- torn very evenly and with great care. It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot. Over this muslin slip and the slip of lace, the strings of a bonnet were attached; the bonnet being appended. The knot by which the strings of the bonnet were fastened, was not a lady's, but a slip or sailor's knot.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the Morgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted.

<div class="line_en">"Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother's house on Sunday morning, June the twenty-second, 18 —, with the ostensible purpose of going to see her aunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Drômes. From that hour, nobody is proved to have seen her. There is no trace or tidings of her at all. There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who saw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother's door. Now, though we have no evidence that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof that, up to that hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière du Roule. This was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was thrown into the river within three hours after she left her mother's house, only three days from the time she left her home -- three days to an hour. But it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight. Those who are guilty of such horrid crimes, choose darkness rather than light. Thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of Marie Rogêt, it could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at the outside. All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again, if let alone. Now, we ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature? If the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead two days. And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="18XX年6月22日星期天早晨，罗杰小姐离开母亲家，说是到德罗姆街去看姑妈，或别的亲戚。从此以后，再没人看到她了，她踪迹全无。到目前为止，尚无人声明在她离开母亲家后还见到过她。我们没有证据说6月22日星期天上午9点钟以后玛丽·罗杰仍在人世，不过我们却有证据可以说，直到那天上午9点钟她还活着。星期三中午12点，圆木门附近的河岸处漂浮一具女尸。如果假设玛丽·罗杰离开母亲家三小时即被人抛入河中，那么从她离家到尸体出现，也只有三天——三天还差一个小时。但是如果玛丽果真惨遭杀身之祸，那么认为凶手动手很早，得以在午夜前将尸首抛入河中，是讲不通的。杀人犯通常选择月黑风高行凶，不会在光天化日动手。推而论之，如果河中女尸确系玛丽·罗杰，那么死尸在水中也只泡了两天半，充其量不过三天。经验证明，溺水者之尸体，或者暴力致死后立即抛入水中的尸体，需要六至十天才会严重腐烂而浮出水面。即使用一门大炮轰击一具浸在水中不足五六天的尸体，强迫使其浮出，事过之后，它也会重新沉下。因此我们不禁要问，在此案中，是什么力量使尸体违反自然规则，提前浮出水面呢？如果死者遇害，尸体一直放在岸边，一直放到星期二晚上才扔下水，那么在岸上就可以发现凶手的痕迹。此外，即使是人死两天后扔下水，尸体也未必那么快就浮上来。何况，如果是桩凶杀案，杀人凶手也太蠢了些，抛尸时居然不系重物。在当时系重物本是一件举手之劳的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals were arrested and discharged. St. Eustache fell especially under suspicion; and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home. Subsequently, however, he submitted to Monsieur G --, affidavits, accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. As time passed and no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated, and journalists busied themselves in suggestions. Among these, the one which attracted the most notice, was the idea that Marie Rogêt still lived -- that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages which embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal translations from L'Etoile, a paper conducted, in general, with much ability.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has no doubt the body was that of Marie Rogêt? He ripped up the gown sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. The public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars. He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it -- something as indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined -- as little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve. M. Beauvais did not return that night, but sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening, that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. If we allow that Madame Rogêt, from her age and grief, could not go over, (which is allowing a great deal,) there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie. Nobody went over. There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, that reached even the occupants of the same building. M. St. Eustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her mother's house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it. For an item of news like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，博韦先生根据什么事实确信那就是玛丽·罗杰的尸体呢？他一撕开衣袖，就说发现记号，证明死者是玛丽。大家普遍认为，他所说的“记号”一定是疤痕之类的东西。其实他只摸了摸死者的胳膊，摸到了上面的汗毛——这也有点太玄了。博韦先生当天晚上没有回来，7点钟才捎话给罗杰太太，她女儿案子仍在调查之中。退一步说，罗杰太太上了年纪，悲伤过度，无法亲临现场，当尸体辨明是玛丽的时，也总该有个亲朋好友去现场了解一下验尸情况。可是竟没人出这个头。圣安德烈街好象什么事都没发生一样，就连寓居在罗杰太太家的房客都一点消息也没听到。玛丽的未婚夫圣尤斯达西先生也是房客之一，他供称，直到第二天早上博韦先生到他房里，他才知道找到了尸体。人命关天的大事，大家竟这样淡漠侍之，真使我们惊讶。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. Its insinuations amount to this: -- that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and that these friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death. But L'Etoile was again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty; that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending the examination at the disinterment. Moreover, although it was stated by L'Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public expense -- that an advantageous offer of private sepulture was absolutely declined by the family -- and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial: -- although, I say, all this was asserted by L'Etoile in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey -- yet all this was satisfactorily disproved. In a subsequent number of the paper, an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor says:</div>

<div class="line_en">By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon Beauvais. A visiter at his office, a few days prior to the girl's disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a rose in the key-hole of the door, and the name "Marie " inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand.</div>

Beauvais, who was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and that she, Madame B., must not say anything to the gendarme until he returned, but let the matter be for him. In the present posture of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head. A single step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais; for, go which way you will, you run against him. For some reason, he determined that nobody shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so far as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule. It is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew her. It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out. It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or to the Rue des Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother's door, and there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the murder had been committed at the Barrière du Roule, there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement. The fact that the body was found floating near the Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water. A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们认为，侦查工作已误入歧途，因为侦查目标始终是河对岸的圆木门荒郊。玛丽是一个大众认识的女子，所以如果她走过三个街区，就不会没人看到她。不论是谁，只要是看到她，就会记住她，因为每个认识她的人都对她感兴趣。她离家出门，正是街上人多时。……若是她跑到圆木门或德罗姆街，一路至少有十几个人认出她来。但是，至今尚无人呈报说她出门后见过她，而且除了有关人士提供的“他说她要出门”的证词外，再没有一样证据证明她确实外出了。她的衣服被撕破，缠在身上，又打了结，这样一来，尸体就成了一个可以拎提的包裹。如果凶杀确实发生在圆木门荒郊，凶手就不必这样做了。尸体的确是在圆木门一带的水面上发现的，但这并不足以证明凶手是在那里弃尸的。……凶手将这个可怜姑娘的裙子撕下70公分长、30公分宽的一条，绑到她的下巴底下，绕到脑袋后面，可能是为了防止她喊叫。由此看来，凶手是没有带手帕的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least, the chief portion of Le Commerciel's argument. Two small boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barrière du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name "Marie Rogêt." Fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared. Madame Deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the river, opposite the Barrière du Roule. The neighborhood is secluded -- particularly so. It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards from the city, who cross the river in boats. About three o'clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied by a young man of dark complexion. The two remained here for some time. On their departure, they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity. Madame Deluc's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative. A scarf was particularly noticed. Soon after the departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and re-crossed the river as if in great haste.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紧接着这个重大发现后，又出现了新证据，德吕克太太称，她在离河岸不远的地方开了一个路边小酒馆，正对圆木门荒郊。那一带人迹罕至，十分荒凉。一到星期天，城里的流氓们就乘船过河，来此胡闹。在出事的那个星期天的下午3点来钟，一个年轻姑娘和一个皮肤黝黑的青年来到酒馆。他俩在这儿待了一会儿．就顺着小路往密林的方向走去。姑娘身上的衣服引起了德吕克太太的注意，她特别注意到了那条围巾。两人走后不久，就来了一群流氓。他们大吃大喝，吵吵闹闹，吃完了一抹嘴，连钱都不付就顺着那对青年男女所走的路走去，他们快天黑了才回来，匆匆地过河离去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain, and stuck together from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them. The silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened. The pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not the hem. They looked like strips torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from the ground. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered."</div>

It appears that, immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described, the lifeless, or nearly lifeless body of St. Eustache, Marie's betrothed, was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage. A phial labelled "laudanum," and emptied, was found near him. His breath gave evidence of the poison. He died without speaking.

An omnibus-driver, Valence, now also testified that he saw Marie Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in question, in company with a young man of dark complexion.

<div class="line_en">"I need scarcely tell you," said Dupin, as he finished the perusal of my notes, "that this is a far more intricate case than that of the Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect. This is an ordinary, although an atrocious instance of crime. There is nothing peculiarly outré about it. You will observe that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should have been considered difficult, of solution. Thus, at first, it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmidons of G -- were able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed. They could picture to their imaginations a mode -- many modes -- and a motive -- many motives; and because it was not impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one, they have taken it for granted that one of them must. But the ease with which these variable fancies were entertained, and the very plausibility which each assumed, should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend elucidation. I have before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the true, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not so much 'what has occurred?' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before?' In the investigations at the house of Madame L'Espanaye, the agents of G -- were discouraged and confounded by that very unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have afforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.</div>

If, dating our inquiries from the body found, and thence tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual than Marie; or, if starting from the living Marie, we find her, yet find her unassassinated -- in either case we lose our labor; since it is Monsieur G -- with whom we have to deal. For our own purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with the Marie Rogêt who is missing.</div>

<div class="line_en">"With the public the arguments of L'Etoile have had weight; and that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subject --'several of the morning papers of the day,' it says,'speak of the conclusive article in Monday's Etoile.' To me, this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its inditer. We should bear in mind that, in general, it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation -- to make a point -- than to further the cause of truth. The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former. The print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion (however well founded this opinion may be) earns for itself no credit with the mob. The mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the epigram which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of merit.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse, that this corpse cannot be that of Marie. The reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at once, an object with the reasoner. In the rash pursuit of this object, he rushes into mere assumption at the outset. 'It is folly to suppose,' he says, 'that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.' We demand at once, and very naturally, why? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed within five minutes after the girl's quitting her mother's house? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period of the day? There have been assassinations at all hours. But, had the murder taken place at any moment between nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, and a quarter before midnight, there would still have been time enough 'to throw the body into the river before midnight.' This assumption, then, amounts precisely to this -- that the murder was not committed on Sunday at all -- and, if we allow L'Etoile to assume this, we may permit it any liberties whatever. The paragraph beginning 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, etc.,' however it appears as printed in L'Etoile, may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the brain of its inditer -- 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on the body, could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight; it is folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same time, (as we are resolved to suppose,) that the body was not thrown in until after midnight' -- a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“作者的第一个目的是要表明，从玛丽失踪到发现浮尸，这中间时间很短，所以尸体不会是玛丽的。于是这位推理者故意将这段时间缩小到最小程度，一开始即作臆测，说：“如果玛丽果真惨遭杀身之祸，那么认为凶手动手很早，得以在午夜前将尸首抛入河中，则是讲不大通的。’咱们自然要问：为什么？认为姑娘离家五分钟后即被杀害，这为什么讲不通？认为谋杀是在那天的某一时间发生的，这为什么讲不通？任何时候都可以有杀人案发生。只要凶杀是在星期天早9点到晚：45之间的任何一刻，凶手就有足够的时间‘在午夜前将尸首抛入河中’。所以，作者的这一臆测等于是这样的：凶杀案根本就不是发生在星期天。如果允许《星报》这样臆测的话，那么便无异于允许它胡猜乱测了。可以想象，撰文者的脑子在根深蒂固地这样想，‘如果玛丽果真惨遭杀身之祸，那么认为凶手动手很早，得在午夜前将尸首抛入河中，则是讲不大通的。而如果同时还认为，午夜之后尸体仍未抛到河里，这也是讲不通的。’——这句话看起来很矛盾，但其实并不如登在报上的那句话那么荒谬。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Were it my purpose," continued Dupin, "merely to make out a case against this passage of L'Etoile's argument, I might safely leave it where it is. It is not, however, with L'Etoile that we have to do, but with the truth. The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated: but it is material that we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have obviously intended, and failed to convey. It was the design of the journalist to say that, at whatever period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was committed, it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight. And herein lies, really, the assumption of which I complain. It is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position, and under such circumstances, that the bearing it to the river became necessary. Now, the assassination might have taken place upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to, at any period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal. You will understand that I suggest nothing here as probable, or as cöincident with my own opinion. My design, so far, has no reference to the facts of the case. I wish merely to caution you against the whole tone of L'Etoile's suggestion, by calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions; having assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it could have been in the water but a very brief time; the journal goes on to say: 'All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.' These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in Paris, with the exception of Le Moniteur. This latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to 'drowned bodies' only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by L'Etoile. But there is something excessively unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of Le Moniteur, to rebut the general assertion of L'Etoile, by a citation of particular instances militating against that assertion. Had it been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three days, these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions to L'Etoile's rule, until such time as the rule itself should be confuted. Admitting the rule, (and this Le Moniteur does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the argument of L'Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three days; and this probability will be in favor of L'Etoile's position until the instances so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“《星报》作者认为，如果尸体是玛丽的，那么它在水中浸泡的时间就非常短暂。这样，他大大缩小了推理范围，使其适合自己需要。他接着又说：‘经过证明，溺水者之尸体，或者暴力致死后立即抛入水中的尸体，需要六至十天才会因严重腐烂而浮上水面。即使用一门大炮轰击一具浸泡在水中不足五六天的尸体，强使其浮出，但事过之后，它又会重新沉下去。’除了《箴言报》外，巴黎的各家报纸都默认了这一观点。而《箴言报》则极力驳斥‘溺水者尸体’这一段，列举了五六个实例来说明溺水者尸体浮起不必用《星报》所说的那么长时间。不过《箴言报》想用几则特殊例子驳倒《星报》的总论点，有点不太聪明。即使它举出的不是五个例子，而是50个尸体两三天就浮出水面的例子，这些例子对《星报》声称的‘自然规则’来说，也只能算是例外。只要承认这一‘自然规则’（《箴言报》没去否定这一‘规则’，只是强调有例外），《星报》的论点就依然十分有说服力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the rationale of the rule. Now the human body, in general, is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from sea. But, leaving this tide out of question, it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh water, of their own accord. Almost any one, falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own -- that is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as possible. The proper position for one who cannot swim, is the upright position of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface. Thus circumstanced, we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion. It is evident, however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate. An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about. Now, in the struggles of one unused to swimming, the arms are invariably thrown upwards, while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position. The result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs. Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them. This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. Such individuals float even after drowning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你一定会马上明白，若想驳倒《星报》论点，首先要驳倒《星报》提出的“自然规则’。因此，必须先讨论讨论这一规则。人的身体与塞纳河的河水比重差不多，既不比河水轻，也不比河水重。也就是说，在正常状态下，一个人身体的浮力，等于其排水量。骨小脂多者的身体，一般比骨大肉瘦者的身体比重轻，女人的身体一般比男人的身体比重轻。河中之水的比重有时是要受海上涌来的潮水的影响的。不过，即使不考虑海水的困素，也还是可以说，在淡水中也极少有谁的身体会沉下去的。落水者差不多都可以浮出水面，只要他肯把自己全部浸于水中，使身体的排水量达到浮起自身的程度。不会游泳者在水中最好采取陆地上走路时的那种直挺挺的姿势：头尽量向后仰，浸于水中，只让鼻子和嘴露出水面。这样一来，准可以毫不费力地漂浮。然而，人体的体重与其排水量很不容易保持平衡，一不小心，其中之一就会超过另一方。比如说，伸出一条胳膊，胳膊失去了水的托浮，变成了额外的重量，头也就随之沉下去了。而如果借助一块小木头的浮力，头就可以完全探出水面，四下张望。不会游泳的人在水中挣扎时，手总是往上举，而头则总想象平常那样直伸着，结果鼻子和嘴都浸入水中。当他在水中挣扎着呼吸时，水就进入了肺里，与此同时大量的水也进入了胃里，胃里和肺里本来都是空气，现在灌满了水，重量就发生了变化，整个身体比以前重了。一般来说，这增加的重量足以使人体沉下去。可是如果是骨小脂多的人，却不致沉下去。所以，这类人即使淹死了，依然会浮在水面上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces. This effect is brought about by decomposition, or otherwise. The result of decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving the puffed appearance which is to (so) horrible. When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. But decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances -- is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death. Thus it is evident that we can assign no period, with any thing like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition. Under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour; under others, it might not take place at all. There are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption; the Bi-chloride of Mercury is one. But, apart from decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation of gas within the stomach, from the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter (or within other cavities from other causes) sufficient to induce a distension which will bring the body to the surface. The effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing; or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue; allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“尸体一旦沉到河底，会一直留在那里，直到由于某种原因，它的比重变得再度轻于水。尸体腐烂会造成这种结果。腐烂会产生气体，气体充满了细胞组织和五脏，使全身呈现可怕的肿胀。随着气体越充越多，尸体的体积也越变越大，但重量却未增加。这样一来它的比重就比水轻了，尸体便浮出水面。但是腐烂是受到各种因素影响的，有的因素使腐烂加快，有的因素使腐烂减缓。季节的冷暖、水的纯度和矿物质的含量、水的深浅和流动状况、尸体本身的体温、死者生前有无疾病，所有这些因素都会影响尸体的腐烂速度。所以，很难准确断定究竟需要多长时间尸体才会因腐烂浮出水面。有时它可能一个钟头就浮出来，有时则可能根本浮不上来、某些化学液体可以使尸体永不腐烂，二氯化汞就是其中之一。然而，除了腐烂之外，胃里的蔬菜等物发酵也会产生气体，别的脏器里可能也会由于这样那样的原因而产生气体，致使尸体因充气而浮出水面。朝尸体放一炮，只会造成一些震动，强使尸体脱开水底松软的泥土，这时其它因素产生的效果就会使尸体浮起来。震动也会消除部分腐烂组织的粘性，使内脏在气体的作用下膨胀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we can easily test by it the assertions of L'Etoile. 'All experience shows,' says this paper, 'that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.' The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence and incoherence. All experience does not show that 'drowned bodies' require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface. Both science and experience show that the period of their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If, moreover, a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon, it will not'sink again if let alone,' until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made between 'drowned bodies,' and 'bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.' Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes them all in the same category. I have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water, and that he would not sink at all, except for the struggles by which he elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath while beneath the surface -- gasps which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs. But these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body 'thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.' Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general rule, would not sink at all -- a fact of which L'Etoile is evidently ignorant. When decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent -- when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones -- then, indeed, but not till then, should we lose sight of the corpse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="把这一问题整个道理弄明白之后，就可以方便地用它来检验《星报》的说法了。它说，‘经验证明，溺水音之尸体，或者暴力致死后立即抛入水中的尸体，需要六至十天才会因严重腐烂而浮出。这段文章现在看来是极为矛盾和不合理的。经验并没有证明“溺水者之尸体’需要六至十天才会因严重腐烂而浮出水面。无论是科学还是经验，都告诉我们，尸体浮出水面的时间无一定规。此外，如果用炮轰击尸体，强使它浮出水面，再不去管它，它也不会重新沉下去’，除非尸体已极度腐烂，尸体里面的气体已经逸出。但是请你注意，‘溺水者之尸体’和‘暴力致死后立即抛入水中的尸体’，二肴是有区别的。文章作者虽然也承认这种区别，但却把二者归为一类。我刚才已经说过溺水之人为什么会比水重。我也说过，一个不会游泳的人，只有当他挣扎把胳膊伸出水面，脑袋在水下呼吸，致使小挤走了肺中的空气，他才会往下沉。但是‘暴力致死后立即抛入水中的尸体，却不会这样地挣扎和呼吸。因此，对于这样的尸体来说，通常的自然规则是，尸体根本不会沉下去。《星报》显然忽略了这一事实。等到尸体极度腐烂的时候，即肉在巨大的压力下脱离了骨头的时候，我们才看不见尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>

Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the reasoner. He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to his theory -- viz: that the body was kept on shore two days, suffering rapid decomposition -- more rapid than if immersed in water. He supposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances it could so have appeared. He is accordingly in haste to show that it was not kept on shore; for, if so,'some trace would be found on shore of the murderers.' I presume you smile at the sequitur.

Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought! No one -- not even L'Etoile -- disputes the murder committed on the body found. The marks of violence are too obvious. It is our reasoner's object merely to show that this body is not Marie's. He wishes to prove that Marie is not assassinated -- not that the corpse was not. Yet his observation proves only the latter point. Here is a corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in, would not have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown in by murderers. This is all which is proved, if any thing is. The question of identity is not even approached, and L'Etoile has been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before.

As his argument is obviously an ex parte one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for had any one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday, the interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his own ratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the grisette. It is, nevertheless, amusing to observe that L'Etoile insists upon its point in the full belief of its furthering its general argument.</div>

In regard to the hair upon the arm, L'Etoile has been obviously disingenuous. M. Beauvais, not being an idiot, could never have urged, in identification of the corpse, simply hair upon its arm. No arm is without hair. The generality of the expression of L'Etoile is a mere perversion of the witness' phraseology. He must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair. It must have been a peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation.</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Her foot,' says the journal, 'was small -- so are thousands of feet. Her garter is no proof whatever -- nor is her shoe -- for shoes and garters are sold in packages. The same may be said of the flowers in her hat. One thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the clasp on the garter found, had been set back to take it in. This amounts to nothing; for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and fit them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try them in the store where they purchase.' Here it is difficult to suppose the reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body of Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference to the question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that his search had been successful. If, in addition to the point of general size and contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly strengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark. If, the feet of Marie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of probability that the body was that of Marie would not be an increase in a ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative. Add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be'sold in packages,' you so far augment the probability as to verge upon the certain. What, of itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes through its corroborative position, proof most sure. Give us, then, flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we seek for nothing farther. If only one flower, we seek for nothing farther -- what then if two or three, or more? Each successive one is multiple evidence -- proof not added to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or thousands. Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the living used, and it is almost folly to proceed. But these garters are found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by Marie, shortly previous to her leaving home. It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt. What L'Etoile says in respect to this abbreviation of the garter's being an usual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error. The elastic nature of the clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation. What is made to adjust itself, must of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely. It must have been by an accident, in its strictest sense, that these garters of Marie needed the tightening described. They alone would have amply established her identity. But it is not that the corpse was found to have the garters of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her bonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the arm, or her general size and appearance -- it is that the corpse had each, and all collectively. Could it be proved that the editor of L'Etoile really entertained a doubt, under the circumstances, there would be no need, in his case, of a commission de lunatico inquirendo. He has thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of the lawyers, who, for the most part, content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts. I would here observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the intellect. For the court, guiding itself by the general principles of evidence -- the recognized and booked principles -- is averse from swerving at particular instances. And this steadfast adherence to principle, with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception, is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth, in any long sequence of time. The practice, in mass, is therefore philosophical; but it is not the less certain that it engenders vast individual error.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“《星报》还说：‘她的脚很小——其实女人的脚都是很小的。她的吊带袜不成为任何证据，鞋子也不成为任何证据，因为吊带袜和鞋子都是市场上成批出售的。她帽子上的假花当然也属于上述情况。博韦先生坚持指出的一件事是，死者吊带袜上的吊钩是翻转过来的，往下移了一些。这其实也说明不了什么问题，因为妇女大都不在商店里试吊带袜，而是买一双回去，如果不合适就再将吊钩调整。’从这段文字中不难看出，作者绝不是在认真推理。如果博韦先生在寻找玛丽尸体时发现一具女尸，这具女尸在体格和外貌上都与失踪的姑娘差不多，那么他不必多考虑死者的穿戴，尽可放心地认为自己已经找到了玛丽的尸体。如果除了体格和外貌相似外，他又在尸体的胳膊上发现了特别的汗毛，与玛丽生前他所看到的汗毛一样，那么他对这一辨认的准确性就更有把握了。汗毛越具特殊性，他的辨认准确性就越大。如果玛丽的脚小，尸体的脚也小，那么死者就是玛丽的这一可能性便又增加了——不仅仅是以算术级增加的。除此之外，再加上死者的鞋子与她那天失踪时所穿的鞋子一样，尽管这种鞋子可能是‘成批出售的’，那么死者是玛丽的可能性就几乎达到了无疑的地步。有些东西本身并不足以作为辨尸证据，但通过它与其它证据相吻合，便构成了确凿的证据。比如说，死者帽子上的花与失踪姑娘帽子上的花是一样的，花儿每增加一朵，证据的可靠性就增加几倍。证据可靠性的增加，不是象做加法那样相加，而是象做乘法那样百千相乘。现在再来看看死者的吊带袜，这双吊带袜同玛丽生前穿的一样，这点倒没什么。但是这双吊带袜的吊钩翻转过来，因此变紧了，而玛丽离家时，她的吊带袜也是吊钩翻转，收紧过的，这一点便变成确凿无疑。《星报》对缩紧吊带袜的解释，只能说明它坚持自己的错误观点而已。吊带袜是有弹性的，翻转吊钩，这本身就不寻常，自身可以变长变短的东西，当然不需要借助外力来调节长短。玛丽用翻转吊钩的方式收紧吊带袜，那准是因为某种偶然的情况。所以，单单吊带袜本身就足以证明死者系玛丽。但是说死者就是玛丽，这并不是因为死者穿有玛丽的吊带袜，或穿有玛丽的鞋子，或戴有玛丽的帽子，或帽子上有玛丽戴的花，也不是因为死者的脚同玛丽的大小相仿，或胳膊上有特殊的记号，或身材与外貌酷似玛丽，而是困为死者具有所有的这些特征，正所谓样样齐全。在这种情况下《星报》的编辑大人还真的怀疑死者就是玛丽，他实在就没必要请律师为证人做心智状态调查了。他认为从律师们的闲谈中拾些牙慧，拉大旗作虎皮，为明智之举。其实，律师们大都是法庭成见的应声虫。我要在此说明，有许多事物虽然不被法庭承认为证据，只要有有识者认可便是最好的证据。因为法庭只讲事物的普遍性，根据已被大家公认并且已成为文字的原则办事，而不讲事物的特殊性，根据特殊的情况来办事。法庭墨守成规的作风，以及不具体事情具体分析的态度，形成了一个固定模式，即：在任何一段相关联的时间中，最大程度地获得可获得的真相。从总体上看，这种模式是明智的。但是在许多单个的案子中，这种模式却会产生错误。">查看中文翻译</div>

He is a busy-body, with much of romance and little of wit. Any one so constituted will readily so conduct himself, upon occasion of real excitement, as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part of the over-acute, or the ill-disposed. M. Beauvais (as it appears from your notes) had some personal interviews with the editor of L'Etoile, and offended him by venturing an opinion that the corpse, notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in sober fact, that of Marie. 'He persists,' says the paper, 'in asserting the corpse to be that of Marie, but cannot give a circumstance, in addition to those which we have commented upon, to make others believe.' Now, without re-adverting to the fact that stronger evidence 'to make others believe,' could never have been adduced, it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood to believe, in a case of this kind, without the ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party. Nothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity. Each man recognizes his neighbor, yet there are few instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his recognition. The editor of L'Etoile had no right to be offended at M. Beauvais' unreasoning belief.</div>

Once adopting the more charitable interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose in the key-hole; the 'Marie' upon the slate; the 'elbowing the male relatives out of the way;' the 'aversion to permitting them to see the body;' the caution given to Madame B --, that she must hold no conversation with the gendarme until his return (Beauvais'); and, lastly, his apparent determination 'that nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except himself.' It seems to me unquestionable that Beauvais was a suitor of Marie's; that she coquetted with him; and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence. I shall say nothing more upon this point; and, as the evidence fully rebuts the assertion of L'Etoile, touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother and other relatives -- an apathy inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the perfumery-girl -- we shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to our perfect satisfaction."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any which have been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from the premises are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two instances, at least, are founded in imperfect observation. Le Commerciel wishes to intimate that Marie was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from her mother's door. 'It is impossible,' it urges, 'that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her.' This is the idea of a man long resident in Paris -- a public man -- and one whose walks to and fro in the city, have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices. He is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own bureau, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he compares his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great difference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in her walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his. This could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying, methodical character, and within the same species of limited region as are his own. He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own. But the walks of Marie may, in general, be supposed discursive. In this particular instance, it will be understood as most probable, that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her accustomed ones. The parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of Le Commerciel would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals' traversing the whole city. In this case, granting the personal acquaintances to be equal, the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal rencounters would be made. For my own part, I should hold it not only as possible, but as very far more than probable, that Marie might have proceeded, at any given period, by any one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt, without meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was known. In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris, and the entire population of Paris itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它的观点比其它报纸的叫喊值得注意得多。它所做的推论是尖锐而又有一定学术性的。但是它所依据的前提在两点不够准确。《商报》想说明，玛丽出家门不远就被一伙流氓劫持。它说：‘玛丽是一个大众都认得的女子，如果她走过三个街区，那么就不会没有人看到她。’这是一个久居巴黎之人所持的观点，他用自己的知名度与这位‘香水女郎’的知名度相比较，于是马上认定，玛丽在街上走同他在街上走一样，会碰上认识的熟人。这种论点若要成立，前提必须是玛丽一定要象那位官员一样在自己特定的熟人多的街区之内。然而玛丽的出门行走，总的来说可能是没有规律的。在她最后一次出门的时候，咱们几乎可以这样说，她走的路线并不是她常走的。《商报》所认为的那种玛丽会象别的名人一样被人认出，这种两个人的完全相似，只有在两个人都横穿全市时才会发生。在这种情况下，如果两个人的熟人相等，那么他们也就有同样的机会遇到同样多的熟人。我个人认为，如果玛丽在某一时候上街，在从她家到她姑妈家的许多路线中拣一条去走，那么她不仅可能，而且大有可能没碰上一个熟人。这类问题应该这样看：即使巴黎最有名的人，他的熟人，在巴黎的总人口中也只是沧海一粟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of Le Commerciel, will be much diminished when we take into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad. 'It was when the streets were full of people,' says Le Commerciel, 'that she went out.' But not so. It was at nine o'clock in the morning. Now at nine o'clock of every morning in the week, with the exception of Sunday, the streets of the city are, it is true, thronged with people. At nine on Sunday, the populace are chiefly within doors preparing for church. No observing person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, from about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath. Between ten and eleven the streets are thronged, but not at so early a period as that designated.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation on the part of Le Commerciel. 'A piece,' it says, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long, and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done, by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.' Whether this idea is, or is not well founded, we will endeavor to see hereafter; but by 'fellows who have no pocket-handkerchiefs' the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians. These, however, are the very description of people who will always be found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts.

Not the least usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events. It is the mal-practice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy. Yet experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant. It is through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely through its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me. The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation.

<div class="line_en">"About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar to the present, was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie Rogêt, from the parfumerie of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais Royal. At the end of a week, however, she re-appeared at her customary comptoir, as well as ever, with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual. It was given out by Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother, that she had merely been on a visit to some friend in the country; and the affair was speedily hushed up. We presume that the present absence is a freak of the same nature, and that, at the expiration of a week, or perhaps of a month, we shall have her among us again." -- Evening Paper -- Monday, June 23.</div>

A gentleman, with his wife and daughter, engaged, about dusk, the services of six young men, who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the Seine, to convey him across the river. Upon reaching the opposite shore, the three passengers stepped out, and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat, when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol. She returned for it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream, gagged, brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her parents.

Let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed. We are now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know that an elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the betrayer's advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual -- we are prepared to regard it as a 'making up' of the old amour, rather than as the commencement of a new one. The chances are ten to one, that he who had once eloped with Marie, would again propose an elopement, rather than that she to whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual, should have them made to her by another. And here let me call your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first ascertained, and the second supposed elopement, is a few months more than the general period of the cruises of our men-of-war.

<div class="line_en">"But if we cannot imagine Madame Rogêt privy to the design of elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl? Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Drômes, and St. Eustache was requested to call for her at dark. Now, at first glance, this fact strongly militates against my suggestion; -- but let us reflect. That she did meet some companion, and proceed with him across the river, reaching the Barrière du Roule at so late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon, is known. But in consenting so to accompany this individual, (for whatever purpose -- to her mother known or unknown, ) she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St. Eustache, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des Drômes, he should find that she had not been there, and when, moreover, upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence from home. She must have thought of these things, I say. She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all. She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we suppose her not intending to return.</div>

Who, then, is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom Marie meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence, that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barrière du Roule?

If I bid St. Eustache call for me at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but, if I wholly neglect to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety. Now, if it were my design to return at all -- if I had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question -- it would not be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will be sure to ascertain that I have played him false -- a fact of which I might keep him for ever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes.

<div class="line_en">"You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion in relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards. Now, the popular opinion, under certain conditions, is not to be disregarded. When arising of itself -- when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner -- we should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius. In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I would abide by its decision. But it is important that we find no palpable traces of suggestion. The opinion must be rigorously the public's own; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain. In the present instance, it appears to me that this 'public opinion,' in respect to a gang, has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts. All Paris is excited by the discovered corpse of Marie, a girl young, beautiful and notorious. This corpse is found, bearing marks of violence, and floating in the river. But it is now made known that, at the very period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased, although less in extent, was perpetuated, by a gang of young ruffians, upon the person of a second young female. Is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown? This judgment awaited direction, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it! Marie, too, was found in the river; and upon this very river was this known outrage committed. The connexion of the two events had about it so much of the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it. But, in fact, the one atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence that the other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so committed. It would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong, there should have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and appliances, engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the same period of time! Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt. That it was the scene, I may or I may not believe -- but there was excellent reason for doubt. Had the true scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested, in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to redivert this attention. And thus, the thicket of the Barrière du Roule having been already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they were found, might have been naturally entertained. There is no real evidence, although Le Soleil so supposes, that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys. 'They were all mildewed down hard,' says Le Soleil, adopting the opinions of its predecessors, 'with the action of the rain, and stuck together from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them. The silk of the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on being opened.' In respect to the grass having 'grown around and over some of them,' it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party. But grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather, (such as was that of the period of the murder,) as much as two or three inches in a single day. A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a week, be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass. And touching that mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously insists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew? Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus, of which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within twenty-four hours?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“尽管新闻界与大众一样，对密林中的这一重大发现喝彩不已，但咱们却极有理由对其表示怀疑。这就是现场，这点我可以相信也可以不相信。如果如《商报》所说，真正的凶手现场在圣安德烈街一带，那么杀人凶手，假如仍在巴黎，自然就会因为大众目光密切注视正确方向而感到胆战心惊。按照一般人的思维方式，凶手会立刻想到必须采取某种行动，转移人们的视线。因此，既然圆木门一带的密林已受到怀疑，凶手自然就会想到把玛丽的遗物放到那儿去，让人发现。虽然《太阳报》认为，密林里的那些物品已放了好长时间了，但它却没有中产够的证据说明这点。许多间接证据表明，从出事的星期天到两个男孩发现它们，这中间整整隔了20天时间，这么长的时间中它们是不可能在那儿而不被人看见的，《太阳报》说：‘这些物品都因雨淋而发了霉，结成了硬硬的霉块。有几件物品的周围长起了草。阳伞的绸伞面质地结实，但是伞里面的丝线却缠在了一起。阳伞是折叠式的，上部已发霉朽烂，一撑开就破了。关于有几件物品的周围长起了草，甚至物品上面也生了草’，这显然是那两个小男孩说的，是他们凭记忆说的，因为他们把这些东西拿回家后才告诉别人。应该想到，凶杀案发生在潮湿炎热的夏季，在这种季节，青草只需一天就可以长两三寸高。而一个星期，草就会长得又密又高，把阳伞完全掩埋，看也看不见。咱们再来说说《太阳报》一再强调的‘发霉’吧，在这段短短的段落里，这位编辑提到的‘霉’字竟有三次之多。莫非他真不懂‘发霉’是怎么回事吗？莫非他没听说过所谓‘霉’，即是一种真菌，而这种真菌的最普通的特性之一就是能在24小时之内迅速成长和凋萎？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule. This thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road. Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool. On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief, were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name, 'Marie Rogêt.' Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around. The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent struggle.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles had been 'for at least three or four weeks' in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact. On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified, for a longer period than a single week -- for a longer period than from one Sunday to the next. Those who know any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion, unless at a great distance from its suburbs. Such a thing as an unexplored, or even an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not for a moment to be imagined. Let any one who, being at heart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis -- let any such one attempt, even during the weekdays, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us. At every second step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards. He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all in vain. Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound -- here are the temples most desecrate. With sickness of the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution. But if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week, how much more so on the Sabbath! It is now especially that, released from the claims of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not through love of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way of escape from the restraints and conventionalities of society. He desires less the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter license of the country. Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of the woods, he indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of his boon companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity -- the joint offspring of liberty and of rum. I say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered, for a longer period -- than from one Sunday to another, in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“于是一眼便可看出，《太阳报》提出这些物品在密林中‘至少有三四个星期’的理由，是站不住脚的。另一方面，实在难以相信这些物品在密林中会超过一个星期，即，从那个星期天到下一个星期天。凡是对巴黎郊区稍有了解的人都知道，除非在很远的远郊，否则要找到一个‘僻静’之处是极为困难的，而要在圆木门树林里找到一个人迹罕至的隐密场所，那根本不可能，连想都不要想。一个热爱大自然，因工作终日束缚在大都市里的人，让这样的一个人去试试看，让他在游人极少的工作日，到近郊那些风景优美的地方去满足自己对幽静的渴望，他一去会不断看到成群的流氓恶少大吵大闹，侵犯人身，于是他便会兴趣全无。他想在密林深处找个没人的去处，但绝不会找到。密林深处成了最肮脏的角落，是最遭玷污的殿堂。这位漫游之人会心中作呕，赶紧返回污染严重的巴黎，仿佛肮脏的都市都比恶人横行的郊区干净几分。然而，既然郊区在游人较少的工作日都这样流氓成群，那么到了节假日则会何等不堪！节假日中，城里的下流人不必上班了，再加上这时城里的人少了，犯罪份子缺少了作案机会，便一窝蜂涌到郊区。他们来郊区并不是想接近美好的大自然，他们来这里是为了逃离社会的种种习惯和束缚。他们渴望的并不是新鲜的空气和翠绿的树木，而是乡村环境给予人的‘放纵’条件。这里，无论是在路边酒馆还是林荫之下，狐朋狗友聚在一起，没有人向他们投来责难的目光，他们可以毫不拘束地狂饮胡闹，尽情享乐，哪怕闹它个昏天黑地也不要紧。我所说的这番话毫无添枝加叶的成份，这种情况许多人都亲眼见过。所以我要再次指出，在这种情况下，上述物品在巴黎近郊的树林中放了至少一个星期，竟没人发现，这实在是奇事一桩！">查看中文翻译</div>

And, first, let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles. Collate this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers. You will find that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications sent to the evening paper. These communications, although various, and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point -- viz., the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its scene. Now here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communications, by the guilty authors of these communications themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This thicket was a singular -- an exceedingly singular one. It was unusually dense. Within its naturally walled enclosure were three extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and footstool. And this thicket, so full of a natural art, was in the immediate vicinity, within a few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the sassafras. Would it be a rash wager -- a wager of one thousand to one -- that a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon its natural throne? Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish nature. I repeat -- it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil, that they were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">"But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged. And, now, let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles. On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf; scattered around, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name, 'Marie Rogêt.' Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not-over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally. But it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons. 'There was evidence,' it is said, 'of a struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,' -- but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. 'The pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended. They looked like strips torn off.' Here, inadvertently, Le Soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase. The pieces, as described, do indeed 'look like strips torn off;' but purposely and by hand. It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is 'torn off,' from any garment such as is now in question, by the agency of a thorn. From the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them, tears them rectangularly -- divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters -- but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece 'torn off.' I never so knew it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from such fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost every case, required. If there be two edges to the fabric -- if, for example, it be a pocket- handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose. But in the present case the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge. To tear a piece from the interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one thorn could accomplish it. But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the other in one. And this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed. If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question. We thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being 'torn off' through the simple agency of 'thorns;' yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn. 'And one part,' too, 'was the hem of the frock!' Another piece was 'part of the skirt, not the hem,' -- that is to say, was torn completely out, through the agency of thorns, from the unedged interior of the dress! These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of reasonable ground for suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of the articles' having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse. You will not have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. There might have been a wrong here, or, more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc's. But, in fact, this is a point of minor importance. We are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the murder. What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly, to bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has, or has not been, the work of a gang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除此之外，我还有其它更有力的理由相信东西是后搁的。现在请你注意这些物品摆放方式中的人为痕迹。状似靠背的石头上放着一条白裙子，状似座位的石头上放着一条丝围巾，地上扔着一柄阳伞、一副手套和一方手帕，手帕上还绣着‘玛丽·罗杰’的名字。这样一种摆放方式肯定是一个不太精明的人，想使‘现场’显得自然搞出的把戏。但是这种摆放其实并不自然。如果这些东西都扔在地上，被人踩过，踏过，那倒更象是真的。在这片狭小的林荫地，经过许多人激烈的搏斗，裙子和丝中竟然还在石头上，这简直不可能。据说，‘土地有践踏的痕迹，矮树枝条都折断了，肯定是搏斗所致。’——但是裙子和丝巾竟然还好好地搁在那儿，就象放在架子上一样。而《太阳报》则说：‘被矮树丛扯下来的布条都是10公分宽20公分长，有一条是上衣的衣襟，缝补过，它们象是扯碎的布条条。’《太阳报》无意中一语道破天机。它说那些碎布‘象是扯碎的布条条’。它们确实是被扯碎的，是用手故意扯碎的。这种质地的衣服，居然被荆棘扯成条，这是极为罕见的。如果是荆棘或钉子钉在衣服里面，会把布撕出三角形的口子，但绝不把布撕成条。这种情况我从未见过，我想你也一样。要想从这样的布料上撕下一条来，需要不同方向两股力量同时用力。如果这块布料两面都有边，比如说象手帕那样，这时候，只有在这种时候，一股力量就足以撕下一条来了。但是现在咱们讲的是一件衣服，它只有一道边。而从衣服中间开撕，则一道边都没有，在这种情况下荆棘是绝对无法把它撕开的。但是，即使有一道边，也需要有两根荆棘，而且布边还得是没缝上的。如果缝上了，那就根本撕不开了。而现在咱们面对的却是，不仅撕下来了，而且还扯成了许许多成条。其中有一条竟是上衣的衣襟！还有一条是从裙子上撕下来的。也就是说，凭着荆棘的力量，把它们从没有边的衣服上完完全全地撕了下来！这很难让人相信。然而，从整件事上来看，这只能算是一处小小的疑点，而更为显著的疑点则是，凶手既然是谨慎地将尸体转移，却如此粗心地对这些物品不管不顾，留在了密林里。我想否定此片密林为杀人现场。这儿有可能发生过犯罪，或者更为可能的是，德吕克太太的酒馆发生了一起事件。然而这一点其实并不怎么重要。咱们现在找的不是犯罪现场，而是要查出谁是杀人凶手。我这繁琐的推论首先是想证明《太阳报》的武断结论是错误的，其次一点，是想让你顺着一条最自然不过的思路去思考，去推理，进一步地去怀疑：这起凶杀案究竟是不是一伙流氓干的。">查看中文翻译</div>

You will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the scene, are applicable, in chief part, only against it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual.

<div class="line_en">"And again. I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in the thicket where discovered. It seems almost impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found. There was sufficient presence of mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse; and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself (whose features might have been quickly obliterated by decay,) is allowed to lie conspicuously in the scene of the outrage -- I allude to the handkerchief with the name of the deceased. If this was accident, it was not the accident of a gang. We can imagine it only the accident of an individual. Let us see. An individual has committed the murder. He is alone with the ghost of the departed. He is appalled by what lies motionless before him. The fury of his passion is over, and there is abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed. His is none of that confidence which the presence of numbers inevitably inspires. He is alone with the dead. He trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse. He bears it to the river, but leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt; for it is difficult, if not impossible to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be easy to return for what is left. But in his toilsome journey to the water his fears redouble within him. The sounds of life encompass his path. A dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer. Even the very lights from the city bewilder him. Yet, in time, and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony, he reaches the river's brink, and disposes of his ghastly charge -- perhaps through the medium of a boat. But now what treasure does the world hold -- what threat of vengeance could it hold out -- which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer over that toilsome and perilous path, to the thicket and its blood-chilling recollections? He returns not, let the consequences be what they may. He could not return if he would. His sole thought is immediate escape. He turns his back forever upon those dreadful shrubberies, and flees as from the wrath to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再有，刚才我已提到现场那些物品的可疑性。罪犯竟然会这么傻，任这些证据留在林子里，等着让人发现。这一事实本身就非常值得怀疑。罪犯偶然把这些证据留在那里，这几乎是不可能的。罪犯想到了要转移尸体，其实尸体经过一段时间的腐烂就会特征消失。而罪犯却把比尸体更能说明问题的证据大大方方地留在现场——我是指绣有死者姓名的手帕。如果说这是一种偶然，那么凶手就绝不会是一伙歹徒了。可以想象，这种偶然性只会发生在单个儿人的身上。咱们来看一看：某人杀了玛丽，林子中只有他和死尸，躺在地上一动不动的尸体令他心惊肉跳，他的一时之气已经消退，头脑冷静下来，恐惧之情自然也油然而生。作案者人多的时候，会互相鼓劲儿，一个个贼胆包天，而凶犯单枪匹马时，就不那么有信心了。他单独守着一具尸体，会浑身发抖，不知所措。然而，尸体无论如何也是要打发掉的。他把尸体背到河边，却把其它犯罪证据留了下来，因为一下子把东西都弄走不仅是困难的，而且是不可能的，再说处理完尸体后回头再拿这些东西也很容易。然而，他费尽力气往河边弄尸体的路上，心里的恐惧也在不断地增加。他总是听见有声响，有十几次，他以为有人在跟着他。甚至市区的灯光都使他疑神疑鬼。他一路上心惊肉跳，走走停停，终于赶到了河边，也许是借助一条小船，处理掉了这具可怕的尸体。此时此刻，想到那冤冤相报的凶兆，即使给凶手再大的甜头，他也不肯重走这条恐惧之路，重温那令人心寒的一切了。他绝不冉回去，他只有一念头：逃之夭夭。他掉转过身，逃离这可怕的灌木丛，生伯报复会降临在自己头上。">查看中文翻译</div>

This was done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to carry the body. But would any number of men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient? To three or four, the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but the best possible hold. The device is that of a single individual; and this brings us to the fact that 'between the thicket and the river, the rails of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it!' But would a number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence, for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted over any fence in an instant?

<div class="line_en">"And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an observation upon which I have already, in some measure, commented. 'A piece,' says this journal, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在此咱们必须回顾一下《商报》上的一番话，这话刚才我已经读过一次。该报说：‘凶手将这个可怜姑娘的裙子撕下70公分长、30公分宽的一条，绑到了她的下巴底下，绕到脑袋后面，凶手这样做可能是为了防止地喊叫。由此看来，凶手是没有带手帕的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a pocket-handkerchief. But it is not to this fact that I now especially advert. That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose imagined by Le Commerciel, that this bandage was employed, is rendered apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket; and that the object was not 'to prevent screams' appears, also, from the bandage having been employed in preference to what would so much better have answered the purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as 'found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.' These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially from those of Le Commerciel. The slip was eighteen inches wide, and therefore, although of muslin, would form a strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally. And thus rumpled it was discovered. My inference is this. The solitary murderer, having borne the corpse, for some distance, (whether from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the bandage hitched around its middle, found the weight, in this mode of procedure, too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the burthen -- the evidence goes to show that it was dragged. With this object in view, it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the extremities. It could be best attached about the neck, where the head would prevent its slipping off. And, now, the murderer bethought him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins. He would have used this, but for its volution about the corpse, the hitch which embarrassed it, and the reflection that it had not been 'torn off' from the garment. It was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat. He tore it, made it fast about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the brink of the river. That this 'bandage,' only attainable with trouble and delay, and but imperfectly answering its purpose -- that this bandage was employed at all, demonstrates that the necessity for its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer attainable -- that is to say, arising, as we have imagined, after quitting the thicket, (if the thicket it was), and on the road between the thicket and the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我刚才说过，十足的下流痞也总是带手帕的。不过，我现在想谈的并不是流氓们带不带手帕的问题。既然已在林子里找到了一块玛丽的手帕，这足以说明事实并非象《商报》所言那样，没有手帕。凶手使用布条，而不使用好用得多的手帕，这也足以说明凶手的目的并不在于‘防止她喊。’。然而警方证词中却说那条麻纱布是‘松松地绕在她的脖子上，打着一个死结’。这句话虽然相当含糊，但却与《商报》所言大有出入。这条布尽管是麻纱质地，但是有30公分宽，叠在一起或搓在一起，也足以成为一条结实的带子。发现尸体时，这条布就是这样搓成一条带子的。我的推论是这样的：这个单个儿作案的凶手把带子系在尸体的腰上，把尸体提了一段距离——也许是从密林中往河边提，也许是从别处。他觉得尸体太重了，这么提不是个办法，于是改为拖拽。证据也已显示，尸体是被拖着走的。要想拖着走，就得在尸体的头上或脚上系上一根绳索之类的东西。而把绳子系在脖子上最好不过，这样一来头可以防止绳索滑脱。于是凶手就一下子想到了尸体腰间的那条布带子。凶手本来是会用这条现成的带子的，可是这条带子在尸体上绕了好几遭，还打了个死结，况且它又是从外衣上撕下来的。凶手一想，从衬裙上另撕一条也很容易。他就这样撕了一条，绑在死者的脖子上，这样把尸体一路拖到河边。凶手之所以使用这条得来费事而又不甚合用的带子，只能说明当时已经没有手帕了，换句话说，这时他已经把尸体弄出密林了（如果密林果真是现场的话），他当时处在密林与塞纳河之间的路上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now this 'great haste' very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes of Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly upon her violated cakes and ale -- cakes and ale for which she might still have entertained a faint hope of compensation. Why, otherwise, since it was about dusk, should she make a point of the haste? It is no cause for wonder, surely, that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to get home, when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm impends, and when night approaches.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I shall add but one to the arguments against a gang; but this one has, to my own understanding at least, a weight altogether irresistible. Under the circumstances of large reward offered, and full pardon to any King's evidence, it is not to be imagined, for a moment, that some member of a gang of low ruffians, or of any body of men, would not long ago have betrayed his accomplices. Each one of a gang so placed, is not so much greedy of reward, or anxious for escape, as fearful of betrayal. He betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed. That the secret has not been divulged, is the very best of proof that it is, in fact, a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are known only to one, or two, living human beings, and to God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我再为‘凶手并非一伙流氓’补充最后一个论据，这个论据在我看来也是最有份量的一个，警方既然已经公布了检举者重赏、自首者特赦的政策，那么这伙全是由下流痞组成的流氓团伙中，就应该有人站出来出卖自己的同谋犯。流氓团伙中的每一个成员，也许并不贪图赏金，也许也并不急于逃命，但却惟恐自己被别人出卖。于是为了避免自己遭人出卖，就先下手为强。赶紧出卖别人。然而，始终未有人站出来泄密，这本身就足以证明，它确实是个秘密。这就是说，世上只有一个人或两个人知道凶杀案的真相，除此之外，只有老天爷心里明白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I say approaches; for the night had not yet arrived. It was only about dusk that the indecent haste of these 'miscreants' offended the sober eyes of Madame Deluc. But we are told that it was upon this very evening that Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, 'heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn.' And in what words does Madame Deluc designate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard? 'It was soon after dark,' she says. But'soon after dark,' is, at least, dark; and 'about dusk' is as certainly daylight. Thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the Barrière du Roule prior to the screams overheard (?) by Madame Deluc. And although, in all the many reports of the evidence, the relative expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just as I have employed them in this conversation with yourself, no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet, been taken by any of the public journals, or by any of the Myrmidons of police.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis. We have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of Madame Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule, by a lover, or at least by an intimate and secret associate of the deceased. This associate is of swarthy complexion. This complexion, the 'hitch' in the bandage, and the'sailor's knot,' with which the bonnet-ribbon is tied, point to a seaman. His companionship with the deceased, a gay, but not an abject young girl, designates him as above the grade of the common sailor. Here the well written and urgent communications to the journals are much in the way of corroboration. The circumstance of the first elopement, as mentioned by Le Mercurie, tends to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the 'naval officer' who is first known to have led the unfortunate into crime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在咱们来把这番冗长的分析归纳一下。咱们分析的结果是凶杀案有两种可能性，一种可能性是凶杀案发生在德吕克太太的小酒馆，另一种可能性是凶杀案发生在圆木门荒郊的密林里。而凶手则是死者的情人，或者至少，是一个暗中与死者关系暖昧的人。此人皮肤黝黑，这种肤色，再加上死者背后的‘扣结’和帽带上的‘水手结’，说明凶手是一个海员。死者是个风流美女，但却不轻浮，此人能与死者交上朋友，足见他不是一名普通的水手。各家报社收到的那些情词恳切的读者来信，也都说明了这点。单从《信使报》报道的第一次私奔来看，咱们很容易产生一种想法：这个海员就是那个最初引诱不幸姑娘的‘海军军官’。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued absence of him of the dark complexion. Let me pause to observe that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was no common swarthiness which constituted the sole point of remembrance, both as regards Valence and Madame Deluc. But why is this man absent? Was he murdered by the gang? If so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl? The scene of the two outrages will naturally be supposed identical. And where is his corpse? The assassins would most probably have disposed of both in the same way. But it may be said that this man lives, and is deterred from making himself known, through dread of being charged with the murder. This consideration might be supposed to operate upon him now -- at this late period -- since it has been given in evidence that he was seen with Marie -- but it would have had no force at the period of the deed. The first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce the outrage, and to aid in identifying the ruffians. This policy would have suggested. He had been seen with the girl. He had crossed the river with her in an open ferry-boat. The denouncing of the assassins would have appeared, even to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving himself from suspicion. We cannot suppose him, on the night of the fatal Sunday, both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage committed. Yet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he would have failed, if alive, in the denouncement of the assassins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而这一点恰恰又使人不禁想起，黑皮肤的此君已经好长时间不露面了。我要在这里插上一句，说说此君的皮肤，他的皮肤不是普通的黝黑，而是黑得足以使瓦朗斯和德吕克太太过目不忘，把这肤色在记忆中留作唯一的特征。可此君为什么不露面了呢？莫非他也被流氓团伙杀害了？如果是这样的话，为什么现场只留下了姑娘的痕迹？如果现场发生两起凶杀，这总应该通过蛛丝马迹看得出来。再说，他的尸体在哪儿？在绝大多数情况下，凶手是会用同样的方法处置同案中的两具尸体的。但是也许有人会说，此君还活着，只是因为怕受到杀人嫌疑，不敢露面。他现在的确可能这样考虑问题，因为证词上说，有人见到他与玛丽在一起。不过这并不能说明就是他杀害玛丽。一个无辜的人对这种事首先想到的应是说明事情的真相，并且协助警方辨识凶手，这是上策中的上策。有人看见他与姑娘在一起，他俩又一道乘敞篷渡船过河，即使是傻瓜也会明白，检举凶手才是开脱自己的最佳方法。在那个出事的星期天晚上，他是不可能自己清白无辜，又不知道发生了这起暴行的。如果现在他仍然活着，那么只有一种情况使他不去报案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And what means are ours, of attaining the truth? We shall find these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed. Let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement. Let us know the full history of 'the officer,' with his present circumstances, and his whereabouts at the precise period of the murder. Let us carefully compare with each other the various communications sent to the evening paper, in which the object was to inculpate a gang. This done, let us compare these communications, both as regards style and MS., with those sent to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais. And, all this done, let us again compare these various communications with the known MSS. of the officer. Let us endeavor to ascertain, by repeated questionings of Madame Deluc and her boys, as well as of the omnibus-driver, Valence, something more of the personal appearance and bearing of the 'man of dark complexion.' Queries, skilfully directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of these parties, information on this particular point (or upon others) -- information which the parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing.

With a proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat; for not only can the bargeman who picked it up identify it, but the rudder is at hand. The rudder of a sail-boat would not have been abandoned, without inquiry, by one altogether at ease in heart. And here let me pause to insinuate a question. There was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat. It was silently taken to the barge-office, and as silently removed. But its owner or employer -- how happened he, at so early a period as Tuesday morning, to be informed, without the agency of advertisement, of the locality of the boat taken up on Monday, unless we imagine some connexion with the navy -- some personal permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute interests -- its petty local news?</div>

<div class="line_en">"In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore, I have already suggested the probability of his availing himself of a boat. Now we are to understand that Marie Rogêt was precipitated from a boat. This would naturally have been the case. The corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore. The peculiar marks on the back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat. That the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the idea. If thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. We can only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off. In the act of consigning the corpse to the water, he would unquestionably have noticed his oversight; but then no remedy would have been at hand. Any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore. Having rid himself of his ghastly charge, the murderer would have hastened to the city. There, at some obscure wharf, he would have leaped on land. But the boat -- would he have secured it? He would have been in too great haste for such things as securing a boat. Moreover, in fastening it to the wharf, he would have felt as if securing evidence against himself. His natural thought would have been to cast from him, as far as possible, all that had held connection with his crime. He would not only have fled from the wharf, but he would not have permitted the boat to remain. Assuredly he would have cast it adrift. Let us pursue our fancies. -- In the morning, the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting -- at a locality, perhaps, which his duty compels him to frequent. The next night, without daring to ask for the rudder, he removes it. Now where is that rudderless boat? Let it be one of our first purposes to discover. With the first glimpse we obtain of it, the dawn of our success shall begin. This boat shall guide us, with a rapidity which will surprise even ourselves, to him who employed it in the midnight of the fatal Sabbath. Corroboration will rise upon corroboration, and the murderer will be traced."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至于那个单个儿作案的凶手把尸体拖往河边嘛，刚才我已经说过他很可能有一条船。现在咱们应该这样认为：玛丽·罗杰是从船上扔下去的。实际情况应该如此。凶手绝不会将尸体扔在岸边的浅水中一走了事。死者背部和肩部的伤痕是船底硌的。尸体上未系重物也证实了这一点。如果凶手在岸边抛尸，肯定会在尸体上系上重物。咱们现在只能推测凶手划船离岸时一时疏然，忘记带重物了。他投尸入水时，当然发现了这一疏忽，但是这时已没有别的法子，手边确实没东西。即使不系重物日后会有很多风险，但也总比返回那倒霉的岸边强。凶手抛下尸体后，就匆匆赶回市区，找了一个僻静的码头，一跃上岸。但是小船呢，他为什么不把它系住？他准是太着急了，来不及系船。再说，他觉得把船拴在码头上，这无异于留下了一份于己不利的证据。他本能地希望，把一切与这桩凶杀有关的东西都扔得越远越好。他不但要逃离码头，而且也不许这条船留在这里。他当然希望它远远地漂走，随波逐流。但第二天早上，这个倒霉蛋惊恐地得知小船已被人拾到，并被拖到了一个他每天都要去的地方——也许是出于工作需要每天都必须去的地方。到了夜里，他把小船偷走，但没胆量去把舵一起找来。现在这条无舵的小船在哪儿呢，这是咱们首先要查明的事情。只要找到了它，胜利就为期不远了。这条小船将会以惊人的速度把咱们引向那个星期天午夜划过它的人。这样一来，证据一环套一环，凶手就无从藏身了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of coincidences. And farther: in what I relate it will be seen that between the fate of the unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as that fate is known, and the fate of one Marie Rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history, there has existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the reason becomes embarrassed. I say all this will be seen. But let it not for a moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative of Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its dénouement the mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert design to hint at an extension of the parallel, or even to suggest that the measures adopted in Paris for the discovery of the assassin of a grisette, or measures founded in any similar ratiocination, would produce any similar result.</div>

<div class="line_en">For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it should be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important miscalculations, by diverting thoroughly the two courses of events; very much as, in arithmetic, an error which, in its own individuality, may be inappreciable, produces, at length, by dint of multiplication at all points of the process, a result enormously at variance with truth. And, in regard to the former branch, we must not fail to hold in view that the very Calculus of Probabilities to which I have referred, forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel: -- forbids it with a positiveness strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been long-drawn and exact. This is one of those anomalous propositions which, seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical, is yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain. Nothing, for example, is more difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by a player at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt. A suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once. It does not appear that the two throws which have been completed, and which lie now absolutely in the Past, can have influence upon the throw which exists only in the Future. The chance for throwing sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary time -- that is to say, subject only to the influence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice. And this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with anything like respectful attention. The error here involved -- a gross error redolent of mischief -- I cannot pretend to expose within the limits assigned me at present; and with the philosophical it needs no exposure. It may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path of Reason through her propensity for seeking truth in detail.</div>
