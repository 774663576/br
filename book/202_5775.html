<div class="line_en">Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys' car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus's top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利跑回楼上自己的卧室，冲到窗前，正好看见德思礼家的汽车拐过车道，上了马路，后座上德达洛的高顶礼帽位于佩妮姨妈和达力中间。汽车到了女贞路尽头往右一拐，车窗在西斜的太阳照耀下射出火一般的红光，然后就不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry picked up Hedwig's cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley's computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart's content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利拎起海德薇的笼子，拿起他的火弩箭和背包，最后扫了一眼整洁得有些反常的卧室，然后歪歪斜斜地下楼来到客厅里，把鸟笼、扫帚和背包放在楼梯脚旁。光线很快变暗，客厅在暮色中显得阴影重重。四下里一片寂静，哈利站在这里，知道自己将要永远离开这所房子，感觉真是特别异样。很久以前，德思礼一家出去玩乐，把他一个人留在家里，那几个小时独处的时光真是一种难得的享受：从冰箱里快速愉些好吃的东西，然后冲到楼上，玩玩达力的电脑，或打开电视，随心所欲地选择频道。想起那些时光，他内心里泛起一种莫名的惆怅，如同想起一个已经失去的小弟弟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't you want to take a last look at the place?" he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. "We'll never be here again. Don't you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories… Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors… Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it?… And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不想最后一次看看这个地方吗？”他问海德薇。猫头鹰仍然把脑袋藏在翅膀底下生闷气。“我们再也不会到这里来了。你不想回忆回忆所有那些快乐的时光吗？我是说，看看门口这块擦鞋垫。想想往事……我把达力从摄魂怪手里救出来后，他在这块垫子上吐了……想不到他还是知道感恩的，你相信吗？……还有去年夏天，邓布利多穿过那道前门……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once -- Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it -- a flying motorbike…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利看看那一堆堆的鞋子和雨伞，想起当年每天早晨醒来，抬眼看着楼梯底侧，那里总会吊着一两只蜘蛛。那些日子，他还对自己的真实身份一无所知，他还没有弄清父母是怎么死的，也不明白为什么经常会有那些奇怪的事情在他周围发生。哈利仍然记得那些当年就纠缠着他的梦境：乱梦颠倒，绿光闪烁，还有一次——哈利说起这个梦时，弗农姨父差点儿撞了车——居然梦见一辆会飞的轻型摩托车……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon's choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，附近什么地方传来震耳欲聋的吼声。哈利猛地直起身子，头顶砰的一声撞在低矮的门框上。他顿了顿，用弗农姨父最喜欢的粗话骂了几句，然后跌跌撞撞地走回厨房，手捂着脑袋，朝窗外的后花园望去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, "All righ", Harry? Ready fer the off?"</div>

Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗似乎泛起了涟漪，空气本身也在颤动。接着，随着幻身咒的失效，一个个人影开始显现出来。最显眼的是海格，他戴着头盔和护目镜，骑在一辆巨大的、带黑色挎斗的轻型摩托车上。在他周围，其他人纷纷从飞天扫帚上下来，还有两个是从瘦骨嶙峋的、带翅膀的黑马身上下来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Change of plan," growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. "Let's get undercover before we talk you through it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“计划变了。”疯眼汉粗声粗气地说，他提着两个鼓鼓囊囊的巨大口袋，那只魔眼嗖嗖地扫视着逐渐变暗的天空、房屋和花园，速度快得令人眩晕，“我们先掩护起来，再跟你细说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia's gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset hound's eyes and matted hair. Harry's heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把他们都领进了厨房，大家嘻嘻哈哈、谈笑风生地坐在椅子上，坐在佩妮姨妈光洁锃亮的厨房操作台上，或靠在她一尘不染的各种器皿上。罗恩，又瘦又高；赫敏，浓密的头发在脑后编成了一根长辫子；弗雷德和乔治，一模一样地咧嘴笑着；比尔，满脸伤痕，留着长发；韦斯莱先生，慈眉善目，秃顶，眼镜戴得有点歪；疯眼汉，久经沙场，只有一条腿，那只亮晶晶的蓝色魔眼在眼窝里嗖嗖地转个不停；唐克斯，一头短发是她最喜欢的显眼的粉红色；卢平，更加憔悴、瘦削；芙蓉，美丽苗条，长长的银白色秀发；金斯莱，秃头，宽肩膀，皮肤黝黑；海格，头发胡子蓬乱茂密，弓着腰站在那里，生怕脑袋撞到天花板；蒙顿格斯·弗莱奇，小个子，邋里邋遢，一副猥琐样，眼皮像短腿猎犬那样耷拉着，头发蓬乱纠结。此情此景，令哈利心花怒放，开心极了：他真喜欢他们大家啊，就连蒙顿格斯他也喜欢上了，而上次见面时，哈利还想掐死他呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right, all right, we'll have time for a cozy catch-up later!" roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. "As Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother's charm does that already. What he's really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，好了，以后有时间好好聊个痛快！”穆迪在一片喧闹声中吼道，厨房里顿时安静下来。穆迪把口袋扔在脚下，转向哈利：“德达洛大概已经跟你说了，我们不得不放弃第一套计划，皮尔斯·辛克尼斯大动干戈，给我们带来了很大麻烦。他把许多做法都归为犯法行为，抓住就要坐牢，比如：让这所房子跟飞路网连接，在这里放一个门钥匙，或者幻影显形进进出出。还说这么做是为了保护你，为了不让神秘人抓住你。纯属无稽之谈，你母亲的咒语已经做到了这点。他所做的实际上是阻止你安全地离开这里。">查看中文翻译</div>

If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“踪丝，踪丝！”疯眼汉不耐烦地说，“探测十七岁以下的巫师进行魔法活动的符咒，魔法部通过它来发现未成年都使用魔法！如果你，或者你周围的什么人，念一个咒语让你离开这里，辛克尼斯就会知道，食死徒也会知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你母亲的符咒在两种条件下会破除：你成年了，或者——”穆迪指了指一尘不染的厨房“——你不再管这个地方叫家。今晚，你和你的姨妈姨父分道扬镳，彼此都明白你们今后再也不会共同生活了，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The one thing we've got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn't know we're moving you tonight. We've leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you're not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we're dealing with, so we can't just rely on him getting the date wrong; he's bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we've given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we're going to hide you, they've all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley's place, Molly's Auntie Muriel's -- you get the idea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们有一个优势，就是神秘人不知道我们今晚要来转移你。我们给魔法部透露了一个假情报：他们以为你30号才会离开。不过，我们的对手是神秘人，光指望他把日子搞错是不够的；他肯定会让两个食死徒在这个地区的上空巡视，以防万一。所以，我们对整整一打房屋采取了最好的保护措施。它们看上去都像是我们准备藏你的地方，都和凤凰社有某种联系：我的房子、金斯莱家、莫丽的穆丽尔姨妈【从这时候开始，我们才知道穆丽尔是莫丽的姨妈，孩子们的姨婆，本册原著第八章中第一次出现Great—Aunt Muriel这个词】家——你明白这意思吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So this time, when you leave, there'll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We're choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.</div>

Potter, if we're lucky he'll have swallowed the fake bait and he'll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he'd be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it's what I'd do. They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother's charm holds, but it's about to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can't split himself into seven."</div>
