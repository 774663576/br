<div class="line_en">In place of that relaxed atmosphere of life and good cheer that seems to be, so to speak, exhaled by a firm enjoying prosperity; in place of the happy faces looking out of the windows and the busy clerks hurrying down the corridors with pens behind their ears; in place of the courtyard full of boxes, resounding to the shouts and laughter of the delivery men; in place of all this, from the moment he came in, he would have found an indefinable air of sadness and death. The corridor was empty, the courtyard deserted; and, of all the many employees who had once crowded into the offices, only two remained: the first was a young man, aged about twenty-three or twenty-four, named Emmanuel Herbault, who was in love with M. Morrel's daughter and had stayed with the firm despite his relatives' efforts to extricate him; while the other was an old cashier, one-eyed, nicknamed Coclès by the young people who had once populated this vast, busy hive which was now almost uninhabited, a label that had now so completely and utterly replaced any previous ones, that in all probability he would not even have turned around if someone were to have called him by his true name.</div>

<div class="line_en">Coclès had remained in M. Morrel's service, and the good man's situation had changed in a rather unusual way: he had simultaneously risen to the rank of cashier and fallen to that of a house servant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柯克莱斯依旧还在摩莱尔先生手下服务，他的地位起了一种最奇特的变化。一方面他被升为出纳员的职位，而同时却又降低到一个仆役的身份。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was still the same Coclès for all that, kind, patient and devoted, but immovable when it came to arithmetic, the only point on which he would have challenged the whole world, even M. Morrel, knowing nothing beyond his Pythagorean tables, but having these at his fingertips, whichever way one chose to turn them or however one tried to lure him into error.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，他还是那过去的柯克莱斯，善良，忠心，不怕麻烦，但在数学问题上却绝不屈服，他在这一点上，会坚决地站起来和全世界抗争，甚至和摩莱尔先生抗争；他又长于九九乘法表，把它背得滚瓜烂熟，不论设什么诡计圈套去考问他，总难他不倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the midst of the general depression that had settled over the firm of Morrel and Son, Coclès was the only one who had remained impassive. There should be no mistake: this impassivity was not due to any lack of feeling, but on the contrary to an unshakeable faith. We have mentioned that the host of clerks and employees who owed their livelihood to the shipowner's firm had gradually deserted the office and the shop, like the rats which, so they say, gradually leave a ship when it has been preordained by fate to perish at sea, with the result that these self-interested guests have entirely abandoned it by the time it sets sail. Coclès had watched all of them depart without even thinking to enquire into the cause of their departure. Everything for Coclès came down to a matter of numbers and, in the twenty years that he had worked for Morrel's, he had always seen payments go through without hindrance and with such regularity that he could no more accept an end to that regularity or a suspension of those payments, than a miller whose wheel is turned by the waters of a plentiful stream would accept that the same stream might cease to flow. Indeed, nothing so far had threatened Coclès' confidence. The previous month's payments had gone through with absolute punctuality. Coclès had noted an error of seventy centimes which M. Morrel had made to his own detriment and, the same day, brought the excess fourteen sous to M. Morrel, who took them with a melancholy smile and dropped them into an almost empty drawer, saying: "Coclès, Coclès, you are a jewel among cashiers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在摩莱尔父子公司的日趋窘困的过程中，只有他一个人毫不动摇。这倒并不是出于一种情感，却相反的是出于一种坚定的信念。据说一艘命中注定要在海洋里覆没的船，船上的老鼠会预先溜走，临到那艘船起锚的时候，这些自私的乘客都已逃得精光，也正是象这样，摩莱尔父子公司所有这许多职员也一个个的脱离了办公厅和货仓。柯克莱斯眼看着他们离开，但对于离开的原因却连问都不问。我们已经说过，一切在他看来只是一个数学问题。二十年来，他看到所有的付款总都是正确地如期付清，所以在他看来，如说公司有一天竟会付不出款，似乎是不可能的，正如一个磨坊老板不能相信那一向日夜推动他的磨机的河水竟会一旦不流一样。目前还不曾发生过什么事情可以动摇柯克莱斯的信仰。上个月的付款是极其正确地如期付清了的。柯克莱斯查出一笔有损于摩莱尔的十四个苏的错账，当天晚上，他把那十四个铜板交给摩莱尔先生，后者苦笑了一下，把钱掷进一只几乎空空如也的抽屜里，说：“谢谢，柯克莱斯，你是出纳人员中之明珠。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Coclès left, more or less satisfied. Praise from M. Morrel, himself a jewel among the best men in Marseille, did more for Coclès' self-esteem than a bonus of fifty écus.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, since achieving this victory over the end-of-month payments, M. Morrel had suffered some moments of agony. It had meant mustering all his resources. Fearful that the rumour concerning his difficulties might spread through the town if he was seen to be turning to such extremities, he had travelled in person to the fair at Beaucaire to sell some jewellery belonging to his wife and daughter, and part of his silver. As a result of this sacrifice, the reputation of the house of Morrel had been spared the slightest hint of a stain, but the cashbox was totally empty. With its usual egoism, all credit had slipped away, terrified by the rumours: the truth was that if he was to meet the hundred thousand francs which he would owe M. de Boville on the 15th of the present month, and the second hundred thousand francs which would fall due on the 15th of the month following, M. Morrel's only hope lay in the return of the Pharaon, which had certainly set sail, as they knew from another ship which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had come safely to port. But this ship (coming, like the Pharaon, from Calcutta) had arrived a fortnight earlier, while there was as yet no news of the Pharaon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但从月底以来，摩莱尔先生曾度过了许多焦虑的时间。为了应付月底，他曾搜尽了他所有的财源。他深怕他的窘况会在马赛传扬，所以到布揆耳的集市，把他妻子和女儿的珠宝卖了，还卖了他的一部分金银器皿。这样，公司的名誉才能依旧维持着。但他现在已经山穷水尽。借款吧，由于市上所传的那些消息，已借不到了。要偿付波维里先生这个月十五日的十万法郎和下个月十五日的十万，摩莱尔先生除了等待埃及王号回来，实在没有别的希望了。他知道埃及王号业已开出，那是他从一艘和它同时起锚的帆船上听来的，而那艘船却已经到港。那艘船象埃及王号一样，也是从加尔各答开来的，但它已在两星期前到达，而埃及王号却杳无音讯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was received by Emmanuel. The young man shied away from any unfamiliar face, because each new one meant a new creditor who had come to demand something from the shipowner, and he wished to spare his employer the unpleasantness of this visit; so he questioned the stranger; but the latter declared that he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel: he wished to speak to M. Morrel in person. With a sigh, Emmanuel called Coclès. Coclès appeared, and the young man asked him to take the stranger to see M. Morrel.</div>
