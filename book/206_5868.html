<div class="line_en">After this sleepless night I was eager to see Mr Rochester in the morning, but there was no sign of him. He had obviously told the servants that he had accidentally set fire to his room by knocking over a lighted candle As I passed his bedroom, I saw Grace Poole sitting inside, calmly mending the curtains She certainly did not look desperate or mad enough to have tried to murder her master But I decided to investigate.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How strange!" I said quietly. "Didn't anybody hear what was happening?" At this, she seemed to examine me carefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多怪啊！”我轻声说。“没有人听到动静吗？”听到这话，她好像仔细打量了我一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, in fact I locked my door," I answered, "and I shall lock it every night from now on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我把门锁上了。”我说，“从今往后我每天晚上都会锁门。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You didn't think of opening your door and looking out into the corridor?" she asked. I suddenly realized that if she suspected I knew of her guilt, she might attack me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没想起要开门朝走廊里看看？”她问。我突然意识到如果她怀疑我知道她的罪过，可能会袭击我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was amazed by her self-control, and could not understand why Mr Rochester had not asked the police to arrest her, or at least dismissed her from his service. Why had he asked me to keep the attack a secret? How could such a proud gentleman be so much in the power of one of his servants that he could not even punish her for trying to kill him? Did she know a terrible secret fron his past, which she had threatened to tell? Could he ever have been in love with her? "NO," I thought, "he could never love anyone as plain and coarse as she is. But then, I'm not beautiful either, and I sometimes think he loves me. Last night-his words, his look, his voice!" And my cheeks were red as I thought of those precious moments</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的自我克制让我吃惊，我纳闷为什么罗切斯特先生不叫警察抓她或至少解雇她。为什么他要我保守秘密？一个那么骄傲的绅士怎么能这样被自己的仆人左右，那人即使要杀他也不能予以惩罚呢？她是不是知道他过去的什么可怕的秘密，要挟要讲出来呢？他是不是曾经爱过她？“不，”我心想，“他永远不会去爱这么个平淡粗俗的人。可是我也不漂亮呀，但有时我觉得他爱我。昨天夜里——，他的话，他那眼神，他那声音！”想到那些珍贵的瞬间，我的双颊不禁红了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh yes, he went off just after breakfast, to visit a family in a big house about sixteen miles away. I know they've invited a lot of guests, who'll be staying in the house. Mr Rochester is always very popular with the ladies at these parties, so he may not come back for a week or so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，是的，他早饭后就走了、去拜访16英里外的一户人家。我知道他们请了许多客人，都住在家里。在这种晚会上罗切斯特先生总是很受女士们的欢迎，所以他可能会个把星期不回来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was now even more impatient to see Mr Rochester, but when I was having tea with Mrs Fairfax in the afternoon, the first thing she said was, It's fine weather for the master's journey."</div>

<div class="line_en">"She was eighteen then, a lovely girl, with beautiful skin, long curling black hair, and fine black eyes which shone as brightly as her jewels. She looked like a queen. All the gentlemen admired her, not only for her beauty but also for her musical skills. When she and Mr Rochester sang together, it was a delight to hear."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但是我奇怪怎么没有哪位富有的绅士爱上她，比如说罗切斯特先生。他很富，是不是？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You, Jane Eyre," I accused my reflection in the mirror, "you are the biggest fool in the world! How could you imagine that a gentleman of family and wealth would love you, a plain little governess! Just look at yourself!" And I decided that next day I would draw an honest sketch of myself, and then one of Blanche Ingram, painting the most lovely face I could imagine, according to Mrs Fairfax's description. In the future, if ever my old feelings about Mr Rochester began to return, I would only have to glance at the two pictures to see the great difference between us, and in this way common sense would destroy my foolish dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你，简·爱，”我指责着镜中的我，“你是世界上最大的傻瓜！你怎么能想象一位有家有产的绅士会爱上你这个不起眼的小家庭教师呢！好好看看你自己吧！”我决定第二天老老实实地画一张自画像，再给布朗蒂·英格姆画一张，根据费尔法斯太太的描述，画出我能想像的最迷人的脸蛋儿。今后如果我对罗切斯特先生旧情复发，我只要看看两幅画，看看我们之间的巨大差别就够了。这样理智就会打破我愚蠢的梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
