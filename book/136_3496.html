<div class="line_en">He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. The person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was O'Brien.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been incapable of speaking. O'Brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement, laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm, so that the two of them were walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们终于面对面了，他最初的冲动似乎是想逃走。他心跳得很厉害。他会说不出话来。然而，奥布莱恩依然走上前来，友好地将手搭在温斯顿的臂膀上。这样，他们两个可以并排走路。他开始说起来，带着严肃而又礼貌的独特语气，不同于大部分核心党员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But you write it very elegantly," said O'Brien. "That is not only my own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你的文章写得很漂亮，”奥布莱恩说，“这不只是我的看法。我最近同你的一个朋友谈起过，他当然是一个专家。他的名字我一时想不起来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. "Hardly scholarly," he said. "I'm only an amateur. It's not my subject. I have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿多少有点回过神来。“说不上研究，”他说，“我只是一个业余爱好者。这不是我的专业。我的工作同这种语言的实际结构也没有什么关系。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again Winston's heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference to Syme. But Syme was not only dead, he was abolished, an unperson. Any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous. O'Brien's remark must obviously have been intended as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices. They had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor, but now O'Brien halted. With the curious, disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went on:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿的心又痛苦地剧烈跳动。这无疑指的是赛姆。但赛姆不仅死了，他还被抹杀了，是一个非人。对他的任何提及都是非常危险的。奥布莱恩的话显然是作为一个信号而另有所指。通过分享思想罪的小小举动，他使他们两个成了共谋。他们继续顺着过道慢慢往前走，但奥布莱恩此时不说话了。如往常一样，他以一种奇特的、让人放松并表示好意的手势，端正了一下鼻子上的眼镜，接着又说了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in the number of verbs -- that is the point that will appeal to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary? But I am afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you? Wait.

<div class="line_en">"No," said Winston. "I didn't think it had been issued yet. We are still using the ninth in the Records Department."</div>

<div class="line_en">They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat absent-mindedly O'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore out the page and handed it to Winston.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most. There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have. It had been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O'Brien's address. This was necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover where anyone lived. There were no directories of any kind. "If you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found," was what O'Brien had been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. The conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer edges of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们至多交谈了几分钟。这件事也许只有一个意思。就是为了让温斯顿知道奥布莱恩的地址。这么做也是出于无奈，因为除了直接询问，很难知道一个人住在哪儿。没有任何的电话号码簿。“要是你想来见我，你可以在这儿找到我，”这是奥布莱恩跟他说过的。也许词典中藏有一条信息。但无论如何，有件事是肯定的。他想象中的阴谋活动是确实存在的，他已经摸到一点门道了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien's summons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay -- he was not certain. What was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while he was speaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他知道，他迟早会听从奥布莱恩的召唤。也许明天，也许很久以后——这他不能确定。所发生的只是多年前开始的过程的一部分。第一步是隐秘而自发的想法，第二步便是开始写日记。他从思想到文字，现在又从文字到行动。最后一步就会发生在友爱部了。他坦然接受。结局包含在开头之中。但这是令人恐惧的，或更确切地说，这就像死亡预告，像生命的倒计时。甚至当他在和奥布莱恩说话时，当他理解了那些言外之意时，他真有点不寒而栗。他有一脚踏进坟墓的感觉，这并不因为他早就知道坟墓就在那儿等着他而有所释怀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走了，温斯顿拿着纸条留在那儿，这次，不用再遮遮掩掩了。然而，他细心地记住纸上写的地址，几小时后，他把那张纸条连同其他一些废纸扔进了内存洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
