<div class="line_en">Frodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now, and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous "short cut" through the Old Forest the "accident" at The Prancing Pony; and his madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多又躺了下来。他舒服得不想要和人争辩，而且，他也实在不认为这次能够吵赢。他现在已经完全清醒了，过去这段时间的冒险景象全都回到脑中：在老林中那段要命的“捷径”、跃马旅店的“意外”、他在风云顶戴上魔戒的疯狂行为。当他思索着这一切，并且徒劳无功地试图回忆自己如何抵达瑞文戴尔时，唯一伴随他的声音是甘道夫对窗外噗噗地吐着烟圈的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a waterfall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多一醒过来，发现自己躺在床上，一开始他以为自己作了一个很长的恶梦，所以才晚起了。还是自己生病了？但这个房间看起来好奇怪，这里的一切都方方正正的，黑色的梁木有着雕梁画栋的气魄。他继续在床上躺着，看着地上斑斑的陽光，倾听着瀑布的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade," answered Gandalf. "The wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you showed in the Barrow. That was touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你当然会觉得模糊不清。你当时已经开始消逝了，”甘道夫回答：“你的伤口最后已经把你给击垮了。如果再晚几个小时，我们也帮不上忙了！不过，亲爱的哈比人，你的抵抗力可真是强韧！就像你在古墓的表现一样。那真是千钧一发，可能是这段旅程中最危险的一刻，我真希望你在风云顶可以撑住，不要动摇。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You seem to know a great deal already," said Frodo. "I have not spoken to the others about the Barrow. At first it was too horrible; and afterwards there were other things to think about. How do you know about it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo," said Gandalf gently, "and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory. Do not worry! Though I said "absurd" just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you -- and of the others. It is no small feat to have come so far, and through such dangers, still bearing the Ring."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佛罗多，你睡着的时候嘴巴可没闲着，”甘道夫温柔地说：“我要读取你的记忆和思绪并不困难。别担心！虽然我刚刚说你们做的是‘傻事’，但我只是开玩笑的，我觉得你和其他人很不错。你能够度过这重重危险、横越这么远的距离，依旧没有让魔戒离身，实在是件很伟大的功业。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf smiled. "I have heard all about Sam," he said. "He has no more doubts now."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings. But I did not know that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at once. I heard news of them only after I left you in June; but that story must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我的确知道他们，我也曾经和你提过他们。黑骑士就是戒灵，是魔戒之王的九名仆从。但我并不知道他们已经再度转生，否则我会选择立刻和你逃离夏尔。我是在六月离开你之后才得知这个消息的，这段经历先不急着说。至少，幸好，这次有阿拉贡出马，我们才不会全盘皆输。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you knew of the Riders already-before I met them?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你在我遇到他们之前，就知道有这些黑骑士了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Frodo, "it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of him at first. Sam never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we met Glorfindel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”佛罗多说：“是神行客救了我们。但我一开始还很怕他，山姆一直不太信任他，我想这可能一直到碰上葛罗芬戴尔，他的疑虑才消除掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am glad," said Frodo. "For I have become very fond of Strider. Well, fond is not the right word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, and grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often of you. I didn't know that any of the Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked like Bill Ferny. But then we don't know much about Men in the Shire, except perhaps the Breelanders."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很高兴这样，”佛罗多说：“因为我开始喜欢上神行客了。好吧，喜欢其实不是很正确的形容词，我的意思是他对我来说很重要，很亲切，虽然他有的时候形迹诡密，又喜欢板着一张脸。事实上，他经常让我想起你，我以前都不知道人类之中有这样的人。我一直以为他们就只是大，而且还很笨，就像奶油伯一样是个烂好人，或者像是比尔一样又笨又坏。不过，我又有什么资格批评人类呢？夏尔根本没有人类，只有布理才勉强有一半的人类居民。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I suppose not," said Frodo. "But so far my only thought has been to get here; and I hope I shan't have to go any further. It is very pleasant just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has been as much as I want."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想也是，”佛罗多说：“但到目前为止，我满脑子只有如何到这边来的念头，我希望自己不需要再去更远的地方。在这边享受人生，好好地休息是很好的；我已经流亡了一个月，我发现这一个月的冒险已经让我受够了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only a Ranger!" cried Gandalf. "My dear Frodo, that is just what the Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of the West. They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the days to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at rest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只是个游侠！”甘道夫说：“亲爱的佛罗多，这就是游侠的真实身分：他们就是北方王国的残余力量；如果没有他们的帮助，我可能早就无法和你在这说话。即使时光回溯到古代，我可能还是需要他们的帮助来对抗邪恶。我们已经到了瑞文戴尔，他们也该出现了，魔戒还没有这么简单就被驯服。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid," said Gandalf. "He is wise enough on his own ground. He thinks less than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as they say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It may be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你觉得老巴力曼很笨，那么你即使是对布理的居民也不够了解。”甘道夫说：“他在自己独特的领域上是很睿智的。他说得多，想得少且慢；但是只要给他时间，他就可以看穿一堵砖墙（这是布理的谚语）。不过，我也必须承认，中土世界没有多少人像亚拉松之子阿拉贡。渡海而来的西方皇族血脉已经快要到了尽头，这场魔戒之战可能就会是他们最后的一场冒险。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old Kings?" said Frodo in wonder. "I thought they had all vanished long ago. I thought he was only a Ranger."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know." Frodo answered. "They don't feel at all: which is an improvement, but" -- he made an effort --"I can move my arm again a little. Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold," he added, touching his left hand with his right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不确定，”佛罗多回答：“它们什么感觉都没有——这已经比以前好多了，不过，”他挣扎了一下：“我又可以移动我的手臂一些些了。没错，它又可以动了。我不会一直觉得冷冰冰的。”他用右手摸着左手说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good!" said Gandalf. "It is mending fast. You will soon be sound again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought in."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought you from this where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has hardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages. Elrond is a master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last night. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was deeply buried. and it was working inwards."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“严格来讲应该是四天三夜。精灵们在二十号晚上把你从渡口救回来，你在那边就失去了意识。我们一直很紧张，山姆除了帮我们跑腿之外，日夜都不肯离开你身边。爱隆是个身怀绝技的医者，但魔王的武器却也不是等闲人可以处哩的。说实话，我本来几乎不抱希望了，因为我怀疑你愈合的伤口中还有刀刃的碎片在里头。爱隆一直到昨晚才找到，也才把它挖出来。它藏得很深，而且还不停往里钻。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多打了个寒颤，这才记起神行客捡起的刀刃上有个缺口。“别担心！”甘道夫说：“我们已经清除掉这感染了，碎片也被融化掉了。看来哈比人对于邪恶的力量有很强的抵抗力，即使是我认识的人类战士，也可能会轻易死在那碎片之下，而你竟然承受它的折磨整整十七天。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in the wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only weaker and under their command.

<div class="line_en">"Yes, fortune or fate have helped you," said Gandalf, "not to mention courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; and that was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow shave, so to speak. You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have seized you. You could see them, and they could see you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，命运的确是站在你这边，”甘道夫说：“勇气也是你的武器。你之所以只有肩膀受伤，心脏没有被刺穿的原因，是你到最后一刻都不肯放弃抵抗。但这真的是千钧一发，当你戴上魔戒的时候，其实是最危险的；因为当时你等于半个人进了死灵的世界，他们甚至可以当场掳获你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths!

<div class="line_en">"When the Ringwraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. Close to the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the flood appeared, he rushed out, followed by Aragorn and the. others with flaming brands. Caught between fire and water, and seeing an Elf-lord revealed in his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness. Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed."</div>

This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders made straight for you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of their world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the road, or they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save you, if the white horse could not. The Riders were too swift to overtake, and too many to oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could not with stand all the Nine at once.</div>

As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released. If I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. There is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty Mountains."</div>

<div class="line_en">So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Luthien had come on earth again; and she was called Undomiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin, in Lorien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father's house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry: for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North, forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the orcs.</div>

<div class="line_en">"lndeed," said Gloin, "if it were not for the Beornings, the passage from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible. They are valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock. But their tolls are high," he added with a shake of his head; "and like Beorn of old they are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much in these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of Dale. They are good folk, the Bardings. The grandson of Bard the Bowman rules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”葛罗音说：“如果不是比翁一族的人，从谷地到瑞文戴尔之间的领土早就被邪恶势力给吞并了。他们为了保持高山隘口和卡洛克渡口的畅通而拼死奋战，但他们也付出了很大的代价，”他摇摇头说：“像以前的比翁一族一样，他们依旧不喜欢矮人，但他们还是很可靠的，在这样的乱世中，这就是很重要的一件事了。谷地的人类是对我们最友善的族群了。巴德一族人真是好人，神射手巴德的孙子依旧是他们的领袖，布兰德是巴德之子巴恩的儿子，他是个善于领导统御的国王，他们的疆界现在远到爱斯加极南和极东的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And with that Gloin embarked on a long account of the doings of the Dwarf-kingdom. He was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to hear that Dain was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having passed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were still with him: Dwalin, Gloin, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，葛罗音开始详述整个矮人王国的风土人情。他很高兴可以遇到一名这么有礼貌的倾听者；因为即使佛罗多很快就迷失在众多的异邦地名和人名之间，他也没有露出疲态，或是转移话题。事实上，对于丹恩还是山下矮人国度的国王这个消息，他非常感兴趣。丹恩现在已经老态龙钟（他刚过完两百五十岁生日），富有得让人难以想像。在侥幸从惨烈的五军之战中生存下来的十人队伍中，还有七名队员依旧建在：德瓦林、葛罗音、朵力、诺力、毕佛、波佛、庞伯，庞伯现在胖到已经没办法从客厅走到饭厅了，光要把他抬起来就得请六名年轻的矮人使尽全力才行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gloin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo about their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain. "We have done well," he said. "But in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers, many of whose. secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came. Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. You should see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You should see the stone-paved roads of many colours!

<div class="line_en">As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish minstrels began to make sweet music. Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair. Suddenly he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on the ground was a drinking-cup and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable to come to the feast. His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the South, but hardly anything from the Shire. I heard about the Ring, of course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal, he has become closer than ever these last few years. The Dunadan has told me more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner. I could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble. I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught me tottering about in the Wild."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我听说了许多的消息，有些是，有些是从孤山山脉，但几乎没有任何消息是从夏尔来的，当然，我听说了魔戒的消息。甘道夫经常来这边，他并没有告诉我很多内幕，他这几年口风越来越紧了，几乎可说滴水不漏。登纳丹告诉我的还比较多。没想到我的那枚小戒指竟然可以撼动世界！早知道我就自己轻轻松松的把魔戒带到这里来了，才不会像你们一样那么大费周章呢！我曾经想过是否该回到哈比屯去收回那枚戒指，但是我已经年纪大了，他们又不让我离开这里。喔，我说的他们，是指甘道夫和爱隆啦。他们似乎觉得魔王正上山下海寻找我的踪迹，如果抓到我在野外乱晃，可能会把我打成肉酱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Gandalf said: "The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again." Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let things be. I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound. He paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而且甘道夫还说：‘比尔博，魔戒已经选择了新主人。如果你试着重新干涉它，这对你和其他人都会有不好的结果。’怪里怪气的，就像我们家甘道夫会说的话，但他说他会照顾你，所以我也就不坚持了，看到你安然无恙我真高兴。”他停下来，用着怀疑的眼光看着佛罗多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. "I understand now," he said. "Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in for this burden: sorry about everything. Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't be helped. I wonder if it's any good trying to finish my book? But don't let's worry about it now-let's have some real News! Tell me all about the Shire!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们四周的乐音和歌声似乎都静止下来，比尔博很快地瞥了佛罗多一眼，用手揉揉眼睛。“我这才明白，”他说：“快拿开，我很抱歉。我很抱歉把这样沉重的负担交给你，我很抱歉替你带来的一切。难道冒险永远都不会有结束的时刻吗？或许是吧，总有人必须要接续这个故事。好吧，我也无能为力。不知道如果把我的书写完会不会改变这个状况？唉，现在先别担心这个了！我们来听听真正的新闻吧！告诉我夏尔到底怎么样了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring. To his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. He felt a desire to strike him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多之前在梳妆盥洗的时候，注意到魔戒依旧挂在他胸前，只是换了个更轻、更坚硬的新练子。他慢慢地拉出魔戒，比尔博伸出手，但佛罗多飞快地抽回魔戒。他惊讶地发现，他似乎不再敢正视比尔博，两人之间似乎落下了道陰影；透过那道陰影，他看见眼前是一个矮小的苍老生物，伸出骨瘦如柴的手，饥渴地向他乞讨宝贵的魔戒，他想要痛殴眼前这个怪物。">查看中文翻译</div>

Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tell-aided and corrected now and again by Sam-was of the greatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton.

<div class="line_en">At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little" held him in a spell, as soon as he began to attend to them.

Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不明白耶，”佛罗多说：“我没办法解释，但我觉得这配合得相当好。当你开始的时候，我正在打盹，这首诗却正好接续了我的梦境，一直到最后我才发现原来是你在吟诗。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;" said Bilbo. "Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for music and poetry and tales.

<div class="line_cn" title="“在你习惯之前，在这边不打盹很困难，”比尔博说：“哈比人可能永远都无法像精灵一样那么喜欢诗歌和故事，他们喜爱这些东西的程度甚至超越了食物，这还会持续很长的一段时间哪。你觉得我们偷溜出去聊聊怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and the fire was on his face like summer-light upon the trees. Near him sat the Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a star shone on his breast.

<div class="line_en">He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gar dens and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen. There they sat for some while, looking through the window at the bright stars above the steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke no more of the small news of the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他领着佛罗多回到自己的小房间，那房间面对着花园，俯瞰南方布鲁南渡口的小径。他们坐在那边，看着窗外明亮的星辰和幽深的森林，柔声地交谈着。这次，他们不再讨论遥远夏尔的消息，也忘记了身后紧紧逼迫的邪恶，只专注在他们曾经一起见识过的美好事物：精灵、星辰、翠绿的树木、每次季节转变时给森林所带来的美景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. "It is a song to Elbereth," said Bilbo. "They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come on!"</div>
