Here was the opportunity for a most interesting experiment. It was a pity that he would never know the result; still, that happened often enough in scientific research, and he had initiated other programmes that would take decades to complete.</div>

<div class="line_en">An earlier age would have regarded Professor Sullivan as an expensive luxury. His operations cost as much as a small war: indeed, he could be likened to a general conducting a perpetual campaign against an enemy who never relaxed. Professor Sullivan's enemy was the sea, and it fought him with weapons of cold and darkness -- and, above all, pressure. In his turn, he countered his adversary with intelligence and engineering skill. He had won many victories, but the sea was patient: it could wait. One day, Sullivan knew, he would make a mistake. At least he had the consolation of knowing that he could never drown. It would be far too quick for that.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Jan, he was now having second thoughts. The momentum of his original discovery had carried him thus far almost without effort. He had made his investigations, but had taken no active steps to turn his dream into reality. In a few days, however, he must make his choice. If Professor Sullivan agreed to cooperate, there was no way in which he could retreat. He must face the future he had chosen, with all its Implications.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬也在重新考虑这件事。到目前为止，事情一直进展顺利，虽然也查找过相关资料，却始终没有采取任何具体行动。这几天一定得下定决心，如果萨利文同意合作，就再不能退缩了，不管那是一个什么样的将来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Professor Sullivan was a brave and an intelligent man, but looking back on his career he was conscious of the fact that it had not brought him the sort of fame that sends a scientist's name safely down all the centuries. Here was a chance, totally unexpected and all the more attractive for that, of really establishing himself in the history books. It was not an ambition he would ever have admitted to anybody -- and, to do him justice, he would still have helped Jan even if his part in the plot remained forever secret.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dear Maia, This is going to be -- to put it mildly -- rather a surprise for you. When you get this letter, I shall no longer be on Earth. By that I don't mean that I shall have gone to the Moon, as many others have done. No: I shall be on my way to the home of the Overlords. I shall be the first man ever to leave the Solar System.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am giving this letter to the friend who is helping me: he will hold it until he knows that my plan has succeeded -- in its first phase, at least -- and that it is too late for the Overlords to interfere. I shall be so far away, and travelling at such a speed, that I doubt if any recall message can overtake me. Even if it could, it seems most unlikely that the ship would be able to put back to Earth. And I very much doubt if I'm all that important, anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我会把这封信交给一位帮助我的朋友。等他知道我成功了，就会把信给你。那时，我已经离地球很远了，而且飞船还在飞速前进，外星人召我回去的命令已经撵不上飞船了，就算命令真的传到了，飞船也不可能折回去。我还没那么重要！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"First, let me explain what led to this. You know that I've always been interested in space flight, and have always felt frustrated because we've never been allowed to go to the other planets, or to learn anything about the civilization of the Overlords. If they had never intervened, we might have reached Mars and Venus by now. I admit that it is equally probable that we would have destroyed ourselves with cobalt bombs and the other global weapons the twentieth century was developing. Yet sometimes I wish we could have had a chance of standing on our own feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我先跟你说说这是怎么回事。我喜欢太空航行，但是外星人不让我们到其他星球上去，也不让我们了解他们的文化，为此我一直灰心丧气，如果不是他们，我们早就到火星和金星上去了，也许正如他们说的，早就被二十世纪发明的钴弹或别的什么武器毁灭了。不管怎样，人类应该有机会自立。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now I don't pretend to understand how that information reached us, or where it originated. Did someone read Rashaverak's mind? Even if they had, it's hardly likely that he would have known the reference number of his sun in one of our catalogues. It's a complete mystery, and I leave it to people like Rupert to solve -- if they can! I'm just content to take the information, and to act on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，我不想弄清楚消息是怎么来的，从哪里来的，是不是有人读出了瑞沙维莱克的想法。就算是，瑞沙维莱克也不大可能知道我们人类对各种星球是怎样编码的。这些都留给鲁柏特他们去解决好了，我只想利用消息本身。">查看中文翻译</div>

You remember that silly seance he arranged and how it ended when that girl -- I forget her name -- fainted? I'd asked what star the Overlords came from, and the reply was 'NGS 549672. I'd not expected any answer, and had treated the whole business as a joke until then. But when I realized that this was a number in a star catalogue, I decided to look into it. I found that the star was in the constellation Carina -- and one of the few facts that we do know about the Overlords is that they come from that direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情是从鲁柏特的那次聚会开始的（他把我带上了这条路，但他现在还不知道这件事）。还记得那次游戏吧，有个女孩昏倒了，她的名字我已经忘了。我问外星人从哪里来，答案是“NGS549672”。我本来只是为了好玩，没有想到会有答案。那是天文学上的编码，于是我就去查找，结果发现那是船底星座的一颗行星。我们对外星人虽然了解不多，但我们知道他们正是从那个方向来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We know a lot now, through our observation of their departure, about the speed of the Overlord ships. They leave the Solar System under such tremendous accelerations that they approach the velocity of light in less than an hour. That means that the Overlords must possess some kind of propulsive system that acts equally on every atom of their ships, so that anything aboard won't be crushed instantly. I wonder why they employ such colossal accelerations, when they've got all space to play with and could take their time picking up speed? My theory is that they can somehow tap the energy fields round the stars, and so have to do their starting and stopping while they're fairly close to a sun. But that's all by the way…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们一直在观察飞船起飞，知道它在离开太阳系的过程中，不到一个小时，速度就接近了光速，那么他们的推进系统必须同时作用于整条飞船，船里的东西才不至于被压碎。问题是他们为什么要这样急剧加速呢？进入太空以后，不是还有更大的空间、更多的时间吗？可能的解释是他们在利用太阳周围的能量场，因此选择了距离太阳较近的火星起飞、降落。这些都不重要…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The important fact was that I knew how far they had to travel, and therefore how long the journey took.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最重要的是知道了飞行距离，知道了所需的飞行时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"NGS 549672 is forty light-years from Earth. The Overlords ships reach more than ninety-nine per cent of the speed of light, so the trip must last forty years of our time. Our time: that's the crux of the matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have made calculations based on what we know about the stardrive, and using the firmly-established results of Relativity theory. From the viewpoint of the passengers on one of the Overlord ships, the journey to NGS 549672 will last not more than two months -- even though by Earth's reckoning forty years will have passed. I know this seems a paradox, and if it's any consolation it's puzzled the world's best brains ever since Einstein announced it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我计算了一下，对飞船上的人来说，到 NGS549672的行程不会超过两个月，而地球上四十年已经过去了。这听起来好像有些矛盾，要知道相对论刚提出来的时候，难倒了不知多少世界级的科学家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now as you may have beard, strange things happen as one approaches the speed of light. Time itself begins to flow at a different rate -- to pass more slowly, so that what would be months on Earth would be no more than days on the ships of the Overlords. The effect is quite fundamental: it was discovered by the great Einstein more than a hundred years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你可能听说过，接近光速会出现一些怪事吧。时间流逝的速度会发生改变，比在地球上要慢，地球上几个月的时间在飞船上不过几天。这个结果爱因斯坦的相对论在一百多年前就已经证明了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps this example will show you the sort of thing that can happen, and will give you a clearer picture of the situation. If the Overlords send me straight back to Earth, I shall arrive home having aged only four months. But on Earth itself; eighty years will have passed. So you understand, Maia, that whatever happens, this is goodbye.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I hope the oxygen isn't necessary," said Jan. 'We know that they can breathe our atmosphere, but they don't seem to like it very much and I might not be able to manage theirs at all. As for the supply situation, using narcosamine solves that. It's perfectly safe. When we're under way, I'll take a shot that will knock me out for six weeks, plus or minus a few days. I'll be nearly there by then. Actually, it wasn't the food and oxygen that was worrying me, so much as the boredom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是氧气不是必带的就好了，”扬回答说，“虽然他们也可以呼吸我们的空气，但好像并不喜欢，我可能根本不能呼吸他们的空气。如果使用麻醉剂，其他的东西就不必带了。麻醉剂很安全，在飞行途中打一针，昏睡六周，等醒来时，目的地就快到了。我担心的不是食物和氧气，而是路途上太无聊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Professor Sullivan nodded thoughtfully. "Yes, narcosamine is safe enough, and can be calibrated fairly accurately. But mind you've got plenty of food handy -- you'll be ravening when you wake up, and as weak as a kitten. Suppose you starved to death because you hadn't the strength to use a can-opener?"</div>
