<div class="line_en">By about eleven o'clock the whole company was once more on the march, riding westward with the mountains on their left. Corin and Shasta rode right at the rear with the Giants immediately in front of them. Lucy and Edmund and Peridan were busy with their plans for the battle and though Lucy once said, "But where is his goosecap Highness?" Edmund only replied, "Not in the front, and that's good news enough. Leave well alone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十一点钟光景，整个部队重新行军，向西飞驰而去，大山在他们的左边。科林和沙斯塔骑马殿后，巨人们在他们的前边儿。露茜、爱德蒙和珀里丹忙于商量作战计划；虽然露茜说过：”可鹅帽殿下在哪儿啊？”爱德蒙只是答道，”不在先头部队里，那就真是好消息了。随他去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shasta told Corin most of his adventures and explained that he had learned all his riding from a horse and didn't really know how to use the reins. Corin instructed him in this, besides telling him all about their secret sailing from Tashbaan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔把他大部分惊险经历告诉了科林，并且解释道：他是跟一匹马儿学习骑马的，因此他确实不知道怎样使用缰绳。科林便教他，还把他们从塔什班城秘密出航的经过告诉了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hillside path which they were following became narrower all the time and the drop on their right hand became steeper. At last they were going in single file along the edge of a precipice and Shasta shuddered to think that he had done the same last night without knowing it. "But of course," he thought, "I was quite safe. That is why the Lion kept on my left. He was between me and the edge all the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们正在走的山径愈来愈狭窄，右首的山坡也更加陡了。最后，他们改成单行沿着悬崖的边缘走去；沙斯塔不寒而栗地想到上一夜他是不知不觉地在这悬崖边上走过去的。”然而，当然啦，”他心中想道，”我是十分安全的。那就是为什么狮子始终走在我左边的缘故。狮子自始至终是走在我和悬崖之间啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the path went left and south away from the cliff and there were thick woods on both sides of it and they went steeply up and up into the pass. There would have been a splendid view from the top if it were open ground but among all those trees you could see nothing -- only, every now and then, some huge pinnacle of rock above the tree-tops, and an eagle or two wheeling high up in the blue air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，山径向左首延伸，背离悬崖向南而去，这时两旁都是密密的树林，山径险峻陡急，他们不断地往上、往上登高，终于进入关隘。如果关隘是片开阔地带，从顶上俯瞰，准是一片好风景，可是如今置身这许多树木之中，你就什么也看不见了——只是育时看见一些巨大的石峰矗立在树顶的上方，一两只鹰在高高的蓝天里盘旋飞翔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They smell battle," said Corin, pointing at the birds. "They know we're preparing a feed for them."</div>

<div class="line_en">Here the army halted and spread out in a line, and there was a great deal of rearranging. A whole detachment of very dangerous-looking Talking Beasts whom Shasta had not noticed before and who were mostly of the cat kind (leopards, panthers, and the like) went padding and growling to take up their positions on the left. The giants were ordered to the right, and before going there they all took off something they had been carrying on their backs and sat down for a moment. Then Shasta saw that what they had been carrying and were now putting on were pairs of boots: horrid, heavy, spiked boots which came up to their knees. Then they sloped their huge clubs over their shoulders and marched to their battle position. The archers, with Queen Lucy, fell to the rear and you could first see them bending their bows and then hear the twangtwang as they tested the strings. And wherever you looked you could see people tightening girths, putting on helmets, drawing swords, and throwing cloaks to the ground. There was hardly any talking now. It was very solemn and very dreadful. "I'm in for it now -- I really am in for it now," thought Shasta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="军队在这儿止步了，展开成为一条战线，而且做了许多新的安排。整整一队是外貌狰狞的说人话的野兽，沙斯塔以前不曾注意它们；它们大部分都属于猫科（花豹、黑豹，诸如此类），咆哮着大踏步走到左边去进入阵地。巨人们奉命开拔到右边去，开拔之前，他们都从背上卸下他们所背的东西，并且在地上坐了～会儿。于是沙斯塔看到巨人们刚才背着的、现在正穿上脚去的，乃是一双双的靴子：可怕的、沉重的、底部有尖钉的、长及膝头的靴子。巨人们接着就掮着大棒进入他们的阵地。弓箭手以及露茜女王调到了后边儿，你能首先看见他们弯弓，其次听到他们试拉弓弦的嘣嘣声。不论你朝哪儿看，你处处看得见人们在收紧肚带，戴上头盔，抽出刀剑，把大氅丢在地上。现在没有什么人谈话了。十分庄严，十分可怕。”现在我已经不能中途退回了——现在我确确实实不能中途退回了。”沙斯塔心中想道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had crossed the neck of the pass and come a good deal lower they reached more open ground and from here Shasta could see all Archenland, blue and hazy, spread out below him and even (he thought) a hint of the desert beyond it. But the sun, which had perhaps two hours or so to go before it set, was in his eyes and he couldn't make things out distinctly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们经过了隘口，又往下走了好多路，便来到比较开阔的地带，沙斯塔从这儿能看见全部阿钦兰国土，蓝悠悠，雾蒙蒙，展现在他的脚下，（他认为，）他甚至望见了阿钦兰背后隐隐约约的大沙漠。然而，也许再过两个钟点就要下山的太阳，光芒直射他的眼睛，他眼花缭乱，没法儿把景物看个清清楚楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The trumpet at last! On the move now -- now trotting the banner streaming out in the wind. They had topped low ridge now, and below them the whole scene sudden opened out; a little, many-towered castle with its gate towards them. No moat, unfortunately, but of course the gate shut and the portcullis down. On the walls they could see, like little white dots, the faces of the defenders. Down below, about fifty of the Calormenes, dismounted, were steadily swinging a great tree trunk against the gate. But at once the scene changed. The main bulk of Rabadash's men had been on foot ready to assault the gate. But now he had seen the Narnians sweeping down from the ridge. There is no doubt those Calormenes are wonderfully trained. It seemed to Shasta only a second before a whole line of the enemy were on horseback again, wheeling round to meet them, swinging towards them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喇叭声终于响了！现在部队行动起来了——现在马儿小跑着——旗帜在风中飘扬翻动着。现在他们爬上一个低低的山脊，山下整个景色突然展开在他们的面前。一个多塔楼小城堡，城门正对着他们。不幸没有护城河：城门当然是关上的，吊闸放下来了。他们望得见城墙上保卫者的脸，像小小的白点子。城下，大约五十个卡乐门人下了马，正稳稳地晃动着一根大树干撞击城门。但这景象立刻就发生变化了。拉巴达什的主力部队一直是下马步行准备攻击城门的，现在他们看到纳尼亚军队从山脊上奔腾而下。毫无疑问，这些卡乐门部队训练有素。沙斯塔觉得敌人在一秒钟内都上了马，形成整齐的一列队伍，拨转马头，向他们迎过来“">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when at last the two lines met he had really very littler idea of what happened. There was a frightful confusion`; and an appalling noise. His sword was knocked clean out of his hand pretty soon. And he'd got the reins tangled somehow. Then he found himself slipping. Then a spear came straight at him and as he ducked to avoid it he rolled right off his horse, bashed his left knuckles terribly against someone else's armour, and then -- But it is no use trying to describe the battle from Shasta's point of view; he understood too little of the fight in general and even of his own part in it. The best way I can tell you what really happened is to take you some miles away to where the Hermit of the Southern March sat gazing into the smooth pool beneath the spreading tree, with Bree and Hwin and Aravis beside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，最后两军相遇时，他确实对于现场发生的事情一点也不清楚。可怕的混乱和骇人听闻的呐喊。他手中的刀不久就干脆被打掉了。他手中的缰绳不知怎么也搞丢了。他发觉自己正在滑下马来。一枝长矛笔直地向他刺过来，他低头避开时从马上滚了下来，左膝关节猛烈地撞在别人的盔甲上，于是……。但试图从沙斯塔的观点去描写战争是毫无用处的；他对一般战斗懂得太少，连他自己在战斗中所扮演的角色他也不明白。把战役实际情况告诉你，最好的办法就是带你到几英里之外的南征隐士家里去，他正在大树的树阴下向平静的池水里目不转睛地凝视，布里、赫温和阿拉维斯都在他身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now a gallop. The ground between the two armies grew less every moment. Faster, faster. All swords out now, all shields up to the nose, all prayers said, all teeth clenched. Shasta was dreadfully frightened. But it suddenly came into his head, "If you funk this, you'll funk every battle all your life. Now or never."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在是一阵小跑，两军之间的距离时时刻刻都在缩短。跑得愈来愈快，愈来愈快。所有的刀都出鞘了，所有的盾牌都举到鼻子跟前了，所有的祷告都做过了，所有的牙齿都咬紧了。沙斯塔惊惶得厉害。但他脑子里突然想到：”这次你如果畏缩害怕，那么，你这一生，每打一次仗，都要畏缩害怕了。千载难逢，机不可失！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I see one -- two -- three eagles wheeling in the gap by Stormness Head. One is the oldest of all the eagles. He would not be out unless battle was at hand. I see him wheel to and fro, peering down sometimes at Anvard and sometimes to the east, behind Stormness. Ah -- I see now what Rabadash and his men have been so busy at all day. They have felled and lopped a great tree and they are now coming out of the woods carrying it as a ram. They have learned something from the failure of last night's assult. He would have been wiser if he had set his men to making ladders: but it takes too long and he is impatient. Fool that he is! He ought to have ridden back to Tashbaan as soon as the first attack failed, for his whole plan depended on speed and surprise. Now they are bringing their ram into position. King Lune's men are shooting hard from the walls. Five Calormenes have fallen: but not many will. They have their shields above their heads. Rabadash is giving his orders now. With him are his most trusted lords, fierce Tarkaans from the eastern provinces. I can see their faces. There is Corradin of Castle Tormunt, and Azrooh, and Chlamash, and Ilgamuth of the twisted lip, and a tall Tarkaan with a crimson beard --"</div>

<div class="line_en">For it was in this pool that the Hermit looked when he wanted to know what was going on in the world outside the green walls of his hermitage. There, as in a mirror, he could see, at certain times, what was going on in the streets of cities far farther south than Tashbaan, or what ships were putting into Redhaven in the remote Seven Isles, or what robbers or wild beasts stirred in the great Western forests between Lantern Waste and Telmar. And all this day he had hardly left his pool, even to eat or drink, for he knew that great events were on foot in Archenland. Aravis and the Horses gazed into it too. They could see it was a magic pool: instead of reflecting the tree and the sky it revealed cloudy and coloured shapes moving, always moving, in its depths. But they could see nothing clearly. The Hermit could and from time to time he told them what he saw. A little while before Shasta rode into his first battle, the Hermit had begun speaking like this:</div>

The Calormene horses are mad with terror already. Now the Cats are in among them. But Rabadash has reformed his line and has a hundred men in the saddle. They're riding to meet the Narnians. There's only a hundred yards between the two lines now. Only fifty. I can see King Edmund, I can see the Lord Peridan. There are two mere children in the Narnian line. What can the King be about to let them into battle? Only ten yards -- the lines have met. The Giants on the Narnian right are doing wonders… but one's down… shot through the eye, I suppose. The centre's all in a muddle. I can see more on the left. There are the two boys again. Lion alive! one is Prince Corm. The other, like him as two peas. It's your little Shasta.

<div class="line_en">"How can I tell?" said the Hermit. "The Cats have done their work. All the riderless horses are dead or escaped now: no retreat for the Calormenes on them. Now the Cats are turning back into the main battle. They're leaping on the rams-men. The ram is down. Oh, good! good! The gates are opening from the inside: there's going to be a sortie. The first three are out. It's King Lune in the middle: the brothers Dar and Darrin on each side of him. Behind them are Tran and Shar and Cole with his brother Colin. There are ten -- twenty -- nearly thirty of them out by now. The Calormen line is being forced back upon them. King Edmund is dealing marvellous strokes. He's just slashed Corradin's head off. Lots of Calormenes have thrown down their arms and are running for the woods. Those that remain are hard pressed. The Giants are closing in on the right -- Cats on the left -- King Lune from their rear. The Calormenes are a little knot now, fighting back to back. Your Tarkaan's down, Bree. Lune and Azrooh are fighting hand to hand; the King looks like winning -- the King is keeping it up well -- the King has won. Azrooh's down. King Edmund's down -- no, he's up again: he's at it with Rabadash. They're fighting in the very gate of the castle. Several Calormenes have surrendered. Darrin has killed Ilgamuth. I can't see what's happened to Rabadash. I think he's dead, leaning against the castle wall, but I don't know. Chlamash and King Edmund are still fighting but the battle is over everywhere else. Chlamash has surrendered. The battle is over. The Calormenes are utterly defeated."</div>

<div class="line_en">When Shasta fell off his horse he gave himself up for lost. But horses, even in battle, tread on human beings very much less than you would suppose. After a very horrible ten minutes or so Shasta realized suddenly that there were no longer any horses stamping about in the immediate neighbourhood and that the noise (for there were still a good many noises going on) was no longer that of a battle. He sat up and stared about him. Even he, little as he knew of battles, could soon see that the Archenlanders and Narnians had won. The only living Calormenes he could see were prisoners, the castle gates were wide open, and King Lune and King Edmund were shaking hands across the battering ram. From the circle of lords and warriors around them there arose a sound of breathless and excited, but obviously cheerful conversation. And then, suddenly, it all united and swelled into a great roar of laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔从马上跌下来时，他认为自己没有命了。但马儿踩人踏人，即使在战场上，也远比你料想的要少得多。非常恐怖的十分钟过去以后，沙斯塔突然发现：在邻近的地方不再有什么马儿在跺脚了，而喧闹的声音（因为仍旧有许许多多持续的喧闹声）不再是战争的声音了。他坐了起来，瞪眼打量着周围。虽然他对战争什么也不知道，但连他也很快就看出来了：阿钦兰人和纳尼亚人已经胜利了。他所看见的活着的卡乐门人便是俘虏。城堡的大门大开着，伦恩国王和爱德蒙国王正越过攻城槌彼此握手。在他们周围的一圈王公大人和战士们中间，响起了一阵激动不已但显然很愉快的谈话。接着，谈话声突然联结起来，扩展成为轰然大笑的声音。—">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shasta. picked himself up, feeling uncommonly stiff, and ran towards the sound to see what the joke was. A very curious sight met his eyes. The unfortunate Rabadash appeared to be suspended from the castle walls. His feet, which were about two feet from the ground, were kicking wildly. His chain-shirt was somehow hitched up so that it was horribly tight under the arms and came half way over his face. In fact he looked just as a man looks if you catch him in the very act of getting into a stiff shirt that is a little too small for him. As far as could be made out afterwards (and you may be sure the story was well talked over for many a day) what happened was something like this. Early in the battle one of the Giants had made an unsuccessful stamp at Rabadash with his spiked boot: unsuccessful because it didn't crush Rabadash, which was what the Giant had intended, but not quite useless because one of the spikes tore the chain mail, just as you or I might tear an ordinary shirt. So Rabadash, by the time he encountered Edmund at the gate, had a hole in the back of his hauberk. And when Edmund pressed him back nearer and nearer to the wall, he jumped up on a mounting block and stood there raining down blows on Edmund from above. But then, finding that this position, by raising him above the heads of everyone else, made him a mark for every arrow from the Narnian bows, he decided to jump down again. And he meant to look and sound -- no doubt for a moment he did look and sound -- very grand and very dreadful as he jumped, crying, "The bolt of Tash falls from above." But he had to jump sideways because the crowd in front of him left him no landing place in that direction. And then, in the neatest way you could wish, the tear in the back of his hauberk caught on a hook in the wall. (Ages ago this hook had had a ring in it for tying horses to.) And there he found himself, like a piece of washing hung up to dry, with everyone laughing at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔爬起身来，觉得四肢异乎寻常地不灵活，他朝着哄笑声跑过去，去看看闹的是什么笑话。他所见到的，是一幅十分奇怪的景象。倒霉的拉巴达什看来被悬挂在城堡的墙上。他的脚离地两英尺光景，正疯狂地乱踢着。他的锁子甲有点儿被吊了起来，腋下紧得可怕，中间遮住了半个脸。事实上，他看上去就像一个人正把一件尺寸太小的硬衬衫穿上身去时的模样儿。就后来尽可能收集到的材料看来（你可以确信无疑，这个故事被人们反复讲了好多天），事情的经过大致是这样的：刚开仗时，有个巨人用他的尖钉大靴子不成功地踩了拉巴达什一脚；不成功，是指他未能如愿以偿地把拉巴达什踩个稀巴烂；但也不是毫无作用，因为靴子上的尖钉刺破了锁子甲，就像你或我可能撕破一件普通的衬衫一样。所以，拉巴达什正和爱德蒙在城门口交手搏斗时，他那锁子甲的背后有个窟窿。当爱德蒙逼得他愈来愈靠近城墙时，他跳上了一个高台，他站在台上，手中的剑雨点般向爱德蒙攻击。但接着他就觉得这个地位既使他高出于众人之上，又使他成为纳尼亚弓箭手的众矢之的，他决定重新跳下台来。他有意要观察风色，试探试探——毫无疑问，他确实观察试探了一会儿——他跳得十分庄严十分可怕，口中大声喊道：”塔什神的雷霆从天上打下来了。”但他不得不朝旁边跳，因为他前边儿的人群很挤，正前方已没有他插足的地方。接着，用你可以期望的最简洁的方式来说，他背部锁子甲上的窟窿，被墙上一个钩子钩住了（几百年前，这钩子曾经是个系马的铁圈）。他发现自己像是一件洗好的、挂在那儿晾干的衣服，人人都在嘲笑他哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then turning to Rabadash he said, "Your royal Highness, if you had given that challenge a week ago, I'll answer for it there was no one in King Edmund's dominion, from the High King down to the smallest Talking Mouse, who would have refused it. But by attacking our castle of Anvard in time of peace without defiance sent, you have proved yourself no knight, but a traitor, and one rather to be whipped by the hangman than to be suffered to cross swords with any person of honour. Take him down, bind him, and carry him within till our pleasure is further known."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请陛下允许我插一句，”国王伦恩对爱德蒙说道，”不要这样。”然后，他转过来对拉巴达什说道：”殿下，如果你曾在一个星期前提出挑战书，我就会保证：在国王爱德蒙的国土内，上至至尊王，下至最小的会说人话的耗子，谁也不会拒绝你的请求。然而，你在和平时期，挑战书也不送一份，就进攻我们的安瓦德城堡，你的行为证明你自己不是什么真正的武士，而是个奸贼，是个只配由刽子手来鞭打的家伙，不配由任何高贵的人持刀与之交锋。把他带下去，把他绑起来，带他到城里去，等我们公布了我们欢乐的大喜事以后再说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Strong hands wrenched Rabadash's sword from him and he was carried away into the castle, shouting, threatening, cursing, and even crying. For though he could have faced torture he couldn't bear being made ridiculous. In Tashbaan everyone had always taken him seriously.</div>
