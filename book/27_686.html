<div class="line_en">Chelsea had been one of Elizabeth's best friends at Stanford. As freshmen, they'd lived in adjacent dorms in Wilbur Hall, a big residential complex on the eastern edge of campus, and had immediately hit it off. Elizabeth wore a red-white-and-blue "Don't mess with Texas' T-shirt and a big smile the first time they met. Chelsea found her sweet, smart, and fun.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chelsea Burkett was burning out. It was the late summer of 2009 and she was working long hours at a Palo Alto startup, juggling what at a more established company would have been five different roles. Not that she was averse to hard work. Like most twenty-five-year-old Stanford graduates, striving was in her DNA. But she yearned for a little inspiration and she wasn't getting any from her job: Doostang, her employer, was a career website for finance professionals.</div>

<div class="line_en">Both were social and outgoing, with matching blue eyes. They did their share of drinking and partying and pledged a sorority, partly as a play for better housing. But, while Chelsea was a regular teenager still trying to find herself, Elizabeth seemed to know exactly who she wanted to be and what she wanted to do. When she returned to campus with a patent she'd written at the beginning of sophomore year, Chelsea was blown away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chelsea went to see Elizabeth at the Hillview Avenue office. It didn't take her friend long to sell her on Theranos. Elizabeth talked fervently about a future in which the company would save lives with its technology. It sounded a lot more interesting and noble to Chelsea than helping investment bankers find jobs. And Elizabeth was so persuasive. She had this intense way of looking at you while she spoke that made you believe in her and want to follow her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sunny was a force of nature, and not in a good way. Though only about five foot five and portly, he made up for his diminutive stature with an aggressive, in-your-face management style. His thick eyebrows and almond-shaped eyes, set above a mouth that drooped at the edges and a square chin, projected an air of menace. He was haughty and demeaning toward employees, barking orders and dressing people down.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she reported for her new job a few days later, Chelsea learned that she wasn't the only friend Elizabeth had hired. Just a week earlier, Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani had come on board as a senior Theranos executive. Chelsea had met Sunny once or twice but didn't know him well. She just knew he was Elizabeth's boyfriend and that they were living together in an apartment in Palo Alto. Elizabeth hadn't mentioned anything about Sunny joining the company, yet Chelsea now faced the reality of having to work with him. Or was it for him? She wasn't sure whether she reported to Sunny or to Elizabeth. Sunny's title, executive vice chairman, was both lofty and vague. Whatever his role was meant to be, he didn't waste any time asserting himself. From the get-go, he involved himself in every aspect of the company and became omnipresent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Born and raised in Mumbai, Sunny first came to the United States in 1986 for his undergraduate studies. Afterward, he worked as a software engineer for a decade at Lotus and Microsoft. In 1999, he joined an Israeli entrepreneur named Liron Petrushka at a Santa Clara, California, startup called CommerceBid. com. Petrushka was developing a software program that would enable companies to pit their suppliers against one another in live online auctions to secure economies of scale and lower prices.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chelsea took an immediate dislike to him even though he made an effort to be nicer to her in deference to her friendship with Elizabeth. She didn't understand what her friend saw in this man, who was nearly two decades older than she was and lacking in the most basic grace and manners. All her instincts told her Sunny was bad news, but Elizabeth seemed to have the utmost confidence in him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sunny had been a presence in Elizabeth's life since the summer before she went to college. They'd met in Beijing in her third year attending Stanford's Mandarin program. Elizabeth had struggled to make friends that summer and gotten bullied by some of the students on the trip. Sunny, the lone adult among a group of college kids, had stepped in and come to her aid. That's how Elizabeth's mother, Noel, described the genesis of their relationship to Lorraine Fuisz.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sector's leader, Commerce One, had just gone public and seen its stock price triple on its first day of trading. It finished the year up more than 1,000 percent. That November, just a few months after Sunny was named CommerceBid's president and chief technology officer, Commerce One acquired the startup for $232 million in cash and stock. It was a breathtaking price for a company that had just three clients testing its software and barely any revenues. As the company's second-highest-ranking executive, Sunny pocketed more than $40 million. His timing was perfect. Five months later, the dot-com bubble popped and the stock market came crashing down. Commerce One eventually filed for bankruptcy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="网络竞标龙头第一商务（Commerce One）股票才刚上市，交易首日股价就大涨三倍，那年最后以超过十倍的涨幅作收。同年十一月，桑尼出任CommerceBid总裁和首席技术官，短短几个月后，第一商务以二亿三千二百万美元的现金和股票收购CommerceBid，这对一家只有三个客户测试其软件、几乎没有任何营收的公司，是令人咋舌的天价。桑尼身为CommerceBid第二号高层，有超过四千万美元入袋，时机刚刚好，因为五个月后网络泡沫就破掉，股市一泻千里，第一商务最后声明破产。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet Sunny didn't see himself as lucky. In his mind, he was a gifted businessman and the Commerce One windfall was a validation of his talent. When Elizabeth met him a few years later, she had no reason to question that. She was an impressionable eighteen-year-old girl who saw in Sunny what she wanted to become: a successful and wealthy entrepreneur. He became her mentor, the person who would teach her about business in Silicon Valley.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sunny spent the decade after his brief and lucrative stint at CommerceBid not doing much aside from enjoying his money and giving Elizabeth advice behind the scenes.

<div class="line_en">By the time he joined Theranos in September 2009, Sunny's legal record contained at least one red flag. To dodge taxes on his CommerceBid earnings, he'd hired the accounting firm BDO Seidman, which arranged for him to invest in a tax shelter. The maneuver generated an artificial tax loss of $41 million that offset his CommerceBid gains, all but eliminating his tax liability. When the Internal Revenue Service cracked down on the practice in 2004, Sunny was forced to pay the millions of dollars in back taxes he owed in a settlement with the agency. He turned around and sued BDO, claiming that he had been unsophisticated in tax matters and that the firm had knowingly misled him. The suit was settled on undisclosed terms in 2008.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇〇九年九月加入Theranos时，桑尼已经至少有一次不良的法律纪录。为了规避CommerceBid所得的税负，他聘请立本会计事务所（BDO Seidman）替他安排避税投资，制造出四千一百万投资亏损，抵销掉他的CommerceBid所得，几乎不必缴税。美国国税局（Internal Revenue Service）二〇〇四年全面取缔这种行为，逼得他不得不与国税局达成协议，补缴数百万美元的税。接着，他回头控告立本，宣称他不熟悉税务问题，立本蓄意误导他。这起官司在二〇〇八年和解，和解条件不公开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It isn't clear exactly when Elizabeth and Sunny became romantically involved, but it appears to have been not long after she dropped out of Stanford. When they'd first met in China in the summer of 2002, Sunny was married to a Japanese artist named Keiko Fujimoto and living in San Francisco. By October 2004, he was listed as "a single man" on the deed to a condominium he purchased on Channing Avenue in Palo Alto. Other public records show Elizabeth moved into that apartment in July 2005.</div>

<div class="line_en">The way Sunny dressed was also meant to telegraph affluence, though not necessarily taste. He wore white designer shirts with puffy sleeves, acid-washed jeans, and blue Gucci loafers. His shirts' top three buttons were always undone, causing his chest hair to spill out and revealing a thin gold chain around his neck. A pungent scent of cologne emanated from him at all times. Combined with the flashy cars, the overall impression was of someone heading out to a nightclub rather than to the office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的穿着打扮同样是以炫富为目的，只是未必有品味。他会穿有泡泡袖的名牌衬衫，搭配酸洗牛仔裤，脚踩蓝色古驰（Gucci）乐福鞋，衬衫最上方三个扣子总是不扣，藏不住胸毛及脖子上细细的金项链。身上随时散发刺鼻古龙水香味，再加上显眼浮夸的车子，整体给人感觉这个人是去夜店，而不是去上班。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tax troubles aside, Sunny was proud of his wealth and liked to broadcast it with his cars. He drove a black Lamborghini Gallardo and a black Porsche 911. Both had vanity license plates. The one on the Porsche read "DAZKPTL" in mock reference to Karl Marx's treatise on capitalism. The Lamborghini's plate was "VDIVICI," a play on the phrase "Veni, vidi, vici" ("I came, I saw, I conquered"), which Julius Caesar used to describe his quick and decisive victory at the Battle of Zela in a letter to the Roman Senate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="撇开税务困扰，桑尼对于自己的财富很自豪，喜欢用车子炫富。他有一辆黑色蓝宝基尼Gallardo，还有一辆黑色保时捷911，两辆的车牌都很虚荣，保时捷的车牌是DAZKPTL，模仿马克思的《资本论》（译按：《资本论》的德文为Das Kapital）；蓝宝基尼那台则是VDIVICI，玩弄名言Veni， vidi， vici（我来，我见，我征服），是凯撒（Julius Caesar）在泽拉战役出师告捷后，写给罗马元老院（Roman Senate）的用语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sunny's expertise was software and that was where he was supposed to add value at Theranos. In one of the first company meetings he attended, he bragged that he'd written a million lines of code. Some employees thought that was preposterous. Sunny had worked at Microsoft, where teams of software engineers had written the Windows operating system at the rate of one thousand lines of code per year of development. Even if you assumed Sunny was twenty times faster than the Windows developers, it would still have taken him fifty years to do what he claimed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑尼的专业是软件，这也是他应该为Theranos贡献的价值。刚进公司时，他在一次会议上夸口他总共写了百万行程序，有些员工觉得他的说法荒谬可笑。以他工作过的微软来说，软件工程师团队是以每年写一千行程序的速度，在写Windows操作系统，假设桑尼的速度比微软工程师快二十倍，要写出他所宣称的百万行也要花上五十年。">查看中文翻译</div>

When Don Lucas showed up at the office once or twice a month to visit with Elizabeth, Sunny would suddenly vanish.

<div class="line_en">It sounded cutting-edge, but there was a catch: the blood-test results had to be reliable for the computer program's predictions to have any value, and Chelsea started to have her doubts about that soon after she arrived in Belgium. Theranos was supposed to help Centocor assess how patients were responding to an asthma drug by measuring a biomarker in their blood called allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, or IgE, but the Theranos devices seemed very buggy to Chelsea. There were frequent mechanical failures. The cartridges either wouldn't slot into the readers properly or something inside the readers would malfunction. Even when the devices didn't break down, it could be a challenge coaxing any kind of output from them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看似很尖端的技术，但其中有个蹊跷：血液检测结果必须是可靠的，电脑程序的预测才有价值可言。而雀儿喜抵达比利时不久就开始对此产生怀疑。本来Theranos应该测量病人血液中的免疫球蛋白E（IgE），以协助Centocor评估病人对某种气喘药物的反应，但是公司设备在雀儿喜看来却错误百出，机械故障频繁，不是卡匣插不进读卡机，就是读卡机里有东西故障，就算设备没坏，要它吐出个结果还是百般困难。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Elizabeth pitched pharmaceutical executives now, she told them that Theranos could forecast how patients would react to the drugs they were taking. Patients' test results would be input into a proprietary computer program the company had developed.

<div class="line_en">But there were other things besides the wireless connection that could interfere with the generation of a result. Nearly all blood tests require a certain amount of dilution to lower the concentration of substances in the blood that can wreak havoc on the test. In the case of chemiluminescent immunoassays -- the class of tests the Edison performed -- diluting the blood was necessary to filter out its light-absorbing pigments and other constituents that could interfere with the emission of the light signal. The amount of dilution the Theranos system required was greater than usual because of the small size of the blood samples Elizabeth insisted on. For the reader to have enough liquid to work with, the volume of the samples had to be increased significantly. The only way to do that was to dilute the blood more. And that in turn made the light signal weaker and harder to measure precisely. Put simply, some dilution was good, but too much dilution was bad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了无线通信，还有其他因素会干扰检测结果的产生。几乎所有血液检测都需要一定分量的稀释，以便降低血中有碍检测物质的浓度，以爱迪生运行的化学发光免疫测定来说，稀释血液是必要的，才能过滤掉会吸收光线的血液色素，以及会干扰光线信号发射的成分。然而，Theranos系统所需的稀释量高于一般，这是因为伊莉莎白坚持血液样本要很小，所以为了让读卡机有足够液体可运作，血液样本的分量必须增加很多，唯一的方式是把血液稀释成更多，而这又会导致光线信号变弱，更难以精准测量。简单说，做点稀释是好的，但是稀释太多就不好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sunny always blamed the wireless connection, and he was right in some instances. The process by which test results were generated involved a transatlantic round-trip of ones and zeros: when the blood test was completed, a cellular antenna on the reader beamed the voltage data produced by the light signal to a server in Palo Alto. The server analyzed the data and beamed back a final result to a cell phone in Belgium. When the cellular connection was weak, the data transmission would fail.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sunny didn't know or understand any of this because he had no background in medicine, much less laboratory science. Nor did he have the patience to listen to the scientists' explanations. It was easier to just blame the cellular connection.

<div class="line_en">What Chelsea didn't know at the time was that one of their pharmaceutical partners had already walked away from the startup. Earlier that year, Pfizer had informed Theranos that it was ending their collaboration because it was underwhelmed by the results of the Tennessee validation study. Elizabeth had tried to put the best spin she could on the fifteen-month study in a twenty-six-page report she'd sent to the New York pharmaceutical giant, but the report had betrayed too many glaring inconsistencies. The study had failed to show any clear link between drops in the patients' protein levels and the administration of the antitumor drugs. And the report had copped to some of the same snafus Chelsea was now witnessing in Belgium, such as mechanical failures and wireless transmission errors. It had blamed the latter on "dense foliage, metal roofs, and poor signal quality due to remote location."</div>

He got Chelsea and Sunny an audience with high-ranking officials at the Mexican Social Security Institute, the agency that runs the country's public health-care system. IMSS approved the shipment of two dozen Edison readers to a hospital in Mexico City. The hospital, a sprawling facility called Hospital General de México, was located in Colonia Doctores, one of the city's most crime-ridden neighborhoods.

The epidemic had spread to Asia, and the country was one of the region's hardest hit with tens of thousands of cases and more than two hundred deaths. But unlike in Mexico, it wasn't clear that Theranos's activities in Thailand were sanctioned by local authorities. Rumors were circulating among employees that Sunny's connections there were shady and that he was paying bribes to obtain blood samples from infected patients.

She offered to stay on for a transition period, but Elizabeth and Sunny didn't want her to. If Chelsea was leaving, better she do so right away, they told her. They asked her not to say anything to the three employees who reported to her on her way out. Chelsea protested. It didn't feel right to flee like a thief in the middle of the night. But Sunny and Elizabeth were firm: she was not to speak to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她向伊莉莎白表明辞职之意，但是决定把内心的疑虑按捺不说，改以周末通勤太辛苦为由，说她想搬到洛杉矶，反正这也是实话。她提出可以协助过渡期转手，但伊莉莎白和桑尼不愿意，他们告诉她，如果要走，最好马上走。他们要求她不可向她手下同事透露任何离职的事，雀儿喜反对，觉得自己不该像个小偷半夜逃走，但是他们十分坚持，不准她说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chelsea walked out of the building and into the Palo Alto sunshine with conflicting emotions. The dominant one was relief. But she also felt bad that she hadn't been able to say goodbye to her team and to tell them why she was leaving. She would have given them the official reason -- that she was moving to L. A.-- but Sunny and Elizabeth hadn't trusted her to do that. They'd wanted to control the narrative of her departure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雀儿喜走出公司大楼，踏进帕罗奥图的阳光下，心里五味杂陈。最主要的感觉是松了一口气，但也很难过没能好好跟团队同事道别、说明辞职理由。她会给他们一个冠冕堂皇的理由——她要搬到洛杉矶——无奈桑尼和伊莉莎白不相信她会这么做，他们想控管有关她离职的说词。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chelsea also worried about Elizabeth. In her relentless drive to be a successful startup founder, she had built a bubble around herself that was cutting her off from reality. And the only person she was letting inside was a terrible influence. How could her friend not see that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雀儿喜也担心伊莉莎白：在她持续不断冲向成功创业家的路上，她给自己造了个大泡泡，把自己隔离于真实之外，只愿让一个人进入，而那个人却是个可怕的榜样。她这个朋友怎么看不透呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
