<div class="line_en">He was treated badly by most of the people around him. Noah was jealous because Oliver went out to burials while he was left back in the shop, so he treated him even worse than before. Charlotte treated him badly because Noah did. And Mrs Sowerberry was his enemy because Mr Sowerberry was supposed to be his friend.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver was now officially an undertaker's assistant. It was a good, sickly time of year, and coffins were selling well. Oliver gained a lot of experience in a short time, and was interested to see how brave some people were after a death in the family. During funerals for some rich people, for example, he saw that the people who had cried the loudest in church usually recovered the fastest afterwards. He noticed how in other wealthy families the wife or the husband often seemed quite cheerful and calm despite the recent death -- just as if nothing had happened. Oliver was very surprised to see all this, and greatly admired them for controlling their sadness so well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥利弗现已是棺材店老板的正式助理，这一年年景很好，疾病成灾，棺材生意兴旺。在不长的时间里他就积累了许多经验。他很有兴趣地发现有些人在家里死了人时表现得沉着勇敢。比如说，他发现在一些有钱人的葬礼上，在教堂里哭声最大的人往往都是事后恢复最快的人。他注意到，还有一些富人家，尽管刚刚死了人，但无论死者的妻子还是丈夫，都显得轻松愉快、镇定自若——好像什么都没发生过一样。奥利弗对这些感到不可理解，对他们能很好地克制悲伤不流露于外佩服极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day something happened which might seem unimportant, but which had a great effect on Oliver's future. Noah was in a particularly bad mood one dinner time, and so he tried to make Oliver cry by hitting him, pulling his hair, and calling him horrible names. This was all unsuccessful, so he tried personal insults.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，索尔贝里先生从外面回来了，他知道了发生的一切（是从女人们的嘴里听说的），就狠狠地打了奥利弗一顿，以至于班布尔先生和索尔贝里太太都感到满意了。索尔贝里先生不是个狠心的人，可他没有别的办法，他很清楚，假如他不惩罚奥利弗，他老婆是不会饶过他的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, alone in the room with the coffins, Oliver cried bitter, lonely tears. He did not sleep, and very early in the morning, before anyone was awake, he quietly unlocked the shop door and left the house. He ran up the street and through the town as far as the main road, where he saw a sign that told him it was just seventy miles from there to London. The name London gave the boy an idea. That huge place! Nobody, not even Mr Bumble, could ever find him there! He had heard old men in the workhouse say it was a good place for brave boys, and that there was always work there for those that wanted it. It would be the best place for him. He jumped to his feet and walked forward again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，一个人呆在棺材房里，奥利弗哭了，流下了辛酸、孤单的眼泪。他一夜没睡，第二天一大早，趁着还没有一个人起床，便轻轻地打开了铺子的门，离开了这座房子。他沿街道跑下去，尽快地穿过镇子，直走到大路上。他看见一块牌子上写着“此地距伦敦七十英里整”。伦敦这个地名使这个孩子产生了一个念头。那是个极大的地方！在那儿没人能找到他，就连班布尔先生也找不到！在济贫院里他听老人们说过，那是个勇敢的孩子去的好地方，而且在那儿很容易找到事做。对他来说那将是最好的去处。他一跃而起，朝前走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day he tried to beg for money, but large signs in some villages warned him that anyone caught begging would be sent to prison. Travellers on the road refused to give him money; They said he was a lazy young dog and didn't deserve anything. Farmers threatened to send their dogs after him. When he waited outside pubs, the pub -- owners chased him away because They thought he had come to steal something. Only two people were kind enough to feed him: an old woman and a gate-keeper on the road. If They had not given him some food, he surely would have died like his mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三天，他不得不乞讨小钱了。但在一些村子，他能看到大的牌子，上面写着警告说，任何乞讨的人，一旦抓住后，将被送进监狱。路上的行人拒绝给他钱；他们说他是一条小懒狗，不应得到任何东西。农夫们威胁说要放出狗来追他。他站在小酒店外面时，酒店老板也要赶他走，因为他们认为他是来偷东西的。只有两个好心人给了他东西吃：一位老妇和一个路上的看门人。如果不是他们给他东西吃，他肯定会像他母亲一样死去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked twenty miles that day. The only thing he had to eat was his piece of bread and some water which he begged from houses near the road. He slept the first night in a field, feeling lonely, tired, cold and hungry. He was even hungrier the next morning when he woke up, and he had to buy some more bread with his penny. That day he walked only twelve miles. His legs were so weak that They shook beneath him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天，他走了二十英里，只吃了身边的那块面包，喝了点儿从路边人家讨来的水。第一天晚上他睡在了野地里，孤单、疲劳、寒冷、饥饿一起向他袭来。第二天早晨醒来，他更加饥饿难耐，不得不拿出仅有的一便士买了点儿面包。这一天他只走了十二英里，他的两条腿软弱无力，不停地瑟瑟发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But after only four miles he began to realize just how far he would have to walk. He stopped to think about it.

<div class="line_cn" title="但是刚刚走了四英里，他已开始意识到他还有多么长的路要走。他停下脚步，想了想这件事。他身边有一块面包、一件粗布衫、两双袜子和一便士。他看不出这些东西怎么能帮他更快地到达伦敦。于是，他继续往前走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Early on the seventh morning of his journey, Oliver finally reached the little town of Barnet, just outside London. Exhausted, he sat down at the side of the road. His feet were bleeding and he was covered in dust. He was too tired even to beg. Then he noticed that a boy, who had passed him a few minutes before, had returned, and was now looking at him carefully from the opposite side of the road. After a long time the boy crossed the road and said to Oliver,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在旅途的第七天清早，奥利弗终于到达了伦敦附近一个叫巴尼特的小镇子。他精疲力竭地坐在路边，两只脚流着血，浑身上下沾满了尘土。由于过度疲劳，他连乞讨的劲儿都没有了，这时，他注意到有一个男孩几分钟之前从他身边走过，这会儿又折了回来，站在马路的对面仔细打量着他。过了好一会儿，这男孩穿过马路，向他走来，说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy was about Oliver's age, but was one of the strangest-looking people he had ever seen. He had a dirty, ordinary boy's face, but he behaved as if he were an adult. He was short for his age and had little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on top of his head but it looked as though it would blow off at any minute. He wore a man's coat which reached almost down to his feet, with sleeves so long that his hands were completely covered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这男孩跟奥利弗年龄相仿，但奥利弗从未见过像他这样样子奇怪的人。他长着一张普通男孩的肮脏的脸，可他的一举一动跟大人一样。他比实际年龄要矮一点儿，一双贼溜溜的眯缝眼很难看。他的帽子就搁在脑袋顶上，看上去随时有可能被风吹掉。他身上穿了一件大人的外衣，衣服几乎拖到了脚背上。衣袖很长，几乎将他的两只手全盖在里面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver was deeply grateful for this offer of shelter and talked for a long time with his new friend. His name was Jack Dawkins, but he was usually called "The Artful Dodger". "Artful" because he was very clever at getting what he wanted; and "Dodger" because he was very good at not getting caught when he did something wrong. When he heard this, Oliver felt rather doubtful about having such a friend. However, he wanted first to meet the kind old gentleman in London, who would help him. After that, he could decide whether to continue the friendship with the Artful Dodger.</div>
