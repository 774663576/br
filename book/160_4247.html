<div class="line_en">"Surely you are not remembering clearly," I said. "I think you wrote to him on the day that he died. And your letter said: Please, please, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您肯定没记清楚，”我说道。“我认为您在他临终的那天曾给他写过信。您的信中还是这么写的：‘请您千万将此信烧掉，并在10点钟的时候到栅门那里去。‘”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have no contact with my father," she said. " He gave me no help when I was in trouble. Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind people helped me when I was poor and hungry."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," she said. "Why should I be ashamed of writing to him? I wanted him to help me. I learned that he was going to London early on the following day, so I asked him to meet me before he went. I could not go to the Hall earlier that day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我写过，”她说道。“我为何要为曾写信给他而感到羞愧呢？我本想让他帮助我。我听说他第二天一大早就要到伦敦去。那天我又不能早一点到庄园去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Lyons thought for a moment, and then she said: "I see that I must tell you. Perhaps you know that I married a man who was very cruel to me. I hate him and I wanted to get a divorce. But a divorce is expensive, and I had no money. I thought that if Sir Charles heard my sad story, he would help me to get a divorce."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱昂丝太太斟酌了片刻，接着说道：“我看来得告诉您了。您也许知道我嫁给了一个对我非常残酷的男子。我恨他，我曾想与他离婚。可是离婚是桩昂贵的事情，而我又没有什么钱。我当时觉得，要是查尔斯爵士听到了我那悲惨的故事的话，他就会帮助我离婚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because I got help from someone else," she said.</div>

<div class="line_en">I asked Mrs Lyons a number of other questions, but she did not change her story, whatever I asked her. I was sure that she was telling the truth. I could check two important parts of the story. If they were right, there could be no doubt that she was telling the truth. I could check that she had begun to get her divorce at about the time of Sir Charles death. I could also check that she had not been to Baskerville Hall on the night of Sir Charles death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我问了莱昂丝太太许多别的问题，但是她不管我怎么问都不肯改口。我敢保证她讲了实话。我可以验证一下她的叙述中关键的两点。如果这两处正确无误，那么无疑她是在讲真话。我可以调查一下，看看她在查尔斯爵士逝去之时是否真的开始为离婚而忙乎着。我还可以调查一下，看看她是否在查尔斯爵士逝去的当晚真的没去巴斯克维尔庄园。">查看中文翻译</div>
