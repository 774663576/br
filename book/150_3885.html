<div class="line_en">Her heart beat a little faster as she remembered the way in which that white china knob slowly turned. They mustn't take risks like that again. It was better to go to the curio shop. No one who saw her go in would think anything of it, and they were absolutely safe there. The owner of the shop knew who Charlie was and he was not such a fool as to put up the back of the Assistant Colonial Secretary. What did anything matter really but that Charlie loved her?</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned away from the verandah and went back into her sitting-room. She threw herself down on the sofa and stretched out her hand to get a cigarette. Her eye caught sight of a note lying on the top of a book. She opened it. It was written in pencil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她转过身离开走廊，回到自己的起居室。她躺到沙发上，伸手去取一支烟。她看见有本书上放着一张纸条。她打开纸条，上面用铅笔写着几行字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It couldn't have been Walter that afternoon. It must have been one of the servants and after all they didn't matter. Chinese servants knew everything anyway. But they held their tongues.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then it had been Walter. She rang up the Colonial Secretary's office at once and asked for Charlie. She told him what she had just learned. There was a pause before he answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看来是瓦尔特了。她立即打电话给布政司办公室，要查理接电话。她告诉他刚刚得到的情况。他稍微停顿了一会儿，没有回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She rang the bell and when the boy came asked him who had brought the book and when. "Master bring it, missy, after tiffin," he answered.</div>

<div class="line_en">She sat down again, at a desk, and resting her face in her hands sought to think out the situation. Of course Walter might merely have thought she was sleeping: there was no reason why she should not lock herself in. She tried to remember if they had been talking. Certainly they had not been talking loud. And there was the hat. It was maddening of Charlie to have left it downstairs. But it was no use blaming him for that, it was natural enough, and there was nothing to tell that Walter had noticed it. He was probably in a hurry and had just left the book and note on his way to some appointment: connected with his work. The strange thing was that he should have tried the door and then the two windows. If he thought she was asleep it was unlike him to disturb her. What a fool she had been!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她重新坐在书桌旁边，手托着脸，竭力思考着目前的境况。完全有可能是瓦尔特以为她睡着了，这样她当然有理由把门窗锁起来。她拼命回想他们有没有说过话。他们肯定没大声说话。还有那顶帽子，查理真是疯了把它忘在楼下。但是怪他也没用，换了谁都没准会忘。况且瓦尔特发没发现也很难说。他大概已经和人约好，正赶着去忙工作上的事，把书和纸条搁下就走了。那个旋钮的事可能是他先想开门，然后又去开两扇窗户。他猜她睡着了，就没打搅她。她多笨呢！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She put down the receiver. She understood that he was not alone and she was impatient with his business.</div>

<div class="line_en">She shook herself a little and again she felt that sweet pain in her heart which she always felt when she thought of Charlie. It had been worth it. He had said that he would stand by her, and if the worse came to the worse, well… Let Walter kick up a row if he chose. She had Charlie; what did she care? Perhaps it would be the best thing for him to know. She had never cared for Walter and since she had loved Charlie Townsend it had irked and bored her to submit to her husband's caresses. She wanted to have nothing more to do with him. She didn't see how he could prove anything. If he accused her she would deny, and if it came to a pass that she could deny no longer, well, she would fling the truth in his teeth, and he could do what he chose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的身体颤抖了一下，心思又回到了查理身上，她又感觉到了那股甜蜜又疼痛的滋味。这是值得的。他说过他会保护她，要是事情越来越糟，那……瓦尔特要闹就让他闹好了。她有查理，还在乎别的么？他知道了可能倒最好。她从未关心过瓦尔特，自从爱上查理·唐生以后，再让她忍受丈夫的亲吻简直就是活受罪。她不想和他再有任何瓜葛。她看他根本抓不住什么把柄。要是他诬陷她，她就矢口否认。要是实在隐瞒不下去了，她就一骨脑把真相和盘托出，他爱怎么着就怎么着。">查看中文翻译</div>
