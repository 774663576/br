<div class="line_en">Her night was tortured with strange dreams. She seemed to be carried in her chair and she felt the swaying motion as the bearers marched with their long, uneven stride. She entered cities, vast and dim, where the multitude thronged about her with curious eyes. The streets were narrow and tortuous and in the open shops, with their strange wares, all traffic stopped as she went by and those who bought and those who sold, paused. Then she came to the memorial arch and its fantastic outline seemed on a sudden to gain a monstrous life; its capricious contours were like the waving arms of a Hindu god, and, as she passed under it, she heard the echo of mocking laughter. But then Charlie Townsend came towards her and took her in his arms, lifting her out of the chair, and said it was all a mistake, he had never meant to treat her as he had, for he loved her and he couldn't live without her. She felt his kisses on her mouth and she wept with joy, asking him why he had been so cruel, but though she asked she knew it did not matter. And then there was a hoarse, abrupt cry and they were separated, and between, hurrying silently, coolies passed in their ragged blue and they bore a coffin.</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning drew on and the sun touched the mist so that it shone whitely like the ghost of snow on a dying star. Though on the river it was light so that you could discern palely the lines of the crowded junks and the thick forest of their masts, in front it was a shining wall the eye could not pierce. But suddenly from that white cloud a tall, grim, and massive bastion emerged. It seemed not merely to be made visible by the all-discovering sun but rather to rise out of nothing at the touch of a magic wand. It towered, the stronghold of a cruel and barbaric race, over the river. But the magician who built worked swiftly and now a fragment of coloured wall crowned the bastion; in a moment, out of the mist, looming vastly and touched here and there by a yellow ray of sun, there was seen a cluster of green and yellow roofs. Huge they seemed and you could make out no pattern; the order, if order there was, escaped you; wayward and extravagant, but of an unimaginable richness. This was no fortress, nor a temple, but the magic palace of some emperor of the gods where no man might enter. It was too airy, fantastic, and unsubstantial to be the work of human hands; it was the fabric of a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色越来越亮，阳光照射到了那层薄雾上，使之闪闪发光，好像是一颗濒临死亡的恒星周围弥漫的云状物。河面上的雾气已经很轻，所以能够大致分辨出拥挤的舢板的轮廓和它们多如密林的桅杆。但再过去一点，除了一道耀眼的雾墙，还是什么也看不清。恰在此时一座宏伟的城堡从云雾缭绕中赫然显露出来。与其说它是在普照万物的阳光中现出真容，不如说是被魔棒一点，从无到有生发而出。它像凶神恶煞一般高高矗立在河的对岸。然而创造它的魔术师并未就此罢手，他魔棒一挥，城堡上方随即呈现出一道彩墙。开始它还在雾霭中时隐时现，在金色的阳光的照射下，渐渐露出了翠绿和金黄的顶盖。这些好似庞然大物的顶盖似乎不拘泥于某种即成的建筑式样，它们零散随意地彼此搭连在一起，很难说是井井有条。然而在不成规矩之中，却也颇具韵味。你很难称这座凌驾于城堡之上的建筑为堡垒或者庙宇，它俨然应是一座众神之王御临的宫殿，绝非凡人可以踏足。它如此神奇、虚幻、缥缈，远非凡人之手所能开凿。它理应是梦之杰作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bungalow stood half way down a steep hill and from her window she saw the narrow river below her and opposite, the city. The dawn had just broken and from the river rose a white mist shrouding the junks that lay moored close to one another like peas in a pod. There were hundreds of them, and they were silent, mysterious in that ghostly light, and you had a feeling that their crews lay under an enchantment, for it seemed that it was not sleep, but something strange and terrible, that held them so still and mute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座房子坐落在半山腰，从她的窗户可以望见那条小河，以及河对岸的城镇。刚刚破晓，河面上浮起了一层白雾，罩住了密密麻麻挤在一起、活像扁豆粒的小舢板。这些小船足有好几百条，在薄雾中一动不动。它们给你一种感觉，似乎它们不是安然沉睡在河面上，而是受到某种陌生而可怕的力量的控制，才会如此沉寂。而此时此刻，船夫们已被下了魔咒，酣睡于舱底。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tears ran down Kitty's face and she gazed, her hands clasped to her breast and her mouth, for she was breathless, open a little. She had never felt so light of heart and it seemed to her as though her body were a shell that lay at her feet and she pure spirit. Here was Beauty. She took it as the believer takes in his mouth the wafer which is God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼泪从凯蒂的脸上流了下来，她眺望着它，双手搂在胸前，嘴唇微微张开着，已然忘记了呼吸。她还从未有过如此神思飞扬的感受，她觉得她的身体此时只是一具空壳，而她的灵魂在荡涤之后纯净无瑕。这就是美。她相信这就是美，就像享用圣餐的基督徒信仰上帝一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
