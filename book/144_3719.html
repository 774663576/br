<div class="line_en">Senator wavven had great news, and it would cost the Clericuzio five million dollars. So said Giorgio's courier. That demanded a mountain of paperwork. Cross would have to extract five million from the casino cage and leave a long record to account for its disappearance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross started on the paperwork for the transfer of the five million dollars to Senator Wavven. The cash itself would have too much bulk for a suitcase or large overnight bag. He called the Hotel gift shop; he remembered an antique Chinese trunk for sale that was big enough to hold the money. It was dark green decorated with red dragons and superimposed false green gems, and it had a strong locking mechanism.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了把五百万交给维文参议员，克罗斯开始做账。这笔钱数额太大，手提箱和大号的旅行袋都装不下。他给酒店的礼品店打了个电话，那里卖的中式老款旅行箱可以装得下那么多钱。这款箱子漆成深绿色，画有红色的龙纹，镶了人造绿宝石，装着特别牢靠的锁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was also a call from Lia Vazzi in the Hunting Lodge. He requested to see Cross personally as soon as possible. He did not have to say it was urgent, any request from him had to be urgent or he would not call, and he was already on his way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gronevelt had taught him how to make the paper trail that legitimized money skimmed from the Hotel casino.

<div class="line_en">Cross was enraged that Vail would dare to speak that way in front of Claudia. Luckily, at that moment room service arrived with their rolling tables and set dinner up in the living room. Cross controlled himself as they sat down to eat, but he couldn't help saying, with a cold smile, "Ernest, you can solve everything if you knock yourself off, as I understand it. Maybe I can help. I'll move your suite up to the tenth floor and you can just step out the window."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯被维尔激怒了，他竟敢在克劳迪娅面前说这种话。幸好，就在这个时候，服务员推着小车送来客房服务，在起居室准备好了晚餐。他们坐下吃饭时，克罗斯控制了一下情绪，但还是忍不住冷笑道：“厄内斯特，你只要一死，所有问题都解决了。这点我倒可以帮你，不如我把你的套房挪到十楼，你只要从窗户跳下去就可以了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this, Vail took an interest. He said, "Claudia, you dumbbell, don't you understand about your brother? If he asks somebody for something and they say no, then he has to kill them." He gave Cross a big grin.</div>

I'm too chicken to cut my wrists, I can't stand the sight of blood and I'm scared to death of guns and knives and traffic. I don't want to end up a vegetable with nothing accomplished.

<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯起身坐回办公桌前。他打开抽屉的锁，拿出一袋黑色筹码。他把袋子丢给厄内斯特说：“这里是一万块。最后赌一回吧，说不定有好运气。别再当着我妹妹的面侮辱我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
