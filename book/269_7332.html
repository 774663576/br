<div class="line_en">When they appeared, striding out from between the trees, they weren't what I was expecting. I'd gotten the image of the wolves stuck in my head. These were just four really big half-naked boys.</div>

<div class="line_en">Again, they reminded me of brothers, quadruplets. Something about the way they moved almost in synchronization to stand across the road from us, the way they all had the same long, round muscles under the same red-brown skin, the same cropped black hair, and the way their expressions altered at exactly the same moment.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam was still the biggest, though Jacob was getting close to catching up with him. Sam didn't really count as a boy. His face was older -- not in the sense of lines or signs of aging, but in the matunry, the patience of his expression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆仍是他们中最魁梧的一个，尽管雅各布就快要和他差不多了。山姆其实不算是男孩儿，他看上去更成熟——倒不是指他脸上刻有岁月的痕迹，而是他的神色中带有几分稳重和镇静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“保罗！”山姆和雅各布同时叫道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With another sharp tearing sound, Jacob exploded, too. He burst out of his skin -- shreds of black and white cloth blasted up into the air. It happened so quickly that if I'd blinked, I'd have missed the entire transformation. One second it was Jacob diving into the air, and then it was the gigantic, russet brown wolf -- so enormous that I couldn't make sense of its mass somehow fitting inside Jacob -- charging the crouched silver beast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又传来了一声刺耳的爆裂，雅各布也变身了。他的皮肤一寸寸裂开——黑色和白色的衣服碎片散落在空中。他的转变太快了，似乎我眨眨眼就会错过这一切。前一秒钟他还是奔跑着的雅各布，现在却变成了一匹巨大的红棕色的狼——我实在搞不清雅各布的身体里怎么可能容下这样一个庞然大物——他和那匹蹲伏着的灰狼相互对峙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Take her to Emily's," Sam shouted toward the other boys, who were watching the conflict with rapt expressions. Jacob had successfully shoved the gray wolf off the road, and they were disappearing into the forest, though the sound of their snarls was still loud. Sam ran after them, kicking off his shoes on the way. As he darted into the trees, he was quivering from head to toe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“带她去艾米丽那儿。”山姆朝另两个男孩儿叫道，他们正出神地看着眼前的搏斗。雅各布成功地将灰狼推进森林，他们消失在树丛之中，但愤怒的咆哮声依然清晰。山姆踢掉脚上的鞋，跟着他们跑了进去。奔入树林的那一刻，他从头到脚都在颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stay where you are, Bella," Sam ordered. It was hard to hear him over the roar of the fighting wolves. They were snapping and tearing at each other, their sharp teeth flashing toward each other's throats. The Jacob-wolf seemed to have the upper hand -- he was visibly bigger than the other wolf, and it looked like le was stronger, too. He rammed his shoulder against the gray wolf again and again, knocking him back toward the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“站在那儿别动，贝拉。”山姆命令道。在两只狼的搏斗下，我几乎听不清他在说什么。他们互相咬扯，锋利的牙齿直冲对方的颈项咬去。雅各布变成的那只狼似乎占了上风——他比起另一只狼来更高大，看上去也更壮实。他不断用肩胛猛撞那只灰狼，想把对手撞进森林里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The black and white scraps -- the remains of Jacob's clothes -- fluttered to the ground where he'd disappeared.</div>
