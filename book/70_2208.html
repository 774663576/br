<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine looked around the room, her gaze flitting from the chairs to the pictures on the wall. In turn, Ella watched Lady Tremaine. She knew that the woman was judging the house and, therefore, her mother's touch. Finally, Lady Tremaine answered, "Very homely." While her smile seemed approving, Ella couldn't help noting the dual meanings of the word. Her stepmother went on. "It does lack a little sparkle and gaiety. Though I suppose there has been little enough to celebrate… until now. We must change that!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人环视了一下房间，她的眼睛从椅子扫视到墙上挂的画。瑞拉也注视着特曼妮夫人。她知道特曼妮夫人在评判这所房子，也是在评判母亲的品位。最后，特曼妮夫人答道：“很有家的样子。”尽管她的微笑看起来像赞许，但瑞拉忍不住想到这个词的双重意思。继母继续说道：“房子缺少一点光彩和活力。当然，之前好像也没什么好庆祝的…直到今天。我们要让它焕然一新！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine wasted no time in planning many parties. She invited everyone she thought worthy, including numerous well-dressed lords and ladies. The household staff found themselves stuffed into formal servants' outfits while the cook baked and grilled and baked some more. As the guests began to arrive, the house did indeed fill with laughter. But, Ella noted as she looked around the room, the laughter was not kind. It was snarky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人马上就开始筹备一个接一个的派对。她邀请了所有她认为值得邀请的人，包括很多衣冠楚楚的王公和贵妇。家里的仆人们穿上了正式的工作服，厨师烘啊、烤啊，忙得不可开交。随着客人们陆陆续续地到来时，屋子里确实是充满了笑声。但是瑞拉环顾四周却发现，他们的笑声并不友善，它是那么的刺耳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she spoke, Lady Tremaine looked directly at Ella. If Ella were to disagree, it would seem rude, and Ella knew her father would be hurt. So she simply nodded. While she liked the house, it might not be such a bad idea to bring some life back into the place, add a little more laughter. What harm could come from that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人说话的时候眼睛直盯着瑞拉。如果瑞拉表示拒绝，看起来会很不礼貌，而且她知道那样父亲也会难过。所以瑞拉只是点了点头。她喜欢这所房子，给这房子重新带来一点生气，增添一点欢笑，应该也不是坏事。会有什么坏处呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella watched as her stepmother and her guests speculated on the goings-on in the kingdom, cackling meanly as they gossiped. Then, noticing movement out of the corner of her eye, Ella glanced to the side of the room. She smiled as she saw a tiny house mouse, whom she had named Jacqueline, making off with a fallen chunk of cheese. The food was nearly as big as the mouse herself, and she struggled under its weight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉看着继母和她的客人们猜测着王国里的各种动向，不时爆发出刺耳的笑声。瑞拉眼睛的余光注意到有什么东西在移动，就向屋子那边一瞥。原来是一只小家鼠，瑞拉给它取名叫杰奎琳。看到杰奎琳在偷偷抱走一块落到地上的奶酪，瑞拉笑了。奶酪差不多和小老鼠一样大，小老鼠被压得步履维艰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么不去参加聚会？”瑞拉说着走进了书房。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, Ella heard a hiss. Lady Tremaine's beloved cat, Lucifer, was stalking over. The name fit the creature perfectly. He was the one animal Ella had not been able to win over. He was mean and aloof, showing affection only to Lady Tremaine and snapping at anyone else who dared to come near him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，瑞拉听到嘶的一声，是特曼妮夫人心爱的猫卢西佛悄悄跟了过来。这只猫叫卢西佛还真叫对了。它是唯一对瑞拉不友好的动物。它刻薄冷漠，除了对特曼妮夫人亲近以外，其他任何人只要一走近，它就会又咬又挠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just what do you think you're up to, Lucifer?" Ella asked, reaching down and picking up the cat by the scruff of his neck. "Jacqueline is my guest. And the eating of guests is not allowed." Nodding at the little mouse, Ella took Lucifer out of the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're hardly back from the last trip," Ella said, her voice quavering. "Do you have to go?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是你才出差回来啊，”瑞拉用颤抖的声音说，“你必须去吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="父亲抬起头说：“这个要求真奇怪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella returned the smile. This was one of the games they played: identify the quote. When she was younger, the quotes had been simple, but now her father enjoyed testing her with more obscure references. This one, however, she knew. "King Lear." Her father nodded proudly. Suddenly, inspiration struck. "I know," she said. "Bring me the first branch your shoulder brushes on your journey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉也朝父亲笑了笑。这是他们玩的一个游戏：猜出引用句子的出处。她小的时候，句子都很简单，但是现在父亲喜欢用更隐晦的引文考她。然而，这一句话她知道：“《李尔王》。”父亲骄傲地点点头。瑞拉突然有了灵感。“想起来了，”她说，“给我带旅途中第一个划过你肩头的树枝吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'll have to take it with you on your way," Ella explained, "and think of me when you look at it. And when you bring it back, it means that you will be with it." Her face grew serious as she looked at her father. He seemed smaller to her, weaker even. She knew that each trip he made took a toll on him. "And that's what I really want -- for you to come back. No matter what." She shuddered as a wave of foreboding washed over her. She had a terrible feeling, as if her father wasn't coming home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样你一路上就要带着它，”瑞拉解释说，“一看到它你就会想起我。等你把它带回来时，就说明它陪了你一路。”她看着父亲，表情变得严肃起来。父亲显得没有那么高大了，甚至有点虚弱。她知道每次奔波都会让父亲心力交瘁。“这才是我真正想要的——你要回来，无论发生什么事情。”她突然有一种不祥的预感，浑身战栗了一下。她难受极了，仿佛父亲再不能回来了似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm afraid so," her father replied. "And what would you like me to bring you home from abroad? Your sisters…" His voice trailed off as Ella shot him a pointed look. He cleared his throat and corrected himself. "Your stepsisters have asked me for parasols and lace. What will you have?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕必须去，”父亲回答，“你想让我从国外给你带什么回来？你姐姐们…”瑞拉瞪了父亲一眼，他的声音小了。他清了清嗓子，改口道：“你的继姐们让我买阳伞和蕾丝。你要什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shaking her head, Lady Tremaine turned and walked back down the hall. It was pointless to allow emotion to get the better of her. She was the lady of the house now, and she would make sure Ella learned that while her father was away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人摇摇头，转身沿着走廊离开了。让自己失去理智没有什么意义。她现在是房子的女主人，她要让瑞拉在父亲出差时明白这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you," her father said, sounding relieved. "I always leave a part of me behind, Ella. Remember that. And your mother is here, too, though you see her not. She is the very heart of this place. That is why we must cherish this house, always. For her."</div>

<div class="line_en">All too soon, Ella once again found herself standing in front of the house looking at a carriage. But this time the carriage was not bringing a new family home to her; it was taking her only real family away. As her father waved good-bye, Ella's eyes filled with tears. Lady Tremaine stood beside her, her back straight and her expression unreadable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，瑞拉又一次站在房前看着一辆马车。但这一次马车不是带来新的家庭成员，而是要带走她唯一真正的亲人。父亲挥手道别时，瑞拉热泪盈眶。特曼妮夫人站在瑞拉身边，腰挺得笔直，脸上透露着一种难以捉摸的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine was seated comfortably on one of the chaises. Her hands were clasped in her lap, and a look of smug pleasure spread over her face. From down the hall, Ella could hear her stepsisters arguing about clothes and closet space. "Yes, Stepmother."</div>

"Anastasia and Drisella have always shared a room. Such dear, affectionate girls. I think they are finding the quarters rather confining."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人冷冷地笑了一下。“你不用这么称呼我，”她回答，“叫我‘夫人’就行。”她稍微停了一下，因为她的一个女儿尖叫了一声，然后接着说道：“安泰西亚和崔西里亚一直挤在一个房间里。她们真是难舍难分。我看她们是觉得自己的房间太局促了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella listened to the screaming from the hall. She couldn't argue with her stepmother. Her new sisters did seem on edge.

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉听到走廊上传来的尖叫声。她不能跟继母争辩。两个姐姐看起来的确挺剑拔弩张的。她答应过父亲要和她们友好相处。“我的卧室是主卧以外最大的，也许她们愿意住我那间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stopping to collect a few things from her old room, she made her way up to the attic. When she opened the door, she was met with a gust of cold, dusty air. No one had been up there in years, and cobwebs hung from the ceiling, while a thick layer of dust coated the floor. Various objects were strewn about, having been dumped into the attic when they were no longer of use. Just like me, Ella thought. She spotted a narrow, beat-up bed in the corner and moved it under the single window. Then she sat down. "Well," she said aloud, trying to make the best of it, "no one shall disturb me here."</div>

They complained that the country air exhausted them, so, in order to help the staff with the Tremaines' increasing demands, Ella began taking breakfast to their rooms every morning. Soon their lethargy started to extend through supper, tea, and dinner as well. The bells in the kitchen that had long been covered by dust through lack of use began to ring throughout the day, signaling yet more requests from Ella's stepfamily.</div>

<div class="line_en">While Anastasia and Drisella lounged, Ella rushed to and fro, picking up empty plates and clearing the dirty laundry only to watch her sisters carelessly throw more clothes on the ground. When the girls and their mother retired to the drawing room for the afternoon, Ella was expected to make sure the dust was wiped clear and the curtains were pulled back to let in the sun. There was always a complaint. A smidge of dust, the sun too bright.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perched in her chair, Lady Tremaine watched her stepdaughter rush to and fro. Despite her dirty dress and her messy hair, she was still infinitely more poised than either of Lady Tremaine's daughters. She did what she was asked, always agreeably, always willingly, and it infuriated Lady Tremaine. The lady realized that if she wanted her daughters to look better, she would simply have to make Ella look worse. She would have to figure out a way to extinguish the light of Ella's good character -- at any cost.</div>
