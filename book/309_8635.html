<div class="line_en">On the ration cards of Nazi Germany, there was no listing for punishment, but everyone had to take their turn. For some it was death in a foreign country during the war. For others it was poverty and guilt when the war was over, when six million discoveries were made throughout Europe. Many people must have seen their punishments coming, but only a small percentage welcomed it. One such person was Hans Hubermann.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, his punishment was conscience. His oblivious unearthing of Max Vandenburg plagued him. Liesel could see it sitting next to his plate as he ignored his dinner, or standing with him at the bridge over the Amper. He no longer played the accordion. His silver-eyed optimism was wounded and motionless. That was bad enough, but it was only the beginning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，他的惩罚是良心不安。没有找到马克斯·范登堡令他寝食难安。连莉泽尔都能看出爸爸不太对劲，因为他总是坐在餐桌旁，却不吃饭，还常常在安珀河上望着桥下的倒影。他再也不拉手风琴了。他银色眼眸中的乐观因为受挫而暗淡无光。你也许以为这已经够糟糕的了，但惩罚才刚刚开始。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the shell-shocked kitchen, somewhere near the stove, there's an image of a lonely, overworked typewriter. It sits in a distant, near-empty room. Its keys are faded and a blank sheet waits patiently upright in the assumed position. It wavers slightly in the breeze from the window. Coffee break is nearly over. A pile of paper the height of a human stands casually by the door. It could easily be smoking.</div>
