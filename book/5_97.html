<div class="line_en">Over the course of their senior year in high school, they'd become a pair. TullyandKate. Everyone at school said their two names as one. When Tully became editor of the school paper, Kate was right beside her, helping her to edit the stories. She lived vicariously through her friend's achievements, rode the wave of her popularity, but all of that had taken place in a world she knew, in a place where she felt safe.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the creaky attic bedroom, Kate stood at the edge of her twin bed, staring down at the open suitcase that contained all of her prized belongings. A framed picture of her grandparents lay on top, wedged between her ribbon-wrapped packet of long-ago letters from Tully and a photo of her and Tully taken at graduation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在老旧的阁楼卧房中，凯蒂站在单人床前望着打开的行李箱，里面装着她所有的宝贝。最上面是祖父母的照片，两边夹着很久以前塔莉写给她的信，以及她们俩在毕业典礼上的合照。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although she'd been looking forward to this moment for months (she and Tully had spun endless late-night dreams, all of which began with the words when we're in college), now that it was here, she felt reluctant to leave home.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They'll want you," Kate said softly, and for the first time in months she felt like the girl they'd called Kootie all those years ago, the girl in the Coke-bottle glasses and high-water Sears jeans.

<div class="line_cn" title="“她们会抢着要你。”凯蒂轻声说，几个月来第一次，她觉得自己变回了矬蒂，戴着厚镜片眼镜，牛仔裤不但廉价而且太短。即使现在她戴隐形眼镜、脱离牙套，学会以化妆手法勾勒五官，但那些姐妹会的女生绝对会看穿她的真面目。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Remember Firefly Lane?" Tully said, lowering her voice. Over the years those words had become a catchall phrase, a kind of shorthand for their memories. It was their way of saying that a friendship begun at fourteen, back when David Cassidy was groovy and a song could make you cry, would last forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“记得萤火虫巷吗？”塔莉放低声音说。这些年来，这句话成为一句暗号，代表她们之间所有的回忆。她们借这句话表明十四岁那年开始的友谊将持续到永远，她们结交的时候戴维·卡西迪[39]还很红，歌曲还能让人流泪。【注：[39]戴维·卡西迪（David Cassidy）：美国歌手、演员及作曲家，20世纪70年代青春偶像，曾演出家庭喜剧《欢乐满人间》（The Patridge Family）。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The University of Washington was everything Tully had hoped it would be and more. Spread out over several miles and comprised of hundreds of gothic buildings, it was a world unto itself. The size daunted Kate, but not Tully; she figured if she could triumph here, she could triumph anywhere. From the moment they moved into their sorority, she began preparing for a reporting job at the networks. In addition to taking the core classes in communications, she made time to read at least four newspapers a day and watch as many newscasts as possible. When her big break came, she was going to be ready.</div>
