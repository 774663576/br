<div class="line_en">Albert Kennedy, Bert to people he liked, lived in a room at the back of the house, and was one of Mrs. Cooper's original lodgers. He was forty-five, a native of San Francisco, and more like a New Yorker than anyone Therese had met in the town, and this fact alone inclined her to avoid him. Often he asked Therese to go to the movies with him, but she had gone only once. She was restless and she preferred to wander about by herself, mostly just looking and thinking, because the days were too cold and windy for any outdoor sketching. And the scenes she had liked at first had grown too stale to sketch, from too much looking, too much waiting. Therese went to the library almost every evening, sat at one of the long tables looking over half a dozen books, and then took a meandering course homeward.</div>

<div class="line_en">She came back to the house only to wander out again after a while, stiffening herself against the erratic wind, or letting it turn her down streets she would not otherwise have followed. In the lighted windows she would see a girl seated at a piano, in another a man laughing, in another a woman sewing. Then he remembered she could not even call Carol, admitted to herself she did not even know what Carol was doing at this moment, and she felt emptier than the wind. Carol did not tell her everything in her letters, she felt, did not tell her the worst.</div>

<div class="line_en">And there was the beautiful thing, transfixing the heart and the eyes at once, in the dark window of an antique shop in a street where she had never been. Therese stared at it, feeling it quench some forgotten and nameless thirst inside her. Most of its porcelain surface was painted with small bright lozenges of colored enamel, royal blue and deep red and green, outlined with coin gold as shiny as silk embroidery, even under its film of dust. There was a gold ring at the rim for the finger. It was a tiny candlestick holder. Who had made it, she wondered, and for whom?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有那件美丽的东西，在街上一家她没去过的古董店里阴暗的窗户边，立即震慑她的心灵和肉眼。特芮丝盯着那件东西，感觉到那件东西消弭了心里无名的、早已遗忘的渴望。这件物品的瓷质表面上用彩色亮釉漆着明亮的小小菱形图案，颜色有红、蓝、深红和绿色，轮廓则是和丝绣一样闪亮的金色，即使覆盖在一层薄薄的灰尘之下，看起来依旧美丽。旁边还放了一只金戒指。这是一个小小的蜡烛台。她想，这个蜡烛台是谁做的，又是为了谁而做的？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the library, she looked at books with photographs of Europe in them, marble fountains in Sicily, ruins of Greece in sunlight, and she wondered if she and Carol would really ever go there. There was still so much they had not done. There was the first voyage across the Atlantic. There were simply the mornings, mornings anywhere, when she could lift her head from a pillow and see Carol's face, and know that the day was theirs and that nothing would separate them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在图书馆里，她看着书里欧洲的照片，有西西里的大理石喷泉、阳光下的希腊古文明遗迹，想像自己和卡罗尔有朝一日是不是真的会到这些地方游览。她们还有很多事没做，包括两人首度横跨大西洋的旅程，还有每个早晨，不管在哪里，她从枕头上一抬起头就可以看到卡罗尔的脸，知道那天属于她们两人，没有任何事情会拆散她们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A letter from Richard had come that morning, forwarded from Colorado Springs. Therese sat down on one of the stone benches in the street where the library was, and opened it. It was on business stationery: The Semco Bottled Gas Company. Cooks -- Heats -- Makes Ice. Richard's name was at the top as General Manager of the Port Jefferson Branch.</div>

<div class="line_en">I know I had stopped loving you then, and now the uppermost emotion I feel toward you is one that was present from the first -- disgust. It is your hanging onto this woman to the exclusion of everyone else, this relationship which I am sure has become sordid and pathological by now, that disgusts me. I know that it will not last, as I said from the first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我现在对你的最大感觉，也是我一开始就对你怀抱的感觉，那就是厌恶。我厌恶你，是因为你和那女人纠缠不清，而且因此把所有人都置之不顾。我也相信你和她的关系非常病态，非常可悲。我知道你和她不会长久，我从一开始就这样说过了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have Dannie to thank for telling me where you are. You may think this letter unnecessary and perhaps it is to you. Perhaps you are still in that fog you were, when we talked that evening in the cafeteria. But I feel it is necessary to make one thing clear, and that is that I no longer feel the way I did even two weeks ago, and the letter I wrote you last was nothing but a last spasmodic effort, and I knew it was hopeless when I wrote it, and I knew you wouldn't answer and I didn't want you to.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我现在常想我们放风筝那天你问我的问题。我真希望我当时就先采取行动，不要让事情演变到不可挽回的地步，因为当时我还爱你，还愿意出力拯救你。现在我不爱你了，也不愿再出力救你了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She saw Richard's thin soft lips tensed in a straight line as they must have looked when he wrote the letter, a line that still did not keep the tiny, taut curl in the upper lip from showing-she saw his face clearly for a moment, and then it vanished with a little jolt that seemed as muffled and remote from her as the clamor of Richard's letter. She stood up, put the letter back in the envelope, and walked on. She hoped he succeeded in purging himself of her. But she could only imagine him telling other people about her with that curious attitude of passionate participation she had seen in New York before she left. She imagined Richard telling Phil as they stood some evening at the Palermo bar, imagined him telling the Kellys. She wouldn't care at all, whatever he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她可以想象理查德写这封信时，柔软的薄唇必定紧绷成一条直线，而且上唇也会产生细小的、绷紧的皱纹。顷刻间她仿佛清楚看到了他的脸，但一晃他的脸庞又消失了，已经模糊且远离；而理查德这封信带来的纷纷扰扰，现在也已经模糊而遥远了。她站起来，把信放回信封，然后继续往前走，希望理查德就这样把自己给彻底忘记算了。但她只能想象理查德用一种热切的、亟欲与人分享的奇特态度，到处去讲她的事情；这种奇特的态度，她离开纽约之前就看到过了。她想象着某天晚上理查德在帕勒摩酒吧，把她的事情讲给菲尔的那种画面，也想象着他告诉凯利一家人的画面。不管他怎么说，她可是一点都不在乎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">People still ask me about you. What do you expect me to tell them? I intend to tell them the truth. Only that way can I get it out of myself -- and I can no longer bear to carry it around with me. I have sent a few things you had at the house back to your apartment. The slightest memory or contact with you depresses me, makes me not want to touch you or anything concerned with you. But I am talking sense and very likely you are not understanding a word of it. Except maybe this: I want nothing to do with you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家还是跑来问我你的事情。你要我告诉他们什么呢？我打算把真相告诉他们，只有这样才能让我摆脱这件事，我再也无法背负这件事情了。我已经把你留在我家里的东西寄回你的公寓，如今我只要稍稍想到你，稍稍想到必须与你联系一下，都会把我弄得心情低落；一切与你相关的东西，我碰都不想碰，更不想碰你这个人。我现在可是出于理智才说这些话的，不过我认为你大概一个字也听不懂，我觉得你只能听懂以下这句话：我再也不想和你有牵连了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is only regrettable that you will be disgusted later yourself, in proportion to how much of your life you waste now with it. It is rootless and infantile, like living on lotus blossoms or some sickening candy instead of the bread and meat of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遗憾的是，这段关系结束后别人也会很厌恶你；至于他们会有多厌恶你，那就要看你现在虚掷生命到什么程度来决定了。你和她的关系既幼稚又欠缺坚固的根基，就如同仰赖没有营养的糖果或者其他东西过日子，而不吃有益生命健康的粮食一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol had written the letter in haste, had probably snatched a moment to write it, but there was a coldness in it, too, that shocked Therese. She went out and walked dazedly to the corner and dropped the letter she had written the night before into the mailbox anyway, a heavy letter with three airmail stamps on it. She might see Carol within twelve hours. The thought did not bring any reassurance. Should she leave this morning? This afternoon? What had they done to Carol? She wondered if Carol would be furious if she telephoned her, if it would precipitate some crisis into a total defeat if she did?</div>

Then her hand reached out suddenly for the letter propped against the books at the back of the desk. She hadn't seen the letter before, though it was in plain view. Therese tore it open.

<div class="line_en">I am not even going into court. This morning I was given a private showing of what Harge intended to bring against me. Yes, they have a few conversations recorded -- namely Waterloo, and it would be useless to try to face a court with this. I should be ashamed, not for myself oddly enough, but for my own child, to say nothing of not wanting you to have to appear. Everything was very simple this morning -- I simply surrendered. The important thing now is what I intend to do in the future, the lawyers said. On this depends whether I would ever see my child again, because Harge has with ease now complete custody of her. The question was would I stop seeing you (and others like you, they said!). It was not so clearly put. There were a dozen faces that opened their mouths and spoke like the judges of doomsday -- reminding me of my duties, my position, and my future. (What future have they fixed up for me? Are they going to look in on it in six months?)-- I said I would stop seeing you. I wonder if you will understand, Therese, since you are so young and never even knew a mother who cared desperately for you. For this promise, they present me with their wonderful reward, the privilege of seeing my child a few weeks of the year.</div>

Abby does not think I should send this to you, but tell you when you come. We have just had quite an argument about it. I tell her she does not know you as well as I, and I think now she does not know me as well as you in some ways, and those ways are the emotions. I am not very happy today, my sweet. I am drinking my ryes and you would tell me they depress me, I know. But I wasn't prepared for these days after those weeks with you. They were happy weeks -- you knew it more than I did. Though all we have known is only a beginning. I meant to try to tell you in this letter that you don't even know the rest and perhaps you never will and are not supposed to -- meaning destined to. We never fought, never came back knowing there was nothing else we wanted in heaven or hell but to be together. Did you ever care for me that much, I don't know. But that is all part of it and all we have known is only a beginning. And it has been such a short time. For that reason it will have shorter roots in you. You say you love me however I am and when I curse. I say I love you always, the person you are and the person you will become. I would say it in a court if it would mean anything to those people or possibly change anything, because those are not the words I am afraid of. I mean, darling, I shall send you this letter and I think you will understand why I do, why I told the lawyers yesterday I would not see you again and why I had to tell them that, and I would be underestimating you to think you could not and to think you would prefer delay.</div>

<div class="line_en">… exaggerated and at the same time minimized [she read on another page of Carol's letter]. But between the pleasure of a kiss and of what a man and woman do in bed seems to me only a gradation. A kiss, for instance, is not to be minimized, or its value judged by anyone else. I wonder do these men grade their pleasure in terms of whether their actions produce a child or not, and do they consider them more pleasant if they do. It is a question of pleasure after all, and what's the use of debating the pleasure of an ice cream cone versus a football game -- or a Beethoven quartet versus the Mona Lisa. I'll leave that to the philosophers. But their attitude was that I must be somehow demented or blind (plus a kind of regret, I thought, at the fact a fairly attractive woman is presumably unavailable to men). Someone brought "aesthetics" into the argument, I mean against me of course. I said did they really want to debate that -- it brought the only laugh in the whole show. But the most important point I did not mention and was not thought of by anyone -- that the rapport between two men or two women can be absolute and perfect, as it can never be between man and woman, and perhaps some people want just this, as others want that more shifting and uncertain thing that happens between men and women. It was said or at least implied yesterday that my present course would bring me to the depths of human vice and degeneration. Yes, I have sunk a good deal since they took you from me. It is true, if I were to go on like this and be spied upon, attacked, never possessing one person long enough so that knowledge of a person is a superficial thing -- that is degeneration. Or to live against one's grain, that is degeneration by definition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="……又夸大，又被低估。（她读着又一页卡罗尔的信）对我而言，亲吻以及男女床笫的愉悦，这两件事情之间似乎只有程度上的差别。举例而言，亲吻并不应被低估，亲吻的价值也不能被任何人所断定。我在猜想，这些男人是不是以“自己的行为能否制造出小孩”为标准，来衡量愉悦的程度呢？如果他们的行为能制造出小孩的话，他们就有可能会认为自己可以从中获得更大程度的愉悦。我现在说的，毕竟是和愉悦程度有关的问题，但如果要争辩“冰淇淋甜筒”和“足球比赛”两者之间的差别，或者贝多芬的四重奏和《蒙娜丽莎》这件作品之间，何者能够产生比较多的愉悦，那又有什么用呢？这个问题还不如留给哲学家讨论吧。但是这些男人的心态是，我这种人不知出于什么原因，不是疯了就是盲了（我想，这些男人的心里面还有一点遗憾，遗憾像我这么一个美丽的女人，男人竟然得不到），有些人会把“审美标准”加入讨论之中，我指的当然是把这个标准加诸在我的身上。我认为如果他们真的想争论这件事的话，只会引人发笑罢了。但我没有提到的一点，也是最重要的一点，更是没有任何人想到的一点就是，两个男人或两个女人间的亲密关系，是否有可能是绝对且完美的？这种绝对和完美，从来没有出现在男性与女性的关系之间。有些人要的，是否就是这种绝对而完美的关系呢？而其他人只是渴望男女之间善变又不确定的感情。昨天有人说，或至少暗示我说，我现在的所作所为会让我坠入人类邪恶和堕落的深渊。的确，自从他们把你从我身边夺走后，我就已经深深沉沦了。事实上，如果我继续这样下去，持续受到监视，持续被人攻讦，永远无法长时间拥有一个人，到头来我对其他人的认识都只是停留在表面，那样的情况才是真正的堕落。或者说堕落的本质，就是逆着自己的天性生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then she went out for a walk, restlessly, avoiding all the streets she had been in with Carol. She might have driven to another town, she thought, and stopped, half decided to go back to the car. Then she walked on, not caring, actually, where she was. She walked until she was cold, and the library was the closest place to go and get warm. She passed the diner and glanced in. Dutch saw her, and with the familiar dip of his head, as if he had to look under something to see her through the window, he smiled and waved to her. Automatically, her hand waved back, good-by, and suddenly she thought of her room in New York, with the dress still on the studio couch, and the corner of the carpet turned back.

<div class="line_cn" title="图书馆员葛拉汉姆小姐一如往常地欢迎她，但特芮丝并没有走进阅览室。今晚只有两三个人在里面，秃头的男人戴着黑框眼镜，他常坐在中间的桌子旁。以往有多少次她口袋里放着卡罗尔寄来的信，坐在那个房间里面呢？就好像卡罗尔在她身边一样。她爬上楼梯，经过二楼的历史和艺术区，往上走到她以前没去过的三楼，那里有一个看来满布灰尘的大房间，墙边有玻璃面的书橱，还有一些油画以及大理石半身像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese sat down at one of the tables, and her body relaxed with an ache. She put her head down on her arms on the table, suddenly limp and sleepy, but in the next second, she slid the chair back and stood up. She felt prickles of terror in the roots of her hair. She had been somehow pretending until this moment that Carol was not gone, that when she went back to New York, she would see Carol and everything would be, would have to be as it had been before. She glanced nervously around the room, as if looking for some contradiction, some redress. For a moment, she felt her body might shatter apart of itself, or might hurl itself through the glass of the long windows across the room. She stared at a pallid bust of Homer, the inquisitively lifted eyebrows delineated faintly by dust. She turned to the door, and for the first time noticed the picture over the lintel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝在一张桌子旁边坐下，放松身体，感到一阵疼痛。她趴在桌上，把头枕在手臂上，突然觉得全身疲软，昏昏欲睡。可下一秒钟，她又把椅子推开站起来，感觉到连发根都因为恐惧而刺痛。其实她一直都在设法假装卡罗尔还没有离开她，假装她回纽约时就会见到卡罗尔，然后所有的情况都会和以前一样，也必须和以前一样。她紧张地环顾四周，仿佛在寻找某种矛盾，某种补偿。她觉得自己的身体可能会自动碎成一片片的，或者会冲破房间对面的窗户玻璃。她看着荷马毫无生气的半身像，尘埃略微勾勒出他因好奇而扬起的眉毛线条。她转向门边，这才注意到门楣上的画像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only similar, she thought, not quite the same, not the same, but the recognition had shaken her at the core, was growing as she looked at it, and she knew the picture was exactly the same, only much larger, and she had seen it many times in the hall that led to the music room before they had taken it down when she was still small -- the smiling woman in the ornate dress of some court, the hand poised just below the throat, the arrogant head half turned, as if the painter had somehow caught her in motion so that even the pearls that hung from each ear seemed to move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她本来想，这幅画只是类似的东西，而不是原作，不是真的。可是她认出这幅画了，深深撼动了她，越看就越明白这幅画就是一模一样的那幅，只是尺寸大了不少。她小的时候就看过这件作品，它就放在通往音乐室的走廊上，后来才被搬走。画里是个微笑的女人，身穿宫廷式的华丽服饰，手就摆在脖子下方，骄傲的头半转过来，仿佛画家正好捕捉到她的动作。这么一来，她那两只耳朵下方悬垂的珍珠耳环，看来也好像在晃动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She knew the short, firmly modeled cheeks, the full coral lips that smiled at one corner, the mockingly narrowed lids, the strong, not very high forehead that even in the picture seemed to project a little over the living eyes that knew everything beforehand, and sympathized and laughed at once. It was Carol. Now in the long moment while she could not look away from it, the mouth smiled and the eyes regarded her with nothing but mockery, the last veil lifted and revealing nothing but mockery and gloating, the splendid satisfaction of the betrayal accomplished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她认出了那张被塑造得短而坚毅的脸颊，厚实的珊瑚色双唇对着角落微笑，细窄的眼睛像是在嘲弄他人。坚挺但不算很高的额头，即使在画像中看来也有点突出于活灵活现的眼睛上方，那双眼睛可以预知万事万物，可以同时散发出同情关切以及嘲弄讪笑的眼神。那就是卡罗尔。她一直盯着这幅画作，无法转离视线，而画里的那张嘴正在微笑，眼睛对她投以嘲弄的目光。最后一道面纱也揭开了，显露出嘲弄和幸灾乐祸的表情，背叛已然完成，只留全然的满足。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a shuddering gasp, Therese ran under the picture and down the stairs. In the downstairs hall, Miss Graham said something to her, an anxious question, and Therese heard her own reply like an idiot's babble, because she was still gasping, fighting for breath, and she passed Miss Graham and rushed out of the building.</div>
