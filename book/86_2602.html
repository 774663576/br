<div class="line_en">The bus stopped in every village. Tony saw green fields and small, quiet villages. Every house had a garden. The smell of the flowers came in through the open windows of the bus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公共汽车每到一个村子都会停下来。托尼看到绿色的田野和僻静的小村落。每座房子都带有花园，花香从开着的车窗透了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last the bus stopped. Tony could see a river and an old bridge. A small road ran across the bridge, through the fields and over a hill. "Come on, Tony," said his mother. They got out of the bus and walked two kilometres in the hot sun. There were white and yellow flowers at the side of the road. Tony did not know their names. He wanted to know more about them. He wanted to know more about the trees too. There were no flowers or trees in his street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后车停了下来。托尼看到一条小河和一座老旧的桥。一条小路越过小桥，穿过田野，延伸至一座小山丘的另一边。“来吧，托尼。”他的母亲说道。他们下了车，在热辣的阳光下走了两公里路。路边开着白色和黄色的花，托尼不知道它们的名字，他想更多地了解这些花，也想多了解了解那些树。在他住的那条街上，既没有花，也没有树。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tony thought about the factory and the shops. The shops were bad, but the factory was worse. When people came out of the factory in the evening their faces looked white and ill. "Nothing can be worse than that," he thought. He looked into the farmer's smiling red face. "Yes, sir," he said. "Yes, please."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托尼想了想工厂，又想了想商店。商店的情况不怎么样，可是工厂就更糟。人们晚上走出厂门的时候，一个个面色苍白，一脸病容。“没什么会比那更糟了。”他想道。他注视着农场主那张红红的笑脸，说：“是的，我愿意，先生，我愿意替您干活。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tony was happy. At the end of every day his back was tired and his legs hurt, but he slept like a baby. He ate Mrs Wood's good country food. He drank a lot of milk. Soon he needed new clothes. He sent his old clothes home for his brothers. He sent his family money, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托尼很开心。每天干完活他都会觉得背酸腿痛，但是他晚上睡得很好。他吃的是伍德太太做的可口的农家饭菜，还喝很多牛奶。旧衣服很快就穿不下了，他把旧衣服寄回家给弟弟们穿，还给家里寄钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes Tony visited his family. He enjoyed those visits, but he was always happy to leave again. "I'm a country boy now," he thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">His mother was right. Tony was a good, strong boy and he worked very hard for Mr Wood. The old farmer did not pay him much money. Tony ate his meals in the kitchen and he slept in a little room at the top of the farmhouse. But the farmer was kind to him and taught him a lot. Mr Wood had no sons. He had one daughter. Her name was Linda, and she was a year younger than Tony. Mr Wood loved Linda dearly, but he wanted a son very much. He was like a father to Tony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他母亲说得没错。托尼是个壮实的好孩子，他替伍德先生干活很卖力。老农场主给他的报酬不多。托尼在厨房里吃饭，睡在农场楼房顶层的小阁楼里。但是农场主待他很好，而且还教给他很多东西。伍德先生没有儿子，只有一个女儿，名叫琳达，比托尼小一岁。伍德先生非常宠爱琳达，但他很想要个儿子。他待托尼如同自己的亲生孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the school holidays Pip and his brother John came to the farm. Pip was seventeen and John was sixteen, but they were both still at school. Their father had a large shoe shop in the town. He wanted them to go to college and learn to be businessmen. But the boys spent all their holidays on Mr Wood's farm.</div>
