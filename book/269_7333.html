<div class="line_en">It was spring break in Forks again. When I woke up on Monday morning, I lay in bed for a few seconds absorbing that. Last spring break, I'd been hunted by a vampire, too. I hoped this wasn't some kind of tradition forming.</div>

<div class="line_en">Already I was falling into the pattern of things in La Push. I'd spent Sunday mostly on the beach, while Charlie hung out with Billy at the Blacks' house. I was supposed to be with Jacob, but Jacob had other things to do, so I wandered alone, keeping the secret from Charlie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经习惯了拉普西的生活，周日的大部分时间我都在海滩度过，查理和比利则待在布莱克家的房子里。我应该同雅各布在一起，但是雅各布有其他事情要做。我只能一个人在海滩上散步，对查理保守秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This made me brood over what Jared had said, about Jacob involving his "girlfriend." I supposed that that was exactly what it looked like from the outside. As long as Jake and I knew how it really was, I shouldn't let those kinds of assumptions bother me. And maybe they wouldn't, if I hadn't known that Jacob would have loved for things to be what they appeared. But his hand felt nice as it warmed mine, and I didn't protest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这让我想起了杰瑞德的话，他曾说过雅各布不应该把“女朋友”牵扯进来。我想，在外人看来，我们的确是男女朋友关系。只要杰克和我清楚我们之间的关系，我大可不必在意外人的看法。如果不是雅各布总喜欢叫别人误解，我也许根本不会把这件事放在心上，但是，他的手是那么的暖和，握着他的手让我感到温暖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对，想见识一下吗？简直酷毙了。”他兴奋地睁大眼睛，咧嘴大笑。他打开仪表板下的储物柜，在里面摸索了半天，掏出了一把折叠刀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I never get cold anymore. I could stand like this" -- he gestured to his bare torso --"in a snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob's face turned hopeless. "It won't be long now. There's no exact age… it just builds and builds and then suddenly --" He broke off, and it was a moment before he could speak again. "Sometimes, if you get really upset or something, that can trigger it early. But I wasn't upset about anything -- I was happy." He laughed bitterly. "Because of you, mostly. That's why it didn't happen to me sooner. Instead it just kept on building up inside me -- I was like a time bomb. You know what set me off? I got back from that movie and Billy said I looked weird. That was all, but I just snapped. And then I -- I exploded. I almost ripped his face off -- my own father!" He shuddered, and his face paled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob had promised me cliff diving, hadn't he? Just because he was unavailable, should I have to give up the distraction I needed so badly -- needed even worse because Jacob was out risking his life? Risking it, in essence, for me. If it weren't for me, Victoria would not be killing people here… just somewhere else, far away. If anything happened to Jacob, it would be my fault. That realization stabbed deep and had me jogging back up to the road toward Billy's house, where my truck waited.</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew my way to the lane that passed closest to the cliffs, but I had to hunt for the little path that would take me out to the ledge. As I followed it, I looked for turns or forks, knowing that Jake had planned to take me off the lower outcropping rather than the top, but the path wound in a thin single line toward the brink with no options. I didn't have time to find another way down -- the storm was moving in quickly now. The wind was finally beginning to touch me, the clouds pressing closer to the ground. Just as I reached the place where the dirt path fanned out into the stone precipice, the first drops broke through and splattered on my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去悬崖的近道我非常熟悉，但我还得找寻通往跳水点的小道。我摸索着，研究每一个转弯和岔口，我知道，杰克计划带我从半山腰而不是山顶跳水，但是，蜿蜒曲折的小路一直把我引到了崖顶。我没时间再返转下山了——暴风雨马上就要来临。风终于刮了起来，云层似乎抬手可及。我沿着泥路到达山顶的时候，雨水开始滴落在我脸颊。">查看中文翻译</div>
