<div class="line_en">Ghost was gone when the wildlings led their horses from the cave. Did he understand about Castle Black? Jon took a breath of the crisp morning air and allowed himself to hope. The eastern sky was pink near the horizon and pale grey higher up. The Sword of the Morning still hung in the south, the bright white star in its hilt blazing like a diamond in the dawn, but the blacks and greys of the darkling forest were turning once again to greens and golds, reds and russets. And above the soldier pines and oaks and ash and sentinels stood the Wall, the ice pale and glimmering beneath the dust and dirt that pocked its surface.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="野人们牵马出洞时，白灵已经不见。他找得到黑城堡吗？琼恩吸吸晨间清爽的空气，留给自己一线希望。东方的天空，地平线处是粉红，以上渐化为浅灰。拂晓神剑仍悬于南，剑柄那颗明亮的白星如黎明的钻石一般闪耀，下方阴暗的黑灰森林慢慢呈现出绿、金黄、红、褐等各种色彩。在士卒松、橡树、岑树、哨兵树和鱼梁木上方，矗立着绝境长城，班驳的尘土与污垢之下是闪光的白色冰墙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Magnar sent a dozen men riding west and a dozen more east, to climb the highest hills they could find and watch for any sign of rangers in the wood or riders on the high ice. The Therms carried bronze-banded warhorns to give warning should the Watch be sighted. The other wildlings fell in behind Jarl, Jon and Ygritte with the rest. This was to be the young raider's hour of glory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马格拿派十几个人骑马往东，十几个人往西，爬上能找到的最高点，以观察树林里和高墙上是否藏有游骑兵。一旦发现守夜人出没，瑟恩人就会吹响镶青铜的战号示警。其余野人随贾尔行动，琼恩和耶哥蕊特也包括在内。这将是年轻掠袭者的荣耀时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Wall was often said to stand seven hundred feet high, but Jarl had found a place where it was both higher and lower. Before them, the ice rose sheer from out of the trees like some immense cliff, crowned by wind-carved battlements that loomed at least eight hundred feet high, perhaps nine hundred in spots. But that was deceptive, Jon realized as they drew closer. Brandon the Builder had laid his huge foundation blocks along the heights wherever feasible, and hereabouts the hills rose wild and rugged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们常说长城足有七百尺高，但贾尔选的地点可谓既高且低。在他们面前，冰墙自林间笔直升起，仿如无垠峭壁，顶上是风蚀的城垛，粗看上去离头顶得有八百尺，甚至九百尺。随着逐渐靠近，琼恩意识到其中的欺骗性：当年筑城者布兰登将巨大的基石依山设置，能放哪里就放哪里，而此处峰峦起伏，高度不一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jarl had chosen to assault the stretch of ice along the ridge. Here, though the top of the Wall loomed eight hundred feet above the forest floor, a good third of that height was earth and stone rather than ice; the slope was too steep for their horses, almost as difficult a scramble as the Fist of the First Men, but still vastly easier to ascend than the sheer vertical face of the Wall itself. And the ridge was densely wooded as well, offering easy concealment. Once brothers in black had gone out every day with axes to cut back the encroaching trees, but those days were long past, and here the forest grew right up to the ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾尔企图袭击沿着山脊的一段冰墙。此处尽管墙顶高耸，离森林有八百尺，但其中三分之一强是泥土岩石而非冰雪，坡度对马匹来说太陡，比先民拳峰还难爬，但相对于完全垂直的墙面，人登上去还是相对容易的。况且山脊上布满树木，提供了很好的遮蔽。从前，黑衣兄弟们每天提斧出去砍伐越界的林木，决不让森林延伸到长城以北半里之内，但如今人手匮乏，这儿的树直长到冰墙底部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had once heard his uncle Benjen say that the Wall was a sword east of Castle Black, but a snake to the west. It was true. Sweeping in over one huge humped hill, the ice dipped down into a valley, climbed the knife edge of a long granite ridgeline for a league or more, ran along a jagged crest, dipped again into a valley deeper still, and then rose higher and higher, leaping from hill to hill as far as the eye could see, into the mountainous west.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="班扬叔叔说，长城在黑城堡以东是一把剑，以西则是一条蛇。果真如此。只见冰墙掠过一座巨山峰，接着沉入谷底，然后爬上一道匕首般锋利、绵延一里格多的花岗岩悬崖，沿参差不齐的山顶前进，随后又沉入更深的谷沟，接着再度爬升，目力所及，可见它从一山跃向另一山，深入西方腹地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And where do I stand? Jon did not know. To stay with Ygritte, he would need to become a wildling heart and soul. if he abandoned her to return to his duty, the Magnar might cut her heart out. And if he took her with him… assuming she would go, which was far from certain… well, he could scarcely bring her back to Castle Black to live among the brothers. A deserter and a wildling could expect no welcome anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms. We could go look for Gendel's children, I suppose. Though they'd be more like to eat us than to take us in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我呢？我究竟处在哪边？琼恩不知道。要跟耶哥蕊特厮守，就得全心全意当野人；如果丢下她不管，继续履行职责，也许会连累对方被马格拿掏心；而若把她带走…假设她愿意走，这点尚远不能确定…也不可能带回黑城堡，跟弟兄们一起生活。在七大王国，逃兵和野人走到哪里都不受欢迎。早知道我们当初就去找詹德尔的子孙。但他们更可能吃了我们…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day promised to be damp and cold, and damper and colder by the Wall, beneath those tons of ice. The closer they got, the more the Therms held back. They have never seen the Wall before, not even the Magnar, Jon realized. It frightens them. In the Seven Kingdoms it was said that the Wall marked the end of the world. That is true for them as well. it was all in where you stood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天将是潮湿而寒冷的一天，而在长城成吨的坚冰下则更加潮湿，更加寒冷。越是接近，队伍中的瑟恩人越是踌躇。他们从没见过长城，连马格拿都没见过，琼恩意识到，它的庞大令他们惊恐。在七大王国，人们说长城是世界的尽头。对他们而言又何尝不是？只不过说法取决于所处的位置罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Wall did not awe Jarl's raiders, Jon saw. They have done this before, every man of them. Jarl called out names when they dismounted beneath the ridge, and eleven gathered round him. All were young. The oldest could not have been more than five-and-twenty, and two of the ten were younger than Jon. Every one was lean and hard, though; they had a look of sinewy strength that reminded him of Stonesnake, the brother the Halfhand had sent off afoot when Rattleshirt was hunting them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长城丝毫没有吓倒贾尔的部下。他们每人都曾亲手越过长城。大家在山脊底部下马，贾尔喊了若干名字，便有十一人出列聚在周围。他们都很年轻，最大的不超过二十五岁，有两人甚至比琼恩还小。但个个精瘦结实，强健的模样让他想起石蛇——遭遇叮当衫穷追时，断掌派他徒步离开，不知这位弟兄此刻身在何方呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the very shadow of the Wall the wildlings made ready, winding thick coils of hempen rope around one shoulder and down across their chests, and lacing on queer boots of supple doeskin. The boots had spikes jutting from the toes; iron, for Jarl and two others, bronze for some, but most often jagged bone. Small stone-headed hammers hung from one hip, a leathern bag of stakes from the other. Their ice axes were antlers with sharpened tines, bound to wooden hafts with strips of hide. The eleven climbers sorted themselves into three teams of four; Jarl himself made the twelfth man. "Mance promises swords for every man of the first team to reach the top," he told them, his breath misting in the cold air. "Southron swords of castle-forged steel. And your name in the song he'll make of this, that too. What more could a free man ask? Up, and the Others take the hindmost!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在长城的阴影里，野人们作好准备，将卷卷粗麻绳绕在一侧肩头，斜挎过胸，然后绑上奇特的软鹿皮靴，靴子顶端有突出的尖刺——贾尔和另两人的是铁制，有一些是铜制，但多数是参差不齐的骨头。小石锤挂在臀间，一个装满铁钉、骨钉乃至兽角钉的皮袋悬于另一侧，冰斧则拿在手上，它是把磨尖鹿角用兽皮绑在木柄上制成。十一名攀登者分成三组，每组四人，贾尔本人亲自上阵，凑足十二个。“曼斯答应给爬上去的第一组每人一把新剑，”他告诉他们，呼吸在冷气中结霜，“那可是南方人的城堡里铸的钢剑。他还会把你们的名字编入歌谣。一个自由民还能要求什么呢？来吧，往上爬呀，让异鬼带走落在最后的懦夫！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Others take them all, thought Jon, as he watched them scramble up the steep slope of the ridge and vanish beneath the trees. It would not be the first time wildlings had scaled the Wall, not even the hundred and first. The patrols stumbled on climbers two or three times a year, and rangers sometimes came on the broken corpses of those who had fallen. Along the east coast the raiders most often built boats to slip across the Bay of Seals. in the west they would descend into the black depths of the Gorge to make their way around the Shadow Tower. But in between the only way to defeat the Wall was to go over it, and many a raider had. Fewer come back, though, he thought with a certain grim pride. Climbers must of necessity leave their mounts behind, and many younger, greener raiders began by taking the first horses they found. Then a hue and cry would go up, ravens would fly, and as often as not the Night's Watch would hunt them down and hang them before they could get back with their plunder and stolen women. Jarl would not make that mistake, Jon knew, but he wondered about Styr. The Magnar is a ruler, not a raider. He may not know how the game is played.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让异鬼把你们全带走，琼恩心想。他看他们爬上山脊顶端的陡坡，消失在树下。这不是野人第一次攀登长城，甚至不是一百零一次。一年里，巡逻队总有两三回无意中撞上攀爬者，发现坠落的残破尸体就更常见了。沿东海岸，掠袭者们建造小船，偷溜过东海望，进入海豹湾。在西方群山，他们潜入阴暗的大峡谷深处，绕过影子塔。但在中间，逾越长城的惟一方法是翻墙，许多掠袭者都曾干过。活着回来的却很少，他带着一丝阴郁的骄傲想。攀登之前，掠袭者们必将座骑抛下，他们中许多缺乏经验的新手过去后就立刻抢夺马匹，引发争执，消息传出，守夜人军团往往在他们来不及带着战利品和偷的女人回去之前，就将其逮捕绞首正法。贾尔不会犯这种错误，琼恩知道，但斯迪就说不准了。马格拿是君主，不是掠袭者。他不懂游戏规则。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There they are," Ygritte said, and Jon glanced up to see the first climber emerge above the treetops. It was Jarl. He had found a sentinel tree that leaned against the Wall, and led his men up the trunk to get a quicker start. The wood should never have been allowed to creep so close. They're three hundred feet up, and they haven't touched the ice itself yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧，他们在那儿，”耶哥蕊特说。琼恩抬眼，看到第一个攀登者出现在树梢之上。是贾尔。他找到一棵斜倚长城的哨兵树，便带组员顺势而上。一个不错的开局。我们不该让树延伸到此。他们已登了三百尺，却还根本没碰到冰墙呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He watched the wildling move carefully from wood to Wall, hacking out a handhold with short sharp blows of his ice axe, then swinging over. The rope around his waist tied him to the second man in line, still edging up the tree. Step by slow step, Jarl moved higher, kicking out toeholds with his spiked boots when there were no natural ones to be found. When he was ten feet above the sentinel, he stopped upon a narrow icy ledge, slung his axe from his belt, took out his hammer, and drove an iron stake into a cleft. The second man moved onto the Wall behind him while the third was scrambling to the top of the tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他注视着那精悍的野人小心翼翼地从树顶移向城墙，用冰斧短促有力地劈出一个供手抓握的口子，然后荡过去。他腰上的绳索连着第二个人，那人仍在缓缓地往树顶爬。贾尔一步步向高处前进，找不到落脚点时，就用尖刺靴踢出一个来。等他到达哨兵树上方十尺，便在一个狭窄的冰台停下，把斧子挂到腰带，取出锤子，将一根铁钉敲入一道裂缝中。第二个人也移到了城墙上，同时，第三个人正爬上树顶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other two teams had no happily placed trees to give them a leg up, and before long the Therms; were wondering whether they had gotten lost climbing the ridge. Jarl's party were all on the Wall and eighty feet up before the leading climbers from the other groups came into view. The teams were spaced a good twenty yards apart. Jarl's four were in the center. To the right of them was a team headed up by Grigg the Goat, whose long blond braid made him easy to spot from below. To the left a very thin man named Errok led the climbers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另两组没有位置合适的树木助阵，等不耐烦的瑟恩人很快就开始怀疑，认为他们迷路了。当他们的领头人出现在视野中时，贾尔那组已爬了八十尺。各组间相隔二十码。贾尔的四个人居中，右边那组由山羊格里格带领，他长长的金发辫极易辨认，左边那组的领头人非常瘦，名叫埃洛克。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the same, Jon found himself hoping that Styr's fears proved well founded. If the gods are good, a patrol will chance by and put an end to this. "No wall can keep you safe," his father had told him once, as they walked the walls of Winterfell. "A wall is only as strong as the men who defend it." The wildlings might have a hundred and twenty men, but four defenders would be enough to see them off, with a few well-placed arrows and perhaps a pail of stones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他心中仍暗暗希望斯迪的担忧是正确的。若诸神慈悲，一支正好经过的巡逻队就能制止这一切。“再坚固的墙也不能保证高枕无忧，”从前在临冬城上散步时，父亲曾教诲他，“关键取决于人。”野人也许有一百二十个，但四个卫兵就足以打发他们，若干箭失，一桶石头，这次袭击就得划上句号。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So slow," the Magnar complained loudly, as he watched them edge their way upward. "Has he forgotten the crows? He should climb faster, afore we are discovered."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太慢了，”马格拿一边看他们缓缓往上爬，一边大声抱怨，“他忘记那些乌鸦了吗？爬快点，否则我们会被发现的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon had to hold his tongue. He remembered the Skirling Pass all too well, and the moonlight climb he'd made with Stonesnake. He had swallowed his heart a half-dozen times that night, and by the end his arms and legs had been aching and his fingers were half frozen. And that was stone, not ice. Stone was solid. Ice was treacherous stuff at the best of times, and on a day like this, when the Wall was weeping, the warmth of a climber's hand might be enough to melt it. The huge blocks could be frozen rock-hard inside, but their outer surface would be slick, with runnels of water trickling down, and patches of rotten ice where the air had gotten in. Whatever else the wildlings are, they're brave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩强迫自己保持沉默。他对风声峡仍记忆忧新，月光下跟石蛇一起攀爬的经历让他至今心有余悸。那天晚上，他的心好几次提到了嗓子眼，到最后，手腿齐疼，指头几乎冻僵了。那还是石头，不是冰。石头是固体，而冰再怎么也不可信赖。今天的长城在“哭泣”，也许攀登者手上的热量就足以融化冰墙。巨大冰块内部也许冻得跟石头无异，但表面滑溜，丝丝绢流滴淌而下，寒风更吹出无数小孔。不管野人们其他方面如何，他们的确勇敢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No defenders appeared, however; not four, not even one. The sun climbed the sky and the wildlings climbed the Wall. Jarl's four remained well ahead till noon, when they hit a pitch of bad ice. Jarl had looped his rope around a wind-carved pinnace and was using it to support his weight when the whole jagged thing suddenly crumbled and came crashing down, and him with it. Chunks of ice as big as a man's head bombarded the three below, but they clung to the handholds and the stakes held, and Jarl jerked to a sudden halt at the end of the rope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但卫兵没有出现，别说四人，连一个都没有。太阳向天空爬，野人们往墙上登。到得中午，贾尔那组仍遥遥领先，但他们碰上一片很糟糕的冰。贾尔将绳子绕在风蚀而成的突起上，利用它来支撑重量，不料整个突出部分却突然崩溃，带他一起坠落。人头大的冰块向下面三个人砸来，他们死命抓牢，而那些钉子也撑住了。贾尔在半空中停顿，悬于绳子尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time his team had recovered from that mischance, Grigg the Goat had almost drawn even with them. Errok's four remained well behind. The face where they were climbing looked smooth and unpitted, covered with a sheet of icemelt that glistened wetly where the sun brushed it. Grigg's section was darker to the eye, with more obvious features; long horizontal ledges where a block had been imperfectly positioned atop the block below, cracks and crevices, even chimneys along the vertical joins, where wind and water had eaten holes large enough for a man to hide in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他们从这次灾难中恢复，山羊格里格已几乎赶上。埃洛克的四个人仍远远落在后面。他们攀爬的那部分，表面看上去平整光滑，毫无杂质，覆着一层融化的冰，阳光到处湿乎乎的闪耀光芒。格里格的那部分看起来颜色更深，有较多明显的纹理；冰与冰互相重叠时，若接合不完美，就会产生长而狭窄的平台，及各种裂纹瑕隙，甚至还有竖直的管道，经由风水侵蚀，里面的空间大得足以躲进一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the sixth hour, Jarl had moved ahead of Grigg the Goat again, and his men were widening the gap. "The Mance's pet must want a sword," the Magnar said, shading his eyes. The sun was high in the sky, and the upper third of the Wall was a crystalline blue from below, reflecting so brilliantly that it hurt the eyes to look on it. Jarl's four and Grigg's were all but lost in the glare, though Errok's team was still in shadow. Instead of moving upward they were edging their way sideways at about five hundred feet, making for a chimney. Jon was watching them inch along when he heard the sound -- a sudden crack that seemed to roll along the ice, followed by a shout of alarm. And then the air was full of shards and shrieks and falling men, as a sheet of ice a foot thick and fifty feet square broke off from the Wall and came tumbling, crumbling, rumbling, sweeping all before it. Even down at the foot of the ridge, some chunks came spinning through the trees and rolling down the slope. Jon grabbed Ygritte and pulled her down to shield her, and one of the Therms was struck in the face by a chunk that broke his nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爬到第六个钟头，贾尔又超到山羊格里格前面，他的人正将差距拉开。“曼斯的宠物迫不及待想要剑咧，”马格拿遮着眼睛说。太阳高悬在空中，从下往上观之，冰墙上部三分之一是水晶般的蓝，反光如此绚烂，刺得眼睛发疼。贾尔和格里格手下的八人都位于耀眼的光芒中，看不真切，只有埃洛克的那组仍在阴影下。他们在五百尺的高度不再往上爬，而是一点一点横移，向一根竖直管道前进。正当琼恩注视着他们缓缓挪移时，突然传来一阵响动——如天崩地裂，似乎冰墙在抖，然后一声惊呼。空中满是冰晶、尖叫和坠落的人体，一块一尺厚五十尺见方的冰从墙面上脱落，一路翻滚、碎裂、轰鸣，抹去前方的一切，直落到山脚下。冰块旋转着掠过树林，滚下山坡。琼恩忙抓住耶哥蕊特，将她拉倒，用身体掩护。一个瑟恩人脸上被一块冰砸中，断了鼻子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jarl soon had his men edging upward again. His four and Grigg's moved almost side by side, with Errok's fifty feet below. Deerhom axes chopped and hacked, sending showers of glittery shards cascading down onto the trees. Stone hammers pounded stakes deep into the ice to serve as anchors for the ropes; the iron stakes ran out before they were halfway up, and after that the climbers used horn and sharpened bone. And the men kicked, driving the spikes on their boots against the hard unyielding ice again and again and again and again to make one foothold. Their legs must be numb, Jon thought by the fourth hour. How long can they keep on with that? He watched as restless as the Magnar, listening for the distant moan of a Therm warhorn. But the horns stayed silent, and there was no sign of the Night's Watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾尔很快让他的人继续前进，他和格里格的组几乎并肩而行，埃洛克那组则落后五十尺。在鹿角斧的劈砍之下，阵阵闪烁的冰晶瀑布倾泻到下面树林里。石锤将铁钉深敲入冰里，作为绳子的支撑点，但爬了一半不到，铁钉就用完了，之后改用角钉和磨尖的骨头。人们一次一次又一次用尖刺靴去踢坚硬牢固的冰，以凿出落脚点来。到第四个钟头，琼恩估计他们的腿已经麻痹了。还能支持多久呢？他跟马格拿一样，一边不安地注视，一边焦急地聆听远处是否有瑟恩人的号角吹响。号角一直沉默，没有守夜人的踪影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And when they looked up Jarl and his team were gone. Men, ropes, stakes, all gone; nothing remained above six hundred feet. There was a wound in the Wall where the climbers had clung half a heartbeat before, the ice within as smooth and white as polished marble and shining in the sun. Far far below there was a faint red smear where someone had smashed against a frozen pinnace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他们再度抬头，贾尔那组已不见踪影。人，绳索，钉子全没了，六百尺以上一片空旷。就在攀登者们片刻之前附着的地方，墙面上有个疤痕，内层的冰平滑洁白，像抛光的大理石般在阳光下闪耀。下方很远处，有滩淡淡的红色污渍，那是被摔碎的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found Jarl in a tree, impaled upon a splintered branch and still roped to the three men who lay broken beneath him. One was still alive, but his legs and spine were shattered, and most of his ribs as well. "Mercy," he said when they came upon him. One of the Therms smashed his head in with a big stone mace. The Magnar gave orders, and his men began to gather fuel for a pyre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在一棵树上发现了贾尔，他被断裂的树枝刺穿，身上的绳索仍连着其他三人——皆浑身骨头碎裂，躺在他下方。其中一个仍活着，但腿、脊椎和大部分肋骨都不能用了。“慈悲，”看见他们，他说。一个瑟恩人用大石锤砸扁了他的脑袋。马格拿发号施令，他的人开始搭建柴堆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun had begun to sink by then, so the climbers wasted little time. They unwound the long coils of hemp they'd had looped around their chests, tied them all together, and tossed down one end. The thought of trying to climb five hundred feet up that rope filled Jon with dread, but Mance had planned better than that. The raiders Jarl had left below uncasked a huge ladder, with rungs of woven hemp as thick as a man's arm, and tied it to the climbers' rope. Errok and Grigg and their men grunted and heaved, pulled it up, staked it to the top, then lowered the rope again to haul up a second ladder. There were five altogether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时太阳已开始下降，攀登者们没有浪费时间。他们解开缠绕在胸前的长麻绳，将其系到一起，把末端扔下。想到要沿绳子爬上五百尺，琼恩满心恐惧，好在曼斯计划周全。贾尔留下的掠袭者们取出一个巨型梯子，作横挡的麻绳有人胳膊那么粗，他们把梯子系在攀登者扔下的绳子上，埃洛克、格里格和他们的部下闷哼着使劲将它拉上去，固定在墙顶，然后再次放下绳索，拉起第二个梯子。一共有五个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When all of them were in place, the Magnar shouted a brusque command in the Old Tongue, and five of his Therms started up together. Even with the ladders, it was no easy climb. Ygritte watched them struggle for a while. "I hate this Wall," she said in a low angry voice. "Can you feel how cold it is?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等梯子全部就位，马格拿操起古语粗暴地一声喝令，五个瑟恩人便同时出发。即使有梯子，攀爬也不容易。耶哥蕊特看他们挣扎了好长一阵。“我恨长城，”她用生气的语调轻声说，“你能感觉到它有多冷吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nor had it drunk its fill. By sunset, two of the Therms had fallen from the ladder to their deaths, but they were the last. It was near midnight before Jon reached the top. The stars were out again, and Ygritte was trembling from the climb. "I almost fell," she said, with tears in her eyes. "Twice. Thrice. The Wall was trying t' shake me off, I could feel it." one of the tears broke free and trickled slowly down her cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它没有喝够。日落时分，两个瑟恩人从梯子上摔下去死了，这是今天最后一批牺牲品。琼恩到达墙顶时，已近午夜，群星又出来了，耶哥蕊特浑身颤抖。“我差点掉下去，”她眼含泪水，“两三次…冰墙想把我甩下去，我感觉得到。”一颗泪滴涌出来，顺着她的脸颊缓缓流淌。">查看中文翻译</div>
