<div class="line_en">So much depends then, thought Lily Briscoe, looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it, which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she thought, upon distance: whether people are near us or far from us; for her feeling for Mr Ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay. It seemed to be elongated, stretched out; he seemed to become more and more remote. He and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue, that distance; but here, on the lawn, close at hand, Mr Carmichael suddenly grunted. She laughed. He clawed his book up from the grass. He settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster. That was different altogether, because he was so near. And now again all was quiet. They must be out of bed by this time, she supposed, looking at the house, but nothing appeared there. But then, she remembered, they had always made off directly a meal was over, on business of their own. It was all in keeping with this silence, this emptiness, and the unreality of the early morning hour. It was a way things had sometimes, she thought, lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke: they became illness, before habits had spun themselves across the surface, one felt that same unreality, which was so startling; felt something emerge. Life was most vivid then. One could be at one's ease. Mercifully one need not say, very briskly, crossing the lawn to greet old Mrs Beckwith, who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in, "Oh, good-morning, Mrs Beckwith! What a lovely day! Are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun? Jasper's hidden the chairs. Do let me find you one!" and all the rest of the usual chatter. One need not speak at all. One glided, one shook one's sails (there was a good deal of movement in the bay, boats were starting off) between things, beyond things. Empty it was not, but full to the brim. She seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance, to move and float and sink in it, yes, for these waters were unfathomably deep. Into them had spilled so many lives. The Ramsays'; the children's; and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides. A washer-woman with her basket; a rook, a red-hot poker; the purples and grey-greens of flowers: some common feeling which held the whole together.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her eyes rested on the brown speck of Mr Ramsay's sailing boat. They would be at the Lighthouse by lunch time she supposed. But the wind had freshened, and, as the sky changed slightly and the sea changed slightly and the boards altered their positions, the view, which a moment before had seemed miraculously fixed, was now unsatisfactory. The wind had blown the trail of smoke about; there was something displeasing about the placing of the ships.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的目光停留在了拉拇齐先生的帆船所形成的棕色小点上。她猜想午饭时分他们可以到达灯塔了。但风大了，天空起了些许变化，大海起了些许变化，船全都改变了位置，片刻以前还似乎令人不可思议地固定着的景色现在不能让人感到满意了。风把烟迹吹散了；船只的位置也有让人看了不愉快之处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The disproportion there seemed to upset some harmony in her own mind. She felt an obscure distress. It was confirmed when she turned to her picture. She had been wasting her morning. For whatever reason she could not achieve that razor edge of balance between two opposite forces; Mr Ramsay and the picture; which was necessary. There was something perhaps wrong with the design? Was it, she wondered, that the line of the wall wanted breaking, was it that the mass of the trees was too heavy? She smiled ironically; for had she not thought, when she began, that she had solved her problem?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海上出现的缺少平衡的景象似乎破坏了她自己心中的某种和谐。她感到一种无可名状的苦恼。当她转向她的画时，这感觉更加强了。她把早晨的时间给浪费了。不知为什么，她无法在两个相对的力量——拉姆齐先生和她的画——之间找到关键的平衡，而这是必需具有的。也许是构思上有什么毛病？她在想，会不会是墙的那道线需要断开，会不会是那一片树林的颜色太浓重了？她嘲笑着自己；她不是在开始时就觉得她已经把问题给解决了吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was some such feeling of completeness perhaps which, ten years ago, standing almost where she stood now, had made her say that she must be in love with the place. Love had a thousand shapes. There might be lovers whose gift it was to choose out the elements of things and place them together and so, giving them a wholeness not theirs in life, make of some scene, or meeting of people (all now gone and separate), one of those globed compacted things over which thought lingers, and love plays.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许正是这种完满的感觉，使得她在十年前站在几乎就是现在她站的这个位置上，说出了：她想必是爱上了这个地方。爱有一千种形态。很可能有这样的恋人，他们的才能在于挑选出事物的要素，将它们置于一处，从而赋与它们一种它们本身的生活中并不具有的完整性，使某些场景和人们的相聚（现在已全部离开、分散）结合成一种紧密的球体，思绪可以长久徘徊其上，爱可以在上面嬉戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What was the problem then? She must try to get hold of something tht evaded her. It evaded her when she thought of Mrs Ramsay; it evaded her now when she thought of her picture. Phrases came. Visions came. Beautiful pictures. Beautiful phrases. But what she wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before it has been made anything. Get that and start afresh; get that and start afresh; she said desperately, pitching herself firmly again before her easel. It was a miserable machine, an inefficient machine, she thought, the human apparatus for painting or for feeling; it always broke down at the critical moment; heroically, one must force it on. She stared, frowning. There was the hedge, sure enough. But one got nothing by soliciting urgently. One got only a glare in the eye from looking at the line of the wall, or from thinking -- she wore a grey hat. She was astonishingly beautiful. Let it come, she thought, if it will come. For there are moments when one can neither think nor feel, she thought, where is one?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么问题究竟是什么？她必须抓住那个躲闪着使她难以捕捉的东西。当她想到拉姆齐夫人的时候它躲闪开了；现在当她想到她的画时它躲闪开了。词句出现了。幻想出现了。美丽的词句。但是她想要捕捉的正是那刺激神经的东西，是末被加工成任何东西之前的事物的本身。抓住它然后再从头开始；抓住它然后再从头开始；她不顾一切地说，同时坚定地再一次把自己摆在了画架前。人类用来绘画或感觉的设备是一台可怜的机器，一台效率极低的机器，她心想：总是在关键的时刻出毛病；你必需英勇地迫使它继续运转下去。她凝视着，皱起了眉头。没错，树篱在那里。但是通过迫切的恳求是什么也得不到的。你盯着那道墙线，或者想像拉姆齐夫人戴着一顶灰帽子，结果得到的只是眼睛被晃得什么也看不见。她美得惊人。她想，如果会来，就让它自动来吧。因为有的时候你既无法思考也无法感觉。而如果你既无法思考也无法感觉，她想，那么你身在何处呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here on the grass, on the ground, she thought, sitting down, and examining with her brush a little colony of plantains. For the lawn was very rough. Here sitting on the world, she thought, for she could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was happening for the first time, perhaps for the last time, as a traveller, even though he is half asleep, knows, looking out of the train window, that he must look now, for he will never see that town, or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the fields, again. The lawn was the world; they were up here together, on this exalted station, she thought, looking at old Mr Carmichael, who seemed (though they had not said a word all this time) to share her thoughts. And she would never see him again perhaps. He was growing old. Also, she remembered, smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot, he was growing famous. People said that his poetry was "so beautiful." They went and published things he had written forty years ago. There was a famous man now called Carmichael, she smiled, thinking how many shapes one person might wear, how he was that in the newspapers, but here the same as he had always been. He looked the same -- greyer, rather. Yes, he looked the same, but somebody had said, she recalled, that when he had heard of Andrew Ramsay's death (he was killed in a second by a shell; he should have been a great mathematician) Mr Carmichael had "lost all interest in life." What did it mean -- that? she wondered. Had he marched through Trafalgar Square grasping a big stick? Had he turned pages over and over, without reading them, sitting in his room in St. John's Wood alone? She did not know what he had done, when he heard that Andrew was killed, but she felt it in him all the same. They only mumbled at each other on staircases; they looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it won't be fine. But this was one way of knowing people, she thought: to know the outline, not the detail, to sit in one's garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather. She knew him in that way. She knew that he had changed somehow. She had never read a line of his poetry. She thought that she knew how it went though, slowly and sonorously. It was seasoned and mellow. It was about the desert and the camel. It was about the palm tree and the sunset. It was extremely impersonal; it said something about death; it said very little about love. There was an impersonality about him. He wanted very little of other people. Had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing-room window with some newspaper under his arm, trying to avoid Mrs Ramsay whom for some reason he did not much like? On that account, of course, she would always try to make him stop. He would bow to her. He would halt unwillingly and bow profoundly. Annoyed that he did not want anything of her, Mrs Ramsay would ask him (Lily could hear her) wouldn't he like a coat, a rug, a newspaper? No, he wanted nothing. (Here he bowed.) There was some quality in her which he did not much like. It was perhaps her masterfulness, her positiveness, something matter-of-fact in her. She was so direct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这儿草坪上，在地上，她想道，一面坐下来，用画笔扒拉着一片车前草，察看着。草坪上杂草丛生。她在这儿，坐在这个世界上，她想，因为她无法摆脱这种感觉，今天早上发生的一切都是第一次，也许也是最后一次，如同一个在旅途上的人，即便他处于昏昏欲睡的状态，在向火车窗外看去时，也知道他现在必须去看，因为他再也不会看见那个城镇，或那辆骡车，或在田里干活的那个女人了。这片草坪就是世界；他们一起住这里，在这个高出来的车站上，她想，一面看着老卡迈克尔先生，他似乎和她有同感（虽然他们始终一句话也没有淡过）。也许她以后再也不会看到他了。他越来越老了。而且，她记得、看着那只摇摇晃晃地吊在他脚上的拖鞋，她不禁笑了起来，他也越来越出名了。人们说他的诗是“如此之美”。他们甚至把他四十年前写的东西也拿去出版了。现在有一个叫卡迈克尔的名人了，她笑着想到一个人可以有多少种形态，在报纸上是那样，但在这儿却和从前完全一样。他看上去还是那个样子——只是头发白多了。是的，他看上去还是那个样子，但是她回想起，有人说过，当卡迈克尔先生听到安德鲁·拉姆齐的死讯时（他是被炮弹击中后立即死去的；他本应成为一个伟大的数学家的），他“失去了对生活的一切兴趣”。这意味着什么——这样一句话？她琢磨着。他有没有抓着根大手杖行进在特拉法尔加广场上？他有没有独自坐在圣约翰树林自己的房间里，一再翻动书页却一个字也看不进去？她不知道当他听到安德鲁牺牲的消息时都做了些什么，但她仍能感到这件事对他的打击。他们仅仅在楼梯上碰见时含含糊糊地打个招呼；抬头看看天，说天气是好还是不好。但她认为这也是了解人的一种方式：了解轮廓而不是细节，如同坐在自己的花园里看山坡泛着青紫色伸向远方长满石南的草原。她对他的了解就是这样的。她知道他由于某种原因产生了变化。她从未读过一行他的诗。但她认为自己知道他的诗是怎么回事，节奏缓慢、音调铿销锵。醇厚丰美。诗中写的是沙漠和骆驼。是棕榈树和落日。不带任何个人情感；它讲到死亡；很少讲到爱情。他身上有一种超然的气质。他很少对别人有什么需求。他不就曾经胳膊下面夹着报纸，带着几分尴尬蹒跚着走过客厅的窗口，尽力想避开他不知为何不怎么喜欢的拉姆齐夫人的吗？当然也正是因为这个原因，她总要让他停下来。他会对她鞠个躬。他会极不情愿地停下来，深深地一鞠躬。拉姆齐夫人很不高兴他无求于她，会问他（莉莉仍能听见她的声音）他要件外衣、一条小毯子、或者报纸吗？不，他什么也不需要。（此时他鞠了个躬。）她身上有某些品质他不怎么喜欢。也许是她的好支配人，她的过分自信，还有她的讲求实际。他总是那么直率。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There must have been people who disliked her very much, Lily thought (Yes; she realised that the drawing-room step was empty, but it had no effect on her whatever. She did not want Mrs Ramsay now.)-- People who thought her too sure, too drastic. Also, her beauty offended people probably. How monotonous, they would say, and the same always! They preferred another type -- the dark, the vivacious. Then she was weak with her husband. She let him make those scenes. Then she was reserved. Nobody knew exactly what had happened to her. And (to go back to Mr Carmichael and his dislike) one could not imagine Mrs Ramsay standing painting, lying reading, a whole morning on the lawn. It was unthinkable. Without saying a word, the only token of her errand a basket on her arm, she went off to the town, to the poor, to sit in some stuffy little bedroom. Often and often Lily had seen her go silently in the midst of some game, some discussion, with her basket on her arm, very upright. She had noted her return. She had thought, half laughing (she was so methodical with the tea cups), half moved (her beauty took one's breath away), eyes that are closing in pain have looked on you. You have been with them there.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Mrs Ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late, or the butter not fresh, or the teapot chipped. And all the time she was saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of Greek temples, and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little room. She never talked of it -- she went, punctually, directly. It was her instinct to go, an instinct like the swallows for the south, the artichokes for the sun, turning her infallibly to the human race, making her nest in its heart. And this, like all instincts, was a little distressing to people who did not share it; to Mr Carmichael perhaps, to herself certainly. Some notion was in both of them about the ineffectiveness of action, the supremacy of thought. Her going was a reproach to them, gave a different twist to the world, so that they were led to protest, seeing their own prepossessions disappear, and clutch at them vanishing. Charles Tansley did that too: it was part of the reason why one disliked him. He upset the proportions of one's world. And what had happened to him, she wondered, idly stirring the platains with her brush. He had got his fellowship. He had married; he lived at Golder's Green.</div>
