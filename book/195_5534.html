<div class="line_en">Hayward, whom Philip had not seen since he left Heidelberg, arrived in Paris to spend a few days in time to come to the party which Lawson and Philip were giving in their studio to celebrate the hanging of Lawson's pictures. Philip had been eager to see Hayward again, but when at last they met, he experienced some disappointment. Hayward had altered a little in appearance: his fine hair was thinner, and with the rapid wilting of the very fair, he was becoming wizened and colourless; his blue eyes were paler than they had been, and there was a muzziness about his features. On the other hand, in mind he did not seem to have changed at all, and the culture which had impressed Philip at eighteen aroused somewhat the contempt of Philip at twenty-one. He had altered a good deal himself, and regarding with scorn all his old opinions of art, life, and letters, had no patience with anyone who still held them. He was scarcely conscious of the fact that he wanted to show off before Hayward, but when he took him round the galleries he poured out to him all the revolutionary opinions which himself had so recently adopted. He took him to Manet's Olympia and said dramatically:</div>

<div class="line_en">In March there was all the excitement of sending in to the Salon. Clutton, characteristically, had nothing ready, and he was very scornful of the two heads that Lawson sent; they were obviously the work of a student, straight-forward portraits of models, but they had a certain force; Clutton, aiming at perfection, had no patience with efforts which betrayed hesitancy, and with a shrug of the shoulders told Lawson it was an impertinence to exhibit stuff which should never have been allowed out of his studio; he was not less contemptuous when the two heads were accepted. Flanagan tried his luck too, but his picture was refused. Mrs. Otter sent a blameless Portrait de ma Mere, accomplished and second-rate; and was hung in a very good place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三月的画室特别热闹，学生们都忙着给展览会投送画稿。一贯特立独行的克拉顿没有什么作品能投，他对劳森为参展准备的两幅人头素描很是不屑。这两幅画一看就是学生水平，完全是照着模特来画的，但线条还算有点力度，画风也挺有气魄。克拉顿事事力求完美，最看不惯有人拿着火候未到、不成熟的画作出来丢人现眼。他耸了耸肩膀跟劳森说把一些连画室大门都拿不出去的作品送去参展，真是不知道被什么冲昏了头。等知道劳森的两幅作品都被选上了以后，他这股轻蔑的劲儿也丝毫没有减弱。弗拉纳根也想试试运气，但是他的画没有入选。奥特夫人寄去了一张肖像画《母亲》。谁也说不出这画有哪里不好，事实上，它确实画得不错，但只能算是二流作品。这幅画被挂在了一个非常显眼的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was dogmatic with those who did not venture to assert themselves, but with the self-assertive he was very modest. He was impressed by Philip's assurance, and accepted meekly Philip's implied suggestion that the painter's arrogant claim to be the sole possible judge of painting has anything but its impertinence to recommend it.</div>

<div class="line_en">A day or two later Philip and Lawson gave their party. Cronshaw, making an exception in their favour, agreed to eat their food; and Miss Chalice offered to come and cook for them. She took no interest in her own sex and declined the suggestion that other girls should be asked for her sake. Clutton, Flanagan, Potter, and two others made up the party. Furniture was scarce, so the model stand was used as a table, and the guests were to sit on portmanteaux if they liked, and if they didn't on the floor. The feast consisted of a pot-au-feu, which Miss Chalice had made, of a leg of mutton roasted round the corner and brought round hot and savoury (Miss Chalice had cooked the potatoes, and the studio was redolent of the carrots she had fried; fried carrots were her specialty); and this was to be followed by poires flambees, pears with burning brandy, which Cronshaw had volunteered to make. The meal was to finish with an enormous fromage de Brie, which stood near the window and added fragrant odours to all the others which filled the studio. Cronshaw sat in the place of honour on a Gladstone bag, with his legs curled under him like a Turkish bashaw, beaming good-naturedly on the young people who surrounded him. From force of habit, though the small studio with the stove lit was very hot, he kept on his great-coat, with the collar turned up, and his bowler hat: he looked with satisfaction on the four large fiaschi of Chianti which stood in front of him in a row, two on each side of a bottle of whiskey; he said it reminded him of a slim fair Circassian guarded by four corpulent eunuchs. Hayward in order to put the rest of them at their ease had clothed himself in a tweed suit and a Trinity Hall tie. He looked grotesquely British. The others were elaborately polite to him, and during the soup they talked of the weather and the political situation. There was a pause while they waited for the leg of mutton, and Miss Chalice lit a cigarette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了两三天，庆功宴开始了。克朗肖也破格接受邀请，答应来尝尝他们的手艺；查理斯小姐主动提议要来帮着做菜。她不喜欢和同性相处，虽然男士们提议要再找几位女士给她作伴，却被她一口回绝了。参加宴会的人里还有克拉顿、弗拉纳根、波特和另外两个朋友。屋里家具寥寥，模特的站台被用来当桌子使，宾客们要是愿意的话可以坐在皮箱上，要是不愿意的话就干脆席地而坐。当天的菜色包括查理斯小姐做的法式砂锅炖菜，从附近餐馆买来的热气腾腾、香气扑鼻的烤羊腿（配餐的土豆也是查理斯小姐做的，整个画室里都飘散着她煎的胡萝卜的香味儿；煎胡萝卜是查理斯小姐的拿手菜）；烤羊腿后配的甜点是用白兰地烧制的酒烹梨子，这道菜是克朗肖主动要求做的。结束整顿饭之前，他们还要分享一块巨大的布里干酪。此时这块干酪正放在窗边，散发出的悠悠浓香混合着各种饭菜的香气让人馋涎欲滴。克朗肖坐在上座位置的一个轻便旅行箱上，腿盘在身下，看上去像个土耳其帕夏。他笑眯眯地一脸慈祥地看着围坐在身边的年轻人。尽管这间生着炉子的小画室暖烘烘的，可他还是习惯性地穿着外套，竖起领子，戴着圆顶礼帽。他看着面前排成一行的意大利基安蒂葡萄酒露出心满意足的表情，这四瓶葡萄酒中间还摆了瓶威士忌。他说这让他想到了一位身材窈窕的切尔克斯女郎和四个伺候着她的胖阉奴。为了不让在座其他英国人感到不自在，他当天特地穿了一套花呢西服，打了一条剑桥大学三一学院的领带。这身英式打扮让他看起来不伦不类。座上其他人都对他毕恭毕敬，喝汤的时候还和他讨论了一下天气和最近的政治局势。等羊腿上桌的空当里，查理斯小姐点燃了一根香烟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With her large brown eyes, thin, ascetic face, her pale skin, and broad forehead, she might have stepped out of a picture by Burne-Jones. She had long, beautiful hands, with fingers deeply stained by nicotine. She wore sweeping draperies, mauve and green. There was about her the romantic air of High Street, Kensington. She was wantonly aesthetic; but she was an excellent creature, kind and good natured; and her affectations were but skin-deep. There was a knock at the door, and they all gave a shout of exultation. Miss Chalice rose and opened. She took the leg of mutton and held it high above her, as though it were the head of John the Baptist on a platter; and, the cigarette still in her mouth, advanced with solemn, hieratic steps.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mutton was eaten with gusto, and it did one good to see what a hearty appetite the pale-faced lady had. Clutton and Potter sat on each side of her, and everyone knew that neither had found her unduly coy. She grew tired of most people in six weeks, but she knew exactly how to treat afterwards the gentlemen who had laid their young hearts at her feet. She bore them no ill-will, though having loved them she had ceased to do so, and treated them with friendliness but without familiarity. Now and then she looked at Lawson with melancholy eyes. The poires flambees were a great success, partly because of the brandy, and partly because Miss Chalice insisted that they should be eaten with the cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家津津有味地吃起羊腿来，尤其是看到一个面色苍白的女孩胃口能这么好，心里更觉得痛快。克拉顿和波特坐在查理斯小姐两侧，大家都看得出来这两个傻小子谁都没发现夹在中间的女孩很不自在。她来到画室已经六个礼拜多了，大部分人她都看不上眼，却知道应该怎么对付那些拜倒在她裙下的小伙儿。她对他们从来都没有恶意，就算是和一些爱过的旧情人，都保持着有一定距离的友谊。她不时朝劳森望一眼，眼波里尽是忧伤。当天的酒烹梨子大受欢迎，也许是里面加入的白兰地酒醇香可口，也许是因为查理斯小姐坚持让大家搭配干酪一起吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Coffee and cognac followed with sufficient speed to prevent any untoward consequence, and they settled down to smoke in comfort. Ruth Chalice, who could do nothing that was not deliberately artistic, arranged herself in a graceful attitude by Cronshaw and just rested her exquisite head on his shoulder. She looked into the dark abyss of time with brooding eyes, and now and then with a long meditative glance at Lawson she sighed deeply.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then came the summer, and restlessness seized these young people. The blue skies lured them to the sea, and the pleasant breeze sighing through the leaves of the plane-trees on the boulevard drew them towards the country. Everyone made plans for leaving Paris; they discussed what was the most suitable size for the canvases they meant to take; they laid in stores of panels for sketching; they argued about the merits of various places in Brittany. Flanagan and Potter went to Concarneau; Mrs. Otter and her mother, with a natural instinct for the obvious, went to Pont-Aven; Philip and Lawson made up their minds to go to the forest of Fontainebleau, and Miss Chalice knew of a very good hotel at Moret where there was lots of stuff to paint; it was near Paris, and neither Philip nor Lawson was indifferent to the railway fare. Ruth Chalice would be there, and Lawson had an idea for a portrait of her in the open air. Just then the Salon was full of portraits of people in gardens, in sunlight, with blinking eyes and green reflections of sunlit leaves on their faces. They asked Clutton to go with them, but he preferred spending the summer by himself. He had just discovered Cezanne, and was uger to go to Provence; he wanted heavy skies from which the hot blue seemed to drip like beads of sweat, and broad white dusty roads, and pale roofs out of which the sun had burnt the colour, and olive trees gray with heat.</div>

He was not a man to think girls were in love with him; he was too conscious of his deformity, and he felt awkward and clumsy with women; but he did not know what else this outburst could mean. Fanny Price, in the dirty brown dress, with her hair falling over her face, sloppy, untidy, stood before him; and tears of anger rolled down her cheeks. She was repellent. Philip glanced at the door, instinctively hoping that someone would come in and put an end to the scene.</div>

<div class="line_en">Moret was in those days an old-fashioned town of one street at the edge of the forest of Fontainebleau, and the Ecu d'Or was a hotel which still had about it the decrepit air of the Ancien Regime. It faced the winding river, the Loing; and Miss Chalice had a room with a little terrace overlooking it, with a charming view of the old bridge and its fortified gateway. They sat here in the evenings after dinner, drinking coffee, smoking, and discussing art. There ran into the river, a little way off, a narrow canal bordered by poplars, and along the banks of this after their day's work they often wandered. They spent all day painting. Like most of their generation they were obsessed by the fear of the picturesque, and they turned their backs on the obvious beauty of the town to seek subjects which were devoid of a prettiness they despised. Sisley and Monet had painted the canal with its poplars, and they felt a desire to try their hands at what was so typical of France; but they were frightened of its formal beauty, and set themselves deliberately to avoid it. Miss Chalice, who had a clever dexterity which impressed Lawson notwithstanding his contempt for feminine art, started a picture in which she tried to circumvent the commonplace by leaving out the tops of the trees; and Lawson had the brilliant idea of putting in his foreground a large blue advertisement of chocolat Menier in order to emphasise his abhorrence of the chocolate box.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip began now to paint in oils. He experienced a thrill of delight when first he used that grateful medium. He went out with Lawson in the morning with his little box and sat by him painting a panel; it gave him so much satisfaction that he did not realise he was doing no more than copy; he was so much under his friend's influence that he saw only with his eyes. Lawson painted very low in tone, and they both saw the emerald of the grass like dark velvet, while the brilliance of the sky turned in their hands to a brooding ultramarine. Through July they had one fine day after another; it was very hot; and the heat, searing Philip's heart, filled him with languor; he could not work; his mind was eager with a thousand thoughts. Often he spent the mornings by the side of the canal in the shade of the poplars, reading a few lines and then dreaming for half an hour. Sometimes he hired a rickety bicycle and rode along the dusty road that led to the forest, and then lay down in a clearing. His head was full of romantic fancies. The ladies of Watteau, gay and insouciant, seemed to wander with their cavaliers among the great trees, whispering to one another careless, charming things, and yet somehow oppressed by a nameless fear.</div>

<div class="line_en">It grew so hot that it was almost impossible to sleep at night. The heat seemed to linger under the trees as though it were a material thing. They did not wish to leave the starlit night, and the three of them would sit on the terrace of Ruth Chalice's room, silent, hour after hour, too tired to talk any more, but in voluptuous enjoyment of the stillness. They listened to the murmur of the river. The church clock struck one and two and sometimes three before they could drag themselves to bed. Suddenly Philip became aware that Ruth Chalice and Lawson were lovers. He divined it in the way the girl looked at the young painter, and in his air of possession; and as Philip sat with them he felt a kind of effluence surrounding them, as though the air were heavy with something strange. The revelation was a shock. He had looked upon Miss Chalice as a very good fellow and he liked to talk to her, but it had never seemed to him possible to enter into a closer relationship. One Sunday they had all gone with a tea-basket into the forest, and when they came to a glade which was suitably sylvan, Miss Chalice, because it was idyllic, insisted on taking off her shoes and stockings. It would have been very charming only her feet were rather large and she had on both a large corn on the third toe. Philip felt it made her proceeding a little ridiculous. But now he looked upon her quite differently; there was something softly feminine in her large eyes and her olive skin; he felt himself a fool not to have seen that she was attractive. He thought he detected in her a touch of contempt for him, because he had not had the sense to see that she was there, in his way, and in Lawson a suspicion of superiority. He was envious of Lawson, and he was jealous, not of the individual concerned, but of his love. He wished that he was standing in his shoes and feeling with his heart. He was troubled, and the fear seized him that love would pass him by. He wanted a passion to seize him, he wanted to be swept off his feet and borne powerless in a mighty rush he cared not whither. Miss Chalice and Lawson seemed to him now somehow different, and the constant companionship with them made him restless. He was dissatisfied with himself. Life was not giving him what he wanted, and he had an uneasy feeling that he was losing his time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气越来越热，晚上几乎难以入眠。树下蒸腾的热气迟迟散不去，像有形的物质一样赖在这里不肯走。他们不愿辜负这星光灿烂的夏夜，于是在露丝·查理斯房间的阳台上一坐就是几个钟头。大家都太疲乏，无人有心交谈，只是安静地坐在那里享受着无言静默的撩人欢喜。窗下河流潺潺而过，直到钟声敲响了一下、两下，甚至有时候敲了三下他们才会拖着脚步恋恋不舍地回房休息。菲利普忽然发现了查理斯和劳森是对恋人。女孩向年轻画家投去的目光写满万千情愫，画家对女孩也似是有种合情合理的占有感，这些都让菲利普对自己的发现坚信不疑。他坐在两人身边，感到有种压抑的激情暗暗萌生，空气变得非常凝重，夹杂着某种让人看不透彻的东西。这个发现让菲利普大惊失色。他一直觉得查理斯小姐是位教养良好的女士，他很喜欢和她说话，但却从没想过要同她更进一步。礼拜天他们带着茶点篮子去森林喝茶。来到一片林中空地，查理斯小姐被如诗如画的田园景色吸引了，执意要脱掉鞋袜好好享受。本来这幅画面该是非常具有挑逗意味的，只可惜她长着一双大脚，而且两脚的第三个脚趾上各生了个大鸡眼。怪不得她走起路来样子有点儿滑稽呢，菲利普心想。他现在看她的眼光和之前不大一样了。他觉得她的大眼睛和橄榄色的皮肤女人味十足。他恨自己太不开窍，竟没有早点发现她竟是这样一位可人儿。她似乎有点看不起自己，像是在鄙视自己的迟钝，这么久了都没发觉她的存在。劳森的尾巴也要翘上天了，好像有多么了不起一样。他嫉妒劳森，嫉妒到眼红。倒不是他这个人有多么值得羡慕，是他所拥有的爱情惹得别人心痒难耐。菲利普想变成劳森，想和他一样享受爱情的甜蜜滋味。他忧心忡忡，生怕一不留神爱情就从自己身边偷偷溜走。他渴望一阵激情袭来将自己卷起，不管随着漂泊到何处都不在意。对他来说，查理斯和劳森现在已经和过去不一样了，他不愿再继续插足两人之间。他埋怨自己不争气，也埋怨自己总是得不到生活的赐予，好像自己的大好年华就这么白白过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were alone in the hotel but for a fat Frenchwoman of middle age, a Rabelaisian figure with a broad, obscene laugh. She spent the day by the river patiently fishing for fish she never caught, and Philip sometimes went down and talked to her.

<div class="line_en">He shrugged his shoulders. He had a volume of Verlaine in his hands, and he wandered off. He tried to read, but his passion was too strong. He thought of the stray amours to which he had been introduced by Flanagan, the sly visits to houses in a cul-de-sac, with the drawing-room in Utrecht velvet, and the mercenary graces of painted women. He shuddered. He threw himself on the grass, stretching his limbs like a young animal freshly awaked from sleep; and the rippling water, the poplars gently tremulous in the faint breeze, the blue sky, were almost more than he could bear. He was in love with love. In his fancy he felt the kiss of warm lips on his, and around his neck the touch of soft hands. He imagined himself in the arms of Ruth Chalice, he thought of her dark eyes and the wonderful texture of her skin; he was mad to have let such a wonderful adventure slip through his fingers. And if Lawson had done it why should not he? But this was only when he did not see her, when he lay awake at night or dreamed idly by the side of the canal; when he saw her he felt suddenly quite different; he had no desire to take her in his arms, and he could not imagine himself kissing her. It was very curious. Away from her he thought her beautiful, remembering only her magnificent eyes and the creamy pallor of her face; but when he was with her he saw only that she was flat-chested and that her teeth were slightly decayed; he could not forget the corns on her toes. He could not understand himself. Would he always love only in absence and be prevented from enjoying anything when he had the chance by that deformity of vision which seemed to exaggerate the revolting?</div>
