<div class="line_en">Finally, on the fourth of November, when those he loved had left the room just for a moment -- to grab coffee in the kitchen, the first time none of them were with him since the coma began -- Morrie stopped breathing.</div>

<div class="line_en">I believe he died this way on purpose. I believe he wanted no chilling moments, no one to witness his last breath and be haunted by it, the way he had been haunted by his mother's death -- notice telegram or by his father's corpse in the city morgue.</div>

<div class="line_en">His immediate family was with him in the house. Rob made it in from Tokyo -- he got to kiss his father good-bye -- and Jon was there, and of course Charlotte was there and Charlotte's cousin Marsha, who had written the poem that so moved Morrie at his "unofficial" memorial service, the poem that likened him to a "tender sequoia." They slept in shifts around his bed. Morrie had fallen into a coma two days after our final visit, and the doctor said he could go at any moment. Instead, he hung on, through a tough afternoon, through a dark night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='他的家人都在他的身边。罗布从东京赶了回来——他要和父亲吻别——乔恩也在那儿，当然还有夏洛特以及她的表妹马莎，她在那次非正式的葬礼上写的那首诗曾深深地感动了莫里， 那首诗把莫里比作一棵"温柔的红杉"。他们轮流睡在他的床边。我最后一次见到他以后，莫里昏迷了两天，医生说他随时都会走的。但他仍拖了一个难捱的下午和一个黑暗的夜晚。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At one point, when Morrie's ashes were placed into the ground, I glanced around the cemetery. Morrie was right. It was indeed a lovely spot, trees and grass and a sloping hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当莫里的骨灰下葬时，我抬头环视了一下墓地。莫里说得对。那儿确实是个好地方，树木，青草，斜坡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rabbi Axelrod read a few poems. Morrie's brother, David -- who still walked with a limp from his childhood polio lifted the shovel and tossed dirt in the grave, as per tradition.</div>

<div class="line_en">I believe he knew that he was in his own bed, that his books and his notes and his small hibiscus plant were nearby. He wanted to go serenely, and that is how he went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我相信他知道他是在自己的床上；他的书，他的笔记，他的小木槿都在他的身边，他想安宁地离去，他确实走得很安宁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The funeral was held on a damp, windy morning. The grass was wet and the sky was the color of milk. We stood by the hole in the earth, close enough to hear the pond water lapping against the edge and to see ducks shaking off their feathers.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My father moved through theys of we, singing each new leaf out of each tree (and every child was sure that spring danced when she heard my father sing) …" -- Poem by E. E. Cummings, read by Morrie's son, Rob, at the Memorial service.</div>
