<div class="line_en">We have a large railway station, a small post office, and two rival "General Stores." Able-bodied men are apt to leave the place early in life, but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired military officers. Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the one word, "gossip."</div>

<div class="line_en">Our village. King's Abbot, is, I imagine, very much like any other village. Our big town is Cranchester, nine miles away.</div>

<div class="line_en">There are only two houses of any importance in King's Abbot. One is King's Paddock, left to Mrs Ferrars by her late husband. The other, Fernly Park, is owned by Roger Ackroyd. Ackroyd has always interested me by being a man more impossibly like a country squire than any country squire could really be. He reminds one of the red-faced sportsmen who always appeared early in the first act of an old-fashioned musical comedy, the setting being the village green. They usually sang a song about going up to London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金斯艾伯特村只有两座像样的大宅子，一座叫皇家围场，是弗拉尔斯太太从她死去的丈夫那儿继承来的；另一座叫芬利庄园，主人是罗杰·艾克罗伊德。我对艾克罗伊德一直充满好奇，因为他比其他任何一位乡绅都更有乡绅的做派，总让我想起老式音乐喜剧中那种常在第一幕早早登场、满面红光且热衷运动的家伙，在绿意盎然的乡野间，哼着“上伦敦去”的小调。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, Ackroyd is not really a country squire. He is an immensely successful manufacturer of (I think) wagon wheels. He is a man of nearly fifty years of age, rubicund of face and genial of manner. He is hand and glove with the vicar, subscribes liberally to parish funds (though rumour has it that he is extremely mean in personal expenditure), encourages cricket matches. Lads' Clubs, and Disabled Soldiers' Institutes. He is, in fact, the life and soul of our peaceful village of King's Abbot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，艾克罗伊德其实并不是乡绅，而是一位卡车轮胎（我猜的）制造商，生意做得很大。他年约半百，面色红润，待人和善，与教区牧师关系很好，经常为教会的活动慷慨解囊（但据说他在个人开销方面却异常俭省），还屡屡资助板球比赛、青年俱乐部、伤残军人协会什么的。事实上，他堪称金斯艾伯特这个宁静村庄的灵魂人物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now when Roger Ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one, he fell in love with, and married, a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior. Her name was Paton, and she was a widow with one child. The history of the marriage was short and painful. To put it bluntly, Mrs Ackroyd was a dipsomaniac. She succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four years after her marriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗杰·艾克罗伊德年仅二十一岁时，就与一名比他年长五六岁的美貌少妇坠入爱河，共结连理。她姓佩顿，是位寡妇，带了个孩子。这段婚姻短暂而不幸，直截了当的说法就是艾克罗伊德太太嗜酒成性，婚后仅仅四年，就因酗酒而撒手人寰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nowadays we have revues, and the country squire has died out of musical fashion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现如今流行的都是针砭时弊的滑稽剧，他这种乡绅形象渐渐淡出音乐剧舞台了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the years that followed, Ackroyd showed no disposition to make a second matrimonial adventure. His wife's child by her first marriage was only seven years old when his mother died. He is now twenty-five. Ackroyd has always regarded him as his own son, and has brought him up accordingly, but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry and trouble to his stepfather. Nevertheless we are all very fond of Ralph Paton in King's Abbot. He is such a good-looking youngster for one thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此后多年来，艾克罗伊德一直无意再娶。太太去世时，她第一次婚姻留下的那个孩子才七岁，今年他二十五岁。艾克罗伊德一直把他当成亲生儿子，悉心抚养成人，但这孩子性情顽劣，没少让继父操心。尽管如此，村民们都很喜欢拉尔夫·佩顿，部分得归功于这小伙子长得一表人才。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I said before, we are ready enough to gossip in our village. Everybody noticed from the first that Ackroyd and Mrs Ferrars got on very well together. After her husband's death, the intimacy became more marked. They were always seen about together, and it was freely conjectured that at the end of her period of mourning, Mrs Ferrars would become Mrs Roger Ackroyd. It was felt, indeed, that there was a certain fitness in the thing. Roger Ackroyd's wife had admittedly died of drink. Ashley Ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his death. It was only fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess should make up to each other for all that they had previously endured at the hands of their former spouses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚才说过，村里人人都爱嚼舌根，所以艾克罗伊德与弗拉尔斯太太的密切往来一开始就被大家看在眼里。弗拉尔斯先生去世后，这段暧昧关系就更加明显了。两人频频出双入对，人们纷纷猜测，等不到服丧期结束，弗拉尔斯太太就要摇身变为罗杰·艾克罗伊德太太了。说来也巧，众所周知，罗杰·艾克罗伊德的前任太太死于贪杯，而阿什利·弗拉尔斯死前也当了好多年酒鬼。两位被酒精夺去配偶的人同病相怜地走到一起，倒也不失为一桩美事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago, but a halo of gossip has surrounded Ackroyd for many years past. All the time that Ralph Paton was growing up to manhood a series of lady housekeepers presided over Ackroyd's establishment, and each in turn was regarded with lively suspicion by Caroline and her cronies. It is not too much to say that for at least fifteen years the whole village has confidently expected Ackroyd to marry one of his housekeepers. The last of them, a redoubtable lady called Miss Russell, has reigned undisputed for five years, twice as long as any of her predecessors. It is felt that but for the advent of Mrs Ferrars, Ackroyd could hardly have escaped. That -- and one other factor -- the unexpected arrival of a widowed sister-in-law with her daughter from Canada. Mrs Cecil Ackroyd, widow of Ackroyd's ne'er-do-well younger brother, has taken up her residence at Fernley Park, and has succeeded, according to Caroline, in putting Miss Russell in her proper place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗拉尔斯夫妇来村里只有一年多一点，但围绕艾克罗伊德的飞短流长早已盛传多年。在拉尔夫·佩顿长大成人的过程中，艾克罗伊德家先后经历过好几位女管家，每一位都被卡洛琳和她那群朋友煞有介事地怀疑过。保守估计，至少在十五年时间里，全村人都坚信艾克罗伊德会娶他的某位女管家为妻。现任女管家拉塞尔小姐是位令人敬畏的女士，稳坐管家之位长达五年，在职时间比她任何一位前任都长一倍有余。大家都觉得，如果没有弗拉尔斯太太插一脚，艾克罗伊德必定逃不出拉塞尔小姐的手心；还有一条小道消息：艾克罗伊德那位守寡的弟媳没打招呼就带着女儿从加拿大跑来了。艾克罗伊德的弟弟没什么出息，塞西尔·艾克罗伊德太太以遗孀的身份在芬利庄园定居。按卡洛琳的说法，她成功地让拉塞尔小姐“安分下来”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know exactly what a "proper place" constitutes -- it sounds chilly and unpleasant -- but I know that Miss Russell goes about with pinched lips, and what I can only describe as an acid smile, and that she professes the utmost sympathy for "poor Mrs Ackroyd -- dependent on the charity of her husband's brother. The bread of charity is so bitter, is it not? should be quite miserable if I did not work for my living."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我搞不清楚“安分下来”具体是什么意思——听起来有点令人不快——但我知道，拉塞尔小姐紧抿双唇的神情不啻为一种讥笑。她还公开表示极为同情“可怜的艾克罗伊德太太——还得靠大伯的施舍过日子，寄人篱下的滋味能好受吗？如果我养活不了自己，那可太惨了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't know what Mrs Cecil Ackroyd thought of the Ferrars affair when it came on the tapis. It was clearly to her advantage that Ackroyd should remain unmarried. She was always very charming -- not to say gushing -- to Mrs Ferrars when they met. Caroline says that proves less than nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知当艾克罗伊德与弗拉尔斯太太的私情公开化之后，塞西尔·艾克罗伊德太太心中是什么滋味。艾克罗伊德保持独身显然对她比较有利。每次见到弗拉尔斯太太时，她总表现得极为热络，大献殷勤。卡洛琳说那根本不能证明什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Revolving these and sundry other matters in my mind, I went mechanically on my round. I had no cases of special interest to attend, which was, perhaps, as well, for my thoughts returned again and again to the mystery of Mrs Ferrars's death. Had she taken her own life? Surely, if she had done so, she would have left some word behind to say what she contemplated doing? Women, in my experience, if they once reach the determination to commit suicide, usually wish to reveal the state of mind that led to the fatal action. They covet the limelight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我整理了一遍思绪，按惯例外出巡诊。今天没有需要特别关照的病人，因此我的思路一次又一次回到弗拉尔斯太太突然身亡之谜上。她是自杀吗？当然，如果她确系自杀，一定会留下只言片语交代遗愿吧？按我的经验，女人都渴望站到聚光灯下。如果下决心自尽，通常都会公布将自己推上绝路的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I suddenly remembered that I had seen her, though not to speak to, only yesterday. She had been walking with Ralph Paton, and I had been surprised because I had had no idea that he was likely to be in King's Abbot. I thought, indeed, that he had quarrelled finally with his stepfather. Nothing had been seen of him down here for nearly six months. They had been walking along, side by side, their heads close together, and she had been talking very earnestly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后我突然记起昨天还见过她，虽然并未交谈。她当时正与拉尔夫·佩顿走在一起。我很吃惊，因为我完全没料到他会在金斯艾伯特现身，毕竟他之前和继父大吵一架，几乎有六个月都没在村里露过面。他们一直肩并肩走着，脑袋挨得很近，她很认真地说个没完。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I nodded, and he hurried away, leaving me wondering. Ralph in London? But he had certainly been in King's Abbot the preceding afternoon.

He had spoken as though Ralph had not been near the place for months.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't think it would either, but I protested in duty bound. After all, it couldn't do any harm, and one must stick up for the tools of one's trade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也觉得这药没用，不过职责使然，免不了要表示反对。不管怎么说，搽点药总没坏处，何况人总得为自己的饭碗说几句话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, thank you very much for this bottle of liniment, doctor," she said at last. "Not that I believe it will do the least good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，多谢您给我开了这瓶搽剂，医生，”她最后说，“其实我不太相信它有什么用。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't believe in all these drugs," said Miss Russell, her eyes sweeping over my array of bottles disparagingly. "Drugs do a lot of harm. Look at the cocaine habit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些药我通通信不过，”拉塞尔小姐轻蔑的目光扫过架子上那一排药瓶，“是药三分毒，看看那些瘾君子就知道了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just tell me this, doctor," said Miss Russell. "Suppose you are really a slave of the drug habit, is there any cure?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“告诉我，医生，”拉塞尔小姐说，“假如真的染上了毒瘾，有什么方法戒掉吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One cannot answer a question like that off-hand. I gave her a short lecture on the subject, and she listened with close attention. I still suspected her of seeking information about Mrs Ferrars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种问题可不是随随便便就能答上来的。我简单地讲解了一下，她聚精会神地听着。我依然怀疑她企图打听弗拉尔斯太太的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, strangely enough, she didn't seem interested in veronal. Instead she changed the subject, and asked me if it was true that there were certain poisons so rare as to baffle detection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪，她似乎对镇静剂兴味索然，反而忽然话锋一转，问我是否有哪种罕见的毒药能够逃过检验。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I told her a good deal about curare, but she seemed to have lost interest once more. She asked me if I had any in my poison cupboard, and when I replied in the negative I fancy I fell in her estimation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我向她详细介绍箭毒的特性，但她似乎又一次失去兴趣。她问我在我的药柜中有没有箭毒，我回答没有，想来这也在她意料之内。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The essence of a detective story," I said, "is to have a rare poison -- if possible something from South America, that nobody has ever heard of- something that one obscure tribe of savages use to poison their arrows with. Death is instantaneous, and Western science is powerless to detect it. Is that the kind of thing you mean?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“侦探小说里总有稀奇古怪的毒药，”我说，“从南美洲弄来些人们闻所未闻的东西——比如某个离奇的野人部落把药抹在箭头上，瞬间就能置人于死地，连西方的先进科学都无法查验出来。你是指这一类东西吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. Is there really such a thing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，世上到底有没有呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shook my head regretfully. "I'm afraid there isn't. There's curare, of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我遗憾地摇摇头：“恐怕没有。当然，有一种名叫箭毒的毒药。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah!" I said. "You've been reading detective stories." She admitted that she had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！”我说，“你最近在读侦探小说。”她承认确实在读。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I should never have suspected Miss Russell of a fondness for detective stories. It pleases me very much to think of her stepping out of the housekeeper's room to rebuke a delinquent housemaid, and then returning to a comfortable perusal of The Mystery of the Seventh Death, or something of the kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我毫不怀疑拉塞尔小姐是个侦探小说迷，并饶有兴致地在脑子里勾勒出如下场景：她走出管家的房间，将某个失职的女仆斥责一番，然后返身回屋继续津津有味地阅读《第七次死亡之谜》，或是诸如此类的其他小说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She said she must be getting back, and I saw her out at the surgery door just as the luncheon gong went.</div>
