<div class="line_en">Sam did not know how long it had been since last he'd slept, but scarce an inch remained of the fat tallow candle he'd lit when starting on the ragged bundle of loose pages that he'd found tied up in twine. He was beastly tired, but it was hard to stop. One more book, he had told himself, then I'll stop. One more folio, just one more. One more page, then I'll go up and rest and get a bite to eat. But there was always another page after that one, and another after that, and another book waiting underneath the pile. I'll just take a quick peek to see what this one is about, he'd think, and before he knew he would be halfway through it. He had not eaten since that bowl of bean-and-bacon soup with Pyp and Grenn. Well, except for the bread and cheese, but that was only a nibble, he thought. That was when he took a quick glance at the empty platter, and spied the mouse feasting on the bread crumbs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mouse was half as long as his pinky finger, with black eyes and soft grey fur. Sam knew he ought to kill it. Mice might prefer bread and cheese, but they ate paper too. He had found plenty of mouse droppings amongst the shelves and stacks, and some of the leather covers on the books showed signs of being gnawed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老鼠有他粉红色的手指头一半那么长，黑眼睛，软灰毛。山姆知道自己应该杀死它。老鼠偏爱面包奶酪，但它们也啃嚼纸张。他曾在架子和书堆里发现大量老鼠屎，许多皮革封面呈现出咬啮的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After hours in the chair Sam's back was stiff as a board, and his legs were half-asleep. He knew he was not quick enough to catch the mouse, but it might be he could squash it. By his elbow rested a massive leather-bound copy of Annals of the Black Centaur, Septon Jorquen's exhaustively detailed account of the nine years that Orbert Caswell had served as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. There was a page for each day of his term, every one of which seemed to begin, "Lord Orbert rose at dawn and moved his bowels," except for the last, which said, "Lord Orbert was found to have died during the night."</div>

<div class="line_en">Pushing himself to his feet, Sam grimaced at the pins and needles in his calves. The chair was very hard and cut into the back of his thighs when he bent over a book. I need to remember to bring a cushion. It would be even better if he could sleep down here, in the cell he'd found half-hidden behind four chests full of loose pages that had gotten separated from the books they belonged to, but he did not want to leave Maester Aemon alone for so long. He had not been strong of late and required help, especially with the ravens. Aemon had Clydas, to be sure, but Sam was younger, and better with the birds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆艰难地站起来，露出痛苦的表情，小腿麻麻的，犹如针刺一般。他坐的椅子十分坚硬，当他弯腰去取书时，会压得腿部不舒服。我得记着带垫子。假如能睡在底下就更好了。他在四只装满零散书页（全部来自已经失传的著作）的箱子后面发现了一个半隐藏的地窖，这是个理想地点，但他不能撇下伊蒙师傅太久。学士最近身体不好，需要照料，此外还有乌鸦呢。伊蒙身边固然有克莱达斯，但山姆更年轻，鸟儿也更喜欢他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was surprised at how low the candle had burned. Had the bean-and-bacon soup been today or yesterday? Yesterday. It must have been yesterday. The realization made him yawn. Jon would be wondering what had become of him, though Maester Aemon would no doubt understand. Before he had lost his sight, the maester had loved books as much as Samwell Tarly did. He understood the way that you could sometimes fall right into them, as if each page was a hole into another world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很惊讶蜡烛已快烧完了，不晓得喝培根豌豆汤是今天还是昨天的事？昨天。一定是昨天。意识到这点，他打了个哈欠。琼恩不会明白他的心情，但伊蒙师傅会帮他解释。学士失明之前，跟山姆威尔·塔利一样酷爱读书。他能明白，当你深陷入书本中时，仿佛每一页都是通往其他世界的通道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No mouse is a match for Septon Jorquen. Very slowly, Sam took hold of the book with his left hand. It was thick and heavy, and when he tried to lift it one-handed, it slipped from his plump fingers and thumped back down. The mouse was gone in half a heartbeat, skittery-quick. Sam was relieved. Squishing the poor little thing would have given him nightmares. "You shouldn't eat the books, though," he said aloud. Maybe he should bring more cheese the next time he came down here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不能让老鼠毁了乔昆修士的辛苦成果。山姆的左手极其缓慢地伸向那本书。书又厚又重，他试图单手举起来，结果却从他肥胖的指间滑落，“砰”的一声砸下。老鼠转瞬间便逃窜得不见踪影。山姆松了口气。砸死这可怜的小东西会让他做噩梦的。“但你不该吃书。”他大声说。也许下次下来时，他该多带些奶酪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He emerged beneath a sky the color of white lead. A snow sky, Sam thought, squinting up. The prospect made him uneasy. He remembered that night on the Fist of the First Men when the wights and the snows had come together. Don't be so craven, he thought. You have your Sworn Brothers all around you, not to mention Stannis Baratheon and all his knights. Castle Black's keeps and towers rose about him, dwarfed by the icy immensity of the Wall. A small army was crawling over the ice a quarter of the way up, where a new switchback stair was creeping upward to meet the remnants of the old one. The sounds of their saws and hammers echoed off the ice. Jon had the builders working night and day on the task. Sam had heard some of them complaining about it over supper, insisting that Lord Mormont never worked them half so hard. Without the great stair there was no way to reach the top of the Wall except by the chain winch, however. And as much as Samwell Tarly hated steps, he hated the winch cage more. He always closed his eyes when he was riding it, convinced that the chain was about to break. Every time the iron cage scraped against the ice his heart stopped beating for an instant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空是铅白的颜色。看样子要下雪，山姆抬头斜睨，心里想。这让他感到不安。他记得先民拳峰上那个夜晚，记得伴随漫天大雪而来的尸鬼军团。不要随时随地都像个胆小鬼，他责怪自己，现在你周围有那么多誓言效命的兄弟，更不用说史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩和他的骑士们了。黑城堡的堡垒和塔楼在他面前耸立，但与硕大无朋的冰墙相比，显得渺小不堪。一支小队伍攀附于冰墙四分之一高处，正在修建一段新的之字形楼梯，并与旧梯子相连。锯子与铁锤的声响在冰面上回荡。琼恩让工匠们日夜赶工，山姆在晚餐时听见有人抱怨，说莫尔蒙大人决不会如此压榨劳力。然而要是没有梯子，除了绞盘铁笼，别无他法可以上长城，遇有情况会措手不及。虽然山姆威尔·塔利痛恨楼梯，但他更痛恨铁笼子，乘坐时，他总是闭起眼睛，相信链子马上就要断掉。每当铁笼擦刮冰面，他的心跳就会陡然停止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a stack of books and scrolls under his left arm and the candle in his right hand, Sam made his way through the tunnels the brothers called the wormways. A pale shaft of light illuminated the steep stone steps that led up to the surface, so he knew that day had come up top. He left the candle burning in a wall niche and began the climb. By the fifth step he was puffing. At the tenth he stopped to shift the books to his right arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是山姆左腋下夹着一堆书籍和卷轴，右手拿着蜡烛，穿过被弟兄们称为“虫道”的隧道，返回黑城堡。一束淡淡的光线照亮了通向地表的陡峭石阶，因而他知道上面已是白昼。他将蜡烛留在墙上的凹洞里，然后攀登。走到第五步，他喘起粗气；到了第十步，他停下来把书换到右腋下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were dragons here two hundred years ago, Sam found himself thinking, as he watched the cage making a slow descent. They would just have flown to the top of the Wall. Queen Alysanne had visited Castle Black on her dragon, and Jaehaerys, her king, had come after her on his own. Could Silverwing have left an egg behind? Or had Stannis found one egg on Dragonstone? Even if he has an egg, how can he hope to quicken it? Baelor the Blessed had prayed over his eggs, and other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery. All they got for it was farce and tragedy.</div>

He had come to the Wall big but slow, thick of neck, thick of waist, red of face, and clumsy. Though his neck still reddened when Pyp twisted him around into some folly, hours of work with sword and shield had flattened his belly, hardened his arms, broadened his chest. He was strong, and shaggy as an aurochs too. "Ulmer was expecting you at the butts."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ulmer," Sam said, abashed. Almost the first thing Jon Snow had done as Lord Commander was institute daily archery drill for the entire garrison, even stewards and cooks. The Watch had been placing too much emphasis on the sword and too little on the bow, he had said, a relic of the days when one brother in every ten had been a knight, instead of one in every hundred. Sam saw the sense in the decree, but he hated longbow practice almost as much as he hated climbing steps. When he wore his gloves he could never hit anything, but when he took them off he got blisters on his fingers. Those bows were dangerous. Satin had torn off half his thumbnail on a bowstring. "I forgot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乌尔马。”山姆窘迫地重复道。琼恩·雪诺当上总司令后做的第一件事，就是让所有弟兄每天操练箭术，即使事务官和厨师也不例外。他认为，从前的守夜人军团过于强调剑术，而不注重弓箭，在每十人就有一个是骑士的时代当然有道理，但在每一百人当中才有一个骑士的目前却显得不合时宜了。山姆支持这道命令，但他讨厌练习长弓几乎就跟讨厌爬楼梯一样。他戴上手套便射不中任何目标，脱掉手套指头就会起泡。弓箭是危险的东西。纱丁曾在弓弦上绷裂了半个拇指甲盖。“我忘了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was true, Sam had to admit. Once, when Jon came to consult with Maester Aemon, Sam had asked him why he spent so much time at swordplay. "The Old Bear never trained much when he was Lord Commander," he had pointed out. In answer, Jon had pressed Longclaw into Sam's hand. He let him feel the lightness, the balance, had him turn the blade so that ripples gleamed in the smoke-dark metal. "Valyrian steel," he said, "spell-forged and razor-sharp, nigh on indestructible.

And the really old books… either they have crumbled all away or they are buried somewhere that I haven't looked yet or… well, it could be that there are no such books, and never were. The oldest histories we have were written after the Andals came to Westeros. The First Men only left us runes on rocks, so everything we think we know about the Age of Heroes and the Dawn Age and the Long Night comes from accounts set down by septons thousands of years later. There are archmaesters at the Citadel who question all of it. Those old histories are full of kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights riding around a thousand years before there were knights. You know the tales, Brandon the Builder, Symeon Star-Eyes, Night's King… we say that you're the nine hundred and ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, but the oldest list I've found shows six hundred seventy-four commanders, which suggests that it was written during…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I found mention of dragonglass. The children of the forest used to give the Night's Watch a hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes. The Others come when it is cold, most of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night… or else night falls when they emerge. Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of dead animals. Bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is dead. The one that killed Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part's plainly true. Some accounts speak of giant ice spiders too. I don't know what those are. Men who fall in battle against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="黎明前一小时，黑暗沉寂，黑城堡宁静得出奇。墓地里，两辆双轮拖车在等他，还有黑杰克·布尔威和十几个经验丰富的游骑兵，他们就像他们的矮种马坐骑一样结实强硬。白眼肯基用那只完好的眼睛看见了山姆，便大声诅咒起来。“别理他，杀手，”黑杰克说，“他赌输了，他说我们需要把尖叫着的你从床底下拽出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning, Sam found himself saddling the mare he'd ridden from Horn Hill and leading her toward the lichyard beside the eastern road. Her saddlebags bulged with cheese and sausages and hard-cooked eggs, and half a salted ham that Three-Finger Hobb had given him on his name day. "You're a man who appreciates cooking, Slayer," the cook had said. "We need more o' your sort." The ham would help, no doubt. Eastwatch was a long cold ride away, and there were no towns nor inns in the shadow of the Wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，山姆发现自己在为马上鞍，他曾骑着这匹母马从角陵一路来到这里。随后，他牵它沿着向东方的道路，朝墓地走去。鞍囊里鼓鼓囊囊的塞满了奶酪、香肠、熟鸡蛋，还有半只腌火腿——这火腿是三指哈布在他命名日时送他的礼物。“你小子懂得欣赏厨艺，杀手。”厨子说，“你这样的人多些就好了。”火腿是无价之宝，去东海望的路冰冷漫长，而长城的阴影下没有村镇，也没有客栈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Snow," a raven muttered. "Snow," another echoed. All of them picked it up then. "Snow, snow, snow, snow, snow." Sam had taught them that word. There was no help here, he saw. Maester Aemon was as trapped as he was. He will die at sea, he thought, despairing. He is too old to survive such a voyage. Gilly's little son may die as well, he's not as large and strong as Dalla's boy. Does Jon mean to kill us all?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雪诺。”一只乌鸦低声说。“雪诺。”另一只附和道。然后所有的乌鸦都跟着叫起来，“雪诺，雪诺，雪诺，雪诺，雪诺。”是山姆教会了他们这个词，所以在这里他注定得不到支持。他认为伊蒙学士跟他一样进退两难。他会死在海上，他绝望地想，他年纪太大，很难度过这段旅途。吉莉的婴儿也可能会夭折，他个子不若达拉的儿子那么大，也没那么强壮。琼恩是想除掉我们吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The blind man nodded as the wind pushed back their hoods. "It is always warm in Oldtown. There is an inn on an island in the Honeywine where I used to go when I was a young novice. It will be pleasant to sit there once again, sipping cider."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盲人点点头，风又掀开了他们的兜帽。“旧镇总是很暖和。蜜酒河中有座小岛，上面有家客栈，我还是个年轻学徒时常去那里。若能再坐在那儿呷苹果酒，一定很惬意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maester Aemon was too frail to ride a horse, so a wayn had been made ready for him, its bed heaped high with furs, and a leather awning fastened overhead to keep off the rain and snow. Gilly and her child would ride with him. The second wayn would carry their clothing and possessions, along with a chest of rare old books that Aemon thought the Citadel might lack. Sam had spent half the night searching for them, though he'd found only one in four. And a good thing, or we'd need another wayn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊蒙学士身子太弱，骑不了马，有一辆拖车便是为他准备的。车板上兽皮堆得老高，顶上固定着皮革顶篷，以遮挡雨雪。吉莉和她的孩子将跟他一起乘坐。第二辆拖车负责运载衣物，还有一箱伊蒙认为学城或会缺少的稀有古书。山姆照着师傅列出的名单，花了半个晚上，才找到其中四分之一。这是件好事，否则我们还需要一辆车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the maester appeared, he was bundled up in a bearskin three times his size. As Clydas led him toward the wayn, a gust of wind came up, and the old man staggered. Sam hurried to his side and put an arm about him. Another gust like that could blow him over the Wall. "Keep hold of my arm, maester. It's not far."</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time they got the maester into the wayn, Gilly had appeared, the child bundled in her arms. Beneath her hood her eyes were red from crying. Jon turned up at the same time, with Dolorous Edd. "Lord Snow," Maester Aemon called, "I left a book for you in my chambers. The Jade Compendium. It was written by the Volantene adventurer Colloquo Votar, who traveled to the east and visited all the lands of the Jade Sea. There is a passage you may find of interest. I've told Clydas to mark it for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他们把学士安顿到车上，吉莉怀抱着襁褓出现了。兜帽底下，她眼睛哭得红红的。琼恩与忧郁的艾迪也同时赶到。“雪诺大人，”学士招呼，“我在我房里为你留了一本《玉海概述》，由瓦兰提斯冒险家柯洛阔·弗塔所著，他曾到东方旅行，造访过玉海内外所有土地。其中有一段你也许会感兴趣，我让克莱达斯标了出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You do the same, m'lord," said Gilly. "You do the same for t'other. Find another wet nurse, like you said. You promised me you would. The boy… Dalla's boy… the little prince, I mean… you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您也是，大人，”吉莉说，“您对另一个孩子也要一视同仁。替他再找个奶妈，正如您答应我的。那男孩…达拉的儿子…我是说，小王子…你要给他找个好女人，让他长得高大强壮。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A line of pale snot ran from Maester Aemon's nose. He wiped it away with the back of his glove. "Knowledge is a weapon, Jon. Arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle."</div>

"Make as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks. You have an old man and a suckling babe with you. See that you keep them warm and well fed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会谨记。”这时，天空中下起小雪，朵朵柔软的雪花缓缓飘落。琼恩转向黑杰克·布尔威。“尽量加快速度，但别冒愚蠢的风险。你带着老人和婴儿，要照顾好他们，保证他们穿暖吃饱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dolorous Edd took the babe as Gilly climbed into the wayn and covered her legs with some musty pelts. By then the eastern sky was more grey than black. Left Hand Lew was anxious to be off. Edd handed the infant up and Gilly put him to her breast. This may be the last I ever see of Castle Black, thought Sam as he hoisted himself atop his mare. As much as he had once hated Castle Black, it was tearing him apart to leave it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忧郁的艾迪接过孩子，让吉莉爬进拖车，用发霉的兽皮盖住双腿。东方的天空已由黑变灰，“左手”卢急于出发。艾迪把婴儿递上，吉莉将他抱在胸口吃奶。这也许是我最后一次看到黑城堡了，山姆一边想，一边爬上母马。尽管他一度很讨厌黑城堡，离别却让他难受得如同被生生撕裂。">查看中文翻译</div>
