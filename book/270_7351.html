<div class="line_en">I sat up, sliding to the end of the sofa to make room. My stomach twisted nervously as the one Cullen who did not like me moved silently to sit down in the open space. I tried to come up with a reason why she would want to see me, but my mind was a blank on that point.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was my mother's job to keep our house -- and myself and my two younger brothers -- in spotless order. It was clear that I was both her first priority and her favorite. I didn't fully understand at the time, but I was always vaguely aware that my parents weren't satisfied with what they had, even if it was so much more than most. They wanted more. They had social aspirations -- social climbers, I suppose you could call them. My beauty was like a gift to them. They saw so much more potential in it than I did."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我母亲的工作就是操持家务——照顾我和两个弟弟——使房屋一尘不染，一切井然有序。显然我不仅是她最优先考虑的对象，也是她最喜欢的。那时候我并不完全明白，但是我一直模糊地意识到我的父母对他们已经拥有的并不满足，哪怕他们已经比大多数人拥有的都要多得多。他们还想要更多，他们的社会野心——想方设法挤进上流社会的人，我猜你会这样称呼他们。我的美丽对他们像是一种恩赐，他们认为美丽具有更多的潜力，比我看见的要多得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My parents were thoroughly middle class. My father had a stable job in a bank, something I realize now that he was smug about -- he saw his prosperity as a reward for talent and hard work, rather than acknowledging the luck involved. I took it all for granted then; in my home, it was as if the Great Depression was only a troublesome rumor. Of course I saw the poor people, the ones who weren't as lucky. My father left me with the impression that they'd brought their troubles on themselves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的父母是彻头彻尾的中产阶级，我父亲在银行有份稳定的工作，还有我现在才意识到的他引以为傲的事——他把自己的富裕生活当成是对天赋与辛勤工作的回报，而不是承认其中也有运气的成分。那时候我也认为理所当然。在我家好像大萧条只不过是令人烦恼的流言飞语一样。当然我也看见过穷苦的人们，那些不是那么幸运的人。我的父亲给我留下的印象是他们的麻烦是自己找来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And I didn't see any reason why I wouldn't get these things."</div>

Delighted that my girlfriends sighed with envy when they touched my hair. Happy that my mother was proud of me and that my father liked to buy me pretty dresses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们毫不满足，但是我很心满意足。成为我自己——成为罗莎莉？黑尔令我感到兴奋不已。男人们的目光追随着我的步伐，从我十二岁那年就开始这样了，我为此感到高兴万分。当我的女性朋友们触碰一下我的头发都要发出叹息之声的时候，我也会感到欣喜若狂。我母亲为我感到自豪，我父亲喜欢给我买漂亮的衣服，这都让我备感幸福。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I wanted to have a huge, flowery wedding, where everyone in town would watch me walk down the aisle on my father's arm and think I was the most beautiful thing they'd ever seen. Admiration was like air to me, Bella. I was silly and shallow, but I was content." She smiled, amused at her own evaluation."</div>

She married a man my parents would never have considered for me -- a carpenter. A year later she had a son, a beautiful little boy with dimples and curly black hair. It was the first time I'd ever felt truly jealous of anyone else in my entire life."</div>

With a slight shock, I realized that this was very close to the world that Edward would have experienced when he was human, the world he had grown up in. I wondered -- while Rosalie sat silent for a moment -- if my world seemed as baffling to him as Rosalie's did to me?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我并没有注意到罗伊斯注视我的眼神有什么特别之处。每个人都关注我，但是那天晚上，首先送来的是玫瑰花，每天晚上我们卿卿我我的时候，他都会送给我一束玫瑰。我的房间里到处都插着这样的花儿，我走出房间，身上几乎都要散发出玫瑰花的香味了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In Rochester, there was one royal family -- the Kings, ironically enough. Royce King owned the bank my father worked at, and nearly every other really profitable business in town. That's how his son, Royce King the Second" -- her mouth twisted around the name, it came out through her teeth -- "saw me the first time. He was going to take over at the bank, and so he began overseeing the different positions. Two days later, my mother conveniently forgot to send my father's lunch to work with him. I remember being confused when she insisted that I wear my white organza and roll my hair up just to run over to the bank." Rosalie laughed without humor.</div>

"Her little Henry really was adorable, all smiles and dimples -- he was just sitting up on his own. Vera walked me to the door as I was leaving, her baby in her arms and her husband at her side, his arm around her waist. He kissed her on the cheek when he thought I wasn't looking. That bothered me.

<div class="line_en">"I got luckier than I deserved. Emmett is everything I would have asked for if I'd known myself well enough to know what to ask for. He's exactly the kind of person someone like me needs. And, oddly enough, he needs me, too. That part worked out better than I could have hoped. But there will never be more than the two of us. And I'll never sit on a porch somewhere, with him gray-haired by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren."</div>

<div class="line_en">Her smile was kind now. "That sounds quite bizarre to you, doesn't it? In some ways, you are much more mature than I was at eighteen. But in other ways… there are many things you've probably never thought about seriously. You're too young to know what you'll want in ten years, fifteen years -- and too young to give it all up without thinking it through. You don't want to be rash about permanent things, Bella." She patted my head, but the gesture didn't feel condescending.</div>
