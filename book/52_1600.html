<div class="line_en">Only not here, not quite yet. It's essential to get back to District 12, because the main part of any plan will include my mother and sister, Gale and his family. And Peeta, if I can get him to come with us. I add Haymitch to the list. These are the people I must take with me when I escape into the wild. How I will convince them, where we will go in the dead of winter, what it will take to evade capture are unanswered questions. But at least now I know what Imust do.</div>

<div class="line_en">In that one slight motion, I see the end of hope, the beginning of the destruction of everything I hold dear in the world. I can't guess what form my punishment will take, how wide the net will be cast, but when it is finished, there will most likely be nothing left. So you would think that at this moment, I would be in utter despair. Here's what's strange. The main thing I feel is a sense of relief. That I can give up this game. That the question of whether I can succeed in this venture has been answered, even if that answer is a resounding no. That if desperate times call for desperate measures, then I am free to act as desperately as I wish.</div>

<div class="line_en">So instead of crumpling to the ground and weeping, I find myself standing up straighter and with more confidence than I have in weeks. My smile, while somewhat insane, is not forced. And when President Snow silences the audience and says, "What do you think about us throwing them a wedding right here in the Capitol?" I pull off girl-almost-catatonic-with-joy without a hitch.</div>

<div class="line_en">The party, held in the banquet room of President Snow's mansion, has no equal. The forty-foot ceiling has been transformed into the night sky, and the stars look exactly as they do at home. I suppose they look the same from the Capitol, but who would know? There's always too much light from the city to see the stars here. About halfway between the floor and the ceiling, musicians float on what look like fluffy white clouds, but I can't see what holds them aloft. Traditional dining tables have been replaced by innumerable stuffed sofas and chairs, some surrounding fireplaces, others beside fragrant flower gardens or ponds filled with exotic fish, so that people can eat and drink and do whatever they please in the utmost comfort. There's a large tiled area in the center of the room that serves as everything from a dance floor, to a stage for the performers who come and go, to another spot to mingle with the flamboyantly dressed guests.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the real star of the evening is the food. Tables laden with delicacies line the walls. Everything you can think of, and things you have never dreamed of, lie in wait. Whole roasted cows and pigs and goats still turning on spits. Huge platters of fowl stuffed with savory fruits and nuts. Ocean creatures drizzled in sauces or begging to be dipped in spicy concoctions. Countless cheeses, breads, vegetables, sweets, waterfalls of wine, and streams of spirits that flicker with flames.</div>

<div class="line_en">I can see him trying to read my expression, to figure out my transformation. Since he doesn't know that President Snow thinks I have failed, he can only assume that I think we have succeeded. Perhaps even that I have some genuine happiness at our engagement. His eyes reflect his puzzlement but only briefly, because we're on camera. "Then you'd better pace yourself," he says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不解地看着我，对于我的变化感到吃惊。因为他并不知道斯诺总统认定我们已经失败，因而他只能猜测是我们赢了，他甚至可能猜想我对这项活动有点喜欢。他眼睛里闪过了一丝疑虑，但很快就过去了，因为我们处于摄像机镜头之下。“那你可得慢慢来了。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta and I make no effort to find company but are constantly sought out. We are what no one wants to miss at the party. I act delighted, but I have zero interest in these Capitol people. They are only distractions from the food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔和我并没有刻意与人搭讪，可总有人把我们认出来。我们成了大家在宴会上不容错过的目标。我表现得热情大方，但其实对那些凯匹特人丝毫不感兴趣，他们只不过分散了我对食物的注意力而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay, no more than one bite of each dish," I say. My resolve is almost immediately broken at the first table, which has twenty or so soups, when I encounter a creamy pumpkin brew sprinkled with slivered nuts and tiny black seeds. "I could just eat this all night!" I exclaim. But I don't. I weaken again at a clear green broth that I can only describe as tasting like springtime, and again when I try a frothy pink soup dotted with raspberries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，每种菜只吃一口。”我说。可当我来到第一张摆放着足有二十来种汤的餐桌旁，看到撒满长条果仁和小黑芝麻的奶油南瓜汤时，我的决心几乎立刻瓦解。“光这个就够我消用一晚上的！”我喊道。可我并没有在那里待一晚上。我又看到一种清绿色的肉汤，我只能把它描述为具有春天的味道，接着我又品尝了一种带泡沫的粉色的汤，里面满是草莓丁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Faces appear, names are exchanged, pictures taken, kisses brushed on cheeks. Apparently my mockingjay pin has spawned a new fashion sensation, because several people come up to show me their accessories. My bird has been replicated on belt buckles, embroidered into silk lapels, even tattooed in intimate places. Everyone wants to wear the winner's token. I can only imagine how nuts that makes President Snow. But what can he do? The Games were such a hit here, where the berries were only a symbol of a desperate girl trying to save her lover.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们来来往往、摩肩接踵，又是相互介绍、又是拍照、又是亲吻。显然，我的胸针成为新的时尚，有几个人走过来让我看她们的配饰。我的嘲笑鸟造型已经出现在腰带扣上、绣花丝绸衣领上；甚至有人做了文身。大家都纷纷效仿胜利者的吉祥物，我能想到的只是斯诺总统对这一切会多么恼火。可他又会怎样呢？饥饿游戏在此地引起轰动，浆果事件也不过是一个姑娘想要救出自己爱人的疯狂举动罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Every table presents new temptations, and even on my restricted one-taste-per-dish regimen, I begin filling up quickly. I pick up a small roasted bird, bite into it, and my tongue floods with orange sauce. Delicious. But I make Peeta eat the remainder because I want to keep tasting things, and the idea of throwing away food, as I see so many people doing so casually, is abhorrent to me. After about ten tables I'm stuffed, and we've only sampled a small number of the dishes available.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每张餐桌上都有各种诱人的食物，即使每种食物只吃一口，也需要快快品尝。我拿起一只烤鸽，咬了一口，舌尖立刻溢满了橋色酱汁。好吃。我把剩下的递给皮塔，因为我想接着品尝其他食物。像许多人那样把食物随手丢弃是我不能接受的，太可恶了。大约经过十个餐桌之后，我肚子撑得饱饱的，剩下的食物我们只品尝了一点点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Music filters down from the clouds as he leads me away from the team, the table, and out onto the floor. We know only a few dances at home, the kind that go with fiddle and flute music and require a good deal of space. But Effie has shown us some that are popular in the Capitol. The music's slow and dreamlike, so Peeta pulls me into his arms and we move in a circle with practically no steps at all. You could do this dance on a pie plate. We're quiet for a while. Then Peeta speaks in a strained voice. "You go along, thinking you can deal with it, thinking maybe they're not so bad, and then you --" He cuts himself off.</div>

<div class="line_en">All I can think of is the emaciated bodies of the children on our kitchen table as my mother prescribes what the parents can't give. More food. Now that we're rich, she'll send some home with them. But often in the old days, there was nothing to give and the child was past saving, anyway. And here in the Capitol they're vomiting for the pleasure of filling their bellies again and again. Not from some illness of body or mind, not from spoiled food. It's what everyone does at a party. Expected. Part of the fun.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day when I dropped by to give Hazelle the game, Vick was home sick with a bad cough. Being part of Gale's family, the kid has to eat better than ninety percent of the rest of District 12. But he still spent about fifteen minutes talking about how they'd opened a can of corn syrup from Parcel Day and each had a spoonful on bread and were going to maybe have more later in the week. How Hazelle had said he could have a bit in a cup of tea to soothe his cough, but he wouldn't feel right unless the others had some, too.

Only this one disappears. He snaps the watch closed.</div>

Maybe he thinks someone else will steal his idea of putting a disappearing mockingjay on a watch face. Yes, he probably paid a fortune for it and now he can't show it to anyone because he's afraid someone will make a cheap, knockoff version. Only in the Capitol.</div>

It turns out Madge has plenty of empty hours to fill, too. It was a little awkward at first because we didn't know what to do. Other girls our age, I've heard them talking about boys, or other girls, or clothes. Madge and I aren't gossipy and clothes bore me to tears. But after a few false starts, I realized she was dying to go into the woods, so I've taken her a couple of times and showed her how to shoot. She's trying to teach me the piano, but mostly I like to listen to her play. Sometimes we eat at each other's houses. Madge likes mine better.
