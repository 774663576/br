<div class="line_en">The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</div>

<div class="line_en">The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.</div>

<div class="line_en">He took off his glasses and held them out to Ralph, blinking and smiling, and then started to wipe them against his grubby wind-breaker.

<div class="line_en">The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar. Ralph stood, one hand against a grey trunk, and screwed up his eyes against the shimmering water. Out there, perhaps a mile away, the white surf flinked on a coral reef, and beyond that the open sea was dark blue. Within the irregular arc of coral the lagoon was still as a mountain lake -- blue of all shades and shadowy green and purple. The beach between the palm terrace and the water was a thin stick, endless apparently, for to Ralph's left the perspectives of palm and beach and water drew to a point at infinity; and always, almost visible, was the heat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海岸边长满棕榈。有的树身耸立着，有的树身向阳光偏斜着，绿色的树叶在空中高达一百英尺。树下是铺满粗壮杂草的斜堤，被乱七八糟的倒下的树划得东一道西一道的，还四散着腐烂的椰子和棕榈树苗。之后就是那黑压压的森林本体部分和孤岩的空旷地带。拉尔夫站着，一手靠着根灰树干，一面眯起眼睛看着粼波闪烁的海水。从这里往外约一英里之遥，雪白的浪花忽隐忽现地拍打[3]着一座珊瑚礁。再外面则是湛蓝的辽阔的大海。在珊瑚礁不规则的弧形圈里，环礁湖平静得像一个水潭——湖水呈现各种细微色差的蓝色、墨绿色和紫色。在长着棕榈树的斜坡和海水之间是一条狭窄的弓形板似的海滩，看上去像没有尽头，因为在拉尔夫的左面，棕榈、海滩和海水往外伸向无限远的一点；而几乎张眼就能看到的，则是一股腾腾的热气。【注：[3] 原文flinked，系作者所臆造的一个词。意谓flicker（摇曳），flick（轻弹声）和blink（闪烁）等词义的综合。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He jumped down from the terrace. The sand was thick over his black shoes and the heat hit him. He became conscious of the weight of clothes, kicked his shoes off fiercely and ripped off each stocking with its elastic garter in a single movement. Then he leapt back on the terrace, pulled off his shirt, and stood there among the skull-like coconuts with green shadows from the palms and the forest sliding over his skin. He undid the snake-clasp of his belt, lugged off his shorts and pants, and stood there naked, looking at the dazzling beach and the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫从斜坡上跳下去。沙子太厚，淹没了黑鞋子，热浪冲击着他。他觉得身上的衣服很重，猛地踢掉鞋，刷地扯下连同宽紧带的一双袜子。接着又跳回到斜坡上，扯下衬衫，站在一堆脑壳样的椰子当中，棕榈和森林的绿荫斜照到他的皮肤上。拉尔夫解开皮带的蛇形搭扣，用力地脱掉短裤和衬裤，光身子站在那儿，察看着耀眼的海滩和海水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was old enough, twelve years and a few months, to have lost the prominent tummy of childhood and not yet old enough for adolescence to have made him awkward. You could see now that he might make a boxer, as far as width and heaviness of shoulders went, but there was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil. He patted the palm trunk softly, and, forced at last to believe in the reality of the island laughed delightedly again and stood on his head. He turned neatly on to his feet, jumped down to the beach, knelt and swept a double armful of sand into a pile against his chest. Then he sat back and looked at the water with bright, excited eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫够大了，十二岁还多几个月，小孩子的凸肚子已经不见了；但还没大到那种开始感到难为情的青春期。就他的肩膀长得又宽又结实而言，看得出他完全可能成为一个拳击手，但他的嘴形和眼睛偏又流露出一种温厚的神色，表明他心地倒不坏。拉尔夫轻轻地拍拍棕榈树干，终于意识到这确实是个岛，又开心地笑笑，来了个拿大顶。他利索地翻身站起来，蹦到海滩上，跪下拨了两抱沙子，在胸前形成个沙堆。随之他往后一坐，闪亮而兴奋的眼睛直盯着海水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here the beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the landscape; a great platform of pink granite thrust up uncompromisingly through forest and terrace and sand and lagoon to make a raised jetty four feet high. The top of this was covered with a thin layer of soil and coarse grass and shaded with young palm trees. There was not enough soil for them to grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twenty feet they fell and dried, forming a criss-cross pattern of trunks, very convenient to sit on. The palms that still stood made a green roof, covered on the underside with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon. Ralph hauled himself onto this platform, noted the coolness and shade, shut one eye, and decided that the shadows on his body were really green. He picked his way to the seaward edge of the platform and stood looking down into the water. It was clear to the bottom and bright with the efflorescence of tropical weed and coral. A school of tiny, glittering fish flicked hither and thither. Ralph spoke to himself, sounding the bass strings of delight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这儿，海滩被成直角基调的地形猛地截断了；一大块粉红色的花岗岩平台不调和地直穿过森林、斜坡、沙滩和环礁湖，形成一个高达四英尺的突出部分。平台顶上覆盖着一层薄薄的泥土，上面长着粗壮的杂草和成荫的小棕榈树。因为没有充足的泥土让小树长个够，所以它们到二十英尺光景就倒下干死。树干横七竖八地交叠在一起，坐起来倒挺方便。依然挺立着的棕榈树形成了一个罩盖着地面的绿顶，里面闪耀着从环礁湖反射上来的颤动的散光。拉尔夫硬爬上平台，一下子就注意到了这儿凉快的绿荫，他闭上一只眼，心想落在身上的树叶的影子一定是绿色的，又择路走向平台朝海的一边，站在那里俯视着海水。水清见底，又因盛长热带的海藻和珊瑚而璀璨夺目。一群小小的、闪闪发光的鱼儿东游西窜、忽隐忽现。拉尔夫兴高采烈，他用带低音的嗓门，自言自语地说道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beyond the platform there was more enchantment. Some act of God -- a typhoon perhaps, or the storm that had accompanied his own arrival -- had banked sand inside the lagoon so that there was a long, deep pool in the beach with a high ledge of pink granite at the further end. Ralph had been deceived before now by the specious appearance of depth in a beach pool and he approached this one preparing to be disappointed. But the island ran true to form and the incredible pool, which clearly was only invaded by the sea at high tide, was so deep at one end as to be dark green. Ralph inspected the whole thirty yards carefully and then plunged in. The water was warmer than his blood and he might have been swimming in a huge bath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在平台外面还有更迷人的东西呢。某种不可抗拒的自然力量——也许是一场台风，或是伴随他自己一起到来的那场风暴——在环礁湖的里侧堆起了一道沙堤，因而在海滩里造成个长而深的水潭，较远一头是粉红色的花岗岩高高的突出部分。拉尔夫以前曾上过当：海滩水潭看上去深，其实不然。现在他走近这个水潭，本也没抱希望。这个岛却是一个真正的岛，而这个水潭是由海发大潮所造成的，它的一头深得呈墨绿色，使人难以置信。拉尔夫仔细地巡看了这整整三十码水面，接着一个猛子扎了进去。水比他的血还暖，拉尔夫就好像是在一个巨大的浴缸里游泳。">查看中文翻译</div>

He tiptoed down the sandy side of the pool, and sat there up to his neck in water smiling proudly at Ralph.</div>

<div class="line_en">Doubtfully, Ralph laid the small end of the shell against his mouth and blew. There came a rushing sound from its mouth but nothing more. Ralph wiped the salt water off his lips and tried again, but the shell remained silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫半信半疑，他把贝壳小的一头抵在嘴上吹起来。从贝壳嘴里冲出一阵急促的声音，可再没别的了。拉尔夫擦去嘴唇上的咸水，又试吹起来，但贝壳里仍然没有一点声音出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He kind of spat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他吹起来有点像吐唾沫似的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise. This amused both boys so much that Ralph went on squirting for some minutes, between bouts of laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫噘起嘴往里鼓气，贝壳呜地冒出一种低沉的、放屁似的声音。这下子可把两个男孩逗乐了，在一阵阵哈哈的笑声之中拉尔夫又使劲吹了几分钟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他从下面这儿使劲吹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ralph grasped the idea and hit the shell with air from his diaphragm. Immediately the thing sounded. A deep, harsh note boomed under the palms, spread through the intricacies of the forest and echoed back from the pink granite of the mountain. Clouds of birds rose from the treetops, and something squealed and ran in the undergrowth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫这才抓住了要点，运用横膈膜的气往贝壳里猛送。霎时那东西就响了。一种低沉而又刺耳的声音在掌心中嗡嗡作响，随后穿透杂乱无章的林海，到粉红色的花岗岩山才发出回声。成群的鸟儿从树梢上惊起，下层的林丛中则有什么动物在吱吱乱叫乱跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His ordinary voice sounded like a whisper after the harsh note of the conch. He laid the conch against his lips, took a deep breath and blew once more. The note boomed again: and then at his firmer pressure, the note, fluking up an octave, became a strident blare more penetrating than before. Piggy was shouting something, his face pleased, his glasses flashing. The birds cried, small animals scuttered. Ralph's breath failed; the note dropped the octave, became a low wubber, was a rush of air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听过海螺刺耳的声音后，他那平常的讲话声再听起来就像是悄声细语。他把海螺顶住嘴唇，深吸一口，又吹了一下。螺声再次嗡嗡作响，然后随着他越来越使劲，声音碰巧升高了一个八度，比刚才吹的一次更加刺耳。猪崽子哇哇地高喊，面带喜色，眼镜闪闪发亮。鸟儿在惊叫，小动物在急促地四散奔逃。拉尔夫接不上气了，海螺的声音又跌下了八度，变成一股低沉的呜呜气流[5]。【注：[5] 原文wubber，系作者臆造，拟声。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A child had appeared among the palms, about a hundred yards along the beach. He was a boy of perhaps six years, sturdy and fair, his clothes torn, his face covered with a sticky mess of fruit. His trousers had been lowered for an obvious purpose and had only been pulled back half-way. He jumped off the palm terrace into the sand and his trousers fell about his ankles; he stepped out of them and trotted to the platform. Piggy helped him up. Meanwhile Ralph continued to blow till voices shouted in the forest. The small boy squatted in front of Ralph, looking up brightly and vertically. As he received the reassurance of something purposeful being done he began to look satisfied, and his only clean digit, a pink thumb, slid into his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿海滩约一百码的棕榈树林里冒出了一个男孩子。他六岁上下，身体结实、头发金黄、衣衫褴褛，面孔则被黏糊糊的野果浆汁涂得一塌糊涂。为了某种显而易见的目的，他把裤子脱了下来，现在刚拉上一半。他从长着棕榈树的斜坡跳进沙滩，裤子又落到脚踝上；他一步步地走出沙滩，小步跑到平台。猪崽子在他上来的时候帮了把忙。与此同时，拉尔夫继续猛吹海螺，吹到林中响起了许多小孩的声音。小男孩朝拉尔夫面前一蹲，快活地仰起头来直望着拉尔夫。等到他肯定地知道他们将一道干点事情时，才流露出一种心满意足的神态，并把他唯一还算干净的指头，一只肉色的大拇指，放进了嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Piggy muttered the name to himself and then shouted it to Ralph, who was not interested because he was still blowing. His face was dark with the violent pleasure of making this stupendous noise, and his heart was making the stretched shirt shake. The shouting in the forest was nearer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猪崽子喃喃自语着这个名字，随后大声地说给拉尔夫听，而后者毫无兴趣，因为他还在使劲地吹海螺。拉尔夫紫涨着脸，为吹出这种巨大的声响而兴奋至极，他的心似乎跳得连敞开的衬衫也在颤动。森林中有片呼喊声越来越近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Signs of life were visible now on the beach. The sand, trembling beneath the heat haze, concealed many figures in its miles of length; boys were making their way toward the platform through the hot, dumb sand. Three small children, no older than Johnny, appeared from startlingly close at hand, where they had been gorging fruit in the forest. A dark little boy, not much younger than Piggy, parted a tangle of undergrowth, walked on to the platform, and smiled cheerfully at everybody. More and more of them came. Taking their cue from the innocent Johnny, they sat down on the fallen palm trunks and waited. Ralph continued to blow short, penetrating blasts. Piggy moved among the crowd, asking names and frowning to remember them. The children gave him the same simple obedience that they had given to the men with megaphones. Some were naked and carrying their clothes; others half-naked, or more or less dressed, in school uniforms, grey, blue, fawn, jacketed, or jerseyed. There were badges, mottoes even, stripes of color in stockings and pullovers. Their heads clustered above the trunks in the green shade; heads brown, fair, black, chestnut, sandy, mouse-colored; heads muttering, whispering, heads full of eyes that watched Ralph and speculated. Something was being done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海滩上此刻出现了一派生机勃勃的迹象。左右伸展开达几英里长、在暑热烟霭底下震颤着的沙滩上，时隐时现着许多人影；一群男孩子经过烫人而无声的海滩，正朝平台赶来。三个不比约翰尼大的小孩子从近得令人吃惊的地方突地冒了出来。他们方才一直在森林里狼吞虎咽地大嚼野果。一个肤色黝黑、不比猪崽子小多少的孩子，拨开一处矮灌木林丛钻出来，走到了平台上，愉快地朝大伙儿笑笑。越来越多的孩子们赶来了。他们从天真的约翰尼身上得到启示，坐等在倒下的棕榈树干上。拉尔夫继续不停地猛吹出短促又刺耳的海螺声。猪崽子则在人群中东走西跑，问名问姓并皱眉皱额地记着这些名字。孩子们服从猪崽子，就像过去无条件服从带话筒的大人。有些孩子光着身子，提着衣服；还有些半裸着身子，或者多少穿点衣服；有穿各种学校制服：灰色、蓝色、浅黄色的；有穿茄克衫或线衫的；有穿着彩条纹袜子和紧身上衣的；还有戴着各种徽章，甚至格言牌的。在绿阴里横卧着的树干之上，人头济济，头发有褐色的、金黄的、黑色的、栗色的、淡茶色的、鼠灰色的；都在那儿窃窃私语，都睁大着眼睛观察着拉尔夫，猜测着某种事情正在进行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The children who came along the beach, singly or in twos, leapt into visibility when they crossed the line from heat haze to nearer sand. Here, the eye was first attracted to a black, bat-like creature that danced on the sand, and only later perceived the body above it. The bat was the child's shadow, shrunk by the vertical sun to a patch between the hurrying feet. Even while he blew, Ralph noticed the last pair of bodies that reached the platform above a fluttering patch of black. The two boys, bullet-headed and with hair like tow, flung themselves down and lay grinning and panting at Ralph like dogs. They were twins, and the eye was shocked and incredulous at such cheery duplication. They breathed together, they grinned together, they were chunky and vital. They raised wet lips at Ralph, for they seemed provided with not quite enough skin, so that their profiles were blurred and their mouths pulled open. Piggy bent his flashing glasses to them and could be heard between the blasts, repeating their names.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿着海滩单独地、或三三两两地走来的孩子，越过暑热烟霭至附近沙滩的交接部分就一跃而变得清晰可见。在这儿，孩子们的眼光先被一个在沙滩上舞动着的、黑黑的、蝙蝠样的东西吸引住了，随后才察觉到这之上的身体。原来蝙蝠样的东西是一个孩子的身影，由于垂直的阳光照射而在杂乱的脚步之中缩成的一块斑影。就是当拉尔夫在吹海螺时，他也注意到了最后两个随飘动的黑斑影到达平台的身体。两个脑袋尖尖、长着短麻屑似的头发的男孩，像狗似的趴倒在拉尔夫面前，躺在那里气喘吁吁地露齿而笑。他们俩是双胞胎，长得非常相像，此刻正微笑着；孩子们见了大吃一惊，简直难以相信自己的眼睛。双胞胎一块儿呼气吸气，一块儿咧嘴而笑，矮小结实，生气勃勃。他们俩朝拉尔夫抬起湿润的嘴唇。似乎是因为身上皮肤不够，所以他们的侧影显得模糊、嘴巴张得挺大。猪崽子朝他们弯下身子，他亮闪闪的眼镜对着他们，在阵阵的海螺声中重复着他们两人的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Within the diamond haze of the beach something dark was fumbling along. Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way. Then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing. The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing. Shorts, shirts, and different garments they carried in their hands; but each boy wore a square black cap with a silver badge on it. Their bodies, from throat to ankle, were hidden by black cloaks which bore a long silver cross on the left breast and each neck was finished off with a hambone frill. The heat of the tropics, the descent, the search for food, and now this sweaty march along the blazing beach had given them the complexions of newly washed plums. The boy who controlled them was dressed in the same way though his cap badge was golden. When his party was about ten yards from the platform he shouted an order and they halted, gasping, sweating, swaying in the fierce light. The boy himself came forward, vaulted on to the platform with his cloak flying, and peered into what to him was almost complete darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在海滩钻石般闪烁的烟霭中某种黑乎乎的东西正在摸索前来。拉尔夫一眼先见，他注视着，他全神贯注的眼光渐渐把所有孩子的眼光都吸引到那个方向。接着那个东西从烟霭中走到了清晰的沙滩上，这下孩子们才看到黑乎乎的并不全是阴影，却大多是衣服。那东西是一队男孩，他们穿着令人陌生的古怪衣服，排成并列的两行，迈着整齐的步子。他们手里拿着短裤、衬衫，提着各种衣服；但每个男孩都头戴一顶带银色帽徽的黑方帽。他们的身体从喉咙到脚跟都裹在黑斗篷里，左胸前还佩着一个长长的、银色的十字架，每个人的颈部都装饰着丑角服装上用的叠花边领。热带的暑热，翻山越岭，寻找食物，此刻再加上沿着光线强烈得令人目眩的海滩这次大汗淋漓的行军，使他们的皮肤红得就像刚洗过的梅子。管他们的一个男孩穿着一样，不过他的帽徽是金色的。这支队伍离平台约十码远时，他一声令下，队伍停住，在赤热的阳光下他们个个气喘吁吁，汗如雨下，东摇西晃。这个男孩独自往前走来，斗篷轻扬，一跃而上平台，此刻他眼前几乎是一片漆黑，但他仍盯着前面看。">查看中文翻译</div>

None of the boys could have found good reason for this; what intelligence had been shown was traceable to Piggy while the most obvious leader was Jack. But there was a stillness about Ralph as he sat that marked him out: there was his size, and attractive appearance; and most obscurely, yet most powerfully, there was the conch. The being that had blown that, had sat waiting for them on the platform with the delicate thing balanced on his knees, was set apart.</div>

As they pushed forward the squeaking increased till it became a frenzy. They found a piglet caught in a curtain of creepers, throwing itself at the elastic traces in all the madness of extreme terror. Its voice was thin, needle-sharp and insistent; The three boys rushed forward and Jack drew his knife again with a flourish. He raised his arm in the air. There came a pause, a hiatus, the pig continued to scream and the creepers to jerk, and the blade continued to flash at the end of a bony arm. The pause was only long enough for them to understand what an enormity the downward stroke would be. Then the piglet tore loose from the creepers and scurried into the undergrowth. They were left looking at each other and the place of terror. Jack's face was white under the freckles. He noticed that he still held the knife aloft and brought his arm down replacing the blade in the sheath. Then they all three laughed ashamedly and began to climb back to the track.</div>
