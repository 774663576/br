<div class="line_en">But it was a perilous thing for Ermengarde and Lottie to make pilgrimages to the attic. They could never be quite sure when Sara would be there, and they could scarcely ever be certain that Miss Amelia would not make a tour of inspection through the bedrooms after the pupils were supposed to be asleep. So their visits were rare ones, and Sara lived a strange and lonely life. It was a lonelier life when she was downstairs than when she was in her attic. She had no one to talk to; and when she was sent out on errands and walked through the streets, a forlorn little figure carrying a basket or a parcel, trying to hold her hat on when the wind was blowing, and feeling the water soak through her shoes when it was raining, she felt as if the crowds hurrying past her made her loneliness greater. When she had been the Princess Sara, driving through the streets in her brougham, or walking, attended by Mariette, the sight of her bright, eager little face and picturesque coats and hats had often caused people to look after her. A happy, beautifully cared for little girl naturally attracts attention. Shabby, poorly dressed children are not rare enough and pretty enough to make people turn around to look at them and smile. No one looked at Sara in these days, and no one seemed to see her as she hurried along the crowded pavements. She had begun to grow very fast, and, as she was dressed only in such clothes as the plainer remnants of her wardrobe would supply, she knew she looked very queer, indeed. All her valuable garments had been disposed of, and such as had been left for her use she was expected to wear so long as she could put them on at all. Sometimes, when she passed a shop window with a mirror in it, she almost laughed outright on catching a glimpse of herself, and sometimes her face went red and she bit her lip and turned away.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the evening, when she passed houses whose windows were lighted up, she used to look into the warm rooms and amuse herself by imagining things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or about the tables. It always interested her to catch glimpses of rooms before the shutters were closed. There were several families in the square in which Miss Minchin lived, with which she had become quite familiar in a way of her own. The one she liked best she called the Large Family. She called it the Large Family not because the members of it were big -- for, indeed, most of them were little -- but because there were so many of them. There were eight children in the Large Family, and a stout, rosy mother, and a stout, rosy father, and a stout, rosy grandmother, and any number of servants. The eight children were always either being taken out to walk or to ride in perambulators by comfortable nurses, or they were going to drive with their mamma, or they were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss him and dance around him and drag off his overcoat and look in the pockets for packages, or they were crowding about the nursery windows and looking out and pushing each other and laughing -- in fact, they were always doing something enjoyable and suited to the tastes of a large family. Sara was quite fond of them, and had given them names out of books -- quite romantic names. She called them the Montmorencys when she did not call them the Large Family. The fat, fair baby with the lace cap was Ethelberta Beauchamp Montmorency; the next baby was Violet Cholmondeley Montmorency; the little boy who could just stagger and who had such round legs was Sydney Cecil Vivian Montmorency; and then came Lilian Evangeline Maud Marion, Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, Veronica Eustacia, and Claude Harold Hector.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚，她经过一些亮着灯光的房屋的窗子时，常常朝暖和的屋子里张望，看见人们坐在壁炉前或桌子旁，她就想象一些有关他们的事情来自娱。在尚未关上百叶窗前，她总有兴致多看上几眼房里的情景。在铭钦女士所住的场院边有几户人家，她以自己的独特方式同他们熟悉起来。她把最喜欢的那一家称之为“大家庭”。这倒并不是因为那一家的成员们个子大一一实际上他们大多数是小孩子——而是因为它人口众多。“大家庭”里有八个儿童，一位身体健壮、脸色红润的母亲，一位身体健壮、脸色红润的父亲和一位身体健壮、脸色红润的祖母，还有许许多多仆人。那八个孩子总是被领出去散步或者坐上由心情舒畅的保姆推着的童车，或者和妈妈一同驾车出去，或者在黄昏时分奔向门口去迎接爸爸，吻他，围着他跳舞，拉下他的大衣，翻他的衣袋找有没有小包的东西，或者挤在育儿室的窗口向外张望，你推我、我推你地哈哈大笑——他们确实经常做些适合大家庭口味的赏心乐事。萨拉很喜欢他们，按照书本上的人名给他们起名字——十分罗曼蒂克的名宇。当她不叫他们“大家庭”时，就称之为蒙莫朗西一家。那个戴花边帽的胖乎乎、娇滴滴的婴儿叫做埃塞伯塔·博尚·蒙莫朗西，那个大一点的叫做维奥莱·楚芒德里·蒙莫朗西，那个长着圆滚滚的腿儿、刚学走路的小男孩叫做悉尼·塞西尔·维维安·蒙莫朗西，后面接着是莉莲·伊万杰琳·莫德·马里恩、罗莎琳德·格拉迪斯、盖伊·克拉伦斯、韦罗尼卡·欧斯塔西奥和克劳德·哈罗德·赫克托。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Christmas time, and the Large Family had been hearing many stories about children who were poor and had no mammas and papas to fill their stockings and take them to the pantomime -- children who were, in fact, cold and thinly clad and hungry. In the stories, kind people -- sometimes little boys and girls with tender hearts -- invariably saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts, or took them home to beautiful dinners. Guy Clarence had been affected to tears that very afternoon by the reading of such a story, and he had burned with a desire to find such a poor child and give her a certain sixpence he possessed, and thus provide for her for life. An entire sixpence, he was sure, would mean affluence for evermore. As he crossed the strip of red carpet laid across the pavement from the door to the carriage, he had this very sixpence in the pocket of his very short man-o-war trousers; And just as Rosalind Gladys got into the vehicle and jumped on the seat in order to feel the cushions spring under her, he saw Sara standing on the wet pavement in her shabby frock and hat, with her old basket on her arm, looking at him hungrily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时正当圣诞节期，“大家庭”的孩子们听说过许多关于穷苦孩子的故事，他们没有爹妈来把节日礼物装在长统袜里并带他们去看节日上演的童话剧，实际上这是些衣衫单薄、饥寒交迫的儿童。在那些故事中，好心人——有时候是一些软心肠的小男孩和小女孩——总是去看望穷孩子，给他们钱或丰富的礼物，把他们带回家参加丰盛的晚宴。盖伊·克拉伦斯那天上午读了这样一个故事后感动得哭了，他焦灼地渴望见到一个这样的孩子，好将自己的六便士硬币给她，使她终身受用。他相信一整个六便士硬币能使她永远富足。当他顺着那条从门口起越过人行道一直铺到马车边的红地毯走时，身上穿的那条很短的水兵式裤子的裤兜里就放着这枚六便士硬币。正当罗莎琳德·格拉迪斯跨进车子，跳上座位，好体验一下坐垫的弹簧时，他看到萨拉站在湿漉漉的人行道上，穿着破衣，戴着破帽，臂上挎着旧篮子，正如饥似渴地望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children's party, and just as Sara was about to pass the door they were crossing the pavement to get into the carriage which was waiting for them. Veronica Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white-lace frocks and lovely sashes, had just got in, and Guy Clarence, aged five, was following them. He was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes, and such a darling little round head covered with curls, that Sara forgot her basket and shabby cloak altogether -- in fact, forgot everything but that she wanted to look at him for a moment. So she paused and looked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒙莫朗西家中有几个孩子显然是要去参加儿童集会，就在萨拉经过大门口时，他们正跨过人行道登上候在那里的马车。韦罗尼卡·欧斯塔西奧和罗莎琳德·格拉迪斯穿着镶白花边的连衣裙，束着可爱的腰带，刚登上马车，五岁的盖伊·克拉伦斯跟着上了车。他是个挺漂亮的小家伙，玫瑰色的脸庞，蓝蓝的眼睛，可爱的小圆脑袋上长满了一头鬈发，这使萨拉全然忘了她的篮子和破旧的外衣——实际上把一切都忘了，只想朝他看一会儿，于是便停下脚步来看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara started, and all at once realized that she looked exactly like poor children she had seen, in her better days, waiting on the pavement to watch her as she got out of her brougham. And she had given them pennies many a time. Her face went red and then it went pale, and for a second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉吓了一跳，但立即明白，自己现在这副样子完全像在当初的好日子里从四轮马车中下来时看到的那些等在人行道上看她的可怜的孩子。她曾多次给他们零钱。这时她脸红了又变白，片刻之间感到好像不能接受这枚珍贵的小小六便士硬币。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had nothing to eat for a long time. He did not know that they looked so because she was hungry for the warm, merry life his home held and his rosy face spoke of, and that she had a hungry wish to snatch him in her arms and kiss him. He only knew that she had big eyes and a thin face and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes. So he put his hand in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her benignly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，她的眼神看上去像是在挨着饿，或许因为她很久没东西可吃了。他不知道那是由于她渴望着他那家庭所享有的和他那玫瑰色脸庞所说明的温暖愉快的生活，而且她还渴望把他揽到怀里亲吻。他只知道她有一双大眼睛和一张瘦削的脸，两腿细细的，穿着破衣服，拿着只普通的篮子。于是他把手伸进口袋，摸到了他的六便士硬币，亲切地向她走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit of narrow ribbon round her neck. Her affection for the Large Family increased -- as, indeed, her affection for everything she could love increased. She grew fonder and fonder of Becky, and she used to look forward to the two mornings a week when she went into the schoolroom to give the little ones their French lesson. Her small pupils loved her, and strove with each other for the privilege of standing close to her and insinuating their small hands into hers. It fed her hungry heart to feel them nestling up to her. She made such friends with the sparrows that when she stood upon the table, put her head and shoulders out of the attic window, and chirped, she heard almost immediately a flutter of wings and answering twitters, and a little flock of dingy town birds appeared and alighted on the slates to talk to her and make much of the crumbs she scattered. With Melchisedec she had become so intimate that he actually brought Mrs. Melchisedec with him sometimes, and now and then one or two of his children. She used to talk to him, and, somehow, he looked quite as if he understood.</div>

<div class="line_en">There had grown in her mind rather a strange feeling about Emily, who always sat and looked on at everything. It arose in one of her moments of great desolateness. She would have liked to believe or pretend to believe that Emily understood and sympathized with her. She did not like to own to herself that her only companion could feel and hear nothing. She used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to her on the old red footstool, and stare and pretend about her until her own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like fear -- particularly at night when everything was so still, when the only sound in the attic was the occasional sudden scurry and squeak of Melchisedec's family in the wall. One of her "pretends" was that Emily was a kind of good witch who could protect her. Sometimes, after she had stared at her until she was wrought up to the highest pitch of fancifulness, she would ask her questions and find herself ALMOST feeling as if she would presently answer.

<div class="line_en">But though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, she did not find it easy. When, after a long, hard day, in which she had been sent here and there, sometimes on long errands through wind and cold and rain, she came in wet and hungry, and was sent out again because nobody chose to remember that she was only a child, and that her slim legs might be tired and her small body might be chilled; when she had been given only harsh words and cold, slighting looks for thanks; when the cook had been vulgar and insolent; when Miss Minchin had been in her worst mood, and when she had seen the girls sneering among themselves at her shabbiness -- then she was not always able to comfort her sore, proud, desolate heart with fancies when Emily merely sat upright in her old chair and stared.</div>

<div class="line_en">"As to answering, though," said Sara, trying to console herself, "I don't answer very often. I never answer when I can help it. When people are insulting you, there is nothing so good for them as not to say a word -- just to look at them and THINK. Miss Minchin turns pale with rage when I do it, Miss Amelia looks frightened, and so do the girls. When you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are, because you are strong enough to hold in your rage, and they are not, and they say stupid things they wish they hadn't said afterward. There's nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in -- that's stronger. It's a good thing not to answer your enemies. I scarcely ever do. Perhaps Emily is more like me than I am like myself. Perhaps she would rather not answer her friends, even. She keeps it all in her heart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，说到回答，”萨拉说，竭力安慰自己，“我也不常回答问题的。只要有办法回避，就不回答。当人们侮辱你时，对付他们的最好办法就是一言不发——光是看着他们，用头脑思索。我这样做时，铭钦女士会气得脸都发白。阿米莉亚小姐和那些女孩子都会露出惊恐的样子。如果你并不勃然大怒，他们就会明白你比他们强，因为你相当坚强，能抑制怒火，而他们却不够坚强，尽说些蠢话，事后才反悔。没有什么比怒火更强烈的了，除了使你抑制住它的那股力量一一它比怒火更强。不去回答你的敌人，这是再好不过的事。我就难得答理他们。也许埃米莉比我自己更像我。也许她宁愿对朋友也：不回答，把一切都藏在心里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Sara bent and picked her up. Remorse overtook her. She even smiled at herself a very little smile.</div>

He ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future.
