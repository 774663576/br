<div class="line_en">"Dumbledore was really angry," Hermione said in a quaking voice. "I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away… He was furious they'd come onto the grounds. We heard him --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“邓布利多真正生气了，”赫敏颤抖着声音说，“我还从来没看见他这么生气过。你摔下来的时候他奔到球场上去了，他挥动魔杖，你撞到地面以前好像就放慢了下落的速度。然后他对摄魂怪舞动魔杖，向它们射出银色的东西。它们直接离开了看台…它们来到球场上，他对这件事气得不得了，我们听到他——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="球队走了，身后留下一道道泥浆。庞弗雷夫人在他们身后关上了门，一脸不高兴的样子。罗恩和赫敏走近哈利床前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him… about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但哈利几乎没有注意到。他在想摄魂怪对他做了什么…想那尖叫的声音。他抬头一看，只见罗恩和赫敏在焦急地看着他，于是他很快地想出别的实在的话来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利心里一阵绞痛。那棵打人柳是棵很暴烈的树，它长在禁林中央。">查看中文翻译</div>
