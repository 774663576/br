<div class="line_en">"No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why should you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of improving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general direct him perfectly right."</div>

I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense. I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of his sense and his goodness," continued Elinor, "no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth. But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对于他的德行与理智，”埃丽诺接着说，“凡是经常见到他，能同他畅所欲言的人，我想谁也无法怀疑。他有卓越的见识和操守，只因生性缅腆，经常寡言少语，一时显现不出来。你了解他，能对他那实实在在的人品做出公正的评价。至于谈到你所谓的细微的倾向，有些特殊情况你没有我了解。我有时常和他在一起，而你却完全让母亲拴住了，亲热起来没完没了。我常常见到他，研究了他的情感，听取了他在文学与鉴赏方面的见解。整个来说，我敢断言，他知识渊博，酷爱读书，想象力丰富，观察问题公允而准确，情趣风雅而纯洁。他各方面的能力和他的人品举止一样，你越是了解，印象越好。初看上去，他的风度的确不很引人注目，相貌也算不上漂亮，不过你一见到他那无比动人的眼神，你就会发现他的整个表情都十分可爱。现在我很了解他，觉得他确实漂亮，至少可以说几乎是漂亮的。你看呢，玛丽安？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next-that with them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一听这话，埃丽诺不禁为之一惊。她后悔自己不该那样热烈地赞扬爱德华。她觉得，她对爱德华尊崇备至。她认为这种尊崇是双方互有的。不过，对这种相互尊崇，她需要有更大的把握，才能让玛丽安确信他们是相互钟情的，她自己也好感到踏实一些。她知道，玛丽安和母亲忽而胡猜乱想，忽而信以为真。对她俩来说，想望着的便是有希望的，有希望的便是指日可待的。她想把事情的真相向妹妹解释清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor could not help laughing. "Excuse me," said she; "and be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion-the hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am by no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel little-scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺忍不住笑了。“请原谅，”她说，“你尽管放心，我这样平心静气地谈论我的感情，决没有冒犯你的意思。请你相信，我的感情比我表白的还要强烈。而且你要相信，由于他有那么多优点，由于我怀疑他——希望他有情于我，我才理所当然地产生了这种感情，这既不轻率，也不唐突。但是除此之外，你切不可信以为真。我不敢保证他一定有心于我。有些时候，这种事情还很难说。在没有彻底摸清他的真实思想以前，我想自己还是不要纵容这种偏爱，不要以想象代替事实，轻信妄言，这你是不会感到奇怪的。讲心里话，我并不——几乎一点也不怀疑他对我特别喜爱。但是，除此之外，还有别的问题需要考虑。他绝非是独立自主的。他母亲究竟是什么样的人，我们不得而知。不过，范妮偶尔谈到过她的行为和见解，我们从不认为她是和悦的。爱德华自己也肯定知道，他假若想娶一个财产不多、身价不高的女人，一定会遇到重重困难。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And you really are not engaged to him!" said she. "Yet it certainly soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你当真没有和他订婚：”她说。“然而，这准是马上就要发生的事情。不过，这样推迟一下倒有两个好处，一则我不会这么快就失去你，二则爱德华可以有更多的机会提高自己的天生的鉴赏力，以便欣赏你的特殊爱好，这对你们未来的幸福是必不可少的。哦！他若为你的天才所激发，也学会画画，那该多么令人高兴啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable to her. He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当她处于这种精神状态的时候，达什伍德太太接到邮递来的一封信，信里有个特别及时的提议，说是有一幢小房要出租，要价很便宜，因为房主是她的一位亲戚。此人是德文郡一位有钱有势的绅士。信就是这位绅士亲自写的，写得情真意切，表现出友好相助的精神。他说，他晓得她需要一处住所，虽然他现在向她提议的这座房子只是座乡舍，但是他向她保证，只要她满意这个地方，他一定根据她的需要，尽力加以改修。他介绍了房屋和花园的具体情况之后，便恳挚地敦促她和女儿们一道，早日光临他的寓所巴顿庄园，以便亲自权衡一下，看看巴顿乡舍（因为这些房子都在同一教区）经过改修是否能使她称心加意。看样子，他确实急于想给她们提供住房，整封信写得那么友好，表妹读了哪能不高兴呢？特别是当她遭受近亲的冷落之后。她不需要时间去细想细问，读着读着便下定了决心。巴顿地处德文郡，远离苏塞克斯。若是在几个小时以前，仅凭这一个不利条件，就足以抵消它可能具备的一切有利条件，但目前它却成了最为可取之处。搬出诺兰一带不再是不幸的事情，而是成为一心想望的目标，与继续寄人篱下，忍受儿媳的窝囊气相比，这简直是一件幸事。诺兰庄园纵然是个可爱的地方，但是有这样一个女人在这里做主妇，能永远离开还是比住在这里更少些痛苦。她当即给约翰。米德尔顿写信，感谢他的好意，并且接受了他的建议。然后，她急忙将两封信拿给女儿们看，以便在发信前先征得她们的同意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm. She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present acquaintance. On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence.</div>
