<div class="line_en">Coraline walked up the steps outside the building to the topmost flat where, in her world, the crazy old man upstairs lived. She had gone up there once with her real mother, when her mother was collecting for charity. They had stood in the open doorway, waiting for the crazy old man with the big moustache to find the envelope that Coraline's mother had left, and the flat had smelled of strange foods and pipe tobacco and odd, sharp, cheesy-smelling things which Coraline could not name. She had not wanted to go any further inside than that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰走在宅子外面的楼梯上，向阁楼套间爬去。在她自己的世界里，那是疯老头儿住的地方。她和自己真正的妈妈上去过一次，陪她去做慈善募捐。当时，她们站在敞开的房门前，闻见房子里一大股奇特的食物味儿、烟草味儿，还有一种卡萝兰说不出名字的气味，很怪，很冲，有点像奶酪。那一次，她说什么也不肯进屋去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When we rise from underneath, whispered a dozen or more tiny voices, in that dark flat with the roof so low where it met the walls that Coraline could almost reach up and touch it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们从下面爬起来的时候，在那间黑暗的公寓里，听声音有十多个，可能还要多。小小的声音，悄声唱着。里面黑乎乎的，屋顶很低，靠墙的地方，卡萝兰差不多可以伸手够到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was nothing here that frightened her. These things -- even the thing in the cellar -- were illusions, things made by the other mother in a ghastly parody of the real people and real things on the other end of the corridor. She couldn't truly make anything, decided Coraline. She could only twist and copy and distort things that already existed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个世界里，没有什么东西能吓倒她。这些东西全是假的，是幻象，就连地窖里那些东西也是。都是另一个妈妈比着通道另一头的真正世界里的人和东西做出来的，而且做得很差劲。卡萝兰明白了，她其实做不出任何真正的东西，只能把本来就有的东西复制一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It smelt much worse in here than in the real crazy old man upstairs's flat.

<div class="line_en">"Come here, little girl. I know what you want, little girl." It was a rustling voice, scratchy and dry. It made Coraline think of some kind of enormous dead insect. Which was silly, she knew. How could a dead thing, especially a dead insect, have a voice?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“上这儿来，小姑娘。我知道你想找什么，小姑娘。”声音粗拉拉的，又干又哑，让卡萝兰想起个头很大的死昆虫。她知道这是犯傻。死东西怎么会说话？更别说死昆虫了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Coraline found herself wondering why the other mother would have placed a snowglobe on the drawing-room mantelpiece; a place that, in her world, was quite bare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，卡萝兰想起一件事：另一个妈妈为什么要在客厅壁炉架上放一个雪花球。在卡萝兰的世界里，壁炉架上光光的，什么都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She walked through several rooms with low, slanting ceilings until she came to the final room. It was a bedroom, and the other crazy old man upstairs sat at the far end of the room, in the near-darkness, bundled up in his coat and hat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她穿过几间屋顶低矮的房间，最后走进最里头那间。这是一间卧室，另一个楼上的疯老头儿坐在房间另一头，裹着大衣，扣着帽子。光线太暗，简直看不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Coraline entered he began to talk. "Nothing's changed, little girl," he said, his voice sounding like the noise dry leaves make as they rustle across a pavement. "And what if you do everything you swore you would? What then? Nothing's changed. You'll go home. You'll be bored. You'll be ignored. No one will listen to you, not really listen to you. You're too clever and too quiet for them to understand. They don't even get your name right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰刚进门，他就说起话来。“什么都不会变，小姑娘。”他说。声音就像干树叶子，沙沙响着飘过人行道，“就算你把所有发誓要做到的事儿都做到了，又怎么样？什么都不会变。你会回家，你会厌烦。人家不会理你。没人听你说什么，就算听也是做做样子。你太聪明，又太不起眼了，他们是不会理解的。他们连你的名字都叫错了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stay here with us," said the voice from the figure at the end of the room. "We will listen to you and play with you and laugh with you. Your other mother will build whole worlds for you to explore, and tear them down every night when you are done. Every day will be better and brighter than the one that went before.

<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰叹了口气，“看样子，你真是不懂，对不对？”她说，“我不愿意想要什么就有什么。没人愿意。嘴上说说可以，心里都是不愿意的。想要什么就有什么，那还有什么乐趣？真要那样的话，什么都没意思了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a glow coming from the raincoat of the man, at about chest height. Through the hole in the stone the glow twinkled and shone blue-white as any star.

<div class="line_en">Coraline took a step closer to the man, and he fell apart. Black rats leapt from the sleeves and from under the coat and hat, a score or more of them, red eyes shining in the dark. They chittered and they fled.

<div class="line_en">Now, rats can run faster than people, especially over short distances. But a large black rat holding a marble in its two front paws is no match for a determined girl (even if she is small for her age) moving at a run. Smaller black rats ran back and forth across her path, trying to distract her, but she ignored them all, keeping her eyes fixed on the one with the marble, who was heading straight out of the flat, towards the front door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错儿，老鼠比人跑得快。距离短的话，人别想赶上老鼠。可如果一只大黑老鼠前爪抱着一颗弹子，它就不是一个下定决心赶上它的小姑娘的对手了。大群个头小些的老鼠在她前头乱窜，想分散她的注意力。卡萝兰不理睬它们，眼睛死死盯着那只抱着弹子的大老鼠。大老鼠想逃出这套房子，朝前门跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They reached the steps on the outside of the building.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们奔到宅子外的楼梯上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline had time to observe that the house itself was continuing to change, becoming less distinct, and flattening out, even as she raced down the stairs. It reminded her of a photograph of a house now, not the thing itself. Then she was simply racing pell-mell down the steps in pursuit of the rat, with no room in her mind for anything else, certain she was gaining on it. She was running fast -- too fast, she discovered, as she came to the bottom of one flight of steps, and her foot skidded and twisted and she went crashing on to the concrete landing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰冲下楼梯，同时注意到，这幢宅子好像在不断变化，变得越来越模糊，越来越扁。就在她冲下楼梯这一小会儿，它就又扁了不少。现在，她觉得它更像一张宅子的照片，不像宅子本身。她来不及多想，她正连滚带爬冲下楼梯追击老鼠，脑子里装不下别的东西。她快追上了，她跑得很快——太快了，快到楼梯脚时，脚滑了一下，一拧，她一头摔在楼梯下面的水泥地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline reached out her hand and pulled the coat open. It was empty, although it was greasy to the touch. There was no sign of the final glass marble in it. She scanned the room, squinting through the hole in the stone, and caught sight of something that twinkled and burned like a star, at floor level, by the doorway. It was being carried in the forepaws of the largest black rat. As she looked, it slipped away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰伸出一只手，掀开大衣。摸上去油腻腻的，里面什么都没有，找不着最后那颗大理石弹子。她眯缝着眼睛，从石头洞眼里扫视这间屋子，发现一个像星星一样亮晶晶的东西，就在靠近门口的地板上。它被一只个头最大的老鼠用两只前爪抱在怀里。她刚刚朝那个方向一看，大老鼠撒腿就跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her left knee was scraped and skinned, and the palm of one hand she had thrown out to stop herself was a mess of scraped skin and grit. It hurt a little, and it would, she knew, soon hurt much more. She picked the grit out of the palm and climbed to her feet and, as fast as she could, knowing that she had lost and it was already too late, she went down the final set of steps to ground level.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hand stung where the skin had been scraped, and there was blood trickling down her ripped pyjama-leg from her knee. It was as bad as the summer that her mother had taken the training wheels off Coraline's bicycle; but then, back then, in with all the cuts and scrapes (her knees had had scabs on top of scabs) she had a feeling of achievement. She was learning something, doing something she had not known how to do before. Now she felt nothing but cold loss. She had failed the ghost-children. She had failed her parents. She had failed herself, failed everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cat's fur was on end, and its tail was bristling like a chimney-sweep's brush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫的毛竖起来，尾巴上面的毛全爹开了，像扫烟囱的人用的大刷子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's wrong?" asked Coraline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”卡萝兰问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Whatever's happening," said Coraline, "thank you for helping with the rat. I suppose I'm almost there, aren't I? So you go off into the mist or wherever you go, and I'll, well, I hope I get to see you at home. If she lets me go home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知出了什么事。”卡萝兰说，“但还是谢谢你。我猜，我差不多算赢了，对不对？嗯，你回雾里去吧，回你来的地方去。我会，嗯，我希望，今后还能在我家里见到你，如果她肯放我回家的话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They've gone," said the cat. "They aren't there any more. The ways in and out of this place. They just went flat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不见了。”猫说，“全都不见了。进出这个地方的路，全都变扁了，缩得没有了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that bad?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很糟吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'll be fine," said Coraline. "Everything's going to be fine. I'll take you home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你会没事的，”卡萝兰说，“一切都会好起来。我带你回家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat lowered its tail, swishing it from side to side angrily. It made a low growling noise in the back of its throat. It walked in a circle, until it was facing away from Coraline, and then it began to walk backwards, stiffly, one step at a time, until it was pushing up against Coraline's leg. She put down a hand to stroke it, and could feel how hard its heart was beating. It was trembling, like a dead leaf in a storm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫放低尾巴，气愤地扫来扫去，喉咙深处发出低低的咆哮。它转了个圈子，脸背对着卡萝兰。接着，它又退回来，步子很僵硬，蹭着卡萝兰的腿。她伸出手抚摸着它，觉得它的心跳得非常厉害。它在打哆嗦，像大风里的树叶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat said nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cat was heavy, but not too heavy to carry. It licked at the palm of her hand, where the blood from the scrape was welling up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫没有反抗，只是不停地打哆嗦。她一只手托着它，让它把前爪搭在她肩膀上。猫挺沉，但也不算太沉，她抱得动。它舔了舔她直冒血珠的手掌心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If the only way out is past her," said Coraline, "then that's the way we're going to go." She went back to the cat, bent down and picked it up. The cat did not resist. It simply trembled. She supported its bottom with one hand and rested its front legs on her shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是咱们只能通过她才能回家，”卡萝兰说，“咱们就要通过她，一定得这么办。”她走到猫身旁，蹲下，抱起它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on, cat," said Coraline. She took a step back towards the steps, but the cat stayed where it was, looking miserable and, oddly, much smaller.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别怕，猫。”卡萝兰说。她朝楼梯上迈了一步，可猫留在后头没动。它的模样瞧上去很可怜，还有，连个子都奇怪地小了一圈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She got to her front door -- now just a small-child's scrawl of a door -- and she pushed her hand against it, half-expecting that her hand would rip through it, revealing nothing behind it but blackness and a scattering of stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走到自己的卧室门边。现在，它像小孩子乱涂乱画出来的一扇门。她伸出手，一推。以为手会直接穿过门，发现门后面是一片黑，什么都没有，只有无数星星，东一颗西一颗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the door swung open, and Coraline went through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，门开了。卡萝兰走进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline walked up the steps one at a time, heading back to her own flat. She was aware of the marbles clicking in her pocket, aware of the stone with the hole in it, aware of the cat pressing itself against her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰一步一步走上楼梯，走向她的卧室。她能感觉到大理石弹子在口袋里碰得叮叮响，感觉到那块带洞眼的石头的重量，感觉到猫紧紧偎着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
