<div class="line_en">Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River. Here upon its western side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass. "Here we will rest tonight," said Aragorn.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I feared as much," said Aragorn. "But maybe they are not on this side of the River. The light of Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw. I have never heard before of Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in these evil days, now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也很担心，”阿拉贡说：“不过，或许他们不在河的这一边，刺针的光芒很弱，或许只是指出阿蒙罗山脉上有魔多的间谍活动着。我从来没听说过有半兽人胆敢入侵阿蒙汉山脉。但是，谁知道在乱世中会发生什么事情呢？连米那斯提力斯都无法守住安都因河的入口，还有什么不会发生的！我们明天必须特别提高警觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars of cloud like the fumes of a great burning. The rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the running water. High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed, mounting one head above another; and above them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. Many birds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things could be seen.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Frodo," said Aragorn at last. "I fear that the burden is laid upon you. You are the Bearer appointed by the Council. Your own way you alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，佛罗多，”阿拉贡最后终于说：“看来这重担落到你肩上了，你是之前会议中所指派的魔戒持有者，你必须选择自己的道路，在这件事上我无法给予你任何的建议。虽然我试着继承他的责任，但我依旧不是甘道夫，我不知道他究竟在这个时刻准备怎么做。多半，他可能还是要观察你的作法，关键可能还是在于你的选择，这就是你的命运。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. "The day has come at last," he said: "the day of choice which we have long delayed. What shall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship? Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the Orcs may already be on this side of the water."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们用完餐之后，阿拉贡召集众人：“这一天终于到了！”他说：“我们之前一直拖延这做出抉择的一天。经历这么多事情、越过这么远距离的远征队，到底要如何继续下去？我们应该和波罗莫向西走，参加刚铎的战争吗？或者是向东走，投入恐惧和魔影之下；或者我们必须分散，照着个人的意志拆散成小队？无论如何，我们都必须赶快决定。我们知道敌人在东岸，但是，我担心半人可能也已经进入了河的这一岸。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching his master with great concern, shook his head and muttered: "Plain as a pikestaff it is, but it's no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.",</div>

<div class="line_en">Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. "Very well, Frodo son of Drogo," he said. "You shall have an hour, and you shall be alone. We will stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call."</div>

<div class="line_en">Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places stairs of stone had been hewn, but now they were cracked and worn, and split by the roots of trees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he came to a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and in the midst was a wide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon the East and was filled now with the early sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the River, far below him, to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开始，佛罗多在森林中漫无目的走着，但最后他发现自己的脚一直领着他往山坡上走。他来到一条小径，那是许多年前道路留下的废墟。在陡峭的地方有残留许多的石阶梯，在经过多年的风吹雨打之后，这些阶梯都因为年久失修而变得破碎不堪，在树根的扩张之下变得分崩离析。他爬了一段时间，最后来到一块草地上。四周长着许多的花楸树，中间是块平坦的大石头。这块小草地面对着东方，充分沐浴在陽光的照耀之下，给人一种生机勃勃的感觉。佛罗多停下脚步，俯瞰着底下的大河，看着和那壮丽孤绝的托尔布兰达山，以及在天空中盘旋的鸟儿。拉洛斯瀑布的声音现在成为有节奏的轰隆声，毫不止息地敲打着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf's words. Time went on, and still he was no nearer to a choice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他坐在那块岩石上，一手支着下巴，朝着东方发呆，自从比尔博离开夏尔之后，一切的事情都流过他的脑海，他回忆着甘道夫所说过的所有忠告。时间慢慢的流逝，但他依旧找不出答案来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，他恍若大梦初醒的警觉起来，有什么东西出现在他背后，有什么不友善的生物就在附近。他跳了起来，猛然回过头；却吃惊的发现原来只是一笑容，看来心情很好的波罗莫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was afraid for you, Frodo," he said, coming forward. "If Aragorn is right and Orcs are near, then none of us should wander alone, and you least of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now and talk for a while, since I have found you? It would comfort me. Where there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together may perhaps find wisdom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我替你担心，佛罗多，”他走向前说：“如果阿拉贡说的没错，半兽人的确就在附近，那么没有任何人应该离群独处。特别是你更应该小心，许多人的命运都和你息息相关，我的心情也跟着沉重起来。既然都找到你了，方不方便和你坐下来谈一谈？这会让我感觉好一点。我们底下那边只要一讲话，就会为了前途而争吵不休，不过，或许两个人可以在彼此身上找到智慧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come to grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not desire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves, strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the -- Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad not to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior do in this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command.

We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo," he said. "You need rest before your venture. if go you must."

<div class="line_en">At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men of Numenor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green and silver sea, rippling in endless lines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始他什么也看不见，他似乎处在一团充满陰影的迷雾中，因为他戴着魔戒。然后，慢慢地，有许多地方的迷雾渐渐散开，让他看见大量的影像。这些影像都很小，让他觉得好像是在阅读桌上的书籍，但却又距离遥远，没有丝毫的声音，只有不停变动的影像，整个世界似乎都缩小了，变得无比沉默，他坐在全观之位上，古时被称作努曼诺尔之眼的山丘上。他看着东边许多无人知晓的土地、无人居住的荒原、未经探勘的森林，他看着北边，大河像是他脚下的缎带，迷雾山脉细小的像是野兽断折的牙齿；往西看去他可以看见洛汗国一望无际的草原，还有如同黑色刺针的欧散克塔，位在艾辛格的正中央；他在南边看见了大河如同波浪一般落下拉洛斯瀑布底下的深坑，水气中飘浮着美丽的彩虹；他还看见了伊瑟安都因，安都因大河壮观的巨大三角洲，海鸟如同太陽下的白色灰尘一般四处飞舞，在它们之下则是湛蓝与碧绿色交错，波涛汹涌的大海。">查看中文翻译</div>

He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain-kings.</div>

All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it seemed. and beautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud and fair upon its mountain-seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the grinning gates of Minas Morgul. and the haunted Mountains, and it looked upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor. Darkness lay there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, and a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dur, Fortress of Sauron.

Of course he's had a bit of schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left home, or he'd be so terrified he'd just fling the Ring in the River and bolt. But he's still too frightened to start. And he isn't worrying about us either: whether we'll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That's another thing that's bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he'll want to go alone. Mark my words! We're going to have trouble when he comes back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins."</div>
