<div class="line_en">"For my sake!" said the young man. "Oh, no, not a bit of it! The count will support me when I say that I always begged him, on the contrary, to break off the engagement, which has now fortunately been broken off. The count claims that he is not the person I should thank, so, like the ancient Romans, I'll raise an altar 'To the Unknown God'."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为了我？”那青年人说，“噢，不，真的！伯爵将为我主持公道，证明我一向在求他解除我的婚约，现在解决了，我很快乐。伯爵假装非他所干，是要我不要感谢他，就算如此吧，——我将象古人那样给一位不知名的神建立一个祭坛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Listen," said Monte Cristo, "so little is this to do with me that I have fallen out both with the father-in-law and with the young man. The only one still to hold me in some affection, when she saw the extent to which I was disinclined to make her renounce her precious liberty, is Mademoiselle Eugénie, who doesn't appear to me to have a marked vocation for the married state."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”基督山说，“我跟这件事没有什么关系，因为那岳父和那青年人对我都不十分投机，只有欧琴妮小姐，——她对婚姻问题似乎毫无兴趣，——她，看到我无意劝她放弃她那宝贵的自由，才对我保持着一点情意。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, in spite of everything I could say. I don't know the young man myself, though they say he is rich and comes from a good family; but that's just hearsay as far as I'm concerned. I repeated all this, time and again, to Monsieur Danglars but he is besotted with his Luccan. I even told him about what seems to me a more serious fact, namely that the young man was kidnapped, carried off by gypsies or mislaid by his tutor, I'm not sure which. What I do know is that his father lost sight of him for ten years, and God only knows what he did during that time. Well, none of that made any difference. I have been asked to write to the major, to request some papers from him: here they are. I'm sending them on, but at the same time, like Pilate, I wash my hands of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的，我说的话都不生效力。我并不知道那青年人。据说他的出身很好，很有钱，但在我看来，这都是传闻罢了。我曾几次三番把这一点告诉邓格拉司先生，直到我自己都听厌了，但他还是迷着他那位卢卡人。我甚至通知他一种我认为非常严重的情况：那个青年人大概曾被他的保姆掉过包，或是被波希米亚人拐去过，或是被他的家庭教师丢失过，究竟属于哪一类，我也不十分知道，但我的确知道他的父亲曾有十年以上不曾见过他的面。他在那十年里面究竟做了些什么，只有上帝知道。嗯，那一切话都没有用。他们委托我写信给少校要求证明文件，证明文件是在这儿了。我把这些文件送出去，但象彼拉多①一样，就此洗手不管了。”【注：①《圣经》传说：古罗马巡抚彼拉多在众祭司长和民间长老的压力下，判耶稣死刑，同时当众洗手，说：“流这义人的血，罪不在我，你们承当罢。”】">查看中文翻译</div>

Could you perhaps be in love with Mademoiselle Danglars without realizing it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pooh! It appears he is a Provençal. Monsieur de Villefort had heard speak of him when he was in Marseille, and Monsieur Danglars recalls seeing him. The result is that the crown prosecutor is taking the matter very much to heart and that the prefect of police is apparently extremely interested in it; and the result of all this interest, for which no one could be more grateful than I am, is that for the past fortnight they have rounded up every bandit they could find in Paris and its suburbs, and sent them here, alleging that they are Monsieur Caderousse's murderers. And the result of that will be that in three months, if it continues, there will not be a thief or an assassin in the whole fine kingdom of France who does not know the plan of my house like the back of his hand. So I've decided to abandon it to them entirely and go as far away as the earth can carry me. Come on, Viscount, I'm taking you with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来是一个乡下人。维尔福先生在马赛的时候曾听说过他，邓格拉司先生也记得曾见过他。因此，检察官阁下对这件事非常上劲，警察总监也极感兴趣。这，我当然非常感激，但由于那种关切，他们却把巴黎和巴黎附近所有的窃贼都押到我这儿来，要辨认其中有无杀害卡德罗斯的凶手。假如这样继续下去，则不出三个月，法国的每一个窃贼和刺客都会把我家里的情形弄得了如指掌了。我已决定离开他们，逃避到世界某一个遥远的角落，我很高兴您能陪我一同去，子爵。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He had left, his usual self; and now he returned, his voice strangled, his face blotched with feverish flushes, his eyes glistening beneath blue-veined lids and his walk unsteady like that of a drunken man. "Count," he said, "thank you for your excellent hospitality, which I should like to have enjoyed longer, but I have to go back to Paris."</div>
