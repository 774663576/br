<div class="line_en">Ella's mind was reeling. As they had finished the most perfect dance, she was unable to miss the way the crowd had bowed low as they had passed. It had seemed odd to her, until she realized that as they bowed, they also said, "Your Highness." She had looked at Kit in bewilderment. It was then that he had leaned down and asked her to join him in the gallery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉不禁觉得头脑发晕。他们共同完成那曲完美之舞，她不可能注意不到他们走过时，周围的人毕恭毕敬地鞠躬致意。她非常纳闷，直到听见有人边鞠躬边叫“殿下”，她才恍然大悟。她不解地看着基特。这时基特俯身请她一起去画廊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now Ella was trying to make sense of it all. She had thought she was dancing with just a boy… an apprentice of some sort. But this was obviously no regular boy. Had he been playing her for a fool all along? He had seemed real and honest. Now she didn't know. The promise she had made to her mother echoed through her head. Have courage. She took a deep breath. She would find out the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉想把这一切考虑清楚。她本以为自己只是在和一位男孩跳舞…一个学徒之类的。但是很显然，这不是个普通的小伙子。那他是不是一直在愚弄她？但他看起来又是那么真诚。现在她什么也不知道了。这时她脑海里响起对母亲许下的诺言：坚强而勇敢。她深吸了一口气，想要把事情搞清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, not the prince exactly. There are plenty of princes in the world. I'm only a prince," Kit said, trying to lighten the moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，我不是唯一的王子。世界上有很多王子，我只是其中的一位。”基特想轻松一下气氛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, unaware that anyone was looking for them, Kit and Ella walked down the long castle gallery. The walls were lined with portraits of previous rulers and their families, their faces looking down upon the pair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，基特和瑞拉漫步在城堡那长长的画廊里，根本不知道人们在到处找他们。墙上挂着历代国王和王室成员的画像，他们的脸都看着基特和瑞拉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ella looked down, thinking it through. This was Kit, even if he was really a prince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉低着头，思考着整件事情。他还是基特，虽然他是一位王子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see," she replied. "But you are no apprentice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白了，”她回答道，“但你绝不是什么学徒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So," Kit said, holding out his hand, "no more surprises?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以，”基特说着伸出了手，“没有什么意外了吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am," Kit said quickly. "An apprentice monarch. Still learning the trade." When Ella didn't say anything, Kit scrambled to find the words. "Please forgive me. I thought you might treat me differently if you knew. I mistook you for a simple country girl. But now I see that you didn't want to overawe a plain soldier."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是，”基特立刻说道，“一个国王学徒。还在继续学习这个行当。”瑞拉不再说话，基特费力地想着怎么说才合适。“请原谅我。我怕你知道了我的身份会对我另眼相看。我把你当成了一个普通的乡下姑娘。但是现在我知道了，你当时是不想吓坏我这个普通士兵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A relieved smile spread across Kit's face, and Ella found herself once again captivated by his handsome features. Nervously, Ella looked away, her gaze landing on the portrait in front of them. It was a sizable painting of Kit riding a majestic horse. He was larger than life, his hand holding a sword high in the air, his eyes trained on something in the distance. She was surprised she hadn't noticed before: he was every bit a prince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特的脸上露出了宽慰的微笑，瑞拉再次被他英俊的脸庞迷住了。瑞拉紧张地看着别处，目光落在他们面前的一幅画像上。这是一幅巨大的画像，画像里基特骑着一匹威风凛凛的骏马。画像比真人还大，他手里举着一把剑，眼睛注视着远方。她很吃惊自己先前竟然没注意到，基特怎么看都是一位王子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella paused and then took his hand. "No more surprises," she repeated.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉感到脸红了。她又抬头看着墙壁说道：“你在干什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit nodded. "I hate myself in paintings," he said sheepishly. "Don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特点点头。“我不喜欢画像里的自己，”他不好意思地说，“你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The full moon bathed everything in a silver glow. A large ornamental fountain stood in the middle of the grounds. Water sprayed out of the mouths of ceramic fish, and several Greek gods stood captured forever in stone. Cupid and his bow seemed to be aimed right at Ella and Kit as they walked past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一轮满月给一切都披上了银色的光辉。花园中间有一个很大的装饰喷泉。水花从一条条陶瓷的鱼嘴里喷出，还立着几尊石刻的希腊神像立在喷泉里。丘比特和他的箭似乎正对着缓缓走过的基特和瑞拉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="基特扬起眉毛：“多数人会说，‘多么令人振奋！’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't be," the prince said. "You're right. It is terrible. I'm not supposed to say that… but it is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，”王子说道，“你说得对。是很可怕。我不应该这么说…但确实是。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Ella could ask him more questions, Kit took her hand in his. As she looked down at their interlaced fingers, all other thoughts left her mind. She followed as Kit led her out of the gallery and into the gardens behind the palace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不等瑞拉问其他问题，基特握住瑞拉的手。她低头看着他们相互交叉的手指，心里什么都不去想了。基特拉着她走出画廊，走进了王宫后的花园。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Captain of the Guard, kind fellow that he was," Kit replied. "Who did you have to play with?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“侍卫长，他是个友善的小伙伴，”基特回答，“你和谁一起玩呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"With whom did you play?" Ella asked, imagining a young Kit, his dark waves disheveled and his knees covered with grass stains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你和谁一起玩耍？”瑞拉问道。她想象着小基特的样子，他那乱蓬蓬的深色卷发和他那在草地上弄脏的膝盖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit smiled. "Here is where I played when I was little," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特笑着说：“这是我小时候玩耍的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit smiled. This girl continued to amaze him. She was so wise, yet so innocent. So sweet, yet he could tell she was strong. He felt as though he'd only scratched the surface, and he longed to find out more about her. Kit had to admit the ball had turned out to be quite the good idea after all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特笑了。这个女孩还是让他很惊叹。她那么睿智，又那么天真。她那么善良，但他又看得出她那么坚强。他觉得自己对她只是一知半解，他渴望了解更多关于她的事情。基特不得不承认，举行舞会确实是一个好主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I had so many playmates!" Ella answered, a big smile spreading across her face. "Sheep and geese, and all the mice, of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，我的伙伴可多了！”瑞拉回答道，她的脸上露出了灿烂的笑容。“绵羊，鹅，当然还有所有的老鼠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit looked at Ella, trying to see if she was teasing him. Then she added, "They are excellent listeners."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特看着瑞拉，看她是不是在开玩笑。她接着说：“它们非常善于倾听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sad smile tugged at the corner of Kit's mouth. "My mother loved it here," he said softly. "Since she died, my father can't bring himself to visit the gardens."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特的嘴角露出一丝悲伤的笑容。“我母亲很喜欢这里，”他轻声说，“她去世以后，父亲再也不愿意来这个花园了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They continued to walk around the grounds, past rosebushes. Passing a particularly lovely ornamental urn, Ella clapped her hands. "How beautiful!" she exclaimed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走过庭院，走过蔷薇丛。经过一个特别可爱的花钵时，瑞拉拍着手赞叹道：“多美啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对你来说可不高贵。”基特说，“你有庞大的军队吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella looked up at him. He had planned all this for her? It was overwhelming. "And I came," she finally said, "to see Mr. Kit."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你有权选择自己的爱啊，”瑞拉说，她对这种说法感到震惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"When I go back, they will try to pair me off with a lady of their choosing," Kit replied, his honesty surprising Ella. "I am expected to marry for advantage."</div>

<div class="line_en">Kit shook his head. "I must weigh that against the king's wishes. He is a wise ruler, and a loving father."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特摇了摇头：“可是我要权衡国王的意愿。他是一位英明的国君，一位慈爱的父亲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella felt a pang of sympathy. She reached out a hand and gently touched his arm. Poor Kit. He was a good person, a sweet and thoughtful man who listened to what people had to say. He did not deserve so much pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉感到非常同情。她伸出手轻轻拍了拍基特的胳膊。可怜的基特。他是个善良、体贴的好人，总是愿意倾听别人的意见。他不该承受这么多痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Would you like to see my very favorite place?" Kit's question caught Ella off guard. She had been so lost in thoughts of what the future held she'd forgotten to enjoy the moment while she could. She nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你要看看我最喜欢的地方吗？”基特的问题把瑞拉从对未来的沉思中惊醒。她差点儿忘了享受眼下的美好时刻。她点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉小心翼翼地坐在秋千上，身下的秋千发出了“吱嘎”声。基特走到瑞拉背后，犹豫地把手放到瑞拉的腰间。“可以吗？”他轻柔地在她耳边问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella's heart fluttered and she felt goose bumps rise on her arms. "Please," she said breathlessly.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“一个秘密花园！”瑞拉高兴地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've never shown this to anyone," Kit said, pulling aside a few branches to reveal an old wooden swing. He offered the seat to Ella.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从没带别人来过这儿，”基特说着拨开树枝，前面是一个旧的木秋千。他让瑞拉坐到秋千上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ever so gently, Kit pushed Ella forward. She tucked her knees under the seat, sending the swing back to him. As the swing squeaked, Ella laughed. She hadn't been on a swing in years, and she felt foolish and alive. It reminded her of riding Galahad in the forest, the cool wind rushing past her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特轻轻地推动瑞拉。她把腿蜷在秋千下面，又荡回基特身边。秋千吱吱地响着，瑞拉开怀大笑起来。她很多年没坐过秋千了，感觉到既可笑，又充满活力。这让她想起了骑着加拉哈德在树林里飞奔时习习凉风吹过身体的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
