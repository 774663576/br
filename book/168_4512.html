<div class="line_en">"They are humble. Excessively so, in truth." Tyrion had waited until Varys was summoned by his father before slipping in to pay him a visit. The eunuch's apartments were sparse and small, three snug windowless chambers under the north wall. "I'd hoped to discover bushel baskets of juicy secrets to while away the waiting, but there's not a paper to be found." He'd searched for hidden passages too, knowing the Spider must have ways of coming and going unseen, but those had proved equally elusive. "There was water in your flagon, gods have mercy," he went on, /iyour sleeping cell is no wider than a coffin, and that bed… is it actually made of stone, or does it only feel that way?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, it would have been more in keeping with tradition." The eunuch tittered. "Thankfully, wiser heads prevailed, and the Conclave accepted the fact of Pycelle's dismissal and set about choosing his successor. After giving due consideration to Maester Turquin the cordwainer's son and Maester Erreck the hedge knight's bastard, and thereby demonstrating to their own satisfaction that ability counts for more than birth in their order, the Conclave was on the verge of sending us Maester Gormon, a Tyrell of Highgarden. When I told your lord father, he acted at once."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎哟，别那么狠心，人家博士们也只是秉承传统嘛。”太监窃笑。“其实，枢机会挺机灵的，早就接受了派席尔下台的既成事实，并着手选择继任者。起初，他们详细考量皮匠之子特奎因学士和流浪骑士的私生子艾瑞克学士，好表明能力优先于出生，最后呢，定下的人选却是葛蒙学士，高庭提利尔家族的成员。我把消息报告您父亲大人，他立即采取了行动。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cersei had stripped Ser Boros of his white cloak for failing to die in the defense of Prince Tornmen when Bronn had seized the boy on the Rosby road. The man was no friend of Tyrion's, but after that he likely hated Cersei almost as much. I suppose that's something. "Blount is a blustering coward," he said amiably.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Conclave met in Oldtown behind closed doors, Tyrion knew; its deliberations were supposedly a secret. So Varys has little birds in the Citadel too. "I see. So my father decided to nip the rose before it bloomed." He had to chuckle. "Pycelle is a toad. But better a Lannister toad than a Tyrell toad, no?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="枢机会于旧镇的学城里召开，提利昂心想，会谈的内容都是秘密，毫无疑问，瓦里斯在哪儿也有小小鸟。“我明白了，父亲决定在玫瑰绽放前将其摘下。”他忍不住低声轻笑。“派席尔是个讨厌的蛤蟆，但兰尼斯特的蛤蟆总好过提利尔的蛤蟆，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bronn had turned up all he could on Ser Mandon, but no doubt Varys knew a deal more… should he choose to share it. "The man seems to have been quite friendless," Tyrion said carefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波隆已尽其所能地调查过曼登爵士，但毫无疑问，瓦里斯知道的更多…假如他愿意分享的话。“那人似乎少有亲朋，”提利昂谨慎地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sadly," said Varys, "oh, sadly. You might find some kin if you turned over enough stones back in the Vale, but here… Lord Arryn brought him to King's Landing and Robert gave him his white cloak, but neither loved him much, I fear. Nor was he the sort the smallfolk cheer in tourneys, despite his undoubted prowess. Why, even his brothers of the Kingsguard never warmed to him. Ser Barristan was once heard to say that the man had no friend but his sword and no life but duty… but you know, I do not think Selmy meant it altogether as praise. Which is queer when you consider it, is it not? Those are the very qualities we seek in our Kingsguard, it could be said -- men who live not for themselves, but for their king. By those lights, our brave Ser Mandon was the perfect white knight. And he died as a knight of the Kingsguard ought, with sword in hand, defending one of the king's own blood." The eunuch gave him a slimy smile and watched him sharply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可惜啊，”瓦里斯说，“噢，真可惜，若您肯将搜查范围扩大到艾林谷，或许就能发现他的亲戚了。但在君临嘛…艾林公爵将他带来，劳勃赐予他白袍，仅此而已，俩人都没给他多余的关怀。而他尽管实力超群，却不是那种老百姓愿意在比武会上为之欢呼喝彩的人，更奇怪的是，他和自个儿的铁卫弟兄们也没往来。有人曾听巴利斯坦爵士言道，曼登爵士没有朋友，惟有宝剑，没有生活，惟有职责…您看，我觉得赛尔弥这话不完全是称赞。只需仔细想一想，就会觉得其中的古怪，不是吗？他完全是理想中的御林铁卫，没有任何家室牵累，活着的唯一目的就是守护国王。而今他死得也符合御林铁卫的标准，手中擎剑，为了守护王族而英勇献身。”太监腻腻一笑，目光锐利地盯着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Trying to murder one of the king's own blood, you mean. Tyrion wondered if Varys knew rather more than he was saying. Nothing he'd just heard was new to him; Brorm had brought back much the same reports. He needed a link to Cersei, some sign that Ser Mandon had been his sister's catspaw. What we want is not always what we get, he reflected bitterly, which reminded him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你的意思是，企图谋害王族而死于非命？提利昂怀疑瓦里斯知道的比说出来的多。刚才所言与波隆的报告大致相同，对他来说都不是新闻。他需要的是一个连接瑟曦的环节，以证明曼登爵士是她的爪牙。没有人能够随心所欲，他苦涩地反思，得到自己想要的东西…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How could you? Tyrion had seen her only yesterday, climbing the serpentine steps with a pail of water. He had watched as a young knight had offered to carry the heavy pail. The way she had touched his arm and smiled for him had tied Tyrion's guts into knots. They passed within inches of each other, him descending and her climbing, so close that he could smell the clean fresh scent of her hair. "M'Iord," she'd said to him, with a little curtsy, and he wanted to reach out and grab her and kiss her right there, but all he could do was nod stiffly and waddle on past. "I have seen her several times," he told Varys, "but I dare not speak to her. I suspect that all my movements are being watched."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你怎么可能理解？提利昂昨天刚见过雪伊，当时她正提着水桶攀爬螺旋梯。一个年轻骑士前来帮忙，她触碰他的手臂，还朝他微笑，提利昂见了肠子打结。他和她擦肩而过，仅隔几寸之遥，他往下走，她向上攀，鼻孔里是她头发的清香。“大人，”她一边说，一边屈膝行礼，他心里好想伸手抓她，当场亲吻，但现实中却只能僵硬地点头，蹒跚着走开。“我见过她几次，”他告诉瓦里斯，“但不敢说话。我怀疑自己所有的行动均受到监视。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Come the afternoon, he put the book aside and called for a bath. He scrubbed himself until the water grew cool, and then had Pod even out his whiskers. His beard was a trial to him; a tangle of yellow, white, and black hairs, patchy and coarse, it was seldom less than unsightly, but it did serve to conceal some of his face, and that was all to the good.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he was as clean and pink and trimmed as he was like to get, Tyrion looked over his wardrobe, and chose a pair of tight satin breeches in Lannister crimson and his best doublet, the heavy black velvet with the lion's head studs. He would have donned his chain of golden hands as well, if his father hadn't stolen it while he lay dying. It was not until he was dressed that he realized the depths of his folly. Seven hells, dwarf, did you lose all your sense along with your nose? Anyone who sees you is going to wonder why you've put on your court clothes to visit the eunuch. Cursing, Tyrion stripped and dressed again, in simpler garb; black woolen breeches, an old white tunic, and a faded brown leather jerkin. It doesn't matter, he told himself as he waited for moonrise. Whatever you wear, you're still a dwarf. You'll never be as tall as that knight on the steps, him with his long straight legs and hard stomach and wide manly shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion turned to look. It was true. The eunuch had vanished, skirts and all. The hidden doors are here somewhere, they have to be. That was as much as he had time to think, before Shae turned his head to kiss him. Her mouth was wet and hungry, and she did not even seem to see his scar, or the raw scab where his nose had been. Her skin was warm silk beneath his fingers. When his thumb brushed against her left nipple, it hardened at once. "Hurry," she urged, between kisses, as his fingers went to his laces, "oh, hurry, hurry, I want you in me, in me, in me." He did not even have time to undress properly. Shae pulled his cock out of his breeches, then pushed him down onto the floor and climbed atop him. She screamed as he pushed past her lips, and rode him wildly, moaning, "My giant, my giant, my giant," every time she slammed down on him. Tyrion was so eager that he exploded on the fifth stroke, but Shae did not seem to mind. She smiled wickedly when she felt him spurting, and leaned forward to kiss the sweat from his brow. "My giant of Lannister," she murmured. "Stay inside me, please. I like to feel you there."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Varys should return shortly. He's probably listening to every word we say." Tyrion set the candle down. There was a wet spot on the front of his breeches but in the darkness it ought to go unnoticed. He told Shae to dress and wait for the eunuch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也罢，瓦里斯该回来了，或许他正在下面听我们说话呢，”提利昂放下蜡烛，马裤前面有个湿点，但黑夜里应该没人注意。他要雪伊穿上衣服等太监。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“——您的妓女。”她将一根手指按到他唇上。“我明白，我明白自己的身份。我梦想成为您的情人，但那是不可能的事，否则您会带我去参加宴会。这些都没关系，做您的妓女我已经很满意，提利昂大人，我的狮子，请留下我，保护我吧。”全世界的甜蜜天真都写在她年轻的脸庞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The walk back seemed long and lonely. Podrick Payne was asleep in his trundle bed at the foot of Tyrion's, but he woke the boy. "Bronn," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why no, I woke you up so we could have a little chat about the way he dresses," said Tyrion, but his sarcasm was wasted. Pod only gaped at him in confusion until he threw up his hands and said, "Yes, get him. Bring him. Now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，不，我想和你谈谈他的着装打扮，”提利昂说，看见波德张大嘴巴的疑惑表情，挖苦算是白费了。他只好详细说明，“是的，把他找来。带他过来。快去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion had to bite back his annoyance. Bronn had as much right to bed Alayaya as any other man, but still… I never touched her, much as I wanted to, but Bronn could not know that. He should have kept his cock out of her. He dare not visit Chataya's himself. If he did, Cersei would see that his father heard of it, and 'Yaya would suffer more than a whipping. He'd sent the girl a necklace of silver and jade and a pair of matching bracelets by way of apology, but other than that…</div>
