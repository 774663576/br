<div class="line_en">I get a glimpse of my assailant's face. Hard, with deep lines, a cruel mouth. Gray hair shaved almost to nonexistence, eyes so black they seem all pupils, a long, straight nose reddened by the freezing air. The powerful arm lifts again, his sights set on me. My hand flies to my shoulder, hungry for an arrow, but, of course, my weapons are stashed in the woods. I grit my teeth in anticipation of the next lash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看到了打人者的脸，他表情凶残，满脸横肉，头发剃得短到了发根，眼睛黑黑的，几乎都被黑色的瞳孔占据了，长而直的鼻子冻得通红。他看着我，再次举起了粗壮的胳膊。我不自觉地把手举到肩头，多么渴望这时手里有弓箭，可我的弓箭藏在树洞里。我咬紧牙关，等着鞭子再一次落下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pain is blinding and instantaneous. Jagged flashes of light cross my vision and I fall to my knees. One hand cups my cheek while the other keeps me from tipping over. I can already feel the welt rising up, the swelling closing my eye. The stones beneath me are wet with Gale's blood, the air heavy with its scent. "Stop it! You'll kill him!" I shriek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵撕心裂肺的疼痛掠过我的身体，我立刻眼冒金星，跪倒在地。我用一只手捂住脸，另一只手支住地面。我感到被打的地方立刻肿起来，连眼睛也睁不开。我身下的石头已经沾满了盖尔的鲜血，空气里飘散着浓浓的血腥味。“不要打了！你会打死他的！”我声嘶力竭地尖叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No!" I cry, and spring forward. It's too late to stop the arm from descending, and I instinctively know I won't have the power to block it. Instead I throw myself directly between the whip and Gale. I've flung out my arms to protect as much of his broken body as possible, so there's nothing to deflect the lash. I take the full force of it across the left side of my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不！”我大叫着，冲向前去。拽住他落下的手臂已经来不及了，而且我也没那么大力量。我扑在盖尔身上，同时张开手臂尽全力遮挡着他皮开肉绽的身躯。鞭子重重地抽打在我的左颊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hold it!" a voice barks. Haymitch appears and trips over a Peacekeeper lying on the ground. It's Darius. A huge purple lump pushes through the red hair on his forehead. He's knocked out but still breathing. What happened? Did he try to come to Gale's aid before I got here?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“住手！”一个声音喊道。黑密斯出现了，但却被躺在地上的一个治安警绊了一跤。那是大流士，他的前额上起了一个紫色的大包，已经晕过去了，但还有气儿。究竟发生了什么？在我到来之前他想帮助盖尔吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haymitch ignores him and pulls me to my feet roughly. "Oh, excellent." His hand locks under my chin, lifting it. "She's got a photo shoot next week modeling wedding dresses. What am I supposed to tell her stylist?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I see a flicker of recognition in the eyes of the man with the whip. Bundled against the cold, my face free of makeup, my braid tucked carelessly under my coat, it wouldn't be easy to identify me as the victor of the last Hunger Games. Especially with half my face swelling up. But Haymitch has been showing up on television for years, and he'd be difficult to forget.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe we're it. The only three people in the district who could make a stand like this. Although it's sure to be temporary. There will be repercussions.

You can tell by their expressions that they're not enjoying the show.</div>

<div class="line_en">One, a woman named Purnia who eats regularly at Greasy Sae's, steps forward stiffly. "I believe, for a first offense, the required number of lashes has been dispensed, sir. Unless your sentence is death, which we would carry out by firing squad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个叫珀尼亚的女人，也经常在格雷西·塞的摊上喝汤，她直挺着身子，上前一步，说：“先生，我觉得按他的第一个罪名，他挨的鞭子已经够了，除非判了他死刑，那也该由火枪队执行。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And if he comes to, remind him that the next time he poaches off the Capitol's land, I'll assemble that firing squad personally."

<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，那么，姑娘，赶快把你的表兄弄走。等他醒过来，告诉他，再敢在林子里偷猎，我会亲自召集火枪队的人。”治安警长说着，用手在鞭子上捋了一下，血溅了我们一身，然后他把鞭子盘起来，踱着方步走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," Purnia says, and several others nod in agreement. I'm sure none of them actually know because, in the Hob, the standard protocol for someone showing up with a wild turkey is for everybody to bid on the drumsticks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，先生，”珀尼亚答道，另外有几个人也点头，表示同意。我敢肯定他们没一个人知道，在霍伯黑市，大家见到野火鸡，通常的规矩就是抢着为火鸡腿砍价。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在场的治安警有一大半列成方队，尴尬地跟在他后面，另外几个七手八脚地抬着大流士的胳膊和腿把他带走。我与珀尼亚的眼神相遇，在她走之前，我用嘴唇无声地说“谢谢”，她没有反应，但我清楚她明白我的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As we walk I hear Bristel and Thom, Gale's crewmates, piece together the story of what happened. Gale must've gone to Cray's house, as he's done a hundred times, knowing Cray always pays well for a wild turkey. Instead he found the new Head Peacekeeper, a man they heard someone call Romulus Thread. No one knows what happened to Cray. He was buying white liquor in the Hob just this morning, apparently still in command of the district, but now he's nowhere to be found. Thread put Gale under immediate arrest and, of course, since he was standing there holding a dead turkey, there was little Gale could say in his own defense. Word of his predicament spread quickly. He was brought to the square, forced to plead guilty to his crime, and sentenced to a whipping to be carried out immediately. By the time I showed up, he'd been lashed at least forty times. He passed out around thirty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们向前走着，盖尔的矿友布里斯托和索姆断断续续地讲着事情的经过。像以前一样，盖尔肯定去找克雷了，因为他知道克雷总会为火鸡付个好价钱。可是他却碰到了新来的警长，一个据说叫罗穆卢斯·斯瑞德的人。大家都不清楚克雷究竟是怎么回事，他今早还在霍伯黑市买酒喝，显然还统管着辖区的治安警，可现在哪里也找不到他。斯瑞德立即逮捕了盖尔，盖尔当时手里就拿着火鸡，所以也没法为自己辩护。他的事在区里很快传开了，他被带到广场，被迫承认了他的罪行，被判鞭笞。他们说我出现的时候，他都被打了至少四十鞭了。打到三十鞭时，他就昏了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get some snow on that," Haymitch orders over his shoulder. I scoop up a handful of snow and press it against my cheek, numbing a bit of the pain. My left eye's tearing heavily now, and in the dimming light it's all I can do to follow the boots in front of me.</div>

In moments, the long kitchen table has been cleared, a sterile white cloth spread across it, and Gale hoisted onto it. My mother pours water from a kettle into a basin while ordering Prim to pull a series of her remedies from the medicine cabinet. Dried herbs and tinctures and store-bought bottles.

<div class="line_en">Even in her expert hands, it takes a long time to clean the wounds, arrange what shredded skin can be saved, apply a salve and a light bandage. As the blood clears, I can see where every stroke of the lash landed and feel it resonate in the single cut on my face. I multiply my own pain once, twice, forty times and can only hope that Gale remains unconscious. Of course, that's too much to ask for. As the final bandages are being placed, a moan escapes his lips. Hazelle strokes his hair and whispers something while my mother and Prim go through their meager store of painkillers, the kind usually accessible only to doctors. They are hard to come by, expensive, and always in demand. My mother has to save the strongest for the worst pain, but what is the worst pain? To me, it's always the pain that is present. If I were in charge, those painkillers would be gone in a day because I have so little ability to watch suffering. My mother tries to save them for those who are actually in the process of dying, to ease them out of the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然妈妈清理伤口驾轻就熟，但也用了很长时间，她把破损的皮肤慢慢处理好，涂上药膏，轻轻打上绷带。当盖尔皮肤上的淤血被清理干净之后，我可以清楚地看到每一次鞭子落下的痕迹，我仿佛感到他正经受着和脸上的伤疤同样的彻骨疼痛，我试着想象自己的伤口在受到两次、三次直至四十次鞭打之后，会是什么感觉，我真希望盖尔不要醒来。当然，这是非分之想。最后打绷带时，他嘴里发出了轻轻的呻吟，黑兹尔轻轻抚摸着他的头发，在他的耳边轻语着。妈妈和波丽姆正在给他上所剩不多的止疼药，通常只有医生才能开到这种止疼药，这种药很贵，也很难得到，总是供不应求。妈妈要把最强力的止疼药留到他最疼的时候。可何时才是最疼的时候？对我来说，现在就一直是最疼的时候。要是我是医生，我一天就会把药用完，因为我最看不了别人受疼。以前妈妈总是尽量把药留给那些快死的人，好减轻他们离世前的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
