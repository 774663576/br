<div class="line_en">Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore's weight still upon him, Harry con- centrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore's arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到布满繁星的夜空下，哈利把邓布利多拖到离他们最近的那块巨型卵石顶上，扶他站了起来。邓布利多浑身透湿，瑟瑟发抖，全身的重量仍然压在哈利身上。哈利全身贯注，所有的意念都集中于他的目的地：霍格莫德村。他闭上眼睛，紧紧抓着邓布利多的胳膊，一下子跨进了那种恐怖的挤压感中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: the smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harry's imagination showed him more Inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没等睁开眼睛，他就知道成功了：海风和海腥味都消失了。他和邓布利多站在霍格莫德村漆黑的马路上，浑身发抖，衣服往下滴着水。恍惚间，哈利似乎看见又有阴尸从一些商店旁边钻出来，朝他一步步紧逼过来，可是他眨眨眼睛，却发现什么动静也没有。四下里一片寂静，夜黑得很深，只看见了几盏路灯和楼上几扇亮灯的窗户。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off-balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.</div>

<div class="line_en">A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry's side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly, at waist height.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一秒钟后，他们就听见砰的一声巨响，酒吧的前门被撞开了。两把扫帚嗖地蹿到街上，你追我赶地冲到了哈利身边，然后突然停在腰那么高的位置上，微微地颤动着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry," said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. "It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong… Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“罗斯默塔，请给魔法部送一个情报。”邓布利多说着骑上了离他最近的那把扫帚，“也许霍格沃茨内部的人还不知道已经出事了……哈利，穿上你的隐形衣。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom; Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped towards the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: he was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air. And Harry, too, looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利从口袋里掏出隐形衣披在身上，然后骑上了他的扫帚。当哈利和邓布利多一蹬地面，飞向空中时，罗斯默塔夫人已经跌跌撞撞地朝她的酒吧跑去了。两把扫帚迅疾地朝城堡飞去，哈利侧眼看了看邓布利多，想在他万一摔落时拉他一把，没想到，黑魔标记的出现似乎给邓布利多注入了一针强心剂：他俯身伏在扫帚上，眼睛紧紧地盯着黑魔标记，银白色的长头发和胡须在他身后的夜空中飘荡。哈利便也朝那个骷髅望去，恐惧像一个有毒的气泡一样膨胀着，挤压着他的肺部，他已根本没有心思考虑其他不适……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione and Ginny's luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the DA?

<div class="line_en">As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle, so that they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们飞过先前走过的那些漆黑的、蜿蜒曲折的小巷，晚风在哈利耳边呼啸掠过，在这声音之外，他听见邓布利多又在用某种奇怪的语言低声说着什么。他们飞过围墙、进入场地时，他的扫帚颤抖了一会儿，哈利知道这其中的原因：邓布利多正在解开他亲手设置在城堡周围的那些魔法，这样他们才能迅速进入学校。黑魔标记是在城堡的制高点——天文塔的上空闪烁着。难道这意味着死亡就发生在那里？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman gave an angry little titter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那女人恼怒地假笑了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good evening, Amycus," said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. "And you've brought Alecto too… charming…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“晚上好，阿米库斯，”邓布利多语气十分平静，像是在欢迎那人参加茶会，“你还带来了阿莱克斯……太可爱了……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dumbledore cornered!" he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. "Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“邓布利多被逼到墙角了！”他说完便转向壮实的小个子女人，她看上去像是他的妹妹，脸上也带着迫不及待的笑容，“邓布利多没有魔杖，邓布利多孤立无援！干得漂亮，德拉科，干得漂亮！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个身材粗壮、脸上带着古怪狞笑的歪嘴男人发出了呼哧带喘的笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jokes? No, no, these are manners," replied Dumbledore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“玩笑？不，不，这是礼貌。”邓布利多回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that you, Fenrir?" asked Dumbledore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是你吗，芬里尔？”邓布利多问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do it," said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater's robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat and, unmistakeably, of blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“动手吧。”站得离哈利最近的那个陌生人说，他四肢修长，灰色的头发和络腮胡子都纽结在一起，那件食死徒的黑袍子很不舒服地紧紧勒在身上。他的声音很古怪，是哈利从来没听过的：一种嘶嘶刺耳的咆哮。哈利还闻到他身上散发出一股冲鼻的怪味儿，混杂着泥土味、汗味，以及——毫无疑问——血腥味。他肮脏的手指上留着长长的黄指甲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Think your little jokes'll help you on your death bed, then?" she jeered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你都死到临头了，还以为这些小玩笑能救你的命？”她讥笑道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fenrir Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬里尔·格雷伯克咧嘴一笑，露出尖尖的牙齿。鲜血滴到他的下巴上，他慢慢地、令人恶心地舔着嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's right," rasped the other. "Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”那人用刺耳的声音说，“见到我很高兴吧，邓布利多？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's right," said Greyback. "Shocks you, that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得对，”格雷伯克说，“让你震惊了，是不是，邓布利多？让你害怕了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual… you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是否可以这样理解：现在即使在月亮不圆的日子你也要咬人？这可真奇怪……你养成了这种吃人肉的癖好，一个月一次都不能满足吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I cannot say that I am…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不能说很高兴……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你知道我是多么喜欢孩子，邓布利多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little," said Dumbledore. "And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，坦白地说，确实让我感到有些恶心，”邓布利多说，“而且，我是有点儿震惊：这位德拉科竟然偏偏把你请到他的朋友们居住的学校里来……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't," breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Greyback; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. "I didn't know he was going to come --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有，”马尔福喘着气说。他没有看格雷伯克，似乎连瞄都不愿意瞄他一眼。“我不知道他要来——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wouldn't want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore," rasped Greyback. "Not when there are throats to be ripped out… delicious, delicious…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不愿意错过到霍格沃茨来的美差，邓布利多。”格雷伯克用刺耳的声音说，“有这么多的喉咙可以撕开……味道真好，味道真好啊……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着，他举起一根黄黄的指甲剔起了大门牙，一边朝邓布利多狞笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore's face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马尔福更加没有斗志了。他看上去很害怕，呆呆地瞪着邓布利多的脸。邓布利多的脸色越发苍白，个头也显得比平常矮了许多，因为他靠在墙上的身体一直在往下出溜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus," said Dumbledore. "Old age, in short… one day, perhaps, it will happen to you… if you are lucky…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，体力不支，反应迟钝啊，阿米库斯。”邓布利多说，“总之，年老不中用啦……总有一天，你也会落到这步田地……如果你幸运的话……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以把你当成餐后的甜食，邓布利多……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. "We've got orders. Draco's got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不行。”第四个食死徒厉声说道。他满脸横肉，一副凶相。“我们有命令的。必须让德拉科动手。好了，德拉科，快行动吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at that moment, there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, "They've blocked the stairs -- Reducto! REDUCTO!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，下面又传来许多人混战的声音，其中一个人喊道：“他们把楼梯堵住了——粉身碎骨！粉身碎骨！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!" said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister's wheezing giggles. "Look at him -- what's happened to you, then, Dumby?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要我说，他在这个世界上的日子反正也不多了！”那个歪嘴男人说，他妹妹在一旁呼哧呼哧地笑着给他助阵，“你看看他——你这是怎么回事啊，邓老头儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's that mean, then, what's that mean?" yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. "Always the same, weren't yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing, I don't even know why the Dark Lord's bothering to kill yeh! Come on, Draco, do it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这话是什么意思？这话是什么意思？”食死徒喊道，突然变得凶狠起来，“你还是老样子，是不是，邓老头儿？满嘴空话，不干实事，我真弄不懂黑魔王为什么要把你干掉！好了，德拉科，快动手吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Til do it," snarled Greyback, moving towards Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来吧。”格雷伯克恶狠狠地说着就朝邓布利多逼了过去，他张开两只手，露出了嘴里的尖牙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry's heart leapt: so these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the Tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them -</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的心欢跳起来：这么说，这四个人并没有把对手完全消灭，他们只是突围出来跑到了塔楼顶上，而且，听下面的声音，他们好像在身后筑了一道路障——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Malfoy's hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是马尔福抖得太厉害了，没有办法瞄准目标。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Draco, do it, or stand aside so one of us --" screeched the woman, but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“德拉科，快动手，不然就闪开，让我们——”那女人尖声尖气地说。然而就在这时，通向围墙的门又一次被撞开了，斯内普攥着魔杖站在那里，一双黑眼睛迅速扫视着面前的场景，从瘫倒在墙上的邓布利多到那四个食死徒——其中包括气势汹汹的狼人，还有马尔福。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, Draco, quickly!" said the brutal-faced man angrily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快，德拉科，快动手吧！”一脸凶相的男人恼怒地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I said no!" shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry's heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore's spell -- if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说过不行！”一脸凶相的男人喊道。一道强光一闪，狼人被击到一边，撞在墙上，差点儿摔倒，脸上一副恼羞成怒的样子。哈利站在那儿，被邓布利多的魔咒束缚着，心咚咚跳得像打鼓一样，但竟然谁也听不见，这简直不可思议——只要他能够动弹，他就可以从隐形衣下面射出魔咒——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Snape said nothing, but walked forwards and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯内普没有说话，他走上前，粗暴地把马尔福推到一边。三个食死徒一言不发地闪到了后面，就连狼人似乎也被吓住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But somebody else had spoken Snape's name, quite softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是另外一个人念着斯内普的名字，声音很轻很轻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We've got a problem, Snape," said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, "the boy doesn't seem able --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们遇到难题了，斯内普，”体格粗壮的阿米库斯说，他的目光和魔杖都牢牢地盯住邓布利多，“这小伙子好像不能——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape's wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry's scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air: for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯内普的魔杖尖上射出一道绿光，不偏不倚地击中了邓布利多的脸膛。哈利惊恐的尖叫声被憋在了喉咙里，他发不出声音，也动弹不得，只能眼睁睁地望着邓布利多被击到空中。邓布利多似乎在那闪亮的骷髅下停留了一秒钟，然后像一个破烂的大玩偶似的，慢慢地仰面倒下去，从围墙的垛口上栽下去不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
