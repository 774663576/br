<div class="line_en">WE have as yet hardly spoken of the infant; that little creature, whose innocent life had sprung, by the inscrutable decree of Providence, a lovely and immortal flower, out of the rank luxuriance of a passion. How strange it seemed to the sad woman, as she watched the growth, and the beauty that became every day more brilliant, and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child! Her Pearl! -- For so had Hester called her; not as a name expressive of her aspect, which had nothing of the calm, white, unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison. But she named the infant "Pearl," as being of great price -- purchased with all she had -- her mother's only treasure! How strange, indeed! Man had marked this woman's sin by a scarlet letter, which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her, save it were sinful like herself. God, as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished, had given her a lovely child, whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom, to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven! Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne less with hope than apprehension. She knew that her deed had been evil; she could have no faith, therefore, that its result would be good. Day after day, she looked fearfully into the child's expanding nature; ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity, that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being.</div>

<div class="line_en">Certainly, there was no physical defect. By its perfect shape, its vigour, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs, the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden; worthy to have been left there, to be the plaything of the angels after theworld's first parents were driven out. The child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best. But little Pearl was not clad in rustic weeds. Her mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore, before the public eye. So magnificent was the small figure, when thus arrayed, and such was the splendour of Pearl's own proper beauty, shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her, on the darksome cottage floor. And yet a russet gown, torn and soiled with the child's rude play, made a picture of her just as perfect. Pearl's aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety; in this one child there were many children, comprehending the full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of an infant princess. Throughout all, however, there was a trait of passion, a certain depth of hue, which she never lost; and if, in any of her changes, she had grown fainter or paler, she would have ceased to be herself -- it would have been no longer Pearl!</div>

<div class="line_en">The discipline of the family, in those days, was of a far more rigid kind than now. The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequent application of the rod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, were used, not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences, but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues. Hester Prynne, nevertheless, the lonely mother of this one child, ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity. Mindful, however, of her own errors and misfortunes, she early sought to impose a tender, but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge. But the task was beyond her skill. After testing both smiles and frowns, and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence, Hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside, and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. Physical compulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while it lasted. As to any other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind or heart, little Pearl might or might not be within its reach, in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment. Her mother, while Pearl was yet an infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look, that warned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist, persuade, or plead. It was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable, so perverse, sometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that Hester could not help questioning, at such moments, whether Pearl was a human child. She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage-floor, would flit away with a mocking smile. Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility; it was as if she were hovering in the air and might vanish, like a glimmering light, that comes we know not whence, and goes we know not whither. Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush towards the child -- to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began -- to snatch her to her bosom, with a close pressure and earnest kisses -- not so much from overflowing love, as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood, and not utterly delusive. But Pearl's laugh, when she was caught, though full of merriment and music, made her mother more doubtful than before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当年的家规可耍比现在严厉得多。怒目瞪视、厉声呵斥和始手就打，全都有《圣经》可依，这些手段不仅是对错误言行的处罚，而且是作为培养儿童品德的有益措施。然而，海丝特·白兰和珠儿是寡母孤儿，她绝不会对孩子失之苛责。她多少出于自己的失足和不幸，早早便想对她受权负责的婴儿施以慈爱而严格的管教。但这一职责非她所能胜任。海丝特对珠儿试过用笑脸相劝或厉声训斥，但两种办法都不能奏效，最后只好被迫站在一旁，听凭孩子随心所欲了。当然，体罚和管柬在施行的当时还是有效的。至于对孩子思想或感情的任何其它教育开导，小珠儿也可能听，也可能不听，全看她当时是否高兴了。还在珠儿是婴儿的时候，她母亲就渐渐熟悉了她的一种特别的神情，那是在告诉母亲，此时对她的一切强制、劝说或请求都将无济于事。那一种神情极其聪慧，又极其费解，极其刚健，有时又极其凶狠，但总是伴随着一种奔放的情绪，令海丝特在此时无法盘洁，珠儿到底是不是一个凡人的子嗣。她更象是—个飘忽的精灵，在茅屋的地面上作过一阵奇思异想的游戏之后，使要面带嘲笑地飞走了。每逢她那狂野、明亮、漆黑的眼暗中出现那种神情时，她便蒙上一层远不可及的神秘色彩，仿佛正在空中翱翔，随时都可能消失，就象不知来自何处、去往何方的闪光似的。海丝特一看到这情景，就要象追逐逃跑的小精灵那样向孩子扑去，而珠儿也一定要开始逃跑；母亲抓住孩子，把她紧紧贴在胸前，热切地亲吻着，这样做倒不是出自爱的洋溢，而是使自己确信，珠儿是个血肉之躯，并非虚幻之物。但珠儿被抓住的时候，她咯咯的笑声中虽然充满欢乐和鸣，却使母亲较前益发困惑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How soon -- with what strange rapidity, indeed! -- did Pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse, beyond the mother's ever-ready smile and nonsense-words! And then what a happiness would it have been, could Hester Prynne have heard her clear, birdlike voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled her own darling's tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children! But this could never be. Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world. An imp of evil, emblem and product of sin, she had no right among christened infants. Nothing was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with which the child comprehended her loneliness; the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her; the whole peculiarity, in short, of her position in respect to other children. Never, since her release from prison, had Hester met the public gaze without her. In all her walks about the town, Pearl, too, was there; first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the little girl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger with her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of Hester's. She saw the children of the settlement, on the grassy margin of the street, or at the domestic thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the Puritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to church, perchance; or at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in a sham-fight with the Indians; or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft. Pearl saw, and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speak again. If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did, Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because they had so much the sound of a witch's anathemas in some unknown tongue.</div>

<div class="line_en">The truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived, had a vague idea of something outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, in the mother and child; and therefore scorned them in their hearts, and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues. Pearl felt the sentiment, and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom. These outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value, and even comfort, for her mother; because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child's manifestations. It appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself. All this enmity and passion had Pearl inherited, by inalienable right, out of Hester's heart. Mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society; and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted Hester Prynne before Pearl's birth, but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，这伙小清教徒们是世上最不容人的，他们早就在这对母女身上模模糊糊地看出点名堂，觉得她们不象是人世间的人，古里古怪地与众不同；于是便从心里蔑视她们，嘴里时常不干不净地诅咒她们。珠儿觉察出这种情绪，便以一个孩子心胸中所能激起的最刻毒的仇恨反唇相讥，这种大发脾气对她母亲颇有价值，甚至是一种慰藉，因为在这种气氛中，她至少表现出一种显而易见的真诚，替代了那种刺痛她母亲的一阵阵的任性发作。然而，海丝特吃惊地从中又辨出了曾存在她自己身上的那种邪恶的阴影的反射。这一切仇恨和热情，都是珠儿理所当然地从海丝特心中承袭下来的。母女二人一起被摒弃在人间社会之外，在珠儿降生之前折磨着海丝特·白兰，在孩子出生后随母性的温柔而渐渐平息下去的那些不安定成分，似乎都植根于珠儿的天性之中了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At home, within and around her mother's cottage, Pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of life went forth from her ever creative spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied. The unlikeliest materials -- a stick, a bunch of rags, a flower -- were the puppets of Pearl's witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward change, became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world. Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary personages, old and young, to talk withal. The pine-trees, aged, black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children, whom Pearl smote down and uprooted, most unmercifully. It was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity -- soon sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life -- and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy. It was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights. In the mere exercise of the fancy, however, and the sportiveness of a growing mind, there might be little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties; except as Pearl, in the dearth of human playmates, was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created. The singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offspring of her own heart and mind. She never created a friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon's teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies, against whom she rushed to battle. It was inexpressibly sad -- then what depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own heart the cause! -- to observe, in one so young, this constant recognition of an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause, in the contest that must ensue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珠儿在家中，并不想在母亲茅屋的里里外外结识很多各种各样的伙伴。她那永不停歇的创造精神会进发出生命的魔力，并同丰万种物体交流，犹如一个火炬可以点燃一切。那些最不值一玩的东西——一根棍子、一块破布、一朵小花——都是珠儿巫术的玩偶，而且无需经过任何外部变化，便可以在她内心世界的舞台上的任何戏剧中，派上想象中的用场。她用自己一人的童音扮作想象中的形形色色、老老少少的角色相互交谈。在风中哼哼唧唧或是发出其它忧郁呻吟的苍劲肃穆的松树，无需变形，就可充当清教徒的长者，面园中最丑陋的杂草便权充他们的子孙，珠儿会毫不留情地将这些“儿童”踩倒，再连根拔起。真是绝妙之极！她开动脑筋幻化出来的备色各样的形体，虽然缺乏连续性，但确实活脱跳跃，始终充满超越自然的活力——这种活力很快便消沉下去，仿佛在生命之潮的急剧而热烈的进发之中衰竭了，继之而来的又是另一种有狂野精力的形象。这和北极光的变幻不定极其相似。然而，单从一个正在成长着的头脑喜欢想象和活泼好动来说，珠儿比起其他聪慧的儿童并没有什么明显的长处，只不过是由于缺乏玩伴，她同自己创造出来的幻想中的人群更加接近而己。她的独特之处在于她对自己心灵和头脑中幻化出来的所有的人都怀着敌对情绪。她从来没有创造过一个朋友，却总象是在大面积地播种龙牙，从而收获到一支敌军，她便与之厮杀。看到孩子还这么年幼，居然对一个同自己作对的世界有如此坚定的认识，而且猛烈地训练自己的实力，以便在肯定会有的争斗中确保自己获胜，是多么让人心酸得难以形容啊！而当一个母亲在内心中体会到这一切都是由她才引起的，又是多么深切地哀伤啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One peculiarity of the child's deportment remains yet to be told. The very first thing which she had noticed, in her life, was -- what? -- not the mother's smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no means! But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was -- shall we say it? -- the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom! One day, as her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; and, putting up her little hand, she grasped at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the look of a much older child. Then, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavouring to tear it away; so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl's baby hand. Again, as if her mother's agonised gesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and smile! From that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment's safety; not a moment's calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile, and odd expression of the eyes.</div>

It was a face fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery. Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though less vividly, by the same illusion.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是你的天父把你送来的！”海丝特·白兰回答说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes; I am little Pearl!" repeated the child, continuing her antics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊！我是小珠儿！”孩子又说了一遍，同时继续着她的调皮动作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness, or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger, and touched the scarlet letter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她说话时有点犹豫，这没有逃过孩子犀利的目光。不知孩于和往常一样想要调皮，还是受到一个邪恶的精灵的指使，她举起她小小的食指，去摸那红字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!" said the mother, half playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her, in the midst of her deepest suffering. "Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee hither?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不是我的孩子！你不是我的珠儿！”母亲半开玩笑地说；因为就在她最为痛苦的时候，往往会涌来一阵寻开心的冲动。“那就告诉我吧，你是什么？是推把你打发到这儿来的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He did not send me!" cried she positively. "I have no Heavenly Father!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是他把我送来的！”她明确地说。“我没有天父！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!" answered the mother, suppressing a groan. "He sent us all into this world. He sent even me, thy mother. Then, much more, thee! Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘘，珠儿，嘘！你不许这么说！”母亲咽下一声哀叹，回答说。“我们所有的人都是他送到这世上来的。连我——你妈妈，都是他送来的。就更不用说你了！要不是这样，你这个怪里怪气的小妖精似的孩子是从哪儿来的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt. She remembered -- betwixt a smile and a shudder -- the talk of the neighbouring townspeople; who, seeking vainly elsewhere for the child's paternity, and observing some of her old attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring; such as, ever since old Catholic times, had occasionally been seer, on earth, through the agency of their mother's sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose. Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, was a brat of that hellish breed; nor was Pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned among the New England Puritans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对这一逼问，海丝特可没法作答了，因为连她自己也尚在阴暗的迷宫中徘徊呢。她面带微笑、周身战栗地想起了镇上邻居的说法，他们遍寻这孩子的父亲没有结果，又观察到珠儿的古怪作为，就声称可怜的小珠儿是一个妖魔助产物。自从古天主教时代以来，世上常见这种孩子，都是由于做母亲的有罪孽，才生下来以助长肮脏恶毒的目的。按照路德在教会中那些敌人的谣言，他本人就是那种恶魔的孽种；而在新英格兰的请教徒中闯，有这种可疑血缘的，可不仅仅珠儿一个孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell me! Tell me!" repeated Pearl, no longer seriously, but laughing, and capering about the floor. "It is thou that must tell me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“告诉我！告诉我！”珠儿一再喊着，这次不再板着面孔，而是笑出了声，还在地上跳着脚。“你非告诉我不可！">查看中文翻译</div>
