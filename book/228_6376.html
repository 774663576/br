<div class="line_en">"A merry Christmas, Bob!" said Scrooge, and it was clear that he meant It. "A merrier Christmas, Bob, than I've given you for a long time.

<div class="line_en">Scrooge did everything that he had promised, and more. To Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he became a second father. He became as good a friend, employer and man, as anyone in London or in the world. Some people laughed to see the change in him, but he did not care. His own heart laughed inside him, and that was good enough for him. He never had any more conversations with spirits, but kept Christmas cheerfully, and lived a happy life. That is what all of us want, and so, as Tiny Tim said, "God bless us, every one!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯克罗吉兑现了他所有的承诺，甚至更多。对小蒂姆来说，他根本没有死，他成了他的第二个父亲。他同伦敦或是全世界上的任何一个朋友、雇主和男人一样好。有人发现了他的变化就笑，但他不在乎。他从心里笑，这对他来说就够不错的了。他再也没有同幽灵们说过话，但圣诞节他一直过得都很快活，并且生活得很幸福。这也是我们大家共同的心愿，正如小蒂姆所说：“愿上帝保佑我们每个人！”">查看中文翻译</div>
