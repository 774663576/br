<div class="line_en">She awoke all at once, every nerve atingle. For a moment she did not remember where she was. She had dreamt that she was little, still sharing a bedchamber with her sister Arya. But it was her maid she heard tossing in sleep, not her sister, and this was not Winterfell, but the Eyrie. And I am Alayne Stone, a bastard girl. The room was cold and black, though she was warm beneath the blankets. Dawn had not yet come. Sometimes she dreamed of Ser Ilyn Payne and woke with her heart thumping, but this dream had not been like that. Home. It was a dream of home.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Eyrie was no home. It was no bigger than Maegor's Holdfast, and outside its sheer white walls was only the mountain and the long treacherous descent past Sky and Snow and Stone to the Gates of the Moon on the valley floor. There was no place to go and little to do. The older servants said these halls rang with laughter when her father and Robert Baratheon had been Jon Arryn's wards, but those days were many years gone. Her aunt kept a small household, and seldom permitted any guests to ascend past the Gates of the Moon. Aside from her aged maid, Sansa's only companion was the Lord Robert, eight going on three.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鹰巢城不是她的家。这里和梅葛楼差不多大小，纯白高墙外，唯有山脉和无穷无尽的虚空，一条长而险峻的小路通过长天堡、雪山堡和危岩堡，与底部的月门堡相连。她哪儿也去不了，什么都不能做。老仆人总说这里的厅堂回荡着当年她父亲和劳勃·拜拉席恩做琼恩·艾林养子期间留下的欢笑，可那是好久以前的事，而今她什么也感觉不到。姨妈身边的人不多，又很少准许宾客登上月门堡前来拜访。因此除了那位上年纪的侍女，珊莎的伙伴只有三岁婴儿般的劳勃公爵（其实他已八岁了）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lysa was as lonely as she was. Her new husband seemed to spend more time at the foot of the mountain than he did atop it. He was gone now, had been gone the past four days, meeting with the Corbrays. From bits and pieces of overheard conversations Sansa knew that Jon Arryn's bannermen resented Lysa's marriage and begrudged Petyr his authority as Lord Protector of the Vale. The senior branch of House Royce was close to open revolt over her aunt's failure to aid Robb in his war, and the Waynwoods, Redforts, Belmores, and Templetons were giving them every support. The mountain clans were being troublesome as well, and old Lord Hunter had died so suddenly that his two younger sons were accusing their elder brother of having murdered him. The Vale of Arryn might have been spared the worst of the war, but it was hardly the idyllic place that Lady Lysa had made it out to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="姨妈好孤单。她的新婚夫婿在山下待的时间远远多于留在鹰巢城的光阴。现今他就在山下，一连四天与科布瑞家族会谈。从偷听来的只言片语中，珊莎知道琼恩·艾林的封臣们怨恨莱莎的婚姻，嫉妒培提尔获得峡谷守护者的权威。逮着姨妈不肯发兵援助罗柏的罪状，罗伊斯家族的本家处于公开叛乱的边缘，韦伍德家族、雷德福家族、贝尔摩家族及坦帕顿家族都全力支持青铜约恩的行动。山区原住民难以控制，老伯爵杭特又在这节骨眼上突然病逝，他的两名幼子不约而同地指责长兄谋害父亲。艾林谷一直没卷入战局，可如今莱莎夫人想保持和平的目标是越来越难以实现了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Marillion. There is always Marillion. When he played for them at supper, the young singer often seemed to be singing directly at her. Her aunt was far from pleased.

<div class="line_en">Outside the flakes drifted down as soft and silent as memory. Was this what woke me? Already the snowfall lay thick upon the garden below, blanketing the grass, dusting the shrubs and statues with white and weighing down the branches of the trees. The sight took Sansa back to cold nights long ago, in the long summer of her childhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪花纷飞，如回忆一般轻柔而沉默。是它唤醒了我？下面的花园里，积雪已然很深，盖住青草，为雕像披上洁白的外衣，压弯了矮树枝头，令珊莎想起很久以前的夜晚，想起了长夏里的童年。">查看中文翻译</div>

Hullen had helped her mount, and she'd ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around her, off to see the great wide world. I thought my song was beginning that day, but it was almost done.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her maid rolled herself more tightly in her blanket as the snow began to drift in the window. Sansa eased open the door, and made her way down the winding stair. When she opened the door to the garden, it was so lovely that she held her breath, unwilling to disturb such perfect beauty. The snow drifted down and down, all in ghostly silence, and lay thick and unbroken on the ground. All color had fled the world outside. It was a place of whites and blacks and greys. White towers and white snow and white statues, black shadows and black trees, the dark grey sky above. A pure world, Sansa thought. I do not belong here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪花飘进房间，侍女下意识地裹紧毯子。珊莎打开房门，走下螺旋梯。当她接着打开通往花园的大门时，眼前的美景让她不由得屏住呼吸，惊讶于那份不属于人间的宁静。雪花飘啊飘，悠远的暗香与孤寂，它们沉甸甸、不受打扰地着陆。人间的全部色彩纷纷败下阵来，遁逃无踪，唯有黑、白和灰：白的高塔、白的雪和白的雕像，黑的影子与黑的树，灰的天空。一个纯粹的世界，珊莎心想，一个不属于我的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sansa left the shutters open as she dressed. It would be cold, she knew, though the Eyrie's towers encircled the garden and protected it from the worst of the mountain winds. She donned silken smallclothes and a linen shift, and over that a warm dress of blue lambswool. Two pairs of hose for her legs, boots that laced up to her knees, heavy leather gloves, and finally a hooded cloak of soft white fox fur.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet she stepped out all the same. Her boots tore ankle-deep holes into the smooth white surface of the snow, yet made no sound. Sansa drifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees, and wondered if she were still dreaming. Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover's kisses, and melted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她如梦似幻地踏步出门，靴子在顺滑的白雪表面留下及踝深的孔洞，却没发出任何声音。她走过结霜的矮木丛，望着细瘦的黑树干，不知自己是否仍在梦中。飘飞的雪花犹如情人温柔的亲吻，划过脸庞，因体温而融化。她来到花园中央，站在倒塌、半埋没的哭泣女人雕像旁，闭上双眼，举头向天。她闻到雪花的舞蹈，品尝着雪的滋味。这是临冬城的滋味，清白的滋味，梦的滋味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Sansa opened her eyes again, she was on her knees. She did not remember falling. it seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey. Dawn, she thought. Another day. Another new day. It was the old days she hungered for. Prayed for. But who could she pray to? The garden had been meant for a godswood once, she knew, but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root. A godswood without gods, as empty as me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她睁开眼睛，发觉自己已然下跪，却不记得其中经过。天空泛白，黎明来到。这是新的一天，她心想，指引着未来。可她渴望的却是回到过去，祈祷能回到过去。她应该对谁祈祷？这座小花园原本是要栽培成神木林的，但土壤过于细薄多石，鱼梁木难以生根。一座没有心树、没有神灵的神木林，和我一样，空虚，空虚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What do I want with snowballs? She looked at her sad little arsenal. There's no one to throw them at. She let the one she was making drop from her hand. I could build a snow knight instead, she thought. Or even…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而今我有了雪球，又拿它来做什么呢？她望着手中可怜的小玩意儿，悲伤地想，这里没有人跟我打雪仗。珊莎松手，雪球砸在地上，碎了。但我可以做个雪骑士，她决定，或者…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She scooped up a handful of snow and squeezed it between her fingers. Heavy and wet, the snow packed easily. Sansa began to make snowballs, shaping and smoothing them until they were round and white and perfect. She remembered a summer's snow in Winterfell when Arya and Bran had ambushed her as she emerged from the keep one morning. They'd each had a dozen snowballs to hand, and she'd had none. Bran had been perched on the roof of the covered bridge, out of reach, but Sansa had chased Arya through the stables and around the kitchen until both of them were breathless. She might even have caught her, but she'd slipped on some ice. Her sister came back to see if she was hurt. When she said she wasn't, Arya hit her in the face with another snowball, but Sansa grabbed her leg and pulled her down and was rubbing snow in her hair when Jory came along and pulled them apart, laughing.</div>

<div class="line_en">She pushed two of her snowballs together, added a third, packed more snow in around them, and patted the whole thing into the shape of a cylinder. When it was done, she stood it on end and used the tip of her little finger to poke holes in it for windows. The crenellations around the top took a little more care, but when they were done she had a tower. I need some walls now, Sansa thought, and then a keep. She set to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她赶紧捏好三个雪球，合在一起，再补上新雪，塑成圆柱体。随后珊莎站起来，用小手指指甲在柱体上挖洞，作为窗户。顶端的城垛最难弄，她花了好长时间，才让柱体看起来像塔楼的样子。还有城墙，珊莎心想，还有主堡。她狂热地投入工作中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The snow fell and the castle rose. Two walls ankle-high, the inner taller than the outer. Towers and turrets, keeps and stairs, a round kitchen, a square armory, the stables along the inside of the west wall. It was only a castle when she began, but before very long Sansa knew it was Winterfell. She found twigs and fallen branches beneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood. For the gravestones in the lichyard she used bits of bark. Soon her gloves and her boots were crusty white, her hands were tingling, and her feet were soaked and cold, but she did not care. The castle was all that mattered. Some things were hard to remember, but most came back to her easily, as if she had been there only yesterday. The Library Tower, with the steep stonework stair twisting about its exterior. The gatehouse, two huge bulwarks, the arched gate between them, crenellations all along the top…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪花飘落，城堡升起。她搭起两道及踝高的雪墙，内墙高过外墙；她搭起塔楼和角楼、堡垒与阶梯；她搭起一座圆形厨房、一座方形兵器库，还有西墙内侧的马厩。开始工作时，她只想搭座城堡，但在心中，一直都明白这其实就是临冬城。积雪之下，她找到枯枝和落木，便折其末梢，用来做神木林。点点树皮则成了墓园中的碑石。手套和靴子结了冰，指头麻木，脚掌又湿又冷，但她浑不在意，只关心城堡。座座建筑在脑海中历历在目，犹如昨日才刚别离。藏书塔外壁有陡峭蜿蜒的石制螺旋梯；城门楼是两个巨型堡垒，中央一道拱门，堡垒顶上开了无数垛口…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her bridges kept falling down. There was a covered bridge between the armory and the main keep, and another that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower to the second floor of the rookery, but no matter how carefully she shaped them, they would not hold together. The third time one collapsed on her, she cursed aloud and sat back in helpless frustration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桥梁始终做不牢固。兵器库和主堡之间，有一座密闭桥梁，还有另一座桥从钟塔四楼直通鸦巢的二层。但不管她如何细心琢磨，它们就是无法保持平衡。当桥梁第三次倒塌时，珊莎大声咒骂，绝望地坐倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And all the while the snow kept falling, piling up in drifts around her buildings as fast as she raised them. She was patting down the pitched roof of the Great Hall when she heard a voice, and looked up to see her maid calling from her window. Was my lady well? Did she wish to break her fast? Sansa shook her head, and went back to shaping snow, adding a chimney to one end of the Great Hall, where the hearth would stand inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一边做，雪一边往下滑，很快，旁边堆起的残雪，就和建筑物本身一样高了。当她细心拍打，描绘出城堡大厅的斜顶时，身后传来一声呼喊。她抬起头，看见侍女站在窗边，“小姐，您好吗？用早餐吗？”珊莎摇摇头，埋头继续工作。这次她在大厅顶部加上一个烟囱，那是壁炉的所在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dawn stole into her garden like a thief. The grey of the sky grew lighter still, and the trees and shrubs turned a dark green beneath their stoles of snow. A few servants came out and watched her for a time, but she paid them no mind and they soon went back inside where it was warmer. Sansa saw Lady Lysa gazing down from her balcony, wrapped up in a blue velvet robe trimmed with fox fur, but when she looked again her aunt was gone. Maester Colemon popped out of the rookery and peered down for a while, skinny and shivering but curious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黎明犹如盗贼，偷偷潜进小花园。灰色的天空持续放亮，积雪之下，树枝和灌木显出暗绿的色泽。仆人们走进花园，默默地打量，她没有回头，于是人们又纷纷回到温暖的塔内。莱莎夫人裹一身镶狐皮的蓝天鹅绒长袍站在阳台上观察，但等她再度抬头，姨妈已不见了。骨瘦如柴、浑身颤抖的柯蒙学士将头探出鸦巢，向下审视了一会儿，目光中充满好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Littlefinger stroked his chin, where his beard had been before Lysa had asked him to shave it off. "The glass was locked in frames, no? Twigs are your answer. Peel them and cross them and use bark to tie them together into frames. I'll show you." He moved through the garden, gathering up twigs and sticks and shaking the snow from them. When he had enough, he stepped over both walls with a single long stride and squatted on his heels in the middle of the yard. Sansa came closer to watch what he was doing. His hands were deft and sure, and before long he had a crisscrossing latticework of twigs, very like the one that roofed the glass gardens of Winterfell. "We will need to imagine the glass, to be sure," he said when he gave it to her.</div>

The First Keep was simple enough, an old round drum tower, but Sansa was stymied again when it came to putting the gargoyles around the top. Again he had the answer.

<div class="line_en">I will tell my aunt that I don't want to marry Robert. Not even the High Septon himself could declare a woman married if she refused to say the vows. She wasn't a beggar, no matter what her aunt said. She was thirteen, a woman flowered and wed, the heir to Winterfell. Sansa felt sorry for her little cousin sometimes, but she could not imagine ever wanting to be his wife. I would sooner be married to Tyrion again.

<div class="line_en">Marillion was comely, there was no denying it; boyish and slender, with smooth skin, sandy hair, a charming smile.

To hear the servants talk, Sansa was not the first maid to suffer his advances, and the others had not had Lothor Brune to defend them. But Lady Lysa would hear no complaints against him. Since coming to the Eyrie, the singer had become her favorite. He sang Lord Robert to sleep every night, and tweaked the noses of Lady Lysa's suitors with verses that made mock of their foibles. Her aunt had showered him with gold and gifts; costly clothes, a gold arm ring, a belt studded with moonstones, a fine horse. She had even given him her late husband's favorite falcon. It all served to make Marillion unfailingly courteous in Lady Lysa's presence, and unfailingly arrogant outside it.</div>

Lord Bracken's singer played for us, and Catelyn danced six dances with Petyr that night, six, I counted. When the lords began to argue my father took them up to his audience chamber, so there was no one to stop us drinking. Edmure got drunk, young as he was… and Petyr tried to kiss your mother, only she pushed him away. She laughed at him.

<div class="line_en">All of Sansa's resolve had withered in the face of her aunt's onslaught. Lysa Arryn was frightening her as much as Queen Cersei ever had. "He's yours, my lady," she said, trying to sound meek and contrite. "May I have your leave to go?"</div>

That was the night I stole up to his bed to give him comfort. I bled, but it was the sweetest hurt. He told me he loved me then, but he called me Cat, just before he fell back to sleep. Even so, I stayed with him until the sky began to lighten. Your mother did not deserve him. She would not even give him her favor to wear when he fought Brandon Stark. I would have given him my favor. I gave him everything. He is mine now. Not Catelyn's and not yours."</div>

How would you like to spend your life on that bleak shore, surrounded by slatterns and sheep pellets? That was what my father meant for Petyr. Everyone thought it was because of that stupid duel with Brandon Stark, but that wasn't so. Father said I ought to thank the gods that so great a lord as Jon Arryn was willing to take me soiled, but I knew it was only for the swords. I had to marry Jon, or my father would have turned me out as he did his brother, but it was Petyr I was meant for. I am telling you all this so you will understand how much we love each other, how long we have suffered and dreamed of one another. We made a baby together, a precious little baby." Lysa put her hands flat against her belly, as if the child was still there. "When they stole him from me, I made a promise to myself that I would never let it happen again. Jon wished to send my sweet Robert to Dragonstone, and that sot of a king would have given him to Cersei Lannister, but I never let them… no more than I'll let you steal my Petyr Littlefinger.

Snow had piled up around the frame, and it all came blowing in at them, borne on a blast of cold air that left Sansa shivering. She tried to step backward, but her aunt was behind her.

"Don't!" Sansa screamed. "You're scaring me! " Behind her, Marillion was still playing his woodharp and singing, "Hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey."</div>

Her aunt outweighed her by three stone. "The lady lay a-kissing, upon a mound of hay," Marillion was singing. Sansa twisted sideways, hysterical with fear, and one foot slipped out over the void. She screamed. "Hey-nonny, hey-nonny, hey-nonny-hey." The wind flapped her skirts up and bit at her bare legs with cold teeth. She could feel snowflakes melting on her cheeks. Sansa flailed, found Lysa's thick auburn braid, and clutched it tight. "My hair!" her aunt shrieked. "Let go of my hair!" She was shaking, sobbing. They teetered on the edge.

I would have given you a son too, but they murdered him with moon tea, with tansy and mint and wormwood, a spoon of honey and a drop of permyroyal. It wasn't me, I never knew, I only drank what Father gave me…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tears, tears, tears," she sobbed hysterically. "No need for tears… but that's not what you said in King's Landing. You told me to put the tears in Jon's wine, and I did. For Robert, and for us! And I wrote Catelyn and told her the Lannisters had killed my lord husband, just as you said. That was so clever… you were always clever, I told Father that, I said Petyr's so clever, he'll rise high, he will, he will, and he's sweet and gentle and I have his little baby in my belly… Why did you kiss her? Why? We're together now, we're together after so long, so very long, why would you want to kiss herrrrrr?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Lysa threw herself into Littlefinger's arms, sobbing. As they hugged, Sansa crawled from the Moon Door on hands and knees and wrapped her arms around the nearest pillar. She could feel her heart pounding. There was snow in her hair and her right shoe was missing. It must have fallen. She shuddered, and hugged the pillar tighter.</div>
