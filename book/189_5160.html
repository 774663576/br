<div class="line_en">The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back. The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The man stopped too.</div>

<div class="line_en">A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河面上笼罩着一层雾气，停泊在各个码头上的小船燃点起的红色灯火因而显得颜色更深，岸边阴沉混沌的建筑物显得越发昏暗朦胧。沿河两岸一些货栈早就被烟雾熏得污迹斑斑，呆板而又忧郁地从密密层层的屋顶、山墙中耸立起来，冷森森地向水面皱着眉头事功。于赋、兵制、地形、水利诸方面亦下功夫。以世道兴，乌黑的河水连它们那粗大丑陋的样子也照不出来。幽暗中，古老的救世主教堂的钟楼和圣玛格纳斯教堂尖顶隐隐可见，依旧像两个巨灵神守卫着这座历史悠久的大桥，但桥下林立的船桅与岸上星罗棋布的教堂尖顶几乎全都看不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were, hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London's destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十二点敲过不到两分钟，在离大桥很近的地方，一个少女由一位鬓发斑白的绅士陪伴着，从一辆出租马车上下来，将马车打发走，便直端端往桥上走来。他们刚踏上便道，姑娘猛然惊起，立即迎上前去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro -- closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer -- when the heavy bell of St. Paul's tolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded city. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate. They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up -- brushed against them, indeed -- at that precise moment.</div>

<div class="line_en">These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这下可够远的了，”一个声音说道，显然是那位绅士的嗓音，“我不能叫这位小姐再往前走了。换了别人，都会对你信不过，连此地也不肯来的，可你也看得出，我愿意顺着你的心思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation. He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，为什么呢，”绅士的口气温和了一些，“你把我们带到这么一个不可思议的地方，到底是出于什么目的？你干吗不让我和你在上边谈，那地方有灯，又有人走动，却偏要引我们到这个荒凉的黑窟窿里来？”">查看中文翻译</div>

I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我简直不知道是怎么回事，”姑娘回答，“要知道就好了。我一整天想的都是可怕的念头，死神，带血的裹尸布，越害怕身上越发烫，像是给架在火上烤一样。今天晚上我看了一本书，想混混时间，这些东西又从书上跑出来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that night. From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated. When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He is tall," said the girl, "and a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don't forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man's, that you might almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can't be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds -- why did you start?" said the girl, stopping suddenly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他个儿高高的，”姑娘说道，“长得很结实，不胖，走路的样子鬼鬼祟祟的，老是回头看，先瞧瞧这一边，然后又瞧瞧另一边。别忘了，因为他的眼睛往里凹，比哪一个男人都深得多，你单凭这一点就完全可以把他认出来。脸黑黑的，头发和眼睛也一样。尽管大不了二十六岁，就算二十八岁吧，皮肤已经长了很多褶子，挺憔悴的。他的嘴唇经常没有血色，齿痕很深。他一抽筋就不得了，有时候咬得手上满是伤痕――你干吗吓一大跳？”姑娘说着，猝然停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

"The past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you. Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!"</div>
