<div class="line_en">"Here it is!" he cried. "There is a way down inside, yes. Now we follows it -- out, out away over there." He pointed south and east towards the marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in the cool night air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called to them. "Here! We can get down here. Sméagol went this way once: I went this way, hiding from Orcs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁沿着裂隙往下走，最后他回头大喊：“来吧！我们可以从这边下去，史麦戈以前来过这里，我就是在这边躲过半兽人的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gollum moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, often using his hands as well as his feet. Frodo and Sam were hard put to it to keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. After a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; but they were now further from the hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁的动作很快，他的脑袋一直往前伸，双手也经常代替脚的功用。佛罗多和山姆得十分辛苦才能够赶上他，但他似乎不再想要逃跑了。如果他们落后了，他会转过身等待他们。过了一段时间之后，他带着两人来到一个之前曾经看到过的狭窄溪谷，但这次距离爱明莫尔又远了一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom. It was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. There was running water at the bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond. Gollum turned to the right, southward more or less, and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream. He seemed greatly delighted to feel the water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他领着路，哈比人们跟着他爬下裂隙。一路上并不难走，因为裂隙在这附近只有十五尺深，十几尺宽而已。底下果然有溪水在奔流，事实上，这就是众多由山上流下，供给恶臭沼泽积水的小溪之一。咕鲁转过身，朝着南边走去，有蹼的脚踏着浅而多岩的小溪，能碰到水似乎让他觉得很高兴，有时他会咯咯的笑，甚至挤出某种曲调难辨的歌曲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Day is near," he whispered, as if Day was something that might overhear him and spring on him. "Sméagol will stay here: I will stay here, and the Yellow Face won't see me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快白天了，”他低声说，彷佛白天是种会悄悄跟上来偷袭他的怪兽。“史麦戈留在这里，我会留在这里，这样大黄脸就不会看见我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are not wise to be glad of the Yellow Face," said Gollum. "It shows you up. Nice sensible hobbits stay with Sméagol. Orcs and nasty things are about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看到黄脸会觉得高兴，你实在不太聪明，”咕鲁说：“它会让你被看见，聪明讲理的哈比人会和史麦戈在一起，到处都有半兽人和怪物，他们可以看到很远的东西。和我一起躲！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not too well," thought Sam. "He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like, if there ain't no fish, I'll wager -- supposing as he could catch us napping. Well, he won't: not Sam Gamgee for one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜多半吃得不怎么样，”山姆想：“他看起来瘦巴巴的。如果没有鱼的话，我看他很可能会想要尝尝哈比人的味道。我敢打赌，如果他遇上我们打盹的时候，一定会这样做的。哼哼，我绝不会让他得逞的，山姆绝不会当他的牺牲者！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning. Gollum had shown no signs of tiring, but now he looked up and halted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在溪谷里面踉跄地走了很长的一段时间，至少对于全身酸痛的佛罗多和山姆来说是这样的。溪谷往东蜿蜒，随着他们的前进，溪水越来越浅，河道越来越宽，最后，天空终于冒出了些许的曙光。咕鲁看起来并不疲倦，但他却停下脚步抬起头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in Gollum's pale eyes, and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For a moment he relapsed into his old Gollum-manner. "We are famisshed, yes famisshed we are, precious," he said. "What is it they eats? Have they nice fisshes?" His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth, licking his colourless lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一听见饿这个字，咕鲁的眼中就亮起了绿色光芒，那双眼睛似乎比平常还要突出许多。一瞬间，他似乎又恢复了原先的行为模式。“我们好饿，嘶嘶的，我们好饿，宝贝，”他说：“他们吃什么？他们有没有好吃的鱼？”他的舌头从黄色的利齿间钻了出来，舔舐着苍白的嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, we have got no fish," said Frodo. "We have only got this" -- he held up a wafer of lembas -- "and water, if the water here is fit to drink."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我们没有鱼，”佛罗多说：“我们只有这个──”他拿起一片精灵的干粮说：“还有水，希望这边的水可以喝。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. It was not much more than a tall man's height now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel on the other side. Frodo and Sam sat on one of the flats, resting their backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三人靠着溪谷边的山壁开始休息，附近的山壁不过只有一名人类的高度，在底下还有许多完全没被淋湿的石头凹槽，溪水则是在另一边流着，佛罗多和山姆躺在凹槽里面休息着。咕鲁在溪水里面打滚，似乎在找些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yess, yess, nice water," said Gollum. "Drink it, drink it, while we can! But what is it they've got, precious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its leaf-wrapping. Gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. "Sméagol smells it!" he said. "Leaves out of the Elf-country, gah! They stinks. He climbed in those trees, and he couldn't wash the smell off his hands, my nice hands." Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it. He spat, and a fit of coughing shook him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多掰下一片‘兰巴斯’，放在原先包装干粮的叶子上递给他。咕鲁闻了闻，表情立刻就变了，他露出恶心和厌恶交杂的扭曲表情，似乎又准备露出以往那恶狠狠的样子。“史麦戈闻到了！”他说：“精灵住所出来的叶子！恶！好臭。他爬过那些树，就一直洗不掉手上的味道，我可爱的手啊。”他丢掉叶子，拿了一小角兰巴斯，咬了一口；立刻吐出来，开始剧烈咳嗽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ach! No!" he spluttered. "You try to choke poor Sméagol. Dust and ashes, he can't eat that. He must starve. But Sméagol doesn't mind. Nice hobbits! Sméagol has promised. He will starve. He can't eat hobbits' food. He will starve. Poor thin Sméagol!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！不！”他口齿不清地说：“你们想要呛死史麦戈！吃起来像灰尘，不能吃，他得饿肚子了，但史麦戈不在乎。好哈比人！史麦戈答应过了，他要饿肚子。他不能吃哈比人的食物，他要饿肚子，可怜的瘦瘦史麦戈！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits munched their lembas in silence. Sam thought that it tasted far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: Gollum's behaviour had made him attend to its flavour again. But he did not feel comfortable. Gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a diner's chair. Only when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人沉默地嚼着，兰巴斯。山姆觉得自己又可以享受这干粮的美味了，咕鲁的反应让他又注意起这东西的味道，但他并不觉得安全。咕鲁看着他们每一个用餐的动作，好象是餐桌边的忠狗一样。只有当他们吃完收拾好东西准备休息的时候，他才终于相信他们没有藏起任何好东西。然后，他就转身离开，坐在比较远的地方哼哼叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," said Frodo; "but I can't help you, I'm afraid. I think this food would do you good, if you would try. But perhaps you can't even try, not yet anyway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抱歉，”佛罗多说：“可惜我帮不上忙，我本来还以为这食物可以让你更健康一些，只要你愿意试试，不过，看来你连试都没办法。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So tired was Frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept, almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to have any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, but he lay still as stone. After a while, fearing that he would drop off himself, if he sat listening to his two companions breathing, Sam got up and gently prodded Gollum. His hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other movement. Sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no response, not even a catch in Gollum's breathing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多累到几乎话一说完，头就往前倒向胸口，立刻睡着了。咕鲁似乎不再害怕，他蜷成一团，蛮不在乎地开始睡觉，他的呼吸穿过齿间，发出恼人的嘶嘶声，但至少他并没有任何轻举妄动的迹象。过了不久之后，山姆担心自己如果只是听着同伴的呼吸声，多半也会睡着，因此赶忙站起来，小心翼翼地戳戳咕鲁。他的手抽动了一下，但没有任何其它的反应。山姆弯下身，在他的耳边低声说：“有鱼！”但对方还是一点反应也没有，连呼吸都没有丝毫的改变。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look here!" Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really care whether Gollum heard him or not. "We've got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Sméagol or Gollum, he won't change his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant. You go to sleep, Mr. Frodo, and I'll call you when I can't keep my eyelids propped up. Turn and about, same as before, while he's loose."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着！”山姆对佛罗多耳语道，但其实声音并不是那么的小，他并不介意咕鲁到底听不听得到：“我们得要休息，但是有这个饥肠辘辘的坏蛋在附近，我们不能够两个人同时睡着，不管他有没有发誓都一样。不管是史麦戈还是咕鲁，旧习难改啊！佛罗多先生，你先睡，我会撑到眼睛睁不开的时候再叫你。在他到处乱跑的时候，我们必须要小心提防。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps you're right, Sam," said Frodo speaking openly. "There is a change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, I'm not sure yet. Seriously though, I don't think there is any need for fear -- at present. Still watch if you wish. Give me about two hours, not more, and then call me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆，或许你说的没错，”佛罗多刻意大声地说：“他的确有了些改变，但究竟是什么改变，又有多深刻，我都还不确定。不过，认真的说，我并不认为现在有必要太担心；不过，如果你想的话，还是花点时间监视他。给我两小时，然后叫我起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam scratched his head. "Must really be asleep," he muttered. "And if I was like Gollum, he wouldn't wake up never again." He restrained the thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat down by his master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆搔搔头说：“多半是真的睡着了！”他喃喃自语道：“如果我像咕鲁一样，这家伙就永远没机会醒来了。”他强自压抑住浮现在脑中的宝剑和绳子的影像，走回主人身边坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. Gollum was not to be seen. Various reproachful names for himself came to Sam's mind, drawn from the Gaffer's large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any rate both alive and unthrottled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他醒来的时候，天空已经黯淡下来，并不比他们用早餐的时候明亮到哪里去。山姆立刻跳起来。这不是因为他觉得精力充沛或是肚子饿，而是因为他突然间意识到，自己已经睡过了整个白天，至少九个小时！佛罗多依旧睡得很熟，四仰八叉地躺在地上，咕鲁不见了。山姆开始从老家伙的丰富词汇中，找出各种各样责备自己的话语，同时，他也想到主人的看法是正确的：至少目前他们根本没有什么需要担心的地方。两个人都好好的，没有受到任何的威胁。">查看中文翻译</div>

They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have retraced their steps a little, and then turning east have come round over hard roads to the bare plain of Dagorlad: the field of the ancient battle before the gates of Mordor. Not that there was great hope in such a course. On that stony plain there was no cover, and across it ran the highways of the Orcs and the soldiers of the Enemy.

Lots of His people will be there looking out for guests, very pleased to take them straight to Him, O yes. His Eye watches that way all the time. It caught Sméagol there, long ago." Gollum shuddered. "But Sméagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: I've used eyes and feet and nose since then. I know other ways. More difficult, not so quick; but better, if we don't want Him to see.

<div class="line_en">Frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went, he often lagged. The hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really an endless network of pools, and soft mires, and winding half-strangled water-courses. Among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path. Gollum certainly had that cunning, and needed all of it. His head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that, while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing the ground with fingers or toes, or merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country.

Far above the rot and vapours of the world the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her could they see below, bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. But even at this faint reminder of her presence Gollum scowled and flinched. He halted their journey, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the borders of a great brown reed-thicket. There was a deep silence, only scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken grass-blades trembling in small air-movements that they could not feel.</div>

For some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo and Sam it seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. They shivered.

<div class="line_en">In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. But far more he was troubled by the Eye: so he called it to himself. It was that more than the drag of the Ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked. The Eye: that horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become that still warded it off. Frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its potency beat upon his brow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，佛罗多每往魔多的大门踏进一步，就越觉得挂在脖子上的魔戒越重几分；他现在开始觉得魔戒的重量，似乎拖着他不停地往地面弯腰。但他更困扰的是那双魔眼，这是他自己对它的称呼，它的压力远远胜过魔戒，更让他走路的时候抬不起头来。那双魔眼是一种邪恶、不断滋长的敌意，你可以清楚地感觉到它上山下海、突破一切重围和险阻，就是想要找到你，让你赤裸裸地被锁死在对方的视线之下。佛罗多知道那双眼睛背后的意志位在什么地方，就像普通人闭着眼睛也可以知道太阳的方向一样。他正面对那方向，那一波波涌来的力量不停地击打着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From that time on Sam thought that he sensed a change in Gollum again. He was more fawning and would-be friendly; but Sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. And Sam had another growing anxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said nothing, indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那时候开始，山姆认为咕鲁又有了改变。他变得更奉承、更巴结，但山姆有时会惊讶地发现他眼中会闪动着奇异的光芒，特别是在看着佛罗多的时候。然且，他也会越来越常使用原先说话的口气。山姆还有另外一个担心的地方：佛罗多似乎很疲倦，疲倦得快要倒下，他没有抱怨，事实上，他几乎连句话都不说，但走起路来的姿态却像是背着沉重负担的旅人，而且，这重量似乎还在不停地增加，让他的速度越来越慢。最后，山姆必须经常拜托咕鲁停下脚步，等待主人跟上来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gollum probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess. Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was occupied mostly with his master, hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. He put Frodo in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and trying to encourage him with clumsy words.</div>

The air was now clearer and colder, and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace on the edge of sight, but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal waste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and pitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron's gate.</div>

The remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon. For two more nights they struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them, grew harsh, and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last, on the fifth morning since they took the road with Gollum, they halted once more. Before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away. Frodo looked round in horror. Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had been, and the arid moors of the Noman-lands, more loathsome far was the country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes. Even to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring would come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here nothing lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，到了第五天的早晨，他们又再度停了下来。在他们眼前，曙光的照耀下，魔多的山脉已经成了遮蔽天空的巨大障碍，从山脚下延伸出许多断碎的丘陵，最近的也有十几哩。佛罗多恐惧地四处张望，即使经历了死亡沼泽的恐怖，和眼前这块荒凉大地的威胁，但让他心中充满恐惧的，还是那块在晨光之下缓缓在他面前揭开面纱的邪恶之境。即使在那充满了亡灵的沼泽中，依旧有些残破的绿意保存下来；但是，在这里，不管是春天或是夏天，永远都不会有任何的绿意。这里寸草不生、万物雕零，连凭借着腐败之物就可以生长的苔藓或是蕨类，都无法在此苟活。在这里地面上的凹洞，被泛着病态死灰色的泥土和烟灰所覆盖，仿佛山脉将它们垂死的血脉都吐在山脚下。许多化为粉尘的岩石接堆积在这里，由火焰和高温所形成的巨大石柱也矗立在此地，看起来像是无穷无尽的墓地中的墓碑一般。这些，就是佛罗多在晨光下所看见的景象。">查看中文翻译</div>

Spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. Frodo and Sam crawled after him until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye.</div>

A great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops from their bottles -- last filled in the gully, which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The hobbits took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to be on guard. He lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark riding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hovering between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that Gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in Gollum. He realized now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible call of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who She was. One of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, he supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs, but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.</div>

<div class="line_en">Strangely enough, Frodo felt refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed him with dog-like delight. He chuckled and chattered, cracking his long fingers, and pawing at Frodo's knees. Frodo smiled at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诡异的是，佛罗多觉得神清气爽，他之前一直在作梦，黑暗的阴影已经消退了，在这块暗影潜伏的大地上竟然有美丽的影像来拜访他。他记不起来到底是什么，但却知道自己因为那影像而觉得心情轻松，又很高兴，他的重担似乎也变得比较轻了些。咕鲁兴高采烈地欢迎他，他咯咯笑着，拍打着细长的手指，边摸着佛罗多的膝盖，佛罗多对他露出微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. "Nice hobbits! Nice Sam!" he said. "Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Sméagol to watch! But it's evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁从齿缝间发出了一声长长的嘶嘶声，他站了起来，全身肌肉紧绷，似乎准备做些什么，然后他又趴了下去，四肢着地爬到坑洞边。“好哈比人，好山姆！”他说：“头晖晖，是啊，头晖晖！让好史麦戈来看守！不过，已经傍晚了，天色已经渐渐暗下来，该走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"High time!" thought Sam. "And time we parted, too." Yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them. "Curse him! I wish he was choked!" he muttered. He stumbled down the bank and roused his master.</div>

<div class="line_en">"To the Gate, eh?" Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. "To the Gate, master says! Yes, he says so. And good Sméagol does what he asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we'll see perhaps, we'll see then. It won't look nice at all. O no! O no!"</div>

<div class="line_en">In the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the marshes. They halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from Barad-dûr. After a while Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking.</div>

Gollum, however, was helpless with terror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach was known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大概在午夜之后一个小时的时候，恐惧感又再度袭来；但这次的感觉比较遥远、比较模糊，似乎它正在高空，用极高的速度扑向西方。不过，咕鲁却害怕得不得了，认为众人的行踪已经被发现，因而敌人正派出大军来猎杀他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
