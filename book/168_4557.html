<div class="line_en">Meereen was as large as Astapor and Yunkai combined. Like her sister cities she was built of brick, but where Astapor had been red and Yunkai yellow, Meereen was made with bricks of many colors. Her walls were higher than Yunkai's and in better repair, studded with bastions and anchored by great defensive towers at every angle. Behind them, huge against the sky, could be seen the top of the Great Pyramid, a monstrous thing eight hundred feet tall with a towering bronze harpy at its top.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the hero did not hide. He rode out the city gates, armored in scales of copper and jet and mounted upon a white charger whose striped pink-and-white barding matched the silk cloak flowing from the hero's shoulders. The lance he bore was fourteen feet long, swirled in pink and white, and his hair was shaped and teased and lacquered into two great curling ram's horns. Back and forth he rode beneath the walls of multicolored bricks, challenging the besiegers to send a champion forth to meet him in single combat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但护城英雄并未躲藏。他从城门里出来，身穿黄铜与黑玉的鳞甲，胯骑白色战马，马铠的颜色乃是粉白条纹，正跟英雄肩头的丝披风匹配。他擎一根十四尺粉白螺旋长枪，上油的头发打造梳理成两个巨大弯曲的羊角，在彩砖城墙下来回驰骋，发出挑战，要求攻城者派一名勇士上前跟他决一雌雄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have heard enough." Dany did not need their squabbling on top of all the other troubles that plagued her. Meereen posed dangers far more serious than one pink-and-white hero shouting insults, and she could not let herself be distracted. Her host numbered more than eighty thousand after Yunkai, but fewer than a quarter of them were soldiers. The rest… well, Ser Jorah called them mouths with feet, and soon they would be starving.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Great Masters of Meereen had withdrawn before Dany's advance, harvesting all they could and burning what they could not harvest. Scorched fields and poisoned wells had greeted her at every hand. Worst of all, they had nailed a slave child up on every milepost along the coast road from Yunkai, nailed them up still living with their entrails hanging out and one arm always outstretched to point the way to Meereen. Leading her van, Daario had given orders for the children to be taken down before Dany had to see them, but she had countermanded him as soon as she was told. "I will see them," she said. "I will see every one, and count them, and look upon their faces. And I will remember."</div>

<div class="line_en">The pink-and-white hero taunted the besiegers for an hour, mocking their manhood, mothers, wives, and gods. Meereen's defenders cheered him on from the city walls. "His name is Oznak zo Pahl," Brown Ben Plumm told her when he arrived for the war council. He was the new commander of the Second Sons, chosen by a vote of his fellow sellswords. "I was bodyguard to his uncle once, before I joined the Second Sons. The Great Masters, what a ripe lot o' maggots. The women weren't so bad, though it was worth your life to look at the wrong one the wrong way. I knew a man, Scarb, this Oznak cut his liver out. Claimed to be defending a lady's honor, he did, said Scarb had raped her with his eyes. How do you rape a wench with eyes, I ask you? But his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard, so I had to run like a rat before he killed me too."</div>

Arstan had brought his shield as well: a round steel disk no larger than a pie plate, which the eunuch grasped with his off hand rather than strapping to his forearm in the manner of Westeros. "Find liver and onions, Whitebeard," Belwas said. "Not for now, for after. Killing makes Strong Belwas hungry." He did not wait for a reply, but lumbered from the olive grove toward Oznak zo Pahl.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Strong Belwas was a slave here in the fighting pits. If this highborn Oznak should fall to such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if he wins… well, it is a poor victory for one so noble, one that Meereen can take no pride in." And unlike Ser Jorah, Daario, Brown Ben, and her three bloodriders, the eunuch did not lead troops, plan battles, or give her counsel. He does nothing but eat and boast and bellow at Arstan. Belwas was the man she could most easily spare. And it was time she learned what sort of protector Magister Illyrio had sent her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“壮汉贝沃斯曾是此地斗技场的奴隶。若出身名门的欧兹纳克败在这样一个人手上，会让伟主大人们大大蒙羞，即便得胜…对地位相差如此悬殊的他们而言，也毫无价值，弥林人不能引以为豪。”此外，跟乔拉爵士、达里奥、布朗·本和三名血盟卫不同，太监并无带领部队、拟订计划或提供谏言的能力。他除了大吃大喝、自吹自擂和冲阿斯坦吼叫，什么也不干。贝沃斯是最容易舍弃的棋子。到了掂量掂量伊利里欧总督给她派来的保护者的时候了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dust flew from the hooves of the white charger. Oznak thundered toward Strong Belwas, his striped cloak streaming from his shoulders. The whole city of Meereen seemed to be screaming him on. The besiegers' cheers seemed few and thin by comparison; her Unsullied stood in silent ranks, watching with stone faces. Belwas might have been made of stone as well. He stood in the horse's path, his vest stretched tight across his broad back. Oznak's lance was leveled at the center of his chest. its bright steel point winked in the sunlight. He's going to be impaled, she thought… as the eunuch spun sideways. And quick as the blink of an eye the horseman was beyond him, wheeling, raising the lance. Belwas made no move to strike at him. The Meereenese on the walls screamed even louder. "What is he doing?" Dany demanded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白色战马蹄间泛起尘埃，载着欧兹纳克雷鸣般地朝壮汉贝沃斯奔来，斑纹披风迎风飞舞，整个弥林城尖叫呐喊。攻城方的助威声相比之下显得稀稀落落，因为主力的无垢者们保持阵形沉默站立，跟石头一样毫无表情。贝沃斯也仿佛是块石头，硬邦邦地挡住马的前进路径，绷紧宽阔的背。欧兹纳克的长枪瞄准他胸膛中央，明亮的铁尖头在阳光下闪烁。他会被刺个透心凉，她心想…就在千钧一发之时，太监往侧面一转身，眨眼间便将骑手让过。护城英雄圈转马匹，抬起长枪，眼见贝沃斯毫无反击，城墙上的弥林人呼喊得更为响亮。“他干什么呢？”丹妮问。">查看中文翻译</div>

His great brown stomach and sagging chest were bare above the yellow silk sash knotted about his waist, and he wore no armor but his studded leather vest, so absurdly small that it did not even cover his nipples.

<div class="line_en">Oznak brought the horse around Belwas in a wide circle, then dug in with his spurs and charged again. Again Belwas waited, then spun and knocked the point of the lance aside. She could hear the eunuch's booming laughter echoing across the plain as the hero went past him. "The lance is too long," Ser Jorah said. "All Belwas needs do is avoid the point. Instead of trying to spit him so prettily, the fool should ride right over him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧兹纳克引马绕贝沃斯转了一大圈，然后猛踢马刺，再次冲锋。贝沃斯又是静静等待，关键时刻一转身，并将长枪头拨开。这回当那英雄越过时，她听见太监隆隆的笑声在原野上回荡，“这枪太长，”乔拉爵士说，“贝沃斯只需避开尖头就行。那蠢货应该直接朝他骑去，不要想潇洒地将人挑起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oznak zo Pahl charged a third time, and now Dany could see plainly that he was riding past Belwas, the way a Westerosi knight might ride at an opponent in a tilt, rather than at him, like a Dothraki riding down a foe. The flat level ground allowed the charger to get up a good speed, but it also made it easy for the eunuch to dodge the cumbersome fourteen-foot lance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧兹纳克·佐·帕尔第三次发起冲锋，丹妮清楚地看到，他是朝贝沃斯旁边而去的，好比维斯特洛骑士在长枪比武中的姿势，非如多斯拉克人那样正面撞向敌手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meereen's pink-and-white hero tried to anticipate this time, and swung his lance sideways at the last second to catch Strong Belwas when he dodged. But the eunuch had anticipated too, and this time he dropped down instead of spinning sideways. The lance passed harmlessly over his head. And suddenly Belwas was rolling, and bringing the razor-sharp arakh around in a silver arc. They heard the charger scream as the blade bit into his legs, and then the horse was falling, the hero tumbling from the saddle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="考虑到平整宽阔的地表使得战马可以提升速度，却也让太监能轻易地躲开笨重的十四尺长枪，弥林那位粉白相间的护城英雄试图预估对手的行动，在最后一刻将长枪偏向，以赶上壮汉贝沃斯的躲闪。太监早有防备，这次他向下蹲，而非转向侧面。长枪无害地从头顶掠过，贝沃斯陡地一个翻滚，锋利的亚拉克弯刀划出一道银色弧圈，砍入马腿。战马尖声嘶鸣，接着倒了下去，英雄从鞍上滚落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oznak leapt clear of his horse and managed to draw his sword before Strong Belwas was on him. Steel sang against steel, too fast and furious for Dany to follow the blows. It could not have been a dozen heartbeats before Belwas's chest was awash in blood from a slice below his breasts, and Oznak zo Pahl had an arakh planted right between his ram's horns. The eunuch wrenched the blade loose and parted the hero's head from his body with three savage blows to the neck.

His bright blue eyes. On the road from Yunkai, Daario had brought her a flower or a sprig of some plant every evening when he made his report… to help her learn the land, he said. Waspwillow, dusky roses, wild mint, lady's lace, daggerleaf, broom, prickly ben, harpy's gold… He tried to spare me the sight of the dead children too. He should not have done that, but he meant it kindly. And Daario Naharis made her laugh, which Ser Jorah never did.</div>

<div class="line_en">But these were foolish thoughts. She had a city to take, and dreaming of kisses and some sellsword's bright blue eyes would not help her breach the walls of Meereen. I am the blood of the dragon, Dany reminded herself. Her thoughts were spinning in circles, like a rat chasing its tail. Suddenly she could not stand the close confines of the pavilion another moment. I want to feel the wind on my face, and smell the sea. "Missandei," she called, "have my silver saddled.

<div class="line_en">Dany tried to imagine what it would be like if she allowed Daario to kiss her, the way Jorah had kissed her on the ship. The thought was exciting and disturbing, both at once. It is too great a risk. The Tyroshi sellsword was not a good man, no one needed to tell her that. Under the smiles and the jests he was dangerous, even cruel. Sallor and Prendahl had woken one morning as his partners; that very night he'd given her their heads. Khal Drogo could be cruel as well, and there was never a man more dangerous. She had come to love him all the same. Could I love Daario? What would it mean, if I took him into my bed? Would that make him one of the heads of the dragon? Ser Jorah would be angry, she knew, but he was the one who'd said she had to take two husbands. Perhaps I should marry them both and be done with it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The grove of burnt olive trees in which she'd raised her pavilion stood beside the sea, between the Dothraki camp and that of the Unsullied. When the horses had been saddled, Dany and her companions set out along the shoreline, away from the city. Even so, she could feel Meereen at her back, mocking her. When she looked over one shoulder, there it stood, the afternoon sun blazing off the bronze harpy atop the Great Pyramid. Inside Meereen the slavers would soon be reclining in their fringed tokars to feast on lamb and olives, unborn puppies, honeyed dormice and other such delicacies, whilst outside her children went hungry.

Another company was bathing in the sea, clad only in white linen breechclouts. The eunuchs were very clean, she had noticed. Some of her sellswords smelled as if they had not washed or changed their clothes since her father lost the Iron Throne, but the Unsullied bathed each evening, even if they'd marched all day.

<div class="line_en">The eunuchs knelt as she passed, raising clenched fists to their breasts. Dany returned the salute. The tide was coming in, and the surf foamed about the feet of her silver. She could see her ships standing out to sea. Balerion floated nearest; the great cog once known as Saduleon, her sails furled. Further out were the galleys Meraxes and Vhagar, formerly joso's Prank and Summer Sun. They were Magister Illyrio's ships, in truth, not hers at all, and yet she had given them new names with hardly a thought.

The Titan's Bastard staggered back into the surf, spitting blood and broken teeth from the ruin of his mouth. Whitebeard put Dany behind him. Mero slashed at his face. The old man jerked back, cat-quick. The staff thumped Mero's ribs, sending him reeling. Arstan splashed sideways, parried a looping cut, danced away from a second, checked a third mid-swing. The moves were so fast she could hardly follow. Missandei was pulling Dany to her feet when she heard a crack. She thought Arstan's staff had snapped until she saw the jagged bone jutting from Mero's calf. As he fell, the Titan's Bastard twisted and lunged, sending his point straight at the old man's chest. Whitebeard swept the blade aside almost contemptuously and smashed the other end of his staff against the big man's temple. Mero went sprawling, blood bubbling from his mouth as the waves washed over him.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你来这儿是为什么？”丹妮要他回答，“劳勃派你来刺杀我，又为何救我的性命？”他为篡夺者效力。他背叛了雷加的英名，他抛弃了韦赛里斯，任由哥哥在流放中自生自灭。然而假如他要我死，只需袖手旁观…“我要全部的真相，以你身为骑士的荣誉发誓，你究竟是篡夺者的人，还是我的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I saw him perhaps a dozen times… from afar most often, standing with his brothers or riding in some tourney. But every man in the Seven Kingdoms knew Barristan the Bold." He laid the point of his sword against the old man's neck. "Khaleesi, before you kneels Ser Barristan Selmy, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, who betrayed your House to serve the Usurper Robert Baratheon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我见过他十几次…大多数时候是远远看着他跟他的兄弟们站在一起，或驰骋于比武场中。七大王国里每个人都知道‘无畏的’巴利斯坦的名号。”他用剑尖抵住老人的脖子。“卡丽熙，跪在您面前的是巴利斯坦·赛尔弥爵士，御林铁卫的队长，他背叛了您的家族，为篡位者劳勃·拜拉席恩效力。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yours, if you will have me." Ser Barristan had tears in his eyes. "I took Robert's pardon, aye. I served him in Kingsguard and council. Served with the Kingslayer and others near as bad, who soiled the white cloak I wore. Nothing will excuse that. I might be serving in King's Landing still if the vile boy upon the Iron Throne had not cast me aside, it shames me to admit. But when he took the cloak that the White Bull had draped about my shoulders, and sent men to kill me that selfsame day, it was as though he'd ripped a caul off my eyes. That was when I knew I must find my true king, and die in his service --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是您的，如果您愿意接受的话。”巴利斯坦爵士眼中含着泪水。“没错，我得到劳勃的宽恕，并在御林铁卫和御前议会中为他效力，跟弑君者和其他坏蛋一起共事。他们玷污了我的白袍，没有什么可以为此开脱。若铁王座上那邪恶的男孩不剥夺我的职务，也许我仍在君临效力，承认这点让我羞愧，但确是事实。当他取下‘白牛’系于我肩的披风，并于同一天派人来杀我时，我眼中的障膜仿佛突然揭开。我意识到必须寻找真正的国王，并为他而死——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It may be that I must die a traitor's death," Ser Barristan said. "If so, I should not die alone. Before I took Robert's pardon I fought against him on the Trident. You were on the other side of that battle, Mormont, were you not?" He did not wait for an answer. "Your Grace, I am sorry I misled you. it was the only way to keep the Lannisters from learning that I had joined you. You are watched, as your brother was. Lord Varys reported every move Viserys made, for years. Whilst I sat on the small council, I heard a hundred such reports. And since the day you wed Khal Drogo, there has been an informer by your side selling your secrets, trading whispers to the Spider for gold and promises."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许必须身为叛徒而死，”巴利斯坦爵士道，“可我至少是真实的。在获得劳勃的宽恕之前，我在三叉戟河英勇作战，你却站在另一方，不是吗，莫尔蒙？”他不待回答。“陛下，很抱歉我误导了您，但这是唯一能防止兰尼斯特家知道我投效您的方法。和您哥哥从前一样，您也受到监视。多年以来，瓦里斯伯爵把韦赛里斯陛下的每一步行动都知会御前议会，我听过上百次这样的报告。而自您跟卓戈卡奥结婚以来，您身边就一直有个线人出卖您的秘密，用情报换取八爪蜘蛛的金钱和承诺。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Go, go away forever, both of you, the next time I see your faces I'll have your traitors' heads off. She could not say the words, though. They betrayed me. But they saved me. But they lied.
