<div class="line_en">He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.</div>

<div class="line_en">He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible… All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort's chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken him… or had that been the pain in his scar?</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion, the best sport in the world -- couldn't distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利走过去，把书捡起来，注视着一个巫师把球投进五十英尺高的圆环，十分漂亮地赢得一分。随即，哈利又猛地把书合上了。魁地奇比赛，在哈利看来，是世界上最精彩的运动，可是此刻也不能吸引他的注意力了。他把那本叫《和火炮队一起飞翔》的书放在床头柜上，走到窗前，拉开窗帘，望着下面的街道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把脸从手上抬起来，睁开眼睛，使劲盯着卧室四周，好像以为会看见什么不寻常的东西。确实，房间里有满满当当一大堆不寻常的东西。在他的床脚旁有一个大木箱子，敞开着，露出里面的坩埚、飞天扫帚、黑袍子和各种各样的咒语书，那是哈利昨晚临睡前看的。这本书上的图画都在动个不停，穿着鲜艳的橙红色袍子的小伙子骑在飞天扫帚上，嗖嗖地飞来飞去，相互掷着一个红色的球。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet… and yet… Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn't the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced by a venemous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而…然而…哈利心神不宁地回到床边，坐了下来，又伸出一根手指抚摸着他的伤疤。令他烦恼的不是伤疤的疼痛，哈利对疼痛和受伤已经习以为常。有一次，他右臂里所有的骨头都没有了，可又在一夜之间全部长好了，那真是钻心的疼埃在这之后不久，还是这条胳膊，又被一只尺把长的毒牙刺伤。就在去年，哈利飞到五十英尺高的空中时，还从飞行着的扫帚上坠落下来。对他来说，稀奇古怪的事故和伤痛已经是家常便饭。既然你进了霍格沃茨魔法学校，并且擅长招惹是非，就绝对无法避免这些事故和伤痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn't a living creature in sight, not even a cat.</div>

<div class="line_en">No, the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by… But Voldemort couldn't be here, now… The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible…</div>

<div class="line_en">Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn't as though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were Harry's only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. They had explained away Harry's long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利最喜欢的就是德思礼一家睡着的时候。这并不是说他们会对醒着的他有什么帮助。弗农姨父、佩妮姨妈和达力是哈利惟一在世的亲戚。他们都是麻瓜，憎恨和蔑视任何形式的魔法，这就意味着哈利在他们家像霉菌一样不受欢迎。过去的三年里，哈利到霍格沃茨上学，长期不在家，他们为了消除别人的疑虑，总是解释说哈利去了专门关押不可救药少年犯的圣布鲁斯管教所。他们明明知道，哈利作为一个未成年巫师，是不允许在霍格沃茨以外的地方使用魔法的，可每当家里出了什么乱子，他们还总把责任推到他身上。哈利从来没法对他们说说知心话，也不能告诉他们他在魔法世界里生活的详细情况。想一想，等他们醒了，他去对他们说他的伤疤疼痛发作，并说他担心伏地魔潜伏在附近，这岂不太可笑了吗！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort -- the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort's followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利刚刚一岁的时候，有一天夜里，伏地魔——这个一百年来最强大的黑巫师，这个花费十一年的时间扩展其势力范围的大巫师，闯到哈利家里，杀死了哈利的爸爸妈妈。然后，伏地魔把他的魔杖指向哈利，念了一个咒语——在伏地魔的力量不断发展壮大的过程中，这个咒语曾将许多成年男女巫师置于死地，然而那天夜里，它却莫名其妙地失灵了。咒语并没有结果小男孩的性命，而是反弹到伏地魔身上。哈利安然无恙，只是额头上留下了一道闪电形的伤疤，而伏地魔却沦为一种半死不活的状态。他的魔法全废了，生命奄奄一息。伏地魔逃跑了，长久以来笼罩着神秘魔法世界的恐惧消除了，伏地魔的追随者们作鸟兽散，哈利·波特一夜之间名闻遐迩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, that would be Hermione's advice: Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，赫敏肯定会这样建议：赶紧去找霍格沃茨的校长，同时在一本书里查找答案。哈利凝望着窗外沉甸甸的深蓝色夜空。现在书本能够给他帮助吗？他感到怀疑。据他所知，经历了伏地魔那样的咒语而活下来的只有他一个人。因此，他不可能看到他的症状列举在《常见魔法病痛》里。那么要不要告诉校长呢？可是哈利压根儿就不知道邓布利多暑假去了哪里。哈利津津有味的幻想着有着一把银白胡子的邓布利多：穿着长长的巫师袍，戴着尖顶帽，正躺在什么地方的海滩上，往自己长长的鹰钩鼻子上抹防晒油。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn't have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew.

Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron's sixteen-year -- old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利从床上一跃而起，匆匆走过屋子，在桌子旁坐下。他拉过一张羊皮纸，将鹰毛羽管笔蘸满墨水，写下“亲爱的小天狼星”，然后停住了。他不知道用什么词语表达自己面临的问题，一边脑海里还在惊叹，刚才怎么没有一下子就想到小天狼星呢，接着他想通了——毕竟，他是在两个月前才发现小天狼星是他的教父埃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a simple reason for Sirius's complete absence from Harry's life until then -- Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent -- the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort's supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，为什么在那之前小天狼星没有在哈利的生活中出现呢，原因非常简单——小天狼星被关在阿兹卡班，那座令人恐怖的巫师监狱，看守是一些被称为摄魂怪的家伙。它们没有视力，是专门摄取别人灵魂的魔鬼。小天狼星逃跑后，它们曾到霍格沃茨来搜找过他。其实小天狼星是无辜的——指控他犯的那些谋杀罪行，实际上真正的凶手是伏地魔的追随者虫尾巴，而几乎每个人都以为虫尾巴已经死了。不过，哈利、罗恩和赫敏知道他还活着。就在去年，他们还和虫尾巴面对面地接触过，可是只有邓布利多教授才相信他们的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away from him -- Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，在那一个钟头里哈利真是心花怒放，他以为自己终于要离开德思礼家了，因为等到小天狼星澄清自己的名誉，他就要给哈利一个家。然而，这个机会被剥夺了——还没等他们把虫尾巴带到魔法部，就让他逃脱了，小天狼星不得不匆匆逃命。哈利帮助他骑上那头名叫巴克比克的鹰头马身有翼兽逃走了，从那以后，小天狼星就一直逃亡在外。如果虫尾巴没有逃脱，哈利将有一个多么好的家埃整个夏天，这个念头一直萦绕着他。哈利明知道自己差一点儿就可以永远摆脱德思礼一家了，现在却又不得不回到他们身边，那种滋味真是难受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn't be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather -- for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，小天狼星虽然不可能陪伴哈利，却一直在帮助他。正是因为有了小天狼星，哈利现在才能把学校里用的东西都放在卧室里。以前德思礼一家是绝对不许他这么做的。他们一门心思不让哈利快活，再加上对他的功力十分害怕，所以在此之前的每年夏天，他们都把他上学用的东西锁在楼下的碗橱里。后来，当他们发现哈利有一个危险的杀人犯当他的教父时，他们的态度就转变了——哈利恰好忘记告诉他们小天狼星是无辜的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当黎明前寒冷的、灰白色的天光慢慢透进房间时，哈利的台灯光线似乎变暗了。终于，太阳升起来了，卧室的墙壁被映成了金黄色，弗农姨父和佩妮姨妈的房间里也有了动静。这时，哈利收拾起桌上那些揉皱的羊皮纸团，又把那封终于写成的信读了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South. Sirius's letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under Harry's bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to right now, all right…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利回到女贞路后，收到过小天狼星的两封信。这两封信不是猫头鹰送来的（用猫头鹰送信是巫师们的惯常做法），它们都是色彩斑斓的热带大鸟送来的。海德薇对这些花里胡哨的入侵者很不以为然，它甚至不愿意让它们在它的水盘里喝几口水再动身离开。哈利倒是很喜欢那些热带鸟，它们使他想起棕榈树和白色的沙滩。他衷心希望，小天狼星不管在哪里，都生活得很愉快。由于担心信件被半道截走，小天狼星从不透露自己的去向。不知怎的，哈利觉得很难想象摄魂怪能在灿烂的阳光下存活很长时间，也许正是考虑到这一点，小天狼星才到南方去了。此刻，小天狼星的信就藏在哈利床底下那块松动的地板下——这块地板的用处非常大。信上的口气很愉快，两封信都提醒哈利，如果他需要的话，随时可以召唤小天狼星。瞧，哈利现在就有这种需要了，好吧…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dear Sirius, Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet isn't going too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That's a sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off things.</div>

<div class="line_en">Say hello to Buckbeak for me. Harry Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the dream; he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.</div>
