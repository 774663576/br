<div class="line_en">One day Tereza came to him uninvited. One day she left the same way. She came with a heavy suitcase. She left with a heavy suitcase.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went to a restaurant for lunch. He was depressed, but as he ate, his original desperation waned, lost its strength, and soon all that was left was melancholy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他去饭店吃午饭。他感到很伤心，但吃着吃着，原本绝望的情绪好像放松了，仿佛绝望已经淡去，只剩下几许忧郁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He paid the bill, left the restaurant, and started walking through the streets, his melancholy growing more and more beautiful. He had spent seven years of life with Tereza, and now he realized that those years were more attractive in retrospect than they were when he was living them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他付了账，走出饭店，想在街上逛逛，满怀的忧郁渐渐地令他心醉。他同特蕾莎已经生活了七个春秋，此刻他才发现，对这些岁月的回忆远比他们在一起生活时更加美好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The realization that he was utterly powerless was like the blow of a sledgehammer, yet it was curiously calming as well. No one was forcing him into a decision. He felt no need to stare at the walls of the houses across the courtyard and ponder whether to live with her or not. Tereza had made the decision herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一想到自己已经绝对无能为力，他便陷入了一种惊恐状态，但同时反倒镇静下来。没有人逼他非作出决定不可。他用不着非盯着对面楼房的墙，一边追问自己到底想或不想与她生活在一起。这一切，特蕾莎本人已经决定了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Saturday found him for the first time strolling alone through Zurich, breathing in the heady smell of his freedom. New adventures hid around each corner. The future was again a secret. He was on his way back to the bachelor life, the life he had once felt destined for, the life that would let him be what he actually was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期六的夜晚开始了；他第一次独自在苏黎世漫步，深深地呼吸着自由的芬芳。在每个角落，都潜藏着诱惑。未来成了一个谜。他又回到了单身汉的生活，他曾坚信自己命中注定要过这种生活，因为只有在这样的生活中他才真正是他自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For seven years he had lived bound to her, his every step subject to her scrutiny. She might as well have chained iron balls to his ankles. Suddenly his step was much lighter. He soared. He had entered Parmenides' magic field: he was enjoying the sweet lightness of being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他跟特蕾莎捆在一起生活了七年，七年里，他每走一步，她都在盯着。仿佛她在他的脚踝上套了铁球。现在，他的脚步突然间变得轻盈了许多。他几乎都要飞起来了。此时此刻，他置身于巴门尼德的神奇空间：他在品尝着温馨的生命之轻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(Did he feel like phoning Sabina in Geneva? Contacting one or another of the women he had met during his several months in Zurich? No, not in the least. Perhaps he sensed that any woman would make his memory of Tereza unbearably painful.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（他是否想给住在日内瓦的萨比娜打电话？是否想跟近几个月在苏黎世结识的某个女人联系？不，他丝毫没有这份欲望。一旦他同别的女人在一起，他非常清楚，对特蕾莎的怀念会给他造成无法承受的痛苦。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His love for Tereza was beautiful, but it was also tiring: he had constantly had to hide things from her, sham, dissemble, make amends, buck her up, calm her down, give her evidence of his feelings, play the defendant to her jealousy, her suffering, and her dreams, feel guilty, make excuses and apologies. Now what was tiring had disappeared and only the beauty remained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和特蕾莎之间的爱情无疑是美好的，但也很累人：总要瞒着什么，又是隐藏，又是假装，还得讲和，让她振作，给她安慰，翻来覆去地向她证明他爱她，还要忍受因为嫉妒、痛苦、做噩梦而产生的满腹怨艾，总之，他总感到自己有罪，得为自己开脱，请对方原谅。现在，再也不用受累了，剩下的只有美好。">查看中文翻译</div>
