<div class="line_en">He was entirely puzzled, but fortunately at that moment the omelette came. He divided it in two and they began to eat. Philip did his best to talk of indifferent things, and it seemed as though Miss Price were making an effort on her side to be agreeable; but the luncheon was not altogether a success. Philip was squeamish, and the way in which Miss Price ate took his appetite away. She ate noisily, greedily, a little like a wild beast in a menagerie, and after she had finished each course rubbed the plate with pieces of bread till it was white and shining, as if she did not wish to lose a single drop of gravy. They had Camembert cheese, and it disgusted Philip to see that she ate rind and all of the portion that was given her. She could not have eaten more ravenously if she were starving.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Price was unaccountable, and having parted from her on one day with friendliness he could never tell whether on the next she would not be sulky and uncivil; but he learned a good deal from her: though she could not draw well herself, she knew all that could be taught, and her constant suggestions helped his progress. Mrs. Otter was useful to him too, and sometimes Miss Chalice criticised his work; he learned from the glib loquacity of Lawson and from the example of Clutton. But Fanny Price hated him to take suggestions from anyone but herself, and when he asked her help after someone else had been talking to him she would refuse with brutal rudeness. The other fellows, Lawson, Clutton, Flanagan, chaffed him about her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="普里斯小姐的脾气让人难以捉摸。前天晚上可能还友善地和你告别，第二天说不定就对你横鼻子竖眼了。但是菲利普的确从她身上学到了不少知识。虽然她自己画得不怎么好，教导起别人来却头头是道。他从她的谆谆教导中进步了不少。奥特夫人也没少帮他，有时查理斯小姐也会指导一下他的画。除此之外，劳森的絮絮叨叨和克拉顿的画作里也有不少能汲取的营养。范宁·普里斯看到菲利普从其他人那里听取建议心里很是不悦。有时候如果菲利普刚和别人说完话，又来问普里斯的意见，那迎接他的一定是闭门羹。劳森、克拉顿、弗拉纳根都拿他俩起哄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thought that Miss Price could be in love with anyone was preposterous. It made him shudder when he thought of her uncomeliness, the bedraggled hair and the dirty hands, the brown dress she always wore, stained and ragged at the hem: he supposed she was hard up, they were all hard up, but she might at least be clean; and it was surely possible with a needle and thread to make her skirt tidy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip began to sort his impressions of the people he was thrown in contact with. He was not so ingenuous as in those days which now seemed so long ago at Heidelberg, and, beginning to take a more deliberate interest in humanity, he was inclined to examine and to criticise. He found it difficult to know Clutton any better after seeing him every day for three months than on the first day of their acquaintance. The general impression at the studio was that he was able; it was supposed that he would do great things, and he shared the general opinion; but what exactly he was going to do neither he nor anybody else quite knew. He had worked at several studios before Amitrano's, at Julian's, the Beaux Arts, and MacPherson's, and was remaining longer at Amitrano's than anywhere because he found himself more left alone. He was not fond of showing his work, and unlike most of the young men who were studying art neither sought nor gave advice. It was said that in the little studio in the Rue Campagne Premiere, which served him for work-room and bed-room, he had wonderful pictures which would make his reputation if only he could be induced to exhibit them. He could not afford a model but painted still life, and Lawson constantly talked of a plate of apples which he declared was a masterpiece. He was fastidious, and, aiming at something he did not quite fully grasp, was constantly dissatisfied with his work as a whole: perhaps a part would please him, the forearm or the leg and foot of a figure, a glass or a cup in a still-life; and he would cut this out and keep it, destroying the rest of the canvas; so that when people invited themselves to see his work he could truthfully answer that he had not a single picture to show. In Brittany he had come across a painter whom nobody else had heard of, a queer fellow who had been a stockbroker and taken up painting at middle-age, and he was greatly influenced by his work. He was turning his back on the impressionists and working out for himself painfully an individual way not only of painting but of seeing. Philip felt in him something strangely original.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普开始把他这段时间认识的人根据印象整理分类。在海德堡的那股天真劲儿现在已经一去不返，他开始关注起人品，喜欢把各人的特性拿出来琢磨、评价一番。克拉顿这个人嘛，尽管已经相处了三个月，但是对他的认识却并不比第一天见他的时候多。画室的人普遍觉得他挺有能力，应该能成大事，他自己也是这么想的。但所谓“大事”到底是什么事，他和其他人一样，心里没数。来阿米特拉纳之前他也曾在其他画室待过，什么朱利安画室、博扎美术学校、麦克佛森画室，等等。他在这里待的时间最长，因为这儿没人会打扰他。他不喜欢把自己的画拿出来展示，也不像其他学艺术的年轻人一样总是到处询问别人意见，或者对其他人指指点点。据说他曾经吃住、工作都在首战路的一个小画室里，在那画出了不少好作品。要是当时他愿意拿出来办展览，肯定会因此功成名就。他雇不起模特，只能画些静物。劳森总是提起克拉顿画过的一盘苹果，他断言这是一幅杰作。克拉顿为人挑剔，一味地想达到某些连自己都无从理解的目标。他常觉得自己的一整幅画不尽人意：也许整张画里只有一个部分能让他满意，比如一幅人像的前臂或者一条腿、一只脚；再或者是静态景物里的某个水杯、茶盏之类。他把满意的地方剪下来留着，剩下全部销毁。所以有人想看看他作品的时候，他总是实事求是地说自己没什么能拿出来展示。他在布列塔尼认识了个名不见经传的画家，这个奇怪的人之前是个证券商，人到中年才开始捡起画笔。他的画作对克拉顿影响很深。他开始反对印象主义，兢兢业业地试图拓出一条独一无二的绘画道路，一种独特的观察万事万物的方式。菲利普觉得他确实非比寻常。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At Gravier's where they ate, and in the evening at the Versailles or at the Closerie des Lilas Clutton was inclined to taciturnity. He sat quietly, with a sardonic expression on his gaunt face, and spoke only when the opportunity occurred to throw in a witticism. He liked a butt and was most cheerful when someone was there on whom he could exercise his sarcasm. He seldom talked of anything but painting, and then only with the one or two persons whom he thought worth while. Philip wondered whether there was in him really anything: his reticence, the haggard look of him, the pungent humour, seemed to suggest personality, but might be no more than an effective mask which covered nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在格拉维尔餐厅的桌子旁用餐，或者晚上在凡尔赛或者丁香园咖啡馆小坐，这些时候，克拉顿总是寡言少语。他静静地坐着，干瘦的脸上挂着嘲讽的表情，只有在有机会插科打诨的情况下才偶尔开一下金口。要是有人能让他冷嘲热讽一番，他就会乐得手舞足蹈。除了绘画他基本不会谈论其他内容，只有两三个人让他感觉值得一聊。菲利普不知道克拉顿肚子里到底有几滴墨水：他的沉默寡言、没精打采的神色和辛辣的幽默似乎都暗示了他的个性。可也许这都只是掩饰自己不学无术的假面罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With Lawson on the other hand Philip soon grew intimate. He had a variety of interests which made him an agreeable companion. He read more than most of the students and though his income was small, loved to buy books. He lent them willingly; and Philip became acquainted with Flaubert and Balzac, with Verlaine, Heredia, and Villiers de l'Isle Adam. They went to plays together and sometimes to the gallery of the Opera Comique. There was the Odeon quite near them, and Philip soon shared his friend's passion for the tragedians of Louis XIV and the sonorous Alexandrine. In the Rue Taitbout were the Concerts Rouge, where for seventy-five centimes they could hear excellent music and get into the bargain something which it was quite possible to drink: the seats were uncomfortable, the place was crowded, the air thick with caporal horrible to breathe, but in their young enthusiasm they were indifferent. Sometimes they went to the Bal Bullier. On these occasions Flanagan accompanied them. His excitability and his roisterous enthusiasm made them laugh. He was an excellent dancer, and before they had been ten minutes in the room he was prancing round with some little shop-girl whose acquaintance he had just made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一方面，菲利普和劳森一天天熟络起来。劳森这人有千奇百怪的兴趣，和他做朋友永远不会觉得无聊。他比大多数学生读的书都多，尽管手头拮据、薪水微薄，但并不影响他买书的喜好。他还很乐意把书借给别人，菲利普因此拜读了福楼拜和巴尔扎克的小说，以及魏尔伦、埃雷迪亚和利尔亚当的诗。他们一起去看戏，有时还一起买张顶层的便宜票欣赏歌剧。他们的住处旁就是奥代翁剧院。菲利普受劳森影响喜欢上了路易十四时期的悲剧作品和字正腔圆、声音洪亮的亚历山大诗歌朗诵。在泰布街的红色音乐会上，花七十五生丁就能欣赏到美妙的音乐，好好讲价的话还能喝到饮品。尽管椅子不舒服，地方也挤，空气里弥漫着刺鼻的烟草味，让人喘不了气，但年轻的菲利普和劳森对这一切都毫不介意。他们有时还去布利埃舞厅，一般弗拉纳根也会结伴同行。一到舞厅里，弗拉纳根那副猴急的样儿和推杯换盏的耍酒疯惹得其他人哈哈大笑。弗拉纳根舞跳得很好，到舞厅还不出十分钟就牵着刚刚认识的女孩满场转圈了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The desire of all of them was to have a mistress. It was part of the paraphernalia of the art-student in Paris. It gave consideration in the eyes of one's fellows. It was something to boast about. But the difficulty was that they had scarcely enough money to keep themselves, and though they argued that French-women were so clever it cost no more to keep two then one, they found it difficult to meet young women who were willing to take that view of the circumstances. They had to content themselves for the most part with envying and abusing the ladies who received protection from painters of more settled respectability than their own. It was extraordinary how difficult these things were in Paris. Lawson would become acquainted with some young thing and make an appointment; for twenty-four hours he would be all in a flutter and describe the charmer at length to everyone he met; but she never by any chance turned up at the time fixed. He would come to Gravier's very late, ill-tempered, and exclaim:</div>

<div class="line_en">It was more than a year now since he had seen Miss Wilkinson, and during his first weeks in Paris he had been too busy to answer a letter she had written to him just before he left Blackstable. When another came, knowing it would be full of reproaches and not being just then in the mood for them, he put it aside, intending to open it later; but he forgot and did not run across it till a month afterwards, when he was turning out a drawer to find some socks that had no holes in them. He looked at the unopened letter with dismay. He was afraid that Miss Wilkinson had suffered a good deal, and it made him feel a brute; but she had probably got over the suffering by now, at all events the worst of it. It suggested itself to him that women were often very emphatic in their expressions. These did not mean so much as when men used them. He had quite made up his mind that nothing would induce him ever to see her again. He had not written for so long that it seemed hardly worth while to write now. He made up his mind not to read the letter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他有一年多没见过威尔金森小姐了。刚离开布莱克斯塔布尔时，威尔金森小姐给他写过几封信。但是初到巴黎的几个星期里他都太忙了，迟迟没有回复。后来又收到一封，但不用打开就知道里面肯定写满了对自己的埋怨。他当时正好没有心情，就先把信搁到一边儿，想过一阵子再看。后来，也就慢慢忘了还有这出没解决的事。一个月后，他翻抽屉想找双没破洞的袜子，忽然看到了这封信。这枚还没拆开的信封让他心里一下着了慌。万一威尔金森小姐前阵子过得很糟而自己却不闻不问，那就显得他未免太薄情寡义了些。但也许现在情况已经有所好转，至少最难过的时候也熬了过来。就他而言，女人都有夸大言辞的毛病。同样的话，女人可以随便说出口，但男人就要斟酌再三。他决定不管发生什么诱惑自己的事，都坚决不再见威尔金森小姐了。他已经太久没有动笔写信了，现在似乎也不值得为此大费周章，所以，直到最后他还是没有打开这封信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For an hour or two he felt a little uncomfortable. His attitude was obviously the right one, but he could not help a feeling of dissatisfaction with the whole business. Miss Wilkinson, however, did not write again; nor did she, as he absurdly feared, suddenly appear in Paris to make him ridiculous before his friends. In a little while he clean forgot her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一两个小时后，他又开始觉得忐忑不安。虽然心里没有动摇，却不免觉得这一整件事都不尽人意。然而，威尔金森小姐真的再没写过信给他。起先，他害怕这个女人忽然出现在巴黎，跑到他朋友面前大闹一场，让他下不来台。但没过多久，他就把这件事彻彻底底抛到脑后了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile he definitely forsook his old gods. The amazement with which at first he had looked upon the works of the impressionists, changed to admiration; and presently he found himself talking as emphatically as the rest on the merits of Manet, Monet, and Degas. He bought a photograph of a drawing by Ingres of the Odalisque and a photograph of the Olympia. They were pinned side by side over his washing-stand so that he could contemplate their beauty while he shaved. He knew now quite positively that there had been no painting of landscape before Monet; and he felt a real thrill when he stood in front of Rembrandt's Disciples at Emmaus or Velasquez' Lady with the Flea-bitten Nose. That was not her real name, but by that she was distinguished at Gravier's to emphasise the picture's beauty notwithstanding the somewhat revolting peculiarity of the sitter's appearance. With Ruskin, Burne-Jones, and Watts, he had put aside his bowler hat and the neat blue tie with white spots which he had worn on coming to Paris; and now disported himself in a soft, broad-brimmed hat, a flowing black cravat, and a cape of romantic cut. He walked along the Boulevard du Montparnasse as though he had known it all his life, and by virtuous perseverance he had learnt to drink absinthe without distaste. He was letting his hair grow, and it was only because Nature is unkind and has no regard for the immortal longings of youth that he did not attempt a beard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也大概就是在这时，菲利普态度明确地抛弃了自己往日的偶像。起先他对印象主义画家的作品只是叹为观止，但现在已经演化成崇敬之情。他发现自己也开始像其他人一样啧啧称赞马奈、莫奈和德加等人的成就。他买了两张画作的图片：安格尔的《大宫女》和马奈的《奥林匹亚》，把这两张画并排钉在自己的洗手架旁，这样刮胡子的时候就可以好好欣赏一番了。他现在深信在莫奈之前从没有人画过真正的风景画；站在伦勃朗的《以马忤斯的晚餐》和委拉斯凯兹的《被跳蚤咬了鼻子的女人》前，他身上会像过电一般战栗不止。“被跳蚤咬了鼻子”显然不是这个女人的姓名，但是在格拉维尔餐厅人们谈到这幅画的时候都会这样称呼她。尽管画中人的容貌令人不想多看，但是这幅画作的艺术造诣还是得到了大家的一致赞叹。他已经和罗斯金、伯恩·琼斯和沃茨这些人的理论划清了界限，随之一起被打入冷宫的还有他来巴黎时戴着的圆顶礼帽和干净的蓝底白点领带。现在的他会戴柔软的宽边帽，围一条飘逸的黑色围巾，再披件颇有风度的披风外套。他沿着蒙帕纳斯街信步而行，好像从小就在这儿长大。经过不断尝试之后，他现在也能喝苦艾酒了，觉得那股苦味儿还算挺爽口。他的头发越来越长，要不是因为造物主不讲情面，对古往今来年轻人的愿望不予理睬的话，到现在他也早就蓄起胡子来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I daresay she won't write again," he said to himself. "She can't help seeing the thing's over. After all, she was old enough to be my mother; she ought to have known better."</div>
