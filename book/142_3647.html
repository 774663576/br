<div class="line_en">It was nearly four o'clock in the morning as they all sat in the corner room office -- Sonny, Michael, Tom Hagen, Clemenza and Tessio. Theresa Hagen had been persuaded to go to her own home next door. Paulie Gatto was still waiting in the living room, not knowing that Tessio's men had been instructed not to let him leave or let him out of their sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨，快到四点钟的时候，他们还坐在楼角大房间办公室里。他们是：桑儿、迈克尔、汤姆·黑根、克莱门扎、忒希奥。鲍里·嘎吐还在起居室等待着。他还蒙在鼓里，根本不知道忒希奥手下的人已经受命不许他离开，也不许他乱窜到他们看不到的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom Hagen relayed the deal Sollozzo offered. He told how after Sollozzo had learned the Don still lived, it was obvious that he meant to kill Hagen. Hagen grinned. "If I ever plead before the Supreme Court, I'll never plead better than I did with that goddamn Turk tonight. I told him I'd talk the Family into the deal even though the Don was alive. I told him I could wrap you around my finger, Sonny. How we were buddies as kids; and don't get sore, but I let him get the idea that maybe you weren't too sorry about getting the old man's job, God forgive me." He smiled apologetically at Sonny, who made a gesture signifying that he understood, that it was of no consequence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆·黑根如实转达了索洛佐提出的交易方案。他还说，索洛佐在得知老头子还活着后，显然想杀掉他。黑根咧嘴一笑，又说：“如果我向最高法院上诉，效果也绝不会比我今天晚上就向这个该死的“土耳其人”上诉的效果好。我对他说，即使老头子还活着，我也可以说服考利昂家族接受这个交易方案。桑儿啊，我告诉他说，我可以把你攒在我的手心里，还说我俩从小就是好朋友什么的。你别见怪，我故意让他产生一种错觉：要是你早点接替你老子的职务，你也并不感到太遗憾。我当时说的这些话，请求上帝宽恕我。”说罢，他面带笑容，抱歉地望着桑儿；桑儿把手一摆，表示他懂得这类话是不算数的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let's get down to business," Sonny said. "We have to make plans. Take a look at this list me and Tessio made up. Tessio, give Clemenza your copy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们还是谈正事吧，”桑儿说。“咱们得订些计划。首先看看我同忒希奥拟订的这份名单。忒希奥，你就把你那一份交给克莱门扎看看。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael, leaning back in his armchair with the phone at his right hand, studied both men. When Hagen had entered the room Sonny had come rushing to embrace him. Michael realized with a faint twinge of jealousy that in many ways Sonny and Tom Hagen were closer than he himself could ever be to his own brother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔背靠在扶手椅上，电话就在右边放着，心里在思量着这两个人：黑根一走进屋子，桑儿就冲过去拥抱他。迈克尔感到了一阵嫉妒的刺痛：他发现在很多方面，桑儿同汤姆·黑根这一对朋友之间的感情要比他与桑儿的感情更亲密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny said grimly, "Freddie is no use to us. The doctor says he's in shock so bad he has to have complete rest. I don't understand that. Freddie was always a pretty tough guy. I guess seeing the old man gunned down was hard on him, he always thought the Don was God. He wasn't like you and me, Mike."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿板起面孔说：“弗烈特眼下帮不了咱们的忙。医生说他严重休克，非休息不可。这我不理解，弗烈特这小子平常一直很顽强。我想，这次可能是亲眼看到咱老子给打倒，精神上受刺激。他一向认为老头子就是上帝。迈克，他那个人同你我都不一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen said quickly, "OK, leave Freddie out. Leave him out of everything, absolutely everything. Now, Sonny, until this is all over I think you should stay in the house. I mean sever leave it. You're safe here. Don't underrate Sollozzo, he's got to be a pezzonovante, a real.90 caliber. Is the hospital covered?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根马上接过来说：“对，别让弗烈特参与，别让他参与任何活动。桑儿，我认为，在这场风波完全过去之前，你该待在这栋房子里。我的意思是说，你绝对不要离开这栋房子。你在这儿才安全，不可低估索洛佐。他是个大亨，是个外口径九十公分的真正的大炮。医院有人警卫吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”桑儿说，“我一个晚上都在给他打电话，也许他到外面跟姘头过夜去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny nodded. "The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time. What do you think of that list, Tom?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿点了点头。“警察已经把医院封锁了。汤姆，你看这份名单怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny said to Clemenza, "One thing we can take care of without discussion. I don't want Paulie around here anymore. Make that first on your list." The fat caporegime nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿对克莱门扎说：“有一件事咱们用不着讨论就可以干。我不想要鲍里再待下去了，把他摆在你那份名单的首位。”大胖子司令点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen frowned down at the fist of names: "Jesus Christ, Sonny, you're really taking this personal. The Don would consider it a purely business dispute. Sollozzo is the key. Get rid of Sollozzo and everything falls in line. You don't have to go after the Tattaglias."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根皱起眉头，瞅着那份名单。“耶稣基督啊，桑儿，看来你在这个问题上是真的动了个人感情。老头子会认为这是纯粹的生意纠纷。索洛佐是个关键人物，只要搞掉索洛佐，一切问题都会迎刃而解。你用不着揪住塔塔格里亚一家不放。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Hagen said. "He never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through. Mike, keep ringing his number until you get an answer." Michael dutifully picked up the phone and dialed. He could hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answered. Finally he hung up. "Keep trying every fifteen minutes," Hagen said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会，”黑根说，“他绝对不跟下流女人在外面过夜。他向来是一干完就回家的。迈克，你不妨反复拨他的电话号码，听不到回答再拨。迈克尔顺从地抓起电话，拨了起来。他明明听到那边电话铃在响，但就是没有人接。最后，他只好把电话挂上。“每隔十五分钟试拨一次，”黑根说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny looked at his two caporegimes. Tessio shrugged. "It's tricky," he said. Clemenza didn't answer at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿瞅了瞅他的两个兵团司令。忒希奥耸耸肩。“这问题很棘手，”他说。克莱门扎默不作声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen said, "What about Luca? Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca. That worries me. If Luca sold us out, we're in real trouble. That's the first thing we have to know. Has anybody been able to get in touch with him?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen helped himself to the whiskey bottle on the desk. "We negotiate with Sollozzo until your father is in shape to take charge. We might even make a deal if we have to. When your father gets out of bed he can settle the whole business without a fuss and all the Families will go along with him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根抓起桌子上的威士忌酒瓶，自斟自酌起来。“我们不妨跟索洛佐谈判，策略是拖，一直拖到你爸爸恢复健康，重返工作岗位为止。必要时我们甚至可以做点交易。等你爸爸下了床，他就可以左右全局，不费吹灰之力，所有的大家族都会跟着他的屁股转。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny said angrily, "You think I can't handle this guy Sollozzo?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿勃然大怒：“莫非你认定我没有能力对付索洛佐这小子？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom Hagen looked him directly in the eye. "Sonny, sure you can outfight him. The Corleone Family has the power. You have Clemenza and Tessio here and they can muster a thousand men if it comes to an all-out war. But at the end there will be a shambles over the whole East Coast and all the other Families will blame the Corleones. We'll make a lot of enemies. And that's something your father never believed in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根直瞅着他的眼睛。“桑儿啊，肯定你有能力赢他，考利昂家族有这样的力量。你有克莱门扎和忒希奥这两员干将。如果来一场战争，他们两个一声令下，能集合上千人。但是，到头来，整个东海岸将变成大屠宰场，别的大家族都会责怪考利昂一家，我们就到处树敌。这是你爸爸绝对忌讳的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny said impatiently, "OK, Tom you're the Consigliere, how about some advice? What the hell do you think we should do?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael, watching Sonny, thought he took this well. But then Sonny said to Hagen, "What if the old man dies, what do you advise then, Consigliere?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔两眼瞅着桑儿，满以为他把这些话听进去了。不料，桑儿竟对黑根反问道：“请问参谋，如果我老子死掉了，怎么办？那你能参谋些什么哪？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen said quickly and proudly, "I was as good a son to him as you or Mike, maybe better. I'm giving you a professional opinion. Personally I want to kill all those bastards." The emotion in his voice shamed Sonny, who said, "Oh, Christ, Tom, I didn't mean it that way." But he had, really. Blood was blood and nothing else was its equal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根很自豪而爽快地说：“与你或迈克尔相比，我同样是他的好儿子，或许是更好的儿子。这是我从参谋的角度给你提的意见。要从个人感情出发的话，那我恨不得把那些王八羔子统统干掉。”他话音里流露出来的感情，使桑儿感到难为情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen said quietly, "I know you won't do it, but I would advise you to make a real deal with Sollozzo on the drugs. Without your father's political contacts and personal influence the Corleone Family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York Families might wind up supporting the Tattaglias and Sollozzo just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. If your father dies, make the deal. Then wait and see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根心平气和地说：“我明知道你不会听，但是我还是想劝劝你，在毒品问题上应该同索洛佐做一笔真正的交易。一旦失去了你爸爸在政界的后门和他本人的威望，考利昂家族的力量必然要损失一半。假如没有了你爸爸，纽约其他大家族必将加紧支持塔塔格里亚家族和索洛佐，目的是为了防止这场战争。总之，假如你爸爸死掉了，那你先做这笔交易，然后，等着瞧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny brooded for a moment as the others waited in embarrassed silence. Then he sighed and spoke quietly. "OK, we'll sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But, Tom, I want you to stay inside the mall, too. Don't take any chances. Mike, you be careful, though I don't think. even Sollozzo would bring personal family into the war. Everybody would be against him then. But be careful. Tessio, you hold your people in reserve but have them nosing around the city. Clemenza, after you settle the Paulie Gatto thing, you move your men into the house and the mall to replace Tessio's people. Tessio, you keep your men at the hospital, though. Tom, start negotiation over the phone or by messenger with Sollozzo and the Tattaglias the first thing in the morning. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's house and wait for him to show up or find out where the hell he is. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news. I can't believe he'd ever go against his Don, no matter what the Turk offered him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿说：“哦，耶稣基督，汤姆，我原来不是那个意思。”但是他就是这个意思，亲不亲，一家人，外人究竟是外人。当大家都在沉默中左右为难的时候，桑儿叹了口气，不慌不忙地说：“好吧，那咱们就坐着别动，等到老头子可以对我们发号施令的时候再说。不过，汤姆啊，我想你也应待在林荫道的范围之内。不要存侥幸心。迈克，你可得小心点啊，虽然我认为甚至像索洛佐这样的亡命之徒也不会把私人拖进战争的漩涡，但是，还得小心。忒希奥，可以把你的人作为后备军，让他们在市内到处走走，探测风向。克莱门扎，等你把鲍里·嘎吐解决了，就把你的人调到林荫道这边来，调进这栋楼房，接替忒希奥的人。不过，忒希奥，还得让你的人继续在医院负责警卫工作。汤姆，明天早上你的头一件事就是打电话或派联络员同索洛佐和塔塔格里亚家族联系谈判的事。迈克明天带两个克莱门扎的人，到路加家里去等他，或查查他到底跑到哪里去了。这个混蛋王八羔子要是已经听到消息，此刻可能正在搜寻索洛佐。要说他背叛老头子，我绝不相信。那个“土耳其人”随便用什么引诱他，他也不至于走这一步。”">查看中文翻译</div>
