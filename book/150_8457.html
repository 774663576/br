<div class="line_en">He sought her face, but she turned it away; he sought her lips; she did not know what he was saying, broken, passionate words of love; and his arms held her so firmly that she felt like a child that has been lost and now at last is safe at home. She moaned faintly. Her eyes were closed and her face was wet with tears. And then he found her lips and the pressure of his upon them shot through her body like the flame of God. It was an ecstasy and she was burnt to a cinder and she glowed as though she were transfigured. In her dreams, in her dreams she had known this rapture. What was he doing with her now? She did not know. She was not a woman, her personality was dissolved, she was nothing but desire. He lifted her off her feet, she was very light in his arms, he carried her and she clung to him, desperate and adoring; her head sank on the pillow and his lips clung to hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把脸凑向她的脸，她扭到了一边。他又来亲她的嘴唇。她听不清他在说着什么甜言蜜语。他的胳膊紧紧地搂着她，她感觉自己是一个迷路的小孩，现在终于安全地回到了家。她轻声地呻吟着，闭上了眼睛，满脸都是泪痕。他终于找到了她的嘴唇，他的双唇贴上来的时候，她觉得一股力量穿越了她的身体，如同上帝的光芒一般辉煌热烈。那是一种幻觉，她似乎变成了一支燃烧殆尽的火炬，周身光辉四映，好像飞升幻化了一般。在她的梦里，在她的梦里她曾经体会过这样的感受。现在他要拿她怎么办？她不知道。她已经不是女人，她的精神融化了，身体里只留下了膨胀的欲望。他把她抱起来，在他的手臂上她是那么地轻。他抱着她朝床边走去，而她绝望而温顺地依偎在他的胸前。她的头陷到了枕头里，他的嘴唇贴了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was shaking and sobbing, struggling to get away from him, but the pressure of his arms was strangely comforting. She had so longed to feel them round her once more, just once, and all her body trembled. She felt dreadfully weak. It seemed as though her bones were melting, and the sorrow she felt for Walter shifted into pity for herself.</div>
