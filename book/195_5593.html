<div class="line_en">Philip avoided the places he had known in happier times. The little gatherings at the tavern in Beak Street were broken up: Macalister, having let down his friends, no longer went there, and Hayward was at the Cape. Only Lawson remained; and Philip, feeling that now the painter and he had nothing in common, did not wish to see him; but one Saturday afternoon, after dinner, having changed his clothes he walked down Regent Street to go to the free library in St. Martin's Lane, meaning to spend the afternoon there, and suddenly found himself face to face with him. His first instinct was to pass on without a word, but Lawson did not give him the opportunity.</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw the pain come into Lawson's eyes, he could not help it, he was sorry, but he had to think of himself; he could not bear the thought of discussing his situation, he could endure it only by determining resolutely not to think about it. He was afraid of his weakness if once he began to open his heart. Moreover, he took irresistible dislikes to the places where he had been miserable: he remembered the humiliation he had endured when he had waited in that studio, ravenous with hunger, for Lawson to offer him a meal, and the last occasion when he had taken the five shillings off him. He hated the sight of Lawson, because he recalled those days of utter abasement.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lawson nodded quickly and walked away. Philip felt a shiver pass through his heart. He had never before lost a friend of his own age, for the death of Cronshaw, a man so much older than himself, had seemed to come in the normal course of things. The news gave him a peculiar shock. It reminded him of his own mortality, for like everyone else Philip, knowing perfectly that all men must die, had no intimate feeling that the same must apply to himself; and Hayward's death, though he had long ceased to have any warm feeling for him, affected him deeply. He remembered on a sudden all the good talks they had had, and it pained him to think that they would never talk with one another again; he remembered their first meeting and the pleasant months they had spent together in Heidelberg. Philip's heart sank as he thought of the lost years. He walked on mechanically, not noticing where he went, and realised suddenly, with a movement of irritation, that instead of turning down the Haymarket he had sauntered along Shaftesbury Avenue. It bored him to retrace his steps; and besides, with that news, he did not want to read, he wanted to sit alone and think. He made up his mind to go to the British Museum. Solitude was now his only luxury. Since he had been at Lynn's he had often gone there and sat in front of the groups from the Parthenon; and, not deliberately thinking, had allowed their divine masses to rest his troubled soul. But this afternoon they had nothing to say to him, and after a few minutes, impatiently, he wandered out of the room. There were too many people, provincials with foolish faces, foreigners poring over guide-books; their hideousness besmirched the everlasting masterpieces, their restlessness troubled the god's immortal repose. He went into another room and here there was hardly anyone. Philip sat down wearily. His nerves were on edge. He could not get the people out of his mind. Sometimes at Lynn's they affected him in the same way, and he looked at them file past him with horror; they were so ugly and there was such meanness in their faces, it was terrifying; their features were distorted with paltry desires, and you felt they were strange to any ideas of beauty. They had furtive eyes and weak chins. There was no wickedness in them, but only pettiness and vulgarity. Their humour was a low facetiousness. Sometimes he found himself looking at them to see what animal they resembled (he tried not to, for it quickly became an obsession,) and he saw in them all the sheep or the horse or the fox or the goat. Human beings filled him with disgust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳森说完，点点头，转身走开了。菲利普心头微微一颤。他还从没像这样失去过同龄的朋友。克朗肖比他大许多，他的死似乎是非常自然的事。海沃德的死讯却让他莫名震惊。他想到早晚有一天自己也会离开人世。和所有人一样，菲利普也清楚人固有一死，可从没感觉死亡离得如此之近，甚至说不准哪天自己就会一命呜呼。尽管他和海沃德的友情早已不似当初，但听闻他的死讯，心里还是伤恸不已。过去两人之间的愉快交谈还历历在目，可今后却再也没有机会能跟他说上一句话了。他还记得第一次见面时的场景，记得在海德堡共度的快乐时光。然而那段日子一去不返了，他的心也随之沉沉下垂。他机械地迈着步子，不知要走到哪儿去。猛然间，他惊怒交集地意识到，自己竟走过秣市街，拐到沙夫茨伯里大道来了。他不想再掉头往回走，况且听到这个消息也无心继续读书了。只想静静地找个地方坐一坐，想一想。他决定去不列颠博物馆。孤独成了他现在唯一的奢侈享受。到林恩百货工作以来，他时常到博物馆去，一个人坐在帕特农神庙的群像雕塑前，放空思想，让这些带着灵性的圣物抚慰他不安的灵魂。可这天下午，神灵好似没有什么教诲要传达给他，过了几分钟，他心浮气躁地从展厅转了转，然后便离开了。博物馆里人山人海，从小地方赶来参观的人腆着一张痴痴呆呆的脸；外国佬在潜心研究游客指南。他们的粗野无知是对这些不朽杰作的侮辱，那躁动不安的心绪惊扰了诸神永恒的沉眠。菲利普去了另一间展厅，那里几乎没有什么人。他的身子疲倦地滑到地上，神经紧紧绷着，没法不去想外面那群聒噪的游人。有时在林恩商场，来来去去的人群同样使他特别烦躁。他恐惧万分地看着他们在眼前缓缓经过：这些人面目丑陋，神态刻薄；琐屑贪婪的欲望扭曲着他们的五官，你能感到他们对任何形态的美都毫无意识。鬼鬼祟祟的眼神、单薄窄小的下巴，他们确实不是作恶之人，只是斤斤计较、俗不可耐，就连幽默感里都带着肤浅的低级趣味。菲利普有时会看着他们，暗自把这些丑陋的面孔和某种动物匹配起来（他尽量不让自己这么做，因为没过多久，他竟着迷于此，不能自拔）。在这些人的脸上，他看到了绵羊、马、狐狸或山羊。菲利普的心里充满了对人类的厌恶之情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But presently the influence of the place descended upon him. He felt quieter. He began to look absently at the tombstones with which the room was lined. They were the work of Athenian stone masons of the fourth and fifth centuries before Christ, and they were very simple, work of no great talent but with the exquisite spirit of Athens upon them; time had mellowed the marble to the colour of honey, so that unconsciously one thought of the bees of Hymettus, and softened their outlines. Some represented a nude figure, seated on a bench, some the departure of the dead from those who loved him, and some the dead clasping hands with one who remained behind. On all was the tragic word farewell; that and nothing more. Their simplicity was infinitely touching. Friend parted from friend, the son from his mother, and the restraint made the survivor's grief more poignant. It was so long, long ago, and century upon century had passed over that unhappiness; for two thousand years those who wept had been dust as those they wept for. Yet the woe was alive still, and it filled Philip's heart so that he felt compassion spring up in it, and he said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然，他似乎受到这神圣之地的感召，心里沉静了许多。他开始漫不经心地看着展厅里排成一排的墓碑。这是公元前四五世纪雅典石匠的作品，设计、雕刻均朴实无华，却被赋以雅典人独特的精致气息。随着时间流逝，大理石的边角变得柔和圆润，被蚀成蜜色，让人无意间想起伊米托斯山的蜜蜂。有些墓碑刻成坐在沙滩上的裸体人像，有些描绘了死者与至亲好友离别的场景，还有一些则是将死之人紧紧地握着生者的手。每尊墓碑上都有一段悲戚的悼词，也只有这样一段悲戚的悼词，寥寥几字，让人无限唏嘘。这是朋友之间、母子之间的生死离别啊！这痛苦越是压抑克制反而越是心酸。日月变换，斗转星移，转眼已经过去几个世纪。两千年来，那些在坟前垂泪的人已经同他们哀悼的对象一起化为尘土，空余悲伤弥留人世。菲利普的心里涌起一阵哀怜，他喁喁感叹：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And it came to him that the gaping sight-seers and the fat strangers with their guide-books, and all those mean, common people who thronged the shop, with their trivial desires and vulgar cares, were mortal and must die. They too loved and must part from those they loved, the son from his mother, the wife from her husband; and perhaps it was more tragic because their lives were ugly and sordid, and they knew nothing that gave beauty to the world. There was one stone which was very beautiful, a bas relief of two young men holding each other's hand; and the reticence of line, the simplicity, made one like to think that the sculptor here had been touched with a genuine emotion. It was an exquisite memorial to that than which the world offers but one thing more precious, to a friendship; and as Philip looked at it, he felt the tears come to his eyes. He thought of Hayward and his eager admiration for him when first they met, and how disillusion had come and then indifference, till nothing held them together but habit and old memories. It was one of the queer things of life that you saw a person every day for months and were so intimate with him that you could not imagine existence without him; then separation came, and everything went on in the same way, and the companion who had seemed essential proved unnecessary. Your life proceeded and you did not even miss him. Philip thought of those early days in Heidelberg when Hayward, capable of great things, had been full of enthusiasm for the future, and how, little by little, achieving nothing, he had resigned himself to failure. Now he was dead. His death had been as futile as his life. He died ingloriously, of a stupid disease, failing once more, even at the end, to accomplish anything. It was just the same now as if he had never lived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又想到那些张着大嘴、举着游客手册的人，还有那些刻薄、庸俗，挤在商场里的顾客。这些有着俗欲杂念的人也不过凡人而已，迟早都会死去。他们也在爱着，也要被迫和所爱之人撒手离别，儿子与母亲、妻子与丈夫；也许正是因为他们的生命丑陋黯淡，所以死亡才更富有悲剧色彩。他们所熟悉的事物中，没有一件可以为这个世界增添美感。有一块墓碑异常美丽，石面上浅浅雕刻着两个并肩携手的年轻男人，细腻的线条、朴素的风格，让人觉得这石碑的雕塑者准是被这种真挚的情感深深打动。它是这世上的无上珍宝，不是为友谊而建，而是为庆祝这世上又多了一件珍贵不凡的宝物。菲利普看着这座丰碑，眼角湿润了。他想起了海沃德。初次见面，他就立刻喜欢上了他，但后来，初见时的光辉形象一点点破灭，两人的友情也越来越淡，最终只剩下习惯和回忆将他们勉强束在一起。这种经历可谓古怪之极：一个连续数月朝夕相处的人，一个同你亲密无间，甚至令你不敢想象生命里没有他的人，竟会在忽然一天与你永别。然而地球没有停止转动，一切依旧，曾经不可或缺的陪伴原来并没有想象的那么重要。日子照常过下去，甚至不曾想念过他。他记得早先在海德堡的那些日子，彼时的海沃德心怀志向，对未来充满美好憧憬，可他的锐气被一点点挫去，最终一事无成，放任自己坦然接受了这失败的命运。现在，他已经死去。他的死亡像他的生活一样毫无意义。窝窝囊囊地病死，算不上什么光彩的死因，他在人生的最后一步再次重重地跌倒，从生到死，一无是处。他白白活了一场，似乎从没在这世上存在过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The effort was so incommensurate with the result. The bright hopes of youth had to be paid for at such a bitter price of disillusionment. Pain and disease and unhappiness weighed down the scale so heavily. What did it all mean? He thought of his own life, the high hopes with which he had entered upon it, the limitations which his body forced upon him, his friendlessness, and the lack of affection which had surrounded his youth. He did not know that he had ever done anything but what seemed best to do, and what a cropper he had come! Other men, with no more advantages than he, succeeded, and others again, with many more, failed. It seemed pure chance. The rain fell alike upon the just and upon the unjust, and for nothing was there a why and a wherefore.</div>

It was the same with Cronshaw: it was quite unimportant that he had lived; he was dead and forgotten, his book of poems sold in remainder by second-hand booksellers; his life seemed to have served nothing except to give a pushing journalist occasion to write an article in a review.

<div class="line_en">Thinking of Cronshaw, Philip remembered the Persian rug which he had given him, telling him that it offered an answer to his question upon the meaning of life; and suddenly the answer occurred to him: he chuckled: now that he had it, it was like one of the puzzles which you worry over till you are shown the solution and then cannot imagine how it could ever have escaped you. The answer was obvious. Life had no meaning. On the earth, satellite of a star speeding through space, living things had arisen under the influence of conditions which were part of the planet's history; and as there had been a beginning of life upon it so, under the influence of other conditions, there would be an end: man, no more significant than other forms of life, had come not as the climax of creation but as a physical reaction to the environment. Philip remembered the story of the Eastern King who, desiring to know the history of man, was brought by a sage five hundred volumes; busy with affairs of state, he bade him go and condense it; in twenty years the sage returned and his history now was in no more than fifty volumes, but the King, too old then to read so many ponderous tomes, bade him go and shorten it once more; twenty years passed again and the sage, old and gray, brought a single book in which was the knowledge the King had sought; but the King lay on his death-bed, and he had no time to read even that; and then the sage gave him the history of man in a single line; it was this: he was born, he suffered, and he died. There was no meaning in life, and man by living served no end. It was immaterial whether he was born or not born, whether he lived or ceased to live. Life was insignificant and death without consequence. Philip exulted, as he had exulted in his boyhood when the weight of a belief in God was lifted from his shoulders: it seemed to him that the last burden of responsibility was taken from him; and for the first time he was utterly free. His insignificance was turned to power, and he felt himself suddenly equal with the cruel fate which had seemed to persecute him; for, if life was meaningless, the world was robbed of its cruelty. What he did or left undone did not matter. Failure was unimportant and success amounted to nothing. He was the most inconsiderate creature in that swarming mass of mankind which for a brief space occupied the surface of the earth; and he was almighty because he had wrenched from chaos the secret of its nothingness. Thoughts came tumbling over one another in Philip's eager fancy, and he took long breaths of joyous satisfaction. He felt inclined to leap and sing. He had not been so happy for months.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到克朗肖，菲利普就记起他给自己的那块波斯地毯。克朗肖说这里面隐含了关于人生意义的谜底。忽然，这个谜底出现在菲利普眼前，他哑然失笑。它像一个让人苦苦思索的谜题，可一旦找到答案，就会纳闷自己当时为何会百思而不得其解。答案很明显：生命没有意义。苍茫宇宙中，地球只是一颗飞速运转的行星。生命发源于此，产生在一片混沌之中。而这只是这颗星球的一段历史。如同生命在此孕育而生，同样地，在其他条件之下，也会在此毁灭而终。人类，并不比其他生命形式更加重要，也从不是造物主的巅峰杰作，只是在环境变迁下应时而生的自然反应罢了。菲利普想起一个东方国王的故事。国王想知道人这一辈子是怎样度过的，宫中贤士便给他拿来五百卷书，可他国事缠身，只好令贤士将这些书拿回去，概括一番。二十年后，贤士带着五十卷书回来了，但是国王年事已高，读不了这么大部头的书，便差他再回去精简概括。又过了二十年，垂垂老矣、满头白发的贤士带着一本书来找国王，这里面有他苦苦求索的答案。可国王已经长卧病榻，连这一本书都读不完了。贤士用一句话把人的一辈子概括给他听：生而受难，久难而终。生命没有意义。人活着没有目的。一个人是否降生在这世上，是否还活着或已经死去，这些都是无关紧要的事。生命微不足道，死亡更无足轻重。菲利普欢喜若狂，就像小时候刚刚摆脱对上帝的信仰时的感觉一样：似乎人生中最后一重枷锁已经从他身上卸掉，他第一次感受到了彻底的自由。他的卑微成为他的力量，他忽然觉得自己可以和迫害他许久的残酷命运来场勇敢的对峙。如果生命没有意义，这世间也就没有什么残忍可言了。他做过什么、还没有做什么，都已经无所谓了。失败不重要，成功也一文不值。他是这群占据地球表面很小一部分的人里最微小的一个。而他又无所不能，因为他从世间的纷乱混沌中参透了一个秘密：生命毫无意义。数不清的想法一个接一个在菲利普急切的想象中翻滚袭来，他深吸一口长气，喜悦而满足。他乐得想跳起来，想放声歌唱。几个月的时间以来，他从没有像今天这样开心过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the same uprush of fancy which had shown him with all the force of mathematical demonstration that life had no meaning, brought with it another idea; and that was why Cronshaw, he imagined, had given him the Persian rug. As the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the pleasure of his aesthetic sense, so might a man live his life, or if one was forced to believe that his actions were outside his choosing, so might a man look at his life, that it made a pattern. There was as little need to do this as there was use. It was merely something he did for his own pleasure. Out of the manifold events of his life, his deeds, his feelings, his thoughts, he might make a design, regular, elaborate, complicated, or beautiful; and though it might be no more than an illusion that he had the power of selection, though it might be no more than a fantastic legerdemain in which appearances were interwoven with moonbeams, that did not matter: it seemed, and so to him it was. In the vast warp of life (a river arising from no spring and flowing endlessly to no sea), with the background to his fancies that there was no meaning and that nothing was important, a man might get a personal satisfaction in selecting the various strands that worked out the pattern. There was one pattern, the most obvious, perfect, and beautiful, in which a man was born, grew to manhood, married, produced children, toiled for his bread, and died; but there were others, intricate and wonderful, in which happiness did not enter and in which success was not attempted; and in them might be discovered a more troubling grace. Some lives, and Hayward's was among them, the blind indifference of chance cut off while the design was still imperfect; and then the solace was comfortable that it did not matter; other lives, such as Cronshaw's, offered a pattern which was difficult to follow, the point of view had to be shifted and old standards had to be altered before one could understand that such a life was its own justification. Philip thought that in throwing over the desire for happiness he was casting aside the last of his illusions. His life had seemed horrible when it was measured by its happiness, but now he seemed to gather strength as he realised that it might be measured by something else. Happiness mattered as little as pain. They came in, both of them, as all the other details of his life came in, to the elaboration of the design. He seemed for an instant to stand above the accidents of his existence, and he felt that they could not affect him again as they had done before. Whatever happened to him now would be one more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern, and when the end approached he would rejoice in its completion. It would be a work of art, and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew of its existence, and with his death it would at once cease to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迸发的想象缜密精确地向菲利普展示了“生命没有意义”这一事实，他又忽然想到，这也许就是为什么克朗肖会给他那块波斯地毯吧。织毯子的人在编织花纹时也许仅仅凭借着一种审美的感觉，并不是出于什么“目的”。人生在世也是如此。或者说，如果一个人不得不相信自己的行为是不由自主的，那么他就可以这样看待生活，视生命为编织地毯上的花纹，既无意义，也无用处，只图一乐罢了。人们以生命中的一举一动、所感所想作为灵感，也许能设计出或规律、或精致、或复杂、或美丽的图案。尽管最终这只是一场幻觉，是妄想自己在这天地之间竟能拥有选择的权利；尽管这只是一出障眼戏法，是现实与幻想交织而成的迷梦，但这些都无关紧要了。起码看上去并不重要，或对菲利普而言并不重要。当你的手里握着生命厚重的经纱时（就像一条不知从何而起，也不知流往何处的大河），一旦清楚这世上本无意义可言，就能颇为自足地选择几根纬纱，编成想要的图案。有一种图案最为醒目、完整、美丽，它描绘了一从降生到成人，从婚恋到育子，为了一口果腹的干粮疲于奔命，最终在床榻上与世长辞。除此之外，生命还呈现出一些别的格局，错综复杂而精彩纷呈，只是其中寻不到幸福和成功的踪迹。相反，你能在这些图案里找到令人困扰和忧虑的雅致。有些人的生活，就像海沃德那样，图案还没有织完，就被盲目无情的命运一刀切断，等到那时，即使献上再温暖的安慰都已然无济于事。还有一些人，比如克朗肖，他们的生活轨迹让人难以效仿，要想理解这样的人生本身就是合理的，我们就必须要提前转换思维，重塑标准。菲利普觉得放弃对幸福的追求就是放弃自己最后的一丝幻想。之前，他总以过得是否幸福来衡量生命的价值，可最终却只能发现自己的生活过得一塌糊涂，而现在，他意识到也许衡量生命价值的标准并不在于此。幸福和痛苦都无关紧要。它们就像其他琐碎的细节，一同被设计到生活的图案之中。这一刹那，菲利普似乎凌驾于生活里的种种意外之上，而它们仿佛再不能像之前那样影响到他了。生命中的每首插曲都使复杂的图案更加精密，当日子终了那天，我们会因这幅图案的完成而欣慰不已。这将是艺术品，是最最美丽的杰作，因为只有设计者本人知道它的存在，随着他的死去，图案也将散如云烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
