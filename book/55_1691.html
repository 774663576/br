<div class="line_en">A government, according to the famous characterization by the sociologist Max Weber, is an institution that holds a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. Governments, then, are institutions that by their very nature are designed to carry out violence. Ideally this violence is held in reserve as a deterrent to criminals and invaders, but for millennia most governments showed no such restraint and indulged in violence exuberantly.</div>

<div class="line_en">All of the first complex states were despotisms in the sense of an "exercised right of heads of societies to murder their subjects arbitrarily and with impunity." Evidence for despotism, Laura Betzig has shown, may be found in the records of the Babylonians, Hebrews, Imperial Romans, Samoans, Fijians, Khmer, Natchez, Aztecs, Incas, and nine African kingdoms. Despots put their power to good Darwinian use by living in luxury and enjoying the services of enormous harems. According to a report from the early days of the British colonization of India, "a party given by the Mogul governor of Surat… was rudely interrupted when the host fell into a sudden rage and ordered all the dancing girls to be decapitated on the spot, to the stupefaction of the English guests." They could afford to be stupefied only because the mother country had recently put its own despotism behind it. When Henry VIII got into various of his bad moods, he executed two wives, several of their suspected lovers, many of his own advisors (including Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell), the Bible translator William Tyndale, and tens of thousands of others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说专制就是“社会的首领有权任意地，而且不受惩罚地杀害自己的臣民”，在这个意义上，最初出现的国家组织，全部都是专制主义国家。劳拉·贝齐格的研究已经表明，在巴比伦、希伯来、罗马帝国、萨摩亚、斐济、高棉、纳齐兹、阿兹特克、印加和九个非洲王国都可以找到专制统治的证据。这些专制统治者生活奢侈、后宫糜烂，充分地享受权力，把达尔文主义的“适者生存”发挥到了极限。一份早期英国殖民者在印度的报告提到，“苏拉特的莫卧儿总督举行了一次晚会…晚会受到干扰，因为主人突然大发雷霆，下令要将所有的舞女就地斩首。英国来宾被吓得目瞪口呆”。英国人之所以有资格被吓得目瞪口呆，是因为他们的国家刚刚结束了专制统治。亨利八世有着各式各样的坏脾气，他暴躁起来的时候，处死了两个妻子、几个被怀疑是她们情人的男子、多名他自己的顾问（包括托马斯·莫尔和托马斯·克伦威尔）、《圣经》翻译家威廉·廷代尔，还有数万名其他人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He who lives by the sword dies by the sword, and in most of human history political murder -- a challenger killing a leader and taking his place -- was the primary mechanism for the transfer of power. A political murderer differs from the modern assassin who tries to make a political statement, wants to go down in the history books, or is stark raving mad. Instead he is typically a member of the political elite, kills a leader to take over his position, and counts on his accession to be recognized as legitimate. Kings Saul, David, and Solomon were all targets or perpetrators of murder plots, and Julius Caesar was one of the thirty-four Roman emperors (out of the total of forty-nine that reigned until the division of the empire) who were killed by guards, high officials, or members of their own families. Manuel Eisner has calculated that between 600 and 1800 CE, about one in eight European monarchs was murdered in office, mostly by noblemen, and that a third of the killers took over the throne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而独裁者自己也是成于刀剑毁于刀剑。人类历史上的大多数时间里，政治谋杀——挑战者杀死首领，夺权篡位——是最主要的权力交接机制。政治谋杀不同于现代的暗杀，后者是政治宣言，执行人要的是载入史册，或者纯粹就是疯狂。从事政治谋杀的人本身就是政治精英集团的成员，弑君夺位，期望登基之后承继大统，被承认具备合法性。扫罗王、大卫王和所罗门王都曾经是谋杀阴谋的目标，或者是谋杀阴谋的参与者。在罗马帝国分崩离析之前，共经历了49位皇帝，其中34位是被卫兵、高官或者自己的家庭成员杀死的，尤里乌斯·恺撒不过是其中之一。曼纽尔·艾斯纳做过计算，在公元600年至1800年间，1/8的欧洲在位君主是被谋杀送命的，其中1/3的谋杀者篡夺了王位。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the 17th and 18th centuries, many countries had begun to cut back on tyranny and political murder. Between the early Middle Ages and 1800, Eisner calculates, the European regicide rate declined fivefold, particularly in Western and Northern Europe. A famous example of this change is the fate of the two Stuart kings who locked horns with the English Parliament. In 1649 Charles I was beheaded, but in 1688 his son James II was deposed bloodlessly in the Glorious Revolution. Even after attempting to stage a coup he was merely forced into exile. By 1776 the American revolutionaries had defined "despotism" down to the level of taxing tea and quartering soldiers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到17世纪和18世纪，许多国家的暴政和政治谋杀开始减少。艾斯纳估算，自中世纪到1800年间，欧洲弑君率下降至原来的1/5，在西欧和北欧特别突出。这种改变的典型是斯图亚特国王的命运。两位英王均与英国议会长期纷争，1649年，查理一世被砍头；但在1688年，他的儿子詹姆士二世在光荣革命中被不流血地请下王位。甚至在他试图政变之后，也只是被强迫去国流亡。到1776年，美国革命将“专制制度”的定义降低到对茶叶征税和为士兵提供食宿的水平。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Political leaders not only kill each other, but commonly commit mass violence against their citizenries. They may torture them, imprison them, execute them, starve them, or work them to death in pharaonic construction projects. Rummel estimates that governments killed 133 million people before the 20th century, and the total may be as high as 625 million. So once raiding and feuding have been brought under control in a society, the greatest opportunity for reducing violence is reducing government violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="政治领袖不仅仅相互残杀，通常还向自己的人民大规模使用暴力。他们对人民滥施酷刑、大兴牢狱、随意处决，而且让人民食不果腹，为了宏大的建筑工程拼死劳作。鲁梅尔估计，在20世纪之前，这些专制政府共杀害了1.33亿人，而总数则可能高达6.25亿人。所以，在一个社会中，一旦抢劫和仇杀得到控制，降低暴力的最大机会就是降低政府的暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the same time that governments were gradually becoming less tyrannical, thinkers were seeking a principled way to reel in government violence to the minimum necessary. It began with a conceptual revolution. Instead of taking government for granted as an organic part of the society, or as the local franchise of God's rule over his kingdom, people began to think of a government as a gadget -- a piece of technology invented by humans for the purpose of enhancing their collective welfare. Of course, governments had never been deliberately invented, and they had been in place long before history was recorded, so this way of thinking required a considerable leap of the imagination. Thinkers such as Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, and Rousseau, and later Jefferson, Hamilton, James Madison, and John Adams, fantasized about what life was like in a state of nature, and played out thought experiments about what a group of rational actors would come up with to better their lives. The resulting institutions would clearly bear no resemblance to the theocracies and hereditary monarchies of the day. It's hard to imagine a plausible simulation of rational actors in a state of nature choosing an arrangement that would give them the divine right of kings, "L'état, c'est moi," or inbred ten-year-olds ascending to the throne. Instead, the government would serve at the pleasure of the people it governed. Its power to "keep them all in awe," as Hobbes put it, was not a license to brutalize its citizens in pursuit of its own interests but only a mandate to implement the agreement "that a man be willing, when others are so too… to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，政府的专制性逐渐减弱，思想家们在不断地探索新的原则和方式，以便将政府的暴力约束在最低的必要水平之下。前锋是观念的革命。政府不再被视为一个社会的天然有机组成，或者是一个上帝用以统治其王国的地方分店，人们开始认为，政府就是一个小工具——一件人类的技术发明，目的是增加全体人民共同的福祉。当然，政府从来都不是一件刻意的发明，它早在有文字的人类历史之前就已经存在了，所以，这种新的思想方式确实需要超前的想象力。霍布斯、斯宾诺莎、洛克、卢梭，以及后来的杰斐逊、汉密尔顿、詹姆斯·麦迪逊和约翰·亚当斯，这些思想家都设想过在自然状态下人的生活会是什么样子，并在头脑里反复构思一群理性的人会怎样安排他们的生活。他们的结论是，新的制度与当时的神权政治和世袭君主制毫无相似之处。很难模拟想象，一个自然状态下的理性人，会选择君权神授这种制度安排——“朕，即国家”，或者让一位近亲生育的10岁儿童登上王位。相反，政府应该为自己的人民效劳。国家权力，也就是霍布斯所说的“让大家敬畏”的力量，并不意味着国家手持为谋求自己的私利而残害公民的许可证。这个力量不过是一项得自人民授权执行的协议，即“一个人，在其他人也愿意这样做的条件下，自愿放弃绝对的权利，并且同意，自己享有特定的自由，正如他容许其他人也只享有同样特定的自由一样”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's fair to say that Hobbes himself didn't think through the problem deeply enough. He imagined that somehow people would vest authority in a sovereign or a committee once and for all at the dawn of time, and thereafter it would embody their interests so perfectly that they would never have reason to question it. One only has to think of a typical American congressman or member of the British royal family (to say nothing of a generalissimo or a commissar) to see how this would be a recipe for disaster. Real-life Leviathans are human beings, with all the greed and foolishness we should expect of a specimen of Homo sapiens. Locke recognized that people in power would be tempted to "exempt themselves from the obedience to the Laws they make, and suit the Law, both in its making and its execution, to their own private Wish, and thereby come to have a distinct Interest from the rest of the Community, contrary to the end of Society and Government." He called for a separation between the legislative and executive branches of government, and for the citizenry to reserve the power to throw out a government that was no longer carrying out its mandate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们可以公平地说，霍布斯本人并没有将这个问题思考透彻。按照他的想象，在某个清晨时分，人民突然就给予一个主权国家或者一个委员会一次性的永久授权。在此之后，这个国家或委员会即充分地体现了他们的利益，以至于他们从此不再需要提出任何疑问。一个人只要设想一下美国的某位议员，或者英国王室的某位成员（且不说那些统帅或委员了），就会明白这样的安排会导致什么样的灾难。现实中的国家——利维坦是有血有肉的人，具备我们能够期望智人物种所可能具有的所有贪婪和愚昧。洛克承认，掌握了权力的人会受到诱惑，“使自己免受自己所制定的法律的约束，并在制定和执行法律的时候，让法律符合自己的意愿，从而有了置于社会其他成员的利益之上的私利，违反了组织社会和政府的初衷”。他呼吁立法权和行政权分立，而且一旦政府不再执行人民的意愿，公民有推翻政府的权利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This line of thinking was taken to the next level by the heirs of Hobbes and Locke who hashed out a design for American constitutional government after years of study and debate. They were obsessed with the problem of how a ruling body composed of fallible humans could wield enough force to prevent citizens from preying on each other without arrogating so much that it would become the most destructive predator of all. As Madison wrote, "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary." And so Locke's ideal of the separation of powers was written into the design of the new government, because "ambition must be made to counteract ambition." The result was the division of government into executive, judicial, and legislative branches, the federalist system in which authority was divided between the states and the national government, and periodic elections to force the government to give some attention to the wishes of the populace and to transfer power in an orderly and peaceable way. Perhaps most important, the government was given a circumscribed mission statement -- to secure the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness of its citizens, with their consent -- and, in the form of the Bill of Rights, a set of lines it could not cross in its use of violence against them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍布斯和洛克理论的继承人将他们的思想推向新的高度。经过长期的研究和争论，他们拿出了美国宪政政府的设计蓝图。一个由有缺陷的人组成的统治集团如何能够具备足够的力量，阻止公民之间相互侵害，同时自己又不会变得自大而成为最大的侵害力量，这就是设计师们念兹在兹的问题。麦迪逊写道：“如果人都是天使，政府就是没有必要的。如果是天使来管理人，无论是从外部还是从内部监管政府也都是没有必要的。”结果，洛克权力分立的思想被付诸新政府的设计，因为“必须以野心来抵抗野心”。于是，美国政府被分成行政、司法和立法三个权力部分。在联邦体系中，政府分为州和全国两级，定期的选举能够迫使政府关注大众的意愿，并有序地和平过渡权力。但最重要的也许是，政府存在的先决条件就是它要肩负的使命，即在公民的同意下，保障公民的生命、自由和追求幸福——并且，以《权利法案》的形式，界定一系列对政府权力的限制，约束政府不得对自己的人民实施暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The forms of democracy that were tried out in the 18th century were what you might expect of the 1.0 release of a complex new technology. The English implementation was weak tea, the French implementation an unmitigated disaster, and the American implementation had a flaw that is best captured in the actor Ice-T's impression of Thomas Jefferson reviewing a draft of the Constitution: "Let's see: freedom of speech; freedom of religion; freedom of the press; you can own niggers… Looks good to me!" But the value of the early designs for democracy was their upgradability. Not only did they carve out zones, however restricted, that were free of inquisitions, cruel punishments, and despotic authority, but they contained the means of their own expansion. The statement "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal," however hypocritical at the time, was a built-in rightswidener that could be invoked to end slavery four score and seven years later and other forms of racial coercion a century after that. The idea of democracy, once loosed on the world, would eventually infect larger and larger portions of it, and as we shall see, would turn out to be one of the greatest violence-reduction technologies since the appearance of government itself.</div>
