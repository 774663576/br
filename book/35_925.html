<div class="line_en">The birds had been there when they had first entered the chamber earlier in the day. And had he not felt, even then, something malevolent in the way these crows, blackbirds, woodpigeons looked down on them from the rafters? Or was it just that his memory had become coloured by subsequent events?</div>

<div class="line_en">For all his tiredness, Axl was finding sleep elusive. The monks had provided them with a room on the upper storey, and while it was a relief not to have to contend with the cold seeping up from the soil, he had never slept easily above ground. Even when sheltering in barns or stables, he had often climbed ladders to a restless night troubled by the cavernous space beneath him. Or perhaps his restlessness tonight had to do with the presence of the birds in the dark above. They were now largely silent, but every so often would come a small rustle, or a beating of wings, and he would feel the urge to fling his arms over Beatrice's sleeping form to protect her from the foul feathers drifting down through the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Or perhaps the sleeplessness was on account of the sounds, even now echoing across the monastery grounds, of Wistan chopping firewood. The noise had not prevented Beatrice from sinking easily into sleep, and on the other side of the room, beyond the dark shape he knew to be the table on which they had earlier eaten, Edwin had settled to a gentle snoring. But Wistan, as far as Axl knew, had not slept at all. The warrior had remained sitting over in the far corner, waiting for the last monk to leave the courtyard below, then gone out into the night. And now here he was again -- and despite Father Jonus's warning -- cutting more firewood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许，睡不着觉是因为维斯坦一直在叮叮当当砍柴，那声音现在仍旧在修道院里回荡。比特丽丝很快就睡着了，没受这声音影响；房间中央有个黑影，他知道那是桌子，之前他们在那儿吃饭的，桌子那边，在房间的另一头，埃德温也已经入睡，发出了低低的鼾声。但是，就他所知，维斯坦根本没睡。这位武士一直坐在远处的角落里，等最后一位僧侣离开了下面的院子，他才起身，消失在夜色中。现在他又来了——尽管乔纳斯神父警告过——又在劈柴火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Earlier, with the afternoon sun filling the chamber, Axl had looked out of the window to see what appeared to be the entire community -- more than forty monks -- waiting in clusters all around the courtyard. There was a furtive mood among them, as if they were keen their words were not overheard even by those in their own ranks, and Axl could see hostile glances exchanged. Their habits were all of the same brown cloth, sometimes missing a hood or a sleeve. They seemed anxious to go into the large stone building opposite, but there had been a delay and their impatience was palpable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之前，下午的阳光洒满房间的时候，埃克索曾朝窗户外面看过，似乎修道院的所有人都在那儿——四十多名僧侣——三五成群在院子里等候。人群里有一种偷偷摸摸的氛围，好像他们都不希望谈话被别人听到，哪怕是他们自己人。埃克索看到，有些僧侣看对方的眼神中有敌意。他们穿的修士长袍都是同样的褐色布料，有的缺顶帽子，有的缺条袖子。他们似乎急着到对面那幢大石头建筑里面去，但有什么事情耽搁了，大家显然都很焦躁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The monks had taken some time to disperse after emerging from their meeting. Several times Axl had come close to sleep only to be brought to the surface again by voices below. Sometimes they were four or five, always lowered, often filled with anger or fear. There had been no voices now for some time, and yet as he drifted again towards slumber, Axl could not shake the feeling there were still monks below their window, not just a few, but dozens of robed figures, standing silently under the moonlight, listening to Wistan's blows resounding across the grounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="僧侣们开完会后出了会场，过了很久才渐渐散去。有几次埃克索快睡着了，却被下面说话的声音吵醒了。有时候有四五个人的声音，都压得很低，往往带着愤怒或恐惧。现在，已经有一段时间没听到说话的声音了，可就在埃克索又一次慢慢进入梦乡时，他心里总觉得房间窗户下方还有僧侣，不止几个，而是几十个，穿着袍子，默默地站在月光下，听着维斯坦劈柴的声音在修道院中回响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl went to the door to relieve the man of the tray, but the monk -- Father Brian, as they were soon to learn he was called -- insisted on carrying it to the table himself, saying: "You are our guests, so let me serve you as such."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索走到门边，打算接过他手中的托盘，但这位僧侣——他们很快就知道他是布莱恩神父——坚持要自己把托盘放到桌上，还说：“你是我们的客人，那就让我来招待客人吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Axl had been gazing down on the courtyard for several moments when a noise made him lean further out of the window and look directly beneath him. He had seen then the outer wall of the building, its pale stone revealing yellow hues in the sun, and the staircase cut into it rising from the ground towards him. Midway up these stairs was a monk -- Axl could see the top of his head -- holding a tray laden with food and a jug of milk. The man was pausing to rebalance the tray, and Axl watched the manoeuvre with alarm, knowing how these steps were worn unevenly, and that with no rail on the outside, one had always to keep pressed to the wall to be sure not to plunge down onto the hard cobbles. On top of it all, the monk now ascending appeared to have a limp, yet he kept coming, slowly and steadily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索朝下方的院子里望了一会儿，这时传来一阵喧闹声，他身体探出窗外，朝正下方望去。他看到了建筑的外墙，白色的石头在阳光下显得发黄，外墙上凿有楼梯，从地面一直通到他跟前。楼梯半腰上有一位僧侣——埃克索能看到他的头顶——手里拿着托盘，上面放着食物和一罐牛奶。那人停下了脚步，以调整托盘的位置，埃克索看着他的动作，心里很紧张，他知道楼梯年深日久，磨得高低不平，外侧没有栏杆，人要紧贴着墙壁攀爬，否则一不小心，就会一头栽到下面的硬鹅卵石上。不仅如此，正在上楼的这位僧侣好像腿有些跛，可是他继续往上爬，很慢，但很稳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wistan and the boy had left by then, and perhaps the sound of their woodcutting was already ringing through the air. So it had been just he and Beatrice who had sat down, side by side, at the wooden table and devoured gratefully the bread, fruit and milk. As they did so, Father Brian had chatted happily, sometimes dreamily, about past visitors, the fish to be caught in nearby streams, a stray dog that had lived with them until its death the previous winter. Sometimes Father Brian, an elderly but sprightly man, got up from the table and shuffled about the room dragging about his bad leg, talking all the while, every now and then going to the window to check on his colleagues below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时候维斯坦和男孩已经走了，也许空气中已经回响起了他们劈柴的声音。因此就只有他和比特丽丝肩并肩，在木头桌子旁坐下来，心怀感激地享用着面包、水果和牛奶。他们用餐时，布莱恩神父高兴地说着话，有时候好像梦呓一般，谈以前的客人、附近小河里能抓到的鱼，以及去年冬天死前一直和他们生活在一起的一条野狗。布莱恩神父上了年纪，但精力不错，有时候他从桌旁站起身来，拖着那条坏腿在房间里走来走去，嘴里不停地说着话，还不时到窗户前看看下面的同事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, above their heads, the birds had been criss-crossing the underside of the roof, their feathers occasionally drifting down to blemish the surface of the milk. Axl had been tempted to chase off these birds, but had refrained in case the monks regarded them with affection. He was taken aback then when rapid footsteps came up the stairs outside, and a large monk with a dark beard and a flushed face burst into the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，在他们头顶上方，那些鸟一直在屋顶下面来回穿梭，偶尔会有羽毛飘下来，落在牛奶上。埃克索本打算把鸟赶走，但他担心僧侣们也许喜欢这些鸟，所以没赶。后来，外面的楼梯上传来急促的脚步声，一个身材高大的僧侣，留着黑胡子，满面通红，闯进了房间，让埃克索吃了一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was surely the case that then, as now, the warrior's axe blows had been ringing across the courtyard. In fact, Axl could distinctly recall asking himself, as he watched the monks filing into the building opposite, if he was hearing one woodcutter or two; for a second blow would follow so close behind the first it was hard to tell if it was a real sound or an echo. Thinking about it now, lying in the dark, Axl was sure Edwin had been chopping alongside Wistan, matching the warrior blow for blow. In all likelihood the boy was already an expert woodcutter. Earlier that day, before they had come to this monastery, he had astonished them by digging so rapidly with two flat stones he had happened to find nearby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="武士用斧头劈柴的声音，那时候肯定就在院子里回响，和现在一样。实际上，埃克索仍能清晰地回忆起来，当时他一边看着僧侣们列队进入对面的建筑，一边心里疑惑：从传来的声音看，这是一个人劈柴，还是两个人呢？因为第一声劈柴的声音刚传来，紧接着又响起了第二声，很难判断后者是劈柴发出的声音，还是前一声的回声。现在，埃克索在黑暗中躺着，回想这件事情，他相信当时埃德温也在那儿，一斧子一斧子跟着维斯坦劈柴。男孩很可能已经很会砍柴了。当天早些时候，在他们到修道院之前，男孩曾用随手找到的两块扁石头飞快地挖坑，让大家都很惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He'll believe it well enough, sir," Gawain had replied, continuing to dig. "There's a coolness between us, but he has me for an honest fool without the wit to invent devious tales. I may tell them how the soldier spoke of bandits even as he bled to death in my arms. Some will think it a grave sin to tell such a lie, yet I know God will look mercifully on it, for isn't it to stop further bloodshed? I'll make Brennus believe me, sir.

<div class="line_en">Axl by then had ceased to dig, having been persuaded by the warrior to preserve his strength for the climb to the monastery. So he had stood beside the oozing body of the soldier, guarding it from the birds gathering in the branches. Wistan, Axl recalled, had been using the dead man's sword to dig the grave, remarking that he was reluctant to blunt his own on such a task. Sir Gawain, however, had said: "This soldier died honourably, no matter the schemes of his master, and a knight's sword is put to good use giving him a grave." Both men, though, had paused to watch in wonder the progress being made by Edwin with his rudimentary tools. Then, as they resumed their work, Wistan had said:</div>

<div class="line_en">He had been on horseback, and in front of him was mounted his companion, a man called Harvey, the smell of whose heavy body overpowered that of their horses. They had halted in the midst of the windswept wilderness because they had spotted movement in the distance, and once it was clear it signified no threat, Axl had stretched his arms -- they had been riding a long time -- and watched the tail of Harvey's horse swinging from side to side as though to prevent the flies settling on its rear. Although his companion's face was hidden from him at that moment, the shape of Harvey's back, indeed his whole posture, announced the malevolence aroused by the sight of the approaching party. Gazing past Harvey, Axl could now make out the dark dots that were the sheep's faces, and moving among them four men -- one on a donkey, the others on foot. There appeared to be no dogs. The shepherds, Axl supposed, must long ago have spotted them -- two riders clearly outlined against the sky -- but if they had felt apprehension there was no sign of it in their slow, relentless trudge forwards. There was, in any case, just the one long path across the moor, and Axl supposed the shepherds could avoid them only by turning back.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the group came nearer, he could see that all four men, though far from old, were sickly and thin. This observation brought a sinking to his heart, for he knew the men's condition would only further provoke his companion's savagery. Axl waited until the party was almost within hailing distance, then nudged forward his horse, positioning it carefully to the side of Harvey where he knew the shepherds, and most of the flock, were bound to pass. He made sure to keep his own horse a nose behind, to allow his companion the illusion of seniority. Yet Axl was now in a position that would shield the shepherds from any sudden assault Harvey might launch with his whip, or with the club hooked to his saddle. All the while, the manoeuvre would have suggested on the surface only camaraderie, and in any case, Harvey did not possess the subtlety of mind even to suspect its real purpose. Indeed, Axl recalled his companion nodding absent-mindedly as he drew up, before turning back to stare moodily across the moor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对方慢慢走近，他看到四个人虽然年纪不算老，却都瘦弱憔悴。他心中一沉，因为他知道，这些人的虚弱模样只会刺激同伴，让他更加野蛮。埃克索等待着，四个人到了几乎可以打招呼致意的距离，他立即催马向前，小心地赶到哈维坐骑的一侧，他知道牧羊人和大部分羊肯定要从这边经过。他特别让自己的马落后一头，以便同伴能够维持优越感。但是，如果哈维挥动马鞭，或者拿起挂在马鞍上的棒子，对牧羊人发起突然攻击，那么埃克索正好挡在中间。同时，这一举动从表面上看，是亲密友好的表示，何况哈维也没有这么缜密的心思，不会去怀疑背后的真正动机。的确，埃克索还记得，他骑马上去的时候，同伴还漫不经心地点了点头，然后又转过脸去，神情抑郁地望着茫茫荒野。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Axl had been especially anxious on behalf of the approaching shepherds because of something that had occurred a few days earlier in a Saxon village. It had been a sunny morning, and on that occasion Axl had been as startled as any of the villagers. Without warning, Harvey had heeled his horse forward and started to rain down blows on the people waiting to draw water from the well. Had Harvey used his whip or his club on that occasion? Axl had tried to recall this detail that day on the moor. If Harvey chose to assault the passing shepherds with his whip, the reach would be greater and require less leverage of the arm; he might even dare to swing it over the head of Axl's horse. If, however, he chose his club, with Axl positioned as he now was, Harvey would be obliged to push his horse beyond Axl's and rotate partially before attacking. Such a manoeuvre would appear too deliberate for his companion: Harvey was the type that liked his savagery to look impulsive and effortless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迎面走来的牧羊人让埃克索特别担心，这是因为几天前在一个撒克逊村庄里发生了一件事情。那是个天气晴朗的上午，当时埃克索和村民们一样大吃一惊。事先毫无征兆，哈维突然催马向前，疯狂地殴打等待从井中汲水的人们。那次哈维用的是鞭子还是棒子？在荒野上骑马的那天，埃克索曾试图回想这一细节。如果哈维选择用鞭子打路过的牧羊人，那范围要大一些，胳膊也更省力些；他甚至可能冒险，将鞭子从埃克索的马头上方挥过去。但是，如果哈维选择用棒子的话，鉴于埃克索现在的位置，他就必须催马到埃克索前方，再拨转马头，然后才能攻击。对他的同伴来说，那样的举动就太刻意了：哈维这个人，喜欢让暴力行为看起来像兴致所至、不费气力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not remember now if his careful actions had saved the shepherds. He had a vague recollection of sheep drifting innocently past them, but his memory of the shepherds themselves had become confusingly bound up with that attack on the villagers by the well. What had brought the pair of them to that village that morning? Axl remembered the cries of outrage, children crying, the looks of hatred, and his own fury, not so much at Harvey himself, but at those who had handicapped him with such a companion. Their mission, if accomplished, would surely be an achievement unique and new, one so supreme God himself would judge it a moment when men came a step closer to him.

<div class="line_en">The grey-haired soldier came back into his thoughts, and the little half-gesture he had made on the bridge. As his stocky colleague had shouted and pulled on Wistan's hair, the grey-haired man had started to raise his arm, his fingers almost in a pointing gesture, a reprimand all but escaping his lips. Then he had let his arm fall. Axl had understood exactly what the grey-haired man had experienced during those moments. The soldier had then spoken with particular gentleness to Beatrice, and Axl had been grateful to him. He recalled Beatrice's expression as she had stood before the bridge, changing from grave and guarded to the softly smiling one so dear to him. The picture now seized his heart, and at the same time made him fearful. A stranger -- a potentially dangerous one at that -- had but to say a few kindly words and there she was, ready to trust the world again. The thought troubled him and he felt the urge to run his hand gently over the shoulder now beside him. But had she not always been thus? Was it not part of what made her so precious to him?

<div class="line_en">The woodcutting noises, which had paused for a while, now started up again, and it occurred to Axl the warrior might remain outside the entire night. Wistan appeared calm and thoughtful, even in combat, yet it was possible the tensions of the day and previous night had mounted on his nerves, and he needed to work them off in this way. Even so, his behaviour was odd. Father Jonus had specifically warned against further woodcutting, yet here he was, back at it again and with night well fallen. Earlier, when they had first arrived, it had seemed a simple courtesy on the warrior's part. And at that point, as Axl had discovered, Wistan had had his own reasons for cutting wood.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“先生，我承认，我并没有确切的依据怀疑这儿有问题。也许是出于武士的本能吧，我真希望我腰带上挂着剑，不用再假装成农夫了。我感到担心，或许是因为这些墙壁在悄悄跟我说着以前的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Further, Master Axl, I'd wager this fort was once in Saxon hands, for I see about it many signs of my kin perhaps invisible to you. Look there"-- Wistan pointed down to a cobbled yard below hemmed in by walls --"I fancy just there stood a second gate, much stronger than the first, yet hidden to invaders climbing the road. They saw only the first and strained to storm it, but that gate would have been what we Saxons call a watergate, after those barriers that control a river's flow. Through this watergate would be let past, quite deliberately, a measured number of the enemy. Then the watergate would close on those following. Now those isolated between the two gates, in that space just there, would find themselves outnumbered, and once again, attacked from above. They would be slaughtered before the next group let through. You see how it worked, sir. This is today a place of peace and prayer, yet you needn't gaze so deep to find blood and terror."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有呢，埃克索阁下，我敢打赌，这要塞以前肯定是在撒克逊人手里，因为我看到了我同族人的很多记号，也许你看不到。你看那儿——”维斯坦指着下面一个铺着鹅卵石的院子，院子四周有围墙——“我猜，就在那儿，以前有第二道大门，比第一道更加坚固，但从那条路爬上来的入侵者却看不见。他们只看到第一道门，于是拼命攻打，但其实那是我们撒克逊人说的水闸门，就像控制河水的水闸一样。守军可以先计算好，有意把一部分敌人放进来，然后关上水闸门，把后面跟上来的敌人挡在外面。这时候，放进来的敌人就在两道门之间，被孤立了，就在那个地方。他们人数不够，会再次受到来自上面的攻击。先将他们杀光，然后再放下一拨人进来。你明白这个道理了吧，先生。今天，这是个和平而虔诚的地方，但用不着太费力，你就能看到流血和恐怖。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only that not long ago, this place was surely no monastery, but a hillfort, and one well made to fight off foes. You recall the exhausting road we climbed? How the path turned back and forth as though eager to drain our strength? Look down there now, sir, see the battlements running above those same paths. It's from there the defenders once showered their guests from above with arrows, rocks, boiling water. It would have been a feat merely to reach the gate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个地方不久之前肯定不是什么修道院，而是个山顶要塞，而且建造得很好，为的是抵御敌人。我们爬上山的那条累人的路，你还记得吧？绕来绕去，好像就是要让我们用尽气力一样？现在你往下看看，先生，你看那些路上方的防御工事。以前守军就从那儿用弓箭、石头和滚烫的水来对付入侵者。那时候，如果能到达大门口，就算是了不起的事情了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They've reached this, their sanctuary, only after long torment, death chasing at their heels. And now comes an invading army of overwhelming size. The fort may hold several days, perhaps even a week or two. But they know in the end they will face their own slaughter. They know the infants they circle in their arms will before long be bloodied toys kicked about these cobbles. They know because they've seen it already, from whence they fled. They've seen the enemy burn and cut, take turns to rape young girls even as they lie dying of their wounds. They know this is to come, and so must cherish the earlier days of the siege, when the enemy first pay the price for what they will later do. In other words, Master Axl, it's vengeance to be relished in advance by those not able to take it in its proper place. That's why I say, sir, my Saxon cousins would have stood here to cheer and clap, and the more cruel the death, the more merry they would have been."</div>

What arrested the attention was a large cage mounted on its carriage, and coming closer, Axl noticed that though the cage was itself iron, a thick wooden pillar ran down its spine, fixing it firmly to the boards underneath. This same post was festooned with chains and manacles, and at head height, what appeared to be a blackened iron mask, though with no holes for the eyes, and only a small one for the mouth. The cart, and the area all around it, was covered with feathers and droppings. Edwin pulled open the cage door and proceeded to move it back and forth on its squeaking hinge.

<div class="line_en">The monastery buildings were now dark shapes against the setting sky. As they drew closer, the monk paused, moved his forefinger over his lips, then continued at a more cautious pace. He seemed anxious they remain unseen, and to avoid the central courtyard. He took them down narrow passageways behind buildings where the earth was pitted or sloped severely. Once, as they went with heads bowed along a wall, there came from the very windows above sounds from the monks' conference. One voice was shouting over a hubbub, then a second voice -- perhaps that of the abbot -- called for order. But there was no time to loiter, and soon they were gathered at an archway through which could be seen the main courtyard. The monk now indicated with urgent signs that they were to proceed as quickly and quietly as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">The corridors now became as tunnel-like as those of their warren at home, and the lamps flickering in the little alcoves hardly dispelled the darkness. Axl, with Beatrice holding his arm, kept a hand held out before him. For a moment they were back in the open air, crossing a muddy yard between ploughed allotments, then into another low stone building. Here the corridor was wider and lit by larger flames, and the monk seemed finally to relax. Recovering his breath, he looked them over once more, then signalling for them to wait, vanished under an arch. After a little time, the monk appeared again and ushered them forward. As he did so, a frail voice from within said: "Come in, guests. A poor chamber this to receive you, but you're welcome."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通道变得像隧道一样，和他们家乡的巢穴村差不多，小壁龛里的灯摇曳不定，无法驱散黑暗。比特丽丝挽着埃克索的胳膊，埃克索则把一只手伸在前面。有一下子他们又回到了户外，穿过一个泥泞的院子，两侧是耕耘过的一块块田地，然后进入了另一幢低矮的石头建筑。这儿通道更宽，灯火也更亮，僧侣似乎终于放松了下来。他喘了口气，又一次打量着大家，然后打手势让他们等着，自己走进一道拱门，消失了。过了一会儿，僧侣出来，带大家往里走。里面一个虚弱的声音说道，“进来吧，客人们。这个房间招待客人过于简陋，但欢迎你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he waited for sleep to come to him, Axl recalled once again how the four of them, together with the silent monk, had squeezed into the tiny cell. A candle was burning next to the bed, and he had felt Beatrice recoil as she caught sight of the figure lying in it. Then she had taken a breath and moved further into the room. There was hardly space for them all, but they had before long arranged themselves around the bed, the warrior and the boy in the corner furthest away. Axl's back was pressed against the chilly stone wall, but Beatrice, standing just in front and leaning into him as if for reassurance, was almost up to the sickbed. There was a faint smell of vomit and urine. The silent monk, meanwhile, was fussing about the man in the bed, helping to raise him to a sitting position.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索一边等着睡意降临，一边又回想起他们四个人和那位沉默的僧侣一起，挤进了那个小小的房间。床边点着一根蜡烛，他感到比特丽丝往后缩了一下，因为她看到了躺在床上的那个人。然后她吸了口气，朝房间里面又迈了两步。屋里几乎挤不下，但很快大家就围着床找到了自己的位置，武士和男孩待在最远处的角落里。埃克索的后背紧贴着冰冷的石头墙，比特丽丝就站在他跟前，紧靠在他身上，好像这样心里踏实一点一样——她都快挤到病床上去了。隐约有呕吐和小便的气味。那位沉默的僧侣正围着床上的人忙活，帮助他坐起身来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their host was white-haired and advanced in years. His frame was large, and until recently must have been vigorous, but now the simple act of sitting up appeared to cause multiple agonies. A coarse blanket fell from around him as he raised himself, revealing a nightshirt patched with bloodstains. But what had caused Beatrice to shrink back was the man's neck and face, starkly illuminated by the bedside candle. A swollen mound under one side of the chin, a deep purple fading to a yellow, obliged the head to be held at a slight angle. The peak of the mound was split and caked with pus and old blood. On the face itself, a gouge ran from just below the cheek bone down to the jaw, exposing a section of the man's inner mouth and gum. It must have cost him greatly to smile, but once he was settled in his new position, the monk did just this.</div>

Others of our view will say it's time to stop. That no forgiveness awaits us at the end of this path. That we must uncover what's been hidden and face the past.

<div class="line_en">For a moment Wistan remained still. Then he moved aside, signalling to Edwin to step forward. Immediately the silent monk helped Father Jonus to a more upright position -- both monks had become suddenly quite animated -- then grasping the candleholder from the bedside, tugged Edwin closer, impatiently raising the boy's shirt for Father Jonus to see. Then, for what seemed a long time, both monks went on looking at the boy's wound -- Ninian moving the light one way then the other -- as though it were a pool within which a miniature world was contained. Eventually the monks exchanged what seemed to Axl looks of triumph, but the very next moment Father Jonus fell shaking back onto his pillows, with an expression closer to resignation or else sadness. As Ninian hastily put down the candle to attend to him, Edwin slipped back into the shadows to stand beside Wistan.</div>

Yet she said if there was one wise enough to know, it would be you, Father Jonus, up here in this monastery. So my husband and I made our way here, even though it's a harder road to our son's village where we're impatiently awaited. It was my hope you'd tell us something of this mist and how Axl and I might be free of it. It may be I'm a foolish woman, but it seemed to me just now, for all the talk of shepherds, you and Master Wistan were speaking of this same mist, and much bothered by what's been lost of our past.

There had been some reason, and even when Beatrice, triumphant to discover the origin of the mist, had turned to him and exclaimed, he had been able only to reach out his hand to her, still not speaking. He had been in the throes of some powerful and strange emotion, one that had all but put him in a dream, though every word being spoken around him still reached his ears with perfect clarity. He had felt as one standing in a boat on a wintry river, looking out into dense fog, knowing it would at any moment part to reveal vivid glimpses of the land ahead. And he had been caught in a kind of terror, yet at the same time had felt a curiosity -- or something stronger and darker -- and he had told himself firmly, "Whatever it may be, let me see it, let me see it."</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not remember clearly what had happened once Wistan and the boy had departed Father Jonus's chamber. The silent monk, Ninian, must have left with them, probably to provide the ointment for the boy's wound, or simply to lead them back unobserved. In any case, he and Beatrice had been left alone with Father Jonus, and the latter, despite his wounds and his exhaustion, had examined his wife thoroughly. The monk had not asked her to remove any clothing -- Axl had been relieved -- and though here too his recollection was hazy, an image came to him of Jonus pressing an ear to Beatrice's side, eyes closed in concentration as though some faint message might be heard coming from within. Axl remembered too the monk, with blinking eyes, putting to Beatrice a series of questions. Did she feel sick after drinking water? Did she ever feel pain at the back of her neck? There were other questions Axl could now no longer remember, but Beatrice had replied in the negative to one after the next, and the more she did so, the more pleased Axl had become. Only once, when Jonus asked if she had noticed blood in her urine, and she replied that yes, she sometimes had, did Axl feel unease. But the monk had nodded, as though this was normal and to be expected, and gone straight on to the next question. How then had this examination ended? He remembered Father Jonus smiling and saying, "So you can go to your son with nothing to fear," and Axl himself saying, "You see, princess, I always knew it was nothing." Then the monk had eased himself carefully back down in his bed and lain there, recovering his breath. In Ninian's absence, Axl had hurried to fill the monk's drinking cup from the jug, and as he had placed it to the sick man's mouth, had seen tiny droplets of blood slide from the lower lip and spread in the water. Then Father Jonus had looked up at Beatrice and said:</div>
