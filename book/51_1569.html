<div class="line_en">There must have been some mistake. This can't be happening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! Her chances of being chosen so remote that I'd not even bothered to worry about her. Hadn't I done everything? Taken the tesserae, refused to let her do the same? One slip. One slip in thousands. The odds had been entirely in her favor. But it hadn't mattered.</div>

<div class="line_en">That's how I feel now, trying to remember how to breathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull. Someone is gripping my arm, a boy from the Seam, and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而此时，我的感觉正是如此，我试图回忆怎样呼吸，我说不出话来，这个名字在我的脑子里回荡着，我完全被震蒙了，身体瘫软，一阵晕眩，这时一个“夹缝地带”的男孩子赶紧扶住了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting motionless for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell ten feet to the ground, landing on my back. It was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somewhere far away, I can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair. And then I see her, the blood drained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, walking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing me, and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt. It's this detail, the untucked blouse forming a ducktail, that brings me back to myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远处，人群中传来不满的低语，像以往一样大家认为一个十二岁的孩子被抽中有失公平。这时我看到了波丽姆从我身旁走过，脸上没有一丝血色，紧握的双拳垂在身体两侧，她身体僵直，步履艰难，走向台子。我看到她的衬衫又松了，像鸭尾一样从裙子里耷拉出来。正是这个不引人注目的细微之处，才使我猛然间回过神来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's some confusion on the stage. District 12 hasn't had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty. The rule is that once a tribute's name has been pulled from the ball, another eligible boy, if a boy's name has been read, or girl, if a girl's name has been read, can step forward to take his or her place. In some districts, in which winning the reaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the volunteering is complicated. But in District 12, where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse, volunteers are all but extinct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="台上有些混乱。十二区在几十年的时间里都没有志愿者，这项规定都快被遗忘了。按规定，如果一个孩子，无论男孩或女孩，名字被抽到，另一个侯选男孩或女孩可以代替他或她。在另外一些区，在收获节仪式上被选中是一件很光荣的事，有不少人甘愿为此冒生命危险，自愿参赛的程序非常复杂。可在十二区，“贡品”跟“尸体”几乎是同义词，自愿者也因而绝迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Prim!" The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and my muscles begin to move again. "Prim!" I don't need to shove through the crowd. The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, I push her behind me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“波丽姆！”我用沙哑的声音喊着，胳膊腿能听我使唤了。“波丽姆！”不需要在人群中挤，其他的孩子已经给我让出一条道，直通到台子。波丽姆刚要上台时，我追上了她，手臂一挥，把她推到身后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What does it matter?" says the mayor. He's looking at me with a pained expression on his face. He doesn't know me really, but there's a faint recognition there. I am the girl who brings the strawberries. The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion. The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and sister, as he presented her, the oldest child, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, vaporized in the mines. Does he remember that? "What does it matter?" he repeats gruffly. "Let her come forward."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这有什么关系吗？”市长说。他看着我，脸上带着痛苦的表情。他不大认识我，也许只是隐隐约约知道一点。我是那个卖草莓的女孩，他女儿也许偶尔提起过我。五年前，这个女孩与她的妈妈和妹妹依偎在一起出现在他的面前，他把这个家中的长子介绍给大家，并颁发给她一枚勇敢者奖章，这枚奖章是奖励给她的爸爸——那个在矿难中被炸死的人。他记起这些了吗？“有什么问题吗？”他又粗声问道，“让她到前边来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not one person claps. Not even the ones holding betting slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring. Possibly because they know me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encountered Prim, who no one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging applause, I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于对十二区永久名誉的维护，没有一个人鼓掌，甚至连那些平常对人最漠不关心的赌徒都没有鼓掌。或许他们在黑市认识了我，或许认识我爸爸，或许见过帕莱——那个人见人爱的女孩。此时，没有掌声，我只是一动不动地站在那里；人们以最大胆的方式表达着内心的不满。台下一片寂静。这表明他们不同意，也不会宽恕凯匹特人的所作所为。这一切都是错的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then something unexpected happens. At least, I don't expect it because I don't think of District 12 as a place that cares about me. But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prim's place, and now it seems I have become someone precious. At first one, then another, then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone you love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时意想不到的事发生了。至少我没有想到，因为我觉得十二区是一个不会给我关爱的地方。但从我踏上台子的那一刻起，变化就发生了，此刻，我成了倍受珍爱的人。开始是一个人，然后又一个，最后几乎所有的人都举起左手，他们将中间三个手指放在嘴唇上，之后又指向我。这是我们区古老的手势，它已经很少使用了，只有在葬礼上才会偶尔见到。它意味着感谢、意味着崇敬意、意味着向所爱的人说再见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I had been in town, trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prim's in the public market, but there were no takers. Although I had been to the Hob on several occasions with my father, I was too frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The rain had soaked through my father's hunting jacket, leaving me chilled to the bone. For three days, we'd had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves I'd found in the back of a cupboard. By the time the market closed, I was shaking so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle. I didn't pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable to regain my feet. Besides, no one wanted those clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. Punishable by death. But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins, and those were fair game. Perhaps a bone at the butcher's or rotted vegetables at the grocer's, something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat. Unfortunately, the bins had just been emptied.</div>

<div class="line_en">I found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople.

I lifted the lid to the baker's trash bin and found it spotlessly, heartlessly bare.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to see the baker's wife, telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash. The words were ugly and I had no defense. As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away, I noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mother's back. I'd seen him at school. He was in my year, but I didn't know his name. He stuck with the town kids, so how would I? His mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that I'd have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too much. I was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home, I thought. Or better yet, let me die right here in the rain.</div>

<div class="line_en">To this day, I can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed. And more than once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe him something, and I hate owing people. Maybe if I had thanked him at some point, I'd be feeling less conflicted now. I thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never seemed to present itself. And now it never will. Because we're going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there?

But as I collected Prim and started for home that afternoon, I found him staring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second, then he turned his head away. I dropped my gaze, embarrassed, and that's when I saw it. The first dandelion of the year. A bell went off in my head.
