<div class="line_en">The neighborhood created their lifestyle. They were within walking distance of several bars -- their favorites were the Athenian inside the Market, and the smoky old Virginia Inn on the corner. At six o'clock in the morning, amid the beeping of delivery trucks and the honking of horns, they walked across the street for lattes from Starbucks and bought croissants from La Panier, a French bakery.</div>

<div class="line_en">As working single girls, they fell into an easy routine. Each morning they went out for breakfast, sat at ironwork tables on the sidewalk, and read the various papers that they collected. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the Seattle Times and Post-Intelligencer became their bibles. When they were done, they drove to the office, where every day they learned something new about the business of TV news, and after work, they changed into glittery big shoulder-padded tunics and peg-legged pants and went to one of the many downtown clubs. On any given night they could listen to punk rock, new wave, rock 'n' roll, or pop -- whatever they felt like.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身为单身上班族，她们的生活规律而悠闲。每天早上她们出门吃早餐，坐在街边的锻铁餐桌旁阅读她们收集来的报纸，《纽约时报》《华尔街日报》《西雅图时报》与《邮讯报》更成为她们的《圣经》。吃完早餐后，她们开车去公司，每天都能在那里学到关于电视新闻报道的知识；下班后她们换上有大垫肩的闪亮上衣与老爷裤，造访市区许许多多的夜店，各种音乐都有——朋克、新浪潮、摇滚、流行，随她们的心情挑选。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The summer after graduation came as close to Heaven as Tully could imagine. She and Kate found a cheap 1960s-style apartment in a great location -- above the Pike Place Market. They brought in furniture from Gran's house and filled the kitchen with forty-year-old Revereware pots and Spode china. On the walls, they tacked up favorite posters and put pictures of themselves on all the end tables. Mrs. Mularkey had surprised them one day with bags of groceries and several silk plants, to give the place a homey feel, she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毕业那年的夏天，对塔莉而言简直有如天堂。她和凯蒂找到一间20世纪60年代风格的公寓，地段非常理想，就在帕克市场楼上。她们搬来外婆的旧家具，厨房里的康宁厨具与英国瓷器都有四十年历史。她们挂上喜欢的海报，小茶几上摆着两人的照片。穆勒齐伯母有一天突然来访，送来几袋生活用品与几盆人造花，说是要为她们的公寓增添温馨气氛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate had lost track of the times she'd seen Mutt roll his eyes as Tully walked away from a conversation.

<div class="line_en">When Tully was here, there was the noise and commotion. She lived for TV news and no moment of it was beneath her contemplation. All day, every day, she badgered Johnny and Carol and Mutt with questions; she continually sought their collective advice on every topic.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate, on the other hand, cared about the people in the office more than she cared about the stories they followed. She had been befriended almost instantly by Carol, who often took her out to lunch to talk about her impending birth, and just as often called upon Kate to edit her copy or research stories. Mutt, too, had chosen Kate as his confidante. He spent long hours talking to her about his family problems and the woman who refused to marry him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Johnny led them through the dance floor, past a few wooden tables, to the bar, where a girl with magenta hair cut into spidery spikes and a safety pin in her cheek took their orders. At the end of the bar, suspended up in the corner, was a good-sized TV that was currently tuned to MTV. No one was paying the slightest attention to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="强尼带她们穿过舞池，经过几张木桌来到吧台旁，酒保的头发染成紫红色，呈八爪形根根竖立，脸颊上别着一个安全别针。吧台尽头有个大电视挂在半空中，目前播放着MTV频道，但完全没有人在看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hallway opened into a long, rectangular room that was packed with people dressed in metal-enhanced black leather. Kate had never seen so many bizarre hairdos in one room. There were dozens of people with six-inch-long Mohawks gelled to sawblade perfection and dyed in rainbow colors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走廊尽头是一个长方形的空间，里面挤满了人，个个穿着挂满五金装饰的黑皮衣。凯蒂第一次在同一个地方看到这么多怪发型，好几十个人顶着朋克头，用发胶固定得像锯子一样挺，染成彩虹般的七彩颜色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By their third round, Tully was drunk. When the right song started --"Call Me," or "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)," or "Do You Really Wanna Hurt Me?"-- she was on her feet, dancing all by herself right next to the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喝到第三杯时，塔莉醉了。当她喜欢的摇滚乐响起，例如金发美女乐团的《呼我》[53]、英国舞韵乐团的《美梦〈就是这么做的〉》、文化俱乐部的《你真的想伤害我吗》，她就会站起来在桌子旁边独自跳舞。【注：[53] 《呼我》（Call Me）：美国摇滚乐团金发美女（Blondie）1980年作品，为理查·基尔成名电影《美国舞男》的主题曲。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully was the first to start dancing, then Johnny, and finally Kate. At first she felt awkward -- literally a third wheel -- but by the end of the song, she'd softened. The alcohol was a lubricant, making her body more fluid somehow, and when the music changed and slowed down, she barely hesitated to step into Tully and Johnny's arms. The three of them moved together with a natural ease that was surprisingly sexy. Kate stared up at Johnny, who was gazing at Tully, and she couldn't help wishing just once he'd look at her that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉率先跳起舞，接着是强尼，凯蒂最后。一开始她觉得有点不自在，名副其实是个电灯泡，但是跳完一曲后，她渐渐放松了。酒精是最好的润滑剂，让她的身体变得灵活，当音乐变成慢歌，她几乎毫不迟疑地投入塔莉与强尼的怀抱，他们三个自在地一起舞动，感觉出奇性感。凯蒂抬头看强尼，他痴痴望着塔莉，她忍不住希望他能那样看她。">查看中文翻译</div>
