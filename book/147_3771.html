<div class="line_en">Then, in the cool long glade of yard that stretched four hundred feet behind the house he planted trees and grape vines. And whatever he touched in that rich fortress of his soul sprang into golden life: as the years passed, the fruit trees -- the peach, the plum, the cherry, the apple -- grew great and bent beneath their clusters. His grape vines thickened into brawny ropes of brown and coiled down the high wire fences of his lot, and hung in a dense fabric, upon his trellises, roping his domain twice around. They climbed the porch end of the house and framed the upper windows in thick bowers. And the flowers grew in rioting glory in his yard -- the velvet-leaved nasturtium, slashed with a hundred tawny dyes, the rose, the snowball, the redcupped tulip, and the lily. The honeysuckle drooped its heavy mass upon the fence; wherever his great hands touched the earth it grew fruitful for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver married Eliza in May. After their wedding trip to Philadelphia, they returned to the house he had built for her on Woodson Street. With his great hands he had laid the foundations, burrowed out deep musty cellars in the earth, and sheeted the tall sides over with smooth trowellings of warm brown plaster. He had very little money, but his strange house grew to the rich modelling of his fantasy: when he had finished he had something which leaned to the slope of his narrow uphill yard, something with a high embracing porch in front, and warm rooms where one stepped up and down to the tackings of his whim. He built his house close to the quiet hilly street; he bedded the loamy soil with flowers; he laid the short walk to the high veranda steps with great square sheets of colored marble; he put a fence of spiked iron between his house and the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="5月里，奥利弗迎娶了伊丽莎。费城蜜月之旅结束以后，他们便返回他在伍德森大街专门为她建造的家中。他用自己那双结实有力的大手打好了房基，在地上挖了又深又潮的地窖，然后又把光滑温暖的泥浆涂抹在墙壁上。他手头并没有多少钱，但是这所奇特的房子却是凭他脑中丰富而怪诞的想象逐渐成型的。等他完工以后，自己便拥有了一座依斜坡而立的建筑。房子前面有高高的门廊环抱，里面有许多高低错落的房间，这些都是他在建造时凭灵感想象出来的模式。他把这所房子建造在安静的山路附近，并且在松软的黏土地里种上了花草，在通往走廊高台的小路上，他铺上了一块块颜色各异的大理石，在房子的周围围起了铁栅栏，把这一家和外面的世界隔离了开来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Eliza was not content with his trade: there was no money in death. People, she thought, died too slowly. And she foresaw that her brother Will, who had begun at fifteen as helper in a lumber yard, and was now the owner of a tiny business, was destined to become a rich man. So she persuaded Gant to go into partnership with Will Pentland: at the end of a year, however, his patience broke, his tortured egotism leaped from its restraint, he howled that Will, whose business hours were spent chiefly in figuring upon a dirty envelope with a stub of a pencil, paring reflectively his stubby nails, or punning endlessly with a birdlike wink and nod, would ruin them all. Will therefore quietly bought out his partner's interest, and moved on toward the accumulation of a fortune, while Oliver returned to isolation and his grimy angels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊丽莎对他的生意并不满意。她觉得，靠死人是发不了大财的，因为人们死得太慢了。在她看来，那位从小在一家木材加工场当帮工的哥哥威尔，如今已经另起炉灶，自己当起了老板，他将来一定会成为富翁的。于是她规劝甘特和威尔·彭特兰合伙做生意。然而，到了年底，甘特再也没有什么耐心了。他那种我行我素的心理意识难以容忍这种束缚，于是便大声吼叫着说，威尔这家伙上班的时候只知道拿一截铅笔头在破信封上计算什么，要么就是修剪他短而硬的手指甲，再不然就像只鸟儿似的眨巴着眼睛，搔首弄姿。再这样下去，他一定会把我们全给毁了！这样一来，威尔悄悄地把这位合伙人的股份全部卖了出去，自己则继续专注于财富的积累。而奥利弗只得再次回到他孤独的世界中，终日与那些满是灰尘的天使为伍了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For him the house was the picture of his soul, the garment of his will. But for Eliza it was a piece of property, whose value she shrewdly appraised, a beginning for her hoard. Like all the older children of Major Pentland she had, since her twentieth year, begun the slow accretion of land: from the savings of her small wage as teacher and book-agent, she had already purchased one or two pieces of earth. On one of these, a small lot at the edge of the public square, she persuaded him to build a shop. This he did with his own hands, and the labor of two negro men: it was a two-story shack of brick, with wide wooden steps, leading down to the square from a marble porch. Upon this porch, flanking the wooden doors, he placed some marbles; by the door, he put the heavy simpering figure of an angel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对他来说，这座房子就是他自己心灵的化身，是他意志的外衣。而在伊丽莎看来，这只是一块地产。她精明地计算过这块地的价值，是她投资产业的开始。伊丽莎和彭特兰少校家的其他几个年长的孩子一样，从20岁起就开始慢慢地攒钱买地。靠她当教师和推销书籍赚来的那点积蓄，她已经买下了一两块地皮。其中的一小块地位于广场的一角。她劝丈夫在那里开个店铺。于是在两个黑人的协助下，奥利弗遂了她的心愿。这家小店铺是个二层砖混结构。宽阔的木头台阶连接着大理石门廊和广场。在门廊上面，两扇木门的旁边，他堆了一些大理石料。在紧靠门的地方，他安置了一座沉重、满面傻笑的天使石像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The strange figure of Oliver Gant cast its famous shadow through the town. Men heard at night and morning the great formula of his curse to Eliza. They saw him plunge to house and shop, they saw him bent above his marbles, they saw him mould in his great hands -- with curse, and howl, with passionate devotion -- the rich texture of his home. They laughed at his wild excess of speech, of feeling, and of gesture. They were silent before the maniac fury of his sprees, which occurred almost punctually every two months, and lasted two or three days. They picked him foul and witless from the cobbles, and brought him home -- the banker, the policeman, and a burly devoted Swiss named Jannadeau, a grimy jeweller who rented a small fenced space among Gant's tombstones. And always they handled him with tender care, feeling something strange and proud and glorious lost in that drunken ruin of Babel. He was a stranger to them: no one -- not even Eliza -- ever called him by his first name. He was -- and remained thereafter --"Mister" Gant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，奥利弗·甘特这个奇怪的人物便家喻户晓了。人们每天早晚都能听见他例行公事般、大声地咒骂伊丽莎。人们看见他奔走于家与店铺之间，看见他躬身在大理石上面，一双大手忙碌地工作着——同时还大声地叫骂着，用他的那份激情支撑着人口众多的家庭。人们嘲笑他粗率的言辞、狂野的性情、粗犷的动作。可是他一旦发起酒疯，大家都默不作声。每隔两三个月，他都会发一阵酒疯，每次持续两三天。每次当他浑身污秽地醉倒在碎鹅卵石街面上时，人们就会把他抬起来送到家里去。这些人有银行家、警察，还有一位热心的瑞士人，名叫简那度，他是一位脏兮兮的钟表匠，在甘特先生的石匠铺里租了一个小间用以精修手表。他们每次都会小心谨慎地照顾他，觉得这位醉汉身上平日里具有的那种高傲和尊贵在这一刻已经荡然无存了。不管怎样，他毕竟是个异乡人，所以谁都不会直呼其名，连伊丽莎也是这样。大家都会称他为“甘特先生”。人们就一直这么称呼他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In eleven years she bore him nine children of whom six lived. The first, a girl, died in her twentieth month, of infant cholera; two more died at birth. The others outlived the grim and casual littering. The oldest, a boy, was born in 1885. He was given the name of Steve. The second, born fifteen months later, was a girl -- Daisy. The next, likewise a girl -- Helen -- came three years later. Then, in 1892, came twins -- boys -- to whom Gant, always with a zest for politics, gave the names of Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison. And the last, Luke, was born two years later, in 1894.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在过去的11年里，她一共生了9个孩子，其中有6个存活了下来。头胎是个女儿，只活了20个月，便因霍乱夭折了。另外两个刚出生就没了。其余的孩子们都是在艰苦、杂乱的环境中成长起来的。老大是个儿子，出生于1885年，名叫史蒂夫。老二是个女孩，比老大晚生了一年三个月，名叫黛西。接着又是个女儿，名叫海伦，比黛西小三岁。1892年，她又生了一对双胞胎，都是男孩。由于甘特一生醉心于政治，于是便给他们俩起了两个总统的名字，一个叫葛罗夫·克里夫兰；另一个叫本杰明·哈里逊。最小的孩子名叫卢克，出生于两年后的1894年。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And what Eliza endured in pain and fear and glory no one knew. He breathed over them all his hot lion-breath of desire and fury: when he was drunk, her white pursed face, and all the slow octopal movements of her temper, stirred him to red madness. She was at such times in real danger from his assault: she had to lock herself away from him. For from the first, deeper than love, deeper than hate, as deep as the unfleshed bones of life, an obscure and final warfare was being waged between them. Eliza wept or was silent to his curse, nagged briefly in retort to his rhetoric, gave like a punched pillow to his lunging drive -- and slowly, implacably had her way. Year by year, above his howl of protest, he did not know how, they gathered in small bits of earth, paid the hated taxes, and put the money that remained into more land. Over the wife, over the mother, the woman of property, who was like a man, walked slowly forth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有人知道伊丽莎究竟忍受了多少痛苦与恐惧，心里又有多少的荣耀和自豪。他像只狂躁的狮子，把自己的欲望和怒火倾泻在全家人面前。每次酒醉的时候，伊丽莎白皙的面容就会因生气而变得扭曲着。她那慢条斯理、不急不躁的脾气，更使他怒火中烧。每逢这样的时刻，她随时都会有挨揍的可能。因此她只好躲进屋中，把门反锁起来，防止他冲进来。因为从一开始，他们两人之间就酝酿着某种难以说清、无休无止的战争。这种战争比爱情更深、比仇恨更深，是一种深入到人性骨髓的东西。就在他破口大骂的时候，伊丽莎往往只能低声地抽泣，等到骂得实在过分的时候，她也会简短地回敬他几句。但是等他猛扑过来想要揍她的时候，她又会像个压瘪了的枕头缩了回去。这样慢慢地，他也就没什么脾气了，到头来还是她占了上风。一年一年，在不知不觉中，伴着他的咆哮和反对，他们还是买了一块又一块的土地，不停地掏钱缴纳着令人厌恶的税款，而把余下的钱再次拿去购置更多的地产。这个有产业的女人超越了妻子、母亲的角色，像个男人似的慢慢朝前迈进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eliza came through stolidly to victory. As she marched down these enormous years of love and loss, stained with the rich dyes of pain and pride and death, and with the great wild flare of his alien and passionate life, her limbs faltered in the grip of ruin, but she came on, through sickness and emaciation, to victorious strength. She knew there had been glory in it: insensate and cruel as he had often been, she remembered the enormous beating color of his life, and the lost and stricken thing in him which he would never find. And fear and a speechless pity rose in her when at times she saw the small uneasy eyes grow still and darken with the foiled and groping hunger of old frustration. O lost!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些年，伊丽莎在麻木中挺了过来。多年的爱、恨、失落都在她的脸上留下了痛苦、骄傲与死亡的印痕。在她与他完全不同、充满激情的生活中，她拼命挣扎着，尽管累弯了腰，但是她最终战胜了疾病，拖着瘦弱的躯体一路走来，而且变得越来越坚强。她完全明白这一切都体现出荣耀；虽然奥利弗总是麻木不仁、凶蛮残忍，但是她却能想起他身上的那股巨大活力，还有他心坎中永远失去而又无法复得的东西。所以，有时候她会看见他那双小眼睛一天天变得呆滞、黯然，其中满含着无尽的饥饿和无法达到的愿望。这时候，伊丽莎的内心便会涌起一份恐惧与说不出的怜悯之情。啊，失落！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Twice, during this period, at intervals of five years, Gant's periodic spree lengthened into an unbroken drunkenness that lasted for weeks. He was caught, drowning in the tides of his thirst. Each time Eliza sent him away to take a cure for alcoholism at Richmond. Once, Eliza and four of her children were sick at the same time with typhoid fever. But during a weary convalescence she pursed her lips grimly and took them off to Florida.</div>
