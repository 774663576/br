<div class="line_en">The hospital was small and private with just one entrance. Michael looked through the window down into the street. There was a curved courtyard that had steps leading down into the street and the street was empty of cars. But whoever came into the hospital would have to come through that entrance. He knew he didn't have much time so he ran out of the room and down the four flights and through the wide doors of the ground floor entrance. Off to the side he saw the ambulance yard and there was no car there, no ambulances either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医院很小，只有一道门，迈克尔从窗口俯视街道：门前有个弧形院落，院落前面有台阶通向街道；街道上空空如也，连一辆汽车也没有。看来，谁要想进这所医院，就得走这道大门。他知道时间紧迫，于是他跑出病房，直下四段楼梯，冲出宽敞的大门。旁边不远就是救护车停车场，他一看，那儿既没有一般汽车，也没有救护车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael stood on the sidewalk outside the hospital and lit a cigarette. He unbuttoned his coat and stood in the light of a lamppost so that his features could be seen. A young man was walking swiftly down from Ninth Avenue, a package under his arm. The young man wore a combat jacket and had a heavy shock of black hair. His face was familiar when he came under the lamplight but Michael could not place it. But the young man stopped in front of him and put out his hand, saying in a heavy Italian accent, "Don Michael, do you remember me? Enzo, the baker's helper to Nazorine the Paniterra; his son-in-law. Your father saved my life by getting the government to let me stay in America."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔站在医院外面的人行道上，点着一支香烟抽起来。他解开上衣钮扣，站在路灯的亮光下面。这样，他的脸就能让人看清楚，认得出来。有个年轻人从第九路走过来，走得很快，腋下夹着包东西。这个年轻人上身穿的是军服，满头浓密的乱蓬蓬的黑发。他走到灯光下面，迈克尔一看，很面熟，但记不得在哪儿见过面。这个年轻人在他面前站住了，一面伸手同迈克尔握手，一面用很重的意大利语腔调说：“迈克尔大人，您还记得我吗？我叫恩佐，原来是面包师傅纳佐林的伙计，现在是他的女婿。你爸爸设法叫政府允许我留在美国，这等于救了我的命。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael smiled and shook his head. "No, but thanks anyway. I'll tell the Don you came." A car came roaring down the street and Michael was instantly alert. He said to Enzo, "Leave here quickly. There may be trouble. You don't want to get involved with the police."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔一面微笑，一面摇头。“不让进去了，但是照样谢谢你，我回头告诉老头子，就说你来过了。”一辆汽车轰隆隆从街道那头开过来了，迈克尔立即警惕起来。他对恩佐说：“你赶快离开，这儿可能要出乱子，没有必要让警察纠缠着你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was touched. He was about to tell the young man to go away again, but then he thought, why not let him stay? Two men in front of the hospital might scare off any of Sollozzo's crew sent to do a job. One man almost certainly would not. He gave Enzo a cigarette and lit it for him. They both stood under the lamppost is the cold December night. The yellow panes of the hospital, bisected by the greens of Christmas decorations, twinkled down on them. They had almost finished their cigarettes when a long low black car turned into 30th Street from Ninth Avenue and cruised toward them, very close to the curb. It almost stopped. Michael peered to see their faces inside, his body flinching involuntarily. The car seemed about to stop, then speeded forward. Somebody had recognized him. Michael gave Enzo another cigarette and noticed that the baker's hands were shaking. To his surprise his own hands were steady.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔很感动。他正要再次劝告这个年轻人赶快离开的时候，灵机一动：干吗不让他留下呢？两个人在医院门口，足以吓跑索洛佐派来的一帮人，一个人几乎可以肯定是无能为力的。他给恩佐递过一支香烟，还给他点着火。在十二月凛冽的夜晚，他们两个在路灯下面站着，医院窗子的黄色玻璃给圣诞节的绿色装饰树枝隔得支离破碎，微光透过斑驳的玻璃窗照在他们身上。当他们快抽完香烟的时候，一辆长长的矮矮的黑色汽车从第九路拐进第三十街，向着他们开了过来，差点挨着人行道的镶边石。汽车还没有停稳，迈克尔睁大眼睛，想看看车里面的人，他自己也不由自主地畏缩起来。汽车似乎要停下来，但又冲向前去了，显然里面的人认出了他。迈克尔又递给恩佐一支香烟，发现这个面包师的手一个劲儿地颤抖。令他感到诧异的是，他自己的手却一点儿也不发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Enzo went on, "I've come to pay my respects to your father. Will they let me into the hospital so late?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恩佐接着说：“我是来向你爸爸表示敬意的。这么晚了，人家会让我进医院吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He saw the look of fear on the young Italian's face. Trouble with the police might mean being deported or refusal of citizenship. But the young man stood fast. He whispered in Italian. "If there's trouble I'll stay to help. I owe it to the Godfather."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看到这个年轻的意大利人的脸上显出了恐惧的神色。同警察闹别扭，可能意味着被遣返或取消公民资格。但是这个年轻人站在那儿一动不动，用意大利语小声说：“如果真要出了乱子，我愿意留下帮忙，我对教父应当这样表示感恩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two huge, burly policemen grabbed his arms. Another frisked him. A massive police captain, gold braid on his cap, came up the steps, his men parting respectfully to leave a path. He was a vigorous man for his girth and despite the white hair that peeked out of his cap. His face was beefy red. He came up to Michael and said harshly, "I thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up. Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个身材魁梧的警察扭住了他的胳膊。还有个警察在搜他的身。一个身材又高又大的警官，帽子上有金色镶边，走上台阶，他手下的人恭恭敬敬地闪开，让出了一条路。尽管他是个罗汉肚，帽子下边还露出了一圈自发，他行动起来还是精力充沛的。他的脸红红的，肌肉又发达，很像牛肉。他走到迈克尔跟前，粗声粗气地说：“我原来还以为你们这些流氓全都被关起来了。你到底是什么人？你在这儿干什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stayed in the street smoking for what was no more than ten minutes when suddenly the night air was split by a police siren. A patrol car made a screaming turn from Ninth Avenue and pulled up in front of the hospital. Two more squad cars followed right behind it. Suddenly the hospital entranceway was flooded with uniformed police and detectives. Michael heaved a sigh of relief. Good old Sonny must have gotten through right away. He moved forward to meet them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩在大街上抽香烟，抽了还不到十分钟，突然一阵警车的汽笛划破了沉静的夜空，一辆巡逻车从第九路急转弯，发出刺耳的喳喳声，在医院门前突然停下来。紧跟在后面的是两辆装有短波无线电话的警备车。突然之间医院大门口拥满了穿制服的警察和侦探。迈克尔如释重负地松了一口气，他走上前去迎接他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael didn't answer. He was studying this police captain, coldly searching his face, the metallic blue eyes. A detective in plain clothes said, "That's Michael Corleone, the Don's son."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔没有理睬警官提出的问题，而是仔细打量这个警官，冷静地端详着他的脸和铁青色的眼珠。一个便衣侦探说：“这就是迈克尔·考利昂，是老头子的儿子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔心平气和地说：“原来负责保卫我爸爸的侦探哪里去了？谁把他们调开了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The police captain was choleric with rage. "You fucking hood, who the hell are you to tell me my business? I pulled them off. I don't give a shit how many dago gangsters kill each other. If it was up to me, I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off. Now get the hell out of here. Get out of this street, you punk, and stay out of this hospital when it's not visiting hours."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警官听了大发雷霆：“你个该死的流氓，究竟算什么东西，居然管起我的事来了？我把他们调开了。意大利黑帮分子互相残杀，死了多少人，关我屁事。据我看，为了保卫你爸爸不被敲掉，要我动一个指头我也不愿意，现在你就滚开吧。妈的！离开这条街道，你个小阿飞，不是探望时间，就别到这个医院里来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was still studying him intently. He was not angry at what this police captain was saying. His mind was racing furiously. Was it possible that Sollozzo had been in that first car and had seen him standing in front of the hospital? Was it possible that Sollozzo had then called this captain and said, "How come the Corleones' men are still around the hospital when I paid you to lock them up?" Was it possible that all had been carefully planned as Sonny had said? Everything fitted in. Still cool, he said to the captain, "I'm not leaving this hospital until you put guards around my father's room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对这个警官的辱骂，迈克尔并没有生气。他正思考一些问题。难道索洛佐就坐在先前过去的那辆汽车里，并看到他站在医院门前？难道是索洛佐通过无线电话质问这个警官，“我花钱请你把考利昂家族的人统统关起来，你怎么搞的，医院附近还有考利昂的人？难道这一切都如桑儿所说是经过认真策划的？一切都配合得恰到好处。迈克尔仍然很冷静地对警官说：“你不布置岗哨保卫我爸爸的病房，我就不会离开这个医院。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael felt his arms pinned to his sides. He saw the captain's massive fist arching toward his face. He tried to weave away but the fist caught him high on the cheekbone. A grenade exploded in his skull. His mouth filled with blood and small hard bones that he realized were his teeth. He could feel the side of his head puff up as if it were filling with air. His legs were weightless and he would have fallen if the two policemen had not held him up. But he was still conscious. The plainclothes detective had stepped in front of him to keep the captain from hitting him again and was saying, "Jesus Christ, Captain, you really hurt him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔感到自己的胳膊被人家紧紧抓住了，动弹不得。他看到警官的大拳头向着他脸抡过来。他挣扎着想闪开，但没有来得及，拳头打在他的颊骨上，就像一颗手榴弹在他的头盖骨里面爆炸了似的。他嘴里满是血和碎骨，他明白那些碎骨就是他的牙齿打掉了。他感到自己的半边头肿胀起来，里面像充满了空气。他感到两腿轻飘飘，要不是那两个警察扶着，他早就倒下去了。但他神志还清醒。那个便衣侦探走到他面前，挡住警官，以防他再打，同时还说：“耶稣基督啊，长官，你真把他打伤了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Through a red haze Michael could see more cars pulling up to the curb. Men were getting out. One of them he recognized as Clemenza's lawyer, who was now speaking to the police captain, suavely and surely. "The Corleone Family has hired a firm of private detectives to guard Mr. Corleone. These men with me are licensed to carry firearms, Captain. If you arrest them, you'll have to appear before a judge in the morning and tell him why."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过红雾，迈克尔看到又来了几辆汽车紧挨着人行道镶边石停了下来，人也都下了汽车。他认出其中一个就是克莱门扎的律师。律师这会儿正对警官说话，语气温和而坚定。“考利昂家族已经雇了一家私营侦探公司来负责保护考利昂先生的安全。警官，跟我来的这些人都有持枪证，他们带枪是合法的。要是你逮捕他们，那么你明天一定要吃官司。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lawyer glanced at Michael. "Do you want to prefer charges against whoever did this to you?" he asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael had trouble talking. His jaws wouldn't come together but he managed to mumble. "I slipped," he said. "I slipped and fell." He saw the captain give him a triumphant glance and he tried to answer that glance with a smile. At all costs he wanted to hide the delicious icy chilliness that controlled his brain, the surge of wintry cold hatred that pervaded his body. He wanted to give no warning to anyone in this world as to how he felt at this moment. As the Don would not. Then he felt himself carried into the hospital and he lost consciousness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔说话有困难，他上下胯合不拢。但他还是勉强地说了出来：“我滑了一下，”他说，“我滑了一下就摔倒了。”他看到那个警官以胜利的神态在瞥视他；他对那样的瞥视勉强赔了个笑脸。无论如何，他也要把控制着自己头脑的愤怒和渗透着全身的严冬似的冷酷的仇恨掩饰起来。此刻的真情实感，他不想向世界上任何人发出预告。就像老头子遇到类似的情况也不会流露出自己的真情实感一样。接着他被送进医院，他晕了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

The police captain, McCluskey, is a guy who's been on the take very heavy ever since he's been a patrolman. Our Family has paid him quite a bit. And he's greedy and untrustworthy to do business with. But Sollozzo must have paid him a big price. McCluskey had all Tessio's men around and in the hospital arrested right after visiting hours. It didn't help that some of them were carrying guns. Then McCluskey pulled the official guard detectives off the Don's door. Claimed he needed them and that some other cops were supposed to go over and take their place but they got their assignments bollixed. Baloney. He was paid off to set the Don up. And Phillips said he's the kind of guy who'll try it again. Sollozzo must have given him a fortune for openers and promised him the moon to come."</div>

McCluskey has agreed to be Sollozzo's bodyguard. The Turk doesn't poke his nose out of his hole without McCluskey. When he meets Mike for the conference, McCluskey will be sitting beside him. In civilian clothes but carrying his gun. Now what you have to understand, Sonny, is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain and gotten away with it. The heat in this town would be unbearable what with the newspapers, the whole police department, the churches, everything. That would be disastrous. The Families would be after you.

<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿走过来，同他拥抱，然后说：“你同我们朝夕相处这么久，我一直都不把你放在眼里。我还要说的是：你一直都是正确的。汤姆，你有什么要说的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen shrugged. "The reasoning is solid. What makes it so is that I don't think the Turk is sincere about a deal. I think he'll still try to get at the Don. Anyway on his past performance that's how we have to figure him. So we try to get Sollozzo. We get him even if we have to get the police captain. But whoever does the job is going to get an awful lot of heat. Does it have to be Mike?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根耸耸肩，说：“他的理由是站得住脚的，之所以能够站得住脚就是因为‘土耳其人’并不诚心想搞什么交易。我看他仍然还想搞掉老头子，咱们必须根据他的过去来判断他的现在。因此咱们就得设法搞掉索洛佐，即使不得不把警官一道搞掉，咱们也得搞掉他。但是，随便谁完成这个任务，终归是要弄得群情激昂的。这个任务一定要迈克尔去完成吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny made a comical gesture, a punch, and repeated, "How do you like that?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The tension had relaxed in the room. Mike shook his head. "Sonny, I'm doing it because it's the only thing to do. I can't give Sollozzo another crack at the old man. I seem to be the only one who can get close enough to him. And I figured it out. I don't think you can get anybody else to knock off a police captain. Maybe you would do it, Sonny, but you have a wife and kids and you have to run the Family business until the old man is in shape. So that leaves me and Freddie. Freddie is in shock and out of action. Finally that leaves just me. It's all logic. The sock on the jaw had nothing to do with it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子里的紧张气氛缓和下来了，迈克尔摇摇头，说：“桑儿，我是不得已而为之的。我不忍心听任索洛佐再来袭击咱老子。看来我是唯一能够接近索洛佐的人。我全面想了一下，要敲掉一个警官，你是另外找不到人的。桑儿，也许你本人可以，但是你有妻子儿女，而且在老头子康复之前，你还得料理家族事务。因此，这个任务就只能由我和弗烈特去完成，而弗烈特现在处于休克状态，动弹不得。说来说去，这个任务给我最合适。腭骨上挨一拳同这个根本没有关系。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonny broke in curtly, "It has to be Mike. For a million different reasons. Most important they got him down as faggy. And he can do the job, I guarantee that, and that's important because this is the only shot we'll get at that sneaky bastard Turk. So now we have to figure out the best way to back him up. Tom, Clemenza, Tessio, find out where Sollozzo will take him for the conference, I don't care how much it costs. When we find that out we can figure out how we can get a weapon into his hands. Clemenza, I want you to get him a really 'safe' gun out of your collection, the 'coldest' one you got. Impossible to trace. Try to make it short barrel with a lot of blasting power. It doesn't have to be accurate. He'll be right on top of them when he uses it. Mike, as soon as you've used the gun, drop it on the floor. Don't be caught with it on you. Clemenza, tape the barrel and the trigger with that special stuff you got so he won't leave prints. Remember, Mike, we can square everything, witnesses, and so forth, but if they catch you with the gun on you we can't square that. We'll have transportation and protection and then we'll make you disappear for a nice long vacation until the heat wears off. You'll be gone a long time, Mike, but I don't want you saying good-bye to your girl friend or even calling her. After it's all over and you're out of the country I'll send her word that you're OK. Those are orders."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿直截了当地插嘴说：“看来还是迈克去才行。可以列举出一百万条理由，但最主要的是他们认定他是个窝囊废。他能够完成这个任务，这我敢担保；这是很重要的任务，因为这是咱们干掉那个‘土耳其人’的千载难逢的机会。所以咱们必须想出最好的办法来成全他。汤姆、克莱门扎、忒希奥，打听一下，看索洛佐打算把他带到什么地方去会谈。只要能打听出来，我是不惜任何代价的。等到把会谈地点打听出来之后，咱们就可以设想一下如何在中途把武器送到他手里。克莱门扎，你从你收藏的枪支中找一支真正的“安全”枪，你存货中的“最冷”的冷门货，要的是不可能追查出来的那种。枪筒子要短，爆炸力要大，准确度不必高，他开枪的时候是直接对着他的脑壳的。迈克，你一用过，就把枪丢在地板上。千万不能让人抓着你的时候，你还带着枪。克莱门扎，用你那种特制带子把枪管和扳机缠好，他的指纹也就不会留在上面了。迈克尔，你要记着，我们把什么都可以圆通过去，见证人呀什么的，但是如果人家抓着你的时候你身上带着枪，那我们就无法圆通了。我们要准备好运送和掩护，然后我们就让你失踪一个相当长的时期，等到社会上的情绪逐渐消失了之后，你再露面。迈克，你将离开很久很久，但是我不准你向你的女朋友辞行，也不准给她打电话。当你完成任务并离开了这个国家之后，我们可以给她捎个信，就说你安然无恙。以上说的这些话都是命令。">查看中文翻译</div>
