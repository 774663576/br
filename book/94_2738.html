<div class="line_en">The other five kingdoms have produced the odd fairy tale now and then of course, but none of them are anywhere near as good. In Miamas, fairy tales are still produced around the clock, lovingly handmade one by one, and only the very, very finest of them are exported. Most are only told once and then they fall flat on the ground, but the best and most beautiful of them rise from the lips of their tellers after the last words have been spoken, and then slowly hover off over the heads of the listeners, like small, shimmering paper lanterns. When night comes they are fetched by the enphants. The enphants are very small creatures with decorous hats who ride on cloud animals (the enphants, not the hats). The lanterns are gathered up by the enphants with the help of large golden nets, and then the cloud animals turn and rise up towards the sky so swiftly that even the wind has to get out of the way. And if the wind doesn't move out of the way quickly enough, the clouds transform themselves into an animal that has fingers, so the cloud animals can give the finger to the wind. (Granny always bellowed with laughter at this; it was a while before Elsa worked out why.)</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny told her about the lamentable curse of the sea-angel, and about the two princelings who waged war on each other because they were both in love with the princess of Miploris. She also talked about the princess engaged in a fight with a witch who had stolen the most valuable treasure in the Land-of-Almost-Awake from her, and she described the warriors of Mibatalos and the dancers of Mimovas and the dream hunters of Mirevas. How they all constantly bickered and nagged at each other about this or that, until the day the Chosen One from Mimovas fled the shadows that had tried to kidnap him. And how the cloud animals carried the Chosen One to Miamas and how the inhabitants of the Land-of-Almost-Awake eventually realized that there was something more important to fight for. When the shadows amassed their army and came to take the Chosen One by force, they stood united against them. Not even when the War-Without-End seemed unlikely to end in any other way than crushing defeat, not even when the kingdom of Mibatalos fell and was leveled to the ground, did the other kingdoms capitulate. Because they knew that if the shadows were allowed to take the Chosen One, it would kill all music and then the power of the imagination in the Land-of-Almost-Awake. After that there would no longer be anything left that was different. All fairy stories take their life from the fact of being different. "Only different people change the world," Granny used to say. "No one normal has ever changed a crapping thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆给她讲过海天使的可悲诅咒，以及两位年轻的王子同时爱上密普洛瑞斯公主并由此展开一场战斗。而这位公主的敌人是个女巫，她从公主那里偷走了不眠大陆上最珍贵的宝物。外婆还讲过密巴塔洛斯的战士、密莫瓦斯的舞者、密瑞瓦斯的捕梦人。他们总是为了某事争论不休，直到密莫瓦斯的天选之子从想要绑架他的暗影手中逃脱。后来云兽带着天选之子来到密阿玛斯，而不眠大陆的居民终于意识到有更重要的事情需要他们为之战斗。当暗影集结军队前来，想以武力带走天选之子时，它们受到了居民们团结一致的抵抗。即使不眠大陆在无尽战争中眼看着将惨败，即使密巴塔洛斯将被夷为平地的时候，其他王国还是没有投降。他们知道如果让暗影带走天选之子，那将扼杀不眠大陆所有的音乐，摧毁想象的力量。之后，将再也不会出现任何“与众不同”的事物。所有童话故事都是因为“与众不同”而存在。“只有与众不同的人才能改变世界，”外婆曾经这么说，“平庸的人什么屁事都改变不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa knows he's only offering to be nice. Because he has a bad conscience about seeing her so seldom and because he pities Elsa because her granny has died and because this Wednesday thing was rather sudden for him. Elsa knows this because Dad would never usually suggest doing something "fun," because Dad doesn't like having fun. Fun things make Dad nervous. One time when they were on holiday when Elsa was small, he went with Elsa and Mum to the beach, and then they had so much fun that Dad had to take two ibuprofen and lie down all afternoon for a rest at the hotel. He had too much fun once, said Mum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎知道他这么问只是出于礼貌。因为他知道自己与爱莎见面的次数太少，因为他可怜爱莎的外婆刚刚去世，因为周三来接她这件事对他来说挺突然的。爱莎全都明白，因为爸爸通常不会建议“找点儿乐子”，他不喜欢“找乐子”。“乐子”让爸爸紧张。在爱莎小时候，某次假期，他和爱莎、妈妈一起去了海滩，他们玩得特别开心，可后来爸爸却不得不吃上两颗止疼片，在酒店里躺平休息了一下午。他一次性找了太多乐子，妈妈说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“乐子嗑过头了。”爱莎说，然后妈妈大笑了好一阵子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The strange thing about Dad is that no one brings out the fun in Mum as much as he does. It's as if Mum is always the opposite pole of a battery. No one brings out order and neatness in Mum like Granny, and no one makes her as untidy and whimsical as Dad. Once when Elsa was small and Mum was talking on the phone with Dad, and Elsa kept asking, "Is it Dad? Is it Dad? Can I talk to Dad? Where is he?" Mum finally turned around and sighed dramatically: "No, you can't talk to Dad because Dad is in heaven now, Elsa!" And when Elsa went absolutely silent and just stared at her mum, Mum grinned. "Good God, I'm only joking, Elsa. He's at the supermarket."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，没人能像爸爸那样多地激发出妈妈有趣的一面。妈妈总是站在与人相反的一边。外婆使她表现出条理和整洁，而爸爸则让她变得散漫又异想天开。爱莎更小的时候，有一次妈妈和爸爸通电话，爱莎一直在旁边问：“是爸爸吗？是爸爸吗？我能和爸爸说话吗？他在哪里呀？”妈妈最后转过身，做作地叹气：“不，你不能跟爸爸说话，因为爸爸现在在天堂，爱莎！”爱莎一下子安静了，死死地盯着妈妈。妈妈笑出声：“拜托，我在开玩笑，爱莎。他在超市。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The morning after, Elsa came into the kitchen with shiny eyes when Mum was drinking coffee with loads of lactose-free milk, and when Mum, looking worried, asked why Elsa was looking so upset, Elsa replied that she had dreamed that Dad was in heaven. And then Mum went out of her mind with guilt and hugged Elsa hard, hard, hard and said sorry over and over and over, and then Elsa waited almost ten minutes before she grinned and said: "Good God, I was only joking. I dreamed he was at the supermarket."</div>

When the princess was still a child she'd wanted to play with one of the puppies while it was sleeping. She tugged its tail and it woke in a panic and bit her hand. Of course, everyone knew that the real blame lay with her parents, who had not taught her never ever to wake the wurse that's sleeping. But the princess was so afraid and her parents so angry that they had to put the blame on someone else, so they could live with themselves. For this reason the court decided to banish the wurses from the kingdom forever.

<div class="line_cn" title="那一天，无尽战争结束了。暗影们被赶到了海的对面。狼心再度消失在了森林中。但呜嘶们留了下来，直至今日，它们依旧在密普洛瑞斯担任着公主的私人护卫，驻守在她的城堡门外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time the shadows heard the thunder and felt the ground shaking, it was already too late for them. The princess rode at the front on the greatest of all wurse warriors. And that was the moment of Wolfheart's return from the forests. Maybe because Miamas was teetering on the edge of extinction and needed him more than ever. "But maybe…" Granny used to whisper into Elsa's ear when they sat on the cloud animals at night, "maybe most of all because the princess, by realizing how unjust she had been to the wurses, proved that all the kingdoms deserved to be saved."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷声滚滚、大地震动的时候，暗影们将迎来自己的末日。公主一马当先，身后是呜嘶中最勇猛的战士。那一刻狼心也从森林中归来。也许是因为密阿玛斯濒临灭亡，极度需要他的救援。“但也许…”夜晚，外婆和爱莎坐在云兽身上，外婆对她耳语，“也许最重要的原因是公主意识到她曾对呜嘶们造成的不公，证明了所有王国都应该被拯救。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa hears Our Friend barking quite madly down there now. She remembers what Granny said about how "making a racket amuses it." Elsa feels a bit unsure about Our Friend's sense of humor, but then remembers what Granny said about Our Friend not needing to live with anyone. Granny didn't live with anyone herself, of course, and when Elsa pointed out that perhaps she shouldn't compare herself to a dog, Granny rolled her eyes. Now Elsa understands why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，爱莎听见楼下“我们的朋友”在疯狂地大叫。她想起外婆说过“制造混乱令它愉悦”。爱莎不是很认同“我们的朋友”的幽默感，但又想起外婆说过“我们的朋友”不需要和别人住在一起。当然外婆自己也没有和别人同住，但爱莎曾指出也许她不该把自己和一条狗相提并论。外婆翻了个白眼。爱莎现在知道为什么了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们的朋友”安静了片刻，仿佛暂时战术性撤退，打算为真正的战斗积蓄力量。那警察手中的钥匙叮当作响，嘴上说着什么“准备好以防它攻击”。他们现在听上去多少有些自信了，因为“我们的朋友”不叫了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie interrupts, hissing at him that surely Lennart can understand that the police have more important things to get on with than drinking coffee. The police sound a little disappointed about this. Elsa sees Lennart going back up the stairs. At first he seems to consider staying on the landing, but then seems to realize this might lead to a situation of his own coffee getting cold and conclude that whatever is going on here, it could not possibly be worth a risk like that. He disappears into the flat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽打断了他，耻笑说他应该明白警察现在有比喝咖啡更重要的事情要做。警察对此似乎有点儿失望。爱莎听见莱纳特上楼回去。一开始，他好像打算留在楼梯平台上观望，但又马上意识到自己的咖啡可能因此放凉，最后决定不管这里将发生什么，都不值得冒这样的风险。于是，他离开楼道，回了房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first bark after that is short and defined. As if Our Friend is merely testing its vocal cords. The second is so loud that all Elsa can hear for several eternities is a ringing sound in her ears. When it finally ebbs away, she hears a terrific thud. Then another. And one more. Only then does she understand what the noise means. Our Friend is launching itself with all its strength at the inside of the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这之后的第一声吠叫短促清晰，仿佛“我们的朋友”只是在测试它的声带。第二声响到在“数个永恒”中，爱莎只能听见自己的耳鸣。当耳鸣终于消退，她听见一声可怕的“砰”。然后又是一声。再一声。直到此时，她才明白那声音意味着什么。“我们的朋友”正用全身的力量从里面撞着门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa hears one of the police talking on the telephone again. She can't hear most of what's being said, but she hears the words "extremely large and aggressive." She peers down through the railings and sees the police standing a few yards from the door of Our Friend's flat, their self-confidence dwindling as Our Friend throws itself at the door with increasing force. Two more police have turned up, Elsa notices. One of them has brought a German Shepherd on a leash. The German Shepherd doesn't seem to think it's a terrific idea to go wherever that thing, whatever it is, is trying to get out. It watches its handler a little like Elsa looked at Granny that time she tried to rewire Mum's microwave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎听见一位警察又开始打电话。她听不清到底说了些什么，只有断续的字词，例如“极度庞大且有攻击性”。她透过栏杆向下张望，看见警察站在离“我们的朋友”门口几米外，当“我们的朋友”撞击门的声音越来越响时，他们的自信心也越来越少。爱莎注意到又出现了两名警察，其中一人用皮带牵着一条德国牧羊犬。这只牧羊犬似乎固执地认为，到那个未知生物随时可能夺门而出的地方去不是个好主意。它看着主人，就像外婆给妈妈的微波炉更换电线时爱莎看外婆的眼神。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Our Friend barks one last time, horrifyingly loud. Then grows silent again. There's a lot of noise on the stairs for a moment, and then Elsa hears the main entrance door closing. The police have clearly decided to wait farther away from whatever is living in that flat, until Animal Control gets there. Elsa watches through the window as they make off, something in their body language suggesting coffee. Whereas the German Shepherd has something in its body language that suggests it is considering early retirement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们的朋友”最后吠了一声，震撼人心。然后又安静了。楼梯处嘈杂了好一阵，随后爱莎听见正门关上的声音。警察显然决定在离那公寓远一点儿的地方等待动物管控中心的人来，不管公寓里面住的是什么。爱莎透过窗户看着他们落荒而逃，肢体语言表示他们迫切需要喝杯咖啡。而那只德国牧羊犬的肢体语言显示出它在考虑提早退休。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Call in Animal Control, then," Elsa hears the policewoman with green eyes saying, at last, with a disconsolate sigh.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa stands there of two minds. (She knows that "of two minds" is a phrase for the word jar.) She can see the police through the window, and in retrospect Elsa will not be able to explain exactly why she does it. But no true knight of Miamas could stand and watch a friend of Granny's being killed without trying to do something about it. So she quickly sneaks down the stairs, taking extra care as she passes Britt-Marie and Kent's flat, and taking the precaution of stopping on every half-landing to listen and make sure the police are not coming back in.</div>

She hears a sound made by a paw the size of a car tire, quickly scraping the inside of the door.</div>
