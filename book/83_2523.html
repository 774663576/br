<div class="line_en">"You'll get it. Joe and I were out riding Foothill Boulevard Sunday before last. It was late and the lights coming up and the usual mess of cars. We passed a brown coupe and I saw the girl who was driving it. There was a man beside her, a dark short man. The girl was a blonde. I'd seen her before. She was Eddie Mars' wife. The guy was Canino. You wouldn't forget either of them, if you ever saw them. Joe tailed the coupe from in front. He was good at that. Canino, the watchdog, was taking her out for air. A mile or so east of Realito a road turns towards the foothills. That's orange country to the south but to the north it's as bare as hell's back yard and smack up against the hills there's a cyanide plant where they make the stuff for fumigation. Just off the highway there's a small garage and paintshop run by a gee named Art Huck. Hot car drop, likely. There's a frame house beyond this, and beyond the house nothing but the foothills and the bare stone outcrop and the cyanide plant a couple of miles on. That's the place where she's holed up. They turned off on this road and Joe swung around and went back and we saw the car turn off the road where the frame house was. We sat there half an hour looking through the cars going by. Nobody came back out. When it was quite dark Joe sneaked up there and took a look. He said there were lights in the house and a radio was going and just the one car out in front, the coupe. So we beat it."</div>

<div class="line_en">The motor of the gray Plymouth throbbed under her voice and the rain pounded above it. The violet light at the top of Bullock's green-tinged tower was far above us, serene and withdrawn from the dark, dripping city. Her black-gloved hand reached out and I put the bills in it. She bent over to count them under the dim light of the dash. A bag clicked open, clicked shut. She let a spent breath die on her lips. She leaned towards me.</div>

The sound of its motor died, and with it blonde Agnes wiped herself off the slate for good, so far as I was concerned. Three men dead, Geiger, Brody and Harry Jones, and the woman went riding off in the rain with my two hundred in her bag and not a mark on her. I kicked my starter and drove on downtown to eat. I ate a good dinner. Forty miles in the rain is a hike, and I hoped to make it a round trip.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cars passed with a tearing hiss and a wave of dirty spray. The highway jerked through a little town that was all packing houses and sheds, and railway sidings nuzzling them. The groves thinned out and dropped away to the south and the road climbed and it was cold and to the north the black foothills crouched closer and sent a bitter wind whipping down their flanks. Then faintly out of the dark two yellow vapor lights glowed high up in the air and a neon sign between them said: "Welcome to Realito."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往来车辆发出撕心裂肺的嘶嘶声，溅起污秽的泥浆水。汽车颠簸着经过一个小镇，四处尽是屠宰场和牲口棚，铁道的岔线穿梭其间。果林渐渐稀疏，越往南橘树越少，路面徐徐上升，气温转冷，北边，蜷伏的黑色丘陵离得更近了，凛冽的寒风从山麓两侧猛扫下来。过了一会儿，黑暗里依稀出现黄色的亮光，原来是两盏蒸汽灯高悬在半空中，中间有块霓虹标牌：“欢迎来到里阿利特。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fate stage-managed the whole thing. Beyond Realito, just about a mile beyond, the highway took a curve and the rain fooled me and I went too close to the shoulder. My right front tire let go with an angry hiss. Before I could stop the right rear went with it. I jammed the car to a stop, half on the pavement, half on the shoulder, got out and flashed a spotlight around. I had two flats and one spare. The flat butt of a heavy galvanized tack stared at me from the front tire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="命运主导了整台戏。出了里阿利特，刚过大约一英里，开进一个弯道时我上了大雨的当，跟路肩靠得太近了。伴随着一声尖利的狂啸，我的右前胎爆了。我还没来得及刹车，右后胎也爆了。车在我的紧急制动下停了，一半在人行道上，一半在路肩上，我钻了出来，打开手电照了照。两个轮胎瘪了，可备胎只有一个。赫然出现在前胎上的，是一只大号镀锌图钉扁平的屁股。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frame houses were spaced far back from a wide main street, then a sudden knot of stores, the lights of a drugstore behind fogged glass, the fly-cluster of cars in front of the movie theater, a dark bank on a corner with a clock sticking out over the sidewalk and a group of people standing in the rain looking at its windows, as if they were some kind of a show. I went on. Empty fields closed in again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些木板房和一条宽阔的主干道远远相隔，接着突然出现了一堆店铺，透过起雾的车玻璃，我看到一爿杂货店亮着几盏灯。电影院门口的车停得跟一窝苍蝇似的，街角有家黑魆魆的银行，装了一台时钟突在人行道上方，人群站在雨里看着窗户，好像里面在演戏一样。我继续赶路。旷野再次包围了我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I snapped the flash off and stood there breathing rain and looking up a side road at a yellow light. It seemed to come from a skylight. The skylight could belong to a garage, the garage could be run by a man named Art Huck, and there could be a frame house next door to it. I tucked my chin down in my collar and started towards it, then went back to unstrap the license holder from the steering post and put it in my pocket. I leaned lower under the wheel. Behind a weighted flap, directly under my right leg as I sat in the car, there was a hidden compartment. There were two guns in it. One belonged to Eddie Mars' boy Lanny and one belonged to me. I took Lanny's. It would have had more practice than mine. I stuck it nose down in an inside pocket and started up the side road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我“啪嗒”关上手电，站在那儿，吸进呼出的尽是雨水，一边看着一条旁路深处的黄色灯光。那灯光似乎是从天窗里透出来的。那天窗或许是一间修车厂屋顶上的，那修车厂的老板或许名叫阿尔特·哈克，厂子隔壁或许是幢木板房。我一缩脖子，把下巴塞进衣领，朝那亮光走去，接着又回到车上从挡杆上解下证件夹，放进口袋。我屈了屈身，探进方向盘下面。在一块特意加重的活板后面，当我坐在驾驶座上时正好在右腿下方的位置，有一个暗箱。里面放着两把枪。一把是艾迪·马尔斯的跟班莱尼的，另一把是我的。我拿了莱尼那把。它应该比我那把更有实战经验。我把它枪口朝下塞进内袋里，踏上那条旁路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The garage was a hundred yards from the highway. It showed the highway a blank side wall. I played the flash on it quickly. "Art Huck -- Auto Repairs and Painting." I chuckled, then Harry Jones' face rose up in front of me, and I stopped chuckling. The garage doors were shut, but there was an edge of light under them and a thread of light where the halves met. I went on past. The frame house was there, light in two front windows, shades down. It was set well back from the road, behind a thin clump of trees. A car stood on the gravel drive in front. It was dark, indistinct, but it would be a brown coupe and it would belong to Mr. Canino. It squatted there peacefully in front of the narrow wooden porch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那间修车厂离公路大约一百码。正对公路的是一堵空白的侧墙。我用手电光飞快地一扫。“阿尔特·哈克——汽车修理和上漆。”我不禁暗笑，可这时眼前浮现起哈利·琼斯的脸，我笑不出来了。修车厂的门关着，但底下隐隐有一道光晕，两半门的中缝里也有一线亮光。我继续走过去。果然有幢木板房，正面的两扇窗户里有灯光，遮着窗帘。那房子跟公路离得很远，建在一片稀疏的树丛后面。门前的砾石车道上停着一辆车。车黑黢黢的，看不太清楚，但那或许是辆棕色的小轿车，属于卡尼诺先生。它蛰伏于此，平静地停在狭长的木头门廊前面。">查看中文翻译</div>

I stood there grinning and licking the rain off my lip. I clicked the spot on the middle of the doors. I grinned at the circle of white. I was where I wanted to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">He would let her take it out for a spin once in a while, and sit beside her, probably with a gun handy. The girl Rusty Regan ought to have married, that Eddie Mars couldn't keep, the girl that hadn't run away with Regan. Nice Mr. Canino.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't like that. I kicked the door hard. I kept on kicking it. Another voice made itself heard, a purring voice, like a small dynamo behind a wall. I liked this voice. It said: "A wise guy, huh? Open up, Art."</div>

<div class="line_en">He went out silently, leaving the door yawning. The rain blustered in. The man in brown strolled over and shut it and strolled back to the workbench and put his hips exactly where they had been before. I could have taken him then. We were alone. He didn't know who I was. He looked at me lightly and threw his cigarette on the cement floor and stamped on it without looking down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他悄然走了出去，门都没关好。大雨倾泻进来。棕色衣服的男人信步走过去关上门，又信步走回工作台前，落座的位置跟起身前完全一样。此时我本可以拿下他。只剩下我俩。他不知道我是谁。他满不在乎地瞥了我一眼，把香烟头扔在水泥地上，看也不看就踩了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The brown man moved his eyes, looked at Art with a soft quiet-eyed stare, lowered them again almost shyly. He didn't speak. Art rocked as if a gust of wind had hit him. He stamped over to the corner and put a rubber coat over his coveralls, a sou'wester on his head. He grabbed a socket wrench and a hand jack and wheeled a dolly jack over to the doors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="棕色衣服的男人眼珠子一动，温和平静地注视着他，随后近乎羞涩地垂下了眼睛。他没说话。阿尔特像受到了一阵劲风吹拂一般，剧烈摇晃起来。他大步走到屋角，在工作服的外面套上一件橡胶雨衣，戴上雨帽。他抓起一把套筒扳手和一个小千斤顶，又推着一台千斤顶朝门口走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I bet you could use a drink," he said. "Wet the inside and even up." He reached a bottle from the workbench behind him and set it on the edge and set two glasses beside it. He poured a stiff jolt into each and held one out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你应该喝一杯，”他说，“把身体里面也弄湿，就扯平啦。”他从身后的工作台里拿出一瓶酒，搁在台子边缘，又在酒瓶旁边放了两个玻璃杯。他给两个杯子分别倒上一点烈酒，把一杯递过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Partly," I said. I walked over to the half-painted sedan with the big metal paint gun lying along its fender. The rain hit the flat roof hard. Art was out in it, cursing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不完全是。”我说。我走到那辆挡泥板上放着一把大型金属漆枪、漆才上了一半的轿车前。雨点重重拍打着平坦的屋顶。阿尔特冒雨一边走，一边咒骂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sniffed my drink delicately. It had the right smell. I watched him drink some of his before I swallowed mine. I rolled it around on my tongue. There was no cyanide in it. I emptied the little glass and put it down beside him and moved away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我细心嗅了嗅那杯酒。味道是对的。看他先喝了一点我才动杯子。我翻卷着舌头辨别滋味。酒里没有氰化物。我喝完了那一小杯酒，把杯子放到他旁边，走了开去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I said: "There's only one that's older." My lips felt dry. I didn't want to talk. I lit a cigarette. I wanted my tires fixed. The minutes passed on tiptoe.

<div class="line_en">Feet crunched outside and the door was pushed open. The light hit pencils of rain and made silver wires of them. Art trundled two muddy flats in sullenly, kicked the door shut, let one of the flats fall over on its side. He looked at me savagely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋外传来吱嘎吱嘎的脚步声，门被推开了。灯光打亮了连绵不断的雨滴，将它们映照成了银色的千丝万缕。阿尔特闷闷不乐地把两个沾满泥浆的瘪胎滚进屋，踹上门，放手让一个轮胎翻倒在地。他凶恶地看着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stood watching the roll of wrapped coins dance in Canino's hand. The moment of crouched intensity had left me. I turned my head and watched the gaunt mechanic beside me toss the air-stiffened tube up and catch it with his hands wide, one on each side of the tube. He looked it over sourly, glanced at a big galvanized tub of dirty water in the corner and grunted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站在那儿，看着那卷镍币在卡尼诺的手里上下起舞。浑身紧绷的紧张时刻已经过去，我放松了警惕。我转过头，看着身旁那个瘦削的机修工抬起鼓胀的内胎，撑开双臂，一只手握着一边。他烦躁地端详着内胎，瞥了一眼屋角那个镀锌大桶里的脏水，咕哝了两句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yah!" Art peeled his rubber coat and sou'wester off and threw them away from him. He heaved one tire up on a spreader and tore the rim loose viciously. He had the tube out and cold-patched in nothing flat. Still scowling, he strode over to the wall beside me and grabbed an air hose, put enough air into the tube to give it body and let the nozzle of the air hose smack against the whitewashed wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唷！”阿尔特脱掉橡胶雨衣，摘掉雨帽，扔向一旁。他把一只轮胎举到支架上，恶狠狠地卸掉辋圈。他拆下内胎，迅速补好。他还是闷闷不乐的，大步走到我身旁的墙前，抓起一根软管给内胎充入足量空气，看胎形恢复了，他扯开管子，任由管嘴甩在粉刷过的墙壁上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The brown man came almost dancing towards me across the floor. His hand tightened over the roll of nickels. He came up to me without sound, without expression. I bent forward and tried to heave Art off his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="棕色衣服的男人几乎是跳着穿过房间向我走来的。他握紧了手里那卷镍币。他悄然无声来到我面前，也没有表情。我俯身前倾，试图抱起阿尔特。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He jumped behind me and leaned hard on the rubber. His weight dragged on my chest, pinned my upper arms tight to my sides. I could move my hands, but I couldn't reach the gun in my pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他跃到我身后，重重压在橡胶内胎上。他用全身的重量绷住我的胸腔，把我的上臂夹紧在身侧。我的手还能动，却没法够到口袋里的枪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fist with the weighted tube inside it went through my spread hands like a stone through a cloud of dust. I had the stunned moment of shock when the lights danced and the visible world went out of focus but was still there. He hit me again. There was no sensation in my head. The bright glare got brighter. There was nothing but hard aching white light. Then there was darkness in which something red wriggled like a germ under a microscope. Then there was nothing bright or wriggling, just darkness and emptiness and a rushing wind and a falling as of great trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，握着那卷沉甸甸的镍币的拳头穿过了我摊开的手掌，仿佛一块石头穿透一团灰尘。只见灯光乱晃，眼前的世界虽然没有消失，却模糊不清起来，刹那间我吓呆了。他又打了我一下。我脑袋里没了知觉。那道白光更明亮了。除了极度刺眼的白光，什么都没有。接着是一片黑暗，黑暗里有个红色的东西像条显微镜下的细菌般在蠕动。随后明亮的或蠕动的东西都没了，只剩下黑暗，空无，一股劲风，还有仿若大树纷纷倒地的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The teamwork must have been very nice. I saw no signal, no glance of meaning, no gesture that might have a special import. The gaunt man had the stiffened tube high in the air, staring at it. He half turned his body, took one long quick step, and slammed it down over my head and shoulders, a perfect ringer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩配合得一定非常出色。我没看到暗号，没看到意味深长的眼色，也没看到疑似带有特殊含义的手势。那瘦子把鼓胀的内胎高高举起，注视着。他转过半个身子，快速向前跨了一大步，猛地把内胎套过我的头和肩膀——套环正中目标。">查看中文翻译</div>
