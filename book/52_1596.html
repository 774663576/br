<div class="line_en">All I was doing was trying to keep Peeta and myself alive. Any act of rebellion was purely coincidental. But when the Capitol decrees that only one tribute can live and you have the audacity to challenge it, I guess that's a rebellion in itself. My only defense was pretending that I was driven insane by a passionate love for Peeta. So we were both allowed to live. To be crowned victors. To go home and celebrate and wave good-bye to the cameras and be left alone. Until now.</div>

<div class="line_en">In my mind, President Snow should be viewed in front of marble pillars hung with oversized flags. It's jarring to see him surrounded by the ordinary objects in the room. Like taking the lid off a pot and finding a fanged viper instead of stew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我印象中，斯诺总统应该出现在华丽的厅堂里，身后有大理石柱，四周挂满巨大的旗帜。当他出现在普通人家时，周围的一切与他显得那么不谐调，就如同揭开锅盖看到的不是炖肉而是毒蛇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What could he be doing here? My mind rushes back to the opening days of other Victory Tours. I remember seeing the winning tributes with their mentors and stylists. Even some high government officials have made appearances occasionally. But I have never seen President Snow. He attends celebrations in the Capitol. Period.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他到这里干什么呢？我迅速回想着以往的胜利巡演开幕式，以前在开幕式上出现的有获胜者和他们的指导老师、造型师，偶尔一些高层的政府官员也会露面，但我从没见过斯诺总统，他总是在凯匹特参加欢庆仪式。没错，是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If he's made the journey all the way from his city, it can only mean one thing. I'm in serious trouble. And if I am, so is my family. A shiver goes through me when I think of the proximity of my mother and sister to this man who despises me. Will always despise me. Because I outsmarted his sadistic Hunger Games, made the Capitol look foolish, and consequently undermined his control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他千里迢迢从凯匹特赶来，这只意味着一件事：我陷入了巨大的麻烦。如果我有麻烦，家人也会有麻烦。想到妈妈和波丽姆就在这个痛恨我的人触手可及的地方，我不禁打了个寒战。是的，他会永远痛恨我，因为我在残酷的饥饿游戏中智胜，让凯匹特丢了脸，让他们的掌控失灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">President Snow smiles and I notice his lips for the first time. I'm expecting snake lips, which is to say none. But his are overly full, the skin stretched too tight. I have to wonder if his mouth has been altered to make him more appealing. If so, it was a waste of time and money, because he's not appealing at all. "My advisors were concerned you would be difficult, but you're not planning on being difficult, are you?" he asks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯诺总统微笑着，这时我才第一次注意到他的嘴唇，我本想自己会看到蛇一样的嘴唇，也就是说看不到嘴唇，但我真正看到的却是饱满而紧实的嘴唇。我纳闷他是否为了让自己更有吸引力而做过唇部整形。如果真是这样，那简直是浪费时间和金钱，因为他一点也不吸引人。“我的顾问担心你很难对付，事实上你没有准备这么做，对吧？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps it is the newness of the house or the shock of seeing him or the mutual understanding that he could have me killed in a second that makes me feel like the intruder. As if this is his home and I'm the uninvited party. So I don't welcome him or offer him a chair. I don't say anything. In fact, I treat him as if he's a real snake, the venomous kind. I stand motionless, my eyes locked o him, considering plans of retreat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是对这个房间比较陌生，也许是看到他后太震惊了，也许我们俩心里都清楚他可以在瞬间置我于死地，我感觉好像这是在他家里，而我是未被邀请的闯入者。因此，我没有欢迎他也没给他让座，只是一言不发。事实上，我把他当作真正的蛇来看待，一条毒蛇。我站着一动不动，眼睛直视着他，盘算着下一步该怎么办。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“如果赛组委主席塞内卡克林稍微有点脑子，他当时就该让你们两个灰飞烟灭，可不幸的是，他感情脆弱，所以你没有死，现在仍站在这里。你能猜猜他到哪儿去了？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"After that, there was nothing to do but let you play out your little scenario. And you were pretty good, too, with the love-crazed schoolgirl bit. The people in the Capitol were quite convinced. Unfortunately, not everyone in the districts fell for your act," he says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“此后，我们毫无办法，只好让你继续演出你的小闹剧。你演得还不错，啊？那个痴情的小女生，凯匹特人对此深信不疑。可不幸的是，并非每个区的每个人都信你那一套。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I nod because, by the way he says it, it's clear that Seneca Crane has been executed. The smell of roses and blood has grown stronger now that only a desk separates us. There's a rose in President Snow's lapel, which at least suggests a source of the flower perfume, but it must be genetically enhanced, because no real rose reeks like that. As for the blood… I don't know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我点点头，从他说话的语气可以判断塞内卡·克林已经被处死了。现在我和总统之间只隔着一张桌子，玫瑰和血腥的混合气味更加浓烈。斯诺总统的衣袋里别着一枝玫瑰，散发出浓浓的玫瑰异香。这枝玫瑰一定是转基因玫瑰，因为自然生长的玫瑰不会如此芬芳。至于血腥味来自哪里…我不得而知。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This, of course, you don't know. You have no access to information about the mood in other districts. In several of them, however, people viewed your little trick with the berries as an act of defiance, not an act of love.

<div class="line_en">"Not yet. But they'll follow if the course of things doesn't change. And uprisings have been known to lead to revolution." President Snow rubs a spot over his left eyebrow, the very spot where I myself get headaches. "Do you have any idea what that would mean? How many people would die? What conditions those left would have to face? Whatever problems anyone may have with the Capitol, believe me when I say that if it released its grip on the districts for even a short time, the entire system would collapse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还没有。但事情就这么发展下去的话，他们就会紧随其后，而有暴动就可能会有革命啊。”斯诺总统用手指按住左侧眼眉的一点，轻轻地揉着，而在我头部的这个位置，也常常会感到头痛。“你是否想过这意味着什么？有多少人会为此丧命？没死的人又会有怎样的处境？无论什么人认为凯匹特存在怎样的问题，请相信我，只要我们稍一松懈，整个的社会体系就会土崩瓦解。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Surely they haven't been tracking us in there. Or have they? Could we have been followed? That seems impossible. At least by a person. Cameras? That never crossed my mind until this moment. The woods have always been our place of safety, our place beyond the reach of the Capitol, where we're free to say what we feel, be who we are. At least before the Games. If we've been watched since, what have they seen? Two people hunting, saying treasonous things against the Capitol, yes. But not two people in love, which seems to be President Snow's implication.

After a few weeks, things finally died down. The camera crews and reporters packed up and went home. Peeta and I assumed the cool relationship we've had ever since. My family settled into our house in the Victor's Village. The everyday life of District 12 -- workers to the mines, kids to school -- resumed its usual pace.

A banquet for the victors that only the most high-ranking people were invited to. A holiday for the whole district with free food and entertainers brought in from the Capitol. Parcel Day, the first of twelve, in which food packages were delivered to every person in the district. That was my favorite. To see all those hungry kids in the Seam running around, waving cans of applesauce, tins of meat, even candy. Back home, too big to carry, would be bags of grain, cans of oil. To know that once a month for a year they would all receive another parcel. That was one of the few times I actually felt good about winning the Games.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我和皮塔回到十二区以后，我连续几个星期都没有单独见过盖尔，因为有很多必须举办的庆祝活动。首先是只有高层人士才被邀请参加的庆功宴，另外，全区的人可以享受假期，假期里可以享用充足的食物，还有凯匹特派来的演员为大家表演。再有就是“礼包节”，这是十二个“礼包节”中的第一个，每个人都可以收到装满食物的礼包，这也是我最喜欢的节日。在这样的日子“夹缝地带”挨饿的穷孩子们手里都可以拿到苹果酱、肉罐头、甚至糖果。在他们的家里也有礼物，那就是成袋谷物和成桶的食用油。他们在一年中的每个月都会收到这样的礼物，这也是我赢得比赛以后感觉最好的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The weather was still warm enough that I didn't need a jacket. I packed along a bag filled with special foods, cold chicken and cheese and bakery bread and oranges. Down at my old house, I put on my hunting boots. As usual, the fence was not charged and it was simple to slip into the woods and retrieve my bow and arrows. I went to our place, Gale's and mine, where we had shared breakfast the morning of the reaping that sent me into the Games.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气仍然很暖和，所以我不需要穿夹克。我在一个大包里装了许多好吃的，有冻鸡、奶酪，烤面包和橘子。在旧家里，我换上了靴子。和往常一样，隔离网没有通电，我很容易就爬了过去，在树洞里找到弓箭。我来到我们通常会面的地点，就是在收获节那天早上分食早餐的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I waited at least two hours. I'd begun to think that he'd given up on me in the weeks that had passed. Or that he no longer cared about me. Hated me even. And the idea of losing him forever, my best friend, the only person I'd ever trusted with my secrets, was so painful I couldn't stand it. Not on top of everything else that had happened. I could feel my eyes tearing up and my throat starting to close the way it does when I get upset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我等了至少两个小时。在等待中，我慢慢觉得，经过过去的这几周，他已经放弃了再和我见面的想法，他已经不再在乎我了，甚至开始恨我。一想到要失去他，失去自己最好的朋友、我唯一可以对之敞开心扉的人，我感到难以忍受的痛苦，这痛苦超过了我所经历的一切不幸。泪水模糊了我的眼帘，我的心头堵得难受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I looked up and there he was, ten feet away, just watching me. Without even thinking, I jumped up and threw my arms around him, making some weird sound that combined laughing, choking, and crying. He was holding me so tightly that I couldn't see his face, but it was a really long time before he let me go and then he didn't have much choice, because I'd gotten this unbelievably loud case of the hiccups and had to get a drink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我抬起头时，却看到他就站在那里，在离我十英尺远的地方，正看着我。我想都不想，一下子跳起来，扑到他的怀里，又是哭又是笑，激动无比。他紧紧地抱着我，致使我连他的脸都看不到。他久久地抱着我不肯松开，最后要不是因为我不可思议地大声打嗝，需要喝水，他还把我搂在怀里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was completely unprepared. You would think that after all the hours I'd spent with Gale -- watching him talk and laugh and frown -- that I would know all there was to know about his lips. But I hadn't imagined how warm they would feel pressed against my own. Or how those hands, which could set the most intricate of snares, could as easily entrap me. I think I made some sort of noise in the back of my throat, and I vaguely remember my fingers, curled tightly closed, resting on his chest. Then he let go and said, "I had to do that. At least once." And he was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我完全没有准备。我一整天都看着他说话、大笑、皱眉，我想我对他的嘴唇已经很熟悉了。可当他用他的嘴唇贴近我的嘴唇时，却没有想到是那么的温润，我也不曾想到这双灵巧的下套的手，也能轻易地将我捕捉。我记得当时我喉咙里发出了轻微的喘息声，依稀记得自己的手指卷曲着，放在他的胸前。随后他放开我说：“我不得不这么做，至少这一次。”然后他就走开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We did what we always did that day. Ate breakfast. Hunted and fished and gathered. Talked about people in town. But not about us, his new life in the mines, my time in the arena. Just about other things. By the time we were at the hole in the fence that's nearest the Hob, I think I really believed that things could be the same. That we could go on as we always had. I'd given all the game to Gale to trade since we had so much food now. I told him I'd skip the Hob, even though I was looking forward to going there, because my mother and sister didn't even know I'd gone hunting and they'd be wondering where I was. Then suddenly, as I was suggesting I take over the daily snare run, he took my face in his hands and kissed me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the fact that the sun was setting and my family would be worried, I sat by a tree next to the fence. I tried to decide how I felt about the kiss, if I had liked it or resented it, but all I really remembered was the pressure of Gale's lips and the scent of the oranges that still lingered on his skin. It was pointless comparing it with the many kisses I'd exchanged with Peeta. I still hadn't figured out if any of those counted. Finally I went home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管此时太阳就要落山了，家人一定在为我着急，但我还是在隔离网旁的一棵树下坐下来，回味着我对他的吻的感觉，我是喜欢呢，还是厌恶，但我能记起的只是盖尔用力压在我唇上的感觉，再有就是留在他皮肤上的橘子味。把他的吻和皮塔的无数的吻相比较毫无意义，我仍然不知道在这些吻中哪一个最有分量。最后，我回家了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That week I managed the snares and dropped off the meat with Hazelle. But I didn't see Gale until Sunday. I had this whole speech worked out, about how I didn't want a boyfriend and never planned on marrying, but I didn't end up using it. Gale acted as if the kiss had never happened. Maybe he was waiting for me to say something. Or kiss him back. Instead I just pretended it had never happened, either. But it had. Gale had shattered some invisible barrier between us and, with it, any hope I had of resuming our old, uncomplicated friendship. Whatever I pretended, I could never look at his lips in quite the same way.</div>

How stupid I've been to think the Capitol would just ignore me once I'd returned home! Maybe I didn't know about the potential uprisings. But I knew they were angry with me. Instead of acting with the extreme caution the situation called for, what have I done? From the president's point of view, I've ignored Peeta and flaunted my preference for Gale's company before the whole district. And by doing so made it clear I was, in fact, mocking the Capitol.
