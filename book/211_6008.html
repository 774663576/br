<div class="line_cn" title="在和她同乘一辆车的旅客中间，有一个人对她说的话比先前的一些人说的话更直截了当：“唉呀，你简直变成了一束花了！这还在六月初呀，就有这么多好看的玫瑰花了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross, and inattentively waited to take her seat in the van returning from Chaseborough to Shaston. She did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered, though she answered them; and when they had started anew she rode along with an inward and not an outward eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝下了山，走到特兰里奇十字路口，漫不经心地在那儿等着搭乘从猎苑回沙斯顿的马车。她上车的时候，车里其他的乘客同她说话，她虽然也回答了他们，但并不知道他们说了些什么；他们乘坐的马车又接着上路了，苔丝一路上沉浸在内心的回忆中，对车外的一切视若无睹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised vision: roses at her breast; roses in her hat; roses and strawberries in her basket to the brim. She blushed, and said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her. When the passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket, where she covered them with her handkerchief. Then she fell to reflecting again, and in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin. Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions; she thought this an ill omen -- the first she had noticed that day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，她终于意识到在他们惊异的目光里，她表现出来的是怎样一种滑稽的情形了：胸前戴着玫瑰花；帽子上插着玫瑰花；篮子里也装满了玫瑰花和草莓。她不禁满脸通红，含含糊糊地告诉他们玫瑰花是别人送给她的。在乘客们不再注意她的时候，她就偷偷地把帽子上特别显眼的玫瑰花取下来，放在篮子里，用她的手巾遮盖起来。然后她又陷入了沉思，有一次她低头向下看时，她的下巴被她戴在胸前的玫瑰花刺扎了一下。像布莱克莫尔谷所有的村民一样，苔丝的头脑里充满了无稽的幻想，尽是相信预兆的迷信；她心里想，被玫瑰花刺扎了，这不是一个好兆头——这是那天她注意到的第一个预兆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="一个星期里，她都在附近的地方寻找一个轻松一点儿的工作，但是她没有找到。一个星期过去了，她在晚上回到家里。她原来的想法是要在夏季里挣一笔钱，再买一匹马。她还没有跨进门，就有一个孩子从屋里跳着跑出来说：“那个绅士到家里来过啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of her person. Mrs d'Urberville's son had called on horseback, having been riding by chance in the direction of Marlott. He had wished to know, finally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really come to manage the old lady's fowl farm or not; the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy. 'Mr d'Urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you appear; he knows you must be worth your weight in gold. He is very much interested in 'ee -- truth to tell.' Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such high opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had sunk so low.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她母亲赶忙向她解释，浑身上下都透露出笑意来。德贝维尔夫人的儿子骑马刚好路过马洛特村，就顺道来拜访他们。他主要是代表他的母亲来的，想问一问苔丝究竟愿不愿意去为老夫人管理鸡场；还说以前为她管鸡的小伙子不可靠。“德贝维尔先生说，从你的模样看起来，你肯定是个好姑娘；他说你身价如金啦。他对你很感兴趣——老实告诉你。”听说自己得到一个陌生人如此高的评价，苔丝一时似乎真的高兴起来，因为那时候她自己觉得情绪非常低落。">查看中文翻译</div>
