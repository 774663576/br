<div class="line_en">Lieutenant Chartrand stood outside the Pope's office and sensed in the uneasy stance of the soldier standing with him that they shared the same anxiety. The private meeting they were shielding, Rocher had said, could save the Vatican from destruction. So Chartrand wondered why his protective instincts were tingling. And why was Rocher acting so strangely?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏特朗中尉站在教宗办公室外头，从站在他旁边其他卫兵的不安姿势中，他感觉得到他们也同样焦虑。罗榭已经说过，他们现在所保护的这场私人会面，将可以挽救梵蒂冈免于毁灭。所以夏特朗不明白自己为什麽会有一股强烈的保护本能。而且为什麽罗榭表现得那麽奇怪？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Captain Rocher stood to Chartrand's right, staring dead ahead, his sharp gaze uncharacteristically distant. Chartrand barely recognized the captain. Rocher had not been himself in the last hour. His decisions made no sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗榭上尉站在夏特朗右边，直直瞪著前方，凌厉的眼光异常冷漠，夏特朗简直都不认得了。过去一小时罗榭完全变了个人，他的那些决定实在是没道理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something definitely was awry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一定是有什麽出错了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone should be present inside this meeting! Chartrand thought. He had heard Maximilian Kohler bolt the door after he entered. Why had Rocher permitted this?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场会面应该要有人进去陪著才对！夏特朗心想。他听到麦斯米伦．寇勒进去后闩上了门。为什麽罗榭答应这种要求？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But there was so much more bothering Chartrand. The cardinals. The cardinals were still locked in the Sistine Chapel. This was absolute insanity. The camerlegno had wanted them evacuated fifteen minutes ago! Rocher had overruled the decision and not informed the camerlegno. Chartrand had expressed concern, and Rocher had almost taken off his head. Chain of command was never questioned in the Swiss Guard, and Rocher was now top dog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但还有其他太多事让夏特朗担心。枢机团。那些枢机主教还被锁在西斯汀礼拜堂内，实在太荒唐了。总司库指示过，十五分钟前就该把他们撤出梵蒂冈的！罗榭没有知会总司库就推翻了这个决定。夏特朗曾表达他的忧虑，但罗榭差点把他的头给拧下来。在瑞士卫兵团这个军事指挥系统中，从来没有人敢质疑上级的命令，而罗榭现在是最高指挥官。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Half an hour, Rocher thought, discreetly checking his Swiss chronometer in the dim light of the candelabra lighting the hall. Please hurry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只剩半个小时了，罗榭心想，在走廊上分枝烛台照出的昏暗光线下，他谨慎地检查了手上的瑞士精密计时表。拜託快点吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chartrand wished he could hear what was happening on the other side of the doors. Still, he knew there was no one he would rather have handling this crisis than the camerlegno. The man had been tested beyond reason tonight, and he had not flinched. He had confronted the problem head-on… truthful, candid, shining like an example to all. Chartrand felt proud right now to be a Catholic. The Illuminati had made a mistake when they challenged Camerlegno Ventresca.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏特朗真希望听得见门裡发生了什麽事。然而，他相信总司库比谁都更有办法处理这个危机。总司库今天晚上经历了无情的考验，但他毫不畏缩。他抬头挺胸面对问题……诚实、坦白，表现得堪为众人之表率。此刻夏特朗以身为天主教徒为荣。光明会决定要向凡特雷思卡总司库挑战，真是大错特错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The banging was more desperate now. Chartrand ran thirty yards down the corridor to an intersection. The noise seemed to be coming from around the corner, beyond the Sala Clementina. Chartrand felt perplexed. There was only one room back there -- the Pope's private library. His Holiness's private library had been locked since the Pope's death. Nobody could possibly be in there!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在那个砰砰的声音敲得更急了。夏特朗沿著走廊往前跑三十码，来到一个交叉口。那个声音似乎是从角落传来的，就在克勉厅的另一头。夏特朗想不透。那边只有一个房间──教宗的私人图书室。自从教宗过世后，宗座的私人图书室就锁了起来。不可能有人在那裡的！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment, however, Chartrand's thoughts were jolted by an unexpected sound. A banging. It was coming from down the hall. The pounding was distant and muffled, but incessant. Rocher looked up. The captain turned to Chartrand and motioned down the hall. Chartrand understood. He turned on his flashlight and took off to investigate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当此时，夏特朗的思绪忽然被一个意想不到的声音打断了。那是砰砰的敲击声，从走廊远处传来。听起来好遥远，而且似乎被闷住了，可是持续不断。罗榭抬头望，然后转向夏特朗，往走廊那头比了一下。夏特朗明白他的意思，他打开手电筒过去察看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not make out the words, but he could hear the panic in their shouts. Was someone trapped in the library? Had the Swiss Guard not properly evacuated the building? Chartrand hesitated, wondering if he should go back and consult Rocher. The hell with that. Chartrand had been trained to make decisions, and he would make one now. He pulled out his side arm and fired a single shot into the door latch. The wood exploded, and the door swung open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听不出在喊什麽，但可以听到吼声中的恐慌。有人被困在图书室裡吗？是不是瑞士卫兵团疏散不当？夏特朗犹豫著，不知道是不是该回去问罗榭一声。管他去死。夏特朗所受的训练是要当机立断，现在他就做出了决定。他掏出佩枪，朝弹簧锁开了一枪。门上的木头一爆，门盪开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tentatively, Chartrand reached for the doorknob and turned. As he had imagined, the door was locked. He put his ear to the door. The banging was louder. Then he heard something else. Voices! Someone calling out!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏特朗伸手试了试门钮，转不动。不出他所料，门是锁住的。他把耳朵贴在门上，擂击声更大了。然后他听到了别的。人的声音！有人在大喊！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chartrand hurried down the second corridor, turned another corner, and rushed to the library door. The wooden portico was diminutive, but it stood in the dark like a dour sentinel. The banging was coming from somewhere inside. Chartrand hesitated. He had never been inside the private library. Few had. No one was allowed in without an escort by the Pope himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏特朗沿著第二道走廊往下，转到另一个角落，赶往图书室的门。那道木製门廊很小，但黑暗中看起来像个阴鬱的哨兵。砰砰声是从裡头某处传来的。夏特朗犹豫了。他从没进过这个私人图书室，很少人进去过。除非有教宗本人陪同，否则任何人都不准进去的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chartrand stared. The Pope's secret escape route! Chartrand had certainly heard ofIl Passetto, and he had even heard rumors that it had once had an entrance here in the library, but the tunnel had not been used in ages! Who could be banging on the other side?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏特朗瞪大眼睛。教宗的祕密逃脱路线！夏特朗当然听说过小廊道，甚至还听过传闻，说以前这个图书室裡有个入口。但这条隧道已经多年没有使用过了！怎麽可能有人在另一端敲门呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">IL PASSETTO</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小廊道">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The banging was clearer now. Chartrand shone his light across the room toward the sound. On the far wall, beyond the sitting area, was a huge door made of iron. It looked impenetrable as a vault. It had four mammoth locks. The tiny etched letters dead center of the door took Chartrand's breath away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在捶门声更清楚了。夏特朗把手电筒照向房间另一头，声音就是从那裡发出的。在远端的墙面上，小客厅再过去一点，是一扇很大的铁门，看起来像个保险库般难以穿透。门上有四个巨大的锁。门的正中央蚀刻著一排小字，让夏特朗屏住了气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beyond the threshold Chartrand saw nothing but blackness. He shone his flashlight. The room was rectangular -- oriental carpets, high oak shelves packed with books, a stitched leather couch, and a marble fireplace. Chartrand had heard stories of this place -- three thousand ancient volumes side by side with hundreds of current magazines and periodicals, anything His Holiness requested. The coffee table was covered with journals of science and politics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进了门，夏特朗只看到一片黑。他打开手电筒。这个房间是长方形的──东方地毯，高高的橡木书架塞满了书，一张皮革缝边的沙发，还有大理石壁炉。夏特朗听说过这个图书室的一些故事──三千本古书旁，排著几百本当期杂志与期刊，所有宗座要求订购的全都有。茶几上放著一堆科学和政治期刊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chartrand took his flashlight and rapped on the door. There was a muffled exultation from the other side. The banging stopped, and the voices yelled louder. Chartrand could barely make out their words through the barricade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏特朗用手电筒在门上叩击。门那头传来欣喜万分的模糊声响。砰砰的捶门声停止了，喊叫的声音更大。隔著那扇铁门，夏特朗简直听不出他们在喊什麽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite his training on the hazards of panic, Chartrand felt a sudden rush of fear at the last few words. Had he understood correctly? Heart pounding, he turned to run back to the office. As he turned, though, he stalled. His gaze had fallen to something on the door… something more shocking even than the message coming from beyond it. Emerging from the keyholes of each of the door's massive locks werekeys. Chartrand stared. Thekeys were here? He blinked in disbelief. The keys to this door were supposed to be in a vault someplace! This passage was never used -- not for centuries!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="儘管夏特朗受过训练，知道恐慌会遭致危险，但最后那几个字让他感觉到一股突如其来的恐惧。他没会错意吧？他心脏狂跳，他想转身衝回教宗办公室。但转到一半，他站住了。视线落在门上的某个东西……比门那头传来的讯息更令他震惊。门上的每个大锁裡，都插著一把钥匙。夏特朗目瞪口呆。钥匙原来就在这裡？他不敢置信地眨眨眼睛。这扇门的钥匙应该放在哪个保险库的！这条走道根本从来没人使用──几百年来都是如此！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chartrand looked at the iron barrier and knew he would need dynamite to get through there. "Impossible!" he yelled. "Too thick!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Chartrand dropped his flashlight on the floor. He grabbed the first key and turned. The mechanism was rusted and stiff, but it still worked. Someone had opened it recently. Chartrand worked the next lock. And the next. When the last bolt slid aside, Chartrand pulled. The slab of iron creaked open. He grabbed his light and shone it into the passage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏特朗把手电筒扔在地上，抓住第一个钥匙开始转。锁裡面的机械结构已经生锈发涩，但还是可以运作，有人最近开过。夏特朗又去开第二个，然后第三个。最后一个锁弹开后，夏特朗用力拉，那扇厚厚的铁门吱呀一声开了。他抓起手电筒，照进廊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
