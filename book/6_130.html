<div class="line_en">"I read Mr Gilmore's letter to my lawyer," he said, "and I want to give you a full explanation. Mrs Catherick, you see, worked for me and my family for many years. Her marriage was unfortunate, in that her husband deserted her, and her only child, a girl, became mentally ill and needed to be put in an asylum. So, in recognition of Mrs Catherick's services, I agreed to pay the expenses of a private asylum for the girl. Unfortunately, the girl discovered this and consequently developed a hatred for me. She recently escaped from the asylum and I'm sure she wrote this letter because of her hatred for me. It's all very sad."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a sad day when Walter Hartright left us. Laura stayed in her room all day, and I felt sad and depressed. Poor Mr Gilmore must have had a dull time, and the next morning, when Laura reappeared looking pale and ill, I thought he seemed rather anxious about her. I was anxious too. Laura is such a sensitive and loving person that it was no surprise to me to find that she had grown fond of Walter. Indeed, I have grown fond of him myself. But I honestly believe that time will cure Laura of these feelings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沃尔特·哈特里特先生离开的那天，我们都很难过。劳拉一整天呆在自己的房间里不出来，我的心情也很沉闷。可怜的吉尔摩先生肯定觉得那天很无聊。第二天早晨，劳拉从房间出来的时候，面容憔悴，像是病了一场。我觉得吉尔摩先生似乎很为她担心，我也为她担心。劳拉是个敏感而深情的人，她喜欢上沃尔特我一点儿也不觉得奇怪。其实，我自己也喜欢他。但是，我真心希望时间能够治愈劳拉的情伤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two days after Walter left, Sir Percival Glyde arrived. He is forty-five years old but seems younger. He is handsome, and only a little bald, has perfect manners, and is pleasant, agreeable, and respectful. I really must try to like him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沃尔特离开两天以后，珀西瓦尔·格莱德爵士来了。他45岁，但看上去比实际年龄要年轻一些。他很英俊，稍有些秃顶，举止优雅，温和有礼。我尽力让自己对这个人产生好感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening and the next day Sir Percival took every opportunity to bring Laura into the conversation, but she hardly took any notice. He went to the farm to make his enquiries about Anne Catherick, but learnt nothing. Then on Wednesday a letter came from Mrs Catherick -- a short, business-like letter, thanking me for my note and saying that everything Sir Percival had told me was completely correct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上以及第二天，珀西瓦尔爵士努力寻找一切机会同劳拉讲话，但劳拉一直心不在焉。珀西瓦尔去农场调查，结果一无所获。星期三凯瑟里克太太来信了，那是一封简短而又正式的信。信中感谢我给她写信，并且说珀西瓦尔爵士告诉我的都是事实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why did I still have doubts? This, surely, was enough proof for anyone, but how I wished that Walter Hartright had been there to give his opinion! At Sir Percival's request I now had to give Laura his explanation of Anne Catherick's letter. She listened quietly and showed no emotion, but I noticed that on the table near her hand was the little book of Hartright's drawings. I also had to tell her that the reason for Sir Percival's visit was to fix the day of their marriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么我还是有疑问呢？这封信对谁来讲都是充分的证据，可我还是很希望沃尔特·哈特里特先生能在这儿发表一下他的看法。应珀西瓦尔爵士的要求，我得向劳拉解释一下安妮·凯瑟里克来信的事情。她静静地听着，脸上毫无表情。我注意到她手边的桌上放着哈特里特先生的画册。我还得告诉她，珀西瓦尔爵士此行的目的是要确定他们结婚的日期。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing that happened the next morning did nothing to make me feel more cheerful. A letter arrived for me from poor Walter Hartright. He had decided to leave England and asked me if I could help him find employment abroad. I was then alarmed to read that since his return to London he had neither seen nor heard anything of Anne Catherick, but suspected he had been watched and followed by strange men. I was worried about his state of mind, so I immediately wrote to some friends in London to ask if they could help him find a suitable job in another country. Laura, of course, knew nothing about these letters.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Secondly, when Miss Fairlie reaches the age of twenty-one next March, she will receive the income from ￡10,000. This ￡10,000 will go to her aunt Eleanor, if Miss Fairlie dies before her aunt -- which is not very likely. The reason Miss Fairlie's father did not leave the ￡10,000 to his sister Eleanor on his death was that he disapproved strongly of her marriage to a foreigner, even though the man was an Italian nobleman, Count Fosco."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二，明年3月费尔利小姐21岁的时候，她将得到10,000英镑的收入。如果费尔利小姐在她姑妈埃莉诺之前死去，这笔钱就归她姑妈，这当然不大可能。费尔利小姐的父亲之所以死的时候没有把这10,000英镑留给他的妹妹埃莉诺，是因为他强烈反对她嫁给一个外国人，虽然那个人是位意大利贵族，福斯科伯爵。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As you will know," he went on, "there are three parts to Miss Fairlie's inheritance. Firstly, on Mr Fairlie's death, she will inherit the Limmeridge property and land, and the income from it. If she dies childless, this property will go to a cousin, but the income from it will go to her husband during his lifetime. If she has a son, everything -- property and income -- will go to the son. No problems there.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," Mr Gilmore went on, "there are no problems there either. But the third part of Miss Fairlie's inheritance is more difficult. Next March she will also inherit ￡20,000, which will be her own money completely. If she dies before her husband, the income from the ￡20,000 will go to Sir Percival for his lifetime, and the capital will go to their children. If there are no children to inherit the capital, Miss Fairlie can choose relations and friends to inherit the money when she dies. That's what I proposed, but Sir Percival's lawyer did not accept it. He insists that if Sir Percival survives his wife and there are no children, Sir Percival should receive the capital. In that case, nothing will go to any other member of the family, including you, Miss Halcombe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”吉尔摩先生接着说，“这一部分也没有问题。可是第三部分就不那么简单了。明年3月，她还将继承20,000英镑，这完全是属于她个人的一笔钱。如果她先于她丈夫死去，从这20,000英镑获得的收入将属于珀西瓦尔爵士，直至他去世；而这20,000英镑本金将归他们的孩子所有。假如没有孩子继承这笔钱，费尔利小姐死的时候，可以选择亲属或朋友继承。这是我的建议。但是，珀西瓦尔爵士的律师拒不接受这一点，他坚持认为，如果珀西瓦尔爵士死在他妻子后面，同时他们又没有孩子，珀西瓦尔就应该得到这笔钱。那样的话，费尔利家族的任何其他人，包括你在内，都得不到一分钱，哈尔库姆小姐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I've discovered, you see, that Sir Percival is always in debt and always in need of cash. My last effort has been to come here, to try and persuade Mr Fairlie to oppose this demand from Sir Percival's lawyer. I am sorry to say I have not succeeded. Mr Fairlie wishes to avoid all responsibility for his niece's marriage arrangements. He says that his niece will not die before Sir Percival anyway, so what is there to worry about?"</div>

<div class="line_en">All too quickly the days passed. Sir Percival arrived, looking a little tired and anxious but talking and laughing like the happiest of men. The evening after he arrived he went off to the village to ask if anyone had any news of Anne Catherick. No one had heard anything, but I had to admit that it was good of him to continue to try to help her. I have decided to try and think better of him. After all, what reason do I have to distrust him?

We heard every day from Sir Percival. After the wedding he proposed to take Laura to Italy for six months. They would meet a number of Sir Percival's friends there, including his best and oldest friend, Count Fosco, whose wife, of course, was Laura's Aunt Eleanor. At least this marriage would bring Laura and her aunt together again, I thought. The Count himself sounded a most interesting person, and I rather hoped that I would meet him one day.</div>
