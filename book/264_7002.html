<div class="line_en">Little John and Robin set off together to Kirkley Abbey as fast as they could go. It was a difficult and painful journey. It was only a few days before Christmas. The snow lay thick on the ground, the roads were almost blocked and it was terribly cold. They went bravely on, but on the journey Robin became very ill indeed -- -- so ill that he could not sit on his horse. Along the last part of the road, Little John carried him in his arms through the deep snow.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as she was alone with him the Prioress made a cut in Robin's arm so that the blood flowed out. She pretended to tie the wound up again, but she put the bandage on so badly that the blood flowed all the same. Then she locked Robin in the room and went away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女院长一单独跟罗宾在一起，就在他的胳膊上割了一道口子，让血流出来。她假装把伤口再包扎起来，但是把绷带勉强一缠，血还一直在流。然后，他把罗宾锁在屋里，自己走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As long as Robin was well and strong she could do nothing that would hurt him. But now that he had come to her, weak and ill, he was in her power. She meant not to cure him, but to kill him. That was why she sent Little John away. She was a very wicked woman indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要罗宾健壮，她就没办法伤害他。但现在既然他来到她这里，体弱多病，他就到了她的掌心。她不打算给他治疗，而是要杀害他。那就是他把小约翰打发走的原因。她的确是一个坏女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
