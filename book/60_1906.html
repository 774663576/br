<div class="line_en">They all looked at her in amazement. She basked in it. Franz reacted with a mixture of disgust (he knew that after the accident in question his wife had fallen into a deep depression and complained incessantly) and admiration (her ability to transform everything she experienced was a sign of true vitality).</div>

<div class="line_en">What do you mean? said Marie-Claude in a raucous voice. She was in top form. I was in a serious accident once, and I wouldn't have missed it for the world. And I've never had more fun than when I was in that hospital! I couldn't sleep a wink, so I just read and read, day and night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“完全不是这样！”玛丽—克洛德气色极佳，亮着嗓门说，“我就碰上过一次车祸，那才叫妙呢！我从来没感觉到有比在医院待得更好的地方！我根本就不合眼，没日没夜地看书，一个劲儿地看。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd never drive. I'm scared stiff of accidents! Even if they don't kill you, they mark you for life! And so saying, the sculptor made an instinctive grab for the finger he had nearly chopped off one day while whittling away at a wood statue. It was a miracle the finger had been saved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“永远别想叫我上汽车！我真的好怕出车祸！就算不死，余生也会一直受折磨！”雕塑家边说边不由自主地捂着自己的一个食指，一次凿木头，这指头差点被削断，多亏医生，奇迹般地把它保住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was there I began to divide books into day books and night books, she went on. Really, there are books meant for daytime reading and books that can be read only at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她接着又说：“就是在医院，我开始把书分成两类：白天的和黑夜的。确实如此，有的书是白天读的，而有的书只能晚上读。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Marie-Claude turned to him and asked, Which category would you put Stendhal in?</div>

<div class="line_en">The sculptor had not heard the question and shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably. An art critic standing next to him said he thought of Stendhal as daytime reading.</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz's participation in the debate on night art and day art was disturbed by the fact that he was expecting Sabina to show up at any minute. They had spent many days pondering whether or not she should accept the invitation to this cocktail party. It was a party Marie-Claude was giving for all painters and sculptors who had ever exhibited in her private gallery. Ever since Sabina had met Franz, she had avoided his wife. But because they feared being found out, they came to the conclusion that it would be more natural and therefore less suspicious for her to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨远远地听着这场关于白天黑夜的艺术之争，心里直惦念着萨比娜何时到来。他俩考虑了好几天，她到底应不应该接受邀请，参加玛丽—克洛德为在她的私人画廊展出过作品的画家和雕塑家举办的这个鸡尾酒会。自从萨比娜认识了弗兰茨，她就一直回避他的妻子。但虽说她害怕露出破绽，最终还是决定来参加，这样更自然些，免得让人多猜疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While throwing unobtrusive looks in the direction of the entrance hall, Franz heard his eighteen-year-old daughter, Marie-Anne, holding forth at the other end of the room. Excusing himself from the group presided over by his wife, he made his way to the group presided over by his daughter. Some were in chairs, others standing, but Marie-Anne was cross-legged on the floor. Franz was certain that Marie-Claude would soon switch to the carpet on her side of the room, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他时不时地朝门口偷瞟几眼，突然，他见客厅的另一头，传来了他十八岁的女儿玛丽—安娜高谈阔论，滔滔不绝的声音。他遂离开妻子招呼的这群客人，向女儿统领的圈子走去。只见有一人坐在扶手椅上，其余人都站着，玛丽—安娜则坐在地上。弗兰茨心里清楚，客厅另一头的玛丽—克洛德不一会儿也肯定会坐到地毯上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sitting on the floor when you had guests was at the time a gesture signifying simplicity, informality, liberal politics, hospitality, and a Parisian way of life. The passion with which Marie-Claude sat on all floors was such that Franz began to worry she would take to sitting on the floor of the shop where she bought her cigarettes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个年代，在客人面前席地而坐，这一举动表示的是随意、放松，思想进步、好相处，还有一股巴黎味。玛丽—克洛德动不动就往地上一坐，弗兰茨真担心哪天会看到她在常去买烟的小店的地上坐着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What are you working on now, Alain? Marie-Anne asked the man at whose feet she was sitting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您目前在做什么，阿兰？”玛丽—安娜问一个男人，她就坐在这个男人的脚下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alain was so naive and sincere as to try to give the gallery owner's daughter an honest answer. He started explaining his new approach to her, a combination of photography and oil, but he had scarcely got through three sentences when Marie-Anne began whistling a tune. The painter was speaking slowly and with great concentration and did not hear the whistling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿兰是个老实人，又天真，他想认认真真地回画廊主女儿的话。他先向她解释说，自己用了一种新的技法，将摄影与油画糅合在一起。可他没说三句话，玛丽—安娜便发出嘘声。画家很用心，慢吞吞地说着，没有听到她的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Will you tell me why you're whistling? Franz whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨低声问：“你能告诉我为什么你要这样嘘嘘叫？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And in fact, two men standing in the same circle were discussing the coming elections in France. Marie-Anne, who felt it her duty to direct the proceedings, asked the men whether they were planning to go to the Rossini opera an Italian company was putting on in Geneva the following week. Meanwhile, Alain the painter sank into greater and greater detail about his new approach to painting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确，在这群人当中，有两个站着的男子正在谈论即将开始的法国大选。玛丽—安娜觉得应该由自己出面主导谈话，便张口问那两位男子下周去不去大剧院，有个意大利剧团要在那儿表演一出罗西尼的歌剧。画家阿兰还是不放弃，执著地在寻找更为准确的词语，来解释他的新画技。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because I don't like to hear people talk about politics, she answered out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为我讨厌有人谈论政治。”他女儿大声答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You're awful, said Marie-Anne, trying to punch him in the stomach from a sitting position. The star tenor is so handsome. So handsome. I've seen him twice now, and I'm in love with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你什么都不懂，”玛丽—安娜没有抬一下屁股，坐着撞了一下父亲的肚子，说，“那个男主角太帅啦！帅疯了！我见过他两次，都迷疯了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz was ashamed for his daughter. To put her in her place, he announced that whenever she went to the opera she complained terribly of boredom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨为女儿感到羞愧。为了让她闭嘴，他说要是去听歌剧非得闷死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz could not get over how much like her mother his daughter was. Why couldn't she be like him? But there was nothing he could do about it. She was not like him. How many times had he heard Marie-Claude proclaim she was in love with this or that painter, singer, writer, politician, and once even with a racing cyclist? Of course, it was all mere cocktail party rhetoric, but he could not help recalling now and then that more than twenty years ago she had gone about saying the same thing about-him and threatening him with suicide to boot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨发觉女儿和妻子像得可怕。为什么女儿就不像他呢？毫无指望，女儿跟他一点不像。他已经听玛丽—克洛德说过上千次，说她迷恋上了这个或那个画家，要不就是哪个歌星、作家、政客，甚至还迷上了一个自行车赛手。这显然不过是晚宴或鸡尾酒会上的信口胡言，但他有时候会想起，二十多年前她曾以自杀相威胁，当时对他所说的话，竟然完全相同。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I made it myself, said Sabina.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是我自己做的。”萨比娜答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those words made a deep impression on Franz. They were not meant to be combative; the raucous laughter immediately following them made it clear that by rejecting the pendant Marie-Claude did not wish to jeopardize her friendship with Sabina. But it was not the kind of thing she usually said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨被这句话镇住了。这话说出来并没带有冒犯的口气，相反，玛丽—克洛德响亮的笑声即刻表明，对吊坠的反感并不影响她对女画家的情谊。不过，玛丽—克洛德说这话的语气，与平常同其他人说话时的还是有所不同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that point, Sabina entered the room. Marie-Claude walked up to her. While Marie-Anne went on about Rossini, Franz trained his attention on what the two women were saying. After a few friendly words of greeting, Marie-Claude lifted the ceramic pendant from Sabina's neck and said in a very loud voice, What is that? How ugly!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在此时，萨比娜走进门来。玛丽—克洛德看到她，迎上前去。女儿继续谈论着罗西尼，而弗兰茨只有心听那两个女人的对话。几句欢迎的客套话之后，玛丽—克洛德用手指捏起萨比娜颈间的陶瓷吊坠，大声说：“这是什么玩艺儿？真难看！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That pendant is ugly, really! Marie-Claude repeated very loudly. You shouldn't wear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得它很难看，真的。”玛丽—克洛德又高声说了一遍，“你不该戴的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz knew his wife didn't care whether the pendant was ugly or not. An object was ugly if she willed it ugly, beautiful if she willed it beautiful. Pendants worn by her friends were a priori beautiful. And even if she did find them ugly, she would never say so, because flattery had long since become second nature to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨知道，一件首饰丑或美，他妻子根本就不感兴趣。她要是想觉得丑，那就是丑，想觉得美，那就是美，凡她的女朋友戴的珠宝，那怎么也是美的。她也许会觉得那珠宝很丑，但会小心藏在心里不说，多少年来，她就惯于奉承，因此已成了她的第二天性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sabina's exhibition the year before had not been particularly successful, so Marie-Claude did not set great store by Sabina's favor. Sabina, however, had every reason to set store by Marie-Claude's. Yet that was not at all evident from her behavior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去年，萨比娜的画展并未大获成功，玛丽—克洛德也就一点也不担心失去萨比娜的好感。反之，萨比娜有种种理由要博取玛丽—克洛德的欢心，可她的言行里丝毫没有流露出这种意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
