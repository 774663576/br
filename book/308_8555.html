<div class="line_en">"Charles Kent's. The barmaid at the Dog and Whistle, Sally Jones, she remembers him perfectly. Picked out his photograph from among five others. It was just a quarter to ten when he came into the bar, and the Dog and Whistle is well over a mile from Fernly Park. The girl mentions that he had a lot of money on him -- she saw him take a handful of notes out of his pocket. Rather surprised her, it did, seeing the class of fellow he was, with a pair of boots clean dropping off him. That's where that forty pounds went right enough."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Seems quite O. K., doesn't it?" said the inspector rather gloomily. "A chap can't be murdering someone in one place when he's drinking in the bar in another place a mile away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“似乎没有漏洞，是吧？”警督闷闷不乐，“他不可能一边杀人，同时又在一英里外的酒吧喝酒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Might as well, I suppose. After all, even if he is a bit balmy, it was a useful dp he gave me about those fingerprints. He's got a bee in his bonnet about the man Kent, but who knows -- there may be something useful behind it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也好。虽然他有点傻，但起码在指纹的问题上还是给了我很有用的提示。不过他未免太在意肯特了，可谁知道呢——也许背后还有隐情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Poirot received us with his usual smiling courtesy. He listened to the information we had brought him, nodding his head now and then.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波洛和往常一样，笑容满面地迎接我们。他认真听着我们带来的消息，不时点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you going to release him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们打算放了他？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jump in. Inspector," I said, opening the door of the car. "We'll go up to The Larches together, and acquaint our Belgian friend with the latest news."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't see what else we can do. We can't very well hold him for obtaining money on false pretences. Can't prove a ruddy thing." The inspector tossed a match into the grate in a disgruntled fashion. Poirot retrieved it and put it neatly in a little receptacle designed for the purpose. His action was purely mechanical. I could see that his thoughts were on something very different.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没办法，总不能因为他的钱来路不明就一直拘留下去。没法证明他是凶手。”警督边嘟囔着发牢骚，边将一根火柴投进壁炉。波洛又把它捡出来，扔进一个专门收纳火柴的盒子里。从那机械般的动作，看得出来他另有所思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可那楼梯只通往艾克罗伊德先生的卧室。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I suggest nothing," said Poirot. "But I will remind you of this. Life was not very easy for that mother and daughter. There were bills -- there was constant trouble over small sums of money. Roger Ackroyd was a peculiar man over money matters. The girl might be at her wits' end for a comparatively small sum. Figure to yourself then what happens. She has taken the money, she descends the little staircase. When she is half-way down she hears the chink of glass from the hall. She has not a doubt of what it is -- Parker coming to the study. At all costs she must not be found on the stairs -- Parker will not forget it, he will think it odd. If the money is missed, Parker is sure to remember having seen her come down those stairs. She has just time to rush down to the study door -- with her hand on the handle to show that she has just come out, when Parker appears in the doorway. She says the first thing that comes into her head, a repetition of Roger Ackroyd's orders earlier in the evening, and then goes upstairs to her own room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可什么都没说，”波洛说，“不过我得提醒你，她们母女的日子过得很拮据。账单一大堆，东一笔西一笔，总会让她们捉襟见肘。罗杰·艾克罗伊德管钱管得很严，一点小债就足以使那姑娘走投无路了。不妨设想一下当时的情景：她偷了钱，走下那段小楼梯，半路听见客厅里传来杯盘之声，立刻明白是怎么回事——帕克要去书房。无论如何不能让他发现自己在楼梯上——帕克可不健忘，他会起疑心的。如果到时候发现钱少了，帕克肯定会想起她从楼梯下来的事。时间刚够让她冲到书房门口——把手搭上门把，装出刚从书房出来的模样，接着帕克就过来了。她灵机一动，顺口编出一句台词，把当晚早些时候罗杰·艾克罗伊德的吩咐重复一遍，光明正大地回自己房里去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The stairs?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“楼梯上？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No." Poirot's voice rang out with sudden sharpness. "That is just what he did not see. I satisfied myself of that by a little experiment the other day -- you remember, doctor? Parker saw her outside the door, with her hand on the handle. He did not see her come out of the room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”波洛突然高声反驳，“他明明没看见。我那天用一个小小的实验证明了这一点——还记得吗，医生？帕克只看见她站在门外，手放在门把上，并没亲眼见她走出书房。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But -- where else could she have been?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是——那她原来在哪儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Afterwards," said Poirot drily, "it was a little difficult for Mademoiselle Flora. She is told simply that the police are here and that there has been a robbery. Naturally she jumps to the conclusion that the theft of the money has been discovered. Her one idea is to stick to her story. When she learns that her uncle is dead she is panic-stricken. Young women do not faint nowadays, monsieur, without considerable provocation. Eh bien! there it is. She is bound to stick to her story, or else confess everything. And a young and pretty girl does not like to admit that she is a thief -- especially before those whose esteem she is anxious to retain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“事后弗洛拉哪里说得出口。”波洛不为所动，“一开始她只听说家里被盗，来了警察。她自然就立刻得出结论，丢钱的事曝光了。她只能一口咬定自己那套说辞。当她得知伯父遇害时，彻底被吓坏了。先生，这年头的年轻姑娘如果没受到特别大的刺激，是不会轻易晕倒的。好，事已至此，她只有两条路可走：要么咬牙坚持原来的证词，要么就供认一切。而一位年轻貌美的姑娘不可能愿意承认自己是个小偷——尤其是在那些她急于赢得尊重的人面前。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The possibility has been in my mind from the first," admitted Poirot. "I was always convinced that Mademoiselle Flora was hiding something from us. To satisfy myself, I made the little experiment I told you of. Dr Sheppard accompanied me."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Flora drew herself up and spoke. "M. Poirot is right. I took that money. I stole. I am a thiefyes, a common, vulgar little thief. Now you know! I am glad it has come out. It's been a nightmare, these last few days!" She sat down suddenly and buried her face in her hands. She spoke huskily through her fingers. "You don't know what my life has been since I came here. Wanting things, scheming for them, lying, cheating, running up bills, promising to pay oh! I hate myself when I think of it all! That's what brought us together, Ralph and I. We were both weak! I understood him, and I was sorry -- because I'm the same underneath. We're not strong enough to stand alone, either of us. We're weak, miserable, despicable things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着弗洛拉挺直身子，答道：“波洛先生说得对，钱是我拿的。我偷了钱，我是个贼——不错，一个普通的、自甘下贱的小偷。现在你们都明白了吧！真相大白，我反倒更开心，过去这几天就像做噩梦！”她突然跌坐下去，双手捂住脸，沙哑的嗓音从指缝间传出，“你们根本不理解，来到这个家之后我过的是什么日子。想买东西，就不得不处心积虑、撒谎、欺骗；欠了一屁股债，对债主低三下四——哦！一想起这些，我就憎恨不已！所以拉尔夫和我才会走到一起，我们都那么脆弱！我理解他，也同情他——他同样寄人篱下。我们都无法自力更生，都是那么脆弱、可悲、可鄙的小人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I hate myself, despise myselfbut you've got to believe one thing, if speaking the truth would have made things better for Ralph, I would have spoken out.

<div class="line_en">"You think that she loves the Capitaine Ralph Paton -- but I, Hercule Poirot, tell you that that is not so. Mademoiselle Flora accepted Captain Paton to please her uncle, and because she saw in the marriage a way of escape from her life here which was becoming frankly insupportable to her.

Oh! let us not mind saying these things -- why must one in England think it necessary to mention love as though it were some disgraceful secret? You love Mademoiselle Flora.
