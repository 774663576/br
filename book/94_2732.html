<div class="line_en">It's a normal building, by and large. It has four floors and nine flats and the whole block smells of Granny (and coffee, thanks to Lennart). It also has a clear set of regulations pinned up in the laundry, with the heading FOR EVERYONE'S WELL-BEING in which WELL-BEING has been underlined twice. And a lift that's always broken and rubbish separated for recycling in the yard, and a drunk, a very large animal of some sort, and, of course, a granny.</div>

<div class="line_en">There's something special about a grandmother's house. You never forget how it smells.</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny lives at the top, opposite Mum and Elsa and George. Granny's flat is exactly like Mum's except much messier, because Granny's flat is like Granny and Mum's flat is like Mum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆住在顶楼，和妈妈、爱莎、乔治对门。外婆的公寓和妈妈的完全一样，除了乱得多，因为外婆的公寓就像外婆这个人，而妈妈的公寓就像妈妈这个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">George lives with Mum and that's not always the easiest of things, because it means he also lives next door to Granny. He has a beard and a very small hat and is obsessed with jogging, during which he insists on wearing his shorts over the top of his tracksuit. He cooks in English, and so when he's reading the recipes he says "pork" instead of "flask." Granny never calls him "George," just "Loser," which infuriates Mum, but Elsa knows why Granny's doing it. She just wants Elsa to know she's on Elsa's side, no matter what. Because that's what you do when you're a granny and your grandchild's parents get divorced and find themselves new partners and suddenly tell your grandchild there's a half sibling on its way. That it irritates the hell out of Mum is something Granny views purely as a bonus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治和妈妈住在一起，这通常不是件容易的事，因为这意味着他也住在外婆隔壁。他蓄着胡子，常戴一顶小帽子，痴迷于慢跑，跑步时总坚持将运动服束在短裤里头。他烹饪时用外语念菜谱。外婆从不叫他“乔治”，只叫他“废物”，这让妈妈非常愤怒，但爱莎知道外婆为什么这么叫。她只是想让爱莎知道，她是站在爱莎这边的，不管发生什么。因为当外孙女的父母离异且找到新伴侣，还告诉外孙女她将有一个同母异父的弟弟或者妹妹时，一位外婆就应该这么干。惹怒妈妈在外婆看来单纯只是附加的奖励。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Obviously Elsa knows that Granny doesn't dislike Halfie. Or even George, really. She just talks that way because she's Granny. One time Elsa told Granny she really did hate George, and that sometimes she even hated Halfie too. It's very difficult not to love someone who can hear you say something as horrible as that and still be on your side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎当然知道外婆其实不是不喜欢“小半”，包括乔治。她这么表现只是因为她是外婆。有一次，爱莎告诉外婆，她真的恨乔治，有时候甚至恨“小半”。当你说出这么可怕的话时，听到的那个人居然还能站在你这边，你无法不去爱这样的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Elvir, though? Are they planning to send him to Mordor to destroy the ring, or what?" (This was soon after Granny had watched all of the Lord of the Rings films with Elsa, because Elsa's mum had expressly told Elsa she wasn't allowed to watch them.)</div>

It ended up being a very confusing afternoon for all involved.</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie is almost always at home, so Elsa assumes she is not an entrepreneur. Granny calls her "a full-time nag-bag who will forever be the bane of my life." She always looks a little like she just popped the wrong chocolate into her mouth. She's the one who put up the sign in the laundry with that FOR EVERYONE'S WELL-BEING bit on it. Everyone's well-being is very important to Britt-Marie, even though she and Kent are the only people in the house with a washing machine and tumble-dryer in their flat. One time after George had done some laundry, Britt-Marie came upstairs and asked to have a word with Elsa's mum. She'd brought a little ball of blue fluff from the tumble-dryer filter, which she held out towards Mum as if it were a newly hatched chick, and said: "I think you forgot this when you were doing the laundry, Ulrika!" And then when George explained that actually he was in charge of their laundry, Britt-Marie looked at him and smiled, though she didn't seem very genuine about it. And then she said, "How very modern," and smiled well-meaningly at Mum and handed her the fluff and said: "For everyone's well-being, in this leaseholders' association we clear the dryer filter when we've finished, Ulrika!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽几乎总是在家，所以爱莎推测她不是位企业家。外婆称呼她为“永远是我的灾星兼全职烦人精”。她看上去总是一副吃错巧克力的模样。就是她在洗衣房里贴上了那个写着“为了每个人的福祉”的规章。每个人的福祉对布里特—玛丽来说十分重要，虽然她和肯特是整幢楼唯一在自己公寓里就有洗衣机和滚筒烘干机的人。某次乔治洗好衣服之后，布里特—玛丽上楼要求和爱莎的妈妈谈谈。她带着从滚筒烘干机的过滤器中取出的一小团蓝色毛球，举到妈妈面前，就好像那是一只新孵出来的小鸡，说：“我想，你洗衣服的时候忘记这个了，乌尔莉卡！”当乔治解释说，其实是他负责洗衣服时，布里特—玛丽看着他笑了，虽然这笑容看上去不怎么真诚。她说：“男人干家务，真新潮啊。”然后意味深长地朝着妈妈笑着递出了毛球。“在这个租户协会里，为了每个人的福祉，我们洗完衣服就该清干净毛球，乌尔莉卡！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Under Britt-Marie and Kent's flat live Lennart and Maud. Lennart drinks at least twenty cups of coffee per day and always looks triumphantly proud every time his percolator is turned on. He is the second-nicest person in the world, and he's married to Maud. Maud is the nicest person in the world and she has always just baked some cookies. They live with Samantha, who's almost always asleep. Samantha is a bichon frise but Lennart and Maud talk to her as if she wasn't. When Lennart and Maud drink coffee in front of Samantha they don't say they're having "coffee," they call it "a drink for grown-ups." Granny says they're soft in the head, but Elsa just thinks they're nice. And they always have dreams and hugs -- dreams are a kind of cookie; hugs are just normal hugs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽和肯特楼下的公寓住着莱纳特和莫德。莱纳特每天至少要喝二十杯咖啡，每当他的咖啡壶开始运作时，他都看上去格外得意。他是这个世界上第二好的人，而且还娶了莫德。莫德是这个世界上最好的人，总是在烤饼干。他们和萨曼莎住在一起。萨曼莎是一条比熊犬，但莱纳特和莫德对它说话时从不当它是条狗。莱纳特和莫德在萨曼莎面前喝咖啡，也从不说自己在喝“咖啡”，而是说“大人的饮料”。外婆总说他们傻里傻气的，但爱莎认为他们是好人。而且他们总是有满满的梦想和拥抱——“梦想”是一种饼干，拥抱就是普通的拥抱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the flat opposite Britt-Marie and Kent lives the woman with the black skirt. You hardly ever see her except when she scurries between the front entrance and her door early in the morning and late at night. She always wears high heels and a perfectly ironed black skirt and talks extremely loudly into a white cord trailing from her ear. She never says hello and she never smiles. Granny says that her skirt is too well-ironed and "if you were the cloth hanging off that woman you'd be terrified of getting yourself creased."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽和肯特对面的公寓里住着穿黑裙的女人。人们很少见到她，除了一大清早或深更半夜她在大楼入口和她的家门之间匆匆经过时。她总是脚踏高跟鞋，身着熨烫平整的黑色短裙，冲着白色耳机线大声说话。她从不跟人打招呼也从不微笑。外婆总说，她的裙子熨得过分平整了。“如果你是那女人身上的衣服，你会紧张兮兮生怕被弄皱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Elsa knows what "antagonist" means, because you do if you read quality literature.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the flat under Lennart and Maud live the boy with a syndrome and his mum. The boy with a syndrome is a year and a few weeks younger than Elsa, and never speaks. His mother loses things all the time. Objects seem to rain from her pockets, like in a cartoon when the crook gets frisked by the police and the pile of stuff from his pockets ends up bigger than they are. Both the boy and his mother have very kind eyes, and not even Granny seems to dislike them. And the boy's always dancing. He dances his way through his existence.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the flat next to theirs, on the other side of the lift that never works, lives The Monster. Elsa doesn't know what his real name is, but she calls him The Monster because everyone is afraid of him. Even Elsa's mum, who isn't scared of anything in the entire world, gives Elsa's back a little shove when they're about to walk past his flat. No one ever sees The Monster because he never goes out in the daytime, but Kent always says "People like that shouldn't be let loose! But that's what happens when the authorities go for the soft option. People in this bloody country get psychiatric care instead of prison!" Britt-Marie has written letters to the landlord, demanding that The Monster be evicted in view of her firm conviction that he "attracts other substance abusers into the building." Elsa is not sure what that means, and she's not even sure Britt-Marie knows. She asked Granny one day, but she just went a bit quiet and said, "Certain things should be left well alone." And this is a granny who fought in the War-Without-End, the war against the shadows in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, and who has met the most terrifying creatures that have been dreamed up in an eternity of ten thousand fairy tales.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在母子俩的隔壁，那台从不运转的电梯的另一侧，住着怪物。爱莎不知道他的真名，她叫他怪物，因为每个人都害怕他。即使是天不怕地不怕的爱莎妈妈，在经过他的公寓时，也会轻轻推一下爱莎的后背，让她走快点儿。没有人见过怪物，因为他从不在白天出门，但肯特总是说：“对那种人不能放任不管！政府图省事才会让这种事情发生，用精神病护理代替监狱！”布里特—玛丽曾多次给房东写信，要求将怪物驱逐出去，因为她可以肯定他“会吸引其他瘾君子来这栋房子”。爱莎不太明白那是什么含义，她甚至不确定布里特—玛丽是否明白。有一天她问外婆，而外婆迟疑了一下，说：“有些东西就不该去打扰。”这可是外婆啊，参加过不眠大陆抗击暗影的无尽战争的外婆，见识过耗费“一万个童话永恒”幻想出来的最可怕生物的外婆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Opposite Lennart and Maud lives Alf. He drives a taxi and always wears a leather jacket under a layer of irascibility. His shoes have soles as thin as greaseproof paper because he doesn't lift his feet when he walks. Granny says he has the lowest center of gravity in the entire bloody universe.</div>

<div class="line_en">That's how you measure time in the Land-of-Almost-Awake: in eternities. There are no watches in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, so time is measured according to how you feel. If it feels like an eternity, you say, "This is a lesser eternity." And if it feels sort of like two dozen eternities, you say, "An utter eternity." And the only thing that feels longer than an utter eternity is the eternity of a fairy tale, because a fairy tale is an eternity of utter eternities. And the very longest kind of eternity in existence is the eternity of ten thousand fairy tales. That's the biggest number in the Land-of-Almost-Awake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“永恒”是不眠大陆的计时单位。不眠大陆没有手表，所以如何测量时间全凭你的感觉。如果感觉像是一个永恒，你就说这是“一个小永恒”。如果感觉有差不多两打永恒，你就说“一个完全永恒”。而唯一比“一个完全永恒”感觉更长的就是“一个童话永恒”，因为一个童话是无数个永恒的合集。而现有的最长“永恒”，是“一万个童话永恒”。这是不眠大陆最久的时间了。不过，“永恒”偶尔也会被外婆乱用来表示巨大的数字。外婆嘛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, to get back to the point: at the bottom of the house where all these people live, there's a meeting room, where residents' meetings are held once every month. This is a bit more than in most buildings, but the flats are rented, and Britt-Marie and Kent really want everyone living there, by "a democratic process," to make a request to the landlord to sell them the building so they can become flat owners. And to do that, you must have residents' meetings. Because no one else in the house actually wants to be a flat-owner. The democratic bit of the democratic process is the one Kent and Britt-Marie like the least, you might say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="言归正传，在所有这些人住的公寓的底层，是一间公共休息室，每月一次的居民会议就在这里举行。这比大多数公寓楼都要频繁，因为这里的公寓全是租的，而布里特—玛丽和肯特非常希望每个住在这里的人“通过民主流程”要求房东把房子卖给他们，使他们成为房主。为此，他们必须召开居民会议。而公寓里的其他人其实都不想成为房主，因此可以说，布里特—玛丽和肯特最不喜欢的便是民主流程中的“民主”部分。">查看中文翻译</div>

We will dizcuzz it at ze meeting in Frankfurt!" into his telephone. Alf looks up from his evening newspaper and taps his wristwatch and mutters, "Hope we didn't cause you any inconvenience by being here on time." Kent ignores him and instead claps his hands excitedly towards Lennart and Maud and says, with a grin, "Shall we kick things off, then? Eh? It's not like we're getting any babies made here, are we?" And then he turns quickly to Mum and points at her belly and laughs: "At least no more than we've already got!"

<div class="line_en">Then she looks at the door of the flat next to The Monster's, the one without a name on the mail slot. That is where Our Friend lives. Elsa stands a few feet from it, holding her breath because she's afraid it will smash the door and come charging out of the splintered remains and try to close its jaws around her throat if it hears her coming too close. Only Granny calls it Our Friend; everyone else says "the hound." Especially Britt-Marie. Elsa doesn't know how much fight there is in it, but either way she's never seen such a big dog in her life. When you hear it barking from behind the door it's like being whacked in the stomach by a medicine ball.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她看向怪物隔壁的房门，那扇门上的投信口没有写名字。“我们的朋友”就住在那里。爱莎站在几步开外，屏住呼吸，害怕它如果听见自己靠得太近，就会撞破房门，从木门碎片中冲出来，张开大嘴咬断她的喉咙。只有外婆称它为“我们的朋友”，别人都叫它“猎犬”，尤其是布里特—玛丽。爱莎不知道它到底有多凶猛，在她的人生中从没见过那么大的狗。听它在门里的吼叫声，感觉就像实心球击打在肚子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then Kent declares the meeting open and then everyone argues for two hours about what they argued about at the last meeting. Which is when Elsa sneaks out without anyone noticing. She tiptoes up the stairs to the mezzanine floor. She peers at the door to The Monster's flat, but calms herself with the thought that there is still daylight outside. The Monster never goes outside while it's still light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，肯特宣布会议开始，每个人就上一次会议时他们争吵的事情再次吵上两小时。于是，爱莎就可以在无人注意的情况下偷溜出去。她踮着脚尖走上楼梯到二楼，盯着怪物的公寓房门，对自己说现在外头天还亮着，以此让自己镇定下来。怪物从不在天亮时出门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maud brings in cookies. Mum serves coffee. Kent takes a gulp, pauses, and announces that it's rather strong. Alf sweeps down the whole cup in one go and mutters, "Just right!" Britt-Marie takes a tiny, tiny mouthful and rests the cup in the palm of her hand before offering her verdict: "I do think it's a little strong, personally." Then she throws a furtive glance at Mum and adds, "And you're drinking coffee, Ulrika, even though you're pregnant."

<div class="line_en">It was a Saturday and Granny and Elsa were going to an exhibition about dinosaurs.

She really lacks empathy sometimes, that woman.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our Friend had been lying on Granny's bed, like a sphinx outside a pyramid.

<div class="line_en">And so Elsa stood there, her usual scarf in the wash and in its place an ugly scarf chosen by her mother, worrying that vomit-green might provoke the beast. In the end Elsa had explained that it was her mum's scarf, not hers, and her mum had terrible taste, before backing away towards the door. Our Friend just stared at her. Or at least that was what Elsa thought, if she was right in thinking those were its eyes. And then it also bared its teeth, Elsa was almost sure of it. But Granny just muttered something about "kids, you know" and rolled her eyes at Our Friend. Then she went to find the keys to Renault and then she and Elsa went to the dinosaur exhibition. Granny left the front door wide open, Elsa remembers, and when they sat in Renault and Elsa asked what Our Friend was doing in Granny's flat, Granny just answered: "Visiting." When Elsa asked why it was always barking behind its door, Granny answered cheerily, "Barking? Ah, it only does that when Britt-Marie goes past." And when Elsa asked why, Granny grinned from ear to ear and answered: "Because that's what he likes doing."</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Elsa had asked who Our Friend lived with, and then Granny said: "Not everyone needs to live with someone, good God. For instance, I don't live with anybody."
