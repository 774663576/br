<div class="line_en">Upstairs, in Mariam's room, Zalmai was wound up. He bounced his new rubber basketball around for a while, on the floor, against the walls. Mariam asked him not to, but he knew that she had no authority to exert over him and so he went on bouncing his ball, his eyes holding hers defiantly. For a while, they pushed his toy car, an ambulance with bold red lettering on the sides, sending it back and forth between them across the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where is it?" he said. "Where is the ball Baba jan got me? Where is it? I want it! I want it!" his voice rising and becoming more shrill with each word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它在哪里？”他说，“亲爱的爸爸买给我的球在哪里？它在哪里？我想要它！我想要它！”他的声音变得越来越高，越来越尖厉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Earlier, when they had met Tariq at the door, Zalmai had clutched the basketball close to his chest and stuck a thumb in his mouth -- something he didn't do anymore except when he was apprehensive. He had eyed Tariq with suspicion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam was going to explain, say something about him and Laila growing up together, but Zalmai cut her off and said to turn the ambulance around, so the front grille faced him, and, when she did, he said he wanted his basketball again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was just here," Mariam said, and he cried, "No, it's lost, I know it. I just know it's lost! Where is it? Where is it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here," she said, fetching the ball from the closet where it had rolled to. But Zalmai was bawling now and pounding his fists, crying that it wasn't the same ball, it couldn't be, because his ball was lost, and this was a fake one, where had his real ball gone? Where? Where where where?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“给你。”她说，把球从它刚才滚进去的壁橱中拿了出来。但察尔迈伊不停地叫骂，用拳头擂地，哭着说它不是那个球，它不可能是那个球，因为他的球已经不见了，这个是假的，他那个真的篮球哪里去了？在哪里？在哪里？在哪里？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam waited outside the room. From atop the staircase, all she could see of Tariq were his long legs, the real one and the artificial one, in khaki pants, stretched out on the uncarpeted living-room floor. It was then that she realized why the doorman at the Continental had looked familiar the day she and Rasheed had gone there to place the call to Jalil. He'd been wearing a cap and sunglasses, that was why it hadn't come to her earlier. But Mariam remembered now, from nine years before, remembered him sitting downstairs, patting his brow with a handkerchief and asking for water. Now all manner of questions raced through her mind: Had the sulfa pills too been part of the ruse? Which one of them had plotted the lie, provided the convincing details? And how much had Rasheed paid Abdul Sharif -- if that was even his name -- to come and crush Laila with the story of Tariq's death?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆在房间外面等着。从楼梯的上方，她只能见到塔里克的两条长腿，真的那条和假的那条，穿着卡其裤，伸展在没有铺地毯的地板上。到了这个时候，她才想起来那天她和拉希德去洲际饭店给扎里勒打电话时，为什么会觉得那个门卫很面熟。他当时戴着帽子和太阳镜，所以她没有早点想起来。但玛丽雅姆现在记得了，她记得九年前，那个人就坐在楼下，不断用手帕擦额头，跟她要水喝。现在她脑海中涌起了各种各样的问题：那些磺胺片也是骗局的一部分吗？他们中哪个人想到了这个谎言，编出了这些细节？拉希德花了多少钱请阿卜杜拉·沙里夫——如果他真的叫这个名字的话——来用塔里克已经死亡的故事摧毁莱拉？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He screamed until Laila had to come upstairs to hold him, to rock him and run her fingers through his tight, dark curls, to dry his moist cheeks and cluck her tongue in his ear.</div>
