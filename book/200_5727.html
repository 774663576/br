<div class="line_en">Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over. As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and more prone to what Mrs. Weasley called "fits of the sullens", in which he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buckbeak's room for hours at a time. His gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kreacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic. Sirius said he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard. Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance, his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring at him avidly, but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that Harry had noticed.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="假期最后一天发生了一件事，让哈利真正害怕返校了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry didn't want to leave Sirius again with only Kreacher for company; in fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence; there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned, there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; and Dumbledore remained as remote as ever. In fact, if it hadn't been for the DA, Harry thought he might have begged Sirius to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不想留下小天狼星一个人跟克利切做伴。事实上，他生平第一次不再盼望着回霍格沃茨。返校意味着回到乌姆里奇的专制之下，她一定又强行通过了十来条法令。再说又没有魁地奇球赛可盼。考试I临近，作业量很可能又要增加。邓布利多还是那么遥远。要不是有D.A．，哈利觉得他可能会去求小天狼星让他离开霍格沃茨，留在格里莫广场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, dear," said Mrs. Weasley poking her head into his and Ron's bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione, Ginny and Crookshanks, "could you come down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利惊恐地张大了嘴巴。他望望其他几人，他们都目瞪口呆地看着他。赫敏好不容易才管住了一刻钟的克鲁克山，此时欢喜地跳到棋盘上，棋子尖叫着四散奔逃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That night's meal should have been a cheerful one, with Mr. Weasley back amongst them. Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George's jokes or offering everyone more food, his face fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr. Weasley their congratulations. He wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him he shouldn't listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them didn't think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place. But he had no opportunity to do so, and, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius's face, Harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance. Instead, he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.</div>

<div class="line_en">The shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously coloured potions. In one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry -- not without reason -- of robbing. Harry's attention was drawn towards the desk, however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognised it at once -- it was Dumbledore's Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing there, he jumped when Snape's cold voice came out of the shadows.</div>

<div class="line_en">Snape paused for a moment, apparently to savour the pleasure of insulting Harry, before continuing. "Only Muggles talk of 'mind-reading'. The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader, the mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter -- or at least, most minds are." He smirked. "It is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection."</div>

Twice more, Snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his behaviour, he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at the ready.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How do those hats work, then?" said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George closely. "I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object… I'd imagine the charm wouldn't have a very long life though."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那帽子是怎么做的？”赫敏也分了神，仔细观察着弗雷德和乔治，“显然是一种隐形咒，但把隐形区域扩大到施了魔法的物体之外是蛮聪明的…但我想这魔法不会持续太久…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He opened his eyes and, as he did so, he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth.

Ron was bending over him, looking very worried.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hermione told me to come and check on you," said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet. "She says your defences will be low at the moment, after Snape's been fiddling around with your mind… still, I suppose it'll help in the long run, won't it?" strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years.</div>
