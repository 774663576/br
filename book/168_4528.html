<div class="line_en">On the morning her new gown was to be ready, the serving maid filled Sansa's tub with steaming hot water and scrubbed her head to toe until she glowed pink. Cersei's own bedmaid trimmed her nails and brushed and curled her auburn hair so it fell down her back in soft ringlets. She brought a dozen of the queen's favorite scents as well. Sansa chose a sharp sweet fragrance with a hint of lemon in it under the smell of flowers. The maid dabbed some on her finger and touched Sansa behind each ear, and under her chin, and then lightly on her nipples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天早上，她的新裙服终于完工，女仆们用冒着蒸汽的热水注满浴盆，为她全身上下努力刷洗，直到皮肤变红。瑟曦派出自己的贴身侍女替她修剪指甲，理发梳洗，将她枣红的秀发做成轻柔的小卷儿搭在背上。这位侍女还带来太后最喜欢的十来种香精，珊莎从中选出一瓶甜腻浓烈的花露水，混合着一丝柠檬的味道。侍女把香水倒在指尖，在她双耳、下巴和乳头上各一轻触。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cersei herself arrived with the seamstress, and watched as they dressed Sansa in her new clothes. The smallclothes were all silk, but the gown itself was ivory samite and cloth-of-silver, and lined with silvery satin. The points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she lowered her arms. And it was a woman's gown, not a little girl's, there was no doubt of that. The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep vee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey. The skirts were long and full, the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold her breath as they laced her into it. They brought her new shoes as well, slippers of soft grey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers. "You are very beautiful, my lady," the seamstress said when she was dressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后瑟曦带着女裁缝亲自到场，品评珊莎着装。内衣全是丝绸，裙服本身则由象牙色锦绣和银线编织，银色缎子镶边。当她放下胳膊，长袖快触到地板。这是成年女人的衣服，不是小姑娘家的，对此她很确定。紧身胸衣的V形开头几乎露到小腹，它由装饰繁复的密尔蕾丝织成，颜色是鸽子灰。裙子本身则又长又大，腰围极细，珊莎不得不屏住呼吸以便他们为她系紧缚带。她的新鞋子是浅灰色鹿皮拖鞋，缠在脚上，好似爱侣。“您真是太美了，小姐，”裁缝评论。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="看着发网挂在珊莎耳际，覆到脖子上，太后满意地点点头。“好，很好。诸神眷顾你呀，珊莎，将你造得这般美丽。把这么一位甜美纯真的女孩送给那个怪物，真叫人难以心安。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？是吗？”珊莎格格娇笑，一边旋身雀跃，裙裾飞舞婆娑。“噢，噢！”她简直等不及要让维拉斯看到了！他会爱上我的，会的，一定会的…他一定会忘了临冬城，爱上我这个人。噢！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cersei Lannister ignored the question. "The cloak," she commanded, and the women brought it out: a long cloak of white velvet heavy with pearls. A flerce direwolf was embroidered upon it in silver thread. Sansa looked at it with sudden dread. "Your father's colors," said Cersei, as they fastened it about her neck with a slender silver chain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑟曦·兰尼斯特没有回答。“把斗篷拿来，”她下令，女仆们便遵命行事——这是一件装饰着无数珍珠的白天鹅绒长斗篷，上面用银线绣有一只凶猛的冰原狼。珊莎只消看它一眼，便突然恐惧起来。“这是你家族的颜色，”瑟曦道，女仆们则用一根纤细的银链在她脖子上系紧斗篷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa tried to run, but Cersei's handmaid caught her before she'd gone a yard. Ser Meryn Trant gave her a look that made her cringe, but Kettleblack touched her almost gently and said, "Do as you're told, sweetling, it won't be so bad. Wolves are supposed to be brave, aren't they?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎拔腿就跑，没出一码就被瑟曦的侍女抓住。马林·特兰爵士恨恨瞪了她一眼，让她不禁畏缩，凯特布莱克则轻轻碰了碰她，道：“照陛下说的做，小可爱，一切没那么坏。冰原狼应该勇敢，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Afterward, she could not remember leaving the room or descending the steps or crossing the yard. It seemed to take all her attention just to put one foot down in front of the other. Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund walked beside her, in cloaks as pale as her own, lacking only the pearls and the direwolf that had been her father's. Joffrey himself was waiting for her on the steps of the castle sept. The king was resplendent in crimson and gold, his crown on his head. "I'm your father today," he announced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走了，但整个脑海模模糊糊，记不得如何离开房间，如何走下阶梯，如何穿过庭院，惟一的想法就是强迫自己一步、又一步。马林爵士和奥斯蒙爵士把她夹在中间，他们身上的披风和她的新娘斗篷一般惨白，只是没有珠宝和冰原狼家徽。乔佛里在城堡圣堂外的阶梯上等她，他戴着王冠，一身绯红和金色的打扮，颇为耀眼。“今天，我就是你的父亲，”他宣布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brave. Sansa took a deep breath. I am a Stark, yes, I can be brave.

<div class="line_en">"My lady, this is no way to bring you to your wedding. I am sorry for that. And for making this so sudden, and so secret. My lord father felt it necessary, for reasons of state. Else I would have come to you sooner, as I wished." He waddled closer. "You did not ask for this marriage, I know. No more than I did. if I had refused you, however, they would have wed you to my cousin Lancel. Perhaps you would prefer that. He is nearer your age, and fairer to look upon. If that is your wish, say so, and I will end this farce."</div>

<div class="line_en">So she put her hand in his, and he led her to the marriage altar, where the septon waited between the Mother and the Father to join their lives together. She saw Dontos in his fool's motley, looking at her with big round eyes. Ser Balon Swann and Ser Boros Blount were there in Kingsguard white, but not Ser Loras. None of the Tyrells are here, she realized suddenly. But there were other witnesses aplenty; the eunuch Varys, Ser Addarn Marbrand, Lord Philip Foote, Ser Bronn, Jalabhar Xho, a dozen others. Lord Gyles was coughing, Lady Ermesande was at the breast, and Lady Tanda's pregnant daughter was sobbing for no apparent reason.</div>

There were prayers and vows and singing, and tall candles burning, a hundred dancing lights that the tears in her eyes transformed into a thousand.

<div class="line_cn" title="作为国王，乔佛里代替了父亲艾德·史塔克公爵的位置。当他的手摸到她的肩膀，朝斗篷的钩扣伸去时，她僵硬得像根长枪。一只手扫过乳房，在上面捏了一下，接着她的新娘斗篷便解开了，乔佛里将其优雅而夸张地扫下，露齿而笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His uncle's part went less well. The bride's cloak he held was huge and heavy, crimson velvet richly worked with lions and bordered with gold satin and rubies. No one had thought to bring a stool, however, and Tyrion stood a foot and a half shorter than his bride. As he moved behind her, Sansa felt a sharp tug on her skirt. He wants me to kneel, she realized, blushing. She was mortified. It was not supposed to be this way. She had dreamed of her wedding a thousand times, and always she had pictured how her betrothed would stand behind her tall and strong, sweep the cloak of his protection over her shoulders, and tenderly kiss her cheek as he leaned forward to fasten the clasp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他舅舅则没他这份从容。提利昂穿的新郎斗篷又厚又重，红天鹅绒上绣着无数狮子，边沿是金色缎子与红宝石。没人帮忙，没人搬来一把凳子，而新郎比新娘整整矮了一尺半。他走到她身后，珊莎感到他用力拉她的裙子。他要我跪下，想到这，她不禁面颊通红。事情不该这样的。她上千次梦见自己的婚礼，梦见自己的未婚夫强壮而挺拔，高高地站在面前，将自己的斗篷披在她肩膀，表示永远的守护。随后，他一边靠过来为她系钩扣，一边轻轻吻她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wedding feast was held in the Small Hall. There were perhaps fifty guests; Lannister retainers and allies for the most part, joining those who had been at the wedding. And here Sansa found the Tyrells. Margaery gave her such a sad look, and when the Queen of Thoms tottered in between Left and Right, she never looked at her at all. Elinor, Alla, and Megga seemed determined not to know her. My friends, Sansa thought bitterly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her husband drank heavily and ate but little. He listened whenever someone rose to make a toast and sometimes nodded a curt acknowledgment, but otherwise his face might have been made of stone. The feast seemed to go on forever, though Sansa tasted none of the food. She wanted it to be done, and yet she dreaded its end. For after the feast would come the bedding. The men would carry her up to her wedding bed, undressing her on the way and making rude jokes about the fate that awaited her between the sheets, while the women did Tyrion the same honors. Only after they had been bundled naked into bed would they be left alone, and even then the guests would stand outside the bridal chamber, shouting ribald suggestions through the door. The bedding had seemed wonderfully wicked and exciting when Sansa was a girl, but now that the moment was upon her she felt only dread. She did not think she could bear for them to rip off her clothes, and she was certain she would burst into tears at the first randy jape.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hands trembled as she began fumbling at her clothes. She had ten thumbs instead of fingers, and all of them were broken. Yet somehow she managed the laces and buttons, and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the floor, until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes. Gooseprickles covered her arms and legs. She kept her eyes on the floor, too shy to look at him, but when she was done she glanced up and found him staring. There was hunger in his green eye, it seemed to her, and fury in the black. Sansa did not know which scared her more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开始脱衣服，手不住颤抖，好象没有指头，只剩十根千疮百孔的木桩。最后她终于勉力解开扣子和衣带，任斗篷、裙服、腰带和衬裙滑到地上。接着脱内衣，手臂和大腿都起了鸡皮疙瘩。她望向地板，羞得不敢看丈夫，等脱光后才扫了一眼，发现他正目不转睛地瞪着她瞧。碧眼里闪动着饥渴，黑眼里则是怒火。珊莎说不准哪边更可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pushed himself to his feet. "Don't lie, Sansa. I am malformed, scarred, and small, but…" she could see him groping "… abed, when the candles are blown out, I am made no worse than other men. In the dark, I am the Knight of Flowers." He took a draught of wine. "I am generous. Loyal to those who are loyal to me. I've proven I'm no craven. And I am cleverer than most, surely wits count for something. I can even be kind. Kindness is not a habit with us Lannisters, I fear, but I know I have some somewhere. I could be… I could be good to you."</div>

<div class="line_en">She climbed onto the featherbed, conscious of his stare. A scented beeswax candle burned on the bedside table and rose petals had been strewn between the sheets. She had started to pull up a blanket to cover herself when she heard him say, "No."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她爬上羽床，觉察到他继续瞪着她。床边小桌上燃着一只加香料的蜂蜡烛，被单间撒了无数玫瑰花瓣。她牵起毯子，想盖住身体，只听丈夫道：“不。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he finally realized that she had no answer for him, Tyrion Lannister drained the last of his wine. "I understand," he said bitterly. "Get in the bed, Sansa. We need to do our duty."</div>

<div class="line_en">The cold made her shiver, but she obeyed. Her eyes closed, and she waited. After a moment she heard the sound of her husband pulling off his boots, and the rustle of clothing as he undressed himself. When he hopped up on the bed and put his hand on her breast, Sansa could not help but shudder. She lay with her eyes closed, every muscle tense, dreading what might come next.

<div class="line_cn" title="她觉得很冷，但还是顺从了，同时闭上眼睛，静静地等待。过了片刻，她听见丈夫脱下鞋子，随后是脱衣服的沙沙声。当他跳上床，将手放到她乳房上时，珊莎再次发起抖来。她紧紧闭上眼睛，每块肌肉都紧蹦，内心恐惧着即将发生的事。他会再摸她吗？会吻她么？我应该打开双腿吗？她不知该怎么做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had promised to obey; she opened her eyes. He was sitting by her feet, naked. Where his legs joined, his man's staff poked up stiff and hard from a thicket of coarse yellow hair, but it was the only thing about him that was straight.</div>

She stared at the stunted legs, the swollen brutish brow, the green eye and the black one, the raw stump of his nose and crooked pink scar, the coarse tangle of black and gold hair that passed for his beard. Even his manhood was ugly, thick and veined, with a bulbous purple head. This is not right, this is not fair, how have I sinned that the gods would do this to me, how?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看着他，珊莎告诉自己，看着自己的丈夫，好好了解他。茉丹修女说过，每个男人都有其可爱之处，去发现他的优点吧，努力观察。于是她瞧向丈夫矮短的双腿、浮胀的额头、一碧一黑的眼睛和满头满脸的金发金须。好丑哦，连他的男根也一样，又大又长，脉络突出，带一个涨成深紫色的头。不对，不对，他哪有一点美？我到底造了什么孽，上天要我嫁给他？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“原来如此，”他说，“原来如此，这就是诸神造妓女的原因罢。”他将粗短的指头握成拳，从床上爬了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
