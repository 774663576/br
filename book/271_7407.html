<div class="line_en">I moved slowly as I pulled Renesmee -- fast asleep; we'd been gone all day -- from the car. We'd left Jacob at Charlie's -- he'd said he was going to catch a ride home with Sue. I wondered if he was trying to fill his head with enough trivia to crowd out the image of the way my face had looked when I'd walked through Charlie's door.</div>

<div class="line_en">I tried to focus on the positives. There was a good chance that my daughter was going to survive what was coming, and Jacob, too. If they had a future, then that was a kind of victory, wasn't it? Our little band must be going to hold their own if Jacob and Renesmee were going to have the opportunity to run in the first place. Yes, Alice's strategy only made sense if we were going to put up a really good fight. So, a kind of victory there, too, considering that the Volturi had never been seriously challenged in millennia.</div>

<div class="line_en">We went to see Charlie on Christmas Day, Edward, Renesmee, Jacob, and I. All of Jacob's pack were there, plus Sam, Emily, and Sue. It was a big help to have them there in Charlie's little rooms, their huge, warm bodies wedged into corners around his sparsely decorated tree -- you could see exactly where he'd gotten bored and quit -- and overflowing his furniture. You could always count on werewolves to be buzzed about a coming fight, no matter how suicidal. The electricity of their excitement provided a nice current that disguised my utter lack of spirit. Edward was, as always, a better actor than I was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞节的时候我们去了查理家，爱德华，蕾妮斯梅，雅各布和我。还有雅各布的狼群，再加上山姆，Emily和苏。能有他们在这真好，他们庞大的身体挤在查理的小房子里，将体内的热量充斥到那棵稀稀拉拉的圣诞树上的每一个空隙——可以看出查理对那些束手无策——并从他的家具里满溢出来。你总是能听到狼人们对将要到来的战斗叽叽喳喳兴奋不已，不管那是多么毁灭性的行动。他们的兴奋正好为我的无精打采做了很好的掩护。而爱德华，还是和往常一样，是个比我好得多的演员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward had saved the day by ordering a gift for Charlie, too. It had shown up yesterday -- priority overnight shipping -- and Charlie spent all morning reading the thick instruction manual to his new fishing sonar system.</div>

<div class="line_en">Renesmee wore the locket I'd given her at dawn, and in her jacket pocket was the MP3 player Edward had given her -- a tiny thing that held five thousand songs, already filled with Edward's favorites. On her wrist was an intricately braided Quileute version of a promise ring. Edward had gritted his teeth over that one, but it didn't bother me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蕾妮斯梅戴着我黎明时送给她的吊坠盒，口袋里装着爱德华给她的MP3——一个塞满了爱德华最爱的5000多首歌的小东西。手腕上戴着镶有繁复的奎尔尤特人家族纹饰的手镯。爱德华恨不得拿牙齿把那玩意咬烂，我倒是无所谓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think Edward and Jacob both were as relieved as I was when it was time to go. It felt odd to spend energy on the human facade when there were so many more important things to be doing. I had a hard time concentrating. At the same time, this was perhaps the last time I would see Charlie. Maybe it was a good thing that I was too numb to really register that.</div>

<div class="line_en">From the way the werewolves ate, Sue's lunch spread must have been good. I wondered how the gathering would have looked to an outsider. Did we play our parts well enough? Would a stranger have thought us a happy circle of friends, enjoying the holiday with casual cheer?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shh," he hushed me. "Don't panic. And don't worry about Alec. What he does is no different than what Jane or Zafrina does. It's just an illusion -- he can't get inside your head any more than I can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘘，”他安慰我。“别慌。也别担心亚历克。他和简或查弗丽娜做的没什么不一样，只是种幻觉而已——我都不能进入你的脑袋，他更不能。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But what if I can't protect anything?" I whispered in gasps. "This thing I do, it's faulty, it's erratic! There's no rhyme or reason to it. Maybe it will do nothing against Alec at all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但如果我什么都保护不了怎么办？”我喘着气小声说道。“我做的这些，是有缺陷的，不稳定的，完全无规律可循。也许对亚历克根本起不了作用。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But Renesmee does!" I hissed frantically through my teeth. "It seemed so natural, I never questioned it before. It's always been just part of who she is. But she puts her thoughts right into my head just like she does with everyone else. My shield has holes, Edward!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但蕾妮斯梅可以！”我近乎狂乱地说，不住地发出嘶嘶的声音。“一切都那么自然，我以前从未对这种现象产生过疑问，就好像是她存在的一部分。但她能直接把思想放进我的脑袋里，和对其他人那样做没什么两样。我的盾是有漏洞的，爱德华！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stared at him desperately, waiting for him to acknowledge my terrible revelation. His lips were pursed, as if he was trying to decide how to phrase something. His expression was perfectly relaxed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我焦躁地盯着爱德华，等着他承认这个糟糕的真相。他抿着嘴唇，好像在思索着如何组织语言，表情非常放松。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You thought of this a long time ago, didn't you?" I demanded, feeling like an idiot for my months of overlooking the obvious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你思考这个问题已经很久了，不是吗？”我问，感觉自己在这么明显的事实前一直像个傻瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, she's your daughter," he pointed out. "Genetically half you. I used to tease you about how your mind was on a different frequency than the rest of ours. Perhaps she runs on the same."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样说吧，她是你的女儿，”他指出，“自然有你的一半血统。我以前不是经常逗你，说你的脑波频率和其他人不一样吗，也许她和你一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded, a faint smile pulling up one corner of his mouth. "The first time she touched you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点头，嘴唇上翘，微笑起来。“自从她第一次碰你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Give me the least likely first."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先告诉我那个可能性最小的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sighed at my own stupidity, but his calm had mellowed me some. "And this doesn't bother you? You don't see it as a problem?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我为自己的愚蠢叹了口气，但他平静的表情让我稍微缓和了些。“但这没让你困扰？你没觉得这是个问题？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have two theories, one more likely than the other."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有两种见解，其中一个比另一个可能性大很多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He put a finger to my lips. "I've considered that. Which is why I think this next theory is much more likely."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华用手指轻轻按住我的嘴唇。“我考虑过那个。也就是为什么我说另一种见解可能性大得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. And so I wondered. Maybe she took your talent and flipped it, too." I considered that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。然后我就开始怀疑，也许她也继承了你的天赋然后将它反过来了。”我想了想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I shuddered to think of Renesmee so close to Aro's greedy, milky eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一想到蕾妮斯梅离阿罗那贪婪浑浊的眼睛那么近，我不禁战栗起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's my theory," he said. "And if she can get into your head, I doubt there's a shield on the planet who could keep her at bay. That will help. From what we've seen, no one can doubt the truth of her thoughts once they've allowed her to show them. And I think no one can keep her from showing them, if she gets close enough. If Aro allows her to explain…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是我的见解。”他说，“而且，既然她能进入你的脑袋，我怀疑地球上没有什么盾能隔开她了。这恰好也说明了一些事情，如我们至此所看到的，只要人们允许了她的触碰，就没有人怀疑过她呈现的记忆的真实性。再进一步，如果她离得够近的话，我怀疑根本没有谁能拒绝她的呈现。那么如果阿罗允许她解释…”">查看中文翻译</div>
