<div class="line_en">And these bodiless phantoms of his life appeared with terrible precision, with all the mad nearness of a vision. That which was five years gone came within the touch of his hand, and he ceased at that moment to believe in his own existence. He expected some one to wake him; he would hear Gant's great voice below the laden vines, would gaze sleepily from the porch into the rich low moon, and go obediently to bed. But still there would be all that he remembered before that and what if -- Cause flowed ceaselessly into cause.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mountains were his masters. They rimmed in life. They were the cup of reality, beyond growth, beyond struggle and death. They were his absolute unity in the midst of eternal change. Old haunt-eyed faces glimmered in his memory. He thought of Swain's cow, St. Louis, death, himself in the cradle. He was the haunter of himself, trying for a moment to recover what he had been part of. He did not understand change, he did not understand growth. He stared at his framed baby picture in the parlor, and turned away sick with fear and the effort to touch, retain, grasp himself for only a moment.</div>

<div class="line_en">He heard the ghostly ticking of his life; his powerful clairvoyance, the wild Scotch gift of Eliza, burned inward back across the phantom years, plucking out of the ghostly shadows a million gleams of light -- a little station by the rails at dawn, the road cleft through the pineland seen at twilight, a smoky cabin-light below the trestles, a boy who ran among the bounding calves, a wisp-haired slattern, with snuff-sticked mouth, framed in a door, floury negroes unloading sacks from freight-cars on a shed, the man who drove the Fair Grounds bus at Saint Louis, a cool-lipped lake at dawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听见了自己生命之钟发出的可怕嘀嗒声；他从伊丽莎那里遗传获得的苏格兰民族能知过去未来的洞察力，使他内心燃起了熊熊的火炬。穿透如影的岁月，在可怕的影子里采来万缕灿烂的辉光——黄昏时分铁道旁边的小站；晨曦中透过松林延伸的岔道；高架桥下小屋里透出的微光；随着牛群一起向前奔跑的男孩；靠在门框上、蓬头垢面的妇人；满身面粉的黑人从货车上卸下一袋袋的货物；圣路易博览会上开巴士的司机；晨雾中清新凉爽的湖水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His life coiled back into the brown murk of the past like a twined filament of electric wire; he gave life, a pattern, and movement to these million sensations that Chance, the loss or gain of a moment, the turn of the head, the enormous and aimless impulsion of accident, had thrust into the blazing heat of him. His mind picked out in white living brightness these pinpoints of experience and the ghostliness of all things else became more awful because of them. So many of the sensations that returned to open haunting vistas of fantasy and imagining had been caught from a whirling landscape through the windows of the train.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的生命就像两根扭在一起的电线丝、缠向暗淡的过去；他赋予那些数不清的感触以生命、模式和动力。猛然回首之间，各种事件带来的巨大、无目标的冲击，在他身体里形成炽热的火焰。这些微小的生活体验在他的脑海里忽然闪亮并活跃起来，使其他一切事物更显得模糊而可怕。他透过火车的窗户，看着外面急速向后倒去的风景，想起了难以计数的回忆和幻想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And it was this that awed him -- the weird combination of fixity and change, the terrible moment of immobility stamped with eternity in which, passing life at great speed, both the observer and the observed seem frozen in time. There was one moment of timeless suspension when the land did not move, the train did not move, the slattern in the doorway did not move, he did not move. It was as if God had lifted his baton sharply above the endless orchestration of the seas, and the eternal movement had stopped, suspended in the timeless architecture of the absolute. Or like those motion-pictures that describe the movements of a swimmer making a dive, or a horse taking a hedge -- movement is petrified suddenly in mid-air, the inexorable completion of an act is arrested. Then, completing its parabola, the suspended body plops down into the pool. Only, these images that burnt in him existed without beginning or ending, without the essential structure of time. Fixed in no-time, the slattern vanished, fixed, without a moment of transition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正是这动与静的结合令他惊奇不已。人生百态全都以极高的速度从眼前一一闪过，同时在这一刻又静止不动、与永恒铭刻在一起，观察者与被观察的一切事物似乎全都冰封在时间里。这是一个时间悬置的瞬间：大地静止，火车停止，倚靠门框站立的懒女人一动不动，他自己也静止不动。就像上帝在指挥无边无际、波涛起伏的交响乐，忽然永恒的乐声戛然而止，悬停在没有时间的绝对维度里。或者说，这一切就像拍摄电影时选取的一个游泳者跳水的镜头，或者就像一匹骏马正打算跨越障碍——突然间整个运动画面凝固在半空中，那个原先势在必行的动作突然停了下来。接着，在完成了抛物线的轨迹之后，悬在半空中的人便扑通一声掉落进了水池中。只有这些景象仍然在他的心中燃烧，无始无终。不知从什么时候开始，那个懒妇消失了，一切凝固了，没有任何的过渡时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fusion of the two strong egotisms, Eliza's inbrooding and Gant's expanding outward, made of him a fanatical zealot in the religion of Chance. Beyond all misuse, waste, pain, tragedy, death, confusion, unswerving necessity was on the rails; not a sparrow fell through the air but that its repercussion acted on his life, and the lonely light that fell upon the viscous and interminable seas at dawn awoke sea-changes washing life to him. The fish swam upward from the depth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, business had been fairly good. Eliza's earning power the first few years at Dixieland had been injured by her illnesses. Now, however, she had recovered, and had paid off the last installment on the house. It was entirely hers. The property at this time was worth perhaps $12,000. In addition she had borrowed $3,500 on a twenty-year $5,000 life insurance policy that had only two years more to run, and had made extensive alterations: she had added a large sleeping-porch upstairs, tacked on two rooms, a bath, and a hallway on one side, and extended a hallway, adding three bedrooms, two baths, and a water-closet, on the other. Downstairs she had widened the veranda, put in a large sun-parlor under the sleeping-porch, knocked out the archway in the dining-room, which she prepared to use as a big bedroom in the slack season, scooped out a small pantry in which the family was to eat, and added a tiny room beside the kitchen for her own occupancy.</div>

<div class="line_en">The construction was after her own plans, and of the cheapest material: it never lost the smell of raw wood, cheap varnish, and flimsy rough plastering, but she had added eight or ten rooms at a cost of only $3,000. The year before she had banked almost $2,000 -- her bank account was almost $5,000. In addition, she owned jointly with Gant the shop on the Square, which had thirty feet of frontage, and was valued at $20,000, from which he got $65 a month in rent; $20 from Jannadeau, $25 from the McLean Plumbing Company in the basement, and $20 from the J. N. Gillespie Printing Co., which occupied all of the second story. There were, besides, three good building-lots on Merrion Avenue valued at $2,000 apiece, or at $5,500 for all three; the house on Woodson Street valued at $5,000; 110 acres of wooded mountainside with a farm-house, several hundred peach, apple and cherry trees, and a few acres of arable ground for which Gant received $120 a year in rent, and which they valued at $50 an acre, $5,500; two houses, one on Carter Street, and one on Duncan, rented to railway people, for which they received $25 a month apiece, and which they valued together at $4,500; forty-eight acres of land two miles above Biltburn, and four from Altamont, upon the important Reynoldsville Road, which they valued at $210 an acre, or $10,000; three houses in Niggertown -- one on lower Valley Street, one on Beaumont Crescent, just below the negro Johnson's big house, and one on Short Oak, valued at $600, $900, and $1,600 respectively, and drawing a room-rental of $8, $12, and $17 a month (total: $3,100 and $37 rental); two houses across the river, four miles away in West Altamont, valued at $2,750 and at $3,500, drawing a rental of $22 and $30 a month; three lots, lost in the growth of a rough hillside, a mile from the main highway through West Altamont, $500; and a house, unoccupied, object of Gantian anathema, on Lower Hatton Avenue, $4,500.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus, at the beginning of 1912, before the rapid and intensive development of Southern industry, and the consequent tripling of Altamont's population, and before the multiplication of her land values, the wealth of Gant and Eliza amounted to about $100,000, the great bulk of which was solidly founded in juicy well chosen pieces of property of Eliza's selection, yielding them a monthly rental of more than $200, which, added to their own earning capacities at the shop and Dixieland, gave them a combined yearly income of $8,000 or $10,000. Although Gant often cried out bitterly against his business and declared, when he was not attacking property, that he had never made even a bare living from his tombstones, he was rarely short of ready money: he usually had one or two small commissions from country people, and he always carried a well-filled purse, containing $150 or $200 in five -- and ten-dollar bills, which he allowed Eugene to count out frequently, enjoying his son's delight, and the feel of abundance.</div>

Ben, scowling, with a quick flicker of his mouth, drew back his hard white hand swiftly as if to cuff his brother.

<div class="line_en">Stuck on a thin undeveloped neck beneath a big wide-browed head covered thickly by curling hair which had changed, since his infancy, from a light maple to dark brown-black, was a face so small, and so delicately sculptured, that it seemed not to belong to its body. The strangeness, the remote quality of this face was enhanced by its brooding fabulous concentration, by its passionate dark intensity, across which every splinter of thought or sensation flashed like a streak of light across a pool. The mouth was full, sensual, extraordinarily mobile, the lower lip deeply scooped and pouting. His rapt dreaming intensity set the face usually in an expression of almost sullen contemplation; he smiled, oftener than he laughed, inwardly, at some extravagant invention, or some recollection of the absurd, now fully appreciated for the first time. He did not open his lips to smile -- there was a swift twisted flicker across his mouth. His thick heavily arched eyebrows grew straight across the base of his nose.</div>

His hair had been cut when he was nine years old, after a bitter siege against Eliza's obstinacy. He no longer suffered because of the curls. But he had grown like a weed, he already topped his mother by an inch or two; his body was big-boned but very thin and fragile, with no meat on it; his legs were absurdly long, thin, and straight, giving him a curious scissored look as he walked with long bounding strides.</div>

<div class="line_en">That Spring he was more alone than ever. Eliza's departure for Dixieland three or four years before, and the disruption of established life at Gant's, had begun the loosening of his first friendships with the neighborhood boys, Harry Tarkinton, Max Isaacs, and the others, and had now almost completely severed them. Occasionally he saw these boys again, occasionally he resumed again, at sporadic intervals, his association with them, but he now had no steady companionship, he had only a series of associations with children whose parents stayed for a time at Dixieland, with Tim O'Doyle, whose mother ran the Brunswick, with children here and there who briefly held his interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年春天是他最孤独的时候。自从伊丽莎三四年前离家开南都旅馆以后，甘特家原有的秩序几乎彻底瓦解了。他和最初结识的几个邻家小朋友之间的友谊也日渐疏远了，包括哈里·塔金顿和迈克斯·艾萨克等。他现在几乎已经跟他们中断了往来。他偶尔还能见到他们，有时候他也会和他们一起去玩耍。但是他现在没有了固定的伙伴，只能和某些住在南都旅馆的房客带来的小孩为朋友，要么就找街对面布伦斯维克公寓的奥道尔夫人之子蒂姆·奥道尔，或者其他偶然结识的孩子玩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he became passionately bored with them, plunged into a miasmic swamp of weariness and horror, after a time, because of the dullness and ugliness of their lives, their minds, their amusements. Dull people filled him with terror: he was never so much frightened by tedium in his own life as in the lives of others -- his early distaste for Pett Pentland and her grim rusty aunts came from submerged memories of the old house on Central Avenue, the smell of mellow apples and medicine in the hot room, the swooping howl of the wind outside, and the endless monotone of their conversation on disease, death, and misery. He was filled with terror and anger against them because they were able to live, to thrive, in this horrible depression that sickened him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是他渐渐开始讨厌起这些人来。他们在一起相处没多长时间，由于他们在生活、思想和兴趣方面既乏味又无聊，他感到跟他们待在一起会使他陷入厌倦和恐怖的泥沼。乏味的人会让他害怕，他并不怕自己生活的苦闷，倒很害怕别人生活的索然无趣。他从小就讨厌佩蒂·彭特兰，还有她那些住在中央大街老房子里、苍老、迟钝的姑姑婶婶们。闷热的屋子里充满了烂苹果和浓烈的药味。门外狂风呼啸，室内那些老妇们唠唠叨叨、没完没了地谈着疾病、死亡、苦难等话题。他内心充满了恐惧和愤怒，因为在这个令他恶心、可怕、阴郁的气氛中，她们倒生活得有滋有味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Or, returning from some country walk in late autumn, he would come back from Cove or Valley with dewy nose, clotted boots, the smell of a mashed persimmon on his knee, and the odor of wet earth and grass on the palms of his hands, and with a stubborn dislike and suspicion of the scene he had visited, and fear of the people who lived there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许在某年的晚秋时节，他从乡下步行回来，走出某个幽谷，鼻子上挂着露珠，靴子上沾着泥土，膝盖上沾着烂柿子的气味，手心里留着青草和湿土的味道。当天所见的情景在他的脑海里留下了不可磨灭的印象，他开始怀疑自己的眼睛，内心非常不悦；他一想起在那里见到的人就会心有余悸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus, the entire landscape, the whole physical background of his life, was now dappled by powerful prejudices of liking and distaste formed, God knows how, or by what intangible affinities of thought, feeling and connotation. Thus, one street would seem to him to be a "good street"-- to exist in the rich light of cheerful, abundant, and high-hearted living; another, inexplicably, a "bad street," touching him somehow with fear, hopelessness, depression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这一刻，他一生的所有片段和全部的背景都因为自己的好恶而划分得清清楚楚。这种主观和偏见，谁也不清楚是怎么形成的，也不知道是用如何微妙的思想情感和联想构成的。比如说，根据这种倾向，某条街在他眼里就是一条“好街”——那里满是快乐开心、丰富多彩的生活；而另一条街，莫名其妙地成了“坏街”，往往令他恐惧、失望和沮丧，其中的原因却不得而知。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps the cold red light of some remembered winter's afternoon, waning pallidly over a playing-field, with all its mockery of Spring, while lights flared up smokily in houses, the rabble-rout of children dirtily went in to supper, and men came back to the dull but warm imprisonment of home, oil lamps (which he hated), and bedtime, clotted in him a hatred of the place which remained even when the sensations that caused it were forgotten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在记忆中某个冬日的下午，红色的夕阳冷冷地照在操场上，显得苍白而无力，好像在嘲弄即将到来的春天。家家户户已经亮起了昏黄的灯光，一群脏兮兮的孩子开始回家吃晚饭，大人们也结束了一天的劳作，回到了单调无聊、暖意融融、如同监狱的家里。他们点起油灯（他不喜欢的东西），然后上床睡觉。也许正是这些情景在他胸中不断地累积才构成了他对这个地方的厌恶。虽然当初的厌恶心理早已经淡去，但是直到现在，厌恶的阴影依然存在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had the most extraordinary love of incandescence. He hated dull lights, smoky lights, soft, or sombre lights. At night he wanted to be in rooms brilliantly illuminated with beautiful, blazing, sharp, poignant lights. After that, the dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知什么原因，他特别喜欢被灯火照得到处光亮一片。他不喜欢单调昏暗的灯光、烟雾蒙蒙的灯光，不喜欢柔和、阴沉的灯光。一到晚上，他喜欢在屋内点起明亮、刺目的灯来，把屋子照得如同白昼。然后，他才会熄灯进入彻底的黑暗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He played games badly, although he took a violent interest in sports. Max Isaacs continued to interest him as an athlete long after he had ceased to interest him as a person. The game Max Isaacs excelled in was baseball. Usually he played one of the outfield positions, ranging easily about in his field, when a ball was hit to him, with the speed of a panther, making impossible catches with effortless grace. He was a terrific hitter, standing at the plate casually but alertly, and meeting the ball squarely with a level swinging smack of his heavy shoulders. Eugene tried vainly to imitate the precision and power of this movement, which drove the ball in a smoking arc out of the lot, but he was never able: he chopped down clumsily and blindly, knocking a futile bounder to some nimble baseman. In the field he was equally useless: he never learned to play in a team, to become a limb of that single animal which united telepathically in a concerted movement. He became nervous, highly excited, and erratic in team-play, but he spent hours alone with another boy, or, after the mid-day meal, with Ben, passing a ball back and forth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他打球的技术很差，但却对体育运动喜欢得不得了。他对迈克斯·艾萨克这个人已经不感兴趣，却对运动员身份的他颇感兴趣。迈克斯最擅长棒球，通常打的是外场的位置。在球场上他身手矫健，轻快地跑来跑去；一旦有球向他打过来，他的反应就和黑豹一样敏捷，不管多险的球他都能从容接住。他也是一位凶猛的投手，他站在垒后，神态自若，动作灵巧。球飞过来的时候他用结实有力的肩膀猛地一挥球棒，把球打个正着。尤金特别想模仿他这个动作，将球准确、有力地打出场外，但是怎么都学不会。他往往笨手笨脚地把球打在地上乱滚，对方守垒的球员很轻易就封杀了。他做外场手的时候举止同样蠢笨，他就是学不会和大家一起并肩战斗，无法像动物的肢体那样，彼此默契、协调统一、运用自如。每到团体打球的时候，他总会很紧张，失误频频。所以他经常单独约另一个孩子打球，要么在午饭后约上本恩，两人一来一往地掷球，一玩就玩好几个钟头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he was in no way able to submit himself to the discipline, the hard labor, the acceptance of defeat and failure that make a good athlete; he wanted always to win, he wanted always to be the general, the heroic spear-head of victory. And after that he wanted to be loved. Victory and love. In all of his swarming fantasies Eugene saw himself like this -- unbeaten and beloved. But moments of clear vision returned to him when all the defeat and misery of his life was revealed. He saw his gangling and absurd figure, his remote unpractical brooding face, too like a dark strange flower to arouse any feeling among his companions and his kin, he thought, but discomfort, bitterness, and mockery; he remembered, with a drained sick heart, the countless humiliations, physical and verbal, he had endured, at the hands of school and family, before the world, and as he thought, the horns of victory died within the wood, the battle-drums of triumph stopped, the proud clangor of the gongs quivered away in silence. His eagles had flown; he saw himself, in a moment of reason, as a madman playing Cæsar. He craned his head aside and covered his face with his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但实际上，他绝对受不了那种艰苦的训练和严格的纪律，难以接受优秀运动员必须坦然面对的胜利和失败；他要么不打球，要打就一定要赢，而且还要做带队的英雄。获得胜利后他希望有美人来爱他。胜利与爱情，这就是尤金满脑子的幻想——战无不胜，受人爱戴。可当他以往所有的失败与痛苦在眼前显示出来时，他又会恢复片刻的清醒。他看见自己瘦长、笨手笨脚的古怪身材，看见自己整天脱离现实、出神沉思的面孔，简直就像一朵神秘古怪的花，难以引起同伴或亲戚好友的好感，相反还会令他们不快，让他们难受、受他们嘲笑。一想到此，森林里吹起的胜利号角又开始化为乌有了，凯旋的战鼓也戛然而止，喧闹的锣声颤巍巍地消散在寂静中。心中的雄鹰已经高飞。在片刻的理智中，他觉得自己分明就是个疯子，站在那里冒充恺撒大帝。他感到无地自容，扭过脖子用手捂住了脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He developed blinding speed, bending all the young suppleness of his long thin body behind the ball, exulting as it smoked into the pocket of the mitt with a loud smack, or streaked up with a sharp dropping curve. Ben, taken by surprise by a fast drop, would curse him savagely, and in a rage hurl the ball back into his thin gloved hand. In the Spring and Summer he went as often as he could afford it, or was invited, to the baseball games in the district league, a fanatic partisan of the town club and its best players, making a fantasy constantly of himself in a heroic game-saving rôle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他终于学会投掷快球了。投球的时候，他那青春、富有弹性的瘦长身躯向前冲着，使出浑身的力气，砰的一声把球砸在捕手手套的正中心，好不得意，要不然就来个漂亮的弧线球，只见球嗖的一声从高处直落下来。本恩对高处落下的球提防不及，不禁大吃一惊，使劲骂上两句后怒气冲冲地把球扔回他的薄皮手套里。春夏两季他一有钱就会去看地区棒球联盟的球赛，有时候别人会请他去看。看球的时候，他总会疯狂地为本区球队以及最棒的球员呐喊助威，脑海里时常幻想自己正在球场上大显身手，在胜负关头能够力挽狂澜。">查看中文翻译</div>
