<div class="line_en">They woke me at six in the morning. It seemed still the middle of the night to me, for my candle of course had burned to nothing, and the window-curtains were heavy and kept the thin light out. When the maid, Margaret, came knocking at my door, I thought I was in my old room at Lant Street. I was sure she was a thief, broke out from gaol and needing her fetters filed free by Mr Ibbs. That happened, sometimes; and sometimes the thieves were kind men, who knew us, and sometimes they were desperate villains. Once a man put a knife to Mr Ibbs's throat, because he said the file went too slow. So, hearing Margaret's knock now, I started from the bed, crying out, "Oh! Hold!" -- though what I meant to be held, and who ought to have done it, I could not tell you; and neither, I suppose, could Margaret. She put her face about the door, whispering, "Did you call, miss?" She had a jug of warm water for me, and she came and set my fire; then she reached beneath the bed and took the chamber-pot, and emptied it into her bucket of slops, and wiped it clean with a damp cloth that hung against her apron.</div>

<div class="line_en">Servants. She said I should take my breakfast in Mrs Stiles's pantry. Then she turned and left me -- getting a quick look, I thought, at my frock and my shoes and my open trunk, on the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些佣人们！她说我应该去斯特尔斯太太的餐室吃早饭。然后，她离开了，在离开的途中还不忘快速地扫视了一番—我想大概是在看我的鞋，我的上衣以及我开着的箱子吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the next-door room there came the murmur of voices. I heard Margaret saying, "Yes, miss." Then there was the shutting of a door. Then there was silence. I went down to my breakfast -- first losing my way among the dark passages at the bottom of the servants' stairs, and finding myself in the yard with the privy in it. The privy, I saw now, was surrounded by nettles, and the bricks in the yard broken up with weeds. The walls of the house had ivy on them, and some of the windows wanted panes. Gentleman was right, after all, about the place being hardly worth cracking. He was right, too, about the servants. When I found Mrs Stiles's pantry at last there was a man there, dressed in breeches and silk stockings, and with a wig on his head with powder on it. That was Mr Way. He had been steward to Mr Lilly for forty-five years, he said; and he looked it. When a girl brought the breakfasts, he was served first. We had gammon and an egg, and a cup of beer. They had beer with all their meals there, there was a whole room where it was brewed. And they say Londoners can lush!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔壁的房间传来低吟声。我听见玛格丽特说“是，小姐。”然后是关门声。之后是沉寂。我下楼吃早餐—在仆人专用楼梯下的黑暗的过道里迷路了，走到了那个有厕所的院子里。这个厕所周围长满了荨麻，野草穿过院子的墙壁顽强地滋生蔓延着。这幢房子四壁被爬墙虎所包围，有些窗子也是残破的。绅是对的，无论如何，这不是一个值得破门而入的地方。同样，他对那些佣人的描述也很准确。最后，当我找到斯泰尔斯太太的餐室时，有一个男人已经在哪儿了，穿着马裤和丝袜，头上戴着一定脏兮兮的假发。这就是威先生。据他自己说，他已经伺候李先生四十五年了，他喜欢这份工作。上早餐的时候，他是第一个被服务的对象。他吃的腌猪腿和一个鸡蛋，再加一杯啤酒。这儿的人吃饭总是喝啤酒，这儿有一整个屋子都是用来酿这玩意的。但是他们还说伦敦人奢侈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I waited for the fire to take, then rose and dressed. It was too cold to wash. My gown felt clammy. When I drew the window-curtain back and let the daylight in, I saw -- what I had not been able to see the night before, by the candle -- that the ceiling was streaked brown with damp, and the wood at the walls stained white.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在炉火完全燃起之后，我起来穿戴整齐。太冷了，以致连洗漱都成了一种折磨。我的睡袍感觉湿冷湿冷的。拉开窗帘，让阳光照进来，我看见—昨晚在烛光下无法看见的—由于潮湿，天花板上生成了一道道的褐色的痕迹，而墙壁上则是白色的霉点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had used to wash the chamber-pots, at home. Now, seeing Margaret tip my piddle into her bucket, I was not sure I liked it. But I said, Thank you, Margaret" -- then wished I hadn't; for she heard it and tossed her head, as if to say, Who did I think I was, thanking her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在家的时候，我也清洗过夜壶。现在，看着玛格丽特把我的尿液倒在她的桶里，我不确信自己喜欢这种感觉。但是我还是说，“谢谢你，玛格丽特。”——很快，我就后悔这样说了，因为她听到之后把头一甩，好像在说，你以为你是谁，也配谢谢我？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't know what to say to that. She went on, anyway: "Miss Maud rises early. She has asked that you be sent to her. Should you like to wash your hands before you go up? Miss Maud is like her uncle, and Particular."</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Way said hardly a word to me, but spoke to Mrs Stiles about the running of the house. He asked only after the family I was supposed to have just left; and when I told him, the Dunravens, of Whelk Street, Mayfair, he nodded and looked clever, saying he thought he knew their man.

<div class="line_en">She took me up. We went, as before, by the servant's stairs, but then struck out into a handsomer passage, that led to one or two doors. At one of these she knocked. I didn't catch the answer that came, but suppose she heard it. She straightened her back and turned the iron handle, and led me in.</div>

<div class="line_en">The room was a dark one, like all the rooms there. Its walls were panelled all over in an old black wood, and its floor -- which was bare, but for a couple of trifling Turkey carpets, that were here and there worn to the weave -- was also black. There were some great heavy tables about, and one or two hard sofas. There was a painting of a brown hill, and a vase full of dried leaves, and a dead snake in a glass case with a white egg in its mouth. The windows showed the grey sky and bare wet branches. The window-panes were small, and leaded, and rattled in their frames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和所有的屋子一样，这也是个黑暗的屋子。整墙都贴着黑色木头，地板秃秃的，除了铺着两条陈旧得都卷起了边的，并不起眼的土耳其地毯，同样，地板也是黑的。有几个笨重的桌子，一两个硬硬的沙发。一幅褐色山丘的画，一瓶已经凋零的花，以及一条死蛇搁在一玻璃瓶里，嘴里还含着一白色的蛋。窗外的景色是灰色天空和近乎干涸的河流。窗格很小，暗淡，在窗架里摇晃着，发出卡塔的响声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a little spluttering fire in a vast old grate, and before this -- standing gazing into the weak flames and the smoke, but turning as she heard my step, and starting, and blinking -- there was Miss Maud Lilly, the mistress of the house, that all our plot was built on.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had expected her, from all that Gentleman had said, to be quite out of the way handsome. But she was not that -- at least, I did not think her so as I studied her then, I thought her looks rather commonplace. She was taller than me by an inch or two -- which is to say, of an ordinary height, since I am considered short; and her hair was fairer than mine -- but not very fair -- and her eyes, which were brown, were lighter. Her lip and her cheek were very plump and smooth -- she did lick me there, I will admit, for I liked to bite my own lip, and my cheeks had freckles, and my features as a rule were said to be sharp. I was also thought young-looking; but as to that -- well, I should have liked the people who thought it to have studied Maud Lilly as she stood before me now. For if I was young, then she was an infant, she was a chick, she was a pigeon that knew nothing. She saw me come, and started, as I have said; and she took a step or two to meet me, and her pale cheek fired up crimson. Then she stopped, and put her hands before her, neatly, at her skirt. The skirt -- I had never seen such a thing before, on a girl her age -- the skirt was full and short and showed her ankles; and about her waist -- that was astonishingly narrow -- there was a sash. Her hair was caught in a net of velvet. On her feet were slippers, of red prunella. Her hands had clean white gloves upon them, buttoned up tight at the wrist. She said, "Miss Smith. You are Miss Smith, I think? And you have come to be my maid, from London! And may I call you Susan? I hope you shall like it at Briar, Susan; and I hope you shall like me. There is not much to like, in either case. I think you might do it very easily -- very easily, indeed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从绅的描述中，我设想她会很漂亮。但是其实不然。至少在我看来，她不是那么漂亮，只能说是相貌平平。她比我高一到两英寸—普通身高，因为我是算矮的；她的头发比我漂亮一些—但是也不能说非常漂亮—她的眼是褐色的，淡褐色。她的脸和唇丰满圆润—但我必须承认，她比我还是强点的，我喜欢咬自己的嘴唇，我的脸上还有雀斑，而且看起来太瘦了。我看起来很小，但是，关于这一点—现在站在我面前的李小姐实际是有过之而无不及。她看着我进来，上前一两步走到我的身边，她的脸被炉火映得通红。她停下，将手放在身前，贴着她的裙子。我以前从未看见过有像她这样的年纪女孩穿这样的裙子—宽而短，连膝盖都盖不住；她的腰细的惊人，上面缠一根腰带。她都上插着一朵紫罗兰。脚踏一双毛绒拖鞋。她双手白皙，带着直到手腕的白色手套。她说，“史密斯小姐。我想你就是史密斯小姐吧？就是你专程从伦敦赶来做我的女仆！我可以叫你苏珊么？我希望你喜欢布莱尔，苏珊；我同样也希望你能喜欢我。这应该不难，我想，实际上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You need not stay, Mrs Stiles," she said nicely. "But you will have been kind to Miss Smith, I know." She caught my eye. "You've heard, perhaps, that I am an orphan, Susan, like you. I came to Briar as a child: very young, and with no-one at all to care for me. I cannot tell you all the ways in which Mrs Stiles has made me know what a mother's love is, since that time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可以走了，斯特尔斯太太，”她非常和蔼地说道。“我知道你会对史密斯小姐好的。”她再次把目光投向我的眼睛。“你也许已经听说过，我是个孤儿，苏珊，和你一样。当我还是一个孩童的时候我来到布莱尔：那时我很小，没有人对我好。我不知该如何才能向你描述清楚，在那个时期里，斯特尔斯太太是如何让我体会到了母爱的含义。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smiled and tilted her head. Mrs Stiles would not catch her gaze, but a bit of colour struggled into her cheeks, and her eye-lids fluttered. I should never have put her down as the motherly sort, myself; but servants grow sentimental over the swells they work for, like dogs grow fond of bullies. You take my word for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她微笑着偏过头去。斯特尔斯太太没有和她对视，但是脸有些许犯红，眼皮跳动了几下。我想我永远也无法将她与什么慈爱的母亲联系在一起；但是仆人们对主子们肯定是不一样的，就像狗儿们喜欢欺负弱小同样道理。你就相信我说的吧！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She spoke in a soft, sweet, halting voice, tilting her head, hardly looking at me, still quite crimson at the cheek. I said, "I am sure I shall like you, miss."

<div class="line_cn" title="她的声音缓慢，甜美，温柔，在说话的时候，她微抬着头，看着我，脸颊依旧是红红的。我说，“我相信我会喜欢您的，小姐。”然后我想起了我在兰特街的练习课，抓住裙摆行了一个屈膝礼。当我再次直立起来，她微笑着，上前来握住了我的手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, she blinked and looked modest another minute; and then she left us. Maud smiled again, and led me to one of the hard-backed sofas, that was close to the fire. She sat beside me. She asked after my journey -- "We supposed you lost!" she said -- and after my room. Did I like my bed? Did I like my breakfast?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何，斯特尔斯太太在那一刻里眨了一下眼，看起来似乎很心虚地样子；然后她离开了。莫德小姐再次微笑，把我带到一个硬靠背的，靠近火炉的沙发那儿。我们并肩坐着。她问我关于我这一路的情况—“我们还以为你丢了呢！”她说，所处的位置正好在我房间的背后。然后她又问了是否喜欢我的床，对早餐是否满意等诸如此类的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And have you really," she said, "come from London?" That was all that anyone had been asking, since I left Lant Street -- as if I might have come from anywhere else! But then again, I thought she asked it in a different sort of way: not in a gaping country way, but in a noticing, hungryish manner -- as if London was something to her, and she longed to hear of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真的是从伦敦来的么？”她又问。自从我离开兰特街，所有人都问我这个问题—就好像我是骗人的一样！但是，这一次，她给我的感觉不一样：不是咄咄逼人，寻根问底，只是一种好奇而已—就好像伦敦对她来说有某种特殊意义，而非常渴望地听到关于伦敦的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next she told me all the duties I should have to do, while I was her maid: the chief of these being, as I also knew, to sit with her and keep her company, and walk with her about the park, and tidy her gowns. She lowered her eyes.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她看向地面，“你会发现我们这儿有自己的习惯和规矩。我想也许会有点麻烦，因为我们人手太少。我舅舅只喜欢看着我安安静静，整整齐齐。但是你，应该已经习惯伦敦的生活方式。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But what I said was, that Lady Alice -- who was the mistress that Gentleman had faked up for me -- was too kind to laugh at anyone, and would anyway know that grand clothes meant nothing, since it was the person inside the clothes that ought to be judged. All in all, I thought, it was a pretty clever thing to say; and she seemed to think so too, for when I had said it she looked at me in a new way and her colour went down, and she took my hand again, saying, "You are a good girl, Susan, I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我说的却是，爱丽丝女士—绅为我凭空捏造出来的所谓的女主人—非常的善良，不会嘲笑任何人，亦不会以貌取人。然后说莫德小姐看起来也是同样的人。我想，说这句话是明智的，因为听到这里，她用一种不同的眼光看着我，脸也不是那么红了，再次抓起我的手，说，“苏珊，你是个好女孩，我认为。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I remembered the character that Gentleman had written for me, and thought this might be the moment to present it. I took it from my pocket and handed it over. She rose and broke the wax, then walked to the window to hold the paper to the light. She stood a long time looking at the curling hand, and once sneaked a glance at me; and my heart beat a little fast then, to think she might have noticed something queer there. But it was not that: for I saw at last that her hand, which held the paper, trembled; and I guessed that she had no more idea what a proper character was like than I did, and was only figuring out what she should say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想起了绅为我伪造的推荐信，现在该是时候拿出来了。我从口袋里掏出递给她，她打开，拿到窗口光亮处。在那里，她呆站了很久，然后诡异地对着我一笑；我的心跳瞬时加快，以为她觉察到了什么不对劲的地方。其实不然：我注意到她握着那封信的手在颤抖；我猜想她只是为我的优秀人格所震惊，一时不知道说什么好了。">查看中文翻译</div>

I showed myself my tongue. Then I rubbed my hands and chuckled: for she was just as Gentleman had promised, and clearly tit over heels in love with him already; and that three thousand pounds might as well have been counted and wrapped and had my name put on it, and the doctor be standing ready with a strait-coat at the madhouse door.</div>

<div class="line_en">But I thought it in a discontented sort of way; and the chuckle, I have to admit, was rather forced. I could not have said quite why, though. I supposed it was the gloom -- for the house seemed darker and stiller than ever, now that she had gone. There was only the dropping of ash in the grate, the bumping and rattling of panes of glass. I went to the window. The draught was awful. There had been little red sand-bags laid upon the sills to keep it out, but they didn't work; and they had all got wet, and were mouldy. I put my hand to one, and my finger came away green. I stood and shivered, and looked at the view -- if you could call it a view, that was just plain grass and trees. A few black birds pulled worms from the lawn. I wondered which way London was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是想到这些，我并不是那么的开心；那咯咯的笑声，我必须承认，也不是发自内心的。虽然我也不是特别清楚这是为什么。我猜想，这是阴郁造成的——因为这房子在她走后似乎变成从未有过的黑暗和寂静。壁炉里只有燃尽的灰，窗格摇动着发出吱吱的响声。我走到窗边。冷气袭人。虽然窗台上放着沙袋试图阻挡它们，但是并不起什么作用；所有的沙袋都湿了并且发霉了。我将我的手放到其中一个上面，手指很快就变成了绿色。我站立着，同时颤抖着，看着窗外的景色——如果这还能被称作景色的话，只有单调的草和树木。几只黑色的鸟儿从草地上琢起虫子。我在想哪个方向是通向伦敦的呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I thought of something else. Put my rooms in order, Maud had said; and here was only one room, that I supposed must be her parlour; so somewhere else must be another, where she slept in her bed. Now, the walls in that house were all of dark oak panelling, very gloomy on the eye and very baffling, for the doors were set so pat in their frames, you could not spot them.

<div class="line_en">It was the door to her bedroom, just as I had supposed; and of course, this room had another door in it, that was the door to my own room, where I had stood the night before and listened for her breaths. That seemed a very foolish thing to have done, now that I saw what was on the other side of it. For it was only an ordinary lady's room -- not very grand, but grand enough, with a faint, sweet smell to it, and a high four-posted bed with curtains and a canopy of old moreen. I was not sure that sleeping in a bed like that wouldn't make me sneeze: I thought of all the dust and dead flies and spiders that must be gathered in the canopy, that looked as though it hadn't been taken down in ninety years. The bed had been made, but a night-dress lay upon it -- I folded this up and put it beneath the pillow; and there were one or two fair hairs there that I caught up and took to the grate. So much for maiding. Upon the chimney-breast there was a great aged looking-glass, shot through like marble, with silver and grey. Beyond it was a small old-fashioned press, that was carved all over with flowers and grapes, quite black with polish, and here and there split. I should say that ladies wore nothing but leaves in the day it was built, for it had six or seven slight gowns laid carelessly in it now, that made the shelves groan, and a crinoline cage, against which the doors could not be fastened. Seeing that, I thought again what a shame it was that Maud had no mother: for she would certainly have got rid of ancient stuff like this and found her daughter something more up to the minute and dainty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是通往她卧房的门，就像我原来猜测的；当然，这个房间还有另外一扇门，通向我的卧房，通向我昨晚偷听她呼吸声的地方。现在看来，那举动真的非常愚蠢，现在我已经看到了墙壁另一边的一切。只是一间普通的女士房间——不是特别宽敞，但也是足够宽敞了，弥漫着一种淡淡的香味，高高的四帐杆卧床，老式的遮篷。我不确信如果自己睡在这样一张床上是否会打喷嚏：我想那遮篷里一定有很多灰尘，死苍蝇和蜘蛛，因为它看起来至少有九十年没人动过了。床已经被稍稍整理过，不过上面还是散乱着一床被子——我把它折了起来放到枕头下面；有一两根落发，我拾起来扔到了壁炉里。女仆的工作真是琐碎阿。壁炉墙上是一面很棒的老式镜子，镶着灰色和银色的大理石。这旁边是一个老式的立式衣柜，雕刻着花和葡萄，黑漆漆的发亮。我敢说这位小姐从来没有用过这个衣柜，因为里面仅仅乱七八糟堆着六七件很薄的内衣，就已经让架子嘎吱作响了，还放着有一个装衬裙的篮子，这个篮子抵住了柜门，所以门只能虚掩着。看到这里，我再次为莫德没有母亲感到难过：否则她母亲肯定会让她扔了这些古董，而去买一些更时尚讲究的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But one thing a business like ours at Lant Street teaches you is, the proper handling of quality goods. I got hold of the gowns -- they were all as odd and short and girlish as each other -- and shook them out, then laid them nicely back on their shelf. Then I wedged a shoe against the crinoline to hold it flat; after that, the doors closed as they were meant to. This press was in one alcove. In another was a dressing-table. That was strewn about with brushes and bottles and pins -- I tidied those, too -- and fitted beneath with a set of fancy drawers. I opened them up. They held -- well, here was a thing. They all held gloves. More gloves than a milliner's. White ones, in the top drawer; black silk ones in the middle; and buff mittens in the lowest.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wood turned out to be lined with plush. The hinge was of silver, and oiled not to squeak. I am not sure what I thought to find in there -- perhaps, something from Gentleman, some keepsake, some letter, some little bill-andcoo. But what there was, was a miniature portrait, in a frame of gold hung on a faded ribbon, of a handsome, fair-haired lady. Her eyes were kind. She was dressed in a style from twenty years before, and the frame was an old one: she did not look much like Maud, but I thought it a pretty safe bet that she was her mother. -- Though I also thought that, if she was, then it was queer that Maud kept her picture locked up in a box, and did not wear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木盒挺顺利的打开了，里面衬有绒布。接口是银的，涂了油使它润滑。我不确定里面会放了什么—说不定是绅给她的东西，什么纪念品呀，情信呀，定情物啥的。但是打开一看，里面是一个袖珍人像，框在金像框里，还配了一条褪了色的绸带。那是一个漂亮的金发女郎。有一对慈爱的眼睛。她的打扮是20多年前的那种，像框也很老式了。她虽然长的不太像莫德，不过她应该是莫德的母亲。但是如果她是的话，莫德不把它带在身上而是锁在盒子里的做法倒是挺奇怪的。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Miss Maud isn't here," I said, when I saw the silver tea-pot; but the tea was for me. I drank it in fairysips, to make it last the longer. Then I took the tray back down, thinking to save the maid another journey. When they saw me carrying it into the kitchen, however, the girls there stared and the cook said, "Well, I never!

The twelve struck, and then the half, and I made my way to the back-stairs and hung about there until one of the parlourmaids went by, and she showed me the way to the library. It was a room on the first floor, that you reached from a gallery overlooking a great wood staircase and a hall; but it was all dark and dim and shabby, as it was everywhere in that house -- you would never have thought, looking about you there, that you were right in the home of a tremendous scholar. By the door to the library, on a wooden shield, hung some creature's head with one glass eye: I stood and put my fingers to its little white teeth, waiting to hear the clock sound one.

<div class="line_en">I saw Maud first: she was sitting at a desk with a book before her, her hands upon the covers. Her hands were bare, she had her little white gloves laid neatly by, but she sat beside a shaded lamp, that threw all its light upon her fingers, and they seemed pale as ashes upon the page of print. Above her was a window. Its glass had yellow paint upon it. All about her, over all the walls of the room, were shelves; and the shelves had books on -- you never saw so many. A stunning amount. How many stories does one man need? I looked at them and shuddered. Maud rose, closing the book that was before her. She took up the white gloves and drew them back on.</div>

I thought her only pretty lonely, and pretty bookish and bored -- as who wouldn't be, in a house like that? When we had finished our lunch she went to the window: the sky was grey and threatening rain, but she said she had a fancy to go out walking. She said, "Now, what shall I wear for it?", and we stood at the door of her little black press, looking over her coats, her bonnets and her boots. That killed nearly an hour.

At the edge of the wood was a little stone windowless building Maud said was an ice-house. "Let us just cross to the door and look inside," she would say, and she'd stand and gaze at the cloudy blocks of ice until she shivered. At the back of the ice-house there started a muddy lane, that led you to a shut-up old red chapel surrounded by yews. This was the queerest, quietest place I ever saw. I never heard a bird sing there. I didn't like to go to it, but Maud took that way often. For at the chapel there were graves, of all the Lillys that had come before her; and one of these was a plain stone tomb, that was the grave of her mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is a melancholy place," she said. "Let's walk a little further."</div>

<div class="line_en">I wondered how Maud would look, if she knew what bad blood flowed in me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想知道，如果莫德知道我身上流淌着这样的坏人的血液，会怎么想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she never thought to ask. She only sat, gazing hard at her mother's name, while I wandered and stamped my feet. Then at last she sighed and looked about her, passed her hand across her eyes, and drew up her hood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她永远不会想到去问。在我跺着脚走来走去的时候，她只是呆坐着，瞪着她母亲的名字。最后她叹了口气，左右看了一下，用手揉了揉眼睛，拉下面纱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She led me away from the circle of yews, back down the lane between the hedges, then away from the wood and the ice-house, to the edge of the park. Here, if you followed a path that ran alongside a wall, you reached a gate. She had a key for it. It took you to the bank of a river. You could not see the river from the house. There was an ancient landing-place there, half rotted away, and a little upturned punt that made a kind of seat. The river was narrow, its water very quiet and muddy and filled with darting fish. All along the bank there grew rushes. They grew thick and high. Maud walked slowly beside them, gazing nervously into the darkness they made where they met the water. I supposed she was frightened of snakes. Then she plucked up a reed and broke it, and sat with the tip of it pressed against her plump mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她带着我离开了紫杉林，回到篱笆间的小路，然后离开树林和冰屋，来到了公园的边缘处。这在里，如果你沿着墙边的小路走，你会到达一扇大门。她有钥匙。这门通向河边。在那房子里你是看不到这河的。那儿有一个一半已经腐烂掉的废弃的码头，一条底朝天的小船，可以当作椅子。这条河很窄，安静泥泞，里面有很多鱼儿。两岸是浓密的高大灌木，莫德在其间慢慢地走着，凝视着它们在河水上投下的倒影。我猜她不想在绕弯子了。她折下一根芦苇，掰成两段，将尖梢含在唇间，坐下了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pretty stretch of water," I said, for politeness' sake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“水边，多美，”处于礼貌，我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded. I didn't then know -- for, who would have guessed it? -- that that trifling bit of water was the Thames. I thought she meant the boat would join a bigger river further on. Still, the idea that it would reach the city -- maybe sail under London Bridge -- made me sigh. I turned to watch it follow a bend in the water; then it passed from sight. The sound of its engine faded, the smoke from its chimney joined the grey of the sky and was lost. The air was thin again. Maud still sat with the tip of the broken reed against her lip, her gaze very vague. I took up stones and began to throw them into the water. She watched me do it, winking at every splash. Then she led me back up to the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她点点头。我不知道——谁能想的到呢？——这条小河是泰晤士河的一段。我猜她是指那船会到前面转进某条大河里。同样，所谓到达伦敦——也许指的是经过伦敦桥下吧——让我叹息。我转过身，看着它随着水面起伏，然后消失在视野里。它的马达声渐渐远去，从它烟囱里飘出的烟与天空融为一体。空气再次变得稀薄。莫德依旧含着那段芦苇尖坐着，双眼充满了迷茫。我开始捡石头打水漂。她看着我，每一次的水花溅起都令她的眼里闪烁出某种光芒。然后她带我回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sat beside her. The day was windless, but cold, and so quiet it hurt the ears. The air smelled thin.</div>

<div class="line_en">We went back to her room. She got out a bit of sewing -- a colourless, shapeless thing, I don't know if it was meant to be a tablecloth, or what. I never saw her working on anything else. She sewed in her gloves, very badly -- making crooked stitches and then ripping half of them out. It made me nervous. We sat together before the spluttering fire, and talked in a weak kind of way -- I forget what of -- and then it grew dark, and a maid brought lights; and then the wind picked up and the windows began to rattle worse than ever. I said to myself, "Dear God, let Gentleman come soon! I think a week of this will kill me"; and I yawned. Maud caught my eye. Then she also yawned. That made me yawn harder. At last she put her work aside and tucked up her feet and laid her head upon the arm of the sofa, and seemed to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们回到她的房间。她拿出一块布——没有色彩，没有形状，我猜想是不是抹布什么的。我从没有看见过她干过其它的。她把这缝进自己的手套——非常糟糕——走针走的歪歪扭扭的，还有一半露出来了。这让我紧张。我们在闪耀着的炉火前坐下，然后随意的说了点什么——我忘了具体说了什么了——然后天就黑了，一个女佣拿来了蜡烛；接着起风了，窗子咯咯响的厉害，从未有过的厉害。我对自己说，“上帝啊，让绅早点来吧！”再这样过一个星期我就活不下去了“；我打了个呵欠。莫德看着我的眼睛，也打了个呵欠。这让我的呵欠打得更厉害了。最后她把她的针线活儿放在一旁，蜷着腿，头看着沙发的扶手上，好像是睡着了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was two hours with him. I saw nothing of that of course, but took my dinner in the kitchen, with the servants. They told me that, when he had eaten, Mr Lilly liked his niece to sit and read to him in the drawing-room. That was his idea of fun, I suppose, for they said he hardly ever had guests, and if he did then they were always other bookish gentlemen, from Oxford and London; and it was his pleasure, then, to have Maud read books to them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一起度过了两个小时。当然，我没看到，我和佣人们一起在厨房里吃晚饭。他们告诉我，李先生喜欢在吃饭的时候，听他的外甥女在画室里为他朗读。我猜这就是他的乐趣，因为他们告诉我，李先生几乎没有客人，即使有，也都是从牛津或者伦敦来的书虫；那时，让莫德为大家读书就是他的乐趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That's all there was to do there, until the clock struck seven. When she heard that she gave a bigger yawn than ever, put her fingers to her eyes, and rose. Seven o'clock was when she must change her dress again -- and change her gloves, for ones of silk -- to have supper with her uncle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是这儿在7点之前的所有生活。当七点的钟声传来，她打了个大呵欠，揉了揉眼，起来了。七点是她再次换衣服的时间——同时换上丝质手套——以和她舅舅共进晚餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the parlourmaid fell silent. I sat and thought about Mr Lilly, with his red cap and his gold repeater, his green eye-glasses, his black finger and tongue; and then about Maud, frowning over her eggs, rubbing hard at her mother's grave. It seemed a queer kind of prizing, that would make a girl like her, like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个女侍不作声了。我坐在那里，想着李先生，想着他红色的帽子，金色的打簧表，绿色的眼镜，黑色的手指和舌头；然后又想到李小姐，对着鸡蛋皱眉，在她母亲的墓前使劲搓着手。这是一种古怪的珍爱，让她变成了这个样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Above his voice came the faint sound of laughter and scraping chairs, that was Cook and the scullery-maids and William Inker and the knife-boy, enjoying themselves in the kitchen.</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought I knew all about her. Of course, I knew nothing. I had my dinner, listening to the servants talk, not saying much; and then Mrs Stiles asked me, Should I like to come and take my pudding with her and Mr Way, in her own pantry? I supposed I ought to. I sat gazing at the picture made all of hair. Mr Way read us pieces from the Maidenhead paper, and at every story -- that were all about bulls breaking fences, or parsons making interesting sermons in church -- Mrs Stiles shook her head, saying, "Well, did you ever hear the like?" and Mr Way would chuckle and say, "You'll see, Miss Smith, that we are quite a match for London, news-wise!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想我完全了解她。其实，我什么也不知道。我吃着晚餐，听着其它佣人谈话，没有说太多。然后斯泰尔斯太太问我愿意和威先生以及她一起到她的餐室去拿点布丁么？我想我应该去。我坐在那儿盯着那些用头发做成的画儿。威先生给我们读了一张梅登海德的报纸，每说一个故事——什么公牛冲破篱笆阿，牧师在教堂里说的小笑话阿——斯泰尔斯太太都会摇头晃脑，说，“哇，你以前听过这种事么？”威先生就会咯咯地笑，说，“史密斯小姐，你会发现，我们和伦敦一点也不落伍呢，消息灵通！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I almost lost my way again, on my way back up; but even so, when she saw me she said, "Is that you, Susan? You are quicker than Agnes." She smiled. "I think you are handsomer, too. I don't think a girl can be handsome -- do you? -- with red hair. But nor with fair hair, either. I should like to be dark, Susan!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在回去的路上，我差点又迷路了；即使这样，当她看见我的时候，说。“是你么，苏珊？你比阿格里斯快。”她继续微笑着。“而且也漂亮些。我不认为一个红头发的女孩，或是浅色头发的女孩会漂亮，你说是么？我希望有一头黑发，苏珊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the great house clock struck, and immediately after it the servants' bell sounded; and that meant that Mr Lilly was ready to be seen by Mr Way into his bed, and that Maud was ready to be put by me into hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后钟声再次传来，紧接着是仆人的铃声，这意味着威先生要伺候李先生睡觉了，而我也要伺候莫德睡觉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she moved away from the fire, for me to put her into her nightgown. It was not much like undressing the chair in our old kitchen, after all. She stood shivering, saying, "Quick! I shall freeze! Oh, heavens!" -- for her bedroom was as draughty as everywhere else there, and my fingers were cold and made her jump. They grew warm, though, after a minute. Stripping a lady is heavy work. Her corset was long, with a busk of steel; her waist, as I think I have said, was narrow: the kind of waist the doctors speak against, that gives a girl an illness. Her crinoline was made of watchspring. Her hair, inside its net, was fixed with half a pound of pins, and a comb of silver. Her petticoats and shimmy were calico. Underneath it all, however, she was soft and smooth as butter. Too soft, I thought her. I imagined her bruising. She was like a lobster without its shell. She stood in her stockings while I fetched her nightgown, her arms above her head, her eyes shut tight; and for a second I turned, and looked at her. My gaze was nothing to her. I saw her bosom, her bottom, her feather and everything and -- apart from the feather, which was brown as a duck's -- she was as pale as a statue on a pillar in a park. So pale she was, she seemed to shine. But again, it was a troubling kind of paleness, and I was glad to cover her up. I tidied her gown back into the press and jammed closed the door. She sat and waited, yawning, for me to come and brush her hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她走开了，让我为她穿上睡衣。这和为咱们老厨房里的凳子脱衣服可真有点不一样。她坐在那儿，因为寒冷而发抖，说道，“快！我要冻僵了！天！”——她的卧房处处漏风，我的手指又冰凉，让她几乎跳了起来。过了一会，我的手暖和了起来。给一位女士脱衣可是重活。她的束胸衣很长，带钢圈的；她的腰，就像我说过的，很细；医生会说太细了，这女孩生病了。她的裙子上有挂表的地方。她的头发里大概有半磅重的卡子，还有一把银梳子。衬裙和内衣是白棉布的，除去一切，她的皮肤光洁如脂。我觉得，太柔软了。我想象着她大概很容易被擦伤吧。现在她看起来就像剥去了壳的虾。当我为她取内衣的时候，她穿着长袜坐着。双手举过头，双眼紧闭。很快我就回来了，看着她。她一点也不介意这样被我看着。我看到了她的胸，她的臀，她的feather，一切的一切，除去那如鸭毛般深褐色的feather，她苍白的就像公园里柱子上的雕像。如此苍白，仿佛要发光似的。这不是什么好的苍白，我很高兴能把她遮盖起来。我把她的袍子放回到柜子里。她坐着那儿，打着呵欠等待着我为她打理头发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had had wine with her supper, and I had had beer. I should say we were both, in our own ways, rather tipsy. She had me stand beside her at the great silvery glass above her fireplace, and drew my head to hers, to compare the colours of our hair. "Yours is the darker," she said.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没有了，苏珊，”她回答道。她把脸移到枕头上。她不喜欢头发扎在脖子里：她把它们拨到后面，滑进黑暗里，如绳索一般又黑又直，而且很细。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She reached and put her fingers quickly upon mine, as she said this; and I rather shuddered to feel the kid-skin on them -- for she had changed out of her silk gloves, only to button another white pair back on.

<div class="line_en">When I took my candle off, the shadow spread across her like a wave. Her room was dimly lit by the lamp, but her bed was in darkness. I half-closed my door, and heard her lift her head. "A little wider," she called softly, so I opened it further. Then I stood and rubbed my face. I had been at Briar only a day; but it was the longest day of my life. My hands were sore from pulling laces. When I closed my eyes, I saw hooks. Undressing myself had no fun in it, now I had undressed her.</div>

I am softer than you or your uncle know"; and I made my way to the crack of the door and peeped through. She had leaned out of the curtained bed, and had the portrait of the handsome lady -- her mother -- in her hand. As I watched, she raised the portrait to her mouth, kissed it, and spoke soft, sad words to it. Then she put it from her with a sigh. She kept the key in a book beside her bed. I hadn't thought to look in there. She locked the box back up, set it neatly on the table -- touched it once, touched it twice -- and then moved back behind the curtain and was still.</div>

<div class="line_en">I cannot say how long I slept for then. I could not say, when I woke up, what awful sound it was that had woken me. I did not know, for a minute or two, whether my eyes were open or closed -- for the darkness was so deep, there was no difference -- it was only when I gazed at the open door to Maud's room and saw the faint light there, that I knew I was awake and not dreaming. What I had heard, I thought, was some great crash or thud, and then perhaps a cry. Now, in the instant of my opening my eyes, there was a silence; but as I lifted my head and felt my heart beat hard, the cry came again. It was Maud, calling out in a high, frightened voice. She was calling on her old maid: "Agnes! Oh! Oh! Agnes!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The room beyond was very dark. The few great bits of furniture sat humped about, like the baskets with the thieves in, in the play of Ali Baba. I thought now dismal it would be if I had come all the way to Briar, from the Borough, to be murdered by burglars. And what if the burglar proved to be a man I knew -- say, one of Mr Ibbs's nephews? Queer things like that do happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客厅里非常黑。影影绰绰矗立着几件大家具，感觉好象《阿里巴巴和四十大盗》里藏贼的箱子。我想到，如果我千方百计地从镇子上赶到布莱尔，结果到这里却被强盗杀害了，那光景该有多凄凉！如果最后证实，这个强盗竟是我认识的——比如，艾伯斯先生的一个外甥？！不是说怕什么来什么嘛！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I stood gazing fearfully at the dark room, thinking all this, half-inclined to call out -- in case there were burglars there -- that they should hold their hands, that I was family; but of course, there was no-one, it was quiet as a church. I saw that, and then went quickly to the parlour door, and looked into the passage; and that was dark and quiet, too -- there was only the ticking of some clock, faroff, and more rattling windows. But after all it was not quite pleasant, standing in a night-dress, with a rush-light, in a great dark silent house that, though it didn't have thieves in, might certainly have ghosts. I closed the door quick, and went back to Maud's room and closed that door, and stepped to the side of her bed and put the light down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以我站住，瞪着这个黑漆漆的房间，心里胡思乱想着，斜着身子探进去——万一屋里真有个强盗——他们应该紧攥着拳头吧，而我是他们的目标；屋子里当然没有人，静得象教堂。我快步走到客厅门口，开门看看走廊，走廊里也是黑暗而寂静，只有远处钟表的滴答声和窗玻璃的喀哒声。不过总而言之，这还是让人不太舒服，穿睡衣站在那儿，提盏汽灯，在这么一座又大在又黑的房子里，即便没有强盗进来，也可能有幽灵啊。我赶紧关上门，回到莫德的房间，走到她床边放下灯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was about to answer, but then I stopped. For I had looked towards the corner of the room, where the black press was; and there was something strange there. There was something long and white and gleaming, that was moving against the wood… Well, I have said, haven't I, that I've a warm imagination? I was certain that the thing was Maud's dead mother, come back as a ghost to haunt me. My heart leapt so hard into my mouth, I seemed to taste it. I screamed, and Maud screamed, then clutched at me and wept harder. "Don't look at me!" she cried. And then: "Don't leave me! Don't leave me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正要回答时，我忽然停住。因为我看到墙角黑衣柜那边，有什么东西不对。那边有个又长又白的东西，还泛着光，在那里磕着木板…噢，我说过，我有着丰富的想象力，我说过吗？我想那东西是莫德死去的妈妈。我心跳加剧，快蹦到嘴里了，我好象都尝到它的滋味了。我尖叫起来，莫德也尖叫，她抓住我，哭的更凶了。“不要看我！”她哭道。接着：“别丢下我！别丢下我！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For it was only the cage of her crinoline, sprung out from where I had jammed it on the shelf with one of her shoes. The door of the press had swung open and hit the wall: that was the noise that had woken us. The crinoline was hanging from a hook, and quivering. My footsteps had made the springs bounce. I saw it, as I say, and almost laughed; but when I looked again at Maud, her eyes were still so black and wild and her face so pale, and she clutched at me so hard, I thought it would be cruel to let her see me smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是她的裙衬，我本来用她的一只鞋压在上面，现在它弹起来，衣柜门被弹开了，敲打着墙——这就是吵醒我们的那个声音，裙衬挂在一个挂钩上，摇摆着，就是我脚踩过的那个裙衬。看到这，正如我所说，我几乎要哈哈大笑了；不过等我又看到莫德，她漆黑惊恐的眼睛，惨白的面色，抓我抓得那么用力，我觉得让她看到我笑，这对她太残忍了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So I put her from me, but only for a moment; and I clambered over her and got beneath the blankets at her side. I put my arm about her, and at once she sank against me. It seemed the least that I could do. I pulled her closer. She was slender as anything. Not like Mrs Sucksby. Not like Mrs Sucksby, at all. She was more like a child. She still shivered a little, and when she blinked I felt the sweep of her lashes against my throat, like feathers. In time, however, the shivering stopped, and her lashes swept again and then were still. She grew heavy, and warm.</div>

It was all just the first day, over again.
