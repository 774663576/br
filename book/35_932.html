<div class="line_en">The goat, Axl could see, was well at home on this mountain terrain. It was eating happily the stubbly grass and heather, not caring about the wind, or that its left legs were poised so much lower than the right. The animal had a fierce tug -- as Axl had discovered all too well during their ascent -- and it had not been easy to find a way of safely tethering it while he and Beatrice took their rest. But he had spotted a dead tree root protruding from the slope, and had carefully bound the rope to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索能看出来，那只山羊在这山里过得悠闲自在。山风很大，而且羊的左边两条腿位置高，右边两条腿位置低，但它统统不理会，正开心地啃着草皮和石楠。这羊力气很大——上山的时候，埃克索已经领教了——他和比特丽丝需要休息，要找个地方把羊拴牢，也很不容易。最后他发现了一个死树根，从山坡的地面上突出来，于是把绳子仔细拴在树根上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The goat was clearly visible from where they now sat. The two large rocks, leaning one towards the other like an old married couple, had been visible from some way down, but Axl had hoped to come across a shelter from the wind long before they reached them. Yet the bare hillside had offered nothing, and they had had to persevere up the little path, the goat tugging as impulsively as the fierce gusts. But when at last they reached the twin rocks, it was as if God had crafted for them this sanctuary, for while they could still hear the blasts around them, they felt only faint stirrings in the air. Even so, they sat close against one another, as if in imitation of the stones above them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从他们现在坐的地方，能清楚地看到山羊。那两块大岩石相互依靠着，像一对老夫妻，他们还没爬上来的时候就已经看到了，不过埃克索并不想到岩石那儿休息，他希望能提前找个地方避避风。山坡上光秃秃的，什么也没有，他们只好继续坚持，沿着窄窄的山路往上爬，山风猛烈，那头羊也和山风一样任性。等他们最后来到这两块岩石旁，才发现这似乎是上帝为他们准备好的避难所，周围大风呼号，他们却只感觉到空气微微拂动。不过，两人还是紧紧依偎着，好像是害怕头顶的岩石一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The goat had been eating with equal appetite earlier that morning when they had first come upon the little stone cottage. The cottage had been easy to miss, hidden within a pocket of shadow at the foot of a looming cliff, and even when Beatrice had pointed it out to him, Axl had mistaken it for the entrance to a settlement not unlike their own, dug deep into the mountainside. Only as they had come closer had he realised it was an isolated structure, the walls and roof alike built from shards of dark grey rock. Water was falling from high above in a fine thread just in front of the cliffside, to collect in a pool not far from the cottage and trickle away where the land dipped out of view. A little way before the cottage, just now brightly illuminated by the morning sun, was a small fenced paddock, the sole occupant of which was the goat. As usual the animal had been eating busily, but broke off to stare in astonishment at Axl and Beatrice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之前他们初次看到那个石头小屋的时候，那只山羊也和现在一样，正心满意足地啃着草。小屋隐藏在一道隐隐耸现的山崖脚下的阴暗处，很容易错过，比特丽丝指给埃克索看，埃克索还以为那是个入口，里面是居住区，和家乡的房子差不多，是山腰上挖出来的。他们走近之后，才发现那是个独立的房子，墙和屋顶都是一块块的深灰色岩石。水从高处淌下来，像一条细线，落在崖壁前，聚在离石屋不远的一个池子里，然后顺着坡地流走。石屋前方不远处，有一个很小的牧场，用篱笆围着，被初升的太阳照得明晃晃的，整个牧场里只有一只山羊。它和往常一样正忙着吃草，看到埃克索和比特丽丝，惊讶地瞪大眼睛看着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm still as anxious for it, Axl. For wouldn't it be a fine thing if Querig were slain and this mist no more? It's just when I see that goat chewing the earth that way, it's hard to believe a foolish creature like that could ever do away with a great she-dragon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我现在还很焦急，埃克索。杀掉魁瑞格，这迷雾就没了，难道不是好事吗？只不过刚才我看着山羊那样悠闲地啃草皮，很难相信这样一个傻家伙，竟然能够对付巨大的母龙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And now she had said what she had. A picture came into his mind, clear and vivid, of himself and Beatrice on a mountain road, large grey skies above them, she walking several steps before him, and a great melancholy welled up within him.

The sun, now shining almost directly into it, should have made it easier to discern what was before him, but instead created confusing shadows, and where there was puddle and ice, a myriad of dazzling surfaces. The goat appeared to have been of monstrous proportions, and now lay in several dismembered pieces. Over there, a hind leg; there the neck and head -- the latter wearing a serene expression. It took a little longer to identify the soft upturned belly of the animal, because pressed into it was a giant hand emerging from the dark mud. Only then did he see that much of what initially he had taken to be of the dead goat belonged to a second creature entangled with it. That mound there was a shoulder; that a stiffened knee. Then he saw movement and realised the thing in the ditch was still alive.</div>

He did not look back until they had passed the goat's pen, and then he saw the children still standing there, three abreast, watching silently, the towering cliffs behind them. Axl waved encouragingly, but something like shame -- and perhaps the trace of some distant memory, a memory of another such departure -- made him increase his pace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索拉着妻子的胳膊，转身离开孩子们。两人经过山羊圈的时候，他才回头看，孩子们仍旧站在那儿，三人排成一排，默默地看着，身后就是直插云霄的崖壁。埃克索挥挥手表示鼓励，但他心里感到有些羞愧——也许还有遥远记忆的痕迹，一次类似的告别——于是加快了脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dear child," Axl said, "our hearts go out to you, and we'll raise help at the next village. But we're too weak to do what you ask, and surely others will pass this way soon, happy to take the goat for you. It's beyond us old ones, but we'll pray for your parents' return and that God will keep you safe always."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的孩子啊，”埃克索说，“我们心里都向着你，到下一个村庄，我们就请人帮忙。但是我们太虚弱了，你让我们做的事情，我们做不了，肯定还会有人从这儿经过，愿意帮你把羊牵过去。我们这些老人可不行，但我们会祈祷你们父母归来，祈祷上帝保佑，让你们永远平安无事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不要回头看他们，公主，那样只会勾起他们的希望。我们不能回去，也不去牵羊，我们要往下走，到这个山谷里，烤烤火，吃点好心的陌生人给的食物。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But before they had gone far -- the marshy ground had started to descend and the valleys to open before them -- Beatrice tugged his arm to slow them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I didn't wish to talk across you before those children, husband," she said. "But is it really beyond us to do as they ask?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"But think on what it is they ask, Axl." Beatrice had now brought them to a halt. "Will a chance like this ever come our way again? Think on it! We stumble to this spot so near Querig's lair. And these children offer a poisonous goat by which even the two of us, old and weak though we are, might bring down the she-dragon! Think on it, Axl! If Querig falls, the mist will fast begin to clear. Who's to say those children aren't right and God himself didn't bring us this way?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，埃克索，想想他们的请求吧。”比特丽丝这时让两人停下了脚步。“我们还有可能碰上这样的机会吗？想一想！我们碰巧到了这个地方，离魁瑞格的巢穴这么近。那些孩子又有一头有毒的山羊，虽然我们又老又弱，但有了山羊，说不定我们两个人就能杀死母龙呢！想一想吧，埃克索！如果魁瑞格死了，迷雾很快就会散掉。也许那些孩子说得对，也许真的是上帝把我们领到了这儿，谁知道呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My pain's no worse. Axl, look how those children stand as we left them, watching as we grow ever smaller in their sight. Can't we at least pause beside this stone and talk further on it? Let's not hasten away carelessly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我身上的痛没有加重。埃克索，看看那些孩子，我们走了，他们还一直看着，我们在他们眼里都变成小点了吧。我们至少可以在这块石头这儿歇一下，再谈谈这件事吧？我们不要不加考虑就急忙离开。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're not to face her, Axl, only to tether the goat and flee. It may be days before Querig comes to the spot, and we'll by then be safe at our son's village. Axl, don't we want returned to us our memories of this long life lived together? Or will we become like strangers met one night in a shelter? Come, husband, say we'll turn back and do as those children bid us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不用去面对她，埃克索，只要拴好山羊，然后快点走。魁瑞格可能要过好几天才会到那个地方，到那时候，我们已经安全地到了儿子的村庄啦。埃克索，我俩在一起这么久的记忆，难道我们都不想要回来吗？难道我们要变得像某个晚上一起遮风避雨的陌生人？来吧，丈夫，你点个头吧，我们回去，照孩子们的请求做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Axl remained silent for a moment, fighting the urge to look back towards the stone cottage. "There's no telling that goat will bring any harm at all to Querig," he said eventually. "A hapless ogre's one thing. This she-dragon's a creature to scatter an army. And can it be wise for two elderly fools like us to wander so near her lair?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索又沉默了一会儿，努力克制回头看那座石屋的冲动。“山羊能不能伤害到魁瑞格，还很难说呢，”他开口说道。“一头倒霉的食人兽是一回事。这头母龙，可是个连军队都能打散的家伙。我们这样一对老傻瓜，晃到离她巢穴那么近的地方，恐怕不明智吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So here they were, climbing still higher, the winds growing stronger. For the moment, the twin rocks provided good shelter, but they could not stay like this for ever. Axl wondered yet again if he had been foolish to give in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，他们到了这儿，越爬越高，山风也越来越大。两块岩石能临时遮挡一下，可他们不能一直待在这儿。埃克索又开始怀疑，自己让了步，答应做这件事，也许是个愚蠢的决定。">查看中文翻译</div>
