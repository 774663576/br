<div class="line_en">It wasn't so much the whistling itself, Laila thought later, but the seconds between the start of it and impact. The brief and interminable time of feeling suspended. The not knowing. The waiting. Like a defendant about to hear the verdict.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's the whistling," Laila said to Tariq, "the damn whistling, I hate more than anything."</div>

<div class="line_en">But the flip side of being spared was the agony of wondering who hadn't. After every rocket blast, Laila raced to the street, stammering a prayer, certain that, this time, surely this time, it was Tariq they would find buried beneath the rubble and smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但幸免遭难也带来了担心到底是谁死于非命的烦恼。每一枚火箭弹爆炸之后，莱拉总会冲上街道，磕磕巴巴地做祷告，而且确凿无疑地相信，这一次，肯定是这一次，人们将会发现埋在废墟和烟雾之下的正是塔里克。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Often it happened at dinner, when she and Babi were at the table. When it started, their heads snapped up. They listened to the whistling, forks in midair, unchewed food in their mouths. Laila saw the reflection of their half-lit faces in the pitch-black window, their shadows unmoving on the wall. The whistling. Then the blast, blissfully elsewhere, followed by an expulsion of breath and the knowledge that they had been spared for now while somewhere else, amid cries and choking clouds of smoke, there was a scrambling, a bare-handed frenzy of digging, of pulling from the debris, what remained of a sister, a brother, a grandchild.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她和爸爸坐在餐桌上吃晚饭时，经常能够听到呼啸声。每当它响起，他们的脑袋就会猛地抬起。他们会听着呼啸声，刀叉停在半空，嘴里尽是未咀嚼的食物。莱拉看到黝黑的玻璃窗映照出他们被照亮的脸庞，他们的影子在墙壁上移动。呼啸声。接着是爆炸声，幸好是从别的地方传来的，然后他们会松一口气，明白他们暂时逃过一劫，但在某个地方，在一片哭喊声和呛人的烟雾之中，有人正在挣扎地爬出来，疯狂地用双手去扒一堆废墟，从里面将他们的姐妹、兄弟或者孙子拉出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At night, Laila lay in bed and watched the sudden white flashes reflected in her window. She listened to the rattling of automatic gunfire and counted the rockets whining overhead as the house shook and flakes of plaster rained down on her from the ceiling. Some nights, when the light of rocket fire was so bright a person could read a book by it, sleep never came. And, if it did, Laila's dreams were suffused with fire and detached limbs and the moaning of the wounded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当到了晚上，莱拉就会躺在床上，看着她的窗户反射出的几道突然亮起的白光。屋子摇摇晃晃，几片石灰从她房间的天花板掉下来，而她静静地倾听冲锋枪开火的嗒嗒声，数着有多少枚火箭弹划过上方的天空。有时候，火箭弹喷射出的火焰很亮，人们甚至可以借着它的光线看书；在这样的夜晚，莱拉便会彻夜难眠。而在莱拉能入睡的夜晚，她又总是梦到炮火、和身体分离的手或脚，还有不断呻吟的伤者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morning brought no relief. The muezzin's call for namaz rang out, and the Mujahideen set down their guns, faced west, and prayed. Then the rugs were folded, the guns loaded, and the mountains fired on Kabul, and Kabul fired back at the mountains, as Laila and the rest of the city watched as helpless as old Santiago watching the sharks take bites out of his prize fish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天亮了也不意味着能够松一口气。宣布祷告开始的钟声响起，圣战组织的人会放下武器，面朝西方，做起祷告。然后他们会收起跪拜用的地毯，重新装上弹药，炮火从群山射向喀布尔，喀布尔也朝群山发射炮弹；莱拉和城里其他人只能无助地看着这一切，就像老迈的圣地亚哥看着鲨鱼将他那条宝贵的鱼撕成碎片一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">EVERYWHERE LAILA WENT, she saw Massoud's men. She saw them roam the streets and every few hundred yards stop cars for questioning. They sat and smoked atop tanks, dressed in their fatigues and ubiquitous pakols. They peeked at passersby from behind stacked sandbags at intersections.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论莱拉走到哪里，她总能看见马苏德的人。她看到他们在马路上巡逻，每隔几百米就拦住一些轿车进行盘问。他们坐在坦克上面吸烟，穿着迷彩服，戴着那顶无处不见的毡帽。他们在交叉路口叠起沙包，躲在后面观察过往的行人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，他说：“我买了一把枪。”他们坐在屋外，就在莱拉的院子中那棵梨树之下的地面上。他把枪拿出来给她看。他说这是贝瑞塔手枪，半自动的。在莱拉看来，它只不过是一把黑色的杀人武器罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was her lifeline to the streets now. He heard the word of mouth and passed it on to her. Tariq was the one who told her, for instance, that militiamen stationed in the mountains sharpened their marksmanship -- and settled wagers over said marksmanship -- by shooting civilians down below, men, women, children, chosen at random. He told her that they fired rockets at cars but, for some reason, left taxis alone -- which explained to Laila the recent rash of people spraying their cars yellow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他成了她和外界联系的救生索。他听到人们说的话，然后再告诉她。例如，正是塔里克让她知道，驻扎在山上的士兵以向山下的市民开枪来练枪法，以是否打中为胜负标准下赌注，至于靶子是男人、女人还是小孩，则由他们随机挑选。他还告诉她，说这些人朝轿车发射火箭弹，但不知道为了什么原因，却从不射击出租车——莱拉这才明白最近有很多人把他们的轿车喷成黄色的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tariq explained to her the treacherous, shifting boundaries within Kabul. Laila learned from him, for instance, that this road, up to the second acacia tree on the left, belonged to one warlord; that the next four blocks, ending with the bakery shop next to the demolished pharmacy, was another warlord's sector; and that if she crossed that street and walked half a mile west, she would find herself in the territory of yet another warlord and, therefore, fair game for sniper fire. And this was what Mammy's heroes were called now. Warlords. Laila heard them called tofangdar too. Riflemen. Others still called them Mujahideen, but, when they did, they made a face -- a sneering, distasteful face -- the word reeking of deep aversion and deep scorn. Like an insult.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔里克把喀布尔城里各处变化莫测的危险地带说给她听。例如，她从他那儿得知，这条路直到左边第二棵金合欢树的地段属于一个军阀；但从那儿到被炸毁的药房隔壁的面包坊为止的四个街区，是另外一个军阀的地盘；如果她穿过那条街，向西再走半英里，那么她便会发现自己到了又一个军阀的领地，因此可能成为狙击手射杀的目标。人们现在都这样称呼妈妈的那些英雄。军阀。莱拉还听过有人称他们为枪手。也有一些人依然称他们为圣战者，不过他们这么说的时候会做鬼脸——满脸讽刺和呕吐的神色，带着深深的憎恶和轻蔑说出这个词。就像说出一句粗口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">IN JUNE OF THAT YEAR, 1992, there was heavy fighting in West Kabul between the Pashtun forces of the warlord Sayyaf and the Hazaras of the Wahdat faction. The shelling knocked down power lines, pulverized entire blocks of shops and homes. Laila heard that Pashtun militiamen were attacking Hazara households, breaking in and shooting entire families, execution style, and that Hazaras were retaliating by abducting Pashtun civilians, raping Pashtun girls, shelling Pashtun neighborhoods, and killing indiscriminately. Every day, bodies were found tied to trees, sometimes burned beyond recognition. Often, they'd been shot in the head, had had their eyes gouged out, their tongues cut out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一年，也就是1992年的6月，军阀沙耶夫的普什图武装部队和统一派的哈扎拉部队在西喀布尔大战一场。轰炸毁坏了电力系统，将大量的商店和平民百姓的住所夷为平地。莱拉听说普什图士兵到处袭击哈扎拉人的家，他们破门而入，满门抄斩；哈扎拉人也大肆报复，绑架普什图族的市民，强奸普什图族的女孩，轰炸普什图族的居住区，不分青红皂白地杀害普什图人。每一天都有尸体被人发现吊在树上，有时候还没有家属来认领就被草草掩埋。他们通常是头部中枪，眼珠被挖出来，舌头被割掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment, all of Mammy's talk of reputations and mynah birds sounded immaterial to Laila. Absurd, even. In the midst of all this killing and looting, all this ugliness, it was a harmless thing to sit here beneath a tree and kiss Tariq. A small thing. An easily forgivable indulgence. So she let him kiss her, and when he pulled back she leaned in and kissed him, heart pounding in her throat, her face tingling, a fire burning in the pit of her belly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻，妈妈说的所有那些什么名声、八哥的话在莱拉心中已经无足轻重。甚至荒唐透顶。在这一片兵荒马乱、人心惶惶之中，坐在一棵树下面和塔里克接吻是一件无伤大体的事情。一件小事情。一次不值得苛责的放纵。所以她任由他亲吻，当他向后退开时，她靠了过去，回吻着他，心头鹿儿撞，脸上发烧，小腹中有一股灼热的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took over the teaching duties himself. Laila went into his study every day after sundown, and, as Hekmatyar launched his rockets at Massoud from the southern outskirts of the city, Babi and she discussed the ghazals of Hafez and the works of the beloved Afghan poet Ustad Khalilullah Khalili. Babi taught her to derive the quadratic equation, showed her how to factor polynomials and plot parametric curves. When he was teaching, Babi was transformed. In his element, amid his books, he looked taller to Laila. His voice seemed to rise from a calmer, deeper place, and he didn't blink nearly as much. Laila pictured him as he must have been once, erasing his blackboard with graceful swipes, looking over a student's shoulder, fatherly and attentive.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is the area of a pyramid?" Babi would ask, and all Laila could think of was the fullness of Tariq's lips, the heat of his breath on her mouth, her own reflection in his hazel eyes. She'd kissed him twice more since the time beneath the tree, longer, more passionately, and, she thought, less clumsily. Both times, she'd met him secretly in the dim alley where he'd smoked a cigarette the day of Mammy's lunch party. The second time, she'd let him touch her breast.</div>
