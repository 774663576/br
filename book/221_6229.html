<div class="line_en">"I must have called or texted you both eighteen times. It was only when I managed to call the Dewars' house and somebody told me 'the man in the wheelchair' had gone to a hotel that I could be sure you hadn't both had some terrible accident on the motorway."</div>

<div class="line_en">But you could see he wasn't bothered. He was all loose and relaxed, carried his hangover with humour, even though I had the feeling he was in some pain. It was only when his mum started to have a go at Louisa that he stopped smiling. He jumped in and just said that if she had anything to say she should say it to him, as it had been his decision to stay overnight, and Louisa had simply gone along with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过看得出来他没有烦心，他完全放松，虽然宿醉，却依然非常幽默，即使我觉得他还承受着疼痛。直到他母亲开始责骂露易莎时，他才没有了笑容。他插话说如果她想说什么，应该对他说，因为是他决定在外过夜的，露易莎不过是听了他的吩咐罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Louisa looked a bit shaken but he had gone over and murmured something to her, and that was the point at which I saw it. She went kind of pink and laughed, the kind of laugh you do when you know you shouldn't be laughing. The kind of laugh that spoke of a conspiracy. And then Will turned to her and told her to take it easy for the rest of the day. Go home, get changed, maybe catch forty winks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露易莎看上去有点震惊，他转过头，对她小声说了什么，就在那会儿我看了出来。她脸红了，笑了起来，是那种你知道你不该笑时的那种笑，是那种谈到某个阴谋的一种笑。威尔告诉她这天剩下的时间放轻松些。回家，换个衣服，打个盹儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He deflated a little after she left. It was as if he had been holding on until both his mum and Louisa had left the annexe. I had been watching him carefully now, and once his smile left his face I realized I didn't like the look of him. His skin held a faint blotchiness, he had winced twice when he thought no one was looking, and I could see even from here that he had goosebumps. A little alarm bell had started to sound, distant but shrill, inside my head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她离开后他有点泄气。似乎他一直撑到他母亲和露易莎离开配楼。我仔细地看着他，一旦他的脸上不再有笑容，我就不喜欢他那副表情了。他的皮肤出现轻微的污斑，在他认为没人看他时，他皱了两次眉。我能看出他浑身冒冷汗。我的脑中响起了小声的警报，模糊但是尖锐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He closed his eyes. I checked his blood pressure again, wondering how long I should leave it before calling an ambulance. AD scared the hell out of me because you never knew which way it was going to go. He had had it once before, when I had first started working with him, and he had ended up in hospital for two days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他闭上了双眼。我又量了一下他的血压，思考着在叫救护车之前还能撑多久。自主神经反射异常把我吓得要死，因为你没法知道后果是什么。我开始为他工作时，他发过一次，后来在医院待了两天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Autonomic dysreflexia was pretty much our worst nightmare. It was Will's body's massive overreaction against pain, discomfort -- or, say, an un-emptied catheter -- his damaged nervous system's vain and misguided attempt to stay in control. It could come out of nowhere and send his body into meltdown. He looked pale, his breathing laboured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自主神经反射异常差不多是我们最可怕的噩梦，这是威尔的身体对疼痛、不适——或者说，没有清除的导尿管——的过激反应，是他受到损伤的神经系统徒劳而不对头地想稳住局势的尝试。它可能突然出现，让他的身体陷入崩溃。他脸色苍白，吃力地喘着气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“皮肤感觉怎样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took his pulse, and grabbed the blood pressure equipment. Sure enough, it was sky high. When I put my hand on his forehead it came away with a faint sheen of sweat. I went for the medicine cabinet, and crushed some vasodilator drugs. I gave them to him in water, making sure he drank every last bit. Then I propped him up, placing his legs over the side of the bed, and I changed his tubes swiftly, watching him all the while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把了一下他的脉，抓过血压测量计。不出所料，高得上了天。我摸了摸他的前额，出汗了。我来到药品柜，捣碎了一些血管舒张药，用水让他冲服，看着他喝下最后一点，然后我把他支起来，把他的腿放在床边，迅速地更换了他的管子，在这期间一直看着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My own view of Louisa Clark was a little less generous just at that moment. "Will, mate, I think maybe next time you should worry a little more about yourself, yeah?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He told me Louisa had been so drunk he hadn't wanted to risk letting her loose on his equipment. "God knows where she might have stuck the ruddy tubes." He half laughed as he said it. It had taken Louisa almost half an hour just to get him out of his chair and into bed, he said. They had both ended up on the floor twice. "Luckily we were both so drunk by then I don't think either of us felt a thing." She had had the presence of mind to call down to reception, and they had asked a porter to help lift him. "Nice chap. I have a vague memory of insisting Louisa give him a fifty-pound tip. I knew she was properly drunk because she agreed to it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉我露易莎喝得太醉了，他不敢冒险让她松开他的设备。“天知道她会把该死的管子插到哪里去。”他半笑着说。把他从轮椅中弄到床上几乎花了露易莎一个小时，他说。他们两人两次跌到地板上。“幸运的是，当时我们都太醉了，没人有一点感觉。”她还镇定自若地打电话给前台，他们叫了一个搬运工过来抬他。“好家伙。我模糊记得我坚持让露易莎给他五十英镑的小费。我知道她肯定喝醉了，因为她同意了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We chatted a bit, passing the time while everything settled down, discussing the previous day's events. He didn't seem a bit bothered about his ex. He didn't say much, but for all he was obviously exhausted, he looked okay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们聊了一会儿，在一切都安定下来的过程中消磨着时间，讨论前一天发生的事情。他一点没受前女友的困扰。他没有说多少，尽管他明显很累，但看上去还不错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave me a wry look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对我做了个鬼脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Despite the sweats and the pain and the infection, he looked for once like there was something else on his mind other than the thing that consumed him. I couldn't help thinking that if Mrs Traynor had known this, she might not have kicked off as hard as she did.</div>

<div class="line_en">We didn't tell her anything of the lunchtime events -- Will made me promise not to -- but when Lou came back later that afternoon she was pretty quiet. She looked pale, with her hair washed and pulled back like she was trying to look sensible. I kind of guessed how she felt; sometimes when you get hammered till the small hours you feel pretty good in the morning, but really it's just because you're still a bit drunk. That old hangover is just toying with you, working out when to bite. I figured it must have bitten her around lunchtime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中午的事情我们一点儿也没告诉她——威尔让我承诺不告诉她——但是露那天下午晚些时候回来时，非常安静。她脸色苍白，头发洗过了，披在脑后，像是她想尽量看上去得体些。我有点猜到她的想法。有时你喝高了，直到凌晨你都觉得很好，不过那只是因为你还有点醉。该死的宿醉在玩弄你，在计算什么时候咬你。我估摸着午餐时间她肯定一直在被啃噬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Will kept on and on at her about why she was being so quiet, and then she said, "Yes, well, I've discovered it's not the most sensible thing to stay out all night when you've just moved in with your boyfriend."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔一直问她为什么这么安静，她说：“如果你刚刚跟男朋友住在一起就在外面过夜不太理智。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We didn't do much that afternoon. Louisa emptied Will's backpack, revealing every free hotel shampoo, conditioner, miniature sewing kit and shower cap she could lay her hands on. ("Don't laugh," she said. "At those prices, Will paid for a bloody shampoo factory.") We watched some Japanese animated film which Will said was perfect hangover viewing, and I stuck around -- partly because I wanted to keep an eye on his blood pressure and partly, to be honest, because I was being a bit mischievous. I wanted to see his reaction when I announced I was going to keep them both company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个下午我们没有做什么。露易莎倒空威尔的背包，里面是她能找到的所有免费的旅馆洗发水、护发剂、小号缝纫针线包、浴帽。（“别笑，”她说，“以那个价格，威尔都能买下一个洗发水工厂了。”）我们看了一部日本的动画片，威尔说非常适合宿醉的人看。我在附近逗留——部分原因是想留神查看他的血压，还有部分其他原因。老实说来，我有点顽皮，我想看看我说要陪他们两人一起时他的反应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So we watched the film. Pulled down the blinds, took the phone off the hook, and watched this weird cartoon about a girl who ends up in a parallel universe, with all these weird creatures, half of whom you couldn't tell if they were good or bad. Lou sat right up close to Will, handing him his drink or, at one point, wiping his eye when he got something in it. It was quite sweet, really, although a little bit of me wondered what on earth this was going to lead to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们看了那部电影。拉下百叶窗，把电话拿下来，看了这部奇特的动画片，片中的女孩最后和所有诡异的生物一起去了一个平行世界，里面一半的人物你不能评论他们到底是好是坏。露坐得离威尔很近，给他递饮料，某些时刻他眼睛里有东西时，露就擦他的眼睛，真的非常甜蜜。我有点想知道这件事到底会如何发展。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He caught himself immediately, saying that of course I would love it… it was a great film… blah, blah, blah. But there it was. I was glad for him, on one level. He had thought about one thing for too long, that man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他突然住嘴，说当然我会喜欢这部电影……这是一部伟大的电影……一大堆废话，但那种情绪分明存在。从某种程度来说，我很为他高兴。他已经考虑一件事情太长时间，那个男人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, as Louisa pulled up the blinds and made us all some tea, they looked at each other like two people wondering whether to let you in on a secret, and they told me about going away. Ten days. Not sure where yet, but it would probably be long haul and it would be good. Would I come and help?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当露易莎拉开百叶窗，给我们泡了茶时，他们俩看着彼此就像两个深藏心事的人在犹豫要不要告诉我。他们告诉我要离开，十天，还不确定去哪儿，但估计是长途旅行，会很美妙。我是否能来帮帮忙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have to tell you, I was really pleased. That ruddy online poker site had eaten all my money, and I wasn't even planning on a holiday this year. I even forgave Louisa for being stupid enough to listen to Will when he said he hadn't wanted her to do his tubes. And believe me, I had been pretty pissed about that. So it was all looking great, and I was whistling when I shouldered my way into my coat, already looking forward to white sands and blue seas. I was even trying to work out if I could tie in a short visit home to Auckland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我得告诉你，我很高兴。那个该死的在线扑克网站吞掉了我所有的钱，我今年都没计划去度个假。我甚至原谅了露易莎的愚蠢，当威尔说他不想让她帮忙换管子时，她听信了威尔的话。相信我，我对此相当生气。现在看来一切都很好，我穿外套时还吹起了口哨，已经在期待白色的沙滩和碧蓝的海。我甚至在想是不是可以顺便回奥克兰的家里小住几天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had to take my hat off to the girl. If you had told me four months ago that we'd get Will off on a long-haul holiday -- hell, that we would get him out of this house -- I would have told you that you were a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
