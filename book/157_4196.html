<div class="line_en">In those days the cattlemen were the anointed. They were the grandees of the grass, kings of the kine, lords of the lea, barons of beef and bone. They might have ridden in golden chariots had their tastes so inclined. The cattleman was caught in a stampede of dollars. It seemed to him that he had more money than was decent. But when he had bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs, and a California saddle with silver nails and Angora skin suaderos, and ordered everybody up to the bar for whisky -- what else was there for him to spend money for?</div>

<div class="line_en">In the little frontier city of Chaparosa, Longley built a costly residence. Here he became a captive, bound to the chariot of social existence. He was doomed to become a leading citizen. He struggled for a time like a mustang in his first corral, and then he hung up his quirt and spurs. Time hung heavily on his hands. He organised the First National Bank of Chaparosa, and was elected its president.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The bank checks up all right, Mr. Longley," said Todd; "and I find your loans in very good shape -- with one exception. You are carrying one very bad bit of paper -- one that is so bad that I have been thinking that you surely do not realise the serious position it places you in. I refer to a call loan of $10,000 made to Thomas Merwin. Not only is the amount in excess of the maximum sum the bank can loan any individual legally, but it is absolutely without endorsement or security. Thus you have doubly violated the national banking laws, and have laid yourself open to criminal prosecution by the Government. A report of the matter to the Comptroller of the Currency -- which I am bound to make -- would, I am sure, result in the matter being turned over to the Department of Justice for action. You see what a serious thing it is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“帐目都很清楚，朗利先生，”托德说，“我发现你的贷款也都符合手续——不过有一笔例外。有一张借据很糟糕——糟到这种程度，我猜想你一定还不了解情况的严重性。我指的是那笔借给托马斯·默温的一万元活期贷款。问题不仅在于数目超过了银行发放私人贷款的最高限额，而且既无担保，又无抵押。因此，你在两方面都违犯了国民银行法，政府随时都可以向你提出刑事诉讼。假如把这件事报告货币审计处——我有责任这么做——我相信一定会移交司法部执行。你该明白情况有多么严重了吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bill Longley was leaning his lengthy, slowly moving frame back in his swivel chair. His hands were clasped behind his head, and he turned a little to look the examiner in the face. The examiner was surprised to see a smile creep about the rugged mouth of the banker, and a kindly twinkle in his light-blue eyes. If he saw the seriousness of the affair, it did not show in his countenance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔·朗利坐在转椅上，颀长的身躯慢慢向后靠去。他双手合抱，托着后脑，略微侧过头，望着稽核。稽核看到银行家果断的嘴角上泛起一丝笑容，浅蓝色的眼睛里闪着和善的亮光，不禁有点纳闷。等到他了解了这件事的严重性时，他的脸色就不会这样了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course, you don't know Tom Merwin," said Longley, almost genially. "Yes, I know about that loan. It hasn't any security except Tom Merwin's word. Somehow, I've always found that when a man's word is good it's the best security there is. Oh, yes, I know the Government doesn't think so. I guess I'll see Tom about that note."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，这也难怪，你根本不认识汤姆·默温。”朗利几乎是亲切地说。“不错，我知道这笔贷款。除了汤姆·默温一句话以外，没有任何抵押品。不过我一向认为，一个人只要讲信用，他的话就是最好的抵押品。哦，是呀，我知道政府不是这样想的。看来我还是为这笔贷款去找一次汤姆。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="托德先生的消化不良症仿佛突然恶化了。他从放大镜似的眼镜后面惊讶地瞅着这位牧牛人出身的银行家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see," said Longley, easily explaining the thing away, "Tom heard of 2000 head of two-year-olds down near Rocky Ford on the Rio Grande that could be had for $8 a head. I reckon 'twas one of old Leandro Garcia's outfits that he had smuggled over, and he wanted to make a quick turn on 'em. Those cattle are worth $15 on the hoof in Kansas City. Tom knew it and I knew it. He had $6,000, and I let him have the $10,000 to make the deal with. His brother Ed took 'em on to market three weeks ago. He ought to be back 'most any day now with the money. When he comes Tom'll pay that note."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你明白，”朗利轻松地解释说，想了结这件事，“汤姆听说格朗德河岩石津那里有两千头两岁的小牛出售，每头八块钱就可以成交。我猜想那大概是老莱恩德罗·加尔西亚私运进来的牛队，急于脱手。那群牛到堪萨斯城可以卖十五元一头。汤姆清楚，我也清楚。他有六千元现款，我就把这笔交易的不足之数一万元借给了他。他弟弟埃德三星期前把牛赶去卖了。这几天里，他随时可能带着货款回来。他一来，汤姆就会归还借款的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bank examiner was shocked. It was, perhaps, his duty to step out to the telegraph office and wire the situation to the Comptroller. But he did not.

And then he offered a tiny loophole of escape.</div>

It was near the edge of the little town, and few citizens were in the neighbourhood at that hour. Merwin wore two six-shooters in a belt, and a slouch hat. He moved swiftly down a lonely street, and then followed the sandy road that ran parallel to the narrow-gauge track until he reached the water- tank, two miles below the town. There Tom Merwin stopped, tied a black silk handkerchief about the lower part of his face, and pulled his hat down low.</div>
