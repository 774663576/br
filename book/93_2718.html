<div class="line_en">Shortly before daylight, Robert began to stir. He stretched his shoulders, feeling his bones grind against one another as they found their normal junction With a great deal of effort, first his right eye, then his left, opened against the cloak of tears and dirt that had sealed them shut while he slept. "I can't see," he thought. "Have I gone blind? Are my eyes even open? Are there bandages on them? I can't be sure."He touched his cheek with a forefinger, tracing gently toward the outer edge of his left eye."Yes, they're wide open. They sore!"He rubbed his eyes, loosening the clogged coarse veil, then blinking them and effusing tears to refresh them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the colonel awakened, Robert allowed himself the venture of reflecting on the events of the previous day. It was beyond his understanding how they could have found themselves victimized so easily. There was nothing in the dawning of yesterday to warrant the hostile change that was to happen. But there had been warning signs that something bad was pending.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that he had more room, he uncoiled his raw body, feeling his blood saturate his limbs, his trunk and his brain. He yearned to leave this place and the swell of flesh that continued to rumble and chew in its sleep. I can't do that. I have to get us out of this dilemma. I guess I'll just wait until this bull rouses. By then I should have a plan. Whether he likes it or not, I am taking charge. He must concede his authority to me. I'm not going to let his humiliating behavior be my downfall.' He narrated to himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Robert rolled away from his companion, shrewdly lest he would disturb the man's sleep. The Curtain of darkness was lifting without restraint and he could perceive and acquaint himself a little more with his surroundings. The refuge in which they were staying he found was really quite spacious. He felt the smooth surface of the granite against his back.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Earl of Morley was a man with ambitions. He had a strong desire to conquer and obtain. Once he decided he wanted something, be it property or county maiden, through conspiracy or erroneous plot, he would rejoice his selfishness by whatever means necessary. He was never shameful for his greed and being of no virtue at all. The origin of yesterday's conflagration was the Earl's lusty craving for the daughter of Lord Stafford.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Janine, the Lord's only child, was spending a vocation with her tutor in a village on the edge of the Earl's extensive land when the Earl first saw her. Her beauty did not escape him, and he immediately began to pursue her, shrewdly immersing himself into her company. He also flattered her every chance he got. Lady Janine, a haughty young woman, was indifferent to his unwelcome courtship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not a man to take rejection lightly, the Earl's initial response normally would have been simply to kidnap the object of his passion. This time, however, he made a resolution that he coveted more than just a casual companionship with the young lady. He wanted her to be obedient, to accept him as her husband. With this in mind, and following the rules of social custom of the day, he sent an agent, a monk from the monastery near the village, to her father to relay his message and act on his behalf. As a sign of good faith, the monk was to present the lady with a ring in which was set a ruby of huge proportions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位伯爵不会对拒绝掉以轻心，他最初的反应通常是简单地绑架他的激情对象。然而，这一次，他下定决心，他渴望的不仅仅是与这位年轻女士的一次偶然的友谊。他希望她听话，接受他为自己的丈夫。考虑到这一点，并遵循当时的社会习俗，他从村庄附近的寺院派了一个代理人，一个僧侣到她那里父亲传达他的信息并代表他行事。为了表示诚意，修道士要送给这位女士一枚镶嵌着巨大红宝石的戒指。">查看中文翻译</div>

In return, he taught her to do mathematical operations, something he had always done in his head before she taught him the symbols for the numbers. He worshipped her.
