<div class="line_en">They started back to the car in silence. She was thinking about how all things and people seemed to go about in disguise. An old Czech town was covered with Russian names. Czechs taking pictures of the invasion had unconsciously worked for the secret police. The man who sent her to die had worn a mask of Tomas's face over his own. The spy played the part of an engineer, and the engineer tried to play the part of the man from Petrin. The emblem of the book in his flat proved a sham designed to lead her astray.</div>

<div class="line_en">Recalling the book she had held in her hand there, she had a sudden flash of insight that made her cheeks burn red. What had been the sequence of events? The engineer announced he would bring in some coffee. She walked over to the book-shelves and took down Sophocles' Oedipus. Then the engineer came back. But without the coffee!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，想到她曾经拿在手里的那本书，她脑海里闪过一个念头，双颊顿时涨得通红：事情到底是怎样发生的？工程师说他去煮咖啡。她走近书架，抽出索福克勒斯的《俄狄浦斯》。接着，工程师回来了。但是没有拿咖啡呀！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again and again she returned to that situation: How long was he away when he went for the coffee? Surely a minute at the least. Maybe two or even three. And what had he been up to for so long in that miniature anteroom? Or had he gone to the toilet? She tried to remember hearing the door shut or the water flush. No, she was positive she'd heard no water; she would have remembered that. And she was almost certain the door hadn't closed. What had he been up to in that anteroom?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她反反复复地回想着当时的情形：他是什么时候借口准备咖啡走开的？他走开了多长时间？至少一分钟，毋庸置疑。或者两分钟，甚或三分钟。他待在那个小门厅里那么长时间干什么？他是上厕所了？特蕾莎拼命回忆自己是否听见了门的砰嗒声或者冲水的哗啦声。没有，她肯定没有听见水的声音，不然她会想起来的。而且，她差不多也可以肯定，她没有听见门的砰嗒声。那么，他在门厅里到底干什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they walked down the garden-lined steps leading back to the square, Tomas asked her, What's wrong?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们下了花园间的一段台阶，朝他们停车的广场走去。“你怎么了？”托马斯问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only a few weeks earlier, she had scoffed at Prochazka for failing to see that he lived in a concentration camp, where privacy ceased to exist. But what about her? By getting out from under her mother's roof, she thought in all innocence that she had once and for all become master of her privacy. But no, her mother's roof stretched out over the whole world and would never let her be. Tereza would never escape her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在几个星期之前，她还为普罗恰兹卡不知自己生活在不能有任何私人空间的集中营里感到惊讶。可是她自己呢？从母亲家搬出来后，她就天真地以为自己从此成了个人生活的主宰。然而，母亲的家布及全世界，随时随地会抓住她。特蕾莎无处可逃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was only too clear. If they meant to trap her, they would need more than the engineer's testimony. They would need incontrovertible evidence. In the course of his suspiciously long absence, the engineer could only have been setting up a movie camera in the anteroom. Or, more likely, he had let in someone with a still camera, who then had photographed them from behind the curtain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，事情再也清楚不过了。要让她入陷阱，仅有工程师的证词是不够的。他们需要无可辩驳的证据。工程师在走开那么久的可疑的时间里，他是在门厅里装了台摄像机。或者，更说得通的是，他领进了一个带照相机的家伙，藏在帘子后面，把他们的一切全都拍了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
