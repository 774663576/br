<div class="line_en">They waited patiently for a very long time, jumping up and down in the snow to keep warm. At last they heard feet coming slowly towards the door. Then the door opened, just enough to show a long nose and pair of sleepy eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And who," said a deep, angry voice, "is making visits at this time of night?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是谁，”一个低沉、愠怒的声音问道，“这么晚还来串门？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, Badger," cried the Rat, "let us in, please. It's me, Rat, and my friend Mole, and we're lost in the snow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，獾，”水鼠叫道，“请让我们进去。是我，水鼠，还有我的朋友鼹鼠，我们在雪地里迷路了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" said the Badger, in a very different voice. "My dear Ratty! Lost in the snow, and in the Wild Wood! Come in at once, both of you, and get yourselves warm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”獾用完全不同的语调说，“亲爱的阿鼠！在雪地里迷路，在野树林！赶快进来，你们俩，先暖和暖和。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was a wonderful moment for the Mole and the Rat, when they heard the door close behind them, shutting out the Wild Wood. They followed the Badger down long dark tunnels until they came into a large kitchen. There was a bright fire, with comfortable armchairs round it, and a great wooden table with long seats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到门在他们身后关起来，把野树林隔离在外，对鼹鼠和水鼠来说，这真是美妙的时刻。他们跟着獾向下走过长长的黑通道，来到一个大大的厨房。那儿有明亮的炉火，四周摆放着舒服的扶手椅，一张特大的木桌和长椅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is not the kind of night for small animals to be out," the Badger said, in a fatherly way. "Sit yourselves down by the fire, while I get you some supper."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's going from bad to worse," said the Rat sadly. "He had another crash only last week, and a bad one. You see, he thinks he's a wonderful driver, the best in the world. But he isn't. He's terrible! But he won't take lessons, he won't lis ten to anyone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的情况越来越糟糕了，”水鼠难过地说，“上星期他又撞车了，很严重。你知道，他自己认为他是驾车能手，是世界上最好的。但是他不是，他很差劲！但他不吸取教训，也听不进别人的劝告。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the Badger said, "Now then! Tell me the news from your part of the world. How's old Toad getting on?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后獾安慰道，“现在好了！告诉我你们那边的消息，老蛤蟆怎么样啦？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How many has he had?" the Badger asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他已有多少了？”獾问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Crashes, or motor-cars?" asked the Rat. "Well, with Toad, it's the same thing. This is the seventh car, and the seventh crash. His garage is full to the roof with bits of broken motor car!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“撞车，还是汽车？”水鼠问。“不过，对于蛤蟆来说是一样的。这是第七辆车，也是第七次撞车。他的车库里堆满了撞坏的汽车残骸！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's been in hospital twice," the Mole added. "The police have arrested him for dangerous driving three or four times. And he's spending so much money!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他还住了两次医院，”鼹鼠补充道。“因为危险驾车，他被警察抓过三四次，他正在花大把的钱呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon the Mole and the Rat were warm and dry, and the dangers of the Wild Wood seemed a long way away, like a bad dream. Then supper arrived. It was enough for ten small hungry animals, and the Rat and the Mole realized just how hungry they were. When at last they could eat no more, they sat with the Badger round the fire, and told him the story of their adventures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快他们就烤干了衣服，也感觉暖和了，野树林的危险像一场恶梦显得已很遥远。晚餐准备好了。它够十只饥饿的小动物吃个饱，水鼠和鼹鼠也才意识到他们已饥肠辘辘了。他们吃饱了以后，便与獾围坐在火炉边，说着他们的危险经历。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Badger thought for a while. "You know, don't you, that I can't do anything now?" he said at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="獾想了一会儿，最后说，“你知道的，难道你忘了，我现在什么也干不成吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's another problem," the Rat went on. "Toad's rich, we all know that; but his money won't last for ever. Sooner or later, one of two things will happen. He'll kill himself in a crash, or he'll have no money left at all. Badger! We're his friends -- can't we do something?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是另一个问题，”水鼠接着说。“癞蛤蟆很富，我们大家都知道；但他不可能永远有钱的。迟早总有一件事要发生。他要么被撞死在车祸中，要么一无所有。獾！我们是他的朋友——难道我们不能为他做些什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no, of course not," the Rat and the Mole said together. Everybody knew that in the animal world the winter was a time for rest and sleep. Nobody wanted to do anything important or tiring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，当然不是现在，”水鼠和鼹鼠齐声说。每个人都知道，在动物世界里冬季是休息和睡眠的季节，没有谁想干任何重要或吃力的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two tired animals slept long and deeply, and came down to breakfast very late indeed. In the kitchen they found two young hedgehogs, busy with bowls of bread and hot milk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两只疲倦的动物沉沉入睡了很长时间，的确很迟才下来吃早餐。在厨房里他们看见两只小豪猪正忙着吃碗里的面包和热牛奶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very well," continued the Badger. "But when the days are longer and warmer, then we'll do something. We -- you and me and our friend the Mole here -- we'll try to teach Toad a lesson. We won't listen to any silliness. We'll bring him back to reason, and turn him into a sensible Toad at last. But now, it's time for bed. Don't hurry tomorrow morning -- come for breakfast as late as you want!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”獾继续说。“但是日子变长变暖后，我们还是会干些事的。我们——你和我，还有我们的朋友，鼹鼠——我们设法教训他一下。我们不愿再听到任何蠢事了。我们要让他恢复理智，最后变成聪明的癞蛤螅但是现在该睡觉了，明天早上不要赶时间——睡够了再用早餐！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hello!" said the Rat pleasantly. "Where did you two come from? Lost your way in the snow, I suppose?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们好！”水鼠愉快地说，“你们俩从哪儿来？在雪地里迷路了吧，我猜？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," said one of the hedgehogs politely. "We got lost on the way to school, and Mr Badger said we could come in and have some breakfast."</div>

<div class="line_en">The breakfast things were all ready on the table, and the Mole and the Rat quickly got to work. The Rat made the coffee while the Mole fried several pieces of bread and an enormous number of eggs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早餐配料已准备好在桌子上，鼹鼠和水鼠很快开始工作。水鼠煮咖啡，鼹鼠煎了几片面包和一大堆鸡蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get off!" said the Raf, with his mouth full of fried bread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走开！”水鼠说道，嘴里塞满了煎面包。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the door bell rang, one of the hedgehogs went to answer the door. He came back followed by the Otter, who gave a shout of happiness when he saw the Rat. He ran across the room and almost knocked the Rat off his chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门铃响了，一只豪猪起身去开门，回来时后面跟着水獭，当他看见水鼠，高兴地叫了起来。他小跑着穿过房间，差点把水鼠从椅子上撞了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thought I'd find you here all right," said the Otter happily. "Everybody along the river bank has been so worried about you. Rat never came home last night, and nor did Mole; something terrible has happened, they said. But if anyone's in trouble, Badger usually gets to hear about it, so I came straight here this morning. And oh my, didn't the Wild Wood look grand, with the snow everywhere and the red sun coming up, shining through the black trees! Halfway here I met one of those silly rabbits. He told me that Mole had lost his way last night, and that "They" were out and chasing him all over the wood. I'd like to meet one of "Them" myself this morning, and tell them what I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想我会在这儿见到你们安安全全的，”水獭高兴地说，“河岸边的每个人一直都很担心你们。他们说，水鼠昨晚没回家，鼹鼠也没有，一定发生了什么可怕的事。但是，只要有人遇到麻烦，獾常常能听说点什么的，因此我今早就直接过来了。噢，野树林是不是看起来很壮观，到处都是积雪，红红的太阳升起来，透过茂密的树林照射下来！半路上我碰到一只傻野兔，他说昨晚鼹鼠迷了路；‘他们’出来，满树林里追赶他。我今早倒愿意碰见‘他们’中的一个，然后告诉他我是怎么想的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is a wonderful, comfortable home you have here," he said. "There's really nothing better than a place underground like this. You can shut off the world up there when you don't want it. And when you do, you can just go up and there's the world waiting for you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Afraid?" The Otter laughed and showed this strong white teeth. "I don't think any of them would argue with me. Here, Mole, be a good fellow and fry me some eggs. I'm terribly hungry, and I've got a lot to talk about with Ratty here. Haven't seen him for weeks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“害怕？”水獭笑起来，露出他那坚硬的白齿，“我想他们中还没谁敢和我作对吧。好了，鼹鼠，好伙计，给我煎些蛋。我饿得很，而我现在有许多话要和阿鼠说，几个星期没见他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hedgehogs were sent home, the breakfast things were cleared away, and soon the four animals sat down to lunch together. The Rat and the Otter were having a long conversation about river-bank matters, so the Mole began to talk to the Badger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="豪猪被送回家了，早餐的用品也被清理干净，不久这四只动物又坐在一起吃午饭了。水鼠一直和水獭聊着河岸边的事情，因此鼹鼠开始和獾交谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Weren't you at all -- um -- afraid?" asked the Mole, remembering how frightened he had been.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Mole agreed with everything that the Badger said. His own little home was underground, so it was natural for him to feel comfortable there. He and the Badger became very friendly, and after lunch the Badger took him all round his home, down tunnel after tunnel, through room after room. The Mole was interested in everything and thought it was all wonderful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼹鼠非常同意獾的说法。他自己的小家就在地下，因此他觉得这儿舒服是很自然的。他和獾之间变得非常的默契，午餐后，獾带他去参观他的家，向下穿过了一个又一个通道，走过了一间又一间房子。鼹鼠对什么都感兴趣，认为这里的一切都是那么美妙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they got back to the kitchen, the Rat was walking up and down, very restless. Unlike the Mole, he didn't really feel comfortable underground. He wanted to be back in his own home, where the windows looked out over the river, and where he could hear the wind whispering through the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们回到厨房，水鼠正在那儿来回踱步，一副很不安的样子。不像鼹鼠，他在地下感到不太舒服，他想回到他自己的家，在那儿，从窗户里能看见潺潺河水，能听到风过河岸树时的轻轻低语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Badger smiled warmly at him. "That's just what I say," he replied. "Down here, you're safe and dry and warm. With a house above ground, you've got to worry about fire, and wind and rain, holes in the roof and broken windows. No, above ground is fine in its way, but one's home should be underground."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="獾对他温和地微笑着。“这正是我的看法，”他回答道，“在地下，你是安全、干燥、温暖的。住在地面上的房子里，你得担心火、风和雨，还有房顶上的洞和破窗户。是的，从某种意义上说，地上的房子是不错，但‘家’应该在地下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come along, Mole," he said. "We must get off while it's daylight. We don't want to spend another night lost in the Wild Wood."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You mustn't worry, Ratty," added the Badger calmly. "My tunnels go further than you think, and I've several back doors at the edge of the wood -- although I keep them secret from most people."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不必担心，阿鼠，”獾平静地补充道。“我的地道要比你们想的远得多，在树林的尽头，我开了几个后门——尽管我对大多数人都保守着这个秘密。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the journey home was really very easy. When they came out of the Badger's secret back door, they found a path across the fields and soon they could see the river in front of them.

Then he hurried on after the others, happy to be back in the open fields, and looking forward to the bright firelight of home.</div>
