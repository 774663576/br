<div class="line_en">It is important in this world to know to whom one is attractive. There was once a particularly touching advertisement for mosquito repellent that began, "One person in two thousand is naturally unattractive to mosquitoes." Alas, sitting on the terrace of the small hotel in Garoua, it was painfully clear that I did not fall into that category. The mosquitoes of that city are determined and vicious, taking time off from relentless procreation only to savage hapless humans. When the doughty female explorer Olive McLeod visited the city just after the turn of the century and had dinner with the German governor, liveried servants placed a domesticated toad at the side of each of the guests to lessen the ravages of the bloodsucking insects.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Dowayoland, I had encountered baboons, possibly the least lovely of simians. Troops of them lived a vocal and arid existence in the rocks beside the path that led to the rain-chief's domain. As I crawled along that sickeningly precipitous track, they would scream and gibber at me and occasionally throw rocks. I suspect now, however, that what I took for rage and aggression was merely a manifestation of frustrated love.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I sat and contemplated the beauties of nature, I was approached by a baboon. It sat and regarded me with obvious interest from the river bank, exploring its body for fleas in a most immodest fashion. Soon a certain sympathy had developed between us and it daintily picked its way on all fours to where I sat and stared fixedly into my face as if hoping to find I was a long-lost relative. Suddenly it yawned and apparently pointed to something over my head. So great was the sympathy between us that it never occurred to me that this was not a gesture intended for me and I turned round to see what was being pointed at. The baboon, profiting from my distraction, seìzed my left nipple through my open shirt and began sucking on it vigorously. It did not take this sagacious beast long to realize that this was a fruitless endeavour and we withdrew in mutual embarrassment, the baboon going so far as to spit most offensively. It is possible that this incident was in part responsible for the idea of the missing mastectomy and attendant events. These I shall relate later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐在石头上，沉思自然之美，一只狒狒走来。它坐在河对岸，兴味盎然打量我，一边毫不体面搔抓身上的虱子。没多久，我们之间就产生一种共鸣好感，它四肢着地、优雅挑选好走的路到我身旁，直盯盯望着我，好似我是它失联已久的亲人。突然间，它打了个哈欠，指指我脑后的方向。我们之间的共鸣实在太强烈，以致我完全没想到它的动作并非针对我，我转过头去看它到底在指什么。狒狒趁我分心之际，将手探入我敞开的衬衫，抓住我的乳头，开始用力吸吮。这只精明的野兽马上发现吸吮徒劳无功，和我一样大感羞愧，连忙后退，它还鄙夷地连连朝地上啐口水。我想要寻找“失落的乳房切除术”以及之后发生的事，和这件意外可能不无关系。不过，容后再述。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My next encounter with a baboon was when seated on a rock in the middle of a river. In the environs of Ngaoundere was a pleasant spot where the river dropped a clear fifty or sixty feet in a beautiful waterfall. The air was always coot and full of rainbows and dragonflies. A conveniently situated rock made a fine place to sit and bask.</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out subsequently that the local zoo had two baby monkeys. I do not know what kind they were -- apes, chimpanzees, gorillas, they are all my children. The female of the pair had died. The male had been plunged into deepest mourning. Being an intelligent creature, it had noted that the padlock of its cage was defective. The keeper, in accordance with the regulations that governed his endeavours, had applied in triplicate to the capital for a new padlock. No answer had been received. Any manner of fastening the cage that resisted the monkey's overnight attempts to open it proved too onerous and inconvenient for the keeper. Any less final form of closure enabled the monkey to undo the fastening and wander at will during the hours of darkness. But it always returned to its cage by morning, the only home it had ever known. A standing arrangement had evolved to the mutual satisfaction of both parties.</div>

<div class="line_en">In return for being available for public inspection during the day, the monkey was now permitted to engage in nocturnal excursions that had greatly improved its morale. Each evening, it would patiently undo the lock on its door, swing itself into the trees and embark upon a search for suitable company. It has to be confessed that it had sometimes abused this privilege through high spirits but had never failed to report for work in the morning. One of its favourite haunts was the swimming pool of the luxury hotel next door. It delighted in insinuating itself into the changing-huts, plundering the clothes there and retiring to the safety of the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了酬庸这只猴子愿意白天供人注视，园方允许它夜里浪游此举于它的士气大有助益。每天晚上，它耐心打开笼锁，爬上树梢荡秋千，寻找合适的伴侣。有时它会过于亢奋，滥用特权，但从未上午不返回工作岗位。它最爱的冶游地点是动物园旁豪华大旅馆的游泳池，兴高采烈潜进更衣室，劫掠里面的衣物，窜回安全的树上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There it would explore the wallets and purses of foreign tourists, raining money, travel documents and doubtless private secrets on the heads of those below, immune to their cries and cajoleries.

<div class="line_en">Spotting it, a waiter immediately rushed over to hit it on the head with a rock. This represents a fairly standard Cameroonian response to wildlife. Knowingly, it slid both arms around my neck and slid into my lap, baring green, horribly fetid teeth at its tormentor. Only with the utmost difficulty did I persuade the waiter that it was more reasonable not to hit the monkey -- now firmly clamped to me like a limpet mine -- so that it would surely savage me nastily, but rather to seek to lure it away with a dish of peanuts. Scowling and muttering, the waiter finally complied, making it abundantly clear that a charge would be made for the nuts. The monkey, however, was not to be parted from me. It began to snore, breathing rank halitosis in my face, disdaining proffered treats. Well-meaning attempts to disentangle its arms produced enraged barks and baring of surely rabid fangs. Stroking its head brought sighs and grunts of such deep sadness that it would have taken a stonier heart than my own to seek to discard the beast.</div>

<div class="line_en">Life is full of those actions that seem perfectly reasonable at the time. The logic of a situation is a purely local thing. Many actions, when looked back upon, seem bizarre and inexplicable. "Why don't we just take him along?" suggested Bob. At that particular moment, nothing seemed more natural than that I should take the snoring simian along to the cinema with me. A few tentatively exploratory movements revealed that motion was permitted as long as one hand was kept free to caress the beast. Otherwise, there was more baring of teeth and snarling. It required only slightly more dexterity than that of the average contortionist to insinuate myself into a jacket not designed for a man wearing a monkey and to button it up over the creature. In the damp heat of the evening I felt very warm indeed. Good fortune had provided me with a truck borrowed from my long-suffering friends at the mission. We set off for the cinema, an oddly assorted trio.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="生命充满“当时当刻”看来完全合理的事情，许多行为事后观之，根本诡异不可解，但形势逻辑纯粹因时因地而异。巴布提议“我们何不带着它去看电影？”当时，这似乎再自然不过，我应当带着这只打呼的类人猿进戏院。我们试验了几下，发现只要我腾出只手抚摸它，它愿意让我起身走动，一停止抚摸，它便龇牙咧嘴咆哮。我只需发挥比软体功艺人更高的灵活技术，就能将自己塞进，显然不是设计给“身上挂猴”者穿的外套，扣上它，遮住这畜生的身体。在潮湿闷热的那个夜晚，我觉得“温暖”异常。幸好我运气不错，教会朋友借了我一辆卡车。我们出发前往戏院——搭配诡异的三人组。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The problem was that Bob and I had set our hearts on a visit to the cinema. Cinemas do not loom large in the accounts of anthropologists yet they are curiously important when in the field. Normally totally inaccessible, they become a focus for feelings of deprivation and nostalgia. Whenever in a town, they must be visited. It does not matter that one knows in advance that the film will be terrible, the soundtrack incomprehensible, the experience full of heat and dust and sweat. It must be done nevertheless. And in town there was a new wonder. An entirely new picture palace had just been opened. It even had seats and a roof. Air-conditioning was promised at any moment. This very evening was one when the film, though doubtless far from new, was not a kung-fu spectacular or a Muslim epic concerned with the monumental slaying of unbelievers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题是巴布与我打算去看电影。电影对人类学家原本不算什么奇怪的，到了田野场上却重要万分。我们往往没机会看电影，它变成被剥夺感与怀旧的焦点。只要进城，你非得上戏院不可。不管你事先知道上映的片子很烂、音轨模糊不清、观影经验是灰尘扬天，闷热、汗流浃背。总之，非看不可。况且，城里有了新奇观。一家新戏院刚开张。它有座位、屋顶，甚至号称随时都正常运作的冷气。今晚上演的电影虽不是新片，但难能可贵，不是功夫奇技电影，也不是对不信教者大开杀戒的穆斯林史诗电影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We queued at the ticket office, various members of the public eyeing my snoring paunch with suspicion. To my great distress, the monkey was detected by the fiery ticket-seller who flared her nostrils at me and called the French manager. I fully expected this to be the end of the matter. The manager would avail himself of the opportunity to vent Gallic rage and point out with ruthless logic all the perfectly valid reasons why simians were not admitted. We should then be shown the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Surprisingly, the central issue seemed not to be the admissibility of simians but rather what sort of ticket they required. Bob entered into the spirit of the thing and declared the monkey to be clearly a "minor" and therefore entitled to a reduction. It would not even be occupying a seat. The manager was unwilling to concede the point, fearing perhaps the setting of a precedent. Did he really foresee a stream of people with lions and anteaters, refusing payment on this slim pretext? In the end it was agreed that the monkey would be charged at half the rate of the cheapest seat and that we would sit in the least elegant part of the house. I paid up. The monkey slipped back under the coat and began to snore again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出人意表，重点不在类人猿可否进戏院，而是它该买什么票。巴布迅速掌握精髓，宣称猴子显然是“小孩”，应该免费，它甚至不占座位呢。法国经理不肯让步，唯恐开了不良先例。难道他预见大堆人比照办理，带着狮子、食蚁兽进场，拒绝买票吗？最后，经理同意猴子买最低价座位的半票，但是我们得坐在最不豪华的一区看电影。我付了钱。猴子钻回外套内，继续打呼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first part of the programme was not popular. It consisted of a luridly verbose travelogue about holiday cruises in the West Indies. As usual, there were few barriers between members of the audience and conventions of strict silence were certainly not observed. The gentleman beside me, having removed his boots to ease large splayed feet and unbuttoned his immaculate military uniform to the navel, joked lengthily and repeatedly about my ancestors having given his ancestors free passage on such ships during the slave trade. Bob, a self-aware black American, took such remarks rather ill and a definite atmosphere of tension developed between himself and the military man.</div>

It seemed to become more and more hyperactive. Instead of merely mitigating the oppressive heat, it declared war on it. Jets of icy air belched into the room. A sort of miasmic fog seemed to form beneath the screen as the bland French voice prattled on about "getting away from the cold this winter" on a Caribbean cruise.</div>

Worse yet, the sudden chill penetrated to my simian friend and he poked forth his head to the considerable distress of the lady behind. It was unfortunate that she owned a large, red, shiny handbag. The monkey wanted that handbag desperately and was enraged at the lady's dogged refusal to yield it up. In an attempt to distract the monkey, I bought it a large, red, shiny mango from a passing vendor. Mangoes, however, were strange and unnatural to it.

<div class="line_en">The big story seemed to be a meeting between the President and some unidentifiable Chinese minister dispensing aid. There was the inevitable scene of the President executing a waxy smile into the camera, eyes awkwardly fixed on the lens as he offered the visitor one of the hideous plastic armchairs that always featured in such scenes. "He should use the aid to buy some new furniture," opined the military man in a loud voice. The audience roared, the news erupted into the national anthem, half the spectators rose, the other half made noises. It was all too much for the monkey. Sated with society, he began to gibber and scream. The audience liked that too. The background of the national anthem made our behaviour dangerously close to lèse-majesté.
