<div class="line_en">He carried on, unfazed by her lack of enthusiasm. "I mean, the prices they're charging, you'd think they could be on time. But oh no. Outrageous. I've been waiting here for twenty minutes, and you know when it comes in there won't be a seat to be had. Terrible service."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's outrageous. Scandalous." The stranger had clearly decided that, as reading was out, he would concentrate on the next best thing: complaining. Dylan glanced at him dubiously. She did not really want to get into a discussion with this tweed-covered, middle-aged man and end up being drawn into awkward conversation all the way to Aberdeen. She shrugged, a gesture almost lost under her heavy parka.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太不像话了！真是可耻！”那个陌生人显然已经拿定了主意，既然报纸看不成了，他下面要集中精力做的事就是开始抱怨了。迪伦满心疑虑地瞥了他一眼，她真的不想和这么一位穿着粗呢子衣服的中年人聊什么天，最后在去阿伯丁的漫漫长路上都要被迫参与这种尴尬的谈话。她耸耸肩，在厚实皮大衣的掩盖下这个动作几乎看不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He seemed to take this as an invitation to continue the diatribe. "Better when it was National Rail. Knew where you were with them. Good, honest men working the trains then. It's all gone downhill now. Run by a bunch of charlatans. Outrageous."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那男人大概是把这一声当成请他继续长篇大论的信号了，“还是铁路国营那个时代好啊，那时你知道什么时候上车，那时候车上的工作人员都是诚实本分的好人。现在是越来越糟了，现在管理铁路的都是一小撮吹牛皮的骗子。太不像话了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Where is the train, Dylan thought, desperate to be relieved of this social charade. And there it was, rolling in like a knight in rusting armour. One glimmer of hope in a day full of embarrassment and torment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车现在在哪儿呢？迪伦暗自想，她急不可耐地想从眼前的社交游戏中解脱出来。正在这时，车来了，如同一个身着锈迹斑斑铠甲的骑士呼啸而来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once in the carriage she glanced left and right, trying to identify the crazies -- drunks, weirdos, people who wanted to tell you their life stories (which often involved odd alien abductions) and philosophise with you on the meaning of life and other theories. These people seemed inexplicably drawn to her when she took public transport, and she was anxious to avoid them today when she had so many other things on her mind. Her surveillance picked out the free seats and it did not take long to work out why these remained open in the packed train. A mother with her screaming baby, its red face puckered up and angry, sat at one end with a pram and several bags filled with everything a baby could possibly need scattered in dissaray around them. On the other side of the aisle, a few seats down, there was a double-seater opposite a pair of drunken teenagers in blue Rangers' tops. They were drinking from a bottle of what looked suspiciously like Buckfast hidden inexpertly in a paper bag, and singing loudly and very out of tune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一坐进车厢，迪伦的眼睛就向左右扫了一眼，想看看周围有没有什么不正常的人—酒疯子啊、怪人啊，想把一生的故事都讲给你听的人啊（其中经常涉及被外星人绑架之类的离奇遭遇）以及那些非要和你一起探讨人生意义之类大道理的人。不知为什么，迪伦乘坐公共交通工具时，总能吸引这些人的注意。今天她的心事太多了，所以对他们避之唯恐不及。经过一番仔细观察，她筛选出来好几个空座位。没过多久，她就清楚了为什么在拥挤的列车上这几个座位一直空着。一位母亲带着一个高声哭闹的婴儿坐在一侧，孩子的红脸蛋皱巴巴的，一脸怒容。母子俩周围有一辆婴儿车和若干袋子，里面乱七八糟地摆满了婴儿的必需品。在过道的另一头，隔了几个座位，一对喝得醉醺醺的少年身穿蓝色流浪者队上衣，坐在一个双人空座对面。他们有些外行地把疑似为布克法斯特酒的瓶子藏在一个纸袋子里，大声唱着荒腔走板的曲子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She reached down for the rucksack at her feet. It was faded and showing signs of wear and tear, like most things she owned. As she took both handles in her hand and heaved the heavy bag off the ground and over her shoulder, a faint ripping sound made her grimace. It would be in keeping with the pattern of today for the seam to tear open and a phantom wind to gust up and whisk her underwear across the station. Mercifully it held, and Dylan shuffled forward with the rest of the weary passengers towards the train as it coasted slowly to a standstill. It stopped with a hiss of hydraulics, leaving her equidistant between two sets of doors. She quickly eyed the direction in which the tweed stranger was headed and dashed, as fast as she could under her burden, towards the other door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她伸手取过脚边的帆布背包，像她拥有的大部分物品一样，包已经褪色了，上面到处是磨损的痕迹。她抓住两根把手，把沉甸甸的背包举起来背在肩上，一声轻微的撕裂声不禁让她花容失色。要是背包开缝，再来阵阴风吹过，将她的内衣刮得满车站都是，那今天的倒霉事才真叫成双成对了。不幸之中的万幸，背包挺住了。迪伦等滑行的列车停稳，就拖着步子和其他疲惫不堪的旅客一起走上前。车完全停下来时传来液压装置的嘶嘶声，迪伦刚好站在两扇车门的正中。她快速瞄了一眼那个穿粗呢子大衣的男人往哪扇门跑，然后用尽全力负重朝另一扇门飞奔过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The only other option was in the middle of the carriage, squashed in beside a large woman with an array of shopping bags, which she had arranged on the seat beside and across from her in a manner that made it blatantly clear that she did not welcome company. However, glaring or not, she was the most appealing option.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在唯一的选择位于车厢中部，座位上压着旁边一位大块头女人一大堆购物袋。那女人已经把身旁的对面的座位都占了，摆出一副公然拒绝任何人做伴的架势。但是，不管她会不会瞪眼睛，选择在她这里就座是最有吸引力的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Excuse me," Dylan muttered, shuffling over to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“劳驾。”迪伦小声嘟囔一句，朝女人这边慢慢挪过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The woman sighed loudly, her displeasure obvious, but she moved the bags nonetheless and Dylan, after shrugging out of her jacket and hauling it and her bag up onto the overhead shelf, settled herself down. A quick root around in her bag on the platform, as she waited her turn to enter the train, had produced her MP3 player and some headphones. Sticking them roughly in her ears, she closed her eyes and turned the volume up high, letting the heavy drumbeats of her favourite indie rock band drown out the world around her. She imagined the bag lady glaring at her and her awful music, and the image made her smile. Too quiet for Dylan to hear, the train groaned and strained, picking up speed as it raced on towards Aberdeen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女人高声叹了口气，不满之情溢于言表，但还是把自己的袋子挪开了。迪伦脱掉外套，把它和背包一起放在头顶的架子上，然后坐好。刚才在等着上车的时候，她飞快地翻了一下包，取出了MP3和耳机。现在她把耳机随便往耳朵上一戴，闭目把音量调到最大，让她最喜欢的独立摇滚乐队高亢的鼓点声淹没周围的世界。她能想象得出那位购物袋女士此刻正对她和她可怕的音乐怒目而视，想到这里她露出了微笑。周围安静得听不到一点声音。列车吃力地嘎吱作响，加快速度朝阿伯丁全速前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Keeping her eyes closed, she thought about the coming weekend. Nerves and excitement fought for control of the butterflies in her stomach as she contemplated stepping off the train and searching out the man who was all but a stranger to her. It had taken months of persuasion and wheedling for Joan to relinquish the phone number of one James Miller, her father. Dylan remembered how her hand had shaken as she'd dialled, hung up, dialled again, and then hung up. What if he didn't want to talk to her? What if he had his own family now? What if, worst of all, he turned out to be a huge disappointment? A drunk or a criminal? Her mother had been unable to give her any more details. They didn't talk, ever. He'd left when she'd asked and never bothered either of them again, also like she'd asked. Dylan had been five years old at the time, and in the decade that had passed his face had become less than a memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她紧闭双眼，畅想着即将来临的周末。她想象自己走下火车，搜寻对她来说几乎完全陌生的父亲。她一会儿提心吊胆，一会儿又热血沸腾，胃部也跟着微微抽搐。几个月来她对琼晓之以理，动之以情，好话说尽，终于从她那儿要来了詹姆斯·米勒，也就是她父亲的电话。她先拨号、挂断，再拨号、又挂断，迪伦想起自己当时手抖得有多厉害。要是他不想和自己说话怎么办？要是现在他已经有了自己的家庭怎么办？最糟糕的是，要是他到最后让人非常失望怎么办？要是他是个酒鬼或是个罪犯呢？母亲没有给出更多关于他的细节，她们从不曾讨论过他。母亲要他离开，他就离开了，而且就像她要求的那样，从此再也没有打扰过她们母女。迪伦当时才只有五岁，十年过去了，父亲的相貌在她的记忆里已经很模糊了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After two days of inner turmoil, Dylan had called in the middle of the day, finding a quiet spot in the school playground that wasn't already claimed by the smokers, amorous couples or gangs. Her hope was that he'd be at work and no one would answer. It worked. After six heart-stopping rings, the answer machine beeped and she suddenly realised that she hadn't thought about what she was going to say. Panicking, she left a hesitant, rambling message.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内心挣扎了两天后，迪伦终于在中午时分给他打了电话。打电话的地点选在学校操场一个僻静的地方，这里还没有被烟民、爱侣和流氓帮派霸占。她希望他此时正在工作或是无人接听，她如愿了。电话响了六声，每一声都几乎让她的心脏停跳，直到留言机发出嘟嘟的提示音。她突然意识到，自己根本没想好要说些什么。心慌意乱的她吞吞吐吐地说了几句不着边际的话—">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as she'd hung up, she'd cringed. What an idiot! She couldn't believe that she hadn't planned a message. She'd sounded like a bumbling moron. Well, there was nothing to do now but wait. And she had waited. All afternoon she felt sick to her stomach. Biology and English passed in a blur. At home she'd numbly watched Ready, Steady, Cook and the news, not even changing channel when the stupid soaps came on. What if he didn't call? Would he have listened to the message yet? What if he never got the message? Dylan had imagined a female hand lifting the receiver and listening, then slowly pressing a painted red fingernail on the delete button. The image had made her look over at the cordless phone beside her and chew her bottom lip, indecisively. Too scared to phone again, she'd had no choice but to cross her fingers and stay within easy reach of her mobile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚一放下电话，她立刻又畏缩了。简直就是个白痴！她简直不敢相信自己事先竟连说什么都没想好，刚才的声音听起来像笨手笨脚的傻瓜。好了，现在除了等待没事可做了。整个下午她都感到胃不舒服，生物课和英文课稀里糊涂就上过去了。回到家，她木然地看着BBC二台的《厨王争霸》和新闻节目，甚至当愚不可及的肥皂剧开始时也没有换频道。他要是不回电怎么办呢？他有没有听到电话留言呢？他要是一直没有收到留言怎么办？迪伦仿佛看到一个女人的手拿起了电话听筒，听到留言后，缓缓地用涂得鲜红的指甲按了删除键。她只好两指交叉祈求好运，把手机一直放在伸手可及的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took two days, but he did call. At four o'clock, just as she was sloshing home through yet another rainy day of school with wet socks and increasingly wet shoulders, her phone vibrated in her pocket and began chirping out the piano chords of the Once Upon a Time theme tune. This was it. Her heart seemed to stop beating as she yanked the phone out of her pocket. A quick glance at the caller ID confirmed it: although it wasn't a number she recognised, it was the Aberdeen area code. Sliding her thumb up the glass screen, she pressed it to her ear.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been so easy after that. Talking to him felt very comfortable, like she'd known him for ever. They'd talked until Dylan's mobile ran out of charge. He wanted to know everything about her, her school, hobbies, who she hung out with, what movies were her favourites and what books she liked to read. Boys -- though there wasn't much to say there, not from the selection on offer at Kaithshall. In return, he told her about his life in Aberdeen, where he lived with Anna, his dog. No wife, no kids. No complications. And he wanted her to visit.</div>

<div class="line_en">That had been exactly one week ago. For seven days Dylan had been wrestling with her nerves and excitement about meeting him, and trying not to fight with Joan, who made no secret of the fact that she disapproved of Dylan trying to connect with her father. She'd no one to talk to about it except snatched MSN conversations with Katie whenever her friend's crazy mother gave her five minutes alone. They'd managed to sneak one such chat last night. Katie's mother had done a late-night shopping run -- she hated to go when there would be lots of people around -- and Katie had managed to convince her that she needed to go to bed early for school. Dylan had received her text and two minutes later they'd been connected.</div>
