<div class="line_en">Each year he sent her roses, and the note would always say, "I love you even more this year, than last year on this day." "My love for you will always grow, with every passing year." She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear. She thought, he ordered roses in advance before this day. Her loving husband did not know that he would pass away. He always liked to do things early. Then, if he got too busy, everything would work out fine. She trimmed the stems, and placed them in a very special vase. Then, sat the vase beside the portrait of his smiling face. She would sit for hours, in her husband's favorite chair. While staring at his picture, and the roses sitting there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Red roses were her favorites, her name was also Rose. And every year her husband sent them, tied with pretty bows. The year he died, the roses were delivered to her door. The card said, "Be my Valentine", like all the years before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="红玫瑰是她的最爱，玫瑰也是她的名字。每年她的丈夫都要送红玫瑰给她，上面系着漂亮的蝴蝶结。他去世的那年，玫瑰花送到了她家门口。卡片上写着“我的情人节礼物”，就同前几年一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A year went by, and it was hard to live without her mate. With loneliness and solitude, that had become her fate. Then, the very hour, as on Valentines before, the doorbell rang, and there were roses, sitting by her door. She brought the roses in, and then just looked at them in shock. Then, went to get the telephone, to call the florist shop. The owner answered, and she asked him, if he would explain, why would someone do this to her, causing her such pain?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年过去了，没有他的日子很艰难。孤独和寂寞成了她的命运。然而，在情人节这天，跟以往送花的时间相同，门铃响了，玫瑰花就放在门前。她将玫瑰花拿进屋，吃惊地看着它们。然后她拨通了花店的电话。她问店主能否向她解释一下，为什么有人要对她做这件事，引起她的痛苦和心酸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She thanked him and hung up the phone, her tears now flowing hard. Her fingers shaking, as she slowly reached to get the card. Inside the card, she saw that he had written her a note. Then, as she stared in total silence, this is what he wrote: "Hello my love, I know it's been a year since I've been gone, I hope it hasn't been too hard for you to overcome." "I know it must be lonely, and the pain is very real. For if it was the other way, I know how I would feel. The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life. I loved you more than words can say, you were the perfect wife."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她谢了他，挂了电话，眼泪夺眶而出。她的手指颤抖着，慢慢地伸手去拿那张卡片。在卡片上，她看到他写给她的便条。她默默地看着，他是这样写的：“亲爱的，我知道我离开你已经一年了，我希望你所度过的这段日子不是太难。我知道你一定很孤独，一定苦不堪言。因为如果这样的事发生在我身上，我知道我会有怎样的感受。我们的爱让生命中的一切都那么美丽。我对你的爱无法用言语表达，你是最完美的妻子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
