<div class="line_en">Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he thought. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go deep to die. He tired to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he though. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The current will have set us far to the eastward, he thought. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he was tiring. When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring. There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might. "God let him jump," the old man said. "I have enough line to handle him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，浪潮将会把我们冲向远远的东方，我真希望它能够随着水流转向，因为这样便表示它已经渐渐疲累了。太阳升得更高，老人明白这条鱼并没有疲累。但是只有一个有利的信号，那就是线绳的倾斜度，可以显示出它所游的深度变浅了。但是这并不一定表示它要跳了，不过也是有这种可能性呀。「上帝啊！让它跳吧！」老人说：「我有足够的线应付它。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it. There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night. "Fish," he said. "I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends." Let us hope so, he thought. A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very low over the water. The old man could see that he was very tired.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，反正太阳出来了以后，我就感觉舒服多了，至少我不必一直盯着它。线绳上黏着黄色的海草，但老人晓得那只会增加鱼的负担而已，所以一点也不介意，反而很高兴。那是墨西哥湾区的一种黄色海草，晚上时会发出磷光。「鱼啊！」他说：「我爱你，而且如此地景仰你。但是，在今天结束之前，我将会杀了你。」他想，但愿如此。一只小鸟从北方朝向船边飞了过来，那是一只莺，低低地飞在水面上。老人看得出来它已经很疲累了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man's head and rested on the line where he was more comfortable. "How old are you?" the old man asked the bird. "Is this your first trip?" The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast. "It's steady," the old man told him. "It's too steady. You shouldn't be that tired after a windless night. What are birds coming to?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟儿飞向船尾，在那儿歇息。然后它在老人头上盘旋，最后停在让它感到较舒服的鱼在线。「你几岁了？」老人问小鸟。「这是不是你头一次出远门？」鸟儿望着说话的老人。它已疲倦得没有精神去检查线绳，就用它那纤弱的小爪子紧紧地抓住线绳，在上面晃来晃去。「今天天气很稳定。」老人告诉它。「真得很稳定啊。经过这样一个无风的夜晚，你应该不致于这么疲倦啊，你们鸟儿都在做什么呢？」">查看中文翻译</div>
