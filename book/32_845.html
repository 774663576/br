<div class="line_en">Kiss me damn it! I implore him, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with a strange, unfamiliar need, completely captivated by him. I'm staring at Christian Grey's exquisitely sculptured mouth, mesmerized, and he's looking down at me, his gaze hooded, his eyes darkening. He's breathing harder than usual, and I've stopped breathing altogether. I'm in your arms. Kiss me, please. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and gives me a small shake of his head as if in answer to my silent question. When he opens his eyes again, it's with some new purpose, a steely resolve.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Anastasia, you should steer clear of me. I'm not the man for you," he whispers. What? Where is this coming from? Surely I should be the judge of that. I frown up at him, and my head swims with rejection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“安娜塔希娅，你最好避开我，我不是适合你的男人。”他轻声说。什么？这句话是哪里冒出来的？我才应该是下判断的人吧。我不解地抬头看他，脑海里只能想到自己被拒绝了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Adrenaline has spiked through my body, from the near miss with the cyclist or the heady proximity to Christian, leaving me wired and weak. NO! My psyche screams as he pulls away, leaving me bereft. He has his hands on my shoulders, holding me at arm's length, watching my reactions carefully. And the only thing I can think is that I wanted to be kissed, made it pretty damned obvious, and he didn't do it. He doesn't want me. He really doesn't want me. I have royally screwed up the coffee morning.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是那个白痴逆向行驶。还好我也在，一想到你可能会发生意外就让我毛骨悚然。你要不要到酒店里来坐一会儿？”他松开我，双手放在身侧。我直挺挺地站在他面前，觉得自己像个傻瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a shake, I clear my head. I just want to go. All my vague, unarticulated hopes have been dashed. He doesn't want me. What was I thinking? I scold myself. What would Christian Grey want with you? My subconscious mocks me. I wrap my arms around myself and turn to face the road and note with relief that the green man has appeared. I quickly make my way across, conscious that Grey is behind me. Outside the hotel, I turn briefly to face him but cannot look him in the eye.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“安娜塔希娅，我…”他顿了一下，声音里的痛苦引起了我的注意。我不情愿地抬眼看他。他伸手爬梳过头发，眼眸里带着些许悲伤。他似乎受了打击，神情失落。精心维持的自制全都化为乌有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once underneath the dark, cold concrete of the garage with its bleak fluorescent light, I lean against the wall and put my head in my hands. What was I thinking? Unbidden and unwelcome tears pool in my eyes. Why am I crying? I sink to the ground, angry at myself for this senseless reaction. Drawing up my knees, I fold in on myself. I want to make myself as small as possible. Perhaps this nonsensical pain will be smaller, the smaller I am. Placing my head on my knees, I let the irrational tears fall unrestrained. I am crying over the loss of something I never had. How ridiculous. Mourning something that never was -- my dashed hopes, dashed dreams, and my soured expectations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走入那由水泥打造、黑暗冰冷的停车场；惨淡苍白的日光灯在头顶闪烁，我双手抱头靠在墙边。我在想什么啊？不请自来的泪水满溢眼中。为什么要哭？我跌坐在地上，为了这愚蠢的反应生自己的气。我屈起双膝用手抱住，想让自己缩得越小越好，也许我变小了，这莫名其妙的痛苦也会跟着减少。将头抵着膝盖，我任由荒唐的泪水恣意奔流。我因为失去了自己从未拥有的东西而伤心，真是荒谬。我为了某些从来不属于我的东西畏悼：我那消失的希望、梦想，还有错误的期盼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thanks." I can't disguise the sarcasm in my voice. "Goodbye, Mr. Grey." I turn on my heel, vaguely amazed that I don't trip, and without giving him a second glance, I disappear down the sidewalk toward the underground garage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢。”我无法掩饰声音中的挖苦。“再见。格雷先生。”我举步离开。微微惊讶自己竟然没有绊到脚。不再看他一眼，我往地下停车场走去，消失在人行道尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stop! Stop Now! -- My subconscious is metaphorically screaming at me, arms folded, leaning on one leg and tapping her foot in frustration. Get in the car, go home, do your studying. Forget about him… Now! And stop all this self-pitying, wallowing crap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="停止！现在就停止！我的潜意识象征性地对我大吼，双手抱胸斜斜地站着，一脚失望地在地上轻点。进车里去，回家吧。好好念书，把他忘了…立刻！不要再自怨自艾了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Romantically, though, I've never put myself out there, ever. A lifetime of insecurity -- I'm too pale, too skinny, too scruffy, uncoordinated, my long list of faults goes on. So I have always been the one to rebuff any would-be admirers. There was that guy in my chemistry class who liked me, but no one has ever sparked my interest -- no one except Christian damn Grey. Maybe I should be kinder to the likes of Paul Clayton and José Rodriguez, though I'm sure neither of them has been found sobbing alone in dark places. Perhaps I just need a good cry.</div>

Okay… so I was always one of the last to be picked for basketball or volleyball -- but I understood that -- running and doing something else at the same time like bouncing or throwing a ball is not my thing. I am a serious liability in any sporting field.</div>

He'd said it there and then. He didn't want me as a girlfriend. I turn on to my side. Idly, I wonder if perhaps he's celibate. I close my eyes and begin to drift. Maybe he's saving himself.

<div class="line_en">"If you're going to throw up again, do it here. I'll hold you." He has one arm around my shoulders -- the other is holding my hair in a makeshift ponytail down my back so it's off my face. I try awkwardly to push him away, but I vomit again… and again. Oh shit… how long is this going to last? Even when my stomach's empty and nothing is coming up, horrible dry heaves wrack my body. I vow silently that I'll never ever drink again. This is just too appalling for words. Finally, it stops.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你还想吐，吐在这里吧，我会扶着你的。”他一手环着我的肩，另一手像绑马尾般抓着我的头发。避免发丝挡着我的脸。我笨拙地试图推开他。但又开始吐了！！吐个不停。可恶…还要吐多久啊？我的胃都空了。再也吐不出东西，讨厌的干呕让我全身无力。我默默在心里发誓永远不会再喝酒了，这种痛苦实在无法用言语表达。终于，我停止呕吐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My hands are resting on the brick wall of the flowerbed, barely holding me up. Vomiting profusely is exhausting. Grey takes his hands off me and passes me a handkerchief. Only he would have a monogrammed, freshly laundered linen handkerchief. CTG. I didn't know you could still buy these. Vaguely I wonder what the T stands for as I wipe my mouth. I cannot bring myself to look at him. I'm swamped with shame, disgusted with myself. I want to be swallowed up by the azaleas in the flowerbed and be anywhere but here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我双手扶着花台边的砖石，勉强稳住自己，这样大吐特吐实在很伤元气。格雷放开了我，递给我一条手帕，只有他会用这种绣着姓氏、洗熨得干干净净的亚麻手帕。上面绣着CTG。我不知道现在还买得到这种手帕。我擦着嘴，对T字代表什么隐约感到好奇。我不敢正面直视他，觉得自己念心死了，而且丢脸到家。我希望可以一头栽进花台里的杜鹃花丛去，让我到世界上的任何一个角落都好。就是别留在这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">José is still hovering by the entrance to the bar, watching us. I groan and put my head in my hands. This has to be the single worst moment of my life. My head is still swimming as I try to remember a worse one -- and I can only come up with Christian's rejection -- and this is so, so many shades darker in terms of humiliation. I risk a peek at him. He's staring down at me, his face composed, giving nothing away. Turning, I glance at José who looks pretty shamefaced himself and, like me, intimidated by Grey. I glare at him. I have a few choice words for my so-called friend, none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey CEO. Ana, who are you kidding? He's just seen you hurl all over the ground and into the local flora. There's no disguising your lack of ladylike behavior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="荷西还在酒吧门口徘徊看着我们。我低吟，用双手捣着脸，这绝对是我人生中最糟糕的一刻。虽然我的头还是很晕，但我还是试着想还有没有更惨的事——我只能想到被克里斯钦拒绝，那比丢人现眼更加不堪。我偷偷抬眼瞧他。他也正低头看我，表情镇定如常，什么也看不出来。转过头。我瞄到荷西一脸愧疚，也和我一样被格雷突然的出现吓到了。我看着他，有几句斟酌过的话想要告诉我那所谓的好朋友，但没有一句能够在克里斯钦·格雷总裁的面前说。安娜，你想骗谁？他才刚亲眼看过你疯狂地对着地面和花台大吐特吐，你这种毫不淑女的行为是瞒不了人的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Apart from a silly drunk girl ringing him in the middle of the night so he thinks she needs rescuing. And it turns out she does from her over-amorous friend. Then seeing her being violently ill at his feet. Oh Ana… are you ever going to live this down? My subconscious is figuratively tutting and glaring at me over her half-moon specs. I sway slightly, and he puts his hand on my shoulder to steady me. I do as I'm told and drink the entire glass. It makes me feel queasy. Taking the glass from me, he places it on the bar. I notice through a blur what he's wearing: a loose white linen shirt, snug jeans, black Converse sneakers, and a dark pinstriped jacket.

Maybe it's because I'm drunk that I can keep up. He's holding me tight against him, his body against mine… if he wasn't clutching me so tightly, I'm sure I would swoon at his feet.
