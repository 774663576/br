<div class="line_en">The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She wondered, with little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure," said she. "I could see it in his face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can it be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know the truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her. May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a notion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over. His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我敢肯定，准是出了什么伤心事儿，”她说，“我从上校脸上看得出来。可怜的人儿！恐怕他的境况不佳呀。算计起来，德拉福庄园的年收入从来没有超过两千镑，他的弟弟把事情搞得一塌糊涂。我看哪，八成是为钱的事情找他，不然还会有什么事儿呢？我在纳闷是不是这么回事儿。我无论如何也要弄个水落石出。也许是为威廉斯小姐的事儿——这么说来，肯定是为她的事儿，因为我当初提到她的时候，上校看上去很不自然。也许她在城里生病了，十有八九是这么回事儿，因为我觉得她总是多灾多病的。我敢打赌，就是为威廉斯小姐的事儿。现在看来，上校不大可能陷入经济困难，因为他是个精明人，时至今日，庄园的开支肯定早就结清了。我真不知道是怎么回事儿！也许他在阿维尼翁的妹妹病情恶化了，叫他快去。他走得匆匆忙忙的，看样子很像。唉，我衷心祝愿他摆脱困境，还能讨个好太太。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich. His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺不难看出，他们还不能马上结婚，因为威洛比虽说在经济上是独立的，但并不能认为他很有钱。按照约翰爵士的估计，他庄园上的收入一年只有五六百镑闻于齐，人称贤师。，但他花费太大，那笔收入简直不够用，他自己也经常在哭穷。但是，使她感到莫名其妙的是，他们订了婚，竟对她保守秘密，其实他们什么也包不住。这与他们的惯常想法和做法太不一致了，以致使她有时候也怀疑，他们是不是真的订了婚。因为有这个怀疑，她也就不便去探问玛丽安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose. Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of. It was engossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹宁斯太太就这么疑疑惑惑唠唠叨叨。她的看法变来变去，一会儿一个猜测，而且开头总是满有把握。埃丽诺虽然着实关心布兰登上校的安乐，但是她不能像詹宁斯太太所企望于她的，对他的突然离去惊诧不已，妄加猜疑。因为在她看来，情况没有那么严重，犯不着那样惊疑。除此之外，还有真正使她感到惊奇的事，那就是她妹妹和威洛比，他们明明知道他们的事情引起了大家的特别兴趣，却异乎寻常地保持缄默。他们一天天地越是不吭声，事情越显得奇怪，越与他们两人的性情不相协调。从他们的一贯行为看，本来是昭然若揭的事情，却不敢向母亲和她公开承认，埃丽诺无法想象这究竟是什么缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What!" he exclaimed --"Improve this dear cottage! No. That I will never consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch to its size, if my feelings are regarded."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么！”他惊叫道。“改建这座可爱的乡舍。不——不，这我决不会同意，你若是尊重我的意见的话，务必不要增添一砖一石，扩大一寸一分。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰登上校离开乡下一周后的一天傍晚，威洛比似乎对周围的事物产生了一股异乎寻常的亲切感。达什伍德太太无意中提起了要在来年春天改建乡舍的计划，当即遭到了他的激烈反对，因为他已经与这里建立了感情，觉得一切都十全十美。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his favourite pointer at her feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威洛比的行为最明显地表达了他对达什伍德母女的一片深情。他作为玛丽安的情人，真是要多温柔有多温柔；而对于其他人，他作为女婿、姐夫和妹夫，也能殷勤备至。他似乎把乡舍当成了自己的家，迷恋不舍，他泡在这里的时间比呆在艾伦汉的时间还要多。倘若巴顿庄园没有大的聚会的话，他早晨就出来活动活动，而最后几乎总是来到乡舍，他自己守在玛丽安身旁，他的爱犬趴在玛丽安脚边，消磨掉这一整天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with all and every thing belonging to it; -- in no one convenience or INconvenience about it, should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”威洛比以同样急切的语气大声说道，“一切的一切都要一模一样。无论是便利的设施，还是不便利的设施，都不能看出一丝一毫的不同。到那时，只有到那时，我在库姆住进这样一座房子，或许会像在巴顿一样快活。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am," said he. "To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”威洛比说，“我觉得它是完美无缺的。唔，更进一步说，我认为它是可以让人获得幸福的唯一的建筑形式。我若是有钱的话，马上就把库姆大厦推倒，按照这座乡舍的图样重新建造。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，威洛比。你尽管放心，我不会伤害你的或是我所喜爱的任何人的一丝一毫的乡土感情，而去搞什么改建。你相信我好啦，到了春天结帐时，不管剩下多少钱没派用场，我宁肯撂下不用，也不拿来干些让你如此伤心的事情。不过，你当真这么喜爱这个地方，觉得它毫无缺陷？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby, "which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of my affection, which no other can possibly share."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，”威洛比说，“有些情况会使我非常喜爱我自己的房子；不过这个地方将永远让我留恋不舍，这是别的地方无法比拟的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it. How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account for. Must it not have been so, Marianne?" speaking to her in a lowered voice. Then continuing his former tone, he said, "And yet this house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一年前来艾伦汉的时候，”威洛比接着说，“经常在想，但愿巴顿乡舍能住上人家：每当我从它跟前经过，总要对它的位置叹羡不已，同时也对它无人居住而感到痛惜。我万万没有料到，我再次来到乡下时，从史密斯太太嘴里听到的头一条新闻，就是巴顿乡舍住上人了！顿时，我对这事既满意，又有兴趣。我之所以有这种感觉，那是因为我预感到，我将从中获得幸福。玛丽安，难道事实不正是如此吗？”他压低声音对她说。接着又恢复了原先的语调，说道：“不过，你要损坏这座房子的，达什伍德太太！你想用异想天开的改建，毁掉它的简朴自然：就在这间可爱的客厅里，我们初次结识，以后又在一起度过了许许多多快乐的时刻，没想到你要把它贬黜成一道普普通通的门廊。可是大家还是渴望要进那间客厅，因为它迄今为止一直是个既实用又舒适的房间，天下再气派的房间也比它不上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I flatter myself," replied Elinor, "that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“依我看呀，”埃丽诺答道，“你今后即使不巧住上更好的房间，用上更宽的楼梯，你会觉得你自己的房子是完美无瑕的，就像你现在觉得这座乡舍是完美无瑕的一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
