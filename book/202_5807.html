<div class="line_en">He was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利又闭上了眼睛，思索着他看到的情景。食死徒刚才聚集在似乎摔倒的伏地魔身边。伏地魔用杀戮咒击中哈利的同时一定发生了什么事。难道伏地魔也晕了过去？看来是这样。他俩都昏迷了很短的时间，现在又都苏醒过来……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and felt his heart.

<div class="line_cn" title="一双手，一双哈利没想到会是这么柔软的手，摸了摸哈利的脸，翻开他的眼皮，又伸进衬衫下面探摸他的胸口，试了试他的心跳。哈利可以听见女人急促的呼吸声，感到她的长发拂在脸上痒痒的。他知道女人能感觉到他的生命一下下撞击着他的肋骨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry did not know who had been sent to verify.

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不知道伏地魔派谁来核实。他只能躺在那里等待接受检查，心脏不听话地怦怦狂跳，不过他同时注意到——虽然这并不能给他带来多少安慰——伏地魔不敢贸然接近他，伏地魔怀疑计划出了差错……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利早就知道会有这一着，知道伏地魔不会让他清清爽爽地躺在密林的地上，必要百般羞辱他以证明自己的胜利。哈利的身体被升到了半空，他用全部的毅力让自己保持软弱无力的样子，他以为会很痛，然而并没有。他被一次、两次、三次抛向空中，眼镜掉了，他感到长袍底下的魔杖滑到了一边，但他一直让自己显得软绵绵的毫无生气。他最后一次落到地上时，空地上响彻着讥诮声和狂笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Move," said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快走。”伏地魔说。海格跌跌撞撞地往前走，在茂密的树丛间穿行着离开了禁林。树枝钩着哈利的头发和长袍，他一动不动地躺着，嘴巴无力地张着，眼睛闭得紧紧的。黑暗中，食死徒们聚集在周围，海格闭着眼睛大声哭泣，谁也没有仔细看看哈利·波特露在外面的脖颈上是否有脉搏在跳动……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人把哈利的眼镜杵到他的脸上，动作故意很粗暴，可是把他托到空中的那双大手却格外温柔。在海格摇篮一样的怀抱里，哈利可以感觉到海格剧烈啜泣时双臂在颤抖，大颗大颗的泪珠溅在他身上，哈利不敢用动作或语言向海格表示一切并没有结束。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's stag kept guardian in his heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利猜想海格肯定是被迫服从了伏地魔的命令，因为他的身子打了个趔趄。一股寒意笼罩了，哈利听见了在森林外围巡逻的摄魂怪们刺耳的呼吸声。它们再也不能拿他怎么样了。他还活着的事实如一团火在他心头燃烧，是一个辟邪的法宝，似乎父亲的牡鹿一直在他心中守护着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个巨人磕磕碰碰地走在食死徒身后面，哈利可以听见他们走过时树林吱吱嘎嘎地断裂和倒地的声音。他们发出的声音太大了，鸟儿尖叫着飞向空中，就连食死徒们的讥笑声也被淹没了。胜利的队伍继续朝空旷的操场前进，过了一会儿，哈利透过紧闭的眼皮感到黑暗逐渐变亮了，知道树木开始变得稀疏了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格说不下去了，又伤心地哭了起来。哈利不知道有多少马人在观看他们这支队伍，他不敢睁开眼睛。有几个食死徒在大声辱骂身后的马人。又过了片刻，哈利感到空气变得新鲜了，知道已经到了禁林边缘。">查看中文翻译</div>

Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage.

<div class="line_en">The Death Eaters came to a halt: Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="食死徒们都停住了。哈利听见他们面对学校敞开的大门一字散开。他虽然闭着眼睛，也能隐约感觉到红光，那一定是门厅里透出的灯光。他等待着。那些他曾经为他们赴死的人，随时都会看见他如同死了一样躺在海格的怀里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves.

<div class="line_en">But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是伏地魔没能把话说完，哈利听见了扭打声、喊叫声，接着又是砰的一声，一道闪光，痛苦的哼哼。他把眼睛睁开一点点缝隙。原来有人挣脱人群朝伏地魔冲了过来。哈利看见那个人影被解除了武器，重重地倒在地上，伏地魔哈哈大笑地把挑战者的魔杖扔到一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, yes, I remember," said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and uNPRotected, standing in the no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters.

<div class="line_en">Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仍然隔着眼睫毛，哈利看见伏地魔挥了一下魔杖。几秒钟后，从城堡被砸烂的一扇窗户里飞出一个怪鸟般的东西。它从昏暗的光线中飞来，落在伏地魔手里。伏地魔抓住这个发霉物件的尖头抖了抖，它便空荡荡、烂糟糟地耷拉下来：是分院帽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled, "HAGGER!" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们听见远处学校界墙那儿传来了骚动，似乎千百个人浩浩荡荡地翻过视线外的围墙，高声呐喊着朝城堡冲来。与此同时，格洛普摇摇摆摆地从城堡一侧拐了过来，嘴里喊道：“海格！”伏地魔的那些巨人吼叫着发出回应。他们像雄象一样冲向格洛普，震得大地发抖。接着是马蹄声，拉弓声，转眼间，利箭纷纷射向食死徒中间。他们吃惊地大叫，乱了阵脚。哈利从长袍里抽出隐形衣披在身上，腾地从地上跃起，这时纳威也能动了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.</div>

They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges.</div>

Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一瞬间令人战栗的寂静，人们惊恐地怔住了。随即，哈利周围爆发出排山倒海般的喧哗，喊叫声、欢呼声、咆哮声震天动地。初升太阳的强烈光芒照在窗户上，人们喊叫着向他扑来，首先赶到的是罗恩和赫敏，他们的胳膊把他紧紧地抱住了，他们不知所云的叫嚷几乎把他的耳朵震聋了。接着，金妮、纳威和卢娜也来了，还有韦斯莱一家和海格、金斯莱、麦格、弗立维和斯普劳特。每个人都在大喊，哈利一个字也听不清，也分不出是谁的手在拽他、拉他，拼命想拥抱到他身体的一部分。几百个人在往前挤，谁都想摸摸这位大难不死的男孩，正是因为他，噩梦才终于结束了——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They moved Voldemort's body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother's shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好了，他可以不受打扰地在礼堂里走动了。他看见金妮和他隔着两个桌子，坐在那里，脑袋靠在她母亲的肩膀上。以后有的是时间跟她说话，说许多个小时、许多天、甚至许多年。他看见纳威在吃东西，盘子旁边放着格兰芬多的宝剑，周围是一群狂热的崇拜者。哈利走在桌子之间的通道里，看见马尔福一家三口搂作一团，似乎不知道他们是不是应该待在那里，但没有一个人注意他们。哈利看见到处都是家人团聚的场面。终于，他看见了他最渴望在一起的两个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.</div>
