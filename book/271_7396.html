<div class="line_en">Edward was still apologizing, and I didn't think that was either fair or appropriate. After all, Edward hadn't completely and inexcusably lost control of his temper. Edward hadn't tried to rip Jacob's head off -- Jacob, who wouldn't even phase to protect himself -- and then accidentally broken Seth's shoulder and collarbone when he jumped in between. Edward hadn't almost killed his best friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华一直不停的道歉着，但我觉得根本没必要而且还很不公平。不管怎么说，完全失控的那个人并不是爱德华，他也没有想过要去把雅各布的头给拎下来。再说，雅各布一开始就没想过保护自己——反而是Seth跳到我们中间的时候让他意外把自己的肩膀和锁骨都撞断了。几乎杀了自己好兄弟的那个又不是爱德华。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It only made it worse that Edward was having a difficult time keeping the smile off his face. I knew that Jacob didn't deserve my overreaction, but Edward seemed to find something satisfying in it.

<div class="line_en">I buried my face in my hands and shuddered at the thought, at the very real possibility. It could have happened so easily. And werewolves didn't react to vampire venom the same way humans did, they'd told me only now. It was poison to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Seth seemed to feel no aversion to having me sit beside him on the sofa as Carlisle treated him. "I'll be back to normal in half an hour," he continued, still patting my knee as if oblivious to the cold, hard texture of it.

<div class="line_en">"Well, Seth," Carlisle said, straightening up and stepping away from us. "I think that's as much as I can do. Try to not move for, oh, a few hours, I guess." Carlisle chuckled. "I wish treating humans were this instantaneously gratifying." He rested his hand for a moment on Seth's black hair. "Stay still," he ordered, and then he disappeared upstairs. I heard his office door close, and I wondered if they'd already removed the evidence of my time there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那，塞思，”卡莱尔站起身说，“我能做的只有这么多了。这段时间尽量不要动，呃，可能只有几个小时，我猜。”他自我娱乐了一下：“如果给人类治病的时候也能这么快、这么爽就好了。”卡莱尔摸了摸塞思的头加了句：“别乱动。”话还没完人就消失在楼梯上。我可以听见最后一个字从楼上飘来，我想他们可能已经把我在那里痛苦的证明都消灭得一干二净了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can probably manage sitting still for a while," Seth agreed after Carlisle was already gone, and then he yawned hugely. Carefully, making sure not to tweak his shoulder, Seth leaned his head against the sofa's back and closed his eyes. Seconds later, his mouth fell slack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想我还是乖乖的待在这里吧。”塞思打了个大大的呵欠，同意道。尽量不去碰到手臂，小心翼翼的躺在沙发上闭上眼睛。不到一会，就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could hear Jacob and Rosalie outside on the front steps bickering quietly over whose turn it was to feed Renesmee. Their relationship was as antagonistic as ever; the only thing they agreed on now was that I should be kept away from my baby until I was one hundred percent recovered from my temper tantrum. Edward had disputed their verdict, but I'd let it go. I wanted to be sure, too. I was worried, though, that my one hundred percent sure and their one hundred percent sure might be very different things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也能听见屋外雅各布和罗莎莉为了谁来喂蕾妮斯梅这种问题无声的争吵。他们之间的关系还是不太好，但唯一有件他事们都同意那就是，在我能百分一百肯定自己从暴躁中冷静下来以前，最好离蕾妮斯梅远一点。爱德华为此和他们吵了一架，但我没有再反对。我也不想有一丝一毫的疏忽，不过我担心，我的百分之百确定和他们的标准可能有点不一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leah was pacing along the river, stopping every now and then to look at the house. It was easy to tell when she was looking for her brother and when she was looking for me. She alternated between anxious glances and murderous glares.</div>

<div class="line_en">I frowned at his peaceful face for another minute. Like Jacob, Seth seemed to have the gift of falling asleep at will. Knowing I wouldn't be able to apologize again for a while, I got up; the motion didn't jostle the couch in the slightest. Everything physical was so easy. But the rest…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我皱着眉头看着他宁静的脸，跟雅各布一样，塞思似乎也拥有那种想睡就能睡着的天赋。知道自己不可能很快开口道歉，干脆走上楼，途中一点响声都没发出。只要是运动上的事都很简单，但剩下的……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Binding, because the most absolute of all the pack's laws was that no wolf ever kill the object of another wolf's imprinting. The pain of such a thing would be intolerable for the whole pack. The fault, whether intended or accidental, could not be forgiven; the wolves involved would fight to the death -- there was no other option. It had happened long ago, Seth told me, but only accidentally. No wolf would ever intentionally destroy a brother that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关系紧密，是因为在狼群中最重要的一条原则就是绝对禁止狼人杀害其他同伴的烙印之人。失去这个人的悲痛会让整个狼群都痛苦不堪。这罪过，无论是无心之失还是有意之为，都不可原谅。所有被牵连的狼人都会战斗至死——没有其他解决的途径了。很久以前曾发生过这样的事，Seth告诉我，但那也只是一次意外，没有一个狼人会用这样的方式去毁灭自己的兄弟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other than their squabbling, Seth's slow breathing, and Leah's annoyed panting, it was very quiet. Emmett, Alice, and Esme were hunting. Jasper had stayed behind to watch me. He stood unobtrusively behind the newel post now, trying not to be obnoxious about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I deliberately redirected my thoughts in order to control my emotions. I considered another interesting phenomenon; though the silence between the separate packs continued, Jacob and Sam had discovered that Alphas could speak to each other while in their wolf form. It wasn't the same as before; they couldn't hear every thought the way they had prior to the split. It was more like speaking aloud, Seth had said. Sam could only hear the thoughts Jacob wanted to share, and vice versa. They found they could communicate over distance, too, now that they were talking to each other again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了控制自己的情绪，我还是慎重的改变了话题，转而想着另一个有趣的事，那就是首领们可以单对单的谈话当他们以狼人的形态存在的时候。这不是像原来无法控制的听见对方所有的想法那样，而是更像大声说话，塞思这么说。山姆只能听见雅各布想让他知道的事，与之相反，他们还能远距离交流，现在，他们重新和好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Renesmee was untouchable because of the way Jacob now felt about her. I tried to concentrate on the relief of this fact rather than the chagrin, but it wasn't easy. My mind had enough room to feel both emotions intensely at the same time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以现在蕾妮斯梅是不可杀之人了，因为雅各布对她的感觉。我让自己把注意力集中到除了懊恼之外的事上，虽然很困难——我现在的脑袋能毫不费力的同时思考这两件事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Sam couldn't get mad about my transformation, either, because Jacob -- speaking as the rightful Alpha -- had allowed it. It rankled to realize over and over again how much I owed Jacob when I just wanted to be mad at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且山姆也不能因我的转变而攻击，因为雅各布——作为正统的首领——已经同意了这件事。这让我不能自已的一遍又一遍的责怪自己：我欠他的如此之多居然还攻击他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sighed as soon as reality filtered through hope. I couldn't see Charlie right away. The eyes, the voice, the perfected face. What could I possibly say to him; how could I even begin? I was furtively glad that I had some excuses for putting things off for a while; as much as I wanted to find some way to keep Charlie in my life, I was terrified of that first meeting. Seeing his eyes pop as he took in my new face, my new skin. Knowing that he was frightened. Wondering what dark explanation would form in his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当真实超过幻想，我深深叹了口气。我现在还不能去看查理，我的眼睛，我的声音，我完美的面容。我能跟他说什么，我甚至不知如何开口？不过想到这，我却有点庆幸，自己可以再逃避一段时间。我有多想在自己的生命里为查理保留一席之地，我就有多害怕我们的初见。看到他为我现在的眼睛、皮肤而惊讶到眼珠都快掉下来的样子，看到他为我而受惊，脑子里不知道想到多么可怕的解释，我会受不了的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Liam was very territorial, but Siobhan wanted it to work out, and so it did."</div>

<div class="line_en">They must sit out of habit. Humans would notice someone standing for hours without ever shifting her weight to a different foot. Even now, I saw Rosalie brush her fingers against her hair and Carlisle cross his legs. Little motions to keep from being too still, too much a vampire. I would have to pay attention to what they did and start practicing.</div>

<div class="line_en">I realized that the others had no reason for sitting down. I was perfectly comfortable standing. It was just as restful as stretching out on a bed would be.

<div class="line_en">Renesmee told me about every minute happening of the day, and I got the feeling from the tenor of her little stories that she wanted me to know her every bit as much I wanted the same thing. It worried her that I had missed things -- like the sparrows that had hopped closer and closer when Jacob had held her, both of them very still beside one of the big hemlocks; the birds wouldn't come close to Rosalie. Or the outrageously icky white stuff -- baby formula -- that Carlisle had put in her cup; it smelled like sour dirt. Or the song Edward had crooned to her that was so perfect Renesmee played it for me twice; I was surprised that I was in the background of that memory, perfectly motionless but looking fairly battered still. I shuddered, remembering that time from my own perspective. The hideous fire…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蕾妮斯梅给我重放了这两天里几乎每一分钟的事，从她告诉我的所有小事中我了解到，她希望我能知道她每一滴的生活，就跟我希望的一样。她担心我错过某些事——像当雅各布抱着她站在铁杉树上时，蹦蹦跳跳靠近的小麻雀——如果是罗莎莉抱她的话小鸟是绝对不会靠近的；像卡莱尔倒到她杯子里的——可怕的甜腻的白色婴儿食品；像爱德华在她耳边吟唱的催眠曲——那么优美，蕾妮斯梅给我放了两遍。让我惊讶的是，我居然也在她的回忆里，一动不动满脸憔悴的站在最后面。这让我想起我自己那痛苦的回忆，浑身颤抖——那折磨人的火焰，痛苦的燃烧感……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mesmerized, I watched her dreams. There was no sense to it. Just colors and shapes and faces. I was pleased by how often my face -- both of my faces, hideous human and glorious immortal -- cropped up in her unconscious thoughts. More than Edward or Rosalie. I was neck and neck with Jacob; I tried not to let that get to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像被催眠了一样，我呆呆的看着她的梦境。里面完全没有实物，全部都是七彩的光、各种几何形状和一些人脸。看到自己的脸频频出现，我暗自乐着——两个我，丑陋的人类和灿烂的不朽之人——交替在她的梦中出现。比爱德华和罗莎莉都多，跟雅各布不相上下，我试着不让那影响我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her hand fell away from my face as she drifted to sleep -- the backs of her eyelids were the pale lavender color of thin clouds before the sunrise. Careful not to disturb her, I lifted that hand back to my skin and held it there curiously. At first there was nothing, and then, after a few minutes, a flickering of colors like a handful of butterflies were scattering from her thoughts.</div>

<div class="line_en">After almost an hour -- the others were still deeply absorbed in their discussion, Seth and Jacob snoring in harmony on the couch -- Renesmee's memory stories began to slow. They got slightly blurry around the edges and drifted out of focus before they came to their conclusions. I was about to interrupt Edward in a panic -- was there something wrong with her? -- when her eyelids fluttered and closed. She yawned, her plump pink lips stretching into a round O, and her eyes never reopened.</div>
