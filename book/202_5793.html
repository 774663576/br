The Deathly Hallows… such rubbish… although actually," a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, "he might have made it all up, mightn't he? He probably doesn't believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我们为什么去那儿？”几分钟的沉默之后，赫敏叹息着，“哈利，还是你说得对，又是一个戈德里克山谷，完全是浪费时间！死亡圣器……真是垃圾……不过，”她似乎突然冒出了新的想法，“不过这一切可能是他捏造的，不是吗？他很可能根本不相信死亡圣器，只是为了等食死徒到来，拖着我们不停地说话！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't think so," said Ron. "It's a damn sight harder making stuff up when you're under stress than you'd think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不这么认为，”罗恩说，“在那种紧急关头，现编一套故事要比你想象的困难得多。我是在被搜捕队抓住后体会到的。跟捏造一个新人比起来，装成是斯坦就容易得多，因为我对他有点了解。老洛夫古德当时的压力非常大，要想办法把我们拖住。为了跟我们不停地交谈，我想他对我们讲了真话，或者说他认为那是真的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But she, the girl in the tale, didn't really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn't he? He even lived with her for a while…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是她，故事里的那个女孩，也没有真的回来呀，不是吗？故事说人们一旦去世，就属于阴间了。但是，那个老二仍然看到了她，和她说话，不是吗？甚至还和她一起生活了一段时间……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. "I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he'd been anyone famous or done anything important, I'm sure he'd be in one of our books. The only place I've managed to find the name "Peverell" is Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher," she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. "It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，”赫敏答道，似乎因转移话题而松了口气，“在他的墓上看到那个标志后，我查过他。如果他有名气或者做过什么重要的事情，一定会出现在我们的某一本书里。但惟一提到过‘佩弗利尔’的书是《生而高贵：巫师家谱》，我从克利切那里借的。”看到罗恩扬起了眉毛，她解释道：“那书里列的都是父系血统已经绝种的纯血统家族。很明显，佩弗利尔家族是最早消失的家族之一。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name "Peverell": a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he CRIed aloud, "Marvolo Gaunt!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，哈利脑海里灵光一闪，被“佩弗利尔”这个名字触动的记忆跳了出来：一个肮脏的老头子，在魔法部官员面前挥舞着一枚丑陋的戒指。哈利大声叫道：“马沃罗·冈特！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why not?" said Harry excitedly. "Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn't the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He'd have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么不会呢？”哈利激动地说，“马沃罗·冈特是个愚昧的老饭桶，活得像猪一样，惟一关心的就是他的血统。如果那枚戒指已经传了好几个世纪，他很可能不知道那到底是什么。那个家里没有书，相信我，他不是那种读童话给小孩子听的人。他肯定很想把那石头上的刮痕说成是纹章，因为对他来说，拥有纯血统 就意味着身份高贵。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione's flat disbelief nor Ron's persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry's belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand's fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort's mind as well as before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就连两个同伴坚持要讨论的银色牝鹿之谜，对哈利来说似乎也不再重要，只是个略微有趣一些的插曲罢了。对他来说惟一要紧的另一件事，就是伤疤又开始刺痛了。他努力掩饰着不让同伴知道。每次疼痛时他都会找机会独处，但是看到的东西却令他失望。他和伏地魔共享的图像质量变差了，变得模糊了，好像焦距老是对不准。哈利只能看到一个模糊的、头盖骨似的物体，还有似乎是一座山的影子，而以前的图像清晰逼真。这个变化让哈利有点不安，担心自己和伏地魔之间的联系已经破坏了。不管他对赫敏是怎么说的，他心里其实一直既害怕又珍惜这个联系。不知怎的，哈利觉得图像模糊，不如人意与他的魔杖损坏有关，似乎都是黑刺李木魔杖的错，使他不再能够像以前一样清楚地看到伏地魔的心思。">查看中文翻译</div>
