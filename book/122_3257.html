<div class="line_en">Davies had another piece of news. "The Kormoran is here in harbour too. It must have been them watching us, surely? And then passing the information on to von Brüning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯还带回一个消息。“‘鸬鹚’号也来这个港口了。肯定是他们在监视我们吧？然后再把消息告诉冯布吕宁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Almost certainly von Brüning wants to know more about us," I said. "We must be very careful what we say to him. Perhaps he'll come on board and ask to see our log."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我差不多可以肯定，冯布吕宁想知道咱俩更多的事情。”我说，“我们跟他说话得非常谨慎。说不定他会来咱们船上，要咱们的航海日志看。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I slept very comfortably that night, and was woken by the sound of Davies talking in his limited German to someone on the shore. When he came on board, he told me that he had met Commander von Brüning, who had invited us to have a drink in the village pub with him at twelve o'clock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那晚我睡得很舒服，早上是被戴维斯的说话声吵醒的，他正用有限的德语跟岸上的什么人交谈。回到船上后，他告诉我他遇到了冯布吕宁艇长，艇长邀我俩12点去村里的酒馆喝杯酒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In that case we must show it to him. Let's be open about it! I hate hiding things, anyway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那样的话我们就得给他看。咱们就坦率点儿吧！反正我是讨厌藏着掖着的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so we decided on an important change of plan, to bring our log and charts out of their hiding-place, and be as honest as we could. But just how much did von Brüning know? Did he know that we had not fired a shot at a single duck in the North Sea, and that we had explored the sands all along the coast? Did he know about Dollmann's attempt to get rid of Davies, and Davies's lucky escape? We could not tell. So it would be safer to tell the truth as far as possible in the coming interview.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我们决定来一个重大转变，把藏着的航海日志和海图拿出来，尽可能地开诚布公。可是冯布吕宁到底知道多少？他知道我们在北海一枪也没开、一只鸭子也没打，而是把沿岸的沙洲考察了个遍吗？他知道多尔曼曾经试图除掉戴维斯，而戴维斯又侥幸脱险吗？我们心里没底。因此，接下来的见面还是尽可能实话实说，这样安全些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But first we tried to find out something about the Kormoran, so after breakfast we went for a walk round the village. The people were very friendly, and we stopped to talk to two of the fishermen. We asked them about the boats in the harbour, and they told us that the Kormoran was not a local fishing boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，我们打算先调查一下“鸬鹚”号，便在早饭之后去村子里走了走。村里人很友好，我们停下来跟两个渔民聊天，问起港口里的那些船。他们告诉我们，“鸬鹚”号不是当地的渔船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's from Memmert," they said. "She's trying to raise an old French ship, loaded with gold, that sank off Juist. Her captain, Herr Grimm, is in charge of the work. That's him over there." They pointed to a man standing on the bridge across the little stream that ran into the harbour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它是从梅默尔特岛来的。”他们说道，“要来打捞一艘满载黄金的法国古船，很久以前在于斯特附近海域沉没的。这事儿归船长格林先生管，他就在那儿。”他们指向桥上站着的一个男人，桥下的小河流入港口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We walked out on the sand to inspect this channel, and then walked slowly back. "Don't forget," I said, "when we talk to von Brüning, just be yourself. You need only tell one lie, about the trick Dollmann played you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们踩着沙子往外走，察看这段水道，又慢慢走回来。“别忘了，”我说，“跟冯布吕宁说话的时候，你不用伪装什么。只有一点需要撒谎，就是多尔曼耍你那件事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right, I'll leave you to do most of the talking. Look, there's Grimm again. Look at his boots as we pass him." When we did, we saw that Grimm was wearing shoes, though of course that did not prove he had left one of his boots on the Dulcibella.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，主要还是由你来说话吧。看，格林又过来了。经过的时候看看他的靴子。”经过观察，我们发现格林穿的是鞋，不过当然，这也不能证明他确实把一只靴子丢在了‘达尔茜贝拉’号上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a few minutes after twelve when we entered the village pub. Davies introduced me to Commander von Brüning, and we sat down and ordered something to drink. I must say, I liked von Brüning as soon as I saw him. He was tall, with fair hair and a short beard. His eyes were blue and friendly, but extremely intelligent. I was glad we had decided to tell the truth -- the commander was not a man you could trick easily. We had decided that Davies should ask immediately about Dollmann, his supposed friend. I was horrified to see Davies's face go pink as he asked his question in German, but then I remembered an obvious reason for his embarrassment. I had to make sure, however, that von Brüning also understood the reason for the embarrassment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走进村子的酒馆时是12点过几分。戴维斯把我介绍给冯布吕宁艇长，我们坐下点了喝的。我得承认，我一看见冯布吕宁就喜欢上了他。他高高的个子，金黄色的头发，蓄着短胡须。蓝色的眼睛看起来很友好，却又透出绝顶的聪明。我很庆幸我们决定实话实说——这位艇长可不是那么好骗的。我们事先商量好，戴维斯一上来就要问起多尔曼，好像两人是好朋友似的。戴维斯用德语问出这个问题时，我被他涨红的脸庞吓了一跳，但转念一想，他尴尬的理由是显而易见的。不过，我得让冯布吕宁也知道戴维斯为什么脸红。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's a very fine boat," said Davies, his face getting even redder. Von Brüning smiled, looking thoughtfully at Davies. I saw a chance, and took it pitilessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那游艇很漂亮。”戴维斯说着，脸更红了。冯布吕宁笑而不语，若有所思地看着戴维斯。我看出这是个机会，毫不留情地下了手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh good, we can call on Fräulein Dollmann," I said to Davies, smiling meaningfully at von Brüning at the same time. Davies looked even more miserable.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Only part of the way," replied Davies. "The Medusa was too fast for me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们只同路了一段。”戴维斯回答，“‘美杜莎’号太快了，我跟不上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes! I remember," said von Brüning. "The weather was very bad that day. I thought you would have trouble round the Scharhörn."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在哪儿搁浅的？”冯布吕宁问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, he had already disappeared in the rain," replied Davies. "He couldn't have seen what happened. Anyway, it didn't matter. The tide was rising and I soon floated off. But I decided to spend the night in the shelter of the sandbank."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是，那时候他的船已经消失在雨中了。”戴维斯回答，“他不可能看到发生了什么。总之没关系啦。很快就是涨潮，我的船就漂离了沙洲。不过我还是决定在沙洲背风处过夜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The commander's smile disappeared and his eyes opened wide. His surprise was so obvious that I was sure he had heard nothing of this before.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“冒险对他来说不算什么。”我说，“他就爱冒险。有一个大风天，他还把我们的船停在霍恩霍恩沙洲背面呢，说那儿比港口安全，还干净得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Commander von Brüning laughed suddenly and turned to me. "Really," he said, "your friend amuses me. He has the most terrifying adventures, and makes them sound perfectly ordinary."</div>

<div class="line_en">Davies frowned and looked so angry with me that I decided to say no more about Dollmann's daughter.

<div class="line_cn" title="“说到沉船，”我说，“据说这儿附近有一艘，上面装满了法国的黄金。是真的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite true," said von Brüning. "The Corinne. She sank in 1811 off the island of Juist with gold on board to pay Napoleon's army -- in English money it would be worth about one and a half million pounds."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“千真万确。”冯布吕宁说，“是‘科琳娜’号。这艘船1811年在于斯特岛附近海域沉没，船上的黄金是拿破仑军队的军饷——折合成英镑，大概值150万吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Has anyone found it?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那有人找到它了吗？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Really?" he replied. "They're excellent people, but in the old days they used to take things from wrecks on this coast, so it's a way of life for them. They probably thought the Dulcibella was deserted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的吗？”冯布吕宁回答，“他们人倒是很好，不过以前常常会从沿岸这一带的遇难船只上捞东西，也算是种营生。很可能他们以为‘达尔茜贝拉’是艘无人的废船。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They found the wreck years ago, but it had broken up and the gold, being heavy, had sunk to the bottom. Several people have tried to find it but, of course, these sands keep moving all the time, so it's very difficult. Now a local company is trying. They're working from Memmert, an island near here. Herr Dollmann is one of the directors of the company. There's an engineer from Bremen involved, too -- he comes from time to time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“残骸好多年前就找到了，但是已经支离破碎，黄金由于比较重，沉到海底去了。好几个人试图寻找这些黄金，但是因为这一带的沙洲一直在移动，找起来十分困难。现在本地的一家公司正在想办法，从附近的梅默尔特岛开始找起。多尔曼先生就是这家公司的董事之一。有个不来梅的工程师也加入了——他时不时会过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">South of the island of Juist, and running right up to the mouth of the River Ems, there is a large sandbank. Its western edge remains uncovered at high tide, forming a small island, about three kilometres long, and from two hundred to five hundred metres wide. This island is Memmert. The chart showed only one building, which I guessed was the centre for Dollmann's company. The island stands on the deep water channel of the Ems, providing a shelter for ships to anchor, even at low tide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于斯特岛以南有一座巨大的沙洲，一直延伸到埃姆斯河入海口。沙洲的西缘涨潮时也露在水面上，形成了一座约3公里长、200到500米宽的小岛。这就是梅默尔特岛。海图显示岛上只有一座建筑，我猜这就是多尔曼公司的总部。这座岛位于埃姆斯河的深水道上，即使在落潮时也能供船只停泊、躲避风雨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The story of the French wreck and its gold provided a very good reason for Dollmann, Grimm, and von Brüning to be seen together, and to spend time on Memmert, especially as von Brüning had put money into the company. I was curious about Memmert. The more I thought about it, the more I believed that it might help us to solve the riddle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="载满黄金的法国沉船的故事为多尔曼、格林和冯布吕宁提供了绝佳的借口，让他们能够同时出现并待在梅默尔特岛，况且冯布吕宁还是公司的股东。我对梅默尔特岛充满好奇，越想越觉得这座岛或许能帮我们解开谜题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought hard about our conversation with von Brüning. Was he giving friendly advice to two young men on holiday, or a serious warning to two foreign spies? Perhaps he could not decide which we were. I was sure von Brüning had not known about Dollmann's attempt to kill Davies. He had guessed it, of course, when Davies told him about the short cut through the Telte channel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我认真思索着我们和冯布吕宁的谈话。他那番话是对两位年轻游客的友好建议，还是对两个外国间谍的严肃警告呢？也许他也弄不清我们究竟是游客还是间谍。我确定冯布吕宁不知道多尔曼曾企图除掉戴维斯。不过当戴维斯告诉他从泰尔特水道抄近路的事时，他肯定就猜到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies had still not spoken. He was annoyed with me, and I knew why. But I was annoyed with him too. There was an important piece of the puzzle that he had not told me about. I was waiting for him to speak first but, in the end, his silence was too much for me, and I had to break it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, you see, I had to talk about her, for two reasons. First, you seemed very embarrassed when we were talking about the Dollmanns. And second, although you described Dollmann's short cut very well, in the way we had agreed, it was still obvious that he had treated you badly. So why would you still feel friendly towards him? Why would you want to see him again? Your -- your feeling for her explains everything, you see -- why you were embarrassed, and why you want to see the Dollmanns again."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I find it very difficult to talk about things like this," said Davies, without looking at me. "I should have told you before, but I couldn't. The truth is, I do like -- Clara, very much. And I think she likes me too." Our eyes met for a second, in which all was said that needed to be said. "But I'm sure she knows nothing about what her father's doing," he continued. "I'm sure she's got nothing to do with it. And I hoped we could avoid bringing her into it."</div>

But, at the same time, he loved Clara Dollmann, the daughter of a suspected traitor. It seemed that he could not take his great chance without hurting the woman he loved. It was a terrible position to be in.</div>
