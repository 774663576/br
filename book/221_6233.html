But from the day he agreed to my revised plan, I knew she had been afraid to tell him he shouldn't. She seemed to be afraid of talking to us at all that last week. She sat with Will in silence, talking only to the medical professionals. Or busied herself in her garden, cutting things down with frightening efficiency.</div>

<div class="line_en">The online quad community had given me reams of information, warnings, legal rights and checklists. I had subsequently triple-checked with the airline that we would be given bulkhead seats, and that Will would be boarded first, and not moved from his power chair until we were actually at the gates. Nathan would remain on the ground, remove the joystick and turn it to manual, and then carefully tie and bolster the chair, securing the pedals. He would personally oversee its loading to protect against damage. It would be pink-tagged to warn luggage handlers of its extreme delicacy. We had been allocated three seats in a row so that Nathan could complete any medical assistance that Will needed without prying eyes. The airline had assured me that the armrests lifted so that we wouldn't bruise Will's hips while transferring him from the wheelchair to his aircraft seat. We would keep him between us at all times. And we would be the first allowed off the aircraft.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every time I looked at Will I wondered if I had done the right thing. Will had only been cleared by his GP for travel the night before. He ate little and spent much of every day asleep. He seemed not just weary from his illness, but exhausted with life, tired of our interference, our upbeat attempts at conversation, our relentless determination to try to make things better for him. He tolerated me, but I got the feeling that he often wanted to be left alone. He didn't know that this was the one thing I could not do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次我看着威尔，我都在想我是不是做对了。前一天威尔的全科医生才允许他旅行。他吃得很少，几乎每天都在睡觉。看上去他不仅厌倦了生病，也厌倦了人生，我们的干预、我们乐观地尝试谈话的努力，想让事情变得更好的不屈不挠的决心，这些统统让他厌烦。他对我很容忍，但我老觉得他常想一个人待着。他不知道这是我不愿意做的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I hit the message boards, firing out questions. Where might be a good place for a far weaker Will to convalesce? Did anyone else know where we could go? Temperature was my main consideration -- the English climate was too changeable (there was nothing more depressing than an English seaside resort in the rain). Much of Europe was too hot in late July, ruling out Italy, Greece, the South of France and other coastal areas. I had a vision, you see. I saw Will, relaxing by the sea. The problem was, with only a few days to plan it and go, there was a diminishing chance of making it a reality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我登录留言板，提出一系列问题。对于威尔，一个越来越羸弱的人，哪里会是他养病的好地方？有人知道我们能去哪儿吗？温度是我主要的考虑因素——英国的天气太变幻无常了（没有什么地方比雨中的英国海滨度假胜地更让人沮丧的了）。七月底大部分欧洲国家都太热，除了意大利、希腊、法国南部和另外一些沿海地区。你瞧，我脑海中有一幅图景，我看见威尔在海边休憩。问题在于，计划并实施只有几天时间了，让希望成真，机会渺茫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had become my catchphrase, ever since I had worked out what I wanted to do. Since my conversation with Nathan in the annexe, I had been filled with a renewed zeal to prove them all wrong. Just because we couldn't do the holiday I'd planned did not mean that Will could not do anything at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从我合计出想做的事情之后，这句话已经成为了我的口头禅。那天在配楼和内森谈完话后，我就重燃起一种激情，要证明他们都是错的。我们不能按计划去旅行，并不意味着威尔什么都不能做了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were commiserations from the others, and many, many stories about pneumonia. It seemed to be the spectre that haunted them all. There were a few suggestions as to places we could go, but none that inspired me. Or, more importantly, none that I felt Will would be inspired by. I did not want spas, or places where he might see other people in the same position as he was. I didn't really know what I wanted, but I scrolled backwards through the list of their suggestions and knew that nothing was right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他人对我表示了同情，他们讲述了很多很多有关肺炎的故事，这似乎也是萦绕在他们心头的恐惧。有人建议了几个我们可以去的地方，但是没有一个地方触动到我。或者说，更重要的是，没有一个地方让我觉得威尔会被触动。我不想泡温泉，也不想去他可能会见到跟他处境一样的人的地方。我真的不知道我要什么，我向后滚动他们的建议单，没有一个靠谱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Ritchie, that chat-room stalwart, who had come to my aid in the end. The afternoon that Will was released from hospital, he typed:</div>

<div class="line_en">I had rung the number he gave me and spoken to a middle-aged man with a broad Yorkshire accent. When he told me what he had in mind, a little bell of recognition rang somewhere deep in my memory. And within two hours, we had it sorted. I was so grateful to him that I could have cried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拨了他给我的电话号码，跟一个有着浓重约克郡口音的中年男人谈了话。他告诉我他的想法时，一只表示认可的小铃在我记忆深处响起。不到两个小时，我们就确定了。我非常感激他，恨不得放声大哭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That said, by the time we left I was almost as exhausted as Will. I had spent days wrangling with the finer requirements of quadriplegic travel, and right up until the morning we left I had not been convinced that Will would be well enough to come. Now, seated with the bags, I gazed at him, withdrawn and pale in the bustling airport, and wondered again if I had been wrong. I had a sudden moment of panic. What if he got ill again? What if he hated every minute, as he had with the horse racing? What if I had misread this whole situation, and what Will needed was not an epic journey, but ten days at home in his own bed?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们离开之前，我几乎跟威尔一样疲惫不堪。我花了好几天时间才搞到了四肢瘫痪者旅行的精细要求，直到我们离开的那个早上我还不确定威尔的身体是否好到可以去。现在，旁边就是包裹，我盯着他，在喧闹的机场，他沉默寡言，脸色苍白。我又一次怀疑我是不是做错了，我突然感到一阵恐慌。要是他又病了呢？要是他像赛马那次一样，每分钟都觉得是种折磨呢？要是我搞错了整个情形呢？要是威尔需要的不是一个史诗般的旅程，而是在家里自己的床上待十天呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They're calling our flight," Nathan said, as he strolled back from the duty free. He looked at me, raised an eyebrow, and I took a breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们叫到我们的航班了。”内森说。他刚从免税店逛回来，他看着我，扬了扬眉，吸了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flight itself, despite twelve long hours in the air, was not the ordeal I had feared. Nathan proved himself dextrous at doing Will's routine changes under cover of a blanket. The airline staff were solicitous and discreet, and careful with the chair. Will was, as promised, loaded first, achieved transfer to his seat with no bruising, and then settled in between us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然要在空中飞行十二个小时，但我并不害怕这场煎熬。内森证明他能在一床毯子下面熟练地做威尔日常的更换工作。航空公司的工作人员非常热心谨慎，对轮椅也很当心。威尔果真如承诺的那样，第一个登机，转移至他的座位时，一点没撞伤，在我们俩之间安坐下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Within an hour of being in the air I realized that, oddly enough, above the clouds, provided his seat was tilted and he was wedged in enough to be stable, Will was pretty much equal to anyone in the cabin. Stuck in front of a screen, with nowhere to move and nothing to do, there was very little, 30,000 feet up, that separated him from any of the other passengers. He ate and watched a film, and mostly he slept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说来也奇怪，飞行了不到一个小时，我就意识到在云层之上，若是威尔的座椅倾斜一点，挤得平稳一些，他跟客舱里的其他人几乎没两样。陷在一个屏幕之前，没地方可以移动，也没事可做，在三万英尺的高空，没有什么可以将他与其他乘客区别开来。他吃着东西，看着电影，不过大部分时候他睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nathan and I smiled cautiously at each other and tried to behave as if this were fine, all good. I gazed out of the window, my thoughts as jumbled as the clouds beneath us, unable yet to think about the fact that this was not just a logistical challenge but an adventure for me -- that I, Lou Clark, was actually headed to the other side of the world. I couldn't see it. I couldn't see anything beyond Will by then. I felt like my sister, when she had first given birth to Thomas. "It's like I'm looking through a funnel," she had said, gazing at his newborn form. "The world has just shrunk to me and him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内森和我谨慎地朝对方笑，尽量表现得像是这很好，一切都好的样子。我向窗外望去，我的思绪像下面的云彩一样纷乱，这对我而言不仅仅是后勤的挑战，也是一次冒险——我，露易莎•克拉克，真的去往世界的另一边了。我看不到这个，到那时我除了威尔什么也看不到。我像我妹妹，当时她刚刚生下托马斯。“就像我通过一个小孔来看东西，”她说，盯着她的新生儿，“世界只剩下我和他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then I woke to find that the air stewardess was standing over us with breakfast, that Will was talking to Nathan about a film they had just watched together, and that -- astonishingly, and against all the odds -- the three of us were less than an hour away from landing in Mauritius.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，我醒过来发现空姐端着早餐站在我们身边，威尔和内森讨论着他们刚才一起看过的一部电影，令人惊奇的是，经历种种困难——我们三个离登陆毛里求斯不到一小时的航程了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't think I believed that any of this could actually happen until we touched down at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport. We emerged groggily through Arrivals, still stiff from our time in the air, and I could have wept with relief at the sight of the operator's specially adapted taxi. That first morning, as the driver sped us towards the resort, I registered little of the island. True, the colours seemed brighter than England, the sky more vivid, an azure blue that just disappeared and grew deeper and deeper to infinity. I saw that the island was lush and green, fringed with acres of sugar cane crops, the sea visible like a strip of mercury through the volcanic hills. The air was tinged with something smoky and gingery, the sun so high in the sky that I had to squint into the white light. In my exhausted state it was as if someone had woken me up in the pages of a glossy magazine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到我们在拉姆古兰爵士国际机场着陆，我才相信这一切真的发生了。我们昏昏沉沉地来到下客区，在空中待了太久，身体还是有点僵硬，看到旅行社特别改装过的车时，我欣慰得差点流下眼泪。第一个早上，司机载我们去往度假胜地，我对这个小岛没留下什么印象。确实，比英国明亮，天空更清澈，蔚蓝色渐渐退去，变得越来越远，直至海天合一。小岛郁郁葱葱，四周皆是甘蔗作物，海像一条水银带穿过火山。空气中有点烟味和姜味，太阳高高地悬挂在天空，白色的光芒让我不得不眯起眼睛。在我如此疲乏的状态，就像是有人把我叫醒，让我欣赏时尚杂志中的风景。">查看中文翻译</div>

And then we pulled into a palm-tree-lined driveway, stopped outside a low framed building and the driver was already out and unloading our bags.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管我的感官在努力适应着不熟悉的情况，我还是一而再再而三地回头看威尔，他的脸苍白疲倦，他的头歪在肩上的角度有点奇怪。车驶入两边种植有棕榈树的车道，停在了一栋低矮的建筑外面，司机下车卸我们的包裹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We declined the offer of iced tea, of a tour around the hotel. We found Will's room, dumped his bags, settled him into his bed and almost before we had drawn the curtains, he was asleep again. And then there we were. I had done it. I stood outside his room, finally letting out a deep breath, while Nathan gazed out of the window at the white surf on the coral reef beyond. I don't know if it was the journey, or because this was the most beautiful place I had ever been in my life, but I felt suddenly tearful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们拒绝了冰茶以及绕旅店环一圈的好意。我们找到了威尔的房间，放下他的包，把他安置到床上，我们连窗帘都还没拉上，他就又睡着了。就剩我们俩了。我做到了。我站在他房间门外，终于长出了一口气。内森看向窗外珊瑚礁那边的白色海浪。我不知道是不是因为这场旅行，抑或这是我人生中见过的最美的地方，我突然泪流满面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hotel had, as promised, come up with the special wheelchair with wide wheels, and most mornings Nathan transferred Will into it and we all three walked down to the beach, me carrying a parasol so that I could protect him if the sun grew too fierce. But it never did; that southern part of the island was renowned for sea breezes and, out of season, the resort temperatures rarely rose past the early twenties. We would stop at a small beach near a rocky outcrop, just out of view of the main hotel. I would unfold my chair, place myself next to Will under a palm tree, and we would watch Nathan attempt to windsurf, or waterski -- occasionally shouting encouragement, plus the odd word of abuse -- from our spot on the sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅馆方面，正如之前所承诺的，提供了有宽轮的特殊轮椅，大多数早上，内森会把威尔搬进轮椅，我们三个人一起走到海滩，我撑着一把遮阳伞，免得阳光太炙热时晒到他。但是阳光从没有过于毒辣，小岛的南部以海风和不合时令著称，温度很少超过二十度。我们可以在靠近岩礁的一片小海滩上休息，刚好看不到酒店主楼。我会在一棵棕榈树下展开我的椅子，坐在威尔旁边，我们一起看内森尝试风帆冲浪，或者水橇滑水——偶尔从我们在沙滩上的所在地为他呐喊助威，再加上一两句脏话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was almost three days before I started to believe him. Will slept for most of the first forty-eight hours -- and then, astonishingly, he began to look better. His skin regained its colour and he lost the blue shadows around his eyes. His spasms lessened and he began to eat again, wheeling his way slowly along the endless, extravagant buffet and telling me what he wanted on his plate. I knew he was feeling more like himself when he bullied me into trying things I would never have eaten -- spicy creole curries and seafood whose name I did not recognize. He swiftly seemed more at home in this place than I did. And no wonder. I had to remind myself that, for most of his life, this had been Will's domain -- this globe, these wide shores -- not the little annexe in the shadow of the castle.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first the hotel staff wanted to do almost too much for Will, offering to push his chair, constantly pressing cool drinks upon him. We explained what we didn't need from them, and they cheerfully backed off. It was good, though, during the moments when I wasn't with him, to see porters or reception staff stopping by to chat with him, or sharing with him some place that they thought we should go. There was one gangly young man, Nadil, who seemed to take it upon himself to act as Will's unofficial carer when Nathan was not around. One day I came out to find him and a friend gently lowering Will out of his chair on to a cushioned sunbed he had positioned by "our" tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初酒店员工简直什么都想为威尔做，提出帮他推轮椅，不时让他喝冷饮。我们解释了哪些事情不需要他们帮忙后，他们高兴地撤退了。不过我不在他身边时，看到勤杂工或接待人员停下来跟他聊天，向他推荐我们应该去的地方，感觉真的不错。有一个瘦瘦高高的小伙子，奈迪尔，内森不在威尔旁边时，他似乎担当起了威尔非正式护理的职责。有一天我出去，看到他和他的朋友轻轻放低威尔的轮椅，把他放到了有垫子的浴床上，那是他之前摆在“我们的”树下的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for me, as my anxiety about Will's health began to ebb, I slowly began to suspect that I was actually in paradise. I had never, in my life, imagined I would spend time somewhere like this. Every morning I woke to the sound of the sea breaking gently on the shore, unfamiliar birds calling to each other from the trees. I gazed up at my ceiling, watching the sunlight playing through the leaves, and from next door heard the murmured conversation that told me Will and Nathan had already been up long before me. I dressed in sarongs and swimsuits, enjoying the feeling of the warm sun on my shoulders and back. My skin grew freckled, my nails bleached, and I began to feel a rare happiness at the simple pleasures of existing here -- of walking on a beach, eating unfamiliar foods, swimming in warm, clear water where black fish gazed shyly from under volcanic rocks, or watching the sun sink fiery red into the horizon. Slowly the past few months began to slip away. To my shame, I hardly thought of Patrick at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就我个人而言，我对威尔健康的担心开始消退，我渐渐怀疑自己真的身处天堂。我以前从未想过会来这样的地方度假。每天早上，海水轻拍着岸边，陌生的鸟儿在树木间彼此呼唤的声音把我叫醒。我盯着天花板，看着阳光在树叶间嬉戏，从隔壁房间传来低声的谈话，告诉我威尔和内森早就起床了。我穿上莎笼裙和泳衣，享受着照在我肩上和背部的温暖阳光。我的皮肤生了色斑，指甲发白，待在这里的这种简单的愉悦——在海滩上漫步，吃新奇的食物，在温暖清澈的水里游泳，黑鱼从火山岩后面羞怯地探出头来，看着火红的太阳沉入地平线，让我感觉到一种难得的幸福。过去的几个月渐渐溜走。我感到羞愧的是，我很少想到帕特里克。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Our days fell into a pattern. We ate breakfast together, all three of us, at the gently shaded tables around the pool. Will usually had fruit salad, which I fed to him by hand, and sometimes followed up with a banana pancake as his appetite grew. We then went down to the beach, where we stayed -- me reading, Will listening to music -- while Nathan practised his watersport skills. Will kept telling me to try something too, but at first I said no. I just wanted to stay next to him. When Will insisted, I spent one morning windsurfing and kayaking, but I was happiest just hanging around next to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的日子落入一种模式。我们三个人围坐在池塘旁边有凉荫的桌边，一起吃早餐。威尔通常吃水果沙拉，我拿手喂他，他的食欲增长时，再给他一个香蕉薄煎饼。然后我们到海滩，待在那儿——我读书，威尔听音乐——内森训练着水上运动的技能。威尔一直让我也尝试做点事情，但一开始我拒绝了，我就想待在他旁边。威尔一再坚持，我便在一个早上去风帆冲浪和划独木舟了，不过在他身旁闲荡时我最开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Occasionally if Nadil was around, and the resort was quiet, he and Nathan would ease Will into the warm water of the smaller pool, Nathan holding him under his head so that he could float. He didn't say much when they did this, but he looked quietly contented, as if his body were remembering long-forgotten sensations. His torso, long pale, grew golden. His scars silvered and began to fade. He grew comfortable without a shirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="偶尔要是奈迪尔在旁边，整个度假区又很安静时，他和内森就把威尔移动到小水池的暖水区，内森扶住他头下面的部位，他就可以漂浮。他们这样做时，他没多说什么，不过他看起来满足又安详，似乎他的身体正在回忆早就忘却的感觉。他的身体，长期都是苍白的颜色，现在变成金色。他的伤疤闪着银色光泽，开始消退。不穿衬衣，他也很自在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the afternoons, when the temperatures were at their highest, Will would return to his room and sleep for a couple of hours. I would swim in the pool, or read my book, and then in the evening we would all meet again to eat supper at the beachside restaurant. I swiftly developed a taste for cocktails. Nadil had worked out that if he gave Will the correct size straw and placed a tall glass in his holder, Nathan and I need not be involved at all. As dusk fell, the three of us talked of our childhoods and our first boyfriends and girlfriends and our first jobs and our families and other holidays we had had, and slowly I saw Will re-emerge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午，温度最高的时候，威尔会回房间睡两个小时。我去水池游泳，或者读书，晚上我们又会聚在一起在海边餐馆吃晚餐。我很快喜欢上了鸡尾酒。奈迪尔证明只要他给威尔正确型号的麦管，在他的杯托放上一大杯饮料，内森和我就不用管了。每当暮色降临，我们三个聊起我们的童年、最初的男朋友和女朋友，最初的工作，我们的家庭以及以前的度假经历，渐渐地我看见威尔重新出现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At lunchtime we would wheel our way over to one of the resort's three restaurants. The surface of the whole complex was tiled, with only a few small steps and slopes, which meant that Will could move in his chair with complete autonomy. It was a small thing, but him being able to get himself a drink without one of us accompanying him meant not so much a rest for me and Nathan as the brief removal of one of Will's daily frustrations -- being entirely dependent on other people. Not that any of us had to move much anywhere. It seemed wherever you were, beach or poolside, or even the spa, one of the smiling staff would pop up with some drink they thought you might like, usually decorated with a fragrant pink flower. Even as you lay on the beach, a small buggy would pass, and a smiling waiter would offer you water, fruit juice, or something stronger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午饭时我们会去景区三个餐馆中的一个。整个建筑的表面都覆盖着砖瓦，只有一些小台阶和斜坡，威尔可以完全自主地移动轮椅。这是一件很小的事情，但他可以不需我们陪伴，自己拿喝的，这并不仅仅意味着我和内森可以休息一下，更重要的是威尔可以暂时消除他日常生活中的一种挫折感——完全依赖于他人。到哪儿都不需要有人太操心，似乎无论你在哪里，海滩或是游泳池边，甚至健身中心，一个满面笑容的员工都会出现在身旁，端来他们觉得你可能会喜欢的饮料，通常还会拿上一朵芳香的粉红花朵。就算你躺在海滩上，一辆小车会经过，一个微笑着的服务员会给你提供水、果汁，或者更强劲一点儿的喝的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

I knew just how to move him now, how I could make his weight, his solidity, work with me. Holding him close to me, I leant across and placed a fat white pillow behind his shoulders before releasing him back into its soft embrace.

It's going to be okay. For the first time in my life I tried not to think about the future. I tried to just be, to simply let the evening's sensations travel through me. I can't say how long we stayed like that, just gazing at each other, but gradually Will's eyelids grew heavier, until he murmured apologetically that he thought he might… His breathing deepened, he tipped over that small crevasse into sleep, and then it was just me watching his face, looking at the way his eyelashes separated into little points near the corner of his eyes, at the new freckles on his nose.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two things happened on the last day. One was that, under pressure from Will, I agreed to try scuba diving. He had been on at me for days, stating that I couldn't possibly come all this way and not go under the water. I had been hopeless at windsurfing, barely able to lift my sail from the waves, and had spent most of my attempts at water-skiing faceplanting my way along the bay. But he was insistent and, the day before, he arrived back at lunch announcing that he had booked me in for a half-day beginners' diving course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一天发生了两件事。一件事是，出于威尔的压力，我尝试了潜水。他一直劝说我，说我不能来这么一趟连水底都不去一下。风帆冲浪我完全搞不定，几乎没法把帆从风浪中提起来，滑水时大部分尝试都头朝地跌倒在海湾。但他一直坚持，前一天他回来吃午餐时，宣布他给我预定了半天的初级潜水课程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The storm finally blew itself out sometime after 1am, disappearing somewhere out at sea, its flashes of anger growing fainter and then finally disappearing altogether, off to bring meteorological tyranny to some other unseen place. The air slowly grew still around us, the curtains settling, the last of the water draining away with a gurgle. Sometime in the early hours I got up, gently releasing my hand from Will's, and closed the French windows, muffling the room in silence. Will slept -- a sound, peaceful sleep that he rarely slept at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凌晨一点后风暴终于停歇，在海面上消失不见，愤怒的闪电也变得微弱，终于也没有了，将气象暴虐带到某个看不见的地方。空气渐渐静止，窗帘不再晃动，最后的水滴汩汩流走了。凌晨某个时分我起来，轻柔地把我的手从威尔手中拿开，关上落地长窗，整个房间变得安静。威尔睡着了——他在家很少能享有的一个舒适、平静的睡眠。">查看中文翻译</div>

Will and Nathan sat on the side of the pool as my instructor tried to get me to believe I would continue to breathe underwater, but the knowledge that they were watching me made me hopeless. I'm not stupid -- I understood that the oxygen tanks on my back would keep my lungs working, that I was not about to drown -- but every time my head went under, I panicked and burst through the surface.

<div class="line_en">Three-quarters of an hour later, I was gazing underwater at the brightly coloured landscape that had been hidden from view, forgetting to be afraid that my oxygen might fail, that against all evidence I would sink to the bottom and die a watery death, even that I was afraid at all. I was distracted by the secrets of a new world. In the silence, broken only by the exaggerated oosh shoo of my own breath, I watched shoals of tiny iridescent fish, and larger black and white fish that stared at me with blank, inquisitive faces, with gently swaying anemones filtering the gentle currents of their tiny, unseen haul. I saw distant landscapes, twice as brightly coloured and varied as they were above land. I saw caves and hollows where unknown creatures lurked, distant shapes that shimmered in the rays of the sun. I didn't want to come up. I could have stayed there forever, in that silent world. It was only when James started gesticulating towards the dial of his oxygen tank that I realized I didn't have a choice.</div>
