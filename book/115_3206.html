<div class="line_en">We went and stood by the car. No one said anything for a few minutes. Colonel Julyan handed round his cigarette case. Favell looked grey, rather shaken. I noticed his hands were trembling as he held the match. The man with the barrel-organ ceased playing for a moment and hobbled towards us, his cap in his hand. Maxim gave him two shillings. Then he went back to the barrel-organ and started another tune. The church clock struck six o'clock. Favell. began to speak. His voice was diffident, careless, but his face was still grey. He did not look at any of us, he kept glancing down at his cigarette and turning it over in his fingers. "This cancer business," he said; "does anybody know if it's contagious?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, you're all right, you're fine," said Favell, standing straight and looking at Colonel Julyan and Maxim. "You've got nothing to worry about any more. Max is on a good wicket now, isn't he? You've got your motive, and Baker will supply it in black and white free of cost, whenever you send the word. You can dine at Manderley once a week on the strength of it and feel proud of yourself. No doubt Max will ask you to be godfather to his first child."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，你们神气了，没事了，”费弗尔站直身子，望着朱利安上校和迈克西姆。“你们再没有什么可担心的了。迈克西姆现在占了上风，不是吗？而你则算是找到了吕蓓卡自杀的动机。只要你开一下尊口，贝克就会分文不取把白纸黑字的证词给你送上门来。由于出了这番力，你就可以每周到曼陀丽美餐一顿，沾沾自喜。不用说，迈克斯生下第一个娃娃还会请你当教父。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pull yourself together, man, for heaven's sake," said Colonel Julyan. "If you want a drink go back to the house and ask Baker. He knows how to treat for shock, I dare say. Don't make an exhibition of yourself in the street."</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim held open the door of the car, and Colonel Julyan climbed in. I sat down in my seat in the front. Favell still leant against the car and did not move. "I should advise you to get straight back to your flat and go to bed," said Colonel Julyan shortly, "and drive slowly, or you will find yourself in jail for manslaughter. I may as well warn you now, as I shall not be seeing you again, that as a magistrate I have certain powers that will prove effective if you ever turn up in Kerrith or the district. Blackmail is not much of a profession, Mr Favell. And we know how to deal with it in our part of the world, strange though it may seem to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆打开车门，朱利安上校钻了进去。我在前面的老位子上坐定。费弗尔仍然靠在他那辆车的车身上，没有动弹。“奉劝你还是直接回你的住处，上床去睡一觉，”朱利安上校不客气地说。“开车时慢着点，要不然，你会发现自己因撞死了人而坐班房的。以后你我再不会见面了，所以还是趁现在提醒你一句：我作为一个行政官，手里还有那么点权力。你要是以后再在克里斯或者本地区露面，就会尝到那点权力的厉害。敲诈勒索可不是什么好行当，费弗尔先生。我们这一带的人知道该怎么对付讹诈，尽管在你看来这或许有点新鲜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Favell was watching Maxim. He had lost the grey colour now, and the old unpleasant smile was forming on his lips. "Yes, it's been a stroke of luck for you, Max, hasn't it?" he said slowly; "you think you've won, don't you? The law can get you yet, and so can I, in a different way…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费弗尔的目光紧紧盯着迈克西姆。他的脸色已不像刚才那样灰白。嘴角又浮起那种眼熟的、叫人讨厌的微笑。“不错，这次你交了好运，迈克斯，是吗？”他慢悠悠地说。“你以为你赢了，是不？要知道，天网恢恢，疏而不漏；再说我也不会放过你的，不过是以另外一种方式…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Favell. "No, I won't keep you. You can go." He stepped back on to the pavement, the smile still on his lips. The car slid forward. As we turned the corner I looked back and saw him standing there, watching us, and he waved his hand and he was laughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”费弗尔说。“没什么要说了，我不想耽搁你们。请便吧。”他退到人行道上，嘴角仍挂着那丝隐笑。汽车开动了，在拐弯时，我回头一望，看见他站在原地盯着我们瞧。他朝我们挥挥手，还哈哈笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We drove on for a while in silence. Then Colonel Julyan spoke. "He can't do anything," he said. "That smile and that wave were part of his bluff. They're all alike, those fellows. He hasn't a thread of a case to bring now. Baker's evidence would squash it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车向前疾驶，大家都沉默着。过了一会儿，利朱安上校才开口说话；“他已经没门啦。他那么笑着挥手，无非是虚张声势的花招。这些家伙全是一路货。他现在没有一丁点儿可以起诉的理由。贝克的证词足以驳得他哑口无言。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maxim did not answer. I glanced sideways at his face but it told me nothing. "I always felt the solution would lie in Baker," said Colonel Julyan; "the furtive business of that appointment, and the way she never even told Mrs Danvers. She had her suspicions, you see. She knew something was wrong. A dreadful thing, of course. Very dreadful. Enough to send a young and lovely woman right off her head."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆没作声。我打眼角瞅了他一眼，看不出他脸上有什么表示。“我始终觉得，解决问题的关键就在贝克身上，”朱利安上校说。“那么偷偷摸摸地约大夫看病，甚至对丹弗斯太太也要瞒着。你瞧，她自己也早有怀疑，知道自己得了什么暗疾。当然，这是种可怕的毛病，非常可怕，足以让一个年轻漂亮的女人吓昏头。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's curious and very irritating," said Colonel Julyan slowly, "how long stories spread in country districts. I never know why they should, but unfortunately they do. Not that I anticipate any trouble over this, but it's as well to be prepared. People are inclined to say the wildest things if they are given half a chance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说来真有点莫名其妙，也叫人恼火，”朱利安上校慢条斯理地说，“稍微有点什么事，就会在乡下慢慢传开，搞得沸沸扬扬。我真不明白为什么会这样。不幸的是实际情况偏偏就是这样。我并不是说，我预料这事儿会引起什么风波。不过还是防患于未然的好。对一般人来说，只要一抓到机会，就会捕风捉影地编造出一些最离奇的谣言来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I suppose you never had any idea of this, de Winter?" said Colonel Julyan.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="汽车沿着笔直的公路继续向前。电线杆、长途汽车、敞篷赛车、相互间隔一定距离的带新辟花园的小型别墅，在我眼前纷纷闪过，在我脑子里交织成一幅幅毕生难忘的图案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course some people have a morbid dread of it," said Colonel Julyan. "Women especially. That must have been the case with your wife. She had courage for every other thing but that. She could not face pain. Well, she was spared that at any rate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然罗，有些人对这东西怀有一种病态的恐惧，”朱利安上校说。“尤其是妇女。你妻子想必就是这样。她天不怕，地不怕，唯独怕这个。她没有勇气面对病痛的折磨。不管怎么说，她总算免受了那一番话罪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't think it would do any harm if I quietly let it be known down in Kerrith and in the county that a London doctor has supplied us with a motive," said Colonel Julyan. "Just in case there should be any gossip. You never can tell, you know. People are odd, sometimes. If they knew about Mrs de Winter it might make it a lot easier for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，假使我在克里斯和郡里悄悄放点风，就说伦敦有位医生为我们提供了她自杀的动机，这不至于有什么坏处吧，”朱利安上校说。“无非是防个万一，免得别人说闲话。你知道，世上的事儿很难说。有时候人就是那么古怪。要是让他们知道德温特夫人当时得了癌症，说不定你俩的处境会好得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I'm sure she would be delighted to see you both as well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“六点半了，”朱利安上校说。“你们打算怎么样？我有个妹妹住在圣约翰园林。我想对她来次突然袭击，在她那儿叨扰一顿晚饭，然后从帕了顿车站搭末班车回去。我知道她这一星期都呆在家里。我相信她见到你们两位一定也很高兴。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When we came to the house Maxim drew up a little way ahead of the gate. "It's impossible to thank you," he said, "for all you've done today. You know what I feel about it without my telling you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们来到他妹妹那幢屋子面前，迈克西姆在离大门几步远的地方停车。“你今天为我们劳累奔走，”他说，“真不知该怎么感谢你才好。我不说你也知道我心里的感情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear fellow," said Colonel Julyan, "I've been only too glad. If only we'd known what Baker knew of course there would have been none of this at all. However, never mind about that now. You must put the whole thing behind you as a very unpleasant and unfortunate episode. I'm pretty sure you won't have any more trouble from Favell. If you do, I count on you to tell me at once. I shall know how to deal with him." He climbed out of the car, collecting his coat and his map. "I should feel inclined," he said, not looking directly at us, "to get away for a bit. Take a short holiday. Go abroad, perhaps."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的朋友，”朱利安上校说，“我很乐意为你效劳。要是我们早知道贝克所了解的情况，当然就不会有这么一番奔波了。不过，现在也不必再把这事儿搁在心上。你得把这件事当作生活中一段极不愉快、极为不幸的插曲，忘个干净。我敢肯定，费弗尔今后不会再来找你的麻烦。如果他再来，我希望你能马上告诉我。我知道怎么对付他。”他钻出汽车，随手捡起外衣和地图、“要是我处在你们的地位，”他嘴上这么说，眼光却不直接对着我们，“倒是有意离开一段时间。短期休假一次。或许到国外走一遭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We did not say anything. Colonel Julyan was fumbling with his map. "Switzerland is very nice this time of year," he said. "I remember we went once for the girl's holidays, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The walks are delightful." He hesitated, cleared his throat. "It is just faintly possible certain little difficulties might arise," he said, "not from Favell, but from one or two people in the district. One never knows quite what Tabb has been saying, and repeating, and so on. Absurd of course. But you know the old saying? Out of sight, out of mind. If people aren't there to be talked about the talk dies. It's the way of the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们俩没有接口。朱利安上校胡乱摺叠着手里的地图。“每年这时候，瑞士是个游览的好地方，”他说。“我记得，有一次我女儿过假期，我们一家上那儿去休息，玩得痛快极了。在那儿散步，令人心旷神怡。”他踌躇了一下，清了清嗓子。“到时候冒出某些小小的麻烦倒也不是绝对没有可能，”他说。“我不是说费弗尔会钻出来作梗，而是怕本地有人说闲话。谁也摸不准这一阵泰勃都对别人说些什么，翻来复去唠叨些什么来着。当然啦，全是无稽之谈。可你也知道那句老话，对不？眼不见心不想。被议论的对象不在眼前，流言蜚语就会随之绝迹。这就是世道常情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="待到迈克西姆停车，我才张开眼睛，坐直身子。我们停在索霍区的一条小街上，对面是一家小饭店，像这样的小饭店这儿街上比比皆是。我头昏眼花，茫然无措地四下张望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood for a moment, counting his belongings. "I've got everything, I think. Map, glasses, stick, coat. Everything complete. Well, goodbye, both of you. Don't get over-tired. It's been a long day."</div>

Now that we were alone again and the strain was over, the sensation was one of almost unbearable relief. It was like the bursting of an abscess. Maxim did not speak. I felt his hand cover mine. We drove on through the traffic and I saw none of it. I heard the rumble of the buses, the hooting of taxis, that inevitable, tireless London roar, but I was not part of it. I rested in some other place that was cool and quiet and still. Nothing could touch us any more. We had come through our crisis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的汽车向前驶去，到路口拐了个弯。我靠在椅背上，闭起眼睛。现在又剩下我们两个了，心头的重负业已卸去，真有一种几乎无法消受的轻松之感，好似脓肿一下子穿了头。迈克西姆沉默不语。我觉得他的手按在我手上。我们在车水马龙中穿行，可是我对这一切都视而不见。我只听见公共汽车驶过时发出的隆隆声，出租汽车喇叭的嘟嘟声，这是伦敦市内无法规避、永不停息的喧嚣，但我不属于这个嘈杂的世界。我在另一片清凉、安宁、粤寂的乐土之上休想。没有什么再能伤害我们。我们已经安然度过了险关。">查看中文翻译</div>

Frith telephoned down to Frank about it, and Frank told Frith to ask Mrs Danvers to come down to him at the office. He waited, and she never came. About ten minutes before I rang up, Frith telephoned to Frank again and said there had been a long-distance call for Mrs Danvers which he had switched through to her room, and she had answered. This must have been about ten past six. At a quarter to seven he knocked on the door and found her room empty. Her bedroom too. They looked for her and could not find her. They think she's gone. She must have gone straight out of the house and through the woods. She never passed the lodge-gates."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="到了下一个小镇，他停下车。汽车维修站的工人说他老婆还没有上床，可以给我们烧点茶。我们走出汽车，站在维修站里。我伸伸腿，跺跺脚，给发麻的四肢活活血。迈克西姆抽了一支烟。寒意侵人。维修站的门开着，冷风嗖嗖地吹进来；铁皮屋顶在风中轧轧作响。我浑身哆嗦，赶紧将上衣钮扣扣紧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We climbed back into the car. I settled myself once more under the rug. The car went on. I shut my eyes. There was the man with the wooden leg winding his barrel-organ, and the tune of "Roses in Picardy" hummed in my head against the jolting of the car. Frith and Robert carried the tea into the library. The woman at the lodge nodded to me abruptly, and called her child into the house. I saw the model boats in the cottage in the cove. and the feathery dust. I saw the cobwebs stretching from the little masts. I heard the rain upon the roof and the sound of the sea. I wanted to get to the Happy Valley and it was not there. There were woods about me, there was no Happy Valley. Only the dark trees and the young bracken. The owls hooted. The Moon was shining in the windows of Manderley. There were nettles in the garden, ten foot, twenty foot high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我重新爬进汽车，钻到毯子底下。汽车继续向前驶去。我闭上眼睛，眼前出现了那个装了条木头假腿的摇风琴的流浪艺人。那支《皮卡蒂的玫瑰》的曲子，合着汽车的颠簸节奏，在我脑中萦绕口旋。仿佛弗里思和罗伯特端着茶走进藏书室来；庄园看门人的老婆朝我匆匆一点头，就忙着招呼她孩子进屋去。我看见海湾小屋里的游艇模型，还有蒙在那上面的一层细尘。我看见小桅杆上挂满蜘蛛网，听到屋顶上的渐沥雨声和大海的涛声。恍惚中，我想到幸福谷去，幸福谷却无处可寻。四周密林层层，幸福谷已不复存在。只见树影森森，蕨丛遍地。猫头鹰发出凄唳悲呜。月亮在曼陀丽窗户上辉闪。花园里长满荨麻，足有十英尺、二十英尺之高。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We ought to be going," he said. "It's ten minutes to twelve." I left the shelter of the garage reluctantly. The cold wind blew in my face. The stars raced across the sky. There were threads of cloud too. "Yes," said the garage man, "summer's over for this year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们得走了，”他说。“差十分十二点。”我依依不舍地离开维修站这个避风的好去处。寒风刮在我面颊上。星斗满天，夜空里还飘着几丝云影。“是呀，”维修站工人说，“今年的夏天就这么过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back again into the moving unquiet depths. I was writing letters in the morning-room. I was sending out invitations. I wrote them all myself with a thick black pen. But when I looked down to see what I had written it was not my small square handwriting at all, it was long, and slanting, with curious pointed strokes. I pushed the cards away from the blotter and hid them. I got up and went to the looking-glass. A face stared back at me that was not my own. It was very pale, very lovely, framed in a cloud of dark hair. The eyes narrowed and smiled. The lips parted. The face in the glass stared back at me and laughed. And I saw then that she was sitting on a chair before the dressing-table in her bedroom, and Maxim was brushing her hair. He held her hair in his hands, and as he brushed it he wound it slowly into a thick rope. It twisted like a snake, and he took hold of it with both hands and smiled at Rebecca and put it round his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我重又堕入动荡紊乱的梦的深渊。我像是在晨室里写信，准备发送请柬。我握着一支粗杆黑墨水笔，一封一封写个没完。可是等我朝那些写好的请柬仔细一看，却发现上面的笔迹全然不是我那手方体小字，而是一种细长斜体字，笔划奇特地向上耸起。我把话束从吸墨纸台旁推开，把它们藏起。我站起身，走到镜子前，镜子里有张脸正盯着我望，那不是我自己的脸，而是一张极其苍白、极其俏丽的脸蛋，周围衬着乌云般的柔发。那双眼睛眯缝着，露出笑意。那两片嘴唇慢慢张开。镜子里的脸回瞪了我一眼，大笑起来。接着，我又看见她坐在自己卧室梳妆台前的椅子上，迈克西姆在替她梳理头发。他把她的头发握在手里，一面梳理，一面慢慢把它编成一股又粗又长的辫子。辫子像条蛇似地扭动起来，他用双手将它抓住，随后一边朝吕蓓卡微笑，一边往自己的颈脖上绕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He drove faster, much faster. We topped the hill before us and saw Lanyon lying in a hollow at our feet. There to the left of us was the silver streak of the river, widening to the estuary at Kerrith six miles away. The road to Manderley lay ahead. There was no moon. The sky above our heads was inky black. But the sky on the horizon was not dark at all. It was shot with crimson, like a splash of blood. And the ashes blew towards us with the salt wind from the sea.</div>
