<div class="line_en">The sky was a gloom of cloud, the woods dead and frozen. Roots grabbed at Theon's feet as he ran, and bare branches lashed his face, leaving thin stripes of blood across his cheeks. He crashed through heedless, breathless, icicles flying to pieces before him. Mercy, he sobbed. From behind came a shuddering howl that curdled his blood. Mercy, mercy. When he glanced back over his shoulder he saw them coming, great wolves the size of horses with the heads of small children. Oh, mercy, mercy. Blood dripped from their mouths black as pitch, burning holes in the snow where it fell. Every stride brought them closer. Theon tried to run faster, but his legs would not obey. The trees all had faces, and they were laughing at him, laughing, and the howl came again. He could smell the hot breath of the beasts behind him, a stink of brimstone and corruption. They're dead, dead, I saw them killed, he tried to shout, I saw their heads dipped in tar, but when he opened his mouth only a moan emerged, and then something touched him and he whirled, shouting…</div>

<div class="line_en">All his dreams had been cold of late, and each more hideous than the one before. Last night he had dreamed himself back in the mill again, on his knees dressing the dead. Their limbs were already stiffening, so they seemed to resist sullenly as he fumbled at them with half-frozen fingers, tugging up breeches and knotting laces, yanking fur-trimmed boots over hard unbending feet, buckling a studded leather belt around a waist no bigger than the span of his hands. "This was never what I wanted," he told them as he worked. "They gave me no choice." The corpses made no answer, but only grew colder and heavier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近来他所有的梦都奇寒无比，而且一个比一个恐怖。昨晚他又梦回磨坊，跪在地上给死人着装。他们四肢已近僵硬，当他用半冻僵的手指摸索行动时，尸体似乎在无声地抵抗。他为他们拉上裤子，系好裤带，把毛边皮靴套进僵直的脚，将镶钉皮带捆上他们的腰——那腰细得他双手就可握拢。“我不想这样做，”他边做边告诉他们，“但别无选择。”尸体没有回答，只是愈来愈冷，愈来愈沉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The night before, it had been the miller's wife. Theon had forgotten her name, but he remembered her body, soft pillowy breasts and stretch marks on her belly, the way she clawed his back when he fucked her. Last night in his dream he had been in bed with her once again, but this time she had teeth above and below, and she tore out his throat even as she was gnawing off his manhood. It was madness. He'd seen her die too. Gelmarr had cut her down with one blow of his axe as she cried to Theon for mercy. Leave me, woman. It was him who killed you, not me. And he's dead as well. At least Gelmarr did not haunt Theon's sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前天晚上，梦见的却是磨坊主的老婆。席恩早把她的姓名抛诸脑后，但还记得她的身体，记得她柔软舒适的乳房和小腹上的胎记，记得交欢时她在他背上搔抓。前晚的梦中，他们再度共枕，但这次她的嘴唇和下体都生了利牙，撕开他的喉咙，咬断他的老二。这真是太疯狂了。他也亲眼见她死了。当时她向席恩哭喊慈悲，却被葛马一斧砍翻。走开，女人。杀你的人是他，不是我。他不也偿命了吗？幸好葛马没来梦中扰他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dream had receded by the time Wex returned with the water. Theon washed the sweat and sleep from his body and took his own good time dressing. Asha had let him wait long enough; now it was her turn. He chose a satin tunic striped black and gold and a fine leather jerkin with silver studs… and only then remembered that his wretched sister put more stock in blades than beauty. Cursing, he tore off the clothes and dressed again, in felted black wool and ringmail. Around his waist he buckled sword and dagger, remembering the night she had humiliated him at his own father's table. Her sweet suckling babe, yes. Well, I have a knife too, and know how to use it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到威克斯端水进来，他才稍感心安。席恩洗去周身大汗和睡意，换上最好的服饰。阿莎让他等了个够——现在轮到她等。他挑选一条黑金条纹的绸缎上衣，一件银纽扣的上好皮背心…这才想起可恶的姐姐更看中刀剑而非华服，于是一边咒骂，一边脱下衣服，重新换装。这次他穿上粗糙的黑毛衣和锁甲，并在腰间捆好长剑和匕首——对那晚她在父亲桌前给予他的羞辱，他莫齿难忘。哼，你的乳儿宝宝，有何得意？我也有刀，而且用得比你好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Last of all, he donned his crown, a band of cold iron slim as a finger, set with heavy chunks of black diamond and nuggets of gold. It was misshapen and ugly, but there was no help for that. Mikken lay buried in the lichyard, and the new smith was capable of little more than nails and horseshoes. Theon consoled himself with the reminder that it was only a prince's crown. He would have something much finer when he was crowned king.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他戴上王冠。那是一圈细如手指的冷铁，上缀沉重的黑钻石和天然金块。手工有些误差，冠冕显得丑陋，但这是没办法的事。密肯已葬在临冬城的墓园，新铁匠只会钉钉子和打马蹄铁。这只是亲王的冠冕，席恩安慰自己，等当上国王，一定会做新的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not let the killings go unpunished. Farlen was as likely a suspect as any, so Theon sat in judgment, called him guilty, and condemned him to death. Even that went sour. As he knelt to the block, the kennelmaster said, "M'lord Eddard always did his own killings." Theon had to take the axe himself or look a weakling. His hands were sweating, so the shaft twisted in his grip as he swung and the first blow landed between Farlen's shoulders. It took three more cuts to hack through all that bone and muscle and sever the head from the body, and afterward he was sick, remembering all the times they'd sat over a cup of mead talking of hounds and hunting. I had no choice, he wanted to scream at the corpse. The ironborn can't keep secrets, they had to die, and someone had to take the blame for it. He only wished he had killed him cleaner. Ned Stark had never needed more than a single blow to take a man's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他当然不能让谋杀肆无忌惮地继续，否则一切便全乱套了。法兰有最大的嫌疑，于是席恩亲自主持审判，定他的罪，判他死刑。然而这却带来意想不到的尴尬。当驯兽长跪下，把头伸进木桩时，说道：“艾德大人一定会亲自动手。”席恩不愿被看轻，只得亲自操斧。他满手是汗，下斩时斧柄滑脱掌握，第一击竟砍在法兰双肩之间。接下来，他又连劈三次，方才割断骨头和肌腱，把头颅与身躯分离。他只觉天旋地转，眩然欲呕。从前他们同席而坐，把酒言欢，畅谈猎狗和捕猎的往事历历在目。我别无选择啊，他想对尸体尖叫。铁种守不了秘，他们非死不可，其后总得有人为此负责。他愧疚的是没能让他死得干脆。奈德·史塔克砍人头颅从来只需利落一击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside his door, Reek waited with Urzen and Kromm. Theon fell in with them. These days, he took guards with him everywhere he went, even to the privy. Winterfell wanted him dead. The very night they had returned from Acorn Water, Gelmarr the Grim had tumbled down some steps and broken his back. The next day, Aggar turned up with his throat slit ear to ear. Gynir Rednose became so wary that he shunned wine, took to sleeping in byrnie, coif, and helm, and adopted the noisiest dog in the kennels to give him warning should anyone try to steal up on his sleeping place. All the same, one morning the castle woke to the sound of the little dog barking wildly. They found the pup racing around the well, and Rednose floating in it, drowned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门外，臭佬、乌兹和科蒙一道候着他。席恩带上他们。这些日子来，他无论到哪儿都带着卫士，甚至上厕所都不例外。临冬城的人个个都要他死。从橡树河归来当晚，“严厉的”葛马就跌下楼梯，摔断了背。翌日，阿加莫名其妙地被割了喉咙。红鼻加尼紧张过度，以至于拒绝喝酒，连睡觉也是全副武装，裹着头巾和头盔，还把兽舍里最吵的狗带在身边，生怕有人趁他睡着偷偷接近。不过一切都是徒劳，某天清晨，全城被小狗狂野的吠叫声惊醒。他们发现小家伙疯了似的在水井边打转，红鼻漂在水中，咽了气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Asha. It was her doing. My own sweet sister, may the Others bugger her with a sword. She wanted him dead, so she could steal his place as their father's heir. That was why she had let him languish here, ignoring the urgent commands he had sent her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The killings stopped after Farlen's death, but even so his men continued sullen and anxious. "They fear no foe in open battle," Black Lorren told him, "but it is another thing to dwell among enemies, never knowing if the washerwoman means to kiss you or kill you, or whether the serving boy is filling your cup with ale or bale. We would do well to leave this place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法兰死后，谋杀便告终止，但他的手下却变得愈来愈紧张和阴郁。“大伙儿不怕上战场，”黑罗伦告诉他，“如今的问题是看不见摸不着，我们就居住敌人之中。谁也不知这里的仆妇是想亲你还是想杀你，谁也不知侍童给你满上的是美酒还是毒药。我建议赶紧撤离。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He found her in the high seat of the Starks, ripping a capon apart with her fingers. The hall rang with the voices of her men, sharing stories with Theon's own as they drank together. They were so loud that his entrance went all but unnoticed. "Where are the rest?" he demanded of Reek. There were no more than fifty men at the trestle tables, most of them his. Winterfell's Great Hall could have seated ten times the number.</div>

"Or is it Prince of Fools?"</div>

The slim, sad girl who wore a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore could only be Lyanna. Her brother Brandon stood beside her, and their father Lord Rickard just behind. Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a knife.

He knew them, every one; Jory Cassel and Fat Tom, Porther and Cayn and Hullen the master of horse, and all the others who had ridden south to King's Landing never to return. Mikken and Chayle sat together, one dripping blood and the other water. Benfred Tallhart and his Wild Hares filled most of a table.

The red leaves of the weirwood were a blaze of flame among the green. Ned Stark's tree, he thought, and Stark's wood, Stark's castle, Stark's sword, Stark's gods. This is their place, not mine.
