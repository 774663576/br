<div class="line_en">It must have happened then, thought Mrs Ramsay; they are engaged. And for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again -- jealousy. liked these girls, these golden-reddish girls, with something flying, something a little wild and harum-scarum about them, who didn't "scrape their hair off," weren't, as he said about poor Lily Briscoe, "skimpy". There was some quality which she herself had not, some lustre, some richness, which attracted him, amused him, led him to make favourites of girls like Minta. They might cut his hair from him, plait him watch-chains, or interrupt him at his work, hailing him (she heard them), "Come along, Mr Ramsay; it's our turn to beat them now," and out he came to play tennis.</div>

<div class="line_en">But indeed she was not jealous, only, now and then, when she made herself look in her glass, a little resentful that she had grown old, perhaps, by her own fault. (The bill for the greenhouse and all the rest of it.) She was grateful to them for laughing at him. ("How many pipes have you smoked today, Mr Ramsay?" and so on), till he seemed a young man; a man very attractive to women, not burdened, not weighed down with the greatness of his labours and the sorrows of the world and his fame or his failure, but again as she had first known him, gaunt but gallant; helping her out of a boat, she remembered; with delightful ways, like that (she looked at him, and he looked astonishingly young, teasing Minta). For herself --"Put it down there," she said, helping the Swiss girl to place gently before her the huge brown pot in which was the BOEUF EN DAUBE -- for her own part, she liked her boobies. Paul must sit by her. She had kept a place for him. Really, she sometimes thought she liked the boobies best. They did not bother one with their dissertations. How much they missed, after all, these very clever men! How dried up they did become, to be sure. There was something, she thought as he sat down, very charming about Paul. His manners were delightful to her, and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue eyes. He was so considerate. Would he tell her -- now that they were all talking again -- what had happened?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是她实际上并不嫉妒，只是有时当她强使自己看着镜子，看到自己老了时，心中有点怨恨而己。这也许是她自己的错。（修理温室的账单以及所有其他的事情。）她很感激她们和他打趣（“你今天抽了几烟斗烟了，拉姆齐先生？”），这使他似乎变成了年轻人；一个对女人非常有吸引力的男人，没有了负担，不再处于他工作之伟大世界的苦难或他的声名成败的压力之下，而是再一次如她和他最初相识时那样，瘦削但潇洒殷勤；她记得，他扶她下船；带着一副讨人喜欢的样子（她看着他，他看上去惊人地年轻，正在逗明塔）：至于她自己——“放在那儿吧。”她说，一面帮助那个瑞士女仆把放着焖牛肉的棕色大钵轻轻放在她面前——至于她自己，她喜欢自己的呆小伙子。保罗必须得坐在她的旁边。她替他留着一个位子。真的，有时候她觉得她最喜欢的就是那些呆小伙子。他们不拿论文来麻烦你。说到底，那些极端聪明的男人们错过了多少东西啊！真的，他们都变得多么干巴巴的啊！在保罗入座时她想道，他身上有着某种非常迷人之处。她觉得他的举止十分可爱，还有他那轮廓分明的鼻子和他明亮的蓝眼睛。他非常体贴人。他会告诉她——既然现在大家重又交谈了起来——究竟发生了什么事吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We went back to look for Minta's brooch," he said, sitting down by her. "We"-- that was enough. She knew from the effort, the rise in his voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had said "we." "We did this, we did that." They'll say that all their lives, she thought, and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice rose from the great brown dish as Marthe, with a little flourish, took the cover off. The cook had spent three days over that dish. And she must take great care, Mrs Ramsay thought, diving into the soft mass, to choose a specially tender piece for William Bankes. And she peered into the dish, with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine, and thought, This will celebrate the occasion -- a curious sense rising in her, at once freakish and tender, of celebrating a festival, as if two emotions were called up in her, one profound -- for what could be more serious than the love of man for woman, what more commanding, more impressive, bearing in its bosom the seeds of death; at the same time these lovers, these people entering into illusion glittering eyed, must be danced round with mockery, decorated with garlands.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is a French recipe of my grandmother's," said Mrs Ramsay, speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice. Of course it was French. What passes for cookery in England is an abomination (they agreed). It is putting cabbages in water. It is roasting meat till it is like leather. It is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables. "In which," said Mr Bankes, "all the virtue of the vegetable is contained." And the waste, said Mrs Ramsay. A whole French family could live on what an English cook throws away. Spurred on by her sense that William's affection had come back to her, and that everything was all right again, and that her suspense was over, and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock, she laughed, she gesticulated, till Lily thought, How childlike, how absurd she was, sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her, talking about the skins of vegetables. There was something frightening about her. She was irresistible. Always she got her own way in the end, Lily thought. Now she had brought this off -- Paul and Minta, one might suppose, were engaged. Mr Bankes was dining here. She put a spell on them all, by wishing, so simply, so directly, and Lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit, and supposed that it was partly that belief (for her face was all lit up -- without looking young, she looked radiant) in this strange, this terrifying thing, which made Paul Rayley, sitting at her side, all of a tremor, yet abstract, absorbed, silent. Mrs Ramsay, Lily felt, as she talked about the skins of vegetables, exalted that, worshipped that; held her hands over it to warm them, to protect it, and yet, having brought it all about, somehow laughed, led her victims, Lily felt, to the altar. It came over her too now -- the emotion, the vibration, of love. How inconspicuous she felt herself by Paul's side! He, glowing, burning; she, aloof, satirical; he, bound for adventure; she, moored to the shore; he, ready to implore a share, if it were a disaster, in his disaster, she said shyly:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是我祖母的一个法国菜谱，“拉姆齐夫人说，声音里有着极大的喜悦；当然这是法国菜，在英国所谓的烹调简直是可怕之极（大家都表示同意）。就是把卷心菜放进水里去煮。就是把肉烤得像牛皮。就是把美味的蔬菜皮全削掉，“蔬菜皮，”班克斯先生说，“是最有营养的。”再说有多浪费，拉姆齐夫人说。一个英国厨子扔掉的东西足可以养活一家法国人。她意识到威廉的爱慕重又回到了她的身上，一切又都好了，她的担心已成过去，现在她又可以自由地庆祝胜利嘲笑人生了，这极大地鼓舞了她，她开杯大笑，她手舞足蹈，致使莉莉想道，她是多么幼稚，多么可笑，坐在那里重又敞露出她全部的美，大谈蔬菜皮。她身上有着某种令人害怕的东西。她是无法抗拒的。她最终总能达到自己的目的，莉莉想。现在她又把这事办成了——保罗和明塔看来已经订婚了。班克斯先生在这里吃晚饭了。她就这么简单、这么直截了当地通过她的希望使大家身不由己地被她迷住；莉莉把她的丰富的内心和自己精神世界的贫乏进行对比，猜想部分是出于对这个奇异的、令人害怕的事件的信念（因为她的脸上喜气洋洋——她看上去并不年轻，但容光焕发），才使事件的中心保罗·雷勒激动得发抖，但又心不在焉，若有所思，沉默不语。拉姆齐夫人，莉莉感到，在谈论蔬菜皮的时候是在赞扬这件事，崇拜这件事；她把手伸出在它上面来获得温暖，来保护它，而在促使这一切发生之后，她不知为何大笑起来，把她的牺牲品，莉莉感到，领上祭坛。现在这种感情——这种爱恋、这种爱的颤动——也攫住了她。坐在保罗的旁边她感到自己是多么微不足道！他，容光焕发、热情洋溢；她，冷淡超脱，讽刺挖苦；他，即将启航去冒险；她，系缆于岸边；他，已经启动上路，义无反顾；她，形单影只，被遗留在后——为了能在他的灾难中，如果这是场灾难的话，求得一份，她胆怯地问道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help him, envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to pounce on the brooch half-hidden by some stone, and thus herself be included among the sailors and adventurers. But what did he reply to her offer? She actually said with an emotion that she seldom let appear, "Let me come with you," and he laughed. He meant yes or no -- either perhaps. But it was not his meaning -- it was the odd chuckle he gave, as if he had said, Throw yourself over the cliff if you like, I don't care. He turned on her cheek the heat of love, its horror, its cruelty, its unscrupulosity. It scorched her, and Lily, looking at Minta, being charming to Mr Ramsay at the other end of the table, flinched for her exposed to these fangs, and was thankful. For at any rate, she said to herself, catching sight of the salt cellar on the pattern, she need not marry, thank Heaven: she need not undergo that degradation. She was saved from that dilution. She would move the tree rather more to the middle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such was the complexity of things. For what happened to her, especially staying with the Ramsays, was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time; that's what you feel, was one; that's what I feel, was the other, and then they fought together in her mind, as now. It is so beautiful, so exciting, this love, that I tremble on the verge of it, and offer, quite out of my own habit, to look for a brooch on a beach; also it is the stupidest, the most barbaric of human passions, and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem's (Paul's was exquisite) into a bully with a crowbar (he was swaggering, he was insolent) in the Mile End Road. Yet, she said to herself, from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love; wreaths heaped and roses; and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but this -- love; while the women, judging from her own experience, would all the time be feeling, This is not what we want; there is nothing more tedious, puerile, and inhumane than this; yet it is also beautiful and necessary. Well then, well then? she asked, somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument, as if in an argument like this one threw one's own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on. So she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情的复杂性就在于此。她的经历，特别是住在拉姆齐家时的经历，使她同时强烈地具有两种截然相反的感觉；这是你的感觉，这是一方面；那是我的感觉，这是另一方面，而它们在她的头脑中搏斗，就像现在这样。这种爱是如此美好，如此令人激动，使我在它的边缘颤抖，并一反自己的习惯，主动提出到海滩上去寻找一枚胸针；同时它又是人类感情中最愚蠢、最野蛮的一种，把一个有着宝石般侧影的好小伙子（保罗的脸部轮廓优美）变成了一个在大街上拿着根撬棍的恶少（他狂妄自大，他傲慢无理）。然而她对自己说，从开天辟地以来人们就一直歌颂爱情；为它奉上数不清的花环和玫瑰；如果你问上十个人，九个会对你说他们惟一想得到的就是爱情；而女人们，根据她自己的经验，会永远感到，这并不是我们所要的；再也没有比爱情更沉闷乏味、更幼稚可笑、更野蛮残酷的了；然而爱情却又是美丽和必须的。那么怎么办，怎么办？她问道，似乎期望着别人把争论继续下去，仿佛在这样一种争论中，你只管射出自己小小的一箭，它显然射不中的，留待其余的人继续进行下去；于是她重又倾听别人在说些什么，也许他们会在这个爱情问题上给她一些启示。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, coffee!" said Mrs Ramsay. But it was much rather a question (she was thoroughly roused, Lily could see, and talked very emphatically) of real butter and clean milk. Speaking with warmth and eloquence, she described the iniquity of the English dairy system, and in what state milk was delivered at the door, and was about to prove her charges, for she had gone into the matter, when all round the table, beginning with Andrew in the middle, like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze, her children laughed; her husband laughed; she was laughed at, fire- encircled, and forced to veil her crest, dismount her batteries, and only retaliate by displaying the as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the prejudices of the British Public.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，咖啡！”拉姆齐夫人说。但其实问题更大的是（莉莉可以看出，她已经十分兴奋，说话的口气非常强烈）没有真正的黄油和洁净的牛奶，她激动地、滔滔不绝地描述着英国乳制品业的恶劣状况，牛奶送到门的时已经成了什么样子。她仔细了解过这件事，正要证明她的指控时，突然，从坐在中间的安德鲁开始，就像烈火从一丛荆豆蹿到又一丛荆豆，全桌的人都笑了。她的孩子们笑了；她的丈夫笑了；他们嘲笑她，她被大火包围，被迫掩甲卸炮，她惟一的回击是让班克斯先生看到餐桌上人们对她的嘲笑和奚落，以此作为一个例子，证明如果你攻击了英国公众的偏见，会落得怎样的下场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that Lily, who had helped her with Mr Tansley, was out of things, she exempted her from the rest; said "Lily anyhow agrees with me," and so drew her in, a little fluttered, a little startled. (For she was thinking about love.) They were both out of things, Mrs Ramsay had been thinking, both Lily and Charles Tansley. Both suffered from the glow of the other two. He, it was clear, felt himself utterly in the cold; no woman would look at him with Paul Rayley in the room. Poor fellow! Still, he had his dissertation, the influence of somebody upon something: he could take care of himself. With Lily it was different. She faded, under Minta's glow; became more inconspicuous than ever, in her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little Chinese eyes. Everything about her was so small. Yet, thought Mrs Ramsay, comparing her with Minta, as she claimed her help (for Lily should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her husband did about his boots -- he would talk by the hour about his boots) of the two, Lily at forty will be the better. There was in Lily a thread of something; a flare of something; something of her own which Mrs Ramsay liked very much indeed, but no man would, she feared. Obviously, not, unless it were a much older man, like William Bankes. But then he cared, well, Mrs Ramsay sometimes thought that he cared, since his wife's death, perhaps for her. He was not "in love" of course; it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are so many. Oh, but nonsense, she thought; William must marry Lily. They have so many things in common. Lily is so fond of flowers. She must arrange for them to take a long walk together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，她记着莉莉刚才帮助她照应过坦斯利先生，而现在超脱在谈话之外，便有意对她加以区别对待；她说“反正莉莉同意我的看法”，这样就把她也拉了进来，使她稍稍有点不安，稍稍有点吃惊。（因为她正想着关于爱情的事。）他们俩都超脱在外，拉姆齐夫人刚才在想，莉莉和查尔斯·坦斯利都这样。他们俩都因另外两个人的喜形于色而忍受着煎熬。他显然感到自己完全被冷落了；有保罗·雷勒在场，没有哪个女人会对他看上一眼的。可怜的家伙！不过他还有他的论文，是关于某个人对某件事的影响的：他能自己照顾自己。而莉莉就不同了。她在明塔的光艳之下黯然失色；她穿着那条小灰裙子、加上—张缩拢着的小脸和一双中国式的小眼睛．变得更加不显眼了。她的一切都是那么小。但是，拉姆齐夫人要求她帮助时（因为莉莉应该为她证明，她谈论奶制品时并不比她丈夫谈论靴子时话更多——他谈起他的靴子来，一说就是个把小时），把她和明塔做着比较，想道，这两个人里，到四十岁时莉莉会比明塔强。在莉莉身上贯穿着某种东西；闪耀着某种东西；一种拉姆齐夫人确实非常喜欢的属于她自己的东西，但是她恐怕没有哪个男人会喜欢。显然不会，除非是一个年纪大得多的男人，如威廉·班克斯那样的。再说他是关心的，是的，有时拉姆齐夫人想，自从他的妻子去世后，他也许对她是关心的。当然，他并没有在“恋爱”；这是那无数难以分类的好感中的—种。啊，别瞎想了，她想道：威廉一定得和莉莉结婚，他们之间有着这样多共同的东西：莉莉是多么喜欢花啊。他们俩都冷漠超脱，无所求于世。她一定要为他们安排出去长时间地散一次步。">查看中文翻译</div>

Everything seemed right. Just now (but this cannot last, she thought, dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots) just now she had reached security; she hovered like a hawk suspended; like a flag floated in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly, not noisily, solemnly rather, for it arose, she thought, looking at them all eating there, from husband and children and friends; all of which rising in this profound stillness (she was helping William Bankes to one very small piece more, and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot) seemed now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke, like a fume rising upwards, holding them safe together. Nothing need be said; nothing could be said. There it was, all round them. It partook, she felt, carefully helping Mr Bankes to a specially tender piece, of eternity; as she had already felt about something different once before that afternoon; there is a coherence in things, a stability; something, she meant, is immune from change, and shines out (she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights) in the face of the flowing, the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby; so that again tonight she had the feeling she had had once today, already, of peace, of rest.

<div class="line_cn" title="“安德鲁，”她说，“把盘子拿低点，不然我会把菜洒出来的。”（法式焖牛肉大获成功。）她放下勺子，感到这儿就是事物核心处的静谧的空间，她可以在这里活动或休息；现在可以等待、倾听（他们的菜都已添好了）；这时可以像只鹰突然从高处飞落而下，轻松地在笑声中升沉，把全部重量落在餐桌的另一头她丈夫正在说着的话上，他在谈着一千二百五十三的平方根，这个数碰巧是他火车票的号码。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What did it all mean? To this day she had no notion. A square root? What was that? Her sons knew. She leant on them; on cubes and square roots; that was what they were talking about now; on Voltaire and Madame de Stael; on the character of Napoleon; on the French system of land tenure; on Lord Rosebery; on Creevey's Memoirs: she let it uphold her and sustain her, this admirable fabric of the masculine intelligence, which ran up and down, crossed this way and that, like iron girders spanning the swaying fabric, upholding the world, so that she could trust herself to it utterly, even shut her eyes, or flicker them for a moment, as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the myriad layers of the leaves of a tree. Then she woke up. It was still being fabricated. William Bankes was praising the Waverly novels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些都是什么意思？直到今天她也没有任何概念。平方根？那是什么东西？她的儿子们知道。她把身体向他们靠去，听他们谈话的内容；他们在谈立方根和平方根；伏尔泰和斯塔尔夫人；拿破仑的性格；法国的土地使用制度；罗斯伯里勋爵；克里维的回忆录；她让这令人钦佩的男性智慧的织物支撑住她、维持着她，这男性智慧像上下左右交叉着的钢铁大梁，撑住摇摆晃动的织物，支撑起整个世界，使她可以把自己完全交给它，甚至可以把眼睛闭上，或者张张闭闭，就像个小孩子躺在枕头上抬眼对着树上的层层枝叶眨眼睛。这时她惊醒过来。织物仍在被编织着。威廉·班克斯正在称赞司各持的韦弗利系列小说。">查看中文翻译</div>
