<div class="line_en">In the last days of Narnia, far up to the west beyond Lantern Waste and close beside the great waterfall, there lived an Ape. He was so old that no one could remember when he had first come to live in those parts, and he was the cleverest, ugliest, most wrinkled Ape you can imagine. He had a little house, built of wood and thatched with leaves, up in the fork of a great tree, and his name was Shift. There were very few Talking Beasts or Men or Dwarfs, or people of any sort, in that part of the wood, but Shift had one friend and neighbour who was a donkey called Puzzle. At least they both said they were friends, but from the way things went on you might have thought Puzzle was more like Shift's servant than his friend. He did all the work. When they went together to the river, Shift filled the big skin bottles with water but it was Puzzle who carried them back. When they wanted anything from the towns further down the river it was Puzzle who went down with empty panniers on his back and came back with the panniers full and heavy. And all the nicest things that Puzzle brought back were eaten by Shift; for as Shift said, "You see, Puzzle, I can't eat grass and thistles like you, so it's only fair I should make it up in other ways." And Puzzle always said, "Of course, Shift, of course. I see that." Puzzle never complained, because he knew that Shift was far cleverer than himself and he thought it was very kind of Shift to be friends with him at all. And if ever Puzzle did try to argue about anything, Shift would always say, "Now, Puzzle, I understand what needs to be done better than you. You know you're not clever, Puzzle." And Puzzle always said, "No, Shift. It's quite true. I'm not clever." Then he would sigh and do whatever Shift had said.</div>

<div class="line_en">One morning early in the year the pair of them were out walking along the shore of Caldron Pool. Caldron Pool is the big pool right under the cliffs at the western end of Narnia. The great waterfall pours down into it with a noise like everlasting thunder, and the River of Narnia flows out on the other side. The waterfall keeps the Pool always dancing and bubbling and churning round and round as if it were on the boil, and that of course is how it got its name of Caldron Pool. It is liveliest in the early spring when the waterfall is swollen with all the snow that has melted off the mountains from up beyond Narnia in the Western Wild from which the river comes. And as they looked at Caldron Pool Shift suddenly pointed with his dark, skinny finger and said,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年初的一天早晨，这一对朋友出门沿着大锅渊的岸边散步。大锅渊又深又大，正位于纳尼亚西陆的悬崖绝壁之下。大瀑布从悬崖上轰然倾泻而下，声若接连不断的雷鸣，纳尼亚河则从另一边奔流而过。大瀑布使深渊里的水始终在跳跃、冒泡，绕着圈儿翻腾，仿佛一锅水在沸腾一般，因此自然而然地被叫做大锅渊。早春时节，大锅渊是最最生气勃勃的，那时纳尼亚背后西部荒原里群山上融雪的水使大瀑布丰沛极了，而纳尼亚河便是发源于荒原的。它们俩正瞧着大锅渊，诡谲突然用它那黑黑的发亮的手指指指点点，说道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But -- but," said Puzzle, "wouldn't it be better if you went in? Because, you see, it's you who wants to know what it is, and I don't much. And you've got hands, you see. You're as good as a Man or a Dwarf when it comes to catching hold of things. I've only got hoofs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但——但，”迷惑说，“你如果跳下水去，岂不更好吗？因为，你明白，原是你想知道这是什么东西，我可不大想知道。而且，你瞧，你还生得有手。赶上要抓住什么东西的时候。你像人或小矮人一样管用。我却只有驴蹄儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wanting me to go into the water," said the Ape. "As if you didn't know perfectly well what weak chests Apes always have and how easily they catch cold! Very well. I will go in. I'm feeling cold enough already in this cruel wind. But I'll go in. I shall probably die. Then you'll be sorry." And Shift's voice sounded as if he was just going to burst into tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无非是要我跳到水里去，”无尾猿说道，“倒像是你并不完全明白我们无尾猿的肺部总是很弱，总是容易受寒伤风！好吧l我决意下水去。在这冷酷的风里，我已经感到冷了。可是我决意下水去。我可能会死的。那时你就要懊悔了。”诡谲说话的声音，听上去它快要哭出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please don't, please don't, please don't," said Puzzle, half braying, and half talking. "I never meant anything of the sort, Shift, really I didn't.

<div class="line_en">So Shift promised, and Puzzle went cloppety-clop on his four hoofs round the rocky edge of the Pool to find a place where he could get in. Quite apart from the cold it was no joke getting into that quivering and foaming water, and Puzzle had to stand and shiver for a whole minute before he made up his mind to do it. But then Shift called out from behind him and said: "Perhaps I'd better do it after all, Puzzle." And when Puzzle heard that he said, "No, no. You promised. I'm in now," and in he went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诡谲这就答允了，答应不下水了，于是迷惑的四个蹄子便在大锅渊的石头边缘上笃笃笃笃地走动，要找一个可以下水的地方。且不说寒冷彻骨，进入那颤抖的冒着泡沫的水里可不是闹着玩的，迷惑在下定决心跳进水里去之前，不得不站在那里足足哆嗦了一分钟。但这时诡谲从背后喊道：“也许压根儿还不如我跳进水里去的好！”迷惑听到这话，便说道：“不，不，你答应不下水的。我现在下水了。”它就跳进水里去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A great mass of foam got him in the face and filled his mouth with water and blinded him. Then he went under altogether for a few seconds, and when he came up again he was in quite another part of the Pool. Then the swirl caught him and carried him round and round and faster and faster till it took him right under the waterfall itself, and the force of the water plunged him down, deep down, so that he thought he would never be able to hold his breath till he came up again. And when he had come up and when at last he got somewhere near the thing he was trying to catch, it sailed away from him till it too got under the fall and was forced down to the bottom. When it came up again it was further from him than ever. But at last, when he was almost tired to death, and bruised all over and numb with cold, he succeeded in gripping the thing with his teeth. And out he came carrying it in front of him and getting his front hoofs tangled up in it, for it was as big as a large hearthrug, and it was very heavy and cold and slimy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一大片泡沫冲到迷惑的脸上，使迷惑满嘴是水，眼睛也看不清楚。接着，它下沉了几秒钟，等到它重新冒出水面时，它已经到了深渊的另一部分。游涡卷住了它，带着它转了又转，转得愈来愈快，终于把它冲到了大瀑布的正下方，瀑布的力量压得它往下沉，沉得很深，迷惑认为它在冒出水面之前要屏息静气是无能为力了。当迷惑冒出水面，终于到了靠近那东西的地方，企图抓住它时，它又从迷惑身边漂开去了，它也给冲到了瀑布下方，被压到水底里去了。它重新浮上来时离迷惑更远。但，最后，疲乏得要死、浑身伤痕而且冷得四肢麻木时，迷惑终于成功地用牙齿咬住了这件东西。迷惑爬出深渊，把这件东西放在前面，前蹄伸在它里边，使劲抬起它来，因为这东西很大，像一块火炉前的地毯，而且很重，很冷，很黏滑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He flung it down in front of Shift and stood dripping and shivering and trying to get his breath back. But the Ape never looked at him or asked him how he felt. The Ape was too busy going round and round the Thing and spreading it out and patting it and smelling it. Then a wicked gleam came into his eye and he said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迷惑把这东西丢在诡谲面前的地上，它浑身滴水，格格发抖，竭力缓过气来。但无尾猿却瞧也不瞧它，也不问问它感觉如何。无尾猿忙于绕着这东西打转，把它摊开来，拍拍它，闻闻它。无尾猿眼睛里闪过一星邪恶的亮光，它说道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, it wasn't a Talking Lion," said Shift. "You needn't bother about that. There are no Talking Beasts up beyond the Falls, up in the Western Wild. This skin must have belonged to a dumb, wild lion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，它可不是一头会说人话的狮子。”诡谲说道，“你无需为此自找麻烦。在西部荒原里，越过大瀑布就没有说人话的野兽了。这张毛皮必定是属于一头哑巴野狮子的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as he was alone Shift went shambling along, sometimes on two paws and sometimes on four, till he reached his own tree. Then he swung himself up from branch to branch, chattering and grinning all the time, and went into his little house. He found needle and thread and a big pair of scissors there; for he was a clever Ape and the Dwarfs had taught him how to sew. He put the ball of thread (it was very thick stuff, more like cord than thread) into his mouth so that his cheek bulged out as if he were sucking a big bit of toffee. He held the needle between his lips and took the scissors in his left paw. Then he came down the tree and shambled across to the lion-skin. He squatted down and got to work.</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw at once that the body of the lion-skin would be too long for Puzzle and its neck too short. So he cut a good piece out of the body and used it to make a long collar for Puzzle's long neck. Then he cut off the head and sewed the collar in between the head and the shoulders. He put threads on both sides of the skin so that it would tie up under Puzzle's chest and stomach. Every now and then a bird would pass overhead and Shift would stop his work, looking anxiously up. He did not want anyone to see what he was doing. But none of the birds he saw were Talking Birds, so it didn't matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诡谲立刻看出来了，要给驴子做外套的话，狮子毛皮的躯体部分是太大了，脖子部分又太短了。所以它就从太大的部分剪下一大块来，给驴子的长脖子做一条长长的领子。它把狮子脑袋的毛皮剪下来，在脑袋和肩膀之间的部位上把那长领子缝上去。它把整张狮子毛皮的两边都用线缝上，使驴子外套的胸腹部都得以收紧。时不时鸟儿在它头上飞过，它就停止缝制，焦急地向上张望。它不要任何飞禽走兽看到它正在干什么。但，它看到的鸟儿，没有一只是会说人话的鸟儿，所以它们看到了也没多大关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are unkind, Puzzle," said Shift. "If you're tired what do you think I am? All day long, while you've been having a lovely refreshing walk down the valley, I've been working hard to make you a coat. My paws are so tired I can hardly hold these scissors. And you won't say thank you -and you won't even look at the coat -and you don't care -- and- and-"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迷惑，你太不近人情了，”诡谲道，“如果你累了，你以为我又如何呢？整整一天，你走下山谷作一番赏心悦目、精神为之一振的散步，我却在拼命干活，给你缝制一件外套。我的脚爪搞得那么累，几乎剪刀都拿不住了。如今你却不肯说一声谢谢——甚至不肯对外套看一眼——你不关心——你——你——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear Shift," said Puzzle getting up at once, "I am so sorry. I've been horrid. Of course I'd love to try it on. And it looks simply splendid. Do try it on me at once. Please do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我亲爱的诡谲，”躺着的迷惑立刻站起身来，“我很抱歉。我态度粗暴。我当然喜欢试穿的。外套看上去简直华贵极了。立刻让我穿上试试吧。请让我试穿吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, stand still then," said the Ape. The skin was very heavy for him to lift, but in the end, with a lot of pulling and pushing and puffing and blowing, he got it on to the donkey. He tied it underneath Puzzle's body and he tied the legs to Puzzle's legs and the tail to Puzzle's tail. A good deal of Puzzle's grey nose and face could be seen through the open mouth of the lion's head. No one who had ever seen a real lion would have been taken in for a moment. But if someone who had never seen a lion looked at Puzzle in his lion-skin he just might mistake him for a lion, if he didn't come too close, and if the light was not too good, and if Puzzle didn't let out a bray and didn't make any noise with his hoofs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，那就安安静静地站着。”无尾猿说道。狮子毛皮很重，无尾猿几乎举不动它，但，经过许多拉啊推啊，气喘吁吁啊，它终于把狮皮外套套到驴子身上去了。它把狮子躯体上的毛皮缚在驴子的身体上，把狮腿上的毛皮缚在驴腿上，把狮子尾巴上的毛皮缚在驴子尾巴上。通过狮子脑袋张开嘴巴的毛皮，可以看得见驴子的大部分鼻子和脸孔。凡见过真正的狮子的，没有一个会受骗上当的。然而，如果有谁从未见过狮子，假如他并没走得很近，假使光线不是太好，假如迷惑并不发出驴叫声，并不用蹄子弄出什么声音来，瞧见迷惑穿上了狮子毛皮外套，倒可能把它误认为是狮子。">查看中文翻译</div>

I was just going to say that if the real Aslan, as you call him, meant us to go on with this, he would send us a thunderclap and an earth-tremor. It was just on the tip of my tongue, only the sign itself came before I could get the words out. You've got to do it now, Puzzle. And please don't let us have any more arguing.
