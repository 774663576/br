<div class="line_en">By and by Aleck subscribed to a Chicago daily and for the WALL STREET POINTER. With an eye single to finance she studied these as diligently all the week as she studied her Bible Sundays. Sally was lost in admiration, to note with what swift and sure strides her genius and judgment developed and expanded in the forecasting and handling of the securities of both the material and spiritual markets. He was proud of her nerve and daring in exploiting worldly stocks, and just as proud of her conservative caution in working her spiritual deals. He noted that she never lost her head in either case; that with a splendid courage she often went short on worldly futures, but heedfully drew the line there -- she was always long on the others. Her policy was quite sane and simple, as she explained it to him: what she put into earthly futures was for speculation, what she put into spiritual futures was for investment; she was willing to go into the one on a margin, and take chances, but in the case of the other, "margin her no margins" -- she wanted to cash in a hundred cents per dollar's worth, and have the stock transferred on the books.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a great day for the pair of Fosters. They were speechless for joy. Also speechless for another reason: after much watching of the market, Aleck had lately, with fear and trembling, made her first flyer on a "margin," using the remaining twenty thousand of the bequest in this risk. In her mind's eye she had seen it climb, point by point -- always with a chance that the market would break -- until at last her anxieties were too great for further endurance -- she being new to the margin business and unhardened, as yet -- and she gave her imaginary broker an imaginary order by imaginary telegraph to sell. She said forty thousand dollars' profit was enough. The sale was made on the very day that the coal venture had returned with its rich freight. As I have said, the couple were speechless. they sat dazed and blissful that night, trying to realize that they were actually worth a hundred thousand dollars in clean, imaginary cash. Yet so it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是福斯特夫妇大喜的日子。他们都高兴得说不出话来了。说不出话来的另一个原因是：在细细观察市场之后，艾莱柯战战兢兢地用遗产中剩余的两万块钱冒险炒了一把。在想像中，她眼看着手里的股票一个点又一个点地往上涨——伴随着股市每时每刻都可能暴跌的风险——最后，她的精神压力太大，再这样下去实在承受不住了——她做这种冒险生意还是新手，心太软——于是，她用想像中的电报给想像中的经纪人发出一个想像中的指令，让他抛出。她说四万块钱的赚头已经够多了。抛出这笔股票，恰逢煤矿的投资给他们返回丰厚利润的那一天。正如我方才讲到的，这夫妻俩说不出话来了。那天夜里他们大喜过望、如醉如痴，极力想意识到一件了不起的大事，那就是这笔财富——想像中的现款——实际上净值十万。实打实的十万。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took but a very few months to educate Aleck's imagination and Sally's. Each day's training added something to the spread and effectiveness of the two machines. As a consequence, Aleck made imaginary money much faster than at first she had dreamed of making it, and Sally's competency in spending the overflow of it kept pace with the strain put upon it, right along. In the beginning, Aleck had given the coal speculation a twelvemonth in which to materialize, and had been loath to grant that this term might possibly be shortened by nine months. But that was the feeble work, the nursery work, of a financial fancy that had had no teaching, no experience, no practice. These aids soon came, then that nine months vanished, and the imaginary ten-thousand-dollar investment came marching home with three hundred per cent. profit on its back!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过几个月，艾莱柯和萨利的想像力就培养起来了。每日的训练开拓了这两部机器的活动范围，提高了效率。结果，艾莱柯在想像中赚钱的速度比开始时设想的快得多，萨利和她比翼齐飞，花富余钱的本领也与日俱增。开始时，艾莱柯把投资煤矿的收益期定为十二个月，她对这个期限也许会缩短为九个月的问题不予考虑。可那只是还没启蒙时的小儿科，是在金融方面未经指导、没有经验和缺乏实践的花拳绣腿。不久她就开了窍，九个月的期限消失了，那笔想像中的一万块钱投资翻了三倍后阔步归来。利润凯旋了！">查看中文翻译</div>
