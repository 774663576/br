<div class="line_en">Peter Clemenza slept badly that night. In the morning he got up early and made his own breakfast of a glass of grappa, a thick slice of Genoa salami with a chunk of fresh Italian bread that was still delivered to his door as in the old days. Then he drank a great, plain china mug filled with hot coffee that had been lashed with anisette. But as he padded about the house in his old bathrobe and red felt slippers he pondered on the day's work that lay ahead of him. Last night Sonny Corleone had made it very clear that Paulie Gatto was to be taken care of immediately. It had to be today.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza was troubled. Not because Gatto had been his protege and had turned traitor. This did not reflect on the caporegime's judgment. After all, Paulie's background had been perfect. He came from a Sicilian family, he had grown up in the same neighborhood as the Corleone children, had indeed even gone to school with one of the sons. He had been brought up through each level in the proper manner. He had been tested and not found wanting. And then after he had "made his bones" he had received a good living from the Family, a percentage of an East Side "book" and a union payroll slot. Clemenza had not been unaware that Paulie Gatto 'supplemented his income with free-lance stickups, strictly against the Family rules, but even this was a sign of the man's worth. The breaking of such regulations was considered a sign of high-spiritedness, like that shown by a fine racing horse fighting the reins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎感到左右为难，这倒不是因为嘎吐原来是他的门生，也并不因此而说明这位司令没有眼力。随便说到哪里，鲍里的出身是无懈可击的。他出身于西西里家庭。他同考利昂家的孩子从小是在一起长大的，而且还同考利昂家的一个儿子是同学。他成长的第一个阶段都没有毛病。他曾经被考验过，也没有发现什么不足之处。然后当他经过了“过硬的考验”之后，他就靠考利昂家族的资助过上了好生活，定期从东岸“账本”得到补助，还在协会饷金名单上占有了一个位置。但克莱门扎一直不知道鲍里·嘎吐在外面当雇佣游勇，用额外得来的高工资贴补他的收入。这是绝对违反家族规章制度的，但这也说明了这个人的品质。破坏这样的规章制度的行为被认为是精力旺盛的表现，就像优秀的赛马想挣脱复绳所表现出来的那种精力充沛的劲头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Paulie had never caused trouble with his stickups. They had always been meticulously planned and carried out with the minimum of fuss and trouble, with no one ever getting hurt: a three-thousand-dollar Manhattan garment center payroll, a small chinaware factory payroll in the slums of Brooklyn. After all, a young man could always use some extra pocket money. It was all in the pattern. Who could ever foretell that Paulie Gatto would turn traitor?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从另一方面讲，鲍里从来没有因为额外得来的高工资而引起过什么麻烦。捞取额外收入的活动一直是经过精心计划的，干得不声不响，稳稳当当，也不伤害任何人。曼哈顿服装中心饷金名单上有他的三千美元，在布鲁克林贫民区瓷器厂饷金名单上也有一笔小数目。随便怎么说，年轻人口袋里多有些钱用，这也是可以的，是合乎规矩的。可是谁料到鲍里·嘎吐有朝一日会变成叛徒？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was troubling Peter Clemenza this morning was an administrative problem. The actual execution of Gatto was a cut-and-dried chore. The problem was, who should the caporegime bring up from the ranks to replace Gatto in the Family? It was an important promotion, that to "button" man, one not to be handed out lightly. The man had to be tough and he had to be smart. He had to be safe, not a person who would talk to the police if he got in trouble, one well saturated in the Sicilians' law of omerta, the law of silence. And then, what kind of a living would he receive for his new duties? Clemenza had several times spoken to the Don about better rewards for the all-important button man who was first in the front line when trouble arose, but the Don had put him off. If Paulie had been making more money, he might have been able to resist the blandishments of the wily Turk, Sollozzo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使彼得·克莱门扎感到伤脑筋的是人员调配问题。对嘎吐的处决，倒普通得像家常便饭。问题是在家族组织系统中，司令从基层人员中提拔谁来接替嘎吐呢？这是重大晋升，不能随便送给哪个“勤杂工”。要提拔的必须是坚强不屈、精明能干、忠实可靠的人，不要那种一旦出了问题就说出真情的软骨头，而要那种受过西西里人的“哑巴”法即保密法的充分熏陶的好汉。此外，还有个问题，接受了新任务之后又该享受什么样的待遇呢？克莱门扎曾好几次向老头子建议过，建议对在出了麻烦时第一次上前线的关键的勤杂人员提高奖金，但是老头子没有同意。要是鲍里拿到的奖金多一点，他很可能拒绝那个诡计多端的“土耳其人”索洛佐的利诱拉拢。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Clemenza finally narrowed down the list of candidates to three men. The first was an enforcer who worked with the colored policy bankers in Harlem, a big brawny brute of a man of great physical strength, a man with a great deal of personal charm who could get along with people and yet when necessary make them go in fear of him. But Clemenza scratched him off the list after considering his name for a half hour. This man got along too well with the black people, which hinted at some flaw of character. Also he would be too hard to replace in the position he now held.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎进行了一番淘汰，候选人名单上最后只剩下三个了。第一个是流氓集团内部维持黑纪律的执法人。他同哈莱姆分区的几个黑人彩票庄家一道活动，是个力大如牛的大汉，为人随和，具有同群众搞好关系的魅力，但有时会把人家搞得都怕他。克莱门扎在把他的名字考虑了半个小时之后就划掉了。原因是此人同黑人来往过于频繁，这就间接说明他人格上有污点。还有，他的职位空下来之后要另找人顶替也是困难的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second name Clemenza considered and almost settled on was a hard-working chap who served faithfully and well in the organization. This man was the collector of delinquent accounts for Family-licensed shylocks in Manhattan. He had started off as a bookmaker's runner. But he was not quite yet ready for such an important promotion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎考虑的第二个名字，是一个在组织系统中工作干得很出色的小伙子。他是曼哈顿区持有考利昂家族执照的向放债者催帐的收款员。他是给赌注登记人当跑脚的。而要得到如此重大的提拔，显然条件还不十分成熟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally he settled on Rocco Lampone. Lampone had served a short but impressive apprenticeship in the Family. During the war he had been wounded in Africa and been discharged in 1943. Because of the shortage of young men, Clemenza had taken him on even though Lampone was partially incapacitated by his injuries and walked with a pronounced limp. Clemenza had used him as a black-market contact in the garment center and with government employees controlling OPA food stamps. From that, Lampone had graduated to trouble-shooter for the whole operation. What Clemenza liked about him was his good judgment. He knew that there was no percentage in being tough about something that would only cost a heavy fine or six months in jail, small prices to pay for the enormous profits earned. He had the good sense to know that it was not an area for heavy threats but light ones. He kept the whole operation in a minor key, which was exactly what was needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他看中了罗科·拉朋。拉朋在家族系统中当学徒，时间虽短但表现很出色。战争中，他在非洲负过伤，走起路来明显地有点瘸。克莱门扎让他在黑市上联系，他经常到服装中心串串，同物价管理局管食品印花税的政府官员打交道。经过这类具体工作的锻炼，拉朋出脱得很能干，成了这一行当中解决麻烦问题的能手。克莱门扎特别欣赏的就是他准确的判断力。拉朋明白对某个问题一味蛮横固执，到头来要么是钱财上受重罚，要么是刑事上被判坐牢六个月，辛苦赚来的大利还得付出一点代价。他很有自知之明：干他这一行是不宜肆无忌惮地使用威胁手段的。只宜适可而止地用用威胁手段。他处理自己负责的整个系统的问题一向是采用低调，这也正好合乎需要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza felt the relief of a conscientious administrator who has solved a knotty personnel problem. Yes, it would be Rocco Lampone who would assist. For Clemenza planned to handle this job himself, not only to help a new, inexperienced man "make his bones," but to settle a personal score with Paulie Gatto. Paulie had been his protege, he had advanced Paulie over the heads of more deserving and more loyal people, he had helped Paulie "make his bones" and furthered his career in every way. Paulie had not only betrayed the Family, he had betrayed his padrone, Peter Clemenza. This lack of respect had to be repaid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎感到一阵轻松，一个行政人员在解决了一个棘手的人事安排问题之后所会感到的那种轻松。是的，适合当助手的就是罗科·拉朋。克莱门扎打算亲自出马处理这个问题，不光是为了帮助一个没有经验的生手经历“过硬的考验”，也是为了同鲍里·嘎吐算个人之间的一笔帐。鲍里一直是他的门生；他从前越级提拔了他，把许多更有资格、更忠诚的人都越过去了；他曾经帮助鲍里经历“过硬的考验”，并千方百计提携他。而今天，鲍里不但背叛了家族，也背叛了他的恩师彼得·克莱门扎。这种不自爱的行为必须加以清算。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything else was arranged. Paulie Gatto had been instructed to pick him up at three in the afternoon, and to pick him up with his own car, nothing hot. Now Clemenza took up the telephone and dialed Rocco Lampone's number. He did not identify himself. He simply said, "Come to my house, I have an errand for you." He was pleased to note that despite the early hour, Lampone's voice was not surprised or dazed with sleep and he simply said, "OK." Good man. Clemenza added, "No rush, have your breakfast and lunch first before you come see me. But not later than two in the afternoon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都安排好了。鲍里·嘎吐接到命令，下午三点有汽车来接他，没有什么要紧的事。现在，克莱门扎拿起电话，拨了罗科·拉朋的电话号码。他并没有说自己是谁，只简单地说：“到我家来，我有个任务向你交待。”克莱门扎听到拉朋的声音很愉快，尽管是大清早，也听得出他并没有因为突然接到电话而惊慌，也没有因为睡意尚浓而昏昏迷迷。他回答得很干脆：“好吧。”“好小子！”克莱门扎补充说，“别慌，吃过中饭再找我。但是，不要迟于下午两点钟。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He decided to wash his Cadillac. He loved the car. It gave him such a quiet peaceful ride, and its upholstery was so rich that he sometimes sat in it for an hour when the weather was good because it was more pleasant than sitting in the house. And it always helped him think when he was grooming the car. He remembered his father in Italy doing the same thing with donkeys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他决定洗洗自己的“卡迪拉克”牌汽车。他爱这种牌子的汽车，坐在这种车子里，听不到噪音，感到很平稳，车内装潢也很考究。天气好的时候，他就要在里面坐上一小时，因为坐在车里比坐在家里舒服得多。每当他清洗汽车时，总是浮想联翩：想到他父亲当年在意大利也是这时候这样精心收拾驴子的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was another laconic OK on the other end and Clemenza hung up the phone. He had already alerted his people about replacing caporegime Tessio's people in the Corleone mall so that was done. He had capable subordinates and never interfered in a mechanical operation of that kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电话里又传来了一声简明扼要的“好吧”，克莱门扎便挂上了电话。他早已通知他的人集中到考利昂林荫道去接替忒希奥的人，现在已经照办了，他有的是精明能干的助手。在这类活动中，他从来不直接插手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Clemenza worked inside the heated garage, he hated cold. He ran over his plans. You had to be careful with Paulie, the man was like a rat, he could smell danger. And now of course despite being so tough he must be shitting in his pants because the old man was still alive. He'd be as skittish as a donkey with ants up his ass.

<div class="line_en">Of course, strictly speaking, this was not necessary. Paulie Gatto could be killed without any of these frills. He was locked in, he could not run away. But Clemenza felt strongly that it was important to keep good working habits and never give away a fraction of a percentage point. You never could tell what might happen and these matters were, after all, questions of life and death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，严格讲，这样小心完全是不必要的，完全用不着这一套故弄玄虚的做法，就可能轻而易举把鲍里·嘎吐干掉。他已是瓮中之鳖，想逃也逃不脱了。但克莱门扎强烈地感到，保持良好的工作习惯是很重要的，一定要做到万无一失。这些问题毕竟是有关生死的问题，中途会出现什么意外，你无法预料。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he washed his baby-blue Cadillac, Peter Clemenza pondered and rehearsed his lines, the expressions of his face. He would be curt with Paulie, as if displeased with him. With a man so sensitive and suspicious as Gatto this would throw him off the track or at least leave him uncertain. Undue friendliness would make him wary. But of course the curtness must not be too angry. It had to be rather an absentminded sort of irritation. And why Lampone? Paulie would find that most alarming, especially since Lampone had to be in the rear seat. Paulie wouldn't like being helpless at the wheel with Lampone behind his head. Clemenza rubbed and polished the metal of his Cadillac furiously. It was going to be tricky. Very tricky. For a moment he debated whether to recruit another man but decided against it. Here he followed basic reasoning. In years to come a situation might arise where it might be profitable for one of his partners to testify against him. If there were just one accomplice it was one's word against the other. But the word of a second accomplice could swing the balance. No, they would stick to procedure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得·克莱门扎一面冲洗自己的淡蓝色汽车，一面思考自己要说的话，预习自己要表演的面部表情。他打算对鲍里粗暴无理。好像是生了他的气的样子。对于像鲍里·嘎吐这样敏感而多疑的人来说，这一下就可能使他摸不着头脑。故作姿态的客气倒可能使他提防起来。但是，当然罗，所谓的粗暴也绝不能表现为过分的大发雷霆。要表现为一种漫不经心的随便发发小脾气。为什么拉朋也来了？对这一点，鲍里一定感到吃惊，尤其是拉朋必须坐在后座，就更会使鲍里疑心。鲍里自己坐在司机座位，让拉朋坐在他的背后，鲍里就会感到万一发生意外，他行动起来就碍手碍脚。克莱门扎把“卡迪拉克”牌汽车刮呀擦呀，心里很烦闷。这问题真棘手，非常棘手。他一度反复地考虑究竟要不要另外物色一个人，但后来又打消了这个念头。在这个问题上他遵循的是基本推理方法。在若干年后，局势可能发生变化，他的同事中可能有一个人为了自己的利益而提出证据来反对他。如果只有一个同伙，那么即使他起来，结果势必是非难辨。但如果有第二个同伙在场，他的证词就可能定夺。不能马虎，他还得严格按照程序办事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What annoyed Clemenza was that the execution had to be "public." That is, the body was to be found. He would have much preferred having it disappear. (Usual burying grounds were the nearby ocean or the swamplands of New Jersey on land owned by friends of the Family or by other more complicated methods.) But it had to be public so that embryo traitors would be frightened and the enemy warned that the Corleone Family had by no means gone stupid or soft. Sollozzo would be made wary by this quick discovery of his spy. The Corleone Family would win back some of its prestige. It had been made to look foolish by the shooting of the old man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使克莱门扎感到伤脑筋的是执行结果必须“公开”，也就是说，要让尸体给人发现。他宁愿把尸体处理得让人发现不了。（通常埋人的地方就是附近的大洋，或考利昂家族的朋友或其他更间接的人在新泽西州所拥有的沼泽地带。）但是，尸体必须公开，目的是让潜在的叛徒受到威慑，同时也给敌人提出警告，让他们明白考利昂家族绝对没有变得昏聩无能、软弱可欺。一方面索洛佐知道自己收买的内奸就如此迅速地被发现了，会警觉起来，另一方面考利昂家族也会挽回威信上的损失。老头子遭枪击一事使考利昂家族显得有点庸庸碌碌，无所作为。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever a war between the Families became bitterly intense, the opponents would set up headquarters in secret apartments where the "soldiers" could sleep on mattresses scattered through the rooms. This was not so much to keep their families out of danger, their wives and little children, since any attack on noncombatants was undreamed of. All parties were too vulnerable to similar retaliation. But it was always smarter to live in some secret place where your everyday movements could not be charted either by your opponents or by some police who might arbitrarily decide to meddle.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so usually a trusted caporegime would be sent out to rent a secret apartment and fill it with mattresses. That apartment would be used as a sally port into the city when an offensive was mounted. It was natural for Clemenza to be sent on such an errand. It was natural for him to take Gatto and Lampone with him to arrange all the details, including the furnishing of the apartment. Also, Clemenza thought with a grin, Paulie Gatto had proved he was greedy and the first thought that would pop into his head was how much he could get from Sollozzo for this valuable intelligence.</div>

Lampone shifted dutifully, so that he was sitting behind Clemenza, as if such a request was the most natural thing in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个像白鼬的侍从全神贯注地注视着他，好像在找什么线索似的。拉朋上车坐在他的后面。他畏缩了一下，说：“罗科，往那边靠一靠。你这大块头把我后视镜的光线全遮住了。”拉朋服服贴贴地挪了一下，坐在克莱门扎的后面，好像嘎吐提出这样一个要求是世界上最自然不过的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he had expected, Gatto's eyes became greedily interested. Paulie had swallowed the bait and because he was thinking how much the information was worth to Sollozzo, he was forgetting to think about whether he was in danger. Also, Lampone was acting his part perfectly, staring out the window in a disinterested, relaxed way. Clemenza congratulated himself on his choice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如他所料，嘎吐眼睛表现出了如饥似渴的兴趣。鲍里·嘎吐已经上钩了，因为他这会儿想的是这个情报对索洛佐多么有价值，却忘记了他本人是否已经陷于危险之中。另外，拉朋也表演得到家了。他瞧着窗外，显得无所事事、懒洋洋的样子。克莱门扎对自己决定的人选很满意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Clemenza said sourly to Gatto, "Damn that Sonny, he's running scared. He's already thinking of going to the mattresses. We have to find a place on the West Side. Paulie, you and Rocco gotta staff and supply it until the word comes down for the rest of the soldiers to use it. You know a good location?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Paulie was an expert driver and traffic going into the city was light at this time in the afternoon, so the early winter darkness was just beginning to fall when they arrived. There was no small talk in the car. Clemenza directed Paulie to drive up to the Washington Heights section. He checked a few apartment buildings and told him to park near Arthur Avenue and wait. He also left Rocco Lampone in the car. He went into the Vera Mario Restaurant and had a light dinner of veal and salad, nodding his hellos to some acquaintances. After an hour had gone by he walked the several blocks to where the car was parked and entered it. Gatto and Lampone were still waiting. "Shit," Clemenza said, "they want us back in Long Beach. They got some other job for us now. Sonny says we can let this one go until later. Rocco, you live in the city, can we drop you off?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Again on the ride back to Long Beach nothing was said. On the stretch of road that led into the city, Clemenza said suddenly, "Paulie, pull over, I gotta take a leak." From working together so long, Gatto knew the fat caporegime had a weak bladder. He had often made such a request. Gatto pulled the car off the highway onto the soft earth that led to the swamp. Clemenza climbed out of the car and took a few steps into the bushes. He actually relieved himself. Then as he opened the door to get back into the car he took a quick look up and down the highway. There were no lights, the road was completely dark. "Go ahead," Clemenza said. A second later the interior of the car reverberated with the report of a gun. Paulie Gatto seemed to jump forward, his body flinging against the steering wheel and then slumping over to the seat. Clemenza had stepped back hastily to avoid being hit with fragments of skull bone and blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在折回长滩镇的路上，他们都没有说什么话。在回市区的路上，克莱门扎突然说：“鲍里，停停，我要小便。”由于长期在一起工作，嘎吐知道这个大胖子司令一有尿就想小便。他常常提出这样的要求。鲍里把汽车一偏，离开了公路，开到了通向沼泽的松软的土路上。克莱门扎下了汽车，向着草丛走了几步，真的解了个小手。当他回头打开车门要上车的时候，他迅速地向公路的前前后后打量了一下。公路上没有灯，一片漆黑。“开始吧！”克莱门扎说。一秒钟以后，车内响起了枪声。鲍里·嘎吐好像是朝前扑了一下，身子先是撞在方向盘上，然后一下子瘫在椅子上；克莱门扎猛地往后退了几步，怕头盖骨碎片和血点溅在他身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rocco Lampone scrambled out of the back seat. He still held the gun and he threw it into the swamp. He and Clemenza walked hastily to a car parked nearby and got in. Lampone reached underneath the seat and found the key that had been left for them. He started the car and drove Clemenza to his home. Then instead of going back by the same route, he took the Jones Beach Causeway right on through to the town of Merrick and onto the Meadowbrook Parkway until he reached the Northern State Parkway. He rode that to the Long Island Expressway and then continued on to the Whitestone Bridge and through the Bronx to his home in Manhattan.</div>
