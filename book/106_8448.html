<div class="line_en">Where was she?</div>

<div class="line_en">He had called at seven, then at eight-thirty, and now he checked his watch again. Nine forty-five.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lon shook his head and leaned back in his chair. He was the last one in the office, as usual, and everything was quiet. But that was normal with an ongoing trial, even if the trial was going well. Law was his passion, and the late hours alone gave him the opportunity to catch up on his work without interruption.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lon hung up the phone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew she was where she had said she would be because he had spoken to the manager earlier. Yes, she had checked in and he had last seen her around six. Going to dinner, he thought. No, he hadn't seen her since.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the more important part of his success came from hard work. He had always paid attention to details, especially when he'd begun his practice. Little things, obscure things, and it had become a habit now. Whether it was a matter of law or presentation, he was diligent in his study, and it had won him a few cases early in his career when he should have lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew he would win the case because he mastered the law and charmed the jury. He always did, and losses were infrequent now. Part of it came from being able to select the cases he had the expertise to win. He had reached that level in his practice. Only a select few in the city had that kind of stature, and his earnings reflected that.</div>

<div class="line_en">But damn, he couldn't put his finger on it. He was fine when she'd left this morning. At least he thought he was. But sometime after her call, maybe an hour or so, something clicked in his mind. The little detail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her trip was good, she had checked in, had done some shopping. Left her number. That's about all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that was it, he was sure now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Detail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something… something… something said? Something had been said? Yes, that was it. He knew it. But what was it? Had Allie said anything on the phone? That had been when it started, and he ran through the conversation again. No, nothing out of the ordinary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His mind clicked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something insignificant? Something important? Think… think… Damn, what was it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now, a little detail bothered him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What had she said?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought about her then. He loved her, he was sure of that. Not only was she beautiful and charming, but she'd become his source of stability and best friend as well. After a hard day at work, she was the first person he would call. She would listen to him, laugh at the right moments, and had a sixth sense about what he needed to hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not about the case. No, that was fine. It was something else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something about Allie.</div>

<div class="line_en">But more than that, he admired the way she'd always spoken her mind. He remembered that after they'd gone out a few times, he'd said to her what he said to all women he dated -- that he wasn't ready for a steady relationship. Unlike the others, though, Allie had simply nodded and said, "Fine." But on her way out the door, she'd turned and said: "But your problem isn't me, or your job, or your freedom, or whatever else you think it is. Your problem is that you're alone. Your father made the Hammond name famous, and you've probably been compared to him all your life. You've never been your own person. A life like that makes you empty inside, and you're looking for someone who will magically fill that void. But no one can do that but you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The words had stayed with him that night and rung true the following morning. He'd called again, asked for a second chance, and after some persistence, she'd reluctantly agreed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the four years they'd dated, she'd become everything he ever wanted, and he knew he should spend more time with her. But practicing law made limiting his hours impossible. She'd always understood, but still, he cursed himself for not making the time. Once he was married, he'd shorten his hours, he promised himself. He'd have his secretary check his schedule to make sure he wasn't overextending himself…</div>

<div class="line_en">New Bern, he thought again, and knew the name. Knew the town a little, mainly from a few trials he had been in. Stopped there a few times on the way to the coast. Nothing special. He and Allie had never been there together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Check… checking… checking in?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked to the ceiling. Checking in?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie, New Bern… and… and… something at a party. A comment in passing. From Allie's mother. He'd hardly noticed it. But what had she said?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">C'mon, don't fail now. Think, damn it, think. New Bern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And his mind clicked another notch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thought popped into his head just then. Yes, New Bern. That was it. The little detail, or part of it. What else, though?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Allie had been there before…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was something about Allie being in love one time with a young man from New Bern. Called it puppy love. So what, he had thought when he'd heard it, and had turned to smile at Allie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Lon paled then, remembering. Remembering what had been said so long ago. Remembering what Allie's mother had said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, that was it. He closed his eyes and thought for a second. No. Nothing. What, then?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the rack tightened its grip, another part coming together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another part… but there was more…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Check?…</div>

<div class="line_en">Lon brought his palms together, as though he were praying, resting them against his lips. Coincidence? Could be nothing. Could be exactly what she said. Could be stress and antique shopping. Possible. Even probable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lon considered the other possibility, and for the first time in a long time, he became frightened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet… yet… what if?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What if? What if she's with him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she hadn't smiled. She was angry. And then Lon guessed that she had loved that person far more deeply than her mother had suggested. Maybe even more deeply than she loved him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He cursed the trial, wishing it were over. Wishing he had gone with her. Wondering if she'd told him the truth, hoping that she had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now she was there. Interesting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, with trembling hands, he dialed the phone for the fourth and last time that evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he made up his mind then not to lose her. He would do anything it took to keep her. She was everything he'd always needed, and he'd never find another quite like her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And again there was no answer.</div>
