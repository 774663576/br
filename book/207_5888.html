<div class="line_en">"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."</div>

<div class="line_en">Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a. m. Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-bye?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All right," and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行啊，行啊！”那人回答。车门关上了，“好啦，”一声大叫，我们便上路了。就这样我告别了贝茜和盖茨黑德，一阵风似地被卷往陌生的、当时看来遥远和神秘的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the "stony street" of L --.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一路行程，我已记得不多。只知道那天长得出奇，而且似乎赶了几百里路。我们经过几个城镇，在其中很大的一个停了下来。车夫卸了马，让乘客们下车吃饭。我被带进一家客找，护车人要我吃些中饭，我却没有胃口，他便扔下我走了，让我留在—个巨大无比的房间里，房间的两头都有一个火炉，天花板上悬挂着一盏枝形吊灯，高高的墙上有一个小小的红色陈列窗，里面放满了乐器。我在房间里来回走了很久，心里很不自在，害怕有人会进来把我拐走。我相信确有拐子，他们所干的勾当常常出现在贝茜火炉旁所讲的故事中。护车人终于回来了，我再次被塞进马车，我的保护人登上座位，吹起了闷声闷气的号角，车子一阵丁当，驶过了Ｌ镇的“石子街”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那声音仿佛像催眠曲，我终于倒头睡着了。没过多久，车子突然停了下来，我被惊醒了。马车的门开着，一个仆人模样的人站在门边。藉着灯光，我看得清她的面容和衣装。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked. I answered "Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.</div>

<div class="line_en">The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午，天气潮湿，雾气迷蒙。白昼溶入黄昏时，我开始感到离开盖茨黑德真的很远了。我们再也没有路过城镇，乡村的景色也起了变化，一座座灰色的大山耸立在地平线上。暮色渐浓，车子驶进一个山谷，那里长着黑乎乎一片森林。夜幕遮盖了一切景物之后很久，我听见狂风在林中呼啸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house or houses -- for the building spread far -- with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为久坐，我身子都发僵了，马车的喧声和震动弄得我迷迷糊糊，我定下神来，环顾左右。只见雨在下，风在刮，周围一片黑暗。不过我隐约看到面前有一堵墙，墙上有一扇门，新来的向导领我进去，把门关上，随手上了锁。这时看得见一间，也许是几间房子，因为那建筑物铺展得很开，上面有很多窗子，其中几扇里亮着灯。我们踏上一条水沫飞溅的宽阔石子路，后来又进了一扇门。接着仆人带我穿过一条过道，进了一个生着火的房间，撇下我走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位刚离开的小姐约摸二十九岁，跟我一起走的那位比她略小几岁，前者的腔调、目光和神态给我印象很深，而米勒小姐比较平淡无奇，显得身心交瘁，但面色却还红润。她的步态和动作十分匆忙，仿佛手头总有忙不完的事情。说真的好看上去像个助理教师，后来我发现果真如此，我被她领着在一个形状不规则的大楼里，走过一个又一个房间，穿过一条又一条过道，这些地方都是那么悄无声息，甚至还有几分凄切。后来我们突然听到嗡嗡的嘈杂的人声，顷刻之间便走进了一个又阔又长的房间，两头各摆着两张大木板桌。每张桌子上点着两支蜡烛，一群年龄在九岁、十岁到二十岁之间的姑娘，围着桌子坐在长凳上。在昏暗的烛光下，我感到她们似乎多得难以计数，尽管实际上不会超过八十人。她们清一色地穿着式样古怪的毛料上衣，系着长长的亚麻细布围涎。那正是学习时间，他们正忙于默记第二天的功课，我所听的的嗡嗡之声，正是集体小声读书所发出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed me along with Miss Miller.</div>

The portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shaved into fragments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高个子姑娘们走了出去，很快又回来了，每人端了个大盘子， 盘子里放着一份份不知什么东西，中间是一大罐水和一只大杯子。那一份份东西都分发了出去，高兴喝水的人还喝了口水，那大杯子是公用的。轮到我的时候，因为口渴，我喝了点水、但没有去碰食品，激动和疲倦已使我胃口全无。不过我倒是看清楚了，那是一个薄薄的燕麦饼，平均分成了几小块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I was to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完饭，米勒小姐念了祷告，各班鱼贯而出，成双成对走上楼梯。这时我己经疲惫不堪，几乎没有注意到寝室的模样，只看清了它像教室一样很长。今晚我同米勒小姐同睡一张床，她帮我脱掉衣服，并让我躺下。这时我瞥了一眼一长排一长排床，每张床很快睡好了两个人，十分钟后那仅有的灯光也熄灭了，在寂静无声与一片漆黑中，我沉沉睡去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!" When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着引起了一阵几分钟的大骚动，米勒小姐反复叫喊着：“不要作声！”“遵守秩序！”喧闹声平息下来之后，我看到她们排成了四个半园形，站在四把椅子前面，这四把椅子分别放在四张桌子旁边。每人手里都拿着书，有一本《圣经》模样的大书，搁在空椅子跟前的每张桌子上。几秒钟肃静之后，响起了低沉而含糊的嗡嗡声，米勒小姐从—个班兜到另一个班，把这种模糊的喧声压下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The night passed rapidly. I was too tired even to dream; I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out --</div>

The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered --</div>

Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.

Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.

Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple -- Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.</div>

<div class="line_en">The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.</div>

I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house -- a large building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription: --</div>

I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title -- it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive.

<div class="line_en">But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day's fare would be like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这时候吃饭铃响了，大家再次进屋去，弥漫在餐厅里的气味并行比早餐时扑鼻而来的味儿更诱人。午餐盛放在两十大白铁桶里，热腾腾冒出一股臭肥肉的气味。我发现这乱糟糟的东西，是烂土豆和几小块不可思议的臭肉搅在一起煮成的，每个学生都分到了相当满的一盘。我尽力而吃。心里暗自纳闷，是否每天的饭食都是这付样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl -- she looked thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. "How can she bear it so quietly -- so firmly?" I asked of myself. "Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment -- beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams -- is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it -- her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is -- whether good or naughty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午只有一件事引人注目，我看到了在游廊上跟我交谈过的姑娘丢了脸，被斯卡查德小姐逐出历史课，责令站在那个大教室当中，在我看来，这种惩罚实在是奇耻大辱，特别是对像她这样一个大姑娘来说——她看上去有十三岁了，或许还更大，我猜想她会露出伤心和害臊的表情。但使我诧异的是，她既没哭泣，也没脸红，她在众目睽睽之下，站在那里，虽然神情严肃，却非常镇定。“她怎么能那么默默地而又坚定地忍受呢？”我暗自思忖。“要是我，巴不得地球会裂开，把我吞下去。而她看上去仿佛在想惩罚之外的什么事，与她处境无关的事情，某种既不在她周围也不在她眼的的东西，我听说过白日梦、难道她在做白日梦，她的眼晴盯着地板，但可以肯定她视而不见，她的目光似乎是向内的，直视自己的心扉。我想她注视着记忆中的东西，而不是眼前确实存在的事物、我不明白她属于哪一类姑娘，好姑娘，还是淘气鬼。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after five p. m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more -- I was still hungry. Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟刚过，我们又用了另一顿饭，吃的是一小杯咖啡和半片黑面包。我狼吞虎咽地吃了面包，喝了咖啡，吃得津津有味，不过要是能再来一份，我会非常高兴，因为我仍然很饿，吃完饭后是半小时的娱乐活动，然后是学习，再后是一杯水，一个燕麦饼，祷告，上床，这就是我在罗沃德第一天的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
