<div class="line_en">A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant. Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly -- a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control -- the setting sun.</div>

When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，在山脚下还留着一片破落的田野，粗犷而赤裸。山下有一个小小的村庄，村子那边一片开阔地连着个缓坡，有一个教堂尖塔、一个风磨、一片有猎林，还有一片峭壁，壁顶有一座用作监狱的碉堡。夜色渐浓，候爵带着快要到家的神色望了望四周逐渐暗淡的景物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="村子只有一条贫穷的街道，街上有贫穷的酒厂、贫穷的硝皮作坊、贫穷的客栈、贫穷的驿马站、贫穷的泉水和贫穷的设施。它的人也贫穷，全都十分贫穷。许多人坐在门口切着不多的几头洋葱之类，准备晚饭。许多人在泉水边洗菜、洗草、洗大地所能生长的这类能吃的小产品。标志着他们贫困的根源的东西并不难见到。小村里的堂皇文告要求向国家交税、向教堂交税、向老爷交税、向地区交税，还要交些一般的税。这里要交，那里要交，小小的村落竟然还没有被吃光，反倒令人惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court -- only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate -- when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="侯爵大人目光落到低垂在他面前的一片驯顺的面孔上，那些面孔跟他自己在宫廷的大人面前低首敛眉时的样子颇有些相像——只是有一点不同，这些面孔低了下来是准备受苦而不是为了赎罪。这时一个花白头发的补路工来到了人群前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions' whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him. He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由流星报马和驭手叭叭的鞭声开着道（那鞭子游蛇一样旋卷在他们头顶的夜色中），侯爵的旅行马车来到了驿站大门，仿佛有复仇女神随侍。驿站就在泉水边不远，农民们停下活儿望着他；他也看看他们，虽然看到，却没有感觉到那些受到细水长流的痛苦磨损的面孔与人形。这类形象在英国人心目中形成了一种迷信：法国人总是瘦削憔悴的。而这种迷信在那类实际情况消失之后差不多一百年还存在着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect -- Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看不到几个孩子。狗是没有的。至于男子汉和妇女，他们在世上的路已由景色作了交代——或是在风磨之下的村子里依靠最低条件苟延残喘，或是关进悬崖顶上居高临下的监牢里去，死在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
