<div class="line_en">The gloomy Hurstwood, sitting in his cheap hotel, where he had taken refuge with seventy dollars -- the price of his furniture -- between him and nothing, saw a hot summer out and a cool fall in, reading. He was not wholly indifferent to the fact that his money was slipping away. As fifty cents after fifty cents were paid out for a day's lodging he became uneasy, and finally took a cheaper room -- thirty-five cents a day -- to make his money last longer. Frequently he saw notices of Carrie. Her picture was in the "World" once or twice, and an old "Herald" he found in a chair informed him that she had recently appeared with some others at a benefit for something or other. He read these things with mingled feelings. Each one seemed to put her farther and farther away into a realm which became more imposing as it receded from him. On the billboards, too, he saw a pretty poster, showing her as the Quaker Maid, demure and dainty. More than once he stopped and looked at these, gazing at the pretty face in a sullen sort of way. His clothes were shabby, and he presented a marked contrast to all that she now seemed to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow, so long as he knew she was at the Casino, though he had never any intention of going near her, there was a subconscious comfort for him -- he was not quite alone. The show seemed such a fixture that, after a month or two, he began to take it for granted that it was still running. In September it went on the road and he did not notice it. When all but twenty dollars of his money was gone, he moved to a fifteen-cent lodging-house in the Bowery, where there was a bare lounging-room filled with tables and benches as well as some chairs. Here his preference was to close his eyes and dream of other days, a habit which grew upon him. It was not sleep at first, but a mental hearkening back to scenes and incidents in his Chicago life. As the present became darker, the past grew brighter, and all that concerned it stood in relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知怎么地，只要他知道她还在卡西诺戏院里演出，虽然他从未有过要走近她的想法，他就下意识地感到有一种安慰——他还不完全是孤单一人。这出戏似乎成了一场雷打不动的固定演出，所以过了一两个月，他开始想当然地以为它还要演下去。9月里，剧团出去巡回演出，他也没有发觉。当他的钱用到只剩下20块的时候，他搬到波威里街一个1毛5分钱一天的寄宿处，那里只有一个四壁空空的休息室，里面放满了桌子、长凳，还有几把椅子。在这里，他喜欢闭上眼睛，回想过去的日子，这个习惯在他身上越来越根深蒂固了。开始时这并不是沉睡，而只是在心里回想起他在芝加哥的生活中的情景和事件。因为眼前的日子越来越黑暗，过去的时光就越发显得光明，而和过去有关的一切都变得分外突出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was unconscious of just how much this habit had hold of him until one day he found his lips repeating an old answer he had made to one of his friends. They were in Fitzgerald and Moy's. It was as if he stood in the door of his elegant little office, comfortably dressed, talking to Sagar Morrison about the value of South Chicago real estate in which the latter was about to invest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还没有意识到这个习惯对他的影响有多大，直到有一天他发现自己嘴里在重复着他曾经回答他的一个朋友的老话。他们正在费莫酒店里。好像他就站在他那个雅致的小办公室门口，衣冠楚楚的，和萨加·莫里森谈论着芝加哥南部某处地产的价值，后者正准备在那里投资。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The movement of his lips aroused him. He wondered whether he had really spoken. The next time he noticed anything of the sort he really did talk.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, looking down the ad. columns of the "Evening World," he saw where a new play was at the Casino. Instantly, he came to a mental halt. Carrie had gone! He remembered seeing a poster of her only yesterday, but no doubt it was one left uncovered by the new signs. Curiously, this fact shook him up. He had almost to admit that somehow he was depending upon her being in the city. Now she was gone. He wondered how this important fact had skipped him. Goodness knows when she would be back now. Impelled by a nervous fear, he rose and went into the dingy hall, where he counted his remaining money, unseen. There were but ten dollars in all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，他在浏览《世界晚报》的广告栏时，看到上面说卡西诺戏院正在上演一出新戏。他心里当即一愣。嘉莉已经走了！他记得就在昨天还看见她的一张海报，但是毫无疑问，那是没有被新海报覆盖而留下的。说来奇怪，这件事震惊了他。他几乎只得承认，不知怎么地，他是靠知道她还在这座城市里才支撑了下来。现在她却走了。他不明白怎么会漏掉这么重要的消息。天知道现在她要到什么时候才能回来。一种精神上的恐惧促使他站起身来，走进阴暗的过道，那里没人看见他。他数了数自己剩下的钱，总共只有10块钱了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not me," he answered, just as he had years before. "I have my hands full now."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a funny English story he was telling to a company of actors. Even as his voice recalled him, he was smiling. A crusty old codger, sitting near by, seemed disturbed; at least, he stared in a most pointed way. Hurstwood straightened up. The humour of the memory fled in an instant and he felt ashamed. For relief, he left his chair and strolled out into the streets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他在向一群演员讲的一个好笑的英国故事。甚至当他被自己的声音弄醒的时候，他还在笑着。坐在旁边的一个顽固的怪老头看上去像是受了打扰，至少，他瞪眼看的样子十分尖刻。赫斯渥挺起身来。记忆中的这段笑话立刻消失了，他感到有些害臊。于是他离开他那把椅子，踱出门外，到街上找消遣去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wondered how all these other lodging-house people around him got along. They didn't seem to do anything. Perhaps they begged -- unquestionably they did. Many was the dime he had given to such as they in his day. He had seen other men asking for money on the streets. Maybe he could get some that way. There was horror in this thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想知道他周围这些住在寄宿处的其他人都是怎么过活的。他们好像什么事都不干。也许他们靠乞讨生活——对，他们肯定是靠乞讨生活。当初他得意的时候，就曾经给过他们这种人无数的小钱。他也曾看到过别人在街上讨钱。或许，他可以同样地讨点钱。这种想法简直令人恐怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sitting in the lodging-house room, he came to his last fifty cents. He had saved and counted until his health was affected. His stoutness had gone. With it, even the semblance of a fit in his clothes. Now he decided he must do something, and, walking about, saw another day go by, bringing him down to his last twenty cents -- not enough to eat for the morrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在寄宿处的房间里，他用得只剩下最后5毛钱了，他省了又省，算了又算，终于影响了健康。他已不再强壮。这样一来，连他的衣服也显得很不合身了。这时他决定必须做些事情，但是，四处走走之后，眼看着一天又过去了，只剩下最后的2毛钱，已不够明天吃饭了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Summoning all his courage, he crossed to Broadway and up to the Broadway Central hotel. Within a block he halted, undecided. A big, heavy-faced porter was standing at one of the side entrances, looking out. Hurstwood purposed to appeal to him. Walking straight up, he was upon him before he could turn away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他鼓足勇气，来到百老汇大街，朝百老汇中央旅馆走去。在离开那里一条横马路的地方，他停住脚，犹豫起来。一个面带愁容的大个子茶房正站在一个侧门口，向外看着。赫斯渥打算去求他帮忙。他一直走上前去，不等对方转身走开，就招呼起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that hour, when Broadway is wont to assume its most interesting aspect, a peculiar individual invariably took his stand at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street and Broadway -- a spot which is also intersected by Fifth Avenue. This was the hour when the theatres were just beginning to receive their patrons. Fire signs announcing the night's amusements blazed on every hand. Cabs and carriages, their lamps gleaming like yellow eyes, pattered by. Couples and parties of three and four freely mingled in the common crowd, which poured by in a thick stream, laughing and jesting. On Fifth Avenue were loungers -- a few wealthy strollers, a gentleman in evening dress with his lady on his arm, some club-men passing from one smoking-room to another. Across the way the great hotels showed a hundred gleaming windows, their cafes and billiard-rooms filled with a comfortable, well-dressed, and pleasure-loving throng. All about was the night, pulsating with the thoughts of pleasure and exhilaration -- the curious enthusiasm of a great city bent upon finding joy in a thousand different ways.</div>

<div class="line_en">This unique individual was no less than an ex-soldier turned religionist, who, having suffered the whips and privations of our peculiar social system, had concluded that his duty to the God which he conceived lay in aiding his fellow-man. The form of aid which he chose to administer was entirely original with himself. It consisted of securing a bed for all such homeless wayfarers as should apply to him at this particular spot, though he had scarcely the wherewithal to provide a comfortable habitation for himself. Taking his place amid this lightsome atmosphere, he would stand, his stocky figure cloaked in a great cape overcoat, his head protected by a broad slouch hat, awaiting the applicants who had in various ways learned the nature of his charity. For a while he would stand alone, gazing like any idler upon an ever- fascinating scene. On the evening in question, a policeman passing saluted him as "captain," in a friendly way. An urchin who had frequently seen him before, stopped to gaze. All others took him for nothing out of the ordinary, save in the matter of dress, and conceived of him as a stranger whistling and idling for his own amusement.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the first half-hour waned, certain characters appeared. Here and there in the passing crowds one might see, now and then, a loiterer edging interestedly near. A slouchy figure crossed the opposite corner and glanced furtively in his direction. Another came down Fifth Avenue to the corner of Twenty-sixth Street, took a general survey, and hobbled off again. Two or three noticeable Bowery types edged along the Fifth Avenue side of Madison Square, but did not venture over. The soldier, in his cape overcoat, walked a short line of ten feet at his corner, to and fro, indifferently whistling.</div>

On every hand curious figures were moving -- watchers and peepers, without an imaginary circle, which they seemed afraid to enter -- a dozen in all. Presently, with the arrival of a keener sense of cold, one figure came forward. It crossed Broadway from out the shadow of Twenty-sixth Street, and, in a halting, circuitous way, arrived close to the waiting figure. There was something shamefaced or diffident about the movement, as if the intention were to conceal any idea of stopping until the very last moment. Then suddenly, close to the soldier, came the halt.</div>

In the glare of the neighbouring electric light he recognised a type of his own kind -- the figures whom he saw about the streets and in the lodging-houses, drifting in mind and body like himself. He wondered what it could be and turned back.</div>

<div class="line_en">Coming down Sixth Avenue this evening, Hurstwood chanced to cross east through Twenty-sixth Street toward Third Avenue. He was wholly disconsolate in spirit, hungry to what he deemed an almost mortal extent, weary, and defeated. How should he get at Carrie now? It would be eleven before the show was over. If she came in a coach, she would go away in one. He would need to interrupt under most trying circumstances. Worst of all, he was hungry and weary, and at best a whole day must intervene, for he had not heart to try again to-night. He had no food and no bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天晚上，赫斯渥沿着第六大道往南走，正巧朝东穿过二十六街，向着第三大道走去。他精神萎靡不振，疲惫不堪，肚子饿得要死。现在他该怎么去找嘉莉呢？散戏要到11点钟。如果她是乘马车来的，一定还会乘马车回去。他只有在令人十分难堪的情况下才能拦住她。最糟糕的是，他现在又饿又累，而且至少还要熬过整整一天，因为今天夜里他已经没有勇气再去尝试了。他既没有东西吃，也没有地方睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back of him, where some of those were whose beds were safe, a relaxed air was apparent. The strain of uncertainty being removed, he heard them talking with moderate freedom and some leaning toward sociability. Politics, religion, the state of the government, some newspaper sensations, and the more notorious facts the world over, found mouthpieces and auditors there. Cracked and husky voices pronounced forcibly upon odd matters. Vague and rambling observations were made in reply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他身后，那些铺位已经有了着落的人站的地方，显然有着一种轻松的气氛。由于不再担心无处过夜，他听到他们的谈话没什么拘束，还带着一些想交朋结友的味道。这里既有谈论的人，也有听众，话题涉及政治、宗教、政府的现状、报上的一些轰动一时的新闻以及世界各地的丑闻。粗哑的声音在使劲地讲述着稀奇古怪的事情。回答的是一些含糊杂乱的意见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was the captain curtly pleading as before. He heard with astonishment and a sense of relief the oft-repeated words: "These men must have a bed." Before him was the line of unfortunates whose beds were yet to be had, and seeing a newcomer quietly edge up and take a position at the end of the line, he decided to do likewise. What use to contend? He was weary to-night. It was a simple way out of one difficulty, at least. To-morrow, maybe, he would do better.</div>

Across Fifth Avenue, through Madison Square by the winding paths, east on Twenty-third Street, and down Third Avenue wound the long, serpentine company. Midnight pedestrians and loiterers stopped and stared as the company passed. Chatting policemen, at various corners, stared indifferently or nodded to the leader, whom they had seen before. On Third Avenue they marched, a seemingly weary way, to Eighth Street, where there was a lodginghouse, closed, apparently, for the night. They were expected, however.</div>
