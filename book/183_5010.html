<div class="line_en">They made harbour in a wide bay about the middle of the afternoon and landed. It was a very different country from any they had yet seen. For when they had crossed the sandy beach they found all silent and empty as if it were an uninhabited land, but before them there were level lawns in which the grass was as smooth and short as it used to be in the grounds of a great English house where ten gardeners were kept. The trees, of which there were many, all stood well apart from one another, and there were no broken branches and no leaves lying on the ground. Pigeons sometimes cooed but there was no other noise.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now the winds which had so long been from the north-west began to blow from the west itself and every morning when the sun rose out of the sea the curved prow of the Dawn Treader stood up right across the middle of the sun. Some thought that the sun looked larger than it looked from Narnia, but others disagreed. And they sailed and sailed before a gentle yet steady breeze and saw neither fish nor gull nor ship nor shore. And stores began to get low again, and it crept into their hearts that perhaps they might have come to a sea which went on for ever. But when the very last day on which they thought they could risk continuing their eastward voyage dawned, it showed, right ahead between them and the sunrise, a low land lying like a cloud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刮了好多天西北风，如今开始转西风了，每天早晨太阳升出海面，黎明踏浪号的雕花船头就恰好对着太阳正中昂然耸立。有人觉得太阳看上去比在纳尼亚看起来要大，可是也有人不同意。他们就这样航行，顺着轻风航行，风虽小，风向倒也不变，既看不见鱼，也看不见海鸥，又看不见船，也看不见海岸。贮藏又开始减少了，大家心里偷偷地想，也许他们开到一个永远到不了头的大海。谁知就在最后一天，他们认为还可以冒险继续东航的那一天，天刚破晓，就看见前面有一片云层似的低地，横亘在船和日出的地方之间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost as soon as they entered this path Lucy noticed that she had a little stone in her shoe. In that unknown place it might have been wiser for her to ask the others to wait while she took it out. But she didn't; she just dropped quietly behind and sat down to take off her shoe. Her lace had got into a knot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎就在他们走上这条小路时，露茜感觉到鞋里有颗小石头。在那种陌生地方，她原该叫别人等着她取出石头才是上策。可是她偏没有，只是悄悄落在后面，坐下来脱鞋。她的鞋带打结了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently they came to a long, straight, sanded path with not a weed growing on it and trees on either hand. Far off at the other end of this avenue they now caught sight of a house -- very long and grey and quiet-looking in the afternoon sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿他们来到一条又长又直的沙子铺的小路，路面上没长一棵野草，两边都栽着树。在这条小路远处的另一头，他们看见一座房子——长长一排，灰色的房子，在午后阳光下显得一派宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What she heard was a thumping. It sounded as if dozens of strong workmen were hitting the ground as hard as they could with great wooden mallets. And it was very quickly coming nearer. She was already sitting with her back to a tree, and as the tree was not one she could climb, there was really nothing to do but to sit dead still and press herself against the tree and hope she wouldn't be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她听到的是一阵砰砰声。听上去像是十几个身强力壮的工人抡着大木槌拼命在捶打地面。很快就越来越近。这时她已经背靠一棵树坐着，因为爬不上树，她实在没办法，只能一动不动坐着，身子紧紧贴着树，但愿人家看不见她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before she had undone the knot the others were a fair distance ahead. By the time she had got the stone out and was putting the shoe on again she could no longer hear them. But almost at once she heard something else. It was not coming from the direction of the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还没解开鞋带，别人己走到前面老远了。等她掏出石头，重新穿上鞋，她已经听不见他们的动静。不过她几乎立刻就听到了别的动静。这声音不是从房子那边传来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thump, thump, thump… and whatever it was must be very close now for she could feel the ground shaking. But she could see nothing. She thought the thing -- or things must be just behind her. But then there came a thump on the path right in front of her. She knew it was on the path not only by the sound but because she saw the sand scatter as if it had been struck a heavy blow. But she could see nothing that had struck it. Then all the thumping noises drew together about twenty feet away from her and suddenly ceased. Then came the Voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="砰，砰，砰……不管这是什么声音，反正这会儿很近了，她都感觉得到地面在震动了。可是她什么也看不见。她以为那东西——或那些东西——一定就在她身后。不料就在她面前的小路上传来砰的一声。她不仅听到那一下响声，而且还看见路面沙土飞扬，仿佛受到一下猛击似的，就知道那东西在小路上了。可是她看不见是什么东西猛击地面。接着所有的砰砰声都凑在一起，大约离她二十英尺远，突然一下子都停了。于是传来说话声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was really very dreadful because she could still see nobody at all. The whole of that park-like country still looked as quiet and empty as it had looked when they first landed. Nevertheless, only a few feet away from her, a voice spoke. And what it said was:</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy knew there was no time to sit puzzling as to what these invisible creatures might be. As soon as the thumping noise had died away she got up and ran along the path after the others as quickly as her legs would carry her. They must at all costs be warned.</div>

It was a low building -- only two stories high made of a beautiful mellow stone, many-windowed, and partially covered with ivy. Everything was so still that Eustace said, "I think it's empty," but Caspian silently pointed to the column of smoke which rose from one chimney.</div>

<div class="line_en">They found a wide gateway open and passed through it into a paved courtyard. And it was here that they had their first indication that there was something odd about this island. In the middle of the courtyard stood a pump, and beneath the pump a bucket. There was nothing odd about that. But the pump handle was moving up and down, though there seemed to be no one moving it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们看到大门洞开，就穿过大门，走进一个铺着石板地面的院子。院子当中有个水泵，水泵下有个水桶。那倒也没什么希奇。希奇的是看上去没人在摇动水泵把手，把手竟在上下摇动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," said the Chief Voice. "It's like this. This island has been the property of a great magician time out of mind. And we all are -- or perhaps in a manner of speaking, I might say, we were -- his servants. Well, to cut a long story short, this magician that I was speaking about, he told us to do something we didn't like. And why not? Because we didn't want to. Well, then, this same magician he fell into a great rage; for I ought to tell you he owned the island and he wasn't used to being crossed. He was terribly downright, you know. But let me see, where am I? Oh yes, this magician then, he goes upstairs (for you must know he kept all his magic things up there and we all lived down below), I say he goes upstairs and puts a spell on us. An uglifying spell. If you saw us now, which in my opinion you may thank your stars you can't, you wouldn't believe what we looked like before we were uglified. You wouldn't really. So there we all were so ugly we couldn't bear to look at one another. So then what did we do? Well, I'll tell you what we did. We waited till we thought this same magician would be asleep in the afternoon and we creep upstairs and go to his magic book, as bold as brass, to see if we can do anything about this uglification. But we were all of a sweat and a tremble, so I won't deceive you. But, believe me or believe me not, I do assure you that we couldn't find any thing in the way of a spell for taking off the ugliness. And what with time getting on and being afraid that the old gentleman might wake up any minute -- I was all of a muck sweat, so I won't deceive you -- well, to cut a long story short, whether we did right or whether we did wrong, in the end we see a spell for making people invisible. And we thought we'd rather be invisible than go on being as ugly as all that. And why? Because we'd like it better. So my little girl, who's just about your little girl's age, and a sweet child she was before she was uglified, though now -- but least said soonest mended -- I say, my little girl she says the spell, for it's got to be a little girl or else the magician himself, if you see my meaning, for otherwise it won't work. And why not? Because nothing happens. So my Clipsie says the spell, for I ought to have told you she reads beautifully, and there we all were as invisible as you could wish to see. And I do assure you it was a relief not to see one another's faces. At first, anyway. But the long and the short of it is we're mortal tired of being invisible. And there's another thing. We never reckoned on this magician (the one I was telling you about before) going invisible too. But we haven't ever seen him since. So we don't know if he's dead, or gone. away, or whether he's just sitting upstairs being invisible, and perhaps coming down and being invisible there. And, believe me, it's no manner of use listening because he always did go about with his bare feet on, making no more noise than a great big cat. And I'll tell all you gentlemen straight, it's getting more than what our nerves can stand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说起来，”头儿声音说，“事情是这样的。不知多少年以前，这个岛原是一个魔法大师的地产。我们全是——或许不妨说，我们全是——他的奴仆。好吧，长话短说，我说起的这个魔法师，他叫我们干我们不喜欢的事。为什么不喜欢？因为我们不愿干。唉，这一来，这个魔法师就大发雷霆。因为我应当告诉你们，他是这个岛的主子，他不习惯人家跟他抬杠。你们要知道，他这人真直爽得不得了。可是让我看看，我说到哪儿了？啊，对了，说到这个魔法师，他上了楼，因为你们必须知道他把所有的魔法玩意儿全放在楼上，我们都住在楼下。我说，他上了楼，对我们施了魔法。一种丑化的魔法。依我看，你们看不见我们还真该谢天谢地，如果你们现在看见我们这模样，才不会相信我们变丑以前长得什么模样呢。你们真不会相信。我们竟丑得大家彼此见了都受不了。那我们怎么办呢？好吧，我告诉你，我们怎么办。我们等到这个魔法师大概睡午觉了，就厚着脸皮偷偷上楼去找他的魔法书，看看有什么办法破这个丑化的魔法。可是我们全都浑身大汗，直打哆嗦，我决不骗你。不过，信不信由你，我们的的确确找不到什么去除丑相的魔法。时间过得很快，生怕这位老先生随时都会醒来——我浑身臭汗，决不骗你——好吧，长话短说，不管我们做得对也好，做得错也好！临了我们看到一种隐身魔法。我们心想，与其这么一副丑相，不如隐身为妙。为什么呢？因为我们情愿这样。于是我的小姑娘，她跟你们的小姑娘年龄差不多，她没变丑以前是个可爱的孩子，虽然如今——啊，还是少说为妙——啊呀，我的小姑娘念了咒语，因为一定得由个小姑娘来念，或者魔法师本人，你们明白我意思吧，否则的话就不灵验。为什么不灵验呢？因为什么都变不了。于是我的小姑娘克莉普西念了咒语，我应当告诉你们，她念得真棒，咒语念好，我们就都遂了心愿，变成隐身人了。不骗你，大家彼此看不见脸倒真轻松了。不管怎样，开头是很轻松的。可是后来我们对隐身却大大厌烦了。不过，还有一件事。我们决没料到这个魔法师，就是我先前跟你们说起的那个人，居然也成了隐身人。我们从此就没看见过他。所以我们不知他是死了呢，还是走掉了。或者是否就坐在楼上却看不见他，也许下楼来了，只是楼下看不见他。真的，听动静根本一点也听不出来，因为他老是光着脚走来走去，像只大猫一般无声无息。我对诸位直说了吧，这使我们的神经更受不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

When it was over there was a very long silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, then, to put it in a nutshell," said the Chief Voice, "we've been waiting for ever so long for a nice little girl from foreign parts, like it might be you, Missie -- that would go upstairs and go to the magic book and find the spell that takes off the invisibleness, and say it. And we all swore that the first strangers as landed on this island (having a nice little girl with them, I mean, for if they hadn't it'd be another matter) we wouldn't let them go away alive unless they'd done the needful for us. And that's why, gentlemen, if your little girl doesn't come up to scratch, it will be our painful duty to cut all your throats. Merely in the way of business, as you might say, and no offence, I hope."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，那就干脆千句并一句，”头儿声音说，“我们一直在等外边来个漂亮的小姑娘，等了好久好久，小姐，就像你这样的姑娘——愿意上楼去找那本魔法书，找到破除隐身法的咒语，念一遍。我们都发过誓，碰到踏上本岛的第一批生人，决不放他们生还，除非他们替我们办到这件该办的大事。我意思是说，如果他们有漂亮的小姑娘的话，如果没有，那就是另一码事了。诸位，正因为如此，所以如果你们的小姑娘干不成，我们就要忍痛把你们宰了。不妨说，仅仅是作为交易而已，希望别见怪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As no one had ever known Reepicheep to be afraid of anything, he could say this without feeling at all awkward. But the boys, who had all been afraid quite often, grew very red. None the less, it was such obvious sense that they had to give in. Loud cheers broke from the invisible people when their decision was announced, and the Chief Voice (warmly supported by all the others) invited the Narnians to come to supper and spend the night. Eustace didn't want to accept, but Lucy said, "I'm sure they're not treacherous. They're not like that at all," and the others agreed.
