<div class="line_en">"Indeed, Monsieur. However, the smallest detail has remained in my memory as clearly as if it happened yesterday. I had a brother, an elder brother, who served the emperor. He had risen to the rank of lieutenant in a regiment entirely composed of Corsicans. My brother was my only friend; we had been left orphans when I was five and he was eighteen, and he brought me up as though I were his son. In 1814, under the Bourbons, he got married. Then the emperor came back from Elba, my brother immediately returned to the army and, after sustaining a slight wound at Waterloo, he retreated with the army beyond the Loire."</div>

The letter was from my brother and informed us that the army had been disbanded and he was returning home, via Châteauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy and Nîmes.

I had a thousand francs, so I left five hundred for Assunta -- that is, my sister-in-law -- and, with the other five hundred, I set off for Nîmes. It was easy. I had a boat and a cargo to pick up on the way, so everything favoured my design. But once I had taken on the cargo, the wind changed and we had to wait for four or five days before we could pass the mouth of the Rhône. Finally, we succeeded in entering the river, and sailed up as far as Arles. I left the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and set off on the road for Nîmes."</div>

I went over to him, and said under my breath: 'Well, then, since you know Corsicans, you must know that they keep their word. Because you are a Royalist, you think that it was a good thing to kill my brother, a Bonapartist. Well, I too am a Bonapartist, and let me tell you something: I shall kill you. From this moment on, I declare a vendetta against you, so look after and protect yourself as best you may, because the next time we are face to face, your last hour will have come.'

From then on I was no longer my own man: I had to protect and support my sister-in-law. I stalked Monsieur de Villefort for three months, and for three months he did not take a step, go for a walk or take a stroll without my watching where he went. Finally I discovered that he was paying mysterious visits to Auteuil. I followed him and saw him enter the house where we are now; but instead of going in like everyone else through the main door on the street, he arrived, either on horseback or by carriage, left his horse or his carriage at the inn and entered the house by the little door that you see there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最要紧的事情是不但要杀死他——因为这种机会我有过一百次了——并且要杀死他而不被人发觉，至少，不被人捉住。我已不再是属于我自己了，因为我得保护和供养我的嫂嫂。接连三个月，我钉住了维尔福先生，那三个月里面，只要他一出门，我就跟着他。终于，我发觉他偷偷摸摸地到阿都尔去了。我跟他到那儿，我看他走进我们现在的这所房子，只是，他并不从向街的大门进来，他原是骑马或是乘车来的，但他却把车子或马留在小客栈里，从那扇门进来，您看，就是那儿的那扇门！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He understood it well enough to avoid going out alone from that time onwards, and to hole up in his house, while getting his people to look everywhere for me. Luckily I was too well hidden for them to find me. So then he took fright. He was afraid to stay any longer in Nîmes and asked to be moved. Since he was a person with influence, he was appointed to Versailles. However, as you know, no distance is too great for a Corsican when he has sworn revenge on his enemy, and his carriage, swift as it was, could never keep more than half a day's journey ahead of me, even though I was following on foot.</div>

No one protested. I was shown the way to the orphanage, which was at the far end of the Rue d'Enfer and, after taking the precaution of cutting the sheet in half, so that a piece with one of the two letters embroidered on it was still wrapped around the child, I put my bundle down at the gatehouse, rang the bell and fled as fast as I could.

<div class="line_en">"Partly to drive away the memories that plagued me and partly to provide for the poor widow, I returned eagerly to the profession of smuggling which had been made easier by the relaxation of laws that always follows a revolution. The southern coasts of France, in particular, were badly guarded because of the unending riots that took place, sometimes in Avignon, sometimes in Nîmes, sometimes in Uzès. We took advantage of the sort of truce accorded us by the government to establish relations on all parts of the coastline. Since my brother's murder in the streets of Nîmes, I had been loath to return there; the outcome was that the innkeeper with whom we used to deal, seeing that we no longer came to him, had decided to come to us and set up a companion to his inn on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. Near Aigues-Mortes, in Martigues or in Bouc we also had a dozen warehouses where we could deposit our goods and where, if the need arose, we could hide out from the Customs and the gendarmes. Smuggling is a trade that pays well when carried on with a measure of intelligence and some zeal. As for myself, I lived in the mountains, because I now had a double reason to fear the gendarmes and the Customs men, in view of the fact that my arraignment in front of a judge could lead to an enquiry, and every enquiry is an excursion into the past: in my past, now, they might come across something more serious than smuggled cigars or a few barrels of brandy being dispatched without the proper papers. So, preferring death a thousand times to arrest, I accomplished astonishing feats which, more than once, proved to me that our excessive concern with the welfare of our bodies is almost the only obstacle to the success of any of our plans, when these demand rapid decisions and vigorous and determined execution. In reality, once you have made the sacrifice of your life, you are no longer the equal of other men; or, rather, they are no longer your equal, because whoever has taken such a resolution instantly feels his strength increase ten times and his outlook vastly extended."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Poor Assunta had guessed everything. She had taken advantage of my absence and, taking the half of the sheet with her, had written down the exact day and time when the child was left in the orphanage, so that she would not forget them. Then she set off for Paris and went herself to reclaim him. No obstacle was put in her way, and the child was entrusted to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Alas! Excellency, how right you are!" Bertuccio continued. "It was the child himself that God appointed to punish me. Never did a more perverse character become evident earlier in life, yet no one can say that he was badly brought up, because my sister-in-law treated him like the son of a prince. He was a handsome boy, with light-blue eyes, like the colour in Chinese porcelain that harmonizes so well with the milky whiteness of the background; but his strawberry-blond hair, which was excessively bright, gave a strange appearance to his face, heightening his vivacious look and roguish smile. Unfortunately a proverb says that redheads are either all good or all bad; it was right in Benedetto's case: he was all bad from childhood on. Admittedly, his mother's sweet nature also encouraged his natural bent. My poor sister-in-law would travel four or five leagues to the town market to buy the earliest fruit and the finest sweetmeats, while the child disdained Palma oranges or Genoese preserves, preferring the chestnuts that he could steal from the neighbours by climbing over the hedge or the apples that were drying out in their loft -- when he had all the chestnuts and apples he wanted in our own orchard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉！大人说对啦，”伯都西奥答道，“上帝把这个婴儿作为惩罚我们的工具。从来没有哪一个人的邪恶的天性这样早就表露出来的，可是这决不是由于教养方面有什么过错。他是一个最可爱的孩子，有一对深蓝色的大眼睛，和他洁白的肤色非常相称，只是他的头发太淡了一点，使他的面貌看来有点古怪，但那却使他的眼光加倍灵活，使他的微笑加倍刻毒。不幸，在我们那儿有一句谚语，叫做‘脸蛋儿长得俊，不是好到极点，便是坏到透顶。’这句谚语用在贝尼台多身上实在太正确啦，甚至在幼年时代，他已显露出最恶劣的气质。不错，他母亲的溺爱也鼓励了他。这个孩子，我那可怜的嫂嫂肯为他跑一、二十哩路到镇上去买最新鲜的果子和最好吃的糖果，但他不爱帕尔马的橘子或热那亚的蜜饯，却偏爱到一家邻居的果园里去偷栗子或在搁楼上偷吃苹果干，虽然我的花园里长的胡桃和苹果可以随他吃个够。">查看中文翻译</div>

We thought he had miscalculated, but he insisted that he was sure of what he said.

<div class="line_en">"I was terrified. Any further unfavourable report might have serious consequences: I had shortly to go away from Corsica on an important expedition. I thought carefully and, hoping to ward off disaster, I decided to take Benedetto with me. I hoped that the rough and active life of a smuggler, and the harsh discipline on board ship, would rescue a character on the point of being corrupted, provided it had not already gone too far. So I took Benedetto aside and suggested that he accompany me, dressing the proposal up with every sort of promise that might attract a twelve-year-old boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我慌了，因为一经控告，就可能发生严重的后果。这个时期我不得不离开科西嘉去作一次重要的远征，我考虑了很多时候，决定要贝尼台多陪我去，希望借此来避免一场临近的祸事。走私贩子的生活是活跃而辛苦的，我希望那种生活，再加船上严格的纪律，可以使他那种已差不多堕落的性格来一个有益的转变。我和贝尼台多单独谈话，叫他陪我去，努力用种种最能打动一个十二岁的孩子的幻想的许诺去引诱他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We had no idea who had revealed the secret to him, despite our efforts to conceal it. However it may be, this reply, which was entirely characteristic of the child, filled me with something close to fear, and my raised hand fell without touching the guilty boy. He had triumphed and the victory made him so bold that, from then on, Assunta, whose love for him seemed to increase in proportion to his unworthiness, spent all her money on whims that she was unable to combat and follies that she did not have the strength to prevent. When I was in Rogliano, then the situation was still more or less bearable. But as soon as I left, Benedetto became master of the house and everything went wrong. When he had barely reached the age of eleven, all his friends were young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst young hooligans of Bastia and Corte; and already, because of some tricks (which deserved a worse name), the law had warned us about him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们始终不知道这个要命的秘密是谁泄露出来的，我们一向小心地瞒着他，总之，在这一句回答里，那孩子的全部性格都暴露出来了，我几乎被他吓倒，我的手垂了下来，连碰都没有碰到他。那孩子得胜了，而这次胜利使他变成这样肆无忌惮，以致把爱苏泰所有的钱都任意用掉。他愈不成器，爱苏泰似乎愈爱他，她不知道该如何抑制他的任性，也没有勇气阻止他的放荡行为。当我在洛格里亚诺的时候，一切还好，但只要我一转身，贝尼台多就成了一家之主，而一切就都糟了。当他才十一岁的时候，他就已在十八九岁的年轻小伙子里挑选他的伙伴，而且选中的都是巴斯蒂亚甚至科西嘉最坏的家伙，他们已经闹过不少恶作剧，好几次有人恐吓要控告他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

But the idea that I would beat a child whose father I had killed made it impossible for me to punish him. I gave good advice to my sister, who always took the miserable child's side whenever we talked about him and, since she confessed to me that she had several times lost quite large sums of money, I showed her a place where she could hide our little fortune. For my part, I had made up my mind what to do. Benedetto knew very well how to read, write and do sums, because when he happened to want to work he could learn in one day what took another child a week. As I said, my mind was made up. I would sign him on as secretary on some ocean-going ship and, without giving him any advance warning, have him picked up one fine morning and carried on board. In this way, if I recommended him to the captain, he would be entirely responsible for his own future. Having taken this decision, I set off for France.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The start of our expedition went off without a hitch. Our boat had a concealed hold to hide our contraband; we tied up alongside a large number of other boats lining both banks of the Rhône from Beaucaire to Arles. When we arrived there, we began to unload the forbidden goods at night and had them carried into town by associates of ours, or by the innkeepers whom we used to supply. It may be that success had made us careless, or else we had been betrayed, because one evening, around five o'clock, just as we were about to sit down to a light meal, our boy ran up in a state of great excitement to tell us that he had seen a squad of revenue men approaching. What worried us was not the patrol itself -- because whole companies of Customs officials would scour the banks of the Rhône, and especially at that time -- but the precautions that the boy told us they were taking not to be seen. We instantly leapt up, but it was already too late: our boat, which had clearly been the object of their investigation, was surrounded. Among the Customs men I noticed some gendarmes. Now the sight of these frightened me as much as that of any other militiamen would make me bold, so I went down into the hold and, slipping out through one of the hatches, I let myself slide into the river, then swam underwater, holding my breath for long periods, and escaped detection until I reached a small ditch that had just been dug, joining the Rhône to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. Once there, I was safe, because I could go down the ditch without being seen. In this way, I reached the canal without incident. I had chosen this route of escape deliberately: I think I told Your Excellency about an innkeeper in Nîmes who had set up a little hostelry on the Beaucaire to Bellgarde road."</div>

Usually, even in normal circumstances, we did not enter his house by the front door and I decided to follow our established procedure, so I climbed over the garden hedge, crawled past the stunted olive-trees and wild figs and, fearing that Caderousse had some traveller in his inn, I made my way to a kind of hutch in which I had more than once spent the night as comfortably as in the best bed. This hutch or cupboard was only separated from the main parlour on the ground floor of the inn by a wooden wall, in which holes had been drilled for us, so that we could wait there until the time was ripe for us to reveal our presence. If Caderousse was alone, I intended to announce my arrival to him, finish at this table the meal that had been interrupted by the arrival of the Customs men and take advantage of the coming storm to return to the banks of the Rhône and find out what had become of the ship and those on board.
