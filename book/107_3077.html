<div class="line_en">It was known that Dr Proudie would have to appoint a warden for Hiram's Hospital, as the new law stated. No one imagined that he had any choice -- no one thought for a moment that he could appoint any other man than Mr Harding. Mr Harding himself, without giving the matter much thought, considered it certain that he would return to the warden's pleasant house and garden.</div>

<div class="line_en">There she was, however, and they could only make the best of it. They greeted his lordship, who introduced them to his lady wife. Then Mr Slope presented himself, offering a damp hand to his new enemy, Dr Grantly, who bowed, looked stiff, and wiped his hand with a pocket handkerchief. Mr Slope then descended to the level of the lower clergy, by speaking a few words to Mr Harding, before rejoining the conversation among the higher powers. There were four people in this group, each of whom considered himself or herself the most important person in Barchester; with such a difference of opinion they were not likely to get on pleasantly together.</div>

I do hope the distance is not too great for country visiting. I shall be glad to call on Mrs Grantly, as soon as our horses arrive here. At present they are in London, as the bishop still has meetings to attend there -- I fear the government cannot do without him!

Dr Proudie himself seemed to have nothing to complain of, but Mr Slope gave a long list of repairs that needed to be done, and Mrs Proudie was not slow to add her voice to his. Finally and with great relief Dr Grantly and Mr Harding were able to bring their visit to an end.</div>

<div class="line_en">The service was very well performed.

He was listened to with breathless attention and considerable surprise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Slope, however, was better prepared for the attack than the archdeacon. Dr Proudie had told the Barchester clergy that Mr Slope would give the sermon at the cathedral service the next Sunday. On this occasion the bishop took his seat in the cathedral for the first time, and the good people of Barchester crowded into the great building, eager to see their new bishop and hear his chaplain's words of spiritual guidance. All the clergy attended the service too, even the archdeacon.</div>

<div class="line_en">The archdeacon and the rest of the clergy could not believe their ears. All their lives they had conducted services in the way they had considered most excellent, and now this young nobody dared to say they had been wrong! But at last Mr Slope sat down. The bishop, who had been the most surprised of them all, and whose hair almost stood on end with terror, gave the final blessing in a shaking voice, and the service was at an end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="执事长和其他神职人员简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。他们这一辈子都在以自认为最合乎理想的方式做礼拜，眼前这个无名毛头小子真是大胆，居然敢说他们一直以来的做法是错的！不过，斯洛普先生最终还是坐了下来。所有人之中，主教最为惊恐，几乎是毛发直立。他声音颤抖着念完最后一段祝祷，礼拜仪式就此结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cleverly giving the impression that he was speaking on behalf of the bishop, Mr Slope made it very clear what would be expected from the Barchester clergy from now on. All the habits and customs which were dear to their hearts were held up to scorn. In particular, he explained how unnecessary church music was, and how much more meaningful the words of the church service were, if spoken rather than sung!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯洛普先生通过巧妙的方式让教众觉得，他是在代表主教发言，还明确指出，巴彻斯特的神职人员今后该如何如何。他们原本珍视的种种习俗，全部都遭到了嘲笑。他还特地说明，教堂音乐是如何没有必要，教堂礼拜的语言又是多么富含深意，只要这样的语言是用来布道而不是歌唱！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the next few days there was heated discussion of Mr Slope and his sermon. Against him were the archdeacon and almost all the clergy, who were so furious they decided he should never be allowed to give a sermon in the cathedral again. Poor Mr Harding began to have doubts about the value of church music; he had always been so proud of the singing in the cathedral, but he wondered if that was another thing he would have to give up, like the wardenship of Hiram's Hospital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来几天，人们就斯洛普先生和他的布道展开了激烈的争论。反方包括执事长和几乎所有神职人员，他们怒火冲天，决定再也不允许他在大教堂里布道。可怜的哈丁先生则开始质疑教堂音乐的价值。一直以来，大教堂里的歌声都让他引以为豪，如今他却觉得，这又是他不得不放弃的，就像当初放弃海勒姆养老院院长职位一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, Eleanor Bold and her sister-in-law Mary Bold were not to be counted among these ladies. It was natural for Mr Harding's daughter to be proud of the cathedral's musical tradition, and angry with Mr Slope for criticizing it. And in such matters the widow Bold and her sister-in-law were in perfect agreement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，埃莉诺·博尔德和她的大姑子玛丽·博尔德并不那么认为。身为哈丁先生的女儿，埃莉诺自然会以教堂的音乐传统为荣，为斯洛普先生的抨击感到愤怒。而在这样的事情上，寡妇博尔德和她的大姑子意见绝对一致。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Mr Slope's side, however, were one or two clergymen who thought it sensible to congratulate the chaplain on his sermon. They included Mr Quiverful, the vicar of Puddingdale, whose wife presented him every year with a fresh proof of her love, increasing his cares and, it is to be hoped, his happiness equally. Who can wonder that a vicar with fourteen living children and only ￡400 a year should wish to be polite to a Mr Slope? There were also a number of Barchester citizens who thought Mr Slope might be right. For too long the clergy had gone on in their old-fashioned ways; perhaps it was time to introduce some of the religious changes which were shaking up the outside world. This group consisted mostly of ladies; no gentleman could possibly be attracted by Mr Slope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，也有那么一两名神职人员站在了斯洛普先生那边，他们认为明智的做法是祝贺特遣牧师很好地完成了布道，这当中包括帕丁戴尔的代牧奎沃夫先生。他的妻子每年都向他呈献一个爱的结晶，增添了他的烦恼，但愿也能让他更快乐。这位代牧要抚养十四名子女，年薪却只有区区四百英镑，他想向斯洛普先生这样的人示好，又有谁会觉得奇怪呢？此外，有一些巴彻斯特的居民也觉得，斯洛普先生也许说得对。长久以来，这里的神职人员因循守旧，而宗教改革正在颠覆外面的世界，说不定，引入此类变革的时候已经到了。有这样想法的居民大多是女士，绅士是不可能对斯洛普先生感兴趣的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这就是斯洛普先生上门时受到的礼遇。然而，等到出门的时候，他竟然获准为婴儿祈福，还握了握两位女士的手，告别时宛如一位值得信任的朋友。这么短的时间，他是如何化干戈为玉帛，跟两位女士言归于好的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day after this visit Eleanor told her father of it, and expressed an opinion that Mr Slope was not quite as black as he had been painted. Mr Harding said little; he did not approve of the visit, but it was not his custom to speak evil of anyone. Instead he turned the conversation to the wardenship of Hiram's Hospital; he told Eleanor he expected the bishop to offer it to him, although at a reduced salary. It was annoying to have to accept the post as a gift from the bishop, especially if it came from the hands of the hated Slope, but he would certainly accept it. Eleanor was delighted at the thought of seeing her dear father happy in his old place at Hiram's Hospital again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他来访后的第二天，埃莉诺就把这件事告诉了父亲，并且表示，自己并不觉得斯洛普先生像大家说的那么不堪。哈丁先生没说什么。他不满斯洛普先生踏入他家，但也不习惯说人长短。于是，他岔开话题，说起了海勒姆养老院院长一职。他对埃莉诺说，希望主教能让他担任这个职务，工资比以前少也无所谓。像接受馈赠一样从主教手里得到这个职位的确叫人生气，更何况，可能会由可恶的斯洛普授予他这一职位。但他肯定还是会接受。想到自己可以看到亲爱的父亲重返海勒姆养老院，在老地方开开心心地生活，埃莉诺很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Mr Slope himself persuaded them to think better of him. To their great surprise and no little fear, he came to call on them two weeks after his sermon. The great enemy of all that was good in Barchester entered their own sitting room, and they had no strong arm at hand for their protection. The widow held her baby tightly in her arms, and Mary Bold stood up ready to die in that baby's defence, if such a sacrifice might become necessary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，斯洛普先生说服她们改善了对自己的印象。那次布道的两个星期之后，他来拜访她们，让她们大为惊恐。巴彻斯特一切美好事物的死敌走进了她们的会客厅，她们身边却没有保护她们的强壮臂膀。寡妇把她的婴儿紧紧抱在怀里，玛丽·博尔德则站起身来，准备在必要时牺牲自己拼死保护孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three months passed, and several changes were made in Barchester. Among other things, absentee clergymen had been recalled to their duties. One of these was Dr Vesey Stanhope, who was quite a stranger in the city. Twelve years ago he had gone to Italy to cure a sore throat, and that sore throat, although it never developed into anything serious, had enabled him to live there in comfortable idleness, while he paid junior clergymen to do his work at home. But when he received an almost threatening letter from Mr Slope, Dr Stanhope realized he would have to spend the summer months, at least, in his house in Barchester, otherwise his income from the Church might be discontinued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个月过去了，巴彻斯特发生了一些变化。其中一个变化就是，那些在外的神职人员被重新召回了岗位。维西·斯坦诺普博士就在此列，城中认识他的人寥寥无几。十二年前，他前往意大利治疗喉咙痛的毛病，尽管这个毛病并没有恶化，他却借此在那里过上了悠闲自在的日子，自己在家乡的工作则是花钱雇了一些年轻的神职人员替他做。但当斯坦诺普博士收到一封来自斯洛普先生的信，几乎是威胁他回去时，他意识到自己不得不回巴彻斯特的老家，至少要在那里过完夏天这几个月，否则教堂支付的薪水有可能就此中断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he and his charming but heartless family took up residence again in Barchester. His wife was still a handsome woman, even at fifty-five. She never appeared until between three and four in the afternoon, but when she did appear, she appeared at her best. Her dress was always perfect, but she had no other purpose in life than to dress well. Her elder daughter Charlotte, at thirty-five, was a fine young woman, who had taken all the cares of running the house off her mother's shoulders. She and she alone could persuade her father to consider worldly matters. She and she alone could control the foolishness of her brother and sister. She and she alone prevented the whole family from losing their good name and falling into beggary.</div>

Why she had decided to marry Paulo Neroni, a man of no birth and no fortune, a man of evil temper and oily manners, was a mystery, but perhaps when the moment came, she had no choice. Six months after her marriage, however, she arrived at her father's house in Milan, a cripple and a mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦诺普博士的次女马德琳是个大美人。她年轻时在意大利生活，让很多小伙子肝肠寸断，自己却不曾伤过心，尽管这些经历最终让她的名声多少有些受损。马德琳当初嫁的是保罗·内罗尼，这个人出身卑微，不名一文，脾气暴躁，油头滑脑。马德琳为什么嫁给他真让人猜不透。不过，这很有可能是因为当时她别无选择。然而，结婚不过六个月，她就回到了父亲在米兰的家，成了个跛子，还做了母亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although forced to give up all movement in the world, Signora Neroni had no intention of giving up the world itself. She made arrangements to be carried to the theatres and parties she wished to attend. There, lying on a sofa, she would soon draw every interesting young man to her side by the power of her beauty. Her admirers were too blindly in love to see the cruelty, sharp intelligence and desire for power in her lovely eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管被迫全盘放弃在世间走动，内罗尼太太却无意与世隔绝。但凡想去的剧院和晚会，她都会安排人带她去。到了那些地方，她躺在沙发上，很快就能靠美貌把自己感兴趣的年轻小伙全都吸引到身边来。倾慕她的人都被爱情蒙蔽了眼睛，看不到那双动人的眼睛里隐藏着的残忍和精明，还有对权力的渴求。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had fallen, she said, and injured her knee, so that she was unable to walk normally. She had therefore made up her mind, once and for ever, that she would never attempt to move herself again. Soon people were saying that she owed her accident to her husband's violence, but she spoke little of Paulo Neroni, except to make it clear he was to be seen and heard of no more. The Stanhopes welcomed the unfortunate beauty and her small daughter into the family home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说自己摔了一跤，伤了膝盖，所以没法正常走路。因此她下定了决心，从此再也不下地走动。很快，人们就风传她这次意外是丈夫施暴所致，但她绝口不提保罗·内罗尼，除了向人表明，自己再也不想看见他，再也不想听到他的消息。斯坦诺普一家把这位不幸的美人和她年幼的女儿迎进了家门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the evening in question, Mrs Proudie welcomed her guests to the palace's fine rooms, and Mr Slope rushed here and there, giving orders to the servants. The bishop kept tripping over a sofa that had been placed near the top of the stairs. One of his daughters told him it was for a lady with no legs, and he was dying of curiosity to see this strange lady.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bertie Stanhope, who was talking to the bishop, had the idea of moving Madeline's sofa slightly, to give everyone a little more room -- he gave it a push and it rushed halfway across the room. Mrs Proudie was standing with Mr Slope in front of Madeline, trying to be sociable, but she was not in the best of tempers; she found that whenever she spoke to the signora, that lady replied by speaking to Mr Slope. Mrs Proudie was just beginning to feel offended, when one of the sofa legs caught itself in her dress and carried part of the skirt away with an unpleasant tearing sound.</div>
