<div class="line_en">The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry's scar burned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around him and there was triumph in his heart -- They have the boy.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="砰的一声巨响，哈利又回到他置身的地方，他茫然地举起魔杖，可是面前的女巫已经向前扑倒。她重重地摔倒在地，震得书柜的玻璃丁当作响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Luna's feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. There were gasps and CRIes of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢娜的脚突然出现了，哈利赶紧跑到她身边。她刚把隐形衣披到两人身上，门就开了，一群穿着睡衣的拉文克劳学生拥进了公共休息室。他们看见阿莱克托不省人事地躺在地上，都倒抽了一口冷气，发出惊讶的尖叫。慢慢地，他们蹭过去围在她身边，看着这个随时都会醒来、向他们发起进攻的猛兽。然后，一个勇敢的一年级新生冲过去用大脚趾顶了顶她的后背。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven't got Potter -- d'you want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!" Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿莱克托！如果他来了，我们却没有抓住波特——你想遭到跟马尔福一家同样的下场吗？快回答我！”阿米库斯大声咆哮着，一边拼命地推搡着门，可是门没有开。拉文克劳的同学们纷纷后退，最害怕的几个开始匆匆跑回楼上的卧室。哈利正在犹豫着是不是应该把门炸开，击昏阿米库斯，不让他再做别的。就在这时，门外又响起一个极为熟悉的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We can push it off on the kids," said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly crafty. "Yeah, that's what we'll do.
