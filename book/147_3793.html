<div class="line_en">From time to time, in spite of himself, they taught him a little German, a language of which he had been quite happily ignorant. The lesson had become for them a daily hunger: they worked it over with mad intensity, speeding and polishing their translation in order to enjoy his bewilderment. Sometimes, deliberately, they salted their pages with glib false readings, sometimes they interpolated passages of wild absurdity, waiting exultantly for his cautious amendment of a word that did not exist.</div>

<div class="line_en">They read sweet gluey little stories, fat German tear-gulps: Immensee, Höher als die Kirche, Der Zerbrochene Krug. Then, Wilhelm Tell. The fine lyrical measure of the opening song, the unearthly siren song to the fisher-boy, haunted them with its faery music. The heavy melodrama of some of the scenes was unhackneyed to them: they bent eagerly to the apple-shooting scene, and the escape by boat. As for the rest, it was, they wearily recognized, Great Literature. Mr. Schiller, they saw, was religiously impressed, like Patrick Henry, George Washington, and Paul Revere, with the beauties of Liberty. His embattled Swiss bounded ponderously from crag to crag, invoking it in windy speeches.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guy Doak had a trim cocky figure of medium height, black hair, bright dark eyes, a pale, very smooth oval face, somehow suggestive, Eugene thought, of a fish's belly, with somewhat unhappily full jaws which made his lower features seem larger than his upper. He was foppishly neat in his dress. People called him a good-looking boy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside of this, Guy Doak was a very nice fellow -- sharp, obstinate, unsubtle, and pleased with his wit. They lived on the first floor at Leonard's: at night, by a roaring wood fire, they listened carefully to the great thunder of the trees, and to the stealthy creaking foot-steps of the master as he came softly down the stairs, and paused by their door. They ate at table with Margaret, John Dorsey, Miss Amy, the two children, John Dorsey, junior, nine, and Margaret, five, and two of Leonard's Tennessee nephews -- Tyson Leonard, a ferret-faced boy of eighteen, foulmouthed and sly, and Dirk Barnard, a tall slender boy, seventeen, with a bumpy face, brown merry eyes, and a quick temper. At table they kept up a secret correspondence of innuendo and hidden movement, fleshing a fork in a grunting neighbor as John Dorsey said the blessing, and choking with smothered laughter. At night, they tapped messages on floor and ceiling, crept out for sniggering conventions in the windy dark hall, and fled to their innocent beds as John Dorsey stormed down on them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了这个弱点以外，盖伊·陀克是个非常不错的人——他的反应很机敏，性情倔强，从不口是心非、对自己的机智颇为得意。他们住在伦纳德家的一楼，晚上他们坐在熊熊的炉火前，认真倾听林莽的涛声，倾听老师下楼时地板的响声。老师常常会在门口停留一会儿。他们和玛格丽特、约翰·陶塞、艾米小姐一起用餐，除此之外，一起用餐的还有伦纳德的两个孩子、9岁的小陶塞、5岁的玛格丽特以及伦纳德从田纳西来的两个侄儿——一个叫泰森·伦纳德，18岁，长得尖嘴猴腮、机灵古怪、满口脏话；还有一个叫德克·巴纳德，17岁，瘦高个子，满脸坑坑洼洼，一双棕色的眼睛看起来很欢快，他动不动就发脾气。吃饭前约翰·陶塞会做祷告，在这个间隙他们便会挤眉弄眼，做一些隐藏的小动作，或者拿饭叉捅一捅邻座的人，然后发出嘶哑的、发呛的笑声。晚上，他们往往会敲击地板和天花板，以此来传递信息，要么就溜进黑暗阴冷的走廊，聚在一起窃笑着。等到约翰·陶塞闻声赶来时，他们会撒腿跑回自己可爱的床上，若无其事地睡觉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guy Doak had none of their floridity. He was lacking in their hearty violence. He did not laugh loudly. He had a sharp, bright, shallow mind, inflexibly dogmatic. His companions were bad Southern romantics, he was a false Yankee realist. They arrived, thus, by different means, at a common goal of superstition. Guy Doak had already hardened into the American city-dweller's mould of infantile cynicism. He was occasionally merry with the other boys in the classic manner of the city fellow with the yokels. He was wise. Above all, he was wise. It was safe to assume, he felt, that Truth was always on the scaffold, and Wrong forever on the throne. So far from being depressed by the slaughter of the innocents, the spectacle gave him much bitter amusement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖伊·陀克跟别的孩子不同，没有他们那么喜欢热闹，也不喜欢暴力。他一般不会大声地说笑。他的思想敏锐、积极，不过稍微有些浅薄，有些死板。他结交的都是一些不学无术的南方浪漫分子，他本人也是一个伪善的美国式现实主义者。于是他们殊途同归，具有共同的生活目标。盖伊·陀克已经学会了美国城市居民幼稚的愤世态度。有时候他会拿同班同学取乐，完全就像传统的城里人取笑乡巴佬那样。别的不说，重要的是，他很聪明。他认为真理总会被绞杀，不公正经常会大行其道。因此，他对无辜者被屠杀一点都不会沮丧，相反他会觉得这种情况更有意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leonard was fighting hard to keep his little school alive. He had less than twenty students the first year, and less than thirty the second. From an income of not more than $3,000 he had to pay Miss Amy, who had left a high school position to help him, a small salary. The old house on its fine wooded hill was full of outmoded plumbing and drafty corridors: he had leased it at a small rental. But the rough usage of thirty boys demanded a considerable yearly restoration. The Leonards were fighting very stubbornly and courageously for their existence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伦纳德想通过拼命工作来使自己的学校维持下去。第一年他的学生人数还不到20个人，第二年不足30人，年收入不到3000元，但是他还得给离开中学教职、前来帮忙的艾米小姐支付微薄的工资。这所陈旧的校舍建在松树茂盛的小山上，楼内的管道早已老化，过道里到处都有破洞，四处漏风。他花了不多一点钱租下了这间房子。但是30个孩子的粗野玩闹致使每年的修缮费用也不是个小数目。但是为了生存，伦纳德夫妇二人执着、勇敢地努力抗争着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The food was scant and poor: at breakfast, a dish of blue, watery oatmeal, eggs and toast; at lunch, a thin soup, hot sour cornbread, and a vegetable boiled with a piece of fat pork; at dinner, hot biscuits, a small meat loaf, and creamed or boiled potatoes. No one was permitted coffee or tea, but there was an abundance of fresh creamy milk. John Dorsey always kept and milked his own cow. Occasionally there was a deep, crusted pie, hot, yolky muffins, or spicy gingerbread of Margaret's make. She was a splendid cook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学校里的伙食质次量少：早餐是一盘稀稀的燕麦粥、鸡蛋和烤面包；午餐是清汤、烘热的玉米酸面包、肥猪肉炖菜；晚餐有饼干、一小块面包、奶油土豆或者煮土豆。谁也不允许喝咖啡和茶，但是鲜牛奶可以敞开肚子尽情享用。约翰·陶塞总是自己养牛，自己挤牛奶。他们偶尔会吃到由玛格丽特亲手烤制的酥脆饼、热乎乎的蛋黄松饼，或者香喷喷的姜饼。她是个烹饪高手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Often, at night, Guy Doak slid quietly out through the window on to the side porch, and escaped down the road under the concealing roar of the trees. He would return from town within two hours, crawling in exultantly with a bag full of hot frankfurter sandwiches coated thickly with mustard, chopped onion, and a hot Mexican sauce. With a crafty grin he unfoiled two five-cent cigars, which they smoked magnificently, with a sharp tang of daring, blowing the smoke up the chimney in order to thwart a possible irruption by the master. And Guy brought back, from the wind and the night, the good salt breath of gossip in street and store, news of the town, and the brave swagger of the drugstore gallants.</div>

And from even deeper adyts of his brain there swam up slowly to the shores of his old hunger the great fish whose names he scarcely knew -- whose names, garnered with blind toil from a thousand books, from Augustine, himself a name, to Jeremy Taylor, the English metaphysician, were brief evocations of scalded light, electric, phosphorescent, illuminating by their magic connotations the vast far depths of ritual and religion: They came -- Bartholomew, Hilarius, Chrysostomos, Polycarp, Anthony, Jerome, and the forty martyrs of Cappadocia who walked the waves -- coiled like their own green shadows for a moment, and were gone.</div>

Drink to me only with thine eyes. She rose slowly, looking into the mirror of her open purse. Then, fluescent, her ripe limbs moulded in a dress of silk henna, she writhed carefully among the crowded tables, with a low rich murmur of contrition. Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and low -- an excellent thing in a woman. The high light chatter of the tables dropped as she went by. For God's sake, hold your tongue and let me love! On amber undulant limbs she walked slowly up the aisle past perfume, stationery, rubber goods, and toilet preparations, pausing at the cigar counter to pay her check. Her round, melon-heavy breasts nodded their heads in slow but sprightly dance. A poet could not but be gay, in such a jocund company.</div>
