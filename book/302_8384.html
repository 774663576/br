<div class="line_en">Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him creditfor being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as hewished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured byfinding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountablebias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very sillywoman, -- but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for anysensible man to be lastingly hurt by it. -- It was rather a wish ofdistinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment ofevery body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It wasthe desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was toocommon to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed byestablishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attachany one to him except his wife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺经过一段短暂的观察，并不相信帕尔默先生真像他想表露的那样脾气不好，缺乏教养。也许他像许多男人一样，由于对美貌抱有莫名其妙的偏爱，结果娶了一个愚不可及的女人，这就使他的脾气变得有点乖戾了＿＿不过她知道，这种错误太司空见惯了，凡是有点理智的人都不会没完没了地痛苦下去。她以为，他大概是一心想出人头地，才那样鄙视一切人，非难眼前的一切事物。这是一心想表现得高人一等。这种动机十分普通，不足为怪。可是方法则不然，尽管可以使他在缺乏教养上高人一等，却不可能使任何人喜爱他，只有他的妻子例外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr. Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. "He isalways out of humour."</div>

It was impossible for any one to be morethoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs. Palmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of herhusband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she washighly diverted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing thesubject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable that asthey lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give somemore particular account of Willoughby's general character, than couldbe gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him; and shewas eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits asmight remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She began byinquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whetherthey were intimately acquainted with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺只好再次谢绝她的邀请，并且趁机转了话题，结束了她的恳求。她觉得，帕尔默夫人与威洛比既然是同乡，或许能具体地介绍一下他的整个为人，而不只是米德尔顿夫妇那点一鳞半爪的材料。她热切地希望有人来证实一番他的优点，以解除她对玛丽安的忧虑。她开头先问他们是不是在克利夫兰常常见到威洛比，是不是与他交情很深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer; --"Notthat I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town. Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he wasat Allenham. Mama saw him here once before; -- but I was with my uncleat Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal ofhim in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that weshould never have been in the country together. He is very little atCombe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, andbesides it is such a way off. I know why you inquire about him, verywell; your sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of it, for thenI shall have her for a neighbour you know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！亲爱的，是的，我极其了解他，”帕尔默夫人回答，“说真的，我倒没同他说过话。不过我在城里总是见到他。不知道为什么，他去艾伦汉的时候，我一次也没赶上呆在巴顿。我母亲过去在这里见过他一次，可我跟舅舅住在韦默思。不过我敢说，若不是因为我们不巧一次也没一起回乡的话，我们在萨默塞特郡一定会常见到他的。我想他很少去库姆。不过，即使他常去那里，我想帕尔默先生也不会去拜访他的，因为你知道他是反对党的，况且又离得那么远。我很清楚你为什么打听他，你妹妹要嫁给他。我高兴死了，因为她要做我的邻居啦，懂吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So do I. -- He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he shouldbe so grave and so dull. Mama says HE was in love with your sistertoo. -- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardlyever falls in love with any body."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也这么觉得。他是个可爱的人，可惜太严肃、太刻板了。我母亲说，他也爱上了你妹妹。说实话，他若是真爱上你妹妹，那可是极大的面子，因为他难得爱上什么人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh-he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, sofrom that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quitedelightful, I declare! When is it to take place?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，他没说多少话。不过看他那神气，他好像知道确有其事，于是从那时起，我就确信无疑了。我敢断言，这是件大喜事！什么时候办呀？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?" saidElinor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people areacquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they allthink him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked thanMr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. Sheis a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that heis much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome andagreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don'tthink her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I thinkyou both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him to own it last night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！是的，极其熟悉。这并非说，我认为有许多人认识他，因为库姆大厦相距太远。不过我敢说，大家都认为他极其和悦。威洛比先生无论走到哪里，谁也没有他那样讨人喜欢，你可以这样告诉你妹妹。我以名誉担保，你妹妹找到他真是天大的福气。这倒不是说他找到你妹妹就不算极其幸运，因为你妹妹太漂亮、太温柔了，谁都难以匹配。不过我向你保证，我并不觉得你妹妹比你漂亮。我认为你们两人都很漂亮。帕尔默先生肯定也是这样认为的，只是昨晚我们无法让他承认罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. -- He was aparticular friend of Sir John's. I believe," she added in a low voice,"he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir Johnand Lady Middleton wished it very much. But mama did not think thematch good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it tothe Colonel, and we should have been married immediately."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，好久了，从我姐姐出嫁的时候起。他是约翰爵士的挚友。我认为，”她放低声音补充说，“假若可能的话，他本来很想娶我做妻子。约翰爵士和米德尔顿夫人很希望如此。可是我母亲觉得这门亲事不够如意，不然约翰爵士就会向上校提亲，我们当即就能结婚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It is so delightful that youshould live at the cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And Iam so glad your sister is going to be well married! I hope you will bea great deal at Combe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很高兴，我们终于相识了，”夏洛特继续说。“我希望我们永远是好朋友。你想不到我多么渴望见到你呀！你能住在乡舍里，这实在太好了！毫无疑问，没有比这更好的了！我很高兴，你妹妹就要嫁个如意郎君！我希望你常去库姆大厦，大家都说，这是个可爱的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would haveliked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for itwas before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！没有，不过，假如我母亲不反对的话，我敢说他是求之不得的。当时，他只不过见过我两次，因为我还在上学。不过，我现在幸福多了。帕尔默先生正是我喜爱的那种人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
