<div class="line_en">He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: "Crucio -- Crucio -- you can't dance forever, pretty --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利感到格雷伯克倒在他身上，赶忙使出九牛二虎之力推开狼人。这时，只见一道绿光飞来，他赶忙躲开，然后不顾一切地向混战的人群冲去。脚下好像踩到了又软又滑的什么东西，他踉跄了一下，见是两具躯体脸朝下躺在血泊之中，但他来不及细看。哈利看到了火光般飞舞的红发，是金妮正在和粗壮的食死徒阿米库斯对战。阿米库斯朝她不停地施着魔法，而她左躲右闪，阿米库斯哈哈大笑道：“钻心剜骨——钻心剜骨——你不可能永远跳来跳去的，宝贝儿——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised. The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, "It's over, time to go!" and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: it was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他纵身跃过最后十级螺旋形楼梯，落地后停住脚，举起魔杖。昏暗的灯光照着满是灰尘的走廊，好像半个屋顶都塌了。一场激烈的战斗正在他面前进行，他试图弄清是谁和谁在交战，忽然听到那个令他憎恶的声音叫道：“都结束了，该走了！”只见斯内普消失在走廊远处的拐角处，他和马尔福似乎是毫无损伤地冲了出去。哈利拔腿急追，忽有一人投身朝他扑来，原来是狼人格雷伯克。哈利还没来得及举起魔杖，格雷伯克已经扑到他身上。哈利仰天倒了下去，感到又脏又乱的头发遮住了他的脸，汗臭和血腥味灌入了他的口鼻之中，贪婪的热气喷到了他的喉咙口……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Harry, where did you come from?" Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，你从哪儿来？”金妮叫道，但哈利没有时间回答她。他低着头，向前急奔，惊险地躲过头顶上方的一个爆炸，瓦砾碎片如阵雨一般。绝不能让斯内普逃掉，他必须抓住斯内普……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的魔咒正中阿米库斯的胸口，随着一声杀猪似的嚎叫，阿米库斯的身子飞了起来，撞到对面的墙上，然后滑了下去，被挡住看不见了，因为罗恩、麦格教授和卢平正在那边各处迎战一个食死徒。更远一点儿，唐克斯和一个身材庞大的金发巫师正战得不可开交，那巫师发的咒语四处乱飞，碰到墙壁反弹出去，石头震裂了，窗户玻璃震碎了……">查看中文翻译</div>

He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone's legs. Looking around, he saw Neville's pale, round face flat against the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那边！”麦格教授喊道，哈利瞥见女食死徒阿莱克托双手护头飞奔着从走访上逃去，她哥哥紧随其后。哈利奋力追着，可是脚被什么东西绊了一下，摔了一跤，他发现自己横躺在一个人的腿上，扭头一看，竟是脸色苍白的纳威趴在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know, I'm on it!" said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，我正在追他们！”哈利说道，在地上冲着一个正在制造最多混乱的大块头金发食死徒施了一个魔咒，正中他的脸部，他发出一声痛苦的怒吼，转过身子晃了两下，吃力地跟在食死徒兄妹后面逃走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“纳威，你——？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors -- perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在拐弯处刹住脚，运动鞋踩在血迹上直打滑，斯内普已经没有影子。是不是他已经进入了有求必应屋的密室里面，还是凤凰社设了屏障，不让食死徒朝那边撤退？他飞奔着冲向下一条空空的走廊，只听见自己沉重的脚步声和咚咚的心跳声。幸好他突然看到一行带血的脚印，说明至少有一个食死徒正朝着前门的方向逃走——也许有求必应屋真的被堵上了——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know…</div>

<div class="line_en">He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他朝一个近道飞奔而去，希望超过食死徒兄妹并追上斯内普和马尔福，他们现在一定已经到达场地了。在那段隐蔽楼梯的中部，他没忘记跳过那级会消失的台阶，然后从底部的一个挂毯后面冲了出去，看到走廊里站着一群穿着睡衣、不知所措的赫奇帕奇学生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又在一个拐弯处刹住脚，正好一个咒语飞过，他连忙俯身躲到一副盔甲后面，盔甲被炸烂了。他突然看见食死徒兄妹正从大理石楼梯上往下奔逃，连忙向他们施了几个魔咒，但只击中了楼梯口画像中几个戴着假发的女巫，她们尖叫着跑进了旁边的画框。哈利从被炸烂的盔甲上跳过去，听见越来越多的尖叫声和喊叫声，好像城堡里的其他人都被惊醒了……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Out of the way!" yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“闪开！”哈利喊道，把两个男生撞到一边，奔下大理石楼梯。橡木大门被炸开了，门前的石板上沾有血痕，好几个吓呆了的学生在墙边挤成一团，其中一两个还用胳膊遮住了脸。巨大的格兰芬多沙漏被咒语击中，里面的红宝石还噼里啪啦地不停地往石板上掉……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate -- by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利飞奔过门厅，冲进外面漆黑的场地。他依稀看见三个人影正在草坪上奔跑，从外形看是大块头金发食死徒，以及跑在前面的斯内普和马尔福。一旦出了校门，他们就可以使用幻影移形了……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然有个东西狠狠地砸在哈利的后腰上，他向前栽倒了，脸重重地磕在地面上，鼻孔流出了血。他翻过身，举起魔杖，知道自己走近道超过的食死徒兄妹又追上来了……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cold night air ripped at Harry's lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利奋力急追，夜晚的凉风撕扯着他的肺。他突然看见前方一道闪光映出了那三个人的轮廓，他不知道是哪里来的光亮，仍继续狂追，还够不着向他们瞄准发射咒语——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid… not Hagrid too…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又是一道闪光，叫喊声，还击的光束，哈利知道了，是海格从他的木屋里冲了出来，正在试图阻食死徒逃跑。尽管每次呼吸都像要撕裂他的肺，胸部的刺痛像火烧火燎一样，哈利还是加快了脚步，他脑海里响着一个声音：“别让海格……别让海格也……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到这时，他才透过突然钻出云层的月牙的微笑，看见海格的巨大轮廓。金发食死徒正向这个狩猎场看守一个接一个地施着魔咒，但从巨大母亲那里继承来的强健体魄和粗厚皮肤似乎保护了海格。然而斯内普和马尔福仍在逃跑，很快就要跑出大门了，就可以幻影移形了——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Impedimenta!" he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“障碍重重！”他一边大叫，一边又翻过身，匍匐在地面上，他的魔咒奇迹般地击中了一个，那人踉跄着倒在地上，又绊倒了另一个。哈利纵身跃起，向斯内普追去……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape's head; Snape shouted, "Run, Draco!"and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有打中，红光飞过斯内普的头顶。斯内普迅速转身并大叫道：“德拉科，快跑！”他和哈利相距二十米开外，四目对视，几乎同时举起了魔杖。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid's house was on fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是斯内普躲避着咒语，在哈利的咒语还未说完前就将他击倒了。哈利打了个滚又爬了起来，却听见身后的大块头食死徒大吼道：“火焰熊熊！”随着一声爆破般的巨响，一个飞舞着的橙色火球四窜开来。海格的木屋着火了。">查看中文翻译</div>
