<div class="line_en">When they returned to the ship, Farder Coram and John Faa and the other leaders spent a long time in conference in the saloon, and Lyra went to her cabin to consult the alethiome-ter. Within five minutes she knew exactly where the bear's armor was, and why it would be difficult to get it back.</div>

<div class="line_en">She lay on her bunk thinking of that savage mighty bear, and the careless way he drank his fiery spirit, and the loneliness of him in his dirty lean-to. How different it was to be human, with one's daemon always there to talk to! In the silence of the still ship, without the continual creak of metal and timber or the rumble of the engine or the rush of water along the side, Lyra gradually fell asleep, with Pantalaimon on her pillow sleeping too.</div>

There was a faint light in the cabin that she took for moonlight, and it showed her new cold-weather furs that lay stiffly in the corner of the cabin. No sooner did she see them than she longed to try them on again.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她立刻发现，天空中出现了一种奇怪的现象。她以为是云彩，在剧烈的搅动下，不断地移动、颤动。然而，潘特莱蒙低声说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sight filled the northern sky; the immensity of it was scarcely conceivable. As if from Heaven itself, great curtains of delicate light hung and trembled. Pale green and rose-pink, and as transparent as the most fragile fabric, and at the bottom edge a profound and fiery crimson like the fires of Hell, they swung and shimmered loosely with more grace than the most skillful dancer. Lyra thought she could even hear them: a vast distant whispering swish. In the evanescent delicacy she felt something as profound as she'd felt close to the bear. She was moved by it; it was so beautiful it was almost holy; she felt tears prick her eyes, and the tears splintered the light even further into prismatic rainbows. It wasn't long before she found herself entering the same kind of trance as when she consulted the alethiometer. Perhaps, she thought calmly, whatever moves the alethiometer's needle is making the Aurora glow too. It might even be Dust itself. She thought that without noticing that she'd thought it, and she soon forgot it, and only remembered it much later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一景象占据了北方整个天空，大得几乎令人难以想像。似乎它就是从天堂里来的，由精美的灯光组成的巨大的帷幕悬在半空，甩动着。它呈淡绿色和淡粉色，跟最薄的织物一样透明；下面的边缘是浓浓的深红色，如同地狱中的烈火。它们无拘无束地摇摆着，闪着微光，比最优秀的舞蹈演员的舞姿还要优雅。莱拉觉得自己甚至能听见它们的声音：甩动时发出的浑厚、遥远、低低的飒飒声。在这轻盈、优雅之中，莱拉的心头升起一种异样的感觉，有如见到那只熊的时候产生的那种亲近之感。她被它感动了，那是如此美妙的一种感觉，近乎于神圣；她发觉自己眼里泛起了泪花，眼泪把天上的光折射得甚至更为分散，宛如五彩缤纷的彩虹。不久，她发现自己进入了一种恍惚的境界，跟她解读真理仪时的状态一样。她平静地想，推动真理仪指针运动的那个东西——不管它是什么——也许就是让极光发光的那种东西，甚至也许就是尘埃自身。虽然她的思绪里想到了这个，但她并没有意识到，而且很快就把它忘了；只是过了很长时间之后，她才记起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the Aurora's light she saw a great bird, a beautiful gray goose whose head was crowned with a flash of pure white. And yet it wasn't a bird: it was a daemon, though there was no one in sight but Lyra herself. The idea filled her with sickly fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="借着极光，莱拉看见那是一只块头很大的鸟——是一只漂亮的灰色的鹅，头顶上闪着一道纯白色的光。然而，它并不是一般的鸟，而是一个精灵——尽管在场的除了莱拉并没有第二个人。一想到这个，莱拉就感到一种很不舒服的恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But something was moving across it, and as she tried to focus her eyes on the movement, she felt faint and dizzy, because the little thing moving wasn't part of the Aurora or of the other universe behind it. It was in the sky over the roofs of the town. When she could see it clearly, she had come fully awake and the sky city was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，的确有什么东西正在横渡那个港口。莱拉试图盯着那个移动的东西仔细看看，但却感到一阵眩晕，因为那个移动的小东西并不是极光的一部分，也不属于极光后面的那个不同的世界，它就在这个镇子的上空。等她看清楚的时候，她就完全清醒了，空中的那座城市也就消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And as she gazed, the image of a city seemed to form itself behind the veils and streams of translucent color: towers and domes, honey-colored temples and colonnades, broad boulevards and sunlit parkland. Looking at it gave her a sense of vertigo, as if she were looking not up but down, and across a gulf so wide that nothing could ever pass over it. It was a whole universe away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在她目不转睛地看着的时候，在那道轻纱和流动着的半透明的色彩后面，好像正在形成一座城市：有塔尖和圆顶，有蜂蜜色的寺庙和柱廊，有宽阔的大道，有阳光明媚的公园。莱拉看着它，觉得有点儿头晕目眩，好像并非是在仰视，而是在俯瞰，向一个宽得无法横渡的港口对面俯瞰。这是远方一个完全不同的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flying thing came closer and circled the ship on outspread wings. Then it glided down and landed with brisk sweeps of its powerful pinions, and came to a halt on the wooden deck a few yards from Lyra.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个飞着的东西靠得更近了，展开翅膀，绕着他们的船飞了一圈，然后向下滑行，强壮有力的翅膀轻轻扑打了几下，降落下来，在距莱拉几码远的木甲板上停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

No birds fly there; lemmings and foxes have fled. Hence the name Bolvangar: the fields of evil. They don't call it that. They call it 'the station.' But to everyone else it is Bolvangar."</div>

<div class="line_en">She felt angry and miserable. His badger claws dug into the earth and he walked forward. It was such a strange tormenting feeling when your daemon was pulling at the link between you; part physical pain deep in the chest, part intense sadness and love.

<div class="line_en">When they reached the harbor, lorek Byrnison dipped his head and unfastened the helmet with a claw, letting it clang on the frozen ground. Gyptians came out of the cafe, having sensed that something was going on, and watched in the gleam of the anbaric lights on the ship's deck as lorek Byrnison shrugged off the rest of his armor and left it in a heap on the quayside. Without a word to anyone he padded to the water and slipped into it without a ripple, and vanished.</div>

<div class="line_en">So in less than half an hour, the expedition was on its way northward. Under a sky peopled with millions of stars and a glaring moon, the sledges bumped and clattered over the ruts and stones until they reached clear snow at the edge of town. Then the sound changed to a quiet crunch of snow and creak of timber, and the dogs began to step out eagerly, and the motion became swift and smooth.</div>

It took him less than a minute, and this time there was no harsh scream of rust.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ahead of them, over the mountains to the north, the pale arcs and loops of the Northern Lights began to glow and tremble. Lyra saw through half-closed eyes, and felt a sleepy thrill of perfect Happiness, to be speeding north under the Aurora. Pantalaimon struggled against her sleepiness, but it was too strong; he curled up as a mouse inside her hood. He could tell her when they woke, and it was probably a marten, or a dream, or some kind of harmless local spirit; but something was following the train of sledges, swinging lightly from branch to branch of the close-clustering pine trees, and it put him uneasily in mind of a monkey.</div>
