<div class="line_en">The College owned farms and estates all over England. It was said that you could walk from Oxford to Bristol in one direction and London in the other, and never leave Jordan land. In every part of the kingdom there were dye works and brick kilns, forests and atomcraft works that paid rent to Jordan, and every quarter-day the bursar and his clerks would tot it all up, announce the total to Concilium, and order a pair of swans for the feast. Some of the money was put by for reinvestment-Concilium had just approved the purchase of an office block in Manchester -- and the rest was used to pay the Scholars' modest stipends and the wages of the servants (and the Parslows, and the other dozen or so families of craftsmen and traders who served the College), to keep the wine cellar richly filled, to buy books and anbarographs for the immense library that filled one side of the Melrose Quadrangle and extended, burrow-like, for several floors beneath the ground, and, not least, to buy the latest philosophical apparatus to equip the chapel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jordan College was the grandest and richest of all the colleges in Oxford. It was probably the largest, too, though no one knew for certain. The buildings, which were grouped around three irregular quadrangles, dated from every period from the early Middle Ages to the mid-eighteenth century. It had never been planned; it had grown piecemeal, with past and present overlapping at every spot, and the final effect was one of jumbled and squalid grandeur. Some part was always about to fall down, and for five generations the same family, the Parslows, had been employed full time by the College as masons and scaffolders. The present Mr. Parslow was teaching his son the craft; the two of them and their three workmen would scramble like industrious termites over the scaffolding they'd erected at the corner of the library, or over the roof of the chapel, and haul up bright new blocks of stone or rolls of shiny lead or balks of timber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在牛津大学的各个学院中，乔丹学院最为富丽堂皇，也最为富有。也许它还是最大的学院，尽管这一点谁也拿不准。学院的建筑环绕在三个不规则的四方庭院周围，从中世纪早期到十八世纪中期各个时期的建筑都有。学院从来没有过规划，而是一点一点地发展起来的，每一个地方都有古代和当代的建筑重叠交错，这样做的最终结果便是一种杂乱无章、肮脏污秽的辉煌。有的地方一直像是要倒塌的样子，帕斯洛一家已经连续五代人受雇于乔丹学院，既是石匠，又负责搭建脚手架。现在的帕斯洛先生正在向他的儿子传授这门手艺；父子俩和他们的三个帮手像勤劳的蚂蚁一样，在他们竖立在图书馆角落的脚手架上、在教堂的屋顶上奋力攀缘，向上拖拽着一块块崭新光亮的石料、一卷卷亮闪闪的导线或一根根横梁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had daemons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. Lyra imagined the Chaplain speaking loftily, listening to the star daemons' remarks, and then nodding judiciously or shaking his head in regret. But what might be passing between them, she couldn't conceive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于什么叫实验神学，莱拉知道的一点儿也不比那些野孩子多。在她自己的想像中，实验神学跟魔法有关，跟星星和行星的运动有关，跟物质小小的分子有关，但实际上这只是她的猜测而已。也许星星和人类一样，也有精灵，而实验神学就是关于如何跟他们对话的学问。在莱拉的想像中，神父说话时神态高贵，倾听着星星精灵的话，然后睿智地点着头，或者遗憾地摇着头。但他们之间可能在谈些什么，莱拉却想像不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was important to keep the chapel up to date, because Jordan College had no rival, either in Europe or in New France, as a center of experimental theology. Lyra knew that much, at least. She was proud of her College's eminence, and liked to boast of it to the various urchins and ragamuffins she played with by the canal or the claybeds; and she regarded visiting Scholars and eminent professors from elsewhere with pitying scorn, because they didn't belong to Jordan and so must know less, poor things, than the humblest of Jordan's under-Scholars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让学院的教堂拥有最新式的设备，这一点是非常重要的，因为作为实验神学的中心，不管是在欧洲还是在新法兰西，乔丹学院没有任何可以与之匹敌的对手。莱拉至少是知道这些的，她很为自己杰出的学院感到骄傲，喜欢向那些跟自己一起在运河边或粘土河床上玩耍的野孩子和衣衫褴褛的孩子吹嘘乔丹学院；她也看不起那些来自其他地方的访问学者、知名教授，因为他们不是乔丹学院的人，所以他们的知识还不如乔丹最卑微的准院士们的多，他们所了解的也只不过是无关紧要的事情而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nor was she particularly interested. In many ways Lyra was a barbarian. What she liked best was clambering over the College roofs with Roger, the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war. Just as she was unaware of the hidden currents of politics running below the surface of College affairs, so the Scholars, for their part, would have been unable to see the rich seething stew of alliances and enmities and feuds and treaties which was a child's life in Oxford. Children playing together: how pleasant to see! What could be more innocent and charming?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对此也并不特别感兴趣。从很多方面来说，她都是个野孩子。她最喜欢的是跟最好的朋友、厨房里的小学徒罗杰一起爬到学院的房顶上，朝过往的院士们头顶上吐李子核，趴在正在上辅导课的教室的窗户外面学猫头鹰叫，在狭窄的街道上相互追打，在市场上偷苹果，或者打架。就像她并不知道学院各种事物的表面下潜藏着的政治暗流一样，院士们也看不到牛津的孩子们生活中丰富而又不断的结盟、结仇、争斗和妥协。他们只是想，孩子们在一起玩耍，这多么令人惬意！还有比这更天真无邪、更令人心醉的吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, of course, Lyra and her peers were engaged in deadly warfare. There were several wars running at once. The children (young servants, and the children of servants, and Lyra) of one college waged war on those of another. Lyra had once been captured by the children of Gabriel College, and Roger and their friends Hugh Lovat and Simon Parslow had raided the place to rescue her, creeping through the Precentor's garden and gathering armfuls of small stone-hard plums to throw at the kidnappers. There were twenty-four colleges, which allowed for endless permutations of alliance and betrayal. But the enmity between the colleges was forgotten in a moment when the town children attacked a colleger: then all the collegers banded together and went into battle against the townies. This rivalry was hundreds of years old, and very deep and satisfying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，莱拉和她的同龄人也毫无例外地卷入了势不两立的争斗之中。同时进行的有好几场争斗。一所学院的孩子（年轻的仆人、仆人的孩子还有莱拉）同另一所学院的孩子打架。莱拉曾经被加布里埃尔学院虚构的另一所牛津学院。的孩子俘虏了，罗杰跟他们的朋友休·洛瓦特和西蒙·帕斯洛对关押她的地方进行突袭，来营救莱拉。他们从唱诗班领唱神父的花园里偷偷地摸进去，收集了许许多多坚硬的李子，去打那些绑架她的孩子。牛津一共有二十四所学院，这样，反复无常的结盟与背叛便永无尽头了。但是，一旦牛津镇的孩子攻击某个学院的孩子，他们就会忘记学院之间的敌意，各个学院的孩子便会联合起来，一起对付那些镇上的人。这种对抗已经存在了几百年，仇怨很深，但也很令人满足。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But even this was forgotten when the other enemies threatened. One enemy was perennial: the brickburners' children, who lived by the claybeds and were despised by collegers and townies alike. Last year Lyra and some townies had made a temporary truce and raided the claybeds, pelting the brickburners' children with lumps of heavy clay and tipping over the soggy castle they'd built, before rolling them over and over in the clinging substance they lived by until victors and vanquished alike resembled a flock of shrieking golems.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，当别的敌人构成威胁的时候，即使这样的争斗也被搁在了一边。有一股敌人一年四季都有，那就是烧砖人的孩子。他们居住在粘土河床附近，学院里和镇上的孩子非常讨厌他们。去年，莱拉同镇上的一些孩子临时停战，一起对粘土河床发动袭击，朝那些烧砖人的孩子投掷沉重的粘土块儿，把他们建成的、还没有干透的城堡踢倒，然后再把他们摔倒在地上，在他们居住的粘土附近翻来滚去。最终，胜利者和被征服者都成了一群尖叫的泥人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other regular enemy was seasonal. The gyptian families, who lived in canal boats, came and went with the spring and autumn fairs, and were always good for a fight. There was one family of gyptians in particular, who regularly returned to their mooring in that part of the city known as Jericho, with whom Lyra'd been feuding ever since she could first throw a stone. When they were last in Oxford, she and Roger and some of the other kitchen boys from Jordan and St. Michael's College had laid an ambush for them, throwing mud at their brightly painted narrowboat until the whole family came out to chase them away -- at which point the reserve squad under Lyra raided the boat and cast it off from the bank, to float down the canal, getting in the way of all the other water traffic while Lyra's raiders searched the boat from end to end, looking for the bung. Lyra firmly believed in this bung. If they pulled it out, she assured her troop, the boat would sink at once; but they didn't find it, and had to abandon ship when the gyptians caught them up, to flee dripping and crowing with triumph through the narrow lanes of Jericho.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们另一股常规的敌人则是季节性的。吉卜赛人家家都住在运河里的船上，他们随着春天和秋天的市集来来往往，而且总是擅长打仗。尤其是有一家吉卜赛人，他们经常回到他们在城里的一个叫做杰里科的码头。从莱拉能扔第一颗石子的时候起，她就一直跟他们打架。上一次他们来牛津的时候，她、罗杰还有乔丹学院和圣·麦克尔学院的几个厨房学徒对他们进行了一次伏击，往他们漆得铮亮的运河船上扔泥巴，后来，他们全家出动，把他们撵跑了——趁这个机会，莱拉率领的预备队冲上那条船，解开缆绳，驶离岸边，沿着运河漂了下去，水上交通全都被他们堵住了。与此同时，莱拉的突击队员们从船头搜到船尾，寻找船底的塞子。莱拉坚信船上是有着这么个塞子的，她跟她的队员们信誓旦旦地说，如果把塞子拔出来，船马上就会沉下去。但是，他们并没有找到，后来吉卜赛人追了过来，他们只好弃了船，沿着杰里科狭窄的胡同，带着胜利的喜悦，浑身湿漉漉地、幸灾乐祸地大叫着逃走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So she had passed her childhood, like a half-wild cat. The only variation in her days came on those irregular occasions when Lord Asriel visited the College. A rich and powerful uncle was all very well to boast about, but the price of boasting was having to be caught by the most agile Scholar and brought to the Housekeeper to be washed and dressed in a clean frock, following which she was escorted (with many threats) to the Senior Common Room to have tea with Lord Asriel and an invited group of senior Scholars. She dreaded being seen by Roger. He'd caught sight of her on one of these occasions and hooted with laughter at this beribboned and pink-frilled vision. She had responded with a volley of shrieking curses that shocked the poor Scholar who was escorting her, and in the Senior Common Room she'd slumped mutinously in an armchair until the Master told her sharply to sit up, and then she'd glowered at them all till even the Chaplain had to laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，她像只野猫似的打发着自己的童年。只有当阿斯里尔勋爵时不时地光临学院的时候，她的生活才会出现变化。有这样一位富裕而又有权势的叔叔，这就足以令她大肆吹嘘了，但是这样夸耀的代价却是要被最为敏捷的院士抓住，被带到女管家那里，被迫洗澡，穿上干净的裙子，然后，有人领着她（还不断地威胁她），到教师活动室去陪阿斯里尔勋爵以及一群应邀而来的高级院士喝茶。她非常害怕被罗杰看见。罗杰曾经在这样的场合见过她一次，然后便大声嘲笑她身上的饰带和衣服上粉红色的荷叶边。她则用尖声怒骂予以回敬，陪着她的那位可怜的院士着实被吓了一大跳。在教师活动室里，她抗议似地倒在太师椅上，最后，惹得院长只好厉声让她坐起来；这时候，她便对所有的人都怒目而视，最后连神父都忍不住笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was Lyra's world and her delight. She was a coarse and greedy little savage, for the most part. But she always had a dim sense that it wasn't her whole world; that part of her also belonged in the grandeur and ritual of Jordan College; and that somewhere in her life there was a connection with the high world of politics represented by Lord Asriel. All she did with that knowledge was to give herself airs and lord it over the other urchins. It had never occurred to her to find out more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是莱拉的世界和她的乐趣。在很大程度上，她是个野蛮、贪婪的小野人。但是，她一直蒙地觉得，这并不是她的全部世界；她的一部分还属于乔丹学院的辉煌与礼仪，在她生命中的某一个地方，她会同以阿斯里尔勋爵为代表的高层政治联系起来。对这些直觉，她所作的只不过是让自己傲慢起来，并在那些野孩子面前称王称霸；她从来没想过要去做更多的探索。">查看中文翻译</div>

After the tea, the Master and the other few Scholars who'd been invited left Lyra and her uncle together, and he called her to stand in front of him and tell him what she'd learned since his last visit.

His surname is Greek, but like his age, that is a guess on his mother's part, because he looks more Chinese than Greek, and there's Irish and Skraeling and Lascar in him from his mother's side too. Tony's not very bright, but he has a sort of clumsy tenderness that sometimes prompts him to give his mother a rough hug and plant a sticky kiss on her cheeks. The poor woman is usually too fuddled to start such a procedure herself; but she responds warmly enough, once she realizes what's happening.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, that was a distraction; Lyra was still intent on playing Gobblers, and she inveigled Roger down into the wine cellars, which they entered by means of the Butler's spare set of keys. Together they crept through the great vaults where the College's Tokay and Canary, its Burgundy, its brantwijn were lying under the cobwebs of ages. Ancient stone arches rose above them supported by pillars as thick as ten trees, irregular flagstones lay underfoot, and on all sides were ranged rack upon rack, tier upon tier, of bottles and barrels. It was fascinating. With Gobblers forgotten again, the two children tiptoed from end to end holding a candle in trembling fingers, peering into every dark corner, with a single question growing more urgent in Lyra's mind every moment: what did the wine taste like?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这并不是正事，莱拉还是想玩饕餮游戏。她连蒙带哄地让罗杰去下面的酒窖里，并且用管家的备用钥匙进入了酒窖。他们一起蹑手蹑脚地走在巨大的酒窖里，多年的蜘蛛网下面存放着学院的托考依酒、加那利葡萄酒、勃艮第葡萄酒和白兰地。古老的拱形天棚在它们上方高高隆起，下面有十根树那么粗的柱子支撑着，脚下铺的是不规则的石板，四周整齐地排列着一架架层层叠叠的酒瓶和酒桶，极富吸引力。两个孩子把饕餮又忘到了脑后，小心翼翼地从酒窖的一头走到另一头，用颤抖的手举着蜡烛，盯着每一个黑暗的角落。时间在一分一秒地过去，有一个问题在莱拉的脑子变得愈来愈急切：这些酒是什么味的？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was an easy way of answering that. Lyra -- over Roger's fervent protests -- picked out the oldest, twistiest, greenest bottle she could find, and, not having anything to extract the cork with, broke it off at the neck. Huddled in the furthest corner, they sipped at the heady crimson liquor, wondering when they'd become drunk, and how they'd tell when they were. Lyra didn't like the taste much, but she had to admit how grand and complicated it was. The funniest thing was watching their two daemons, who seemed to be getting more and more muddled: falling over, giggling senselessly, and changing shape to look like gargoyles, each trying to be uglier than the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回答这个问题的方式是非常简单的。莱拉不顾罗杰的强烈反对，精挑细选了一个她所能找到的年代最久、形状最奇、颜色最绿的瓶子。没有可以拔塞子的工具，他们便把瓶子从瓶颈处打碎。两个人蜷缩在最远处的角落，一边小口地喝着深红色的烈酒，一边在想他们什么时候会醉、怎样才能知道自己喝醉了。莱拉并不十分喜欢它的味道，但她也不得不承认这酒非常浓，什么味道都有。最滑稽的是他们俩的精灵，只见他们好像变得愈来愈笨拙，不断地摔倒、傻笑，把自己的外形变换成怪兽的模样，比赛谁比谁更难看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="终于，两个孩子几乎同时明白喝醉了酒是怎么回事了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lyra learned nothing from that episode except that playing Gobblers led to interesting places. She remembered her uncle's words in their last interview, and began to explore underground, for what was above ground was only a small fraction of the whole. Like some enormous fungus whose root system extended over acres, Jordan (finding itself jostling for space above ground with St. Michael's College on one side, Gabriel College on the other, and the University Library behind) had begun, sometime in the Middle Ages, to spread below the surface. Tunnels, shafts, vaults, cellars, staircases had so hollowed out the earth below Jordan and for several hundred yards around it that there was almost as much air below ground as above; Jordan College stood on a sort of froth of stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这件事里，除了知道玩饕餮游戏让她去了一个十分有趣的地方之外，莱拉什么也没有学到。她想起了上次和叔叔见面时他说过的话，于是便开始到地下探险，因为地上的建筑只是乔丹学院一小部分。就像有的大蘑菇的根系绵延数英亩地一样，在中世纪的某一个时期，乔丹学院便开始向地下扩张（因为当时学院发现自己在地面上跟一侧的圣·麦克尔学院、另一侧的加布里埃尔学院、后侧的大学图书馆争起了地盘）。地道、竖井、地下室、地窖、楼梯掏空了乔丹学院的地下，在几百码范围之内，地上和地下的空间几乎一样大；乔丹学院有点儿像建在石头气泡上似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now that Lyra had the taste for exploring it, she abandoned her usual haunt, the irregular alps of the College roofs, and plunged with Roger into this netherworld.

Once she tried to play a trick on some of the dead Scholars, by switching around the coins in their skulls so they were with the wrong daemons. Pantalaimon became so agitated at this that he changed into a bat and flew up and down uttering shrill cries and flapping his wings in her face, but she took no notice: it was too good a joke to waste. She paid for it later, though. In bed in her narrow room at the top of Staircase Twelve she was visited by a night-ghast, and woke up screaming at the three robed figures who stood at the bedside pointing their bony fingers before throwing back their cowls to show bleeding stumps where their heads should have been. Only when Pantalaimon became a lion and roared at them did they retreat, backing away into the substance of the wall until all that was visible was their arms, then their horny yellow-gray hands, then their twitching fingers, then nothing.

<div class="line_cn" title="这句话一下子招来了一大群孩子。其他到处寻找比利的人也都加入到他们当中，很快就聚齐了三十多个吉卜赛孩子。他们从码头的这头跑到那头，从一个马厩出来又进到另一个马厩，爬上船厂的起重机和起重塔，跳过篱笆来到开阔的牧场，在绿色水面上那座古老的平旋桥上大幅度地荡来荡去，在杰里科狭窄的街道上飞快地跑过，穿过两旁的梯形小砖房，跑到药剂师圣·巴纳巴斯的方塔大教堂里。他们当中有一半人并不知道在找什么，只是觉得好玩儿。但是，离莱拉最近的那些人一瞥见一个孤独的身影在胡同里走过或是在教堂前的阴影里停留，心头便感到一种切实的恐惧和担心：那是不是一个饕餮？">查看中文翻译</div>

The spires and towers of Oxford stood around them, level but no higher; the green woods of Chateau-Vert and White Ham rose on either side to the east and the west. Rooks were cawing somewhere, and bells were ringing, and from the oxpens the steady beat of a gas engine announced the ascent of the evening Royal Mail zeppelin for London.
