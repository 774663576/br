<div class="line_en">One day he said to her, "Listen, dear woman, I've thought it through, and I know how the two of us can spend an entire day together. On Wednesday tell your husband that you are sick and lie down in bed moaning and groaning. Carry on like that until Sunday, when in my sermon I will preach that if anyone has a sick child at home, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother, or anyone else, then that person should make a pilgrimage to Mount Cuckoo in Italy. There, for a kreuzer, one can get a peck of laurel leaves, and this person's sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or anyone else, will be healed on the spot."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll do it," said the peasant's wife. So on Wednesday she went to bed, moaning and groaning. Her husband did everything for her that he could think of, but nothing helped. Sunday arrived, and the peasant's wife said, "I'm so miserable that I must be near death, but before I die, I would like to hear the sermon that the priest is going to give today."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我会想法子的。」农妇立即答应。礼拜三一到，农妇就按商定的办法躺在床上大声地呻吟，不停地折腾，她的丈夫为她想尽了办法，可丝毫不见效，礼拜天到了，农妇嘱咐：「我已经病入膏肓，来日不多了，我想在临死前作一件事，就是聆听牧师今天的布道。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No one was happier than the peasant, and immediately following the mass he went to the priest and asked for the laurel sack and the kreuzer. Then he went home, and even before going inside called out, "Hurrah! My dear wife, you are just as good as cured. The priest preached today that whoever has a sick child at home, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother, or anyone else, then that person should make a pilgrimage to Mount Cuckoo in Italy, where a peck of laurel leaves costs one kreuzer, and this person's sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or anyone else, will be healed on the spot, and I got the laurel sack and the kreuzer from the priest, and am going to take off immediately, so you can get better as soon as possible."

<div class="line_cn" title="听完牧师的一番话，最高兴的就数农夫了，他随即找到牧师，拿到装桂树叶的口袋和铜板。事情办妥后，他就往家走，还没进家门就喊道：「哈哈！亲爱的老婆，现在你简直就跟病好了一样！牧师在布道中说无论谁家里有生病的孩子、生病的丈夫、生病的老婆、生病的父亲、生病的母亲、生病的兄弟姐妹或其他任何病人，谁就要去意大利的高克利山朝圣，在那里用一个铜板买一配克的桂树叶，生病的孩子、生病的丈夫、生病的老婆、生病的父亲、生病的母亲、生病的兄弟姐妹或其他任何病人马上就会药到病除，恢复健康，我现在已经从牧师那儿拿到口袋和铜板，为了你早日康复，我这就起程。」说完他就走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Listen, kinsman," said the peasant's kinsman. "Don't be so simple as to believe that. Do you know what? The priest wants to spend an entire day alone with your wife. He has given you this task just to get you out from under his feet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「听着，侃友，」鸡蛋贩子对农夫说，「你是真的傻到连这种鬼话都相信吗？你知道那意味甚么吗？牧师想和你老婆单独风流一天，不愿意被别人看见，所以他编造了个借口把你支开。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In all eternity!" said the peasant. "My wife has become sick, and today in the priest's sermon I heard that if anyone has a sick child at home, a sick husband, a sick wife, a sick father, a sick mother, a sick sister, brother, or anyone else, then that person should make a pilgrimage to Mount Cuckoo in Italy, where a peck of laurel leaves costs one kreuzer, and this person's sick child, sick husband, sick wife, sick father, sick mother, sick sister, brother, or anyone else, will be healed on the spot, and I got the laurel sack and the kreuzer from the priest, and now I am on my way."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当他们到家时，啊哈！这里可真是热闹非凡呀！农家院里的家禽几乎都被农妇杀光了，她还烙了薄饼，牧师也在场，他随身带着提琴。侃友敲敲门，农妇问道是谁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," said the peasant's wife, "you have come at a very inconvenient time, but it can't be helped. Just sit down over there on the bench by the stove."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's me, kinswoman," said the kinsman. "Can you give me shelter for the night? I did not sell my eggs at the market, so now I have to carry them back home, but they are too heavy, and I can't make it. It is already dark."</div>
