<div class="line_en">He drank his coffee, and before he went, he advised Davies in a fatherly way to think again about going home before the winter began. Davies went with him back to his own boat, but returned at once, and sat down opposite me in the cabin. I think he knew what was coming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喝完咖啡，走之前又像慈父一般劝告戴维斯，让他再考虑考虑冬季到来之前就回国。戴维斯陪他回到他的船上，不过马上又回来了，在船舱里跟我面对面坐下。我想他知道接下来要发生什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What was he like?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他什么样子？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here's Norderney," he said, spreading out the chart. "There's a harbour at the west end of the island, the only real harbour on the islands. The Medusa was anchored near it and I rowed over after dinner, and was taken to the main cabin. It was very grand. Dollmann was finishing dinner."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“诺德奈在这儿。”他展开海图说，“这座岛的西头有个港口，也是弗里西亚群岛唯一真正的港口。‘美杜莎’号就停泊在港口附近。晚饭后我划着小艇过去，被领进了主舱，那里面很豪华。多尔曼差不多吃完晚饭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"About fifty, tall and thin, with grey hair and a short grey beard," replied Davies. "I asked about the duck shooting, and he said that there was none at all. But he wanted to know all about me and what I was doing there. We talked for a long time and he was quite friendly when I left. I intended to sail on eastwards next day, but Dollmann came to visit me on the Dulcibella, and then invited me to dinner on the Medusa a couple of times. In the end I stayed three more days anchored at Norderney."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“50岁上下，瘦高个子，头发花白，蓄着花白的短胡子。”戴维斯回答，“我问他打野鸭的事儿，他说根本没有野鸭可打。不过他倒想了解我这个人，还有我在那地方做什么。我们聊了很久，我走的时候他表现得非常友好。我本打算第二天就向东航行，可多尔曼来‘达尔茜贝拉’号上拜访了我，还请我去‘美杜莎’号上吃了几顿饭。结果我的船又在诺德奈多停留了三天。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What was she like?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她什么样呢？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh! A very nice girl," he replied, turning a little pink. "Finally, we left Norderney together. Dollmann said the Baltic would be better for duck shooting. We agreed to sail together as far as Cuxhaven. He was sailing to Hamburg and I was going to take the new ship canal to Kiel. It's about a hundred kilometres from Norderney to Cuxhaven."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢！她是个很好的姑娘。”他的脸微微泛红，“最后我们一起从诺德奈起航，多尔曼说波罗的海更适合打野鸭。我们说好一起航行到库克斯港，因为他要去汉堡，而我要取道那条新运河去基尔。从诺德奈到库克斯港大概有100公里的距离。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies paused, looking at the chart. "We left on the morning of 13th September," he began again. "The weather was bad, and there was a strong wind from the north-west. It was nothing for a big yacht like his, of course, but I soon realized I had been a fool to set out. After Wangeroog, the last of the islands, the wind got really strong, but it was too late to turn back by then. The sand stretches twenty-five kilometres from Cuxhaven right out to the Scharhörn, so you have to go round the Scharhörn to reach Cuxhaven, and I knew the sea would be extremely rough there. Suddenly I saw the Medusa was waiting for me to get closer. As I reached her, Dollmann shouted to me, slowly and clearly, 'It's too rough for you to go round the Scharhörn. Follow me. I'll show you a short cut through the sandbanks.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯停下来看了看海图。“我们是9月13号早上动身的。”他接着说道，“天气很差，刮着猛烈的西北风。这对于多尔曼的大游艇来说当然不算什么，但我很快就意识到，这种天气我的船真不应该开出去。到了旺格岛，也就是群岛中的最后一座时，风变得极猛，但那时再掉头已经来不及了。库克斯港和沙尔赫恩岛之间全是沙子，有25公里长，因此要绕过沙尔赫恩岛才能到达库克斯港，而我知道那片海域风浪会特别大。突然，我看见‘美杜莎’号正等着我靠近。我驶到它近旁时，多尔曼一字一顿地向我喊道：‘你绕行沙尔赫恩岛太危险了！跟我走吧！我带你走沙洲中间的近路。’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Davies paused, to point out the places on the chart. "Look, here's the Telte, it's a wide channel through the sands. It's all right if you know your way, but later on it's cut in two by the Hohenhörn sandbank, and it gets very shallow and difficult. Dollmann seemed to know what he was doing, so, after a moment's thought, I held up my arm to show that I would follow him. You asked me if I ever took a pilot. That was the only time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯停下来，指着海图上的地方给我看：“看，这是泰尔特，沙洲中间一条宽阔的水道，要是认路的话其实没问题。可是后来这条水路被霍恩霍恩沙洲截成了两段，变得又浅又难走。多尔曼似乎很有把握，所以我想了一想，便举起胳膊示意我会跟着他。你问我有没有跟引航员走过，就只有那一次。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Suddenly I saw the waves breaking on the Hohenhörn right in front of me. I tried to steer along the edge of the sandbank, hoping to find a way through. But the wind carried the Dulcibella violently on to the sandbank. The next wave carried me further on to the bank and into a little channel. I can't describe the next few minutes. My hand had been hurt, and the helm damaged, in that first bump, and I had no control over the boat. The waves were crashing all around me, and finally I ran aground."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“忽然，我看到霍恩霍恩沙洲就在眼前，浪花四溅。我努力把船沿着沙洲边缘开，想找个办法脱险，可船却在狂风的作用下重重地撞在了沙洲上。又一波海浪袭来，船被推得更远，直撞进一条狭窄的水道里。接下来的几分钟就无法用语言形容了。第一次撞击时我的手就受了伤，舵轮也坏了，我完全控制不了船。海浪从四面八方涌来，船最终搁了浅。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies spoke bitterly. "I followed him into the Telte channel, but then I saw he wasn't waiting for me. The Medusa was sailing much faster than I could, and soon disappeared into the mist and rain. There was nothing I could do. I couldn't turn round and go back. At high tide, as it was then, all the sand is covered, so you can't see the sandbanks or the channels, and there are no buoys. The wind was behind me too, and was very strong by this time. It was driving me straight on to the Hohenhörn sandbank."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯话语中带着愤恨。“我跟着他驶入泰尔特水道，但接下来发现他并没有等我。‘美杜莎’号当时的速度非常快，我根本跟不上。很快，它就消失在蒙蒙雨雾中了。我束手无策，也不能掉头开回去。当时正在涨潮，沙洲全都藏在水下，分不清哪里是沙洲、哪里是航道，也没有浮标指示。背后风正猛，推着我的船直直地朝霍恩霍恩沙洲撞去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“间谍？”我问，“你是什么意思？什么间谍——哪儿的间谍？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He said it very simply, and I stared at him in astonishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他最后这句话说得言简意赅。我惊讶地注视着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies shook his head. "I was so angry with myself, you can't imagine. I couldn't do anything because my hand was useless. But that's when Bartels saw me and came to help. He'd taken shelter in a deeper part of the channel that I was in. He saw I was in difficulties, so he and his boy rowed across to me. They soon had the sails down, and pulled me away from the sand and down the channel, to where the Johannes lay. He's a good man, Bartels. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯摇了摇头。“你不知道我有多生自己的气。我的手废掉了，什么都做不了。但就在那时，巴特尔斯发现了我，赶来相助。他正在水道的深水段躲避风浪，看见我遇到危险，就和他的伙计划着小艇来到我身边。他们很快帮我收起帆，把我的船拽离沙洲，沿着水道一直拖到‘约翰内斯’号停泊的地方。巴特尔斯是个好人，要不是他，我现在就不在这儿了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The next day he helped me repair the damage to the helm. He was sailing for the Eider River and on to the Baltic that way. It's longer than going by the new ship canal but both routes come out at Kiel. I went with him, and three days later I was in the Baltic. I wrote to you a week after I got there. You see, by then I had realized that Dollmann was a spy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二天，他帮我修好了坏掉的舵轮。他之前往那个方向航行，是要经艾德河去波罗的海。这样比走新运河远些，但两条路最后都能到达基尔。我便和他一起航行，三天后到达波罗的海，又过了一周给你写了信。你知道吗？到那时我已经意识到多尔曼 是个间谍。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你确定吗？”这番话真令人难以置信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes!" said Davies calmly. "I've worked it all out. Dollmann knew his way through the sands, by the Telte channel, and his yacht was big enough to manage it. You see, the Telte divides into two before the Hohenhörn sandbank. Dollmann turned north and then into the channel that goes around the Hohenhörn. But before he turned, he led me straight for the sandbank. And he deliberately left me behind, so I didn't know that he had turned. He meant me to keep going straight ahead. I should have been broken to pieces on the Hohenhörn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我确定！”戴维斯平静地说，“我前前后后都想明白了。多尔曼知道如何从泰尔特水道穿过沙洲，他的游艇也够大，能够完成这段航程。你瞧，泰尔特水道在霍恩霍恩沙洲前分成了两段，多尔曼向北一拐，就进入了一条能够绕过沙洲的航道。但他在转弯之前，却告诉我朝沙洲方向直走，接着故意把我甩在后面，这样我就不会知道他转弯了。他想让我一直往前走，在霍恩霍恩沙洲上撞个粉身碎骨。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你怎么逃过一劫的呢？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies pointed again at the chart. "Look," he said. "The Telte divides into two quite big channels, which go round the Hohenhörn to the north and the south. But there's also a very narrow channel that goes through the middle. It's so small that I hadn't noticed it, when I looked at the chart before we sailed. That's the one I was carried into. If I had been on the sandbank, the Dulcibella would have broken up in three minutes. I was just lucky that day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯又指了指海图。“看，”他说，“泰尔特水道分成两条比较宽的航道，分别从北面和南面绕过霍恩霍恩沙洲。但这里还有一条很窄的航道，从沙洲中间穿过去。这条航道太窄了，我出发前看海图时都没有注意到它。我的船就是被风刮进了这条航道里。要是船还停在沙洲上，肯定不出三分钟就被撞碎了。我那天只是幸运罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"After that he did his best to get rid of me. He said there were no ducks, that the Baltic was very good for sailing and for ducks, and he offered to show me the way. He wanted to get me away from those islands. I don't think he meant to kill me at first, but when the chance came later on, he just took it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从那之后，他就极力想除掉我。他说那里没有野鸭，波罗的海则更适合航行和猎鸭子，还主动提出要给我带路。他想让我离开那片群岛。我觉得他一开始并没打算杀死我，但后来机会来了，他便利用了这个机会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我确定。”戴维斯说，“每次我在‘美杜莎’号上和他交谈，他都讲德语。他说他只会几个英语单词。他提出要带我走沙洲之间的近路时，也是用德语喊的话。喏，你知道我从来不喜欢跟着引航员走，所以在答应之前迟疑了一下。他一定以为我没听懂他的话，于是又喊了一遍，只不过这一次是用英语，没有一丝德国口音。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's right," agreed Davies eagerly. "I knew you'd understand. I'm sure he's an Englishman, working for the German government and giving them information. He's been living here for years, and has a house on Norderney. Oh! And I met a friend of his, a Commander von Brüning, in the German navy. He came on board the Medusa one day when I was there. He's captain of the gunboat Blitz, on guard duty for the fishing boats around the islands."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是如此。”戴维斯热切地表示赞同，“我就知道你会懂的。我确定他是英国人，为德国政府工作，向他们提供情报。他住在这儿已经好多年了，在诺德奈还有栋房子。对了！我还遇到了他的一个朋友，德国海军的一位冯布吕宁艇长。有一天我在‘美杜莎’号上时，他也过来了。他是‘闪电’号炮艇的艇长，负责保护弗里西亚群岛周围的渔船。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took down a map of Germany from the shelf and spread it on the table. "Look at Germany. It's the strongest nation in Europe, and it's led by the young Kaiser, who's a great man for getting things done. Their industry is growing very fast and, in order to have markets for what they produce, they need colonies. To get and keep these colonies, and to protect their shipping, they need a strong navy. They have only a small one at present, but it's very good, and they're building more ships as fast as they can. In Britain we already have a strong navy, because we live on an island, and we need to protect the sea routes between us and our colonies. Most of our food comes to us by sea. If we lose control of the sea, we're finished. But Germany is in the very centre of Europe, and can get all she needs from her neighbours. She has the biggest army in the world. She can already compete with our industry, and soon she may be able to compete with our navy. And unfortunately, we're not ready for her. All our naval bases are on the south coast, opposite our old enemy, France. We have no bases in the North Sea. We should realize that Germany is the danger now, and do something about it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从架子上取下一张德国地图，在桌上展开。“看看德国，它是欧洲最强大的国家，年轻的皇帝做事情很有手段。他们的工业发展迅猛，为了给产品找到销路，就需要殖民地。为了夺得并管治这些殖民地，也为了保护海运，就需要强大的海军。德国现在的海军规模还小，但装备精良，而且他们还在开足马力造新船。我们英国已经有一支强大的海军，因为是个岛国，需要保护本土和殖民地之间的海上航线。我们的大部分食物都是海运过来的，假如失去了对海上的控制，我们就完了。然而，德国处于欧洲的中心，能从各个邻国得到所需要的一切。它拥有世界上最庞大的军队，工业规模已经能与我们抗衡，说不定它的海军也会很快赶上我们。不幸的是，我们还没准备好迎战这位劲敌。英国的海军基地都在南部海岸，朝向老对手法国，在北海却没有基地。我们应该意识到德国才是当前的威胁，并采取相应措施。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, very well," replied Davies. "Now," he continued, "let me explain what I think is happening."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“熟，很熟。”戴维斯回答。“好啦，”他接着说道，“让我来讲讲我对时局的分析。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Davies pointed at the map again. "Now look at the coast of Germany. It's very short and it's cut in two by Denmark. Most of the German coast is on the Baltic, which is not much use to them as it's too far from the Atlantic. That's why the Kaiser has built the new ship canal from Kiel to the River Elbe, so that he can move his ships from the Baltic to the North Sea quickly. The North Sea coast is the important one but it's very short -- three hundred kilometres at the most. And not all of it can be used. Most of the coastline is hidden behind sandbanks, or a line of islands. There's just one wide opening, with the mouths of the three big rivers, the Elbe, the Weser, and the Jade, leading to Hamburg, Bremen, and Wilhelmshaven. The important bit of coast is the hundred and twelve kilometres from Borkum to the Elbe, and that's the part that Dollmann stopped me exploring."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯又指着地图，说道：“现在咱们看看德国的海岸。它的海岸线很短，还被丹麦分成了两截。因为大部分都在波罗的海，离大西洋太远，所以作用不大。这就是为什么德国皇帝要在基尔和易北河之间修建新运河：这样他就可以快速把船只从波罗的海调拨到北海。北海的海岸线更为重要，却非常短——最多300公里，而且不是都能利用的。这段海岸线大部分隐藏在沙洲下或一列岛屿后面，只有一片宽阔的区域，那就是易北河、威悉河和亚德河三条大河的入海口，连着汉堡、不来梅和威廉斯港。这段重要的海岸线从博尔库姆到易北河，一共112公里长，也就是多尔曼阻止我去考察的地带。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies paused and looked at me anxiously. "These are not just my ideas, you know. Other people worry about this too."</div>

<div class="line_en">He paused again, looking at the sandbanks shown on the map. "If England were at war with Germany," he added, slowly and seriously, "the whole of that coast would be important, sands and all. There are channels through those sands that can only be used by small ships like Bartels" Johannes. In wartime the main sea routes to Hamburg and the other ports would be carefully guarded. But if we knew where the channels through the sands were, small gunboats could use them to attack German ships in the mouths of the big rivers. And, of course, German gunboats could use them to attack our ships off the coast. Then they could disappear among the sands, where our ships would be too big to follow them. All our warships need deep water to sail in, and can't possibly use those channels."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又停了停，看着地图上标示的沙洲。“假如英国和德国开战，”他缓缓地、严肃地说，“这整整一段海岸，包括沙洲和全部岛屿在内，都至关重要。沙洲之间那些航道，只有像巴特尔斯的‘约翰内斯’号那种小型船只才能通行。战时，通往汉堡等港口的主航线肯定会被严加把守，但假如我们知道沙洲间的航道，小型炮艇就能从那里袭击大河入海口处的德国船只。当然了，德国炮艇也能利用这些航道在近海袭击我们的船，然后躲到沙洲的隐蔽处，我们的船太大，没法追击。我们的全部军舰都只能在深水中航行，没法通过这些航道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see," I said. I began to understand what Davies was trying to tell me. "So German gunboats could travel through the sands from Hamburg to Holland, and our North Sea ships couldn't get near them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我懂了。”我开始明白了戴维斯想要表达的意思，“也就是说，德国炮艇能够穿过那些沙洲，从汉堡到达荷兰，而我们的北海军舰却无法靠近它们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right," said Davies. "Or of course, our gunboats could do the trip the other way, if we knew where the channels were. The trouble is, we don't know. None of our fishing boats use these waters and our charts are years out of date. It just happens that I enjoy sailing in waters like these and bringing the charts up to date."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这样。”戴维斯说，“当然了，假如知道这些航道的位置，英国的炮艇也可以以其人之道还治其人之身，可问题是我们不知道。我们的渔船从不来这片海域，海图也是好多年前的了。我只是凑巧喜欢在这种水域行船，乐意修正海图而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>
