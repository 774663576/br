Given Ye's status, she had no rights to the results of her research. And Lei, who had studied astrophysics, was a political officer who was also an intellectual, rare at the time. Thus he could take credit for all of Ye's research results and papers, and cast himself as an exemplary political officer with both technical acumen and revolutionary zeal.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Red Coast Project had initially requisitioned Ye because of a paper on an attempted mathematical model of the sun she had published in the Journal of Astrophysics as a graduate student. Compared to the Earth, the sun was a far simpler physical system, made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. Though its physical processes were violent, they were relatively straightforward, only fusing hydrogen into helium. Thus, it was likely that a mathematical model of the sun could describe it rather precisely. The paper was basic, but Lei and Yang saw in it a hope for a solution to a technical difficulty faced by the Red Coast monitoring system.</div>

<div class="line_en">The interference that Red Coast had to deal with was similar, but the source of interference (the sun) was between the source of the transmission (outer space) and the ground-based receiver. Compared to communication satellites, the solar outages suffered by Red Coast were more frequent and more severe. Red Coast Base as constructed was also much more modest than its original design, such that the transmission and monitoring systems shared the same antenna. This made the times available for monitoring even more precious, and solar outages even more of a problem.</div>

<div class="line_en">Solar outages, a common problem in satellite communications, had always plagued the Red Coast monitoring operations. When the Earth, an artificial satellite, and the sun are in a straight line, the line of sight from the ground-based antenna to the satellite will have the sun as its background. The sun is a giant source of electromagnetic radiation, and, as a result, satellite transmissions to the ground will be overwhelmed by interference from the solar radiation. This problem could not be completely solved, even in the twenty-first century.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lei and Yang's idea for eliminating interference was very simple: ascertain the frequency spectrum and characteristics of solar radiation in the monitored range, and then filter it out digitally. Both of them were technical, and at that time, when the ignorant often led the knowledgeable, that was a rare bit of fortune. But Yang wasn't a specialist in astrophysics, and Lei had taken the path of becoming a political officer, which prevented him from accruing in-depth technical know-how. In reality, electromagnetic radiation from the sun is only stable within the limited range from near-ultraviolet to mid-infrared (including visible light). In other ranges, the radiation is quite volatile and unpredictable. To set the right expectations, Ye made it clear in her first research report that during periods of intense solar activity -- sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and so on -- it was impossible to eliminate solar interference. Thus, her research target was limited to radiation within the frequency ranges monitored by Red Coast during periods of normal solar activity.</div>

The library could obtain foreign-language materials related to the topic, including timely European and American academic journals. In those years, this was no easy feat.

<div class="line_en">After half a year of study, Ye saw no glimpse of hope. She quickly discovered that within the frequency ranges monitored by Red Coast, solar radiation fluctuated unpredictably. By analyzing large amounts of observed data, Ye discovered a puzzling mystery. Sometimes, during one of the sudden fluctuations in solar radiation, the surface of the sun was calm. Since hundreds of thousands of kilometers of solar material would absorb any shortwave and microwave radiation originating from the core of the sun, the radiation must have come from activities on its surface, so there should have been observable surface activity when these fluctuations occurred. If there were no corresponding surface disturbances, what caused these sudden changes to the narrow frequency ranges? The more she thought about it, the more mysterious it seemed.</div>

Now that the chaos in society was finally subsiding, the demands on cadres were also changing. There was an acute need for men like him, politically mature and academically accomplished.

<div class="line_en">But in the end, Ye didn't hand in her report. She thought that if the research project were terminated, the base library would stop receiving foreign language journals and other research materials, and she would no longer have access to such a rich trove of astrophysics references. So she nominally continued her research, while in reality she focused on refining her mathematical model of the sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">Last issue, in "A New, Powerful Radiation Source Within the Solar System," Dr. Harry Peterson of Mount Wilson Observatory published a set of data accidentally obtained while observing Jupiter's precession on June 12 and July 2, during which strong electromagnetic radiation was detected, lasting 81 seconds and 76 seconds, respectively. The data included the frequency ranges of the radiation as well as other parameters. During the radio outbursts, Peterson also observed certain changes in the Great Red Spot. This discovery drew a lot of interest from planetary scientists. In this issue, G. McKenzie's article argues that it was a sign of fusion starting within Jupiter's core. In the next issue we will publish Inoue Kumoseki's article, which attributes the Jovian radio outbursts to a more complicated mechanism -- the movements of internal metallic hydrogen plates -- and gives a complete mathematical description.</div>

From the distance between the Earth and Jupiter it was easy to figure out the time it took for the radio outbursts to travel between the two.

<div class="line_en">Such were the known facts about the sun. But Ye's model led to a new result: As solar radiation dropped through these different frequencies on its way through the radiation zone, there were boundaries between the subzones for each type of radiation. As energy crossed each boundary, the radiation frequency stepped down a grade sharply. This was different from the traditional view that the radiation frequency lowered gradually as energy passed from the core outwards. Her calculations showed that these boundaries would reflect radiation coming from the lower-frequency side, which was why she named the boundaries "energy mirrors."</div>

<div class="line_en">However, there was a question: The sun must be receiving electromagnetic radiation from space every second, including radio waves emitted by the Earth. Why were only some of the waves amplified? The answer was simple: In addition to the selectivity of the energy mirrors for frequencies they would reflect, the main reason was the shielding effect of the solar convection zone. The endlessly boiling convection zone situated outside the radiation zone was the outermost liquid layer of the sun. The radio waves coming from space must first penetrate the convection zone to reach the energy mirrors in the radiation zone, where they would be amplified and reflected back out. This meant that in order to reach the energy mirrors, the waves would have to be more powerful than a threshold value. The vast majority of Earth-based radio sources could not cross this threshold, but the Jovian radio outburst did -- And Red Coast's maximum transmission power also exceeded the threshold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里出现一个问题：太阳每时每刻都在接收来自太空的电磁辐射，包括地球溢出的无线电渡，为什么它只放大其中的一部分呢？原因很明显：除了能量镜面对反射频率的选择外，主要是太阳对流层的屏蔽作用。表面沸腾不息的对流层位于辐射层之上，是太阳最外一层液态层。来自太空的电波首先要穿透对流层才能到达辐射层的能量镜面，进而被放大后反射出去。这就需要射入的电波在功率上超过一个阈值，地球上的绝大部分的无线电发射都远低于这个阈值，但木星的电磁辐射超过了——红岸的最大发射功率也超过了这个阈值！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye again made her request to the base leadership. But she didn't dare to give her real reason -- it was too fantastic, and she would have been turned down for certain. Instead, she explained that she wanted to do an experiment for her solar research: The Red Coast transmission system would be used as a solar exploration radar whose echoes could be analyzed to obtain some information about solar radiation. Lei and Yang both had deep technical backgrounds, and wouldn't have been easily fooled, but the experiment described by Ye did have real precedents in Western solar research. In fact, her suggestion was technically easier than the radar exploration of terrestrial planets already being conducted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁找到了领导，提出了这个要求，但没敢直接说出自己的想法，那太玄乎了，肯定遭到否决，她只是说这是一次对太阳研究进行的试验，将红岸发射系统作为对太阳的探测雷达，通过接收回波来分析反映太阳电磁辐射的一些信息。雷志成和杨卫宁都有很深的技术背景，想骗他们不容易，但叶文洁说出的这项试验，在西方太阳研究中确实有过先例。事实上，这比正在进行中的对类地行星的雷达探测在技术上还简单些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lei shook his head again. "I know that it's technically and operationally feasible. But you… eh, Chief Yang, you just lack the sensitivity for this kind of thing. You want to aim a superpowerful radio beam at the red sun. Have you thought about the political symbolism of such an experiment?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷政委又摇了摇头。“我知道这在技术上和操作上都是可行的。但是你……嗯，杨卫宁，你就是对这种事情缺乏敏感性。你想把一束超强的无线电波对准红日。你想过这样一个实验的政治象征吗？他说：“这是一个很好的选择。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“十几分钟吧。”雷志成说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then Red Coast has just enough time to switch from transmission mode to monitoring mode."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样红岸系统正好有时间转换到接收状态。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yang and Ye were both utterly stunned, but they did not think Lei's objection ridiculous. Just the opposite: They were horrified that they themselves had not thought of it. During those years, finding political symbolism in everything had reached absurd levels. The research reports Ye turned in had to be carefully reviewed by Lei so that even technical terms related to the sun could be repeatedly revised to remove political risk. Terms like "sunspots" were forbidden. An experiment that sent a powerful radio transmission at the sun could of course be interpreted in a thousand positive ways, but a single negative interpretation would be enough to bring political disaster on everyone. Lei's reason for refusing to allow the experiment was truly unassailable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杨卫宁和叶文洁一时瞳目结舌，他们并不是感到这理由荒唐，相反，是为自己没有想到而后怕。那个年代，对一切事物的政治图解已达了援其荒唐的程度。叶上交的研究报告，雷志成必须进行仔细审阅，对有关太阳的技术用词反复斟酌修改，像“太阳黑子”这类词汇都不能出现。向太阳发射超强电波的实验当然可以做出一千个正面解释，但只要有一个反面解释，就可能有人面临灭顶之灾。雷志成拒绝实验的这个理由，确实是不可能被推翻的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One time when she was on duty, Ye was assigned to work during one of the test transmissions after an overhaul. Because a test transmission omitted many operational steps, only Ye and five others were present. Three of them were low-level operators who knew little about the principles behind the equipment. The remaining two were a technician and an engineer, both exhausted and not paying much attention after two days of overhaul work. Ye first adjusted the test transmission power to exceed the threshold value for her gain-reflective solar energy mirror theory, using the maximum power of the Red Coast transmission system. Then she set the frequency to the value most likely to be amplified by the energy mirror. And under the guise of testing the antenna's mechanical components, she aimed it at the setting sun in the west. The content of the transmission remained the same as usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一次值班中，叶被分配进行例行的检修后的测试。由于试发射省去了很多操作，在场的除叶丈洁外只有五个人，其中三个是对设备原理知之甚少的操作员，另外的一名技术员和一名工程师已在持续了两天的检修中疲惫不堪，心不在焉。叶文洁首先将发射功率设置到刚刚超过太阳增益反射理论上的阈值（这已是红岸发射系统的最大功率了），频率设定在最可能被能量镜面放大的频率上，借测试天线机械性能为名，将它对准已斜挂在西天的太阳，发射的内容仍同每次正规发射一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ye didn't give up, though. In fact, as long as she didn't take excessive risk, it wasn't difficult to accomplish her goal. The Red Coast transmitter was ultra-high-powered, but all of its components were domestically produced during the Cultural Revolution. As the quality of the components was not up to par, the fault rate was very high. After every fifteenth transmission, the entire system had to be overhauled, and after each overhaul, there would be a test transmission. Few people attended these tests, and the targets and other parameters were arbitrarily selected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁没有放弃，其实只要冒不大的险，做成这事很容易。红岸发射系统的发射器是超高功率的设备，全部使用“文革”期间生产的国产元件，由于质量不过关，故障率很高，不得不在每十五次发射后就全面检修一次，每次检修完成后都要例行试运行，参加这种发射的人很少，目标和其他发射参数也是比较随意的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the sun set slowly in the west, Ye had to manually track it. The Red Coast antenna seemed like a giant sunflower at that moment, slowly turning to follow the descending sun. By the time the red light indicating transmission completion lit up, she was already soaked in sweat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳在西天缓缓下落，叶文浩不得不手动跟踪。这时，红岸天线像一棵巨大的向日葵，面对着下落中的太阳缓缓转动。当发射完成的红灯亮起时，她浑身已被汗水浸透了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a clear afternoon in the autumn of 1971. Afterwards, Ye recalled the event many times but couldn't remember any special feelings except anxiety, a desire for the transmission to be completed quickly. First, she was afraid to be discovered by her colleagues. Even though she had thought of some excuses, it was still unusual to use maximum power for a test transmission, because doing so would wear down the components. In addition, the Red Coast transmission system's positioning equipment was never designed to be aimed at the sun. Ye could feel the eyepiece growing hot. If it burnt out she would be in real trouble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是1971年秋天一个晴朗的下午。事后叶文洁多次回忆那一时刻，并没有什么特别的感觉，只是焦急，盼发射快些完成。一方面是怕在场的同事发现，虽然她想好了推托的理由。但以损耗元件的最大功率进行发射实验毕竟是不正常的；同时，红岸发射系统的定位设备不是设计用于瞄准太阳的，叶文洁用手就能感到光学系统在发烫。如果烧坏麻烦就大了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She glanced around. The three operators at the control panel were shutting down the equipment piece by piece in accordance with the instructions in the operating manual. The engineer was drinking a glass of water in a corner of the control room, and the technician was asleep in his chair. No matter how historians and writers later tried to portray the scene, the reality at the time was completely prosaic.</div>

<div class="line_en">The transmission completed, Ye rushed out of the control room and dashed into Yang Weining's office. Catching her breath, she said, "Tell the base station to begin monitoring the twelve thousand megahertz channel!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"What are we receiving?" Chief Yang looked in surprise at Ye, strands of hair stuck to her sweaty face. Compared to the highly sensitive Red Coast monitoring system, the conventional military-grade radio -- normally used by the base for communicating with the outside -- was only a toy.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe we'll get something. There's no time to change the Red Coast systems to monitoring mode!" Normally, warming up and switching over to the monitoring system required a little more than ten minutes. But right now the monitoring system was also being overhauled. Many modules had been taken apart and remained unassembled, rendering them inoperable in the short term.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That American astronomer responded, though." Yang took out a thick envelope covered with customs stamps and handed it to Ye. She tore the envelope open and scanned Harry Peterson's letter. The letter said that he had not imagined that there would be colleagues in China studying planetary electromagnetism, and that he wished to collaborate and exchange more information in the future. He had also sent two stacks of paper: the complete record of the waveforms of the radio outbursts from Jupiter.

So she had no choice but to carry her lunch box outside and walk next to the lip of the cliff, where she sat down on the grass to chew the cold mantou.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么，一场梦，醒了而已。”叶文洁说完又笑了笑，抱着那摞复印纸和信封走出了办公室。她回到住处，取了饭盒去食堂，才发现只剩下馒头和咸菜了。食堂的人又没好气地告诉她要关门了，她只好端着饭盒走了出来，走到那道悬崖前，坐在草地上啃着凉馒头。">查看中文翻译</div>
