<div class="line_en">Harry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fits, doesn't it?" he said. "Remember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup… I'll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he's going to be feeling really stupid now, isn't he? Didn't work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here -- I'll do it --"</div>

<div class="line_en">There's no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?" Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. "You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I'm serious."</div>

<div class="line_en">He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual -- Harry hadn't been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, "Well, we'd better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry -- Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Blimey, this is heavy," said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. "Open it, Harry, go on! Let's just see what's inside it!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn't believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he'd gotten through the first task, and he wouldn't have to face the second one for three months.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利吃了起来。这些日子，他几乎忘记什么是正常的饥饿感了。他和罗恩、赫敏一起坐了下来。他简直无法相信自己有多么开心：罗恩又回到了他身边，他通过了第一个项目，而第二个项目要三个月以后才去面对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster's Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail's head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然，当他们走进格兰芬多公共休息室时，里面又一次爆发出一片欢呼和喧哗。桌子、椅子上都堆着小山一般的蛋糕，还有一壶壶南瓜汁和黄油啤酒。李·乔丹燃放了一些费力拔焰火，空气里闪动着许多星星和火花。擅长绘画的迪安·托马斯挂起了好几条醒目的新横幅，大多数横幅上都画着哈利骑着火弩箭绕着树蜂穿梭飞翔的场面，不过也有两幅表现了塞德里克脑袋着火的情景。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in winter. Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime's horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十二月给霍格沃茨带来了狂风和雨加雪。尽管城堡里冬天总是有穿堂风，但每次哈利走过停在湖面的德姆斯特朗的大船时，都为城堡里热腾腾的炉火和厚实的墙壁感到庆幸。那艘大船在狂风中颠簸摇摆，黑色的船帆在黑暗的夜空中翻飞起舞。他想，德姆斯特朗的活动住房里一定也冷得够呛。哈利还注意到，海格给马克西姆夫人的那些骏马不断提供它们最喜欢的纯麦芽威士忌。临时马厩的角落里的饲料槽飘过来一阵阵酒味，熏得保护神奇动物课的同学们都有点晕晕乎乎的。这并没有什么好处，因为他们仍然在照料可怕的炸尾螺，需要运用一些智慧呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在只剩下十条炸尾螺了。显然，它们互相残杀的欲望并没有彻底根除。如今它们每个都接近六英尺长。它们厚厚的灰色保护层，它们胡乱摆动的有力的腿，它们不断爆炸喷火的尾巴，还有它们的刺和吸盘，所有这些加在一起，使炸尾螺成为哈利见过的最令人恶心的东西。同学们无精打采地望着海格搬出来的大箱子，箱子里都铺着枕头和毛绒绒的毯子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, "Don panic, now, don" panic!" while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class -- Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead -- had fled into Hagrid's cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果，他们发现炸尾螺并不冬眠，而且不喜欢被人塞进铺着枕头的箱子，盖上盖子。很快，海格便喊叫起来：“别紧张，别紧张！”因为炸尾螺在南瓜里横冲直撞，地里已经撒满了冒着青烟的箱子碎片。大多数同学——马尔福、克拉布和高尔打头——已经从后门逃进了海格的小屋，把自己关在里面。哈利、罗恩、赫敏则和其他一些同学一起留在外面帮助海格。他们齐心协力，总算制服了九条炸尾螺，把它们捆了起来，但他们也付出了惨重的代价，身上被烧伤和划伤了无数处。最后，只剩下一条炸尾螺了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利·波特…多比有时候可以来看你吗，先生？”多比试探地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know," said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. "Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it'll dawn on them that they want that too!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为，对于那些家养小精灵来说，这是一件最理想的事，”赫敏领头往大理石楼梯上走，一边说道，“我指的是多比来这里工作。别的小精灵会看到他获得自由是多么愉快，慢慢他们就会明白自己也愿意那样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'Course you can," said Harry, and Dobby beamed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然可以。”哈利说，多比顿时眉开眼笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know what?" said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. "All these years I've been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens -- well, it's not exactly difficult, is it? They can't wait to give it away!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们知道吗？”罗恩说道——这时他和赫敏、哈利刚离开厨房，正往通向门厅的楼梯上走，“这些年来，我一直觉得弗雷德和乔治很了不起，能从厨房里偷出吃的东西——闹了半天，实际上并不困难，是吗？小精灵们那么热情地把东西塞给你！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh she'll cheer up," said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. "Once the shock's worn off, and she's got used to Hogwarts, she'll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，她会高兴起来的。”赫敏说，不过她的口气也有些犹疑，“等这场惊吓过去，她习惯了霍格沃茨的生活时，就会看到她离开了那个叫克劳奇的家伙，日子要好过得多！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's hope they don't look too closely at Winky," said Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但愿他们不要太仔细地观察闪闪。”哈利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Probably says he's not a very good Head of Department," said Hermione, "and let's face it… he's got a point, hasn't he?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大概说他不是一个很称职的司长，”赫敏说，“说句实话…他这么说是有道理的，是不是？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She seems to love him," said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她似乎很爱那个男人。”罗恩含糊不清地说（他刚咬了一口奶油蛋糕）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't let Percy hear you saying that," Hermione said, smiling slightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可别让珀西听见你这么说。”赫敏说，淡淡地笑了笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Doesn't think much of Bagman, though, does she?" said Harry. "Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，她对巴格曼的评价可不高，是吗？”哈利说，“不知道克劳奇在家里是怎么议论巴格曼的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'd still rather work for him than old Crouch," said Ron. "At least Bagman's got a sense of humor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“跟克劳奇那老家伙比起来，我还是情愿在他手下工作，”罗恩说，“至少巴格曼还有点儿幽默感。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, well, Percy wouldn't want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he?" said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. "Percy wouldn't recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，说到珀西，他可不愿在任何一个有幽默感的人手下工作，是不是？”罗恩说——他现在又开始吃一块巧克力松饼了，“一个笑话哪怕只穿着多比的茶壶保暖套，几乎是光着身子在他面前跳舞，他也认不出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
