<div class="line_en">Having been through prep with Flavius, Venia, and Octavia numerous times, it should just be an old routine to survive. But I haven't anticipated the emotional ordeal that awaits me. At some point during the prep, each of them bursts into tears at least twice, and Octavia pretty much keeps up a running whimper throughout the morning. It turns out they really have become attached to me, and the idea of my returning to the arena has undone them. Combine that with the fact that by losing me they'll be losing their ticket to all kinds of big social events, particularly my wedding, and the whole thing becomes unbearable. The idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads, I find myself in the position of having to console them. Since I'm the person going in to be slaughtered, this is somewhat annoying.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's interesting, though, when I think of what Peeta said about the attendant on the train being unhappy about the victors having to fight again. About people in the Capitol not liking it. I still think all of that will be forgotten once the gong sounds, but it's something of a revelation that those in the Capitol feel anything at all about us. They certainly don't have a problem watching children murdered every year. But maybe they know too much about the victors, especially the ones who've been celebrities for ages, to forget we're human beings. It's more like watching your own friends die. More like the Games are for those of us in the districts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想起皮塔在火车上曾对我说过，那个侍者不愿看到胜利者再回到竞技场，凯匹特人也一样不愿意，可我认为只要一听到锣声，所有人就会把这一切忘掉。但有趣的是，凯匹特人确实在乎我们，这是一个新发现。当然，每年观看儿童互相厮杀，他们决没有问题，但兴许他们对那些胜利者太熟悉了，特别是那些多年前就已出名的人，观看这场比赛，就跟观看自己的老朋友故去一样。那么，这场比赛不如说是给辖区的老百姓看的吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

Standing there in my thin robe with my stinging skin and heart, I know I can't bear even one more look of regret. So the moment he walks in the door I snap, "I swear if you cry, I'll kill you here and now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直不停地在安慰他们，西纳到来时，我已经极度疲乏和恼怒，他们的眼泪使我想起家人，她们也一定在为我伤心流泪。我穿着薄薄的长袍站在那里，皮肤刺痛，心情难过，我知道自己再也不愿看到别人脸上表露出哪咱只是一点点遗憾的表情。所以他一进门，我就大声说道：“要是你哭，我发誓，我马上杀了你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So, what are we wearing for the opening ceremonies?" I finally ask as I scrape the second pot clean. "Headlamps or fire?" I know the chariot ride will require Peeta and me to be dressed in something coal related.</div>

<div class="line_en">When it's time to get in costume for the opening ceremonies, my prep team shows up but Cinna sends them away, saying they've done such a spectacular job in the morning, there's nothing left to do. They go off to recover, thankfully leaving me in Cinna's hands. He puts up my hair first, in the braided style my mother introduced him to, then proceeds with my makeup. Last year he used little so that the audience would recognize me when I landed in the arena. But now my face is almost obscured by the dramatic highlights and dark shadows. High arching eyebrows, sharp cheekbones, smoldering eyes, deep purple lips. The costume looks deceptively simple at first, just a fitted black jumpsuit that covers me from the neck down. He places a half crown like the one I received as victor on my head, but it's made of a heavy black metal, not gold. Then he adjusts the light in the room to mimic twilight and presses a button just inside the fabric on my wrist. I look down, fascinated, as my ensemble slowly comes to life, first with a soft golden light but gradually transforming to the orange-red of burning coal. I look as if I have been coated in glowing embers -- no, that I am a glowing ember straight from our fireplace. The colors rise and fall, shift and blend, in exactly the way the coals do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开幕式开始前我要作最后的准备，这时我的化妆师们又出现了，西纳夸赞他们上午的工作干得很棒，现在已经没什么事了，借此把他们支开了。他们到一旁去稳定情绪，谢天谢地，现在只留下了我和西纳。他先把我的辫子编起来，样子跟妈妈以前编的一样，然后给我化妆，去年的淡妆使我进人场地时观众能一眼就认出我。可这次，我的脸被深浅不一的颊彩涂得几乎看不出模样。眉毛画成高挑的弧形、颧骨用颊彩突显出来、眼部用烟熏妆、嘴上涂深紫色唇膏。服装看上去也很简单：就是一件从脖子到脚腕的紧身黑色套头装。之后，他给我戴上类似去年得胜时所戴的王冠，材质是深黑色金属而非黄色金属。他调整室内光线，使之类似黎明，然后他按动了隐藏在我袖口里的一个按钮。我低头一看，真是太奇妙了，我全身的衣服渐渐亮起来，闪动着缤纷的色彩，先是柔和的金黄色，逐渐变成橘红色，我看上去像是被炭火包裹了起来，啊，不，我就是一块壁炉里燃烧的炭火。色彩忽明忽暗，跳动闪烁，跟煤炭燃烧时发出的光亮一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He turns me toward a mirror so that I can take in the entire effect. I do not see a girl, or even a woman, but some unearthly being who looks like she might make her home in the volcano that destroyed so many in Haymitch's Quell. The black crown, which now appears red-hot, casts strange shadows on my dramatically made-up face. Katniss, the girl on fire, has left behind her flickering flames and bejeweled gowns and soft candlelight frocks. She is as deadly as fire itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把我转向一面镜子，好看到整体效果。我在镜子里看到的，不是一个女孩或一个女人，而是一个居住在火山里的神秘精灵，那火山就是黑密斯的世纪极限赛中出现的摧毁一切的火山。黑色的王冠此时呈现出红色，似在燃烧，在我涂彩妆的脸上映出奇幻的影像。凯特尼斯，燃烧的女孩，她已经抛弃了熠熠跳动的火焰、珠光闪闪的长袍、烛光般柔和的上衣。她是一团火，一团正在熊熊燃烧的致命的火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我想你涂粉色口红、扎丝带的时光已经过去了。”西纳说。他又按了一下我手腕上的按钮，把灯光熄灭。“别把电用光了。这次你在彩车上不要挥手，也不要微笑。我要你直视前方，好像所有的观众都已远离你的视线。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cinna has a few more things to attend to, so I decide to head down to the ground floor of the Remake Center, which houses the huge gathering place for the tributes and their chariots before the opening ceremonies. I'm hoping to find Peeta and Haymitch, but they haven't arrived yet. Unlike last year, when all the tributes were practically glued to their chariots, the scene is very social. The victors, both this year's tributes and their mentors, are standing around in small groups, talking. Of course, they all know one another and I don't know anyone, and I'm not really the sort of person to go around introducing myself. So I just stroke the neck of one of my horses and try not to be noticed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西纳还有事，所以我决定先到一楼的预备中心，所有的“贡品”和彩车都在那里集合，等待开幕式开始。我在人群中搜索着皮塔和黑密斯，可他们还没来。去年，所有的贡品都安排在彩车旁等候，可今年不同，大家可以进行交流。那些胜利者，不管是今年的“贡品”或指导老师，三三两两地围成一圈，在谈论着什么。当然，他们之间都认识，可我却不认识他们，而我也不是那种愿意到处走走，进行自我介绍的人。因而我只是抚弄着我的马脖子，尽量不引人注目。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finnick Odair is something of a living legend in Panem. Since he won the Sixty-fifth Hunger Games when he was only fourteen, he's still one of the youngest victors. Being from District 4, he was a Career, so the odds were already in his favor, but what no trainer could claim to have given him was his extraordinary beauty. Tall, athletic, with golden skin and bronze-colored hair and those incredible eyes. While other tributes that year were hard-pressed to get a handful of grain or some matches for a gift, Finnick never wanted for anything, not food or medicine or weapons. It took about a week for his competitors to realize that he was the one to kill, but it was too late. He was already a good fighter with the spears and knives he had found in the Cornucopia. When he received a silver parachute with a trident -- which may be the most expensive gift I've ever seen given in the arena -- it was all over. District 4's industry is fishing. He'd been on boats his whole life. The trident was a natural, deadly extension of his arm. He wove a net out of some kind of vine he found, used it to entangle his opponents so he could spear them with the trident, and within a matter of days the crown was his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬尼克·奥迪尔可是帕纳姆国的传奇人物。他十四岁时赢得第六十五届饥饿游戏桂冠，现在算来，他仍是最年轻的胜出者之一。他是来自四区的职业选手，因而他获胜的几率就比较大。但无论如何训练者都无法给予的是他英俊的容貌，他高大而健壮，长着棕色皮肤和深棕色的头发，最值得夸耀的是那双漂亮的眼睛，那年，当其他选手为了得到一些谷物或者火柴而拼命争抢时，他却什么都不需要，不需要食物，不需要药品或者武器。他的竞争对手在一周后才意识到他是真正的杀手，可是已经太晚了，他已经能够熟练使用在宙斯之角得到的长矛和刀子，成为一个厉害的杀手。当他收到银色降落伞送来的三叉戟时，那是我见过的送到竞技场里最贵重的礼物，比赛已接近尾声。四区以渔业为主，许多年来他都在船上过活，三叉戟是他们常使用的工具，也成为他的武器。他用自己找到的藤条织成网，把对手缠住，再用三叉戟杀死他们，只用了几天时间，胜利的桂冠就已到了他的手里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because of his youth, they couldn't really touch him for the first year or two. But ever since he turned sixteen, he's spent his time at the Games being dogged by those desperately in love with him. No one retains his favor for long.

Convinced he was trying to kill me. Now everything is reversed. I'm determined to keep him alive, knowing the cost will be my own life, but the part of me that is not so brave as I could wish is glad that it's Peeta, not Haymitch, beside me. Our hands find each other without further discussion. Of course we will go into this as one.</div>

I can't help catching glimpses of us on the huge screens along the route, and we are not just beautiful, we are dark and powerful. No, more. We star-crossed lovers from District 12, who suffered so much and enjoyed so little the rewards of our victory, do not seek the fans' favor, grace them with our smiles, or catch their kisses.
