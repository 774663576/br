<div class="line_en">"Auggie, like whimpering!" she answered impatiently. "She just started moaning, like something was really hurting her. And she was panting like crazy. Then she just kind of plopped down, and Mom went over and tried to pick her up, and whatever, she was obviously hurting. She bit Mom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奥吉，像呜咽！”她很不耐烦地回答，“她开始只是呻吟，好像什么东西弄疼了她。她还发疯般地喘气。然后一屁股跌倒在地，妈妈走过去试图抱她起来，不过，她显然疼得厉害。她咬了妈妈。”">查看中文翻译</div>

For some reason, Via and I had taken all of Daisy's toys from around the house and had put them in a little pile on the coffee table. Now we just stared at the pile.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mom and Dad came home two hours later. We knew the second they opened the door and Daisy wasn't with them that Daisy was gone. We all sat down in the living room around the pile of Daisy's toys. Dad told us what happened at the animal hospital, how the vet took Daisy for some X-rays and blood tests, then came back and told them she had a huge mass in her stomach. She was having trouble breathing. Mom and Dad didn't want her to suffer, so Daddy picked her up in his arms like he always liked to do, with her legs straight up in the air, and he and Mom kissed her goodbye over and over again and whispered to her while the vet put a needle into her leg. And then after about a minute she died in Daddy's arms. It was so peaceful, Daddy said. She wasn't in any pain at all. Like she was just going to sleep. A couple of times while he talked, Dad's voice got trembly and he cleared his throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两小时后，妈妈和爸爸回家了。他们开门的一瞬间我们就明白了，黛西没有跟他们回家，她已经死了。我们在客厅围着黛西的一堆玩具坐下来。爸爸跟我们讲了在动物医院的经过，兽医怎么给黛西照X光，检验血液，告诉他们她的胃部长了个巨大的肿瘤。她的呼吸很困难。妈妈和爸爸不希望她受罪，于是爸爸就像平常喜欢做的一样把她抱到怀里，让她的腿悬在空中，在兽医给她的大腿注射的时候，他和妈妈一遍又一遍地跟她吻别，跟她说悄悄话。大概一分钟后，她死在爸爸的怀里。她死得很安详，爸爸说。就像睡着了一样。爸爸的声音颤抖着重复了好几次，然后清了清嗓子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So I went to my bed and put on my pajamas without anyone telling me to and put the night-light on and turned the light off and crawled into the little mountain of stuffed animals I had left on my bed earlier. It felt like that all had happened a million years ago. I took my hearing aids off and put them on the night table and pulled the covers up to my ears and imagined Daisy snuggling with me, her big wet tongue licking my face all over like it was her favorite face in the world. And that's how I fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，不需要任何人吩咐，我换了睡衣，打开夜灯，关了大灯，然后上床，钻进我早前留在床上的毛绒玩具小山丘里。所有的一切仿佛发生在一百万年前。我摘下助听器，把它放在床头柜上，然后把被子拉到齐耳处，我想象黛西正依偎在我身上，她用潮湿的大舌头舔我的脸，好像这是世界上她最喜欢的一张脸。我就这样睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I've never seen Dad cry before, but I saw him cry tonight. I had gone into Mom and Dad's bedroom looking for Mom to put me to bed, but saw Dad sitting on the edge of the bed, taking off his socks. His back was to the door, so he didn't know I was there. At first I thought he was laughing because his shoulders were shaking, but then he put his palms on his eyes and I realized he was crying. It was the quietest crying I've ever heard. Like a whisper. I was going to go over to him, but then I thought maybe he was whisper-crying because he didn't want me or anyone else to hear him. So I walked out and went to Via's room, and I saw Mom lying next to Via on the bed, and Mom was whispering to Via, who was crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我以前从来没看见过爸爸哭，但是今天晚上见到了。我去妈妈和爸爸的卧室找妈妈陪我睡，结果看到爸爸坐在床沿正在脱袜子。他背对着门，并不知道我站在门口。一开始我还以为他在笑，因为他的肩膀在发抖，但是接着他用手蒙住了眼睛，我这才意识到他在哭。这是我听到过的最轻的哭泣。像是在轻言细语。我本来想走到他身边去，但是转念一想，他哭得那么小声也许是因为他不想让我或者别人听到。于是我离开，转身去了维娅的房间，我看见妈妈和维娅并肩躺在床上，维娅在哭泣，妈妈在轻声安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
