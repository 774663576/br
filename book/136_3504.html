<div class="line_en">The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. There was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had given him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to wash with. They had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. They had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures.</div>

<div class="line_en">Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. He was getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. The food was surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. Once there was even a packet of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him a light. The first time he tried to smoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out for a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when he was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make no difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. He dreamed a great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. He was in the Golden Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O'Brien -- not doing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. He seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had been removed. He was not bored, he had no desire for conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satisfying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们给了他一块白石板，角上还系了一截铅笔头。起先并没有派什么用场。即使他醒着，也全身无力，精神涣散。他经常从一次吃饭时间躺到下次吃饭时间，一动不动，有时睡着了，有时醒着漫无头绪地遐想，根本不想睁开眼睛。他已经习惯在强烈的光线下睡觉。这似乎没有什么不便，除了做的梦更连贯。这些日子里，他做了很多的梦，都是些快乐的梦。他身处黄金乡，或者坐在巨大的、灿烂阳光下的废墟中，和他的母亲、朱丽亚、奥布莱恩——没做什么事，只是坐在阳光下，恬然地说着话。他醒时产生的想法也大多和梦境有关。他似乎丧失了智力活动的能力，因为痛苦的刺激消除了。他不是厌倦，而是不想说话或做什么事。只想一个人待着，没有殴打或讯问，有足够吃的，到处干干净净，这就让人很满足了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began exercising himself regularly. In a little while he could walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre. But after a few more days -- a few more mealtimes -- even that feat was accomplished. A time came when he could do it six times running. He began to grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal. Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now, he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. From the moment when he was inside the Ministry of Love -- and yes, even during those minutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do -- he had grasped the frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the Party. He knew now that for seven years the Thought Police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, no word spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had not been able to infer. Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced. They had played sound-tracks to him, shown him photographs. Some of them were photographs of Julia and himself. Yes, even…He could not fight against the Party any longer. Besides, the Party was in the right. It must be so; how could the immortal, collective brain be mistaken? By what external standard could you check its judgements? Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question of learning to think as they thought. Only --!</div>

<div class="line_en">Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. "If I wished," O'Brien had said, "I could float off this floor like a soap bubble." Winston worked it out. "If he THINKS he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously THINK I see him do it, then the thing happens." Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: "It doesn't really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination." He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a "real" world where "real" things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.</div>

<div class="line_en">All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would shoot him. "Everything depends on yourself," O'Brien had said; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. It might be ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him for years in solitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might release him for a while, as they sometimes did. It was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again. The one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment. The tradition -- the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said -- was that they shot you from behind; always in the back of the head, without warning, as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的一部分心思也始终围绕这个问题，他们是否会很快枪毙他。“一切取决于你自己，”奥布莱恩说过；但他知道，任何有意识的行为都不会促使结局早日到来。可能十分钟后就会发生，也可能要等上十年。他们可能将他单独禁闭许多年，可能将他送往劳改营，也可能释放他一阵子，他们有时是这样做的。也很有可能在他被枪毙之前，逮捕和审讯的整个过程再从头来过。有件事可以肯定，死亡从不在期待的时刻来到。传统是——说不出口的传统，你多半知道，虽然从未听人说起——你走在囚室之间的走廊上，他们从背后朝你开枪，总是打后脑勺，事先不警告。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with propositions -- "the Party says the earth is flat", "the party says that ice is heavier than water" -- and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as "two and two make five" were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.</div>

There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more pain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily, with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he was in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face.

It was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. In any case, mere control of the features was not enough.

The enormous face (because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord. What were his true feelings towards Big Brother?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他闭上眼睛。这比理智上接受惩戒难多了。这是一个自我贬低、自我伤害的问题。他跌入最污秽的深坑。在所有令人厌恶的事情中，什么是最可怕的呢？他想到了老大哥。那张大脸（因为在宣传画上一再看到，他总以为那张脸有一米宽），浓密的黑胡子，以及始终跟随你的那双眼睛，似乎自动地浮现在他的脑海中。他对老大哥有什么样的真实感情呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
