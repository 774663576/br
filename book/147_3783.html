<div class="line_en">My Brother Ben's face, thought Eugene, is like a piece of slightly yellow ivory; his high white head is knotted fiercely by his old man's scowl; his mouth is like a knife, his smile the flicker of light across a blade. His face is like a blade, and a knife, and a flicker of light: it is delicate and fierce, and scowls beautifully forever, and when he fastens his hard white fingers and his scowling eyes upon a thing he wants to fix, he sniffs with sharp and private concentration through his long pointed nose. Thus women, looking, feel a well of tenderness for his pointed, bumpy, always scowling face: his hair shines like that of a young boy -- it is crinkled and crisp as lettuce.</div>

<div class="line_en">The plum-tree, black and brittle, rocks stiffly in winter wind. Her million little twigs are frozen in spears of ice. But in the Spring, lithe and heavy, she will bend under her great load of fruit and blossoms. She will grow young again. Red plums will ripen, will be shaken desperately upon the tiny stems. They will fall bursted on the loamy warm wet earth; when the wind blows in the orchard the air will be filled with dropping plums; the night will be filled with the sound of their dropping, and a great tree of birds will sing, burgeoning, blossoming richly, filling the air also with warm-throated plum-dropping bird-notes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="李树的枝干黑而发脆，在冬天日的冷风里僵硬地摇晃着，万千细小的树枝上都结了冰，变成了一个个小小的矛尖。但是春天一到，她又会开满鲜花、挂满果实，沉重地弯下了她的躯干，那时候她又会生机无限。鲜红的李子在细小的茎干上拼命地摇晃着，它们即将成熟，然后跌落在湿而肥沃的土地上；微风吹过果园的时候，天空中便会飘来小小的李子；黑夜里只听见它们轻声坠地的声音，一棵落满鸟儿的大树上传来阵阵高歌，万物都在萌发、开花，空气里充满了李子坠地、鸟儿欢歌的交响乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Into the April night-and-morning streets goes Ben. The night is brightly pricked with cool and tender stars. The orchard stirs leafily in the short fresh wind. Ben prowls softly out of the sleeping house. His thin bright face is dark within the orchard. There is a smell of nicotine and shoe leather under the young blossoms. His pigeon-toed tan shoes ring musically up the empty streets. Lazily slaps the water in the fountain on the Square; all the firemen are asleep -- but Big Bill Merrick, the brave cop, hog-jowled and red, leans swinishly over mince-pie and coffee in Uneeda Lunch. The warm good ink-smell beats in rich waves into the street: a whistling train howls off into the Springtime South.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本恩走在4月的黎明的街道上。清冷的夜空里亮起明明灭灭的星辰。微风吹过，果园的树叶发出哗哗的响声。本恩缓慢地走出酣睡的家，在果园里他那张瘦削苍白的脸显得模模糊糊，并不清晰。在刚刚盛开的果花下面，散发出尼古丁和皮鞋的气味。他的尖头皮鞋走在空荡荡的马路上，嗒嗒地发出空谷足音。广场的喷水池里水花懒洋洋地翻滚着；消防队员们还正在熟睡，伟大、勇敢的麦瑞克警官是个例外。此刻，肥头大耳、满面红光的他已经在安尼达餐馆的桌子埋头品尝甜馅饼，喝着浓咖啡了。大街上飘来一阵阵新鲜的油墨味儿；一列火车一路汽笛长鸣，吼叫着向春天的南国驶去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gant slept heavily, rattling the loose window-sash with deep rasping snores; with short explosive thunders, ripping the lilac night, 36 began to climb Saluda. She bucked helplessly like a goat, her wheels spun furiously on the rails, Tom Cline stared seriously down into the milky boiling creek, and waited. She slipped, spun, held, ploughed slowly up, like a straining mule, into the dark. Content, he leaned far out the cab and looked: the starlight glimmered faintly on the rails. He ate a thick sandwich of cold buttered fried meat, tearing it raggedly and glueily staining it under his big black fingers. There was a smell of dogwood and laurel in the cool slow passage of the world. The cars clanked humpily across the spur; the switchman, bathed murkily in the hot yellow light of his perilous bank-edged hut, stood sullen at the switch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘特睡得很沉，所以他低沉、起伏的鼾声把窗户震得哗哗直响。淡紫的夜色中突然爆出短促的轰隆声，36号班车开始在萨路达山坡上爬行。火车就像一只山羊正在无助地喘息着，它的车轮在钢轨上奋力直转。开车的汤姆·克莱恩凝神注视底下白瀑沸腾的山溪，静等着什么。车轮打滑了，开始转动、停一下，然后慢慢前行，就像一头负重的骡子行走在黑暗里。等一切恢复正常之后，他又探出身子，朝驾驶室外张望了一下，这时候星光在钢轨上闪烁着。他吃了厚厚一块冷煎牛肉三明治，上面涂了黄油。他粗鲁地用牙齿撕咬着，黑乎乎的大指头把面包捏得面目全非。一股山茱萸和月桂树的清凉香味从铁道那里传过来。车厢经过钢轨交叉的地方时，发出了咔嗒咔嗒的声音；扳道工人板着脸站在道岔旁边，从扳道房里隐隐透出一丝昏黄的灯光，他的身影隐约映在这丝灯光里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Strangely, in sharp broken fragments, life awoke in the lilac darkness. Clop-clopping slowly on the ringing street, Number Six, Mrs. Goulderbilt's powerful brown mare, drew inevitably on the bottle-clinking cream-yellow wagon, racked to the top with creamy extra-heavy high-priced milk. The driver was a fresh-skinned young countryman, richly odorous with the smell of fresh sweat and milk. Eight miles, through the starlit dewy fields and forests of Biltburn, under the high brick English lodgegate, they had come into the town.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the Pisgah Hotel, opposite the station, the last door clicked softly; the stealthy footfalls of the night ceased; Miss Bernice Redmond gave the negro porter eight one-dollar bills and went definitely to bed with the request that she be not disturbed until one o'clock; a shifting engine slatted noisily about in the yard; past the Biltburn crossing Tom Cline whistled with even, mournful respirations. By this time Number 3 had delivered 142 of his papers; he had only to ascend the rickety wooden stairs of the Eagle Crescent bank to finish the eight houses of the Crescent. He looked anxiously across the hill-and-dale-sprawled negro settlement to the eastern rim: behind Birdseye Gap the sky was pearl-gray -- the stars looked drowned. Not much time left, he thought. He had a blond meaty face, pale-colored and covered thickly with young blond hair. His jaw was long and fleshy: it sloped backward. He ran his tongue along his full cracked underlip.</div>

<div class="line_en">A 1910 model, four-cylinder, seven-passenger Hudson, with mounting steady roar, shot drunkenly out from the station curbing, lurched into the level negro-sleeping stretch of South End Avenue, where the firemen had their tournaments, and zipped townward doing almost fifty. The station quietly stirred in its sleep: there were faint reverberating noises under the empty sheds; brisk hammer-taps upon car wheels, metallic heel-clicks in the tiled waiting-room. Sleepily a negress slopped water on the tiles, with languid sullen movement pushing a gray sopping rag around the floor.</div>

The black glasses gave the suggestion that he was half-masked; they added a touch of unsearchable mystery to the subtle, sensual and disquieting intelligence of his face. His negro man appeared at this moment and told him his bath was ready. He drew the long thin nightgown over his freckled Fitzsimmons body and stepped vigorously into tepid water.

Then, on her soft powerful tread, she went downstairs, and entered her study, where Sister Louise (French), Sister Mary (History), and Sister Bernice (Ancient Languages) were waiting for the morning consultation.

The fortunate youth who had been chosen then came forward and took the tray, still richly morselled with food and a pot half full of coffee. As he had to depart at this moment on a delivery, he put it down in the sawdust at the end of the bench and spat copiously upon it in order to protect it from his scavenging comrades.

Somewhere in the crowd a woman sobbed and collapsed in a faint. She was immediately carried out by two Boy Scouts who happened to be present, and who administered first aid to her in the rest-room, one of them hastily kindling a crackling fire of pine boughs by striking two flints together, while the other made a tourniquet, and tied several knots in his handkerchief. Then pandemonium broke loose. Women tore the jewels from their fingers, ropes of pearls from their necks, chrysanthemums, hyacinths, tulips and daisies from their expensive corsages, while the fashionably-dressed men in the near-by stalls kept up a constant bombardment of tomatoes, lettuces, new potatoes, beef-tallow, pigs' knuckles, fishheads, clams, loin-chops, and pork-sausages.</div>
