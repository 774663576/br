<div class="line_en">When Albert was alone with Monte Cristo, he said: "Monsieur le Comte, let me embark on my duties as your guide by showing you this example of a bachelor apartment. Accustomed as you are to Italian palaces, it will be interesting for you to estimate in how few square feet a young man can live in Paris without being counted among those who are the most poorly housed. As we pass from one room to the next, we shall open the windows to allow you to breathe."</div>

<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo already knew the dining-room and the downstairs drawing-room. Firstly, Albert conducted him to his attic; this, you will remember, was his favourite room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼下的餐室和客厅基督山已经看过了。阿尔培先领他到他的艺术工作室里，那间工作室，我们已经说过，原是他最心爱的房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo was well able to appreciate all the things that Albert had amassed in the room: old chests, Japanese porcelain, oriental cloths, jewels of Venetian glass and weapons from every country in the world: he was familiar with all these things and needed only a glance to recognize century, country and provenance. Morcerf imagined that he would do the explaining, but on the contrary, under the count's guidance, he found himself taking lessons in archaeology, mineralogy and natural history. They came back down to the first floor and Albert showed his guest into the drawing-room. The walls here were hung with modern paintings: there were landscapes by Dupré, with long reeds, slender trees, lowing cows and wonderful skies; there were Arab riders by Delacroix, dressed in flowing white burnous, with shining belts and damascened weapons, whose horses were biting their own flanks in fury while the riders rent one another with iron maces; there were watercolours by Boulanger illustrating the whole of Notre-Dame de Paris with the energy that makes the painter the equal of the poet; there were canvases by Diaz, who makes flowers more lovely than flowers and a sun brighter than the sun; drawings by Decamps, as highly coloured as those of Salvator Rosa, but more poetic; pastels by Giraud and Müller depicting children with angel faces and women with virginal features; pages torn from Dauzat's sketchbook of his journeys to the East, drawn in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosque; in short, everything that modern art can offer in exchange and compensation for the art lost and vanished with earlier centuries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督山是一位可敬的鉴赏家，凡是阿尔培搜罗在这儿的一切东西：古老的木柜，日本瓷器，东方织物，威尼斯玻璃器具，世界各地的武器——每一样东西他都熟悉，一看就认得它们是哪一个时代的东西，产于哪一个国家和它们的来历。马瑟夫原以为应该由他来指导伯爵的，实际上恰巧相反，倒是他在伯爵的指导之下上了一课考古学，矿物学和博物学。他们下到二楼，阿尔培领他的贵宾进入客厅。客厅里挂满了近代画家的作品，有杜伯勒画的风景：长长的芦苇和高大的树木，嘶叫的牛和绮丽的天空；有德拉克络画的阿伯拉豪侠：白色的长袍，闪闪发光的腰带，戴着铁套的手臂，马用牙齿互相嘶咬，而马上的骑者则用他们的长槌凶猛地格斗；有希郎杰的水彩画，色彩极其动人，以致使画家成了诗人的仇敌；有地亚士的油画，他使他的花比花更美丽，使他的太阳比太阳更灿烂；有德康的图案画，色彩象萨尔瓦德·罗撒的画一样生动，但却更富于诗意；有吉罗和穆勒的粉笔画，把小孩子画得象安琪儿，把女人画得象仙女般美貌；有从杜柴的东土旅行写生簿上撕下来的速写，那些速写都是在一只骆驼的鞍上或一座回教寺院的殿堂下只花几秒钟的时间勾成的——总之，都是近代的艺术珍品，能补偿那些久已失传的古代艺术品的杰作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From the drawing-room they went into the bedroom. This was at the same time a model of elegance and austere in its taste. Only one portrait here, but by Léopold Robert, magnificent in its burnished gold frame. The portrait at once attracted the Count of Monte Cristo's attention, because he took three rapid paces across the room and stopped in front of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从客厅走进寝室，这个房间布置得极其朴素雅致。在一只镀金镂花的镜框里，嵌着一幅署名“李奥波·罗勃脱”的人像画。这幅人像画吸引了基督山伯爵的注意，因为他在房间里急行三步，然后突然在画像前面停下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here, at least, Albert expected to show the stranger something new but, to his great astonishment, the count, without even having to look for the signature (some of those in any case only took the form of initials), instantly put the name of each artist on his work, so that it was easy to see that not only was each of these names already known to him, but that he had also studied and judged each of these talented artists.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔培以为这一次可以有些新的东西给那位旅行家看看了，但使他极其惊奇的是：后者不必寻觅画上的签名（其中有许多实际上也只有缩写），就能立刻说出每一幅的作者姓名，而且态度非常安闲自在，可以看出他不只知道每一个画家的姓名，而且还曾鉴别和研究过他们的风格。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It showed a young woman of twenty-five or twenty-six, dark in colouring, her burning eyes veiled beneath languorous lids. She was wearing the picturesque costume of a Catalan fisherwoman, with a red-and-black bodice and her hair held back with gold pins. She was looking at the sea, so that her elegant figure was outlined against the two blues, of the sky and the waves.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a moment's silence, in which Monte Cristo remained with his eyes unwaveringly fixed on the painting. "You have a beautiful mistress there, Vicomte," he said, in a perfectly calm voice. "And this costume, no doubt intended for the ball, suits her astonishingly well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您有一位最最漂亮的爱人，子爵，”伯爵用一种十分平静的口吻说，“而这套服装——无疑的是一套舞服——使她可爱极了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Had it not been dark in the room, Albert would have observed the livid pallor that spread across the count's cheeks and noticed the nervous tremor that shook his shoulders and his chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里的光线是这样的微弱，所以阿尔培并没有觉察到伯爵的脸色突然苍白，他的胸部和肩膀在神经质的颤抖。房间里暂时沉寂了一会儿，在这期间，基督山出神地凝视着那幅画。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, Monsieur!" Albert said. "I should not forgive you this mistake, if you had seen any other portrait beside this one. You do not know my mother, Monsieur. She is the person in that picture, which she had done six or eight years ago, dressed like this in some imaginary costume, apparently; the resemblance is so good that I feel I can still see my mother as she was in 1830. The countess had the portrait done for herself while the count was away. No doubt she intended to give him a pleasant surprise when he returned, but, oddly enough, the portrait displeased my father and the value of the canvas which, as you can see, is one of Léopold Robert's excellent works, could not overcome the dislike he had conceived for it. Between ourselves, my dear Count, it is true to say that Monsieur de Morcerf is one of the most conscientious peers in the Upper Chamber and a general renowned for his theories, but a very poor connoisseur of art. The same is not true of my mother, who paints remarkably well and has too much respect for such a work to relinquish it altogether and who gave it to me so that in my house it would be less liable to upset Monsieur de Morcerf. I shall shortly show you his portrait, painted by Gros. Forgive me if I seem to chatter on about domestic matters and my family, but as I shall later have the honour of introducing you to the count I am telling you this so that you will know not to praise this portrait in front of him. In any case, it has an unhappy aura. My mother very seldom comes to my house without looking at it and still less often does she look at it without weeping. The cloud that entered our household with the appearance in it of this painting is the only one that has ever fallen across the count and countess who, though they have been married for more than twenty years, are still as closely united as on the very first day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，阁下！”阿尔培答道，“要是您看过在这幅画旁边的另一幅画，我就不能原谅您这个错误了。您不认识家母。您在这幅画上看到的人就是她。这幅像是在七八年以前画的。这套服装，看来，是幻想出来的，可是画得这样毕真毕肖，使我觉得好象看到了一八三〇年时候的家母一样。伯爵夫人这幅像是在伯爵出门的时候画的。她无疑是想使他吃一惊，但说来奇怪，家父似乎很不高兴这幅像，即使这幅画十分名贵——您已经看到，这是李奥波·罗勃脱的杰作之一——但也不能克服他对它的厌恶。真的，这话可只是我们自己说说的，马瑟夫先生是卢森堡最勤勉的贵族之一，是一位以军事理论闻名的将军，但对于艺术却是一个最庸俗的外行。家母就不同了，她本人就画得极好，她为了不愿意舍弃这样名贵的一幅画，所以送给我挂在这儿，这样可以减少一些马瑟夫先生的不愉快。马瑟夫先生的像是格洛斯画的，喏，就是这一幅。请原谅我谈家事，但既然您赏脸让我把您介绍给伯爵，我就把这件事告诉您，免得您对这幅画有所误会。这幅画似乎有一种魔力，因为家母每次到这儿来，总要看看它，而每次一看它就非哭不可。伯爵和伯爵夫人之间一生惟有这一件事不和，他们虽然结婚已有二十多年，却还是象新婚那天一样的和睦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo bowed in reply. He accepted the proposal without enthusiasm or reluctance, as one of those social conventions with which every well-bred man must comply. Albert called his valet and told him to go and advise M. and Mme de Morcerf that the Count of Monte Cristo would shortly wait on them. Albert and the count followed him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now that you have seen all my riches, Monsieur le Comte," he continued, "allow me to offer them to you, unworthy though they are. Consider this your home here and, to put you still more at your ease, pray accompany me to Monsieur de Morcerf's. I wrote from Rome to tell him of the service you had done me and to announce that you had promised to visit me. I may tell you that the count and countess are impatient to thank you. I know, Monsieur le Comte, that you are a little blasé about everything, and that Sinbad the Sailor is little touched by scenes of family life: you have witnessed other so much more exciting ones! However, as your initiation to Parisian life, allow me to offer you the round of daily etiquette, visits and introductions."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Azur, seven merlets, or, placed bender. No doubt this is your family's coat of arms, Monsieur? Apart from the knowledge of the elements of the shield that permits me to decipher it, I am very ignorant in matters of heraldry, being myself an accidental count, fabricated by Tuscany with the help of a commandership of Saint Stephen: I should never have passed myself off as a great nobleman were it not that I was repeatedly told this was absolutely necessary for anyone who travels a lot. When it comes down to it, one must have something on the doors of one's coach to dissuade the Customs from searching it. So forgive me for asking."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“七只浅蓝色的燕子，”他说，“这无疑是您的家族纹章吧？我对于纹章虽有点研究，能略加辨识，但对于家谱学却十分无知——我是一个新封的伯爵，这个衔头是在托斯卡纳靠了圣爱蒂埃总督的帮忙胡乱得来的，要不是他们说这是旅行所必需的，我本来还不高兴来这一套麻烦。但是，一个人在出门的时候，马车的坐垫底下，总是有一些想避免海关关员搜索的东西的。原谅我向您提出这样的一个问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The question is not at all indiscreet, Monsieur," Morcerf replied in the frank tones of someone who believed what he said. "You are right: this is our coat of arms, that is to say it bears my father's crest, but attached to a shield that is gules with a silver tower, bearing my mother's crest. On her side I am Spanish, but the Morcerfs are French and, so I am told, one of the oldest families in the south of France."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这并没有什么失礼，”马瑟夫很相信地坦白地答道。“您猜对了。这是我们的纹章——那是说，是家父这一族的，但您也看到，这旁边还有一面盾，上面有红色的直线和一座银色的堡砦，那是家母族中的。从她那一方面说，我是一个西班牙人，但马瑟夫这一族是法国人，而且我听说，是法国南部历史最悠久的家族之一呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On reaching the count's antechamber, the visitor could see a shield above the door leading to the reception room which, being extravagantly mounted and made to harmonize with the décor of the room, indicated the importance that the owner of the mansion attached to this coat of arms.

<div class="line_en">"That may be so," said Morcerf. "Somewhere in my father's study there is a family tree which will answer these questions for us; I used to have a commentary on it that would have meant a lot to d'Hozier and Jaucourt. Nowadays I don't bother about it, but I should tell you, Monsieur le Comte -- and this falls within my scope as your guide -- that people are starting to worry a great deal about such things under this popular government of ours."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可能是的，”马瑟夫说，“家父的书斋里有一本族谱，您一看就可以完全明白。我曾在那本族谱上作过批注，要是荷齐埃①和乔古②看了，对于他们的研究一定大有裨益。我现在已不再想那些事了，可是我必须告诉您，在我们这个平民的政府之下，我们对于这些事情又在开始大大地注意起来了。”【注：①荷齐埃（1592－1660），法国家谱学者。②乔古（1704－1779），法国学者。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Monte Cristo, "that is shown by the merlets or blackbirds. Almost all the crusaders who conquered, or tried to conquer, the Holy Land took either crosses as their emblems, as a sign of the mission to which they had dedicated themselves, or else migratory birds, as a symbol of the long journey that they intended to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith. One of your paternal ancestors must have taken part in the Crusades; and, if it was only the Crusade led by Saint Louis, that already takes us back to the thirteenth century, which is already a very fine thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”基督山答道，“这些纹章就可以证明，凡是武装去参朝圣地的人，几乎都在他的武器上画着一个十字架或几只候鸟，十字架表示他们光荣的使命，候鸟则象征他们快要出发作漫长的旅行，并希望凭着虔敬的翅膀来完成它。您的祖先曾有人参加过十字军，而即使只参加圣路易所领导的那一次，也已可上溯至十三世纪，那也算是历史相当悠久的了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well then, your government should have chosen something better from French history than those two placards I have noticed on your public monuments, which are meaningless in heraldic terms. As for you, Viscount," Monte Cristo continued, turning back towards Morcerf, "you are luckier than your government, because your coat of arms is truly beautiful and inspiring. Yes, that is it: you come both from Provence and from Spain and, if the portrait you showed me is a good likeness, that explains the fine tan that I so greatly admired on the face of the Catalan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，那末，你们的政府还是另外挑选一些旧事旧物来做徽章的好，象我刚才所注意到的那种纪念品，是和纹章毫无关系的。至于您，子爵，”基督山继续对马瑟夫说，“您比政府还更幸福，因为府上的纹章真是美丽极了，看了引人入胜。是的，您的父母是普罗旺斯和西班牙两地的贵族。这就说明了您给我看的那幅画像，我所这样钦慕的那种微黑的肤色，正是高贵的迦太兰人的特征。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the most prominent place on the walls of the room there was another portrait. It depicted a man of between thirty-five and thirty-eight years old, wearing a general's uniform with the twisted double epaulette that indicates the higher ranks and the ribbon of the Legion of Honour around his neck, showing that he was a Commander of the Order. On his chest, to the right, he wore the medal of a Grand Officer of the Order of the Saviour and, to the left, that of the Great Cross of Charles III, demonstrating that the person represented in the portrait must have fought in the Spanish and Greek Wars, or else (this being identical as far as medals were concerned) have carried out some diplomatic mission in those two countries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在客厅最引人触目的一面墙上，又有一幅画像。画上是一个男人，年龄在三十五到三十八岁之间，身穿一套将官的制服，佩着金银双重肩章，由此可以看出官级很高；他的脖子上挂着荣誉军团的缎带，表明他曾当过司令官；在胸部，右面挂着一枚武将优异勋章，左面挂的是一枚查理三世的大十字勋章，证明画上的这个人参加过希西战争，或曾在那两国完成过某项外交使命。所以才能得到这个勋章。【注：①斯芬克斯是希腊神话中的狮身女首怪，路人经过她的面前，她就要提出一个谜语：“一样东西，小时候用四只脚走路，长大了用两只脚走路，老了用三只脚走路，那是什么东西？”凡答不出的人都要被她吃掉。奥狄波斯原是一位王子，因不容于父王，出国流浪，路遇斯芬克斯，猜出了谜底是“人”。于是斯芬克斯大叫一声，化为一尊石像。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One would have needed to be Oedipus or the Sphinx itself to detect the irony that the count put into these words, which were apparently delivered with the finest good manners. Morcerf consequently thanked him with a smile and, going ahead to show him the way, opened the door beneath his coat of arms, which, as we mentioned, led into the reception room.</div>

His dark moustache and eyebrows contrasted oddly with almost white hair, cut short in the military manner. He was dressed in the everyday clothes of a man of his class; the different strands of the ribbon that he wore in his buttonhole recalled the various orders with which he had been decorated. He came in with quite an aristocratic step and, at the same time, a sort of condescending alacrity. Monte Cristo watched him approach without taking a step to meet him: it was as though his feet were fixed to the floor and his eyes on the Comte de Morcerf's face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is things such as these that maintain your people's superiority over others, Monsieur," Monte Cristo replied. "You, a nobleman of good family, heir to a large fortune, agreed first of all to make your way up from the ranks, which is very rare. Then, having become a general, a peer of the realm and a Commander of the Legion of Honour, you were willing to undertake a second apprenticeship, with no other expectation and no other reward than that of one day being useful to your fellow men. Monsieur! This is truly fine! I will go further: it is sublime!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贵国人民所以能优于任何其他各国就是因为有这种思想的缘故，”基督山回答。“象您这样家产富足，出身高贵的一位爵士，竟肯去当一名小兵，一步步地求升迁——这已经不平凡了，而在您身为将军，法国贵族，荣誉军团的司令官以后，又肯开始第二次的学徒生活，心中别无任何其他的希望而只求有一天可以有益于您的同胞——这实在是值得赞美的，不，简直是太崇高了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh!" Morcerf exclaimed, blushing slightly. "I have left the service, Monsieur. I was given my peerage under the Restoration and served under Maréchal de Bourmont. For that reason, I might have hoped for some higher command: who knows what would have happened if the senior branch of the royal family had remained on the throne! But it seems that the July Revolution was glorious enough to afford ingratitude: it behaved thus to all whose service did not date back to the empire. So I resigned because, when a man has won his epaulettes on the battlefield, he does not know how to manoeuvre on the slippery surface of a drawing-room. I put down my sword and devoted myself to politics, to industry; I studied the useful arts. I had wanted to do that during my twenty years' service to my country, but I did not have time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，”马瑟夫回答，面皮微微有点发红，“我已经退伍了，阁下。我曾在布蒙元帅的领导之下作战，在复辟以后被封为贵族。我本来有希望得到更高的爵位，但要还是拿破仑当政的话，谁又能料得后来的情形会怎么样呢？但七月革命的光荣似乎就在于它的忘恩负义，尤其是对那些在帝国时期以前就已为国效劳的军人忘恩负义。所以我提出辞职。一个人在战场上杀伐经年以后，一旦回到客厅里，简直连怎样在光滑的地板上走路都不会了。我挂起了我的剑，投身到政治里。我致力于实业，我研究各种有用的工艺。在我二十年的从军生活期间，我常常想这样做，但那时我没有时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I have seen so many strange things to do with him that, if you ask what I think, I would say that I am inclined to consider him as some kind of Byronic figure, branded by Fate's dread seal: some Manfred, some Lara, some Werner… In short, one of those rejects of an old aristocratic family, cut off from the paternal inheritance, who made a fortune for themselves by the force of a daring and a genius that put them above the laws of society…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is true, even so. Three or four times he said to me, assuredly without any premeditation: at that time I was five; at this other, I was ten; and at another, twelve.
