<div class="line_en">Though Kitty had met his wife at various tea-parties she had been some weeks in Hong Kong before she saw Charles Townsend. She was introduced to him only when with her husband she went to dine at his house. Kitty was on the defensive. Charles Townsend was Assistant Colonial Secretary and she had no mind to allow him to use her with the condescension which, notwithstanding her good manners, she discerned in Mrs. Townsend. The room in which they were received was spacious. It was furnished as was every other drawing-room she had been in at Hong Kong in a comfortable and homely style. It was a large party. They were the last to come and as they entered Chinese servants in uniform were handing round cocktails and olives. Mrs. Townsend greeted them in her casual fashion and looking at a list told Walter whom he was to take in to dinner.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not the first time that Walter's moderation had exasperated her. She asked herself why it was necessary to be so prudent: you either liked people or you didn't. She had liked Charles Townsend very much. And she had not expected to. He was probably the most popular man in the Colony. It was supposed that the Colonial Secretary would retire soon and everyone hoped that Townsend would succeed him. He played tennis and polo and golf. He kept racing ponies. He was always ready to do any one a good turn. He never let red tape interfere with him. He put on no airs. Kitty did not know why she had resented hearing him so well spoken of, she could not help thinking he must be very conceited: she had been extremely silly; that was the last thing you could accuse him of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦尔特的中庸态度不是第一次激怒她了。有什么理由必须这样出口审慎呢？你要么喜欢一个人，要么不喜欢。她非常喜欢查尔斯·唐生。这是她始料不及的。他几乎是这块殖民地上最受欢迎的人。据说香港布政司不久就将卸任，每个人都希望唐生来接任这个职位。他打网球、马球和高尔夫球，自己还养了一匹赛马。他的马可以轻松超过任何人，几乎从不会让冠军旁落。他从不装腔作势。凯蒂不知道为什么以前别人夸他时她都不以为然，她觉得他肯定是个狂妄自负的人。看来她是大错特错了。要是他还有什么叫她不痛快的，那就是她犯的这个错误了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had enjoyed her evening. They had talked of the theatres in London, and of Ascot and Cowes, all the things she knew about, so that really she might have met him at some nice house in Lennox Gardens; and later, when the men came into the drawing-room after dinner, he had strolled over and sat beside her again. Though he had not said anything very amusing, he had made her laugh; it must have been the way he said it: there was a caressing sound in his deep, rich voice, a delightful expression in his kind, shining blue eyes, which made you feel very much at home with him. Of course he had charm. That was what made him so pleasant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她好好地享受了这个晚上。他们谈论了伦敦的剧院，聊起了爱斯科赛马场和考斯，只要是她知道的，她都尽情地倾吐出来，就好像他们早就在莱那克斯花园某间豪华的客厅里认识过一样。晚饭后不久，绅士们陆续来到休息室，他踱了两步后又坐到她的旁边。他的话本身不是那么逗趣，但却老是把她逗乐，一定是他说话的方式太特别了。他的声音既深沉又热切，听了让人心安气定。他明亮温柔的蓝眼睛里流露着某种令人愉悦的东西，能让她从头到脚地放松下来。他确实魅力十足，这就是他处处受人欢迎的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was tall, six foot two at least, she thought, and he had a beautiful figure; he was evidently in very good condition and he had not a spare ounce of fat on him. He was well-dressed, the best- dressed man in the room, and he wore his clothes well. She liked a man to be smart. Her eyes wandered to Walter: he really should try to be a little better turned out. She noticed Townsend's cufflinks and waistcoat buttons; she had seen similar ones at Carrier's. Of course the Townsends had private means.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他个子很高，她觉得他至少有六英尺二英寸。他的身材相当健美，几乎身体每处地方都完美无缺，在他身上找不到一点多余的肥肉。他梳着优雅的发型，在房间里的男士中应该是最有品味的。他的穿着也非常讲究。她喜欢这样潇洒整洁的男人。她的眼睛看向了瓦尔特，他的形象真应该改善一下。她又注意到唐生袖口上的链扣和马甲上的纽扣，以前在卡地亚珠宝店也见过与之类似的。唐生家族显然家道殷实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could not but know that she had made an impression on him. If he had not said charming things to her his eyes, warm with admiration, would have betrayed him. His ease was delightful. He had no self-consciousness. Kitty was at home in these circumstances and she admired the way in which amid the banter which was the staple of their conversation he insinuated every now and then a pretty, flattering speech. When she shook hands with him on leaving he gave her hand a pressure that she could not mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她敢确信他被她迷住了。要是他嘴上没说什么，那双闪烁着欣赏之情的眼睛也背叛了他。他似乎兴奋得过了头，自己却还没意识到。这种场景凯蒂最熟悉不过了。他们一直向彼此说着笑话，但他时不时不露声色地夹杂上两句奉承话，讨得她十分欢心。到了分别握手的时候，他的手上用的劲儿，就更不会错了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She liked the little trim curly moustache which did not conceal his full red lips. He had black hair, short and brushed very sleek. But of course his eyes, under thick, bushy eyebrows, were his best feature: they were so very blue, and they had a laughing tenderness which persuaded you of the sweetness of his disposition. No man who had those blue eyes could bear to hurt any one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很喜欢他那撮卷曲的小胡子，它被打理得整整齐齐，一点也没有盖住他红润的嘴唇。他有一头乌黑的短发，梳得油光可鉴。不过要说最迷人的地方，还应该是浓眉之下的那双眼睛。它们蓝极了，眼底流露着和蔼之情，显示了他这个人的脾气有多好。看看这双蓝眼睛，它的主人怎么可能伤害到别人一点呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
