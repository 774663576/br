<div class="line_en">The sow had a sweeter temper than some horses he had ridden. Patient and sure-footed, she accepted Tyrion with hardly a squeal when he clambered onto her back, and remained motionless as he reached for shield and lance. Yet when he gathered up her reins and pressed his feet into her side, she moved at once. Her name was Pretty, short for Pretty Pig, and she had been trained to saddle and bridle since she was a piglet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这头母猪比他骑过的很多马都好脾气的多。耐心而步伐稳健，她几乎一声不响的让提利昂爬上了她的背，接着在他去拿盾牌和长矛的时候动也没动。而当他收起缰绳两腿一夹她的腹部时她立刻就懂了。她的名字叫美丽，是美丽猪的简称，而当她还是个小猪仔时就训以撞上马鞍和缰绳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The painted wooden armor clattered as Pretty trotted across the deck. Tyrion's armpits were prickly with perspiration, and a bead of sweat was trickling down his scar beneath the oversized, ill-fitting helm, yet for one absurd moment he felt almost like Jaime, riding out onto a tourney field with lance in hand, his golden armor flashing in the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当佩妮在甲板上开始小跑时，刷了漆的木质铠甲便咔哒作响。提利昂的腋窝浸满了汗水痒的难受，一行汗水流下他完全不合适的头盔覆盖着的疤痕，但荒谬的一瞬间他几乎感觉自己像詹姆一样，在比武比赛上一矛在手，金色的盔甲在阳光下闪闪发光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the laughter began, the dream dissolved. He was no champion, just a dwarf on a pig clutching a stick, capering for the amusement of some restless rum-soaked sailors in hopes of sweetening their mood. Somewhere down in hell his father was seething and Joffrey was chuckling. Tyrion could feel their cold dead eyes watching this mummer's face, as avid as the crew of the Selaesori Qhoran.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但当大家开始大笑时，这个美梦消失了。他不是什么赢家，只是个抓着根棍子的骑猪侏儒，为给一些焦躁不安的浸在朗姆酒里的水手一点好心情而做出愚蠢的娱乐。在某层地狱他的父亲神情激动而乔佛里则轻笑出声。提利昂可以感到他们的冰冷的死眼盯着这张戏子的脸，就像Selaesori Qhoran号上的水手们一样急切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion kicked at Pretty's haunches to speed her to a charge as the sailors urged him on with hoots and shouts. Whether they were shouting encouragement or mocking him he could not have said for certain, though he had a fair notion. Why did I ever allow myself to be talked into this farce?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂在水手们大呼小叫起哄时踢了一脚美丽猪的后腰让她加速发动一次进攻。他不能肯定他们是在鼓励他还是取笑他，但是他突然有了一种想法。我以前干嘛不允许自己被说服加入这种滑稽秀呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew the answer, though. For twelve days now the ship had floated becalmed in the Gulf of Grief. The mood of the crew was ugly, and like to turn uglier when their daily rum ration went dry. There were only so many hours a man could devote to mending sails, caulking leaks, and fishing. Jorah Mormont had heard the muttering about how dwarf luck had failed them. Whilst the ship's cook still gave Tyrion's head a rub from time to time, in hopes that it might stir a wind, the rest had taken to giving him venomous looks whenever he crossed their paths. Penny's lot was even worse, since the cook had put about the notion that squeezing a dwarf girl's breast might be just the thing to win their luck back. He had also started referring to Pretty Pig as Bacon, a jape that had seemed much funnier when Tyrion had made it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他其实是知道答案的。起航十二天来他们一直在悲伤湾平静的漂着。船员的心情恶劣，而当他们的朗姆酒储存告罄后有更加恶劣的危险。一个人能修补船帆、填补裂缝和打渔的时间实在有限。在船上的厨师依旧不时的揉搓提利昂的脑袋期望这会搅起一点风的时候，船上的其他人已经在他挡了路的时候对他投以恶毒的眼神。佩妮的运气就更差了，这一切始于厨师开始散布关于挤一个侏儒女孩的胸有助于找回好运的观念。他也开始称美丽猪为培根，这个玩笑似乎比提利昂当初提出时更可笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now here came his foe. Penny rode her big grey dog, her striped lance waving drunkenly as the beast bounded across the deck. Her shield and armor had been painted red, though the paint was chipped and fading; his own armor was blue. Not mine. Groat's. Never mine, I pray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他的敌人出现了。佩妮骑着她的大灰狗，她举着刷着条纹的长矛像甲板上弹跳着的野兽一样醉鬼般的挥舞。她的盾牌和盔甲漆称红色，但是已经上面的油漆已经开始碎裂起皮；他的盔甲是蓝色的。不是我的。格罗特的。希望以后也不是我的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Penny's lance descended just in time for its blunted point to brush his shoulder; his own lance wobbled as he brought it down and banged it noisily off a corner of her shield. She kept her seat. He lost his. But then, he was supposed to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩妮的长矛在它的钝头擦过他的肩膀时适时的掉了；而他的长矛在它撞上她的盾角发出巨响并猛颤。她还骑在狗上，而他已经从猪上摔下来了。但是，其实本来他就该掉下来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We have to make them laugh," Penny had said, pleading. "We have to make them like us. If we give them a show, it will help them forget. Please, m'lord." And somehow, somewise, someway he had consented. It must have been the rum. The captain's wine had been the first thing to run out. You could get drunk much quicker on rum than on wine, Tyrion Lannister had discovered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们得让他们发笑，”佩妮恳求道，“我们得让他们喜欢我们。若我们为他们上演一场滑稽秀，他们可能会忘掉一切。求求你了，大人。”接着不知道怎么着，哪根筋搭错了，天晓得他怎么竟然同意了。那一定是朗姆酒的作用。船长储备的葡萄酒是第一个喝光的。提利昂已经发现被朗姆灌醉可比葡萄酒容易多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he found himself clad in Groat's painted wooden armor, astride Groat's sow, whilst Groat's sister instructed him in the finer points of the mummer's joust that had been their bread and salt. It had a certain delicious irony to it, considering that Tyrion had almost lost his head once by refusing to mount the dog for his nephew's twisted amusement. Yet somehow he found it difficult to appreciate the humor of it all from sowback.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他发现自己穿着格罗特的喷漆木制盔甲，跨坐在格罗特的母猪上，而与此同时格罗特的妹妹用侏儒骑士秀的矛尖指着他，这些以前都是他们的维持生计的手段。考虑到提利昂曾经差点因为拒绝为他侄子扭曲的娱乐骑上一条狗而掉脑袋，现在的一切都有一种怡人的讽刺。但是他发觉骑在一头猪的悲伤很难欣赏这种幽默。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wooden armor made rising awkward. He found himself flailing like a turtle on its back. That, at least, set a few of the sailors to laughing. A shame I did not break my leg, that would have left them howling. And if they had been in that privy when I shot my father through the bowels, they might have laughed hard enough to shit their breeches right along with him. But anything to keep the bloody bastards sweet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于一身木制铠甲，他发觉要站起来显得很困难，像站在龟背上跌跌撞撞。那，至少还是让一些水手发笑了。没摔断腿还真遗憾，那样的话他们就该嚎叫了。若他们当时和我一起在那个厕所里的话，估计他们就笑到和他一样直接拉在裤子里了。但是无论如何都得让这些该死的杂种高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Easy as falling off a pig… though falling off this particular pig was harder than it looked. Tyrion curled into a ball as he dropped, remembering his lesson, but even so, he hit the deck with a solid thump and bit his tongue so hard he tasted blood. He felt as if he were twelve again, cartwheeling across the supper table in Casterly Rock's great hall. Back then his uncle Gerion had been on hand to praise his efforts, in place of surly sailors. Their laughter seemed sparse and strained compared to the great gales that had greeted Groat's and Penny's antics at Joffrey's wedding feast, and some hissed at him in anger. " No-Nose, you ride same way you look, ugly," one man shouted from the sterncastle. "Must have no balls, let girl beat you." He wagered coin on me, Tyrion decided. He let the insult wash right over him. He had heard worse in his time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就像从一头猪上摔下来一样简单…但是从这头猪上摔下来并不像看上去的那么容易。提利昂摔下时缩成一团，像以前教他的那样，但是即使这样他还是实打实的撞上甲板咬到舌头出血。他有感觉回到了十二岁那年，在凯岩城大厅的桌上翻着跟头。只是那时是他的叔叔吉利安拍手称赞他的成就，而非现在这些坏脾气的水手。与乔佛里婚礼上佩妮和格罗特的骑士秀得到的如雷的喝彩相比，现在他们得到的可谓勉强而稀疏，甚至有人生气的对他发出嘘声。“‘没鼻子’，你的骑术就像你长的那样，难看的要命，”一个人从后船楼朝他大叫。“肯定没蛋，只能挨女孩的打。”提利昂确定，那人在我身上下注了。他听人侮辱劈头盖脸席卷而来，他听过糟的多的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They will when we get better." Penny pulled off her helm. Mouse-brown hair spilled down to her ears.

<div class="line_en">He was on the point of refusing when a shout from one of the mates spared him the necessity. It was midmorning, and the captain wanted the boats out again. The cog's huge striped sail hung limply from her mast, as it had for days, but he was hopeful that they could find a wind somewhere to the north. That meant rowing. The boats were small, however, and the cog was large; towing it was hot, sweaty, exhausting work that left the hands blistered and the back aching, and accomplished nothing. The crew hated it. Tyrion could not blame them. "The widow should have put us on a galley," he muttered sourly. "If someone could help me out of these bloody planks, I would be grateful. I think I may have a splinter through my crotch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他正准备拒绝时，一个自由人船员发出一声叫喊直接省去了他开口的麻烦。此时约上午十点，而船长又想起桨开船了。船帆无力的耷拉在桅杆上，和它几天来一样的无所作为，但是船长倒是一直满怀期望他们能遇上一股北方来的风。这意味着他们得划船。那些桨小的很，而船倒是很大，；划船让人满身汗臭体温上升，这番累人的工作只让手掌气泡后背酸痛而一事无成。船员们都讨厌这么做。提利昂不好责怪他们。“那个寡妇应该把我们送上一艘战舰，”他低声牢骚。“若有人能把我救出这些该死的木板，我感激不尽。我会让一块木头碎片穿过我的胯下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some of the sailors were shouting at them and slamming their heels against the deck, demanding another tilt. The ship's cook was the loudest, as always. Tyrion had learned to despise that man, even if he was the only half-decent cyvasse player on the cog. "You see, they liked us," Penny said, with a hopeful little smile. "Shall we go again, Hugor?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Mormont did the duty, albeit with poor grace. Penny collected her dog and pig and led them both below. "You might want to tell your lady to keep her door closed and barred when she's inside," Ser Jorah said as he was undoing the buckles on the straps that joined the wooden breastplate to the backplate. "I'm hearing too much talk about ribs and hams and bacon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫尔蒙尽了他的本分，虽然没有什么风度。佩妮召唤她的狗和猪把他们带回下面。“你可能得告诉你的小姐在她待在里面的时候关好门插上门闩，”乔拉爵士一边解开连接木质胸甲和后护板的带子上的扣环一边说。“我听到了够多关于肋排火腿和培根的谈话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As you wish." His tunic was soaked with sweat and clinging to his chest. Tyrion plucked at it, wishing for a bit of breeze. The wooden armor was as hot and heavy as it was uncomfortable. Half of it looked to be old paint, layer on layer on layer of it, from a hundred past repaintings. At Joffrey's wedding feast, he recalled, one rider had displayed the direwolf of Robb Stark, the other the arms and colors of Stannis Baratheon. "We will need both animals if we're to tilt for Queen Daenerys," he said. If the sailors took it in their heads to butcher Pretty Pig, neither he nor Penny could hope to stop them… but Ser Jorah's longsword might give them pause, at least.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如你所愿。”他的上衣浸满了汗紧贴在胸上。提利昂把它拽起来希望能有点微风。木制铠甲又热又重，于它的不舒适性相比有过之而无不及。它的一半看起来都是旧漆的，一层刷在另一层上，这样反复上百次。他回想起在乔佛里的婚礼晚宴上，有个骑手展示的是罗柏·史塔克的冰原狼，另一个的武器和颜色都是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩。“这两个动物都得有，这样我们才能为丹妮莉丝女王表演，”他说。若那些水手带走了它就会宰了美丽猪，他和佩妮却束手无策…但是至少乔拉爵士的长剑可能会吓退他们一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

Or could it be that you were running, that your dragon queen sent you from her side? But why would she… oh, wait, you were spying on her." Tyrion made a clucking sound. "You hope to buy your way back into her favor by presenting her with me. An ill-considered scheme, I'd say. One might even say an act of drunken desperation. Perhaps if I were Jaime… but Jaime killed her father, I only killed my own. You think Daenerys will execute me and pardon you, but the reverse is just as likely.

He liked Penny, he pitied Penny, he even admired Penny in a way, but he did not desire her. He had no wish to hurt her, though; the gods and his sweet sister had given her enough pain.

<div class="line_en">In the end, they did not drown… though there were times when the prospect of a nice, peaceful drowning had a certain appeal. The storm raged for the rest of that day and well into the night. Wet winds howled around them and waves rose like the fists of drowned giants to smash down on their decks. Above, they learned later, a mate and two sailors were swept overboard, the ship's cook was blinded when a kettle of hot grease flew up into his face, and the captain was thrown from the stern-castle to the main deck so violently he broke both legs. Below, Crunch howled and barked and snapped at Penny, and Pretty Pig began to shit again, turning the cramped, damp cabin into a sty. Tyrion managed to avoid retching his way through all of this, chiefly thanks to the lack of wine. Penny was not so fortunate, but he held her anyway as the ship's hull creaked and groaned alarmingly around them, like a cask about to burst.</div>

Looking at the two of them, it was hard to know who was comforting whom. The sight was so grotesque it should have been hilarious, but Tyrion could not even find a smile. The girl deserves better than a pig, he thought. An honest kiss, a little kindness, everyone deserves that much, however big or small. He looked about for his wine cup, but when he found it all the rum had spilled. Drowning is bad enough, he reflected sourly, but drowning sad and sober, that's too cruel.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind returned as a whispered threat, cold and damp, brushing over his cheek, flapping the wet sail, swirling and tugging at Moqorro's scarlet robes. Some instinct made Tyrion grab hold of the nearest rail, just in time. In the space of three heartbeats the little breeze became a howling gale. Moqorro shouted something, and green flames leapt from the dragon's maw atop his staff to vanish in the night. Then the rains came, black and blinding, and forecastle and sterncastle both vanished behind a wall of water. Something huge flapped overhead, and Tyrion glanced up in time to see the sail taking wing, with two men still dangling from the lines. Then he heard a crack. Oh, bloody hell, he had time to think, that had to be the mast.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nearby midnight the winds finally died away, and the sea grew calm enough for Tyrion to make his way back up onto deck. What he saw there did not reassure him. The cog was drifting on a sea of dragonglass beneath a bowl of stars, but all around the storm raged on. East, west, north, south, everywhere he looked, the clouds rose up like black mountains, their tumbled slopes and collossal cliffs alive with blue and purple lightning. No rain was falling, but the decks were slick and wet underfoot.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion could hear someone screaming from below, a thin, high voice hysterical with fear. He could hear Moqorro too. The red priest stood on the forecastle facing the storm, his staff raised above his head as he boomed a prayer. Amidships, a dozen sailors and two of the fiery fingers were struggling with tangled lines and sodden canvas, but whether they were trying to raise the sail again or pull it down he never knew. Whatever they were doing, it seemed to him a very bad idea. And so it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">He found a line and pulled on it, fighting toward the hatch to get himself below out of the storm, but a gust of wind knocked his feet from under him and a second slammed him into the rail and there he clung. Rain lashed at his face, blinding him. His mouth was full of blood again. The ship groaned and growled beneath him like a constipated fat man straining to shit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发现一根绳索于是紧抓着它，往活门口挣扎着，希望能摆脱风暴下到下面去，但是一阵狂风把他从地面拽起，将他摔在了围栏上，他赶紧抓住。雨水鞭打着它的脸让他睁不开眼。他的嘴又一次充满了血。他下面的船像一个努力拉屎的便秘者一样呻吟咆哮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time the storm abated and the surviving passengers and crew came crawling back on deck, like pale pink worms wriggling to the surface after a rain, the Selaesori Qhoran was a broken thing, floating low in the water and listing ten degrees to port, her hull sprung in half a hundred places, her hold awash in seawater, her mast a splintered ruin no taller than a dwarf. Even her figurehead had not escaped; one of his arms had broken off, the one with all his scrolls. Nine men had been lost, including a mate, two of the fiery fingers, and Moqorro himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到风暴消退，幸存的乘客和船员都像雨后苍粉的蠕虫蠕动到地表一般爬回了甲板上，Selaesori Qhoran号完全是个破烂了，勉强浮在水面足足倾斜了十度，船身千疮百孔，船舱几乎被海水淹没了，桅杆只剩下一个比侏儒还矮的刺桩。即使是船首像也未能幸免；他的那只抱着卷轴的手臂折断。九个人失踪了，其中包括一个大副，两个火焰手指和莫阔罗本人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion never saw it, but he heard it. That cracking sound again and then a scream of tortured wood, and suddenly the air was full of shards and splinters. One missed his eye by half an inch, a second found his neck, a third went through his calf, boots and breeches and all. He screamed. But he held on to the line, held on with a desperate strength he did not know he had. The widow said this ship would never reach her destination, he remembered. Then he laughed and laughed, wild and hysterical, as thunder boomed and timbers moaned and waves crashed all around him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂没看见，但是他听到了。接着又是一声碎裂声，引发了一场木头扭曲的尖叫，一瞬间空气中就充满了木质碎片。一个飞过的木片仅仅差半寸就刺到他的眼睛了，而另一个插入了他的脖子，第三片则穿过他的腿肚靴子屁股等等。他尖叫起来。但还是紧抓着绳索，他简直不能相信自己还有这番力气。他想起寡妇说过这艘船永远不会到达她的目的地。接着他就在雷鸣劲浪和木材的呻吟中狂暴而歇斯底里的大笑个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Prophecy is like a half-trained mule," he complained to Jorah Mormont. "It looks as though it might be useful, but the moment you trust in it, it kicks you in the head. That bloody widow knew the ship would never reach her destination, she warned us of that, said Benerro saw it in his fires, only I took that to mean… well, what does it matter?" His mouth twisted. "What it really meant was that some bloody big storm would turn our mast to kindling so we could drift aimlessly across the Gulf of Grief until our food ran out and we started eating one another. Who do you suppose they'll carve up first… the pig, the dog, or me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The captain died the following day, the ship's cook three nights later. It was all that the remaining crew could do to keep the wreck afloat. The mate who had assumed command reckoned that they were somewhere off the southern end of the Isle of Cedars. When he lowered the ship's boats to tow them toward the nearest land, one sank and the men in the other cut the line and rowed off north, abandoning the cog and all their shipmates.</div>

<div class="line_en">For nineteen days they drifted, as food and water dwindled. The sun beat down on them, relentless. Penny huddled in her cabin with her dog and her pig, and Tyrion brought her food, limping on his bandaged calf and sniffing at the wound by night. When he had nothing else to do, he pricked his toes and fingers too. Ser Jorah made a point of sharpening his sword each day, honing the point until it gleamed. The three remaining fiery fingers lit the nightfire as the sun went down, but they wore their ornate armor as they led the crew in prayer, and their spears were close at hand. And not a single sailor tried to rub the head of either dwarf.</div>

<div class="line_en">The deck was moving under him, and for half a heartbeat he was so confused he thought he was back on the Shy Maid. A whiff of pigshit brought him to his senses. The Sorrows were behind him, half a world away, and the joys of that time as well. He remembered how sweet Le-more had looked after her morning swims, with beads of water glistening on her naked skin, but the only maiden here was his poor Penny, the stunted little dwarf girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他身下的甲板在懂，而有一瞬间，他以为他又回到了害羞小姐号上。一点猪粪气味让他清醒过来。伤心地已经是往事了，在半个世界外的地方，那些欢乐也已是过眼云烟。他回忆起莱莫尔晨浴后的可爱样子，她裸露的肌肤上那一股股水流，而现在这里唯一的少女就只有可怜的佩妮，一个发育迟缓的小侏儒女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Something was afoot, though. Tyrion slipped from the hammock, yawning, and looked about for his boots. And mad though it was, he looked for the crossbow as well, but of course there was none such to be found. A pity, he mused, it might have been some use when the big folk come to eat me. He pulled his boots on and climbed on deck to see what the shouting was about. Penny was there before him, her eyes wide with wonder. "A sail," she shouted, "there, there, do you see? A sail, and they've seen us, they have. A sail."</div>
