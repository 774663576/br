<div class="line_en">The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有壁炉台上的照片显示出流逝了多少时光。十年前，这里摆放着许多照片，看上去就像戴着五颜六色婴儿帽的一只粉红色的大海滩气球，只是达力已不再是婴儿了，照片上是一个大头男孩骑着他的第一辆自行车，在博览会上乘坐旋转木马，跟父亲玩电脑游戏，被母亲拥着亲吻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许和哈利长年住在黑洞洞的碗柜里有些关系，他显得比他的同龄人瘦小他看上去甚至比他实际的身材还要瘦小，因为他只能穿达力的旧衣服，而达力要比他高大三四倍。哈利有一张消瘦的面孔、膝盖骨突出的膝盖、乌黑的头发和一对翠绿的眼睛。他戴着一副用许多透明胶带粘在一起的圆框眼镜，因为达力总用拳头揍他的鼻子。哈利对自己的外表最喜欢的就是额头上那道像闪电似的淡淡的疤痕。这道疤痕从他记事起就有了，他记得他问佩妮姨妈的第一个问题就是这道伤疤是怎么落下的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他穿好了衣服，顺着走廊来到厨房里。餐桌几乎被达力的生日礼物堆得满满的。看来达力收到了他想要的新电脑，至于第二台电视机，还有跑车就更不在话下了。达力为什么想要一辆赛车，这对于哈利来说，是一个谜，因为达力胖乎乎的，而且讨厌锻炼。当然，除非这种锻炼包括拳脚相加。他最喜欢的拳击吊球就是哈利，可他并不是经常能抓住他。哈利看起来很单薄，但他动作机敏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎每周一次，弗农姨父从他的报纸上方看看哈利，对哈利大喊大叫说他该去理发了。哈利理发的次数要比他班上所有的同学理发次数的总和还要多，可一点也不起作用，他的头发照旧疯长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，那就三十七件。”达力说，他的脸涨得通红。哈利看得出达力就要大发雷霆了，于是趁达力还没有把餐桌掀翻，连忙狼吞虎咽，把他的一份熏咸肉一扫而光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, "And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents.

<div class="line_en">Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达力吓得张口结舌，哈利却高兴得心里怦怦直跳。每年达力生日那一天，他的父母总带着他和另一位朋友出去玩一天，上游乐园，吃汉堡包或是看电影。把哈利留给费格太太，一个住在离这里有两条街的疯老婆子。哈利讨厌费格太太住的地方，满屋子都是卷心菜味；费格太太还非要他看她过去养过的几只猫咪的照片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在怎么办？”佩妮姨妈气急败坏地看着哈利，仿佛这一切都是哈利一手策划的。哈利知道他应当为费格太太摔断腿感到难过，但是当他想到要整整一年之后他才会再见到踢踢、雪儿、爪子先生和毛毛（都是猫的名字），他又觉得难过不起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.</div>

Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.

Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood.

A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.

A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.
