<div class="line_en">Most of the spectators testified to having seen, on the breast of the unhappy minister, a SCARLET LETTER-the very semblance of that worn by Hester Prynne-imprinted in the flesh. As regarded its origin, there were various explanations, all of which must necessarily have been conjectural. Some affirmed that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very day when Hester Prynne first wore her ignominious badge, had begun a course of penance, -- which he afterwards, in so many futile methods, followed out, -- by inflicting a hideous torture on himself. Others contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent, when old Roger Chillingworth, being a potent necromancer, had caused it to appear, through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs. Others, again, -- and those best able to appreciate the minister's peculiar sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon the body, -- whispered their belief, that the awful symbol was the effect of the ever active tooth of remorse, gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven's dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter. The reader may choose among these theories. We have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent, and would gladly, now that it has done its office, erase its deep print out of our own brain; where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is singular, nevertheless, that certain persons, who were spectators of the whole scene, and professed never once to have removed their eyes from the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, denied that there was any mark whatever on his breast, more than on a new-born infant's. Neither, by their report, had his dying words acknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any, the slightest connection, on his part, with the guilt for which Hester Prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter. According to these highly respectable witnesses, the minister, conscious that he was dying, -- conscious, also, that the reverence of the multitude placed him already among saints and angels, -- had desired, by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman, to express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of man's own righteousness. After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind's spiritual good, he had made the manner of his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite Purity, we are sinners all alike. It was to teach them, that the holiest among us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern more clearly the Mercy which looks down, and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit, which would look aspiringly upward. Without disputing a truth so momentous, we must be allowed to consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale's story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a man's friends-and especially a clergyman's-will sometimes uphold his character; when proofs, clear as the mid-day sunshine on the scarlet letter, establish him a false and sin-stained creature of the dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，也有一些从头至尾都在场的人持有异议，他们声明，他们的跟睛始终没离开道丁梅斯代尔牧师先生，但他们否认曾经在他胸脯上看到有任何表记，那上面和新生婴儿的胸脯一样光洁。据他们讲，他的临终致辞，既没有承认，也没有丝毫暗示，他同海丝特·白兰长期以来戴着的红字所代表的罪过有过些微的牵连。按照这些极其值得尊敬的证人的说法，牧师意识到自己形将辞世，也意识到了众人已经把他尊崇到圣者和天使中间，于是便希望能在那堕落的女人的怀抱中咽气，以便向世界表明，一个人类的精英的正直是多么微不足道。他在竭力为人类的精神的美好耗尽了生命之后，又以他自己死的方式作为一种教谕，用这个悲恸有力的教训使他的崇拜者深信：在无比纯洁的上帝的心目中，我们都是相差无几的罪人。他要教育他们：我们当中最神圣的人无非比别人高得能够更清楚地分辨俯视下界的仁慈的上帝，能够更彻底地否定一般人翘首企望的人类功绩的幻影。对这样一个事关重大的真理，我们毋庸争辩，不过，应该允许我们把有关丁梅斯代尔先生的故事的这种说法，仅仅看作是那种墨守忠诚的实例，证明一个人的朋友们——尤其是一个牧师的朋友们，即使在证据确凿得如同正午的阳光照在红字上一般，指明他是尘埃中一个虚伪和沾满罪恶的生物时，有时还要维护他的人格。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing was more remarkable than the change which took place, almost immediately after Mr. Dimmesdale's death, in the appearance and demeanour of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth. All his strength and energy-all his vital and intellectual force-seemed at once to desert him; insomuch that he positively withered up, shrivelled away, and almost vanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in the sun. This unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge; and when, by its completest triumph and consummation, that evil principle was left with no further material to support it, -- when, in short, there was no more devil's work on earth for him to do, it only remained for the unhumanized mortal to betake himself whither his Master would find him tasks enough, and pay him his wages duly. But, to all these shadowy beings, so long our near acquaintances, -- as well Roger Chillingworth as his companions, -- we would fain be merciful. It is a curious subject of observation and inquiry, whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom. Each, in its utmost development, supposes a high degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge; each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another; each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his object. Philosophically considered, therefore, the two passions seem essentially the same, except that one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance, and the other in a dusky and lurid glow. In the spiritual world, the old physician and the minister-mutual victims as they have been-may, unawares, have found their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最引人注目的是，丁梅斯代尔先生死后不久，在被叫作罗杰·齐灵渥斯的那老人容貌和举止上所发生的变化。他的全部体力和精力——他的全部活力和智力，象是立即抛弃了他；以致他明显地凋谢了，枝萎了，几乎如同拔出地面、绘太阳晒蔫的野草一般从人们眼界中消失了。这个不快的人给自己的生活确立的准则是不断地按部就班地执行他的复仇计划；但是，当他取得了彻底的胜利和完满的结果，那一邪恶的准则再也没有物质来支撑的时候，简言之，当他在世上再也没有魔鬼给的任务可进行的时候，这个没有人性曲人只有到他的主中那里去谋职并领取相应的报酬了。然而，对于所有这些阴影式的人物，只要是我们的熟人——不管是罗杰·齐灵渥斯，抑或是他的伙伴，我们还不得不显示点仁慈。一个值得探讨的、引人人胜的课题是：恨和爱，归根结底是不是同一的东西。二者在发展到极端时，都必须是高度的密不可分和息患相通；二者都可以使一个人向对方谋求爱慕和精神生活的食粮；二者在完成其课题之后，都能够将自己热爱的人或痛恨的人同样置于孤寂凄凉的境地。因此，从哲学上看，这两种感情在本质上似乎是相同的，只不过一种刚好显现于神圣的天光中，而另一种则隐蔽在晦暗的幽光里。老医生和牧师这两个事实上相互成为牺牲品的人，在神灵的世界中，或许会．不知不觉地发现他俩在尘世所贮藏的怨恨和厌恶变成了黄金般的热爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of business to communicate to the reader. At old Roger Chillingworth's decease (which took place within the year), and by his last will and testament, of which Governor Bellingham and the Reverend Mr. Wilson were executors, he bequeathed a very considerable amount of property, both here and in England, to little Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们先把这一讨论撇在一旁，把一件正事通报给读者。不出一年，老罗杰·齐灵渥斯便死了；根据他的最后意愿和遗嘱——贝灵汉总督和威尔逊牧师先生是其执行人——，他把一笔数目可观的遗产，包括在此地和在英国的，都留给了海丝特·白兰的女儿，小珠儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the threshold she paused, -- turned partly round, -- for, perchance, the idea of entering, all alone, and all so changed,  the home of so intense a former life, was more dreary and desolate than even she could bear. But her hesitation was only for an instant, though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her breast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在门限处停下了脚步，还侧转了身体，或许，只身一人走进以往过着提心吊胆生活、如今已经面貌全非的家，连她都受不了那种阴森凄凉的劲头。但她只迟疑了片刻，不过人们还是来得及看到她胸前的红字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Hester Prynne had returned, and taken up her long-forsaken shame. But where was little Pearl? If still alive, she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood. None knew-nor ever learned, with the fulness of perfect certainty-whether the elf-child had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had been softened and subdued, and made capable of a woman's gentle happiness. But, through the remainder of Hester's life, there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land. Letters came, with armorial seals upon them, though of bearings unknown to English heraldry. In the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury, such as Hester never cared to use, but which only wealth could have purchased, and affection have imagined for her. There were trifles, too, little ornaments, beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance, that must have been wrought by delicate fingers, at the impulse of a fond heart. And, once, Hester was seen embroidering a baby-garment, with such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult, had any infant, thus apparelled, been shown to our sobre-hued community.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特·白兰又回来了，又拣起了久已抛弃的耻辱！可是小珠儿在哪里呢？如果她还活着，如今应该是个楚楚动人的少女了。谁也不知道，谁也没有得到十足确切的消息，那个小精灵般的孩于是不是早已过早地埋进了少女的坟墓，还是她那狂野而多彩的本性已经被软化和驯服，从而得以享受一个女人的温雅的幸福。不过，从海丝特后半世的生活来看，有迹象表明，这位佩戴红字的幽居者是居住在另一片国度里的某个人热爱和关怀的对象。寄来的信件上印有纹章，不过那是英格兰家系上所没有记载的。在那间茅屋里，有一些奢侈的享受品，这些东西海丝特是从来不屑一用的，但这些东西只有富人才能买得起，只有对她充满感情的人才会想得到。还有一些小玩艺儿，一些小小的饰物，以及一些表示持续的怀念的精美的纪念品，想必是一颗爱心冲动之财，用一双纤手制作的。有一次，人们看到海丝特在刺绣一件婴儿的袍服，那种华美的样式和奢侈的色彩，如果有哪个婴儿穿在身上在我们这晦暗的居民区中招摇，一定会引起轩然大波的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In fine, the gossips of that day believed, -- and Mr. Surveyor Pue, who made investigations a century later, believed, -- and one of his recent successors in office, moreover, faithfully believes, -- that Pearl was not only alive, but married, and happy, and mindful of her mother; and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside.</div>

<div class="line_en">So said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet letter. And, after many, many years, a new grave was delved, near an old and sunken one, in that burial-ground beside which King's Chapel has since been built. It was near that old and sunken grave, yet with a space between, as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle. Yet one tombstone served for both. All around, there were monuments carved with armorial bearings; and on this simple slab of slate-as the curious investigator may still discern, and perplex himself with the purport-there appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon. It bore a device, a herald's wording of which might serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend; so sombre is it, and relieved only by one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than the shadow: --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特·白兰就一边这么说着，一边垂下双眸瞅着那红字。又经过许多许多年之后，在一座下陷的老坟附近，又挖了一座新坟，地点就是后来在一旁建起王家教堂的那块墓地。这座新坟靠近那座下陷的老坟，但中间留着一处空地，仿佛两位长眠者的骨殖无权相混。然而两座坟却共用一块墓碑。周围全是刻着家族纹章的碑石；而在这一方简陋的石板上——好奇的探索者仍会看见，却不明所以了——有着类似盾形纹章的刻痕。上面所刻的铭文，是一个专司宗谱纹章的官员的词句，可以充当我们现在结束的这个传说的箴言和简短描述；这传说实在阴惨，只有一点比阴影还要幽暗的永恒的光斑稍稍给人一点宽慰：">查看中文翻译</div>
