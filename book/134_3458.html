<div class="line_en">Carol wanted her with her, and whatever happened they would meet it without running. How was it possible to be afraid and in love, Therese thought. The two things did not go together. How was it possible to be afraid, when the two of them grew stronger together every day? And every night. Every night was different, and every morning. Together they possessed a miracle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔希望她跟着她，无论发生什么事，她们都会坦然面对。特芮丝心想，怎么才能在恋爱的同时，心里又怀着担忧惧怕。爱情和担忧这两件事情，是无法并存的。她们两人每天在一起相处，越来越坚强，怎么有可能害怕呢？还有每个夜晚，每个夜晚都不一样；还有每天早晨。她们只要在一起，就一定能够拥有奇迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The road into Estes Park slanted downward. The snowdrifts piled higher and higher on either side, and then the lights began, strung along the fir trees, arching over the road. It was a village of brown logged houses and shops and hotels. There was music, and people walked in the bright street with their heads lifted up, as if they were enchanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往艾斯特斯公园的下坡路蜿蜒曲折。积雪在两边越堆越高，接着出现了灯光，沿路悬挂在冷杉树上，在路上形成一个拱形。她们接近一个小村落，都是褐色的木屋，还有商店和饭店。路上可以听见音乐，行人走在明亮的街道上，每个人都把头抬高，仿佛着了魔一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Denver, Carol stopped and sold her diamond engagement ring at a jeweler's. Therese felt a little disturbed by it, but Carol said the ring meant nothing to her and she loathed diamonds anyway. And it was quicker than wiring her bank for money. Carol wanted to stop at a hotel a few miles out from Colorado Springs, where she had been before, but she changed her mind almost as soon as they got there. It was too much like a resort, she said, so they went to a hotel that backed on the town and faced the mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过丹佛的时候，卡罗尔停了下来，把自己的订婚钻石戒指卖给了珠宝商。特芮丝心里觉得有点不安，但是卡罗尔说这个戒指对她已经没有意义了，反正她也不喜欢钻石，而且卖戒指还比银行汇钱快。卡罗尔想去科罗拉多泉几英里外一家她曾经去过的饭店。但等到两人快要抵达的时候，卡罗尔又改变了心意，还说这里太像度假胜地了。所以她们又跑到小城后面，找到一家面山的饭店住下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their room was long from the door to the square floor-length windows that overlooked a garden, and beyond, the red and white mountains. There were touches of white in the garden, odd little pyramids of stone, a white bench or a chair, and the garden looked foolish compared to the magnificent land that surrounded it, the flat sweep that rose up into mountains upon mountains, filling the horizon like half a world. The room had blond furniture about the color of Carol's hair, and there was a bookcase as smooth as she could want it, with some good books amid the bad ones, and Therese knew she would never read any of them while they were here. A painting of a woman in a large black hat and a red scarf hung above the bookcase, and on the wall near the door was spread a pelt of brown leather, not a real pelt but something someone had cut out of a piece of brown suede. Above it was a tin lantern with a candle. Carol also rented the room next to them, which had a connecting door, though they did not use it even to put their suitcases in. They planned to stay a week, or longer if they liked it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们的房间从入门处到另一头的落地窗之间隔着好长的距离。窗户俯瞰着庭园，庭园后面则是红白相间的山峦。庭园里点缀着点点白色，或者是奇特的小石头堆，或者是一个白色的凳子或椅子。与四周壮观的山色比较起来，这个小庭园看起来有点可笑。广阔的大地向前延伸，又隆起形成峰峰相连的高山，填满了远处的地平线，如同半个世界。房间里面的家具是金色的，接近卡罗尔的发色。而书架就像特芮丝喜欢的那样平滑，上面夹杂好书和坏书。特芮丝知道，她们两人住在这个房间里面的时候，自己绝对没时间去读架子上的任何一本书。书架上方挂了一幅图画，画里面的仕女戴着黑色大帽子和红色围巾。靠门的墙上则铺着一片褐色的毛皮，其实那不是真正完整的毛皮，只是从一块褐色麂皮上面割下来的东西而已，它的上方是一盏金属烛台。卡罗尔把紧邻的房间也租下来了，两个房间有道门可以相互连通，不过她们没有使用紧邻的房间，甚至连行李箱也没有放进去。她们计划在这里停留一整个星期，如果喜欢这里的话，继续待下去也没关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was so, of course. There was even the remotest chance that the detective had seen them when they drove back through Salt Lake City, and followed them. If he didn't find them in Salt Lake City, he might inquire at the hotels. She knew that was why Carol had left the Denver address, in fact, because they hadn't intended to go to Denver. Therese flung herself in the armchair, and looked at Carol. Carol took the trouble to search for a dictaphone, but her attitude was arrogant. She had even invited trouble by coming here. And the explanation, the resolution of those contradictory facts was nowhere but in Carol herself, unresolved, in her slow, restless step as she walked to the door now and turned, in the nonchalant lift of her head, and in the nervous line of her eyebrows that registered irritation in one second and in the next were serene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然也有这个可能。她们穿过盐湖城往回开的时候，说不定会有万分之一的机会，她们两人被那个侦探看见了，然后就一直跟踪着她们。如果他在盐湖城找不到她们，他可能会问遍了每个饭店。特芮丝知道，卡罗尔之所以故意在盐湖城的旅馆留下丹佛的联络地址，原因就在于此，因为她们两人根本不打算去丹佛。特芮丝坐在扶手椅上看着卡罗尔。卡罗尔大费周章在房子里找寻有没有窃听录音机，但她的态度很自负。她们两人身在这里，甚至就是在自找麻烦。只有卡罗尔自己才知道该如何解释或解决这些矛盾的状况。卡罗尔的心意游移不定，时而缓慢又焦躁地朝着门来回踱步，时而冷静地抬起头，她紧张的眉毛一下子流露出怒气，下一秒又归于平静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol blew her smoke up into the air. "I don't give a damn. I hope the papers find out about it and rub Harge's nose in his own mess. I hope he wastes fifty thousand dollars. Do you want to take that trip that bankrupts the English language this afternoon? Did you ask Mrs. French yet?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese looked at the big room, up at the high ceiling, at the large square, plain bed, the room that for all its modernness had a curiously old-fashioned, ample air about it that she associated with the American West, like the oversized Western saddles she had seen in the riding stable downstairs. A kind of cleanness, as well. Yet Carol looked for a dictaphone. Therese watched her, walking back toward her, still in her pajamas and robe. She had an impulse to go to Carol, crush her in her arms, pull her down on the bed, and the fact that she didn't now made her tense and alert filled her with a repressed but reckless exhilaration.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a six- or seven-hour trip to the Cripple Creek gold mine, over Ute Pass and down a mountain. Mrs. French went with them, talking the whole time. She was a woman of about seventy, with a Maryland accent and a hearing aid, ready to get out of the car and climb anywhere, though she had to be helped every foot of the way. Therese felt very anxious about her, though she actually disliked even touching her. She felt if Mrs. French fell, she would break in a million pieces. Carol and Mrs. French talked about the State of Washington, which Mrs. French knew well, since she had lived there for the past few years with one of her sons. Carol asked a few questions, and Mrs. French told her all about her ten years of traveling since her husband's death, and about her two sons, the one in Washington and the one in Hawaii who worked for a pineapple company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们准备前往克里普尔溪金矿，车程就要六七个小时，中途会穿越乌特关口，然后朝山下前行。沿路弗兰奇太太一直不断地讲话。她年约七十，说话时带着马里兰州的口音，还戴着助听器，兴致勃勃地想要下车到处走，但她一路上每一步都必须有人搀扶。特芮丝很生她的气，连扶都不想扶她一下。她觉得如果弗兰奇太太摔倒的话，她一定会碎成几万块碎片。卡罗尔却和弗兰奇太太谈着华盛顿州的情形。弗兰奇太太这几年来和她的一个儿子就住在华盛顿州，所以对当地相当熟悉。卡罗尔问了几个问题，弗兰奇太太则把她丈夫去世后到现在十年间她去过的地方事无巨细地对她说了，还附带介绍了她两个儿子的情况，一个在华盛顿州，一个在夏威夷的凤梨公司上班。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two men, one named Dave and the other whose name Therese at least did not know and did not care to, came over and asked to join them. They were the two who had come over last night in the game room and asked Carol and her to play gin rummy. Carol had declined last night. Now she said, "Of course, sit down." Carol and Dave began a conversation that sounded very interesting, but Therese was seated so that she couldn't participate very well. And the man next to Therese wanted to talk about something else, a horseback trip he had just made around Steamboat Springs. After supper, Therese waited for a sign from Carol to leave, but Carol was still deep in conversation. Therese had read about that special pleasure people got from the fact that someone they loved was attractive in the eyes of other people, too. She simply didn't have it. Carol looked at her every now and then and gave her a wink. So Therese sat there for an hour and a half, and managed to be polite, because she knew Carol wanted her to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">But there were other days when they drove out into the mountains alone, taking any road they saw. Once they came upon a little town they liked and spent the night there, without pajamas or toothbrushes, without past or future, and the night became another of those islands in time, suspended somewhere in the heart or in the memory, intact and absolute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有几天，她们独自开车上山随兴走着。有一次两人发现了一个小镇，两人都喜欢上了那个地方，于是就在那里过夜。虽然没带睡衣或牙刷，虽然没有过去或未来，但那个夜晚后来变成了一连串时间岛屿中的一座，悬挂在心头的某个地方，悬在心里或记忆里，完整无缺，独一无二。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or perhaps it was nothing but happiness, Therese thought, a complete happiness that must be rare enough, so rare that very few people ever knew it. But if it was merely happiness, then it had gone beyond the ordinary bounds and become something else, become a kind of excessive pressure, so that the weight of a coffee cup in her hand, the speed of a cat crossing the garden below, the silent crash of two clouds seemed almost more than she could bear. And just as she had not understood a month ago the phenomenon of sudden happiness, she did not understand her state now, which seemed an aftermath. It was more often painful than pleasant, and consequently she was afraid she had some grave and unique flaw. She was as afraid sometimes as if she were walking about with a broken spine. If she ever had an impulse to tell Carol, the words dissolved before she began, in fear and in her usual mistrust of her own reactions, the anxiety that her reactions were like no one else's, and that therefore not even Carol could understand them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许幸福就是这样。特芮丝想，这种幸福是完整的，罕见的，只有很少人体验过。如果幸福就是这样，那么这份幸福早就已经超越了幸福的极限，已经变成其他东西了，变成一种过度的压力了。这样一来，手上咖啡杯的重量、小猫跑过庭园的速度、两片云朵无声的接触，几乎全都超过她能承受的范围了。这就好像才不过一个月以前，当时的她还无法理解这份突如其来的幸福究竟是什么；当时的她也不能理解自己所处的状态。而自己现在的处境，又好像是某种事情所造成的后果。通常，痛苦的时间远比快乐的时间还多，最后她竟然担心自己身上会出现重大而罕见的缺陷，开始担心自己仿佛拖着断裂的脊背四处走动。就算自己出自冲动，想要把这种感觉告诉卡罗尔，但这些话在她还没开口之前也会烟消云散，被她的恐惧所淹没；再加上她向来怀疑自己的反应，因此这些话也会淹没在这份怀疑中。她怀疑自己对于事物的反应跟别人都不一样，因此连卡罗尔也无法理解她的反应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the mornings, they generally drove out somewhere in the mountains and left the car so they could climb up a hill. They drove aimlessly over the zigzagging roads that were like white chalk lines connecting mountain point to mountain point. From a distance, one could see clouds lying about the projecting peaks, so it seemed they flew along in space, a little closer to heaven than to earth. Therese's favorite spot was on the highway above Cripple Creek, where the road clung suddenly to the rim of a gigantic depression. Hundreds of feet below, lay the tiny disorder of the abandoned mining town. There the eye and the brain played tricks with each other, for it was impossible to keep a steady concept of the proportion below, impossible to compare it on any human scale. Her own hand held up in front of her could look Lilliputian or curiously huge. And the town occupied only a fraction of the great scoop in the earth, like a single experience, a single commonplace event, set in a certain immeasurable territory of the mind. The eye, swimming in space, returned to rest on the spot that looked like a box of matches run over by a car, the man-made confusion of the little town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天早晨，她们都会把车子开到山上某处停好，然后走路登山。她们漫无目标，开过蜿蜒曲折的山间道路，这些道路就像白色的粉笔线一样，连结着山上的一个又一个地点。远处可以看到云朵卧在突出的山峰上，这些云朵看起来又像飞舞在空间当中，距离天堂，比人间更近。特芮丝最喜欢的地点，是跨越克里普尔溪的公路，路面骤然低屈贴近巨大凹地的边缘。底下几百英尺的地方，就是略显不平整的废弃矿城。眼睛和大脑在这里互相恶作剧，肉眼望去，很难确切知晓底下的景物相对大小如何，光凭肉眼难以衡量。她自己举在眼前的手，可能看起来就像侏儒一样小，也很可能异常庞大。整个巨大的凹陷地面上，废弃的矿镇只占据了很小一部分，像个单纯的经验，一个单一的寻常事件，出现在脑海中某个无法估量的空间上。眼睛在空间中来回游动，最后停驻在一个点上。这个小黑点看起来像车子碾过的火柴盒，这个小黑点，就是人手所造出来的毫无秩序的小城镇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What do you think about Iceland in the summer?" Carol might ask, because they made a point of talking about travel, if there was a silence when they first sat down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Always Therese looked for the man with the creases on either side of his mouth, but Carol never did. Carol had not even mentioned him since their second day at Colorado Springs, and now ten days had passed. Because the restaurant of the hotel was famous, new people came every evening to the big dining room, and Therese always glanced about, not actually expecting to see him, but as a kind of precaution that had become a habit. But Carol paid no attention to anyone except Walter, their waiter, who always came up to ask what kind of cocktail they wanted that evening. Many people looked at Carol, however, because she was generally the most attractive woman in the room. And Therese was so delighted to be with her, so proud of her, she looked at no one else but Carol. Then as she read the menu, Carol would slowly press Therese's foot under the table to make her smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">One morning, there were three letters -- from Rindy, Abby, and Dannie. It was Carol's second letter from Abby, who had had no further news before, and Therese noticed Carol opened Rindy's letter first. Dannie wrote that he was still waiting to hear the outcome of two interviews about jobs and reported that Phil said Harkevy was going to do the sets for the English play called The Faint Heart in March.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天早上出现了三封信，分别是琳蒂、艾比和丹尼寄来的。卡罗尔已经接到过一封艾比寄来的信，艾比先前没提到进一步的消息，但特芮丝注意到卡罗尔先拆的就是琳蒂的信。丹尼在信中说，他还在等着那两份工作面试的结果。他另外说，菲尔提到了哈凯维三月间需要设计一出英国剧《软弱之心》的场景。">查看中文翻译</div>

Love to you and to Abby. Rindy. XX. p. s. Thank you very much for the leather shirt. Daddy bought me a two-wheel bike regular size that he said I was too small for Christmas. I am not too small.

She should write to Harkevy this afternoon, she thought, and ask him if there was a chance of an assistant's job with his group in March. She began composing the letter in her head. The mountains looked back at her like majestic red lions, staring down their noses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝起身，走到窗户边，站着眺望远山。她想，今天下午该写封信给哈凯维，问他是否有机会在三月的时候到他的团队里担任助理。她开始在脑中构思着这封信的内容。山峰回望着她，有如雄伟的红色狮子，鼻子朝下注视着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was sitting one evening at the dinner hour at a table by himself to the left of Carol and behind her. Therese choked on nothing, and put her fork down. Her heart began to beat as if it would hammer its way out of her chest. How had she gotten halfway through the meal without seeing him? She lifted her eyes to Carol's face and saw Carol watching her, reading her with the gray eyes that were not quite so calm as a moment ago. Carol had stopped in the middle of saying something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一个人独自坐在餐桌旁。晚餐时分，他就坐在卡罗尔的左边，特芮丝的后面。特芮丝虽然没有噎到，还是把叉子放下了。她的心跳加速，猛烈敲击，仿佛要跳出身体外面。她怎么会吃了一半都没有看到他？她抬起眼睛看着卡罗尔的脸，看到卡罗尔正注视着她，用灰色的眼睛端详着她，那双眼睛已经不像刚才那样平静了。卡罗尔的话才说到一半就停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese followed her, passed within twelve inches of the man whose head was lowered toward his book. Ahead of her she saw Carol's figure bend gracefully as she greeted Mrs. French, who was sitting alone at a table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝跟着她经过那个男人的身旁，距离他不过十二英寸，那个人还在低着头看书。在她的前方，她看到卡罗尔的身影正在向弗兰奇太太打招呼，优雅地弯着身子，弗兰奇太太则独自坐在一张桌子旁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The brandy helped very little, if at all. The detective did not once look at them. He was reading a book that he had propped up on the metal napkin holder, and even now Therese felt a doubt as strong as in the cafe outside Salt Lake City, an uncertainty that was somehow more horrible than the positive knowledge would be that he was the detective.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, they went down to the car and took a drive, westward into the darkness. We shall not go farther west, Therese thought. She could not stamp out the panic that danced in the very core of her, that she felt due to something gone before, something that had happened long ago, not now, not this. She was uneasy, but Carol was not. Carol was not merely pretending coolness, she really was not afraid. Carol said, what could he do, after all, but she simply didn't want to be spied upon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚稍后，两人走到楼下，开车向西进入一片漆黑之中。特芮丝想，我们不应该继续往西走。她无法压抑内心深处跳跃徘徊的恐慌，她是为了很久以前自己失去的东西而感到恐慌，为了很久以前发生的事而恐慌，不是现在，不是这件事。她觉得非常不自在，但是卡罗尔好像神态自若。卡罗尔并不是在假装冷静，她是真的不害怕。卡罗尔说过，他不敢怎么样，但是特芮丝就是不想要被人监视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Carol was shaking her head. "Would it take him nearly two weeks to trace us from Salt Lake City to here? No, he just decided to have dinner with us tonight." Carol turned from the bookshelf with a glass of brandy in her hand. The flush had left her face. Now she even smiled a little at Therese. "Clumsy fellow, isn't he?"

<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔摇摇头。“他从盐湖城一路跟踪我们到这里，需要花两个礼拜的时间吗？不会，他只是决定今晚和我们共进晚餐。”卡罗尔拿着一杯白兰地，从书架那边走回来，脸上的红晕已经消失了，甚至还对特芮丝稍微笑了一下。“笨拙的家伙，不是吗？”她坐在床上，把一个枕头摆到背后，然后朝后躺着。“嗯，我们在这里已经够久了，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
