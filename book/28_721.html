<div class="line_en">Sasha and Malia were three and six years old now, feisty, smart, and growing fast. Their energy left me breathless. Which only added to the occasional allure of the shopping plaza. There were times when I'd sit in the parked car and eat my fast food alone with the car radio playing, overcome with relief, impressed with my efficiency. This was life with little kids. This was what sometimes passed for achievement. I had the applesauce. I was eating a meal. Everyone was still alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">On Clybourn Avenue in Chicago, just north of downtown, there was a strange paradise, seemingly built for the working parent, seemingly built for me: a standard, supremely American, got-it-all strip mall. It had a BabyGap, a Best Buy, a Gymboree, and a CVS, plus a handful of other chains, small and large, meant to take care of any urgent consumer need, be it a toilet plunger, or a ripe avocado, or a child-sized bathing cap. There was also a nearby Container Store and a Chipotle, which made things even better. This was my place. I could park the car, whip through two or three stores as needed, pick up a burrito bowl, and be back at my desk inside sixty minutes. I excelled at the lunchtime blitz -- the replacing of lost socks, the purchasing of gifts for whatever five-year-old was having a birthday party on Saturday, the stocking and restocking of juice boxes and single-serving applesauce cups.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在芝加哥市区北边的克莱伯恩大道上，有一个神奇的乐园，似乎是专门为有工作的家长而建的，是专门为我而建的。那是一个标准的、超级美国式的、无所不有的购物广场。那里有一家盖璞童装店、一家百思买、一家金宝贝、一家CVS便利店，还有其他几家大大小小的连锁店，可以满足消费者的所有紧急需求，不管是疏通马桶的搋子、熟透的牛油果，还是儿童浴帽。附近还有一家肯泰纳家居日用商店和一个小辣椒墨西哥卷饼快餐店 [1]，简直是锦上添花。那里是我的心仪之地。我开车过去，快速逛两三家店，吃一个卷饼碗 [2]，然后回到办公室，时间可以控制在一小时之内。我非常擅长这种午餐时间的闪逛—买一双新袜子替换掉该丢弃的那双，给某个星期六要开生日派对的五岁孩子选礼物，储备盒装果汁和杯装苹果酱。【注：[1]小辣椒墨西哥卷饼快餐店（Chipotle），这家快餐店是一位年轻人于1993年在美国的丹佛创立的，主要供应墨西哥式的食品。食材多是新鲜的牛肉、鸡肉、猪肉，各种蔬菜、各种豆类、米饭等。它是美国市场表现最好的连锁餐饮企业之一。[2]卷饼碗（burrito bowl），卷饼的衍生食品。它和卷饼的区别在于没有了最外层的墨西哥薄饼，而是直接将原本包在薄饼内的食物和佐料倒到碗中，还可以添加诸如柠檬等调味品，形式与拌饭类似。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was me at the age of forty, a little bit June Cleaver, a little bit Mary Tyler Moore. On my better days, I gave myself credit for making it happen. The balance of my life was elegant only from a distance, and only if you squinted, but there was at least something there that resembled balance. The hospital job had turned out to be a good one, challenging and satisfying and in line with my beliefs. It astonished me, actually, to see how a big esteemed institution like a university medical center with ninety-five hundred employees traditionally operated, run primarily by academics who did medical research and wrote papers and who also, in general, seemed to find the neighborhood around them so scary that they wouldn't even cross an off-campus street. For me, that fear was galvanizing. It got me out of bed in the morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd spent most of my life living alongside those barriers -- noting the nervousness of white people in my neighborhood, registering all the subtle ways people with any sort of influence seemed to gravitate away from my home community and into clusters of affluence that seemed increasingly far removed. Here was an invitation to undo some of that, to knock down barriers where I could -- mostly by encouraging people to get to know one another. I was well supported by my new boss, given the freedom to build my own program, creating a stronger relationship between the hospital and its neighboring community. I started with one person working for me but eventually led a team of twenty-two. I instituted programs to take hospital staff and trustees out into neighborhoods around the South Side, having them visit community centers and schools, signing them up to be tutors, mentors, and science-fair judges, getting them to try the local barbecue joints. We brought local kids in to job shadow hospital employees, set up a program to increase the number of neighborhood people volunteering in the hospital, and worked with a summer academic institute through the medical school, encouraging students in the community to consider medicine as a career. After realizing that the hospital system could be better about hiring minority- and women-owned businesses for its contracted work, I helped set up the Office of Business Diversity as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我人生的大部分时间都在与这种隔阂为伴—我注意到居住在我们社区的白人的紧张，注意到有影响力的人似乎都在绕开我们的社区，去往更富足的地方，差距变得越来越大。我有机会消除一些隔阂，通过鼓励人们更好地了解彼此，在我能力所及的地方消除屏障。这个想法得到了我的新老板的大力支持，我可以按照自己的想法制订计划，在医院和附近的社区之间建立更强的联系。起初我只有一个下属，最后有了一个二十二人的团队。我采取的行动是将医院员工和理事带到南城各处的社区里，访问社区中心和学校，让他们注册成为助教、导师和科学博览会的裁判，品尝当地的烧烤摊。我们把社区的孩子带到医院跟着员工实习，增加医院里社区志愿者的数量，通过医学院和一个暑期学术机构合作，鼓励社区的学生未来考虑学医。在发现选择少数族裔和女性经营者作为外包业务的合作伙伴有助于改善医院的体系后，我还协助成立了商业多样性办公室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, there was the issue of people desperately needing care. The South Side had just over a million residents and a dearth of medical providers, not to mention a population that was disproportionately affected by the kinds of chronic conditions that tend to afflict the poor -- asthma, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease. With huge numbers of people uninsured and many others dependent on Medicaid, patients regularly jammed the university hospital's emergency room, often seeking what amounted to routine nonemergency treatment or having gone so long without preventive care that they were now in dire need of help. The problem was glaring, expensive, inefficient, and stressful for everyone involved. ER visits did little to improve anyone's long-term health, either. Trying to address this problem became an important focus for me. Among other things, we began hiring and training patient advocates -- friendly, helpful local people, generally -- who could sit with patients in the ER, helping them set up follow-up appointments at community health centers and educating them on where they could go to get decent and affordable regular care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，还要解决急需治疗的病人的问题。南城有一百多万居民，医疗机构却极为稀缺，而这些人中有相当大的比例容易患上穷人易得的慢性病，比如哮喘、糖尿病、高血压和心脏病。大多数人都没有上保险，还有很多人依赖医疗补助保险 [4]，病人常挤在医学中心的急诊室，要么经诊断发现是常见病，要么因为没有及时治疗致使需要急救。对所涉及的所有人而言，这个问题显而易见，代价高、效率低、压力大。况且，看急诊不会改善人们的长期健康状况。努力解决这一问题成为我的一项重要任务。我们采取的一个措施是：招聘和培训导医人员（通常是友好而乐于助人的本地人），他们可以陪急诊室的病人坐下来，帮助他们做好在社区卫生中心后续的预约，告诉他们可以去哪里接受质优价廉的日常护理。【注：[4]医疗补助保险（Medicaid），由联邦政府和州政府合作为低收入者提供医疗服务的保险。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My work was interesting and rewarding, but still I had to be careful not to let it consume me. I felt I owed that to my girls. Our decision to let Barack's career proceed as it had -- to give him the freedom to shape and pursue his dreams -- led me to tamp down my own efforts at work. Almost deliberately, I'd numbed myself somewhat to my ambition, stepping back in moments when I'd normally step forward. I'm not sure anyone around me would have said I wasn't doing enough, but I was always aware of everything I could have followed through on and didn't. There were certain small-scale projects I chose not to take on. There were young employees whom I could have mentored better than I did. You hear all the time about the trade-offs of being a working mother. These were mine. If I'd once been someone who threw herself completely into every task, I was now more cautious, protective of my time, knowing I had to maintain enough energy for life at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的工作很有趣，也让我很有成就感，但是我要当心它把我的精力消耗殆尽。我需要为女儿们留出精力。我们决定让贝拉克继续干他的事业—给他自由，让他追寻梦想，这就意味着我必须在自己的工作上有所保留。我刻意收敛自己的雄心壮志，在通常需要向前一步的时候，转而选择后退一步。我相信我身边的人不会说我做得不够，但是我自己清楚有哪些事情本可以进行到底我却选择了放弃。有些小型项目我没有跟进；有些年轻的员工，我其实可以带得更好。人们总说全职工作的妈妈要做出妥协，这些就是我的妥协。如果说，我曾经是一个全身心投入到每一项工作中的人，那么，现在我要更加谨慎，保护好我的时间，因为我需要为家庭生活保留足够的精力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My goals mostly involved maintaining normalcy and stability, but those would never be Barack's. We'd grown better about recognizing this and letting it be. One yin, one yang. I craved routine and order, and he did not. He could live in the ocean; I needed the boat. When he was present at home, he was at least impressively present, playing on the floor with the girls, reading Harry Potter out loud with Malia at night, laughing at my jokes and hugging me, reminding us of his love and steadiness before vanishing again for another half a week or more. We made the most of the gaps in his schedule, having meals and seeing friends. He indulged me (sometimes) by watching Sex and the City. I indulged him (sometimes) by watching The Sopranos. I'd given myself over to the idea that being away was just part of his job. I didn't like it, but for the most part I'd stopped fighting it. Barack could happily end a day in a faraway hotel with all sorts of political battles brewing and loose ends floating. I, meanwhile, lived for the shelter of home -- for the sense of completeness I felt each night with Sasha and Malia tucked into their beds and the dishwasher humming in the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的主要目标是维持家庭正常而稳定地运转，但这永远不是贝拉克的目标。我们已经清楚地认识到并接受了这一点。我们俩一阴一阳。我渴望规律和秩序，而他不。他可以在海洋里生活，而我需要一条船。他在家的时候存在感很强，和女儿们在地板上玩儿，晚上和玛利亚一起大声朗读《哈利·波特》，听我讲完笑话后哈哈大笑，拥抱我，而在我们感受到他的爱和存在后，他又会消失半个星期或者更长时间。他不在的时候，我们会出去吃饭，和朋友见面。他有时会迁就我看《欲望都市》，我有时会迁就他看《黑道家族》。我已经完全接受了一点—离开我们是他工作的一部分。我并不喜欢这样，但是我基本可以做到不抗拒。贝拉克可以在一个遥远的宾馆高高兴兴地结束一天的工作，其中蕴藏了各种各样的政治争斗，还有一堆未了结的事情。同时，我在为了家庭而生活—每晚哄萨沙和玛利亚睡觉，听着厨房的洗碗机嗡嗡作响，我内心都会有一种完整感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Valerie lived in a high-rise not far from us in Hyde Park. Her condo was clean and modern, with white walls and white furniture and sprays of exquisite bright orchids adding color. At the time, she was the executive vice president at a real-estate firm and a trustee at the University of Chicago Medical Center. She'd supported my efforts at Public Allies when I was there and helped raise funds for Barack's various campaigns, marshaling her wide network of connections to boost our every endeavor. Because of this, and because of her warm, wise demeanor, Valerie had come to occupy a curious position in our lives. Our friendship was equally personal and professional. And she was equally my friend and Barack's, which in my experience is a rare thing inside a couple. I had my high-powered mom posse, and Barack spent what little leisure time he had playing basketball with a group of buddies. We had some great friends who were couples, their children friends with our children, families we liked to vacation with. But Valerie was something different, a big sister to each of us individually and someone who helped us stand back and take measure of our dilemmas when they arose. She saw us clearly, saw our goals clearly, and was protective of us both.</div>

<div class="line_en">This Senate race presented a unique opportunity, Barack explained that day. He felt he had a real shot. The incumbent, Peter Fitzgerald, was a conservative Republican in an increasingly Democratic state and was having trouble maintaining the support of his own party. It was likely that multiple candidates would run in the primary, which meant that Barack would only need to command a plurality of the vote to win the Democratic nomination. As for money, he assured me that he wouldn't need to touch our personal finances. When I asked how we'd afford living expenses if we were going to have homes in both D. C. and Chicago, he'd said, "Well, I'll write another book and it'll be a big book, one that makes money."</div>

<div class="line_en">On all other fronts, Barack's logic was dismayingly solid. I watched Valerie's face as he spoke, realizing that he was quickly racking up points with her, that he had an answer for every "but what about?" question we could throw his way. I knew he was making sense, even as I fought off the urge to tally up all the additional hours he'd spend away from us now, not to mention the specter of a move to D. C. Though we'd argued over the drain of his political career on our family for years now, I did love and trust Barack. He was already a man with two families, his attention divided between me and the girls and his 200,000 or so South Side constituents. Would sharing him with the state of Illinois really be all that different? I couldn't know one way or another, but I also couldn't bring myself to stand in the way of his aspiration, that thing always tugging at him to try for more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，从其他各方面来说，贝拉克的逻辑都讲得通，那很让人气馁。在他讲话时，我观察着瓦莱丽的表情，发现她很快就被说服了，而且贝拉克对于扔给他的每一个“但是…怎么办呢”的问题都对答如流。我知道他说得有道理，但我抑制自己不去计算他当时离开我们有多长时间，更不要提还有搬到华盛顿这个担忧。关于他的政治事业对我们家庭的消耗，虽然我们已经争论了很多年，但我确实深爱和信任贝拉克。他已经是一个有“两个家庭”的男人了，他的精力一半儿放在我和女儿们身上，一半儿放在他的二十万南城选民的身上。要换成和伊利诺伊州来分享他，情况会有很大不同吗？我不知道，但是我不能阻碍他实现抱负，正是它一直在促使他尝试更高的目标。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What came next for Barack, though, was a series of lucky twists. First, Peter Fitzgerald decided not to run for reelection, clearing the field for challengers and relative newcomers like my husband. Then, somewhat oddly, both the Democratic front-runner in the primary and the ensuing Republican nominee became embroiled in scandals involving their ex-wives. With just a few months remaining before the election, Barack didn't even have a Republican opponent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，贝拉克之后接二连三地交好运。首先，彼得·菲茨杰拉德决定不再争取连任，向挑战者包括我丈夫这样的新来者敞开了竞选的大门。后来，很奇怪的是，参加民主党初选的领先者以及共和党后来的提名人都卷入与他们前妻的丑闻中。所以在离选举还有几个月时，贝拉克连一个共和党的对手都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To be sure, he'd been running an excellent campaign, having learned plenty from his failed congressional run. He'd beaten out seven primary opponents and earned more than half the vote to win the nomination.

His overly verbose answers to questions at town-hall forums and campaign debates seemed only to drive home the point that he belonged on the Senate floor.

<div class="line_en">And yet, in his curious and roundabout way, he seemed destined for exactly this moment. I knew because I'd seen up close how his mind churned nonstop. Over years, I'd watched him inhale books, newspapers, and ideas, sparking to life anytime he spoke with someone who offered a shard of new experience or knowledge. He'd stowed every piece of it. What he was building, I see now, was a vision -- and not a small one, either. It was the very thing I'd had to create room for in our shared life, to coexist with, even if reluctantly. It aggravated me sometimes no end, but it was also what I could never disavow in Barack. He'd been working at this thing, quietly and meticulously, as long as I'd known him. And now maybe the size of the audience would finally match the scope of what he believed to be possible. He'd been ready for that call. All he had to do was speak.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd left the girls at home with my mother and flown to be with him in Boston for the speech, standing in the wings at the convention center as Barack stepped into the hot glare of the stage lights and into view of all those millions of people. He was a little nervous and so was I, though we were both determined not to show it. This was how Barack operated anyway. The more pressure he was under, the calmer he seemed to get. He'd written his remarks over the course of a couple of weeks, working on them in between Illinois senate votes. He memorized his words and rehearsed them carefully, to the point where he wouldn't actually need the teleprompter unless his nerves got triggered and his mind went blank. But that wasn't at all what happened. Barack looked out at the audience and into the TV cameras, and as if kick-starting some internal engine, he just smiled and began to roll.</div>

Earnestly and expertly, he cast himself not as an outsider but rather as a literal embodiment of the American story. He reminded the audience that a country couldn't be carved up simply into red and blue, that we were united by a common humanity, compelled to care for the whole of society. He called for hope over cynicism. He spoke with hope, projected hope, almost sang with it, really.</div>

Looking back, I think it was then that I quietly began to let go of the idea that there was any reversing his course, that he'd ever belong solely to me and the girls.

Cable pundits were dubbing him a "rock star" and an "overnight success," as if he hadn't spent years working up to that moment onstage, as if the speech had created him instead of the other way around. Still, the speech was the beginning of something new, not just for him, but for us, our whole family.

There'd been only a few of us attending that year, and after a quick introduction the politicians went one way, while spouses were ushered into another room. I'd come with questions, knowing that politicians and their families were expected to adhere to strict federal ethics policies dictating everything from whom they could receive gifts from to how they paid for travel to and from Washington.

<div class="line_en">My husband was a senator, but somehow people seemed to want to vault right over that. Instead, everyone was keen to know whether he would make a run for president in 2008. There was no shaking the question. Every reporter asked it. Nearly every person who approached him on the street asked it. My colleagues at the hospital would stand in my doorway and casually drop the question, probing for some bit of early news. Even Malia, who was six and a half on the day she put on a pink velvet dress and stood next to Barack as he was sworn in to the Senate by Dick Cheney, wanted to know. Unlike many of the others, though, our first grader was wise enough to sense how premature it all seemed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was with Malia on this matter. As a lifelong pragmatist, I would always counsel a slow approach, the methodical checking of boxes. I was a natural-born fan of the long and judicious wait. In this regard, I felt better anytime I heard Barack pushing back at his inquisitors with an aw-shucks kind of modesty, batting away questions about the presidency, saying that the only thing he was planning was to put his head down and work hard in the Senate. He often reminded people that he was just a low-ranking member of the minority party, a backbench player if there ever was one. And, he would sometimes add, he had two kids he needed to raise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hurricane Katrina blasted the Gulf Coast of the United States late in August 2005, overwhelming the levees in New Orleans, swamping low-lying regions, stranding people -- black people, mostly -- on the rooftops of their destroyed homes. The aftermath was horrific, with media reports showing hospitals without backup power, distraught families herded into the Superdome, emergency workers hamstrung by a lack of supplies. In the end, some eighteen hundred people died, and more than half a million others were displaced, a tragedy exacerbated by the ineptitude of the federal government's response. It was a wrenching exposure of our country's structural divides, most especially the intense, lopsided vulnerability of African Americans and poor people of all races when things got rough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="2005年8月末，飓风“卡特里娜”袭击了美国的墨西哥湾地区，新奥尔良市的防洪堤决堤，人们—大部分是黑人—被困在他们被毁坏的房屋的屋顶上。那场天灾的影响是巨大的，据媒体报道，大批医院停电，悲痛欲绝的人们被带进阿斯托洛圆顶体育场，救援人员因为缺乏物资而束手无策。最终，飓风造成了一千八百多人死亡，五十多万人无家可归，联邦政府救灾不力对那场悲剧来说更是雪上加霜。这也令人痛心地看到了我们国家人口结构的弊端，特别是非洲裔美国人和各族裔的穷人的脆弱处境，在困境面前，他们往往是最无助、最容易受到伤害的群体。">查看中文翻译</div>

Barack was writing what would become The Audacity of Hope -- thinking through his beliefs and his vision for the country, threshing them into words on his legal pads late at night. He really was content, he told me, to stay where he was, building his influence over time, awaiting his turn to speak inside the deliberative cacophony of the Senate, but then a storm arrived.</div>

<div class="line_en">I watched the Katrina coverage with a knot in my stomach, knowing that if a disaster hit Chicago, many of my aunts and uncles, cousins and neighbors, would have suffered a similar fate. Barack's reaction was no less emotional. A week after the hurricane, he flew to Houston to join former president George H. W. Bush, along with Bill and Hillary Clinton, who was then a colleague of his in the Senate, spending time with the tens of thousands of New Orleans evacuees who'd sought shelter in the Astrodome there. The experience kindled something in him, that nagging sense he wasn't yet doing enough.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the thought I returned to a year or so later, when the drumbeat truly got loud, when the pressure on both of us felt immense. We went about our regular business, but the question of whether Barack would run for president unsettled the air around us. Could he? Will he? Should he? In the summer of 2006, poll respondents filling out open-ended questionnaires were naming him as a presidential possibility, though Hillary Clinton was decidedly the number one pick. By fall, though, Barack's stock had begun to rise in part thanks to the publication of The Audacity of Hope and a slew of media opportunities afforded by the book tour. His poll numbers were suddenly even with or ahead of those of Al Gore and John Kerry, the Democrats' previous two nominees -- evidence of his potential. I was aware that he'd been having private conversations with friends, advisers, and prospective donors, signaling to everyone that he was mulling over the idea. But there was one conversation he avoided having, and that was with me.</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew, of course, how I felt. We'd discussed it obliquely, around the edges of other topics. We'd lived with other people's expectations so long that they were almost embedded in every conversation we had. Barack's potential sat with our family at the dinner table. Barack's potential rode along to school with the girls and to work with me. It was there even when we didn't want it to be there, adding a strange energy to everything. From my point of view, my husband was doing plenty already. If he was going to even think about running for president, I hoped he'd take the prudent path, preparing slowly, biding his time in the Senate, and waiting until the girls were older -- until 2016, maybe.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was a senator's wife, but beyond that, and more important, I had a career that mattered to me. Back in the spring, I'd been promoted to become a vice president at the University of Chicago Medical Center. I'd spent the past couple of years leading the development of a program called the South Side Healthcare Collaborative, which had already connected more than fifteen hundred patients who'd turned up in our Emergency Department with care providers they could see regularly, regardless of whether they could pay or not. My work felt personal. I saw black folks streaming into the ER with issues that had long been neglected -- diabetic patients whose circulation issues had gone untended and who now needed a leg amputated, for example -- and couldn't help but think of every medical appointment my own father had failed to make for himself, every symptom of his MS he'd downplayed in order not to make a fuss, or cost anyone money, or generate paperwork, or to spare himself the feeling of being belittled by a wealthy white doctor.</div>

We lived in a nice house now, a Georgian brick home on a quiet street in the Kenwood neighborhood, with a wide porch and tall trees in the yard -- exactly the kind of place Craig and I used to gape at during Sunday drives in my dad's Buick. I thought often of my father and all he'd invested in us. I wished desperately for him to be alive, to see how things were playing out. Craig was profoundly happy now, having finally made a swerve, leaving his career in investment banking and pivoting back to his first love -- basketball. After a few years as an assistant at Northwestern, he was now head coach at Brown University in Rhode Island, and he was getting married again, to Kelly McCrum, a beautiful, down-to-earth college dean of admissions from the East Coast.

<div class="line_en">I liked my job, and while it wasn't perfect, I also liked my life. With Sasha about to move into elementary school, I felt as though I was at the start of a new phase, on the brink of being able to fire up my ambition again and consider a new set of goals. What would a presidential campaign do? It would hijack all that. I knew enough to understand this ahead of time. Barack and I had been through five campaigns in eleven years already, and each one had forced me to fight a bit harder to hang on to my own priorities. Each one had put a little dent in my soul and also in our marriage. A presidential run, I feared, would really bang us up. Barack would be gone far more than he was while serving in Springfield or Washington -- not for half weeks, but full weeks; not for four- to eight-week stretches with recesses in between, but for months at a time. What would that do to our family? What would the publicity do to our girls?</div>

He was recognized nearly everywhere he went now, but I still had the blessing of invisibility.

But they'd also made clear that there was no half doing a presidential campaign. Barack and I both would need to be fully on board. The demands on him would be unimaginable. Without missing a beat in his Senate duties, he'd have to build and maintain a coast-to-coast campaign operation, develop a policy platform, and also raise an astonishing amount of money. My job would be not just to give tacit support to the campaign but to participate in it.

What was our limit? What would be left in the end? The uncertainty alone felt like a threat, a thing that could drown us. I'd been raised, after all, in a family that believed in forethought -- that ran fire drills at home and showed up early to everything. Growing up in a working-class community and with a disabled parent, I'd learned that planning and vigilance mattered a lot. It could mean the difference between stability and poverty.

Barack and I talked the idea through, not once, but many times, right up to and through our Christmas trip to visit Toot in Hawaii. Some of our conversations were angry and tearful, some of them earnest and positive. It was the extension of a dialogue we'd been having over seventeen years already. Who were we? What mattered to us? What could we do?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道自己没有选择，只能接受，那就索性打开门把这种可能性迎进来。贝拉克和我把这件事聊得很透，聊了不止一次，而是很多次，一直到圣诞节我们去夏威夷看望外祖母的旅行结束。有些谈话是怒气冲天、泪水涟涟的，有些是郑重而积极的。那是我们十七年来一直在进行的一个对话的延伸。我们是谁？什么对我们重要？我们能做什么？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end, it boiled down to this: I said yes because I believed that Barack could be a great president. He was self-assured in ways that few people are. He had the intellect and discipline to do the job, the temperament to endure everything that would make it hard, and the rare degree of empathy that would keep him tuned carefully to the country's needs. He was also surrounded by good, smart people who were ready to help. Who was I to stop him? How could I put my own needs, and even those of our girls, in front of the possibility that Barack could be the kind of president who helped make life better for millions of people?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终的结果是：我同意了，因为我相信贝拉克会是一个好总统。他有无可匹敌的自信，有做这份工作的头脑和自律意识，有能够承受住所有困难的秉性，以及少见的高度同理心，这让他能够认真踏实地照顾国民的需求。而且他的身边围绕着一群善良而聪明的热心支持者。我凭什么去阻止他？我怎么能把自己的需求，甚至是女儿的需求放在第一位，而无视贝拉克成为那种帮助无数人的生活变得更好的总统的可能性？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I said yes, though I was at the same time harboring a painful thought, one I wasn't ready to share: I supported him in campaigning, but I also felt certain he wouldn't make it all the way. He spoke so often and so passionately of healing our country's divisions, appealing to a set of higher ideals he believed were innate in most people. But I'd seen enough of the divisions to temper my own hopes. Barack was a black man in America, after all. I didn't really think he could win.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我同意了，但是我心里有一个痛苦的想法，一个我不愿意说出来的想法：我支持他竞选，但是我也很确定他不会走到最后。他频繁而充满激情地谈到要弥合我们国家的分歧，希望唤起一些更高的理想，他相信这些理想是存在于大多数人心中的。但是这种分歧我见得太多了，早就降低了自己的期望值。毕竟，贝拉克是美国的一个黑人，我真的不认为他会赢。">查看中文翻译</div>
