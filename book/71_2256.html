<div class="line_en">"Upon my soul, gentlemen," the count said, motioning the two young men to sit down on a divan, "it is only because of that idiot Pastrini that I did not come to your rescue earlier! He told me nothing of your difficulty, even though he must have known that I, alone as I am here, wanted nothing better than to make the acquaintance of my neighbours. As soon as I knew that I could be of service to you, you can see how eagerly I grasped the opportunity to present my compliments."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的”伯爵一面回答，一面请两个青年就座“这都是那个糊涂的派里尼不好，以致我不能早些帮助你们解决困难。他没有对我提到你们的窘况，我，我很孤单寂寞，很想找一个机会来认识认识我的邻居。我一听到可以帮助你们一下，我就赶紧抓住这个可以效劳的机会”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Franz and I must thank you a thousand times, Count," said Albert. "You have truly spared us a great deal of irritation: we were inventing the most fantastic sorts of conveyance when we received your most kind invitation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“弗兰士和我对您万分感谢，伯爵阁下”阿尔培答道“我们正在左右为难，大伤脑筋的时候，您给我们解了围，我们接到您那恳切的邀请的时候，正在发明一种异想天开的车子呢”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two young men bowed. Franz had not yet said a word; he had not been able to make up his mind and, since nothing indicated that the count either wished to recognize him or to be recognized by him, he did not know whether he should make any allusion to the past or leave time in the future for something new to arise. Moreover, while he was sure that it was the count who had been in the theatre on the previous evening, he could not be so sure that it was also the same person who had been in the Colosseum on the evening before, so he decided to let events take their course without himself making any direct reference to what had occurred. In addition, this gave him an advantage over the count, being the master of his secret, while he could have no hold over Franz, who had nothing to hide. However, he decided to lead the conversation towards a point which might, meanwhile, confirm a few of his suspicions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个青年鞠了一躬。弗兰士还没有想到该说什么话，他还没有确定如何行动，伯爵的态度上毫无表示愿意承认他们已曾相识，他不知道究竟是提起过去的事情好，还是看看风色再定。而且，虽然他确实就是昨天晚上对面包厢里的那个人，但却不能肯定他就是斗兽场的那个人。所以他决定让事情自然发展，而不向伯爵作任何正面的提议。再说，他现在比他占优势——他已经掌握了他的秘密，而他却没有捉到弗兰士什么东西，因为弗兰士根本没有什么须要掩饰的事情。但是，他决心要把谈话引到一个或许可以弄清他的疑虑的题目上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gentlemen," said the Count of Monte Cristo as he came in, "I apologize for allowing you to anticipate my call, but I was afraid that it might have been indiscreet of me to visit you any earlier than this. In any case, you informed me that you would come, so I have kept myself at your disposal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“二位”基督山伯爵一面进来，一面说“请原谅我没有先登门拜谒，但我恐怕去得太早，有扰清神。而且，你们已传话给我，说你们愿意先来看我，所以我也就恭敬不如从命了”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, this is what was originally intended, but I think that since yesterday there has been a change in the order and conduct of the ceremony."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“真的！”弗兰士说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No…" the count replied casually. "To the other…" (he looked at the notebook as if to remind himself of the name) "… to Peppino, alias Rocca Priori. That means you will be denied a guillotining, but you still have the mazzolata, which is a very curious form of torture when you see it for the first time -- or even the second; while the other, which in any case you must know, is too simple, too unvaried. There is nothing unexpected in it. The mandaïa makes no mistakes, its hand doesn't shake, it doesn't miss and it doesn't make thirty attempts before succeeding, like the soldier who beheaded the Comte de Chalais and who had perhaps been particularly chosen for this victim by Richelieu. Ah, come now," said the count in a scornful tone, "don't talk to me about Europeans where torture is concerned. They understand nothing about it. With them, cruelty is in its infancy -- or perhaps its old age."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”伯爵随随便便地说，“是另外那一个，”他向传单瞟了一眼，象是已记不得那个人的名字似的，“是庇庇诺，即罗卡·庇奥立。所以你们看不到一个人上断头台了，但锤刑还是有的，那种刑法你们初次看的时候会觉得非常奇特，甚至第二次看都不免有这种感觉，至于斩刑，你们一定知道，是很简单的。那断头机是决不会失灵，决不会颤抖，也决不会象杀夏莱①伯爵的那个兵那样连着砍三十次。红衣主教黎希留②无疑的是为了看到夏莱伯爵被杀头的那种惨景，动了恻隐之心，才改良刑法的。啊！”伯爵用一种轻视的口吻继续说，“别向我谈起欧洲的刑法，以残酷而论，与其说还在婴儿时代，倒不如说，简直已到了暮年啦。”【注：①夏莱（1599－1626），路易十三的宠臣，因反对黎希留被斩首。②黎希留（1585－1642），法国十七世纪时的红衣主教，法国国王路易十三（1610－1643）的大臣。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Truly, Monsieur le Comte," said Franz, "anyone would think you had made a comparative study of executions in different parts of the world."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我最初觉得恐怖，后来就麻木了，最后觉得好奇。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why? There is only one serious matter to be considered in life, and that is death. So! Isn't it worth one's curiosity to study the different ways that the soul may leave the body and how, according to the character, the temperament, or even the local customs of a country, individuals face up to that supreme journey from being to nothingness? As for me, I can assure you of one thing: the more you have seen others die, the easier it becomes to die oneself. So, in my opinion, death may be a torment, but it is not an expiation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？在一生中，我们所最担心的是死。那末，来研究灵魂和肉体分离的各种方法，并根据各人不同的个性，不同的气质，甚至各国不同的风俗，来测定从生到死，从存在到消灭这个转变过程上每一个人所能忍受的限度，这难道算是好奇吗？至于我，我可以向你们保证一件事——你愈多看见人死，你死的时候就愈容易。照我看，死或许是一种刑罚，但并不就等于赎罪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Listen," said the count, his face flushing with the gall of hatred as another face might be coloured with blood. "If a man had murdered your father, your mother, your mistress, or any of those beings who, when they are torn from your heart, leave an eternal void and a wound that can never be staunched, and if he had subjected them to unspeakable torture and endless torment, would you consider that society had accorded you sufficient reparation just because the blade of the guillotine had travelled between the base of the murderer's occipital and his trapezius muscles, and because the person who had caused you to feel years of moral suffering had experienced a few seconds of physical pain?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”伯爵说，他的脸上流露出深切的仇恨，要是换了别人，这时一定会涨得满脸通红。“要是一个人用了闻所未闻，最残酷，最痛苦的方法摧毁了你的父亲，你的母亲，你的爱人——总之，夺去了你最心爱的人，在你的胸膛上留下一个永远无法合口的创伤，而社会所给你的补偿，只是用断头机上的刀在那个凶手的脖子上割一下，让那个使你精神上苦恼了许多年的人只受几秒钟肉体上的痛苦，你觉得那种补偿够不够？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know," Franz said. "Human justice is inadequate as a consolation: it can spill blood for blood, that's all. But one must only ask it for what is possible, not for anything more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我知道，”弗兰士说，“人类的正义①是不够使我们得到慰藉的，她只能以血还血，如此而已，但你也只能向她提出要求，而且只能在她力所能及的范围以内要求呀。”【注：①指法律。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Moreover, the example that I give you is a material one," the count went on; "one where society, attacked by the death of an individual among the mass of individuals which composes it, avenges that death by another. But are there not millions of sufferings which can rend the entrails of a man without society taking the slightest heed of them or providing even the inadequate means of reparation that we spoke of just now? Are there not crimes for which impalement à la turque, or Persian burial alive, or the whips of the Iraqis would be too mild a torment, but which society in its indifference leaves unpunished? Answer me: are there no such crimes?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我再举一个例子给你听，”伯爵继续说，“社会上，每当一个人受到死亡的攻击时，社会就以死来报复死。但是，难道不是有人受到千百种惨刑，而社会对这些连知道也不知道，甚至连我们刚才所说的那种不足补偿的报复方式也不提供给他吗？有几种罪恶，即使用土耳其人的刺刑，波斯人的钻刑，印第安人的炮烙和火印也嫌惩罚得不够的，而社会不是却不闻不见，丝毫未加以惩罚吗？请回答我，这些罪恶不是存在的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, duelling!" exclaimed the count. "There's a fine way, I must say, to achieve one's end, when the end is vengeance! A man has stolen your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonoured your daughter. He has taken an entire life, a life that had the right to expect from God the share of happiness that He promises to every human being in creating us, and turned it into a mere existence of pain, misery and infamy; and you consider yourself revenged because you have run this man through with your sword or put a bullet in his head, after he has turned your mind to delirium and your heart to despair? Come, come! Even without considering that he is often the one who comes out of this contest on top, purged in the eyes of the world and in some respect pardoned by God… No, no," the count went on, "if I ever had to take my revenge, that is not how I should do it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呀，决斗！”伯爵喊道，“凭良心说，当你的目的是报复时，用这种方法来达到你的目的未免太轻松啦！一个人抢去你的爱人，一个人淫了你的妻子，一个人沾污了你的女儿，你本来有权利可以向上天要求幸福的，因为上帝创造了人，允许人人都可得到幸福，而他却破坏了你的一生，使你终生痛苦蒙羞。他使你的脑子疯狂，让你的心里绝望，而你，只因为你已经把一颗子弹射进他的脑袋，或用一把剑刺穿他的胸，就自以为已经报了仇了——却想不到，决斗之后，胜利者却往往是他，因为在全世界人的眼里，他已是清白的了，在上帝心里，已是抵罪的了！不，不，”伯爵继续说，“要是我为自己复仇，就不会这样去报复。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," Franz replied. "It is precisely to punish them that we tolerate duelling."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, certainly!" said the count. "Make no mistake: I should fight a duel for a trifle, an insult, a contradiction, a slap -- and all the more merrily for knowing that, thanks to the skill I have acquired in all physical exercises and long experience of danger, I should be more or less certain of killing my opponent. Oh, yes, indeed! I should fight a duel for any of these things; but in return for a slow, deep, infinite, eternal pain, I should return as nearly as possible a pain equivalent to the one inflicted on me. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as they say in the East, those men who are the elect of creation, and who have learnt to make a life of dreams and a paradise of reality."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，斗的！”伯爵答道，“请了解我，我会为一件小事决斗，譬如说，为了一次侮辱，为了一记耳光，而且很愿意决斗，因为，凭我在各种体格训练上所获得的技巧和我逐渐养成的漠视危险的习惯，我敢肯定一定可以杀死我的敌手。噢，为了这样的原因我是会决斗的。但要报复一种迟缓的，深切的，永恒的痛苦，假如可能的话，我却要以同样的痛苦来回答：以眼还眼，以牙还牙，如东方人所说的那样——东方人在各方面都是我们的大师。那些得天独厚的人在梦中过活，因此倒给他们自己造成了一个现实的乐园。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, with such an outlook," Franz told the count, "which makes you judge and executioner in your own case, it would be hard for you to confine yourself to actions that would leave you forever immune to the power of the law. Hatred is blind and anger deaf: the one who pours himself a cup of vengeance is likely to drink a bitter draught."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，”弗兰士对伯爵说，“抱了这种理论，则等于你自己是原告，同时又做法官和刽子手，这是很难实行的，因为你得时时刻刻提防落到法律的手里。仇恨是盲目的，愤怒会使你失去理智，凡是倾泄复仇的苦酒的人，他自己也冒着危险，或许会尝到一种更苦的饮料。”">查看中文翻译</div>

In any case, if the worst comes to the worst, he can only suffer the ultimate penalty which we mentioned just now: the one that the philanthropic French Revolution put in place of quartering and the wheel. Well, then! What does the penalty matter if he is avenged? In truth, I am almost irritated at the fact that, quite probably, this miserable Peppino will not be decapitato, as they say; you'd see how long it takes, and whether it's really worth bothering about. But, gentlemen, this is indeed an odd topic of discussion for carnival time. How did we get round to it? Ah, yes, I remember! You asked for a seat at my window. Very well, yes, you shall have one.

<div class="line_en">During lunch, which was excellent and served with the greatest refinement, Franz tried to read in Albert's eyes the impression that he was sure their host's words would have left on him. But, whether it was that, with his habitual insouciance, he had not paid great attention to them, or that the Count of Monte Cristo's concession on the matter of duelling had reconciled him to the man, or finally that prior events which we have related, and which were known only to Franz, had doubled the effect that the count's theories had on him, he did not perceive that his friend was in the slightest concerned. On the contrary, he was paying the meal the compliment one would expect from a man who has been condemned for four or five months to suffer Italian cooking (which is among the worst in the world). As for the count, he barely touched each dish: one would think that courtesy alone had induced him to sit down with his guests and that he was waiting for them to leave, to have himself brought some rare or special delicacy.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come now, just because you have not done something in Paris, that is no reason for not doing it abroad. When one travels, one does so to learn: a change of place should mean a change of scenery. Imagine how you will look when people ask you: 'How do they execute criminals in Rome?' and you have to answer: 'I don't know.' Then, they say that the condemned man is an infamous rogue, a maniac who took a gridiron and beat to death a good priest who had brought him up as his own son. Just think! When you kill a man of the cloth, you should at least use a more appropriate implement than a gridiron, especially when this priest could be your father. If you were travelling through Spain, you would go and see a bullfight, wouldn't you? Well, imagine that we are going to see a fight; imagine the Ancient Romans and their Circus, those wild-beast hunts in which they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men. Remember the eighty thousand spectators clapping their hands, the virtuous matrons who would take their unmarried daughters, and those delightful Vestal Virgins whose pure white hands would give a charming little sign with the thumb that meant: 'Come on, don't be lazy! Finish him off, that man who is already three-quarters dead!'"</div>

<div class="line_en">A double row of carabinieri extended from each side of the church door to the scaffold, widening out on reaching it to leave a path some ten feet across and, around the guillotine, a clear space of some hundred yards in circumference. The whole of the rest of the square was carpeted with the heads of men and women. Many of the women had children seated on their shoulders. These children, who were a good head and shoulders above the rest of the crowd, would have an excellent view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教堂门口，每边都有一列双排的马枪兵，从门口直排到断头台前，并在断头台四周围成一个圆圈，留出一条约莫十呎宽的小径，在断头机周围，则留下一片将近一百呎的空地。其余一切地方都被男男女女的头填满了。许多女人把她们的小孩子掮在她们的肩头上，所以孩子们看得最清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Monte Pincio seemed like a huge amphitheatre with all of its terraces crowded with spectators. The balconies of the two churches at the corners of the Via del Babuino and the Via di Ripetta were overflowing with privileged onlookers. The steps of the peristyles had the appearance of swelling, many-coloured waves, driven towards the portico by the flow of an unceasing tide. Every protuberance on the wall capable of supporting a man had a living statue attached to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="平西奥山象是一家挤满了看客的露天大戏院。巴布诺街和立庇得街拐角上的两座教堂的阳台上挤得满满的。台阶上象是一股杂色斑驳的海流，向门廊下拚命的挤。墙上每一处凹进去的地方都拱着活的雕像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First to appear was a company of penitents, each of them dressed in a grey sack which covered him entirely except for the holes for the eyes, and each holding a lighted candle in his hand. At the front marched the head of the order.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最先出现的，是一小群苦修士，其中有一个领头走在前边；他们从头到脚都遮在一件灰色粗布的长袍里，只在眼睛的地方有两个洞，他们的手里都拿着点燃了的小蜡烛。教团的首领走在最前面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And yet, instead of the silence that the solemnity of the occasion would seem to demand, a great noise rose from the crowd, a noise made up of laughter, booing and joyful cries. It was clear, as the count had also said, that the execution was nothing more for the people than the start of carnival.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，虽然这一幕庄严的情景似乎应该令人肃静无哗，但人群里反而浮起一片很大的闹声——一片笑和欢呼所组成的闹声，显然在人们的眼中，这次杀人只是狂欢节的开幕典礼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="单单看到这一幕情景，弗兰士觉得他身下的那两条腿已在发抖了。他望望阿尔培；阿尔培的脸白得象他的衬衫一样，他机械地丢掉他的雪茄，虽然那支雪茄还不曾抽到一半。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only the count appeared impassive. More than that: a faint blush of red seemed to be appearing beneath the livid pallor of his cheeks. His nose was dilating like that of a wild beast at the smell of blood, and his lips, slightly parted, showed his white teeth, as small and sharp as a jackal's. Yet, despite that, his face had an expression of smiling tenderness that Franz had never before seen on it; his black eyes, above all, were compellingly soft and lenient.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有伯爵似乎无动于衷——不，他激动得很，一层浅红色似乎正在拚命地从他那苍白的面颊上透出来。他的鼻孔张得大大的，象是一只野兽嗅到了它的牺牲品似的。他的嘴巴半开着，露出他那雪白的，又细又尖，象狼一样的牙齿。可是，他的脸上却露出一种温柔的微笑，这种表情弗兰士以前是从来不曾在他的脸上看见过的，他那一对黑眼睛充满着慈悲和怜悯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the two condemned men continued to proceed towards the scaffold and, as they approached, one could make out their faces. Peppino was a handsome young man of between twenty-four and twenty-six, with a wild and free look on his sunburnt face. He carried his head high and seemed to be sniffing the wind to see from which direction his liberator would come.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just as Peppino reached the foot of the mandaïa, a penitent, who seemed like a late arrival, broke through the wall of soldiers without them attempting to stop him and, going up to the head of the order, gave him a sheet of paper folded in four. Peppino's sharp eyes had missed none of this. The head of the order unfolded the paper, read it and raised his hand. "The Lord be blessed and His Holiness be praised!" he said loudly and clearly.

<div class="line_en">"What is wrong?" the count repeated. "Don't you understand?

Oh men! Men! Race of crocodiles, as Karl Moor says," the count exclaimed, brandishing his two clenched fists towards the heads of the crowd.

<div class="line_en">"Look, look," the count continued, grasping each of the two young men by the hand. "Look, because I swear to you, this is worthy of your curiosity. Here is a man who was resigned to his fate, who was walking to the scaffold and about to die like a coward, that's true, but at least he was about to die without resisting and without recriminations. Do you know what gave him that much strength? Do you know what consoled him? Do you know what resigned him to his fate? It was the fact that another man would share his anguish, that another man was to die like him, that another man was to die before him! Put two sheep in the slaughter-house or two oxen in the abattoir and let one of them realize that his companion will not die, and the sheep will bleat with joy, the ox low with pleasure. But man, man whom God made in His image, man to whom God gave this first, this sole, this supreme law, that he should love his neighbour, man to whom God gave a voice to express his thoughts -- what is man's first cry when he learns that his neighbour is saved? A curse. All honour to man, the masterpiece of nature, the lord of creation!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The injunction was almost unnecessary. Franz was, as it were, mesmerized by the horrible scene. The two assistants had carried the condemned man on to the scaffold and there, despite his efforts, his bites and his cries, they had forced him to his knees. Meanwhile the executioner had taken up his position on one side and raised the mace. Then, on a sign, the two assistants stepped aside. The prisoner wanted to get to his feet but, before he had time to do so, the club struck him on the left temple. There was a dull, muffled sound, the victim fell like a stricken bull, face downwards, then on the rebound turned over on his back. At this the executioner dropped his mace, pulled the knife out of his belt, cut open his throat with a single stroke and, immediately stepping on his belly, began as it were to knead the body with his feet. At each stamping of the foot, a jet of blood spurted from the condemned man's neck.</div>
