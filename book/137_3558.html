<div class="line_en">On that night, accordingly, Quasimodo, after having cast a glance at his poor bells which he so neglected now, Jacqueline, Marie, and Thibauld, mounted to the summit of the Northern tower, and there setting his dark lanturn, well closed, upon the leads, he began to gaze at Paris. The night, as we have already said, was very dark. Paris which, so to speak was not lighted at that epoch, presented to the eye a confused collection of black masses, cut here and there by the whitish curve of the Seine. Quasimodo no longer saw any light with the exception of one window in a distant edifice, whose vague and sombre profile was outlined well above the roofs, in the direction of the Porte Sainte-Antoine. There also, there was some one awake.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, Quasimodo did not sleep. He had just made his last round of the church. He had not noticed, that at the moment when he was closing the doors, the archdeacon had passed close to him and betrayed some displeasure on seeing him bolting and barring with care the enormous iron locks which gave to their large leaves the solidity of a wall. Dom Claude's air was even more preoccupied than usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天夜里，卡席莫多没有睡觉。他刚刚在主教堂里最后巡视了一圈。他关上各道门户的时候，没有发现副主教擦着他身边走了过去。副主教看见他仔仔细细插闩上锁，一道道大铁门固若金汤，心中恼怒异常。堂克洛德这时的神情更比往常忧心忡忡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Moreover, since the nocturnal adventure in the cell, he had constantly abused Quasimodo, but in vain did he ill treat, and even beat him occasionally, nothing disturbed the submission, patience, the devoted resignation of the faithful bellringer. He endured everything on the part of the archdeacon, insults, threats, blows, without murmuring a complaint. At the most, he gazed uneasily after Dom Claude when the latter ascended the staircase of the tower; but the archdeacon had abstained from presenting himself again before the gypsy's eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从那天夜里摸进爱斯美腊达的卧室大触霉头，副主教就时常虐待卡席莫多，可是，不管他怎样对他粗暴，有时甚至打他，丝毫也不能动摇忠心耿耿敲钟人的顺从、忍耐和逆来顺受。来自副主教的一切，怒骂、威胁、拳打脚踢，他都受着，了无怨言，一句责难也没有。充其量，只是在堂克洛德登上钟楼楼梯的时候，他以惴惴不安的目光密切注视他的动向，不过，副主教倒是自动不再出现在埃及姑娘眼前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All at once, while he was scrutinizing the great city with that eye which nature, by a sort of compensation, had made so piercing that it could almost supply the other organs which Quasimodo lacked, it seemed to him that there was something singular about the Quay de la Vieille-Pelleterie, that there was a movement at that point, that the line of the parapet, standing out blackly against the whiteness of the water was not straight and tranquil, like that of the other quays, but that it undulated to the eye, like the waves of a river, or like the heads of a crowd in motion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那只独眼，造化似乎是为了补偿，赋予极其敏锐的视力，几乎可以代替卡席莫多所缺的一切其他器官。当他以这只独眼仔细察看全城的时候，忽然似乎发现老皮货坊那里堤岸的侧影呈现出异常情况，好像这个点上有了动静，堤岸衬托在白色水面上的那黑色剪影的线条不像其他地方那样平整而静止，看来是在波动，像是河水的波浪，又像是一群人走动时脑袋晃动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the only eye of the bellringer peered into that horizon of mist and night, he felt within him an inexpressible uneasiness. For several days he had been upon his guard. He had perceived men of sinister mien, who never took their eyes from the young girl's asylum, prowling constantly about the church. He fancied that some plot might be in process of formation against the unhappy refugee. He imagined that there existed a popular hatred against her, as against himself, and that it was very possible that something might happen soon. Hence he remained upon his tower on the watch, "dreaming in his dream-place," as Rabelais says, with his eye directed alternately on the cell and on Paris, keeping faithful guard, like a good dog, with a thousand suspicions in his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他那只独眼任意扫视夜雾迷蒙的天边，敲钟人感到内心里说不出来的不安。他像这样警戒着已经好几天了。他不断看见有人在教堂四周转悠，神情阴险，目不转睛地盯住吉卜赛姑娘的避难所。他想大概是在酝酿不利于不幸的避难姑娘的阴谋。他猜想，民众憎恨她，也憎恨他自己，十分可能马上就会大祸临头。因此，他守在钟楼上，保持警戒，如拉伯雷所说：“在梦境中徜徉”，一会看看姑娘的小室，一会眺望巴黎，以保万全，就像一只忠实的狗，心中却狐疑丛生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This struck him as strange. He redoubled his attention. The movement seemed to be advancing towards the City. There was no light. It lasted for some time on the quay; then it gradually ceased, as though that which was passing were entering the interior of the island; then it stopped altogether, and the line of the quay became straight and motionless again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他好生奇怪，加紧注意。那边的运动似乎是朝着内城方向。可是不见亮光。在堤岸上停了一会，然后从那里缓缓流逸，仿佛那运动的一群是在进入岛内，接着完全静止了，堤岸的轮廓又呈现平静而安静了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the moment when Quasimodo was lost in conjectures, it seemed to him that the movement had re-appeared in the Rue du Parvis, which is prolonged into the city perpendicularly to the façade of Notre-Dame. At length, dense as was the darkness, he beheld the head of a column debouch from that street, and in an instant a crowd -- of which nothing could be distinguished in the gloom except that it was a crowd -- spread over the Place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当卡席莫多力尽智穷猜测不透的时候，他发现这一群好像运动到圣母院前面那条向内城延伸而与主教堂正面垂直的街道（40）上来了。终于，虽然夜色浓黑，卡席莫多还是辨认出纵队的一个前列突入了这条街道，不一会，广场上就扩散开了一大堆东西，黑暗中看不清楚，只见黑糊糊的一大堆。【注：（40）即前庭街。今已不存在。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This spectacle had a terror of its own. It is probable that this singular procession, which seemed so desirous of concealing itself under profound darkness, maintained a silence no less profound. Nevertheless, some noise must have escaped it, were it only a trampling. But this noise did not even reach our deaf man, and this great multitude, of which he saw hardly anything, and of which he heard nothing, though it was marching and moving so near him, produced upon him the effect of a rabble of dead men, mute, impalpable, lost in a smoke. It seemed to him, that he beheld advancing towards him a fog of men, and that he saw shadows moving in the shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一景象确实恐怖吓人。这支奇异的行列似乎处心积虑在最黑的地方躲躲藏藏，同时也竭力保持最大的沉默。不过，多少总有点响声透露出来，纵然只是脚步嚓嚓的声音。然而，这么一点点声音甚至达不到聋子卡席莫多，就消失了。这庞大的一群，他几乎看不见，根本听不见，却紧紧在他下边蠕动行进，给予他的印象有如一大群死人，哑口无言，不可触摸，消融于烟雾之中。他好像看见向他迫近的是人影幢幢的一重迷雾，是一个个鬼影在黑暗中蠕动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then his fears returned to him, the idea of an attempt against the gypsy presented itself once more to his mind. He was conscious, in a confused way, that a violent crisis was approaching. At that critical moment he took counsel with himself, with better and prompter reasoning than one would have expected from so badly organized a brain. Ought he to awaken the gypsy? to make her escape? Whither? The streets were invested, the church backed on the river. No boat, no issue!-- There was but one thing to be done; to allow himself to be killed on the threshold of Notre-Dame, to resist at least until succor arrived, if it should arrive, and not to trouble la Esmeralda's sleep. This resolution once taken, he set to examining the enemy with more tranquillity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他原有的种种疑虑重新袭来，心里又想到会有人试图加害于埃及姑娘。他隐约感到临近紧急关头了。在这样的危急时刻，他在内心中自谋主张，推理健全而且敏捷，是我们对于他这样先天极不健全的头脑，想也不会想到的。是不是应该叫醒埃及姑娘？叫她逃走么？从哪儿逃？街道都给围上了，教堂陷于背水受敌的绝境。没有船，无路可逃。……只有一个办法，就是坚守圣母院而玉碎，至少抵抗到救兵来援——如果有救兵的话，而不要惊扰爱斯美腊达的睡梦。不幸的姑娘如果非死不可，任何时候醒都是来得及的。他下了这个决心之后，就开始泰然若定地察看“敌情”了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The throng seemed to increase every moment in the church square. Only, he presumed that it must be making very little noise, since the windows on the Place remained closed. All at once, a flame flashed up, and in an instant seven or eight lighted torches passed over the heads of the crowd, shaking their tufts of flame in the deep shade. Quasimodo then beheld distinctly surging in the Parvis a frightful herd of men and women in rags, armed with scythes, pikes, billhooks and partisans, whose thousand points glittered. Here and there black pitchforks formed horns to the hideous faces. He vaguely recalled this populace, and thought that he recognized all the heads who had saluted him as Pope of the Fools some months previously. One man who held a torch in one hand and a club in the other, mounted a stone post and seemed to be haranguing them. At the same time the strange army executed several evolutions, as though it were taking up its post around the church. Quasimodo picked up his lantern and descended to the platform between the towers, in order to get a nearer view, and to spy out a means of defence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前庭广场上的人群似乎越集越多了。只是，卡席莫多推断，他们一定是尽量不发出声响，因为广场四周人家的窗子始终没有打开。倏然，一下闪亮，霎时间七、八支火把在人群上空游荡，在黑暗中晃动着一簇簇火焰。于是，卡席莫多清清楚楚地看见下面男男女女多得可怕，全是破衣烂衫，手执镰刀、戈矛、大镰、钩镰枪，数不清的刃尖闪闪发光。随处都有黑黝黝的钢叉高举，他们的丑恶的脸上因而就好像长出了角一般。他模模糊糊地还记得这些人，好像认得出几个月前曾经拥戴他为丑王的所有那些面孔。有个人一手举着火把，一手拿着布拉伊，登上一块界碑，好像在发表演说。与此同时，这支奇异的军队作出几次运动，好像是环绕着主教堂占领了阵地。卡席莫多拾起灯笼，下去，到了两座钟楼之间的平台上，便于仔细观察并设想防御的办法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clopin Trouillefou, on arriving in front of the lofty portal of Notre-Dame had, in fact, ranged his troops in order of battle. Although he expected no resistance, he wished, like a prudent general, to preserve an order which would permit him to face, at need, a sudden attack of the watch or the police. He had accordingly stationed his brigade in such a manner that, viewed from above and from a distance, one would have pronounced it the Roman triangle of the battle of Ecnomus, the boar's head of Alexander or the famous wedge of Gustavus Adolphus. The base of this triangle rested on the back of the Place in such a manner as to bar the entrance of the Rue du Parvis; one of its sides faced Hôtel-Dieu, the other the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs. Clopin Trouillefou had placed himself at the apex with the Duke of Egypt, our friend Jehan, and the most daring of the scavengers.</div>

<div class="line_en">An enterprise like that which the vagabonds were now undertaking against Notre-Dame was not a very rare thing in the cities of the Middle Ages. What we now call the "police" did not exist then. In populous cities, especially in capitals, there existed no single, central, regulating power. Feudalism had constructed these great communities in a singular manner. A city was an assembly of a thousand seigneuries, which divided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes. Hence, a thousand conflicting establishments of police; that is to say, no police at all. In Paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty-one lords who laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to a manor and to administering justice, from the Bishop of Paris, who had five hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre-Dame des Champs, who had four. All these feudal justices recognized the suzerain authority of the king only in name. All possessed the right of control over the roads. All were at home. Louis XI., that indefatigable worker, who so largely began the demolition of the feudal edifice, continued by Richelieu and Louis XIV. for the profit of royalty, and finished by Mirabeau for the benefit of the people,-- Louis XI. had certainly made an effort to break this network of seignories which covered Paris, by throwing violently across them all two or three troops of general police. Thus, in 1465, an order to the inhabitants to light candles in their windows at nightfall, and to shut up their dogs under penalty of death; in the same year, an order to close the streets in the evening with iron chains, and a prohibition to wear daggers or weapons of offence in the streets at night. But in a very short time, all these efforts at communal legislation fell into abeyance. The bourgeois permitted the wind to blow out their candles in the windows, and their dogs to stray; the iron chains were stretched only in a state of siege; the prohibition to wear daggers wrought no other changes than from the name of the Rue Coupe-Gueule to the name of the Rue-Coupe-Gorge which is an evident progress. The old scaffolding of feudal jurisdictions remained standing; an immense aggregation of bailiwicks and seignories crossing each other all over the city, interfering with each other, entangled in one another, enmeshing each other, trespassing on each other; a useless thicket of watches, sub-watches and counter-watches, over which, with armed force, passed brigandage, rapine, and sedition. Hence, in this disorder, deeds of violence on the part of the populace directed against a palace, a hotel, or house in the most thickly populated quarters, were not unheard-of occurrences. In the majority of such cases, the neighbors did not meddle with the matter unless the pillaging extended to themselves. They stopped up their ears to the musket shots, closed their shutters, barricaded their doors, allowed the matter to be concluded with or without the watch, and the next day it was said in Paris, "Etienne Barbette was broken open last night. The Marshal de Clermont was seized last night, etc." Hence, not only the royal habitations, the Louvre, the Palace, the Bastille, the Tournelles, but simply seignorial residences, the Petit-Bourbon, the Hôtel de Sens, the Hôtel d' Angoulême, etc., had battlements on their walls, and machicolations over their doors. Churches were guarded by their sanctity. Some, among the number Notre-Dame, were fortified. The Abbey of Saint-German-des-Pres was castellated like a baronial mansion, and more brass expended about it in bombards than in bells. Its fortress was still to be seen in 1610. To-day, barely its church remains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="类似无赖汉此刻试图攻打圣母院的壮举，在中世纪的城市并不是希罕少见之事。今日所称的“治安”当时是没有的。在人口众多的城市，尤其是各国首都，并不存在统一的起枢纽作用的中央政权。由于封建制度，这些大市镇的结构式样十分古怪。一座城市就是成千上万领主采邑的集合体，把城市分割为形形色色、大小不一的孤立藩地。因而治安制度彼此矛盾，也就谈不上治安。例如巴黎，除了一百四十一名领主自称有权收年贡以外，还有二十五名自称有司法权、也有权收年贡，其中大至拥有一百零五条街道的巴黎主教，小至只有四条街道的田园圣母院院长。所有这些封建司法大权在握者，对于国王只在名义上承认其君主权。全都有征收通行税权。个个都自行其是。路易十一坚持不懈，广泛开始了拆除封建大厦的工作，以后由黎希留和路易十四继续下去以有利于王权，最后由米拉博完成以有利于人民。路易十一竭尽努力予以打乱，采取激烈措施，连下两三道谕旨，推行统一治安，试行密布巴黎的这封建领主网（43）。因此，在一四六五年，命令居民入夜之后必须点燃蜡烛照亮窗户并把狗关起来，违者处绞刑；同年，又命令夜间用铁索封锁街道并禁止夜间携带短刀或其他进攻性武器上街。然而，不多久，所有这些市镇立法的尝试也都废弃了。市民们听任风吹熄窗口的蜡烛，他们的狗到处游荡，铁索只在戒严时拉起来；禁止携带武器没有带来什么变化，只是把割咽街改名为割喉街，——固然这算是个明显的进步。古老的封建裁判结构保持不变；这种典吏制度和封建领主制度的庞大堆积，交错重压着城市，互相妨碍，彼此纠缠，互相盘绞，彼此重叠；许许多多巡防队、巡防分队、巡防检查队全然无用，打家劫舍者、带兵作乱者依然明火执仗，横行无阻。所以，在这种普遍混乱中，即使在最热闹的地段，一部分民众攻打某座宫殿、府邸、房舍，并不是绝无仅有的事情。在大多数情况下，邻居并不过问，除非劫掠扩及他们自己家里。他们对火枪声充耳不闻，关上窗板，堵塞门户，听任纷扰自行解决，管它有没有巡防队干预；第二天巴黎城里人们竞相传告：“昨天夜里，埃谦纳·巴尔拜特被抢了，”“克莱蒙元帅被抓走了，”如此这般。所以，不仅王室：卢浮宫、旧王宫、巴士底、小塔之类，而且一般领主住宅：小波旁宫、桑斯府邸、昂古莱姆府邸之类，院墙上都有城垛，大门上面都有突堞。教堂由于神圣而得苟全。但是，也有一些教堂是设防的，圣母院不在此列。圣日耳曼—德—普瑞教堂武装得赛过男爵府邸，用于火炮的铜多于用于铸钟。一六一〇年还可以看见这座堡垒；今天教堂本身也所剩无几了（44）。【注：（43）孚比斯·德·夏多佩所率领的巡防队之类，也就是根据这样的一道谕旨建立起来的。（44）这座教堂今天已经荡然无存了。】">查看中文翻译</div>

The bandits, panting like a pack of hounds who are forcing a boar into his lair, pressed tumultuously round the great door, all disfigured by the battering ram, but still standing. They were waiting with a quiver for the great blow which should split it open. They vied with each other in pressing as close as possible, in order to dash among the first, when it should open, into that opulent cathedral, a vast reservoir where the wealth of three centuries had been piled up. They reminded each other with roars of exultation and greedy lust, of the beautiful silver crosses, the fine copes of brocade, the beautiful tombs of silver gilt, the great magnificences of the choir, the dazzling festivals, the Christmasses sparkling with torches, the Easters sparkling with sunshine,-- all those splendid solemneties wherein chandeliers, ciboriums, tabernacles, and reliquaries, studded the altars with a crust of gold and diamonds.

Those who did not cry out, those who were still alive, looked. Two streams of melted lead were falling from the summit of the edifice into the thickest of the rabble. That sea of men had just sunk down beneath the boiling metal, which had made, at the two points where it fell, two black and smoking holes in the crowd, such as hot water would make in snow. Dying men, half consumed and groaning with anguish, could be seen writhing there. Around these two principal streams there were drops of that horrible rain, which scattered over the assailants and entered their skulls like gimlets of fire. It was a heavy fire which overwhelmed these wretches with a thousand hailstones.</div>

There were griffins which had the air of laughing, gargoyles which one fancied one heard yelping, salamanders which puffed at the fire, tarasques which sneezed in the smoke.

<div class="line_en">All eyes were raised to the top of the church. They beheld there an extraordinary sight. On the crest of the highest gallery, higher than the central rose window, there was a great flame rising between the two towers with whirlwinds of sparks, a vast, disordered, and furious flame, a tongue of which was borne into the smoke by the wind, from time to time. Below that fire, below the gloomy balustrade with its trefoils showing darkly against its glare, two spouts with monster throats were vomiting forth unceasingly that burning rain, whose silvery stream stood out against the shadows of the lower façade. As they approached the earth, these two jets of liquid lead spread out in sheaves, like water springing from the thousand holes of a watering-pot. Above the flame, the enormous towers, two sides of each of which were visible in sharp outline, the one wholly black, the other wholly red, seemed still more vast with all the immensity of the shadow which they cast even to the sky.</div>

The gallery of the kings of France is to-day about sixty feet above the pavement. The eleven steps of the flight before the door, made it still higher. Jehan mounted slowly, a good deal incommoded by his heavy armor, holding his crossbow in one hand, and clinging to a rung with the other. When he reached the middle of the ladder, he cast a melancholy glance at the poor dead outcasts, with which the steps were strewn. "Alas!" said he, "here is a heap of bodies worthy of the fifth book of the Iliad!" Then he continued his ascent. The vagabonds followed him. There was one on every rung. At the sight of this line of cuirassed backs, undulating as they rose through the gloom, one would have pronounced it a serpent with steel scales, which was raising itself erect in front of the church.

<div class="line_en">Before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering a word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands, raised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant ladder, loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment, in the midst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman force, hurled this cluster of men backward into the Place. There was a moment when even the most resolute trembled. The ladder, launched backwards, remained erect and standing for an instant, and seemed to hesitate, then wavered, then suddenly, describing a frightful arc of a circle eighty feet in radius, crashed upon the pavement with its load of ruffians, more rapidly than a drawbridge when its chains break. There arose an immense imprecation, then all was still, and a few mutilated wretches were seen, crawling over the heap of dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">The scholar finally reached the balcony of the gallery, and climbed over it nimbly, to the applause of the whole vagabond tribe. Thus master of the citadel, he uttered a shout of joy, and suddenly halted, petrified. He had just caught sight of Quasimodo concealed in the dark, with flashing eye, behind one of the statues of the kings.</div>

<div class="line_en">A sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among the besiegers. Quasimodo, impassive, with both elbows propped on the balustrade, looked on. He had the air of an old, bushy-headed king at his window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="围攻者中间最初的胜利欢呼变成了一片痛苦而又愤怒的低声吼叫。卡席莫多漠然无所动，两肘拄着栏杆，注视下面，仿佛是一个披头散发的老国王在窗口眺望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Jehan Frollo, he was in a critical position. He found himself in the gallery with the formidable bellringer, alone, separated from his companions by a vertical wall eighty feet high. While Quasimodo was dealing with the ladder, the scholar had run to the postern which he believed to be open. It was not. The deaf man had closed it behind him when he entered the gallery. Jehan had then concealed himself behind a stone king, not daring to breathe, and fixing upon the monstrous hunchback a frightened gaze, like the man, who, when courting the wife of the guardian of a menagerie, went one evening to a love rendezvous, mistook the wall which he was to climb, and suddenly found himself face to face with a white bear.</div>

<div class="line_en">The shot sped. The feathered vireton whizzed and entered the hunchback's left arm. Quasimodo appeared no more moved by it than by a scratch to King Pharamond. He laid his hand on the arrow, tore it from his arm, and tranquilly broke it across his big knee; then he let the two pieces drop on the floor, rather than threw them down. But Jehan had no opportunity to fire a second time. The arrow broken, Quasimodo breathing heavily, bounded like a grasshopper, and he fell upon the scholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the scholar beheld himself disarmed, stripped, weak, and naked in those terrible hands, he made no attempt to speak to the deaf man, but began to laugh audaciously in his face, and to sing with his intrepid heedlessness of a child of sixteen, the then popular ditty:</div>

<div class="line_en">Quasimodo had grasped with his left hand the two arms of Jehan, who did not offer any resistance, so thoroughly did he feel that he was lost. With his right hand, the deaf man detached one by one, in silence, with sinister slowness, all the pieces of his armor, the sword, the daggers, the helmet, the cuirass, the leg pieces. One would have said that it was a monkey taking the shell from a nut. Quasimodo flung the scholar's iron shell at his feet, piece by piece.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡席莫多探出左臂，一把捉住约翰的双臂。约翰知道自己完了，不作任何挣扎。聋子又伸出右臂，一声不响，阴沉沉，缓缓地一件又一件剥去他全身的披挂：剑，两把匕首，头盔，胸甲，腿甲，好似猿猴剥核桃一般。卡席莫多把这铜铁的外壳一样样扔在脚下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There came a tremendous howl, in which were mingled all tongues, all dialects, all accents. The death of the poor scholar imparted a furious ardor to that crowd. It was seized with shame, and the wrath of having been held so long in check before a church by a hunchback. Rage found ladders, multiplied the torches, and, at the expiration of a few minutes, Quasimodo, in despair, beheld that terrible ant heap mount on all sides to the assault of Notre-Dame. Those who had no ladders had knotted ropes; those who had no ropes climbed by the projections of the carvings. They hung from each other's rags. There were no means of resisting that rising tide of frightful faces; rage made these fierce countenances ruddy; their clayey brows were dripping with sweat; their eyes darted lightnings; all these grimaces, all these horrors laid siege to Quasimodo. One would have said that some other church had despatched to the assault of Notre-Dame its gorgons, its dogs, its drées, its demons, its most fantastic sculptures. It was like a layer of living monsters on the stone monsters of the façade.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the Place was studded with a thousand torches. This scene of confusion, till now hid in darkness, was suddenly flooded with light. The parvis was resplendent, and cast a radiance on the sky; the bonfire lighted on the lofty platform was still burning, and illuminated the city far away. The enormous silhouette of the two towers, projected afar on the roofs of Paris, and formed a large notch of black in this light. The city seemed to be aroused. Alarm bells wailed in the distance. The vagabonds howled, panted, swore, climbed; and Quasimodo, powerless against so many enemies, shuddering for the gypsy, beholding the furious faces approaching ever nearer and nearer to his gallery, entreated heaven for a miracle, and wrung his arms in despair.</div>
