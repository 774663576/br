<div class="line_en">She folded the green shawl about her shoulders. She took his arm. His beauty was so great, she said, beginning to speak of Kennedy the gardener, at once he was so awfully handsome, that she couldn't dismiss him. There was a ladder against the greenhouse, and little lumps of putty stuck about, for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse. Yes, but as she strolled along with her husband, she felt that that particular source of worry had been placed. She had it on the tip of her tongue to say, as they strolled, "It'll cost fifty pounds," but instead, for her heart failed her about money, she talked about Jasper shooting birds, and he said, at once, soothing her instantly, that it was natural in a boy, and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself before long. Her husband was so sensible, so just. And so she said, "Yes; all children go through stages," and began considering the dahlias in the big bed, and wondering what about next year's flowers, and had he heard the children's nickname for Charles Tansley, she asked. The atheist, they called him, the little atheist. "He's not a polished specimen," said Mr Ramsay. "Far from it," said Mrs Ramsay.</div>

<div class="line_en">She supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices, Mrs Ramsay said, wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs; did they plant them? "Oh, he has his dissertation to write," said Mr Ramsay. She knew all about THAT, said Mrs Ramsay. He talked of nothing else. It was about the influence of somebody upon something. "Well, it's all he has to count on," said Mr Ramsay. "Pray Heaven he won't fall in love with Prue," said Mrs Ramsay. He'd disinherit her if she married him, said Mr Ramsay. He did not look at the spot about a foot or so above them. There was no harm in him, he added, and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in England who admired his -- when he choked it back. He would not bother her again about his books. These flowers seemed creditable, Mr Ramsay said, lowering his gaze and noticing something red, something brown. Yes, but then these she had put in with her own hands, said Mrs Ramsay. The question was, what happened if she sent bulbs down; did Kennedy plant them? It was his incurable laziness; she added, moving on. If she stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand, he did sometimes do a stroke of work. So they strolled along, towards the red-hot pokers. "You're teaching your daughters to exaggerate," said Mr Ramsay, reproving her. Her Aunt Camilla was far worse than she was, Mrs Ramsay remarked. "Nobody ever held up your Aunt Camilla as a model of virtue that I'm aware of," said Mr Ramsay. "She was the most beautiful woman I ever saw," said Mrs Ramsay. "Somebody else was that," said Mr Ramsay. Prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was, said Mrs Ramsay. He saw no trace of it, said Mr Ramsay. "Well, then, look tonight," said Mrs Ramsay. They paused. He wished Andrew could be induced to work harder. He would lose every chance of a scholarship if he didn't. "Oh, scholarships!" she said. Mr Ramsay thought her foolish for saying that, about a serious thing, like a scholarship. He should be very proud of Andrew if he got a scholarship, he said. She would be just as proud of him if he didn't, she answered. They disagreed always about this, but it did not matter. She liked him to believe in scholarships, and he liked her to be proud of Andrew whatever he did. Suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wasn't it late? she asked. They hadn't come home yet. He flicked his watch carelessly open. But it was only just past seven. He held his watch open for a moment, deciding that he would tell her what he had felt on the terrace. To begin with, it was not reasonable to be so nervous. Andrew could look after himself. Then, he wanted to tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just now -- here he became uncomfortable, as if he were breaking into that solitude, that aloofness, that remoteness of hers… But she pressed him. What had he wanted to tell her, she asked, thinking it was about going to the Lighthouse; that he was sorry he had said "Damn you." But no. He did not like to see her look so sad, he said. Only wool gathering, she protested, flushing a little. They both felt uncomfortable, as if they did not know whether to go on or go back. She had been reading fairy tales to James, she said. No, they could not share that; they could not say that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不是已经很晚了吧？她问道。他们还没有回来呢。他漫不经心地打开怀表盖。可是刚刚才过七点。他把打开了盖的表在手里拿了一会儿，决定把他在平台上的感受告诉她。首先，这样紧张是没有道理的。安德鲁能够照顾他自己。然后，他想告诉她，刚才他在平台上散步时——他感到有点不自在，好像他闯进了她那份孤独，那份超然，那份冷淡……但她追问他。他想告诉她什么来着，她问，心想是关于去灯塔的事；他为说了“真该死”而感到遗憾、但是，不是的。他不愿意看到她样子这样悲哀，他说。只不过在暗想，她申明道，脸微微红了。他们两人都感到不自在，好像不知道是继续往前走还是回去。她刚才给詹姆斯念童话故事来着，她说。不，在这方面他们无法交流；他们无法谈论此事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had reached the gap between the two clumps of red-hot pokers, and there was the Lighthouse again, but she would not let herself look at it. Had she known that he was looking at her, she thought, she would not have let herself sit there, thinking. She disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking. So she looked over her shoulder, at the town. The lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind. And all the poverty, all the suffering had turned to that, Mrs Ramsay thought. The lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk. Well, if he could not share her thoughts, Mr Ramsay said to himself, he would be off, then, on his own. He wanted to go on thinking, telling himself the story how Hume was stuck in a bog; he wanted to laugh. But first it was nonsense to be anxious about Andrew. When he was Andrew's age he used to walk about the country all day long, with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him, or thought that he had fallen over a cliff. He said aloud he thought he would be off for a day's walk if the weather held. He had had about enough of Bankes and of Carmichael. He would like a little solitude. Yes, she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们已经来到了那两丛开花的芦苇之间的间隙处。灯塔在望，但她却不让自己去看它。如果她知道他刚才在看她，她想，她就不会让自己坐在那里沉思了。她不喜欢任何使她想起她坐在那里想被人看见的事。于是她回过头去石小镇。灯火流光溢彩。仿佛是被风牢牢托起的银色水珠。一切贫穷、一切痛苦，都变成了那片灯光，打姆齐夫人想道。小镇、港口和船上的灯光仿佛是悬浮在那儿的一张无形的网，标志着某种沉没的事物。好吧，如果他不能分享她的想法，拉姆齐先生对自己说，那么他就想自己的心思吧。他想继续刚才的思路，对自己讲休谟如何陷进泥沼的故事；他很想大笑。但首先他要说，为安德鲁担心是毫无意义的。他像安德鲁这个年纪的时候。总是整天在乡间满处乱走，除了口袋里的一块饼干之外什么也不带，从来没人为他操心，或以为他跌下了悬崖。他大声说出来的是，如果天气没有变化。他想出去徒步活动一天。班克斯和卡迈克尔已经让他受够了。他想独自清静一天。好吧，她说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It annoyed him that she did not protest. She knew that he would never do it. He was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket. She worried about the boys, but not about him. Years ago, before he had married, he thought, looking across the bay, as they stood between the clumps of red-hot pokers, he had walked all day. He had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house. He had worked ten hours at a stretch; an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire. That was the country he liked best, over there; those sandhills dwindling away into darkness. One could walk all day without meeting a soul. There was not a house scarcely, not a single village for miles on end. One could worry things out alone. There were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time. The seals sat up and looked at you. It sometimes seemed to him that in a little house out there, alone -- he broke off, sighing. He had no right. The father of eight children -- he reminded himself. And he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single thing altered. Andrew would be a better man than he had been. Prue would be a beauty, her mother said. They would stem the flood a bit. That was a good bit of work on the whole -- his eight children. They showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely, for on an evening like this, he thought, looking at the land dwindling away, the little island seemed pathetically small, half swallowed up in the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有反对，这让他很不高兴。她知道他是不会这佯做的。他现在不足口袋里装块饼干就出去走上一天的年龄了。她担心的是儿子们，不是他。多年以前，那时他还没有结婚，他们站在开花的芦苇丛之间，他远望着海湾的对岸，心里想，他曾经徒步行走了一整天。他曾在一家小酒店以面包和奶酪充饥。他曾经一连工作十个小时；只有一个老太婆时不时进来照看一下火炉。那就是他最喜欢的乡间，在那边；那些逐渐消隐在黑暗之中的沙丘。你可以走上一整天一个人都碰不上。一连多少英里几乎没有一所房子，没有一个村庄。你可以独自冥思苦想。那里有从盘古以来就渺无人迹的小片沙滩。海豹竖起身子朝着你看。有时候他似乎感到，在那儿的一所小房子里，独自一人——他中断了思路，叹了一口气。他没有这份权利。八个孩子的父亲——他提醒自己。如果他希望有丝毫的改变，他就猪狗不如了。安德鲁会比他强。普鲁会出落成一个美人，她的母亲是这样说的。他们会稍微阻挡一下那股洪流。总的说来那是不错的成就——他的八个孩子。他们的存在表明他并没有把这可怜的小小的宇宙彻底诅咒得一钱不值，因为在这样一个黄昏，他想道，看着陆地渐渐消失，这个小岛一半已被大海吞没，显得小得可怜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She heard him. He said the most melancholy things, but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual. All this phrase-making was a game, she thought, for if she had said half what he said, she would have blown her brains out by now.</div>

<div class="line_en">They turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the silver-green spear-like plants grew, arm in arm. His arm was almost like a young man's arm, Mrs Ramsay thought, thin and hard, and she thought with delight how strong he still was, though he was over sixty, and how untamed and optimistic, and how strange it was that being convinced, as he was, of all sorts of horrors, seemed not to depress him, but to cheer him. Was it not odd, she reflected? Indeed he seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people, born blind, deaf, and dumb, to the ordinary things, but to the extraordinary things, with an eye like an eagle's. His understanding often astonished her. But did he notice the flowers? No. Did he notice the view? No. Did he even notice his own daughter's beauty, or whether there was pudding on his plate or roast beef? He would sit at table with them like a person in a dream. And his habit of talking aloud, or saying poetry aloud, was growing on him, she was afraid; for sometimes it was awkward --</div>

<div class="line_en">Best and brightest come away! poor Miss Giddings, when he shouted that at her, almost jumped out of her skin. But then, Mrs Ramsay, though instantly taking his side against all the silly Giddingses in the world, then, she thought, intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too fast for her, and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were fresh molehills on the bank, then, she thought, stooping down to look, a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours. All the great men she had ever known, she thought, deciding that a rabbit must have got in, were like that, and it was good for young men (though the atmosphere of lecture-rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond endurance almost) simply to hear him, simply to look at him. But without shooting rabbits, how was one to keep them down? she wondered. It might be a rabbit; it might be a mole. Some creature anyhow was ruining her Evening Primroses. And looking up, she saw above the thin trees the first pulse of the full-throbbing star, and wanted to make her husband look at it; for the sight gave her such keen pleasure. But she stopped herself. He never looked at things. If he did, all he would say would be, Poor little world, with one of his sighs.</div>
