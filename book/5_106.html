<div class="line_en">For his part, Johnny had fit into the Mularkey clan as if he'd been born into it. He'd never admitted it, but Kate was certain that he liked being part of a family again after so many solitary years. Although they didn't talk about the future, they enjoyed every minute of the present.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="不过状况即将改变。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Falling in love was everything Kate had dreamed it would be. By the time spring came again, painting the landscape with vibrant color, she and Johnny were an honest-to-God couple; they spent most of their weekends together and as many weeknights as possible. In March she'd brought him home to meet the parents and they'd been ecstatic. A nice Irish Catholic boy with a great career and a good sense of humor who liked to play board games and cards. Dad called him a "good egg" and Mom declared him to be perfect. "Definitely worth waiting for," she'd whispered at the end of the first meeting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱情果然如凯蒂梦想般的美好。当春天将大地染上鲜艳色彩，她和强尼已经是不折不扣的情侣了，他们每个周末都在一起，平日也尽可能见面。三月时，她带他回家见父母，他们开心极了。在他们眼中他极尽理想：爱尔兰天主教徒、前途无量、有幽默感，而且喜欢玩桌上游戏和纸牌，老爸称赞他和气又可靠，老妈更是直接打一百分。第一次见面结束时，妈妈悄声说：“绝对值得等待。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now she was in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Beside her, Johnny lay sleeping. It was just past four o'clock in the morning and already she'd thrown up twice. There was no point in putting off the inevitable any longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻她躺在床上望着天花板，强尼在旁边睡得很熟。时间刚过凌晨四点，但她已经反胃两次了。终究要面对现实，继续拖延也没用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, if only she could say it to Johnny. She ought to be able to say anything to him, wasn't that how love was supposed to work? God knew she loved him enough, maybe even more than enough. She could no longer imagine a life without him. She loved the routine of their lives, the way they often had breakfast together in the kitchen of his houseboat, standing side by side in front of the sink, or the way they sat in bed at night, snuggled together, watching Arsenio Hall. When he kissed her, whether it was a quiet goodnight kiss or a passionate let's-start-something one, her heart always kicked into high gear. They talked all the time, about anything and everything; until today, she would have said there were no words she couldn't say to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果能告诉强尼就好了。她应该要能对他无话不说，爱情不就是这样吗？她对他的爱绝对足够，甚至远远超过，老天可以作证。她再也无法想象没有他的生活，她喜欢他们日常的步调，他们经常一起在他的船屋吃早餐，并肩站在洗碗槽前，晚上则在床上看脱口秀；每当他亲吻她，她的心跳都会激烈加速，无论是淡暖的晚安吻，或是激情的前戏吻；他们经常聊天，话题天南地北，包罗万象，在今天之前，她绝对敢说他们两个无话不谈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, the sun was a pale white ball in a washed-out blue sky. A few hardy tourists walked up and down Pioneer Square.

The trees around them were in full bloom.</div>

Last week I interviewed a guy in Cheney who's built a truck that runs on wood. I kid you not. He has a stove in the bed that's the size of an aircraft carrier and it takes a half a cord a week. I could barely see the damn truck through the black smoke it belched out, and he wanted me to report that he'd discovered the future. Tomorrow I'm supposed to go to Lyn-den to interview some Hutterite chick who won thirty-two blue ribbons at the fair. Yippee. Oh, and last week --"</div>

<div class="line_en">With that, Kate felt the past rear up between them. She knew Tully was feeling it, too, this thing they tried so hard to forget: their shared knowledge of John Ryan. "You're like him," she finally said. "How will he feel when he finds out?"</div>

It had never felt quite so fragile before, or so bittersweet. All her life she'd imagined love as a durable thing, a polyester emotion that could handle the wear and tear of everyday action, but now she saw how dangerous that perception was. It lulled you, put you at risk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate had taken Tully's advice -- of course -- and gone for timeless elegance. Her wedding dress was an ivory silk gown with a heavily beaded bodice and an off-the-shoulder neckline. Her hair, carefully lightened in a trio of blonds, had been drawn back from her face and coiled into a Grace Kelly twist. The veil, when she put it on, would float over her face and fall down to her shoulders like a sparkling cloud. For the first time in her life she felt movie-star beautiful. Mom thought so, too; she took one look and started to cry. A few moments ago she had hugged Kate fiercely, kissed her cheek, and gone into the church, leaving Kate and Tully alone for the first time all day.</div>
