<div class="line_en">Louis XVIII made only feeble efforts to ward off this terrible blow: his lack of confidence in men deprived him of any confidence in events. Kingship or, rather, the monarchy, which he had barely rebuilt, was already trembling on its uncertain foundations and a single gesture from the emperor brought the entire edifice crashing down, a shapeless compound of old prejudices and new ideas. So Villefort received nothing from his king except gratitude, and that was not only useless for the time being, but actually dangerous; and the cross of the Legion of Honour which he was wise enough not to display, even though M. de Blacas had done as the king required and duly sent him the certificate.</div>

<div class="line_en">M. Noirtier was a good prophet and events moved quickly, as he had said. Everyone knows about the return from Elba, that strange and miraculous return, with no earlier precedent and probably destined to remain unique for all time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺梯埃先生真是一个预言家，事情急速地演变，正如他的预料。谁都知道从爱尔巴岛卷土重来的这件著名的史实，——那次希奇而神妙的归来，非但是前无古人，而且大概也会后无来者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Villefort would surely have been dismissed by Napoleon, had it not been for the protection of Noirtier, who had become all-powerful at court under the Hundred Days, both for the danger that he had run and for the services he had rendered. So, as promised, the Girondin of '93 and the Senator of 1806 protected the man who had earlier protected him. Consequently, all Villefort's efforts during this reincarnation of the empire -- which, it was not difficult to predict, would fall again -- consisted in suppressing the secret which Dantès had been on the point of divulging. The crown prosecutor alone was dismissed, suspected of lack of enthusiasm for Bonapartism.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺梯埃当时权倾全朝，要不是为了他，拿破仑无疑的早已把维尔福免职了。这个一七九三年的吉伦特党徒和一八〇六年的上议员就这样保护着维尔福，而不久以前，维尔福还是他的保护人。在帝国复活的那个期间——这个帝国是很易于预见到其二次倾覆的——维尔福的全部力量都用来封住那几乎被邓蒂斯所泄漏的秘密。只有检察官被免了职，因为他有忠心于王室的嫌疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Naturally, the turn of events meant that the worthy shipowner, whom we have already described as a supporter of the people's party, found himself in these circumstances, if not exactly all-powerful -- since M. Morrel was a cautious and slightly timid man, like all those who have made their fortunes in trade by their own laborious efforts -- at least able to stand up and lodge a complaint, even though he was dismissed as a moderate by Bonapartist fanatics. And his complaint, as one may easily imagine, concerned Dantès.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于这种转变，那可敬的船主在当时虽不能说势倾全市，——因为摩莱尔是一个谨慎而且可说是胆小的人，以致许多最热心的拿破仑党分子竟斥他为“温和派”——但却已有足够的势力可使他所提出的要求闻达于当局；而那个要求，我们很易于推测到，是以邓蒂斯作主题的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The imperial regime was re-established, which meant that the emperor moved into the Tuileries that Louis XVIII had just left, and began to issue a host of different orders from the little study into which, hard on the heels of Villefort, we recently introduced our readers, and from the walnut table on which he found Louis XVIII's snuffbox, wide open and still half full. And, no sooner had this happened than Marseille, despite the attitude of its judiciary, began to feel the warmth of those smouldering fires of civil war that are never entirely extinguished in the South. The reprisals threatened to exceed the occasional rowdy outburst against the houses of Royalists who decided to stay indoors, or public insults hurled at those who ventured outside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帝国的权力刚刚重新建立，——就是说，皇帝刚刚住进土伊勒里宫，从我们已经向读者们介绍过的那间小书房里发出无数命令，在桌子上还可找到路易十八留下的那半空的鼻烟盒还敞开在那里的时候，——在马赛，不管官员们的态度如何，人民却已知道：内战的余烬（内战在南部只有部分地熄灭）已开始重新燃烧；保王党党员如敢冒险出外，一定会遭到斥骂和侮辱，这时如果要挑起人民来对他们报复，也不费吹灰之力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Villefort had remained on his feet, despite his superior's dismissal, but his wedding, though still agreed in principle, had been postponed until more propitious times. If the emperor should keep his throne, then Gérard would need to marry into another family and his father would find a suitable match for him. If Louis XVIII returned to France under a second Restoration, M. de Saint-Méran's influence and his own would be greatly increased, and the union become more favourable to him than ever. So, for the time being, the deputy crown prosecutor was the principal magistrate in Marseille; and, one day, his door opened and M. Morrel was announced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福的上司虽已倒台，他本人却依旧保住了原职，但他的婚事已暂时搁在一边，以等待一个更有利的时机。假如皇帝在位不去，则杰拉就需要一个不同的联姻来帮助他的事业，他的父亲已负责在给他找一个。假如路易十八重登王位，则圣·米兰侯爵的势力就会象他自己一样大大地增加，那桩婚事就比以前更美满了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyone else would have hastened to greet the shipowner, betraying his own weakness in his haste. But Villefort was a man of superior intelligence who, though he had little experience of the world, had an instinct for it. He kept M. Morrel waiting, as he would have done under the Restoration, not because he had anyone with him, but simply because it is normal for a crown prosecutor to keep people waiting; then, after a quarter of an hour which he spent reading two or three newspapers of various persuasions, he gave the order for the shipowner to be shown in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时，代理检察官是马赛的首席法官，有一天早晨，仆人推开门来，报告摩莱尔先生来访。要是换了别人，就会赶快接见他。但维尔福是一个很能干的人，他知道这样等于是示弱。所以虽然他并没有别的客人，却仍让摩莱尔在外客厅里等候，理由只是因为代理检察官总是要叫每一个人都等候一下的，读了一刻钟的报纸以后，他吩咐请摩莱尔先生进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">M. Morrel expected to find Villefort dejected; but he found him as he had seen him six weeks earlier, that is to say calm, firm and full of the distant good manners that make up the most impenetrable of barriers separating a well-bred man from one of the people. He had entered Villefort's chambers convinced that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him, only to discover that, on the contrary, he was himself overcome with nervousness and anxiety when confronted with this man who was waiting for him with an enquiring look and his elbows resting on his desk. He paused at the door. Villefort examined him, as though he could not quite remember who he was. At last, after studying him in silence for some seconds, during which the good shipowner twisted and untwisted his hat in his hands, Villefort said: "Monsieur Morrel, I believe?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="摩莱尔预料维尔福将是垂头丧气的。但看到他的时候，却发觉他仍象六个星期以前见到他的时候一样，镇定，稳重，神色里充满着冷冰冰的礼貌，那种礼貌是一切隔阂中最难超越的一种，是教养有素的上等人和俗人之间的一道分界线。他已进入维尔福的书房。满心相信那法官一见他就会发抖，可是相反，当他看到维尔福坐在那儿，手肘支在办公桌上，用手托着头的时候，他感到自己周身一阵寒颤。他在门口停了下来。维尔福向他凝视了一会儿，象是有点不认识他似的。在这一段短短的时间内，那诚实的船主只是困惑地把他的帽子在两手之间转动着，然后——“是摩莱尔先生吧，我相信？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Monsieur," continued the shipowner, gaining in confidence as he spoke, and further strengthened by the justice of his case and the clarity of his position, "you remember that, a few days before the news of His Majesty the Emperor's landing, I came to beg your indulgence for an unfortunate young man, a sailor, who was second mate on board my brig. You will recall that he was accused of being in contact with the island of Elba: this connection, though a crime in those days, is now a recommendation. At that time, you served Louis XVIII and you did so unreservedly, Monsieur -- that was your duty. Today, you are serving Napoleon, and you should protect him -- that, too, is your duty. So I have come to ask you what became of him."</div>

But Morrel, who had looked in vain for any sign of fear in Villefort, as soon as the man appeared to have none, perceived only a desire to oblige: he was no match for Villefort.</div>

<div class="line_en">Villefort parried this thrust with his usual agility and cool-headedness. "Monsieur, I was a Royalist as long as I considered the Bourbons not only the rightful heirs to the throne but also the choice of the nation. However, the miraculous turn of events that we have just witnessed proved to me that I was wrong. Napoleon's genius has triumphed: the legitimate monarch is the one who has the love of the people."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阁下，”维尔福答道，“我那时是一个保王党，因为那时我相信波旁王室不但是王位的嫡系继承者，而且是国人所拥戴的君主。但拿破仑那次不可思议的归来证明我是错了，只有万民所爱戴的人才是合法的君王。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Villefort shuddered at the idea of the prisoner cursing him in the darkness and silence, but he had gone too far to retreat. Dantès would have to be broken between the cogs of his ambition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福一想到那个犯人在那黑暗寂静的牢狱里咒骂他，就不禁打了个寒颤。但他却绝不至于会让步，——在维尔福的野心的重压之下，邓蒂斯必须被摧毁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Villefort dictated a request in which, undoubtedly with the best of intentions, he exaggerated Dantès' patriotism and the service he had rendered to the Bonapartist cause. In it, Dantès became one of the most significant figures in ensuring Napoleon's return: clearly, when he saw the document, the minister must immediately see that justice was done, if it had not been done already.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“还有什么别的步骤？”摩莱尔问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for Villefort, instead of sending the request to Paris, he put it carefully aside for safekeeping, knowing that what might save Dantès in the present would become a disastrously compromising document in the future, in the event -- which the situation in Europe and course of affairs already allowed him to predict -- of a second Restoration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但维尔福却并没有把它送到巴黎去，只是小心地把那封极易陷害邓蒂斯的请愿书保存了起来，以等待那件似乎并非不可能的事情发生，那就是：二次复辟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“去等着吧，”维尔福回答，“一切由我来好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Dantès remained a prisoner. In the depths of the dungeon where he was buried, no sound reached him of the resounding crash of Louis XVIII's throne or of the still more dreadful collapse of the empire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以邓蒂斯依旧还是一个被埋没在黑牢深处的囚徒，他毫未听到路易十八的宝座垮台的风声，以及当帝国倾覆时的更可怕的骚动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrel's hopes were raised by this assurance; he left the deputy prosecutor's office delighted with himself and went to tell Dantès' father that he would be seeing his son before long.</div>

<div class="line_en">Villefort, however, had watched all this closely and listened to it attentively. On two occasions during the brief reappearance of the emperor known as the Hundred Days, M. Morrel had renewed his efforts, always demanding that Dantès be released, and each time Villefort had reassured him with promises and expectations. Finally, Waterloo. Morrel was not again seen at Villefort's: the shipowner had done everything humanly possible for his young friend and, if he were to make any further attempt under this second Restoration, he would compromise himself, to no useful end.</div>

<div class="line_en">Louis XVIII returned to the throne. For Villefort, Marseille was full of memories that were soured with remorse, so he requested and obtained the vacant post of crown prosecutor in Toulouse. A fortnight after moving into his new home, he married Mlle Renée de Saint-Méran, whose father was more in favour at court than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路易十八重登王位。马赛能引起维尔福内心愧疚的记忆太多，所以他请求并获得了调任图卢兹检察官的位置，两星期后，就和丽妮结婚，她的父亲在朝的地位已比以前更受宠信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Danglars witnessed Napoleon's return to France, he realized the full effect of the blow he had directed against Dantès: his denunciation had been accurate and, like all men with a certain natural aptitude for crime and only average understanding of ordinary life, he described this strange coincidence as "a decree of Providence". But when Napoleon had returned to Paris and his voice, imperious and powerful, was heard once more in the land, Danglars knew fear. At every moment he expected Dantès to reappear, a Dantès who knew everything, a Dantès who was strong and who threatened every kind of vengeance. So he gave M. Morrel notice of his desire to renounce seafaring and obtained a reference from him to a Spanish trader, whose service he entered as accounts clerk towards the end of March, that is to say ten or twelve days after Napoleon's return to the Tuileries. He left for Madrid and nothing more was heard of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">While this was happening, among all these painful changes, the empire called for a final muster of soldiers and every man who was capable of bearing arms marched across the frontier of France in obedience to the emperor's resounding call. Fernand set off with the rest, leaving his hut, leaving Mercédès, devoured by the dark and dreadful thought that, when he had gone, his rival might return and marry the woman he loved. If ever Fernand meant to kill himself, he would have done so on leaving Mercédès.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Fernand, he understood nothing. Dantès had gone away; that was enough. What had happened to him? Fernand did not try to find out. Throughout the reprieve that this absence gave him, he strove, partly to mislead Mercédès about the reasons for it, and partly to devise plans for emigration and abduction. From time to time -- these were the dark moments in his life -- he also sat at the extremity of the Cap Pharo, at the point from which you can see both Marseille and the Catalan village, sad, motionless as a bird of prey, watching in case he might see, returning by one or other of these routes, the handsome young man who walked freely, with his head held high; and who, for Fernand also, had become the messenger of a cruel revenge. In that event, Fernand was decided: he would break Dantès' skull with his gun and then, he thought, afterwards kill himself, to disguise the murder. But Fernand was mistaken: he would never kill himself, because he lived in hope.</div>
