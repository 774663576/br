<div class="line_en">The rains came and went, but there was more grey sky than blue, and all the streams were running high. On the morning of the third day, Arya noticed that the moss was growing mostly on the wrong side of the trees. "We're going the wrong way," she said to Gendry, as they rode past an especially mossy elm. "We're going south. See how the moss is growing on the trunk?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She missed him more than she thought she would, but Harwin made up for it some. She had told him about his father Hullen, and how she'd found him dying by the stables in the Red Keep, the day she fled. "He always said he'd die in a stable," Harwin said, "but we all thought some bad-tempered stallion would be his death, not a pack of lions." Arya told of Yoren and their escape from King's Landing as well, and much that had happened since, but she left out the stableboy she'd stabbed with Needle, and the guard whose throat she'd cut to get out of Harrenhal. Telling Harwin would be almost like telling her father, and there were some things that she could not bear having her father know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，艾莉亚发觉自己莫名地想念他，好在还有哈尔温。她把胡伦的事对哈尔温说了，逃离红堡那天，她在马厩门边发现奄奄一息的马房总管。“唉，他常说自己会在马厩里过世，”哈尔温道，“我们都担心他到头来会断送在坏脾气的马脚下，想不到下手的却是狮子。”艾莉亚还把尤伦的事，逃出君临的事，以及其他许多经过都向对方倾诉，但留出她用缝衣针杀死马房小弟和割赫伦堡守卫喉咙的部分没有讲——跟哈尔温讲故事就跟和父亲讲故事差不多，有些事是不能坦白的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nor did she speak of Jaqen Hghar and the three deaths he'd owed and paid. The iron coin he'd given her Arya kept tucked away beneath her belt, but sometimes at night she would take it out and remember how his face had melted and changed when he ran his hand across it.

Thoros and Ser Raymun Darry and their men, Ser Gladden Wylde, a lord named Lothar Mallery. But Gregor was waiting for us at the Mummer's Ford, with men concealed on both banks. As we crossed he fell upon us from front and rear.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only six Winterfell men remained of the twenty her father had sent west with Beric Dondarrion, Harwin told her, and they were scattered. "It was a trap, milady.

If he had he would have been killed, or taken prisoner and traded for the Imp, who was your lady mother's captive at the time. Only the Kingslayer never knew Lord Tywin's plan, and when he heard about his brother's capture he attacked your father in the streets of King's Landing."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Every man of us was certain his lordship would be dead by daybreak. But Thoros prayed with him all night beside the fire, and when dawn came, he was still alive, and stronger than he'd been. It was a fortnight before he could mount a horse, but his courage kept us strong. He told us that our war had not ended at the Mummer's Ford, but only begun there, and that every man of ours who'd fallen would be avenged tenfold.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I saw the Mountain slay Raymun Darry with a single blow so terrible that it took Darry's arm off at the elbow and killed the horse beneath him too. Gladden Wylde died there with him, and Lord Mallery was ridden down and drowned. We had lions on every side, and I thought I was doomed with the rest, but Alyn shouted commands and restored order to our ranks, and those still a horse rallied around Thoros and cut our way free. Six score we'd been that morning. By dark no more than two score were left, and Lord Beric was gravely wounded. Thoros drew a foot of lance from his chest that night, and poured boiling wine into the hole it left."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That turned the whole world on its head. We'd been sent out by the King's Hand to deal with outlaws, you see, but now we were the outlaws, and Lord Tywin was the Hand of the King. There was some wanted to yield then, but Lord Beric wouldn't hear of it. We were still king's men, he said, and these were the king's people the lions were savaging. If we could not fight for Robert, we would fight for them, until every man of us was dead. And so we did, but as we fought something queer happened. For every man we lost, two showed up to take his place. A few were knights or squires, of gentle birth, but most were common men fieldhands and fiddlers and innkeeps, servants and shoemakers, even two septons.

<div class="line_en">The next morning they left the road to cut across the fields. The wind was gusting, sending dry brown leaves swirling around the hooves of their horses, but for once it did not rain. When the sun came out from behind a cloud, it was so bright Arya had to pull her hood forward to keep it out of her eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">North or south, east or west, that made no matter now. She could find the way to Riverrun later, once she'd lost them. Arya leaned forward in the saddle and urged the horse to a gallop. Behind her the outlaws were cursing and shouting at her to come back. She shut her ears to the calls, but when she glanced back over her shoulder four of them were coming after her, Anguy and Harwin and Greenbeard racing side by side with Lem farther back, his big yellow cloak flapping behind him as he rode. "Swift as a deer," she told her mount. "Run, now, run."</div>

<div class="line_en">Captive. Arya took a breath to still her soul. Calm as still water. She glanced at the outlaws on their horses, and turned her horse's head. Now, quick as a snake, she thought, as she slammed her heels into the courser's flank. Right between Greenbeard and Jack-Be-Lucky she flew, and caught one glimpse of Gendry's startled face as his mare moved out of her way. And then she was in the open field, and running.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="俘虏。艾莉亚深吸一口气，以稳定心绪。止如水。她瞥瞥骑马的土匪们，默然调转坐骑。迅如蛇。她一边想，一边用脚后跟猛踢马腹，从绿胡子和幸运杰克中间飞奔而去。詹德利的母马从面前一闪而过，她看到男孩脸上震惊的表情，随后便置身于旷野之中狂奔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya dashed across brown weedy fields, through waist-high grass and piles of dry leaves that flurried and flew when her horse galloped past. There were woods to her left, she saw. I can lose them there. A dry ditch ran along one side of the field, but she leapt it without breaking stride, and plunged in among the stand of elm and yew and birch trees. A quick peek back showed Anguy and Harwin still hard on her heels. Greenbeard had fallen behind, though, and she could not see Lem at all. "Faster," she told her horse, "you can, you can."</div>

<div class="line_en">A stream barred her way. She splashed down into it, through water choked with wet brown leaves. Some clung to her horse's legs as they climbed the other side. The undergrowth was thicker here, the ground so full of roots and rocks that she had to slow, but she kept as good a pace as she dared. Another hill before her, this one steeper. Up she went, and down again. How big are these woods? she wondered. She had the faster horse, she knew that, she had stolen one of Roose Bolton's best from the stables at Harrenhal, but his speed was wasted here. I need to find the fields again. I need to find a road. instead she found a game trail. It was narrow and uneven, but it was something. She raced along it, branches whipping at her face. One snagged her hood and yanked it back, and for half a heartbeat she feared they had caught her. A vixen burst from the brush as she passed, startled by the fury of her flight. The game trail brought her to another stream. Or was it the same one? Had she gotten turned around? There was no time to puzzle it out, she could hear their horses crashing through the trees behind her. Thorns scratched at her face like the cats she used to chase in King's Landing. Sparrows exploded from the branches of an alder. But the trees were thinning now, and suddenly she was out of them. Broad level fields stretched before her, all weeds and wild wheat, sodden and trampled. Arya kicked her horse back to a gallop. Run, she thought, run for Riverrun, run for home. Had she lost them? She took one quick look, and there was Harwin six yards back and gaining. No, she thought, no, he can't, not him, it isn't fair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一条小河挡在面前，她纵马踏进，淌过充塞棕色湿叶的流水，上岸时，不少叶子沾在马腿上。此处灌木较浓密，地上满是树根和石块，不得不减慢速度，但她仍不停地催促马儿。面前出现另一座小山，这座更陡峭。她爬上去，从另一面下来。树林究竟有多大？她疑惑地想。她知道自己的坐骑比较快，因为它是赫伦堡卢斯·波顿的马厩里最好的马之一，但速度在这儿派不上用场。我得返回平原，找到道路。她找了半天，却只发现一条猎人小径，狭窄又崎岖，但好歹比没有强。她沿着小径开跑，任凭树枝抽打脸颊，一根枝条勾住兜帽，将其掠到后面，片刻之间，她好害怕自己会被打下马来。有只狐狸被狂野的奔驰所惊扰，从灌木丛中窜出。小径将她带到另一条小河边。还是同一条河？莫非我在原地打转？没时间多想，马蹄声从身后传来。再往后，她的脸被荆棘划破，她知道自己一定像以前在君临追赶的那些猫一样难看。麻雀从桤木枝头飞散。树木变得稀疏，突然之间，她便走出了森林，宽阔平坦的原野在眼前展开，布满遭到践踏的湿草和野麦。艾莉亚踢马飞驰。跑啊！她心想，跑到奔流城，跑回家去！甩掉他们了吗？她飞快地向后一看，天！哈尔温只差了六码，而且还在接近中。不，她绝望地想，不，他不能，不该是他，这不公平。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Between two elms she rode, and never paused to see which side the moss was growing on. She leapt a rotten log and swung wide around a monstrous deadfall, jagged with broken branches. Then up a gentle slope and down the other side, slowing and speeding up again, her horse's shoes striking sparks off the flintstones underfoot. At the top of the hill she glanced back. Harwin had pushed ahead of Anguy, but both were coming hard. Greenbeard had fallen further back and seemed to be flagging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从两棵榆树间穿过，丝毫不在意苔藓长在哪边。随后又跃过一段朽木，远远绕开一棵倾倒的巨大枯树，断裂的枝杈从枯树中间伸出来。上了一个缓坡，又从另一侧下去，减速，加速，马蹄与硬石相击，溅出点点火花。登上小山，她再度向后瞥去。此时哈尔温已领先安盖，两人都在努力。绿胡子则越跑越慢，似乎快放弃了。">查看中文翻译</div>
