<div class="line_en">When they lost their way, as happened once or twice, they need only wait for a clear cold night when the clouds did not intrude, and look up in the sky for the Ice Dragon. The blue star in the dragon's eye pointed the way north, as Osha told him once. Thinking of Osha made Bran wonder where she was. He pictured her safe in White Harbor with Rickon and Shaggydog, eating eels and fish and hot crab pie with fat Lord Manderly. Or maybe they were warming themselves at the Last Hearth before the Greatjon's fires. But Bran's life had turned into endless chilly days on Hodor's back, riding his basket up and down the slopes of mountains.</div>

<div class="line_en">No roads ran through the twisted mountain valleys where they walked now. Between the grey stone peaks lay still blue lakes, long and deep and narrow, and the green gloom of endless piney woods. The russet and gold of autumn leaves grew less common when they left the wolfswood to climb amongst the old flint hills, and vanished by the time those hills had turned to mountains. Giant grey-green sentinels loomed above them now, and spruce and fir and soldier pines in endless profusion. The undergrowth was sparse beneath them, the forest floor carpeted in dark green needles.</div>

<div class="line_en">The high glens seldom did them the courtesy of running north and south, so often they found themselves going long leagues in the wrong direction, and sometimes they were forced to double back the way they'd come. "If we took the kingsroad we could be at the Wall by now," Bran would remind the Reeds. He wanted to find the three-eyed crow, so he could learn to fly.

<div class="line_en">But here in the mountains, the streams were smaller and more icy, and the game scarcer. Meera still hunted and fished when she could, but it was harder, and some nights even Summer found no prey. Often they went to sleep with empty bellies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但在群山之间，溪流不仅更细小，且往往覆冰，猎物也比较稀少。梅拉仍尽力打猎捕鱼，却效果不彰，有的晚上，甚至夏天也逮不到猎物。他们只好饿着肚子入睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If we took the kingsroad we wouldn't be so hungry either," he started saying then. Down in the hills they'd had no lack of food. Meera was a fine huntress, and even better at taking fish from streams with her three-pronged frog spear. Bran liked to watch her, admiring her quickness, the way she sent the spear lancing down and pulled it back with a silvery trout wriggling on the end of it. And they had Summer hunting for them as well. The direwolf vanished most every night as the sun went down, but he was always back again before dawn, most often with something in his jaws, a squirrel or a hare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果走国王大道，就不会忍饥挨饿了，”现在他开始这么提。在丘陵地带，他们并不缺食物。梅拉是个好猎手，更擅用三叉捕蛙矛抓鱼。布兰喜欢看她行动，暗暗羡慕她的敏捷。只见那矛闪电般出击，抽回来时，尖头上便会有一尾银光闪闪的鲑鱼翻腾扭动。他们也让夏天为他们捕猎。冰原狼每天傍晚消失，黎明前回来，多半嘴里叼着东西，一只松鼠或一只野兔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Jojen remained stubbornly determined to stay well away from roads. "Where you find roads you find travelers," he said in that way he had, "and travelers have eyes to see, and mouths to spread tales of the crippled boy, his giant, and the wolf that walks beside them." No one could get as stubborn as Jojen, so they struggled on through the wild, and every day climbed a little higher, and moved a little farther north.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's people," Bran told her. "The Umbers are mostly east of the kingsroad, but they graze their sheep in the high meadows in summer. There are Wulls west of the mountains along the Bay of Ice, Harclays back behind us in the hills, and Knotts and Liddles and Norreys and even some Flints up here in the high places." His father's mother's mother had been a Flint of the mountains. Old Nan once said that it was her blood in him that made Bran such a fool for climbing before his fall. She had died years and years and years before he was born, though, even before his father had been born.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nor did they. Only once did they encounter any of the mountain people, when a sudden burst of freezing rain sent them looking for shelter. Summer found it for them, sniffing out a shallow cave behind the greygreen branches of a towering sentinel tree, but when Hodor ducked beneath the stony overhang, Bran saw the orange glow of fire farther back and realized they were not alone. "Come in and warm yourselves," a man's voice called out. "There's stone enough to keep the rain off all our heads."</div>

He looked at Bran when he said that, and at Summer stretched out beside him. "As to that Wall," the man went on, "it's not a place that I'd be going. The Old Bear took the Watch into the haunted woods, and all that come back was his ravens, with hardly a message between them. Dark wings, dark words, me mother used to say, but when the birds fly silent, seems to me that's even darker." He poked at the fire with his stick.

<div class="line_en">They spent that night together, for the rain did not let up till well past dark, and only Summer seemed to want to leave the cave. When the fire had burned down to embers, Bran let him go. The direwolf did not feel the damp as people did, and the night was calling him. Moonlight painted the wet woods in shades of silver and turned the grey peaks white. Owls hooted through the dark and flew silently between the pines, while pale goats moved along the mountainsides. Bran closed his eyes and gave himself up to the wolf dream, to the smells and sounds of midnight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran lifted his head and saw it, its grey wings spread and still as it floated on the wind. He followed it with his eyes as it circled higher, wondering what it would be like to soar about the world so effortless. Better than climbing, even. He tried to reach the eagle, to leave his stupid crippled body and rise into the sky to join it, the way he joined with Summer. The greenseers could do it. I should be able to do it too. He tried and tried, until the eagle vanished in the golden haze of the afternoon. "It's gone," he said, disappointed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰抬头看去，只见那鹰展开灰色的翅膀，一动不动地乘风滑翔。他盯着它盘旋升高，一边疑惑地想：不知如此翱翔是怎样的滋味。会比攀爬的感觉更棒吗？他试图进入那只鹰，离开这愚蠢的残废身体，升到空中与它结合，就像跟夏天结合那样。绿先知能办到。我也能办到。他试了又试，直到那只鹰消失在下午金色的薄雾之中。“它不见了，”他失望地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The trail they followed was a little easier that day, and by noon the sun came breaking through the clouds. Bran sat in his basket up on Hodor's back and felt almost content.

<div class="line_en">"I'll remember," he promised. They climbed without speaking for a long time, following a crooked game trail over the high saddle between two stony peaks. Scrawny soldier pines clung to the slopes around them. Far ahead Bran could see the icy glitter of a stream where it tumbled down a mountainside.

Sometimes they were famous champions in disguise. The Dragonknight once won a tourney as the Knight of Tears, so he could name his sister the queen of love and beauty in place of the king's mistress. And Barristan the Bold twice donned a mystery knight's armor, the first time when he was only ten. "It was the little crannogman, I bet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰未卜先知地点点头。神秘骑士经常出现在竞技场上，用头盔掩盖面容，盾牌上要么是空白，要么就是大家都不认识的纹章。他们往往是由著名的勇士假扮的。龙骑士伊蒙曾以泪之骑士的身份赢得比武大会的胜利，以命名自己的妹妹为爱与美的皇后，取代国王的情妇。而无畏的巴利斯坦两度穿上神秘骑士的盔甲，第一次时才十岁。“这就是那小个子泽地人，我敢打赌。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No one knew," said Meera, "but the mystery knight was short of stature, and clad in ill-fitting armor made up of bits and pieces. The device upon his shield was a heart tree of the old gods, a white weirwood with a laughing red face."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没人知道，”梅拉说，“但那神秘骑士确实身材矮小，且穿着七拼八凑的盔甲，一点也不合体。他盾牌上画了一棵属于旧神的心树，那是一棵白色鱼梁木，上面有一张红色的笑脸。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe he came from the Isle of Faces," said Bran. "Was he green?" In Old Nan's stories, the guardians had dark green skin and leaves instead of hair. Sometimes they had antlers too, but Bran didn't see how the mystery knight could have worn a helm if he had antlers. "I bet the old gods sent him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许他来自于千面屿，”布兰猜测，“他是绿色的吗？”在老奶妈的故事中，这些守护者们个个有暗绿的皮肤，树叶代替了头发，甚至会长角，但布兰不知道那神秘骑士如果有角的话，还怎么戴头盔。“我敢打赌他是旧神派来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The porcupine knight, the pitchfork knight, and the knight of the twin towers." Bran had heard enough stories to know that. "He was the little crannogman, I told you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps they did. The mystery knight dipped his lance before the king and rode to the end of the lists, where the five champions had their pavilions. You know the three he challenged."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许是的。神秘骑士向国王行过礼，然后骑向比武场尽头，五名挑战者的帐篷就在那里。你知道他要向哪三个叫阵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Whoever he was, the old gods gave strength to his arm. The porcupine knight fell first, then the pitchfork knight, and lastly the knight of the two towers. None were well loved, so the common folk cheered lustily for the Knight of the Laughing Tree, as the new champion soon was called. When his fallen foes sought to ransom horse and armor, the Knight of the Laughing Tree spoke in a booming voice through his helm, saying, 'Teach your squire honor, that shall be ransom enough.' Once the defeated knights chastised their squires sharply, their horses and armor were returned. And so the little crannogman's prayer was answered… by the green men, or the old gods, or the children of the forest, who can say?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不管他是谁，旧神赐予他力量。豪猪骑士首先落马，接着是草叉骑士，最后是双塔骑士。他们都不受欢迎，因此当新的挑战者诞生时，围观的老百姓为这笑面树骑士热烈欢呼。他的手下败将们试图赎回马匹和盔甲，笑面树骑士透过头盔用洪亮的声音斥道：‘教你们的侍从懂得荣誉，把这当赎金就够了。’失败的骑士严惩了他们的侍从，马匹和盔甲便被交还。就这样，小个子泽地人的祈祷得到了回应…回应他的或许是绿人，或许是旧神，又或许是森林之子，谁说得准呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Meera. "That night at the great castle, the storm lord and the knight of skulls and kisses each swore they would unmask him, and the king himself urged men to challenge him, declaring that the face behind that helm was no friend of his. But the next morning, when the heralds blew their trumpets and the king took his seat, only two champions appeared. The Knight of the Laughing Tree had vanished. The king was wroth, and even sent his son the dragon prince to seek the man, but all they ever found was his painted shield, hanging abandoned in a tree. it was the dragon prince who won that tourney in the end."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”梅拉说，“当晚在大城堡里，风暴领主和头骨与亲吻骑士都发誓要挑开他的面甲，国王本人也鼓励人们向他挑战，他宣称藏在头盔后面的脸不会是他的朋友。但第二天早上，当传令官吹响号角，国王就座之后，只有两位挑战者出现。笑面树骑士竟消失了。国王异常愤怒，派他儿子龙太子去追，结果只找到一面挂在树上的彩绘盾牌。长枪比武继续进行，最后的赢家是龙太子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a good story, Bran decided after thinking about it a moment or two. "Then what happened? Did the Knight of the Laughing Tree win the tourney and marry a princess?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个好故事，布兰思考了一会儿之后断定。“后来呢？笑面树骑士有没赢得比武的胜利，并娶到一位公主？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh." Bran thought about the tale awhile. "That was a good story. But it should have been the three bad knights who hurt him, not their squires. Then the little crannogman could have killed them all. The part about the ransoms was stupid. And the mystery knight should win the tourney, defeating every challenger, and name the wolf maid the queen of love and beauty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”布兰思考了一会儿，“这是个好故事。不过伤害他的应该是那三个坏骑士，而不是他们的侍从，这样小个子泽地人就可以把他们都杀死了。关于赎金那部分很无聊。神秘骑士应该赢得比武大会的胜利，击败每一位挑战者，最后命名母狼为爱与美的皇后。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran shook his head. The day was growing old by then, and long shadows were creeping down the mountainsides to send black fingers through the pines. If the little crannogman could visit the Isle of Faces, maybe I could too. All the tales agreed that the green men had strange magic powers. Maybe they could help him walk again, even turn him into a knight. They turned the little crannogman into a knight, even if it was only for a day, he thought. A day would be enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰摇摇头。这时天色已晚，长长的影子爬下山坡，如黑色的手指一般穿过松林。既然小个子泽地人可以造访千面屿，或许我也行。看来所有的故事都有个共通点，那就是绿人确有神奇的魔力，他们也许能让我再次行走，甚至成为骑士呢。他们把小个子泽地人变成了骑士，即使只有一天，他心想，对我来说，一天就够了。">查看中文翻译</div>
