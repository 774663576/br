<div class="line_en">The next afternoon, I drove over to Gus's house and ate peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches with his parents and told them stories about Amsterdam while Gus napped on the living room couch, where we'd watched V for Vendetta. I could just see him from the kitchen: He lay on his back, head turned away from me, a PICC line already in. They were attacking the cancer with a new cocktail: two chemo drugs and a protein receptor that they hoped would turn off the oncogene in Gus's cancer. He was lucky to get enrolled in the trial, they told me. Lucky. I knew one of the drugs. Hearing the sound of its name made me want to barf.</div>

<div class="line_en">I drove. Augustus rode shotgun. Isaac sat in the back. We stopped at a grocery store, where, per Augustus's instruction, I bought a dozen eggs while he and Isaac waited in the car. And then Isaac guided us by his memory to Monica's house, an aggressively sterile, two-story house near the JCC. Monica's bright green 1990s Pontiac Firebird sat fat-wheeled in the driveway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开车，奥古斯塔斯坐在副驾驶座上，艾萨克坐后排。我们在一家杂货店门口停下，遵照奥古斯塔斯的指示，我下车买了一打鸡蛋，而他和艾萨克就坐在车里等我。然后，艾萨克凭记忆指路，带我们来到莫妮卡家，那是一座乏味得嚣张的两层楼房，就在犹太人社区中心旁边。莫妮卡那辆翠绿色宽轮距的九十年代款庞蒂亚克火鸟就趴在车道上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gus turned his head around slowly to look at Isaac. "Who cares where she is? This is not about her. This is about you." Gus gripped the egg carton in his lap, then opened the door and pulled his legs out onto the street. He opened the door for Isaac, and I watched through the mirror as Gus helped Isaac out of the car, the two of them leaning on each other at the shoulder then tapering away, like praying hands that don't quite meet at the palms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格斯慢慢地回过头去看着艾萨克。“谁管她在不在家？这事儿跟她无关，只跟你有关。”格斯抓起放在膝头的鸡蛋盒，打开车门，拖着两腿下车，走到街上。他帮艾萨克打开车门，我从反光镜里看着格斯把艾萨克扶下车，他们俩肩碰肩互相倚靠着，从肩往下又逐渐分开，就像祈祷时手掌并不完全合拢的双手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, you threw it like twenty feet over the car. Just, throw hard, but keep it low. And a little right of where you were last time." Isaac reached over and found an egg himself from the carton Gus cradled. He tossed it, hitting a taillight. "Yes!" Gus said. "Yes! TAILLIGHT!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。你扔到车那边了，差不多远了二十英尺。还是要用力扔，但要低些。另外，稍微再往右一点。”艾萨克侧身伸手从格斯捧着的蛋盒里拿了一个蛋，扔了出去，砸中了一盏尾灯。“对了！”格斯说，“中了！尾灯！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aim left." Isaac swiveled his shoulders. "Lefter," Gus said. Isaac swiveled again. "Yes. Excellent. And throw hard." Gus handed him another egg, and Isaac hurled it, the egg arcing over the car and smashing against the slow-sloping roof of the house. "Bull's-eye!" Gus said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“偏左一点瞄准。”艾萨克抡圆了胳膊。“再左一点。”艾萨克又抡了一次。“对了，非常好。这次用力扔。”格斯再递给他一个鸡蛋，艾萨克扔了出去，那个蛋画出一道长长的弧线，从车顶上飞过去，砸在房子平缓的屋顶上摔得稀烂。“正中靶心！”格斯说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I rolled down the windows and watched from the car, because vandalism made me nervous. They took a few steps toward the car, then Gus flipped open the egg carton and handed Isaac an egg. Isaac tossed it, missing the car by a solid forty feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Isaac reached for another egg, missed wide right, then another, missing low, then another, hitting the back windshield. He then nailed three in a row against the trunk. "Hazel Grace," Gus shouted back to me. "Take a picture of this so Isaac can see it when they invent robot eyes." I pulled myself up so I was sitting in the rolled-down window, my elbows on the roof of the car, and snapped a picture with my phone: Augustus, an unlit cigarette in his mouth, his smile deliciously crooked, holds the mostly empty pink egg carton above his head. His other hand is draped around Isaac's shoulder, whose sunglasses are turned not quite toward the camera. Behind them, egg yolks drip down the windshield and bumper of the green Firebird. And behind that, a door is opening.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ma'am," Augustus said, nodding toward her, "your daughter's car has just been deservedly egged by a blind man. Please close the door and go back inside or we'll be forced to call the police." After wavering for a moment, Monica's mom closed the door and disappeared. Isaac threw the last three eggs in quick succession and Gus then guided him back toward the car. "See, Isaac, if you just take -- we're coming to the curb now -- the feeling of legitimacy away from them, if you turn it around so they feel like they are committing a crime by watching -- a few more steps -- their cars get egged, they'll be confused and scared and worried and they'll just return to their -- you'll find the door handle directly in front of you -- quietly desperate lives." Gus hurried around the front of the car and installed himself in the shotgun seat. The doors closed, and I roared off, driving for several hundred feet before I realized I was headed down a dead-end street. I circled the cul-de-sac and raced back past Monica's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，”奥古斯塔斯对她点点头说，“您女儿的车刚被一位盲人扔了鸡蛋，这是咎由自取。请您关上门，回到屋里去，否则我们就要被迫报警了。”踌躇片刻之后，莫妮卡的妈妈关上门，消失了。艾萨克飞快地把剩下三个鸡蛋一连串扔了出去，然后格斯领着他回车上。“瞧，艾萨克，你只要——我们现在走到马路牙子了——你只要把正当合法的感觉从他们身上剥夺，只要把事情颠倒，让他们觉得在那儿旁观自己的车被扔鸡蛋才是犯罪——再走几步——他们就会迷惑、害怕、担心，他们就会回到——车门把手就在你面前——回到自己绝望得无声无息的生活里去。”说完这番话，格斯匆匆绕过车前，把自己塞进副驾驶座。车门关上了，我发动汽车，咆哮着开出几百英尺后，我发现自己正冲一条死胡同而去。我赶紧掉头，再次从莫妮卡家门口飞速驶离。">查看中文翻译</div>
