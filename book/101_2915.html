<div class="line_en">Leslie was still dressed in the faded cutoffs and the blue undershirt. She had sneakers on her feet but no socks. Surprise swooshed up from the class like steam from a released radiator cap. They were all sitting there primly dressed in their spring Sunday best. Even Jess wore his one pair of corduroys and an ironed shirt.</div>

<div class="line_en">The reaction didn't seem to bother her. She stood there in front, her eyes saying, "OK, friends, here I am," in answer to their openmouthed stares while Mrs. Myers fluttered about trying to figure where to put the extra desk. The room was a small basement one, and five rows of six desks already filled it more than comfortably.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thirty pairs of eyes were suddenly focused on desktop scratches. Jess ran his forefinger around the heart with two pairs of initials, BR + SK, trying to figure out whose desk he had inherited. Probably Sally Koch's. Girls did more of the heart stuff in fifth grade than boys. Besides BR must be Billy Rudd, and Billy was known to favor Myrna Hauser last spring. Of course, these initials might have been here longer than that, in which case…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="31双眼睛突然都聚焦在桌面的划痕上。杰斯用食指在胸前比划着两对缩写字母——BR+SK，试着猜出他继承的是谁的桌子。或许是莎莉·科赫的。五年级的女孩比男孩更爱耍心眼。而BR一定是比利·鲁德，而众所周知去年春天的时候，比利喜欢莫娜·郝泽。当然，这个缩写也许早在此之前就在课桌上了，在这种情况下……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leslie waited quietly until the seventh-grade boy who'd been sent down with the extra desk scraped it into position hard against the radiator and under the first window. Without making any noise, she pulled it a few inches forward from the radiator and settled herself into it. Then she turned once more to gaze at the rest of the class.</div>

<div class="line_en">He slapped the books down as Mrs. Myers directed. Gary Fulcher grabbed his arm as he went by. "Gonna run today?" Jess nodded. Gary smirked. He thinks he can beat me, the dumbhead. At the thought, something jiggled inside Jess. He knew he was better than he had been last spring. Fulcher might think he was going to be the best, now that Wayne Pettis was in sixth, but he, Jess, planned to give old Fulcher a le-etle surprise come noon. It was as though he had swallowed grasshoppers. He could hardly wait.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把本子直接交到梅耶斯夫人的手里。当杰斯经过加里·富尔彻的座位时，富尔彻抓住了他的胳膊。“今天去不去赛跑？”杰斯点了点头。加里得意地笑了。他以为他能打败我，这个傻瓜。这么想着的时候，杰斯感到体内有某种东西蠢蠢欲动。杰斯心里明白他要比上个春天的时候还要强。富尔彻也许认为他将要成为最厉害的，因为韦恩·佩提斯已经上六年级了，但是他，杰斯，计划很快就要给老富尔彻一个惊喜。就好像心里有一头小鹿乱撞。他已经等不及了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Myers handed out books almost as though she were President of the United States, dragging the distribution process out in senseless signings and ceremonies. It occurred to Jess that she, too, wished to postpone regular school as long as possible. When it wasn't his turn to pass out books, Jess sneaked out a piece of notebook paper and drew. He was toying with the idea of doing a whole book of drawings. He ought to choose one chief character and do a story about it. He scribbled several animals and tried to think of a name. A good title would get him started. The Haunted Hippo? He liked the ring of it. Herby the Haunted Hippo? Even better. The Case of the Crooked Crocodile. Not bad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅耶斯夫人慢慢地拿出课本就好像她是美国总统，想方设法地把无聊的演讲和什么仪式给延长。杰斯忽然想到，她的确希望正常的学期能尽可能地延长。当没有轮到他分发课本时，他就偷偷的抽出一页笔记本的纸开始画画。他在酝酿着一个画满整个本子的想法。他应该为他的画选一个主角，然后编一个关于他的故事。他胡乱画了一些动物并试着给主角起个名字。一个好的标题能帮他开个好头。缺心眼的河马？他喜欢这种感觉。长草的缺心眼河马？这个更好。鳄鱼骗子的故事？也不赖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jess roused himself and went to the front. As he passed Leslie's desk, she grinned and rippled her fingers low in a kind of wave. He jerked a nod. He couldn't help feeling sorry for her. It must be embarrassing to sit in front when you find yourself dressed funny on the first day of school. And you don't know anybody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰斯回过神来往讲台走去。当他经过莱斯利的桌子时，她露齿而笑，轻轻地向他挥动手指。他急忙点了一下头。忍不住为她感到遗憾。当你在开学的第一天穿着滑稽的衣服坐在教室前排，一定会让人感到难为情。而且这些人你都不认识。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You ain't scared to let a girl race are you, Fulcher?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不会害怕跟一个女孩比赛吧，富尔彻？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure." She was grinning. "Why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然。”她笑着，“为什么不能？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can run with the fours, Leslie." He said it loudly enough to make sure Fulcher could hear him and then concentrated on the runners. See, he told himself, you can stand up to a creep like Fulcher. No sweat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可以跟着第四组跑，莱斯利。”他大声说着以便能让富尔彻听到，然后继续关注跑道上的选手们。看吧，他对自己说，你也可以勇敢地面对富尔彻那样的混混。毫不费力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bobby Miller won the threes easily. He was the best of the fourth graders, almost as fast as Fulcher. But not as good as me, Jess thought. He was beginning to get really excited now. There wasn't anybody in the fours who could give him much of a race. Still it would be better to give Fulcher a scare by running well in the heat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲍比·米勒很轻松地赢了第三组的比赛。他是四年级中最棒的，几乎和富尔彻跑得一样快，但跟我还是有点差距，杰斯这么想着。他先在真正地开始兴奋起来了。第四组中还没有什么人能给他带来威胁。不过他最好还是尽力在小组赛中跑得好些，来给富尔彻一个下马威。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a minute he thought Gary was going to sock him, and he stiffened. He mustn't let Fulcher suspect that he was scared of a little belt in the mouth. But instead Gary broke into a trot and started bossing the threes into line for their heat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来杰斯认为加里会反击他，而他又会加倍奉还。他不能让加里觉得他会害怕口头威吓。但是相反，加里小跑到起点，开始组织第三组小组赛站队。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leslie lined up beside him on the right. He moved a tiny bit to the left, but she didn't seem to notice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这场比赛中莱斯利站在他的右边。杰斯悄悄得往左边移开了一点，但她似乎没有察觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the bang Jess shot forward. It felt good -- even the rough ground against the bottom of his worn sneakers. He was pumping good. He could almost smell Gary Fulcher's surprise at his improvement. The crowd was noisier than they'd been during the other heats. Maybe they were all noticing. He wanted to look back and see where the others were, but he resisted the temptation. It would seem conceited to look back. He concentrated on the line ahead. It was nearing with every step. "Oh, Miss Bessie, if you could see me now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声“梆”发出，杰斯向前冲了出去。他感觉非常好——即便自己穿着破烂的运动鞋踩在这种粗糙的路面上。起跑得灵动自如。他几乎能闻到加里·富尔彻对自己的进步产生的惊讶。周围的人群比其它组比赛时都要喧闹。也许他们都在注意到了。他想回头看看别人离自己有多远，但他还是打消了这个念头。如果回头看了会被别人认为是自以为是的家伙。他把注意力集中在终点线上，它在一步步地接近。“噢，贝茜小姐，如果你现在能看到我就好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He felt it before he saw it. Someone was moving up. He automatically pumped harder. Then the shape was there in his sideways vision. Then suddenly pulling ahead. He forced himself now. His breath was choking him, and the sweat was in his eyes. But he saw the figure anyhow. The faded cutoffs crossed the line a full three feet ahead of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他看到之前就有所感觉。有人追上来了。他自然而然地使劲加速。然后那个人的轮廓显现在他的余光中。于是他突然领先了。他现在是在硬着头皮跑，呼吸变得困难，眼角也渗出了汗水。但他终究还是看到了那人的身影。穿着褪色短裤的家伙足足领先他三英尺率先冲线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leslie turned to face him with a wide smile on her tanned face. He stumbled and without a word began half walking, half trotting over to the starting line. This was the day he was going to be champion -- the best runner of the fourth and fifth grades, and he hadn't even won his heat. There was no cheering at either end of the field. The rest of the boys seemed as stunned as he. The teasing would come later, he felt sure, but at least for the moment none of them were talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱斯利转过身，她那被晒过的脸上露出一个大大的微笑。他一言不发，连走带跑磕磕绊绊地回到起点。今天本该是他赢得冠军的一天——四、五年级跑得最快的人，但他甚至连小组赛都没赢。跑道两边没有一点欢呼声。男孩们全都像他一样目瞪口呆。他们晚些时候会嘲笑他的，他很肯定，但至少现在他们没有一个人在讲话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"OK." Fulcher took over. He tried to appear very much in charge. "OK, you guys. You can line up for the finals." He walked over to Leslie. "OK, you had your fun. You can run on up to the hopscotch now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。”富尔彻打破了沉默。他总想表现出掌控一切的样子。“好了，你们入围决赛的排成一条线吧。”他走向莱斯利，“嗯…你已经找到乐子了。现在你可以跑回去玩“跳房子”游戏了。“">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She beat him. She came in first and turned her large shining eyes on a bunch of dumb sweating-mad faces. The bell rang. Jess started across the lower field, his hands still deep in his pockets. She caught up with him. He took his hands out and began to trot toward the hill. She'd got him into enough trouble.

<div class="line_en">On the bus that afternoon he did something he had never thought he would do. He sat down beside May Belle. It was the only way he could make sure that he wouldn't have Leslie plunking herself down beside him. Lord, the girl had no notion of what you did and didn't do. He stared out the window, but he knew she had come and was sitting across the aisle from them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午放学后的校车上，他做了一件从未想过他会做的事。他坐在了梅宝旁边。这是唯一可以确保莱斯利不会坐在他旁边的办法。老天，这个女孩对你这么做的意图完全不理解。他凝望着窗外，但他知道莱斯利已经来了，并且坐在了过道对面的位子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He heard her say "Jess" once, but the bus was noisy enough that he could pretend he hadn't heard. When they came to the stop, he grabbed May Belle's hand and dragged her off, conscious that Leslie was right behind them. But she didn't try to speak to him again, nor did she follow them. She just took off running to the old Perkins place. He couldn't help turning to watch. She ran as though it was her nature. It reminded him of the flight of wild ducks in the autumn. So smooth. The word "beautiful" came to his mind, but he shook it away and hurried up toward the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听到她叫了一声“杰斯”，但因为车里实在太吵了，所有他就可以假装没听到。当他们到站的时候，杰斯拉着梅宝的手拖着她走，他觉察到莱斯利就在他们后边。但她没有再尝试跟他说话，也没跟着他们。她只是开始跑向帕金斯老宅。他忍不住扭头去看。跑步就像她的天性一样。这场景让他想起了秋天飞翔的野鸭子。多么流畅！“美”这个词浮现在他的脑海，但他立刻把这念头赶走然后急忙向家里走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
