<div class="line_en">When the Captains were but two days gone, the Lady Éowyn bade the women who tended her to bring her raiment, and she would not be gainsaid, but rose; and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen, she went to the Warden of the Houses of Healing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the city of Gondor doubt and great dread had hung. Fair weather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days held little hope, and who looked each morning for news of doom. Their lord was dead and burned, dead lay the King of Rohan in their citadel, and the new king that had come to them in the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark and terrible for any might or valour to conquer. And no news came. After the host left Morgul Vale and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding East.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚铎全城都处在恐惧和疑虑中，晴朗的天空似乎只是对绝望的人们嘲笑，他们每天清晨都无奈的等着噩耗传来。他们的王上被烧成焦炭，洛汗国的骠骑王尸体正在要塞中。曾经在夜晚造访此城的人皇又再度出战，去面对那没有任何力量或是武勇足以抗衡的黑暗，而且，毫无音讯。在部队离开了魔窟谷，往北进入山区之后，就再也没有任何的流言和信差，将消息带出那阴沉的东方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am healed," she said, "healed at least in body, save my left arm only, and that is at ease. But I shall sicken anew, if there is naught that I can do. Are there no tidings of war? The women can tell me nothing."</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are no tidings," said the Warden, "save that the Lords have ridden to Morgul Vale; and men say that the new captain out of the North is their chief. A great lord is that, and a healer; and it is a thing passing strange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword. It is not thus in Gondor now, though once it was so, if old tales be true. But for long years we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of swords. Though we should still have enough to do without them: the world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有任何的消息，”院长说：“我们只知道部队已经离开了魔窟谷，人们说那个从北方来的人是他们的总帅。他的确是个很尊贵的王者，也是个医者；我实在很难理解，为什么医人的手也要拿剑呢？刚铎现在没有这种人，但如果古老的传说是真实的，或许过去曾经有这样的角色。许多许多年以来，我们这些医者都只想着要怎么缝补被刀剑所弄出的伤口，即使没有战争，我们也没有任何休息；就算世界和平，这世间还是有许多的病痛需要我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It needs but one foe to breed a war, not two, Master Warden," answered Éowyn. "And those who have not swords can still die upon them. Would you have the folk of Gondor gather you herbs only, when the Dark Lord gathers armies? And it is not always good to be healed in body. Nor is it always evil to die in battle, even in bitter pain. Were I permitted, in this dark hour I would choose the latter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只要对方有敌意，战火马上就会被点燃，院长大人，”伊欧玟回答道：“没有刀剑的人还是可能死在刀剑之下。难道当黑暗魔君集结大军时，你觉得刚铎的人民应该出去收集药草？就算身体治好了，也不见得会带来幸福；即使痛苦的战死沙场，也不见得总是不幸。在这黑暗的时刻，如果能够的话，我宁愿选择后者。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At a sign from Faramir, the Warden bowed and departed. "What would you have me do, lady?" said Faramir. "I also am a prisoner of the healers." He looked at her, and being a man whom pity deeply stirred, it seemed to him that her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart. And she looked at him and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred among men of war, that here was one whom no Rider of the Mark would outmatch in battle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法拉墨比了个手势，院长行礼之后就离开了。“王女，你觉得我能怎么办？”法拉墨说：“我同样也是医生的俘虏。”法拉墨看着她，在同情心的强烈加温下，他觉得对方美丽和哀伤交杂的气质让他心痛不已。她看着他，从他的眼中看到那沉重的温柔；但是，由于她自小在骠骑群中长大，伊欧玟也明白，眼前的男子没有任何骠骑在战场上能够抵挡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do not misunderstand him, lord," said Éowyn. "It is not lack of care that grieves me. No houses could be fairer, for those who desire to be healed. But I cannot lie in sloth, idle, caged. I looked for death in battle. But I have not died, and battle still goes on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大人，不要误会他了，”伊欧玟说：“我不满的不是照顾不周，对于想要疗养的人来说，没有别处可以比得上这里。但是，我不能躺在病床上，整日无所事事的被囚禁在这里。我想要战死沙场，但我没有如愿以偿，而世间的战火却还未熄灭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would have you command this Warden, and bid him let me go," she said; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered, and for the first time she doubted herself.

<div class="line_en">She did not answer, but as he looked at her it seemed to him that something in her softened, as though a bitter frost were yielding at the first faint presage of spring. A tear sprang in her eye and fell down her cheek, like a glistening rain-drop. Her proud head drooped a little. Then quietly, more as if speaking to herself than to him: "But the healers would have me lie abed seven days yet," she said. "And my window does not look eastward." Her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有回答，不过，法拉墨可以看出来她心中有某种东西软化了，似乎是冰霜在早春的太阳下融解了。她的眼角落下一滴泪水，如同雨滴般挂在脸颊上。她自信的面孔稍稍低了下去，然后，她小声的，彷佛是在对自己说话：“可是医生还要让我再躺七天，”她说，“我的窗户又不是朝向东方。”她的声音听起来像是一名哀伤的少女。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But in the morning, as Faramir came from the Houses, he saw her, as she stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun. And he called to her, and she came down, and they walked on the grass or sat under a green tree together, now in silence, now in speech. And each day after they did likewise. And the Warden looking from his window was glad in heart, for he was a healer, and his care was lightened; and certain it was that, heavy as was the dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of men, still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，第二天一早，当法拉墨离开房间时，他看见了站在城墙上的她。她一身雪白，在阳光中让人难以逼视。他唤了一声，她就走了下来，两人并肩在草地上漫步，或是坐在树下聊天。院长从窗户窥探着，心中感到非常的高兴。毕竟，他是一名医者，明白有些事情比药石都还适合治疗人们的内心；而且，即使在这局势动汤的黑暗年代，能够看见有美好的事物，随着时光流逝而不停的滋长，也让人觉得十分高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks, and over all the Lady Éowyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer-night, and it was set with silver stars about hem and throat. Faramir had sent for this robe and had wrapped it about her; and he thought that she looked fair and queenly indeed as she stood there at his side. The mantle was wrought for his mother, Finduilas of Amroth, who died untimely, and was to him but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief; and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of Éowyn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们穿着保暖的衣物和厚重的斗篷，伊欧玟一整天都穿着深蓝色的披风，在领口和下摆点缀着星辰。这是法拉墨送给她的衣服，他觉得这衣服让她看起来非常美丽和尊贵，特别是当她站在他身边的时候。这件披风是织给他母亲，安罗斯的芬朵拉斯所穿的。早逝的母亲对法拉墨来说只剩下一个模糊的影子，但也是他这辈子第一次感到哀伤的时刻。对他来说，母亲的袍子十分适合美丽而哀伤的伊欧玟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so the fifth day came since the Lady Éowyn went first to Faramir; and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the City and looked out. No tidings had yet come, and all hearts were darkened. The weather, too, was bright no longer. It was cold. A wind that had sprung up in the night was blowing now keenly from the North, and it was rising; but the lands about looked grey and drear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，这是王女伊欧玟第一次见到法拉墨之后的第五天。两人又再一次的站在城墙上，看着远方。部队依旧没有任何的消息，所有的人都觉得心情低落。天色也不再晴朗，天气很冷，夜里渐渐增强的北风吹抚着大地，大地看起来一片苍茫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Turn your face from the green world, and look where all seems barren and cold!" said Gandalf.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Aragorn cried: "Yé! utúvienyes! I have found it! Lo! here is a scion of the Eldest of Trees! But how comes it here? For it is not itself yet seven years old."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚拉冈大呼一声：“Yé！ utúvienyes！我找到了！啊！这是那最古老圣树的幼苗！它怎么会来到这里？它看来才不过生长了七年左右。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Aragorn turned, and there was a stony slope behind him running down from the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he was aware that alone there in the waste a growing thing stood. And he climbed to it, and saw that out of the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no more than three foot high. Already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely, dark above and silver beneath, and upon its slender crown it bore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚拉冈转过头，眼前是积雪覆盖之下的山坡；当他仔细看去，他才发现在这一片荒芜中，有一样生机蓬勃的事物。当他越走越近时，发现就在积雪的边缘，有株不过三尺高的小树，它已经冒出了长而优雅的树叶，在它的顶冠上有许多白色的花朵，像是在阳光下的积雪一般反射着光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Gandalf coming looked at it, and said: "Verily this is a sapling of the line of Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and that a fruit of Telperion of many names, Eldest of Trees. Who shall say how it comes here in the appointed hour? But this is an ancient hallow, and ere the kings failed or the Tree withered in the court, a fruit must have been set here. For it is said that, though the fruit of the Tree comes seldom to ripeness, yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many long years, and none can foretell the time in which it will awake. Remember this. For if ever a fruit ripens, it should be planted, lest the line die out of the world. Here it has lain hidden on the mountain, even as the race of Elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the North. Yet the line of Nimloth is older far than your line, King Elessar."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫走到他身边，说道：“这的确是美丽的圣树之子嗣，它是世间仅存的一株，树中之王。谁知道它怎么会在这时候出现在这里？这是个古老的地方，在王者消失、庭园中的圣树枯萎之前，或许有人将果实带到此地。根据传说，圣树极少结果，但它们的果实却都可以休眠许多年，没有人知道它什么时候会再度苏醒。记住，如果它再度结果，请你将它种下，不要再让圣树的传承断绝。它一直隐藏在山中，就像伊兰迪尔的子嗣躲藏在北方的荒原中一样。但是，人皇伊力萨，圣树宁罗斯的传承可比你的家谱要悠久多了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The sign has been given," said Aragorn, "and the day is not far off." And he set watchmen upon the walls.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling, and lo! it seemed to hold only lightly to the earth, and it was removed without hurt; and Aragorn bore it back to the Citadel. Then the withered tree was uprooted, but with reverence; and they did not burn it, but laid it to rest in the silence of Rath Dínen. And Aragorn planted the new tree in the court by the fountain, and swiftly and gladly it began to grow; and when the month of June entered in it was laden with blossom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚拉冈轻柔地碰触那小树，看哪！它似乎扎根并不深，一下子就离开了土地。亚拉冈小心翼翼地呵护着它回到要塞中，枯萎的老树被呵护地挖起，他们并不将它烧毁，而是让他和众王们一起安息在拉斯迪南。亚拉冈将新树在喷泉旁种下，它高兴地开始生长，等到六月时，它已经开满了花朵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the day before Midsummer when messengers came from Amon Dîn to the City, and they said that there was a riding of fair folk out of the North, and they drew near now to the walls of the Pelennor. And the King said: "At last they have come. Let all the City be made ready!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Upon the very Eve of Midsummer, when the sky was blue as sapphire and white stars opened in the East, but the West was still golden, and the air was cool and fragrant, the riders came down the North-way to the gates of Minas Tirith. First rode Elrohir and Elladan with a banner of silver, and then came Glorfindel and Erestor and all the household of Rivendell, and after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn, Lord of Lothlórien, riding upon white steeds and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked with white gems in their hair; and last came Master Elrond, mighty among Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Annúminas, and beside him upon a grey palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那夏至前夕，当天空澄蓝得如同宝石一般，白色的星辰在东方闪烁时，西方依旧金黄一片，清凉的空气中充满了芬芳，骑士们终于来到了米那斯提力斯的门前。伊罗何和伊莱丹拿着银色的旗帜一马当先，然后是葛罗芬戴尔以及伊瑞斯特和瑞文戴尔的所有居民。紧接在后的是凯兰崔尔女皇和罗斯洛立安之王塞勒鹏，他们骑着白马，率领着许多美丽的子民一同前来，这些精灵披着灰色的斗篷，发间镶着美钻；最后，则是精灵和人类之中独一无二的爱隆，他手中拿着阿努米那斯的权杖，在他身边则是一匹灰色骏马，上面载着他的女儿亚玟，同胞眼中的暮星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to Gandalf: "At last I understand why we have waited! This is the ending. Now not day only shall be beloved, but night too shall be beautiful and blessed and all its fear pass away!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the King welcomed his guests, and they alighted; and Elrond surrendered the sceptre, and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of the King, and together they went up into the High City, and all the stars flowered in the sky. And Aragorn the King Elessar wedded Arwen Undómiel in the City of the Kings upon the day of Midsummer, and the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilment.</div>
