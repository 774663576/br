<div class="line_en">Her girl friends, whom I had looked forward to meet, proved on the whole disappointing. There was Opal Something, and Linda Hall, and Avis Chapman, and Eva Rosen, and Mona Dahl (save one, all these names are approximations, of course). Opal was a bashful, formless, bespectacled, bepimpled creature who doted on Dolly who bullied her. With Linda Hall the school tennis champion, Dolly played singles at least twice a week: I suspect Linda was a true nymphet, but for some unknown reason she did not come -- was perhaps not allowed to come -- to our house; so I recall her only as a flash of natural sunshine on an indoor court. Of the rest, none had any claims to nymphetry except Eva Rosen. Avis was a plump lateral child with hairy legs, while Mona, though handsome in a coarse sensual way and only a year older than my aging mistress, had obviously long ceased to be a nymphet, if she ever had been one. Eva Rosen, a displaced little person from France, was on the other hand a good example of a not strikingly beautiful child revealing to the perspicacious amateur some of the basic elements of nymphet charm, such as a perfect pubescent figure and lingering eyes and high cheekbones. Her glossy copper hair had Lolita's silkiness, and the features of her delicate milky-white face with pink lips and silver fish eyelashes were less foxy than those of her likes -- the great clan of intra-racial redheads; nor did she sport their green uniform but wore, as I remember her, a lot of black or cherry dark -- a very smart black pullover, for instance, and high-heeled black shoes, and garnet-red fingernail polish. I spoke French to her (much to Lo's disgust). The child's tonalities were still admirably pure, but for school words and play words she resorted to current American and then a slight Brooklyn accent would crop up in her speech, which was amusing in a little Parisian who went to a select New England school with phoney British aspirations. Unfortunately, despite "that French kid's uncle" being "a millionaire," Lo dropped Eva for some reason before I had had time to enjoy in my modest way her fragrant presence in the Humbert open house. The reader knows what importance I attached to having a bevy of page girls, consolation prize nymphets, around my Lolita. For a while, I endeavored to interest my senses in Mona Dahl who was a good deal around, especially during the spring term when Lo and she got so enthusiastic about dramatics. I have often wondered what secrets outrageously treacherous Dolores Haze had imparted to Mona while blurting out to me by urgent and well-paid request various really incredible details concerning an affair that Mona had had with a marine at the seaside. It was characteristic of Lo that she chose for her closest chum that elegant, cold, lascivious, experienced young female whom I once heard (misheard, Lo swore) cheerfully say in the hallway to Lo -- who had remarked that her (Lo's) sweater was of virgin wool: "The only thing about you that is, kiddo…" She had a curiously husky voice, artificially waved dull dark hair, earrings, amber-brown prominent eyes and luscious lips. Lo said teachers had remonstrated with her on her loading herself with so much costume jewelry. Her hands trembled. She was burdened with a 150 I. Q. And I also know she had a tremendous chocolate-brown mole on her womanish back which I inspected the night Lo and she had worn low-cut pastel-colored, vaporous dresses for a dance at the Butler Academy.</div>

<div class="line_en">How had the ball been? Oh, it had been a riot. A what? A panic. Terrific, in a word. Had Lo danced a lot? Oh, not a frightful lot, just as much as she could stand. What did she, languorous Mona, think of Lo? Sir? Did she think Lo was doing well at school? Gosh, she certainly was quite a kid. But her general behavior was --? Oh, she was a swell kid. But still? "Oh, she's a doll," concluded Mona, and sighed abruptly, and picked up a book that happened to lie at hand, and with a change of expression, falsely furrowing her brow, inquired: "Do tell me about Ball Zack, sir. Is he really that good?" She moved up so close to my chair that I made out through lotions and creams her uninteresting skin scent. A sudden odd thought stabbed me: was my Lo playing the pimp? If so, she had found the wrong substitute. Avoiding Mona's cool gaze, I talked literature for a minute. Then Dolly arrived -- and slit her pale eyes at us. I left the two friends to their own devices. One of the latticed squares in a small cobwebby casement window at the turn of the staircase was glazed with ruby, and that raw wound among the unstained rectangles and its asymmetrical position -- a knight's move from the top -- always strangely disturbed me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那舞会怎么样？噢，是次大暴动。是次什么？是次恐慌。总知，很可怕。洛跳了很多么？噢，不太吓人，只是能跳多少就跳了多少。她，郁闷的莫娜，怎么想洛？什么先生？她认为洛在学校表现好吗？啊，她还是个小孩子。但她的一般表现——？噢，她很棒。可是她？“噢，她是个小乖乖。”莫娜下了这结论，又突然叹息一声，摘起手边的一本书，故意改变表情，皱起额头，问道：“对我说说鲍尔·扎克吧，先生。他真地那么出色吗？”她把椅子向我挪来，那么近，我透过洗浴液和奶蜜油脂嗅出了她皮肤的芳香，但那令人兴味索然；猛地一个奇异的念头刺伤了我：我的洛是不是在充当拉皮条的角色？如果是这样，她就找错了对象。避开莫娜冰凉的目光，我讲了一会文学。不久多丽回来了——眯起眼睛看我们。我听任这两个朋友去自由捣鬼。楼梯拐角处一扇爬满蜘蛛的门或小窗，闪着红宝石色的光，而在一尘不染的长方形和它不对称的位置中间皮开肉绽的伤疼———一名骑士从上面走过——总是奇怪地扰乱我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am anticipating a little, but I cannot help running my memory all over the keyboard of that school year. In meeting my attempts to find out what kind of boys Lo knew, Miss Dahl was elegantly evasive. Lo who had gone to play tennis at Linda's country club had telephoned she might be a full half hour late, and so, would I entertain Mona who was coming to practice with her a scene from The Taming of the Shrew. Using all the modulations, all the allure of manner and voice she was capable of and staring at me with perhaps -- could I be mistaken?-- a faint gleam of crystalline irony, beautiful Mona replied: "Well, sir, the fact is Dolly is not much concerned with mere boys. Fact is, we are rivals. She and I have a crush on the Reverend Rigger." (This was a joke -- I have already mentioned that gloomy giant of a man, with the jaw of a horse: he was to bore me to near murder with his impressions of Switzerland at a tea party for parents that I am unable to place correctly in terms of time.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我现在要讲那年上学的事是早了一点儿，不过这是我的回忆不由自主跳到此键盘上的。我很想了解洛都知道些什么男孩，但对此达尔小姐始终在优雅地回避着。洛去林达的乡间俱乐部打网球，打电话说地可能要晚半个小时回家，如此问我能否招待一下来找她练习《驯悍记》一慕戏的莫娜。她施展出各种柔和音调，各种带诱惑的风度盯着我，或许还带着——我会误会吗？——一线微弱的讥讽，美丽的莫娜答道：“好吧，先生，事实上多丽对男孩子并不怎么关心。事实是，我们是情敌，她和我都迷恋里格牧师。”（这是开玩笑——我已经提到个那个阴沉的大力士，有一张马下巴：在一次家长茶话会上，他讲起对瑞士的印象，让我烦得直想杀他；只是我不知该把那次茶话会安置在时间顺序的什么位置上。）">查看中文翻译</div>
