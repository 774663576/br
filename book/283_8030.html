<div class="line_en">Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈丽特·史密斯很快就跟哈特菲尔德建立了密切的关系。爱玛办事利索果断，当即邀请她，鼓励她，要她常来她家玩。两人渐渐熟识起来，彼此也就感到越发满意。爱玛早就预见到，哈丽特作为散步的伙伴，可以发挥很大的作用。韦斯顿太太走后，她在这方面蒙受了很大的损失。父亲散步顶多走到灌木丛，随着季节的变更，不管距离长短，那里有两块空地，足够他散步的了。所以，自韦斯顿太太结婚以后，爱玛的活动受到了很大的限制。有一次，她一个人愣闯到了兰多尔斯，可滋味并不好受。因此，如今有了个哈丽特·史密斯，想散步了可以随时喊上她，倒给她又增添了一个宝贵的有利条件。不过，随着接触的增多，她发现哈丽特各方面都好，也就越发坚信她的全盘计划。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth. Harriet had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她施展本领的第一个尝试，是查询谁是哈丽特的父母亲，可惜哈丽特闹不清楚。她知道的事情总是愿意爽然相告，但是在这个问题上，你再问也是白搭。爱玛不得不随心所欲地发挥想象，可她说什么也不肯相信，要是处在同样的情况下，她居然会搞不出个水落石出。哈丽特缺乏洞察力，戈达德太太跟她说什么，她就听什么、信什么，从不追根究底。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having `two parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink tea: -- a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈丽特的谈话内容，自然主要是戈达德太太、老师和同学，以及学校的各种事情——若不是幸亏她认识阿比一米尔农庄的马丁一家，那她也只能谈谈学校的事了。不过，她心里经常想着马丁一家人。她曾在他们家度过了十分愉快的两个月，如今就喜欢谈论做客时的种种乐趣，描绘他们家有多么舒适，多么好玩。爱玛激励她滔滔不绝地讲下去——听她绘声绘色地讲起另一阶层的人，觉得倒蛮有意思的，见她兴高采烈地讲起马丁太太家，那个天真活泼的样子，也很讨人喜欢。哈丽特说：“马丁太太家有两间客厅，真是两个好棒的客厅。有一间跟戈达德太太家的一样大。她有一个上等女仆，在她家住了二十五年。她家有八头奶牛，两头是奥尔德尼种，一头韦尔奇小奶牛，真是一头好漂亮的韦尔奇小奶牛。马丁太太好喜欢它，说是应该称它为‘她的’奶牛。她家的花园里造了一座好漂亮的凉亭，明年哪一天，他们全家人要去那里喝茶。一座好漂亮的凉亭，坐得下十二个人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she wanted him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="心里这么一警觉，她的问题增多了，意味也增强了。她特意诱导哈丽特再谈谈马丁先生，哈丽特显然也很乐意谈。她欣然说起了他跟她们一起在月下散过步，玩过一些快活的游戏，大讲特讲他脾气如何好，多会体贴人。“有一天，就因为我说了声爱吃核桃，他便跑了三英里，给我弄了一些来。不管什么事，他都这么热心！有天晚上，他把他家牧羊人的儿子叫到客厅，唱歌给我听。我非常喜欢唱歌。他自己也会唱一点。我觉得他很聪明，什么都懂。他养了一群好棒的羊。我在他家时，他的羊毛卖出的价钱，比乡下哪个人的都高。我想大家都说他好。他母亲和两个妹妹都很喜欢他。有一天，马丁太太对我说，她说着脸就红了，“天底下没有比他更强的儿子了，因此她敢说，他要是结了婚，一定会是个好丈夫。倒不是做母亲的想要他结婚，她可一点也不着急。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛一时只顾得高兴，除了听她讲以外，没往深里去考虑。不过，等她深入了解了这家人之后，她心里犯起嘀咕来。她起先转错了念头，以为这家人是母女俩和儿子、儿媳住在一起。后来才发现，哈丽特一再提到并且总是赞扬性情温和、乐于助人的马丁先生，竟然是个单身汉；因为没有个少夫人，马丁也就没成亲。爱玛于是起了疑心，这家人如此热情好客，她这位可怜的小朋友可就危险了，如果没人关照她，她可要一失足成千古恨了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.</div>

He thought we walked towards Randalls most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet. He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him so very plain?'</div>

At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here.'</div>

<div class="line_en">`I wonder he did not remember the book' -- was all Harriet's answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her next beginning was, `In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?'</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet. He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with: -- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.</div>
