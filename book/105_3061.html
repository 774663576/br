<div class="line_cn" title="“就是你啊。”他笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am, he thought, but cast his mind about for an amusing story to distract her with. He knew too well how long the nights could be without sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What did he do in the war?" Dylan asked. Her knowledge of history wasn't great, she'd taken geography instead at school, but everyone was well versed about what happened in the Second World War. She couldn't imagine how guiding a German soldier could be interesting. She might have been tempted to let the demons have him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他在战时是做什么的？”迪伦问。她的历史知识不怎么样，在学校时她选的课是地理，但是每个人都对‘二战’发生的事情如数家珍。她实在想象不出来给个德军士兵做向导能多有趣。如果是她做向导，她很有可能会忍不住让恶魔们来了结他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're judging. When you're a ferryman you cannot stereotype like that. Each soul is individual and has its own merits and faults." Dylan looked sceptical so he continued. "He'd joined because his father had wanted him to, had said he'd dishonour the family if he didn't fight for the glory of the nation. He found himself guarding Jews in a concentration camp, watching as other guards beat them, raped them. He couldn't get out and he didn't dare disobey orders. Then one day his superior ordered him to shoot this old man. He hadn't done anything, just tripped and accidentally touched the superior officer. The soldier didn't want to, and he argued with his superior, told him he wouldn't. So the superior shot the old man, and then had the soldier shot that same day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是在做道德判断。你要是个摆渡人的话，就不能这样带着成见。每一个灵魂都是独特的，都有各自的美德和过错。”看迪伦一脸狐疑，他又继续说，“他参军是被他父亲逼的，他父亲认为他如果不为祖国荣誉而战就是辱没了整个家族。但是，他却被分到了集中营看管犹太人，还眼睁睁地看着其他的卫兵殴打他们、凌辱他们。他无法逃离军营，也不敢违抗军令。一天，他的长官命令他枪杀一个老人。那个老人没有做什么，只是在摔倒时不小心蹭了这位长官一下。这个士兵不愿意杀人，于是跟他的长官争吵了起来，他对长官说自己不能那样做。所以长官先枪杀了老人，然后在同一天把他也枪毙了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The end of his story was met with silence. Dylan was captivated, her head a whirlwind of images, thoughts and emotions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="故事讲完了，一片沉默。迪伦被深深吸引了，她的脑海里闪过很多场景，涌出很多想法，心中五味杂陈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I met him outside the gates of the concentration camp. He was actually relieved to escape, to be out of there. All he could think about were the things he hadn't been able to stop. He was destroyed with guilt. He wished he'd been stronger. He wished he'd stood up to his father and refused to join, he wished he'd protected more innocent people. At times, he wished he'd never been born. I'd never seen a soul in so much despair for such selfless reasons. German soldier or not, he was the most admirable and noble soul I have come across."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在集中营大门外遇到了他的灵魂。离开那里后，他真的感到如释重负、彻底解脱了。他满脑子想的都是自己没办法阻止的那些事情，自责不已，精神完全垮了。他真希望自己当时能再坚强些，能勇敢反抗自己的父亲，拒绝参军。他真希望自己当时能保护更多无辜的人。有时候，他甚至希望自己根本就没有出生。不管他是不是德国士兵，他都是我遇到的最可敬、最高贵的灵魂。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell me another," she begged, and so the night passed that way. Tristan regaled her with tales handpicked from the thousands of souls he'd guided, resolutely sticking to the ones designed to make her laugh, or smile, or pause in wonder, and keeping to himself the ones that still cut into his heart. The light sneaked up on both of them, but the blazing sunshine was glorious and caught Tristan's eye, making him smile wryly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再讲一个吧。”她央求道。漫漫长夜就这样过去了。崔斯坦从自己遇到的成千上万个灵魂中精挑细选了一个又一个故事犒赏迪伦。他特意只拣那些让迪伦发噱解颐或是惊叹不已的故事讲，而对那些至今思之仍痛彻心扉的故事则避而不谈。晨光渐渐落在他们身上，然而炽热的阳光太灿烂了，晃着崔斯坦的眼，竟让他的笑容显得有些苦涩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"More marching," Dylan grumbled when he slithered off the bed and pulled her with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“得继续赶路了。”迪伦嘟囔着。他慢慢滑下床，把她也一起拽下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"More marshes?" Dylan complained, unable to keep the whine out of her voice. She hated the mud that coated everything and dragged her feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还要过沼泽？”迪伦抱怨起来，声音里止不住带了丝哭腔。她讨厌那些见什么沾什么、让她举步维艰的淤泥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We've got one, small, barely-an-incline hill to scale then it's flat all the way. Wet, though." He wrinkled his nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们只要越过一个小山坡，之后就是一马平川了，只不过有点儿潮湿。”他努了一下鼻子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rolled his eyes but bowed obediently and wandered outside. This time Dylan marched behind him and shut the door firmly before whipping off her borrowed clothes and pulling on her old outfit. The wash had at least removed the worst of the mud. They had stiffened in the heat of the fire, but it was nice to have freshly washed clothes to put on. It made her feel almost human again. Or freshly dead at least, she laughed to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他翻了个白眼，但还是恭顺地一鞠躬，走了出去。这次迪伦跟在他身后紧紧关上了门，然后匆匆把借来的衣服脱掉，换上了自己原来穿的一套。昨天这一洗至少除去了最脏的污垢，炉火把布料烘得有些僵硬，但穿上自己新洗的衣服还是非常惬意的。这让她感觉自己还是人，至少也是刚刚死的人。她不禁为自己的想法暗自发笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope we're not swimming," she muttered, wandering over to the fireplace to check her clothes. Although not particularly clean, they were dry and still fairly warm, for the logs were still smoking in the grate. She turned to Tristan. "Out!" she ordered, pointing imperiously at the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我真希望我们别游泳。”她喃喃自语着，走到壁炉那儿查看晾在那儿的衣服。尽管不是特别干净，但它们倒是干了，摸上去还挺暖和，木柴还在壁炉里冒着青烟。她转身对崔斯坦发号施令，“出去！”颐指气使地指着大门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as she was dressed, she walked over to the sink. Turning on the tap, she waited for the brown water to run clear, and then cupped large handfuls, splashing it over her face and neck. She wished she could have washed her hair, but she hadn't thought about it last night, and the soap might have made it even greasier. Taking another scoop of water, she held it in her hands and stared at it thoughtfully. What would happen if she drank it? She glanced at the door but it was still shut. She could ask Tristan but he'd probably laugh at her. She looked back at the water. Although she wasn't thirsty, it was cool and inviting. She remembered the feeling of drinking, of the refreshing taste, the icy sensation of water dropping down her gullet into an empty stomach, making her shiver. Leaning forward, she opened her lips, ready to take a drink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她刚换好衣服就走到水槽边，拧开了水龙头。她等着棕色的水流变清澈，然后双手捧满水，在脸和脖子上擦了一把。她真希望已经洗了头，昨天竟然没有想到这点，不过那个肥皂可能会让头发变得更油。她又捧起了一捧水，仔细端详。如果她现在把水喝下去会怎么样？她看了一眼门口，门还关着。她可以问问崔斯坦，却担心会被他嘲笑。她又看了一眼手中的水，尽管自己并不渴，但这水看起来又清凉又诱人。她回忆起了喝水的感觉，那种让人心旷神怡的口感，那种顺着咽喉滴入肠胃的冰爽快感，想到这里，她不由颤抖着，身子前倾，张开了嘴唇，准备喝上一口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His smile was warm and genuine, and stopped her heart momentarily. Just as quickly, though, it seemed to freeze on his face and he turned away. Confused, Dylan followed silently after him out of the cottage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的笑容温暖而真诚，迪伦的心脏瞬间停止了跳动。不过刹那间他的脸上似乎就结起了一层霜，旋即转身走开了。满心困惑的迪伦默默地跟在他身后走出了小屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh." Dylan dropped the rest of the water out of her hands and turned off the tap. "Well, then, thank you."</div>

<div class="line_en">He shrugged nonchalantly. "It'll make you puke. It's toxic. It comes from a well that goes deep into the ground, and the ground is where the wraiths live. They poison it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他漠然地耸了耸肩，“你喝了会吐的，水里有毒。水是从地下深处一口井里流出来的，那是魔鬼们住的地方，它们在里面下了毒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although the sun stayed strong, a breeze crept up behind her and gently ruffled her hair. She frowned at the sky to chastise it for the cool wind, but was rewarded only by a light fog of fast-moving clouds that quickly covered the sun. She stuck her tongue out at them childishly and concentrated on keeping up with Tristan who was setting a brisk pace. They walked around the cottage and set off across a meadow of grass that reached Dylan's knees. She eyed it warily, hunting for thistles and nettles and other nasty things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管艳阳高照，身后吹来一阵清风，轻柔地吹乱了她的长发。她皱着眉头望天，似乎在责怪这阵冷风，结果只换来了一层快速移动的云翳遮住了太阳。她孩子气地朝着它们吐了一下舌头，然后便一心一意地跟着崔斯坦轻快的步伐。他们绕过小屋，开始穿行在一片几乎没膝的草地上。她谨慎地张望着，四处搜寻着蓟草、荨麻之类的恶心东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们今天很赶时间吗？”她一边问，一边小跑着紧跟上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Barely an incline?" she imitated. "You liar! It's huge!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这也叫小山坡？”她重复着他之前说过的话，“你这个骗子！这山那么大！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," he replied, but then softened, "but we can slow a little. Well, here it is. Your last hill." He gestured in front of him and Dylan, following his pointed finger with her eyes, wrinkled her nose in disgust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对啊！”他回答道。过了一会儿他又柔声说，“不过我们可以慢一点。好了，这就是最后一座山了。”他手指着前面，迪伦顺着他手指的方向望去，反感地皱了一下鼻子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hill looked more like a mountain from Dylan's perspective. There was no gentle ridge to climb, but a sheer-looking face with large rock formations. It reminded her of Joan's one disastrous attempt to get her to enjoy the outdoors with a trip to the Cobbler. She'd told Dylan it would be much more fun to climb the front face, a wall of granite interspersed with slippery gravel patches, than to wander up the ambling path around the rear of the hill. Dylan had got about a third of the way up before she had skidded on the small stones and smacked her shin on a large, pointy rock. She had thrown a major tantrum and insisted that they return home there and then. This looked no more appealing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在迪伦眼中这个所谓的“小山坡”看上去更像是座大山。没有地势平缓的山脊可供攀爬，只有巨大的危岩高耸。这让迪伦想起琼的那一次以悲剧告终的尝试，她想让迪伦爱上到考布勒[1]的登山之旅，于是告诉她从山的正面攀爬要比顺着步道绕着后山走有趣得多。没想到那座山的正面完全就是一堵花岗岩墙，还分布着光滑的砂石小路。迪伦刚爬完三分之一的路程，就踩在一块小石头上打了滑，胫骨撞在了一块有棱角的大岩石上。她猛发了一阵脾气，坚决要马上回家。而眼前的这座山看起来跟考布勒山一样让人不爽。【注：[1]考布勒（Cobbler）山， 位于苏格兰长湖（Loch Long）边，距格拉斯哥一个小时的车程，是当地著名的风景区。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不行啊！”他看着她，笑容依旧灿烂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How about a piggyback?" she suggested, but he was already striding away and her request fell on deaf ears. Despite his injuries, he walked without a hint of a limp as he crossed the meadow, and Dylan had noticed earlier that his face was healing quickly. In fact, the swelling around his eye was almost completely gone leaving only a slight telltale purple blush along his cheekbone. His jaw was no longer multicoloured, but had just the faint shadow of yellow as the bruising faded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你背着人家怎么样嘛？”她又建议道。可他已经大步流星地走远了，对她的请求充耳不闻。尽管他身上有伤，但过草地的时候，却完全没有一瘸一拐的样子。而且，迪伦注意到他脸上的伤也正在快速愈合。事实上，原本在他眼睛周围的红肿现在也几乎已经彻底消退了，只有颧骨旁轻微的紫红色伤痕多少还能透露一点当时的惨状。他的下巴也不再青一块紫一块了，瘀伤渐渐消肿后，上面只残留了一点淡黄色的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan's calves were soon burning as she trudged up the near vertical gradient. Though they were well worn-in and comfortable, her shoes rubbed a blister onto the ball of her foot in protest at the odd angle her feet were forced to keep to retain her balance. About halfway up, the angle became even more acute and she was compelled to climb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦顺着几乎垂直的花岗岩壁艰难攀爬，小腿肚子很快便开始火辣辣地疼。尽管她的鞋已经饱经磨砺，穿上去也很舒适，但为了保持平衡，她的双脚时不时要七扭八歪地着地，结果前脚掌还是磨出了一个水泡。行程过半时，山势越来越陡峭，她只能手脚并用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan trotted after him and they reached the base of the hill ten minutes later. The incline was so uninviting even the grass hadn't penetrated it; it gave up just a few metres above the initial slopes. From then on up, it was dirt, gravel and rock. The occasional hardy plant wound its way out from under boulders, but otherwise it was inhospitable and desolate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦一路小跑着跟在他后面，十分钟后两人来到了山脚下。这个“山坡”也太不讨喜了，连荒草都不愿覆盖它，它们只长到山脚下的斜坡上面几米就不再延伸了。再往上就只有尘土、沙砾和岩石。虽然一些巨石下面蜿蜒生长出了零星的几株耐寒植物，但除此以外，整座山便是没有半点生气的不毛之地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦坚持要她走在前面，他声称这样是考虑到万一她跌倒了，自己还能接住她。不过，迪伦暗自怀疑他只是为了欣赏她拼命攀爬时的窘态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Almost there," he called from a metre below her. "Trust me, when you reach the top, the view'll be worth it."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My arse," she muttered under her breath. Her arms and legs were both aching and her fingers were raw and ingrained with dirt. She hauled herself up another few metres onto a small ledge and paused to catch her breath. Foolishly, she looked down and gasped at the sight below her. The ground fell away steeply and the high grass was a long, long way down. She swayed dizzily with vertigo and groaned as her stomach twisted with nausea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我才不信。”她小声嘀咕了一句。她的胳膊和腿都又酸又痛，手指全都擦破了皮，满是泥垢。她又费劲地爬了几米，在一块从峭壁突出来的壁架上停下来喘口气。她傻乎乎地朝下一望，顿时被眼前的一切惊得倒抽一口冷气。脚下的路面异常陡峭，刚才那一片草地已经在下面很远很远的地方了。她感到一阵眩晕，身子晃了几晃，胃里一阵痉挛恶心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't look down," Tristan called sharply from underneath, watching her turn slightly green. He was directly in her line of fire should the vertigo cause her to be sick. But that wasn't all. If she fell here, if she plummeted down the ruthlessly steep incline… that would it be it. She'd die. And this time she'd be gone. Like a snail without its shell, her soul was as vulnerable in the wasteland as her body had been in the real world. "Come on, keep going," he called encouragingly. "I promise you're almost there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别往下看。”崔斯坦看着她脸色有些发青，从下面厉声喝道。她要是晕倒了，首当其冲的就是他。不仅如此，如果她从这儿掉下去，如果她就这样顺着峭壁垂直落下去……她就完了，这一次就是彻底地魂飞魄散了。如同失去了外壳保护的蜗牛，她在荒原上的魂魄就如同她在现实世界中的身体一样非常脆弱，“加油，继续，”他鼓励着她，“就快到了，我保证。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan dragged herself up onto her elbows and peered off into the distance. She had to admit it was a stunning view. The landscape was shimmering, like a million diamonds sparkling in the sun. She squinted, trying to make sense of what she was seeing. It looked as though the glistening surface was undulating. Her scrambled brain tried to enforce logic onto what her eyes saw. Ah, water. It was a lake, a giant lake that stretched south of the hill as far as the eye could see. The pooling water was wide, extending miles to the east and west. There was no way they could circle it, it would take forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦用胳膊肘支着身子，向远方凝视。她不得不承认这里的景色的确壮观。眼前一片璀璨的光芒，如同上百万颗钻石在太阳下熠熠生辉。迪伦眯起眼睛，想弄清楚眼前看到的是什么。似乎有个闪光的物体在起起伏伏，她绞尽脑汁，试图给眼前看到的景物一个合理的解释。啊，是水，是一个湖。极目远眺，一个大湖从山南流过。水面宽阔，东西绵延数英里。他们绝对绕不过去，那要花上很久很久的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan looked unconvinced, but turned back to the rock face and continued to heave herself up. A short time later she found herself at the top. She flopped over and lay panting on a small patch of resilient heather that was miraculously surviving the hostile environment. Tristan followed moments later and stood over her, not even breathing hard. Dylan eyed him with disgust. He ignored her look and nodded towards the horizon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦面露狐疑之色，但还是转过脸对着岩壁，继续往上爬。片刻后，她发觉自己真的身处山顶了。她颓然倒在一小丛在严酷环境中侥幸存活的石楠花上，大口喘着气。过了一会儿，崔斯坦也上来了，站在她的身边，大气也不喘一下。迪伦厌恶地看着他，而他却毫不理会，只是对着地平线颔首。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How are we supposed to cross that?" she spluttered, recovering the use of her voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们又该怎么穿过那个湖呢？”她终于开口讲话了，声音有些气急败坏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't worry, we're not swimming." A knowing smile played its way across his lips. Dylan frowned. He always had to be so secretive. "Come on, time to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别担心，我们不用游过去。”他嘴唇上露出狡黠的微笑。迪伦皱起了眉头，他老是这么神神秘秘的，“来吧，该走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Urgh," Dylan groaned, pulling herself up to a sitting position against the will of her tired muscles. She scrambled to her feet and glared at the descent. It looked more inviting than the climb up, but not by much. On this more sheltered side, grass and small bushes grew in clumps all the way down the hill, intersected by rivers of gravel. The short rest had obviously not been part of Tristan's plans as he seemed in a hurry to get down to the lakeside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃。”迪伦嘀咕着，不顾全身疲惫不堪的肌肉，硬撑着坐了起来。她挣扎着站起来，直直瞪着下山的路。看起来比上山的路好走了些，但也没有好多少。这一面山麓上植被茂密得多，一路上全是一丛丛的荒草和灌木，一大片一大片的碎石点缀其间。很明显，崔斯坦根本不打算在这里作片刻休息，他似乎急着要赶到湖边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan slipped and slid her way down behind him as he walked confidently and securely, not even glancing at the ground beneath his feet. A sudden two-metre skid made her yelp and throw her arms out to the side. Tristan didn't even look round, but shook his head at her clumsiness. Dylan stuck her tongue out at him. She was sure he could have carried her if he really wanted to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦一路跌跌撞撞地跟在后面，而他的步伐却总是那么信心满满，稳稳当当。突然她脚下一滑，往下溜出去两米。她不由大叫了一声，手臂忙向身子两侧一挡。可崔斯坦连头也没回，只是为她的笨手笨脚摇了摇头。迪伦对着他吐了吐舌头。她确信如果崔斯坦愿意的话，本来可以背着她走的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan turned left just at the boundary of the stones and headed towards a small building off in the distance. Dylan didn't even bother to ask, but followed dutifully after him. As they drew closer, she realised it was a windowless shed with an apex roof covered in tarpaulin that looked ripped in several places. Tristan reached the wooden building several steps before her, and she saw him round one corner and appraise two huge doors that took up most of the wall. They didn't seem to be padlocked, but Dylan couldn't see any kind of handle or knob to open it. Unsurprisingly, within a second of reaching the doors, Tristan had both open wide, revealing what was hidden within.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦在石头水岸的边界处向左转，然后朝着远方一处小房子走去，迪伦连问也没问就老老实实地跟在后面。等到他们渐渐走近的时候，她才看清这是一间没有窗子的简易窝棚，屋顶上盖着防水油布，看上去已经有几处破损。崔斯坦比她快几步先到小木屋，只见他站在房子的一角，仔细端详着占据了大部分墙体的两扇大门。门似乎没有上锁，但是迪伦没有看到门把手之类开门的东西。就在到达门前的一瞬间，崔斯坦毫无意外地打开了那两扇门，露出了藏在屋里的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the base of the hill, the water spread out before them. It was majestic, with small waves created by the breeze rippling gently across its surface. Its undulating form spread as far as the horizon, and seemed to Dylan almost to be breathing. Like a living thing, it moved and whispered, the water lapping quietly against a narrow beach of shiny black pebbles. Beyond the hushed sound of the waves tickling the shore, the water was silent. It was eerily noiseless. There was no wind rushing in her ears, and without it Dylan was abruptly aware of the absence of wildlife. There were no gulls diving across the surface of the water, screeching as they searched for food, or ducks paddling in the shallows. It seemed empty and, although magnificent, the lake frightened Dylan a little.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山脚下，湖水就在他们面前流过。风在水面上卷起波澜，看上去十分壮观。起伏的波浪一直延伸到了远处的地平线，在迪伦看来，这湖水就像是在呼吸一样。仿佛它也有了灵性，挪移着步子，低声细语，轻轻拍打着布满黑亮的鹅卵石的狭长湖滨。除了浪花拂过岸边时发出的声音外，湖水一片沉寂，静得离奇。迪伦的耳边没有狂风呼啸，她突然意识到这里竟然没有任何野生动物。既没有在觅食时发出尖厉叫声的水鸟掠过水面，也没有水鸭在浅滩戏水。水面上似乎空空荡荡，尽管景色壮观，但迪伦还是有些害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a small dinghy, if you could call it that, made of roughly hewn wood. It had once been painted in white with red and blue trim, but that had long since faded; only a few resilient flakes hung on to commemorate the jaunty glory of its youth. It stood on a small wheeled trolley which had a coil of frayed rope attached to the front. Tristan grabbed hold of the rope with both hands and heaved. The boat scraped forward a little with a loud groan from the trailer's rusty wheels. He turned and lifted the rope over his shoulder, pulling forward. Slowly the boat rolled out of the shed. In the light of day it looked even less water-worthy than in the gloom of the boatshed. The wood was rotten in places, and some of the planks were split down their entire length.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个类似小艇的东西，由经过粗加工的木头做成。船体本来还刷了一层白、红、蓝三色的油漆，不过早已褪色，现在只剩下些斑驳的颜色，无声地纪念着它盛年时曾经的活力与荣耀。小艇下面是一辆带轮子的手推车，车前系着一卷有些磨损的绳子。崔斯坦双手抓住绳子往上抬，伴着生锈的拖车轮子嘎吱的响声，小艇往前挪动了一点。他转身把绳子挽在肩头，奋力向前拉，小艇一点点地被滚动的车轮带出了小屋。跟刚才在昏暗的棚子里看到的情景相比，日光下的小艇看上去更加不适合下水。船体的木头有多处都已经朽烂，有几块木板更是已经和船身彻底分离了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan looked extremely dubious. "It's still attached to the trolley."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦非常疑惑地看着他，“可船还系在拖车上呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rolled his eyes. "We won't exactly be coming back this way. I'm just going to push it till the boat floats and comes away from it. You can wait till we're waist deep in water to get in, if you want to."</div>

<div class="line_en">Putting one foot on the trolley wheel, she grabbed hold of the back of the tiny boat and heaved her other leg over the side. Her momentum carried her forward and she almost smacked face first into the little wooden bench, her hand saving her just in time and sending jarring tremors up into her shoulder. She righted herself with as much dignity as she could muster and tried to find a comfortable way to perch on the one seat. She had no idea where Tristan was planning to sit. Or how he would steer. Or, yet more importantly, how he planned to make this little boat actually move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一只脚踩在拖车的轮子上，手抓着小艇的后面，另一条腿踏进舱里。这一使劲带得她身体前倾，脸几乎撞上了小艇的木质板凳，幸亏她及时用手挡住，肩膀还是猛然震了一下。迪伦鼓起自己所有的自尊心稳住心神，然后尽量找了种舒适的方式坐到座位上。她不知道崔斯坦打算坐在哪里，也不清楚他会怎么操控这艘小艇。还有更为重要的问题是，他打算怎样挪动它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan frowned and pursed her lips, but approached the edge of the water. Now that she was up close to it, she noticed something odd about the lake. The water was black, not the kind of black that you would associate with water at night or under a heavy kind of cloud, but as if the water was made of tar -- only much more fluid. She wanted to run her hand through it and see what it felt like, but she didn't dare. Still, Tristan was planning to wade out into it, so it couldn't be anything too poisonous. That thought comforted her as she prepared to set herself afloat on the strange lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦皱着眉头噘了一下嘴，但还是朝水边走去。近观湖水，她察觉出了一些异样。水是黑色的，不是夜色下或阴云密布时的那种黝黑色湖水，整个湖好像是装满了沥青一样—只不过没有沥青那么黏稠而已。她想把手放入水中，试试看这水摸上去到底是什么感觉，可她终究还是没这个胆量。不过既然崔斯坦打算涉水上船，这水的毒性也不会很强。这样一想，她心里顿时宽慰了不少，于是也准备走进这片陌生的水域。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as Tristan saw that she was safely balanced and upright, he began to push the boat further into the water. It was heavier with her sitting in it, and his muscles strained with the effort. The black water was freezing cold and unseen things tangled at his ankles, dragging each foot forward so that it became a momentous effort. At last he felt the boat lift away from the trolley and bob on the surface. Using the frame of the trolley to lift himself slightly out of the water, he jumped lightly into the boat. The movement made the vessel rock violently, and his swinging legs sprayed Dylan with icy droplets. She screeched and grabbed hold of both sides of the little dinghy, screwing up her eyes and turning her face away from the showery assault.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦看到她身子挺得笔直安坐在小艇上，于是马上开始把它往水里拖。有她坐在上面，小艇变得更沉了，他全身的肌肉都绷紧了。黑水冰冷刺骨，还有一些看不见的东西围着他的脚踝绕来绕去，往前拽着他的双脚，所以他每走一步都非常艰难。终于，当他感到船离开拖车，浮在了水面上时，他撑着车身把自己的身体稍稍抬出水面，然后轻轻跳到了舱里。小艇随之剧烈摇晃起来，他双腿带起的冰冷水珠溅在迪伦身上。她尖叫了一声，紧紧抓住小艇的两边，眯起眼睛，把脸转到一边躲避“阵雨”的突袭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stared at each other for a moment; one face annoyed, the other amused. The craft swayed gently on the lightly lapping waves and the wind was calm. It would have been extremely pleasant with the sun directly overhead radiating warmth, were it not for the ominous, dark water beneath them.</div>
