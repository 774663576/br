<div class="line_en">She studied the sharp contours of her own pale face framed by that impossible hair which defied any style but nature's own.

The apparition lasted only a few seconds. Then she was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她仔细审视着自己那张轮廓分明苍白的脸，以及脸四周那一头做不出任何发型的难缠的头发。但在那张脸之外却浮现了另外一个女孩的幽灵。突然间，那个女孩疯狂地眨着双眼，仿佛是在向苏菲做信号，说她的确在那儿。这个幽灵出现的时间只有几秒钟，然后便消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before getting into bed she stood in front of the big brass mirror which now hung on her wall. At first she only saw her own white and exhausted face.

<div class="line_en">Sophie sat down on the edge of the bed. She had absolutely no doubt that it was Hilde she had seen in the mirror. She had caught a glimpse of her picture on a school I. D. in the major's cabin. It must have been the same girl she had seen in the mirror.</div>

<div class="line_en">She dreamed she was standing in a large garden that sloped down to a red boathouse. On the dock behind it sat a young fair-haired girl gazing out over the water. Sophie walked down and sat beside her. But the girl seemed not to notice her. Sophie introduced herself. "I'm Sophie," she said. But the other girl could apparently neither see nor hear her. Suddenly Sophie heard a voice calling, "Hilde!" At once the girl jumped up from where she was sitting and ran as fast as she could up to the house. She couldn't have been deaf or blind after all. A middle-aged man came striding from the house toward her. He was wearing a khaki uniform and a blue beret. The girl threw her arms around his neck and he swung her around a few times. Sophie noticed a little gold crucifix on a chain lying on the dock where the girl had been sitting. She picked it up and held it in her hand. Then she woke up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她梦见自己站在一座大花园中。园里有一道山坡向下通往一座船库。船库后面的平台上坐着一个年轻的金发女孩，正在眺望着大海。苏菲走下去，坐在她身旁，但那女孩却似乎没有察觉她的到来。苏菲开始自我介绍：“我叫苏菲，”她说。但这个女孩显然既没看到她的人，也没听到她说话。“你显然又聋又瞎。”苏菲说。那女孩还是充耳不闻。突然间苏菲听到一个声音在喊：“席德！”那女孩立刻跳起来，向船库的方向飞奔。看来她既不聋也不瞎。此时一名中年男子从船库大步向她走来。他身穿卡其布制服，头戴蓝扁帽。女孩展开双臂抱住他的脖子，他则将她抱起，转了几圈。这时，苏菲在女孩原先所坐之处看到一条小小的金色十字架链子。她将它捡起来，拿在手中，然后便醒了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie laid her clothes on the chair and crawled into bed. She fell asleep at once and had a strangely vivid dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie looked at the clock. She had been asleep for two hours. She sat up in bed, thinking about the strange dream. It was so real that she felt as if she had actually lived the experience. She was equally sure that the house and the dock really existed somewhere. Surely it resembled the picture she had seen hanging in the major's cabin? Anyway, there was no doubt at all that the girl in her dream was Hilde Moller Knag and that the man was her father, home from Lebanon. In her dream he had looked a lot like Alberto Knox…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲看看时钟，她已经睡子两个小时。她坐起来，想着这个奇怪的梦。梦境里的一切是如此栩栩如生，她觉得自己好像确实到过那里一样，她也很确定那座船库和平台确实存在于某个地方。当然，它们看起来很像是她在少校的小木屋中见过的那幅风景画。无论如何，她梦中的那个女孩无疑必是席德，而那个男人则是她的爸爸，刚从黎巴嫩回来。在梦中，他的样子看起来很像艾伯特。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dear Hilde, Now Sophie is coming to the philosopher's house. She will soon be fifteen, but you were fifteen yesterday. Or is it today, Hilde? If it is today, it must be late, then. But our watches do not always agree. One generation ages while another generation is brought forth. In the meantime history takes its course. Have you ever thought that the history of Europe is like a human life? Antiquity is like the childhood of Europe. Then come the interminable Middle Ages -- Europe's schoolday. But at last comes the Renaissance; the long school-day is over. Europe comes of age in a burst of exuberance and a thirst for life. We could say that the Renaissance is Europe's fifteenth birthday! It is mid-June, my child, and it is wonderful to be alive!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲爱的席德：现在苏菲已经到哲学家的家里来了。她很快就要满十五岁了，但你昨天就满十五了。还是今天呢？如果是今天的话，那么信到的大迟了。不过我们两个的时间并不一定一致。下一代出来后，上一代就老了。历史就这样发展下去。你有没有想过欧洲的历史就像一个人的一生？古代就像欧洲的童年，然后到了漫长的中世纪，这是欧洲的学生时期。最后终于到了文艺复兴时期，此时，漫长的求学时期结束了。欧洲成年了，充满了旺盛的活力以及对生命的渴望。我们可以说文艺复兴时期是欧洲的十五岁生日！现在是六月中旬了，我的孩子，活着的感觉真好，不是吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermes was already on his way up the stairs. Sophie took the postcard with her and followed. She had to run to keep up with him; he was wagging his tail delightedly.

Hermes clambered on up the stairs and stopped outside a narrow door, which he scratched at with his paw.</div>

There was a sofa from the thirties, an old desk from the beginning of the century, and a chair that had to be hundreds of years old. But it wasn't just the furniture. Old objects, either useful or decorative, were jumbled together on shelves and cupboards. There were old clocks and vases, mortars and retorts, knives and dolls, quill pens and bookends, octants and sextants, compasses and barometers. One entire wall was covered with books, but not the sort of books found in most bookstores. The book collection itself was a cross section of the production of many hundreds of years. On the other walls hung drawings and paintings, some from recent decades, but most of them also very old. There were a lot of old charts and maps on the walls too, and as far as Norway was concerned, they were not very accurate.</div>

That old sixteenth-century wooden doll might have been made for a five-year-old girl's birthday. By her old grandfather, maybe… then she became a teenager, then an adult, and then she married. Maybe she had a daughter of her own and gave the doll to her. She grew old, and one day she died. Although she had lived for a very long time, one day she was dead and gone.

Philosophy and science broke away more and more from the theology of the Church, thus enabling religious life to attain a freer relationship to reasoning.

The important thing for a man was not to understand the divine mystery but to submit to God's will.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在圣多玛斯的时代过后不久，原本团结一致的天主教文化开始出现分裂的现象。哲学与科学逐渐脱离教会的神学，使得宗教生活与理性思考之间的关系变得比较自由。当时有愈来愈多人强调人们不能透过理性与天主沟通，因为天主绝对是不可知的。对人来说，最重要的事不是去了解神的奥秘，而是服从神的旨意。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The new weapons gave the Europeans military superiority over American and Asiatic cultures, although firearms were also an important factor in Europe. Printing played an important part in spreading the Renaissance humanists' new ideas.

<div class="line_en">"That is precisely why we speak of a 'rebirth' of antiquity's humanism. But Renaissance humanism was to an even greater extent characterized by individualism. We are not only human beings, we are unique individuals. This idea could then lead to an almost unrestrained worship of genius. The ideal became what we call the Renaissance man, a man of universal genius embracing all aspects of life, art, and science. The new view of man also manifested itself in an interest in the human anatomy. As in ancient times, people once again began to dissect the dead to discover how the body was constructed. It was imperative both for medical science and for art. Once again it became usual for works of art to depict the nude. High time, after a thousand years of prudery. Man was bold enough to be himself again. There was no longer anything to be ashamed of."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Above all else, the Renaissance resulted in a new view of mankind. The humanism of the Renaissance brought a new belief in man and his worth, in striking contrast to the biased medieval emphasis on the sinful nature of man. Man was now considered infinitely great and valuable. One of the central figures of the Renaissance was Marsilio Ficino, who exclaimed: 'Know thyself, O divine lineage in mortal guise!'

They became intensely conscious of their epoch, which is what led them to introduce the term 'Middle Ages' to cover the centuries between antiquity and their own time. There was an unrivaled development in all spheres of life. Art and architecture, literature, music, philosophy, and science flourished as never before. I will mention one concrete example. We have spoken of Ancient Rome, which gloried in titles such as the 'city of cities' and the 'hub of the universe.' During the Middle Ages the city declined, and by 1417 the old metropolis had only 17,000 inhabitants."</div>

It was also significant that the Renaissance brought with it a new view of nature. The fact that man felt at home in the world and did not consider life solely as a preparation for the hereafter, created a whole new approach to the physical world. Nature was now regarded as a positive thing. Many held the view that God was also present in his creation. If he is indeed infinite, he must be present in everything. This idea is called pantheism. The medieval philosophers had insisted that there is an insurmountable barrier between God and the Creation. It could now be said that nature is divine -- and even that it is 'God's blossoming.' Ideas of this kind were not always looked kindly on by the church. The fate of Gior-dano Bruno was a dramatic example of this. Not only did he claim that God was present in nature, he also believed that the universe was infinite in scope. He was punished very severely for his ideas."</div>

Galileo Galilei, who was roughly contemporary with Kepler, also used a telescope to observe the heavenly bodies. He studied the moon's craters and said that the moon had mountains and valleys similar to those on earth. Moreover, he discovered that the planet Jupiter had four moons. So the earth was not alone in having a moon. But the greatest significance of Galileo was that he first formulated the so-called Law of Inertia."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. He had nothing on which to base his belief in the circular orbits other than the ancient idea that heavenly bodies were round and moved in circles simply because they were 'heavenly.' Since the time of Plato the sphere and the circle had been considered the most perfect geometrical figures. But in the early 1600s, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler presented the results of comprehensive observations which showed that the planets move in elliptical -- or oval -- orbits with the sun at one focus. He also pointed out that the speed of a planet is greatest when it is closest to the sun, and that the farther a planet's orbit is from the sun the slower it moves. Not until Kepler's time was it actually stated that the earth was a planet just like other planets. Kepler also emphasized that the same physical laws apply everywhere throughout the universe."</div>

So it will have described a trajectory corresponding to the marble's path across the inclined plane. And this was actually a new discovery at the time of Galileo.

This was not so, but nobody could know Aristotle was wrong before it had been demonstrated."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，马丁路德是一个很重要的人物，但他并不是当时唯一的宗教改革家。另有一些改革人士选择留在罗马天主教会中。其中之一是荷兰的伊拉斯莫斯（Erasmus of Rotterdam）。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“马丁路德之所以和天主教会决裂是因为他不肯购买赎罪券，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, that was one of the reasons. But there was a more important reason. According to Luther, people did not need the intercession of the church or its priests in order to receive God's forgiveness. Neither was God's forgiveness dependent on the buying of 'indulgences' from the church. Trading in these so-called letters of indulgence was forbidden by the Catholic Church from the middle of the sixteenth century."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，但这只是其中原因之一。另外还有一个更重要的原因是：马丁路德认为人们并不需要教会或教士居中代祷才能获得上帝的赦免。同时，要取得上帝的赦免也不是靠购买教会所售的‘赎罪券’。从十六世纪中期起，天主教教会就禁止买这些所谓的‘赎罪券’。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In general, Luther distanced himself from many of the religious customs and dogmas that had become rooted in ecclesiastical history during the Middle Ages. He wanted to return to early Christianity as it was in the New Testament. The Scripture alone,' he said. With this slogan Luther wished to return to the 'source' of Christianity, just as the Renaissance humanists had wanted to turn to the ancient sources of art and culture. Luther translated the Bible into German, thereby founding the German written language. He believed every man should be able to read the Bible and thus in a sense become his own priest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“总而言之，马丁路德摒斥了教会中许多从中世纪起就形成的宗教习惯与教条。他希望回到新约中所描述的早期基督教的面貌。他说：‘我们只信靠经文。’他希望以这个口号将基督教带回它的‘源头’，就像文艺复兴时期的人文主义者希望回到艺术与文化的古老源头一般。马丁路德将圣经译成德文，因此创造了德文的文字。他认为应该让每一个人都读得懂圣经，并从某一个意义上来说，成为自己的教士。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes and no. A characteristic Renaissance feature was his emphasis on the individual and the individual's personal relationship to God. So he taught himself Greek at the age of thirty-five and began the laborious job of translating the Bible from the ancient Greek version into German. Allowing the language of the people to take precedence over Latin was also a characteristic Renaissance feature. But Luther was not a humanist like Ficino or Leonardo da Vinci. He was also opposed by humanists such as Erasmus of Rotterdam because they thought his view of man was far too negative; Luther had proclaimed that mankind was totally depraved after the Fall from Grace. Only through the grace of God could mankind be 'justified,' he believed. For the wages of sin is death."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也不尽然。马丁路德重视个人，强调个人与上帝之间的关系。在这一点上他算是典型的文艺复兴人士。也因此他从三十五岁开始自修希腊文，并进行将圣经翻译成德文的繁重工作。他使得一般大众使用的语言取代了拉丁文的地位，这也是他与典型文艺复兴人士相像的另外一个特征。然而，马丁路德并不像费其诺或达文西一样是人文主义者。同时，他也受到伊拉斯莫斯等人文主义者的批评，因为他们认为他对人的观点太过消极了。马丁路德曾经宣称，自从亚当与夏娃被逐出伊甸园后，人类就彻底腐化了，他相信唯有透过上帝的恩典，人类才能免于罪孽。因为罪恶的代价就是死亡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The Lutheran congregations employed priests for practical reasons, such as conducting services and attending to the daily clerical tasks, but Luther did not believe that anyone received God's for-giveness and redemption from sin through church rituals. Man received 'free' redemption through faith alone, he said. This was a belief he arrived at by reading the Bible."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的意思是：教士与上帝的关系并不比一般人亲近。路德派教会之所以雇用教士，乃是因为他们需要有人做一些实际的工作，如主持礼拜或料理日常事务等。但马丁路德并不相信任何人能够透过教会举行的仪式，获得上帝的赦免与宽宥。他说，人只能透过信仰得救，这是‘无法用金钱交换的’。这些都是他在研读圣经以后的心得。”">查看中文翻译</div>
