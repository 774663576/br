<div class="line_en">The journey was fast and enjoyable. We were met at Newtown Station and driven to Baskerville Hall. The countryside we drove through was beautiful, but behind it we could see the long, dark, frightening hills of the moor.</div>

<div class="line_en">I remembered the case well. It had been a very cruel murder. I thought of this killer out on the empty, wild moor, and I felt more and more uncomfortable about my surroundings. The beautiful green fields with their thick hedges were behind us, and we were now on the cold, open moor. Everything was grey, hard and wild Huge rough stones stood on the hard ground. The tops of the hills stood sharply like cruel teeth against the sky. A cold wind was blowing, and night was falling. I saw Sir Henry pull his coat closer round him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Holmes came to Waterloo Station to say goodbye to us. Our friends told him that they were sure nobody had followed them since our last meeting. Sir Henry's other shoe had not reappeared. Holmes repeated his warning that Sir Henry should not go on the moor at night, and should not go any where alone. Then Holmes checked with me that I had my gun, an army revolver.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last we reached the gates of Baskerville Hall. From the gates a long, dark road led up to the house, with the black shapes of old trees on each side of it. At the end of this road we could see the great house standing with a pale light round it like a ghost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们终于到了巴斯克维尔庄园的门口。大门那儿有一条漫长而又阴暗的路径通向房屋，道路的两旁是一些老树的暗影。我们在道路的尽头处看到一所像幽灵似地闪着微光的房屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we got closer, we could see that the Hall was a heavy, dark building with a large main entrance. Most of the building was old and was covered in dark green ivy, but some of it had been built more recently and was of grim, black stone. A dull light shone through the heavy windows. Black smoke was coming from one of the high chimneys of the main building.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走近时，看到这是一栋结实而又幽暗、主入口处很大的建筑。建筑物的大部分都很古老了，墙壁上爬满了深绿色的常春藤；可是某些部分却是最近刚砌成的，材料是一些阴森的黑色石块。阴暗的光线从结实的窗口透出来。黑烟从主楼的一个高高的烟囱里喷了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barrymore, the butler, and his wife were waiting on the steps at the main entrance They came down and took our suitcases into the house Dr Mortimer left us to go home, and we went into the hall, where a fire was burning. It was a fine room, large and high.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner we went to our rooms. Before I got into bed, I looked out of my window A strong wind sang sadly as it bent the trees in front of the Hall. A half moon shone through the dark, flying clouds onto the wild and empty moor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭过后我们便各自回房去了。我在上床之前向窗外眺望了一番。强风在外面悲鸣，同时还使庄园前面的树木摇晃着。半轮月亮透过阴暗的、飞奔的云朵照到了荒凉、空旷的沼地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barrymore showed us to our rooms He was a tall, handsome man, with a full black beard. After we had washed and changed our clothes, he brought us to dinner. The dining-room was not very welcoming. It needed more lights to make it brighter. On the walls were the pictures of the Baskervilles of the past. They looked down on us silently, and did nothing to make us feel happier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白瑞摩把我们带到了各自的房间。他是个高大、英俊的男子，留着满腮的黑胡子。在我们洗漱之后，他带我们去进餐。饭厅不太招人喜欢。需要再点些蜡烛把它照亮些。墙上是巴斯克维尔家族的先辈们的画像。它们消无声息地俯视着我们，丝毫没让我们感觉快活一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could not sleep. Then, suddenly, in the middle of the night I heard very clearly the sound of a woman crying. It was the crying of a person who was hurt by some deep sadness. The sound was not far away, and was certainly in the house.</div>
