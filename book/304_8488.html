It seems that the Italian could not have done it -- a pity. I suppose the English valet is not lying when he said the other never left the compartment? But why should he? It is not easy to bribe the English, they are so unapproachable. The whole thing is most unfortunate. I wonder when we shall get out of this. There must be some rescue work in progress. They are so slow in these countries… it is hours before anyone thinks of doing anything.

<div class="line_cn" title="“这些问题对你们有没有启发？”波洛问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would like first to mention certain points which appear to me suggestive. Let us start with a remark made to me by M. Bouc in this very place on the occasion of our first lunch together on the train. He commented on the fact that we were surrounded by people of all classes, of all ages, of all nationalities. That is a fact somewhat rare at this time of year. The Athens-Paris and the Bucharest-Paris coaches, for instance, are almost empty. Remember also one passenger who failed to turn up. It is, I think, significant. Then there are some minor points that strike me as suggestive -- for instance, the position of Mrs. Hubbard's sponge bag, the name of Mrs. Armstrong's mother, the detective methods of M. Hardman, the suggestion of M. MacQueen that Ratchett himself destroyed the charred note we found, Princess Dragomiroff's Christian name, and a grease spot on a Hungarian passport."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“首先我说几点看起来对我有启发性的问题。让我先从和布克先生在这个地方一起吃午饭时，他给我讲的一句话开始说起吧。他说我们周围都是一些不同阶层、不同国籍、不同年龄段的人。这在一年中的这个时候确实是很少见的。比如，雅典－巴黎，布加勒斯特－巴黎这两节车厢几乎是空的。别忘了，还有一个旅客没出现。我认为这个人值得注意。另外，还有几个小问题对我很有启发——比如，哈巴特太太洗漱包的位置，阿姆斯特朗太太母亲的名字，哈德曼先生的侦探手法，麦奎因所说的是雷切特自己烧毁了我们发现的焦了的纸片，德拉戈米罗夫公主的教名，以及匈牙利人护照上的油迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am going to approach it from another angle. Let us go back to the handkerchief found at the scene of the crime. As we have stated not long ago -- three people are associated with the letter H. Mrs. Hubbard, Miss Debenham and the maid, Hildegarde Schmidt. Now let us regard that handkerchief from another point of view. It is, my friends, an extremely expensive handkerchief -- an objet de luxe, hand made, embroidered in Paris. Which of the passengers, apart from the initial, was likely to own such a handkerchief? Not Mrs. Hubbard, a worthy woman with no pretensions to reckless extravagance in dress. Not Miss Debenham; that class of English-woman has a dainty linen handkerchief, but not an expensive wisp of cambric costing perhaps two hundred francs. And certainly not the maid. But there are two women on the train who would be likely to own such a handkerchief. Let us see if we can connect them in any way with the letter H. The two women I refer to are Princess Dragomiroff --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从另外一个角度来解释这个问题。让我们回到在案发现场发现的那块手帕上面。就像前不久我们说过的那样，三个人跟这个字母有关系：哈巴特太太、德贝纳姆小姐和女仆希尔德嘉德·施密特。现在我们从另外一个观点看这块手帕。我的朋友们，这是一块非常昂贵的手帕——一件奢侈品、手工制作、巴黎刺绣。这些旅客中，先不说姓名首字母，哪一个人有可能拥有这么一块手帕？不是哈巴特太大，她是个举止得体的女人，不喜欢在衣着上表现得很奢侈。不是德贝纳姆小姐，那个阶层的英国女人都用雅致的麻布手帕，而非昂贵的、可能要花掉两百法郎的棉纱手帕。而且肯定不是女仆。但是火车上有两个女人有可能用这种手帕。总之，让我们看看是否能把她们的名字跟字母H联系起来，我说的是德拉戈米罗夫公主——”">查看中文翻译</div>

It is one that happens to run over the first initial on top of the case. That label has been soaked off and put on again in a different place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然是个好主意！我到处寻找我这个想法的证明，不管多么微小——并且找到了。她行李箱上的一个标签有些潮湿，正好在箱子上面的首字母上。标签是用水浸湿之后，揭下来又贴在另外一个地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

What, then, would have happened?</div>

<div class="line_en">"The murder, let us say, would still have been discovered in all probability at the Italian frontier early this morning. Much of the same evidence would have been given to the Italian police. The threatening letters would have been produced by M. MacQueen, M. Hardman would have told his story, Mrs. Hubbard would have been eager to tell how a man passed through her compartment, the button would have been found. I imagine that two things only would have been different. The man would have passed through Mrs. Hubbard's compartment just before one o'clock -- and the Wagon Lit uniform would have been found cast off in one of the toilets."</div>

He was waiting for the train to go on. But at last he realized that the train was not going on. Different plans would have to be made. The murderer would now be known to be still on the train."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是大雪改变了一切。毫无疑问，我们已经知道凶手为什么在房间里跟受害人待这么久了，他在等火车继续往前开。但是他最终意识到火车开不了了，必须另行制订计划。现在已经知道凶手仍然还在火车上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I mean that the murder was planned to look like an outside job. The assassin would have been presumed to have left the train at Brod, where the train is timed to arrive at 00:58. Somebody would probably have passed a strange Wagon Lit conductor in the corridor. The uniform would be left in a conspicuous place so as to show clearly just how the trick had been played. No suspicion would have been attached to the passengers. That, my friends, was how the affair was intended to appear to the outside world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的意思是，凶杀案原本计划得像是外面的人干的。凶手原本打算等火车零点五十八分准时到达布罗德时下车，有人可能会在过道上碰见一个奇怪的列车员，制服则被扔在一个显眼的地方，这样人们就能看清凶手设计的骗局。这样所有的旅客都不会有嫌疑。我的朋友，凶案原本是想以这样的形式展现出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am returning to it by a somewhat circuitous route. To begin with, you must realize that the threatening letters were in the nature of a blind. They might have been lifted bodily out of an indifferently written American crime novel. They are not real. They are, in fact, simply intended for the police. What we have to ask ourselves is, 'Did they deceive Ratchett?' On the face of it, the answer seems to be, 'No.' His instructions to Hardman seem to point to a definite 'private' enemy of the identity of whom he was well aware. That is if we accept Hardman's story as true. But Ratchett certainly received one letter of a very different character -- the one containing a reference to the Armstrong baby, a fragment of which we found in his compartment. In case Ratchett had not realized it sooner, this was to make sure that he understood the reason of the threats against his life. That letter, as I have said all along, was not intended to be found. The murderer's first care was to destroy it. This, then, was the second hitch in his plans. The first was the snow, the second was our reconstruction of that fragment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会用比较曲折迂回的方式解释给你听。首先你们得意识到那些恐吓信有些瞎蒙的性质，可能是从一本差劲的美国侦探小说里抄的，不是真的。实际上，只是给警方看的。我们必须问自己的就是：‘它们骗到雷切特没有？’表面上看是没有。他给哈德曼的指令好像指的是一个明确的‘个人’的敌人，他完全掌握了敌人的身份，前提是我们认为哈德曼的故事是真的。但是雷切特确实收到了一封风格迥异的信——内容包含阿姆斯特朗小孩的信，也就是我们在他房间发现的碎片。万一雷切特没有及早意识到，就要确保他明白为什么自己的生命受到了威胁。我一直在说的那封信，凶手没打算让人发现，他首先关心的就是烧掉这封信。然而这是他计划中的第二个障碍。第一个是大雪，第二个是我们复原了那封信。">查看中文翻译</div>

Well, there is on the train a certain person connected intimately with the Armstrong family -- a woman. Suppose, then, that you leave there a handkerchief belonging to that woman. She will be questioned, her connection with the Armstrong family will be brought out -- et voilà. Motive -- and an incriminating article of evidence."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, really? That is what you think? That is truly the opinion of the police court. But I know human nature, my friend, and I tell you that, suddenly confronted with the possibility of being tried for murder, the most innocent person will lose their head and do the most absurd things. No, no, the grease spot and the changed label do not prove guilt -- they only prove that the Countess Andrenyi is anxious for some reason to conceal her identity."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，真的吗？你是这么认为的吗？这正是警方的观点。但是我了解人性，我的朋友，面对突如其来的谋杀审讯，就算最清白无辜的人也会失去理智做出最荒唐的事情。不，不，油迹和修改过的标签不能证明安德雷尼伯爵夫人有罪——只能证明她由于某个原因而急于隐瞒身份。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Exactly, and she speaks broken English, and she has a very foreign appearance which she exaggerates. But it should not be difficult to guess who she is. I mentioned just now the name of Mrs. Armstrong's mother. It was Linda Arden, and she was a very celebrated actress -- among other things a Shakespearean actress. Think of As You Like It -- the Forest of Arden and Rosalind. It was there she got the inspiration for her acting name. Linda Arden, the name by which she was known all over the world, was not her real name. It may have been Goldenberg -- she quite likely had central European blood in her veins -- a strain of Jewish, perhaps. Many nationalities drift to America. I suggest to you, gentlemen, that that young sister of Mrs. Armstrong's, little more than a child at the time of the tragedy, was Helena Goldenberg the younger daughter of Linda Arden, and that she married Count Andrenyi when he was an attaché in Washington."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“确切地说，她的英语带有外国口音，相貌也像个外国人[3]，只是有些夸张。但是不难猜到她是谁。刚才我说过阿姆斯特朗太太母亲的名字，叫琳达·阿登，她是个非常著名的演员，尤其是作为一个莎士比亚戏剧的演员。想想《皆大欢喜》中的阿登和罗莎琳德森林。她给自己取名字的灵感即来自于此。那个让她享誉全球的名字，‘琳达·阿登’，并非她的真名。她的本名可能是戈尔登贝格，在她身上，很有可能流淌着中欧人的血，也许掺有犹太人的血液。很多民族都漂泊去了美国。我提示你们一下，先生们，阿姆斯特朗太太的妹妹就是埃伦娜·戈尔登贝格，琳达·阿登的小女儿，惨剧发生时她还是个孩子，后来，嫁给了在华盛顿当使馆专员的安德雷尼伯爵。”【注：[3]这里的外国人，是相对于美国人而言。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Whose name she cannot remember! I ask you, my friends -- is that really likely? Princess Dragomiroff loved Linda Arden as great ladies do love great artists. She was godmother to one of her daughters. Would she forget so quickly the married name of the other daughter? It is not likely. No, I think we can safely say that Princess Dragomiroff was lying. She knew Helena was on the train, she had seen her. She realized at once, as soon as she heard who Ratchett really was, that Helena would be suspected. And so, when we question her as to the sister she promptly lies -- is vague, cannot remember, but 'thinks Helena married an Englishman'-- a suggestion as far away from the truth as possible."</div>
