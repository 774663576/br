<div class="line_en">Then, with time, the squatters were no longer squatters, but owners; and their children grew up and had children on the land. And the hunger was gone from them, the feral hunger, the gnawing, tearing hunger for land, for water and earth and the good sky over it, for the green thrusting grass, for the swelling roots. They had these things so completely that they did not know about them any more. They had no more the stomach-tearing lust for a rich acre and a shining blade to plow it, for seed and a windmill beating its wings in the air. They arose in the dark no more to hear the sleepy birds' first chittering, and the morning wind around the house while they waited for the first light to go out to the dear acres. These things were lost, and crops were reckoned in dollars, and land was valued by principal plus interest, and crops were bought and sold before they were planted. Then crop failure, drought, and flood were no longer little deaths within life, but simple losses of money. And all their love was thinned with money, and all their fierceness dribbled away in interest until they were no longer farmers at all, but little shopkeepers of crops, little manufacturers who must sell before they can make. Then those farmers who were not good shopkeepers lost their land to good shopkeepers. No matter how clever, how loving a man might be with earth and growing things, he could not survive if he were not also a good shopkeeper. And as time went on, the business men had the farms, and the farms grew larger, but there were fewer of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once California belonged to Mexico and its land to Mexicans; and a horde of tattered feverish Americans poured in. And such was their hunger for land that they took the land -- stole Sutter's land, Guerrero's land, took the grants and broke them up and growled and quarreled over them, those frantic hungry men; and they guarded with guns the land they had stolen. They put up houses and barns, they turned the earth and planted crops. And these things were possession, and possession was ownership.</div>

And the farms grew larger and the owners fewer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年年月月，农场老是越来越大，土地的业主们老是越来越少。守在农村经营庄稼的农户简直少得可怜。从国外运来的农奴挨打挨饿，受着恐吓，终于有些人回老家去了，有些人变得很凶，结果被人打死，或是驱逐出境了。农场还是越来越大，土地的业主们却越来越少。">查看中文翻译</div>

Fruit trees took the place of grain fields, and vegetables to feed the world spread out on the bottoms: lettuce, cauliflower, artichokes, potatoes -- stoop crops.

<div class="line_en">And it came about that owners no longer worked on their farms. They farmed on paper; and they forgot the land, the smell, the feel of it, and remembered only that they owned it, remembered only what they gained and lost by it. And some of the farms grew so large that one man could not even conceive of them any more, so large that it took batteries of bookkeepers to keep track of interest and gain and loss; chemists to test the soil, to replenish; straw bosses to see that the stooping men were moving along the rows as swiftly as the material of their bodies could stand. Then such a farmer really became a storekeeper, and kept a store. He paid the men, and sold them food, and took the money back. And after a while he did not pay the men at all, and saved bookkeeping. These farms gave food on credit. A man might work and feed himself; and when the work was done, he might find that he owed money to the company. And the owners not only did not work the farms any more, many of them had never seen the farms they owned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来土地的业主们再也不在农场上工作了。他们在纸上经营农场：他们忘记了土地，忘记了它的气味和感觉，他们只记得自己是土地的业主，只记得他们的盈亏。有些农场大得出奇，竟至无法想像它们的大小，需要一组一组的簿记员计算利息和盈亏；需要许多化验员化验土壤，增添肥料；需要一些工头监视那些弯着腰干活的人是否卖尽气力，在那些农作物的行列中拼命地迅速走动。于是那种农场主实际上就成了一个做买卖的老板，开着一家店铺。他付工资给干活的人，卖食物给他们，又把钱收回来。过些时候，他们干脆就不付工资，连账也不要记了。这些农场用赊账的办法供给食物。工人可以靠干活吃饭；等他把活干完了之后，他也许会发觉他反而欠了公司的账。业主们不但不在农场上工作，他们还有许多人根本就没有看见过自己所拥有的农场。">查看中文翻译</div>

Carloads, caravans, homeless and hungry; twenty thousand and fifty thousand and a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand. They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless -- restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do -- to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut -- anything, any burden to bear, for food. The kids are hungry. We got no place to live. Like ants scurrying for work, for food, and most of all for land.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were hungry, and they were fierce. And they had hoped to find a home, and they found only hatred. Okies -- the owners hated them because the owners knew they were soft and the Okies strong, that they were fed and the Okies hungry; and perhaps the owners had heard from their grandfathers how easy it is to steal land from a soft man if you are fierce and hungry and armed. The owners hated them. And in the towns, the storekeepers hated them because they had no money to spend. There is no shorter path to a storekeeper's contempt, and all his admirations are exactly opposite. The town men, little bankers, hated Okies because there was nothing to gain from them. They had nothing. And the laboring people hated Okies because a hungry man must work, and if he must work, if he has to work, the wage payer automatically gives him less for his work; and then no one can get more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们是饥饿的，他们是凶暴的。他们原来希望找到一个安身之所，结果却只遭到仇恨。俄克佬——业主们恨他们，因为业主们知道自己是软弱的，而俄克佬却很刚强，他们自己吃饱了，而俄克佬却饿着肚子；业主们也许听见他们的祖先说过，只要你凶暴、饥饿而又有了武装，就很容易从一个软弱的人手里把土地夺过去。总之，业主们是恨他们的。在城市里，店主们也恨他们，因为他们花不起钱。最容易遭到店主轻视的无过于这种人，他们是最难得到店主的好感的。城市里的小银行家也恨俄克佬，因为他们从这些人身上得不到任何好处。他们是一无所有的。劳动人民也恨俄克佬，因为饥饿的人必须找工作，既然他必须找工作，非工作不可，老板就自然会把他的工资压低，结果就使别人也无法多得工资了。">查看中文翻译</div>

A man might look at a fallow field and know, and see in his mind that his own bending back and his own straining arms would bring the cabbages into the light, and the golden eating corn, the turnips and carrots.</div>

And the little screaming fact that sounds through all history: repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed. The great owners ignored the three cries of history. The land fell into fewer hands, the number of the dispossessed increased, and every effort of the great owners was directed at repression. The money was spent for arms, for gas to protect the great holdings, and spies were sent to catch the murmuring of revolt so that it might be stamped out. The changing economy was ignored, plans for the change ignored; and only means to destroy revolt were considered, while the causes of revolt went on.</div>
