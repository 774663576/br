<div class="line_en">She said she wouldn't live in her father's empty house either, in the village of Gul Daman, which sat on a steep hill two kilometers north of Herat. She said she wanted to live somewhere removed, detached, where neighbors wouldn't stare at her belly, point at her, snicker, or, worse yet, assault her with insincere kindnesses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说她也不会住进她爸爸的空房子，那座房子在古尔德曼村，坐落在赫拉特城北两公里外一座陡峭的小山丘上。她说她想住在一个遥远的地方，一个与世隔绝的地方，这样就不会有邻居盯着她的大肚子，对她指指点点，嗤之以鼻，甚或更糟糕的，用虚伪的善意来攻击她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Muhsin, Jalil's eldest son by his first wife, Khadija, who suggested the clearing. It was on the outskirts of Gul Daman. To get to it, one took a rutted, uphill dirt track that branched off the main road between Herat and Gul Daman. The track was flanked on either side by knee-high grass and speckles of white and bright yellow flowers. The track snaked uphill and led to a flat field where poplars and cottonwoods soared and wild bushes grew in clusters. From up there, one could make out the tips of the rusted blades of Gul Daman's windmill, on the left, and, on the right, all of Herat spread below. The path ended perpendicular to a wide, trout-filled stream, which rolled down from the Safid-koh mountains surrounding Gul Daman. Two hundred yards upstream, toward the mountains, there was a circular grove of weeping willow trees. In the center, in the shade of the willows, was the clearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提议娜娜住到这片空地的，是扎里勒和第一个妻子卡迪雅所生的长子穆哈辛。它位于古尔德曼村外围。人们若要到这个地方来，得沿着一条坑坑洼洼的泥土路向山上走，这条土路是赫拉特到古尔德曼村的主干道的分岔路，两旁长满了膝盖那么高的杂草，点缀着白色和鲜黄色的花朵。土路向山上盘旋，通向一片平坦的田地，那儿生长着挺拔的白杨树和胡杨树，还有一簇簇的野生灌木。从那儿往上看，山顶有古尔德曼村的风车，那些锈迹斑斑的转叶尖尖的末端依稀可见；至于左下方和右下方，则是开阔的赫拉特城景。山路的末端和一条宽阔的溪流垂直相交；这条山溪从环绕古尔德曼村的沙菲德山脉奔流而下，生长着很多鲑鱼。朝着群峰的方向，再往上游两百来米，有一圈围成圆形的垂柳。树林中间，在柳荫的掩映之下，便是那片林中空地了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, a week before the wedding date, a jinn had entered Nana's body. This required no description to Mariam. She had witnessed it enough times with her own eyes: Nana collapsing suddenly, her body tightening, becoming rigid, her eyes rolling back, her arms and legs shaking as if something were throttling her from the inside, the froth at the corners of her mouth, white, sometimes pink with blood. Then the drowsiness, the frightening disorientation, the incoherent mumbling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，就在举办婚礼那天的前一个星期，妖怪进入了娜娜的身体。无需描绘，玛丽雅姆也知道这是怎么回事。她亲眼见到过很多次了：娜娜突然瘫倒，她的身体绷紧，变得越来越僵硬，不断翻白眼，手舞足蹈，仿佛体内有什么东西在左冲右突，嘴角冒出白沫，有时候还混着鲜红色的血。接着是昏昏欲睡，茫然若失和胡言乱语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And so, your father built us this rathole."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就这样，你的父亲给我们盖了这个老鼠洞。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">NANA HAD ALMOST married once, when she was fifteen. The suitor had been a boy from Shindand, a young parakeet seller. Mariam knew the story from Nana herself, and, though Nana dismissed the episode, Mariam could tell by the wistful light in her eyes that she had been happy. Perhaps for the only time in her life, during those days leading up to her wedding, Nana had been genuinely happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十五岁那年，娜娜差点结婚了。提亲的男孩来自信丹德[1]，那个年轻人以贩卖鹦鹉为生。故事是娜娜自己说给玛丽雅姆听的，虽然娜娜说起这件事时总是若无其事，但从她眼里渴望的光芒中，玛丽雅姆看得出她也曾快乐过。也许娜娜这辈子惟一真正快乐的时候，就是婚礼之前那段日子。【注：[1]Shindand，阿富汗西部城市，位于赫拉特南边。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jalil went there to have a look. When he came back, Nana said, he sounded like a warden bragging about the clean walls and shiny floors of his prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扎里勒到那儿看了一眼。当他回来之后，娜娜说，他说话的口气活像一个不停地吹嘘监狱的墙壁有多么干净、地板有多么光亮的典狱长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Nana told the story, Mariam sat on her lap and pictured her mother being fitted for a wedding dress. She imagined her on horseback, smiling shyly behind a veiled green gown, her palms painted red with henna, her hair parted with silver dust, the braids held together by tree sap. She saw musicians blowing the shahnai flute and banging on dohol drums, street children hooting and giving chase.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="娜娜讲这个故事时，玛丽雅姆坐在她的膝盖上，想像着她母亲正在穿结婚的礼服。她想像她骑着马，穿着绿色的长裙，在面纱之后羞涩地微笑，手掌用指甲花涂得红红的，扑了银粉的头发被分开，扎成的几条辫子用树液粘在一起。她看见奏乐的人吹着笛子，敲打着皮鼓，街头的小孩大呼小叫地在后面追逐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">IN THE CLEARING, Jalil and two of his sons, Farhad and Muhsin, built the small kolba where Mariam would live the first fifteen years of her life. They raised it with sun-dried bricks and plastered it with mud and handfuls of straw. It had two sleeping cots, a wooden table, two straight-backed chairs, a window, and shelves nailed to the walls where Nana placed clay pots and her beloved Chinese tea set. Jalil put in a new cast-iron stove for the winter and stacked logs of chopped wood behind the kolba. He added a tandoor outside for making bread and a chicken coop with a fence around it. He brought a few sheep, built them a feeding trough. He had Farhad and Muhsin dig a deep hole a hundred yards outside the circle of willows and built an outhouse over it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扎里勒和他的两个儿子，法尔哈德和穆哈辛，在空地上盖了一座泥屋，玛丽雅姆将在泥屋中度过生命中的十五个春秋。他们用土砖将它垒起来，然后抹上泥土，盖上几把稻草。泥屋里有两张草席，一张木头桌子，两张直背的椅子，一扇窗户，还有几个固定在墙上的架子，娜娜在架子上摆放陶罐和那套她珍爱的中国茶具。扎里勒搬来过冬用的崭新生铁炉，在泥屋后面堆起砍好的木材。他在屋外加了一只可以用来做面包的烤炉，用篱笆围了养鸡场。他带来了几只绵羊，给它们修了饲料槽。他让法尔哈德和穆哈辛在柳树圈外百来米的地方挖了一个很深的洞，在上面盖了座厕所。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">IN NANA'S ACCOUNT of the day that she gave birth to Mariam, no one came to help. It happened on a damp, overcast day in the spring of 1959, she said, the twenty-sixth year of King Zahir Shah's mostly uneventful forty-year reign. She said that Jalil hadn't bothered to summon a doctor, or even a midwife, even though he knew that the jinn might enter her body and cause her to have one of her fits in the act of delivering. She lay all alone on the kolba's floor, a knife by her side, sweat drenching her body.</div>
