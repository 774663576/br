<div class="line_en">At dusk, the interior of the Great Sept of Baelor turned dim and eerie. The last light of day slanted down through the high windows, washing the towering likenesses of the Seven in a red gloom. Around their altars, scented candles flickered whilst deep shadows gathered in the transepts and crept silently across the marble floors. The echoes of the evensongs died away as the last mourners were departing.</div>

<div class="line_en">"As my lord commands," said Swann. Ser Loras looked as if he might have argued further, but Ser Balon took his arm and drew him off. Jaime listened to the echoes of their footfalls die away. And then he was alone again with his lord father, amongst the candles and the crystals and the sickly sweet smell of death. His back ached from the weight of his armor, and his legs felt almost numb. He shifted his stance a bit and tightened his fingers around the golden greatsword. He could not wield a sword, but he could hold one. His missing hand was throbbing. That was almost funny. He had more feeling in the hand he'd lost than in the rest of the body that remained to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“遵命，大人。”巴隆答应，而洛拉斯爵士似乎还不愿就此让步，直到被巴隆爵士挽起胳膊带走。两名铁卫的脚步声渐行渐远，詹姆又和父亲大人独处一室，陪伴父子俩的唯有蜡烛、水晶和甜腻而腐朽的死亡之气。由于铠甲的重量，他的背阵阵酸痛，双腿几乎麻木，于是他容许自己稍微挪了挪，并将黄金巨剑握得更紧——虽然不能挥它，好歹握还是能握紧的。他的幻影手指蠢蠢欲动。这真讽刺，对他而言，似乎残缺的身躯加在一起都不及失去的那只手神经敏感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My hand is hungry for a sword. I need to kill someone. Varys, for a start, but first I'd need to find the rock he's hiding under. "I commanded the eunuch to take him to a ship, not to your bedchamber," he told the corpse. "The blood is on his hands as much as… as Tyrion's." The blood is on his hands as much as mine, he meant to say, but the words stuck in his throat. Whatever Varys did, I made him do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的手渴望挥剑，而我渴望杀人，从瓦里斯开始，但我首先得找出他的底牌。“我要那太监送他上船，不是送去你的卧室，”他告诉尸体，“太监手上也沾满了您的鲜血，和…和提利昂一样。”和我一样，他想对父亲承认，话语却哽在喉头，说不出口。无论瓦里斯做了什么，始作俑者都是我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had waited in the eunuch's chambers that night, when at last he had decided not to let his little brother die. As he waited, he had sharpened his dagger with one hand, taking a queer comfort from the scrape-scrape-scrape of steel on stone. At the sound of footsteps he stood beside the door. Varys entered in a wash of powder and lavender. Jaime stepped out behind him, kicked him in the back of the knee, knelt on his chest, and shoved the knife up under his soft white chin, forcing his head up. "Why, Lord Varys," he'd said pleasantly, "fancy meeting you here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他决定不能眼睁睁看着弟弟受死之后，便潜入太监的卧室里等到深夜。他边等边用那只完好的手磨匕首，从钢铁与石头摩擦的“刮——刮”声中得到了某种奇特的慰藉。脚步声传来时，他闪到门后，瓦里斯一身厚重脂粉和薰衣草的味道走进来，结果被詹姆从后面出其不意地踢中膝盖窝，扑通倒地。詹姆扑上来，拿自己的膝盖顶住太监的胸膛，抽出匕首指着太监苍白柔软的下巴，强迫他抬头。“巧啊，瓦里斯大人，”他愉快地说，“幸会幸会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had not slept since. He could see his brother now, the way the dwarf had grinned beneath the stub of his nose as the torchlight licked his face. "You poor stupid blind crippled fool," he'd snarled, in a voice thick with malice. "Cersei is a lying whore, she's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and probably Moon Boy for all I know.

<div class="line_en">Jaime wondered where Varys was hiding. Wisely, the master of whisperers had not returned to his own chambers, nor had a search of the Red Keep turned him up. It might be that the eunuch had taken ship with Tyrion, rather than remain to answer awkward questions. If so, the two of them were well out to sea by now, sharing a flagon of Arbor gold in the cabin of a galley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆猜不透瓦里斯目前藏身何处。情报大臣狡诈成性，事发之后便没回过房间，翻遍红堡也没找到关于他的线索。也许他和提利昂一道扬帆出海，得以逃避尴尬的审问。如果是这样，那么此时两人多半已身处狭海之中，在高等舱房里对饮青亭岛的金色葡萄酒了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Down there, it might be years before his bones were found. Jaime had led a dozen guards below, with torches and ropes and lanterns. For hours they had groped through twisting passages, narrow crawl spaces, hidden doors, secret steps, and shafts that plunged down into utter blackness. Seldom had he felt so utterly a cripple. A man takes much for granted when he has two hands. Ladders, for an instance. Even crawling did not come easy; not for nought do they speak of hands and knees. Nor could he hold a torch and climb, as others could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城堡地下，尸体也许要若干年才会被人发现。詹姆曾亲率十几个卫兵带着火炬、绳索和灯笼下去，没日没夜地探索蜿蜒曲折的通路、狭窄的爬行地道、隐藏的暗门、秘密阶梯和伸进无尽幽暗之中的天梯。若非这段经历，他都不晓得自己的残废竟是如此真实，男人一定得有两只手，否则…否则连梯子都不好上，狭窄的走道也不好进——那句成语“手脚并用”可是大实话。最最可悲的是，别人能一手攀爬一手握火炬照明，而他做不到，只好在漆黑一团中小心摸索。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And all for naught. They found only darkness, dust, and rats. And dragons, lurking down below. He remembered the sullen orange glow of the coals in the iron dragon's mouth. The brazier warmed a chamber at the bottom of a shaft where half a dozen tunnels met. On the floor he'd found a scuffed mosaic of the three-headed dragon of House Targaryen done in tiles of black and red. I know you, Kingslayer, the beast seemed to be saying. I have been here all the time, waiting for you to come to me. And it seemed to Jaime that he knew that voice, the iron tones that had once belonged to Rhaegar, Prince of Dragonstone.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="雷加把手放在詹姆肩上。“等战争结束，我准备召开大议会，以求革新政事。这事我很久以前就有计划，可惜…嗯，尚未踏上的道路咱们先别议论。等我班师回朝，再作计议。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Without his beard, Pycelle looked not only old, but feeble. Shaving him was the cruelest thing Tyrion could have done, thought Jaime, who knew what it was to lose a part of yourself, the part that made you who you were. Pycelle's beard had been magnificent, white as snow and soft as lambswool, a luxuriant growth that covered cheeks and chin and flowed down almost to his belt. The Grand Maester had been wont to stroke it when he pontificated. It had given him an air of wisdom, and concealed all manner of unsavory things: the loose skin dangling beneath the old man's jaw, the small querulous mouth and missing teeth, warts and wrinkles and age spots too numerous to count. Though Pycelle was trying to regrow what he had lost, he was failing. Only wisps and tufts sprouted from his wrinkled cheeks and weak chin, so thin that Jaime could see the splotchy pink skin beneath.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ser Jaime, I have seen terrible things in my time," the old man said. "Wars, battles, murders most foul… I was a boy in Oldtown when the grey plague took half the city and three-quarters of the Citadel. Lord Hightower burned every ship in port, closed the gates, and commanded his guards to slay all those who tried to flee, be they men, women, or babes in arms. They killed him when the plague had run its course. On the very day he reopened the port, they dragged him from his horse and slit his throat, and his young son's as well. To this day the ignorant in Oldtown will spit at the sound of his name, but Quenton Hightower did what was needed. Your father was that sort of man as well. A man who did what was needed."</div>

I am not one to boast, but there is royal blood in my veins. I am descended from a princess. My father told me the tale when I was a tad of a lad." Longwaters had not been a tad of a lad for many a year, to judge from his spotted head and the white hairs growing from his chin. "She was the fairest treasure of the Maidenvault. Lord Oakenfist the great admiral lost his heart to her, though he was married to another. She gave their son the bastard name of 'Waters' in honor of his father, and he grew to be a great knight, as did his own son, who put the 'Long' before the 'Waters' so men might know that he was not basely born himself. So I have a little dragon in me."</div>

<div class="line_en">To be sure, his sweet sister seemed to think half the court was either useless or treasonous; Pycelle, the Kingsguard, the Tyrells, Jaime himself… even Ser Ilyn Payne, the silent knight who served as headsman. As King's Justice, the dungeons were his responsibility. Since he lacked a tongue, Payne had largely left the running of those dungeons to his underlings, but Cersei held him to blame for Tyrion's escape all the same. It was my work, not his, Jaime almost told her. Instead he had promised to find what answers he could from the chief undergaoler, a bentback old man named Rennifer Longwaters.</div>

The sept where he'd spent the night was not a third as large as any of the Great Sept's seven transepts. Jaime had laid his sword across the Warrior's knees, piled his armor at his feet, and knelt upon the rough stone floor before the altar. When dawn came his knees were raw and bloody. "All knights must bleed, Jaime," Ser Arthur Dayne had said, when he saw. "Blood is the seal of our devotion." With dawn he tapped him on the shoulder; the pale blade was so sharp that even that light touch cut through Jaime's tunic, so he bled anew. He never felt it. A boy knelt; a knight rose. The Young Lion, not the Kingslayer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的上次守夜迄今已逾多年。那时候我好小好小，才十五岁。当年的他没穿铠甲，只套了一件朴素的白上衣，而他守夜的圣堂不及贝勒大圣堂这七座分堂中任何一座的三分之一大。詹姆将长剑放在战士膝头，把盔甲堆在战士脚边，自己跪在祭坛前粗糙的石板上。黎明到来时，他的膝盖已经红肿出血。“抛洒热血乃是骑士分内之事，詹姆，”亚瑟爵士告诉他，“我们以鲜血捍卫愿心。”然后亚瑟爵士在晨晖照耀中用配剑拍了他的肩膀，苍白的长剑如此锋利，以至于这轻轻一拍竟划破了詹姆的衣服，令他又汩汩流血。可他毫不在意，心中充满狂喜。跪下去的是男孩，站起来的是骑士。一头少年雄狮，并非弑君者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could not have said when the devotions ended. Perhaps he slept, still standing. When the devout had filed out, the Great Sept grew still once more. The candles were a wall of stars burning in the darkness, though the air was rank with death. Jaime shifted his grip upon the golden greatsword. Perhaps he should have let Ser Loras relieve him after all. Cersei would have hated that. The Knight of Flowers was still half a boy, arrogant and vain, but he had it in him to be great, to perform deeds worthy of the White Book.</div>

As the glass in the dome began to lighten, suddenly there were rainbows shimmering off the walls and floors and pillars, bathing Lord Tywin's corpse in a haze of many-colored light. The King's Hand was rotting visibly. His face had taken on a greenish tinge, and his eyes were deeply sunken, two black pits. Fissures had opened in his cheeks, and a foul white fluid was seeping through the joints of his splendid gold-and-crimson armor to pool beneath his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当黎明到来时，詹姆毫无预感。拱顶玻璃逐渐明亮，突然间七彩虹光便洒在墙壁、地板和梁柱上，沐浴着泰温公爵的尸体。前任国王之手腐烂得非常明显。他脸色发绿，眼睛深深塌陷，成为两个漆黑的孔洞，面庞上出现了若干小裂沟，某种难闻的白色液体自那辉煌的红金铠甲关节处渗透出来，在他身下积成了小水池。">查看中文翻译</div>

They sang their songs and prayed their prayers and wrinkled up their noses, and one of the Most Devout grew so faint he had to be helped from the sept. Shortly after, a flock of novices came swinging censers, and the air grew so thick with incense that the bier seemed cloaked in smoke. All the rainbows vanished in that perfumed mist, yet the stench persisted, a sweet rotten smell that made Jaime want to gag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修士们最先进入，来做晨愿。他们自顾自地唱歌、祷告、皱鼻子，其中一位大主教差点晕过去，最后被抬出了圣堂。一群侍僧赶紧过来摇香炉，空气中烟雾缭绕，仿佛为棺材罩上了一层帷幕。虹光穿不透这香甜的迷雾，但臭气仍旧存在，腐败的感觉混合在香味里，令詹姆窒息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你需要提利尔，”詹姆打断瑟曦，“但不需要他留在都城。让他去为托曼攻打风息堡吧，拿出你的魅力，奉承他，告诉他你需要他带兵打仗，需要他代替父亲的位置。梅斯梦想在战场上证明自己。无论他最终把风息堡献上，还是大败亏输、灰溜溜地逃回来，你都是赢家。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆叹口气，“那就赶紧让他们成亲啊。距离托曼能把这桩婚姻圆满还有很多年，在此之前，他们的结合是不算数的，随时可以撤销。把这桩虚伪的婚姻赐予提利尔，换得他鞍前马后地卖命，实在划算。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There is that risk," conceded Jaime. "Especially if his patience runs thin this time, and he elects to storm the gate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是自然，”詹姆续道，“尤其…这是他第二次攻打风息堡…假如他碍不住面子，企图强攻城门的话…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cersei gave him a lingering look. "You know," she said, "for a moment you sounded quite like Father."</div>
