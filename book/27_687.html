<div class="line_en">As the calendar turned from 2009 to 2010, America remained mired in a deep economic malaise. Over the previous two years, nearly 9 million people had lost their jobs in the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Millions more had been hit with foreclosure notices. But in the 1,500-square-mile area south of San Francisco that forms the boundaries of Silicon Valley, animal spirits were stirring again.</div>

<div class="line_en">While the rest of the country licked its wounds from the devastating financial crisis, a new technology boom was getting under way, fueled by several factors. One of them was the wild success of Facebook. In June 2010, the social network's private valuation rose to $23 billion. Six months later, it jumped to $50 billion. Every startup founder in the Valley wanted to be the next Mark Zuckerberg and every VC wanted a seat on the next rocket ship to riches. The emergence of Twitter, which was valued at more than $1 billion in late 2009, added to the excitement.</div>

<div class="line_en">All of this might not have been enough to ignite the new boom, however, if it hadn't been for another key ingredient: rock-bottom interest rates. To rescue the economy, the Federal Reserve had slashed rates to close to zero, making traditional investments like bonds unattractive and sending investors searching for higher returns elsewhere. One of the places they turned to was Silicon Valley.</div>

Wildly popular mobile games like Angry Birds, which millions of iPhone users were paying a dollar each to download, seeded the notion that you could build a business around a smartphone app. In the spring of 2010, an obscure startup called UberCab did a beta launch of its black car hailing service in San Francisco.</div>

<div class="line_en">In January 2010, Theranos had approached Walgreens with an email stating that it had developed small devices capable of running any blood test from a few drops pricked from a finger in real time and for less than half the cost of traditional laboratories. Two months later, Elizabeth and Sunny traveled to Walgreens's headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, Illinois, and gave a presentation to a group of Walgreens executives. Dr. J, who flew up from Pennsylvania for the meeting, instantly recognized the potential of the Theranos technology. Bringing the startup's machines inside Walgreens stores could open up a big new revenue stream for the retailer and be the game changer it had been looking for, he believed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一〇年一月，Theranos寄给沃尔格林一封电邮，表示他们开发了一种小设备，只须在手指上扎几滴血就能即时进行任何检测，成本只需传统实验室的一半不到。两个月后，伊莉莎白和桑尼来到沃尔格林芝加哥总部，座落于伊利诺州迪尔菲尔德近郊。他们向沃尔格林的高层进行演示文稿，J博士也从宾州飞过去参加，他立刻看出Theranos这项技术潜力。若把这家新创公司的机器搬进沃尔格林门市，将为沃尔格林带进新的大笔营收，达到其长久追求的目标——成为改变市场游戏规则的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dr. J's real name was Jay Rosan and he was in fact a doctor, though he had spent most of his career working for big corporations. He was a member of Walgreens's innovation team, which was tasked with identifying new ideas and technologies that could reboot growth at the 109-year-old drugstore chain. Dr. J operated out of an office in the Philadelphia suburb of Conshohocken that Walgreens had inherited from its 2007 acquisition of Take Care Health Systems, an operator of in-store clinics where he'd previously been employed.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few minutes before eight a. m. on August 24, 2010, a group of rental cars pulled up in front of 3200 Hillview Avenue in Palo Alto. A stocky man with glasses and dimples on his wide nose stepped out of one of them. His name was Kevin Hunter and he headed a small lab consulting firm called Colaborate. He was part of a Walgreens delegation led by Dr. J that had flown to California for a two-day meeting with Theranos. The drugstore chain had hired him a few weeks before to help evaluate and set up a partnership it was negotiating with the startup.</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't just the business proposition that appealed to Dr. J. A health nut who carefully watched his diet, rarely drank alcohol, and was fanatical about getting a swim in every day, he was passionate about empowering people to live healthier lives. The picture Elizabeth presented at the meeting of making blood tests less painful and more widely available so they could become an early warning system against disease deeply resonated with him. That evening, he could barely contain his excitement over dinner at a wine bar with two Walgreens colleagues who weren't privy to the secret discussions with Theranos. After asking them to keep what he was about to tell them confidential, he revealed in a hushed tone that he'd found a company he was convinced would change the face of the pharmacy industry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hunter had a special affinity for the business Walgreens was in: his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had all been pharmacists. Growing up, he'd spent the summers helping his dad man the counter and stock the shelves of the pharmacies he ran on air bases in New York, Texas, and New Mexico. As familiar as he was with drugstores, though, Hunter's real expertise was with clinical laboratories. After getting his MBA at the University of Florida, he had spent the first eight years of his career working for Quest Diagnostics, the giant provider of lab services. He had subsequently launched Colaborate, which advised clients ranging from hospitals to private equity firms about laboratory issues.</div>

They were joined there by Daniel Young, who had succeeded Seth Michelson as head of Theranos's biomath team. On the Walgreens side, in addition to Hunter and Dr. J, three others had made the trip: a Belgian executive named Renaat Van den Hooff, a financial executive named Dan Doyle, and Jim Sundberg, who worked with Hunter at Colaborate.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm so excited that we're doing this!" Dr. J then exclaimed. He was referring to a pilot project the companies had agreed to. It would involve placing Theranos's readers in thirty to ninety Walgreens stores no later than the middle of 2011. The stores' customers would be able to get their blood tested with just a prick of the finger and receive their results in under an hour. A preliminary contract had already been signed, under which Walgreens had committed to prepurchase up to $50 million worth of Theranos cartridges and to loan the startup an additional $25 million. If all went well with the pilot, the companies would aim to expand their partnership nationwide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我好高兴我们开始了！」J博士接着大声说。他指的是两家公司已经同意的试验计划：最晚到二〇一一年中，Theranos的读卡机会进驻沃尔格林三十至九十家门市，消费者只要扎手指就能做血液检测，一个小时内就能知道结果。初步合约已经签妥，沃尔格林承诺除了预购价值五千万美元的读卡机，再借二千五百万给Theranos。若试验计划进行顺利，双方合作将扩大到全国范围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dr. J high-fived Sunny and Elizabeth, then sat down and kicked off the meeting with the same line he always used when he introduced himself: "Hi, I'm Dr. J and I used to play basketball." Hunter had already heard him use it a dozen times in the few weeks they'd worked together and no longer thought it was funny, but for Dr. J it was a joke that never seemed to grow old. It elicited a few awkward chuckles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="J博士先跟桑尼、伊莉莎白击掌打招呼，便坐下开始会议，他搬出每次自我介绍所用的台词：「嗨，我是J博士，以前打篮球。」（译按：美国职篮NBA球星朱利叶斯．厄文［Julius Erving］绰号也叫J博士。）共事这几个星期以来，杭特已经听他用了不下十几次，不再觉得好笑，不过他似乎觉得这个笑话永远不嫌老。现场一阵尴尬窃笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About half an hour into discussions centering on the pilot, Hunter asked where the bathroom was. Elizabeth and Sunny visibly stiffened. Security was paramount, they said, and anyone who left the conference room would have to be escorted. Sunny accompanied Hunter to the bathroom, waited for him outside the bathroom door, and then walked him back to the conference room. It seemed to Hunter unnecessary and strangely paranoid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="针对试验计划的讨论进行了半小时后，杭特询问洗手间在哪里。伊莉莎白和桑尼两人明显僵硬起来，他们说，维安是最高指导原则，任何人离开会议室都必须有人护送。于是桑尼陪杭特前往洗手间，在外头等着，然后再陪他走回会议室。这些举动在杭特看来没有任何必要，简直疑神疑鬼到诡异的地步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was unusual for Walgreens to move this quickly. Opportunities the innovation team identified usually got waylaid in internal committees and slowed down by the retailer's giant bureaucracy. Dr. J had managed to fast-track this one by going straight to Wade Miquelon, Walgreens's chief financial officer, and getting him behind the project. Miquelon was due to fly in that evening and join them at the next day's session.</div>

<div class="line_en">On his way back from the bathroom, he scanned the office for a laboratory but didn't see anything that looked like one. That's because it was downstairs, he was told.

<div class="line_en">Theranos had told Walgreens it had a commercially ready laboratory and had provided it with a list of 192 different blood tests it said its proprietary devices could handle. In reality, although there was a lab downstairs, it was just an R&amp;D lab where Gary Frenzel and his team of biochemists conducted their research. Moreover, half of the tests on the list couldn't be performed as chemiluminescent immunoassays, the testing technique the Edison system relied on. They required different testing methods beyond the Edison's scope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Theranos跟沃尔格林提过，他们有个随时可商用运转的实验室，还提供了份清单，上面列了一百九十二种血液检测项目，说是他们专属机器可处理的检测。实情则是：楼下虽然有个实验室，但只是盖瑞．法兰佐和生化团队做研究的研发实验室；而清单所列的检验，有半数不能采用化学发光免疫测定（这是爱迪生系统仰仗的检测方法），需要动用其他各种不同方法，而这非爱迪生能力所及。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The meeting resumed and stretched into the middle of the afternoon, at which point Elizabeth suggested they grab an early dinner in town. As they got up from their chairs, Hunter asked again to see the lab. Elizabeth tapped Dr. J on the shoulder and motioned for him to follow her outside the conference room. He returned moments later and told Hunter it wasn't going to happen. Elizabeth wasn't willing to show them the lab yet, he said. Instead, Sunny showed the Walgreens team his office. There was a sleeping bag on the floor behind his desk, his bathroom had a shower in it, and he kept a change of clothes on hand. He worked such long hours that on many nights he crashed at the office, he proudly told the visitors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议持续开到下午，这时伊莉莎白提议到附近提早吃个晚餐。众人从椅子上起身时，杭特再度要求看看实验室，伊莉莎白轻拍J博士的肩头，示意他随她走出会议室。几分钟后J博士回来告诉杭特，今天没办法，伊莉莎白还不愿意让他们参观实验室，反倒是桑尼领着众人去参观他的办公室。他的办公桌后方地上有个睡袋，洗手间里有淋浴设备，他还随时准备一套换洗衣物。他得意洋洋地告诉访客们，他的工作时间太长，晚上常常在办公室倒头就睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

With her black turtleneck, her deep voice, and the green kale shakes she sipped on all day, Elizabeth was going to great lengths to emulate Steve Jobs, but she didn't seem to have a solid understanding of what distinguished different types of blood tests. Theranos had also failed to deliver on his two basic requests: to let him see its lab and to demonstrate a live vitamin D test on its device.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杭特的猜疑愈来愈强烈。黑色高领上衣、低沉嗓音，还有她整天不停啜饮的手摇绿色蔬菜汁，伊莉莎白不遗余力在模仿贾伯斯，但是对血液检验各个种类的明显差异却似乎不甚了解，而且Theranos并没有做到他提出的两个基本要求：让他看看实验室，以及用其设备现场示范维他命D检测。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they headed out to eat, Sunny and Elizabeth made them leave at staggered intervals. They didn't want everyone to arrive at the restaurant at the same time on the grounds that it risked attracting notice. They also instructed Hunter and his colleagues not to use names. When Hunter got to the restaurant, a little sushi place on El Camino Real called Fuki Sushi, the hostess took him to a private room in the back with sliding doors where Elizabeth was waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前往用餐地点时，桑尼和伊莉莎白要众人错开出发时间，不希望所有人同时到达餐厅，理由是避免惹人注意。他们还吩咐杭特一伙人不要用名字相称。杭特一抵达餐厅——位于王者之道（El Camino Real）的小寿司店「富贵寿司」（Fuki Sushi）——就被领进后方带有拉门的隐密包厢，伊莉莎白已经在里头等候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="不过，J博士似乎没有杭特这些猜疑，他显然迷倒在伊莉莎白的光环下，也陶醉于硅谷的氛围之中。他让杭特想起追星族，大老远从美国东岸来到西岸，只为了参加喜爱乐团的演唱会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they reconvened at the Theranos office the next morning, they were joined by Wade Miquelon, the Walgreens CFO. Wade had negotiated the pilot contract directly with Elizabeth. He too seemed to be a big fan of hers. Midway through that day's meeting, Elizabeth made a big show of giving Miquelon an American flag that she said had been flown over a battlefield in Afghanistan. She'd written a dedication to Walgreens on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔天早上，他们再度来到Theranos办公室开会，这次沃尔格林财务长魏德．密克隆一同与会。魏德曾经跟伊莉莎白直接洽谈试验计划的合约，似乎也变成她的大粉丝。会议开到一半，伊莉莎白演了场大戏，送给密克隆一面美国国旗，她说这面国旗曾经飘扬于阿富汗战场，她在上面签名献给沃尔格林。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hunter's plan had been to have Theranos test his and Dr. J's blood, then get retested at Stanford Hospital that evening and compare the results. He'd even arranged for a pathologist to be on standby at the hospital to write the order and draw their blood. But Elizabeth claimed she'd been given too little notice even though he'd made the request two weeks ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杭特原本计划请Theranos检测他和J博士的血液，然后当晚他们再去斯坦福医院检测，比对两份结果。他甚至安排了病理师在医院待命，随时可填写检测单并替他们抽血，但是伊莉莎白却宣称这项要求太晚提出，来不及准备，可是他明明两周前就已提出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was something else that bothered Hunter: Sunny's attitude. He acted both superior and cavalier. When the Walgreens side had broached bringing its IT department in on the pilot preparations, Sunny had dismissed the idea out of hand by saying, "IT are like lawyers, avoid them as long as possible." That kind of approach sounded to Hunter like a recipe for problems.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一件事令杭特困惑：桑尼的态度，他一副高高在上又漫不经心的样子。沃尔格林提出想将IT部门引进试验计划中，桑尼立刻驳回，他说：「IT跟律师一样，能免则免。」在杭特听来，这种处理事情的态度势必会引来大乱子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hunter thought the whole thing was bizarre. Walgreens had brought him here to vet Theranos's technology, but he hadn't been allowed to do so. The only thing they had to show for their visit was an autographed flag. And yet, Dr. J and Miquelon didn't seem to mind. As far as they were concerned, the visit had gone swimmingly.</div>

<div class="line_en">A month later, in September 2010, a group of Walgreens executives met with Elizabeth and Sunny in a conference room at the drugstore chain's Deerfield headquarters. The mood was festive. Red balloons with the Walgreens logo floated above a table laden with hors d'oeuvres. Wade Miquelon and Dr. J were unveiling "Project Beta," the code name for the Theranos pilot, to senior Walgreens executives.</div>

<div class="line_en">Standing in front of a slide titled "Disrupting the Lab Industry" projected on a big screen, one of the Walgreens executives was singing along to "Imagine." To celebrate the alliance, the innovation team had come up with the idea of adapting the lyrics to the John Lennon song and using it as the partnership's anthem. When the awkward karaoke act was over, Elizabeth and Sunny encouraged the Walgreens executives to get their blood tested. They had brought along several black-and-white machines to the meeting. The Walgreens executives lined up to get their fingers pricked behind Kermit Crawford, the president of the pharmacy business, and Colin Watts, the head of the innovation team.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a report he'd put together after the Palo Alto visit, Hunter had warned that Theranos might be "overselling or overstating… where they are at scientifically with the cartridges/devices." He'd also recommended that Walgreens embed someone at Theranos through the pilot's launch and had volunteered one of his Colaborate colleagues, a petite British woman by the name of June Smart who'd recently completed a stint administering Stanford's labs, for the assignment. Theranos had rejected the idea.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hunter asked about the blood-test results a few days later on the weekly video conference call the companies were using as their primary mode of communication. Elizabeth responded that Theranos could only release the results to a doctor.

They agreed that Sunny would follow up separately with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hunter's patience was wearing thin. During that week's call, the two sides discussed a sudden change Theranos had made to its regulatory strategy. It had initially represented that its blood tests would qualify as "waived" under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, the 1988 federal law that governed laboratories. CLIA-waived tests usually involved simple laboratory procedures that the Food and Drug Administration had cleared for home use.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杭特的耐心快要消磨殆尽。那个星期的例行视频会议上，双方谈到Theranos突然变更其因应政府监管的作法。Theranos一开始的说法是，他们的血液检测会符合「临床实验室改进修正案」（CLIA，一九八八年颁布的联邦法律，用于监管实验室）认定的「豁免」（waived）标准。CLIA认定的「豁免」检测，通常是食品药物管理局——FDA认定可在家自己做的检测，只涉及简单的实验室流程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, Theranos was changing its tune and saying the tests it would be offering in Walgreens stores were "laboratory-developed tests." It was a big difference: laboratory-developed tests lay in a gray zone between the FDA and another federal health regulator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. CMS, as the latter agency was known, exercised oversight of clinical laboratories under CLIA, while the FDA regulated the diagnostic equipment that laboratories bought and used for their testing. But no one closely regulated tests that labs fashioned with their own methods. Elizabeth and Sunny had a testy exchange with Hunter over the significance of the change. They maintained that all the big laboratory companies mostly used laboratory-developed tests, which Hunter knew not to be true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在Theranos改口表示，他们在沃尔格林门市提供的检测项目是「实验室自行研发的检验」（LDT，译按：是指医学实验室自行研究发展、制造、验证且仅供该实验室使用的检测方法）。这前后改变的差异很大：LDT正好介于FDA和另一联邦医疗监管单位「联邦医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心」（CMS）的灰色地带。CMS是根据CLIA来监管临床实验室，而FDA监管的是实验室购买用来检测的诊断仪器，但是，没有任何单位监管实验室用自行研发方法所进行的检测。针对这项重大改变，伊莉莎白和桑尼跟杭特有一段火爆对话，他们坚持所有大型实验室最常用的检测就是LDT，杭特知道那不是事实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="「不好，我们不希望在这个时候做这件事，」她说，很快把话题转移到其他议程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To Hunter, the switch made it all the more important to check the accuracy of Theranos's tests. He suggested doing a fifty-patient study in which they would compare Theranos results to ones from Stanford Hospital. He'd done work with Stanford and knew people there; it would be easy to arrange. On the computer screen, Hunter noticed an immediate change in Elizabeth's body language. She became visibly guarded and defensive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在杭特听来，这项变更代表更迫切需要检查Theranos检测的准确性。他当场建议进行五十个病人的研究，比较Theranos和斯坦福医院的检测结果，他跟斯坦福医院合作过，那里有认识的人，要安排很容易。透过电脑屏幕，杭特注意到伊莉莎白的身体语言立刻改变，明显变成防御戒备状态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After they hung up, Hunter took aside Renaat Van den Hooff, who was in charge of the pilot on the Walgreens side, and told him something just wasn't right. The red flags were piling up. First, Elizabeth had denied him access to their lab. Then she'd rejected his proposal to embed someone with them in Palo Alto. And now she was refusing to do a simple comparison study. To top it all off, Theranos had drawn the blood of the president of Walgreens's pharmacy business, one of the company's most senior executives, and failed to give him a test result!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议结束后，杭特把瑞纳（Renaat，沃尔格林负责这项市场测试者）拉到一旁，告诉他事有蹊跷，警讯愈来愈多。首先，伊莉莎白不让他进入实验室，接着拒绝他派人到帕罗奥图跟他们共事，现在连个简单的比对研究都不肯做。更重要的是，Theranos已经采集沃尔格林药局事业总裁（沃尔格林最资深的高层之一）的血液，却给不出检测结果！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Walgreens's rivalry with CVS, which was based in Rhode Island and one-third bigger in terms of revenues, colored virtually everything the drugstore chain did. It was a myopic view of the world that was hard to understand for an outsider like Hunter who wasn't a Walgreens company man. Theranos had cleverly played on this insecurity. As a result, Walgreens suffered from a severe case of FoMO -- the fear of missing out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="CVS的大本营在罗德岛（Rhode Island），营收比沃尔格林多三分之一。沃尔格林跟CVS的敌对竞争，几乎左右了沃尔格林的一举一动，这种短视世界观是杭特这种局外人很难了解的，Theranos很巧妙地利用这种不安全感，结果造成沃尔格林深陷于严重的FoMO症候群（fear of missing out）——害怕错过的恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hunter pleaded with Van den Hooff to at least let him peek inside the one black-and-white reader Theranos had left with them after the Project Beta kickoff party. He was dying to tear the strips of security tape off its case and crack it open. Theranos had sent them some test kits for it, but they were for obscure blood tests like a "flu susceptibility" panel that no other lab he knew of offered. It was therefore impossible to compare their results to anything. How convenient, Hunter had noted. Moreover, the kits were expired.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杭特恳求瑞纳至少让他偷看一下Theranos那台黑白读卡机的内部，那是Theranos在贝塔计划启动派对结束后所留下的，他很想撕掉外壳上的保密胶布，一探究竟。Theranos确实送来一些检测套组，但都是用于很少人做的检测，像是「流感感染性」，就他所知没有实验室有提供这种检测，所以不可能拿Theranos的结果跟其他实验室比对。多么顺利成章啊，杭特心想，更何况那些检测套组还过期了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Trying to contain his frustration, Hunter made one last request. Theranos always invoked two things as proof that its technology had been vetted. The first was the clinical trial work it did for pharmaceutical companies. Documents it gave Walgreens stated that the Theranos system had been "comprehensively validated over the last seven years by ten of the largest fifteen pharma companies." The second was a review of its technology Dr. J had supposedly commissioned from Johns Hopkins University's medical school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杭特努力压抑内心的失望，做出最后一个请求。Theranos老是拿两个东西证明他们的技术接受过审查，一个是他们替大药厂做的临床试验，他们提供给沃尔格林的文档上表示：Theranos系统「过去七年已广泛获得十五家大药厂其中十家验证有效」。另一个是针对Theranos技术的审核书，是J博士委托约翰霍普金斯大学医学院（JHUSOM）所做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Van den Hooff said no. In addition to signing confidentiality agreements, they'd been sternly warned not to tamper with the reader.

<div class="line_en">Hunter told Van den Hooff the letter was meaningless. Judging from the Belgian's expression, he sensed that he was starting to make headway. Van den Hooff's confidence seemed shaken. Hunter knew that Dan Doyle, the executive responsible for the innovation team's finances, shared some of his skepticism. If he could convert Van den Hooff to their point of view, they might get Dr. J and Wade Miquelon to see the light and avert a potential disaster.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Hunter was done reading it, he almost laughed. It was a letter dated April 27, 2010, summarizing a meeting Elizabeth and Sunny had had with Dr. J and five university representatives on the Hopkins campus in Baltimore. It stated that they had shown the Hopkins team "proprietary data on test performance" and that Hopkins had deemed the technology "novel and sound."

<div class="line_cn" title="J博士有个有力的盟友是魏德．密克隆。一身俐落穿着，喜欢高价西装和名牌眼镜的魏德，非常善于交际，在沃尔格林广受喜爱。不过，《芝加哥论坛报》（Chicago Tribune）刊出一篇报导后，很多同事开始怀疑他的判断能力。报导中指出他那年秋天酒驾被捕，是短短一年内的第二次，他甚至根本不该坐上驾驶座，因为他的驾照仍处于第一次被捕后的吊销期。更糟糕的是，他拒绝接受酒测仪检测，也没通过现场的清醒测试。事件过后，沃尔格林总部走廊上开始给他一个新绰号：密克罗（Michelob，译按：为啤酒品牌，发音近似魏德．密克隆［Wade Miquelon］的姓）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wade's DUIs and Dr. J's blind cheerleading for Theranos didn't inspire confidence that Project Beta was in the best hands. But that was beyond Hunter's purview. He focused on what he could control, continuing to ask tough questions on the weekly video calls until one day in early 2011 Lipinski told him that Elizabeth and Sunny no longer wanted him on the calls or in meetings between the companies. They felt that he was creating too much tension and that it interfered with getting work done, she said. Walgreens had no choice but to comply or Theranos would walk away, she added.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魏德的酒驾以及J博士对Theranos的盲目相挺，并没有让人相信贝塔计划托付在对的人手中，不过这不属于杭特的权限范围，他只能专注于自己能掌控的事，继续在每周的视频会议提出犀利问题。直到二〇一一年初某天，翠许告诉他，伊莉莎白和桑尼不希望他再参加两家公司的视频或当面会议，他们觉得他制造太多紧张，干扰事务推展。沃尔格林没有选择，只能乖乖照办，不然Theranos就不玩了，她补充说明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hunter tried to convince her to rebuff the demand. Why was Walgreens paying his firm $25,000 a month to look out for its best interests if it was going to keep him at arm's length and make it harder for him to do his job? It made no sense. His protestations were politely ignored and Elizabeth and Sunny got their way. Hunter continued to work with the innovation team and to provide his expertise when asked, but his exclusion from subsequent calls and meetings marginalized him and limited his input.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杭特想说服她回绝这种要求。沃尔格林一个月付他二万五千美元，请他谋求公司最大利益，现在竟然要求他不要插手，阻挠他做分内工作？这毫无道理。结果，他的抗议遭到礼貌性忽视，伊莉莎白和桑尼得其所愿。杭特虽然仍继续待在创新团队，必要时提供自身专业，但因为被排除后续会议之外，他的角色逐渐边缘化，能参与的部分有限。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the meantime, Walgreens pushed ahead with the project. As part of the pilot preparations, Hunter joined the innovation team on a field trip to an unmarked warehouse in an industrial park a few miles from the Deerfield campus. Inside, the company had built a full-scale replica of one of its stores. It featured a blood-testing laboratory, with shelves designed specifically to accommodate the dimensions of the black-and-white Theranos readers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同一时间，沃尔格林持续大力推动贝塔计划。为了该计划，杭特和创新团队到几英里外的工业区参观一个隐密仓库，在仓库里，公司以原尺寸复制了一间门市，里面有血液检验实验室，架子还特别依照Theranos的黑白读卡机尺寸来设计，以方便容纳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seeing the mock store and its little lab brought home to Hunter how real it all was. Soon, actual patients were going to get their blood drawn and tested in one of these, he thought uneasily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到仿真门市和小实验室，杭特更清楚意识到这一切都是真的。再过不久，真的会有病人在这些地方抽血、验血，他不安地想着。">查看中文翻译</div>
