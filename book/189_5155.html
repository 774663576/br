<div class="line_en">They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion?</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no experienced person. These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when -- the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection -- he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗斯伯力先生跟她们一块儿来到伦敦，还要在这儿住两天。但露丝深知这位杰出的绅士性情急躁，她清楚地预见到，他一听就会勃然大怒，对再次拐走奥立弗的傀儡恨得七窍生烟，所以露丝不敢将秘密向他和盘托出，除非她替那个姑娘进行的辩解能够得到有经验的人支持。这些也是在把这件事告诉梅莱夫人的时候必须极其谨慎，举止分毫不乱的理由，老太太的头一阵冲动准是去找那位可敬的大夫商量。至于请教哪一位法律顾问，即使她知道该怎么请教，由于相同的理由，恐怕也很难加以考虑。她一度考虑争取得到哈利的帮助，可这个念头却唤起了对最后一次分别的记忆，她似乎不配叫他回来――泪水随着这一连串的回忆涌上了双眼――此时他或许已经学会如何将她淡忘，懂得排遣惆怅了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver's history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie's heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的的确确，露丝面临着一次非同寻常的考验，处境十分困难。她心急如焚，想要把牵连到奥立弗的身世的秘密搞个水落石出，刚刚与自己交谈过的那个可怜的女子是如此信赖她这样一个纯真的少女，她不能不将这种信任看得十分神圣。她的言谈举止打动了露丝梅莱的心，与她对自己所保护的那个孩子的爱心融合在一起的，还有在真挚和热情方面几乎毫不逊色的一个心愿，争取让这个流浪的姑娘迷途知返，重新作人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她已经第五十次将同一支笔拿起来，又放下，反复考虑这封信的头一行该怎么写，但又一个字也写不出来，就在这时，在凯尔司先生护卫下上街散步的奥立弗上气不接下气地走进了房间，从他按捺不住的激动来看，似乎又有什么令人不安的事情发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露丝度过了一个顾虑重重的不眠之夜，她思绪万千，各种各样的考虑依次出现在她的脑海里，她忽而倾向于这一种方法，忽而倾向于那一种办法，忽而又全部推翻。第二天，她考虑再三，终于顾不了那么多，决定请哈利来商量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If it be painful to him," she thought, "to come back here, how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me -- he did when he went away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both." And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果他回到这个地方感到痛苦的话，”她想道，“我该会多么痛苦啊！不过，他也许不来，他可以写信相对性和近似性。断言认识论是建立在反映万物最一般规律，或者他人倒是来了，却故意避开我――他走的时候就是这样。我简直没有想到他会这样，可这对我们俩反而更好。”想到这里，露丝放下了笔，转过脸去，仿佛不愿意让即将替自己担任使者的信笺看见她在哭泣似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥立弗根本用不着催促，不出五分钟，他们已经坐上马车直奔格雷文街。到了那个地方，露丝将奥立弗留在马车里，借口老绅士接见他也需要准备准备，她让仆人送上自己的名片，说有非常要紧的事求见布朗罗先生。仆人不多一会就回来了，请她立即上楼。露丝小姐跟着仆人走进楼上的一个房间，见到一位慈眉善目，身穿墨绿色外套的老先生。在离他不远的地方坐着另一位穿淡黄马裤、裹着皮绑腿的老绅士，看上去就不太和气，双手交叉，按在一根粗大的手杖上，托住自己的下巴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话刚从她口中说出来，装出正在测览桌上放着的一本大书的格林维格先生就把书给翻了个身，发出哗啦一声巨响，他身子一仰靠在椅背上，脸上所有的表情都不见了，只剩下百分之百的惊异，瞪大眼睛，视而不见地愣了半天，接着，他好像对自己的心情居然这样暴露无余感到有些难为情，他身子猛然一扭，又恢复了刚才的姿势，两眼直视前方，接着发出一声悠长而又深沉的口哨，这一声口哨最后好像不是飘散在空中，而是渐渐消失在他胃部那些深不可测的坑洼里。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature." Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.</div>

<div class="line_en">Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布朗罗先生丢下她和奥立弗去畅叙阔别之情，领着露丝走进另一个房间。在那里，他听露丝讲了她与南希见面的全部经过，不禁感到大为震惊和惶惑。露丝还解释了没有立刻向她家的朋友罗斯伯力先生露出一点口风的原因，老先生认为她做得相当谨慎，并且欣然答应亲自与那位可敬的大夫进行一次严肃的会谈。为了让他早一些实施这一计划，随即商定当天晚上八点钟由他到旅馆作一次拜访，与此同时，发生的所有事情都应该谨慎小心地通知梅莱夫人。这些预备措施安排停当，露丝与奥立弗便回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath. Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对那位好心的大夫发起火来会达到什么程度，露丝绝非估计过高。南希的来历刚一向他摊开，警告与诅咒就像瓢泼大雨一样从他口中倾泻而出，他扬言要请布拉瑟斯先生和达福先生共同出谋划策，将南希头一个捉拿归案，他当场戴上帽子，准备立刻出发以得到那两位名探的帮助。毫无疑问，在一时性起之下，他会将这种意图付诸实施，丝毫也不考虑后果，幸好他受到了阻止，这一方面是由于布朗罗先生以不相上下的激烈态度加以阻拦，他也有一副火暴脾气，另一方面则是大家提出了种种论证和主张，用这些理由来打消他轻举妄动的念头似乎再合适不过了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him. He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray," said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. "The promise shall be kept. I don't think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself."</div>

"And as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver's tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world."</div>
