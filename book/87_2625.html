<div class="line_en">The room that the elevator had led to was unlike any other part of the estate she'd seen. It lacked the strange, fetid charm of the mansion, or the dripping gloom of the underground. It was as though she'd walked out of a gothic horror story and into a military complex, a utilitarian's bleak paradise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="升降机将吉尔带到了一个房间里，她发现这里与之前所看到的斯宾塞家族私有领地的其他地方是不一样的。这里没有别墅里奇怪的恶臭以及地下通道中那种潮湿的压抑感。就好像是离开了哥特式的恐布世界，来到了军事设施以及功利主义者的荒凉天堂中的感觉一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill had taken the elevator into what seemed to be another part of the garden or courtyard, although the area had been isolated, surrounded by trees; she'd guessed as much from the few overgrown potted plants and the welcome sounds of the forest beyond the low metal railing. There had been nothing to see but a rusting door set into a nondescript, overgrown wall, welded shut and a large, open well, like a stone wading pool. Inside had been a short, spiral staircase leading down to another small elevator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔搭乘上了通往庭园或者中庭其他的地方的升降机，当机器停下来之后一看，那里被树木所包围，好像是被单独孤立起来的一个地方。在茂盛的盆栽植物以及低矮的金属围栏对面，树叶在沙沙作响，听上去应该是一片树林。四周的墙壁被亮无特征的草所覆盖，一道生锈的铁门焊接在墙壁之中。此外还有一口很大的，井其内部有短小的螺旋楼梯，尽头处还有一架小型升降机。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was standing in a large, steel-reinforced concrete room, the walls painted a muddy industrial orange. Metal ducts and overhead pipes lined the upper walls, and the room was rather aptly titled "XD-R Bl," painted across the concrete in black, several feet high. Any sense she'd had of where she was in relation to the rest of the estate was totally gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔身处在一个用钢铁强化起来的混凝土建造的空间里，甚至墙壁都被涂成了富有重工其色彩的橘黄色。金属的导管在墙壁的上方整齐地排列着。在几英尺的上方用黑色油漆写着“XD-RB1”的字样。一个很适合这个空间的名字。完全感受不到这个地方与私有领地中其他的地方有什么关联性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a heavy metal door on one side of the room, firmly locked. The sign to the left of it stated that it was only to be opened in case of a first-class emergency. She figured that the "Bl" on the wall stood for "Basement level one," her theory confirmed by the bolted ladder that led down through a narrow shaft in the concrete; where there was Bl, B2 naturally followed.</div>

<div class="line_en">She held the shotgun ready and walked slowly toward the stairs, noting that there was a hall branch-ing off to the left where the railing stopped. She darted a quick look around the corner and saw that it was clear. Still watching the desiccated corpse carefully, she edged down the short corridor and stopped at the door on her left. The sign next to the door read "Visual Data Room," and the door itself was unlocked.</div>

<div class="line_en">It opened up into a still, gray room with a long meeting table in the center, a slide projector set up in front of a portable screen at the far end.

<div class="line_cn" title="灰色的房间里十分安静，中央摆放着会议用的方形长桌，在轻便式的幕布前面有一台投影机。右侧的墙壁上有一架电话。吉尔向电话走去，虽然心里知道还是不要抱太大的希望，但调查一下总是没有坏处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a flat bar at the top. She touched it lightly, and the panel slid down into the wall, revealing a large red button. She looked around the quiet room, trying to imagine what the trap would be and then realized that there wouldn't be a trap at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔轻一碰上面的扁钢，控制台便回到墙壁里，然后出现了一个很大的红色按钮。吉尔一边在安静的房间里环视着，一边在想这到底是个什么样的机关。接着，她意识到这个根本不什么机关。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't a phone at all, but an intercom system that didn't seem to work. Sighing, she stepped past an ornamental pillar and walked around the table, glancing at the empty slide projector.

Jill stepped over to take a closer look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这根本不是电话，而是一个似乎不起作用的内部通讯系统。她叹了口气，走过一根装饰性的柱子，绕着桌子走去，瞥了一眼空荡荡的幻灯机。她让她的目光四处游荡，寻找任何感兴趣的东西，它停在墙上一块平平的、毫无特色的金属制成的四方形控制板，大约有一张纸那么大。吉尔走过来仔细看了看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The twisted, gnarled root of Plant 42 took up a large corner of the basement room, the bulk of it hanging down in slender, fleshy tendrils that almost touched the floor. A few of the tiny, worm-like threads squirmed blindly around each other, twisting slowly back and forth as if looking for the water supply that Chris had drained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="42号植物弯曲的根部占领了地下室的一角，细嫩肉质的须根从天花板上垂下来，刚刚能够碰到地板。爬满了小虫的纤维在盲目地互相缠绕，并慢慢地前后摆动，看上去好像在寻找被克里斯排干了的水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chris nodded agreement. Besides the control room he'd escaped into, there had only been two other chambers in the basement. One of them had been stacked with boxes of cartridges for all kinds of weapons and although most of them had been uselessly wet, he'd found most of a box of nine-millimeter rounds on a high shelf, saving them both from running out of ammunition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯点了点头。除了他逃进的那个控制室之外，地下室里还有两个房间。一个是放有各种武器的仓库——当然，那些武器被水泡得已经无法使用了。不过克里斯在最上面的架子上发现了大量的手枪子弹，所以至少解决了弹药的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was a hissing, crackling sound like wet wood thrown atop a blazing fire and within seconds, the feebly twisting fibers started to break, pieces of them snapping off and flaking away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，从根部升腾起一股红色的烟雾。瑞贝卡将瓶子中的液体全都倒出，并迅速向后退开几步。这时房间里响起了好像将湿木头仍进火堆中时发出的“嘶嘶”声。在短短几秒之内，细弱的纤维纷纷掉落，根的中央部位紧紧地收缩在一起，随即开始枯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They both jogged toward the basement doors, hurrying out into the cold corridor and back toward the ladder that led upstairs. Chris was already going over escape plans for when they left the bunkhouse. It really would depend on where the exit led. If they ended up in the woods, he was thinking that they should head toward the closest road and light a fire, then wait for help to come… though maybe we'll get lucky, run across the damned parking lot for this place. We can hotwire a car and drive out -- and get Irons to do something useful for a change, like call in reinforcements.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个人小跑着奔向地下室的门，很快来到阴冷的走廊，回到了通往楼上的梯子处。克里斯已经在心里制定离开这里之后的计划了，实际上这完全要取决于出口通往什么地方。如果出去之后是森林的话，那么就找最近的道路，然后生一佳火等待救援人员发现自己…但是，也有可能最后出去的地方是这块私有领地的停车场。那样的话就先“借”辆汽车，然后让艾隆斯署长做一些新的部署，比如说请求援助之类的…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the elevator slid to a stop, Wesker opened the gates and stepped out, setting down the sample case. He unholstered his Beretta, going over the twisting layout of the power room in his mind. He had to make another run through the Ma2s to get to the activation system.
