<div class="line_en">One of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry's limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione's story, anyway -- Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.</div>

There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course.

<div class="line_en">"All this press attention seems to have inflated your already over-large head. Potter," said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你成了媒体关注的中心，这似乎使你本来就不小心的脑袋更加膨胀了，波特。”班上其他同学都安静焉为后，斯内普轻声说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So I give you fair warning, Potter," Snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice, "pint-sized celebrity or not -- if I catch you breaking into my office one more time --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因此，我要给你一个善意的警告，波特，”斯内普用更轻柔也更阴险的声音说，“尽管你小有名气——如果我再发现你闯进我的办公室——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn't hear what Snape was saying to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把粉末状的甲虫倒进坩埚，开始切割姜根。他气得双手微微发抖，但他始终低垂着眼睛，就好像根本听不见斯内普对他说的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you," Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), "but I don't care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me. Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你大概想当然地以为，整个魔法界都在为你惊叹，”斯内普继续说道，他的声音很轻，其他同学都听不见（哈利只管捣他的圣甲虫，尽管它们已经被碾成了细细的粉末），“但是我才不关心你的照片在报纸上出现多少次呢。在我眼里，波特，你不过是一个讨厌的小男孩，可你却觉得自己可以无视所有的规章制度。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry didn't answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn't stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year -- they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion -- and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利毫不示弱地瞪着斯内普，他坚决不眨眼睛，也不显出心虚的样子。说实话，他并没有从斯内普那里偷这两样东西。赫敏二年级的时候拿了非洲树蛇皮——他们需要用它来配制复方汤剂——当时斯内普怀疑到了哈利，但一直没有证据。那鳃囊草呢，不用说，是多比偷的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Snape's eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment. Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him -- then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯内普的眼睛闪了闪。他把一只手伸进他的黑袍子里面。一时间，哈利还以为斯内普要抽出魔杖，给他念咒呢——接着他看见斯内普掏出一只小小的水晶瓶，里面是一种清澈透明的药剂。哈利仔细地望着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Harry, with complete honesty this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道。”哈利说，这次他说的完全是实话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is Veritaserum -- a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear," said Snape viciously. "Now, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips' -- he shook the crystal bottle slightly -- "right over your evening pumpkin juice. And then. Potter… then we'll find out whether you've been in my office or not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是吐真剂——一种教你说实话的药剂，效果奇强，只要三滴，就能使你透露出内心深处的秘密，让全体同学洗耳恭听。”斯内普恶狠狠地说，“当然，对这种药剂的使用，魔法部有十分严格的规定加以控制。但是你必须格外留神，不然我就会失手，”——他微微摇晃着水晶瓶——“倒在你晚餐的南瓜汁里。然后，波特…然后我们就会弄清你究竟去没去过我的办公室了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn't like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it… quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble -- Hermione and Dobby for a start -- there were all the other things he was concealing… like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius… and -- his insides squirmed at the thought -- how he felt about Cho… He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody's book and start drinking only from a private hip flask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利没有说话。他又一次转向他的姜根，拿起小刀，又开始把它们切成碎片。他十分厌恶斯内普谈到的那种吐真剂，而且他认为斯内普很有可能偷偷给他洒上几滴。他设想，如果斯内普真的这么做了，自己嘴里不知会吐露些什么，一想到这点，他就忍不住打了个寒噤…他不仅会使许多人陷入麻烦——首先是赫敏和多比——更要命的是，他心里还藏着许多其他秘密呢…比如他一直在跟小天狼星保持联系…还有——他一想起来就觉得心里翻江倒海——他对秋的感情…他把姜根也倒进坩埚，一边暗想，不知是否应该学学穆迪的榜样，也在裤袋里挂一个弧形酒瓶，从此只喝那里面的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he'd poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.</div>

Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard.</div>

<div class="line_en">Karkaroff hovered behind Snape's desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class.

<div class="line_en">Harry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane.

It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius's wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry's bag cutting into his shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小天狼星领着他们一直来到山脚，这里的地面上布满大大小小的石头。他因为有四个爪子，走起来轻松自如，可是哈利、罗恩和赫敏很快就累得气喘吁吁了。他们跟着小天狼星越走越高，开始往山上爬。他们追随着小天狼星摇摆的尾巴，在蜿蜒、陡峭、怪石嶙峋的小径上攀登了将近半个小时，烈日烤得他们汗流浃背，哈利的书包带子勒得他肩膀生疼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak's fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch's principles might've been good in the beginning -- I wouldn't know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort's supporters. The Aurors were given new powers -- powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you -- plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened…" Sirius smiled grimly. "Crouch's own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who'd managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He wasn't the only one," said Sirius bitterly. "Most go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his son's body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“死的不止他一个，”小天狼星痛苦地说，“在那里，大多数人都发了疯，许多人最后都绝食了。他们丧失了生活下去的愿望。一个人什么时候死是可以知道的，因为摄魂怪能够感觉到，每到这时他们就兴奋不已。那个男孩来的时候就病歪歪的。克劳奇是魔法部的重要官员，他和他的妻子获准看望临终前的儿子。那是我最后一次看见巴蒂·克劳奇，他半搀半扶着妻子，从我的牢房前走过。看样子他妻子很快就死了。悲伤过度。像那个男孩一样憔悴而死了。克劳奇没有来领取儿子的尸体。摄魂怪把他埋在了要塞外面。我看着他们这么做的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made," he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. "One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic… next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I've heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因此，就在可怜的克劳奇以为大功告成的时候，他把一切都失去了。”他用手背擦擦嘴唇，继续说道，“刚才还是一个英雄，信心十足地要成为魔法部部长…转眼间，儿子死了，妻子也死了，家庭的名誉被玷污了，而且，我逃跑出来以后听说，他在公众心目中的威信急剧下降。男孩死去后，人们开始更多地同情儿子，并且提出疑问：为什么一个来自良好家庭的孩子会走上这样的邪路？得出的结论是他父亲从来不怎么关心他。就这样，康奈利·福吉坐上了第一把交椅，克劳奇被平调到了魔法部国际合作司。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was," Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other.

He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I'm not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he's seen, it's not surprising. I'll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though… he's a different matter… is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape's office? And if he's not… what's he up to?
