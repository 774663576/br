<div class="line_en">Kitty rang the bell at the house in Harrington Gardens. She was told that her father was in his study and going to the door she opened it softly: he was sitting by the fire reading the last edition of the evening paper. He looked up as she entered, put down the paper, and sprang nervously to his feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something in her father's tone that made her look at him quickly. His face was slightly turned from her; he did not want her to catch his eye. Kitty had acquired of late a singular proficiency at reading the thoughts of others. After all, day after day she had applied all her sensibilities to divine from a casual word or an unguarded gesture the hidden thoughts of her husband. She guessed at once what her father was trying to hide from her. It was relief he felt, an infinite relief, and he was frightened of himself. For hard on thirty years he had been a good and faithful husband, he had never uttered a single word in dispraise of his wife, and now he should grieve for her. He had always done the things that were expected of him. It would have been shocking to him by the flicker of an eyelid or by the smallest hint to betray that he did not feel what under the circumstances a bereaved husband should feel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她父亲的声调里有某种异样的东西，使她迅速地看了他一眼。他把脸略微地错开了，不愿意叫她瞧见他的眼睛。凯蒂早已习得了看透人心思的本事，毕竟她曾经天天都得从她丈夫的只言片语和举手投足中琢磨他脑子里藏着什么想法。她马上猜到她父亲是想掩饰什么——是一种解脱，一种发自内心的解脱，把他自己也吓了一跳。三十年来他一直充当着一位称职而忠诚的丈夫的角色，从未说过一句忤逆妻子的话，而现在，他无疑应当悲痛万分地哀悼她。他从来都是依顺人们对他的期望行事，而今他自己身上的细小举动表明，他此时的心境并非一个刚受丧妻之痛的鳏夫所应有的，他因而感到异常震惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Garstin lay on the bed, her hands folded across her breasts with a meekness which in life she would have had no patience with. With her strong sharp features, the cheeks hollow with suffering and the temples sunken, she looked handsome and even imposing. Death had robbed her face of its meanness and left only an impression of character. She might have been a Roman empress. It was strange to Kitty that of the dead persons she had seen this was the only one who in death seemed to preserve a look as though that clay had been once a habitation of the spirit. Grief she could not feel, for there had been too much bitterness between her mother and herself to leave in her heart any deep feeling of affection; and looking back on the girl she had been she knew that it was her mother who had made her what she was. But when she looked at that hard, domineering and ambitious woman who lay there so still and silent with all her petty aims frustrated by death, she was aware of a vague pathos. She had schemed and intrigued all her life and never had she desired anything but what was base and unworthy. Kitty wondered whether perhaps in some other sphere she looked upon her earthly course with consternation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾斯汀夫人静静地躺在床上，两只手温顺地交叠在胸前，要是在她活着的时候，绝不会允许自己做出这么矫揉造作的姿势。她的五官棱角分明，脸颊因为长久的病痛已经陷了下去，太阳穴陷成了一个窝儿。不过她看上去还是十分清秀，甚至有几分壮丽。死亡已经把尖酸刻薄从她的脸上抹去，只留下了富有人性的容貌。她看上去就像一位罗马皇后。这是凯蒂第一次看到一具能让人想起曾经有灵魂逗留的尸体。她没有感到悲哀，她们母女之间常常剑拔弩张，因而凯蒂的心里对母亲没有很深的感情。回忆自己的成长经历，她明白自己的一切都是母亲一手造成的。然而一个曾经叱咤风云、野心勃勃的女人，如今未竟夙愿却一声不吭地躺了下来，多少也让人感慨几分。一辈子工于算计、勾心斗角，而追求的却是那些低级、无聊的东西。凯蒂觉得她妈妈世俗的一生在某种程度上甚至使她感到惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went upstairs and into the large, cold and pretentious bedroom in which her mother for so many years had slept. She remembered so well those massive pieces of mahogany and the engravings after Marcus Stone which adorned the walls. The things on the dressing-table were arranged with the stiff precision which Mrs. Garstin had all her life insisted upon. The flowers looked out of place; Mrs. Garstin would have thought it silly, affected and unhealthy to have flowers in her bedroom. Their perfume did not cover that acrid, musty smell, as of freshly washed linen, which Kitty remembered as characteristic of her mother's room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她上了楼，走进了那个宽敞、阴冷的房间，这就是她妈妈睡了多年的自命不凡的卧房。她清晰地记得那些桃花心木的大号家具，记得墙上镶嵌的模仿马库斯·斯通的浮雕。梳妆台的布局和贾斯汀夫人生前的一贯要求丝毫不差。但是到处摆放的花束似乎与周围格格不入，贾斯汀夫人一定会认为在房间里摆放花束是愚蠢、做作，同时也不利于健康的。花香没有遮住那股如同新洗过的亚麻布的刺鼻霉味，凯蒂记得这种气味是她妈妈的房间里所独有的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你想去看看父亲吗？”当多丽丝暴风骤雨般的情绪有所减弱后，凯蒂问她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bursting into tears, she flung herself into Kitty's arms. Kitty kissed her. She knew how her mother had neglected Doris in favour of her and how harsh she had been with her because she was plain and dull. She wondered whether Doris really felt the extravagant grief she showed. But Doris had always been emotional. She wished she could cry: Doris would think her dreadfully hard. Kitty felt that she had been through too much to feign a distress she did not feel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多丽丝的泪水夺眶而出，她扑到凯蒂的怀里。凯蒂亲吻了她。她知道妈妈为了给她撑门面，让多丽丝做出了不少牺牲；与凯蒂相比，她是那么平庸乏味，这一定使她对凯蒂又忌又恨。凯蒂怀疑多丽丝心里是否有她表现出来的那么悲伤，不过她倒一直都是多愁善感的。凯蒂希望自己也能挤出几滴眼泪来，不然势必会让多丽丝觉得她这个人过于铁石心肠了。但是经过了这么多的事以后，她也懒得去惺惺作态、假意慈悲了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Doris wiped her eyes. Kitty noticed that her sister's pregnancy had blunted her features and in her black dress she looked gross and blousy.</div>
