<div class="line_en">When later that morning Lydia suggested walking to Meryton to see some of the officers, all her sisters except Mary agreed to accompany her. Even Mr Collins went with them, encouraged by Mr Bennet, who was by now most anxious to have some time to himself. During their walk, the girls listened politely to Mr Collins'self-important speeches, but as soon as they entered Meryton, the younger ones no longer eved pretended to be interested in his conversation, but looked eagerly around in search of the officers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then all the young ladies noticed a very gentleman-like young man, whom they had never seen before, walking down the street with an officer they knew. They were all wondering who the handsome stranger could be, when the officer came up to them to greet them. He asked permission to introduce his friend, whose name was Mr Wickham, and who had apparently arrived recently from London, to become an officer in the regiment. This was exactly as it should be, because the young man only needed an officer's uniform to become completely charming. He was very good-looking, with a very pleasant, sociable manner, and after the introductions, conversation flowed most enjoyably in the little group. They were still standing and talking happily together, when they heard the sound of horses, and saw Darcy and Bingley riding down the street. The two gentlemen came straight towards the ladies to greet them. Bingley was clearly most interested in Jane Bennet, and started talking particuarly to her. Darcy, however, was just determining not to look at Elizabeth, when he suddenly noticed the stranger. By chance Elizabeth saw Darcy's and Wickham's faces at the moment when they caught sight of each other, and she was astonished at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one white, the other red. After a few moments Mr Wickham touched his hat, and Mr Darcy nodded very slightly. What could this mean? It was impossible to imagine, and it was impossible not to wish to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时，所有的年轻小姐都注意到了一位风度翩翩的年轻人，这个人她们以前从未见过，现在正和一位她们认识的军官沿着大街往前走。她们正在纳闷这位英俊的陌生人是谁，那位军官走过来和她们打招呼。军官获得允许之后介绍了他的朋友韦翰先生。他显然是新近从伦敦过来的，调到团里当军官。看来军官就理应他当，因为这个年轻人只需配上军官制服，便能使姑娘们完全为之倾倒。此人一表人才，谈吐文雅，待人随和，互相介绍完毕之后，这个小团体就充满了欢声笑语。他们正站在一块愉快地交谈，这时他们听到一阵马蹄声，看见达西和彬格莱骑着马沿街走来。两位先生径直来到姑娘们面前与她们打招呼。彬格莱显然对简·班纳特最感兴趣，开始跟她一个人谈话。而达西正在下决心不去看伊丽莎白时，突然注意到了那位陌生人。达西和韦翰目光相撞时，伊丽莎白正好看到他们两人的脸色。她对两人相遇时的表现感到惊讶不已。两人脸色都变了，一个白，一个红。片刻之后，韦翰先生碰了碰帽子以示行礼，达西先生则轻微地点了点头。这会是什么意思？不可能想象得出来，而且也不可能不想去探个究竟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In another moment Mr Bingley, who did not seem to have noticed what had happened, said goodbye and rode away with Mr Darcy. The two officers accompanied the young ladies to Mrs Philips' house, but did not go in, in spite of Lydia's repeated invitations. Mrs Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and welcomed Mr Collins most politely when he was introduced to her. She did not, however, have any more information for the girls about the agreeable Mr Wickham.</div>

<div class="line_en">The girls were delighted and agreed at once to this arrangement, and the whole group walked back to Longbourn, happily discussing the enjoyable evening they were going to have. Mr Collins had been very impressed with Mrs Philips' politeness, and when they reached Longbourn, he complimented Mrs Bennet on her sister's elegance and charming manners.</div>

<div class="line_en">This remark did not at first please his hostess very much, but when she heard from him what Rosings was, and who its owner was, and how much Lady Latherine's furniture cost, she realized what a great compliment it was. During the evening Mr Collins found Mrs Philips a kind and attentive listener, which was fortunate, as the Bennet girls could not bring themselves to listen to him any longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话起初并没有使女主人感到十分高兴，可是，当她得知罗新斯是什么、它的主人是谁、凯瑟琳夫人的家具多么昂贵时，她才认识到刚才的话是何等的恭维。那天晚上，柯林斯先生发现菲力普斯太太很和蔼，听别人讲话很专心。这一点使他很幸运，因为班纳特家的姑娘们已经再也耐不住性子听他讲了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Mr Collins was shown into the sitting-room, and had time to look around and admire it, he said immediately to Mrs Philips, "Madam, I must compliment you on the size and furniture of this room Really, I could almost imagine myself in the smaller summer breakfast-room at Rosings!"</div>

<div class="line_en">All the ladies were impatient to see Mr Wickham, and when he came into the room, he appeared far more charming and gentlemanly than any of the officers present. He was the lucky man towards whom almost every female eye turned, and Elizabeth was the lucky woman beside whom he finally took his seat. His pleasant way of making conversation made her feel that he could talk interestingly about anything. As he did not play cards, which some of the party were doing, he stayed talking to Elizabeth for a large part of the evening. She hoped he would tell her how he knew Mr Darcy, but she dared not mention that gentleman. Luckily, however, Mr Wickham himself began to talk about it, although in a rather hesitating manner.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh no! I won't be driven away by Mr Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. The reason I have for avoiding him is one I could easily make public to the whole world -- he has treated me very badly. His late father, Miss Bennet, was one of the best men who ever lived, and the most faithful friend I ever had. And whenever I'm with this Mr Darcy, I think of his father with the most painful regret. Mr Darcy has behaved wickedly to wards me, but I could forgive him anything except the insult to his father's memory."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，不会的！我不会被达西先生赶走的。如果他想避免见到我，他应当走。我不想见他的理由我可以轻易地向全世界公开——他待我很糟糕。班纳特小姐，他已故的父亲是世界上最好的人之一，也是我所有朋友中最忠诚的。每当我和现在的达西先生在一起时，我一想到他的父亲，便会充满了最令人痛心的遗憾。达西先生对我十分恶毒，但是，我一切都可以原谅他，就是不能原谅他辱没了他先父的声名。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The world is blinded by his fortune and importance, or frightened by his proud behaviour, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen." After a pause Wickham added, "I wonder if he's likely to stay at Netherfield much longer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他得到这样的评价是罪有应得，我对此表示难过也不是装出来的。但对于他，人们一般不会作出你这样的评价。因为世人都被他的财产和地位蒙住了眼睛，或者被他的傲慢行为吓懵了，只能是他摆出什么样子，大家就看什么样子。”韦翰顿了一下，接着说，“我不知道他是否可能在尼日斐长期呆下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth was fascinated, and listened eagerly, but did not like to ask any questions. Mr Wickham began to speak more generally about Meryton and the charming people he had met there.</div>

I think he was jealous of his father's affection for me, which annoyed him from the beginning."</div>

She had never doubted he would come, and had dressed with more than her usual care, looking forward to winning his heart, which she knew was already partly hers. But she immediately suspected that Darcy had persuaded Bingley not to invite Wicham, and although she discovered from one of the officers that in fact Wickham had been invited, but had been called away on business, she felt sure Wickham had wanted to avoid meeting Darcy, and blamed Darcy for this. As a result, when Darcy greeted her, she was so annoyed with him that she could hardly reply politely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期二晚上，伊丽莎白走进了尼日斐的大厅，在穿着红色制服的军官中怎么也找不到韦翰先生。对他的缺席，伊丽莎白感到又奇怪，又失望。她从来没有想过他会不来，所以刻意打扮了一番，希望赢得他的欢心。她知道，他的心已有一部分属于她了。但是，她马上怀疑是达西说服了彬格莱不要邀请韦翰。尽管她从一位军官那里得知实际上韦翰受到了邀请，不过有公务而被抽走了，但她还是肯定，韦翰是想避免见到达西，因此又把罪责推到了达西身上。所以，当达西和她打招呼时，她对他很恼火，几乎不能有礼貌地回答他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was very surprised, and rather annoyed. She had hoped that Wickham would ask her for those dances, but now she would have Mr Collins instead! She could not refuse, however, and his request also worried her in another way. His manner to her seemed particularly flattering, which gave her the unwelcome idea that perhaps she had been chosen from among her sisters to be the rector of Hunsford's wife. As she observed the increasing number of compliments he paid to her beauty and character, she felt sure that he intended to propose marriage. For the moment, however, she decided to do nothing, but wait and see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很奇怪，还有点恼火。她希望韦翰请她跳前两场，可现在却要和柯林斯先生跳！可是，她不能拒绝，而且，他的请求使她感到担心的还有另外一点。他对她似乎特别殷勤，这给她一种不祥的感觉，即，在众姐妹中莫非是她被选中了做汉斯福教区长的妻子？她观察到他对她的美貌和性格奉承的次数越来越多，便肯定他想要求婚了。不过，目前她决定按兵不动，等着瞧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But she soon became more cheerful, and determined to enjoy the ball in spite of Wickham's absence. Unfortunately, the first two dances, with Mr Collins, were painfully embarrassing, as her cousin had no idea how to dance, and moved extremely awkwardly. She was relieved to leave him, and have the third dance with an officer, who gave her great pleasure by talking about Wickham and his popularity in the regiment. Alter this, she was very surprised to be approached by Mr Darcy and invited to dance. She was so astonished, in fact, that she accepted him without thinking, and found herself standing opposite him on the dance floor. "What an honour for me, to be allowed to dance with Mr Darcy!" she thought. They danced for some time in silence, and then she made a remark. He replied, and was silent again. After a pause, she spoke again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，不一会儿她就高兴起来了，并决心在韦翰缺场的情况下尽情享受这个舞会。遗憾的是，和柯林斯先生跳的前两场舞令人十分难堪，因为她的表兄根本不会跳舞，动作笨拙极了。跟他跳完以后，她松了口气。第三场是与一位军官跳的，这位军官谈到韦翰先生和他在团里的好人缘，使她获得很大乐趣。跳完之后，达西先生走近她并请她跳舞，她感到十分惊讶。实际上，她由于过分惊讶，来不及思考就接受了他的邀请，发现自己已经在舞池中站到了他的对面。“能获许同达西先生跳舞，这对我该是多大的荣幸呀！”她想。他们在沉默中跳了一会儿，伊丽莎白说了一句话，他回答完毕，又陷入了沉默。停顿了一下，她又开了口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He has been unlucky enough to lose your friendship," replied Elizabeth sharply, "and in a way which will cause him hardship all his life." Darcy did not reply to this, and there was only time for a little more conversation before the dance ended.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他真不走运，竟然失去了您的友谊，”伊丽莎白刻薄地说，“而且失去友谊的方式使他终生受罪。”达西没有回答，仅剩一点儿时间了，又谈了几句话，舞会就结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of the evening brought Elizabeth little amusement. She could not even go and talk to people she knew, as Mr Collins seemed determined to stay close by her side all evening. Fortunately, her good friend Charlotte Lucas occasionally gave her some relief, by kindly listening to some of Mr Collins' long speeches. At least Elizabeth did not have to talk to Mr Darcy any more. He often stood near her, quite alone, but did not come close enough to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上剩下的时间没给伊丽莎白带来多少乐趣。她甚至不能脱身去和熟人说话，因为柯林斯先生似乎下定了决心整个晚上都傍在她身边形影不离。幸运的是，她的好友夏洛特·卢卡斯偶尔让她松了口气，十分和善地听听柯林斯先生的某些长篇大论。伊丽莎白至少不用和达西先生说话了。他经常站在她附近，形单影只，但又不凑近了说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth went to find Jane, and listened with delight as she described her feelings for Bingley, and her confidence in his affection for her. But apart from Jane, it seemed to Elizabeth that if her family had made an agreement to appear as stupid as possible during the ball, they could not have been more successful. First Mr Collins insisted on going to introduce himself to Mr Darcy, the nephew of his respected patron, and was received very coldly. Then, during supper, Mrs Bennet could not be prevented from talking very loudly to Lady Lucas about her great hopes of Jane's marriage to Bingley. Elizabeth blushed in embarrassment when she realized that the Bingley sisters and Mr Darcy were able to hear. Finally, when some music was required, Mary Bennet went confidently to the piano, and sang and played several songs, all rather badly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊丽莎白走过去找到了简，兴高采烈地听她描述自己对彬格莱的感情，以及她如何坚信彬格莱对她也一往情深。但伊丽莎白似乎觉得，假如当初她们全家已达成一致，认为在舞会上出洋相越多越好的话，那么，他们这次表演是再成功不过的了，只有简是个例外。首先是柯林斯先生坚持要把自己介绍给达西先生，即他尊敬的保护人的外甥。而得到的反应却十分冷淡。接着是吃晚饭时班纳特太太禁不住大声地同卢卡斯夫人谈论她很有希望将简嫁给彬格莱。伊丽莎白意识到彬格莱姐妹和达西先生能听到这些话时，羞得两颊通红。最后是需要演奏音乐时，玛丽·班纳特走过去，充满自信地坐到钢琴前，演唱并弹奏了几首歌曲，都很糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the evening it was obvious to Elizabeth that although her family had greatly enjoyed the ball, the Bingley sisters were eager for these particular guests to leave. Mr Collins, however, was enthusiastic in his praise of the Bingleys' hospitality, and Mrs Bennet invited the whole Bingley family to visit Longbourn as soon as possible. She was feeling very satisfied, convinced that in three or four months Jane would be married to Bingley. She was also sure that Elizabeth would marry Mr Collins. This was a good enough marriage for Elizabeth, who was her least favourite daughter, but not nearly as impressive as Jane's marriage to Bingley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚会结束时，伊丽莎白明显地感觉到，虽然她全家在舞会上玩得都很高兴，但彬格莱姐妹希望他们这批客人赶快离开。然而，柯林斯先生还兴致勃勃地称赞彬格莱全家的盛情款待，班纳特太太又邀请彬格莱全家尽早到浪搏恩去。她感到十分满意，确信三四个月以后，简就可以和彬格莱成婚了。她也肯定伊丽莎白将会嫁给柯林斯先生。对伊丽莎白这位她最不待见的女儿来说，这样的结合已经够可以的了，但是根本比不上简和彬格莱的婚姻来劲。">查看中文翻译</div>
