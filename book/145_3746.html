<div class="line_en">As I began to explore new culinary regions of China beyond my old stamping grounds of Sichuan and Hunan, I found my thoughts drifting towards Fujian Province. Fujian lies on the south-eastern coast of China, sandwiched between Guangdong and the southern Yangtze region, and although it is now little known abroad, it was once at the forefront of Chinese international trade. In the Song Dynasty, Arab merchants sailed their galleys into the Fujianese ports of Quanzhou and Xiamen or Amoy, where they exchanged their cargoes of East Indian spices and luxury goods for Chinese porcelain and silk. Europeans traded at Xiamen from the sixteenth century until the mid-eighteenth. Later, the Chinese closed it to foreigners, but the British forced its re-opening as an international treaty port in 1842, after the first Opium War. As an entrepôt, Fujian has long exerted a steady, though rarely recognised, influence on the outside world: it is one of the most important sources of Chinese tea (the word 'tea' itself, and all its European variants, derive from Amoy dialect), and Fujianese immigrants, though less conspicuous than the Cantonese, are a powerful economic force in Western Chinatowns.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fujian, like most provinces, has its own style of cooking, which the Chinese call min cuisine. Xiamen and the Fujianese coast are known for their oyster pancakes and other seafood delicacies; the mountainous areas of the north for wild foods that include bamboo shoots, mushrooms and all kinds of creatures. Fine oolong teas, including Tie Guanyin or 'Iron Buddha', and 'Big Red Robe' (da hong pao), are produced in many parts of the province. Living in Hunan, I had acquired a taste for Fujianese teas, and I'd sampled min cooking in the new Fujianese cafes of London's Chinatown, but I was hungry for more. And so I arranged to visit the scenic area of Wuyishan in the north with some old Sichuan University classmates who were living in Shanghai, before travelling to southern Fujian on my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="福建和中国大多数省份一样，有自己独特的烹饪风格，也就是中国人所说的“闽菜”。厦门和其他沿海地区的蚝煎等海味美名在外，北部山区的竹笋、蘑菇等山珍野味也是惹人垂涎。省内很多地方还出产上好的乌龙茶，比如铁观音、大红袍。住在湖南的时候，我就爱上了福建的茶叶，也在伦敦唐人街新开的福建菜馆里稍稍领略过闽菜的风味。但我渴望更多的探索和体验。于是我计划了一下，先和目前定居上海的一些川大老同学去福建北部的武夷山风景区游玩一趟，再自己去南部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We had set off along the Nine-Bend River in blazing sunlight, on a bamboo raft, the soft plish-plash of the poles in the water lulling us into a stupor. The famous karst limestone peaks of Wuyishan loomed up on either side. 'We call that one the tortoise,' said our young guide, pointing to a low bank of rock rising out of the water, 'and that's the Great King's Peak.' He improvised too, for fun: 'Over there we have the han bao, the hamburger' (of a fat stack of slabs), 'and that's the Titanic' (of a mighty prow of rock, facing downriver).</div>

Briefly, we took shelter under a vast overhanging cliff, but it was nearly nightfall, and we had to press on. By the end we were all sodden, shivering. Our guide dropped us off in pitch darkness by the bank. We clambered up to the road, and flagged down a lift in a passing vehicle.</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening I was more in the mood for shepherd's pie than an extreme gastronomic experience, but it was my last night in northern Fujian and I felt I had to eat snake. Restaurant owner Mrs Liu had a few, coiled slinkily, in cages out the back, by the kitchen. Her husband stubbed out his cigarette and lifted the lid of one of the cages. A poisonous snake reared up angrily, hissing. He slammed the lid down again. When the snake had calmed down, he raised the lid more gently and grabbed it by the neck with a long pair of tongs. It lashed and writhed until he snipped off its head with a pair of scissors. He had two shot-glasses of strong rice vodka at the ready. The blood he shook into one of them, and then he pierced the ripped-out gall bladder and let it leak its greenish juices into the other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Liu's restaurant looked out over teabushes towards craggy mountains. In daylight the view was spectacular; at night it was a dark and peaceful place. The picture windows were unglazed, so you heard the loud hum of the insects as you ate, and felt that you were part of the landscape. Mrs Liu specialised in local ingredients, many of them wild. Her fridges were stocked with exotic fungi: finger-like 'dragon's claws', golden trumpets, grey 'thousand hands', slices of a large mushroom named locally after the Great King's Peak. Wildflowers with bright pink petals sat on the shelves alongside bamboo shoots and clawlike bulbs. There was another fridge too, for the meat. It contained some run-of-the-mill pork, but that wasn't really why people went to Mrs Liu's. The customers who frequented her establishment wanted the wild muntjac, wild rabbit, wild pheasant, wild turtle, snake…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刘太太很擅长利用当地食材，而且很多还是野生食材。她的冰箱里放满了奇异的菌菇：龙爪菇、金喇叭、灰色的千手菇、以当地的“大王峰”命名的巨大的大王菇，还有嫩粉色花瓣的野花和竹笋与爪子一样的姜笋摆在一起。另外还有个冰柜，专门用来放肉类，里面的猪肉品质一般。但大家来刘太太这里，可不是为了吃猪肉的。这家店的常客们想吃的是野麂子、野兔、野鸡、野甲鱼、蛇……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Drink them immediately,' he told me. So I put my lips to the rim of each glass in turn, and drank the traffic-light cocktails, the blood swirling scarlet in the first, the second bitter and invigorating. The strong liquor scorched my throat and brought tears to my eyes, while the sight of the raw swirling blood made me feel a little queasy. Then I watched Mrs Liu's husband slip off the snake's skin easily, like a piece of silk underwear, eviscerate and chop its carcass, and throw it into a pot of boiling water, with a handful of wolfberries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“马上喝。”他跟我说。于是我用嘴唇分别碰了每一个杯子的杯沿，把这两杯红绿灯一样的“鸡尾酒”给喝了：先是那杯血丝还在里面旋转翻滚的红酒，再是那杯苦涩到令人精神一振的绿酒。烈酒让我的喉咙火辣辣的，泪水泛在眼眶里，而生血的腥味又让我胃里翻江倒海。接着，我目睹刘太太的丈夫习以为常地剥了蛇皮，好像那是一条丝绸内裤。他把蛇的内脏清理干净，把尸体剁成小段，扔进一锅开水里，加了把枸杞。从刘太太的餐厅望出去，就是陡峭的山与连绵的茶树。白天风景壮阔美好，漆黑的晚上则是宁静悠然。观景窗都没有安玻璃，所以吃饭的时候能听到响亮的虫声，我觉得自己也融入了此情此景当中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As a foreigner who had made a decision, long before, to eat everything, I should have been in my element. But ethical dilemmas were creeping up on me, more and more. By now I knew that some species of muntjac were endangered. How was I to know whether the one on the table was among them? It was the same with almost everything in Mrs Liu's fridge, when I thought about it. I hoped that the snake whose blood and gall I'd just drunk was not a wild five-pace snake (the long-noded pit viper is known in Fujian as the wu bu she, because you'll drop dead after five paces if it bites you), but I was no expert on snake markings, and Mrs Liu was open about her sale of endangered species.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很久以前，我这个外国人就下定决心什么都要吃。这下算是来对地方了。但我心中悄然升起良心道德上的自我谴责，而且越来越强烈。我已经知道某些麂是濒危动物，那怎么知道桌上的盘中餐是不是其中一种呢？这么想想的话，刘太太冰箱里还有一些食材也是一样。希望那条刚刚被我喝下鲜血和胆汁的蛇不是那种野生的五步蛇（这是福建人对一种响尾蛇的俗称，因为传说要是被这种蛇咬了，你走五步就死了），但我也不是什么蛇类专家，看不出来。刘太太也相当坦白地谈自己卖濒危动物的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The kitchen was a simple affair, clean, white-tiled, with a sink and a couple of gas burners. The cooking was straightforward too, but the ingredients so fresh and fine that it all tasted magnificent. Our snake soup was refreshing, the flesh tender and savoury on its snagged, spiny nuggets of backbone. We ate sliced muntjac with fresh red chilli and onion, robust and gamey; wild mushrooms; pheasant red-braised with carrot and chilli; rabbit with sweet peppers, ginger and garlic; and a wild green known as 'ginseng vegetable'. Mrs Liu had run out of eggs, so when we ordered some egg-fried rice, she sent her son out into the live, twittering darkness to find a villager who kept hens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厨房布置简单，干净整洁，墙上镶了白瓷砖，有一个水池和两个煤气炉。烹饪方法也是简单直接，但因为食材新鲜上乘，所有的菜都是无上的美味。我们的蛇汤令人神清气爽，蛇肉软嫩，那粗糙的蛇骨啃起来也是回味无穷。我们吃了新鲜辣椒加洋葱做的麂子肉片，味道很强烈，充满了原始的野性；还有山里的新鲜蘑菇、胡萝卜红烧辣野鸡、甜椒姜蒜炒野兔以及一种绿色的野菜——“人参菜”。刘太太没有鸡蛋了，但我们又点了蛋炒饭，于是她就叫儿子走进四处虫鸣的黑夜中，找个养了母鸡的村民要了几个鸡蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>

Once she was caught red-handed with a fridgeful of illegal wild creatures, and the inspectors wanted to fine her 50,000 yuan. But she buttered them up by inviting them for dinner, and got away with paying just five thousand. 'Anyway,' she went on, 'local officials themselves eat endangered species. Of course they daren't do it publicly, in fancy city places, but in a quiet, out-of-the-way spot like this, it's okay. And there are different grades of protected animals. There are heavy, heavy penalties for killing Grade One State-Level Protected species, like the panda.' She mimed a knife slitting her throat. 'For Grade Twos, you're looking at six months in prison. But Grade Threes are sold openly on the market, like the muntjac you just had for dinner.' (A sharp pang of guilt.)</div>

Tourists were invited to buy whole cucumbers and steamed buns to feed them. The bears reared up on their hind legs to catch the food. This was not the kind of place where foreigners were normally welcome. The rearing of bears for their bile is a sensitive subject: the medicinal bile is drained from the gall bladders of live animals, and animal rights activists regard it as an abomination. I half-expected to have my way barred, or to be thrown out by an officious manager. But nobody stopped me, and the staff members who caught sight of me were shy with surprise.

<div class="line_en">There has always been an appetite in China for rare culinary exotica. Bear's paw was a courtly delicacy in the Warring States period; until then only emperors were allowed to touch it. One early Han Dynasty text refers to a primitive 'red-braised bear's paw', cooked with medicinal peony root and fermented sauce. And nearly two and a half millennia ago, the Confucian philosopher Mencius used it as an allegory for virtue in a disquisition on the inherent goodness of human nature:</div>

<div class="line_en">Bear's paw was only one in a pantheon of ancient delicacies that included owl, jackal and leopard foetus. Later, more modern exotica like shark's fin and bird's nest (the dried nests of swifts, made from their saliva, which are eaten in soup) attained the highest culinary status. The first written mention of bird's nest as an ingredient is in a Yuan Dynasty text; shark's fin was eaten widely from the Ming.

<div class="line_en">Although leopard's foetus appears to have gone out of fashion, many rare and exotic ingredients are still widely eaten by the rich and privileged in China, or they were until very recently. One cookery book in my collection, a compendium of state banquet recipes published in the mid-eighties, includes lavish colour plates of the famous delicacies served to national leaders and foreign dignitaries. And there, among the shark's fin, bird's nest and abalone, is a photograph of a hairy black bear's paw arranged on a ruched tablecloth, next to a dish bearing another, red-braised, paw, with an elaborate vegetable sculpture in the background.</div>

And this book was published in 2002! Fortunately, in a gesture to emerging environmental concerns, it offers readers the alternative of cooking deer lips in a similar sauce, and of using skin-on mutton squashed into a paw-shaped mould as a substitute for bear's paw.

<div class="line_en">Theoretically, much of the appeal of these rare delicacies lies in their tonic properties, and their luxurious mouthfeels. Shark's fin, for example, is rich in protein, contains some minerals, and is thought to combat arterioschlerosis; it is also prized for its strandy silkiness in the mouth, and its gelatinous bite. Bird's nest has a pleasantly slithery crunchiness and contains several minerals, as well as glycine: it is one of the most important yin tonics in Chinese medicine. The ovarian fat of forest frogs is a snow-white cloud of diaphanous slipperiness. Other banquet ingredients such as bear's paw and camel's hump, and presumably dried orangutan lips, subside, after a long, slow cooking, into smooth, soothing, rubbery waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理论上来说，这些珍稀食材的主要吸引力，都是其养生价值和奢侈口感。比如，鱼翅富含蛋白质，还有一些矿物质据说能缓解治疗动脉硬化，绸缎一般爽滑和咬下去那种凝胶状的脆嫩口感也为人追捧。燕窝也是吃进来滑滑的，咬下去脆脆的，令唇齿愉悦，其中也含有几种矿物质和甘氨酸，是中药中一味重要的阴补药材。雪蛤就像一团雪白透亮的云朵，吃着也很滑嫩。还有熊掌、驼峰以及传说中的猩唇这些盛宴食材，经过长时间的文火慢煮，入口应该都是绵密悠长、安慰口腹、萦绕于心的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The threat to sharks from the insatiable hunger of the Chinese market for their fins has received most international publicity, partly because of the practice of 'finning' (where fishermen reportedly slash the valuable fins off a live shark, and throw the rest of the fish back into the water, bleeding and disorientated). Shark's fin is de rigeur at Cantonese wedding banquets; half the global trade in sharks' fins is conducted in Hong Kong, where entire shops are devoted to them. The notorious traffic in fins is, however, just the tip of the iceberg, the fin of the fish. The Chinese are the world's most rapacious consumers of endangered species in general. Wild creatures from every corner of the planet fetch up in Chinese hotpots and medicinal brews.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国际上关注和曝光最多的，是中国市场对鱼翅的贪得无厌威胁到鲨鱼的生存。之所以关注度高，部分是因为取鱼翅的行为过于残忍（据说渔民会直接从活鲨鱼身上割下昂贵的鱼翅，再把它们扔回海里，任其鲜血直流、慌乱失措、自生自灭）。南粤的婚宴上流行用鱼翅招待客人，全球有半数的鱼翅贸易是在香港进行的，很多店专门做这个生意。然而，臭名昭著的鱼翅贸易只不过是冰山一角、“巨鲨一翅”。总体来说，中国是全世界最贪婪的濒危动物消费国，这个星球上每个角落的野生动物都能出现在中国的火锅与药膳里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Chinese authorities make sporadic attempts to crack down on the illegal trade in endangered animals. The SARS crisis of 2003 lent an urgency to their efforts, because the epidemic was thought to have been caused by the virus leaping from wild civet cats (a traditional tonic food) into the general population. But it is hard to change an age-old culture of exotic eating. The officials nominally in charge of the heralded crackdowns are often those who like to slurp snake soup and turtle stew on the sly. And as for the peasants -- well, if you were a Fujianese peasant living on 2000 yuan a year, struggling to pay for your children's education and your parents' healthcare, and you saw a five-pace snake curled innocently in the bracken, what would you do?</div>

It was stacked with wooden crates in which wild animals languished, most half-dead with dehydration in the tropical sun. There were 31 pangolins, 44 leatherback turtles, nearly 2720 lizards, 1130 Brazilian turtles, and 21 bears' paws wrapped in newspaper. All of them rare and threatened creatures, they were on their way from the jungles of Southeast Asia to the dinner tables of the Cantonese south.

Local people, living in their gracious but dilapidated courtyard houses, growing and processing oolong tea for a living, couldn't afford to dine there.

One night in northern Fujian, before we stumbled upon the delicious haven of Mrs Liu's, my Shanghai friends and I asked a taxi driver to help us find a restaurant serving local specialities. We imagined a Fujianese version of a Tuscan agriturismo, a tranquil farmhouse in a bamboo grove. Of course we should have known better.

<div class="line_en">The restaurant tried to spin out the illusion of farmhouse eating by making us give our order in a kitchen ante-room where fish and eels swam in tanks, 'wild' vegetables filled enormous fridges and bee larvae squirmed in the remains of their nest. But this was rustic catering on an industrial scale. After a desultory meal, we returned to our hotel, a mountain-villa complex that was a favourite among the ruling classes. That weekend it had been invaded by junketing officials who were pretending to hold a conference while savouring the pleasures of rural life. They wandered around drunkenly in the small hours, shirts untucked, shouting in the corridors, knocking randomly on the doors of our rooms. Dolled-up young women from the massage parlour in the grounds hurried to and fro, giggling.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had hoped to find more genuine rural simplicity in southern Fujian. My path took me through Xiamen, where I stayed for a few nights on the small island of Guliangyu, just off the coast, once the home of the foreign treaty port residents. It was still clustered with colonial buildings, and home to China's largest collection of pianos -- another legacy of its cosmopolitan history. My destination, however, was not coastal Fujian, where the snakeheads run their illegal immigration rackets, and the friendly people eat sea worms in aspic with mustard sauce, sharkballs stuffed with minced pork, and all manner of delicious seafood snacks. Instead I was headed for an area near the border with Guangdong Province where the Hakka people live. The Hakka, which roughly translates as 'settler households', are traditionally the wanderers among the Han Chinese. Centuries ago, they migrated south, in several stages, from their homelands in northern China, to avoid insurrection and war. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, many of them put down roots in the mountainous areas of Guangdong and Fujian, because others had already claimed the more fertile, low-lying lands. They became known for their preserved vegetables and robust peasant cooking. And there is one area of south-western Fujian that I had longed to visit for years, where the Hakka clans still dwell in their ancestral clanhouses.</div>

It's a magnificent, fairy-tale extravagance of courtyards and grey-tiled rooves, framed by mountains, overlooking the stream. Now, of course, most of the drafty halls are empty and unused; no incense burns in the ancestral shrine. But in recent years, this area has been discovered by tourists and foreign designers, attracted by its distinctive architecture, and the Lins have turned one wing of their mansion into a guesthouse. It's a simple place, with rudimentary plumbing, but I'm not sure I've ever stayed anywhere so enchanting.</div>

It was a slow, winding drive from the nearest county town, along a hilly road littered with the aftermath of landslides. My driver was mostly silent, but whenever he answered his mobile phone he shouted into it as if his voice might otherwise be drowned out by the silence of the night. Eventually we stopped, and when I left the car I could hear the sound of water tumbling over stones. We picked our way along a path by a river, and through a gateway on to a long terrace, and then he led me through a small doorway in a great wide wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lins' grand house lies at the heart of tu lou ('earth-building') country. For more than ten centuries, until as late as the 1960s, the Hakka who migrated here constructed fortified compounds to protect their extended families from rival clans and marauding gangs. Many of the buildings are roundhouses, a little reminiscent of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London. Their towering outer walls are windowless on the lower floors, punctuated only by a single, easily defended gateway. Inside, tiered galleries rise up around a courtyard, each one opening into a ring of rooms. On the ground floor are the kitchens, the wells, the chicken coops, and the ancestral shrines; on the first floor the granaries; and above them the bedrooms and living rooms. Some of the roundhouses are very small; others have room for dozens of families. Similar clan-houses are built around square or rectangular courtyards, like the Lins'. In times of conflict, the Hakka could simply barricade their gates, and hold out for months with their fresh water and eggs, their stores of grain, tea, and preserves.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day after my arrival, I rose early, took breakfast in the courtyard, and then wandered out into the village. It was harvest time. Along the riverbanks, old women were peeling persimmons and laying them out to dry on bamboo trays. Fresh, they were fleshy and orange; after a few days they darkened and became toffee-sweet. Hisbiscus flowers also lay in the sun, shrivelled and purple, like witches' hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">I spent the next few days exploring the clan-houses, first on foot, and then, in the surrounding valleys, by motorbike. Some had been spruced up for the new tourist trade; the majority were falling into dereliction. Like most parts of rural China, the society of the tu lou region had been hollowed out by the effects of economic reform. Almost all the young adults had migrated to the cities to work, leaving behind only the elderly and children. Courtyards that had once echoed to the sound of a dozen sizzling woks were desolate. Chickens pecked around the discarded agricultural tools and cooking pots on the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">On my last evening in the village, I had dinner in the Lins' courtyard, with the other two guests, a Eurasian photographer and his British-Chinese girlfriend, both visiting from Hong Kong. We chose from a printed list of Hakka specialities that the Lins had produced for their foreign visitors. They made us a soup from a whole duck simmered with tea-tree mushrooms, and stir-fried chicken with shiitake mushrooms; there was stir-fried musk-melon, and 'blood vegetable', a wild local green. The fowl were inconceivably delicious, as real farmyard birds usually are. And then we had that most famous Hakka dish, steamed belly pork with preserved mustard greens. There was far more than we could possibly eat. The elder Lin brought us a jug of a Hakka home-brew made from glutinous rice, warm and heady like cider. We lingered in the courtyard, mellow with wine, as the candles burned down.</div>

They had resurrected their family shrine, retrieving the wooden statues of their ancestors from their Cultural Revolution hidey-hole. Their clothes were worn and they looked at me eagerly, hoping for a tip.
