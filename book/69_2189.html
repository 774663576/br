<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, around the edges of the fen country, the police were knocking at doors, searching attics and outhouses, inspecting papers and interrogating everyone who claimed to have seen a blond little girl; and in Oxford the search was even fiercer. Jordan College was scoured from the dustiest boxroom to the darkest cellar, and so were Gabriel and St. Michael's, till the heads of all the colleges issued a joint protest asserting their ancient rights. The only notion Lyra had of the search for her was the incessant drone of the gas engines of airships crisscrossing the skies. They weren't visible, because the clouds were low and by statute airships had to keep a certain height above fen country, but who knew what cunning spy devices they might carry?

<div class="line_en">"Swords? Great God, girl, you dreaming?" Ma Costa said. "Mr. Coulter had a gun, and Lord Asriel knocked it out his hand and struck him down with one blow. Then there was two shots. I wonder you don't remember; you ought to, little as you were. The first shot was Edward Coulter, who reached his gun and fired, and the second was Lord Asriel, who tore it out his grasp a second time and turned it on him. Shot him right between the eyes and dashed his brains out. Then he says cool as paint, 'Come out, Mrs. Costa, and bring the baby,' because you were setting up such a howl, you and that daemon both; and he took you up and dandled you and sat you on his shoulders, walking up and down in high good humor with the dead man at his feet, and called for wine and bade me swab the floor."</div>

<div class="line_en">And whenever she was alone, Lyra took out the alethiome-ter and pored over it like a lover with a picture of the beloved. So each image had several meanings, did it? Why shouldn't she work them out? Wasn't she Lord Asriel's daughter?</div>

<div class="line_en">Remembering what Farder Coram had said, she tried to focus her mind on three symbols taken at random, and clicked the hands round to point at them, and found that if she held the alethiometer just so in her palms and gazed at it in a particular lazy way, as she thought of it, the long needle would begin to move more purposefully. Instead of its wayward divagations around the dial it swung smoothly from one picture to another. Sometimes it would pause at three, sometimes two, sometimes five or more, and although she understood nothing of it, she gained a deep calm enjoyment from it, unlike anything she'd known. Pantalaimon would crouch over the dial, sometimes as a cat, sometimes as a mouse, swinging his head round after the needle; and once or twice the two of them shared a glimpse of meaning that felt as if a shaft of sunlight had struck through clouds to light up a majestic line of great hills in the distance -- something far beyond, and never suspected. And Lyra thrilled at those times with the same deep thrill she'd felt all her life on hearing the word North.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她记住了法德尔·科拉姆的话，努力把精力集中到随便选中的三个符号上，然后让指针嘀嘀嗒嗒地走，去指向这三个图片。她发现，如果把真理仪就这么放在手掌里，极其懒散地盯着它看，当她脑子里想着它的时候，那个长指针的移动就会显得更有目的性，不再沿着表盘毫无规律地乱走，而是从一个图片平稳地摆向另一个图片。有时，它会在三个图片那儿暂停一下，有时是两个图片，有时是五个或更多，尽管莱拉还没弄懂这是什么意思，但却从中得到一种深深的、平静的快乐，这跟她以前所经历过的全都不一样。潘特莱蒙会蜷伏在表盘上，有时变成猫，有时又变成老鼠，脑袋跟着那根指针摆来摆去；有一两次，他们俩都窥见了什么，觉得好像有一束阳光穿透云层、照亮远方巨大丘陵那壮丽的轮廓——那么遥远，她从来没有想到过。这时，莱拉便觉得全身颤栗起来——以前，听到北方这个词的时候，她也曾有过同样剧烈的颤栗。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Costas were part of the Stefanski family, and naturally Tony had been one of the first to volunteer.

<div class="line_en">"Nothing will hold my hand, Margaret, save only judgment. If I stay my hand in the North, it will only be to strike the harder in the South. To strike a day too soon is as bad as striking a hundred miles off. To be sure, there's a warm passion behind what you say. But if you give in to that passion, friends, you're a doing what I always warned you agin: you're a placing the satisfaction of your own feelings above the work you have to do. Our work here is first rescue, then punishment. It en't gratification for upset feelings. Our feelings don't matter. If we rescue the kids but we can't punish the Gobblers, we've done the main task.
