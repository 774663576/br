<div class="line_en">His brother came sliding through the trees, moving almost as quiet as another brother he remembered dimly from long ago, the white one with the eyes of blood. This brother's eyes were pools of shadow, but the fur on the back of his neck was bristling. He had heard the sounds as well, and known they meant danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弟弟从树丛中钻出来，动作沉寂得让他模糊想起很久之前有过的另一个兄弟，那个一身白毛却血红眼睛的哥哥。弟弟的眼睛如一泓阴影之池，后颈的毛全竖起来。他也听见了声音，知道意味着危险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sound was the faintest of clinks, a scraping of steel over stone. He lifted his head from his paws, listening, sniffing at the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">The evening's rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and strong again. Grass and thorns, blackberries broken on the ground, mud, worms, rotting leaves, a rat creeping through the bush. He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother's coat and the sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he'd killed. Other squirrels moved through the branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, their little claws scratching at the bark. The noise had sounded something like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜雨唤起千百种沉睡的味道，使它们成熟鲜活。青草和荆棘，地上的黑莓，泥土，蠕虫，腐叶，钻过灌木丛的老鼠…一切都清晰可辨。他还捕捉到弟弟那身茸茸黑毛的气味，以及他刚猎杀的松鼠所散发的浓烈血腥。很多松鼠在头顶枝头流窜，用小爪子抠挖树皮，湿润的毛皮，无边的恐惧。一如外面的噪声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he heard it again, clink and scrape. It brought him to his feet. His ears pricked and his tail rose. He howled, a long deep shivery cry, a howl to wake the sleepers, but the piles of man-rock were dark and dead. A still wet night, a night to drive men into their holes. The rain had stopped, but the men still hid from the damp, huddled by the fires in their caves of piled stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="声音又来了，刮动，碰击。他站起来，竖起耳朵，尾巴翘立，放声长嗥。那是一声绵长高亢毛骨悚然的嗥叫，他要唤醒沉睡的人们，然而附近人类的石山依旧黑暗死寂。这是个沉静而潮湿的夜，如此的夜将人类赶进了他们的洞窟。雨已停歇，但他们不想出来，而是躲在阴湿的石山灰洞，蜷缩在火堆边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This time the clink and scrape were followed by a slithering and the soft swift patter of skinfeet on stone. The wind brought the faintest whiff of a man-smell he did not know. Stranger. Danger. Death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刮动和碰击声再次传来，其间还夹杂着滑行的响动，柔软的皮脚在石面上迅捷地拍打。微风把一丝若有若无的男性气息吹到鼻尖。他不认得这气味。陌生。危险。死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He ran toward the sound, his brother racing beside him. The stone dens rose before them, walls slick and wet. He bared his teeth, but the man-rock took no notice. A gate loomed up, a black iron snake coiled tight about bar and post. When he crashed against it, the gate shuddered and the snake clanked and slithered and held. Through the bars he could look down the long stone burrow that ran between the walls to the stony field beyond, but there was no way through. He could force his muzzle between the bars, but no more. Many a time his brother had tried to crack the black bones of the gate between his teeth, but they would not break. They had tried to dig under, but there were great flat stones beneath, half-covered by earth and blown leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他朝声音源头猛扑过去，弟弟紧跟在旁。石山在眼前浮现，又滑又湿。他咧牙露齿，但人类的岩石并不理会。面前是一座门，黑柱条间紧紧盘绕着一条钢蛇。他撞上去，大门颤抖，钢蛇响动，它们摇晃半晌，复归平静。透过门上的缝隙，他看见岩壁之间长长的石头洞穴，直通向远方的石头广场，却过不去。他努力想钻过缝隙，办不到。弟弟用牙狠狠撕咬大门的黑骨头，咬不开。他们试图合力在底下挖洞，但地面是又平又大的石头，惟有表面被泥土和棕叶覆盖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Snarling, he paced back and forth in front of the gate, then threw himself at it once more. It moved a little and slammed him back. Locked, something whispered. Chained. The voice he did not hear, the scent without a smell. The other ways were closed as well. Where doors opened in the walls of man-rock, the wood was thick and strong. There was no way out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他咆哮着，在大门前奔来奔去，接着再次撞门。它移动半分，又把他“砰”地摔回来。门锁住了，有个声音在低语，被铁链锁住了。他听不出声音从哪里来，更闻不到气味。各个方向都走不通。人造绝壁上的每扇门都关闭，木头又厚又硬。无路可出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Through the gloom of night came a muffled shout, cut short.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声嘎然而止的闷哼，穿过夜色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is, the whisper came, and it seemed as if he could see the shadow of a great tree covered in needles, slanting up out of the black earth to ten times the height of a man. Yet when he looked about, it was not there. The other side of the godswood, the sentinel, hurry, hurry…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一条路，那声音又来了，突然之间，一棵罩着针叶的大树轮廓在眼前浮现，它从黑色的大地中斜斜地长出来，几乎有十个人高。可他抬头四望，什么也没有！它在神木林的另一边，是棵哨兵树，快啊，快啊…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Swiftly, swiftly, he whirled and bounded back into the trees, wet leaves rustling beneath his paws, branches whipping at him as he rushed past. He could hear his brother following close. They plunged under the heart tree and around the cold pool, through the blackberry bushes, under a tangle of oaks and ash and hawthorn scrub, to the far side of the wood… and there it was, the shadow he'd glimpsed without seeing, the slanting tree pointing at the rooftops. Sentinel, came the thought. He remembered how it was to climb it then. The needles everywhere, scratching at his bare face and falling down the back of his neck, the sticky sap on his hands, the sharp piney smell of it. It was an easy tree for a boy to climb, leaning as it did, crooked, the branches so close together they almost made a ladder, slanting right up to the roof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快，快，他急转身子，蹿进林中，湿叶在爪下沙沙作响，头顶紧密的枝条不住抽打。快，快。他听出弟弟紧跟在后。他们一同从心树下跑过，绕开泉水，穿越黑莓丛，经过杂乱的橡树、芩树和山楂林，朝树林远端前进…就是那里，就是那棵他从未留意却又历历在目的树，这棵歪斜的树顶部靠上屋檐。就是它，这想法突如其来。他还记得爬树的感觉。针叶无处不在，刮着脸庞，掉进后颈，黏稠的树液会沾上手掌，发出浓烈刺鼻的味道。爬这样的树对小男孩而言很容易，它又斜又弯，枝条密密匝匝好似一座天然的云梯，正好搭上屋顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Growling, he sniffed around the base of the tree, lifted a leg and marked it with a stream of urine. A low branch brushed his face, and he snapped at it, twisting and pulling until the wood cracked and tore. His mouth was full of needles and the bitter taste of the sap. He shook his head and snarled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怒吼几声，绕着大树底部边走边嗅，抬起一条腿撒尿作标记。低垂的枝干扫过脸庞，他反口咬住，扭啊拉啊，直到木头断裂。嘴里满是针叶和树液的苦昧，他甩甩头，放声嗥叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His brother sat back on his haunches and lifted his voice in a ululating howl, his song black with mourning. The way was no way. They were not squirrels, nor the cubs of men, they could not wriggle up the trunks of trees, clinging with soft pink paws and clumsy feet. They were runners, hunters, prowlers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弟弟靠着他的腰坐下，提起声音，陪他哀鸣，阴沉的声调里充满悲伤。此路不通。他们不是松鼠，也不像淘气的人类，他们柔软粉红的爪子和笨拙的腿脚没可能攀上枝条，登上大树的主干。他们是奔跑健将，是巡游者，是猎人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Off across the night, beyond the stone that hemmed them close, the dogs woke and began to bark. One and then another and then all of them, a great clamor. They smelled it too; the scent of foes and fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿过朦胧的黑夜，在包围他们的巨石之外，狗们苏醒过来，一只接一只地开始吠叫，声音越来越大，最后成为合声，发出巨大的喧嚷。他们也闻到了：敌人的气息，恐惧的滋味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A desperate fury filled him, hot as hunger. He sprang away from the wall loped off beneath the trees, the shadows of branch and leaf dappling his grey fur… and then he turned and raced back in a rush. His feet flew kicking up wet leaves and pine needles, and for a little time he was a hunter and an antlered stag was fleeing before him and he could see it, smell it, and he ran full out in pursuit. The smell of fear made his heart thunder and slaver ran from his jaws, and he reached the falling tree in stride and threw himself up the trunk, claws scrabbling at the bark for purchase. Upward he bounded, up, two bounds, three, hardly slowing, until he was among the lower limbs. Branches tangled his feet and whipped at his eyes, grey-green needles scattered as he shouldered through them, snapping. He had to slow. Something snagged at his foot and he wrenched it free, snarling. The trunk narrowed under him, the slope steeper, almost straight up, and wet. The bark tore like skin when he tried to claw at it. He was a third of the way up, halfway, more, the roof was almost within reach… and then he put down a foot and felt it slip off the curve of wet wood, and suddenly he was sliding, stumbling. He yowled in fear and fury, falling, falling, and twisted around while the ground rushed up to break him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="绝望挑起暴怒，紧紧攫住了他，同饥饿的感觉一般狂热。他离开墙壁，朝树林踱去，枝干和树叶在灰色的毛皮上留下斑斑驳驳的暗影…这时他猛然回头，急速冲刺，腿掌踢起湿叶和松针，刹那间他又成了猎人，而前方是一只亡命逃窜的长角雄鹿，他看得见，闻得到，他要尽全力冲刺扑杀。恐惧的气息使他心跳加速，惹起嘴角流淌的唾液。他大步跨越落木，飞上树干，爪子抠进树皮，接着向上跳跃，向上，向上，两次，三次，缓慢而艰辛，直到终于登上底部的分支。枝条纠缠着脚，鞭打他的眼睛，他挤过灰绿的针叶，身边一片劈啪声响。越走越慢。什么东西缠住了脚，他奋力扭开，大声咆哮。树干越来越窄，越来越陡，几乎成了直立，而且潮湿滑溜，当他用力抠抓，树皮像兽皮一般裂开。终于，他走了三分之一，一半，快了，屋檐几乎伸腿可及…这时他前脚踩空，脚掌在潮湿圆滑的树面滑过，顷刻之间，他身子一斜，绊下树去。在恐惧和愤怒中，他大声号叫，坠落，坠落，他蜷成一团，大地急速上袭，要把他撞个粉碎…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest had left eight days past, six hundred men from Winterfell and the nearest holdfasts. Cley Cerwyn was bringing three hundred more to join them on the march, and Maester Luwin had sent ravens before them, summoning levies from White Harbor and the barrowlands and even the deep places inside the wolfswood. Torrhen's Square was under attack by some monstrous war chief named Dagmer Cleftjaw. Old Nan said he couldn't be killed, that once a foe had cut his head in two with an axe, but Dagmer was so fierce he'd just pushed the two halves back together and held them until they healed up. Could Dagmer have won? Torrhen's Square was many days from Winterfell, yet still…</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Bran was back abed in his lonely tower room, tangled in his blankets, his breath coming hard. "Summer," he cried aloud. "Summer." His shoulder seemed to ache, as if he had fallen on it, but he knew it was only the ghost of what the wolf was feeling. Jojen told it true. I am a beastling. Outside he could hear the faint barking of dogs. The sea has come. It's flowing over the walls, just as Jojen saw Bran grabbed the bar overhead and pulled himself up, shouting for help. No one came, and after a moment he remembered that no one would. They had taken the guard off his door. Ser Rodrik had needed every man of fighting age he could lay his hands on, so Winterfell had been left with only a token garrison.</div>

<div class="line_en">But when the door crashed open behind him, the man who stepped through was no one Bran knew.

<div class="line_en">Bran pulled himself from the bed, moving bar to bar until he reached the windows. His fingers fumbled a little as he swung back the shutters. The yard was empty, and all the windows he could see were black. Winterfell slept. "Hodor!" he shouted down, as loud as he could. Hodor would be asleep above the stables, but maybe if he yelled loud enough he'd hear, or somebody would. "Hodor, come fast! Osha! Meera, Jojen, anyone!" Bran cupped his hands around his mouth. "HOOOOODOOOOOR!"</div>

A few torches had been lit, and a fire kindled in the great hearth, but most of the hall remained in darkness.
