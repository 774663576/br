<div class="line_en">Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom…</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利、罗恩、金妮和洛哈特站在门口，身上布满了淤泥和黏液，哈利的长袍上还沾着血迹。一时间，四下里一片静默。突然，一声尖叫——“金妮！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest.

<div class="line_en">So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle's diary -- or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley's shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle's diary didn't work anymore… How could they prove it had been he who'd made her do it all? Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是哈利继续往下说，他因为不停地讲话，嗓子都沙哑了。他告诉他们，福克斯怎样及时赶到，分院帽怎样赠给他宝剑。可是接着，他的声音变得迟疑了。他前面一直避免提到里德尔的日记——提到金妮。此刻，金妮正站在那里，把头靠在韦斯莱夫人的肩膀上，眼泪仍然默默地顺着她的面颊滚落下来。如果他们把她开除了怎么办呢？哈利紧张地思索着。里德尔的日记已经失灵了…他们怎么能够证明，那些事情都是里德尔强迫她做的呢？哈利本能地把目光投向了邓布利多，只见校长淡淡地微笑着，火光在他半月形的眼镜片上飞快地一闪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What interests me most," said Dumbledore gently, "is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school… traveled far and wide… sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away," Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. "This has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort." He strode over to the door and opened it. "Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up," he added, twinkling kindly down at her. "You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice -- I daresay the basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“韦斯莱小姐应该立刻到校医院去，”邓布利多不由分说地插嘴道，“这对她来说是一场痛苦的折磨。学校不会对她有什么惩罚的。许多比她年长、比她足智多谋的巫师都被伏地魔蒙蔽了。”他大步走到门边，把门打开。“卧床休息，或许，还应该再喝上一大杯热气腾腾的巧克力奶，我一向觉得那对改善我的心情很有好处。”他说，一边低头慈祥地冲金妮眨眨眼睛。“你会发现庞弗雷夫人还没有睡觉。她刚才在分发曼德拉草药水——我敢说，蛇怪的受害者随时都可能醒过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain. Why didn't you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“金妮！”韦斯莱先生惊得目瞪口呆，说道，“我难道没有教过你吗？我一直怎么跟你说的？永远不要相信任何能够独立思考的东西，除非你看清了它把头脑藏在什么地方。你当初为什么不把日记拿给我或你妈妈看看？像那样一个可疑的东西，显然充满了黑魔法的妖术！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences -- Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled ("but we've had plenty of practice at that anyway," Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏季学期剩下来的那段日子，是在一片耀眼的阳光中度过的。霍格沃茨恢复了正常，只有几个小小的变化：黑魔法防御术的课程取消了（“反正我们在这方面已经有了大量的实践。”罗恩对闷闷不乐的赫敏说），卢修斯马尔福被开除出了学校董事会。德拉科再也不在学校里趾高气扬地到处走来走去，就好像他是这里的主人似的。相反，他现在整天阴沉着脸，似乎心里充满了怨恨。另一方面，金妮韦斯莱又恢复了活泼开朗的性格。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George's Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一转眼，他们就要乘坐霍格沃茨特快列车回家了。哈利、罗恩、赫敏、弗雷德、乔治和金妮单独占了一个隔间，他们充分利用放假前允许使用魔法的最后几个小时。他们玩了“噼啪爆炸”，燃放了弗雷德和乔治的最后几支费力拔烟火，还互相练习了用魔法解除对方的武器。这一套魔法，哈利现在做起来已经很熟练了。">查看中文翻译</div>
