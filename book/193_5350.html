<div class="line_en">Turning now to the mountainous core of Bernini's fountain, Langdon summoned hope and launched himself into his quest for the final Illuminati marker. He knew somewhere on this gnarled mass of figures was a clue that pointed to the lair. As Langdon scanned the fountain, though, his hope withered quickly. The words of thesegno seemed to gurgle mockingly all around him. Let angels guide you on your lofty quest. Langdon glared at the carved forms before him. The fountain is pagan! It has no damn angels anywhere!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登现在转向贝尼尼喷泉中央起伏的小山，鼓起希望，开始寻找最后一个光明会指标。他知道在这一大群雕像中隐藏了一个线索，指向那个祕密基地。然而兰登扫视著喷泉，满腹希望却迅速消退了。「指示牌」的诗句似乎化为周围的汩汩水声在嘲弄他。崇高追寻路，天使引向前。兰登瞪著眼前的众多雕像。这是个异教喷泉！根本没有什麽该死的天使！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Langdon completed his fruitless search of the core, his eyes instinctively climbed the towering stone pillar. Four markers, he thought, spread across Rome in a giant cross.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喷泉中央的搜索徒劳无功之后，兰登的双眼出自直觉地沿著那座高耸的石柱往上。四个指标，他心想，成十字形分布在罗马城各处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fog of weary emotion lifted slowly as Langdon waded away from the dead cardinal, back into deep water. Depleted and alone in the fountain, Langdon half-expected to collapse. But instead, he felt a new compulsion rising within him. Undeniable. Frantic. He sensed his muscles hardening with an unexpected grit. His mind, as though ignoring the pain in his heart, forced aside the past and brought into focus the single, desperate task ahead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登涉水离开死去的枢机主教，回到深水处，一股倦意在体内缓缓扩散。孤单又力竭地站在喷泉裡，兰登半期望著自己晕倒算了。但相反地，他感觉到体内涌起一种难以抗拒的驱动力，坚定无疑又狂热。随著这股忽然生出的勇气，他感觉到全身肌肉变得强而有力。他的脑子好像无视于心头的痛，把过去撇到一旁，专注于眼前唯一的、最危急的任务。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Feeling a shimmer of hope, Langdon circumnavigated the fountain one more time and studied all four fa? ades of the obelisk. It took him two minutes, and when he reached the end of the final face, his hopes sank. Nothing in the hieroglyphs stood out as any kind of addition. Certainly no angels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登感到一丝希望，又绕著喷泉走了一圈，仔细检查方尖碑的四个面。他花了两分钟，来到最后一面时，希望落空了。那些象形文字中看不出有任何附加的符号，也当然不会有天使。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Scanning the hieroglyphics covering the obelisk, he wondered if perhaps there were a clue hidden in the Egyptian symbology. He immediately dismissed the idea. The hieroglyphs predated Bernini by centuries, and hieroglyphs had not even been decipherable until the Rosetta Stone was discovered. Still, Langdon ventured, maybe Bernini had carved an additional symbol? One that would go unnoticed among all the hieroglyphs?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他浏览著方尖碑表面上的埃及古象形文，心想说不定有个线索藏在那些埃及的象徵符号中，但又立刻抛开这个想法。那些象形文字比贝尼尼要早几千年出现，而且在罗塞塔石（Rosetta Stone）被发现前，埃及古象形文字根本尚未限免。不过兰登大胆假设，也许贝尼尼在上头另外刻了符号？藏在这些象形文字中就不会被注意到？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon checked his watch. It was eleven on the dot. He couldn't tell whether time was flying or crawling. Images of Vittoria and the Hassassin started to swirl hauntingly as Langdon clambered his way around the fountain, the frustration mounting as he frantically completed yet another fruitless circle. Beaten and exhausted, Langdon felt ready to collapse. He threw back his head to scream into the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登看看表，现在是十一点整。他分不清时间是过得太快还太慢。兰登攀爬著绕行喷泉时，薇多利雅和哈撒辛的影像开始萦绕不去，他狂乱地又绕完一圈，还是没结果，心中愈来愈失望。疲倦又挫折之馀，兰登觉得自己快垮下去了。他头往后一抬，想对著夜空大吼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon was staring straight up the obelisk. The object perched at the very top was one he had seen earlier and ignored. Now, however, it stopped him short. It was not an angel. Far from it. In fact, he had not even perceived it aspart of Bernini's fountain. He thought it was a living creature, another one of the city's scavengers perched on a lofty tower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登正直直往上瞪著方尖碑。停栖在碑顶的那个目标，他稍早见过但没留意。但现在，却忽然引起了他的注意。那不是天使，差得远了。事实上，他之前根本没察觉那是贝尼尼所设计的喷泉的一部份。他以为那是动物，不过是一隻栖息在高耸塔顶的罗马城垃圾食客。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon squinted skyward at the object, his vision blurred by the glowing mist around him. It was a pigeon, wasn't it? He could clearly see the head and beak silhouetted against a cluster of stars. And yet the bird had not budged since Langdon's arrival, even with the battle below. The bird sat now exactly as it had been when Langdon entered the square. It was perched high atop the obelisk, gazing calmly westward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登眯起眼睛朝天空看著那个目标，视线在发亮的水雾中模糊了。那是鸽子，对不对？衬著夜空的繁星，他可以看见头和鸟喙的剪影。但从兰登进入广场到现在，那隻鸽子完全没动过，连底下发生过那场激烈的打斗都没影响。那隻鸟仍保持兰登初见时的那个姿势，高踞在方尖碑最顶端，冷静地朝西方凝视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A pigeon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸽子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon stared at it a moment and then plunged his hand into the fountain and grabbed a fistful of coins. He hurled the coins skyward. They clattered across the upper levels of the granite obelisk. The bird did not budge. He tried again. This time, one of the coins hit the mark. A faint sound of metal on metal clanged across the square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登瞪著那隻鸽子一会儿，然后手探入喷泉内，抓了一把硬币，朝天空掷去。硬币哗啦啦掠过花岗岩方尖碑的上半部，那隻鸟还是一动也不动。兰登再试一次，这回有一枚硬币击中那个指标，一个模糊的金属互撞铿锵声迴盪在广场上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You're looking for an angel, not a pigeon, a voice reminded him. But it was too late. Langdon had made the connection. He realized the bird was not a pigeon at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你要找的是天使，不是鸽子，一个声音提醒他。但来不及了，兰登已经联想起来了。他明白那隻鸟根本不是普通鸽子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a dove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是和平鸽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The truth almost lifted Langdon the rest of the way to the obelisk. Bernini had chosen thepagan symbol for the angel so he could disguise it in a pagan fountain. Let angels guide you on your lofty quest. The dove is the angel! Langdon could think of no more lofty perch for the Illuminati's final marker than atop this obelisk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个事实几乎鼓舞兰登一路攀登到方尖碑。贝尼尼选择了这个异教的天使符号，才能使之隐藏在异教的喷泉中。崇高追寻路，天使引向前。那隻和平鸽就是天使！要安置光明会的最后一个指标，兰登再也想不出比方尖碑顶端更崇高的地方了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The damned pigeon was bronze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那隻该死的鸽子是青铜雕像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barely aware of his own actions, Langdon splashed toward the center of the fountain and began scrambling up the travertine mountain, clambering over huge arms and heads, pulling himself higher. Halfway to the base of the obelisk, he emerged from the mist and could see the head of the bird more clearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登几乎是不自觉地开始行动，他朝喷泉中央衝过去，溅起一堆水花，然后攀爬过一堆巨大的手臂和人头，奋力往上。快到方尖碑基部时，他从喷洒的水雾中冒出来，可以更清楚看见那隻鸟的头部了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no doubt. It was a dove. The bird's deceptively dark color was the result of Rome's pollution tarnishing the original bronze. Then the significance hit him. He had seen a pair of doves earlier today at the Pantheon. Apair of doves carried no meaning. This dove, however, was alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毫无疑问，那是隻和平鸽，一身骗人的晦暗颜色是罗马城污染了原来青铜材质的结果。然后他猛然想到其中含义。今天稍早，他在万神殿裡看到过一对和平鸽。一对和平鸽没有任何意义。然而这裡的和平鸽，却只有单独一隻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon rose heavenward. Toward the dove. He was almost flying now. He reached the platform from which the obelisk rose and could climb no higher. With one look around, though, he knew he didn't have to. All of Rome spread out before him. The view was stunning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登站起身，朝向那隻和平鸽。他现在简直要飞起来了。他来到方尖碑基部的台座，没法爬得更高了。不过光是朝周围看了一圈，他就晓得自己不必再往上爬。整个罗马城在他面前展开，那片景象令人震慑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bird was looking west. Langdon tried to follow its gaze, but he could not see over the buildings. He climbed higher. A quote from St. Gregory of Nyssa emerged from his memory most unexpectedly. As the soul becomes enlightened… it takes the beautiful shape of the dove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那隻鸟望著西方。兰登想循著牠的目光，但视线被前头的建筑物给挡住了。他爬得更高。完全意想不到的是，他竟然想起了四世纪神学家尼撒的圣国瑞所说过的一段话。灵魂一旦开窍……会变成和平鸽美丽的形体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Trembling, Langdon looked to the dove overhead. He turned and faced the proper direction, and then he lowered his eyes to the skyline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登颤抖著看向头顶的和平鸽，接著转身面对著适当的方向，然后他目光往下移，望著天际线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To his left, the chaotic media lights surrounding St. Peter's. To his right, the smoking cupola of Santa Maria della Vittoria. In front of him in the distance, Piazza del Popolo. Beneath him, the fourth and final point. A giant cross of obelisks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他左边，混乱的媒体灯光环绕著圣彼得教堂。在他右边，胜利圣母教堂的小圆顶正冒著烟。他前面的远方，则是人民广场。而他的脚下，则是第四点，也是最后一点。四座方尖碑构成了一个巨大的十字架。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So obvious. So clear. So deviously simple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这麽明显。这麽清楚。这麽简单得不像话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Staring at it now, Langdon could not believe the Illuminati lair had stayed hidden for so many years. The entire city seemed to fade away as he looked out at the monstrous stone structure across the river in front of him. The building was as famous as any in Rome. It stood on the banks of the Tiber River diagonally adjacent to the Vatican. The building's geometry was stark -- a circular castle, within a square fortress, and then, outside its walls, surrounding the entire structure, a park in the shape of apentagram.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登瞪著远方的目标，难以相信光明会的祕密基地居然能保密这麽多年。当他望向前方河流对岸那栋庞大的石造结构，整个城市似乎淡去了。那是罗马最有名的建筑物之一，耸立在台伯河岸上，斜邻著梵蒂冈。那栋建筑是十足的几何结构──一个圆形的城堡，位于正方形的军事堡垒中，然后墙外环绕著整座结构的，是一个五边形的公园。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a final breathtaking revelation, Langdon realized Bernini's city-wide cross of obelisks marked the fortress in perfect Illuminati fashion; the cross's central arm passeddirectly through the center of the castle's bridge, dividing it into two equal halves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一个令人惊叹的祕密是，兰登发现贝尼尼这个跨越全城的方尖碑十字架，是以完美的光明会方式标示出这个城堡；十字架的长轴正好经过圣天使桥的中央，把桥划为均等的两半。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon retrieved his tweed coat, holding it away from his dripping body. Then he jumped into the stolen sedan and rammed his soggy shoe into the accelerator, speeding off into the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ancient stone ramparts before him were dramatically lit by soft floodlights. High atop the castle stood the mammoth bronze angel. The angel pointed his sword downward at the exact center of the castle. And as if that were not enough, leading solely and directly to the castle's main entrance stood the famous Bridge of Angels… a dramatic approachway adorned by twelve towering angels carved by none other than Bernini himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="位于他前方的那道古老岩石护墙，被柔和的泛光灯照得一片明亮。城堡高高的顶端立著那尊巨大的青铜天使雕像。天使挥剑向下，指著城堡的正中央。然后好像这样还不够，正对著城堡大门的那条通道，是著名的圣天使桥……这座引人注目的桥梁两侧装饰著十二座高大的天使雕像，创作者恰恰就是贝尼尼本人。">查看中文翻译</div>
