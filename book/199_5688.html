<div class="line_en">"Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age," said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry's haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor -- Ron's parrot's beak had severed it moments before -- "I have something to say to you all.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall's desk (Neville's still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard ("Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches'). The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George's fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball -- or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night…</div>

<div class="line_en">A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he'd even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean's, Seamus's, and Ron's taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the whole. Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task. He wasn't attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric -- he had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry's tip-off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric Diggory! badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter's article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it -- and just to heighten Harry's feeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总的来说，哈利不得不承认，尽管他面临着举行舞会这件令人尴尬的事，但自从他通过第一个项目之后，生活还是大有改变。他在走廊里不再遇到那么多不愉快的冲突了，他怀疑这在很大程度上是因为塞德里克——他总觉得是塞德里克叫赫奇帕奇的同学放哈利一马的，为的是感谢哈利向他通风报信，告诉他火龙的事。而且，周围支持塞德里克·迪戈里的徽章也少多了。当然啦，德拉科·马尔福只要一有机会，还是引用丽塔·斯基特文章里的话来嘲笑他，但他得到的笑声越来越少——大概是为了给哈利愉快的心情锦上添花吧，《预言家日报》上并没有出现有关海格的报道。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn't believe half of them -- for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn't know, never having had access to a wizard's wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions -- as Binns hadn't let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn't going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy's cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些老师，如小个子的弗立维教授，看到同学们显然都心不在焉，便索性不再讲课了。他允许他们在星期三他的课上做游戏，自己则大部分时间都在跟哈利说话，谈论哈利在三强争霸赛中的第一个项目里使用的那个精彩的飞来咒。其他老师就没有这么好说话了。比如，宾斯教授的注意力是没有事情能够转移的，他还是继续在他那堆妖精造反的笔记中艰难跋涉——同学们推测，宾斯教授既然没有让自己的死亡阻挡他继续教书的道路，像圣诞节这样的小事，根本就不可能使他分心。说来真是奇怪，他居然能把血淋淋、惊心动魄的妖精造反讲得像珀西的坩埚底报告那样枯燥乏味。麦格教授和穆迪也不让学生们闲着，直到下课前的最后一秒钟。期内普就更不用说了，他宁愿收养哈利当干儿子，也不愿让同学们在课堂上做游戏。他目光阴沉地打量着全班同学，告诉他们说，他将在学期的最后一节课上测验他们的解毒药剂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas. When the decorations went up. Harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something to hear "O Come, All Ye Faithful" sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words. Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He -- er -- just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him," said Ginny. She looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron's arm sympathetically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他——嗯——他刚才邀请芙蓉·德拉库尔和他一起去参加舞会。”金妮说。她似乎正拼命忍住笑。但仍然同情地拍着罗恩的胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know what made me do it!" Ron gasped again. "What was I playing at? There were people -- all around -- I've gone mad -- everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall -- she was standing there talking to Diggory -- and it sort of came over me -- and I asked her!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道我怎么会做出这种事！”罗恩喘着粗气又说，“我在开什么玩笑呢？那里都是人——挤满了人——我真是昏了头——大家都在看着！我走过门厅时遇见了她——她站在那里正和迪戈里说话——我突然就控制不住自己——就上前问了她！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Said she's always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff- but she told him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn't want to go with Neville… I mean, who would?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，这事儿我知道！”罗恩说着笑了起来，脸上又恢复了一些血色，“他在魔药课后告诉我的！他说她一直这么善良，帮他做功课什么的——但郝敏对他说，她已经答应别人了。哈！说的跟真的似的！她只是不想跟纳威去罢了…我的意思是，谁会请她？”">查看中文翻译</div>
