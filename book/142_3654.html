<div class="line_en">Johnny's company was a girl named Sharon Moore, a New York City Greenwich Village girl in Hollywood to try for a small part in a movie being produced by an old flame who had made the big time. She had visited the set while Johnny was acting in the Woltz movie. Johnny had found her young and fresh and charming and witty, and had asked her to come to his place for dinner that evening. His invitations to dinner were always famous and had the force of royalty and of course she said yes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Johnny Fontane waved a casual dismissal to the manservant and said, "See you in the morning, Billy." The colored butler bowed his way out of the huge dining room-living room with its view of the Pacific Ocean. It was a friendly-goodbye sort of bow, not a servant's bow, and given only because Johnny Fontane had company for dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰昵·方檀漫不经心地向男佣人摆了摆手要他离开，同时还说：“比里，明早见。”黑人管家点头哈腰地退出了这间餐厅同起居室合二而一的宽敞的房子，从这里可以眺望太平洋。管家的点头哈腰是一种朋友之间告辞的表示，而不是那种仆人对主人的奴颜婢膝的表示。他所以要那样表示，是因为约翰昵·方檀有客人陪着吃饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sharon Moore obviously, expected him to come on very strong because of his reputation, but Johnny hated the Hollywood "piece of meat" approach. He never slept with any girl unless there was something about her he really liked. Except, of course, sometimes when he was very drunk and found himself in bed with a girl he didn't even remember meeting or seeing before. And now that he was thirty-five years old, divorced once, estranged from his second wife, with maybe a thousand pubic scalps dangling from his belt, he simply wasn't that eager. But there was something about Sharon Moore that aroused affection in him and so he had invited her to dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莎蓉·慕尔久闻他的大名，但约翰昵讨厌好莱坞那种“见肉就吃”的方式。他绝不随便同任何女郎睡觉，除非他真的喜欢她。当然也有例外，有时醉得不省人事，突然发现自己同一个他甚至记不得曾在哪儿遇到或看到过的女郎睡在一张床上。现在他已经三十五岁，离过婚，又同第二房老婆闹翻了，也许曾经摸过上千个女人的光屁股，因此他并不那么急切。但是，莎蓉·慕尔身上有一种韵味，激起了他心上的爱情的浪花，所以他才邀请她来吃饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He never ate much but he knew young pretty girls ambitiously starved themselves for pretty clothes and were usually big eaters on a date so there was plenty of food on the table. There was also plenty of liquor; champagne in a bucket, scotch, rye, brandy and liqueurs on the sideboard. Johnny served the drinks and the plates of food already prepared. When they had finished eating he led her into the huge living room with its glass wall that looked out onto the Pacific. He put a stack of Ella Fitzgerald records on the hifi and settled on the couch with Sharon. He made a little small talk with her, found out about what she had been like as a kid, whether she had been a tomboy or boy crazy, whether she had been homely or pretty, lonely or gay. He always found these details touching, it always evoked the tenderness he needed to make love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他饭量不大，但是他知道年轻漂亮的姑娘对漂亮衣服是贪得无厌的，在同男人约会时通常也是很能吃的，所以餐桌上摆的饭菜十分丰富。酒也不少：有用桶装的香槟酒，苏格兰威士忌，黑麦威士忌，白兰地等。食橱里还摆着各种味浓性烈的甜酒。他俩吃完饭，他领着她走进了宽敞的起居室，透过玻璃窗可以眺望太平洋。他往收录机上放莱一叠艾拉·费茨杰罗德的唱片，然后就同莎蓉一同坐在长沙发上。他同她瞎聊天，了解到她的一些情况：她小时候是个像男孩子一样顽皮的姑娘呢，还是一个迷恋男孩子的娇嫩姑娘？她原来长得普普通通呢，还是很漂亮？生性孤僻呢，还是很开朗？他始终认为这些情况是很能触动感情的，一谈这些琐碎情节就会引起他同女人睡觉时所需要的激情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Johnny laughed outright. When he had been younger, he had done just such things and the result had always been stagy, the girls trying to look sexy and melting, making their eyes swim with desire for an imagined fantasy camera. He would never dream of singing to a girl now; for one thing, he hadn't sung for months, he didn't trust his voice. For another thing, amateurs didn't realize how much professionals depended on technical help to sound as good as they did. He could have played his records but he felt the same shyness about hearing his youthful passionate voice as an aging, balding man running to fat feels about showing pictures of himself as a youth in the full bloom of manhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰昵忍不住大笑起来。想当年他还年轻的时候，本来也干过这种事，效果也一直像演戏一样，姑娘们故意装出肉感的媚态，显得软绵绵的，把眼睛也弄得泪汪汪的，充满了欲望。现在他绝不再对一个姑娘唱歌了：其一，他已经好几个月没有唱了，对自己的嗓子也没有把握；其二，外行人根本不明白，职业演员是如何借助了技术设备的帮助才能唱得那么好听。他本来可以放放当年灌的唱片，但是他现在一听到自己那充满青春活力的热情奔放的声音就感到害臊，好像一个上了年纪、秃顶发胖的老头子，把自己当年风华正茂的照片拿给人看时感到的那种害臊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He got up to give her a refill on her brandy glass, gave her a gold-monogrammed cigarette and flashed his lighter out to hold the light for her. She puffed on the cigarette and sipped her drink and he sat down beside her again. His glass had considerably more brandy in it than hers, he needed it to warm himself, to cheer himself, to charge himself up. His situation was the reverse of the lover's usual one. He had to get himself drunk instead of the girl. The girl was usually too willing where he was not. The last two years had been hell on his ego, and he used this simple way to restore it, sleeping with a young fresh girl for one night, taking her to dinner a few times, giving her an expensive present and then brushing her off in the nicest way possible so that her feelings wouldn't be hurt. And then they could always say they had had a thing with the great Johnny Fontane. It wasn't true love, but you couldn't knock it if the girl was beautiful and genuinely nice. He hated the hard, bitchy ones, the ones who screwed for him and then rushed off to tell their friends that they'd screwed the great Johnny Fontane, always adding that they'd had better. What amazed him more than anything else in his career were the complaisant husbands who almost told him to his face that they forgave their wives since it was allowed for even the most virtuous matron to be unfaithful with a great singing and movie star like Johnny Fontane. That really floored him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站起来，给她的玻璃杯里又斟满了白兰地，给她递了一支上面有金色图案的香烟，还打着打火机给她点烟。她一面抽烟，一面喝酒；他又在她的身旁坐下来。他玻璃杯里的酒比她的多得多，他需要酒来使自己发热、兴奋、冲动。他现在的情况与情人幽会时的一般情况相反，需要把酒喝醉的是他本人而不是姑娘。姑娘通常都是满心情愿的，而他自己却有点鼓不起劲来。最近两年他对他的身体实在太恼火了。他就用这个简单的方法来使自己的身体恢复活力：同一个年轻的姑娘睡一夜，请她吃几顿饭，送给她一件贵重礼物，然后用最巧妙的方式一甩手让她去，而不伤害她的感情。过后，她们还可以随时说她们曾同赫赫有名的约翰昵·方檀有过一段交情。这不是真正的爱情，但是若遇到漂亮而又真正可爱的姑娘，这类事也不能禁绝。他讨厌那种死乞白赖的淫荡货，这种女人先是步步紧逼，然后又拂袖而去。她们见了自己的朋友就说她们曾经把赫赫有名的约翰昵·方檀诱上了钩，说完之后照例还要补充一句，劝她们的朋友最好也去试一试。但使他百思不得一解的是，那些讨好卖乖的丈夫的表现简直等于当面告诉他说：他们原谅自己的老婆。因为他们认为，即使是最贞节的婆娘，同约翰昵·方檀这样一位歌唱家兼电影明星勾搭，也是情有可原的。这可真叫他甘拜下风。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was ready now. He put his drink down on the long inlaid cocktail table and turned his body toward her. He was very sure, very deliberate, and yet tender. There was nothing sly or lecherously lascivious in his caresses. He kissed her on the lips while his hands rose to her breasts. His hand fell to her warm thighs, the skin so silky to his touch. Her returning kiss was warm but not passionate and he preferred it that way right now. He hated girls who turned on all of a sudden as if their bodies were motors galvanized into erotic pumpings by the touching of a hairy switch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿他已经准备好了。他把酒杯放在长长的嵌花矮桌上，然后转过身子对着她。他非常有把握，非常沉着，也很柔和。在他爱抚的表示里，既没有掩饰也没有放纵情欲的狂热。他吻了她的嘴唇，而他的手却垂到了她的胸前。他的手落到她温暖的大腿上，他的皮肤摸上去很柔滑。她的吻是温暖的，但不是热情的，他现在喜欢这样。他不喜欢女孩的性欲就像是发动机被毛茸茸的开关触发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He loved Ella Fitzgerald on records. He loved that kind of clean singing, that kind of clean phrasing. It was the only thing in life he really understood and he knew he understood it better than anyone else on earth. Now lying back on the couch, the brandy warming his throat, he felt a desire to sing, not music, but to phrase with the records, yet it was something impossible to do in front of a stranger. He put his free hand in Sharon's lap, sipping his drink from his other hand. Without any slyness but with the sensualness of a child seeking warmth, his hand in her lap pulled up the silk of her dress to show milky white thigh above the sheer netted gold of her stockings and as always, despite all the women, all the years, all the familiarity, Johnny felt the fluid sticky warmness flooding through his body at that sight. The miracle still happened, and what would he do when that failed him as his voice had?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他喜爱唱片上的艾拉·费茨杰罗德的录音，喜爱那种干干净净的歌唱，那种清清爽爽的歌词，这是他真正理解的生活中唯一的东西。他知道他对这一点的理解比世界上任何人的理解都要深刻得多。这会儿他仰靠在沙发上，白兰地酒在使他喉咙发热，感到了一种想唱歌的欲望，不是唱唱曲调，而是随着唱片哼哼歌词，但是在陌生人面前是不能这样做的。他一只手端着酒杯在呷酒，随便把另一只手搭在莎蓉的大腿上，把裙子往上一掀，亮出了乳白色的大腿。要是他在这方面也像他的嗓子一样变得力不从心，那可怎么办哪？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he did something he always did, something that had never yet failed to arouse him. Delicately and as lightly as it was possible to do so and still feel something, he brushed the tip of his middle finger deep down between her thighs. Some girls never even felt that initial move toward lovemaking. Some were distracted by it, not sure it was a physical touch because at the same time he always kissed them deeply on the mouth. Still others seemed to suck in his finger or gobble it up with a pelvic thrust. And of course before he became famous, some girls had slapped his face. It was his whole technique and usually it served him well enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他做了一件他一直做的事，这件事从来没有引起过他的注意。他轻轻地轻轻地摸了摸，仍然感到有些东西，他把他的中指尖深深地夹在大腿之间。有些女孩甚至没感觉开始做爱。有些人被它分散了注意力，不确定这是一种身体接触，因为同时他总是深深地吻他们的嘴。还有一些人似乎吮吸他的手指，或者用骨盆刺把它吞了下去。当然，在他成名之前，有些女孩打了他的耳光。这是他的全部技术，通常对他很好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sharon's reaction was unusual. She accepted it all, the touch, the kiss, then shifted her mouth off his, shifted her body ever so slightly back along the couch and picked up her drink. It was a cool but definite refusal. It happened sometimes. Rarely; but it happened. Johnny picked up his drink and lit a cigarette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莎伦的反应是不寻常的。她接受了这一切，抚摸，亲吻，她把她的嘴唇从他的嘴唇上挪开，把她在沙发上仰卧着的身子微微一扭，伸手拿起了酒杯，这是一种冷静的但也是明白无误的拒绝。以往也曾发生过这样的事，偶尔发生过，但毕竟是发生过。约翰呢也端起自己的酒杯，抽了一支香烟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't like her quite so much now. She was sweet, she was witty, she was intelligent. She hadn't fallen all over herself to screw for him or try to hustle him because his connections would help her in show biz. She was really a straight kid. But there was something else he recognized. It had happened a few times before. The girl who went on a date with her mind all made up not to go to bed with him, no matter how much she liked him, just so that she could tell her friends, and even more, herself, that she had turned down a chance to screw for the great Johnny Fontane. It was something he understood now that he was older and he wasn't angry. He just didn't like her quite that much and he had really liked her a lot.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had, finally, been a little too cruel and he felt stricken at the hurt on her young face. She understood that he was telling her that he hadn't tried too hard. He had taken the sweetness of her victory away from her. Now she would feel that it had been her lack of charm or attractiveness that had made her the victor this night. And being the girl she was, when she told the story of how she resisted the great Johnny Fontane, she would always have to add with a wry little smile, "Of course, he didn't try very hard."

<div class="line_en">He was left with a long evening before him. He could have used what Jack Woltz called the "meat factory," the stable of willing starlets, but he wanted human companionship. He wanted to talk like a human being. He thought of his first wife, Virginia. Now that the work on the picture was finished he would have more time for the kids. He wanted to become part of their life again. And he worried about Virginia too.

<div class="line_en">She looked thirty-five. A good thirty-five, but thirty-five. And out here in Hollywood that might as well be a hundred. The young beautiful girls thronged through the city like lemmings, lasting one year, some two. Some of them so beautiful they could make a man's heart almost stop beating until they opened their mouths, until the greedy hopes for success clouded the loveliness of their eyes. Ordinary women could never hope to compete with them on a physical level. And you could talk all you wanted to about charm, about intelligence, about chic, about poise, the raw beauty of these girls overpowered everything else. Perhaps if there were not so many of them there might be a chance for an ordinary, nice-looking woman. And since Johnny Fontane could have all of them, or nearly all of them, Ginny knew that he was saying all this just to flatter her. He had always been nice that way. He had always been polite to women even at the height of his fame, paying them compliments, holding lights for their cigarettes, opening doors. And since an this was usually done for him, it made it even more impressive to the girls he went out with. And he did it with all girls, even the one-night stands, I-don't-know-your-name girls.</div>

The one thing he had fought about, and for, was his position as a father to them. In a very sly way he had made Ginny understand he would not be pleased by her remarrying, not because he was jealous of her, but because he was jealous of his position as a father. He had arranged the money to be paid to her so it would be enormously to her advantage financially not to remarry. It was understood that she could have lovers as long as they were not introduced into her home life. But on this score he had absolute faith in her. She had always been amazingly shy and old-fashioned in sex. The Hollywood gigolos had batted zero when they started swarming around her, sniffing for the financial settlement and the favors they could get from her famous husband.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had traveled with the band singing and then he had become a radio star and a star of the movie stage shows and then he had finally made it in the movies. And in all that time he had lived the way he wanted to, screwed the women he wanted to, but he had never let it affect his personal life. Then he had fallen for his soon to be second wife, Margot Ashton; he had gone absolutely crazy for her. His career had gone to hell, his voice had gone to hell, his family life had gone to hell. And there had come the day when he was left without anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他原来是跟着乐团到处旅行的，走到哪儿就在哪儿唱歌。接着他就成了无线电广播剧的明星，电影剧团舞台演出时的明星。最后他终于参加拍摄电影了。在这一段时间，他的生活是如意的，他想要怎么生活就怎么生活，他想要勾引哪个女人就勾引哪个女人，但是他绝对不让这类事情影响他的个人生活。后来他就拜倒在玛葛特·娅希彤的裙下，她很快成了他的第二房妻子；他想她真是到了发疯的地步。于是他的事业就活见鬼了，他的嗓子活见鬼了，他的家庭也活见鬼了。最后他终于落得个山穷水尽，走投无路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thing was, he had always been generous and fair. He had given his first wife everything he owned when he divorced her. He had made sure his two daughters would get a piece of everything he made, every record, every movie, every club date. And when he had been rich and famous he had refused his first wife nothing. He had helped out all her brothers and sisters, her father and mother, the girl friends she had gone to school with and their families. He had never been a stuck-up celebrity. He had sung at the weddings of his wife's two younger sisters, something he hated to do. He had never refused her anything except the complete surrender of his own personality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关键的问题是，他为人一向大方，正派。当他同他第一房妻子离婚时，他把自己所有的一切都交给了她。他还保证：他赚得一切，灌的每张唱片，演出的每部电影，以及每次在夜总会的表演，总之，一切活动所得，他的两个女儿都将分到一份。当年他有钱有名，也没有克扣过他的第一房妻子；他慷慨地帮助过她的兄弟姐妹，她的父母，她小时候一道上过学的女同学以及她们的家属。他从来都不是势利之徒。他曾在他妻子的两个妹妹的婚礼上唱过歌，这本来是他不愿干的。他从来没有拒绝过她提出来的任何要求。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had never forgotten the look on Ginny's face when she found out about all his misfortunes. It had passed over her face only for a second but that was enough for him never to forget it. It was a look of savage and joyful satisfaction. It was a look that could only make him believe that she had contemptuously hated him all these years. She quickly recovered and offered him cool but polite sympathy. He had pretended to accept it. During the next few days he had gone to see three of the girls he had liked the most over the years, girls he had remained friends with and sometimes still slept with in a comradely way, girls that he had done everything in his power to help, girls to whom he had given the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts or job opportunities. On their faces he had caught that same fleeting look of savage satisfaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琪妮在了解到他的种种不幸遭遇时，脸上流露出来的神情，他一直没有忘记。那种神情在她脸上仅仅出现了一秒钟，但这已足够使他永远难忘了。那是一种幸灾乐祸的神情。那种神情只能使他相信：这几年来她一直在鄙视他，恨他。但她很快就恢复了常态，向他表示了冷漠而礼貌的同情。他也故意装糊涂，对她的同情表示感谢。在随后的一些日子里，他曾去看过他多年来最喜欢的一些女郎中的三个女郎，他同这些女郎一直保持着友谊，有时还同她们友好地在一起睡觉。他曾经尽了力所能及的一切去帮助过她们，他给这些女郎送的礼物或提供的工作机会，若折合成钱的话，等于十几万美元。在她们的脸上，他也瞥见了同样幸灾乐祸的神情一闪而过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then when he had touched bottom, when he could no longer get movie work, when he could no longer sing, when his second wife had betrayed him, he had gone to spend a few days with Ginny and his daughters. He had more or less flung himself on her mercy one night because he felt so lousy. That day he had heard one of his recordings and he had sounded so terrible that he accused the song technicians of sabotaging the record. Until finally he had become convinced that that was what his voice really sounded like. He had smashed the master record and refused to sing anymore. He was so ashamed that he had not sung a note except with Nino at Connie Corleone's wedding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他倒霉的时候，当他得不到电影拍摄工作的时候，当他再也不能唱歌的时候，当他的第二房妻子背叛了他的时候，他就来同琪妮和他们的女儿过上几天。一天晚上他因为感到无地自容，多少有点像是要求她的宽容。那天他听了自己灌的唱片，他的声音难听极了，他还责怪录音技师故意捣鬼，暗中破坏了录音效果。最后他才确信，他的声音本来就是那个样子。他把那张唱片砸碎了，以后就拒不唱歌。他感到非常惭愧，因此除了在康妮·考利昂的婚礼上同尼诺那次合唱之后，他连一个音符也没有唱过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was during that time that he knew he had to make a decision. He could become like a great many other men in Hollywood, successful producers, writers, directors, actors, who preyed on beautiful women with lustful hatred. He could use power and monetary favors grudgingly, always alert for treason, always believing that women would betray and desert him, adversaries to be bested. Or he could refuse to hate women and continue to believe in them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这段时间里，他懂得了他必须下个决心：他得学学好莱坞许多其他男人的样子，比方那些飞黄腾达的制片厂厂长、作家、主任、演员，一个个像猛兽一样，怀着性欲的仇恨扑向漂亮女人。在为别人使用自己的魔力和金钱方面，他满可以吝啬吝啬、计较计较、以防背叛，还要时刻注意女人出卖他、遗弃他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew he could not afford not to love them, that something of his spirit would die if he did not continue to love women no matter how treacherous and unfaithful they were. It didn't matter that the women he loved most in the world were secretly glad to see him crushed, humiliated, by a wayward fortune; it did not matter that in the most awful way, not sexually, they had been unfaithful to him. He had no choice. He had to accept them. And so he made love to all of them, gave them presents, hid the hurt their enjoyment of his misfortunes gave him. He forgave them knowing he was being paid back for having lived in the utmost freedom from women and in the fullest flush of their favor. But now he never felt guilty about being untrue to them. He never felt guilty about how he treated Ginny, insisting on remaining the sole father of his children, yet never even considering remarrying her, and letting her know that too. That was one thing he had salvaged out of his fall from the top. He had grown a thick skin about the hurts he gave women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他心里明白，不去爱女人，他是受不了的；不管女人是多么背信弃义，水性杨花，如果他不继续爱她们，那他的精神中的某些方面就会死亡。而他最爱的那些女人却暗暗喜欢看到他受命运的捉弄而毁灭、而出丑，这也没有关系；那些女人一直对他喜怒无常，方式很骇人听闻，但不是在性爱方面，这也没有关系。他没有别的办法，无法拒绝她们。因此他向她们都表示爱情，给她们送礼物；她们的幸灾乐祸给他带来的伤害，他藏在心里。他过去生活在不受女人左右的极端自由之中，生活在人情味最充分的氛围之中，他明白他已得到报应，因此他原谅她们。但是目前他对她们不忠，他却一点儿不感到内疚。回顾他是怎么对待琪妮的，他也一点儿不感到内疚。他一方面坚持要继续独占他的孩子的父亲地位，另一方面却绝不考虑同贼复婚，也不把这一点明确告诉她。他从顶峰跌落下来，一切都丢光了，唯一抢救下来的也就是这个作风。说到他对女人造成的创伤，他已经变得麻木不仁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
