<div class="line_en">Sheer curiosity was also a powerful motive, and so was a determination to get his own back for the trick that had been played upon him. It was perfectly obvious now that Karellen had used him as a bait, and even if this had been for the best of reasons, Stormgren did not feel inclined to forgive the Supervisor at once.</div>

<div class="line_en">It would never have occurred to Stormgren, even a few days before, that he could seriously have considered the action he was planning now. This ridiculously melodramatic kidnapping, which in retrospect seemed like a third-rate TV drama, probably had a great deal to do with his new outlook. It was the first time in his life that Stormgren had ever been exposed to violent physical action, as opposed to the verbal battles of the conference room. The virus must have entered his bloodstream; or else he was merely approaching second childhood more quickly than he had supposed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在几天前，斯妥格恩还根本没有想过自己会去认真考虑这个计划。那段有趣得近乎荒唐的绑架经历，回想起来不过是一部三流电视剧，但自己的想法却从此改变了。平生第一次遭遇的暴力事件和会议室里的唇枪舌战竟是如此不同，究竟是它的病毒进入了自己的血液，使得自己采取这样的行动呢，还是自己正在提前进入智力衰退期？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pierre Duval showed no surprise when Stormgren walked unannounced into his office. They were old friends and there was nothing unusual in the Secretary-General paying a personal visit to the Chief of the Science Bureau. Certainly Karellen would not think it odd, if by any chance he -- or one of his underlings -- turned his instruments of surveillance upon this spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩没有预先通知皮埃尔·杜弗，径自来到了他的办公室，对方也没有丝毫吃惊，两人是多年的好友了。秘书长因私拜访科技部主任也没什么特别，就算卡瑞林本人或他的手下碰巧监视到这里，也不会察觉什么异样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a while the two men talked business and exchanged political gossip; then, rather hesitantly, Stormgren came to the point. As his visitor talked, the old Frenchman leaned back in his chair and his eyebrows rose steadily, millimetre by millimetre, until they were almost entangled in his forelock. Once or twice he seemed about to speak, but each time thought better of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人闲聊了一会儿贸易和政治，斯妥格恩才犹犹豫豫地谈到正事。这位法国朋友靠着椅背端坐着，眉毛越扬越高，几乎都要连到头发里去了。有那么一两次，他想插话，又终于忍住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“听不到的。为了保护我，他在我身上装了个叫跟踪器的玩意儿，这东西在地下不管用，所以我才到你这‘地牢’里来。这个房间能阻隔各种波，是吧？卡瑞林不是魔术师，他只知道我到了这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a very pretty problem. I like it," he said simply. Then he dived into a drawer and produced an enormous writing-pad, quite the biggest that Stormgren had ever seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好计划，我喜欢。”他简洁地说，弯腰从抽屉里取出一本大得惊人的便笺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There isn't much to describe. It's made of metal, and is about eight metres square and four high. The vision screen is about a metre on a side and there's a desk immediately beneath it -- here, it will be quicker if I draw it for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么好讲的，那房间是金属的，八米见方，四米高；墙上嵌着一个正方形屏幕，边长一米；屏幕正下方摆放着一张桌子，我画出来更快些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rapidly Stormgren sketched the little room he knew so well, and pushed the drawing over to DuvaL As he did so, he recalled, with a slight shiver, the last time he had done this sort of thing. He wondered what had happened to the blind Welsh-man and his confederates, and how they had reacted to his abrupt departure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，他画出了那个熟悉的房间的摆设，把它推给杜弗看。他想起上次做这个动作时的情形，不由得打了个哆嗦，也不知那个瞎眼的威尔士人和他那帮手下现在如何，他们会对自己的突然消失有何反应呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right," he began, scribbling furiously in what seemed to be some private shorthand. "Let me make sure I have all the facts. Tell me everything you can about the room in which you have your interviews. Don't omit any detail, however trivial it seems."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The whole ceiling is luminous, and as far as I can tell the air comes through the speaker grille. I don't know how it leaves; perhaps the stream reverses at intervals, but I haven't noticed it. There's no sign of any heater, but the room is always at normal temperature."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“整个天花板都是亮的，空气从通话口进来，怎么出去的就不知道了，也许采用的是循环换气吧，我没注意到。没有看到任何取暖设备，但房间是恒温的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你就只能告诉我这些？”杜弗轻蔑地哼了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stormgren smiled at the characteristic outburst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面对如此火爆的脾气，斯妥格恩微笑处之。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was silence for several minutes while the physicist embroidered his writing-pad with meticulous and microscopic doodles. As he watched, Stormgren wondered why it was that a man like Duval -- whose mind was incomparably more brilliant than his own -- had never made a greater mark in the world of science. He remembered an unkind and probably inaccurate comment of a friend in the U. S. State Department. "The French produce the best second-raters in the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杜弗在便笺边上涂抹着那些细小的符号，没有说话。斯妥格恩望着他，不明白这个比自己聪明许多的人为何没能在科学上有更大的建树。美国部的一位朋友有一句不怎么友好、也不够准确的话：“法国出产最好的二流人物。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I find that suspicious in itself. I'm sure the Overlord's own apparatus won't use anything so crude as an actual physical screen -- they'll probably materialize images directly in space. But why should Karellen bother to use a TV system, anyway? The simplest solution is always best. Doesn't it seem far more probable that your vision-screen' is really nothing more complicated than a sheet of one-way glass?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就值得怀疑了。外星人不会采用这样原始的手段，他们应该有能力在空中直接合成图像，为什么要不嫌麻烦地使用电视系统呢？最简单的解释就是最好的解释，你说的屏幕会不会是一块单向透明玻璃？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="杜弗自得地点点头，往前倾着身子，笔指着斯妥格恩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What makes you think, Rikki," he asked, "that Karellen's vision-screen, as you call it, really is what it pretends to be?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雷克，你怎么会认为那东西是个屏幕，而不是别的什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Duval was the sort of man who supported that statement.</div>

<div class="line_en">"When you say that it looks like a vision-screen, you mean, don't you, that it looks like one of ours?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stormgren was so annoyed with himself that for a moment he sat in silence, retracing the past. From the beginning, he had never challenged Karellen's story -- yet now he came to look back, when had the Supervisor ever told him that he was using a TV system? He had simply taken it for granted; the whole thing had been a piece of psychological trickery, and he had been completely deceived. Always assuming, of course, that Duval's theory was correct. But he was jumping to conclusions again; no one had proved anything yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩没有回答，只是努力回忆着。他从不怀疑卡瑞林的话，但对方何曾说过使用电视机？都是自己的直观印象罢了，在这个心理游戏里，自己完全被骗了，当然首先得假设杜弗的推测正确，而现在又无法证实，只能回到那个老掉牙的结论：没有人能证明什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

Surely it was not possible for the Supervisor to have communicated with his distant home, across the unknown numbers of light years that separated him from his base.

<div class="line_en">Stormgren was silent for a while, absorbing the Supervisor's words. He felt little of the satisfaction that Karellen's statement would once have given him. Indeed, he was somewhat confused by his partial success, and for a moment his resolution faltered. The truth would come with the passage of time: all his plotting was unnecessary and perhaps unwise. If he still went ahead, it would be only for the selfish reason that he would not be alive in fifty years.</div>

Karellen had always treated him with unmistakable affection, despite his occasional devastating frankness, and now that their time together was drawing to its close he did not wish to do anything that might spoil that relationship. But the Supervisor had received due warning, and Stormgren had the conviction that if the choice had been his, Karellen would long ago have shown himself.

<div class="line_en">"You can put it that way," said Karellen -- and now his voice held a clear yet inexplicable note of sadness that left Stormgren strangely perturbed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以这样讲。”卡瑞林说着，声音明显地带上了伤感。斯妥格恩不安起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Karellen, so softly that Stormgren could scarcely hear him. "We have had our failures."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”卡瑞林说话的声音低得几乎听不清，“我们也失败过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But suppose, after all, your experiment fails with Man? We have known such things in our own dealings with primitive human races. Surely you have your failures too?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，你们的实验有可能会失败，我们和原始部落打交道时就碰到过类似情况。你们肯定也会失败吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a pause lasting perhaps five seconds. When Karellen spoke again, his words were so unexpected that for a moment Stormgren did not react.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="双方沉默了约五秒钟，卡瑞林突然开口道别，“再见了，雷克。”太突然了，斯妥格恩一下没反应过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And what do you do then?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你们怎么办呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Karellen had tricked him -- probably it was already too late. Stormgren's paralysis lasted only a moment. Then, with a single swift, well-practised movement, he whipped out the flash gun and jammed it against the glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林骗了他——可能已经太迟了。斯妥格恩一会才回过神来。然后，他用一个快速而熟练的动作，猛地拿出闪光灯，把它猛击在玻璃上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We wait -- and try again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们就等待，再从头开始。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The pine trees came almost to the edge of the lake, leaving along its border only a narrow strip of grass a few metres wide. Every evening when it was warm enough Stormgren, despite his ninety years, would walk along this strip to the landing-stage, watch the sunlight die upon the water, and then return to the house before the chill night wind came up from the forest. The simple ritual gave him much contentment, and he would continue it as long as he had the strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="松树林一直延伸到湖畔，只在水边留出一带几米宽的草坪。每天傍晚，只要天气暖和，斯妥格恩，已经九十高龄了，会顺着小道一直走到码头去，看着晚霞在湖面上消失，然后赶在树林刮起寒冷的晚风之前回到住处。这样的生活，他很满足，只要还有一丝力气他就会坚持下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Far away over the lake something was coming in from the west, flying low and fast. Aircraft were uncommon in these parts, unless one counted the trans-polar liners which must be passing overhead every hour of the day and night. But there was never any sign of their presence, save an occasional vapour trail high against the blue of the stratosphere. This machine was a small helicopter, and it was coming towards him with obvious determination. Stormgren glanced along the beach and saw that there was no chance of escape. Then he shrugged his shoulders and sat down on the wooden bench at the head of the jetty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远处湖面上有个什么东西从西边飞来了，飞得很低，但速度很快。飞机在这一带很少见，每小时一班的跨极地班机会从头顶飞过，但从来没看见过，只是偶尔能瞥到飞机飞过后在蓝天上留下的一抹残痕。那是架小型直升机，正冲自己飞来。他看看湖滩，无路可逃，便无可奈何地耸耸肩，走到堤岸尽头的木凳上坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The reporter was so deferential that Stormgren found it surprising. He had almost forgotten that he was not only an elder statesman but, outside his own country, almost a mythical figure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那记者一副毕恭毕敬的样子，很让他吃惊，他几乎忘了自己不仅是一位资深政治家，而且，还是个传奇人物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr. Stormgren," the intruder began, "I'm very sorry to bother you, but I wonder if you'd care to comment on something we've just heard about the Overlords."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斯妥格恩先生，”那记者说，“很抱歉打搅你，我们听说一则和外星人有关的消息，想听听你的看法。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stormgren frowned slightly. After all these years, he still shared Karellen's dislike for that word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他微微皱了皱眉头，这么多年过去了，他还是和卡瑞林一样不喜欢这样的字眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I thought that you might. A rather strange story has just come to our notice. It seems that, nearly thirty years ago, one of the Science Bureau's technicians made some remarkable equipment for you. We wondered if you could tell us anything about it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有，我们打听到一个奇怪的说法。大约三十年前，科技部的一名工程师替您设计过一个特别的仪器。你能谈谈这个吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The reporter was watching him with a curious intentness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那记者好奇地看着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment Stormgren was silent, his mind going back into the past. He was not surprised that the secret had been discovered. Indeed, it was surprising that it had been kept so tong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩无言地陷入了沉思。这个秘密会被发现早在自己的预料之中，没什么好奇怪的，奇怪的是竟隐藏了这么久。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not think," he said, "that I can add a great deal to what has been written elsewhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想这方面的报道已够多了，我没什么可补充的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rose to his feet and began to walk back along the jetty, the reporter following a few paces behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站起身，顺着堤岸往回走，记者紧跟在后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He chuckled to himself and then continued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他自嘲地笑了笑，然后接着往下讲：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The story," he said, "contains a certain amount of truth. On my last visit to Karellen's ship I took some apparatus with me, in the hope that I might be able to see the Supervisor. It was rather a foolish thing to do, but -- well, I was only sixty at the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有这么回事。我最后一次和卡瑞林会谈时，就带上了那个仪器，希望能看到他的样子。结果证明那是件蠢事，要知道，我那时才六十岁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not much of a story to have brought you all this way. You see, it didn't work."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You saw nothing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你什么都没看见？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Twenty years to go. Yes, Karellen had been right. By then the world would be ready, as it had not been when he had spoken that same lie to Duval thirty years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有二十年，卡瑞林说得对，那时，世界上一切都准备就绪，可以和外星人见面了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Karellen had trusted him, and Stormgren had not betrayed his faith. He was as sure as he could be of anything that the Supervisor had known his plan from the beginning, and had foreseen every moment of its final act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林信任自己，自己总算也没有出卖自己的忠诚。卡瑞林从一开始就知道自己的计划，也早料到了自己的最后一举。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, nothing at all. I'm afraid you'll have to wait -- but after all, there are only twenty years to go!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，什么都没有。等着吧，毕竟只有二十年了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why else had that enormous chair been already empty when the circle of light blazed upon it! In the same moment he had started to swing the beam, fearing that he was too late. The metal door, twice as high as a man, was closing swiftly when he first caught sight of it -- closing swiftly, yet not quite swiftly enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么光线照在那把巨大的椅子上，卡瑞林早不在了呢？他着急地晃动那只闪光灯，看到那扇两人高的铁门正在快速关上，说快，但也不是特别快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, Karellen had trusted him, had not wished him to go down into the long evening of his life haunted by a mystery he could never solve. Karellen dared not defy the unknown powers above him (were they of that same race also?) but he had done all that he could. If he had disobeyed them, they could never prove it. It was the final proof, Stormgren knew, of Karellen's affection for him. Though it might be the affection of a man for a devoted and intelligent dog, it was none the less sincere for that, and Stormgren's life had given him few greater satisfactions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，卡瑞林信任自己，不想自己因为一个没有解开的谜团在余生的岁月里彻夜难眠，但他又不敢违背自己的统治者。他们会是同一种族吗？他已经尽了力，就算没有谨遵号令，统治者也拿不出证据来。一切都证明卡瑞林是爱护自己的，这种情感多少有点像是人对自己那只忠实又聪明的狗的疼爱，但那是真心的。想到这儿，斯妥格恩从来没有这样知足过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have had our failures."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们也失败过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, Karellen, that was true; and were you the one who failed, before the dawn of human history? It must have been a failure indeed, thought Stormgren, for its echoes to roll down all the ages, to haunt the childhood of every race of man. Even In fifty years, could you overcome the power of all the myths and legends of the world?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，卡瑞林，是这样。在人类历史之初失败的是不是就是你？你肯定有过那么一次失败的经历，经历了那么多年，它还一直存在人们的记忆里，人们从小就能听到这样的故事，五十年后，你能战胜世界上所有的神话、传奇对人们的影响吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Stormgren hoped that when Karellen was free to walk once more on Earth, he would one day come to these northern forests, and stand beside the grave of the first man to be his friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩希望，卡瑞林到地球之后，能到这个北欧的森林来，站在自己的墓边，看望他的第一位人类朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet Stormgren knew there would be no second failure. When the two races met again, the Overlords would have won the trust and friendship of mankind, and not even the shock of recognition could undo that work. They would go together into the future, and the unknown tragedy that must have darkened the past would be lost forever down the dim corridors of prehistoric time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而斯妥格恩知道不会有第二次失败。当两个种族再次相遇时，外星人将赢得人类的信任和友谊，即使是被承认的震惊也不能使这项工作付诸东流。他们将一起走向未来，而那场未知的悲剧将永远消失在史前时代昏暗的走廊上。">查看中文翻译</div>
