She told the captain as much, but even the iron coin did not sway him. Arya never seemed to find the places she set out to reach. Yoren had sworn to deliver her to Winterfell, only she had ended up in Harrenhal and Yoren in his grave. When she escaped Harrenhal for Riverrun, Lem and Anguy and Tom o' Sevens took her captive and dragged her to the hollow hill instead. Then the Hound had stolen her and dragged her to the Twins.

<div class="line_en">If truth be told, Arya did not know what to wish for, any more than she knew what awaited her beneath that distant light. The captain had given her passage but he had no time to speak with her. Some of the crew shunned her, but others gave her gifts -- a silver fork, fingerless gloves, a floppy woolen hat patched with leather. One man showed her how to tie sailor's knots. Another poured her thimble cups of fire wine. The friendly ones would tap their chests, repeating their names over and over until Arya said them back, though none ever thought to ask her name. They called her Salty, since she'd come aboard at Saltpans, near the mouth of the Trident. It was as good a name as any, she supposed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Titan of Braavos. Old Nan had told them stories of the Titan back in Winterfell. He was a giant as tall as a mountain, and whenever Braavos stood in danger he would wake with fire in his eyes, his rocky limbs grinding and groaning as he waded out into the sea to smash the enemies. "The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls," Nan would end, and Sansa would give a stupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old Nan's stories were only stories.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winterfell is burned and fallen, Arya reminded herself. Old Nan and Maester Luwin were both dead, most like, and Sansa too. It did no good to think of them. All men must die. That was what the words meant, the words that Jaqen H'ghar had taught her when he gave her the worn iron coin. She had learned more Braavosi words since they left Saltpans, the words for please and thank you and sea and star and fire wine, but she came to them knowing that all men must die. Most of the Daughter's crew had a smattering of the Common Tongue from nights ashore in Oldtown and King's Landing and Maidenpool, though only the captain and his sons spoke it well enough to talk to her. Denyo was the youngest of those sons, a plump, cheerful boy of twelve who kept his father's cabin and helped his eldest brother do his sums.</div>

<div class="line_en">"All gods are honored in Braavos." The captain's son loved to talk about his city almost as much as he loved to talk about his father's ship. "Your Seven have a sept here, the Sept-Beyond-the-Sea, but only Westerosi sailors worship there."</div>

"Or do you have the Seven?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事。”即使泰坦真的会吃粉嫩的小女孩，艾莉亚也不怕。反正她骨瘦如柴，怎配给巨人当美餐？而且她快满十一岁了，几乎算是成年女子。再说，阿盐又不是贵族。“泰坦是布拉佛斯的神吗？”她问，“还是你们也崇拜七神？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They are not my Seven. They were my mother's gods, and they let the Freys murder her at the Twins. She wondered whether she would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its heart. Denyo might know, but she could not ask him. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told herself, with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she remembered her father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the pack survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the pack had been taken and slain and skinned.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Titan's eyes seemed brighter now, and farther apart. Arya did not know any Many-Faced God, but if he answered prayers, he might be the god she sought. Ser Gregor, she thought, Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei. Only six now. Joffrey was dead, the Hound had slain Polliver, and she'd stabbed the Tickler herself, and that stupid squire with the pimple. I wouldn't have killed him if he hadn't grabbed me. The Hound had been dying when she left him on the banks of the Trident, burning up with fever from his wound. I should have given him the gift of mercy and put a knife into his heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mists gave way before them, ragged grey curtains parted by their prow. The Titan's Daughter cleaved through the grey-green waters on billowing purple wings. Arya could hear the cries of seabirds overhead. There, where Denyo pointed, a line of stony ridges rose sudden from the sea, their steep slopes covered with soldier pines and black spruce. But dead ahead the sea had broken through, and there above the open water the Titan towered, with his eyes blazing and his long green hair blowing in the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迷雾在面前退散，船首分割了参差不齐的灰色幕帘。泰坦之女号劈开灰绿色水面，风帆犹如翻腾的紫色翅膀。艾莉亚听见头顶海鸟的尖叫。德尼奥手指之处，一排岩石山脊从海面骤然升起，陡峭的坡道上覆盖着士卒松和黑云杉，但正前方有个缺口，泰坦巨人矗立在此，眼中闪光，绿色长发迎风飞舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His legs bestrode the gap, one foot planted on each mountain, his shoulders looming tall above the jagged crests. His legs were carved of solid stone, the same black granite as the sea monts on which he stood, though around his hips he wore an armored skirt of greenish bronze. His breastplate was bronze as well, and his head in his crested halfhelm. His blowing hair was made of hempen ropes dyed green, and huge fires burned in the caves that were his eyes. One hand rested atop the ridge to his left, bronze fingers coiled about a knob of stone; the other thrust up into the air, clasping the hilt of a broken sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的双腿踩在缺口两边，各自踏住一座山，宽阔的肩膀则笼罩在崎岖的山峰上方，那双腿由顽石砌成，跟站立之处的黑色花岗岩海礁质地相同。巨人腰间系一件绿色青铜战裙，胸甲也是青铜，头戴冠饰半盔，飘荡的头发为染绿的麻绳，眼睛是两个山洞，大火堆在其中燃烧。他的一只手搭在左面山脊，青铜手指捏着一块巨岩；另一只手伸向天空，抓着一把断剑的剑柄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound was as huge as he was, a terrible groaning and grinding, so loud it drowned out even the captain's voice and the crash of the waves against those pine-clad ridges. A thousand seabirds took to the air at once, and Arya flinched until she saw that Denyo was laughing. "He warns the Arsenal of our coming, that is all," he shouted. "You must not be afraid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洪亮的声音跟他的个头相称，骇人的轰鸣甚至淹没了船长的嗓门和波涛拍击松林山脉的声响。成千只海鸟同时蹿入空中，艾莉亚向后畏缩，直到她看见德尼奥在笑。“他把我们到来的消息通知兵工厂，”男孩喊道，“你不必害怕。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He is only a little bigger than King Baelor's statue in King's Landing, she told herself when they were still well off to sea. As the galleas drove closer to where the breakers smashed against the ridgeline, however, the Titan grew larger still. She could hear Denyo's father bellowing commands in his deep voice, and up in the rigging men were bringing in the sails. We are going to row beneath the Titan's legs. Arya could see the arrow slits in the great bronze breastplate, and stains and speckles on the Titan's arms and shoulders where the seabirds nested. Her neck craned upward. Baelor the Blessed would not reach his knee. He could step right over the walls of Winterfell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不过比君临的贝勒王雕像大一点点嘛，她告诉自己，然而那时船只仍在远海。当三桅大帆船逐渐靠近海浪拍打的山脊，泰坦的身躯便愈加骇人。德尼奥的父亲用低沉的嗓音大声指挥，人们继续在索具上忙碌。我们要从泰坦的双腿底下划过去。艾莉娅可以看到巨大胸甲上无数的箭孔，也可以看到泰坦的双臂和肩膀沾满斑斑点点的污渍，那全是海鸟的巢穴。她曲项仰望。受神祝福的贝勒还不及他的膝盖，他抬腿就能跨越临冬城的城墙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, she kept one hand on Needle as they slipped between his legs. More arrow slits dotted the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned her neck around to watch the crow's nest slip through with a good ten yards to spare, she spied murder holes beneath the Titan's armored skirts, and pale faces staring down at them from behind the iron bars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便如此，驶过他双腿底下时，她仍一手摸向缝衣针。巨岩大腿的内侧点缀着更多箭孔，艾莉亚仰起脖子，发现那些箭孔比头顶的鸦巢仍有足足十码，泰坦的战裙底下也有杀人孔，苍白的脸在铁栏杆后面注视着他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wind and wave had the Titan's Daughter hard in hand now, driving her swiftly toward the channel. Her double bank of oars stroked smoothly, lashing the sea to white foam as the Titan's shadow fell upon them. For a moment it seemed as though they must surely smash up against the stones beneath his legs. Huddled by Denyo at the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had touched her face. She had to look straight up to see the Titan's head. "The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls," she heard Old Nan say again, but she was not a little girl, and she would not be frightened of a stupid statue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风浪全力驱动着泰坦之女号，将她快速推向地峡。双层桨叶平稳划动，海水被搅拌成白色泡沫，而泰坦的影子遮天蔽日。有那么一瞬间，他们似乎就要在他脚下的岩石上撞得粉身碎骨。艾莉亚跟德尼奥一起挤在船头，海水飞溅脸庞，味道咸涩。她必须高高昂头，方能看见泰坦的脑袋。“布拉佛斯人喂贵族小女孩给它吃，因为她们的肉粉嫩多汁。”她仿佛又听见老奶妈的话语，但她不是小女孩，也不会被一座笨雕像吓到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two galleys had come out to meet them. They seemed to skim upon the water like dragonflies, their pale oars flashing. Arya heard the captain shouting to them and their own captains shouting back, but she did not understand the words. A great horn sounded. The galleys passed to either side of them, so close that she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within their purple hulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两艘划桨船迎上前来，仿佛水面滑翔的蜻蜒，白色船桨上下翻飞。艾莉亚听见某位船长朝他们喊叫，然后泰坦之女号的船长大声应答，她听不懂这些话。随着一声嘹亮号角，两艘划桨船分向两侧，距离如此接近，她甚至能听到紫色船壳内的鼓点，砰、砰、砰、砰、砰、砰、砰、砰，就像活生生的心脏在跳动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shadow lifted, the pine-clad ridges fell away to either side, the winds dwindled, and they found themselves moving through a great lagoon. Ahead rose another sea mont, a knob of rock that pushed up from the water like a spiked fist, its stony battlements bristling with scorpions, spitfires, and trebuchets. "The Arsenal of Braavos," Denyo named it, as proud as if he'd built it. "They can build a war galley there in a day." Arya could see dozens of galleys tied up at quays and perched on launching slips. The painted prows of others poked from innumerable wooden sheds along the stony shores, like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and hungry, waiting for a hunter's horn to call them forth. She tried to count them, but there were too many, and more docks and sheds and quays where the shoreline curved away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="影子消失，两侧的松林山脊渐渐远去，风势减弱，船只驶入一个大礁湖中。前方又升起一座海礁，仿佛突出水中、长满尖刺的拳头，顶端的岩石垛口上密密麻麻布满投石机、弩炮与喷火弩。“这便是布拉佛斯的兵工厂，”德尼奥的口气好像是他造的一样，“在那里，一天就能建造一艘战舰。”艾莉亚看到数十艘划桨战船泊在码头边或者架在下水槽中，另有许多绘漆的船首像从岩石岸边无数个木头工棚中冒出来，仿佛关在兽舍中的猎狗，精悍、凶狠而饥饿，随时等待猎人号角的召唤。她试图记点数目，但它们实在太多，而且随着海岸线蜿蜒伸展，还有更多码头、工棚与船坞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The deck creaked behind them. Arya turned to find Denyo's father looming over them in his long captain's coat of purple wool. Tradesman-Captain Ternesio Terys wore no whiskers and kept his grey hair cut short and neat, framing his square, windburnt face. On the crossing she had oft seen him jesting with his crew, but when he frowned men ran from him as if before a storm. He was frowning now. "Our voyage is at an end," he told Arya.

<div class="line_en">Maester Luwin had taught them about Braavos, but Arya had forgotten much of what he'd said. It was a flat city, she could see that even from afar, not like King's Landing on its three high hills. The only hills here were the ones that men had raised of brick and granite, bronze and marble. Something else was missing as well, though it took her a few moments to realize what it was. The city has no walls. But when she said as much to Denyo, he laughed at her. "Our walls are made of wood and painted purple," he told her. "Our galleys are our walls. We need no other."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Titan's Daughter dwindled in their wake, while the city grew larger with every stroke of Yorko's oars. A harbor was visible off to her right, a tangle of piers and quays crowded with big-bellied whalers out of Ibben, swan ships from the Summer Isles, and more galleys than a girl could count. Another harbor, more distant, was off to her left, beyond a sinking point of land where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust themselves above the water. Arya had never seen so many big buildings all together in one place. King's Landing had the Red Keep and the Great Sept of Baelor and the Dragonpit, but Braavos seemed to boast a score of temples and towers and palaces that were as large or even larger. I will be a mouse again, she thought glumly, the way I was in Harrenhal before I ran away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yorko swung them north of the docks and down the gullet of a great canal, a broad green waterway that ran straight into the heart of the city. They passed under the arches of a carved stone bridge, decorated with half a hundred kinds of fish and crabs and squids. A second bridge appeared ahead, this one carved in lacy leafy vines, and beyond that a third, gazing down on them from a thousand painted eyes. The mouths of lesser canals opened to either side, and others still smaller off of those. Some of the houses were built above the waterways, she saw, turning the canals into a sort of tunnel. Slender boats slid in and out among them, wrought in the shapes of water serpents with painted heads and upraised tails. Those were not rowed but poled, she saw, by men who stood at their sterns in cloaks of grey and brown and deep moss green. She saw huge flat-bottomed barges too, heaped high with crates and barrels and pushed along by twenty polemen to a side, and fancy floating houses with lanterns of colored glass, velvet drapes, and brazen figureheads. Off in the far distance, looming above canals and houses both, was a massive grey stone roadway of some kind, supported by three tiers of mighty arches marching away south into the haze. "What's that?" Arya asked Yorko, pointing. "The sweetwater river," he told her. "It brings fresh water from the mainland, across the mudflats and the briny shallows. Good sweet water for the fountains."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约寇划向港口以北，深入一条大运河，这条宽阔的绿色水道笔直地延伸至城市中心。他们从一座精雕细刻的石拱桥下经过，桥上雕饰着数十种不同的鱼、螃蟹和乌贼；第二座桥雕有枝繁叶茂的蔓藤；后面又有第三座，上千只彩绘眼睛向下凝视着他们。运河两侧有一些较小的水渠汇入，更小的支流则汇入它们。有些房子居然建在运河上方，使得运河成为某种隧道。水蛇形状的细窄小船在隧道中进进出出，它们有彩绘船头和高翘尾巴，而且是不用划的，由人站在船尾拿篙子撑，撑船人身穿灰色、褐色或苔藓般深绿的斗篷。此外，她看见平底驳船，上面高高地堆满箱子和木桶，船两边各有二十个篙夫；还有奇特的浮屋，挂着彩色玻璃吊灯，饰有天鹅绒帘幕和黄铜船首像。远处的沟渠和房屋上方，隐约可见一条硕大的灰岩管道，由三层结实的桥弓支撑，伸向南方的迷雾之中。“那是什么？”艾莉亚指着问约寇。“那是甜水渠，”他告诉她，“它跨越泥沼和浅滩，输入淡水，最终这些优质的甜水会注进喷泉池中。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The city had seemed like one big island from where the Titan stood, but as Yorko rowed them closer she saw that it was many small islands close together, linked by arched stone bridges that spanned innumerable canals. Beyond the harbor she glimpsed streets of grey stone houses, built so close they leaned one upon the other. To Arya's eyes they were queer-looking, four and five stories tall and very skinny, with sharp-peaked tile roofs like pointed hats. She saw no thatch, and only a few timbered houses of the sort she knew in Westeros. They have no trees, she realized. Braavos is all stone, a grey city in a green sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从泰坦巨人矗立的地方看过来，整座城市似乎是个大岛，但随着约寇将她划近，她发现布拉佛斯确实由许多小岛聚合而成，石拱桥跨越若干水道，将它们连接在一起。越过港口，灰色石屋排列成街巷，房子建得极为紧密，彼此倚靠。在艾莉亚看来，它们的模样十分古怪，各有四五层楼，却细瘦得很，覆盖瓦片的陡峭屋顶就像尖顶帽——她没见到茅草屋顶，熟悉的维斯特洛式木屋也寥寥可数。木材好少啊，她意识到，布拉佛斯是个石头城，绿色汪洋中的灰色城市。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she looked behind her, the harbor and lagoon were lost to sight. Ahead, a row of mighty statues stood along both sides of the channel, solemn stone men in long bronze robes, spattered with the droppings of the seabirds. Some held books, some daggers, some hammers. One clutched a golden star in his upraised hand. Another was upending a stone flagon to send an endless stream of water splashing down into the canal. "Are they gods?" asked Arya.</div>

More shrines loomed up to either side.</div>

Suddenly she was somewhere else… back in Harrenhal with Gendry, maybe, or with the Hound in the woods along the Trident. Salty is a stupid child, she told herself.

In their center was a carved moon face; ebony on the weirwood side, weirwood on the ebony. The look of it reminded her somehow of the heart tree in the godswood at Winterfell. The doors are watching me, she thought. She pushed upon both doors at once with the flat of her gloved hands, but neither one would budge. Locked and barred. "Let me in, you stupid," she said.

<div class="line_en">Slowly her eyes adjusted. The temple seemed much larger within than it had without. The septs of Westeros were seven-sided, with seven altars for the seven gods, but here there were more gods than seven. Statues of them stood along the walls, massive and threatening. Around their feet red candles flickered, as dim as distant stars. The nearest was a marble woman twelve feet tall. Real tears were trickling from her eyes, to fill the bowl she cradled in her arms. Beyond her was a man with a lion's head seated on a throne, carved of ebony. On the other side of the doors, a huge horse of bronze and iron reared up on two great legs. Farther on she could make out a great stone face, a pale infant with a sword, a shaggy black goat the size of an aurochs, a hooded man leaning on a staff. The rest were only looming shapes to her, half-seen through the gloom. Between the gods were hidden alcoves thick with shadows, with here and there a candle burning.</div>

The floor was made of stone, her feet told her; not polished marble like the floor of the Great Sept of Baelor, but something rougher. She passed some women whispering together. The air was warm and heavy, so heavy that she yawned. She could smell the candles. The scent was unfamiliar, and she put it down to some queer incense, but as she got deeper into the temple, they seemed to smell of snow and pine needles and hot stew. Good smells, Arya told herself, and felt a little braver. Brave enough to slip Needle back into its sheath.</div>

When he drew his fingers back he sucked them, one by one. He must be thirsty. There were stone cups along the rim of the pool. Arya filled one and brought it to him, so he could drink.

He lurched unsteadily toward the wall and crawled into an alcove onto a hard stone bed. When Arya peered around, she saw other alcoves too. On some there were old people sleeping.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya spun away, but it was only a little girl: a pale little girl in a cowled robe that seemed to engulf her, black on the right side and white on the left. Beneath the cowl was a gaunt and bony face, hollow cheeks, and dark eyes that looked as big as saucers. "Don't grab me," Arya warned the waif. "I killed the boy who grabbed me last."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚立即转身，但那不过是个小女孩，面色苍白，身穿大得不成比例的兜帽长袍，袍子右半黑，左半白。兜帽下的脸憔悴削瘦，脸颊凹陷，黑眼睛看上去跟茶碗一般大。“别抓着我，”艾莉亚警告这流浪儿，“上次我把那个抓我的男孩给杀了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya did not like the way they kept surprising her. The hooded man was tall, enveloped in a larger version of the black-and-white robe the girl was wearing. Beneath his cowl all she could see was the faint red glitter of candlelight reflecting off his eyes. "What place is this?" she asked him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚不喜欢别人老是这样让她吃惊。这回是个戴兜帽的男人，个子很高，身上裹着跟那女孩一样的黑白长袍，不过尺寸更大。从兜帽底下，她只能看见他眼睛反射出的微微泛红的烛光。“这是什么地方？”她问他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我没听过这个名字。”她的心沉下去。“他来自罗拉斯，头发半红半白。他答应教我秘密，还给了我这个。”铁硬币捏在拳头里，她松开手指，发现其已吸附在汗津津的掌心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let us see." The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. "Kiss me, child," he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.</div>
