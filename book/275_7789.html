<div class="line_en">The king promised a large reward to anyone who could free the land from this plague, but the beast was so large and strong that no one dared to go near the woods where it lived. Finally the king proclaimed that whoever could capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter in marriage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now in this country there lived two brothers, sons of a poor man. They declared that they dared to attempt the task. The older one, who was crafty and shrewd, did so out of pride. The younger one, who was innocent and simple, did so because of his kind heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emerging from the other side of the woods, he came to a house where people were making merry drinking wine and dancing. His older brother was there too. Thinking that the boar would not run away from him any time soon, he had decided to drink himself some real courage. When he saw his younger brother coming out of the woods with his booty, his envious and evil heart gave him no peace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="森林另一端的入口处有座房子，人们在那里饮酒、跳舞作乐。弟弟来到那儿时，哥哥早已坐在里面了，他以为野猪反正逃不出他的手心，于是先喝点酒壮胆。当他看到弟弟带着战利品从森林里返回时，邪恶的心里充满了嫉妒，无法平息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After many long years a shepherd was driving his herd across the bridge and saw a little snow-white bone lying in the sand below. Thinking that it would make a good mouthpiece, he climbed down, picked it up, and then carved out of it a mouthpiece for his horn. When he blew into it for the first time, to his great astonishment the bone began to sing by itself:</div>
