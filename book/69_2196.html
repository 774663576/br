<div class="line_en">It wasn't Lyra's way to brood; she was a sanguine and practical child, and besides, she wasn't imaginative. No one with much imagination would have thought seriously that it was possible to come all this way and rescue her friend Roger; or, having thought it, an imaginative child would immediately have come up with several ways in which it was impossible. Being a practiced liar doesn't mean you have a powerful imagination. Many good liars have no imagination at all; it's that which gives their lies such wide-eyed conviction.</div>

<div class="line_en">So now that she was in the hands of the Oblation Board, Lyra didn't fret herself into terror about what had happened to the gyptians. They were all good fighters, and even though Pantalaimon said he'd seen John Faa shot, he might have been mistaken; or if he wasn't mistaken, John Faa might not have been seriously hurt. It had been bad luck that she'd fallen into the hands of the Samoyeds, but the gyptians would be along soon to rescue her, and if they couldn't manage it, nothing would stop lorek Byrnison from getting her out; and then they'd fly to Svalbard in Lee Scoresby's balloon and rescue Lord Asriel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在既然已经落入到祭祀委员会的手里，莱拉便不让自己为吉卜赛人的命运提心吊胆了，因为他们全都英勇善战。虽然潘特莱蒙说他看见约翰·法阿被射中了，但说不定是他搞错了；或者就算他没弄错，约翰·法阿也许伤得并不重。落到萨莫耶德人的手里是够倒霉的了，但吉卜赛人不久就会来救她；如果他们办不到，那么埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松也会来救她，这是谁也挡不住的；然后，他们会坐上李·斯科尔斯比的气球，飞到斯瓦尔巴特群岛，去救阿斯里尔勋爵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was sitting with five other boys at a table just inside the door. The line for the hatch went right past them, and she was able to pretend to drop a handkerchief and crouch to pick it up, bending low next to his chair, so that Pantalaimon could speak to Roger's daemon Salcilia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他跟另外五个男孩坐在刚进门的一张桌子那儿，排队去窗口取饭的人正好经过他们身边。莱拉就可以假装把手绢掉在地上，蹲下身子去捡，在罗杰的椅子边深深地弯着腰，这样，潘特莱蒙就能跟罗杰的精灵塞尔西里亚说上话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was a chaffinch, and she fluttered so wildly that Pantalaimon had to be a cat and leap at her, pinning her down to whisper. Such brisk fights or scuffles between children's daemons were common, luckily, and no one took much notice, but Roger went pale at once. Lyra had never seen anyone so white. He looked up at the blank haughty stare she gave him, and the color flooded back into his cheeks as he brimmed over with hope, excitement, and joy; and only Pantalaimon, shaking Salcilia firmly, was able to keep Roger from shouting out and leaping up to greet his best friend, his comrade in arms, his Lyra.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he saw how she looked away disdainfully, and he followed her example faithfully, as he'd done in a hundred Oxford battles and campaigns. No one must know, of course, because they were both in deadly danger. She rolled her eyes at her new friends, and they collected their trays of cornflakes and toast and sat together, an instant gang, excluding everyone else in order to gossip about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他发现，莱拉不屑地把目光挪到了别的地方，他便像过去在牛津上百场战斗和战役中那样，也原原本本地照着莱拉的样子，不再看她。他们俩正处在极端的危险之中，一定不能让任何人看出来。莱拉的眼睛翻动着，注意看她的几个新朋友，她们各自拿了装着玉米片和烤面包片的盘子，坐在一起，马上就形成了一个小集团，不让任何别的人参与进来，以便她们自己聊天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You can't keep a large group of children in one place for long without giving them plenty to do, and in some ways Bolvangar was run like a school, with timetabled activities such as gymnastics and "art." Boys and girls were kept separate except for breaks and mealtimes, so it wasn't until midmorning, after an hour and a half of sewing directed by one of the nurses, that Lyra had the chance to talk to Roger. But it had to look natural; that was the difficulty. All the children there were more or less at the same age, and it was the age when most boys talk to boys and girls to girls, each making a conspicuous point of ignoring the opposite sex.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你要是想把一大群孩子长时间地聚在一个地方，就必须让他们做很多事情。从某些方面来说，伯尔凡加的运作就像是一所学校，在时间表上的活动还有体操和“艺术”。除了课间休息和吃饭时间之外，男孩女孩都是分开的，因此，一个护士给她们上了一个半小时的缝纫课之后，当上午过去了一半的时候，莱拉才有机会跟罗杰说上话。但是难就难在他们见面得显得十分自然。这里的孩子年龄大致都差不多，大部分正处在男孩找男孩、女孩找女孩的年纪，对异性全都故意不理不睬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, I know why they took him," she said, as heads clustered close nearby. "It was because his daemon didn't change. They thought he was older than he looked, or summing, and he weren't really a young kid. But really his daemon never changed very often because Tony hisself never thought much about anything. I seen her change. She was called Ratter…"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the name of Tony Makarios. As Lyra's attention snapped toward that, Pantalaimon had to slow down his whispered conversation with Roger's daemon, and both children listened to what the girl was saying.</div>

<div class="line_en">She found her chance in the canteen again, when the children came in for a drink and a biscuit. Lyra sent Pantalaimon, as a fly, to talk to Salcilia on the wall next to their table while she and Roger kept quietly in their separate groups. It was difficult to talk while your daemon's attention was somewhere else, so Lyra pretended to look glum and rebellious as she sipped her milk with the other girls. Half her thoughts were with the tiny buzz of talk between the daemons, and she wasn't really listening, but at one point she heard another girl with bright blond hair say a name that made her sit up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉还是在餐厅找到了机会。当时，孩子们到餐厅找饮料、吃点心。她打发潘特莱蒙——这时他变成了一只苍蝇——去跟停在她们桌子旁边墙上的塞尔西里亚说话，她和罗杰则在各自的那一群孩子里保持着沉默——当你的精灵把注意力放在别的地方的时候，你是很难开口说话的。于是，莱拉便跟别的女孩小口喝着牛奶，装出闷闷不乐、桀骜不驯的样子。她的一半心思都放在那两个精灵之间细小的嗡嗡的交谈上，但她并没有真的在听。但是后来，她听到另一个长着明亮的金色头发的女孩提到了一个名字，她便一下子坐直了身子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of that morning was spent in exercise. There was a small gymnasium at the station, because it was hard to exercise outside during the long polar night, and each group of children took turns to play in there, under the supervision of a nurse. They had to form teams and throw balls around, and at first Lyra, who had never in her life played at anything like this, was at a loss what to do. But she was quick and athletic, and a natural leader, and soon found herself enjoying it. The shouts of the children, the shrieks and hoots of the daemons, filled the little gymnasium and soon banished fearful thoughts; which of course was exactly what the exercise was intended to do.</div>

It was easier to do this at lunchtime, when children spent more time coming and going between the tables and the counter, where bland-looking adults served equally bland food.

Billy had heard from a nurse that children who had had the operation were often taken to hostels further south, which might explain how Tony Makarios came to be wandering in the wild. But Roger had something even more interesting to tell her.</div>

"If they see broken glass and footprints in the snow, how long do you think your disguise will last? And it must hold out till the gyptians come.

When the footprints were covered, the goose turned to herd the pale daemons together. He spoke, and one by one they changed, though you could see the effort it cost them, until they were all birds; and like fledglings they followed the witch's daemon, fluttering and falling and running through the snow after him, and finally, with great difficulty, taking off. They rose in a ragged line, pale and spectral against the deep black sky, and slowly gained height, feeble and erratic though some of them were, and though others lost their will and fluttered downward; but the great gray goose wheeled round and nudged them back, herding them gently on until they were lost against the profound dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">The pilot cut the speed and began the complex Business of adjusting the height. Lyra realized what the stout mast was for: of course, it was a mooring mast.
