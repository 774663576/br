<div class="line_en">The abbé did not know Monte Cristo, but Dantès knew it. He had often sailed past this island, which lies twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and Elba; once he had even dropped anchor there. The island was, had always been and is still utterly deserted: it is a rock of almost conical shape, which appears to have been thrown up by some volcanic cataclysm from the depths to the surface of the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长老不知道基督山岛在什么地方，但邓蒂斯却知道，而且常常经过它，甚至还上去过一次，它离皮亚诺扎只有二十五哩路，在科西嘉和爱尔巴岛之间。这个岛以前一向是，而且现在还是荒无人居的地方。它几乎是一块圆椎形的大岩石，象是某一次火山爆发把它喷出到海面上来似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now that the treasure, which had been for so long the object of the abbé's meditations, might ensure the future happiness of the man whom Faria loved truly as a son, it doubled in worth in his eyes. Every day, he dwelt on the amount, explaining to Dantès how much a man could do nowadays, in the way of good to his friends, with a fortune of thirteen or fourteen millions. Then Dantès' face clouded, because he recalled the oath of vengeance that he had taken and he considered how much, nowadays, with a fortune of thirteen or fourteen millions, a man could do in the way of harm to his enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长时间以来，长老一直在把这个宝藏当作他沉思默想时的题目，现在，可以拿它来保证他确实爱如己子的邓蒂斯的未来的幸福了。于是，宝藏的价值在法利亚的眼中无形增加了一倍，他每天絮絮叨叨地谈论那笔数目，向邓蒂斯解释，在现在这个时代，一个人有了一千三百万或一千四百万，能如何如何地为他的友人造福。可是邓蒂斯的脸却阴沉起来，因为他的记忆里又现出了复仇的誓言，同时他想到，在现在这个时代，一个人有了一千三百万或一千四百万，对他的仇人能降多大的祸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès made a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès advice on the best way to recover the treasure. But Dantès was considerably less enthusiastic and above all less confident than the old man. Admittedly he was now quite certain that Faria was not mad, and the means by which he had arrived at the discovery that had made others believe him insane only added to Dantès' admiration for him. But he could also not believe that the cache, assuming that it had ever existed, existed still; and, while he did not consider the treasure as a chimera, he did at least think of it as absent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯把那个岛画了一张地图给法利亚看，而法利亚则为邓蒂斯设计他应该用什么方法去发现那宝藏。但邓蒂斯却远不如老人那样热情和有信心。不错，法利亚确实不是一个疯子，他的发现引起了人们对于他疯狂的怀疑，可是达到这种发现的艰苦经过现在更增加了邓蒂斯对他的崇拜。同时，即使那笔宝藏的确是有的，他也不能相信现在依旧还会存在，虽然他认为那宝藏决不是空中楼阁，可是他相信它已不在那儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see," the young man told Faria wistfully. "God wishes to deprive me even of the merit of what you call my devotion to you. I promised to stay with you for ever and I am no longer free to break my promise. I shall no more have the treasure than you will: neither one of us will leave this place. Moreover, my true treasure, my friend, is not the one that awaits me under the dark rocks of Monte Cristo, but your presence, and the time that we spend together for five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is those rays of understanding that you have shone into my brain and the languages that you have implanted in my memory and which now grow there, putting out further branches of language in their turn. The many sciences that you have brought within my grasp by the depth of your own knowledge of them and the clarity of the basic principles which you have derived from them -- this is my treasure, my friend, this is what you have given to make me rich and happy. Believe me, and console yourself; this is worth more to me than tons of gold and trunkloads of diamonds, even if they were not uncertain, like those clouds which can be seen in the morning above the sea and which appear to be dry land, but which evaporate, disperse and fade away as one approaches them. Having you close to me for as long as possible, hearing your eloquent voice as it enlightens my mind, re-tempering my soul, making my whole being capable of great and awe-inspiring deeds if ever I should be free, filling my mind and soul so thoroughly that the despair to which I was ready to give way when I met you can no longer find any place in them -- this is my fortune. It is not a chimera. I truly owe it to you, and all the sovereigns on earth, were they all Cesare Borgias, could not succeed in taking it away from me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看，”青年带着一种悲哀的，听天由命的神气对法利亚说，“你说我肯为你牺牲，但上帝认为这种赞誉我都不应该接受。我答应过永远和你在一起，现在即使我想破坏我的诺言，事实也不允许了。至于那宝藏，我和你都同样的拿不到，我们之中谁都不能离开这个监狱。但我真正的宝贝却并不是那个，我亲爱的朋友，并不是那在基督山阴森的岩石底下等待着我的那些东西，而是和你会面，——虽然有狱卒，我们每天仍有五六个钟头能生活在一起，是你那些智慧之光启发了我的头脑，你的话已种植在我的记忆里，会在那儿茁长，开花，结果。你教给了我各种科学，凭着你对它们深刻的认识，你把它们缩成许多明白易懂的原则，使我很容易的领会了它们，——这才是我的宝贝，我敬爱的朋友，就凭这一切，你已经使我富足和幸福了。相信我吧，宽心吧！在我，这是比成吨的黄金和成箱的钻石更有用，即使那些黄金和钻石或许并不是幻景，——并不是那种我们在早晨看到它浮在海面上，认为是陆地，而向它渐渐走近的时候就消灭了的海市蜃楼。能尽量和你长期接近，能听见你那雄辩的声音来丰富我的头脑，振作我的精神，使我的身心能在一旦获得自由的时候经受得起可怕的大事，能丰富我的心灵，使快要向绝望让步的我自从认识了你以后不再受它的摆布，——这才是我的财产，而且是确切不移的财产。这一切都是你赐给我的。世界上所有的帝王，即使是凯撒·布琪亚，也是无法从我这儿把它夺去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, as if destiny wanted to deprive the prisoners of their last hope and let them know that they were condemned to prison for life, a new misfortune struck. The gallery beside the sea, which had been crumbling for many years, was rebuilt, the stone courses were repaired and the hole that had already been half excavated by Dantès was filled with huge blocks of stone. Without the precautions that (as the reader will remember) had been suggested to Dantès by the abbé, the misfortune would have been greater still, because the attempted escape would have been discovered and they would certainly have been separated. In any case, a new door, stronger and more impenetrable than the rest, had been closed before them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使他相信那宝藏还在那儿，但命运象是决心要剥夺这两个囚徒的最后的一个机会，象是要使他们懂得他们已命中注定要被判为无期徒刑似的，一件新的不幸又降到了他们头上。靠海的那条走廊，本来已长久坍毁，现在忽然又重建起来。他们把它全部修过，用许多大石头填没了邓蒂斯填过了的洞。但要是没有采取这一着预防，——要记得，这是长老向邓蒂斯建议的，——则不幸还要更大，因为他们逃走的企图会被发觉，而他们一定会被隔离。现在，他们被闭在一道新的而且甚至更坚固的门里面了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the two unfortunates, these days, if not exactly happy, did at least speed past as quickly as those that followed. Faria, who had kept silent about the treasure for many years, now spoke incessantly about it. As he had predicted, he remained paralysed in the right arm and left leg, and had almost lost any hope of being able to enjoy the fortune himself, but he continually dreamed that his young companion might be freed, or escape, and would enjoy it for him. Fearing that the letter might be mislaid or lost one day, he obliged Dantès to learn it by heart; and, since the first day, Dantès had known it from the first word to the last. Then he destroyed the second half, convinced that if the first was found, no one would be able to understand its true meaning. Sometimes whole hours passed in which Faria gave Dantès instructions, to be carried out when he was free. And, once he was free, from the very day, hour, instant of his freedom, he must have no thought except that of somehow reaching Monte Cristo, remaining alone there under some pretext and, once there, once alone, trying to find the wonderful grottoes and searching the spot indicated in the letter: this, you may remember, was the furthest angle of the second opening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，这两个受难者在一起度过的日子，虽然不能算是幸福的日子，却也一天接一天很快的在消逝。法利亚关于那宝藏以前曾保持了这么长期的沉默，现在却不断地谈到它。果然不出他的预料，他的右臂和右腿依旧麻痹不能动，他自己已放弃了一切享受那宝藏的希望。但他不断地在为他的青年同伴考虑逃走的方法。他怕那张遗嘱说不定有一天会失落或失窃，所以强迫邓蒂斯把它记在心里，使他能够逐字背得出来。然后他把下一半毁掉，以保证即使上一半被人得去，也没有人能够猜透其中的真意。有时候，法利亚成点钟地指教邓蒂斯，——指教他在得到自由以后该如何如何。要是一旦获得自由，从获得自由的那一天，那一时，那一刻起，他应该只有一个念头，就是想方设法到基督山去。并用一种不会引起任何怀疑的借口独自留在那儿，一到了那儿，就得努力去找到那神奇的洞窟，在指定的地点去发掘，——要记得，那指定的地点是在第二个洞口最深的一个角落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One night Edmond woke up with a start, thinking he had heard a cry. He opened his eyes and tried to penetrate the darkness. He faintly heard his name; or, rather, a plaintive voice trying to speak his name. He rose up on his bed, sweat rising to his forehead, and listened. There was no doubt. The cry was coming from his friend's dungeon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天晚上，爱德蒙突然醒来，好象他听到有一个人在呼唤他。他睁开眼睛，尽力在黑暗中张望。他听到有人在喊他的名字，或更正确的说，是一种象呼喊他名字的凄婉的声音。他从床上起来，汗流浃背，听着。毫无疑问。喊声来自他朋友的地牢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the hours passed, if not quickly, at least bearably. Faria, as we said, had not recovered the use of his hand and foot, but his mind was perfectly clear and, apart from the moral precepts which we have mentioned, he had taught his young companion the patient and noble craft of the prisoner, which is to make something out of nothing. So they were constantly occupied, Faria to ward off old age, Dantès in order to forget a past that was now almost extinct, and which only hovered in the furthest depths of his memory like a distant light flickering in the darkness. So time passed, as it does for those lives which have remained untroubled by misfortune and which continue calmly and mechanically under the eye of Providence. But beneath this calm surface, in the young man's heart, and also perhaps in that of the older one, there were many suppressed emotions and stifled sighs, which emerged when Faria was alone and Edmond had gone back to his own cell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这期间，时间的消逝即使不能算很快，但至少总还算可以忍受。我们已经说过，法利亚的手脚虽不能恢复活动，但头脑已完全清醒，理解力也已全部恢复，除了我们已详述过的那种为人处世的种种指示以外，他还逐渐地教导他的青年同伴，教他一个囚徒应该怎样的忍耐和高尚，怎样去学习从无所事事中找些事情来做。所以他们是永远有事情做的，——法利亚借此来忘却他自己的逐渐衰老；邓蒂斯则借此避免去回想那以前曾一度几乎熄灭，而现在却象黑夜里漂荡在远处的一盏明灯那样浮动在他记忆里的往事。所以日子平平静静地度了过去，就象过着那种没有灾祸来打扰，只是在苍天的庇佑之下机械地，宁静地溜过去的日子一样。在那青年人的心里，或许那老人的心里也一样吧，在这种表面的宁静之下，却藏着许多抑制了的愿望，许多忍住了的叹息，这些愿望和叹息，当法利亚只剩下独自一个人，当爱德蒙回到他自己的地牢里的时候，都一齐奔放了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

It would take you years by yourself to do alone all that I have done here, and it would be destroyed at once if our warders learned about the meetings between us. In any case, be calm, dear friend. The dungeon that I leave will not remain empty for long: some other unfortunate will come to take my place. This other man will look on you as a guardian angel. He may be young, strong and patient like yourself, he may help you in your escape, while I would only hinder you. You will no longer have half a corpse tied to you, impeding all your movements. Decidedly, God is at last doing something for you: he is giving you more than he is taking away. It is time I was dead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别作声！”他说，“不然你就完了。现在就顾你自己吧，——使你的狱中生活过得好一点，使自己还可以逃走。要重做我在这儿完成的工作，得花几年功夫呢，假如我们的狱卒知道我们能互相走来走去，那就马上会毁了的。放心吧，我亲爱的爱德蒙，我就要离开的这间黑牢，是不会长期空着的，另一个受难人不久就会来接替我的位置，他将把你看作是一个解放的天使。或许他也年轻，强壮，能刻苦耐劳，就象你一样，他能帮助你一起逃走，而我却只能阻碍你。你可以不再有一个半死的身体绑在你的身上，使你一动都不能动。上帝终于为你做了一些事，他的赐予超过了你被剥夺的一切，而这也是我该死的时候了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
