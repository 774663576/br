<div class="line_en">During the first part of the journey Aslan explained to Peter his plan of campaign. "As soon as she has finished her business in these parts," he said, "the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her House and prepare for a siege. You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it." He then went on to outline two plans of battle -- one for fighting the Witch and her people in the wood and another for assaulting her castle. And all the time he was advising Peter how to conduct the operations, saying things like, "You must put your Centaurs in such and such a place" or "You must post scouts to see that she doesn't do so-and-so," till at last Peter said,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅途中开头一段时间，阿斯兰向彼得说明它的作战计划。“妖婆一旦完成她在这一带的活动，”它说，“她同那一伙几乎肯定要退回她的老窝准备一次围攻。你有可能切断她的路．不让她回到老窝，也有可能切不断。”随后它继续提出两种作战方案——一种是跟妖婆及其一伙在树林里作战，另一种是袭击她的城堡。在这段时间里它一直指点彼得怎么指挥战斗，说什么，“你必须把你的人头马布置在某某地方”，或者说“你必须派侦察员去看好她，不要让她怎么怎么的”，彼得最后问：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aslan's mood affected everyone that evening. Peter was feeling uncomfortable too at the idea of fighting the battle on his own; the news that Aslan might not be there had come as a great shock to him. Supper that evening was a quiet meal. Everyone felt how different it had been last night or even that morning. It was as if the good times, having just begun, were already drawing to their end.</div>

The moonlight was bright and everything was quite still except for the noise of the river chattering over the stones. Then Susan suddenly caught Lucy's arm and said, "Look!" On the far side of the camping ground, just where the trees began, they saw the Lion slowly walking away from them into the wood. Without a word they both followed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个女孩悄没声儿，在其他睡着的人中摸索出一条路，偷偷出了帐篷。月光皎洁，除了河水潺潺流过石头的声音，一切都十分寂静。这时苏珊突然抓住露茜的胳膊说，“瞧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He led them up the steep slope out of the river valley and then slightly to the right -- apparently by the very same route which they had used that afternoon in coming from the Hill of the Stone Table. On and on he led them, into dark shadows and out into pale moonlight, getting their feet wet with the heavy dew. He looked somehow different from the Aslan they knew. His tail and his head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were very, very tired. Then, when they were crossing a wide open place where there where no shadows for them to hide in, he stopped and looked round. It was no good trying to run away so they came towards him. When they were closer he said,</div>

Four Hags, grinning and leering, yet also (at first) hanging back and half afraid of what they had to do, had approached him. "Bind him, I say!" repeated the White Witch. The Hags made a dart at him and shrieked with triumph when they found that he made no resistance at all. Then others -- evil dwarfs and apes -- rushed in to help them, and between them they rolled the huge Lion over on his back and tied all his four paws together, shouting and cheering as if they had done something brave, though, had the Lion chosen, one of those paws could have been the death of them all.

Those who had been afraid to come near him even after he was bound began to find their courage, and for a few minutes the two girls could not even see him -- so thickly was he surrounded by the whole crowd of creatures kicking him, hitting him, spitting on him, jeering at him.</div>
