<div class="line_cn" title="最初和她在一块儿，他过着一种令人难于相信的幸福生活。她用一种那般巧妙的经济手腕治家，两个人好像过得很阔气。她对待丈夫的注意，细心，体贴，真是罕有的；并且她本身的诱惑力非常之大，以至于在他俩相遇6年之后，他之爱她更甚于初期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her friends (the wives of some petty officials) frequently procured for her a box at the theatre, often for the first representations of the new plays; and her husband was obliged to accompany her, whether he wished it or not, to these entertainments which bored him excessively after his day's work at the office.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, with her love for the theatre, came also the desire for ornaments. Her costumes remained as before, simple, in good taste, and always modest; but she soon began to adorn her ears with huge rhinestones, which glittered and sparkled like real diamonds. Around her neck she wore strings of false pearls, on her arms bracelets of imitation gold, and combs set with glass jewels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁知这种看戏的兴趣，不久就在她身上产生了装饰的需要。她的服装固然始终是简单的，真是具有风雅的趣味的，不过究竟朴素；而她的幽娴的媚态，她的不可抵抗的、谦逊的和微笑的媚态，仿佛由于她那些裙袍上的简洁获得一种新的丰姿，但是她养成了习惯，爱给自己挂上一双假充金刚钻的大颗儿莱茵石的耳环，并且佩上人造珍珠的项圈，人造黄金的镯子，嵌着冒充宝石的五彩玻璃片儿的押发圆梳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her husband frequently remonstrated with her, saying: "My dear, as you cannot afford to buy real jewelry, you ought to appear adorned with your beauty and modesty alone, which are the rarest ornaments of your sex."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, of an evening, when they were enjoying a tete-a-tote by the fireside, she would place on the tea table the morocco leather box containing the "trash," as Monsieur Lantin called it. She would examine the false gems with a passionate attention, as though they imparted some deep and secret joy; and she often persisted in passing a necklace around her husband's neck, and, laughing heartily, would exclaim: "How droll you look!" Then she would throw herself into his arms, and kiss him affectionately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="偶尔到晚上，他俩坐在火炉角儿上相伴的时候，她就在他俩喝茶的桌子上摆出她那只收藏郎丹先生所谓“劣货”的小羊皮匣子来；接着她用热烈的专心态度来着手细看那些人造的珠宝，俨然是玩味着什么秘密而深刻的享受；末了她固执地把一个软项圈绕在她丈夫的脖子上，随即不住地哈哈大笑起来，一面嚷着：“你的样子真滑稽！”后来扑到了他的怀里，并且兴奋过度地吻着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
