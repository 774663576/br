<div class="line_en">They rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gathering night. When at last they halted and dismounted, even Aragorn was stiff and weary. Gandalf only allowed them a few hours' rest. Legolas and Gimli slept, and Aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but Gandalf stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. All was silent, and there was no sign or sound of living thing. The night was barred with long clouds, fleeting on a chill wind, when they arose again. Under the cold moon they went on once more, as swift as by the light of day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hours passed and still they rode on. Gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat, if Gandalf had not clutched and shaken him. Hasufel and Arod, weary but proud, followed their tireless leader, a grey shadow before them hardly to be seen. The miles went by. The waxing moon sank into the cloudy West.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look!" he cried, and they lifted their tired eyes. Before them stood the mountains of the South: white-tipped and streaked with black. The grass-lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet, and flowed up into many valleys still dim and dark, untouched by the light of dawn, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains. Immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf among the hills. Far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one tall peak; at the mouth of the vale there stood like a sentinel a lonely height. About its feet there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that issued from the dale; upon its brow they caught, still far away, a glint in the rising sun, a glimmer of gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们看！”他大喊着。众人张开疲倦的双眼凝神望去，在他们眼前就是南方的大山，顶端沾染着白色的积雪，其中渗着一道道黑色的痕迹。草原一路延伸到山脚边，最后进入许多尚未被阳光照耀的山谷中，隐遁在这些崇山峻岭的中心地带。就在这些赶路人的眼前，这块广阔的草原像是山脉间的海湾一样开展，在远方的山中，他们依稀看见一座孤峰挺立在山谷的入口处，像是一名哨兵般坚守岗位。在那座山的山脚下有一道银光闪闪的河流，而靠近岸边，借着曙光，他们瞥见了一道金色的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Legolas gazed ahead, shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new-risen sun. "I see a white stream that comes down from the snows," he said. "Where it issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon the east. A dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it. Within there rise the roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there stands aloft a great hall of Men. And it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold. The light of it shines far over the land. Golden, too, are the posts of its doors. There men in bright mail stand; but all else within the courts are yet asleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="勒苟拉斯伸手遮住刺眼的曙光，定睛一看。“我看见一条积雪所融成的溪流，”他说：“它是从山谷中的阴影中一路流出，东边还有座翠绿的山丘，有道壕沟和带刺的围篱围住了该处。在那里似乎有许多的屋舍，在正中央的一块绿地上，有一座人类所建造的巨大殿堂，在我的眼中看起来，它似乎拥有黄金打造的屋顶，那光芒照耀着四周的城市，它的柱子和大门也都是金色的。宫殿附近还有许多穿着盔甲的人类守卫着，但其它的人都还在梦乡中。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Edoras those courts are called," said Gandalf, "and Meduseld is that golden hall. There dwells Théoden son of Thengel, King of the Mark of Rohan. We are come with the rising of the day. Now the road lies plain to see before us. But we must ride more warily; for war is abroad, and the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, do not sleep, even if it seem so from afar. Draw no weapon, speak no haughty word, I counsel you all, until we are come before Théoden's seat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这座城市叫作伊多拉斯，”甘道夫说：“那个黄金宫殿叫作梅杜西，洛汗国的骠骑军团统帅希优顿就居住在该处。我们和曙光一同到来，眼前的道路也十分清楚，但我们必须更谨慎地赶路，因为战火迫在眉睫；不管从远方看起来怎么样，这些牧马王随时都处在枕戈待旦的警戒状态。不要拿出武器，也不要冒犯对方，一切都等我们来到希优顿的王座之前再说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The morning was bright and clear about them, and birds were singing, when the travellers came to the stream. It ran down swiftly into the plain, and beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend, flowing away east to feed the Entwash far off in its reed-choked beds. The land was green: in the wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow-trees. Already in this southern land they were blushing red at their fingertips, feeling the approach of spring. Over the stream there was a ford between low banks much trampled by the passage of horses. The travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the uplands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当一行人来到河边时，晨光十分明亮，众鸟啁啾。湍急的河水一路流入平原上，在山脚下转了个大弯，往东流去，汇入杂草遍布的树沐河河床之上。大地一片翠绿，在沾满露珠的野草旁，河岸边生满了低垂的柳树。在这块南方的土地上，柳树的枝条已经开始泛红，可以感觉到春天脚步的靠近。在众多的柳树旁则是一个饱经马蹄践踏的渡口，四人渡过小溪，踏上一条通往较高地势的宽广道路上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look!" said Gandalf. "How fair are the bright eyes in the grass! Evermind they are called, simbelmynë in this land of Men, for they blossom in all the seasons of the year, and grow where dead men rest. Behold! we are come to the great barrows where the sires of Théoden sleep."</div>

Now they call this land their home, their own, and their speech is sundered from their northern kin." Then he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the Elf and Dwarf; yet they listened, for there was a strong music in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但对骠骑们来说，可是极为久远之前的事情了！”亚拉冈说：“这皇家的兴起都已经成为歌谣中记载的传说，确实的年代也消失在历史的迷雾当中。现在，他们将这里称作家园，语言也和北方的同胞有了区隔。”然后，他开始用一种矮人与精灵都没听过的语言吟唱一首歌谣，虽然两人不知其中的意义，但也被那特殊的旋律所吸引，集中精神倾听着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is the will of Théoden King that none should enter his gates, save those who know our tongue and are our friends," replied one of the guards. "None are welcome here in days of war but our own folk, and those that come from Mundburg in the land of Gondor. Who are you that come heedless over the plain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our own horses? Long have we kept guard here, and we have watched you from afar. Never have we seen other riders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is one of these that bear you. He is one of the Mearas, unless our eyes are cheated by some spell.

Up the green terrace went a stair of stone, high and broad, and on either side of the topmost step were stone-hewn seats. There sat other guards, with drawn swords laid upon their knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders; the sun was blazoned upon their green shields, their long corslets were burnished bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men.</div>

<div class="line_en">The guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hinges. The travellers entered. Inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill. The hall was long and wide and filled with shadows and half lights; mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof. But here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts from the eastern windows, high under the deep eaves. Through the louver in the roof, above the thin wisps of issuing smoke, the sky showed pale and blue. As their eyes changed, the travellers perceived that the floor was paved with stones of many hues; branching runes and strange devices intertwined beneath their feet. They saw now that the pillars were richly carved, gleaming dully with gold and half-seen colours. Many woven cloths were hung upon the walls, and over their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend, some dim with years, some darkling in the shade. But upon one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse. He was blowing a great horn, and his yellow hair was flying in the wind. The horse's head was lifted, and its nostrils were wide and red as it neighed, smelling battle afar. Foaming water, green and white, rushed and curled about its knees.</div>

At the far end of the house, beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors, was a dais with three steps; and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair. Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circlet set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a bright light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers. Behind his chair stood a woman clad in white. At his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face and heavy-lidded eyes.</div>

Few men would be left to guard your walls, if he had been allowed to rule. And even now we learn from Gondor that the Dark Lord is stirring in the East. Such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return. Why indeed should we welcome you, Master Stormcrow? Láthspell I name you, Ill-news; and ill news is an ill guest they say."

Then my lord bade you choose any horse that you would and be gone; and to the wonder of all you took Shadowfax in your insolence. My lord was sorely grieved; yet to some it seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not too great. I guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid rather than render it. Do you bring men? Do you bring horses, swords, spears? That I would call aid; that is our present need. But who are these that follow at your tail? Three ragged wanderers in grey, and you yourself the most beggar-like of the four!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman turned and went slowly into the house. As she passed the doors she turned and looked back. Grave and thoughtful was her glance, as she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes. Very fair was her face, and her long hair was like a river of gold. Slender and tall she was in her white robe girt with silver; but strong she seemed and stern as steel, a daughter of kings. Thus Aragorn for the first time in the full light of day beheld Éowyn, Lady of Rohan, and thought her fair, fair and cold, like a morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood. And she now was suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings, wise with many winters, greycloaked, hiding a power that yet she felt. For a moment still as stone she stood, then turning swiftly she was gone.</div>

Curtains of wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and to the west was still dark with thunder, and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that had come out of the East was receding, rolling away southward to the sea.

<div class="line_en">Gimli walked with Legolas, his axe on his shoulder. "Well, at last we set off!" he said. "Men need many words before deeds. My axe is restless in my hands. Though I doubt not that these Rohirrim are fell-handed when they come to it. Nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me. How shall I come to the battle? I wish I could walk and not bump like a sack at Gandalf's saddlebow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金雳扛着斧头，走在勒苟拉斯身边。“呼，我们终于出发了！”他说：“人类每次要做什么事情总是会说一大堆话，我的斧头都等得不耐烦了，不过，我并不怀疑这些洛汗人在战斗时的能力。真可惜他们习惯的作战方法和我不同，我要怎么和他们并肩作战？我希望可以用双脚走路，而不必像一袋行李似地在甘道夫的马鞍上弹来弹去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun.</div>
