<div class="line_en">What I will do if he decides to go down, I don't know. What I'll do if he sounds and dies I don't know. But I'll do something. There are plenty of things I can do. He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the northwest. This will kill him, the old man thought. He can't do this forever. But four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done. "I wish I had the boy," the old man said aloud. "I'm being towed by a fish and I'm the towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鱼很稳定地移动，老人和它在平静的水面上一起缓慢地移动着。其它几个鱼饵仍然在水中，但是已经无暇顾之了。「我真希望小男孩在我身边。」老人大声地说：「现在，我竟成了栓在绳子上的杆子一般，被这条鱼拖着走。如果我把线死死地固定住了的话，这条鱼准会把它给挣断。我必须使尽所有力量跟着它，才能在必要时放出线来。感谢上帝保佑，它是往前游，而不是往下沉。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was noon when I hooked him," he said. "And I have never seen him." He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我在中午钓到它，」他说，「直到现在，都还没有看过它呢？」他还没有钓到鱼之前，一直都将头上的草帽用力地往下压，使得他的额头现在像是被割过般的发疼。他的口也渴了，为了怕触动鱼线，他跪下来，尽量小心翼翼地将一只手伸向船头拿水瓶。他打开水瓶喝了点水，然后坐在船桅杆和帆座上，靠着船头休息，尽量叫自己不要去想什么，只要忍耐就是了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old man's sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hund down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一整夜鱼都没改变它的航道或航向。老人从观察星象就可以知道了。太阳下山之后空气变得很凉，老人的手臂、背脊，和他那一双老腿上的汗都干了，使他更觉冰冷。白天的时候他拿出了一个用来盖鱼饵箱的袋子，把它放在太阳下晒干。太阳下山后，他便把那个袋子围在脖子上绑着，让它垂披在背上，把袋子垫在横跨肩膀的鱼线下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sunsets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn't maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回头望了望，发现已经完全看不见陆地了。他想，这也没什么关系，哈瓦那那儿的光总会指引我进港的。离太阳下山还有两个小时，也许那鱼在太阳下山之前就会浮出水面了。如果没有的话，或许它会和月亮一起出现。而如果再不是的话，它大概就会和明天的太阳一起升起。我不常抽筋，而且感觉自己还很健壮，何况嘴里衔着鱼钩的是那条鱼哩。可是，能这样拖着渔船走的鱼，真是不可思议。它一定是把嘴巴闭得紧紧地，咬着钓上的铁线。真希望能看看它，只要一眼就行，好让我晓得到底是什么在与我作对。">查看中文翻译</div>
