<div class="line_en">It happened on a Thursday. It must have, because Mariam remembered that she had been restless and preoccupied that day, the way she was only on Thursdays, the day when Jalil visited her at the kolba. To pass the time until the moment that she would see him at last, crossing the knee-high grass in the clearing and waving, Mariam had climbed a chair and taken down her mother's Chinese tea set. The tea set was the sole relic that Mariam's mother, Nana, had of her own mother, who had died when Nana was two. Nana cherished each blue-and-white porcelain piece, the graceful curve of the pot's spout, the hand-painted finches and chrysanthemums, the dragon on the sugar bowl, meant to ward off evil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天是星期四。肯定是的，因为玛丽雅姆记得那天她坐立不安、心不在焉；她只有在星期四才会这样，星期四是扎里勒到泥屋来看望她的日子。等到终于见到扎里勒的时候，玛丽雅姆将会挥舞着手臂，跑过空地上那片齐膝高的杂草；而这一刻到来之前，为了消磨时间，她爬上一张椅子，搬下她母亲的中国茶具。玛丽雅姆的母亲叫娜娜，娜娜的母亲在她两岁的时候便去世了，只给她留下这么一套茶具。这套瓷器蓝白相间，每一件都让娜娜视若珍宝，她珍爱茶壶嘴美观的曲线，喜欢那手工绘制的云雀和菊花，还有糖碗上那条用来辟邪的神龙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was this last piece that slipped from Mariam's fingers, that fell to the wooden floorboards of the kolba and shattered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从玛丽雅姆手中掉落、在泥屋的木地板上摔得粉碎的，正是最后这件瓷器。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Nana saw the bowl, her face flushed red and her upper lip shivered, and her eyes, both the lazy one and the good, settled on Mariam in a flat, unblinking way. Nana looked so mad that Mariam feared the jinn would enter her mother's body again. But the jinn didn't come, not that time. Instead, Nana grabbed Mariam by the wrists, pulled her close, and, through gritted teeth, said, "You are a clumsy little harami. This is my reward for everything I've endured. An heirloom-breaking, clumsy little harami."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到糖碗，娜娜满脸涨得通红，上唇不停地抖动，那双一只暗淡、一只明亮的眼睛死死地、眨也不眨地瞪着玛丽雅姆。娜娜看上去十分生气，玛丽雅姆害怕妖怪会再次进入她母亲的身体。但妖怪没有来，这次没有。娜娜抓住玛丽雅姆的手腕，咬牙切齿地说：“你这个笨手笨脚的小哈拉米。这就是我忍受了一切得到的回报。一个打碎传家宝的、笨手笨脚的小哈拉米！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the time, Mariam did not understand. She did not know what this word harami -- bastard -- meant. Nor was she old enough to appreciate the injustice, to see that it is the creators of the harami who are culpable, not the harami, whose only sin is being born. Mariam did surmise, by the way Nana said the word, that it was an ugly, loathsome thing to be a harami, like an insect, like the scurrying cockroaches Nana was always cursing and sweeping out of the kolba.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时玛丽雅姆没有听懂。她不知道“哈拉米”——私生子——这个词是什么意思。她还小，不能理解它所包含的歧视，也并不明白可耻的是生下了哈拉米的那些人，而非哈拉米，他们惟一的罪行不过是诞生在这个人世。但由于娜娜说出这个词的口气，玛丽雅姆确实猜想到哈拉米是一种丑陋的、可恶的东西，就像虫子，就像娜娜总是咒骂着将它们扫出泥屋的、慌慌张张的蟑螂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, when she was older, Mariam did understand. It was the way Nana uttered the word -- not so much saying it as spitting it at her -- that made Mariam feel the full sting of it. She understood then what Nana meant, that a harami was an unwanted thing; that she, Mariam, was an illegitimate person who would never have legitimate claim to the things other people had, things such as love, family, home, acceptance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，玛丽雅姆长大了一些，总算明白了。娜娜说出这个词语的口气已经让玛丽雅姆觉得它特别伤人——更何况她还边说边吐口水。那时她才明白娜娜的意思；才懂得哈拉米是一种人们不想要的东西；才知道她，玛丽雅姆，是一个不被法律承认的人，永远不能合法地享受其他人所拥有的东西，诸如爱情、亲人、家庭、认可，等等。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jalil never called Mariam this name. Jalil said she was his little flower. He was fond of sitting her on his lap and telling her stories, like the time he told her that Herat, the city where Mariam was born, in 1959, had once been the cradle of Persian culture, the home of writers, painters, and Sufis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扎里勒从来没这样叫过玛丽雅姆。扎里勒说她是他的蓓蕾。他喜欢她坐在他的膝盖上，喜欢讲故事给她听，喜欢告诉玛丽雅姆说赫拉特[1]，也就是玛丽雅姆1959年出生的那座城市，一度是波斯文化的摇篮，也曾经是众多作家、画家和苏非主义者的家园。【注：[1]Heart，阿富汗西部城市。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jalil told her the story of Queen Gauhar Shad, who had raised the famous minarets as her loving ode to Herat back in the fifteenth century. He described to her the green wheat fields of Herat, the orchards, the vines pregnant with plump grapes, the city's crowded, vaulted bazaars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扎里勒跟她讲加瓦尔·沙德王后[2]的故事，他说15世纪的时候，她建造了许多著名的尖塔，当作是献给赫拉特的颂诗。他向她描绘赫拉特绿油油的麦田和果园，还有那藤蔓上结满果实的葡萄，城里带圆形拱顶的拥挤市场。【注：[2]Gauhar Shad（1378～1457），也作Gawar Shad或Gohar Shad，帖木儿汗国国王沙哈鲁之妻，兀鲁伯之母。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There is a pistachio tree," Jalil said one day, "and beneath it, Mariam jo, is buried none other than the great poet Jami." He leaned in and whispered, "Jami lived over five hundred years ago. He did. I took you there once, to the tree. You were little. You wouldn't remember."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那儿有一棵开心果树，”有一天扎里勒说，“在树下面，亲爱的玛丽雅姆，埋着的不是别人，正是伟大的诗人雅米[3]。”他身体前倾，低声说：“雅米生活在五百年前。真的。我带你去过那儿，去那棵树。那时你还很小。你不记得了。”【注：[3]Lahman Jami（1414～1492），拉赫曼·雅米，波斯诗人。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was true. Mariam didn't remember. And though she would live the first fifteen years of her life within walking distance of Herat, Mariam would never see this storied tree. She would never see the famous minarets up close, and she would never pick fruit from Herat's orchards or stroll in its fields of wheat. But whenever Jalil talked like this, Mariam would listen with enchantment. She would admire Jalil for his vast and worldly knowledge. She would quiver with pride to have a father who knew such things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是真的。玛丽雅姆不记得了。虽然她在一个步行便可以到达赫拉特的地方度过了生命中的十五个年头，玛丽雅姆将不会见到故事中的这棵树。她将不会走近参观那些著名的尖塔；她也将不会在赫拉特的果园拾果子或者在它的麦田里散步。但每逢扎里勒说起这些，玛丽雅姆总是听得很入迷。她会羡慕扎里勒的见多识广。她会为有一个知道这些事情的父亲而骄傲得直颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam would listen dutifully to this. She never dared say to Nana how much she disliked her talking this way about Jalil. The truth was that around Jalil, Mariam did not feel at all like a harami. For an hour or two every Thursday, when Jalil came to see her, all smiles and gifts and endearments, Mariam felt deserving of all the beauty and bounty that life had to give. And, for this, Mariam loved Jalil.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jalil had three wives and nine children, nine legitimate children, all of whom were strangers to Mariam. He was one of Herat's wealthiest men. He owned a cinema, which Mariam had never seen, but at her insistence Jalil had described it to her, and so she knew that the façade was made of blue-and-tan terra-cotta tiles, that it had private balcony seats and a trellised ceiling. Double swinging doors opened into a tiled lobby, where posters of Hindi films were encased in glass displays. On Tuesdays, Jalil said one day, kids got free ice cream at the concession stand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扎里勒有三个妻子和九个子女，九个合法的子女，对玛丽雅姆来说，他们全都是陌生人。他是赫拉特屈指可数的富人。他拥有一家电影院，玛丽雅姆从未见过，但在她的恳求下，扎里勒曾经向她描绘过它的形状，所以她知道电影院的正面是蓝色和棕色相间的陶土砖，还知道它有一些包厢座位和格子状的天花板。推开两扇摇摇摆摆的门，里面是贴着地砖的大厅，大厅里面有些玻璃橱柜，展示着各种印度电影的海报。有一天扎里勒说，每逢星期二，儿童观众可以在零食部得到免费的冰淇淋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In addition to the cinema, Jalil owned land in Karokh, land in Farah, three carpet stores, a clothing shop, and a black 1956 Buick Roadmaster. He was one of Herat's best-connected men, friend of the mayor and the provincial governor. He had a cook, a driver, and three housekeepers.</div>

<div class="line_en">When that happened, Nana said, the collective gasp of Jalil's family sucked the air out of Herat. His in-laws swore blood would flow. The wives demanded that he throw her out. Nana's own father, who was a lowly stone carver in the nearby village of Gul Daman, disowned her. Disgraced, he packed his things and boarded a bus to Iran, never to be seen or heard from again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当那件事发生之后，娜娜说，扎里勒的家人全都张大了口，把赫拉特的空气一吸而光。他的姻亲发誓不会善罢甘休。他的几个妻子命令他将她扔出去。娜娜自己的父亲生活在附近的古尔德曼村，是个地位低微的石匠。他觉得面目无光，和娜娜断绝了关系，打点行李，踏上一辆前往伊朗的客车。自那以后，娜娜再也没有见到他，也没有他的消息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sometimes," Nana said early one morning, as she was feeding the chickens outside the kolba, "I wish my father had had the stomach to sharpen one of his knives and do the honorable thing. It might have been better for me." She tossed another handful of seeds into the coop, paused, and looked at Mariam. "Better for you too, maybe. It would have spared you the grief of knowing that you are what you are. But he was a coward, my father. He didn't have the dil, the heart, for it."</div>
