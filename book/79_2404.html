<div class="line_en">It was November 29, three days after Thanksgiving. The last week had been a good one, the Thanksgiving dinner the best they'd ever had as a family. Wendy had cooked Dick Hallorann's turkey to a turn and they had all eaten to bursting without even coming close to demolishing the jolly bird. Jack had groaned that they would be eating turkey for the rest of the winter -- creamed turkey, turkey sandwiches, turkey and noodles, turkey surprise.</div>

<div class="line_en">On this sparkling afternoon the two of them were upstairs, and Danny knew that they had been making love. They were dozing now. They were happy, he knew. His mother was still a little bit afraid, but his father's attitude was strange. It was a feeling that he had done something that was very hard and had done it right. But Danny could not seem to see exactly what the something was. His father was guarding that carefully, even in his own mind. Was it possible, Danny wondered, to be glad you had done something and still be so ashamed of that something that you tried not to think of it? The question was a disturbing one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天，在这个阳光灿烂的下午，杰克和温迪在楼上，丹尼知道他们在做爱。现在他们已经睡着了。他知道，他们心情很好，他妈妈还是有点担心，但他爸爸的态度却很奇怪。那是一种他做成了一件棘手的事而且做得完全正确的感觉，可丹尼不太明白是什么事。他爸爸十分警惕甚至在他自己脑子里也不轻易流露出来。丹尼不明白，当一个人做了一件使自己感到十分羞愧的事而努力不去想它的时候，他会高兴吗？这个问题很烦人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”他漠然地回答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't think such a thing was possible… in a normal mind.

<div class="line_cn" title="他认为这不太可能…对一个思维正常的人来说。他对他父亲的心思最深入的探测只给他带来了一幅朦朦胧胧的图画，而且他两次这样做的时候，他爸爸都立即用吓人的目光狠狠地瞪着他，好像知道他在干什么似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He tramped out through the kitchen to the back door, then paused. He was tired of playing out back, and at this time of day the hotel's shadow would be cast over his play area. He didn't even like being in the Overlook's shadow. He decided he would put on his snowshoes and go down to the playground instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一身臃肿地来到厨房后门，没有立刻开门出去。他在后院已经玩腻了，而且，白天的这个时候，饭店的阴影就投在他玩的地方——他不愿待在饭店的阴影里。他决定穿上雪鞋到游乐场去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He pulled a chair over, stood on it, and got his parka and snow pants out of the ballroom closet, and then sat down on the chair to put them on. His boots were in the boot box and he pulled them on, his tongue creeping out into the corner of his mouth in concentration as he laced them and tied the rawhide into careful granny knots. He pulled on his mittens and his ski mask and was ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拖来一张椅子，站上去，从舞厅衣橱里取出自己的风雪衣和风雪裤，然后坐在椅子上穿上了。他又从鞋箱里取出他的靴子，蹬在脚上，专心地系着鞋带，打了一个易解不易松的“祖母结”，做这些的时候，他神情专注，连舌头都从嘴角伸出来了。戴上连指手套和滑雪面罩后，一切准备就绪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he was in the lobby, getting ready to go out. He went out a lot, taking his sled or wearing his snowshoes. He liked to get out of the hotel. When he was out in the sunshine, it seemed like a weight had slipped from his shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼现在在门厅里，正准备出去。他到户外的次数很多，有时带上雪橇，有时穿雪鞋。他喜欢到外面去，待在外面的阳光里，他便感到肩上卸去了一块重负似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dick Hallorann had told him to stay away from the topiary, but the thought of the hedge animals did not bother him much. They were buried under snowdrifts now, nothing showing but a vague hump that was the rabbit's head and the lions' tails. Sticking out of the snow the way they were, the tails looked more absurd than frightening.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he didn't have to rest on his way down to the playground because it was all downhill. Less than ten minutes after he struggled up and over the monstrous snow-dune that had drifted in on the Overlook's front porch he was standing with his mittened hand on the playground slide. He wasn't even breathing hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他去游乐场的路上没有必要歇脚，因为一路都是下坡。翻过堆在门廊前的大雪丘之后不到十分钟他就来到了游乐场，戴着连指手套的手扶在滑梯上，大气都没喘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny opened the back door and got his snowshoes from the milk platform. Five minutes later he was strapping them to his feet on the front porch. His daddy had told him that he (Danny) had the hang of using the snowshoes -- the lazy, shuffling stride, the twist of ankle that shook the powdery snow from the lacings just before the boot came back down -- and all that remained was for him to build up the necessary muscles in his thighs and calves and ankles. Danny found it at his ankles got tired the fastest. Snowshoeing was almost as hard on your ankles as skating, because you had to keep clearing the lacings. Every five minutes or so he had to stop with his legs spread and the snowshoes fat on the snow to rest them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼打开后门，从水泥台上取来了雪鞋。五分钟后，他已经在门廊上绑雪鞋了。爸爸说丹尼已经掌握了穿雪鞋走路的诀窍——慢慢地拖着步子走，扭动脚踝抖去鞋上的雪粉——剩下的就只等他大腿、小腿肚和脚踝强健起来。丹尼发现他脚踝最容易疲劳，在雪上行走差不多跟滑冰一样考验脚踝，因为你得不停地清理掉鞋面的积雪。每隔三五分钟他就得坐下来，伸直双腿，雪鞋平放在雪面上，让脚踝歇一歇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The playground seemed much nicer in the deep snow than it ever had during the autumn. It looked like a fairyland sculpture. The swing chains had been frozen in strange positions, the seats of the big kids' swings resting flush against the snow. The jungle gym was an ice-cave guarded by dripping icicle teeth. Only the chimneys of the play-Overlook stuck up over the snow (wish the other one was buried that way only not with us in it) and the tops of the cement rings protruded in two places like Eskimo igloos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="游乐场一片银妆素裹，看上去犹如童话世界一般，远比它秋天的任何时候都漂亮。秋千的铁链上结了冰，歪歪扭扭的，秋千板天衣无缝地嵌在雪面上。攀援游戏架挂满了獠牙般的冰柱。只有照饭店大楼的样子做的游戏室的烟囱突出在雪面上（但愿饭店大楼埋成这样的时候我们不在里面），水泥筒的顶部有两处突出在雪面上，像爱斯基摩人的冰屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There had been avalanches in the area and the notorious KGB agent Slobbo had killed his girlfriend with a poison dart, but somewhere near was the Russian antigravity machine. Perhaps at the end of this very tunnel. He drew his automatic and went along the concrete tunnel, his eyes wide and alert, his breath pluming out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny tramped over there, squatted, and began to dig. Before long he had uncovered the dark mouth of one of them and he slipped into the cold tunnel. In his mind he was Patrick McGoohan, the Secret Agent Man (they had shown the reruns of that program twice on the Burlington TV channel and his daddy never missed them; he would skip a party to stay home and watch "Secret Agent" or "The Avengers" and Danny had always watched with him), on the run from KGB agents in the mountains of Switzerland.</div>

<div class="line_en">His make-believe game collapsed around him and he was suddenly aware that he felt closed in and extremely nervous in this tight ring of cement. He could hear his breathing; it sounded dank and quick and hollow. He was under the snow, and hardly any light filtered down the hole he had dug to get in here. Suddenly he wanted to be out in the sunlight more than anything, suddenly he remembered his daddy and mommy were sleeping and didn't know there he was, that if the hole he dug caved in he would be trapped, and the Overlook didn't like him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他突然意识到自己被关在了这个狭窄的水泥管里，极度紧张之中，他假扮特工的兴致已经荡然无存。他能听到自己的呼吸声，阴湿、急促、空洞。他埋在积雪下，几乎没有光线从他掘出的洞口照进来。他迫不急待地想出去重见天日，他蓦然间想起了爸爸妈妈还在睡觉，他们不知道他在什么地方，要是他挖开的那个洞塌陷了，他就会被困在里面，再说，远望饭店不喜欢他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny got turned around with some difficulty and crawled back along the length of the concrete ring, his snowshoes clacking woodenly together behind him, his palms crackling in last fall's dead aspen leaves beneath him. He had just reached the end and the cold spill of light coming down from above when the snow did give in, a minor fall, but enough to powder his face and clog the opening he had wriggled down through and leave him in darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼费了点劲才转过身子，然后沿着水泥筒往回爬去，雪鞋在他后面碰得啪啪直响，秋天留下的干杨树叶在他手掌下沙沙作声。他刚刚爬到出口，刚刚看到外面射进来的冷冰冰的光线，这时，雪果然坍塌了，不多，但足以扑他一脸，也堵上了那个刚好能容他爬进来的口子。他立即陷入了一片黑暗之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The far end of the concrete ring was solidly blocked with snow. He tried digging through it and was amazed (and a little uneasy) to see how solid it was, almost like ice from the cold and the constant weight of more snow on top of it.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="可是，这样的事已经发生了。狂乱的脑子告诉他，这样的事已经发生了，他在黑暗中，他被关上了，这里跟冰箱一样冷。另外——（这里除了我，还有什么别的东西。）他倒抽一口凉气，屏住了呼吸。一阵令人昏昏欲睡的恐怖潜入了他周身的经脉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes. Yes. There was something in here with him, some awful thing the Overlook had saved for just such a chance as this. Maybe a huge spider that had burrowed down under the dead leaves, or a rat… or maybe the corpse of some little kid that had died here on the playground. Had that ever happened? Yes, he thought maybe it had. He thought of the woman in the tub. The blood and brains on the wall of the Presidential Sweet. Of some little kid, its head split open from a fall from the monkey bars or a swing, crawling after him in the dark, grinning, looking for one final playmate in its endless playground. Forever.

<div class="line_en">At any moment he would feel its cold hand close over his ankle -- That thought broke his paralysis.

Blue light filtered down from above and Danny thrust himself up at it like a diver coming out of deep water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个想法把他从麻木状态中唤醒了。他开始挖掘堵在洞口的松雪，一捧捧地把雪粉拨向两腿之间，就像狗刨骨头一样。蓝色的光线透进来了，丹尼像潜水员跃出深水那样把自己送了上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He scraped his back on the lip of the concrete ring. One of his snowshoes twisted behind the other. Snow spilled down inside his ski mask and into the collar of his parka.

<div class="line_en">Then he was out, his face was turned up to the sun, and he was crawling through the snow, crawling away from the half-buried cement ring, gasping harshly, his face almost comically white with powdered snow -- a living fright -- mask. He hobbled over to the jungle gym and sat down to readjust his snowshoes and get his breath. As he set them to rights and tightened the straps again, he never took his eyes from the hole at the end of the concrete ring. He waited to see if something would come out. Nothing did, and after three or four minutes, Danny's breathing began to slow down. Whatever it was, it couldn't stand the sunlight. It was cooped up down there, maybe only able to come out when it was dark… or when both ends of its circular prison were plugged with snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他终于爬出来了。他仰面对着太阳，又开始在雪地上爬起来，他得赶快离开半埋在积雪中的水泥管。他喘着粗气，脸上沾着雪粉，白得甚至有些滑稽——一副惊恐的活面具。他挣扎着来到攀援游戏架旁边，坐下来，准备调整调整雪鞋、喘喘气让呼吸平静下来。他手上干着活儿，眼睛一刻也不敢离开那个洞口。他想看看是否有什么东西会钻出来，没有。三四分钟后，丹尼的呼吸渐渐平缓下来。不管是什么东西，反正它不敢见阳光。它被囚禁在下面，也许只有天黑后才可以出来…或者在它的圆柱形监狱两端都被雪堵上的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

He stood up and stared back at the concrete ring, almost completely submerged in the snow, and what he saw at the end he had exited from froze his heart. There was a circular patch of darkness at the end of it, a fold of shadow that marked the hole he'd dug to get down inside. Now, in spite of the snow-dazzle, he thought he could see something there. Something moving. A hand. The waving hand of some desperately unhappy child, waving hand, pleading band, drowning hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪鞋的带子紧得不能再紧了。他站起来，回头盯着水泥管，他被自己看到的东西吓得心脏几乎停止了跳动。管口上笼罩着一团阴影，黑黢黢的。此时，尽管白雪耀眼，他想，他还是看见了什么东西。那东西在动，是一只手。一个极度悲伤的孩子在招呼，一只摆动的手，一只恳求的手，一只求救的手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From behind him, that soft Hump sound of falling snow came again. He turned around and the head of one of the hedge lions was sticking out of the snow now, snarling at him. It was closer than it should have been, almost up to the gate of the playground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他身后又传来了雪堆坍塌的闷响。他转身一看，一头狮子的脑袋已经从积雪里伸出来了，对他呲着牙咧着嘴。它从原来的位置上挪近了许多，差不多快到游乐场的大门边了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He began to walk out of the playground, taking the same roundabout course his father had taken on the day that the snow flew. He concentrated on operating the snowshoes. Slow, flat strides. Don't lift your foot too high or you'll lose your balance. Twist your ankle and spill the snow off the crisscrossed lacings. It seemed so slow. He reached the corner of the playground. The snow was drifted high here and he was able to step over the fence. He got halfway over and then almost fell flat when the snowshoe on his behind foot caught on one of the fence posts. He leaned on the outside edge of gravity, pinwheeling his arms, remembering how hard it was to get up once you fell down.</div>

<div class="line_en">From his right, that soft sound again, falling clumps of snow.

The dog had turned its head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他右边又传来了那种沉闷的响声，大块大块的雪纷纷崩塌。他望了一眼，看见另外两头狮子前爪以上都露出来了，并排站在约摸60步开外，凹陷的绿眼睛死死地盯着他。那条狗把头也扭了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

He struggled out of the snow and tried to get the snowshoes under him, heart hammering crazily now (Secret Agent Man remember you're the Secret Agent) and overbalanced backward. For a moment he lay there looking at the sky, thinking it would be simpler to just give up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪鞋绞在了一起，他向前扑倒在雪里，手臂徒劳地挥舞着。头罩里、颈子里、靴子的上半截都钻进了许多雪。他挣扎着爬起来，想重新站到雪鞋上，心脏咚咚地狂跳着。（特工，记住你是特工）他用力过猛，又往后倒去了。他在那里躺了一会儿，望着天空，心想还不如放弃努力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he thought of the thing in the concrete tunnel and knew he could not. He gained his feet and stared over at the topiary. All three lions were bunched together now, not forty feet away. The dog had ranged off to their left, as if to block Danny's retreat. They were bare of snow except for powdery ruffs around their necks and muzzles. They were all staring at him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny looked back over his shoulder and his hurried breathing caught for a moment and then hurried on even faster. The nearest lion was now only twenty feet behind, breasting through the snow like a dog paddling in a pond. The two others were to its right and left, pacing it. They were like an army platoon on patrol, the dog, still off to their left, the scout. The closest lion had its head down. The shoulders bunched powerfully above its neck. The tail was up, as if in the instant before he had turned to look it had been swishing back and forth, back and forth. He thought it looked like a great big housecat that was having a good time playing with a mouse before killing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼回头看去，急促的呼吸顿时停住了，接着更加急促起来。最前面那头狮子离他只有20英尺了，一路趟着雪，像在池塘里刨水的狗一样。另外两头一左一右跟着它，亦步亦趋，像一支巡逻队，狗仍然跟在它们的左后方担任警戒。前面那头狮子埋着头，肩膀威风凛凛地耸在脖子上，尾巴翘着，好像在他回头的那一刹那之前一直在嗖嗖地挥舞着。他想，它看上去像只巨大的家猫，它在咬死猎物之前要好好戏弄一翻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He began to walk again, trying to regain the easy rhythm he had practiced with his daddy. Little by little it began to come, but with the rhythm came an awareness of just how tired he was, how much his fear had exhausted him. The tendons of his thighs and calves and ankles were hot and trembly. Ahead he could see the Overlook, mockingly distant, seeming to stare at him with its many windows, as if this were some sort of contest in which it was mildly interested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又开始走起来，试图找到跟爸爸一起练习时的那种轻松的节奏。渐渐地，那种节奏回来了，但同时，他也意识到自己太累了，恐惧对他的消耗太大了。他的大腿、小腿肚和踝关节的筋腱在发烫、颤抖。他向前看去，饭店大楼嘲弄般地遥远，它睁着一排排眼睛——窗户——注视着他，好像在观看一场它颇感兴趣的比赛。">查看中文翻译</div>
