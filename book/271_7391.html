<div class="line_en">Bella's body, streaming with red, started to twitch, jerking around in Rosalie's arms like she was being electrocuted. All the while, her face was blank -- unconscious. It was the wild thrashing from inside the center of her body that moved her. As she convulsed, sharp snaps and cracks kept time with the spasms.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rosalie and Edward were frozen for the shortest half second, and then they broke. Rosalie whipped Bella's body into her arms, and, shouting so fast it was hard to separate the individual words, she and Edward shot up the staircase to the second floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗莎莉和爱德华愣了半秒钟，然后他们打破这僵局。罗莎莉把贝拉抱起来，飞快的喊着什么，她说的很快以致于很难吧每个词分开来。她和爱德华冲向通往第二层的楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The room I followed them to looked like an emergency ward set up in the middle of a library. The lights were brilliant and white.

Rosalie pinned Bella down, yanking and ripping her clothes out of the way, while Edward stabbed a syringe into her arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hand came down on Bella's stomach, and vivid red spouted out from where she pierced the skin. It was like a bucket being turned over, a faucet twisted to full. Bella jerked, but didn't scream. She was still choking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的手按在贝拉腹部，鲜艳的红色从她划破的皮肤下喷涌而出。那就像是倾倒过一个水桶，一个水龙头开到最大。贝拉猛地抽搐一下，但没有尖叫。她仍然透不过气来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I launched myself at Rosalie, jumping across the table without bothering to phase. As I hit her stone body, knocking her toward the door, I felt the scalpel in her hand stab deep into my left arm.

<div class="line_en">I used my grip on Rosalie's face to swing her body out so that I could land a solid kick in her gut; it was like kicking concrete. She flew into the door frame, buckling one side of it. The little speaker in her ear crackled into pieces. Then Alice was there, yanking her by the throat to get her into the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我紧抓着罗莎莉的脸，甩动她的躯体，这样我就能狠狠地给她的腹部来上一击；那简直像踢在水泥上一样。她飞过门槛，抓住了一边。她耳朵里的小小耳机在地上摔得粉碎。然后，爱丽丝过来了，卡住她的喉咙把她扔向大厅。">查看中文翻译</div>

The sound brought back the fight in the clearing so many months ago, the tearing sound of the newborns being ripped apart. I glanced over to see Edward's face pressed against the bulge.

<div class="line_cn" title="另一声震惊我的响动，突如其来，十分可怕。就像是金属碎成碎片。这声音带回已被遗忘的几个月前的战争，这是新生儿带来的撕裂什么东西的声音。我看到爱德华的脸贴在隆起的腹部。吸血鬼的牙——一种决不会错的切开吸血鬼皮肤的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
