<div class="line_en">This was a few days after Laila heard that Ahmad Shah Massoud had gone to France and spoken to the European Parliament. Massoud was now in his native North, and leading the Northern Alliance, the sole opposition group still fighting the Taliban. In Europe, Massoud had warned the West about terrorist camps in Afghanistan, and pleaded with the U. S. to help him fight the Taliban.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a paper bag, Aziza packed these things: her flowered shirt and her lone pair of socks, her mismatched wool gloves, an old, pumpkin-colored blanket dotted with stars and comets, a splintered plastic cup, a banana, her set of dice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿兹莎把这些东西收进一个纸袋：她的花衬衣和一对长袜，两只不配套的羊毛手套，一条缀满星星和彗星的南瓜色毛毯，一个已经有裂痕的塑料水杯，一个香蕉，一套骰子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a cool morning in April 2001, shortly before Laila's twenty-third birthday. The sky was a translucent gray, and gusts of a clammy, cold wind kept rattling the screen door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是2001年4月一个寒冷的早晨，莱拉23岁生日之前不久。天空灰蒙蒙的，阴湿的寒风一阵阵的，吹得纱门吱嘎、吱嘎响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A month before that, Laila had learned that the Taliban had planted TNT in the crevices of the giant Buddhas in Bamiyan and blown them apart, calling them objects of idolatry and sin. There was an outcry around the world, from the U. S. to China. Governments, historians, and archaeologists from all over the globe had written letters, pleaded with the Taliban not to demolish the two greatest historical artifacts in Afghanistan. But the Taliban had gone ahead and detonated their explosives inside the two-thousand-year-old Buddhas. They had chanted Allah-u-akbar with each blast, cheered each time the statues lost an arm or a leg in a crumbling cloud of dust. Laila remembered standing atop the bigger of the two Buddhas with Babi and Tariq, back in 1987, a breeze blowing in their sunlit faces, watching a hawk gliding in circles over the sprawling valley below. But when she heard the news of the statues' demise, Laila was numb to it. It hardly seemed to matter. How could she care about statues when her own life was crumbling dust?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前一个月，莱拉已经知道塔利班在巴米扬大佛的洞穴中安置了烈性炸药，指责大佛是偶像崇拜和罪恶的物体，将它们炸得粉碎。从美国到中国，举世哗然。全球各地的政府、历史学家和考古学家纷纷写信，请求塔利班别毁坏这两件阿富汗最大的历史文物。但塔利班不管不顾，引爆了埋藏在已存在两千年之久的大佛里面的炸药。每一声爆炸都引来他们“真主伟大”的赞颂，每当佛像在烟雾升腾之中失去一根胳膊或者一条腿，他们就会齐声欢呼。莱拉想起了从前，1987年，她曾和爸爸、塔里克站在两尊大佛中比较大那一尊的头顶，任凭和风吹拂着他们洒满阳光的脸庞，凝望着一只老鹰在下面开阔的山谷上方来回盘旋。但当听到佛像被毁的消息，莱拉无动于衷。自己的生活已然成了一堆尘土，她如何还能关心什么佛像？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Until Rasheed told her it was time to go, Laila sat on the floor in a corner of the living room, not speaking and stone-faced, her hair hanging around her face in straggly curls. No matter how much she breathed in and out, it seemed to Laila that she couldn't fill her lungs with enough air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德跟她说该走了，莱拉依旧坐在客厅角落的地板上，不言不语，脸上木无表情，一头鬈发凌乱地散落在脸庞前方。莱拉不管多么用力地呼吸，似乎总是不能给她的肺充上足够的空气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">ON THE WAY to Karteh-Seh, Zalmai bounced in Rasheed's arms, and Aziza held Mariam's hand as she walked quickly beside her. The wind blew the dirty scarf tied under Aziza's chin and rippled the hem of her dress. Aziza was more grim now, as though she'd begun to sense, with each step, that she was being duped. Laila had not found the strength to tell Aziza the truth. She had told her that she was going to a school, a special school where the children ate and slept and didn't come home after class. Now Aziza kept pelting Laila with the same questions she had been asking for days. Did the students sleep in different rooms or all in one great big room? Would she make friends? Was she, Laila, sure that the teachers would be nice?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前往卡德察区的路上，拉希德抱着察尔迈伊，阿兹莎握紧玛丽雅姆的手，和她并排匆匆地走着。风吹起系在阿兹莎脖子上那条脏兮兮的围巾，也吹皱了她的裙摆。阿兹莎的脸色越来越阴沉，仿佛她已经察觉到每踏出一步，她成为弃儿的时间就近了一点。莱拉没有勇气告诉阿兹莎真相。她说要送阿兹莎去学校，那是一个特殊的学校，学生在那儿吃饭和睡觉，下课之后不回家。这时阿兹莎连珠炮般向莱拉提问，这几天来她一直在问这样的问题：学生是分开房间睡觉还是统统睡在一个大房间里面？会有人跟她交朋友吗？莱拉确信老师会很友善吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aziza took it and muttered a thank-you. Laila marveled at Aziza's grace, Aziza's vast capacity for forgiveness, and her eyes filled. Her heart squeezed, and she was faint with sorrow at the thought that this afternoon Aziza would not nap beside her, that she would not feel the flimsy weight of Aziza's arm on her chest, the curve of Aziza's head pressing into her ribs, Aziza's breath warming her neck, Aziza's heels poking her belly.</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked the last two blocks alone, Mariam, Laila, and Aziza. As they approached the building, Laila could see its splintered façade, the sagging roof, the planks of wood nailed across frames with missing windows, the top of a swing set over a decaying wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila had a glimpse of the yard: weedy lot, rickety swing set, old tires, a deflated basketball. The rooms they passed were bare, the windows covered with sheets of plastic. A boy darted from one of the rooms and grabbed Laila's elbow, and tried to climb up into her arms. An attendant, who was cleaning up what looked like a puddle of urine, put down his mop and pried the boy off.</div>

They passed through poorly lit hallways where barefoot children stepped aside and watched. They had disheveled hair or shaved scalps. They wore sweaters with frayed sleeves, ragged jeans whose knees had worn down to strings, coats patched with duct tape. Laila smelled soap and talcum, ammonia and urine, and rising apprehension in Aziza, who had begun whimpering.</div>

<div class="line_en">That time, Laila went home. She lay on her stomach, feeling like a stupid, pitiable animal, and hissed as Mariam arranged damp cloths across her bloodied back and thighs. But, usually, Laila refused to cave in. She made as if she were going home, then took a different route down side streets. Sometimes she was caught, questioned, scolded -- two, three, even four times in a single day. Then the whips came down and the antennas sliced through the air, and she trudged home, bloodied, without so much as a glimpse of Aziza. Soon Laila took to wearing extra layers, even in the heat, two, three sweaters beneath the burqa, for padding against the beatings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一次，莱拉回到家里。她趴在地板上，觉得自己活像一只既可怜又愚蠢的动物；玛丽雅姆拿着一块湿布给她擦净后背和大腿的血迹，她不时痛得倒抽冷气。但是，莱拉通常拒绝受困家中。她装出一副回家的样子，然后换了一条路线，沿着马路的边缘走。有时候她会被逮住，受到盘问和斥责——每天两次、三次甚至四次。然后皮鞭和天线会劈头盖脸抽过来，她带着浑身血迹挣扎着走回家，至于阿兹莎，她连一眼都没看到。很快，莱拉就习惯了多穿几件衣服，就算天气很热，她也会在布卡下面穿两三件毛衣，为的是减轻一点挨打的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day, a young Talib beat Laila with a radio antenna. When he was done, he gave a final whack to the back of her neck and said, "I see you again, I'll beat you until your mother's milk leaks out of your bones."</div>

<div class="line_en">And so Laila's life suddenly revolved around finding ways to see Aziza. Half the time, she never made it to the orphanage. Crossing the street, she was spotted by the Taliban and riddled with questions -- What is your name? Where are you going? Why are you alone? Where is your mahram?-- before she was sent home. If she was lucky, she was given a tongue-lashing or a single kick to the rear, a shove in the back. Other times, she met with assortments of wooden clubs, fresh tree branches, short whips, slaps, often fists.</div>

<div class="line_en">They left the orphanage with Aziza that Friday afternoon for a short outing and met Rasheed, who was waiting for them by the bus stop. When Zalmai spotted his father, he uttered an excited squeak and impatiently wriggled from Laila's arms. Aziza's greeting to Rasheed was rigid but not hostile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个星期五下午，他们带着阿兹莎离开恤孤院，让她去跟在公共汽车站等他们的拉希德见上一面。看到他的父亲，察尔迈伊高兴地大喊了一声，在莱拉怀里扭来扭去。阿兹莎和拉希德打招呼的口气很生硬，不过并没有敌意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rasheed said they should hurry, he had only two hours before he had to report back to work. This was his first week as a doorman for the Intercontinental. From noon to eight, six days a week, Rasheed opened car doors, carried luggage, mopped up the occasional spill. Sometimes, at day's end, the cook at the buffet-style restaurant let Rasheed bring home a few leftovers -- as long as he was discreet about it -- cold meatballs sloshing in oil; fried chicken wings, the crust gone hard and dry; stuffed pasta shells turned chewy; stiff, gravelly rice. Rasheed had promised Laila that once he had some money saved up, Aziza could move back home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德说他们应该快点来，再过两个小时，他就得回去上班了。他在洲际饭店找了一份门卫的工作，这是他上班的第一个星期。工作时间是每周六天，从中午到晚上八点。拉希德的职责是替客人开车门和提行李，清扫偶尔溅在地上的液体。有时候，等到一天的工作结束，自助式餐厅的厨师会让拉希德带一些剩菜回家——只要他不把这件事说出去。通常是一些浸在油里的冷肉丸，外壳变得又干又硬的炸鸡翅，变得难以嚼动的贝壳意粉，坚硬的、混着沙子的米饭。拉希德曾经答应莱拉，等他存够钱就把阿兹莎接回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rasheed was wearing his uniform, a burgundy red polyester suit, white shirt, clip-on tie, visor cap pressing down on his white hair. In this uniform, Rasheed was transformed. He looked vulnerable, pitiably bewildered, almost harmless. Like someone who had accepted without a sigh of protest the indignities life had doled out to him. Someone both pathetic and admirable in his docility.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德穿着他的制服，酒红色的涤纶西装，白色的衬衣，用夹子夹住的领带，遮住他一头白发的大盖帽。穿着这身制服，拉希德仿佛变了一个人。他看上去脆弱而迷茫，几乎不露一点凶相，反而让人觉得他很可怜。就像一个对生活施舍给他的屈辱照单全收的人。一个老实得让人觉得既可怜又可佩的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They rode the bus to Titanic City. They walked into the riverbed, flanked on either side by makeshift stalls clinging to the dry banks. Near the bridge, as they were descending the steps, a barefoot man dangled dead from a crane, his ears cut off, his neck bent at the end of a rope. In the river, they melted into the horde of shoppers milling about, the money changers and bored-looking NGO workers, the cigarette vendors, the covered women who thrust fake antibiotic prescriptions at people and begged for money to fill them. Whip-toting, naswar-chewing Talibs patrolled Titanic City on the lookout for the indiscreet laugh, the unveiled face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们乘坐公共汽车到“泰坦尼克城”。他们走进河床，两边是临时摆在干涸堤岸上的摊档。他们沿着桥边的阶梯朝下走，看到一个赤足的男人被吊死在起重机上，他的耳朵被切掉了，脖子垂在一根绳子的末端。他们走进了喀布尔河，周围到处是招徕生意的商人，兑换外币的人，满脸疲惫的非政府组织工作人员，卖香烟的小贩，还有一些蒙着脸的妇女将伪造的抗生素处方给过往的行人看，跟他们讨钱去开药。挥舞着皮鞭、嚼着烟草块的塔利班在泰坦尼克城里面巡逻，随时准备给那些放肆的笑声和未曾遮住的脸庞一点教训。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rasheed's eyebrows shot up when the seller quoted him the price. A round of haggling ensued, at the end of which Rasheed said to Aziza contentiously, as if it were she who'd haggled him, "Give it back. I can't afford both."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当小贩说出价钱的时候，拉希德双眉一扬。他跟小贩讨价还价。最后，拉希德恶声恶气地对阿兹莎——好像跟他讨价还价的人是她——说：“把它放回去，我买不起。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, after Rasheed had dropped them off and taken a bus to work, Laila watched Aziza wave good-bye and scuff along the wall in the orphanage back lot. She thought of Aziza's stutter, and of what Aziza had said earlier about fractures and powerful collisions deep down and how sometimes all we see on the surface is a slight tremor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，等到拉希德和他们道别、乘坐公共汽车去上班之后，莱拉看着阿兹莎挥手和他们道别，拖着沉重的脚步，沿着恤孤院后院的围墙走过去。她想起阿兹莎的口吃，想起阿兹莎刚才跟她谈到的断层和地壳深处猛烈的碰撞，想起她说有时候地面上的我们只感觉到一阵轻微的震动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A choking noise came up her throat. Her knees weakened. Laila suddenly wanted, needed, to grope for Mariam's arm, her shoulder, her wrist, something, anything, to lean on. But she didn't. She didn't dare. She didn't dare move a muscle. She didn't dare breathe, or blink even, for fear that he was nothing but a mirage shimmering in the distance, a brittle illusion that would vanish at the slightest provocation. Laila stood perfectly still and looked at Tariq until her chest screamed for air and her eyes burned to blink. And, somehow, miraculously, after she took a breath, closed and opened her eyes, he was still standing there. Tariq was still standing there.</div>
