<div class="line_en">That Easter morning of 1949 was glorious. The whole island was carpeted with flowers, and Palermo balconies held huge tubs of wildly rioting colors; the cracks in the sidewalk grew red- and blue- and white-petaled flowers, and so, even, did the sides of old churches. The streets of Palermo were thronged with citizens going to the nine o'clock High Mass at Palermo's great cathedral where the Cardinal himself would serve Communion. Countrymen from the nearby villages had come in to attend, and in their black mourning suits, with their wives and children, they greeted everyone they passed with the traditional Easter morning salute of the peasant, "Christ is risen." Turi Guiliano responded with the equally traditional, "Blessed be His name."</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano and his men had infiltrated Palermo the night before. They were dressed in the sober country black of the peasants, but their suit jackets were loose and bulky, for beneath they wore their machine pistols. Guiliano was familiar with the streets of Palermo; in his six years as a bandit he had often sneaked into the city to direct the kidnapping of a wealthy noble or to dine at a famous restaurant and to leave his challenging note under the plate.</div>

<div class="line_en">This morning, Guiliano had brought fifty men into the city. They included Aspanu Pisciotta, the Corporal, and Terranova; Passatempo and Stefano Andolini had been left behind. When Guiliano and Pisciotta entered the cathedral, forty of his men entered with them; the other ten men with the Corporal and Terranova were with the escape vehicles in the rear of the building.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another two men would walk twenty paces ahead of him, four more would walk on the other side of the street, another two men would walk twenty paces behind. And another two-man team still further back.

When he entered a restaurant, the dining rooms would be crowded with his bodyguards at other tables.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他前面大约二十步开外的地方有两个人，街对面有四个人，此外离他身后二十步还有一个二人小组。如果宪兵拦住吉里安诺要他出示证件，就会很自然地成为这些人的目标，遭到这些人毫不留情的枪击。只要他走进一家餐馆，他的保镖们就会占据其他的餐桌，把整个餐厅挤得满满的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Cardinal was conducting the Mass, and in his white and golden vestments, the great crucifix hanging from his neck, and with his melodious voice, he created an awesome aura of inviolable sanctity. The cathedral was filled with great statues of Christ and the Virgin Mary. Guiliano dipped his fingers into the holy water basin decorated with reliefs of the Passion of Christ. When he knelt he saw the vast domed ceiling and along the walls the banks of rose-colored candles that served as votive lights to the statues of saints.</div>

<div class="line_en">The chanting of the priests and altar boys, the murmured responses to the multitude of worshippers, the perfume of exotic subtropical flowers on the altar, the devoutness of these supplicants had their effect on Guiliano. The last time he had attended Mass was the Easter morning five years before when Frisella, the barber, had betrayed him. On this Easter morning he felt a sense of loss and of dread. How many times had he said to doomed enemies, "I execute you in the name of God and Sicily," and waited for them to murmur the prayers he heard now. For a moment he wished he could make them all rise, as Christ had risen, to lift them out of the eternal darkness he had hurled them into. And now on this Easter morning he might have to send a Cardinal of the Church to join them. This Cardinal had broken his promise, had lied to and betrayed him, and become his enemy. It did not matter how beautifully he chanted in this vast cathedral. Would it be impertinent to tell the Cardinal to make his peace with God? Would not a Cardinal always be in a state of grace? Would he be humble enough to confess his betrayal of Guiliano?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修士和祭坛助手在吟唱，信众们低声回应着，祭坛上奇异的亚热带花卉释放着芳香，求取圣餐者无比虔诚，吉里安诺深深地被此情此景触动。他上次参加弥撒活动是五年前的复活节早晨，那时理发匠弗里塞拉背叛了他。现在这个复活节的早晨，他感到失落和害怕。他不止一次对即将被处死的敌人说：“我以上帝和西西里的名义处决你们。”然后等他们低声向上帝祈祷，祈祷词跟他现在听到的一样。在短暂的瞬间，他真希望自己能让他们像基督一样复活，是他把他们打入了永恒的黑暗深渊，他希望自己能把他们解救出来。这个复活节的早晨，他也许不得不让红衣主教加入他们的行列。这个主教违背了自己的诺言，不仅欺骗了他，而且背叛了他，成了他的敌人。在这座大教堂里，他的弥撒做得再动听也没有意义了。现在就让红衣主教向上帝忏悔是否不合时宜？难道红衣主教就不会威风扫地吗？他会放下架子对吉里安诺坦白自己的背叛行为吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano's men dispersed themselves along the walls close to the altar. The seats were filled by the vast multitude of worshippers, the countrymen in black, the townspeople in vivid Easter finery. Guiliano found himself standing by the famous statue of the Virgin and the Apostles, and he was caught by its beauty for one brief moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺的人在离祭坛较近的地方沿墙边散开。座位上坐满了虔诚的信众，农村人穿着黑衣服，城里人则穿着节日盛装。吉里安诺突然发现身边的圣母与众使徒的雕像，不禁对它的精美感叹不已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Mass was coming to its conclusion; the worshippers were going to the altar rail to receive Holy Communion. Some of Guiliano's men along the walls were kneeling to receive. They had confessed to Abbot Manfredi at his monastery the day before and were pure, since they would not have to commit their crime until after this ceremony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弥撒活动已接近尾声；虔诚的信徒纷纷走向祭坛的护栏接受圣餐。吉里安诺的几个手下正跪在靠墙的地方接受圣餐，因为前一天他们在修道院向曼弗雷迪院长做过忏悔，直到这次弥撒结束他们都是纯洁的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The multitude of worshippers, happy with the Easter rising of Christ, cheerful for the washing out of their sins, exited the cathedral and filled the piazza going on to the avenue. The Cardinal went behind the altar and his acolyte pressed upon his brow the conical mitre of an Archbishop. With this headdress the Cardinal seemed a foot taller, the elaborate gold scrolls on the front of the miter gleamed over his rugged Sicilian face; the impression was one of power rather than holiness. Accompanied by a flock of priests, he started on his traditional steps of prayer at each of the four chapels of the cathedral.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="信众们为基督的复活感到高兴，也为自己洗清了罪过而感到高兴。他们走出教堂，穿过广场向大街走去。红衣主教走到祭坛后边，助手把大主教的锥形法冠给他戴上。法冠让他的个子看上去似乎高了一英尺。法冠上精致的黄金漩涡装饰熠熠发光，照着他那张西西里人轮廓分明的面庞，人们感到的是他的权势，而不是神圣。在一群修士的簇拥下，他开始前往教堂里的四个私人祈祷处进行传统祈祷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first chapel held the tomb of King Roger I, the second chapel that of the Emperor Frederick II; the third held the tomb of Henry IV, the last chapel held the ashes of Constanzia, the wife of Frederick II. These tombs were of white marble inlaid with beautiful mosaics. There was another separate chapel, the silver shrine, holding a thousand-pound statue of Saint Rosalia, the patron saint of Palermo, which the citizens of the city carried through the streets on her holy day. In this shrine were the remains of all the archbishops of Palermo, and it would be here that the Cardinal himself would be buried when he died. It was his first stop, and when he knelt to pray, it was here that Guiliano and his men surrounded him and his retinue. Other of Guiliano's men sealed off all the exits to the shrine so no alarm could be given.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个祈祷处是罗杰国王一世的墓，第二个是弗里德里克皇帝二世的墓，第三个是亨利四世的墓，第四个是安葬着弗里德里克皇帝二世的皇后康斯坦齐娅骨灰的墓。这些陵墓都是白色大理石建造，上面镶着漂亮的马赛克。此外还有一个单独的祈祷处，那就是供奉着重达一千磅的圣罗沙利雕像的银质神龛。圣罗沙利是巴勒莫的保护神，每逢她的圣日，巴勒莫人就抬着她的雕像在街上游行。在这个神龛里安葬着巴勒莫的所有主教，红衣主教辞世后也将安葬在这里。这里是他停留的第一站。就在他跪下祈祷的时候，吉里安诺和他率领的人把他和他的随从团团围住。吉里安诺的人还封锁了神龛的所有通道，这样就不可能有人去报警。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Cardinal rose to his feet to confront them. But then he saw Pisciotta. He remembered that face. But not as it was now. Now it was the face of the devil come for his soul, to roast his flesh in hell. Guiliano said, "Your Eminence, you are my prisoner. If you do what I say you will not be harmed. You will spend Easter in the mountains as my guest and I promise that you will dine as well there as in your palace."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="红衣主教站起身正视他们。就在这时候他看见了皮肖塔。他想起了这张脸，但却不是现在的模样。现在这张脸属于一个魔鬼，前来索取他的灵魂，在地狱炙烤他的肉体。吉里安诺说：“大人，你现在是我的俘虏。如果你照我说的做，就不会受到伤害。你将作为我的客人进山过复活节，我保证你在那里能吃到跟宫殿里一样的美味佳肴。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Two of his men also seated themselves in the rear of the car, and Aspanu Pisciotta got into the front seat beside the chauffeur. Then the procession of cars wound its way through the city, through the patrols of carabinieri who saluted them. At Guiliano's orders, the Cardinal waved back in benediction. On a deserted stretch of road the Cardinal was made to leave the car. Another band of Guiliano's men were waiting for them with a litter to carry the Cardinal. Leaving the vehicles and chauffeurs behind them, they all disappeared into a sea of flowers and the mountains.</div>
