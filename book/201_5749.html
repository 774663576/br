<div class="line_en">Harry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone would, surely check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in… and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them.

<div class="line_en">He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他仿佛听见了湖边树叶的沙沙声和远处一只猫头鹰的叫声，但是并没有人来检查车厢，甚至（他有点看不起自己居然存有这种希望）没有人惊慌地询问哈利·波特怎么不见了。他想象着夜骐拉的车队慢慢朝学校移动，马尔福坐在马车里发出一阵阵刺耳的大笑，他肯定在跟他那些斯莱特林的同学们讲述他是怎么教训哈利·波特的…想到这儿，一种绝望的情绪在他心头蔓延开来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it…</div>

<div class="line_en">He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words "Accio Wand!" over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利匆匆跟着她来到过道里。唐克斯拉开车门，纵身跳到了站台上。随着火车加速，下面的站台似乎在向后滑动。哈利跟着她跳了下去，落地时差点儿摔倒。他直起身子，正好看见鲜红耀眼的蒸汽机车加快了速度，拐过一个弯道，消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak.</div>

<div class="line_en">They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn't been her fault at all, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius's death; it was no more her fault than anyone else's (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks's long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们顺着马车刚压出的车辙，艰难地走在漆黑荒凉的小路上。哈利从隐形衣下侧脸看着唐克斯。去年，她是那么爱打听别人的事情（有时甚至有点惹人讨厌），那么爱笑，那么爱讲笑话。现在她好像一下子老了好几岁，显得严肃和刚毅多了。这难道都是部里发生的那件事带来的后果吗？他不安地想到，赫敏肯定会建议他对唐克斯说一些安慰的话，说小天狼星的死根本不能怪她，但是，他没有勇气这么说。他丝毫不认为小天狼星的死是唐克斯的过错，她的责任不比任何人大（更不比他的大），但是他实在不愿意谈到小天狼星，能回避就尽量回避。于是，他们默默地走在寒冷的夜色中，唐克斯的斗篷拖在身后的地上，发出沙沙的响声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利以前都是坐的马车，从不知道霍格沃茨离霍格莫德车站有多远。当他终于看见学校大门两边高高的、顶上装饰着带翼的野猪石柱时，总算松了口气。他又冷又饿，而且巴不得赶紧离开这位陌生的、脸色阴沉的唐克斯。可是当他伸手推大门时，发现大门用链条锁住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alohomora!" he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利转过脸来。“我可以翻墙进去。”他提议道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well then," said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, "I suppose I'll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning."</div>

<div class="line_en">A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch's wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远处城堡脚下出现了一盏摇摇晃晃的提灯。哈利高兴极了，他觉得他甚至能够忍受费尔奇呼哧带喘地批评他迟到，并叫嚷着说如果定期给他动点儿酷刑，他的时间观念就会增强了。闪亮的橙黄色灯光离他只有十来步远了，哈利脱掉隐形衣好让来人看见他，这时他才认出了斯内普那个被灯光从下面照亮的鹰钩鼻和那一头乌黑油腻的长发，他顿时产生了一种强烈的厌恶感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry's forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利觉得自己身体里释放出非常强烈的仇恨，他简直不敢相信斯内普竟然感觉不到这些仇恨在烧灼着他。他们从第一次见面起，他就讨厌斯内普，而斯内普对待小天狼星的态度，又使哈利永远也不可能原谅他。不管邓布利多怎么说，哈利在暑假里反复思忖之后得出了这样的结论：斯内普不怀好意地讥讽小天狼星，说凤凰社的其他成员都在跟伏地魔战斗，而他却躲在安全的地方，后来正是斯内普的这番话促使小天狼星在那天夜里冲进魔法部，丢掉了性命。哈利抱着这种想法不放，他这样就可以把责任怪罪到斯内普身上，这使他感到解恨，而且他知道，如果有谁对小天狼星的死无动于衷，那就是此刻在黑暗中走在他身边的这个男人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry's mind, however, Snape said, "No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I'm sure."</div>

The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.</div>

The castle's magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them -- in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and others' safety."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我需要格外强调的是，目前局势非常危险，我们霍格沃茨的每一个人都需要万分谨慎才能保证自身的安全。城堡的魔法防御工事在暑假期间被加强了，我们得到了新的、更有效的保护，但是我们每一位师生仍然必须时刻提高警惕，丝毫不能掉以轻心。因此，我要求你们必须严格遵守老师制定的每一条安全规定，不管那些条条框框可能有多么烦人——特别要遵守熄灯后不得起床外出的规定。我恳请你们，不管在校内还是校外，只要发现任何异常或可疑的情况，都要立刻向教工汇报。我相信你们，为了自己和他人的安全，一定会约束自己的行为的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster's words unworthy of his attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多说话时，礼堂里一片紧张的、揪心的沉默。哈利扫了一眼马尔福。马尔福没有看着邓布利多，而是用魔杖把他的叉子悬在半空中，仿佛他觉得校长的话根本不值得一听。">查看中文翻译</div>
