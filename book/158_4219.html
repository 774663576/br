<div class="line_en">A bell began to ring. It was for a baptism. The fat girl had a child being brought up among the peasants of Yvetot. She had not seen it for a year, or thought of it; but now the idea of a child being baptized threw into her heart a sudden and violent tenderness for her own, and she strongly wished to be present at the ceremony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵钟声传过来了。那是为了一场洗礼。胖“姑娘”本有一个孩子养在伊勿朵的农人家里，她每年看不见他一回，并且从不对他记挂；不过现在想起这一个就要被人送去受洗的孩子，她心里对自己的那一个动了一种突然而起的热烈慈爱，于是她坚决地要去参观这一场礼节。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the commonplace nature of Mrs. Loiseatu burst out with:</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, we are not going to stay here to die of old age. Since it is the trade of this creature to accommodate herself to all kinds, I fail to see how she has the right to refuse one more than another. I can tell you she has received all she could find in Rouen, even the coach-men! Yes, Madame, the prefect's coachman! I know him very well, for he bought his wine at our house. And to think that to-day we should be drawn into this embarrassment by this affected woman, this minx! For my part, I find that this officer conducts himself very well. He has perhaps suffered privations for a long time; and doubtless he would have preferred us three; but no, he is contented with common property. He respects married women. And we must remember too that he is master. He has only to say'I wish,'and he could take us by force with his soldiers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然而我们不会老死在这儿。既然和一切的男人那么干，本是她的职业，这个贱货的职业，我认为她并没有权力来选精择肥。我现在请教一下：在卢昂她碰见谁就要谁，甚至于好些赶车的她也要！对呀，夫人，州长的赶车的！我很知道他，我，他到我店里买他喝的酒。今天遇着要给我们解除困难，她倒要撒娇，这个拖着鼻涕的家伙！我呢，认为他很懂规矩，这个军官。他也许旷了很久，我们三个无疑都是可以被他赏识的。但是他并不那么做，而满意于这个属于公共的女人。他敬重有夫之妇哪。您揣想一下吧，他是主人翁。只须开口说一声“我要”。就可以用他的部下仗着蛮劲来抓我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as she was gone, everybody looked at each other, then pulled their chairs together, for they thought that finally something should be decided upon. Loiseau had an inspiration: it was to hold Ball-of-Fat alone and let the others go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她刚好出去，大家互相使着眼色，随后就把椅子搬拢来，因为都很觉得终于应当有个决定。鸟老板动了灵感，说道：他主张去向军官提议，只把羊脂球扣下来而让其余的人都走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Follenvie was charged with the commission, but he returned almost immediately, for the German, who understood human nature, had put him out. He pretended that he would retain everybody so long as his desire was not satisfied.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two women had a cold shiver. Pretty Mrs. Carré-Lamadon's eyes grew brilliant and she became a little pale, as if she saw herself already taken by force by the officer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其余两个妇人都轻轻地打了一个寒噤。漂亮的迦来－辣马东夫人的眼睛发光了，她的脸色有点苍白了，如同觉得自己已经被军官用蛮劲抓住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The women kept together, the tone of their voices was lowered, each gave advice and the discussion was general. Everything was very harmonious. The ladies especially found delicate shades and charming subtleties of expression for saying the most unusual things. A stranger would have understood nothing, so great was the precaution of language observed. But the light edge of modesty, with which every woman of the world is barbed, only covers the surface; they blossom out in a scandalous adventure of this kind, being deeply amused and feeling themselves in their element, mixing love with sensuality as a greedy cook prepares supper for his master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妇人们交头接耳压低了声音，而且讨论得普遍，每一个人发表了自己的见解，究竟那是很合身份的，尤其是为了说出最不顺口的事情，这些贵妇人都找着了种种玲珑的转折，种种巧妙的动人口吻。语言上戒备得真严，一个局外的人可以一点也不懂。不过那层给上流妇人做掩护的薄薄的廉耻之感只蒙着表面，所以她们在这种放纵的冒险之中都是心花怒放的，都是实在快活得发痴的，都觉得正对她们的劲儿，把爱情和肉欲混在一块儿，好像一个馋嘴的厨子正给另一个人烹调肉汤一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The men met and discussed the situation. Loiseau, furious, was for delivering"the wretch" bound hand and foot to the enemy. But the Count, descended through three generations of ambassadors, and endowed with the temperament of a diplomatist, was the advocate of ingenuity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男人们本来都在另一旁说话，现在都走过来了，气忿忿的鸟老板想把“这个贱东西”的手脚缚起来送给别人。不过伯爵出身于三代都做过大使的家庭并且具有外交家的外貌，却主张用巧妙手腕：“应当教她自己决定。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So entirely were their minds distracted that they did not hear Ball-of-Fat enter. The Count uttered a light"Ssh!"Which turned all eyes in her direction. There she was. The abrupt silence and a certain embarrassment hindered them from speaking to her at first. The Countess, more accustomed to the duplicity of society than the others, finally inquired: "Was it very amusing, that baptism?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一种很深刻的注意使得大家的头脑都是紧张的，以至于没有听见羊脂球正走进来。伯爵轻轻地嘘了一声，所有的眼睛都重新抬起了。她在跟前了，人们都突然不再发言，开初并且有某种尴尬心理阻止人向她说话。伯爵夫人是比其余的妇人更熟悉于客厅式的两面作风的，她向羊脂球问道：“可有趣味，那一场洗礼？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even gaiety returned, so funny did the whole story seem to them at last. The Count found some of the jokes a little off color, but they were so well told that he was forced to smile. In his turn, Loiseau came out with some still boldertales, and yet nobody was wounded. The brutal thought, expressed by his wife, dominated all minds:"Since it is her trade, why should she refuse this one more than another?"The genteel Mrs. Carré-Lamadon seemed to think that in her place, she would refuse this one less than some others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="故事到末了真教人觉得滑稽，快乐的心情自然而然地发生了。伯爵找着那些趣味略辛辣的诙谐，不过叙述得非常之好只教人微笑。轮到了鸟老板，他发挥了三五段比较生硬的猥亵之谈，大家都简直不以为刺耳；后来他妻子粗率地发表的意见取得了全体的认可，她说：“既然那是这个‘姑娘’的职业，为什么她可以拒绝这一个比拒绝另一个厉害？”和蔼的迦来－辣马东夫人仿佛想起自己若是处于羊脂球的地位，那么她拒绝这个军官可以不及拒绝旁的一个人厉害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They prepared the blockade at length, as if they were about to surround a bear, some maneuvers that he would endeavor to put into execution. They decided on the plan of attack, the ruse to employ, the surprise of assault, that should force this living citadel to receive the enemy in her room.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the table they commenced the approach. This was in the shape of a vague conversation upon devotion. They cited ancient examples: Judith and Holophernes, then, without reason, Lucrece and Sextus, and Cleopatra obliging all the generals of the enemy to pass by her couch and reducing them in servility to slaves. Then they brought out a fantastic story, hatched in the imagination of these ignorant millionaires, where the women of Rome went to Capua for the purpose of lulling Hannibal to sleep in their arms, and his lieutenants and phalanxes of mercenaries as well. They cited all the women who have been taken by conquering armies, making a battlefield of their bodies, making them also a weapon, and a means of success; and all those hideous and detestable beings who have conquered by their heroic caresses, and sacrificed their chastity to vengeance or a beloved cause.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一下坐到饭桌上，大家都着手来做种种接近功夫。开初那是一阵有关于献身出力的泛泛议论。有人举出了好些古代的例子：茹狄德和何洛斐伦，随后没来由地又提到了吕克蕾和塞克斯都斯，以及克莱沃葩蒂使得敌军将领们经过她的床上以后全体都变成忠实的奴隶。这样一来，一件虚构的历史又在这几个不学无术的家资百万的富翁的想象当中孵化出来了：罗马的女公民走到迦布埃城，教汉尼巴以及他的将佐士兵都在她们的怀里酣睡。他们述及所有擒获了征服者的妇女们，说她们把自己的身体做一种战场，做一种征服的方法，做一种武器，她们用种种英雄式的爱抚战败了好些丑恶的或者可鄙的敌人，并且把自己的贞操牺牲于复仇和献身报国。">查看中文翻译</div>
