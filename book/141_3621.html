<div class="line_en">Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board the Mongolia, who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon, was following Mr. Fogg's tracks step by step. What was Fix's object? Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes -- which he religiously preserved -- that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them, and probably on the same steamer.</div>

<div class="line_en">The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his inveterate habit, took a hand at whist.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's clear!" repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his shrewdness. "He's a spy sent to keep us in view! That isn't quite the thing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who is so honourable a man! Ah, gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这么回事！准没错儿！”这个老实的小伙子自言自语地说，他非常满意自己的判断力。“他是那些老爷们派来跟踪我们的密探！这事干得可真不体面！福克先生为人这么诚实，又这么有信用，叫个密探盯他的梢！啊！改良俱乐部的老爷们，这件事你们可又不上算了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe. But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable. Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg's friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路路通就是想上一百年，他也想不出来这位侦探要跟着他们干什么。他绝没想到斐利亚—福克会被人家当作窃贼盯在后头，满世界兜圈子。但是，路路通是属于那种对任何事都能找出答案的人，他现在一下子恍然大悟了，他找到了费克斯一直盯住他们的答案，而且说真话，这个答案倒象是很入情合理的。其实在路路通看来，费克斯只是，也只会是改良俱乐部和福克打赌的同僚们派来跟踪的人，目的是要了解福克先生这次环游地球，是不是按照商定的路线老老实实进行的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say nothing to his master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries.

<div class="line_en">During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers. The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a. m., to receive coal, having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="10月30日星期三下午，仰光号进入了马六甲半岛和苏门答腊当中的马六甲海峡。许多险峻秀丽的小山岛吸引着旅客的注意，使他们顾不得再去欣赏苏门答腊的风光。第二天早晨四点钟，仰光号比规定航行时间提前半天到达新加坡。它要在这里加煤。斐利亚—福克把这提早的半天时间记在旅行日程表的“盈余时间”栏内。因为艾娥达夫人希望利用这几小时上岸去走走，所以福克先生就陪她一齐下了船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome carriage, drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower. Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields; sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新加坡岛的外貌既不广阔又不雄伟，它缺少作为海岛背景的大山，但是它仍然十分清秀可爱。它象是一座交织着美丽的公路的花园。艾娥达夫人和福克先生坐在一辆漂亮的马车里，前面由两匹新荷兰进口的骏马拖着，在长着绿油油叶子的棕榈和丁香树丛中奔驰。有名的丁香子就是由这些丁香树上半开的花心作成的。这里一丛丛的胡椒树，代替了在欧洲农村用带刺植物筑成的篱笆，椰子树和大棵的羊齿草伸展着密茂的枝叶，点缀着这热带地区的风景。那些深色绿叶的豆蔻树播散着浓郁的香气。树林里还有成群鬼鬼祟祟的猴子。有时在这密茂的树林里也会发现老虎的踪迹。如果你感到惊奇，要想知道为什么在这个并不算大的岛上直到现在还没有消灭这种可怕的野兽，人们会告诉你，这些野兽都是从马六甲泅水过来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking, irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked, closely followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾娥达夫人和她的旅伴坐着马车在乡下游览了两小时，福克先生心不在焉地观赏了一下周围的风光，于是他们就回城里去了。这是一个挤满了高楼大厦的城市。城市周围有很多美丽的花园。花园里种着芒果树、凤梨和各种世界上最美味的果树。十点钟他们又回到船上。费克斯也坐了一辆马车盯着他们兜了一圈，什么也没有发现，现在他又得自己付出车钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes -- a fruit as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords gourmands a delicious sensation -- was waiting for them on deck. He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very gracefully for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路路通在仰光号甲板上等着他们。他买了几十个象普通苹果一样大的芒果。这种水果外面的皮是深棕色的，里面的皮是鲜红色的，中间的果肉却是雪白的。好吃的人把它往嘴里一放真会感到无比的鲜美。路路通兴高采烈地把这些芒果送给艾娥达夫人，艾娥达亲切地向他表示了感谢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view. Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of Hong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast. Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama, the principal Japanese port.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked at Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen, Malays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仰光号上的旅客非常多。很多都是在新加坡上的船，其中有印度人、锡兰人、中国人、马来亚人和葡萄牙人，他们大多数都是二等舱的旅客。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last quarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus aided the steamer's progress. The captain as often as possible put up his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon, however, unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least. Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot impatience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气本来一直相当好，但是，随着半圆的月亮在东方出现的时候，天气变坏了。海上滚动着巨浪，海风有时刮得很紧，幸亏风是从东南方吹来的，它有利于仰光号的航行。当风向还比较顺利的时候，船长命令张起全部船帆。仰光号上有双桅船的装备，它经常张起前桅帆和两个角帆航行。由于海风和引擎的双重动力，航行的速度大大提高。仰光号就这样在急促而有时使人晕眩的海浪中，沿着安南和交趾支那的海岸前进。船上大部分旅客都由于船身不停地颠簸而晕船了。造成这种情况的主要原因与其说是海浪，倒不如说是仰光号本身。说实在话，这些在中国沿海航行的半岛公司的轮船在构造方面确实有严重的缺点。对于空船和满载两种排水量的比例计算得很不正确，因此就经不起海上的风浪。它们底部不透水的密封水舱的容积也不够大。用海船上的术语来说就是“喝饱了”，所以在这种情况下，只要再有几个大浪头打到船上，它就不能再照原样航行了。这种船要和法国的皇后号和柬埔寨号那些邮船来比，即使不比引擎和蒸汽机，就是光比船型也差得很远。象皇后号这一类法国邮船，按照工程师的计算即使浸入舱底的海水重量等于邮船本身的重量，也不会沉船。可是半岛公司的船，从加尔各答号、高丽号，一直到仰光号，只要浸入海水的重量达到船身重量的六分之一，船身就会沉入海底。所以，一遇到坏天气就得加倍小心。有时还必须收起大帆放慢速度前进。这简直是浪费时间。虽然福克先生丝毫也没有因此表现出任何烦恼情绪，但是路路通可早就急得受不住了。他埋怨船长，埋怨大副，埋怨公司，他把船上所有的工作人员都骂了。也许是因为他想起了赛微乐街他那个没有关闭的煤气炉子，时时刻刻在耗费着他自己的钱，所以才显得更加急躁不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections. He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective. But had he told his master? What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not? Was the game, then, up? Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course it was best to take.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一段谈话结束之后，费克斯回到自己的房舱便开始琢磨起来。毫无疑问，他是被人家看穿了。无论如何反正这个法国人是知道他是密探了。可是，他告诉了他主人没有？他在这件事里面是个什么角色呢？他会不会是福克的同谋？这件事是不是已经漏底了，所以也就算吹了呢？费克斯很苦恼地想了好几个钟头，一会儿觉得一切都完了，一会儿又希望福克完全不了解他的情况，最后他还是不知道该怎么办才好。">查看中文翻译</div>

Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the robber.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不错，这件事使路路通天天都感到奇怪。他从年轻的艾娥达夫人眼里看出了她对自己主人的无限感激之情。而斐利亚—福克心里显然是只想到英勇果敢地，而不是深情脉脉地尽自己的义务。至于目前旅行中可能碰到的事，以及这些事对他可能产生的影响，他根本就没有放在心上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是路路通却一直心神不定。有一天他伏在机车间的栏杆上，看着这架有时象发怒似的大机器在飞快转动，这时由于船身急剧地前后颠簸，推进器一露出水面就飞快地空转，于是活塞的运动就引起蒸汽不停地劈拍爆炸。路路通看了这种情况，好象他自己也要给气炸了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout. Meanwhile Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference. He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him. Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star, which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman's heart. But no! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout's great surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是费克斯和路路通相互之间的微妙关系。而斐利亚—福克则象是一颗高悬在他们之上的行星，漫不经心地在天空运行。他沿着自己的轨道环游地球，毫不忧虑那些在它周围运行的小行星。但是在它旁边现在有一颗被天文学家称为“扰他”的女星，它本应该会在这位绅士的心中引起一些紊乱。然而事实并不是这样。艾娥达夫人的美丽对福克先生竟未发生任何影响，这真使路路通非常奇怪。如果这个“扰他”星所造成的星辰错乱真的成为事实的话，那将会比天王星所发生的星辰错乱（人们依靠天王星的星辰错乱，才发现了海王星）更加难以推算。">查看中文翻译</div>
