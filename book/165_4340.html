<div class="line_en">Six years had passed since their return from Australia, but the trials of the Great Resettlement and the intervening years seemed to have left no mark on AA. She was like a fresh, resilient plant that allowed the hardships of the past to roll off her smooth leaves. During these six years, Cheng Xin's company had developed rapidly under AA's management and become one of the prominent players in near-orbit space construction. But AA didn't look like a powerful CEO; instead, she retained the look of a lively, fun young woman. Of course, that was not unusual in this age.</div>

<div class="line_en">The six years hadn't touched Cheng Xin either -- she had spent them in hibernation. After their return from Australia, her blindness had been examined and diagnosed. It had started out as psychosomatic -- the result of extreme emotional distress -- but later developed into a detached retina followed by necrosis. The recommended treatment was to produce cloned retinas suitable for transplant out of stem cells developed from her DNA, but the process would take five years. Cheng Xin spending five years in complete darkness in her extremely depressed state would have led to total breakdown, and so the doctors allowed her to hibernate.</div>

<div class="line_en">Retaliation against the Earth Security Force followed. Objectively speaking, the good done by the ESF far exceeded that done by the Resistance. The ESF had been able to protect the big cities and other basic infrastructure. Although they had done so for the benefit of Trisolaran civilization, their efforts allowed the world to recover economically after the Great Resettlement with minimal delay. During the post-resettlement evacuation of Australia, Australia almost plunged into total chaos multiple times due to the lack of food and electricity, and it was the ESF that maintained order and kept supplies flowing, making it possible to complete the evacuation in four months. During that extraordinary, tumultuous time, if this well-equipped armed force had not been present, the results would have been unimaginably tragic. But none of these accomplishments were taken into account by the tribunals sitting in judgment over them. All ESF members were tried, and half were convicted of crimes against humanity. During the Great Resettlement, many nations revived capital punishment, and this persisted even after the return from Australia. During these five years, many former ESF members were executed, even though many among the cheering crowd had also submitted applications to the ESF.</div>

Blue Space and Gravity became salvation ships out of myths, and the two crews became superheroes worshipped by all. The charge that Blue Space had committed suspected murder during the dark battles was withdrawn, and replaced with the affirmation that it had acted in justified self-defense after being attacked. Simultaneously, members of the Earth Resistance Movement who had persisted in a hopeless struggle during the Great Resettlement were also hailed as heroes. When those resistance fighters dressed in rags appeared before the public, everyone felt hot tears in their eyes. Blue Space, Gravity, and the Resistance became symbols of the grandness of the human spirit, and countless worshippers seemed to think that they themselves had also always possessed such spirit.</div>

<div class="line_en">This tranquility was premised on this fact: When Luo Ji had conducted his dark forest experiment, 157 years had passed between when he first broadcast the coordinates of 187J3X1 to the universe and when that star was destroyed. That was equivalent to the life span of a modern human. To be sure, birthrates declined to their lowest levels in recorded history because no one wanted to bring a child into a world doomed to die.

<div class="line_en">The first piece of evidence: Luo Ji's dark forest experiment that led to the destruction of 187J3X1 and its planetary system. The supposition that the system had been destroyed by some extraterrestrial intelligence had always been controversial. The astronomical community had always voiced the loudest objections. There were two main views: One camp believed that the object observed striking the star at lightspeed was insufficient to destroy the star. The death of 187J3X1 was thus likely the result of a natural supernova. Since there was incomplete predestruction data for this star, it was impossible to say definitively whether the star possessed the requisite conditions for going supernova. Considering the long time that elapsed between Luo Ji's broadcast and the star's explosion, there was a high probability that the event was indeed natural. A second camp conceded that a lightspeed object did kill the star, but the "photoid" might very well be a natural phenomenon in the galaxy. Although to date no second photoid had been detected, there had been observations of massive objects being accelerated to extremely high speeds by naturally occurring forces. For instance, a supermassive black hole near the center of the galaxy was perfectly capable of accelerating some small object to near the speed of light. In fact, the center of the galaxy might produce a large number of such projectiles, but due to their small size, they were rarely seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="疑点一：罗辉的黑暗森林试验导致187J3X1恒星系被摧毁。该星系是否真是由外部的智慧力量所摧毁一直存在争议。最大的质疑来自天文学界，主要观点有两种：一种观点认为，所观察到的击中恒星的光速物体不足以摧毁恒星，187J3X1星系的毁灭可能是一次自然的超新星爆发，由于之前对这颗恒星的参数掌握不足，无法确定它是否具备新星或超新星爆发的条件；但也无法证伪，考虑到由坐标广播到恒星毁灭的时间跨度，这种可能性是相当大的。第二种观点承认该恒星是被光速物体摧毁，但认为光粒可能是银河系中的一种自然现象。虽然迄今为止没有观察到第二个光粒现象，但确实观察到大质量物体被自然力量加速到极高速度的例子，曾经观测到有恒星被星团的引力以极高速度甩出银河系，有学者认为，银河系中心的超级黑洞完全有可能把小质量物体加速到极接近光速，这种光速物体可能在银心大量产生，只是由于其体积很小难以发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For sixty-some years -- the entirety of the Deterrence Era -- dark forest theory formed the backdrop to human history. But scholars had always questioned it, and until the start of the Broadcast Era, there had never been any scientific proof for its validity. The existing few pieces of evidence all lacked rigorous scientific foundation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The second piece of evidence: the terror Trisolaris showed for dark forest deterrence. This was, to date, the most convincing proof for dark forest theory, but humanity knew nothing of the Trisolarans' own process of derivation and the evidence they relied on; so, scientifically speaking, it was insufficient to constitute direct proof. It was possible that Trisolaris submitted to a state of deterrence balance with humanity for some other unknown reason, and finally gave up the conquest of the Solar System. Many hypotheses were proposed to explain this unknown reason, and although none were absolutely convincing, none could be conclusively disproven, either. Some scholars proposed a new theory of "delusions of cosmic persecution," which argued that the Trisolarans also had no proof of the validity of dark forest theory. However, due to the extremely harsh environment they had evolved in, the Trisolarans suffered a mass persecution complex against cosmic society. This persecution delusion was similar to Medieval religions on the Earth, and was merely a faith held by a majority of Trisolarans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="疑点二：三体世界对黑暗森林威恨的恐惧。这是迄今为止对黑暗森林理论最有力的证明，但三体世界本身所掌握的证据和其论证的过程一直不得而知，所以在科学上也无法被视为直接的证明。三体世界有可能因为别的未知原因同人类建立起威慑平衡，并且最终放弃对太阳系的占领。对这种未知原因的假说有许多种，虽然没有一种有绝对的说服力，但也都无法证伪。还有学者提出一种“宇宙迫害妄想”学说，认为三体世界本身也并没有掌握黑暗森林理论的确切证据，只是由于其长期所处的极端险恶的环境，使其对宇宙社会产生了一种群体的迫害妄想，这种群体妄想类似于地球中世纪的宗教，被大多数三体人信以为真。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The third piece of evidence: the confirmation of dark forest theory given by the four-dimensional Ring. Clearly, the Ring had obtained the words "dark forest" from the Rosetta System, specifically the section discussing human history. This phrase appeared often in historical records dating from the Deterrence Era, and it was not surprising that the Ring would use it. However, in the dialogue between the Ring and the exploration team, the section where the concept was invoked was very brief and its exact meaning ambiguous. It was not enough to conclude that the Ring really understood the meaning of the words it used.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since the Deterrence Era, the study of dark forest theory had developed into its own subject. Other than theoretical research, scholars also conducted large numbers of astronomical observations and built numerous mathematical models. But for most scholars, the theory remained a hypothesis that could be neither confirmed nor disproven. Dark forest theory's true believers were the politicians and the public, and members of the public mostly chose to believe or disbelieve based on their own situations. After the commencement of the Broadcast Era, more and more people leaned toward treating dark forest theory as merely a delusion of cosmic persecution.</div>

<div class="line_en">The election had been a complicated process -- public opinion had turned into political pressure exerted on the UN and Fleet International. The public vigorously debated who was ultimately responsible, but almost no one suggested that it was the result dictated by the herd mentality of all involved. Public opinion was relatively forgiving to Cheng Xin herself. Her positive public image provided some measure of protection, and her suffering as an ordinary person during the Great Resettlement gained her some sympathy. Most people tended to think she was also a victim.</div>

Although her internal pain was no longer searing and heart-rending, there also was no end in sight. Suffering and depression seemed to suffuse every cell in her body, and she could no longer recall the presence of sunlight in her life.

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin recognized the star. For almost three centuries, humans had looked at it more than at any other spot in the heavens.</div>

<div class="line_en">The star now began to fade. From white it gradually dimmed to red, and about half an hour later, it went out.</div>

<div class="line_en">A lovely dream had ended: Dark forest theory had received its final confirmation with the annihilation of Trisolaris.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin hadn't brought the phone with her, but the floating communication window had followed her. She could still hear Fraisse's voice, which had recovered its usual serenity and transcendence. "Child, don't be afraid. What will happen, will happen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心出来时没拿电话，但通话窗口跟随着她，她仍能听到弗雷斯的声音，这声音又恢复了沉稳和超然：“孩子，不要怕，该发生的总要发生。”安逸的美梦彻底破灭，黑暗森林理论得到了最后的证实，三体世界被摧毁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Trisolaris was shattered three years and ten months after the start of the Broadcast Era. No one had expected the attack to come so soon after the gravitational wave broadcast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三体世界应该是在广播纪元三年零十个月被摧毁的。引力波宇宙广播后这么短的时间就引来了打击，这出乎所有人的预抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since Trisolaris had always been under intense surveillance, plenty of data was captured concerning its extinction. The attack on the Trisolaran system was identical to the attack on Luo Ji's 187J3X1: A small object traveling near the speed of light struck one of the three stars in the system and destroyed it through its relativistically amplified mass. At the time, Trisolaris had just started to revolve around the star, and the stellar explosion annihilated the planet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于三体星系一直处于密切监视之中，所以对这次事件掌握了较为详细的资料。三体星系受到的打击与罗娜进行试验的187J3X1恒星受到的打击完全一样：是一个极端接近光速的小体积物体，借助于相时论效应产生的质量膨胀摧毁恒星。被摧毁的是三体星系三星中的一颗。时机选择得很精确。这颗恒星被击中时，刚刚捕获了三体行星成为它的卫星，恒星爆发时行星被完全摧毁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When it made the gravitational wave broadcast, Gravity was about three light-years from Trisolaris. Taking into account the lightspeed propagation of gravitational waves, the photoid must have been launched from a point that was even closer to Trisolaris than Gravity -- and the launch must have been practically instantaneous after receiving the coordinates. Observations confirmed this: The trail of the photoid traversing the interstellar dust cloud near Trisolaris was clearly recorded, but there were no other solar systems within this zone of space -- the only conclusion was that the photoid had been launched from a spacecraft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当它发出引力波时，引力距离三体星大约3光年。考虑到引力波的光速传播，光速必须是从一个比重力更接近三体的点发射的，而且在接收到坐标后，发射必须是瞬时的。观测结果证实了这一点：在三太阳附近的星际尘埃云上清晰地记录到了光体的轨迹，但在这一空间区域内没有其他太阳系——唯一的结论是，光体是从航天器上发射的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old model for dark forest theory had always assumed planetary systems around stars as the foundation. People simply assumed that attacks on systems whose coordinates had been exposed must come from other planetary systems. But once the possibility of attacks from spacecraft entered the scene, the situation became far more complex. While the locations of stars were relatively well known, humans had no information at all concerning spacecraft made by other intelligences -- save for the Trisolaran Fleet. How many extraterrestrial spaceships were there? How densely were they deployed in space? How fast did they fly? What were their headings? There were no answers to these questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗森林理论以前的模型主要是以恒星系为基础的，人们想当然地认为，对坐标已经被广播的恒星系的打击，都是来自于其他恒星系。如果宇宙飞行器也能够成为打击源，情况便骤然复杂起来。相较于对恒星位置的精确掌握，除三体舰队外，人类根本没有任何关于其他智能体制造的宇宙飞船的信息。有多少艘外星宇宙飞船？它们在太空的部署密度有多大？他们飞得多快？他们的标题是什么？这些问题没有答案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The possible sources of dark forest attacks could no longer be predicted, and the attacks might come much faster than previously imagined. Other than the surviving stars of the Trisolaran system, the nearest star was six light-years from the Solar System. But the ghostlike alien spaceships could be, at that moment, passing next to the Sun. Death, once only a figure on the horizon, now loomed before our eyes.</div>
