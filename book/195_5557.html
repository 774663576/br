<div class="line_en">Philip expected to find a letter from Norah when he got back to his rooms, but there was nothing; nor did he receive one the following morning. The silence irritated and at the same time alarmed him. They had seen one another every day he had been in London since the previous June; and it must seem odd to her that he should let two days go by without visiting her or offering a reason for his absence; he wondered whether by an unlucky chance she had seen him with Mildred. He could not bear to think that she was hurt or unhappy, and he made up his mind to call on her that afternoon. He was almost inclined to reproach her because he had allowed himself to get on such intimate terms with her. The thought of continuing them filled him with disgust.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he forced himself to go to Vincent Square. He was sick with apprehension when he rang the bell. He had an uneasy sense that he was treating Norah badly; he dreaded reproaches; he knew she had a quick temper, and he hated scenes: perhaps the best way would be to tell her frankly that Mildred had come back to him and his love for her was as violent as it had ever been; he was very sorry, but he had nothing to offer Norah any more. Then he thought of her anguish, for he knew she loved him; it had flattered him before, and he was immensely grateful; but now it was horrible. She had not deserved that he should inflict pain upon her. He asked himself how she would greet him now, and as he walked up the stairs all possible forms of her behaviour flashed across his mind. He knocked at the door. He felt that he was pale, and wondered how to conceal his nervousness.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went through an elaborate form of stamping his foot and walking about. Then he stood in front of the fire so that she should not resume her position. While she talked he thought that she was worth ten of Mildred; she amused him much more and was jollier to talk to; she was cleverer, and she had a much nicer nature. She was a good, brave, honest little woman; and Mildred, he thought bitterly, deserved none of these epithets. If he had any sense he would stick to Norah, she would make him much happier than he would ever be with Mildred: after all she loved him, and Mildred was only grateful for his help. But when all was said the important thing was to love rather than to be loved; and he yearned for Mildred with his whole soul. He would sooner have ten minutes with her than a whole afternoon with Norah, he prized one kiss of her cold lips more than all Norah could give him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew that he would not be able to come, since he was going to help Mildred with her moving, but he had not the courage to say so. He made up his mind that he would send a wire. Mildred saw the rooms in the morning, was satisfied with them, and after luncheon Philip went up with her to Highbury. She had a trunk for her clothes and another for the various odds and ends, cushions, lampshades, photograph frames, with which she had tried to give the apartments a home-like air; she had two or three large cardboard boxes besides, but in all there was no more than could be put on the roof of a four-wheeler. As they drove through Victoria Street Philip sat well back in the cab in case Norah should happen to be passing. He had not had an opportunity to telegraph and could not do so from the post office in the Vauxhall Bridge Road, since she would wonder what he was doing in that neighbourhood; and if he was there he could have no excuse for not going into the neighbouring square where she lived. He made up his mind that he had better go in and see her for half an hour; but the necessity irritated him: he was angry with Norah, because she forced him to vulgar and degrading shifts. But he was happy to be with Mildred. It amused him to help her with the unpacking; and he experienced a charming sense of possession in installing her in these lodgings which he had found and was paying for. He would not let her exert herself. It was a pleasure to do things for her, and she had no desire to do what somebody else seemed desirous to do for her. He unpacked her clothes and put them away. She was not proposing to go out again, so he got her slippers and took off her boots. It delighted him to perform menial offices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他明知第二天要去帮米尔德里德搬家，不可能再来找她了，但没有勇气道出实情。他决定要给诺拉发电报，把事情讲清楚。第二天，米尔德里德一早就看了房间，很是满意。吃过午饭后，菲利普跟着她回了海布里。她有一箱子衣服，一箱子坐垫、灯罩、相框之类的小零碎。她打算用这些东西营造一种家的感觉。除此之外，还有两三个大纸箱，不过全都放到一辆四轮马车顶上也还是绰绰有余。马车沿着维多利亚大街行驶，菲利普坐在车里使劲往后靠，唯恐诺拉刚好经过瞅见自己。今天早些时候，他一直没腾出空来给她去电报。等到了沃克斯豪尔桥大街，也不方便在那里的邮局发电报了，因为她一定会纳闷：他在附近做些什么？既然都来了，怎么不到旁边的文森特广场找她？他决定了，过一会儿就去看她，和她在一起待半个钟头。可这种不得不做的压迫感让他心里窝火：正是诺拉害得他变成了一个庸俗不堪的可耻小人！和米尔德里德在一起，他觉得很幸福。帮着整理整理行李，心里就跟喝了蜜似的甜。把她安置在这间自己找的、付了房租的屋子里，好像就对她有了种占有感，这微妙的感觉让人颇为着迷。他不能把她累坏了，心甘情愿地给她帮这忙那。而只要是别人愿意给她干的事，米尔德里德就绝对不会抢来做。他把衣服从箱子里取出来放好，看她不打算出门了，就给她拿出拖鞋，脱了靴子。像个奴隶一样地为她忙碌，反倒让他觉得心花怒放。">查看中文翻译</div>
