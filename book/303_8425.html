<div class="line_en">Emotional independence doesn't mean that you have to cut yourself off from your parents. It means that you can be part of the family while at the same time being a separate individual. It means you can be who you are and let your parents be who they are.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When you feel free to have your own beliefs, feelings, and behaviors, apart from those of your parents (or others), you are "self-defined." If your parents don't like what you do or think, inevitably you will have to tolerate some discomfort. And you'll have to tolerate their discomfort with you when you don't rush in to change yourself for them. Even if some of your beliefs are identical to those of your parents, or your behavior meets with their approval, it is essential that you make your own choices and that you feel free to agree or disagree with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This doesn't mean I encourage you to ride roughshod over other people's feelings or to ignore the impact that your behavior may have on them. But neither can you allow them to ride roughshod over you. We all have to find a balance between taking care of ourselves and being concerned about the feelings of others.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one can be self-defined 100 percent of the time. We are all part of a larger society. No one is totally free from the desire for approval from others. No one is completely free from emotional dependency of some kind, and very few of us would want to be. Human beings are social animals, and open relationships demand a certain amount of emotional interdependence. For this reason, self-definition must be somewhat flexible. There's nothing wrong with making a compromise for your parents, as long as it is something you've chosen to do of your own free will. What I'm talking about here is maintaining your emotional integrity, being true to yourself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many people don't stand up for themselves because they confuse self-definition with selfishness. The word selfish pushes all of our guilt buttons. Sandy -- the hairdresser whose unforgiving parents continued to punish her in adulthood for the abortion she had had when she was 15-- put herself through an emotional hell to avoid being labeled selfish. She explained:</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">I suggested that Sandy use this minicrisis as an opportunity to begin the process of self-definition. It was time for her to take a look at the current uproar and see it not as an isolated incident but as the latest problem in an ongoing pattern in her relationship with her parents. This wasn't about their moving in with her, it was about her automatic reaction of placating and accommodating them. If she wanted to break that pattern, she had to focus first on what she wanted as opposed to what her parents were demanding of her. I asked her if she even knew what she wanted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Talk about being between a rock and a hard place. I think I may have just ruined my entire life. My folks are having their house remodeled, and my mother called me last week to tell me that the noise is driving her crazy, so she and Dad want to move in with us until the remodeling is done, which could be weeks. I really didn't want to say "yes," but what could I do? I mean they are my parents. When my husband found out, he just about died. See, he uses the spare room as an office and he's in the middle of a big project right now. So he made me call my mother back and suggest that maybe it would be better for her and Dad to go to a hotel instead. Well, she just about went through the ceiling. I got a half hour on how ungrateful and selfish I am, how this is the least I can do, considering everything they've done for me. I told her I'd have to discuss it with Bill, but I already know what he'll say. What can I do, Susan?</div>

<div class="line_en">SANDY: The first thing that comes to mind is I want my parents to leave me alone. I don't want them to stay with us. It'll be horrible. I mean, I feel guilty just even admitting that, because kids are supposed to be there for their parents. Maybe I'll just tell them they can stay. Then I won't feel so awful about it. It's a lot easier fighting with Bill than it is fighting with them. Why can't I make everybody happy?</div>

<div class="line_en">Sandy started to cry. It was so important for her to prove to her mother that she was neither selfish nor ungrateful that she was willing to throw both her home and her marriage into near-pandemonium.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">SUSAN: Sweetie, if you were as good to you as you are to your parents, you probably wouldn't need to be here. You're a very good person -- to everybody but you.</div>

<div class="line_en">SANDY: Then how come I feel so bad?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sandy based many of her life decisions on an overdeveloped sense of obligation to her parents. She believed she had a responsibility to bury her needs beneath theirs. She rarely did what she wanted to do, and this had led to years of repressed anger and lack of personal fulfillment that eventually expressed themselves as depression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sandy, like most of us, reacted to her parents in an almost automatic, knee-jerk way. When we react, we usually act without thinking, without listening, and without exploring our options. People are usually the most reactive when they feel emotionally threatened or assaulted. This reactiveness can take place in a relationship with almost anyone in our lives -- a lover, a boss, a child, or a friend -- but it is almost always the most intense with our parents.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">When you're reactive, you typically say things such as, "Every time my mother tells me how to live my life, I go crazy"; "They really know how to push my buttons, I always lose it with them"; or, "I just have to hear my father's voice and I see red." When you allow your emotional reactions to become automatic, you're giving up control, handing your feelings to someone else on a silver platter. This gives other people enormous power over you.</div>

<div class="line_en">RESPONDING VERSUS REACTING</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The opposite of being reactive is being responsive. When you're being responsive, you are thinking as well as feeling. You're aware of your feelings but you don't let them drive you to act impulsively.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When you are reactive, you are dependent on the approval of others. You feel good about yourself only when no one disagrees with you, criticizes you, or disapproves of you. Your feelings are often far out of proportion to the events that evoked them. You'll perceive a small suggestion as a personal attack; a minor constructive criticism as a personal failure. Without the approval of others, you have a hard time maintaining even minimal emotional stability.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sandy needed to become less reactive and more responsive. I cautioned her that behavioral changes are a struggle for everyone, including myself, but I assured her that she could do it if she was willing to commit to the process. She was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Responsiveness also allows you to maintain your sense of self-worth, despite anything your parents might say about you. This is extremely rewarding. The thoughts and feelings of others no longer drag you into a pit of self-doubt. You will see all sorts of new options and choices in your dealings with other people because your perspective and your sense of reason are not being buried by emotions. Responsiveness can put back into your hands a good deal of your control over your life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing I asked her to do was to recognize that most of her opinions of herself really came from things her parents had told her -- from their definition of her. The negative parts of that definition included labeling Sandy selfish, ungrateful, and bad. It took many years for Sandy to internalize this negative self-image, so we weren't about to change it overnight. But I showed her some beginning behavioral strategies to enable her to begin the process of replacing her parents' definition of her with a more realistic view of who she really was.</div>

<div class="line_en">I told Sandy that she was being defensive. She was still apologizing, arguing, and explaining. She had to stop trying to "get them to see."

<div class="line_en">None of us is taught to respond nondefensively. That's why the technique doesn't come easily. It needs to be learned and practiced. Also, most people assume that if they don't defend themselves in a conflict, their opponents will see them as weak and ride right over them. In reality the opposite is true. If you can stay calm and refuse to be stampeded, then you retain the power.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's important that you rehearse nondefensive responses by yourself before you start using them with others. To do this, imagine your parents in the room with you saying something critical or denigrating. Respond out loud to them nondefensively. Remember, the moment you argue, apologize, explain, or try to get them to change their minds, you have handed over much of your power. If you ask someone to forgive or to understand, you give them the power to withhold what you're asking for. But if you use nondefensive responses, you are asking for nothing, and when you ask for nothing, you can't be rejected.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once you feel somewhat comfortable with nondefensive responses, try using them the next time you have a disagreement with someone other than your parents. It's a good idea to test them out on someone you're less emotionally connected to -- a colleague or a casual friend. It will probably feel awkward and unnatural at first. You may find yourself lapsing back into defensive responses out of frustration. Like any new skill, you'll have to practice and be willing to make mistakes. But eventually it will become second nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Position statements define what you think and believe, what's important to you, what you are willing to do and not willing to do, what's negotiable and what's not. The issues can range in importance from your opinion of a recent film to your basic beliefs about life. Of course, before you can make a position statement, you have to determine what your position is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is another behavioral technique -- I call it "making position statements"-- that can help you become less reactive and propel you further down the road of self-definition.</div>

It's hard to define who you are when you've had little opportunity to do so in the past.

</div>
<div class="line_en">Some people think that if they merely rephrase an unwanted behavior as a choice, instead of changing that behavior, they're admitting defeat. I disagree. I see choice as the key to self-definition. Any decision based on choice moves us away from reactiveness. There is a big difference between choosing to capitulate to your parents because you've considered the alternatives and decided that you're not prepared to fight, and automatically capitulating because you feel helpless. Making a choice means taking a step toward control; knee-jerk reacting means backsliding into being controlled. It may not feel like an enormous amount of progress, but I assure you it is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I haven't yet" implies choice, where "don't" and "can't" imply just the opposite: finality. Lack of choice is directly connected to enmeshment. It is the key to keeping the child locked inside. Children's choices are dictated by adults. By saying, "I haven't yet," you open the door to new behavior in the future. You embrace hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sandy was not completely satisfied with her solution. She was still putting a burden on her husband and on their relationship, and she believed that this was due to her weakness. With a deep sigh, she said, "I guess I just can't stand up to my parents." I asked her to repeat her statement, but instead of saying, "I can't…" say, "I haven't yet stood up to my parents."</div>

<div class="line_en">I suggested to Sandy that she make the most of the time her parents were living with her by practicing nondefensive responses and making position statements about small things. I encouraged her to express her thoughts and opinions. Instead of saying, "You're wrong, shellfish is bad for you," she could say, "I don't happen to agree with you, I think shellfish is bad for you." In that way her position would be framed as an opinion instead of a challenge, reducing the chance of inciting an emotional reaction.</div>

<div class="line_en">I also suggested that if she felt brave enough, she might try to tackle some of the larger problems in her relationship with her parents by setting limits, letting them know what she was and was not willing to do for them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although Sandy felt somewhat apprehensive about the things I was asking her to do, she knew that unless she began to try out some of this new behavior she would stay stuck in her rut. But she was pessimistic about her parents' ability to change. She asked me how she could feel good about her behavioral changes if they didn't work -- if her parents didn't change as a result. I reminded her that they didn't have to change. If she changed her ways of responding to them, she would be single-handedly changing her relationship to them. This could cause them to change, but even if it didn't, Sandy would be tipping the balance of power into her own hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">When you become self-defined -- when you become responsive instead of reactive, when you make clear statements about what you feel and think, when you set limits on what you are and aren't willing to do -- your relationship with your parents will have to change.</div>
