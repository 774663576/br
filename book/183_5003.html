We left Redhaven six days ago and have made marvellously good speed, so that I hope to see the Lone Islands the day after tomorrow.

<div class="line_en">"But you have," said Caspian. "I'd quite forgotten about it. As you left it behind I thought it might be regarded as one of the royal treasures and so I brought it -- if you think it ought to be wasted on a thing like seasickness."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“药还有，”凯斯宾说，“我差点忘了。当初你走的时候留下这药， 我想着，不妨把这药当成一件王室宝贝，所以我一直随身携带——如果你想在晕船这个小毛病上把它浪费掉的话，你就用吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It'll only take a drop," said Lucy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我只要一滴。”露茜说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the deck there were two large, long hatches, fore and aft of the mast, and both open, as they always were in fair weather, to let light and air into the belly of the ship. Caspian led them down a ladder into the after hatch. Here they found themselves in a place where benches for rowing ran from side to side and the light came in through the oarholes and danced on the roof. Of course Caspian's ship was not that horrible thing, a galley rowed by slaves. Oars were used only when wind failed or for getting in and out of harbour and everyone (except Reepicheep whose legs were too short) had often taken a turn. At each side of the ship the space under the benches was left clear for the rowers' feet, but all down the center there was a kind of pit which went down to the very keel and this was filled with all kinds of things -- sacks of flour, casks of water and beer, barrels of pork, jars of honey, skin bottles of wine, apples, nuts, cheeses, biscuits, turnips, sides of bacon. From the roof -- that is, from the under side of the deck -- hung hams and strings of onions, and also the men of the watch off -- duty in their hammocks. Caspian led them aft, stepping from bench to bench; at least, it was stepping for him, and something between a step and a jump for Lucy, and a real long jump for Reepicheep. In this way they came to a partition with a door in it. Caspian opened the door and led them into a cabin which filled the stern underneath the deck cabins in the poop. It was of course not so nice. It was very low and the sides sloped together as they went down so that there was hardly any floor; and though it had windows of thick glass, they were not made to open because they were under water. In fact at this very moment, as the ship pitched they were alternately golden with sunlight and dim green with the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甲板上有两个敞开的舱口盖，又大又长。晴天的时候，水手们总是把它们打开，用来通风和采光。凯斯宾带他们走到梯子下面，进入后面的舱口。他们这才发现，原来左右两边都有划桨的长凳，阳光透过桨孔照进来，在舱顶上闪烁不定。凯斯宾的船不是由奴隶划桨的， 也没有单层甲板大帆船那种可怕的东西。在没风或者进出港口的时候，船桨才会被用到。除了个头矮小的雷佩契普之外，其他人都要轮流划桨。船两边的长凳下都有空地方供划船的人搁脚，中间部分有个深窖，一直通向龙骨处，里面堆满了各种东西，比如很多袋的面粉，很多桶水，很多块猪肉，很多罐蜂蜜，还有很多装满酒的皮囊，以及苹果、坚果、奶酪、饼干、大头菜和熏肉。舱顶，也就是甲板下面， 挂着很多火腿和成捆成捆的大葱。当然，还有个值班人员下班后在里面的吊床上休息。凯斯宾带他们走到船尾，从一个长凳跨到另一个长凳，他的确是名副其实的跨，露茜则是边跳边跨，而对雷佩契普来说， 那就不能称作跨了，简直就是大幅度地跳。就这样，他们走到一块有门的隔板前。凯斯宾打开门，带他们走了进去，这间舱房正好在船尾几间甲板舱下面的尾部，所以条件不太好。房间很低，屋顶根本没有天花板，墙壁都是倾斜着靠在一起的。他们一路走过去，船里一点空隙都没有了。虽然里面有厚厚的玻璃窗， 却打不开，因为它们都在水下。不过，这个时候如果船身前后颠簸， 舱房里就会一下子闪烁着金色的阳光，一下子泛着幽暗的绿光。">查看中文翻译</div>

But he took a drop from her flask, and though he said it was beastly stuff (the smell in the cabin when she opened it was delicious) it is certain that his face came the right colour a few moments after he had swallowed it, and he must have felt better because, instead of wailing about the storm and his head, he began demanding to be put ashore and said that at the first port he would "lodge a disposition" against them all with the British Consul. But when Reepicheep asked what a disposition was and how you lodged it (Reepicheep thought it was some new way of arranging a single combat) Eustace could only reply, "Fancy not knowing that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎呀，都走开，别来烦我。”尤斯塔斯有些疯狂。露茜打开药瓶， 舱房里弥散出一股清香。尽管尤斯塔斯说这是致命的毒药，但他还是喝了一滴。等他喝下药后，脸色明显好转了，相信他也感觉舒服了许多。此刻他不再感到头昏脑胀，也不再提风浪了，只是要求他们把他送到岸上去，他还说只要自己一踏上海港，就向英国领事馆申请对他们所有人做出裁决。雷佩契普以为这是种新的决斗方式，问他裁决是什么、怎样申请时，尤斯塔斯嘲讽道：“你真是太奇怪了，连裁决都不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They went up on the forecastle and saw the look-out man standing on a little shelf inside the gilded dragon's neck and peering through its open mouth. Inside the forecastle was the galley (or ship's kitchen) and quarters for such people as the boatswain, the carpenter, the cook and the master-archer. If you think it odd to have the galley in the bows and imagine the smoke from its chimney streaming back over the ship, that is because you are thinking of steamships where there is always a headwind. On a sailing ship the wind is coming from behind, and anything smelly is put as far forward as possible. They were taken up to the fighting -- top, and at first it was rather alarming to rock to and fro there and see the deck looking small and far away beneath. You realized that if you fell there was no particular reason why you should fall on board rather than in the sea. Then they were taken to the poop, where Rhince was on duty with another man at the great tiller, and behind that the dragon's tail rose up, covered with gilding, and round inside it ran a little bench. The name of the ship was Dawn Treader. She was only a little bit of a thing compared with one of our ships, or even with the cogs, dromonds, carracks and galleons which Narnia had owned when Lucy and Edmund had reigned there under Peter as the High King, for nearly all navigation had died out in the reigns of Caspian's ancestors. When his uncle, Miraz the usurper, had sent the seven lords to sea, they had had to buy a Galmian ship and man it with hired Galmian sailors. But now Caspian had begun to teach the Narnians to be sea-faring folk once more, and the Dawn Treader was the finest ship he had built yet. She was so small that, forward of the mast, there was hardly any deck room between the central hatch and the ship's boat on one side and the hen-coop (Lucy fed the hens) on the other. But she was a beauty of her kind, a "lady" as sailors say, her lines perfect, her colours pure, and every spar and rope and pin lovingly made. Eustace of course would be pleased with nothing, and kept on boasting about liners and motor boats and aeroplanes and submarines ("As if he knew anything about them," muttered Edmund), but the other two were delighted with the Dawn Treader, and when they returned aft to the cabin and supper, and saw the whole western sky lit up with an immense crimson sunset, and felt the quiver of the ship, and tasted the salt on their lips, and thought of unknown lands on the Eastern rim of the world, Lucy felt that she was almost too happy to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾带他们到甲板上参观整艘船，事实上，他们已经参观过一大半了。他们登上第一个阁楼，看到瞭望员站在镀金龙头旁的一个小木架上，从张开的龙嘴向外张望。阁楼里有厨房（或者说船上的厨房），还有水手、木匠、厨子，以及弓箭手头头儿的住处。如果你认为烟囱的烟是向后飘，觉得厨房在前面很奇怪的话，你就要知道， 所有的轮船都是逆风行驶的。事实上，帆船是靠后面的风推动而行， 那样的话所有的尾气和炊烟都会被吹到前面，所以厨房只能设在帆船的前面。他们到桅杆顶的观测台，起初那里晃得厉害，过了好一会才稳住了，从那儿往下看，甲板看起来又小又远。那种感觉自然是惊心动魄的。你想啊，万一掉了下去，肯定不会掉到海里，毫无疑问，只能掉到甲板上。然后他们又去了船尾，赖因斯和另一个水手正在值班掌舵，舵后面的龙尾是翘着的，上面镀着金粉，半圆形的船尾内有一排小凳子。这艘船被命名为“黎明踏浪号”。跟我们这里的船比起来，真是小巫见大巫，它甚至跟彼得国王、露茜和爱德蒙统治纳尼亚王国时的单桅船、双桅船、大帆船等任何一条船都没法比。不知为何，从凯斯宾时代起，几乎所有的航海事业都消亡了。所以当初凯斯宾的叔父， 那个篡夺王位的弥若兹国王把七位公爵派去出海时，只好买了一艘加尔马的船只，并雇佣了加尔马的水手。现在凯斯宾开始鼓励纳尼亚人学习造船技术并出海了。迄今为止，黎明踏浪号是他们建造出来的最优秀的船只。这条船，结构小巧，一边是救生艇，另一边是露茜的鸡棚（露茜养了一些母鸡），中间剩下的地方就不多了。其实它的确算得上是同类船中的“美人儿”了，水手称她是一位“小姐”，因为船的外形很美，颜色纯净，甚至每根桅杆、每条缆绳、每只圆钉的做工都很精美。尤斯塔斯对他们说的一概没有兴趣，一个人自顾自地吹嘘大客轮、汽艇、飞机和潜水艇（爱德蒙暗自说：“就像他真的无所不知似的。”）。露茜和爱德蒙两个人对黎明踏浪号非常喜欢。在他们从船尾回到舱里吃饭的时候，看见西边的天空出现了一大片玫瑰色的晚霞。船身在前进中不停地颤动，似乎海水的咸味已经到了嘴边。想到马上就要到达世界最东方之外的那片未知地了，露茜觉得幸福得说不出话来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end they succeeded in convincing Eustace that they were already sailing as fast as they could towards the nearest land they knew, and that they had no more power of sending him back to Cambridge -- which was where Uncle Harold lived -- than of sending him to the moon. After that he sulkily agreed to put on the fresh clothes which had been put out for him and come on deck.</div>

<div class="line_en">What Eustace thought had best be told in his own words, for when they all got their clothes back, dried, next morning, he at once got out a little black notebook and a pencil and started to keep a diary. He always had this notebook with him and kept a record of his marks in it, for though he didn't care much about any subject for its own sake, he cared a great deal about marks and would even go to people and say, "I got so much. What did you get?" But as he didn't seem likely to get many marks on the Dawn Treader he now started a diary. This was the first entry.</div>

<div class="line_en">"7 August. Have now been twenty-four hours on this ghastly boat if it isn't a dream. All the time a frightful storm has been raging (it's a good thing I'm not seasick). Huge waves keep coming in over the front and I have seen the boat nearly go under any number of times. All the others pretend to take no notice of this, either from swank or because Harold says one of the most cowardly things ordinary people do is to shut their eyes to Facts. It's madness to come out into the sea in a rotten little thing like this. Not much bigger than a lifeboat. And, of course, absolutely primitive indoors. No proper saloon, no radio, no bathrooms, no deck-chairs. I was dragged all over it yesterday evening and it would make anyone sick to hear Caspian showing off his funny little toy boat as if it was the Queen Mary. I tried to tell him what real ships are like, but he's too dense. E. and L., of course, didn't back me up. I suppose a kid like L. doesn't realize the danger and E. is buttering up C. as everyone does here. They call him a King. I said I was a Republican but he had to ask me what that meant! He doesn't seem to know anything at all. Needless to say I've been put in the worst cabin of the boat, a perfect dungeon, and Lucy has been given a whole room on deck to herself, almost a nice room compared with the rest of this place. C. says that's because she's a girl. I tried to make him see what Alberta says, that all that sort of thing is really lowering girls but he was too dense. Still, he might see that I shall be ill if I'm kept in that hole any longer. E. says we mustn't grumble because C. is sharing it with us himself to make room for L. As if that didn't make it more crowded and far worse. Nearly forgot to say that there is also a kind of Mouse thing that gives everyone the most frightful cheek. The others can put up with it if they like but I shall twist his tail pretty soon if he tries it on me. The food is frightful too."</div>

<div class="line_en">What had really happened was this. Reepicheep, who never felt that the ship was getting on fast enough, loved to sit on the bulwarks far forward just beside the dragon's head, gazing out at the eastern horizon and singing softly in his little chirruping voice the song the Dryad had made for him. He never held on to anything, however the ship pitched, and kept his balance with perfect ease; perhaps his long tail, hanging down to the deck inside the bulwarks, made this easier. Everyone on board was familiar with this habit, and the sailors liked it because when one was on look-out duty it gave one somebody to talk to.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first the plan seemed to work beautifully. The Mouse was not much heavier than a very large cat. Eustace had him off the rail in a trice and very silly he looked (thought Eustace) with his little limbs all splayed out and his mouth open. But unfortunately Reepicheep, who had fought for his life many a time, never lost his head even for a moment. Nor his skill. It is not very easy to draw one's sword when one is swinging round in the air by one's tail, but he did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初这个计划进行得很顺利。这只老鼠并不比一只猫大多少， 尤斯塔斯轻而易举地就把它扔到了栏杆外面。只见它张着嘴，四肢仰面朝天，尤斯塔斯觉得这样的丑相真是狼狈至极。没想到，雷佩契普多次拼死奋战，一点都没有惊慌失措，并抓住了机会扭转了败局。按理说，被人扭住尾巴，身体在空中摇摆是不可能拔出剑来的，可它却做到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the next thing Eustace knew was two agonizing jabs in his hand which made him let go of the tail; and the next thing after that was that the Mouse had picked itself up again as if it were a ball bouncing off the deck, and there it was facing him, and a horrid long, bright, sharp thing like a skewer was waving to and fro within an inch of his stomach.(This doesn't count as below the belt for mice in Narnia because they can hardly be expected to reach higher.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤斯塔斯不知不觉就被砍了两剑，痛得他只好松开雷佩契普的尾巴。然后，那只老鼠在甲板上打了个滚之后爬了起来，用那支明晃晃的剑对准了尤斯塔斯，并在他的肚子前一两寸的地方来回挥舞。（这对纳尼亚的老鼠来说，不能看成是袭击腰部以下的违规行为，因为老鼠只能够得到那个位置。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why exactly Eustace had slipped and reeled and stumbled all the way forward to the forecastle (he had not yet got his sea-legs) I never heard. Perhaps he hoped he would see land, or perhaps he wanted to hang about the galley and scrounge something. Anyway, as soon as he saw that long tail hanging down -- and perhaps it was rather tempting -- he thought it would be delightful to catch hold of it, swing Reepicheep round by it once or twice upside-down, then run away and laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道尤斯塔斯为什么一路上摇摇晃晃，磕磕碰碰地摸到船头（他还是晕船）。可能他想看看是不是能看见陆地，或许他想去厨房外面的走廊逛逛，看看能否找点东西吃吧。反正，只要他看见那条长尾巴拖在地上——这个想法太诱人了——他马上就想一把抓住那条尾巴，把雷佩契普头朝下扭上一两圈，自己赶快溜走，躲在一旁偷笑， 真是大快人心啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

Eustace (of course) was at a school where they didn't have corporal punishment, so the sensation was quite new to him. That was why, in spite of having no sea -- legs, it took him less than a minute to get off that forecastle and cover the whole length of the deck and burst in at the cabin door -- still hotly pursued by Reepicheep. Indeed it seemed to Eustace that the rapier as well as the pursuit was hot. It might have been red -- hot by the feel.</div>
