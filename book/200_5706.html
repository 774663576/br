<div class="line_en">Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic -- and still no one was telling him what was going on.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness. His back ached from hauling Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利走进黑暗的卧室，来到书桌前，立刻把这几句话抄在三张羊皮纸上。第一封信写给小天狼星，第二封信写给罗恩，第三封信写给赫敏。他的猫头鹰海德薇出去捕食了，空空的笼子放在桌上。哈利在卧室里踱来踱去，等着她回来。他脑袋嗡嗡作响，尽管累得眼睛又疼又涩，但思绪一片混乱，根本不可能睡觉。刚才把达力一路拖回家，现在后背疼得厉害；在这之前脑袋被窗户撞了一下，又挨了达力一拳，这时两个肿包一跳一跳地疼着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn't possibly ignore a Dementor attack. He'd probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to The Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们肯定会很快给他回音的。他们不可能对摄魂怪的攻击无动于衷。没准儿他明天一早醒来，就会看到三封厚厚的信，里面写满了对他的同情，以及安排他立刻转移到陋居的计划。这个想法令他放宽了心，睡意随之袭来，淹没了所有的思绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Hedwig didn't return next morning. Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat-flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise, the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn't see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry he'd perform more illegal magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，第二天早晨海德薇没有回来。哈利一整天都待在自己的卧室里，只有上厕所时才出去一下。佩妮姨妈一天三次把饭菜通过那扇小活板门塞进他的房间，那还是弗农姨父在三年前的夏天装上的。哈利每次听见佩妮姨妈的脚步声走近，都想问问她那封吼叫信是怎么回事，但这些问题与其问她，还不如去问那只门把手呢。除了送饭，德思礼一家人从不走近他的卧室。哈利也觉得硬跟他们待在一起没有什么意思。再大吵大闹一番不会有任何收获，大概只会惹得自己勃然大怒，忍不住违反法律动用魔法，一错再错。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She took off immediately. The moment she'd gone, Harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he'd been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at number four, Privet Drive. But he'd make it up to her when she came back with the answers from Sirius, Ron and Hermione.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海德薇立刻出发了。它刚一离开，哈利连衣服都没脱就一头倒在床上，眼睛呆呆地凝视着天花板。现在除了其他痛苦的感觉外，他还为自己刚才对海德薇恶劣的态度感到内疚。它是他在女贞路4号惟一的朋友。不过，等它拿到小天狼星、罗恩和赫敏的回信回来时，他会好好补偿它的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged… Might he be able to move into Sirius's house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry? Would Harry be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him? Had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他们的判决对他不利怎么办呢？如果他真的被开除，魔杖被折断成两截怎么办呢？他将怎么做？他将去哪里？他不可能再像以前那样整天跟德思礼一家生活在一起了，因为他现在已经知道了另一个世界，一个真正属于他的世界。那么，他能不能搬到小天狼星那里去呢？一年前，小天狼星被迫逃避魔法部的追捕之前，曾经提出过这样的建议。现在哈利还没有成年，他们会允许他独自住在那里吗？还是他以后住在哪里的问题也将由别人替他做决定？难道他违反《国际保密法》的行为这么严重，使得他不得不到阿兹卡班去坐牢？每次一想到这儿，哈利总忍不住从床上爬起来，又在房间里踱来踱去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So it went on for three whole days. Harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which time he paced his bedroom, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种情况整整持续了三天。有时候哈利焦躁不安，根本不能静下心来做任何事情，只是在卧室里踱来踱去，为他们所有的人让他在这里忍受煎熬而气愤。有时候他又完全无精打采，整小时整小时地躺在床上，眼睛失神地望着空中，因为想到要去魔法部受审而惶恐不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry looked slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海德薇离开后的第四个夜晚，哈利正处于无精打采的状态，躺在床上，眼睛瞪着天花板，疲倦的大脑里几乎一片空白，这时弗农姨父走进了他的卧室。哈利慢慢转过脸来望着他。弗农姨父穿着他那套最好的西装，一副得意洋洋的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon's footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗农姨父朝哈利瞪着眼睛，显然怀疑哈利这样听话有些不对头。然后他踏着沉重的脚步走出房间，回手把门关上了。哈利听见钥匙在锁眼里转动，又听见弗农姨父的脚步嗵嗵嗵地下楼去了。几分钟后，他听见了重重地关车门声，发动机隆隆作响，还听见了汽车驶出车道的确切无疑的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he'd been fantasising about all summer, he was going home… For a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to recede to nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards: he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon's car… The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent Lawn Competition… and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy.</div>
