<div class="line_en">I'd come to BYU to study music, so that one day I could direct a church choir. But that semester -- the fall of my junior year -- I didn't enroll in a single music course. I couldn't have explained why I dropped advanced music theory in favor of geography and comparative politics, or gave up sight-singing to take History of the Jews. But when I'd seen those courses in the catalog, and read their titles aloud, I had felt something infinite, and I wanted a taste of that infinity.</div>

<div class="line_en">For four months I attended lectures on geography and history and politics. I learned about Margaret Thatcher and the Thirty-Eighth Parallel and the Cultural Revolution; I learned about parliamentary politics and electoral systems around the world. I learned about the Jewish diaspora and the strange history of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. By the end of the semester the world felt big, and it was hard to imagine returning to the mountain, to a kitchen, or even to a piano in the room next to the kitchen.</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew someone must have the answer so I decided to ask one of my professors. I chose the professor of my Jewish history class, because he was quiet and soft-spoken. Dr. Kerry was a short man with dark eyes and a serious expression. He lectured in a thick wool jacket even in hot weather. I knocked on his office door quietly, as if I hoped he wouldn't answer, and soon was sitting silently across from him. I didn't know what my question was, and Dr. Kerry didn't ask. Instead he posed general questions -- about my grades, what courses I was taking. He asked why I'd chosen Jewish history, and without thinking I blurted that I'd learned of the Holocaust only a few semesters before and wanted to learn the rest of the story.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been six months since the explosion, and while Dad was back on his feet, it was clear he would never be the man he was. He could scarcely walk across a room without gasping for air, so damaged were his lungs. The skin on his lower face had regrown, but it was thin and waxy, as if someone had taken sandpaper and rubbed it to the point of transparency. His ears were thick with scars. He had thin lips and his mouth drooped, giving him the haggard appearance of a much older man. But it was his right hand, more than his face, that drew stares: each finger was frozen in its own pose, some curled, some bowed, twisting together into a gnarled claw. He could hold a spoon by wedging it between his index finger, which bowed upward, and his ring finger, which curved downward, but he ate with difficulty. Still, I wondered whether skin grafts could have achieved what Mother had with her comfrey and lobelia salve. It was a miracle, everyone said, so that was the new name they gave Mother's recipe: after Dad's burn it was known as Miracle Salve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爆炸已经过去了六个月，爸爸重新站了起来，显然他再也比不上从前了。他的肺部严重受损，在家稍一走动便气喘吁吁。他下半部分的脸重新长出薄薄一层蜡一般的皮肤，好像被人用砂纸打磨到透明。他的耳朵布满了伤疤。他的嘴唇变薄，嘴巴耷拉着，让他看上去像一个更加苍老的人一样憔悴。但比他的脸更引人侧目的是他的右手：每一根手指都很僵硬，有的蜷曲着，有的弯折着，凑在一起就是一个粗糙的爪子。他能自己拿勺子，把勺子挤进向上弯的食指和向下扭的无名指之间，吃起东西来非常费力。尽管如此，我想知道植皮手术能否取得母亲的紫草和半边莲药膏的效果。人人都赞叹这是个奇迹，所以爸爸烧伤后，他们给母亲的药膏取了个新名字：奇迹药膏。">查看中文翻译</div>

She was standing at the kitchen counter straining herbs, along with half a dozen other women.

She was quiet to the point of invisibility, and after a few minutes, I forgot she was there.</div>

<div class="line_en">At dinner my first night on the peak, Dad described the explosion as a tender mercy from the Lord. "It was a blessing," he said. "A miracle. God spared my life and extended to me a great calling. To testify of His power. To show people there's another way besides the Medical Establishment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回家后第一天吃晚饭时，爸爸将爆炸描述为一种来自上帝的仁慈。“这是一种祝福，”他说，“一个奇迹。上帝饶恕了我的命，赐予我一个伟大的使命，让我为他的力量作证，让世人知道，除了医疗机构还有另一种方式。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I watched the women throughout the morning and became aware of the change my father's miracle had wrought in them. Before, the women who worked for my mother had always approached her casually, with matter-of-fact questions about their work. Now their speech was soft, admiring. Dramas broke out between them as they vied for my mother's esteem, and for my father's. The change could be summed up simply: before, they had been employees; now they were followers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个上午我都看着这些女人，意识到父亲的奇迹给她们带来的变化。以前，为母亲工作的女人们总是随意地走近她，向她咨询工作上的实际问题。现在她们言语轻柔，充满钦佩。她们争相想得到我父母的重视，场面颇为戏剧性。这种变化可以简单地概括为：以前，他们是雇员；现在，他们变成了追随者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning when I came out for breakfast, there was a crowd of women gathered around my father. They listened with hushed voices and glistening eyes as Dad told of the heavenly visitations he'd received while hovering between life and death. He had been ministered to by angels, he said, like the prophets of old. There was something in the way the women looked at him. Something like adoration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，我出来吃早餐时，一群妇女聚在爸爸周围。她们安静地听他讲述自己生死徘徊时所受的上天的眷顾，眼睛闪闪发光。他说自己曾受天使侍奉，就像古代的先知一样。女人们看着他的眼神中有某种东西，像是崇拜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我看着他努力夹紧刀子去切烤肉，但没有成功。“我从没遇到过任何危险，”他说，“我会证明给你们看。只要我能穿过院子而不至于昏过去，我就会拿起割炬，再去卸个油箱看看。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first time, my parents seemed to be of one mind. Mother no longer moderated Dad's statements after he left the room, no longer quietly gave her own opinion. She had been transformed by the miracle -- transformed into him. I remembered her as a young midwife, so cautious, so meek about the lives over which she had such power. There was little of that meekness in her now. The Lord Himself guided her hands, and no misfortune would occur except by the will of God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父母的看法似乎首次达成了一致。父亲离开房间后，母亲不再纠正他的陈述，不再轻声发表自己的意见。她已被奇迹改变——变成了他的样子。我记得她还是个年轻的助产士时，即便自己有那样的能力，对待手中的生命还是那么谨慎、那么温柔。现在她身上的那种温柔消失了。耶和华亲自引导她的手，不会有不幸发生，除非那是上帝的旨意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The story of Dad's burn had become something of a founding myth: it was told over and over, to newcomers but also to the old. In fact, it was rare to spend an afternoon in the house without hearing some kind of recitation of the miracle, and occasionally these recitations were less than accurate. I heard Mother tell a room of devoted faces that sixty-five percent of Dad's upper body had been burned to the third degree. That was not what I remembered. In my memory the bulk of the damage had been skin-deep -- his arms, back and shoulders had hardly been burned at all. It was only his lower face and hands that had been third-degree. But I kept this to myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲被烧伤的故事已经变成一个神话：它被一遍又一遍地讲给新员工听，也讲给老员工听。事实上，只要在房子里待一下午，肯定会听见对这个奇迹的某种讲述，而这些讲述有时并不准确。一次我听母亲对着一屋子虔诚的面孔说，爸爸上半身有百分之六十五的面积是严重的三度烧伤。我记得不是这样。在我记忆中，大部分只是表面伤，他的胳膊、后背和肩膀几乎没有受伤，只有手和脸的下半部分是三度烧伤。但我没有告诉别人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My father drove; the storm raged. In Idaho we call it a whiteout: when the wind whips the snowfall so violently it bleaches the road, covers it as if with a veil, and you can't see the asphalt, or the fields or rivers; you can't see anything except billows of white. Somehow, skidding through snow and sleet, they made it to town, but the hospital there was rural, unequipped to care for such a faint whimper of life. The doctors said they had to get him to McKay-Dee in Ogden as soon as possible, there was no time. He could not go by chopper because of the blizzard, so the doctors sent him in an ambulance. In fact they sent two ambulances, a second in case the first succumbed to the storm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我父亲开车。暴风雪肆虐。在爱达荷州，我们称之为“乳白天空”：狂风猛烈地拍打着雪花，将道路覆盖成全白，就像蒙上一层面纱，让人看不见柏油路，看不见田野，也看不见河流；除了皑皑白雪，什么也看不见。他们在风雪中打滑前行，无论如何总算到达了城里，但那里的医院和乡下的一样落后，没有设备能照料这样一个发出微弱呜咽的小生命。医生说情况紧急，必须尽快送他去奥格登的麦凯迪医院。因为暴风雪的缘故，不能乘坐直升机，所以医生派了一辆救护车。事实上，他们派出了两辆救护车，第二辆为了防止第一辆在暴风雪中出事。">查看中文翻译</div>
