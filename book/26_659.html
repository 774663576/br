<div class="line_en">Was there a "secret" at Bly -- a mystery of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement? I can't say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill.</div>

<div class="line_en">This picture comes back to me in the general train -- the impression, as I received it on my return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些画面一个一个地又依次出现在我眼前：宽敞雪白的隔板间、明亮的灯光，还有壁画，红色的地毯，以及我的朋友露出的相当吃惊的表情，我立刻看出了她很挂念我。一看到她因我的出现而平和放松的心情，我就知道，她对我刚才发生的事一无所知，而我本来已准备告诉她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for a reason that I couldn't then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution -- offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在舒适的大厅里，她一直看着我，我当时也说不清为什么，决定找个含糊的理由来解释晚归，说美丽夜色惹人喜爱，露水太大，打湿了鞋子，便匆匆忙忙回自己房间了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这并不是因为我过于紧张而无法承受，或者极度担心自己变得如此，而是因为我始终翻来覆去地思考真相，显而易见，我无法找到答案，我对那个神秘访客一无所知，而他似乎对我是如此熟悉和了解。没过多少时间我就意识到，我可以不动声色地打探家里的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day -- or at least there were moments, snatched even from clear duties -- when I had to shut myself up to think.</div>

<div class="line_en">My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令我着迷的工作就是与迈尔斯和弗洛拉这两个孩子一起生活，只有当我感觉我能用于面对困难时，我才知道没有什么比这更让我觉得我喜欢这样的生活。两个孩子不断地带给我快乐，使我重新反思最初恐慌的无谓，还有我对于工作可能会枯燥而产生的反感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't mean by this, of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to them -- and it's a marvel for a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!-- I made constant fresh discovoeries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，这并不是指我们只学小说和诗歌，我想说的是，除此之外，我没法对于他俩被激发出的兴趣作出回应。我该怎么说呢，我不想慢慢变得习惯，而想实话实说——这对于一个女家庭教师来讲真是一个奇迹，我有姐妹关系作证——我不断地发现着新的事物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="肯定地说，所有新发现在一个方面停止不前：迈尔斯在学校的表现这个方面，仍然让我迷惑不解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My conclusion bloomed there with the real rose flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid, unclean school world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always, on the part of the majority -- which could include even stupid, sordid headmasters -- turn infallibly to the vindictive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的结论随着他的纯真无邪的自然流露而开花结果：他只是太单纯、太善良了，不适合那个恐怖污浊的校园，他也为此付出了代价。我敏锐地体会到，如此与众不同、品格优秀的人总是会引起多数人，甚至包括愚蠢、阴险的校长怀恨在心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had been promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a pang. Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that -- without a word -- he himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很快注意到，这个秘密突然就平静地呈现在我的面前。可能这样说更接近于事实——他什么也没说就已经解释清了这件事。他的表现让整个指责显得荒谬可笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="毫无疑问，他们就像传说中的小天使一般，在道德上，无可指摘。记得我那时感觉迈尔斯尤其特别，宛如他没有过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never made Miles a muff) that kept them -- how shall I express it? Almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable.</div>

<div class="line_en">We expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew each day. He had never for a second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a Sunday -- to get on -- when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence of which, as the day declined, I had arranged with Mrs. Grose that, should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which, through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of twenty minutes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，有一个星期天，下着倾盆大雨，而且下了很长时间，我们没有办法去教堂。后来在天色渐晚的时候，我和格罗斯太太商量，如果晚上天气能好转的话，我们就一起去做晚礼拜。终于盼到雨停了，我为我们的外出做着准备，这段路程，穿过公园和一条平坦的大路，再到村子，大概有二十分钟的路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them -- with a publicity perhaps not edifying -- while I sat with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the "grown-up" dining room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我正要下楼去大厅和格罗斯太太碰面，忽然想起了那双需要缝三针的手套，好像是周末在非正式宗教宣讲时弄破的，当时我和孩子们坐在一间清冷、干净的、由红木和黄铜装饰的礼拜堂喝茶，那是大人们用餐的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. The person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won't say greater distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met him, catch my breath and turn cold. He was the same -- he was the same, and seen, this time, as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the window, though the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace on which he stood. His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds -- long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been looking at him for years and had known him always.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色非常昏暗，但下午的余光仍能使我一跨进门槛就看到我要找的手套，它就在当时关着的大窗户旁边的椅子上，但我同时觉察到了在窗户的另一边，有人正直直地朝里望着。刚一踏进房间，我的视线瞬间就看到，我一眼看到，它就在那里。那人直直地朝房间里张望着的，正是以前我见过的那个人。他再次出现，不敢说他这次的形象更为清晰，因为那是不可能的，但这次距离如此地近，为我们的邂逅更进一步，遇见他让我感到窒息、身上发冷。一模一样，他这次和上次看上去一模一样，通过窗户露出上半身，尽管餐厅在一楼，但他并没有从他所站的露台上下来。他的脸贴近玻璃，这么清晰的效果，诡异得让我只会想起之前的感觉多么紧张。他只停了一小会儿——但足以让我相信他也看到并认出了我，就好像我曾看着他好几年，非常了解他一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. On the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come for someone else.</div>
