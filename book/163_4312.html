<div class="line_en">The ETO was called an organization of spiritual nobles. Most members came from the highly educated classes, and many were elites of the political and financial spheres. The ETO had once tried to develop membership among the common people, but these efforts all failed. The ETO concluded that the common people did not seem to have the comprehensive and deep understanding of the highly educated about the dark side of humanity. More importantly, because their thoughts were not as deeply influenced by modern science and philosophy, they still felt an overwhelming, instinctual identification with their own species. To betray the human race as a whole was unimaginable for them. But intellectual elites were different: Most of them had already begun to consider issues from a perspective outside the human race. Human civilization had finally given birth to a strong force of alienation.</div>

<div class="line_en">In order to grow fast, the organization operated semi-openly, but the governments of the world never paid much attention to the ETO. The ETO knew that they would be protected by the governments' conservatism and lack of imagination. In those organs wielding the powers of the state, no one took the ETO's proclamations seriously, thinking that they were like other extremists who spewed nonsense. And because of its members' social status, governments always treated it carefully. By the time it was recognized as a threat, the rebels were already everywhere. It was only when the ETO began to develop an armed force that some national security organs began to notice it and realized how unusual it was. Consequently, it was only within the last two years that they had begun to attack the ETO effectively.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Adventist group was the purest, most fundamentalist strand of the ETO, comprised mainly of believers in Evans's Pan-Species Communism. They had completely given up hope in human nature. This despair began with the mass extinctions of the Earth's species caused by modern civilization. Later, other Adventists based their hatred of the human race on other foundations, not limited to issues such as the environment or warfare. Some raised their hatred to very abstract, philosophical levels. Unlike how they would be imagined later, most of them were realists, and did not place too much hope in the alien civilization they served either. Their betrayal was based only on their despair and hatred of the human race. Mike Evans gave the Adventists their motto: We don't know what extraterrestrial civilization is like, but we know humanity.</div>

<div class="line_en">A civilization outside the human race would doubtlessly greatly attract the highly educated classes, and it was easy for them to develop many beautiful fantasies about such a civilization. The human race was a naïve species, and the attraction posed by a more advanced alien civilization was almost irresistible. To make an imperfect analogy: Human civilization was like a young, unworldly person walking alone across the desert of the universe, who has found out about the existence of a potential lover. Though the person could not see the potential lover's face or figure, the knowledge that the other person existed somewhere in the distance created lovely fantasies about the potential lover that spread like wildfire. Gradually, as fantasies about that distant civilization grew more and more elaborate, the Redemptionists developed spiritual feelings toward Trisolaran civilization. Alpha Centauri became Mount Olympus in space, the dwelling place of the gods; and so the Trisolaran religion -- which really had nothing to do with religion on Trisolaris -- was born. Unlike other human religions, they worshipped something that truly existed. Also unlike other human religions, it was the Lord who was in crisis, and the duty of salvation fell on the shoulders of the believer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人类之外的另一个文明，对于高级知识阶层无疑具有巨大的吸引力，并使他们极易对其产生种种美好的幻想。对于人类这样一个幼稚的文明，更高等的异种文明产生的吸引力几乎是不可抗拒的。有一个不太恰当的比喻：人类文明一直是一个孤独行走于宇宙荒漠中的不谙世事的少年，现在她（他）知道了另一个异性的存在，虽然看不到他（她）的面容和身影，但知道他（她）就在远方，对他（她）的美好想象便如同野火般蔓延。渐渐地，随着对那个遥远文明的想象越来越丰富，拯救派在精神上对三体文明产生了宗教感情，人马座三星成了太空中的奥林匹斯山，那是神的住所，三体教由此诞生。与人类的其他宗教不同，三体教崇拜着一个真实存在的对象；与其他宗教相反，处于危难中的是主，而负有拯救责任的是信徒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The main path of spreading Trisolaran culture to society was the Three Body game. The ETO invested enormous effort to develop this massive piece of software. The initial goals were twofold: one, to proselytize the Trisolaran religion; and two, to allow the tentacles of the ETO to spread from the highly educated intelligentsia to the lower social strata, and recruit younger ETO members from the middle and lower classes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Using a shell that drew elements from human society and history, the game explained the culture and history of Trisolaris, thus avoiding alienating beginners. Once a player had advanced to a certain level and had begun to appreciate Trisolaran civilization, the ETO would establish contact, examine the player's sympathies, and finally recruit those who passed the tests to be members of the ETO. But Three Body didn't attract much notice, because the game required too much background knowledge and in-depth thinking, and most young players didn't have the patience or skill to discover the shocking truth beneath its apparently common surface. Those who were attracted by it were still mostly intellectuals.</div>

<div class="line_en">While the Redemptionists developed religious feelings toward Trisolaran civilization, they were also not as extreme as the Adventists in their attitude toward human civilization. Their ultimate ideal was to save the Lord. In order to allow the Lord to continue to exist, they were willing to sacrifice the human world to some degree. But most of them believed that the ideal solution would be to find a way to allow the Lord to continue to live in the Trisolaris stellar system and avoid the invasion of the Earth. Naïvely, they believed that solving the three-body problem would achieve this goal, saving both Trisolaris and the Earth. Admittedly, perhaps this thought wasn't all that naïve. Trisolaran civilization itself had thought so through many eons. The effort to solve the three-body problem was a thread that ran through several hundreds of cycles of Trisolaran civilization. Most Redemptionists with some in-depth math and physics knowledge had attempted the three-body problem, and even after knowing that the problem was mathematically unsolvable as posed, the effort did not cease, because solving the three-body problem had become a religious ritual of their faith. Even though the Redemptionists had many first-class physicists and mathematicians, research in this area never yielded any important results. It took someone like Wei Cheng, a prodigy who had no connection to the ETO or the Trisolaran faith, to accidentally come up with a breakthrough in which the Redemptionists placed much hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拯救派在对三体文明抱有宗教感情的同时，对于人类文明的态度远没有降临派那样极端，他们的最终理想就是拯救主。为了使主生存下去，可以在一定程度上牺牲人类世界。但他们中的大多数人认为，能够使主在三个太阳的半人马座星系生存下去，避免其对太阳系的人侵，是两全其美的理想结局。他们天真地以为，解决物理上的三体问题就能达到这一目标，同时拯救三体和地球两个世界。其实这一想法也未必天真，三体文明本身在相当漫长的时间里也抱有这个想法，解决三体问题的努力贯穿于三体文明的几百次轮回之中。拯救派中有较深物理学和数学背景的人，都有过解决三体问题的尝试，即使在得知三体问题从数学本质上不可解后，仍然没有停止努力，解决三体问题的努力已成为三体教的一种宗教仪式。虽然拯救派中不乏一流的物理学家和数学家，但这种研究一直没有重大成果，倒是像魏成这样与三体叛军和三体教无关的天才，无意中取得了令他们产生很大希望的突破。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the ETO movement continued to develop, a third faction appeared: the Survivors. After confirming the existence of the alien invasion fleet, surviving that war became a most natural human desire. Of course, that war wouldn't occur for another 450 years, and had nothing to do with those living today, but many people hoped that if humans did lose, at least their descendants who were alive in four and a half centuries could live on. Serving the Trisolaran invaders would clearly help with this goal. Compared to the other two factions, the Survivors tended to come from the lower social classes, and most were from the East, and especially from China. Their numbers were still small, but they were growing rapidly. As Trisolaran culture continued to spread, they would become a force that could not be ignored in the future.</div>
