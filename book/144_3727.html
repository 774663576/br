<div class="line_en">At the end of the day, Steve Stallings retired to his hotel suite in the small town. He had his cocaine and his booze and two female companions for the night, and he was going to kick everybody's ass, he was pissed off. For one thing, his part in the picture had been cut to a character part, not a star. He realized he was shifting into a secondary career, an inevitable fate for aging stars. Another thing, Athena had been distant from him all during the shoot, he had hoped for more. Also -- and this was, he himself felt, a little childish -- at the wrap party and showing of the rough cut, he was not getting star treatment; he had not been given one of the Xanadu Hotel's famous Villas.</div>

A desert town had been erected fifty miles from Vegas to denote the base of the Persian army that was to be destroyed by the Emperor Claudius (Steve Stallings) accompanied by his wife, Messalina (Athena).</div>

<div class="line_en">But once the picture started shooting, it was the director who was the boss. Providing he was an A director or the even more powerful Bankable Director (that is, one who would assure an audience in the film's opening weeks and attract Bankable Stars to appear in the movie).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但一旦电影开拍，就是导演做主了。假如他还是一位专拍主流大制作的导演，或更厉害的明星导演（有票房号召力、吸引卖座明星出演的导演），那就更不言自明了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After his long years in the movie business, Steve Stallings knew how the power structure worked. When he was a Bankable Star, he could override everyone. Theoretically, the studio chief was boss, he gave the green light for a picture. A powerful producer who brought a "property" to the studio was also the boss, he got the elements together -- i. e., stars, director, screenplay -- supervised the development of the script, and raised independent money from people who were given a credit as associate producers but had no power. For that period he was the boss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在电影行业浸淫那么多年，斯蒂夫·施塔林斯知道权力结构是如何运作的。当他还是个卖座明星时，他可以谁的面子都不卖。理论上说，电影公司的头是最大的老板，有权审批电影。有能耐的制片人，可以给电影公司捞来能下金蛋的原著小说，也算得上老板，他可以把所有元素都整合到一块儿——比如明星、导演、电影剧本——管理剧情发展，还能从“联合制片人”身上筹集资金，这些联合制片人虽然有个头衔，但是没有任何权力。那段时间里制片人可是说一不二。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The director had complete charge over the picture. Everything had to go through him. The costumes, music, sets, how the actors played their parts. Also, the Directors Guild was the most powerful union in the movie business. No name director would accept the job of replacing another director.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="导演对影片全权负责。每件事都要经过他。服装、音乐、布景，演员怎么演。导演工会也是电影业里实力最强大的团体。没有哪个有名有姓的导演会接受顶替另一个导演。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day's shoot had been physically taxing and Steve Stallings needed relaxation. He showered, ate a big steak, and when the two girls came up, local talent and not bad looking at all, he fed them cocaine and champagne. For once he relaxed his prudence, after all his career was entering its twilight years, and he didn't really have to be careful anymore. He went heavy on the coke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白天的拍摄工作让人身体疲劳，斯蒂夫·施塔林斯需要休息。他洗了个澡，吃了一大块牛排。这时候两位姑娘来了，都是当地的小演员，长得都不错。他让她们吸食可卡因、喝香槟。这一次他敞开了玩，毕竟自己的事业也到了暮年，而且他真的用不着再小心翼翼了。于是他干脆饱吸了一顿可卡因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But all these people, powerful as they were, had to bow to the Bankable Star. A director who had two Bankable Stars in the same movie was like a man riding two wild horses. His balls could be scattered to the four winds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是所有这些人，虽然权势彪炳，照样得向那些最炙手可热的大明星折腰。要是导演在他的电影里同时碰上两个大明星演员，那就好比一个人骑着两匹烈马，卵蛋都要碎成四瓣儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two girls were wearing T-shirts emblazoned with STEVE STALLINGS ASS KISSERS, in tribute to his buttocks, admired by fans all over the world, male and female. They were properly awe-stricken, and it was only after the cocaine that they peeled off their T-shirts and bundled in with him. This cheered him up somewhat. He took another snort of cocaine. The girls were caressing him, stripping off his shorts and shirt. Stallings daydreamed as they fiddled, their fiddling putting him at ease.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tomorrow at the wrap party, he would see all his conquests. He had screwed Athena Aquitane, he had screwed Claudia who had written the movie, he had even screwed Dita Tommey long ago, when she wasn't yet fully convinced of her true sexual orientation. He had screwed Bobby Bantz's wife and, though she no longer counted because she was dead, Skippy Deere's wife. It always gave him a feeling of virtuous fulfillment when at a dinner party he looked around and tallied up all the women who were now sitting so placidly with their husbands and lovers. He was an intimate of them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明天的庆功宴上，他会见到所有曾经得手的情人。他搞过安提娜·阿奎坦内，干过写剧本的克劳迪娅，很久以前甚至还和迪塔·汤美有过一腿——当时她还不知道自己的性取向呢。他上过鲍比·邦茨的妻子，也泡过斯基比·迪尔的老婆，但她已经死了，所以不算数。在晚宴上环顾四周，算一算那些如今安静坐在丈夫或恋人身边的女人，总是给他一种功德圆满的感觉。他和她们都有过私情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, he was aware of a great fatigue: his legs sagged, the glass fell from his hand. He was bewildered. Very far away he heard one of the girls scream and he was furious with her for screaming, and then the very last thing he felt was a lightning bolt exploding in his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然他感觉到极度的疲倦，双腿撑不住身子似的，杯子从手里滑落。脑子迷迷糊糊的。女孩儿们的尖叫好似从极远处传来，这声音让他愤懑不已，他人生的最后一个感觉，仿佛有个闪电球在脑袋里炸开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a distraction. One of the girls was sticking a finger up his ass and that always annoyed him. He had hemorrhoids. He rose from the bed to snort some more cocaine and take a full swig of champagne, but the wine upset his stomach. He felt nauseous and then disoriented. He didn't quite know where he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然他的思绪被拉了回来，一个姑娘为了让他更来劲儿，用手指戳进了他的屁眼里，但是他一向最反感的就是这个。他有痔疮。他从床上坐起身，又吸了几口可卡因，灌下一大口香槟，但酒精让胃很难受。他先是觉得恶心，然后头脑发晕，浑然不知自己身在何处了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first there were just reverent touches for the man who had made women all over the world fall in love with him. Then some women kissed him, other women touched his testicles, his penis, one women took out a pair of scissors from her purse and cut off a great thatch of glossy black hair to expose the underlying fuzz of gray on his skull.</div>

<div class="line_en">What happened next could only have happened with a combination of stupidity and malice. One girl had screamed because Steve Stallings had toppled over her onto the bed and had lain there, mouth open and eyes staring, so obviously dead that both girls panicked and just kept screaming. The screaming attracted the hotel personnel and a number of people who were gambling in the tiny hotel casino, which held only slots, a dice table, and a large, round poker setup. These people followed the screaming and came upstairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were, outside Stallings's hotel room, with its now-open door, several people staring at his naked body sprawled out on the bed. In what seemed just a few minutes, an additional crowd gathered from the town, hundreds of them. They crowded into the room to touch his body.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first woman who reached him -- Deere saw her clearly -- gently closed his eyes and pushed his mouth shut before she softly kissed him on the forehead. But she was pushed aside by the next wave who were not so restrained. And Deere felt the malice within him, the horns Stallings had given him years ago seemed to tingle, and he let the invasion continue. Stallings often boasted that no women could resist him and he was certainly on the mark. Even dead, women were caressing his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪尔看得清楚，第一个走到他跟前的女人先阖上他的眼帘，掩上他的嘴巴，然后在他的额头上轻吻了一记。但她被第二批不那么拘谨的人推到一边。迪尔对他有怨气，多年前施塔林斯给他戴上的绿帽子如今似乎还隐隐作痛，于是他放任那些女人为所欲为。施塔林斯经常吹嘘，说没有女人可以抵挡他的魅力，而这话的确中肯。就算是死了，女人们还在爱抚他的尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The malice came in because Skippy Deere had been one of the first to arrive and had failed to call the police immediately. He watched the first wave of women approach Steve Stallings's body. He had a clear view. Stallings's mouth was open as if he had been caught in the act of singing and there was a look of astonishment on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之所以会有这种亵渎，是因为斯基比·迪尔第一个抵达现场，却没有立即报警。他坐视第一批女人在斯蒂夫·施塔林斯的尸体上上下其手。他看得清清楚楚，施塔林斯的嘴巴开着，好似正在歌唱，脸上还带着惊异非常的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only when a piece of Stallings's ear vanished and he had been turned sideways to show his famous buttocks, his whole body deathly pale, did Deere finally call the police and take command of the situation and solve all the problems.

He also called Dita Tommey to give her the news and have her tell all the Messalina personnel, above the line and below the line, to be sure to attend the showing in Vegas and the wrap party.
