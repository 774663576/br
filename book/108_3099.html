<div class="line_en">Ove walks behind, dragging his steps. He doesn't care that she thinks "it's easier just to pay up and stop arguing." Because it's actually about the principle. Why is that parking attendant entitled to give Ove a ticket for questioning why one has to pay for hospital parking? Ove is not the sort of man who'll stop himself from roaring: "You're just a fake policeman!" at a parking attendant. That's all there is to say about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维拖着步子跟着她。他才不管她那“吵什么吵，付钱走人不就得了嘛”的想法，这实际上是原则问题。那个停车场管理员凭什么因为欧维问了一声在医院门口停车为什么要付钱就要给他开罚单？欧维可不是那种能管住自己不把“装什么蒜”喊出口的人。事情就是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You go to the hospital to die, Ove knows that. It's enough that the state wants to be paid for everything you do while you're alive. When it also wants to be paid for the parking when you go to die, Ove thinks that's about far enough. He explained this in so many words to the parking attendant. And that's when the parking attendant started waving his book at him. And that's when Parvaneh started raging about how she'd be quite happy to pay up. As if that was the important part of the discussion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去医院就是找死的，欧维知道。其实欧维觉得，活人干个什么国家都要收费这事儿就够受了。如今人就快死了，还得付停车费，欧维觉得这实在太过分了。他就是这么跟停车场管理员解释的。就是这时候，停车场管理员挥舞起了罚单。也就是这个时候，帕尔瓦娜擅自开口说她愿意付钱。就好像这才是这场争论的重点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He hears the seven-year-old complaining in front of him that her clothes are smelling of exhaust. Even though they kept the Saab's windows rolled down all the way, it wasn't possible to get rid of the stench. Their mother had asked Ove what he'd really been doing in the garage, but Ove had just answered with a sound more or less like when you try to move a bathtub by dragging it across some tiles. Of course, for the three-year-old it was the greatest adventure of her life to be able to drive along in a car with all its windows down although it was below freezing outside. The seven-year-old, on the other hand, had burrowed her face into her scarf and vented a good deal more skepticism. She'd been irritated about slipping around with her bottom on the sheets of newspaper Ove had spread across the seat to stop them "filthifying things." Ove had also spread newspaper on the front seat, but her mother snatched it away before she sat down. Ove had looked more than advisably displeased about this, but managed not to say anything. Instead he constantly glanced at her stomach all the way to the hospital, as if anxious that she might suddenly start leaking on the upholstery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听见七岁女孩在他面前抱怨衣服上有汽油味。尽管一路上萨博的车窗都是开着的，但那股恶臭还是挥之不去。她们的妈妈问过欧维他究竟在车库里搞什么名堂，但欧维只是发出一种大约接近于在瓷砖上拖浴缸发出的声音作为回答。三岁女孩认为，在室外温零下时大开车窗简直就是个美妙的童话，七岁女孩却恰恰相反，她把脸深深地埋在围巾里，满腹狐疑。并且，她也很讨厌把屁股蹭在欧维为了防止她和妹妹“拉裤子”而在车座上铺满的报纸上。欧维也在前座铺了报纸，但她们的妈妈坐下前就把报纸给撕了。欧维看上去不怎么乐意，但什么都没说。他只是坐在一旁，不停地扫去不安的眼神，就好像担心羊水会漏到坐垫上一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
