<div class="line_en">"Good morning. I am Detective Inspector Walsh and this is Sergeant Foster." The Inspector did not smile. He was a big man in an old black suit and a black hat and coat. He wore a coat because he always felt cold. "Last night someone put sleeping tablets in Mrs Clarkson's hot milk. We are going to question everybody, and we need a room, please."</div>

Suddenly the door opened and the two detectives came in.</div>
