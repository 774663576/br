<div class="line_en">Human sacrifice and witch-burnings are just two examples of the harm that can result from people pursuing ends that involve figments of their imagination. Another may be seen in psychotics who kill in pursuit of a delusion, such as Charles Manson's plan to hasten an apocalyptic race war, and John Hinckley's scheme to impress Jodie Foster. But the greatest damage comes from religious beliefs that downgrade the lives of flesh-and-blood people, such as the faith that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next, or that flying a plane into a skyscraper will earn the pilot seventy-two virgins in heaven. As we saw in chapter 1, the belief that one may escape from an eternity in hell only by accepting Jesus as a savior makes it a moral imperative to coerce people into accepting that belief and to silence anyone who might sow doubt about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">A broader danger of unverifiable beliefs is the temptation to defend them by violent means. People become wedded to their beliefs, because the validity of those beliefs reflects on their competence, commends them as authorities, and rationalizes their mandate to lead. Challenge a person's beliefs, and you challenge his dignity, standing, and power. And when those beliefs are based on nothing but faith, they are chronically fragile. No one gets upset about the belief that rocks fall down as opposed to up, because all sane people can see it with their own eyes. Not so for the belief that babies are born with original sin or that God exists in three persons or that Ali was the second-most divinely inspired man after Muhammad. When people organize their lives around these beliefs, and then learn of other people who seem to be doing just fine without them -- or worse, who credibly rebut them -- they are in danger of looking like fools. Since one cannot defend a belief based on faith by persuading skeptics it is true, the faithful are apt to react to unbelief with rage, and may try to eliminate that affront to everything that makes their lives meaningful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无凭无据的信仰所带来的最大危险是，这些信仰要靠暴力手段来维护。确立信仰本身反映出人们自己的能力，它给予的赞赏具有权威性，还可以让统治者的地位具有合法性。为此，人们对自己的信仰越来越执着。挑战一个人的信仰，就是挑战他的尊严、他的立场和他的权力。当这些信仰的依据仅仅是信念而没有其他支持的时候，不断地被人挑战，成了信仰根深蒂固的弱点。相信石头向下坠落而不是飞上天，没有人会对此感到难以接受，因为所有清醒的人都能看见这个事实。但是要说婴儿生来带有原罪，或者上帝是三位一体，或者阿里是排在穆罕默德之后第二位最有神性的人，就不是所有人都愿意接受了。每当人们以信仰为中心组织自己的生活时，他们会发现其他人没有这些信仰也活得挺好——或者更糟糕的是，这些人还对他们的信仰提出了确凿的反证，他们反而成为众人眼中的傻瓜。信徒们无法用说服怀疑派来维护自己基于信心的信仰，那就只有采取激愤的手段对付他们了。信仰是信徒生活的全部意义所在，侮辱这一信仰的人，必彻底消灭之。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The human toll of the persecution of heretics and nonbelievers in medieval and early modern Christendom beggars the imagination and belies the conventional wisdom that the 20th century was an unusually violent era. Though no one knows exactly how many people were killed in these holy slaughters, we can get a sense from numerical estimates by atrocitologists such as the political scientist R. J. Rummel in his books Death by Government and Statistics of Democide and the historian Matthew White in his Great Big Book of Horrible Things and his "Deaths by Mass Unpleasantness" Web site. They have tried to put numbers on the death tolls of wars and massacres, including those for which conventional statistics are unavailable, by combing the available sources, assessing their credibility with sanity checks and allowances for bias, and selecting a middle value, often the geometric mean of the lowest and the highest credible figures. I'll present Rummel's estimates for this era, which are generally lower than White's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中世纪和近代基督教世界对异教徒和无信仰者的迫害极其残忍，杀戮的人数之众，超出人们的想象。相比之下，那些认为20世纪是暴力巅峰的传统观念，实在是大错特错了。没有人知道到底有多少人死于这些神圣屠杀，我们只能从考古学家的估计中看到一个大概。比如，政治学家鲁道夫·J·鲁梅尔在他的《因政府而死》（Death by Government）和《政府杀戮的统计》（Statistics of Democide）中，历史学家马修·怀特在他的《恐怖事件大全》（The Great Big Book of Horrible Things）和网站“大规模争执造成的死亡”中，分别给出了他们的估算。他们力图推算出战争大屠杀的受害者人数，包括没有常规统计资料的事件。他们梳理能够找到的资料，使用健全性测试手段评估数据的可信程度以及允许的误差，通常他们取可靠数据的最高值和最低值之间的几何平均数，即中间值。我在本书中出示的是鲁梅尔对该时期的估算，他的数字一般低于怀特的估算。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the 13th century the Cathars of southern France embraced the Albigensian heresy, according to which there are two gods, one of good and one of evil. An infuriated papacy, in collusion with the king of France, sent waves of armies to the region, which killed around 200,000 of them. To give you a sense of the armies' tactics, after capturing the city of Bram in 1210 they took a hundred of the defeated soldiers, cut off their noses and upper lips, gouged out the eyes of all but one, and had him lead the others to the city of Cabaret to terrorize its citizens into surrendering. The reason you have never met a Cathar is that the Albigensian Crusade exterminated them. Historians classify this episode as a clear instance of genocide.</div>

<div class="line_en">Between 1095 and 1208 Crusader armies were mobilized to fight a "just war" to retake Jerusalem from Muslim Turks, earning them remission from their sins and a ticket to heaven. They massacred Jewish communities on the way, and after besieging and sacking Nicea, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, they slaughtered their Muslim and Jewish populations. Rummel estimates the death toll at 1 million. The world had around 400 million people at the time, about a sixth of the number in the mid-20th century, so the death toll of the Crusader massacres as a proportion of the world population would today come out at around 6 million, equivalent to the Nazis' genocide of the Jews.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shortly after the suppression of the Albigensian heresy, the Inquisition was set up to root out other heresies in Europe. Between the late 15th and early 18th centuries, the Spanish branch took aim at converts from Judaism and Islam who were suspected of backsliding into their old practices. One transcript from 16th-century Toledo describes the inquisition of a woman who was accused of wearing clean underwear on Saturday, a sign that she was a secret Jew. She was subjected to the rack and the water torture (I'll spare you the details -- it was worse than waterboarding), given several days to recover, and tortured again while she desperately tried to figure out what she should confess to. The Vatican today claims that the Inquisition killed only a few thousand people, but it leaves off the books the larger number of victims who were remanded to secular authorities for execution or imprisonment (often a slow death sentence), together with the victims of branch offices in the New World. Rummel estimates the death toll from the Spanish Inquisition at 350,000.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔比异端镇压过去不久，宗教裁判所又登上历史舞台，开始清除欧洲的其他异端。从15世纪末到18世纪初，西班牙的宗教裁判以皈依的犹太人和穆斯林为目标，指责他们恢复旧习。16世纪托莱多的一份手稿描述了宗教裁判所审讯一位妇女的情景。这位妇女被指控在星期六穿着干净的内衣，说明她是一个秘密的犹太教徒。她受到绞床和水刑的折磨（我就不向各位叙述细节了——这个肯定比美国反恐的水刑更糟糕）。每次酷刑后停止几天，让她恢复体力，然后再次开始施刑。而她，一直在努力揣摩到底应该忏悔些什么。梵蒂冈教廷今天说宗教裁判所只杀害了几百人，它忽略了一个事实，即绝大部分受害者是送交世俗的行政当局处决和监禁的，那些监禁通常只是拖长的死刑而已。此外，还有新大陆宗教裁判所分部的受害者。鲁梅尔估计，仅西班牙宗教裁判就杀害了35万人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the Reformation, the Catholic Church had to deal with the vast number of people in northern Europe who became Protestants, often involuntarily after their local prince or king had converted. The Protestants, for their part, had to deal with the breakaway sects that wanted nothing to do with either branch of Christianity, and of course with the Jews. One might think that Protestants, who had been persecuted so viciously for their heresies against Catholic doctrines, would take a dim view of the idea of persecuting heretics, but no.

<div class="line_en">With the people who brought us the Crusades and Inquisition on one side, and the people who wanted to kill rabbis, Anabaptists, and Unitarians on the other, it's not surprising that the European Wars of Religion between 1520 and 1648 were nasty, brutish, and long. The wars were fought, to be sure, not just over religion but also over territorial and dynastic power, but the religious differences kept tempers at a fever pitch. According to the classification of the military historian Quincy Wright, the Wars of Religion embrace the French Huguenot Wars (1562-94), the Dutch Wars of Independence, also known as the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648), the Thirty Years' War (1618-48), the English Civil War (1642-48), the wars of Elizabeth I in Ireland, Scotland, and Spain (1586-1603), the War of the Holy League (1508-16), and Charles V's wars in Mexico, Peru, France, and the Ottoman Empire (1521-52). The rates of death in these wars were staggering. During the Thirty Years' War soldiers laid waste to much of present-day Germany, reducing its population by around a third. Rummel puts the death toll at 5.75 million, which as a proportion of the world's population at the time was more than double the death rate of World War I and was in the range of World War II in Europe. The historian Simon Schama estimates that the English Civil War killed almost half a million people, a loss that is proportionally greater than that in World War I.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一边是十字军和宗教裁判所，另一边是要杀死拉比、再洗礼派教徒和神体一位派，所以，1520年至1648年间，欧洲宗教战争是混乱、残忍和漫长的。这些混战肯定不仅是为了宗教，也是为了疆土和王朝的权力，但宗教之争让人们的情绪白热化了。根据军事史学家昆西·赖特的分类，宗教战争包括法国胡格诺战争（1562—1594）；荷兰独立战争，也称“八十年战争”（1568—1648）；“三十年战争”（1618—1648）；“英国内战”（1642—1648）；伊丽莎白一世对爱尔兰、苏格兰和西班牙的历次战争（1586—1603）；“神圣同盟战争”（1508—1516）；查理五世对墨西哥、秘鲁、法国和奥斯曼的历次战争（1521—1552）。这些战争伤亡率极为惨重。在“三十年战争”中，士兵战死的数量和“二战”中的德国相比，人口为此下降1/3。鲁梅尔估计死亡总人数是575万，按照当时的世界人口，这个死亡率是欧洲第一次世界大战死亡率的两倍，与第二次世界大战死亡率相当。历史学家西蒙·沙玛（Simon Schama）估计，英国内战中有50万人丧生。按比例计算，死亡率超过第一次世界大战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't until the second half of the 17th century that Europeans finally began to lose their zeal for killing people with the wrong supernatural beliefs. The Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648, confirmed the principle that each local prince could decide whether his state would be Protestant or Catholic and that the minority denomination in each one could more or less live in peace. (Pope Innocent X was not a good sport about this: he declared the Peace "null, void, invalid, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all time.") The Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions began to run out of steam in the 17th century, declined further in the 18th, and were shut down in 1834 and 1821, respectively. England put religious killing behind it after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Though the divisions of Christianity have sporadically continued to skirmish right up to the present (Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, and Catholics and Orthodox Christians in the Balkans), today the disputes are more ethnic and political than theological. Beginning in the 1790s, Jews were granted legal equality in the West, first in the United States, France, and the Netherlands, and then, over the following century, in most of the rest of Europe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一直到17世纪下半叶，欧洲人终于开始厌倦杀戮，不再因为别人的信仰错误而大开杀戒了。1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》标志着“三十年战争”的结束，确立了各王公决定本国宗教信仰（新教或者天主教）的原则，让少数派也能在和平中生活。（教皇英诺森十世对和平很不适应，他“永久地”宣布和平条约“废止、无效、失效、不公、被诅咒、堕落、愚蠢、毫无意义和影响”。）西班牙和葡萄牙的宗教裁判所在17世纪失去势头，在18世纪进一步减弱，最终分别在1834年和1821年彻底关门。英国在1688年光荣革命之后就不再有宗教杀戮。虽然一直到现在，基督教的各个宗派之间还是时有冲突（比如北爱尔兰的新教和天主教，巴尔干国家的天主教和东正教），但今天的矛盾更多是种族性和政治性的，而不是宗教性的。从18世纪90年代开始，西方给予犹太人平等的合法地位，首先是美国、法国和荷兰，接着在19世纪扩展至欧洲的大部分国家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What made Europeans finally decide that it was all right to let their dissenting compatriots risk eternal damnation and, by their bad example, lure others to that fate? Perhaps they were exhausted by the Wars of Religion, but it's not clear why it took thirty years to exhaust them rather than ten or twenty. One gets a sense that people started to place a higher value on human life. Part of this newfound appreciation was an emotional change: a habit of identifying with the pains and pleasures of others. And another part was an intellectual and moral change: a shift from valuing souls to valuing lives. The doctrine of the sacredness of the soul sounds vaguely uplifting, but in fact is highly malignant. It discounts life on earth as just a temporary phase that people pass through, indeed, an infinitesimal fraction of their existence. Death becomes a mere rite of passage, like puberty or a midlife crisis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到底是什么原因使欧洲人终于决定，即使让他们的异见同胞承担永堕炼狱的风险，并且以身试法诱惑他人一同沉沦，也没有什么了不起的？也许，“宗教战争”实在让他们精疲力竭了。但是为什么要花30年才能把他们的能量消耗殆尽，为什么不是10年或20年？有人觉得，人们从那时开始给予生命更高的价值。这种新开发的鉴赏力，部分源于情感的变化，即开始习惯认同他人的痛苦和快乐；另一部分源于认知和道德的变化，即从珍视灵魂变为珍视生命。灵魂神圣的说教听起来令人眩晕振奋，但事实上极其有害。它将现世的生命贬低为一个转瞬即逝的过渡状态，仅仅是生命存在的一个微不足道的小片段。死亡，好比青春发育期和中年危机，无非是生命的一个必经阶段而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gradual replacement of lives for souls as the locus of moral value was helped along by the ascendancy of skepticism and reason. No one can deny the difference between life and death or the existence of suffering, but it takes indoctrination to hold beliefs about what becomes of an immortal soul after it has parted company from the body. The 17th century is called the Age of Reason, an age when writers began to insist that beliefs be justified by experience and logic. That undermines dogmas about souls and salvation, and it undermines the policy of forcing people to believe unbelievable things at the point of a sword (or a Judas's Cradle).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧洲怀疑论和理性主义日渐兴起，推动了以生命而不再是灵魂，作为道德和价值轴心的转换。没有人能够否认生命和死亡之间的差别以及苦难的存在，但是对不灭的灵魂离开躯体之后的事情，却是需要灌输来培养的信念。17世纪被称为“理性年代”，因为学者们开始坚持认为信仰应该接受经验和逻辑的证明。这一立场打破了有关灵魂和救赎的教条，也打破了当权者的暴力政策，即用暴力（比如“犹大的摇篮”）胁迫人们相信无法相信的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Calvin says that he is certain, and [other sects] say that they are; Calvin says that they are wrong and wishes to judge them, and so do they. Who shall be judge? Who made Calvin the arbiter of all the sects, that he alone should kill? He has the Word of God and so have they. If the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin? But then why does he write so many books about manifest truth?… In view of the uncertainty we must define the heretic simply as one with whom we disagree. And if then we are going to kill heretics, the logical outcome will be a war of extermination, since each is sure of himself. Calvin would have to invade France and all other nations, wipe out cities, put all the inhabitants to the sword, sparing neither sex nor age, not even babies and the beasts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Erasmus and other skeptical philosophers noted that human knowledge was inherently fragile. If our eyes can be fooled by a visual illusion (such as an oar that appears to be broken at the water's surface, or a cylindrical tower in the distance that appears to be square), why should we trust our beliefs about more vaporous objects? Calvin's burning of Michael Servetus in 1553 prompted a widespread scrutiny of the very idea of religious persecution. The French scholar Sebastian Castellio led the charge by calling attention to the absurdity of different people being unshakably certain of the truth of their mutually incompatible beliefs. He also noted the horrific moral consequences of acting on these beliefs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The arguments were picked up in the 17th century by, among others, Baruch Spinoza, John Milton (who wrote, "Let truth and falsehood grapple… truth is strong"), Isaac Newton, and John Locke. The emergence of modern science proved that deeply held beliefs could be entirely false, and that the world worked by physical laws rather than by divine whims. The Catholic Church did itself no favor by threatening Galileo with torture and committing him to a life sentence of house arrest for espousing what turned out to be correct beliefs about the physical world. And the skeptical mindset, sometimes spiced with humor and common sense, was increasingly allowed to challenge superstition. In Henry IV, Part 1, Glendower boasts, "I can call spirits from the vasty deep." Hotspur replies, "Why, so can I, or so can any man; / But will they come when you do call for them?" Francis Bacon, often credited with the principle that beliefs must be grounded in observation, wrote of a man who was taken to a house of worship and shown a painting of sailors who had escaped shipwreck by paying their holy vows. The man was asked whether this didn't prove the power of the gods. "Aye," he answered, "but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="17世纪的很多学者参加了这场争论，他们有巴鲁克·斯宾诺莎、约翰·弥尔顿（他写道，“让真理和谎言掐架…真理是强大的”）、艾萨克·牛顿和约翰·洛克。刚刚浮现的现代科学证明，人们深信不疑的信仰可能是彻头彻尾的谎言，世界的运作遵循自然法则，而不是神的奇思妙想。天主教教会用酷刑威胁伽利略，并对他施以终身软禁，就因为他相信一个自然界的事实，而他后来被证明是正确的。教会的做法对自己非常不利。人们越来越多地用怀疑论的思维，加上幽默和常识，来挑战迷信。在《亨利四世》第一幕中，格伦道尔吹牛说：“我可以召唤地下的幽魂。”豪斯伯回答说：“啊，这我也会，什么人都会；可是您召唤它们的时候，它们果然会应召而来吗？”弗朗西斯·培根，以提出信念必须以观察为基础的原则著称。他写道，一个男子被带到教堂看画，画上是一群向神明发愿祷告而逃过沉船灾难的水手。这位男子被问道：“这难道不是证明了神明的力量？”他回答说：“是。不过，那些发愿之后被淹死的人呢？他们被画在哪里？”">查看中文翻译</div>
