<div class="line_en">Da Shi, if I had known you were following me, I would have been comforted, Wang thought, switching to Shi Qiang's familiar nickname in his mind, though self-respect made him hold back the words.

<div class="line_en">Wang Miao had no idea how he got back into his car. He tumbled into the backseat and fell into a dreamless slumber. He didn't think that he was asleep for long, but when he opened his eyes, the sun was already near the horizon in the west. He got out of the car. Even though the alcohol that morning had made him weak, he did feel better. He saw that he was at one corner of the Forbidden City. The setting sun shone on the ancient palace and turned into bright gold ripples in the moat. In his eyes, the world became once again classical and stable. Wang sat until it got dark, enjoying the peace that had been missing from his life. The black Volkswagen Santana that he was now so familiar with pulled out of the traffic streaming through the street and braked to a stop right in front of him. Shi Qiang got out of the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汪淼不知道自己是怎么回到自己的车上，躺在后座上陷入了无梦的沉睡，感觉时间并不长，但睁开眼睛后，看到太阳已在城市的西边快要落下去了。他走下车，虽然早上喝的酒让他浑身发软，但感觉好多了。他看到，自己正在紫禁城的一角，夕阳照在古老的皇宫上，在护城河中泛起碎金，在他眼中，世界又恢复了古典和稳定。汪淼就这样享受着久违的宁静，直到天色暗下来，那辆他熟悉的黑色桑塔纳从街道上车流中钻出来，径直开过来刹住，大史走了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

I'll be honest: I know fucking shit. My pay grade is too low, and they tell me nothing. Sometimes I think this is a nightmare."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大史盯着汪淼看了一会儿，然后仰天一笑，”这话我也对常伟思说过几次，咱俩是难兄难弟。实话告诉你，我他妈的什么也不知道，级别低，他们不告诉我，有时真像在做噩梦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In my line of work, it's all about putting together many apparently unconnected things. When you piece them together the right way, you get the truth. For a while now, strange things have been happening. "For example, there's been an unprecedented wave of crimes against academia and science research institutions. Of course you know about the explosion at the Liangxiang accelerator construction site. There was also the murder of that Nobel laureate… the crimes were all unusual: not for money, not for revenge. No political background, just pure destruction. "Other strange things didn't involve crimes. For example, the Frontiers of Science and the suicides of those academics. Environmental activists have also become extra bold: protest mobs at construction sites to stop nuclear power plants and hydroelectric dams, experimental communities 'returning to nature,' and other apparently trivial matters… Do you go to the movies?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Recent big-budget films all have rustic themes. The setting is always green mountains and clear water, with handsome men and pretty women of some indeterminate era living in harmony with nature. To use the words of the directors, they 'represent the beautiful life before science spoiled nature.' Take Peach Blossom Spring: it's clearly the sort of film that no one wants to see. But they spent hundreds of millions to make it. There was also this science fiction contest with a top reward of five million for the person who imagined the most disgusting possible future. They spent another few hundred million to turn the winning stories into movies.

<div class="line_en">"Ah, that's another thing. All the countries are keeping a tight lid on this, and they've been successful so far. I can guarantee you that the enemy is incredibly powerful. Those in charge are terrified! I know General Chang very well. He's the sort who's afraid of nothing, not even the sky falling, but I can tell that he's worried about something much worse right now. They're all scared out of their wits, and they have no confidence that we'll win."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这又是一个了不得的现象：所有国家同时保密，而且做的这么严实。我现在可以肯定一点：敌人是个狠角色，上面害怕了！我太熟悉常伟思了，从他那里就能看出来，他是天塌下来都不怕的人，但现在塌下来的可能不止是天了。他们被吓得够呛，他们根本没有信心战胜那个敌人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Everyone is afraid of something. The enemy must be, too. The more powerful they are, the more they have to lose to their fears."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那它怕什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You! Scientists! The odd thing is that the less practical your research is, the more they're afraid of you -- like abstract theories, the kind of thing Yang Dong worked on. They are more frightened of such work than you are of the universe winking at you. That's why they're so ruthless. If killing you would solve the problem, you'd all be dead by now. But the most effective technique remains disrupting your thoughts. When a scientist dies, another will take his place. But if his thoughts are confused, then science is over."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怕你们，怕科学家。而且奇怪的是，你们研究的东西越是没有实际用处，越是天马行空不着边际，像杨冬那号的，它就越怕，比你怕宇宙眨眼更怕，所以才出手这么狠。要是杀你们有用，它早就把你们杀光了，但最有效的办法还是扰乱你们的思想，人死了还会有别人，但思想乱了，科学就完了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
