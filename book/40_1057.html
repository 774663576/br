<div class="line_en">From that night on, Mariam and Laila did their chores together. They sat in the kitchen and rolled dough, chopped green onions, minced garlic, offered bits of cucumber to Aziza, who banged spoons nearby and played with carrots. In the yard, Aziza lay in a wicker bassinet, dressed in layers of clothing, a winter muffler wrapped snugly around her neck. Mariam and Laila kept a watchful eye on her as they did the wash, Mariam's knuckles bumping Laila's as they scrubbed shirts and trousers and diapers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从那晚之后，玛丽雅姆便和莱拉共同做家务活。在厨房，她们坐下来和面粉，切绿洋葱，剁蒜头，弄几口南瓜喂在旁边敲木勺、玩胡萝卜的阿兹莎。在院子里，阿兹莎躺在一个藤篮里面，穿着一层又一层的衣服，脖子盘着一条温暖而舒适的围巾。玛丽雅姆和莱拉一边洗衣服，一边不时关注地向她望去；她们揉搓着衬衣、裤子和尿布，两人的指节不断相互碰撞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam slowly grew accustomed to this tentative but pleasant companionship. She was eager for the three cups of chai she and Laila would share in the yard, a nightly ritual now. In the mornings, Mariam found herself looking forward to the sound of Laila's cracked slippers slapping the steps as she came down for breakfast and to the tinkle of Aziza's shrill laugh, to the sight of her eight little teeth, the milky scent of her skin. If Laila and Aziza slept in, Mariam became anxious waiting. She washed dishes that didn't need washing. She rearranged cushions in the living room. She dusted clean windowsills. She kept herself occupied until Laila entered the kitchen, Aziza hoisted on her hip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆慢慢适应了这种不无顾忌然而令人愉快的相处。她渴望和莱拉在院子里分享三杯茶，如今这已成了一个晚间仪式。每天早晨，玛丽雅姆总是等待莱拉下楼吃早餐，渴望听到她的拖鞋在楼梯上的啪嗒声，渴望听到阿兹莎欢快的咯咯笑声、见到她那八颗小小的牙齿、嗅到她皮肤上的奶香味。如果莱拉和阿兹莎赖床不起，玛丽雅姆就会坐立不安地等待。她洗刷那些并不需要洗刷的盘碗。她重新摆布客厅的窗帘。她拿掸子清扫一尘不染的阳台。她让自己忙个不停，直到莱拉走进厨房，背上驮着阿兹莎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Aziza first spotted Mariam in the morning, her eyes always sprang open, and she began mewling and squirming in her mother's grip. She thrust her arms toward Mariam, demanding to be held, her tiny hands opening and closing urgently, on her face a look of both adoration and quivering anxiety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天早晨，当阿兹莎第一眼看到玛丽雅姆时，她总是眼睛一亮，开始在她母亲的怀里扭动叫喊。她伸开双臂，要求玛丽雅姆抱她，两只小手焦急地张开合上，脸上流露出爱慕而又紧张得发抖的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">EARLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR, in January 1994, Dostum did switch sides. He joined Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and took up position near Bala Hissar, the old citadel walls that loomed over the city from the Koh-e-Shirdawaza mountains. Together, they fired on Massoud and Rabbani forces at the Ministry of Defense and the Presidential Palace. From either side of the Kabul River, they released rounds of artillery at each other. The streets became littered with bodies, glass, and crumpled chunks of metal. There was looting, murder, and, increasingly, rape, which was used to intimidate civilians and reward militiamen. Mariam heard of women who were killing themselves out of fear of being raped, and of men who, in the name of honor, would kill their wives or daughters if they'd been raped by the militia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二年刚开始的时候，也就是1994年1月，杜斯塔姆果真反水了。他加入了古勒卜丁·希克马蒂亚尔的阵线，在巴拉·希萨堡垒附近安营扎寨。这座古老的城堡就在雪达瓦扎山脉上，俯瞰着下方的城市。他们一起朝驻扎在国防部与总统府的马苏德和拉巴尼的部队开火。隔着喀布尔河，双方发射了一轮又一轮的炮弹。马路上开始散落着尸体、玻璃和变形的大块金属碎片。有人被狙击手射杀，有人被谋杀，越来越多的人被强奸——强奸被用来惩罚市民和奖励士兵。玛丽雅姆听说有些女人因为担心失去贞操而结束了自己的生命，有的男人则因为妻子或者女儿被士兵奸污而打着名誉的幌子将她们杀害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aziza shrieked at the thumping of mortars. To distract her, Mariam arranged grains of rice on the floor, in the shape of a house or a rooster or a star, and let Aziza scatter them. She drew elephants for Aziza the way Jalil had shown her, in one stroke, without ever lifting the tip of the pen.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a week, the fighting forced even Rasheed to stay home. He locked the door to the yard, set booby traps, locked the front door too and barricaded it with the couch. He paced the house, smoking, peering out the window, cleaning his gun, loading and loading it again. Twice, he fired his weapon into the street claiming he'd seen someone trying to climb the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一个星期，战火甚至迫使拉希德也留在家里。他锁上了通往院子的房门，在门后设置了陷阱；他把前门也锁上了，并用沙发把它堵住。他在屋子里走来走去，不停地吸烟，把头探出窗外打探情况，擦拭他的手枪，一次又一次地装上子弹。他有两次朝外面的街道开枪，宣称他看到有人试图爬过围墙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rasheed said civilians were getting killed daily, by the dozens. Hospitals and stores holding medical supplies were getting shelled. Vehicles carrying emergency food supplies were being barred from entering the city, he said, raided, shot at. Mariam wondered if there was fighting like this in Herat too, and, if so, how Mullah Faizullah was coping, if he was still alive, and Bibi jo too, with all her sons, brides, and grandchildren. And, of course, Jalil. Was he hiding out, Mariam wondered, as she was? Or had he taken his wives and children and fled the country? She hoped Jalil was somewhere safe, that he'd managed to get away from all of this killing.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They're forcing young boys to join," he said. "The Mujahideen are. In plain daylight, at gunpoint. They drag boys right off the streets. And when soldiers from a rival militia capture these boys, they torture them. I heard they electrocute them -- it's what I heard -- that they crush their balls with pliers. They make the boys lead them to their homes. Then they break in, kill their fathers, rape their sisters and mothers."</div>

<div class="line_en">He waved his gun over his head. "Let's see them try to break into my house. I'll crush their balls! I'll blow their heads off! Do you know how lucky you two are to have a man who's not afraid of Shaitan himself?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Aziza passed gas in her sleep. Laila began to laugh, and Mariam joined in. They laughed like this, at each other's reflection in the mirror, their eyes tearing, and the moment was so natural, so effortless, that suddenly Mariam started telling her about Jalil, and Nana, and the jinn. Laila stood with her hands idle on Mariam's shoulders, eyes locked on Mariam's face in the mirror. Out the words came, like blood gushing from an artery. Mariam told her about Bibi jo, Mullah Faizullah, the humiliating trek to Jalil's house, Nana's suicide. She told about Jalil's wives, and the hurried nikka with Rasheed, the trip to Kabul, her pregnancies, the endless cycles of hope and disappointment, Rasheed's turning on her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后睡梦中的阿兹莎放了一个屁。先是莱拉忍俊不禁，跟着玛丽雅姆也笑了起来。她们就这样哈哈大笑，镜子中，她们两人笑得眼泪直流；这一刻是多么自然，多么轻松；突然之间，玛丽雅姆开始跟莱拉说起扎里勒、娜娜还有娜娜身上的妖怪。莱拉站着，双手轻轻地放在玛丽雅姆的肩膀上，眼睛盯着镜子中玛丽雅姆的脸庞。那些话倾吐而出，如同鲜血从血管中喷涌出来一样。玛丽雅姆跟她说起亲爱的碧碧、法苏拉赫毛拉、那次去扎里勒家自取其辱的经历、娜娜的自杀。她提到扎里勒的几个妻子、和拉希德匆匆的婚礼、前来喀布尔的路途、她的几次怀孕、那些希望与失望的无尽循环、拉希德对她的虐待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">MARIAM WAS RELIEVED when the fighting subsided again, mostly because they no longer had to be cooped up with Rasheed, with his sour temper infecting the household. And he'd frightened her badly waving that loaded gun near Aziza.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="战火再次平息下去，玛丽雅姆松了一口气，主要是因为她们再也不用和拉希德共困一室了。他的臭脾气影响了整个家庭，再说了，他那把上了子弹的手枪总是在阿兹莎身边摇摇晃晃，这也让玛丽雅姆担心得要死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam sat still and watched Laila's slim fingers in the mirror tighten her plaits, Laila's face scrunched in concentration. Aziza was curled up asleep on the floor.

<div class="line_en">Seasons had come and gone; presidents in Kabul had been inaugurated and murdered; an empire had been defeated; old wars had ended and new ones had broken out. But Mariam had hardly noticed, hardly cared. She had passed these years in a distant corner of her mind. A dry, barren field, out beyond wish and lament, beyond dream and disillusionment. There, the future did not matter. And the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年年秋去冬又来，几个总统在喀布尔上任又被谋杀；一个帝国入侵阿富汗又被打败，旧的战争才结束新的战争又开始。但玛丽雅姆从没留意，从不关心。她躲在自己心灵的一个遥远角落，独自度过了这些岁月。那儿是一片干旱贫瘠的土地，没有希望，也没有哀伤；没有梦想，也没有幻灭。那儿无所谓未来。那儿的过去只留下这个教训：爱是使人遍体鳞伤的错误，而它的帮凶，希望，则是令人悔恨莫及的幻想。无论什么时候，若这一对剧毒的两生花开始在那片干涸的土地上生长出来，玛丽雅姆就会将它们连根拔除。她把它们拔起来，还没拿稳就赶紧将其掩埋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After, Laila sat at the foot of Mariam's chair. Absently, she removed a scrap of lint entangled in Aziza's hair. A silence ensued.</div>

A new life, a life in which she would find the blessings that Nana had said a harami like her would never see. Two new flowers had unexpectedly sprouted in her life, and, as Mariam watched the snow coming down, she pictured Mullah Faizullah twirling his tasbeh beads, leaning in and whispering to her in his soft, tremulous voice, But it is God Who has planted them, Mariam jo.
