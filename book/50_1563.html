He sought warmth and company in the bustling Bartleby mausoleum, but the Bartleby family -- seven generations of them -- had no time for him that night.

<div class="line_en">"Don't you look at me with that face on, young man," she said. "Things blossom in their time. They bud and bloom, blossom and fade. Everything in its time." She huddled deeper into her cloak and bonnet and she said,</div>

<div class="line_en">Bod walked down to the crumbling little church. He slipped between the stones, and into the crypt, where he sat and waited for Silas to return. He was cold, true, but the cold did not bother Bod, not really: the graveyard embraced him, and the dead do not mind the cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bod shivered. He wanted to embrace his guardian, to hold him and tell him that he would never desert him, but the action was unthinkable.

<div class="line_cn" title="伯蒂颤了颤。他想拥抱赛拉斯，紧紧抱住，告诉他自己永远不会弃他而去，可这种行为不可想象。他无法拥抱赛拉斯，就像他无法抓住月光，这并不是因为赛拉斯是虚幻的，而是因为这本身是错的。世上有你可以拥抱的人，其中也包括赛拉斯。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was made of small five-petaled flowers, and he had just put his head in to sniff the perfume when he heard footsteps coming up the path.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这儿香味更浓。有那么一瞬，伯蒂以为不久前刚下过雪，因为常春藤上有星星点点的白色。他凑近一丛常春藤，细细观看，原来那白色是一朵朵五片花瓣的小花。他把头凑过去，想近距离嗅一嗅花香，这时传来了上山的脚步声。">查看中文翻译</div>
