<div class="line_en">I read my first connected story in May, 1887, when I was seven years old, and from that day to this I have devoured everything in the shape of a printed page that has come within the reach of my hungry finger tips. As I have said, I did not study regularly during the early years of my education; nor did I read according to rule.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have thus far sketched the events of my life, but I have not shown how much I have depended on books not only for pleasure and for the wisdom they bring to all who read, but also for that knowledge which comes to others through their eyes and their ears.

<div class="line_en">At first I had only a few books in raised print --"readers" for beginners, a collection of stories for children, and a book about the earth called "Our World." I think that was all; but I read them over and over, until the words were so worn and pressed I could scarcely make them out. Sometimes Miss Sullivan read to me, spelling into my hand little stories and poems that she knew I should understand; but I preferred reading myself to being read to, because I liked to read again and again the things that pleased me.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day my teacher found me in a corner of the library poring over the pages of "The Scarlet Letter." I was then about eight years old. I remember she asked me if I liked little Pearl, and explained some of the words that had puzzled me. Then she told me that she had a beautiful story about a little boy which she was sure I should like better than "The Scarlet Letter." The name of the story was "Little Lord Fauntleroy," and she promised to read it to me the following summer. But we did not begin the story until August; the first few weeks of my stay at the seashore were so full of discoveries and excitement that I forgot the very existence of books. Then my teacher went to visit some friends in Boston, leaving me for a short time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，在图书馆的一个角落里，我的老师发现我正面对着《红字》的书页若有所思。那时我大约八岁。我记得她问我是否喜欢小珀尔，而且还向我解释了一些晦涩难懂的词句。随后，她对我说她有一本讲述一个小男孩经历的故事书，她保证那本书比《红字》有趣得多，我也一定会喜欢的。那本书的名字叫《小爵爷方特勒罗伊》，她答应接下来的夏天就读给我听。可是一直到了8月份，我们还没有开始看这本书；因为在海边的最初几个星期里，我完全沉浸在猎奇的兴奋之中，以至于忘记了看书这回事。当时我的老师要去波士顿探望一些友人，所以暂时离开了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was during my first visit to Boston that I really began to read in good earnest. I was permitted to spend a part of each day in the Institution library, and to wander from bookcase to bookcase, and take down whatever book my fingers lighted upon. And read I did, whether I understood one word in ten or two words on a page. The words themselves fascinated me; but I took no conscious account of what I read. My mind must, however, have been very impressionable at that period, for it retained many words and whole sentences, to the meaning of which I had not the faintest clue; and afterward, when I began to talk and write, these words and sentences would flash out quite naturally, so that my friends wondered at the richness of my vocabulary. I must have read parts of many books (in those early days I think I never read any one book through) and a great deal of poetry in this uncomprehending way, until I discovered "Little Lord Fauntleroy," which was the first book of any consequence I read understandingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我第一次游览波士顿期间，我才真正开始了阅读生涯。那时，我被允许每天在学院图书馆里消磨一段时间。于是，我徘徊在一个个书架之间，也不管碰到了什么样的书，我拿起来就读。当然，也许在每一页里我只认识一两个词。可以说，令我着迷的正是那些词语本身，而书的内容反倒不在我的考虑之列。即使这样，我对知识的感知能力却十分强大，因为我的很多词汇和句式都是在那时掌握的。虽然对那些词句的含义不甚明了，但是在后来，当我开始学习说话和写字的时候，这些词句竟然自然而然地脱口而出，以至于朋友们对我丰富的词汇量大为惊讶。正是以这种不知不觉的方式，我阅读了大量的书籍（当然，在早期的阅读中，我从来没有把一本书完整地读完）和诗歌，直到我发现《小爵爷方特勒罗伊》——这是我完全读懂的第一本书——我的阅读生涯才算正式开始。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she returned almost the first thing we did was to begin the story of "Little Lord Fauntleroy." I recall distinctly the time and place when we read the first chapters of the fascinating child's story. It was a warm afternoon in August. We were sitting together in a hammock which swung from two solemn pines at a short distance from the house. We had hurried through the dish-washing after luncheon, in order that we might have as long an afternoon as possible for the story. As we hastened through the long grass toward the hammock, the grasshoppers swarmed about us and fastened themselves on our clothes, and I remember that my teacher insisted upon picking them all off before we sat down, which seemed to me an unnecessary waste of time. The hammock was covered with pine needles, for it had not been used while my teacher was away. The warm sun shone on the pine trees and drew out all their fragrance. The air was balmy, with a tang of the sea in it. Before we began the story Miss Sullivan explained to me the things that she knew I should not understand, and as we read on she explained the unfamiliar words. At first there were many words I did not know, and the reading was constantly interrupted; but as soon as I thoroughly comprehended the situation, I became too eagerly absorbed in the story to notice mere words, and I am afraid I listened impatiently to the explanations that Miss Sullivan felt to be necessary. When her fingers were too tired to spell another word, I had for the first time a keen sense of my deprivations. I took the book in my hands and tried to feel the letters with an intensity of longing that I can never forget.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当老师返回时，我们所做的第一件事就是开始阅读《小爵爷方特勒罗伊》。我清楚地记得我们读第一章时的时间和地点。那是8月里一个温暖宜人的下午，我们俩坐在一张摇摆的吊床上，这张吊床就拴在离家不远的两棵大松树之间。午餐过后，我们匆匆涮过盘子，为的是尽可能用整个下午时间看故事书。当我们快步穿过草丛奔向吊床时，受惊的蚱蜢乱飞乱撞，纷纷落在我们身上。我记得老师坚持要先把衣服上的蚱蜢摘掉，然后再坐下看书；可是在我看来，这似乎是毫无必要的浪费时间之举。吊床上面已经落满了松针，因为自老师离开后一直没有人用过这张吊床。和煦的阳光洒落在松树上，空气中弥漫着松针的芳香，同时夹杂着一股独特的海洋气息。在开始读故事之前，苏立文小姐向我解释了一些我不太理解的背景，而且，在阅读过程中，她还要随时向我讲解生词。刚开始时有很多单词我都不认识，阅读因此会常常中断；但是当我完全沉浸在故事情节之中，生词这回事就被我忽略了。对于苏立文小姐认为有必要解释的那些词语，我想我当时听得很不耐烦。后来，因过于疲劳，老师的手指再也拼写不下去了，而我却第一次产生出一种被剥夺了心爱之物的沮丧感。于是，我把书抓在手里，如饥似渴地摸索着书页，我永远也不会忘记那种急切的心情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Afterward, at my eager request, Mr. Anagnos had this story embossed, and I read it again and again, until I almost knew it by heart; and all through my childhood "Little Lord Fauntleroy" was my sweet and gentle companion. I have given these details at the risk of being tedious, because they are in such vivid contrast with my vague, mutable and confused memories of earlier reading.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，在我的迫切请求下，阿纳戈诺斯先生就把这本书制作成了浮点文字。我读了一遍又一遍，几乎达到了烂熟于心的程度。可以说，《小爵爷方特勒罗伊》伴我度过了整个童年时光，而且给我留下了温馨甜蜜的回忆。我之所以冒着招人厌烦的危险提及这些陈年往事，只因为相对于我那蒙昧、善变而混乱的童年记忆而言，这本书的确可以称之为无比生动的一章。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From "Little Lord Fauntleroy" I date the beginning of my true interest in books. During the next two years I read many books at my home and on my visits to Boston. I cannot remember what they all were, or in what order I read them; but I know that among them were "Greek Heroes," La Fontaine's "Fables," Hawthorne's "Wonder Book," "Bible Stories," Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare," "A Child's History of England" by Dickens, "The Arabian Nights," "The Swiss Family Robinson," "The Pilgrim's Progress," "Robinson Crusoe," "Little Women," and "Heidi," a beautiful little story which I afterward read in German. I read them in the intervals between study and play with an ever-deepening sense of pleasure. I did not study nor analyze them -- I did not know whether they were well written or not; I never thought about style or authorship. They laid their treasures at my feet, and I accepted them as we accept the sunshine and the love of our friends. I loved "Little Women" because it gave me a sense of kinship with girls and boys who could see and hear. Circumscribed as my life was in so many ways, I had to look between the covers of books for news of the world that lay outside my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从读过《小爵爷方特勒罗伊》后，我对书籍就产生了真正的兴趣。在其后的两年间，我读了很多书，这些书都是我在家里以及在游览波士顿期间读的。具体读了哪些书，或者是在何种状态下读的，我已经记不清了；不过有一些书我是不会忘的，比如《希腊英雄传》，拉封丹的《寓言》，霍桑的《奇书》、《圣经故事》，兰姆的《莎士比亚故事集》，狄更斯的《英格兰历史儿童读本》，《天方夜谭》，《瑞士人罗宾逊一家》，《天路历程》，《鲁滨孙漂流记》，《小妇人》，还有《海蒂》——这是个美丽的故事，我记得我看的是德文版本。这些书都是在边学边玩之间读完的。当然，自始至终我都怀着强烈的求知欲。当时，我并不会对我所读的书进行研究和分析，我不知道这些书写得是好是坏，我也从来没有想过它们的写作风格和作者背景。就这样，这些书把它们的“财宝”堆放在我的脚前，而我欣然接纳了书籍的馈赠，正如我接纳阳光和朋友们的友谊一样自然而然。我喜欢读《小妇人》，因为它让我意识到了自己同那些能听能看的正常孩子之间的“血缘关系”。由于我的生活受到了种种限制，因此我不得不在书籍之中寻找尚未发掘的新世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, again, La Fontaine seldom, if ever, appeals to our higher moral sense. The highest chords he strikes are those of reason and self-love. Through all the fables runs the thought that man's morality springs wholly from self-love, and that if that self-love is directed and restrained by reason, happiness must follow. Now, so far as I can judge, self-love is the root of all evil; but, of course, I may be wrong, for La Fontaine had greater opportunities of observing men than I am likely ever to have. I do not object so much to the cynical and satirical fables as to those in which momentous truths are taught by monkeys and foxes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着说拉封丹。如果说他的作品带给了我们更高的道德感，我认为这种说法是言过其实的。事实上，其作品中最值得回味的地方就是故事的发生动机和其中蕴涵的自恋主张，所有的寓言无不传达出这样一种思想——人类的道德感完全来自于自恋，假如自恋的动机被压制，那么幸福一定会到来。而我本人的看法是，自恋是一切罪恶的根源。当然，我的判断也许是错的，毕竟，同我相比，拉封丹有着更加丰富的观察人生的经验。此外，我并不太反对寓言所具有的讽刺效果，尤其是通过猴子和狐狸的口传授做人的至理名言。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not care especially for "The Pilgrim's Progress," which I think I did not finish, or for the "Fables." I read La Fontaine's "Fables" first in an English translation, and enjoyed them only after a half-hearted fashion. Later I read the book again in French, and I found that, in spite of the vivid word-pictures, and the wonderful mastery of language, I liked it no better. I do not know why it is, but stories in which animals are made to talk and act like human beings have never appealed to me very strongly. The ludicrous caricatures of the animals occupy my mind to the exclusion of the moral.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我尤其不喜欢《天路历程》，我想我都没有读完这本书。《寓言》我也不喜欢，我最初读的拉封丹的《寓言》是英文版本，当时我只是感觉这本书还说得过去。后来我又读了法文版本，于是我发现，无论书中的文字是多么生动，故事是多么精彩，我还是不太喜欢。我不知道为什么会有这种感觉，不过书中的那些像人类一样会说话的动物从来就没有引起过我太大的兴趣。不妨说，给我留下印象的不过是一些滑稽可笑的动物，而并不是其中的道德说教。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My mind opened naturally and joyously to a conception of antiquity. Greece, ancient Greece, exercised a mysterious fascination over me. In my fancy the pagan gods and goddesses still walked on earth and talked face to face with men, and in my heart I secretly built shrines to those I loved best. I knew and loved the whole tribe of nymphs and heroes and demigods -- no, not quite all, for the cruelty and greed of Medea and Jason were too monstrous to be forgiven, and I used to wonder why the gods permitted them to do wrong and then punished them for their wickedness. And the mystery is still unsolved. I often wonder how</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the Iliad that made Greece my paradise. I was familiar with the story of Troy before I read it in the original, and consequently I had little difficulty in making the Greek words surrender their treasures after I had passed the borderland of grammar. Great poetry, whether written in Greek or in English, needs no other interpreter than a responsive heart. Would that the host of those who make the great works of the poets odious by their analysis, impositions and laborious comments might learn this simple truth! It is not necessary that one should be able to define every word and give it its principal parts and its grammatical position in the sentence in order to understand and appreciate a fine poem. I know my learned professors have found greater riches in the Iliad than I shall ever find; but I am not avaricious. I am content that others should be wiser than I. But with all their wide and comprehensive knowledge, they cannot measure their enjoyment of that splendid epic, nor can I. When I read the finest passages of the Iliad, I am conscious of a soul-sense that lifts me above the narrow, cramping circumstances of my life. My physical limitations are forgotten -- my world lies upward, the length and the breadth and the sweep of the heavens are mine!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可以说，正是《伊利亚特》把古希腊变成了我心目中的天堂。在没有读原著之前，我就已经熟悉了特洛伊的故事。虽然当时我已经穿越了语法的边境线，但是在迫使希腊词语交出它们的“财宝”时，我还遇到了少许的困难。伟大的诗篇，无论用希腊文还是英文写就，它需要的不是讲解员，而是一颗敏感的心。难道不正是有那么一群好事之徒，通过他们所谓的分析而令伟大的诗歌变得面目可憎吗？所以，那些强加于人和艰深晦涩的评论的炮制者，真应该好好学一学这条朴素的真理！事实上，理解和欣赏一部杰出的诗篇，并不需要你去对每一个词的作用，或者是它在句子中的语法结构进行解释。我很清楚，博学的教授们从《伊利亚特》中发掘的财富要远胜于我。我并不是个贪婪的人，我甘愿接受别人比我更聪明的现实。但是即使拥有了渊博的知识，他们却无法揣摩出恢弘史诗所蕴涵的激情。当然，我也揣摩不出来。而当我读了《伊利亚特》中最精彩的篇章以后，我才有了灵魂升华的感觉——我狭隘逼仄的生命得以释放，而身体的局限也已被我淡忘。我的世界也在上升，它浩瀚无边，横扫过重重天际！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My admiration for the Aeneid is not so great, but it is none the less real. I read it as much as possible without the help of notes or dictionary, and I always like to translate the episodes that please me especially. The word-painting of Virgil is wonderful sometimes; but his gods and men move through the scenes of passion and strife and pity and love like the graceful figures in an Elizabethan mask, whereas in the Iliad they give three leaps and go on singing. Virgil is serene and lovely like a marble Apollo in the moonlight; Homer is a beautiful, animated youth in the full sunlight with the wind in his hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我并不十分赞赏《埃涅阿斯纪》这部史诗，但它的真实依然令人动容。在阅读这部作品的时候，我尽量不去借助字典或注释的帮忙，而且，我总是喜欢把我特别喜欢的章节翻译出来。维吉尔的文笔有时的确精彩，但是他笔下的诸神和人类无不游走在激情、冲突、怜悯和情爱之间，就如同伊丽莎白时代化装舞会中的才子佳人。然而，《伊利亚特》中的神祇和人类则欢呼雀跃，纵情歌唱。维吉尔具有沉静而迷人的气质，如同月光之下的一尊阿波罗雕像；而荷马恰如头顶烈日、迎风而立的英武青年。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How easy it is to fly on paper wings! From "Greek Heroes" to the Iliad was no day's journey, nor was it altogether pleasant. One could have traveled round the world many times while I trudged my weary way through the labyrinthine mazes of grammars and dictionaries, or fell into those dreadful pitfalls called examinations, set by schools and colleges for the confusion of those who seek after knowledge. I suppose this sort of Pilgrim's Progress was justified by the end; but it seemed interminable to me, in spite of the pleasant surprises that met me now and then at a turn in the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">I began to read the Bible long before I could understand it. Now it seems strange to me that there should have been a time when my spirit was deaf to its wondrous harmonies; but I remember well a rainy Sunday morning when, having nothing else to do, I begged my cousin to read me a story out of the Bible. Although she did not think I should understand, she began to spell into my hand the story of Joseph and his brothers. Somehow it failed to interest me. The unusual language and repetition made the story seem unreal and far away in the land of Canaan, and I fell asleep and wandered off to the land of Nod, before the brothers came with the coat of many colours unto the tent of Jacob and told their wicked lie! I cannot understand why the stories of the Greeks should have been so full of charm for me, and those of the Bible so devoid of interest, unless it was that I had made the acquaintance of several Greeks in Boston and been inspired by their enthusiasm for the stories of their country; whereas I had not met a single Hebrew or Egyptian, and therefore concluded that they were nothing more than barbarians, and the stories about them were probably all made up, which hypothesis explained the repetitions and the queer names. Curiously enough, it never occurred to me to call Greek patronymics "queer."</div>

<div class="line_en">But how shall I speak of the glories I have since discovered in the Bible? For years I have read it with an ever-broadening sense of joy and inspiration; and I love it as I love no other book. Still there is much in the Bible against which every instinct of my being rebels, so much that I regret the necessity which has compelled me to read it through from beginning to end. I do not think that the knowledge which I have gained of its history and sources compensates me for the unpleasant details it has forced upon my attention. For my part, I wish, with Mr. Howells, that the literature of the past might be purged of all that is ugly and barbarous in it, although I should object as much as any one to having these great works weakened or falsified.</div>

Yet, conquering her woman's fear, she approaches him, animated by the noblest patriotism, having but one thought: "If I perish, I perish; but if I live, my people shall live."</div>

<div class="line_en">The story of Ruth, too -- how Oriental it is! Yet how different is the life of these simple country folks from that of the Persian capital! Ruth is so loyal and gentle-hearted, we cannot help loving her, as she stands with the reapers amid the waving corn. Her beautiful, unselfish spirit shines out like a bright star in the night of a dark and cruel age. Love like Ruth's, love which can rise above conflicting creeds and deep-seated racial prejudices, is hard to find in all the world.</div>

I cannot tell exactly when I began Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare"; but I know that I read them at first with a child's understanding and a child's wonder. "Macbeth" seems to have impressed me most. One reading was sufficient to stamp every detail of the story upon my memory forever. For a long time the ghosts and witches pursued me even into Dreamland. I could see, absolutely see, the dagger and Lady Macbeth's little white hand -- the dreadful stain was as real to me as to the grief-stricken queen.</div>

<div class="line_en">I must have made the acquaintance of Shylock and Satan about the same time, for the two characters were long associated in my mind. I remember that I was sorry for them.

Even now I cannot find it in my heart to condemn them utterly. There are moments when I feel that the Shylocks, the Judases, and even the Devil, are broken spokes in the great wheel of good which shall in due time be made whole.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seems strange that my first reading of Shakespeare should have left me so many unpleasant memories. The bright, gentle, fanciful plays -- the ones I like best now -- appear not to have impressed me at first, perhaps because they reflected the habitual sunshine and gaiety of a child's life. But "there is nothing more capricious than the memory of a child: what it will hold, and what it will lose."</div>

<div class="line_en">I have since read Shakespeare's plays many times and know parts of them by heart, but I cannot tell which of them I like best. My delight in them is as varied as my moods. The little songs and the sonnets have a meaning for me as fresh and wonderful as the dramas. But, with all my love for Shakespeare, it is often weary work to read all the meanings into his lines which critics and commentators have given them. I used to try to remember their interpretations, but they discouraged and vexed me; so I made a secret compact with myself not to try any more. This compact I have only just broken in my study of Shakespeare under Professor Kittredge. I know there are many things in Shakespeare, and in the world, that I do not understand; and I am glad to see veil after veil lift gradually, revealing new realms of thought and beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，我曾多次阅读莎士比亚戏剧，可以说对其中的部分章节熟稔于心，可是我却无法说出我最喜欢哪出戏。我对这些作品的喜爱层次是广泛的，就像我的情绪一样变化多端。在我看来，短小的民谣和十四行诗能够传达出同戏剧一样的神韵。但是另一方面，对莎士比亚的喜爱也增加了我阅读上的困难——读懂评论家和注释者们对每一行诗的阐释确实是一项十分劳累的工作。我试图记住别人的评论，但是那些（蹩脚的）评论每每令我气恼不已，所以，我悄悄地同自己签订了一份“协议”——不再看那些评论。直到接触了吉特莱芝教授开设的莎士比亚课，“协议”才被我打破。我知道，莎士比亚（戏剧）博大精深，而且，我并不了解世界范围内的莎剧研究。我很高兴看到一层层的面纱被人掀起，将一个崭新而美妙的思想王国展现在我们面前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next to poetry I love history. I have read every historical work that I have been able to lay my hands on, from a catalogue of dry facts and dryer dates to Green's impartial, picturesque "History of the English People"; from Freeman's "History of Europe" to Emerton's "Middle Ages." The first book that gave me any real sense of the value of history was Swinton's "World's History," which I received on my thirteenth birthday. Though I believe it is no longer considered valid, yet I have kept it ever since as one of my treasures. From it I learned how the races of men spread from land to land and built great cities, how a few great rulers, earthly Titans, put everything under their feet, and with a decisive word opened the gates of happiness for millions and closed them upon millions more: how different nations pioneered in art and knowledge and broke ground for the mightier growths of coming ages; how civilization underwent, as it were, the holocaust of a degenerate age, and rose again, like the Phoenix, among the nobler sons of the North; and how by liberty, tolerance and education the great and the wise have opened the way for the salvation of the whole world.</div>

The German puts strength before beauty, and truth before convention, both in life and in literature. There is a vehement, sledge-hammer vigour about everything that he does.

<div class="line_en">I am afraid I have written too much about my book-friends, and yet I have mentioned only the authors I love most; and from this fact one might easily suppose that my circle of friends was very limited and undemocratic, which would be a very wrong impression. I like many writers for many reasons -- Carlyle for his ruggedness and scorn of shams; Wordsworth, who teaches the oneness of man and nature; I find an exquisite pleasure in the oddities and surprises of Hood, in Herrick's quaintness and the palpable scent of lily and rose in his verses; I like Whittier for his enthusiasms and moral rectitude. I knew him, and the gentle remembrance of our friendship doubles the pleasure I have in reading his poems. I love Mark Twain -- who does not? The gods, too, loved him and put into his heart all manner of wisdom; then, fearing lest he should become a pessimist, they spanned his mind with a rainbow of love and faith. I like Scott for his freshness, dash and large honesty. I love all writers whose minds, like Lowell's, bubble up in the sunshine of optimism -- fountains of joy and good will, with occasionally a splash of anger and here and there a healing spray of sympathy and pity.</div>
