<div class="line_en">"Oh, his name is Morris Townsend, is it?" the Doctor said. He looked at Catherine. "And did he come here to ask you to marry him?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"The gentleman at Elizabeth's party who liked Catherine so much," said Mrs Penniman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“伊丽莎白晚会上的那个年轻人，他很喜欢凯瑟琳。”彭尼曼夫人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half an hour after the two young men had left, Doctor Sloper came into the parlour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个年轻人走后半个小时，斯洛珀医生进了客厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This time it's for you -- for you only," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这次是为你而来——只为你一个人。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr Morris Townsend has just been here, Austin," Mrs Penniman told her brother. "What a pity you missed him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“莫里斯·汤森先生刚来过，奥斯汀，”彭尼曼夫人对弟弟说，“可惜你没见到。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, father!" murmured Catherine, turning away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，爸爸！”凯瑟琳低声埋怨着，转身走开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope he won't do that without your permission," said Mrs Penniman.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who in the world is Mr Morris Townsend?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“莫里斯·汤森先生到底是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morris Townsend came again five days later, but Doctor Sloper was not at home at the time. Catherine was with her aunt when a servant announced the young man's name. Mrs Penniman sent her niece into the parlour alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五天后莫里斯·汤森再次来访，不过当时斯洛珀医生刚好不在家。仆人通报来客姓名的时候，凯瑟琳正和她姑姑在一起。彭尼曼夫人让侄女独自到客厅里去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My dear, he seems to have yours," her brother answered. "The next time he comes, you should call me. He might like to see me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的，他好像已经得到你的同意了。”她弟弟回答道，“下次他来的时候，你应该叫上我。他也许乐意见我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Catherine saw Mr Townsend alone, sitting with him in the front parlour, for more than an hour. He seemed more at home this time -- making himself very comfortable and looking around with interest at the room and the furniture. His talk was light, easy and friendly. "Tell me about yourself," he said to her, with his charming smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以凯瑟琳独自一人和汤森先生相见，他们在前厅坐了一个多小时。他这次似乎更随意——他很放松，饶有兴致地打量着房间和家具。他的谈话也轻松、随意而且友好。“跟我说说你自己吧。”他对她说，露出了迷人的笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went on to talk about his great love of music and singing. "I sing a little myself," he added; "some day I will show you. Not today, but some other time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续讲他有多么喜爱音乐和歌唱。“我自己也唱唱歌，”他加了一句，“改天我唱给你听。今天不行了，改天。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catherine had very little to tell, but she told him of her love of music and the theatre, and how she did not really enjoy reading. Morris Townsend agreed with her that books were boring -- he had been to places that people had written about, and they were not at all as they had been described. He had also seen all the famous actors in London and Paris, but the actors were always like the writers they were never true to real life. He liked everything to be natural. Suddenly he stopped, looking at Catherine with his smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯瑟琳没多少可说的，不过她还是告诉他自己对音乐和戏剧的热爱，以及她不那么喜欢读书。莫里斯·汤森同意她的看法，认为书很枯燥——他去过书里提到的那些地方，跟书中描写的一点儿都不一样。伦敦和巴黎所有的著名演员他也都见过，这些演员和那些作家都一个样——都不忠实于真实的生活。他喜欢一切自然的东西。突然，他停了下来，面带微笑地看着凯瑟琳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's what I like you for; you are so natural," he said. "You see I am natural myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是我喜欢你的地方；你这么淳朴。”他说，“你看，我本人并不矫揉造作。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then he got up to go. He had perhaps talked more about himself than about Catherine, but the truth was that Catherine had not noticed. She was thinking only that "some other time" had a delightful sound. It seemed to suggest many more meetings in the future.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他就站起来走了。也许他谈论自己比谈论凯瑟琳还多，不过实际上凯瑟琳根本没注意到。她只是在想“改天”会听到令人愉快的歌声。这似乎意味着以后他们还会见很多次。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Catherine felt it was her duty to tell her father that Mr Morris Townsend had called again -- though it made her feel ashamed and uncomfortable. She announced the fact very suddenly, as soon as the Doctor came into the house, and then immediately tried to leave the room. Her father stopped her just as she reached the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯瑟琳觉得自己有责任把莫里斯·汤森先生再次造访的事情告诉父亲——尽管这使她感到害臊和不安。医生一进屋，她就突然宣布了这件事，然后就想立刻离开房间。她刚走到门口就被她父亲拦住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, my dear, did he ask you to marry him today?" the Doctor said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，亲爱的，他今天向你求婚了吗？”医生说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catherine had no answer ready. She wanted to be amused, as her father was amused, but she also wanted to be a little sharp, so that he would not ask the question again. She did not like it -- it made her unhappy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯瑟琳对这个问题毫无准备。她想愉快点儿，像她父亲那样，但她还想尖刻点儿，这样他就不会再问这个问题了。她不喜欢这个问题——这令她不愉快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps he will do it next time," she said, with a little laugh; and she quickly got out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许下次他会这么做。”她轻轻一笑，说道；然后迅速离开了房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lavinia has already been to ask me about him," Mrs Almond said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拉维尼娅已经向我问过他的情况了。”阿尔蒙德夫人说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Doctor stood staring. He wondered whether his daughter was serious, and decided to find out more about this handsome young man. The next time he saw his sister Elizabeth, he asked her about Morris Townsend.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就是我跟你说的——我对他不太了解。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How disappointing for Lavinia," said the Doctor. "She would like him to have some romantic secret in his past. I hear that he is a distant cousin of Arthur Townsend."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拉维尼娅该有多失望啊，”医生说，“她希望他过去的人生经历中会有一些浪漫的秘密。我听说他是阿瑟·汤森的远房表兄。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He hasn't got any; he is looking for something. I believe he was once in the Navy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他没工作；正在找事做。我想他以前在海军服过役。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, though it seems that there are Townsends and Townsends -- some rather better than others. Arthur's mother knows very little about him; only some story that he has been 'wild' in the past. I know his sister a little. Her name is Mrs Montgomery; she is a widow, with five children and not much money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，不过好像到处都是姓汤森的人——有一些比另一些要好多了。阿瑟的母亲对他也不太了解；只有一些传闻说他以前曾经‘野’过一阵。他姐姐的情况我也知道一点儿。她叫蒙哥马利夫人；是个寡妇，带着五个孩子，没什么钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is his profession?" asked the Doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是干什么的？”医生问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Once? What is his age?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“以前？他多大了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"More than thirty, I think. Arthur told me that he inherited a little money -- which is perhaps why he left the Navy -- and that he spent it all in a few years. He travelled all over the world, lived in foreign countries, amused himself. He has recently come back to America, and he told Arthur that he now wants to start his life seriously."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“30多岁吧，我想。阿瑟告诉我他继承了一点儿钱——也许就是因为这个他才离开海军的——没出几年他就把这笔钱花光了。他周游世界，住在国外，活得挺快活。他最近才回美国，他告诉阿瑟现在他想认认真真地过日子了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't see why you are surprised," said Mrs Almond. "It seems to me that you have never been fair to Catherine. You must remember that she will one day have thirty thousand dollars a year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不明白你为什么感到惊讶，”阿尔蒙德夫人说，“我觉得你从来没有公平地对待过凯瑟琳。你应该记住将来有一天凯瑟琳会有一年3万美元的进项。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么他对凯瑟琳是认真的喽？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么汤森先生呢？他为什么会追求凯瑟琳？他真的喜欢她吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Almond blushed. "I don't mean that is the only good thing about her; I simply mean that it is important. You seem to think that nobody will ever want to marry her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔蒙德夫人的脸一下子红了：“我不是说她只有那一样好处；我只是想说那很重要。你好像觉得没人愿意娶她似的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why should I think differently, Elizabeth?" the Doctor said. "How many young men have come courting Catherine, even with her expected fortune? None -- which is why Lavinia is so charmed that there is now a lover in the house. It is the first time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么我会和你想的不同呢，伊丽莎白？”医生说，“就算凯瑟琳将来会有这么一笔财富，又有多少年轻人来追求她呢？一个也没有——所以拉维尼娅才会这么热衷，家里现在来了个情人。这可是头一次。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think young men are rather afraid of Catherine," said the Doctor's wiser sister. "She seems older than they are -- she is so large, and she dresses so richly. An older, more experienced man would recognize all the good things in her character, and would find her delightful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得小伙子们都很害怕凯瑟琳，”医生的这位更聪明的妹妹说，“她看起来比他们大——她个头这么大，穿得又华丽。只有年龄大一点儿、经验更丰富的男人才会发现她性格中所有那些美好的东西，也才会发现她是个惹人喜爱的姑娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The next time he comes," he told Mrs Penniman, "you must invite him to dinner."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have no idea. He lives with his sister and her children on Second Avenue."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道。他和他姐姐还有她的孩子们一起住在第二大道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Doctor Sloper was more amused than annoyed by the idea of Mr Townsend courting his daughter. He was quite willing to believe the best of the young man. And if he was a sincere, honest man, it did not matter if he was poor, since Catherine had no need of a rich husband.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到汤森先生追求他的女儿，斯洛珀医生与其说是生气倒不如说是感到有趣。他很愿意往最好的地方去想这个年轻人。如果他真心实意，为人又诚实，那么他穷点儿也没关系，反正凯瑟琳并不需要一个有钱的丈夫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps I will," said the Doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许我会去的。”医生说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Penniman was happy to pass on her brother's invitation, which Morris Townsend accepted, and the dinner was arranged. Two or three other people were invited as well, and although Doctor Sloper talked very little to the young man during the meal, he watched him carefully. At the end of the meal, when the ladies had gone up to the parlour, leaving the men to their drinking, the Doctor gave him some wine and asked him several questions. Morris Townsend was happy to talk, and the Doctor sat quietly, watching his bright, handsome face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彭尼曼夫人很高兴地转达了弟弟的邀请，莫里斯·汤森接受了邀请，晚宴也安排下了。还邀请了两三个其他的人，虽然斯洛珀医生在进餐时没跟这个年轻人说什么话，他还是仔细地观察了他。晚餐到了最后，女士们都到客厅里去了，留下男人们继续喝酒，医生给他倒了一些葡萄酒，又问了他几个问题。莫里斯·汤森喜欢说话，医生静静地坐在那里，看着他那快乐英俊的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
