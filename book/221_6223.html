<div class="line_en">She floated around the house looking a bit lost for three days, then she began spring cleaning with a vigour that frightened even Granddad. He would mouth gummy protests at her as she tried to vacuum under the chair that he was still sitting in, or flick at his shoulders with her duster. Treena had said she wouldn't come home for the first few weeks, just to give Thomas a chance to settle. When she rang each evening, Mum would speak to them and then cry for a full half-hour in her bedroom afterwards.</div>

<div class="line_en">Treena had moved out the previous weekend (minus my lemons washbag -- I retrieved that the night before she went). Mum was devastated; it was actually worse than when Treena had gone to university the first time around. She missed Thomas like an amputated limb. His toys, which had littered the living-room floor since babyhood, were boxed up and put away. There were no chocolate fingers or small cartons of drink in the cupboard. She no longer had a reason to walk to the school at 3.15pm, nobody to chat to on the short walk home. It had been the only time Mum ever really spent outside the house. Now she went nowhere at all, apart from the weekly supermarket shop with Dad.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was earning more than I had ever earned in my life. I doubled the amount I gave my parents, put some aside into a savings account every month, and I was still left with more than I could spend. Part of it was, I worked so many hours that I was never away from Granta House when the shops were open. The other was, simply, that I didn't really have an appetite for spending. The spare hours I did have I had started to spend in the library, looking things up on the internet.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wrote the card, and posted it. I said nothing more about it. But that evening, Will's words still echoing around my head, I found myself diverting into the library and, spying an unused computer, I logged on to the internet. I looked up whether there were any devices that Will could use to do his own writing. Within an hour, I had come up with three -- a piece of voice recognition software, another type of software which relied on the blinking of an eye, and, as my sister had mentioned, a tapping device that Will could wear on his head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even Mrs Traynor couldn't find anything to complain about. "If there is any other equipment that you think might be useful," she said, her lips still pursed as if she couldn't quite believe this might have been a straightforwardly good thing, "do let us know." She eyed Will nervously, as if he might actually be about to wrench it off with his jaw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算是特雷纳夫人也没什么可抱怨的。“要是有其他你觉得会有用的设备，”她说，她的嘴唇依然撅起，仿佛她不能十分相信这完完全全是件好事，“一定要告诉我们。”她紧张地看着威尔，仿佛他就要用下巴把设备拔掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was predictably sniffy about the head device, but he conceded that the voice recognition software might be useful, and within a week we managed, with Nathan's help, to install it on his computer, setting Will up so that with the computer tray fixed to his chair, he no longer needed someone else to type for him. He was a bit self-conscious about it initially, but after I instructed him to begin everything with, "Take a letter, Miss Clark," he got over it.</div>

<div class="line_en">After years spent in that box room, my clothes perched on a rail in the hallway outside, Treena's bedroom felt palatial. The first night I spent in it I spun round with my arms outstretched, just luxuriating in the fact that I couldn't touch both walls simultaneously. I went to the DIY store and bought paint and new blinds, as well as a new bedside light and some shelves, which I assembled myself. It's not that I'm good at that stuff; I guess I just wanted to see if I could do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那间储藏室待了这么多年，我的衣服一直放在过道外面的栏杆上，特丽娜的卧室感觉像是宫殿。待在那儿的第一晚，我张开双臂在里面旋转，再也不用同时碰到两边的墙壁，这让我心情无比畅快。我去自助商店买了油漆和新窗帘，一盏新的床头灯和要自己组装的一些架子。我并不擅长做这些，我就是想看看我是不是能做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I set about redecorating, painting for an hour a night after I came home from work, and at the end of the week even Dad had to admit I'd done a really good job.

And the box room was somewhere they were only going to sleep. There was no point in the larger room being empty for weeks on end.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went to work each day, thinking about other places I could take Will. I didn't have any overall plan, I just focused each day on getting him out and about and trying to keep him happy. There were some days -- days when his limbs burnt, or when infection claimed him and he lay miserable and feverish in bed -- that were harder than others. But on the good days I had managed several times to get him out into the spring sunshine. I knew now that one of the things Will hated most was the pity of strangers, so I drove him to local beauty spots, where for an hour or so it could be just the two of us. I made picnics and we sat out on the edges of fields, just enjoying the breeze and being away from the annexe.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of the meal passed off without incident. My parents, I could see, were completely charmed by Will. Patrick, less so. He and Will barely exchanged another word. Somewhere around the point where Mum served up the roast potatoes -- Dad doing his usual thing of trying to steal extras -- I stopped worrying. Dad was asking Will all sorts, about his life before, even about the accident, and he seemed comfortable enough to answer him directly. In fact, I learnt a fair bit that he'd never told me. His job, for example, sounded pretty important, even if he played it down. He bought and sold companies and made sure he turned a profit while doing so. It took Dad a few attempts to prise out of him that his idea of profit ran into six or seven figures. I found myself staring at Will, trying to reconcile the man I knew with this ruthless City suit that he now described. Dad told him about the company that was about to take over the furniture factory, and when he said the name Will nodded almost apologetically, and said that yes, he knew of them. Yes, he would probably have gone for it too. The way he said it didn't sound promising for Dad's job.</div>

More recently, there was a picture of me and Patrick, the one where I was actually telling him to piss off. And me, dressed in a grey skirt, my first day in my new job. In between the pages were pictures of our family by Thomas, letters that Mum had kept from school trips, my childish handwriting telling of days on the beach, lost ice creams and thieving gulls. I flicked through, and only hesitated briefly when I saw the girl with the long, dark flicked-back hair. I turned the page.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="帕特里克的瞪视意味深长。最后，他不再看我，脱下他的袜子，扔到洗衣篮。“你的工作不应该是这些。说过没有医疗方面的事情的，没有亲密接触。这跟你的职位描述不符。”他突然又想到了一点什么，“你可以起诉。蓄意解雇，我觉得是。他们是什么时候改变你的工作条款的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't be ridiculous. And I do it because Nathan can't always be there, and it's horrible for Will to have some complete stranger from an agency handling him. And besides, I'm used to it now. It really doesn't bother me."</div>

<div class="line_en">How could I explain to him -- how a body can become so familiar to you? I could change Will's tubes with a deft professionalism, sponge bathe his naked top half without a break in our conversation. I didn't even balk at Will's scars now. For a while, all I had been able to see was a potential suicide. Now he was just Will -- maddening, mercurial, clever, funny Will -- who patronized me and liked to play Professor Higgins to my Eliza Doolittle. His body was just part of the whole package, a thing to be dealt with, at intervals, before we got back to the talking. It had become, I supposed, the least interesting part of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我该怎样解释给他听——一个身体怎样对你变得熟悉起来？我可以非常专业灵巧地换威尔的管子，用海绵擦洗他光着的上半身，与此同时，保持与他的谈话。现在连威尔的伤疤都不会让我退缩。过去，我能看到的只是潜在的自杀，现在他只是威尔——让人恼火、反复无常、聪明、有趣的威尔——喜欢教训我，喜欢玩希金斯教授对伊莱莎•杜利特尔那一套。他的身体只是整个组件的一部分，在我们重新谈话之前，不时要处理的一件事情。我觉得，身体已经成为他最无趣的一部分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Patrick made love to me that night. Perhaps "made love" is stretching it a bit. We had sex, a marathon session in which he seemed determined to show off his athleticism, his strength and vigour. It lasted for hours. If he could have swung me from a chandelier I think he would have done so. It was nice to feel so wanted, to find myself the focus of Patrick's attention after months of semi-detachment. But a little part of me stayed aloof during the whole thing. I suspected it wasn't for me, after all. I had worked that out pretty quickly. This little show was for Will's benefit.</div>
