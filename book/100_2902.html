<div class="line_en">Dexter sat in his seat in the very last carriage of the stationary train and waited for the other passengers to leave. He had no suitcase, just a small overnight bag on the seat next to him. On the table in front of him lay a brightly coloured paperback, on the cover a scratchy cartoon of a girl's face beneath the title Big Julie Criscoll Versus the Whole Wide World.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma Morley got to the arrival gate at the Gare du Nord in good time and joined the crowd, the anxious lovers clutching flowers, the bored chauffeurs, sweaty in suits with their handwritten signs. Might it be funny to hold up a sign with Dexter's name on? she wondered. Perhaps with his name spelt incorrectly? It might make him laugh, she supposed, but was it worth the effort? Besides, the train was pulling in now, the waiting crowd edging towards the gate in anticipation. A long hiatus before the doors hissed open, then the passengers spilled out onto the platform and Emma pressed forward with the friends and families, lovers and chauffeurs, all craning to see the arriving faces.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had finished the book just as the train entered the Paris suburbs. It was the first novel he had finished in some months, his sense of mental prowess mitigated by the fact that the book was aimed at eleven- to fourteen-year-olds and contained pictures. Waiting for the carriage to clear, he turned once more to the inside of the back cover and the black and white photograph of the author and looked at it intently, as if committing her face to memory. In an expensive-looking crisp white shirt she sat a little awkwardly on the edge of a bentwood chair, her hand covering her mouth at just the moment that she burst into laughter. He recognised the expression and the gesture too, smiled, and placed the book in his bag, picked it up and joined the last few passengers as they waited to step down onto the platform.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="书在列车进人巴黎城郊时便已看完，数月来他还未如此完整地读过一本小说。它的读者当是青少年，还配有插图，无意中打击了他的精神优越感。趁着最后的工夫，他再次翻到封三，盯着作者的黑白照，似乎要把她的脸铭刻于心。貌似昂贵的轻薄白衬衫，坐在曲木摇椅边缘的笨拙姿势，遮在将要大笑的嘴上的手。这副表情姿态他都记得，会心一笑，将书收起，提起包走向月台。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While she waited she played with her hair, willing it to grow longer. Shortly after arriving in Paris, dictionary in hand, she had plucked up the courage to go to a hairdresser -- un coiffeur -- to have her hair cropped. Though embarrassed to say it out loud, she had wanted to look like Jean Seberg in A Bout de Souffle, because after all if you're going to be a novelist in Paris you might as well do it properly. Now three weeks later, she no longer wanted to cry when she saw her reflection, but even so her hands kept going to her head as if adjusting a wig. With a conscious effort she turned her attention to the buttons on her brand new dove grey shirt, bought that morning from a shop, no, a boutique, on Rue de Grenelle. Two buttons undone looked too prim, three undone showed cleavage. She unfastened the third button, clicked her tongue and turned her attention back to the passengers. The crowd was thinning out now and she was starting to wonder if he had missed the train when she finally saw him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked broken. Gaunt and tired, his face was shaded with scrappy stubble that didn't suit him, a prison beard, and she was reminded of the potential for disaster that this visit carried with it. But when he saw her he started to smile and quicken his pace, and she smiled too, then started to feel self-conscious as she waited at the gate wondering what to do with her hands, her eyes. The distance between them seemed immense; smile and stare, smile and stare for fifty metres? Forty-five metres. She looked at the floor, up into the rafters. Forty metres, she looked back at Dexter, back at the floor. Thirty-five metres…</div>

<div class="line_en">While covering this vast distance, he was surprised to notice how much she had changed in the eight weeks since he had last seen her, the two months since everything had happened. Her hair had been cut very short, a fringe brushed across her forehead, and she had more colour in her face; the summer face that he remembered. Better dressed too: high shoes, a smart dark skirt, a pale grey shirt unbuttoned a touch too far, showing brown skin and a triangle of dark freckles below her neck. She still didn't seem to know what to do with her hands or where to look, and he was starting to feel self-conscious too. Ten metres. What would he say, and how would he say it? Was it a yes or no?</div>

<div class="line_en">In anticipation of this journey, Emma had memorised a scenic walk, or as scenic as possible in the dust and traffic of the north-east. I'm moving to Paris for the summer, to write. Back in April, the idea had seemed almost embarrassingly precious and fey, but she was so bored with married couples telling her that she could go to Paris at any time that she had decided actually to do it. London had turned into one enormous crèche, so why not get away from other people's children for a while, have an adventure? The city of Sartre and De Beauvoir, Beckett and Proust, and here she was too, writing teenage fiction, albeit with considerable commercial success. The only way she could make the idea seem less hokey was to settle as far away as she could from tourist Paris, in the working-class 19th arrondissement on the border of Belleville and Ménilmontant. No tourist attractions, few landmarks…</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked on, and gradually their mood lifted. The blanket of cloud had broken and Faubourg St-Denis was taking on a new lease of life as the evening began. Scrappy, gaudy and full of noise and life, parts of it almost souk-like, Emma kept stealing glances at Dexter, an anxious tour guide. They crossed the wide bustling Boulevard de Belleville and continued east along the border of the 19th and 20th. Climbing the hill, Emma pointed out the bars she liked, talked about the local history, Piaf and the Paris Commune of 1871, the local Chinese and North African communities, and Dexter half-listened, half-wondered what would happen when they finally arrived at her flat. Listen, Emma, about what happened…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们继续走着，情绪也渐渐高涨。浓云散去，暮色降临，生活似乎翻开了新篇章。四周杂而不乱，热热闹闹，充满了生活气息，有的地方简直像露天市场。爱玛不住地偷眼看德克斯特，她是位焦躁的导游。他们穿过宽阔而繁忙的贝尔维尔大道，继续沿着十九区和二十区相交处向东走去。爬上山坡，爱玛指点着她喜欢的几个酒吧，谈说着当地的历史、歌手比阿夫和一八七一年的巴黎公社、华人和北非人的社区。德克斯特心不在焉地听着，想着到公寓会发生什么。爱玛：对于发生的事情…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually they turned down a quiet side street and came to what looked like a garage door where Emma punched a code into a panel and pressed against the heavy gate with her shoulder. They entered into an enclosed courtyard, cluttered and rundown and overlooked by apartments on all sides. Washing hung from rusting balconies, shabby pot plants wilted in the evening sun. The courtyard echoed with the noise of competing TVs and children playing soccer with a tennis ball, and Dexter fought down a little shiver of irritation. Rehearsing this occasion, he had pictured a tree-shaded square, louvred windows, a view of Notre-Dame perhaps. This was all fine enough, chic even in an urban, industrial way, but something more romantic would have made this all a little easier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他们走上了一条安静的小巷，来到一个好似车库门的东西前。爱玛在键盘上输进了一个密码，然后肩膀抵着沉重的大门推开。他们走进一个封闭的小院子，院中凌乱破旧，头顶四个方向都是阁楼公寓。锈迹斑驳的晒台上晾着衣服，破烂花盆中裁种的植物在夕阳下一派凋敝。院子里回荡着各户电视机的声音，孩子们正踢一个网球，德克斯特受了点刺激，克制着轻微的颤抖。这一刻他预演了多少次，想象自己置身绿树成荫的广场，或者能从白叶窗远眺巴黎圣母院的房间。现在这样也不赖，市郊的小别致，流淌着工业化的气息，要是再来些浪漫的因素就好受多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She pressed the light switch, which was on a timer, and they began the steep ascent of the wrought-iron stairs, tightly curled and seemingly sheering away from the wall in places. Emma was suddenly conscious of the fact that Dexter's eyes were exactly level with her backside and she began nervously reaching back to her skirt to smooth down creases that weren't there. As they reached the landing of the third floor the timer of the light clicked off, and they found themselves in darkness for a moment, Emma fumbling behind her to find his hand, and leading him up the stairs until they stood outside a door. In the dim light from the transom, they smiled at each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她打开灯，带着他沿着生铁楼梯攀登，台阶密密地贴着墙螺旋向上，仿佛呈垂直上延。爱玛忽然意识到德克斯特的眼睛几乎正对着自己的臀部，于是伸手去抚裙子，紧张得像是那单开了条缝。他们来到三楼的楼梯平台，电灯自动暗了下来，两人在黑暗里待了片刻，爱玛朝身后摸索着牵起他的手，直到走过一扇门出到楼梯间外。在百叶窗透进来的微光中，他们相视微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From her bag, she produced an immense bunch of keys, and began work on a complex sequence of locks. After some time the door opened onto a small but pleasant flat with scuffed grey-painted floorboards, a large baggy sofa and a small neat desk overlooking the courtyard, its walls lined with austere-looking books in French, the spines a uniform pale yellow. Fresh roses and fruit stood on the table in a small adjoining kitchen, and through another door Dexter could glimpse the bedroom. They had yet to discuss the sleeping arrangements, but he could see the apartment's only bed, a large cast-iron affair, quaint and cumbersome like something from a farmhouse. One bedroom, one bed. Evening sunlight shone through the windows, drawing attention to the fact of it. He glanced at the sofa to check that it didn't fold out into anything. Nope. One bed. He could feel the blood pumping in his chest, though perhaps this was just from the long climb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从手袋里掏出一大串五花八门的钥匙。门终于开了，眼前出现小巧宜人的公寓，磨损的灰漆地板，松垮的大沙发，齐整的小书桌，临桌能望见楼下的小院，贴墙排列的平装法语书，书脊一溜淡黄。小厨房与客厅相连，里面有张摆着玫瑰和水果的桌子。另一扇门里便是卧室。他们没有讨论过睡觉如何安排，但德克斯特发现公寓里只有一张大铁架床，样式古怪笨重，像是从农场搬来。他最留意的便是余晖缕缕的卧室，以及一张床。他扫了一眼沙发，它并不能作床用。只有一张床。他感到血脉贲张，当然，这也许是因为爬了楼的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>

She had begun to drink, taking great gulps, when suddenly Dexter's hand was on her shoulder, then he was in front of her somehow, and kissing her. Her mouth still full of the effervescing water, she pursed her lips tight to prevent it squirting in his face like a soda siphon. Leaning away, she pointed at her cheeks, absurdly ballooned like a puffer fish, flapped her hands and made a noise that approximated to "hold on a moment".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，这儿是厨房。”爬了楼，再加神经紧张，爱玛口渴了。她从冰箱里拿出一瓶苏打水大口起来，忽然感到一只手搭在肩上。他不知怎的站在她面前，吻着她。她满嘴冒着气泡的水，紧闭着双唇，努力不把苏打水喷在他脸上。终于她身子一倾，摆脱了他，伸手指着鼓成气球般的腮帮子——活像一条河豚。她扇着手掌，嘴里咕哝着说：“等一会儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could see her through the gap in the door. She was sitting at a small 1950s dressing table, her short hair still wet from the shower, wearing a knee-length old-fashioned black silk dress, unzipped at the back to the base of her spine, opened wide enough to see the shade beneath her shoulder blades. She sat motionless and erect and rather elegant, as if waiting for someone to come and zip the dress up, and there was something so appealing about the idea, something so intimate and satisfying about that simple gesture, both familiar and new, that he almost stepped straight into the room. He would fasten the dress, then kiss the curve between her neck and her shoulder and tell her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他能从门缝里窥见她。她正坐在一张五十年代风格的小梳妆台前，湿漉漉的短发，齐膝的旧款黑丝裙，后脊几乎整个光裸，连肩胛骨投在背上的影子都看得清清楚楚。她一动不动，优雅地挺坐，似乎在等着谁把背后的拉链拉上去。这个姿势太撩人了，简简单单，却那么宜人，那么让人满足，既熟悉又陌生。他差点就直奔进房间去。去整理好她的裙子，吻她颈和肩的曲线，然后真情告白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead he watched silently as she reached for a book on the dressing table, a large well-thumbed French/English dictionary. She began to leaf through the pages then stopped suddenly, her head slumping forwards, both hands spanning her brow and pushing her fringe back as she groaned angrily. Dexter laughed at her exasperation, silently he thought, but she glanced towards the door and he quickly stepped backwards. The floorboards popped beneath his feet as he pranced absurdly towards the kitchen area, running both taps and moving cups around uselessly under running water as an alibi. After a while he heard the ting of the old-fashioned phone being picked up in the bedroom, and he turned off the taps so that he might overhear the conversation with this Jean-Pierre. A low, lover's murmur, in French. He strained to listen, failing to understand a single word.</div>
