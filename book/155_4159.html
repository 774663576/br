<div class="line_en">Sighing, I scooped up the small creature, placed him on the bottom step and went back to my cot. September had come, but not a trace of cool weather with it, and we were still sleeping on the back screen porch. Lightning bugs were still about, the night crawlers and flying insects that beat against the screen the summer long had not gone wherever they go when autumn comes.</div>

<div class="line_en">I lay on my stomach, reached down and poked him. He rolled up. Then, feeling safe, I suppose, he slowly unrolled. He traveled a few inches on his hundred legs and I touched him again. He rolled up. Feeling sleepy, I decided to end things. My hand was going down on him when Jem spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我俯卧在床上，伸手捅了它一下，那小虫立即缩成一个球。过了一会儿，我想它一定是感到平安无事了，又慢慢地展开身子，用它那成百只脚爬行了几英寸。我又捅了它一下，它又缩起来。我感到疲倦了，想把它弄死了事，我正要下手，杰姆开口了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A roly-poly had found his way inside the house; I reasoned that the tiny varmint had crawled up the steps and under the door. I was putting my book on the floor beside my cot when I saw him. The creatures are no more than an inch long, and when you touch them they roll themselves into a tight gray ball.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在屋里发现了一条圆滚滚的小爬虫。我想它是爬上台阶再从门下爬进来的。我把书往床头地上放时发现了它。这种小家伙只有一英寸长，用手挨一下它会立即紧紧地缩成一个灰色的小球。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆皱着眉头，沉着脸。他这种表现可能是他正在经历的一个成长阶段。我希望他加把劲，赶快度过这个阶段。说来也是，他对动物从来就不狠心，不过我还不知道，他慈善得可以拥抱昆虫世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day, not I. Comfortable, I lay on my back and waited for sleep, and while waiting I thought of Dill. He had left us the first of the month with firm assurances that he would return the minute school was out -- he guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to spend his summers in Maycomb. Miss Rachel took us with them in the taxi to Maycomb Junction, and Dill waved to us from the train window until he was out of sight. He was not out of mind: I missed him. The last two days of his time with us, Jem had taught him to swim --</div>

<div class="line_en">Barker's Eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the Meridian highway about a mile from town. It is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passing motorist, and the short walk to the creek is easy, but the prospect of walking all the way back home at dusk, when the traffic is light, is tiresome, and swimmers are careful not to stay too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴克·埃迪河湾离城约莫一公里，在一条大道的尽头，这条大道是通往梅里迪安的公路的岔道，可以随便爬上一辆运棉花的马车，或者一辆过路的汽车到那里去。从公路到河湾的路程不远，走起来也容易。但是，在黄昏时分公路上车子很少的时候，乘不上车，从河湾一直走回来那就真够呛！。所以，去游泳的人都注意不呆得太晚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">According to Dill, he and Jem had just come to the highway when they saw Atticus driving toward them. He looked like he had not seen them, so they both waved. Atticus finally slowed down; when they caught up with him he said, "You'd better catch a ride back. I won't be going home for a while." Calpurnia was in the back seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪尔说，那天，他和杰姆刚从河湾走上公路就看见阿迪克斯开着车朝他们驶来。阿迪克斯好像没看见他们，所以他俩一起挥手。阿迪克斯放慢速度停下车，他们跑上前去，阿迪克斯说：“你们最好另找一辆车回家，因为我这会儿不回去。叫卡尔珀尼亚坐在车的后排座位上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They turned off the highway, rode slowly by the dump and past the Ewell residence, down the narrow lane to the Negro cabins. Dill said a crowd of black children were playing marbles in Tom's front yard. Atticus parked the car and got out. Calpurnia followed him through the front gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们转弯离开公路，沿着垃圾场慢慢行驶，经过尤厄尔家，穿过狭窄的小巷来到黑人住宅区。迪尔说，一群黑孩子在汤姆家前面的院子里玩弹子游戏。阿迪克斯停车走出来，卡尔珀尼亚跟着他进了前门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at Atticus. Dill said her hair was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails, each ending in a bright bow. She grinned from ear to ear and walked toward our father, but she was too small to navigate the steps. Dill said Atticus went to her, took off his hat, and offered her his finger. She grabbed it and he eased her down the steps. Then he gave her to Calpurnia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小姑娘从小屋里出来，站在门口望着阿迪克斯。迪尔说，她的头发编成许多条硬邦邦的小辫子，每一条辫梢上有一只美丽的蝴蝶结。她向我们的爸爸走来，满面笑容，但是她太小，下不了门前的台阶。据迪尔说，阿迪克斯走过去，摘下帽子，伸出一个指头，这小姑娘抓住他的指头，让他引着慢慢走下台阶，然后他把她交给了卡尔珀尼亚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few more details, enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn, then nothing to talk about until The Maycomb Tribune appeared the following Thursday. There was a brief obituary in the Colored News, but there was also an editorial.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一些详细的情况，听话者可以借此把事情转告别人。其余再没有什么新鲜事了。星期四出版了《梅科姆论坛报》，在黑人消息栏里登载了一篇简短的讣告，还有一篇社论。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maycomb was interested by the news of Tom's death for perhaps two days; two days was enough for the information to spread through the county. "Did you hear about?… No? Well, they say he was runnin' fit to beat lightnin'…" To Maycomb, Tom's death was typical. Typical of a nigger to cut and run. Typical of a nigger's mentality to have no plan, no thought for the future, just run blind first chance he saw. Funny thing, Atticus Finch might've got him off scot free, but wait --? Hell no. You know how they are. Easy come, easy go. Just shows you, that Robinson boy was legally married, they say he kept himself clean, went to church and all that, but when it comes down to the line the veneer's mighty thin. Nigger always comes out in 'em.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆之死，在大约两天内是梅科姆镇的谈话资料。两天就足够让这个消息传遍全县。“你听说了吗？……还没有？哦，他们说，他跑得比闪电还快……”对梅科姆来说，汤姆之死具有典型意义。汤姆是一个迅速逃跑的黑人典型，典型地表现了一个黑人的特点，没有打算，不顾后果，一有机会就盲目地逃跑。遗憾的是，阿迪克斯·芬奇本来有可能设法使他无罪获释，不过，要他等待？哼，他才不会呢。他们黑人，你还不知道吗？什么事情都不假思索。随随便便。这只不过表明，鲁宾逊虽然是正式结的婚，并能洁身自好，经常做礼拜；但是，说到底，这些都足表面现像。黑人的特性总是会暴露出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How could this be so, I wondered, as I read Mr. Underwood's editorial. Senseless killing -- Tom had been given due process of law to the day of his death; he had been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had fought for him all the way. Then Mr. Underwood's meaning became clear: Atticus had used every tool available to free men to save Tom Robinson, but in the secret courts of men's hearts Atticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一边读着安德伍德先生的社论，一边想。毫无意义的残杀？怎么能这样说呢？汤姆的案件直到他被枪杀为止都是按正当的法律程序处理的；审判是在法庭公开进行的，罪是十二个正直的人组成的陪审团判定的，我父亲还自始至终为争取他的释放作出了努力。想着想着，我恍然大悟，懂得了安德伍德先生的意思：尽管阿迪克斯想尽了自由人可以采用的一切办法搭救汤姆·鲁宾逊，但是，在人们心中的秘密法庭里，阿迪克斯则无话可辩。汤姆在梅耶拉·尤厄尔张嘴呼喊那一刹那就已经注定要被处死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. B. B. Underwood was at his most bitter, and he couldn't have cared less who canceled advertising and subscriptions. (But Maycomb didn't play that way: Mr. Underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to, he'd still get his advertising and subscriptions. If he wanted to make a fool of himself in his paper that was his business.) Mr. Underwood didn't talk about miscarriages of justice, he was writing so children could understand. Mr. Underwood simply figured it was a sin to kill cripples, be they standing, sitting, or escaping. He likened Tom's death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children, and Maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted in The Montgomery Advertiser.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安德伍德先生悲痛欲绝，不下于谁取消了广告，撤销了订阅。（不过，梅科姆并没有谁那么做，尽管安德伍德先生！喊到浑身出汗，尽管他想写什么就写什么，刊登广告、订阅报纸的人仍然有那么多。如果你想在报纸上嘲弄自已，那是他自己的事。）安德伍德先生只字未提什么审判不公平，他只是写得让孩子们都能懂得这件事。他只说，一个残废人，不管是站着、坐着还是企图逃跑，杀害他就是罪恶。他把汤姆的死比喻为猎人和小孩毫无意义的残杀唱歌的鸟。梅科姆人认为，他是想把社论写得富有诗意，希望连《蒙哥马利广告报》都能转载。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The name Ewell gave me a queasy feeling. Maycomb had lost no time in getting Mr. Ewell's views on Tom's demise and passing them along through that English Channel of gossip, Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Stephanie told Aunt Alexandra in Jem's presence ("Oh foot, he's old enough to listen.") that Mr. Ewell said it made one down and about two more to go. Jem told me not to be afraid, Mr. Ewell was more hot gas than anything. Jem also told me that if I breathed a word to Atticus, if in any way I let Atticus know I knew, Jem would personally never speak to me again.</div>
