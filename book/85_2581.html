<div class="line_en">Eddie felt his feet touch ground. The sky was changing again, from cobalt blue to charcoal gray, and Eddie was surrounded now by fallen trees and blackened rubble. He grabbed his arms, shoulders, thighs, and calves. He felt stronger than before, but when he tried to touch his toes, he could no longer do so. The limberness was gone. No more childish rubbery sensation. Every muscle he had was as tight as piano wire.</div>

<div class="line_en">He ran differently now, in the hard measured steps of a soldier. He heard thunder -- or something like thunder, explosions, or bomb blasts -- and he instinctively fell to the ground, landed on his stomach, and pulled himself along by his forearms. The sky burst open and gushed rain, a thick, brownish downpour. Eddie lowered his head and crawled along in the mud, spitting away the dirty water that gathered around his lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次，他跑的姿势不同，是一个士兵的坚实稳固的脚步。他听到了雷声——或者近似打雷、爆炸、炮击一样的声音——他下意识地趴下，俯卧在地上，匍匐前进。天空爆裂开来，污浊的雨水倾盆而下。爱迪低着头，在泥泞里爬行着，不时地把积在嘴唇上的脏水啐掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Young Men go to war. Sometimes because they have to, sometimes because they want to. Always, they feel they are supposed to. This comes from the sad, layered stories of life, which over the centuries have seen courage confused with picking up arms, and cowardice confused with laying them down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻人上战场，有时是因为他们不得不去，有时是因为他们想去。但是，他们永远觉得，他们应该去。千百年悲哀的、错综复杂的人类历史让人们误认为拿起武器便是勇敢，放下武器便是怯懦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally he felt his head brush against something solid. He looked up to see a rifle dug into the ground, with a helmet sitting atop it and a set of dog tags hanging from the grip. Blinking through the rain, he fingered the dog tags, then scrambled backward wildly into a porous wall of stringy vines that hung from a massive banyan tree. He dove into their darkness. He pulled his knees into a crouch. He tried to catch his breath. Fear had found him, even in heaven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，他感到自己的头碰到了一个硬实的东西。他抬起头来，看到一杆长枪插在地里，上面扣着一个钢盔，枪把上挂着一串士兵身份牌。他在雨水中眨眨眼睛，拿起那串士兵身份牌，立即惊慌失措地倒退着爬进了从一棵巨大的榕树上垂下的茂密的藤蔓中。他躲进藤蔓的黑暗中。他弓起膝盖蹲好。他努力让自己镇定下来。即使在天堂，恐惧也不放过他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since he'd never fired an actual rifle, Eddie began to practice at the shooting arcade at Ruby Pier. You paid a nickel and the machine hummed and you squeezed the trigger and fired metal slugs at pictures of jungle animals, a lion or a giraffe. Eddie went every evening, after running the brake levers at the Li'l Folks Miniature Railway. Ruby Pier had added a number of new, smaller attractions, because roller coasters, after the Depression, had become too expensive. The Miniature Railway was pretty much just that, the train cars no higher than a grown man's thigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪从来没有放过真枪，所以，他开始在“红宝石码头”的射击室里练习。你付五分钱，机器嗡嗡响起来，你扣动扳机，用金属弹丸射击画片上的丛林动物，比如，一头狮子或一只长颈鹿。每天晚上，在“李氏迷你小火车”处扳完刹车杆之后，他就来这里。“红宝石码头”增加了几个新的小型游乐设施，因为在大萧条之后，疯狂过山车已经变得太贵了。“李氏迷你小火车”正如它的名字一样，还不及一个成人的腿高。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie, before enlisting, had been working to save money to study engineering. That was his goal -- he wanted to build things, even if his brother, Joe, kept saying, "C'mon, Eddie, you aren't smart enough for that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在报名参军之前，爱迪一直在干活攒钱，想去学工程学。那是他的理想——他想造东西，虽然他哥哥乔总是说，“得了吧，爱迪，你可没聪明到那个地步。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But once the war started, pier business dropped. Most of Eddie's customers now were women alone with children, their fathers gone to fight. Sometimes the children asked Eddie to lift them over his head, and when Eddie complied, he saw the mothers' sad smiles: He guessed it was the right lift but the wrong pair of arms. Soon, Eddie figured, he would join those distant men, and his life of greasing tracks and running brake levers would be over. War was his call to manhood. Maybe someone would miss him, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，战争一开始，码头的生意就差了。现在，爱迪的大部分客人是带着孩子的妇女，父亲们去打仗了。有时候，孩子们让爱迪把他们举到头顶上，当爱迪这样做的时候，他会看到母亲们忧伤的笑容：他猜想，举是举得没错，但应该是用另一双手臂。不久，爱迪寻思，他应该加入远离家乡的男人队伍，这样他的润滑轨道和扳刹车杆的生活也将就此告终。战争是对他男子气概的召唤。或许，有人还会想念他。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was older than the men in Eddie's troop, a lifetime military man with a lanky swagger and a prominent chin that gave him a resemblance to a movie actor of the day. Most of the soldiers liked him well enough, although he had a short temper and a habit of yelling inches from your face, so you could see his teeth, already yellowed from tobacco. Still, the Captain always promised he would "leave no one behind," no matter what happened, and the men took comfort in that.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, Eddie stopped praying. He stopped counting days. He and the Captain spoke only of escaping before they all met the same fate. The Captain figured the enemy war effort was desperate, that was why they needed every half-dead prisoner to scrape coal. Each day in the mine there were fewer and fewer bodies. At night, Eddie heard bombing; it seemed to be getting closer. If things got too bad, the Captain figured, their captors would bail out, destroy everything. He had seen ditches dug beyond the prisoner barracks and large oil barrels positioned up the steep hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那以后，爱迪不再祈祷。他不再数日子。他和上尉只谈论逃跑的事，他们不想遭到同样的下场。上尉估计，敌人正在孤注一掷，这就是为什么他们需要每一个半死不活的俘虏来挖煤。矿井里挖煤的人数日渐减少。晚上，爱迪听到炮弹的轰炸声，声音似乎越来越靠近了。上尉估计，如果形势再恶化下去的话，敌人可能就要撤了，他们会销毁一切。他看到了俘虏营外挖出的深沟和陡峭的山坡上竖着的大油桶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Crazy Two kicked black dirt over the body, then glared at Eddie and spat at his feet. He yelled something at Crazy Three and Crazy Four, both of whom seemed as stunned as the prisoners. For a moment, Crazy Three shook his head and mumbled, as if saying a prayer, his eyelids lowered and his lips moving furiously. But Crazy Two waved the gun and yelled again and Crazy Three and Crazy Four slowly lifted Rabozzo's body by its feet and dragged it along the mine floor, leaving a trail of wet blood, which, in the darkness, looked like spilt oil. They dropped him against a wall, next to a pickax.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="三个星期之后，一个月色朦胧的夜晚，三号疯子在俘虏营里站岗。因为闷得慌，他拿着两块砖头大小的石头在耍着玩。石头不断地掉在地上，他又捡起来，高高地抛到空中，然后再掉到地上。满身煤灰的爱迪抬起头来，石头咚咚落地的声音使他恼火。他正想睡觉。但是这会儿，他慢慢地坐起身来。他的视线清晰了。他感到他的神经活跃起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Eddie was already yelling at the guard, "Hey! Yo! You're doing it wrong!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那些石头，”爱迪朝看守的方向点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Crazy Three looked at him cautiously. Of all the guards, Eddie felt, he had his best chance with this one. Crazy Three had occasionally sneaked the prisoners pieces of bread and tossed them through the small hut hole that served as a window. Eddie made the circular motion again and smiled. Crazy Three approached, stopped, went back for his bayonet, then walked the two rocks over to Eddie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三号疯子警惕地望着他。爱迪觉得，在所有的看守中，这个可能最好对付。三号疯子偶尔会偷偷地拿一些面包给俘虏，他会把面包从竹棚上那个当窗户用的小洞里扔进来。爱迪又做了一次环形动作，笑了笑。三号疯子朝他走过来，停下脚步，回头拿起他的刺刀枪，然后，走过来把石头交给了爱迪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Like this," Eddie said, and he began to juggle effortlessly. He had learned when he was seven years old, from an Italian sideshow man who juggled six plates at once. Eddie had spent countless hours practicing on the boardwalk -- pebbles, rubber balls, whatever he could find. It was no big deal. Most pier kids could juggle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“像这样，”爱迪说道，然后，开始轻松自如地耍起石头来。这一招他是在七岁那年，跟杂耍团里一个一次能耍六个盘子的意大利人学来的。他曾经在海滨走道上花了无数个小时来练习——卵石、胶皮球，他用任何他能找到的东西来练习。这不是什么了不起的事。码头上大部分孩子都会杂耍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Three rocks, see?" Eddie held up three fingers. "Three."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“三块石头，明白吗？”爱迪竖起三个手指。“三。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Crazy Three opened the bamboo door and did what Eddie'd hoped he would do: He yelled for the others. Crazy One appeared with a fat rock and Crazy Two followed him in. Crazy Three thrust the rock at Eddie and yelled something. Then he stepped back, grinned at the others, and motioned for them to sit, as if to say, "Watch this."</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie tossed the rocks into a rhythmic weave. Each one was as big as his palm. He sang a carnival tune. "Da, da-da-da daaaaa…" The guards laughed. Eddie laughed. The Captain laughed. Forced laughter, buying time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪抛着石头，有板有眼地耍着花样。每块石头都有巴掌大小。他唱起了狂欢节的调子。“嗒，嗒，嗒…”看守们大笑起来。爱迪笑了。上尉也笑啦。强装欢笑，为了争取时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get closer," Eddie sang, pretending the words were part of the melody. Morton and Smitty slid gently in, feigning interest.</div>

<div class="line_en">The guards were enjoying the diversion. Their posture slackened. Eddie tried to swallow his breathing. Just a little longer. He threw one rock high into the air, then juggled the lower two, then caught the third, then did it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看守们饶有兴味地观看着。他们的身体松弛下来。爱迪屏住呼吸。再等一会儿。他将一块石头高高地抛到空中，耍弄着下面的两块，然后，他接住第三块，再来一个循环。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Crazy Two frowned suspiciously, but Eddie smiled the way the jugglers back at Ruby Pier smiled when they were losing the audience. "Lookie here, lookie here, lookie here!" Eddie cooed. "Greatest show on earth, buddy boy!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now!" Eddie yelled. In mid-juggle he grabbed a rock and, like the good baseball pitcher he had always been, whipped it hard into the face of Crazy Two, breaking his nose. Eddie caught the second rock and threw it, left-handed, square into the chin of Crazy One, who fell back as the Captain jumped him, grabbing his bayonet. Crazy Three, momentarily frozen, reached for his pistol and fired wildly as Morton and Smitty tackled his legs. The door burst open and Crazy Four ran in, and Eddie threw the last rock at him and missed his head by inches, but as he ducked, the Captain was waiting against the wall with the bayonet, which he drove through Crazy Four's rib cage so hard the two of them tumbled through the door. Eddie, powered by adrenaline, leaped on Crazy Two and pounded his face harder than he had ever pounded anyone back on Pitkin Avenue. He grabbed a loose rock and slammed it against his skull, again and again, until he looked at his hands and saw a hideous purplish goo that he realized was blood and skin and coal ash, mixed together -- then he heard a gunshot and grabbed his head, smearing the goo on his temples. He looked up and saw Smitty standing over him, holding an enemy pistol. Crazy Two's body went slack. He was bleeding from the chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“动手！”爱迪大喊一声。他接住一块石头，然后，拿出他那优秀棒球投球手的架势，将石头朝二号疯子的脸上狠狠砸去，打断了他的鼻梁。爱迪接住第二块石头，用左手将石头正正地砸在一号疯子的下巴颏上，一号疯子向后倒去，上尉扑到他身上，夺过他的刺刀枪。三号疯子愣了愣神，伸手掏出他的手枪，胡乱扫射起来，莫顿和史密迪抱住了他的大腿。门被撞开了，四号疯子闯了进来，爱迪将最后一块石头朝他扔去，石头从他脑边擦过，没有击中，但是，上尉此刻正手持刺刀候在墙边，在他弯身躲石头的时候，上尉将刺刀一下子插进了他的肋骨架里，冲力之猛，使得两人一起栽到了门外。爱迪在肾上腺素的刺激下，跳到二号疯子的身上，用拳头朝他的脸上猛砸起来，在皮肯大街的时候，他也没有这么狠地揍过人。他抓起一块石头，朝二号疯子的脑壳上狠狠地砸过去，一下又一下，直到他看了看自己的手，发现手上有一种令人恶心的淡紫色黏液，他意识到，那淡紫色黏液原来是血、皮肤和煤灰的混合物——然后，他听到一声枪响，赶紧抱住脑袋，手上的黏液抹到了他的太阳穴上。他抬起头，见史密迪正站在他身边，手上握着敌人的手枪。二号疯子的身体瘫软下去，胸口流着血。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Prisoners, Thin and barefoot and covered in blood, were running now for the steep hill. Eddie had expected gunfire, more guards to fight, but there was no one. The other huts were empty. In fact, the entire camp was empty. Eddie wondered how long it had been just the four Crazies and them.</div>
