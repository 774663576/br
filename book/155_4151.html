<div class="line_en">Mr. Tate had dressed for the occasion. He wore an ordinary business suit, which made him look somehow like every other man: gone were his high boots, lumber jacket, and bullet-studded belt. From that moment he ceased to terrify me. He was sitting forward in the witness chair, his hands clasped between his knees, listening attentively to the circuit solicitor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The solicitor, a Mr. Gilmer, was not well known to us. He was from Abbottsville; we saw him only when court convened, and that rarely, for court was of no special interest to Jem and me. A balding, smooth-faced man, he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty. Although his back was to us, we knew he had a slight cast in one of his eyes which he used to his advantage: he seemed to be looking at a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was hell on juries and witnesses. The jury, thinking themselves under close scrutiny, paid attention; so did the witnesses, thinking likewise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巡回法务官，一个叫吉尔默先生的人，我们都不太熟悉。他是阿波兹维尔人，只有在法院开庭时才能看见他，就是这种情况也不多，因为法院对我和杰姆并不具有特别的吸引力。这位吉尔默先生正在秃顶，光光的脸上没一根胡须，年纪在四十到六十之间。虽然我们坐在他的背面，也知道他一只眼睛有点斜视，这点他利用得很好：他会看起来在注视着某个人，而实际上根本不是那么一回事，因而他对陪审团成员和证人来说，都是十分可怕的。陪审团以为自己总是在受着严密的监视，不敢大意，旁证人也同样有这种想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Negroes behind us whispered softly among themselves; Dill was asking Reverend Sykes what it was all about, but Reverend Sykes said he didn't know. So far, things were utterly dull: nobody had thundered, there were no arguments between opposing counsel, there was no drama; a grave disappointment to all present, it seemed. Atticus was proceeding amiably, as if he were involved in a title dispute. With his infinite capacity for calming turbulent seas, he could make a rape case as dry as a sermon. Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells, of sleepy-eyed sullen men, of a husky voice calling in the night, "Mr. Finch? They gone?" Our nightmare had gone with daylight, everything would come out all right.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maycomb's Ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a Negro cabin. The cabin's plank walls were supplemented with sheets of corrugated iron, its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat, so only its general shape suggested its original design: square, with four tiny rooms opening onto a shotgun hall, the cabin rested uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone. Its windows were merely open spaces in the walls, which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips of cheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on Maycomb's refuse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅科姆镇上尤厄尔家的人住在垃圾堆后一个小屋里，从前那里边住的是黑人。这小屋的木板墙上又钉上了波纹铁片，顶上加盖了锤平了的锡罐头皮，只能从整个轮廓看出原来设计的模样：方方正正，四间很小的房间通向一个狭长的厅堂，整个屋子歪斜在四块形状不规则的石灰石上。墙上的空洞就是窗子，到夏天得用一块包干酪的布遮上，以防御那些在梅科姆垃圾堆上大吃大喝的害虫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning every day, and the fruits of their industry (those that were not eaten) made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child: what passed for a fence was bits of tree-limbs, broomsticks and tool shafts, all tipped with rusty hammer-heads, snaggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes and grubbing hoes, held on with pieces of barbed wire. Enclosed by this barricade was a dirty yard containing the remains of a Model-T Ford (on blocks), a discarded dentist's chair, an ancient icebox, plus lesser items: old shoes, worn-out table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, under which scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully.</div>

Some people said six, others said nine; there were always several dirty-faced ones at the windows when anyone passed by.

<div class="line_en">Atticus took us with him last Christmas when he complied with the mayor's request. A dirt road ran from the highway past the dump, down to a small Negro settlement some five hundred yards beyond the Ewells'. It was necessary either to back out to the highway or go the full length of the road and turn around; most people turned around in the Negroes' front yards. In the frosty December dusk, their cabins looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and doorways glowing amber from the fires inside. There were delicious smells about: chicken, bacon frying crisp as the twilight air. Jem and I detected squirrel cooking, but it took an old countryman like Atticus to identify possum and rabbit, aromas that vanished when we rode back past the Ewell residence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Gilmer's back stiffened a little, and I felt sorry for him. Perhaps I'd better explain something now. I've heard that lawyers' children, on seeing their parents in court in the heat of argument, get the wrong idea: they think opposing counsel to be the personal enemies of their parents, they suffer agonies, and are surprised to see them often go out arm-in-arm with their tormenters during the first recess. This was not true of Jem and me. We acquired no traumas from watching our father win or lose. I'm sorry that I can't provide any drama in this respect; if I did, it would not be true. We could tell, however, when debate became more acrimonious than professional, but this was from watching lawyers other than our father. I never heard Atticus raise his voice in my life, except to a deaf witness. Mr. Gilmer was doing his job, as Atticus was doing his. Besides, Mr. Ewell was Mr. Gilmer's witness, and he had no business being rude to him of all people.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was becoming nervous. Atticus seemed to know what he was doing -- but it seemed to me that he'd gone frog-sticking without a light. Never, never, never, on cross-examination ask a witness a question you don't already know the answer to, was a tenet I absorbed with my baby-food.

<div class="line_en">Atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat. He drew out an envelope, then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen. He moved leisurely, and had turned so that he was in full view of the jury. He unscrewed the fountain-pen cap and placed it gently on his table. He shook the pen a little, then handed it with the envelope to the witness. "Would you write your name for us?" he asked. "Clearly now, so the jury can see you do it."</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't think so: Atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that Mr. Ewell could have beaten up Mayella. That much I could follow. If her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to show that a left-handed person did it. Sherlock Holmes and Jem Finch would agree. But Tom Robinson could easily be left-handed, too. Like Mr. Heck Tate, I imagined a person facing me, went through a swift mental pantomime, and concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with his left. I looked down at him. His back was to us, but I could see his broad shoulders and bull-thick neck. He could easily have done it. I thought Jem was counting his chickens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不这么看。据我看，阿迪克斯似乎想要使人们知道，梅耶拉可能是被尤厄尔先生打的。这一点我是理解的。如果她的右眼被打青了，而且她被打伤的部位主要是她的右脸，就可以证明她是被一个左撇子打的。舍洛克·福尔摩斯圆和杰姆·芬奇都会同意这种说法。但是，汤姆·鲁宾逊也同样可能是个左撇子。像赫克·塔特先生一样，我也想像出一个人正面对着我，头脑中迅速地演了一幕哑剧，然后得出一个这样的结论：汤姆很可能用右手抓住梅耶拉，用左手去打。我往下看着汤姆。他背对着我们，不过，我仍然能看到他宽阔的肩膀和粗大的脖子。他要那样做的话，是很容易的。我想杰姆高兴得太早了。">查看中文翻译</div>
