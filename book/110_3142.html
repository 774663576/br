<div class="line_en">When I heard from Arthur the terrible news of Lucy's strange illness, I went to her immediately. I could see that she was very ill. She lay in bed all day and did not move. She was as white as a ghost and she was very thin. When night came, she was afraid to sleep, and in the morning, on her neck there were two strange little wounds.</div>

He brought some flowers with a very strong smell, and he put a circle of them round Lucy's neck. "My dear," he said, "these are garlic flowers. Do not take them from your neck tonight, and do not open your window."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="范赫尔辛做得很对。有了阿瑟的血，露西马上开始好转了。但离开之前，范赫尔辛又做了一件事。他拿了一些味道很重的花，编成花环戴在露西的脖子上。“亲爱的，”他说，“这是大蒜花。今晚不要把它们从脖子上摘下来，也不要开窗户。”">查看中文翻译</div>
