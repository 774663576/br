<div class="line_en">So they're gone, she thought, sighing with relief and disappointment. Her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her, like a bramble sprung across her face. She felt curiously divided, as if one part of her were drawn out there -- it was a still day, hazy; the Lighthouse looked this morning at an immense distance; the other had fixed itself doggedly, solidly, here on the lawn. She saw her canvas as if it had floated up and placed itself white and uncompromising directly before her. It seemed to rebuke her with its cold stare for all this hurry and agitation; this folly and waste of emotion; it drastically recalled her and spread through her mind first a peace, as her disorderly sensations (he had gone and she had been so sorry for him and she had said nothing) trooped off the field; and then, emptiness. She looked blankly at the canvas, with its uncompromising white stare; from the canvas to the garden. There was something (she stood screwing up her little Chinese eyes in her small puckered face), something she remembered in the relations of those lines cutting across, slicing down, and in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and browns, which had stayed in her mind; which had tied a knot in her mind so that at odds and ends of time, involuntarily, as she walked along the Brompton Road, as she brushed her hair, she found herself painting that picture, passing her eye over it, and untying the knot in imagination. But there was all the difference in the world between this planning airily away from the canvas and actually taking her brush and making the first mark.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at Mr Ramsay's presence, and her easel, rammed into the earth so nervously, was at the wrong angle. And now that she had ut that right, and in so doing had subdued the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made her remember how she was such and such a person, had such and such relations to people, she took her hand and raised her brush. For a moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the air. Where to begin?-- that was the question at what point to make the first mark? One line placed on the canvas committed her to innumerable risks, to frequent and irrevocable decisions. All that in idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex; as the waves shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top, but to the swimmer among them are divided by steep gulfs, and foaming crests. Still the risk must be run; the mark made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆齐先生在的时候，由于慌乱她拿错了一枝画笔，紧张之中把画架插进地里，角度也不对。现在她已经纠正过来了，在纠正的过程中她抑制下了不恰当的不相干的思绪，它们引得她注意力分散、使她记起自己怎样是如此这般的一个人，和别人有着如此这般的关系。她抬手举起画笔。在痛苦但激动的如痴如迷的状态中，画笔颤抖着在空中停留了片刻。从哪儿开始呢？——这是问题之所在；在哪儿落下第一笔？在画布上画下了一根线条就意味着要承担无数的风险，经常要做出无法更改的决定。所有在头脑里显得简单的事到了实践中立刻变得复杂起来；就如从悬崖顶上看，波浪形状匀整对称，但对于在波浪中游泳的人，浪和浪之间却被险恶的游涡和翻腾着白沫的浪峰隔开。尽管如此，险是非冒不可的；第一笔终于画了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a curious physical sensation, as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back, she made her first quick decisive stroke. The brush descended. It flickered brown over the white canvas; it left a running mark. A second time she did it -- a third time. And so pausing and so flickering, she attained a dancing rhythmical movement, as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another, and all were related; and so, lightly and swiftly pausing, striking, she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed ( she felt it looming out at her) a space. Down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her. For what could be more formidable than that space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers -- this other thing, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of apperarances and commanded reluctant. Why always be drawn out and haled away? Why not left in peace, to talk to Mr Carmichael on the lawn? It was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow. Other worshipful objects were content with worship; men, women, God, all let one kneel prostrate; but this form, were it only the shape of a white lamp-shade looming on a wicker table, roused one to perpetual combat, challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted. Always (it was in her nature, or in her sex, she did not know which) before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul, a soul reft of body, hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt. Why then did she do it? She looked at the canvas, lightly scored with running lines. It would be hung in the servants' bedrooms. It would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa. What was the good of doing it then, and she heard some voice saying she couldn't paint, saying she couldn't create, as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind, so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是带着一种仿佛既被鞭策向前同时又必须抑制自己的奇特的肉体上的感觉画下迅速的、决定性的第一笔的。画笔落了下来。它在白色的画布上轻轻抹上了一片道棕色；留下了一片连续的色痕。她又画了一笔——再画了一笔？就这样停上片刻，轻轻画上一笔，她的动作具有了舞蹈般的节奏，仿佛停顿是节奏的一个部分，一笔一笔是节奏的另一部分，一切都是相互联系的；她就这样轻快而迅速地停停画画，在画布上画下了一些连起来的、显得怯生生的棕色线条，它们刚一落到画面上就围起了一片空间（她感到它赫然显现在她面前）。在一个浪谷里她看见下一个波浪越来越高地向她涌来。有什么能比那个空间更令人生畏的呢？现在她又处于这种情况之中了，她想，一面退后一步观察画面，被拉出了与人们的交往、闲谈、生活的圈子，推到她这个难对付的宿敌面前——这个不同的东西，这个真理、这个现实，突然抓住了她，在表面现象的背后赤裸裸地出现，完全支配了她的注意力。她挺不愿意、挺勉强。为什么总要被硬拉出来拽走？为什么不能不受干扰地在草坪上和卡迈克尔先生聊天？这总还是一种严格的交流方式；其他崇拜的对象都满足于受崇拜；男人、女人、上帝，都让你跪拜在地；但是这种严格的交流方式，哪怕只是关于在柳条桌上显现的白色灯罩的形状，都会激起她投入永恒的论争，鞭策她去进行一场注定会被击败的战斗。每次都是这样（她也不知道是出于她的天性还是因为她是女人），在她把流动性件的生活结晶成绘画之前，她总有片刻时间感到处于裸露无防的状态，像个尚未出世的灵魂，一个被剥夺了躯体的灵魂，在某个向风的极顶上犹豫，毫无保护地暴露着，遭受一切疑虑的狂风的吹袭。那么她为什么还要这样去做呢？她看着轻轻画上了连续的线条的画布。它可能会被挂在仆人的卧室里。它可能会被卷起来塞在沙发下面。那么画它还有什么用处呢，而这时她听到了一个声音，说她不会画画，说她没有创造性，她仿佛被卷进了一股习惯的潮流之中，经过了一段时间以后在脑子里变成了经验，结果是你重复着一些话而不再意识到这些话最初是什么人说的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Can't paint, can't write, she murmured monotonously, anxiously considering what her plan of attack should be. For the mass loomed before her; it protruded; she felt it pressing on her eyeballs. Then, as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her faculties were spontaneously squirted, she began precariously dipping among the blues and umbers, moving her brush hither and thither, but it was now heavier and went slower, as if it had fallen in with some rhythm which was dictated to her (she kept looking at the hedge, at the canvas) by what she rhythm was strong enough to bear her along with it on its current. Certainly she was losing consciousness of outer things. And as she lost consciousness of outer things, and her name and her personality and her appearance, and whether Mr Carmichael was there or not, her mind kept throwing up from its depths, scenes, and names, and sayings, and memories and ideas, like a fountain spurting over that glaring, hideously difficult white space, while she modelled it with greens and blues.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charles Tansley used to say that, she remembered, women can't paint, can't write. Coming up behind her, he had stood close beside her, a thing she hated, as she painted her on this very spot. "Shag tobacco," he said, "fivepence an ounce," parading his poverty, his principles. (But the war had drawn the sting of her femininity. Poor devils, one thought, poor devils, of both sexes.) He was always carrying a book about under his arm -- a purple book. He "worked." He sat, she remembered, working in a blaze of sun. At dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view. But after all, she reflected, there was the scene on the beach. One must remember that. It was a windy morning. They had all gone down to the beach. Mrs Ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock. She wrote and wrote. "Oh," she said, looking up at something floating in the sea, "is it a lobster pot? Is it an upturned boat?" She was so short-sighted that she could not see, and then Charles Tansley became as nice as he could possibly be. He began playing ducks and drakes. They chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping over the waves. Every now and then Mrs Ramsay looked up over her spectacles and laughed at them. What they said she could not remember, but only she and Charles throwing stones and getting on very well all of a sudden and Mrs Ramsay watching them. She was highly conscious of that. Mrs Ramsay, she thought, stepping back and screwing up her eyes. (It must have altered the design a good deal when she was sitting on the step with James. There must have been a shadow.) When she thought of herself and Charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach, it seemed to depend somehow upon Mrs Ramsay sitting under the rock, with a pad on her knee, writing letters. (She wrote innumerable letters, and sometimes the wind took them and she and Charles just saved a page from the sea.) But what a power was in the human soul! she thought. That woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything into simplicity; made these angers, irritations fall off like old rags; she brought together this and that and then this, and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite (she and Charles squabbling, sparring, had been silly and spiteful) something -- this scene on the beach for example, this moment of friendship and liking -- which survived, after all these years complete, so that she dipped into it to re-fashion her memory of him, and there it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查尔斯·坦斯利过去老爱这样说，她想起来了，女人不会画画，不会写作。当她就在这个地方作画时，他会从她背后走上来，紧挨着站在她旁边，这是她最讨厌的事。“粗质板烟丝，”他说，“五个便士一盎司”。标榜自己的贫穷和原则，（但是战争使她失去了女性的尖刻。可怜的家伙们，她想，可怜的男女们，卷进了这样的混乱局面。）他走到哪儿都在胳膊底下夹本书——一本紫皮的书。他在“工作”。他坐在那儿，她记得，在强烈的阳光下工作。晚餐时他会坐在她视野的正当中。可是，她想道，毕竟有过海滩上的那一幕。这情景应该记住。那是一个刮着风的上午。大家都到海滩上去了。拉姆齐夫人坐在一块岩石旁写信 她写了又写。“啊，”她终于抬起头来看着漂在海里的什么东西，说道，“那是只捕龙虾用的篓子吗？还是一条翻了的小船？”她眼睛非常近视，所以看不清楚，这时查尔斯·坦斯利变得别提多好了。他开始打水漂儿玩。他们挑扁平的小黑石头扔出去，使它们飞掠过水面。拉姆齐夫人时不时地抬起眼睛从眼镜上方看过来，取笑他们。他们说了些什么她已经记不得了，只记得她和查尔斯扔石头，突然相处得非常好，而拉姆齐夫人则看着他们。她非常清楚地意识到这一点。拉姆齐夫人，她想道，往后退了一步，使劲眯起了眼睛。（当她和詹姆斯一起坐在台阶上的时候，一定极大地改变了她的构想。一定会有影子的。）拉姆齐夫人。当她想到自己和查尔斯打水漂以及海滩上的整个情景，不知怎的感到一切都取决于拉姆齐夫人坐在那块岩石下，膝头放着一本拍纸簿在写信。（她写了无数的信，有时候信被风刮跑了，她和查尔斯只抓回来一页，没给吹到海里去。）但是人的灵魂里有着多么巨大的力量！她想。那个坐在那边一块岩石下写信的女人使一切事物化为单纯；使这些怒气和烦躁像破衣烂衫般落到地上；她把这个那个放到一起，从愚蠢无聊和怨恨恼怒中（她和查尔斯互相争吵攻击，愚蠢无聊，相互怨恨）制造出某种东西——例如海滩上的一幕，这充满友谊和好感的片刻——在这么多年之后仍完好无损地保存着，她只要稍加回忆，对坦斯利的记忆就会重现心头，它几乎像一件艺术品留在她的心中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Like a work of art," she repeated, looking from her canvas to the drawing-room steps and back again. She must rest for a moment. And, resting, looking from one to the other vaguely, the old question which traversed the sky of the soul perpetually, the vast, the general question which was apt to particularise itself at such moments as these, when she released faculties that had been on the strain, stood over her, paused over her, darkened over her. What is the meaning of life? That was all -- a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one. This, that, and the other; herself and Charles Tansley and the breaking wave; Mrs Ramsay bringing them together; Mrs Ramsay saying, "Life stand still here"; Mrs Ramsay making of the moment something permanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent)-- this was of the nature of a revelation. In the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal passing and flowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking) was struck into stability. Life stand still here, Mrs Ramsay said. "Mrs Ramsay! Mrs Ramsay!" she repeated. She owed it all to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“像一件艺术品，”她重复道，眼睛看看画布，看看客厅的台阶，然后又回到画布上。她一定得休息一会儿了。她一面休息，一面茫无表情地在画布和台阶间移动着视线，而那个永远在她心灵的天空中盘桓的老问题，那个巨大的、一般性的问题在现在这样的情况下，在她把绷紧的感官放松下来以后、很容易变得具体，在她的上空停留下来，笼罩着她。生命的意义是什么？如此而已——一个十分简单的问题；一个随着年华的消逝会向你越逼越近的问题。那伟大的启示从来没有出现。也许那伟大的启示永远也不会出现。出现的是日常生活中小小的奇迹、启发、仿佛在黑暗中意外地擦亮了的火柴；眼前就是这样。这样、那样、等等的事物；她自己和查尔斯·坦期利和冲击海岸的浪花；拉姆齐夫人把他们联系在了一起；拉姆齐夫人说“生命在这里凝固了”；拉姆齐夫人将那一刻变成了永恒（正如在另一个领域里莉莉自己也试图将那一刻变成永恒）——这件事具有启示的性质。在混乱之中有了形态；外部世界的飘移和流动（她看着飘过的云彩和颤动的树叶）被固定了下来。生命在这里凝固了，拉姆齐夫人说。“拉姆齐夫人！拉姆齐夫人！”她不断喊道。莉莉得到这个启示，应归功于拉姆齐夫人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All was silence. Nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house. She looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows green and blue with the reflected leaves. The faint thought she was thinking of Mrs Ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house; this smoke; this fine early morning air. Faint and unreal, it was amazingly pure and exciting. She hoped nobody would open the window or come out of the house, but that she might be left alone to go on thinking, to go on painting. She turned to her canvas. But impelled by some curiosity, driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged, she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether, down there on the beach, she could see that little company setting sail. Down there among the little boats which floated, some with their sails furled, some slowly, for it was very calm moving away, there was one rather apart from the others. The sail was even now being hoisted. She decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little boat Mr Ramsay was sitting with Cam and James. Now they had got the sail up; now after a little flagging and silence, she watched the boat take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea.</div>
