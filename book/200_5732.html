<div class="line_en">It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it; it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩开始慷慨激昂地大声数落玛丽埃塔艾克莫，哈利觉得罗恩这么做真是在帮自己的忙；他只要摆出生气的样子，趁罗恩换口气的时候点点头，说声“是”或者“没错”就行了，他可以一门心思地仔细想一想在冥想盆里看到的那些事情，尽管越想越难过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character. Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry's head… he was as bad, wasn't he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it… not unless they really loathed them… perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他觉得冥想盆里的那些记忆好像正在啮噬自己的内心。他一直深信自己的父母都是很出色的人。关于爸爸的性格，他向来一点也不相信斯内普抛出的那些中伤、诽谤。像海格和小天狼星这些人不是告诉过哈利，他的爸爸有多出色吗？（是啊，嗯，看看小天狼星自己像什么样吧，一个挑剔的声音在哈利脑袋里说…他一样坏，不是吗？）是的，他以前无意中听麦格教授说起过，他爸爸和小天狼星是学校里最能惹麻烦的人，她把他们描述成韦斯莱双胞胎的先驱者，可哈利无法想象弗雷德和乔治会为了寻开心，把什么人头朝下倒挂起来…除非他们俩非常讨厌这个人…也许是马尔福，要么就是那些罪有应得的人…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利一直提醒自己，莉莉干预了这件事，他的妈妈很正直。但是，他记得莉莉对詹姆大喊大叫时脸上的那种表情，这和其他的事一样让他心烦意乱；很显然，莉莉讨厌詹姆，哈利实在不明白他们后来怎么会结婚。有几次，他甚至怀疑詹姆是不是强迫她…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside. And now… now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.</div>

And hadn't James replied, "It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean." Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius… but in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen…</div>

He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his father's behaviour…</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利听到远处传来很响的爆裂声。他朝左边一看，及时俯身躲了过去。弗雷德和乔治的飞天扫帚沿着走廊朝自己的主人迅速飞去，有一把扫帚的尾巴上还拖着乌姆里奇用来把它们拴在墙上的沉重铁链和铁栓；它们朝左一转，急速飞下楼梯，猛地停在双胞胎面前，铁链在带着旗帜标志的石头地板上发出了响亮的哗啦声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"STOP THEM!" shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拦住他们！”鸟姆里奇尖声喊道，但是太晚了。调查行动组逼近时，弗雷德和乔治双脚一蹬离开了地板，冲上了十五英尺高的空中，铁栓在扫帚下面吓人地荡来荡去。弗雷德望着跟自己同一高度的喜欢恶作剧的皮皮鬼正在门厅对面的人群头顶上飘来飘去。">查看中文翻译</div>
