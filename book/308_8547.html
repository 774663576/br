<div class="line_en">Yes, Mrs Folliott was at home. I was ushered into a big drawing-room, and looked round me curiously as I waited for the mistress of the house. A large bare room, some good bits of old china, and some beautiful etchings, shabby covers and curtains. A lady's room in every sense of the term.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，弗里奥特太太在家。我被领到一间宽敞的客厅。在等候女主人的时候，我好奇地环顾四周，只见一间空荡荡的大屋子，摆了几件不错的老式瓷器，几幅漂亮的铜版画，地毯和窗帘有些陈旧，一看便是一位女士的房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turned from the inspection of a Bartolozzi on the wall as Mrs Folliott came into the room. She was a tall woman, with untidy brown hair, and a very winning smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was slightly nervous when I rang the bell at Marby Grange the following afternoon. I wondered very much what Poirot expected to find out. He had entrusted the job to me. Why? Was it because, as in the case of questioning Major Blunt, he wished to remain in the background? The wish, intelligible in the first case, seemed to me quite meaningless here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天下午，按响马尔比农庄的门铃时，我心中有些紧张。我搞不懂波洛究竟想打听什么事。他为什么把这项任务全权托付给我？是因为他想隐身幕后，就像上次让我去盘问布兰特少校一样？对方是布兰特还好理解，而这一次，我就看不出有什么意义了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但很明显，她不想再对我多透露什么了。无论厄休拉·伯恩身上藏有怎样的秘密，从弗里奥特太太口中，也只能查到这里为止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One advantage of being a medical practitioner is that you can usually tell when people are lying to you. I should have know from Mrs Folliott's manner, if from nothing else, that she did mind answering my questions -- minded intensely. She was thoroughly uncomfortable and upset, and there was plainly some mystery in the background. I judged her to be a woman quite unused to deception of any kind, and consequently rendered acutely uneasy when forced to practise u- A child could have seen through her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身为职业医生的一大优势，就是总能看穿对方是否在撒谎。单凭弗里奥特太太的谈吐，我一眼就看出她的确对我的问题非常介意——简直介意到了极点。她坐立不安，心神不宁，这其中显然大有文章。据我判断，她是个极不善于说假话的女人，所以当她不得不违心作答时，难免就异常局促慌乱。这连三岁小孩都瞒不过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went to see a couple of patients and arrived home about six o'clock. Caroline was sitting beside the wreck of tea things. She had that look of suppressed exultation on her face which I know only too well. It is a sure sign with her of either the getting or the giving of information. I wondered which it had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我顺路探视了几个病人，六点钟左右才到家。卡洛琳坐在桌旁，桌上摆着吃剩的茶点。我看得出，她正竭力抑制内心的欢欣雀跃，因为那副表情我早就司空见惯了。她要么刚刚打听到了什么重大消息，要么就是刚刚把内幕散播出去，我不禁揣测村里又出了什么大新闻。">查看中文翻译</div>
