<div class="line_en">That would be a giant understatement anyway. She was the only person in class who'd read her poem like it wasn't an assignment. She recited it like it was a living thing. Like something she was letting out. You couldn't look away from her as long as she was talking. (Even more than Park's usual not being able to look away from her.) When she was done, a lot of people clapped and Mr Stessman hugged her. Which was totally against the Code of Conduct.</div>

<div class="line_en">He definitely wasn't one of them, the bus demons. He didn't talk to anyone on the bus. (Especially not her.) But he was in with them somehow because, when Eleanor was sitting next to him, they all left her alone. Even Tina. It made Eleanor wish she could sit next to him all day long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他绝对不是校车魔头那类人。他在车上不跟人交谈（特别是跟她）。但是他似乎又跟他们是一伙的，因为自从埃莉诺坐在他旁边，就连提娜也不来欺负她。埃莉诺真希望能整天都坐在他身边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This morning, when she got on the bus, it kind of felt like he was waiting for her. He was holding a comic called Watchmen, and it looked so ugly that Eleanor decided not to bother eavesdropping. Or eavesreading. Whatever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今早她踏上校车时，感觉他好像在等她，他拿着一本《守望者》漫画，丑到极点，埃莉诺决定不再偷听了，不，偷看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And which totally sucked because it meant he would read the rest of the comic during school, and have something lame like ROM out on the way home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="糟透了。这代表他会在学校看完剩下的部分，到放学的车上，他就会掏出类似《宇宙骑士罗恩》之类的玩意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(She liked it best when he read X-Men, even though she didn't get everything that was going on there; X-Men was worse than General Hospital. It took Eleanor a couple weeks to figure out that Scott Summers and Cyclops were the same guy, and she still wasn't sure what was up with Phoenix.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（她最喜欢他看《X战警》，虽然她还搞不太清楚故事的来龙去脉，简直比《总医院》还复杂。好几个星期后，埃莉诺才搞清楚镭射眼和独眼巨人是同一个人，但还没弄明白火凤凰发生了什么。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Eleanor didn't have anything else to do, so her eyes wandered over to the ugly comic… And then she was reading. And then they were at school. Which was totally weird because they weren't even halfway through with it.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were still reading it when they got to Eleanor's stop -- there was so much going on, they both stared at every frame for, like, entire minutes -- and when she got up to leave, he handed it to her.</div>
