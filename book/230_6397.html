<div class="line_en">This will had both worried and annoyed Mr Utterson. To a lawyer it was an unusual and dangerous kind of will. It was bad enough when Edward Hyde was only an unknown name, but now that the lawyer knew something about Hyde, the will worried him more than ever. It had seemed like madness before; now it began to seem shameful. With a heavy heart Mr Utterson replaced the envelope in the cupboard, put on his coat and went to see his old friend Doctor Lanyon.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner that evening Mr Utterson went into his office and unlocked a cupboard. He took out an envelope. It contained the will of Doctor Henry Jekyll, and was written in the doctor's own handwriting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，吃了饭，厄特森先生走进自己的办公室，打开柜橱上的锁，拿出一个信封，里面装的是亨利·杰基尔博士的遗嘱，是立书人亲笔写的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Doctor Lanyon was enjoying his after-dinner coffee. "Come in, old friend!" he cried. The two men had known each other since their school days. They sat for several minutes, drinking coffee and talking companionably of this and that. At last Mr Utterson mentioned the thoughts that were worrying him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰宁医生正在品着饭后的咖啡。“哈！老朋友，快进来！”他大声嚷着。他们俩从上学的时候起就认识。俩人坐在一起，一边喝咖啡，一边闲扯着，最后厄特森先生谈起了自己心中的不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Utterson looked at his friend's red, angry face. "Only a disagreement about some scientific question," he thought. "It's nothing worse than that." Calmly he continued, "Did you ever meet a friend of Jekyll's a man called Hyde?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄特森先生看着朋友气呼呼、涨红的脸，心想：“只不过是科学见解上的分歧，并没有什么大不了的。”他不动声色地又问：“你有没有见过杰基尔的一个朋友——一个叫海德的朋友？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We were at one time," said Doctor Lanyon. "But more than ten years ago Henry Jekyll became too -- well, imaginative for me. He developed some strange, wild, unscientific ideas. I told him so, and I've seen very little of him since then."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“曾经有过，”医生接着说，“不过，那是十多年前了。那以后，亨利·杰基尔变得——嗯，对我来讲太不可思议了。他脑子里装了一些奇怪、荒唐、不科学的想法，我就是这么和他说的，从那以后，我就很少见到他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon the lawyer said goodnight and went home to bed, where he lay awake for a long time thinking about Enfield's description of Hyde, and Doctor Jekyll's will. When at last he fell asleep, he was troubled by dreams. In his mind's eye he saw a faceless man marching over the child's body. Then he saw his old friend Jekyll in bed, while the same faceless figure stood over him. The facelessness of that figure worried him deeply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，律师道了晚安，回家睡觉，可他躺在床上好长时间还想着恩菲尔德说的海德的样子，还有杰基尔博士的遗嘱。好不容易睡着了，可是一个梦接着一个梦，让他心绪不宁。梦里仿佛看见一个没有脸的人重重踩过孩子的身体，又看见老朋友杰基尔躺在床上，那个没有脸的人站在他身上。那个没有脸的人着实让他担心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the next few weeks Mr Utterson spent many hours in the narrow street where Enfield had seen Hyde. He waited patiently near the mysterious door, hoping for a sight of Mr Hyde -- and one dry, clear winter night he was successful. The street was empty and silent and small sounds carried along way. The lawyer heard footsteps. He stepped back into the shadows and waited. A short figure turned the corner and walked towards the mysterious door. Although Mr Utterson could not see his face, he felt a strong, almost violent, dislike for the stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以后的好几个星期，厄特森先生在恩菲尔德看见海德的那条背街上徘徊了好久。他在那扇神秘的门旁耐心等着，希望能发现海德先生的踪迹。终于，一个清冷的冬夜他遇上了海德。那天晚上，街道空荡荡的，寂静无声，一点响动声都能传出去好远，律师突然听见了脚步声。他躲在阴暗处，等着。一个小个子男人转过街角，朝那扇神秘的门走去。虽然看不见陌生人的脸，但厄特森先生还是强烈地感到一种憎恨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪！”律师想，“海德一定知道杰基尔的遗嘱吧？他打的就是这个主意吧？”但律师没说出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Utterson stared at the closed door. "Why do I dislike him so much?" he said to himself. "Enfield was right -- there is something evil about the man. Poor Henry Jekyll, I'm worried about you. Your new friend will mean trouble for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄特森先生盯着紧闭的大门，自言自语道：“我怎么那么不喜欢他呢？恩菲尔德说得对，这个人骨子里有股邪气。可怜的亨利·杰基尔，真让人为你担心，你这个新朋友会给你惹麻烦的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He never told you!" cried Mr Hyde in sudden anger. "Don't lie to me!" And before the lawyer could answer, he turned the key in the lock and disappeared into the house.</div>
