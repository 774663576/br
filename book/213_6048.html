<div class="line_en">The key was around his neck on a piece of string. I cut the string, and we hurried up to his room where the chest had stood since the day he came. There was a letter "B" painted on the top of it. Inside were two very fine pistols, some silver, pipe-tobacco, and an old clock. Underneath these things were some papers tied up inside a cloth, and a bag of gold coins.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But first," my mother said bravely, "we have to get the key to the sea-chest. Why shouldn't we take the money the captain owes us? His friends certainly won't give it to us!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll show these scoundrels I'm an honest woman," said my mother. "I'll take what I'm owed and no more." She began counting the money. There were all kinds of gold coins in the bag -- big French gold coins, Spanish doubloons and pieces of eight. It was slow work to find the English gold guineas that we needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要让那些流氓知道，我是个诚实的女人，”母亲说。“我只要收回欠账，一个子儿也不多拿。”她开始数钱。那一个袋里各国钱币都有：法国的金路易，西班牙的杜布龙金币和每枚8个里亚尔的银币。从中找到我们需要的英国畿尼是件很费时的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were half-way through when I heard a sound that filled my heart with fear. the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick on the frozen road. Then it knocked against the inn door and we did not breathe. But then the tapping started again and slowly died away.</div>

Pew turned with a scream, but he turned the wrong way, and ran straight into the first of the horses. The rider tried to save him, but failed.

The doctor opened the paper and found a map of an island. There was a hill in the centre marked Spyglass, and several names that had been added later. There were three big black crosses -- two in the north of the island and one in the south-west. Beside the last cross were the words: Most of the treasure here. On the back of the paper, the same person had written:</div>
