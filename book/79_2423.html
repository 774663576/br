<div class="line_en">It wasn't the snowmobile he wanted but the gas can held onto the back by a pair of elastic straps. His hands, still clad in Howard Cottrell's blue mittens, seized the top strap and pulled it free as the hedge lion roared behind him -- a sound that seemed to be more in his head than outside of it. A hard, brambly slap to his left leg, making the knee sing with pain as it was driven in a way the joint had never been expected to bend.</div>

<div class="line_en">He yanked Cottrell's mitten off his right hand, tasting sodden wool and gasoline. He ripped up the hem of the parka and jammed his hand into his pants pocket. Down in there, along with his keys and his change, was a very battered old Zippo lighter. He had bought it in Germany in 1954. Once the hinge had broken and he had returned it to the Zippo factory and they had repaired it without charge, just as advertised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他扯掉右手上的连指手套，尝到了浸透的羊毛和汽油昧。然后他撩起风雪衣的边，手插进裤袋里。里面，与钥匙和零钱呆在一起的有一只非常破旧的老式齐波牌打火机，这是他1954年在德国买的。有一次打火机铰链坏了，他把它寄回厂家，他们免费给修好了，正如广告里所说的那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As it moved in again the cap spun free, releasing the pungent smell of the gasoline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它来到他跟前的时候，桶盖旋开了，刺鼻的汽油味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gas!" Hallorann cried, his voice shrill and breaking. "Gonna burn you, baby!</div>

<div class="line_en">Dig on it awhile!" The lion came at him again, still spitting angrily. Hallorann splashed it again but this time the lion didn't give. It charged ahead. Hallorann sensed rather than saw its head angling at his face and he threw himself backward, partially avoiding it. Yet the lion still hit his upper rib cage a glancing blow, and a flare of pain struck there. Gas gurgled out of the can, which he still held, and doused his right hand and arm, cold as death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子又向他袭来，怒气冲冲地发出呼噜声。哈洛伦又向它泼汽油，可这次狮子没有退，它向前扑来。哈洛伦意识到而不是看到它的头是冲着他的脸的，于是，他自己往后倒去，部分地避开了它。但是，狮子还是擦着打上了他的上肋骨架，一阵疼痛爆发出来了。他手里还抓着油桶，汽油汩汩流出来，浸湿了右手右臂，寒冷彻骨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he lay on his back in a snow angel, to the right of the snowmobile by about ten paces. The hissing lion was a bulking presence to his left, closing in again. Hallorann thought he could see its tail twitching.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lighter was out. He clicked the hood back. The lion, rushing at him, a growl like ripping cloth, his finger flicking the striker wheel, spark, flame, (my hand!) his gasoline-soaked hand suddenly ablaze, the flames running up the sleeve of the parka, no pain, no pain yet, the lion shying from the torch suddenly blazing in front of it, a hideous flickering hedge sculpture with eyes and a mouth, shying away, too late.</div>

<div class="line_en">He thrust his own arm deep into the snow, killing the flames, unable to take his eyes from the hedge lion's death agonies for a moment. Then, gasping, he got to his feet. The arm of Durkin's parka was sooty but unburned, and that also described his hand. Thirty yards downhill from where he stood, the hedge lion had turned into a fireball. Sparks flew at the sky and were viciously snatched away by the wind. For a moment its ribs and skull were etched in orange flame and then it seemed to collapse, disintegrate, and fall into separate burning piles.</div>

<div class="line_en">He picked up the gas can and struggled over to the snowmobile. His consciousness seemed to be flickering in and out, offering him cuttings and snippets of home movies but never the whole picture. In one of these he was aware of yanking the snowmobile back onto its tread and then sitting on it, out of breath and incapable of moving for a few moments. In another, he was reattaching the gas can, which was still half-full. His bead was thumping horribly from the gasfumes (and in reaction to his battle with the hedge lion, he supposed), and he saw by the steaming hole in the snow beside him that he had vomited, but he was unable to remember when.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他捡起汽油桶，挣扎着向雪地车走去。他的知觉时明时灭，为他提供着电影一样的剪辑和片断，但没有完整连续的画面。在其中的一幅图像中，他意识到自己把雪地车扳回到履带上，然后坐了上去，气喘吁吁，好长时间不能动弹。另一个片断里，他重新绑好汽油桶，里面还剩有半桶油。汽油味刺激得他头疼难忍（他想，这也是对这场撕打的反应），他还看见了雪地上的呕吐物，但记不起是什么时候吐的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The snowmobile, the engine still warm, fired immediately. He twisted the throttle unevenly and started forward with a series of neck-snapping jerks that made his head ache even more fiercely. At first the snowmobile wove drunkenly from side to side, but by half-standing to get his face above the windscreen and into the sharp, needling blast of the wind, he drove some of the stupor out of himself. He opened the throttle wider.</div>

<div class="line_en">He became aware of movement ahead of him in the dark. The hedge animals, all of them, were clustered at the base of the Overlook's steps, guarding the way in, the way out. The lions prowled. The dog stood with its front paws on the first step.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Overlook loomed in front of him, the lighted first-floor windows throwing long yellow rectangles onto the snow. The gate at the foot of the drive was locked and he dismounted after a wary look around, praying he hadn't lost his keys when he pulled his lighter out of his pocket… no, they were there. He picked through them in the bright light thrown by the snowmobile headlamp. He found the right one and unsnapped the padlock, letting it drop into the snow. At first he didn't think he was going to be able to move the gate anyway; he pawed frantically at the snow surrounding it, disregarding the throbbing agony in his head and the fear that one of the other lions might be creeping up behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="饭店赫然出现在他眼前，二楼窗户泻出的灯光在雪地上投下了黄色的长方块，进入饭店机动车道的大门锁着。他警惕地向四周看了看，然后下了车，默祷着自己从裤袋里掏打火机时没把钥匙弄丢了…没有，钥匙还在。在车前灯射出的光柱里，他在钥匙中寻找，终于找到了需要的那一把。他打开挂锁，任它掉进雪里。开始，他以为推不开大门；他不顾剧烈的头痛和又一头狮子从他背后偷袭而来的顾虑，发狂般地刨着大门周围的积雪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then it shrank away, leaving an opening. Hallorann yanked at the snowmobile's steering gear with all his remaining strength, and it kicked around in a sharp semicircle, throwing up clouds of snow, threatening to tip over. The rear end struck the foot of the porch steps and rebounded. Hallorann was off in a flash and running up the steps. He stumbled, fell, picked himself up. The dog was growling -- again in his head -- close behind him. Something ripped at the shoulder of the parka and then he was on the porch, standing in the narrow corridor Jack had shoveled through the snow, and safe. They were too big to fit in here.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann opened the throttle wide and the snowmobile leaped forward, puffing snow up behind it.
