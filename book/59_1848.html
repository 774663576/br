<div class="line_en">In the passengers' sitting room on the For farshire Mrs Dawson looked unhappily at Daniel, Mr Robb, and two other men -- Thomas Buchanan and James Kelly. Her two children were crying in her arms. "I'm so frightened. Do you think we're going to die? What can we do, Mr Donovan, without the engines?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not much, Mrs Dawson," said Daniel slowly. "But there are some islands, south of here, called the Farne Islands. They are very near. I've seen the lighthouse flashing on them. I think the captain is trying to go into the quieter water between the islands and the mainland. I… I'll go outside again, to see how near the lighthouse is. I'll come back and tell you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没多少办法，道森夫人，”丹尼尔缓缓地说，“但是这里有一些岛屿，就在南边，叫法恩群岛。它们离这儿很近。我看到岛上灯塔的闪光了。我想船长正在试图驶入群岛和大陆之间平缓的水域。我…我再出去一趟，看看灯塔有多近。我会回来告诉您的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Daniel got up and went out into the night. It was raining hard now, and the wind was screaming from the back of the ship. He stared into the dark. He could see nothing in the west. Where was the light? He walked carefully across the ship, to the other side. Suddenly he fell on the wet deck, and he caught the side of the ship with his hands. Then he looked up, and a light flashed into his eyes. There it was -- the lighthouse, only three hundred metres away, to the north!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼尔站起来，走入外面的夜色中。此刻雨下得很大，风从船尾呼啸而来。他向黑暗中望去，西边什么都没有。刚才的亮光在哪边来着？他小心翼翼地走到船的另一边。突然他滑倒在湿漉漉的甲板上，他用双手抓住船侧，然后抬头一看，一道亮光闪入他的眼帘。就在那里——那座灯塔，就在三百米以外，就在北边！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stood up and began to run along the deck. But there in front of him, a great mountain of white water flew into the sky… ten… twenty metres above the ship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then another very big wave hit the ship. White water flew everywhere, and fell on Daniel like stones. He heard a terrible crash, and more water fell on him. He opened his eyes, and looked back along the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在此时，又一个巨浪击中轮船。四溅的水花像石头般砸在丹尼尔身上。他听到一声可怕的撞击声，更多海水落到他身上。他睁开眼，回头看船上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain was already shouting at the sailors, and the ship was turning, turning to the west, away from the light. But it was too late. There was a great crash, and Daniel and all the sailors fell to the deck. Then another crash… and another. The waves lifted the For farshire and threw it onto the rock, like a child playing with a toy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻船长已经在冲着水手们大喊了。船在转向，朝西转，偏离了亮光的方向，但为时已晚。随着一次剧烈的撞击，丹尼尔和所有水手都摔倒在甲板上。接着又一次撞击…再一次。巨浪将福法尔郡号抛起来，又摔到暗礁上，就像一个孩子扔着玩具。">查看中文翻译</div>
