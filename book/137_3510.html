<div class="line_en">While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some groom who had stolen in, the usher stopped him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Coppenole proudly saluted his eminence, who returned the salute of the all-powerful bourgeois feared by Louis XI. Then, while Guillaume Rym, a "sage and malicious man," as Philippe de Comines puts it, watched them both with a smile of raillery and superiority, each sought his place, the cardinal quite abashed and troubled, Coppenole tranquil and haughty, and thinking, no doubt, that his title of hosier was as good as any other, after all, and that Marie of Burgundy, mother to that Marguerite whom Coppenole was to-day bestowing in marriage, would have been less afraid of the cardinal than of the hosier; for it is not a cardinal who would have stirred up a revolt among the men of Ghent against the favorites of the daughter of Charles the Bold; it is not a cardinal who could have fortified the populace with a word against her tears and prayers, when the Maid of Flanders came to supplicate her people in their behalf, even at the very foot of the scaffold; while the hosier had only to raise his leather elbow, in order to cause to fall your two heads, most illustrious seigneurs, Guy d'Hymbercourt and Chancellor Guillaume Hugonet.</div>

<div class="line_en">The reader has, probably, not forgotten the impudent beggar who had been clinging fast to the fringes of the cardinal's gallery ever since the beginning of the prologue. The arrival of the illustrious guests had by no means caused him to relax his hold, and, while the prelates and ambassadors were packing themselves into the stalls -- like genuine Flemish herrings -- he settled himself at his ease, and boldly crossed his legs on the architrave. The insolence of this proceeding was extraordinary, yet no one noticed it at first, the attention of all being directed elsewhere. He, on his side, perceived nothing that was going on in the hall; he wagged his head with the unconcern of a Neapolitan, repeating from time to time, amid the clamor, as from a mechanical habit, "Charity, please!" And, assuredly, he was, out of all those present, the only one who had not deigned to turn his head at the altercation between Coppenole and the usher. Now, chance ordained that the master hosier of Ghent, with whom the people were already in lively sympathy, and upon whom all eyes were riveted -- should come and seat himself in the front row of the gallery, directly above the mendicant; and people were not a little amazed to see the Flemish ambassador, on concluding his inspection of the knave thus placed beneath his eyes, bestow a friendly tap on that ragged shoulder. The beggar turned round; there was surprise, recognition, a lighting up of the two countenances, and so forth; then, without paying the slightest heed in the world to the spectators, the hosier and the wretched being began to converse in a low tone, holding each other's hands, in the meantime, while the rags of Clopin Trouillefou, spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais, produced the effect of a caterpillar on an orange.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读者大概还没忘记，开场诗刚开始时爬到红衣主教看台边上的那个厚颜无耻的乞丐吧？即使达官贵人们到来，他也没有松手溜下去；当高级教士们和御使们像真正的弗兰德尔青鱼一般，拥挤在看台上，纷纷在高背交椅上就座时，他把自己的姿式摆得更舒服了，干脆两腿交叉盘住了柱顶托。唐突无礼，真是世间少有！不过，起初并未有人发现，既然大家的注意力都转向别处了。他呢，也好像没有觉察大厅里有什么事情，只是摇晃着脑袋，表现出那种那不勒斯人典型的无忧无虑的神情；在一片嗡嗡声中，仿佛习惯性机械动作，不时叫喊：“可怜可怜吧！”诚然，在所有观众中大概只有他不屑于扭过头去听听科柏诺和门官的争执。然而，很不凑巧，根特的袜商老倌——民众已经强烈同情而且大家仰望的科柏诺，正好坐在乞丐头顶上看台的第一排。这位弗兰德尔御使仔细看了看眼皮子下面的这个贱人，便伸出手臂，友善地拍拍他破衣烂衫下的肩膀，——见此情景，大家吃惊不小。乞丐猛一回头，两人的脸上都流露出惊讶、相识、喜悦之至的神情……然后，全然不顾观众，袜商和病鬼手拉着手，低声说起话来。这时候，克洛班·特鲁伊甫的褴褛衣衫展现在看台的金光灿烂铺垫之上，就跟毛毛虫衬托在美丽的柑橘上一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The novelty of this singular scene excited such a murmur of mirth and gayety in the hall, that the cardinal was not slow to perceive it; he half bent forward, and, as from the point where he was placed he could catch only an imperfect view of Trouillerfou's ignominious doublet, he very naturally imagined that the mendicant was asking alms, and, disgusted with his audacity, he exclaimed: "Bailiff of the Courts, toss me that knave into the river!"</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the hall, backed against the western wall, a large and magnificent gallery draped with cloth of gold, into which enter in procession, through a small, arched door, grave personages, announced successively by the shrill voice of an usher. On the front benches were already a number of venerable figures, muffled in ermine, velvet, and scarlet. Around the dais -- which remains silent and dignified -- below, opposite, everywhere, a great crowd and a great murmur. Thousands of glances directed by the people on each face upon the dais, a thousand whispers over each name. Certainly, the spectacle is curious, and well deserves the attention of the spectators. But yonder, quite at the end, what is that sort of trestle work with four motley puppets upon it, and more below? Who is that man beside the trestle, with a black doublet and a pale face?

<div class="line_en">From the moment of the cardinal's entrance, Gringoire had never ceased to tremble for the safety of his prologue. At first he had enjoined the actors, who had stopped in suspense, to continue, and to raise their voices; then, perceiving that no one was listening, he had stopped them; and, during the entire quarter of an hour that the interruption lasted, he had not ceased to stamp, to flounce about, to appeal to Gisquette and Liénarde, and to urge his neighbors to the continuance of the prologue; all in vain. No one quitted the cardinal, the embassy, and the gallery -- sole centre of this vast circle of visual rays. We must also believe, and we say it with regret, that the prologue had begun slightly to weary the audience at the moment when his eminence had arrived, and created a diversion in so terrible a fashion. After all, on the gallery as well as on the marble table, the spectacle was the same: the conflict of Labor and Clergy, of Nobility and Merchandise. And many people preferred to see them alive, breathing, moving, elbowing each other in flesh and blood, in this Flemish embassy, in this Episcopal court, under the cardinal's robe, under Coppenole's jerkin, than painted, decked out, talking in verse, and, so to speak, stuffed beneath the yellow amid white tunics in which Gringoire had so ridiculously clothed them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="红衣主教一进来，格兰古瓦就活动不已，力求挽救他的开场诗。他先是恳求陷于停顿的演员继续演下去而且提高嗓门，然后，看见没有一个人在听，他只好吩咐他们辍演；中断到现在将近一刻钟了，他不停地顿足，不停地奔走，不停地向吉丝盖特和莉娜德呼吁，不停地鼓动周围的群众要求继续演戏。然而，完全白费了劲。谁也不把目光从红衣主教、御使团、看台上转移过来，那里才是这一大片广阔视界的唯一中心。还必须认为，我们也要遗憾地指出：红衣主教莅临，那样可怕地分散了他们的注意力的时候，开场诗早已有点使观众厌烦了。说到底，看台上也好，戏台上也好，演的都是一码事，都是劳工和教士的冲突，贵族和商人的冲突。许许多多的人宁愿干脆看见他们有血有肉，活生生的，呼吸着，活动着，挤撞着，体现为弗兰德尔御使团，体现为那些教士随从，在红衣主教大红袍里面，在科柏诺皮革袄子下面，而不愿看见他们化作格兰古瓦给予古怪打扮的、身穿半黄半白宽长袍的四个木头人，涂脂抹粉，奇装异服，用韵文说话，简直就是稻草做的！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, in fact, difficult to imagine a more ingenious and more dramatic composition. The four personages of the prologue were bewailing themselves in their mortal embarrassment, when Venus in person, (vera incessa patuit dea) presented herself to them, clad in a fine robe bearing the heraldic device of the ship of the city of Paris. She had come herself to claim the dolphin promised to the most beautiful. Jupiter, whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing-room, supported her claim, and Venus was on the point of carrying it off,-- that is to say, without allegory, of marrying monsieur the dauphin, when a young child clad in white damask, and holding in her hand a daisy (a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of Flanders) came to contest it with Venus.</div>

On the entrance of the cardinal, one would have said that an invisible magic thread had suddenly drawn all glances from the marble table to the gallery, from the southern to the western extremity of the hall. Nothing could disenchant the audience; all eyes remained fixed there, and the new-comers and their accursed names, and their faces, and their costumes, afforded a continual diversion. This was very distressing. With the exception of Gisquette and Liénarde, who turned round from time to time when Gringoire plucked them by the sleeve; with the exception of the big, patient neighbor, no one listened, no one looked at the poor, deserted morality full face.

I have been waiting for the first blow this quarter of an hour; nothing comes; they are cowards who only scratch each other with insults. You ought to send for the fighters of London or Rotterdam; and, I can tell you! you would have had blows of the fist that could be heard in the Place; but these men excite our pity. They ought at least, to give us a moorish dance, or some other mummer! That is not what was told me; I was promised a feast of fools, with the election of a pope. We have our pope of fools at Ghent also; we're not behindhand in that, cross of God! But this is the way we manage it; we collect a crowd like this one here, then each person in turn passes his head through a hole, and makes a grimace at the rest; time one who makes the ugliest, is elected pope by general acclamation; that's the way it is. It is very diverting. Would you like to make your pope after the fashion of my country? At all events, it will be less wearisome than to listen to chatterers. If they wish to come and make their grimaces through the hole, they can join the game. What say you, Messieurs les bourgeois?
