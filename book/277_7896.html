<div class="line_en">Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow. Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic. It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating. These are the great truths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised. Poor Hughie! Intellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance. He never said a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life. But then he was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes. He was as popular with men as he was with women, and he had every accomplishment except that of making money. His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword, and a History of the Peninsular War in fifteen volumes. Hughie hung the first over his looking-glass, put the second on a shelf between Ruff's Guide and Bailey's Magazine, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him. He had tried everything. He had gone on the Stock Exchange for six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears? He had been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of pekoe and souchong. Then he had tried selling dry sherry. That did not answer; the sherry was a little too dry. Ultimately he became nothing, a delightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no profession.</div>

<div class="line_en">To make matters worse, he was in love. The girl he loved was Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper and his digestion in India, and had never found either of them again. Laura adored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings. They were the handsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between them. The Colonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear of any engagement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更糟糕的是，他还在谈情说爱。他爱的女孩劳拉·默顿是一位退休上校的女儿。上校在印度失去了绝好的脾气和胃口，从此再没找回来过。劳拉爱慕他，而他也情愿去吻她的鞋带。他们是伦敦最漂亮的情侣，却身无分文。上校非常喜欢休伊，但拒绝考虑任何订婚之事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come to me, my boy, when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own, and we will see about it," he used to say; and Hughie looked very glum on those days, and had to go to Laura for consolation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的孩子，当你有一万英镑的时候，再来找我，我们再考虑这件事。”他常常这么说。那些日子休伊一副闷闷不乐的样子，不得不去找劳拉寻求安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One morning, as he was on his way to Holland Park, where the Mertons lived, he dropped in to see a great friend of his, Alan Trevor. Trevor was a painter. Indeed, few people escape that nowadays. But he was also an artist, and artists are rather rare. Personally he was a strange rough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged beard. However, when he took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly sought after. He had been very much attracted by Hughie at first, it must be acknowledged, entirely on account of his personal charm. "The only people a painter should know," he used to say, "are people who are bete and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and an intellectual repose to talk to. Men who are dandies and women who are darlings rule the world, at least they should do so." However, after he got to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much for his bright buoyant spirits and his generous reckless nature, and had given him the permanent entree to his studio.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早上，在前往默顿家所在的荷兰公园的途中，他顺便走访了自己的好友艾伦·特雷弗。特雷弗是一位画家。实际上，如今的人们不是画家的寥寥无几。不过，他也是一位艺术家，艺术家则相当罕见。他本人是一个奇怪粗暴的家伙，一脸雀斑，红髯蓬乱。然而，当拿起画笔的时候，他是一位真正的大师，他的画作受到人们的热烈追捧。一开始，他就十分喜欢休伊，我们必须承认这完全是因为他的个人魅力。“画家唯一应该认识的人，”他常说，“是愚蠢而又美丽的人，是看起来赏心悦目，谈起天来蠢笨无聊的人。花花公子和漂亮女人统治世界，至少他们应该这样做。”不过，渐渐地熟悉休伊之后，他也喜欢上了对方愉快活跃的性情和大方率真的本性，并允许他自由进出自己的画室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="休伊进来的时候，发现特雷弗正在给一幅乞丐肖像画画最后几笔。乞丐本人站在画室角落的一个高台上。这是一个干瘪的老头，脸像皱羊皮纸似的，一副可怜巴巴的表情，肩上搭着一件质地粗劣、破烂不堪的棕色外衣，厚靴子补丁摞补丁，一只手拄着一根粗糙的拐杖，另一只手伸出破帽子来请求施舍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"An amazing model?" shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; "I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“令人震惊的模特？”特雷弗扯着嗓子嚷道，“我想的确如此！他这样的乞丐不是每天都会遇到的。一次意外的收获，亲爱的，一幅活生生的媲美委拉斯开兹的画！我的天哪！要是让伦勃朗来画他，他一定会做出一幅蚀刻版画！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Certainly," replied Trevor, "you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?"</div>

Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“胡说，胡说！啊，看看仅仅涂抹颜料有多么麻烦，还要一天到晚站在画架边！休伊，你说得很对，但你应该相信，有些时候艺术工作几乎应该得到和体力工作一样的尊敬。不过，你也不要喋喋不休，我很忙。抽一支烟，保持安静。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the frame-maker wanted to speak to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor's absence to rest for a moment on a wooden bench that was behind him. He looked so forlorn and wretched that Hughie could not help pitying him, and felt in his pockets to see what money he had. All he could find was a sovereign and some coppers. "Poor old fellow," he thought to himself, "he wants it more than I do, but it means no hansoms for a fortnight;" and he walked across the studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggar's hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老乞丐趁特雷弗不在，便去他身后的木凳上休息。他看上去是那样无助又可怜，休伊不由得怜悯他，在口袋里摸了摸，看自己有多少钱。他所能找到的只有一枚金币和一些铜币。“可怜的老家伙，”他暗自想道，“他比我更需要钱，给他这些钱只不过意味着我两星期不坐马车罢了。”他穿过画室，然后把那枚金币轻轻地放在了乞丐的手里。">查看中文翻译</div>
