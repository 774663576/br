<div class="line_en">Park turned to walk away from the house, but the little brown truck whipped too fast into the driveway, jumping the curb and nearly clipping him. Park stopped on the sidewalk and waited. The driver's side door swung open.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor's stepdad -- Richie -- leaned slowly out of the cab. Park recognized him from the one time he'd seen him before, when Park had brought Eleanor the second issue of Watchmen, and her stepdad had answered the door…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺的继父雷奇缓缓地踏上路阶。帕克认识他，他们见过一面，那次帕克拿《守望者》第二期来给埃莉诺，是他开的门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The final issue of Watchmen came out a few months after Eleanor left. He wondered if she'd read it, and whether she thought Ozymandias was a villain, and what she thought Dr Manhattan meant when he said, "Nothing ever ends" at the end. Park still wondered what Eleanor thought about everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《守望者》的最后一期几个月前出版了，不知道埃莉诺看过没有。她会认为智谋者是大坏蛋吗？对曼哈顿博士在结局说“没有任何事情会真正结束”，埃莉诺有什么看法？帕克依旧想知道埃莉诺对所有事情的看法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her stepdad didn't see Park at first. Richie was moving slowly, uncertainly. When he did notice Park, he looked at him like he wasn't sure he was really there. "Who are you?" Richie shouted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺的继父一开始没看见帕克。他动作缓慢，步履迟疑。看到帕克后，又好像根本不确定眼前有人一样，大叫：“你是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park didn't answer. Richie turned jaggedly, jerking toward him. "What do you want?" Even from a few feet away, he smelled sour. Like beer, like basements.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克没回应。雷奇扭转着身体，跌跌撞撞地走向帕克：“你要干吗？”虽然隔了几英尺，帕克仍能闻到他浑身的酸臭味。像啤酒。像地下室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="帕克站着不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I want to kill you, he thought. And I can, he realized. I should.</div>

<div class="line_en">Richie wasn't much bigger than Park, and he was drunk and disoriented. Plus, he could never want to hurt Park as much as Park wanted to hurt him.</div>

<div class="line_en">And I can.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可以杀了你。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Richie shuffled closer. "What do you want?" he shouted again. The force of his own voice knocked him off balance and he tipped forward, falling thickly to the ground. Park had to step back not to catch him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷奇拖着脚步前进，再次大吼：“你要干什么？”他说话的力道太大，失去了平衡，往前跌了一跤，重重地摔在了地上，帕克还得往后跳，才没被撞到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="该有人杀了你才对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park looked down at his steel-toe Docs. He'd just bought them at work. (On sale, with his employee discount.) He looked at Richie's head, hanging from his neck like a leather bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克低头看着自己脚尖包铁的马丁靴，他刚在工作地点买的。（本来就在打折，再加上他的员工折扣。）他看看雷奇的脑袋，此刻像个瘫软在脖子上的皮袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park hated him more than he thought it was possible to hate someone. More than he'd ever thought it was possible to feel anything… Almost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克从没想过他可以这么恨一个人，这种感觉远超过他曾有过的所有感觉…所有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lifted his boot and kicked the ground in front of Richie's face. Ice and mud and driveway slopped into the older man's open mouth. Richie coughed violently and banked into the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬起靴子，踢了踢雷奇脸旁的泥土。冰雪混着车道上的泥土飞进了雷奇的嘴巴，他猛烈咳嗽，跌倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="帕克等着他起身，但是雷奇就一直躺在那儿，嘴里骂骂咧咧，用力揉着眼睛上的盐和碎土（124）。【注：（124）下雪时，马路与车道上会撒盐防止结冰。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Letters, postcards, yellow padded packages that rattled in her hands. None of them opened, none of them read.</div>
