<div class="line_en">As usual, Lily thought. There was always something that had to be done at that precise moment, something that Mrs Ramsay had decided for reasons of her own to do instantly, it might be with every one standing about making jokes, as now, not being able to decide whether they were going into the smoking-room, into the drawing-room, up to the attics. Then one saw Mrs Ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with Minta's arm in hers, bethink her, "Yes, it is time for that now," and so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone. And directly she went a sort of disintegration set in; they wavered about, went different ways, Mr Bankes took Charles Tansley by the arm and went off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner about politics, thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening, making the weight fall in a different direction, as if, Lily thought, seeing them go, and hearing a word or two about the policy of the Labour Party, they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were taking their bearings; the change from poetry to politics struck her like that; so Mr Bankes and Charles Mrs Ramsay going upstairs in the lamplight alone. Where, Lily wondered, was she going so quickly?</div>

<div class="line_en">Not that she did in fact run or hurry; she went indeed rather slowly. She felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter, and pick out one particular thing; the thing that mattered; to detach it; separate it off; clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things, and so hold it before her, and bring it to the tribunal where, ranged about in conclave, sat the judges she had set up to decide these things. Is it good, is it bad, is it right or wrong? Where are we all going to? and so on. So she righted herself after the shock of the event, and quite unconsciously and incongruously, used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position. Her world was changing: they were still. The event had given her a sense of movement. All must be in order. She must get that right and that right, she thought, insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees' stillness, and now again of the superb upward rise (like the beak of a ship up a wave) of the elm branches as the wind raised them. For it was windy (she stood a moment to look out). It was windy, so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star, and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves. Yes, that was done then, accomplished; and as with all things done, became solemn. Now one thought of it, cleared of chatter and emotion, it seemed always to have been, only was shown now and so being shown, struck everything into stability. They would, she thought, going on again, however long they lived, come back to this night; this moon; this wind; this house: and to her too. It flattered her, where she was most susceptible of flattery, to think how, wound about in their hearts, however long they lived she would be woven; and this, and this, and this, she thought, going upstairs, laughing, but affectionately, at the sofa on the landing (her mother's); at the rocking-chair (her father's); at the map of the Hebrides. All that would be revived again in the lives of Paul and Minta; "the Rayleys"-- she tried the new name over; and she felt, with her hand on the nursery door, that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically (the feeling was one of relief and happiness) it was all one stream, and chairs, tables, maps, were hers, were theirs, it did not matter whose, and Paul and Minta would carry it on when she was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她其实并没有跑也没有急匆匆的样子；实际上她走得很慢。在这么多的无休止的谈论以后，她很想静静地站上一会儿，把那件特殊的事情分辨开来；那件重要的事；把它分离出来；和别的分开；清除上面的一切感情因素和细枝末节，然后举在眼前，把它带上审判席，在那儿，她为裁定此类事情而设立的法庭的法官们在秘密审议，是好，是坏，是对，是错？我们在走向何处？等等。就这样她在这一事件带来的震惊中恢复了常态。她相当无意识地、不近情理地利用窗外的榆树枝来帮助自己稳定立场。她的世界正在起着变化：树枝静止不动。那件事给了她一种动感。一切必须有序地进行。她想，她必须把事情一件件安排好，她莫名其妙地对榆树的静止的威严赞许起来，现在又欣赏榆树枝被风向上托起时的壮丽情景（就像托起在风浪之上的船头）。因为风很大（她在那儿站民片刻，向窗外看着）。风很大，摇曳的树叶间不时露出颗颗星星，而星星本身似乎也在摇动投射出光芒，拼命要在树叶的缝隙间闪现。“是的，那么这件事已经成了，完成了；并且和所有已经完成的事情一样，变得庄严起来。”现在没有了人们的谈沦和感情的因素，她想到它时觉得它似乎一直都是如此，只不过现在才表现了出来，而表现了出来就使一切变得稳定。她继续想道，无论他们活多久，他们会回到这个夜晚；这轮明月；这晚风；这所房子上来：也回到她身边来。想到无论他们活多久，都会把她深深地织进他们的心田，这使她感到很得意，而这正是她最容易被人们的奉承打动的方面。她一面上楼一面充满深情地说，这个，这个，这个，笑着，笑楼梯平台处的那张沙发（她母亲的）、那把摇椅（她父亲的）、和那张赫不里底群岛的地图。这一切都将在保罗和明塔——“雷勒夫妇”（她试着说了几遍这个新的名字）的生活中被记起；她把手放在育儿室的门上，感受到由感情而生的与别人之间的情感上的一致，仿佛分隔开他们的墙已变得如此之薄，实际上（这是一种宽慰和幸福的感觉）一切都在同一条溪流之中，椅子、桌子、地图，是她的，是他们的，是谁的都没关系，在她去世以后，保罗和明塔将把一切继续下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Cam must go to sleep (it had great horns said Cam)-- must go to sleep and dream of lovely bed by her side. She could see the horns, Cam said, all over the room. It was true. Wherever they put the light (and James could not sleep without a light) there was always a shadow somewhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆齐夫人在卡姆的床沿上坐下，说，好啦，卡姆得睡觉啦（卡姆说它有大犄角呢——）睡着了做个好梦，梦见漂亮的宫殿。她看见犄角了，卡姆说，屋子里到处都是犄角。这是真的。无论他们把灯放在哪儿（没有灯詹姆斯睡不着觉），总有头骨的影子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned the handle, firmly, lest it should squeak, and went in, pursing her lips slightly, as if to remind herself that she must not speak aloud. But directly she came in she saw, with annoyance, that the precaution was not needed. The children were not asleep. It was most annoying. Mildred should be more careful. There was James wide awake and Cam sitting bolt upright, and Mildred out of bed in her bare feet, and it was almost eleven and they were all talking. What was the matter? It was that horrid skull again. She had told Mildred to move it, but Mildred, of course, had forgotten, and now there was Cam wide awake, and James wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been asleep hours ago. What had possessed Edward to send them this horrid skull? She had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there. It was nailed fast, Mildred said, and Cam couldn't go to sleep with it in the room, and James screamed if she touched it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她稳稳地转动门把手，以免发出吱嘎声，然后走进了房间，嘴唇微微吸起，好像在提醒自己不要大声说话。但她一走进门便很恼火地发现她根本用不着这么小心。孩子们都没有睡着呢。这真让人生气。米尔德里得应该更仔细些才对。詹姆斯在那儿大睁着眼睛，卡姆则直挺挺地坐着，米尔德里得光着脚站在地上。已经快十一点了，可他们还都在聊天。这是怎么回事？又是那个讨厌的头骨。她告诉过米尔德里得把它拿走，可是，当然，米尔德里得是不会记住的，现在结果是卡姆醒着，詹姆斯醒着，争吵不休，而他们本该几个小时前就睡着了的。究竟是什么鬼迷了爱德华的心窍，给他们寄了这么个讨厌的头骨来？她也真傻，居然让他们把它钉在了墙上。米尔德里得说，钉得特别结实，那东西在房间里卡姆睡不着觉，而她一碰它詹姆斯就尖叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well then," said Mrs Ramsay, "we will cover it up," and they all watched her go to the chest of drawers, and open the little drawers quickly one after another, and not seeing anything that would do, she quickly took her own shawl off and wound it round the skull, round and round and round, and then she came back to Cam and laid her head almost flat on the pillow beside Cam's and said how lovely it looked now; how the fairies would love it; it was like a bird's nest; it was like a beautiful mountain such as she had seen abroad, with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds singing and little goats and antelopes and… She could see the words echoing as she spoke them rhythmically in Cam's mind, and Cam was repeating after her how it was like a mountain, a bird's nest, a garden, and there were little antelopes, and her eyes were opening and shutting, and Mrs Ramsay went on speaking still more monotonously, and more rhythmically and more nonsensically, how she must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of mountains and valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and gardens, and everything lovely, she said, raising her head very slowly and speaking more and more mechanically, until she sat upright and saw that Cam was asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么好吧，”拉姆齐夫人说，“咱们把它给蒙上，”他们看着她走到五斗柜前，很快地打开一个个小抽屉，没有找到能用的东西，便很快解下自己的披巾，裹在了头骨上，裹了一道又一道，然后回到卡姆身边，把头几乎平放在卡姆头旁的枕头上，说现在它看上去有多么可爱；仙女们也会喜欢它的；它像一个鸟窝了；它像她在国外时看到过的美丽的山峰，有山谷、鲜花、铃声叮当、小鸟歌唱、还有小山羊和羚羊……她能感觉到当她有节奏地说着时，这些词句在卡姆的脑海中回响，跟着她重复它怎样像一座山峰、一个鸟窝、一所花园、里面有小羚羊，她的眼睛一睁一闭，拉姆齐夫人继续用更加单调的声音、更加有节奏地说着更加没有内容的话，说她必须闭上眼睛睡觉，她会梦见山峰、山谷、以及所有好看的东西，她说，—面很慢很慢地把头从枕头上抬起，声音越来越机械，直到最后身子完全坐直了起来，看到卡姆睡着了为止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, she whispered, crossing over to his bed, James must go to sleep too, for see, she said, the boar's skull was still there; they had not touched it; quite unhurt. He made sure that the skull was still there under the shawl. But he wanted to ask her something more. Would they go to the Lighthouse tomorrow?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走向詹姆斯的床旁，轻声说，现在詹姆斯也该睡觉了，因为，你看，野猪的头骨还在那儿；他们没有碰它；他们是按他希望的做的；它在那儿，一点也没有受到伤害。他弄确实了头骨真的在那披巾的下面。但是他还想问她别的事。他们明天会到灯塔去吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She hoped he would not bang his books on the floor above their heads, she thought, still thinking how annoying Charles Tansley was. For neither of them slept well; they were excitable children, and since he said things like that about the Lighthouse, it seemed to her likely that he would knock a pile of books over, just as they were going to sleep, clumsily sweeping them off the table with his elbow. For she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work. Yet he looked so desolate; yet she would feel relieved when he went; yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow; yet he was admirable with her husband; yet his manners certainly wanted improving; yet she liked his laugh -- thinking this, as she came downstairs, she noticed that she could now see the moon itself through the staircase window -- the yellow harvest moon -- and turned, and they saw her, standing above them on the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她希望查尔斯·坦斯利不要在他们脑袋顶上把书往楼板上摔得砰砰响。她想道，心里仍在想他多么令人生气。因为这两个孩子睡觉都不好；他们很容易兴奋，由于坦斯利关于灯塔的事说过那样一番话，她觉得他可能会在他们就要睡着时笨手笨脚地用胳膊肘把桌上的一摞书碰翻到地上。她猜想他已经上楼去工作了。他显得那么孤独寂寞；但他走后她会觉得松了一口气；不过她会设法让他明天受到更好的对待；他对他丈夫可不错；可是他的举止态度实在需要改进；然而她喜欢他笑的样子——他一面想着这些，一面走下楼来，突然她注意到她能从楼梯的窗子里看见月亮了——那一轮金黄色的、秋收后的第一次满月——于是她转过身来，这时他们看见了她，站在他们上方的楼梯上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, not tomorrow, she said, but soon, she promised him; the next fine day. He was very good. He lay down. She covered him up. But he would never forget, she knew, and she felt angry with Charles Tansley, with her husband, and with herself, for she had raised his hopes. Then feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had wrapped it round the boar's skull, she got up, and pulled the window down another inch or two, and heard the wind, and got a breath of the perfectly indifferent chill night air and murmured good night to Mildred and left the room and let the tongue of the door slowly lengthen in the lock and went out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，明天不去，她说，不过很快就会去的，她向他保证；下一个好天气就去。他很听话。他躺了下去。她给他盖好了被子。但是她知道他永远不会忘记这事，她感到很生查尔斯·坦斯利、她丈夫和她自己的气。因为她使他产生了希望。这时她伸手去摸披巾，想起她已经用它来裹野猪的头骨了，便站起身来，把窗子又往下拉了一两英寸。她听见了风声，吸进了一口夜晚毫无感情的凉飕飕的空气，低声和米尔德里得道了晚安，便离开房间。她让门把手里的舌簧慢慢伸进锁槽，然后走了开去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's my mother," thought Prue. Yes; Minta should look at her; Paul Rayley should look at her. That is the thing itself, she felt, as if there were only one person like that in the world; her mother. And, from having been quite grown up, a moment before, talking with the others, she became a child again, and what they had been doing was a game, and would her mother sanction their game, or condemn it, she wondered. And thinking what a chance it was for Minta and Paul and Lily to see her, and feeling what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it was for her, to have her, and how she would never grow up and never leave home, she said, like a child, "We thought of going down to the beach to watch the waves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就是我的母亲，”普鲁想。是的，明塔应该看看她；保罗·雷勒应该看看她。她感到那就是事物的本质，似乎在这个世界上只有一个这样的人；那就是她的母亲。她从刚才和别人聊天时觉得自己是个大人，现在一下子又变成了个孩子，他们刚才的所作所为只是一场游戏，她不知道母亲会认可他们的游戏还是会谴责他们的游戏；她想这是个多么难得的机会，让明塔、保罗和莉莉看看她，她觉得自己有这样的母亲是多么幸运，她永远也不愿长大不愿离开家，于是便像个孩子似的说道，“我们刚才想着要到海滩上去看海浪呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Of course it was impossible for her to go with them.
