<div class="line_en">The Baker brothers' names are Matt and Mike, but even now I can't tell you which one's which. You never see one without the other. And even though they're not twins, they do look and sound pretty much the same, and they're both in Lynetta's class, so maybe one of them got held back. Although I can't exactly see a teacher voluntarily having either of those maniacs two years in a row.</div>

Lynetta had this major-league thing for Skyler Brown, who lives about three blocks down, and every chance she got, she went down there to hang out while he practiced the drums.

<div class="line_en">So Lynetta got another one of her teenage time-outs, and after that any time Lynetta was two minutes late coming home for dinner, my mother would messenger me down to Skyler's house to drag her home. It might have been embarrassing for Lynetta, but it was worse for me. I was still in elementary school, and the Mystery Pisser guys were in high school. They were ripe and ragged, raging power chords through the neighborhood, while I looked like I'd just gotten back from Sunday school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是琳内塔得到了另一个青春期隔离，在那之后琳内塔总是晚两分钟回家吃晚饭，我妈妈会叫我去Skyler家把她拉回家。也许这对琳内塔很尴尬，但是我更惨。我那时还在上小学，而他们已经在高中。他们显得很成熟，穿着衣衫褴褛，为邻居制造了破碎的噪音，而我看起来像刚刚从主日学校回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This, then, is how I wound up in Skyler Brown's garage, surrounded by high school kids, watching a boa constrictor swallow eggs. Since I'd already seen it down a rat in the Baker brothers' bedroom, Pisser had lost at least some of the element of surprise. Plus, I picked up on the fact that they'd been saving this little show to freak me out, and I really didn't want to give them the satisfaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，这就是我怎样去SkylerBrown的地下室，在一群高中生的围绕下，看一只蟒蛇吞掉鸡蛋。不过我已经见识过它在贝克兄弟的厕所里吃掉一只老鼠，所以这至少去掉了点惊吓的成分。再加上，我认为他们就是想用这个小小的表演来吓我，但我绝对不想给他们任何满足感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This wasn't easy, though, because watching a snake swallow an egg is actually much creepier than you might think. The boa opened its mouth to an enormous size, then just took the egg in and glub! We could see it roll down its throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这并不容易，因为看一只蛇吞下一个鸡蛋事实上比你想象得更令人毛骨悚然。蟒蛇会把嘴巴张得极大，然后咕咚一声吞掉鸡蛋！我们甚至能看见鸡蛋从它的喉咙滚下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd get so nervous going down there that my voice would squeak when I'd tell Lynetta it was time for dinner. It literally squeaked. But after a while the band dropped Mystery from their name, and Pisser and its entourage got used to me showing up. And instead of glaring at me, they started saying stuff like, "Hey, baby brother, come on in!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次我去那里都会非常紧张，当我告诉琳内塔晚饭时间到了的时候我的声音都会颤抖。它确实在颤抖。但是没过多久乐队就把“神秘”二字从他们的名字里去掉了，而贝克兄弟和其他随从的人员也习惯了我的出现。他们不再瞪着我，而是开始对我说话，例如，“嗨，小弟弟，快进来！”">查看中文翻译</div>

You're done.</div>
