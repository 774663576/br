<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音传了出来，出奇地平淡：“不知道，但是没问题。”她遏止住了继续问下去和继续摸着刀刃的冲动。那物件在那儿，他们明白它是什么东西，老碰它只会使丹尼…和她自己感到更害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack had lost his mind. They had sat together on Danny's cot as the storm began to pick up clout and meanness around eight o'clock this morning and had listened to him downstairs, bellowing and stumbling from one place to another. Most of it had seemed to come from the ballroom. Jack singing tuneless bits of song, Jack holding up one side of an argument, Jack screaming loudly at one point, freezing both of their faces as they stared into one another's eyes. Finally they had heard him stumbling back across the lobby, and Wendy thought she had heard a loud banging noise, as if he had fallen down or pushed a door violently open. Since eight thirty or so -- three and a half hours now -- there had been only silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克精神失常了。今天早上八点钟左右暴风雪开始逞威时，他们一起坐在丹尼的小床上，听杰克在楼下咆哮，从一个地方磕磕绊绊地窜到另一个地方，好像大多数声音来自舞厅。杰克断断续续地哼着走调的歌，杰克在跟谁争论，杰克有一会儿厉声尖叫起来，吓得他俩面面相觑、脸无人色。最后，他们听到他跌跌撞撞回到门厅，温迪想，她听到了扑通响了一声，好像是他跌倒了，要不就是他撞开了门。8点半——3个半小时前——之后，楼下一片死寂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She went down the short hall, turned into the main first floor corridor, and went to the stairs. She stood on the first floor landing looking down into the lobby. It appeared deserted, but the gray and snowy day had left much of the long room in shadow. Danny could be wrong. Jack could be behind a chair or couch… maybe behind the registration desk… waiting for her to come down…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在短过道上走去，转弯进入二楼主走廊，然后向楼梯走去。她站在二楼楼梯平台上往门厅里看。门厅显得很荒凉，但是，下雪天光线不好，这个长长的房间的大部分笼罩在阴影里。丹尼可能会出错，杰克也许就藏在椅子或沙发后面…也许在登记台后面…等着她走下楼去…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her hand found the handle of the knife and she began to go down. She had seen the end of her marriage many times, in divorce, in Jack's death at the scene of a drunken car accident (a regular vision in the dark two o'clock of Stovington mornings), and occasionally in daydreams of being discovered by another man, a soap opera Galahad who would sweep Danny and her onto the saddle of his snow -- white charger and take them away. But she had never envisioned herself prowling halls and staircases like a nervous felon, with a knife clasped in one hand to use against Jack.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="（还有那些说话声）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because from time to time it had not seemed that there was a solitary crazy man below them, shouting at and holding conversations with the phantoms in his own crumbling mind. From time to time, like a radio signal fading in and out, she had heard -- or thought she had -- other voices, and music, and laughter. At one moment she would hear Jack holding a conversation with someone named Grady (the name was vaguely familiar to her but she made no actual connection), making statements and asking questions into silence, yet speaking loudly, as if to make himself heard over a steady background racket. And then, eerily, other sounds would be there, seeming to slip into places -- a dance band, people clapping, a man with an amused yet authoritative voice who seemed to be trying to persuade somebody to make a speech. For a period of thirty seconds to a minute she would hear this, long enough to grow faint with terror, and then it would be gone again and she would only hear Jack, talking in that commanding yet slightly slurred way she remembered as his drunk-speak voice. But there was nothing in the hotel to drink except cooking sherry. Wasn't that right? Yes, but if she could imagine that the hotel was full of voices and music, couldn't Jack imagine that he was drunk?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她时不时地觉得，楼下不是单独一个狂人在向他自己稀里糊涂的脑子里的鬼怪们吼叫、在与它们交谈。不时地，就像时断时续的无线电信号，她听到——或以为听到了——另外一些说话声，还有音乐和笑声。有那么一会儿，她仿佛听到杰克在和一个叫格雷迪的人谈话（这个名字她好像很熟悉，但她没有把它跟具体某个人对上号）。他发表声明，问问题，没人理睬，但他仍然大声讲话，好像要在乱轰轰的背景中让自己的声音被听见。接着，稀奇古怪地，另外一些声音又来了，仿佛是从天而降的——舞会乐队，人们在鼓掌，有个人好像在劝某人做演讲，他的声音很快活，但带着命令的口吻。这些声音约莫持续了30秒到1分钟，长得足够把她吓昏过去，接着又消失了。接下来又只剩下杰克的声音，口气专横，吐字略微不清，是她记得的那种酣醉后的声音。可是，饭店里除了料酒外没有什么可喝的。难道不是吗？是的，是这样的，但是，既然她能想像饭店里充满了谈话声和音乐，难道杰克就不能想像他喝醉了吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy reached the lobby and looked around. The velvet rope that had cordoned off the ballroom had been taken down; the steel post it had been clipped to had been knocked over, as if someone had carelessly bumped it going by. Mellow white light fell through the open door onto the lobby rug from the ballroom's high, narrow windows. Heart thumping, she went to the open ballroom doors and looked in. It was empty and silent, the only sound that curious subaural echo that seems to linger in all large rooms, from the largest cathedral to the smallest hometown bingo parlor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪来到门厅，四处看了看。那条把舞厅隔开的天鹅绒绳掉在地上，系绳的钢柱也翻倒了，好像有人过路时不小心绊上了。舞厅高而窄的窗户透进的柔和的白光穿过敞开的门落在了门厅地毯上。她的心脏突突地跳动起来，她来到舞厅门边往里看。里面空荡荡静悄悄的，只有萦绕在所有的大厅——从大教堂到小城镇的赌厅——里的那种奇异的、几乎听不见的回声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went back to the registration desk and stood undecided for a moment, listening to the wind howl outside. It was the worst storm so far, and it was still building up force. Somewhere on the west side a shutter latch had broken and the shutter banged back and forth with a steady flat cracking sound, like a shooting gallery with only one customer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她回到登记台边，犹豫不决地站了一会儿，听着狂风在外面怒号。这是迄今为止最大的雪暴，而且还在积聚力量。西面墙上有一扇百叶窗的销子断了，窗板在风中摔来摔去，接连不断地发出了单调的咔拉咔拉的声音，就像只有一位顾客的射击馆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(Jack, you really should take care of that. Before something gets in.) What would she do if he came at her right now, she wondered. If he should pop up from behind the dark, varnished registration desk with its pile of triplicate forms and its little silver-plated bell, like some murderous jack-in-the-box, pun intended, a grinning jack-in-the-box with a cleaver in one hand and no sense at all left behind his eyes. Would she stand frozen with terror, or was there enough of the primal mother in her to fight him for her son until one of them was dead? She didn't know. The very thought made her sick, made her feel that her whole life had been a long and easy dream to lull her helplessly into this waking nightmare. She was soft. When trouble came, she slept. Her past was unremarkable. She had never been tried in fire. Now the trial was upon her, not fire but ice, and she would not be allowed to sleep through this. Her son was waiting for her upstairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（杰克，你确实应该照管一下这件事。在出大问题之前。）假如他此时向她袭来，她该怎么办呢？她疑惑道。假如他从那张漆黑的明晃晃的登记台——台上摆着一叠一式三份的表格和一只镀银的小铃铛——后面突然窜出来，杀气腾腾，面带狞笑，手里举着一把砍刀，眼睛里看不出丝毫理智，她是否会吓得呆若木鸡？或者说，她是否具备足够的原始母性为她儿子跟他拼个你死我活？她不知道。这种想法使她感到一阵恶心——使她感到她过去的日子有如一个漫长而又轻松的梦，结果却把她无助地诓进了此时这个活生生的梦魇里。她很软弱。麻烦降临的时候，她宁愿酣然而睡。她的过去平淡无奇，她从未经历过血与火的考验。现在考验找到她头上了，不是火而是冰，而且不允许她躺着睡大觉就安然躲过，她儿子在楼上等着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She put the gate up and went through, pausing to glance into the inner office before going in herself. She fumbled through the next door for the bank of kitchen light switches, coldly expecting a hand to close over hers at any second. Then the fluorescents were coming on with minuscule ticking and humming sounds and she could see Mr. Hallorann's kitchen -- her kitchen now, for better or worse -- pale green tiles, gleaming Formica, spotless porcelain, glowing chrome edgings. She had promised him she would keep his kitchen clean, and she had. She felt as if it was one of Danny's safe places. Dick Hallorann's presence seemed to enfold and comfort her. Danny had called for Mr. Hallorann, and upstairs, sitting next to Danny in fear as her husband ranted and raved below, that had seemed like the faintest of all hopes. But standing here, in Mr. Hallorann's place, it seemed almost possible. Perhaps he was on his way now, intent on getting to them regardless of the storm. Perhaps it was so.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny put the bargate up while she folded Jack's hands on his chest and listened to his breathing for a moment. It was slow but regular.

She thought it might be liquor as much as the crack on the head with the bottle that had put him out.</div>

She had been married to him for nearly seven years, he had lain on top of her countless times-in the thousands but she had never realized how heavy he was. Her breath whistled painfully in and out of her hurt throat. Nevertheless, she felt better than she had in days. She was alive. Having just brushed so close to death, that was precious. And Jack was alive, too. By blind luck rather than plan, they had perhaps found the only way that would bring them all safely out.</div>
