<div class="line_en">But one afternoon when she was walking home from Harrod's she chanced to meet Walter Fane in the Brampton Road. He stopped and talked to her. Then, casually, he asked her if she would take a turn with him in the Park. She had no particular wish to go home; it was not just then a very agreeable place. They strolled along, talking as they always talked, of casual things, and he asked her where she was going for the summer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty spoke with her tongue in her cheek, for she knew quite well that her father had not nearly enough work to tire him and even if he had his convenience would never have been consulted in the choice of a holiday. But a quiet place was a cheap place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂的回答不无挖苦，因为她清楚地知道父亲的业务还不至于多到累着他的地步，另外家里也轮不到他来决定休假的目的地。关键在于安静的地方价钱便宜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when they were seated he seemed to grow strangely abstracted. He was an odd creature. She chattered on, however, gaily enough and wondered why he had asked her to walk with him in the Park. Perhaps he was going to confide in her his passion for the flat-footed nurse in Hong Kong. Suddenly he turned to her, interrupting her in the middle of a sentence, so that she could not but see that he had not been listening, and his face was chalk white.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是当他们坐下来以后，他忽然变得怪怪的，似乎心神不宁。她心想他真是一个怪人，不过她依旧兴高采烈地闲聊，心里揣度着他邀请她来公园散步的目的。或许他要倾诉他对香港那位笨蛋护士的爱慕之情？他突然转向她，打断了她刚说了一半的话，原来他根本没在听她说话。他的脸全都煞白了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked at him quickly and she saw that his eyes were filled with a painful anxiety. His voice was strained, low, and not quite steady. But before she could ask herself what this agitation meant he spoke again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她飞快地瞥了他一眼，他的眼神显得焦虑万分，嗓音有点奇怪，低低的，有些发抖。她还没来得及想他因何变得如此激动，他又开口了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He said nothing more. He looked down on the grass sullenly. He was a very odd creature.

His impassivity was vaguely impressive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没再说话，低下头阴沉地望着草地。他真是个怪人，不过既然他表白了，她倒隐隐约约觉得这种爱她的方式还从没碰到过。她受了一点惊吓，但是也很得意。他的淡漠还历历在目呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her heart began to beat a little more quickly. She had been proposed too often before, but gaily or sentimentally, and she had answered in the same fashion. No one had ever asked her to marry him in a manner which was so abrupt and yet strangely tragic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的心脏跳得更快了。她曾遇到无数次的求爱，而他们无一不是和颜悦色、深情款款。她用同一种方式回绝了他们。还没有人像他这样突兀地、甚至痛苦地向她求婚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still he did not say anything. He did not stir. Did he mean to keep her there till she had decided? That was absurd. She must talk it over with her mother. She ought to have got up when she spoke; she had waited, thinking he would answer, and now, she did not know why, she found it difficult to make a movement. She did not look at him, but she was conscious of his apperance; she had never seen herself marrying a man so little taller than herself. When you sat close to him you saw how good his features were, and how cold his face. It was strange when you couldn't help being conscious of the devastating passion which was in his heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还是没有回答，也没有动。他在等着她做出决定吗？那太荒唐了。她必须先和母亲商量。刚才说话的时候她就应该站起来，她坐着只是想等着他的回答。而现在，不知为什么她觉得再想动却动不了了。她没有看他，只在心里回想着他的形象。她做梦也没想过要嫁给一个才比她高那么一点的男人。当你坐在他身边时，你会发现他的容貌相当清秀，同时也会看到他的脸色有多冷淡。而当你意识到他的心里其实涌动着强烈的激情，那种感觉真是怪极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave her a look and she felt her eyes drawn to his. They had a tenderness which she had never seen in them before, but there was something beseeching in them, like a dog's that has been whipped, which slightly exasperated her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将目光转向了她。她觉得她的眼睛不自主地触到了他的目光。他的眼睛里有种她从未见过的柔情，同时似乎在乞求着什么，就像一条狗被鞭子抽了时眼睛里的东西。这加剧了她的紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think I improve on acquaintance," he said. "Of course you're shy, aren't you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that was odd too, for inexplicably enough it touched her; he wasn't really cold, of course, it was his manner that was unfortunate: she liked him at that moment better than she had ever liked him before. Doris was to be married in November. He would be on his way to China then and if she married him she would be with him. It wouldn't be very nice to be a bridesmaid at Doris's wedding. She would be glad to escape that. And then Doris as a married woman and herself single! Everyone knew how young Doris was and it would make her seem older. It would put her on the shelf. It wouldn't be a very good marriage for her, but it was a marriage, and the fact that she would live in China made it easier. She was afraid of her mother's bitter tongue. Why all the girls who had come out with her were married long ago and most of them had children; she was tired of going to see them and gushing over their babies. Walter Fane offered her a new life. She turned to him with a smile which she well knew the effect of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在更怪的事发生了，她竟然有点感动。他当然不是那么冷漠，只不过是他不会交际罢了。现在她比以前任何时候都更喜欢他。多丽丝十一月就要结婚了。那时他也会去中国。要是她嫁给他，那么她就会和他一起去。给多丽丝当伴娘可不太妙，能躲开是最好不过了。要是多丽丝结了婚，而她还是单身，岂不更显出她是个老处女。那时就没人想再答理她了。对她来说嫁给瓦尔特不是十分中意，但是毕竟是一场婚姻。况且中国的生活也很令人向往。她已经受不了妈妈那张冷嘲热讽的嘴了。跟她同岁的姑娘早就都嫁了人，几乎个个连孩子都有了。她再也懒得去探望她们，跟她们谈论她们的心肝宝贝。瓦尔特·费恩会给她带来新的生活。她转向了他，露出了信心十足的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was certainly the oddest proposal she had ever had. And even now it seemed to her that they were saying to one another the last things you would have expected on such an occasion. She was not in the least in love with him. She did not know why she hesitated to refuse him at once.</div>

<div class="line_en">That would save her from spending the summer in a country vicarage, hired at five guineas a week, with her father and mother. In a flash she saw in her mind's eye the announcement in the Morning Post that, the bridegroom having to return to the East, the wedding would take place at once. She knew her mother well enough, she could be counted on to make a splash; for the moment at least Doris would be in the background and when Doris's much grander wedding took place she would be far away.</div>
