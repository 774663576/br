<div class="line_en">The mountain thawed and the Princess appeared on its face, her head brushing the sky. It was Sunday, a month after the accident, and everyone had gathered in the living room. Dad had begun to expound a scripture when Tyler cleared his throat and said he was leaving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山雪融化，印第安公主在山的正面显现，她的头擦着天空。那场车祸一个月后的一个星期天，全家人聚在起居室里。爸爸开始讲解《圣经》时，泰勒清了清嗓子，他说他要离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyler would be the third of my brothers to leave home. My oldest brother, Tony, drove rigs, hauling gravel or scrap, trying to scrape together enough money to marry the girl down the road. Shawn, the next oldest, had quarreled with Dad a few months before and taken off. I hadn't seen him since, though Mother got a hurried call every few weeks telling her he was fine, that he was welding or driving rigs. If Tyler left too, Dad wouldn't have a crew, and without a crew he couldn't build barns or hay sheds. He would have to fall back on scrapping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒将是我的哥哥们中第三个离开家的。我大哥托尼开拖拉机运碎石和废品，正在为娶妻努力攒钱。二哥肖恩几个月前和爸爸吵了一架，离开了家。此后我就没见过他了，但母亲每隔几周会接到他匆忙打来的电话，他在电话里告诉她他很好，正在做焊接或开拖拉机。如果泰勒也走了，爸爸就凑不够一个小工队了，也就没法去给人家盖谷仓或干草棚了。他将不得不重操拆解废料的老本行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother said Dad was wasting his time, that nobody could talk Tyler out of anything once his mind was made up. "You may as well take a broom and start sweeping dirt off the mountain," she said. Then she stood, took a few moments to steady herself, and trudged downstairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲说爸爸是在浪费时间，一旦泰勒下定决心，没人能说服他回转心意。“你这是在用扫帚扫山上的灰。”[6]说着，她站了起来，先花几分钟稳住身体，然后艰难地下楼。【注：[6]意指“不可能的任务，白费口舌”。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He listened to Dad, who settled into a lecture. "There's two kinds of them college professors," Dad said. "Those who know they're lying, and those who think they're telling the truth." Dad grinned. "Don't know which is worse, come to think of it, a bona fide agent of the Illuminati, who at least knows he's on the devil's payroll, or a high-minded professor who thinks his wisdom is greater than God's." He was still grinning. The situation wasn't serious; he just needed to talk some sense into his son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在听爸爸发表长篇大论。“大学教授有两种，”爸爸说，“一种知道自己在说谎，另一种认为自己在说真话。”爸爸咧嘴一笑，“不知道哪种更糟糕，想想看吧，一种是光明会的金牌代理人，至少知道自己拿的是魔鬼的工资，另一种甚是傲慢，自认为比上帝更有智慧。”他依然咧着嘴笑。形势并不严峻；他只需给儿子讲一些道理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么是大学？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"College is extra school for people too dumb to learn the first time around," Dad said. Tyler stared at the floor, his face tense. Then his shoulders dropped, his face relaxed and he looked up; it seemed to me that he'd stepped out of himself. His eyes were soft, pleasant. I couldn't see him in there at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大学就是给那些太过蠢笨、在第一轮学不会的人额外开设的学校。”爸爸说道。泰勒盯着地板，脸孔紧绷。接着他垂下肩膀，面容舒展，抬起了头。在我看来，他的自我似已出离。他的目光柔和又可爱，我完全无法从那眼神中认出他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An hour later Dad was no longer grinning. Tyler had not repeated his wish to go to college, but he had not promised to stay, either. He was just sitting there, behind that vacant expression, riding it out. "A man can't make a living out of books and scraps of paper," Dad said. "You're going to be the head of a family. How can you support a wife and children with books?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时后，爸爸不再咧嘴笑了。泰勒没有再提他上大学的愿望，但也没答应留下来。他只是出神地坐在那里，安然承受。“一个男人不可能靠书本和废纸为生，”爸爸说，“你以后会成为一家之主。你靠书本怎么养活老婆孩子呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had a migraine. She nearly always had a migraine. She was still spending her days in the basement, coming upstairs only after the sun had gone down, and even then she rarely stayed more than an hour before the combination of noise and exertion made her head throb. I watched her slow, careful progress down the steps, her back bent, both hands gripping the rail, as if she were blind and had to feel her way. She waited for both feet to plant solidly on one step before reaching for the next. The swelling in her face was nearly gone, and she almost looked like herself again, except for the rings, which had gradually faded from black to dark purple, and were now a mix of lilac and raisin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她得了偏头痛。她几乎总是偏头痛。她仍然在地下室里度日，直到太阳落山后才上楼，之后也很少能待过一个小时，因为嘈杂和劳累的双重折磨让她头痛欲裂。我看着她慢慢地、小心翼翼地走下楼梯，弯着腰，双手紧抓栏杆，仿佛是个盲人，不得不摸索着前行。她等着双脚都稳稳地站在一个台阶上，然后再去够下一级。她脸上的浮肿差不多消失了，几乎恢复了原来的模样，只是黑眼圈仍在，从黑色逐渐褪成深紫色，现在变成一种紫丁香和葡萄干的混合色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The story of how Tyler decided to leave the mountain is a strange one, full of gaps and twists. It begins with Tyler himself, with the bizarre fact of him. It happens sometimes in families: one child who doesn't fit, whose rhythm is off, whose meter is set to the wrong tune. In our family, that was Tyler. He was waltzing while the rest of us hopped a jig; he was deaf to the raucous music of our lives, and we were deaf to the serene polyphony of his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒是怎么决定离开这座山的，这是个离奇的故事，充满缺口和曲折。故事从泰勒本人开始，他性情古怪，这是事实。这种情况发生在很多家庭里：某个孩子格格不入，跟不上节奏，合不上拍子。在我们家，泰勒就是那个孩子。我们其余人跳吉格舞，而他跳的是华尔兹；他对我们生活中喧闹的音乐充耳不闻，我们也听不见他宁静的复调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I will always remember my father in this moment, the potency of him, and the desperation. He leans forward, jaw set, eyes narrow, searching his son's face for some sign of agreement, some crease of shared conviction. He doesn't find it.</div>

I raised you better than that!"</div>

<div class="line_en">My brothers were like a pack of wolves. They tested each other constantly, with scuffles breaking out every time some young pup hit a growth spurt and dreamed of moving up. When I was young these tussles usually ended with Mother screaming over a broken lamp or vase, but as I got older there were fewer things left to break. Mother said we'd owned a TV once, when I was a baby, until Shawn had put Tyler's head through it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler liked books, he liked quiet. He liked organizing and arranging and labeling. Once, Mother found a whole shelf of matchboxes in his closet, stacked by year. Tyler said they contained his pencil shavings from the past five years, which he had collected to make fire starters for our "head for the hills" bags. The rest of the house was pure confusion: piles of unwashed laundry, oily and black from the junkyard, littered the bedroom floors; in the kitchen, murky jars of tincture lined every table and cabinet, and these were only cleared away to make space for even messier projects, perhaps to skin a deer carcass or strip Cosmoline off a rifle. But in the heart of this chaos, Tyler had half a decade's pencil shavings, cataloged by year.</div>

<div class="line_en">While his brothers wrestled, Tyler listened to music. He owned the only boom box I had ever seen, and next to it he kept a tall stack of CDs with strange words on them, like "Mozart" and "Chopin." One Sunday afternoon, when he was perhaps sixteen, he caught me looking at them. I tried to run, because I thought he might wallop me for being in his room, but instead he took my hand and led me to the stack. "W-which one do y-you like best?" he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兄弟们扭打起来时，泰勒就听音乐。他拥有我所见过的唯一的音箱，音箱旁边放着一大堆CD，上面写着诸如“莫扎特”和“肖邦”之类的奇怪的词。在他大约十六岁时，一个星期天的下午，我正在看他的CD，被他撞上了。我想跑开，我以为他会因我进他的房间而狠狠揍我一顿，但他却拉过我的手，把我领到那堆东西旁。“你…你最…最喜欢哪一张？”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One was black, with a hundred men and women dressed in white on the cover. I pointed to it. Tyler eyed me skeptically. "Th-th-this is ch-ch-choir music," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">He slipped the disc into the black box, then sat at his desk to read. I squatted on the floor by his feet, scratching designs into the carpet. The music began: a breath of strings, then a whisper of voices, chanting, soft as silk, but somehow piercing. The hymn was familiar to me -- we'd sung it at church, a chorus of mismatched voices raised in worship -- but this was different. It was worshipful, but it was also something else, something to do with study, discipline and collaboration. Something I didn't yet understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把碟片塞进黑盒子，然后坐在书桌前开始看书。我蹲在他脚边的地板上，用指甲在地毯上乱画。音乐响起：一阵琴弦的拨动，接着浅吟低唱，如丝绸般轻柔，却不知何故穿透心灵。我熟悉这首赞美诗——我们在教堂唱过，混乱的声音带着虔诚汇聚成大合唱——但这个不同。同样充满虔诚，但里面也有别的东西，与学习、纪律和协作有关。一些我还不懂的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The song ended and I sat, paralyzed, as the next played, and the next, until the CD finished. The room felt lifeless without the music.

It was very late, and the house quiet, when Tyler stood from his desk and pushed play, saying this was the last time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Music became our language. Tyler's speech impediment kept him quiet, made his tongue heavy. Because of that, he and I had never talked much; I had not known my brother. Now, every evening when he came in from the junkyard, I would be waiting for him. After he'd showered, scrubbing the day's grime from his skin, he'd settle in at his desk and say, "W-w-what shall we l-l-listen t-t-to tonight?" Then I would choose a CD, and he would read while I lay on the floor next to his feet, eyes fixed on his socks, and listened.</div>

<div class="line_en">I should have known that one day Tyler would leave. Tony and Shawn had gone, and they'd belonged on the mountain in a way that Tyler never did. Tyler had always loved what Dad called "book learning," which was something the rest of us, with the exception of Richard, were perfectly indifferent to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我早该知道有一天泰勒会离开。托尼和肖恩走了，他们属于这座山，而泰勒从不属于这里。泰勒一直喜欢父亲所说的“书本知识”，而除理查德外，我们其他人对此毫不关心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There had been a time, when Tyler was a boy, when Mother had been idealistic about education. She used to say that we were kept at home so we could get a better education than other kids. But it was only Mother who said that, as Dad thought we should learn more practical skills. When I was very young, that was the battle between them: Mother trying to hold school every morning, and Dad herding the boys into the junkyard the moment her back was turned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒小的时候，曾有一段时间，母亲对教育持理想主义态度。她曾说把我们留在家里，是为了让我们获得比其他孩子更好的教育。但只有母亲这么说，因为爸爸认为我们应该学习更多实用技能。我很小的时候，他们两人常常为此而战：母亲每天早上都让我们学习，她一转身，爸爸就把男孩们赶进废料场干活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Mother would lose that battle, eventually. It began with Luke, the fourth of her five sons. Luke was smart when it came to the mountain -- he worked with animals in a way that made it seem like he was talking to them -- but he had a severe learning disability and struggled to learn to read. Mother spent five years sitting with him at the kitchen table every morning, explaining the same sounds again and again, but by the time he was twelve, it was all Luke could do to cough out a sentence from the Bible during family scripture study. Mother couldn't understand it. She'd had no trouble teaching Tony and Shawn to read, and everyone else had just sort of picked it up. Tony had taught me to read when I was four, to win a bet with Shawn, I think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但母亲最终会输掉这场战斗。一切要从她五个儿子中的第四个，卢克说起。卢克对山上的事很有一套——他对动物很在行，似乎能与它们交流——但他有严重的学习障碍，学习认字非常吃力。母亲花了五年时间，每天早上陪他坐在餐桌边，一遍又一遍地解释同一个音，但到卢克十二岁时，他也只能在全家人习读经文时勉强读出《圣经》中的一句话。母亲不理解。她毫不费力地教会了托尼和肖恩认字，其他人也都轻松地学会了。我四岁时托尼就教我认字，我想那是为了和肖恩打赌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother's conversion to Dad's philosophy was not total, however, and occasionally she was possessed of her old enthusiasm. On those days, when the family was gathered around the table, eating breakfast, Mother would announce that today we were doing school. She kept a bookshelf in the basement, stocked with books on herbalism, along with a few old paperbacks. There were a few textbooks on math, which we shared, and an American history book that I never saw anyone read except Richard. There was also a science book, which must have been for young children because it was filled with glossy illustrations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，母亲并没有完全倒向爸爸的那套理论，她偶尔仍怀有以前的热忱。在那样的日子里，一家人围坐在餐桌旁吃早餐时，母亲会宣布今天我们要“上学”。她在地下室放了一个书架，上面堆满了有关草药学的书和一些旧平装书。其中有几册数学课本供大家共用；一本美国历史书，除了理查德，我从未见其他人读过。还有一本科学书，肯定是幼儿读物，因为里面画满精美的插图。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once Luke could scratch out his name and read short, simple phrases, Mother turned to math. What math I was ever taught I learned doing the breakfast dishes and listening to Mother explain, over and over, what a fraction is or how to use negative numbers. Luke never made any progress, and after a year Mother gave up. She stopped talking about us getting a better education than other kids. She began to echo Dad. "All that really matters," she said to me one morning, "is that you kids learn to read. That other twaddle is just brainwashing." Dad started coming in earlier and earlier to round up the boys until, by the time I was eight, and Tyler sixteen, we'd settled into a routine that omitted school altogether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等卢克会写自己的名字，读一些简短的词语，母亲便开始教他数学。我的数学知识都是在早餐后洗碗时学到的，听母亲一遍又一遍地解释什么是分数，怎么运用负数。卢克没有取得任何进展，一年后母亲便放弃了。她不再说什么让我们获得更好的教育，而是开始附和爸爸的意见。一天早上，她对我说：“最重要的是，你们这些孩子都能认字了。其他的都是废话，洗脑而已。”爸爸越来越早地赶着男孩们去干活，到我八岁、泰勒十六岁时，我们就都彻底不学习了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler stayed in school that whole year, from the fall of 1991 through the spring of 1992. He learned algebra, which felt as natural to his mind as air to his lungs. Then the Weavers came under siege that August. I don't know if Tyler would have gone back to school, but I know that after Dad heard about the Weavers, he never again allowed one of his children to set foot in a public classroom. Still, Tyler's imagination had been captured. With what money he had he bought an old trigonometry textbook and continued to study on his own. He wanted to learn calculus next but couldn't afford another book, so he went to the school and asked the math teacher for one. The teacher laughed in his face. "You can't teach yourself calculus," he said. "It's impossible." Tyler pushed back. "Give me a book, I think I can." He left with the book tucked under his arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">One lunch in particular has lodged in my memory. Tyler is assembling tacos from the fixings Mother has laid out: he lines up the shells on his plate, three in a perfect row, then adds the hamburger, lettuce and tomatoes carefully, measuring the amounts, perfectly distributing the sour cream. Dad drones steadily. Then, just as Dad reaches the end of his lecture and takes a breath to begin again, Tyler slides all three of the flawless tacos into Mother's juicer, the one she uses to make tinctures, and turns it on. A loud roar howls through the kitchen, imposing a kind of silence. The roar ceases; Dad resumes. Tyler pours the orange liquid into a glass and begins to drink, carefully, delicately, because his front teeth are still loose, still trying to jump out of his mouth. Many memories might be summoned to symbolize this period of our lives, but this is the one that has stayed with me: of Dad's voice rising up from the floor while Tyler drinks his tacos.</div>

I took in the pearly sink, the rosy tint of the carpet, the peach-colored rug. Even the toilet peeked out from under a primrose covering. I took in my own reflection, framed by creamy tiles. I looked nothing like myself, and I wondered for a moment if this was what Tyler wanted, a pretty house with a pretty bathroom and a pretty sister to visit him. Maybe this was what he'd left for. I hated him for that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆把第一批饼干放进烤箱后，我去了趟卫生间。穿过铺着柔软的白色地毯的走廊，我想起上次看到它时还和泰勒一起，心中不免一阵愤怒。卫生间感觉陌生。闪着珍珠般光泽的水槽，玫瑰般绚丽的大地毯，桃粉色的小地毯全都映入眼帘。甚至樱草花盖子下的马桶都在向外窥视。我从镶有乳白色瓷砖框的镜中看着自己。我看上去一点也不像我自己了。有那么一刻，我在想难道这就是泰勒想要的：漂亮的房子，漂亮的卫生间，漂亮的妹妹。也许他离开就是为了这个。想到这里我就对他心生怨恨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was spending the afternoon with Grandma-over-in-town. I'd had a bath that morning, even though it wasn't Sunday, and I'd put on special clothes with no holes or stains so that, scrubbed and polished, I could sit in Grandma's kitchen and watch her make pumpkin cookies. The autumn sun poured in through gossamer curtains and onto marigold tiles, giving the whole room an amber glow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，我和城里外婆在一起。那天虽然不是星期天，早上我还是洗了个澡，特意穿上没有破洞和污渍的衣服，这样我就可以干净得体地坐在外婆的厨房里，看她做南瓜饼干了。秋日的阳光透过薄纱窗帘洒在金盏花瓷砖上，让整个房间发出琥珀色的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Near the tap there were a dozen pink and white soaps, shaped like swans and roses, resting in an ivory-tinted shell. I picked up a swan, feeling its soft shape give under pressure from my fingers. It was beautiful and I wanted to take it. I pictured it in our basement bathroom, its delicate wings set against the coarse cement. I imagined it lying in a muddy puddle on the sink, surrounded by strips of curling yellowed wallpaper. I returned it to its shell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水龙头附近摆着十几块粉色和白色香皂，玫瑰和天鹅形状，放在象牙色的贝壳皂盒里。我拿起一块天鹅形状的，放在手指间细细感受它的柔软。真美呀，我真想把它带走。我想象把它放在我们家地下室的卫生间里，它那精致的翅膀贴在粗糙的水泥上；我想象它躺在水槽上的泥坑里，周围是一块块发黄打卷的墙纸。我又把它放回了贝壳皂盒里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I squared my stance, ready to argue, to tell Grandma again that we didn't use soap, but when I looked up, the woman I saw was not the woman I expected to see. She didn't seem frivolous, didn't seem like the type who'd waste an entire day fretting over her white carpet. In that moment she was transformed. Maybe it was something in the shape of her eyes, the way they squinted at me in disbelief, or maybe it was the hard line of her mouth, which was clamped shut, determined. Or maybe it was nothing at all, just the same old woman looking like herself and saying the things she always said. Maybe her transformation was merely a temporary shift in my perspective -- for that moment, perhaps the perspective was his, that of the brother I hated, and loved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我摆好姿态，准备争辩，想再次告诉外婆我们不用香皂，但我抬起头，看到的却不是我期待看见的那个女人。她看上去并不“轻佻”，也不像那种整天为白地毯而烦恼的人。那一刻，她变了。也许是她眼睛的形状，它们眯在一起难以置信地看着我，又或者是她线条生硬紧闭的嘴巴。或者可能根本没什么变化，还是那个老太太，还是那副模样，说的也是她常说的话。也许她的转变只是我观感的一时改变——就那一刻而言，也许那是他的观感，那个令我既恨又爱的哥哥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad picked me up soon after on his way home from a job. He pulled up in his truck and honked for me to come out, which I did, my head bent low. Grandma followed. I rushed into the passenger seat, displacing a toolbox and welding gloves, while Grandma told Dad about my not washing. Dad listened, sucking on his cheeks while his right hand fiddled with the gearshift. A laugh was bubbling up inside him.</div>
