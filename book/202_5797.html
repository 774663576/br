<div class="line_en">Their plans were made, their preparations complete; in the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry could not help but remember how Hermione had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利忍不住想起赫敏当初怎样驳斥他对黑刺李木魔杖的嫌恶，当他认为那根魔杖不如自己的好用时，她坚持认为那只是心理作用，对他说只要多加练习。然而哈利决定不再重提她当初的建议，在偷袭古灵阁的前夜跟她作对似乎不是时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I miss my wand," Hermione said miserably. "I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too."</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor's sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利没有想到这一点。他低头看着魔杖，有一种强烈的冲动想把它折断，想用靠在身旁墙上的格兰芬多宝剑把它砍成两截。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione's had done.

<div class="line_en">The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once: He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, "We've just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We've told Bill and Fleur we're leaving tomorrow, and we've told them not to get up to see us off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卧室的门开了，拉环走了进来。哈利本能地伸手抓住剑柄，把宝剑揽到自己的身边，但马上又后悔了：他能看出妖精注意到了这个动作。为了掩饰刚才的尴尬，哈利说：“我们正在做最后的检查，拉环。我们已经告诉比尔和芙蓉我们明天离开，并且叫他们不要起床送我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkins's old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为他们离开之前赫敏要化装成贝拉特里克斯，而让比尔和芙蓉知道的或猜到的越少越好，所以哈利等坚决不要他们送，并讲明了不再返回这里。珀金斯的旧帐篷在遭遇搜捕队的那天晚上弄丢了，比尔又借给他们一个，现在就放在串珠小包里。赫敏那天居然是把小包塞进袜子里才躲过了搜捕队的搜查，哈利得知后十分佩服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor's sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time: "He could give my mother lessons," growled Ron, as the goblin's long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill's warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than "We'll just have to wing it, mate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管哈利会想念比尔、芙蓉、卢娜以及迪安，更不必说这几个星期来享受的家的舒适，但他仍然期待着逃离贝壳小屋的禁锢。他已经厌倦了总要确保他和罗恩、赫敏说话时不会被别人听见，厌倦了把他们自己关在狭小黑暗的卧室里。尤其是他想摆脱拉环。然而，在不交出格兰芬多宝剑的情况下，怎样以及什么时候才能与那个妖精分手，哈利一直想不出答案。那妖精很少让哈利、罗恩和赫敏单独待在一起五分钟以上，他们三人不可能商量出办法。“他都可以给我妈妈上上课了。”罗恩埋怨道，因为妖精的长手指不停地出现在门边。有比尔的警告在脑海里，哈利不禁怀疑拉环随时都在提防他们使诈。赫敏强烈反对计划中的骗局，以至于哈利放弃了同她商量如何完成它。而难得几次没有拉环的自由时间里，罗恩所能想到的也就是：“我们见机行事吧，伙计。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个晚上哈利睡得很糟糕。开始几小时一直醒着，回想起潜入魔法部之前那天晚上的感受。记得当时他是满怀决心，几乎是兴奋的，而现在他却感到一阵阵焦虑和痛苦的怀疑，摆脱不掉对于彻底失败的恐惧。他不停地告诉自己计划很周密，对可能遭遇的所有困难都做了充分准备，而且拉环很熟悉情况。可是他心里仍然不踏实，有一两次听到罗恩有动静，他断定罗恩也醒着，但他们是和迪安一起睡在起居室里，所以哈利没有说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a relief when six o'clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢天谢地，六点钟到了，他们钻出睡袋，在昏暗中穿上衣服，轻手轻脚地走到花园里，等待同赫敏和拉环会合。黎明很寒冷，但由于是五月了，没有什么风。哈利抬头看着仍在黑色夜空中闪烁着微光的星星，听着海水一遍遍冲击着峭壁——他将会怀念这声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix's low voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉特里克斯·莱斯特兰奇大步跨过草坪朝他们走来，拉环陪在旁边。她穿着一件从格里莫广场带来的旧袍子，边走边把串珠小包塞进袍子里面的口袋。哈利尽管明知道那其实是赫敏，却仍然抑制不住一阵厌恶的战栗。她的个头比他还高，长长的波浪形黑发披在背后，肿眼皮的眼睛轻蔑地看着他。但她说话时，哈利从贝拉特里克斯低沉的声音中听出了赫敏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby's grave now; in a year's time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf 's name had already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, through which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore's eye. Then the sound of a door opening made him look around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，绿色的小嫩芽已经从多比坟上的红土中钻出，一年之后这个土丘将被鲜花覆盖。刻有多比名字的白石头已经有点风化的痕迹。他现在才意识到，再也找不到一个比这里更美丽的地方让多比安息了。然而，想到就要离开多比，哈利悲伤得有点心痛。他低头看着坟墓，再次疑惑小精灵是怎么知道去哪里营救他们的。他的手指不经意间伸向挂在脖子上的小皮袋，摸到了边缘不齐的镜子碎片，他曾相信在里面见到了邓布利多的眼睛。这时，开门声一响，他回过头来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伪装过的罗恩还能勉强辨识出来，但哈利想那仅仅是因为他和罗恩太熟悉了。罗恩现在头发长而拳曲，下巴上有一把浓密的棕色胡须，上唇也留着小胡子，脸上没有了雀斑，眉毛很浓，鼻子又短又宽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏叹了口气，开始工作，嘴里喃喃地念着，帮罗恩改变容貌。他被赋予了一个完全是捏造的身份，他们指望贝拉特里克斯那股邪恶的霸气会保护他。哈利和拉环将藏在隐形衣下面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked in front of Harry's throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利弯下腰，妖精爬到他背上，双手相扣抱住哈利的喉咙口。他并不重，但哈利不喜欢碰到妖精，也不喜欢他那样紧抱着自己，力气大得惊人。赫敏从串珠小包里取出隐形衣盖住了他俩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows.</div>

Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn's existence.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry's own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words undesirable number one.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermione drew out Bellatrix's wand and tapped a brick in the nondesCRIpt wall in front of them.

<div class="line_en">With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix's wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it --</div>

<div class="line_en">They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, "No!" but there was no braking: They zoomed through it. Water filled Harry's eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast's scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground; its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway.</div>

The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures -- some with long spines, others with drooping wings -- potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Get it!" Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. "Where's the sword? It had the cup on it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抓住它！”哈利忍着滚烫的金属接触皮肤的灼痛大喊道，而拉环再次爬到他背上，一心躲避着越涨越高的炽热物体，“宝剑在哪儿？上面挂着金杯呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然传来一声最恐怖的尖叫，哈利低头看去：罗恩和赫敏站在齐腰深的财宝中，努力拽着鲍格罗德不让他整个儿陷进去，但是拉环已经被淹得看不见了，只剩一点手指尖露在外面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word.

<div class="line_en">The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword's blade, was flung into the air. The goblin still astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into the outer chamber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="剑上挑着的小金杯被抛向了空中，但那妖精仍然骑在哈利身上。哈利向下猛扑抓到了金杯，尽管感觉到皮肉被它烫伤了，尽管无数的赫奇帕奇金杯从他手中迸出，像雨点一样砸在他身上，他都没有松手。就在这时，金库的门打开了，哈利发现自己无法控制地滑行在炽热的金银的洪流上，与罗恩、赫敏一起被冲到了金库的外面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry's shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, "Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!" He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利几乎没意识到全身烧伤的灼痛，一边随着那些不停复制的财宝往外冲，一边把小金杯塞进口袋，伸手要拿回宝剑，但是拉环不见了。他一找到机会就从哈利背上溜了下去，撒腿逃向周围的妖精中间，挥舞着宝剑叫喊道：“有贼！有贼！救命啊！有贼！”他转眼消失在涌上前来的妖精群里，他们都手持短剑，毫无异议地接纳了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stupefy!" he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“昏昏倒地！”他大吼道，罗恩和赫敏也大吼起来。一道道红光飞入妖精群中，有些妖精栽倒了，但其余的继续前进，哈利还看到好几个巫师警卫从拐角处跑了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, "Relashio!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="被拴住的巨龙一声怒吼，一股火焰从妖精头上飞过，巫师们弯着身子退了回去。哈利突然来了灵感，或者说产生了一个疯狂的念头。他举起魔杖对着巨兽厚重的脚镣大喊一声：“力松劲泄！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry's foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him.

<div class="line_en">"We'll never get out, it's too big!" Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry's eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon's roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, "Defodio!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们根本出不去，它太大了！”赫敏尖叫道，但是巨龙张开大嘴喷出火焰，炸开了隧洞，洞顶碎裂坍塌了。巨龙使用蛮力抓刨着，一路往外冲去。哈利紧闭双眼避开灰尘和热浪，石头的爆裂声和巨龙的吼叫声震耳欲聋。他只能紧紧抓住龙背，担心随时会被甩下去。正在这时，他听见赫敏大喊道：“掘进三尺！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声怒吼，巨龙立了起来，张开翅膀，升向空中。哈利夹紧膝盖，死命地牢牢抓住锯齿状的龙鳞，尖叫着的妖精们像保龄球瓶一样被撞倒在一边。巨龙向甬道出口冲去，哈利、罗恩和赫敏趴在龙背上，身子擦到了甬道顶。追赶的妖精们纷纷向巨龙投掷短剑，一把把短剑擦着它的身体掠过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon's thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon's fire kept their progress clear --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在帮助巨龙扩大通道，挖开洞顶，让它冲向上面新鲜的空气，离开那些尖叫着的丁当作响的妖精们。哈利和罗恩也学着她，用更多的挖掘咒来炸开洞顶。他们经过了地下湖，缓缓前进的巨龙咆哮着，似乎感觉到了自由和前方的空间，而他们身后的甬道里被巨龙那扫动的带尖刺的尾巴、大堆的石块以及碎裂的巨大钟乳石塞得满满的。妖精们发出的丁当声似乎减弱了，而在前方，巨龙的火焰为他们扫清了道路——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon's brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，靠着巨龙的蛮力和咒语的作用，他们炸开甬道进入了大理石门厅，妖精和巫师们尖叫着奔逃躲藏。巨龙终于找到了可以展翅的空间，它有角的脑袋转向门口，闻到了外面凉爽的空气。它迈步而出，用力挤出金属门，哈利、罗恩和赫敏仍然紧紧抓着它的后背。变了形的门在铰链上摇摇晃晃，巨龙蹒跚着走进了对角巷，然后腾空而起。">查看中文翻译</div>
