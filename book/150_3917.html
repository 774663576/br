<div class="line_en">She saw Waddington every day, for he strolled up the hill to the Fanes' bungalow when his day's work was done; and so after a week they had arrived at an intimacy which under other circumstances they could scarcely have achieved in a year. Once when Kitty told him she didn't know what she would do there without him he answered, laughing:</div>

<div class="line_en">Though she gave a careless laugh she wondered what he meant. She felt that his merry little blue eyes were scanning her face with an amiable but disconcerting attention. She had discovered already that he was shrewd and she had a feeling that the relations between herself and Walter excited his cynical curiosity. She found a certain amusement in baffling him. She liked him and she knew that he was kindly disposed towards her. He was not witty nor brilliant, but he had a dry and incisive way of putting things which was diverting, and his funny, boyish face under that bald skull, all screwed up with laughter, made his remarks sometimes extremely droll. He had lived for many years in outposts, often with no man of his own colour to talk to, and his personality had developed in eccentric freedom. He was full of fads and oddities. His frankness was refreshing. He seemed to look upon life in a spirit of banter, and his ridicule of the Colony at Hong Kong was acid; but he laughed also at the Chinese officials in Mei-Tan-Fu and at the cholera which decimated the city. He could not tell a tragic story or one of heroism without making it faintly absurd. He had many anecdotes of his adventures during twenty years in China, and you concluded from them that the earth was a very grotesque, bizarre, and ludicrous place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没听透这话的意思，但还是轻描淡写地附和着笑了一声。她感觉到他那双快活的蓝眼睛在她的脸上搜索着什么，虽然他的态度是和蔼可亲的，但还是叫她有点不安。她早就发现他这个人头脑非常精明，恐怕对她和瓦尔特的关系已经有所洞察，想来探个究竟。她平常老是靠为难他取乐，她喜欢他，知道他坦率直白，不藏什么心机。虽然他不是智慧非凡或者才华出众，不过他看事情总是一针见血，并能用妙趣横生的话做以总结。而每当他发表意见时，他秃顶之下那张孩子气的脸必然花样频出，同时哈哈大笑，时常令她忍俊不禁。他一直在港口做事，几乎很少能和同一肤色的人走动，这也使他的性情颇为通达随性。他钟情于时髦货，另有不少的怪癖。他的率真叫你如沐春风。对他来说，生活的意义似乎就在于玩世不恭。他对香港上流社会的揶揄几近尖刻，对湄潭府的中国官员也少不了奚落挖苦，甚至这城里的霍乱都成了他笑谈的对象。即便是悲剧故事或者英雄传奇，到了他的嘴里也变成了荒诞不经的笑料。他在中国待了二十年，肚子里的奇闻轶事应有尽有，讲也讲不完。从这些人生见闻你可以断言，这个世界纯粹是一个充满了诡异、怪诞、荒唐的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though he denied that he was a Chinese scholar (he swore that the Sinologues were as mad as march hares) he spoke the language with ease. He read little and what he knew he had learned from conversation. But he often told Kitty stories from the Chinese novels and from Chinese history and though he told them with that airy badinage which was natural to him it was good- humoured and even tender. It seemed to her that, perhaps unconsciously, he had adopted the Chinese view that the Europeans were barbarians and their life a folly: in China alone was it so led that a sensible man might discern in it a sort of reality. Here was food for reflexion: Kitty had never heard the Chinese spoken of as anything but decadent, dirty, and unspeakable. It was as though the corner of a curtain were lifted for a moment, and she caught a glimpse of a world rich with a colour and significance she had not dreamt of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他否认自己是中国专家（他断言那群汉学家们简直像发情的兔子一样疯了），但是却能讲一口流利的中国话。他极少读书，了解什么东西全靠跟别人攀谈。但是他的嘴里经常冒出中国小说和中国历史里的故事，尽管这时他的口气也难免戏谑，但却逸趣迭出，讲得十分动人。她或许是下意识地觉得，他已经站到了中国人的一边，认为在欧洲生活的是一群野蛮人，他们的生活是一出出的滑稽闹剧。这一鲜明的观点在中国广为宣扬，以至于任何一个头脑健全的人都能信誓旦旦说出个一二来。然而他的故事是颇令她回味的。在此之前她从中国人那里听来的全是颓唐、龌龊乃至不堪入耳的话。这就如同他为她掀起了帘幕的一角，瞬时她目睹了一个梦中难以见到的恢宏的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She began to eat it coolly. She was seized with she knew not what spirit of bravado. She watched Walter with mocking eyes. She thought that he grew a trifle pale, but when the salad was handed to him he helped himself. The cook, finding they did not refuse it, sent them some in every day and every day, courting death, they ate it. It was grotesque to take such a risk. Kitty, in terror of the disease, took it with the feeling not only that she was thus maliciously avenging herself on Walter, but that she was flouting her own desperate fears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开始潇洒地大吃特吃起来。她显然是在故意逞能，而自己还不自知。她用挑衅的眼光盯着瓦尔特，以为他面色发白，已经怕了。然而当沙拉端到他的面前时，他也张口就吃。厨子发现这道菜颇受欢迎，便每顿必做。而他们争相寻死，都毫不犹豫地享用。凯蒂的用心是复杂的，一方面她要借此向瓦尔特报复，另一方面她也是在嘲笑自己心中的恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
