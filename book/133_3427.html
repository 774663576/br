There's just something about having everyone agree on something -- something about you -- that opens a cage of butterflies in your stomach.

When I watched her give speeches during class, I had no idea what words came out of her mouth. I just watched those lips move up and down. Mesmerized when she said things like "slippery slope," which, behind her lips, exposed the underside of her tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到排名榜出笼之后我才留意到安吉拉·罗麦洛的嘴唇。可自那以后，她的双唇就让我着迷。每次她上课作演讲时，我根本不知道她在说什么。我只是看着那两片嘴唇动来动去。每当她说“滑溜溜的坡道”这类词时，我完全就被迷住，因为透过她张开的双唇可以看到她的舌根。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You know, I'm not even going to interpret this. I'm just going to tell you why it pissed me off. I've had my butt grabbed before -- no big deal -- but this time it was grabbed because someone else wrote my name on a list. And when this guy saw me upset, did he apologize? No. Instead, he got aggressive. Then, in the most condescending way, he told me to relax. Then he put his hand on my shoulder, as if by touching me he'd somehow comfort me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="知道吗，我都不想来诠释这事。我只是想告诉你们，这事为什么让我愤怒。以前也有人抓过我屁股——没什么大不了——但这次有人抓我屁股是因为有人把我列入一个名单上。当这人看到我不开心时，有没有道歉？没有。相反，他行为放肆。然后，他竟然用这种高高在上的傲慢口气让我别生气。接着他又把手搁在我肩头，似乎这么碰着我他就可以安慰我了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later on, Angela and I made out on her back porch. I just couldn't get enough of those lips.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of Angela was nowhere near as mesmerizing as her lips. Not bad, just not mesmerizing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, last summer at a friend's house, we played spin the bottle after a bunch of us admitted we were spin-the-bottle virgins. And I refused to let the game end till my spin landed on Angela. Or till her spin landed on me. When that happened, I pressed my lips, agonizingly slowly and precisely, against hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，去年暑假，在一个朋友家，我们都说自己从没玩过转瓶子游戏，于是就开始玩这个游戏。我不同意结束游戏，直到我的瓶子转到安吉拉身边。或者说她的瓶子转到我这儿。结果，我是慢慢地准确地把自己的嘴唇贴到她的嘴唇上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here's a tip. If you touch a girl, even as a joke, and she pushes you off, leave… her… alone. Don't touch her. Anywhere! Just stop. Your touch does nothing but sicken her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="给你们个小贴士。要是你们碰一个女生，哪怕只是开玩笑，而她把你推开，放——开——她。别碰她。无论哪个部位。且住手。你的碰触只会让她觉得恶心。">查看中文翻译</div>
