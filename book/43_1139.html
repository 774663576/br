<div class="line_en">Meg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe, and Jo began to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That boy is suffering for society and fun," she said to herself. "His grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young and lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!" The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of 'going over' was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try what could be done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took a survey. All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个小伙子没有朋友，没有欢乐，”她心里说，”他爷爷不知道他需要什么，总是把他孤零零地关在屋里。其实他很需要一班快乐的小伙子来陪他玩，需要活泼有朝气的年青人作伴。我真想走过去把这些话告诉那位老绅士！”想到这里乔乐了，她是个有胆识的姑娘，常常做出一些出奇不意的事情，令梅格震惊不已。“走过去”这个计划一直在乔的脑海里纠缠；这天下午雪花飘落时，乔决定采取行动。她看到劳伦斯先生坐车出了门，便开始挖路，一直挖到树篱边，这才停下来望望。四处悄无声息——楼下窗户帘幕低垂，佣人也全无踪影，独见楼上窗边露出一个黑色鬈发的脑袋靠在纤薄的手掌上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在富有想像力的乔眼里，这栋富丽的楼房就像是一座幻想中的宫殿，流光溢彩，富丽堂皇，但却无人欣赏。她早就想看看里头究竟藏着什么宝物，并结识那位“劳伦斯家的男孩”。他看来也有意想交个朋友，只是不知从何做起。自从那次晚会之后，她这种愿望尤其强烈，心里盘算了许多与他交朋友的方法；但最近他却很少露面，乔正以为他出了远门，一天却突然发现楼上一扇窗边露出一个脸孔，若有所思地往下望着她们的花园，花园里贝思和艾美正在一起玩雪球。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="乔抛出一捧软绵绵的雪花，楼上的人马上转过头来，脸上无精打采的神情一扫而光，大眼睛闪闪发亮，嘴角露出笑意。乔点点头笑了，挥舞着手中的扫帚叫道——“你好吗？是不是病了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come." With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was 'a little gentleman', and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color, and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, than a decided voice, asking for 'Mr. Laurie', and a surprised-looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不文静，也并非什么好女孩，但如果妈妈允许的话，我就过来。我去问问她。你乖乖关上窗子，我一会就来。”言毕，乔肩扛扫帚走进屋里，一面思忖大家会怎么说。劳里想到将有人作伴，欣喜不已，四处奔忙做准备；正如马奇太太所说，他是个“小绅士”，为对客人的光临表示敬意，他把卷曲的头发梳理一遍，换上一条干净领带，并试着整理房间，虽说有六个佣人，房间仍然零乱不堪。一会，铃声大响，一个沉着的声音请求见“劳里先生”，一位满脸疑云的佣人跑上楼来，对劳里说有一位小姐求见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know us," began Jo, then laughed and stopped.</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo," said Laurie, going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three kittens in the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了，把她带上来，那是乔小姐，”劳里边说边走到他的小客厅门前迎接乔。乔走进来，脸色绯红，亲切可人，一手着个盖着盖的碟子，一手捧着贝思的三只小猫，神态相当自如。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable at once.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here I am, bag and baggage," she said briskly. "Mother sent her love, and was glad if I could do anything for you.

I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't refuse, she was so anxious to do something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来了，带着全部家当，”她爽快地说，”妈妈谨致爱意，若我能为你效劳的话，她深感高兴。梅格要我送上她做的牛奶冻，她做得好极了。贝思认为她的小猫咪可以安慰你。我知道你一定会取笑它们，但我不能拒绝，她是这么想帮助别人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That looks too pretty to eat," he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“做得太精美了，叫人舍不得吃。”看着乔揭开碟子上的盖儿，露出牛奶冻，里面围着一圈绿叶和艾美最喜爱的绛红色天竺葵花朵，他快乐地笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It's so simple you can eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat. What a cozy room this is!"</div>

<div class="line_en">And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully…"How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真的一切妥当；因为谈笑之间，乔已经把东西收拾得有条不紊，并给房间带来一种特别的气氛。劳里恭敬地默默注视着她，当她示意他坐到沙发上时，他坐下来满意地舒了一口气，感激地说道——“你心地真好！房间是需要这么收拾一下。现在请坐到这张大椅子上，让我为我的客人效劳点什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket?" asked Laurie with interest.</div>

Now then, you're fixed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我两分钟就可以把它弄妥，其实只需要扫扫壁炉地面，这么着——把壁炉台上的东西竖起来，这么着——书放在这边，瓶子放那边，你的沙发不要直对光线，枕头鼓满一点。行了，一切妥当。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你是怎么知道的？”劳里红了脸，不过还是坦白回答：“嗯，你知道，我常听到你们叫唤对方，当我在楼上孤零零一个人时，就忍不住望向你们的屋子，你们似乎总是玩得很开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are.

And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="请原谅我这样无礼，但有时你们忘记放下摆着鲜花的那扇窗户的帘子，灯亮时简直就像是看一幅画，炉火下你们和母亲绕桌而坐，她的脸刚好对着我，在鲜花的掩映下显得异常甜美，我忍不住要看。我没有妈妈，你知道。”劳里的嘴唇忍不住轻轻抽搐了一下，他捅捅炉火借以掩饰。">查看中文翻译</div>

She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said…"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would dance.

For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal.

<div class="line_en">"She's right, the lad is lonely. I'll see what these little girls can do for him," thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她说得对，小伙子是太孤单。我倒要看看这小姑娘能为他做什么，”劳伦斯先生一面看他们说话一面想。他喜欢乔，因为她与众不同，她那古怪、率直的方式很合自己的性格，而且她似乎非常理解这孩子，简直好像是他身上的一分子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full.

Her respect and regard for the 'Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue. "That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well in more important things. Going? well, I'm much obliged to you, and I hope you'll come again.

<div class="line_en">"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he 'glowered' as Jo said."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这我不是很清楚，但我想是因为他的儿子，劳里的父亲娶了位意大利女子——一个音乐家，这事令自尊心极强的老人很不愉快。其实那个女子贤淑可爱，而且多才多艺，但他不喜欢她，他们婚后他便没有再见儿子。劳里还很小的时候，他们便去世了，爷爷把他接回家。那男孩在意大利出生，身子骨不大壮实，我想老人是害怕失去他，因此格外小心。劳里像他母亲，天生热爱音乐。我敢说他爸爸害怕他有当音乐家的念头。不论怎样，他的琴艺使老人想起了自己不喜欢的那个女人，所以他‘怒目而视’，就像乔说的那样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
