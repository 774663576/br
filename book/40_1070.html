<div class="line_en">Some nights, Laila awakens and finds him on the edge of their bed, rocking, his undershirt pulled over his head. The headaches began in Nasir Bagh, he says, then worsened in prison. Sometimes they make him vomit, blind him in one eye. He says it feels like a butcher's knife burrowing in one temple, twisting slowly through his brain, then poking out the other side.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes Laila wets a cloth and lays it on his forehead and that helps a little. The little round white pills Sayeed's doctor gave Tariq help too. But some nights, all Tariq can do is hold his head and moan, his eyes bloodshot, his nose dripping. Laila sits with him when he's in the grip of it like that, rubs the back of his neck, takes his hand in hers, the metal of his wedding band cold against her palm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉有时会浸湿一块布，把它放在他的额头上，这样会让他感觉好一些。萨伊德的医生给塔里克开的药片也有助于缓解头痛。但在某些夜晚，塔里克只能抱着脑袋呻吟，眼睛充满血丝，鼻涕直流。当头痛如此折磨他的时候，莱拉会坐在他身边，按摩他的脖子，抓住他的手，手掌感受到他那冰凉的结婚戒指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He would not have to broach with Tariq the delicate matter of an unmarried couple living in his hotel. Sayeed is not at all as Laila had pictured him, ruddy-faced and pea-eyed.

He is a soft-spoken, mannerly man, with measured speech and graceful movements.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将不用跟塔里克讨论一对未婚男女在他的酒店同居会给他带来什么麻烦。莱拉曾想像萨伊德是个脸色红润、眼睛细小的男人，但他的长相与此完全两样。他留了两撇灰白的八字胡，胡子的两端朝上翘，被他修剪得尖尖的。他一头灰白的长发向后梳起，露出整个额头。他很有礼貌，声音轻柔，说话很有分寸，举动从容不迫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Sayeed who summoned a friend and a mullah for the nikka that day, Sayeed who pulled Tariq aside and gave him money. Tariq wouldn't take it, but Sayeed insisted. Tariq went to the Mall then and came back with two simple, thin wedding bands. They married later that night, after the children had gone to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结婚那天，萨伊德请来了一个朋友和一位毛拉；他还把塔里克拉到旁边，塞给他一笔钱。塔里克谢绝他的好意，但萨伊德执意要他收下。塔里克走到摩尔街上，买回来两个薄而简单的结婚戒指。那天晚上，等到两个孩子睡觉之后，他们完了婚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the mirror, beneath the green veil that the mullah draped over their heads, Laila's eyes met Tariq's. There were no tears, no wedding-day smiles, no whispered oaths of long-lasting love. In silence, Laila looked at their reflection, at faces that had aged beyond their years, at the pouches and lines and sags that now marked their once-scrubbed, youthful faces. Tariq opened his mouth and began to say something, but, just as he did, someone pulled the veil, and Laila missed what it was that he was going to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在镜子中，在毛拉披在他们头上的绿色纱巾之下，莱拉和塔里克两人的目光相遇。没有泪花，没有喜庆的微笑，也没有低声说出的山盟海誓。莱拉默默地看着他们在镜子中的模样，看着两张早衰的脸，他们曾经年轻光滑的脸庞如今皮肤松弛，长着皱纹和眼袋。塔里克张开嘴巴，似乎想说点什么，但就在此时，有人抽走了那条纱巾，莱拉错过了他打算说出口的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night, they lay in bed as husband and wife, as the children snored below them on sleeping cots. Laila remembered the ease with which they would crowd the air between them with words, she and Tariq, when they were younger, the haywire, brisk flow of their speech, always interrupting each other, tugging each other's collar to emphasize a point, the quickness to laugh, the eagerness to delight. So much had happened since those childhood days, so much that needed to be said. But that first night the enormity of it all stole the words from her. That night, it was blessing enough to be beside him. It was blessing enough to know that he was here, to feel the warmth of him next to her, to lie with him, their heads touching, his right hand laced in her left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，他们以丈夫和妻子的身份躺在床上，两个孩子在地上的床铺呼呼睡着。莱拉记得年轻时他们相处的情景，当时塔里克和她总是轻松自如地交谈，漫无边际地闲聊，不时打断对方的话头，为了强调某句话而揪着对方的衣领，乐此不疲地开玩笑，发出欢快的笑声。自童年的那些日子以来，他们之间发生了这么多事情，有这么多要说的话。但第一夜，巨大的幸福感却让她一个字也说不出来。那一夜，能够在他身边已经足够幸福的了。能够知道他在这里，和他并排躺下，感受着身边的他的温暖，能够和他头抵着头，左手和他的右手十指相扣，这一切已经足够幸福的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">LAILA LIKES MURREE'S cool, foggy mornings and its dazzling twilights, the dark brilliance of the sky at night; the green of the pines and the soft brown of the squirrels darting up and down the sturdy tree trunks; the sudden downpours that send shoppers in the Mall scrambling for awning cover. She likes the souvenir shops, and the various hotels that house tourists, even as the locals bemoan the constant construction, the expansion of infrastructure that they say is eating away at Murree's natural beauty. Laila finds it odd that people should lament the building of buildings. In Kabul, they would celebrate it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉喜欢穆里雾蒙蒙的寒冷早晨、落霞满天的黄昏和星光点点的夜空，苍郁的松树，在粗壮的树干蹦上蹦下的褐色松鼠，让摩尔街上的店主手忙脚乱地撑起雨篷的阵雨。尽管当地人对无穷无尽的建设颇有不满，他们说这些建筑物的扩张会破坏穆里的自然景观，但莱拉喜欢那些出售纪念品的商店和各种各样的接待游客的旅馆。人们居然会为盖房子而哀叹，莱拉觉得这太奇怪了。要是在喀布尔，人们庆祝还来不及呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the middle of the night, when Laila woke up thirsty, she found their hands still clamped together, in the white-knuckle, anxious way of children clutching balloon strings.</div>

<div class="line_en">She likes that they have a bathroom, not an outhouse but an actual bathroom, with a toilet that flushes, a shower, and a sink too, with twin faucets from which she can draw, with a flick of her wrist, water, either hot or cold. She likes waking up to the sound of Alyona bleating in the morning, and the harmlessly cantankerous cook, Adiba, who works marvels in the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她喜欢他们有一个浴室，不是一个室外的厕所，而是一个真正的浴室，里面有抽水马桶、淋浴器，还有一个洗脸盆。洗脸盆上有两个水龙头，她只要用手腕一撞，就有热水或者冷水流出来。她喜欢早晨醒来听见阿里安娜的咩咩叫，还有阿狄芭——那个脾气急躁但没有恶意的厨师——在厨房忙个不停的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the mornings, Laila follows Tariq from room to room. Keys jingle from a ring clipped to his waist and a spray bottle of window cleaner dangles from the belt loops of his jeans. Laila brings a pail filled with rags, disinfectant, a toilet brush, and spray wax for the dressers. Aziza tags along, a mop in one hand, the bean-stuffed doll Mariam had made for her in the other. Zalmai trails them reluctantly, sulkily, always a few steps behind.</div>

And one day it will hit him, walking along some meandering river, or gazing out at an untracked snowfield, that his father's disappearance is no longer an open, raw wound.
