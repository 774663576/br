<div class="line_en">Then he carried her absurdly oversize bags to the bus. Felt the driver smelling of wine as he went by, but concluded that maybe this was the way they did things in Spain and left it at that. Sat there in the seat as Sonja moved his hand to her belly and that was when he felt his child kicking, for the first and last time. He stood up and went to the bathroom and when he was halfway down the aisle the bus lurched, scraped against the central barrier, and then there was a moment of silence. As if time was taking a deep breath. Then: an explosion of splintering glass. The merciless screeching of twisting metal. Violent crunches as the cars behind the bus slammed into it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every man needs to know what he's fighting for." That was apparently what people said. Or at least it was what Sonja had once read out aloud to Ove from one of her books. Ove couldn't remember which one; there were always so many books around that woman. In Spain she had bought a whole bag of them, despite not even speaking Spanish. "I'll learn while I'm reading," she said. As if that was the way you did it. Ove told her he was a bit more about thinking for himself rather than reading what a lot of other clots had on their minds. Sonja just smiled and caressed his cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“每个人都必须知道他在为什么奋斗。”这显然又是谁说过的话。至少这是索雅曾经从她的哪本书上读给欧维听的。欧维不记得是哪本，这女人身边总有那么多书。她在西班牙就买了一大包，尽管她连西班牙语都看不懂。“我一边学一边读呗。”她说。就好像这很正常。欧维说，他自己脑子里那些事还想不过来，哪有工夫去读别的笨蛋在动什么脑筋。索雅笑着拍拍他的脸颊，这倒让欧维无言以对。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove was thrown about and only remembered falling on his stomach. He looked around for her, terrified, among the tumult of human bodies, but she was gone. He threw himself forward, cutting himself under a rain of glass from the ceiling, but it was as if a furious wild animal were holding him back and forcing him down on the floor in unreflecting humiliation. It would pursue him every night for the rest of his life: his utter impotence in the situation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维翻滚着，只记得肚子先着地。他惊恐地眨着眼，在一堆喧闹的躯体中寻找她的踪影，但她不见了。他挣扎着向前，顾不上头顶暴雨般落下的玻璃碎片，但就像被隐形的野兽困住了一般。就好像恶魔伸出魔爪，一把将他强摁在地上，予以无情羞辱。在他有生之年的每一个夜晚，这种感觉与他形影不离：彻底的无助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sat by her bed every moment of the first week. Until the nurses insisted that he shower and change his clothes. Everywhere they looked at him with sympathetic stares and expressed their "condolences." A doctor came in and spoke to Ove in an indifferent, clinical voice about the need to "prepare himself for the likelihood of her not waking up again." Ove threw that doctor through a door. A door that was locked and shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一周，他每时每刻都坐在她的床边，直到护士坚决地用手强行拉他去洗澡更衣。所到之处，人们都对他投来怜悯的目光并送上“同情的慰藉”。一个医生用冷漠而专业的语气告诉欧维“做好她再也不会苏醒的准备”。欧维把这个医生推出了门。一扇紧锁的门。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">And she wept. An ancient, inconsolable despair that screamed and tore and shredded them both as countless hours passed. Time and sorrow and fury flowed together in stark, long-drawn darkness. Ove knew there and then that he would never forgive himself for having got up from his seat at that exact moment, for not being there to protect them. And knew that this pain was forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她哭了。一种久远的、难以慰藉的恸哭钻刺着、撕扯着他们的内心，久久不息。时间、悲怆和愤懑交织着，凝聚成一片更漫长的黑暗。此时此刻，欧维知道，他永远不会原谅自己当时没坐在座位上守护着他们。他知道这种痛苦将在心里永存。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the tenth day, as the rain smattered against the windows and the radio spoke of the worst storm in several decades, Sonja opened her eyes in torturous little slits, caught sight of Ove, and stole her hand into his. Enfolded her finger in the palm of his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第十天，电台里说这是几十年来最糟糕的暴风雨天气，伴着窗外风雨交加的响动，索雅的眼睛艰难地睁开一条细缝，看见欧维后，她把手伸向他，把手指钻进他的掌心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she fell asleep and slept through the night. When she woke up again the nurses offered to tell her, but Ove grimly insisted that he was the one who would do it. Then he told her everything in a composed voice, while caressing her hands in his, as if they were very, very cold. He told her about the driver smelling of wine and the bus veering into the crash barrier and the collision. The smell of burned rubber. The earsplitting crashing sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她又睡了一整夜。醒来的时候，她请求护士告诉她发生的一切，但欧维坚持认为应该由他来说。他用沉着的嗓音对她讲述事情的起因经过，自始至终抚摸着她的双手，就像它们非常非常冰冷。他告诉她，司机如何一身酒气，大巴如何蹭上护栏，后面的车如何撞上来。橡胶燃烧的味道，震耳欲聋的撞击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And that's how it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他们就这么做了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the following months, back in Sweden, Ove met innumerable men in white shirts. They sat behind desks made of light-colored wood in various municipal offices and they apparently had endless amounts of time to instruct Ove in what documents had to be filled in for various purposes, but no time at all to discuss the measures that were needed for Sonja to get better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个月里，欧维见到了不计其数的穿白衬衫的人。他们坐在各种有关部门的浅色木制办公桌背后，好像有无尽的时间来指导欧维为了各种目的填写各种表格，却没有时间讨论帮助索雅尽快康复的实际措施。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A woman was dispatched to the hospital from one of the municipal authorities, where she bullishly explained that Sonja could be placed in "a service home for other people in her situation." Something about how "the strain of everyday life" quite understandably could be "excessive" for Ove. She didn't say it right out, but it was clear as crystal what she was driving at. She did not believe that Ove could see himself staying with his wife now. "Under present conditions," she kept repeating, nodding discreetly at the bedside. She spoke to Ove as if Sonja were not even in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="某个政府机关派了个女人到医院来，匆匆忙忙地解释，说可以安排索雅去为“类似情况”设立的“疗养院”。她完全理解欧维“难以承受”这样“日复一日的艰辛生活”。她没有明说，但言下之意昭然若揭。她不认为欧维会愿意留守在太太身边。“就目前的情况而言”，她一直重复着这句话，并时不时谨慎地冲床头点点头。她对欧维说话的方式，就好像索雅根本不在房间里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Sonja would not have been Sonja if she had let the darkness win. So, one morning, Ove did not know how many days had passed since the accident, expressing herself quite succinctly, she declared that she wanted to start having physiotherapy. And when Ove looked at her as if it were his own spine screaming like a tortured animal every time she moved, she gently leaned her head against his chest and whispered: "We can busy ourselves with living or with dying, Ove. We have to move on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但如果让黑暗赢了这场战争，她也就不再是索雅了。一天早上，欧维也不知道是意外后的哪一天，她简单明确地表示想接受物理康复治疗。她的每一个动作都牵动着欧维，就像他自己的脊椎如困兽般在尖叫，她把自己弱小的头靠在他的胸口，低声说：“不管忙着生存还是死亡，欧维。我们都必须继续走下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Afterwards he had to go and ask the nurses, who'd almost been hit by it, if they knew where it had gone. Which of course made him even angrier. It was the first time since the accident that he heard Sonja laughing. As if it was pouring out of her, without the slightest possibility of stopping it, like she was being wrestled to the ground by her own giggling. She laughed and laughed and laughed until the vowels were rolling across the walls and floors, as if they meant to do away with the laws of time and space. It made Ove feel as if his chest was slowly rising out of the ruins of a collapsed house after an earthquake. It gave his heart space to beat again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他不得不出门问那些险些让鞋砸中的护士有没有看见鞋去哪儿了。这在他的怒火上又浇了把油。于是，意外以后，他第一次听见索雅发出笑声。那种自然流露，就像完全无法压抑的可能，就像她被自己的笑声压得直不了身。她笑啊笑啊，直到那些韵母洒了一墙一地，就像他们打算推翻时空的定律。这让欧维觉得，胸口慢慢从地震后房子的残骸中浮了出来，再次为他的心跳提供了空间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went home and rebuilt the whole house, ripped out the old countertop and put in a new, lower one. Even managed to find a specially made stove. Reconstructed the doorframes and fitted ramps over all the thresholds. The day after Sonja was allowed to leave the hospital, she went back to her teacher training. In the spring she sat her examination. There was an advertisement in the newspaper for a teaching position in a school with the worst reputation in town, with the sort of class that no qualified teacher with all the parts of her brain correctly screwed together would voluntarily face. It was attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder before attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder had been invented. "There's no hope for these boys and girls," the headmaster soberly explained in the interview. "This is not education, this is storage." Maybe Sonja understood how it felt to be described as such. The vacant position attracted only one applicant, and she got those boys and girls to read Shakespeare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回到排屋的家中，改造了整个厨房，把旧的操作台拆掉，新装了更矮的。他甚至搞到了一个特殊的灶台，并重修了所有门框，又在每道门槛前安装了坡道。出院之后的第二天，索雅就回到了她的师范学院。第二年春季，她参加了毕业考试。报纸上登了一则教师职位招聘启事，那个单位是城里最声名狼藉的学校，那些班级，任何正规教育出身并且脑子上各个零部件都正确安装了的老师，都不会主动请缨接管。那是在多动症这个名词发明之前的多动症患儿班。“这些男孩和女孩完全没有希望，”校长本人在面试上疲惫地承认，“这不是教学，而是收容。”索雅理解这种心情。该职位只收到一份申请——她让这些男孩和女孩读起了莎士比亚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The only home we're going to is our own! Where we LIVE!" Ove roared at her, and in pure frustration and anger he threw one of Sonja's shoes out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们只有一个地方要去，那就是我们自己的家！我们住的地方！”欧维冲着走廊里吼，出于极度挫折和愤怒，他朝门外扔了一只索雅的鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the meantime Ove was so weighed down with anger that Sonja sometimes had to ask him to go outside so he didn't demolish the furniture. It pained her infinitely to see his shoulders so loaded down with the will to destroy. Destroy that bus driver. The travel agency. The crash barrier of that highway. The wine producer. Everything and everyone. Punch and keep punching until every bastard had been obliterated. That was all he wanted to do. He put that anger in his shed. He put it in the garage. He spread it over the ground during his inspection rounds. But that wasn't all. In the end he also started putting it in letters. He wrote to the Spanish government. To the Swedish authorities. To the police. To the court. But no one took responsibility. No one cared. They answered by reference to legal texts or other authorities. Made excuses. When the council refused to build a ramp at the stairs of the school where Sonja worked, Ove wrote letters and complaints for months. He wrote letters to newspapers. He tried to sue the council. He literally inundated them with the unfathomable vengefulness of a father who has been robbed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其间，欧维总是憋着满腔的怒火，索雅偶尔不得不请他夜晚离家片刻，以免破坏家具。看着他双肩背负着摧毁的欲望，总让她感到无尽痛苦。他想摧毁那个司机、那家旅行社、高速公路边的护栏、酿酒师，所有的一切。一拳又一拳，直到所有的浑蛋倒地。这就是他的欲望。他把愤怒发泄在储藏室里，发泄在车库里，播撒在小区巡逻沿途的地面上，但这还不够。最后，他开始把愤怒发泄在写信上。他给西班牙政府写信，给瑞典政府、警察、法院写信。但没人愿意承担责任，没人关心。他们的回答只是照搬规章制度或推卸给其他政府职能部门。一副事不关己的姿态。当政府拒绝改建索雅所在学校的楼梯时，欧维写信申诉了几个月。他投诉到报社，尝试起诉。作为一个被剥夺父亲身份的人，他把所有仇恨都切切实实地迁怒于那些人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonja saw everything. She understood where he was hurting. So she let him be angry, let all that anger find its outlet somewhere, in some way. But on one of those early summer evenings in May that always come along bearing gentle promises about the summer ahead, she rolled up to him, the wheels leaving soft marks on the parquet floor. He was sitting at the kitchen table writing one of his letters, and she took his pen away from him, slipped her hand into his, and pressed her finger into his rough palm. Leaned her forehead tenderly against his chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维做的一切，索雅都看在眼里。她知道他的苦衷，所以就任由他去抗争，去愤怒，让所有的怨恨以某种方式在某个地方找到出口。但某个五月的夏夜傍晚，空气里预示着即将到来的盛夏模样，她来到他身边，轮椅在身后的地板上留下浅浅印记。他坐在厨房桌边写信，她从他手里拿走了钢笔，把手滑向他，把手指钻进他粗糙的掌心。又将额头轻柔地靠在他的胸口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But everywhere, sooner or later, he was stopped by men in white shirts with strict, smug expressions on their faces. And one couldn't fight them. Not only did they have the state on their side, they were the state. The last complaint was rejected. The fighting was over because the white shirts had decided so. And Ove never forgave them that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning Ove got up at dawn, drove the Saab to her school, and with his own bare hands built the disabled ramp the council was refusing to put up. And after that she came home every evening for as long as Ove could remember and told him, with fire in her eyes, about her boys and girls. The ones who arrived in the classroom with police escorts yet when they left could recite four-hundred-year-old poetry. The ones who could make her cry and laugh and sing until her voice was bouncing off the ceilings of their little house. Ove could never make head nor tail of those impossible kids, but he was not beyond liking them for what they did to Sonja.</div>
