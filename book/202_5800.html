<div class="line_en">But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, "I knew you'd come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"They sealed off all of those before the start of the year," said Neville. "There's no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits." He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. "Never mind that stuff… Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It's everywhere, everyone's talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“开学前他们就把那些通道全封死了，”纳威说，“入口施了魔咒，出口有食死徒和摄魂怪把守，现在根本不可能从那里进出了。”他开始倒退着走，笑容满面地细细端详着他们。“别管那些事啦……是真的吗？你们真的闯进了古灵阁？真的骑着火龙逃走了？事情都传开了，大家都在说，泰瑞·布特吃饭时在礼堂里大声嚷嚷这事儿，被卡罗兄妹打了一顿！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, it got more difficult as time went on," said Neville. "We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they'd chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，后来形势越来越严峻了，”纳威说，“圣诞节时失去了卢娜，金妮复活节后再没回来，而当时我们三个相当于是领头的。卡罗兄妹似乎知道许多事情都是我在后面策划的，开始狠狠地惩罚我，后来迈克尔·科纳去放一个被他们锁住的一年级新生时不幸被发现，他们把他折磨得可惨了。这把许多人都吓跑了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, well, I couldn't ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That's when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，我不能要求别人经受迈克尔的那种遭遇，所以就放弃了那些危险的做法。但我们仍在战斗，做一些地下工作，直到两个星期前。那时他们大概断定只有一个办法能让我收敛，就去找我奶奶了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”哈利、罗恩和赫敏同时问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah," said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, "well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s'pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was," he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, "they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn't need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway," Neville laughed, "Dawlish is still in St. Mungo's and Gran's on the run. She sent me a letter," he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, "telling me she was proud of me, that I'm my parents' son, and to keep it up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，”纳威说，通道的坡度很陡，他说话微微带喘，“哼，可以看得出他们的想法。绑架孩子让亲属循规蹈矩，这一招一直很灵，我就猜到他们早晚会把这招儿反过来用。问题是，”他面对着他们，哈利惊讶地看到他竟然满脸笑容，“他们太不自量力了。奶奶，一个不起眼的老女巫，独自一个人过活，他们大概以为用不着派个特别厉害的人去。结果，”纳威大笑起来，“德力士还在圣芒戈医院躺着呢，奶奶逃走了。她给我捎了封信，”他用手拍拍长袍胸前的口袋，“告诉我说她为我骄傲，还说我不愧是我父母的儿子，叫我坚持下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden-cased wireless.</div>

<div class="line_en">They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle… Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又都摇了摇头。哈利看看罗恩和赫敏，在两人脸上看到了跟他同样的失望。一件失踪了这么久的东西，又没有任何明显的线索，似乎不太可能是那个藏在城堡里的魂器……然而，没等他提出新的问题，秋·张又说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder's Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist's approach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利以前曾经多次在城堡夜游，但他的心从没跳得这么激烈过，他深知自己这次行动关系重大，必须做到万无一失。哈利和卢娜走过地板上的一方方月光，经过一套套铠甲——轻轻的脚步声震得那些头盔嘎嘎作响，转过一个个弯——天知道那后面会躲藏着什么。每当光线稍亮一点，他们就查看一下活点地图，有两次还停下脚步让一个幽灵通过，这才没有引起他的注意。哈利时刻提防着遇到障碍，他最担心的是皮皮鬼，每走一步都竖起耳朵，倾听有没有那个捣蛋鬼走近的最轻微的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空无一人的拉文克劳公共休息室是一间很大的圆形屋子，比哈利在霍格沃茨看见的所有房间都更空灵。墙上开着一扇扇雅致的拱形窗户，挂着蓝色和青铜色的丝绸：白天，拉文克劳的同学可以看见周围的群山，风景优美。天花板是穹顶的，上面绘着星星，下面深蓝色的地毯上也布满星星。房间里有桌椅、书架，门对面的壁龛里立着一尊高高的白色大理石塑像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast.

<div class="line_cn" title="卢娜伸出一只苍白的手，这只手在半空中移动着，没与胳膊和身体相连，显得十分怪异。她敲了一下门，在一片寂静中，哈利觉得这声音简直就像炮弹炸响了。鹰嘴立刻张开了，但没有发出鸟叫，而是用一个温柔的、音乐般的声音说：“凤凰和火，先有哪一个？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna's house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw's plinth to read them.</div>
