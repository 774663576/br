Since then, he has had to depend on the arms of his younger brother. For the sake of taking care of him, his younger brother became his shadow, never leaving him alone for years.

<div class="line_en">One late night, he suffered from diarrhea and had to wake up his younger brother. His younger brother accompanied him into the toilet and then went back the dorm to wait. But being so tired, his younger brother fell asleep; leaving him on the toilet for two hours till the teacher on duty discovered him. As the two brothers grew up together, they had their share of problems and they would often quarrel. Then one day, his younger brother wanted to live separate from him, living his own life, as many normal people do. So he was heart-broken and didn't know what to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though her elder sister who was studying in another city, showed her willingness to take care of her, she was determined to be completely independent. At school, she always studied hard. Most of all she learned to be self-reliant. Once she wrote the following in her composition: "I am lucky. Though I lost my arms, I still have legs; I am lucky. Though my wings are broken, my heart can still fly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然她在另一个城市读书的姐姐表示愿意照顾她，她还是决定要完全靠自己。在学校里，她一直很努力地学习。最重要的是，她学会了自力更生。她曾在一篇作文里写道：“我是幸运的，虽然失去了双臂，但我还有双腿；我是幸运的，虽然翅膀断了，但心依旧在飞翔。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day, the boy and the girl were both invited to appear on a television interview program. The boy told the TV host about his uncertain future at being left on his own, whereas the girl was full of enthusiasm for her life. They both were asked to write something on a piece of paper with their toes. The boy wrote: My younger brother's arms are my arms; while the girl wrote: Broken wings, flying heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had both endured the same ordeal, but their different attitudes determined the nature of their lives. It is true that life is unpredictable. Disasters can strike at any time. How you handle misfortune when confronted with it, is the true test of your character. If you choose only to complain and escape from the ordeal, it will always follow you wherever you go. But if you decide to be strong, the hardship will turn out to be a fortune on which new hopes will arise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都经历了同样的苦难，但不同的态度决定了他们不同的生活状态。生活是不可预测的，这是事实。灾害随时都可能降临。如何应对苦难，则是对你品格的真正考验。如果你选择了抱怨和逃避磨难，那么不管你走到哪里，它都会永远跟随你。但是，如果你决定要坚强，那么苦难将会成为一种财富，为你带来新希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
