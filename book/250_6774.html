<div class="line_en">The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind Nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland; the sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere; far in the empty sky a solitary esophagus slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God.</div>

<div class="line_en">October is the time;1900; Hope Canyon is the place, a silver-mining camp away down in the Esmeralda region. It is a secluded spot, high and remote; recent as to discovery; thought by its occupants to be rich in metal; a year or twos prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other. For inhabitants, the camp has about two hundred miners, one white woman and child, several Chinese washermen, five squaws, and a dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbit-skin robes, battered plug hats, and tin-can necklaces. There are no mills as yet; no church, no newspaper. The camp has existed but two years; it has made no big strike; the world is ignorant of its name and place.</div>

<div class="line_en">Flint Buckner's cabin was the last one of the village, going south; his silver claim was at the other end of the village, northward, and a little beyond the last hut in that direction. He was a sour creature, unsociable, and had no companionships. People who had tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him. His history was not known. Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it; others said no. If asked, Hillyer said no, he was not acquainted with it. Flint had a meek English youth of sixteen or seventeen with him, whom he treated roughly, both in public and in private; and of course this lad was applied to for information, but with no success. Fetlock Jones; name of the youth; said that Flint picked him up on a prospecting tramp, and as he had neither home nor friends in America, he had found it wise to stay and take Buckner's hard usage for the sake of the salary, which was bacon and beans. Further than this he could offer no testimony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗林特·布克纳的小木屋是屯子南头的最后一幢；他采矿的地盘却在北面，在屯子的另一头，比屯子北头的最后一幢木屋还远一点儿。他脾气乖戾，不好交往，也没有朋友。那些想跟他套近乎的人碰了钉子以后，都掉头而去。没有人知道他的来历。有人说萨姆·希里尔知道，可别人不相信。人们问希里尔，他也摇头，说不大清楚。弗林特身边有一个十六七岁的英国小伙子，脾气温顺，弗林特无论人前人后都像凶神恶煞般地对待他。人们自然而然地想从这小伙子身上套点情况，却没有得手。这个名叫菲特洛克·琼斯的小伙子说，弗林特有一次在找矿时收留了他，因为他在美国举目无亲，所以还不如留下来给布克纳卖苦力挣点薪水，这薪水就是咸肉和豆子。除了这些，他就一句话也不肯再说了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On both sides of the canyon the mountains rise wall-like, three thousand feet, and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the sun only once a day, when he sails over at noon. The village is a couple of miles long; the cabins stand well apart from each other. The tavern is the only frame house; the only house, one might say. It occupies a central position, and is the evening resort of the population. They drink there, and play seven-up and dominoes; also billiards, for there is a table, crossed all over with torn places repaired with court-plaster; there are some cues, but no leathers; some chipped balls which clatter when they run, and do not slow up gradually, but stop suddenly and sit down; there is a part of a cube of chalk, with a projecting jag of flint in it; and the man who can score six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bars expense.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now, and under his meek exterior he was slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put upon him. For the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts; more bitterly, perhaps, than do the manlier sort, who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of endurance has been reached.

<div class="line_en">The people could not understand this. The boys miseries went steadily on, week after week. It is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he was employing his spare time. He slept in an out-cabin near Flints; and there, nights, he nursed his bruises and his humiliations, and studied and studied over a single problem; how he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out. It was the only joy he had in life; these hours were the only ones in the twenty-four which he looked forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们百思不解。一个星期，又一个星期，那男孩继续挨着昔日子。假如大家知道他怎样支配自己的工余时间，就很有可能理解他了。他睡在离弗林特住处不远的一座小木屋里，每天夜里，他强忍被侮辱和伤害的感情，一遍又一遍地思考着同一个问题——怎样杀了弗林特。布克纳又不被人发觉。这是他生活中的惟一乐趣；在一天二十四小时中，他只盼望这几个小时赶快来临，然后愉快地度过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought of poison. No; that would not serve; the inquest would reveal where it was procured and who had procured it. He thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place when Flint would be homeward bound at midnight; his unvarying hour for the trip. No; somebody might be near, and catch him. He thought of stabbing him in his sleep. No; he might strike an inefficient blow, and Flint would seize him. He examined a hundred different ways; none of them would answer; for in even the very obscurest and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a risk, a chance, a possibility that he might be found out. He would have none of that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想到了用毒药。不行——这不是稳妥的办法；一审问就能查出是在哪儿下的毒以及谁下的毒。他想到半夜里在弗林特回家的路上，挑一个僻静的地方从背后开枪——弗林特总是在这个时候回家。不行——有人会听见枪声，逮住他。他想等弗林特熟睡时动刀。不行——也许一刺不中要害，反倒被弗林特擒住。他琢磨了一百种不同的方法，没有一种可行；因为在这些方法里，即使是最隐秘的方法也有致命的缺陷，使得他要冒风险，有可能被发觉。这些方法全都不能用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he was patient, endlessly patient. There was no hurry, he said to himself. He would never leave Flint till he left him a corpse; there was no hurry; he would find the way. It was somewhere, and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it. Yes, somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace, not even the faintest clew to the murderer; there was no hurry; he would find that way, and then; oh, then, it would just be good to be alive! Meantime he would diligently keep up his reputation for meekness; and also, as always theretofore, he would allow no one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days before the before-mentioned October morning Flint had bought some things, and he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flints cabin: a fresh box of candles, which they put in the corner; a tin can of blasting-powder, which they placed upon the candle-box; a keg of blasting-powder, which they placed under Flints bunk; a huge coil of fuse, which they hung on a peg. Fetlock reasoned that Flints mining operations had outgrown the pick, and that blasting was about to begin now. He had seen blasting done, and he had a notion of the process, but he had never helped in it. His conjecture was right; blasting-time had come. In the morning the pair carried fuse, drills, and the powder-can to the shaft; it was now eight feet deep, and to get into it and out of it a short ladder was used. They descended, and by command Fetlock held the drill; without any instructions as to the right way to hold it; and Flint proceeded to strike. The sledge came down; the drill sprang out of Fetlocks hand, almost as a matter of course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在上述十月那个早晨的两天以前，弗林特和菲特洛克一起把买的一些东西搬回自己的木屋去。他们把一箱蜡烛放在屋角，把一铁罐炸药放在蜡烛箱子上，一小桶炸药放在了弗林特的床铺底下，还有一大盘导火索，他们挂在了一个木桩子上。菲特洛克推测弗林特探矿已经告一段落，就要开始爆破了。他曾经见过爆破，明白爆破的程序，但是他从来没有参与过。他的推测确实不错，爆破的时间到了。俩人一早抬起导火索、钢钎和炸药来到了矿井。矿井已经有八英尺深，他们用一架短梯子爬进爬出。他们下了井，菲特洛克按照弗林特的吩咐握住钢钎，不过弗林特并没有告诉他握钢钎的正确姿势。弗林特抡起大锤。不出所料，大锤落下时，菲特洛克握住的钢钎震飞了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again.</div>
