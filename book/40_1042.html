<div class="line_en">The only task Mammy never neglected was her five daily namaz prayers. She ended each namaz with her head hung low, hands held before her face, palms up, muttering a prayer for God to bring victory to the Mujahideen. Laila had to shoulder more and more of the chores. If she didn't tend to the house, she was apt to find clothes, shoes, open rice bags, cans of beans, and dirty dishes strewn about everywhere. Laila washed Mammy's dresses and changed her sheets. She coaxed her out of bed for baths and meals. She was the one who ironed Babi's shirts and folded his pants. Increasingly, she was the cook.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mammy lay in bed most days. She wore black. She picked at her hair and gnawed on the mole below her lip. When Mammy was awake, Laila found her staggering through the house. She always ended up in Laila's room, as though she would run into the boys sooner or later if she just kept walking into the room where they had once slept and farted and fought with pillows. But all she ran into was their absence. And Laila. Which, Laila believed, had become one and the same to Mammy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多数日子里，妈妈躺在床上。她穿黑色的衣服。她揪自己的头发，掐她的嘴唇下面那颗痣。妈妈醒着的时候，莱拉会发现她跌跌撞撞地在屋子里走来走去。每次到了最后，她总会走进莱拉的房间，好像只要在那两个男孩睡过、玩过、用枕头打过架的房间里不停地走啊走，她便迟早有一天能够找到他们。但他们已经人去楼空。她所遇到的只有莱拉。莱拉相信，在妈妈眼里，她跟两个哥哥一样，也是不存在的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ailments that would hound Mammy for the rest of her days began. Chest pains and headaches, joint aches and night sweats, paralyzing pains in her ears, lumps no one else could feel. Babi took her to a doctor, who took blood and urine, shot X-rays of Mammy's body, but found no physical illness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将会折磨妈妈余生的病痛出现了。胸痛，头痛，关节痛，夜间盗汗，双耳痹痛，还有别的人摸不到的肿块。爸爸带她去看医生，医生做了血检和尿检，给妈妈的身体照了X光，但没有找到什么身体上的疾病。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila lay there and listened, wishing Mammy would notice that she, Laila, hadn't become shaheed, that she was alive, here, in bed with her, that she had hopes and a future. But Laila knew that her future was no match for her brothers' past. They had overshadowed her in life. They would obliterate her in death. Mammy was now the curator of their lives' museum and she, Laila, a mere visitor. A receptacle for their myths. The parchment on which Mammy meant to ink their legends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉躺在那儿，静静倾听，希望妈妈会意识到她，莱拉，还没有殉难，意识到她还活着，在这儿，和她一起躺在床上，意识到她还有希望和未来。但莱拉知道她的未来根本无法和两个哥哥的过去相提并论。他们给她的生活投上了阴影。她至死也忘不了他们。他们的生活如今成了一个博物馆，妈妈是馆长，至于莱拉，莱拉只是一个访客。一个用来盛放他们的故事的容器。一张妈妈用来写下他们的传说的羊皮纸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes, after she was done with her chores, Laila crawled into bed next to Mammy. She wrapped her arms around her, laced her fingers with her mother's, buried her face in her hair. Mammy would stir, murmur something. Inevitably, she would start in on a story about the boys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，做完家务活之后，莱拉会爬上妈妈的床，在她身边躺下。她会伸手抱住妈妈，手指扣着她的手指，把脸埋在她的头发之中。妈妈会惊醒，喃喃自语。她总是不可避免地说起有关那两个男孩的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day, as they were lying this way, Mammy said, "Ahmad was going to be a leader. He had the charisma for it. People three times his age listened to him with respect, Laila. It was something to see. And Noor. Oh, my Noor. He was always making sketches of buildings and bridges. He was going to be an architect, you know. He was going to transform Kabul with his designs. And now they're both shaheed, my boys, both martyrs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，她们就这样躺着，妈妈说：“艾哈迈德本来可以成为将领。他有这种魄力。年纪比他大三倍的人也很敬重地听他说话，莱拉。那是能够料到的事情。还有努尔。嗯，我的乖努尔。他总是画下一些房子和桥梁。你知道吗，他本来可以成为建筑师的。他本来可以改变喀布尔的城市布局的。现在他们两个都殉难了，我的儿子们，都殉难了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The messenger who came with the news, he said that when they brought the boys back to camp, Ahmad Shah Massoud personally oversaw the burial. He said a prayer for them at the gravesite.

<div class="line_en">"I wish there was something I could do," Laila said, meaning it. But it came out sounding broad, perfunctory, like the token consolation of a kind stranger.</div>

Then I think of all the ticks, all the minutes, all the hours and days and weeks and months and years waiting for me. All of it without them. And I can't breathe then, like someone's stepping on my heart, Laila. I get so weak. So weak I just want to collapse somewhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有时候，”妈妈嗓音嘶哑地说，“我听见走廊的时钟滴答、滴答响。然后我就会想到，还有这么多秒钟、这么多分钟、这么多日子、这么多个星期、这么多个月、这么多年在等着我。而且所有这些时间里面都不会有他们。我一想到这个就喘不过气来，莱拉，好像有人在践踏我的心脏。我变得这么虚弱。虚弱得我只想随便找个地方倒下。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila sat up, looking down at Mammy. There were gray strands in Mammy's hair now. And it startled Laila how much weight Mammy, who'd always been plump, had lost. Her cheeks had a sallow, drawn look. The blouse she was wearing drooped over her shoulders, and there was a gaping space between her neck and the collar. More than once Laila had seen the wedding band slide off Mammy's finger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉坐起来，朝下看着妈妈。现在妈妈的头发出现几绺灰白了。莱拉猛然发觉本来一直很丰满的妈妈已经瘦掉了很多。她穿的上衣变得松松垮垮，领口和脖子之间出现了一道很大的空间。莱拉不止一次地看见结婚戒指从妈妈的手指上脱落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd talked about it to Hasina. At Hasina's suggestion, the two of them had emptied the bottle of aspirin in the gutter, hidden the kitchen knives and the sharp kebab skewers beneath the rug under the couch. Hasina had found a rope in the yard. When Babi couldn't find his razors, Laila had to tell him of her fears. He dropped on the edge of the couch, hands between his knees. Laila waited for some kind of reassurance from him. But all she got was a bewildered, hollow-eyed look.</div>

I want to see my sons' dream come true. I want to see the day the Soviets go home disgraced, the day the Mujahideen come to Kabul in victory. I want to be there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free, so the boys see it too. They'll see it through my eyes."</div>
