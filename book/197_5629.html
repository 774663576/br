<div class="line_en">Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys' bedroom.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”弗雷德说，“这样说吧——家养小精灵的魔法也很了不得，但没有主人允许，他们一般不能使用魔法。我想多比是被人派来阻止你回霍格沃茨的，有人想捉弄你。你在学校有什么仇人吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house.
