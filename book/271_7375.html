<div class="line_en">Sometimes it was so easy to forget that I was kissing a vampire. Not because he seemed ordinary or human -- I could never for a second forget that I was holding someone more angel than man in my arms -- but because he made it seem like nothing at all to have his lips against my lips, my face, my throat. He claimed he was long past the temptation my blood used to be for him, that the idea of losing me had cured him of any desire for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些时候我很容易忘掉我正在和一个吸血鬼接吻。并不仅仅因为他看上去跟普通人一样——我从没有片刻怀疑过在我怀里的，于其是人类更不如说是天使——并且当他的双唇抵上我的唇瓣、我的脸颊、我的喉咙时，什么都不会发生。他曾经断言，他已经成功克制住了我的血对他的诱惑，差点失去我的念头帮助他克服了欲望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我睁开双眼，发现他也有同样的动作，凝视着我的脸庞。完全没有理由会让他这样注视着我，好像我是他好不容易获得的奖赏而不是一个侥幸的幸运儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our gazes locked for a moment; his golden eyes were so deep that I imagined I could see all the way into his soul. It seemed silly that this fact -- the existence of his soul -- had ever been in question, even if he was a vampire. He had the most beautiful soul, more beautiful than his brilliant mind or his incomparable face or his glorious body.</div>

<div class="line_en">He couldn't see into my mind, though, the way he saw into everyone else's. Who knew why -- some strange glitch in my brain that made it immune to all the extraordinary and frightening things some immortals could do. (Only my mind was immune; my body was still subject to vampires with abilities that worked in ways other than Edward's.) But I was seriously grateful to whatever malfunction it was that kept my thoughts a secret. It was just too embarrassing to consider the alternative.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可以看穿任何一个人的心思，却无法读取我的。天知道为什么——大脑某个奇怪的故障让我可以屏蔽所有吸血鬼欲加之在我身上的超能力，或者是令人害怕的东西。（只有我的精神层面是具有抵抗力的。我的肉体对Edward这一能力类型以外的其它类型的吸血鬼能力，仍然会做出反应。）但是我依然感激这小小的失灵，可以将我的思想对外保密。否则，我就可能窘不堪言了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At least, if I had to be bundled up, Edward's shirt was on the floor. I never got over the shock of how perfect his body was -- white, cool, and polished as marble. I ran my hand down his stone chest now, tracing across the flat planes of his stomach, just marveling. A light shudder rippled through him, and his mouth found mine again. Carefully, I let the tip of my tongue press against his glass-smooth lip, and he sighed. His sweet breath washed -- cold and delicious -- over my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起码，如果当我需要被裹起来的时候，爱德华的衬衫也差不多是在地上了。他雪白、冰冷、如大理石般光滑的身体，我每一次见到都忍不住惊叹。眼下我的手正滑过他坚硬如石的胸膛，抚摸他平坦的腹部，啧啧称奇。一股轻微的颤栗传遍他全身，他的唇又一次贴了上来。小心翼翼地，我用舌尖扫过他光滑如镜的嘴唇。他叹了口气，冰冷香甜的气息拂面而来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was pretty close to my happy place. Charlie slept obliviously in his room, which was almost as good as being alone. We were curled up on my small bed, intertwined as much as it was possible, considering the thick afghan I was swathed in like a cocoon. I hated the necessity of the blanket, but it sort of ruined the romance when my teeth started chattering. Charlie would notice if I turned the heat on in August…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我欢乐小屋的生活即将划上句号。查理浑然不知得睡在他的屋子里，所以我们跟独处没有什么分别。我们尽可能地相拥着，蜷曲在我那张小床上，厚重的阿富汗毛毯把我裹得像枚粽子。我恨我还需要毛毯，因为如果我的牙齿开始打架，多少会破坏这浪漫的气氛。如果在8月份的天还发烧的话也会引起查理的注意……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He started to pull away -- that was his automatic response whenever he decided things had gone too far, his reflex reaction whenever he most wanted to keep going. Edward had spent most of his life rejecting any kind of physical gratification. I knew it was terrifying to him trying to change those habits now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开始把我推开——每次当他觉得事情快要变得失控时，他本能地会做出这种反应，也是他每次及其想要将某件事进行下去时的条件反射。爱德华花了大部分的时间来拒绝任何形式的肉体上的满足感。我知道要他现在改变这一习惯是多么艰难。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It would be touchy to have Tanya's family in the same room with our guests from the Quileute reservation, Jacob's father and the Clearwaters. The Denalis were no fans of the werewolves. In fact, Tanya's sister Irina was not coming to the wedding at all. She still nursed a vendetta against the werewolves for killing her friend Laurent (just as he was about to kill me). Thanks to that grudge, the Denalis had abandoned Edward's family in their worst hour of need. It had been the unlikely alliance with the Quileute wolves that had saved all our lives when the horde of newborn vampires had attacked…</div>

<div class="line_en">Carlisle had explained Tanya's history during one of the many nights I'd stayed late at the Cullens' home, learning as much as I could, preparing as much as was possible for the future I'd chosen. Tanya's mother's story was one among many, a cautionary tale illustrating just one of the rules I would need to be aware of when I joined the immortal world. Only one rule, actually -- one law that broke down into a thousand different facets: Keep the secret.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在某个我在卡伦家逗留到很晚的夜里，卡莱尔向我诉说了坦尼娅的过去。我尽可能多得去了解，来为我所选择的将来做好充分的准备。有许多警世传说就是为了证明一条我在加入吸血鬼世界后必须牢记的铁律，Tanya母亲的故事就是其中一个前车之鉴。就这么一条规则——这条法律可以应用于上千种不同的实际情况——那就是：严守秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Keeping the secret meant a lot of things -- living inconspicuously like the Cullens, moving on before humans could suspect they weren't aging. Or keeping clear of humans altogether -- except at mealtime -- the way nomads like James and Victoria had lived; the way Jasper's friends, Peter and Charlotte, still lived. It meant keeping control of whatever new vampires you created, like Jasper had done when he'd lived with Maria. Like Victoria had failed to do with her newborns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="保守秘密可以有许多种方式——像卡伦家一样低调地生活着，在人们怀疑他们并不会老去之前就搬走。或者完全和人类划清界限，就像詹姆斯和维多利亚这样游牧地生活，当然觅食期间除外，目前贾斯帕的朋友，彼得和夏洛特仍然这样生活着。这意味着控制每一个你所创造出的新吸血鬼，当贾斯帕和玛丽亚生活在一起时他做到了这一点，但是维多利亚却失败了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd flinched as I always did at that name, but of course the legion of Italian vampires -- royalty in their own estimation -- was central to this story. There couldn't be a law if there was no punishment; there couldn't be a punishment if there was no one to deliver it. The ancients Aro, Caius, and Marcus ruled the Volturi forces; I'd only met them once, but in that brief encounter, it seemed to me that Aro, with his powerful mind-reading gift -- one touch, and he knew every thought a mind had ever held -- was the true leader.</div>
