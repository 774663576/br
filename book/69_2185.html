<div class="line_en">"Are you a female Scholar?" said Lyra. She regarded female Scholars with a proper Jordan disdain: there were such people, but, poor things, they could never be taken more seriously than animals dressed up and acting a play. Mrs. Coulter, on the other hand, was not like any female Scholar Lyra had seen, and certainly not like the two serious elderly ladies who were the other female guests. Lyra had asked the question expecting the answer No, in fact, for Mrs. Coulter had such an air of glamour that Lyra was entranced. She could hardly take her eyes off her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是女院士吗？”莱拉问。她总是带着乔丹学院式的不屑来看待女院士：女院士的确存在，然而，可怜的人，人们永远也不会认真对待她们，她们只不过是些打扮起来进行表演的动物而已。然而，另一方面，库尔特夫人跟莱拉见过的女院士全都不一样，当然也不像另外两位女宾——那两位严肃的老太太。实际上，莱拉问这个问题的时候，以为她会给一个否定的答复，因为库尔特夫人的魅力已经让莱拉迷上了她，她很难把眼睛从她身上移开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within five minutes Lyra had told her everything about her half-wild life: her favorite routes over the rooftops, the battle of the claybeds, the time she and Roger had caught and roasted a rook, her intention to capture a narrowboat from the gyptians and sail it to Abingdon, and so on. She even (looking around and lowering her voice) told her about the trick she and Roger had played on the skulls in the crypt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟之内，莱拉就把自己半个野孩子的生活原原本本地告诉了她：屋顶上她喜欢走的路线、在粘土河床上打架、她和罗杰抓了一只乌鸦并把它烤了、她打算从吉卜赛人手里抢一条小河船并把它开到阿宾登去，等等，她甚至（四周张望了一下，然后压低了声音）还把自己和罗杰跟地下墓室里的头盖骨搞的恶作剧也告诉了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope you'll sit next to me at dinner," said Mrs. Coulter, making room for Lyra on the sofa. "I'm not used to the grandeur of a Master's lodging. You'll have to show me which knife and fork to use."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“希望在晚宴上你能坐在我旁边，”库尔特夫人说着，给莱拉在沙发上腾出点儿地方，“院长这么豪华的房子，我还不大习惯，你得教教我该用哪副刀叉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那些鬼就来了，真的，她们到了我的床边，全都没有脑袋！他们没法说话，只能发出一种汩汩的声音，但是我知道他们想干什么。所以，我第二天就跑到地下室，把他们的小牌牌放回到原来的地方，要不然他们也许会杀了我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It's probably better if I just go on living at Jordan and getting educated by the Scholars here when they've got a bit of spare time. Being as they're here already, they're probably free."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉显得心不在焉。“不知道——我不知道，”她说。“也许不会，”为了稳妥起见，她又补充了一个依据，“因为我不想给他们添麻烦，”她一脸虔诚地继续说，“也不想让他们破费。我继续住在乔丹学院，院士们不忙的时候，我可以在这里接受他们的教育，也许这样更好。因为他们既然在这里了，那他们可能还是有时间的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're not afraid of danger, then?" said Mrs. Coulter admiringly. They were at dinner by this time, and as Lyra had hoped, sitting next to each other. Lyra ignored completely the Librarian on her other side and spent the whole meal talking to Mrs. Coulter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你是不害怕危险的了？”库尔特夫人钦佩地说。这时，晚宴已经开始了。正如莱拉所希望的那样，她们俩坐在一起。莱拉对坐在自己另一边的图书馆长完全不理不睬，整个晚宴期间一直都在跟库尔特夫人说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉感到非常惊讶，两位女院士微微直起了身子，但她们的精灵只是相互瞥了一眼——不知道是出于礼貌还是因为反应迟钝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was it; nothing and no one else existed now for Lyra. She gazed at Mrs. Coulter with awe, and listened rapt and silent to her tales of igloo building, of seal hunting, of negotiating with the Lapland witches. The two female Scholars had nothing so exciting to tell, and sat in silence until the men came in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这正是莱拉想听的！对莱拉来说，其他任何事情、任何人都不存在了。她带着敬畏，直勾勾地盯着库尔特夫人，安安静静、聚精会神地听她讲爱斯基摩人的圆顶小屋、猎杀海豹以及跟拉普兰女巫谈判的故事。那两位女院士没有如此令人激动的事情，便默默地坐着。后来，男士们走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Puzzled, tired, exhilarated, Lyra did as he told her. Cousins the manservant showed her in, and pointedly left the door open so that he could see what she was up to from the hall, where he was helping people on with their coats. Lyra watched for Mrs. Coulter, but she didn't see her, and then the Master came into the study and shut the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉虽然感到困惑，也有点儿累，但也很兴奋，她照他的吩咐留了下来。院长的贴身男仆卡曾斯把她领进书房，然后故意开着门，这样，虽然他在走廊里帮别人披大衣，也能看见莱拉的一举一动。莱拉搜寻着库尔特夫人，可是没有找到。这时，院长走进了书房，关上了门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“她很出色。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He sat down heavily in the armchair by the fireplace. His daemon flapped up to the chair back and sat by his head, her old hooded eyes on Lyra. The lamp hissed gently as the Master said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他费力地坐在壁炉边的一把太师椅上。他的精灵拍打着翅膀，飞到椅背上，坐在院长的脑袋旁边，那双老眼耷拉着两个眼袋，看着莱拉。在灯火轻轻的咝咝声中，院长开口说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Master sighed. In his black suit and black tie he looked as much like his daemon as anyone could, and suddenly Lyra thought that one day, quite soon, he would be buried in the crypt under the oratory, and an artist would engrave a picture of his daemon on the brass plate for his coffin, and her name would share the space with his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院长叹了口气。同别人一样，穿着黑西装、打着黑领带的他跟自己的精灵再相像不过了。莱拉忽然想到，总有那么一天，而且很快，他就会被葬在教堂下面的墓室里，一位艺术家会在一张黄铜牌上刻上他的精灵的像，放在他的棺材上，他们俩的名字会被刻在同一个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I should have made time before now for a talk with you, Lyra," he said after a few moments. "I was intending to do so in any case, but it seems that time is further on than I thought. You have been safe here in Jordan, my dear. I think you've been happy. You haven't found it easy to obey us, but we are very fond of you, and you've never been a bad child. There's a lot of goodness and sweetness in your nature, and a lot of determination. You're going to need all of that. Things are going on in the wide world I would have liked to protect you from -- by keeping you here in Jordan, I mean -- but that's no longer possible."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“莱拉，我早就该找时间和你谈谈，”停了片刻之后，他说，“不管怎么说，我一直有这个打算，可时间似乎总是不如我想的那么多。亲爱的，你在乔丹学院一直是安全的，我想你也感到快乐。你觉得听我们的话不容易，但是我们十分喜欢你，你从来就不是个坏孩子。在你的天性中，你有很多善良、可爱的地方，而且在很多时候非常果断。这些你都会需要的。在广阔的世界中，正在发生着一些事情，我不想让你卷到里面去——我的意思是，就是把你留在乔丹学院——但是现在，这再也不可能了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You knew that sometime you'd have to go to school," the Master went on. "We have taught you some things here, but not well or systematically. Our knowledge is of a different kind. You need to know things that elderly men are not able to teach you, especially at the age you are now. You must have been aware of that. You're not a servant's child either; we couldn't put you out to be fostered by a town family. They might have cared for you in some ways, but your needs are different. You see, what I'm saying to you, Lyra, is that the part of your life that belongs to Jordan college is coming to an end."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道你总得上学，”院长继续说，“我们在这里已经教了你些东西，但效果不好，也缺乏系统性。我们掌握的是另一类不同的知识，而你需要了解的知识，老人们却教不了你，特别是在你现在这个年龄。这一点你一定是知道的。你也不是仆人家的孩子，我们不能把你寄养在城里的某个家庭里。在某些方面，他们也许会关心你，但是你需要的并不是这些。你看，我要对你说的是，莱拉，你生活中属于乔丹学院的那一部分就要结束了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Overhead the last stars were still visible, but the light from the east was gradually soaking into the sky above the Hall. Lyra ran into the Library garden, and stood for a moment in the immense hush, looking up at the stone pinnacles of the chapel, the pearl-green cupola of the Sheldon Building, the white-painted lantern of the Library.

Lyra was intoxicated; not about the North this time, but about London, and the restaurants and ballrooms, the soirees at embassies or ministries, the intrigues between White Hall and Westminster.

<div class="line_en">Then a bath, with thick scented foam. Mrs. Coulter came into the bathroom to wash Lyra's hair, and she didn't rub and scrape like Mrs. Lonsdale either. She was gentle. Pantalaimon watched with powerful curiosity until Mrs. Coulter looked at him, and he knew what she meant and turned away, averting his eyes modestly from these feminine mysteries as the golden monkey was doing. He had never had to look away from Lyra before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着是洗澡，用的是散发着香味的浓浓的浴泡。库尔特夫人进来给莱拉洗头，她也没有像朗斯代尔太太那样使劲搓刮，而是非常轻柔。潘特莱蒙非常好奇地注视着这些，后来库尔特夫人看着他，他明白她是什么意思，便把脸别转过去，跟那只金猴一样小心翼翼地让自己的眼睛躲着这些女性的神秘。以前，他可从来没有这样做过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no point in asking what that meant. It lay heavily in her hands, the crystal face gleaming, the golden body exquisitely machined. It was very like a clock, or a compass, for there were hands pointing to places around the dial, but instead of the hours or the points of the compass there were several little pictures, each of them painted with extraordinary precision, as if on ivory with the finest and slenderest sable brush. She turned the dial around to look at them all. There was an anchor; an hourglass surmounted by a skull; a chameleon, a bull, a beehive… Thirty-six altogether, and she couldn't even guess what they meant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问这名字是什么意思，是没有任何意义的。它在她的手上沉甸甸的，水晶做的表壳闪着光芒，金色的机身制作得非常精致。它很像钟或罗盘，因为上面有指针指向表盘周围的刻度，但上面刻的不是时间，也不是罗盘上的点，而是几张小图片，每一张都画得极其精细，像是用最好、最细的黑貂毫笔在象牙上画出来的。她把表盘翻来覆去地转转，想看看上面都有些什么。那上面画了一只锚，还有一个沙漏，它们的上方则是一个头盖骨、一条变色龙、一头公牛、一个蜂窝…一共是三十六种东西。莱拉猜不出这些是什么意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew at once what he meant.

<div class="line_en">There were three little knurled winding wheels, in fact, and each of them turned one of the three shorter hands, which moved around the dial in a series of smooth satisfying clicks. You could arrange them to point at any of the pictures, and once they had clicked into position, pointing exactly at the center of each one, they would not move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上面有三个滚花小轮，实际上，每个轮子都可以用来拨动三个较短的指针中的一个，这些指针可以绕着表盘平稳移动，发出有力的喀哒声。你可以把它们拨到任意一张图片上，一旦它们喀哒喀哒地走到预定的位置，便会精确地指向每个图片的中央，这时候它们就再也不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fourth hand was longer and more slender, and seemed to be made of a duller metal than the other three. Lyra couldn't control its movement at all; it swung where it wanted to, like a compass needle, except that it didn't settle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第四个指针更长一些，也更细，好像是由一种比其他三个指针更钝的金属制成的。至于它的运动，莱拉一点儿也控制不了，它总是回到自己的位置，有点儿像罗盘上的指针，只是它总是固定不下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Meter means measure," said Pantalaimon. "Like thermometer. The Chaplain told us that."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，可是这个比较容易，”莱拉小声应道，“你觉得它是干什么用的呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Neither of them could guess. Lyra spent a long time turning the hands to point at one symbol or another (angel, helmet, dolphin; globe, lute, compasses; candle, thunderbolt, horse) and watching the long needle swing on its never-ceasing errant way, and although she understood nothing, she was intrigued and delighted by the complexity and the detail. Pantalaimon became a mouse to get closer to it, and rested his tiny paws on the edge, his button eyes bright black with curiosity as he watched the needle swing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们俩谁都猜不出来。有好一阵儿，莱拉不断地把三个指针拨到某个记号那儿（天使、头盔、海豚，地球、鲁特琴、圆规，蜡烛、闪电、马匹），看着那根长指针永无休止、漫无目的地摆来摆去。尽管她什么都不明白，但它的复杂和精细还是让她非常好奇，也非常兴奋。为了凑得更近一些，潘特莱蒙变成一只老鼠，小爪子趴着真理仪的边，两只圆眼睛又黑又亮，好奇地盯着摆来摆去的指针。">查看中文翻译</div>
