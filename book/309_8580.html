<div class="line_en">She loved her papa, Hans Hubermann, and even her foster mother, despite the abusages and verbal assaults. She loved and hated her best friend, Rudy Steiner, which was perfectly normal. And she loved the fact that despite her failure in the classroom, her reading and writing were definitely improving and would soon be on the verge of something respectable. All of this resulted in at least some form of contentment and would soon be built upon to approach the concept of Being Happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">She gulped the air until she was ready, and they began reading from the eleventh chapter of The Grave Digger's Handbook. Just past three o'clock, they finished it, and only the final chapter, "Respecting the Graveyard," remained. Papa, his silver eyes swollen in their tiredness and his face awash with whiskers, shut the book and expected the leftovers of his sleep. He didn't get them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一直做着深呼吸，直到情绪稳定下来，然后他们从《掘墓人手册》的第十一章读起。刚过三点，他们就读完了这一章，只剩下最后一章“尊重墓地”。爸爸银色的眼睛疲倦而浮肿，他的脸上也胡子拉碴的。他合上书，希望能用余下的夜晚补补觉。可是他没能如愿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They read through the early hours of morning, circling and writing the words she did not comprehend and turning the pages toward daylight. A few times, Papa nearly slept, succumbing to the itchy fatigue in his eyes and the wilting of his head. Liesel caught him out on each occasion, but she had neither the selflessness to allow him to sleep nor the hide to be offended. She was a girl with a mountain to climb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从凌晨读到了早上，爸爸一边读一边把她不理解的词圈出来，写下来。有好几次，爸爸都快睡着了，他的眼皮越来越疲倦，头也越来越沉。他每次打瞌睡，莉泽尔都察觉到了，但她既没有无私到让他去睡觉，也没有因此而生气。这个女孩面前可是有一座山峰要征服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Liesel, half-wrapped in blanket, studied the black book in her hand and its silver lettering. She nodded, dry-mouthed and early-morning hungry. It was one of those moments of perfect tiredness, of having conquered not only the work at hand, but the night who had blocked the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔身上半盖着毯子，正端详着手里黑色的书和那银色的书名。她点了点头，嘴巴干涩，没吃早饭的肚子也饿得很。此时她疲劳到了极点，不仅是因为攻克了手头的任务，还因为他们熬了整整一夜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Papa stretched with his fists closed and his eyes grinding shut, and it was a morning that didn't dare to be rainy.

<div class="line_en">Liesel still held the book. She gripped it tighter as the snow turned orange. On one of the rooftops, she could see a small boy, sitting, looking at the sky. "His name was Werner," she mentioned. The words trotted out, involuntarily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔手里依然拿着书。当积雪由粉色变成橙色时，她的手握得更紧了。她看见一个小男孩坐在屋顶上，抬头望着天空。“他叫维尔纳。”她不自觉地脱口而出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look at the colors," Papa said. It's hard not to like a man who not only notices the colors, but speaks them.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸说：“是的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At school during that time, there had been no more reading tests, but as Liesel slowly gathered confidence, she did pick up a stray textbook before class one morning to see if she could read it without trouble. She could read every word, but she remained stranded at a much slower pace than that of her classmates. It's much easier, she realized, to be on the verge of something than to actually be it. This would still take time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那段时间，学校没有安排阅读测验，不过莉泽尔渐渐对自己有了信心。一天上午，她随意地拿起一本课本，想看看自己能不能顺利地读下来。她能读懂每一个词，但阅读速度仍然比同学们差了一大截。这让她意识到，从快要做成一件事到真正做成一件事，中间还需要很多努力。她还需要一些时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One afternoon, she was tempted to steal a book from the class bookshelf, but frankly, the prospect of another corridor Watschen at the hands of Sister Maria was a powerful enough deterrent. On top of that, there was actually no real desire in her to take the books from school. It was most likely the intensity of her November failure that caused this lack of interest, but Liesel wasn't sure. She only knew that it was there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，她心痒难耐，想从教室的书架上偷本书，但是说实话，这样做会被玛丽亚修女体罚，想到这一点，莉泽尔便退缩了。除此之外，她也不想把学校的课本带回家。也许是因为十一月的失败太过惨重，让她没了兴趣，莉泽尔心里也不太确定。她只是明白心中有偷书的欲望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When school broke up briefly for Weihnachten, Liesel even afforded Sister Maria a "merry Christmas" before going on her way. Knowing that the Hubermanns were essentially broke, still paying off debts and paying rent quicker than the money could come in, she was not expecting a gift of any sort. Perhaps only some better food. To her surprise, on Christmas Eve, after sitting in church at midnight with Mama, Papa, Hans Junior, and Trudy, she came home to find something wrapped in newspaper under the Christmas tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞节放假的那天，莉泽尔甚至在回家前向玛丽亚修女道了一句“圣诞快乐”。她心里明白，胡伯曼家一贫如洗，赚钱的速度赶不上还债和付房租的速度，所以她并不指望能收到礼物。也许会吃得好一些吧。平安夜，她和爸爸妈妈、小汉斯，还有特鲁迪在教堂里一直坐到午夜。回到家，她惊喜地发现圣诞树下竟然摆着用报纸包着的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"From Saint Niklaus," Papa said, but the girl was not fooled. She hugged both her foster parents, with snow still laid across her shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">As winter set in, she was no longer a victim of Sister Maria's frustrations, preferring to watch as others were marched out to the corridor and given their just rewards. The sound of another student struggling in the hallway was not particularly enjoyable, but the fact that it was someone else was, if not a true comfort, a relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着冬天的来临，她已不再是玛丽亚修女的出气筒，她喜欢看着别人被勒令站到走廊上接受他们应得的“奖赏”。听别人在走廊里挣扎的声音并不怎么好玩，可一想到那个人不是自己，就算说不上是慰藉，至少也是一种解脱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, they read some more in bed, adhering to the tradition of circling the words she didn't know and writing them down. Faust the Dog also had pictures -- lovely curves and ears and caricatures of a German Shepherd with an obscene drooling problem and the ability to talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜半时分，他们在床上继续读书，像过去那样把她不懂的单词圈出来，写下来。《小狗浮士德》里面还有图片，画着德国牧羊犬可爱的身形和漂亮的耳朵，这条小狗会说话，还老流口水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfurling the paper, she unwrapped two small books. The first one, Faust the Dog, was written by a man named Mattheus Ottleberg. All told, she would read that book thirteen times. On Christmas Eve, she read the first twenty pages at the kitchen table while Papa and Hans Junior argued about a thing she did not understand. Something called politics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拆开报纸后，她从里面拿出了两本小书。第一本是《小狗浮士德》，作者叫马托伊斯·奥特利伯格。这本书她要读上十三遍。那个平安夜，她在餐桌边读了二十页，而爸爸和小汉斯为一个她听不懂的东西起了争执。那个东西叫政治。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second book was called The Lighthouse and was written by a woman, Ingrid Rippinstein. That particular book was a little longer, so Liesel was able to get through it only nine times, her pace increasing ever so slightly by the end of such prolific readings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二本书是《灯塔》，作者是英格丽德·里皮施泰因，是位女作家。这本书要稍微厚一点，所以莉泽尔只读了九遍。虽然读了那么多遍，她的读书速度却没有多少长进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a few days after Christmas that she asked a question regarding the books. They were eating in the kitchen. Looking at the spoonfuls of pea soup entering Mama's mouth, she decided to shift her focus to Papa. "There's something I need to ask."</div>
