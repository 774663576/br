<div class="line_en">There was no sound at all. I was aware of the same musty, unused smell that had been before. I was uncertain which way to go. The plan of the rooms was not familiar to me. I remembered then that last time Mrs Danvers had come out of a door here, just behind me, and it seemed to me that the position of the room would make it the one I wanted, whose windows looked out upon the lawns to the sea. I turned the handle of the door and went inside. It was dark of course, because of the shutters. I felt for the electric light switch on the wall and turned it on. I was standing in a little ante-room, a dressing-room I judged, with big wardrobes round the wall, and at the end of this room was another door, open, leading to a larger room. I went through to this room, and turned on the light. My first impression was one of shock because the room was fully furnished, as though in use.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had expected to see chairs and tables swathed in dust-sheets, and dust-sheets too over the great double bed against the wall. Nothing was covered up. There were brushes and combs on the dressing-table, scent, and powder. The bed was made up, I saw the gleam of white linen on the pillow-case, and the tip of a blanket beneath the quilted coverlet. There were flowers on the dressing-table and on the table beside the bed. Flowers too on the carved mantelpiece. A satin dressing-gown lay on a chair, and a pair of bedroom slippers beneath. For one desperate moment I thought that something had happened to my brain, that I was seeing back into Time, and looking upon the room as it used to be, before she died… In a minute Rebecca herself would come back into the room, sit down before the looking-glass at her dressing-table, humming a tune, reach for her comb and run it through her hair. If she sat there I should see her reflection in the glass and she would see me too, standing like this by the door. Nothing happened. I went on standing there, waiting for something to happen. It was the clock ticking on the wall that brought me to reality again. The hands stood at twenty-five past four. My watch said the same. There was something sane and comforting about the ticking of the clock. It reminded me of the present, and that tea would soon be ready for me on the lawn. I walked slowly into the middle of the room. No, it was not used. It was not lived in any more. Even the flowers could not destroy the musty smell. The curtains were drawn and the shutters were closed. Rebecca would never come back to the room again. Even if Mrs Danvers did put the flowers on the mantelpiece and the sheets upon the bed, they would not bring her back. She was dead. She had been dead now for a year. She lay buried in the crypt of the church with all the other dead de Winters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我原以为桌子、椅子，还有靠墙的那张大双人床，全都会被罩单蒙着，不料什么也没过没。梳妆台上放着发刷、梳子、香水和脂粉。床也铺得平整，还可以看到雪白的枕套和夹层床罩下面露出的一角毛毯。梳妆台和床头柜上都放有鲜花。雕花的壁炉架上也摆着鲜花。靠椅上放着一件缎子晨衣，下面搁一双卧室里穿的拖鞋。有那么一刹那的工夫，我脑子突然一阵迷离，仿佛时光又倒退了回去。而自己是在她犹未去世时打量这房间的…过了一会儿，吕蓓卡本人就会回屋来，哼着小调，在梳妆台的镜子面前坐定，伸手去拿梳子，然后梳理头发。要是也坐在那儿，我就可以看到她在镜子里的映像，而她也会从镜子里看到我这么站在门口。这一切当然都没出现。我还是呆呆地站在那儿，期待着发生什么事。倒是墙上挂钟的滴答声，把我重新唤回现实生活。钟上的针臂指着四点二十五分，跟我手表指示的时间相符。时钟的滴答声，听了使人恢复正常的神智，感到宽心。它提醒我别忘了现在，别忘了茶点马上就会在草坪那儿摆开，等我去享用。我慢慢走到房间中央。不，这房间现在没人使用，没有人再住在这儿。就是那些鲜花，也驱散不了屋里的霉味。窗帘拉得严实，百叶窗关得紧紧的。吕蓓卡不会再回这儿来了。即使丹弗斯太太在壁炉架上摆了鲜花，在床上铺好被单，也没法再把她招回来。她死了，离开人世已一年。她躺在教堂的墓地里，跟德温特家的其他死者葬在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could hear the sound of the sea very plainly. I went to the window and swung back the shutter. Yes, I was standing at the same window where Favell and Mrs Danvers had stood, half an hour ago. The long shaft of daylight made the electric light look false and yellow. I opened the shutter a little more. The daylight cast a white beam upon the bed. It shone upon the nightdress-case, lying on the pillow. It shone on the glass top of the dressing-table, on the brushes, and on the scent bottles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="涛声清晰可闻。我走到窗前拉起百叶窗。不错，我现在站着的这个窗口，正是半小时前费弗尔和丹弗斯太太呆过的地方。白昼的一道道光线射进房来。使电灯光顿时显得昏黄而悠忽。我把百叶窗再拉开些。一束明亮的日光投射在床上，于是，搁在枕头上的睡衣套袋、梳妆台顶上的玻璃镜面、发刷和香水瓶，全都豁然明亮起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The daylight gave an even greater air of reality to the room. When the shutter was closed and it had been lit by electricity the room had more the appearance of a setting on the stage. The scene set between performances. The curtain having fallen for the night, the evening over, and the first act set for tomorrow's matinee. But the daylight made the room vivid and alive. I forgot the musty smell and the drawn curtains of the other windows. I was a guest again. An uninvited guest. I had strolled into my hostess's bedroom by mistake. Those were her brushes on the dressing-table, that was her dressing-gown and slippers laid out upon the chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日光给了屋子以更强烈的现实感。百叶窗关着的时候，屋子在灯光下倒更似舞台上的布景，像是两场戏之间布置就绪的场景。夜戏已幕落，今晚的演出就此收场，舞台上换上第二天日戏第一幕的布景。而日光却使整个房间栩栩如生，气象盎然。我忘了屋子的霉味，忘了另外几扇窗户的帷帘仍未拉起。我又成了个客人，一个不请自来的客人，闲逛之中误闯了女主人的卧室。梳妆台上是她的发刷，搁在靠椅那边的是她的晨衣和拖鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I realized for the first time since I had come into the room that my legs were trembling, weak as straw. I sat down on the stool by the dressing-table. My heart no longer beat in a strange excited way. It felt as heavy as lead. I looked about me in the room with a sort of dumb stupidity. Yes, it was a beautiful room. Mrs Danvers had not exaggerated that first evening. It was the most beautiful room in the house. That exquisite mantelpiece, the ceiling, the carved bedstead, and the curtain hangings, even the clock on the wall and the candlesticks upon the dressing-table beside me, all were things I would have loved and almost worshipped had they been mine. They were not mine though. They belonged to somebody else. I put out my hand and touched the brushes. One was more worn than its fellow. I understood it well. There was always one brush that had the greater use. Often you forgot to use the other, and when they were taken to be washed there was one that was still quite clean and untouched. How white and thin my face looked in the glass, my hair hanging lank and straight. Did I always look like this? Surely I had more colour as a rule? The reflection stared back at me, sallow and plain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进入这屋子之后，我还是第一次感到双腿发软，不住打颤。我只得在梳妆台前的凳子上坐下。我的心不再因感到异样的兴奋而剧烈跳动，倒是沉重得像压上了铅块。我发着呆，出神地在屋子里东张西望。不错，这是个漂亮的房间。在我刚到的那天晚上，丹弗斯太太的介绍并非言过其实，这个房间确是整幢宅子最漂亮的一间。瞧那精致的壁炉架，那天花板，那雕花的床架，那窗帷的流苏，还有那墙上的挂钟和身旁梳妆台上的烛台，所有这一切如果是属于我的，我一定会奉若至宝，爱不释手。可这些东西不是我的，而是属于另一个人。我伸手摸摸那一对发刷。一把比较旧些。这道理我是明白的，人们往往尽顾着用一把发刷，忘了另一把，所以把发刷拿去洗的时候，其中一把还是干干净净，简直没怎么用过。瞧瞧镜子里自己的脸，多苍白，多消瘦，一头平直难看的长发就这么拖着。难道我一直就是这副鬼样子？往日里，脸色总比现在红润些吧？镜子里的那个人，满面菜色，姿色平平，直愣愣地朝我干瞪着眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I got up from the stool and went and touched the dressing-gown on the chair. I picked up the slippers and held them in my hand. I was aware of a growing sense of horror, of horror turning to despair. I touched the quilt on the bed, traced with my fingers the monogram on the nightdress case, R de W, interwoven and interlaced. The letters were corded and strong against the golden satin material. The nightdress was inside the case, thin as gossamer, apricot in colour. I touched it, drew it out from the case, put it against my face. It was cold, quite cold. But there was a dim mustiness about it still where the scent had been. The scent of the white azaleas. I folded it, and put it back into the case, and as I did so I noticed with a sick dull aching in my heart that there were creases in the nightdress, the texture was ruffled, it had not been touched or laundered since it was last worn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站直身，走到靠椅边，摸了摸椅子上的晨衣，又捡起拖鞋拿在手中，一阵恐惧之感猛地袭上心头，越来越强烈，接着又渐渐演化为绝望。我摸摸床上的被褥，手指顺着睡衣套袋上字母图案的笔划移动着，图案是由“R—德温特”这几个字样相互迭合交织而成的。凸花字母绣在金色的缎面上，挺硬挣的。套袋里的那件睡衣呈杏黄色，薄如蝉翼。我摸着摸着，就把它从套袋里抽出来，贴在自己面颊上。衣服凉冰冰，原先一定芬芳沁人，散发着白杜鹃的幽香，可是现在却隐隐约约透出一股霉味。我把睡衣折叠好，重新放回套袋，我一边这么做，一边感到心头隐隐作痛；我注意到睡衣上有几条折痕，光滑的织纹陡然起了皱，可见从上回穿过以后一直没人碰过，也没有送去洗熨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On a sudden impulse I moved away from the bed and went back to the little ante-room where I had seen the wardrobes. I opened one of them. It was as I thought. The wardrobe was full of clothes. There were evening dresses here, I caught the shimmer of silver over the top of the white bags that enfolded them. There was a piece of gold brocade. There, next to it, was velvet, wine-coloured and soft. There was attain of white satin, dripping on the floor of the wardrobe. Peeping out from a piece of tissue paper on a shelf above was an ostrich feather fan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我猛然一阵冲动，情不自禁地从床边走开，返身回进那间小小的前室，刚才我看到那儿放着好几口衣柜。我打开其中的一口。不出所料，里面挂满了衣服。这里放的是礼服。衣服用白布袋包着，我看到布袋的袋口上方闪着银光，原来是件金黄色的织锦缎礼服。旁边是件颜色淡黄、质地柔软的丝绒外衣，另外还有条白缎子长裙，裙据一直拖到衣柜的底板，上层的架子上有把鸵毛扇，从一张包装薄纸底下探出头来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，我听见背后有脚步声，回头一看，是丹弗斯太太。她脸上的那副表情，我这辈子再也忘不了。得意洋洋、幸灾乐祸的神气之中，夹杂着一种奇怪的病态激动。我吓得魂不附体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you feeling unwell?" she said, coming nearer to me, speaking very softly. I backed away from her. I believe if she had come any closer to me I should have fainted. I felt her breath on my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您觉得不舒服吧？”她说。口气极其温和。她朝我走过来。我往后退，想避开她。我相信她要是再朝我逼近一步，我一定会昏厥过去。我感到她的鼻息已经喷到我的脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wardrobe smelt stuffy, queer. The azalea scent, so fragrant and delicate in the air, had turned stale inside the wardrobe, tarnishing the silver dresses and the brocade, and the breath of it wafted towards me now from the open doors, faded and old. I shut the doors. I went back into the bedroom once again. The gleam of light from the shutter still shone white and clear on the golden coverlet of the bed, picking out clearly and distinctly the tall sloping R of the monogram.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="衣柜由于密不通风而积有一股怪味。杜鹃花在户外清香宜人，可是这种香气闷在衣柜里，不但走了味，而且使绫罗、锦缎都失去了光泽。这时，一阵阵变了味的杜鹃花陈香就从敞开着的衣柜门里向我袭来。我关上衣柜门，重又走进卧室。窗口射进清澈明亮的日光，仍然在金色的床罩上，那字母图案中高大的斜体R字母，在日光下显得格外耀眼，轮廓分明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么，丹弗斯太太，”我过了一会才说。“我没有想到会在这儿看到你。事情是这样的：我刚才在草坪上偶尔抬头朝窗子看了一眼，注意到有一扇百叶窗没关严。我上来看看是不是能把它关严实。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She took the nightdress from the case and held it before me. "Feel it, hold it," she said, "how soft and light it is, isn't it? I haven't washed it since she wore it for the last time. I put it out like this, and the dressing-gown and slippers, just as I put them out for her the night she never came back, the night she was drowned." She folded up the nightgown and put it back in the case. "I did everything for her, you know," she said, taking my arm again, leading me to the dressing-gown and slippers. "We tried maid after maid but not one of them suited. 'You maid me better than anyone, Danny,' she used to say, 'I won't have anyone but you.' Look, this is her dressing-gown. She was much taller than you, you can see by the length. Put it up against you. It comes down to your ankles. She had a beautiful figure. These are her slippers.

<div class="line_en">She put the slippers back on the floor, and laid the dressing-gown on the chair. "You've seen her brushes, haven't you?" she said, taking me to the dressing-table; "there they are, just as she used them, unwashed and untouched. I used to brush her hair for her every evening. 'Come on, Danny, hair-drill,' she would say, and I'd stand behind her by the stool here, and brush away for twenty minutes at a time. She only wore it short the last few years, you know. It came down below the waist, when she was first married. Mr de Winter used to brush it for her then. I've come into this room time and time again and seen him, in his shirt sleeves, with the two brushes in his hand. 'Harder, Max, harder,' she would say, laughing up at him, and he would do as she told him. They would be dressing for dinner, you see, and the house filled with guests. 'Here, I shall be late,' he would say, throwing the brushes to me, and laughing back at her. He was always laughing and gay then." She paused, her hand still resting on my arm.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“听说那幅画是那一年的最佳作品，”她继续往下说。“可是德温特先生不喜欢那画，不准在曼陀丽挂出来。我想，大概他认为那画不传神，没有充分显示出她的风韵吧。您想看看她的衣服，是吗？”她不等我回答就把我领到那间小前室，把衣柜一口一口打开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Everyone was angry with her when she cut her hair," she said, "but she did not care. 'It's nothing to do with anyone but myself,' she would say.

<div class="line_en">"I keep her furs in here," she said, "the moths have not got to them yet, and I doubt if they ever will. I'm too careful. Feel that sable wrap. That was a Christmas present from Mr de Winter. She told me the cost once, but I've forgotten it now. This chinchilla she wore in the evenings mostly. Round her shoulders, very often, when the evenings were cold. This wardrobe here is full of her evening clothes. You opened it, didn't you? The latch is not quite closed. I believe Mr de Winter liked her to wear silver mostly. But of course she could wear anything, stand any colour. She looked beautiful in this velvet. Put it against your face. It's soft, isn't it? You can feel it, can't you? The scent is still fresh, isn't it? You could almost imagine she had only just taken it off. I would always know when she had been before me in a room. There would be a little whiff of her scent in the room. These are her underclothes, in this drawer. This pink set here she had never worn. She was wearing slacks of course and a shirt when she died. They were torn from her body in the water though. There was nothing on the body when it was found, all those weeks afterwards."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我把她的毛皮衣饰都放在这里，”她说。“这些皮毛还没蛀掉，我想以后也不会蛀掉。我总是很当心的。您摸摸那条黑貂皮围脖。那是德温特先生送给她的圣诞节礼物。也曾告诉过我这玩意儿值多少钱，可我现在已忘了。这栗鼠皮披肩是她晚上最常用的。寒风凛冽的夜晚，她常用它裹住肩头。这口柜子里放的都是她的夜礼服。您打开过了，是吗？您把没插销完全闩牢呢。我相信德温特先生最喜欢她穿银白色的礼服，当然，她不管穿什么都行，不管穿什么颜色都好看。她穿着这件丝绒礼服真是仪态万方。把它贴在脸上试试，很柔软，是吗？您不会不感觉到吧！温馨犹在，对吗？您简直会觉得这是她刚从身上脱下来的呢。凡是她到过的房间，我总可以一下子辨出来。屋里会留下她的几缕余香。这个抽屉里放的是她的内衣。这套粉红色的内衣她从来没穿过。她死的时候，当然穿着便裤和衬衫，不过后来被海水冲掉了。几星期以后找到她尸体的时候，身上什么也没留下。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her fingers tightened on my arm. She bent down to me, her skull's face close, her dark eyes searching mine. "The rocks had battered her to bits, you know," she whispered, "her beautiful face unrecognizable, and both arms gone. Mr de Winter identified her. He went up to Edgecoombe to do it.

<div class="line_en">She paused, her eyes never leaving my face. "I shall always blame myself for the accident," she said, "it was my fault for being out that evening. I had gone into Kerrith for the afternoon and stayed there late, as Mrs de Winter was up in London and not expected back until much later. That's why I did not hurry back. When I came in, about half past nine, I heard she had returned just before seven, had her dinner, and then went out again. Down to the beach of course. I felt worried then. It was blowing from the south-west. She would never have gone if I'd been in. She always listened to me. 'I wouldn't go out this evening, it's not fit,' I should have said, and she would have answered me 'All right, Danny, you old fuss-pot.' And we would have sat up here talking no doubt, she telling me all she had done in London, like she always did."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她停了片刻，可是目光始终盯着我的脸不移开去。“出了这件意外，我永远不能原谅自己，”她说。“全怪我那天晚上不在家。下午我到克里斯去了，而且在那儿耽搁很久；德温特夫人上伦敦去了，不到深夜是不会回来的。所以我也就不急着回来。等我九点半光景回到庄园，听人说她七点不到就已经回来，吃过晚饭，又出去了。当然是到海滩去了，我很担心，那时已起了西南风。要是我当时在家，她就不会出去。她总是听我的话。‘换了我，今儿个晚上才不高兴出去呢，这种天气不宜出门哪！’我会这么对她说；而她呢，也会回答我说，‘好吧，丹尼，你这个爱大惊小怪的老太婆。’于是，不用说，我们就会坐在这儿，促膝谈心，她呢，会像以往那样把她在伦敦的所见所闻，一五一十地说给我听。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mr de Winter had been dining with Mr Crawley down at his house," she went on. "I don't know what time he got back, I dare say it was after eleven. But it began to blow quite hard just before midnight, and she had not come back. I went downstairs, but there were no lights under the library door. I came upstairs again and knocked on the dressing-room door. Mr de Winter answered at once, 'Who is it, what do you want?' he said. I told him I was worried about Mrs de Winter not being back. He waited a moment, and then he came and opened the door in his dressing-gown. 'She's spending the night down at the cottage I expect,' he said. 'I should go to bed if I were you. She won't come back here to sleep if it goes on like this.' He looked tired, and I did not like to disturb him. After all, she spent many nights at the cottage, and had sailed in every sort of weather. She might not even have gone for a sail, but just wanted the night at the cottage as a change after London. I said good night to Mr de Winter and went back to my room. I did not sleep though. I kept wondering what she was doing."</div>

It was getting light, but there was still a misty sort of rain falling, although the wind had dropped. When I got to the beach I saw the buoy there in the water and the dinghy, but the boat had gone…" It seemed to me that I could see the cove in the grey morning light, feel the thin drizzle on my face, and peering through the mist could make out, shadowy and indistinct, the low dark outline of the buoy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Danvers loosened the pressure on my arm. Her hand fell back again to her side. Her voice lost all expression, became the hard mechanical voice of every day. "One of the life-buoys was washed up at Kerrith in the afternoon," she said, "and another was found the next day by some crabbers on the rocks below the headland. Bits and pieces of rigging too would come in with the tide." She turned away from me, and closed the chest of drawers. She straightened one of the pictures on the wall. She picked up a piece of fluff from the carpet. I stood watching her, not knowing what to do.</div>
