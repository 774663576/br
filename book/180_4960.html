<div class="line_en">The sails flapped over their heads. The water chuckled and slapped the sides of the boat, which drowsed motionless in the sun. Now and then the sails rippled with a little breeze in them, but the ripple ran over them and ceased. The boat made no motion at all. Mr Ramsay sat in the middle of the boat. He would be impatient in a moment, James thought, and Cam thought, looking at her father, who sat in the middle of the boat between them (James steered; Cam sat alone in the bow) with his legs tightly curled. He hated hanging about. Sure enough, after fidgeting a second or two, he said something sharp to Macalister's boy, who got out his oars and began to row. But their father, they knew, would never be content until they were flying along. He would keep looking for a breeze, fidgeting, saying things under his breath, which Macalister and and Macalister's boy would overhear, and they would both be made horribly uncomfortable. He had made them come. He had forced them to come. In their anger they hoped that the breeze would never rise, that he might be thwarted in every possible way, since he had forced them to come against their wills.</div>

<div class="line_en">All the way down to the beach they had lagged behind together, though he bade them "Walk up, walk up," without speaking. Their heads were bent down, their heads were pressed down by some remorseless gale. Speak to him they could not. They must come; they must follow. They must walk behind him carrying brown paper parcels. But they vowed, in silence, as they walked, to stand by each other and carry out the great compact -- to resist tyranny to the death. So there they would sit, one at one end of the boat, one at the other, in silence. They would say nothing, only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs twisted, frowning and fidgeting, and pishing and pshawing and muttering things to himself, and waiting impatiently for a breeze. And they hoped it would be calm. They hoped he would be thwarted. They hoped the whole expedition would fail, and they would have to put back, with their parcels, to the beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在走下海滩去的路上他们一起落在后面，尽管父亲在无声地命令他们“走快点，走快点”。他们低着头，仿佛一阵无情的狂风压得他们抬不起头来。不可能和他谈谈。他们必须得来；他们必须照他的话办。他们必须抱着牛皮纸包跟在他身后。但是他们一面走一面默默地发誓，他们要相互支持实现那个伟大的盟约——至死反抗暴行。因此他们就那样坐着，一声不响，一个在船头，一个在船尾。他们一句话也不说，只是有时看上他一眼，见他蜷腿坐在那儿，紧皱眉头，烦躁不安，鼻子里不住地发出焦躁的哼哧声、嘴里自言自语地嘟哝，不耐烦地等着起风。而他们则希望一点风都没有，他的希望统统落空。他们希望整个的远游无法实现，不得不抱着牛皮纸包折回海滩去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But now, when Macalister's boy had rowed a little way out, the sails slowly swung round, the boat quickened itself, flattened itself, and shot off. Instantly, as if some great strain had been relieved, Mr Ramsay uncurled his legs, took out his tobacco pouch, handed it with a little grunt to Macalister, and felt, they knew, for all they suffered, perfectly content. Now they would sail on for hours like this, and Mr Ramsay would ask old Macalister a question -- about the great storm last winter probably -- and old Macalister would answer it, and they would puff their pipes together, and Macalister would take a tarry rope in his fingers, tying or untying some knot, and the boy would fish, and never say a word to any one. James would be forced to keep his eye all the time on the sail. For if he forgot, then the sail puckered and shivered, and the boat slackened, and Mr Ramsay would say sharply, "Look out! Look out!" and old Macalister would turn slowly on his seat. So they heard Mr Ramsay asking some question about the great storm at Christmas. "She comes driving round the point," old Macalister said, describing the great storm last Christmas, when ten ships had been driven into the bay for shelter, and he had seen "one there, one there, one there" (he pointed slowly round the bay. Mr Ramsay followed him, turning his head). He had seen four men clinging to the mast. Then she was gone. "And at last we shoved her off," he went on (but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word here and there, compact to fight tyranny to the death). At last they had shoved her off, they had launched the lifeboat, and they had got her out past the point -- Macalister told the story; and though they only caught a word here and there, they were conscious all the time of their father -- how he leant forward, how he brought his voice into tune with Macalister's voice; how, puffing at his pipe, and looking there and there where Macalister pointed, he relished the thought of the storm and the dark night and the fishermen striving there. He liked that men should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night; pitting muscle and brain against the waves and the wind; he liked men to work like that, and women to keep house, and sit beside sleeping children indoors, while men were drowned, out there in a storm. So James could tell, so Cam could tell (they looked at him, they looked at each other), from his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice, and the little tinge of Scottish accent which came into his voice, making him seem like a peasant himself, as he questioned Macalister about the eleven ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm. Three had sunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是现在，当麦卡利斯特的儿子划出去了一点儿以后，帆慢慢转了过来，船加快了速度，船身平稳下来后，便箭一般飞驶而去。马上拉姆齐先生仿佛卸下了重负，他伸直双腿，拿出烟叶袋，咕哝着送给了麦卡斯利特，孩子们知道，尽管他们感到痛苦，他却心满意足。现在他们会这样一连几个小时航行下去，拉姆齐先生会向老麦卡利斯特问个什么问题——可能是关于去年冬天的那场大风暴——老麦卡利斯特会回答他，他们就会一起抽烟斗，麦卡利斯特会用手指拿起一根涂过柏油的绳子或者打结或者解扣儿，他的儿子钓鱼，跟谁都不说话。詹姆斯于是将不得不把眼睛一直盯在船帆上。因为如果他忘记这样做，那么帆就会皱拢起来打颤，船的速度就会慢下来，拉姆齐先生就会厉声说，“注意！注意！老麦卡利斯特就会在座位上慢慢转过身来。就这样，他们听见拉姆齐先生问了些关于去年圣诞节那场大风暴的情况。“那条船绕过那个岬角驶来，”老麦卡利斯特说道，形容圣诞节的那场风暴。那时有十条船已经被迫开进海湾里面来避风，他看见“一条在那儿，一条在那儿，一条在那儿，”（他慢慢指着海湾各处，拉姆齐先生的脑袋跟着他的手转）。他看见有三个人紧抱着桅杆。然后那船就沉了。最后他们把船推走了，他继续说道（但是两个孩子生气地沉默着，只听见了零星的几个字，他们坐在船的两头，他们至死反抗暴行的盟约把他们团结在一起）。最后他们把船推走了，他们放下了救生艇，把她推到了岬角以外——麦卡利斯特叙述着；虽然他们只听见了片言只语，却一直意识到父亲的存在——他怎样向前探着身子，怎样使自己的声音和麦卡利斯特的声音协调起来；怎样一面抽着烟斗一面看着麦卡利斯特指的这个那个地方，玩味着那场风暴、漆黑的夜、和渔民在那里奋斗的情景。他喜欢男人黑夜中在刮着大风的海滩上卖命苦干，用智慧和体力与风浪搏斗；他喜欢男人这样干活，而女人应该持家，当男人在风暴中葬身海底时，她们在屋子里坐在熟睡的孩子身旁。这一点詹姆斯看得出来，卡姆也看得出来（他们看看他。又看看对方），他们从他突然抬起头来、从他的全神贯注、他说话的声调口气中看出了这一点。他在询问麦卡利斯特关于在风暴中避入海湾的那十一条船时，声音中带上了些微苏格兰口音，使他自己也有点像个农民。十一条船中有三条沉没了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, the breeze was freshening. The boat was leaning, the water was sliced sharply and fell away in green cascades, in bubbles, in cataracts. Cam looked down into the foam, into the sea with all its treasure in it, and its speed hypnotised her, and the tie between her and James sagged a little. It slackened a little. She began to think, How fast it goes. Where are we going? and the movement hypnotised her, while James, with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered grimly. But he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he might be quit of it all. They might land somewhere; and be free then. Both of them, looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape and exaltation, what with the speed and the change. But the breeze bred in Mr Ramsay too the same excitement, and, as old Macalister turned to fling his line overboard, he cried out aloud, "We perished," and then again, "each alone." And then with his usual spasm of repentance or shyness, pulled himself up, and waved his hand towards the shore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，迎面吹来的风令人感到清新。小船倾斜着破浪前进，切开水面，掀起绿色的瀑布、飞沫和急流。卡姆低头看着下面的泡沫，看着大海和它的无穷宝藏，船的速度令她入迷，她和詹姆斯之间的纽带松开了一点。它松弛了下来。她开始思索。小船走得多快啊！我们往哪儿去？船的运动令她入迷。而詹姆斯呢，他的眼睛紧盯着帆和地平线，严峻地掌着舵。但是当他掌舵时，他开始想到他可能逃避；他可能摆脱这一切。他们可能在什么地方着陆；那时就自由了。他们互相对看了片刻，速度和变化造成了两个人的逃避感和兴奋感。但风也使拉姆齐先生产生了同样的兴奋感，在老麦卡利斯特转过身去把钓鱼线扔下水去时，他大声叫喊道，“我们死去了，”然后又说，“各自孤零零地死去。”随即和平时一样感到一阵后悔或羞愧，然后恢复了镇静，向岸上招手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked proudly where Macalister pointed; and Cam thought, feeling proud of him without knowing quite why, had he been there he would have launched the lifeboat, he would have reached the wreck, Cam thought. He was so brave, he was so adventurous, Cam thought. But she remembered. There was the conpact; to resist tyranny to the death. Their grievance weighed them down. They had been forced; they had been bidden. He had borne them down once more with his gloom and his authority, making them do his bidding, on this fine morning, come, because he wished it, carrying these parcels, to the Lighthouse; take part in these rites he went through for his own pleasure in memory of after him, all the pleasure of the day was spoilt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他得意地看着麦卡利期特所指之处；卡姆自己也不知道为什么为他感到骄傲，她想，要是他当时在场，他一定会放下救生艇，去到失事的船只所在之处，卡姆想。他是这样的勇敢，这样充满了冒险精神，卡姆想。但是她记起了那个盟约：至死反抗暴行。他们的不满沉重地压着他们。他们是被迫来的；他们是被命令来的。他又一次以自己的忧伤和权威来压他们，让他们按他的意志行事，在这个美好的早晨拿着这些大包小裹到灯塔去，就因为这是他的希望；他为了自己的满足要纪念死者，他们就得参加他的仪典；他们讨厌这样做，所以就磨蹭着跟在后面，把一天的高兴劲儿全给败坏了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"See the little house," he said pointing, wishing Cam to look. She raised herself reluctantly and looked. But which was it? She could no longer make out, there on the hillside, which was their house. All looked distant and peaceful and strange. The shore seemed refined, far away, unreal. Already the little distance they had sailed had put them far from it and given it the changed look, the composed look, of something receding in which one has no longer any part. Which was their house? She could not see it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看见那所小屋子了吗，”他指点着说，希望卡姆朝那儿看。她很不情愿地直起身子来看。可是是哪一所呢？她已经分不出来山坡上哪所房子是他们的了。所有的房子都显得遥远、宁静而陌生。海岸看上去优雅、遥远、虚幻。他们航行的这点距离已经使他们之间隔得很远，改变了湾岸的样子，它显得镇静自若，渐渐退去，和他们不再有有任何关系，哪所房子是他们的？她看不出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I beneath a rougher sea," Mr Ramsay murmured. He had found the house and so seeing it, he had also seen himself there; he had seen himself walking on the terrace, alone. He was walking up and down between the urns; and he seemed to himself very old and bowed. Sitting in the boat, he bowed, he crouched himself, acting instantly his part -- the part of a desolate man, widowed, bereft; and so called up before him in hosts people sympathising with him; staged for himself as he sat in the boat, a little drama; which required of him decrepitude and exhaustion and sorrow (he raised his hands and looked at the thinness of them, to confirm his dream) and then there was given him in abundance women's sympathy, and he imagined how they would soothe him and sympathise with him, and so getting in his dream some reflection of the exquisite pleasure women's sympathy was to him, he sighed and said gently and mournfully,</div>

<div class="line_en">But Cam could see nothing. She was thinking how all those paths and the lawn, thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there, were gone: were rubbed out; were past; were unreal, and now this was real; the boat and the sail with its patch; Macalister with his earrings; the noise of the waves -- all this was real. Thinking this, she was murmuring to herself, "We perished, each alone," for her father's words broke and broke again in her mind, when her father, seeing her gazing so vaguely, began to tease her. Didn't she know the points of the compass? he asked. Didn't she know the North from the South? Did she really think they lived right out there? And he pointed again, and showed her where their house was, there, by those trees. He wished she would try to be more accurate, he said: "Tell me -- which is East, which is West?" he said, half laughing at her, half scolding her, for he could not understand the state of mind of any one, not absolutely imbecile, who did not know the points of the compass. Yet she did not know. And seeing her gazing, with her vague, now rather frightened, eyes fixed where no house was Mr Ramsay forgot his dream; how he walked up and down between the urns on the terrace; how the arms were stretched out to him. He thought, women are always like that; the vagueness of their minds is hopeless; it was a thing he had never been able to understand; but so it was. It had been so with her -- his wife. They could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds. But he had been wrong to be angry with her; moreover, did he not rather like this vagueness in women? It was part of their extraordinary charm. I will make her smile at me, he thought. She looks frightened. She was so silent. He clutched his fingers, and determined that his voice and his face and all the quick expressive gestures which had been at his command making people pity him and praise him all these years should subdue themselves. He would make her smile at him. He would find some simple easy thing to say to her. But what? For, wrapped up in his work as he was, he forgot the sort of thing one said. There was a puppy. They had a puppy. Who was looking after the puppy today? he asked. Yes, thought James pitilessly, seeing his sister's head against the sail, now she will give way. I shall be left to fight the tyrant alone. The compact would be left to him to carry out. Cam would never resist tyranny to the death, he thought grimly, watching her face, sad, sulky, yielding. And as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a green hillside and hills is gloom and sorrow, and it seems as if the hills themselves must ponder the fate of the clouded, the darkened, either in pity, or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay: so Cam now felt herself overcast, as she sat there among calm, resolute people and wondered how to answer her father about the puppy; how to resist his entreaty -- forgive me, care for me; while James the lawgiver, with the tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee (his hand on the tiller had become symbolical to her), said, Resist him. Fight him. He said so rightly; justly. For they must fight tyranny to the death, she thought. Of all human qualities she reverenced justice most. Her brother was most god-like, her father most suppliant. And to which did she yield, she thought, sitting between them, gazing at the shore whose points were all unknown to her, and thinking how the lawn and the terrace and the house were smoothed away now and peace dwelt there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是卡姆什么也看不见。她在想着织结着他们在那儿的生活岁月的那些小径和草坪已经消失了：它们已被抹掉；成了过去；成了虚幻的东西，而现在这才是现实；这条小船和带补丁的帆；戴着耳环的麦卡利斯特；海浪的轰鸣——这一切才是真实的。她想着这一切，喃喃自语道“我们死去了，各自孤零零地死去”，因为她父亲的话不断冲击她的头脑，这时她的父亲看到她那茫然的目光，开始逗她。难道她不知道罗盘上标的方位吗？他问道。难道她分不出南北吗？难道她真的以为他们住在那边吗？他又指给她看他们的房子在哪儿，在那边，那些树的旁边。他希望她努力把方向辨得更准一点，他说：“告诉我——哪是东，哪是西？”他半取笑半责备地说，因为他无法理解一个不是绝对的低能却看不懂罗盘上标的方体的人的心理状态。可是她却看不懂。看到她那茫然、现在又带着惊恐的目光盯在根本没有房子的地方，拉姆齐先生忘记了自己的幻想；忘记了他如何在平台上的花瓮之间徘徊；忘记了女人们如何向他伸出了臂膀。他想道，女人总是这样；她们头脑之糊涂真是没治了；这是他从来没法理解的一件事；但事实就是如此。她——他的妻子——是这样。她们无法把任何事情清楚地记在脑子里。但是他对她生气是错误的；何况，难道他不是挺喜欢女人身上的这种糊涂劲儿吗？这是她们特有的魅力的一部分。我要让卡姆对我笑起来，他想道。她看上去很害怕。她一句话也不说。他控住自己的手指，决心压低声音，并且抑制住多年来他可以任意支配、使人们同情他赞美他的、富有表现力的面部表情和手势。他要让她对他笑起来。他要找点什么简单轻松的事来和她谈。可是谈什么呢？因为，像他这样全神贯注于自己的工作之中，已经忘记该说些什么了。对了，有条小狗。他们有条小狗。今天谁在照看小狗？他问道。是的，詹姆斯看见在船帆衬托下姐姐的头，心里毫无怜悯地想道，现在她要屈服了。只剩下我独自和这个暴君斗争了。那个盟约就要留给他一个人去履行了。卡姆永远不会至此反抗暴行了，他看着她那悲伤、阴郁、屈从的脸，严厉地想道。就如有时发生的那样，云层遮住了一片绿色的山坡，气氛变得低沉，周围的群山也会笼罩在阴郁忧伤之中，似乎群山需要思考被云层遮住的、变暗了的山坡的命运，或同情、或恶意地幸灾乐祸：卡姆现在就是这样，她坐在这些平静、坚定的人之中，感到自己被乌云笼罩住了，不知道怎样问答父亲关于小狗的问题；怎样抵抗他的恳求——原谅我，关心我；而立法者詹姆斯，膝上摊开放着永恒智慧的碑文（他放在舵柄上的手对于她具有了象征意义），在说，抵抗他。和他斗争。他说得非常对，非常公正。因为他们必须至死和暴行斗争，她心里想。在人类所有的品质中，她最尊崇的就是公正。她弟弟像神一般公正，她父亲最会乞怜哀求。她坐在他们两个人之间，看着她对它们在罗盘上的方位一无所知的海岸，想着现在草坪、平台和房子都已消失，那儿一片宁静，她想，该向谁屈服呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And what was she going to call him? her father persisted. He had had a dog when he was a little boy, called Frisk. She'll give way, James thought, as he watched a look come upon her face, a look he remembered. They look down he thought, at their knitting or something. Then suddenly they look up. There was a flash of blue, he remembered, and then somebody sitting with him laughed, surrendered, and he was very angry. It must have been his mother, he thought, sitting on a low chair, with his father standing over her. He began to search among the infinite series of impressions which time had laid down, leaf upon leaf, fold upon fold softly, incessantly upon his brain; among scents, sounds; voices, harsh, hollow, sweet; and lights passing, and brooms tapping; and the wash and hush of the sea, how a man had marched up and down and stopped dead, upright, over them. Meanwhile, he noticed, Cam dabbled her fingers in the water, and stared at the shore and said nothing. No, she won't give way, he thought; she's different, he thought. Well, if Cam would not answer him, he would not bother her Mr Ramsay decided, feeling in his pocket for a book. But she would answer him; she wished, passionately, to move some obstacle that lay upon her tongue and to say, Oh, yes, Frisk. I'll call him Frisk. She wanted even to say, Was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone? But try as she might, she could think of nothing to say like that, fierce and loyal to the compact, yet passing on to her father, unsuspected by James, a private token of the love she felt for him. For she thought, dabbling her hand (and now Macalister's boy had caught a mackerel, and it lay kicking on the floor, with blood on its gills) for she thought, looking at James who kept his eyes dispassionately on the sail, or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon, you're not exposed to it, to this pressure and division of feeling, this extraordinary temptation. Her father was feeling in his pockets; in another second, he would have found his book. For no one attracted her more; his hands were beautiful, and his feet, and his voice, and his words, and his haste, and his temper, and his oddity, and his passion, and his saying straight out before every one, we perish, each alone, and his remoteness. (He had opened his book.) But what remained intolerable, she thought, sitting upright, and watching Macalister's boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish, was that crass blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter storms, so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage and remembered some command of his; some insolence: "Do this," "Do that," his dominance: his "Submit to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她打算给小狗取个什么名字？父亲追问道。他小的时候有过一条狗，叫弗里斯克。她会屈服的，詹姆斯看着她脸上出现的表情、一种他记得的表情，心里想道。她们低头看着编织的活儿什么的，然后突然抬起头来。他记得有一道蓝光一闪，后来和他坐在一起的一个人笑了起来，屈服了，他非常生气。肯定是他母亲，他想，她坐在一张矮椅子上，他父亲高站在一旁。他开始在被岁月轻轻地、永不停止地一页页、一层层搁置在他脑海中的无数一连串的印象中搜寻；在气息和声音中搜寻；在各种人声中搜寻：刺耳的、空洞的、甜美的；灯光掠过，扫帚嗒嗒响；海浪轻轻冲刷海岸，一个男人大步走来走去，突然停住，笔直地高站在他们旁边。在回忆的同时，他注意到卡姆在用手玩水，眼睛盯着海岸，一声不吭。不，她不会屈服，他想；她不一样，他想。好吧，拉姆齐先生决定，如果卡姆不愿回答，他就不去打搅她了，于是把手伸进口袋里去摸本书。但是她愿意回答他；她强烈地希望能除掉舌头上的什么障碍，说，哦，是的，弗里斯克，我就叫它弗里斯克。她甚至想说，它是不是那条自己在野地里找回家来的狗？但不管她如何努力，却想不出像这样的话来说，她热烈地忠实于他们的盟约，然而又要在不引起詹姆斯疑心的情况下、向父亲传递自己对他的爱的表示。她手玩着水（现在麦卡利斯特的儿子捉到了一条马鲛鱼，它在船舱里蹦，腮里流着血），眼睛看着毫无表情地盯着船帆、或偶尔看一眼地平线的詹姆斯，心里想，你没有受到这种压力和感情的矛盾，这种强烈的诱惑。她的父亲正在口袋里摸索；再过一秒钟就要找到他的书了。因为没有任何人比他对她更具有吸引力；他的手、他的脚、他的声音、他的言语、他的急躁、他的脾气、他的怪癖、他的激情、他在大庭广众下说出，我们死去、各自孤零零地死去、以及他的冷漠，对于她都是美丽的。（他已经打开了书。）但是，她笔直地坐在那里看着麦卡利斯特的儿子从另一条鱼的鳃里往外拔鱼钩，心里想，使人无法忍受的是他那极度的盲目和专横，它破坏了她的童年，引起了痛苦的风暴，以至于直到现在她还会在半夜惊醒过来，气得浑身发抖地记起他的某个命令或横蛮无理的态度：“干这个”，“干那个”；他的主宰一切，他的“服从我”。">查看中文翻译</div>
