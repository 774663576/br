<div class="line_en">It was the first week in September, back to school week, and after thirty-five consecutive autumns, my old professor did not have a class waiting for him on a college campus. Boston was teeming with students, double-parked on side streets, unloading trunks. And here was Morrie in his study. It seemed wrong, like those football players who finally retire and have to face that first Sunday at home, watching on TV, thinking, I could still do that. I have learned from dealing with those players that it is best to leave them alone when their old seasons come around. Don't say anything. But then, I didn't need to remind Morrie of his dwindling time.</div>

<div class="line_en">For our taped conversations, we had switched from handheld microphones -- because it was too difficult now for Morrie to hold anything that long -- to the lavaliere kind popular with TV newspeople. You can clip these onto a collar or lapel. Of course, since Morrie only wore soft cotton shirts that hung loosely on his ever-shrinking frame, the microphone sagged and flopped, and I had to reach over and adjust it frequently. Morrie seemed to enjoy this because it brought me close to him, in hugging range, and his need for physical affection was stronger than ever. When I leaned in, I heard his wheezing breath and his weak coughing, and he smacked his lips softly before he swallowed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Whenever people ask me about having children or not having children, I never tell them what to do," Morrie said now, looking at a photo of his oldest son. "I simply say, 'There is no experience like having children.' That's all. There is no substitute for it. You cannot do it with a friend. You cannot do it with a lover. If you want the experience of having complete responsibility for another human being, and to learn how to love and bond in the deepest way, then you should have children."</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet when I looked at Morrie, I wondered if I were in his shoes, about to die, and I had no family, no children, would the emptiness be unbearable? He had raised his two sons to be loving and caring, and like Morrie, they were not shy with their affection. Had he so desired, they would have stopped what they were doing to be with their father every minute of his final months. But that was not what he wanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，当我望着莫里时，我不禁在想，如果我处于他的境遇，将不久于人世，但我没有家庭，没有孩子，我能承受得了那种空虚感吗？莫里培养了两个富有爱心的儿子。他们像父亲一样勇于表露感情。要是莫里有这个愿望的话，他们会放下工作，分分秒秒地陪在父亲的身边，伴他走完最后几个月的旅程。但这不是莫里的意愿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do not stop your lives," he told them. "Otherwise, this disease will have ruined three of us instead of one." In this way, even as he was dying, he showed respect for his children's worlds. Little wonder that when they sat with him, there was a waterfall of affection, lots of kisses and jokes and crouching by the side of the bed, holding hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"别停止你们的生活，"他对他们说。"不然的话，被病魔毁掉的不是我一个，而是三个。" 因此，尽管他将不久于人世，他对孩子们的世界仍表示出极大的尊敬和自豪。当他们父子三个坐在一起时，常常会有瀑布般的感情宣泄，亲吻，打趣，相拥在床边，几只手握在一块。'>查看中文翻译</div>

He dreamed of being an actor or a singer; he reenacted TV shows at the dinner table, playing every part, his bright smile practically jumping through his lips. I was the good student, he was the bad; I was obedient, he broke the rules; I stayed away from drugs and alcohol, he tried everything you could ingest. He moved to Europe not long after high school, preferring the more casual lifestyle he found there. Yet he remained the family favorite.

<div class="line_en">That was the good news. The bad news was, my brother did not want me around-not me, nor anyone in the family. Much as we tried to call and visit, he held us at bay, insisting this fight was something he needed to do by himself. Months would pass without a word from him.

<div class="line_cn" title='我们看见了那辆从左边驶来的车。我们尖叫着想转个方向，但滑板却不听使唤。司机按响了喇叭并踩了刹车。我们作出了孩子才有的举动：从雪橇上跳了下来。穿着连帽滑雪衫的我们像两根圆木一样从冰冷、潮湿的雪地里滚下去，心想我们就要撞上轮胎了。我们尖叫着 "啊——" 不停地翻滚，只觉得天地都在旋转，脸吓得通红通红。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title='接着，什么也没发生。我们停止了滚落，换了口气，从脸上抹去湿漉漉的雪泥。车子已经驶远了，司机对着我们在摇手指。我们平安了。雪橇一头扎进了雪堆。伙伴们跑过来拍打着我们说，"直够玄的，你们差点就没命了。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I grin at my brother, and we are united by childish pride. That wasn't so hard, we think, and we are ready to take on death again.</div>
