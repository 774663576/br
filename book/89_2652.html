<div class="line_en">Bloody gangsters," Kent always used to call them, the people who were responsible for things such as street violence, extortionate taxes, pickpocketing, graffiti in public toilets, and hotels where all the deck chairs were occupied when Kent came down to the pool. All things of this kind were caused by "gangsters." It was an effective system, always having people there to blame for everything without ever having to define who they really were.</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie never found out what he really wanted. What would have satisfied him? Would a lot of money have been enough, or was every last penny required? One time when David and Pernilla were teenagers, they gave him a coffee mug with a message on it: "He Who Dies with the Most Toys Wins." They said it was "ironic" but Kent seemed to take it as a challenge. He always had a plan, there was always a "bloody big deal" just round the corner. His company was just about to strike bigger and bigger deals in Germany; the flat they inherited from Britt-Marie's parents could finally be converted to a freehold so they could sell it for more money. Just a few more months. Just a few years. They got married because Kent's accountant said it made sense from a "tax-planning perspective." Britt-Marie never had a plan, she hoped it would be enough if you were faithful and in love. Until the day came when it wasn't enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽从来不明白肯特到底想要什么。究竟怎样才能让他满意？需要多少钱才能填饱他的胃口？大卫和佩妮拉小的时候，曾经送给肯特一个咖啡杯，上面印着一行字：“玩具最多的人笑到最后。”他们说这是为了“讽刺”他，可肯特却把这句话当成座右铭和奋斗的目标，无论何时他都有计划要完成，总有“该死的大买卖”要做。他的公司和德国人做的生意越来越大，为了换来更多的钱，他把两人从布里特—玛丽的父母那里继承来的老房子卖掉，他们结婚是因为肯特的会计说这样可以避税。布里特—玛丽从来没有什么计划，她觉得有信念和爱就足够了。后来的事实证明，只有这两样是远远不够的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bloody gangsters," Kent would have said if he'd been sitting with Britt-Marie this evening, in the little waiting room in the prison. "Put the criminals on a deserted island with a pistol each, and they'll clean up the sorry mess themselves." Britt-Marie never liked him talking like that, but she never said anything. Now when she thinks about it she has difficulties remembering the last time she said anything at all, until one day she left him without a word. Because of this, it always feels as if the whole thing was her fault.</div>

<div class="line_en">She wonders what he's doing now. If he feels well and wears clean shirts. If he takes his medicine. If he looks for things in kitchen drawers and yells out her name before he remembers that she's no longer there. She wonders if he is with her, the young and beautiful woman, and if she likes pizza. Britt-Marie wonders what he would say if he knew she was sitting in a waiting room in a prison full of gangsters. If he'd be worried. If he'd tell a joke at her expense. If he'd touch her and whisper that everything would be all right, like he used to do in the days after she had buried her mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想知道肯特正在干什么，心情如何，是不是穿着干净衬衣，吃没吃药，敞开厨房抽屉找东西时，会不会喊她的名字，然后才发现她不在那儿了。她还想知道他是不是和那个年轻漂亮的女人在一起，那个女人喜不喜欢披萨。想知道如果肯特发现她跑到一个全是小混混的监狱等候室里坐着会怎么想，会担心她还是取笑她，会不会碰碰她，轻声说“一切都会好起来的”，就像她埋葬了母亲之后的那些日子里他经常做的那样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He drives the police car through Borg and out the other side. Turns off down a gravel track. It apparently goes on forever, but when they finally stop it suddenly seems inconceivable that they were just in a built-up area. The car is surrounded by trees, and the silence is of a sort that only exists where there are no people.</div>
