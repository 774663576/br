<div class="line_cn" title="但是，不管怎样，里尔还是打算强迫我让她陪伴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides being crazy annoyed, I did feel smug for a brief second. Because I didn't even have to think about controlling my temper. It was easy now, something I just did, natural. The red haze didn't wash over my eyes. The heat didn't shiver down my spine. My voice was calm when I answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，由于我烦得快疯掉了，我的确有那么一会儿很自鸣得意，因为我甚至不必去想控制自己的脾气。现在很容易了，我只是自然而然地做一些事情。红色的薄雾没有遮蔽我的眼睛，热气也没有让我的脊梁颤抖，我回答的时候语气很平静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remembered back to when I used to think that Leah was pretty, maybe even beautiful. That was a long time ago. No one thought of her that way now. Except for Sam. He was never going to forgive himself. Like it was his fault that she'd turned into this bitter harpy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回想到我以前还认为里尔很漂亮，或许还很美丽。那是很久以前了，现在没有人这么认为了，除了山姆。他永远都不会原谅自己，好像她变成这种鹰身女妖般的恶毒泼妇都是他的错一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I pretend to listen, will you leave?" I asked, glancing over at the permanent scowl on her face. I wasn't sure if she had any other expressions anymore.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is making me sick, Jacob. Can you imagine what this feels like to me? I don't even like Bella Swan. And you've got me grieving over this leech-lover like I'm in love with her, too. Can you see where that might be a little confusing? I dreamed about kissing her last night!

<div class="line_cn" title="我再次控制住自己，愤怒地盯着她。颤抖逐渐慢下来的时候，她注视着我的手，微笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time I had to work. I closed my eyes and fought the hot taste in my mouth. I pushed and shoved against the slide of fire down my back, wrestling to keep my shape together while my body tried to shake apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次我不得不做点什么了。我闭上眼睛，勉强咽下喉咙里火烧火燎的味道。我推攘着把心中的怒火压下去，挣扎着保持身体镇定，而它却想要颤抖着四分五裂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you're upset about gender confusion, Leah…" I said. Slow, emphasizing each word. "How do you think the rest of us like looking at Sam through your eyes? It's bad enough that Emily has to deal with your fixation. She doesn't need us guys panting after him, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你对性别上的迷惑感到很难受的话，里尔……”我说道，慢慢地强调每个字眼儿，“你认为我们其他人多么喜欢透过你的眼睛看山姆？艾米莉不得不应付你的不正常的依恋已经够糟糕的了，她不需要我们这些男孩子也跟着渴望他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She scrambled to her feet -- pausing only to spit in my direction -- and ran for the trees, vibrating like a tuning fork.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="因为她的话还在那里，它们胡乱地挤进我的脑海，由此产生的痛苦那么强烈，几乎让我无法呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it did matter that she was giving up everything -- that she was letting her heart stop and her skin ice over and her mind twist into some crystallized predator's head. A monster. A stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她打算放弃一切——让自己的心脏停止跳动，皮肤冰冷，思想扭曲成某个具体的捕猎者的头脑，一个魔鬼，一个陌生人——这些的确很重要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Again, I had to fight the rage. Maybe, if not for Leah, it would be good to let the heat change me into a creature who could deal with it better. A creature with instincts so much stronger than human emotions. An animal who couldn't feel pain in the same way. A different pain. Some variety, at least. But Leah was running now, and I didn't want to share her thoughts. I cussed her under my breath for taking away that escape, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再次，我不得不克制我的怒火。或许，要不是里尔的话，让热量把我变成能够更好地应付此类事情的生物倒是很不错的主意。一种本能比人的情感要强烈得多的生物，一种不会这样感到痛苦的动物。一种别样的痛苦，至少，是一种变化，但是里尔现在在奔跑，我不想分担她的想法，我也小声地责骂她夺走了逃路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wait for us, Quil complained. He was closer, just starting out from the village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等等我们。吉尔抱怨道。他离我更近，从村子里出发了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The trees blurred into a sea of black flowing around me. My muscles bunched and released in an effortless rhythm. I could run like this for days and I would not be tired. Maybe, this time, I wouldn't stop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树木变得模糊起来，像黑色的海洋一样从我身边飞过。我的肌肉轻松自如地一张一弛，我可以接连许多天不知疲倦地像这样奔跑。或许，这一次，我不会停下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could see through his eyes. He was far away, to the north, but he had wheeled around and was racing to join me. I growled and pushed myself faster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可以看透他的眼睛。他在很遥远的地方，在北边，但是他已经转向，正朝我这边奔跑过来，我咆哮着让自己跑得更快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could feel their worry in my head, try hard as I might to drown it in the sound of the wind and the forest. This was what I hated most -- seeing myself through their eyes, worse now that their eyes were full of pity. They saw the hate, but they kept running after me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我的头脑中我能感受到他们的担心，我尽可能地让风和树鱼贯而过的呼啸声把它淹没。这是我最讨厌的——通过他们的眼睛看见我自己，现在他们的眼里充满同情让我感到更糟糕。他们看见了讨厌，但是他们还是在我身后紧追不舍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Let him go. Sam's thought was soft, but still an order. Embry and Quil slowed to a walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让他去吧。山姆的思想很轻柔，但是仍然是命令。安布里和吉尔减慢速度，开始走起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If only I could stop hearing, stop seeing what they saw. My head was so crowded, but the only way to be alone again was to be human, and I couldn't stand the pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是我能停止听见，停止看见他们所看见的就好了。我的头脑里面太拥挤了，但是再次一个人清静一下的唯一办法就是变成人形，而我无法忍受这种痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="谢谢你。我设法想到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Come home when you can. The words were faint, trailing off into blank emptiness as he left, too. And I was alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当你能够应付的时候就回家吧。这些话语很微弱，他离开之后慢慢地变成空白的空洞，现在我是一个人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So much better. Now I could hear the faint rustle of the matted leaves beneath my toenails, the whisper of an owl's wings above me, the ocean -- far, far in the west -- moaning against the beach. Hear this, and nothing more. Feel nothing but speed, nothing but the pull of muscle, sinew, and bone, working together in harmony as the miles disappeared behind me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样好多了。现在我能听见我脚趾下像垫子样的树叶发出的沙沙声，老鹰的翅膀在我头上飞过时的呼啸声，还有海洋——在西边，很远，很远——撞击沙滩时发出的呻吟声。我除了听见这些，再也听不见其他的声音了。除了速度什么也感觉不到，肌肉、肌腱、骨头一起和谐地运动拉伸，不一会儿数英里已经消失在我身后了，除此之外，我什么也感觉不到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the silence in my head lasted, I would never go back. I wouldn't be the first one to choose this form over the other. Maybe, if I ran far enough away, I would never have to hear again…</div>
