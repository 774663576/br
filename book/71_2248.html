<div class="line_en">This positive promise seemed to reassure Caderousse slightly. "Well, in that case," he said, "I want to tell you the truth -- I might even say, I am obliged to tell you about those whom poor Edmond considered his sincere and devoted friends."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就是：我就要把详细情形讲给您听了，假如您将来有利用到它的时候，您可决不能让任何人知道，说那是我讲出来的。因为我讲到的那些人，是既有钱又有势，假如他们把他们的手指尖弹到我身上，我就得象玻璃似的粉身碎骨。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have no fear, my friend," said the abbé. "I am a priest and confessions die in my heart. Remember that we have no other purpose than to carry out the wishes of our friend in a proper manner, so speak frankly, but without animosity; tell the truth, and the whole truth. I do not know and probably never shall know the people about whom you are to speak. In any case, I am Italian and not French. I belong to God and not to men: I am going to return to my monastery, having left it only to carry out the last wishes of a dying man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您放心好了，我的朋友，”长老答道。“我是一个教士，人们的忏悔只藏在我的心中。请记着，我们唯一的要求是适当地执行我们朋友的最后的愿望。所以，说吧，毋庸保留，也毋庸意气用事，把真相讲出来，讲出全部的真相。我并不认识，也决不会认识您快要说到的那些人。而且，我是一个意大利人而不是法国人，是只属于上帝而不属于人的，我就要退隐到我的修道院里，我此来只是为了来完成一个人临终时最后的愿望而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes: a meal that started in merriment and ended in sorrow. A police commissioner came in, followed by four soldiers, and Dantès was arrested."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对，到这一点为止我都知道了，”教士说。“邓蒂斯本人也只知道他自己个人的事，因为我跟您说过的那五个人，他后来永远没有遇到过，也不曾听人提起过他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, once Dantès had been taken into custody, Monsieur Morrel went to discover what had happened to him, and the news was not good. The old man went back home alone, wept as he folded up his best suit, spent the rest of the day pacing backwards and forwards in his room and did not go to bed that night: I was living directly below and I could hear him walking around from dusk till dawn. I must tell you that I did not sleep, either, because the poor father's grief was so painful to me that each of his steps crashed against my heart as if he had really stamped his foot on my chest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在邓蒂斯被捕以后，摩莱尔先生赶紧去打听消息，消息非常坏。老人独自回到家里，含着一泡眼泪折叠起他那套参加婚礼的衣服，整天地在他的房间里来回走动，绝对不肯上床，——因为我就住在他的下面，听到他整夜地走来走去。至于我，我向您保证我也是睡不着，因为那位可怜的爹爹的悲哀使我非常不安，他每走一步都传到我的心里，真象是他的脚踏在我的心上一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"'No,' he used to say, 'I shall never leave the house, because I am the person that my poor child loves above everything; and, if he comes out of prison, I am the one he will come to see first. What would he say if I was not there, waiting for him?'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘不，’他这样回答，‘我决不离开这间屋子，——因为我那可怜的孩子爱我比爱世界上任何东西更厉害，假如他一旦出狱，他首先就是来看我，要是我不在这儿等他，他会有什么想法呢？’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, Monsieur," said Caderousse, "you can only console those who wish to be consoled, and he didn't. In any case, I don't know why, but it seemed to me that he felt some disgust at the sight of me. Even so, one night when I could hear him sobbing, I could bear it no longer, so I went up. When I reached the door, he had stopped sobbing and was praying. I can't tell you, Monsieur, what eloquent words and what heart-rending pleas he found for his prayer: it was more than piety, it was more than grief. I'm no pious hypocrite myself, and I don't like the Jesuits, and that day I thought: it's as well, after all, that I am alone and the Good Lord never gave me any children, because if I was a father and I felt the same sorrow as that poor old man, I wouldn't be able to find all the words that he had for the Good Lord, either in my memory or in my heart, so I would go straight away and throw myself into the sea, to avoid suffering any longer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，先生，”卡德罗斯答道，“那些不听劝慰的人，我们是无法去劝慰他们的，而他就是那种人之一，而且，我也不知道为了什么，他似乎不大高兴见我。可是，有一夜，我听到他在那儿呜呜咽咽地哭，我再也忍不住想上去看看他，但当我到他门口的时候，他不哭了，在那儿祈祷了。先生，我现在无法向您复述他所用的那一切有力的字和哀求的话。那简直不是虔诚二字所能包含的，也不是悲哀二字所能包含的。我，我不是假虔诚的教徒，我也不喜欢那些伪教徒，我那时对自己说：‘我幸而只是孤身一个人，幸而善良的上帝没有送儿女给我，假如我做了父亲，假如我也象这个可怜的老人那样遭到了这种伤心的事情，我的记忆里或我的心里可找不到他对上帝所说的那些话，我只能立刻跳进海里来逃避我的悲哀。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The next day, Mercédès came to Marseille to beg Monsieur de Villefort's protection. She obtained nothing from him, but at the same time she went to see the old man. When she found him so sad and depressed, and learned that he had not been to bed that night or eaten since the day before, she wanted him to go with her so that she could take care of him, but the old man would never agree to it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二天，美茜蒂丝到马赛来请求维尔福先生庇护，结果还是一无所得。她于是去访问老人。当她看到他这样伤心，这样心碎，而且知道他从上一天起就不曾上过床，不曾吃过东西的时候，她就想请他和她一起回去，以便可以照顾他，但是老人不同意。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Day by day, he lived more alone and more isolated. Often, Monsieur Morrel and Mercédès came to see him, but his door was shut and, even though I was quite sure he was at home, he would not answer. One day when, exceptionally, he had invited Mercédès in and the poor girl, who was in despair herself, was trying to comfort him, he told her: 'Believe me, my dear, he's dead. Instead of us waiting for him, he is waiting for us; I am happy to think that, being older than you, I shall be the first to see him again.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他一天天地独自生活着，愈来愈孤独。摩莱尔先生和美茜蒂丝常来看他，但他的门是关着的，虽然我说他的确在家，但他总是不开门。有一天，他一反常例，竟放美茜蒂丝进去，那可怜的姑娘不顾她自己的悲哀和失望，竭力劝慰他。他对她说：‘相信我的话，我亲爱的女儿，他已经死了，现在不是我们在等他，倒是他在等待我们。我很快乐，因为我年纪最老，当然可以最先见到他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"However good-hearted one is, you understand, one eventually stops seeing people who depress you, so in the end Old Dantès was all alone. From time to time, from then on, I would see only strangers going up to his room, then coming down again with some packet under their coats. I soon guessed what the packets were: he was gradually selling everything he had in order to stay alive. Finally he came to the end of his miserable possessions. He owed three lots of rent and the landlord threatened to evict him. He begged for another week, which he was allowed -- I know all this because the landlord would come in to see me after leaving him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不论是哪个好脾气的人，听了那些刺心话，也不会再去看他的。所以老邓蒂斯最后终于只剩了孤零零的一个人。我不过时常看到有陌生人跑到他那儿去，下来的时候，总是遮遮掩掩地挟着一包东西。但我猜得到这些包里是什么：他是在把他所有的东西一点一点的卖掉，弄些钱来买吃的东西。最后那可怜的老头终于山穷水尽。他欠下了三季房租，他们威胁要赶他出去。他恳求再宽限一个星期，这一点是允许了。这件事我知道，因为房东在离开他的房间以后就到我的房间里来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mercédès came back. She found him so changed that once more she wanted to take him to her home. This was also Monsieur Morrel's advice, and he wanted to take him there by force; but the old man protested so loudly that they were afraid. Mercédès remained at his bedside and Monsieur Morrel went away, indicating to the Catalan that he was leaving a purse on the mantelpiece. But, with the doctor's prescription to back him up, the old man refused to take anything. Finally, after nine days of despair and abstinence, he died, cursing those who were the cause of his misfortune and telling Mercédès: 'If ever you see my Edmond again, tell him that I died with a blessing for him.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“美茜蒂丝又来了一次，她发觉他已大大地变样，所以比以前更切望能把他带到她自己住的地方去。摩莱尔先生的主意也是如此，他很想不顾老人的反对，硬送他去，但老人硬是不肯，并且嚎啕大哭，以致他们不敢再坚持。所以美茜蒂丝就留在他的床边，而摩莱尔先生也只好走了，走的时候，向她示意，表示他已经把他的钱袋留在壁炉架上。但是老人借口遵从医生的吩咐，不肯吃任何东西。终于在九天的绝望和绝食以后，老人死了，临死的时候诅咒着那些使他陷于这种惨境的人，并对美茜蒂丝说，‘要是你再能看到我的爱德蒙，告诉他我临死还是在为他祝福的。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The first three days, I heard him walking around as usual, then on the fourth the sounds stopped. I ventured to go up: the door was locked but through the keyhole I could see him, looking so pale and haggard that I thought he must be really ill; so I sent for Monsieur Morrel and went to see Mercédès. They both hurried round. Monsieur Morrel brought a doctor who diagnosed gastroenteritis and prescribed a diet. I was there, Monsieur, and I shall never forget the old man's smile when he heard that prescription. From then on, he opened his door: he had an excuse for not eating, since the doctor had put him on a diet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最初的三天，我听到他还是照常来回走动，但到第四天，我再听不到他的声音了。我于是决心不顾一切危险到他那儿去。门是关着的，我从钥匙孔里望进去，看到他苍白憔悴，似乎已病重万分。我就去告诉摩莱尔先生，然后又跑到美茜蒂丝那儿。他们两个人立刻来了，摩莱尔先生还带了一个医生来，医生说这是一种胃病，吩咐他吃限定的几样东西。那次我也在场，我永远不能忘记老人在听到这个药方的时候所现出的那个微笑。从那时起，他把门打开了。他这时已有借口可以不再多吃东西，因为医生已给他规定了口粮。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Fernand was a Spaniard, so he was sent to Madrid to report on the mood among his countrymen. He looked up Danglars, got in contact with him, promised his general support from the Royalists in the capital and the provinces, received promises in his turn, entered into agreements, guided his regiment by tracks that he alone knew through gorges under Royalist guard, and in short rendered such services in this short campaign that after the capture of the Trocadero he was appointed colonel and awarded the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honour, together with the title of count."</div>

On his earlier visit he had not said a word about love to Mercédès, but now he reminded her that he loved her."</div>
