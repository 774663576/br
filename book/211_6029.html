<div class="line_en">An up-hill and down-dale ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish mid-day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or Froom. mmediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals, the very bees and butterflies, drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads. It was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student-days; and, much as he loved his parents, he could not help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of home-life, affected him like throwing off splints and bandages; even the one customary curb on the humours of English rural societies being absent in this place, Talbothays having no resident landlord.</div>

<div class="line_en">He unbridled and fed his horse, and as he re-entered the house the clock struck three. Three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with the stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs. It was Tess's, who in another moment came down before his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把马嚼松开，喂上马，再回到屋里的时候，时钟刚好敲响了三点。这是下午撇奶油的时候；钟声一响，克莱尔就听见了头上楼板的咯吱声，听见了有人从楼梯上下楼的脚步声。那正是苔丝走路的声音。又过了一会儿，苔丝下了楼，出现在他的面前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not a human being was out of doors at the dairy. The denizens were all enjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the exceedingly early hours kept in summer-time rendered a necessity. At the door the wood-hooped pails, sodden and bleached by infinite scrubbings, hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb of an oak fixed there for that purpose; all of them ready and dry for the evening milking. Angel entered, and went through the silent passages of the house to the back quarters, where he listened for a moment. Sustained snores came from the cart-house, where some of the men were lying down; the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still further distance. The large-leaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept too, their broad limp surfaces hanging in the sun like half-closed umbrellas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶牛场上，门外看不见一个人。奶牛场里的居民，都在像平常一样享受午后一个小时左右的小睡，夏天起床非常早，中午小睡一会儿是不可缺少的；门前有一棵用来挂牛奶桶的剥了树皮的橡树桩固定在地上，树权上挂着带箍的木桶，木桶经过不断的擦洗，已经让水泡透了，洗白了，挂在那儿就像一顶顶帽子；所有的木桶都洗静了，晒干了，准备晚上挤牛奶使用。安琪尔走进院子，穿过屋子里静静的走道，来到后面，站在那儿听了一会儿。房里睡着几个男工，可以听见从房内传出来的他们的鼾声；在更远一点儿的地方，有一些猪热得难受，发出哼哼唧唧的叫声。长着宽大叶子的大黄和卷心菜也都入睡了，它们宽阔的叶面在太阳下低垂着，就像是半开半合的阳伞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had not heard him enter, and hardly realized his presence there. She was yawning, and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it had been a snake's. She had stretched one arm so high as above her coiled-up cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above the sunburn; her face was flushed with sleep, and her eyelids hung heavy over their pupils. The brimfulness of her nature breathed from her. It was a moment when a woman's soul is more incarnate than at any other time; when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh; and sex takes the outside place in the presentation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱尔进屋时她没有听见，也没有想到他会在楼下。她正打着阿欠，克莱尔看见她嘴里面红红的，仿佛蛇的嘴一样。她把一只胳臂高高地举起来，伸在已经被盘起来的头发上面，看得见头上被太阳晒黑的皮肤的上面部分，像缎子一样光滑白嫩；她的脸睡得红红的，眼皮低垂着，遮住了瞳孔。她的浑身上下都散发出女性成熟的气息。正是在这种时刻，一个女人的灵魂才比任何时候更像女人；也正是在这种时候，超凡脱俗的美才显示出肉欲的一面；女性的特征才在外面表现出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess's excitable heart beat against bis by way of reply; and there they stood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun slanting in by the window upon his back, as he held her tightly to his breast; upon her inclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her naked arm, and her neck, and into the depths of her hair. Having been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat. At first she would not look straight up at him, but her eyes soon lifted, and his plumbed the deepness of the ever-varying pupils, with their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet, while she regarded him as Eve at her second waking might have regarded Adam.</div>

<div class="line_en">Possibly the Talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that afternoon. Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared as having light and shade and position, but no particular outline.

<div class="line_en">'Yes -- well, my father has been talking a good deal to me of his troubles and difficulties, and the subject always tends to depress me. He is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from people of a different way of thinking from himself, and I don't like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his age, the more particularly as I don't think earnestness does any good when carried so far. He has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in which he took part quite recently. He went as the deputy of some missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of Trantridge, a place forty miles from here, and made it his business to expostulate with a lax young cynic he met with somewhere about there -- son of some landowner up that way -- and who has a mother afflicted with blindness. My father addressed himself to the gentleman point-blank, and there was quite a disturbance. It was very foolish of my father, I must say, to intrude his conversation upon a stranger when the probabilities were so obvious that it would be useless. But whatever he thinks to be his duty, that he'll do, in season or out of season; and, of course, he makes many enemies, not only among the absolutely vicious, but among the easy-going, who hate being bothered. He says he glories in what happened, and that good may be done indirectly; but I wish he would not so wear himself out now he is getting old, and would leave such pigs to their wallowing.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的——哦，我父亲跟我谈了许多的话，谈他的烦恼，谈他的困难，他谈的话对我总是有一种压抑的感觉。他是一个热情认真的人，遇到同他的想法不同的人，他们不仅冷淡他，甚至还动手打他，像他这样大年纪的一个人，我不愿意他遭受侮辱，尤其是一个人热心到那种程度，我认为并没有什么用处。他还告诉过我新近他遭遇的一件叫人非常不痛快的事。有一次他当一个讲道团的代表，到附近的特兰里奇去讲道，那是离这儿四十英里的一个地方，在那儿遇见了一个地主的儿子，妈妈是个瞎子。儿子是一个放荡狂妄的青年，我父亲就担负起教导他的责任，直截了当地教导他，结果竟引出了一场麻烦。我一定要说，我父亲太傻了，既然劝说明显是没有用的，何必去对一个素不相识的人费口舌呢。但是不管什么事，他只要认为是他的职责，他就不管什么时候，都要去做；当然，他结下了不少的仇人，其中不仅有绝对的坏人，也有一些容易相处的人，他们恨父亲多管闲事。他说，他的光荣就在发生的这些事情里，说善是在间接中实现的；可是我希望他不要老是这样自找苦吃，他已经渐渐老了，就让那些猪猡在污泥中打滚好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess's look had grown hard and worn, and her ripe mouth tragical; but she no longer showed any tremulousness. Clare's revived thoughts of his father prevented his noticing her particularly; and so they went on down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished and drained them off, when the other maids returned, and took their pails, and Deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk. As Tess withdrew to go afield to the cows he said to her softly --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝的脸色变得呆滞憔悴了，红润的嘴唇露出凄惨的情态；但是再也没有看见她有颤栗的表现。克莱尔又想起了他的父亲，因此没有注意到苔丝的特别表现；他们就这样继续撇那一长排方形盆子里的牛奶，直到都撇完了，牛奶都放掉了才歇手。其他的挤奶女工也来了，拎起了她们的牛奶桶，德贝拉也下来刷洗铅桶，预备装新的牛奶。在首丝到草场上去挤牛奶的时候，克莱尔温柔地问她——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'O no -- no!' replied she with grave hopelessness, as one who had heard anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to Alec d'Urberville. 'It can't be!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，不行——不行！”苔丝郑重和绝望地说，因为她刚才听见克莱尔说的德贝维尔的故事，又引发了她过去的痛苦。“我不可能嫁给你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went out towards the mead, joining the other milkmaids with a bound, as if trying to make the open air drive away her sad constraint. All the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows were grazing in the farther mead, the bevy advancing with the bold grace of wild animals -- the reckless unchastened motion of women accustomed to unlimited space -- in which they abandoned themselves to the air as a swimmer to the wave. It seemed natural enough to him now that Tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained Nature, and not from the abodes of Art.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她出了门，向草场走去，一步就跨进了挤奶女工的队伍中，仿佛要利用户外的新鲜空气，来赶走心中的不快。所有的女工们都向在远处草场上吃草的奶牛走去，这一群勇敢的姑娘身上带着野性的美，她们是一群已经习惯了不受任何拘束的姑娘，迈着自由随便的步子，在空旷的野外走着，就好像游泳的人去追逐波浪一样。克莱尔又看见了苔丝，现在他觉得，从无拘无束的自然中选择一个伴侣，而不是从艺术的宫殿里去选择伴侣，这都是再自然不过的。">查看中文翻译</div>
