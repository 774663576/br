<div class="line_en">He was now making three thousand francs a year, having started at fifteen hundred. He had remained a bachelor, as his means did not allow him the luxury of a wife, and as he had never enjoyed anything, he desired nothing. From time to time, however, tired of this continuous and monotonous work, he formed a platonic wish: "Gad! If I only had an income of fifteen thousand francs, I would take life easy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="初入公司的时候，他每年工资是一千五百金法郎。现在已经加到每年三千了。他一直过着单身生活，他的收入不容许他娶亲。从来毫无享受，也没有什么大的欲望。然而，偶尔他被这种单调而不断的日常工作弄得疲倦了的时候，他发表他理想式的希望：“活见鬼，倘若我每年有五千金法郎的利息进款，我就要舒舒服服花掉它。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Old Man Leras, bookkeeper for Messieurs Labuze and Company, left the store, he stood for a minute bewildered at the glory of the setting sun. He had worked all day in the yellow light of a small jet of gas, far in the back of the store, on a narrow court, as deep as a well. The little room where he had been spending his days for forty years was so dark that even in the middle of summer one could hardly see without gaslight from eleven until three.</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole sky was aflame; the Arc de Triomphe stood out against the brilliant background of the horizon, like a giant surrounded by fire. As he approached the immense monument, the old bookkeeper noticed that he was hungry, and he went into a wine dealer's for dinner.</div>

<div class="line_en">He set out. An old tune which one of his neighbors used to sing kept returning to his mind. He kept on humming it over and over again. A hot, still night had fallen over Paris. Monsieur Leras walked along the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne and watched the cabs drive by. They kept coming with their shining lights, one behind the other, giving horn a glimpse of the couples inside, the women in their light dresses and the men dressed in black.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他重新走动了。一首在从前被他一个女邻居唱过的古老曲子，总是萦绕在他的脑子里：林子新绿时，情人向我语：我望吾爱来，同往花棚下。他不停地哼着这首曲子，哼完了又来再哼。夜已经降到巴黎上空了，一个微风不动夜，一个很和暖的夜。勒腊先生随着布洛涅森林大道向前走，并且瞧着大道上的那些马车走过去。车子带着一对眼睛样的风灯，一辆跟着一辆走到近边、使人在一刹那中间望得见车子里成对儿的人搂在一处，女的穿的是浅颜色裙袍，而男的是黑颜色礼服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was one long procession of lovers, riding under the warm, starlit sky. They kept on coming in rapid succession. They passed by in the carriages, silent, side by side, lost in their dreams, in the emotion of desire, in the anticipation of the approaching embrace. The warm shadows seemed to be full of floating kisses. A sensation of tenderness filled the air. All these carriages full of tender couples, all these people intoxicated with the same idea, with the same thought, seemed to give out a disturbing, subtle emanation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个由爱人儿组成的长行列，在一个满是星星而很热的天空之下兜风。车子不断地来，不断地来。爱人们不断地过，不断地过，躺在车子里，静默地彼此互相搂着，沉溺在幻觉之中了。沉溺在欲望之中了，沉溺在因拥抱而起的颤抖之中了。热烘烘的阴影像是充满了飘着的吻，浮着的吻。一种温存意味的感觉使得空气变成了更为窒人呼吸的。这一切互相搂着的人儿，这一切被相同的期待、被相同的思想所陶醉的人儿，引起了一种狂热的气氛。这一切满载着爱抚的车子，如同一阵淡淡的、然而恼人的放射物似地，在它们的路线上闪过。">查看中文翻译</div>

And the thought of returning to this place, all alone, of getting into his bed, of again repeating all the duties and actions of every evening, this thought terrified him.
