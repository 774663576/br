<div class="line_en">At first because she had not wept when Walter died she was ashamed. It seemed dreadfully callous. Why, the eyes of the Chinese officer, Colonel Y #252;, had been wet with tears. She was dazed by her husband's death. It was difficult to understand that he would not come into the bungalow again and that when he got up in the morning she would not hear him take his bath in the Suchow tub. He was alive and now he was dead. The sisters wondered at her Christian resignation and admired the courage with which she bore her loss. But Waddington was shrewd; for all his grave sympathy she had a feeling that -- how should she put it? -- that he had his tongue in his cheek. Of course, Walter's death had been a shock to her. She didn't want him to die. But after all she didn't love him, she had never loved him; it was decent to bear herself with becoming sorrow; it would be ugly and vulgar even to let any one see in her heart; but she had gone through too much to make pretences to herself. It seemed to her that this at least the last few weeks had taught her, that if it is necessary sometimes to lie to others it is always despicable to lie to oneself. She was sorry that Walter had died in that tragic manner, but she was sorry with a purely human sorrow such as she might have felt if it had been an acquaintance. She would acknowledge that Walter had admirable qualities; it just happened that she did not like him; he had always bored her. She would not admit that his death was a relief to her, she could say honestly that if by a word of hers she could bring him back to life she would say it, but she could not resist the feeling that his death made her way to some extent a trifle easier. They would never have been happy together and yet to part would have been terribly difficult. She was startled at herself for feeling as she did; she supposed that people would think her heartless and cruel if they knew. Well, they shouldn't know. She wondered if all her fellows had in their hearts shameful secrets which they spent their time guarding from curious glances.</div>

<div class="line_en">But what did Charles Townsend matter?</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked very little into the future and she made no plans. The only thing she knew was that she wanted to stay in Hong Kong as short a while as might be. She looked forward to arriving there with horror. It seemed to her that she would like to wander for ever through that smiling and friendly country in her rattan chair, and, an indifferent spectator for ever of the phantasmagoria of life, pass each night under a different roof. But of course the immediate future must be faced: she would go to the hotel when she reached Hong Kong, she would arrange about getting rid of the house and selling the furniture; there would be no need to see Townsend. He would have the grace to keep out of her way. She would like, all the same, to see him once more in order to tell him what a despicable creature she thought him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看不见未来是什么样，心里也一点打算都没有。她唯一确定的是先要回到香港，在那里短暂地逗留片刻。她已经可以想象，抵达那片土地时，她一定仍是惊魂未定。不过她情愿永远坐在藤条轿子上，在怡人的乡村风光里游荡，每天在不同的屋檐下过夜，芸芸众生浮光掠影一般的生活与她毫不相干，她只是一个事不关己的漠然看客。但眼前的事她是必须要面对的，回到香港以后先要住进旅馆，把以前的房子退掉，家具能卖的都卖了。不需要去见唐生。他一定颇有风度地不来烦扰她。那她倒想去见他一面，就为告诉他她现在对他有多么鄙视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like a rich melody on a harp that rang in exultant arpeggios through the complicated harmonies of a symphony, one thought beat in her heart insistently. It was this thought which gave their exotic beauty to the rice-fields, which made a little smile break on her pale lips as a smooth- faced lad swung past her on his way to the market town with exultation in his carriage and audacity in his eyes, and which gave the magic of a tumultuous life to the cities she passed through. The city of the pestilence was a prison from which she was escaped, and she had never known before how exquisite was the blue-ness of the sky and what a joy there was in the bamboo copses that leaned with such an adorable grace across the causeway. Freedom! That was the thought that sung in her heart so that even though the future was so dim, it was iridescent like the mist over the river where the morning sun fell upon it. Freedom! Not only freedom from a bond that irked, and a companionship which depressed her; freedom, not only from the death which had threatened, but freedom from the love that had degraded her; freedom from all spiritual ties, the freedom of a disembodied spirit; and with freedom, courage and a valiant unconcern for whatever was to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个念头始终潜藏在她的心里，持续不断地敲击着她的心房，就好像在一部宏大的交响乐的复杂交织体中，总是贯穿了一条活跃而丰富的竖琴琶音的旋律——是它赋予了无边无际的稻田以奇异的美感，是它使她在一个驾车赶往集市的小伙儿对她兴奋而大胆地观瞧时，苍白的嘴角浮现出笑意。那座瘟疫肆虐的城市是一所她刚刚逃脱的监狱，如今的天空在她眼里从未如此地湛蓝，而斜倚在堤道上的竹林使人那般地惬意。自由！那就是一直在她心里蠢蠢欲动的念头。正是有了自由，尽管未来依然模糊不清，但却像小河上的薄雾一样，在晨光的辉耀下顿时显得五彩斑斓。自由！她挣脱了令人烦扰的束缚，那个纠缠于她左右的身影永远地消失了。死亡的威胁烟消云散，使她屈尊受纳的爱情已经随风而去。所有的精神羁绊统统地见鬼去了，留下的只有一个自由奔放的灵魂。有了自由，她也就有了无畏地面对未来的勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
