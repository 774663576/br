<div class="line_en">As the plane landed on the darkened airfield at Duala a unique smell invaded the cabin. It was musky and sultry, aromatic and coarse -- the smell of West Africa. Warm rain was falling; it felt like blood trickling down our sweaty faces as we hiked across the tarmac. Inside the airport was the most amazing chaos I have ever witnessed. Crowds of Europeans were huddled in desperate groups or screaming at Africans. Africans were screaming at Africans. A lone Arab was floating disconsolately from one desk to another. In front of each was the mad, jostling throng I recognized as a French queue. Here I had my second lesson in Cameroonian bureaucracy. It seemed that we had to collect three pieces of paper relating to our visas, health certificates and immigration arrangements. Numerous forms had to be filled in. There was a heavy trade in ballpoint pens. When the French had elbowed their way through to have the privilege of waiting in the rain for their luggage, the rest of us were attended to. Several of us made the mistake of being unable to supply exact addresses to which we were going and the names of business contacts. A large official sat at his desk reading the newspaper and ignoring us. Having established to his satisfaction our relative hierarchy, he interviewed us with an air of one not to be trifled with. Seeing the way things were going, I relented and supplied a wholly fictitious address, which was the recourse adopted by several others. In future I was always studiously precise in filling in all forms which were doubtless eaten by termites or thrown away unread. We all went back round the three desks again and through customs, where a drama was being enacted. A Frenchman's luggage had been opened and found to contain certain aromatic substances. In vain the man claimed that these were herbs to cook the sauces of French cuisine. The official was convinced he had captured a major trader in marijuana, even though it was common knowledge that a trade existed growing it inside Cameroon and smuggling it out. The French jostlers were back in operation and seemed to be doing quite well until the huge form of an immaculate African who had got on the first-class section at Nice sailed through. With a click of his gold-adorned fingers he indicated his luggage, which was promptly seized by porters. Luckily for me, my own luggage impeded the removal of his and so I was waved through and out into Africa.</div>

<div class="line_en">First impressions count for a lot. The man whose knees are not brown will be marked down by all manner of people. At all events, my camera case was promptly seized by what I took to be an enthusiastic porter. I revised my ideas when he swiftly made off into the distance. I set off in pursuit, using all manner of phrases uncommon in everyday speech. "Au secours! Au voleur!" I cried. Fortunately, he was delayed by traffic, I caught up, and we began to struggle. It ended with a swift blow that laid open the side of my face and the case was abandoned to me. A solicitous taxi driver took me to my hotel for only five times the normal fare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一印象至关重要。任何没有棕黑膝盖的人，一出关就会被各种人盯上。骚动中，有人一把抓走我的相机箱子，刚开始，我还以为他是热心的行李伕，但是当他一溜烟跑开，我马上知道自己错了，连忙拔腿追赶，嘴里喊着各式平常用不到的法语：“救命呀！小偷！”幸运的是，车阵挡住他的窜逃，我抓住他，两人一阵撕扭。结局是我的脸上挨了一拳，小偷抛下相机箱。一个热心的计程车司机载我去旅馆，只超收了我四倍车资。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day I tore myself away from the charms of Duala and flew on to the capital without incident, noting that I had adopted the loud, hostile manner of the other passengers towards porters and taxi drivers. In Yaounde I suffered a long bout of bureaucracy; as it took about three weeks to have my documents processed there was nothing to do but play tourist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，我忍心挥别杜阿拉的魅力诱惑，飞往首都，沿途没有任何意外，我却染上其他旅客的恶习，也开始以大嗓门、敌意态度对待行李伕与计程车司机。到了雅温得，我与官僚展开长时间“拔河”；公文旅行耗掉三星期，没别的事可做，只能当观光客。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My first impression of the city was that it had few charms. It is unpleasantly dusty in the dry season, a vast morass in the wet season. Its main monuments have all the appeal of motorway café architecture. Collapsed gratings in the pavements offer the unwary visitor a direct route to the town sewers. Newcomers seldom survive long without wrenching at least one limb. The life of expatriates centres around two or three cafés where they sit in deep boredom, staring at the passing yellow cabs and fighting off the attentions of souvenir sellers. These are gentlemen of the greatest charm who have learnt that white men will buy absolutely anything as long as it is overpriced. They offer for sale a blend of perfectly acceptable carvings and absolute rubbish as "genuine antiques". The whole trade is practised with something of the air of a game. Asked prices are something like twenty times what is reasonable. Should a client protest that he is being robbed, they giggle and agree, cutting their price to five times the going rate. Many enjoy something like a client | patron relationship with jaded Europeans, fully aware that the more outrageous their lies the greater will be the amusement they cause.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对雅温得的第一印象是乏善可陈。旱季尘土飞扬，雨季一片泥泞。主要的纪念建筑物都有公路餐馆的建筑风味。破损的水沟盖常让粗心游客一脚踏进阴沟。初到雅温得者免不了都要扭伤脚踝。此地外国人的生活重心集中于两三家咖啡馆，在里面无聊枯坐，瞪视街上穿梭的黄色计程车，抵挡热心兜售纪念品的小贩。这些小贩是极富魅力的绅士，知道只要货品标价超高，白人都会照单全收。他们会向你推销不错的木雕以及号称“真实古董”的垃圾。买卖过程带着游戏气氛。开价大约是合理价的二十倍。顾客骂他们是土匪，他们咯咯笑着同意，把售价降到正常价的五倍。他们与疲惫的欧洲游客有着类似顾客/恩人的关系，颇乐在其中，知道自己开价越疯狂不合理，便越能制造乐趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Far more interesting were the young French community of co-opérants, people doing foreign service as an alternative to national service in the army. They had somehow managed to set up a replica of provincial French social life incorporating factors such as barbecues, motor rallies and parties with minimal regard to the fact that they were in West Africa. I rapidly established links with one ménage, one girl and two boys who were variously engaged in professional teaching and later proved invaluable. Unlike the diplomatic community, they actually left the capital and had information about the state of roads, the vehicle market, etc., and spoke to Africans who were not their servants. It came as a great surprise to me after the officials with whom I had to deal, how extremely friendly and pleasant the people were; I had by no means expected this. After the political resentments of West Indians and Indians I had known in England, it struck me as ridiculous that it should be in Africa that people of different races should be able to meet on easy, uncomplicated terms. Of course it turned out not to be quite as simple as that. Relations between Europeans and Africans are complicated by all kinds of factors. Often the Africans concerned have learnt to conform so well that they are little other than black Frenchmen. On the other hand, Europeans resident in Africa tend to be rather weird people. Their conspicuous ordinariness is perhaps the reason the diplomatic community fare so badly; madmen -- and I met several of them -- fare very well despite the havoc they leave behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比较有趣的是那些正在服“援助替代役”的法国年轻人，他们以海外服务替代军役。尽管身在西非洲，还是有办法以烤肉、赛车、派对等各式活动复制法国乡村生活。我很快便与一对夫妇、一个年轻女孩与两个年轻男孩交上朋友，他们都是老师，我们的交情后来证明珍贵无比。他们和外交人员不同，他们真的离开首都到乡间，熟知公路与汽车市场资讯，也和仆人以外的非洲人说过话。与喀麦隆官员交手后，我完全没料到一般非洲人非常友善和蔼；在英国时，我习于大家对西印度群岛与印度人的政治反感情绪，万万没想到在非洲看到各色人种轻松单纯相处。当然，后来证明事实并非如此简单。各种因素使然，欧洲人与非洲人的关系十分复杂。通常，与欧洲人共事的非洲人早就学会顺从，看起来就像“黑种法国人”。而定居非洲的欧洲人十之八九是怪胎。或许正因为他们的特立独行，外交人员的日子才会如此难过；相对的，怪胎（我在此间碰过不少）的日子颇好过，他们都把烂摊子留给别人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was at this point that I made two blunders that reveal how very little I knew about the world I was moving in. First, I went to the post office to send a telegram to N'gaoundere, my next staging post up the railway line, warning them of my imminent arrival. It got there a fortnight later, which was considered about average by old hands. It also acquainted me with a very odd Australian who, despairing of arrogant officials and locals who had learnt their jostling from the French, was reduced to standing in the middle of the floor shouting to everybody's surprise, "I've understood. I'm the wrong bleedin' colour in' I?" He thereupon declared in good round terms that he never intended to write to his mother again from Cameroonian territory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，我铸下两个大错，证实我对即将生活的世界一无所知。首先，我去邮局拍电报到恩冈代雷（我搭火车的下一站），告诉他们我即将抵达。结果，电报十四天后才抵达，对非洲老手来说，这算正常速度。我在邮局里结识了一个奇怪的澳洲人，他被傲慢的办事员以及跟法国人学了一身推挤本事的本地人搞得抓狂，无奈地站在邮局中央、令人吃惊地髙喊：“我知道。都是因为我天杀的肤色不对！”然后，他直称再也不妄想从喀麦隆寄信给母亲了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Time was passing and African cities are by no means cheap; Yaounde is classed as one of the most expensive places on earth for a foreigner. While I was living in no great style, money was going fast and I simply had to get out; I would have to make a scene. Steeling my nerve, I went to the Bureau of Immigration. Behind the desk sat the supercilious inspector I had dealt with on previous visits. He looked up from the documents he was reading and began an intricate process involving a cigarette and lighter, ignoring my greeting, and threw my passport on the desk. Instead of the two years I had asked for, I had been mysteriously given nine months in the country. Thankful for small mercies, I left.</div>

<div class="line_en">Luckily, I was able to sell him one of my own stamps at which point he exploded in maudlin Commonwealth affection and insisted I take beer with him. After several of these he revealed that he had been travelling for more than two years and never spent more than fifty pence a day. I was suitably impressed until he took his leave without paying for the beer.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was then I made my most serious error so far. Hitherto, I had kept the major part of my research grant in the form of a certified international cheque which I carried on me at all times. It seemed to me prudent to deposit this in a bank, which only took me about an hour of the jostling and arrogance treatment. I was blandly assured by a plausible young man that a cheque book would be sent to me at N'gaoundere within twenty-four hours and that I would thus be able to draw on the account as necessary. Incredibly, I believed him. In fact it took some five months to gain access to the money I had so lightly deposited. However, at the time it seemed a victory for reason in view of the many stories of crime circulating in ever more horrific versions among the white community. Many of the men have adopted the fashion of carrying small handbags, after the effete Continental manner, in which to keep the documents they are obliged to carry. It appears that gangs of huge African women roam the streets after dark snatching the purses of lone males, beating up those bold enough to resist. This is quite feasible. Africa is the home of the most astonishing physiques, both male and female, the result of lives of continuous hard physical labour and a diet low in protein. A willowy Westerner feels initially dwarfed by the pectoral developments of Southern Cameroonians.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，我犯下致命错误。目前为止，我大部分的研究经费都是开成国际保付支票，随身携带。此时看来似乎应存入银行，比较保险。我只花了一小时推推挤挤、饱尝傲慢对待，便存完了钱。一个能言善道的年轻人向我保证：二十四小时内支票便会寄至恩冈代雷，我随时可从户头提款。不可思议，我居然相信了。后来我足足花了五个月时间，才有办法动支当时漫不经心存进去的钱。但是当时看来存钱是理智选择，因为白人圈中流传可怕的犯罪故事，越传越耸人听闻。喀国规定出门必须携带各式证件，不少男性仿效欧洲大陆的文弱风格，手上拿个皮包。据说入夜后，胖大的非洲女人成群结党在街上抢夺单身男性的皮包，胆敢反抗，就被海扁一顿。这种传言颇可信。非洲盛产体型超级壮硕的男女，源自大量的劳力工作与低蛋白质的饮食。站在胸膛壮硕的南喀麦隆人面前，瘦弱的西方人顿时矮了一大截。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Travelling in West Africa seems to have much in common with travel by stage in early Westerns. There is a fairly standard cast. It seems much the same whether one is travelling by train or bush-taxi; the latter plays a major role in getting about inside the country. Bush-taxis are big Toyota or Saviem vans built to accommodate from twelve to twenty persons into which the proprietors seek to introduce between thirty and fifty. Should the vehicle give the false impression of bursting at the seams, a popular expedient is to drive off at speed and apply the brakes, which always makes room for one or two more at the back. It seems to be required that each vehicle shall contain a couple of army corporals or lieutenants. Gendarmes normally find themselves the best seats, beside the driver, and blandly refuse to pay for them. A couple of southern schoolteachers resentful at being sent to the Muslim North are standard. With but little prompting, they entertain the company with tales of their sufferings in that benighted area, denouncing the lack of entrepreneurial spirit, the savagery of the pagan inhabitants, the inedibility of the food. Then there will be a pagan woman in blue plastic shoes suckling a child, an operation that seems to involve most of the women full time. A couple of gaunt Muslims from the semi-desert of the North, swathed in Arab robes and clutching prayer mats and kettles of water, complete the assembly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在西非旅行很像在美国西部搭乘驿车。乘客类型颇固定。火车与丛林计程车乘客看起来都差不多。丛林计程车（bush taxi）是非洲乡间重要交通工具，通常是大型的丰田或萨维恩（Saviem）旅行车，原本是十二到二十人座，但是车主永远可以挤上三十到五十人。如果车子好像挤得要裂开来，权宜之计是加速前驶、紧急煞车，一阵东倒西歪后，永远可以再挤出一、二个位子。乘客阵容一定有几个下士或少尉。通常，宪兵可以坐到司机旁最好的位子，而且总是不必付钱。典型乘客还包括几个南部老师，痛恨被派到信奉伊斯兰教的北部教书。毋需任何鼓励，他们便自动娱乐乘客，滔滔不绝叙述在蒙昧无知的北方如何受苦，那里的老百姓毫无上进心，异教徒多野蛮，食物多么难以下咽。乘客中也总有趿着蓝色塑胶拖鞋的异教徒女性，敞开胸部奶孩子，这似乎是此间女性一日到头在干的活。再加上几个来自北方半沙漠地区、身材瘦长、手上拎着祈祷用的席子与水壶的穆斯林，就构成了乘客阵容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So it was with the train. A technological development much appreciated by the locals is the cassette radio, so that a man may record a wavering cacophony broadcast through a thick hiss and crackle of atmospherics and play it back in public at high volume over and over again. There is always a competition between northern Muslims and southern Christians to establish prior rights to airspace. Winning this contest gives one the exclusive right to play one's cassette regardless of the hour and determines whether the theme shall be the interminable tuneless West African pop of Nigerian pijin ("O me mammy I don' forget you") or indigenous products ("Je suis un enfant de Douala olé") or the raucous wailing of Arab-style confections. Stopping for even a moment is interpreted as allowing the opposition its chance and is therefore discouraged. The principal difference between those areas of a city populated by local bureaucrats or foreign envoys is that of noise level. Africans seem genuinely perplexed by the Westerner's predilection for creeping around in silence when presumably he could afford enough batteries to have his radio playing day and night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火车乘客也大致如此。喀麦隆人最欣赏的现代科技之一是收录音机，他们可以录下被静电干扰得撕嘶作响、哔啪嘈杂、声音颤抖不协和的广播，然后以极高分贝一遍又一遍公开播放。北方的穆斯林与南方基督徒总是激烈竞争空中优先占用权。胜利者可以独家播放他的卡带，不管什么时辰，也不管他爱放的是冗长、平板的西非流行音乐——尼日利亚混合语（pijin）流行歌曲《噢，难忘的母亲》、本地流行歌曲《我是一个杜阿拉欧雷的小孩》，或者是刺耳呻吟的阿拉伯风格甜腻音乐。音乐播放只要稍有空档，即代表奉送对手机会，绝不可以。喀麦隆城市里，本地官员与外交人员住宅区的最大差别在于噪音量。非洲人常很困惑西方人为何那么爱安静，他们分明有钱可买足够电池，日夜不停播放收音机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On this particular trip I sat opposite a German agriculturalist heading north for his second term of duty. He was, he revealed, in charge of a project to encourage the cultivation of cotton for export. Cotton is sold through a government monopoly and earns much-needed foreign exchange, so its production is heavily supported by central government. Had he been successful? Wildly so; in fact the people had spent so much time growing cotton that they had grown no food, prices had rocketed and a famine had only been averted by the intervention of the church relief projects. Strangely, he seemed in no way depressed by this outcome, taking it rather as a sign that cotton had come to stay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻我对面坐着一位德国农业专家，前往北方履行后半段任期。据言，他负责推广外销棉花种植。棉花外销是国家专卖，用来赚取喀国亟需的外汇，中央政府十分鼓励农民种植。这位农业专家的推广计划成功吗？疯狂成功！事实上，农民花太多时间种植棉花，忽视粮食作物生产，不仅粮食价格飙涨，还造成饥荒，全靠教会的救援计划才使百姓免于饿死。奇怪的是，德国农业专家对此结果并不沮丧，认为这证明棉花种植在喀麦隆已经生根。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another basic difference between Christian and Muslim is that the Christian males urinate standing up and are thus quite able to reach the sink in the washroom for that purpose, whereas Muslims urinate squatting, a process effected with dreadful risk by spreading out their robes to a capacious tent and half leaning out of the open door of the moving carriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督徒与穆斯林的另一大差别是小便方式。基督徒男性站着小便，使用火车上的便池十分方便。穆斯林男性却是蹲着小便，必须在快速行驶的火车上，把袍子拉开如帐篷，身体半悬出车门外解决，十分恐怖危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During my time in Cameroon I met many such specialists, some of whom reproached me bitterly for being a "parasite on African culture". They had come to share knowledge, to change peoples' lives. I was only there to observe and might, by my interest, encourage pagan superstition and backwardness. Sometimes, in the silent watches of the night, I too wondered about that, just as in England I had wondered about the point of an academic life. However, when it came to the crunch they seemed to accomplish very little. For every problem they solved they created two more. I rather felt that it was people who claimed to be the sole possessors of the truth who should be ill at ease for the disruption they caused in others' lives. At least one can say of the anthropologist that he is a harmless drudge, it being one of the professed ethics of the trade to interfere directly as little as possible in what one observes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在喀麦隆期间碰过不少这类专家，其中有人恶毒批评我为“非洲文化的寄生虫”。他们是来分享知识，改善人民生活的。而我只是观察，还可能因个人的兴趣，鼓励此间百姓迷信异教与落伍。有时在寂寥的失眠夜里，我也如此质疑自己（一如我在英国时怀疑学术生活的价值一样）。不过，谈到解决危机，这些专家也没啥成就。他们每解决一个问题，便制造出两个问题。我常觉得那些自称握有真理的人应当为扰乱他人生活而良心不安。至于人类学家，不过是毫无害处的书呆子，这个行业的伦理之一便是尽量不直接干预观察对象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Such thoughts come to the fieldworker as he eats interminable bananas on a railway train. The journey, I'd been assured, would last three hours; in fact it took seventeen hours, but gradually the temperature dropped as we climbed the plateau towards the city of N'gaoundere. Night fell suddenly and the lights failed in the train. We sat in the gloom, eating bananas, talking broken German and watching the scrubby bush fade into blackness. Finally, when I'd begun to feel that I'd spend the rest of my life on this train, we arrived at N'gaoundere.</div>

<div class="line_en">Further south, these have been displaced totally by a passion for corrugated iron or aluminium sheeting, unbearably hot in the sun and acting as a vast radiator which ensures that night becomes as hot as day. These corrugated shanties contribute greatly to the ugliness of African cities to a Westerner's eyes. This is partly sheer ethnocentrism; while thatched huts are "picturesque and rustic", corrugated huts are "slums". N'gaoundere, however, was less immediately offensive than most African towns. In the dark, with hundreds of cooking fires glowing, it looked like a Westerner's view of Africa. In the daylight one sees the piles of rotting rubbish through which the gilded youth picks its way on mopeds adorned with plastic flowers.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is a widespread impression that missionaries have taken upon themselves the mantle of medieval hospitality to travellers. Some do, indeed, provide lodging but this is more likely to be for their own personnel flitting between conferences than for vapid wanderers. They have suffered greatly from penniless hitchhikers who expect to be able to live off the fat of Africa as easily as they do in Europe. Under their onslaught, hospitality has necessarily been curtailed; otherwise missions would find themselves exclusively in the hotel business.</div>

<div class="line_en">But for the moment, the German and I were totally absorbed in bargaining with a taxi driver. Whereas I would probably have accepted my historical role as someone to be robbed, the German devoted himself to haggling with the ferocity and apparent deep contempt for all taxi drivers that I came to note as the mark of a man who really knew his way around. The result was that we were delivered to the Catholic mission with minimum delay, at reasonable cost, and received warmly by the priests, whom he knew well.</div>

<div class="line_en">But I was eager to move on to the Protestant mission where I believed myself to be expected. With delays in documentation, I was now two months into my fieldwork time and had not even seen a Dowayo. I had a nagging fear they might not exist, the word "Dowayo' being a native term for "no one" that had been dutifully noted in answer to some district officer's question. "Who lives over there?" I inquired politely at the Catholic mission. Yes, it seemed the Dowayos did exist. Fortunately the Catholics had had very little to do with them, they were terrible people. At the school the Fathers ran they were always the very worst pupils. Why was I interested in working with Dowayos? The reason for their mode of life was simple: they were ignorant.</div>
