<div class="line_en">Jack parked the VW in front of the Rexall in the Table Mesa shopping center and let the engine die. He wondered again if he shouldn't go ahead and get the fuel pump replaced, and told himself again that they couldn't afford it. If the little car could keep running until November, it could retire with full honors anyway. By November the snow up there in the mountains would be higher than the beetle's roof… maybe higher than three beetles stacked on top of each other.</div>

He loved road maps, loved to trace where the roads went with his finger. As far as he was concerned, new maps were the best part of moving West.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克出去了，丹尼打开车内的工具箱，取出五张破旧的加油站地图：科罗拉多、内布拉斯加、尤他州、怀俄明、新墨西哥。他喜欢公路交通图，喜欢拿手指顺着公路走。对他来说，搬到西部来的最大好处就是有了这些新地图。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He supposed he could have made his obligatory thank-you call to Al from home; he certainly wasn't going to say anything Wendy would object to. It was his pride that said no. These days he almost always listened to what his pride told him to do, because along with his wife and son, six hundred dollars in a checking account, and one weary 1968 Volkswagen, his pride was all that was left. The only thing that was his. Even the checking account was joint. A year ago he had been teaching English in one of the finest prep schools in New England. There had been friends -- although not exactly the same ones he'd had before going on the wagon -- some laughs, fellow faculty members who admired his deft touch in the classroom and his private dedication to writing. Things had been very good six months ago. All at once there was enough money left over at the end of each two-week pay period to start a little savings account. In his drinking days there had never been a penny left over, even though Al Shockley had stood a great many of the rounds. He and Wendy had begun to talk cautiously about finding a house and making a down payment in a year or so. A farmhouse in the country, take six or eight years to renovate it completely, what the hell, they were young, they had time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，他本可以在家里给阿尔打这个必不可少的致谢电话；再说，他肯定不会讲温迪不愿听的话。说“不”的是他的自尊心。这些天，他的所作所为几乎全然听命于他的自尊心，因为，除了妻子儿子、支票账户里的600美元和一部1968年出厂的旧大众车，他剩下的就只有自尊了。这是唯一真正属于他自己的东西。连支票账户都是与别人共用的。一年前，他还在新英格兰最好的预备学校教英语。那时，他有朋友——虽然不尽是他戒酒前的那些——有欢笑，有佩服他在课堂上游刃有余的同事，还有他为之倾心的写作爱好。半年前，情况相当不错。两周一次的发薪日之前竟然一下子余下了足够的钱开一个小额储蓄账户。戒酒之前他从未存下一个子儿，尽管大多数时候是阿尔—肖克利掏的腰包。他和温迪已经开始小心翼翼地谈到找一所房子，在大约一年之内付现钱买下来。就找一处农舍，花上十年八年将它整修一新，急什么！他们还年轻，有的是时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack went to the drugstore counter, got Danny's candy bar, and newspaper, and a copy of the October Writer's Digest. He gave the girl a five and asked for his change in quarters. With the silver in his hand he walked over to the telephone booth by the keymaking machine and slipped inside. From here he could see Danny in the bug through three sets of glass. The boy's head was bent studiously over his maps. Jack felt a wave of nearly desperate love for the boy. The emotion showed on his face as a stony grimness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克来到杂货铺，给丹尼买了棒棒糖，还买了一份报纸、一本十月份的《作家文摘》。他给了小姐一张5元的钞票，让她找了几枚2角5分的硬币。他手里攥着硬币，来到一家配钥匙铺子旁边的电话亭，钻了进去。从这儿，透过三层玻璃，他可以看到待在车里的丹尼。孩子低着头，专心致志地看着地图。一阵爱意涌上杰克的心头，可是，他脸上的表情却异常冷峻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The smell of hope had turned to the smell of old leather in Crommert's office, the whole thing like some scene from his own play: the old prints of previous Stovington headmasters on the walls, steel engravings of the school as it had been in 1879, when it was first built, and in 1895, when Vanderbilt money had enabled them to build the field house that still stood at the west end of the soccer field, squat, immense, dressed in ivy. April ivy had been rustling outside Crommert's slit window and the drowsy sound of steam heat came from the radiator. It was no set, he remembered thinking. It was real. His life. How could he have fucked it up so badly?</div>

His hands shook. He knocked things over. And he kept wanting to take it out on Wendy and Danny. His temper was like a vicious animal on a frayed leash. He had left the house in terror that he might strike them. Had ended up outside a bar, and the only thing that had kept him from going in was the knowledge that if he did, Wendy would leave him at last, and take Danny with her. He would be dead from the day they left.</div>

<div class="line_en">Al's father had been Arthur Longley Shockley, the steel baron. He had left his only son, Albert, a fortune and a huge range of investments and directorships and chairs on various boards. One of these had been on the Board of Directors for Stovington Preparatory Academy, the old man's favorite charity. Both Arthur and Albert Shockley were alumni and Al lived in Barre, close enough to take a personal interest in the school's affairs. For several years Al had been Stovington's tennis coach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔的父亲是钢铁大王亚瑟—朗利—肖克利。他给独子阿尔伯特留下了大笔财产和领域广泛的投资，还有各种董事会成员和主席的头衔。其中之一就是斯托文顿预备学校校董会董事，这家学校是老人生前最喜欢的慈善机构。亚瑟和阿尔伯特都是该校校友，阿尔住在巴雷，离学校很近，因此对学校事务颇有兴趣。阿尔还当过几年学校的网球教练。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack and Al had become friends in a completely natural and uncoincidental way: at the many school and faculty functions they attended together, they were always the two drunkest people there. Shockley was separated from his wife, and Jack's own marriage was skidding slowly downhill, although he still loved Wendy and had promised sincerely (and frequently) to reform, for her sake and for baby Danny's.</div>

<div class="line_en">He hadn't believed he was an alcoholic, Jack thought as Al's telephone began ringing in his ear. The classes he had missed or taught unshaven, still reeking of last night's martians. Not me, I can stop anytime. The nights he and Wendy had passed in separate beds. Listen, I'm fine. Mashed fenders. Sure I'm okay to drive. The tears she always shed in the bathroom. Cautious looks from his colleagues at any party where alcohol was served, even wine. The slowly dawning realization that he was being talked about. The knowledge that he was producing nothing at his Underwood but balls of mostly blank paper that ended up in the wastebasket. He had been something of a catch for Stovington, a slowly blooming American writer perhaps, and certainly a man well qualified to teach that great mystery, creative writing. He had published two dozen short stories. He was working on a play, and thought there might be a novel incubating in some mental back room. But now he was not producing and his teaching had become erratic.</div>

<div class="line_en">If the bender had occurred on a weeknight, he would sleep for three hours, get up, dress, chew four Excedrins, and go off to teach his nine o'clock American Poets still drunk.

<div class="line_en">The two of them went on from many faculty parties, hitting the bars until they closed, then stopping at some mom 'n' pot) store for a case of beer they would drink parked at the end of some back road. There were mornings when Jack would stumble into their leased house with dawn seeping into the sky and find Wendy and the baby asleep on the couch, Danny always on the inside, a tiny fist curled under the shelf of Wendy's jaw. He would look at them and the self-loathing would back up his throat in a bitter wave, even stronger than the taste of beer and cigarettes and martinis-martians, as Al called them. Those were the times that his mind would turn thoughtfully and sanely to the gun or the rope or the razor blade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩常常在教师聚会结束之后又跑到酒吧，直泡到打烊，然后到一家夫妻店搞一箱啤酒，把车停在某条僻静的巷子的尽头，又接着喝起来。有时候，天边已露出晨光，杰克才东倒西歪地闯进他们租住的房子，发现温迪和儿子睡在沙发上，丹尼总是在里侧，小拳头搭在温迪下巴上。每当看到此情此景，苦涩难当的自疚感便涌进他的嗓子眼里，比啤酒、烟草和马提尼酒——阿尔称之为马提安（原文意为火星人，后文中还多次用到——译者注）——的味道还浓烈。这样的时候他就会头脑十分清醒地想到枪、绳子或剃须刀片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been a little past midnight. Jack and Al were coming into Barre on U. S. 31, Al behind the wheel of his Jag, shifting fancily on the curves, sometimes crossing the double yellow line. They were both very drunk; the martians had landed that night in force. They came around the last curve before the bridge at seventy, and there was a kid's bike in the road, and then the sharp, hurt squealing as rubber shredded from the Jag's tires, and Jack remembered seeing Al's face looming over the steering wheel like a round white moon. Then the jingling crashing sound as they hit the bike at forty, and it had flown up like a bent and twisted bird, the handlebars striking the windshield, and then it was in the air again, leaving the starred safety glass in front of Jack's bulging eyes. A moment later he heard the final dreadful smash as it landed on the road behind them. Something thumped underneath them as the tires passed over it. The Jag drifted around broadside, Al still jockeying the wheel, and from far away Jack heard himself saying: "Jesus, Al. We ran him down. I felt it." In his ear the phone kept ringing. Come on, Al. Be home. Let me get this over with.</div>
