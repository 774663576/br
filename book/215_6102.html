<div class="line_en">I beat it into the kitchen and poured myself a killer bowl of corn flakes. And I was about to drown it in milk when my mother comes waltzing in and snags it away from me. "You are going to wait, young man," she says. "This family is going to have Sunday breakfast together."</div>

<div class="line_en">I shook it off, all right, and got out of bed early 'cause I had eaten almost nothing the night before and I was starving! But as I was trucking into the kitchen, I glanced into the family room and noticed that my dad was sacked out on the couch.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="早餐的时候我爸爸看起来不像是整晚都在沙发上度过。他没有眼袋，下巴上也没有胡子。他穿了一条网球短裤和一件淡紫色马球衫，而他的头发被吹得膨胀起来，好像这是个工作日。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Granddad ate plenty, even for him, but I couldn't tell what he was thinking. He was back to looking more granite than human.

Those rotten eggs were back from the grave, looming large and smelly right over my head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, as I was brushing my teeth, I considered bribing Juli. Getting her on board so that nobody brought up the subject of eggs. Or maybe I could sabotage the dinner somehow.

<div class="line_en">So. They were coming. And it made seeing Juli at school even more uncomfortable than usual. Not because she gushed about it or even waved and winked or something. No, she was back to avoiding me. She'd say hi if we happened to run into each other, but instead of being, like, right over my shoulder anytime I looked, she was nowhere. She must have ducked out back doors and taken roundabout ways through campus. She was, I don't know, scarce.</div>
