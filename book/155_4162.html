<div class="line_en">The street light on the corner cast sharp shadows on the Radley house. I heard Jem laugh softly. "Bet nobody bothers them tonight," he said. Jem was carrying my ham costume, rather awkwardly, as it was hard to hold. I thought it gallant of him to do so.</div>

<div class="line_en">High above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in blissful unawareness of whose tree he sat in, plunging from the shrill kee, kee of the sunflower bird to the irascible qua-ack of a bluejay, to the sad lament of Poor Will, Poor Will, Poor Will.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had slowed to a cautious gait, and were feeling our way forward so as not to bump into the tree. The tree was a single and ancient oak; two children could not reach around its trunk and touch hands. It was far away from teachers, their spies, and curious neighbors: it was near the Radley lot, but the Radleys were not curious. A small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many fights and furtive crap games.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we reached the auditorium, the whole town was there except Atticus and the ladies worn out from decorating, and the usual outcasts and shut-ins. Most of the county, it seemed, was there: the hall was teeming with slicked-up country people. The high school building had a wide downstairs hallway; people milled around booths that had been installed along each side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们进了礼堂。嗬，全城的人，除了阿迪克斯、几位下午布置礼堂秀得精疲力竭的妇女和那些通常在外流浪的人阻及卧病不出门的人，其余都在这儿呢。似乎全县大多数的人都在这儿：大厅里挤满了打扮得漂漂亮亮的乡下人。学校这幢房子的楼下有宽阔的过道，过道两边临时搭起了各式各样的货摊子，拥挤的人群在这些摊子周围，转来转去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was an excellent idea, Jem thought. He also thought it a good thing that Cecil and I would be together. This way, Jem would be left to go with people his own age.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How much money you got?" I asked Cecil. Cecil had thirty cents, too, which made us even. We squandered our first nickels on the House of Horrors, which scared us not at all; we entered the black seventh-grade room and were led around by the temporary ghoul in residence and were made to touch several objects alleged to be component parts of a human being. "Here's his eyes," we were told when we touched two peeled grapes on a saucer. "Here's his heart," which felt like raw liver. "These are his innards," and our hands were thrust into a plate of cold spaghetti.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你有多少钱？”我问塞西尔。他说他也有三角钱，刚好跟我一样多。我们首先各自拿出五分钱镍币进了“恐怖宫”，可是在里面一点也不觉得恐怖；我们又进了漆黑的七年级教室，临时装扮的食尸鬼领着我们转了一圈，让我们摸着假设为人体组成部分的各种物品。我们摸到放在一只盘子里的两颗剥了皮的葡萄时，有人告诉我们说：“这是眼睛。”接着j兑：“这是心脏。”那心脏摸起来象没煮过的猪肝。接着又说：“这些是内脏，”我们双手插进了一盘冷面条。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cecil and I visited several booths. We each bought a sack of Mrs. Judge Taylor's homemade divinity. I wanted to bob for apples, but Cecil said it wasn't sanitary. His mother said he might catch something from everybody's heads having been in the same tub. "Ain't anything around town now to catch," I protested. But Cecil said his mother said it was unsanitary to eat after folks. I later asked Aunt Alexandra about this, and she said people who held such views were usually climbers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和塞西尔到了几个货摊子，一人买了一袋泰勒法官太太家制的软糖。我想去玩咬苹果游戏，但塞西尔说那不卫生。他妈说，玩那种游戏每个人的头都伸到同一个盆里，可能染上什么病。“现在，城里没有流行什么传染病啊。”我提出不同的意见。但是塞西尔说，他妈说了，别人咬了后再去咬不卫生。后来，我问亚历山德拉姑妈，她说，有这种看法的人通常是些想向上爬的人。，">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="后台上，我和塞西尔发现那狭窄的过道上挤满了人：大人们有的戴着家制的三角帽，有的戴着南部邦联帽，有的戴着美西战争帽，有的戴世界大战钢盔。儿童们装扮成五花八门的农产品，聚集在唯一的小窗前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The band played the national anthem, and we heard the audience rise. Then the bass drum sounded. Mrs. Merriweather, stationed behind her lectern beside the band, said: "Maycomb County Ad Astra Per Aspera." The bass drum boomed again. "That means," said Mrs. Merriweather, translating for the rustic elements, "from the mud to the stars." She added, unnecessarily, it seemed to me, "A pageant."</div>

<div class="line_en">The bass drum went boom with every sentence Mrs. Merriweather uttered. She chanted mournfully about Maycomb County being older than the state, that it was a part of the Mississippi and Alabama Territories, that the first white man to set foot in the virgin forests was the Probate Judge's great-grandfather five times removed, who was never heard of again. Then came the fearless Colonel Maycomb, for whom the county was named.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里韦瑟太太每讲一句，大鼓响一阵。她哀婉动人地说，梅科姆县的历史比亚拉巴马州更悠久，原来处于密西西比准州和亚拉巴马准州之间；在这一片原始森林内留下第一个脚印的白人是遗嘱法官的曾祖的五代祖，再也没听见人家谈起过他了。然后，她说到英勇无畏的梅科姆上校，这个县就是以他的名字命名的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Andrew Jackson appointed him to a position of authority, and Colonel Maycomb's misplaced self-confidence and slender sense of direction brought disaster to all who rode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. Colonel Maycomb persevered in his efforts to make the region safe for democracy, but his first campaign was his last. His orders, relayed to him by a friendly Indian runner, were to move south. After consulting a tree to ascertain from its lichen which way was south, and taking no lip from the subordinates who ventured to correct him, Colonel Maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to rout the enemy and entangled his troops so far northwest in the forest primeval that they were eventually rescued by settlers moving inland.</div>

How he could tell I was feeling bad under my costume I don't know, but he said I did all right, I just came in a little late, that was all.

<div class="line_en">A car stopped in front of the house. I knew Dr. Reynolds's step almost as well as my father's.

Dr. Reynolds said if we had been boil-prone things would have been different, but we doubted it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No-o!" Dr. Reynolds got to his feet. "We can't do much tonight," he said, "except try to make him as comfortable as we can.

<div class="line_en">"Yes sir." I retreated. Jem's room was large and square. Aunt Alexandra was sitting in a rocking-chair by the fireplace. The man who brought Jem in was standing in a corner, leaning against the wall. He was some countryman I did not know. He had probably been at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it happened.

<div class="line_en">Dr. Reynolds's step was young and brisk. Mr. Heck Tate's was not. His heavy boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly, but he said the same thing Dr. Reynolds said when he came in. "You all right, Scout?" he added.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aunt Alexandra had shaded Jem's reading light with a towel, and his room was dim. Jem was lying on his back. There was an ugly mark along one side of his face. His left arm lay out from his body; his elbow was bent slightly, but in the wrong direction. Jem was frowning.</div>

I wondered why Atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the corner, but Atticus knew the ways of country people far better than I.

This one was probably more comfortable where he was.</div>
