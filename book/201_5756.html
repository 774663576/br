<div class="line_en">Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees to the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, Harry's frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle's secret passageways, so that he was often, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种绕道以前会让罗恩感到嫉妒而不是开心，现在他却只是哈哈大笑。虽然哈利觉得这个嘻嘻哈哈的新罗恩比前几星期那个郁闷、好斗的罗恩好得多，可这改变却也代价高昂。首先，哈利不得不经常看到拉文德·布朗，这女孩似乎把不亲吻罗恩的每一刻都当做浪费；第二，哈利再次成了两个似乎要永远不跟对方说话的人的好朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermione's schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, So Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏的时间表太满，哈利到晚上才能跟她正经说上话，反正这时罗恩被拉文德缠得紧紧的，顾不到哈利在干什么。只要有罗恩在，赫敏就不肯坐在公共休息室里，所以哈利一般到图书馆去找她，这意味着谈话要悄悄地进行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They didn't have the potions with them in the bathroom," said Hermione scornfully, "They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt the Half-blood prince" she gave the book another scornful look "could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I'd just invite someone to go with you, that'll stop all the others thinking they've still got a chance. It's tomorrow night, they're getting desperate."</div>

They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again.

The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.</div>

It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn's office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons… or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin common room… Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!" said Snape. "Where do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一场对成功非常关键的戏，德拉科！”斯内普说，“如果我不会演戏，你想我这些年会在哪儿？听我说！你现在很不谨慎，夜里到处乱走，被人当场抓住，还有，如果你依赖克拉布和高尔这样的助手——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would've had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn't put them in detention!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Keep your voice down!" spat Snape, for Malfoy 's voice had risen excitedly. "If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小点儿声！”斯内普警告道，因为马尔福这时激动得提高了嗓门，“你的朋友克拉布和高尔这次要想通过黑魔法防御术的O.W。Ls考试，还得多下点儿功夫——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had barely a second 's warning; he heard Malfoy's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open. Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorns office, around the distant corner, and out of sight. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利几乎连一秒钟的思想准备都没有，就听到马尔福的脚步声在门那边响起。他赶紧闪到一边，门已砰地打开了，马尔福大步朝走廊那头走去，经过斯拉格霍恩办公室敞开的门口，转过拐角不见了。哈利大气不敢出，继续蹲伏着，斯内普慢慢走出教室，表情深不可测，回去参加晚会了。哈利蹲在隐形衣下，脑子飞快地转动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
