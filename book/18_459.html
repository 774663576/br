<div class="line_en">"No," said Coraline. "I brought a friend." She could feel the cat stiffening under her hands, as if it were anxious to be away. Coraline wanted to hold on to it like a teddy bear, for reassurance, but she knew that cats hate to be squeezed, and she suspected that frightened cats were liable to bite and scratch if provoked in any way, even if they were on your side.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So you're back," said the other mother. She did not sound pleased. "And you brought vermin with you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have a very funny way of showing it," said Coraline. She walked down the hallway, then turned into the drawing room, steady step by steady step, pretending that she could not feel the other mother's blank black eyes on her back. Her grandmother's formal furniture was still there, and the painting on the wall of the strange fruit (but now the fruit in the painting had been eaten, and all that remained in the bowl was the browning core of an apple, several plum and peach stones, and the stem of what had formerly been a bunch of grapes). The lion-pawed table raked the carpet with its clawed wooden feet, as if it were impatient for something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你爱得太奇怪了。”卡萝兰说。她走下过道，一拐弯，进了客厅。她步子迈得很稳，另一个妈妈的两只黑纽扣眼睛死死盯着她的后背，但卡萝兰假装没感觉到。奶奶以前的家具还在那儿，墙上还是挂着那幅奇怪的水果画。（但画里的水果已经被人吃掉了，水果碗里只剩下一个发黑的苹果核，几个李子核，桃核。那串葡萄只留下一根干干的葡萄枝。）那张矮木桌把它的狮子脚爪抓进地毯里，好像等得不耐烦，一心想朝谁扑过去一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once inside, in her flat, or rather, in the flat that was not hers, Coraline was pleased to see that it had not transformed into the empty drawing that the rest of the house seemed to have become. It had depth and shadows, and someone who stood in the shadows waiting for Coraline to return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进了自己的卧室。或者说，进了这间不是自己的卧室。卡萝兰高兴地看到，这间屋子并没有像宅子的其他部分一样，变成一幅铅笔画。它有景深，有阴影，阴影里还站着一个人，等着卡萝兰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the room, in the corner, stood the wooden door, which had once, in another place, opened on to a plain brick wall. Coraline tried not to stare at it. The window showed nothing but mist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客厅尽头的角落里，是那扇木头门。从前，在另一个世界，这扇木头门后面只有一堵平平常常的砖墙。卡萝兰尽量不朝它看。窗户外面什么都没有，只有一片白蒙蒙的雾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was it, Coraline knew. The moment of truth. The unravelling time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Coraline leaned against an armchair, adjusted the cat with her left hand, put her right hand into her pocket, and pulled out the three glass marbles. They were a frosted grey, and they clinked together in the palm of her hand. The other mother reached her white fingers out for them, but Coraline slipped them back into her pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰靠在一把扶手椅上，左手把猫抱得舒服些，右手伸进口袋，掏出三颗弹子。弹子是灰色的，像蒙了一层霜，在她手里撞得格格响。另一个妈妈伸出苍白的手指头，可卡萝兰已经把它们重新放回口袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other mother had followed her in. Now she stood in the centre of the room, between Coraline and the mantelpiece, and looked down at Coraline with black-button eyes. It was funny, Coraline thought. The other mother did not look anything at all like her own mother. She wondered how she had ever been deceived into imagining a resemblance. The other mother was huge -- her head almost brushed the ceiling of the room -- and very pale, the colour of a spider's belly. Her hair writhed and twined about her head, and her teeth were sharp as knives…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个妈妈跟着她走进客厅。她站在房间正中，在卡萝兰和壁炉架之间，那双黑纽扣眼睛从上往下看着她。真奇怪，卡萝兰想。这会儿，另一个妈妈的样子完全不像她真正的妈妈。不知以前是怎么想的，竟会觉得她跟自己的妈妈挺像。另一个妈妈的个子大极了，脑袋都快顶上了天花板。还有，她全身惨白，是蜘蛛肚皮那种白色。她的头发绕着脑袋翻来卷去，她的牙齿好尖，像刀子…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Coraline. "I know where my parents are." The cat was heavy in her arms. She moved it forward, unhooking its claws from her shoulder as she did so.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So," Coraline continued, both hands wrapped firmly around the black cat, "I know where they have to be. You've hidden them in the passageway between the houses, haven't you? They are behind that door." She nodded her head towards the door in the corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以，”卡萝兰继续说，两手稳稳地抱着黑猫，“我知道他们在哪儿。你把他们藏在我家的宅子和这儿之间的那条通道里了，对不对？就在那扇门里面。”她脑袋冲着角落里那扇门点了点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other mother remained statue-still, but a hint of a smile crept back on to her face. "Oh, they are, are they?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她知道，她只能从这条路回家去。但进不进得去，全看另一个妈妈想不想显示显示她有多高明。要是她不仅想赢，还想炫耀一番，那就好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other mother reached her hand slowly into her apron pocket and produced the black iron key. The cat stirred uncomfortably in Coraline's arms, as if it wanted to get down. Just stay there for a few moments longer, she thought at it, wondering if it could hear her. I'll get us both home. I said I would. I promise. She felt the cat relax ever-so-slightly in her arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个妈妈的手慢慢伸进她的围谖口袋，掏出那把黑色的铸铁钥匙。猫不安地在卡萝兰怀里动起来，好像想跳下地。再安静一小会儿，她心里对它说，一小会儿就好。她心里一个劲儿劝说着，也不知道它听不听得见。我会让咱们全都回家去，我说过的，我保证。她感到，怀里的猫不动了，安静了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There," she said, waving her hands at the corridor. The expression of delight on her face was a very bad thing to see. "You're wrong! you don't know where your parents are, do you? They aren't there." She turned and looked at Coraline. "Now," she said, "You're going to stay here for ever and always."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看见没有？”她的手朝过道一挥，脸上那副得意的样子，难看死了，“你错了！你根本不知道你爸爸妈妈在哪儿，对不对？不在这儿。”她转过身，盯着卡萝兰，“现在，”她说，“你得永远留在这儿，再也走不了了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Coraline. I'm not." And, hard as she could, she threw the black cat towards the other mother. It yowled and landed on the other mother's head, claws flailing, teeth bared, fierce and angry. Fur on end, it looked half again as big as it was in real life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会，”卡萝兰说，“根本不会。”说完，她有多大力气使多大力气，把猫朝另一个妈妈狠狠一扔。猫一声嚎叫，落在另一个妈妈脑袋上，爪子乱抓，露出尖牙，样子凶极了。它的毛全部立起来，比它在真正的世界里大了足足一半。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cat made a deep, ululating yowl and sank its teeth into the other mother's cheek. She was flailing at it. Blood ran from the cuts on her white face -- not red blood, but a deep, tarry black stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫一声大叫，牙齿咬进另一个妈妈的脸。她扑打着它，血从白乎乎的脸上直往下淌。不，不是真正的血，是一种黑黑黏黏的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Leave her! Come on!" she shouted to the cat. It hissed, and swiped its scalpel-sharp claws at the other mother's face in one wild rake which left black ooze trickling from several gashes on her nose. Then it sprang down towards Coraline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“甩掉她，快过来！”她向猫喊。猫嘶嘶地叫了一声，锋利得像手术刀一样的猫爪一挥，在另一个妈妈脸上狠狠地又抓了一把。黑黑黏黏的东西马上从她鼻子上的几道伤口涌出来，慢慢向下流。接着，猫使劲一跳，跳下地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was colder in the corridor, like stepping down into a cellar on a warm day. The cat hesitated for a moment, then, seeing the other mother was coming towards them, it ran to Coraline and stopped by her legs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Coraline turned her back on the door and began to run, as fast as was practical, through the dark corridor, dragging her hand along the wall to make sure she didn't bump into anything or get turned around in the darkness. It was an uphill run, and it seemed to her that it went on for a longer distance than anything could possibly go. The wall she was touching seemed warm and yielding now, and, she realised, it felt as if it was covered in a fine downy fur. It moved, as if it were taking a breath.

<div class="line_en">And there was something else, which suddenly scuttled between her feet, nearly sending Coraline flying. She caught herself before she went down, using her own momentum to keep moving. She knew that if she fell in that corridor she might never get up again.

<div class="line_en">Then daylight appeared, and she ran towards it, puffing and wheezing. "Almost there," she called encouragingly, but in the light she discovered that the wraiths had gone, and she was alone. She did not have time to wonder what had happened to them.

<div class="line_en">The black cat was huddled in the farthest corner of the room, the pink tip of its tongue showing, its eyes wide. Coraline went over to it, and crouched down.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," she said. I'm sorry I threw you at her. But it was the only way to distract her enough to get us all out. She would never have kept her word, would she?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The light that came through the picture window was daylight, real golden late-afternoon daylight, not a white mist-light. The sky was a robin's-egg blue, and Coraline could see trees and, beyond the trees, green hills, which faded on the horizon into purples and greys. The sky had never seemed so sky; the world had never seemed so world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="描着花的窗户透进来一束光。外面是白天，真正的快傍晚的白天，不是白蒙蒙的雾。天蓝得像知更鸟的蛋，卡萝兰能看见树，树那边是小山，映在紫色的晚霞里。天空从来没有这么“天空”，世界也从来没有这么“世界”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰望着窗外的山毛榉，望着它的树叶，望着它被阳光照得斑斑驳驳的树干。然后，她低下头，望着膝盖上的猫。明亮的阳光照在猫头上，它的每一根毛都亮晶晶的，每一根白色的猫胡子都被染成了金色。">查看中文翻译</div>
