<div class="line_en">Back behind the benches, trading japes and making mock of the proceedings, stood a clot of westerners. Sellswords, Tyrion knew. He spied longswords, dirks and daggers, a brace of throwing axes, mail beneath their cloaks. Their hair and beards and faces marked most for men of the Free Cities, but here and there were a few who might have been Westerosi. Are they buying? Or did they just turn up for the show?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在长椅后面则站着一堆西方人，他们互相间就拍卖的过程打趣。雇佣骑士，提利昂知道。提利昂偷看着长剑、短剑、匕首、一对板斧，他们斗篷下的盔甲。他们的须发显示他们大多自由城邦的人，但是零星的有几个可能是维斯特洛伊人。你们会买么？又或仅仅为看场好戏？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The auction block had been thrown up where the broad brown Skahazadhan flowed into Slaver's Bay. Tyrion Lannister could smell the salt in the air, mingled with the stink from the latrine ditches behind the slave pens. He did not mind the heat so much as he did the damp. The very air seemed to weigh him down, like a warm wet blanket across his head and shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拍卖行高高地立于宽广的棕色Skahazadhan河与奴隶湾交汇的河口之上。提利昂·兰尼斯特闻到空气中咸咸的味道，混合着一股奴隶展栏后面茅坑散发的恶臭。闷湿比炎热更让他难受。这里的空气似乎像一条湿乎乎的毯子罩在他的头上和肩上，压迫着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bidders sat on wooden benches sipping fruit drinks. A few were being fanned by slaves. Many wore tokars, that peculiar garment beloved by the old blood of Slaver's Bay, as elegant as it was impractical. Others dressed more plainly -- men in tunics and hooded cloaks, women in colored silks. Whores or priestesses, most like; this far east it was hard to tell the two apart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="买家坐在木制长椅上品味着果汁。有些有奴隶在旁扇扇吹风，而很多则穿着托卡，这是种深受奴隶湾的古老血统们欢迎的独特服饰，虽然他们华而不实。其他人则穿着普通——男人们穿着短上衣、披兜帽斗篷，女人们则穿着染色的丝绸。是妓女还是修女，看起来都差不多；在这远东地带很难把他们分开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The slave sailors off the Selaesori Qhoran, sold singly, had gone for prices ranging from five hundred to nine hundred pieces of silver. Seasoned seamen were a valuable commodity. None had put up any sort of fight when the slav ers boarded their crippled cog. For them this was just a change of owner. The ship's mates had been free men, but the widow of the waterfront had written them a binder, promising to stand their ransom in such a case as this. The three surviving fiery fingers had not been sold yet, but they were chattels of the Lord of Light and could count on being bought back by some red temple. The flames tattooed upon their faces were their binders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Selaesori Qhoran号的奴隶水手论个卖，价格从500到900不等。经验丰富的海员可是珍贵的货品。他们在奴隶贩子登上他们的破船上后没有一个人反抗，对于他们来说这一切仅仅意味着换一个主人。船上的大副都是自由人，而河滨的寡妇为他们写过契约书，若他们遇到这种情况，她会赎回他们。三个幸存的燃烧手指还没被卖掉，但是他们都是光之王的奴仆，可以指望有红神庙会买回他们。他们脸上的火焰刺青就是他们的契约书。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Three hundred," bid a matron on an antique palanquin. "Four," called a monstrously fat Yunkishman from the litter where he sprawled like a leviathan. Covered all in yellow silk fringed with gold, he looked as large as four Illyrios. Tyrion pitied the slaves who had to carry him. At least we will be spared that duty. What joy to be a dwarf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“300，”一个坐在轿子上的妇人出价。“400，”一个像海怪一样摊据着一个轿子的极端肥胖的渊凯人出声加价。他穿着坠着金子的黄色丝绸，看起来足有四个伊利里欧那么大。提利昂有点为不得不抬着他的奴隶而悲哀。至少我们不会用来干这个，作个侏儒真好。">查看中文翻译</div>

The auctioneer had the scent, though, and nothing would do but that the dwarfs give the crowd a taste of their show. Crunch and Pretty Pig were led up onto the platform. Without saddles or bridles, mounting them proved tricky. The moment the sow began to move Tyrion slid off her rump and landed on his own, provoking gales of laughter from the bidders.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion gave Penny's shoulder a squeeze. Strands of hair, pale blond and black, clung to his brow, the rags of his tunic to his back. Some of that was sweat, some dried blood. He had not been so foolish as to fight the slavers, as Jorah Mormont had, but that did not mean he had escaped punishment. In his case it was his mouth that earned him lashes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂按了按佩妮的肩。淡金色和黑色的头发粘在他的额头，破烂的衣服粘在背上。有些地方是汗，有些地方是结痂了的血。他可没有蠢到像乔拉·莫尔蒙那样去和奴隶贩子搏斗，但这并不是说他没受到惩罚。祸从口出，狠赚一鞭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And what would a sellsword want with a dwarf? Tyrion pushed himself back to his feet to get a better look.

<div class="line_en">"Three thousand." The brown-skinned man pushed through the crowd, his fellow sellswords shoving buyers aside to clear a path. Yes. Come closer. Tyrion knew how to deal with sellswords. He did not think for a moment that this man wanted him to frolic at feasts. He knows me. He means to take me back to Westeros and sell me to my sister. The dwarf rubbed his mouth to hide his smile. Cersei and the Seven Kingdoms were half a world away. Much and more could happen before he got there. I turned Bronn. Give me half a chance, might be I could turn this one too.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="老太婆和盾牌上的女孩在3000银币这个价位放弃了，但是穿黄色的胖子没有。他用黄色的眼睛打量着雇佣骑士，用舌头弹了弹牙，说，“5000银币。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"I offer all the gold of Casterly Rock."</div>

<div class="line_en">He heard the whip before he felt it, a whistle in the air, thin and sharp. Tyrion grunted under the blow, but this time he managed to stay on his feet. His thoughts flashed back to the beginnings of his journey, when his most pressing problem had been deciding which wine to drink with his midmorning snails. See what comes of chasing dragons. A laugh burst from his lips, spattering the first row of buyers with blood and spit.</div>

She had taken a Meereenese slaver as her king, as wealthy as he was noble, and when the peace was signed and sealed the fighting pits of Meereen would open once again. Other slaves insisted that the guards were lying, that Daenerys Targaryen would never make peace with slavers. Mhysa, they called her. Someone told him that meant Mother.

<div class="line_en">Afterward, Nurse had Ser Jorah's chains fastened to a stake near the cookfire whilst he escorted the two dwarfs inside the master's pavilion and showed them where they would sleep, in a carpeted alcove separated from the main tent by walls of yellow silk. They would share this space with Yezzan's other treasures: a boy with twisted, hairy "goat legs," a two-headed girl out of Mantarys, a bearded woman, and a willowy creature called Sweets who dressed in moonstones and Myrish lace. "You are trying to decide if I'm a man or woman," Sweets said, when she was brought before the dwarfs. Then she lifted her skirts and showed them what was underneath. "I'm both, and master loves me best."</div>

Yezzan's name was incised into the metal in Valyrian glyphs, and a pair of tiny bells were affixed below the ears, so the wearer's every step produced a merry little tinkling sound. Jorah Mormont accepted his collar in a sullen silence, but Penny began to cry as the armorer was fastening her own into place. "It's so heavy," she complained.</div>

As they waited their own turn to perform, he watched Yezzan and his guests. The human prune in the place of honor was evidently the Yunkish supreme commander, who looked about as formidable as a loose stool. A dozen other Yunkish lords attended him. Two sellsword captains were on hand as well, each accompanied by a dozen men of his company. One was an elegant Pentoshi, grey-haired and clad in silk but for his cloak, a ragged thing sewn from dozens of strips of torn, bloodstained cloth. The other captain was the man who'd tried to buy them that morning, the brown-skinned bidder with the salt-and-pepper beard. "Brown Ben Plumm," Sweets named him. "Captain of the Second Sons."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion had not mastered half of Groat's old tricks, but he could ride the sow, fall off when he was meant to, roll, and pop back onto his feet. All of that proved well received. The sight of little people running about drunk-enly and whacking at one another with wooden weapons appeared to be just as hilarious in a siege camp by Slaver's Bay as at Joffrey's wedding feast in King's Landing. Contempt, thought Tyrion, the universal tongue.</div>

The supreme commander appeared so frail that Tyrion was afraid laughing might kill him. When Penny's helm was struck off and flew into the lap of a sour-faced Yunkishman in a striped green-and-gold tokar, Yurkhaz cackled like a chicken. When said lord reached inside the helm and drew out a large purple melon dribbling pulp, he wheezed until his face turned the same color as the fruit.

Tyrion bit his tongue and kept on pouring.</div>
