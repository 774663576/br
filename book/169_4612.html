<div class="line_en">Lancel had taken to quartering the lion of Lannister with the Darry plowman, it would seem. He saw his uncle's hand in that, as in Lancel's choice of bride. House Darry had ruled these lands since the Andals cast down the First Men. No doubt Ser Kevan realized that his son would have an easier time of it if the peasants saw him as a continuation of the old line, holding these lands by right of marriage rather than royal decree. Kevan should be Tommen's Hand. Harys Swyft is a toad, and my sister is a fool if she thinks elsewise.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fields outside the walls of Darry were being tilled once more.

A dozen bearded men with axes stood guard over them as they worked.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the Mountain's men had tried to rape the girl at Harrenhal, and had seemed honestly perplexed when Jaime commanded Ilyn Payne to take his head off. "I had her before, a hunnerd times," he kept saying as they forced him to his knees. "A hunnerd times, m'lord. We all had her." When Ser Ilyn presented Pia with his head, she had smiled through her ruined teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Josmyn Peckleton was saying the same thing. "You must not judge by Harrenhal. Black Harren built too big." Pia listened as solemnly as a girl of five being lessoned by her septa. That's all she is, a little girl in a woman's body, scarred and scared. Peck was taken with her, though. Jaime suspected that the boy had never known a woman, and Pia was still pretty enough, so long as she kept her mouth closed. There's no harm in him bedding her, I suppose, so long as she's willing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔斯敏·派克顿也如此向她解释：“你不能以赫伦堡的标准来衡量，当年黑心赫伦的野心实在太大了。”皮雅严肃地受教，好像五岁的女孩听修女讲课似的。她不正是一个小女孩么？女人的外表，女孩的心，满怀恐惧，伤痕累累。小派对她很好，詹姆怀疑年轻的侍从从未接近过女生，而皮雅只要把嘴巴闭紧，还是很漂亮的。只要她愿意，他们俩睡睡没什么不好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Darry had changed hands several times during the fighting, and its castle had been burned once and sacked at least twice, but Lancel had seemingly wasted little time setting things to rights. The castle gates were newly hung, raw oaken planks reinforced with iron studs. A new stable was going up where an older one had been put to the torch. The steps to the keep had been replaced, and the shutters on many of the windows. Blackened stones showed where the flames had licked, but time and rain would fade those.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五王之战中，戴瑞城屡次易主，它被烧毁过一次，被洗劫过至少两次，但蓝赛尔已经迅速地着手修复。城门是新铸的，刚砍伐的橡木板用钢钉加固，烧焦的马厩原址盖起了一座新马厩，堡垒的木阶和若干窗户也都重新换过。虽然黑黝黝的石头在无言地诉说着往日的大火，但时间和雨水终究会洗去伤痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Darry was on my way," lied Jaime. Riverrun will keep. And if perchance the siege had ended before he reached the castle, he would be spared the need to take up arms against House Tully. Dismounting, he handed Honor to a stableboy. "Will I find my uncle here?" He did not supply a name. Ser Kevan was the only uncle he had left, the last surviving son of Tytos Lannister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我顺道过来瞧瞧而已。”詹姆撒谎道。我不想去奔流城。如果城堡在他抵达之前就告沦陷，他便不必背上背誓反对徒利家的黑锅。他翻身下马，把坐骑交给马房小弟。“我叔叔何在？”无须指名道姓，凯冯爵士是他仅存的叔叔，也是泰陀斯·兰尼斯特唯一剩下的儿子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within the walls, crossbowmen walked the ramparts, some in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms, others in the blue and grey of House Frey. As Jaime trotted across the yard, chickens ran out from under Honor's hooves, sheep bleated, and peasants stared at him with sullen eyes. Armed peasants, he did not fail to note. Some had scythes, some staves, some hoes sharpened to cruel points. There were axes in evidence as well, and he spied several bearded men with red, seven-pointed stars sewn onto ragged, filthy tunics. More bloody sparrows. Where do they all come from?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城墙之内，十字弓手们在城垛上巡逻，有的戴狮盔披绯红披风，有的穿佛雷家族的蓝灰服饰。詹姆在庭院中策马小跑，小鸡在荣誉的蹄边四散逃命，绵羊咩咩叫，农民们闷闷不乐地打量他。他们都有武器，农民装备着镰刀、棍棒、削尖的锄头等等，甚至有斧头，有些不修边幅的男人在他们褴褛肮脏的外套上缝着红色七芒星。又是该死的麻雀，他们怎么会聚集在这里？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know the way." Jaime was no stranger to this castle. He and Cersei had been guests here twice before, once on their way to Winterfell with Robert, and again on the way back to King's Landing. Though small as castles went, it was larger than an inn, with good hunting along the river. Robert Baratheon had never been never loath to impose upon the hospitality of his subjects.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我识得路。”詹姆对这座城堡并不陌生，他和瑟曦两度在此留宿，起初是和劳勃一起去临冬城访问，回程时又在这里发生了大事件。这座城很小，但好歹比旅馆舒适，而且河边是打猎的好场所一劳勃·拜拉席恩最流连的就是这点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Piety and devotion. It was all he could do not to laugh. The walls had been bare on his first visit too. Tyrion had pointed out the squares of darker stone where tapestries had once hung. Ser Raymun could remove the hangings, but not the marks they'd left. Later, the Imp had slipped a handful of stags to one of Darry's serving men for the key to the cellar where the missing tapestries were hidden. He showed them to Jaime by the light of a candle, grinning; woven portraits of all the Targaryen kings, from the first Aegon to the second Aenys. "If I tell Robert, mayhaps he'll make me Lord of Darry," the dwarf said, chortling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修养和虔诚。他好不容易才忍住笑。从前造访时墙上也是一片空白，但提利昂指出黑色方石上有织锦悬挂的痕迹。雷蒙爵士移走了装饰，却抹不去蛛丝马迹，小恶魔甚至花一把银鹿买通仆人，拿到了收藏织锦的地窖的钥匙。烛光下，他咧嘴笑着指给詹姆看，原来那是坦格利安历代君王的群像，从征服者伊耿直到疯王伊里斯。“如果我向劳勃告密，说不定他会封我为戴瑞城伯爵呢。”侏儒嘻嘻笑道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sleeping with the Mother and the Maiden, when he has a warm wife just through that door? Jaime did not know whether to laugh or weep. Maybe he is praying for his cock to harden. In King's Landing it had been rumored that Lancel's wounds had left him incapable. Still, he ought to have sense enough to try. His cousin's hold on his new lands would not be secure until he fathered a son on his half-Darry wife. Jaime had begun to rue the impulse that had brought him here. He gave thanks to Ottomore, reminded him about the bath, and had Peck see him out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老婆就住在隔壁，却要去挨着圣母和少女睡？詹姆不知该哭还是该笑。或许他在祈祷自己那活儿坚强起来？君临城内传说，蓝赛尔的伤势让他失去了男人的能力。就算是这样，他也该试着去“重振雄风”呀。须知，表弟的新封号是不巩固的，除非他和自己那有戴瑞血统的老婆产下子嗣。詹姆有些懊悔来此地的冲动了。他对奥托莫表示感谢，并要他准备好洗澡水，再让小派去帮忙。">查看中文翻译</div>

Old stale rushes covered the floor in place of the fine Myrish carpet that had been there previously, and all the furnishings were new and crudely made. Ser Raymun Darry's bed had been large enough to sleep six, with brown velvet draperies and oakwood posts carved with vines and leaves; Lancel's was a lumpy straw pallet, placed beneath the window where the first light of day would be sure to wake him. The other bed had no doubt been burned or smashed or stolen, but even so…</div>

<div class="line_en">He was grateful when the bath was deep enough to conceal his arousal. As he lowered himself into the steaming water, he recalled another bath, the one he'd shared with Brienne. He had been feverish and weak from loss of blood, and the heat had made him so dizzy he found himself saying things better left unsaid. This time he had no such excuse. Remember your vows. Pia is more fit for Tyrion's bed than yours. "Fetch me soap and a stiff brush," he told Peck. "Pia, you may leave us."</div>

<div class="line_en">When the tub arrived, Little Lew pulled off Jaime's boots and helped remove his golden hand. Peck and Garrett hauled water, and Pia found him something clean to sup in. The girl glanced at him shyly as she shook his doublet out. Jaime was uncomfortably aware of the curve of hip and breast beneath her roughspun brown dress. He found himself remembering the things that Pia had whispered to him at Harrenhal, the night that Qyburn sent her to his bed. Sometimes when I'm with some man, she'd said, I close my eyes and pretend it's you on top of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="澡盆端来后，小个子卢替詹姆脱了靴子，解开金手，小派和加列特负责提水，而皮雅为他拿来点心。替他脱外套时，女孩羞涩地笑了，詹姆则不自在地透过她的粗布褐裙服，打量起乳房和臀部的曲线。他想起了赫伦堡那一夜，科本派她来服侍他时说的话。后来我和许多男人睡过，皮雅轻声软语，每次我都闭上眼睛，假装那是你。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he descended for the feast that night, Jaime Lannister wore a doublet of red velvet slashed with cloth-of-gold, and a golden chain studded with black diamonds. He had strapped on his golden hand as well, polished to a fine bright sheen. This was no fit place to wear his whites. His duty awaited him at Riverrun; a darker need had brought him here.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My lord prefers to fast," said Lancel's wife, the Lady Amerei. "He's sick with grief for the poor High Septon." She was a long-legged, full-breasted, strapping girl of some eight-and-ten years; a healthy wench to look at her, though her pinched, chinless face reminded Jaime of his late and unlamented cousin Cleos, who had always looked somewhat like a weasel. Fasting? He is an even bigger fool than I suspected. His cousin should be busy fathering a little weasel-faced heir on his widow instead of starving himself to death. He wondered what Ser Kevan might have had to say about his son's new fervor. Could that be the reason for his uncle's abrupt departure?</div>

The sparrows had gathered round a dozen cookfires to warm their hands against the chill of dusk and watch fat sausages spit and sizzle above the flames. There had to be a hundred of them. Useless mouths. Jaime wondered how many sausages his cousin had laid by and how he intended to feed the sparrows once they were gone. They will be eating rats by winter, unless they can get a harvest in. This late in autumn, the chances of another harvest were not good.</div>

<div class="line_en">For honor, Jaime might have said. For glory. That would have been a lie, though. Honor and glory had played their parts, but most of it had been for Cersei.

<div class="line_en">He glanced about the sept, at the gods. The Mother, full of mercy. The Father, stern in judgment. The Warrior, one hand upon his sword. The Stranger in the shadows, his half-human face concealed beneath a hooded mantle. I thought that I was the Warrior and Cersei was the Maid, but all the time she was the Stranger, hiding her true face from my gaze. "Pray for me, if you like," he told his cousin. "I've forgotten all the words."</div>

<div class="line_en">The castle yard was full of eyes and ears. To escape them, they sought out Darry's godswood. There were no sparrows there, only trees bare and brooding, their black branches scratching at the sky. A mat of dead leaves crunched beneath their feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you see that window, ser?" Jaime used a sword to point. "That was Raymun Darry's bedchamber. Where King Robert slept, on our return from Winterfell. Ned Stark's daughter had run off after her wolf savaged Joff, you'll recall. My sister wanted the girl to lose a hand. The old penalty, for striking one of the blood royal. Robert told her she was cruel and mad. They fought for half the night… well, Cersei fought, and Robert drank. Past midnight, the queen summoned me inside. The king was passed out snoring on the Myrish carpet. I asked my sister if she wanted me to carry him to bed. She told me I should carry her to bed, and shrugged out of her robe. I took her on Raymun Darry's bed after stepping over Robert. If His Grace had woken I would have killed him there and then. He would not have been the first king to die upon my sword… but you know that story, don't you?" He slashed at a tree branch, shearing it in half. "As I was fucking her, Cersei cried, 'I want.' I thought that she meant me, but it was the Stark girl that she wanted, maimed or dead." The things I do for love. "It was only by chance that Stark's own men found the girl before me. If I had come on her first…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看见那扇窗户了吗，爵士？”詹姆举剑指去，“那是雷蒙·戴瑞爵士的卧房。我们从临冬城返回时，劳勃国王就睡在里面，你不记得吗？当初奈德·史塔克的女儿放狼去咬小乔。我姐姐想要那小女孩一只手，这是前朝惯例，对王族动手者，处斩手之刑。劳勃认为她既残酷又疯狂，他们争斗了半夜…好吧，瑟曦动手，劳勃喝酒。午夜过后，王后召我觐见，国王已在密尔地毯上打起了呼噜。我问姐姐要不要把他抱回床上，她告诉我把她抱上床，然后脱去睡袍。于是我越过劳勃的身体，就在他的寝室和姐姐做爱——如果国王当时醒转，我会毫不犹豫地宰了他。他不是第一个死在我手下的国王了…你都知道的，不是吗？”他反手一剑，将树枝劈为两半。“我操她的时候，瑟曦说‘我要’。我以为她指的是我，结果却是要废掉那史塔克女孩，不杀也弄个残废。”好好想一想，我为爱情做了些什么。“于是我星夜点兵出发。史塔克的人先找到女孩，算他们走运，如果教我抓住…”">查看中文翻译</div>
