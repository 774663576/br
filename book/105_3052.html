<div class="line_en">Dylan knew the moment they crossed the threshold into the safety of the cabin because the noise stopped instantly. Tristan slammed the door behind him and immediately dropped her to her feet, almost as if having her in his arms had scalded him. Leaving her standing there, her mouth gaping wide in shock, he walked quickly to the window and stared out of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们跨过小屋的门槛后终于安全了，这一刻迪伦记得很清楚，因为那些喧嚣的噪声马上停止了。崔斯坦砰地关上门，手一松让她站了起来，就好像刚才搂着她把他给烫伤了似的。她呆立在那里，害怕地张大了嘴，而他则走到窗边向外望去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pulling her hands away from her face, Dylan examined her arms. Even in the almost-dark, she could see criss-crossed scratches all over her skin. Some had barely grazed her, but others had gouged deeper, causing small droplets of blood to ooze through. Her skin stung all over, burning. Still, the pain hardly registered as the adrenaline that flooded her system made her hands tremble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把手从脸上挪开，检查了一下自己的胳膊。虽然屋里非常昏暗，她仍然可以看到皮肤上那些纵横交错的抓痕。有些只是擦伤，而有些伤口凿进肉里很深，从伤口往外渗着血。她全身的皮肤都火辣辣地痛。然而，肾上腺素在她的身体里奔涌，让她的手不停地颤抖，她几乎察觉不出自己的痛了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cabin, like the cottage the night before, was sparsely furnished. There was a bench along the back wall and Dylan stumbled over to it. She dropped heavily onto the rough wood and hid her head in her hands, small sobs escaping from between her fingers as she tried to control the rush of fear that coursed through her veins, making her heart thump erratically. Tristan glanced over, an unfathomable expression on his face, but he refused to leave his lookout post by the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这间小屋跟昨天晚上的那间一样，也没有什么家具陈设。靠着后墙有一条长凳，迪伦跌跌撞撞地走过去，一屁股坐在粗木凳子上，头埋进双手中。恐惧感飞快地传遍全身的血管，她的心跳时急时缓，她尽力控制着，呜咽的泪滴从指缝间滑落。崔斯坦回身看了她一眼，脸上的表情深不可测，但他仍然没有离开窗边的“瞭望哨”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They stayed like that for a long time -- Tristan statue-like and composed, back at the window; Dylan curled up in a ball on the bench, occasionally crying and gasping quietly, the after-effects of the adrenaline rush. There was no sound from outside. Whatever the things had been, they seemed to have retreated for now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们就这样待了很久。崔斯坦雕塑一般靠窗站着，表情平静。迪伦坐在椅子上蜷缩成一团，偶尔默默流泪，静静地喘息一下，这是刚才肾上腺素泛滥的副作用。外面寂然无声。不管刚才那些东西是什么，它们现在都退走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This cabin also had a fireplace, and after a few minutes Tristan crossed over and bent down to it. There were no logs, and Dylan didn't hear the sound of a match scratching, but there was quickly a fire blazing in the grate. The flickering gave the cottage an eerie atmosphere as shadows played frighteningly against the walls. Dylan didn't question the sudden arrival of the fire, though there was no natural explanation for how it had been lit. There were too many more important, impossible thoughts in her mind, jostling for space. Those ideas niggling at the back of her consciousness were fighting to break through, demanding to be heard. She had so many questions she didn't know where to begin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小屋里也有壁炉。过了几分钟，崔斯坦走过去，在壁炉前弯下腰。没有木柴，迪伦没有听到划火柴的声音，然而很快壁炉里就燃起了一堆火。摇曳的火光中，恐怖的黑影在墙上闪来闪去，给小屋里添了些诡异的氛围。尽管对于火是怎么点着的没有什么合情合理的解释，但迪伦并没有质疑这堆突然而至的炉火。她有太多太多更加重要、更加不可思议的想法。这些念头在她的脑子里纠缠在一起，你争我抢，互不相让。这些念头在她的意识深处寻衅滋事，相互打斗，挣扎着要钻出来，要求得到她的倾听。她的问题太多了，一时反而不知从何说起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually Dylan lifted her head. "Tristan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，迪伦终于抬起了头，“崔斯坦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't look over. He seemed to be bracing himself for something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有看她，似乎还在铆足劲儿准备对付什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tristan, look at me." Dylan waited, and finally he turned his head, slowly and unwillingly. "What was that?" She tried to keep her voice calm, but it was still husky from crying and it cracked a little as she spoke. Her green eyes shimmered as tears still loitered, but she held his stare, willing him to be truthful. Whatever those things had been, Tristan had recognised them. He had been speaking to himself when he'd muttered, "They're here", and he had known what would happen when she let go of his hand. How had he known? What else was he hiding from her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦，看着我。”迪伦等着，终于他慢慢地、不情不愿地回过了头，“那是什么？”她努力让自己的声音平静，然而刚刚哭过，说起话来嗓音依然沙哑，一双碧眼中已然泪水莹莹，但仍然盯着他，希望他能对自己坦诚相待。不管那些东西是什么，崔斯坦认出了它们。他一直在小声嘟囔，自言自语道：“它们就在附近。”当她放开他的手时，他已经知道会发生什么了。他是怎么知道的？他还有什么事情瞒着她？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan sighed. He had known that this point had been coming, but had hoped to postpone it as long as possible. But there were no parlour tricks or games that could gloss over what had happened. Dylan had seen and felt those things. They could not be explained away as wild animals. He had no choice but to be honest with her. He wasn't sure where to start, how to explain in a way she would understand, how to break it to her and yet cause the least amount of pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦叹了口气。他知道这一刻早晚要来临，但仍然希望能拖多久就拖多久。但靠宴会助兴时耍的小把戏是掩饰不过去的。迪伦看到了那些东西，亲身感受到了它们。不可能把它们说成是野生动物搪塞过关。他只能老老实实对待她。他不知道从何谈起，用一种她理解的方式解释这一切，也不知道把实情告诉她，又能不能把她的痛苦减到最小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting close enough to feel her breath on his face, he turned his head and gazed into her green eyes, a luscious, deep green that made him think of forests and nature, and felt a twist in his stomach and a tightening in his chest. He didn't want to hurt her. He wasn't quite sure why, but he felt a yearning need to protect this one, more than he'd ever felt for any of the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们靠得很近，他的脸上能感觉到她的呼吸。他转过头，凝视着那一双碧眼。那绮丽的深绿色让他想起树林和大自然，让他的胃部痉挛，让他的胸口发紧。他不想伤害她。他也不清楚自己为什么会这样，但他有一种想保护这个人的渴望，这种渴望比对其他人的都要强烈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Reluctantly he crossed the room and sat down on the bench beside her. He didn't look at her, but stared at his interlaced fingers, as if hoping to find the answers there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不情不愿地穿过屋子挨着她坐在凳子上。他没有看她，眼睛盯着自己交错的手指，好像希望从那里找到答案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Normally, when revealing the truth became an unavoidable necessity, he just blurted it out. He told himself that a short, sharp shock was better than drawing it out painfully. But in reality, it was because he didn't care. Whether they cried, sobbed, begged or tried to bargain, there was no changing things. He just turned off and waited it out until they accepted the inevitable, and then the two of them could go forward together in mutual understanding. But this time… this time he didn't want to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他躲不过去，不得不把真相如实相告，他从来都会直截了当脱口而出的。他告诉自己，长痛不如短痛。但实际上这样做是因为他根本就不在乎。不管他们是痛哭流涕、呜咽啜泣、苦苦哀求还是跟他讨价还价，一切都无法改变了。他就在那里无声无息，不闻不问，等着他们接受命运的安排。然后两个人就会心有默契地继续走下去。但是这次……这次他不愿意这样做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He paused, gauging her response. He expected to be interrupted by a stream of questions, of demands and accusations, but she just waited, still as stone. Her eyes were pools of fear and uncertainty; she was afraid of what he might say, but determined to hear it nonetheless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他顿了顿，揣摩着她的反应。他以为她会抛出一连串问题，一大堆请求和连声控诉打断自己，但她只是等着，如一块石头一样一动不动。她的眼中满是惊恐和迷茫。她对他可能会说出的话感到害怕，但还是决心听下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You weren't the only one to walk away from the crash, Dylan." His voice had dropped to a whisper, as if he could lessen the blow by turning down the volume. "You were the only one not to."</div>

<div class="line_en">Her eyebrows puckered together in confusion, but she didn't speak and he was glad of that. It seemed easier for Tristan to get the words out without hearing her voice. He refused to do her the disservice of not looking in her eyes, though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她困惑地把眉毛拢成一堆，但没有说话，这让他略感欣慰。听不到她的声音时，崔斯坦似乎更容易把话说出口。不过他不想说话的时候眼睛不看她，从而伤害她的感情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The words were spoken clearly, but they seemed to float in Dylan's brain, refusing to settle into meaning. She tore her eyes away from his in an attempt to process what he was telling her, staring at a broken tile on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话说得很清楚，但是它们似乎只是浮在迪伦的脑海，形成不了任何意义。她把自己的视线强行从崔斯坦身上移开，好像要把他说的话加工一下，只专注地看着地上一块破瓦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry, Dylan," he added, not as an afterthought, but sincerely. Although he didn't understand the reason, he hated inflicting pain on her, wished he could take it back. But there was no undoing what had been done. These things were set in stone. He did not have the power to change them, and it would be wrong to do so even if he could. It was not his place to play God. He watched her blink twice, saw the realisation settle into her being. Any second now the flood of emotion would begin. He hardly dared to breathe, waiting on tenterhooks. He was afraid of her tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很抱歉，迪伦。”他又说了一句。这句话说得很真诚，不是临时想起来后加上去的。虽然他也不知道到底是怎么回事，但自己就是不愿意让她难过伤心。他真想把刚才那番话收回去，但是覆水难收，事情已然无法挽回了。他没有改变这一切的法力，即使他能改变，这样做也是错误的，还轮不到他来充当造物主。他察觉到她的眼睛眨了两下，看着她慢慢明白过来了。现在她随时有可能情绪失控。他几乎不敢呼吸了，提心吊胆地等待着。他害怕她的眼泪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="结果她让他吃了一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，也许在冥冥之中我已经知道了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, that wasn't quite right, Dylan thought. She hadn't known… but somewhere deep down, her subconscious had been keeping tabs on all the things that were wrong, all the things that just didn't add up. Things that were too weird, too strange to be real life. And though she couldn't explain why, she felt no terror at finally acknowledging the truth. Only relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，自己说得还不准确，迪伦想。在这以前她并不知道……但在内心深处某个地方，自己的潜意识一直在密切注意所有不对劲的地方，所有不合乎情理的事情。这些事情太诡异了、太蹊跷了，完全不像是真实的生活。最终承认事实时她觉得没什么可怕的，心里反而如释重负，尽管连她自己也说不清这是为什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded, not trusting himself to speak. Expecting an outpouring of anguish, he lifted his arms out towards her. However, she remained oddly calm. She nodded and sighed, then smiled a tiny smile to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点点头，不敢让自己说话。他预想她会将自己的痛苦统统宣泄出来，于是向她伸出双臂，想给她安慰。然而，她却出奇的冷静。她点点头，轻叹一声，然后淡淡地笑了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought about never seeing Joan or Katie again, of never meeting her father and enjoying the relationship they might have had, of never having a career, a marriage, children. She felt sadness tug at her heartstrings, but overshadowing these mournful thoughts was a sense of inner peace. If it was true, and she knew in her bones that it was, then it was done and unchangeable. She was still here, she was still her, and that was something to be thankful for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想到自己再也见不到琼和凯蒂了，再也不能和父亲见面，享受他们本该有的天伦之乐了，再也不能进入职场、结婚生子了。她感到悲从中来，心情沉重，然而一种内心的宁静感又遮住了忧伤的思绪。如果这一切都是真的，而她也已经预感到了这一点，那么木已成舟，不可更改了。她还在这儿，她还是她，如此已经是万幸了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She pursed her lips and looked unconvinced, but didn't argue the point further. Tristan exhaled a relieved breath. He didn't want to lie to her, but there were some things that he just wasn't allowed to share.</div>

<div class="line_en">"In technical terms, I've never really lived," he replied, a wistfulness in his eyes. Quickly that gave way to a more guarded expression. He had already let slip more than he should. Mercifully, she seemed to read that in his expression, and asked no more questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“严格意义上来说，我从来就没活过。”他回答道，眼中闪过一丝惆怅。然而很快，那一缕忧思就被戒备的表情取代了。他已经吐露了一些自己不该说的话。万幸的是，她似乎从他的表情中明白了这一点，没有再问更多的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How old are you?" Dylan asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你多大了？”迪伦问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a question that he could answer, but didn't want to. He sensed if she knew the truth, if she knew how long he had lingered here -- not learning, growing and experiencing the way a human did, but simply being -- then the delicate connection between them would break. She would see him as old, someone strange and other, and he found that he didn't want that. He attempted to make a joke out of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个问题他能回答，却不想说。他预感如果她知道了真相，如果她知道自己在这里停留了多长时间—不读书，也不长大，没有经历人类的生活，只是这么活着—那他们之间那层微妙的关系也会随即结束。她会把自己当作老人，一个古怪的异类。他发觉自己并不希望那样，于是他决定开个玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How old do I look?" He held out his arms and offered himself up for inspection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得我有多大？”他伸出胳膊，让她检查。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cabin was just one long room, with mismatched furniture suffering the wear and tear of long abandon. Still, it was in better repair than last night's cottage. The doors and windows were still intact and the fire burning strongly in the grate had warmed the room. Besides the bench that Dylan sat on with Tristan, there was an old bed, devoid of blankets but with a mattress. Although it looked like it had seen better days, and was coated with numerous stains, it was inviting at that moment. There was also a kitchen table and sink at the other end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小木屋是一间长长的房间，屋里的家具与它完全不搭，由于长时间无人照管而破损严重。但比起昨晚的小屋，这间屋子的状况还算不错。门窗都完好无损，壁炉里的炉火很旺，屋子里暖洋洋的。在迪伦和崔斯坦坐着的长凳边有一张旧床，上面没有毯子，只是铺着床垫。虽然看起来这张床已经风光不再，上面已然污迹斑斑，但此时此刻它却显得很诱人。屋里的另一头还有一张厨案和水槽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stiffly she stood up -- she must have been sitting on the hard bench for longer than she'd realised -- and crossed the room to the little kitchen area. She felt grimy, uncomfortable. She wanted a wash but the sink looked ancient, like it hadn't been used in years and years. Up close it didn't appear any more optimistic. Both taps were covered in rust. Still, she grasped one and twisted. Nothing happened so she tried the other. When it stuck as well, she increased the pressure, feeling the edges of the tap digging into her palms. She felt something start to give and so squeezed and twisted a little harder, hope burgeoning. With a scrape and a clunk, the top of the tap came away entirely in her hand, the metal weakened by rust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她僵直地站起来—她已经不知不觉地在凳子上坐了许久—穿过屋子走到小厨房的位置。她感觉脏兮兮的很不舒服，她想洗个手，但是水槽看起来很古老，已经有很多年很多年没用了。靠近看也不容乐观，两个水龙头上锈迹斑斑。她抓住一个拧了拧，没有出水，她又试了试另外一个。这个龙头也锈住了，她手上加了劲，感觉龙头尖慢慢戳进掌心。她感觉有东西开始流出来，于是希望复萌，又加了点劲连挤带拧。当啷一声闷响，整个龙头的上部都被掰了下来握在她手中，锈蚀已经让金属脆弱不堪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan nodded, guilt alleviated, and tossed the broken piece into the sink. Then she turned and walked quickly over to the bed. She felt Tristan's eyes on her, and when she twisted round to sit down on the mattress, noticed his gaze was evaluating her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦点点头，负疚感顿时减轻了不少，她把这块破铜烂铁扔进了水槽。她回头快步走到了床边。她感觉崔斯坦正在看自己。她身子一扭，坐在了垫子上，注意到他审视的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What good will crying do?" she asked, with the wisdom of a much older soul. She sighed. "I'm going to try to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哭有什么用呢？”她问，语气中带着一种老道的成年人才有的睿智。她叹了口气，“我要睡觉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" she asked, smiling slightly. Now that the truth was out in the open she felt, oddly, much more comfortable around him. It was as if the secret had been a wedge keeping her in the cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”她微微一笑问道。现在真相已经挑明，可奇怪的是，她反而感觉跟他待在一起自在多了。就好像这个秘密是一根把她挡在门外寒风中的楔子一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan's face was confused, unsure of her meaning, but it made him happy all the same. He watched her sleep for a long time, looking at the shadows of the fire flicker and play across her face, untroubled in unconsciousness. A strange longing to touch her, to stroke down her smooth cheek and brush away the hair that fell over her eyes, came over him, but he didn't move from where he sat. It was simply her youth and vulnerability that was bringing out these feelings in him, he told himself. He was her guide, her temporary protector. Nothing more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦面露疑惑，不清楚她这话是什么意思，但听她这样说他还是很高兴。他久久地看着她酣然入睡，看着摇曳的火光在她脸上晃动。她的脸在无意识中异常平静。他心中突然萌生了一种奇怪的渴望，想要抚摸她，手指顺着她光滑的脸颊慢慢滑下去，帮她把盖在眼上的头发拂到一边。但是他没有从坐的地方站起来。他告诫自己，他之所以产生这样的感觉只是因为她年纪轻轻又娇小柔弱。他是她的向导，她暂时的保护人，除此无他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He couldn't help smiling back at her. "I'm just astonished at your response, that's all. Not one tear." His voice tailed off as her smile fell, and sadness took its place.</div>

<div class="line_en">They didn't speak, but it didn't feel uncomfortable to Dylan. They were content just to be near each other, and words would have ruined the peace of this beautiful place.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were not in the wasteland, but Dylan had the strangest feeling she'd been here before. They were in a forest. It was filled with large oak trees with gnarled trunks and wide, sprawling branches that interwove to create a canopy above them. It was night, but the moonlight filtered down through the trees, dappling gently and casting rippling shadows as the leaves swayed in the breeze. The light wind ruffled her hair, tickling her neck and shoulders. The floor underfoot was a carpet of leaves that rustled as they walked. At some point recently it must have rained, because the air smelled slightly of dampness and nature. Somewhere to her left she could hear the faint trickle of a slow-running stream. It was absolutely exquisite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梦中的他们没有身处荒原，但非常奇怪的是，迪伦却有一种似曾相识的感觉。他们在一片满是高大橡树的树林里，树干粗糙多节，久历风霜，树枝恣肆蔓生，交叠错落，宛如华盖，高举在他们头顶。虽已是夜间，但月光透过树缝漏下来，树叶随风摇摆，树影斑驳，如微波荡漾。清风吹动了她的长发，脖子和肩膀上酥酥麻麻的。他们脚下的路上铺着厚厚一层落叶，有些地方肯定是最近刚下过雨，空气闻起来有淡淡的潮气和大自然的味道。她能听到左手边不知何处潺潺的流水声，简直太细腻婉约了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan dreamed again that night. Although her encounter with the demons had given her ample fodder for a nightmare, they didn't feature. Instead she dreamed of Tristan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，迪伦又做起了梦。尽管遇到群魔可以为一场梦魇提供足够的素材了，但是魔鬼并不是她梦中的主角。她梦到了崔斯坦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the dream, Tristan held her hand as they walked, slowly weaving in and out of the trunks, following no set path but simply choosing a winding route to nowhere. Her skin seemed to burn where his hand touched it, but she was frightened even to twitch her fingers in case he let go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在梦中，崔斯坦牵着她的手，缓步在树木间穿来穿去。他们没有走现成的路，而是选择了一条不知通向何处的蜿蜒小道。她被他的手碰到的地方，皮肤就像火烧火燎一般。但她更害怕他松手，要把她的手指从他的掌心抽出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
