<div class="line_en">"Here's Jim Hawkins!" said Silver. "How friendly of you to visit us, Jim!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来是吉姆·霍金斯！”西尔弗说。“欢迎你来我们这儿，吉姆！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where are my friends?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的朋友们在哪儿？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Silver answered in a smooth voice. "Yesterday. morning, Doctor Livesey came down with a white flag. 'Cap'n Silver,' he said, 'you've lost. The ship's gone.' We looked out and, by thunder, the ship had gone! 'Let's bargain,' said the doctor. So we bargained, and here we are, in the house. And your friends? They walked off and I don't know where they are. And now, are you going to join us, Jim?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西尔弗用流畅的语调开始讲。“昨天早上，李甫西大夫打着白旗来找我们。‘西尔弗船长，’他说，‘你们失败了，船已经开走了！’我们跑出去一看，船果然不见了。‘我们来讲条件吧，’大夫说。我们跟他讲妥了条件，我们就到这里来了。你的朋友？他们走了，我也不知道他们去哪里了。现在你愿意和我们一起干吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're in trouble," I said. "Ship lost, treasure lost, men lost. And if you want to know who did it -- it was me! I was in the apple barrel the night we saw the island, and I heard every word you said. And the ship? It was me who cut her ropes and killed the men aboard her, and it's me who has sailed her to a place where you'll never find her. Kill me if you like, but if you let me live, I'll do what I can to save you when you're arrested and brought to trial for piracy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们的处境很不妙，”我说。“船丢了，财宝丢了，人也丢了。如果你们想知道是谁干的，告诉你们，是我干的。我们看见陆地的那天晚上，我躲在苹果桶里听到你们讲的所有的话。至于那条船，也是我割断了绳索，杀死了船上的人，然后把船驶到你们谁也找不到的地方。要杀要放随你们便，但如果你们放了我，将来你们因为当海盗受审判时，我将尽力救你们的命。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They're going to kill you, Jim," said Silver when the two of us were alone, "and they're going to stop me being their captain. When I looked into that bay and saw the ship was gone, I knew it was all over. Now, I'll save your life, if I can, but it must be a bargain -- you must save Long John from dying under the law."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们要杀掉你，吉姆，”屋里就剩我们两个人时西尔弗说。“他们不想让我当船长了。当我向海湾望去，看见船失踪了，我就知道全完了。现在我要救你，但我们必须讲条件——你也得帮高个儿约翰免上绞架。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not a man answered. I listened to my heart beating. Silver waited calmly, his pipe in his mouth, as he watched his followers. Slowly, they got together at the far end of the house and whispered to each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll tell you what's wrong!" said George. "First, you made too many mistakes on this trip. Second, you let the enemy out of this trap for nothing. And then there's this boy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来告诉你为什么！”乔治说。“第一，在这次航行中你犯了不少错误。第二，你白白从这地方把敌人放走了。还有就是这个孩子的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sea cook looked at what the man had given him. "The black spot!" he said. He turned the paper over. "What's this? No longer captain. You're becoming quite a leading man in this crew, George Merry. You'll be cap'n next, I suppose. But tell me what's wrong."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位海上厨子看了看同伙给他的东西。“黑券！”他说道，然后看纸的背面。“写的什么？下台！你在这伙人中确实是个人物，乔治，我猜接下来一定是你当船长。告诉我为什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I'll answer you," said Silver. "You all know what I wanted but you wouldn't listen, would you? In my plan, we'd be on the Hispaniola now, every dead man alive and the treasure on ship, by thunder! Next, this boy. Well, we'll use him to bargain with. He might be our last chance. And the doctor? You've been glad enough to have a doctor coming to see you every day -- you, John, with your head broken…or you, George, sick and shaking with fever only a few hours ago. I made a bargain, that's why I let'em go!" He threw a piece of paper on to the floor. It was the map with the three crosses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，现在我回答你，”西尔弗说。“你们都知道我想如何行事，但你们都没听，对吗？如果照我说的去做，我们早已回到伊斯帕尼奥拉号上，不会死一个人，船上装满了财宝！还有，这个孩子。现在我们得用他来讲条件。这是我们最后的机会。至于那大夫，约翰，你的头受伤了，你不是曾经很高兴大夫每天来照看你吗？还有你，乔治，几小时前还发烧发抖，病得不行。所以我做了交易，让他们走了！”他把一张纸扔到地上，正是那张画着三个叉叉的地图。">查看中文翻译</div>
