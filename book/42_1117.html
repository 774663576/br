<div class="line_en">He decided he would walk as long as he could, until he was too weak to go any farther, then he'd turn around and go back.</div>

<div class="line_en">He slowed to a walk. As far as he could tell, nobody was chasing him. He could hear voices coming from back by the truck but couldn't make out the words. Occasionally he'd hear the revving of the engine, but the truck wasn't going anywhere anytime soon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的脚步慢下来。渐渐地他不再跑了，视野之内没有人在追他。他能听得到小货车的方向有说话声，但是听不清在说什么。偶尔，他还会听到发动机的轰鸣声，可是小货车一时半会儿哪里也去不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Walking helped calm him down and allowed him to think clearly. He doubted he could make it to Big Thumb, and with no water in his canteen, he didn't want to risk his life on the hope that he'd find refuge there. He'd have to return to camp. He knew that. But he was in no hurry. It would be better to return later, after everyone had a chance to calm down. And as long as he'd come this far, he might as well look for Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="步行让他冷静下来，总算能够理清思绪了。他怀疑自己可能走不到大拇指山，水壶里没有水，他也不想冒着生命危险把希望寄托在他能找到大拇指山上。他必须回到翠湖营。他很清楚这一点。但他并不着急。最好还是晚一点再回去，等所有人都冷静下来。况且，既然已经走了这么远，那还是找找零蛋吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smiled as he realized that wouldn't quite work. He would only go halfway -- halfway as far as he thought he could go, so that he'd still have the strength to return. Then he'd have to make a deal with the Warden, tell her where he found Kate Barlow's lipstick tube, and beg for mercy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当意识到这么做行不通时，他笑了。他只能走到一半——原计划的一半路程，这样才能有足够的力气走回去。到时他还得跟管理员大人做交易，告诉她凯特·巴洛的口红管究竟是从哪里找到的，然后恳求她饶恕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He headed in what he thought was the direction of Big Thumb. He couldn't see it through the haze.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was surprised by how far out the holes extended. He couldn't even see the camp compound anymore, but he still kept passing holes. Just when he thought he'd passed the last hole, he'd come across another cluster of them, a little farther away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他忽然吃惊地看到洞一直延伸到这么远的地方。他已经看不到营地了，可是一个个洞仍在脚边蔓延。每次以为已经走过了最后一个洞时，他都会看到另外一片洞，就在不远处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley found himself looking down into each hole he passed. He didn't admit to himself what he was looking for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利发现自己每经过一个洞，都会往洞里看几眼。他并不认为自己是在找什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stepped over the mounds and looked into the first hole. His heart stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从土堆上跨过去，看了一眼第一个洞。他的心停止了跳动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back at the compound, they had dug in a systematic order, row upon row, allowing space for the water truck. But out here there was no system. It was as if every once in a while, in a fit of frustration, the Warden would just pick a spot at random, and say, "What the hell, dig here." It was like trying to guess the winning numbers in a lottery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="营地附近的洞排列得井然有序，一行接着一行，每两行之间留出足以让送水车通过的距离。可是，这里却杂乱无章。仿佛是每过一阵子，管理员大人就会沮丧地重新指定一片区域，说：“见鬼！就在这里挖。”就跟试着猜彩票头奖号码一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After more than an hour had gone by, he thought he had surely seen the last hole, but then off to the left he saw another cluster of them. He didn't actually see the holes. He saw the mounds of dirt that surrounded them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了一个多钟头，他以为到了最后的洞。然而，在左面不远处，他又发现了一堆洞。实际上，他并没有看到洞，只是发现了堆在四周的土堆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Down at the bottom was a family of yellow-spotted lizards. Their large red eyes looked up at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一大家子黄斑蜥蜴就待在洞里。一双双硕大的红眼睛正向上瞪着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't know if they were chasing after him. He thought he might have seen one leap out of the hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道那群蜥蜴是否也跟了上来。他觉得刚才好像看到其中一只跃了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out to be an empty sack of sunflower seeds. He wondered if it was the same one Magnet had stolen from Mr. Sir, although that didn't seem likely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果，那是只装葵花子的空袋子。他想知道这是不是吸铁石从长官先生那里偷来的那只，但看上去又不完全一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned it inside out and found one seed stuck to the burlap.</div>

<div class="line_en">He sat there awhile and caught his breath. As he got back to his feet, he thought he noticed something on the ground, maybe fifty yards away. It didn't look like much, maybe just a big rock, but in a land of nothingness, any little thing seemed unusual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他坐了一会儿，大口喘着气。等缓过劲站起来时，他觉得看到地上有一样东西，大概在五十码开外。看上去又不太像，大概只是块大石头，在寸草不生的地方，任何无足轻重的东西看上去都会非同寻常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked slowly toward it. The encounter with the lizards had made him very cautious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他缓缓地走过去。在撞上那群蜥蜴之后，他变得格外谨慎。">查看中文翻译</div>
