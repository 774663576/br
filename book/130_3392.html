<div class="line_en">Having covered my back with the authorities, all that was needed to become a going concern again was to regain control of Matthieu, my erstwhile assistant. I knew from letters I had received in England, long rambling disquisitions in which problems of bride-price played a large role, that he was seeking to enter the customs service. This, he had confided, was an assured means of enrichment, but he feared greatly being posted to a remote border area away from other members of his tribe, among "savage bushmen", who would have appalling customs and eat vile food. Were there even Christians in the far north of the country? He was unsure.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is, however, a strange intelligence service that observes such enterprises. As I emerged from the house the next day in the first cold light of dawn, there stood a group of people, luggage heaped at their feet, who knew precisely where I was headed and were resolved to accompany me there, if not farther. One rapidly comes to accept the presence of such a band of companions as inevitable. It would have been an almost uncanny experience -- a sudden hush in a crowded room -- had they not materialized. Refusal was, of course, impossible. We embarked without formality in a furious jostling and shouting. It required great firmness to establish that I must have sufficient space to reach gear-lever and brakes, this space being only grudgingly granted. I announced formally where I was bound. They nodded agreement. Of course. This was understood. Let us leave at once. Bundles of yams, clothes and furious chickens, their feet tied together to make a carrying handle, were adjusted and we set off. The journey was uneventful. There was only one fight caused by the chickens of one woman pecking the child of another. One passenger sought to stop us as we headed for the country so that he could drag forth from concealment a wife and six large bundles of indeterminate material. This ploy was denounced with rage by all the others and so the man abandoned his wife and continued with us alone. Peanuts were passed around and enjoyed with much lip-smacking and joking about their purgative effect on women.</div>

<div class="line_en">I pointed to the rustling mass. "When was that boy cut?" Immediately, there was an explosion of shocked titters, denials that there had been anything in the bush at all. The women averted their eyes or covered their faces with their hands. The jostled chickens screeched. A child wailed. I knew well that -- infuriatingly -- these matters could not be discussed in front of women but it took great self-control to choke back frustrated questions. This, after all, was why I had come all this way. Did it mean that I had missed the ritual by several months, that it was already finished?</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, I saw a sight that made me slam on the brakes and shout with excitement. There, disappearing at speed into the scrub, was a bizarre, bulky figure. At first sight, it was approximately conical and about six feet tall. A tall cone of wickerwork, covered with leaves and creeper, possessed of two arms and feet, it swayed perilously as it rushed into the bush. I knew from descriptions that this was no mirage, monster or friendly English Green Man. It was a boy, circumcised some months previously, and moving around shielded from the gaze of women by this head-to-foot covering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，我看见一个景象，让我紧急踩刹车，兴奋大叫。一个诡异、庞然的身影闪进灌木丛。乍看，它近乎圆锥形，大约六英尺高，是树叶、蔓藤编织而成的巨大圆锥筒，却拥有两只手与两条腿，歪歪倒倒、险状环生地冲进树丛里。从我以往听来的描述，我知道眼前的景象并非幻影，也不是怪物或友善的英国绿巨人（1）。那是个男孩几个月前刚受过割礼，从头到脚覆盖，躲避女人的眼光。【注：（1）English Green Man出自中世纪英国古诗 Gawain and the Green Knigh，Si这首押头韵的诗共有两千五百三十行，共分三大段。第一段描写亚瑟王举行庆典，突然一个手拿冬青树枝、斧头的绿色巨人走进来。他挑战王宫里的武土，说他愿意把自己的头先砍下来，愿意接受挑战的武士，可在一年后才履约把头砍下来。 Gawain接受他的挑战。绿巨人遂把自己的头砍下，手拿着头，大步离开皇宫。一年后，Gawain步上旅途，前去履约，经历许多神奇遭遇。详见 The Oxford Companion to English Literature">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We drove on, myself plunged in gloom until the turn-off that led to Matthieu's village. Was not this the path? I enquired. There came a silent chorus of shaken heads. Surely the man the patron sought was several miles farther on? It would be wise anyway to continue to the Catholic mission that was only another five miles. There, proper enquiries could be made. All these bush villages looked the same. It was not to be expected that I would be able to tell one from another. A chorus of nods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们继续前行，我陷入愁云惨雾，直到驶抵前往马修村子的弯道。我问，是这条路吗？大家一致沉默摇头。您要找的那个人不是还要往前几英里吗？上上策是开往离这儿不过五英里远的天主教会，到那儿再问人。这些丛林村落都长成一个样，我可无法分辨。乘客们又一起点头同意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Matthieu was crouched over his hoe, blade slashing away at the roots of a recalcitrant weed, like some heavily symbolic tableau representing African toil. Gone was the green glossy suit. Sweat coursed down his face -- considerably thinner than when he had been in my employ -- and in his throat rumbled a hoeing song. Dowayos accompany most rhythmic activities with song, turning dull, repetitive work into a sort of dance. His father, a wizened old man of piratical aspect, spotted me first, tapped Matthieu on the shoulder and pointed towards me. Matthieu dropped his hoe and ran -- arms outstretched -- across the field as if in parody of the opening scene of The Sound of Music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马修弯身锄土，刀刃割过顽强的草根，此景看似某种勾勒非洲苦工、象征意义浓厚的画。漂亮的绿色西装不见了。汗珠滚下他的脸庞——看起来，比跟我工作时消瘦多了——嘴里哼唱着多瓦悠犁田歌。多瓦悠人常以歌陪伴节奏性活动，让沉闷重复的工作变得类似舞蹈。马修的父亲是个干缩老头，长相似海盗。他先看到我，拍拍马修的肩膀，指着我。马修丢下锄头、开始奔跑——双臂大张——穿过田野，好像滑稽戏仿电影“真善美”的开场戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们返回马修的新茅屋。多瓦悠人帮我盖新茅屋时，坚持我的茅屋不能和他们一样是圆形的，而是和学校、派出所、监狱一样方形的。白人住圆形茅屋，非常不合规矩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We talked of the news. As ever, Matthieu's world centred on the price of women. His plans to marry a twelve-year-old girl had fallen through because her family had been too demanding. Knowing that Matthieu had worked for me, they had immediately assumed that he must be rich. He looked sorrowfully at me as if in reproach. I groaned inwardly, knowing that the request for a contribution to the bride-price could not be long coming, that I would be unable to provide the huge sum demanded but would end up paying something, leaving me feeling both impoverished and guilty. Finally, we got around to the subject of circumcision. It was always a touchy subject with Matthieu. Being a modern-minded Christian, he had had the operation performed with an anaesthetic at the hospital instead of suffering the rigours of traditional genital mutilation. For this, he would be mocked all his life by other Dowayos who would accuse him of cowardice. He would, moreover, be isolated in many crises of life, not possessing a group of "brothers of circumcision" who had been cut with him and would perform for him the most important ritual duties.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们闲聊近来消息。照例，马修的世界围绕着聘金打转。他原本打算娶个十二岁女孩，计划破灭，因为对方父母要求太多，他们知道马修跟着我工作，认定他也是有钱人。马修哀伤望着我，好似谴责。我内心暗自叹气，知道不久后，马修便会要求我帮衬聘金。而我负担不起这大笔钱，只能帮一点点忙，结局是我既觉内疚又无力。终于，我们谈到割礼。对马修来说，这一直是敏感话题。他是思想现代化的基督徒，因此是到医院、在麻醉的状况下接受割礼，省去传统性器割损仪式的可怕痛苦。也因为如此，他终生要被多瓦悠同胞嘲笑怯懦。此外，人生许多重要仪式，他都会遭到孤离，因为他没有一同接受割礼的“兄弟”为他履行最重要的仪式义务。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back at the road, another group of Dowayos headed for town had mysteriously assembled, including Gaston, from the village where I had lived, his bicycle magnificently garlanded with wrapping paper and plastic flowers. Was this a new bicycle? He looked embarrassed. No, patron. But there was someone at the mission who did have a new bicycle and he had sold the wrapping paper to Gaston to embellish his own machine so that people would think that that was new too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到路上，眼前又神秘聚集一群要前往镇上的多瓦悠人，包括贾世登，他来自我住的那个村子。贾世登的脚踏车用包装纸与塑胶花装饰得缤纷灿烂。这是新脚踏车吗？他面露尴尬。不是的。教会那儿有人买了新脚踏车，把包装纸卖给他装饰车子，好让人们以为他也买了新脚踏车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gaston spoke French so we were able to speak about circumcision -- none of the women understanding the language. Stealing furtive glances around us and conversing in whispers, we discussed the boy I had seen earlier. It seemed there was no need for me to worry. He was not Dowayo. He was Pape from a neighbouring tribe with similar customs. They circumcised at a slightly different time. It was a mystery why he should be so far to the east. Surely no one would feed him round here. It was outrageous that he should wander around here, endangering the fertility of Dowayo women, not that of Pape maids. If he were caught, the men would beat him. Gaston blushed with anger.</div>

He looked at me knowingly, rather after the manner in which drunken Glaswegians are wont to eye those they are about to hit, and approached me making writing motions. In surprisingly good French, he asked politely if I could lend him a pen and paper. The pedagogic urge is a long time dying even in one who has worked in universities. Ballpoint pens are very hard to come by in Dowayoland. They cannot even be bought in town. One is obliged to go some sixty-odd miles to get one. A sure way to cause a near riot is to drop a pen anywhere near a school for it will be pounced on by a hundred eager children. I was, therefore, happy to help the man out. He settled himself at a table and wrote out a long letter with painful slowness, carving each character into the page between great bouts of pen-sucking and rolling of eyes towards the ceiling. The schoolmasters sniggered at the clumsiness of his horny fingers. Meanwhile, I opened negotiations for some beer to take to Zuuldibo.</div>

<div class="line_en">The great problem is bottles. There is a great shortage of bottles, many being abstracted from the system and diverted to purposes quite foreign to those for which they were designed. Dowayos convert them into musical instruments, lamps and hide-scrapers. They use them to contain honey, water and herbal remedies, among other things. There is a vigorous trade in empty bottles. The result is that beer-sellers are reluctant to let fresh bottles out of their grasp unless they receive an equivalent number of empty ones. This doubtless has the worthy effect of preventing a man going to the bad by doubling his beer intake overnight. It works quite well once you have the empty bottles to trade with. Acquiring the first empty bottles is, however, the flaw in the system. It is virtually impossible. I am tempted to recommend that bodies conducting research in former French West Africa should keep a central supply and issue two to each fieldworker. It would enormously improve the efficiency of their workers. This time I was lucky in that I had borrowed two bottles from Jon. My misfortune was that they were not of exactly the same type as those I wished to carry away with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="酒瓶是个大问题。它们严重缺货，许多酒瓶不用来装酒，而是运用在迥异于原先设计的功能上。多瓦悠人将它们改装成乐器、灯座、皮革抹子，或者用来装蜂蜜、水、草药等。空酒瓶的交易炙手可热。结局是除非你拿空的啤酒瓶来买酒，否则酒商不会卖酒给你。此一措施的可贵处在防止酒客堕落、饮酒量激增。如果你手上一开始就有空酒瓶，这套方法的确不错，致命伤是如何搞到第一只空酒瓶。几乎不可能。我强烈建议所有在西非洲前法属殖民地做研究的机构建立空酒瓶中央供应处，发给每个田野集者两只酒瓶。这绝对大大增进研究者的效率。我这次运气不错，和约翰借到两只空酒瓶。不幸，我要买的那种啤酒，酒瓶样子和这两只不同。">查看中文翻译</div>

Others applauded his determination to refer the whole matter to the owner who would surely return before nightfall. The Pape farmer laboured on. Finally, one of the teachers tired of this intellectual flirtation. He would sell me two of his own empty bottles. This bold lateral move was applauded like the winning gambit of a chess-master. It had taken half an hour and cost me half as much again as anyone else, but I managed to buy and carry away two bottles! I prepared to bear them off in triumph.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和许多类似问题一样，多瓦悠人处理此一难题就像买帽子，必须站在镜子前一顶顶试戴；它不是必须尽速解决的进步障碍，而是提供各种有趣论点，有待细细品味。教师们也加入讨论。有些教师指责吧台舍不得新瓶换旧瓶。有的则赞许他坚持此事必须请示酒吧主人，而后者，傍晚时分一定回来。帕皮族农夫继续做苦工。终于，一个教师厌倦了这种“知性挑逗”，决定把他的两只空酒瓶卖给我。另辟蹊径之举赢得如雷掌声，好像大师博弈的开局棋法以牺牲卒子取得优势。整个谈判耗时半钟点，照例，我花了常人的两倍钱，但终于搞到两瓶酒！我准备胜利离去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The letter was written in French, couched in terms appropriate to a high-level ambassadorial exchange of the seventeenth century. It began with the florid phrase, "I address myself, dear Sir, to your high benevolence." In short, which it was not, it was a request for a loan. It appeared that "my brother", the French missionary, had departed for the city and tarried there a day longer than expected. This man, his gardener, had therefore not been paid on time and I should immediately make good his loss, or as the letter put it, "disburse non-receipted money".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那封信以法文书写，措词风格宛如十七世纪高级外交人员的信札往返。它以过于华丽的句子开场：“阁下，在下兹此向宽宏慈善的您启齿……”简言之（其实一点都不简短），这是一封告贷信。根据信上所言，我的“兄弟”一法国传教士—前往城里，比归期多滞留了一天。眼前这个人一他的园丁—一因而未能准时领到薪水，我应当马上赔偿他的损失，或者如信上所言“支付他尚未讫的银两”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ethnography of communication is a matter of some interest to anthropologists, for every culture has rules about what may and may not be said and a way of matching styles to content and context. It was interesting that a loan could not be asked for verbally but only in writing, a fact I had noted before when members of Jon's congregation would hand him similar letters.</div>

<div class="line_en">In West Africa, great stress is laid on verbal felicity. The man who can speak publicly with force and style is likely to rise in society, as is the man who can write elegant or grammatical English or French. The form of this letter had been taken from one of the many books in Africa that offer advice on how to deal with sophisticated correspondence. As in any country where there are many languages, great social mobility and a good deal of demi-literacy, many people are unsure of what is correct or incorrect usage. Books, therefore, often offer whole letters that can be adapted for all occasions by just changing one or two words, rather like the way bad students learn whole essays by heart that they will doggedly apply to the most inappropriate circumstances in an examination. Unfortunately, the people who compile such works in Africa are far from proficient in either language or social sense and can do more harm than good.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the present case, it seemed scant reward for such application and industry simply to refuse an advance.
