<div class="line_en">Sometime later Stanley saw a tarantula crawl across the dirt, not too far from his hole. He had never seen a tarantula before, but there was no doubt what it was. He was momentarily fascinated by it, as its big hairy body moved slowly and steadily along.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Warden had dark circles under her eyes from lack of sleep, and lines across her forehead and face which seemed exaggerated in the stark morning light. Her skin looked blotchy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="管理员大人由于睡眠不足，眼角有两个黑眼圈，额头和脸上的皱纹在明亮的晨光下显得格外清晰。她的皮肤看上去满是斑点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你去拿箱子吧。”长官先生说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他听到汽车开过来的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He heard the cars come to a stop, and the doors open and shut. A little while later he saw Mr. Pendanski and two strangers, coming across the lake. One was a tall man in a business suit and cowboy hat. The other was a short woman holding a briefcase. The woman had to take three steps for every two taken by the man. "Stanley Yelnats?" she called, moving out ahead of the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利听到汽车停了，车门开了又关上。没过多久，他看到潘登斯基先生和两个陌生人从湖那边走过来。其中一个是个大高个，穿着职业装，戴着牛仔帽。另一个是个小个子女士，拎着公文包。那位女士三步并作两步才能赶上那位先生。“斯坦利·叶那茨。”她叫着，快步挤到了最前面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You can't stop me," she snapped, then took a second glance at him, wearing pajama pants and nothing else. "We'll get you out of there, Stanley," she said. "Don't you worry." She appeared to be Hispanic, with straight black hair and dark eyes. She spoke with a little bit of a Mexican accent, trilling her r's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你拦不住我。”她厉声说道，又瞥了一眼这个除了短睡裤什么也没穿的男人。“斯坦利，我们会把你弄出来的，”她说，“别担心。”她看起来像拉丁美洲人，长着一头乌黑的直发和一双黑眼睛，说话时略微有点墨西哥口音，发音时舌头会卷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All night, as you can see by the way we're dressed. They snuck into my cabin while I was asleep, and stole my suitcase. I chased after them, and they ran out here and fell into the lizards' nest. I don't know what they were thinking."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一整夜。瞧瞧我们这身打扮，你能看出来。趁我睡着的时候，他们偷偷溜进我的小木屋，偷走了我的旅行箱。我追他们，他们就跑到这里，结果掉进了蜥蜴窝。真搞不明白他们究竟是怎么想的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
