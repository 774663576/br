<div class="line_en">He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more easily. He kept my hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">His warm hand curled around mine. "'S not so bad," he said, but he wouldn't meet my eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用一只温暖的手握着我的手，“没那么糟糕。”他说，但是他不愿意看着我的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Honestly… most of them do," Jacob admitted slowly. "There are definitely good sides to this -- the speed, the freedom, the strength… the sense of -- of family… Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. So I'm the crybaby now." Jacob laughed at himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老实说……他们大多数人都很喜欢。”雅各布不疾不徐地说道，“这样也有好的一面——速度，自由，力量……还有家一般的——归属感……山姆和我是真正感到很伤心的两个，而且山姆很早以前就经历过这一切了，而我现在则是那个软弱、爱哭的小孩。”雅各布自我解嘲地大笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled and rolled his eyes. "Quil thinks it's the coolest thing that's ever happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what's going on. And he's excited to have his friends back -- to be part of the 'in crowd.'" Jacob snorted again. "Shouldn't be surprised, I guess. It's so Quil."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布歪过头看着我，他微笑起来，转动眼睛说道：“吉尔觉得这是发生在他身上最酷的事情，部分原因在于知道这究竟是怎么回事了，而且朋友们失而复得这令他非常兴奋——成为‘群内’的一分子，”雅各布又哼着鼻子继续说，“不该感到惊讶的，我猜，这才是吉尔啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were so many things I wanted to know. "Why are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam anyway? What's his problem?" The questions tumbled out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed again. "That's a long story."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么多我想知道的事情：“为什么你和山姆不一样呢？在山姆身上到底发生了什么事？他遇到什么问题了？”我一个接一个地抛出这些问题，根本容不得人家来回答，不过雅各布又大笑起来了，“说来话长。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”我承认道，“他很不喜欢我做那些他认为……很冒险的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, right," Jacob muttered. "I'm sure he's quite the pacifist."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“和我说的一样，说来话长，而且非常……奇怪。这种新生活中充满如此多的奇奇怪怪的事情，我给你讲的还不到一半。这件发生在山姆身上的事情——哦，我不知道我能否准确地说明白。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我气愤地盯着地平线，心中满腔怒火。">查看中文翻译</div>

Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he didn't have anyone to tell him what was happening. Sam's grandfather died before he was born, and his father has never been around. There was no one there to recognize the signs. The first time it happened -- the first time he phased -- he thought he'd gone insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough to change back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从眼角我看见他的脸上展开一抹微笑：“山姆所经历的要比我们其他人困难得多。因为他是第一个，而且他是独自一人，没有一个人能听他倾诉发生在他身上的事情。山姆的祖父在他出生之前就已经去世了，而他的父亲从来就没出现过，他身边没有人认出这些迹象。第一次发生这样的事情时——第一次他改变的时候——他以为他发疯了，他花了两个星期的时间平静下来后才变回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Leah?" I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry's daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie's life-long friend, had died of a heart attack this past spring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“里尔？”我问道，心中一惊。里尔是哈里的女儿。听见她的名字，一股同情之情油然而生。哈里？克里尔沃特是查理的至交，在刚过去的这个春天里因为心脏病突发逝世了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn't remember. Sam's mother and Leah Clearwater had the forest rangers searching for him, the police. People thought there had been an accident or something…"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我以为山姆在艾米莉之前不曾爱上其他人，这个想法有些愚蠢。大多数人在一生中会恋爱、失恋很多次。只是因为我看见过山姆和艾米莉在一起的情景，我无法想象他和别人在一起的样子。他看着她的眼神……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sam came back," Jacob said, "but he wouldn't talk to anyone about where he'd been. Rumors flew -- that he was up to no good, mostly.

<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆回来了，”雅各布说，“但是他不愿意跟任何人谈起他去了哪里。流言飞语四起——大多数人都是说他肯定没干什么好事情。接着，一天下午老吉尔？阿提拉——吉尔的祖父来拜访乌利太太，山姆碰巧遇到他。山姆和他握手，老吉尔差点儿没心脏病发作。”雅各布停下来大笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I reached up casually, to take his hand away and free my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I wouldn't hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a surprise I hadn't been expecting, and I had to narrow my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything changed color -- the waves turned from gray to blue, the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳突然从乌云中蹦了出来，这倒是意外的惊喜，水面上波光粼粼，我不得不眯起眼睛。周遭所有的一切都改变了颜色——海浪从灰色变成了蓝色，树木从深橄榄色变成了明亮的碧玉色，彩虹般绚烂的鹅卵石像珠宝一样熠熠生辉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each other under the water's movement, and the cry of gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们斜视了一会儿，调节一下眼睛。这里鸦雀无声，只有海浪发出的低沉的咆哮声在庇护下的海港四周回荡，海水拍打着使石头互相摩擦发出轻柔的碾动的声音，以及海鸥在高空盘旋发出的叫声。这里非常安静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jacob settled closer to me, so that he was leaning against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel the sun heat my skin -- thought it was not quite as warm as Jacob -- and I wondered idly how long it would take me to burn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布坐得离我更近了，他差不多斜靠在我的胳膊上，他是那么温暖。过了一会儿，我抖落身上的风雨夹克，他在喉咙深处发出一丝心满意足的声音，把脸靠在我的头上。我能感觉到太阳晒热了我的皮肤——还以为这不会有雅各布那么温暖——我懒散地想到要过多久我才会燃烧起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

And I remembered how you always used to have your arms wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself together…" Jacob winced, and then shook his head.
