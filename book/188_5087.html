<div class="line_en">There are also men who get "turned" in prison. In the current parlance they "go gay", or "come out of the closet". Mostly (but not always) they play the female, and their favours are competed for fiercely.</div>

<div class="line_en">It comes as no surprise to most these days that there's a lot of buggery going on inside the walls -- except to some of the new fish, maybe, who have the misfortune to be young, slim, good-looking, and unwary -- but homosexuality, like straight sex, comes in a hundred different shapes and forms. There are men who can't stand to be without sex of some kind and turn to another man to keep from going crazy. Usually what follows is an arrangement between two fundamentally "Heterosexual men, although I've sometimes wondered if they are quite as heterosexual as they thought they were going to be when they get back to their wives or their girlfriends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大多数人对监狱中发生鸡奸早已见怪不怪了，或许只有一些新进犯人除外，尤其是那些不幸长得苗条俊秀、又缺乏警觉的年轻犯人。但是同性恋和异性恋一样，也有几百种不同的形式。有的人因为无法忍受无性的生活，因此在狱中转而结交男人，免得自己发疯。通常接下来原本是异性恋的两个男人之间就会有某种安排，虽然我常常怀疑，当他们有朝一日回到妻子和女友身边时，是否真能像自己所说的一样恢复为异性恋者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They are to prison society what the rapist is to the society outside the walls. They're usually long-timers, doing hard bullets for brutal crimes. Their prey is the young, the weak, and the inexperienced… or, as in the case of Andy Dufresne, the weak-looking. Their hunting grounds are the showers, the cramped, tunnel-like area way behind the industrial washers in the laundry, sometimes the infirmary. On more than one occasion rape has occurred in the closet-sized projection booth behind the auditorium. Most often what the sisters take by force they could have had for free, if they wanted it; those who have been turned always seem to have "crushes" on one sister or another, like teenage girls with their Sinatras, Presleys, or Redfords. But for the sisters, the joy has always been in taking it by force… and I guess it always will be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们之于监狱这个小型社会，就好像强暴犯之于墙外的大型社会一样。他们往往是罪大恶极的长期犯，而他们的猎物则是一些年轻、瘦弱和没经验的囚犯……或者，就安迪的情况而言，看起来很柔弱的囚犯。淋浴间、洗衣机后面的狭窄通道，有时候甚至医务室，都成为他们的狩猎场。其中不止一次，强暴案也发生于礼堂后面只有衣橱大小的电影放映室中。很多时候，他们其实不必使用暴力也可以得逞，因为入狱后转为同性恋的囚犯似乎总是会迷上其中一位“姊妹”，就好像十来岁的少女迷恋明星或歌星偶像一样。但是对这些姊妹而言，其中的乐趣正在于使用暴力……而我猜这部分永远都不会改变。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because of his small size and fair good looks (and maybe also because of that very quality of self-possession I had admired), the sisters were after Andy from the day he walked in. If this was some kind of fairy story, I'd tell you that Andy fought the good fight until they left him alone. I wish I could say that, but I can't. Prison is no fairy-tale world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于安迪长得比较矮小，生就一张俊脸，或许也因为他那特有的泰然自若的神态，他一进来就被那批姊妹看上了。如果我说的是童话故事，我会告诉你安迪一直奋勇抵抗，直到他们罢手为止。我很希望能这么说，但我不能。监狱原本就不是童话世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first time for him was in the shower less than three days after he joined our happy Shawshank family. Just a lot of slap and tickle that time, I understand. They like to size you up before they make their real move, like jackals finding out if the prey is as weak and hamstrung as it looks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次出事是在他加入我们肖申克快乐家庭还不到三天的时候，在浴室里。就我所知，那次只是一连串的挑逗和侮辱。那些人喜欢在采取真正的行动前，先捉弄一下猎物，就像胡狼想测试看猎物是否真的像外表那么软弱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Andy punched back and bloodied the lip of a big, hulking sister named Bogs Diamond -- gone these many years since to who knows where. A guard broke it up before it could go any further, but Bogs promised to get him -- and Bogs did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安迪狠狠反击，而且把那个叫博格斯·戴蒙德的大块头嘴唇给打裂了，警卫及时冲进来，才制止住双方进一步的动作，但博格斯发誓非逮到安迪不可，他果然说到做到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second time was behind the washers in the laundry. A lot has gone on in that long, dusty, and narrow space over the years; the guards know about it and just let it be. It's dim and littered with bags of washing and bleaching compound, drums of Hexlite catalyst, as harmless as salt if your hands are dry, murderous as battery acid if they're wet. The guards don't like to go back there. There's no room to manoeuvre, and one of the first things they teach them when they come to work in a place like this is to never let the cons get you in a place where you can't back up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二次则发生在洗衣房后面。多年来，那条狭长肮脏的通道发生了不少事情，警卫全都知道，却放任不管。那里很暗，散置着一袋袋洗衣剂、漂白剂和一桶桶HexliteHexlite为复合材料界巨头——美国赫氏公司（Hexcel）的一个商标。催化剂，如果你的手是干的，碰到也不会怎么样，但是如果弄湿了，这些化学药剂就会像电池的酸液一样害你送命。监狱的警卫都不喜欢来这里，也警诫新人不要到这儿来，因为如果被囚犯困在这个地方，你可没有后退之路，连搏斗的空间都不够。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bogs wasn't there that day, but Henry Backus, who had been washroom foreman down there since 1922, told me that four of his friends were. Andy held them at bay for a while with a scoop of Hexlite, threatening to throw it in their eyes if they came any closer, but he tripped trying to back around one of the big Washex four-pockets. That was ail it took. They were on him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博格斯当时不在场，但从一九二二年起便在洗衣房当工头的亨利·拜克告诉我，博格斯的四个朋友都在那儿。安迪起先手里拿着一碗Hexlite，让他们不敢靠近，他威胁着如果他们再走近一步，就要把催化剂往他们的眼睛丢过去。但是安迪往后退时，不小心跌倒了，结果他们就一拥而上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I guess the phrase gang-rape is one that doesn't change much from one generation to the next. That's what they did to him, those four sisters. They bent him over a gearbox and one of them held a Phillips screwdriver to his temple while they gave him the business. It rips you up some, but not bad -- am I speaking from personal experience, you ask? -- I only wish I weren't. You bleed for a while. If you don't want some clown asking you if you just started your period, you wad up a bunch of toilet paper and keep it down the back of your underwear until it stops. The bleeding really is like a menstrual flow; it keeps up for two, maybe three days, a slow trickle. Then it stops. No harm done, unless they've done something even more unnatural to you. No physical harm done -- but rape is rape, and eventually you have to look at your face in the mirror again and decide what to make of yourself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想“轮暴”这个名词的意义是永远不会改变的，那正是这四姊妹对他做的事。他们把安迪按在齿轮箱上，拿着螺丝起子对准他的太阳穴，逼他就范。被强暴后会有一点伤口，但不是太严重。你问，这是我的经验之谈吗？——但愿并非如此。之后你会流几天血，如果不希望有些无聊小丑问你是不是月经来了，就在裤子里多垫几张卫生纸。通常血流个两、三天就停了，除非他们用更不自然的方式对待你。不过虽然身体没有什么大损伤，强暴终归是强暴，事后你照镜子瞧自己的脸时，会想到日后该怎么看待自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Andy went through that alone, the way he went through everything alone in those days. He must have come to the conclusion that others before him had come to, namely, that there are only two ways to deal with the sisters: fight them and get taken, or just get taken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安迪孤独地经历了这些事情，就像他在那段日子里，孤零零地经历了其他所有事情一样。他一定就像之前许多人那样，得到了这个结论：要对付这群姊妹只有两种方法，要不就是力拼之后不敌，要不就是从一开始就认了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They took him, all three of them. When it was done, Rooster and the other egg -- it might have been Pete Verness, but I'm not completely sure -- forced Andy down to his knees. Bogs Diamond stepped in front of him. He had a pearl-handled razor in those days with the words Diamond Pearl engraved on both sides of the grip. He opened it and said, "I'm gonna open my fly now, mister man, and you're going to swallow what I give you to swallow. And when you done swallowed mine, you're gonna swallow Rooster's. I guess you done broke his nose and I think he ought to have something to pay for it"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们三个人联手制伏他，轮流强暴他，之后再强迫安迪跪下来。博格斯站在他面前，他那时有一把珍珠柄的剃刀，刀柄上刻了“戴蒙德珍珠”的字样。他打开剃刀说：“我现在要解开拉链啦，男人先生，我要你咽下什么东西，你就得给我咽下。等你咽完了我给你的东西，你就得咽下卢斯特的东西，你把他的鼻子打破了，应该要对他有所补偿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He decided to fight When Bogs and two of his buddies came after him a week or so after the laundry incident ("I heard ya got broke in," Bogs said, according to Ernie, who was around at the time), Andy slugged it out with them. He broke the nose of a fellow named Rooster MacBride, a heavy-gutted farmer who was in for beating his stepdaughter to death. Rooster died in here, I'm happy to add.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他决定跟他们力拼。当博格斯和两个同党一星期后尾随安迪时，安迪猛烈还击，当时厄尼刚好在附近。根据厄尼的说法，博格斯当时说：“我听说你已破身了。”安迪打破了一个叫卢斯特的家伙的鼻子，那家伙是个粗壮的农夫，因为打死继女而被关进牢中。我很乐于告诉你，他后来死在这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
