<div class="line_en">At last, by one of those unexpected chances which sometimes happen to people on whom misfortune has exhausted its ingenuity, Dantès was going to reach his goal by a simple, natural means and set foot on his island without arousing any suspicion. Only one night separated him from this long-awaited departure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凡是连年遭祸的人，当长期的灾祸过去以后，有时会遇到意想不到的好运，邓蒂斯现在就是碰上了这种好运，竟可以凭这样简单自然的方法得到他所渴望的机会，可以不会引起任何怀疑而到达那个岛上。现在，离他所朝思暮想的远征，中间只隔一夜了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night was one of the least restful that Dantès had ever spent. In the course of it he ran over every good and bad eventuality in his mind: if he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada's letter written in blazing letters on the wall; if he fell asleep for a moment, the most insane dreams raced around his skull. He was going down into caves paved with emeralds, with walls of ruby and diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop in place of the water that habitually filters through the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一夜是邓蒂斯一生中最心神不宁的一夜，在夜的进程中，各种各样有利的和不利的可能性都在他的脑中骋驰往来。一合上眼，他就看见红衣主教斯巴达的那封遗书用火红的字写在墙上，略一入寐，脑子里就产生了最荒诞古怪的梦境。他走进岩洞里，只见绿玉铺地，红玉筑墙，洞顶闪闪发光，挂满了金刚钻凝成的钟乳石。真珠象凝聚在地下的水气那样一颗一颗的掉下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmond, delighted, wondering, filled his pockets with precious stones, then clambered up into the daylight, only to find them turned into nothing but ordinary rocks. Then he tried to get back into the marvellous caverns which he had only glimpsed, but the path twisted into infinite spirals and the entrance had become invisible. He searched through his tired brain for the mysterious, magic word that had opened the wonderful caves of Ali Baba to the Arab fisherman; but all in vain. The vanished treasure had reverted to the ownership of the genii of the earth, from whom he had momentarily hoped to ravish it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙惊得目眩神迷，把那些光彩四射的宝石装满了几口袋，然后回到洞外，但在天光之下，他那些宝石都变成了平凡的石子。于是他努力想再走进这些神奇的洞窟，但现在道路蜿蜒曲折，化成无数条小径，再也找不到进口了。他鞭策他的记忆力，象阿拉伯渔夫回想那个神秘的魔字以求唤开阿里巴巴的宝窟一样。一切都无用，宝藏已失踪了，他原想从护宝神祇的手上把宝藏偷走，现在宝藏却已回到他们那儿去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Daylight found him almost as feverish as he had been at night, but it also brought logic to assist imagination, and Dantès managed to draw up a plan that had, until now, been only vaguely outlined in his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白天终于来临，而白天几乎也象夜晚那样令人心神不安。但在白天，除了幻想以外，还给人带来了理智。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With evening came the preparations for departure. These preparations gave Dantès an opportunity to hide his anxiety. Bit by bit, he had acquired an authority over his companions that allowed him to give orders as though he were the captain of the vessel; and since his orders were always clear, precise and easy to carry out, the crew obeyed him not only promptly but with pleasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到目前为止，邓蒂斯的脑子里本来还是模糊不清，现在慢慢的想定了一个计划。夜来了，出航的准备都已完成了。这些准备工作使邓蒂斯得以掩饰他的焦急。他已逐渐在他的同伴之中建立起他的威信，简直成了船上的指挥官。又因为他的命令总是很明白，清楚，而且易于执行，所以他的同伴们很乐于服从他，而且执行得很迅速。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At seven o'clock all was ready, and at ten past they rounded the lighthouse, just as it was being lit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上七点钟，一切都准备好了，七点十分，他们已绕过灯塔，塔上那时刚才放光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old seaman let him do as he pleased: he too had recognized Dantès' superiority both to the others and to himself. He saw the young man as his natural successor and regretted that he did not have a daughter so that he might bind Edmond to him in that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老船长并不干涉，因为他也承认邓蒂斯确比全体船员和他自己高明。他觉得这个青年最适宜做他的继承人，很懊恼自己没有一个女儿，以致不能用一个美满的婚姻来笼络爱德蒙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sea was calm, with a fresh wind from the south-east. They were sailing under a clear sky in which God too was progressively putting on His lights, each another world. Dantès announced that everyone could go to bed and that he would take over the helm. When the Maltese -- as they called him -- made such an announcement, that was enough for everyone and they all went easily to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海很平静，他们凭着从东南方吹来的一阵清新的和风在明亮的蓝空下航行，蓝空上，上帝也已燃起他的指路灯，而每一盏灯就是一个世界。邓蒂斯告诉他们大家都可以去休息，他愿独自把舵。马耳他人（因为他们是这样称呼他的）既然说了这句话，这就够了，于是大家就都心满意足地到他们的鸽子笼里去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This sometimes happened: from time to time, Dantès, driven out of solitude into the world, felt an imperative need for solitude. And what solitude is more vast and more poetic than that of a ship sailing alone on the sea, in the darkness of night and the silence of infinity, under the eye of the Lord?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这也是常有的事。邓蒂斯虽为世所弃，但有时却偏偏喜欢孤独，而说到孤独，哪有比驾着一艘帆船，在朦胧的夜里，无边的寂静中，苍天的俯视下，孤零零地漂浮在大海上更完整更富有诗意呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the master woke up, the ship was proceeding under full sail; there was not an inch of canvas that was not swollen by the wind. They were travelling at more than two and a half leagues an hour. The island of Monte Cristo was rising before them on the horizon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmond gazed hungrily on the mass of rocks as they passed through all the colours of sunset, from bright pink to dark blue. From time to time, he flushed warmly, his forehead became congested and a purple haze crossed before his eyes. No gambler whose whole fortune is staked on a single roll of the dice has ever experienced the agony that Edmond did in his paroxysms of hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙非常热切地凝视着那一座山岩，山岩上正呈现着各种各样的暮色，从最浅的粉红到最深的暗蓝无不俱备，而他的两颊也时而泛出红潮，额头时而浮上阴云，他的眼前时而呈现一片薄雾。即使一个以全部身家财产作赌注拚死一博的赌徒，其所经验过的痛苦，也不会象爱德蒙这时徘徊在希望的边缘上所感到的那样剧烈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès ordered the helmsman to turn to port, so that they would leave La Pianosa on their right. He had reckoned that this manoeuvre would shorten the distance by two or three knots.</div>

<div class="line_en">The main thing, in that case, would be to find the lost entrance. There was no point in looking at night, so Dantès put off his search until the next day.

<div class="line_en">The second ship, reassured by the signal which told the late arrival that it was safe to make land, soon appeared, white and silent as a ghost, and dropped anchor, a cable's length from the shore. The transfer of goods began immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那艘帆船还是等在外面，在观察回答的信号究竟对不对，不久，它就静悄悄地驶近来了，只见白朦朦的一片，象是一个幽灵似的，在距岸一箭路以外抛了锚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he worked, Dantès thought of the shout of joy that he could have brought from all these men with a single word if he had spoken aloud the thought that hummed incessantly in his ears and in his heart. But, far from revealing the marvellous secret, he was already afraid he might have said too much or that, by his coming and going, his repeated questions, his minute observations and his constant preoccupation, he might have aroused some suspicion. It was fortunate, at least in these circumstances, that an unhappy past had stamped his features with an indelible air of sadness and that one could perceive only brief flashes of the lights of merriment hovering beneath this cloud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是转运工作开始了。邓蒂斯一面工作，一面想，假如他把心里念念不忘的心思讲出来，则只要讲一个字就可以使所有这些人都高兴得大叫起来，但他丝毫没有泄漏这个宝贵的秘密，他怕自己已经说得太多，由于他喋喋不休地提出问题，东张西望的观察和显然若有所思的那种神态，说不定已引起了人们的怀疑。幸而，在这种状况下，过去的痛苦的遭遇，却帮了他一次忙，惨痛的往事在他的脸上布下了一重无法消除的抑郁，在这一重阴云之下，喜悦的火花即使在融融地燃烧，也只象是昙花一现而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one suspected anything and when, the next day, Dantès took a gun, some shot and powder, and said he would like to go and shoot one or two of the wild goats that could be seen leaping from rock to rock, his expedition was ascribed purely to love of hunting and a desire for solitude. Only Jacopo insisted on following him. Dantès did not want to object, fearing that any reluctance to take a companion with him might awaken suspicion. But they had gone hardly a quarter of a league when, seizing the opportunity to shoot a kid, he told Jacopo to take it back to the crew, suggesting that they should cook it, then signal to him that it was ready for him to share, by firing a shot. Some dry fruit and a flagon of Montepulciano would complete the meal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁都没有产生丝毫怀疑。第二天，当邓蒂斯拿起一支猎枪，带了一点火药和弹丸，准备去打几只在岩石上跳来跳去的野山羊的时候，大家都认为他这个举动只是为了爱好运动或喜欢孤独而已。但是，贾可布却坚持要跟他去，邓蒂斯并不反对，深怕一经反对，就会引起怀疑。他们还没走到一哩路，就已射杀了一只小山羊，于是他请贾可布把它背回到他的伙伴们那儿去，请他们烧起来，烧好以后，鸣枪一声通知他。这只小山羊再凑上一些干果和一瓶普尔西亚诺山的葡萄酒，就是一顿很丰富的酒宴了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In two hours," he said, "these men will leave, richer by fifty piastres, and proceed to risk their lives to gain fifty more. Finally, when they have six hundred livres, they will go and squander this fortune in some town or other, as proud as sultans and as arrogant as nabobs. Today, hope means that I despise their wealth, which seems to me like the most abject poverty; tomorrow, perhaps disappointment may mean that I shall be forced to consider that abject poverty as the height of happiness… Oh! no," he cried, "it cannot be. The wise, the infallible Faria cannot have been mistaken on this one point. In any event, better to die than to go on living this sordid and base existence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在两小时以后，”他说，“这些人就会每人分得五十个毕阿士特出发，冒着生命的危险，再去争取五十块这样的银洋。他们会带着一笔六百里弗的家当回来，然后带着象苏丹那样的骄傲，象印度富豪那样不可一世的气慨，把这笔财富在某一个城市里花得干干净净。现在，希望使我鄙视他们的财富，那笔钱在我看来似乎太不值一笑了。但明天，或许幻想就会被揭破，那时，我将不得不把这种不值一笑的财产当作至高无上的幸福。噢，不！”他喊道，“那是不会的。聪明的法利亚从来不曾算错过一件事，他不会单单在这一件事上弄错的。而且，假如继续过这种卑微可怜的生活，倒还不如死了好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès continued, turning from time to time. Reaching the summit of a rock, he saw his companions a thousand feet below him; Jacopo had just joined them and they were already engaged in preparing a dinner which, thanks to Edmond's skill, now had a main dish. He watched them for a moment with a sad, gentle smile of superiority.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯继续向前走，时时向后回顾，并四面察看。当他爬到一块岩石顶上时，看见他的同伴们已在他的脚下，他已比他们高出一千呎左右。贾可布已和他们在一起，他们正在忙碌地准备，把爱德蒙狩猎的成绩做成一顿好菜。爱德蒙望了他们一会儿，脸上带着一个超群拔俗的人的那种悲哀而柔和的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Dantès, who three months earlier had wanted nothing except freedom, felt already not free enough, but wanted wealth. It was not the fault of Dantès, but of God who, while limiting the power of man, has created in him infinite desires!</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Dantès had approached the place where he supposed the caves to be situated, going along a road hidden between two walls of rock and down a path cut by the torrent, which, in all likelihood, no human foot had ever trodden. Following the line of the shore and examining everything minutely, he thought he could see on certain rocks marks which had been made by human hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Time casts its mossy mantle over physical objects and a mantle of forgetfulness on non-physical ones, and it seemed to have respected these marks, made with some regularity, probably with the aim of tracing a route; but occasionally they disappeared under great bunches of myrtle, heavy with flowers, or under clinging lichens. Edmond would then have to push aside the branches or lift the moss to discover the clues that led him into this new labyrinth. In any case, these marks had given Edmond hope. Why should it not be the cardinal who had made them, so that, in the event of some misfortune which he could not have imagined so absolute, they could serve to guide his nephew? This solitary place seemed designed for a man who wished to hide a treasure. But could these treacherous marks have attracted eyes other than those for which they were intended; had the dark and wonderful island guarded its marvellous secret faithfully?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“时间”给一切有形的物体披上一件外衣，那件外衣就是苔藓，它把一切无形的事物也包裹在一件外衣里，而那件外衣就叫“健忘”，可是它对于这些记号却似乎还相当尊重。这些记号相当有规律，大概是故意留下的，有几处已被盖没在一大丛一大丛四散盛开着的金娘花底下，或寄生科的地衣底下。所以爱德蒙必须拂开花枝或铲除苔藓方能看到在这个迷宫里给他指路的记号。这些痕迹重新燃起了他头脑里的希望。这难道不是红衣主教留下，以备在横祸到来的时候，给他的侄子做路标的吗？但他却没有预料到他的侄子竟会和他同时在飞来横祸下毕命。假如一个人要想埋藏一宗宝藏，显然是喜欢选择这个孤僻的地方的。只是，这些透露消息的记号，除了最初创造它们的人以外，有没有吸引过旁人的眼睛呢？这个荒凉奇妙的小岛是否守住它宝贵的秘密呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Arriving at a point only about sixty yards from the port, but still hidden from his companions by the rocks, Edmond thought that the scratches had come to an end; but they did not lead to any kind of cave. The only point to which they seemed to direct him was a large round rock settled on a solid base. Edmond thought that, instead of having reached the end of the trail, he might, on the contrary, be only at the beginning, so he decided to take the opposite course and retrace his steps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于地面崎岖不平，爱德蒙的同伴们看不到他。当他追踪到离港口六十步的地方时，记号不见了，但记号中止的地方并不见有什么岩洞。只有一块圆形的大石头稳稳地站在那儿，似乎是惟一的目标。爱德蒙想到，或许他所到的地方不是终点而只是一个起点，所以他又折回去，往回追踪自己的脚迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile his companions had been preparing dinner, getting water from the spring, carrying bread and fruit ashore and cooking the kid. Just as they were taking it off its improvised spit, they saw Edmond leaping from rock to rock, as light and daring as a chamois; so they fired a shot as a signal to him. The huntsman immediately changed direction and ran back to them. But, just as they were all watching him as he leapt through the air -- and accusing him of pushing his skill beyond the limits of caution -- as if to justify their fears, Edmond lost his footing. They saw him totter on the peak of a rock, cry out and disappear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这期间，他的同伴们已把饭准备好了，他们从一处泉水那儿弄了一点清水来，摆开干果和面包，于是烤那只羔羊。正当他们把那只香气扑鼻的小兽从铁叉上取下来时，他们看见爱德蒙象一只羚羊那样轻捷而大胆地在岩石上跳来跳去，于是他们按照以前约定的信号，放了一枪。那猎人立刻改变他的方向，迅速地向他们奔来。正当他们注目看望着他那敏捷的跳跃，惊奇于他的大胆时，爱德蒙脚下一滑，他们看到他在一块岩石的边缘上摇摆了一下，不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All of them dashed forward at once, because they were all fond of Edmond, despite his superiority; but it was Jacopo who arrived first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们向他冲过去，虽然爱德蒙比他们高明，他们却都很爱他，而第一个跑到他那儿的是贾可布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, there was no question of him taking food, but he insisted that the others, not having the same reason as he did to fast, should go back to their dinner. For himself, he declared that he only needed a little rest and that they would find him better when they returned. Old sea-dogs do not stand on ceremony: the sailors were hungry and the smell of kid was wafting up to them, so they did not wait to be asked twice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯这时大概不会想到要吃东西，但他一定要他的同伴们去用膳，他们没有理由要象他一样绝食。至于他自己，他说他只要休息一会儿，当他们回来的时候，他大概可以好一点了。水手们不用三推四请，他们实在饿了，烤山羊的味道又非常的香，而且水手们本来也是并不十分讲究礼貌的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He found Edmond lying on the ground, covered in blood and almost unconscious: he must have tumbled from a height of twelve to fifteen feet. They put a few drops of rum in his mouth, and this medicine, which had already proved so effective with him, had the same result the second time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发觉爱德蒙直挺挺地躺在那儿，身上流血，几乎已失去了知觉。他是从十二呎或十五呎高的地方滚下来的。他们倒了几滴甜酒在他的喉咙里，而这服药，以前曾对他这样有效，这次也产生了和以前同样的效果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmond re-opened his eyes, complained of a sharp pain in the knee, a great weight on his head and an unbearable stabbing in the small of the back. They tried to carry him to the beach, but when they touched him, even though Jacopo was directing operations, he groaned and said that he did not feel strong enough to be moved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他张开眼睛，诉说膝头非常痛，头觉得很重，腰也痛得厉害。他们想把他扛到海滨去，虽然在贾可布的指挥之下，可是当他们一碰到他，他就啊唷啊唷地呻吟，说他动不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Dantès announced that he would rather die where he was than suffer the terrible pain that he felt at the slightest movement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯说他情愿死在那儿，也不愿意受最轻微的搬动而引起的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then," said the master, "whatever happens, it will not be said that we left a good comrade like yourself without help. We'll delay our departure until this evening."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”船长说，“那末只好听天由命了，我们不能让人说闲话，说我们丢弃了象你这样的一个好伙伴。我们等到晚上再走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the pain, instead of lessening, actually seemed to have increased. The old master, who was obliged to leave that morning so that he could put off his cargo on the frontier of France and Piedmont, between Nice and Fréjus, insisted that Dantès try to get up. Dantès made a superhuman effort to comply, but every time fell back, pale and groaning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，邓蒂斯的痛苦非但没有减轻，而且似乎更厉害了。老船长为了要把那批货运到皮埃蒙特和法国边境，在尼斯和弗雷儒斯之间卸货上岸，所以不得不在早晨开船。他催促邓蒂斯站起来试试看，爱德蒙费了很大的劲想服从，但他每一用力就倒了回去，口里不住的呻吟，脸色转成青白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later they returned. All that Edmond had managed to do was to drag himself about ten yards so that he was leaning against the mossy rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一小时以后，他们回来了。爱德蒙力所能及的，只是把自己向前拖了十几步，靠在一块长满苔藓的岩石上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This suggestion astonished the sailors, though none of them opposed it; on the contrary. The master was a man of such rigid ideas that this was the first time they had seen him give up a project, or even delay it. But Dantès did not want such a serious breach of the ship's rules to be made on his behalf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话使水手们大为惊奇，虽然谁都不反对。船长纪律极严，他们从来没有看见他放弃过一笔交易或迟延过一次既定的程序，这次算是破题儿第一遭。邓蒂斯不允许为了他而做出这种破坏常例的举动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"His back is broken," the master whispered. "No matter, he's a good comrade and we can't abandon him. Let's try to carry him to the tartan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他跌断肋骨了，”船长低声说，“没有关系，他是一个好人，我们绝对不能丢掉他。我们设法来把他抬到船上去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What can we do, Maltese?" he said. "We cannot abandon you here, but we can't stay, either."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们怎么办呢，马耳他人？”船长问。“我们不能让你这样留在这儿，可是我们又不能再等下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will starve," said the master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你会饿死的呀。”船长说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no," he told the master. "I was clumsy and it is right that I should suffer for my own carelessness. Leave me a small supply of biscuits, a gun, powder and shot to kill goats -- or even to defend myself -- and a pickaxe so that I can build some kind of house, in case you are too long in returning to fetch me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，”他对船长说。“我太笨了，这是我行动笨拙应得的惩罚。给我留下一点饼干，一支枪，一点火药和子弹，这样我就可以打些小山羊或在需要的时候保护我自己，再留下一把鹤嘴锄，要是你们回来得迟，我可以给自己造一间小茅屋。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Better that," Edmond answered, "than to suffer the unspeakable pain that I feel at the slightest movement."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我情愿饿死，”爱德蒙回答，“不愿受搬动，即使最轻微的搬动也会引起说不出的痛苦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We'll be gone for at least a week, and even then we shall have to turn off course to pick you up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们至少要离开一个星期，”船长说，“然后我们又要特地弯到这儿来接你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The master turned to look at the ship, swaying at anchor in the little harbour with its sails partly set, ready to head out to sea as soon as the rest of its canvas had been raised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船长转过去看看他的帆船，帆船正停泊在小港口里，一部分帆已扯了起来，差不多一上去就可以出海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Listen," said Dantès, "if, two or three days from now, you meet some fishing boat or other that is sailing near here, let them know about me and I shall pay them twenty-five piastres to take me back to Leghorn. If you don't pass any such vessel, then come back yourselves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“何必呢，”邓蒂斯说，“要是两三天内你们碰到什么渔船，叫他们到这儿来接我好了。我愿意付二十五个毕阿士特，算是带我回里窝那的船费。要是碰不到，你们在回来的时候再来接我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The master shook his head. "Listen, Monsieur Baldi," Jacopo told the master, "there's a way to settle all this. You leave and I'll stay with the patient and take care of him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船长摇摇头。“这末吧，波尔狄船长，这件事有一个办法可以解决，”贾可布说。“你们去，我留在这儿看顾他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Would you give up your share in the bounty," Edmond said, "to stay with me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你放弃这次冒险的那份红利来陪我吗？”爱德蒙说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Willingly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“心甘情愿。”贾可布说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A strange smile passed over Dantès' face and he shook Jacopo's hand warmly; but he was unshaken in his resolve to remain, and to remain alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的嘴角上飘过一个奇妙的微笑。他亲热地紧紧的抓住贾可布的手。但什么都不能动摇他的决心，他要留下来，——而且独自留下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are a fine lad, Jacopo," said Edmond. "God will reward you for your goodwill. But I don't need anyone, thank you. In a day or two I shall be rested, and I expect to find some excellent herbs in these rocks which will cure my wounds."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是一个好人，是一个好心肠的伙伴，”爱德蒙答道，“你这样慷慨，上天会报偿你的，但是我不愿意任何人来陪我。我只要休息一两天就会好的，我希望能在岩石缝里找到一种最妙的跌伤草药。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The smugglers left Edmond what he wanted and walked off, looking back several times and warmly waving goodbye; Edmond replied with only one hand, as though he could not move the rest of his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些走私贩子只得给了他所要求的那些东西，然后和他分别，但仍好几次回过头来，每次回头都做出恋恋不舍的表示。爱德蒙只是挥手作答，象是他身体的其余那些部分都已不能动了似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this, he cautiously dragged himself to the top of a rock that lay between him and the sea, and from there he could see the tartan completing its preparations, raising anchor, hovering elegantly like a seagull about to take flight, and setting sail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他小心地把自己拖到一块可以俯视海面的岩石顶上，从那个地方，他看到那艘独桅船完成了一切出航的准备，拉起锚，象一只振翅待飞的水鸟似的文雅地摆了一摆它的身体，扯上帆走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, when they had gone, he muttered, with a laugh: "It's strange that one should find such proof of affection and acts of devotion among men of that kind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，当他们都走得不见了的时候，他微笑着说，“真奇怪，想不到在这种人里边我们倒找到了友爱的证明。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Dantès got up, lighter and more supple than one of the goats that prance around among the gum-trees and myrtle bushes on these savage rocks, took his gun in one hand and his pick in the other and ran to the rock which represented the end of the trail of notches that he had followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，邓蒂斯一跃而起，简直比生长在这座荒山的金娘花和灌木丛中的小山羊更矫捷轻快，一手握枪，一手拿了鹤嘴锄，急急忙忙向记号尽头的那块岩石走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later, it had completely disappeared: at least, from the place where the wounded man was lying, it had vanished from sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一小时以后，它完全走出视线以外，至少是，那受伤的人从他所在的地方不能再看到它。">查看中文翻译</div>
