<div class="line_en">When Jill woke next morning and found herself in a cave, she thought for one horrid moment that she was back in the Underworld. But when she noticed that she was lying on a bed of heather with a furry mantle over her, and saw a cheery fire crackling (as if newly lit) on a stone hearth and, farther off, morning sunlight coming in through the cave's mouth, she remembered all the happy truth. They had had a delightful supper, all crowded into that cave, in spite of being so sleepy before it was properly over. She had a vague impression of Dwarfs crowding round the fire with frying-pans rather bigger than themselves, and the hissing, and delicious smell of sausages, and more, and more, and more sausages. And not wretched sausages half full of bread and soya bean either, but real meaty, spicy ones, fat and piping hot and burst and just the tiniest bit burnt. And great mugs of frothy chocolate, and roast potatoes and roast chestnuts, and baked apples with raisins stuck in where the cores had been, and then ices just to freshen you up after all the hot things.</div>

You've got to be off in a few minutes and two Centaurs have very kindly offered to let you ride on their backs down to Cair Paravel." He added in a lower voice. "Of course, you realize it is a most special and unheard-of honour to be allowed to ride a Centaur. I don't know that I ever heard of anyone doing it before. It wouldn't do to keep them waiting."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's gone down to meet the King, his father, at Cair Paravel," answered the Faun, whose name was Orruns. "His Majesty's ship is expected in harbour any moment.

<div class="line_en">"Why, Son of Adam, don't you understand? A Centaur has a man-stomach and a horse-stomach. And of course both want breakfast. So first of all he has porridge and pavenders and kidneys and bacon and omelette and cold ham and toast and marmalade and coffee and beer. And after that he attends to the horse part of himself by grazing for an hour or so and finishing up with a hot mash, some oats, and a bag of sugar. That's why it's such a serious thing to ask a Centaur to stay for the week-end. A very serious thing indeed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么，亚当的儿子，难道你不明白？一匹人头马有一个人的胃和一个马的胃。当然两个胃都要填上早餐。因此它先吃点粥和帕文德鱼、腰子、熏肉、煎蛋卷、冷火腿、烤面包片、果酱、咖啡和啤酒。吃过后再照顾自己身上马的那一部分，吃上一个多小时的青草，临了再来点热面糊，一点燕麦和一袋糖。这就是为什么说邀请人头马来度周末是件大事。的确是件天大的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not much chance of that, I should say," replied Puddleglum. "1 don't reckon I'm very likely to see my old wigwam again either. And that Prince -- he's a nice chap -- but do you think he's very strong? Constitution ruined with living underground, I shouldn't wonder. Looks the sort that might go off any day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我得说，这种机会不多，”普德格伦说，“我想我很可能再也见不到自己的旧棚屋了。还有那个王子——他是个好人——但你们认为他很强壮吗？地下生活把他的身子骨毁了，这我不奇怪。看来他随时都会送命的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment there was a sound of horse-hoofs tapping on rock from the mouth of the cave, and the children looked up. The two Centaurs, one with a black and one with a golden beard flowing over their magnificent bare chests, stood waiting for them, bending their heads a little so as to look into the cave. Then the children became very polite and finished their breakfast very quickly. No one thinks a Centaur funny when he sees it. They are solemn, majestic people, full of ancient wisdom which they learn from the stars, not easily made either merry or angry; but their anger is terrible as a tidal wave when it comes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时山洞口传达了马蹄叩击石头的声音，两个孩子抬头望去。两匹人头马，一匹是黑胡子，一匹是金黄色胡子，胡子飘拂在它们健壮的光胸脯上，正站着等他们。人头马还把头低下来，往山洞里看。于是两个孩子变得很有礼貌，快快地吃完了早餐。看见人头马时谁也不会觉得它可笑。人头马是庄重而威严的动物，一肚子古代学问，那是跟星星学来的，它们轻易不流露喜怒，但它们发起火来就像海啸一样可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Puddleglum!" said Jill. "You're a regular old humbug. You sound as doleful as a funeral and I believe you're perfectly happy. And you talk as if you were afraid of everything, when you're really as brave as -- as a lion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“普德格伦！’，吉尔说，“你真是个一成不变的鬼话大王。听上去你口气伤心得像在出席葬礼，而我相信你心里十分快活。你说话像是样样事都害怕，其实你勇敢得就像一头狮子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, speaking of funerals," began Puddleglum, but Jill, who heard the Centaurs tapping with their hoofs behind her, surprised him very much by flinging her arms round his thin neck and kissing his muddy-looking face, while Eustace wrung his hand. Then they both rushed away to the Centaurs, and the Marsh-wiggle, sinking back on his bed, remarked to himself, "Well, I wouldn't have dreamt of her doing that. Even though I am a good-looking chap."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，说起葬礼……”普德格伦开始说，但吉尔听见人头马在她后面一个劲儿顿蹄子，就出其不意伸出双臂搂住它的细脖子，亲亲它那泥土色的脸，尤斯塔斯也趁此和它紧紧握手。接着他们都奔向人头马去了，沼泽怪倒在床上，自言自语道：“啊，即使我是个漂亮的家伙，我做梦也没想到她会来这一手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To ride on a Centaur is, no doubt, a great honour (and except Jill and Eustace there is probably no one alive in the world today who has had it) but it is very uncomfortable. For no one who valued his life would suggest putting a saddle on a Centaur, and riding bare-back is no fun; especially if, like Eustace, you have never learned to ride at all. The Centaurs were very polite in a grave, gracious, grown-up kind of way, and as they cantered through the Narnian woods they spoke, without turning their heads, telling the children about the properties of herbs and roots, the influences of the planets, the nine names of Aslan with their meanings, and things of that sort. But however sore and jolted the two humans were, they would now give anything to have that journey over again: to see those glades and slopes sparkling with last night's snow, to be met by rabbits and squirrels and birds that wished you good morning, to breathe again the air of Narnia and hear the voices of the Narnian trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骑上一匹人头马，虽然无疑是一份极大的光荣（除了吉尔和尤斯塔斯，今天在世的人大概没一个有过这份光荣），不过骑在上面十分不舒服。因为爱惜自己生命的人没一个会提出在人头马身上放个马鞍子，而骑光背马可不是闹着玩的，尤其是像尤斯塔斯那种根本没学过骑马的人。人头马非常有礼貌，可以说又庄重又高雅，一副成年人的态度，它们慢慢跑过纳尼亚的树林时，头也不回就说开了，告诉两个孩子草药和根茎的性质、行星的影响、阿斯兰九个名字的意思，等等等等。但不管这两个人当时一路上多颠多痛，如今他们却愿意不惜一切代价再来一趟：看看那些林间空地和山坡在隔夜雪后闪闪发亮，遇上一些兔子、松鼠和鸟儿向你道早安，再呼吸一下纳尼亚的空气，再听听纳尼亚树木的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They came down to the river, flowing bright and blue in winter sunshine, far below the last bridge (which is at the snug, red-roofed little town of Beruna) and were ferried across in a flat barge by the ferryman; or rather, by the ferry-wiggle, for it is Marsh-wiggles who do most of the watery and fishy kinds of work in Narnia. And when they had crossed they rode along the south bank of the river and presently came to Cair Paravel itself. And at the very moment of their arrival they saw that same bright ship which they had seen when they first set foot in Narnia, gliding up the river like a huge bird. All the court were once more assembled on the green between the castle and the quay to welcome King Caspian home again. Rilian, who had changed his black clothes and was now dressed in a scarlet cloak over silver mail, stood close to the water's edge, bare-headed, to receive his father; and the Dwarf Trumpkin sat beside him in his little donkey-chair. The children saw there would be no chance of reaching the Prince through all that crowd, and, anyway, they now felt rather shy. So they asked the Centaurs if they might go on sitting on their backs a little longer and thus see everything over the heads of the courtiers. And the Centaurs said they might.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill expected to see the old King come down it. But there appeared to be some hitch. A Lord with a pale face came ashore and knelt to the Prince and to Trumpkin. The three were talking with their heads close together for a few minutes, but no one could hear what they said. The music played on, but you could feel that everyone was becoming uneasy. Then four Knights, carrying something and going very slowly, appeared on deck. When they started to come down the gangway you could see what they were carrying: it was the old King on a bed, very pale and still. They set him down. The Prince knelt beside him and embraced him. They could see King Caspian raising his hand to bless his son. And everyone cheered, but it was a half-hearted cheer, for they all felt that something was going wrong. Then suddenly the King's head fell back upon his pillows, the musicians stopped and there was a dead silence. The Prince, kneeling by the King's bed, laid down his head upon it and wept.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were whisperings and goings to and fro. Then Jill noticed that all who wore hats, bonnets, helmets, or hoods were taking them off -- Eustace included. Then she heard a rustling and flapping noise up above the castle; when she looked she saw that the great banner with the golden Lion on it was being brought down to half-mast. And after that, slowly, mercilessly, with wailing strings and disconsolate blowing of horns, the music began again: this time, a tune to break your heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have come," said a deep voice behind them. They turned and saw the Lion himself, so bright and real and strong that everything else began at once to look pale and shadowy compared with him. And in less time than it takes to breathe Jill forgot about the dead King of Narnia and remembered only how she had made Eustace fall over the cliff, and how she had helped to muff nearly all the signs, and about all the snappings and quarrellings. And she wanted to say "I'm sorry" but she could not speak. Then the Lion drew them towards him with his eyes, and bent down and touched their pale faces with his tongue, and said:</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. I have come to bring you Home," said Aslan. Then he opened his mouth wide and blew. But this time they had no sense of flying through the air: instead, it seemed that they remained still, and the wild breath of Aslan blew away the ship and the dead King and the castle and the snow and the winter sky. For all these things floated off into the air like wreaths of smoke, and suddenly they were standing in a great brightness of mid-summer sunshine, on smooth turf, among mighty trees, and beside a fair, fresh stream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，我就是来带你们回家的，”阿斯兰说。接着他又张大了嘴，吹啊吹。不过这一次他们可不觉得自己在空中飞；相反，他们似乎留在原地不动，阿斯兰那口猛烈的气吹走了那艘船、死去的国王、城堡以及雪和冬日的天空。这一切都像一团团烟圈那样在空中飘走了，突然间，他们站在一大片明亮的仲夏阳光下，站在柔滑的草地上，周围有好多大树，旁边是一条清澈的小溪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they saw that they were once more on the Mountain of Aslan, high up above and beyond the end of that world in which Narnia lies. But the strange thing was that the funeral music for King Caspian still went on, though no one could tell where it came from. They were walking beside the stream and the Lion went before them: and he became so beautiful, and the music so despairing, that Jill did not know which of them it was that filled her eyes with tears.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Aslan stopped, and the children looked into the stream. And there, on the golden gravel of the bed of the stream, lay King Caspian, dead, with the water flowing over him like liquid glass. His long white beard swayed in it like water-weed. And all three stood and wept. Even the Lion wept: great Lion-tears, each tear more precious than the Earth would be if it was a single solid diamond. And Jill noticed that Eustace looked neither like a child crying, nor like a boy crying and wanting to hide it, but like a grownup crying. At least, that is the nearest she could get to it; but really, as she said, people don't seem to have any particular ages on that mountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来阿斯兰停下了，两个孩子看看那条小溪。在小溪底层的金色碎石上，躺着死去的凯斯宾国王，溪水像透明的玻璃般流过他身上。他那把长长的白胡子在水中像水草一样摇摇摆摆。他们三个都站在那儿哭了。连狮王也哭了，伟大的狮王的眼泪，每颗泪珠如果是一颗纯净钻石的话，那比尘世间什么都珍贵。吉尔注意到尤斯塔斯既不像一个小孩儿哭，也不像一个男孩子哭时要躲躲闪闪，而是像个大人似的哭着。至少这点是她认为最接近事实的看法。不过实际上，正像她说过的一样，在那座山上人们似乎没有什么具体年龄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And it splashed into the stream over the dead body of the King. At the same moment the doleful music stopped. And the dead King began to be changed. His white beard turned to grey, and from grey to yellow, and got shorter and vanished altogether; and his sunken cheeks grew round and fresh, and the wrinkles were smoothed, and his eyes opened, and his eyes and lips both laughed, and suddenly he leaped up and stood before them -- a very young man, or a boy. (But Jill couldn't say which, because of people having no particular ages in Aslan's country. Even in this world, of course, it is the stupidest children who are most childish and the stupidest grown-ups who are most grownup.)
