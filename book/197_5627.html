<div class="line_en">Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从哈利放暑假回家，弗农姨父一直把他当一颗定时炸弹看待，因为哈利不是一个正常的孩子。实际上，他相当不正常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry Potter was a wizard -- a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利波特是一个巫师——刚在霍格沃茨魔法学校上完一年级。如果德思礼对他回家过暑假感到不快，那么他们的不快和哈利的感觉相比根本不值一提。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他真想念霍格沃茨，想得五脏六腑都发痛。他想念那个城堡，那些秘密通道和幽灵鬼怪，想念他的课程（也许除了魔药老师斯内普的课），还有猫头鹰捎来的信件、大礼堂里的宴会，想念他宿舍楼里的四柱床，想念禁林边上那间小木屋和狩猎场看守海格，更想念魁地奇球——魔法世界里最流行的体育运动（六根高高的门柱、四只会飞的球、十四名骑着扫帚的球员）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利刚一到家，弗农姨父就把他的咒语书、魔杖、长袍、坩埚和最高级的光轮2000锁进了楼梯下那又小又暗的柜子里。哈利会不会因为一个暑假没练习而被学院魁地奇球队开除，德思礼一家才不管呢。哈利的家庭作业一点都没做，回学校时无法交差，这跟他们有什么关系？德思礼一家是巫师们所说的“麻瓜”（血管里没有一滴巫师的血液）。在他们看来，家里有一个巫师是莫大的耻辱。弗农姨父甚至把哈利的猫头鹰海德薇也锁在了它的笼子里，不让它给魔法世界的任何人送信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利跟这家人长得一点儿也不像。弗农姨父膀大粳圆，没有脖子，蓄着异常浓密的大胡子；佩妮姨妈长了一张马脸，骨节粗大；达力头发金黄，皮肤白里透红，体形肥胖。而哈利却身材瘦小，长着一双明亮的绿眼睛，漆黑的头发总是乱蓬蓬的，额头上还有一道细长的闪电形伤疤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys'doorstep eleven years before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就是这道伤疤使哈利即使在巫师中也是如此与众不同。这道伤疤是哈利神秘过去留下的惟一痕迹，是推测他十一年前为什么会被放在德思礼家门槛上的惟一线索。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow -- nobody understood why -- Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利一岁时，居然在遭到伏地魔诅咒之后幸存下来。伏地魔是有史以来最厉害的黑巫师，大多数女巫和男巫都不敢提到他的名字。哈利的父母就死在这个黑巫师手下，可是哈利大难不死，只留下了这道闪电形伤疤。而且，不知怎的，好像自那个恶毒的咒语在哈利身上失灵之后，伏地魔的魔力就被摧毁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys'story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，哈利是由他的姨妈和姨父养大的。他在德思礼家住了十年，一直搞不懂他为什么能在无意中导致一些古怪的事情发生，因为德思礼一家只说他的父母死于车祸，他的伤疤也是在车祸中留下的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous… but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年前，霍格沃茨魔法学校写信给哈利，他才了解到自己的身世。他上了魔法学校，在那里他和他的伤疤赫赫有名…可现在学年结束了，他回到德思礼家过暑假，他们把他当成一条在邋遢地方打过滚的狗来对待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake -- but to ignore it completely…</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talking of nothing else for two weeks.

<div class="line_en">No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有贺卡，没有礼物，今晚还要他假装自己不存在。他悲伤地注视着树篱。他从未感到这样孤独。他分外想念他最好的朋友罗恩韦斯莱和赫敏格兰杰，胜过想念霍格沃茨其他的一切，甚至包括魁地奇球。可他们好像一点儿也不想他。整个暑假谁都没有给他写信，罗恩还说要请哈利去他家做客呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal -- and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一次又一次，哈利差点儿要用魔法打开海德薇的笼子，让它捎封信给罗恩和赫敏。但这太冒险了。未成年的巫师是不能在校外使用魔法的。哈利没有把这个规定告诉德思礼一家，他知道，这家人只是害怕他把他们全变成金龟子，才没有把他和魔杖、飞天扫帚一起关进楼梯下的暗柜里。回家后的头两个星期，哈利喜欢假装着嘴里念念有词，然后看达力拼命搬动他那两条胖腿，尽快往屋外跑。可是罗恩和赫敏迟迟不给他来信，使哈利觉得自己和魔法世界断了联系，连捉弄达力也失去了乐趣——现在罗恩和赫敏连他的生日都忘了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes --</div>
