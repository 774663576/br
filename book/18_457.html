<div class="line_en">The other mother was waiting for her, standing on the grass with her arms folded. Her black-button eyes were expressionless, but her lips were pressed tightly together in a cold fury.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she saw Coraline she reached out one long white hand, and she crooked a finger. Coraline walked towards her. The other mother said nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, the world had become a formless, swirling mist with no shapes or shadows behind it, while the house itself seemed to have twisted and stretched. It appeared to Coraline that it was crouching and staring down at her, as if it were not really a house but only the idea of a house -- and the person who had had the idea, she was certain, was not a good person. There was sticky web-stuff clinging to her arm, and she wiped it off as best she could. The grey windows of the house slanted at strange angles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面，世界成了一片没有形状的迷雾。雾里什么都没有，没有东西，连影子都没有。回头一看，连宅子本身都拧歪了，拉长了。卡萝兰觉得，这幢宅子好像低低蹲伏下来，瞪着她。宅子已经不是宅子了，只是宅子的概念。卡萝兰看得出来，脑袋里装着这么吓人的概念的人，准不是个好人。一扇扇灰色窗户斜着，角度很怪。她的胳膊上还沾着蜘蛛网似的东西，她尽量擦擦干净。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Coraline," said the other mother coldly, and her voice did not just come from her mouth. It came from the mist, and the fog, and the house, and the sky. She said, "You know that I love you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，卡萝兰。”另一个妈妈冷冷地说。声音不是从她嘴里发出的，声音来自那片雾，来自那幢宅子，来自天空。她说，“你知道，我是很爱你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And, despite herself, Coraline nodded. It was true: the other mother loved her. But she loved Coraline as a miser loves money, or a dragon loves its gold. In the other mother's button eyes, Coraline knew that she was a possession, nothing more. A tolerated pet, whose behaviour was no longer amusing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰虽然不情愿，还是点了点头。这是真的：另一个妈妈确实爱她。可那种爱不是妈妈对女儿的爱。是守财奴爱钱那种爱，或者龙爱金子那种爱。看着那双纽扣眼睛，卡萝兰知道，另一个妈妈只把她当成自个儿的一件东西。一只宠物。但现在，这只宠物有点不招人喜欢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”卡萝兰想了想，说，“有钥匙吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said the other mother. "But if you wanted to get into the flat in the front -- the empty one -- to look around, you would find the door locked, and then where would you be?"</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no furniture in there, only places where furniture had once been. Nothing decorated the walls; there were discoloured rectangles on the walls to show where paintings or photographs had once hung. It was so silent that Coraline imagined that she could hear the motes of dust drifting through the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有家具，只有从前家具留下的印子。墙上也没有装饰，只有一块块长方形的印迹，说明以前挂过画或者照片。房间里安静极了，卡萝兰觉得自己能听到灰尘在空中飘动的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First she walked through the empty kitchen. Then she walked through an empty bathroom, containing only a cast-iron bath, and, in the bath, a dead spider the size of a small cat. The last room she looked at had, she supposed, once been a bedroom; she could imagine that the rectangular dust-shadow on the floorboards had once been a bed. Then she saw something, and smiled, grimly. Set into the floorboards was a large metal ring. Coraline knelt and took the cold ring in her hands, and she tugged upward, as hard as she could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她先是穿过空荡荡的厨房，然后走进空空的浴室，里面只有一个铸铁浴缸，浴缸里还有一只小猫那么大的死蜘蛛。她搜查的最后一个房间过去是卧室。这是她猜的，觉得地板上那一大片长方形从前肯定是一张床。最后，她发现了一件东西，笑了。地板上嵌着一个大铁环。卡萝兰跪下来，双手抓住铁环，使出吃奶的力气向上拉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Terribly slowly, stiffly, heavily, a hinged square of floor lifted: it was a trapdoor. It lifted, and through the opening Coraline could see only darkness. She reached down, and her hand found a cold switch. She flicked it without much hope that it would work, but somewhere below her a bulb lit, and a thin yellow light came up from the hole in the floor. She could see steps, heading down, but nothing else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一块沉甸甸的翻板慢慢抬起来，慢得让人恼火。这是个暗门。从打开的暗门望下去，下面黑洞洞的，什么都看不见。她伸手下去，摸到一个凉凉的开关。她轻轻一拨开关，心里并没有抱什么希望。可出乎她的意料，下面亮起一盏灯，洞口射出微弱的黄色灯光。她看见了一段向下的梯子，但除了梯子以外，其他还是什么都看不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Up through the hole in the floor came the smell of damp clay, and something else, an acrid tang like sour vinegar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞里一股湿泥巴味儿。还有点别的，酸酸的，像放坏的醋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline put her hand into her pocket and took out the stone with the hole in it. She looked through it at the cellar but saw nothing. She put the stone back into her pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰掏出那块带洞眼的石块，透过洞眼向下看。没什么发现。她把石头放回衣兜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline let herself down into the hole, looking nervously at the trapdoor. It was so heavy that if it fell she was sure she would be trapped down in the darkness for ever. She put up a hand and touched it, but it stayed in position. And then she turned towards the darkness below, and she walked down the steps. Set into the wall at the bottom of the steps was another light switch, metal and rusting. She pushed it until it clicked down, and a naked bulb hanging from a wire from the low ceiling came on. It did not give out enough light even for Coraline to make out the things that had been painted on to the flaking cellar walls. The paintings seemed crude. There were eyes, she could see that, and things that might have been grapes. And other things, below them. Coraline could not be sure that they were paintings of people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰开始向下走，又回过头，紧张地看了看那扇暗门。它太沉了，如果扣下来，她肯定会永远关在这下头。她伸手晃了晃门，门纹风不动。卡萝兰这才转过身，一级级踏着梯子，朝黑洞洞的下面走。梯子最下面旁边的墙上还有一个开关，是金属做的，已经生锈了。她用力拨下开关。亮了。原来，低矮的天花板上有～根电线，电线下面悬着一个没有灯罩的灯泡。灯光昏暗，卡萝兰辨不清这个地窖墙壁上的画，只觉得画得很粗糙。她看得出上面画着眼睛，还有一些像葡萄的东西。葡萄下面还有其他东西。卡萝兰心想，不知这些画是不是人画的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In that dim light, it took her several seconds to recognise it for what it was: the thing was pale and swollen, like a grub, with thin, stick-like arms and feet. It had almost no features on its face, which had puffed and swollen like risen bread dough. The thing had two large black buttons where its eyes should have been.</div>

She was already tiptoeing, as quietly as she could, up the steps that would take her away from the dim cellar with the crude paintings on the walls.

Then, as if it was being told what to do, the creature stopped moving, and its blind head tipped to one side. It's listening for me, thought Coraline. I must be extra quiet.

<div class="line_en">Coraline turned and ran wildly up the last half-dozen steps, and she pushed herself up and on to the floor of the dusty bedroom. Without pausing, she pulled the heavy trapdoor towards her, and let go of it. It crashed down with a thump just as something large banged against it. The trapdoor shook and rattled in the floor, but it stayed where it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰转过身，撒腿就跑，以最快速度冲上最后几级梯子。她蹦进那间满是灰尘的卧室，没有半点停顿，翻下那扇沉甸甸的暗门。砰的一声，门重重砸下去。下面一阵猛撞，撞得暗门轰轰直响，摇摇晃晃，发出嘎嘎的响声。可它到底还是没被撞开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked out of that flat as fast as she could, without actually ever running, and she locked the front door behind her. She left the door-key under the mat. Then she walked down on to the drive.</div>

<div class="line_en">She hugged herself, and told herself that she was brave, and she almost believed herself, and then she walked around to the side of the house, in the grey mist that wasn't a mist, and she made for the stairs, to go up.</div>
