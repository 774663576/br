<div class="line_en">The Christmas moon was showing her cold face to the low hills called the Marlbury Downs, in the southwestern part of England known as Mid-Wessex. Here sheep were kept out on the hills all year round, and lambs were born as early as December. Shepherds needed to be on the hills day and night at this time of year, and often used small wheeled huts where they could rest and keep warm, while keeping a careful eye on the sheep.</div>

<div class="line_en">On a high piece of land one of these huts stood inside a little circle of trees, which kept it out of the icy wind and also hidden from any passers-by. The hut was made of wood, and had a door and two windows. The north one looked out on the eight hundred sheep which were in the shepherd's care, and the south window gave a view of three ancient stones, built in the shape of a doorway. These great stones, which village people called the Devil's Door, had been there for over two thousand years. They were worn and weather-beaten, but tonight looked almost new in the silver light of the moon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一片高地之上，有一间小屋掩映在一小圈树木中，由此既免受了刺骨寒风的侵袭，又躲避了过路人的视线。小屋用木头制成，有一扇门和两扇窗户。从北面的窗户望出去可以看到牧羊人看管的八百头羊，从南面的窗户望出去则是堆成门形的三块古老的石头。这些巨石被村民们称为“魔鬼之门”，已经在那里矗立了两千多年。它们斑驳残破、饱经风霜，但今夜在银色的月光照耀下，却宛若新生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The sheep should be all right until the morning now," said the shepherd, "but one of us must stay here, so I'll leave ye, do ye hear? I'll go home and sleep for a few hours. Run down to my cottage and fetch me if anything happens. Ye can have a bit of a sleep in the chair by the stove but only for a few minutes, mind! Make sure ye stay awake the rest of the time, and don't let that fire go out!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“羊群在天亮前应该没事了，”牧羊人说，“不过我们当中必须有人留在这儿，所以我得让你留下，你听到了吗？我要回家睡几个小时。如果发生了什么事，就跑下山到我家去找我。你可以在火炉旁的椅子上睡一小会儿，不过就几分钟，记住！别的时间你都得醒着。还有，别让火熄了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old man closed the door, and disappeared. The boy went out to check on the sheep and new-born lambs, then came back into the hut and sat down by the warm stove. Soon his eyes closed, his head dropped, and he was asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he woke up, he could hear down in the valley the clock at Shakeforest Towers striking eleven. The sound carried well in the cold night air. He looked out of the north window and saw the sheep, lying on the grass as quietly as before. He next looked out of the opposite window, towards the stones of the Devil's Door, white and ghostly in the moonlight. And in front of them stood a man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="醒来时，他听见山谷里舍克弗洛斯特城堡的钟敲了11下。钟声在清冷的夜空中传得很远。他从北面的窗户望出去，看到羊群依然安静地卧在草地上。接着，他朝相反方向的窗户望出去，看到“魔鬼之门”的石头惨白而诡异地矗立在月光中。石门前站着一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was clear that he was not a farm worker, because he was wearing a dark suit, and carried himself like a gentleman. The boy was still wondering, in great surprise, why the man was visiting the Devil's Door at this hour, when suddenly another figure appeared. This second figure was a woman, and when the stranger saw her, he hurried towards her. He met her near the trees, and took her into his arms.</div>

<div class="line_en">But only for a moment. Suddenly, a third figure appeared, from behind the stones. He was a man of heavier build than the Captain, and was wearing riding boots. It was clear that he had watched the meeting between the Captain and the Duchess. He had been too far away to hear their conversation and the lady's reluctant words, so to him they had the appearance of lovers. But several more years passed before the boy was old enough to understand this.</div>
