<div class="line_en">Carrie pondered over this situation as consistently as Hurstwood, once she got the facts adjusted in her mind. It took several days for her to fully realise that the approach of the dissolution of her husband's business meant commonplace struggle and privation. Her mind went back to her early venture in Chicago, the Hansons and their flat, and her heart revolted. That was terrible! Everything about poverty was terrible. She wished she knew a way out. Her recent experiences with the Vances had wholly unfitted her to view her own state with complacence. The glamour of the high life of the city had, in the few experiences afforded her by the former, seized her completely. She had been taught how to dress and where to go without having ample means to do either. Now, these things -- ever-present realities as they were -- filled her eyes and mind. The more circumscribed became her state, the more entrancing seemed this other. And now poverty threatened to seize her entirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heaven to which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the last three months of the Warren Street connection, Hurstwood took parts of days off and hunted, tracking the business advertisements. It was a more or less depressing business, wholly because of the thought that he must soon get something or he would begin to live on the few hundred dollars he was saving, and then he would have nothing to invest -- he would have to hire out as a clerk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在沃伦街酒店干的最后三个月里，赫斯渥抽出部分时间，按着那些商业广告，四下寻找机会。这事多少有些令人伤感，原因完全在于他想到他必须马上找到事情做，否则他就得开始靠他攒的那几百块钱过活，那样他就会没钱投资，他就不得不受雇于他人，做个职员了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, too, the ideal brought into her life by Ames remained. He had gone, but here was his word that riches were not everything; that there was a great deal more in the world than she knew; that the stage was good, and the literature she read poor. He was a strong man and clean -- how much stronger and better than Hurstwood and Drouet she only half formulated to herself, but the difference was painful. It was something to which she voluntarily closed her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同样也留下了艾姆斯带进她生活的理想。他的人走了，但他的话还在：财富不是一切；世界上还有很多她不知道的事；当演员不错；她读的文学作品不怎么样。他是个强者，而且纯洁——究竟比赫斯渥和杜洛埃强多少、好多少，她也只是一知半解，但是期间的差别令她痛苦。这是她有意不去正视的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything he discovered in his line advertised as an opportunity, was either too expensive or too wretched for him. Besides, winter was coming, the papers were announcing hardships, and there was a general feeling of hard times in the air, or, at least, he thought so. In his worry, other people's worries became apparent. No item about a firm failing, a family starving, or a man dying upon the streets, supposedly of starvation, but arrested his eye as he scanned the morning papers. Once the "World" came out with a flaring announcement about "80,000 people out of employment in New York this winter," which struck as a knife at his heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在广告中发现的每一家看来能提供机会的酒店对他都不合适，要么太贵，要么太糟。另外，冬天即将来临，报纸在告诉人们困难时期到了，人们普遍感到时世艰难，或者至少他是这么认为的。他自己在犯愁，因此别人的忧愁也变得显而易见了。他在浏览早报时，什么商店倒闭，家庭挨饿，路人据猜因为饥饿而倒毙街头，没有一则这类的消息能逃过他的眼睛。一次，《世界报》刊出了一条耸人听闻的消息说：“今冬纽约有八万人失业。”这则新闻就像一把刀子，刺痛了他的心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Curiously, as he troubled over his future, his thoughts occasionally reverted to his wife and family. He had avoided such thoughts for the first three years as much as possible. He hated her, and he could get along without her. Let her go. He would do well enough. Now, however, when he was not doing well enough, he began to wonder what she was doing, how his children were getting along. He could see them living as nicely as ever, occupying the comfortable house and using his property.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说来奇怪，当他为自己的前途犯愁的时候，他偶尔会转念想起他的太太和家庭来。头三年中，他尽量避而不想这些。他恨她，没她他也能过活，让她去吧。他能过得挺好。可是现在，当他过得不太好时，他却开始想起她，不知她在做些什么，他的孩子们过得怎样。他能想象得出，他们照旧过得很好，住着那幢舒适的房子，用着他的财产。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“八万人，”他想。“这事多么可怕呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was new reasoning for Hurstwood. In the old days the world had seemed to be getting along well enough. He had been wont to see similar things in the "Daily News," in Chicago, but they did not hold his attention. Now, these things were like grey clouds hovering along the horizon of a clear day. They threatened to cover and obscure his life with chilly greyness. He tried to shake them off, to forget and brace up. Sometimes he said to himself, mentally: "What's the use worrying? I'm not out yet. I've got six weeks more. Even if worst comes to worst, I've got enough to live on for six months."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种想法对于赫斯渥是全新的。从前，人们似乎都过得挺好。在芝加哥时，他曾常常在《每日新闻》上看到类似的事情，但是没有引起过他的注意。如今，这些事情就像是晴朗的天边铺着的阴云，威胁着要将他的生活笼罩和遮蔽在阴冷灰暗之中。他想甩开它们，忘记它们，振作起来。有时候，他心里自言自语：“犯愁有什么用呢？我还没完蛋嘛。我还有六个星期的时间。即便出现最糟的情况，我还有足够的钱过上六个月。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, five weeks before the Warren Street place closed up, he left the saloon to visit three or four places he saw advertised in the "Herald." One was down in Gold Street, and he visited that, but did not enter. It was such a cheap looking place he felt that he could not abide it. Another was on the Bowery, which he knew contained many showy resorts. It was near Grand Street, and turned out to be very handsomely fitted up. He talked around about investments for fully three-quarters of an hour with the proprietor, who maintained that his health was poor, and that was the reason he wished a partner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在关闭沃伦街酒店前五个星期的一天下午，他离开酒店去拜访他在《先驱报》上看见登有广告的三四个地方。一个在金街，他去看了，但没进去。这地方看上去太寒酸了，他觉得无法忍受。另一个在波威里街上，他知道这条街上有很多豪华的酒店。这家酒店靠近格蓝德街，果然装修得非常漂亮。他转弯抹角地和店东兜着圈子谈论投资问题，整整谈了有3刻钟。店东强调说，他身体不好，因此想找个合伙人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he looked back now and analysed the situation which led up to his taking the money, he began mildly to justify himself. What had he done -- what in the world -- that should bar him out this way and heap such difficulties upon him? It seemed only yesterday to him since he was comfortable and well-to-do. But now it was all wrested from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，当他回首往事，分析导致他偷那笔钱的情形时，他开始适度地替自己辩护。他干了什么，究竟干了什么，要把他这样排挤出去，要把这么多的困难堆在他的头上？对他来说，仿佛就在昨天，他还过得舒适、宽裕。可是现在，他却被剥夺了这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

It got so that they talked even less than usual, and yet it was not Hurstwood who felt any objection to Carrie. It was Carrie who shied away from him. This he noticed. It aroused an objection to her becoming indifferent to him. He made the possibility of friendly intercourse almost a giant task, and then noticed with discontent that Carrie added to it by her manner and made it more impossible.</div>

<div class="line_en">For some days thereafter he put on his overcoat regularly in the morning and sallied forth. On these ventures he first consoled himself with the thought that with the seven hundred dollars he had he could still make some advantageous arrangement. He thought about going to some brewery, which, as he knew, frequently controlled saloons which they leased, and get them to help him. Then he remembered that he would have to pay out several hundred any way for fixtures and that he would have nothing left for his monthly expenses. It was costing him nearly eighty dollars a month to live.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, he started out. His clothes were very good and his appearance still excellent, but it involved the trouble of deluding. People, looking at him, imagined instantly that a man of his age, stout and well dressed, must be well off. He appeared a comfortable owner of something, a man from whom the common run of mortals could well expect gratuities. Being now forty-three years of age, and comfortably built, walking was not easy. He had not been used to exercise for many years. His legs tired, his shoulders ached, and his feet pained him at the close of the day, even when he took street cars in almost every direction. The mere getting up and down, if long continued, produced this result.</div>

<div class="line_en">This getting-something proposition complicated itself the moment he began to think of what it was he wanted to do. Manage a place? Where should he get such a position?

<div class="line_en">The fact that people took him to be better off than he was, he well understood. It was so painfully clear to him that it retarded his search.

Taking a chair here was a painful thing to him. To think he should come to this! He had heard loungers about hotels called chairwarmers. He had called them that himself in his day.

A long, bright column told of the doings in the theatrical world -- the plays produced, the actors appearing, the managers making announcements. Fannie Davenport was just opening at the Fifth Avenue. Daly was producing "King Lear." He read of the early departure for the season of a party composed of the Vanderbilts and their friends for Florida.
