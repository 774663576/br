<div class="line_en">She would wake up swimming in her bed, screaming, and drowning in the flood of sheets. On the other side of the room, the bed that was meant for her brother floated boatlike in the darkness. Slowly, with the arrival of consciousness, it sank, seemingly into the floor.

<div class="line_en">Some days Papa told her to get back into bed and wait a minute, and he would return with his accordion and play for her. Liesel would sit up and hum, her cold toes clenched with excitement. No one had ever given her music before. She would grin herself stupid, watching the lines drawing themselves down his face and the soft metal of his eyes -- until the swearing arrived from the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些日子里，爸爸让她回到床上等一小会儿，他把手风琴拿过来为她演奏。莉泽尔坐在床上跟着旋律哼唱，她冰冷的脚趾会激动地蜷起来。过去从来没有人为她演奏过音乐。她傻傻地笑着，看着皱纹在他的脸上、他温柔而坚毅的眼睛下方蔓延开来，直到厨房里传来咒骂声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hans Hubermann sat sleepy-eyed on the bed and Liesel would cry into his sleeves and breathe him in. Every morning, just after two o'clock, she fell asleep again to the smell of him. It was a mixture of dead cigarettes, decades of paint, and human skin. At first, she sucked it all in, then breathed it, until she drifted back down. Each morning, he was a few feet away from her, crumpled, almost halved, in the chair. He never used the other bed. Liesel would climb out and cautiously kiss his cheek and he would wake up and smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管睡眼惺忪，汉斯·胡伯曼还是会坐在莉泽尔的床头，任她哭湿他的衣袖，呼吸着他身上的气味。每天凌晨两点之后，她伴着他的气味再度入眠，那其中混合着熄灭的香烟的味道、数十年的油漆味和皮肤的气味。她将它们吸入，然后呼出，接着仰头倒下。当清晨来临的时候，他总是睡在离她几米远的地方，在椅子上蜷成一团，只有平时的一半高。他从来没有睡过另一张床。莉泽尔爬下床，小心翼翼地亲亲他的脸颊，他就微笑着醒来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Papa's bread and jam would be half eaten on his plate, curled into the shape of bite marks, and the music would look Liesel in the face. I know it sounds strange, but that's how it felt to her. Papa's right hand strolled the tooth-colored keys. His left hit the buttons. (She especially loved to see him hit the silver, sparkled button -- the C major.) The accordion's scratched yet shiny black exterior came back and forth as his arms squeezed the dusty bellows, making it suck in the air and throw it back out. In the kitchen on those mornings, Papa made the accordion live. I guess it makes sense, when you really think about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸吃了一半的面包和果酱都扔在盘子里，面包上还留着牙印，而音乐仿佛就在莉泽尔眼前。我知道这样的表述非常奇怪，但这是她的真实感受。爸爸的右手在乳白色的琴键上游走，左手则按着键钮。（她尤其喜欢看他按那个银光闪闪的C大调键。）手风琴的黑色外壳上虽然有几处刮伤，但依旧光可鉴人，风箱随着手臂的挤压和拉伸吸入空气又吐出来。在这样的清晨，爸爸让手风琴活了过来。如果仔细想想，你应当能想象出那幅场景。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound of the accordion was, in fact, also the announcement of safety. Daylight. During the day, it was impossible to dream of her brother. She would miss him and frequently cry in the tiny washroom as quietly as possible, but she was still glad to be awake. On her first night with the Hubermanns, she had hidden her last link to him -- The Grave Digger's Handbook -- under her mattress, and occasionally she would pull it out and hold it. Staring at the letters on the cover and touching the print inside, she had no idea what any of it was saying. The point is, it didn't really matter what that book was about. It was what it meant that was more important.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，手风琴的音乐声也是安全的宣告，宣告白昼已经来临。白天的时候，她不可能梦见弟弟。尽管她仍旧思念他，也常常躲在狭小的盥洗室里不出声地哭泣，但她依旧庆幸自己能醒来。在来到胡伯曼家的第一个夜晚，她就把自己和弟弟最后的联系——那本《掘墓人手册》藏到了床垫底下，时不时将它拿出来捧在手里，注视着封面上的字母，抚摸着书里的文字，尽管她并不知道这本书里写了什么。其实这本书讲什么都不要紧，重要的是它对她的意义。">查看中文翻译</div>

Looking at the bag of washing and the hunched houses, she would talk, and talk, and talk. "If your papa was any good," she informed Liesel every time they walked through Molching, "I wouldn't have to do this." She sniffed with derision. "A painter! Why marry that Arschloch? That's what they told me -- my family, that is." Their footsteps crunched along the path. "And here I am, walking the streets and slaving in my kitchen because that Saukerl never has any work. No real work, anyway. Just that pathetic accordion in those dirt holes every night."</div>
