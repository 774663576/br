<div class="line_en">I could not go to him -- I could not make my feet respond; they were bolted to the stone beneath them. But I scrutinized his every action minutely, looking for any evidence that he had been harmed. My heart slowed to a healthier rhythm when I found nothing. He was lithe and graceful as ever. I couldn't even see a tear in his clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能走到他身边——我无法让我的脚做出反应；它们都牢牢地拴在了石头上，但是我一丝不苟地审视着他的每个动作，寻找他受到伤害的痕迹。我什么也没发现，心跳才慢了下来，达到健康的节奏。他和以前一样敏捷、优雅，我甚至没在他衣服上看见破洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He did not look at me -- where I stood frozen to the cliff wall, horrified -- while he piled the quivering, twitching limbs and then covered them with dry pine needles. He still did not meet my shocked gaze as he darted into the forest after Seth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有看我——我呆呆地站在崖壁上，惊恐万状——他则把颤抖抽搐的四肢堆起来，然后用干枯的松针把它们掩埋起来。他一个箭步跑到森林里找塞思的时候，还是没有正视我惊慌失措的眼神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward was in motion again. Swift and coolly businesslike, he dismembered the headless corpse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华又动了起来。他动作敏捷，神情冷静，有条不紊地把那具没有头的尸体肢解了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't have time to recover before both he and Seth were back, Edward with his arms full of Riley. Seth was carrying a large chunk -- the torso -- in his mouth. They added their burden to the pile, and Edward pulled a silver rectangle from his pocket. He flipped open the butane lighter and held the flame to the dry tinder. It caught at once; long tongues of orange fire licked rapidly across the pyre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还没有时间恢复过来，他们俩就都回来了，爱德华抱着一堆赖利的碎片。塞思的嘴巴里衔了一大块——躯干。他们把带回来的东西堆在那堆上面，爱德华从口袋里掏出一个银色的长方形。他砰地打开液体打火机，把火焰靠近干枯易燃的松针。火一下子就点燃了，长长的橘红色火舌迅速地吞噬了这堆火葬燃料。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not understand his expression. His eyes were as wary as if I were another enemy -- more than wary, they were afraid. Yet he'd shown no fear at all when he'd faced Victoria and Riley… My mind was stuck, stunned and useless as my body. I stared at him, bewildered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不懂他的表情。他的眼睛很警觉就好像我是另外一个敌人一样——那不仅仅是警觉，是害怕。然而，当他面对维多利亚和赖利的时候没表现出丝毫的恐惧……我的思想堵住了，和我的身体一样惊呆了，毫无用处了，我迷惑不解地凝视着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nice teamwork," Edward murmured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“合作得很漂亮。”爱德华低声说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward stretched out his arm, his hand curled into a fist. Seth grinned, revealing the long row of dagger teeth, and bumped his nose against Edward's hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华伸出胳膊，手握成了拳头。塞思笑了笑，露出一长排像匕首一样的利齿，用鼻子撞击爱德华的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get every piece," Edward said in a low aside to Seth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把每一片都找来了。”爱德华轻声地对塞思说了句旁白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Together, the vampire and the werewolf scoured the campsite, occasionally tossing small lumps of white stone into the blaze. Seth handled the pieces with his teeth. My brain wasn't working well enough for me to understand why he didn't change back to a form with hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一起，吸血鬼和狼人一起搜索了整个宿营地，偶尔把一小片白色的石头扔进火堆里，塞思用牙齿咬住碎片。我的大脑运转的不够好，我想不明白为什么他不变回有手的外形。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then they were done, and the raging fire was sending a pillar of choking purple toward the sky. The thick smoke curled up slowly, looking more solid than it should; it smelled like burning incense, and the scent was uncomfortable. It was heavy, too strong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他们都做完了，熊熊燃烧的火焰飘到空中．形成一根紫色烟柱，散发出令人窒息的气味。浓烟滚滚，慢慢往上爬，看起来坚固得超过了本该有的程度；闻起来就像燃烧的香一样，气味让人觉得不舒服。烟很浓，太呛了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bella, love," he said in his softest tone, walking toward me with exaggerated slowness, his hands held up, palms forward. Dazed as I was, it reminded me oddly of a suspect approaching a policeman, showing that he wasn't armed…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉，爱，”他用最温柔的声音说道，朝我走过来的时候速度慢得有些夸张，他举起手臂，手掌向前。如我这般茫然，这让我古怪地想起一个嫌疑犯正慢慢地靠近警察，证明他没有武器……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bella, can you drop the rock, please? Carefully. Don't hurt yourself."</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward hesitated a few feet from me, his hands still in the air, his eyes still fearful.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took me a few long seconds to remember how to move my fingers. Then the rock clattered to the ground, while my hand stayed frozen in the same position.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我过了好一会儿才想起来怎样移动我的手指头。接着石头吧嗒一声落在地上，我的手僵硬地停留在原处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd forgotten all about my crude weapon, though I realized now that I was grasping it so hard that my knuckle was screaming in protest. Was it rebroken? Carlisle would put me in a cast for sure this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经完全忘记我粗糙的武器了，尽管我现在意识到我正抓住它，握得那么紧，使我的关节一直在尖叫着抗议。它会不会又骨折了？卡莱尔这一次肯定会给我上夹板了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我手中空无一物之后爱德华稍稍放松了一些，但是他还是没向我靠近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's going to be all right, Bella. I know you're frightened now, but it's over. No one is going to hurt you. I won't touch you. I won't hurt you," he said again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“会没事的，贝拉。我知道你现在很害怕，但是已经结束了。没有人会伤害你了，我不会碰你的，我不会伤害你的。”他又说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mystifying promise only confused me further. I stared at him like an imbecile, trying to understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">I clung to him until I could breathe, and then I was kissing him -- his chest, his shoulder, his neck -- every part of him that I could reach. Slowly, my brain started to work again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," she said, flinching again. "Riley never said her name. I didn't see that night… it was so dark, and it hurt…" Bree shuddered. "He didn't want us to be able to think of her. He said that our thoughts weren't safe…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道，”她说道，又畏惧起来，“赖利从来没有说过她的名字。那天晚上我没看见……天那么黑，那么痛……”布里颤抖起来，“他不许我们想起她，他说我们的思想不安全……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Riley told us that we had to destroy the strange yellow-eyes here," Bree babbled quickly and willingly. "He said it would be easy. He said that the city was theirs, and they were coming to get us. He said once they were gone, all the blood would be ours. He gave us her scent." Bree lifted one hand and stabbed a finger in my direction. "He said we would know that we had the right coven, because she would be with them. He said whoever got to her first could have her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“赖利告诉我们，我们得摧毁这个奇怪的黄眼睛，”布里噼里啪啦地说道，语速很快，而且心甘情愿，“他说这会很容易，他说城市是他们的，他们会赶来除掉我们。他说一旦他们消失了，所有的血就都是我们的了。他给了我们她的气味，”布里抬起一只手，手指指着我的方向，“他说我们会知道我们要找的团体，因为她会跟他们在一起。他说谁第一个找到她，谁就能得到她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carlisle's face was very smooth as he nodded. "We split up, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔的脸非常平静，他说道：“我们也分散了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bree nodded, seeming relieved that the conversation had taken this non-painful course. She sat up carefully. "I don't know what happened. We split up, but the others never came. And Riley left us, and he didn't come to help like he promised. And then it was so confusing, and everybody was in pieces." She shuddered again. "I was afraid. I wanted to run away. That one --" she looked at Carlisle " -- said they wouldn't hurt me if I stopped fighting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里点点头，谈话不必那么痛苦地进行，这似乎让她觉得很欣慰。她小心翼翼地坐了起来：“我不知道发生了什么事。我们分头行动，但是其他人都没有来。赖利离开我们，他没有像他保证的那样过来帮助我们。接着，事情乱作一团，每个人都成了碎片。”她又战栗起来，“我很害怕，我想跑开，那个——”她看着卡莱尔，“——如果我停止打斗，他们就不会伤害我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, but that wasn't his gift to offer, young one," Jane murmured, her voice oddly gentle now. "Broken rules demand a consequence."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jane half-smiled. "I can't deny that I'm impressed." The big shadows behind her murmured in agreement. "I've never seen a coven escape this magnitude of offensive intact. Do you know what was behind it? It seems like extreme behavior, considering the way you live here. And why was the girl the key?" Her eyes rested unwilling on me for one short second.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="简似笑非笑地说道：“我无法否认这令我印象深刻。”她身后的大影子低声表示同意，“我从来没见过一个团体逃脱如此巨大的攻击而毫发无损，你知道这之后是什么吗？”这似乎是极端的行为，考虑到你们在此的生活方式。为什么这个女孩是关键？”她的眼睛不情愿地停留在我身上，看了我一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, it appears that there's not much left for us to do. Odd," Jane said, apathy creeping back into her voice. "We're not used to being rendered unnecessary. It's too bad we missed the fight. It sounds like it would have been entertaining to watch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，似乎没剩下什么需要我们来做的了，真奇怪，”简说道，冷漠又回到她的声音里，“我们不习惯被认为不需要，我们错过战斗实在是太糟糕了，听起来在一旁观战会很有意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
