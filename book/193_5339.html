<div class="line_en">The only sound Mortati could now hear was the anomalous hum of a television camera in back -- an electronic presence no conclave in history had ever endured -- but a presence demanded by the camerlegno. To the utter astonishment of the cardinals, the camerlegno had entered the Sistine Chapel with two BBC reporters -- a man and a woman -- and announced that they would be transmitting his solemn statement, live to the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting in the Sistine Chapel among his stunned colleagues, Cardinal Mortati tried to comprehend the words he was hearing. Before him, lit only by the candlelight, the camerlegno had just told a tale of such hatred and treachery that Mortati found himself trembling. The camerlegno spoke of kidnapped cardinals, branded cardinals, murdered cardinals. He spoke of the ancient Illuminati -- a name that dredged up forgotten fears -- and of their resurgence and vow of revenge against the church. With pain in his voice, the camerlegno spoke of his late Pope… the victim of an Illuminati poisoning. And finally, his words almost a whisper, he spoke of a deadly new technology, antimatter, which in less than two hours threatened to destroy all of Vatican City.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Science may have alleviated the miseries of disease and drudgery and provided an array of gadgetry for our entertainment and convenience, but it has left us in a world without wonder. Our sunsets have been reduced to wavelengths and frequencies. The complexities of the universe have been shredded into mathematical equations. Even our self-worth as human beings has been destroyed. Science proclaims that Planet Earth and its inhabitants are a meaningless speck in the grand scheme. A cosmic accident." He paused. "Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone. We are bombarded with violence, division, fracture, and betrayal. Skepticism has become a virtue. Cynicism and demand for proof has become enlightened thought. Is it any wonder that humans now feel more depressed and defeated than they have at any point in human history? Does science holdanything sacred? Science looks for answers by probing our unborn fetuses. Science even presumes to rearrange our own DNA. It shatters God's world into smaller and smaller pieces in quest of meaning… and all it finds is more questions."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提敬畏地看著。总司库现在简直能把人催眠。在梵蒂冈祭坛上，莫塔提从没看过谁的动作和声音能散发出那麽强烈的力量。总司库的声音裡融合了强烈的说服力，又带著沉重的哀伤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The ancient war between science and religion is over," the camerlegno said. "You have won. But you have not won fairly. You have not won by providing answers. You have won by so radically reorienting our society that the truths we once saw as signposts now seem inapplicable. Religion cannot keep up. Scientific growth is exponential. It feeds on itself like a virus. Every new breakthrough opens doors for new breakthroughs. Mankind took thousands of years to progress from the wheel to the car. Yet only decades from the car into space. Now we measure scientific progress in weeks. We are spinning out of control. The rift between us grows deeper and deeper, and as religion is left behind, people find themselves in a spiritual void. We cry out for meaning. And believe me, wedo cry out. We see UFOs, engage in channeling, spirit contact, out-of-body experiences, mindquests -- all these eccentric ideas have a scientific veneer, but they are unashamedly irrational. They are the desperate cry of the modern soul, lonely and tormented, crippled by its own enlightenment and its inability to accept meaning in anything removed from technology."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「科学和宗教的古老战争结束了。」总司库说。「你们已经赢了。但你们赢得并不公平。你们不是靠提供答案赢得胜利，而是靠彻底改变整个社会的方向，彻底到我们一度视为路标的真理，现在都好像不适用了。宗教跟不上这种剧烈的改变。科学以指数式的速度成长，像病毒般迅速滋长壮大。每个新突破都开启了通往其他新突破的门。人类花了几千年才从轮子进步到汽车。但只又花了几十年就从汽车进步到太空。现在我们衡量科学的进步，是以几个星期为单位。我们已经快得无法控制了。我们之间的裂痕愈来愈深，一旦捨弃了宗教，人们就发现自己处于精神上的真空。我们呐喊著寻找意义。相信我，我们真的是呐喊。我们看到了幽浮，从事通灵、心灵交会、灵魂出窍体验、心灵探索──这些反常的概念都披著科学的外衣，却是不折不扣的非理性。那是现代灵魂的绝望呐喊，寂寞又痛苦，这些灵魂瘫痪了，因为自己的启蒙，也因为无能接受任何科技之外的意义。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The camerlegno was talking more forcefully now. "Science, you say, will save us. Science, I say, has destroyed us. Since the days of Galileo, the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means, but always with benevolent intention. Even so, the temptations are too great for man to resist. I warn you, look around yourselves. The promises of science have not been kept. Promises of efficiency and simplicity have bred nothing but pollution and chaos. We are a fractured and frantic species… moving down a path of destruction."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库现在语气更加强而有力了。「你们说，科学会拯救我们。我说，科学会摧毁我们。从伽利略的时代起，教会就试图要减缓科学不断前进的速度，有时会採取错误的手段，但始终是出于善意。即使如此，科学进步的诱惑实在大到让凡人无法抗拒。我要警告你们，看看你们周遭。科学的承诺并没有兑现。科学承诺要带来效率和简化，结果只製造出污染和混乱。我们成了破裂而狂乱的碎片……走向一条毁灭之路。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati could feel himself leaning forward in his seat. He and the other cardinals and people around the world were hanging on this priest's every utterance. The camerlegno spoke with no rhetoric or vitriol. No references to scripture or Jesus Christ. He spoke in modern terms, unadorned and pure. Somehow, as though the words were flowing from God himself, he spoke the modern language… delivering the ancient message. In that moment, Mortati saw one of the reasons the late Pope held this young man so dear. In a world of apathy, cynicism, and technological deification, men like the camerlegno, realists who could speak to our souls like this man just had, were the church's only hope.</div>

Our resources are drying up from our campaign to be the voice of balance as you plow blindly on in your quest for smaller chips and larger profits. We ask not why you will not govern yourselves, but how can you? Your world moves so fast that if you stop even for an instant to consider the implications of your actions, someone more efficient will whip past you in a blur. So you move on. You proliferate weapons of mass destruction, but it is the Pope who travels the world beseeching leaders to use restraint. You clone living creatures, but it is the church reminding us to consider the moral implications of our actions. You encourage people to interact on phones, video screens, and computers, but it is the church who opens its doors and reminds us to commune in person as we were meant to do. You even murder unborn babies in the name of research that will save lives. Again, it is the church who points out the fallacy of this reasoning.</div>

I say use your telescopes to look to the heavens, and tell me how there couldnot be a God!" The camerlegno had tears in his eyes now. "You ask what does God look like. I say, where did that question come from? The answers are one and the same. Do you not see God in your science? How can you miss Him! You proclaim that even the slightest change in the force of gravity or the weight of an atom would have rendered our universe a lifeless mist rather than our magnificent sea of heavenly bodies, and yet you fail to see God's hand inthis?

Religion is flawed, but only becauseman is flawed. If the outside world could see this church as I do… looking beyond the ritual of these walls… they would see a modern miracle… a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control."</div>
