<div class="line_en">He never understood why she chose him. She loved only abstract things like music and books and strange words. Ove was a man entirely filled with tangible things. He liked screwdrivers and oil filters. He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You don't fool me, darling," she said with a playful little smile and crept into his big arms. "You're dancing on the inside, Ove, when no one's watching. And I'll always love you for that. Whether you like it or not."</div>

<div class="line_en">People always said Ove and Ove's wife were like night and day. Ove realized full well, of course, that he was the night. It didn't matter to him.

<div class="line_en">Because a time comes in every man's life when he decides what sort of man he's going to be: the kind who lets other people walk all over him, or not.</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew very well that some people thought he was nothing but a grumpy old sod without any faith in people. But, to put it bluntly, that was because people had never given him reason to see it another way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他非常清楚地知道，有人认为他只是个固执的老头，从不信任别人。但简而言之，别人也从来没有给他反驳的理由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove never quite fathomed what she meant by that. He'd never been one for dancing. It seemed far too haphazard and giddy. He liked straight lines and clear decisions. That was why he had always liked mathematics. There were right or wrong answers there. Not like the other hippie subjects they tried to trick you into doing at school, where you could "argue your case." As if that was a way of concluding a discussion: checking who knew more long words. Ove wanted what was right to be right, and what was wrong to be wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维从来不知道她说这话是什么意思。他从来不是跳舞的料，舞蹈总是显得那么随意而迷惘。他喜欢直线，以及明确的信息，所以他喜欢数学，总有个是非对错。不像学校里其他那些糊弄人的学科，还可以“强词夺理”。仿佛这还是一种结束讨论的方法：看谁掌握的大词多。对欧维来说，是即是，非即非。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove slept in the Saab the nights after the fire. The first morning he tried to clear up among the ashes and destruction. The second morning he had to accept that this would never sort itself out. The house was lost, and all the work he had put into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火灾后的那一夜，欧维睡在萨博里。第一个清晨，他试图在灰烬和废墟中亲手清理现场。第二天早上，他终于接受一切不复存在的事实。房子毁了，他为房子付出的一切努力都毁了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He hated those men in white shirts. He couldn't remember having hated anyone before, but now it was like a ball of fire inside. Ove's parents had bought this house. Ove had grown up here. Learned to walk. His father had taught him everything there was to know about a Saab engine here. And after all that, someone at a municipal authority decided something else should be built here. And a man with a round face sold insurance that was not insurance. A man in a white shirt prevented Ove from putting out a fire and now two other white shirts stood here talking about a "market price."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他恨这些穿白衬衫的男人。他不记得自己曾如此仇恨过任何人，但现在仇恨就像心中的一团火球。欧维的父母买了这套房子。欧维在这里成长，蹒跚学步，父亲教会他关于萨博发动机的一切。然后政府里的人就决定要在这儿造点儿什么别的东西。一个圆脸男人卖给他一份不是保险的保险。一个穿白衬衫的男人不让欧维救火，现在又来了两个穿白衬衫的男人满嘴“市价”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He left the plot where once his parental home had stood, and he never looked back. Rented a little room from an old lady in town. Sat and stared desolately at the wall all day.

In the morning, he and the other workers were told not to go to their usual changing rooms; they had to go back to the head office to pick up new sets of work clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe it was because Tom had put the blame on him for the theft in the carriage. Maybe it was the fire. Maybe it was the bogus insurance agent. Or the white shirts. Or maybe it was just enough now. There and then, it was as if someone had removed a fuse in Ove's mind. Everything in his eyes grew a shade darker. He walked out of the changing room, still naked and with water dripping from his flexing muscles. Walked to the end of the corridor to the foremen's changing room, kicked the door open, and cleared a way through the astonished press of men inside. Tom was standing in front of a mirror at the far end, trimming his bushy beard. Ove gripped him by the shoulder and roared so loudly that the sheet-metal-covered walls echoed.</div>

The recruitment officer liked this taciturn young man who seemed as strong as a bear, and he pressed him to consider a career as a professional soldier. Ove thought it sounded good. Military personnel wore uniforms and followed orders. All knew what they were doing. All had a function. Things had a place. Ove felt he could actually be good as a soldier.
