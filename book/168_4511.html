<div class="line_en">"The inn was still open when last I passed this way," said Ser Cleos Frey. "They brewed a fine ale. Perhaps there is still some to be had in the cellars."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jaime was the first to spy the inn. The main building hugged the south shore where the river bent, its long low wings outstretched along the water as if to embrace travelers sailing downstream. The lower story was grey stone, the upper whitewashed wood, the roof slate. He could see stables as well, and an arbor heavy with vines. "No smoke from the chimneys," he pointed out as they approached. "Nor lights in the windows."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆最先发现客栈。主建筑坐落在弯道南岸，又长又低的厢房伸展到河面上，好似要拥抱过往旅客。客栈底层由灰石砌成，上层用了石灰粉刷的木材，顶棚则铺上石板。它带有马厩，还有座爬满藤蔓的凉亭。“烟囱没烟，”接近后他提示，“窗户也没亮光。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She gave no answer, but after a moment she pushed at the tiller to angle the skiff in toward the weathered wooden dock. Ser Cleos scrambled to take down the sail. When they bumped softly against the pier, he climbed out to tie them up. Jaime clambered after him, made awkward by his chains.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Torrhen had brought his power south after the fall of the two kings on the Field of Fire," said Jaime, "but when he saw Aegon's dragon and the size of his host, he chose the path of wisdom and bent his frozen knees." He stopped at the sound of a horse's whinny. "Horses in the stable. One at least." And one is all I need to put the wench behind me. "Let's see who's home, shall we?" Without waiting for an answer, Jaime went clinking down the dock, put a shoulder to the door, shoved it open…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当托伦带着大军南下时，河湾王和凯岩王已在怒火燎原之役中一败涂地，”詹姆道，“他亲眼目睹伊耿的巨龙和军队，于是便作出了明智的选择，弯下自己结冰的膝盖。”突然传来一匹马的嘶鸣。“哎，马厩里居然还有一匹马，真不简单。”一匹便足以让我远走高飞。“哈哈，让我们瞧瞧这是谁的家？”不等回答，詹姆便拖着叮当作响的镣铐冲下码头，肩膀靠在客栈门上，用力一推…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the end of the dock, a flaking shingle swung from an iron post, painted with the likeness of a king upon his knees, his hands pressed together in the gesture of fealty. Jaime took one look and laughed aloud. "We could not have found a better inn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="码头远端，一根铁柱上摇晃着一面脆弱的招牌，依稀看得出画了一位下跪的国王，双手合拢，以示臣服。詹姆一眼瞧去，不由得笑出声来，“妙，这客栈太妙了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Cleos answered. "This is the Inn of the Kneeling Man, my lady. it stands upon the very spot where the last King in the North knelt before Aegon the Conqueror to offer his submission. That's him on the sign, I suppose."</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, he had the power to match Robert Baratheon drink for drink, and there were few enough who could say that. Jaime had once heard Thoros tell the king that he became a red priest because the robes hid the winestains so well. Robert had laughed so hard he'd spit ale all over Cersei's silken mantle. "Far be it from me to make objection," he said, "but perhaps the Trident is not our safest course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，能跟劳勃·拜拉席恩来个一醉方休的本领确实高强。詹姆曾听这个索罗斯向国王夸口，之所以选择当红袍僧全因这身袍子能隐藏葡萄酒的痕迹，劳勃听了轰然大笑，喝下去的麦酒全喷在瑟曦的银丝披风上。“或许我没资格反对，”他说，“但依我之见，走三叉戟河似乎不妥。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Jaime did not recognize the original colors, but he recognized bloodstains easily enough. "Well, her owner won't be coming to claim her anytime soon." He examined the palfrey's legs, counted the gelding's teeth. "Give him a gold piece for the grey, if he'll include the saddle," he advised Brienne. "A silver for the plow horse.

<div class="line_en">Jaime's investiture freed him from Lysa Tully. Elsewise, nothing went as planned. His father had never been more furious. He could not object openly -- Cersei had judged that correctly -- but he resigned the Handship on some thin pretext and returned to Casterly Rock, taking his daughter with him. Instead of being together, Cersei and Jaime just changed places, and he found himself alone at court, guarding a mad king while four lesser men took their turns dancing on knives in his father's ill-fitting shoes. So swiftly did the Hands rise and fall that Jaime remembered their heraldry better than their faces. The hornof-plenty Hand and the dancing griffins Hand had both been exiled, the mace-and-dagger Hand dipped in wildfire and burned alive. Lord Rossart had been the last. His sigil had been a burning torch; an unfortunate choice, given the fate of his predecessor, but the alchemist had been elevated largely because he shared the king's passion for fire. I ought to have drowned Rossart instead of gutting him.</div>

<div class="line_en">But when he closed his eyes, it was Aerys Targaryen he saw, pacing alone in his throne room, picking at his scabbed and bleeding hands. The fool was always cutting himself on the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne. Jaime had slipped in through the king's door, clad in his golden armor, sword in hand. The golden armor, not the white, but no one ever remembers that. Would that I had taken off that damned cloak as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁知闭上眼睛，见到的却是伊里斯·坦格利安。国王独自在王座厅内踱步，那双长满疙瘩、浸染鲜血的手不住绞动。这蠢货常被铁王座上的倒钩和尖刺弄得鲜血淋漓。詹姆静静地走进来，身穿黄金战甲，利剑在手。黄金战甲，不是白的，但从没有人想到过。我该把那可恨的袍子也脱掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

Whose?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊里斯看见剑上的血，想知道那是不是泰温公爵的血。“我要他死，这叛徒。我要他的脑袋，你快把他的脑袋献上，否则我将你一起烧死！和所有的叛徒一起烧死！罗萨特说敌人进了城，他会好好招待他们的。说！这是谁的血？谁的！？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Rossart's," answered Jaime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“罗萨特的，”詹姆回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those purple eyes grew huge then, and the royal mouth drooped open in shock. He lost control of his bowels, turned, and ran for the Iron Throne. Beneath the empty eyes of the skulls on the walls, Jaime hauled the last dragonking bodily off the steps, squealing like a pig and smelling like a privy. A single slash across his throat was all it took to end it. So easy, he remembered thinking. A king should die harder than this. Rossart at least had tried to make a fight of it, though if truth be told he fought like an alchemist. Queer that they never ask who killed Rossart… but of course, he was no one, lowborn, Hand for a fortnight, just another mad fancy of the Mad King.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那对紫色的眼睛陡然睁大，那张高贵的嘴巴因震惊而张开。他完全发了疯，转过身去，奔向铁王座。在高墙上无数巨龙的空洞眼窟注视下，詹姆把末代龙王拖下台阶，听他像猪狗一般地尖叫，闻到屎尿齐流的恶臭，然后用黄金宝剑切开国王的喉咙。好简单啊，他时时忆起那一时刻，国王不该就这样死去吧？罗萨特虽是个无能的火术士，至少还想反抗呢。也真奇怪，他们从不问谁杀掉了罗萨特…唉，怎会有人关心呢？他出身低贱，仅当了两个星期的首相，不过是疯王的又一疯行罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Elys Westerling and Lord Crakehall and others of his father's knights burst into the hall in time to see the last of it, so there was no way for Jaime to vanish and let some braggart steal the praise or blame. It would be blame, he knew at once when he saw the way they looked at him… though perhaps that was fear. Lannister or no, he was one of Aerys's seven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊利·维斯特林爵士、克雷赫伯爵及父亲麾下其他骑士刚好在这时冲进大厅，所以詹姆既没办法消失，也没给牛皮大王们留下盗窃赞美或谴责的机会。只有谴责！看见他们的眼神，他立刻就明白了…还有恐惧。是啊，不管他姓不姓兰尼斯特，终究是伊里斯的七卫之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shall I proclaim a new king as well?" Crakehall asked, and Jaime read the question plain: Shall it be your father, or Robert Baratheon, or do you mean to try to make a new dragonking? He thought for a moment of the boy Viserys, fled to Dragonstone, and of Rhaegar's infant son Aegon, still in Maegor's with his mother. A new Targaryen king, and my father as Hand. How the wolves will howl, and the storm lord choke with rage. For a moment he was tempted, until he glanced down again at the body on the floor, in its spreading pool of blood. His blood is in both of them, he thought. "Proclaim who you bloody well like," he told Crakehall. Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated himself with his sword across his knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom. As it happened, it had been Eddard Stark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是否宣布新王诞生？”克雷赫问。詹姆懂他的暗示：是你父亲，是劳勃·拜拉席恩，还是另立新的龙王？他想到逃去龙石岛的小王子韦赛里斯，想到雷加的幼儿伊耿——这时还在梅葛楼他母亲怀中呢。一位新的坦格利安君主，重新当上首相的父亲。如此一来，狼仔们该如何嗥叫，而那风暴之王又该如何来咽下怒火啊。刹那间，他被迷住了，直到再度看见脚下的尸首，那泓血池正越变越大。“他”的血也流在他俩身上，詹姆心想。“你他妈爱怎么宣布就怎么宣布，”他告诉克雷赫，接着爬进铁王座，剑陈于膝，安坐高堂，要看看谁前来领走王国。最后，来了艾德·史塔克。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The castle is ours, ser, and the city," Roland Crakehall told him, which was half true. Targaryen loyalists were still dying on the serpentine steps and in the armory, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor's Holdfast, and Ned Stark was leading his northmen through the King's Gate even then, but Crakehall could not have known that. He had not seemed surprised to find Aerys slain; Jaime had been Lord Tywin's son long before he had been named to the Kingsguard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城堡属于我们了，爵士，市区也一样，”罗兰德·克雷赫告诉他，但这并非完全属实。在螺旋梯上，军械库里，坦格利安的死党仍旧顽抗，格雷果·克里冈和亚摩利·洛奇正加紧攀登梅葛楼的墙垒，而奈德·史塔克和他的北方人正从国王门鱼贯而入。这些克雷赫都不清楚，他甚至对伊里斯的死也无动于衷：詹姆十多年来都是泰温公爵的儿子，身为御林铁卫才不过一载，有什么好奇怪的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
