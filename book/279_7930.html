<div class="line_en">The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the percussion–cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆的至友乔·哈帕就坐在他旁边。和汤姆一样，乔·哈帕终于有了出头之日。看见扁虱，他很感激，一下子对它产生了浓厚的兴趣。这两个朋友平日里是莫逆之交，可到了星期六就成了对阵的敌人。乔从衣服的翻领上取下别针，开始帮着操练这个小俘虏。这种玩法立刻有趣多了。不久，汤姆说两个人玩一样东西既不方便也不过瘾。因此他把乔的写字板放到桌子上，在写字板正中间从上到下划了一条直线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扁虱很快就从汤姆这边逃出去，爬过了界线。乔捉玩了一阵，它又逃掉，跑到汤姆那边。这样扁虱经常来回两边跑，因此当一个孩子全神贯注地担心扁虱会逃到另一边时，另外一个也饶有兴趣地在一旁看着。两个脑袋都凑得很近盯着写字板，对周围发生的一切，他俩全然不顾。后来乔好像非常走运。那扁虱这儿走走，那儿走走，然后又换一边走走，它和两个孩子一样既兴奋又着急。可是一次又一次，正当它好像是有把握可以获得胜利，汤姆的手指也正在急着要去拨它的时候，乔用别针灵巧地把它拨了一下，又叫它转回头，还是留在他这边。最后汤姆实在是忍无可忍，诱惑实在太大了。于是他伸出手去，用他的别针拨了一下。乔这下子也生气了，说：">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed.
