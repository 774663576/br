<div class="line_en">When Dunstan Cass left the cottage, Silas Marner was only a hundred metres away. He was walking home from the village, where he had gone to buy what he needed for his next day's work. His legs were tired, but he felt almost happy. He was looking forward to supper-time, when he would bring out his gold. Tonight he had an extra reason to hurry home. He was going to eat hot meat, which was unusual for him. And it would cost him nothing, because someone had given him a piece of meat as a present. He had left it cooking over the fire. The door key was needed to hold it safely in place, but Silas was not at all worried about leaving his gold in the cottage with the door unlocked. He could not imagine that a thief would find his way through the mist, rain and darkness to the little cottage by the quarry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓斯坦·凯斯离开的时候，西拉斯仅仅在100米之外，他从村里买了第二天干活用的东西，正往家里走。西拉斯的腿很累，但他心里很高兴。他期待着晚饭时间的到来，那时他又可以拿出金子来了。今晚他匆匆回家还有个特别的理由，他今天要吃一块热热的烤肉，平时他很少吃肉。不过他并没有花钱，因为这块肉是别人送给他的礼物。他出来时已经把它烤在了火上，肉是用大门钥匙串起来的，西拉斯一点儿也不担心不锁门而把金币留在小屋里，他不信会有贼能在这样的大雾、大雨里摸黑找到他在采石场边上的小草屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he reached his cottage and opened the door, he did not notice that anything was different. He threw off his wet coat, and pushed the meat closer to the fire. As soon as he was warm again, he began to think about his gold. It seemed a long time to wait until after supper, when he usually brought out the coins to look at. So he decided to bring out his gold immediately, while the meat was still cooking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回到家，打开门，没有发现任何异常。他脱下湿衣服，把肉向火上推了推，一暖和过来，他马上开始想他的金子。他不能像平时那样等到吃完晚饭再把金子拿出来，那要等太久了，他决定趁肉还在烤着，马上拿出金子来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when he took up the floorboards near the loom, and saw the empty hole, he did not understand at once. His heart beat violently as his trembling hands felt all round the hole. There was nothing there! He put his hands to his head and tried to think. Had he put his gold in a different place, and forgotten about it? He searched every corner of his small cottage, until he could not pretend to himself any more. He had to accept the truth -- his gold had been stolen!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他扒开织机旁的地板，看到洞里空空的什么也没有时，并没有马上明白过来。他的心剧烈地跳着，用颤抖的手把洞摸了个遍，什么也没有！他用手抱着头，想好好想一想。是不是自己把金子放在了别处又忘了？他找遍了草屋的每一个角落，但终于一无所获，他不能再欺骗自己了。他不得不接受这一事实——他的金子被偷走了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave a wild, desperate scream, and stood still for a moment. Then he turned towards his loom, and almost fell into the seat where he always worked. He touched the loom to make sure it, too, had not been stolen. Now he was beginning to think more clearly. "A thief has been here! If I can find him, he'll have to give back my gold! But I was only away for a short time, and there's no sign of anyone entering the cottage. "He wondered whether it was really a thief who had taken his money, or whether it was the same cruel God who had already destroyed his happiness once. But Silas preferred to suspect a thief, who would perhaps return the money. He began to think it must be Jem Rodney, a local poacher, who had known about Silas's money, and who sometimes visited the cottage. Silas felt stronger now that he thought he knew the thief. "I must go and tell the Squire, and the police!"he said to himself. "They'll make Jem give me back the money!"so he hurried out in the rain without a coat, and ran towards the Rainbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发出一声绝望的惨叫，呆呆地站了一会儿，猛地转向织机，险些跌倒在每天干活的座位上。西拉斯摸着织布机以确定他的织布机还没有被偷走。这时他的思想清楚了一些。“一定是有贼来过！如果我能找出这个人，他就得把金子还给我！可我只离开了一会儿，也看不出有人进过屋呀！”他不明白是真的有贼偷走了他的钱，还是那个曾经毁坏过他幸福生活的残忍的上帝又在惩治他。不过西拉斯宁愿怀疑是贼干的，因为贼还可能把钱还回来。他开始猜想贼一定是本地的偷猎者杰姆·罗德尼，因为他知道西拉斯有钱，而且以前来过小屋。西拉斯以为自己知道贼是谁了，就感到自己强大了点儿。“我必须去告诉乡绅和警察！”他对自己说，“他们会让杰姆还我钱。”于是他来不及披外衣就冲进雨里，向彩虹酒馆跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then Silas's white face appeared suddenly in the doorway. He had run all the way from his cottage, so he could not speak for a moment. He stared silently at the men with his strange staring eyes, looking exactly like a ghost. For a few minutes nobody said anything, while Silas tried to control his breathing. Then the landlord spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时西拉斯苍白的脸突然出现在过道里。他从草屋一路跑来，所以一时说不出话来，只是不声不响地用那双奇怪的、直瞪着的眼睛盯着人们，确实有点儿像一个鬼。半晌没有人说话，而西拉斯则在努力地使自己呼吸平稳下来。然后酒馆主人打破了沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought he would find the most important people in Raveloe at the public house, but in fact most of them were at Mrs Osgood's birthday dance. There were, however, five villagers at the Rainbow, enjoying an interesting conversation about ghosts, while drinking their beer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西拉斯本以为一定能在酒馆见到瑞福洛最重要的人们，可实际上大部分人都去参加奥斯古德太太的生日舞会了。然而还是有5个村民在酒馆中一边喝着啤酒，一边闲谈着有关鬼怪的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The weaver sat down, in the centre of the little group of men, and told his story. It felt strange but pleasant to him, to talk to his neighbours and tell them his problems.

<div class="line_en">Next morning, when the whole village heard about the stolen gold, they all discussed it excitedly. A few people still did not trust Silas or believe his story. Most people, however, were suspicious of the pedlar who had visited Raveloe the month before. Perhaps he had returned to hide near the quarry, and steal the money when Silas left his cottage. Several villagers thought they remembered his evil-looking face, and felt sure he was not honest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，全村人都听说了丢金子的事，大家都在兴奋地议论，一小部分人仍然不相信西拉斯和他的故事，而大多数人都怀疑上个月来过瑞福洛的小贩，没准儿他溜回来藏在了采石场附近，然后趁西拉斯出门的时候偷了钱。有几个村民更是想起来他们早就从小贩那张罪恶的脸上看出他不是好人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Silas himself remembered that the pedlar had come to his cottage door recently.
