<div class="line_en">But he could hardly remember that last interview of theirs without mortification: to a man so vain as Townsend it must be galling like an ulcer that would not heal. She hoped that she had hurt him as much as he had hurt her. He must hate her now. She was glad to think that she did not hate, but only despised him. It gave her a sardonic satisfaction to reflect that whatever his feelings he would be obliged to make much of her. When she left his office that afternoon he must have hoped with all his heart that he would never set eyes on her again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Townsends lived on the Peak in a house with a wide view over the sea, and Charlie did not as a rule come up to luncheon, but on the day of Kity's arrival Dorothy (they were Kitty and Dorothy to one another by now) told her that if she felt up to seeing him he would like to come and bid her welcome. Kitty reflected that since she must see him she might just as well see him at once, and she looked forward with grim amusement to the embarrassment she must cause him. She saw very well that the invitation to stay had arisen in his wife's fancy and notwithstanding his own feelings he had immediately approved. Kitty knew how great his desire was always to do the right thing, and to offer her a gracious hospitality was obviously very much the right thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐生一家的住所是坐落于山顶的一座濒海公寓。通常查理不回家吃午饭，但因为今天是凯蒂回来的日子，多萝西说（现在还只有凯蒂和多萝西两人），若她有意想见见他，那么他很乐意赶过来向她致以问候。凯蒂思忖着既然早晚都要见到他，不如干脆现在就见。她还期待着看他的好戏呢，瞧瞧见了她以后他该是怎样地窘迫不安。她可以断定邀请凯蒂的主意是他妻子想出来的，而他虽然有难言之隐，但是也立马爽快地答应了。凯蒂知道他凡事力求做到恰当得体，而对她的热情款待无疑应属此列。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now, sitting with Dorothy, she waited for him to come in. She was conscious of her delight in the sober luxury of the drawing-room. She sat in an arm-chair, there were lovely flowers here and there, on the walls were pleasing pictures; the room was shaded and cool, it was friendly and homelike. She remembered with a faint shudder the bare and empty parlour of the missionary's bungalow; the rattan chairs and the kitchen table with its cotton cloth, the stained shelves with all those cheap editions of novels, and the little skimpy red curtains that had such a dusty look. Oh, it had been so uncomfortable! She supposed that Dorothy had never thought of that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂和多萝西一同坐下，静候着查理的到来。这间华而不奢的客厅让她感到心情愉快。她坐在一把沙发椅里，四处都摆放着鲜花，墙上挂着美观的油画。窗户用帘子遮起来了，房间里显得十分清凉，弥漫着一种温馨、宁静的气氛。她想起了传教士的那座平房，里面的客厅粗陋不堪，空无一物。她想起了那些藤条椅和厨房里的那张大餐桌以及桌上铺的棉布，想起了褪色的书架上那些廉价的小说和窗户上那条小气的红色旧帘子。她不禁微微缩了一下身体，呃，它们使人那么地不舒服。那些东西多萝西这辈子恐怕连想也没有想过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm so very, very glad you've come here. I know Dorothy has told you that we want you to stay as long as ever you like and that we want you to look upon our house as your home. But I want to tell you so myself as well. If there's anything in the world I can do for you I shall only be too happy." His eyes wore a charming expression of sincerity; she wondered if he saw the irony in hers. "I'm awfully stupid at saying some things and I don't want to seem a clumsy fool, but I do want you to know how deeply I sympathize with you in your husband's death. He was a thundering good chap, and he'll be missed here more than I can say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你能来此我感到无比地高兴。我想多萝西已经说过，我们殷切地希望你能在此长住，把这里当作你自己的家。不过我还是要亲口向你申明一遍。如果这世界上有能为你效劳的，我将感到莫大的荣幸。”他的眼睛里含有一种迷人的恳切神情，她在想他有没有察觉她目光中的讥讽之意。“我天生驽钝，不会讲话，当然不想让自己成为口齿不灵的傻瓜，但是我想让你明白，我对你丈夫的过世表示深切的同情。他是一个非同寻常的善良之人，他在这里将受到无以言表的怀念。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，你应该来一点。”唐生摆出了他明朗、热情的姿态，“这对你有好处，我相信离开香港以后你还没尝过鸡尾酒这样的东西。除非我说湄潭府那地方水不结冰这话也是错的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
