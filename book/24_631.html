<div class="line_en">When Rupert Boyce sent out the invitations for his party, the total mileage involved was impressive. To list only the first dozen guests, there were the Fosters from Adelaide, the Shoenbergers from Haiti, the Farrans from Stalingrad, the Moravias from Cincinnati, the Ivankos from Paris, and the Sullivans from the general vicinity of Easter Island, but approximately four kilometres down on the ocean bed. It was a considerable compliment to Rupert that although thirty guests had been invited, over forty turned up -- which was about the percentage he had expected. Only the Krauses let him down, and that was simply because they forgot about the International Date Line and arrived twenty-four hours late.</div>

<div class="line_en">By noon an imposing collection of flyers had accumulated in the park, and the later arrivals would have quite a distance to walk once they had found somewhere to land. At least, it would seem quite a distance to them, under this cloudless sky and with the mercury at a hundred and ten. The assembled vehicles ranged from one-man Flitterbugs to family Cadillacs which were more like air-borne palaces than sensible flying machines. In this age, however, nothing could be deduced concerning the social status of the guests from their modes of transport.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将近中午时分，鲁柏特家附近的公园里停满了小飞机，后到的人只能停到更远的地方，再走回来。这天，晴空万里，气温华氏一百一十度，那段路显得格外漫长。小飞机像一个个小小的空中宫殿，如今，人们再也无法通过交通工具去判断一个人的社会地位了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">George had selected a landing place and was now diving purposefully towards it. They floated to rest between another Meteor and something that neither of them could identify. It looked very fast and, Jean thought, very uncomfortable. One of Rupert's technical friends, she decided, had probably built it himself. She had an idea that there was a law against that sort of thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治看好地方，俯冲下去，降落在两架飞机之间，一架流星飞机，另一架不知什么机型，看上去速度很快，坐起来却不会舒服。简怀疑它是鲁柏特的某个技师朋友的杰作，只是私造飞机是违法的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The heat hit them like a blast from a blow-torch as they stepped out of the flyer. It seemed to suck the moisture from their bodies, and George almost imagined that he could feel his skin cracking. It was partly their own fault, of course.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rupert's voice, slightly larger than life, boomed cheerfully in their ears. Their host was standing beside the flyer, a glass in each hand, looking down at them with a roguish expression. He looked down at them for the simple reason that he was about twelve feet tall; he was also semi-transparent. One could see right through him without much difficulty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们耳边突然响起鲁柏特兴高采烈的声音，他就站在飞机旁，一手端着一杯饮料，顽皮地俯视着他们，说俯视是因为他有十二英尺高。他的身体竟是半透明的，可以轻易看透。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun put an end to further conversation until they had reached the house. As they approached the front door (which was not very easy to distinguish from the rest of the glass wall facing them) it swung automatically open with a fanfare of trumpets. Jean guessed, correctly, that she would be heartily sick of that fanfare before the day was through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳火辣辣的，两人都不再说话，一路走到鲁柏特房前。房门和玻璃墙浑然一体，好不容易才分辨出房门，他们走过去，伴随着一声刺耳的喇叭，门自动开了。简觉得那声喇叭会折磨自己一整天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have you ever known Rupert not to get anything he wanted?" replied George. "That's just the toy for him. He can sit comfortably in his studio and go wandering round half of Africa. No heat, no bugs, no exertion -- and the icebox always in reach. I wonder what Stanley and Livingstone would have thought?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不知道他总喜欢新奇的东西吗？”乔治回答，“又一个新玩意儿。有了它，就可以舒舒服服地坐在家里，跑遍半个非洲，没有炎热，没有蚊虫，不用费劲，而且——有一个冰箱伸手可及。不知道斯坦德利和莱文斯顿知道了会嫉妒成什么样子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rupert nodded, put down one of his glasses on an invisible table, adjusted an equally invisible control, and promptly vanished from sight.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是简和乔治吧？”她一边说一边伸出手来，“很高兴见到你们。鲁柏特正在准备饮料来，我们去见见其他人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her voice was a rich contralto that sent little shivers running up and down George's back, as if someone was playing on his spine like a flute. He looked nervously at Jean, who had managed to force a somewhat artificial smile, and finally recovered his voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治感到她圆润的低音轻柔地抚过自己的脊背，痒酥酥的，脊柱好像变成了一把长笛被人轻轻吹着。他紧张地看看简，简挤出一丝笑容，就是不开口，他只得开口了：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was only one adjective that adequately described her. She was distracting. Even in a world where beauty was almost commonplace, men would turn their heads when she entered the room. She was, George guessed, about one quarter Negro; her features were practically Grecian and her hair was long and lustrous. Only the dark, rich texture of her skin -- the overworked word "chocolate" was the only one that described it -- revealed her mixed ancestry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她只能用一个词来形容，那就是美得让人“神魂颠倒”。就算在美女如云的地方，她走进房间的刹那，也同样会吸引无数男士的目光。轮廓分明的希腊脸型，浓密的长发，丰盈的深色肌肤，用巧克力色来形容再恰当不过。从肤色可以看出她是个混血儿，乔治估计她有四分之一的黑人血统。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The current Mrs. Boyce greeted them in the delicious coolness of the hall. She was, if truth be known, the main reason for the good turn-out of guests. Perhaps half of them would have come in any case to see Rupert's new house; the waverers had been decided by the reports of Rupert's new wife.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“很、很高兴见到你。我们一直盼着这次聚会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'll find plenty more over there," he said, waving one hand vaguely behind him while he adjusted controls with the other. "Just make yourselves at home. You know most of the people here -- Maia will introduce you to the rest. Good of you to come."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Rupert always gives such nice parties," put in Jean. By the way she accented the "always", one knew perfectly well she was thinking "Every time he gets married". George flushed slightly and gave Jean a glance of reproof, but there was no sign that their hostess noticed the barb. She was friendliness itself as she ushered them into the main lounge, already half packed with a representative collection of Rupert's numerous friends. Rupert himself was sitting at the console of what seemed to be a television engineer's control unit; it was, George assumed, the device that had projected his image out to meet them. He was busily demonstrating it by surprising two more arrivals as they descended into the parking place, but paused just long enough to greet Jean and George and to apologize for having given their drinks to somebody else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“鲁柏特总是举办一些很好的聚会。”简突然插嘴道，刻意强调了“总是”这个词，听的人都明白她心里想的是“他每次结婚的时候”。乔治脸红了，瞪了她一眼。女主人似乎没有注意到里面的讽刺意味，依然友好地把他们让进一间大休闲室里，那儿已经站了半屋子客人，鲁柏特本人坐在一个酷似电视导播用的控制台前面，乔治怀疑他们刚才在外面看到的影子就是从这台机器发射出去的。鲁柏特正忙着给另两位新到的客人制造惊奇，只停下来和他们打了声招呼，抱歉把饮料给了别人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">George quickly came back to normal as they investigated the wonders of Rupert's new abode. The house seemed very large for two people, but this was just as well in view of the frequent overloads it would have to handle. There were two stories, the upper considerably larger so that it overhung and provided shade around the ground floor. The degree of mechanization was considerable, and the kitchen closely resembled the cockpit of an airliner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治很快回过神来，跟着简参观鲁柏特的新居。这幢房子对两个人来说太大了，但如果经常要接待这么多的客人，就很合适。房子有两层，上面一层比楼下大很多，往外突出，在底楼四周投下一片阴凉。房里机械化程度很高，厨房简直就像飞机的机舱样复杂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good of you to invite us," said Jean, without much conviction. George had already departed towards the bar and she made her way after him, occasionally exchanging greetings with someone she recognized. About three-quarters of those present were perfect strangers, which was the normal state of affairs at one of Rupert's parties.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你邀请我们。”简淡淡地说。乔治已经往吧台去了，她赶紧跟在后面，不时和认识的人打招呼，差不多四分之三的人都不认识，鲁柏特的聚会总是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's explore," she said to George when they had refreshed themselves and waved to everyone they knew. "I want to look at the house."</div>

<div class="line_en">George, with a barely concealed backward look at Maia Boyce, followed after her. There was a faraway look in his eyes that Jean didn't like in the least. It was such a nuisance that men were fundamentally polygamous. On the other hand, if they weren't. Yes, perhaps it was better this way, after all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治跟在她身后，却情不自禁地回头望了一眼梅娅，眼光柔柔的。简最不喜欢他用这样的眼神看别人，男人从本质上讲都是好色的，但话说回来，如果他们不是这样…是啊，也许还是这样比较好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The library ran the whole width of the house, but was virtually divided into half a dozen small rooms by the great bookcases extending across it. These held, if George remembered correctly, some fifteen thousand volumes -- almost everything of importance that had ever been published on the nebulous subjects of magic, psychic research, divining, telepathy, and the whole range of elusive phenomena lumped in the category of paraphysics. It was a very peculiar hobby for anyone to have in this age of reason. Presumably it was simply Rupert's particular form of escapism.</div>

<div class="line_en">George noticed the smell the moment he entered the room. It was faint but penetrating, not so much unpleasant as puzzling.

<div class="line_en">Jean managed to suppress a nervous giggle. Their unexpected fellow guest was, she noticed, reading at the rate of a page every two seconds. She did not doubt that he was assimilating every word, and she wondered if he could manage to read a book with each eye. "And then, of course," she thought to herself, "he could go on to learn braille so he could use his fingers.

<div class="line_en">George let her chatter on, after he had made the introductions, hoping that she wouldn't say anything tactless. Like Jean, he had never seen an Overlord in the flesh. Though they mixed socially with government officials, scientists and others who dealt with them in the course of business, he had never heard of one being present at an ordinary private party. One inference was that this party was not as private as it seemed. Rupert's possession of a piece of Overlord equipment also hinted at this, and George began to wonder, in capital letters, just What Was Going On. He would have to tackle Rupert about this when he could get him into a corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was nothing really anthropomorphic about Rashaverak. George could understand the way in which, if seen from a distance by ignorant, terrified savages, the Overlords could be mistaken for winged men, and so could have given rise, to the conventional portrait of the Devil. From as close as this, however, some of the illusion vanished. The little horns (what function did they serve? wondered George) were as per specification, but the body was neither like that of a man nor of any animal Earth had ever known. Coming from a totally alien evolutionary tree, the Overlords were neither mammals, insects, nor reptiles. It was not even certain that they were vertebrates: their hard, external armour might well be their only supporting framework.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞沙维莱克完全没有一点人的形状，以原始人类那点可怜的知识和恐惧的心理，把他们看成鸟人也合情合理，传说中的魔王就是这种形象。近距离的观察让一切都变得真实。那对角小小的，不知作什么用？身体既不像人也不像地球上已知的其他任何生物；既不是哺乳动物，也不是昆虫，更不是爬行动物，就连是不是脊椎动物都难以界定，表层的厚壳可能就是他们身体的支架。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since the chairs were too small for him, Rashaverak was sitting on the floor, apparently quite at ease since he had ignored the cushions only a metre away. As a result his head was a mere two metres from the ground, and George had a unique chance of studying extra-terrestrial biology. Unfortunately, as he knew little about terrestrial biology, he was not able to learn much that he did not already know. Only the peculiar, and by no means unpleasant, acid odour was new to him. He wondered how humans smelt to the Overlords, and hoped for the best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对瑞沙维莱克的体型而言，椅子太小了，他干脆坐在地上，也没有用一米外的那些坐垫，显然觉得这样坐更舒服。他的头距离地面两米，乔治可以借此良机好好观察一下这个外星生命，可惜连地球上的生物他都知道得很少，自然不会有什么新发现，除了那股特殊的酸味。不知道这些外星人闻到的人类又是什么味道，但愿不难闻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rashaverak's wings were folded so that George could not see them clearly, but his tail, looking like a piece of armoured hose-pipe, lay neatly curled under him. The famous barb was not so much an arrowhead as a large, flat diamond. Its purpose, it was now generally accepted, was to give stability in flight, like the tail-feathers of a bird. From scanty facts and suppositions such as these, scientists had concluded that the Overlords came from a world of low gravity and very dense atmosphere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一双翅膀收在身后，看不见，尾巴像一根裹着坚硬外壳的水管，卷曲在身下，尾巴顶端的倒钩不太像人们说的那样呈箭头状，更像一个扁平的大菱形，它的作用和鸟尾巴一样，用来保持平衡，人们已经普遍接受了这种推测。根据这些特征，科学家们推测外星人可能生活在一个引力小、空气密度大的世界里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps I'd better go too," said Rashaverak, putting his book back on the shelf.

There were no other representatives of George's own profession, television studio design -- which was a good thing, as he wanted to get away from shop.

Lions and such-like are easy -- but trying to puncture a rhino from the air with an anesthetic dart is the devil of a job."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的病人只是狮子、大象、犀牛之类的大型动物，不包括那些成群的小动物，那样太不切实际。每天早上，我把按钮设置在一百米的飞行高度，然后就坐在屏幕前，巡视整个丛林，一旦发现需要治疗的动物，我就坐小飞机赶过去，但愿我的治疗能管用。有时也有麻烦事，比如要从飞机上发射麻醉动物用的飞标，狮子之类的还好说，要碰上犀牛就麻烦了，刺破犀牛的皮可不容易。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One reached the roof by taking the escalator to the first floor and then climbing the spiral stairway round the intake of the air-conditioning plant. This led, through a hatchway, out on to the wide, flat roof. Rupert's flyer was parked at one end; the centre area was a garden -- already showing signs of running wild -- and the rest was simply an observation platform with a few deck chairs placed on it. George flopped into one of these and regarded his surroundings with an imperial eye. He felt very much monarch of all he surveyed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他先乘扶梯来到楼上，然后顺着空调进风通道外的螺旋形梯子往上爬，再钻过一道门，就来到了平坦空旷的屋顶上。鲁柏特的小飞机停在一边，正中间是个花坛，花草已经开始凋零了，其余地方都空荡荡的，只放着几把躺椅，乔治蓦地坐下，观望着周围的一切，居然有一种帝王般的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just before sunset that George found his way up to the roof. For a number of excellent reasons he had a slight headache and felt like escaping front the noise and confusion downstairs. Jean, who was a much better dancer than he was, still seemed to be enjoying herself hugely and refused to leave. This annoyed George, who was beginning to feel alcoholically amorous, and he decided to have a quiet sulk beneath the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治找到上屋顶的路时，正是日落时分。心里想着好几件事，不免有些心烦，想离开喧闹嘈杂的聚会，找个地方静一静，简的舞跳的比他好，意犹未尽地不肯走，他又稍多喝了点酒，就赌气想一个人到星光下坐坐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, to put it mildly, quite a view. Rupert's house had been built on the edge of a great basin, which sloped downwards towards the east into swamplands and lakes five kilometres away. Westwards the land was flat and the jungle came almost to Rupert's back-door. But beyond the jungle, at a distance that must have been at least fifty kilometres, a line of mountains ran like a great wall out of sight to north and south.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风景真不错，房子建在盆地边缘的高坡上，向东地势逐渐降低，五公里之外已经是一片沼泽地和湖泊了，向右则地势平坦，丛林几乎挨到了房子的后门口。五十公里之外丛林的边缘，绵延起伏的群山像一堵巨大的城墙往南北延伸，不见尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their summits were streaked with snow, and the clouds above them were turning to fire as the sun descended on the last few minutes of its daily journey. As he looked at those remote ramparts, George felt awed into a sudden sobriety. The stars that sprang out in such indecent haste the moment the sun had set were completely strange to him. He looked for the Southern Cross, but without success. Though he knew very little of astronomy, and could recognize only a few constellations, the absence of familiar friends was disturbing. So were the noises drifting in from the jungle, uncomfortably close at band. Enough of this fresh air, thought George. I'll go back to the party before a vampire bat, or something equally pleasant, comes flying up to investigate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山峰上白雪皑皑，夕阳映得山头上的云彩像火一般红。看着这般景致，乔治清醒了。就在太阳消失的片刻，星星出现了，全是些不认识的星座。他对天文知识几乎一无所知，只认得很少几个星座，他寻找着熟悉的南十字座，没有找到，不免有些失望。丛林里传来各种怪声，近得让人害怕，新鲜空气也呼吸得差不多了，趁吸血蝙蝠之类的东西还没有出来，赶快回去吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the flame of the lighter -- George was fond of such antiques -- he could now recognize his fellow-guest, a strikingly handsome young negro whose name George had been told but had immediately forgotten, like those of the twenty other complete strangers at the party. However, there seemed something familiar about him, and suddenly George guessed the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治还是喜欢用打火机这种老古董，借着火光他看清了这位客人，一个非常英俊的年轻黑人，有人介绍过他，但转眼就把他的名字连同其他二十几位不认识的客人的名字一起忘得干干净净。他看上去很眼熟，乔治一下就明白了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was just starting to walk back when another guest emerged from the hatchway. It was now so dark that George could not see who it was, so he called out, "Hello, there. Have you had enough of it too?" His invisible companion laughed. "Rupert's starting to show some of his movies. I've seen them all before."</div>

<div class="line_en">The jungle was quiet now; as Jan leaned against the curving wall of the air intake, the only sound he could hear was the faint murmur of the house as It breathed through its mechanical lungs. He felt very much alone, which was the way he wanted to be. He also felt highly frustrated -- and that was something he had no desire to be at all.</div>
