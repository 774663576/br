<div class="line_en">The year was 1956. I was 9 years old. By some twist of fate, I attended the same public school where the rich people sent their kids. We were primarily a sugar plantation town. The managers of the plantation and the other affluent people of the town, such as doctors, business owners, and bankers, sent their children to this school, grades 1 to 6. After grade 6, their children were generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would have gone to a different school, with kids from families more like mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年是1956年，我9岁。由于命运的安排，我进了一所公立学校，许多富人把他们的孩子也送到那所学校。我们镇基本上是个糖料种植场，种植场的经理和其他富裕的人，比如医生、商人、银行家都把孩子送进了这所学校，一到六年级都有。六年级之后他们的孩子通常会被送进私立学校。因为我家就在这个街区，所以我也进了这所学校。如果我家住在街的另一边，或许我会去另外一所学校，和那些家庭背景与我差不多的孩子们在一起了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a smile. Some asked us what we were doing. To which we replied, "We can't tell you. It's a business secret."</div>

<div class="line_en">He agreed and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my first business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas on how to 1'make money. Occasionally we talked about all the "cool guys" at Jimmy's beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, for it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning came through our heads. It was an idea Mike had gotten from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had a business.</div>

<div class="line_en">The milk cartons were filled with plaster-of-Paris. The white powder everywhere was the plaster before we mixed it with water.

<div class="line_en">Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the driveway, since the production line blocked the carport. As he and his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals, with the toothpaste tubes being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the small steel pot, melted until they became liquid, and with my mom's pot holders we were pouring the lead through a small hole in the top of the milk cartons.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael and I met with his dad that morning at 8 o'clock. He was already busy and had been at work for more than an hour. His construction supervisor was just leaving in his pickup truck as I walked up to his simple, small and tidy home. Mike met me at the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克和我在那天上午8点和他爸爸会面了。他仍然很忙而且会面前已经工作了1个多小时了。他的建筑监理人刚坐着他的卡车离开，我就进了他那窄小而简朴整洁的家，迈克站在门口迎接我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who are those people?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们是什么人？”我问迈克。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses, and the women are the managers of the restaurants. And you saw the construction supervisor, who is working on a road project about 50 miles from here. His other supervisor, who is building a track of houses, had already left before you got here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，他们是给我爸干活的。那个老点的男人负责管理货仓，那两个女人是餐馆经理。刚才在门口你也看到建筑监理人了；他在离这儿50英里远的一个公路项目中工作。还有一些监理正在负责房屋建设的项目，不过他们在你到这里之前就已经走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old wooden floor creaked as I steppedacross the threshold of this aging house. There was a cheap mat just inside the door. The mat was there to hide the years of wear from countless footsteps that the floor had supported. Although clean, it needed to be replaced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我举步跨过这座老房子的门槛时，旧木地板发出“嘎嘎” 的响声。门内地板上有个廉价的垫子，这个垫子的磨损程度记录了经年累月无数次踏上这个地板的脚步，虽然很干净，但还是该换了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dad's on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch," Mike said as he opened the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我爸正在打电话，他让我们在走廊后面等着。”迈克边说边开门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt claustrophobic as I entered the narrow living room, which was filled with old musty overstuffed furniture that today would be collector's items. Sitting on the couch were two women, a little older than my mom. Across from the women sat a man in workman's clothes. He wore khaki slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but without starch, and polished work books. He was about 10 years older than my dad; I'd say about 45 years old. They smiled as Mike and I walked past them, heading for the kitchen, which lead to the porch that overlooked the back yard. I smiled back shyly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我进入到狭小的卧室时感到有些害怕，这间卧室里塞满了陈旧发霉而厚重的家具，它们早该成为收藏者的藏品了。在沙发上坐着两个女人，她们的岁数比我妈大一些，她们的后面还坐着一个穿工作服的男人。他穿着卡其布的衬衫和外套，衣服烫得很平整，但没有浆过，他手上拿着磨得发光的工作簿。他大概比我爸爸大10岁的样子，我想大概45岁吧。当我和迈克走过他们身边时他们冲我们微笑着，我们朝厨房走去，穿过橱房可以到后院。 我也有点腼腆地冲他们笑笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a big man, about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. My dad was taller, about the same weight, and five years older than Mike's dad. They sort of looked alike, though not of the same ethnic makeup. Maybe their energy was similar.</div>

<div class="line_en">I nodded my head quickly, but with a little intimidation. He had a lot of power behind his words and smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. Take it or leave it. I've got too much work to do to waste my time. If you can't make up you mind decisively, then you'll never learn to make money anyway. Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill. You have an opportunity that you asked for. School is beginning or it's over in ten seconds," Mike's dad said with a teasing smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">"OK, here's my offer. I'll teach you, but I won't do it classroom-style. You work for me, I'll teach you. You don't work for me, I won't teach you. I can teach you faster if you work, and I'm wasting my time if you just want to sit and listen, like you do in school. That's my offer. Take it or leave it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，这就是我的建议：由我来教你们赚钱，但我不会像在教室里教学生那样教你们，你们得为我工作，否则我就不教。因为通过工作我可以更快地教会你们，如果你们只想坐着听讲，就像在学校里那样的话，那我就是在浪费时间了。怎么样？小伙子们，这就是我的建议，你们可以接受也可以拒绝”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike's dad, whom I call my rich dad, owned nine of these little superettes with large parking lots. They were the early version of the 7-11 convenience stores. Little neighborhood grocery stores where people bought items such as milk, bread, butter and cigarettes. The problem was, this was Hawaii before air conditioning, and the stores could not close its doors because of the heat. On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the road and parking lot. Every time a car drove by or pulled into the parking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克的爸爸，就是我称为“富爸爸”的那一位，拥有9个这样的小型超市，它们是“7～11”便利店的早期版本，当时除了这些小型超市以外附近几乎没有可以买到牛奶、面包、黄油和香烟的杂货店，所以生意还不错。问题是，这是在空调出现之前的夏威夷，由于炎热，商店不可能关上门。而店的两边有许多停车位，每当一辆车开过或驶进车位，灰尘就漫天扬起飘人店内。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By 9 a. m. on a beautiful Saturday morning, Mike and I were working for Mrs. Martin. She was a kind and patient woman. She always said that Mike and I reminded her of her two sons who were grown and gone. Although kind, she believed in hard work and she kept us working. She was a task master. We spent three hours taking canned goods off the shelves and, with a feather duster, brushing each can to get the dust off, and then re-stacking them neatly. It was excruciatingly boring work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以后从一个美好的星期六早上9点起，迈克和我正式开始给马丁夫人干活了。马丁夫人是一个慈祥而有耐心的女人，她总是说迈克和我使她想起她的两个儿子，她的两个儿子长大后就离开了她。马丁夫人虽然很慈祥，却强调应该努力工作，她让我们不停地干活。她是一个很好的监工，3个小时里，我们不停地把罐装食品从架子上拿下来，用羽毛掸弹去每个罐头上的灰尘，然后重新把它们码放好。这工作真的很乏味。">查看中文翻译</div>
