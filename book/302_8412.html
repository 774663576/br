<div class="line_en">Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of anunpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it, and certainty itself. She now found, that in spite of herself, she hadalways admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that somethingwould occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of hisown, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity ofestablishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all. But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurkingflattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.</div>

<div class="line_en">That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be inorders, and consequently before he could be in possession of theliving, surprised her a little at first. But she soon saw how likelyit was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to securehim, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They weremarried, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle's. Whathad Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华居然这么快就结了婚，没等他（照埃丽诺的想象，当上牧师，因而也没等他）获得牧师俸禄，这在起初使埃丽诺感到有点吃惊。但是她很快领悟到，露西出于深谋远虑，一心只想赶快把他弄到手，除了担心拖延的危险之外，别的事情一概无所顾忌。他们结了婚，在城里结了婚，现在正急着赶到她舅舅家。爱德华来到离巴顿不过四英里的地方，见到了她母亲的男仆，还听到了露西的话，这时他作何感想呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

She saw themin an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance withthe utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices; -- pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of everywealthy friend. In Edward-she knew not what she saw, nor what shewished to see; -- happy or unhappy, -- nothing pleased her; she turned awayher head from every sketch of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in Londonwould write to them to announce the event, and give fartherparticulars, -- but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, notidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found faultwith every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man onhorseback drew her eyes to the window. He stopt at their gate. It wasa gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear more; and she trembled in expectation of it. But-it was NOT ColonelBrandon-neither his air-nor his height. Were it possible, she mustsay it must be Edward. She looked again. He had just dismounted; -- shecould not be mistaken, -- it WAS Edward. She moved away and sat down."He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us. I WILL be calm; I WILLbe mistress of myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺刚想到这里，不料有人骑着马走来，她情不自禁地朝窗外望去。那人在门口停住。他是位绅士，而且就是布兰登上校。现在，她可以听到更多的情况了。期待之中他们大多把“青年马克思”和“老年马克思”对立起来，颂，她不禁颤抖起来。但是——这不是布兰登上校——既不是他的风度，也不是他的身材。如果可能的话，她要说这一定是爱德华。她再一看，他刚刚下马。她不会搞错，──就是爱德华。她离开窗口，坐了下来。“他特地从普赖特家赶来看望我们。我—定要镇静，—定要控制住自己。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them lookat herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.

<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安尽量退到隐蔽的地方，不让别人看见她在伤心。玛格丽特对情况有所了解，但又不全了解，她认为保持尊严是她义不容辞的责任，因此找了个离爱德华尽可能远的地方坐下，一直沉默不语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even forElinor. His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as iffearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one. Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes ofthat daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to beguided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave himher hand, and wished him joy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华进房的时候，神色不太快活，甚至在埃丽诺看来也是如此。他的脸色因为局促不安而变得发白。看样子，他担心受到冷遇，他知道《物理小识》、《通雅》、《东西均》、《易余》、《药地炮庄》、，他不配受到礼遇。可是，达什伍德太太心里一热，还是想—切听从女儿的，于是她自信是遵照女儿的心愿，强作笑颜地迎上前去，把手伸给他，祝他幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and assoon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at firstshe thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked anywhere, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw-or evenheard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quittedthe room, and walked out towards the village-leaving the others in thegreatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, sowonderful and so sudden; -- a perplexity which they had no means oflessening but by their own conjectures.</div>
