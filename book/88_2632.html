<div class="line_en">Rebecca Chambers rode her mountain bike through the dark, winding streets of the Cider district, the late summer moon swelling in the warm, clear night sky overhead. Although it was relatively early, the suburban streets were deserted, the citywide curfew still in effect; no one under eighteen was supposed to be out after dusk until the murderers were caught and put safely behind bars. It had been a tense and quiet summer in Raccoon City, at least on the surface.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been a long, merciless thirteen days since the nightmare at the Spencer estate. The surviving S. T. A. R. S. had escaped treachery and death just to run up against a massive brick wall of scornful disbelief when they'd tried to tell their tale. Jill, Chris, Barry, and herself had been labeled drug addicts and worse in the local papers, undoubtedly at Umbrella's urging -- and after their suspension, even the RPD had refused to believe them. Now, with Umbrella taking over the investigation of the fire, undoubtedly getting rid of the last of the evidence… it was as if everywhere the S. T. A. R. S. turned, Umbrella had been there first, greasing palms and covering tracks, making it impossible to get anyone to listen to their story.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chickenheart Vickers had skipped out of town after only two days, unable to take the pressure -- and although Jill, Chris, and Barry had condemned Brad's cowardice, Rebecca was starting to wonder if maybe the Alpha pilot didn't have the right idea. It wasn't that she wanted Umbrella to walk, there was no question that their experiments were morally reprehensible and certainly illegal -- but until the S. T. A. R.

<div class="line_en">Wherever they were sent, it had to be better than staying in Raccoon. The strain of looking over their shoulders had been getting to all of them.

<div class="line_en">When they'd first made the report, their superiors in New York had told them to stay put. Assistant Director Kurtz himself had promised to do some investigating and get back to them -- but it had been eleven days, and still no word. She had no intention of running away as Brad had done, but she'd come to hate the feeling of that holster, the weight of the deadly steel against her side every waking moment of every day. She was supposed to be a chemist, for chrissake…</div>

<div class="line_en">Since then, she'd spent a lot of time brushing up on the molecular architecture of viruses, trying to determine the T-Virus replication strategy. The S. T. A. R. S. didn't need field medics right now, they needed scientists… and if she'd learned anything from the Spencer estate disaster, it was that she belonged in a lab. She'd held her own that night, but she also knew that working with the T-Virus was the greatest contribution she could make toward stopping Umbrella.</div>

He looked as though he was losing weight, too, though she figured that had more to do with him missing his wife and kids; he'd sent them out of town immediately following the incident, terrified for their safety.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="大卫环视了一圈整个房间，想看看其他人是否做好了面对今后行动的思想准备。巴瑞的两只手都紧紧地握成了拳头，就像是第一次见到那些队友一般盯着他们。吉尔和瑞贝卡则陷入了沉思，似乎对大卫的话深信不移。对两人来说这样的思考方式似乎相对比较能节约时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">David shrugged. "Umbrella has made substantial donations to the S. T. A. R. S. over the years, which means they have the contacts. If they're trying to turn the S. T. A. R. S. away from investigating them, getting rid of Dr. Palmieri would be to their advantage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫耸了耸肩：“这几年安布雷拉给S.T．A.R．S捐了不少钱，因此两者很有可能接触过。如果要让S.T．A.R．S停止继续搜查，罢免帕尔米埃利，对他们明显有很大好处。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">David could see that the anger wasn't directed at him, just as the anger that he felt wasn't for the young Alpha. The thought of what Umbrella had done, what the S. T. A. R. S. were involved in -- it made him sick with rage, with feelings of helplessness that he hadn't felt since his childhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻的Alpha小队成员并不是将愤怒的矛头指向大卫，所以后者也没有对他的这种举动感到生气。安布雷拉的阴谋，S.T．A.R．S的腐败——他是在对这些感到愤怒，而自孩童时代结束后便再也没有入侵过大卫的无力感让他非常不快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You think Umbrella's behind it?" Chris asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这也跟安布雷拉有关吗？”克里斯问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chris stood up and started to pace, his youthful features flushed with anger. "So basically, we've got no credibility with the locals, no backup coming, and we've been branded as liars by our own people. The Umbrella investigation is dead and we're screwed, does that pretty much sum it up?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯已经站了起来，开始在屋子里来回踱步。年轻的面孔被愤怒染得通红。“也就是说，我们不仅失去了当地居民对我们的信任，也不用指望援军，而且还要被盖上叛徒的烙印。对安布雷拉的调查无法再继续，我们被谎言和危险包围。难道这就是所谓的穷途末路？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">David turned to Rebecca, taking in her wide, horrified gaze as he finished. "I'm taking a team in, without S. T. A. R. S. authorization -- and I want you to come with us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到这番话，瑞贝卡由于太过震惊而睁大了眼睛。大卫面向她接着说道：“我在没有得到S.T．A.R．S许可的情况下独自组建了一支小队，瑞贝卡，我希望你能参加。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">David stood up and looked at Chris, though he addressed all of them. He hadn't even had time to tell Barry yet. "Actually, there's more. It seems that there's another Umbrella facility on the Maine coast, conducting experiments with this virus of theirs -- and just like what happened here, they've lost control."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫也站了起来，他看着克里斯，对在座的全体成员开口了。这是他没有事先告知巴瑞的内容：“实际上，这件事还有转机。在缅因州的海岸线某处有一座安布雷拉的设施，那里面好像也在进行某种病毒的实验——而且也和这里一样失去了对那种病毒的控制。”">查看中文翻译</div>
