<div class="line_en">When St John left, it was beginning to snow, and it continued snowing all night and all the next day. In the evening I sat by my fire, listening to the wind blowing outside, and had just started reading when I heard a noise. The wind, I thought, was shaking the door, but no, it was St John, who came in out of the frozen darkness, his coat covered in snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣约翰离开时，天下起雪来，持续了一晚上和第二天一天。晚上，我坐在炉边，听着屋外呼啸的风声。我正要开始看书，突然听到什么响动。我想是风吹动门的声音吧，但不是，是圣约翰。他从寒夜中走进来，身上披满雪花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly he said, "When I arrived I said I wanted to hear the rest of your story. But perhaps it's better if I tell the story. I'm afraid you've heard it before, but listen anyway. Twenty years ago a poor vicar fell in love with a rich man's daughter. She also fell in love with him, and married him, against the advice of all her family. Sadly, less than two years later the couple were both dead. I've seen their grave. Their baby daughter was brought up by an aunt, a Mrs Reed of Gateshead. You jumped -- did you hear a noise? I'll continue. I don't know whether the child was happy with Mrs Reed, but she stayed there ten years, until she went to Lowood school, where you were yourself. In fact, it seems her life was quite similar to yours. She became a teacher at Lowood, as you did, and then became a governess in the house of a certain Mr Rochester."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他说：“我刚才到的时候，说我想听听你另一部分故事，不过也许由我来讲更好。也许你以前听过，但还是再听听吧！二十年前，一个穷牧师爱上了一个富家的女儿，女孩也爱上了他，和他结了婚，违背了家庭的意愿。不幸的是，不到两年，他们便双双去世。我曾见到他们的墓。他们的小女儿由舅妈——盖茨赫德的里德太太抚养长大。你抖了一下，是听到什么动静了吗？我接着说。我不知道孩子跟着里德太太生活得是否幸福，但她在那儿住了十年，直到去洛伍德上学。你也在那儿待过。实际上，她的生活经历似乎和你很像。然后，她成了一位罗切斯特先生家的家庭教师。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's nothing wrong," he answered calmly, hanging up his coat, and stamping the snow from his boots. "I just came to have a little talk to you. Besides, since yesterday I've been eager to hear the other half of your story." He sat down. I had no idea what he was referring to, and remembering his strange behaviour with the piece of paper, I began to fear that he might be going mad. He looked quite normal, however, and we made conversation for a while, although he seemed to be thinking of something else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没出什么事。”他平静地说，一边挂好帽子，并跺掉靴子上的积雪。“我只是要跟你谈谈。另外，从昨天开始，我很想听听你的另外一部分故事。”他坐了下来。我摸不清他指的是什么，想起他昨晚撕纸的奇怪举动，我开始担心他是不是要疯了。但是，他看上去一切正常，我们说了会儿话，不过他显然在想着别的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know nothing about Mr Rochester. Why don't you ask the name of the governess, and why everybody is looking for her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对罗切斯特先生一无所知。你为什么不问问家庭教师的名字，以及为什么大家都在找她？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can imagine how you feel," he replied, "but wait till I've finished. I don't know anything about Mr Rochester's character, but I do know that he offered to marry this young girl, who only discovered during the wedding ceremony that he was in fact already married, to a mad woman. The governess disappeared soon after this, and although investigations have been carried out, and advertisements placed in newspapers, and every effort made to find her, nobody knows where she's gone. But she must be found! Mr Briggs, a lawyer, has something very important to tell her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我能够想像你的感受，”他答道。“不过，还是先听我说完。我不了解罗切斯特先生的性格，但他提出要娶这位年轻姑娘。姑娘是在婚礼上才发现他已经结婚，妻子是个疯女人。此后不久家庭教师很快失踪了。尽管进行了调查，报上登了启事，用尽了一切办法寻找她，还是没人知道她的下落。但是，必须要找到她！律师布莱格斯先生有重要的事要跟她说。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我感到身上发冷，很不高兴。无疑罗切斯特先生又离开英格兰到欧洲的城市去寻欢作乐了，这正是我所担心的。噢，我可怜的主人，差点儿成了我的丈夫，我曾经常称做“我亲爱的爱德华”的人！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rich! One moment I was poor, the next moment I was wealthy. It was hard to realize my new situation. A fortune brings serious worries and responsibilities with it, which I could hardly imagine. I was sorry to hear that my uncle, my only surviving relation, was dead. However, the inheritance would give me independence for life, and I was glad of that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="富有！一时我很穷，一时我又富了。我很难意识到自己的新境遇。一笔财富可以带来我根本无法想像的担忧和责任。听到我唯一活着的亲人我的舅舅去世了，我感到很难过。但是继承遗产可以让我独立生活，这点我很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The advertisements and Briggs spoke of a Jane Eyre, but I only knew a Jane Elliott," said St John. "Are you Jane Eyre?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“布莱格斯先生及启事中提到一个简·爱，但我只认识一个简·艾略特。”圣约翰说。“你是简·爱吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As you won't ask the governess's name, I'll tell you myself," continued St John. "I've got it written down. It's always better to have facts in black and white." And he took out of his wallet a tiny piece of paper, which I recognized as part of my sketch book, and showed it to me. On it I read, in my own writing, "JANE EYRE", which I must have written without thinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“既然你不问家庭教师的名字，我来告诉你。”圣约翰接着说。“我有笔头证据，最好还是白纸黑字清楚些。”他拿出钱包，从里面抽出一张小纸片，拿给我看。我认出那是我速写本上的，上面是我自己的亲笔字“简·爱”，这一定是我无意之中写上去的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My mother's name was Eyre," he said. "She had two brothers, one, a vicar, who married Miss Jane Reed of Gateshead, and the other, John Eyre of Madeira. Mr Briggs, Mr Eyre's lawyer, wrote to us telling us that our uncle had died, and left all his property, not to us, because of his quarrel with our father, but to his brother's daughter. Then Mr Briggs wrote again later, saying this girl could not be found. Well, I've found her." He moved towards the door, his hat in his hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What can you mean? It may mean nothing to you. You already have sisters and don't need any more family. But I had nobody, and now I suddenly have three relations in my world, or two, if you don't want to be counted." I walked rapidly round the room, my thoughts rising so fast I could hardly understand them. The family I now had, the people who had saved me from starvation, I could now help them! There were the four of us cousins. Twenty thousand pounds, shared equally, would be five thousand pounds each, more than enough for each one of us. It would be a fair and just arrangement, and we would all be happy. I would no longer have the worry of controlling a large amount of money, and they would never have to work again. We would all be able to spend more time together at Moor House.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这是什么意思？这可能对你毫无意义。你已经有两个妹妹，不再需要什么亲人了。可是我没有一个亲人，而现在我的世界里却突然有了三个亲人，或许是两个，如果你不愿被称做一个的话。”我在屋里急步踱着，脑子里的念头一个接一个地闪现，我自己都搞不懂了。我现在的亲人，这些曾从饥饿中拯救过我的人，我如今可以帮助他们！我们表兄妹四个，均分 20 000英镑，每人可得5 000英镑，足够用的。这样安排公平合理，我们大家都会感到高兴，我也不必再为掌握着这么多钱而担心，她们也不必再工作了。我们可以有更多的时间一起生活在摩尔屋了。">查看中文翻译</div>
