<div class="line_en">"Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?" Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. "I'm trying to tell you about Snape and Moody…"</div>

<div class="line_en">This class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.</div>

<div class="line_en">He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today -- the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room. Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn't working very well. Neville's aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room -- Professor Flitwick, for instance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在魔咒课上，他、罗恩和赫敏单独坐在教室后面的一张桌子旁。今天他们要练习的咒语和飞来咒正好相反——驱逐咒。因为东西在教室里飞来飞去容易造成不幸事故，弗立维教授给了每个学生一大堆软垫做练习用，这样，即使走偏了，也不会把人砸伤。这个想法倒不错，但执行起来并不顺利。纳威念咒时太没有准头了，他总是不小心把一些很重的东西弄得满屋乱飞——比如弗立维教授。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”罗恩说，眼睛睁得大大的。他的第二个软垫旋转着飞到高空，把枝形吊灯撞得飞了起来，然后重重地落在弗立维的讲台上。“哈利…也许穆迪认为是斯内普把你的名字投进火焰杯的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking… it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he'd loathed Harry's father when they had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她给一个软垫念了驱逐咒，软垫从教室上空飞过，落在他们应该瞄准的箱子里。哈利望着赫敏，沉思着…不错，斯内普以前确实救过他的命，但奇怪的是，斯内普同时又对他恨之入骨，就像当年一起上学时他仇恨哈利的父亲一样。斯内普喜欢给哈利扣分，而且决不错过任何机会惩罚哈利，甚至提出把哈利从学校开除。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I dunno if that's what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he's definitely doing it," said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我也不知道是不是邓布利多叫他去搜查的，但他肯定是这么做了。”哈利说，一边漫不经心地挥了挥魔杖，他的软垫怪模怪样地贴着桌子滑下去了，“穆迪说邓布利多之所以让斯内普留在这里，是为了给他第二次机会…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Snape said Moody's searched his office as well?" Ron whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati's hat off).

<div class="line_en">"Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?" said Hermione, ignoring Ron. "Its a bit funny, isn't it, that he cant manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“克劳奇先生为什么要装病呢？”赫敏不理罗恩，自顾自地说，“他不能来参加圣诞舞会，却能在半夜三更随心所欲地溜到这里来，这真有些蹊跷，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again -- Harry had explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn't see why Harry shouldn't Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy -- it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩倾向于再一次使用飞来咒——哈利跟他们说过水肺的作用，罗恩认为哈利完全可以从附近的麻瓜城镇弄一套水肺过来。赫敏断然否定了这个建议，她指出，即使哈利在规定的一小时内学会了怎样操作水肺（这是不可能的），他也肯定会被取消参赛资格，因为他违反了《国际魔法保密准则》——一套水肺嗖嗖地穿过乡村朝霍格沃茨飞来，要想不被麻瓜看见简直是白日做梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Obedient to Sirius's wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape's office, and Moody and Snape's conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小天狼星希望了解霍格沃茨的每一个异常情况，因此，那天晚上，哈利派一只棕褐色猫头鹰给他送了封信，把克劳奇先生闯进斯内普办公室，以及穆迪和斯内普之间的对话，原原本本地告诉了他。然后，哈利把全部注意力都转向了眼下这个迫在眉睫的问题：2月24日那天，他怎样才能在水下存活一个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something," Hermione said. "If only we'd done human Transfiguration already!

<div class="line_en">So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends -- though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian. Madam Pince, for help -- they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.</div>

<div class="line_en">Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again.

<div class="line_en">Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom… and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Relashio!" Harry shouted, except that no sound came out… A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed.</div>
