<div class="line_en">It was Dairyman Crick's rule to insist on breaking down these partialities and aversions by constant interchange, since otherwise, in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy, he was placed in a difficulty. The maids' private aims, however, were the reverse of the dairyman's rule, the daily selection by each damsel of the eight or ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶牛场老板有一条规矩，就是坚持通过不断地变换人手，来打破奶牛这种偏爱和好恶的习惯；因为不这样做，一且挤奶的男工和女工离开了奶牛场，他就会陷入困难的境地。可是，那些挤奶女工个人的心愿却同奶牛场老板的规矩相反，要是每个姑娘天天都挑她们已经挤习惯了的那八头或十头奶牛，挤它们那些她们已经感到顺手的奶头，她们就会感到特别轻松容易。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In general the cows were milked as they presented themselves, without fancy or choice. But certain cows will show a fondness for a particular pair of hands, sometimes carrying this predilection so far as to refuse to stand at all except to their favourite, the pail of a stranger being unceremoniously kicked over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一般说来，给母牛挤奶是由不得自己选择的，也由不得自己的喜爱，碰上哪一头就挤哪一头。可是某些奶牛却喜欢某个特定人的手，有时候它们的这种偏爱非常强烈，如果不是它们喜欢的人，根本就不站着让你挤奶，还毫不客气地把它们不熟悉的人的牛奶桶踢翻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess, like her compeers, soon discovered which of the cows had a preference for her style of manipulation, and her fingers having become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which she had subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three years, she would have been glad to meet the milchers' views in this respect. Out of the whole ninety-five there were eight in particular -- Dumpling, Fancy, lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty, Tidy, and Loud -- who, though the teats of one or two were as hard as carrots, gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them a mere touch of the fingers. Knowing, however, the dairyman's wish, she endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals 'just as they came, excepting the very hard yielders which she could not yet manage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝同她的伙伴们一样，不久也发现喜欢她的挤奶方式的那几头牛；在最后两三年里，有时候她长时间地呆在家里，一双手的手指头已经变得娇嫩了，因此她倒愿意去迎合那些奶牛的意思。在全场九十五头奶牛中，有八头特别的牛——短胖子、幻想、高贵、雾气、老美人、小美人、整齐、大嗓门——虽然有一两头牛的奶头硬得好像胡萝卜，但是她们大多数都乐意听她的，只要她的手指头一碰奶头，牛奶就流了出来。但是她知道奶牛场老板的意思，所以除了那几头她还对付不了的不容易出奶的牛而外，只要是走到她的身边的奶牛，她都认真地为它们挤奶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“克莱尔先生，是你在安排这些奶牛吧！”她说话的时候，脸上一红；她在责备他的时候，虽然她的上嘴唇仍然紧紧地闭着，但是她又轻轻地张开她的上嘴唇，露出可爱的微笑来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter, till she felt that their order could not be the result of accident.

<div class="line_en">It was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed endowed with two or three senses, if not five. There was no distinction between the near and the far, and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon. The soundlessness impressed her as a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise. It was broken by the strumming of strings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是六月里一个典型的傍晚，大气的平衡达到了精细的程度，传导性也十分敏锐，所以没有生命的东西也似乎有了两三种感觉，如果说没有五种的话。远近的界线消失了，听者感觉到地平线以内的一切都近在咫尺。万籁俱寂，这给她的印象与其说是声音的虚无，不如说是一种实际的存在。这时传来了弹琴声，寂静被打破了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head. Dim, flattened, constrained by their confinement, they had never appealed to her as now, when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that of nudity. To speak absolutely, both instrument and execution were poor, but the relative is all, and as she listened Tess, like a fascinated bird, could not leave the spot. Far from leaving she drew up towards the performer, keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess her presence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝过去听见过头上阁楼里的那些琴声。那时的琴声模糊、低沉、被四周的墙壁挡住了，从来没有像现在那样令她激动，琴声在静静的夜空里荡漾，质朴无华，就像赤裸裸的一样。肯定地说，无论是乐器还是演奏都不出色：不过什么都不是绝对的苔丝听着琴声，就像一只听得入迷的小鸟，离不开那个地方了。她不仅没有离开，而且走到了弹琴人的附近，躲在树篱的后面，免得让他猜出她藏在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The outskirt of the garden in which Tess found herself had been left uncultivated for some years, and was now damp and rank with juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen at a touch; and with tall blooming weeds emitting offensive smells -- weeds whose red and yellow and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers. She went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth, gathering cuckoo-spittle on her skirts, cracking snails that were underfoot, staining her hands with thistlemilk and slug-slime, and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights which, though snow-white on the apple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin; thus she drew quite near to Clare, still unobserved of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝发现她躲藏的地方是在园子的边上，地卜的泥土已经许多年没有耕种了，潮湿的地上现在长满了茂密的多汁的杂草，稍一碰杂草，花粉就化作雾气飞散出来；又高义深的杂草开着花，散发出难闻的气味——野花有红的、黄的和紫的颜色，构成了一幅彩色的图画，鲜艳夺目，就像是被人工培植出来的花草一样。她像一只猫悄悄地走着，穿过这片茂密的杂草，裙子上沾上了杜鹃虫的粘液，脚下踩碎了蜗牛壳，两只手上也沾上了蓟草的浆汁和蛞蝓的粘液，被她擦下来的树霉一样的东西，也沾到了她裸露的手臂上，这种树霉长在苹果树干上像雪一样白，但是沾到她的皮肤上就变成了像茜草染成的斑块；她就这样走到离克莱尔很近的地方，不过克莱尔却看不见她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in the western bank of cloud; it was like a piece of day left behind by accident, dusk having closed in elsewhere. He concluded his plaintive melody, a very simple performance, demanding no great skill; and she waited, thinking another might be begun. But, tired of playing, he had desultorily come round the fence, and was rambling up behind her. Tess, her cheeks on fire, moved away furtively, as if hardly moving at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时仍然透露出来的光线，主要是从西边一大片云彩中的一个大洞中产生生出来的；它仿佛是偶然剩余下来的一片昼，而四周已经被暮色包围了。他弹完了忧郁的旋律，他的弹奏非常简单，也不需要很大的技巧；苔丝在那儿等着，心想第二支曲子也许就要开始了。可是，他已经弹得累了，就漫无目的地绕过树篱，慢慢向她身后走来。苔丝像被火烤了一样满脸通红，好像根本无法移动一步，就悄悄躲在一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess was conscious of neither time nor space. The exaltation which she had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star, came now without any determination of hers; she undulated upon the thin notes of the second-hand harp, and their harmonies passed like breezes through her, bringing tears into her eyes. The floating pollen seemed to be his notes made visible, and the dampness of the garden the weeping of the garden's sensibility. Though near nightfall, the rank-smelling weed-flowers glowed as if they would not close for intentness, and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝已经忘记了时间的运行，忘记厂空间的存在。她过去曾经描述过，通过凝视夜空的星星就能随意生出灵魂出窍的意境，现在她没有刻意追求就出现了；随着那架旧竖琴的纤细的音调，她的心潮起伏波动，和谐的琴音像微风一样．吹进了她的心中，感动得她的眼睛里充满了泪水。那些飘浮的花粉，似乎就是他弹奏出米的可见的音符，花园里一片潮湿，似乎就是花园受到感动流出的泪水。虽然夜晚快要降临了，但是气味难闻的野草的花朵，却光彩夺目，仿佛听得入了迷面不能闭合了，颜色的波浪和琴音的波浪，相互融合在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

She went on peeling the lords and ladies till Clare, regarding for a moment the wave-like curl of her lashes as they drooped with her bent gaze on her soft cheek, lingeringly went away. When he was gone she stood awhile, thoughtfully peeling the last bud; and then, awakening from her reverie, flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility impatiently on the ground, in an ebullition of displeasure with herself for her niaiseries, and with a quickening warmth in her heart of hearts.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Mr Clare,' said the dairyman emphatically, 'is one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowed -- not a bit like the rest of his family; and if there's one thing that he do hate more than another 'tis the notion of what's called a' old family. He says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days, and can't have anything left in 'em now. There's the Billetts and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the St Quintins and the Hardys and the Goulds, who used to own the lands for miles down this valley; you could buy 'em all up now for an old song a'most. Why, our little Retty Priddle here, you know, is one of the Paridelles -- the old family that used to own lots of the lands out by King's-Hintock now owned by the Earl of Wessex, afore even he or his was heard of. Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days. 'Ah!' he says to her, 'you'll never make a good dairymaid! All your skill was used up ages ago in Palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds!' A boy came here t'other day asking for a job, and said his name was Matt, and when we asked him his surname he said he'd never heard that 'a had any surname, and when we asked why, he said he supposed his folks hadn't been established long enough. "Ah! you're the very boy I want!" says Mr Clare, jumping up and shaking hands wi'en; "I've great hopes of you"; and gave him half-a-crown. O no! he can't stomach old families!'</div>

<div class="line_en">After hearing this caricature of Clare's opinions poor Tess was glad that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family -- even though it was so unusually old as almost to have gone round the circle and become a new one. Besides, another dairy-girl was as good as she, it seemed, in that respect. She held her tongue about the d'Urberville vault, and the Knight of the Conqueror whose name she bore. The insight afforded into Clare's character suggested to her that it was largely owing to her supposed untraditional newness that she had won interest in his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的苔丝在听了对克莱尔思想的形容和描述后，暗自庆幸自己没有在软弱的时候对自己的家旅吐露出一个字——虽然她的家族不同寻常地古老，差不多都要转一圈了，又要变成一个新的家族了。另外，还有一个挤奶的姑娘在家世方面似乎和她不相上下。因此，她对德贝维尔家族的墓室，对她出生的那个征服者威廉的骑士家族，都闭口不提。她对克莱尔的性格有了这种了解以后，她猜想她之所以引起他的兴趣，大半是他认为她不是一个古老世家，而是一个新家。">查看中文翻译</div>

And you seem to see numbers of to-morrows just all in a line, the first of them the biggest and clearest, the others getting smaller and smaller as they stand farther away; but they all seem very fierce and cruel and as if they said, "I'm coming! Beware of me! Beware of me!"... But you, sir, can raise up dreams with your music, and drive all such horrid fancies away!'</div>

<div class="line_en">Still, it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so young; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic. Not guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that experience is as to intensity, and not as to duration. Tess's passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，仍然叫人感到奇怪的是，她这样年轻就产生了这样的思想；不仅仅只是奇怪；还叫人感动，叫人关心，叫人悲伤。用不着去猜想其中的缘由，他也想不出来，经验在于阅历的深浅，而不在于时间的长短。从前苔丝在肉体上遭受到痛苦，而现在却是她精神上的收获。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was surprised to find this young woman -- who though but a milkmaid had just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the envied of her housemates -- shaping such sad imaginings. She was expressing in her own native phrases -- assisted a little by her Sixth Standard training -- feelings which might almost have been called those of the age -- the ache of modernism. The perception arrested him less when he reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in great part but the latest fashion in definition -- a more accurate expression, by words in logy and ism, of sensations which men and women have vaguely grasped for centuries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他惊奇地发现这个年轻的女孩子——虽然她不过是一个挤牛奶的女工，却已经有了这种罕有的见解了，这也使得她与其他的同屋女工不同——她竟有了一些如此忧伤的想法。她是用自己家乡的字眼儿表达的——再加上一点儿在标准的六年小学中学到的字眼——她表达的也许差不多是可以被称作我们时代的感情的那种感情，即现代主义的痛苦。他想到，那些所谓的先进思想，大半都是用最时髦的字眼加以定义——使用什么“学”或什么“主义”，那么许多世纪以来男男女女模模糊糊地领会到的感觉，就会被表达得更加清楚了，想到这里，他也就不太注意了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess, on her part, could not understand why a man of clerical family and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a mishap to be alive. For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good reason. But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended into the Valley of Humiliation, have felt with the man of Uz -- as she herself had felt two or three years ago -- 'My soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life. I loathe it; I would not live alway.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在苔丝这一方面，她弄不明白，一个人生在牧师的家庭，受过良好的教育，又没有什么物质上的缺乏，为什么还要把生活看成足一种不幸。对她这样一个苦命的朝圣者来说，这样想自有充足的理由，可是他那样一个让人羡慕和富有诗意的人，怎么会掉进耻屏谷①中呢，怎么也会有乌兹老人②一样的感情呢——他的感觉就同她两三年前的感觉一样——“我宁愿上吊，宁愿死去，也不愿活着。我厌恶生命，我不愿意永远活着。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was true that he was at present out of his class. But she knew that was only because, like Peter the Great in a shipwright's yard, he was studying what he wanted to know. He did not milk cows because he was obliged to milk cows, but because he was learning how to be a rich and prosperous dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder of cattle. He would become an American or Australian Abraham, commanding like a monarch his flocks and his herds, his spotted and his ring-stroked, his men-servants and his maids. At times, nevertheless, it did seem unaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish, musical, thinking young man should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer, and not a clergyman, like his father and brothers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确，他现在已经离开学校了。但是苔丝知道，那只是因为他要学习他想学习的东西，就像彼得大帝到造船厂里去学习一样。他要挤牛奶并不是因为他非要挤牛奶不可，而是因为他要学会怎样做一个富有的、兴旺发达的奶牛场老板、地主、农业家和畜牧家。他要做一个美同或澳大利亚的亚伯拉罕③，就像一个国王一样统管着他的羊群和牛群，或是长有斑点或斑纹的羊群和牛群，还有大量的男女仆人。不过有的时候，似乎她也难以理解，他这样一个书生气十足、爱好音乐和善于思索的年轻人，为自己选择的竟是做一个农民，而不是像他的父亲和哥哥一样去当牧师。">查看中文翻译</div>
