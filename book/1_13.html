<div class="line_en">A couple of hours later Joanna arrived at Sophie's door with a large backpack. Sophie had packed hers as well, and she also had the tent. They both had bedrolls and sweaters, groundsheets and flashlights, large-size thermos bottles and plenty of their favorite food.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“也许我们可以找到钥匙。”苏菲说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Sophie had thought of that. She took a box of matches out of her pocket and struck one. They only had time to see that the cabin was deserted before the match went out. Sophie struck another, and this time she noticed a stump of candle in a wrought-iron candlestick on top of the stove. She lit it with the third match and the little room became light enough for them to look around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，苏菲是有备而来。她从口袋里拿出了一盒火柴擦亮一根。在火光熄灭之前的那一刹那，她们看清楚小屋内空无一人。苏菲擦亮另一根火柴，这次她注意到炉子上有一座锻铁做的烛台，上面有半截蜡烛。她用第三根火柴把蜡烛点亮，于是小屋里才有了一点光线，让她们可以看清四周。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">P. S. Some day you will meet a girl called Sophie. To give you both a chance to get to know more about each other before you meet, I have begun sending her copies of all the cards I send to you. I expect she will soon begin to catch on, Hilde. As yet she knows no more than you. She has a girlfriend called Joanna. Maybe site can be of help?</div>

<div class="line_en">When they got outside it was as dark as a May night can get. There was enough light in the sky for the clear outlines of bushes and trees to be visible. The small lake lay like a reflection of the sky above it. The two girls rowed pensively across to the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她们走出木屋时，天色就像寻常五月的夜晚一样黑。天边仍有一些光线，因此她们可以很清楚地看到灌木与树林的轮廓。小湖静静躺着，仿佛是天空的倒影。划向彼岸时，两个人都心事重重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as they reached the tent, they crawled into their bedrolls. Joanna refused to have the mirror inside the tent. Before they fell asleep, they agreed that it was scary enough, knowing it was just outside the tent flap. Sophie had also taken the postcards and put them in one of the pockets of her backpack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们一到帐篷就爬进睡袋中。乔安不肯把镜子放在帐篷里。入睡前，两人一致认为那面镜子是满可怕的，虽然它只是放在帐篷入口。苏菲今天也拿走了那些明信片，她把它们放在登山背包的口袋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they approached the outskirts of the town they heard a few sporadic shots. Sophie recalled what Hilde's father had written about war-torn Lebanon, and she realized how lucky she was to have been born in a peaceful country. The "shots" they heard came from innocent fireworks celebrating the national holiday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们快走到市郊时，听到间歇的枪声。苏菲想起席德的父亲提到的那备受战火摧残的黎巴嫩。她突然发现自己是多么幸运，能够生在一个和平的国家。后来，她才发现那些“枪声”原来是有人放烟火庆祝仲夏节的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie invited Joanna in for a cup of hot chocolate. Her mother was very curious to know where they had found the mirror. Sophie told her they had found it outside the major's cabin, and her mother repeated the story about nobody having lived there for many years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到家后，苏菲邀请乔安进屋里喝一杯热巧克力。苏菲的妈妈很好奇她们是在哪里发现那面镜子的，苏菲说他们是在少校的木屋外面捡到的，妈妈于是又说了一遍那里已有许多年无人居住等等的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last thing Sophie did on May 17 was to hang the large mirror on the wall in her room. The following morning there was a new brown envelope in the den. She tore it open at once and began to read.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Joanna had gone, Sophie put on a red dress. The rest of the Norwegian national day passed quite normally. In the evening, the TV news had a feature on how the Norwegian UN battalion had celebrated the day in Lebanon. Sophie's eyes were glued to the screen. One of the men she was seeing could be Hilde's father.</div>
