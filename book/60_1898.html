<div class="line_en">He was the timepiece of their lives. In periods of despair, she would remind herself she had to hold on because of him, because he was weaker than she, weaker perhaps even than Dubcek and their abandoned homeland.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nonetheless, he soon managed to reestablish the old order and old rituals in the Zurich flat. As in Prague, he would jump up on their bed and welcome them to the day, accompany Tereza on her morning shopping jaunt, and make certain he got the other walks coming to him as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，卡列宁很快就在苏黎世的屋子里恢复了老时间表和老习惯。早晨，和在布拉格时一样，它都跳上床去和他们相聚，开始新的一天，然后跟特蕾莎一早出门去跑步。和在布拉格时一样，它非要每天都出去遛遛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Karenin was not overjoyed by the move to Switzerland. Karenin hated change. Dog time cannot be plotted along a straight line; it does not move on and on, from one thing to the next. It moves in a circle like the hands of a clock, which -- they, too, unwilling to dash madly ahead -- turn round and round the face, day in and day out following the same path. In Prague, when Tomas and Tereza bought a new chair or moved a flower pot, Karenin would look on in displeasure. It disturbed his sense of time. It was as though they were trying to dupe the hands of the clock by changing the numbers on its face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡列宁才不乐意去瑞士呢。卡列宁讨厌变动。对于一只狗来说，时间运动不是直线式完成的，它的流逝并不是一种不断向前的运动，不是一步一步向远方推进，而是循环运动，就像手表的指针，因为指针非但不是疯一样地只顾往前走，而是在表盘上日复一日，沿着同样的轨迹转圈。在布拉格，他们买张新沙发椅，或者给花盆挪个地方，卡列宁都会生气，因为它的时间感被搅乱了。要是有人在表盘上不断变动数字，指针也会乱了阵脚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day when they came back from a walk, the phone was ringing. She picked up the receiver and asked who it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，散完步回到家，电话响了。她拿起听筒，问是哪位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a woman's voice speaking German and asking for Tomas. It was an impatient voice, and Tereza felt there was a hint of derision in it. When she said that Tomas wasn't there and she didn't know when he'd be back, the woman on the other end of the line started laughing and, without saying good-bye, hung up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是一个女人的声音，讲德语，找托马斯。声音很不耐烦，特蕾莎相信那声音中透出股轻蔑的意味。她说托马斯出去了，不知道什么时候回来，女人在电话线的另一端哈的一声笑，然后没说再见就挂断了电话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tereza knew it did not mean a thing. It could have been a nurse from the hospital, a patient, a secretary, anyone. But still she was upset and unable to concentrate on anything. It was then that she realized she had lost the last bit of strength she had had at home: she was absolutely incapable of tolerating this absolutely insignificant incident.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎知道不必把这件事放在心上。可能是医院的一个护士，一个病人，一位秘书，管她是谁。但她的心乱了，她怎么也无法集中精力。她明白她连在布拉格拥有的那一点点力量也失去了，即使这样一件微不足道的小事，她也绝对无法承受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Being in a foreign country means walking a tightrope high above the ground without the net afforded a person by the country where he has his family, colleagues, and friends, and where he can easily say what he has to say in a language he has known from childhood. In Prague she was dependent on Tomas only when it came to the heart; here she was dependent on him for everything. What would happen to her here if he abandoned her? Would she have to live her whole life in fear of losing him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个人生活在异国，就像在空中行走，脚下没有任何保护，而在自己的国家，不管什么人，都有祖国这张保护网，一切都颇具人情味，因为，在祖国，有自己的家人、同事、朋友，可以用童年时就熟悉的语言毫不费力地让人理解。在布拉格，她依靠托马斯，的确如此，但那只是在心里。在这里，她的一切都得依靠他。如果他把她抛弃了，她在这里会怎样？难道她必须在生怕失去他的恐惧中度过一生？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave.</div>

<div class="line_en">The copy of Anna Karenina under her arm amounted to false papers; it had given Tomas the wrong idea. In spite of their love, they had made each other's life a hell. The fact that they loved each other was merely proof that the fault lay not in themselves, in their behavior or inconstancy of feeling, but rather in their incompatibility: he was strong and she was weak. She was like Dubcek, who made a thirty-second pause in the middle of a sentence; she was like her country, which stuttered, gasped for breath, could not speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天她夹着本《安娜·卡列宁娜》，那只是她用来欺骗托马斯的假身份证。他们为彼此造了一座地狱，尽管他们彼此相爱。的确，他们彼此相爱，这足以证明错不在他们本身，不在他们的行为，也不在他们易变的情绪，错在他们之间的不可调和性，因为他强大，而她却是软弱的。她就像杜布切克，一句话有半分钟的停顿，就像她的祖国，结结巴巴，喘不过气，说不出话来。">查看中文翻译</div>
