<div class="line_en">MY POOR DEAREST LOVE, -- I could not sleep at all last night because of worrying over what had happened to you. In the morning I felt so ill that I sent for the doctor, who gave me some medicine to help me sleep, and said I must not be disturbed. So your messenger spent hours waiting. You can imagine how I felt when I finally read your letter. I got ready at once to go out, but then Lord Steyne arrived with some friends (they were so full of compliments about last night!).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可怜的、最最亲爱的：我昨晚整夜睡不着觉，担心你出了什么事。早晨我病得很严重，只得请了医生来。他给我开了帮助睡眠的药，说我绝不能受打扰。因此，你的信差等了好几个小 时。你能想象得到，后来我终于看到你的信时是怎样的感受啊。我立刻准备好出门，不料斯泰恩勋爵带着他的朋友们来了（他们对昨晚赞不绝口呢！）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was desperate for them to go and when at last they did, I went down on my knees to Lord Steyne and begged him to give me two hundred pounds. He was in a great fury -- but finally he went away, promising to send me the money in the morning, when I will bring it at once to my poor old prisoner -- with a kiss from his affectionate Becky. (P. S. I am writing in bed. Oh, I have such a headache, and such a heartache!)</div>

<div class="line_en">When Rawdon read this letter, his face turned red with anger, and all his suspicions returned. She could not even go out and sell a few things to free him. She could talk about compliments paid to her while he was in prison. Who had put him there? He could hardly bear to think of what he suspected. Quickly, he sat down and wrote a short note to Sir Pitt or Lady Crawley. He begged them to help him, for the sake of his child.</div>

Lights shone brightly from the drawing-room windows. She had said that she was in bed and ill. He stood there for some time, the light from the rooms on his pale face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="债务很快就还清了。坐马车回家的路上，罗顿再三感谢简女士。晚上九点钟，他把简女士送到家后，一路上连走带跑，上气不接下气地跑到自己家门前。他停下脚步，抬头看着房子，浑身颤抖。客厅窗户透出明亮的灯光。她之前说她生病卧床。他站了好一会儿，房子里透出的灯光照在他苍白的脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took out his door key, let himself into the house, and went silently up the stairs. Everywhere was quiet; all the servants had been sent away.

<div class="line_cn" title="他取出家门钥匙，开门进屋，悄悄上楼。四处一片安静，仆人们都被打发走了。他听到客厅传来笑声——笑声和歌声。贝姬在唱歌。一个声音大喊：“唱得好！唱得好！”说话人是斯泰恩勋爵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rawdon opened the door and went in. There was a little table with dinner for two -- and wine. Lord Steyne was leaning over the sofa on which Becky was sitting. She wore her finest evening dress, and around her neck sparkled the diamonds which Steyne had given her. He had her hand in his, and was bowing over it to kiss it, when Becky jumped up with a faint scream as she caught sight of Rawdon's white face. She tried to smile, and Steyne stood up, pale, and with fury in his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗顿打开门，走了进去。一张小桌子上摆着两人的晚餐，还有葡萄酒。贝姬坐在沙发上，斯泰恩勋爵俯身向她靠去。她穿着她最漂亮的晚礼服，脖子上斯泰恩勋爵送给她的钻石项链闪闪发光。他拉着她的手，正要低头亲吻上去。就在这时，贝姬看见罗顿惨白的脸，发出一声微弱的惊叫，吓得跳了起来。她努力挤出笑脸，而斯泰恩勋爵站起身，铁青着脸，怒形于色。">查看中文翻译</div>

She walked quickly through the streets (she had no money to pay for a carriage) to Sir Pitt's house in Great Gaunt Street. Where was Lady Jane Crawley? It was Sunday, she was at church. And Sir Pitt? In his study. Becky slipped past the servant and was in Sir Pitt's room before her astonished brother-in-law had even laid down his newspaper.</div>

The thousand-pound note was sent back to Lord Steyne, and after long, hard persuasion from his friends, Rawdon finally agreed to accept the position of Governor of Coventry Island.
