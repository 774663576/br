His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了很长时间，也许根本没有时间，他意识到自己肯定存在，肯定不只是脱离了肉体的思绪，因为他躺在，绝对是躺在，某个东西的表面。因此他是有触觉的，而他身下的那个东西也是存在的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes.</div>

It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一种声音，从周围未成形的虚无中传到了他的耳朵里：某个东西不断拍打、摆动和挣扎发出的细小的撞击声。这声音令人心生怜悯，同时又有些猥琐。他有一种很不舒服的感觉，似乎在偷听什么隐秘而可耻的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace.

<div class="line_en">He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises.

Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster's face.

<div class="line_en">"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child.

I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right.
