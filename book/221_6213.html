<div class="line_cn" title="“这是配楼。过去用做训练房，后来我们觉得这里比主屋对威尔更方便些，因为它全在一层。这是一个闲置的房间，必要时内森会在这里过夜。早些时候我们常需要人帮忙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

There was an open wet area under the shower, with a folded wheelchair beside it. In the corner a glass-fronted cabinet revealed neat stacks of shrink-wrapped bales. I couldn't see what they were from here, but it all gave off a faint scent of disinfectant.</div>

<div class="line_en">I felt myself brightening. If he liked music and films, surely we could find some common ground? I had a sudden picture of myself and this man laughing at some Hollywood comedy, me running the Hoover around the bedroom while he listened to his music. Perhaps this was going to be okay. Perhaps we might end up as friends. I had never had a disabled friend before -- only Treen's friend David, who was deaf, but would put you in a headlock if you suggested that meant disabled.</div>

A solidly built man in white collarless scrubs was crouching down, adjusting a man's feet on the footrests of the wheelchair. As we stepped into the room, the man in the wheelchair looked up from under shaggy, unkempt hair. His eyes met mine and after a pause, he let out a bloodcurdling groan. Then his mouth twisted, and he let out another unearthly cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间正中放着一把黑色轮椅，坐椅和靠背铺着羊皮垫。一个身穿白色无领防护衣的强壮男人正蹲下身在轮椅的搁脚板上挪动着另一个男人的脚。我们走进房间时，坐在轮椅上的那个男人抬起头来，他的头发蓬乱不堪，他的目光与我的相遇，他沉默了片刻，发出一声令人毛骨悚然的呻吟。接着他的嘴扭动了一下，又发出一声怪叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't even glance towards her. Another prehistoric sound emerged from somewhere near his chest. It was a terrible, agonizing noise. I tried not to flinch.

These he needs fairly often to control his muscular spasms -- you will need to give him one mid-morning, and again at mid-afternoon. He doesn't find those too hard to swallow, because they're the little coated ones. These are for bladder spasms, and these here are for acid reflux. He sometimes needs these after eating if he gets uncomfortable. This is his antihistamine for the morning, and these are his nasal sprays, but I mostly do those last thing before I leave, so you shouldn't have to worry. He can have paracetamol if he's in pain, and he does have the odd sleeping pill, but these tend to make him more irritable in the daytime, so we try to restrict them.</div>

<div class="line_en">There he was on a ski slope, beside a girl with dark glasses and long blonde hair. I stooped, to get a better view of him in his ski goggles. He was clean-shaven in the photograph, and even in the bright light his face had that expensive sheen to it that moneyed people get through going on holiday three times a year. He had broad, muscular shoulders visible even through his ski jacket. I put the photograph carefully back on the table and continued to vacuum around the back of the bed. Finally, I turned the vacuum cleaner off, and began to wind the cord up. As I reached down to unplug it, I caught a movement in the corner of my eye and jumped, letting out a small shriek. Will Traynor was in the doorway, watching me.</div>
