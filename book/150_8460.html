<div class="line_en">As the ship steamed into Marseilles, Kitty, looking at the rugged and beautiful outline of the coast glowing in the sunlight, on a sudden caught sight of the golden statue of the Blessed Virgin which stands upon the church of Sainte Marie de la Grace as a symbol of safety to the mariner at sea. She remembered how the Sisters of the convent at Mei-Tan-fu, leaving their own land for ever, had knelt as the figure faded in the distance so that it was no more than a little golden flame in the blue sky and sought in prayer to allay the pang of separation. She clasped her hands in supplication to what power she knew not.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the long, quiet journey she had thought incessantly of the horrible thing that had happened to her. She could not understand herself. It was so unexpected. What was it that had seized her, so that, despising him, despising him with all her heart, she had yielded passionately to Charlie's foul embrace? Rage tilled her and disgust of herself obsessed her. She felt that she could never forget her humiliation. She wept. But as the distance from Hong Kong increased she found that she was insensibly losing the vividness of her resentment. What had happened seemed to have happened in another world. She was like a person who has been stricken with sudden madness and recovering is distressed and ashamed at the grotesque things he vaguely remembers to have done when he was not himself. But besause he knows he was not himself he feels that in his own eyes at least he can claim indulgence. Kitty thought that perhaps a generous heart might pity rather than condemn her. But she sighed as she thought how woefully her self-confidence had been shattered. The way had seemed to stretch before her straight and easy and now she saw that it was a tortuous way and that pitfalls awaited her. The vast spaces and the tragic and beautiful sunsets of the Indian Ocean rested her. She seemed borne then to some country where she might in freedom possess her soul. If she could only regain her self-respect at the cost of a bitter conflict, well, she must find the courage to affront it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="漫长而又平静的旅途中，她不止一遍地回忆着发生在她身上的那件可怕之事。她无法理解自己，她的所作所为完全出乎她的意料。到底是什么慑住了她，使她即便彻头彻尾地鄙视查理却还是投入了他龌龊的怀抱？怒火在她的胸口燃烧，厌恶感撕扯着她的心。她觉得这辈子也不会忘了这次羞耻。她不住地落泪。然而随着船离香港越来越远，她发觉心中的怨恨之情渐渐地迟钝了下来。那件事好像是发生在另一个世界，她好比是个猛然发了疯病的人，清醒之后为她依稀记得的疯病发作时的所作所为感到哀伤和羞愧。但既然那不是真正的自己，所以还是有机会请求人们的原谅。凯蒂相信一个宽宏大量的人应该会怜悯她而不是责备她。然而想到她的自信心因此悲哀地化为乌有，她又不禁唉声叹气。她的面前曾经展开了一条笔直的康庄大道，而现在她明白那仅仅是条曲折崎岖、陷阱遍布的小路。印度洋上广阔的洋面和凄美的日落使她的心松弛了下来。她似乎来到了另一个国度，在这里她可以自由地控制自己的灵魂。如果非要经过斗争才能找回她的自尊，那好，她就提起勇气来面对吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The future was lonely and difficult. At Port Said she had received a letter from her mother in answer to her cable. It was a long letter written in the large and fanciful writing which was taught to young ladies in her mother's youth. Its ornateness was so neat that it gave you an impression of insincerity. Mrs. Garstin expressed her regret at Walter's death and sympathized properly with her daughter's grief. She feared that Kitty was left inadequately provided for, but naturally the Colonial Office would give her a pension. She was glad to know that Kitty was coming back to England and of course she must come and stay with her father and mother till her child was born. Then followed certain instructions that Kitty must be sure to follow and various details of her sister Doris's confinement. The little boy weighed so and so much and his paternal grandfather said he had never seen a finer child. Doris was expecting again and they hoped for another boy in order to make the succession to the baronetcy quite sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="未来的日子将是孤独而艰难的。船到塞得港时她收到了母亲给她电报的回信。信很长，是用大号的花体字精心誊写而成，这一书法才能是每位母亲年轻时务必传授给女儿的。不过信中言辞之华丽，措辞之讲究，使人不免对写信人的真心诚意产生疑虑。贾斯汀夫人对瓦尔特的去世表达了深痛的哀悼，对女儿的哀伤之情深表同情。她忧心凯蒂的衣食日用从此没了着落，不过殖民地当局不会忘了给她派送抚恤金的。她异常高兴地得知凯蒂即将回到英格兰与父母团聚，并要求她理应在他们的寓所住下，一直待到孩子出生。之后是对凯蒂孕期所须注意的谆谆教诲，以及对她妹妹多丽丝的分娩经过不厌其烦的描述。多丽丝的儿子生下来又胖又重，他的祖父断言这是他见过的最为出色的宝贝儿。多丽丝如今又怀孕了，全家人希望再添一个男孩，好让准男爵的爵位万无一失地传承下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty saw that the point of the letter lay in the definite date set for the invitation. Mrs. Garstin had no intention of being saddled with a widowed daughter in modest circumstances. It was singular, when she reflected how her mother had idolized her, that now, disappointed in her, she found her merely a nuisance. How strange was the relation between parents and children! When they were small the parents doted on them, passed through agonies of apprehension at each childish ailment, and the children clung to their parents with love and adoration; a few years passed, the children grew up, and persons not of their kin were more important to their happiness than father or mother. Indifference displaced the blind and instinctive love of the past. Their meetings were a source of boredom and irritation. Distracted once at the thought of a month's separation they were able now to look forward with equanimity to being parted for years. Her mother need not worry: as soon as she could she would make herself a home of her own. But she must have a little time; at present everything was vague and she could not form any picture of the future: perhaps she would die in childbirth; that would be a solution of many difficulties.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂看出信的主旨是向她发出那个早晚也得发出的邀请。贾斯汀夫人绝不会真心实意地叫一个寡妇女儿来拖累自己。她曾经对凯蒂倾注了无数的心血，而今既然已对她大失所望，这个女儿就只是个累赘了。父母与孩子之间的关系是多么奇怪！孩子年幼时是父母掌心里的宝贝，任何小病小恙都会让他们忧心如焚。这时孩子们对父母也是崇敬热爱，依赖有加。几年之后，孩子们长大了，跟他们毫无血脉关系的人取代了父母，成了带给他们幸福的人。冷漠代替了过去盲目而本能的爱，连彼此见面也成了烦躁与恼怒的来源。一度曾经十天半月不见便会朝思暮想，如今即便是成年累月不见他们也乐得享受清闲。她的母亲不必忧心地算计，凯蒂会尽快找个住处安顿下来。不过怎么也得耽搁点时间，现在什么事还都没个头绪。有可能她生产的时候就会难产死掉了，那倒是个快刀斩乱麻的办法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when they docked two letters were handed to her. She was surprised to recognize her father's writing: she did not remember that he had ever written to her. He was not effusive, and began: Dear Kitty. He told her that he was writing instead of her mother who had not been well and was obliged to go into a nursing home to have an operation. Kitty was not to be frightened and was to keep to her intention of going round by sea; it was much more expensive to come across by land and with her mother away it would be inconvenient for Kitty to stay at the house in Harrington Gardens. The other was from Doris and it started: Kitty darling, not because Doris had any particular affection for her, but because it was her way thus to address every one she knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船再次靠岸之后她又收到了两封信。她惊奇地发现那是她父亲的笔迹，她记得父亲还从未给她写过信。他的口吻倒不是亲切异常，只以“亲爱的凯蒂”开头。他说他现在是为她的妈妈代笔，因为后者身体不适，已经被强行送进医院接受手术。凯蒂并没有感到吃惊，依然按照原来的打算继续从海路上走。一来从陆路走虽然快但是价钱太贵，二来如果她回到了家而母亲还没有被送回来，她打理起哈林顿花园的事儿就会有诸多不便。另一封信是多丽丝发来的，开头便是：凯蒂宝贝。倒不是她对凯蒂的情意有多深厚，而是对哪个认识的人她都是这么称呼的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I expect Father has written to you. Mother has got to have an operation. It appears that she has been rotten for the last year, but you know she hates doctors and she's been taking all sorts of patent medicines. I don't quite know what's the matter with her as she insists on making a secret of the whole thing and flies into a passion if you ask her questions. She has been looking simply awful and if I were you I think I'd get off at Marseilles and come back as quick as you can. But don't let on that I told you to come as she pretends there's nothing much the matter with her and she doesn't want you to get here till she's back at home. She's made the doctors promise that she shall be moved in a week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想父亲已经写信给你。妈妈必须接受一次手术，好像她从去年就已经不舒服了，不过你知道她这个人讳疾忌医。官药偏方她都自己试，可我不知道她到底是得的什么病，她也始终闭口不提，要是追问起来，她还会一跳而起。她的情况看起来糟极了，如果我是你，就会立即从马赛动身，尽早地赶回来。但请不要把我说的情况向她透露，她还假装自己没有大碍，不想让你回来却见她不在。她已经逼医生发誓说一个礼拜后就把她送回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
