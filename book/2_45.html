<div class="line_en">I went up to my new lab mate and introduced myself. He looked at me as though I weren't there. I felt he treated me as though I would hold him back and probably cause his grade-point average to take a nosedive. He wasn't outright mean or abusive. He just gave me the impression he could do whatever project we dreamed up better if he did it alone. He was a loner, and I could only impede his research. He had important things to do, and I was going to be something of an annoyance he'd have to deal with.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Dr. Gullickson was assigning project mates for his introduction to experimental psychology class, I secretly hoped he would pair me with a cute coed or at least a classmate I could have some fun with. Above all, I hoped he wouldn't assign me to work with the intense, fiercely competitive, singularly serious fellow who always wore dark clothes and apparently had a personality to match. As fate would have it, Dr. Gullickson very deliberately matched everyone in class and announced that I would be working with the one person in class I wanted to avoid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当格利克森博士正在为实验心理学课分配研究小组时，我暗暗地祈祷他能把我与一个可爱的女生，至少是一个志趣相投的同学分在一组。总而言之，我希望他不要让我与一个竞争意识强烈、异常严肃的家伙做搭档，这种人总爱穿深色的衣服，而且还有着十足的个性。命运弄人，格利克森博士在一番深思熟虑后，向每个人宣布了结果，而我与一个我最想躲避的人成为一组。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Needless to say, I didn't look forward to an entire semester of being brushed off, but I tried to make the best of it and didn't say anything, lest I make things worse.</div>

<div class="line_en">The project required each lab team to develop a hypothesis, set up an experiment to test the hypothesis, run the tests, do the statistical analysis and present the findings. Whatever grade the team received would be shared by both students. When my lab mate and I met to discuss our project, I was uneasy. Here was this challenging student who had a reputation for single-mindedness and good grades -- the exact opposite of me. 1 was outmatched. I actually wanted to drop the class at one point, but stopped short because I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of my chickening out. I asked my friends at work what I should do, and the overall response was to stick it out no matter what.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="根据计划，每个实验小组要提出假设、制定实验检验假设、进行统计学分析、介绍研究结果。小组取得的成绩就是每个小组成员的成绩。我每次都忐忑不安地与同伴讨论实验的问题。他在这里是出了名的专注和优秀，他是一个勇于挑战的人——而我与他完全相反。事实上，我心里曾经有过放弃的念头，然而，我不想被他看扁，所以很快放弃了这种想法。我向那些忙于工作的朋友请教我该怎么做，他们的回答全部是，无论发生什么，坚持到底。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After lengthy discussions, we somehow agreed to do a study on the tactile-kinesthetic perception of space. I wasn't sure what it meant, but at least we had a topic. We started to meet regularly to formulate our plans, and every time I felt the project was more his than mine. The more we met, the more I resented his intelligence and his ability to cut through to the core issues. And I was aware he was much more advanced than I. He knew technical things and approached every detail with great singularity of purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过长时间的讨论后，我们终于达成一致，决定做一项关于空间触觉和动觉感知的研究。我并不明白这是一项什么研究，但至少我们确定了一个题目。为了制定计划，我们定期碰面，每次讨论决定之后，我都觉得是他制定了计划。我们碰面的次数越多，我就越是痛恨他的才智和直击问题核心的能力。我逐渐意识到，他的水平比我高很多。他了解技术，并且能带着明确的目标去处理每一个细节问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I, on the other hand, must have seemed naive, with little to offer. At one point I summoned up my courage and asked him why he seemed so uptight and serious. To my surprise, he replied that he didn't have time for small talk or petty people and things that would waste his time. He even went on to say that he didn't have many friends because most so-called friends were just a distraction. But, he added, when he did choose someone to be his friend, they would be a friend for life. I was floored by his cold and cynical response. Right then and there, I realized the end of the semester couldn't come soon enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一方面，我能提出的建议微乎其微，有时看起来的确天真。有一次，我鼓起勇气问他，他为什么看起来那么紧张严肃。令我吃惊的是，他回答我说他没时间闲聊，对他来说，无聊的人和事只是浪费时间。他甚至还说，他没有很多朋友，因为那些所谓的朋友只会令人分心。不过，他补充道，一旦他选择某人作为自己的朋友，他就会把他们当作一生的朋友。他那冷淡和玩世不恭的态度让我十分震惊。就在那时，我恨不得这个学期马上结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the semester wore on, we tried to fashion a simple yet elegant experiment. Part of our job was to select students who had volunteered to be subjects for our project. I decided to devote myself to the task of working with the subjects, while he developed the scientific model. I put in my two cents' worth whenever I could, but I still felt he was the driving force.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时光荏苒，我们尝试设计了一个操作简单且非常出色的实验。挑选自愿做实验对象的学生成了我们的一部分工作，我决定致力于招募研究对象，而他负责阐述科学方法。我抓住一切可能的机会陈述自己的意见，然而，我仍然有一种感觉：他才是整个实验的驱动力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then one day I got word that he was in hospital. Apparently, he had been admitted for a hemorrhaging ulcer. The stress of getting the best grades, holding down a job and helping his girlfriend through the medical crisis she was going through had taken its toll on him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来有一天，我得知他生病住进了医院。很显然，他是因为出血性溃疡才住院的。他想取得最好的成绩，想找一份工作，想帮助生病的女朋友度过危险期，这些压力把他压垮了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I visited him in the hospital, I noticed for the first time a sense of vulnerability on the face of my stoic lab mate. I knew that he was aware that I could blow the experiment, and our shared grade would shatter his lofty G. P. A. and possibly derail his chances for graduate school. I assured him I would not let him down and he should only concentrate on ③ getting better. I would do my best. We both knew I'd have to do better than my best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我到医院探望他时，我第一次注意到，这个坚忍克己的实验伙伴的脸上有了一种脆弱的表情。我知道，他是担心我会把实验搞砸，担心他的总平均成绩被小组实验成绩毁掉，甚至会突然失去进研究院的机会。我向他保证，我一定会付出最大的努力不让他失望，让他一心一意恢复健康。我们都清楚，我必须比最好做得还要好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had a formidable task ahead of me. I was in over my head, running the statistical data. I poured more time and energy into that project than I had ever done on any assignment in my life. I was not going to let him see me fail and have it reflect on him. I was working the graveyard shift at my job, so I used whatever quiet time from midnight to 6:00 A. M. to work on the project. The work consumed me. There was a sense of challenge that completely overtook me. The question remained: Was I up to it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="任务十分艰巨。我埋头整理统计数据，这些资料已经超出了我的理解范围。我有生以来所做的任何作业，都不曾付出过这么多的时间和精力。我不能让他看到我失败，不愿意因为我而影响他的成绩。为了能安静地做研究，我把工作时间调整到夜里，从午夜一直干到凌晨六点。我被工作吸引住了，感觉自己全身心地投入到了一场挑战之中。但问题仍然存在，我能解决吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eventually, the semester came to a close, and each team had to present its findings in front of the assembled class. When it was our turn, I did my level best to present his scientific methodology with my showmanship. To my amazement, we were awarded an A!</div>
