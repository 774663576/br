<div class="line_en">On a Saturday evening in late September, about three weeks before the Journal published my first story, an email arrived in the in-box of Gary Yamamoto, the veteran CMS field inspector who had dropped in unannounced at the old Facebook building in 2012 and lectured Sunny Balwani about lab regulations. Under the subject line "CMS Complaint: Theranos Inc.," it began:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九月底一个周六晚上，大约是《华尔街日报》刊出我第一篇报导的三周前，一封电邮寄到盖瑞．山本的信箱（山本就是二〇一二年到脸书旧址突击稽查Theranos，并且搬出实验室法规告诫桑尼．包汪尼的资深CMS稽查员），信件主旨栏写着「投诉Theranos公司」，开头是这样：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I've been nervous to send or even write this letter. Theranos takes confidentiality and secrecy to an extreme level that has always made me scared to say anything… I'm ashamed in myself for not filing this complaint sooner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寄这封信，甚至光是写这封信就让我紧张不已。Theranos把机密和保密这件事做到极致程度，所以我什么都不敢说…我很惭愧没有早一点提出投诉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The email was from Erika Cheung and it contained a series of allegations, ranging from scientific misconduct to sloppy lab practices. It also said that Theranos's proprietary devices were unreliable, that the company cheated on proficiency testing, and that it had misled the state inspector who surveyed its lab in late 2013. Erika closed the email by saying that she'd resigned from the company because she couldn't live with herself knowing that she could "potentially devastate someones [sic] life by giving them a false and deceiving result."</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while, Sunny Balwani, Daniel Young, Heather King, and Boies Schiller's Meredith Dearborn arrived. They took the two CMS inspectors to a conference room and insisted on giving them a PowerPoint presentation. Although it felt like a diversion tactic, Yamamoto and Bennett politely sat through it. As soon as it was over, they asked for a tour of the lab.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，桑尼．包汪尼、丹尼尔．杨、海瑟．金恩、还有BSF事务所的梅瑞蒂丝．迪尔波恩都来了。他们把两位CMS稽查员带到一间会议室，坚持为他们做演示文稿。虽然很明显是声东击西战术，山本和班奈特还是客气地坐下看完，等到演示文稿一结束，他们立刻要求巡视实验室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yamamoto and his superiors at CMS took the complaint so seriously that the agency launched a surprise inspection of Theranos's laboratory less than three days later. On the morning of Tuesday, September 22, Yamamoto and another field inspector from CMS's San Francisco regional office named Sarah Bennett arrived at the Newark facility and explained that they were there to survey the lab. Men in dark suits wearing earpieces denied them entry and told them to wait in a small reception room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山本和上司对这件投诉非常严正看待，不到三天后就发动突击稽查。九月二十二日星期二早上，山本和CMS旧金山分处稽查员莎拉．班奈特（Sarah Bennett）抵达纽华克厂区，说明来意，身穿深色西装、头戴耳机的男子不让他们进去，要他们到一间小会客室等候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they headed out of the conference room, they were escorted by more men in dark suits with fingers pressed to their ears. King and Dearborn followed close behind, holding laptops and taking notes. When they got to the lab rooms, they noticed that their doors were equipped with fingerprint scanners and that there was a buzzing sound when you entered. It reminded Yamamoto of the door buzzers in liquor stores.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走出会议室的时候，紧跟在他们身旁的深色西装男子人数更多了，每个人的手指都压着耳朵。金恩和迪尔波恩紧跟在后头，一面托着笔电做笔记。走到实验室时，他们发现门上装了指纹扫描仪，踏进去时还会发出警鸣声响，这让山本想起卖酒商店的门开启时的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they returned, the Journal investigation had been published, ratcheting up pressure on the agency to take action. Yamamoto noticed that security was a bit lighter and that Holmes was there to greet them. Balwani and King were also present again, along with a different set of outside attorneys and some lab consultants. The inspectors split up: Yamamoto roamed through the lab rooms and peppered the lab's personnel with questions, followed everywhere he went by Balwani, while Bennett set up shop in a conference room where King and the other lawyers kept close tabs on her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到他们再来的时候，《华尔街日报》的调查报导已经刊出，要求CMS有所作为的压力愈来愈大。山本注意到Theranos的安全警卫宽松了一点，而且霍姆斯在现场迎接他们，包汪尼和金恩也在场，还有另一组外部律师以及几位实验室顾问。两位稽查员分头进行，山本巡视实验室，不时向实验室人员提问，他不管走到哪里都有包汪尼紧跟着；班奈特则是进驻会议室，金恩和其他律师密切盯着她的一举一动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yamamoto and Bennett had initially set aside two days for the inspection, but they found so many problems and Theranos was missing so much basic lab documentation that they concluded they would have to return. Balwani asked for a two-month reprieve. He claimed that the company's new fiscal year was about to start and that it was in the midst of raising new funding. They agreed to come back in mid-November.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山本和班奈特起初预留的稽查时间是两天，不过他们发现问题太多，Theranos又有太多基本的实验室文档拿不出来，因此结论是有必要再来一趟。包汪尼提出暂缓两个月的请求，他宣称Theranos新的会计年度即将开始，正忙着进行新一轮募资。他们同意十一月中再来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time, they stayed four days. At one point, Bennett asked to conduct a confidential interview with one of the lab associates who worked in Normandy and had direct experience with the Edisons. She was made to wait in a windowless room for a long time until a young woman finally appeared. As soon as she sat down, the woman asked for an attorney. She looked coached and afraid.</div>

<div class="line_en">Erika Cheung and I had remained in sporadic contact after her parking lot scare in late June, but I didn't know she'd gathered the courage to reach out to a federal regulator. When I first heard about the CMS inspection, I had no idea it had been triggered by her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从艾芮卡六月底的停车场惊魂记之后，我和她断断续续一直有联系，不过我不知道她竟然鼓起勇气去找联邦监管单位，我第一次听说CMS去稽查时，完全没想到扳机是她扣的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Throughout the fall of 2015 and into the winter of 2016, I tried to find out what the inspection had uncovered. After Yamamoto and Bennett completed their second visit in November, there were rumblings from former Theranos employees in contact with current ones that it hadn't gone well, but details were hard to come by. In late January, we were finally able to publish a story reporting that the CMS inspectors had found "serious" deficiencies at the Newark lab, citing sources familiar with the matter. How serious became clear a few days later when the agency released a letter it had sent the company saying they posed "immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety." The letter gave the company ten days to come up with a credible correction plan and warned that failing to come back into compliance quickly could cause the lab to lose its federal certification.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从二〇一五年秋天一直到进入二〇一六年冬天，我不断想知道那次稽查到底查出了什么。山本和班奈特十一月完成二度稽查后，和现任员工还有联系的离职员工传出稽查结果不太好，不过细节很难得知。到了隔年一月底，根据知情人士的消息，我们终于刊登CMS稽查员在纽华克实验室发现「严重」缺失的报导。至于到底多严重，则在几天后揭晓，因为CMS公布一封先前寄给Theranos的信，信上说Theranos「对病患的健康和安全造成立即危险」，还给Theranos十天期限提出可靠的改正方案，并且警告如果未能尽速符合法规，将可能撤销实验室证照。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was major. The overseer of clinical laboratories in the United States had not only confirmed that there were significant problems with Theranos's blood tests, it had deemed the problems grave enough to put patients in immediate danger. Suddenly, Heather King's written retraction demands, which had been arriving like clockwork after each story we published, stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事很严重。全美负责监管临床实验室的单位，不仅证实Theranos的检验有很大问题，而且认为问题严重到足以立即置病人于险境。这次海瑟．金恩突然不再来信要求我们撤回报导——先前只要我们刊出一篇报导，她就会寄来要求撤销报导的书面文档，跟钟表一样准时。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, Theranos continued to minimize the seriousness of the situation. In a statement, it claimed to have already addressed many of the deficiencies and that the inspection findings didn't reflect the current state of the Newark lab. It also claimed that the problems were confined to the way the lab was run and had no bearing on the soundness of its proprietary technology. It was impossible to disprove these claims without access to the inspection report. CMS usually made such documents public a few weeks after sending them to the offending laboratory, but Theranos was invoking trade secrets to demand that it be kept confidential. Getting my hands on that report became essential.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，Theranos仍然继续淡化情势的严重性。在一份声明中，Theranos宣称已经解决许多缺失，还说稽查结果并不能反映纽华克实验室的现况，另外还说问题只局限于实验室的运作方式，无碍其独家技术的可靠性。看来，若要反驳他们的说法，非得取得那份稽查报告不可。CMS通常会先把这类报告寄给违规实验室，几个星期后再对外公开，可是Theranos以商业机密为由，要求CMS不得公开，变成我非得想办法亲手拿到那份报告不可。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I called a longtime source of mine in the federal government who had access to it. The most he was willing to do was read some passages over the phone. That was enough for us to report one of the inspection's most serious findings: the lab had continued to run a blood-clotting test for months despite repeated quality-control failures indicating that it was faulty. "Prothrombin time," as the test was known, was a dangerous test to get wrong because doctors relied on it to determine the dosage of blood-thinning medication they prescribed to patients at risk of strokes. Prescribing too much blood thinner could cause patients to bleed out, while prescribing too little could expose them to fatal clots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打电话给任职于联邦政府的长期线人，他有管道取得那份报告，但他最多只愿意透过电话念几段给我听，不过已经足以让我们写出一篇报导，揭发那次稽查最严重的发现之一：Theranos实验室无视一再出现的品管不合格显示有其缺失，仍执意继续进行一项凝血检验，长达数月。那项检验的名称为「凝血酶原时间」（prothrombin time），是一种一旦弄错会产生危害的检验，因为，医生要靠这项检验来决定有中风风险的病人该服用多少剂量的抗凝血药物，剂量太多可能造成病人出血，剂量太少可能使病人暴露于致命血栓的风险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theranos couldn't refute our story, but it argued once more that its proprietary technology was not at issue. The prothrombin time test had been performed on regular venous samples using commercial equipment, it said. When its back was against the wall, the company was willing to admit to using conventional analyzers if doing so could help maintain the illusion that its own devices worked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Theranos无从反驳我们的报导，但是再次辩称它的独家技术并非问题所在，他们说，凝血酶原时间检验一直是拿一般的静脉抽血样本用商用仪器所做。被逼到退无可退的墙角时，只要能维持自家设备是管用的假象，这家公司还是愿意承认使用的是传统分析仪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the tug-of-war with Heather King over the inspection report dragged on, news surfaced that Holmes would be hosting a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign at Theranos's headquarters in Palo Alto. She had long cultivated a relationship with the Clintons, appearing at several Clinton Foundation events and forging a friendship with their daughter. The fund-raiser was later relocated to the home of a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco, but a photo from the event showed Holmes holding a microphone and speaking to the assembled guests with Chelsea Clinton at her side. With the election eight months away and Clinton considered the front-runner, it was a reminder of how politically connected Holmes was. Enough to make her regulatory problems go away? Anything seemed possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场跟海瑟．金恩针对稽查报告的拔河持续拖延，另一方面有消息传出，霍姆斯将替希拉蕊．柯林顿的总统选战主办募款活动，地点就在Theranos位于帕罗奥图的总部。长久以来，她一直苦心经营跟柯林顿一家的关系，好几次现身柯林顿基金会（Clinton Foundation）活动，也跟他们的女儿创建起友谊。那场募款活动后来更换地点，改到一位科技创业家位于旧金山的家，不过从活动现场的照片可以看到，霍姆斯握着麦克风对全场宾客讲话，雀儿喜．柯林顿（Chelsea Clinton）就站在她身旁。八个月后就是大选投票日，而希拉蕊又被视为可能胜出的候选人，这提醒了我霍姆斯的政界人脉是多么丰沛，丰沛到足以使她从监管问题全身而退吗？任何事似乎都有可能。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To try to force CMS to release the inspection report, I filed a Freedom of Information Act request for any and all documents connected to the Newark lab inspection and requested that it be expedited. But Heather King continued to urge the agency not to make the report public without extensive redactions, claiming that doing so would expose valuable trade secrets. It was the first time the owner of a laboratory under the threat of sanctions had demanded redactions to an inspection report, and CMS seemed unsure how to proceed. With each passing day, I became concerned that the full inspection findings would never be released.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了逼迫CMS公布稽查报告，我提起「信息自由法」（FOIA），要求应该公开任何跟纽华克实验室稽查有关的文档，并且要求尽速公开。不过，海瑟．金恩仍然强烈要求CMS在未大幅删减的情况下，不可公开报告内容，宣称会造成商业机密外泄。这是破天荒头一遭有面临惩处的实验室，要求删减稽查报告，而CMS似乎不知该如何是好。随着一天天过去，我愈来愈担心完整的稽查报告，可能将永远不见天日。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">More important, the inspection report showed, citing the lab's own data, that the Edisons produced wildly erratic results. During one month, they had failed quality-control checks nearly a third of the time. One of the blood tests run on the Edisons, a test to measure a hormone that affects testosterone levels, had failed quality control an astounding 87 percent of the time. Another test, to help detect prostate cancer, had failed 22 percent of its quality-control checks. In comparison runs using the same blood samples, the Edisons had produced results that differed from those of conventional machines by as much as 146 percent. And just as Tyler Shultz had contended, the devices couldn't reproduce their own results. An Edison test to measure vitamin B12 had a coefficient of variation that ranged from 34 to 48 percent, far exceeding the 2 or 3 percent common for the test at most labs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更重要的是，这份稽查报告引用Theranos自己的数据证明，爱迪生的检验结果不稳定到离谱地步，光是一个月内，品管检查不合格的比例就占了三分之一。爱迪生的检验中，有一项是量测会影响睾固酮（testosterone）含量的荷尔蒙，品管检查不合格的比例竟高达八成七；还有一个检验是检查是否罹患摄护腺癌，品管不合格的比例也有二成二。拿同一份血液样本来对照，用爱迪生所做的结果跟用传统机器所做的结果，差距竟然有一‧四六倍之多。跟泰勒．舒兹说的一样，爱迪生做出的结果每次都不同。用爱迪生做维他命B12检验，变异系数是三四至四八％之间，远高于大多数实验室常见的二至三％。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went back to my source and, this time, cajoled him into leaking the whole inspection report to me. Running 121 pages long, the document was as damning as one could expect. For one thing, it proved that Holmes had lied at the Journal's tech conference the previous fall: the proprietary devices Theranos had used in the lab were indeed called "Edison," and the report showed it had used them for only twelve of the 250 tests on its menu. Every other test had been run on commercial analyzers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我再次回头找我的线人，这次终于成功说服他把整份稽查报告泄漏给我。这份长达一百二十一页的报告，一如所料罪证确凿。首先，这份报告证明了，霍姆斯去年秋天在《华尔街日报》科技会议上说谎。Theranos实验室所用的独家设备的的确确就是「爱迪生」，报告还显示，Theranos提供的二百五十种检验项目当中，只有十二种是用他们的独家设备运行，其他都是用商用分析仪。">查看中文翻译</div>

It said the company had failed to correct forty-three of the forty-five deficiencies the inspectors had cited it for and threatened to ban Holmes from the blood-testing business for two years. As with the inspection report, Theranos was desperately trying to keep the letter from becoming public, but a new source had contacted me out of the blue and leaked it to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we reported news of the threatened ban, it was no longer possible for Holmes to downplay the gravity of the situation. She had to come out and say something, so she gave an interview to Maria Shriver on NBC's Today show in which she professed to be "devastated."

In a complete about-face after years of intense secrecy, Holmes was going to unveil the inner workings of her technology at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry's annual meeting on August 1, 2016.

<div class="line_en">Not long afterward, Theranos contacted Tyler's lawyers and told them it knew about our meeting. Since neither of us had told a soul about it, we deduced that Holmes was having one or both of us followed. Fortunately, Tyler didn't seem too worried about it. "Next time maybe I'll take a selfie with you and send it her way to save her the trouble of hiring PIs," he quipped in an email.</div>

<div class="line_en">A week later, we reported that Theranos had voided tens of thousands of blood-test results, including two years' worth of Edison tests, in an effort to come back into compliance and avoid the CMS ban. In other words, it had effectively admitted to the agency that not a single one of the blood tests run on its proprietary devices could be relied upon. Once again, Holmes had hoped to keep the voided tests secret, but I found out about them from my new source, the one who had leaked to me CMS's letter threatening to ban Holmes from the lab industry. In Chicago, executives at Walgreens were astonished to learn of the scale of the test voidings. The pharmacy chain had been trying to get answers from Theranos about the impact on its customers for months. On June 12, 2016, it terminated the companies' partnership and shut down all the wellness centers located in its stores.</div>

<div class="line_en">In another crippling blow, CMS followed through on its threat to ban Holmes and her company from the lab business in early July. More ominously, Theranos was now the subject of a criminal investigation by the U. S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and of a parallel civil probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

<div class="line_en">What followed wasn't so much a scientific presentation as it was a new product exhibit. Over the next hour, Holmes proceeded to unveil the machine that had been but a malfunctioning prototype when Theranos had gone live with its blood tests nearly three years earlier: the miniLab. Theranos's engineers and chemists had improved the device since that early model, but the company still hadn't conducted a full clinical study to prove that it worked reliably across a wide range of assays using blood pricked from fingertips. While Holmes's presentation included some data, much of it involved venous blood drawn from the arm. The little finger-stick data it contained covered only eleven blood tests and wasn't independently verified or peer-reviewed.</div>

His comment drew a burst of applause from the audience. Reverting to the chastened persona from her Today show interview, Holmes acknowledged that Theranos had a lot of work to do, as she put it, to "engage" with the laboratory community.

Theranos had applied to the FDA for emergency-use authorization of the test, billing it as the first finger-stick blood test of its kind. But in another embarrassing setback, FDA inspectors soon discovered that the company had failed to include basic patient safeguards in its study, forcing it to withdraw the application.</div>

<div class="line_en">In an interview with the Financial Times, Geoffrey Baird, a professor of pathology at the University of Washington, said Holmes's presentation had included "a comically small amount of data" and had "the feel of someone putting together a last-minute term paper late at night." Other lab experts were quick to note that none of the miniLab's various components were novel. All Theranos had done was make them smaller and pack them into one box, they said.</div>
