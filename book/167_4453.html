<div class="line_en">A blowing rain lashed at Jon's face as he spurred his horse across the swollen stream. Beside him, Lord Commander Mormont gave the hood of his cloak a tug, muttering curses on the weather. His raven sat on his shoulder, feathers ruffled, as soaked and grumpy as the Old Bear himself. A gust of wind sent wet leaves flapping round them like a flock of dead birds. The haunted forest, Jon thought ruefully. The drowned forest, more like it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狂风夹着细雨，抽打在琼恩脸上，他踢踢马刺，跨过涨水的溪流。在他身旁，莫尔蒙总司令扯紧斗篷的兜帽，喃喃地诅咒着天气。他的乌鸦停在肩上，风弄皱了羽毛，使它看来和熊老本人一样又湿又躁。朔风突起，湿叶纷飞，好似一群死亡的飞鸟。鬼影森林啊，琼恩可怜兮兮地想，不如说是水淹森林。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hoped Sam was holding up, back down the column. He was not a good rider even in fair weather, and six days of rain had made the ground treacherous, all soft mud and hidden rocks. When the wind blew, it drove the water right into their eyes. The Wall would be flowing off to the south, the melting ice mingling with warm rain to wash down in sheets and rivers. Pyp and Toad would be sitting near the fire in the common room, drinking cups of mulled wine before their supper. Jon envied them. His wet wool clung to him sodden and itching, his neck and shoulders ached fiercely from the weight of mail and sword, and he was sick of salt cod, salt beef, and hard cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他暗自希望跟在后面的山姆还撑得住。就算天气和煦，他也骑得不好，而今，雨下了整整六天，路况变得十分凶险，处处是软泥和碎石。狂风卷起，漫天的雨落入眼睛。温暖的雨水混合融雪，注满所有的小溪与河流，让人以为南方的长城也说不定会被它们冲垮。此刻，派普和陶德一定会坐在大厅的炉火边，喝着晚餐前的开胃热葡萄酒。琼恩羡慕他们。他自己一身浸透的羊毛衣粘在身上，湿漉发痒，脖子和肩膀则因盔甲与长剑的重量而压得疼痛，更难受的是，他已彻底受够了盐鳕鱼，咸牛肉和硬奶酪的滋味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thoren Smallwood swore that Craster was a friend to the Watch, despite his unsavory reputation. "The man's half-mad, I won't deny it," he'd told the Old Bear, "but you'd be the same if you'd spent your life in this cursed wood. Even so, he's never turned a ranger away from his fire, nor does he love Mance Rayder. He'll give us good counsel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早前，索伦·斯莫伍德曾向大家保证，卡斯特虽然名声不好，但确是守夜人的朋友。“我承认，这家伙精神不太正常，”他告诉熊老，“但要换你在这受诅咒的森林待上一辈子，也会跟他一样。他虽然疯癫，却从不把我们游骑兵拒之门外，对曼斯·雷德更没好感。他应该能向我们提供一些忠告。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon had often heard the black brothers tell tales of Craster and his keep. Now he would see it with his own eyes. After seven empty villages, they had all come to dread finding Craster's as dead and desolate as the rest, but it seemed they would be spared that. Perhaps the Old Bear will finally get some answers, he thought. Anyway, we'll be out of the rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩常听黑衣兄弟们讲述卡斯特和他的堡垒的故事，现在终于亲眼目睹。经过了七座空无一人的村庄，每个人都开始怀疑卡斯特的堡垒是否也像其他地方一样死寂荒凉，幸好担忧没有成真。或许熊老能在那儿找到苦苦追寻的答案，他想，但至少，我们能摆脱大雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Up ahead a hunting horn sounded a quavering note, half drowned beneath the constant patter of the rain. "Buckwell's horn," the Old Bear announced. "The gods are good; Craster's still there." His raven gave a single flap of his big wings, croaked "Corn," and ruffled his feathers up again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前方，一只猎号发出震颤的声调，隔着交织的急雨显得分外朦胧。“是布克威尔，”熊老宣布，“诸神保佑，卡斯特总算没挪窝。”他的乌鸦把大黑翅膀扇了一扇，嘶哑地叫声“玉米”，便又继续整理羽毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So long as he gives us a hot meal and a chance to dry our clothes, I'll be happy. Dywen said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons. "And worse," the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth. "There's a cold smell to that one, there is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要他提供一顿热饭，提供屋檐和干燥衣服，我就很满足了。在戴文口中，卡斯特不仅弑杀亲人，还是骗子、强盗和懦夫，他甚至暗示对方和奴隶贩子与魔鬼打交道。“更可怕的是，”老林务官“劈啪劈啪”地嚼着木制假牙，补充道，“这混蛋身上有股寒冷的味道，真的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, my lord." Jon turned his horse back the way they'd come. It was pleasant to have the rain out of his face, if only for a little while. Everyone he passed seemed to be weeping. The march was strung out through half a mile of woods. In the midst of the baggage train, Jon passed Samwell Tarly, slumped in his saddle under a wide floppy hat. He was riding one dray horse and leading the others. The drumming of the rain against the hoods of their cages had the ravens squawking and fluttering. "You put a fox in with them?" Jon called out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“遵命，大人。”琼恩把马转回来时的方向。能让飞雨暂离自己的脸庞，虽然为时不长，他也觉得舒心。一路穿过众多兄弟，每人看来都像在哭泣，整个队列在树林中延伸半里之长。在辎重车辆间，琼恩遇见了山姆威尔·塔利，塔利戴着一顶宽边稻草软帽，无精打采地坐在鞍上。他骑着一匹高大笨拙的驮马，吆喝着其他几匹马。雨点嗡嗡地打在遮住铁笼的篷布上，里面的渡鸦拍打嘶叫，不住地抗议。“哈，你莫非放了只狐狸进去？”琼恩打招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jon," Lord Mormont commanded, "ride back along the column and spread the word. And remind the officers that I want no trouble about Craster's wives. The men are to mind their hands and speak to these women as little as need be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“琼恩，”莫尔蒙司令命令，“骑到后面去，把消息告诉大家。还有，提醒军官们约束部下，我不允许任何人打卡斯特老婆的主意。谁也不准毛手毛脚，没事少跟她们搭腔。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A bastard," Jon said with a laugh. "You can say it, Sam. I've heard the word before." He put the spurs to his surefooted little garron. "I need to hunt down Ser Ottyn. Be careful around Craster's women." As if Samwell Tarly needed warning on that score. "We'll talk later, after we've made camp."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“杂种，”琼恩笑道，“只管直说就是，山姆，我以前又不是没听过。”他踢踢马刺，驱策胯下那匹结实的矮马前进。“我得去找奥廷爵士。对了，不可招惹卡斯特的女人哦，”好像山姆威尔还需要提醒似的，“扎营以后，我们再聊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon carried the word back to Ser Ottyn Wythers, plodding along with the rear guard. A small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont, Ser Ottyn always looked tired, even at Castle Black, and the rain had beaten him down unmercifully. "Welcome tidings," he said. "This wet has soaked my bones, and even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="找到奥廷·威勒斯爵士时，他正率领后卫部队一路缓行。奥廷爵士和莫尔蒙年纪相当，矮短身材，尖尖的脸，模样总那么疲惫（从前在黑城堡时也一样）。大雨无情地冲刷着他。“好消息，”他说，“这里的湿气都浸进我骨头里去了，瞧，只怕连鞍子都在抗议哩，痛得很哪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam looked dubious. "Dolorous Edd says Craster's a terrible savage. He marries his daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself. And Dywen told Grenn he's got black blood in his veins. His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger, so he's a bas…" Suddenly he realized what he was about to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆露出半信半疑的神情。“忧郁的艾迪说卡斯特是个恐怖的野蛮人。他娶自己女儿为妻，除了自己订的规矩，什么律法都不依。戴文还跟葛兰说他身上流的是没心肝的黑血，因为他母亲是个女野人，和游骑兵通奸，才有他这个杂…”突然间，他住了嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On his way back, Jon swung wide of the column's line of march and took a shorter path through the thick of the wood. The sounds of man and horse diminished, swallowed up by the wet green wild, and soon enough he could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and tree and rock. It was midafternoon, yet the forest seemed as dark as dusk. Jon wove a path between rocks and puddles, past great oaks, grey-green sentinels, and black-barked ironwoods. In places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moment's respite from the drumming of the rain against his head. As he rode past a lightning-blasted chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses, he heard something rustling in the underbrush. "Ghost," he called out. "Ghost, to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回程路上，琼恩远远避开拉长的队列，转而在浓密的森林中选择捷径。人马的声音渐渐降低，吞没在润湿的绿荒中，不一会儿，耳中只剩瓢泼大雨击打叶子、树木和岩石的声响。天色刚入下午，森林里却黑如黄昏。琼恩在岩石和水坑之间寻找道路，穿过大橡树，灰绿的哨兵树和黑皮铁树。浓密的树枝为他搭起天篷，使他暂时摆脱雨点的敲打。骑经一棵被闪电击中，爬满野生白玫瑰的栗树时，他听见草丛里沙沙作响。“白灵，”他唤道，“白灵，过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's off hunting." Ghost did not like to travel with the column, but he would not be far. When they made camp for the night, he'd find his way to Jon at the Lord Commander's tent.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was Dywen who emerged from the greenery, forking a shaggy grey garron with Grenn ahorse beside him. The Old Bear had deployed outriders to either side of the main column, to screen their march and warn of the approach of any enemies, and even there he took no chances, sending the men out in pairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钻出来的却是戴文，他骑着一匹鬃毛杂乱的灰矮马，旁边还有葛兰。熊老在行军纵队两翼都派出轻骑，不仅为了探察地形，更为了警报敌人的逼近。他不敢大意，训令侦查兵们两两一组，结伴行动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ghost was trotting along beside Jon's horse with tail held high, his white fur ruffed up thick against the rain. He moved so silently Jon could not have said just when he appeared. Grenn's mount shied at the scent of him; even now, after more than a year, the horses were uneasy in the presence of the direwolf. "With me, Ghost." Jon spurred off to Craster's Keep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白灵小跑着来到琼恩马边，尾巴高翘，一身白毛在大雨中显得厚实了许多。他来去无声，琼恩也不知道是何时出现的。葛兰的马一闻到气息就惊得退开——即使现在，经过了一年多时间，马儿们还是没能习惯冰原狼的存在。“跟我走，白灵，”琼恩朝卡斯特的堡垒骑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the Wall, but he had pictured some sort of motte-and-bailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep. What they found instead was a midden heap, a pigsty, an empty sheepfold, and a windowless daub-and-wattle hall scarce worthy of the name. It was long and low, chinked together from logs and roofed with sod. The compound stood atop a rise too modest to name a hill, surrounded by an earthen dike. Brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping holes in the defenses, to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north, its thick waters turned into a murky torrent by the rains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不敢想像在离开长城这么远的地方还能发现石制城堡，所以便自顾自地勾勒出一幅树丛之中栏栅围着木楼的景象，没料到，事实却更为糟糕：这里只有一个垃圾堆，一间猪舍，一栏空虚的羊圈和一座枝条与泥土敷的厅堂，不值一提，连窗户都没有。大厅又长又矮，房木粗糙，屋顶上铺了草。这个“堡垒”建在一座简直不配称为山丘的小坡上，四周环绕着一道土堤。常年的雨水在堤防上蚀出无数小洞，棕色的水流随之溢下斜坡，汇入一道向北蜿蜒的奔流小溪，因为暴雨，原本便水源丰富的溪涧已成黑暗的急流。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the southwest, he found an open gate flanked by a pair of animal skulls on high poles: a bear to one side, a ram to the other. Bits of flesh still clung to the bear skull, Jon noted as he joined the line riding past. Within, Jarmen Buckwell's scouts and men from Thoren Smallwood's van were setting up horse lines and struggling to raise tents. A host of piglets rooted about three huge sows in the sty. Nearby, a small girl pulled carrots from a garden, naked in the rain, while two women tied a pig for slaughter. The animal's squeals were high and horrible, almost human in their distress. Chett's hounds barked wildly in answer, snarling and snapping despite his curses, with a pair of Craster's dogs barking back. When they saw Ghost, some of the dogs broke off and ran, while others began to bay and growl. The direwolf ignored them, as did Jon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="土堤西南方，有一扇开着的小门，门边有一对插着动物头骨的长竿：一边是熊头，一边是羊头。琼恩加入进门的大队伍，发现熊头上还有一点残存的血肉。里面，贾曼·布克威尔的侦察兵与索伦·斯莫伍德的前卫部队已经把马排成行，忙着搭帐篷了。猪圈里，一大群小猪偎在三头肥母猪身边。旁边，一个小女孩一丝不挂地蹲在雨中的菜园里拔萝卜，另两个女人正准备屠宰一头猪。牲畜尖声惨叫，高亢而恐怖，好似悲苦万分的人所发出的哭喊。齐特的猎狗们疯狂咆哮回应，且不管齐特怎么咒骂制止，它们还是吠个不休，惹得卡斯特养的一群狗也叫喊着回应。不过它们一见白灵，便纷纷住嘴，夹着尾巴逃走，只有少数几只还在低声抱怨，不肯认输。冰原狼对它们不理不睬，琼恩也一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, thirty of us will be warm and dry, Jon thought once he'd gotten a good look at the hall. Perhaps as many as fifty. The place was much too small to sleep two hundred men, so most would need to remain outside. And where to put them? The rain had turned half the compound yard to ankle-deep puddles and the rest to sucking mud. Another dismal night was in prospect.</div>

"He said for you to join him. Best leave the wolf outside, he looks hungry enough to eat one of Craster's children. Well, truth be told, I'm hungry enough to eat one of Craster's children, so long as he was served hot. Go on, I'll see to your horse. If it's warm and dry inside, don't tell me, I wasn't asked in."

Two dozen of the chief rangers had preceded him, and were standing around the firepit in the center of the dirt floor while puddles collected about their boots. The hall stank of soot, dung, and wet dog. The air was heavy with smoke, yet somehow still damp. Rain leaked through the smoke hole in the roof. It was all a single room, with a sleeping loft above reached by a pair of splintery ladders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“白灵，留在这儿，”他命令。卡斯特堡垒的门是两片鹿皮，琼恩推开它们，弯腰越过门楣。在他之前，已有二十来个游骑兵头目进了屋，围站在泥地正中的火盆边，水顺着靴子流下，聚成一个个小水塘。厅堂里混杂着煤灰、粪便和湿淋淋的狗的气味，很难闻。然而烟味虽重，空气却仍旧潮湿。雨水从屋顶的烟洞渗进。整栋屋子就只有这一个房间，外加顶上一个用做卧室的阁楼，通过一座摇摇欲坠的梯子相连。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Craster sat above the fire, the only man to enjoy his own chair. Even Lord Commander Mormont must seat himself on the common bench, with his raven muttering on his shoulder. Jarman Buckwell stood behind, dripping from patched mail and shiny wet leather, beside Thoren Smallwood in the late Ser Jaremy's heavy breastplate and sable-trimmed cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡斯特靠在火盆边，他是屋内惟一一个有椅子坐的人。连莫尔蒙司令都只能挤在长凳上，他的乌鸦在他肩上嘀咕着。贾曼·布克威尔站在他身后，打补丁的盔甲和湿得发亮的皮衣不住淌水，索伦·斯莫伍德也站在旁边，身穿以前属于杰瑞米爵士的胸甲和黑貂皮斗篷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon remembered how he'd felt the day they had left the Wall: nervous as a maiden, but eager to glimpse the mysteries and wonders beyond each new horizon. Well, here's one of the wonders, he told himself, gazing about the squalid, foul-smelling hall. The acrid smoke was making his eyes water. A pity that Pyp and Toad can't see all they're missing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩还记得从长城出发当天自己的感受：纵然紧张得像个出嫁的少女，却也心怀渴望，期待前方不断升起的陌生地平线后有怎样的神秘和奇迹。好啊，现在总算是发现了一个，他看着这间又脏又臭的大厅，一边告诉自己。辛辣的烟雾熏得他眼睛流泪。真可惜，派普和陶德错过了这么精彩的事儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Craster's sheepskin jerkin and cloak of sewn skins made a shabby contrast, but around one thick wrist was a heavy ring that had the glint of gold. He looked to be a powerful man, though well into the winter of his days now, his mane of hair grey going to white. A flat nose and a drooping mouth gave him a cruel look, and one of his ears was missing. So this is a wildling. Jon remembered Old Nan's tales of the savage folk who drank blood from human skulls. Craster seemed to be drinking a thin yellow beer from a chipped stone cup. Perhaps he had not heard the stories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相较之下，卡斯特一身羊皮背心和兽皮拼成的斗篷显得寒酸了许多，然而在他粗大的手腕上，却带有一只手镯，分量颇重，金光闪闪。他看上去虽已进入人生末途，头发由灰转白，时日应该不多，但毋庸置疑，仍旧是个很有力量的人。扁平的鼻子和下垂的嘴唇让他的模样带有几分凶残，他还缺了一只耳朵。这就是活生生的野人。琼恩想起老奶妈口中用头骨饮血的蛮人。但眼前的卡斯特喝的是淡黄啤酒，用的是琢石杯子。也许他根本不知道那些故事哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, those three I recall. The lordling no older than one of these pups. Too proud to sleep under my roof, him in his sable cloak and black steel. My wives give him big cow eyes all the same." He turned his squint on the nearest of the women. "Gared says they were chasing raiders. I told him, with a commander that green, best not catch 'em. Gared wasn't half-bad, for a crow. Had less ears than me, that one. The 'bite took 'em, same as mine." Craster laughed. "Now I hear he got no head neither. The 'bite do that too?"</div>

The people are gone… whether dead, fled, or taken, I could not say. The animals as well. Nothing is left. And earlier, we found the bodies of two of Ben Stark's rangers only a few leagues from the Wall. They were pale and cold, with black hands and black feet and wounds that did not bleed. Yet when we took them back to Castle Black they rose in the night and killed. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the other came for me, which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they lived, but there was no human mercy left in them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫尔蒙倾身向前，“一路走来，每个村子都遭遗弃。离开长城以后，你这儿是我们头一处见到活人的地方。其他人都消失了…被杀，逃走，还是被俘，我不知道。连动物也都不在了。什么都没有。早些时候，我们还在离长城仅几里格的地方找到班杨·史塔克手下两个游骑兵的尸体。他们苍白冰冷，手脚乌黑，伤口不流血。我们把他们带回黑城堡，他们却在半夜里爬起来杀人。其中一个杀掉了杰瑞米·莱克爵士，另一个跑来杀我，可见他们虽然保留着生前的某些记忆，但已经换成了一副毫无人性的歹毒心肠。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"There's much I could tell you o' Rayder and his doings, if I had a mind. This o' the empty villages, that's his work. You would have found this hall abandoned as well, if I were a man to scrape to such. He sends a rider, tells me I must leave my own keep to come grovel at his feet.

<div class="line_en">"Now, that is the question. How many wildlings are there? How many men of fighting age? No one knows with certainty. The Frostfangs are cruel, inhospitable, a wilderness of stone and ice. They will not long sustain any great number of people. I can see only one purpose in this gathering. Mance Rayder means to strike south, into the Seven Kingdoms."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，这正是关键所在。那里‘究竟’有多少野人？其中又有多少能操起武器作战？没有人说得清。霜雪之牙是一片严酷、冷漠、荒凉的冰山，无法供养大批人群长期停留。照我分析，曼斯·雷德只有一个目的——南下长城，扫荡七大王国。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What will we do?" asked Jon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们该怎么办？”琼恩问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wildlings have invaded the realm before." Jon had heard the tales from Old Nan and Maester Luwin both, back at Winterfell. "Raymun Redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfather's grandfather, and before him there was a king named Bael the Bard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从前，野人也曾大举入侵，”在临冬城时，这些故事琼恩都听老奶妈和鲁温师傅讲过，“在我祖父的祖父的时代，‘红胡子’雷蒙率领他们南下，再往前，‘吟游诗人’贝尔也曾兵临城下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye, and long before them came the Horned Lord and the brother kings Gendel and Gorne, and in ancient days Joramun, who blew the Horn of Winter and woke giants from the earth. Each man of them broke his strength on the Wall, or was broken by the power of Winterfell on the far side… but the Night's Watch is only a shadow of what we were, and who remains to oppose the wildlings besides us? The Lord of Winterfell is dead, and his heir has marched his strength south to fight the Lannisters. The wildlings may never again have such a chance as this. I knew Mance Rayder, Jon. He is an oathbreaker, yes… but he has eyes to see, and no man has ever dared to name him faintheart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，比他们更早，有‘长角王’，‘兄弟王’詹德尔和戈尼，在远古，还有吹响冬之号角、从地底唤醒巨人的乔曼，他们都做过同样的尝试，但每次不是在长城下一败涂地，就是被临冬城的援军奋力杀退…但如今，且不论守夜人军团的实力只有夕日的一鳞半爪，又有谁会与我们并肩作战、对抗野人呢？临冬城主已经丧命，他的继承人带着所有军队南下与兰尼斯特交兵。对野人们而言，这是千载难逢的大好机会。琼恩，我很了解曼斯．雷德，不错，他背弃了誓言…但他为人一向目光敏锐，行事果断，是个千里挑一的人才。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Find him," said Mormont. "Fight him. Stop him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“找到他，”莫尔蒙道，“了结他，阻止他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three hundred, thought Jon, against the fury of the wild. His fingers opened and closed.</div>
