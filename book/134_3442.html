<div class="line_en">No, I haven't had much actual experience, she would have to say, and she felt a sink of failure. She hadn't even an apprentice's job behind her, except that two-day job in Montclair, making the cardboard model that the amateur group had finally used, if that could be called a job. She had taken two courses in scenic design in New York, and she had read a lot of books. She could hear Phil McElroy -- an intense and very busy young man, probably, a little annoyed at having come to see her for nothing -- saying regretfully that she wouldn't do after all. But with Richard present, Therese thought, it wouldn't be quite as crushing as if she were alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她可能得说，自己的实务经验不多，但这样说又令她深感挫败。她连实习的经验都没有，只有那次在蒙克莱尔上了两天班，用纸板做了个模型，最后给一个业余团体拿去用。不知道这样能不能算是工作经验。她在纽约修过两门舞台设计的课，也读了很多书。菲尔·麦克艾洛伊这个紧张而忙碌的年轻人，说不定会为了大老远跑来见她而有点生气，她似乎可以听见菲尔遗憾地说她胜任不了。特芮丝转念又想，既然有理查德在场，结果应当不会像她自己面对一样恐怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She changed into a dress, and hung a short silver chain with a St. Christopher medallion, a birthday present from Richard, around her neck, and combed her hair with a little water so it would look neater.

<div class="line_en">Richard had quit or been fired from about five jobs since she had known him. Nothing bothered Richard less than losing and finding jobs. Therese remembered being fired from the Pelican Press a month ago, and she winced. They hadn't even given her notice, and the only reason she had been fired, she supposed, was that her particular research assignment had been finished. When she had gone in to speak to Mr. Nussbaum, the president, about not being given notice, he had not known, or had pretended not to know, what the term meant. "Notiz?-- Wuss?" he had said indifferently, and she had turned and fled, afraid of bursting into tears in his office. It was easy for Richard, living at home with a family to keep him cheerful. It was easier for him to save money. He had saved about two thousand in a two-year hitch in the Navy, and a thousand more in the year since. And how long would it take her to save the fifteen hundred dollars that a junior membership in the stage designers' union cost? After nearly two years in New York, she had only about five hundred dollars of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打从她认识理查德开始，他不是辞职就是被开除，大概换过五个工作。失业再找工作，对理查德来说根本就是稀松平常。特芮丝想起她一个月前被鹈鹕出版社开除，不禁畏缩了，他们连事前的通知都舍不得给，她猜想自己被辞退的唯一理由，就是当初指派给她的研究工作已经完成了。她跑进去跟董事长努斯邦先生说自己没收到通知时，他竟然不知道，或假装不知道“通知”这个词是什么意思。“通‘资’？什么啊？”他说得很冷淡，而她立刻转身逃走，担心自己会在他办公室里迸出泪来。理查德的处境比较好，他住在家里，有家人为伴，让他保持心情愉快。对他来说存钱更容易。他在海军服役两年期间，存了大约两千元，一年后又存了一千多元。要加入舞台设计师工会成为初级会员，得花一千五百元，她要多久才能存到这一千五百元哪！在纽约待了将近两年，她只有五百元左右。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pray for me," she said to the wooden Madonna on the bookshelf. It was the one beautiful thing in her apartment, the wooden Madonna she had bought the first month she had been in New York. She wished there were a better place for it in the room than on the ugly bookshelf. The bookshelf was like a lot of fruit crates stacked up and painted red. She longed for a bookshelf of natural-colored wood, smooth to the touch and sleek with wax.</div>

<div class="line_en">She went down to the delicatessen and bought six cans of beer and some blue cheese. Then when she came upstairs, she remembered the original purpose of her going to the store, to buy some meat for dinner. She and Richard had planned to have dinner in tonight. That might be changed now, but she didn't like to take it on her own initiative to alter plans where Richard was concerned, and she was about to run down again for the meat when Richard's long ring sounded. She pressed the release button.</div>

It's just a little company in the Village, and you've probably got more talent than all the rest of them put together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道。我只知道他们需要有人做舞台背景，那为什么不找你呢？”理查德仔细打量她，笑了起来，“你今晚看来好美，别紧张好吗？只是一家在格林威治村的小公司，说不定你的才华比他们所有人加在一起还要多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So so. That's something I want to work on at home," he said carelessly. "We had that redheaded model today, the one I like."</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese wanted to see his sketch, but she knew Richard probably didn't think it good enough. Some of his first paintings were good, like the lighthouse in blues and blacks that hung over her bed, that he had done when he was in the Navy and just starting to paint. But his life drawing was not good yet, and Therese doubted that it ever would be. There was a new charcoal smudge all over one knee of his tan cotton trousers. He wore a shirt inside the red and black checked shirt, and buckskin moccasins that made his big feet look like shapeless bear paws. He was more like a lumberjack or a professional athlete of some sort, Therese thought, than anything else. She could more easily imagine him with an ax in his hand than a paintbrush. She had seen him with an ax once, cutting wood in the yard back of his house in Brooklyn. If he didn't prove to his family that he was making some progress in his painting, he would probably have to go into his father's bottled gas business this summer, and open the branch in Long Island that his father wanted him to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝想看他画的素描，但她也知道理查德可能认为那些作品还不够好。他最早有些画还不错，例如挂在她床上方、用蓝色和黑色画出来的灯塔，是他在海军服役时画的，他那时才刚开始画画。但他的素描不好，而且特芮丝怀疑他可能永远不会进步了。他褐色的棉裤上有只膝盖沾满了炭污；红黑格子衬衫里面穿了件T恤，鹿绒皮鞋让他宽大的双脚看起来像奇形怪状的熊掌。特芮丝想，他看起来比较像伐木工人或某种职业运动选手，她可以轻易想见他手里握着斧头，而非画笔。她看过他拿斧头，那次他在布鲁克林家里的后院砍木头。如果他不能向家人证明他的绘画事业有进展，很可能今年夏天他就必须到他父亲的桶装瓦斯行上班，按照父亲的愿望，在长岛开一家分店。">查看中文翻译</div>

The family asked if you could come out for dinner, but we don't have to stay long. I could borrow a truck and we could drive somewhere in the afternoon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德笑了起来。“这是个阴谋。”他执起她的手，把她的双臂环绕在自己的腰上，目光不断在房里搜索。“还是礼拜天？我家人问你能不能出来吃晚餐，我们不必待太久。我可以借一辆卡车，我们下午先开到别的地方去玩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"I did buy a steak for tonight, but they stole it at the store."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊。”她和理查德都喜欢这样，坐在大大的卡车上，爱开到哪里都行，自由自在，仿佛乘着蝴蝶飞舞。她把手从理查德的腰际抽回来，环抱着理查德的腰让她感觉很不自然，又有点愚蠢，好像站在那里抱着树干。“我真的有买牛排想要晚上吃，可是放在百货公司里被人偷走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Off the shelf where we keep our handbags. The people they hire for Christmas don't get any regular lockers." She smiled at it now, but this afternoon, she had almost wept. Wolves, she had thought, a pack of wolves, stealing a bloody bag of meat just because it was food, a free meal. She had asked all the salesgirls if they had seen it, and they had all denied it. Bringing meat into the store wasn't allowed, Mrs. Hendrickson had said indignantly. But what was one to do, if all the meat stores closed at six o'clock?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从我们放手提袋的架子上偷的。我是圣诞节雇来的临时工，没有置物柜可以放东西。”想到这一点她笑了起来，但今天下午她差点就要哭出来了。狼心狗肺的东西，她当时想道，这群狼，偷走一袋该死的肉，就因为袋子里是食物，免费的一餐。她问过所有的售货员，但每个人都否认。亨德里克森太太曾愤怒地说，不可以把生肉品带到百货公司里来。可是如果所有的肉店都在六点关门，那又要怎么办呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard lay back on the studio couch. His mouth was thin and its line uneven, half of it downward slanting, giving an ambiguity to his expression, a look sometimes of humor, sometimes of bitterness, a contradiction that his rather blank and frank blue eyes did nothing to clarify.

<div class="line_en">And now, Richard and Phil were talking about a man who owed Richard money from somewhere. Phil said he had seen the man last night in the San Remo bar. Phil's elongated face and his clipped hair was like an El Greco, Therese thought, yet the same features in his brother looked like an American Indian. And the way Phil talked completely destroyed the illusion of El Greco. He talked like any of the people one saw in Village bars, young people who were supposed to be writers or actors, and who usually did nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were walking down Third Avenue. And Richard was talking to Phil about their going to Europe next summer. Therese felt a throb of embarrassment as she walked along behind Richard, like a dangling appendage, because Phil and Dannie would naturally think she was Richard's mistress. She wasn't his mistress, and Richard didn't expect her to be in Europe. It was a strange relationship, she supposed, and who would believe it? Because from what she had seen in New York, everybody slept with everybody they had dates with more than once or twice. And the two people she had gone out with before Richard -- Angelo and Harry -- had certainly dropped her when they discovered she didn't care for an affair with them. She had tried to have an affair with Richard three or four times in the year she had known him, though with negative results; Richard said he preferred to wait. He meant wait until she cared more for him. Richard wanted to marry her, and she was the first girl he had ever proposed to, he said. She knew he would ask her again before they left for Europe, but she didn't love him enough to marry him. And yet she would be accepting most of the money for the trip from him, she thought with a familiar sense of guilt. Then the image of Mrs. Semco, Richard's mother, came before her, smiling approval on them, on their marrying, and Therese involuntarily shook her head.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he tucked her arm closer anyway. She was cold, and felt rather miserable in general. It was the half dangling, half cemented relationship with Richard, she knew. They saw more and more of each other, without actually growing closer. She still wasn't in love with him, not after ten months, and maybe she never could be, though the fact remained that she liked him better than any one person she had ever known, certainly any man. Sometimes she thought she was in love with him, waking up in the morning and looking blankly at the ceiling, remembering suddenly that she knew him, remembering suddenly his face shining with affection for her because of some gesture of affection on her part, before her sleepy emptiness had time to fill up with the realization of what time it was, what day, what she had to do, the soldier substance that made up one's life. But the feeling bore no resemblance to what she had read about love. Love was supposed to be a kind of blissful insanity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard was convinced, and Therese tried hard to realize it might be a great moment. But she couldn't recapture even the certainty she remembered when she had looked at the orange washcloth in the basin after Richard's telephone call. She leaned against the stool next to Phil's, and Richard stood beside her, still talking to him. The glaring white light on the white tile walls and the floor seemed brighter than sunlight, for here there were no shadows. She could see every shiny black hair in Phil's eyebrows, and the rough and smooth spots on the pipe Dannie held in his hand, unlighted. She could see the details of Richard's hand that hung limply out of his overcoat sleeve, and she was conscious again of their incongruity with his limber, long-boned body.</div>
