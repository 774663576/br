<div class="line_en">When the people in Central Park learned that one of the toy sailboats was being steered by a mouse in a sailor suit, they all came running. Soon the shores of the pond were so crowded that a policeman was sent from headquarters to announce that everybody would have to stop pushing, but nobody did. People in New York like to push each other. The most excited person of all was the boy who owned the Lillian B. Womrath. He was a fat, sulky boy of twelve, named LeRoy. He wore a blue serge suit and a white necktie stained with orange juice.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I thank you for your kind offer," replied Stuart, "but I am happy aboard the Wasp -- happier than I have ever been before in all my life." And with that he spun the wheel over smartly and headed his schooner down toward the starting line, where LeRoy was turning his boat around by poking it with a long stick, ready for the start of the race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你为我提供了这么多的好条件，”斯图亚特回答，“但我在黄蜂号上很幸福——比我一生中在别的任何地方都要幸福得多。”斯图亚特说着，非常熟练地转动着舵轮，把他的纵帆船掉头面向出发点驶去，而勒鲁瓦正在那里用一根长长的小棍子去捅他的船，好让她转到比赛的起点处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And away went the two boats for the north end of the pond, while the seagulls wheeled and cried overhead and the taxicabs tooted and honked from Seventy-second Street and the west wind (which had come halfway across America to get to Central Park) sang and whistled in the rigging and blew spray across the decks, stinging Stuart's cheeks with tiny fragments of flying peanut shell tossed up from the foamy deep. "This is the life for me!" Stuart murmured to himself. "What a ship! What a day! What a race!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两艘帆船朝池塘的北边驶去，海鸥们也跟过来，在头顶欢叫着。从第 72 街纷纷开来的出租车，不停地鸣着喇叭（它们都是横穿了半个美国才开到中央公园来的），西风唱着，把浪花泼洒到甲板上，也把如泡沫一样多的丢在水里的花生壳碎片卷起来，击打向斯图亚特的面颊。“这才是我要的生活！”斯图亚特自语道。“多好的帆船！多美的一天！多棒的比赛！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the two boats had gone many feet, however, an accident happened on shore. The people were pushing each other harder and harder in their eagerness to see the sport, and although they really didn't mean to, they pushed the policeman so hard they pushed him right off the concrete wall and into the pond. He hit the water in a sitting position, and got wet clear up to the third button of his jacket. He was soaked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这两艘船还没有开远之前，岸上就发生了一个事故。为了渴望能看清这场比赛，人们推挤得越来越厉害，所以虽然他们不想这么干，可还是把那个警察从水泥墙边狠狠地推进了池塘，他以一种坐着的姿势落到了水里，水一直没到他外衣的第三粒纽扣为止。他几乎完全被浸湿了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This particular policeman was not only a big, heavy man, but he had just eaten a big, heavy meal, and the wave he made went curling outward, cresting and billowing, upsetting all manner of small craft and causing every owner of a boat on the pond to scream with delight and consternation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个警察不是很高，很胖，但是他刚刚吃了一顿极其丰盛的大餐，而且他的坠落也激起了很高的大浪，所以打翻了不少的小船，令岸边的船主们先是惊愕，继而又开心地大笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Stuart saw the great wave approaching he jumped for the rigging, but he was too late. Towering above the Wasp like a mountain, the wave came crashing and piling along the deck, caught Stuart up and swept him over the side and into the water, where everybody supposed he would drown. Stuart had no intention of drowning. He kicked hard with his feet, and thrashed hard with his tail, and in a minute or two he climbed back aboard the schooner, cold and wet but quite unharmed. As he took his place at the helm, he could hear people cheering for him and calling, "Atta mouse, Stuart! Atta mouse!" He looked over and saw that the wave had capsized the Lillian B. Womrath but that she had righted herself and was sailing on her course, close by. And she stayed close alongside till both boats reached the north end of the pond. Here Stuart put the Wasp about and LeRoy turned the Lillian around with his stick, and away the two boats went for the finish line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当斯图亚特见到涌过来的巨浪，忙往帆的支索那里跳去，可是却已经太晚了。黄蜂号上方倾来的大浪就像山一样高，浪涛汹涌着打上了甲板，把斯图亚特扫向一边，又击到了水里，每个人都以为他被淹死了。斯图亚特可不打算被淹死。他用脚使劲击打着水，用他的尾巴拼命平衡着身体，一两分钟后就又爬上了纵帆船，虽然身上又冷又湿，但却丝毫未损。当他坐回到舵轮旁，能听到人们在为他欢呼呐喊，“好老鼠，斯图亚特，好老鼠！”他回头看去，发现大浪已经把莉莲·B·沃拉尔号弄翻了，不过她很快就又立了起来，朝他的船这边开过来。于是他就把船停到边上等着，直到那艘船也开过来，和他一起开到池塘北边的尽头。斯图亚特把黄蜂号掉过头，勒鲁瓦也用他的小棍子把莉莲号拨了过来，于是两艘船就一起往终点开回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first warning he had that there was trouble ahead came when he glanced into the Wasp's cabin and observed that the barometer had fallen sharply. That can mean only one thing at sea -- dirty weather. Suddenly a dark cloud swept across the sun, blotting it out and leaving the earth in shadow. Stuart shivered in his wet clothes. He turned up his sailor blouse closer around his neck, and when he spied the Wasp's owner among the crowd on shore he waved his hat and called out:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个麻烦来了。他瞥了一眼黄蜂号的船舱，发现里面的气压计上的指数在飞速的往下降。在航海时这种情况只意味着一件事——暴风雨要来了。突然间，一团黑云扫向太阳，遮住了它，给大地蒙上了阴影。穿着湿衣服的斯图亚特冷得直发抖，他把他的水手衫推到了脖子上。他在岸边的人群中瞥见了黄蜂号的船主，便向他挥舞着帽子高喊：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This race isn't over yet," thought Stuart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这场比赛还没有完呢，”斯图亚特想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never mind the weather!" cried the owner. "Watch out for flotsam dead ahead!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look out, Stuart! Look out where you're going!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当心，斯图亚特！当心你在做的事情！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stuart peered ahead into the gathering storm, but saw nothing except gray waves with white crests. The world seemed cold and ominous. Stuart glanced behind him. There came the sloop, boiling along fast, rolling up a bow wave and gaining steadily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯图亚特仔细察看了一下前面是否有风暴来临的迹象，可是除了浪尖是白色的灰色水浪外什么都没看到。这个世界好象变冷了，充满着恶兆。他又朝后面看了看，发现开过来一艘单桅船，她的船头在浪花里剧烈地摆动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dirty weather ahead, sir! Wind backing into the south-west, seas confused, glass falling."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“暴风雨要来了，先生！风向正在转成西南，海水开始翻滚，气压计的指数在下降！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stuart strained his eyes, and suddenly, dead ahead, right in the path of the Wasp, he saw an enormous paper bag looming up on the surface of the pond. The bag was empty and riding high, its open end gaping wide like the mouth of a cave. Stuart spun the wheel over but it was too late: the Wasp drove her bowsprit straight into the bag and with a fearful whooosh the schooner slowed down and came up into the wind with all sails flapping. Just at this moment Stuart heard a splintering crash, saw the bow of the Lillian plow through his rigging, and felt the whole ship tremble from stem to stern with the force of the collision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯图亚特竭力睁大眼睛看，突然，他看到就在黄蜂号的右边，有一只巨大的纸袋正从池塘的水面上飘过来。这个纸袋是空的，被风鼓得高高的，张着大嘴，就像一个洞穴一样。斯图亚特急忙转舵，但却太迟了：黄蜂号已经把她的船头斜帆扎进了纸袋里。随着一阵可怕的嘶嘶声，纵帆船的速度慢了下来，所有的帆也都被风猛烈地吹动着。就在那时斯图亚特听到了一阵撕裂声，看到了正向船的支索撞去的莉莲号的船头，感觉从船头到船尾都有一种可怕的力量在撞击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stuart grabbed the foresail boom and pulled with all his might. Slowly the schooner paid off and began to gather headway. And as she heeled over to the breeze she rolled her rail out from under the Lillian's nose, shook herself free, and stood away to the southard. A loud cheer went up from the bank. Stuart sprang to the wheel and answered it. Then he looked back, and to his great joy he perceived that the Lillian had gone off in a wild direction and was yawing all over the pond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯图亚特抓住前桅支索帆的帆脚，尽可能地将其拉满。纵帆船慢慢地恢复了平衡，开始往前移动了。当她的帆的下部逆着微风张起来，她的栏杆也从莉莲号的船头突起处摆脱出来后，她便自由地往南驶去了。岸上发出了一片喝彩声。斯图亚特一面开着舵轮，一面大声回应着。他再回头看时，惊喜地发现莉莲号狂乱地扭动了一下后便炸裂了，岸上所有的人都在高叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Straight and true sailed the Wasp, with Stuart at the helm. After she had crossed the finish line, Stuart brought her alongside the wall, and was taken ashore and highly praised for his fine seamanship and daring. The owner was delighted and said it was the happiest day of his life. He introduced himself to Stuart, said that in private life he was Dr. Paul Carey, a surgeon-dentist. He said model boats were his hobby and that he would be delighted to have Stuart take command of his vessel at any time.
