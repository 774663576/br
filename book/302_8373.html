<div class="line_en">The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable. About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达什伍德家的客人除了巴顿庄园一家人，来自别处的并不多。虽然约翰爵士一再恳请她们多与左近邻舍交往，并且一再保证她们可以随时使用他的马车，怎奈达什伍德太太禀性好强，只能委屈女儿们少与外人来往。凡是步行所不能及的人家，她一概拒不走访。其实，属于这种情况的人家本来就寥寥无几，何况还不都是能拜访得成的。一次，小姐们才到不久，出去散步，顺着弯弯曲曲的艾伦汉峡谷漫步走去（前面提到，这就是从巴顿村分出的那条支谷）。在离乡舍大约一英里半的地方，发现一幢古老气派的大宅第。这座宅第多少使她们想起了诺兰庄园，激起了她们的兴趣和遐想，情不自禁地想仔细瞧瞧。谁知一打听，才知道房主是个性情和悦的老太太，不幸的是，她体弱多病，不能与世交往，从来不出家门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们兴高采烈地往山上爬去，每次瞥见蓝天，都为自己的先见之明而感到高兴。一股令人振奋的强劲的西南风迎面扑来，两人不由得为母亲和埃丽诺顾虑重重、未能来分享她们的快乐而感到惋惜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个乡间，曲径交错，景致优美。一座座高耸的山冈，从乡舍的窗口望去十分诱人，小姐们禁不住想攀登上去寻幽探胜。又见谷中灰尘弥漫，缔丽的景色尽被遮断，只有爬上山顶，才能尽情领略。一个难以忘怀的早晨，玛丽安和玛格丽特迈步向一座山上爬去。她们深为透过阵雨洒下的阳光之美所吸引。同时，两天来阴雨连绵，一直把她们关在家里，憋得实在受不了。不过，尽管玛丽安声称当天全天见晴，乌云就要从山顶上驱散，这天气还是无力把妈妈和姐姐吸引出来，她们依然是画画的画画，看书的看书。于是，两位小姐就一块出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face. -- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛格丽特欣然同意。两人顶风前进，嘻嘻哈哈地又走了大约二十分钟。骤然间，头上乌云密布，倾盆大雨劈头盖脸地泼洒下来。两人又恼又惊，只好无可奈何地往回转，因为附近没有比她们家更近的避雨处。不过，她们还有个聊以自慰的地方：在这紧急关头，也是显得异常得当的，她们可以用最快的速度跑下陡峭的山坡，径直冲到她们的花园门口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom in safety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人起跑了。玛丽安起先跑在前头，谁想冷不防给绊倒了。玛格丽特想停下来去扶她，却怎么也煞不住脚，身不由己地冲了下去，平安地到达山底。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried her down the hill. Then passing through the garden, the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在玛丽安出事的当儿，凑巧有个男子端着一支抢，领着两只猎犬，朝山上爬去，离玛丽安不过几码远。他放下抢，跑过去扶她。玛丽安从地上爬起来，不料脚给摔扭了，根本站不起来。那男子上来搀她，发现她出于羞怯，不肯让他帮忙，但事不宜迟，他还是把她抱起来，送下了山，然后穿过花园（玛格丽特进来时没有关门），将她径直抱进屋里。这时，玛格丽特也刚刚进来。那男子把玛丽安放在客厅的一张椅子上坐稳，然后才松开手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which always attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她几次三番地向他道谢，并且带着她那素有的亲切口吻，请他坐下。不过，这被他谢绝了，因为他浑身又脏又湿。随后，达什伍德太太请问他的姓名，他说他姓威洛比，现在住在艾伦汉，希望能赏光，允许他明天来向达什伍德小姐问安。达什伍德太太欣然同意，随即他便冒着大雨告辞，这就便他更加惹人喜爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice and expression. Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺和母亲。一见他们进来，便都惊愕地站了起来。两人目不转睛地盯着那男子，对他的出现明里表示诧异，暗里表示赞叹。那男子对自己的贸然闯入，一面表示歉意，一面陈述理由，态度诚挚大方。人本来就非常英俊，再听那声音，看那表情，更增添了几分魅力。即令他又老又丑，俗不可耐，达什伍德太太就凭他救护女儿这一点，也会对他感激不尽，竭诚相待，何况他年轻貌美，举止文雅，使她对他的行为越发叹赏不绝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions. -- Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威洛比的堂堂仪表和不凡风度立即成为全家交口称赞的主题，她们取笑他对玛丽安过于股勤，特别是一想起他那迷人的外表，便更加嗤笑不已。玛丽安对他不如别人看得仔细，因为她一被他抱起，就羞得满腔通红，进屋后哪里顾得上去仔细打量他。不过，她也看了个大概，便跟着众人一起大加赞赏，而且总是那么起劲。他的人品风度堪与她想象中的故事里的英雄人物相媲美。他能事先不拘礼节地把她抱回家，可见真够当机立断的，这就使她特别称赞他的行为。他一切的一切都很有趣。他的名字动听，住在她们最喜爱的村庄里。玛丽安很快发现，在所有的男式服装中，就数狩猎夹克最神气。她浮想联翩，心里不觉喜滋滋的，早把脚踝的伤痛抛到九霄云外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was to inherit; adding, "Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这一点上，约翰爵士可以提供比较确凿的情报。他对她们说：威洛比先生在乡下没有自己的资产，他只是来探望艾伦汉大院的老太太，在那里住几天，他与老太太沾点亲，以后要继承她的财产。然后又补充说“是的，达什伍德小姐，老实跟你说吧，他很值得追求。除了这里，他在萨默塞特郡还有一座小庄园。假若我是你的话，决不把他让给妹妹，尽管他们一起滚下了山。玛丽安小姐别想独霸所有的男人。她若是不当心，布兰登会吃醋的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
