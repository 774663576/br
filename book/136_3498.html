<div class="line_en">Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak. They had done it, they had done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on O'Brien's doorstep. But merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived. The whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro -- everything was intimidating. Although he had a good pretext for coming here, he was haunted at every step by the fear that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out. O'Brien's servant, however, had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark-haired man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless face which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. Winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies.</div>

<div class="line_en">The room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet. At the far end of the room O'Brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of papers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up when the servant showed Julia and Winston in.</div>

<div class="line_en">He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet. A little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the Newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any kind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible to explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.</div>

<div class="line_en">O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently.

<div class="line_en">Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midst of his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled his spectacles on his nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他现在站在了他们对面。他结实的身躯像塔一样耸立在他们面前，他脸上的表情依然不可捉摸。他有点儿严肃，等着温斯顿说话，但说什么呢？即使现在，很明显他是一个忙人，有点恼火，不明白为什么被打扰。没有人说话。电幕关掉后，室内似乎死一般的静。几秒钟过去了，真是漫长的几秒钟。温斯顿艰难地继续看着奥布莱恩。接着，那张严肃的脸突然露出了可以说是一丝笑意。奥布莱恩用习惯的姿势正了正鼻子上的眼镜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives.

He went on, conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他住了口，第一次意识到他自身动机的含混不清。由于实际上他并不知道他能从奥布莱恩这儿得到什么帮助，因而要说清楚他为什么来这儿很不容易。他接着往下说，又觉得他所说的听起来既无力又像是借口：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses.</div>

<div class="line_en">The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding -- a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小个子坐了下来，相当自然，但还是有点仆人的神态，这是一种享有某种特权的贴身侍仆的神态。温斯顿从眼角打量着他。他想这个人的一生都在扮演一个角色，他觉得要他丢下这种假定的角色，即使是暂时的，也很危险。奥布莱恩拿起瓶子往玻璃杯里倒一种暗红色饮料。这唤起温斯顿某种朦胧的回忆，那是很久以前在墙上或广告牌上看到的——一只由电灯组成的大瓶子，瓶口能上下移动，将瓶里的东西倒在一只玻璃杯里。从上面看下去，那饮料几乎是黑色的，但在酒瓶里它却泛着光泽，像一块红宝石。它有一种酸而甜的味道。他看见朱丽亚端起玻璃杯，好奇地闻了闻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Martin is one of us," said O'Brien impassively. "Bring the drinks over here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have we enough chairs? Then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself, Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is called wine," said O'Brien with a faint smile. "You will have read about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am afraid." His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: "I think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To Emmanuel Goldstein."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这叫葡萄酒，”奥布莱恩微笑地说，“你们肯定在书上读到过。我想，党外的人很少能喝到这种酒。”他的脸又严肃起来，他端起酒杯。“我想我们最好先为健康干一杯。为我们的领导，为伊曼纽尔·戈尔施泰因干杯！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He set down the empty glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿急忙端起杯子。葡萄酒他在书本上读到过，也是他梦想喝到的酒。像那块玻璃镇纸或查林顿先生的不完整的歌谣，这属于那个消失了的、浪漫的过去，属于那个他私下喜欢称道的黄金时代。出于某种理由，他总是想象葡萄酒有一种浓烈的甜味，就像黑莓果酱，还有一种很快令人陶醉的效果。实际上，当他喝下酒，又显然觉得失望。事实是，喝了多年的杜松子酒，他几乎没有感觉了。他放下空杯子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted that Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers were known to him already.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥布莱恩在椅子里略微挪了一下，以便面对着温斯顿。他几乎不看朱丽亚，似乎他自然认为温斯顿会讲给她听。他闭了一会儿眼睛。他开始用一种低沉、平淡的声音提问，好像这是例行公事，是一种教义问答，大部分回答他已经知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

I will come back to that presently." He looked at his wrist-watch. "It is unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and you will have to leave separately. You, comrade" -- he bowed his head to Julia -- "will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal. You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions. In general terms, what are you prepared to do?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's Mongolian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned a shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the door silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就像他们在正门时出现的情况一样，小个子的黑眼睛朝他们的脸上扫了一下。他的举动中没有友好的表示。他只是在记住他们的外观，但他对他们没有兴趣，或显得没有兴趣。温斯顿想，一张人工的脸是不会改变表情的。马丁没有说话，也没有打招呼，就走出去，将门悄悄地随手关上。奥布莱恩还在来回溜达，一只手插在黑色外套的口袋里，另一只手拿着香烟。">查看中文翻译</div>

Later I shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which we shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full members of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. I tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When you receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary to communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finally caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will not even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a different person, with a different face."</div>

<div class="line_en">He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease, amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage. "This is unavoidable," his voice seemed to say; "this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again." A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out from Winston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently. O'Brien went on:</div>

<div class="line_en">"You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt you have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others. Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. You will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You will get no comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you will get no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get used to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are the only results that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police there is no other way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们会听到有关兄弟会的传言。无疑，你们对此会有自己的看法。也许，你们想象有为数众多的阴谋分子，他们在地下室秘密集会，在墙上乱涂乱写，通过代称或特殊的手势互相联络。这些都不存在。兄弟会成员无法彼此联络，虽然兄弟会的任何一个成员可能会认出那么几个人的身份。戈尔施泰因本人，如果他落入思想警察之手，也不可能交出兄弟会成员的全部名单，或提供这份名单的全部情况。没有这样一份名单。兄弟会不会被消灭，因为它不是一般意义上的秘密组织。是信念将人们团结在一起，而信念是摧毁不了的。你们没有什么可以获得支撑，除了信念。你们不会从同志那儿得到友谊和鼓励。当你们最终被逮住，你们不会得到帮助。我们从不帮助我们的成员。至多，必要时，某个人会被迫沉默，我们偶尔会把一枚刀片偷偷送进某个囚犯的牢房。你们要习惯生活中没有结果没有希望。你们为组织工作不多久，就会被捕、招供，接着就会死去。那些就是你们唯一能看到的结果。在我们的有生之年不可能有什么变化发生。我们是死人。我们唯一真正的生活是未来。我们作为一把泥土和几根碎骨参与未来。但未来离我们有多远，没有人知道。可能有一千年。眼下除了一点点把神态清醒的人的范围加以扩大，别无其他可能。我们不能集体行动。我们只能将我们的知识传播出去，从个人到个人，一代又一代。面对思想警察，没有其他办法。”">查看中文翻译</div>
