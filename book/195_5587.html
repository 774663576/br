<div class="line_en">Saturday. It was the day on which he had promised to pay his landlady. He had been expecting something to turn up all through the week. He had found no work. He had never been driven to extremities before, and he was so dazed that he did not know what to do. He had at the back of his mind a feeling that the whole thing was a preposterous joke. He had no more than a few coppers left, he had sold all the clothes he could do without; he had some books and one or two odds and ends upon which he might have got a shilling or two, but the landlady was keeping an eye on his comings and goings: he was afraid she would stop him if he took anything more from his room. The only thing was to tell her that he could not pay his bill. He had not the courage. It was the middle of June. The night was fine and warm. He made up his mind to stay out. He walked slowly along the Chelsea Embankment, because the river was restful and quiet, till he was tired, and then sat on a bench and dozed. He did not know how long he slept; he awoke with a start, dreaming that he was being shaken by a policeman and told to move on; but when he opened his eyes he found himself alone. He walked on, he did not know why, and at last came to Chiswick, where he slept again. Presently the hardness of the bench roused him. The night seemed very long. He shivered. He was seized with a sense of his misery; and he did not know what on earth to do: he was ashamed at having slept on the Embankment; it seemed peculiarly humiliating, and he felt his cheeks flush in the darkness. He remembered stories he had heard of those who did and how among them were officers, clergymen, and men who had been to universities: he wondered if he would become one of them, standing in a line to get soup from a charitable institution. It would be much better to commit suicide. He could not go on like that: Lawson would help him when he knew what straits he was in; it was absurd to let his pride prevent him from asking for assistance. He wondered why he had come such a cropper. He had always tried to do what he thought best, and everything had gone wrong. He had helped people when he could, he did not think he had been more selfish than anyone else, it seemed horribly unjust that he should be reduced to such a pass.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was no good thinking about it. He walked on. It was now light: the river was beautiful in the silence, and there was something mysterious in the early day; it was going to be very fine, and the sky, pale in the dawn, was cloudless. He felt very tired, and hunger was gnawing at his entrails, but he could not sit still; he was constantly afraid of being spoken to by a policeman. He dreaded the mortification of that. He felt dirty and wished he could have a wash. At last he found himself at Hampton Court. He felt that if he did not have something to eat he would cry. He chose a cheap eating-house and went in; there was a smell of hot things, and it made him feel slightly sick: he meant to eat something nourishing enough to keep up for the rest of the day, but his stomach revolted at the sight of food. He had a cup of tea and some bread and butter. He remembered then that it was Sunday and he could go to the Athelnys; he thought of the roast beef and the Yorkshire pudding they would eat; but he was fearfully tired and could not face the happy, noisy family. He was feeling morose and wretched. He wanted to be left alone. He made up his mind that he would go into the gardens of the palace and lie down. His bones ached. Perhaps he would find a pump so that he could wash his hands and face and drink something; he was very thirsty; and now that he was no longer hungry he thought with pleasure of the flowers and the lawns and the great leafy trees. He felt that there he could think out better what he must do. He lay on the grass, in the shade, and lit his pipe. For economy's sake he had for a long time confined himself to two pipes a day; he was thankful now that his pouch was full. He did not know what people did when they had no money. Presently he fell asleep. When he awoke it was nearly mid-day, and he thought that soon he must be setting out for London so as to be there in the early morning and answer any advertisements which seemed to promise. He thought of his uncle, who had told him that he would leave him at his death the little he had; Philip did not in the least know how much this was: it could not be more than a few hundred pounds. He wondered whether he could raise money on the reversion. Not without the old man's consent, and that he would never give.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="光想这些有什么用呢？他起身继续往前走。天已经发亮，泰晤士河在微薄的晨光中安静美丽，天色微微泛白，透着某种神秘气息。天空朗而无云，看来会是晴天。他觉得非常疲累，肚肠空荡荡的，饿得咕咕直响，可又不敢在一个地儿坐太久，要时时提防警察过来问话，他唯恐受到这种侮辱。他觉得身上很脏，想洗个澡，兜兜转转就到了汉普顿宫。要是再不吃点东西怕是要饿得涕泪横流，于是便选了一家便宜的小饭馆，走进去。店里升腾起食物的热气，让他有点恶心。他本想吃些有营养的，这样就能撑过一整天，但一看到眼前的食物，胃里竟阵阵作呕。他要了茶和面包黄油，忽然想起今天是礼拜天，可以去阿西尔尼家做客，能吃到那香喷喷的烤牛肉和约克郡布丁。但他现在身心俱疲，无脸面对阿西尔尼幸福、热闹的一家人。他心里郁闷，有苦难言，只想一个人静静，最后决计去汉普顿宫前面的花园找个地方躺会儿。他浑身的骨头又酸又疼，兴许能找到个消防栓弄点水洗把脸，再喝个饱。他口干舌燥，但已经不觉得饿了。想起公园里茂盛的鲜花草坪、郁郁葱葱的参天大树，就不由觉得放松了些。到了那儿一定能更好地想想自己的出路吧。他挑了片凉荫，躺在草坪上，点燃了烟斗。现在为了省钱，一天只能抽两斗烟，就这样忍了好久。不过谢天谢地，烟草袋还是满的。没钱的日子要怎么过啊！他的眼皮开始打架，渐渐沉睡过去。等再睁眼日头已经升到当空，必须马上动身往伦敦市区赶了，这样才能在明天一早赶去那些有望雇佣他的地方问问看。他想起伯伯说的等他死后会留下一小笔遗产，现在还不知道能有多少钱，但最多也就几百镑。不知道能不能提前把这些钱取出来，但没有那个老东西的允许，估计这事是办不成的。想要他松口，比登天还难。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip reckoned his age. The Vicar of Blackstable was well over seventy. He had chronic bronchitis, but many old men had that and lived on indefinitely. Meanwhile something must turn up; Philip could not get away from the feeling that his position was altogether abnormal; people in his particular station did not starve. It was because he could not bring himself to believe in the reality of his experience that he did not give way to utter despair. He made up his mind to borrow half a sovereign from Lawson. He stayed in the garden all day and smoked when he felt very hungry; he did not mean to eat anything until he was setting out again for London: it was a long way and he must keep up his strength for that. He started when the day began to grow cooler, and slept on benches when he was tired. No one disturbed him. He had a wash and brush up, and a shave at Victoria, some tea and bread and butter, and while he was eating this read the advertisement columns of the morning paper. As he looked down them his eye fell upon an announcement asking for a salesman in the `furnishing drapery' department of some well-known stores. He had a curious little sinking of the heart, for with his middle-class prejudices it seemed dreadful to go into a shop; but he shrugged his shoulders, after all what did it matter? and he made up his mind to have a shot at it. He had a queer feeling that by accepting every humiliation, by going out to meet it even, he was forcing the hand of fate. When he presented himself, feeling horribly shy, in the department at nine o'clock he found that many others were there before him. They were of all ages, from boys of sixteen to men of forty; some were talking to one another in undertones, but most were silent; and when he took up his place those around him gave him a look of hostility. He heard one man say:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普算了算他的年纪。这位布莱克斯塔布尔的老牧师已经年过古稀，还得了慢性支气管炎。不过好多得了这种病的老头子都能活一大把年纪。而且，这段时间肯定还会有别的转机发生，菲利普总觉得自己现在的境地很不寻常，和他一样处境的人至少不会饿死。他不肯相信眼下正在经历的是现实，也正因此才没有完全陷入绝望。他下定决心，要找劳森借半英镑。在公园待了一天，饿得实在受不了就抽几口烟，想等到要动身回伦敦了再吃饭，这样的话走着回去才能有力气。天气渐渐凉下来，他出发了，路上走累了就在长凳上小睡一会儿。没人吵醒他。他在维多利亚车站洗脸梳头还刮了刮胡子，买了点面包黄油和一杯茶，一边吃一边读着晨报上的广告栏。他的眼睛往下扫着，目光忽然落到一则招聘启事上。这是一家著名百货公司的装饰织品部招聘售货员。他的心莫名一坠，以中产阶级固有的偏见来看，去百货公司工作是莫大的耻辱。但他耸耸肩膀，这又有什么了不起的呢？干脆做下决定，大胆去试一把。他有种奇怪的感觉，似乎在一次次地接受屈辱，甚至大胆地直面屈辱的过程中，他正逼迫着命运之神向自己低头。上午九点，他红着脸跑到了百货公司，看见前面已经排了长长一队人，有四十多岁的中年男人也有十来岁的小男孩，有些人在压低声音交头接耳，大多数则一声不吭。他站到队伍最后，身旁几个人充满敌意地看了他一眼，其中一个说道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip looked at the assistants. Some were draping chintzes and cretonnes, and others, his neighbour told him were preparing country orders that had come in by post. At about a quarter past nine the buyer arrived. He heard one of the men who were waiting say to another that it was Mr. Gibbons. He was middle-aged, short and corpulent, with a black beard and dark, greasy hair. He had brisk movements and a clever face. He wore a silk hat and a frock coat, the lapel of which was adorned with a white geranium surrounded by leaves. He went into his office, leaving the door open; it was very small and contained only an American roll-desk in the corner, a bookcase, and a cupboard. The men standing outside watched him mechanically take the geranium out of his coat and put it in an ink-pot filled with water. It was against the rules to wear flowers in business.</div>

He could hardly hope to succeed in getting a place the first time he tried.

If he wanted to get anything to eat that day he must go to Lawson's studio before he went out to luncheon, so he made his way along the Brompton Road to Yeoman's Row.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip went to the public baths in Westminster and spent sixpence on a bath. Then he got himself something to eat. He did not know what to do with himself in the afternoon. He would not go back to the hospital in case anyone should ask him questions, and besides, he had nothing to do there now; they would wonder in the two or three departments he had worked in why he did not come, but they must think what they chose, it did not matter: he would not be the first student who had dropped out without warning. He went to the free library, and looked at the papers till they wearied him, then he took out Stevenson's New Arabian Nights; but he found he could not read: the words meant nothing to him, and he continued to brood over his helplessness. He kept on thinking the same things all the time, and the fixity of his thoughts made his head ache. At last, craving for fresh air, he went into the Green Park and lay down on the grass. He thought miserably of his deformity, which made it impossible for him to go to the war. He went to sleep and dreamt that he was suddenly sound of foot and out at the Cape in a regiment of Yeomanry; the pictures he had looked at in the illustrated papers gave materials for his fancy; and he saw himself on the Veldt, in khaki, sitting with other men round a fire at night. When he awoke he found that it was still quite light, and presently he heard Big Ben strike seven. He had twelve hours to get through with nothing to do. He dreaded the interminable night. The sky was overcast and he feared it would rain; he would have to go to a lodging-house where he could get a bed; he had seen them advertised on lamps outside houses in Lambeth: Good Beds sixpence; he had never been inside one, and dreaded the foul smell and the vermin. He made up his mind to stay in the open air if he possibly could. He remained in the park till it was closed and then began to walk about. He was very tired. The thought came to him that an accident would be a piece of luck, so that he could be taken to a hospital and lie there, in a clean bed, for weeks. At midnight he was so hungry that he could not go without food any more, so he went to a coffee stall at Hyde Park Corner and ate a couple of potatoes and had a cup of coffee. Then he walked again. He felt too restless to sleep, and he had a horrible dread of being moved on by the police. He noted that he was beginning to look upon the constable from quite a new angle. This was the third night he had spent out. Now and then he sat on the benches in Piccadilly and towards morning he strolled down to The Embankment. He listened to the striking of Big Ben, marking every quarter of an hour, and reckoned out how long it left till the city woke again. In the morning he spent a few coppers on making himself neat and clean, bought a paper to read the advertisements, and set out once more on the search for work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普去威斯敏斯特的公共澡堂，花六便士洗了个澡，然后买了些吃的。他不知道下午要做什么。不能回医院，生怕别人会来问东问西，再说他现在和医院也再没什么干系了。他之前待过的几个科室里可能有人会纳闷，但这些人一定能各自揣测出答案，并对此深信不疑。至于他们的答案到底是什么，菲利普已经满不在乎了，反正他不是第一个没事先报备就退学的人。他去公共图书馆看了会儿报纸，一直看到昏昏欲睡。拿起一本史蒂文森的《新一千零一夜》，可怎么也读不下去。书里的字干巴巴的，似乎没有任何深意。他不禁又想起自己绝望无助的处境，脑子里翻来覆去只有那么几件事，而其中的一多半又害得他头疼不已。最后，他想呼吸点新鲜空气，便起身走去格林公园，躺在那里的草地上。他想到自己的残疾，苦涩难言。如果不是因为这个，他早就去战场上为国效力了。渐渐地，他迷迷糊糊地睡了过去，梦中自己的脚变得完好无缺，跟着义勇骑兵队进军开普敦。从报纸图片上看到的战场实景给他的想象提供了丰富素材，他穿着一身卡其军装，在夜晚的南非的大草原上与战友围着篝火，席地而坐。睁开眼睛，天还没有黑透，耳畔飘来大本钟敲响的七点的钟声。他依然没有什么事情可做，只得这样无聊地打发掉接下来的十二个钟头。夜晚冗长无尽，让他毛骨悚然。天上阴云沉沉，恐怕有一场大雨要降临。一旦下雨，就不得不去旅馆找个床位住下。他曾在朗伯斯区户外的灯柱上见到过小旅馆的广告：绝佳床位。只要六便士。他从没进过这种旅馆，那刺鼻的臭气、恼人的蚊虫让他打怵。他打定主意，只要天气允许，宁可待在外面也不住旅馆。他一直待到公园关门，然后又漫无目的地在马路上逛荡。他累得浑身都要散架了，巴不得发生点什么事故，就能被送到医院躺着了。那里的床铺起码干干净净，一躺几个礼拜也是好的。午夜时分，他饿得再也走不动了，便跑到海德公园角上的一家咖啡馆，吃了几块烤土豆，喝了杯咖啡。有了点力气后又站起来继续走。他心里焦灼不安，难以入睡，也怕睡在大街上会被警察带走。他发现自己现在看待巡警的角度和以前全然不同了。这是他露宿街头的第三个晚上。他不时坐在皮卡迪利大街旁的长凳休息一会儿，快到天亮的时候慢慢往河堤走去。每过一刻钟，都能听到大本钟敲响一下，默默计算还有多久才能等到这座城市黎明破晓。终于熬到早上，花几个铜币把自己梳洗干净，又买了份报纸浏览广告栏的信息，继续奔波求职。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went on in this way for several days. He had very little food and began to feel weak and ill, so that he had hardly enough energy to go on looking for the work which seemed so desperately hard to find. He was growing used now to the long waiting at the back of a shop on the chance that he would be taken on, and the curt dismissal. He walked to all parts of London in answer to the advertisements, and he came to know by sight men who applied as fruitlessly as himself. One or two tried to make friends with him, but he was too tired and too wretched to accept their advances. He did not go any more to Lawson, because he owed him five shillings. He began to be too dazed to think clearly and ceased very much to care what would happen to him. He cried a good deal. At first he was very angry with himself for this and ashamed, but he found it relieved him, and somehow made him feel less hungry. In the very early morning he suffered a good deal from cold. One night he went into his room to change his linen; he slipped in about three, when he was quite sure everyone would be asleep, and out again at five; he lay on the bed and its softness was enchanting; all his bones ached, and as he lay he revelled in the pleasure of it; it was so delicious that he did not want to go to sleep. He was growing used to want of food and did not feel very hungry, but only weak. Constantly now at the back of his mind was the thought of doing away with himself, but he used all the strength he had not to dwell on it, because he was afraid the temptation would get hold of him so that he would not be able to help himself. He kept on saying to himself that it would be absurd to commit suicide, since something must happen soon; he could not get over the impression that his situation was too preposterous to be taken quite seriously; it was like an illness which must be endured but from which he was bound to recover. Every night he swore that nothing would induce him to put up with such another and determined next morning to write to his uncle, or to Mr. Nixon, the solicitor, or to Lawson; but when the time came he could not bring himself to make the humiliating confession of his utter failure. He did not know how Lawson would take it. In their friendship Lawson had been scatter-brained and he had prided himself on his common sense. He would have to tell the whole history of his folly. He had an uneasy feeling that Lawson, after helping him, would turn the cold shoulder on him. His uncle and the solicitor would of course do something for him, but he dreaded their reproaches. He did not want anyone to reproach him: he clenched his teeth and repeated that what had happened was inevitable just because it had happened. Regret was absurd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一连好几天，情况没有任何改观。他吃得极少，身上开始一点点没了力气，就像要生一场大病。工作本来就极难找，对一个没有力气四处问询的人来说，更是难上加难。他已经习惯了在商店门口等上半天只为谋个店员的工作，也习惯了被三言两语草草打发走。按着招工启事上的地址，他走遍了伦敦的各个角落，练就了一项特殊的本事：一眼就能看出身旁等待面试的人会不会也像他似的白跑一趟。有一两个人想和他交朋友，但他身体疲倦，内心沮丧，实在不愿接受这样的好意。他还欠着劳森五先令，所以没法再去找他。他饿得头晕眼花，脑子里乱成一锅粥，也顾不上将来会发生什么了。这些日子里，他哭了好几场。一开始他还因此生自己的气，觉得特别丢脸，但哭过之后似乎很多情绪都得以释放，而且竟然不觉得肚中饥饿难耐了。天刚刚放亮那阵是一日中最冷的时候，他在寒冷的街头冻得浑身发抖。一天晚上，他偷偷摸回家换内衣。到家的时候大概是半夜三点钟，那时所有人都睡下了。五点钟时，他又悄悄溜了出来。他在自己的床上躺了一会儿，那柔软的被褥像磁石一样紧紧吸住他。身上的每根骨头都酸痛不堪，他沉浸在这张简陋的单人床所带来的舒适幸福之中，滋味之美妙，甚至让人不忍心睡着。饿的时间一久反倒习惯了肚里空空的感觉，此刻只是觉得周身上下没有力气。也想过干脆一了百了，但他竭力不让这个念头在头脑中逗留，怕万一哪天脑子一热禁不住诱惑，可能就真的做了傻事。他不断告诉自己，自杀是最愚蠢的行为。不管遇上什么事，很快就都会有所转机。他依然觉得自己现在的处境荒谬得让人难以严肃对待。就像得了一场病，虽然疼痛难忍，但他知道一定会有痊愈的那天。每个绝望而难熬的夜晚他都暗自发誓再也不能这样苟活下去了，明天一早就要跟伯伯或者尼克松先生、劳森写信求助。但真等天亮了，他又狠不下心来承认自己就是个彻头彻尾的失败者。不知道劳森会怎么看待这件事。在他们两个人里，劳森扮演的是那个糊里糊涂、不长脑子的角色，而他则一直为自己通晓事理的智慧而自豪。如果要向劳森请求帮助，就不得不原原本本地坦白自己干的所有蠢事。他心里很不自在，虽然劳森这次一定会伸出援手，但恐怕从此以后就会离自己远远的了。伯伯和律师当然能为他做些事情，但他又害怕受到责骂。他不想让任何人对自己加以斥责。他咬紧牙关，在心里一遍一遍地说着：但凡发生了的事情，都是无法避免的。后悔才是荒唐的行为。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The days were unending, and the five shillings Lawson had lent him would not last much longer. Philip longed for Sunday to come so that he could go to Athelny's. He did not know what prevented him from going there sooner, except perhaps that he wanted so badly to get through on his own; for Athelny, who had been in straits as desperate, was the only person who could do anything for him. Perhaps after dinner he could bring himself to tell Athelny that he was in difficulties. Philip repeated to himself over and over again what he should say to him. He was dreadfully afraid that Athelny would put him off with airy phrases: that would be so horrible that he wanted to delay as long as possible the putting of him to the test. Philip had lost all confidence in his fellows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这日子像是看不到头，从劳森那借的五先令支撑不了多久了。菲利普盼着礼拜天快点到来，这样就能去阿西尔尼家吃顿饱饭了。他明明可以提前几天过去，可不知道是什么力量在暗中阻拦着他，也许是因为他只想独自一人熬过这痛苦的日子吧。曾经一度走投无路的阿西尔尼似乎是唯一能帮他做点什么的人了。也许吃过饭后，他能鼓起勇气告诉阿西尔尼自己所面临的难处。他一遍遍排练着到时要讲的话，感到惴惴不安，担心阿西尔尼会摆出副怠慢的态度来。这个时候，不过几句风凉话就能彻底摧垮他。他尽可能地把这项“挑战”往后延期。他对自己的朋友失掉了所有信心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Saturday night was cold and raw. Philip suffered horribly. From midday on Saturday till he dragged himself wearily to Athelny's house he ate nothing. He spent his last twopence on Sunday morning on a wash and a brush up in the lavatory at Charing Cross.</div>
