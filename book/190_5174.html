<div class="line_en">A few days later, a visitor arrived in London from Oliver's home town. He was a large, fat man, and very proud of his hat, which showed the world that he was a most important official. It was, in fact, Mr Bumble the beadle, Oliver's old enemy.</div>

He had told him that he would have died of hunger without Fagin's kindness. He went on to tell Oliver the story of another young boy, who had gone to the police to tell them about the gang, but who had finally been hanged one morning for being a thief. Fagin described the hanging in terrifying detail, and said that he hoped he would never have to tell the police about Oliver -- and see Oliver with a rope around his neck.

All the windows were closed, and covered with wood and metal bars that kept out the light.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that evening he was rarely on his own again. He spent a lot of time with the Dodger and Charley, and often played the hand kerchief game with them.

<div class="line_cn" title="从那天晚上起，他很少一个人待着了，总是同神偷和查理在一起，常常同他们做着手帕的游戏。有时，费金给他们讲他年轻时干过的一些盗窃的事。他维妙维肖地说着事情滑稽的细节，奥利弗虽然心里明白这都是坏事，但还是不停地大笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bill Sikes was sitting by his fire with his dog when Fagin entered. The room was a small, dark place with almost no furniture.

He knocked on a door, said something quietly to the person who opened it, then walked upstairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside were two other men, who, at Sikes command, produced food and drink for him and the boy. Then Sikes told Oliver to get some sleep as They would be going out again later that night. Oliver still had no idea of the purpose of this expedition, but his head ached with tiredness and he soon fell asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">At half past one the men got up and checked their equipment, gathering several sticks as well. Sikes and the man called Toby left the house together, with Oliver walking between them. There was now a thick fog and the night was very still as They hurried through the deserted streets of the nearby town. Out in the country again, They walked down several small roads until finally They stopped at a house surrounded by a high wall. As quick as lightning, Toby climbed up and pulled Oliver after him. Inside the garden, They crept towards the house, and now, for the first time, Oliver realized in horror that the purpose of the expedition was robbery, and maybe even murder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差不多一点半，人们就起来了，检查了一下他们的工具，还把几根木棍收集在一起。赛克斯和那个叫托比的人一起离开了这幢房子，奥利弗走在他们两人中间。夜晚雾很大，四周非常安静，他们匆匆地穿行在附近小镇子荒僻的街道上。不久，他们又到了乡间，走完几条小道，最后停在了一座被一道高墙围着的房屋前。比尔闪电般地爬上了墙，随后把奥利弗也拉了上去。到了花园里，他们蹑手蹑脚地向屋子靠近。直到现在，奥利弗才万般惊恐地知道了这次远行的目的是入室盗窃，很有可能还会谋财害命。">查看中文翻译</div>
