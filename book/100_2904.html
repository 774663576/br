In truth, she prefers the atmosphere of her current flat, a pleasant, vaguely Bohemian attic off the Hornsey Road. Belsize Park is just too neat and chi-chi, and despite her best efforts and the gradual colonisation of her books and clothes, Dexter's flat still retains an atmosphere of the bachelor years: the games console, the immense television, the ostentatious bed. "I keep expecting to open a cupboard and be buried under, I don't know… a cascade of panties or something." But he has made the offer, and she feels as if she should offer something in return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又陷入了沉默，收音机适时地发出噪音。爱玛再次闭上眼睛，脑海浮现自己打包衣物、书籍的情景。其实，她更喜欢自己租住的公寓，霍恩西路上朦胧波希米亚风格的宜人阁楼。贝尔塞兹公园太规整造作，她虽已努力地用自己的习惯、物件去影响它，但依旧改变不了德克斯特一贯营造的单身汉公寓的气氛：游戏机、大屏幕电视，豪华的大床。“我一直想象着，打开衣橱，自己就被埋在，怎么说呢…劈头盖脸掉下来的短裤一类的东西中…不过，他既然开了口，她便觉得自己也该有所回应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So in late September, when Paris had finally, finally started to lose some of its gleam, they had travelled back on the train together. With light tans and new clothes they walked arm-in-arm along the platform and it felt like they were arriving in London for the very first time, with plans and projects, resolutions and ambitions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九月底，巴黎终于开始失去光彩，他们坐上了返程火车，雄心勃勃地回到伦敦。两人新衣新气象地挽着胳膊走上月台，仿佛头一次踏上这片土地。这一对赢得了朋友们热情而明智的肯定，仿佛一切早在他们预料之中。爱玛再次被介绍给德克斯特的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The idea was hatched in Paris, during that long strange summer in which they had dismantled his life, then put it back together again. It had been Emma's idea, sitting outside a café near the Parc des Buttes Chaumont in the north-east. "You like food," she had said, "you know about wine. You could sell really good coffee by the pound, imported cheeses, all that swanky stuff that people want these days. Not pretentious or chi-chi, just this really nice little shop, with tables outside in the summer." Initially he had bridled at the word "shop", not quite able to see himself as a "shopkeeper" or, even worse, a grocer. But an "imported food specialist" had a ring to it. Better to think of it as a café/restaurant that also sold food. He would be an entrepreneur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="计划是在巴黎那个漫长奇怪的夏日中酝酿的。当时他们坐在·家咖啡馆，把他的生活分解重组了一番，爱玛便提议说：“你喜欢美食，也懂葡萄洒。可以卖顶级咖啡配进口干酪，一定畅销，时髦的东西大家趋之若鹜。店面装修以简洁雅致为主，夏季霹天摆几张桌子。”起初，他对“店”这个字眼耿耿子怀，无法接受自己成为“店员”，或者更难听点，“杂货商”。不过，“进口食品专家”的称谓可是响亮。小店也成了兼卖食品的咖啡馆。他就能以企业家自居了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their friends nodded sagely, sentimentally, as if they had known it all along. Emma was introduced once again to Dexter's father -- "Of course I remember. You called me a fascist" -- and they put forward the idea of the new business in the hope that he might want to help with the financing. When Alison had died there had been a private understanding that some money might go to Dexter at an appropriate time, and this seemed like the moment. Privately, Stephen Mayhew still expected his son to lose every penny, but that was a small price to pay to know that he would never, ever appear on television ever again. And Emma's presence helped. Dexter's father liked Emma, and for the first time in some years found himself liking his son because of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我当然记得你。你说我是个法西斯呢，”他们提出开店的想法，指望得到经济支持。艾莉森去世之前曾私下允诺，时机成熟时给德克斯特一笔钱，而眼下再合适不过。斯蒂芬·梅休虽然怕儿子会血本无归，不过若他未来不再上电视，则实在可喜可贺。好在有爱玛，她深得德克斯特父亲的喜爱，也让他破天荒爱屋及乌地喜欢儿子了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had found the property together. A video rental shop, already an anomaly with its shelves of dusty VHS, had finally given up the ghost, and, with one last push from Emma, Dexter had made his move and taken the property on a twelve-month lease. Through a long wet January they ripped out the metal shelving and distributed the remaining Steven Seagal videos around local charity shops. They stripped and painted the walls a buttery white, installed dark wooden panelling, scoured other bankrupt restaurants and cafés for a decent industrial coffee machine, chill cabinets, glass-fronted refrigerators; all those failed businesses reminding him of what was at stake, how likely he was to fail.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the first day of spring they sat in the sun on the pavement outside the partly refurbished shop and wrote down a list of possible names: corny combinations of words like magasin, vin, pain, Paris pronounced "Paree", until they settled on Belleville Café, bringing a flavour of the 19th arrondissement to just south of the A1. He formed a limited company, his second after Mayhem TV plc, with Emma as his company secretary and, in a small but significant way, his co-investor. Money was starting to come in from the first two "Julie Criscoll" books, the animated TV series had been commissioned for its second series, there was talk of merchandising: pencil cases, birthday cards, even a monthly magazine. There was no denying it, she was now what her mother would term "well off". After a certain amount of throat-clearing, Emma found herself in the strange, slightly unnerving position of being able to offer Dexter financial help. After a certain amount of foot shuffling, he accepted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开春第一天阳光灿烂，他们坐在正翻新着的小店前的人行道上，开始为它起名字， 想出来的却净是些俗气的词， 比如Magasin， Vin， Pain，①等等，最后终于想到“贝尔韦尔咖啡馆”，让十九世纪巴黎一个行政区的名字现身伦敦A1区的南部。他注册了一家有限公司，是继那家电视公司后他拥有的第二家公司，由爱玛担任秘书。她同时也是合伙投资人，出资不多，意义却不小―—前两部《朱莉·克里斯柯》的版权费。它的改编动画片也已进入第二个系列的创作，并正开发各种推销方案：铅笔盒，生日贺卡，甚至一本月刊。无可否认，她现在的处境，用她母亲的话说就是“阔了”。当时，爱玛清了半天嗓子，还是有点怯生生地提出资助德克斯特的意思。一阵推让后他接受了。【注：①均为法语，分别为“商店”、“葡萄酒”、“面包”之意。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But all the time Emma was there, pushing him on, keeping him convinced that he was doing the right thing. The area was up-and-coming the estate agents said, slowly filling with young professionals who knew the value of the word "artisan" and wanted jars of duck confit, customers who didn't mind paying two pounds for an irregular loaf of bread or a lump of goat's cheese the size of a squash ball. The café would be the kind of place where people came to ostentatiously write their novels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而爱玛始终都在左右，给他坚持下去的信心和勇气。地产中介说，此地会越来越繁华，慢慢吸引年轻在行、追求“纯手工”价值的人，他们爱吃油封鸭，也不介意多花两英镑去买精致的花式面包或是回力球大小的羊奶干酪。此外，咖啡馆还是虚荣的写书人的好去处。">查看中文翻译</div>

If he is famous now it is only locally, and only for his selection of herbal teas, but he's still a mild heartthrob to the flushed young mums-to-be who come in to eat pastries after their pram-ercise class, and in a small way he is almost, almost a success again. He unlocks the heavy padlock that holds down the metal shutters, already hot to the touch on this radiant summer's morning. He pulls them up, unlocks the door and feels, what? Content? Happyish? No, happy. Secretly, and for the first time in many years, he is proud of himself.</div>

By some strange mystery Jasmine is now two and a half years old, self-possessed and beautiful like her mother, and she can come in and play shops and be fussed over by the other staff, and when he gets home tonight Emma will be there. For the first time in many years he is more or less where he wants to be. He has a partner whom he loves and desires and who is also his best friend. He has a beautiful, intelligent daughter.

<div class="line_en">Two miles away, just off the Hornsey Road, Emma climbs the flights of stairs, unlocks the front door and feels the cool, stale air of a flat that has been unoccupied for four days. She makes tea, sits at her desk, turns on her computer, and stares at it for the best part of an hour. There's a lot to do -- scripts for the second series of "Julie Criscoll" to read and approve, five hundred words of the third volume to write, illustrations to work on.

<div class="line_en">But her mind keeps slipping back to Dexter's proposal. During the long, strange summer in Paris last year they had made certain resolutions about their future together -- if in fact they did have a future together -- and central to the scheme was that they would not live together: separate lives, separate flats, separate friends. They would endeavour to be together, and faithful of course, but not in any conventional way. No traipsing around estate agents at the weekend, no joint dinner parties, no Valentine's Day flowers, none of the paraphernalia of coupledom or domesticity. Both of them had tried it, neither had succeeded.</div>

<div class="line_en">They have spoken about it before, in a roundabout facetious way, and he has made noises about maybe, in the future, when things are a little bit more settled. But how much more settled can things be? The subject sits there in the middle of the room and they keep walking into it. It's there every time her parents telephone, it's there every time she and Dexter make love (less frequently now than in the debauch of the flat in Paris, but still often enough). It keeps her awake at night. Sometimes it seems that she can chart her life by what she worries about at three a. m. Once it was boys, then for too long it was money, then career, then her relationship with Ian, then her infidelity. Now it is this. She is thirty-six years old, a child is what she wants, and if he doesn't want it too, then perhaps they had better…</div>

<div class="line_en">After a distracted morning of time-wasting, Emma goes for a lunch-time swim, ploughing up and down the lanes yet still unable to clear her head. Then with her hair still wet she cycles back to Dexter's flat and arrives to find an immense, vaguely sinister black 4x4 waiting outside the house. It's a gangsters' car, two silhouettes visible against the windscreen, one broad and short, the other tall and slim; Sylvie and Callum, both gesticu lating wildly in the middle of another argument. Even from across the road Emma can hear them, and as she wheels her bike closer she can see Callum's snarled face, and Jasmine in the back seat, eyes fixed on a picture book in an attempt to filter out the noise. Emma taps the window nearest Jasmine and sees her look up and grin, tiny white teeth in a wide mouth, straining forwards against her seatbelt to get out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Through the car window, Emma and Callum nod. There's something of the playground about the etiquette of infidelity, separation and divorce, but allegiances have been declared, enmities sworn, and despite having known him for nearly twenty years Emma must no longer talk directly to Callum. As for the ex-wife, Sylvie and Emma have settled on a tone, self-consciously bright and grudge-free, but even so dislike shimmers between them like a heat haze.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, whenever she sees her ex-husband he is smiling, smiling away advertising his happiness like the member of some cult. He throws Jasmine in the air, gives her piggybacks, displays at every opportunity what a wonderful dad he has become. And this Emma person too, all Jasmine talks about is Emma-this and Emma-that and how Emma is her daughter's best, best friend. She brings home pieces of pasta glued to coloured card and when Sylvie asks what it is, she says it's Emma, then chatters on and on about how they went to the zoo together. They have a family pass, apparently. God, the insufferable smugness of the pair of them, Dex and Em, Em and Dex, him with his chintzy little corner shop -- Callum has forty-eight branches of Natural Stuff now, by the way -- and her with her push-bike and thickening waist, her studenty demeanour and wry bloody outlook.

He barks absurd slogans at her: "Quid pro quo, Jasmine, quid pro quo." She's two and a half, for goodness" sake.
