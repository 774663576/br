<div class="line_en">Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle. The front door had remained un locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood.</div>

No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book… a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard."</div>

I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“伏地魔对这个魂器的大意让我感到大大的不祥。这意味着他很可能已经做成——或计划要做更多的魂器，所以失去一个不会那么危险。我不愿相信这一点，但似乎没有其他解释可以说得通。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it -- as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很对，”邓布利多点点头说，“但你有没有想到，哈利，如果他希望日记被传递给或植根于某个未来的霍格沃茨学生，那他对里面宝贵的灵魂碎片可是非常不当心的。正如斯拉格霍恩教授所说，魂器的用途，是把自己的一部分灵魂安全地封存起来，而不是扔到别人的路上去冒被消灭的危险——这实际上发生了：那一片灵魂已不复存在，这你看到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality." That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody!' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I don't believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil'…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must lie drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependant on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see… or as close to immortal as any man can be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“长生不老药确实能延长生命，但必须经常喝，永远喝下去，才能保持不死。那样，伏地魔将完全依赖此药。如果药用完了或受到污染，或是魔法石被盗，他就会像其他人一样死去。伏地魔喜欢单独行动，记得吗？我相信他会觉得依赖是不可容忍的，哪怕是依赖长生不老药。当然，为了摆脱他在袭击你之后那种半生半死的可怕状态，他愿意喝它，但那只是为了重获肉体。之后，我相信他还是打算继续依靠他的魂器：他不再需要别的，只要能重获一个人身。他已经长生不死了……或者说比任何人都更接近长生不死。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It seem that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他似乎在利用特别重要的谋杀来制作魂器，你当然是这样一个目标。他相信如果杀了你，他就消灭了预言所提示的危险。他相信这样他就天下无敌了。我想他一定是打算用你的死来做他的最后一个魂器。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemorts mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们知道，他失败了。但隔了几年之后，他用纳吉尼杀死了一个麻瓜老头，也许他就是那时想到了把这条蛇变成他的最后一个魂器的。它可以突出斯莱特林的家世，增加伏地魔的神秘性。我想这可能是他最喜欢的东西了。他无疑喜欢把它带在身边，而且似乎对它有异乎寻常的支配力，这即使在蛇佬腔中也是罕见的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss… but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常有趣的问题，哈利。我想不会。因为伏地魔现在罪恶太深，而他的这些重要部分又分离得太久，我相信他的感觉不如我们了。也许在临死时，他才会感觉到损失……像那本日记被毁的时候他就没有察觉，后来才从卢修斯·马尔福口中逼问出来。我听说，当伏地魔发现日记被摧毁并失去了所有魔力之后，曾经大发雷霆，非常可怕。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his masters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius… what with Voldemorts fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，那是多年以前，伏地魔确信自己可以制造多个魂器的时候。但卢修斯仍要等伏地魔的许可才能行动，他没有等到，因为伏地魔交托日记后不久便消失了。他无疑认为卢修斯对魂器除了小心看护之外不敢做任何事。但他过于依靠卢修斯对主人的畏惧了——要知道这个主人已失踪多年并被卢修斯认为已经死亡了。当然，卢修斯不知道那本日记实际上是什么。我想伏地魔只会跟他说日记被施了巧妙的魔法，能使密室重新打开。如果卢修斯知道他手里捧了主人的一片灵魂，一定会对它更加尊敬一些——但事实是，他为了自己的目的执行了老计划：把日记安置在亚瑟·韦斯莱的女儿身上。他希望以此败坏亚瑟的名声，把我赶出霍格沃茨，同时除掉一件非常容易惹祸的物证。啊，可怜的卢修斯……出于私心丢掉魂器而触怒了伏地魔，去年在魔法部又是那样的惨败，如果他此刻暗自庆幸能在阿兹卡班苟且偷安，我是不会奇怪的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is essential that you understand this!" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. "By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须明白这一点！”邓布利多站了起来，在屋子里大步地走来走去，闪亮的袍子在身后呼呼飘动。哈利还从没见他这么激动过，“在企图杀你的时候，伏地魔就亲自选出了坐在我面前的这个卓越的人，并为他提供了工具！你能看到伏地魔的思想、野心，甚至能听懂他发令时那蛇说话般的语言，这都只能怪他自己。可是，哈利，尽管你能洞察伏地魔的世界——要知道，这是任何食死徒不惜用杀人来换取的能力，但你却从未接受黑魔法的诱惑，从未显露过丝毫想要追随伏地魔的欲望，一秒钟都没有！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!"</div>
