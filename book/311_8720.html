<div class="line_en">Her dad only had seven dollars in his wallet, so that's what he gave her. When he was ready to take her home, she said she had to go the bathroom. She went up to the hall closet, found three brand new toothbrushes and shoved them into the front of her pants, along with a bar of Dove soap. Donna might have seen her (she was right there in the bedroom), but she didn't say anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸钱包里只剩七美元，所以就给她这么多。他要送埃莉诺回家时，她说得去浴室一趟。她直奔走道的橱柜，找到三把全新的牙刷，塞到前裤袋里，还塞了一块多芬香皂。唐娜或许看见了（她就在卧室），但是没说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor wished she had a phone to call the cops. "There's a guy driving around the Flats with a bunch of kids hanging out of a convertible. I'm pretty sure none of them have seat belts on and that he's been drinking Scotch all morning. Oh, and while you're here, there's another guy in the backyard smoking hash. In a school zone."</div>

<div class="line_en">When their dad finally left, Mouse couldn't stop talking about him. After a few hours, Richie told everybody to put their coats on. "We're going to a movie," he said, looking right at Eleanor. "All of us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她爸爸终于走后，鼠鼠还一直在说他。几个小时后，雷奇叫他们穿上外套，说：“我们去看电影。都去。”他眼睛直瞪着埃莉诺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Huh, Eleanor thought. I'm not fantasizing about being thrown from a moving vehicle. Weird.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was snowing on the way home from the movie. (Short Circuit.) Richie drove slow, which meant that even more snow fell on them, but at least nobody flew out of the truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看完电影《霹雳五号》，回家的路上下雪了，雷奇开得很慢，这意味着有更多的雪落在他们身上，但至少他们没从车上摔出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor and the little kids climbed into the back of the truck and huddled against the cab, making faces at the baby, who got to sit inside. Richie drove down Park's street on the way out of the neighborhood, but Park wasn't outside, thank God. Of course, Tina and her Neanderthal boyfriend were out. Eleanor didn't even try to duck. What was the point? Steve whistled at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺和孩子们爬上货车的后车厢，挤靠着车厢板，对坐在最中间的小婴儿挤眉弄眼。雷奇开出小区时，经过帕克的家，帕克没在外头，感谢老天。提娜跟她那个尼安德特人男朋友站在门外，埃莉诺根本就懒得躲。有什么用呢？史蒂夫朝她吹了个口哨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He ran across the yard because he didn't feel like putting on a coat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他快步跑过院子，没穿外套。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he hadn't meant to tell her like that. So soon. And over the phone. Especially knowing how she felt about Romeo and Juliet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Park was waiting for his little brother to change clothes. Every Sunday, they got dressed up, in nice pants and sweaters, and had dinner with their grandparents. But Josh was playing Super Mario and wouldn't turn it off. (He was about to get to the infinity turtle for the first time.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克在等弟弟换衣服。每个星期天，他们都会盛装，换上好裤子和毛衣，跟爷爷奶奶共进晚餐。但是乔许还在玩“超级玛丽”，不肯关机。（他快要碰上那个可以无限加命的乌龟了，这还是第一次。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His grandparents' house smelled like chicken-fried chicken. His grandma only had four Sunday dinners in her repertoire -- chicken-fried chicken, chicken-fried steak, pot roast and corned beef -- but they were all good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爷爷奶奶的房子传来鸡排的味道。他奶奶只有四种周日晚餐：鸡排、牛排、炖锅、盐渍牛肉。每样都很好吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His grandpa was watching TV in the living room. Park stopped to give him half a hug, then went into the kitchen and hugged his grandma. She was so small, even Park towered over her. All the women in his family were tiny, and all the men were huge. Only Park's DNA had missed the memo. Maybe the Korean genes scrambled everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爷爷在起居室看电视，帕克走过去，随意抱了抱他，就走进厨房拥抱奶奶。奶奶个头非常小，就连帕克都比她高了整整一个头。他家的女性都身材纤小，男性则都十分魁梧。只有帕克的基因被漏写在备忘录里。或许是韩国基因搞乱了一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their grandmother looked nothing but Irish. Or maybe Park only thought that because everyone in his dad's family made such a big deal about being Irish. Park got a "Kiss Me, I'm Irish" T-shirt every year for Christmas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶奶则是彻彻底底的爱尔兰人。或许这只是帕克的错误想法，因为爸爸的家族对爱尔兰血统非常自豪。每年圣诞节，帕克都会收到一模一样的T恤，写着“吻我，我是爱尔兰人”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He set his grandparents' table without being asked, because it had always been his job. When his mom got there, he hung out in the kitchen with her and his grandma, and listened to them gossip about the neighbors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不用奶奶开口，他就主动帮忙摆碗筷，这是他的工作。妈妈到了后，帕克就待在厨房，听她跟奶奶闲聊邻里家常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It shouldn't surprise Park that his dad had already told his grandma. His dad could never keep a secret.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I heard from Jamie that Park's going steady with one of those kids who live over with Richie Trout," his grandma said.</div>

<div class="line_en">That didn't explain Josh's hugeness, though. Josh looked like the Korean genes had skipped him altogether. His eyes were brown and just barely almondy -- almond-flavored. And his hair was dark, but not even close to black. Josh looked like a big German or Polish kid whose eyes kind of crinkled when he smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是乔许又高又大，好像韩国基因完全跳过了他的身体。他的眼睛是棕色的，有点丹凤眼。发色虽暗，却完全不是黑色。他看起来像壮硕的德国或者波兰小孩，笑起来眼角微微眯起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, my heart goes out to any child living in that house," his grandma said. "That Trout boy has never been any good. He smashed out our mailbox while your dad was in the service. I know it was him because he was the only one in the neighborhood with an El Camino. He grew up in that little house, you know, until his parents moved someplace even more redneck than here. Wyoming, I think it was. They probably moved to get away from him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他奶奶说：“我真是可怜住在那屋里的孩子啊。那个曹特啊，从来就不是好孩子。你爸爸还在当兵时，他曾弄坏我们家的信箱。我知道是他，因为全小区只有他开艾尔卡米诺车。他就出生在那栋小房子里，直到他父母搬去更乡下的地方，好像是怀俄明州吧，应该是。他们说不定是为了逃离他才搬家的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
