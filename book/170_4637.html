<div class="line_en">The guards marched Davos Seaworth across a bridge of black basalt and under an iron portcullis showing signs of rust. Beyond lay a deep salt moat and a drawbridge supported by a pair of massive chains. Green waters surged below, sending up plumes of spray to smash against the foundations of the castle. Then came a second gatehouse, larger than the first, its stones bearded with green algae. Davos stumbled across a muddy yard with his hands bound at the wrists. A cold rain stung his eyes. The guards prodded him up the steps, into Breakwater's cavernous stone keep.</div>

<div class="line_en">They found the lord alone in the gloom of his hall, making a supper of beer and bread and sister's stew. Twenty iron sconces were mounted along his thick stone walls, but only four held torches, and none of them was lit. Two fat tallow candles gave a meagre, flickering light. Davos could hear the rain lashing at the walls, and a steady dripping where the roof had sprung a leak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们发现领主大人正独自坐在昏暗的大厅里，享用着啤酒、面包和姐妹炖菜构成的晚餐。在他四周厚重的石墙上安着二十只铁烛台，但只有四只上面插着火把，而且还没点着。两根粗大的牛油蜡烛发出微弱、闪烁的烛光，戴佛斯能听到雨点敲打墙壁的声音，屋顶上一处裂隙不停地漏下雨水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once inside, the captain removed his cloak and hung it from a peg, so as not to leave puddles on the threadbare Myrish carpet. Davos did the same, fumbling at the clasp with his bound hands. He had not forgotten the courtesies he had learned on Dragonstone during his years of service.</div>

<div class="line_en">"M'lord," said the captain, "we found this man in the Belly o' the Whale, trying to buy his way off island. He had twelve dragons on him, and this thing too." The captain put it on the table by the lord: a wide ribbon of black velvet trimmed with cloth-of-gold, and bearing three seals; a crowned stag stamped in golden beeswax, a flaming heart in red, a hand in white.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大人，”卫兵队长说，“我们在鲸腹湾发现的这个人，他正试图悬赏招人帮他离岛。他身上带着十二枚金龙，还有这个东西。”队长把它放在领主面前的桌上：一根镶金边的黑天鹅绒宽绶带，上面饰有三枚纹章——铭刻在金色蜜蜡中的一头宝冠雄鹿，一颗燃烧的红心，一只白手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davos waited wet and dripping, his wrists chafing where the wet rope dug into his skin. One word from this lord and he would soon be hanging from the Gallows Gate of Sisterton, but at least he was out of the rain, with solid stone beneath his feet in place of a heaving deck. He was soaked and sore and haggard, worn thin by grief and betrayal, and sick to death of storms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯像只落水狗一样站那等着。他的手腕被淋湿的绳子勒得紧紧的，已经磨破了。这位大人只要说一句话，他就会立刻被吊在姐妹镇[*1]的城楼下，但至少他不会再挨雨淋了，脚下是坚固的岩石而不再是颠簸起伏的甲板。他已经被淋得透湿，肌肉酸痛，憔悴不堪，被悲痛和背叛折磨得麻木了，也受够了这该死的暴风雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lord wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and picked up the ribbon for a closer squint. Lightning flashed outside, making the arrow loops blaze blue and white for half a heartbeat. One, two, three, four, Davos counted, before the thunder came. When it quieted, he listened to the dripping, and the duller roar beneath his feet, where the waves were smashing against Breakwater's huge stone arches and swirling through its dungeons. He might well end up down there, fettered to a wet stone floor and left to drown when the tide came rushing in. No, he tried to tell himself, a smuggler might die that way, but not a King's Hand. I'm worth more if he sells me to his queen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="领主大人用手背擦了擦嘴，抓起绶带凑近了观瞧。外面亮起闪电，蓝白的光芒交替闪烁了片刻。一，二，三，四，戴佛斯默数着，接着雷声传来。雷声沉寂之后，他听到雨水落下的声音，还有沉闷的轰鸣声从脚下传来，那是海浪拍打着破浪堡的巨型石拱门，打着旋穿过下面的地牢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lord leaned back. "Cut him free," he said, "and peel those gloves off him. I want to see his hands."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位大人直起了身子，“给他松绑，”他说，“脱下他的手套，我要看看他的手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lord fingered the ribbon, frowning at the seals. He was an ugly man, big and fleshy, with an oarsman's thick shoulders and no neck. Coarse grey stubble, going white in patches, covered his cheeks and chin. Above a massive shelf of brow he was bald. His nose was lumpy and red with broken veins, his lips thick, and he had a sort of webbing between the three middle fingers of his right hand. Davos had heard that some of the lords of the Three Sisters had webbed hands and feet, but he had always put that down as just another sailor's story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位大人抚摸着绶带，冲着印章皱起了眉头。他是个相貌丑陋的家伙，身材巨大而肥胖，长了一副桨手般宽厚的肩膀，没有脖子。粗糙的已经半白的灰色胡茬盖满了他的双颊和下巴。宽大的脑门上是他已经秃了的头顶。酒糟鼻子和厚厚的嘴唇，他右手中间的三根手指间好像长着蹼。戴佛斯曾听说过有些三姐妹岛的领主有着长蹼的手和脚，但他总把那当作是天方夜谭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have been called that, my lord." Davos was a lord himself, and had been a knight for long years now, but deep down he was still what he had always been, a smuggler of common birth who had bought his knighthood with a hold of onions and salt fish. "I have been called worse things too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的确被这样称呼，大人。”戴佛斯自己也是个领主，而且很多年前就成为骑士了，但在内心深处他依旧没有改变，一个平民出身的走私犯，凭着走私的洋葱和咸鱼赢来了他的爵位。“我还有被起过更糟的外号。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain did as he was told. As he jerked up his captive's maimed left hand the lightning flashed again, throwing the shadow of Davos Seaworth's shortened fingers across the blunt and brutal face of Godric Borrell, Lord of Sweetsister. "Any man can steal a ribbon," the lord said, "but those fingers do not lie. You are the onion knight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卫兵队长照他的吩咐做了。当他揪起他的俘虏伤残的左手时恰好闪电再次亮起，把戴佛斯·席渥斯三根被削短的手指的影子投在在甜蜜姐妹岛的领主古德里克·伯莱尔那张生硬而残酷的脸上。“谁都能偷来一根绶带，”那位大人说，“但那些手指不会撒谎。你就是洋葱骑士。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“除非史坦尼斯真的是个国王。”那位大人用严厉的黑色眼睛打量着他。“差不多所有来到我岛上的骑士都要到我的大厅里来拜见我，而不是呆在鲸腹湾。那地方是个可耻的走私贩子的老窝。你是又干回你的老本行了吗，洋葱骑士？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you are in the wrong place, with the wrong lord." Lord Godric seemed amused. "This is Sisterton, on Sweetsister."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know it is." There was nothing sweet about Sisterton, though. It was a vile town, a sty, small and mean and rank with the odors of pig shit and rotting fish. Davos remembered it well from his smuggling days. The Three Sisters had been a favorite haunt of smugglers for hundreds of years, and a pirate's nest before that. Sisterton's streets were mud and planks, its houses daub-and-wattle hovels roofed with straw, and by the Gallows Gate there were always hanged men with their entrails dangling out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道这是哪。”尽管姐妹镇可没什么甜蜜而言。它是个令人厌恶的镇子，肮脏，狭小，破旧，到处飘荡着猪粪和烂鱼的臭味。从他走私的时候，戴佛斯就对那气味难以忘怀。几百年来三姐妹岛一直是走私贩子最爱出没的地方，在那之前它是海盗的巢穴。姐妹镇的大街铺的是泥巴和木板，它的房子都茅草搭成的屋顶、用涂上泥巴的篱笆围成的小屋。城门楼上总是悬挂着肠子在外面飘荡的犯人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have friends here, I do not doubt," said the lord. "Every smuggler has friends on the Sisters. Some of them are my friends as well. The ones who aren't, them I hang. I let them strangle slowly, with their guts slapping up against their knees." The hall grew bright again, as lightning lit the windows. Two heartbeats later came the thunder. "If it is White Harbor that you want, why are you in Sisterton? What brought you here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不怀疑你在这有朋友。”那位大人说，“每个走私贩子在姐妹岛上都有朋友。他们中有些还是我的朋友。不是我的朋友的，我会掏出他们的肠子，把他们吊起来，让他们慢慢窒息而死。”闪电照亮的窗户，使得大厅再次明亮起来。两个心跳之后雷声传来。“如果你要去的是白港，为什么你会在姐妹镇？是什么把你带到这里的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nine-and-twenty ships had set sail from the Wall. If half of them were still afloat, Davos would be shocked. Black skies, bitter winds, and lashing rains had hounded them all the way down the coast. The galleys Oledo and Old Mother's Son had been driven onto the rocks of Skagos, the isle of unicorns and cannibals where even the Blind Bastard had feared to land; the great cog Saathos Saan had foundered off the Grey Cliffs. "Stannis will be paying for them," Salladhor Saan had fumed. "He will be paying for them with good gold, every one." It was as if some angry god was exacting payment for their easy voyage north, when they had ridden a steady southerly from Dragonstone to the Wall. Another gale had ripped away the rigging of the Bountiful Harvest, forcing Salla to have her taken under tow. Ten leagues north of Widow's Watch the seas rose again, slamming the Harvest into one of the galleys towing her and sinking both. The rest of the Lysene fleet had been scattered across the narrow sea. Some would straggle into one port or another. Others would never be seen again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二十九艘船从长城出海。如果它们中的一半还在漂着，戴佛斯都会感到惊讶。阴沉的天空，凛冽的寒风，不停抽打在身上的雨水，在沿着海岸南下的一路上一直陪伴着他们。平底船“奥莱杜”号和“老母之子”号撞上了史卡格斯岛的礁石，那是独角兽和食人族盘踞之岛，就连“瞎眼杂种”号都不敢在那靠岸；“萨索斯·桑恩”号大货船在灰崖沉没了。“史坦尼斯要对此作出赔偿，”萨拉多·桑恩怒气冲冲地说，“他得为这些船赔上足够的金子，每条都要赔。”这仿佛是某个恼怒的神灵在索取之前他们顺风顺水地从龙石岛航行到长城的补偿。另一场狂风撕碎了“丰收”号的帆索，迫使萨拉不得不拖着她前行。在寡妇望以北十里格，海上又起了风暴，掀起了“丰收”号撞上一条正拖拽着她的平底船，最终一起沉入海底。里斯舰队剩下的船只已经被吹散在狭海各处，一些可能还会挣扎着靠上某个港口，另一些可能再也看不到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos had tried to persuade him to stay true. If Salla abandoned Stannis and his cause, he pointed out, he abandoned all hope of collecting the gold that was due him. A victorious King Tommen was not like to pay his defeated uncle's debts, after all. Salla's only hope was to remain loyal to Stannis Baratheon until he won the Iron Throne. Elsewise he would never see a groat of his money. He had to be patient.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯想试图说服他认清现实。如果萨拉抛弃了史坦尼斯和他的事业，戴佛斯指出，那也就抛弃了所有拿回他应得的金子的希望。毕竟，获胜的国王托曼可不会替他被击败的叔叔还债。萨拉唯一的希望就是继续对史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩保持忠诚，直到他赢得铁王座。否则他一个子儿也别想拿到。他不得不保持耐心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Salladhor the Beggar, that's what your king has made me," Salladhor Saan complained to Davos, as the remnants of his fleet limped across the Bite. "Salladhor the Smashed. Where are my ships? And my gold, where is all the gold that I was promised?" When Davos had tried to assure him that he would have his payment, Salla had erupted. "When, when? On the morrow, on the new moon, when the red comet comes again? He is promising me gold and gems, always promising, but this gold I have not seen. I have his word, he is saying, oh yes, his royal word, he writes it down. Can Salladhor Saan eat the king's word? Can he quench his thirst with parchments and waxy seals?

<div class="line_en">Perhaps some lord with honey on his tongue might have swayed the Lysene pirate prince, but Davos was an onion knight, and his words had only provoked Salla to fresh outrage. "On Dragonstone I was patient," he said, "when the red woman burned wooden gods and screaming men. All the long way to the Wall I was patient. At Eastwatch I was patient… and cold, so very cold. Bah, I say. Bah to your patience, and bah to your king. My men are hungry. They are wishing to fuck their wives again, to count their sons, to see the Stepstones and the pleasure gardens of Lys.

<div class="line_en">Because he is your rightful king, Davos thought. Because he is a strong man and a just one, the only man who can restore the realm and defend it against the peril that gathers in the north. Because he has a magic sword that glows with the light of the sun. The words caught in his throat. None of them would sway the Lord of Sweetsister. None of them would get him a foot closer to White Harbor. What answer does he want? Must I promise him gold we do not have? A highborn husband for his daughter's daughter? Lands, honors, titles? Lord Alester Florent had tried to play that game, and the king had burned him for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为他是你合法的国王，戴佛斯想。因为他是个坚定而公正的男人，唯有他才能平定这个国家，抵御正在北方汇聚的种种威胁。因为他有一把能散发太阳一样光芒的魔剑。这些话涌到了嘴边。但这些话无法打动甜蜜姐妹岛的领主，无法让他更靠近白港一步。他想要的什么样的答案？我要向他许诺我们根本没有的金子吗？一位许给他外孙女的出身高贵的丈夫？土地，荣誉，爵位？艾利斯特·佛罗伦大人曾经试过这种游戏，而国王为此烧了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos understood. He nurses doubts. He does not want to find himself upon the losing side. "Stannis held Storm's End against the Tyrells and the Redwynes. He took Dragonstone from the last Targaryens. He smashed the Iron Fleet off Fair Isle. This child king will not prevail against him."</div>

<div class="line_en">"At the dawn of Robert's Rebellion. The Mad King had sent to the Eyrie for Stark's head, but Jon Arryn sent him back defiance. Gulltown stayed loyal to the throne, though. To get home and call his banners, Stark had to cross the mountains to the Fingers and find a fisherman to carry him across the Bite. A storm caught them on the way. The fisherman drowned, but his daughter got Stark to the Sisters before the boat went down. They say he left her with a bag of silver and a bastard in her belly. Jon Snow, she named him, after Arryn.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Be that as it may. My father sat where I sit now when Lord Eddard came to Sisterton. Our maester urged us to send Stark's head to Aerys, to prove our loyalty. It would have meant a rich reward. The Mad King was open-handed with them as pleased him. By then we knew that Jon Arryn had taken Gulltown, though. Robert was the first man to gain the wall, and slew Marq Grafton with his own hand. 'This Baratheon is fearless,' I said. 'He fights the way a king should fight.' Our maester chuckled at me and told us that Prince Rhaegar was certain to defeat this rebel. That was when Stark said, 'In this world only winter is certain. We may lose our heads, it's true… but what if we prevail?' My father sent him on his way with his head still on his shoulders. 'If you lose,' he told Lord Eddard, 'you were never here.'"</div>
