<div class="line_en">This was Mrs. Hodges, a little woman of five-and-forty, with badly dyed hair; she had a yellow face with a network of small red veins all over it, and yellow whites to her pale blue eyes. She took a fancy to Philip and called him by his Christian name before he had been in the shop a week.</div>

She used to pick her teeth with the pin of an enormous silver brooch. It was in the form of a whip and a hunting-crop crossed, with two spurs in the middle.</div>

<div class="line_en">She introduced him to Miss Bennett, who was the belle of Lynn's. She was the buyer in the `Petticoats,' and when Philip entered was engaged in conversation with the buyer in the `Gentlemen's Hosiery;' Miss Bennett was a woman of massive proportions, with a very large red face heavily powdered and a bust of imposing dimensions; her flaxen hair was arranged with elaboration. She was overdressed, but not badly dressed, in black with a high collar, and she wore black glace gloves, in which she played cards; she had several heavy gold chains round her neck, bangles on her wrists, and circular photograph pendants, one being of Queen Alexandra; she carried a black satin bag and chewed Sen-sens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把菲利普介绍给班内特小姐。班内特是女士衬裙部的主管、林恩百货公司出了名的美人儿。可菲利普一进门就碰上了男袜部主管，一直被他缠着聊天。班内特小姐长得人高马大，宽宽的脸盘儿红彤彤的，搽了不少脂粉，身材玲珑有致，肥臀丰乳，亚麻色的头发梳理得很精致。她穿着高领外套，一身黑衣，黑色的皮手套油亮亮的，打牌的时候也一直戴在手上。虽然这身打扮有点太过隆重，但好在还不算难看。脖子上戴了几条粗粗的金链，手腕上套着好几个镯子，还有画着图案的圆形吊坠，其中一个画的是亚历山德拉王后。她背着一个黑色的丝绸小包，嘴里嚼着糖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never you mind what they say, dear," said Mrs. Hodges. "I've 'ad to go through it same as you 'ave. They don't know any better, poor things. You take my word for it, they'll like you all right if you 'old your own same as I 'ave."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“千万别把她们的话当真，亲爱的，”霍奇斯夫人说，“我过去也没少受人指指点点。是她们没见识，那群可怜人儿啊。你记住我的话，只要能像我这样坚持下来，她们早晚会喜欢你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was ill at ease in his new surroundings, and the girls in the shop called him `sidey.' One addressed him as Phil, and he did not answer because he had not the least idea that she was speaking to him; so she tossed her head, saying he was a `stuck-up thing,' and next time with ironical emphasis called him Mister Carey. She was a Miss Jewell, and she was going to marry a doctor. The other girls had never seen him, but they said he must be a gentleman as he gave her such lovely presents.</div>

<div class="line_en">Those who were going to take part in the social evening came in, the younger members of the staff mostly, boys who had not girls of their own, and girls who had not yet found anyone to walk with. Several of the young gentlemen wore lounge suits with white evening ties and red silk handkerchiefs; they were going to perform, and they had a busy, abstracted air; some were self-confident, but others were nervous, and they watched their public with an anxious eye. Presently a girl with a great deal of hair sat at the piano and ran her hands noisily across the keyboard. When the audience had settled itself she looked round and gave the name of her piece.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a round of clapping during which she deftly fixed bells to her wrists. She smiled a little and immediately burst into energetic melody. There was a great deal more clapping when she finished, and when this was over, as an encore, she gave a piece which imitated the sea; there were little trills to represent the lapping waves and thundering chords, with the loud pedal down, to suggest a storm. After this a gentleman sang a song called Bid me Good-bye, and as an encore obliged with Sing me to Sleep. The audience measured their enthusiasm with a nice discrimination. Everyone was applauded till he gave an encore, and so that there might be no jealousy no one was applauded more than anyone else. Miss Bennett sailed up to Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="观众爆发出热烈的掌声，她趁大家都在鼓掌，熟练地往手腕上系了几个铃铛，微微一笑，激烈的音符便随之奏响。一曲终了，台下的掌声更响了些。待安静下来，她又返场弹了一首依照大海浪声改编而成的曲子。细微的颤音代表浪花轻拍海面，雷鸣般的和弦配合重重踩下的踏板，让人仿佛听到暴风雨的降临。接下来出场的是位男士，演唱了一曲《向我道别》，之后又返场唱了首《哄我入眠》。该表现出什么程度的热情，观众心里自有分寸。每个人演出完他们都要不停鼓掌，一直到演员返场为止。这样所有演员都能表演两次，谁也用不着嫉妒谁。班内特小姐朝菲利普翩翩走来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The buyer in the `gentleman's hosiery' was a well-known reciter, and he was called upon loudly to perform by all the assistants in his department. Needing no pressing, he gave a long poem of tragic character, in which he rolled his eyes, put his hand on his chest, and acted as though he were in great agony. The point, that he had eaten cucumber for supper, was divulged in the last line and was greeted with laughter, a little forced because everyone knew the poem well, but loud and long. Miss Bennett did not sing, play, or recite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男袜部的主管特别擅长诵诗，他部里的员工纷纷起哄，大喊着让他表演一段。他痛痛快快地走上台子，吟诵了一首悲戚万分的长诗。他的眼珠转来转去，手捂住胸口，做出一副痛苦不堪的表情。一直念到诗的最后一句，大家才知道原来诗人之所以这么悲伤，都是因为晚饭只吃了根黄瓜。虽然这首诗已经被表演了无数遍，可大家还是非常配合地在最后爆发出热烈的笑声，久久不停。班内特小姐既不弹琴唱歌，也不表演朗诵。">查看中文翻译</div>

The girl who had played the accompaniments sat at the piano and placed a decided foot on the loud pedal. She played a dreamy waltz, marking the time with the bass, while with the right hand she `tiddled' in alternate octaves. By way of a change she crossed her hands and played the air in the bass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了一会儿，一个打扮英俊时髦的年轻人提议说，要想跳舞的话最好现在就开始。负责伴奏的女孩坐到钢琴前，把脚放到踏板上，弹了一曲流畅动人的华尔兹舞曲。她用低音打着拍子，右手轮换弹着八度音阶，偶尔还换个法子，两手交叉在低音区弹上一段。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Bennett liked dancing and poetry better than anything in the world. She danced well, but very, very slowly, and an expression came into her eyes as though her thoughts were far, far away. She talked breathlessly of the floor and the heat and the supper. She said that the Portman Rooms had the best floor in London and she always liked the dances there; they were very select, and she couldn't bear dancing with all sorts of men you didn't know anything about; why, you might be exposing yourself to you didn't know what all. Nearly all the people danced very well, and they enjoyed themselves. Sweat poured down their faces, and the very high collars of the young men grew limp.</div>
