<div class="line_en">Theranos touted the herpes test approval as proof that its technology worked, but I remained deeply skeptical. In laboratory parlance, the herpes test was a qualitative test. Such tests provided simple yes-or-no answers to the question of whether a person had a certain disease. They were technically much easier to get right than quantitative tests designed to measure the precise amount of an analyte in the blood. Most routine blood tests were quantitative ones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Theranos大肆吹捧疱疹病毒检验的核准足以证明其技术是可行的，不过我仍然深感怀疑。以实验室术语来说，疱疹病毒检验是一种「定性试验」（qualitative test），这类检验是提供简单的「是」和「否」结果，来判定受测者是否罹患某种疾病，就技术层面而言，这种检验比「定量试验」（quantitative test）容易很多，因为定量检验必须精准量测出某待测物质在血液里的含量，而一般的血液检验大多是定量检验。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The early days of July 2015 brought two pieces of good news for Theranos. The first was that the FDA had approved the company's proprietary finger-stick test for HSV-1, one of two strains of herpes virus. The second was that a new law Arizona had passed allowing its citizens to get their blood tested without a doctor's order -- a bill Theranos had practically written itself and heavily lobbied for -- was about to go into effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一五年七月稍早，Theranos迎来两个好消息。首先，FDA通过其独门的手指检测用於单纯疱疹病毒一型（HSV—1，两种疱疹病毒株之一）；第二，亚利桑那州通过的新法即将开始生效，州民不需医师开检验单即可接受血液检验——这项法案几乎是Theranos一手撰写并大力游说通过的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I called a source of mine who was high up in the FDA's medical-device division. He confirmed my thinking. The herpes test approval was a one-off clearance that was in no way a blanket endorsement of Theranos's technology, he said. In fact, the clinical data the company had submitted to the agency for a number of its other finger-stick tests were poor and wouldn't pass muster, he added. When in turn I told him about the things I had learned in the course of my reporting, ranging from Theranos's practice of running diluted finger-stick samples on commercial analyzers to its gaming of proficiency testing and the questionable test results some doctors and patients had received, he sounded disturbed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打电话给任职于FDA医疗设备部门高层的线人，他证实了我的想法。他说，那个疱疹病毒检验只是一次性核准，不等于全面替Theranos技术背书。他还说，事实上，Theranos送交FDA的其他手指检测数据都很糟糕，未达到FDA的标准。接着换我把调查过程得知的事告诉他，包括Theranos先稀释手指样本再放进商用分析仪检验、在能力测试动手脚，以及有些医生和病人收到的检测报告有问题。他听起来很焦虑不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Part of the problem was that, three years after Holmes's clash with the now-retired Lieutenant Colonel David Shoemaker, Theranos continued to operate in a regulatory no-man's-land. By using its proprietary devices only within the walls of its own laboratory and not seeking to commercialize them, it was able to continue to avoid close FDA scrutiny. At the same time, it gave the appearance of cooperating with the agency by publicly supporting its drive to regulate laboratory-developed tests and voluntarily submitting some of its own LDTs, like the herpes test, to it for approval.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麻烦的是，自从霍姆斯跟现在已退休的中校大卫．休梅克发生冲突后，这三年来Theranos持续在监管单位的三不管地带运作，只要它的独家设备只用于自家实验室的四堵墙内，不寻求商业化上市，它就能继续回避FDA的严密监督。同时，Theranos又摆出很配合FDA的姿态，公开支持FDA把LDT（实验室自行研发的检验），纳入规范的努力，并且主动将自己的LDT（譬如疱疹病毒检验）送交FDA核准。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over at fortune, Roger Parloff had a different take on the herpes test approval than I did. In an article he published on the magazine's website, he wrote that it was "a strong endorsement of the integrity of" Theranos's methods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在《财星》杂志那边，罗杰．帕洛夫对疱疹病毒检验通过核准有迥异于我的解读。他在一篇刊登于《财星》网站的文章中写道，那是对Theranos的方法「完整性做出强力背书」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My source said it was hard for the agency to take any adverse action against a company that portrayed itself as the lab world's biggest advocate of FDA regulation, especially one as politically connected as Theranos. At first, I thought he was referring to its board of directors, but that was the least of his concerns. He pointed out how chummy Holmes had gotten with the Obama administration. He had seen her at the launch of the president's precision medicine initiative earlier in the year, one of several White House appearances she'd made in recent months. The latest had been a state dinner in honor of Japan's prime minister, where she was photographed in a body-hugging black gown on the arm of her brother. Despite all this, his parting words made me think Theranos might not be able to fool the FDA much longer: "I'm very concerned about what they're doing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位线人说，对于一家把自己形塑成全世界最竭力拥护FDA规范的公司，FDA很难采取任何对它不利的行动，更何况它是一家政治人脉如此丰沛的公司。一开始我以为他说的是Theranos董事会，后来才知道在他看来董事会那些只是小咖，他指的是霍姆斯跟欧巴马政府的麻吉程度。那年稍早，他亲眼看到霍姆斯出席欧巴马总统启动精准医疗计划的场合，那还只是她最近几个月参与的几个白宫活动之一，最近一次是一场为日本首相举办的国宴，她被拍到穿着黑色贴身晚礼服、挽着弟弟的手出席。尽管如此，他最后一句话给我感觉，Theranos可能没办法愚弄FDA太久了：「我非常关心他们现在在做什么。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During a phone interview Holmes granted him for this second article, Parloff inquired about an Ebola test Theranos had in the works. George Shultz had made a passing mention of it at a conference a few months earlier. Given that an Ebola epidemic had been raging in West Africa for more than a year, Parloff thought a rapid finger-stick test to detect the deadly virus could be of great use to public health authorities and had been interested in writing about it. Holmes said she expected to obtain emergency-use authorization for the test shortly and invited him to come see a live demonstration of it at Boies Schiller's Manhattan offices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那篇文章是在霍姆斯首肯下透过电话采访写成，帕洛夫在电话中问起Theranos正在研发的伊波拉病毒检验（这件事是几个月前乔治．舒兹在一场会议不经意提到的），由于伊波拉疫情在西非已肆虐超过一年，帕洛夫心想，用快速的手指检验来侦测这种致命病毒对公卫当局应该很有帮助，因此一直很有兴趣撰写这个报导。霍姆斯回答，她预计很快就能取得伊波拉病毒检验的紧急使用授权（emergency-use authorization），还邀请帕洛夫到BSF事务所位于曼哈顿的办公室，去看看现场检验示范。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few days later, Parloff arrived at the law firm and was greeted by Dan Edlin, one of Christian Holmes's Duke fraternity brothers. Edlin showed him to a conference room where two black Theranos devices had been set up side by side (they were miniLabs, not Edisons). For reasons Parloff didn't understand, Holmes had wanted the demo to include a potassium test too (no doubt because I had been asking tough questions about that particular test). So Edlin drew blood from Parloff's finger twice. One machine would perform the Ebola test and the other the potassium test, he explained. Parloff wondered fleetingly why one of the devices couldn't simultaneously perform both tests from a single blood sample but decided not to press the issue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，帕洛夫来到BSF事务所，迎接他的人是丹．艾德林，克利斯勤．霍姆斯的杜克兄弟帮之一。艾德林把他带到会议室，里头已经排放好两台黑色设备（这两台是迷你实验室，不是爱迪生）。霍姆斯要求这次示范要连同钾检验一起做，帕洛夫不知道原因何在（想必是因为我一直针对钾检验提出尖锐问题），所以艾德林从帕洛夫的指尖抽了两次血，他解释一台机器做伊波拉病毒检验，另一台做钾检验。帕洛夫脑袋里快速闪过一丝不解，为什么不是用同一份血液样本，在同一台设备上同时做两种检验？不过，他决定还是不要追问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Parloff and Edlin made small talk while they waited for the test results. After about twenty-five minutes, the tests still hadn't been completed. Edlin said it was because the devices had just been installed and needed to warm up. The tests' progress was represented by the darkening edge of a circle on the devices' digital screens, like app downloads on an iPhone. Inside the circle, a percentage number told the user how much of the test had been completed. Based on how slowly the edge of one of the circles was filling up, it looked to Parloff like it might take several more hours. He couldn't wait around that long. He told Edlin he needed to head back to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等待检验结果出炉时，帕洛夫和艾德林在一旁闲话家常。过了二十五分钟左右，检验仍然还没完成，艾德林说因为设备才刚装好需要热机。设备上的数字屏幕有个圆圈，圆圈会逐渐变黑，以此显示检验进度，就像iPhone下载app一样，圆圈里有个百分比数字，显示检验已完成多少比例。从圆圈变黑的速度如此缓慢的情况看来，帕洛夫觉得可能还要等上好几个小时，他无法等那么久，于是告诉艾德林自己必须回去工作了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Parloff left, Kyle Logan, the young chemical engineer who had won an academic award at Stanford named after Channing Robertson, entered the conference room. He'd flown in with Edlin on the red-eye from San Francisco that morning and was there to provide technical support. Noticing that the miniLab running the potassium test was stuck at 70 percent completion, he took the cartridge out and rebooted the machine. He had a pretty good idea what had happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕洛夫前脚刚离开，凯尔．罗根（在斯坦福获得钱宁．罗伯森学术奖项的年轻化学工程师）后脚就走进实验室，他是跟艾德林一起从旧金山搭乘红眼班机在清晨抵达的，目的是提供技术支持。他注意到，运行钾检验的那台迷你实验室在完成七〇％时卡住了，于是他取出卡匣，重新启动机器。他很清楚刚刚到底发生了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the absence of real validation data, Holmes used these demos to convince board members, prospective investors, and journalists that the miniLab was a finished, working product. Michael Craig's app wasn't the only subterfuge used to maintain the illusion. During demos at headquarters, employees would make a show of placing the finger-stick sample of a visiting VIP in the miniLab, wait until the visitor had left the room, and then take the sample out and bring it to a lab associate, who would run it on one of the modified commercial analyzers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在缺乏实际确效数据的情况下，霍姆斯用这种展示方式来说服董事、潜在投资人、新闻记者相信迷你实验室是可行的完成品。为了维持这个假象，他们所动用的伎俩可不只是麦可．克雷格的应用程序。在总部进行展示时，员工会做做样子把来访贵宾的手指样本放进迷你实验室，等到访客不耐久候离开，他们就会取出样本，交给实验室同仁拿去用改装后的商用分析仪做检验。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Balwani had tasked a Theranos software engineer named Michael Craig to write an application for the miniLab's software that masked test malfunctions. When something went wrong inside the machine, the app kicked in and prevented an error message from appearing on the digital display. Instead, the screen showed the test's progress slowing to a crawl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="包汪尼要求Theranos一位名叫麦可．克雷格（Michael Craig）的软件工程师，为迷你实验室写了一个应用程序，用来掩饰检验失灵。机器内部如果出现什么毛病，那个应用程序就会启动，这时候数字屏幕不会出现「消息有误」的字样，而是会出现检验进度缓慢如牛步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This is exactly what had happened with Parloff's potassium test. Luckily, enough of the test had occurred before the malfunction that Kyle was able to retrieve a result from the machine. The breakdown had happened while the device was running the test again on the control part of the sample. Normally, it would have been preferable to have the initial result confirmed by the control, but Daniel Young told Kyle over the phone that it was OK to do without it in this case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕洛夫的钾检验就是如此，幸好，这次检验在故障发生前已经完成一定程度，所以凯尔能从机器截取到检验结果。这次故障是发生于机器进行二次检验时，也就是对照组检验的时候，正常来说，最好第一次的结果有经过对照组的检验确认无误，不过丹尼尔．杨在电话中告诉凯尔，这次没有对照组也没关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

Holmes had invited Vice President Joe Biden to come visit Theranos's Newark facility, which was now home to both Theranos's clinical laboratory and its miniLab manufacturing operations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在加州这头，霍姆斯和包汪尼正在为一场更大规模的「秀图说故事」预做准备。霍姆斯邀请副总统拜登（Joe Biden）来参观Theranos的纽华克厂区（Theranos现在把临床实验室和迷你实验室生产线都迁到那里）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was an audacious move given that, since Alan Beam's departure in December 2014, the lab had been operating without a real director. To keep this hidden, Balwani had recruited a dermatologist named Sunil Dhawan to replace Beam on the lab's CLIA license. Although Dhawan had no degree or board certification in pathology, he technically met state and federal requirements because he was a medical doctor and had overseen a little lab affiliated with his dermatology practice that analyzed skin samples. The reality, however, was that he was unqualified to run a full-fledged clinical lab. Not that it mattered. Balwani only intended him to be a figurehead. Some lab employees in Newark never saw Dhawan in the building.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邀请副总统参观是很大胆冒险的举动，因为自从二〇一四年十二月艾伦．毕姆离开后，实验室就一直没有真正的主管。为了掩盖这个事实，包汪尼聘请皮肤科医生苏尼尔．达万（Sunil Dhawan），来取代实验室的CLIA证照上所挂的艾伦．毕姆名字。达万虽然没有病理学的学位或证照，但是技术上来说，他是符合州政府和联邦政府规定的，因为他是医生，也管理过一家小实验室（那家实验室附属于他服务的皮肤科诊所，负责分析皮肤样本），但是他其实不够格掌管一家完整规模的临床实验室，不过没关系，包汪尼只是请他来当人头而已，纽华克实验室里有些员工根本没看过他出现在那栋大楼。">查看中文翻译</div>

Since most of the miniLabs that had been built were in Palo Alto, they had to be transported back across the bay for the stunt.

<div class="line_en">A few days later, on July 28, I opened that morning's edition of the Journal and nearly spit out my coffee: as I was leafing through the paper's first section, I stumbled across an op-ed written by Elizabeth Holmes crowing about Theranos's herpes-test approval and calling for all lab tests to be reviewed by the FDA. She'd been denying me an interview for months, her lawyers had been stonewalling and threatening my sources, and here she was using my own newspaper's opinion pages to perpetuate the myth that she was regulators' best friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，七月二十八日，我打开那天早上的《华尔街日报》，嘴里的咖啡差点喷出来。我快速翻阅头版时，意外看到社论对页版（op-ed）的特稿是伊莉莎白．霍姆斯所写，她得意夸耀Theranos的疱疹病毒检验通过核准，并且呼吁所有实验室检验一起接受FDA审核。几个月来她一再拒绝接受我的采访，她的律师一再阻碍、威胁我的线人，而现在她竟然利用我自家报社的意见版面，延续她是监管单位好朋友的神话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During the roundtable discussion, Biden called what he had just seen "the laboratory of the future." He also praised Holmes for proactively cooperating with the FDA. "I know the FDA recently completed favorable reviews of your innovative device," he said. "The fact that you're voluntarily submitting all of your tests to the FDA demonstrates your confidence in what you're doing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圆桌论坛讨论中，拜登把他刚刚所见称为「未来实验室」，他还夸赞霍姆斯主动积极配合FDA，他说：「我知道FDA最近刚对你的创新设备做出正面评价，你主动把所有检验送交FDA，由此可证，你对自己所做的事充满信心。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because of the firewall between the Journal's news and editorial sides, Paul Gigot and his staff had no idea I was working on a big investigative piece about the company. So I couldn't blame them for publishing whatever they saw fit. But I was annoyed. I suspected Holmes was trying to use the positive editorial-page coverage to make it more difficult for the paper to publish my investigation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《华尔街日报》的新闻和社论中间设有防火墙，社论主编保罗．吉高和他的同仁并不知道我正在对Theranos进行大调查，所以我不能苛责他们刊登他们认为合适的文章，但是我很火大。我猜想，霍姆斯是企图用社论版面的正面报导，来增加本报刊登我的调查报导的难度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had filed a draft of my story a week earlier and decided to walk over to my editor's office to see where he stood with his edit. Once he was done with it, the story would be sent to the paper's page-one editor, who would assign it to someone on his team for a second, closer edit. Then the standards editor and the lawyers would comb through it line by line. It was a slow process that often took weeks and sometimes months. I wanted to speed it up. The longer we took to publish, the more time we gave Theranos to turn my sources.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个星期前，我已经交出报导初稿，我决定到主编办公室看看他的编辑工作进行到哪里了。只要他一完成，报导就会送到头版主编那里，他会分派给他团队某个人进行第二次更严谨的编辑，新闻规范编辑和律师会逐行逐句爬梳内容，这整个过程很缓慢耗时，通常要花好几个星期，有时甚至几个月。我希望能加快速度，出刊时间拖愈久，等于给Theranos愈多时间去策反我的线人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the meantime, Alan Beam was coming under renewed pressure from Boies's henchmen. They were threatening to report him for violations of HIPAA, the federal health privacy law, on the grounds that some of the emails he had forwarded to his Gmail account before resigning contained patient information. His new lawyer had to fend them off from London, where he was on vacation with his wife. Balwani was also beginning to harass some of the patients I had talked to, insisting that they get on the phone with him and giving them the third degree when they did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同一时间，艾伦．毕姆遭受到波伊斯的爪牙新一波压力。他们威胁要举报他违反《健康保险便携性及责任法案》（HIPAA，联邦医疗隐私法），理由是他离职前转寄到Gmail信箱的几封信含有病患数据。他新聘的律师正跟太太在伦敦度假，必须一边旅行一边抽空抵挡他们的攻势。包汪尼也开始骚扰我采访过的病人，坚持要他们跟他通电话，等到一通上话就开始严词拷问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike cautioned patience. This story was a bombshell and we needed to make sure it was bulletproof when we went to press with it, he said. Mike was of Italian American heritage and he loved using Italian metaphors. I had heard him tell the story of his ancestor Prince Siconulf, who ruled the region surrounding the Amalfi Coast in the ninth century, about ten times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可告诫我要有耐心，他说这篇报导是个震撼弹，我们必须确保注销时是子弹穿不透的。麦可是意大利裔美国人，很喜欢使用意大利比喻，我听他讲祖先西科诺菲王子的故事（Prince Siconulf，他在第九世纪统治阿玛菲海岸［Amalfi Coast］周围一带），大概不下十次了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mike Siconolfi was his usual cheerful self when I popped my head into his office. He motioned for me to sit down. I told him I felt we should move faster. There was no telling what Theranos and Boies would try next. I pointed out Holmes's op-ed and Biden's ballyhooed visit to Theranos's Newark facility a few days earlier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把头探进主编麦可．西科诺菲的办公室，他还是一如往常的好心情。他示意我坐下。我告诉他，我觉得动作应该要更快一点，很难说Theranos和波伊斯接下来会玩什么把戏。我把霍姆斯登在社论的文章告诉他，还有几天前拜登到Theranos纽华克厂区的敲锣打鼓之行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He explained that la mattanza was an ancient Sicilian ritual in which fishermen waded into the Mediterranean Sea up to their waist with clubs and spears and then stood still for hours on end until the fish no longer noticed their presence. Eventually, when enough fish had gathered around them, someone gave an imperceptible signal and in a split second the scene went from preternatural quiet to gory bloodbath as the fishermen struck viciously at their unsuspecting quarry. What we were doing was the journalistic version of la mattanza, Mike said. We were patiently lying in wait until we were ready to publish and then, at some time of our choosing, we would strike. As he said this, he mimicked a Sicilian fisherman violently wielding his spear, which made me laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他解释，「拉曼塔恩沙」是意大利西西里岛一种古老仪式，渔夫涉水走进地中海水深及腰处，手上拿着棍棒和鱼叉，一动也不动地站在那里连续几个小时，一直到鱼儿不再注意他们的存在，等身边聚集的鱼够多了，其中一个渔夫会发出极为微弱的信号，不到一秒钟，原本平静得很诡异的画面，会突然变成血淋淋的大屠杀，渔夫们凶狠地把手中鱼叉刺向他们毫无防备的猎物。麦可说，现在我们做的事就是新闻版的「拉曼塔恩沙」。我们需要耐心地潜伏等待，等候我们做好刊登的准备，然后就在选定的时刻出手攻击。他一面说着，一面模仿西西里岛渔夫凶猛地挥舞手上鱼叉，逗得我们两人哈哈大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I told him that I was on board with the mattanza approach as long as the story ran before Holmes's appearance at the Journal's annual technology conference in Laguna Beach in October. I had recently gotten wind that she was on the conference's list of guest speakers and felt that it would put the paper in an impossible position if my article hadn't been published by then. Mike agreed. The conference was two and a half months away. That gave us ample time, he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我告诉他，我认同「拉曼塔恩沙」的方法，前提是，这篇报导必须抢先霍姆斯现身《华尔街日报》十月在拉古纳海滩（Laguna Beach）举行的科技年会之前。我刚听说她名列那场大会的演说人名单，如果我的文章在那之后才刊出，恐怕会使《华尔街日报》落入一个很难面对的处境。麦可同意我的想法，距离那场会议还有两个半月，我们的时间还很充分，他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
