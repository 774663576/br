<div class="line_en">The summer Lydia fell in the lake, the summer Marilyn went missing: all of them had tried to forget it. They did not talk about it; they never mentioned it. But it lingered, like a bad smell. It had suffused them so deeply it could never wash out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every morning, James called the police. Did they need more photographs of Marilyn? Was there any more information he could give? Were there any more people he could call? By mid-May, when Marilyn had been gone for two weeks, the officer in charge of the case told him, gently, "Mr. Lee, we appreciate all the help you've provided. And we're keeping an eye out for the car. I can't promise we'll find anything, though. Your wife took clothes with her. She packed suitcases. She took her keys." Officer Fiske, even then, hated to give out false hopes. "This kind of thing happens sometimes. Sometimes people are just too different." He did not say mixed, or interracial, or mismatched, but he didn't have to. James heard it anyway, and he would remember Officer Fiske very clearly, even a decade later.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lydia and Nath remembered it this way: weeks passed and their mother was still gone. At recess the other children whispered and teachers gave them pitying looks and it was a relief when school finally ended. After that their father stayed in his study and let them watch television all day, from Mighty Mouse and Underdog in the morning to I've Got a Secret late at night. When Lydia asked, once, what he did in the study, he sighed and said, "Oh, I just putter around." She thought of her father wearing soft rubber shoes and taking small steps on the smooth floor: putter putter putter. "It means reading books and things, stupid," Nath said, and the soft rubber shoes turned into her father's plain brown ones with the fraying laces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉迪亚和内斯的记忆是这样的：几周过去了，母亲依旧杳无音讯。课间休息时，别的孩子在一旁窃窃私语，老师们向他俩投去同情的目光，直到暑假来临，他们才得以放松。暑假期间，父亲自己每天待在书房，让他们在外面看电视，从早晨的《太空飞鼠》和《超狗任务》一直看到深夜播出的《我有一个秘密》，一看就是一整天。有一次，莉迪亚问父亲在书房干什么。他叹息一声，说：“噢，闲荡。”她仿佛听到父亲穿着软橡胶底鞋在光滑的地板上溜达的声音，啪嗒、啪嗒、啪嗒。“闲荡的意思是读读书什么的，蠢货。”内斯说。于是，莉迪亚想象中的软橡胶底鞋变成了父亲的棕色平纹鞋，配着灰色的鞋带。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What James actually did, each morning, was take a small envelope from his breast pocket. After the police had gone that first night with a snapshot of Marilyn and assurances they'd do all they could, after he had scooped the children up and tucked them in bed with their clothes still on, he had noticed the shredded scraps of paper in the bedroom wastebasket. One by one he plucked them from the cotton balls, the old newspapers, the tissues smudged with his wife's lipsticked kiss. He had pieced them together on the kitchen table, matching torn edge to torn edge. I always had one kind of life in mind and things have turned out very differently. The bottom half of the sheet was blank, but he hadn't stopped until every fragment was placed. She had not even signed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，詹姆斯到底在做什么呢？每天早晨，他都要从前胸口袋里拿出一个小信封。玛丽琳失踪当晚，警察拿走了她的一张照片，承诺说他们会尽力寻找，然后，詹姆斯把孩子们赶上楼去睡觉——连衣服都忘了让他们脱。接着，他发现卧室的废纸篓里有一些撕碎的纸片，他从棉花球、旧报纸和玛丽琳擦拭唇膏的纸巾里面，把碎纸片全都挑拣出来，拼在一起。我头脑里总是憧憬着另一种生活，但实际情况却事与愿违。那张字条的下半部分是空白的，但詹姆斯也把这部分拼好了，他发现她甚至都没有署名。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He read the note over and over, staring at the tiny cracks of wood grain snaking between the patches of white, until the sky outside shifted from navy to gray. Then he slipped the scraps of paper into an envelope. Every day -- though he promised himself this time would be the last time -- he settled Nath and Lydia in front of the television, locked the door to his study, and pulled out the shreds of note again. He read it while the children moved from cartoons to soap operas to game shows, while they sprawled, unsmiling, in front of Bewitched and Let's Make a Deal and To Tell the Truth, while -- despite Johnny Carson's best zingers -- they sank into sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把字条读了一遍又一遍，对着纸片拼缝间露出的桌面木纹发呆，直到天色从藏蓝变为深灰。然后，他把这堆纸片塞进一个信封。每天——虽然他总是向自己保证说，这是最后一次了——他都会把内斯和莉迪亚放在电视机前，关上书房的门，拿出那堆纸片。孩子们看动画片、肥皂剧和竞技节目的时候，他就闷在那里读字条。内斯和莉迪亚无精打采、面无表情地看着《家有仙妻》《交易》和《真相》——妙语如珠的约翰尼·卡森也没法让他们振作——逐渐陷入沉睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had married, he and Marilyn had agreed to forget about the past. They would start a new life together, the two of them, with no looking back. With Marilyn gone, James broke that pact again and again. Each time he read the note, he thought of her mother, who had never referred to him by name, only indirectly -- to Marilyn -- as your fiancé. Whose voice he had heard on their wedding day, echoing out into the marble lobby of the courthouse like an announcement on the P. A. system, so loud heads had turned: It's not right, Marilyn. You know it's not right. Who had wanted Marilyn to marry someone more like her. Who had never called them again after their wedding. All this must have come back to Marilyn as she ate at her mother's table and slept in her mother's bed: what a mistake she'd made, marrying him. How her mother had been right all along. I have kept all these feelings inside me for a long time, but now, after being in my mother's house again, I think of her and realize I cannot put them aside any longer. In kindergarten, he had learned how to make a bruise stop hurting: you pressed it over and over with your thumb. The first time it hurt so much your eyes watered. The second time it hurt a little less. The tenth time, it was barely an ache. So he read the note again and again. He remembered everything he could: Marilyn kneeling to lace Nath's sneaker; Marilyn lifting his collar to slide in the stays. Marilyn as she was that first day in his office: slender and serious and so focused that he didn't dare look at those eyes directly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结婚的时候，詹姆斯和玛丽琳曾经约定，忘记过去，共同开启新的生活，别再回头看。而玛丽琳离家出走期间，詹姆斯却一再毁约。每当他拿起字条，就会想起玛丽琳的母亲——她从没叫过他的名字，只是间接地对玛丽琳称呼他“你的未婚夫”。婚礼那天，她母亲的声音在法院大楼的大理石前厅回响，如公众广播一样清晰可闻：“这样不对，玛丽琳。你知道这样不对。”她希望玛丽琳和一个“更像她”的人结婚。婚礼之后，她母亲就再没有给他们打过电话。詹姆斯想，当玛丽琳回到母亲家，在她的桌边吃饭、在她的床上睡觉时，她一定觉得后悔了：她犯了多么大的一个错误，嫁给了他，而她母亲一直是对的。我的这些感受在心底压抑了很久，但是现在，重新造访我母亲的屋子之后，我想到了她，意识到我再也不能继续压抑下去了。上幼儿园的时候，他就学会了如何让挫伤的地方不再疼痛：用拇指不断按压。第一次按下去，你能疼出眼泪。第二次，疼痛略有减轻。第十次，就几乎感觉不到疼了。因此，他不停地读这张字条，竭力回想过往的种种：玛丽琳跪在地上给内斯系鞋带；玛丽琳翻起他的衣领，插入领撑；玛丽琳第一次走进他的办公室，柔弱，严肃，神情专注，当时的他甚至不敢直视她的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he heard the station's late-night sign-off and the national anthem begin to play, he would slip the scraps of Marilyn's note into the envelope and tuck it back into his shirt pocket. Then he tiptoed into the living room, where the children lay curled up together on the floor by the sofa, illuminated by the test pattern on the television. The Indian at the top of the screen glared as James carried first Lydia, then Nath, to bed. Then -- because, without Marilyn, the bed felt too empty, like a barren plateau -- he returned to the living room, swaddling himself in an old crocheted afghan on the sofa and studying the circles on the screen until the signal cut off. In the morning, it all began again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Each morning Lydia and Nath, finding themselves back in their beds, wondered for just a moment if the universe had righted itself: perhaps they might enter the kitchen and find their mother at the stove, waiting for them with love and kisses and hard-boiled eggs. Neither ever mentioned this most tender hope, but each morning, when they met in the kitchen and found no one there but their father, in rumpled pajamas, setting out two empty bowls, they looked at each other and knew. Still gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">They tried to keep busy, trading the marshmallows from their cereal to make breakfast last as long as they could: a pink for an orange, two yellows for a green. At lunchtime, their father made sandwiches, but he never got it right -- not enough peanut butter, or not enough jelly, or cut crosswise instead of in triangles like their mother would have. Lydia and Nath, suddenly tactful, said nothing, even at dinner, when there would be peanut butter and jelly again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们试图逃避到游戏之中，尽可能地延长早餐的时间——比如交换麦片里掺的棉花糖，一颗粉色的换一颗橙色的，两颗黄色的换一颗绿色的。吃午饭时，他们的父亲会做三明治，但永远做得不好——要么是花生酱没有抹足，要么是果酱不够，或者切成四个方形，而不是像他们的母亲那样切成三角形。虽然如此，莉迪亚和内斯却一下子变得狡猾起来，他们什么都不说，甚至当晚餐桌上再次出现花生酱和果酱时，也听不到他们的抱怨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="艾伦夫人凝视着他们，但两个孩子不约而同地扭过头，不去看她。她的嘴唇太薄，牙齿太白。莉迪亚的鞋后跟上粘着一块泡泡糖，像胶水一样把鞋底牢牢黏在地面上。就算得到允许，她想，自己也跑不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You two be good now, and your mother will be home soon, isn't that right?" Mrs. Allen said. She shifted her thin-lipped smile to James, who didn't meet her eye.

He was tired of staying inside in the stale air, tired of the television, tired of his sister, who more and more stared glassy-eyed at the screen in silence. What was there to say? Their mother's absence gnawed at them quietly, a dull and spreading hurt. One morning in early June, when Lydia nodded off during a commercial break, he tiptoed toward the front door. Their father had told them not to leave the house, but the porch steps, he decided, were still the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the far end of the street, Jack perched on his own porch railing, chin propped on bent-up knees. Ever since that day at the pool, Nath had not spoken to Jack, not even hi. When they got off the school bus together, Nath tugged at the straps of his bookbag, walking home as fast as he could. At recess, if he saw Jack coming toward him, he ran to the other side of the playground. It was starting to be a habit, disliking Jack. Now, though, as Jack turned his head and spotted him and bounded down the street, Nath stayed put. Talking to anyone -- even Jack -- was better than more silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, a few days later, the most wonderful distraction arrived -- for Nath, at least. One morning Nath turned on the television, but there were no cartoons. There was Walter Cronkite, serene at his desk just as if he were doing the evening news -- but it was barely eight A. M., and his desk stood outside, the Cape Kennedy wind ruffling his papers and his hair. A rocket stood poised on the launchpad behind him; at the bottom of the screen, a countdown clock ticked. It was the launch of Gemini 9. Had Nath known the word, he would have thought: surreal. When the rocket shot upward in a billow of sulfur-colored smoke, he crept so close to the television that his nose smudged the glass. The counters on the bottom of the screen showed impossible numbers: seven thousand miles an hour, nine thousand, ten. He had not known anything could fly so high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，电视观众们迎来了一项奇妙的消遣——至少对内斯而言是这样。一天上午，内斯打开电视，发现没播动画片。这时，沃尔特·克朗凯特出现在屏幕上，他沉静地坐在桌边，像是在主持晚间新闻——然而当时还不到上午八点，而且，他的桌子摆在室外，肯尼迪角的风吹乱了桌上的文件和他的头发。他身后的发射架上竖立着一枚火箭，电视屏幕的顶端，有一只倒计时的钟表。等待发射的是“双子座九号”。如果当时内斯知道“超现实”这个词，肯定会用它来形容这些电视画面给他的感觉。看到火箭向上发射时喷出的硫黄色巨大烟尘，他缓缓爬到电视旁，鼻子几乎贴在了屏幕上。屏幕底部的计数器变换跳跃，显示出一串匪夷所思的数字：七千英里每小时、九千英里每小时、一万英里每小时。他根本想象不出什么东西会飞得如此之高。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All morning Nath absorbed the news reports, savoring each new term like a fancy bonbon: Rendezvous. Orbital map. Lydia curled up on the sofa and went to sleep while, all afternoon, Nath repeated Gemini. Gemini. GEM-in-i. Like a magic spell. Long after the rocket faded into blue, the camera stayed trained on the sky, on the fading plume of white it left behind. For the first time in a month, he forgot, for a moment, about his mother. Up there -- eighty-five miles high, ninety, ninety-five, the counter said -- everything on earth would be invisible. Mothers who disappeared, fathers who didn't love you, kids who mocked you -- everything would shrink to pinpoints and vanish. Up there: nothing but stars.</div>

At dinner, he said, "Gene is the youngest man ever to go into space, and they're going to do the longest spacewalk ever."

As the first transmission from the astronauts was patched through, Lydia heard only garbled, scratchy gibberish, as if the voices had been pressed through a grinder. Nath, however, had no trouble making out the words: Gene, breathless, whispering, "Boy, it sure is beautiful out here." NASA had no television feed of the men in orbit, so the station aired a simulation: an actor on wires, a prop set on a soundstage in Missouri. But when the space-suited figure lumbered out of the capsule and floated gracefully, effortlessly upward -- feet to the sky, tethered by nothing -- Nath forgot it wasn't real. He forgot everything. He forgot to breathe.</div>

<div class="line_en">James, who should have loved astronauts -- what were they but modern cowboys, after all, venturing into the newest frontier? -- did not know any of these things. Tangled in his thoughts, Marilyn's torn-up note pressed to his heart, he saw his son's new obsession through the other end of the telescope. The astronauts, far off in the sky, were mere specks. Two little men in a sardine can, tinkering with nuts and bolts, while here on earth people were disappearing, even dying, and others were struggling just to stay alive one more day. So frivolous, so ridiculous: actors playing dress-up, strung on wires, pretending to be brave. Dancing with their feet above their heads.

Nath, clutching his cheek, darted out of the room, as did Lydia, and James, left alone in the living room with the image of his son's shocked, reddening eyes, kicked the television to the floor in a burst of glass and sparks.

Tented by his blanket, he pulled a flashlight from under his pillow and reread the articles in order, memorizing every detail. He learned the name of each launch: Freedom. Aurora. Sigma.

<div class="line_en">Lydia had nothing to keep her mind off the mother-shaped hole in her world, and with Nath distracted by docking adaptors and splashdowns and apogees, she noticed something: the house smelled different without her mother in it. Once she noticed this, she could not stop noticing. At night she dreamed terrible things: she was crawling with spiders, she was tied up with snakes, she was drowning in a teacup. Sometimes, when she woke in the dark, she could hear the creak of the sofa springs downstairs as their father turned over, then turned again. Those nights, she never fell back asleep again, and the days grew sticky and thick, like syrup.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only one thing in the house still reminded Lydia of her mother: the big red cookbook. While her father locked himself in his office and Nath bent his head over the encyclopedia, she would go into the kitchen and take it down from the counter. At five, she could already read some -- though not nearly as well as Nath -- and she sounded out the recipes: Chocolate Joy Cake. Olive Loaf. Onion Slim-Dip. Each time she opened the cookbook, the woman on the front looked a little more like her mother -- the smile, the folded-back collar, the way she looked not right at you but over your shoulder, just past you. After her mother had come back from Virginia, she had read this book every day: in the afternoon, when Lydia came home from school; in the evening, before Lydia went to bed. In the mornings, sometimes, it was still on the table, as if her mother had been reading it all night.

That morning, when she and Nath had asked their father about hot dogs and sparklers and s'mores, he had said only, "We'll see," and they all knew this meant no. Without their mother, there would be no barbeques, no lemonade, no walking down to the lake to watch the fireworks. There would be nothing but peanut butter and jelly and the house with the curtains pulled shut. She flipped the pages, looking at the photos of cream pies and cookie houses and standing rib roasts.

<div class="line_en">Far off in Toledo, Marilyn did not hear the silent promise her young daughter was making. On the third of July, while Lydia huddled beneath the dining table, Marilyn bent over a new book: Advanced Organic Chemistry. Her midterm was in two days, and she had been studying all morning. With her notebook in hand, Marilyn felt like an undergraduate again; even her signature had gone soft and round, like it had been before she married, before her handwriting stiffened and tightened. All the other students in her course were college kids, some diligently trying to get ahead, some reluctantly trying to catch up from failed classes and bad semesters. To her surprise, they treated her no differently than they treated each other: quiet, polite, focused. In the cool lecture hall, they all sketched molecules, labeling them ethyl, methyl, propyl, butyl; at the end of the class, they compared notes and hers were exactly the same: beautiful little hieroglyphs of hexagons and lines. Proof, she told herself, that I'm just as smart as the others. That I belong.</div>

Other days, the messages were more subtle: a typo in the textbook --"the common acids, egg. nitric, acetic…"-- left her in tears, thinking of hard-boiled, sunny-side up, scrambled.

It was six forty-one in the morning, but it took only two rings. "Hello?" James had said. A long pause. "Hello?" She said nothing, not daring to speak, just letting that voice soak into her heart. He had sounded hoarse -- just static, she told herself, though she did not truly believe this.

Another time, when she called in the middle of the morning, James, exhausted, had fallen asleep at his desk, and Nath had picked up instead. "Lee residence," he had answered dutifully, just as she'd trained him, and Marilyn wanted to say, Are you all right? Are you being good? but found her throat swollen shut with longing. Nath, to her surprise, didn't hang up at the silence. He had knelt on the kitchen chair, which he'd climbed to reach the phone, listening. After a moment, Lydia had tiptoed in from the doorway and crouched beside him, the handset sandwiched between their ears, for two minutes, three minutes, four, as if they could hear everything their mother was feeling and wishing in the gentle hiss on the line. They had been the ones to hang up first, and after the click, Marilyn had cradled the phone for a long time, hands trembling.</div>

<div class="line_en">She told herself that everything was possible now, in this new life. She subsisted on cereal and sandwiches and spaghetti from the pizza joint down the street; she had not known it was possible to live without owning a single pot. Eight more credits, she calculated, and she would finish her degree. She tried to forget everything else. She rolled Nath's marble between her fingers as she wrote away for medical school brochures. She snapped the clip of Lydia's barrette -- one-two, one-two -- as she penned tiny notes in the margins of her textbook. She concentrated so hard that her head ached.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nath and Lydia never mentioned this to their father, and James never reported the calls to the police. He had already begun to suspect that they were not much interested in helping him, and deep inside, where his old fears lay coiled, he thought he understood their reasoning: it had only been a matter of time before a wife like Marilyn left a husband like him. Officer Fiske continued to be very kind, but James resented this even more; the politeness made it even harder to bear. For her part, Marilyn told herself each time she put down the receiver that it was the last time, that she would not call again, that this was proof her family was fine, that she had begun a new life. She told herself this so firmly that she believed it completely, until the next time she found herself dialing their number.</div>

<div class="line_en">That third day of July, Marilyn flipped a page in her textbook and black cotton clouded her view. Her head went heavy as a melon, pulling her off balance, buckling her knees, dragging her toward the floor. In a moment, her vision cleared, then her mind. She discovered a spilled glass of water trickling off the tabletop, her notes scattered across the tiles, her blouse clammy and damp. Only when her own handwriting came back into focus did she stand again.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had never fainted before, never even come close, even during the hottest days of summer. Now she was tired, almost too tired to stand up. Easing herself onto the sofa cushions, Marilyn thought, Maybe I'm sick, maybe I caught a bug from someone. Then another thought arrived and her whole body went cold. It was the third; she was sure of this; she had been counting down the days to this exam. That meant she was nearly -- she counted on her fingers, alert now, as if she'd been doused with icy water -- three weeks late. No. She thought back. Since before she left home almost nine weeks ago. She hadn't realized it had been so long.</div>

<div class="line_en">She wiped her hands on her jeans and tried to stay calm. After all, she had been late before. When she'd been stressed, or sick, as if her body hadn't enough attention to keep everything running, as if something had to be put on hold. Working as hard as she was, perhaps her body could not keep up. You're just hungry, Marilyn told herself. She hadn't eaten all day and it was nearly two o'clock. There was nothing in the cupboard, but she would go to the store. She would get food and eat it and then she would feel much better. Then she would get back to studying.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end, Marilyn would never take that exam. At the store, she put cheese and bologna and mustard and soda into her cart. She lifted a loaf of bread from the shelf.

With the grocery sack under her arm and the six-pack of bottles in her hand, she headed to her car, and without warning the parking lot spiraled around her. Knees, then elbows, slammed into asphalt. The paper sack tumbled to the ground. Soda bottles shattered on the pavement, exploding in a spray of fizz and glass.</div>

<div class="line_en">She dug in her purse for a handkerchief and touched its corner to her palm and suddenly the cut was drained dry, the handkerchief blotched scarlet. The beauty of her hand amazed her: the pureness of the colors, the clarity of the white flecks and the thin lines on the muscle. She wanted to touch it, to lick it. To taste herself. Then the cut began to sting, and blood began to pool in her cupped palm, and she realized she would have to go to the hospital.</div>

<div class="line_en">The emergency room was almost empty. The next day it would be full of Fourth of July accidents: food poisoning from bad egg salad, burned hands from grill fires, singed eyebrows from rogue fireworks. That afternoon, though, Marilyn walked up to the front desk and held out her hand, and in a few minutes she found herself on a cot, a petite young blonde in white taking her pulse and examining her palm. And when the young blonde said, "Let's get you stitched up," and took a bottle of anesthetic from a cupboard, Marilyn blurted out, "Shouldn't the doctor do that?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Marilyn sat up slowly. Her groceries lay scattered around her, the loaf of bread in a puddle, the jar of mustard slowly rolling away toward a green VW van. Cola dripped down her shins. She had cut herself on the glass: a deep gash right across the center of her palm, straight as a ruler's edge. It did not hurt at all. She turned her hand from side to side, letting the light play on the layers of skin like sandstone strata: clearish pink, like watermelon, with flecks of snowy white. At the bottom, a river of rich red welled up.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that everything happened very fast. There were tests to be run, vials of blood to be drawn. Marilyn didn't remember exactly how it worked but knew it involved rabbits. "Oh, we don't use rabbits anymore," the pretty young doctor laughed, slipping the needle into the soft crook of Marilyn's arm. "We use frogs now. Much faster and easier. Isn't modern science wonderful?" Someone got Marilyn a cushioned chair and a blanket to drape over her shoulders; someone asked for her husband's phone number, which Marilyn, in a daze, recited. Someone brought her a glass of water. The cut on her hand was closed and mute now, black sutures binding the raw flesh shut. Hours passed, but it seemed only a few minutes before James was there, radiant with amazement, holding her good hand while the young doctor said, "We'll call you with the results on Tuesday, Mr. and Mrs. Lee, but it looks like you'll be due in January." Then, before Marilyn could speak, she stepped into the long white hallway and disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来，就是她身不由己的开端。先是一系列的检查和抽血化验，玛丽琳不太确定这些检查化验的原理，但她记得，这样的检查需要在兔子身上做实验。但年轻美丽的女医生笑了，她把针头推进玛丽琳柔软的肘窝：“我们现在用青蛙，比兔子更快，更简单。现代科学是多么的奇妙呀。”有人给玛丽琳拿来一只靠垫和一张毛毯，让她披在身上；有人询问她丈夫的电话号码，玛丽琳茫然地背了出来；有人给她端来一杯水。她手上的伤口已经没了感觉，黑色的缝线合拢了外翻的皮肉。几个小时过去了，等詹姆斯赶来，却像是只过了几分钟。他惊愕地握着玛丽琳的另一只手。年轻的医生说：“我们星期二会打电话告知你们检查结果，李先生和李太太，不过，我想你的预产期应该在一月份。”然后，没等玛丽琳开口，她就步入长长的白色走廊，消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the young woman closed the gash with neat black stitches, Marilyn's hands began to ache. She clenched her teeth, but the ache spread into her wrists, up to her shoulders, down her spine. It wasn't the surgery. It was disappointment: that like everyone else, she heard doctor and still thought -- would forever think -- man. The rims of her eyes started to burn, and when Dr. Greene tied off the last stitch and smiled and said, "How are you feeling?" Marilyn blurted out, "I think I'm pregnant," and burst into tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻女人用黑线整齐地缝合了伤口。玛丽琳的手疼了起来，她咬紧牙关，但是疼痛蔓延到手腕，一直上升到肩膀，又沿着脊柱下降。疼痛并非手术引起，而是因为失望，跟其他人一样，当她听到“医生”这个称呼，仍然会想到——永远会想到——男人。她的眼眶开始发热。缝完最后一针，格林医生打了个结，微笑道：“你感觉怎么样？”玛丽琳再次脱口而出：“我觉得我怀孕了。”然后就哭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

The next day, he would take a taxi from Middlewood back to Toledo and make the hour-long drive again in Marilyn's car, warm and aglow at knowing his wife would be there when he got home. For now, though, he drove carefully, scrupulously obeying the speed limit, reaching over every few miles to pat Marilyn's knee, as if reassuring himself that she was still there. "Are you too cold? Are you too warm? Are you thirsty?" he asked again and again. I'm not an invalid, Marilyn wanted to say, but her mind and tongue seemed to move in slow motion: they were already home, he had already gone to get her a cold drink and a pillow for the small of her back. He was so happy, she thought; look at that little bounce at the end of each step, look at how he tucked the blanket so carefully around her feet. When he came back, she said only, "Where are the children?" and James said he had left them across the street with Vivian Allen, not to worry, he would take care of everything.</div>

Lydia and Nath stared at her warily across the table, as if she might suddenly do something unexpected, like scream, or explode. Nath's mouth puckered, as if he were sucking something sour, and Marilyn wanted to stroke his hair and tell him that she hadn't planned any of this, hadn't meant for this to happen.

She would spend the rest of her years guiding Lydia, sheltering her, the way you tended a prize rose: helping it grow, propping it with stakes, arching each stem toward perfection. In Marilyn's belly, Hannah began to fidget and kick, but her mother could not yet feel it. She buried her nose in Lydia's hair and made silent promises.

<div class="line_en">James was already taking plates from the cupboard, distributing napkins, lifting the lid of the top box in a whiff of meat-scented steam. Marilyn put a slice of pepperoni pizza on each of their plates, and Nath, with a deep, contented sigh, began to eat. His mother was home, and tomorrow there would be hard-boiled eggs for breakfast, hamburgers and hot dogs for supper, strawberry shortcake for dessert. Across the table, Lydia stared down at her portion in silence, at the red circles dotting the surface, at the long thin threads of cheese tying it back to the box.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nath was only half-right: the next day there were hot dogs and hamburgers, but no eggs, no shortcake. James grilled the meat himself, charring it slightly, but the family, determined to celebrate, ate it anyway. In fact, Marilyn would refuse to cook at all after her return, each morning popping frozen waffles into the toaster, each evening heating a frozen potpie or opening a can of SpaghettiOs. She had other things on her mind. Math, she thought that Fourth of July; she will need math, this daughter of mine. "How many buns inside the bag?" she asked, and Lydia tapped each with her finger, counting up. "How many hot dogs are on the grill? How many won't have buns?" At each right answer, her mother smoothed her hair and cuddled her against her thigh.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of just one book, Marilyn bought a stack: The Science of Air. Why There Is Weather. Fun with Chemistry. At night, after she tucked Nath in, she perched on the edge of Lydia's bed and lifted one from the top. Lydia huddled against her, listening to the deep, underground drum of her mother's heartbeat. When her mother breathed in, she breathed in. When her mother breathed out, she breathed out. Her mother's voice seemed to come from within her own head. "Air is everywhere," her mother read. "Air hovers all around you. Though you can't see it, it is still there. Everywhere you go, air is there." Lydia snuggled deeper into her mother's arms, and by the time they reached the last page, she was almost asleep.

<div class="line_en">And in return, Lydia kept her own promise: she did everything her mother asked. She learned to write the plus sign, like a little stunted t. She counted on her fingers every morning, adding up over the cereal bowl. Four plus two. Three plus three. Seven plus ten. Whenever her mother stopped, she asked for more, which made her mother glow, as if Lydia had flicked on a light. She stood on the step stool over the sink, aproned from neck to ankle, and pinched baking soda into a jar of vinegar. "That's a chemical reaction," her mother said, and Lydia nodded as the foam gurgled down the drain. She played store with her mother, making change with pennies and nickels: two cents for a hug, four cents for a kiss.

<div class="line_en">Inside Lydia could feel it: everything that was to come. One day the books would have no pictures. The problems would grow longer and harder. There would be fractions, decimals, exponents. The games would get trickier. Over meat loaf her mother would say, "Lydia, I'm thinking of a number. If you multiply by two and add one, you get seven." She would count her way back until she got the right answer, and her mother would smile and bring in the dessert. One day her mother would give her a real stethoscope. She would undo the top two buttons of her blouse and press the chestpiece to her skin and Lydia would hear her mother's heart directly. "Doctors use these," her mother would say. It was far away then, tiny in the distance, but Lydia already knew it would happen. The knowledge hovered all around her, clinging to her, every day getting thicker. Everywhere she went, it was there. But every time her mother asked, she said yes, yes, yes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two weeks later, Marilyn and James drove to Toledo to retrieve her clothes and books. "I can go alone," Marilyn insisted. By then the marble and the barrette and the button nestled quietly, forgotten, in the pocket of her dress in the closet. Already the dress was growing tight and soon Marilyn would give it away to Goodwill, with her tiny, forgotten talismans still tucked inside. Still, her eyes stung at the thought of emptying that apartment, sealing her books back into cartons, tossing her half-filled notebooks into the rubbish. She wanted privacy for this little funeral. "Really," she said. "You don't have to come." James, however, insisted. "I don't want you lifting anything heavy in your condition," he said. "I'll ask Vivian Allen to stop by and watch the kids for the afternoon."</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as James and Marilyn had gone, Mrs. Allen turned the TV to a soap opera and sat down on the couch. Lydia hugged her knees under the dining table, cookbookless; Nath picked lint from the carpet and glowered. His mother woke him up and tucked him in, but Lydia filled up all the spaces in between. He knew the answer to every question their mother asked, but whenever he tried to jump in, she shushed him while Lydia counted on her fingers. At the museum, he wanted to watch the star show in the planetarium, but they spent the whole day looking at the skeletons, the model of the digestive system, whatever Lydia wanted. That very morning, he had come down to the kitchen early, clutching his folder of news clippings, and his mother, still in her bathrobe, gave him a sleepy smile over the rim of her teacup. It was the first time she had really looked at him since she came home, and something fluttered in his throat like a little bird. "Can I have a hard-boiled egg?" he asked, and, like a miracle, she said, "All right." For a moment he forgave her everything. He decided he would show her the pictures of the astronauts he'd been collecting, his lists of launches, everything. She would understand them. She would be impressed.</div>

Nath pouted in the corner, flicking the edges of his folder, but no one paid any attention to him until his father came into the kitchen. "Still mooning over those astronauts?" he said, plucking an apple from the fruit bowl on the counter. He laughed at his own joke and bit into the apple, and even across the kitchen Nath had heard the hard crunch of teeth piercing skin. His mother, listening to Lydia recount last night's dream, had not. She had forgotten all about his egg. The little bird in his throat had died and swelled so that he could hardly breathe.</div>

Inside, mothers were boiling eggs or baking cakes or making pot roasts, or maybe fathers were poking the coals in the barbecue, turning the hot dogs with a fork so that the grill made perfect black lines all over.

Quietly they tiptoed upstairs and hid their wet clothes in the hamper and put on dry, and when their parents returned with suitcases and boxes of books, they said nothing. When their mother complained about the water spots on the floor, Nath said he had spilled a drink. At bedtime, Nath and Lydia brushed their teeth sociably at the sink, taking turns to spit, saying goodnight as if it were any other night. It was too big to talk about, what had happened. It was like a landscape they could not see all at once; it was like the sky at night, which turned and turned so they couldn't find its edges. It would always feel too big. He pushed her in.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们踉跄着朝家里走去，一言不发，在人行道上留下潮湿的脚印。除了艾伦夫人的鼾声，房间里只有水从他们的衣服落到地毯上的声音。他们只离开了二十分钟，但感觉好像过去了好几个世纪。他们蹑手蹑脚地上了楼，把湿衣服藏进洗衣篮，换上干衣服，他们的父母拖着手提箱和装书的纸盒返回之后，他们什么都没说。母亲抱怨地板上的水渍时，内斯说，是他打翻了饮料。上床睡觉之前，内斯和莉迪亚一起在水池边刷牙，彬彬有礼地轮流漱口，像平时一样互道晚安。这件事太严重，不能说出来，好比某处他们无法一眼看清的风景，好比夜晚的天空，漫无边际，总是让人觉得太大。他把她推下去，然后又把她拉上来。在莉迪亚的一生中，她将会记住一件事。在内斯的一生中，他也会记住另一件事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's okay," James said, and for a moment Nath felt better. Then his father added, "Now, if they had a contest for reading all day --" All month he had been saying things like this: things that sounded like jokes but weren't. Every time, as he heard his own voice, James bit the tip of his tongue, too late. He did not understand why he said these things to Nath, for that would have meant understanding something far more painful: that Nath reminded him more and more of himself, of everything he wanted to forget from his own boyhood. He knew only that it was becoming a reflex, one that left him smarting and ashamed, and he glanced away. Nath looked down at his broken egg, yolk trickling between blades of grass, whites seeping into the soil. Lydia gave him a small smile, and he ground the shell into the dirt with his sneaker. When his father turned his back, Nath spat into the lawn at his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系。”詹姆斯说。听到这话，内斯感觉好了一点，但是，他的父亲又补充道：“要是他们比赛读一整天书……”一个月来，他总是重复类似的话，听着像开玩笑，其实却不是。每当发觉自己脱口而出的时候，詹姆斯都会下意识地咬住舌尖，但是已经太迟了。他不理解为什么他会对内斯说这些话，这样只会揭示更多的痛苦事实：内斯越来越让他想起自己，想起他试图忘记的童年往事。他知道儿子成了他当年的缩影，让他感到难过和羞愧，想到这里，他的目光飘到了一边。内斯看着地上摔碎的鸡蛋，蛋黄在草叶上流淌，蛋清渗进土壤，莉迪亚对他微微笑了一下，他用穿着帆布鞋的脚把蛋壳碾碎。詹姆斯转过身去，内斯朝着他脚边啐了一口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Middlewood Elementary held its annual welcome-back picnic on the last weekend in August. Their mother pressed one hand to her belly, where Hannah grew heavier every day; their father carried Lydia on his shoulders as they walked across the parking lot. After lunch, there were contests: who could hit a Wiffle ball the farthest, who could toss the most beanbags into a coffee can, who could guess the number of jelly beans in the one-gallon Mason jar. Nath and James entered the father-son egg race, each balancing a raw egg in a teaspoon like an offering. They made it almost all the way to the finish line before Nath tripped and dropped his. Miles Fuller and his father crossed the line first and Mrs. Hugard, the principal, gave them the blue ribbon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每年暑假结束，重新开学的时候，米德伍德小学都会举行欢迎野餐会。玛丽琳手按着肚子，汉娜一天比一天重了；他们的父亲用肩膀扛着莉迪亚，穿过停车场。午饭后还有几个比赛，看谁扔空心威浮球扔得最远，谁能把最多的沙袋投进咖啡罐，谁能猜出一加仑玻璃瓶里的糖豆数量。内斯和詹姆斯参加了“父子鸡蛋赛跑”——每人头顶一个生鸡蛋向前跑，鸡蛋装在茶匙里，像上菜一样。他们一路领先，然而在快冲线时，内斯绊了一下，鸡蛋掉了。迈尔斯·富勒和他父亲得了第一名，校长哈格德夫人颁发给他们蓝绶带。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then came the three-legged race. A teacher looped a handkerchief around Lydia's and Nath's ankles and they hobbled to the starting line, where other children were tethered to their parents, or to siblings, or to each other. They had hardly begun to run when Lydia caught the edge of Nath's shoe under her own and stumbled. Nath threw an arm wide for balance and wobbled. He tried to match Lydia's stride, but when Lydia swung her leg forward, Nath pulled back. The handkerchief around their ankles was tied so tight their feet throbbed. It didn't loosen, yoking them together like mismatched cattle, and it didn't come undone, even when they jerked in opposite directions and tumbled face-forward onto the soft, damp grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来是“三条腿赛跑”。一位老师用一条手绢把莉迪亚和内斯的脚踝绑在一起，他们蹒跚着来到起跑线上。那些参加比赛的孩子和他们的父母、兄弟姐妹相互绑在一起。还没开始跑，莉迪亚就被内斯的鞋帮绊了一下，身体摇晃起来，内斯伸出一只胳膊保持平衡。他想跟上莉迪亚的步伐，但莉迪亚朝前迈腿的时候，内斯无意中向后一拉。手绢捆得很紧，把两人的脚踝勒得难受，像一条套住了两头并不匹配的牲口的轭，连他们各自朝着相反方向仰面朝天地摔倒在柔软湿滑的草地上时，都没有松开。">查看中文翻译</div>
