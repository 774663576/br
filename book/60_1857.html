<div class="line_en">I have been thinking about Tomas for many years. But only in the light of these reflections did I see him clearly. I saw him standing at the window of his flat and looking across the courtyard at the opposite walls, not knowing what to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年来，我一直想着托马斯。但只是在这些思想的启发下，我才第一次真正看清他。我看见他，站在公寓的一扇窗户前，目光越过庭院，盯着对面房子的墙，他不知道他该做什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had come to feel an inexplicable love for this all but complete stranger; she seemed a child to him, a child someone had put in a bulrush basket daubed with pitch and sent down-stream for Tomas to fetch at the riverbank of his bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对这个几乎不相识的姑娘，他感到了一种无法解释的爱。对他而言，她就像是个被人放在涂了树脂的篮子里的孩子，顺着河水漂来，好让他在床榻之岸收留她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stayed with him a week, until she was well again, then went back to her town, some hundred and twenty-five miles from Prague. And then came the time I have just spoken of and see as the key to his life: Standing by the window, he looked out over the courtyard at the walls opposite him and deliberated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在他家待了一个星期，流感一好，便回到她居住的城镇，那儿离布拉格两百公里。正是在这个时候出现了我方才提及的那个片刻，即我看到了托马斯生活关键的那个时刻：他站在窗前，目光越过庭院，盯着对面房子的墙，在思忖：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He kept recalling her lying on his bed; she reminded him of no one in his former life. She was neither mistress nor wife. She was a child whom he had taken from a bulrush basket that had been daubed with pitch and sent to the riverbank of his bed. She fell asleep. He knelt down next to her. Her feverous breath quickened and she gave out a weak moan. He pressed his face to hers and whispered calming words into her sleep. After a while he felt her breath return to normal and her face rise unconsciously to meet his. He smelled the delicate aroma of her fever and breathed it in, as if trying to glut himself with the intimacy of her body. And all at once he fancied she had been with him for many years and was dying. He had a sudden clear feeling that he would not survive her death. He would lie down beside her and want to die with her. He pressed his face into the pillow beside her head and kept it there for a long time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一次又一次，总是想起那个躺在他长沙发上的女人的模样；她和他过去生活中的任何女人都不一样。既不是情人，也不是妻子。她只是个他从涂了树脂的篮子里抱出来，安放在自己的床榻之岸的孩子。她睡着了。他跪在她的身边。她烧得直喘气，越喘越急促，他听到了她微微的呻吟。他把脸贴在她的脸上，在她睡梦中轻声安慰她。过了一会儿，他感觉她的呼吸平静了一些，她的脸不由自主地往他的脸上凑。他感到她的双唇有一股微微有点呛人的高烧的热气味。他吸着这股气息，仿佛想啜饮她身体的隐秘。于是他想象她已经在他家住了许多许多年，此刻正在死去。突然，他清楚地意识到她要是死了，他也活不下去。他要躺在她身边，和她一起死。受了这一幻象的鼓动，他挨着她的脸，把头埋在枕头里，许久。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Looking out over the courtyard at the dirty walls, he realized he had no idea whether it was hysteria or love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他望着院子脏乎乎的墙，明白自己不知道这到底是出于疯狂，还是爱情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But was it love? The feeling of wanting to die beside her was clearly exaggerated: he had seen her only once before in his life! Was it simply the hysteria of a man who, aware deep down of his inaptitude for love, felt the self-deluding need to simulate it? His unconscious was so cowardly that the best partner it could choose for its little comedy was this miserable provincial waitress with practically no chance at all to enter his life!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可这是爱吗？他确信那一刻他想死在她的身边，这种情感明显是太过分了：他不过是生平第二次见她而已！或许这更是一个男人疯狂的反应，他自己的心底明白不能去爱，于是跟自己玩起了一场爱情戏？与此同时，他在潜意识里是如此懦弱，竟为自己的这场戏选了这个原本无缘走进他生活的可怜的乡间女招待！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he was distressed that in a situation where a real man would instantly have known how to act, he was vacillating and therefore depriving the most beautiful moments he had ever experienced (kneeling at her bed and thinking he would not survive her death) of their meaning.</div>

<div class="line_en">Einmal ist keinmal, says Tomas to himself. What happens but once, says the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯自言自语：einmal ist keinmal，这是一个德国谚语，是说一次不算数，一次就是从来没有。只能活一次，就和根本没有活过一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Was it better to be with Tereza or to remain alone?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和特蕾莎在一起好呢，还是一个人好呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, sketch is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the ground-work for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有任何方法可以检验哪种抉择是好的，因为不存在任何比较。一切都是马上经历，仅此一次，不能准备。好像一个演员没有排练就上了舞台。如果生命的初次排练就已经是生命本身，那么生命到底会有什么价值？正因为这样，生命才总是像一张草图。但“草图”这个词还不确切，因为一张草图是某件事物的雏形，比如一幅画的草稿，而我们生命的草图却不是任何东西的草稿，它是一张成不了画的草图。">查看中文翻译</div>
