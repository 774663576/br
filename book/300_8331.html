<div class="line_en">FROM this intense consciousness of being the object of severe and universal observation, the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length relieved, by discerning, on the outskirts of the crowd, a figure which irresistibly took possession of her thoughts. An Indian, in his native garb, was standing there; but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the English settlements, that one of them would have attracted any notice from Hester Prynne, at such a time; much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind. By the Indian's side, and evidently sustaining a companionship with him, stood a white man, clad in a strange disarray of civilised and savage costume.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was small in stature, with a furrowed visage, which, as yet, could hardly be termed aged. There was a remarkable intelligence in his features, as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself, and become manifest by unmistakable tokens. Although, by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb, he had endeavoured to conceal or abate the peculiarity, it was sufficiently evident to Hester Prynne, that one of this man's shoulders rose higher than the other. Again, at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage, and the slight deformity of the figure, she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain. But the mother did not seem to hear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他身材矮小，满脆皱纹，不过还很难说年事已高。他一望可知是个智慧出众的人，似乎智力上的高度发展不可能不引起形体上的变化，从而在外表上具备了显著的特征。尽管他似乎是漫不经心地随便穿了件土人的衣服，其实是要遮掩或减少身体的怪异之处，但海丝特·白兰仍一眼便看出那个人的两肩并不一般高。她一看到了那人瘦削、多皱的面孔和稍稍变形的躯体，便不由自主地再一次把婴儿紧楼在胸前，直弄得那可怜的孩子义疼得哭出了声。但作母亲的好象对此听而不闻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At his arrival in the market-place, and some time before she saw him, the stranger had bent his eyes on Hester Prynne. It was carelessly, at first, like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward, and to whom external matters are of little value and import, unless they bear relation to something within his mind. Very soon, however, his look became keen and penetrative. A writhing horror twisted itself across his features, like a snake gliding swiftly over them, and making one little pause, with all its wreathed intervolutions, in open sight. His face darkened with some powerful emotion, which, nevertheless, he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will, that, save at a single moment, its expression might have passed for calmness. After a brief space, the convulsion grew almost imperceptible, and finally subsided into the depths of his nature. When he found the eyes of Hester Prynne fastened on his own, and saw that she appeared to recognise him, he slowly and calmly raised his finger, made a gesture with it in the air, and laid it on his lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那个不速之客来到市场，海丝特·白兰还没看到他之前，他的目光早已直勾勾地盯上了她。起初，他的目光只是随随便便的，象是一个习惯于洞察他人内心的人，除非外表上的什么东西与内心有关，否则外观便既无价值又不重要。然而，他的目光很快就变得犀利而明察秋毫了。他的面孔上掠过一阵痛苦的恐怖，象是一条蛇在上面迅速蜿蜒，因稍停片刻，而使那盘踞的形体清晰可见。他的脸色由于某种强有力的内心冲动而变得阴暗，不过他人刻用一种意志力控制住，使这种脸色稍纵即逝，换上了一副可以说是平静的表情。仅仅过了瞬间，那种痉挛就几乎消逝得无影无踪，终于沉积在他天性的深渊。当他发现海丝特·白兰的目光与他的目光相遇，并且看来已经认出了他时，他便缓慢而乎落地举起一个手指，在空中做了一个姿势，然后把手指放在自己的嘴唇上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Truly, friend; and methinks it must gladden your heart, after your troubles and sojourn in the wilderness," said the townsman, "to find yourself, at length, in a land where iniquity is searched out, and punished in the sight of rulers and people; as here in our godly New England. Yonder woman, sir, you must know, was the wife of a certain learned man, English by birth, but who had long dwelt in Amsterdam, whence, some good time agone, he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of the Massachusetts. To this purpose, he sent his wife before him, remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs. Marry, good sir, in some two years, or less, that the woman has been a dweller here in Boston, no tidings have come of this learned gentleman, Master Prynne; and his young wife, look you, being left to her own misguidance --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah! -- aha! -- I conceive you," said the stranger, with a bitter smile. "So learned a man as you speak of should have learned this, too, in his books.

<div class="line_en">"It behooves him well, if he be still in life," responded the townsman. "Now, good sir, our Massachusetts magistracy, bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair, and doubtless was strongly tempted to her fall -- and that, moreover, as is most likely, her husband may be at the bottom of the sea -- they have not been bold to put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her. The penalty thereof is death. But in their great mercy and tenderness of heart, they have doomed Mistress Prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the pillory, and then and thereafter, for the remainder of her natural life, to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是他还活着，是该由他来办的，”那镇上人附和着说。“唉，好心的先生，我们马萨诸塞的当局认为，这个女人年轻漂亮，准是受了极大的诱惑才堕落的——何况，很可能，她的丈夫已经葬身海底——那些当官的不敢大胆地用我们正义的法律强制判她极刑。论罪，她是该处死的。但是，由于他们心肠软，大慈大悲，只判了白兰太太在刑台上站三个小时，以后，在她的有生之年，胸前要永远佩戴一个耻辱的标记。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While this passed, Hester Prynne had been standing on her pedestal, still with a fixed gaze towards the stranger; so fixed a gaze that, at moments of intense absorption, all other objects in the visible world seemed to vanish, leaving only him and her. Such an interview, perhaps, would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did, with the hot, mid-day sun burning down upon her face, and lighting up its shame; with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast; with the sin-born infant in her arms; with a whole people, drawn forth as to a festival, staring at the features that should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the fireside, in the happy shadow of a home, or beneath a matronly veil, at church. Dreadful as it was, she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses. It was better to stand thus, with so many betwixt him and her, than to greet him, face to face, they two alone. She fled for refuge, as it were, to the public exposure, and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawn from her. Involved in these thoughts, she scarcely heard a voice behind her, until it had repeated her name more than once, in a loud and solemn tone, audible to the whole multitude.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这段时间里，海丝特·白兰一直站在高台上，牢牢盯视着那陌生人；她的注意力完全集中到他身上，那一阵子，她的视界内的一切目标全都从她眼前消失了，只剩下了他和她两个人。或许，在另外一种场合同他邂逅要益发可怕。如今呢，她那本来只该在壁炉旁恬静的柔光中，在家中幸福的暗处或在教堂的庄严气氛笼罩下才能看到的姿容，却在聚拢来的全镇人面前，被大家象看热闹似的死盯着：炎炎的午日烧灼着她的面孔，照亮了脸上的耻辱，她胸前佩着丑陋的鲜红标记，怀中抱着因罪孽而生下的婴儿。此情此景虽然可怕，但她却感到这数以千计的旁观者的存在倒是一种庇护。她这样站着，在她和他之间隔着这么多入，总比只有他们俩面面相溯要好受一些。她确实向这种示众场面寻求着避难之所，唯恐这项保护伞会从她身边撤掉。她的脑际充满了这种种念头，对于她身后传来的话语竟然充耳不闻一直到后来那严肃的话音越来越高地一再重复她的名字，使得在场的所有的人都听得一清二楚了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It has already been noticed, that directly over the platform on which Hester Prynne stood was a kind of balcony, or open gallery, appended to the meeting-house. It was the place whence proclamations were wont to be made, amidst an assemblage of the magistracy, with all the ceremonial that attended such public observances in those days. Here, to witness the scene which we are describing, sat Governor Bellingham himself, with four sergeants about his chair, bearing halberds, as a guard of honour. He wore a dark feather in his hat, a border of embroidery on his cloak, and a black velvet tunic beneath; a gentleman advanced in years, with a hard experience written in his wrinkles. He was not ill fitted to be the head and representative of a community, which owed its origin and progress, and its present state of development, not to the impulses of youth, but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood, and the sombre sagacity of age; accomplishing so much, precisely because it imagined and hoped so little. The other eminent characters, by whom the chief ruler was surrounded, were distinguished by a dignity of mien, belonging to a period when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness of Divine institutions. They were, doubtless, good men, just, and sage. But, out of the whole human family, it would not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons, who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring woman's heart, and disentangling its mesh of good and evil, than the sages of rigid aspect towards whom Hester Prynne now turned her face. She seemed conscious, indeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect, lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude; for, as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony, the unhappy woman grew pale and trembled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前面已经提及，就在海丝特·白兰站立的高台的正上方．有一处阳台，或者说是露天走廊，是从议事厅延伸出来的。当年，在地方陡官开会中间如果要发布什么公告，需要镇民都来出席聆听时，就在这里举行种种仪式。今天，为了目睹我们上面所描写的场面，贝灵汉总督亲自坐阵，椅子后面站着四个持朝的警卫充当仪仗。他帽子上插着一支黑羽毛，大氅上绣着花边，里面衬着的是黑丝绒紧身衣；他是一位中长的绅士，皱纹中印下了他的艰苦的经历。他出任这一地区的首脑和代表很适当，因为这一殖民地的起源和发展及其现状，并非取决于青春的冲动，而有赖于成年的严厉和老练，以及老中的权谋和手腕；他们所以能成就颇多，恰恰因为他们的幻想和希望有限。环绕着这位总督的其他显要，一个个都威风凛凛，因为他们所属的时代，官方机构被公认为具有神权制度的仲圣性。不消说，他们都是为人圣洁、主持正义的好人。然而，要从整个人类大家庭中遴选出同等数量的英明贤德之士绝非易举，假如让这种人坐下来审判一个犯了罪的女人的心灵，并分清善与恶的交错盘结，比起海丝特·白兰此时转过身来面对着的这伙表情倡滞的圣人们，不一定高明多少。确实，她似乎深知这一点，不管她期待着什么样的同情，只能到人群中的博大及温暖曲胸怀中去寻求，因此，当她始眼朝阳台上望去时，这个不幸的女人立时面色苍白，周身战栗了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hester Prynne," said the clergyman, "I have striven with my young brother here, under whose preaching of the Word you have been privileged to sit" -- here Mr. Wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a pale young man beside him -- "I have sought, I say, to persuade this godly youth, that he should deal with you, here in the face of Heaven, and before these wise and upright rulers, and in hearing of all the people, as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin. Knowing your natural temper better than I, he could the better judge what arguments to use, whether of tenderness or terror, such as might prevail over your hardness and obstinacy; insomuch that you should no longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall. But he opposes to me (with a young man's over-softness, albeit wise beyond his years) that it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to lay open her heart's secrets in such broad daylight, and in presence of so great a multitude. Truly, as I sought to convince him, the shame lay in the commission of the sin, and not in the showing of it forth. What say you to it, once again, brother Dimmesdale! Must it be thou, or I, that shall deal with this poor sinner's soul?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and famous John Wilson, the eldest clergyman of Boston, a great scholar, like most of his contemporaries in the profession, and withal a man of kind and genial spirit. This last attribute, however, had been less carefully developed than his intellectual gifts, and was, in truth, rather a matter of shame than self-congratulation with him. There he stood, with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skull-cap; while his grey eyes, accustomed to the shaded light of his study, were winking, like those of Hester's infant, in the unadulterated sunshine. He looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes of sermons; and had no more right than one of those portraits would have, to step forth, as he now did, and meddle with a question of human guilt, passion, and anguish.</div>

Be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him; for believe me, Hester, though he were to step down from a high place, and stand there beside thee, on thy pedestal of shame, yet better were it so, than to hide a guilty heart through life. What can thy silence do for him, except it tempt him -- yea, compel him, as it were -- to add hypocrisy to sin? Heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy, that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee, and the sorrow without.

<div class="line_en">"Woman, transgress not beyond the limits of Heaven's mercy!" cried the Reverend Mr. Wilson, more harshly than before. "That little babe hath been gifted with a voice, to second and confirm the counsel which thou hast heard. Speak out the name! That, and thy repentance, may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy breast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“女人，你违背上天的仁慈，可不要超过限度！”威尔逊牧师先生更加严厉地嚷道。“你那小小的婴儿都用她那天赐的声音，来附和并肯定你所听到的规劝了。把那人的姓名说出来吧！那样，再加上你的悔改，将有助于从你胸前取下那红字。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never!" replied Hester Prynne, looking, not at Mr. Wilson, but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman. "It is too deeply branded. Ye cannot take it off. And would that I might endure his agony, as well as mine!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我永远不会说的！”海丝特·白兰回答说，她的眼睛没有去看威尔逊先生，而是凝视着那年轻牧师的深沉而忧郁的眼睛。“这红字烙得太深了。你是取不下来的。但愿我能在忍受我的痛苦的同时，也忍受住他的痛苦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will not speak!" answered Hester, turning pale as death, but responding to this voice, which she too surely recognized. "And my child must seek a heavenly Father; she shall never know an earthly one!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不说！”海丝特回答着，她的脸色虽然变得象死人一样惨白，但还是对那个她确认无疑的声音作出了答复。“我的孩子应该寻求一个上天的父亲！她将永远不会知道有一个世俗的父亲的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She will not speak!" murmured Mr. Dimmesdale, who, leaning over the balcony, with his hand upon his heart, had awaited the result of his appeal. He now drew back, with a long respiration. "Wondrous strength and generosity of a woman's heart! She will not speak!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她不肯说！”丁梅斯代尔先生嗫嘘着。他一直俯身探出阳台，一只手捂住心口，特候着听他呼吁的结果，这时他长长吐了一口气，缩回了身体。“一个女人的心胸是多么坚强和宽阔啊！她不肯说！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Speak, woman!" said another voice, coldly and sternly, proceeding from the crowd about the scaffold. "Speak; and give your child a father!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说吧，女人！”从刑台附近的人群中发出的另一个冷酪的声音说。“说出来吧：让你的孩子有一个父亲！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Discerning the impractible state of the poor culprit's mind, the elder clergyman, who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion, addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin, in all its branches, but with continual reference to the ignominious letter. So forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol, for the hour or more during which his periods were rolling over the people's heads, that it assumed new terrors in their imagination, and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames of the infernal pit. Hester Prynne, meanwhile, kept her place upon the pedestal of shame, with glazed eyes, and an air of weary indifference. She had borne, that morning, all that nature could endure; and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon, her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility, while the faculties of animal life remained entire. In this state, the voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly, but unavailingly, upon her ears. The infant, during the latter portion of her ordeal, pierced the air with its wailings and screams; she strove to hush it, mechanically, but seemed scarcely to sympathise with its trouble. With the same hard demeanour, she was led back to prison, and vanished from the public gaze within its iron-clamped portal. It was whispered, by those who peered after her, that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-way of the interior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年长的牧师看出来这可怜的罪人一意孤行，他对此早已成竹在胸，便对人群发表了一通论述罪恶的演讲，他列举了形形色色的罪过，并且时时涉及那不光彩的字母。他在长达一个多小时的演讲中，详尽地叙述着这个标记，他那强有力的言辞在人们的耳际反复轰鸣，在他们的心头引起了新的恐惧，似乎把这个标记用炼狱之火染得通红。与此同时，海丝特·白兰始终带着一种疲惫的淡然神情，在她的耻辱台上凝眸端立。那天早晨，她忍受了人性所能承担的一切；由于她的气质决定了她不会以昏厥来逃避过于强烈的苦难，她的精神只能躲藏在麻木的石质硬壳下，而令动物生命助机能依然无损。因此，那位布道者的声音虽在她耳畔残酷无情地响如雷鸣，但却无济于事。在她备受折磨的这后一段时间，那婴儿的尖声哭号直贯云霄；她虽下意识地想哄着孩子安静下来，但似乎对婴儿的不安无动于衷。她就这样木雕泥塑般地又给带回监狱，从众人眼前捎失在钉满铁钉的牢门后面。那些目光随着她身影窥视的人耳语着说，她胸前的红字在中内黑漆漆的通路上投下了一道血红的闪光。">查看中文翻译</div>
