<div class="line_en">Eugene was not quite sixteen years old when he was sent away to the university. He was, at the time, over six feet and three inches tall, and weighed perhaps 130 pounds. He had been sick very little in his life, but his rapid growth had eaten sharply at his strength: he was full of a wild energy of mind and body that devoured him and left him exhausted. He tired very quickly.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a child when he went away: he was a child who had looked much on pain and evil, and remained a fantasist of the Ideal. Walled up in his great city of visions, his tongue had learned to mock, his lip to sneer, but the harsh rasp of the world had worn no grooving in the secret life. Again and again he had been bogged in the gray slough of factuality. His cruel eyes had missed the meaning of no gesture, his packed and bitter heart had sweltered in him like a hot ingot, but all his hard wisdom melted at the glow of his imagination. He was not a child when he reflected, but when he dreamt, he was; and it was the child and dreamer that governed his belief. He belonged, perhaps, to an older and simpler race of men: he belonged with the Mythmakers. For him, the sun was a lordly lamp to light him on his grand adventuring. He believed in brave heroic lives. He believed in the fine flowers of tenderness and gentleness he had little known. He believed in beauty and in order, and that he would wreak out their mighty forms upon the distressful chaos of his life. He believed in love, and in the goodness and glory of women. He believed in valiance, and he hoped that, like Socrates, he would do nothing mean or common in the hour of danger. He exulted in his youth, and he believed that he could never die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他离开家的时候，还只是个孩子。他小小年纪就已经饱尝了人生的痛苦和罪恶，但是他始终充满了幻想。由于封闭在伟大的远景中，他逐渐学会了冷嘲热讽，讥笑别人，但是人生的挫折并没有在他个人的生活里留下创痕。他一次次深深地陷在现实的灰色泥沼里。他冷酷、无情的双眼看穿了别人的一举一动。他沉重、痛苦的心在体内酷热难耐，就像铁锭一样。但是他辛苦获得的智慧全部融解在想象的光辉里。他思考问题的时候，显得很老成，不像是个孩子，可是一旦做起梦来，就跟孩子一样；正是孩子和梦想家的角色才支配着他的基本信念。他也许属于远古淳朴的人类物种，属于“神话制造者”。在他眼里，太阳就是上天赐予的一盏灯，照耀着他伟大的探险旅程。他由衷地相信英雄们的英勇事迹。他相信美人如花似玉的温柔。虽然他自己很少体验过。他相信一切美好、有序的事物，立志有朝一日要从自己的生活中把杂乱无序驱逐出去。他相信爱情，相信所有的女性都是善良而光荣的。他相信勇敢，希望自己能像苏格拉底那样，在危急困难的时候不做低劣、卑俗的事情。他为自己的青春而欢欣喜悦，他相信自己会永生不死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The quiet one was more quiet and morose than he had ever been before: he stalked through the house scowling ferociously. All his conversation with Eliza was short and bitterly scornful; with Gant he spoke hardly at all. They had never talked together. Their eyes never met -- a great shame, the shame of father and son, that mystery that goes down beyond motherhood, beyond life, that mysterious shame that seals the lips of all men, and lives in their hearts, had silenced them.</div>

As they sat upon their beds at night, reading and smoking before they slept, all of the pain and bitterness of Benjamin Gant's life burst out in violent denunciation.

The rest of us never had anything, but I want to see you get all that's coming to you. My God!" he cried furiously. "Their money's doing no one any good rotting in the damned bank, is it? No, 'Gene, get all you can. When you get down there, if you find you need more to hold your own with the other boys, make the old man give it to you.

<div class="line_en">And these buffooneries -- a little cruel, but only with the cruelty of vacant laughter, and a part of the schedule of rough humor in an American college -- salty, extravagant, and national -- opened deep wounds in him, which his companions hardly suspected. He was conspicuous at once not only because of his blunders, but also because of his young wild child's face, and his great raw length of body, with the bounding scissor legs. The undergraduates passed him in grinning clusters: he saluted them obediently, but with a sick heart. And the smug smiling faces of his own classmen, the wiser Freshmen, complacently guiltless of his own mistakes, touched him at moments with insane fury.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene's first year at the university was filled for him with loneliness, pain, and failure. Within three weeks of his matriculation, he had been made the dupe of a half-dozen classic jokes, his ignorance of all campus tradition had been exploited, his gullibility was a byword. He was the greenest of all green Freshmen, past and present: he had listened attentively to a sermon in chapel by a sophomore with false whiskers; he had prepared studiously for an examination on the contents of the college catalogue; and he had been guilty of the inexcusable blunder of making a speech of acceptance on his election, with fifty others, to the literary society.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he walked across the campus, he heard his name called mockingly from a dozen of the impartial windows, he heard the hidden laughter, and he ground his teeth. And at night, he stiffened with shame in his dark bed, ripping the sheet between his fingers as, with the unbalanced vision, the swollen egotism of the introvert, the picture of a crowded student-room, filled with the grinning historians of his exploits, burned in his brain. He strangled his fierce cry with a taloned hand. He wanted to blot out the shameful moment, unweave the loom. It seemed to him that his ruin was final, that he had stamped the beginning of his university life with folly that would never be forgotten, and that the best he could do would be to seek out obscurity for the next four years. He saw himself in his clown's trappings and thought of his former vision of success and honor with a lacerating self-contempt.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Smile and smile and s-mile -- damn you!" he cursed through his grating teeth. For the first time in his life he began to dislike whatever fits too snugly in a measure. He began to dislike and envy the inconspicuous mould of general nature -- the multitudinous arms, legs, hands, feet, and figures that are comfortably shaped for ready-made garments. And the prettily regular, wherever he found it, he hated -- the vacantly handsome young men, with shining hair, evenly parted in the middle, with sure strong middling limbs meant to go gracefully on dancefloors. He longed to see them commit some awkward blunder -- to trip and sprawl, to be flatulent, to lose a strategic button in mixed company, to be unconscious of a hanging shirt-tail while with a pretty girl. But they made no mistakes.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no one to whom he could turn: he had no friends. His conception of university life was a romantic blur, evoked from his reading and tempered with memories of Stover at Yale, Young Fred Fearnot, and jolly youths with affectionate linked arms, bawling out a cheer-song. No one had given him even the rudimentary data of the somewhat rudimentary life of an American university. He had not been warned of the general taboos. Thus, he had come greenly on his new life, unprepared, as he came ever thereafter on all new life, save for his opium visions of himself a stranger in Arcadias.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在学校里他没有可以依赖的人，也没有朋友。他对大学生活的概念只是一种浪漫的模糊印象，他读过的书给了他一些启发，但是脑子里总幻想耶鲁的史陀佛、年轻无畏的弗雷德，以及一些年轻、快乐、热情的同伴们手拉手，齐声欢歌的景象。从来没有人给他讲述过美国大学生活的基本状况，也没有人告诫过他大学的各种禁忌。所以，他在一种完全陌生、毫无准备的状态下开始了自己全新的生活，就跟他今后所有的新生活一样，而他梦里陌生的世外桃源却与此大相径庭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the university was a charming, an unforgettable place. It was situated in the little village of Pulpit Hill, in the central midland of the big State. Students came and departed by motor from the dreary tobacco town of Exeter, twelve miles away: the countryside was raw, powerful and ugly, a rolling land of field, wood, and hollow; but the university itself was buried in a pastoral wilderness, on a long tabling butte, which rose steeply above the country. One burst suddenly, at the hill-top, on the end of the straggling village street, flanked by faculty houses, and winding a mile in to the town centre and the university. The central campus sloped back and up over a broad area of rich turf, groved with magnificent ancient trees. A quadrangle of post-Revolutionary buildings of weathered brick bounded the upper end: other newer buildings, in the modern bad manner (the Pedagogic Neo-Greeky), were scattered around beyond the central design: beyond, there was a thickly forested wilderness. There was still a good flavor of the wilderness about the place -- one felt its remoteness, its isolated charm. It seemed to Eugene like a provincial outpost of great Rome: the wilderness crept up to it like a beast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，大学是一个迷人、令人难忘的地方。它坐落在这个大州的中部地带，在一个名叫讲坛山的小镇上。学生们乘坐汽车进出都会经过12英里外一个沉闷的、名叫埃克西特的烟草镇。乡村表现出一种原始的力量和粗犷。大片的田地、树林和坑坑洼洼的山谷起伏不平。但是大学却屹立在村庄的孤山之上，掩隐在这质朴的荒野里。走上山顶，你会突然发现一条小街，街道两侧都是教职工的住宅，沿着街道弯弯曲曲行走一英里就到了小镇的中心和大学。大学的主校区位于一大块绿茵茵的草坪斜坡上，这里古树参天，郁郁葱葱，非常壮观。在斜坡上有一个大革命后期建造的红砖庭院，而其他新造的建筑物都具有现代气息，样子非常难看（效仿新希腊式的风格）。这些建筑物分布在中心庭院的四周，远处便是林木茂盛的郊野。整个地方具有粗犷的迷人气氛——人们能感觉到它的孤高之美。在尤金眼里，这里就像古罗马帝国的一个边远村落，荒野就像巨兽从四面八方包围过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Its great poverty, its century-long struggle in the forest, had given the university a sweetness and a beauty it was later to forfeit.

<div class="line_en">In this pastoral setting a young man was enabled to loaf comfortably and delightfully through four luxurious and indolent years. There was, God knows, seclusion enough for monastic scholarship, but the rare romantic quality of the atmosphere, the prodigal opulence of Springtime, thick with flowers and drenched in a fragrant warmth of green shimmering light, quenched pretty thoroughly any incipient rash of bookishness. Instead, they loafed and invited their souls or, with great energy and enthusiasm, promoted the affairs of glee-clubs, athletic teams, class politics, fraternities, debating societies, and dramatic clubs. And they talked -- always they talked, under the trees, against the ivied walls, assembled in their rooms, they talked -- in limp sprawls -- incessant, charming, empty Southern talk; they talked with a large easy fluency about God, the Devil, and philosophy, the girls, politics, athletics, fraternities and the girls -- My God! how they talked!</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他是一位虔诚的古希腊迷——一位文雅却懒散的学者。在他的指导下，尤金开始阅读《荷马》了。他几乎不懂什么语法，虽然从伦纳德那儿学过一些，但是他糟糕的启蒙教育并没有教给他多少东西。所以在巴克·班森眼里，他的语法知识比他实际掌握的更少。尤金拼命刻苦学习，但是这位文雅之士严厉、阴郁的目光往往令他心慌意乱、支支吾吾、颤颤巍巍、举止笨拙。就在尤金心儿扑通扑通直跳、声音颤抖地慢慢朗读时，巴克·班森的表情越来越厌烦，最后干脆丢下课本，拖着长音说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But that which remained most vividly, later, in the drowning years which cover away so much of beauty, was the vast sea-surge of Homer which beat in his brain, his blood, his pulses, as did the sea-sound in Gant's parlor shells, when first he heard it to the slowly pacing feet and the hexametrical drawl of Buck Benson, the lost last weary son of Hellas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是在他日后无数美好的记忆里，最鲜活生动的还是荷马海涛澎湃、翻卷腾跃的诗句，它们不停地撞击着他的大脑、血液、脉搏，就像海浪响彻在尤金的躯体里。当他第一次听到这种声音时，发现它正好与巴克·班森——这位希腊文化最后一位迷失的诗人舒缓的脚步声和朗读六音部诗行的拖长音调相得益彰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, on the examination, he gave an excellent performance, and translated from sight beautifully. He was saved. Buck Benson commended his paper publicly with lazy astonishment, and gave him a fair grade. Thereafter, they slipped quickly into an easier relation: by Spring, he was reading Euripides with some confidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然如此，但到了考试的时候，尤金却表现得特别优秀，并且翻译得很棒。他终于得救了。巴克·班森用惊讶且懒散的声音当众夸奖了他，并且给了他高分。从那以后，他们的关系很快就变得融洽起来，到了春天，尤金已经满怀信心地开始阅读欧里庇得斯的悲剧了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dwaney de clangay genett, argereoyo beeoyo -- above the whistle's shriek, the harsh scream of the wheel, the riveter's tattoo, the vast long music endures, and ever shall. What dissonance can quench it? What jangling violence can disturb or conquer it -- entombed in our flesh when we were young, remembered like "the apple tree, the singing, and the gold"?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Dwaney de clangay genett，argereoyo beeoyo——在口哨的尖厉嘶鸣声、汽车刺耳的尖叫声、铆钉工人的敲打声以外，这首嘹亮、悠扬的乐声一直回荡在耳边，永远不会消逝。尘世上有什么不和谐的音符能将它淹没？什么噪声、喧闹能打断或者干扰它？当我们年轻的时候，它已经根植在我们的血肉中，就像“苹果树、歌声和黄金”那样被我们时时想起。">查看中文翻译</div>
