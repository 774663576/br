<div class="line_en">Hallorann didn't know about anyone else on 196, but he personally was almost scared enough to shit peachpits. Outside the window there was nothing to be seen but a buffeting curtain of white. The plane rocked sickeningly from side to side with gusts that seemed to come from everywhere. The engines were cranked up to provide partial compensation and as a result the floor was vibrating under their feet. There were several people moaning in Tourist behind them, one stew had gone back with a handful of fresh airsick bags, and a man three rows in front of Hallorann had whoopsed into his National Observer and had grinned apologetically at the stewardess who came to help him clean up. "That's all right," she comforted him, "that's how I feel about the Reader's Digest." Hallorann had flown enough to be able to surmise what had happened. They had been flying against bad headwinds most of the way, the weather over Denver had worsened suddenly and unexpectedly, and now it was just a little late to divert for someplace where the weather was better. Feets don't fail me now.</div>

<div class="line_en">At 8:31 A. M., MST, a woman on TWA's Flight 196 burst into tears and began to bugle her own opinion, which was perhaps not unshared among some of the other passengers (or even the crew, for that matter), that the plane was going to crash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山区标准时间上午8点31分，环球航空公司196次航班上有位女乘客突然哭了起来，并开始鼓吹她的观点：飞机将会坠毁。其他一些乘客（甚至包括机组人员）也许并非没有同感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's going to crash!" the woman was crying out shrilly. "Oh, I just know it is!" A stewardess hurried to her seat and squatted beside her. Hallorann thought to himself that only stewardesses and very young housewives seemed able to squat with any degree of grace; it was a rare and wonderful talent. He thought about this while the stewardess talked softly and soothingly to the woman, quieting her bit by bit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“飞机会坠毁！”那女人尖声叫道。“噢，我就知道会的。”一位空中小姐急忙走过来蹲在她座位边。哈洛伦暗想：蹲得还算雅观，看来只有空中小姐和非常年轻的家庭主妇才做得到；这是一种稀有、奇妙的本领。他这样想着的时候，空中小姐轻言细语地安慰着那个女人——她慢慢平静下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sharp-faced woman next to Hallorann looked up from her book and offered a brief character analysis: "Ninny," and went back to her book. She had downed two screwdrivers during the flight, but they seemed not to have thawed her at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">The stewardess seemed to have succeeded in curbing the worst of the woman's hysterics. She was snuffling and honking into a lace handkerchief, but had ceased broadcasting her opinions about the flight's possible conclusion to the cabin at large. The stew gave her a final pat on the shoulder and stood up just as the 747 gave its worst lurch yet. The stewardess stumbled backward and landed in the lap of the man who had whoopsed into his paper, exposing a lovely length of nyloned thigh. The man blinked and then patted her kindly on the shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位空中小姐似乎成功地止住了那个女人的歇斯底里。那女人还在抽鼻子，蒙着网织手帕呜呜哭着，但已经中止了就本次航班可能的结局向整个机舱广播她的观点。空中小姐最后拍了拍她的肩膀，刚站起来，波音747就发生了到此为止最剧烈的震颤。空中小姐身子一歪，向后倒进了刚才吐脏了报纸的那个男人的怀里，暴露出一段穿着尼龙长袜的秀腿。男人眨眨眼，然后友善地拍了拍她的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they descended through the impenetrable clouds of snow, Hallorann thought of a crash that had occurred at Boston's Logan Airport a few years ago. The conditions had been similar, only fog instead of snow had reduced visibility to zero. The plane had caught its undercarriage on a retaining wall near the end of the landing strip. What had been left of the eighty-nine people aboard hadn't looked much different from a Hamburger Helper casserole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们穿过密密层层的雪团时，哈洛伦想起了几年前发生在波士顿洛根机场的一次空难。当时的情况与眼前的架式很相似，只不过当时是大雾而不是雪把能见度降到了零。飞机起落架挂在了离降落跑道末端不远的挡土墙上，机上89人剩下的东西看起来跟汉堡包配料焙盘差不多。">查看中文翻译</div>

He kept thinking of the way those hedge animals had seemed to move…</div>

<div class="line_en">Because he had only the flight bag he'd carried for luggage, Hallorann beat the crowd to the Hertz desk on the lower level. Outside the smoked glass windows he could see the snow still falling steadily. The gusting wind drove white clouds of it back and forth, and the people walking across to the parking area were struggling against it. One man lost his hat and Hallorann could commiserate with him as it whirled high, wide, and handsome. The man stared after it and Hallorann thought: (Aw, just forget it, man. That homburg ain't comin down until it gets to Arizona.) On the heels of that thought: (If it's this bad in Denver, what's it going to be like west of Boulder?) Best not to think about that, maybe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦的行李只有那只飞行包，因此他很快便穿过人群来到了楼下的赫兹出租车柜台。他可以看到，凝着雾汽的玻璃窗外，雪还在不住地飘落，一阵阵狂风卷着团团雪花在飞舞，人们顶着风穿越停车区，有个人的帽子被风刮走了，它打着旋儿飞得又高又远，煞是好看，那个人在后面瞪着它。哈洛伦很为他惋惜，心想：（喂，忘掉它，伙计。不飞到亚利桑拿它是不会掉下来的。）接着又想：（丹佛的天气都这样糟，不知道博尔德以西的地方会是个什么样子？）也许，最好别想它。">查看中文翻译</div>
