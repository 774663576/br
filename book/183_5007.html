<div class="line_en">At that very moment the others were washing hands and faces in the river and generally getting ready for dinner and a rest. The three best archers had gone up into the hills north of the bay and returned laden with a pair of wild goats which were now roasting over a fire. Caspian had ordered a cask of wine ashore, strong wine of Archenland which had to be mixed with water before you drank it, so there would be plenty for all. The work had gone well so far and it was a merry meal. Only after the second helping of goat did Edmund say, "Where's that blighter Eustace?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Eustace stared round the unknown valley. It was so narrow and deep, and the precipices which surrounded it so sheer, that it was like a huge pit or trench. The floor was grassy though strewn with rocks, and here and there Eustace saw black burnt patches like those you see on the sides of a railway embankment in a dry summer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，尤斯塔斯瞪着眼睛朝这陌生的山谷四下张望。山谷又狭又深，周围的悬崖十分陡峭，谷里就像个大坑或壕沟。底部虽然遍地岩石却长满了草，尤斯塔斯看见到处有烧焦的黑斑瘾，像干旱的夏天铁路路堤两边所见的焦痕一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About fifteen yards away from him was a pool of clear, smooth water. There was, at first, nothing else at all in the valley; not an animal, not a bird, not an insect. The sun beat down and grim peaks and horns of mountains peered over the valley's edge.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eustace realized of course that in the fog he had come down the wrong side of the ridge, so he turned at once to see about getting back. But as soon as he had looked he shuddered. Apparently he had by amazing luck found the only possible way down -- a long green spit of land, horribly steep and narrow, with precipices on either side. There was no other possible way of getting back. But could he do it, now that he saw what it was really like? His head swam at the very thought of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤斯塔斯当然明白自己原来是在雾中爬到山脊另一边去了。所以他马上回头看看回去的路。可是他一看便不禁浑身发抖。明摆着他是万分侥幸才摸到这惟一一条下来的路的——长长一条绿色的暗道，陡峭狭窄，两岸悬崖耸峙。没有别的路好回去了。他既然看到了实际情况，还能不能上去呢？他一想到这念头，头也晕了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned round again, thinking that at any rate he'd better have a good drink from the pool first. But as soon as he had turned and before he had taken a step forward into the valley he heard a noise behind him. It was only a small noise but it sounded loud in that immense silence. It froze him dead-still where he stood for a second. Then he slewed round his neck and looked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再掉过头去，心想无论如何最好还是先在水塘里喝个痛快。谁知他刚掉过头，还没向山谷里迈前一步，就听见背后有声音。声音虽小，但是在那无比寂静中听上去也够响的。他吓得在原地僵立了一会儿，才回过头去看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the bottom of the cliff a little on his left hand was a low, dark hole -- the entrance to a cave perhaps. And out of this two thin wisps of smoke were coming. And the loose stones just beneath the dark hollow were moving (that was the noise he had heard) just as if something were crawling in the dark behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在崖底，他左手不远的地方有个低矮的黑洞——也许是一个山洞的入口。洞口冒出两缕细烟。就在黑洞下面那堆松散的石块在动（他听见的就是这声音），恰如有什么东西在后面暗处爬着。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Something was crawling. Worse still, something was coming out. Edmund or Lucy or you would have recognized it at once, but Eustace had read none of the right books. The thing that came out of the cave was something he had never even imagined -- along lead-coloured snout, dull red eyes, no feathers or fur, a long lithe body that trailed on the ground, legs whose elbows went up higher than its back like a spider's cruel claws, bat's wings that made a rasping noise on the stones, yards of tail. And the lines of smoke were coming from its two nostrils. He never said the word Dragon to himself. Nor would it have made things any better if he had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然有什么东西在爬。更糟糕的是，竟然爬出来了。要是爱德蒙和露茜，一看准认得出，你也认得出，可是尤斯塔斯没看过一本对路的书。爬出来那东西他连想象都没想象到过——铅灰色的长鼻子，暗红色的眼睛，身上没羽毛，也没皮毛，长长一条柔软的身子，在地面上爬行，腿弯部分抬起来比背部还要高，像蜘蛛腿，凶残的爪子，蝙蝠翼在石头上发出刺耳的嘎嘎声，尾巴老长老长。那两道烟是从它两个鼻孔里冒出来的。他心里从来没想到龙这个词儿，就是想到了，事情也好不了多少。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But perhaps if he had known something about dragons he would have been a little surprised at this dragon's behaviour. It did not sit up and clap its wings, nor did it shoot out a stream of flame from its mouth. The smoke from its nostrils was like the smoke of a fire that will not last much longer. Nor did it seem to have noticed Eustace. It moved very slowly towards the pool -- slowly and with many pauses. Even in his fear Eustace felt that it was an old, sad creature. He wondered if he dared make a dash for the ascent. But it might look round if he made any noise. It might come more to life. Perhaps it was only shamming. Anyway, what was the use of trying to escape by climbing from a creature that could fly?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他要是知道一些龙的知识，也许他对这条龙的举动就不会那么吃惊了。这条龙没有坐起来拍拍翅膀，也没从嘴里喷出一道火焰。它鼻孔里冒出来的烟就像火烟，没多久就消失了。它似乎没注意到尤斯塔斯，只顾很慢很慢地向水塘爬去，爬爬还歇了好多回。尤斯塔斯尽管心里害怕，也觉得这是个衰老凄惨的怪物。他不知自己是不是敢冲过去爬上坡。不过如果他弄出声音来，它就可能回过头来，也可能会苏醒过来。也许它只不过装装样子，不管怎样，想爬上去，从会飞的怪物身边逃走有什么用呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The relief was so great that Eustace almost laughed out loud. He began to feel as if he had fought and killed the dragon instead of merely seeing it die. He stepped over it and went to the pool for his drink, for the heat was getting unbearable. He was not surprised when he heard a peal of thunder. Almost immediately afterwards the sun disappeared and before he had finished his drink big drops of rain were falling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这下可大大放心了，尤斯塔斯差点大声笑出来。他不由开始感到自己不是眼看这条龙死去，而是打了一仗，亲手把它杀死似的。他跨过龙身，走到水塘边喝水，因为这里热得受不了。他听到隆隆一阵雷声，倒也并不吃惊。雷声响过，顿时就不见太阳，他还没喝完，大滴大滴的雨点就下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It reached the pool and slid its horrible scaly chin down over the gravel to drink: but before it had drunk there came from it a great croaking or clanging cry and after a few twitches and convulsions it rolled round on its side and lay perfectly still with one claw in the air. A little dark blood gushed from its wide-opened mouth. The smoke from its nostrils turned black for a moment and then floated away. No more came. this was the brute's trick, the way it lured travellers to their doom. But one couldn't wait for ever. He took a step nearer, then two steps, and halted again. The dragon remained motionless; he noticed too that the red fire had gone out of its eyes. At last he came up to it. He was quite sure now that it was dead. With a shudder he touched it; nothing happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它爬到水塘，把长满可怕鳞甲的下巴滑到砂砾层上，但它还没喝上水，就发出嘎嘎一大声，像是飞鹤的尖戾，扭曲挣扎了几下后，它就翻了个身，侧身躺着，一动不动，一只爪子还翘在半空。张大的嘴里涌出一点乌黑的血。鼻孔里的烟一时也变黑了，接着又飘走了。就此再也没动静了。尤斯塔斯好长时间不敢动弹。也许这是那怪物的诡计，诱骗外来人送死的花招。可是你也不能老等下去。他走近一步，再走两步又停下。那条龙还是一动也不动。他还注意到它眼睛里的红火也消失了。他终于走到它跟前。这回他绝对肯定它死了。他打了个寒噤，摸了它一下；什么事也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">这岛上的天气真是非常讨厌.转眼工夫尤斯塔斯就浑身湿透,眼睛也看不清,这么大的雨在欧洲可从没见过.只要这场大雨不停,想爬出山谷也没用.他冲进惟一看得见的龙洞去避雨.接着他就地躺下,拚命缓过气来.</div>

<div class="line_en">The climate of this island was a very unpleasant one. In less than a minute Eustace was wet to the skin and half blinded with such rain as one never sees in Europe. There was no use trying to climb out of the valley as long as this lasted. He bolted for the only shelter in sight -- the dragon's cave. There he lay down and tried to get his breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of us know what we should expect to find in a dragon's lair, but, as I said before, Eustace had read only the wrong books. They had a lot to say about exports and imports and governments and drains, but they were weak on dragons. That is why he was so puzzled at the surface on which he was lying. Parts of it were too prickly to be stones and too hard to be thorns, and there seemed to be a great many round, flat things, and it all clinked when he moved. There was light enough at the cave's mouth to examine it by. And of course Eustace found it to be what any of us could have told him in advance -- treasure. There were crowns (those were the prickly things), coins, rings, bracelets, ingots, cups, plates and gems.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们多半人都知道在龙洞里会看到什么，可是我上文已经说过，尤斯塔斯只看过些不相干的书，书上尽说些进口啊、出口啊、政府啊、耗费啊这一类词儿，就缺谈龙这方面的事。所以他对身子躺着的地面感到这么莫名其妙。有的地面太刺人但不像石头，而且太硬也不像荆棘，看来似乎有一大堆又圆又扁的东西，他一动这些东西就丁当响。洞口光线正好可以让他看个仔细。不消说，尤斯塔斯看到的正是我们任何人事先都可以告诉他的——财宝。有好些王冠（就是那刺人的东西），钱币、戒指、手镯、金锭、酒杯、餐盘和珍宝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time he was sound asleep and snoring the others had finished dinner and became seriously alarmed about him. They shouted, "Eustace! Eustace! Coo-ee!" till they were hoarse and Caspian blew his horn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他进入梦乡，呼呼大睡的时候，其他人已经吃完饭，对他的下落当真着起急来。他们大声喊着，“尤斯塔斯！尤斯塔斯！喂，喂，喂！”喊得大家嗓子嘶哑，凯斯宾还吹起号角。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eustace (unlike most boys) had never thought much of treasure but he saw at once the use it would be in this new world which he had so foolishly stumbled into through the picture in Lucy's bedroom at home. "They don't have any tax here," he said, "And you don't have to give treasure to the government. With some of this stuff I could have quite a decent time here -- perhaps in Calormen. It sounds the least phoney of these countries. I wonder how much I can carry? That bracelet now -- those things in it are probably diamonds -- I'll slip that on my own wrist. Too big, but not if I push it right up here above my elbow. Then fill my pockets with diamonds -- that's easier than gold. I wonder when this infernal rain's going to let up?" He got into a less uncomfortable part of the pile, where it was mostly coins, and settled down to wait. But a bad fright, when once it is over, and especially a bad fright following a mountain walk, leaves you very tired. Eustace fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤斯塔斯不像多半孩子那样，他对财富从来没看重过，可是他一看就明白，在他糊里糊涂一头从家里露茜卧房那幅画上闯进去的新天地中，这笔财宝会派多大用处。“这里什么捐税都不收，”他说，“你用不着把财宝交给政府。有了这些财宝，我在这儿——也许在卡乐门吧——可以过得逍遥自在了。这国名听上去一点不像假的。不知我带得了多少呢？马上拿那手镯——上面镶嵌的那些东西大概是钻石——我要把手镯戴在自己手腕上。太大了，但我要是把这一直撞到肘拐儿上面就不嫌大了。然后再在口袋里装满钻石——那比装金子容易。就不知这场该死的雨几时才停？”他坐到这堆财宝上一个比较舒服的地方安心等候，那地方大都是些钱币。不过，受了一场大惊，特别是走了山路再受一场大惊，惊魂才定，人就感到很疲倦。尤斯塔斯竟睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Eustace slept and slept -- and slept. What woke him was a pain in his arm. The moon was shining in at the mouth of the cave, and the bed of treasures seemed to have grown much more comfortable: in fact he could hardly feel it at all. He was puzzled by the pain in his arm at first, but presently it occurred to him that the bracelet which he had shoved up above his elbow had become strangely tight. His arm must have swollen while he was asleep (it was his left arm).</div>

<div class="line_en">He moved his right arm in order to feel his left, but stopped before he had moved it an inch and bit his lip in terror. For just in front of him, and a little on his right, where the moonlight fell clear on the floor of the cave, he saw a hideous shape moving. He knew that shape: it was a dragon's claw. It had moved as he moved his hand and became still when he stopped moving his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他挪动右臂，想去摸摸左臂，可是他还没挪动一英寸就住手了，吓得直咬嘴唇。因为就在他前面不远，稍稍偏右一点的地方，月光照在洞里一清二楚，他看见一个可怕的形状在移动。他知道那形状：是龙爪。他挪动他的手，它也在动，他一住手，它也一动不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, what a fool I've been," thought Eustace. "Of course, the brute had a mate and it's lying beside me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊呀，我真是糊涂蛋，”尤斯塔斯心想，“那怪物当然有个伙伴，它就躺在我身边呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For several minutes he did not dare to move a muscle. He saw two thin columns of smoke going up before his eyes, black against the moonlight; just as there had been smoke coming from the other dragon's nose before it died. This was so alarming that he held his breath. The two columns of smoke vanished. When he could hold his breath no longer he let it out stealthily; instantly two jets of smoke appeared again. But even yet he had no idea of the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一时间他丝毫不敢动弹。他看见眼前冒起两缕细烟，衬着月光，烟是黑的；正如刚才那条龙临死前鼻子里喷出来的烟一样。这真令人惊慌，他不由屏住气。两缕烟就此消失了。他屏不住多久，一口气悄悄溜了出来；两道黑烟顿时又出现在眼前。不过事到如今，他还是不明真相。不久他决定小心翼翼地斜着身子摸到左边，想法偷偷溜出洞去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但是哭也没用。他必须想法从两条龙中间爬出去才行。他开始伸展右臂。他右边那条龙的前肢和爪子的动作也完全一模一样。于是他心想，试试左臂吧。那边那条龙的前肢的动作竟也一模一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one will blame Eustace if at this moment he shed tears. He was surprised at the size of his own tears as he saw them splashing on to the treasure in front of him. They also seemed strangely hot; steam went up from them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如这时有谁看见尤斯塔斯掉眼泪，决不会怪他。他看见自己的泪水竟在面前的财宝上溅了一大片，不由吃了一惊。这泪水似乎也烫得出奇；上面还直冒热气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was such a clatter and rasping, and clinking of gold, and grinding of stones, as he rushed out of the cave that he thought they were both following him.

<div class="line_en">But just as he reached the edge of the pool two things happened.

<div class="line_en">That explained everything. There had been no two dragons beside him in the cave. The claws to right and left had been his own right and left claw. The two columns of smoke had been coming from his own nostrils. As for the pain in his left arm (or what had been his left arm) he could now see what had happened by squinting with his left eye. The bracelet which had fitted very nicely on the upper arm of a boy was far too small for the thick, stumpy foreleg of a dragon. It had sunk deeply into his scaly flesh and there was a throbbing bulge on each side of it. He tore at the place with his dragon's teeth but could not get it off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一来什么都清楚了。原来洞里他身边没有两条龙。左右两只爪子原来是他自己左右两只手。两缕烟原来是他自己鼻孔里冒出来的。至于他左臂（或者说他过去的左臂）的疼痛，现在他眯着左眼也看得出是怎么回事了。原来正好戴在孩子上臂的手镯，勒在龙那条粗短的前肢上未免太小太小了。手镯深深嵌在有鳞片的肉里，勒得两边肉都鼓起来，卡卡直跳。他用龙牙去咬那地方，可咬不掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In spite of the pain, his first feeling was one of relief. There was nothing to be afraid of any more. He was a terror himself and nothing in the world but a knight (and not all of those) would dare to attack him. He could get even with Caspian and Edmund now But the moment he thought this he realized that he didn't want to. He wanted to be friends. He wanted to get back among humans and talk and laugh and share things. He realized that he was a monster cut off from the whole human race. An appalling loneliness came over him. He began to see that the others had not really been fiends at all. He began to wonder if he himself had been such a nice person as he had always supposed. He longed for their voices. He would have been grateful for a kind word even from Reepicheep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管还痛，他头一个感觉倒是放下心来，现在没有什么可害怕的了。如今他自己就是令人恐怖的怪物，天底下除了骑士以外（而且也不是所有的骑士都如此），什么都不敢攻击他。如今他甚至可以跟凯斯宾和爱德蒙算账了……可是他在想这件事的时候，心里倒明白自己并不想算账。他想要交朋友。他想要回到人类中间去，跟大家谈天说笑，分享一切。他明白自己成了同整个人类隔绝的怪物。一股可怕的孤独感涌上心头。他开始明白其他人根本不是什么恶魔。不由纳闷自己究竟是不是他一贯自以为的好人。他巴不得听到他们的声音。哪怕听到雷佩契普一句好话他都会感激不尽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last he decided he would try to find his way back to the shore. He realized now that Caspian would never have sailed away and left him. And he felt sure that somehow or other he would be able to make people understand who he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他决定要想方设法寻找回到海岸去的路。他现在才明白凯斯宾决不会把船开走，扔下他不管。他深信自己总有办法让人们明白他是什么人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he thought of this the poor dragon that had been Eustace lifted up its voice and wept. A powerful dragon crying its eyes out under the moon in a deserted valley is a sight and a sound hardly to be imagined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条前身是尤斯塔斯的可怜的龙，一想到这点竟放声痛哭了。一条强大的龙，竟在月下一个荒凉的山谷里哭得死去活来，这情景，这声音简直难以想象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he turned to climb out of the valley. He began the climb with a jump and as soon as he jumped he found that he was flying. He had quite forgotten about his wings and it was a great surprise to him -- the first pleasant surprise he had had for a long time. He rose high into the air and saw innumerable mountain-tops spread out beneath him in the moonlight. He could see the bay like a silver slab and the Dawn Treader lying at anchor and camp fires twinkling in the woods beside the beach. From a great height he launched himself down towards them in a single glide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他转身爬出山谷。他开始爬时身子一跳，谁知刚一跳就不觉飞起来了。他完全忘了自己的翅膀了，这对他是一大惊喜发现——他有好长时间没享受到惊喜了。他就此高飞上天，看见月光中身下铺展着无数山顶。他看得见像一块银板似的海湾，黎明踏浪者号停泊着，海滩边林子里篝火闪闪发光。他从高处一个滑翔，朝他们直冲下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took a long drink and then (I know this sounds shocking, but it isn't if you think it over) he ate nearly all the dead dragon. He was half-way through it before he realized what he was doing; for, you see, though his mind was the mind of Eustace, his tastes and his digestion were dragonish. And there is nothing a dragon likes so well as fresh dragon. That is why you so seldom find more than one dragon in the same county.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他痛痛快快喝了一通，然后把那条死龙几乎全吃下肚去。（我知道这听上去吓人，可是你仔细想想就不吓人了。）他吃了一半才明白自己在干什么；因为，不瞒你说，虽然他的头脑还是尤斯塔斯的头脑，可是他的口味和消化力却是龙的。而龙所喜欢的食物莫过于新鲜龙肉了。这就是你在同一地方难以找到第二条龙的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy was sleeping very soundly for she had sat up till the return of the search party in hope of good news about Eustace. It had been led by Caspian and had come back late and weary. Their news was disquieting. They had found no trace of Eustace but had seen a dead dragon in a valley. They tried to make the best of it and everyone assured everyone else that there were not likely to he more dragons about, and that one which was dead at about three o'clock that afternoon (which was when they had seen it) would hardly have been killing people a very few hours before.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We must all show great constancy," Caspian was saying. "A dragon has just flown over the tree-tops and lighted on the beach. Yes, I am afraid it is between us and the ship. And arrows are no use against dragons. And they're not at all afraid of fire."</div>

<div class="line_en">They got up, all with swords drawn, and formed themselves into a solid mass with Lucy in the middle and Reepicheep on her shoulder. It was nicer than the waiting about and everyone felt fonder of everyone else than at ordinary times. A moment later they were marching. It grew lighter as they came to the edge of the wood.
