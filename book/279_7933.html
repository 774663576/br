<div class="line_en">The two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the aroused watch–dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.</div>

By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:</div>

In time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是汤姆拿出一根针，去掉了线。两个孩子各自往大拇指上戳了一下，然后挤出两滴血来。接着他们又挤了数次，汤姆马上用小指蘸血写下了自己姓名的首字母。他又教哈克写好Ｈ和F，到此为止，宣誓结束。他们念着咒语，举行了干巴巴的埋葬仪式，靠墙将松木板埋了。他们认为连同埋葬的还有那锁住他们口舌的枷锁，因此钥匙也用不着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tiptoed out, through the broken weather–boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter was lying, and FACING Potter, with his nose pointing heavenward.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the gently–snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="分手的时候，他们还在想这个问题。等汤姆从窗户爬进卧室时，天已经快亮了。他轻手轻脚脱去衣服，睡下的时候，庆幸自己出去没被人发觉。但他却没发现轻轻打着呼声的希德没睡着，而且醒了已有一个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, but she ain't DEAD. And what's more, she's getting better, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这没错，可她毕竟还活着，并且正在康复呐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not been called-persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down–stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was up–hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆醒来后发现希德已穿戴完毕走了。天已大亮，寝室里又没有人，一看便知时候不早了。汤姆感到很吃惊——为什么今天没人叫他呢？要是往日的话，他们非盯着他起来不可。想到这，他觉得情况有点不妙。不到五分钟，他就穿好衣服到了楼下，感到浑身不对劲，懒洋洋的。全家人已吃完了早饭，但仍然坐在餐桌旁，没人怪他迟到，也没人瞅他。大家默不作声，显得十分严肃，这让他的心凉了半截。他坐下来，装着愉快的样子，可是谈何容易。大伙既不笑，也不吱声。于是他也只好一声不吭，心情沉重到了极点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid; and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go. His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他离去时很伤心，结果都想不起来要报复希德这件事，可是希德却多此一举：快速从后门溜掉了。汤姆满脸愁容，闷闷不乐地来到学校。他和乔·哈帕一起，因为头一天逃学的事情被鞭笞了一顿。在挨鞭笞时，他一副忧心仲仲的样子，根本不把鞭笞这类小事情放在眼里。之后，他走到位子上坐下来，两手托腮放在桌子上，一副痛苦的样子，目不转睛地盯着墙直发愣。他的肘部压在什么硬东西上，过了好一段时间，他才难过地慢慢移动了下肘部，叹息着拿起那样东西。东西包在纸里，他打开纸包，接着重重地长叹一声，原来纸包里包着他的那个铜把手！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早饭过后，汤姆被姨妈叫到一边，他面带喜色满以为希望就要实现：挨鞭笞。可是姨妈没有打他，而是站在他旁边痛哭起来。她边哭边责怪汤姆怎么能这样让她这把年纪的人伤心呢？然后她说了通气话，既然汤姆不再听她的，那就让他继续这样混下去，自暴自弃直至要了她这条老命为止。这一席话比一千下鞭打更管用，汤姆的心比肉体更加痛楚不安。他大哭起来，一边央求姨妈原谅他，一边一遍又一遍地保证悔过自新。这样姨妈最后饶了他，可他觉得她并没有完全饶恕他，因此心中还是半信半疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
