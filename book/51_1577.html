<div class="line_en">For a moment, the cameras hold on Peeta's downcast eyes as what he says sinks in. Then I can see my face, mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest, magnified on every screen as I realize, Me! He means me! I press my lips together and stare at the floor, hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside of me.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the anthem, the tributes file back into the Training Center lobby and onto the elevators. I make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta. The crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones, so we have only each other for company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to deposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only just stepped from his car when I slam my palms into his chest. He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. The urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands in the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国歌完毕，“贡品”列队回到训练中心的住处，大家都集中到电梯旁。我小心的避开皮塔，人太多，设计师、指导老师和女伴都落在后面，选手面对面站着，没人开口说话。电梯中途停下，里面的四个选手下去后，就只剩下我自己，到了十二层，电梯门打开，这时皮塔也正好从另一部电梯里走出来。我上前一掌打在他胸口，他一个趔趄，摔倒在装着假花的丑陋花盆上，花盆应声而碎，皮塔倒在碎片上，手上立刻鲜血直流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The roar of the crowd is deafening. Peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me. When the audience finally settles down, he chokes out a quiet "Thank you" and returns to his seat. We stand for the anthem. I have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a few feet that in the viewers' heads can never be breached. Poor tragic us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="观众发出震耳欲聋的呼喊声。皮塔靠吐露爱的心声的方式，已经把其他所有人从他前进道路上清除。观众最后终于安静下来，他略带哽咽地轻轻说了声“谢谢”，然后回到座位。接着全体起立，奏国歌。我们都必须表示尊敬，高高地昂着头。这时我看到每个屏幕上都有我和皮塔的画面。我们相隔几英尺站立着，可这个距离在每个观众的眼里是永远无法逾越的距离。可怜的、悲情的我们啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The words are sinking in. My anger fading. I'm torn now between thinking I've been used and thinking I've been given an edge. Haymitch is right. I survived my interview, but what was I really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling dress. Giggling. The only moment of any substance I had was when I talked about Prim. Compare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, and I'm forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not entirely forgettable, I have my eleven in training.</div>

But then Peeta is bleeding too heavily, and Portia leads him off for medical treatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup without them. By the time we've finished, they're back. Peeta's hands are wrapped in bandages. I can't help feeling guilty. Tomorrow we will be in the arena. He has done me a favor and I have answered with an injury. Will I never stop owing him?</div>

A frigid wasteland? Above all I am hoping for trees, which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter.

<div class="line_en">The more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it eludes me. Finally, I am too restless to even stay in bed. I pace the floor, heart beating too fast, breathing too short. My room feels like a prison cell. If I don't get air soon, I'm going to start to throw things again. I run down the hall to the door to the roof. It's not only unlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it, but it doesn't matter. The energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape. And I'm not looking to escape, only to fill my lungs with air. I want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我越想睡着，越是睡不着。最后，我心神不宁，已经没法待在床上。我在房间里走来走去，心突突跳着，呼吸急促。房间感觉就像监狱，如果呼吸不到新鲜空气，我就又要摔东西了。我沿着楼道跑向门口，想登上房顶。门微敞着，没上锁。也许有人忘了关门，不过也没关系，电场会阻止任何因绝望而企图逃跑的人。而我并不想逃跑，只想透透气，想最后看一眼天空和月亮，因为这是比赛之前最后一个无人追杀我的夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feet reach its tiled surface I see his silhouette, black against the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol. There's quite a commotion going on down in the streets, music and singing and car horns, none of which I could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room. I could slip away now, without him noticing me; he wouldn't hear me over the din. But the night air's so sweet, I can't bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room. And what difference does it make? Whether we speak or not?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼顶晚上没有点灯，我光着脚，刚踏上瓷砖地板，就看到他黑色的侧影，背后映衬着凯匹特灯火阑珊的夜空。大街喧闹异常，音乐声、歌声、汽车喇叭声，在我房间隔着厚厚的玻璃什么也听不到。我可以溜走，不让他看到，在嘈杂声中他也不会听到我的声音。可夜晚的空气如此清新，我不能忍受再次回到憋闷的房间。说到底，我们说话不说话，又有什么关系呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

We will see how high and mighty he is when he's faced with life and death. He'll probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat someone's heart after they've killed them. There was a guy like that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus. He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players he'd killed before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, but cannibalism doesn't play well with the Capitol audience, so they tried to head it off. There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic.</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me before dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the roof. My final dressing and preparations will be done in the catacombs under the arena itself. A hovercraft appears out of thin air, just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the redheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. I place my hands and feet on the lower rungs and instantly it's as if I'm frozen. Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while I'm lifted safely inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上，我没有见到皮塔。西纳黎明前就来找我，让我简单换了件衣服，然后把我带到屋顶。我最后的着装和准备工作将在竞技场的地下室进行。一架直升机悄然出现在我们的上方，和那天我在林子里看见红发艾瓦克丝时出现的飞机一模一样。直升机上放下一个梯子，我手脚刚搭上梯子，就觉得全身像凝住了一样动弹不得，一种电流把我粘在梯子上，之后梯子缓缓升起，把我送入飞机里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I expect the ladder to release me then, but I'm still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe. "This is just your tracker, Katniss. The stiller you are, the more efficiently I can place it," she says.</div>

But that doesn't prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm.

<div class="line_cn" title="还要放这个？虽然我身体僵硬，可在她把追踪器植入我前臂皮下的时候，我仍感到一阵刺痛。现在无论我到哪，大赛组织者都能找到我的踪迹。他们可不想失去一个“贡品”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as the tracker's in place, the ladder releases me. The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof. An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out. Despite the tension in my stomach, I eat as much as I can, although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me. I'm so nervous, I could be eating coal dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond. This is what birds see. Only they're free and safe. The very opposite of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟踪器一装好，梯子就把我释放了。白衣女人消失了，直升机接上楼顶的西纳。一个男艾瓦克丝进来，引领我们来到一个房间，在那已摆放好我们的早饭。尽管我的肚子仍觉得不舒服，我还是尽量多吃些，吃得什么也没太深刻的印象。此时我紧张极了，吃煤灰都没感觉。唯一能使我分神的是飞机穿越城市时窗外的景致，和在机上看到的荒野。这里是只有鸟才能看到的景象，只不过鸟是自由而安全的，我却正好相反。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out, suggesting that we're nearing the arena. The hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go back to the ladder, only this time it leads down into a tube underground, into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena. We follow instructions to my destination, a chamber for my preparation. In the Capitol, they call it the Launch Room. In the districts, it's referred to as the Stockyard. The place animals go before slaughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="飞机飞行了约半个小时，之后窗户被遮挡起来。这意味着我们已经接近了竞技场。直升机着陆后，我和西纳再次来到梯子旁。这次不同的是梯子连接着一个地下管道，直通地下室。我们按指示来到最终的等候地点――一个用于准备的小屋。在凯匹特，人们叫它“出发室”。在我们区，人们叫它牲畜栏，也就是是牲畜待宰前所呆的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then the clothes arrive, the same for every tribute. Cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know what will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the undergarments, simple tawny pants, light green blouse, sturdy brown belt, and thin, hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs. "The material in the jacket's designed to reflect body heat. Expect some cool nights," he says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刷牙时，尽量不让满肚子的食物漾出来。西纳把我的头发梳成标志性的一根长辫，背在身后。接着有人送来了衣服，每个“贡品”的都一样。西纳对我的服装没有发言权，他甚至不知道袋子里装着什么。可他还是帮我穿好衣服：贴身内衣、朴素的茶色裤子、淡绿色上衣、结实的棕色皮带、垂到我大腿跟的黑色帽衫。“这种夹克的面料设计可以反射体温，也许晚上会很冷。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
