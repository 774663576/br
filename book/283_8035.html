<div class="line_en">The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛就想增长她这位小朋友的才智，便让她多看些有益的书籍，多听些有益的谈话，但每次充其量只是读上开头几章，然后就推到明天再说。比较起来，闲聊比读书容易得多，凭借想象来安排哈丽特的命运，比辛辛苦苦地开阔她的眼界，培养她的分析能力，要轻松愉快得多。眼下哈丽特唯一要动笔的事情，或者说要为晚年到来所做的的唯一的心理准备，就是搜集各种各样的谜语，把它们写到一个用热压纸制作的四开簿本上。这个簿本是爱玛装订的，里面饰有数码和纪念品图案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奈特利先生可以跟爱玛争吵，爱玛却不能责怪自己。奈特利先生很不高兴，过了好久才又来到哈特菲尔德。两人见面时，奈特利先生板着个脸，说明他还没有原谅爱玛。爱玛有些忐忑不安，但是并不后悔。恰恰相反，后几天的事态越来越证明她的计划和举动是正确的，她也越发感到得意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. `So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.' And it always ended in `Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.'</div>

<div class="line_en">In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在如今这个人人喜欢文学的时代，如此大张旗鼓地搜集谜语并不罕见。戈达德太太学校里的首席教师纳什小姐至少抄录了三百条谜语。哈丽特小姐先从她那里得到了启示，希望在伍德豪斯小姐的帮助下，能收集到更多的谜语。爱玛帮助她编写、回忆和挑选，加上哈丽特写得一手好字，这个集子也许要成为最棒的，不仅谜语多，而且式样精美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade:</div>

I have read worse charades. Courtship -- a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This is feeling your way.

Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration, independence, a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.

<div class="line_en">`He appears rough to you,' said Emma, `because you are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father. The children are all fond of him.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得他粗暴，”爱玛说，“因为你自己非常和蔼。你要是拿他跟别的爸爸比一比，就会觉得他并不粗暴。他希望自己的孩子生龙活虎，他们不乖的时候，他偶尔也会骂上一两句，小过他可足个慈父——约翰·奈特利先生的确是个慈父，孩子们个个喜欢他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.</div>

<div class="line_en">`Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged -- she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it -</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused; said something about `honour,' -- glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said, `You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃尔顿先生真不知道说什么好。他看上去满腹疑惑——十分困窘，说了一声“不胜荣幸”之类的话，看看爱玛，瞧瞧哈丽特，随即望见了桌上的集子，拿起来仔细端详。爱玛有意要打消这尴尬局面，便笑吟吟地说道：“你一定要代我向你的朋友表示歉意。不过，这么好的字谜也不能只让一两个人知道。他写得这么缠绵多情，定会博得所有女人的喜欢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说完这话，他就急忙走了。爱玛也巴不得他快走，虽说他有很多讨人喜欢的地方，但他说起话来有些咋咋呼呼，真让她忍俊不禁。她跑到一旁去笑个痛快，让哈丽特沉浸在温馨、美妙的迷梦之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`I have no hesitation in saying,' replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating a good deal while he spoke; `I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as I do -- I have not the smallest doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I see it, (looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life.'</div>
