<div class="line_en">The Mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the Badger. He seemed, by all accounts, to be such an important personage and, though rarely visible, to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about the place. But whenever the Mole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat he always found himself put off. 'It's all right,' the Rat would say. 'Badger'll turn up some day or other-he's always turning up-and then I'll introduce you. The best of fellows! But you must not only take him AS you find him, but WHEN you find him.'</div>

It's quite out of the question, because he lives in the very middle of the Wild Wood.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个，咳，我敢断定他绝不会喜欢的，”河鼠惊恐地说。“他这人很怕羞，那样做，一定会惹恼他的。连我自己都从没去他家拜访过，虽说我同他是老相识了。再说，咱们也去不了呀。这事根本办不到，因为他是住在野林的正中央。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'O, I know, I know, so it is,' replied the Rat evasively. 'But I think we won't go there just now. Not JUST yet. It's a long way, and he wouldn't be at home at this time of year anyhow, and he'll be coming along some day, if you'll wait quietly.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，是的，是的，是没什么问题，”河鼠躲躲闪闪地说。“不过我想，咱们现在还是不去的好，这会儿别去。路远着哩，况且，在这个季节，他也不在家。你只管安心等着，总有一天他会来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the winter time the Rat slept a great deal, retiring early and rising late. During his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did other small domestic jobs about the house; and, of course, there were always animals dropping in for a chat, and consequently there was a good deal of story-telling and comparing notes on the past summer and all its doings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冬令时节，河鼠很贪睡，早早就上床，迟迟才起来。在短短的白天，他有时胡乱编些诗歌，或者在屋里干点零星家务事。当然，时不时总有些动物来串门聊天，因此，谈了不少有关春夏的趣闻轶事，互通消息和意见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Mole had to be content with this. But the Badger never came along, and every day brought its amusements, and it was not till summer was long over, and cold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors, and the swollen river raced past outside their windows with a speed that mocked at boating of any sort or kind, that he found his thoughts dwelling again with much persistence on the solitary grey Badger, who lived his own life by himself, in his hole in the middle of the Wild Wood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼹鼠只好耐心等待，可是獾一直没来。他们每天都玩得很开心。夏天过去很久了，天气变冷，冰霜雨雪，泥泞的道路，使他俩长时间耽留在屋内。窗外湍急奔流而过的涨满的河水，也像在嘲笑，阻拦他们乘船出游。这时，鼹鼠才又一味惦念那只孤孤单单的灰獾，想到他在野林正中的洞穴内，独自一人过日子，多孤寂啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Such a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all! With illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant of the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in scene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession. Purple loosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it. Willow-herb, tender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow. Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if string-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair and odorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the group, then the play was ready to begin.</div>

<div class="line_en">And what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes while wind and rain were battering at their doors, recalled still keen mornings, an hour before sunrise, when the white mist, as yet undispersed, clung closely along the surface of the water; then the shock of the early plunge, the scamper along the bank, and the radiant transformation of earth, air, and water, when suddenly the sun was with them again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the earth once more. They recalled the languorous siesta of hot mid-day, deep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden shafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles along dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long, cool evening at last, when so many threads were gathered up, so many friendships rounded, and so many adventures planned for the morrow. There was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the animals found themselves round the fire; still, the Mole had a good deal of spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the Rat in his arm-chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over rhymes that wouldn't fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself and explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with Mr. Badger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是怎样的一出戏啊！当凄风冷雨拍打着门窗时，睡眼惺松的动物们安逸地躲在洞穴里，回想着日出前依旧凛冽的凌晨。那时，白蒙蒙的雾霭还没散去，紧紧地贴在水面。然后，灰色化成了金色，大地重又呈现出缤纷的色泽。动物们体验到早春下水的刺激，沿着河岸奔突跳跃的欢愉，感到大地、空气和水都变得光辉夺目。他们回想起夏日炎热的正午，在灌木丛的绿荫下昏昏然午睡，阳光透过浓荫，洒下小小的金色斑点；回想起午后的划船和游泳，沿着尘土飞扬的小径，穿越黄澄澄的田野，漫无目的地遨游；又回想起那长长的凉爽的黄昏，各路人马全都会齐，交流着友情，共同筹划明天新的历险。冬日的白昼是很短的，动物们围炉闲话时，可谈的话题多着哩。可是，鼹鼠还是有大量的空闲时间。于是，有一天下午，当河鼠坐在圈椅上，对着一炉熊熊的火，时而打盹，时而编些不成韵的诗，鼹鼠便暗下决心，独自出门去探访那座野林，说不定碰巧还能结识上獾先生哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he slipped out of the warm parlour into the open air. The country lay bare and entirely leafless around him, and he thought that he had never seen so far and so intimately into the insides of things as on that winter day when Nature was deep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off. Copses, dells, quarries and all hidden places, which had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer, now exposed themselves and their secrets pathetically, and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a while, till they could riot in rich masquerade as before, and trick and entice him with the old deceptions. It was pitiful in a way, and yet cheering -- even exhilarating. He was glad that he liked the country undecorated, hard, and stripped of its finery. He had got down to the bare bones of it, and they were fine and strong and simple. He did not want the warm clover and the play of seeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the billowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away; and with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the Wild Wood, which lay before him low and threatening, like a black reef in some still southern sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个寒冷静谧的下午，鼹鼠悄悄溜出暖融融的客厅，来到屋外。头顶上的天空如同纯钢似地发着青光。四周的旷野光秃秃，没有一片树叶。他觉得，他从来没有看得这样远，这样透彻。因为，大自然进入了她一年一度的酣睡，仿佛在睡梦中蹬掉了她全身的衣着。矮树林、小山谷、乱石坑，还有各种隐蔽的地方，在草木葱茏的夏天，曾是可供他探险的神秘莫测的宝地，现在却把它们自身和它们包藏的秘密裸露无遗，似乎在乞求他暂时忽视它们的破败贫瘠，直到来年再一次戴上它们花里胡哨的假面具，狂歌乱舞，用老一套的手法作弄他，瞒哄他。从某方面说是怪可怜的，可还是使他高兴，甚至使他兴奋。他喜欢这剥去了华丽衣妆不加修饰的质朴的原野。他能够深深地进入大地的裸露的筋骨，那是美好、强健、纯朴的。他不要那暖融融的苜蓿，不要那轻轻摇摆的结籽的青草。山楂树篱的屏风，山毛榉和榆树的绿浪翻滚的帷幕，最好离得远远的。他欢欢喜喜地朝着野林快步前进。野林正横亘在他前面，黑压压，怪吓人的，像隆起在平静的南海里的一排暗礁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was nothing to alarm him at first entry. Twigs crackled under his feet, logs tripped him, funguses on stumps resembled caricatures, and startled him for the moment by their likeness to something familiar and far away; but that was all fun, and exciting. It led him on, and he penetrated to where the light was less, and trees crouched nearer and nearer, and holes made ugly mouths at him on either side. Everything was very still now. The dusk advanced on him steadily, rapidly, gathering in behind and before; and the light seemed to be draining away like flood-water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚进野林时，并没有什么东西令他惊恐。枯枝在脚下断裂，噼啪作响，横倒的树干磕绊他的腿，树桩上长出的菌像漫画中的怪脸，乍看吓他一跳，因为它们酷似某种又熟悉又遥远的东西，可又怪有趣，使他兴奋不已。它们逗引他一步步往前走，进入了林中幽暗的深处。树越来越密，两边的洞穴，冲他张开丑陋的大口。前面后面，暮色迅速地逼拢来，包围了他；天光像落潮般地退走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was over his shoulder, and indistinctly, that he first thought he saw a face; a little evil wedge-shaped face, looking out at him from a hole. When he turned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鬼睑出现在他肩后，他一开始模模糊糊觉得看到了一张面孔：一张歹毒的楔形小脸，从一个洞口向他窥望。他回过头来正对它看时，那东西却倏忽不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He quickened his pace, telling himself cheerfully not to begin imagining things, or there would be simply no end to it. He passed another hole, and another, and another; and then-yes! -- no! -- yes! certainly a little narrow face, with hard eyes, had flashed up for an instant from a hole, and was gone. He hesitated-braced himself up for an effort and strode on. Then suddenly, and as if it had been so all the time, every hole, far and near, and there were hundreds of them, seemed to possess its face, coming and going rapidly, all fixing on him glances of malice and hatred: all hard-eyed and evil and sharp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他加快了脚步，关照自己千万别胡思乱想，要不然，幻象就会没完没了。他走过一个又一个洞口。是的！——不是！——是的！肯定是有一张尖尖的小脸，一对恶狠狠的眼睛，在一个洞里闪了一下，又没了。他迟疑了一下，又壮着胆子，强打精神往前走。可是突然间，远远近近几百个洞里都钻出一张脸，忽而显现，忽而消失，所有的眼睛都凶狠、邪恶、锐利，一齐用恶毒、敌对的眼光盯住他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Very faint and shrill it was, and far behind him, when first he heard it; but somehow it made him hurry forward. Then, still very faint and shrill, it sounded far ahead of him, and made him hesitate and want to go back. As he halted in indecision it broke out on either side, and seemed to be caught up and passed on throughout the whole length of the wood to its farthest limit. They were up and alert and ready, evidently, whoever they were! And he-he was alone, and unarmed, and far from any help; and the night was closing in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乍听到时，那声音很微弱，很尖细，在他身后很远很远的地方响起，不知怎的却促使他急急朝前赶。然后，仍旧很微弱很尖细的哨音，都在他前面很远很远的地方响起，使他踟蹰不前，想退回去。正当他犹豫不决站着不动时，哨音突然在他两侧响起来，像是一声接一声传递过去，穿过整座树林，直到最远的边缘。不管那是些什么东西，它们显然都警觉起来，准备好迎敌。可他却孤单一人，赤手空拳，孤立无援。而黑夜，已经迫近了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the whistling began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，开始出现了哨音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought it was only falling leaves at first, so slight and delicate was the sound of it. Then as it grew it took a regular rhythm, and he knew it for nothing else but the pat-pat-pat of little feet still a very long way off. Was it in front or behind? It seemed to be first one, and then the other, then both. It grew and it multiplied, till from every quarter as he listened anxiously, leaning this way and that, it seemed to be closing in on him. As he stood still to hearken, a rabbit came running hard towards him through the trees. He waited, expecting it to slacken pace, or to swerve from him into a different course. Instead, the animal almost brushed him as it dashed past, his face set and hard, his eyes staring. 'Get out of this, you fool, get out!' the Mole heard him mutter as he swung round a stump and disappeared down a friendly burrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，他以为那只不过是落叶声，因为声音很轻很细。后来，声音渐渐响了，而且发出一种有规律的节奏。他明白了，这不是别的，只能是小脚爪踩在地上发出的啪嗒声，不过声音离得还远。到底是在前面还是在后面？开头像在前面，过后又像在后面，再后来像前后都有。他焦虑不安地时而听听这边，时而听听那边，声音变得越来越响，越来越杂乱，从四面八方朝他逼拢。他站着不动，侧耳倾听。突然，一只兔子穿过树林朝他奔来。他等着，指望兔子放慢脚步，或者拐向别处。可是，兔子从他身边冲过，几乎擦到了他身上，他脸色阴沉，瞪着眼睛、“滚开，你这个笨蛋，滚！”兔子绕过一个树桩时，鼹鼠听到他这样咕噜了一声，然后便钻进邻近一个洞穴，不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The pattering increased till it sounded like sudden hail on the dry leaf-carpet spread around him. The whole wood seemed running now, running hard, hunting, chasing, closing in round something or -- somebody? In panic, he began to run too, aimlessly, he knew not whither. He ran up against things, he fell over things and into things, he darted under things and dodged round things. At last he took refuge in the deep dark hollow of an old beech tree, which offered shelter, concealment-perhaps even safety, but who could tell? Anyhow, he was too tired to run any further, and could only snuggle down into the dry leaves which had drifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for a time. And as he lay there panting and trembling, and listened to the whistlings and the patterings outside, he knew it at last, in all its fullness, that dread thing which other little dwellers in field and hedgerow had encountered here, and known as their darkest moment-that thing which the Rat had vainly tried to shield him from-the Terror of the Wild Wood!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脚步声越来越响，如同骤落的冰雹，打在他四周的枯枝败叶上。整座树林仿佛都在奔跑，拼命狂奔，追逐，四下里包抄围捕什么东西，也许是什么人？他惊恐万状，撒腿就跑，漫无目的不明方向地乱跑。他忽而撞上什么东西，忽而摔倒在什么东西上，忽而落到什么东西里，忽而从什么东西下面窜过，忽而又绕过什么东西。末了，他在一株老山毛榉树下一个深深的黑洞里找到了庇护所。这个洞给了他隐蔽藏身处——说不定还能给他安全，可谁又说得准呢？反正，他实在太累，再也跑不动了。他只能蜷缩在被风刮到洞里的枯叶里，希望能暂时避避难、他躺在那里，大口喘气，浑身哆嗦，听着外面的哨声和脚步声，他终于恍然大悟。原来，其他的田间和篱下的小动物最害怕见到的那种可怕的东西，河鼠曾煞费苦心防止他遇上的那种可怕的东西，就是——野林的恐怖！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Rat left the house, and carefully examined the muddy surface of the ground outside, hoping to find the Mole's tracks. There they were, sure enough. The goloshes were new, just bought for the winter, and the pimples on their soles were fresh and sharp. He could see the imprints of them in the mud, running along straight and purposeful, leading direct to the Wild Wood.</div>

His paper of half-finished verses slipped from his knee, his head fell back, his mouth opened, and he wandered by the verdant banks of dream-rivers. Then a coal slipped, the fire crackled and sent up a spurt of flame, and he woke with a start. Remembering what he had been engaged upon, he reached down to the floor for his verses, pored over them for a minute, and then looked round for the Mole to ask him if he knew a good rhyme for something or other.</div>

Here and there wicked little faces popped out of holes, but vanished immediately at sight of the valorous animal, his pistols, and the great ugly cudgel in his grasp; and the whistling and pattering, which he had heard quite plainly on his first entry, died away and ceased, and all was very still. He made his way manfully through the length of the wood, to its furthest edge; then, forsaking all paths, he set himself to traverse it, laboriously working over the whole ground, and all the time calling out cheerfully, 'Moly, Moly, Moly! Where are you? It's me-it's old Rat!'</div>

We river-bankers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to come, we come in couples, at least; then we're generally all right. Besides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we understand all about and you don't, as yet. I mean passwords, and signs, and sayings which have power and effect, and plants you carry in your pocket, and verses you repeat, and dodges and tricks you practise; all simple enough when you know them, but they've got to be known if you're small, or you'll find yourself in trouble.

<div class="line_en">The Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw the wood that had been so dreadful to him in quite a changed aspect. Holes, hollows, pools, pitfalls, and other black menaces to the wayfarer were vanishing fast, and a gleaming carpet of faery was springing up everywhere, that looked too delicate to be trodden upon by rough feet. A fine powder filled the air and caressed the cheek with a tingle in its touch, and the black boles of the trees showed up in a light that seemed to come from below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼹鼠也钻出来，蹲在他身旁。他向外望去，只见那座曾经吓得他失魂落魄的树林，完全变了样。洞穴、坑洼、池塘、陷阱，以及其他一些恐吓过路人的东西，统统迅速消失了。一层晶莹闪光的仙毯，蒙盖了整个地面，这仙毯看上去太纤巧了，粗笨的脚都不忍往上踩。漫天飘洒着细细的粉末，碰到脸上，痒痒的，怪舒服。黝黑的树干，仿佛被一片来自地下的光照亮，显得清晰异常。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It did indeed. The Mole would not have known that it was the same wood. However, they set out bravely, and took the line that seemed most promising, holding on to each other and pretending with invincible cheerfulness that they recognized an old friend in every fresh tree that grimly and silently greeted them, or saw openings, gaps, or paths with a familiar turn in them, in the monotony of white space and black tree-trunks that refused to vary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实如此。鼹鼠简直认不出，这就是原来那座树林了。不过，他们还是勇敢地上路了。他们选择了一条看似最有把握的路线，互相搀扶着，装出一副所向无敌的兴冲冲的样子，每遇见一株阴森沉默的新树，就认作是一位老相识，或者面对那白茫茫的一片雪野和千篇一律的黑色树干，都硬装作是看到了熟悉的空地、豁口或通道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Well, well, it can't be helped,' said the Rat, after pondering. 'We must make a start, and take our chance, I suppose. The worst of it is, I don't exactly know where we are. And now this snow makes everything look so very different.'</div>

<div class="line_en">An hour or two later-they had lost all count of time-they pulled up, dispirited, weary, and hopelessly at sea, and sat down on a fallen tree-trunk to recover their breath and consider what was to be done. They were aching with fatigue and bruised with tumbles; they had fallen into several holes and got wet through; the snow was getting so deep that they could hardly drag their little legs through it, and the trees were thicker and more like each other than ever. There seemed to be no end to this wood, and no beginning, and no difference in it, and, worst of all, no way out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约莫过了一两个钟头——他们已完全失去了时间概念——他们停了下来，又沮丧，又倦乏，又迷惘，在一根横倒的树干上坐了下来，喘口气，考虑下一步该怎么办。他们已累得浑身酸痛，摔得皮破血流；他们好几次掉进洞里，弄得浑身湿透。雪已经积得很厚很厚，小小的腿几乎拔不出来。树越来越稠密，也越来越难以区分。树林仿佛无边无际，没有尽头，也没有差别，最糟的是，没有一条走出树林的路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell, where they hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and a protection from the keen wind and the whirling snow.

<div class="line_en">'We can't sit here very long,' said the Rat. 'We shall have to make another push for it, and do something or other. The cold is too awful for anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for us to wade through.' He peered about him and considered. 'Look here,' he went on, 'this is what occurs to me. There's a sort of dell down here in front of us, where the ground seems all hilly and humpy and hummocky. We'll make our way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter, a cave or hole with a dry floor to it, out of the snow and the wind, and there we'll have a good rest before we try again, for we're both of us pretty dead beat. Besides, the snow may leave off, or something may turn up.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们不能久坐，”河鼠说。“得再加把劲，采取点别的措施。天太冷了，雪很快就会积得更深，咱们趟不过去了。”他朝四周张望，想了一阵，接着说：“瞧，我想到这么一个办法：前面有一块谷地，那儿有许多小山包、小丘冈。咱们去那儿找一处隐蔽的地方，一个有干地面的洞穴什么的，避避风雪。咱们先在那儿好好休息一阵子，再想法走出树林。咱们都累得够呛了。再说，雪说不定会停下来，或者会出现什么别的情况。”">查看中文翻译</div>
