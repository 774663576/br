<div class="line_en">Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all the bones in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting upon it.</div>

Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand.

Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric's Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no wand.

<div class="line_en">Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has lived in Godric's Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra's death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric's Hollow who was on speaking terms with Dumbledore's mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个这样容易满足的朋友是巴希达·巴沙特，著名魔法史专家，在戈德里克山谷住了许多年。当然，她第一次来欢迎这家人时，曾被坎德拉拒之门外。但几年之后，这位作家派猫头鹰给在霍格沃茨的阿不思送了封信，表示很欣赏他在《今日变形术》上发表的那篇关于跨物种变形的论文。这初次接触发展成与邓布利多全家的交情。坎德拉去世之前，巴希达是戈德里克山谷惟一能与邓布利多的母亲说上话的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For, though her first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like "Dogbreath" Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of her "ill health."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，如果不是在安慰他那顽劣的弟弟，阿不思在干什么呢？答案似乎是：在确保继续囚禁他妹妹。因为，第一任看守死后，阿利安娜·邓布利多可怜的处境并没有改变。她的存在仍然只有几个外人知道，他们像“狗狗”多吉一样，能够相信他“身体不好”的说法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra's premature death down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her "frail" and "delicate." On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore's life. Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像整个巫师界一样，巴希达把坎德拉的早逝归结为“回火咒”，这是阿不思和阿不福思多年中一口咬定的故事。巴希达还重复着那家人关于阿利安娜的说法，称她“体弱多病”。但在有一点上，巴希达完全对得起我辛辛苦苦搞来的吐真剂，因为她知道阿不思·邓布利多一生中最不为人知的一切都产生了疑问：包括他对黑魔法的憎恶，他反对压迫麻瓜的立场，甚至包括他对家人的关爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. "The fire's lit, but the cauldron's empty," as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek's slightly earthier phrase, "She's nutty as squirrel poo." Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story.</div>

Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES' OWN GOOD -- this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你提到巫师统治是为了麻瓜自身的利益——我认为这是关键的一点。是的，我们被赋予能力，是的，这能力赋予我们统治的权力，但它同时包含了对被统治者的责任。我们必须强调这一点，并以此作为事业的基石。遭到反对时（那是必然会有的），它必须成为我们所有论辩的基础。我们争取统治是为了更伟大的利益。因此，当遇到抵抗时，我们只能使用必要的武力，而不能过当。（这就是你在德姆斯特朗犯的错误！但我不该抱怨，因为如果你没被开除，你我就无缘见面了。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended Ariana Dumbledore's funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister's death? Was it, as "Batty" pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours after the girl's death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场棺材旁的可怕争斗只有少数参加阿利安娜·邓布利多的葬礼的人知道，它提出了几个问题。阿不福思·邓布利多究竟为何把妹妹的死怪罪于阿不思呢？是不是真如巴希达所说，只是悲伤过度？他的愤怒会不会有一些更具体的原因呢？曾因袭击同学险出人命而被学校开除的格林德沃在那女孩死亡后不到二十四小时就逃离英国，而阿不思（出于羞耻还是恐惧？）也没再见过他，直到在魔法界多次呼吁之下才被迫与之相会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it," says Bathilda. "It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是可怜的小阿利安娜之死引起的，我想，”巴希达说，此事发生得非常突然，盖勒特当时在他们家。那天他失魂落魄地回到我屋里，跟我说他明天就想回家。盖勒特心情遭透了。于是我弄了个门钥匙，那是我最后一次见到他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Albus was beside himself at Ariana's death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. They had lost everybody except each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus's nose at the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughter's body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral… He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald.

Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met?</div>
