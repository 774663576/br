<div class="line_en">One of Mariam's earliest memories was the sound of a wheelbarrow's squeaky iron wheels bouncing over rocks. The wheelbarrow came once a month, filled with rice, flour, tea, sugar, cooking oil, soap, toothpaste. It was pushed by two of Mariam's half brothers, usually Muhsin and Ramin, sometimes Ramin and Farhad. Up the dirt track, over rocks and pebbles, around holes and bushes, the boys took turns pushing until they reached the stream. There, the wheelbarrow had to be emptied and the items hand-carried across the water. Then the boys would transfer the wheelbarrow across the stream and load it up again. Another two hundred yards of pushing followed, this time through tall, dense grass and around thickets of shrubs. Frogs leaped out of their way. The brothers waved mosquitoes from their sweaty faces.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound of the wheelbarrow drew Mariam and Nana outside. Mariam would always remember Nana the way she looked on Ration Day: a tall, bony, barefoot woman leaning in the doorway, her lazy eye narrowed to a slit, arms crossed in a defiant and mocking way. Her short-cropped, sunlit hair would be uncovered and uncombed. She would wear an ill-fitting gray shirt buttoned to the throat. The pockets were filled with walnut-sized rocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="独轮车的声音将娜娜和玛丽雅姆引到屋外。玛丽雅姆将会永远记得他们送东西来时娜娜的样子：一个高高瘦瘦的女人，赤着脚斜倚在门口，她那只视力不佳的眼睛眯成一道缝，双手抱胸，满脸戒备和嘲弄的神色。她的头发剪得很短，不包头巾，也不加梳理，就袒露在阳光之下。她会穿着不合身的衬衣，纽扣直扣到喉咙。口袋里装满胡桃大小的石块。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boys sat by the stream and waited as Mariam and Nana transferred the rations to the kolba. They knew better than to get any closer than thirty yards, even though Nana's aim was poor and most of the rocks landed well short of their targets. Nana yelled at the boys as she carried bags of rice inside, and called them names Mariam didn't understand. She cursed their mothers, made hateful faces at them. The boys never returned the insults.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩们坐在山溪旁边，等待玛丽雅姆和娜娜把供给品搬进泥屋。尽管娜娜的准头很差，而且多数石头离目标还很远就落地了，但他们知道最好别接近泥屋三十米之内。娜娜一边把一袋袋的大米往屋里搬，一边大声咒骂那些男孩，用一些玛丽雅姆听不懂的名字称呼他们。她辱骂他们的母亲，对他们黑口黑面。男孩们从来不回应她的侮辱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam felt sorry for the boys. How tired their arms and legs must be, she thought pityingly, pushing that heavy load. She wished she were allowed to offer them water. But she said nothing, and if they waved at her she didn't wave back. Once, to please Nana, Mariam even yelled at Muhsin, told him he had a mouth shaped like a lizard's ass -- and was consumed later with guilt, shame, and fear that they would tell Jalil. Nana, though, laughed so hard, her rotting front tooth in full display, that Mariam thought she would lapse into one of her fits. She looked at Mariam when she was done and said, "You're a good daughter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆觉得很对不起这些男孩。推这么重的东西，她怜悯地想，他们的手脚肯定累坏了。她希望娜娜允许她送水给他们喝。但她什么也没有说，而且如果他们对她挥手道别的话，她也不会向他们挥手。有一次，为了让娜娜高兴，玛丽雅姆甚至还骂了穆哈辛，说他的嘴巴像蜥蜴的屁股——但是后来她悔恨不已，害怕他们会告诉扎里勒。不过娜娜笑得很开心，笑得她那蛀蚀的门牙全都露出来了，笑得玛丽雅姆害怕她的病痛又会再次发作。玛丽雅姆骂完之后，娜娜看着她说：“你真是一个乖女儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">IN THE MORNINGS, they awoke to the distant bleating of sheep and the high-pitched toot of a flute as Gul Daman's shepherds led their flock to graze on the grassy hillside. Mariam and Nana milked the goats, fed the hens, and collected eggs. They made bread together. Nana showed her how to knead dough, how to kindle the tandoor and slap the flattened dough onto its inner walls. Nana taught her to sew too, and to cook rice and all the different toppings: shalqam stew with turnip, spinach sabzi, cauliflower with ginger.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nana made no secret of her dislike for visitors -- and, in fact, people in general -- but she made exceptions for a select few. And so there was Gul Daman's leader, the village arbab, Habib Khan, a small-headed, bearded man with a large belly who came by once a month or so, tailed by a servant, who carried a chicken, sometimes a pot of kichiri rice, or a basket of dyed eggs, for Mariam.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Mariam's favorite, other than Jalil of course, was Mullah Faizullah, the elderly village Koran tutor, its akhund. He came by once or twice a week from Gul Daman to teach Mariam the five daily namaz prayers and tutor her in Koran recitation, just as he had taught Nana when she'd been a little girl. It was Mullah Faizullah who had taught Mariam to read, who had patiently looked over her shoulder as her lips worked the words soundlessly, her index finger lingering beneath each word, pressing until the nail bed went white, as though she could squeeze the meaning out of the symbols. It was Mullah Faizullah who had held her hand, guided the pencil in it along the rise of each alef, the curve of each beh, the three dots of each seh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但玛丽雅姆最喜欢的人——当然，除了扎里勒之外——是法苏拉赫毛拉。他是一个老人，村里的阿訇，也就是讲解《古兰经》的法师。他每个星期从古尔德曼村过来一两次，教玛丽雅姆每日五次的朝拜仪式，教她背诵《古兰经》的段落。娜娜小时候，他也曾这样教过她。正是法苏拉赫毛拉教会玛丽雅姆识字，他总是耐心而专注地看着她的嘴唇无声地念出那些字词，看着她的食指在每个字下面移动，看着她用力地压得指甲发白，仿佛这样她就能把那些字眼的意义给挤出来。正是法苏拉赫毛拉握着她的手，教她用铅笔写出第一个波斯字母向上的一撇，第二个波斯字母的一弯，第三个波斯字母的三点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there was a rotund, old woman that Nana called Bibi jo, whose late husband had been a stone carver and friends with Nana's father. Bibi jo was invariably accompanied by one of her six brides and a grandchild or two. She limped and huffed her way across the clearing and made a great show of rubbing her hip and lowering herself, with a pained sigh, onto the chair that Nana pulled up for her. Bibi jo too always brought Mariam something, a box of dishlemeh candy, a basket of quinces. For Nana, she first brought complaints about her failing health, and then gossip from Herat and Gul Daman, delivered at length and with gusto, as her daughter-in-law sat listening quietly and dutifully behind her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后还有一位胖乎乎的老太婆，娜娜叫她亲爱的碧碧；她最后一任丈夫当过石匠，是娜娜父亲的朋友。亲爱的碧碧每次来的时候，总是带着她六个儿媳中的一个，还有一两个孙子。她气喘吁吁，蹒跚地穿过空地，猛力揉揉她的屁股，沉重地叹一口气，矮身坐在娜娜拉给她的椅子上。亲爱的碧碧也总是给玛丽雅姆带来一些礼物，一盒糖果，一篮子榅桲之类的。至于她带给娜娜的东西，先是一连串抱怨，诉说自己的健康每况愈下，再就是来自赫拉特和古尔德曼村的流言蜚语，手舞足蹈地说个不停，而她的儿媳则会坐在她身后，虔敬地静静聆听。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a gaunt, stooping old man with a toothless smile and a white beard that dropped to his navel. Usually, he came alone to the kolba, though sometimes with his russet-haired son Hamza, who was a few years older than Mariam. When he showed up at the kolba, Mariam kissed Mullah Faizullah's hand -- which felt like kissing a set of twigs covered with a thin layer of skin -- and he kissed the top of her brow before they sat inside for the day's lesson. After, the two of them sat outside the kolba, ate pine nuts and sipped green tea, watched the bulbul birds darting from tree to tree. Sometimes they went for walks among the bronze fallen leaves and alder bushes, along the stream and toward the mountains. Mullah Faizullah twirled the beads of his tasbeh rosary as they strolled, and, in his quivering voice, told Mariam stories of all the things he'd seen in his youth, like the two-headed snake he'd found in Iran, on Isfahan's Thirty-three Arch Bridge, or the watermelon he had split once outside the Blue Mosque in Mazar, to find the seeds forming the words Allah on one half, Akbar on the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是一个形容枯槁的驼背老人，总是微笑着，露出没有牙齿的嘴巴，还留着长及肚脐的白胡子。他通常会一个人到泥屋来，不过有时也会带着他那个黄头发的儿子哈姆萨，他比玛丽雅姆大几岁。当法苏拉赫毛拉来到泥屋时，玛丽雅姆会亲吻他的手——感觉就像亲吻两根蒙着一层薄皮的树枝；他则会亲亲她的额头，然后在屋里坐下，开始一天的功课。功课结束后，他们两个坐在泥屋外面，吃松子，喝绿茶，看着夜莺从一棵树扑向另一棵树。有时候他们会沿着山溪，在青铜色的落叶和低矮的桤木丛中漫步，向群山走去。他们漫步的时候，法苏拉赫毛拉会转动念珠，用他那颤抖的声音给玛丽雅姆讲故事，说起他年轻时见过的各种东西。比如他在伊朗见到的一条双头蛇，那是在伊斯法罕[1]的三十三拱桥上看到的；还有那个西瓜，有一次，他在马扎[2]的蓝色清真寺外面把一个西瓜劈成两半，发现其中一半的西瓜籽排出了“真主”的字样，另外一半的西瓜籽则排成“伟大”的字样。【注：[1]Isfahan，伊朗城市。[2]Mazar，阿富汗北部城市。】">查看中文翻译</div>

Since then, thoughts of classrooms and teachers had rattled around Mariam's head, images of notebooks with lined pages, columns of numbers, and pens that made dark, heavy marks.
