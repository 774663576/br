<div class="line_en">"Dick! Dick!" Danny cried out. He was trying to support his mother, help her over to the snowmobile. The clothes he had carried out for the two of them were scattered between where they had fallen and where they now stood. Hallorann was suddenly aware that the woman was in her nightclothes, Danny jacketless, and it was no more than ten above zero.</div>

<div class="line_en">The roar shook the whole facade of the hotel. Glass belched out onto the snow and twinkled there like jagged diamonds. The hedge dog, which had been approaching Danny and his mother, recoiled away from it, its green and shadow-marbled ears flattening, its tail coming down between its legs as its haunches flattened abjectly. In his head, Hallorann heard it whine fearfully, and mixed with that sound was the fearful, confused yowling of the big cats. He struggled to his feet to go to the other two and help them, and as he did so he saw something more nightmarish than all the rest: the hedge rabbit, still coated with snow, was battering itself crazily at the chainlink fence at the far end of the playground, and the steel mesh was jingling with a kind of nightmare music, like a spectral zither. Even from here he could hear the sounds of the close-set twigs and branches which made up its body cracking and crunching like breaking bones.</div>

Wendy's face was alabaster pale, her eyes halflidded and dazed, but she had begun to shiver.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the drift on the porch blotted the view out. A moment later they were skirting the west side of the hotel. It was still light enough to see without the snowmobile's headlight. Both upper stories were flaming now, and pennants of flame shot out the windows. The gleaming white paint had begun to blacken and peel. The shutters which had covered the Presidential Suite's picture window -- shutters Jack had carefully fastened as per instructions in mid-October -- now hung in flaming brands, exposing the wide and shattered darkness behind them, like a toothless mouth yawing in a final, silent deathrattle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门廊的雪堆随即挡住了视线。不一会儿他们就绕到了饭店西侧，四周光线充足，不用开前灯。上面两层也烧起来了，火舌吐出了窗外。闪光的白漆皮开始变黑，卷缩。总统套间窗户上的窗板——杰克遵照指示在10月中旬关好了——此时仅剩几根燃烧着的木条，暴露出后面的一大片黑暗，就像临死时无声地大张着的一张无牙的嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They began to move. He brought the snowmobile around in a circle and then they were traveling west parallel to the hotel. Hallorann cut in more to circle around behind it to the equipment shed.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had a momentarily clear view into the Overlook's lobby. The gasflame coming up through the shattered floor was like a giant birthday candle, fierce yellow at its heart and blue around its flickering edges. In that moment it seemed only to be lighting, not destroying. They could see the registration desk with its silver bell, the credit card decals, the old-fashioned, scrolled cash register, the small figured throw rugs, the highbacked chairs, horsehair hassocks. Danny could see the small sofa by the fireplace where the three nuns had sat on the day they had come up-closing day. But this was the real closing day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一瞬间，他们清楚地看到了饭店门厅的景象。从坍塌的地板中窜上来的火苗像支巨大的生日蜡烛，焰心呈鲜艳的黄色，跳动的边缘呈蓝色。那一刻，火苗似乎仅仅是在送出光明而不是毁灭。他们能看到登记台和台上的银铃，老式现金出纳机，小桌毯，高背椅，马毛跪垫。丹尼看见了壁炉边那张小沙发，他们到饭店来那天——停业日——三个修女坐在那上面。可是，今天才是真正的停业日。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy had pressed her face against Hallorann's back to cut out the wind, and Danny had likewise pressed his face against his mother's back, and so it was only Hallorann who saw the final thing, and he never spoke of it. From the window of the Presidential Suite he thought he saw a huge dark shape issue, blotting out the snowfield behind it. For a moment it assumed the shape of a huge, obscene manta, and then the wind seemed to catch it, to tear it and shred it like old dark paper. It fragmented, was caught in a whirling eddy of smoke, and a moment later it was gone as if it had never been. But in those few seconds as it whirled blackly, dancing like negative motes of light, he remembered something from his childhood… fifty years ago, or snore. He and his brother had come upon a huge nest of ground wasps just north of their farm. It had been tucked into a hollow between the earth and an old lightning -- blasted tree. His brother had had a big old niggerchaser in the band of his hat, saved all the way from the Fourth of July. He had lighted it and tossed it at the nest. It had exploded with a loud bang, and an angry, rising hum -- almost a low shriek -- had risen from the blasted nest. They had run away as if demons had been at their heels. In a way, Hallorann supposed that demons had been. And looking back over his shoulder, as he was now, he had on that day seen a large dark cloud of hornets rising in the hot air, swirling together, breaking apart, looking for whatever enemy had done this to their home so that they -- the single group intelligence -- could sting it to death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪的脸贴在哈洛伦背上避着风，丹尼则将脸贴在妈妈的背上，因此只有哈洛伦看见了那最后的东西，他没说出来。他看见一大团黑乎乎的东西从总统套间的窗户里飞出来，遮住了它后面的雪地。有那么一会儿，它的形状变成了一件巨大的难看的披风，接着，它好像兜上了风，被风撕扯成了碎片，卷进了一团旋转的青烟里，转眼之间便消失得无影无踪，好像它从来就没存在过似的。但在它像黑旋风的几秒里，他记起了孩提时代的某种东西…50年前，或更久远，他和他哥哥发现了一个大大的地蜂窝，就在他们农场的北边。蜂窝筑在地面和一棵被雷击倒的老树之间。他哥哥有一颗老式大爆竹，拴在帽带上，本来是为国庆节留着的。他点着了爆竹，扔向蜂窝，砰地一声爆炸了，挨炸的蜂窝里升起了一阵愤怒的越来越大的嗡嗡声——差不多算得上低低的尖叫声了。他们拔腿就逃，好像背后有鬼魂追来似的。哈洛伦有点相信真是有鬼，于是他回过头看，就像他现在这样。那天，他看见黑压压的蜂群在热烘烘的空气中升起来，旋转，分开，寻找着向它们的家园发动进攻的敌人，一旦发现便同仇敌忾地将它消灭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, it didn't really matter, except that looking at the racked mallets with the single missing member had a kind of fascination. He found himself thinking of the hard wooden whack! of the mallet head striking the round wooden ball. A nice summery sound. Watching it skitter across the (bone. blood.) gravel. It conjured up images of (bone. blood.) iced tea, porch swings, ladies in white straw hats, the hum of mosquitoes, and (bad little boys who don't play by the rules.) all that stuff. Sure. Nice game.

He circled the equipment shed and then pointed the snowmobile back along their trail. The Overlook was a torch now, flaming at the sky. Great holes had been eaten into its sides, and there was a red hell inside, waxing and waning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，紧紧抓住我吧！”他说。“我们还要走很远的路，但最糟糕的事已经过去了。”他开车绕过工具棚，然后上了他们过来时的那条路。远望饭店现在成了一把火炬，火光直冲天空。大楼的各面墙上都烧出了大洞，楼内更是一个红色的地狱，时而扩张，时而收缩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Danny was sitting on the snowmobile seat and Wendy was holding him weakly. His face was shiny with tears, and he was shaking as if with ague. Between his clicking teeth he said: "Where were you? We were scared!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼坐在车上，温迪无力地搂着他，他的脸上闪着泪光，身体像打摆子一样不住地颤栗着，牙齿打着战，他说：“你在哪里？我们吓坏了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a good place to be scared of," Hallorann said slowly. "Even if that place burns flat to the foundation, you'll never get me within a hundred miles of here again. Here, Missus Torrance, wrap these around you. I'll help. You too, Danny. Get yourself looking like an Arab." He swirled two of the blankets around Wendy, fashioning one of them into a hood to cover her head, and helped Danny tie his so they wouldn't fall off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是个让人担惊受怕的好地方，”哈洛伦慢吞吞地说，“就算这个地方烧成了平地，哪怕离这里不到100英里，我也不会来了。给，托兰斯太太，裹上。我来帮你，你也来一条，丹尼。把你自己打扮成一个阿拉伯人。”他给温迪缠上了两条毛毯，在其中一条上做了一个兜帽盖在她头上，然后帮丹尼拴起来，免得滑落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hedge creatures were all in their original positions, but they were denuded, blackened, seared. Their dead branches were a stark interlacing network in the fireglow, their small leaves scattered around their feet like fallen petals.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann edged through the gap between gate and post. A moment later they were on the road, pointed back toward Sidewinder. The sound of the snowmobile's engine dwindled until it was lost in the ceaseless roar of the wind. It rattled through the denuded branches of the hedge animals with a low, beating, desolate sound. The fire waxed and waned. Sometime after the sound of the snowmobile's engine had disappeared, the Overlooks roof caved in-first the west wing, then the east, and seconds later the central roof. A huge spiraling gout of sparks and flaming debris rushed up into the howling winter night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦驾车从大门和门柱间的空隙挤了过去。不一会儿，他们上了公路，向塞德温得驶去。雪地车引擎的轰鸣声渐渐远去，终于消失在狂风无休止的怒号声中。风在树篱动物光秃秃的树枝间刮过，发出了低沉、凄清的拍打声。大火时而腾起，时而萎缩。雪地车的马达声消失后的某个时候，远望饭店的楼顶塌陷了——先是西侧，然后东侧，几秒钟后，中间也塌了。一大柱的火星和余烬盘旋着升上了狂风呼啸的夜空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were still twenty miles from Sidewinder when Hallorann stopped to pour the rest of the gas into the snowmobile's tank. He was getting very worried about Wendy Torrance, who seemed to be drifting away from them. It was still so far to go.</div>

Far down the road but coming toward them, coming upward through a series of S-shaped switchbacks, was a pearly chain of lights.
