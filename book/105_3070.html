<div class="line_en">Squealing, Dylan erupted into action. She thrashed towards the shore, eyes shut, her gait clumsy because with each step she had to lift her trainer clear, shaking her ankle to get rid of anything that clung on. She mustn't look, and like the empty train carriage where this had all started, her mind filled in the blanks. She imagined things halfway between an eel and a crab with seizing claws, or a huge mouth, like a monkfish, filled with razor-sharp teeth. Nauseated and panicked, she ran on, not stopping until she heard the dry crunch of pebbles beneath her feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦一声尖叫，猛然反应过来。她闭着眼，蹚着水朝岸边走。她的步态无比笨拙吃力，因为每走一步都要完全抬起运动鞋，抖一抖脚踝免得又被什么东西缠上。她不能睁眼。她的头脑里一片空白，犹如这一切经历的起点—那节空空荡荡的车厢一样。在她的想象中，水下那东西介于滑溜溜的鳗鱼和伸着钳子的螃蟹之间，或者就像安康鱼一样，一张巨嘴里面排满了利齿。想到这些，她心里既恶心又害怕，只能一步也不停地继续走下去，直到听见自己的脚踩在鹅卵石上发出的嘎吱声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The terror of that realisation almost undid her again. Her eyes fluttered open only to see wraiths swirling round her head like a swarm of flies. She shut them again at once, but she could still feel the icy chill of the lake rippling up to her knees. Was it her imagination, or was something sliding round her ankle, coiling like a snake about to tighten? Horrified, she yanked her left foot up and out of the water, but whatever it was just moved smoothly over to her other leg. This time there was no doubt about it: there was something there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦意识到自己仍在水中，随之而来的恐惧感几乎让她慌了手脚。她猛地睁开眼看到恶魔们如一群苍蝇般在她的头顶盘旋。她赶紧闭上眼，但仍能感到冰冷的湖水在拍击着她的膝盖。似乎有什么东西正在绕着她的脚踝滑动，似一条盘旋蜷曲准备绷紧身体的蛇，这是自己的幻觉吗？惊慌失措的迪伦赶紧把左脚抬出水面，但那个东西又游弋到了她另一条腿边。这次确定无疑了—肯定有什么东西在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Out of ideas, Dylan's face screwed up in anguish and a teardrop escaped from between her tightly clenched eyelids, plummeting down and exploding on her hand. Her mouth turned down, lips trembling, and her shoulders shook as she started crying. She was stuck. Trapped. Was this how far other souls had made it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦一时没了主意。她的五官痛苦地拧成一团，一滴泪水从她紧闭的眼皮间悄然滑下，一直落到她手上绽开。她努着嘴，双唇颤抖，双肩也因为抽泣而抖动着。她被困在这里进退两难了。难道其他灵魂也都只能止步于此吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But still afraid to open her eyes, she was totally lost. There was a path up the hill, she knew, but that was in her wasteland. Not necessarily here. And even if it was, how the hell was she supposed to find it if she couldn't open her eyes?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她仍然不敢睁开眼，她彻底迷路了。她知道有一条上山的路，但那条路是在她的那个荒原里的，这里不一定会有。即使有，如果她无法睁开眼的话，又该怎么找着这条路呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Overwhelmed and exhausted, she dropped to the ground, propping herself up on all fours, and scrabbled at the stones with her fingers. Dry land, she told herself. Dry land. You're safe.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stayed there for ten minutes, ten precious minutes of daylight, before a thought occurred to her. Perhaps she could see… just so long as she didn't look.

<div class="line_en">Breathing in cautious gasps, she tentatively opened her eyes. Focusing on nothing but looking straight down, on not really looking, she waited. It took only three seconds. A wraith ducked low to the ground, skimming the pebbles, and flew straight for her face. Dylan blinked -- an automatic reaction -- but managed not to turn her gaze to the movement, to stay focused on the ground. At the last second the wraith veered off, snarling venomously in her ear as it passed, making the wind stir a loose tendril of her hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她小心翼翼地喘了几口气，试探着睁开了眼，但只敢垂着眼帘，等待着。只隔了三秒钟，一个恶魔向地面俯冲，擦着鹅卵石，然后径直向迪伦的脸飞来。迪伦本能地眨了一下眼，但是仍然尽力不去看它，只把视线放在地面上。终于，那个恶魔突然改变了方向，充满怨怼地叫了一声，从她的耳边呼啸而过，带起的风吹起了迪伦一缕头发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a better idea than staying here and waiting for the night to claim her. The dark, the cold, the screaming; that, she knew, she wouldn't survive.</div>

<div class="line_en">But one wraith was easy. Realising she'd now opened her eyes, the rest of the hovering demons tried the same approach, dive-bombing her one after another. The air was a confusing swirl of black, making it hard to see, but Dylan ignored then, getting clumsily to her feet. She had to hold her hands out for balance, disorientated by the rush of movement, and goosebumps erupted on both of her arms as the air vibrated around her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="应付一个恶魔还算容易，但迪伦发现，现在她睁开眼后，其他盘旋在她头顶的恶魔们纷纷效尤，一个个向她身边俯冲下来。一时间空气中充斥着黑色的旋涡，让视线模糊不清。但她不为所动，笨拙地站起身，不得不伸手保持身体平衡，被气流冲得辨不清东西南北，周围震颤的空气让她的两臂上一下子冒出了很多鸡皮疙瘩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Turning her head slowly left and right, she hunted out the path. It should be near the boatshed, but although the boat had been there, she couldn't see the dilapidated little hut that housed it. No shed meant no path, but did she really need it? She knew she had to go up; that should be enough. Would have to be, because the afternoon was bleeding away with frightening speed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她缓缓转头左右张望，寻找那条路。它本来应该靠近舢板棚的，尽管船还在，但她却没有看到那间摇摇欲坠的破棚子。看不到棚子就意味着找不到路，但她真的非得找到这条路吗？她知道自己要上山，这就足够了。也只能这样了，因为下午的时间正以惊人的速度流逝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eyes down, she concentrated on the slick black pebbles, then, as she moved further from the shore, the burgundy dirt ground. Tufts of plants grew up the hillside, but not the heather and long grasses she'd become used to. These were purple and black, leaves tapering to thin spikes, stems armed with jagged thorns. They smelled too, wafting up the pungent aroma of rot and decay when her jeans brushed past. Now that she was moving away from the lake, the heat attacked with renewed fervour. Her clothes dried and stiffened, stained black from the water, then they began to stick to her as sweat leeched through her skin. The top of her head was burning under the glare of the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她瞅着地面，视线集中在那些光滑的黑色石子上，然后沿着岸上深紫红色的土路向前走。山坡上长满了一簇簇植物，但不是她已经习以为常的石楠和茂盛的荒草。这些植物呈黑紫色，叶片逐渐缩成细针状，茎上满是参差不齐的刺。它们闻起来臭烘烘的，迪伦的牛仔裤一蹭到它们，就能闻到一股刺鼻的腐烂气味。她现在已经离开了湖区，热浪重新袭来。她的湿衣服变干发硬，上面那些斑斑点点的污泥开始随着流下的汗液粘在身上。她的头顶在阳光的炙烤下变得滚烫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was miserable. She couldn't breathe, she was exhausted and every few seconds the wraiths dived for her again, trying to catch her out. She didn't dare lift her head to see how far she had to go, but her legs were aching, her back sore from being bent over. Scared and in pain and spent, Dylan screwed up her face and started to cry. The wraiths cackled, as if they could sense how close she was to giving up, to succumbing, but she couldn't seem to pull herself together. The tears blurred her vision, and her route up the hill became erratic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真是苦不堪言。她无法呼吸，筋疲力尽，每一秒钟都有恶魔俯冲下来，试图抓住她。她不敢抬头看还要走多远，但是一直弓着身子走路让她腰酸背痛。现在的迪伦提心吊胆、疼痛难忍、精力衰竭，她嘴一咧又开始哭起来。那些恶魔们咯咯叫个不停，好像能觉察出她马上就要放弃抵抗，彻底屈服了。她似乎无法再振作起来了，眼泪模糊了视线，她的行走路线开始变得摇摆不定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the gravel finally gave way to the rocky floor that marked the beginning of the top of the hill, Dylan's foot kicked a stone that refused to move, and she tripped. Throwing her arms out in front of her, she gasped, focusing her gaze to see the ground come rushing towards her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脚下的碎石子路终于变成了坚硬的岩石，这说明她已经快到山顶了。迪伦突然踢到一块不肯让路的石子，脚被绊了一下，她赶忙把两臂挡在身前，喘着气，眼睛依然注视朝自己飞驰而来的地面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her hands took the brunt of her fall. Then her chest hit the path, snapping her head up. She found herself eye to eye with a wraith. There was just time to see its tiny, puckered face curl into a leer, before it dived at her and she was cold all over, as if she'd been submerged in the icy lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="倒地之后，她的双手首当其冲。接着胸口也蹭到了路上，她猛然抬起头，发现自己正与一个恶魔四目相对。一瞬间她看清了它那张皱巴巴的小脸上射来的恶毒目光。接着它就朝她俯冲了下来，迪伦顿觉浑身发冷，就像之前沉在冰湖中的那种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once she'd seen one, it seemed impossible to avoid looking at the rest, and they attacked en masse, pulling and tugging, penetrating down into her bones. With Dylan on the ground, the wraiths had already won half the battle. She felt herself sinking, sliding downwards as if the hard, compacted dirt was quicksand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要看见了一个恶魔，再想躲着不看其他的恶魔也就不可能了。它们蜂拥而至，一齐向她袭来。连拉带扯，钻入她的骨骼深处。迪伦身在地面，就先给了居高临下的恶魔们以可乘之机。她感觉自己的身体在下沉，一点一点滑下去，好像紧实的土路此刻已经变成了流沙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her legs burned, her lungs ached, and the claws of countless wraiths hooked deep into her sweat-saturated T-shirt and hair. Staring at the top of the hill, she fought against their hold. The wraiths howled and snarled, buzzing round her head like angry bees. But Dylan kept going. She reached the top and down, she knew, would be much, much easier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她感觉腿上火辣辣的，肺部一阵阵剧痛，无数恶魔的利爪勾进了她早已被汗水湿透的T恤衫里，侵入了她的头发中。迪伦盯着山顶，拼命不让它们抓住自己。恶魔们嘶吼着，如一群怒蜂围着迪伦的头嗡嗡乱飞，但迪伦仍在飞奔。她已经到了山顶，知道下山要容易多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She hadn't come this far to die now. Again, Tristan's face danced in front of her eyes, the vivid blue of his stare a perfect remedy to this bloody hell. It was like a gulp of fresh air, galvanising Dylan. With monumental effort, she got her feet beneath her and exploded upwards, throwing off the wraiths clinging to her hands, her hair. Then she ran.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她历尽千辛万苦走到现在可不是来送死的。崔斯坦的面容又一次浮现在她眼前，那双湖蓝色的眼睛是摆脱现在糟糕处境的灵丹妙药，就像吹来了一阵新鲜的空气，让迪伦一下子变得充满斗志。她极为吃力地站起身，把缠在手上和头发里的恶魔们甩了出去，然后开始飞跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, the safe house appeared. It was there, just in front of her. The incline levelled out, made it easier to control her speed. She was so close; she was going to make it. The wraiths knew it too. They doubled their efforts, soaring so close to her face she felt the wisps of their wings sting at her cheeks, wrapping around her legs to try and trip her again. Too little, too late. Dylan had the safe house to gaze upon and nothing the wraiths could do would tear her eyes away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，那间安全屋出现了，就在迪伦的前方。坡度平缓了不少，这让她能稍微控制一下自己的速度。她与小屋只有咫尺之遥，马上就要冲进去了。恶魔们自然也明白这一点，于是加紧了进攻，紧贴着她的脸盘旋着，近得她能感受到它们的小翅膀抽打在她的脸颊上。它们围着她的腿，想再把她绊倒。但它们个头太小了，为时已晚。迪伦一直凝视着安全屋，无论这些魔鬼做什么都不能转移开她的视线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, it was too easy. Too fast -- far too fast. Her feet couldn't keep up as gravity pulled her down the sheer slope. Unlike the wraiths, this was a battle she couldn't win -- and didn't want to. Instead, she let herself free fall, careering forward, concentrating on nothing more than moving her legs as quickly as possible, on staying upright. If she fell over here, she'd had it. Toppling, flailing, she wouldn't be able to think about where her eyes were focusing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下山的确是太容易了。她跑得太快了，太快太快了。她的双脚跟不上从陡峭的山坡下去时的惯性。和恶魔们搏斗她没有赢的可能—她也不打算和它们缠斗，索性让自己顺着惯性往下落，向前猛冲，除了尽全力飞跑，除了尽量站稳，她什么也不去想。如果她在这里摔倒了也就前功尽弃了。她的身体不由自主地左右摇摆，根本没时间思考视线应该集中在哪里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan flung herself round the corner of the building and burst through the door. She knew she didn't need to, but she slammed it behind her. Calm descended at once. She stood in the middle of the single room, hauling oxygen into her screaming lungs, shaking all over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦飞身绕过房子的拐角，冲进屋内。她知道自己不必如此，但还是砰的一声关上了门，耳边立刻清净了。她站在屋子中间，浑身颤抖着使劲把氧气灌进正在紧张收缩的肺部。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan rubbed her bare arms. It was more than just the cold that was making her tremble. Shadows swirled on the ground as the wraiths circled at the window. She tried to ignore them, but it wasn't easy. The sound of their wailing cut right to the centre of her brain, and with nothing else but silence in the tiny stone house, there was little to distract her ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦揉着自己裸露的胳膊。她也不全是因为寒冷才颤抖，那些魔鬼们还在围着窗子飞，它们的阴影在地面旋转。她尽力不理睬它们，但是要做到这点并不容易。它们的号叫声直接刺进了她脑中，石屋里寂静无声，实在没有什么东西能分散她的听力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She felt as exhausted, as she had after her last crossing of the lake. For a while she burned, heated from within by the panic and adrenaline that was acid in her veins, but in the dim light of the cottage, the air cooled quickly. Soon she was shaking with the chill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她感觉非常疲惫，就像刚刚划船穿过那个湖时一样。由于惊魂未定，再加上血管中过度分泌的肾上腺素，她一度感到体内热气翻涌，浑身灼热。然而在光线昏暗的小屋里，空气冷却得很快，不一会儿她就又打起寒战来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She dropped down onto one of the chairs and lifted her legs to rest her feet on the seat, resting her chin on her knees, hugging herself for warmth. It wasn't enough, though, and soon her teeth were chattering. Dylan heaved herself up and moved stiffly over to the hearth. There were no matches to get a fire going like there had been in the last safe house, but she remembered how she'd done it the last time, and how the oars had appeared in the boat. Using wood from a little basket to the side, she built a lopsided triangle and stared hard at the centre of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坐在一把椅子上，抬起腿在座位上歇歇脚，下巴靠在膝盖上，蜷缩成一团好暖和些。但这点温度还不够，很快她的牙齿开始打架。迪伦起身径直挪到壁炉前，这里不像在上一间安全屋里那样有火柴可以点火，但她想起自己以前是怎么点着火的，也想起那双桨是怎么出现在船里的。她把旁边小篮子里的木柴垒成了一个歪歪斜斜的三角形，然后全神贯注地盯着三角形的中间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing happened. Dylan shut her eyes, and thought her pathetic plea again, holding her breath and crossing her fingers. There was a snap, swiftly followed by a spitting sound. When she opened her eyes again, there were flames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="什么也没发生。迪伦闭上眼，默想着自己的哀求，屏住呼吸，手指交叉着许愿。先是传来噼啪的一声，接着是噼噼啪啪的声音。当她再次睁开眼时，火已经点着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the fire grew, the chill gradually dissipated. Slowly, the shivers racking Dylan dissolved. She wrinkled her nose as she caught the putrid stench of the lake water rising from her clothes as the fabric warmed in the heat of the fire. She felt filthy, and she could only imagine how she looked. Glancing around, she saw the big Belfast sink, the dresser. This was the safe house where she'd managed to wash her clothes before. She'd used all the soap, she knew, but even if she could just rinse them out she'd feel better. Cleaner. And this time there would be no Tristan to see her clothed in the hodge-podge, too-big outfit he'd found stuffed into one of the drawers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火慢慢变大，寒意逐渐消散，让迪伦痛苦不堪的寒战也慢慢消失了。衣服在炉火的烘烤下散发出一股湖水的恶臭，她皱起了鼻子，感觉自己污秽不堪，简直不敢想象自己现在是副什么模样。环顾四周，她看到了一个带溢流的平沿水槽，还有一个梳妆台。以前她曾在这间安全屋里洗过衣服，她记得上次已经用光了所有的肥皂，但只要能把污泥冲洗掉，比刚才干净些，也能让她感觉好得多。她在一个抽屉里找出了那套肥大的衣服，这次不用担心崔斯坦看见自己穿这件不伦不类的衣服了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you," she whispered automatically. It was uncomfortable kneeling on the cold stone floor, but she didn't move. Though the fire showed no signs of going out, it was small and gave out little heat. She had to hold her fingers just above the tiny leaping flames to feel their delicious warmth. The light, too, held her there as the shadows thickened outside. She wished there were candles to light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢！”她情不自禁地低声说道。跪在冰凉石地板上的感觉很不舒服，但她没有起身。尽管火没有要熄灭的迹象，但是微弱的火势只能发出一点点热度，她只能将手指伸在跃动的火苗正上方感受那美妙的暖意。火光也很微弱，屋外的阴影却越来越重，迪伦就守在原地，她真希望屋里能有蜡烛照明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Without Tristan's stories, it seemed to take a lot longer to fill the sink, and without the slither of soap she wasn't sure how much difference she actually made to the foul black stains coating her clothes. Still, she pounded the dirt from them as best she could and hung them on the chair backs. She put on the massive clothes from the dresser, then, ignoring the bed where she'd snuggled up tight to Tristan's warmth, she curled herself up on a scrap of faded carpet beside the fire. There was no point lying down anyway. Here, alone, with the endless howling of the wraiths outside, she was never going to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在没有崔斯坦讲故事，水槽注满水似乎要比上次的时间更久；这次也没有那一小块肥皂了，她简直不知道洗不洗那些挂满泥点子的脏衣服有什么区别。但她还是尽全力把污泥从衣服上搓掉，然后把它们晾在椅子靠背上。她穿上了衣橱里那套肥大的衣服。上次她曾在床上紧紧依偎在崔斯坦温暖的臂弯中，这次她却没有理会那张床，而是蜷缩在炉边一块褪了色的地毯上，现在躺在床上毫无意义。这里只有她一人，外面恶魔的叫声不绝于耳，她再也不会睡觉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The night dragged by. Dylan tried not to think, but let the flames lull her into a stupor, the way Tristan told her he did during the early days of the crossing when the souls still slept. It wasn't easy -- every noise made her jump, her head craning round to peer through the windows into the inky black -- but the time passed slowly until a blood-red dawn roused her. She groaned as she rolled off the rug and stood up. She'd stiffened up overnight and her muscles were screaming in pain. Awkwardly, trying to move as little as possible, she shimmied out of her borrowed outfit and eased back into her torn, half-rigid clothes. They still looked horribly grubby, but they smelled a little better, she thought, lifting the hem of her T-shirt up to her nose and sniffing cautiously. She fussed for a while over the lie of her jeans, trying to reinstate her turn-ups, to stop the sulphurous mud soaking into them quite so quickly. Then she played with her hair, trying to fasten it up into a neat bun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑夜慢慢流逝。迪伦试图清空思绪，只是看着炉火陷入恍惚。这个办法是崔斯坦告诉她的，在穿越荒原的最初几天，晚上那些灵魂入睡时他就用这个法子打发时间。要做到无思无欲并不容易—外面的每一丝声音都会让她心惊肉跳，她转头透过窗子窥探着外面墨黑色的世界。时间过得异常缓慢，终于窗外血红色的黎明让她醒过神来，她呻吟了一声离开毯子站起身。僵坐了一夜，现在她浑身的肌肉都是痛的。她笨拙地慢慢挪动，抖掉那身不合体的衣服，重新穿上自己那身又破又硬的行头。它们看起来仍然污秽不堪，但闻起来味道要好点了。她这样想着，把T恤的下摆提到鼻子前，小心地嗅了嗅。她很为自己的牛仔裤忧心忡忡了一会儿，想重新把裤脚卷起来，免得带着硫黄味的污泥轻而易举就溅在上面。接着她又摆弄了一会儿头发，想把头发扎成干净利落的发髻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She gripped the chair in front of her, seized suddenly by an overwhelming sense of panic, and squeezed her eyes shut against tears. It was no use crying; she'd put herself in this position. Go forward or go back. That was the choice. The boat was still there, now nicely beached against the shore. She could row across the lake, take refuge in the final safe house and be back across the line tomorrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然一阵难以抵挡的恐惧感袭来，她紧紧抓住身前的椅子，紧闭双眼不让泪水流出来。哭泣解决不了问题，况且她现在还面临着两难抉择—到底是向前走还是往后退。那条船还在那儿，正好就停在岸边。她可以划船回去，在最后那间安全屋里躲一晚上，明天就能重新跨过那条分界线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What she was really doing, she knew, was procrastinating. It was beyond time to step back outside, and she was wasting valuable daylight. But today was going to be hard. She'd crossed the lake, yes, but now she had to try and navigate her way across the wasteland to find the next safe house. As she saw the wasteland now, without Tristan, it was almost featureless and totally alien with its red sandstone and blackened shrubs. And she had to journey without looking at any of the other souls, their guiding orbs, or the wraiths that cloistered round them. Oh, and somehow do all this whilst looking for her own orb that may or may not look like Tristan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她知道，自己实际上是在故意拖延。现在早就过了出门的时间，她是在浪费白天宝贵的时间，然而今天肯定会凶多吉少。她已经穿过了湖区，没错，但现在她还得越过荒原找到下一个安全屋。没有了崔斯坦的陪伴，眼前的这片荒原除了红色的砂岩和黑色的灌木外几乎毫无特征，一派荒凉景象。她必须专心赶路，绝不能再去看其他的灵魂，也不能看为他们指路的光球，还有绕着他们盘旋的恶魔。哦，对了，除了躲避那些，她还得想方设法寻找属于自己的光球，它可能看上去像崔斯坦，也可能完全不像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan took one deep breath, held it, and forced herself to exhale slowly. Swallowing hard, she pushed the fear and the uncertainty away. She imagined Tristan's face when he saw her, saw that she'd come back for him. She imagined the feel of his arms around her as he hugged her close to his chest. The smell of him. Holding that image firmly in her mind, she marched across the narrow room and threw open the door. She was doing this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦深吸了一口气，屏住呼吸，然后徐徐地把气呼出来。她使劲干咽了一下，把害怕和疑惑都抛在了一边。她想象着崔斯坦看到自己、看到自己回来找他时会是什么表情。她想象着他将自己紧紧揽入怀中时他双臂的触感，还有他身上的味道。她把这些画面定格在自己的脑子里，穿过狭窄的屋子，打开了门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as she stepped outside the protective confines of the cottage, the waiting wraiths began their cruel dance; circling and diving and trying to make her look at them. She ignored them, keeping her gaze fixed on the horizon, focusing on seeing but not looking. Like staring through the windscreen of a car whilst a million raindrops were splattering on the glass. It was hard, not allowing her eyes to focus, and it hurt her head, but it was easier than staring straight down all the time. A mixture of smoking grey and burgundy, the blood-red sun had yet to fully rise. Her glazed eyes swept across the peaks and valleys, trying to pick out something she recognised -- a path, a landmark, anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她刚一离开小屋的庇护，那些等待多时的恶魔们就开始了凶残的舞动。它们绕着她盘旋，朝她俯冲，就是为了吸引她的目光。她对恶魔们置之不理，只把目光牢牢地锁定远方的地平线，好像在看向它们，实则是盯着远方。就像车上有一块挡风玻璃，无数雨点飞溅其上，隔着这块玻璃注视车外一样。要做到不让眼睛聚焦很难，这让她的头很痛，但这样总比全程一直低头盯着地面要容易多了。此时血红色的太阳混杂了烟灰色和深紫色，尚未完全升起。她迷离的眼神扫过群峰和山谷，想辨认出自己熟悉的东西—不管是道路、地标，或是其他什么都行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She made herself glance at each one, however. She had to. Because any one of them might be being guided by her orb, her ferryman. None of the pulsing balls of light called to her, though, and as soul after soul after soul passed by, her hopes began to sink. She truly was looking for a needle in a haystack.

<div class="line_en">Tristan. She might find Tristan today. That thought she repeated over and over again, a silent mantra. It gave her strength.

<div class="line_en">When the sun was at its highest in the sky, raining down fire on her, she began to pass the first of the souls walking wearily in the other direction.

<div class="line_en">It was a shock to Dylan when she came upon the safe house. She hadn't expected to be close yet, if, in fact, she was even going in the right direction. The sun was far from setting and was still searing its wrath into her brow. She was still scanning souls, but they were much less frequent now. Most were well on their way to their next refuge. The small stone cottage was almost hidden by the great shadows of two mountainous peaks that towered over it. If Dylan had been paying attention, she would have seen the deep basin beyond, and realised where she was. As Tristan had said, the valley was always there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead, the building crept up on her. Dylan cried out with relief when she saw its crumbling walls, its cracked and rotten windows. It was as unappealing as it was welcoming, and she accelerated to a jerky run, despite her aching limbs, to close the final few metres. Spent, Dylan all but fell into the door and stumbled over to the bed. Resting her elbows on her knees, she propped her chin in her hands and stared around.</div>

This was the safe house where she'd spent a day and two nights alone, waiting desperately for Tristan to come back. Just seeing the wrought-iron fireplace, the single chair that she'd sat on for a whole day, watching the true wasteland go by -- the first time she'd ever really seen it -- brought a flood of memories and emotions rushing back.
