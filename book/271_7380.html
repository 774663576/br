<div class="line_en">They ghosted closer, their black robes billowing slightly with the movement. I saw their hands curl into bone-colored claws. They started to drift apart, angling to come at us from all sides. We were surrounded. We were going to die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们幽灵般地靠得更近了，黑色的长袍因为移动而微微摆动。骨灰色的手弯曲成爪状。他们开始兵分几路，从各个角度向我们靠拢。我们被包围了，我们会死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, like a burst of light from a flash, the whole scene was different. Yet nothing changed -- the Volturi still stalked toward us, poised to kill. All that really changed was how the picture looked to me. Suddenly, I was hungry for it. I wanted them to charge. The panic changed to bloodlust as I crouched forward, a smile on my face, and a growl ripped through my bared teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，就像火焰中迸出的一道光亮，整个画面都不同了。虽然什么都没改变——沃尔图里一族仍然蹑手蹑脚地向我们靠近，随时准备扑杀。不同的只是我看这幅场景的心态。转瞬间，我渴望它。我反过来想要扑向他们，我弓身前进，惊恐变成了杀戮的欲望。扬起笑容，露出牙齿，发出嘶吼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The line of black advanced on me through the shroud-like mist. I could see their dark ruby eyes glinting with desire, lusting for the kill. Their lips pulled back over their sharp, wet teeth -- some to snarl, some to smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑色的阴影穿过弥漫的白色浓雾向我逼近。我看到他们暗红色的眼睛因为渴求而闪烁着光芒，杀人的渴求。咧开的嘴唇露出尖利，粘湿的牙齿——一些在咆哮，一些则在微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="就在这个时候，我的指尖摸到了某样平坦、光滑、钞票大小的东西。是一张对折了的纸。我拿起这张便条，走到房间另一端打开电灯开关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wiped the sweat off my forehead. I felt absolutely wide awake, though the clock on the dresser said it was after one. I knew I would never be able to sleep as hot and sticky as I felt.

<div class="line_cn" title="我抹去额头上的汗水。现在已经清醒了大半，虽然梳妆台上的时钟告诉我才刚过了午夜一点。我知道在如此湿热的环境下我是不可能睡得着的。更别提，如果我一闭上眼睛，那些鬼祟的黑影又会重返我的脑海。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我最后来到了厨房，想着可口的食物也许是我这个时候所需要的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I poked around in the fridge until I found all the ingredients for fried chicken. The popping and sizzling of the chicken in the pan was a nice, homey sound; I felt less nervous while it filled the silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把冰箱兜底翻了一遍，找到了做炸鸡的所有原料。油炸鸡时所冒出的热气和嘶嘶作响的声音听起来是那么美妙和动听。它填满了寂静的空洞，让我觉得放松了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It smelled so good that I started eating it right out of the pan, burning my tongue in the process. By the fifth or sixth bite, though, it had cooled enough for me to taste it. My chewing slowed. Was there something off about the flavor? I checked the meat, and it was white all the way through, but I wondered if it was completely done. I took another experimental bite; I chewed twice. Ugh -- definitely bad. I jumped up to spit it into the sink. Suddenly, the chicken-and-oil smell was revolting. I took the whole plate and shook it into the garbage, then opened the windows to chase away the scent. A coolish breeze had picked up outside. It felt good on my skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="炸鸡香气诱人，我直接就在烤盘里吃了起来，还不小心烫着了舌头。等咬了五、六口之后，才能够入口品尝味道。才咀嚼了两口。额——肯定坏了。我立刻跳起来将嘴里的东西吐到了水槽里。突然间，油炸鸡的气味让人反胃。我把食物连盘子一起扔到了垃圾桶里，推开窗户消散气味。凉爽的微风从外面吹了进来，感觉好些了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I opened my eyes again, the sun was halfway up the sky, but it was not the light that woke me. Cool arms were around me, pulling me against him. At the same time, a sudden pain twisted in my stomach, almost like the aftershock of catching a punch in the gut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再次睁开眼睛的时候，太阳差不多都已经当空照了，但是让我醒过来的并不是光线。我被冰凉的手臂怀抱着，紧紧地贴着他。与此同时，胃里一阵绞痛，像极了被一拳击中内脏后的后遗症。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," Edward was murmuring as he wiped a wintry hand across my clammy forehead. "So much for thoroughness. I didn't think about how hot you would be with me gone. I'll have an air conditioner installed before I leave again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很抱歉，”爱德华边念叨着边用凉凉的手抚过我汗津津的额头。“都怪我没有考虑周全。我没有想到我走了之后你会有多热。下次我再出去之前，会记得先装个空调的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was abruptly exhausted, but I didn't want to go back to the hot room. So I opened more windows in the TV room and lay on the couch right beneath them. I turned on the same movie we'd watched the other day and quickly fell asleep to the bright opening song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感觉浑身乏力，但是却不想回到那间闷热的房间。所以我打开了影音室中更多的窗户，然后躺在了窗下的躺椅上。我开始播放我们不久之前才看过的同一部电影，伴着节奏轻快的开场曲迅速地进入了梦乡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was funny how abruptly and entirely necessary this vision had become. From that first little touch, the whole world had shifted. Where before there was just one thing I could not live without, now there were two. There was no division -- my love was not split between them now; it wasn't like that. It was more like my heart had grown, swollen up to twice its size in that moment. All that extra space, already filled. The increase was almost dizzying.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd never really understood Rosalie's pain and resentment before. I'd never imagined myself a mother, never wanted that. It had been a piece of cake to promise Edward that I didn't care about giving up children for him, because I truly didn't. Children, in the abstract, had never appealed to me. They seemed to be loud creatures, often dripping some form of goo. I'd never had much to do with them. When I'd dreamed of Renee providing me with a brother, I'd always imagined an older brother. Someone to take care of me, rather than the other way around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前，我无法理解罗莎莉的痛苦和愤恨。我从来都未曾想过自己有一天会为人母，也从来不想这样。我不费吹灰之力就答应了爱德华，我不介意放弃孕育他的小孩，因为我确实不想。孩子，只存在于一种最抽象的理论中，从来都不对我有任何吸引力。他们是一群聒噪的生物，身上耷拉着黏糊的液体。我对他们向来都是束手无策。我试想过如果勒妮给我一个兄弟的话，我会希望是个哥哥。能够照顾我，而不是以其他方式缠在我身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
