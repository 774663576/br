<div class="line_en">Gant, during these years in which Helen and Luke, the two for whom he felt the deepest affection, were absent a large part of the time, lived a splintered existence at home and at Eliza's. He feared and hated a lonely life, but habit was deeply rooted in him, and he was unwilling to exchange the well-used comfort of his own home for the bald wintriness of Eliza's. She did not want him. She fed him willingly enough, but his tirades and his nightly sojourns, both longer and more frequent now that his daughter was absent, annoyed her more than they ever had before.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he remained at Dixieland as long as there was any one to listen to him, and to the bleak little group of winter boarders he brought magic. They fed hungrily on all the dramatic gusto with which, lunging back and forth in the big rocker, before the blazing parlor fire, he told and retold the legends of his experience, taking, before their charmed eyes, an incident that had touched him romantically, and embellishing, weaving and building it up. A whole mythology grew up as, goggle-eyed, they listened:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话虽如此，但只要有人喜欢听他说话，他就一直待在南都旅馆里不肯离开，冬天的时候，旅馆里房客并不多，显得很冷清，所以他常常给他们带去不少神奇的魔力。他坐在客厅的大摇椅里，面对壁炉中的火光，来回地摇晃着。他眉飞色舞地对那些房客们大谈自己的奇闻和经历，大伙都听得津津有味。他侃侃而谈，偶尔还会择取某个浪漫的片段，添油加醋般地加以润色、组织、安排。这些完整的神奇传说使他们一个个听得目瞪口呆，聚精会神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">General Fitzhugh Lee, who had reined up before the farmer boy and asked for a drink of water, now tossed off an oaken bucketful, questioned him closely concerning the best roads into Gettysburg, asked if he had seen detachments of the enemy, wrote his name down in a small book, and went off saying to his staff: "That boy will make his mark. It is impossible to defeat an enemy which breeds boys like that."</div>

He rode furiously through muttering redskin villages, and found the protection of two cattlemen in the nick of time. The thief who had entered his room at dead of night in New Orleans, and picked up his clothes, and whom he had fought desperately upon the floor, he now pursued naked for seventeen blocks (not five) down Canal Street.</div>

<div class="line_en">His eyes fixed on the clean concrete walk, Gant strode on, muttering dramatically, composing a narrative of the picture. The cold steel of new sewing-machines glinted in dim light. The Singer building. Tallest in the world. The stitching hum of Eliza's machine. Needle through your finger before you know it. He winced. They passed the Sluder Building at the corner of the Square and turned left. Gets over $700 a month in office-rent from this alone. The window on the corner was filled with rubber syringes and thermos bottles. Drink Coca Cola. They say he stole the formula from old mountain woman. $50,000,000 now. Rats in the vats. Dope at Wood's better. Too weak here. He had recently acquired a taste for the beverage and drank four or five glasses a day.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went several times a week to the moving-picture shows, taking Eugene, and sitting, bent forward in hunched absorption, through two full performances. They came out at ten-thirty or eleven o'clock, on cold ringing pavements, into a world frozen bare -- a dead city of closed shops, dressed windows, milliners' and clothiers' models posturing with waxen gaiety at congealed silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">That pure look they have, at the end, when he kisses her, mused Eugene. Later -- A Warmer Clime. Her long lashes curled down over her wet eyes, she was unable to meet his gaze. The sweet lips trembled with desire as, clasping her in a grip of steel, he bent down over her yielding body and planted hungry kisses on her mouth. When the purple canopy of dawn had been reft asunder by the rays of the invading sun. The Stranger. It wouldn't do to say the next morning. They have a thick coat of yellow paint all over their face. Meanwhile, in Old England. I wonder what they say to each other. They're a pretty tough lot, I suppose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在电影的末尾，他亲吻她的时候，那纯洁的一幕让尤金非常开心。后来——电影的情节更加刺激。她长长的睫毛垂掩住含泪的双眸，不敢睁开眼睛和他对视。在欲火中，她的双唇微微颤动着，他伸开双臂紧紧搂住她，俯身压住她柔顺的娇躯，疯狂地激吻她甜甜的嘴唇。字幕上说晨光初露。陌生人绝不会用第二天早上这样的字眼。他们的脸上全都涂上了黄色的颜料。此时此刻，在古老的英格兰，他们会相互倾诉什么呢？我觉得这一帮人都不好惹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Came a day when Spring put forth her blossoms on the earth again. No, no -- not that. Then all grew dark. Picture of a lily trampled on the earth. That means he bigged her. Art. Filled her with thee a baby fair. You can't go away now. Why? Because -- because -- her eyes dropped shyly, a slow flush mantled her cheek. He stared at her blankly for a moment, then his puzzled gaze --(O good!)-- fell to the tiny object she was fingering nervously, with dawning comprehension. Blushing rosily, she tried to conceal the little jacket behind her. Grace! A great light broke on him! Do you mean it? She went to him with a cry, half laugh, half sob, and buried her burning face in his neck. You silly boy. Of course I mean it (you bastard!). The little dance girl. Smiling with wet lechery and manipulating his moist rope of cigar, Faro Jim shuffled a pack of cards slowly and fixed on her his vulturesque eye. A knife in his shiny boots, a small derringer and three aces up his ruffled sleeve, and suave murder in his heart. But the cold gray eyes of the Stranger missed nothing. Imperturbably he drank his Scotch, wheeled from the mirror with barking Colt just one-sixth of a second before the gambler could fire. Faro coughed and slid forward slowly upon the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">They bent down eastward along Academy Street, having turned right from the little caudal appendage that gave on the northeastern corner of the Square. The boy's mind flamed with bright streaming images, sharp as gems, mutable as chameleons. His life was the shadow of a shadow, a play within a play. He became the hero-actor-star, the lord of the cinema, and the lover of a beautiful movie-queen, as heroic as his postures, with a superior actuality for every make-believe. He was the Ghost and he who played the Ghost, the cause that minted legend into fact.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene had moments of furious anger because of these demonstrations. He was angry that Gant, having eaten his cake, now howled because he had stomach-ache and at the same time begged for more. Bitterly he reflected that his father's life had devoured whatever had served it, and that few men had had more sensuous enjoyment, or had been more ruthless in their demands on others. He found these exhibitions, these wild denunciations and cowardly grovellings in propitiation of a God none of them paid any attention to in health, ugly and abominable. The constant meditation of both Gant and Eliza on the death of others, their morbid raking of the news for items announcing the death of some person known to them, their weird absorption with the death of some toothless hag who, galled by bedsores, at length found release after her eightieth year, while fire, famine, and slaughter in other parts of the world passed unnoticed by them, their extravagant superstition over what was local and unimportant, seeing the intervention of God in the death of a peasant, and the suspension of divine law and natural order in their own, filled him with choking fury.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went three times a week to Cardiac's office for treatment. The dry doctor had grown old; behind his dusty restraint, the prim authority of his manner, there was a deepening well of senile bawdry. He had a comfortable fortune, he cared little for his dwindling practice. He was still a brilliant bacteriologist: he spent hours over slides etched in flowering patterns of bacilli, and he was sought after by diseased prostitutes, to whom he rendered competent service.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他每个礼拜要去卡迪亚诊所就诊三次。这位干瘦的医生也已经老了。他看起来一本正经，举止利落，富有权威，但是骨子里却喜欢胡思乱想。他的生活很富足，因此并不在意病人的多少。他还是一位了不起的细菌专家，他会花很长时间关注显微镜载片上的花状杆菌。染病的妓女们都会登门向他求治，他也会全力以赴，应付自如。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two men became devoted friends. The doctor gave up entire mornings to the treatment of Gant's disease. The consulting-room was filled with their sly laughter while scrofulous mountaineers glared dully at the pages of Life in the antechamber. As Gant sprawled out voluptuously on the table after his masseur had finished his work, he listened appreciatively to the secrets of light women, or to tidbits from books of pseudoscientific pornography, of which the doctor had a large number.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们俩变成了好朋友。整个早晨医生都会给甘特治病。诊疗室里充满了狡黠的笑声，而外面的候诊室里坐着身患淋巴结核病的山民，他们正目光呆滞地阅读《生活》杂志。等他的按摩师结束工作以后，甘特便会舒舒服服、性感地伸展四肢躺在台子上，继续欣赏医生讲述的有关轻浮女人的神秘故事，或者听他讲一些摘自假冒科学杂志的花边新闻。这种东西医生满腹都是。">查看中文翻译</div>
