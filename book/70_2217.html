<div class="line_en">Kit gulped. He had known his father was ill, but he had never allowed himself to believe that their time together would be so limited. "Father," Kit started, sounding like a young boy. "What's happened?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Kit entered his father's bedroom. His heart pounded in his ears, and his vision blurred as his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room. The curtains had been drawn on the windows of the round chamber. The royal physician was kneeling by the king's bed, finishing his examination. Hearing Kit, the doctor stood up and moved toward the door. Kit saw the expression on the doctor's face, and he knew what it meant: the king had little time left.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they were alone, Kit strode to his father's bedside. The older man struggled to open his eyes. Upon seeing Kit, King Frederick smiled. "You've come," he said weakly. "Good."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子，这是每个人早晚都要面临的。”弗雷德里克回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not to you," Kit said, trying to boost his father's spirits, even though they both knew it was futile. "Not to my king. Not to my father. You will recover."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可不该是您，不该是我的国王、我的父亲。您会好起来的。”基特想让父亲打起精神来，可他们都知道这是徒劳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The king smiled. "You must learn to lie better than that if you will be a good statesman."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I must," the king said. "But you needn't be alone. Take a bride." When Kit began to shake his head, the king went on. "What if I commanded you to do so?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王说：“我必须走了。但你不会孤单的，你该娶妻了。”看见基特摇头，国王接着说：“如果我说这是命令呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Overwhelmed, Kit sank down on the bed, taking his father's hand in his. The hand he held was frail, the fingers thin and trembling. This was the hand that had held him when he was little. The hand that had signed peace treaties and the hand that had carried a sword. And now…"Father," Kit pleaded, tears welling in his eyes, "don't go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特无力地坐在床边，不知所措地握着父亲的手。那只手那样无力，瘦弱的手指颤抖着。就是这只手，曾在他年幼时牵着他，曾签下一纸纸和平条约，也曾高举着刀剑。可现在…“父亲，别走。”基特双眼噙泪，哀求着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That is unfair, Kit thought. But he had no desire to argue with his father on the man's deathbed. "I know that you want me to marry for advantage," Kit began.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And I will not." The words came out in a rush. "I'm sorry. I love and respect you, but I won't. I believe we need not look outside of our borders for strength or guidance. What we need is right before us. We need only…" He paused, remembering what the mystery princess had said to him when they first met. "We need only have courage and be kind to see it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而我不想这样。”他脱口而出。“我很抱歉，我爱您、敬重您，但我不想。我认为我们不必向他国寻求支持或帮助，我们需要的就在眼前，我们只要…”他顿了顿，想起了那位神秘公主初见他时对他说过的话。“我们只要坚强勇敢、仁慈善良，一切都会迎刃而解。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Silence filled the chamber. King Frederick closed his eyes, and for one moment of panic, Kit worried he had said too much. Then King Frederick's eyes opened again. And to Kit's surprise, he nodded. "Just so," the king said, pride in his voice. "You have become your own man. Good. And perhaps, in the little time left to me, I can become the father you deserve."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里一片沉默，弗雷德里克国王闭上了眼睛。一时间，基特不禁有些惊慌，担心自己说得过火了。接着，国王的眼睛又睁开了。让基特出乎意料的是，他点点头，用骄傲的口气说：“说得对，你是个有主见的人了，很好。也许在我剩下的这点时间里，我可以做个称职的父亲了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was not what Kit had expected. What did his father mean, become the father he deserved? While they didn't always see eye to eye, the king had been a loving and good father.</div>
