<div class="line_en">He made several telephone calls to Geneva. A show of Sabina's work had opened there by chance a week after the Russian invasion, and in a wave of sympathy for her tiny country, Geneva's patrons of the arts bought up all her paintings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他给在日内瓦的萨比娜打了多次电话。在俄国人入侵一个星期前，萨比娜碰巧到日内瓦办画展，瑞士那些爱画的人出于对她弱小祖国的同情，买了她展出的全部画作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He would have been only too glad to visit her, but was unable to find an excuse to explain his absence to Tereza. And so Sabina came to Zurich. She stayed at a hotel. Tomas went to see her after work. He phoned first from the reception desk, then went upstairs. When she opened the door, she stood before him on her beautiful long legs wearing nothing but panties and bra. And a black bowler hat. She stood there staring, mute and motionless. Tomas did the same. Suddenly he realized how touched he was. He removed the bowler from her head and placed it on the bedside table. Then they made love without saying a word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他巴不得去看看她，但找不到向特蕾莎解释出门的理由。于是萨比娜来到了苏黎世。她住进一家饭店。托马斯下班后去看她，他在大堂通过电话通知萨比娜，然后上楼到她的房间。她打开门，站在他的面前，修长的漂亮大腿，裸露着，除了短裤和胸罩，头上戴着一顶圆礼帽。她久久地凝望着托马斯，一动不动，一句话也没有。托马斯也呆在那里，一动不动，没有言语。随后，他发现自己是太激动了。他伸手摘下她头上的圆礼帽，放在床头柜上。两人开始做爱，还是没说一句话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had been in Zurich for six or seven months when he came home late one evening to find a letter on the table telling him she had left for Prague. She had left because she lacked the strength to live abroad. She knew she was supposed to bolster him up, but did not know how to go about it. She had been silly enough to think that going abroad would change her. She thought that after what she had been through during the invasion she would stop being petty and grow up, grow wise and strong, but she had overestimated herself. She was weighing him down and would do so no longer. She had drawn the necessary conclusions before it was too late. And she apologized for taking Karenin with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们来到苏黎世六七个月后的一天晚上，他回家晚了，到家后发现桌子上有一封信。她告诉他，她已回布拉格去。她之所以走，因为她实在没有力量在国外生活下去。她心里清楚，她在这里对托马斯来说本应是一种支持，但她知道自己没有这样的能力。当初她太幼稚了，原以为国外的生活会改变她。她以为，经历了在占领的日子里她所经历的一切之后，自己已经不再平庸，已经长大、懂事、变得勇敢，但她过高估计了自己。她成为了托马斯的负担，而这又正是她不愿意的事情。她想在不可救药之前承担后果。还请他原谅将卡列宁也带走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the fact that he carried his life-support system with him everywhere like a part of his body meant that Tereza went on having her dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，由于他总是带着自己的这种生活方式，如同割舍不了身上的阑尾，特蕾莎也就永远得做那些不变的噩梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leaving the hotel for his Hat (which by now had acquired table, chairs, couch, and carpet), he thought happily that he carried his way of living with him as a snail carries his house. Tereza and Sabina represented the two poles of his life, separate and irreconcilable, yet equally appealing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从饭店回苏黎世那个家（早些天添置了一张桌子、几把硬椅、几张扶手椅和一块地毯）的路上，他自言自语，带着一种幸福感，说他这种生活方式是走到哪儿带到哪儿，就像蜗牛驮着整个家。特蕾莎和萨比娜代表着他生活的两极，相隔遥远，不可调和，但两极同样美妙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took some sleeping pills but still did not close his eyes until morning. Luckily it was Saturday and he could stay at home. For the hundred and fiftieth time he went over the situation: the borders between his country and the rest of the world were no longer open. No telegrams or telephone calls could bring her back. The authorities would never let her travel abroad. Her departure was staggeringly definitive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他吃了药效很强的安眠药，可是直到清晨才迷迷糊糊睡着。庆幸的是，那是个星期六，他可以呆在家里。他反反复复，对形势作了估量：波希米亚与世界其他地方的边境已经封闭，与他们离开的时候已经不一样了。电报也好，电话也罢，都无法将特蕾莎唤回来。官方怎么也不会再让她离境的。对眼下的这一切，他怎么也难以相信，可是特蕾莎的出走已是无法挽回的事实。">查看中文翻译</div>
