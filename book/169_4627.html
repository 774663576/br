<div class="line_en">Thrice longships were sighted by the crow's nest. Two were well astern, however, and the Cinnamon Wind soon outdistanced them. The third appeared near sunset, to cut them off from Whispering Sound. When they saw her oars rising and falling, lashing the copper waters white, Kojja Mo sent her archers to the castles with their great bows of goldenheart that could send a shaft farther and truer than even Dornish yew. She waited till the longship came within two hundred yards before she gave the command to loose. Sam loosed with them, and this time he thought his arrow reached the ship. One volley was all it took. The longship veered south in search of tamer prey.</div>

<div class="line_en">The most perilous part of the voyage was the last. The Redwyne Straits were swarming with longships, as they had been warned in Tyrosh. With the main strength of the Arbor's fleet on the far side of Westeros, the ironmen had sacked Ryamsport and taken Vinetown and Starfish Harbor for their own, using them as bases to prey on shipping bound for Oldtown.</div>

<div class="line_en">A deep blue dusk was falling as they entered Whispering Sound. Gilly stood beside the prow with the babe, gazing up at a castle on the cliffs. "Three Towers," Sam told her, "the seat of House Costayne." Etched against the evening stars with torchlight flickering from its windows, the castle made a splendid sight, but he was sad to see it. Their voyage was almost at its end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进入低语湾时，深蓝的黄昏已经降临。吉莉抱着婴儿站在船首像边，凝视着悬崖上的城堡。“那是三塔堡，”山姆告诉她，“科托因家族的居城。”城堡镂刻在夜星之间，映衬着窗户里闪烁的火光。看着这副辉煌壮丽的景象，他却感到悲哀，因为他们的航程即将结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ironmen had penetrated even to the sheltered waters of Whispering Sound. Come morning, as the Cinnamon Wind continued on toward Oldtown, she began to bump up against corpses drifting down to the sea. Some of the bodies carried complements of crows, who rose into the air complaining noisily when the swan ship disturbed their grotesquely swollen rafts. Scorched fields and burned villages appeared on the banks, and the shallows and sandbars were strewn with shattered ships. Merchanters and fishing boats were the most common, but they saw abandoned longships too, and the wreckage of two big dromonds. One had been burned down to the waterline, whilst the other had a gaping splintered hole in her side where her hull had been rammed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁民们甚至潜入了低语湾中历来平和的水域。第二天早上，随着月桂风号继续向旧镇前进，船只开始撞到顺流入海的浮尸。有些尸体上搭载着乌鸦，当天鹅船搅动这些肿胀畸形的“小舟”时，它们便飞入空中，吵闹着抗议。岸边是焦灼的田野和焚毁的村庄，浅滩与沙洲上点缀着散架的船只，其中多数是商船和渔船，偶而也看见弃置的长船，甚至有两艘大帆船的残骸。一艘吃水线以上全被烧毁，另一艘船壳侧面有个撞裂的大洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dalla's babe began to cry. Gilly pulled open her tunic and gave the boy her breast. She smiled as he nursed, and stroked his soft brown hair.

<div class="line_en">The next day was cold and misty. As the Cinnamon Wind was creeping past another plundered fishing village, a war galley came sliding from the fog, stroking slowly toward them. Huntress was the name she bore, behind a figurehead of a slender maiden clad in leaves and brandishing a spear. A heartbeat later, two smaller galleys appeared on either side of her, like a pair of matched greyhounds stalking at their master's heels. To Sam's relief, they flew King Tommen's stag-and-lion banner above the stepped white tower of Oldtown, with its crown of flame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="次日阴冷多雾，月桂风号静悄悄地经过又一个遭遇洗劫的渔村。一艘划桨战舰从雾中驶出，缓缓地向他们划来。她的船首像是个纤瘦少女，以树叶蔽体，挥舞着长矛，船身上刻有“女猎人”的名字。片刻之后，两艘较小的划桨船出现在她两侧，仿佛紧跟在主人身边的一对灰猎犬。令山姆欣慰的是，除了旧镇海塔尔家族的顶端为烽火台的阶梯状白塔旗，船上还飘扬着托曼国王的雄鹿狮子旗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Xhondo pointed at a half-sunken longship in the shallows. The remnants of a banner drooped from her stern, smoke-stained and ragged. The charge was one Sam had never seen before: a red eye with a black pupil, beneath a black iron crown supported by two crows. "Whose banner is that?" Sam asked. Xhondo only shrugged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崇指指一艘半沉入浅滩的长船。船尾悬着一面旗帜的残骸，破破烂烂，沾染烟尘。上面的标记山姆从没见过：两只乌鸦撑起一顶黑铁冠，下面是一只黑瞳红眼。“那是谁的旗帜？”山姆问。崇耸耸肩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain of the Huntress was a tall man in a smoke-grey cloak with a border of red satin flames. He brought his galley in alongside the Cinnamon Wind, raised his oars, and shouted that he was coming aboard. As his crossbowmen and Kojja Mo's archers eyed each other across the narrow span of water, he crossed over with half a dozen knights, gave Quhuru Mo a nod, and asked to see his holds. Father and daughter conferred briefly, then agreed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My apologies," the captain said when his inspection was complete. "It grieves me that honest men must suffer such discourtesy, but sooner that than ironmen in Oldtown. Only a fortnight ago some of those bloody bastards captured a Tyroshi merchantman in the straits. They killed her crew, donned their clothes, and used the dyes they found to color their whiskers half a hundred colors. Once inside the walls they meant to set the port ablaze and open a gate from within whilst we fought the fire. Might have worked, but they ran afoul of the Lady of the Tower, and her oarsmaster has a Tyroshi wife. When he saw all the green and purple beards he hailed them in the tongue of Tyrosh, and not one of them had the words to hail him back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请原谅，”船长检查完毕之后说，“正派人不得不忍受失礼的待遇，真让我难过，但小心驶得万年船，我们不能让铁岛人混进旧镇。才两周前，那些混蛋在海峡中俘虏了一艘泰洛西商船，杀光船员后，穿上船员们的衣服，用找到的染料把胡子涂成五颜六色。一旦混进城，他们打算放火焚烧码头，趁我们忙于救火时从里面赚开城门。这计划差点成功，幸亏教塔楼夫人号撞上，她的桨手长有个泰洛西老婆，他看到那么多绿胡子紫胡子，就用泰洛西语呼喊致意，然而对方没一个人懂得如何回话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain of the Huntress gave him a curious look. "These are no mere reavers. The ironmen have always raided where they could. They would strike sudden from the sea, carry off some gold and girls, and sail away, but there were seldom more than one or two longships, and never more than half a dozen. Hundreds of their ships afflict us now, sailing out of the Shield Islands and some of the rocks around the Arbor. They have taken Stonecrab Cay, the Isle of Pigs, and the Mermaid's Palace, and there are other nests on Horseshoe Rock and Bastard's Cradle. Without Lord Redwyne's fleet, we lack the ships to come to grips with them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女猎人号的船长好奇地看了他一眼。“这些不是简单的掠夺者。铁民天生都是强盗，喜欢从海上突然袭来，抢走金钱和女人后驶回远处，一次袭击就一两艘长船，从不多于半打。然而这回不同，现在有数百艘船在侵扰我们，他们从盾牌列岛和青亭岛附近的礁石堆里驶出，夺取了石蟹礁、群猪岛、人鱼殿，甚至在马蹄岩和野种湾建立了基地。没有雷德温大人的舰队，我们对付不了他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="船长最后几句话的尖酸语气和他吐露的内容都令山姆倍感震惊。要是失去旧镇和青亭岛，整个国家就会瓦解，分崩离析，他一边寻思一边注视着女猎人号及其姐妹船离去。">查看中文翻译</div>

If he can winkle a proper fleet out of his whore of a sister, we can start paying back the ironmen with some of their own coin. Till then, the best we can do is guard the sound and wait for the bitch queen in King's Landing to let Lord Paxter off his leash."</div>

<div class="line_en">It made him wonder if even Horn Hill was truly safe. The Tarly lands lay inland amidst thickly wooded foothills, a hundred leagues northeast of Oldtown and a long way from any coast. They should be well beyond the reach of ironmen and longships, even with his lord father off fighting in the riverlands and the castle lightly held. The Young Wolf had no doubt thought the same was true of Winterfell until the night that Theon Turncloak scaled his walls. Sam could not bear the thought that he might have brought Gilly and her babe all this long way to keep them out of harm, only to abandon them in the midst of war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开始怀疑角陵是否真正安全。诚然，塔利家族的领地位于内陆树林繁茂的丘陵地带，在旧镇东北方一百里格处，远离海岸。即使他父亲大人远征三河流域，城堡守备薄弱，家里也应该不至于遭受铁民和长船的攻击。但少狼主无疑也认为临冬城是安全的，直到某天晚上变色龙席恩爬上城墙。山姆很难想象，他为了让吉莉和婴儿免受伤害，带着他们长途跋涉，最后却将他们遗弃在战场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wrestled with his doubts through the rest of the voyage, wondering what to do. He could keep Gilly with him in Oldtown, he supposed. The city's walls were much more formidable than those of his father's castle, and had thousands of men to defend them, as opposed to the handful Lord Randyll would have left at Horn Hill when he marched to Highgarden to answer his liege lord's summons. If he did, though, he would need to hide her somehow; the Citadel did not permit its novices to keep wives or paramours, at least not openly. Besides, if I stay with Gilly very much longer, how will I ever find the strength to leave her? He had to leave her, or desert. I said the words, Sam reminded himself. If I desert, it will mean my head, and how will that help Gilly?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="余下的航程中，他始终犹豫不决，不知如何是好。也许该让吉莉跟他一起留在旧镇，他心想，那儿的城墙远比父亲的城堡雄伟，难以逾越，还有数千卫兵，蓝道大人响应号召前往高庭时，或许没留几个人在角陵。倘若如此，他得设法把她藏起来；学城不许学徒眷养妻子或情人，至少不能公开。可假如我跟吉莉在一起天长日久，如何能有决心离开她？他必须离开她，不然就得做逃兵。我立过誓，山姆提醒自己，当逃兵意味着掉脑袋，这对吉莉又有什么帮助呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He considered begging Kojja Mo and her father to take the wildling girl with them to the Summer Isles. That path had its perils too, however. When the Cinnamon Wind left Oldtown, she would need to cross the Redwyne Straits again, and this time she might not be so fortunate. What if the wind died, and the Summer Islanders found themselves becalmed? If the tales he'd heard were true, Gilly would be carried off for a thrall or salt wife, and the babe was like to be chucked into the sea as a nuisance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他考虑恳求蔻佳和她父亲带野人女孩去他们的盛夏群岛。然而这条路也有危险。月桂风号离开旧镇后，需再次穿越雷德温海峡，这回也许没那么幸运。假如风停了，盛夏群岛人被困在无风的海面上怎么办？假如他听说的故事是真的，吉莉会被抓去当奴工或盐妾，婴儿则有可能因为碍手碍脚而被抛入海中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It has to be Horn Hill, Sam finally decided. Once we reach Oldtown I'll hire a wagon and some horses and take her there myself. That way he could make certain of the castle and its garrison, and if any part of what he saw or heard gave him pause, he could just turn around and bring Gilly back to Oldtown.</div>

<div class="line_en">They reached Oldtown on a cold damp morning, when the fog was so thick that the beacon of the Hightower was the only part of the city to be seen. A boom stretched across the harbor, linking two dozen rotted hulks. Just behind it stood a line of warships, anchored by three big dromonds and Lord Hightower's towering four-decked banner ship, the Honor of Oldtown. Once again the Cinnamon Wind had to submit to inspection. This time it was Lord Leyton's son Gunthor who came aboard, in a cloth-of-silver cloak and a suit of grey enameled scales. Ser Gunthor had studied at the Citadel for several years and spoke the Summer Tongue, so he and Qurulu Mo adjourned to the captain's cabin for a privy conference.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day was damp, so the cobblestones were wet and slippery underfoot, the alleys shrouded in mist and mystery. Sam avoided them as best he could and stayed on the river road that wound along beside the Honeywine through the heart of the old city. It felt good to have solid ground beneath his feet again instead of a rolling deck, but the walk made him feel uncomfortable all the same. He could feel eyes on him, peering down from balconies and windows, watching him from the darkened doorways. On the Cinnamon Wind he had known every face. Here, everywhere he turned he saw another stranger. Even worse was the thought of being seen by someone who knew him. Lord Randyll Tarly was known in Oldtown, but little loved. Sam did not know which would be worse: to be recognized by one of his lord father's enemies or by one of his friends. He pulled his cloak up and quickened his pace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气潮湿，脚下的鹅卵石又湿又滑，条条小巷全笼罩在迷雾之中。山姆尽可能避开它们，沿河边大路走，蜜酒河蜿蜒曲折，穿行于这座古老城市的中心地带。重新踩上坚实的地面，离开摇摇晃晃的甲板，感觉很美妙。然而行路之间他仍然不自在，他感到人们的视线落在自己身上，有的从阳台和窗户窥探下来，有的躲在黑暗的门洞里张望。在月桂风号上，他认识每一张脸，而这里都是陌生人。更糟的是，他担心被人认出来。蓝道·塔利伯爵在旧镇人人皆知，却不受爱戴。山姆不知哪样更糟，是被父亲的敌人认出，还是被他的朋友认出。他只能拉起斗篷，加快步伐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The gates of the Citadel were flanked by a pair of towering green sphinxes with the bodies of lions, the wings of eagles, and the tails of serpents. One had a man's face, one a woman's. Just beyond stood Scribe's Hearth, where Oldtowners came in search of acolytes to write their wills and read their letters. Half a dozen bored scribes sat in open stalls, waiting for some custom. At other stalls books were being bought and sold. Sam stopped at one that offered maps, and looked over a hand-drawn map of Citadel to ascertain the shortest way to the Seneschal's Court.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学城大门两侧有一对高大的绿色斯芬克斯像，狮身，鹰翼，蛇尾，其中一只有男人的脸，另一只为女人的脸。进门是文书台，旧镇人来这儿寻找助理学士，为他们写遗嘱，读信件。五六个文书百无聊赖地坐在开放的摊位前等待顾客。另一些摊位可以买卖书籍。山姆在一个卖地图的摊位跟前停下，看了看一张手绘的学城地图，寻找去总管阁最近的路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The path divided where the statue of King Daeron the First sat astride his tall stone horse, his sword lifted toward Dorne. A seagull was perched on the Young Dragon's head, and two more on the blade. Sam took the left fork, which ran beside the river. At the Weeping Dock, he watched two acolytes help an old man into a boat for the short voyage to the Bloody Isle. A young mother climbed in after him, a babe not much older than Gilly's squalling in her arms. Beneath the dock, some cook's boys waded in the shallows, gathering frogs. A stream of pink-cheeked novices hurried by him toward the septry. I should have come here when I was their age, Sam thought. If I had run off and taken a false name, I could have disappeared amongst the other novices. Father could have pretended that Dickon was his only son. I doubt he would even have troubled to search for me, unless I took a mule to ride. Then he would have hunted me down, but only for the mule.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道路在戴伦一世的雕像前分叉，国王坐在高大的石马上，剑指多恩。此刻，一只海鸥停在少龙主头上，还有两只停在剑上。山姆走向左面，沿河边前进。在哭泣码头，他看着两名助理学士帮一个老人登上小船，准备去附近的血岛。一位年轻母亲跟在老人后面爬进去，怀中抱着哇哇啼哭的婴儿，跟吉莉的孩子差不多大。码头下面，几个帮厨小弟在浅滩中涉水捕捞青蛙。一群脸色粉嫩的小学徒从他身边匆匆跑过，向圣堂而去。我在他们这个年纪时，就该来这里，山姆心想，假如当时我偷偷逃走，换个假名字，也许可以消失在其他学徒之中。父亲会假装狄肯是他唯一的儿子，我怀疑他甚至不愿费神来找我，除非我骑骡子离开——他会追捕我，仅仅是为了骡子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beyond the doors he found a hall with a stone floor and high, arched windows. At the far end a man with a pinched face sat upon a raised dais, scratching in a ledger with a quill. Though the man was clad in a maester's robe, there was no chain about his neck. Sam cleared his throat. "Good morrow." The man glanced up and did not appear to approve of what he saw. "You smell of novice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门内是个大厅，石地板，高拱窗。大厅尽头有个脸瘦瘦的人坐在高台上，正用羽毛笔往一本册子上写字。此人虽身穿学士长袍，脖子上却没颈链。山姆清清嗓子，“早安。”那人抬头观看，对所见到的似乎并不满意，“你有学徒的味道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The gatekeeper did not so much as glance at Sam in all that time. The fog outside grew thinner as the day wore on, and pale sunlight slanted down through the windows. He found himself watching dust motes dance in the light. A yawn escaped him, then another. He picked at a broken blister on his palm, then leaned his head back and closed his eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam chewed on the question for a moment, wondering how much he ought to say. The sphinx is the riddle, not the riddler. Could Maester Aemon have meant this Sphinx? It seemed unlikely. "Lord Commander Snow sent him away to save his life," he began, hesitantly. He spoke awkwardly of King Stannis and Melisandre of Asshai, intending to stop at that, but one thing led to another and he found himself speaking of Mance Rayder and his wildlings, king's blood and dragons, and before he knew what was happening, all the rest came spilling out; the wights at the Fist of First Men, the Other on his dead horse, the murder of the Old Bear at Craster's Keep, Gilly and their flight, Whitetree and Small Paul, Coldhands and the ravens, Jon's becoming lord commander, the Blackbird, Dareon, Braavos, the dragons Xhondo saw in Qarth, the Cinnamon Wind and all that Maester Aemon whispered toward the end. He held back only the secrets that he was sworn to keep, about Bran Stark and his companions and the babes Jon Snow had swapped. "Daenerys is the only hope," he concluded. "Aemon said the Citadel must send her a maester at once, to bring her home to Westeros before it is too late."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对这个问题山姆考虑了一会儿，不知该说多少。斯芬克斯即是谜题，并非出谜题者。伊蒙师傅是指这位斯芬克斯吗？似乎不太可能。“雪诺总司令为救他性命才把他送走。”他犹豫不决地开讲。他笨嘴拙舌地说起史坦尼斯国王和亚夏的梅丽珊卓，本想就此打住，但一件事牵扯出另一件，他不由自主又讲到曼斯·雷德和野人们，讲到龙和国王之血，随后所有事情全涌了出来；先民拳峰上的尸鬼，骑死马的异鬼，熊老在卡斯特堡垒被杀害，吉莉和他逃出来，白树村和小保罗，冷手与乌鸦，琼恩成为总司令，黑鸟号，戴利恩，布拉佛斯，崇在魁尔斯见到的龙，月桂风号，伊蒙师傅临终前的喃喃低语。他只留出那些自己发誓保守的秘密，关于布兰·史塔克和他的伙伴们，还有琼恩调换的婴儿。“丹妮莉丝是唯一的希望，”他总结道，“伊蒙说学城必须立即派给她一名学士，将她及时带回家乡维斯特洛。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Half of the branches seemed dead, but elsewhere a few red leaves still rustled, and it was there the ravens liked to perch. The tree was full of them, and there were more in the arched windows overhead, all around the yard. The ground was speckled by their droppings. As they crossed the yard, one flapped overhead and he heard the others quorking to each other. "Archmaester Walgrave has his chambers in the west tower, below the white rookery," Alleras told him.

His head was too big for his body, and the way it thrust forward from his shoulders, together with that slab of jaw, made him look as if he were about to tear off someone's head. Though short and squat, he was heavy in the chest and shoulders, with a round, rock-hard ale belly straining at the laces of the leather jerkin he wore in place of robes. Bristly white hair sprouted from his ears and nostrils. His brow beetled, his nose had been broken more than once, and sourleaf had stained his teeth a mottled red. He had the biggest hands that Sam had ever seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马尔温公牛般的脖子上戴着一条由无数金属串成的链子，除此之外，他看上去更像码头恶棍，而不像学士。他的脑袋相对身体来说太大，从双肩之间突出来向前探出的模样外加石板般的下巴，让他看起来好像正准备拧下别人的脑袋。尽管他生得矮胖，胸脯和肩膀却非常厚实。他不穿长袍，皮革上衣的带子被坚硬如石的浑圆酒肚子绷得紧紧的。挺立的白毛从他耳朵和鼻孔里钻出来。他额头突出，鼻梁断过不止一次，牙齿被酸草叶染成斑驳的红色。他有一双山姆毕生所见最大的手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Sam hesitated, one of those hands grabbed him by the arm and yanked him through the door. The room beyond was large and round. Books and scrolls were everywhere, strewn across the tables and stacked up on the floor in piles four feet high. Faded tapestries and ragged maps covered the stone walls. A fire was burning in the hearth, beneath a copper kettle. Whatever was inside of it smelled burned. Aside from that, the only light came from a tall black candle in the center of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆还在犹豫，那双大手中的一只便抓住他胳膊，将他拉进门。里面是个圆形的大屋子，到处是书和卷轴，有些铺在桌面上，有些一摞一摞在地板上堆至四尺高。褪色的织锦和破破烂烂的地图挂满了石墙。炉膛烧着火，上面有只铜水壶，不知在煮什么，但有股烧焦的味道。除此之外，唯一的光亮来自房间中央一支高高的黑蜡烛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The candle was unpleasantly bright. There was something queer about it. The flame did not flicker, even when Archmaester Marwyn closed the door so hard that papers blew off a nearby table. The light did something strange to colors too. Whites were bright as fresh-fallen snow, yellow shone like gold, reds turned to flame, but the shadows were so black they looked like holes in the world. Sam found himself staring. The candle itself was three feet tall and slender as a sword, ridged and twisted, glittering black. "Is that…?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那支蜡烛亮得让人不适，令人不安。马尔温博士用力关上门，把旁边桌上的纸都震了下去，蜡烛的火焰却没闪烁。火焰的颜色很古怪，白如新雪，黄如熔金，红似烈焰，但它留下的影子如此漆黑，仿佛世界的黑洞。山姆发现自己在盯着它看，蜡烛足有三尺高，细瘦似剑，螺旋状边沿锋利如刀，微微闪烁着黑光。“这是…？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那火焰没有燃料？”山姆惊奇地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What feeds a dragon's fire?" Marwyn seated himself upon a stool. "All Valyrian sorcery was rooted in blood or fire. The sorcerers of the Freehold could see across mountains, seas, and deserts with one of these glass candles. They could enter a man's dreams and give him visions, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before their candles. Do you think that might be useful, Slayer?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“龙焰靠什么燃料？”马尔温坐到一张凳子上。“瓦雷利亚巫术基于血与火。利用这种玻璃蜡烛，古自由堡垒的巫师的视线可以穿越高山、海洋和沙漠；坐在这种蜡烛跟前，他们能进入别人梦中展示幻像，或隔着半个世界互通信息。你觉得这有用吗，杀手？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Did he?" Archmaester Marwyn shrugged. "Perhaps it's good that he died before he got to Oldtown. Elsewise the grey sheep might have had to kill him, and that would have made the poor old dears wring their wrinkled hands."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“杀他？”山姆震惊地问，“为什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I tell you, they may need to kill you too." Marywn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between his teeth. "Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?" He spat. "The world the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights he should have been raised to archmaester. His blood was why. He could not be trusted. No more than I can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“若我将真相告诉你，他们或许只能把你也杀了。”马尔温惨笑一声，齿间带有酸草叶的红色汁液。“你以为龙是怎么绝种的？拿铁剑的屠龙勇士干的？”他啐了一口。“学城企图构建的世界中没有巫术、预言和玻璃蜡烛的位置，更不用说龙了。你扪心自问，伊蒙·坦格利安早该晋升为博士，为何在长城浪费余生。因为血统。血统导致他不被信任。跟我一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star. I know the prophecy." Marwyn turned his head and spat a gob of red phlegm onto the floor. "Not that I would trust it. Gorghan of Old Ghis once wrote that a prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how fine, how good this is… and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams. That is the nature of prophecy, said Gorghan. Prophecy will bite your prick off every time." He chewed a bit. "Still…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“诞生于盐与烟之地，伴随着泣血之星。我知道预言。”马尔温扭头，吐了一口红色的黏液到地上。“不过我不信它。古吉斯帝国的高艮曾写道，预言犹如狡诈的女人。她会把你那玩意儿含在嘴里，让你愉悦地呻吟，脑子里想着，这是多么甜蜜，多么美妙，多么舒服…然后她骤然阖上牙齿，你的呻吟变成了尖叫。高艮认为这就是预言的本质，预言每次都会咬掉你的老二。”他咀嚼了几下。“话虽如此…”">查看中文翻译</div>

Tell them that you have always dreamed that one day you might be allowed to wear the chain and serve the greater good, that service is the highest honor, and obedience the highest virtue.

The grey sheep will send their man on a galley, I don't doubt. With fair winds I should reach her first." Marwyn glanced at Sam again, and frowned. "You… you should stay and forge your chain. If I were you, I would do it quickly. A time will come when you'll be needed on the Wall." He turned to the pasty-faced novice. "Find Slayer a dry cell.
