<div class="line_en">Edward started backing up immediately, pulling my arm and Emmett's. We hurried backward, keeping our eyes on the advancing threat. Jacob retreated slowest, the fur on his shoulders standing straight up as he bared his fangs at Aro. Renesmee grabbed the end of his tail as we retreated; she held it like a leash, forcing him to stay with us. We reached our family at the same time that the dark cloaks surrounded Aro again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How can you abide this infamy? Why do we stand here impotently in the face of such an outrageous crime, covered by such a ridiculous deception?" He held his arms rigidly at his sides, his hands curled into claws. I wondered why he did not just touch Aro to share his opinion. Were we seeing a division in their ranks already? Could we be that lucky?</div>

<div class="line_en">I glanced at the angry mob, too, and saw immediately that the description no longer applied. The frenzy for action had turned to confusion. Whispered conversations seethed through the crowd as they tried to make sense of what had happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也注视着那群躁动的乌合之众，发现这形容似乎已经不再适用了，他们之前那种跃跃欲试的急躁变成了困惑，为了弄清究竟发生了什么事，人群中翻涌着低声的交谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because it's all true," Aro told him calmly. "Every word of it. See how many witnesses stand ready to give evidence that they have seen this miraculous child grow and mature in just the short time they've known her. That they have felt the warmth of the blood that pulses in her veins." Aro's gesture swept from Amun on one side across to Siobhan on the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为那全都是事实，”阿罗平静的告诉他，“每一个字都是真的，看看多少目击者都准备好要证实在他们认识这孩子后的短时间内，她不可思议的成长与成熟，他们感受过她血管内温热血液的跳动。”阿罗用手指点着，从阿蒙这边一直扫到另一侧的西博汉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caius reacted oddly to Aro's soothing words, starting ever so slightly at the mention of witnesses. The anger drained from his features, replaced by a cold calculation. He glanced at the Volturi witnesses with an expression that looked vaguely… nervous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从阿罗非常轻柔的提起“目击者”开始，卡尤斯对他平静的话语做出了奇怪的反应。阿罗的手势使他的愤怒荡然无存，代之以一种冷酷的思索。他凝视着沃尔图里这边的目击者，表情中有一丝若有若无的……紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caius was frowning, deep in thought. His speculative expression stoked the flames of my smoldering anger at the same time that it worried me. What if the guard acted again on some invisible signal, as they had in their march? Anxiously, I inspected my shield; it felt just as impenetrable as before. I flexed it now into a low, wide dome that arced over our company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡尤斯在皱额沉思。他那揣测的神情煽动了我内心郁积的怒火，同时也让我担忧起来：要是沃尔图里士兵门像行军时那样毫无征兆的就行动起来怎么办？我焦虑的检查了一下我的保护盾，感觉它仍像之前一样牢不可催。现在我把它收紧成为一个低而宽阔的弧形，包围着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fascinated, I tugged in more threads of the fabric, pulling it around each glimmering shape that was a friend or ally. The shield clung to them willingly, moving as they moved.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这些仅用了一秒钟。卡尤斯仍在深思熟虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could feel the sharp plumes of light where my family and friends stood -- each one an individual flavor that I thought I would be able to recognize with practice. I already knew Edward's -- his was the very brightest of them all. The extra empty space around the shining spots bothered me; there was no physical barrier to the shield, and if any of the talented Volturi got under it, it would protect no one but me. I felt my forehead crease as I pulled the elastic armor very carefully closer. Carlisle was the farthest forward; I sucked the shield back inch by inch, trying to wrap it as exactly to his body as I could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能感觉到亲朋好友们所站之处发出一缕缕耀眼的光芒——如果加以练习的话，我应该可以辨认出他们各自不同的特点，我已经了解了爱德华那最为明亮的光芒。那些笼罩着他们的光斑周围的空间难住了我，在这些地方，保护盾内并没有任何实体，如果沃尔图里家族某些狠角色转进了这些空子，进入我的保护盾内，那其他人就全遭殃了。我认真的将这弹性盾甲拉近，感觉额头都皱了起来。卡莱尔是最远的一个，我一寸一寸的小心收紧保护盾，尽量使它按卡莱尔的身形包裹着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My shield seemed to want to cooperate. It hugged his shape; when Carlisle shifted to the side to stand nearer to Tanya, the elastic stretched with him, drawn to his spark.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Will you defend that alliance, too, Aro?" Caius demanded. "The Children of the Moon have been our bitter enemies from the dawn of time. We have hunted them to near extinction in Europe and Asia. Yet Carlisle encourages a familiar relationship with this enormous infestation -- no doubt in an attempt to overthrow us. The better to protect his warped lifestyle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也要为对面的联盟辩护吗，阿罗？”卡尤斯询问道，“月光之子（The Children of the Moon，指狼人）历来就是我们的仇敌，我们已经在欧亚把他们几乎赶尽杀绝，然而卡莱尔居然鼓励与这群穷凶极恶的畜生建立亲近的关系——毫无疑问，他是想推翻我们，以便更好的保护他那畸形的生活方式。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The werewolves," he murmured at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“狼人，”他终于嘟囔出一句话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With sudden panic, I realized that most of the werewolves were unprotected. I was about to reach out to them when I realize that, strangely, I could still feel their sparks. Curious, I drew the shield tighter in, until Amun and Kebi -- the farthest edge of our group -- were outside with the wolves. Once they were on the other side, their lights vanished. They no longer existed to that new sense. But the wolves were still bright flames -- or rather, half of them were. Hmm… I edged outward again, and as soon as Sam was under cover, all the wolves were brilliant sparks again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我突然惊恐的发现大部分狼人都不在我的保护之下。我正要把他们也拉入盾甲，突然惊奇的发现自己仍能感受到他们的光芒。我好奇的再次把保护盾收紧，直到队伍最远边界处的阿蒙和凯比也和狼人一起处于保护盾之外，他们的光芒一离开盾甲就消失了，不再有那种新奇的光圈。但狼人们仍闪烁着明亮的光焰——至少半数如此，嗯……我又把保护盾向外扩张开，山姆一进入覆盖区，所有的狼人就又一次笼罩在灿烂的光芒中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward cleared his throat loudly and Caius glared at him. Aro placed one thin, delicate hand over his own face as if he was embarrassed for the other ancient.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华大声的清了清喉咙。卡尤斯怒视着他，阿罗用一只纤长的手捂住自己的脸，仿佛为卡尤斯的话羞愧不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Caius, it's the middle of the day," Edward pointed out. He gestured to Jacob. "These are not Children of the Moon, clearly. They bear no relation to your enemies on the other side of the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“卡尤斯，现在是中午，”爱德华强调，他指着雅各布：“很明显，这才不是什么‘月光之子’，他们与你那远在世界另一边的敌人毫无瓜葛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward's jaw clenched and unclenched, then he answered evenly, "They aren't even werewolves. Aro can tell you all about it if you don't believe me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华咬了咬牙，然后平静的回答：“他们甚至不是狼人，如果你不相信我的话，阿罗可以为你解释一切。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You breed mutants here," Caius spit back at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你生了一个异形在这儿。”卡尤斯明显是恼羞成怒，反咬一口。（卡尤斯找死啊！！！！（╰_╯）#）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not werewolves? I shot a mystified look at Jacob. He lifted his huge shoulders and let them drop -- a shrug. He didn't know what Edward was talking about, either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不是狼人？我疑惑的看了雅各布一眼，他巨大的肩膀抬了抬又放下——一个耸肩，他也不明白爱德华的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dear Caius, I would have warned you not to press this point if you had told me your thoughts," Aro murmured. "Though the creatures think of themselves as werewolves, they are not. The more accurate name for them would be shape-shifters. The choice of a wolf form was purely chance. It could have been a bear or a hawk or a panther when the first change was made. These creatures truly have nothing to do with the Children of the Moon. They have merely inherited this skill from their fathers. It's genetic -- they do not continue their species by infecting others the way true werewolves do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的卡尤斯，如果你早告诉我你的想法，我就会警告你避免进入这种窘迫的僵局。”阿罗嘟囔着，“尽管这些家伙以为自己是狼人，但实际上他们并不是。更准确的说，他们应该叫‘变形人’（shape—shifter），选择变成狼形纯粹是个偶然。第一次变形可以成为熊，鹰或者豹，这群家伙确实与月光之子无关，他们纯粹从父辈那里继承了这种本领，这是遗传的——与真正的狼人通过咬人感染来持续物种的方式是不同的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但他们知道我们的秘密了。”他直截了当的说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought I understood the instruction behind Aro's careful wording. False charges weren't helping convince the watching witnesses on either side; Aro was cautioning Caius to move on to the next strategy. I wondered if the reason behind the apparent strain between the two ancients -- Caius's unwillingness to share his thoughts with a touch -- was that Caius didn't care about the show as much as Aro did. If the coming slaughter was so much more essential to Caius than an untarnished reputation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想我明白阿罗谨慎的措辞背后隐藏的指示，虚假的指控对拉拢和说服双方正在持观望态度的目击者没有帮助。阿罗正在告诫卡尤斯进入下一计划，我怀疑这两个长老间之所以有着如此显而易见的分歧——卡尤斯不愿意触碰阿罗分享自己的想法——是因为卡尤斯不像阿罗那样在意面子上那些冠冕堂皇的假象，前提是对卡尤斯来说，即将来临的杀戮远比保持一个好名声更重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward looked about to answer this accusation, but Aro spoke faster. "They are creatures of our supernatural world, brother. Perhaps even more dependent upon secrecy than we are; they can hardly expose us. Carefully, Caius. Specious allegations get us nowhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华似乎对这个指责早有准备，但阿罗抢着接过了话头：“他们是我们超自然世界里的一部分，兄弟，也许比我们还需要保守秘密，他们几乎不可能曝光我们。谨慎点，卡尤斯，似是而非的断言对我们没好处。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caius stood alone beside the blazing remains of Irina, the metal object in his hand still throwing a thick jet of flame into the pyre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡尤斯独自站在伊琳娜正在燃烧的残尸旁，手里的金属物件仍在向她葬身的火堆中喷射着一股浓密的火焰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His eyes flashed to our front line, touching swiftly on Tanya's and Kate's frozen forms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的目光闪向我们前排，迅速的落在坦尼娅和凯特僵直的身体上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a small clicking sound, the fire shooting from Caius's hand disappeared. A gasp rippled through the mass of witnesses behind the Volturi.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们惊恐万分以至于鸦雀无声，知道死亡会以锐不可当的疾速来临是一回事，而真正见识到它的发生却又是另一回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the ploy. He had not wanted Irina's complaint; he had wanted her defiance. His excuse to destroy her, to ignite the violence that filled the air like a thick, combustible mist. He had thrown a match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一个花招，他根本没想要伊琳娜申诉，只是想要她的反抗，以便找到一个干掉她的借口，并向这种一触即发的烧灼的浓雾中扔了一根火柴，引燃了那弥漫在空气中的暴力与血腥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The strained peace of this summit already teetered more precariously than an elephant on a tightrope. Once the fight began, there would be no way to stop it. It would only escalate until one side was entirely extinct. Our side. Caius knew this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种压抑的平静比钢丝上的大象更摇摇欲坠，一旦战争爆发，就不可阻止，甚至要持续扩大到某一方全军覆没。（全军覆没的）会是我们，卡尤斯知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“阻止她们！”爱德华大喊，一边跳过去抓住坦尼娅的胳膊——她正带着一种歇斯底里的盛怒哭嚎着发疯一般扑向正在微笑的卡尤斯。她挣脱不开爱德华，直到卡莱尔也紧紧用双臂锁住她的手腕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett flung himself at her, knocking her to the ground again. He bound his arms around hers, locking his hands around his own wrists. I saw his body spasm as she shocked him. His eyes rolled back in his head, but his hold did not break.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加勒特也扑向她，又一次把她摁倒在地，将两人的胳膊牢牢绞在一起，并用双手锁紧自己的手腕。我看见他的身体由于凯特的拼命挣扎而颤抖着，瞳孔几乎缩回了脑仁儿里，但是仍没有松开凯特。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kate was harder to contain. Shrieking wordlessly like Tanya, she broke into the first stride of the attack that would end with everyone's death. Rosalie was closest to her, but before Rose could clinch her in a headlock, Kate shocked her so violently that Rose crumpled to the ground. Emmett caught Kate's arm and threw her down, then staggered back, his knees giving out. Kate rolled to her feet, and it looked like no one could stop her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯特更是难以控制自己，她像坦尼娅一样失去理智般的尖叫着，持续这种盲目的攻击会把我们都送上死路。罗莎莉离她最近，但罗莎还没来得及夹头抱紧她，她就粗暴的挣脱开了，罗莎跌倒在地。埃美特冲上去抓住凯特的胳膊把她撂倒，然后跌跌撞撞地向回拖她，但是他膝盖一软，凯特又连滚带爬的挣扎着站起来，看上去好像谁也阻止不了她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“听我说，坦尼娅，凯特，”卡莱尔低沉而紧张的说，“复仇现在救不了她了，伊琳娜不想让你们这样送死，想想你们在干嘛——如果你们攻击了他们，我们所有人都死定了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The heaviest glare came from Caius, staring with enraged disbelief at Kate and Garrett in the snow. Aro was watching the same two, incredulity the strongest emotion on his face. He knew what Kate could do. He had felt her potency through Edward's memories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来自卡尤斯的目光最为沉重，他对雪地里纠缠的凯特和加勒特怒目而视，带着一种难以置信的神情。阿罗也在以一种有史以来他个人最强烈的怀疑表情注视着他们，他知道凯特的本事，他从爱德华的记忆中了解了她的天赋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Did he understand what was happening now -- did he see that my shield had grown in strength and subtlety far beyond what Edward knew me to be capable of? Or did he think Garrett had learned his own form of immunity?</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind them, forty-three witnesses watched with very different expressions than the ones they'd worn entering the clearing. Confusion had turned to suspicion. The lightning-fast destruction of Irina had shaken them all. What had been her crime?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们后面，43个目击证人带着与进入空地时截然不同的表情，困惑变成了疑虑。伊琳娜闪电一般的毁灭动摇了他们所有人，她何罪之有呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Without the immediate attack that Caius had counted on to distract from his rash act, the Volturi witnesses were left questioning exactly what was going on here. Aro glanced back swiftly while I watched, his face betraying him with one flash of vexation. His need for an audience had backfired badly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要不是因为卡尤斯指望通过快点除掉伊琳娜的方式来转移大家对他鲁莽行事的注意力，沃尔图里的目击证人们就会一直对事情的究竟蒙在鼓里。我偶然看到阿罗的一瞥，他的表情暴露出一闪而过的恼火——他想要观众，但现在严重地事与愿违。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caius straightened, and his expression hardened into unreadability. He stared forward, seeing nothing. His face reminded me, oddly, of a person who'd just learned he'd been demoted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡尤斯站直了身体，表情又变得冷酷无情，他眼神空洞地盯着前方，这表情是我莫名地觉得他像是刚刚得知自己被降了级。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aro was obviously concerned with keeping his white hat, as the Romanians had put it. But I didn't believe that the Volturi would leave us in peace just to save their reputation. After they finished with us, surely they would slaughter their witnesses for that purpose. I felt a strange, sudden pity for the mass of the strangers the Volturi had brought to watch us die. Demetri would hunt them until they were extinct, too.</div>
