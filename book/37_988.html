<div class="line_en">"My father says there's no such thing as witches," said Wensleydale, who had fair, wavy hair, and peered seriously out at life through thick black-rimmed spectacles. It was widely believed that he had once been christened Jeremy, but no one ever used the name, not even his parents, who called him Youngster. They did this in the subconscious hope that he might take the hint; Wensleydale gave the impression of having been born with a mental age of forty-seven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我父亲说世上没有什么女巫。”温斯利戴[1]说。他有一头金色卷发，还有总从黑边厚眼镜后面认真窥视世间万象的眼睛。很多人都相信他受洗时曾被命名为杰里米，但谁都没用过这个名字称呼他，就连他父母也一样——他们叫他小家伙。他们之所以这样做，是因为潜意识中希望他能领会此中暗示。温斯利戴总给人一种刚出生心理年龄就有四十七岁的感觉。【注：[1]温斯利的大名。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's moved into Jasmine Cottage and she's a witch," she said. "I know, because Mrs. Henderson does the cleaning and she told my mother she gets a witches' newspaper. She gets loads of ordinary newspapers, too, but she gets this special witches' one."</div>

There's no witches any more, actually. People invented medicines and that and told 'em they didn't need 'em any more and started burning 'em."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那不是给女巫看的。”温斯利戴说，“我婶婶就有。那上面的文章都是意念弯勺、占卜算命和认为自己上辈子是伊丽莎白女王的人。实际上，世上早就没有女巫了。人们发明了医药，然后对她们说‘你们没用了’，接着就把她们全烧死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Brian snorted. If it had been Wensley who had said that, there'd have been a half-hearted scuffle, as between friends. But the other Them had long ago learned that Pepper did not consider herself bound by the informal conventions of brotherly scuffles. She could kick and bite with astonishing physiological accuracy for a girl of eleven. Besides, at eleven years old the Them were beginning to be bothered by the dim conception that laying hands on good ole Pep moved things into blood-thumping categories they weren't entirely at home with yet, besides earning you a snake-fast blow that would have floored the Karate Kid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布赖恩哼了一声。如果这话出自温斯利戴之口，接下来很可能发生一场朋友间半真半假的打闹。但“他们”的男性成员早就明白，佩帕从不认为自己应该遵守朋友间打闹的不成文规定。她会以十一岁女孩惊人的准确度又踢又咬。另外，十一岁的“他们”已经隐隐觉得把手放在老伙计佩帕身上，会让人进入心跳加速的状态，并因此感到困扰。当然，这样做也少不了惹来一记足以击倒功夫小子的蛇拳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, shut up," said Pepper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，闭嘴。”佩帕说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she was good to have in your gang. They remembered with pride the time when Greasy Johnson and his gang had taunted them for playing with a girl. Pepper had erupted with a fury that had caused Greasy's mother to come round that evening and complain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她在你这派里总是好的。他们都骄傲地记得，有一次戈里希·约翰逊和他的帮派——小镇中仅有的另一派——嘲笑他们跟女孩玩，佩帕突然爆发，最终闹到戈里希的妈妈夜里找上门来抱怨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">[Greasy Johnson was a sad and oversized child. There's one in every school; not exactly fat, but simply huge and wearing almost the same size clothes as his father. Paper tore under his tremendous fingers, pens shattered in his grip. Children whom he tried to play with in quiet, friendly games ended up getting under his huge feet, and Greasy Johnson had become a bully almost in self-defense. After all, it was better to be called a bully, which at least implied some sort of control and desire, than to be called a big clumsy oaf. He was the despair of the sports master, because if Greasy Johnson had taken the slightest interest in sport, then the school could have been champions. But Greasy Johnson had never found a sport that suited him. He was instead secretly devoted to his collection of tropical fish, which won him prizes. Greasy Johnson was the same age as Adam Young, to within a few hours, and his parents had never told him he was adopted. See? You were right about the babies.]</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（戈里希·约翰逊是个可怜的大块头。每所学校都有这么个孩子。其实不能算胖，只是又大又壮，穿的衣服几乎跟他爸爸尺码相同。纸张在他粗壮的手指间粉碎，铅笔在他掌中断裂。他试着跟别人玩些安静友好的游戏，但最终别人会被踩在他的大脚下。戈里希·约翰逊几乎是出于自卫地成了个小霸王。小霸王这个称呼总比大笨瓜好，至少它表明了支配力和一点期许。戈里希让体育老师们绝望，因为只要他对体育有一点点兴趣，就能为学校赢得冠军荣誉。但戈里希从没找到适合自己的运动。私下里，他热衷于收集热带鱼，还因此获过奖。戈里希·约翰逊跟亚当·扬年纪相同，前后就差几小时，而且他父母从没说过他是收养来的。明白了吗？婴儿们的经历，你猜得一点没错。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pepper's given first names were Pippin Galadriel Moonchild. She had been given them in a naming ceremony in a muddy valley field that contained three sick sheep and a number of leaky polythene teepees. Her mother had chosen the Welsh valley of Pant-y-Gyrdl as the ideal site to Return to Nature. (Six months later, sick of the rain, the mosquitoes, the men, the tent-trampling sheep who ate first the whole commune's marijuana crop and then its antique minibus, and by now beginning to glimpse why almost the entire drive of human history has been an attempt to get as far away from Nature as possible, Pepper's mother returned to Pepper's surprised grandparents in Tadfield, bought a bra, and enrolled in a sociology course with a deep sigh of relief.)</div>

On any scale of mountain moving it shifted at least point five of an alp. [It may be worth noting here that most human beings can rarely raise more than.3 of an alp (30 centi-alps). Adam believed things on a scale ranging from 2 through to 15,640 Everests.]</div>
