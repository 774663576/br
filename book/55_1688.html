<div class="line_en">The debunking of superstition and dogma removes one of the pretexts for torture, but leaves it available as a punishment for secular crimes and misdemeanors. People in ancient, medieval, and early modern times thought cruel punishments were perfectly reasonable. The whole point of punishing someone is to make him so unhappy that he and others won't be tempted to engage in the prohibited activity. By that reasoning, the harsher the punishment is, the better it accomplishes what it is designed to do. Also, a state without an effective police and judiciary had to make a little punishment go a long way. It had to make the punishments so memorably brutal that anyone who witnessed them would be terrorized into submission and would spread the word to terrorize others.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the practical function of cruel punishments was just a part of their appeal. Spectators enjoyed cruelty, even when it served no judicial purpose. Torturing animals, for example, was good clean fun. In 16th-century Paris, a popular form of entertainment was cat-burning, in which a cat was hoisted in a sling on a stage and slowly lowered into a fire. According to the historian Norman Davies, "The spectators, including kings and queens, shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized." Also popular were dogfights, bull runs, cockfights, public executions of "criminal" animals, and bearbaiting, in which a bear would be chained to a post and dogs would tear it apart or be killed in the effort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，残忍惩罚的实用性只是人们欢迎它的一个方面。甚至在惩罚与法制毫不相关的时候，还有旁观者在欣赏残忍。比如，折磨动物，曾经是人们无伤大雅的娱乐。在16世纪的巴黎，一大流行娱乐是烧猫。人们将猫用绳子吊在舞台上，慢慢放低，一直放入火中。据历史学家诺曼·戴维斯（Norman Davies）说：“观众们，包括国王们和王后们，一起尖声狂笑，看着动物在痛苦中号叫、烧着、烤熟，最后变成焦炭。”其他流行娱乐还有斗狗、奔牛、斗鸡，对“有罪”的动物公开行刑，以及纵狗斗熊游戏。在狗熊游戏中，熊被铁链拴在木桩上，狗或者将熊撕成碎片，或者在搏斗中被熊杀死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of them being of short stature could not reach the hole made for the admission of the head. The officers of justice nevertheless forced his head through the hole and the poor wretch hung rather than stood. He soon grew black in the face and blood issued from his nostrils, his eyes and his ears. The mob nevertheless attacked him with great fury. The officers opened the pillory and the poor wretch fell down dead on the stand of the instrument. The other man was so maimed and hurt by what was thrown at him that he lay there without hope of recovery.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another kind of "corporal punishment" was flogging, the common penalty for insolence or dawdling by British sailors and African American slaves. Whips were engineered in countless models that could flay skin, pulverize flesh into mincemeat, or slice through muscle to the bone. Charles Napier recounted that in the late-18th-century British armed forces, sentences of a thousand lashes were not uncommon:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外一种“体罚”是鞭笞，一种在英国水兵和美国黑奴中常见的刑罚，用于惩罚傲慢或者行动迟缓。鞭子有数不清的型号和种类：有些剥去皮肤；有些将皮肉刮碎，打成肉酱；有些穿透肌肉抽到骨头。根据查尔斯·内皮尔（Charles Napier）的回忆，在18世纪后期的英军中，1000鞭子的处罚绝非罕见：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have often seen victims brought out of the hospital three or four times to receive the remainder of the punishment, too severe to be borne without danger of death at one flogging. It was terrible to see the new, tender skin of the scarcely healed back laid bare again to receive the lash. I have seen hundreds of men flogged and have always observed that when the skin is thoroughly cut up or flayed off, the great pain subsides. Men are frequently convulsed and screaming during the time they receive from one lash to three hundred and then they bear the remainder, even to 800 or a thousand without a groan. They will often lie as without life and the drummers appear to be flogging a lump of dead, raw flesh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我经常看见受罚者被带出医院三四次，接受未执行完的鞭刑。如果一次完成全部处罚，伤害过重，可能会有生命危险。看到刚刚愈合的、鲜嫩的新皮肤赤裸着接受鞭笞，那真是可怕。我见过成百上千的人被鞭打，我一贯的观察是，当皮肤被打绽开，或者被抽掉后，剧痛开始减弱。人们一般从受第一鞭开始颤抖和号叫，直到第300鞭，此后就是忍受，甚至到第800或者第1000鞭子，哼都不会哼一声了。他们通常像死人一样倒在那里，行刑人就像是在鞭打一堆生肉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The word keelhaul is sometimes used to refer to a verbal reprimanding. Its literal sense comes from another punishment in the British navy. A sailor was tied to a rope and pulled around the bottom of the ship's hull. If he didn't drown, he would be slashed to ribbons by the encrusted barnacles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爬进船底”（keelhaul）这个词有时候用来指一种口头训斥，而它字面上的意思来自英国海军的一种惩罚。将水兵用绳子拴住，拖在船身的底部。如果这个水手不被淹死，也会被吸附在船底的藤壶剐成碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the end of the 16th century in England and the Netherlands, imprisonment began to replace torture and mutilation as the penalty for minor crimes. It was not much of an improvement. Prisoners had to pay for food, clothing, and straw, and if they or their families couldn't pay they did without. Sometimes they had to pay for "easement of irons," namely being released from spiked iron collars or from bars that pinned their legs to the floor. Vermin, heat and cold, human waste, and scanty and putrid food not only added to the misery but fostered diseases that made prisons de facto death camps. Many prisons were workhouses in which underfed prisoners were forced to rasp wood, break rocks, or climb moving treadwheels for most of their waking hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到16世纪末，英国和荷兰开始用监禁取代酷刑和肉体残害，作为对轻罪的处罚，但情况并没有真正的改善。囚犯必须自己负担食物、衣服和干草。如果他们或他们的家庭负担不起，就得不到食物、衣服和干草。有些时候，他们不得不支付“松铁”费，就是花钱让狱卒打开戴在囚犯腿上的带刺的铁环，或者是松开将他们的双腿固定在地板上的铁棍子。害虫、酷暑、严寒、粪便、粗粝和腐坏的食物，不仅是痛苦，而且滋生疾病，那个时代的监狱实际上就是死亡营。许多监狱都是工厂，食不果腹的囚徒被强迫终日劳作，从事锯原木、砸石头或者踩踏轮车等重体力活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bland phrase broken on the wheel cannot come close to capturing the horror of that form of punishment. According to one chronicler, the victim was transformed into a "huge screaming puppet writhing in rivulets of blood, a puppet with four tentacles, like a sea monster, of raw, slimy and shapeless flesh mixed up with splinters of smashed bones." In 1762 a sixty-four-year-old French Protestant named Jean Calas was accused of killing his son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism; in fact, he had tried to conceal the son's suicide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“轮上粉碎”这个平淡的词组完全表示不出这种刑罚的恐怖。根据记载，受刑人被整治成一个“巨大的会尖叫的布娃娃，在一道道血流中痛苦地扭动抽搐，就像一只大海怪。这个布娃娃有四个触角，每一个触角都是生腥的、黏稠的、无形无状的肉里混合着一堆一堆的碎骨头”。1762年，法国一位名叫让·卡拉斯的64岁的新教徒，被控为阻止自己的儿子改宗天主教而杀害了他。事实上，他只是想掩盖儿子自杀的真相。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The 18th century marked a turning point in the use of institutionalized cruelty in the West. In England reformers and committees criticized the "cruelty, barbarity, and extortion" they found in the country's prisons. Graphic reports of torture-executions began to sear the public's conscience. According to a description of the execution of Catherine Hayes in 1726, "As soon as the flames reached her, she tried to push away the faggots with her hands but scattered them. The executioner got hold of the rope around her neck and tried to strangle her but the fire reached his hand and burned it so he had to let it go. More faggots were immediately thrown on the fire and in three or four hours she was reduced to ashes."</div>

<div class="line_en">During an interrogation that attempted to draw out the names of his accomplices, he was subjected to the strappado and water torture, then was broken on the wheel. After being left in agony for two hours, Calas was finally strangled in an act of mercy. Witnesses who heard his protestations of innocence as his bones were being broken were moved by the terrible spectacle. Each blow of the iron club "sounded in the bottom of their souls," and "torrents of tears were unleashed, too late, from all the eyes present." Voltaire took up the cause, noting the irony that foreigners judged France by its fine literature and beautiful actresses without realizing that it was a cruel nation that followed "atrocious old customs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在审讯中，他被施用了吊坠刑和水刑，目的是要他交代同谋犯，最后他受到轮刑。在经受了两个小时的残忍折磨之后，出于仁慈，他被绞索勒死了。被敲碎骨头时，他还喊着为自己的清白辩护，这幅可怕的图景让围观者深受刺激。铁棒的每一下敲打，“都响在他们的灵魂深处”，而“在场的每一个人都泪流满面，太迟了，已经止不住人们的泪水”。伏尔泰站出来仗义执言，他说，外国人以优雅的文学和美丽的女演员来评判法国，没有注意到法兰西是一个尊奉“残暴旧俗”的冷酷民族。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other prominent writers also began to inveigh against sadistic punishments. Some, like Voltaire, used the language of shaming, calling the practices barbaric, savage, cruel, primitive, cannibalistic, and atrocious. Others, like Montesquieu, pointed out the hypocrisy of Christians' bemoaning their cruel treatment at the hands of Romans, Japanese, and Muslims, yet inflicting the same cruelty themselves. Still others, like the American physician and signer of the Declaration of Independence Benjamin Rush, appealed to the common humanity of readers and the people who were targets of punishment. In 1787 he noted that "the men, or perhaps the women, whose persons we detest, possess souls and bodies composed of the same materials as those of our friends and relations. They are bone of their bone." And, he added, if we consider their misery without emotion or sympathy, then "the principle of sympathy… will cease to act altogether; and will soon lose its place in the human breast." The goal of the judicial system should be to rehabilitate wrongdoers rather than harming them, and "the reformation of a criminal can never be effected by a public punishment." The English lawyer William Eden also noted the brutalizing effect of cruel punishments, writing in 1771, "We leave each other to rot like scare-crows in the hedges; and our gibbets are crowded with human carcasses. May it not be doubted, whether a forced familiarity with such objects can have any other effect, than to blunt the sentiments, and destroy the benevolent prejudices of the people?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他著名作家也开始痛斥虐待性的刑罚。有些人和伏尔泰一样，认为这是法国的耻辱，称这些刑罚是野蛮的、非文明的、残忍的、原始的、食人生番的和令人发指的。其他人，如孟德斯鸠指出，基督徒在为自己受到罗马人、日本人和穆斯林的严酷镇压而悲恸的同时，却使用同样的手法迫害自己的同胞，这实在是很虚伪。一位美国医生，也是美国《独立宣言》的签署人——本杰明·拉什（Benjamin Rush）呼吁说，在读者和那些受过严刑处罚的人之间存在着共同的人性。他在1787年的文章中这样写道：“那些男人，也许还有女人，虽然作为个人，让我们厌恶，但他们也有灵魂，也有用和我们的朋友和亲人一样的物质构成的肉体，一样的物质构成的骨骼。”接着，他说，如果我们对他们的痛苦无动于衷，毫不同情，那么“同情的原则就会彻底失效，并从人类的心里彻底消失”。司法制度的目标应该是改造罪犯，而不是伤害罪犯，“公开的刑罚从来都不是让罪犯洗心革面的有效手段”。英国律师威廉·伊登（William Eden）也关注到残忍刑罚的野蛮功效，他在1771年写道：“我们让自己的同胞像挂在篱笆上的麦草人一样烂掉，我们的绞架上吊满了人类的尸体。用不着怀疑，一个人被迫见惯了这等景象，内心会有什么样的变化，他对人的情感能够不麻木吗，对不幸者的仁慈能够不消失殆尽吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most influential of all was the Milanese economist and social scientist Cesare Beccaria, whose 1764 bestseller On Crimes and Punishments influenced every major political thinker in the literate world, including Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams. 63 Beccaria began from first principles, namely that the goal of a system of justice is to attain "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" (a phrase later adopted by Jeremy Bentham as the motto of utilitarianism). The only legitimate use of punishment, then, is to deter people from inflicting greater harm on others than the harm inflicted on them. It follows that a punishment should be proportional to the harm of the crime -- not to balance some mysterious cosmic scale of justice but to set up the right incentive structure: "If an equal punishment be ordained for two crimes that injure society in different degrees, there is nothing to deter men from committing the greater as often as it is attended with greater advantage." A clearheaded view of criminal justice also entails that the certainty and promptness of a punishment are more important than its severity, that criminal trials should be public and based on evidence, and that the death penalty is unnecessary as a deterrent and not among the powers that should be granted to a state.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这些作家中最有影响的一位是米兰的经济学家和社会学家切萨雷·贝卡里亚，他在1764年出版的畅销书《论犯罪与刑罚》（On Crime and Punishments）在知识分子中产生了巨大的反响，很多大思想家都深受影响，他们包括伏尔泰、狄德罗、杰斐逊和约翰·亚当斯。贝卡里亚的起点是他的第一原则，即司法制度的目的是实现“最大多数人的最大幸福”（这句话后来被边沁引用，成为功利主义的座右铭）。因此，使用刑罚的唯一正当性在于威慑人们不去对其他人造成更大的伤害。推而论之，刑罚应该与犯罪造成的伤害相称，不是要讨还神秘的宇宙正义，而是建立正确的激励机制：“如果两个罪行对社会造成不同程度的伤害，而我们对它们施加同样的处罚，那么，人们就会毫无顾忌地尽可能为了占取更大的便宜而犯下更大的罪行。”贝卡里亚对刑事司法进行了冷静的分析，他明确表示，对威慑犯罪而言，刑事处罚的确定性和及时性远比其严厉性更重要；刑事审判应该公开，并以事实为依据；死刑不是威慑的必要手段，而且不属于应该授予国家掌握的权力。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was placed on the papal Index of Forbidden Books, and vigorously contested by the legal and religious scholar Pierre-François Muyart de Vouglans.

<div class="line_en">I have demarcated the 18th century on this and the other graphs in this chapter to highlight the many humanitarian reforms that were launched in this remarkable slice of history. Another was the prevention of cruelty to animals. In 1789 Jeremy Bentham articulated the rationale for animal rights in a passage that continues to be the watchword of animal protection movements today: "The question is not Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?" Beginning in 1800, the first laws against bearbaiting were introduced into Parliament. In 1822 it passed the Ill-Treatment of Cattle Act and in 1835 extended its protections to bulls, bears, dogs, and cats. Like many humanitarian movements that originated in the Enlightenment, opposition to animal cruelty found a second wind during the Rights Revolutions of the second half of the 20th century, culminating in the banning of the last legal blood sport in Britain, the foxhunt, in 2005.</div>
