<div class="line_en">I watched as you opened the door, got out and let your best friend get out of the car. He was dancing around your feet with joy at the idea of a run in the park with you.</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw you abandon and try to kill your best friend yesterday. I was sitting on my front porch when you pulled up to the tennis courts and parked under the big oak tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨天，我看见你丢弃了你的好朋友，并且还试图杀死它。我看见你把车开到网球场，停在一棵大橡树下，当时我正在前门廊那里坐着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You let him run over to the softball field, then jumped back in your car and sped off. Your best friend looked after you in consternation, then chased you as far and as fast as his little legs would go. You almost wrecked your car pulling out into traffic. The next car turn into the park as he stood there and stared after you almost killed your best friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等它跑到垒球场那里，你就跳进了车里，急速开跑了。你的好朋友在后面惊愕地看着你，然后飞速奔跑着追赶你。你冲进车流里，差点儿毁了自己的车。另一辆车转入了公园，而你的狗狗正站在那儿目瞪口呆，你差点儿杀了你最好的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought you should know that the little dog you abandoned went back to the big oak tree, there he stayed for the rest of the day. When he first went back to the tree, he sat down, threw his head back and howled his grief, anguish and fear to the heavens, then he settled down, and loyal to a fault, waited for you to return. You never did. You never intended to return to the little animal that had given you his heart, his soul and his loyalty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想，你应该想到你丢弃的小狗又回到了那棵大橡树那，一整天都待在那里。一开始回到那棵树时，它坐在那，仰着头，对着天空吼叫着自己的悲伤、痛苦和恐惧。然后它平静了下来，傻傻地等着你回来。但是你再也没有回来。你从来没打算再回到那个把自己的心、自己的灵魂以及忠诚都给了你的小动物身边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Animal Control was called, but never came. Your dog waited there for you through thunderstorms and pouring rain. He never went more than 100 feet from where you left him. Never sought shelter and would not approach anyone, rather he ran from them and made it clear he intended to wait for you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人给动物控制中心的人打了电话，可是一直没有人来。你的小狗在那里风雨无阻地等着你。它从来没有离开过你丢弃它的那个地方，没有去过超过100英尺的范围之外。不去找地方住，也不去接近任何人，而是逃离他们，很明显它是在等着你回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I fed him twice, once before I went to work, once when I returned. He would not come to me. One child was able to pet your best friend. He went home to see if he could keep your dog and was told he could bring him home long enough for Animal Control to come get him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喂过它两次，一次在我上班之前，一次在我下班的时候。它不愿意接近我。一个孩子抚摩了你的好朋友。他回去看看能不能收留你的狗，直到动物控制中心的人来把它带走，才被告知他可以把狗狗带回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't satisfied with that answer, so, I took your best friend in. I have seen abused animals before, but he was terrified. He cringe at any sudden movement or loud voice. His expressive eyes told the whole story -- desperately afraid, yet so very hopeful that maybe, just maybe, this time he wouldn't get hurt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于那个答案，我很不满意，所以，我把你的好朋友带回了家。我以前看见过被虐待的动物，但是它很害怕。一有任何动静或大的声音，它就立刻蜷缩起来。它的眼神给我们讲述了这整个故事——绝望的恐惧，但是它仍然希望，也许，仅仅是也许，这一次它不会再受到伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stayed home from work today. Your former best friend and I took a trip to my vet. He was so scared, his little heart pounding. Afraid he was going to be abandoned again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我今天没去上班。我和你以前的好友一起去了我的兽医诊所。它很害怕，小心脏一直在扑腾扑腾地跳。担心它会再次被丢弃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I expected, he was full of parasites, hook, round and pin worms. He has now had all his shots and is scheduled for surgery next week. The day I take him in for surgery, I will license him. I hope he doesn't have heartworms, but if he does, I'll see that he is treated for those as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如我所料，它身上到处都是寄生虫，钩状的，圆的，针形的蠕虫。到现在它打了所有能打的针，并安排下周做手术。从我带它去做手术那天起，我就许可了它。我希望它没有犬心虫，但如果有的话，我也会一同给它治疗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If you should ever see this letter, be warned. If you show your face or vehicle around my home, your license tag number will be noted and I will take a warrant for your arrest for Cruelty to Animals. Should I get the chance to do this, I will push for you to receive the maximum punishment that the law allows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你曾经看到了这封信，请小心一点。如果在我家附近，让我看见了你或者你的车，你的车牌号将会被记下来，我会带着逮捕证去逮捕你，告你虐待动物。如果我有机会来做这些，我会在法律允许的情况下，重重地惩罚你。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Bible says that man was given dominion over the earth and the animals thereupon. If you look up the word dominion, it means stewardship. Stewardship means that man is the caretaker appointed to care for The Master's property until The Master returns. Your brand of "stewardship" is unacceptable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《圣经》上说，人类可以统治地球以及地球上的动物。如果你查查统治这个词，它的意思是管理。管理指的是被安排去照看主人的财产直到主人归来的看门人。你所标榜的“管理”是无法让人接受的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Native Americans have a legend that says that when a person dies, before he or she is admitted into Heaven; they are judged by the animals they knew here on earth. If I were judging you, you would be consigned to the deepest pits of Hell. Knowing the love and loyalty your best friend had for you, I suspect he would forgive you. I wish I could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="印第安人有一个传说，说当一个人死了的时候，他/她能不能进入天堂，是由他们在地球上认识的动物来评判的。如果让我来评判你，你将被打入十八层地狱。想到你的好朋友对你的爱以及忠诚，我觉得它可能会原谅你。希望我也能。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the record: The above letter was the first I ever wrote with regard to animals I have rescued. "Lille Bit" still lives with me. When he first came to live with me, he was so young that he didn't have his permanent canine teeth yet. Within a week, his personality was beginning to develop and the over whelming fear he had shown at first was vanishing, little by little.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="郑重声明：这是我第一次写与我所救助的动物有关的信件。“里尔·比特”还和我住在一起。它刚开始和我住的时候，还很小，都还没有长犬牙。不到一周，它就变得性情开朗起来，最初的恐惧也渐渐烟消云散了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In my younger days, I didn't like having a dog sleeping in my bed. Now, I find the presence of a warm, loving, living creature beside me comforting, often reaching out during the night and giving him a pat or a rub.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我年轻的时候，我不喜欢让狗睡在我的床上。现在，我发现有个温暖可爱的生物在身边，感到很安心，经常夜里伸出手去拍拍它，抚摩抚摩它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His greatest pleasure now, besides running the squirrels out of the back yard, is to sleep at my side. Either at the side of my recliner in the living room: when I doze off, I often awake to find a head or a paw resting on my arm and a pair of very soulful eyes gazing at me as though to say "I'm here, are you OK?" or when I go to bed, actually lying by my side, as close as he can get.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它现在最大的乐趣，除了和后院的松鼠赛跑外，就是睡在我身边，或者睡在客厅我的躺椅旁边。当我打盹的时候，我经常醒来看到它的头或爪子在我的手臂上，一双深情的双眸盯着我看，好像在说：“我在这，你还好吗？”或者我去睡觉的时候，它就紧紧地躺在我身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
