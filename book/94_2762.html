<div class="line_en">It's difficult ending a fairy tale. All tales have to end sometime, of course. Some can't finish soon enough. This one, for example, could feasibly have been rounded off and packed away long ago. The problem is this whole issue of heroes at the ends of fairy tales, and how they are supposed to "live happily to the end of their days." This gets tricky, from a narrative perspective, because the people who reach the end of their days must leave others who have to live out their days without them.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's dark by the time they leave the vet's. They used to make snow-angels outside the house on the night before Elsa's birthday. That was the only night of the year Granny didn't say crappy things about the angels. It was one of Elsa's favorite traditions. She goes with Alf in Taxi. Not so much because she doesn't want to go with Dad, but because Dad told her Alf was furious with himself for being in the garage with Taxi when the whole thing with Sam happened. Angry because he wasn't there to protect Elsa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们离开动物医院的时候，天色已晚。以前外婆总会在爱莎生日的前一夜和她在屋外做雪天使。每年只有这一天，外婆不会说天使们的坏话。这是爱莎最喜欢的传统之一。她乘阿尔夫的出租车离开，并不是不想坐爸爸的车，而是因为爸爸告诉爱莎，阿尔夫非常自责，在山姆出现、发生整件事的时候，他正在车库里取车。他自责没能及时保护爱莎。">查看中文翻译</div>
