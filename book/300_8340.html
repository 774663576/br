<div class="line_en">WALKING in the shadow of a dream, as it were, and perhaps actually under the influence of a species of somnambulism, Mr Dimmesdale reached the spot, where, now so long since, Hester Prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy. The same platform or scaffold, black and weather-stained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years, and foot-worn, too, with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it, remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting-house. The minister went up the steps.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was an obscure night of early May. An unvaried pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon. If the same multitude which had stood as eye-witnesses while Hester Prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth, they would have discerned no face above the platform, nor hardly the outline of a human shape, in the dark grey of the midnight. But the town was all asleep. There was no peril of discovery. The minister might stand there, if it so pleased him, until morning should redden in the east, without other risk than that the dank and chill night-air would creep into his frame, and stiffen his joints with rheumatism, and clog his throat with catarrh and cough; thereby defrauding the expectant audience of to-morrow's prayer and sermon. No eye could see him, save that ever-wakeful one which had seen him in his closet, wielding the bloody scourge. Why, then, had he come hither? Was it but the mockery of penitence? A mockery, indeed, but in which his soul trifled with itself! A mockery at which angels blushed and wept, while fiends rejoiced, with jeering laughter! He had been driven hither by the impulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere, and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that Cowardice which invariably drew him back, with her tremulous gripe, just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure. Poor, miserable man! what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime? Crime is for the iron-nerved, who have their choice either to endure it, or, if it press too hard, to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose, and fling it off at once! This feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither, yet continually did one thing or another, which intertwined, in the same inextricable knot, the agony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是五月初的一个朦胧的夜晚。一望无际的云幕蒙住了从天顶到地乎线的整个夜空。假如当年海丝特．白兰忍辱受罚时站在那里围观的人群能够重新召集起来的话，他们在这昏黑的午夜依然无法分辨台上人的面孔，甚至也难以看清那人的轮廓。不过，整个城镇都在睡梦之中，不会有被人发观的危险。只要牧师愿意，他可以在那儿一直站到东方泛红。除去阴冷的空气会钻进他的肌体，风湿症会弄僵他的关节，粘膜炎和咳嗽会妨碍他的喉咙之外，绝无其它风险可担；果真染上这些症状，也无非是让翌日参加祈祷和布道的听众的殷殷期望落空而已。没有谁的眼睛会看到他，尽是要除掉那一双始终警觉的眼睛——那人已经看到过他在内室中用血淋淋的鞭子捆打自己了。既然如此，他为什么还要到这里来呢？难道只是对仟悔加以嘲弄吗？这确实是一种嘲弄，但是在这种嘲弄之中，他的灵魂却在自嘲！这种嘲弄，天使会为之胀红着脸哭泣，而恶魔则会嬉笑着称庆！他是被那追逐得他无地自容的“自责”的冲动驱赶到这里来的，而这“自责”的胞妹和密友则是“怯懦”。每当“自责”的冲动催促他到达坦白的边缘时，“怯懦”就一定会用颤抖的双手拖他回去。可怜的不幸的人啊！象他这样一个柔弱的人如何承受得起罪恶的重负呢？罪恶是那种神经如钢铁的人干的，他们自己可以选择：要么甘心忍受；要么在受压过甚时便运用自己凶猛的蛮力，振臂一甩，以达目的！这个身体赢弱而精神敏感的人两者都不能做到，却又不停地彷徨于二者之间，时而这，时而那，终将滔天之罪的痛苦与徒劳无益的悔恨纠缠在一起，形成死结。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was not so. The shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater power, to his own startled ears, than it actually possessed. The town did not awake; or, if it did, the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream, or for the noise of witches; whose voices, at that period, were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages, as they rode with Satan through the air. The clergyman, therefore, hearing no symptoms of disturbance, uncovered his eyes and looked about him. At one of the chamber-windows of Governor Bellingham's mansion, which stood at some distance, on the line of another street, he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-cap on his head, and a long white gown enveloping his figure. He looked like a ghost, evoked unseasonably from the grave. The cry had evidently startled him. At another window of the same house, moreover, appeared old Mistress Hibbins, the Governor's sister, also with a lamp, which, even thus far off, revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face. She thrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously upward. Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady had heard Mr. Dimmesdale's outcry, and interpreted it, with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations, as the clamour of the fiends and night-hags, with whom she was well known to make excursions into the forest. Detecting the gleam of Governor Bellingham's lamp, the old lady quickly extinguished her own, and vanished. Possibly, she went up among the clouds. The minister saw nothing further of her motions. The magistrate, after a wary observation of the darkness -- into which, nevertheless, he could see but little farther than he might into a mill-stone -- retired from the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是并没有发生这种情况。，那声尖叫，在他自己受惊的耳朵听起来，要比实际的音响大得多。镇上人并没有惊醒，就算惊醒了，那些睡得昏昏沉沉的人也会误以为这喊叫是梦中的惊悸或是女巫的吵闹——在那个年月，当女巫们随着撒旦飞过天际时，她们的声音时常在居民区或孤独的茅屋上空掠过，被人们听见。因此，牧师没有听见任何骚动的征象，便不再捂着眼，并四下张望。在稍远的另一条街上，在贝灵汉总督宅邸的一个内室的窗口，他看到那位老长官露出头来，手中拿着一盏灯，头上戴着一顶白色睡帽，周身上下裹着一件白色长袍。他那副样子就象是一个从坟墓中不合时宜地钻出来的鬼魂。显然是那叫声惊醒了他。还有，那座房子的另一个窗口，出现了总督的姐姐，，西宾斯老夫人，她手里也拿着一盏灯，尽管距离这么远，仍然能看出她脸上那种乖戾不满的表情。她把头探出窗格，不安地朝天仰望。不消说，这位令人敬畏的老妖婆已经听到了丁梅斯代尔先生的叫喊，并且由于那无数的回声和反响，她还以为是恶魔和夜间飞行的女巫的喧嚣呢，人们都知道，她常同它们一起在林中嬉游。那老夫人一发现贝灵汉总督的灯光，就赶紧一日吹熄了自己的灯，消失不见了。很可能她飞上了云端。牧师再也望不见她‘的踪影了。总督在小心翼翼地向暗中观察一番之后，也缩回了身子，当然，在这般黑夜中他看不了多远，比起要望穿一块磨石相差无几。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the Reverend Mr. Wilson passed beside the scaffold, closely muffling his Geneva cloak about him with one arm, and holding the lantern before his breast with the other, the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking. "A good evening to you, venerable Father Wilson! Come up hither, I pray you, and pass a pleasant hour with me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可敬的威尔逊先生走过刑台时，一手将黑色宽袖长法衣紧紧裹住他的身躯，另一手将灯举到胸前，就在此刻，丁梅斯代尔牧师几乎禁不住要说出口了：“晚上好，可敬的威尔逊神父！我请求你到这里来，陪我过上一小时欢乐的时光吧！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shortly afterwards, the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought. He felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night, and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold. Morning would break, and find him there. The neighbourhood would begin to rouse itself. The earliest riser, coming forth in the dim twilight, would perceive a vaguely defined figure aloft on the place of shame; and, half crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity, would go, knocking from door to door, summoning all the people to behold the ghost -- as he needs must think it -- of some defunct transgressor. A dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another. Then -- the morning light still waxing stronger -- old patriarchs would rise up in great haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronly dames, without pausing to put off their night-gear. The whole tribe of decorous personages, who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry, would start into public view, with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects. Old Governor Bellingham would come grimly forth, with his King James ruff fastened askew; and Mistress Hibbins, with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts, and looking sourer than ever, as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride; and good Father Wilson, too, after spending half the night at a death-bed, and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early, out of his dreams about the glorified saints. Hither, likewise, would come the elders and deacons of Mr Dimmesdale's church, and the young virgins who so idolised their minister, and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms; which now, by-the-bye, in their hurry and confusion, they would scantily have given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs. All people, in a word, would come stumbling over their thresholds, and turning up their amazed and horror-stricken visages around the scaffold. Whom would they discern there, with the red eastern light upon his brow? Whom, but the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, half frozen to death, overwhelmed with shame, and standing where Hester Prynne had stood!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，在他脑海中的肃穆幻象中又悄悄夹杂进来同样可怕的古怪念头。他感到由于不惯于夜间的凉意，四肢逐渐发僵，并且怀疑自己还能否走下刑台的台阶。天将破晓，他会被人发现站在台上。四邻将开始起身。最早起床的人踏人晨曦的微光，将会看到有个轮廓模糊的身形高高站在耻辱台上；于是便会在半惊骇半好奇之中走开去，敲开一家又一家的大门，叫人们出来看这已死的罪人的鬼魂——那人一定会这么想的。一阵破晓时的喧闹将从一家飞到另一家。之后，曙光渐明，老汉们会匆忙爬起身，穿上法兰绒长袍，主妇们则顾不上脱下她们的睡衣。那伙衣冠楚楚的人物，平素里从来没人见过他们有一丝头发散乱，此时也会遭了梦魇股的衣冠不整地就跑到了众人眼前。老总督贝灵汉会歪戴着他那詹姆士王时期的环状皱领，绷紧面孔走出来；西宾斯太太，由于彻夜邀游不曾阖眼，脸色会较平时更加难看，而裙上还会沾着林中细校；好心的威尔逊神父也会来的，他在死者床边熬了半夜，对于这么早就给从光荣的圣徒的美梦中惊醒，满肚子不高兴。到这里来的还会有了梅斯代尔先生教堂中的长老们和执事们，以及那些对自己的牧师祟拜之极、在她们洁白的心胸中为他立了圣龛的少女们；顺便说一下，她们此时正在慌乱之中，会根本来不及蒙上面巾。总而言之，所有的人都会磕磕绊绊地通过门槛，在刑台四周抬起惊惶的面孔。他们会依稀看到那里站着一个人，额上映着东方的红光，那会是谁呢？除去可敬的阿瑟·丁梅斯代尔先生还能是谁！他已经冻得半死，正满面羞惭地站在海丝特·白兰曾经示众的地方！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the minister, unawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a great peal of laughter. It was immediately responded to by a light, airy, childish laugh, in which, with a thrill of the heart -- but he knew not whether of exquisite pain, or pleasure as acute -- he recognised the tones of little Pearl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牧师的神思随着这一荒唐可怖的画面驰骋，在不知不觉之中突然爆发出一阵狂笑，一连他自己都大吃一惊。这狂笑立刻得到一声轻灵的童稚笑声的响应，随着一阵心悸——不过他弄不清到底是出于剧烈的痛楚抑或极度的欢乐——，他从笑声中辨出了小珠儿的腔调。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She silently ascended the steps, and stood on the platform, holding little Pearl by the hand. The minister felt for the child's other hand, and took it. The moment that he did so, there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life, other life than his own, pouring like a torrent into his heart, and hurrying through all his veins, as if the mother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his half-torpid system. The three formed an electric chain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她默默地踏上台阶，并且站到了台上，手中一直牵着小珠儿。牧师够着孩子的另一只手，也握住了。就在他这么做的瞬间，似有一般不同于他自己生命的新生命的激越之潮，急流般涌入他的心房，冲过他周身的血管，仿佛那母女俩正把她们生命的温暖传递给他半麻木的躯体。三人构成了一条闭合的电路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nay; not so, my little Pearl," answered the minister; for, with the new energy of the moment, all the dread of public exposure, that had so long been the anguish of his life, had returned upon him; and he was already trembling at the conjunction in which -- with a strange joy, nevertheless -- he now found himself. "Not so, my child. I shall, indeed, stand with thy mother and thee one other day, but not to-morrow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不成；不能那样，我的小珠儿，”牧师回答说；由于那瞬间的新精力，长期以来折磨着他生命的对示众的种种恐惧，又重新回到他心头；而且，他对目前的这种团聚——虽说也有一种陌生的欢偷——已经颤栗不安了。“那样不成，我的孩子。真的，终有一天，我一定同你妈妈和你站在一起，不过明天还不成。”珠儿笑着，想抽出她的手。但牧师紧紧地握住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在最后审判日，”牧师耳语说——说来奇怪，是他身为传播真理的牧师的职业感迫使他这么答复孩子的。“到了那一天，在审判座前面，你妈妈，你，还有我，应该站在一起。但这个世界的光天化日是不会看到我们在一起的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eye and heart, that the minister, looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the appearance of an immense letter -- the letter A -- marked out in lines of dull red light. Not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point, burning duskily through a veil of cloud; but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it; or, at least, with so little definiteness, that another's guilt might have seen another symbol in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，当牧师抬眼眺望天顶，看到出现了用暗红色的光线勾出的巨大字母“A”时，我们只能归结为他由于心病而眼睛出了毛病。这并非是说，当时根本没有流星出现并在云霭中隐隐燃烧；而是说并没有他那负罪的想象力所赋予的那种形状；或者，至少不是那么确定无疑——别的罪人也可能从中看到另一种象征呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was witchcraft in little Pearl's eyes; and her face, as she glanced upward at the minister, wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish.

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a singular circumstance that characterised Mr. Dimmesdale's psychological state at this moment. All the time that he gazed upward to the zenith, he was, nevertheless, perfectly aware that little Pearl was pointing her finger towards old Roger Chillingworth, who stood at no great distance from the scaffold. The minister appeared to see him, with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter. To his features, as to all other objects, the meteoric light imparted a new expression; or it might well be that the physician was not careful then, as at all other times, to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim. Certainly, if the meteor kindled up the sky, and disclosed the earth, with an awfulness that admonished Hester Prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment, then might Roger Chillingworth have passed with them for the arch-fiend, standing there with a smile and scowl, to claim his own. So vivid was the expression, or so intense the minister's perception of it, that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness, after the meteor had vanished, with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时还有一个特殊的细节可以说明了梅斯代尔先生的心理状态。在仰望天顶的整个过程中，他始终非常清楚，小珠儿在指着站得离刑台不远的老罗杰·齐灵渥斯。牧师似乎用辨出那神奇字母的同样目光，也看见了他。流星的亮光，如同对一切其它物体一样，也给予他的容貌一种崭新的表情；也可能是，医生当时没有象乎素那样小心地掩饰他看着自己的牺牲品时的那种恶毒样子。诚然，如果那流星照亮了天空，显现了大地，并以末日审判来威胁海丝特·白兰和牧师的话，那么，罗杰·齐灵渥斯就可以看作是魔王，他怒目狞笑地站在那里，等候着来认领他们。他的表情如此真切，或者说，牧师对其感觉是那么强烈，直到那流星殒落、街道及一切其它东西都立即湮灭之后，依然如画般地保持在黑暗中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Verily, and in good faith," answered Roger Chillingworth, "I knew nothing of the matter. I had spent the better part of the night at the bedside of the worshipful Governor Winthrop, doing what my poor skill might to give him ease. He going home to a better world, I, likewise, was on my way homeward, when this strange light shone out. Come with me, I beseech you, reverend sir; else you will be poorly able to do Sabbath duty to-morrow. Aha! see now, how they trouble the brain -- these books! -- these books! You should study less, good sir, and take a little pastime; or these night-whimseys will grow upon you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说真的，我讲的是实话，”罗杰·齐灵渥斯回答，“我对此一无所知。’我在那令人崇敬的温斯洛普总督的床边呆了大半夜，尽拙技之能为他减轻痛苦。他现正返回他美好世界的家，我呢，也在回家的路上，就在这时闪出了那道奇怪的光。跟我走吧，我求求你，可敬的先生；不然的话，明天安息日你就没法尽好责任了。啊哈！瞧啊，这些书本多么烦人啊——这些书本！——这些书本！你要少读点书，好先生，想法散散心；否则，这夜游症在你身上会越来越重的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day, however, being the Sabbath, he preached a discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful, and the most replete with heavenly influences, that had ever proceeded from his lips. Souls, it is said, more souls than one, were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon, and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards Mr. Dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter. But, as he came down the pulpit steps, the grey-bearded sexton met him, holding up a black glove, which the minister recognised as his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天恰好是安息日，他的布道被认为是他宣讲过的最丰富、最有力，也是最充满神启的。据称，不只一个人而是很多的灵魂领悟了那次布道的真谛，在内心中发誓今后要永远怀着对丁梅斯代尔先生的神圣的感激之情。但是，就在他走下讲坛的阶梯时，那灰胡须的教堂司役上来迎着他。那人手中举着一只黑手套，牧师认出了是自己的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," answered the minister, "I had not heard of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”牧师答道，“我没听说这件事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was found," said the sexton, "this morning, on the scaffold where evil-doers are set up to public shame. Satan dropped it there, I take it, intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence. But, indeed, he was blind and foolish, as he ever and always is. A pure hand needs no glove to cover it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是，”那司役说，“今天一早在干了坏事的人示众的刑台那儿发现的。我想，准是撒旦丢在那儿，有意中伤阁下您的。不过，说实在的，他还是跟平常一样，又瞎又蠢；而且会总是这样的。一只纯洁的手是不需要用手套来遮掩的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you, my good friend," said the minister gravely, but startled at heart; for, so confused was his remembrance, that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary. "Yes, it seems to be my glove, indeed!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，我的好朋友，”牧师庄重地说，心头却暗吃一惊；因为他的记忆已经紊乱，竟然把昨夜的事情看作是幻象了。“是啊，看来是我的手套，真的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And, since Satan saw fit to steal it, your reverence must needs handle him without gloves, henceforward," remarked the old sexton, grimly smiling. "But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night? -- a great red letter in the sky -- the letter A, which we interpret to stand for Angel. For, as our good Governor Winthrop was made an angel this past night, it was doubtless held fit that there should be some notice thereof!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，既然撒旦瞅机会偷了它去，阁下您以后就应该不戴手套去对付他了，”那老司役狞笑着说。“不过，阁下您听说昨天夜里人们看见的征兆了吗？——天上显出一个大红字母‘A’，我们都解释是代表‘天使’。因为，昨天夜里，我们那位善心的温斯洛普总督成了天使，所以不用说，上天要显显象才是呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
