<div class="line_en">The feeling was so strong that, as he was about to start work, Edmond stopped, put down his pickaxe, picked up the gun and climbed once more to the top of the highest pinnacle on the island, to take a broad, sweeping look at everything around.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun had travelled about one-third of its way across the sky and its invigorating May light fell on rocks that themselves seemed responsive to its warmth. Thousands of cicadas, invisible in the heather, produced a continuous, monotonous murmuring, while there was an almost metallic sound from the quivering leaves of the myrtles and the olive-trees. At each step that Edmond took on the hot granite he startled lizards, the colour of emeralds, and in the distance, on the sloping scree, he could see the wild goats that sometimes drew huntsmen to the place. In short, the island was inhabited, bustling with life; yet Edmond felt himself alone here in the hand of God. He experienced an intangible emotion, close to fear: the suspicion of daylight that makes us assume, even in the desert, that inquisitive eyes are upon us.</div>

<div class="line_en">It must be said that what attracted his attention was not the poetical island of Corsica, on which he could almost see the individual houses, or the almost unknown Sardinia that lay beyond it, or the isle of Elba with its associations of majesty, or even the barely perceptible line on the horizon on which the sailor's practised eye could sense the presence of proud Genoa and busy Leghorn. No: what he saw were the brig, which had left at daybreak, and the tartan, which had just set sail. The first was about to vanish in the straits of Bonifacio while the other, travelling in the opposite direction, was preparing to sail round Corsica.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他所凝视的地方，不是那房屋隐约可辨的科西嘉，也不是撒地尼亚，也不是那富有历史意义的爱尔巴岛，也不是延伸在地平线上那一条辨别不出的线条，而只有一个水手的老练的眼睛才能知道它是壮丽的热那亚和商业繁荣的里窝那。爱德蒙的眼睛所盯住的，是那艘清晨离开的双桅船，和刚才开出的那艘独桅船。前者刚刚渐渐消失到博尼法乔海峡里，后者所取的方向却正巧相反，已快要经过科西嘉岛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sight reassured Edmond. He began to look at the objects in his more immediate vicinity. He was on this highest point on the conical island, a slender statue on a huge pedestal. Beneath him, not a soul; around him, not a ship: nothing except the blue sea lapping round the base of the island and eternally ringing it in silver.</div>

<div class="line_en">So, by inductive logic, that thread which he had seen in Abbé Faria's hands guide his mind so ingeniously through the maze of probabilities, he considered that Cardinal Spada, who had reasons for not wishing to be seen, had landed in this creek, hidden his little boat, followed the route traced by the notches and, at the end of this trail, buried his treasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯根据法利亚长老所谆谆教导于他的方法详细推敲手中的线索，他想，红衣主教斯巴达，为了不让别人看到他的行动，曾到过这条小溪，把他的小帆船藏在里面，然后从山峡中循着留记号的这条小径走，在小径尽头的大石处埋下了他的宝藏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a result of this supposition, Dantès returned to the circular rock.</div>

<div class="line_en">Here, in effect, he saw that a slight slope had been made and that the rock had slid on its own base, before coming to a halt. Another rock, as large as a normal building stone, had served as a wedge. Stones and pebbles had been carefully moved to disguise any interference, and this sort of little dry-stone wall had been covered with soil. Grass had grown there, the moss had spread, some seeds of myrtle and mastic had fallen on it -- and the old rock looked as though it was soldered to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快就看出一道斜坡，岩石是顺着这条斜坡滑下来，一直滚到它现在所占的地点的。圆形的大岩石旁边，另有一块大石，这块大石一定是以前用来顶住大圆石的滚势的，岩石四周塞了许多石片和鹅蛋石来掩饰洞口，周围又盖以泥土，野草从泥土里生长了起来，苔藓布满了石面，金娘花也在那儿生了根，于是那块大石就象是根深蒂固地长在地面上的一样了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès cautiously removed the soil and recognized, or thought he recognized, all the ingenuity of the work. Then he started to attack this temporary wall, which time had cemented in place, with his pickaxe. After ten minutes' work, the wall gave way, leaving a hole large enough for his arm to pass through it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯小心地扒开泥土，来侦察——或他自以为在侦察——红衣主教的巧计。他用他的鹤嘴锄进攻这道被时间的手所封闭了的墙。在十分钟的劳动以后，这道墙屈服了，露出一个可以伸进一条手臂的洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès went and cut down the strongest olive-tree that he could find, stripped it of its branches, put it through the hole and used it as a lever. But the rock was too heavy and too solidly wedged against the rock beneath it for any human force, even that of Hercules, to move it. So Dantès decided that it was the wedge itself that had to be attacked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯砍断了一棵他所能找到的最结实的橄榄树，削去丫枝，插入洞里，把它当作杠子用。但那块岩石实在太重了，而且顶得非常结实，假如只有一个人的力量来搬动，就是大力士赫克里斯也是不行的。邓蒂斯知道他必须先进攻那块作为楔子的大石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come now, be a man!" he thought. "We are used to adversity; let's not be crushed by a mere disappointment, or else I shall have suffered for nothing. The heart breaks when it has swelled too much in the warm breath of hope, then finds itself enclosed in cold reality. Faria was dreaming: Cardinal Spada buried nothing in this cave, perhaps he never even came here or, if he did, Cesare Borgia, that intrepid adventurer, that dark and tireless robber, came after him, found his tracks, followed the same indications as I did, lifted this stone as I have and went down before me, leaving nothing behind him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，”他对自己说，“我是一个男子汉大丈夫。倒霉在我是常事，我绝对不能被失望所压倒。不然，我吃尽了那么多的苦有什么用呢？法利亚只是做了一场梦。红衣主教斯巴达并没有埋什么宝藏在这儿。或许他根本没有到这儿来过。即使他来过，凯撒·布琪亚，那个大胆的冒险家，那个百折不挠，偷偷摸摸的强盗，一定也曾跟踪来过，发现了他的痕迹，象我一样的循着这些记号到这里，象我一样的撬起这块石头，跑下洞去，他在我之前来过了，什么都没有留给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did so for only an instant. Then he put his lever into the ring and lifted.

Dantès stopped and paled, full of doubt.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们的命运，”他微笑着回答，“就象那些埋葬阿拉列①的人一样，同样被埋葬了。”【注：①阿拉列是古代西哥特人的国王。他死后，怕别人侵犯他的坟墓，所以把墓地设在河床下。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he went down, smiling sceptically and muttering the final word in human wisdom: "Perhaps!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"However, if he had come," Dantès continued, "he would have found the treasure and removed it.

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，假若他来过的话，”邓蒂斯想道，“他一定找到了那宝藏。而布琪亚，他既然把意大利比作一棵卷心菜，想一片一片把它剥来吃掉，当然对于时间的价值是知道得太清楚了，他就不会很费时间把这块大石再安放在原处。我还是下去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After spending a few seconds in this cave, where the air was warm rather than dank and sweet-smelling rather than stale, bearing the same relationship to the temperature of the island as the blue light did to the sun, Dantès could see into the furthest depths of the cavern, his eyesight (as we have previously mentioned) being accustomed to darkness. The walls were of granite, spangled and faceted so that they sparkled like diamonds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯在洞里站了几分钟，里面的空气并不潮湿，反倒很温暖，他的眼睛原是在黑暗中过惯了的，所以即使岩洞最深的角落也可以看得到。岩洞是花岗石构成的，闪闪发光，就象钻石似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead of the darkness that he had expected to find and a dense, fetid atmosphere, Dantès saw a gentle glow that was dispersed into bluish daylight: air and light not only came through the opening that he had just made, but also through fissures in the rocks that were invisible from the surface; through them could be seen the blue of the sky and the shivering branches of green oak-trees against it, with beneath them a tangled mass of brambles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯本来以为洞里一定很黑暗，空气一定带着浓重的臭味，但到了里面，他却看到一片浅蓝色的昏暗的光线，这种光线，也象空气一样，并非光从他刚才挖开的洞口里进来，而且也从岩石的裂缝里穿进来。这些在洞外是看不到的，但到了洞里，他却可以透过它们看到蔚蓝的天空，和那些在石缝里生长起来的常春藤，卷须蔓和野草的枝叶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但他想起了遗嘱上的话，那些话他心里记得很熟。红衣主教的遗嘱说：“在第二洞口最深之一角。”他所找到的只是第一个洞窟。他现在得把第二个也找出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He sought to get his bearings. The second cavern should naturally extend towards the centre of the island. He looked closely at the base of the rocks and tapped on the wall in which, he thought, the opening ought to be, having been disguised for reasons of security.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯开始他的搜索。他心里想，这第二个洞窟自然在岛的较深处，而且为了预防被人发觉，自然也是很隐蔽的。他仔细在石块间察看，看到有一面洞壁象是洞口，就敲敲听声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pickaxe rang for a moment against the rock, sending back a flat sound, the solidity of which brought sweat to Dantès' brow. Finally, the persistent miner thought that one section of the granite wall answered his enquiry with a rounder and deeper echo.

<div class="line_en">Then he perceived something odd, which was that as he struck it a sort of outer coating, like the plaster that is put on walls before painting a fresco, was breaking off and falling in flakes, to reveal a whitish soft stone, like an ordinary building stone. The opening in the rocks had been closed with a different type of stone and this plaster had been spread over it, then painted to imitate the colour and lustre of granite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，一件奇迹出现了。当他敲上去的时候，壁上掉下一块象阿拉伯式雕刻衬底用的那种涂料，跌在地上碎得如片片鱼鳞，露出一块白色的大石来。这个洞口是用一种在上面抹了一层色彩透明的涂料，象花岗石那样的石块来封锁的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès struck the surface with the sharp end of the pick and it sank about an inch into the wall. This was the point at which he should dig.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because of a mysterious property of the human organism, the more Dantès should have been reassured by this mounting proof that Faria had not been mistaken, the more his heart gave way to doubt and even to discouragement. This new experiment, which should have given him renewed strength, took away the little that remained: the pickaxe dropped towards the ground, almost slipping out of his hands; he put it down, wiped his brow and went back into the daylight, telling himself that this was because he wanted to make sure that no one was spying on him, but in reality because he needed air, feeling as though he were about to faint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但由于人体上某种奇怪的现象，邓蒂斯越是看到眼前这些证据，证实了法利亚长老的话，他非但不觉得定心，反而越来越感到无力、沮丧，几乎失去了勇气。这最后的证据不但没有使他增加新的力量，而且把他原有的力量也剥夺了去。鹤嘴锄落下来的时候，几乎从他的手里滑了出来。他把它放到地上，用手抹一抹额头，回身跑上石级，算是去看看有没有人在窥视他，但实际上是因为他觉得快要昏倒了需要呼吸新鲜空气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, to avoid wasted effort (having, like Cesare Borgia, learned the value of time), he tapped the other walls with his pick, tried the ground with the butt of his gun and cleared the sand in some suspicious places, until, finding nothing, he came back to the section of wall that had given this encouraging sound. He struck it again, with greater force.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a few blows he noticed that the stones were not cemented but simply laid one on top of the other and covered with the plaster that we mentioned. He inserted the point of the pick into the gap between them, put his weight on the handle and was overjoyed to see the stone fall down at his feet. After that, he only had to pull each stone towards him with the head of the pickaxe and, one by one, they fell down beside the first.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès had eaten nothing so far, but he could not think of wasting time on food at such a moment; he took a swig of rum and went back into the cavern with renewed vigour.

<div class="line_en">Finally, after a last moment of hesitation, Dantès went from the first cavern into the second. It was lower, darker and more frightening than the first. The air, which only came through the opening he had just made, had the musty smell that he had been surprised not to find in the first cavern. Before entering, he allowed the outside air time to freshen this dead atmosphere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，在一阵新的怀疑以后，邓蒂斯进入到第二个洞窟。这第二洞窟地势较第一洞窟低，光线也较第一洞阴暗，空气因为只能从新开的洞口进来，所以带有一种腐臭气味，这正是在第一洞窟中所没有而使邓蒂斯感到诧异的。他出来等了一会儿，让新鲜的空气去代替那不洁的空气，然后再进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought for a moment, then cut a branch from a resinous tree, went to light it at the still-smoking fire where the smugglers had cooked their dinner, and returned with this torch. He did not want to miss a single detail of what he was about to see.</div>

In the centre of the lid, on a silver plate that the earth had not tarnished, shone the arms of the Spada family: a sword lying vertically across an oval shield (that being the shape of Italian shields), with a cardinal's hat above it. Dantès recognized it at once: Faria had often drawn it for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一霎时，挖开了一块三呎长两呎宽的地面，邓蒂斯看到一只橡木钱柜，外面包着已被挖破的铁皮。在箱盖的中央，他看到镶着一块银片，尚未失去光泽，上面雕刻着斯巴达家族的武器，就是，一面椭圆形的盾牌，样子和意大利一般武器的式样差不多，上面插着一把宝剑，在剑和盾之上则是一顶红衣主教的帽子。邓蒂斯一看就认得，因为法利亚以前曾常常画给他看。">查看中文翻译</div>
