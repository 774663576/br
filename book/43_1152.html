<div class="line_en">Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. She could not think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of "Mrs. March bein' told, and worried just for sech a trifle."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she 'would think of it, though there was no danger yet'. A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a long while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔日以继夜地侍候贝思——这任务并不艰巨，因为贝思十分坚强，一声不吭地忍受着身体上的痛苦，只要她能控制住自己。但有一次猩红热发作时，她声音嘶哑地说起了胡话，把床罩当作自己心爱的小钢琴弹起来，并试图唱歌，终因喉咙肿胀而无法唱出来；另一次，她连身边那几张熟悉的面孔也认不出来，竟把亲人叫错了，还一声声地哀叫母亲。乔被吓坏了，梅格也求罕娜让她写信告知真相，甚至罕娜也说：“虽然还没有危险，但同意考虑考虑。”而此时，华盛顿又发来一信，告知她们马奇先生病情恶化了，短期内不可能回家，这更增添了她们的烦恼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Everyone missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寄人篱下的艾美热切地盼望着能够回家为贝思尽点心意，她现在不再觉得家务是件令人烦闷的苦差事了。每当想到贝思自愿为她做的许多被忽略掉的活儿时，她就又是惭愧又是心酸。劳里整日愁眉锁眼，像个不安宁的鬼魂一样在屋子里游转。劳伦斯先生锁上了大钢琴，因为他无法忍受一看到大钢琴就想到他的小邻居曾给他带来多少黄昏的慰藉。大家都惦记着贝思。送奶的、面包师傅、杂货店老板、肉贩都询问她的情况，可怜的赫梅尔太太过来为明娜拿寿衣时请求大家原谅她的愚昧无知，邻居们也纷纷送上各式各样的慰问品和祝福，连最熟悉她的人此刻都诧异，腼腆的小贝思竟然交了这么多朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home. Then it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy -- in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or beauty.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah, "If Mrs. March can leave her husband she'd better be sent for."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十二月一日对她们来说是个名符其实的严冬。这天寒风呼啸、大雪纷飞，似乎预示着这一年气数已荆当邦斯医生这天早上过来的时候，他久久望着贝思，把她那热得烫人的手放在自己双手里紧紧握了一会，然后轻轻放下，声调低沉地对罕娜说：“如果马奇太太能够离开丈夫，最好现在回来一趟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege. She longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时贝思躺在床上，身边是她心爱的乔安娜，即使在神志恍惚之际她也没有忘记这个身世悲惨的玩偶。她也舍不得那几只猫儿，但因担心它们会染上病而没有让人把它们放在身边。病情安定的时候，她总是忧心忡忡，唯恐乔会有个三长两短。她问候艾美，请姐妹们告诉母亲她很快就会写信去，并常常求她们给她纸和笔，勉强写上片言只语，使父亲不至于以为自己忽略了他。但不久这种短暂的清醒状态也结束了，她一卧不起，在床上翻来覆去，语无伦次地说些胡话，有时又昏昏睡去，醒来时仍然气息奄奄。邦斯医生一天来两次，罕娜晚间守夜，梅格写好一封电报放在书桌上，准备随时发出，乔更是不敢从贝思身边移开半步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly, "What is it? Is Beth worse?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罕娜点点头，说不出一句话语，只是紧张得双唇不断地抖动；梅格闻听此言，仿佛四肢的力量被抽了个精光，一下跌倒在椅子上；乔脸色煞白地呆了一会，跑到客厅，一把抓起电报，仓皇披上衣帽，一头冲进狂风暴雪之中。她很快便回来了，正轻轻脱下大衣的时候，劳里手持一封信走进来，告诉她马奇先生的病情又好转了。乔激动地把信读了一遍，但心情仍然异常沉重，劳里见她神情悲恸，忙问：“怎么了？贝思的病又重了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat, "I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泪水顺着乔的双颊大滴大滴滚落，她六神无主地伸出手，仿佛在黑暗中摸索，劳里一把把她的手握住，只觉得喉咙也哽住了，好不容易才轻声说道：“我在这里呢。抓紧我吧，乔，亲爱的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳里很想说几句贴心的宽慰话，一时却找不到合适的词语，只是一言不发地站着，无限怜爱地轻轻抚摸着她低下来的脑袋。这种无声的抚慰胜似千言万语。乔感到了这无声的怜爱，在静默之中体会到了这由喜爱加在悲哀中的甜甜的宽慰，心里觉得好受些了，便把眼泪擦干，感激地抬起头来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm so glad Father is better. Now she won't feel so bad about leaving him. Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders," sighed Jo, spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“幸好爸爸病情好转了；这样妈妈回来也不至于放心不下。噢，老天！怎么灾祸来了一个又一个，我身上的担子比？谁的都重。”乔叹了一口气，把她的湿手绢打开，铺在膝头上风干。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and she won't miss her as I shall. Beth is my conscience, and I can't give her up. I can't! I can't!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it. Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, "I don't think she will die. She's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe God will take her away yet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔把脸埋在湿手绢里，失声痛哭，刚才她一直坚强地忍着，没有流一滴泪。劳里用手抹抹眼睛，想说点什么，但只觉得嗓子眼被什么东西堵住了，嘴唇也在不停颤抖。这也许没有男子气，但他忍不住，我对此深感高兴。一会儿，待乔的啜平静了下来，他这才满怀希望地说：“我想她不会死的；她这么善良，我们又这么爱她，我不信上帝就这样把她夺走。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, "I drink -- Health to my Beth! You are a good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend. How can I ever pay you?" she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="乔脸色发白地从座椅中一跃而起，待他一住口便直扑过去，用双臂搂紧他的膀子，高兴地又叫又喊：“啊，劳里！啊，妈妈！我高兴死了！”她不再啜泣，而是歇斯底里地笑起来，一面颤抖一面搂紧她的朋友，仿佛被这突如起来的消息弄得意乱神迷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't mind," laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. "Why, you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive us if Beth… Well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram. I never can bear to be 'lorded over', so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in at two A. M. I shall go for her, and you've only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这我倒不介意，”劳里笑道，一面理好领带，”是这样，你知道我和爷爷都十分焦急，我们认为罕娜僭越职权，而你妈妈应该知道这事。如果贝思——如果一旦出了事，她永远都不会原谅我们。所以我让爸爸说出该采取行动这话，昨天便飞快赶到邮局，你也知道医生神色严峻，而罕娜一听说发电报就几乎要拧下我的脑袋。我一向不能忍受被人‘管制’，于是打定主意，把电报发了。你妈妈就要回来，我知道火车凌晨两点到站，我去接，你只需收敛一下你的狂喜之情，安顿好贝思，专候佳音。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind. He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying breathlessly, "Oh, don't! I didn't mean to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don't give me wine again, it makes me act so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳里大吃了一惊，却表现得相当镇定；他轻轻拍着她的背脊，见她正逐渐恢复过来，便腼腆地在她脸上吻了一两下。乔刹那间如梦方醒。她扶着楼梯扶手，把他轻轻推开，气喘吁吁地说：“噢，别这样！我刚才昏了头，不是故意要扑向你，你这么听话，竟然不顾罕娜的反对给妈妈发电报，所以我忍不祝把事情经过告诉我吧，别再给我酒喝了，它令我胡作非为。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah "knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected". A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change. Beth's bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness, and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, "Mother's coming, dear! Mother's coming!" Every one rejoiced but Beth. She lay in that heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, "Water!" with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. All day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some change, for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which time he would return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅格不露声色地狂喜一番，然后对信沉思；乔整理病房，罕娜则在“赶快做两个饼，免得还有什么人会一起来”。屋子里仿佛吹过了一阵清风，寂静的房间也被什么比阳光还要明亮的东西照得亮堂起来。每种事情都好像感觉到了这充满希望的变化；贝思的小鸟开始重新鸣唱，艾美的花丛里发现了一朵半开的玫瑰；炉火也燃烧得特别欢畅；梅格和乔每次碰面，苍白的脸上都绽出笑容，她们紧紧拥抱，悄声鼓励：“妈妈就要回来了，亲爱的！妈妈就要回来了！”大家都欢欣鼓舞，只有贝思昏迷不醒，躺在床上，无知无觉，无喜无忧。她的形容令人心碎——原来红润的脸庞变得没有一点血色，原来灵巧的双手瘦得只剩下皮包骨头，原来微笑的双唇几乎找不到气息，原来漂亮整齐的头发零乱不堪地散落在枕头上。整整一天她都这么躺着，只是偶尔醒来才含混不清地说一声：“水！”由于唇干舌燥，声音几乎发不出来；乔和梅格整天都在她身边侍候，照看着、等待着、盼望着，相信上帝和母亲能创造奇迹；整整一天大雪纷飞，狂风怒吼，时间过得特别缓慢。最后，黑夜终于降临。姐妹俩仍然各坐在床的一边，每当时钟敲响便互相交换一下眼色，眼睛闪闪发亮，因为时钟每响一下，希望就拉近一步。医生来过，说大约午夜时分病情就可见分晓，或是好转，或是恶化，他届时再来看视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's countenance as she entered. Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="疲倦不堪的罕娜倒在床脚边的沙发上，呼呼大睡；劳伦斯先生在客厅里踱来踱去，他宁愿面对一个造反的炮兵连，也不愿看到马奇太太进来时焦不安的神色；劳里躺在地毯上，佯作休息，其实是在盯着火苗想心事，那若有所思的神情使他的黑眼睛显得清澈温柔，异常漂亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station. Another hour, still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时时钟敲响十二下，两人一心守护着贝思，早就忘掉了自己，恍惚间觉得那张状如死灰的脸庞掠过一丝变化。屋里依然一片死寂，只有呼号的狂风打破这深深的寂静。倦极的罕娜仍在酣睡，姐妹两人看到贝思的脸色开始泛白，犹如有一个白色的幽灵在床上作祟。一个小时过去了，情况依旧，只听到劳里的车悄悄往车站去了。又过了一个小时——仍不见有人来，姐妹俩心里开始七上八下，一会儿担心母亲被暴风雪耽搁，一会儿又担心路上发生意外，更害怕华盛顿那边发生什么不测。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's easy chair with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, "Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="已是深夜两点多钟，乔站在窗边，正在感叹这雪花漫卷的世界是多么乏味，突然听到床边什么东西响了一下，赶紧回头一望，只见梅格掩脸跪在母亲的安乐椅前。乔吓得心胆俱裂，浑身发凉，暗暗想道：“贝思去了，梅格不敢告诉我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, "The fever's turned, she's sleepin' nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my goodness me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是听到了响动，罕娜蓦然惊醒，三步并作两步走到床前，看看贝思，摸摸她的双手，听一下鼻息，接着把围裙向头上一抛，坐在椅子上摇来摇去，压低声音叫道：“烧热退掉了！她正在熟睡，皮肤汗津津的，气息也平和了。谢天谢地！噢，老天可怜！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, "Good-by, my Beth. Good-by!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她立即走回床前，激动的双眼仿佛看到了惊人的变化。贝思退了烧，痛苦的神情已经消失，仿佛沉沉睡去，那张可爱的小脸显得异常苍白而平静，乔见状竟感觉不到生离死别的痛苦。她弯下身子，注视着这位自己最疼爱的妹妹，在她湿漉漉的额头上深深一吻，轻声说道：“再见！我的贝思，再见！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, "Yes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her…"</div>
