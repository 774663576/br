<div class="line_en">"He has landed," she said aloud. "It is finished." Then, surging up, puffing slightly, old Mr Carmichael stood beside her, looking like an old pagan god, shaggy, with weeds in his hair and the trident (it was only a French novel) in his hand. He stood by her on the edge of the lawn, swaying a little in his bulk and said, shading his eyes with his hand: "They will have landed," and she felt that she had been right. They had not needed to speak. They had been thinking the same things and he had answered her without her asking him anything. He stood there as if he were spreading his hands over all the weakness and suffering of mankind; she thought he was surveying, tolerantly and compassionately, their final destiny. Now he has crowned the occasion, she thought, when his hand slowly fell, as if she had seen him let fall from his great height a wreath of violets and asphodels which, fluttering slowly, lay at length upon the earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He must have reached it," said Lily Briscoe aloud, feeling suddenly completely tired out. For the Lighthouse had become almost invisible, had melted away into a blue haze, and the effort of looking at it and the effort of thinking of him landing there, which both seemed to be one and the same effort, had stretched her body and mind to the utmost. Ah, but she was relieved. Whatever she had wanted to give him, when he left her that morning, she had given him at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他肯定已经到了。”莉莉·布里斯柯大声说道，突然感到精疲力竭。因为灯塔已经几乎看不见了，融化成了一片蓝色的雾霭，为看清灯塔和想像他在那里上岸所作的努力，这两者似乎是完全一样的努力，已经使她的身心紧张到了极点。但是，啊，她现在感到宽慰。当他清早离开时她想给予他的不论什么东西，她终于给了他了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Quickly, as if she were recalled by something over there, she turned to her canvas. There it was -- her picture. Yes, with all its greens and blues, its lines running up and across, its attempt at something. It would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be destroyed. But what did that matter? she asked herself, taking up her brush again. She looked at the steps; they were empty; she looked at her canvas; it was blurred. With a sudden intensity, as if she saw it clear for a second, she drew a line there, in the centre. It was done; it was finished. Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigue, I have had my vision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她仿佛受到了那边什么东西的召唤，迅速转向她的画布。它在那儿——她的画。是的，它有着绿色和蓝色，有着上下左右的线条，以及它所企图表达的什么，全都在那儿。它会被挂在阁楼上，她想；它会被毁坏掉。但是那有什么关系呢？她问自己，再一次拿起了画笔：她看着台阶；上面空落落的；她看着画布；上面一片模糊。在突如其来的激情之下，仿佛她刹那间清楚地看到了它，她在画布的中央画上了一道线。画完了；结束了。是的，她在极度疲乏中放下画笔，心想，我已看到了最美好的景象。">查看中文翻译</div>
