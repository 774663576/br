<div class="line_en">So many stars, he thought as he trudged up the slope through pines and firs and ash. Maester Luwin had taught him his stars as a boy in Winterfell; he had learned the names of the twelve houses of heaven and the rulers of each; he could find the seven wanderers sacred to the Faith; he was old friends with the Ice Dragon, the Shadowcat, the Moonmaid, and the Sword of the Morning. All those he shared with Ygritte, but not some of the others. We look up at the same stars, and see such different things. The King's Crown was the Cradle, to hear her tell it; the Stallion was the Horned Lord; the red wanderer that septons preached was sacred to their Smith up here was called the Thief. And when the Thief was in the Moonmaid, that was a propitious time for a man to steal a woman, Ygritte insisted. "Like the night you stole me. The Thief was bright that night."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you have names for them as well?" Jon asked, as he went to one knee beside the direwolf and scratched the thick white fur on his neck, "The Hare? The Doe? The She-Wolf?" Ghost licked his face, his rough wet tongue rasping against the scabs where the eagle's talons had ripped Jon's cheek. The bird marked both of us, he thought. "Ghost," he said quietly, "on the morrow we go over. There's no steps here, no cage-andcrane, no way for me to get you to the other side. We have to part. Do you understand?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也在给它们取名字吗？”琼恩边问，边单膝跪在冰原狼身旁，挠挠他脖子上厚厚的白毛，“野兔座？母鹿座？狼女座？”白灵转头舔他的脸，粗糙的舌头摩擦着琼恩脸颊上被鹰爪抓裂的血痂。那只鸟给我俩都留下了伤疤，他心想。“白灵，”他平静地说，“明天我们就要去了。那儿没有楼梯，没有起重机和铁笼子，没有方法可以让你越过。所以我们不得不分开，你明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He found Ghost atop the hill, as he thought he might. The white wolf never howled, yet something drew him to the heights all the same, and he would squat there on his hindquarters, hot breath rising in a white mist as his red eyes drank the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不出所料，他在山顶找到白灵。这头白狼从来不叫，却不知怎地非常喜欢高处。此刻他后腿蹲坐，腾腾呼吸化成升起的白雾，红色双眸吸入群星的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you kill a man, and never mean t', he's just as dead," Ygritte said stubbornly. Jon had never met anyone so stubborn, except maybe for his little sister Arya. Is she still my sister? he wondered. Was she ever? He had never truly been a Stark, only Lord Eddard's motherless bastard, with no more place at Winterfell than Theon Greyjoy. And even that he'd lost. When a man of the Night's Watch said his words, he put aside his old family and joined a new one, but Jon Snow had lost those brothers too.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You cannot come with me," Jon said, cupping the wolf's head in his hands and looking deep into those eyes. "You have to go to Castle Black. Do you understand? Castle Black. Can you find it? The way home? just follow the ice, east and east, into the sun, and you'll find it. They will know you at Castle Black, and maybe your coming will warn them." He had thought of writing out a warning for Ghost to carry, but he had no ink, no parchment, not even a writing quill, and the risk of discovery was too great. "I will meet you again at Castle Black, but you have to get there by yourself. We must each hunt alone for a time. Alone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不能再跟着我，”琼恩双手捧着冰原狼的脑袋，深深注视进那对红眼睛。“你得去黑城堡，明白吗？黑城堡。能找到吗？回家的路？只要顺着冰墙，往东往冬再往东，向着太阳的方向，你就会到的，到时候黑城堡的人也会认出你，并得到警告。”他曾想过写信，让白灵带着，但他没有墨水，没有羊皮纸，甚至没有鹅毛笔，而且被发现的危险太大。“我会在黑城堡跟你重逢，但你得自己先去。让我们暂时单独捕猎。单独行动。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the dark, the direwolf's red eyes looked black. He nuzzled at Jon's neck, silent as ever, his breath a hot mist. The wildlings called Jon Snow a warg, but if so he was a poor one. He did not know how to put on a wolf skin, the way Orell had with his eagle before he'd died. Once Jon had dreamed that he was Ghost, looking down upon the valley of the Milkwater where Mance Rayder had gathered his people, and that dream had turned out to be true. But he was not dreaming now, and that left him only words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗中，冰原狼的红眼睛回望着他。他拱拱琼恩的脖子，一如往常地安静，呼吸化为热气。野人们把琼恩称为狼灵，假如真是的话，他也是个没用的狼灵。他不懂如何进入狼的体内，像欧瑞尔和他的鹰。过去有一回，琼恩梦到自己就是白灵，俯视着乳河河谷，发现曼斯·雷德正在那里聚集人马，而这个梦最后成为了现实。可从此以后他不再做梦，只能靠嘴巴说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The direwolf twisted free of Jon's grasp, his ears pricked up. And suddenly he was bounding away. He loped through a tangle of brush, leapt a deadfall, and raced down the hillside, a pale streak among the trees. Off to Castle Black? Jon wondered. Or off after a hare? He wished he knew. He feared he might prove just as poor a warg as a sworn brother and a spy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冰原狼挣脱琼恩的抓握，竖起耳朵，突然跳跃着跑开，大步穿越一丛杂乱的灌木，跃过一棵倒下的死树，奔下山坡，仿佛林间一道白影。他是去黑城堡？琼恩疑惑地想，还是去追野兔呢？他希望自己知道。恐怕到头来我做狼灵就跟当守夜人和间谍一样差劲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A wind sighed through the trees, rich with the smell of pine needles, tugging at his faded blacks. Jon could see the Wall looming high and dark to the south, a great shadow blocking out the stars. The rough hilly ground made him think they must be somewhere between the Shadow Tower and Castle Black, and likely closer to the former. For days they had been wending their way south between deep lakes that stretched like long thin fingers along the floors of narrow valleys, while flint ridges and pine-clad hills jostled against one another to either side. Such ground made for slow riding, but offered easy concealment for those wishing to approach the Wall unseen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寒风在树林中叹息，卷动着松针的气味，拉扯他褪色的黑衣。黑乎乎的长城高耸在南，如一巨大阴影，遮挡星星。由此处起伏不平的地形来看，他判断他们正在影子塔和黑城堡之间，可能更靠近前者。数日以来，队伍一直在深湖之间南行，这些湖泊像手指般细长，沿狭窄的山谷底部延伸，两侧是岩石山脊和松树覆盖、竞相攀比的山岗。这种地形会减慢速度，但对于想悄悄接近长城的人而言，提供了最好的遮蔽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beyond that Wall lay the Seven Kingdoms, and everything he had sworn to protect. He had said the words, had pledged his life and honor, and by rights he should be up there standing sentry. He should be raising a horn to his lips to rouse the Night's Watch to arms. He had no horn, though. it would not be hard to steal one from the wildlings, he suspected, but what would that accomplish? Even if he blew it, there was no one to hear. The Wall was a hundred leagues long and the Watch sadly dwindled. All but three of the strongholds had been abandoned; there might not be a brother within forty miles of here, but for Jon. If he was a brother still…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长城另一边就是七大王国，就是一切他要守护的东西。他发下誓言，立志献出生命与荣耀，理应在那边站岗放哨，理当吹起号角，提醒兄弟们武装起来。虽然他此刻没有号角，但从野人那儿偷一个并不难，可这有什么用呢？即使吹了，也没人听见，长城足有一百里格之长，而守夜人军团的规模小得令人悲哀。除开三座堡垒，其余部分都疏于防备，沿途四十里之内也许不会有一个弟兄。当然，有他琼恩，假如他还算一个的话…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I should have tried to kill Mance Rayder on the Fist, even if it meant my life. That was what Qhorin Halfhand would have done. But Jon had hesitated, and the chance passed. The next day he had ridden off with Styr the Magnar, Jarl, and more than a hundred picked Therms and raiders. He told himself that he was only biding his time, that when the moment came he would slip away and ride for Castle Black. The moment never came. They rested most nights in empty wildling villages, and Styr always set a dozen of his Therms to guard the horses. Jarl watched him suspiciously. And Ygritte was never far, day or night.</div>

<div class="line_en">His body had played the part eagerly enough. His lips on hers, his hand sliding under her doeskin shirt to find a breast, his manhood stiffening when she rubbed her mound against it through their clothes. My vows, he'd thought, remembering the weirwood grove where he had said them, the nine great white trees in a circle, the carved red faces watching, listening. But her fingers were undoing his laces and her tongue was in his mouth and her hand slipped inside his smallclothes and brought him out, and he could not see the weirwoods anymore, only her. She bit his neck and he nuzzled hers, burying his nose in her thick red hair. Lucky, he thought, she is lucky, fire-kissed. "Isn't that good?" she whispered as she guided him inside her. She was sopping wet down there, and no maiden, that was plain, but Jon did not care. His vows, her maidenhood, none of it mattered, only the heat of her, the mouth on his, the finger that pinched at his nipple. "Isn't that sweet?" she said again. "Not so fast, oh, slow, yes, like that. There now, there now, yes, sweet, sweet. You know nothing, Jon Snow, but I can show you. Harder now. Yessss."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的身体当然不曾违抗，反而热切地应和，嘴唇紧贴，手指滑进对方的鹿皮衬衣，找到乳房。当她抬起下体隔着衣服蹭他时，那话儿立刻硬起来。我的誓言，他企图聚集心神，回想发下誓词时的那个鱼梁木小丛林，九株白色大树环成一圈，九张脸向圆心凝视、聆听。但她的手指在解他的衣带，她的舌头在他嘴里，她的双手滑进他的裤子，将它拉了出来。他再也看不到鱼梁木，只能看见她。她咬他的脖子，他则拱她的脖子，将鼻子埋进浓密的红发中。幸运，他心想，火吻而生，乃是幸运的象征。“感觉好吗？”她一边低语，一边引导他进入。她下面湿透了，而且明显不是处女，但琼恩不在乎。他的誓言，她的贞操，都没关系，惟有热度，惟有她的嘴唇，惟有她夹着他乳头的手指。“感觉甜美吧？”她又问，“别那么快，哦，慢点，对，就这样。就是那儿，就是那儿，对，亲爱的，亲爱的。你什么都不懂，琼恩·雪诺，但我可以教你。现在用力一点。对——”">查看中文翻译</div>

I am playing the part the Halfhand told me to play.</div>

<div class="line_en">The proving had been so sweet, though, and Ygritte had gone to sleep beside him with her head against his chest, and that was sweet as well, dangerously sweet. He thought of the weirwoods again, and the words he'd said before them. It was only once, and it had to be. Even my father stumbled once, when he forgot his marriage vows and sired a bastard. Jon vowed to himself that it would be the same with him. It will never happen again.</div>

<div class="line_en">It happened twice more that night, and again in the morning, when she woke to find him hard. The wildlings were stirring by then, and several could not help but notice what was going on beneath the pile of furs. Jarl told them to be quick about it, before he had to throw a pail of water over them. Like a pair of rutting dogs, Jon thought afterward. Was that what he'd become? I am a man of the Night's Watch, a small voice inside insisted, but every night it seemed a little fainter, and when Ygritte kissed his ears or bit his neck, he could not hear it at all. Was this how it was for my father? he wondered. Was he as weak as I am, when he dishonored himself in my mother's bed?</div>

<div class="line_en">The mouth of the cave was a cleft in the rock barely wide enough for a horse, half concealed behind a soldier pine. It opened to the north, so the glows of the fires within would not be visible from the Wall. Even if by some mischance a patrol should happen to pass atop the Wall tonight, they would see nothing but hills and pines and the icy sheen of starlight on a half-frozen lake. Mance Rayder had planned his thrust well.</div>

Cookfires burned amongst the columns, their smoke rising to blacken the stony ceiling. The horses had been hobbled along one wall, beside a shallow pool. A sinkhole in the center of the floor opened on what might have been an even greater cavern below, though the darkness made it hard to tell. Jon could hear the soft rushing sound of an underground stream somewhere below as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jarl was with the Magnar; Mance had given them the joint command. Styr was none too pleased by that, Jon had noted early on. Mance Rayder had called the dark youth a "pet" of Val, who was sister to Dalla, his own queen, which made Jarl a sort of good brother once removed to the King-beyond-the-Wall. The Magnar plainly resented sharing his authority. He had brought a hundred Therms, five times as many men as Jarl, and often acted as if he had the sole command. But it would be the younger man who got them over the ice, Jon knew. Though he could not have been older than twenty, Jarl had been raiding for eight years, and had gone over the Wall a dozen times with the likes of Alfyn Crowkiller and the Weeper, and more recently with his own band.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾尔跟马格拿在一起，曼斯让他们共同指挥。琼恩注意到，斯迪对此不太高兴。曼斯·雷德把那皮肤黝黑的青年称为瓦迩的“宠物”，而瓦迩是曼斯的王后妲娜之妹，所以按身份论，贾尔等于是塞外之王的兄弟，马格拿不情愿又不能不与他分享权力。但他带来一百个瑟恩人，是贾尔手下的五倍，而且通常单独行动。不管怎么说，琼恩知道，领他们翻越冰墙的将是那年轻人，贾尔尽管不满二十岁，但参加掠袭已有八年之久，不仅随猎鸦阿夫因、哭泣者等人越过长城十几次，最近又有了自己的小队。">查看中文翻译</div>

He would have liked nothing better than to refuse the brusque demand, but he knew Styr would put him to death at the slightest disloyalty, and Ygritte as well, for the crime of being his. "There are four men in each patrol, two rangers and two builders," he said. "The builders are supposed to make note of cracks, melting, and other structural problems, while the rangers look for signs of foes. They ride mules."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mules?" The earless man frowned. "Mules are slow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“骡子？”无耳人皱起眉头，“骡子很慢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Slow, but more surefooted on the ice. The patrols often ride atop the Wall, and aside from Castle Black, the paths up there have not been graveled for long years. The mules are bred at Eastwatch, and specially trained to their duty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“慢是慢，但在冰上步子稳健。巡逻队通常在长城上骑行，而除了黑城堡周围，冰墙上的路已很多年没铺碎石了。骡子在东海望抚养长大，是专为这一任务而训练的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. One patrol in four follows the base instead, to search for cracks in the foundation ice or signs of tunneling."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是。每四次巡逻中有一次沿基部走，以寻找裂缝或挖掘的迹象。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They often ride atop the Wall? Not always?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“通常在长城上骑行？不是每次？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon shrugged. "It changes. I've heard that Lord Commander Qorgyle used to send them out every third day from Castle Black to Eastwatch-bythe-Sea, and every second day from Castle Black to the Shadow Tower. The Watch had more men in his day, though. Lord Commander Mormont prefers to vary the number of patrols and the days of their departure, to make it more difficult for anyone to know their comings and goings. And sometimes the Old Bear will even send a larger force to one of the abandoned castles for a fortnight or a moon's turn." His uncle had originated that tactic, Jon knew. Anything to make the enemy unsure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩耸耸肩。“一直在变。据说从前的科格尔总司令每三天派一队人由黑城堡去海边的东海望，每两天派一队人从黑城堡到影子塔，然而那时守夜人军团的人数较多，到莫尔蒙总司令的时代，巡逻次数和出发日期一直在变，教人难以捉摸。有时熊老甚至会派大部队去废弃的城堡居住两周到一个月。”这是叔叔的主意，琼恩知道，为了迷惑敌人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon knew the tale as well. Arson Iceaxe had been halfway through the Wall when his tunnel was found by rangers from the Nightfort. They did not trouble to disturb him at his digging, only sealed the way behind with ice and stone and snow. Dolorous Edd used to say that if you pressed your ear flat to the Wall, you could still hear Arson chipping away with his axe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩听过这故事。冰斧亚森挖穿了一半的冰墙，却在这时被长夜堡的游骑兵发现，他们没费神阻挠，而用冰雪和岩石封住了亚森的后路。忧郁的艾迪曾说，假如把耳朵贴住长城，至今还能听见里面的挖凿声呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How many crows remain within the castles?" asked Styr.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城堡里剩下多少乌鸦？”斯迪道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So we're between those two, are we? Jon kept his face carefully blank. "Only Eastwatch, Castle Black, and the Shadow Tower were manned when I left the Wall. I can't speak to what Bowen Marsh or Ser Denys might have done since."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们就在这两者之间，对不对？琼恩尽力不露声色。“我离开长城时，只有东海望、黑城堡和影子塔有守军。我说不准此后波文·马尔锡和丹尼斯爵士有何举动。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“石门寨有人驻守吗？”贾尔问，“灰卫堡呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Five hundred at Castle Black. Two hundred at Shadow Tower, perhaps three hundred at Eastwatch." Jon added three hundred men to the count. If only it were that easy…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黑城堡五百，影子塔两百，东海望也许三百。”琼恩将总数加了三百。真有这么多就好了…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon bowed his head stiffly, and went. If all the wildlings were like Styr, it would be easier to betray them. The Therms were not like other free folk, though. The Magnar claimed to be the last of the First Men, and ruled with an iron hand. His little land of Therm was a high mountain valley hidden amongst the northernmost peaks of the Frostfangs, surrounded by cave dwellers, Hornfoot men, giants, and the cannibal clans of the ice rivers. Ygritte said the Therms were savage fighters, and that their Magnar was a god to them. Jon could believe that. Unlike Jarl and Harma and Rattleshirt, Styr commanded absolute obedience from his men, and that discipline was no doubt part of why Mance had chosen him to go over the Wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩僵硬地一低头，转身离开。若野人都像斯迪这样，那就好办了。瑟恩族跟其他自由民不同，他们自称为先民末裔，由马格拿实行铁腕统治。斯迪的领地狭窄，只是高山中的峡谷，隐于霜雪之牙极北处，周围有穴居人、硬足民、巨人及大冰川的食人部落。据耶哥蕊特说，瑟恩人是凶猛的战士，而马格拿对他们而言就等于神——这点琼恩毫不怀疑，与贾尔、哈玛或叮当衫的小队不同，斯迪的部下对他绝对服从，无疑这种钢铁纪律正是曼斯选择让他突击长城的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Crow," the Magnar warned, "do not take me for Mance Rayder. If you lie to me, I will have your tongue."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon had to crawl a dozen paces before the cave opened up around him. When he stood again, it took his eyes a moment to adjust. Ygritte had brought a torch, but there was no other light. She stood beside a little waterfall that fell from a cleft in the rock down into a wide dark pool. The orange and yellow flames shone against the pale green water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩不得不爬了十几步，方才到达开阔的空间。等到再次站起，眼睛过了好一阵才适应。洞里只有耶哥蕊特带来的火炬，没有其他光源。她站在一个小瀑布边，水从岩石间的瑕隙流下来，注入宽阔的黑池子。橙色与黄色的火光在淡绿的水面上跳跃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked past the Thenns, sitting atop their rounded bronze helms about their cookfires. Where did Ygrette get herself to? He found her gear and his together, but no sign of the girl herself. "She took a torch and went off that way," Grigg the Goat told him, pointing toward the back of the cavern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走过瑟恩人群，他们围在篝火旁，坐在各人的青铜圆盔上。耶哥蕊特跑哪儿去了？他发现她的行李跟自己的放在一起，但女孩本人不见踪影。“她拿支火炬往那边去了，”山羊格里格边说，边指指山洞后方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon followed his finger, and found himself in a dim back room wandering through a maze of columns and stalactites. She can't be here, he was thinking, when he heard her laugh. He turned toward the sound but within ten paces he was in a dead end, facing a blank wall of rose and white flowstone. Baffled, he made his way back the way he'd come, and then he saw it: a dark hole under an outthrust of wet stone. He knelt, listened, heard the faint sound of water. "Ygritte?"</div>

Only Gendel did not know the caves as Gorne had, and took a wrong turn." She swept the torch back and forth, so the shadows jumped and moved. "Deeper he went, and deeper, and when he tried t' turn back the ways that seemed familiar ended in stone rather than sky. Soon his torches began t' fail, one by one, till finally there was naught but dark.

<div class="line_en">"I know I want you," he heard himself say, all his vows and all his honor forgotten. She stood before him naked as her name day, and he was as hard as the rock around them. He had been in her half a hundred times by now, but always beneath the furs, with others all around them. He had never seen how beautiful she was. Her legs were skinny but well muscled, the hair at the juncture of her thighs a brighter red than that on her head. Does that make it even luckier? He pulled her close. "I love the smell of you," he said. "I love your red hair. I love your mouth, and the way you kiss me. I love your smile. I love your teats." He kissed them, one and then the other. "I love your skinny legs, and what's between them." He knelt to kiss her there, lightly on her mound at first, but Ygritte moved her legs apart a little, and he saw the pink inside and kissed that as well, and tasted her. She gave a little gasp. "If you love me all so much, why are you still dressed?" she whispered. "You know nothing, Jon Snow. Noth -- oh. Oh. OHHH."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, you did. You jumped down the mountain and killed Orell, and afore I could get my axe you had a knife at my throat. I thought you'd have me then, or kill me, or maybe both, but you never did. And when I told you the tale o' Bael the Bard and how he plucked the rose o' Winterfell, I thought you'd know to pluck me then for certain, but you didn't. You know nothing, Jon Snow." She gave him a shy smile. "You might be learning some, though."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你当然偷了我。你从山上跳下来，杀死欧瑞尔，我还没来得及拿起长柄斧，就被短刀抵在咽喉。我以为你会要我，或者杀我，或者两样都干，但你什么也没做。我告诉你吟游诗人贝尔的故事，告诉你他怎样从临冬城摘走冬雪玫瑰，以为你一定会懂，一定会来摘走我，但你没有。你什么都不懂，琼恩·雪诺。”她朝他腼腆地微笑。“但你也许正在学。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is the crow afeared o' Gendel's children?" she said, with a grin. "It's only a little way up, and I'm not done with you, Jon Snow." She pushed him back down on the clothes and straddled him. "Would you…" She hesitated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乌鸦这么害怕詹德尔的子孙吗？”她咧嘴笑道，“上去的路很短，而我跟你还没完呢，琼恩·雪诺。”她又将他推倒在衣服堆里，跨骑上去。“你能不能…”她犹豫地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The light was shifting all about her, Jon noticed suddenly. He looked around. "We had best go up. The torch is almost done."</div>

<div class="line_en">The grotto was pitch-dark by the time they finished. The only light was the dim glow of the passage back up to the larger cavern, where a score of fires burned. They were soon fumbling and bumping into each other as they tried to dress in the dark. Ygritte stumbled into the pool and screeched at the cold of the water. When Jon laughed, she pulled him in too. They wrestled and splashed in the dark, and then she was in his arms again, and it turned out they were not finished after all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完事之后，洞内漆黑一片。只有通往上面大山洞的通道传来一点暗淡的光，大山洞里有二十来堆火在燃烧。他们试图在黑暗中摸索着穿衣服，结果马上互相磕碰起来。耶哥蕊特跌进池子里，冰冷的水令她尖声喊叫。当琼恩哈哈大笑，她将他也拉了下来。他们在黑暗中扭打，溅起水花，然后她又到他的双臂之中，原来他们还没有结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
