<div class="line_en">But next morning Kitty rose early and leaving a note for Dorothy to say that she was gone out on business took a tram down the hill. She made her way through the crowded streets with their motor cars, rickshaws, and chairs, and the motley throng of Europeans and Chinese, to the offices of the P. amp; O. Company. A ship was sailing in two days, the first ship out of the port, and she had made up her mind that at all costs she must go on it. When the clerk told her that every berth was booked she asked to see the chief agent. She sent in her name and the agent, whom she had met before, came out to fetch her into his office. He knew her circumstances and when she told him what she wished he sent for the passenger list. He looked at it with perplexity.</div>

<div class="line_en">She thanked him. She left him with an elated heart. Flight: that was her only thought. Flight! She sent a cable to her father to announce her immediate return; she had already cabled to him to say that Walter was dead; and then went back again to the Townsends to tell Dorothy what she had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她谢过了他，便带着满意的心情离开了。真巴不得飞回去，这是她此时唯一的想法。真巴不得飞回去！她给父亲发了一封电报，通知他们她的归期，此前她已经把瓦尔特去世的消息用电报告诉了他们。她回到了唐生家的寓所，把刚才的事跟多萝西说了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since her return to Hong Kong Kitty had hesitated from day to day to go to her house. She dreaded entering it again and meeting face to face the recollections with which it was peopled. But now she had no alternative. Townsend had arranged for the sale of the furniture and he had found some one eager to take on the lease, but there were all her clothes and Walter's, for they had taken next to nothing to Mei-Tan-Fu, and there were books, photographs, and various odds and ends. Kitty, indifferent to everything and anxious to cut herself off completely from the past, realized that it would outrage the susceptibilities of the Colony if she allowed these things to go with the rest to an auction-room. They must be packed and sent to her. So after tiffin she prepared to go to the house. Dorothy, eager to give her help, offered to accompany her, but Kitty begged to be allowed to go alone. She agreed that two of Dorothy's boys should come and assist in the packing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到香港以来，凯蒂迟迟不敢到她的房子去。她害怕再走进那扇门，害怕那些熟悉的场景会让她回忆起过去。但是如今她别无选择了。唐生已经给她的家具找到了买主，同时为这所房子找到了一位热心的续租人。但是房子里还留有她和瓦尔特的衣服，去湄潭府的时候他们只带走了一两件，另外还有很多书、照片，和五花八门的小玩意儿。凯蒂巴不得离这些东西远远的，她可不想再跟过去那段日子有任何的瓜葛。不过若是将它们全堆到拍卖会上去，恐怕会激起感时伤怀的殖民地上流社会的愤慨之情，说不定他们会把这些东西都收集起来，运到她家里去。所以午饭刚过，她便打算去一趟她的住所。热心帮忙的多萝西提出跟她一块儿去，但是在凯蒂的再三推辞下，最终同意让多萝西的两个童仆跟去，帮着打点一下东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house had been left in charge of the head boy and he opened the door for Kitty. It was curious to go into her own house as though she were a stranger. It was neat and clean. Everything was in its place, ready for her use, but although the day was warm and sunny there was about the silent rooms a chill and desodolate air. The furniture was stiffly arranged, exactly where it should be, and the vases which should have held flowers were in their places; the book which Kitty had laid face downwards she did not remember when still lay face downwards. It was as though the house had been left empty but a minute before and yet that minute was fraught with eternity so that you could not imagine that ever again that house would echo with talk and resound with laughter. On the piano the open music of a foxtrot seemed to wait to be played, but you had a feeling that if you struck the keys no sound would come. Walter's room was as tidy as when he was there. On the chest of drawers were two large photographs of Kitty, one in her presentation dress and one in her wedding-gown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子一直交给管家照料，凯蒂到来时是他开了门。走进屋子里，凯蒂觉得自己好像是个初次造访的陌生人。屋子里收拾得干净整洁，所有的物件都放在原来的位置，等着她回来后方便取用。天气非常暖和，阳光也很足，可在这些寂静的房间里却飘荡着冰冷、凄凉的气氛。家具还像以前一样呆板地摆放在原处，用来插花的花瓶也似乎没有移动过位置。那本凯蒂不知道什么时候扣在桌上的书也还像原来一样静静地扣着。凯蒂觉得他们好像只离开了一分钟，可是这一分钟却像永恒一样漫长，使人想不到何时房子里才会再次充满欢声笑语。钢琴上摊开的狐步舞曲的乐谱似乎等待着人去演奏，可你却有种感觉，当你按下琴键的时候不会有任何声音传出来。瓦尔特的房间还像他在时那么整洁。柜子上摆着两幅凯蒂的放大照片，一幅是她穿着舞会礼服照的，另一幅是她的婚礼照。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the boys fetched up the trunks from the box-room and she stood over them watching them pack. They packed neatly and quickly. Kitty reflected that in the two days she had it would be easy to get everything done. She must not let herself think; she had no time for that. Suddenly she heard a step behind her and turning round saw Charles Townsend. She felt a sudden chill at her heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩们从储藏室里搬出了行李箱，凯蒂站在一边，看着他们分拣物件。他们动作十分麻利，凯蒂估计走之前的这两天肯定能把所有东西都打理妥当。这段时间她绝不能让自己胡思乱想，她是肯定没那个闲工夫的。忽然，凯蒂听到身后传来了一阵脚步声，回头一看，是查尔斯·唐生。她的心里痉挛了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She said no more, but with a word to the boys to go on with what they were doing, preceded Charles into the next room. She did not sit down, in order to show him that she expected him not to detain her. She knew that she was very pale and her heart was beating fast, but she faced him coolly, with hostile eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没再说话，只叫仆人接着做他们的事，然后领着查尔斯来到了隔壁的房间。她没有找地方坐下，好让他明白有话赶紧说完就走。她知道她的脸色苍白，心跳得很厉害，但还是用冷淡、敌意的眼神直视着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
