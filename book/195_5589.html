<div class="line_en">Athelny told Philip that he could easily get him something to do in the large firm of linendrapers in which himself worked. Several of the assistants had gone to the war, and Lynn and Sedley with patriotic zeal had promised to keep their places open for them. They put the work of the heroes on those who remained, and since they did not increase the wages of these were able at once to exhibit public spirit and effect an economy; but the war continued and trade was less depressed; the holidays were coming, when numbers of the staff went away for a fortnight at a time: they were bound to engage more assistants. Philip's experience had made him doubtful whether even then they would engage him; but Athelny, representing himself as a person of consequence in the firm, insisted that the manager could refuse him nothing. Philip, with his training in Paris, would be very useful; it was only a matter of waiting a little and he was bound to get a well-paid job to design costumes and draw posters. Philip made a poster for the summer sale and Athelny took it away. Two days later he brought it back, saying that the manager admired it very much and regretted with all his heart that there was no vacancy just then in that department. Philip asked whether there was nothing else he could do.</div>

<div class="line_en">Athelny was a little confused; he had led Philip to expect something much more splendid; on the other hand he was too poor to go on providing him indefinitely with board and lodging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿西尔尼被这话问懵了。一开始，是他让菲利普觉得自己能给他找到更上档次的工作，可从另一方面来说，家里就快揭不开锅了，不能一直供着他白吃白住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You might take it while you wait for something better. You always stand a better chance if you're engaged by the firm already."</div>

<div class="line_en">Notwithstanding the war there was evidently much difficulty in finding work, for when Philip went to the shop many men were waiting already. He recognised some whom he had seen in his own searching, and there was one whom he had noticed lying about the park in the afternoon. To Philip now that suggested that he was as homeless as himself and passed the night out of doors. The men were of all sorts, old and young, tall and short; but every one had tried to make himself smart for the interview with the manager: they had carefully brushed hair and scrupulously clean hands. They waited in a passage which Philip learnt afterwards led up to the dining-hall and the work rooms; it was broken every few yards by five or six steps. Though there was electric light in the shop here was only gas, with wire cages over it for protection, and it flared noisily. Philip arrived punctually, but it was nearly ten o'clock when he was admitted into the office. It was three-cornered, like a cut of cheese lying on its side: on the walls were pictures of women in corsets, and two poster-proofs, one of a man in pyjamas, green and white in large stripes, and the other of a ship in full sail ploughing an azure sea: on the sail was printed in large letters `great white sale.' The widest side of the office was the back of one of the shop-windows, which was being dressed at the time, and an assistant went to and fro during the interview. The manager was reading a letter. He was a florid man, with sandy hair and a large sandy moustache; from the middle of his watch-chain hung a bunch of football medals. He sat in his shirt sleeves at a large desk with a telephone by his side; before him were the day's advertisements, Athelny's work, and cuttings from newspapers pasted on a card. He gave Philip a glance but did not speak to him; he dictated a letter to the typist, a girl who sat at a small table in one corner; then he asked Philip his name, age, and what experience he had had. He spoke with a cockney twang in a high, metallic voice which he seemed not able always to control; Philip noticed that his upper teeth were large and protruding; they gave you the impression that they were loose and would come out if you gave them a sharp tug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使正处战乱，工作却依旧不好找。菲利普到店的时候，前面已经有不少等待面试的人了。他认出几个之前见过的难兄难弟，其中一个还是某天下午在公园见到的，当时那人正在草坪上躺着呢。菲利普觉得他一定跟自己一样，都是无家可归、露宿街头的流浪汉。来面试的人形形色色，千奇百怪：有年轻的也有老头子，有大高个儿也有小矮子。每个人都试图在经理面前表现得机灵一点，头发是精心梳理过的，手也洗得干干净净。他们在过道里排队等候。片刻之后，菲利普才知道这条过道是通往商店大厅和办公室的。每走几码就要上五六个台阶。商店里有电灯，可这里只有笼着钢丝尘罩的汽灯在咝咝燃烧。菲利普准时赶来，一直等到十点才正式面试。办公室是间三角形的小屋，像是从一角切下来的奶酪块。墙上贴着穿紧身胸衣女人的照片，还有两幅广告宣传画，一幅画着穿绿白宽条睡裤的男人，另一幅是蔚蓝大海上全速行驶的帆船，帆上印着几个大字“织物大促销”。办公室里最大的一面墙背后就是商店橱窗，正赶着有人来装饰布置，面试店员的时候一个助理在屋里走来走去，忙忙碌碌。经理正在读一封信。他看上去气色很好，留着浅黄色的头发和同样颜色的大胡子。他的怀表链子上挂了一大串足球奖章。他坐在一张大桌旁，没有穿外套，手边摆了台电话，前面堆着商场近日要发出的广告单、阿西尔尼的稿件和贴在卡片上的新闻剪报。他看了菲利普一眼，没有说话。他正给打字员读信。打字员是个女孩，坐在角落的小桌子旁。信打好了，他才开始面试菲利普，问了他的姓名、年龄和之前的工作经验。他说话带着伦敦腔，鼻音很浓，非常有磁性，稍微控制不住，嗓门就高了八度。菲利普发现他上牙长得特别大，还向外凸着，好像已经松动了，使劲一拔就能拔出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

If you suit, one of these days you may find yourself in a position like what mine is. Bear that in mind, young feller."</div>
