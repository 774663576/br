<div class="line_en">In a chair on the terrace an old gentleman was sitting and the sight of him 'Was vaguely familiar to Dr. Armstrong. Where had he seen that frog -- like face, that tortoise-like neck, that hunched up attitudeyes, and those pale shrewd little eyes? Of course -- old Wargrave. He'd given evidence once before him. Always looked half asleep, but was shrewd as could be when it came to a point of law. Had great power with a jury -- it was said he could make their minds up for them any day of the week. He'd got one or two unlikely convictions out of them. A hanging judge, some people said.</div>
