<div class="line_en">Mom was folding my laundry while watching this TV show called The View when I got home. I told her that the tulips and the Dutch artist and everything were all because Augustus was using his Wish to take me to Amsterdam. "That's too much," she said, shaking her head. "We can't accept that from a virtual stranger."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Maria said I couldn't go to Amsterdam without an adult intimately familiar with my case, which more or less meant either Mom or Dr. Maria herself.

<div class="line_en">Mom laughed. Finally, she started to get excited, typing tasks into her phone: She'd have to call Gus's parents and talk to the Genies about my medical needs and do they have a hotel yet and what are the best guidebooks and we should do our research if we only have three days, and so on. I kind of had a headache, so I downed a couple Advil and decided to take a nap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈大笑起来。终于，她也开始热血沸腾，把要做的事一项一项输入手机：她得给格斯的父母打电话，和灯神谈谈我医药方面的需要，问他们订好酒店了没有，还有哪些导游书最好，如果只有三天我们应当事先做功课，诸如此类。我有点儿头疼了，于是吞下几片镇痛药，决定去小睡一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you kidding? You don't think Dad would enjoy a few days of watching TV shows that are not about aspiring models and ordering pizza every night, using paper towels as plates so he doesn't have to do the dishes?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你开玩笑吗？你不觉得爸爸能享受几天自在日子会很高兴吗？他终于可以看点儿跟胸怀大志的模特无关的电视，可以每天晚上叫比萨外卖，用厨房纸巾当盘子，逃避刷碗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I ended up just lying in bed and replaying the whole picnic with Augustus. I couldn't stop thinking about the little moment when I'd tensed up as he touched me. The gentle familiarity felt wrong, somehow. I thought maybe it was how orchestrated the whole thing had been: Augustus was amazing, but he'd overdone everything at the picnic, right down to the sandwiches that were metaphorically resonant but tasted terrible and the memorized soliloquy that prevented conversation. It all felt Romantic, but not romantic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但结果我只是躺在床上，脑子里从头到尾反复重播跟奥古斯塔斯一起野餐的情景，忍不住地想着他碰到我的时候我全身紧张的那一刻。不知为什么，那种温柔的亲近之举感觉不太对劲。我想也许是因为整件事都策划得过于精心，当然奥古斯塔斯好得没话说，但野餐时的一切他都做得有点儿过火，比如那些带着隐喻却很难吃的三明治，还有不许人插嘴的独白朗诵。这些给人的感觉是浪漫主义，却不浪漫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But then again, he hadn't tried to kiss me; he'd only touched my face, which is not even sexual. It was not a move designed to elicit arousal, but it was certainly a designed move, because Augustus Waters was no improviser. So what had he been trying to convey? And why hadn't I wanted to accept it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过话说回来，他并没有吻我的意思。他只是摸了摸我的脸，这甚至没有任何性意味。算不上是调情之举，但肯定是事先设计好的，因为奥古斯塔斯·沃特斯不擅长临场发挥。那么，他到底想要表达什么意思？而我又为什么本能地抗拒接受？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the truth is that I had never wanted him to kiss me, not in the way you are supposed to want these things. I mean, he was gorgeous. I was attracted to him. I thought about him in that way, to borrow a phrase from the middle school vernacular. But the actual touch, the realized touch… it was all wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但事实是，我从来没有期待过他会吻我，还没到水到渠成渴望这种事发生的时候。我得说，的确，他英俊迷人，我为他心动。借用中学里的一句俗话：我对他“有感觉”。但真正的接触，现实中的碰触……完全不对头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I found myself worrying I would have to make out with him to get to Amsterdam, which is not the kind of thing you want to be thinking, because (a) It shouldn't've even been a question whether I wanted to kiss him, and (b) Kissing someone so that you can get a free trip is perilously close to full-on hooking, and I have to confess that while I did not fancy myself a particularly good person, I never thought my first real sexual action would be prostitutional.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，我发现自己在担心会不会因为要去阿姆斯特丹而不得不跟他亲热，这可不是什么令人欢欣鼓舞的事，因为（a）首先，我想不想吻他根本就不应该成为一个问题，（b）为了免费旅游而吻某个人非常危险，几乎等同于十足的卖身，而我必须承认，尽管我没把自己设想成格外正直的好人，但也绝没想过我第一次真正的性行为可能是妓女式的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“快说来听听。”凯特琳答道。我一五一十地全告诉了她，包括令人尴尬的摸脸事件，只保留了阿姆斯特丹之行和奥古斯塔斯的名字没讲。“你确定他够帅？”我说完后她问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I pulled out my laptop and looked up Caroline Mathers. The physical similarities were striking: same steroidally round face, same nose, same approximate overall body shape.

<div class="line_cn" title="我打开笔记本电脑，上网查找卡罗琳·玛瑟斯。她与我外貌上的相似殊可惊人：一样由类固醇造成的圆脸蛋，一样的鼻子，一样的大致体形。但她的眼睛是深褐色的（我的眼睛是绿色的），她的肤色也更深些——可能是意大利裔什么的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thousands of people -- literally thousands -- had left condolence messages for her. It was an endless scroll of people who missed her, so many that it took me an hour of clicking to get past the I'm sorry you're dead wall posts to the I'm praying for you wall posts. She'd died a year ago of brain cancer. I was able to click through to some of her pictures. Augustus was in a bunch of the earlier ones: pointing with a thumbs-up to the jagged scar across her bald skull; arm in arm at Memorial Hospital's playground, with their backs facing the camera; kissing while Caroline held the camera out, so you could only see their noses and closed eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">I kept thinking about my shoulder, which hurt, and also I still had the headache, but maybe only because I'd been thinking about a girl who'd died of brain cancer. I kept telling myself to compartmentalize, to be here now at the circular table (arguably too large in diameter for three people and definitely too large for two) with this soggy broccoli and a black-bean burger that all the ketchup in the world could not adequately moisten. I told myself that imagining a met in my brain or my shoulder would not affect the invisible reality going on inside of me, and that therefore all such thoughts were wasted moments in a life composed of a definitionally finite set of such moments. I even tried to tell myself to live my best life today.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe I was supposed to hate Caroline Mathers or something because she'd been with Augustus, but I didn't. I couldn't see her very clearly amid all the tributes, but there didn't seem to be much to hate -- she seemed to be mostly a professional sick person, like me, which made me worry that when I died they'd have nothing to say about me except that I fought heroically, as if the only thing I'd ever done was Have Cancer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许我应该对卡罗琳·玛瑟斯心怀嫉妒什么的，因为她曾和奥古斯塔斯相恋。但我没有。在那些浩如烟海的纪念辞中，我看不太清楚她，但她身上似乎没什么好嫉妒的——她似乎就是一个全职病人，跟我一样。这让我不禁担心我死的时候，他们是不是也没什么可说的，只能说我英勇地与疾病战斗过，仿佛我这一辈子只做过一件事，就是得癌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I turned on my computer to listen to some music, and with Augustus's favorite band, The Hectic Glow, as my sound track, I went back to Caroline Mathers's tribute pages, reading about how heroic her fight was, and how much she was missed, and how she was in a better place, and how she would live forever in their memories, and how everyone who knew her -- everyone -- was laid low by her leaving.</div>

<div class="line_en">So it was all like, Caroline continues to have behavioral problems. She's struggling a lot with anger and frustration over not being able to speak (we are frustrated about these things, too, of course, but we have more socially acceptable ways of dealing with our anger). Gus has taken to calling Caroline HULK SMASH, which resonates with the doctors. There's nothing easy about this for any of us, but you take your humor where you can get it. Hoping to go home on Thursday. We'll let you know…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些记录大都如下：“卡罗琳仍然有严重的行为问题。因为无法说话而产生的愤怒和挫败令她挣扎得很艰难（当然，这些事情让我们也倍感挫败，但我们有更合乎社会规范的应对愤怒的方式）。格斯近来喜欢管卡罗琳叫‘绿巨人①出击’，医生们也热情响应。对我们任何一个人来说，这都不是轻松的事，但能幽默的时候幽上一默总不坏。希望周四能回家。我们会继续向大家汇报……”">查看中文翻译</div>
