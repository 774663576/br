<div class="line_en">Ye felt weak. She fell back to sleep. As she dozed, the roar kept her company. Before long, she woke again. Now the numbness had disappeared and the pain reasserted itself: Her head and the joints of her limbs ached, and the breath coming out of her mouth felt scalding hot. Her throat hurt so much that swallowing spittle felt like it was a piece of burning coal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye Wenjie heard a loud, continuous roar. She didn't know how much time had passed. The noise came from all around her. In her vague state of consciousness, it seemed as though some gigantic machine was drilling into or sawing through the block of ice that held her. The world was still only darkness, but the noise grew more and more real. Finally, she was certain that the source of the noise was neither heaven nor hell, and she remained in the land of the living. She realized that her eyes were still closed. With an effort, she lifted her eyelids. The first thing she saw was a light embedded deeply in the ceiling. Covered by a wire mesh that seemed designed to protect it, it emitted a dim glow. The ceiling appeared to be made of metal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知过了多长时间，叶文洁听到了沉重的轰鸣声。这声音来自所有的方向，在她那模糊的意识中，似乎有某种巨大的机械在钻开或锯开她置身于其中的大冰块。世界仍是一片黑暗，但轰鸣声却变得越来越真实，她终于能够确定这声音的来源既不是天堂也不是地狱。她意识到自己仍闭着眼睛，便努力地睁开沉重的眼皮——首先看到了一盏灯，灯深嵌在天花板内部，被罩在一层似乎是用于防撞击的铁丝网后面，发出昏暗的光，天花板似乎是金属的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You're Yang Weining? Ye didn't say anything, but she was stunned. She saw that he kept his expression calm, apparently not wishing to let anyone else know that they knew each other. Yang had been one of Ye Zhetai's graduate students. By the time he had obtained his degree, Wenjie was still a first-year in college. She could clearly remember the first time Yang came to her home. He had just begun his graduate studies and needed to discuss the direction of his research with Professor Ye. Yang said that he wanted to focus on experimental and applied problems, staying away from theory.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yang was very talented, with a good mathematical foundation and a quick mind. But during his brief time as a graduate student, he always kept a respectable distance from his thesis advisor. Ye Wenjie had seen Yang several times, but, perhaps due to the influence of her father, she hadn't noticed him much. As for whether he had paid much attention to her, she had no idea. After Yang got his degree, he soon ceased all contact with her father.</div>

You know very well that the security clearance needed for this project requires someone willing to join the army. But the bigger issue is the requirement in the security regulations that they be sequestered at the base for extended periods. What's to be done if they have families? Sequester them at the base too? No one would agree to that. I did find two possible candidates, but both would rather stay at the May Seventh Cadre Schools rather than come here Of course we could forcefully move them.

<div class="line_en">By the time they landed, it was dusk. Ye refused to be helped by Yang and Lei, and struggled out of the helicopter by herself. A strong gust of wind almost blew her over. The still-gyrating rotors sliced through the wind, making a loud whistling noise. The scent of the woods on the wind was familiar to her, and she was familiar to the wind. It was the wind of the Greater Khingan Mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="降落时已是傍晚，叶文洁谢绝了杨卫宁和雷志成的挽扶，自己艰难地走下飞机，一阵强风差点把她吹倒，风吹在仍转动的旋翼上，发出尖利的啸声。风中的森林气息文洁很熟悉，她认识这风，这风也认识她，这是大兴安岭的风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She soon heard another sound, a kind of low, forceful, bass howl that seemed to form the background of the world: the parabolic antenna dish in the wind. Only now, when she was so close to it, did she finally feel its immensity. Ye's life had made a big circle this month: She was now on top of Radar Peak. She couldn't help but look in the direction of her Construction Corps company. But all she could see was a misty sea of trees in the twilight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很快听到了另一种声音，一个低沉浑厚的嗡嗡声，浑厚而有力，似乎构成了整个世界的背景，这是不远处抛物面天线在风中的声音，只有到了跟前，才能真正感受到这张天网的巨大。叶文洁的人生在这一个月里转了一个大圈又回来了——她现在是在雷达峰上。叶文洁不由得转头朝她的建设兵团连队所在的方向望去，只看到暮色中一片迷蒙的林海。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The helicopter was carrying more than just Ye. Several soldiers came over and began to unload military-green cargo trunks from the cabin. They walked by without glancing at her. As she followed Yang and Lei, Ye noticed that the top of Radar Peak was spacious. A cluster of white buildings, like delicate toy blocks, nestled under the giant antenna. The trio headed toward the base gate, flanked by two guards, and stopped in front of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直升机显然不是专为接她的，几名士兵走过来，从机舱里卸下那些军绿色的货箱，他们从她身边走过，没人看她一眼。她和雷志成、杨卫宁一行三人继续向前走去，叶文洁发现雷达峰的峰顶是这样的宽阔，在天线的下面有一小群白色建筑物，与天线相比，它们像几块精致的积木。他们正朝有两名哨兵站岗的基地大门走去，走到门前，他们停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yang waited until the others were gone and indicated that Ye should follow him a little distance away from the gate, clearly trying to avoid the sentries listening in. He no longer pretended that he didn't know her. "Wenjie, let me be clear. This is not some great opportunity. I learned from the military control commission at the court that although Cheng Lihua advocates sentencing you severely, the most that you'll get is ten years. Considering mitigating circumstances, you'll serve maybe six or seven years. But here"-- he nodded in the direction of the base --"is a research project under the highest security classification. Given your status, if you enter the gate, it's possible --" He paused, as though wanting to let the bass howl of the antenna add to the weight of his words. "-- you'll never leave for the rest of your life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杨卫宁等别人走远了，向叶文洁示意了一一下，带她走远些，显然是怕哨兵听到下面的谈话。这时，他不再隐藏自己与她的相识：“叶文洁，我可向你说清楚，这不是什么机会。我向法院军管会了解过，虽然程丽华力主重判，但具体到你的情节，刑期最多也就是十年，考虑到可能的减刑，也就是六七年的样子。而这里——”他向基地方向偏了一下头， “是最高密级的研究项目，以你的身份，走进这道门，可能……”他停了好一会儿，似乎想让天线在风中的轰鸣声加重自己的语气，“一辈子都出不来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lei turned to her and spoke solemnly. "Ye Wenjie, the evidence of your counter-revolutionary crime is incontrovertible, and the court would have punished you as you deserve. But now you have an opportunity to redeem yourself through hard work. You can accept it or refuse it." He pointed at the antenna. "This is a defense research facility. The research conducted here needs your specialized scientific knowledge. Chief Engineer Yang can give you the details, which you should consider carefully." He nodded at Yang and then entered the gate after the soldiers carrying the trunks.</div>

Other than the undiscovered country beyond death from which no one has ever returned, the place she wanted to be the most was this peak, separated from the rest of the world. Here, she felt a sense of security that had long eluded her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不回去，我们进去吧。”叶文洁的声音仍很轻，但其中有一种斩钉截铁的坚定。现在除了死后不知是否存在的另一个世界，她最想去的地方就是这样与世隔绝的峰顶了，在这里，她有一种久违的安全感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yang lowered his head and said nothing. He stared into the distance, as though forcing Ye to sort through her thoughts. Ye stayed silent as well. She pulled her coat tightly around herself and gazed into the distance. There, the Greater Khingan Mountains were fading into the darkening night.

<div class="line_en">"All right." Yang glanced at the guard at the desk, who paid no attention to them. He seemed to understand Ye's concern and brought her back out of the main control room. "Stand somewhere out of the wind, and I'll be back in a few minutes. I just need to get someone to start a fire in your room -- conditions at the base are a bit rough, and we have no heating system."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye felt a light itch on her face. She knew that an enormous electric field had appeared. She lifted her face and gazed in the direction the antenna was pointing and saw a cloud in the night sky glow with a dim blue light, so dim that at first she thought it an illusion. But as the cloud drifted away, the glow disappeared. Another cloud that drifted into position began to give off the same glow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye heard a fluttering noise. Through the mist, she could see shadows lift out of the woods below the peak and spiral into the dark sky. She hadn't realized so many birds could be roused from the woods in deep winter. Then she saw a terrifying scene: One flock of birds flew into the region of air the antenna pointed at, and against the background of the faintly glowing cloud, the birds dropped out of the sky.</div>

She stared at the antenna and thought it looked like an enormous hand stretched open toward the sky, possessing an ethereal strength. As she surveyed the night sky, she did not see any target that she thought might be serial number BN20197F. Beyond the wisps of clouds, all she could see were the stars of a cold night in 1969.</div>
