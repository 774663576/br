<div class="line_en">Through a cleft in those mountains which Jill had seen far inland as she approached the land, the sunset light was pouring over a level lawn. On the far side of the lawn, its weather-vanes glittering in the light, rose a many-towered and many-turreted castle; the most beautiful castle Jill had ever seen. On the near side was a quay of white marble and, moored to this, the ship: a tall ship with high forecastle and high poop, gilded and crimson, with a great flag at the mast-head, and many banners waving from the decks, and a row of shields, bright as silver, along the bulwarks. The gang-plank was laid to her, and at the foot of it, just ready to go on board, stood an old, old man. He wore a rich mantle of scarlet which opened in front to show his silver mail shirt. There was a thin circlet of gold on his head. His beard, white as wool, fell nearly to his waist. He stood straight enough, leaning one hand on the shoulder of a richly dressed lord who seemed younger than himself: but you could see he was very old and frail. He looked as if a puff of wind could blow him away, and his eyes were watery.</div>

<div class="line_en">Immediately in front of the King -- who had turned round to speak to his people before going on board the ship -- there was a little chair on wheels, and, harnessed to it, a little donkey: not much bigger than a big retriever. In this chair sat a fat little dwarf. He was as richly dressed as the King, but because of his fatness and because he was sitting hunched up among cushions, the effect was quite different: it made him look like a shapeless little bundle of fur and silk and velvet. He was as old as the King, but more hale and hearty, with very keen eyes. His bare head, which was bald and extremely large, shone like a gigantic billiard ball in the sunset light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王这时趁着还没上船，转身向他的百姓讲话——紧挨着国王前面是一只小小的轮椅，前面套着一匹小小的驴子，比一只大猎狗大不了多少的驴子。这把椅子上坐着一个胖胖的小矮人，他的衣服和国王一样华贵，但因为他是胖子，又弓起身子坐在软垫堆上，结果看上去竟大不一样，他看上去就像乱糟糟一小堆毛皮、丝绸和丝绒。小矮人和国王一样老，但更健壮，目光锐利。他没戴帽子，脑袋都秃了，而且其大无比，在夕阳下就像一颗特大台球似的发亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Farther back, in a half-circle, stood what Jill at once knew to be the courtiers. They were well worth looking at for their clothes and armour alone. As far as that went, they looked more like a flower-bed than a crowd. But what really made Jill open her eyes and mouth as wide as they would go, was the people themselves. If "people" was the right word. For only about one in every five was human. The rest were things you never see in our world. Fauns, satyrs, centaurs: Jill could give a name to these, for she had seen pictures of them. Dwarfs too. And there were a lot of animals she knew as well; bears, badgers, moles, leopards, mice, and various birds. But then they were so very different from the animals which one called by the same names in England. Some of them were much bigger -- the mice, for instance, stood on their hind legs and were over two feet high. But quite apart from that, they all looked different. You could see by the expression in their faces that they could talk and think just as well as you could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再往后，一溜儿站成半园形的，吉尔一看就知道是大臣们。如果光看他们的衣服和盔甲，那倒是值得一看的。实际上他们看上去更像一个花坛，而不像一群人。但真正使吉尔自瞪口呆的是那些百姓。就是说，如果用”百姓”这个字眼合适的话。因为其中只有五分之一是人类。其他都是你在我们的世界里从来没见过的。有羊怪、树精、人头马，吉尔叫得出这些名字，因为她看见过这些怪物的图画。还有小矮人。还有很多动物她也认识有熊、灌、睡鼠、豹、老鼠以及各种鸟儿。不过这些动物比起英国的同类动物可大不相同。好多动物都大得多——比方说老鼠吧，它们用后腿站着，就不止两英尺高。而除了这点以外，它们看上去全都不一样。你从它们脸上的表情就看得出，它们能说话，也能想，就像你能说能想一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The King was speaking to the Dwarf, but Jill couldn't hear what he said. And, as far as she could make out, the Dwarf made no answer, though he nodded and wagged his head a great deal. Then the King raised his voice and addressed the whole court: but his voice was so old and cracked that she could understand very little of his speech -- especially since it was all about people and places she had never heard of. When the speech was over, the King stooped down and kissed the Dwarf on both cheeks, straightened himself, raised his right hand as if in blessing, and went, slowly and with feeble steps, up the gangway and on board the ship. The courtiers appeared to be greatly moved by his departure. Handkerchiefs were got out, sounds of sobbing were heard in every direction. The gangway was cast off, trumpets sounded from the poop, and the ship moved away from the quay. (It was being towed by a rowing-boat, but Jill didn't see that.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王正在跟那个小矮人说话，但吉尔听不出他在说什么。她只弄明白那小矮人虽然一个劲儿地点头或摇头，却没回答国王的话。接着国王扯开嗓门对全场的人讲话，但他的声音苍老嘶哑，她听得懂的话实在太少了——尤其是这番话全都是关于她从来没听见过的百姓和地方的。讲完以后，国王弯下腰吻了小矮人两颊，再站直身子，举起右手，似乎是在祝福，然后拖着有气无力的步子慢慢地走上跳板，上了船。那些大臣似乎都为他的起程深受感动。好多人拿出了手帕，四面八方都是哭声。跳板撤掉了，船尾楼响起了喇叭声，船离开了码头。（船是由一条划艇拖走的，不过吉尔没看见那划艇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Caspian the Tenth," said the Owl. And Jill wondered why Scrubb had suddenly pulled up short in his walk and turned an extraordinary colour. She thought she had never seen him look so sick about anything. But before she had time to ask any questions they had reached the dwarf, who was just gathering up the reins of his donkey and preparing to drive back to the castle. The crowd of courtiers had broken up and were going in the same direction, by ones and twos and little knots, like people coming away from watching a game or a race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯斯宾十世。”猫头鹰说。吉尔不知斯克罗布走着走着干吗突然停下，脸色也异常了。她心想自己还从来没见过他看上去对任何事那么难过呢。但她还来不及问什么，他们就已经走到小矮人身边，他正好收起驴子的缰绳，准备驾车回城堡去。那群大臣也散开了，三五成群，往同一个方向走去，就像人们看完运动会或比赛散场一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With help from the children, and in spite of a fit of coughing on the part of the Dwarf, Glimfeather explained that the strangers had been sent by Aslan to visit the court of Narnia. The Dwarf glanced quickly up at them with a new expression in his eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, my dears," he said, taking first one and then the other by the hand and bowing his head a little. "You are very heartily welcome. If the good King, my poor Master, had not this very hour set sail for Seven Isles, he would have been glad of your coming. It would have brought back his youth to him for a moment -- for a moment. And now, it is high time for supper. You shall tell me your business in full council tomorrow morning.

<div class="line_en">Here the Dwarf put his mouth close to the Owl's head and, no doubt, intended to whisper: but, like other deaf people, he wasn't a very good judge of his own voice, and both children heard him say, "See that they're properly washed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这儿，小矮人嘴巴凑到猫头鹰脑袋旁边，毫无疑问，他是打算悄悄说话的但正像其他聋子一样，他对自己的声音估计不足，两个孩子都听见他说”务必让他们好好洗洗干净。”：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went across the lawn and then through an orchard and so to the North Gate of Cair Paravel, which stood wide open. Inside, they found a grassy courtyard. Lights were already showing from the windows of the great hall on their right and from a more complicated mass of buildings straight ahead. Into these the Owl led them, and there a most delightful person was called to look after Jill. She was not much taller than Jill herself, and a good deal slenderer, but obviously full grown, graceful as a willow, and her hair was willowy too, and there seemed to be moss in it. She brought Jill to a round room in one of the turrets, where there was a little bath sunk in the floor and a fire of sweet-smelling woods burning on the flat hearth and a lamp hanging by a silver chain from the vaulted roof. The window looked west into the strange land of Narnia, and Jill saw the red remains of the sunset still glowing behind distant mountains. It made her long for more adventures and feel sure that this was only the beginning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们穿过草地，接着穿过果园，来到凯尔帕拉维尔的北门，大门敞开着。里面是一个长满青草的院子，在他们右面的大厅窗户里已经透出了灯光，正前方一大片更复杂的楼房里也有灯光。猫头鹰领他们走了进去。在那儿叫了一个很讨人喜欢的人来照顾吉尔。她跟吉尔个子差不多，却苗条得多，而且显然是个成人，她像杨柳一样文雅，头发也像杨柳，里面好像还有青苔呢。她把吉尔带到一座塔楼上的一间圆形的房间，那里地面上嵌着一只小浴缸，壁炉里生着火，木柴香气扑鼻，拱形屋顶垂下一条银链吊着一盏灯。从朝西的窗户里可以看见纳尼亚陌生的国土，吉尔看见落日的余辉仍然在远处的群山后发着红光。这使她渴望更多的奇遇，而且确信这还只是个开头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that, the Dwarf touched up his donkey and it set off towards the castle at something between a trot and a waddle (it was a very fat little beast), while the Faun, the Owl, and the children followed at a rather slower pace. The sun had set and the air was growing cool.</div>

<div class="line_en">Supper in the great hall of the castle was the most splendid thing either of them had ever seen; for though Eustace had been in that world before, he had spent his whole visit at sea and knew nothing of the glory and courtesy of the Narnians at home in their own land. The banners hung from the roof, and each course came in with trumpeters and kettledrums. There were soups that would make your mouth water to think of, and the lovely fishes called pavenders, and venison and peacock and pies, and ices and jellies and fruit and nuts, and all manner of wines and fruit drinks. Even Eustace cheered up and admitted that it was "something like". And when all the serious eating and drinking was over, a blind poet came forward and struck up the grand old tale of Prince Cor and Aravis and the horse Bree, which is called The Horse and his Boy and tells of an adventure that happened in Narnia and Calormen and the lands between, in the Golden Age when Peter was High King in Cair Paravel.
