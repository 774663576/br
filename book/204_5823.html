<div class="line_en">And do you know what? Well, granted that it was only a dream, yet the sensation of the love of those innocent and beautiful people has remained with me for ever, and I feel as though their love is still flowing out to me from over there. I have seen them myself, have known them and been convinced; I loved them, I suffered for them afterwards.</div>

<div class="line_en">They desired nothing and were at peace; they did not aspire to knowledge of life as we aspire to understand it, because their lives were full. But their knowledge was higher and deeper than ours; for our science seeks to explain what life is, aspires to understand it in order to teach others how to love, while they without science knew how to live; and that I understood, but I could not understand their knowledge. They showed me their trees, and I could not understand the intense love with which they looked at them; it was as though they were talking with creatures like themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们与世无争，淡泊名利，他们不像我们那样竭力去寻求生活，因为他们生活得很充实。可是，他们的知识要比我们的高深得多，因为我们的知识力图说明生活是什么，力图去认识生活，以便去教会别人生活；他们呢，他们不学科学就懂得该如何生活。这一点我明白，但我不懂得他们的知识。他们指点我观赏他们的树木，我却不能体会他们欣赏树木时的那份情素：他们仿佛同类相通，心心相印。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oh, I understood at once even at the time that in many things I could not understand them at all; as an up-to-date Russian progressive and contemptible Petersburger, it struck me as inexplicable that, knowing so much, they had, for instance, no science like our. But I soon realised that their knowledge was gained and fostered by intuitions different from those of us on earth, and that their aspirations, too, were quite different.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，甚至在当时我马上就明白过来，在很多方面我并不完全了解他们；我作为俄国当代进步人士及卑微的彼得堡人似乎没有解决这个问题，即他们没有受过我们那样的教育却懂得那么多的事情。不过，我很快就明白了，他们知识的充实与吸收，用的是另一种与我们地球上不同的方法，而且他们的追求也完全不同。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And perhaps I shall not be mistaken if I say that they conversed with them. Yes, they had found their language, and I am convinced that the trees understood them. They looked at all Nature like that -- at the animals who lived in peace with them and did not attack them, but loved them, conquered by their love. They pointed to the stars and told me something about them which I could not understand, but I am convinced that they were somehow in touch with the stars, not only in thought, but by some living channel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="您可知道，如果我说他们能同树木交谈，大概我没有说错吧！是的，他们找到了树木的语言，我也确信，树木也懂他们的话语。他们就是这样看待整个大自然包括动物的。动物同他们和平相处，不向他们发起进攻，而且喜欢他们，为他们的爱心所驯服。他们指引我观看星星，并同我谈星星的事儿，我听不明白，但我相信，他们像是有某种方法同天上的星辰进行交往，不只是思想上的，而是有一种生动活泼的途径。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oh, these people did not persist in trying to make me understand them, they loved me without that, but I knew that they would never understand me, and so I hardly spoke to them about our earth. I only kissed in their presence the earth on which they lived and mutely worshipped them themselves. And they saw that and let me worship them without being abashed at my adoration, for they themselves loved much. They were not unhappy on my account when at times I kissed their feet with tears, joyfully conscious of the love with which they would respond to mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，这些人没有强求我了解他们，我不了解，他们也还是爱我，但是我知道，他们永远也无法理解我的，因此，我几乎不跟他们谈我们地球上的事。在他们面前我只是频频亲吻他们生息的土地，以表达对他们无言的崇敬。他们见了，任凭我去表示，不因我的崇敬而羞愧，因为他们自己也很尊崇。我有时满脸泪痕地去吻他们的脚，他们没有因为我而难过，当我知道他们将用多么炽热的爱来回报我时，我心头有多兴奋！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The work they did for food and raiment was brief and not labourious. They loved and begot children, but I never noticed in them the impulse of that cruel sensuality which overcomes almost every man on this earth, all and each, and is the source of almost every sin of mankind on earth. They rejoiced at the arrival of children as new beings to share their happiness. There was no quarrelling, no jealousy among them, and they did not even know what the words meant. Their children were the children of all, for they all made up one family. There was scarcely any illness among them, though there was death; but their old people died peacefully, as though falling asleep, giving blessings and smiles to those who surrounded them to take their last farewell with bright and lovely smiles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们只需从事轻微的劳动就能轻而易举地解决自身的衣食问题。他们男欢女爱，生儿育女，但我从未发现他们贪淫好色。在我们地球上几乎所有的人都难逃淫荡的劫数，淫欲是人类万恶之源。他们为新生命的降临而欢天喜地，这是他们幸福乐园的新人。他们相互间没有争吵，没有妒忌，甚至不知道争吵与嫉妒为何物。他们的孩子是大家的，因为大家组成一个家庭。他们差不多完全没有疾病，虽然也有死亡；他们的老人死得安详，好像睡着了似的，人们围在身旁为他送终，他含笑地向人们祝福，人们也报以愉悦的微笑送别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were as gay and sportive as children. They wandered about their lovely woods and copses, they sang their lovely songs; their fair was light -- the fruits of their trees, the honey from their woods, and the milk of the animals who loved them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都像孩子们那样欢蹦乱跳、兴高采烈。他们在自己美丽的园林中和树林里漫游，唱着自己优美的歌儿，食用容易消化的食物、自己树上的果实、自己森林里的蜂蜜，以及那些喜欢他们的动物的乳汁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I never saw grief or tears on those occasions, but only love, which reached the point of ecstasy, but a calm ecstasy, made perfect and contemplative. One might think that they were still in contact with the departed after death, and that their earthly union was not cut short by death. They scarcely understood me when I questioned them about immortality, but evidently they were so convinced of it without reasoning that it was not for them a question at all. They had no temples, but they had a real living and uninterrupted sense of oneness with the whole of the universe; they had no creed, but they had a certain knowledge that when their earthly joy had reached the limits of earthly nature, then there would come for them, for the living and for the dead, a still greater fullness of contact with the whole of the universe. They looked forward to that moment with joy, but without haste, not pining for it, but seeming to have a foretaste of it in their hearts, of which they talked to one another. In the evening before going to sleep they liked singing in musical and harmonious chorus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，我没有看见人们悲伤、流泪，有的只是加倍的恍若狂喜的爱，但却是一种泰然、充实、沉静的狂喜。可以认为，他们和逝者之间，甚至在他死后仍然互相交往，死亡也割不断彼此的尘世联系。当我问及他们有无永恒的生命时，他们近乎不懂我的意思，但很显然，他们坚信不疑，对他们而言这不成为问题。他们这里没有寺庙，但他们与整个宇宙有着休戚相关、生气勃勃、分割不开的联系；他们不信宗教，但他们确信，当人间的欢乐达到尘世的极限时，那么，对他们——生者和死者来说，同整个宇宙更为广泛的交往就会到来。他们兴味盎然地盼望着这一时刻，不慌不忙，无忧无虑，似乎早已胸有成竹，互通信息。每晚睡觉以前，他们都爱同声合唱和谐悦耳的歌曲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of their songs, solemn and rapturous, I scarcely understood at all. Though I understood the words I could never fathom their full significance. It remained, as it were, beyond the grasp of my mind, yet my heart unconsciously absorbed it more and more. I often told them that I had had a presentiment of it long before, that this joy and glory had come to me on our earth in the form of a yearning melancholy that at times approached insufferable sorrow; that I had had a foreknowledge of them all and of their glory in the dreams of my heart and the visions of my mind; that often on our earth I could not look at the setting sun without tears…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另有一些歌曲庄严奔放，我差不多全听不懂。我认识歌词，但老是品味不出其中的全部含义。我的脑子似乎难于理解，但我的心灵却似乎在不知不觉中愈来愈领悟得到。我常常对他们说，这一切我过去早有预感，所有这些欢乐和赞歌在我们地球上对我来说却是无边的忧烦，有时竟是难以忍受的痛苦；当我的心灵进入梦幻，脑海中出现憧憬时，我就预感到会有他们这些人，会有他们的赞歌；在我们地球上，面对西斜的残阳我常常热泪涔涔……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In those songs they expressed all the sensations that the parting day had given them, sang its glories and took leave of it. They sang the praises of nature, of the sea, of the woods. They liked making songs about one another, and praised each other like children; they were the simplest songs, but they sprang from their hearts and went to one's heart. And not only in their songs but in all their lives they seemed to do nothing but admire one another. It was like being in love with each other, but an all-embracing, universal feeling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们用这些歌曲表达一天的种种感受，讴歌和告别即将逝去的一天。他们赞美大自然，赞美大地，赞美海洋，赞美森林。他们喜好创作描写对方的歌曲，像小孩那样互相夸赞；这是一些质朴无华的歌，但它们发自内心，感人肺腑。不只在歌曲中，看来也在度过整个一生中，他们都是互相赞赏的。这是无所不包、普普通通的一种爱慕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, everyone laughs in my face now, and assures me that one cannot dream of such details as I am telling now, that I only dreamed or felt one sensation that arose in my heart in delirium and made up the details myself when I woke up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，所有的人现在都当面嘲笑我，一口咬定说，梦里的东西不可能像我现在所描述的那样细致入微，我在梦中的所见或感受不过是梦境产生的幻象，而那些细节是我梦醒后自己杜撰出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That in my hatred for the men of our earth there was always a yearning anguish: why could I not hate them without loving them? why could I not help forgiving them? and in my love for them there was a yearning grief: why could I not love them without hating them? They listened to me, and I saw they could not conceive what I was saying, but I did not regret that I had spoken to them of it: I knew that they understood the intensity of my yearning anguish over those whom I had left. But when they looked at me with their sweet eyes full of love, when I felt that in their presence my heart, too, became as innocent and just as theirs, the feeling of the fullness of life took my breath away, and I worshipped them in silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我恨我们地球上的人，但恨中总包含着苦闷：我为什么恨他们而又不能不爱他们呢？我为什么不能不宽恕他们呢？我爱他们，但爱中也总是有着苦闷：我为什么爱他们又同时要恨他们呢？看得出来，这里的人听了之后，不理解我说的什么，但我不会因为我同他们说过一席话而感到遗憾，因为我知道，他们理解我无限思念我别离的那些人。是啊，当他们用充盈爱抚的亲切目光瞧着我的时候，当我在他们面前，感到我的心灵也逐渐变得像他们的一样纯洁、诚实的时候，我就不再因为不理解他们而有所遗憾了。生活竟是如此充实、丰满。身临其境的一番感受使我精神激奋，于是我默默地祝福他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And when I told them that perhaps it really was so, my God, how they shouted with laughter in my face, and what mirth I caused! Oh, yes, of course I was overcome by the mere sensation of my dream, and that was all that was preserved in my cruelly wounded heart; but the actual forms and images of my dream, that is, the very ones I really saw at the very time of my dream, were filled with such harmony, were so lovely and enchanting and were so actual, that on awakening I was, of course, incapable of clothing them in our poor language, so that they were bound to become blurred in my mind; and so perhaps I really was forced afterwards to make up the details, and so of course to distort them in my passionate desire to convey some at least of them as quickly as I could. But on the other hand, how can I help believing that it was all true? It was perhaps a thousand times brighter, happier and more joyful than I describe it. Granted that I dreamed it, yet it must have been real.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我向他们坦言，说实际上也许是如此时——天啊，他们当着我的面笑得有多欢，他们有多快活啊！是啊，真的如此，我完全被梦幻的感受陶醉了，而且只有这种感受才完整地保留在我备受创伤的心中：可是，梦中真实的形体和真实的形态，即梦境中实际所见的那些形象，丰满得如此和谐，如此美妙，如此生动，以致我梦醒后自然无法用我们贫乏的语言去表达出来，因而它们在我的脑海里必然变得淡漠起来，于是在后来，我也许真的不自觉地编造出一些细节，尤其在情急之下想一吐为快，失实之事自然难免了。不过，我怎能不相信这都是实有的呢？事实也许比我说的还要完美、清晰和兴味千倍呢？就算这是一场梦，然而，这一切不可能是没有的。">查看中文翻译</div>

For then something happened so awful, something so horribly true, that it could not have been imagined in a dream. My heart may have originated the dream, but would my heart alone have been capable of originating the awful event which happened to me afterwards? How could I alone have invented it or imagined it in my dream? Could my petty heart and fickle, trivial mind have risen to such a revelation of truth?
