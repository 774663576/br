<div class="line_en">It occurred to me the next morning that under the exhilaration produced by Tin-ho or the Perfect Winning, I might have been slightly indiscreet. True, Poirot had not asked me to keep the discovery of the ring to myself. On the other hand, he had said nothing about it whilst at Fernly, and as far as I knew, I was the only person aware that it had been found. I felt distinctly guilty. The fact was by now spreading through King's Abbot like wildfire. I was expecting wholesale reproaches from Poirot any minute.</div>

<div class="line_en">After it was over, Poirot, who had also been present, took me by the arm, and invited me to accompany him back to The Larches. He was looking very grave, and I feared that my indiscretion of the night before had got round to his ears. But it soon transpired that his thoughts were occupied by something of a totally different nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波洛也出席了葬礼。葬礼刚一结束，他就拽着我，邀我一起回‘落叶松’。见他一脸严肃，我猜测他已经听说昨晚我说漏嘴的事了。但很快我就发现，他盘算的根本是另一个问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I see no object in withholding the information," said Hammond, after a moment or two. "During the past year, Mrs Ferrars has sold out certain securities, and the money for them was paid into her account and not re-invested. As her income was a large one, and she lived very quietly after her husband's death, it seems certain that these sums of money were paid away for some special purpose. I once sounded her on the subject, and she said that she was obliged to support several of her husband's poor relations. I let the matter drop, of course. Until now, I have always imagined that the money was paid to some woman who had had a claim on Ashley Ferrars. I never dreamed that Mrs Ferrars herself was involved."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想也没必要再隐瞒了。”片刻后，哈蒙德说，“过去一年内，弗拉尔斯太太卖出不少债券，款项都存进她的账户，而没有用于重新投资。她的收入相当可观，况且丈夫去世后，她日子也过得很安稳，可见这些钱都有特殊用途。我曾向她问起，她说自己不得不接济丈夫的几位穷亲戚，我也就不便再过问。直到如今我还在揣测，那些钱会不会给了某个与阿什利·弗拉尔斯有私情的女人。我做梦也没想到，居然是弗拉尔斯太太自己惹上了麻烦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let us take a man -- a very ordinary man. A man with no idea of murder in his heart. There is in him somewhere a strain of weakness -- deep down. It has so far never been called into play. Perhaps it never will be -- and if so he will go to his grave honoured and respected by everyone. But let us suppose that something occurs. He is in difficulties -- or perhaps not that even. He may stumble by accident on a secret -- a secret involving life or death to someone. And his first impulse will be to speak out -- to do his duty as an honest citizen. And then the strain of weakness tells. Here is a chance of money -- a great amount of money. He wants money -- he desires it -- and it is so easy. He has to do nothing for it -- just keep silence. That is the beginning. The desire for money grows. He must have more -- and more! He is intoxicated by the gold mine which has opened at his feet. He becomes greedy. And in his greed he overreaches himself. One can press a man as far as one likes -- but with a woman one must not press too far. For a woman has at heart a great desire to speak the truth. How many husbands who have deceived their wives go comfortably to their graves, carrying their secret with them! How many wives who have deceived their husbands wreck their lives by throwing the fact in those same husbands' teeth! They have been pressed too far. In a reckless moment (which they will afterwards regret, bien entendu) they fling safety to the winds and turn at bay, proclaiming the truth with great momentary satisfaction to themselves. So it was, I think, in this case. The strain was too great. And so there came your proverb, the death of the goose that laid the golden eggs. But that is not the end. Exposure faced the man of whom we are speaking. And he is not the same man he was -- say, a year ago. His moral fibre is blunted. He is desperate. He is fighting a losing battle, and he is prepared to take any means that come to his hand, for exposure means ruin to him. And so -- the dagger strikes!" He was silent for a moment. It was as though he had laid a spell upon the room. I cannot try to describe the impression his words produced. There was something in the merciless analysis, and the ruthless power of vision which struck fear into both of us.</div>
