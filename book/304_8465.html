<div class="line_en">M. Hercule Poirot was a little late in entering the luncheon-car on the following day. He had risen early, breakfasted almost alone, and had spent the morning going over the notes of the case that was recalling him to London. He had seen little of his travelling companion.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not till they were eating a delicate cream cheese that M. Bouc allowed his attention to wander to matters other than nourishment. He was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic.</div>

<div class="line_en">M. Bouc, who was already seated, gesticulated a greeting and summoned his friend to the empty place opposite him. Poirot sat down and soon found himself in the favoured position of the table which was served first and with the choicest morsels. The food, too, was unusually good.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, you agree? It has not been done, I think? And yet -- it lends itself to romance, my friend. All around us are people, of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people, these strangers to one another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot get away from each other. At the end of three days they part, they go their several ways, never, perhaps, to see each other again."</div>

<div class="line_en">At the table opposite them were three men. They were, he guessed, single travellers graded and placed there by the unerring judgment of the restaurant attendants. A big, swarthy Italian was picking his teeth with gusto. Opposite him a spare, neat Englishman had the expressionless disapproving face of the well-trained servant. Next to the Englishman was a big American in a loud suit -- possibly a commercial traveller.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们对面那一桌坐着三个男人，他猜他们三个是独自旅行的，经过餐车服务员的准确判断之后被安排在这里。一个高大而黝黑的意大利人正起劲儿地剔着牙，他对面是个瘦削而整洁的英国人，一看就知道是个受过良好训练的仆人，一脸不以为然的神情。英国人旁边是个大块头美国人，穿着俗气的西装——可能是个旅行推销员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sipped his wine. Then, leaning back, he ran his eye thoughtfully round the dining car. There were thirteen people seated there and, as M. Bouc had said, of all classes and nationalities. He began to study them.</div>

<div class="line_en">At a small table, sitting very upright, was one of the ugliest old ladies he had ever seen. It was an ugliness of distinction -- it fascinated rather than repelled. She sat very upright. Round her neck was a collar of very large pearls which, improbable though it seemed, were real. Her hands were covered with rings. Her sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders. A very small expensive black toque was hideously unbecoming to the yellow, toad-like face beneath it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一张小桌子旁边，笔挺地坐着一位他见所未见的丑到极点的老太太。那是一种显而易见的丑陋，与其说令人厌恶，还不如说是令人不解。她腰板儿挺得很直，脖子上戴着一条硕大的珍珠项链，看着不像是真的。两只手戴满了戒指。貂皮大衣披在肩上，一顶小巧、珍贵的无檐丝绒帽和下面那张蜡黄的、癞蛤蟆似的脸极不相称。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear, courteous but completely autocratic tone.</div>

<div class="line_en">At another of the large tables Mary Debenham was sitting with two other women. One of them was a tall middle-aged woman in a plaid blouse and tweed skirt. She had a mass of faded yellow hair unbecomingly arranged in a large bun, wore glasses, and had a long, mild, amiable face rather like a sheep. She was listening to the third woman, a stout, pleasant-faced, elderly woman who was talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no signs of pausing for breath or coming to a stop.</div>

'They just haven't got any hustle in them.' But all the same you'd be surprised to know what our college there is doing. They've gotten a fine staff of teachers.

A tight-fitting little black coat and skirt, white satin blouse, small chic black toque perched at the fashionable outrageous angle. She had a beautiful foreign-looking face, dead white skin, large brown eyes, jet-black hair. She was smoking a cigarette in a long holder. Her manicured hands had deep red nails. She wore one large emerald set in platinum. There was coquetry in her glance and voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对面的那位是个妙龄女郎——也就二十岁。她穿着黑色紧身的小外套和裙子，白缎衬衫，小巧时髦的黑帽子很别扭地戴在头上。她长着一张精致的外国人的脸，皮肤白皙，棕色的大眼睛，乌黑的头发，修剪精致、涂着深红色指甲油的手指夹着一根长烟嘴香烟，戴着一枚镶祖母绿的白金戒指。无论长相还是声音，都十分娇媚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were only two more lunchers -- Poirot's fellow traveller MacQueen and his employer Mr. Ratchett. The latter sat facing Poirot, and for the second time Poirot studied that unprepossessing face, noting the false benevolence of the brow and the small, cruel eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有两个人在吃午饭——波洛的旅伴麦奎因和他的主人雷切特先生。后者面朝波洛坐着，于是波洛再一次研究起那张讨人厌的脸来，那对眉毛和恶毒的小眼睛都流露出假仁假义。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After her came a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly together. The man wore English clothes of loose tweed -- but he was not English. Though only the back of his head was visible to Poirot, the shape of it and the set of the shoulders betrayed him. A big man, well made. He turned his head suddenly and Poirot saw his profile. A very handsome man of thirty odd with a big fair moustache.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波洛的目光越过她，看到一对身体前倾、谈笑风生的情侣。男人穿着宽松的花呢英式服装，但不是英国人。波洛只能看见他的后脑，但是脑袋的形状和肩膀的模样，透露出此人身形魁梧匀称。他突然转过头，波洛看到了他的侧面。一个三十多岁的男人，相貌英俊，蓄着一大撮漂亮的胡子。">查看中文翻译</div>
