<div class="line_en">I was way early when I got there, so I just sat down on one of those leather couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls. A lot of schools were home for vacation already, and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around waiting for their dates to show up. Girls with their legs crossed, girls with their legs not crossed, girls with terrific legs, girls with lousy legs, girls that looked like swell girls, girls that looked like they'd be bitches if you knew them. It was really nice sightseeing, if you know what I mean. In a way, it was sort of depressing, too, because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them. When they got out of school and college, I mean. You figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys. Guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars. Guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf, or even just some stupid game like ping-pong. Guys that are very mean. Guys that never read books. Guys that are very boring -- But I have to be careful about that. I mean about calling certain guys bores. I don't understand boring guys. I really don't. When I was at Elkton Hills, I roomed for about two months with this boy, Harris Macklin. He was very intelligent and all, but he was one of the biggest bores I ever met. He had one of these very raspy voices, and he never stopped talking, practically. He never stopped talking, and what was awful was, he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he could do one thing. The sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody I ever heard. He'd be making his bed, or hanging up stuff in the closet -- he was always hanging up stuff in the closet -- it drove me crazy -- and he'd be whistling while he did it, if he wasn't talking in this raspy voice. He could even whistle classical stuff, but most of the time he just whistled jazz. He could take something very jazzy, like "Tin Roof Blues," and whistle it so nice and easy -- right while he was hanging stuff up in the closet -- that it could kill you. Naturally, I never told him I thought he was a terrific whistler. I mean you don't just go up to somebody and say, "You're a terrific whistler." But I roomed with him for about two whole months, even though he bored me till I was half crazy, just because he was such a terrific whistler, the best I ever heard. So I don't know about bores. Maybe you shouldn't feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them. They don't hurt anybody, most of them, and maybe they're secretly all terrific whistlers or something. Who the hell knows? Not me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可他有一个长处。这个婊子养的吹起口哨来，可比谁都好。他一边铺床，或是一边往壁橱里挂着什么――他老是往壁橱里挂着什么――真叫我受不了――他一边干着这类玩艺儿，一边就吹着口哨，只要他不是在用刺耳的声音讲话。他连古典歌曲都能吹，可他绝大部分时间只吹着爵士歌曲。他都能吹最地道的爵士歌曲，象《白铁屋顶忧伤曲》之类，而且吹得那么好听，那么轻松愉快――就在他往壁橱里挂什么东西的时候――你听了都会灵魂儿出窍。自然啦，我从来没告诉他我认为他的口哨吹的好得了不得。我是说你决不会走到什么人身边直截了当地说：“你的口哨吹的好得了不得。”可我还是跟他同屋住了差不多整整两个月，尽管我把他讨厌得要命，原因是，他的口哨吹得真是好极了，是我听到过的最最好的。所以说我不了解讨人厌的家伙。也许你瞧见哪个挺不错的姑娘嫁给他们的时候心里不应该太难受。他们中间绝大多数并不害人，再说他们私下里也许都是了不得的口哨家什么的。他妈的谁知道？至少我不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, old Sally started coming up the stairs, and I started down to meet her. She looked terrific. She really did. She had on this black coat and sort of a black beret. She hardly ever wore a hat, but that beret looked nice. The funny part is, I felt like marrying her the minute I saw her. I'm crazy. I didn't even like her much, and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. I swear to God I'm crazy. I admit it.</div>

<div class="line_en">We horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater. At first she didn't want to, because she had her lipstick on and all, but I was being seductive as hell and she didn't have any alternative. Twice, when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic, I damn near fell off the seat. Those damn drivers never even look where they're going, I swear they don't. Then, just to show you how crazy I am, when we were coming out of this big clinch, I told her I loved her and all. It was a lie, of course, but the thing is, I meant it when I said it. I'm crazy. I swear to God I am.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在去戏院的路上，我们在汽车里胡搞了一会儿。最初她不肯，因为她搽着口红什么的，可我真是他妈的猴急得要命，她简直拿我没办法。有两次，汽车在红灯前突然停住，我都他妈的差点儿从座上摔了下来。这些混帐司机从来不注意自己的汽车在往哪儿开，我敢发誓他们从来不注意。现在，我再来告诉你我究竟疯狂到了什么地步，当我们在这次热烈的拥抱中清醒过来的时候，我竞对她说我爱她。这当然是撤谎，不过问题是，我说的时候，倒真是说的心里话。我真是疯了。我可以对天发誓我真是疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The show wasn't as bad as some I've seen. It was on the crappy side, though. It was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple. It starts out when they're young and all, and the girl's parents don't want her to marry the boy, but she marries him anyway. Then they keep getting older and older. The husband goes to war, and the wife has this brother that's a drunkard. I couldn't get very interested. I mean I didn't care too much when anybody in the family died or anything. They were all just a bunch of actors. The husband and wife were a pretty nice old couple -- very witty and all -- but I couldn't get too interested in them. For one thing, they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play. Every time you saw them, some butler was shoving some tea in front of them, or the wife was pouring it for somebody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这戏倒不象我过去看过的某些戏那么糟。可也不怎么好。故事讲的是一对夫妇一生中约莫五十万年里的事。开始时候他们都很年轻，姑娘的父母不答应她跟那个小伙子结婚，可她最后还是跟他结婚了。接着他们的年纪越来越大。丈夫出征了，妻子有个弟弟是个醉鬼。我看了实在不感兴趣。我是说我对他们家里有人死了什么的毫不关心。他们不过是一嘟噜演员罢了。那丈夫和妻子倒是一对挺不错的夫妇――很有点儿鬼聪明――可我对他们并不太感兴趣。特别是，他们在整场戏里老是在喝着茶或者其他混帐玩艺儿。你每次看见他们，总有个佣人拿茶端到他们面前，或是那妻子在倒茶给什么人喝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="还有戏里不住有人进进出出――你光是看着人们坐下站起都会看得头昏眼花。阿尔法莱德．伦特和琳。封丹演那对夫妇，他们演得非常好，可我不怎么喜欢他们。不过凭良心说，他们确是与众不同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When one of them got finished making a speech, the other one said something very fast right after it. It was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all. The trouble was, it was too much like people talking and interrupting each other. They acted a little bit the way old Ernie, down in the Village, plays the piano. If you do something too good, then, after a while, if you don't watch it, you start showing off. And then you're not as good any more. But anyway, they were the only ones in the show -- the Lunts, I mean -- that looked like they had any real brains. I have to admit it.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette. What a deal that was. You never saw so many phonies in all your life, everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they were. Some dopey movie actor was standing near us, having a cigarette. I don't know his name, but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before it's time to go over the top. He was with some gorgeous blonde, and the two of them were trying to be very blasé and all, like as if he didn't even know people were looking at him. Modest as hell. I got a big bang out of it. Old Sally didn't talk much, except to rave about the Lunts, because she was busy rubbering and being charming. Then all of a sudden, she saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby. Some guy in one of those very dark gray flannel suits and one of those checkered vests. Strictly Ivy League. Big deal. He was standing next to the wall, smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell. Old Sally kept saying, "I know that boy from somewhere." She always knew somebody, any place you took her, or thought she did. She kept saying that till I got bored as hell, and I said to her, "Why don't you go on over and give him a big soul kiss, if you know him? He'll enjoy it." She got sore when I said that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="演完第一幕，我们就跟其他那些傻瓜蛋一起出去抽烟。这真是个盛举。你这一辈子从未见过有这么多的伪君子聚在一起，每个人都拼命袖烟，大声谈论戏，让别人都能听见他们的声音，知道他们有多么了不起。有个傻里傻气的电影演员站在我们附近抽烟。我不知道他的名字，可他老是在战争片里担任胆小鬼的角色。他跟一个极漂亮的金发姑娘在一起，他们两个都装出很厌倦的样子，好象甚至都不知道周围有人在看他们似的。真是谦虚得要命。我看了倒是十分开心。老萨丽除了夸奖伦特夫妇外，简宣很少说话，因为她正忙着伸长脖子东张西望，装出一副迷人的样子。接着她突然看见休息室的另一头有一个她认识的傻瓜蛋。那家伙穿了套深灰色的法兰绒衣服，一件格子衬衫，是个地道的名牌大学生。真了不起。他靠墙站着，只顾没命地抽烟，一副腻烦极了的样子。老萨丽不住地说：“我认识那小伙子。”不管你带她去什么地方，她总认识什么人，或者她自以为认识什么人。她说了又说，后来我腻烦透了，就对她说：“你既然认识他，干吗不过去亲亲热热地吻他一下呢？他准会高兴。”她听了这话很生气。">查看中文翻译</div>

You'd have thought they'd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids. Old buddyroos. It was nauseating. The funny part was, they probably met each other just once, at some phony party. Finally, when they were all done slobbering around, old Sally introduced us.</div>

<div class="line_en">His name was George something -- I don't even remember -- and he went to Andover. Big, big deal. You should've seen him when old Sally asked him how he liked the play. He was the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebody's question. He stepped back, and stepped right on the lady's foot behind him. He probably broke every toe in her body. He said the play itself was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts, of course, were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake. Angels. That killed me.</div>

He sounded just like a girl. He didn't hesitate to horn in on my date, the bastard. I even thought for a minute that he was going to get in the goddam cab with us when the show was over, because he walked about two blocks with us, but he had to meet a bunch of phonies for cocktails, he said.
