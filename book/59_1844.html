<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Daniel. "I can't see the land now." He looked to the west, but he could see no land, no lights. Only water -- big grey waves with white tops, which went up and down, up and down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”丹尼尔说，“现在我已经看不见陆地了。”他向西望去，但是看不见陆地，也看不见任何亮光。他只看见海水——顶着白色浪尖的灰色巨浪不断地起伏汹涌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Daniel Donovan was a passenger on the For farshire. He stood on the deck of the ship, and looked at the sea. It was difficult to stand on the deck, because the wind was so strong. The ship was moving up and down uncomfortably and Daniel felt ill. Then a big wave hit the side of the ship, and salt water flew into his face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The wind is getting stronger," said a passenger beside him. He was a tall, dark man with a black coat -- Mr Robb, a churchman. "And it's getting darker, too."</div>

<div class="line_en">Daniel looked down at the big paddle wheel on the side of the ship. It went round and round, down under the white water, and up again… under the water, and up. Then he looked up at the black smoke which came from the For farshire's funnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼尔低头看船侧的巨大桨轮，它们不停转动，时而深入白色的水下，时而钻出水面…周而复始。接着他抬起头来，看着福法尔郡号烟囱里冒出的黑烟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Daniel looked behind him, and saw a small boy. He was running across the deck. He was only three or four years old, and the wind was much too strong for him. He fell over on the deck and began to cry. Then another big wave hit the side of the ship. The white water came over the side and carried the boy along the deck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼尔往身后一瞧，看到一个小男孩。他正从甲板那边跑过来。他只有三四岁，这风对他来说是太大了。他摔倒在甲板上，哭了起来。正在这时又一个巨浪击中船侧，白色的海浪冲过船舷，把小男孩沿着甲板冲出了一段距离。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sea-bird flew low across the white tops of the big, grey waves. Daniel watched it, and felt wind and rain on his face. Then a door opened behind him, and a woman screamed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," he said. "They're good, strong engines." But he was not really sure. He was an engineer, so he knew about engines. Sometimes the For farshire's engines made strange noises, and the paddle wheels went round slowly. Then there was a crash, and they went quickly again. Daniel was not happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”他说，“它们是强有力的引擎。”但他其实并不肯定。他是一名机械师，熟悉引擎。福法尔郡号的引擎时不时会发出异常的噪音，桨轮也转得缓慢。接着会发出撞击声，桨轮又恢复快速转动。丹尼尔忧心忡忡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, he looked up at the ship's funnel. There was no smoke above it. He looked over the side of the ship, at the big paddle wheels. He watched them for two minutes, but they did not move. And all the time the big grey waves lifted the For farshire up and down, and white water blew over the deck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了外面，他抬头看轮船的烟囱——上面没有冒烟。他从船侧探头察看巨大的桨轮，看了两分钟，但它们一动不动。而灰色的大浪一直载着福法尔郡号不断上下颠簸，白色的水花飞溅到甲板上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Daniel listened. "My God," he thought. "She's right! The engines have stopped!" He could hear the noise of the wind and the sea, but not the engines. "You're right, Mrs Dawson," he said. He stood up, and ran to the door. "Excuse me. I…" But then he opened the door, and his words were lost in the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼尔听了听。“天哪，”他想，“她说得对！引擎已经停了！”他能听到狂风和大海的喧嚣声，但听不到引擎的声音。“您说得对，道森夫人。”说着他站了起来，向门口跑去。“失陪一下，我…”但接着他打开门，话音随之消散在风里。">查看中文翻译</div>
