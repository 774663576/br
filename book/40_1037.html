<div class="line_en">On April 17, 1978, the year Mariam turned nineteen, a man named Mir Akbar Khyber was found murdered. Two days later, there was a large demonstration in Kabul. Everyone in the neighborhood was in the streets talking about it. Through the window, Mariam saw neighbors milling about, chatting excitedly, transistor radios pressed to their ears. She saw Fariba leaning against the wall of her house, talking with a woman who was new to Deh-Mazang. Fariba was smiling, and her palms were pressed against the swell of her pregnant belly. The other woman, whose name escaped Mariam, looked older than Fariba, and her hair had an odd purple tint to it. She was holding a little boy's hand. Mariam knew the boy's name was Tariq, because she had heard this woman on the street call after him by that name.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam and Rasheed didn't join the neighbors. They listened in on the radio as some ten thousand people poured into the streets and marched up and down Kabul's government district. Rasheed said that Mir Akbar Khyber had been a prominent communist, and that his supporters were blaming the murder on President Daoud Khan's government. He didn't look at her when he said this. These days, he never did anymore, and Mariam wasn't ever sure if she was being spoken to.</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't easy tolerating him talking this way to her, to bear his scorn, his ridicule, his insults, his walking past her like she was nothing but a house cat. But after four years of marriage, Mariam saw clearly how much a woman could tolerate when she was afraid. And Mariam was afraid. She lived in fear of his shifting moods, his volatile temperament, his insistence on steering even mundane exchanges down a confrontational path that, on occasion, he would resolve with punches, slaps, kicks, and sometimes try to make amends for with polluted apologies and sometimes not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要容忍他和她说话的这种语气，承受他的指责、嘲弄和辱骂，忍受他把她当作一只家猫似的、视若无睹地从她身边走过，可并不是一件容易的事情。但经过了四年的婚姻生活之后，玛丽雅姆清楚地看到一个心存恐惧的女人的忍耐度有多么大。玛丽雅姆是一个心怀恐惧的女人。她害怕他反复无常的心情和暴烈的脾气，她也害怕他的专横，甚至平时买点油盐酱醋也会惹他发火，一次又一次地招来他的耳光和拳打脚踢，而过后，他有时候会说着脏话道歉，有时候则不会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now nothing she did pleased him. She cleaned the house, made sure he always had a supply of clean shirts, cooked him his favorite dishes. Once, disastrously, she even bought makeup and put it on for him. But when he came home, he took one look at her and winced with such distaste that she rushed to the bathroom and washed it all off, tears of shame mixing with soapy water, rouge, and mascara.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在无论她做什么，都无法令他高兴。她清扫屋子，确保他总是有一些干干净净的衬衣可穿，烹调他爱吃的饭菜。有一次，万般无奈的她甚至还买来了化妆品，为他上了妆。但当他回家时，他看了她一眼，厌恶之情溢于言表，她赶忙跑进浴室，把脸上的妆全都冲掉，耻辱的泪水和香皂水、口红、睫毛膏混在一起流下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now Mariam dreaded the sound of him coming home in the evening. The key rattling, the creak of the door -- these were sounds that set her heart racing. From her bed, she listened to the click-clack of his heels, to the muffled shuffling of his feet after he'd shed his shoes. With her ears, she took inventory of his doings: chair legs dragged across the floor, the plaintive squeak of the cane seat when he sat, the clinking of spoon against plate, the flutter of newspaper pages flipped, the slurping of water. And as her heart pounded, her mind wondered what excuse he would use that night to pounce on her. There was always something, some minor thing that would infuriate him, because no matter what she did to please him, no matter how thoroughly she submitted to his wants and demands, it wasn't enough. She could not give him his son back. In this most essential way, she had failed him -- seven times she had failed him -- and now she was nothing but a burden to him. She could see it in the way he looked at her, when he looked at her. She was a burden to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今，玛丽雅姆害怕听到他夜里回家的脚步声，钥匙开锁的咔嗒声，房门打开的吱嘎声——这些声音都让她心跳加速。她躺在床上，听着他清脆的鞋跟落地声，听着他把鞋子脱掉之后沉闷的、拖着脚走路的声音。光凭耳朵，她能听出来他在干什么：椅子的脚被拖着擦过地板；他坐在藤椅上，不堪重负的藤椅发出凄凉的叫声；他拿着调羹敲击盘子的声音；他翻阅报纸时报纸发出的沙沙声；喝水时发出的啧啧声。她的心怦怦跳，脑里思索这个晚上他又会找什么借口来殴打自己。总会有些事情，一些微不足道的事情，会让他大发雷霆；因为她无论做什么，都不能让他高兴；无论她有多么死心塌地地听从于他的要求与命令，她总是做得不够好。她无法把他的儿子还给他。就这至关重要的一点上来说，她已经让他大失所望——七次让他大失所望——如今，对他来说，她只是负担而已。从他看着她的眼神中——假如看着她的话——她能看出这一点。她是他的负担。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the four years since the day at the bathhouse, there had been six more cycles of hopes raised then dashed, each loss, each collapse, each trip to the doctor more crushing for Mariam than the last. With each disappointment, Rasheed had grown more remote and resentful.</div>

<div class="line_en">LATER IN THE DAY, Rasheed was still trying the radio as Mariam made rice with spinach sauce in the kitchen. Mariam remembered a time when she had enjoyed, even looked forward to, cooking for Rasheed. Now cooking was an exercise in heightened anxiety. The qurmas were always too salty or too bland for his taste. The rice was judged either too greasy or too dry, the bread declared too doughy or too crispy. Rasheed's faultfinding left her stricken in the kitchen with self-doubt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚些时候，玛丽雅姆在厨房做米饭和菠菜汤，拉希德仍在调试收音机。玛丽雅姆记得曾经有一段时间她很喜欢、甚至期待给拉希德做饭。但现在，做饭成了一件令她提心吊胆的事情。做出来的汤，他不是嫌太咸就是嫌太淡。米饭不是太烂就是太生，面包不是太软就是太脆。由于拉希德这种鸡蛋里挑骨头的态度，她在厨房里总是战战兢兢，对自己毫无信心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">ON APRIL 27, Mariam's question was answered with crackling sounds and intense, sudden roars. She ran barefoot down to the living room and found Rasheed already by the window, in his undershirt, his hair disheveled, palms pressed to the glass. Mariam made her way to the window next to him. Overhead, she could see military planes zooming past, heading north and east. Their deafening shrieks hurt her ears. In the distance, loud booms resonated and sudden plumes of smoke rose to the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="4月27日，一阵枪炮声和突然响起的喧哗声回答了玛丽雅姆的问题。她光着脚丫，跑到楼下的客厅，发现拉希德已经站在窗边，身上只穿着内衣内裤，头发凌乱，双手按在玻璃窗上。玛丽雅姆走到窗边，站在他身旁。她看到战斗机在天空中渐升渐高，向北和向东飞去。它们震耳欲聋的呼啸声让她耳朵发痛。远方传来爆炸声的回响，突然之间，缕缕烟尘升向空中。">查看中文翻译</div>

Daoud Khan had been killed, but not before the communist rebels had killed some twenty members of his family, including women and grandchildren. There would be rumors that he had taken his own life, that he'd been gunned down in the heat of battle; rumors that he'd been saved for last, made to watch the massacre of his family, then shot.</div>

Kabul Radio, the ministries of Communication and the Interior, and the Foreign Ministry building had also been captured. Kabul was in the hands of the people now, he said proudly. Rebel MiGs had attacked the Presidential Palace. Tanks had broken into the premises, and a fierce battle was under way there.

They were marveling at the baby's light hair, at her pink cheeks and puckered, rosebud lips, at the slits of jade green eyes moving behind her puffy lids. They smiled at each other when they heard her voice for the first time, a cry that started like the mewl of a cat and exploded into a healthy, full-throated yowl.
