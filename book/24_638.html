<div class="line_en">To make things more unfair, Karellen himself recorded the whole proceedings. Reporters guilty of carelessness, or downright misrepresentation -- though this was very rare -- had been summoned to short and unpleasant sessions with Karellen's underlings and required to listen attentively to playbacks of what the Supervisor had really said. The lesson was not one that ever had to be repeated.</div>

<div class="line_en">There had, of course, been several attempts to smuggle in recorders. They had been successfully smuggled out again, but a single glance at their smoking interiors had shown the futility of the experiment. Everyone understood, then, why they had always been warned, in their own interest, to leave watches and other metallic objects outside the conference room.</div>

<div class="line_en">The conference room was always crowded for these weekly meetings, but today it was so closely packed that the reporters had difficulty in writing. For the hundredth time, they grumbled to each other at Karellen's conservatism and lack of consideration. Anywhere else in the world they could have brought TV cameras, tape recorders, and all the other tools of their highly mechanized trade. But here they had to rely on such archaic devices as paper and pencil -- and even, incredible to relate, shorthand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林每周一次的记者招待会，会场上总是拥挤不堪，今天更是挤得密不透风，连作笔记都成了问题，记者们抱怨卡瑞林的规定太保守，太不近人情。在别的任何地方，他们都可以携带摄像机、录音机和其他采访工具，单单在这儿，他们还得依赖纸和笔这样原始的装备，而且还得速记。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite a crowd today, Mr. Golde. There must be a shortage of news." The gentleman from the Times smiled and cleared his throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was strange how these rumours got around. No prior announcement was made, yet there was always a full house whenever Karellen had an important statement to make -- which happened, on the average, two or three times a year. Silence descended on the murmuring crowd as the great doorway split open and Karellen came forward on to the dais. The light here was dim -- approximating, no doubt, to that of the Overlords' far distant sun -- so that, the Supervisor for Earth had discarded the dark glasses he normally wore when in the open. He replied to the ragged chorus of greetings with a formal "Good morning, everybody," then turned to the tall, distinguished figure at the front of the crowd. Mr. Golde, doyen of the Press Club, might have been the original inspirer of the butler's announcement: "Three reporters, m'lud, and a gentleman from the Times." He dressed and behaved like a diplomat of the old school: no one would ever hesitate to confide in him, and no one had ever regretted it subsequently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道消息是怎样传开的，每次卡瑞林要宣布重要事情的时候，尽管事先没有发任何通知，会场上总是坐得满满的，这样的情况每年有两三次。门开了，卡瑞林走进来，朝讲台走去，人群安静下来。会议室里光线很暗，亮度可能跟外星人微弱的阳光差不多，卡瑞林没有像在户外那样戴墨镜。他说了声“各位，早上好”，算是回答了记者们此起彼伏的问候，接着他转向前排个子高高的戈德先生，记者俱乐部德高望重的老前辈。戈德先生就是“三名记者和一位《泰晤士报》的绅士”这句话里说的绅士，无论是穿着还是举止都像一个老派的外交家，每个见到他的人都会马上对他产生信任感，他也果然不负众望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I have some news for you. As you are doubtless aware, one of my supply ships recently left Earth to return to its base. We have just discovered that there was a stowaway on board."</div>

<div class="line_en">He watched intently as Karellen considered his reply. It seemed so unfair that the Overlords' faces, rigid as masks, betrayed no trace of emotion. The great, wide eyes, their pupils sharply contracted even in this indifferent light, stared fathomlessly back into the frankly curious human ones. The twin breathing orifices on either cheek -- if those fluted, basalt curves could be called cheeks -- emitted the faintest of whistles as Karellen's hypothetical lungs laboured in the thin air of Earth. Golde could just see the curtain of tiny white hairs fluttering to and fro, keeping accurately out of phase, as they responded to Karellen's rapid, double-action breathing cycle. Dust filters, they were generally believed to be, and elaborate theories concerning the atmosphere of the Overlords' home had been constructed on this slender foundation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="趁着卡瑞林思考该如何回答自己的问题，戈德留神观察着他，外星人的脸就像面具一样，看不出丁点儿的表情，一双眼睛大大的，瞳孔在这样微弱的光线中却依然很小很小，高深莫测地望着这群好奇的人。如果那个有凹槽的青黑色弧形表面能叫做脸颊的话，他的脸颊一边长着一对呼吸孔，发出微弱的声音，如果他有肺，那一定是肺呼吸着地球上稀薄的空气发出来的声音。白色的细毛像帘子一样垂在呼吸孔上，随着快速的一呼一吸摆动着。人们普遍认为那是外星人的沙尘过滤器，由此还出现了一些专门研究外星人生活环境的人，他们提出了好些新的理论。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"His name is Jan Rodricks: he is an engineering student from the University of Cape Town. Further details you can no doubt discover for yourselves through your own very efficient channels."</div>

<div class="line_en">"As for how he left," continued the Supervisor, "that is of secondary importance. I can assure you, or any other potential astronauts, that there is no possibility of repeating the exploit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至于他怎么离开的，”卡瑞林接着说，“这并不重要。我要说的是你们和那些想做宇航员的人休想再用相同的方法逃走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What will happen to this young man?" persisted Golde. "Will he be sent back to Earth?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们会怎样对待那个年轻人？”戈德追问道，“会把他送回来吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Karellen smiled. The Supervisor's smile was a curious affair. Most of the effect really resided in the eyes: the inflexible, lipless mouth scarcely moved at all. Was this, Golde wondered, another of the many human customs that Karellen had copied with such skill? For the total effect was, undoubtedly, that of a smile, and the mind readily accepted it as such.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林笑了，他的笑很奇怪，笑意主要在眼睛里，那张没有嘴唇的嘴几乎没有动。这会不会是他模仿来的又一个人类的习惯呢？当然，人们都更乐意看到笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is outside my jurisdiction, but I expect he will come back on the next ship. He would find conditions too -- alien -- for comfort where he has gone. And this leads me to the main purpose of our meeting today." Karellen paused, and the silence grew even deeper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这在我的权力范围之外了，我无权决定。我只是希望他能乘坐下班飞船回来。他会发现那是个完全陌生的地方，待着很难受。这就要谈到我们今天的主要内容了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There has been some complaint, among the younger and more romantic elements of your population, because outer space has been closed to you. We had a purpose in doing this: we do not impose bans for the pleasure of it. But have you ever stopped to consider -- if you will excuse a slightly unflattering analogy -- what a man from your Stone Age would have felt, if he suddenly found himself in a modern city?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不让你们进入太空，你们中的一些年轻人和其他抱着浪漫幻想的人有抱怨，我们这样做自有我们的目的，你们单纯为了兴趣爱好到太空去我们不加限制。但你们考虑过没有，打个比方，一个石器时代的人一下发现自己置身现代社会是一种怎样的感受？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Surely," protested the Herald Tribune, "there is a fundamental difference. We are accustomed to Science. On your world there are doubtless many things which we might not understand -- but they wouldn't seem magic to us."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you quite sure of that?" said Karellen, so softly that it was hard to hear his words. "Only a hundred years lies between the age of electricity and the age of steam, but what would a Victorian engineer have made of a television set or an electronic computer. And how long would he have lived if he started to investigate their workings? The gulf between two technologies can easily become so great that it is -- lethal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你就那么肯定？”卡瑞林问，声音低得几乎听不清，“从蒸汽时代发展到电力时代只用了一百年时间，但一个维多利亚时期的工程师会把电视机和计算机看成什么，他一生能有多少年时间来琢磨这些东西？两种技术之间的鸿沟太大，永远无法跨越。”">查看中文翻译</div>
