<div class="line_en">Sam soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with Frodo's account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the Company that set out from Rivendell; why he had left Boromir; and where he was now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur's Bane. Plainly he saw that Frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆很快就听出来，将军对于佛罗多在几个部分的交代感到不满意：他想要弄清楚佛罗多在从瑞文戴尔出发的远征队中，究竟扮演什么样的角色？为什么他会离开波罗莫？现在又准备前往何处？他也不停地针对埃西铎的克星反复质问，很明显，他认为佛罗多刻意隐藏一些重要的关键不让他知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke to find that it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back. He had brought many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope nearby, two or three hundred strong. They sat in a wide semicircle, between the arms of which Faramir was seated on the ground, while Frodo stood before him. It looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当山姆醒过来的时候，他以为自己只睡了几个小时，不过却惊讶地发现，时间不但已经到了下午，连法拉墨都已经回来了。他带了很多人一起回来，刚刚那场大战的幸存者，现在似乎都聚集在这个斜坡上，大约有两三百名。他们围成一个马蹄形，法拉墨坐在正中央，佛罗多站在他面前，看起来很像一场对囚犯的审判。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any attention to him, and he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear all that was going on. He watched and listened intently, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. He could see Faramir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆从树底下爬了出来，没有任何人注意到他，因此他找了队形的尽头坐了下来，刚好可以看见所有发生的事情。他专注地听着、看着，准备随时有需要就冲到主人身边去。他可以看见法拉墨的面孔，对方现在已经除下了面具；那是张严肃、拥有王者之气的面孔，而那双不断梭移的眼中也有着相当的智能。当他看向佛罗多的时候，灰眸中露出浓浓的疑惑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But it was at the coming of the Halfling that Isildur's Bane should waken, or so one must read the words," he insisted. "If then you are the Halfling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may be, to the Council of which you speak, and there Boromir saw it. Do you deny it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，从字面上来说，就是因为半身人的到来，埃西铎的克星才会再度苏醒，”他坚持道：“如果你就是诗中的半身人，毫无疑问的，你也将这样东西，不管它是什么，带到了那场会议中，波罗莫也看到了这样东西。我的这个推论有错吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo made no answer. "So!" said Faramir. "I wish then to learn from you more of it; for what concerns Boromir concerns me. An orc-arrow slew Isildur, so far as old tales tell. But orc-arrows are plenty, and the sight of one would not be taken as a sign of Doom by Boromir of Gondor. Had you this thing in keeping? It is hidden, you say; but is not that because you choose to hide it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多没有回答。“那么！”法拉墨说：“我希望从你那边知道更多有关它的事情。因为，波罗莫关切的事情和我关切的一样。至少在远古的传说中，杀死埃西铎的是半兽人的箭矢。但到处都可以看到半兽人的箭矢，光是这样的景象，并不会让刚铎的波罗莫认为末日将临。你随身携带这样东西吗？你说它还隐而未现，但是不是由于你选择要将它隐藏起来？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，这不是因为我的选择，”佛罗多回答：“这不是属于我的东西。不管强或弱，这东西都不属于任何的凡人；如果有任何人勉强可以担当这个重任，我会说他是亚拉冈，也就是远征队的队长。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="人群中开始窃窃私语，甚至有些人大喊着：“伊兰迪尔的圣剑！伊兰迪尔的圣剑来到了米那斯提力斯！风云将变！”但法拉墨依旧不为所动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe," he said. "But so great a claim will need to be established, and clear proofs will be required, should this Aragorn ever come to Minas Tirith. He had not come, nor any of your Company, when I set out six days ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧，”他说：“但这兹事体大，即使这位亚拉冈到了我邦，我们也必须要有更确切的证据才行。当我六天之前离开的时候，他或是你的任一位同伴，都没有来到米那斯提力斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Boromir was satisfied of that claim," said Frodo. "Indeed, if Boromir were here, he would answer all your questions. And since he was already at Rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the answers there. My part in the Company was known to him, as to all the others, for it was appointed to me by Elrond of Imladris himself before the whole Council. On that errand I came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the Company. Yet those who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“波罗莫可以接受我的说法，”佛罗多说：“如果波罗莫人在这里，他可以回答你的一切疑问。既然许多天前他就已经到了拉洛斯瀑布，并且准备直接前往你的城市；如果你回国，你可能很快就可以从他口中得知答案。我在远征队中的任务，是所有队员都知道的秘密，因为那是伊姆拉崔的爱隆在会议中公开指派给我的任务。为了执行那个任务，我必须来到这块土地，只是我奉命不能对任何远征队成员以外的人揭露这个任务。我只能说，任何抵抗魔王势力的善军，最好都不要阻碍我的工作。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vividly before Frodo's mind came the memory of Boromir's assault upon him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. "Boromir was a valiant member of our Company," said Frodo at length. "Yes, I was his friend, for my part."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多的脑海中，栩栩如生浮现了波罗莫抢夺魔戒的神情，他迟疑了片刻，法拉墨的眼神变得更凌厉了。“波罗莫是我们远征队中一位勇敢的队友，”佛罗多最后终于说：“是的，以我的角度来看，我的确是他的朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would grieve indeed," said Frodo. Then catching the look in Faramir's eyes, he faltered. "Dead?" he said. "Do you mean that he is dead, and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation. These last words were more than he could bear, and bursting into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆听着这对话，感到越来越不耐烦，越来越生气。最后一句话超过了他忍耐力的极限，因此他奋不顾身地冲进众人之中，站到主人身边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo," he said, "but this has gone on long enough. He's no right to talk to you so. After all you've gone through, as much for his good and all these great Men as for anyone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佛罗多先生，请容我插嘴，”他说：“但这已经浪费了够久的时间了，他没有资格对你这样说话。在你为了他们和其它人经历了这么多折磨之后，他更是不应该这样做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See here, Captain!" He planted himself squarely in front of Faramir, his hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit who had offered him what he called "sauce" when questioned about visits to the orchard. There was some murmuring, but also some grins on the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their Captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling with wrath, was one beyond their experience. "See here!" he said. "What are you driving at? Let's come to the point before all the Orcs of Mordor come down on us! If you think my master murdered this Boromir and then ran away, you've got no sense; but say it, and have done! And then let us know what you mean to do about it. But it's a pity that folk as talk about fighting the Enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got a new friend, he would."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，将军大人！”他抬头挺胸，双手插腰地站在法拉墨面前，脸上的表情彷佛是在教训一名年轻的哈比人，不该随便进入别人的果园一样。众人为此交头接耳，但有些人脸上也挂着诡异的笑容：他们可不常见到将军坐在地上，和一个气冲冲的哈比人面对面的景象。“听着！”他说：“你到底在暗示些什么？在魔多派出所有的半兽人猎杀我们之前，不如打开天窗说亮话吧！如果你认为我的主人杀死了波罗莫，然后逃离现场，那你脑袋一定坏掉了！但是，不管如何，至少说出你的想法！然后让我们知道你打算怎么做。我觉得很可惜，口口声声说要和魔王对抗的人，却不能够让其它人尽自己的一份义务。如果魔王可以看见目前的状况，他一定会很高兴的，搞不好还以为有了个新盟友呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam sat down heavily with a red face. Faramir turned to Frodo again. "You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of death have many wings. Night oft brings news to near kindred, "tis said. Boromir was my brother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆胀红着脸，一屁股坐下来。法拉墨再度转向佛罗多。“你刚刚问我怎么知道迪耐瑟的儿子去世了，死讯有许多种传递的方法，俗谚有云，夜风经常将消息传递给血亲──波罗莫是我的哥哥！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Patience!" said Faramir, but without anger. "Do not speak before your master, whose wit is greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach me of our peril. Even so, I spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a hard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago. For I am commanded to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of the Lord of Gondor. But I do not slay man or beast needlessly, and not gladly even when it is needed. Neither do I talk in vain. So be comforted. Sit by your master, and be silent!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有耐心点！”法拉墨不带怒气地说：“不要抢在你主人之前说话，因为他比你睿智多了，我也不需要任何人告诉我眼前的危险。即使这样，我还是空出时间来，希望能够在艰难的情况下作出公正判断。如果我和你一样急躁，可能早就把你给宰了；因为，我接受到的命令是杀无赦，完全不需要刚铎统治者的同意。但我不愿毫无意义的宰杀人类或是鸟兽，即使在必要的时候，我也不会感到任何的乐趣；同样的，我也不浪费时间在空谈上。不要担心，坐在你主人旁边，给我安静点！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A shadow of sorrow passed over his face. "Do you remember aught of special mark that the Lord Boromir bore with him among his gear?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo thought for a moment, fearing some further trap, and wondering how this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the Ring from the proud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men, warlike and strong, he did not know. Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though he was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both sterner and wiser. "I remember that Boromir bore a horn," he said at last.</div>

So do we ever watch the shores nigh Osgiliath, which our enemies now partly hold, and issue from it to harry our lands. But that night all the world slept at the midnight hour. Then I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a boat floating on the water, glimmering grey, a small boat of a strange fashion with a high prow, and there was none to row or steer it."</div>

And on the third night after another and a stranger thing befell me."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No more can I say than I have said," answered Frodo. "Though your tale fills me with foreboding.

<div class="line_en">"Yet how could such a thing have happened in truth?" asked Frodo. "For no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from Tol Brandir; and Boromir purposed to go home across the Entwash and the fields of Rohan. And yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools, though laden with water?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是这怎么可能会发生呢？”佛罗多问道：“没有任何船只可以通过托尔布兰达多岩的山区，而且波罗莫的提议是准备透过树沐河，再经过洛汗回到故乡。但是，怎么有可能会有船只通过一路上众多的瀑布和激流，安全抵达你当时所在的地方呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nay, it was not so," said Faramir. "For his works fill the heart with loathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You passed through the Hidden Land," said Faramir, "but it seems that you little understood its power. If Men have dealings with the Mistress of Magic who dwells in the Golden Wood, then they may look for strange things to follow. For it is perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of this Sun, and few of old came thence unchanged, this said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们通过了那隐藏的大地，”法拉墨说：“但是，看来你对它的力量并不了解。如果人类和黄金森林中的魔法女王打过交道，接下来可能会遇到意料之外的状况。因为根据传说，凡人踏进太阳照不到的世界是极端危险的，古代没有多少人离开的时候可以不受影响。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"From Lórien," said Frodo. "In three such boats we rowed down Anduin to the Falls. They also were of elven-work."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“波罗莫！喔，波罗莫！”他大喊着。“那不死的女王，她究竟对你说了些什么？她看见了什么？你的心中想起了什么？你为什么要去罗伦林多瑞安，却不照着你之前的计划，骑着洛汗的骏马回到家乡？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, I did not know of it," said Frodo. "But the day when you heard it blowing, if your reckoning is true, was the day when we parted, when I and my servant left the Company. And now your tale fills me with dread. For if Boromir was then in peril and was slain, I must fear that all my companions perished too. And they were my kindred and my friends."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我的确完全不知道，”佛罗多说：“但如果你没有听错的话，号角响起的那一天，就是我和我的仆人离开远征队的那一天。你刚刚所说的故事让我十分的害怕。因为，如果当时波罗莫身陷险境，最后甚至阵亡的话，我很担心其它伙伴是否也遭遇了不幸？他们都是我一同出生入死的好友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then turning again to Frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice once more. "To those questions I guess that you could make some answer, Frodo son of Drogo. But not here or now, maybe. But lest you still should think my tale a vision, I will tell you this. The horn of Boromir at least returned in truth, and not in seeming. The horn came, but it was cloven in two, as it were by axe or sword. The shards came severally to shore: one was found among the reeds where watchers of Gondor lay, northwards below the infalls of the Entwash; the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an errand on the water. Strange chances, but murder will out, this said. And now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of Denethor, sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. And you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of the horn?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他又转过身面对佛罗多，再度用低沉的声音说话。“德罗哥之子佛罗多，我想这些疑问你都应该可以解答才是，但或许不在此时此地。不过，如果你还是认为我所见所闻只是幻影，那么我可以告诉你这件事。波罗莫的号角真真实实的回到了他的家乡，绝对不是幻影。号角漂流到岸边，但却彷佛被斧头或是长剑砍成两半，一半是在刚铎守望者驻防的地方被发现的，那是在树沐河会流之地的北方；另外一半则是被有任务在身的人在河中发现的。看起来非常巧合，但根据古谚，枉死者不会让自己冤沉大海的。此刻，长子代代相传的号角之碎片，正在迪耐瑟王的膝盖上，而他坐在宝座上等待新的消息。你难道对这号角破碎的消息一点也不知情吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But whatever befell on the North March, you, Frodo, I doubt no longer. If hard days have made me any judge of Men's words and faces, then I may make a guess at Halflings! Though," and now he smiled, "there is something strange about you, Frodo, an Elvish air, maybe. But more lies upon our words together than I thought at first. I should now take you back to Minas Tirith to answer there to Denethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if I now choose a course that proves ill for my city. So I will not decide in haste what is to be done. Yet we must move hence without more delay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，不管他们遭遇到了什么样的命运，佛罗多，我都已经不再对你有所怀疑。如果这些艰苦的日子让我拥有判断人心的能力，那么或许我也能够推断半身人的想法。不过──”他露出了久违的笑容：“佛罗多，你有种奇怪的气质，或许是精灵的味道吧，但是，你似乎比我一开始所想的还要承担更多的责任。我应该把你带回米那斯提力斯，接受我王的裁判。可是，如果我作出了错误的选择，可能会连累到我城邦的命运，因此，我不能够在仓促中决定。不过，我们又不能够在此继续拖延。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For me there is no comfort in our speech together," said Faramir; "but you surely draw from it more dread than need be.

<div class="line_en">There was nothing for Frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of Gondor had made a journey in Ithilien more dangerous than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多别无选择，只能服从这个要求或是变相的命令。至少目前看起来，这是个还算合理的作法，因为这群刚铎战士刚刚的所做所为，已经让伊西立安曝露在高度危险中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now you, Frodo and Samwise, will come with me and my guards," said Faramir. "You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. It will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet. And you cannot, I think, go far today in any case, for you are weary. And so are we. We are going now to a secret place we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. The Orcs and spies of the Enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even against many. There we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. In the morning I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“轮到你们两位了，佛罗多和山姆卫斯，你们两位和我以及两名护卫一起走，”法拉墨说：“如果你们计划往南走，现在也不能够继续走那条路了。这条路在今后好几天之内都会非常危险，在我们执行了这次突袭之后，此地会受到更严密的监控。我想，既然你们今天都已经相当疲倦，恐怕也不能够再往前走多远了，我们要前往距离此地大约十哩左右的秘密藏身处。半兽人和魔王的间谍，截至目前为止还没找到那个地方，即使他们发现了该处，我们也能够在那边以寡击众固守很长的时间。你们可以和我们一起在那边休息一段时间，到了早上，我会决定你和我该怎么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I broke off our speech together," said Faramir, "not only because time pressed, as Master Samwise had reminded me, but also because we were drawing near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men. It was for that reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be Isildur's Bane. You were not wholly frank with me, Frodo."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我之所以会中断那段谈话，”法拉墨说：“并不只是因为山姆先生提醒我的时间紧迫，同时也是因为我们讨论的话题，已经无法在众人面前公开交谈了。是因为这个原因，我才不再追问兄长的状况以及埃西铎克星的详情。佛罗多，你并没有完全说实话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They set out at once: Mablung and Damrod a little ahead, and Faramir with Frodo and Sam behind. Skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards. While they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们立刻就出发，马伯龙和丹姆拉打前锋，法拉墨和佛罗多及山姆则走在后头。他们绕过了哈比人之前盥洗的池子，越过了小溪，爬过一段斜坡，进入森林中，一直往下坡和往西方前进。当他们以哈比人最快的步伐前进的时候，照旧压低声音交谈着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not blame you," said Faramir. "You spoke with skill in a hard place, and wisely, it seemed to me. But I learned or guessed more from you than your words said. You were not friendly with Boromir, or you did not part in friendship. You, and Master Samwise, too, I guess have some grievance. Now I loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet I knew him well. Isildur's Bane -- I would hazard that Isildur's Bane lay between you and was a cause of contention in your Company. Clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among confederates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. Do I not hit near the mark?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不怪你，”法拉墨说：“就我看来，你在困境中依旧相当有技巧地传达了部分的事实，不过，我还是从你没有说出口的话语中猜到了不少。你和波罗莫的关系不怎么好，或者是你们离开的时候起了冲突，你，和山姆卫斯先生都一样，我想可能有些不愉快。虽然我十分敬爱他，也很想要为他复仇，但我很了解他的为人。埃西铎克星，我推测它就在你的身上，也是你们远征队彼此猜忌的原因。很明显它是某种强而有力的物品，而这样的东西在盟友之间并不会促进双方的友谊，万一有一方从古代的传说中得知了真相就更是如此。我的猜测是否很接近了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Near," said Frodo, "but not in the gold. There was no contention in our Company, though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from the Emyn Muil. But be that as it may, ancient tales teach us also the peril of rash words concerning such things as -- heirlooms."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确很接近，”佛罗多说：“但并不完全正确。远征队中没有猜忌，但的确有犹豫不决：我们不确定在离开了爱明莫尔之后该走哪条路。不过，即使是这样，古代的传说也告诉我们不要仓促的评断这──物品。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur's Bane. Forgive me! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for thought. We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But even as I spoke with you, I drew nearer to the mark, and so deliberately shot wider. For you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore among the Rulers of the city that is not spread abroad. We of my house are not of the line of Elendil, though the blood of Númenor is in us. For we reckon back our line to Mardil, the good steward, who ruled in the king's stead when he went away to war. And that was King Eärnur, last of the line of Anárion, and childless, and he came never back. And the stewards have governed the city since that day, though it was many generations of Men ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，佛罗多，请原谅我一开始这么急躁地逼问你有关埃西铎克星的事情，在此时此地实在不太适合，我当时没有时间思考。我们刚打了一场艰苦的战斗，我脑中乱糟糟的。不过，当我和你交谈的时候，虽然我越来越逼近真相，最后我却刻意地避开了主题。虽然我们家族的人拥有努曼诺尔人的血统，但并非伊兰迪尔的直系子孙，我们的血统直溯自马迪尔，他是当时的宰相，在国王御驾亲征的时候担任摄政王，代理朝政。那位国王是伊亚诺，安那瑞安的最后血脉，而且他死时膝下无子。因此，从那天以后，宰相就开始继承了该城的王位，那已经是许多代以前的故事了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, then it is as I thought: your trouble was with Boromir alone. He wished this thing brought to Minas Tirith. Alas! it is a crooked fate that seals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that which I long to know: what was in his heart and thought in his latest hours. Whether he erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His face was more beautiful even than in life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，那么果然和我所想的一样：你所遭遇到的争执仅限于波罗莫身上，他希望能够把这个东西带到米那斯提力斯去。真是遗憾！命运让你无法告诉我期待已久的真相，也让我无法从最后一个见到他的人口中探索事实：他生命中的最后一刻到底在想些什么。不管他之前是否犯了错，但我知道一件事：他没有白白牺牲，死前的努力至少让他可以瞑目，他脸上的表情比生前的任何时刻都要安祥。”">查看中文翻译</div>

We in the house of Denethor know much ancient lore by long tradition, and there are moreover in our treasuries many things preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone, and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some none can now read; and for the rest, few ever unlock them. I can read a little in them, for I have had teaching. It was these records that brought the Grey Pilgrim to us.

This Mithrandir was, I now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time. Had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger. Yet, maybe, he would not have done so, and the journey of Boromir was doomed. Mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal his purposes. He got leave of Denethor, how I do not know, to look at the secrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach (and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us above all else concerning the Great Battle that was fought upon Dagorlad in the beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was overthrown.

<div class="line_en">"What in truth this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of power and peril it must be. A fell weapon, perchance, devised by the Dark Lord. If it were a thing that gave advantage in battle, I can well believe that Boromir, the proud and fearless, often rash, ever anxious for the victory of Minas Tirith (and his own glory therein), might desire such a thing and be allured by it. Alas that ever he went on that errand! I should have been chosen by my father and the elders, but he put himself forward, as being the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed."</div>

Here I thought was the answer to Mithrandir's questioning. But it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated among us, did I think of Isildur's Bane as being this same thing.

<div class="line_en">Frodo made no answer. Almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, all that was in his mind. But something held him back. His heart was heavy with fear and sorrow: if he and Sam were indeed, as seemed likely, all that was now left of the Nine Walkers, then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand. Better mistrust undeserved than rash words. And the memory of Boromir, of the dreadful change that the lure of the Ring had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them. One thing he had noted, that in all the talk the name of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it again. He soon became aware also that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not only Damrod and Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others on either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆完全没有介入这次的对话，他只是静静地倾听着，同时，他也利用哈比人良好的听力分析着四周的一切声响。他注意到一件事情，在这整段交谈的过程中，咕鲁这个名字一次也没有出现过。他很高兴，只不过，他并不敢奢望这个名字会从此永远消失。他很快就注意到，虽然他们只有三个人走在一起，但附近还有许多其它的人类：不只是丹姆拉和马伯龙在阴影中穿梭，还有其它的人在附近游走，全都是以各自不同的路线前往同样一个地点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began to fall more steeply. Then they turned aside again, to the right, and came quickly to a small river in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that trickled far above out of the round pool, now grown to a swift torrent, leaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed, overhung with ilex and dark box-woods. Looking west they could see, below them in a haze of light, lowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide waters of the Anduin.</div>

<div class="line_en">With green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes, and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each one by the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of this last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders. Now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while, and then set down again. Always the noise of the running water was on their right hand, and it grew nearer and louder. At length they were halted. Quickly Mablung and Damrod turned them about, several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed upwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. Then they were picked up and carried down, down many steps, and round a corner. Suddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. All round them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. At last they were set on their feet once more. For a moment they stood so, half fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke.</div>

The level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it, and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever-changing colour.

<div class="line_en">Even as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water. They turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. At once they found themselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven stooping roof. A few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls. Many men were already there. Others were still coming in by twos and threes through a dark narrow door on one side. As their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled with great store of arms and victuals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他说话的时候，太阳已经落下，流水中的火焰也跟着慢慢地消逝。他们转过身，进入低矮的拱门，立刻发现自己进入了一个石制的大厅，又宽又广，连屋顶都高低不平。潮湿的墙壁上插着几支点燃的火把，让室内充满着微弱的光芒，其它人则是三三两两的从另一边的窄门走进来。当哈比人的眼睛习惯这黑暗之后，他们发现洞穴比之前想象大得多了，里面装满了各式各样的补给和武器。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, here is our refuge," said Faramir. "Not a place of great ease, but here you may pass the night in peace. It is dry at least, and there is food, though no fire. At one time the water flowed down through this cave and out of the arch, but its course was changed further up the gorge, by workmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above. All the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entry of water or aught else, all save one. There are now but two ways out: that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold, and through the Window-curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of stone. Now rest a while, until the evening meal is set."</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on, if they wished. Meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in orderly quickness. Light tables were taken from the walls and set up on trestles and laden with gear. This was plain and unadorned for the most part, but all well and fairly made: round platters, bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean.

<div class="line_en">"Well, no, lord," said the man. "No Orc at least. But I saw, or thought I saw, something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk, when the eyes make things greater than they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel." Sam pricked up his ears at this. "Yet if so, it was a black squirrel, and I saw no tail. It was like a shadow on the ground, and it whisked behind a tree-trunk when I drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any squirrel could. You will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose, and it seemed no more, so I tried no arrow. It was too dark for sure shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling. But I stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then I hastened back. I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I turned away. A large squirrel, maybe. Perhaps under the shadow of the Unnamed some of the beasts of Mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods. They have black squirrels there, this said."</div>

<div class="line_en">"So we always do," he said, as they sat down: "we look towards Númenor that was, and beyond to Elvenhome that is, and to that which is beyond Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat?"</div>

<div class="line_en">When all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought there. A little earthenware lamp burned in a niche.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在用餐完毕之后，法拉墨带领两人来到洞穴后一个比较隐密的空间里面，借着一道廉幕和外面隔开。此地安放了一张椅子和两张凳子，壁龛中放着一盏粘土烧制的油灯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Frodo, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. "But if we are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have eaten we rise and thank him."</div>

<div class="line_en">After so long journeying and camping, and days spent in the lonely wild, the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to drink pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and dried fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates. Neither Frodo nor Sam refused anything that was offered, nor a second, nor indeed a third helping. The wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land of Lórien.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在经过这么长的野外旅行和扎营，以及在荒野中独处了那么久的时间之后，这顿饭对哈比人来说像是难得的大餐。他们可以饮用冰凉、香气四溢的醇黄美酒，可以吃着面包和奶油，享受腌肉和干果，以及上好的红色乳酪，而且可以使用干净的刀叉和碟子，或是以双手享用这一切。佛罗多和山姆对所有的食物都照单全收，第一份、第二份，甚至是第三份都是如此。美酒流入他们的血管和疲倦的四肢，自从离开罗瑞安之后，他们很久没有这么轻松的感觉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part Boromir had played in all their adventures, with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under Caradhras, and in the mines of Moria where Gandalf fell. Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多描述了整段旅程中的许多经历，不过，他总是会在关键时刻，把故事带离远征队的任务和魔戒，同时，还刻意强调波罗莫在这趟冒险中的英勇事迹，包括在对抗荒野的恶狼时、在高山上和暴风雪搏斗时，在甘道夫丧生的摩瑞亚矿坑中。法拉墨对于桥上的一战极为动容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam was beaming and humming to himself, but when Frodo spoke he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多不再觉得昏昏欲睡，反而很想要和大家聊聊天。不过，虽然食物和美酒让他放松下来，但并没有让他丧失警觉性。山姆自顾自地哼着歌，在佛罗多开口之后，起初他只是甘愿于倾听，偶尔会发出同意的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You may soon desire to sleep," he said, "and especially good Samwise, who would not close his eyes before he ate -- whether for fear of blunting the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not know. But it is not good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. Let us talk a while. On your journey from Rivendell there must have been many things to tell. And you, too, would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the lands where you now are. Tell me of Boromir my brother, and of old Mithrandir, and of the fair people of Lothlórien."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们可能很快又会昏昏欲睡了，”他说：“特别是这位山姆魏斯先生，他在吃饭前连眼都没闭，我不知道他是为了不好意思，还是为了担心我的一举一动。不过，刚吃过饭就睡觉，中间还隔很长一段时间无法用餐对身体实在不好。我们先聊聊天吧！你们从瑞文戴尔一路到这边来，中间一定有很多的故事可以和我分享，或许你们也愿意倾听有关这块土地的故事。告诉我有关波罗莫、苍老的米斯兰达，罗斯洛立安美丽的居民的故事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What hope have we?" said Faramir. "It is long since we had any hope. The sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but I do not think that it will do more than put off the evil day, unless other help unlooked-for also comes, from Elves or Men. For the Enemy increases and we decrease. We are a failing people, a springless autumn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们有什么希望？”法拉墨回答：“从很久以前我们就不抱持希望了，如果伊兰迪尔的圣剑重临，或许可以协助我们重拾希望；但是，除非精灵或是人类的援军到来，否则那也只不过是昙花一现而已。因为敌长我消，我们是个人口不断减少的民族，是个已经步入秋天的国度。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Death was ever present, because the Númenóreans still, as they had in their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life unchanging. Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living, and counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in secret chambers withered men compounded strong elixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the stars. And the last king of the line of Anárion had no heir."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“死亡之气四处蔓延，因为努曼诺尔人的家乡虽然毁灭了，但是他们依旧渴求着万世不变的永生不死。国王建造着比生者住宅还要豪华的陵墓，对于古代的先祖名讳，记忆得比自己子孙之名还要清楚。毫无子嗣的国王枯坐在衰败的王宫中，思索着继承人的问题，在密室中衰老的人们试验着强效的不死药，或是在高而寒冷的塔中观测星象，而安诺瑞安一系的国王，没有留下任何的血脉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Yet even so it was Gondor that brought about its own decay, falling by degrees into dotage, and thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of our lore and manners they have learned what they would, and their lords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold by the ways of their own fathers and to their own memories, and they speak among themselves their own North tongue. And we love them: tall men and fair women, valiant both alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed, and strong; they remind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the Elder Days. Indeed it is said by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from those same Three Houses of Men as were the Númenóreans in their beginning; not from Hador the Goldenhaired, the Elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his people as went not over Sea into the West, refusing the call."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们从我们的历史和文化中尽可能地学习，在必要的时候，他们的王族也会使用我们的语言。不过，在大多数的状况下他们还是坚持祖先的文化和记忆，使用自己的北方语言。我们和他们一直十分友好，他们是高壮的男子和美丽的女子，都同样的骁勇善战，金色头发、明亮的双眸，勇气十足的民族。他们让我们想起了远古时候，人类活力十足的初民。根据我们的历史记载，这些骠骑们的确和我们拥有相关连的血缘，他们的祖先也和努曼诺尔人一样是来自于人类最早的三个家族，不是金发哈多，或许是精灵之友。他的子嗣拒绝听从主神的召唤，留在这块大陆上，没有渡海前往西方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So it came to pass in the days of Cirion the Twelfth Steward (and my father is the six and twentieth) that they rode to our aid and at the great Field of Celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern provinces. These are the Rohirrim, as we name them, masters of horses, and we ceded to them the fields of Calenardhon that are since called Rohan; for that province had long been sparsely peopled. And they became our allies, and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our northern marches and the Gap of Rohan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因此，到了第十二代宰相西立安的年代时（我父则是第二十六代），他们骑马前来援助我们在赛勒布兰特上的血战，消灭了侵占我们北方省分的敌人。他们就是洛汗人，牧马王，我们将该处的疆土分封给他们，并且将那边改名为洛汗国，因为那里本来就是我帝国中地广人稀的一个省分。他们就成了我们的忠实盟友，对我们一直十分的支持，只要我们有需要，他们就会前来支持；同时，他们也协助我们守卫北方边境和洛汗隘口这个要冲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But the stewards were wiser and more fortunate. Wiser, for they recruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea-coast, and from the hardy mountaineers of Ered Nimrais.

<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，宰相们相形之下却显得更为睿智、更为幸运。睿智，是因为他们从海岸边征召我族中活跃的血族，也从山脉中找寻饱经历练的同胞。他们和北方骄傲的民族签下了和约，他们虽然经常攻击我们，却是自傲、勇敢的民族，也和我们之间有着远亲的关系，和野蛮的东方人或是残酷的哈拉德人完全不同。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“因此在我们的历史记载中，就将人类分成了上民，西方之人，也就是努曼诺尔人；以及中民，曙光之民，也就是洛汗人和他们依旧居住在北方大地的同胞；最后就是野民，黑暗之人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yet now, if the Rohirrim are grown in some ways more like to us, enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too have become more like to them, and can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle Men, of the Twilight, but with memory of other things. For as the Rohirrim do, we now love war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end; and though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a warrior, nonetheless, above men of other crafts. Such is the need of our days. So even was my brother, Boromir: a man of prowess, and for that he was accounted the best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of Minas Tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil, so onward into battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn." Faramir sighed and fell silent for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，就如同洛汗人变得更文明、更温和的同时，我们也变得更像他们，再也无法声称自己是什么上民了。我们也成为了所谓的中民，曙光之民，但却还拥有别的记忆。因此，我们虽然和骠骑们一样热爱战争和荣誉，以及任何本身良善的事物，它们算是种磨练，也是种手段；我们却也依旧认为战士不应该只知道杀戮和使用武器，但也照样最推崇战士，因为这是我们在这黑暗时代中的需求。我的哥哥波罗莫，是骁勇的战士，也是刚铎的第一勇士；米那斯提力斯已经有许久没有这么勇敢、身先士卒的战士了，也没有人能够像他那样吹响皇家的号角。”法拉墨叹了口气，陷入沉默中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No indeed, Master Samwise," said Faramir, "for I am not learned in Elven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, declining from Númenor to Middle-earth. For as you may know, if Mithrandir was your companion and you have spoken with Elrond, the Edain, the Fathers of the Númenóreans, fought beside the Elves in the first wars, and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of Elvenhome. But in Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days of darkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which each kind walked further down their sundered roads. Men now fear and misdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And we of Gondor grow like other Men, like the men of Rohan; for even they, who are foes of the Dark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of the Golden Wood with dread."</div>

It ought to be sung. You'd have to get Strider, Aragorn that is, or old Mr. Bilbo, for that. But I wish I could make a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender like. Hard as di'monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight, cold as frost in the stars.

<div class="line_en">"Alas for Boromir! It was too sore a trial!" he said. "How you have increased my sorrow, you two strange wanderers from a far country, bearing the peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of Halflings. We are truth-speakers, we men of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die in the attempt. Not if I found it on the highway would I take it I said. Even if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those words as a vow, and be held by them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对波罗莫来说真是太严酷了！这是太严苛的考验了！”他说：“我的心情变得更沉重了，你们两位远方的旅人，竟然背负着人类的重担！可惜的是，你们对于人类的判断力并没有我对于半身人一样的准确。刚铎都是言出必行的人。我们极少开口，但只要誓言一出，我们就会谨守诺言，死而后已。我之前说过，就算在路边发现它，我也不愿拿走它，即使我渴望这拥有无比力量的物品，就算我当时并不知道它是什么，但我也会把这句话当作誓言，谨守我的承诺。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough to know that there are some perils from which a man must flee. Sit at peace! And be comforted, Samwise. If you seem to have stumbled, think that it was fated to be so. Your heart is shrewd as well as faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes. For strange though it may seem, it was safe to declare this to me. It may even help the master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is in my power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once is enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我并不是利欲熏心的人，或者这么说，我知道有些危险是人类必须躲避的。安心坐下！山姆魏斯，不要担心，如果你刚刚是不小心说漏了嘴，就把它当作命运的安排吧。你的那颗心不只忠诚，更刁钻精明，看得比你的那双眼睛要清楚。或许你现在会觉得很奇怪，但这件事情让我知道却是毫无影响的，甚至对于你最敬爱的主人是有帮助的，如果在我的能力范围之内，我甚至可以给予他协助。不要担心，但是，也请你不要再提到这东西了，一次就够了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. There was a silence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder. But Faramir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietly, and then suddenly became grave again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多和山姆从凳子上跳了起来，背靠着墙并排地站着，摸索着他们的剑柄。一片寂静。山洞里所有的人都停止了说话，惊奇地看着他们。但法拉墨又坐在椅子上，开始安静地笑起来，然后突然又变得严肃起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. Men turned back to their drink and their talk, perceiving that their captain had had some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人回到座位上，非常安静地坐着。人们重新又转回头去吃吃喝喝，以为刚刚将军和小客人们聊得太起劲了，现在已经恢复了平静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another," said Faramir. "If you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have pity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to keep it hid and not to use it. You are a new people and a new world to me. Are all your kin of like sort? Your land must be a realm of peace and content, and there must gardeners be in high honour."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，佛罗多，我们终于对彼此都开诚布公了，”法拉墨说：“如果你是由于其它人的要求，才不情愿地收下这东西，那么我对你致上敬意及同情；而且，我也对于你竟然能够拥有这种自制力，可以将它收起来而不去用它，也感到十分敬佩。对我来说，你代表了一个全新的种族，更带来了一个全新的世界。你的同胞们都像你一样吗？那么你的国度一定是个和平安祥的地方，园丁在那边一定极受尊敬。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not all is well there," said Frodo, "but certainly gardeners are honoured."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们那里并不是天堂，”佛罗多说；“但的确很尊敬园丁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all things under the Sun of this world. And you are far from home and wayworn. No more tonight. Sleep, both of you -- in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do not wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of it than I know (which is enough), lest peril perchance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than Frodo son of Drogo. Go now to rest -- but first tell me only, if you will, whither you wish to go, and what to do. For I must watch, and wait, and think. Time passes. In the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，即使在花园里面，人们也一定会觉得疲倦的，就像是这世界上的所有生物一样。你又离家很远，疲惫不堪，今晚就聊到这里为止，睡吧，两位，把握时间好好休息，不要担心！我不想要看它、碰触它，甚至是更了解它（我目前所知道的就已经够了），否则那危险将会尾随着我，可能让我在考验中败给佛罗多先生。两位可以尽管休息──不过，如果你们愿意的话，在那之前，请先告诉我你们想去哪里，要做些什么。因为我必须观察、等待和周详的思考。时间过得很快，明天一早，我们就必须赶快前往指定的会合地点。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him to the bed and laid him there, and covered him warmly. At once he fell into a deep sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法拉墨极为惊讶地打量着他。然后，突然间，法拉墨抱住摇摇晃晃的佛罗多，温柔地将他抱起，并且将他放在小床上，替他盖好被子，他立刻就陷入了深深的沉睡中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another bed was set beside him for his servant. Sam hesitated for a moment, then bowing very low: "Good night, Captain, my lord," he said. "You took the chance, sir."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旁边的另外一张床是给他的仆人睡的。山姆迟疑了片刻，然后深深一鞠躬：“晚安，将军大人，”他说：“大人，你接受了考验。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. Now a great weariness came down on him like a cloud. He could dissemble and resist no longer. "I was going to find a way into Mordor," he said faintly. "I was going to Gorgoroth. I must find the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing into the gulf of Doom. Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall ever get there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然起初的震惊已经过去了，但佛罗多还是觉得自己在微微地发抖，他突然间觉得自己的双肩彷佛有千斤般沉重，他已经没有办法再强打起精神了。“我得要找条路进入魔多，”他用微弱的声音说：“我准备要前往葛哥洛斯盆地，我必须要找到火之山，并且将这东西丢进末日裂隙中。甘道夫是这样告诉我的，我不认为我有能力到达那里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Faramir smiled. "A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards. Yet there was naught in this to praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法拉墨笑了：“山姆魏斯先生，你真是个唐突的仆人，不过，我还是认为有德者的称赞是最值得珍惜的。不过，您的赞美其实对我没有多大的意义，因为我本来就没有受到任何的引诱或是有冲动做出别的决定。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，大人，你也证实了你的人格是最高洁的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah well, sir," said Sam, "you said my master had an Elvish air; and that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of -- well, Gandalf, of wizards."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，好吧，大人，”山姆说：“你说过我的主人有种精灵的气质，你的看法很正确。请容我补上一句，你也有种特殊的气质，大人。这让我想起，想起──好吧，巫师甘道夫。”">查看中文翻译</div>
