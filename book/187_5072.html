<div class="line_en">Fop, a long time they could not speak nor even shed a tear. Then the Unicorn stamped the ground with his hoof, and shook his mane, and spoke. "Sire," he said, "there is now no need of counsel. We see that the Ape's plans were laid deeper than we dreamed of. Doubtless he has been long in secret traffic with The Tisroc, and as soon as he had found the lion-skin he sent him word to make ready his navy for the taking of Cair Paravel and all Narnia. Nothing now remains for us seven but to go back to Stable Hill, proclaim the truth, and take the adventure that Aslan sends us. And if, by a great marvel, we defeat those thirty Calormenes who are with the Ape, then to turn again and die in battle with the far greater host of them that will soon march from Cair Paravel."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nay," said the King, "you loosed me from the tree: you glided before me like a snake last night in the wood and took Puzzle: and you, Eustace, killed your man. But you are too young to share in such a bloody end as we others must meet tonight or, it may be, three days hence. I entreat you -- nay, I command you -- to return to your own place. I should be put to shame if I let such young warriors fall in battle on my side."</div>

<div class="line_en">The King's first idea was that they should not go back to Stable Hill -- they were sick of the very name of it by now till after dark. But the Dwarf told them that if they arrived there by daylight they would probably find the place deserted, except perhaps for a Calormene sentry. The Beasts were far too frightened by what the Ape (and Ginger) had told them about this new angry Aslan -- or Tashlan -- to go near it except when they were called together for these horrible midnight meetings. And Calormenes are never good woodsmen. Poggin thought that even by daylight they could easily get round to somewhere behind the stable without being seen. This would be much harder to do when the night had come and the Ape might be calling the Beasts together and all the Calormenes were on duty. And when the meeting did begin they could leave Puzzle at the back of the stable, completely out of sight, till the moment at which they wanted to produce him. This was obviously a good thing: for their only chance was to give the Narnians a sudden surprise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王第一个主意是不到天黑以后，他们不应该回到马厩山去——现在他们听到这山的名字就感到厌恶了。但小矮人告诉他们，如果他们在白天到达山上，他们就很可能发现那儿寂无人影，也许只碰到个把警卫。野兽们被无尾猿（和金格）所告诉它们的阿斯兰——或塔什兰——的新的愤怒吓坏了，它们不敢走近马厩去，除非被叫去开那些可怕的午夜大会。卡乐门人从来不是善于在森林里活动的好手。波金认为，在白天里他们倒容易绕到马厩山背后的什么地方，不会被人看见的。黑夜来临，无尾猿就要把野兽召集拢来，所有的卡乐门兵都要值班上岗，那时倒难办得多。大会开始时，他们可以把迷惑留在马~背后，藏得完全看不见，直到他们要牵它出来示众。这显然是件好事；因为他们惟一取胜的机会，就在于突然叫纳尼亚野兽们意想不到地大吃一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Tirian realized that the two strangers could not get home (unless Aslan suddenly whisked them away), he next wanted them to go across the Southern mountains into Archenland where they might possibly be safe. But they didn't know their way and there was no one to send with them. Also, as Poggin said, once the Calormenes had Narnia they would certainly take Archenland in the next week or so: The Tisroc had always wanted to have these Northern countries for his own. In the end Eustace and Jill begged so hard that Tirian said they could come with him and take their chance -- or, as he much more sensibly called it, "the adventure that Aslan would send them".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当蒂莲明白了两个陌生人无法回家（除非阿斯兰突然把他们带走），他第二步棋就是要他们穿过南部崇山峻岭进入阿钦兰，说不定那儿可能安全些。但他们不认识路，也派不出人陪他们去。正如波金所指出的，一旦卡乐门军队占据了纳尼亚，他们大约在第二个星期里就一定会攻占阿钦兰“蒂斯罗克”始终要并吞这些北方国家，占为己有。最后，尤斯塔斯和吉尔苦苦恳求。蒂莲便说他们可以跟他—起去碰碰机会——或者，一如他更加明智地所说的“冒冒阿斯兰给他们送来的风“。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While Jill and Eustace were talking about this, the others were discussing their plans and becoming less miserable. That was because they were now thinking of what was to be done this very night and the thought of what had happened to Narnia -- the thought that all her glories and joys were over -- was pushed away into the back part of their minds. The moment they stopped talking it would come out and make them wretched again: but they kept on talking. Poggin was really quite cheerful about the night's work they had to do. He was sure that the Boar and the Bear, and probably all the Dogs would come over to their side at once. And he couldn't believe that all the other Dwarfs would stick to Griffle. And fighting by firelight and in and out among trees would be an advantage to the weaker side. And then, if they could win tonight, need they really throw their lives away by meeting the main Calormene army a few days later?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔和尤斯塔斯正谈起这档子事时，其他的伙伴正在讨论计划，变得不太痛苦了。因为他们现在正想的是今夜必须干的事情——而纳尼亚遭到了什么灾难、纳尼亚的光荣和欢乐都过去了等等的思想，都被推到头脑的后半部去了。他们停止谈话时，那些思想就会冒出来使他们重新感到痛苦；但他们继续不断地谈着话。对于夜间他们非干不可的活儿，波金确实感到十分高兴。他深信野猪和熊，可能所有的狗儿，都会立刻站在他们这一边来的。他也无法相信所有其他的小矮人们都会依附格里夫尔。在火光旁作战，出没于树木之间，对于力量较弱的一方是有利的。而且，如果今夜他们能获胜，几天以后，他们果真还需要为迎战卡乐门主力部队而牺牲他们的生命吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Why not hide in the woods, or even up in the Western Waste beyond the great waterfall and live like outlaws? And then they might gradually get stronger and stronger, for Talking Beasts and Archenlanders would be joining them every day. And at last they'd come out of hiding and sweep the Calormenes (who would have got careless by then) out of the country and Narnia would be revived. After all, something very like that had happened in the time of King Miraz!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么不躲藏在森林里，甚至跑到大瀑布外的西部荒原，像逃亡者一样生活呢？然后他们便可能逐渐强大更强大，因为会说人话的野兽和阿钦兰人每天都会来参加他们的队伍。最后他们便将从躲藏之地突然冒出来，把卡乐门士兵（那时他们会疏忽大意了）扫荡出他们的国家，而纳尼亚便可复兴。在国王弥若兹的时代，类似这样的事情毕竟是发生过的！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they got nearer to Stable Hill of course everyone became quiet. Then the real wood-work began. From the moment at which they first saw the Hill to the moment at which they all arrived at the back of the stable, it took them over two hours. It's the sort of thing one couldn't describe properly unless one wrote pages and pages about it. The journey from each bit of cover to the next was a separate adventure, and there were very long waits in between, and several false alarms. If you are a good Scout or a good Guide you will know already what it must have been like. By about sunset they were all safe in a clump of holly trees about fifteen yards behind the stable. They all munched some biscuit and lay down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走得更靠近马厩山时，大家当然都默不作声。于是，真正的林中活动开始了。从他们第一次望见马厩山那一刻起，到他们大家都来到马腹背后那一刻为止，他们花了两个多钟头的时间。这个过程是无法恰当描写的，除非记下一页页的流水账。从每一个掩蔽处到下一个掩蔽处都是一段又一段的冒险，其间还有漫长的等待和好几次虚惊。如果你是个优秀的侦察员或是优秀的向导，你就已经知道这必定是什么情况了。太阳快落下去时，他们大家都安全进入一丛冬青树里，在马厩背后大约十五码光景。他们大家都吃些饼干，在地上躺下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then came the worst part, the waiting. Luckily for the children they slept for a couple of hours, but of course they woke up when the night grew cold, and what was worse, woke up very thirsty and with no chance of getting a drink. Puzzle just stood, shivering a little with nervousness, and said nothing. But Tirian, with his head against Jewel's flank, slept as soundly as if he were in his royal bed at Cair Paravel, till the sound of a gong beating awoke him and he sat up and saw that there was firelight on the far side of the stable and knew that the hour had come.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bonfire had not been lit for long and was just beginning to blaze up. It was only a few feet away from them, and the great crowd of Narnian creatures were on the other side of it, so that Tirian could not at first see them very well, though of course he saw dozens of eyes shining with the reflection of the fire, as you've seen a rabbit's or cat's eyes in the headlights of a car. And just as Tirian took his place, the gong stopped beating and from somewhere on his left three figures appeared. One was Rishda Tarkaan the Calormene Captain. The second was the Ape. He was holding on to the Tarkaan's hand with one paw and kept whimpering and muttering, "Not so fast, don't go so fast, I'm not at all well. Oh my poor head! These midnight meetings are getting too much for me. Apes aren't meant to be up at night: It's not as if I was a rat or a bat -- oh my poor head." On the other side of the Ape, walking very soft and stately, with his tail straight up in the air, came Ginger the Cat. They were heading for the bonfire and were so close to Tirian that they would have seen him at once if they had looked in the right direction. Fortunately they did not. But Tirian heard Rishda say to Ginger in a low voice: "Now, Cat, to thy post. See thou play thy part well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="篝火才点亮不久，正好开始熊熊燃烧起来。篝火离他们不过几英尺光景，而一大群纳尼亚野兽都在篝火的那一边，所以蒂莲开头看不大清楚，当然他看见十几双眼睛在篝火的反光里闪闪发亮，就像你在汽车前灯的灯光里看到的野兔或猫的眼睛一般。蒂莲刚站定位置，锣声便停了，三个黑影儿从他左边一个地方冒出来了。一个是利什达泰坎，卡乐门队长。第二个是无尾猿，它的一个前爪给抓在泰坎手里，它不断地呜咽、咕哝“不要这样快，别走得这样快，我身体压根儿不好。唉，我可怜的脑袋好疼啊！这些午夜大会我愈来愈吃不消了。无尾猿是不适宜夜间不睡觉的。无尾猿可不像老鼠或蝙蝠那样夜间活动——唉，我可怜的脑袋好疼啊。”在无尾猿的另一边，猫儿金格正在走来，它走得脚步很轻很庄重，尾巴笔直地翘在空中。它们向篝火走去，它们离蒂莲很近，如果方向对头，它们立刻就会看见蒂莲的。幸亏它们看的方向不对头。但蒂莲听见利什达低声对金格说道。“猫儿，站到你的岗位上去。注意好生扮演你的角色。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For really, as it happened, the whole thing was rather like a theatre. The crowd of Narnians were like the people in the seats; the little grassy place just in front of the stable, where the bonfire burned and the Ape and the Captain stood to talk to the crowd, was like the stage; the stable itself was like the scenery at the back of the stage; and Tirian and his friends were like people peering round from behind the scenery. It was a splendid position. If any of them stepped forward into the full firelight, all eyes would be fixed on him at once: on the other hand, so long as they stood still in the shadow of the end-wall of the stable, it was a hundred to one against their being noticed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为事情的发展，整个局面确实就像在一个戏院里一般。纳尼亚的群兽，就像坐在座位上的观众，马厩前一小块草地就像舞台，篝火熊熊燃烧着，无尾猿和卡乐门队长站在那儿向群众讲话，马厩既本身就像舞台后面的布景，而蒂莲和他的朋友们，就像在布景背后隐约出现的人们。如果他们之中有哪一个往外走到火光里来，所有的眼睛立刻都会盯住他们直瞧，另一方面呢，只要他们一动也不动地站在马厩远处墙头的阴影里，百分之九十九是不会被人注意到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Miaow, miaow. Count on me!" said Ginger. Then he stepped away beyond the bonfire and sat down in the front row of the assembled Beasts: in the audience, as you might say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“妙，妙。瞧我的！”金格说道。然后它走到篝火外面，在集合拢来的野兽们的第一排里坐下，正如你要说的，坐在观众中间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rishda Tarkaan dragged the Ape up close to the fire. The pair of them turned to face the crowd, and this of course meant that their backs were towards Tirian and his friends.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, Monkey," said Rishda Tarkaan in a low voice. "Say the words that wiser heads have put into thy mouth. And hold up thy head." As he spoke he gave the Ape a little prod or kick from behind with the point of his toe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，猴子，”利什达泰坎低声说道，“把比你聪明的头脑灌输到你嘴巴里的话讲出来吧。把你的头昂起来。”他一边说话一边用他的脚趾尖在背后给无尾猿一戳或是一踢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do leave me alone," muttered Shift. But he sat up straighter and began, in a louder voice -- "Now listen, all of you. A terrible thing has happened. A wicked thing. The wickedest thing that ever was done in Narnia. And Aslan --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你放开我。”诡谲喃喃说道。但它把身体坐得更直，用更加响亮的声音，开言道， “你们大家都注意听着。一件可怕的事情发生了。一件邪恶的事情。在纳尼亚发生的最最邪恶的事情。阿斯兰——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said the Ape. "At this very moment, when the Terrible One himself is among us -- there in the stable just behind me -- one wicked Beast has chosen to do what you'd think no one would dare to do even if He were a thousand miles away. It has dressed itself up in a lion-skin and is wandering about in these very woods pretending to be Aslan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”无尾猿说道，“就在此时此刻，可怕的神就在我们中间——而在我背后马厩里——一头邪恶的野兽竟蓄意干了一件十恶不赦的事情，你们都会认为，即使神在干里之外，也没有一个敢干这样的事的。它在身上披上了一张狮子皮毛，正在这些树林里跑来跑去，冒充是狮王阿斯兰。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill wondered for a moment if the Ape had gone mad. Was he going to tell the whole truth? A roar of horror and rage went up from the Beasts. "Grrr!" came the growls. "Who is he? Where is he? Just let me get my teeth into him!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔有一会儿感到诧异——这无尾猿是否疯了？它是否要把全部真相讲出来？野兽群中发出一阵恐怖和愤怒的吼声。“该死！”发出吼声来了，“它是什么东西？它在哪儿？让我们用牙齿咬死它！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill looked at the King: his mouth was open and his face was full of horror. And then she understood the devilish cunning of the enemies' plan. By mixing a little truth with it they had made their lie far stronger. What was the good, now, of telling the Beasts that an ass had been dressed up as a lion to deceive them? The Ape would only say, "That's just what I've said." What was the good of showing them Puzzle in his lion-skin? They would only tear him in pieces. "That's taken the wind out of our sails," whispered Eustace. "The ground is taken from under our feet," said Tirian. "Cursed, cursed cleverness!" said Poggin. "I'll be sworn that this new lie is of Ginger's making."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔瞧瞧国王。国王的嘴巴张开着，脸上充满恐怖的神情。这时他明白敌人计划之邪恶诡谲了。加了一点儿真相，就使它们的谎言强大有力得多啦。现在，告诉野兽们说一头驴子被打扮成一头狮子，来欺骗它们——那还有什么用处呢？无尾猿只要说一句“那就是我刚才说过的情况嘛。”就够了。把披着狮子毛皮的驴子示众，还有什么好处呢？野兽只会把驴子撕个稀烂。“那是收掉了我们的篷帆上的风。”尤斯塔斯低声说道。“把我们立足的土地抽掉了。”蒂莲说道。“该死的，该死的小聪明！”波金说道，“我敢打赌，这新的谎言准是金格创造出来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
