<div class="line_en">"You must understand, friends, that I know nothing of who I was and whence I came into this Dark World. I remember no time when I was not dwelling, as now, at the court of this all but heavenly Queen; but my thought is that she saved me from some evil enchantment and brought me hither of her exceeding bounty. (Honest Frogfoot, your cup is empty. Suffer me to refill it.) And this seems to me the likelier because even now I am bound by a spell, from which my Lady alone can free me. Every night there comes an hour when my mind is most horribly changed, and, after my mind, my body. For first I become furious and wild and would rush upon my dearest friends to kill them, if I were not bound. And soon after that, I turn into the likeness of a great serpent, hungry, fierce, and deadly. (Sir, be pleased to take another breast of pigeon, I entreat you.) So they tell me, and they certainly speak truth, for my Lady says the same. I myself know nothing of it, for when my hour is past I awake forgetful of all that vile fit and in my proper shape and sound mind -- saving that I am somewhat wearied. (Little lady, eat one of these honey cakes, which are brought for me from some barbarous land in the far south of the world.) Now the Queen's majesty knows by her art that I shall be freed from this enchantment when once she has made me king of a land in the Overworld and set its crown upon my head. The land is already chosen and the very place of our breaking out. Her Earthmen have worked day and night digging a way beneath it, and have now gone so far and so high that they tunnel not a score of feet beneath the very grass on which the Updwellers of that country walk. It will be very soon now that those Uplanders' fate will come upon them. She herself is at the diggings tonight, and I expect a message to go to her. Then the thin roof of earth which still keeps me from my kingdom will be broken through, and with her to guide me and a thousand Earthmen at my back, I shall ride forth in arms, fall suddenly on our enemies, slay their chief men, cast down their strong places, and doubtless be their crowned king within four and twenty hours."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a bit rough luck on them, isn't it?" said Scrubb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那他们就有点倒霉了吧？”斯克罗布说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thou art a lad of a wondrous, quick-working wit!" exclaimed the Knight. "For, on my honour, I had never thought of it so before. I see your meaning." He looked slightly, very slightly troubled for a moment or two; but his face soon cleared and he broke out, with another of his loud laughs, "But fie on gravity! Is it not the most comical and ridiculous thing in the world to think of them all going about their business and never dreaming that under their peaceful fields and floors, only a fathom down, there is a great army ready to break out upon them like a fountain! And they never to have suspected! Why, they themselves, when once the first smart of their defeat is over, can hardly choose but laugh at the thought!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这孩子头脑非常敏捷，”骑士失声喊道，“因为，凭良心说，我以前就从来没想到这点，我明白你的意思。”一时他看上去有一点点烦恼的样子；但他脸色很快就开朗了，又响亮地哈哈大笑起来。“呸，别一本正经了！想想看，他们全都在忙着自己的事，做梦也没想到在他们那宁静的田野和地板下面，只有六英尺以下，就有一支大军，准备着像喷泉一样冲出来打他们，这岂不是世界上最滑稽可笑的事吗？而且他们根本不会怀疑！嗨，他们吃过第一个大败仗的苦头之后就只好对这个妙计付之一笑了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" said the Knight, still laughing and patting her head in a quite infuriating fashion. "Is our little maid a deep politician? But never fear, sweetheart. In ruling that land, I shall do all by the counsel of my Lady, who will then be my Queen too. Her word shall be my law, even as my word will be law to the people we have conquered."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”骑士说着，一边还是笑个不停，一边激怒地拍拍她脑袋，“我们这位小姐竟是个深谋远虑的政治家？不过别害怕，宝贝儿。在统治那个国家时，我一切都要跟夫人商量，那时她也是我的王后了。她的话就是我的法律，甚至就像我的话将成为我们征服的人民的法律一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sounds a very nice lady indeed," said Puddleglum in a voice which meant exactly the opposite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听上去确实是一位非常好的夫人。”普德格伦说话的嗓音意味着他说的全是反话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shalt think otherwise when thou hast a man of thine own, I warrant you," said the Knight, apparently thinking this very funny. "But with my Lady, it is another matter. I am well content to live by her word, who has already saved me from a thousand dangers. No mother has taken pains more tenderly for her child, than the Queen's grace has for me. Why, look you, amid all her cares and business, she rideth out with me in the Overworld many a time and oft to accustom my eyes to the sunlight. And then I must go fully armed and with visor down, so that no man may see my face, and I must speak to no one. For she has found out by art magical that this would hinder my deliverance from the grievous enchantment I lie under. Is not that a lady worthy of a man's whole worship?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等你有了你自己的男人，包管你就不会那样想了。”骑士说，显然认为这话十分有趣，“不过跟夫人在一起，那是另一回事。我甘心情愿根据她的命令生活，她已经把我从无数次危险中拯救出来。没有一个母亲像女王陛下对我那样亲切地为孩子尽力。咳，听着，尽管她操劳的事这么多，还是常常陪我骑马到上面世界去，让我眼睛习惯阳光。那时我必须披甲挂胄，拉下面罩，这样就没人能看见我的脸，而且我千万不能跟任何人说话。因为她凭法术看出这样会妨碍我从可恶的魔法下解脱出来。难道那么一位夫人不值得男人全心全意崇拜吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where I come from," said Jill, who was disliking him more every minute, "they don't think much of men who are bossed about by their wives."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来的那个地方，”吉尔说，她越来越不喜欢他了，“他们可看不起被自己老婆指挥的男人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were thoroughly tired of the Knight's talk before they had finished supper. Puddleglum was thinking, "I wonder what game that witch is really playing with this young fool." Scrubb was thinking, "He's a great baby, really: tied to that woman's apron strings; he's a sap." And Jill was thinking, "He's the silliest, most conceited, selfish pig I've met for a long time." But when the meal was over, the Knight's mood had changed. There was no more laughter about him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们还没吃完晚饭就对骑士的话厌烦透了。普德格伦心想，“我真想知道那个女巫究竟在这个小傻瓜身上搞了什么鬼把戏。”斯克罗布心想，“他真是一个大活宝：被那个女人牵着鼻子走：他是个笨蛋。”吉尔心想，“我好久没见过他这么愚蠢，这么自负，这么自私的粗坯了。”但等吃过饭以后，骑士的态度就改变了，再也听不见他笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I say," said Scrubb, "I'm awfully sorry about your enchantment of course, but what will those fellows do to us when they come to bind you? They talked of putting us in prison. And we don't like all those dark places very much. We'd much rather stay here till you're… better… if we may."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”斯克罗布说，“我对你中了魔法当然感到非常遗憾，但那些家伙来绑你的时候又会怎样对待我们呢？他们说过要把我们关到牢里。我们可不大喜欢那种黑暗的地方。如果可以的话，我们宁可待在这儿，直到你……好转。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is well thought of," said the Knight. "By custom none but the Queen herself remains with me in my evil hour. Such is her tender care for my honour that she would not willingly suffer any ears but her own to hear the words I utter in that frenzy. But I could not easily persuade my attendant gnomes that you should be left with me. And I think I hear their soft feet even now upon the stairs. Go through yonder door: it leads into my other apartments. And there, either await my coming when they have unbound me; or, if you will, return and sit with me in my ravings."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“考虑得很周到，”骑士说，“习惯上，在我不幸发作的时刻里只有女王留在我身边。她对我的名誉如此关心体贴，除了她本人，她不愿让任何人听见我在昏乱中说的那些话。但我不容易说服那些小精灵随从让你们留在这儿陪我。而且我想我现在已经听见楼梯上有他们轻柔的脚步声了。你们从那边的门出去，门通向我另外的房间。你们或者在那儿等到他们给我松绑以后我过来；或者，你们愿意的话，在我说胡话的时候回到这儿来坐下陪着我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Friends," he said, "my hour is now very near. I am ashamed that you should see me yet I dread being left alone. They will come in presently and bind me hand and foot to yonder chair. Alas, so it must be: for in my fury, they tell me, I would destroy all that I could reach."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朋友们，”他说，“我的时辰已经很近了，让你们看见我那副模样，我真羞愧，然而我又怕一个人待着。他们很快就要来把我手脚绑在那边的椅子上。唉，一定得那样干：因为他们告诉我，我发起火来会把够得到的一切都毁掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They followed his directions and passed out of the room by a door which they had not yet seen opened. It brought them, they were pleased to see, not into darkness but into a lighted corridor. They tried various doors and found (what they very badly needed) water for washing and even a looking glass. "He never offered us a wash before supper," said Jill, drying her face. "Selfish, selfcentred pig."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们按照他的指点，从一扇没看见开过的门里走出房间。他们看到这扇门不是通向黑暗，而是通向一条有灯的走廊，心里很高兴。他们试着打开各扇门，找到了他们迫切需要用来洗洗脸的水，甚至还有一面镜子。“晚饭前他根本没请我们来洗一洗，”吉尔说着把脸擦干，“真是自私自利的粗坯。”">查看中文翻译</div>

There was sweat on his forehead and his face was filled with anguish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那扇大门这会儿已经关上了，遮住了他们最初进来时走过的门帘。骑士坐在一张古怪的银椅上，脚踝、膝部、肘部、手腕和腰部都绑在椅子上。他前额上全是汗，脸上神情非常痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come in, friends," he said, glancing quickly up. "The fit is not yet upon me. Make no noise, for I told that prying chamberlain that you were in bed. Now… I can feel it coming. Quick! Listen while I am master of myself. When the fit is upon me, it well may be that I shall beg and implore you, with entreaties and threatenings, to loosen my bonds. They say I do. I shall call upon you by all that is most dear and most dreadful. But do not listen to me. Harden your hearts and stop your ears. For while I am bound you are safe. But if once I were up and out of this chair, then first would come my fury, and after that" -- he shuddered -- "the change into a loathsome serpent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“进来，朋友们，”他说，一边赶快看了他们一眼，“我还没开始发作。你们别出声，因为我告诉那爱打听的侍从你们已经睡觉去了。现在……我能感觉到就要发作了。快，趁我还作得了自己的主，听我说。当我发作时，我很可能会哀求你们，恳求你们给我松绑，又是软磨又是恐吓。他们说我会这样做。我会用一切最可爱和最可怕的话请求你们。但你们别听我的话。硬起心肠，堵起耳朵。因为我被绑着的时候你们就安全。但要是我一旦站起来，离开了这张椅子，那么我首先就要狂怒，过后”——他浑身发抖——“就变成一条可恶的毒蛇。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a dreadful question. What had been the use of promising one another that they would not on any account set the Knight free, if they were now to do so the first time he happened to call upon a name they really cared about? On the other hand, what had been the use of learning the signs if they weren't going to obey them? Yet could Aslan have really meant them to unbind anyone even a lunatic -- who asked it in his name? Could it be a mere accident? Or how if the Queen of the Underworld knew all about the signs and had made the Knight learn this name simply in order to entrap them? But then, supposing this was the real sign?… They had muffed three already; they daren't muff the fourth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这问题倒难办了。要是他第一次偶然提起一个他们真正关心的名字，他们就把骑士放开，那么刚才彼此保证在任何情况下都不放开他又有什么用？反过来说，要是他们不打算遵照指示行事，那学指示还有什么用？不过，阿斯兰是否可能真的要他们给以他的名义提出松绑要求的任何人松绑呢——哪怕那人是个疯子？这会不会仅仅出于偶然呢？如果地下世界的女王知道有关指示的一切，就迫使骑士学说这个名字，就为了让他们落入圈套，那又怎么办呢？但是，假定这是真正的指示呢？……他们已经错过了三点，可不敢错过第四点了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You first!" he cried and fell upon the silver chair. That must have been a good sword.
