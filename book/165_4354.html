<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin spent a long time gazing out of the portholes at space. She understood that each time a star leapt out of the blue cluster in front, swept past the ship, and joined the red cluster behind the ship, it meant that Halo had passed it. She counted the stars and watched as they turned from blue to red -- the sight was hypnotic. Eventually, she fell asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">AA's words slid across Cheng Xin's thoughts like drops of water across a lily pad, leaving no trace. Cheng Xin's only thought was to find Yun Tianming and tell him everything. In her mind, a journey of 287 light-years would take a long time, but the ship's AI informed her that the trip would only take fifty-two hours in the ship's frame of reference. Everything felt unreal to Cheng Xin, as though she had already died and gone to another world.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Cheng Xin awakened, Halo was close to its destination. It turned 180 degrees and activated the curvature engine for deceleration -- in fact, the ship was pushing against its own trail. As the ship decelerated, the blue and red clusters began to spread out like two clusters of exploding fireworks, and soon evolved into a sea of stars distributed evenly around the ship. The slowing down of the ship also gradually erased the red and blue shifts. Cheng Xin and AA saw that the Milky Way ahead of them still looked about the same, but behind them, none of the stars looked familiar. The Solar System was long gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当程心醒来时，“星环”号已经接近目的恒星，它的船身旋转了一百八十度，曲率引擎对着前进方向开始减速。这时，飞船其实是在推着航迹前进。减速开始后，前方的蓝色星团和后方的红色星团都在渐渐散开，像两团绽放的焰火一般，很快扩散成满天的星海。随着速度的降低，多普勒效应产生的蓝色和红色也渐渐消退。程心和AA看到，前方的银河系的形状没有发生肉眼能够觉察到的变化，但向后看，只见到一片陌生的星群，太阳系早已无影无踪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Halo engaged the fusion reactor, and the silence on the ship was broken. The humming of the engine filled the ship, and every surface vibrated slightly. The ship's AI analyzed the data obtained by the monitoring system and confirmed the basic facts about this solar system: DX3906 had two planets, both of them solid. The one farther from the star was about the size of Mars, but it had no atmosphere and appeared gray in color -- so Cheng Xin and AA decided to call it Planet Gray. The other planet, closer to the star, was about the size of the Earth, and its surface resembled the Earth's: an atmosphere containing oxygen and many signs of life, but without evidence of agriculture or industry. Since it was blue, like the Earth, they decided to call it Planet Blue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“星环”号关闭曲率引擎后，启动了聚变发动机，飞船上的宁静被打破了，出现了推进器的嗡嗡声和微微的震动。飞船AI对监测系统刚刚得到的数据进行分析，重新确定了这个星系的基本状况：DX3906恒星有两颗行星，都是固态行星，其中距恒星较远的一颗体积与火星相当，但没有大气层，表面十分荒凉，由于它呈灰色，程心和AA把它叫做灰星。轨道半径较小的另一颗行星体积与地球相当，表面特征也与地球十分相似，有含氧大气层，且有明显的生命迹象，但没有发现农业和工业文明存在的痕迹；它像地球一样呈现出蓝色，她们叫它蓝星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">AA was very happy that her research had been confirmed. More than four hundred years ago, she had discovered the star's planetary system. Before then, people had thought it was a bare star without any planets. Through that work, AA had gotten to know Cheng Xin. Without that coincidence, her life would have turned out completely differently. Fate was such an odd thing: Four centuries ago, when she had gazed at this distant world through the telescope, she could never have imagined that she'd come here one day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Halo had taken only fifty-two hours (by the ship's frame of reference) to traverse the 286 light-years between the Solar System and the planetary system around DX3906, but it took eight full days to cross the sixty AU between the rim of the planetary system and Planet Blue at sub-light speeds. As Halo approached Planet Blue, Cheng Xin and AA discovered that its resemblance to the Earth was only superficial. The blue hue of this planet wasn't the result of an ocean, but the color of the vegetation covering the continents. Planet Blue's oceans were light yellow and took up only about a fifth of the planet's surface. Planet Blue was a cold world; about a third of its continental surface was covered by blue vegetation, with the rest shrouded in snow. Most of the ocean was frozen, and only small patches near the equator were in liquid form.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“星环”号飞越太阳系到DX3906间的二百八十六光年只用了五十二个小时，但以亚光速从这个星系的边缘行驶到那颗类地行星，这仅仅六十个天文单位的路程却用了整整八天时间。在飞船接近蓝星时，程心和AA发现它与地球外观上的相似是虚假的。这颗行星的蓝色并不是海洋的颜色，而是陆地上植被的色彩。蓝星上的海洋呈淡黄色，面积只占星球表面积的五分之一。蓝星是一个寒冷的世界，它的陆地除了约三分之一的蓝色区域，大部分被白雪覆盖，海洋也大部分封冻，只有靠近赤道的小片区域处于融化状态。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty minutes later, Halo landed near the equator.

Out of the porthole and on the monitoring system terminals, they could see that the yacht had landed in the middle of a blue grassland. Not too far away, they could see rolling mountains covered by snow -- the landing site was near the foot of the mountain range. The sky was a light yellow, like the ocean when viewed from space.

As soon as AA heard that, she tossed away the stalks of grass she was playing with in her hands. Yifan explained that the blades of grass really were plants, and relied on photosynthesis, possessing only a basic sense of touch. The other plants in this world were also capable of moving.

<div class="line_en">Like Halo, Hunter was equipped with both a curvature engine and a fusion engine. When traveling between planets within the same system, only the fusion engine was used, because the curvature engine would have caused the ship to overshoot the target with no time for deceleration. Hunter left orbit and headed for Planet Gray, which appeared as a small spot of light. Out of consideration for Cheng Xin, Guan Yifan initially limited the acceleration to 1.5G, but Cheng Xin told him not to worry about her and just make the trip faster. He increased the acceleration, the blue flame emitted by the nozzles doubled in length, and the hypergravity increased to 3G. At this point, all they could do was to sit in the embrace of the acceleration seats. They were not able to move much, so Yifan switched the ship to surround-holographic display mode, and the ship's hull disappeared. Suspended in space, they watched Planet Blue recede. Cheng Xin imagined the 3G gravity as coming from Planet Blue so that space separated into up and down, and they were flying up toward the galaxy.</div>

He told her that he had no duties during the long voyage searching for habitable worlds. After the two ships discovered the habitable World I, much of life consisted of opening up the world for settlement and constructing the basics. The first settlement resembled a small town from agrarian times, and the rough conditions did not permit any kind of scientific research. The new world's government passed a resolution to let all scientists enter or remain in hibernation, to be awakened only when conditions permitted basic research.

I'm not talking about building light tombs -- or, as you call them, black domains. Those are just defensive mechanisms employed by weak worms like us. The gods do not stoop so low. In war, it's possible to make reduced-lightspeed black holes to seal the enemy inside. But more commonly, the technique is used to construct the equivalents of pits and city walls. Some reduced-lightspeed belts are large enough to traverse an entire arm of a galaxy. In places where the stars are dense, many reduced-lightspeed black holes can be connected together into chains that stretch for tens of millions of light-years. That's a Great Wall at the scale of the universe. Even the most powerful fleets, once trapped, would not be able to escape. Those barriers are very difficult to cross."</div>

She imagined that he was trying to rescue her from drowning. In the cold light, she saw his eyes, which seemed to be telling her that they were almost at the surface. Cheng Xin could feel the air pressure in the cabin rising, and just when she was about to pass out from lack of air, Yifan snapped her visor open, as well as his own. The two gulped air.</div>
