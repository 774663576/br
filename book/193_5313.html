<div class="line_en">"You are well aware," the camerlegno said, "that our four preferiti are not present in conclave at this moment. I ask, in the name of his late Holiness, that you proceed as you must… with faith and purpose. May you have only God before your eyes." Then he turned to go.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a long pause.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库沉默许久。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But," one cardinal blurted out, "where are they?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Half an hour ago, at the appointed hour, Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca had entered the chapel. He walked to the front altar and gave opening prayer. Then, he unfolded his hands and spoke to them in a tone as direct as anything Mortati had ever heard from the altar of the Sistine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半个小时前，就在约定的时间，卡罗．凡特雷思卡总司库进入了礼拜堂。他走到前方的祭坛，做了开场祷告。然后，他张开双手，用一种极其坦白的口吻说话，那是莫塔提毕生听过在西斯汀祭坛上最直率的语气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That I cannot honestly say."</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the soft glow of candlelight in the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati was on edge. Conclave had officially begun. And it had begun in a most inauspicious fashion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Proceed as we must, Mortati decided, taking his lead from the resolve in the camerlegno's voice. So he had called for a vote. What else could he do?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="务必继续进行会议，莫塔提决定了，他已经从总司库的声音中悟得了解答。于是他宣佈进行投票，不然还能怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The doors to the Sistine Chapel had been sealed, as was the custom, with two heavy chains on the outside. Four Swiss Guards stood watch in the hallway beyond. Mortati knew the only way the doors could be opened now, prior to electing a Pope, was if someone inside fell deathly ill, or if thepreferiti arrived. Mortati prayed it would be the latter, although from the knot in his stomach he was not so sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西斯汀礼拜堂的门关起来了，一如惯例，用两条沉重的铁鍊从外头封起。四名瑞士卫兵站在门前的走道上看守。莫塔提知道现在那些门在选出新教宗之前不会再打开，除非礼拜堂裡面有人病危，或者是候选人来到。莫塔提祈祷会是后面的那个情况发生，虽然他沉重的胃表明了他对这点没有把握。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, at last, the final cardinal had arrived at the altar and was kneeling before him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，终于，最后一个枢机主教来到祭坛，跪在他面前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had taken thirty minutes to complete the preparatory rituals leading up to this first vote. Mortati had waited patiently at the main altar as each cardinal, in order of seniority, had approached and performed the specific balloting procedure.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cardinal stood up. He held his ballot high over his head for everyone to see. Then he lowered the ballot to the altar, where a plate sat atop a large chalice. He placed the ballot on the plate. Next he picked up the plate and used it to drop the ballot into the chalice. Use of the plate was to ensure no one secretly dropped multiple ballots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位枢机主教站起身，把自己的选票高举过头让每个人都能看见。然后他把选票放低，祭坛上有个大圣爵，上方放了个盘子。他把选票放在盘子裡，接著拿起盘子，将选票倒入圣爵内。使用盘子是为了确保没有人会暗自投入不止一张的选票。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leaving the plate on top of the chalice, Mortati shook the ballots to mix them. Then he removed the plate and extracted a ballot at random. He unfolded it. The ballot was exactly two inches wide. He read aloud for everyone to hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提让盘子仍留在圣爵上，然后摇摇选票使之混合。然后他拿开盘子，任意抽出一张选票。他打开那张刚好两吋宽的选票，大声念出，好让每个人都能听到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After he had submitted his ballot, he replaced the plate over the chalice, bowed to the cross, and returned to his seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他投下选票后，把盘子放回圣爵上，对著十字架欠了个身，回到座位上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it was time for Mortati to go to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在轮到莫塔提尽他的责任了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Eligo in summum pontificem…" he declared, reading the text that was embossed at the top of every ballot. I elect as Supreme Pontiff… Then he announced the nominee's name that had been written beneath it. After he read the name, he raised a threaded needle and pierced the ballot through the word Eligo, carefully sliding the ballot onto the thread. Then he made note of the vote in a logbook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我选择最高司祭为……」他以拉丁文大声唸出每张选票上方印的字，然后宣佈写在下头的那个名字。念完名字后，他举起一根穿了线的针，从选择（Eligo。）一字之处刺穿选票，然后小心把选票拉到线上，又在一本纪录簿上登录。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next, he repeated the entire procedure. He chose a ballot from the chalice, read it aloud, threaded it onto the line, and made note in his log. Almost immediately, Mortati sensed this first vote would be failed. No consensus. After only seven ballots, already seven different cardinals had been named. As was normal, the handwriting on each ballot was disguised by block printing or flamboyant script. The concealment was ironic in this case because the cardinals were obviously submitting votes for themselves. This apparent conceit, Mortati knew, had nothing to do with self-centered ambition. It was a holding pattern. A defensive maneuver. A stall tactic to ensure no cardinal received enough votes to win… and another vote would be forced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提几乎立刻就发现第一次选举不会有结果。选票太分歧了。才七张选票，就已经出现了七个枢机主教的名字。一如往常，写在每张选票上的笔迹都以印刷体或夸张的草体掩饰。这个隐藏的手段在眼前变得很讽刺，因为每个枢机主教显然都是投票给自己。莫塔提知道，他们投票给自己，完全无关乎自我中心的野心。而是一种保留模式，一种防卫手段。这个拖延战术可以确保任何枢机主教都不会得到足够的当选票数……于是就得进行下一次投票。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cardinals were waiting for theirpreferiti…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在场的枢机主教都在等候他们的中意人选……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the last of the ballots had been tallied, Mortati declared the vote "failed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一张选票记录完之后，莫塔提宣佈这次投票「失败」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took the thread carrying all the ballots and tied the ends together to create a ring. Then he lay the ring of ballots on a silver tray. He added the proper chemicals and carried the tray to a small chimney behind him. Here he lit the ballots. As the ballots burned, the chemicals he'd added created black smoke. The smoke flowed up a pipe to a hole in the roof where it rose above the chapel for all to see. Cardinal Mortati had just sent his first communication to the outside world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿起串著所有选票的线，两端打结成为一个环。然后他将选票环放在一个银托盘上，加入适当的化学物质，再把托盘拿到他身后的一个小烟窗下，在此用火点燃选票。选票燃烧时，裡面所加的化学物质会製造出黑烟。上涌的烟经过一个管子，通往礼拜堂屋顶上方的一个烟窗口，好让大家都看得见。莫塔提枢机主教刚刚向外界送出了第一个讯息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One balloting. No Pope.</div>
