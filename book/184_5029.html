<div class="line_en">Two Earthmen entered, but instead of advancing into the room, they placed themselves one on each side of the door, and bowed deeply. They were followed immediately by the last person whom anyone had expected or wished to see: the Lady of the Green Kirtle, the Queen of Underland. She stood dead still in the doorway, and they could see her eyes moving as she took in the whole situation -- the three strangers, the silver chair destroyed, and the Prince free, with his sword in his hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned very white; but Jill thought it was the sort of whiteness that comes over some people's faces not when they are frightened but when they are angry. For a moment the Witch fixed her eyes on the Prince, and there was murder in them. Then she seemed to change her mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她脸色发白，但吉尔认为这种白不是有些人受惊时那种白，而是愤怒时的那种白。女巫盯着王子看了一会儿，眼神杀气腾腾，随后她似乎改了主意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Prince Rilian shivered as she spoke to him. And no wonder: it is not easy to throw off in half an hour an enchantment which has made one a slave for ten years. Then, speaking with a great effort, he said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她跟瑞廉王子说话的时候，他打了个哆嗦。这也难怪，要在半小时之内摆脱一种使人当了十年奴隶的魔法可不容易。因此，他费了好大的劲才说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Madam, there will be no more need of that chair. And you, who have told me a hundred times how deeply you pitied me for the sorceries by which I was bound, will doubtless hear with joy that they are now ended for ever. There was, it seems, some small error in your Ladyship's way of treating them. These, my true friends, have delivered me. I am now in my right mind, and there are two things I will say to you. First -- as for your Ladyship's design of putting me at the head of an army of Earthmen so that I may break out into the Overworld and there, by main force, make myself king over some nation that never did me wrong -- murdering their natural lords and holding their throne as a bloody and foreign tyrant -- now that I know myself, I do utterly abhor and renounce it as plain villainy. And second: I am the King's son of Narnia, Rilian, the only child of Caspian, Tenth of that name, whom some call Caspian the Seafarer. Therefore, Madam, it is my purpose, as it is also my duty, to depart suddenly from your Highness's court into my own country. Please it you to grant me and my friends safe conduct and a guide through your dark realm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，那把椅子已经用不着了。你曾经干百次告诉过我，你是多么深切地怜悯我受到魔法禁锢，你听到这魔法如今已经永远完蛋，无疑也会高兴的。看来，夫人对待这消息的方式似乎有点不大对头。是我这些真诚的朋友解救了我。我现在头脑清醒了，有两件事我要告诉你。首先——说到夫人设计的让我率领一支地下人的军队，以便破土而出到上面世界去，全靠武力让我在一个从来没有对不起我的国家里当国王——杀害他们原来的贵族，像个残忍的外国暴君那样霸占他们的王位——如今我清醒了，我绝对憎恶和放弃这种十足的罪恶勾当。其次，我是纳尼亚国王的儿子，瑞廉，人称航海家凯斯宾，凯斯宾十世的独子。夫人，因此，突然离开陛下的宫廷回到我自己的国家是我的目的，也是我的责任。请你授予我和我的朋友安全通行证，并派一个向导领我们通过你的黑暗王国。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Narnia?" she said. "Narnia? I have often heard your Lordship utter that name in your ravings. Dear Prince, you are very sick. There is no land called Narnia."</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the Witch said nothing at all, but moved gently across the room, always keeping her face and eyes very steadily towards the Prince. When she had come to a little ark set in the wall not far from the fireplace, she opened it, and took out first a handful of a green powder. This she threw on the fire. It did not blaze much, but a very sweet and drowsy smell came from it. And all through the conversation which followed, that smell grew stronger, and filled the room, and made it harder to think. Secondly, she took out a musical instrument rather like a mandolin. She began to play it with her fingers -- a steady, monotonous thrumming that you didn't notice after a few minutes. But the less you noticed it, the more it got into your brain and your blood. This also made it hard to think. After she had thrummed for a time (and the sweet smell was now strong) she began speaking in a sweet, quiet voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿女巫一言不发，只是轻轻穿过房间，脸和眼睛始终牢牢对着王子。她来到火炉边不远，墙上一套小柜子旁边，打开柜子，拿出一把绿色的粉末，把粉末撒在火上。那粉末不大发光，只发出一股让人昏昏欲睡的香味。接下来大家谈话时，那股气味一直越来越浓，弥漫在整个房间里，使人动不了脑筋。其次，她拿出一件类似曼陀林的乐器。开始用手指弹着乐器——一种没有变化、单调的噔噔声，开头一会儿你并不在意，但你越不去注意这声音，这声音却越钻到你脑子里和血液里。这也使你动不了脑筋。她这么弹了一阵子（那股香味儿也更浓了），就开始用一副甜蜜、沉着的嗓音说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请原谅，小兄弟，”女巫笑了（你从来没听到过比这更可爱的笑声），“我可记不得这次见面。但我们做梦时常常在希奇古怪的地方遇见我们的朋友。除非所有的梦全都一样，你不能要求人家记住梦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We've been there, too," snapped Jill. She was very angry because she could feel enchantment getting hold of her every moment. But of course the very fact that she could still feel it, showed that it had not yet fully worked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们也到过那儿。”吉尔厉声说。她能感觉到魔法正逐渐在控制她，所以很生气。但从她还能感觉到这事实来看，当然说明魔法还没有完全起作用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course a lot of things darted into Jill's head at once: Experiment House, Adela Pennyfather, her own home, radio-sets, cinemas, cars, aeroplanes, ration-books, queues. But they seemed dim and far away. (Thrum thrum -- thrum -- went the strings of the Witch's instrument.) Jill couldn't remember the names of the things in our world. And this time it didn't come into her head that she was being enchanted, for now the magic was in its full strength; and of course, the more enchanted you get, the more certain you feel that you are not enchanted at all.

"But you can play that fiddle till your fingers drop off, and still you won't make me forget Narnia; and the whole Overworld too. We'll never see it again, I shouldn't wonder. You may have blotted it out and turned it dark like this, for all I know. Nothing more likely. But I know I was there once. I've seen the sky full of stars. I've seen the sun coming up out of the sea of a morning and sinking behind the mountains at night. And I've seen him up in the midday sky when I couldn't look at him for brightness."</div>

You have seen lamps, and so you imagined a bigger and better lamp and called it the sun. You've seen cats, and now you want a bigger and better cat, and it's to be called a lion. Well, 'tis a pretty makebelieve, though, to say truth, it would suit you all better if you were younger. And look how you can put nothing into your make-believe without copying it from the real world, this world of mine, which is the only world. But even you children are too old for such play. As for you, my lord Prince, that art a man full grown, fie upon you! Are you not ashamed of such toys? Come, all of you. Put away these childish tricks. I have work for you all in the real world. There is no Narnia, no Overworld, no sky, no sun, no Aslan. And now, to bed all. And let us begin a wiser life tomorrow.

<div class="line_cn" title="女巫摇摇头。“我明白了，”她说，“我们看你们称之为狮子跟你们的太阳都是一回事。你们看见过灯，于是你们想像出一个更大更好的灯，把它叫做太阳。你们见过猫，现在你们想要一只更大更好的猫，你们就叫它做狮子。好了，这都是有趣的想像。不过，老实说，要是你们年纪小一点，这样说说会更合适些。瞧你们不从我这个真正的世界里偷学些什么，你们又怎么能想像得出呢，我这个世界才是惟一的世界。但即使是你们两个孩子玩这套游戏也太大了。至于你，王子殿下，你是个成年人了，真亏你做得出！你玩这种玩意儿就不害臊吗？来吧，你们大伙儿。把这套孩子气的把戏收起来。在真正的世界里，我有活儿给你们大家干。没有什么纳尼亚，没有上面的世界，没有天空，没有太阳，没有阿斯兰。现在大家都上床去吧。让我们明天开始过得更懂事吧。但首先是上床、睡觉，睡得熟熟的，软软的枕头，好好睡一觉，不做荒唐的梦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Prince and the two children were standing with their heads hung down, their cheeks flushed, their eyes half closed; the strength all gone from them; the enchantment almost complete. But Puddleglum, desperately gathering all his strength, walked over to the fire. Then he did a very brave thing. He knew it wouldn't hurt him quite as much as it would hurt a human; for his feet (which were bare) were webbed and hard and coldblooded like a duck's. But he knew it would hurt him badly enough; and so it did. With his bare foot he stamped on the fire, grinding a large part of it into ashes on the flat hearth. And three things happened at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子和两个孩子站在那儿，搭拉着脑袋，脸蛋红红的，眼睛半开半闭；他们浑身无力，魔法几乎就大功告成了。不料普德格伦拼命鼓起全身力量，走到火炉边。接着它干了一件非常勇敢的事。它知道火会烧伤它，但不会像烧伤人那么严重。因为它光着的脚像鸭子一样有蹼，又硬，而且又是冷血的。但它知道火也会把它烧得够呛；果然如此。它光着脚就去踩火，把浅浅的炉床里的大部分火都碾成了灰。这一来立刻就发生了三件事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First, the sweet heavy smell grew very much less. For though the whole fire had not been put out, a good bit of it had, and what remained smelled very largely of burnt Marsh-wiggle, which is not at all an enchanting smell. This instantly made everyone's brain far clearer. The Prince and the children held up their heads again and opened their eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一，那股又香又浓的味道大为减少。因为尽管火还没完全扑灭，也已经灭了一大半，而且留下了沼泽怪烧伤的浓烈焦臭味，那就完全不是魔法的气味了。这一下顿时使每个人的脑子都清醒多了。王子和两个孩子又抬起头，睁开了眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Secondly, the Witch, in a loud, terrible voice, utterly different from all the sweet tones she had been using up till now, called out, "What are you doing? Dare to touch my fire again, mud-filth, and I'll turn the blood to fire inside your veins."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二，女巫一反刚才一直用的甜言蜜语声调，扯起嗓门，怪吓人地大声叫道，“你干什么？再敢碰碰我的火，脏泥巴，我要把你血管里的血烧起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thirdly, the pain itself made Puddleglum's head for a moment perfectly clear and he knew exactly what he really thought. There is nothing like a good shock of pain for dissolving certain kinds of magic.</div>

<div class="line_en">"One word, Ma'am," he said, coming back from the fire; limping, because of the pain. "One word. All you've been saying is quite right, I shouldn't wonder. I'm a chap who always liked to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it. So I won't deny any of what you said. But there's one thing more to be said, even so. Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things -- trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a playworld which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia. So, thanking you kindly for our supper, if these two gentlemen and the young lady are ready, we're leaving your court at once and setting out in the dark to spend our lives looking for Overland. Not that our lives will be very long, I should think; but that's a small loss if the world's as dull a place as you say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再说一句，夫人，”它说着从火炉边走回来，因为脚痛，走路一瘸一拐，“再说一句。你刚才说的一切都很对，这我不奇怪。但我这家伙一向喜欢知道最坏的情况，然后尽量往好处想。因此我不否认你说的一切。但即使如此，也还得再说上一句。假定我们只是梦见，或者说捏造出了那一切——树木啊，草地啊，太阳啊，月亮啊，星星啊，还有阿斯兰本身。假定这都是我们梦见的。那么我能说的一切就是，既然那样，那捏造出来的东西似乎比真正的东西重要得多。假定你这个王国的黑洞就是惟一世界的话。咳，那我可觉得是一个挺可怜的世界。想起这点来倒也有趣。要是你说得对，我们只是些小娃娃，凑起来玩游戏。但四个小娃娃玩的游戏能成为一个游戏世界，把你那真正的世界打得落花流水。那就是我忠于游戏世界的原因。即使没有阿斯兰来领导这个世界，我也站在阿斯兰一边。即使没有纳尼亚这个地方，我也要尽量像一个纳尼亚人那样生活。所以，感谢你好意招待我们吃晚饭，要是这两位先生和小姐准备好了，我们立刻就离开你的王宫，在黑暗中出发，去为寻找上面的世界奉献一生。我想，这并不是说我们的一生会过得很长，但要是这个世界就像你说的这样沉闷，那么这也不是什么大损失。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The instrument dropped from her hands. Her arms appeared to be fastened to her sides. Her legs were intertwined with each other, and her feet had disappeared. The long green train of her skirt thickened and grew solid, and seemed to be all one piece with the writhing green pillar of her interlocked legs. And that writhing green pillar was curving and swaying as if it had no joints, or else were all joints. Her head was thrown far back and while her nose grew longer and longer, every other part of her face seemed to disappear, except her eyes. Huge flaming eyes they were now, without brows or lashes. All this takes time to write down; it happened so quickly that there was only just time to see it. Long before there was time to do anything, the change was complete, and the great serpent which the Witch had become, green as poison, thick as Jill's waist, had flung two or three coils of its loathsome body round the Prince's legs. Quick as lightning another great loop darted round, intending to pinion his sword-arm to his side. But the Prince was just in time. He raised his arms and got them clear: the living knot closed only round his chest -- ready to crack his ribs like firewood when it drew tight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个乐器已经从她手里掉了下来。她两条胳臂似乎紧紧贴在身体两侧。两条腿缠在一起，脚已经不见了。长长的绿裙裙摆变厚，变成了实心的，似乎跟两根连在一起的腿拧成一根蠕动的绿柱子。而那根蠕动的绿柱子正歪歪扭扭，摇摇摆摆，仿佛浑身没有关节，要不然就是浑身都是关节。她的脑袋远远朝后仰着，鼻子变得越来越长，脸上除了眼睛以外，其他部分似乎都不见了。这会儿只见两只火红的大眼晴，没有眉毛也没有睫毛。所有这一切写下来虽很费时间，但事情发生得那么快，差点看都来不及看。他们还没工夫动手干什么，女巫早就变成了一条大毒蛇，像毒药一样绿幽幽，有吉尔的腰那么粗，已经把它那令人恶心的身体在王子腿上绕了两三圈。另外一大圈也像闪电般冲上来，打算把王子拿剑的那条胳臂贴身捆住。但王子正好及时举起了双臂，没给缠上。那活结只缠到他胸脯——准备收紧后把王子的肋骨当木柴般弄断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Prince, when he had breath, said, "Gentlemen, I thank you." Then the three conquerors stood staring at one another and panting, without another word, for a long time.

<div class="line_en">The Prince caught the creature's neck in his left hand, trying to squeeze it till it choked. This held its face (if you could call it a face) about five inches from his own. The forked tongue flickered horribly in and out, but could not reach him. With his right hand he drew back his sword for the strongest blow he could give. Meanwhile Scrubb and Puddleglum had drawn their weapons and rushed to his aid. All three blows fell at once: Scrubb's (which did not even pierce the scales and did no good) on the body of the snake below the Prince's hand, but the Prince's own blow and Puddleglum's both on its neck.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even that did not quite kill it, though it began to loosen its hold on Rilian's legs and chest. With repeated blows they hacked off its head.
