<div class="line_en">When they arrived in San Francisco, my father made her hide those shiny clothes. She wore the same brown-checked Chinese dress until the Refugee Welcome Society gave her two hand-me-down dresses, all too large in sizes for American women. The society was composed of a group of white-haired American missionary ladies from the First Chinese Baptist Church. And because of their gifts, my parents could not refuse their invitation to join the church. Nor could they ignore the old ladies' practical advice to improve their English through Bible study class on Wednesday nights and, later, through choir practice on Saturday mornings. This was how my parents met the Hsus, the Jongs, and the St. Clairs. My mother could sense that the women of these families also had unspeakable tragedies they had left behind in China and hopes they couldn't begin to express in their fragile English. Or at least, my mother recognized the numbness in these women's faces. And she saw how quickly their eyes moved when she told them her idea for the Joy Luck Club.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother started the San Francisco version of the Joy Luck Club in 1949, two years before I was born. This was the year my mother and father left China with one stiff leather trunk filled only with fancy silk dresses. There was no time to pack anything else, my mother had explained to my father after they boarded the boat. Still his hands swam frantically between the slippery silks, looking for his cotton shirts and wool pants.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I dreamed about Kweilin before I ever saw it," my mother began, speaking Chinese. "I dreamed of jagged peaks lining a curving river, with magic moss greening the banks. At the tops of these peaks were white mists. And if you could float down this river and eat the moss for food, you would be strong enough to climb the peak. If you slipped, you would only fall into a bed of soft moss and laugh. And once you reached the top, you would be able to see everything and feel such happiness it would be enough to never have worries in your life ever again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我母亲总是用中国话开始她的叙述：“我在还未去桂林前，就梦见它好几回了。群山环绕中，一条小河蜿蜒而过，河上漂着青色的浮萍。天幕上衬着锯齿般的山峦，层层叠叠的，白云缭绕其间。如果你在河面上漂浮，仅以浮萍果腹，也能毫无难色地爬上山峰。如果你不慎滑跌下来，也只是坠入一张柔软的浮萍织成的大床上。一旦你爬至顶峰，你会因眼前袒露的一切而欣喜若狂，它会涤净你的一切烦恼不快，扫尽一切腌臢之气。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Joy Luck was an idea my mother remembered from the days of her first marriage in Kweilin, before the Japanese came. That's why I think of Joy Luck as her Kweilin story. It was the story she would always tell me when she was bored, when there was nothing to do, when every bowl had been washed and the Formica table had been wiped down twice, when my father sat reading the newspaper and smoking one Pall Mall cigarette after another, a warning not to disturb him. This is when my mother would take out a box of old ski sweaters sent to us by unseen relatives from Vancouver. She would snip the bottom of a sweater and pull out a kinky thread of yarn, anchoring it to a piece of cardboard. And as she began to roll with one sweeping rhythm, she would start her story. Over the years, she told me the same story, except for the ending, which grew darker, casting long shadows into her life, and eventually into mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喜福会这一名字，起缘于我母亲的第一次婚姻，那还是在日军占领桂林前。所以一提到喜福会，就会使我想到她的桂林故事。每当她把碗碟擦干净，塑料台面也已擦拭了两个来回，而父亲已开始将脸躲在报纸后面，一支接一支地抽他的黑猫牌香烟——这往往是一种“不要打搅”的警告，这便是她觉得无所事事之时，于是，她便会对我讲起她的往事。这个时候她总会拉出一箱旧毛衣，那是我们在温哥华的一个从未见过面的亲戚送给我们的。她从中捡出一件毛衣拆开底边，从中抽出根毛线头，随后，以一种破竹之势，毛线衣很快地化成一根弯弯曲曲的毛线，而她的故事，也以同样的节奏倾泻出来。数年来，她重复讲述着同一个故事，只是故事的结局，一次比一次黯淡，犹如她自己生活中的一道浓重的阴影。而今，这道阴影，也渗入到了我的生活中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In China, everybody dreamed about Kweilin. And when I arrived, I realized how shabby my dreams were, how poor my thoughts. When I saw the hills, I laughed and shuddered at the same time. The peaks looked like giant fried fish heads trying to jump out of a vat of oil. Behind each hill, I could see shadows of another fish, and then another and another. And then the clouds would move just a little and the hills would suddenly become monstrous elephants marching slowly toward me! Can you see this? And at the root of the hill were secret caves. Inside grew hanging rock gardens in the shapes and colors of cabbage, winter melons, turnips, and onions. These were things so strange and beautiful you can't ever imagine them."</div>

Every day, every hour, thousands of people poured into the city, crowding the sidewalks, looking for places to live. They came from the East, West, North, and South. They were rich and poor, Shanghainese, Cantonese, northerners, and not just Chinese, but foreigners and missionaries of every religion. And there was, of course, the Kuomintang and their army officers who thought they were top level to everyone else."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We were a city of leftovers mixed together. If it hadn't been for the Japanese, there would have been plenty of reason for fighting to break out among these different people. Can you see it? Shanghai people with north-water peasants, bankers with barbers, rickshaw pullers with Burma refugees. Everybody looked down on someone else. It didn't matter that everybody shared the same sidewalk to spit on and suffered the same fast-moving diarrhea. We all had the same stink, but everybody complained someone else smelled the worst. Me? Oh, I hated the American air force officers who said habba-habba sounds to make my face turn red. But the worst were the northern peasants who emptied their noses into their hands and pushed people around and gave everybody their dirty diseases."</div>

<div class="line_en">"So you can see how quickly Kweilin lost its beauty for me. I no longer climbed the peaks to say, How lovely are these hills! I only wondered which hills the Japanese had reached. I sat in the dark corners of my house with a baby under each arm, waiting with nervous feet. When the sirens cried out to warn us of bombers, my neighbors and I jumped to our feet and scurried to the deep caves to hide like wild animals. But you can't stay in the dark for so long. Something inside of you starts to fade and you become like a starving person, crazy-hungry for light. Outside I could hear the bombing. Boom! Boom! And then the sound of raining rocks. And inside I was no longer hungry for the cabbage or the turnips of the hanging rock garden. I could only see the dripping bowels of an ancient hill that might collapse on top of me. Can you imagine how it is, to want to be neither inside nor outside, to want to be nowhere and disappear?</div>

Every place was so crowded there was no room for fresh air. Unbearable smells from the sewers rose up to my second-story window and the stink had nowhere else to go but into my nose. At all hours of the night and day, I heard screaming sounds. I didn't know if it was a peasant slitting the throat of a runaway pig or an officer beating a half-dead peasant for lying in his way on the sidewalk. I didn't go to the window to find out.

How long can you see in your mind arms and legs hanging from telephone wires and starving dogs running down the streets with half-chewed hands dangling from their jaws? What was worse, we asked among ourselves, to sit and wait for our own deaths with proper somber faces? Or to choose our own happiness?"</div>

The same turquoise couch shaped in a semicircle of nubby tweed. The colonial end tables made out of heavy maple. A lamp of fake cracked porcelain. Only the scroll-length calendar, free from the Bank of Canton, changes every year.</div>

She and Auntie An-mei were dressed up in funny Chinese dresses with stiff stand-up collars and blooming branches of embroidered silk sewn over their breasts. These clothes were too fancy for real Chinese people, I thought, and too strange for American parties. In those days, before my mother told me her Kweilin story, I imagined Joy Luck was a shameful Chinese custom, like the secret gathering of the Ku Klux Klan or the tom-tom dances of TV Indians preparing for war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你得管住他们，”我母亲这样对我说，其含义就是，如果有谁摔破皮，或者烫伤啦，不见了，打碎什么了，把什么给弄脏了，不管是谁，反正都是我的过失。那时，她和安梅阿姨都穿着有趣的硬邦邦的立领中国式衣衫，前胸绣着花卉，这样的衣服对真正的中国人来说，是太时髦了，而在美国的聚会上穿，又显得太古怪。那时，在母亲还未与我讲述过桂林故事时，我想象中的喜福会，是一个有着特殊仪式的社团，好比三K党的集会及电视片中印第安人出征前的典礼，反正有着一套神秘古怪的仪式。">查看中文翻译</div>

So she ignored my mother's advice and took the heavy bags and their two thousand dollars to China. And when their China tour finally arrived in Hangzhou, the whole family from Ningbo was there to meet them.

When the train pulled out of Hangzhou the next day, the Hsus found themselves depleted of some nine thousand dollars' worth of goodwill. Months later, after an inspiring Christmastime service at the First Chinese Baptist Church, Auntie An-mei tried to recoup her loss by saying it truly was more blessed to give than to receive, and my mother agreed, her longtime friend had blessings for at least several lifetimes.</div>

She did housework for an old retired piano teacher down the hall who gave me lessons and free use of a piano to practice on in exchange.
