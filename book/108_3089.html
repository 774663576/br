<div class="line_en">The Lanky One, by means of subtle gestures and signs, seems to want to convey to the woman that this is not quite as easy as it looks. The woman, with gestures that are comparatively unsubtle, seems to want to convey that it might have something to do with the moronic nature of the Lanky One in question.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove whips open the green floral curtains, which for many years Ove's wife has been nagging him to change. He sees a short, black-haired, and obviously foreign woman aged about thirty. She stands there gesticulating furiously at a similarly aged oversize blond lanky man squeezed into the driver's seat of a ludicrously small Japanese car with a trailer, now scraping against the exterior wall of Ove's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维掀开窗前的绿色碎花窗帘——多年来，妻子一直念叨着说要换掉。他看到一个矮个儿黑发的女人，显然是外国人，三十来岁。她站在那儿暴跳如雷地冲一个年龄相仿的金发瘦高个儿盲流比画着手势，那人卡在一辆小得过分的日本车里，车后挂一拖斗，正剐蹭着欧维家的排屋外墙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And who might you be?" Ove enquires.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你又是谁？”欧维问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, really? Doesn't look like it!" rages the pregnant woman, who is probably a foot and a half shorter than him. She tries to slap his arm with both hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦？真有这么回事？看起来不像呀！”目测比他矮半米的黑发孕妇边冲盲流吼着，边用双手手心拍着他的胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove stares silently at her for a few seconds. Then he turns to her husband, who's just managed to extract himself from the Japanese car and is approaching them with two hands thrown expressively into the air and an apologetic smile plastered across his face. He's wearing a knitted cardigan and his posture seems to indicate a very obvious calcium deficiency. He must be close to six and a half feet tall. Ove feels an instinctive skepticism towards all people taller than six feet; the blood can't quite make it all the way up to the brain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维默默瞪了她几秒钟。然后他朝那个盲流转过身，那人刚从日本车里挤出身来，双手愧疚地举在空中。脸上洋溢着歉意的微笑。他穿着一件针织开襟羊毛衫，他的姿势似乎表明缺钙非常明显。他一定有六英尺半高。欧维对所有身高超过六英尺的人都有一种本能的怀疑；血液不能一直流到大脑。【注：六英尺半，大概等于一米八五。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="然后她滔滔不绝地讲了半分钟，据欧维猜测，她讲的应该是脏话词汇发达的阿拉伯语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lanky One nods quickly, clearly keen to avoid further provocation of this unknown man. He turns to his wife as if he's expecting her to come to his aid. She doesn't look at all likely to do so. The Lanky One looks at Ove again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盲流飞快地点点头，现在他显然着了慌，不想再进一步惹恼眼前这个陌生人。于是他转身面对自己的太太，仿佛期待她的救援。她看上去完全没那个意思。盲流又看向欧维。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Lanky One scratches his head, as if he's got some tobacco caught in his tangled hair.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这也不能算花坛吧？”他一脸无所谓地笑着，用舌尖调整了一下唇烟的位置。“啊，来吧，那只是土，”他坚持说，好像欧维在跟他开玩笑似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="孕妇没有咧嘴，欧维也没有。她交叉着双臂，欧维双手叉着腰。盲流显然不知道该拿他的大拳头怎么办，于是他略带羞涩地把它们在身侧来回地甩，就像它们是布片缝的，可以随风飘荡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lanky One gives Ove a slightly startled glance, but he doesn't quite seem to have the nerve to reply. Instead he gets out of his car and stands beside it like a schoolboy in the dunce's corner. Ove points down the footpath between the row houses, towards the bicycle shed and the parking area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盲流略带惊恐地看看欧维，但似乎又不敢开口问为什么。只好钻出车来老老实实地站在一边，像个被罚站的小学生。欧维朝着排屋之间自行车棚和停车场的方向，指了指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get out of the car, I said!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说你给我出来！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course it's an automatic, Ove notes. Might have known. These morons would rather not have to drive their cars at all, let alone reverse into a parking space by themselves. He puts it into drive and inches forward. Should one really have a driver's license if one can't drive a real car rather than some Japanese robot vehicle? he wonders. Ove doubts whether someone who can't park a car properly should even be allowed to vote.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还是自动挡，当然啦，他心想。不用猜就知道。这些蠢蛋恨不得压根儿别开自己的车，欧维一边想着一边挂上前进挡开始向前开。如今的车最好都能自己上路。跟机器人似的。现在的人都不需要学侧方移位，这都搞不懂能拿驾照吗？啊？欧维才不信呢。欧维甚至高度怀疑连这都搞不懂的人是不是该给他选举权。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And with that, he goes into his house and closes the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他走进自己的房子，关上房门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stops halfway up the paved path between the house and his shed. He wrinkles his nose in the way men of his age do, the wrinkle traveling across his entire upper body. Then he sinks down on his knees, puts his face right up close to the paving stones, which he neatly and without exception removes and re-lays every other year, whether necessary or not. He sniffs again. Nods to himself. Stands up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在房子和他的独立储藏室之间，他停下脚步。就像他这样年龄的男人经常做的那样，使劲皱起鼻子，整个上半身跟着同时蜷缩起来。接着他屈膝，把整个脸凑到铺路石上，不管需不需要，他总是每两年把这些铺路石换一次。他又闻了闻，自顾自点头，起身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove goes to hang up his coat on the hook, among a sea of his wife's overcoats. Mutters "idiots" at the closed window just to be on the safe side. Then goes into his living room and stares up at his ceiling.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他在门厅里的凳子上坐下，一直坐到他可以冷静地干点别的。“要命的女人。”他心想。连杵在眼前的标牌都看不懂，她和她那一大家子来这儿到底干什么？社区内禁止车辆通行，地球人都知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The doorbell rings again. Ove turns around and stares at the bell as if it should be ashamed of itself. He takes a few steps into the hall, noting that his body is as stiff as set plaster. He can't tell if the creaking is coming from the floorboards or himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门铃又响了一声。欧维转过身瞪着门，就好像它干了什么难以启齿的勾当。他朝门厅走了两步，发现自己的身体僵硬得像干石膏。他不知道是地板还是自己在嘎吱作响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the doorbell goes it's like he's waking up from a warm slumber. He rubs his eyes hard, looks around as if worried that someone may have seen him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He doesn't know how long he stands there. He loses himself in his own thoughts. Floats away, as if in a mist. He's never been the sort of man who does that, has never been a daydreamer, but lately it's as if something's twisted up in his head. He's having increasing difficulty concentrating on things. He doesn't like it at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不知道自己在那儿站了多久。他沉浸在自己的脑海中，就像在迷雾中飘浮。他从来不是做白日梦的人，但最近他的脑子里就像有什么东西纠结了起来。他越来越难以集中注意力，这他一点儿都不喜欢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And what is it now?" he asks the door before he's even opened it, as if it had the answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">He goes into the living room. Shoves his hands in his pockets. Looks up at the ceiling. Stands there a good while and thinks about what sort of concrete-wall anchor bolt would be most suitable for the job. He stands there squinting until his eyes start hurting. He looks down, slightly confused, at his dented wristwatch. Then he looks out the window again and realizes that dusk has fallen. He shakes his head in resignation.</div>

<div class="line_en">You can't start drilling after dark, everyone knows that. He'd have to turn on all the lights and no one could say when they'd be turned off again.

<div class="line_en">He stands in the hall again. Stares at the warm container of chicken with rice and saffron as one might look at a box of nitroglycerin. Then he goes into the kitchen and puts it in the fridge. Not that he's habitually inclined to go around eating any old food provided by unknown, foreign kids on his doorstep. But in Ove's house one does not throw away food. As a point of principle.</div>

<div class="line_en">He goes down the stairs again. Puts back the attic key in its place behind the radiator in the little hall. "Taking it a bit easy," they said to him. A lot of thirty-one-year-old show-offs working with computers and refusing to drink normal coffee. An entire society where no one knows how to back up with a trailer. Then they come telling him he's not needed anymore. Is that reasonable?</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove packs up his useful-stuff box and takes it to the big upstairs hall. Fetches the key to the attic from its place behind the radiator in the little hall. Goes back and reaches up and opens the trapdoor to the attic. Folds down the ladder. Climbs up into the attic and puts the useful-stuff box in its place behind the kitchen chairs that his wife made him put up here because they creaked too much. They didn't creak at all. Ove knows very well it was just an excuse, because his wife wanted to get some new ones. As if that was all life was about. Buying kitchen chairs and eating in restaurants and carrying on.</div>
