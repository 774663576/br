<div class="line_en">By this river I want to stay, thought Siddhartha, it is the same which I have crossed a long time ago on my way to the childlike people, a friendly ferryman had guided me then, he is the one I want to go to, starting out from his hut, my path had led me at that time into a new life, which had now grown old and is dead-my present path, my present new life, shall also take its start there!</div>

<div class="line_en">Tenderly, he looked into the rushing water, into the transparent green, into the crystal lines of its drawing, so rich in secrets. Bright pearls he saw rising from the deep, quiet bubbles of air floating on the reflecting surface, the blue of the sky being depicted in it. With a thousand eyes, the river looked at him, with green ones, with white ones, with crystal ones, with sky-blue ones. How did he love this water, how did it delight him, how grateful was he to it! In his heart he heard the voice talking, which was newly awaking, and it told him: Love this water! Stay near it! Learn from it! Oh yes, he wanted to learn from it, he wanted to listen to it. He who would understand this water and its secrets, so it seemed to him, would also understand many other things, many secrets, all secrets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他深情地注视着奔腾的河水，注视着这一片清澈的碧绿，注视着这幅充满神秘的画面的透明线条。他看见从水底深处冒起明亮的珠串，平静的气泡飘浮在光洁如镜的水面上，湛蓝的天空倒映在水中。河水正用千万双眼睛盯着他，有绿色的、白色的、透明的，还有天蓝色的。他多么爱这条河呀！河水使得他心旷神怡，他多么感激它呀！他听见心里有个声音在说话，一个新觉醒的声音对他说：爱这条河吧！留在它这儿吧！向它学习吧！噢，是的，他愿意向它学，他愿意倾听它的声音。谁若是了解这条河及其秘密，他觉得，也就会懂得其他许多东西，许多秘密，所有秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But out of all secrets of the river, he today only saw one, this one touched his soul. He saw: this water ran and ran, incessantly it ran, and was nevertheless always there, was always at all times the same and yet new in every moment! Great be he who would grasp this, understand this! He understood and grasped it not, only felt some idea of it stirring, a distant memory, divine voices.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now I recognise you," he finally said. "At one time, you've slept in my hut, this was a long time ago, possibly more than twenty years ago, and you've been ferried across the river by me, and we parted like good friends. Haven't you've been a Samana? I can't think of your name any more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在我认出你来了。”他终于说道，“你在我的茅屋里睡过觉，那已经很久了，大概有二十多年了吧。当年我把你渡过河，然后咱们就像好朋友一样分手了。那时你不是沙门吗？你的名字我实在想不起来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So be welcome, Siddhartha. My name is Vasudeva." You will, so I hope, be my guest today as well and sleep in my hut, and tell me, where you're coming from and why these beautiful clothes are such a nuisance to you."</div>

<div class="line_en">They had reached the middle of the river, and Vasudeva pushed the oar with more strength, in order to overcome the current. He worked calmly, his eyes fixed in on the front of the boat, with brawny arms. Siddhartha sat and watched him, and remembered, how once before, on that last day of his time as a Samana, love for this man had stirred in his heart. Gratefully, he accepted Vasudeva's invitation. When they had reached the bank, he helped him to tie the boat to the stakes; after this, the ferryman asked him to enter the hut, offered him bread and water, and Siddhartha ate with eager pleasure, and also ate with eager pleasure of the mango fruits, Vasudeva offered him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Afterwards, it was almost the time of the sunset, they sat on a log by the bank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman about where he originally came from and about his life, as he had seen it before his eyes today, in that hour of despair. Until late at night, lasted his tale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，日落时分，他们俩坐在岸边一棵树的树干上，席特哈尔塔给船夫讲自己的出身和生活，那些绝望时刻的情景就像今天一样历历在目。他一直讲到夜深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vasudeva listened with great attention. Listening carefully, he let everything enter his mind, birthplace and childhood, all that learning, all that searching, all joy, all distress. This was among the ferryman's virtues one of the greatest: like only a few, he knew how to listen. Without him having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how Vasudeva let his words enter his mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience, did not add his praise or rebuke, was just listening. Siddhartha felt, what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to burry in his heart his own life, his own search, his own suffering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦苏代瓦全神贯注地听着。他仔细地倾听一切，出身和童年，所有的学习，所有的探索，所有的欢乐，所有的痛苦。善于倾听正是瓦苏代瓦的重要美德之一，能像他这样倾听的人不多。他并没有说一句话，讲述者就感觉到他把话全都听进去了。他安静、坦诚和期待地听着，一字不漏，没有丝毫的不耐烦，也不作褒贬，只是倾听。席特哈尔塔感到，能向这样一位倾听者诉说自己的生活、自己的探索和自己的烦恼，实在是一件幸事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But in the end of Siddhartha's tale, when he spoke of the tree by the river, and of his deep fall, of the holy Om, and how he had felt such a love for the river after his slumber, the ferryman listened with twice the attention, entirely and completely absorbed by it, with his eyes closed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当席特哈尔塔快讲到结尾时，他讲到河边那棵树，讲到自己的潦倒落魄，讲到那神圣的“唵”，以及他如何在睡了一觉之后对河水深感热爱。这时，船夫听得更是加倍专心了，他全神贯注地闭着眼睛听。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when Siddhartha fell silent, and a long silence had occurred, then Vasudeva said: "It is as I thought. The river has spoken to you. It is your friend as well, it speaks to you as well. That is good, that is very good. Stay with me, Siddhartha, my friend. I used to have a wife, her bed was next to mine, but she has died a long time ago, for a long time, I have lived alone. Now, you shall live with me, there is space and food for both."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到席特哈尔塔说完了，而且出现了很长时间的沉寂之后，瓦苏代瓦才说：“情况正如我所想，河水跟你说了话。它也是你的朋友，跟你说了话。这很好，好极了。你就留在我这儿吧，席特哈尔塔，我的朋友。以前我有过妻子，她的床铺就在我的旁边，可是她早就过世了，我已经单身生活了很久。你跟我一起过吧，住处和饭食都够两个人的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thank you," said Siddhartha, "I thank you and accept. And I also thank you for this, Vasudeva, for listening to me so well! These people are rare who know how to listen. And I did not meet a single one who knew it as well as you did. I will also learn in this respect from you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我感谢你，”席特哈尔塔说，“谢谢你，我同意。瓦苏代瓦，我还要感谢你这么专心地听我讲！善于倾听的人极少，我从没遇见过像你这样善于倾听的人。在这方面我也要向你学。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will learn it," spoke Vasudeva, "but not from me. The river has taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well. It knows everything, the river, everything can be learned from it. See, you've already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive downwards, to sink, to seek depth. The rich and elegant Siddhartha is becoming an oarsman's servant, the learned Brahman Siddhartha becomes a ferryman: this has also been told to you by the river. You'll learn that other thing from it as well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你会学到的，”瓦苏代瓦说，“但不是跟我学。是河水教会了我倾听，你也该跟它学。它什么都懂，这条河，可以向它学习一切。瞧，你已经向它学到了一点，那就是努力向下，沉下去，向深处探索，这很好。富有而高贵的席特哈尔塔变成划船的伙计，博学的婆罗门席特哈尔塔变成船夫，这也是河水点拨你的。你还会向它学到别的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vasudeva rose. "It is late," he said, "let's go to sleep. I can't tell you that other thing, oh friend. You'll learn it, or perhaps you know it already. See, I'm no learned man, I have no special skill in speaking, I also have no special skill in thinking. All I'm able to do is to listen and to be godly, I have learned nothing else. If I was able to say and teach it, I might be a wise man, but like this I am only a ferryman, and it is my task to ferry people across the river. I have transported many, thousands; and to all of them, my river has been nothing but an obstacle on their travels. They travelled to seek money and business, and for weddings, and on pilgrimages, and the river was obstructing their path, and the ferryman's job was to get them quickly across that obstacle. But for some among thousands, a few, four or five, the river has stopped being an obstacle, they have heard its voice, they have listened to it, and the river has become sacred to them, as it has become sacred to me. Let's rest now, Siddhartha."</div>

He learned to build an oar, and learned to mend the boat, and to weave baskets, and was joyful because of everything he learned, and the days and months passed quickly. But more than Vasudeva could teach him, he was taught by the river. Incessantly, he learned from it.

<div class="line_en">"This it is," said Siddhartha. "And when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real.

Many travellers, seeing the two ferrymen, thought they were brothers. Often, they sat in the evening together by the bank on the log, said nothing and both listened to the water, which was no water to them, but the voice of life, the voice of what exists, of what is eternally taking shape. And it happened from time to time that both, when listening to the river, thought of the same things, of a conversation from the day before yesterday, of one of their travellers, the face and fate of whom had occupied their thoughts, of death, of their childhood, and that they both in the same moment, when the river had been saying something good to them, looked at each other, both thinking precisely the same thing, both delighted about the same answer to the same question.</div>

<div class="line_en">The years passed by, and nobody counted them. Then, at one time, monks came by on a pilgrimage, followers of Gotama, the Buddha, who were asking to be ferried across the river, and by them the ferrymen were told that they were most hurriedly walking back to their great teacher, for the news had spread the exalted one was deadly sick and would soon die his last human death, in order to become one with the salvation. It was not long, until a new flock of monks came along on their pilgrimage, and another one, and the monks as well as most of the other travellers and people walking through the land spoke of nothing else than of Gotama and his impending death. And as people are flocking from everywhere and from all sides, when they are going to war or to the coronation of a king, and are gathering like ants in droves, thus they flocked, like being drawn on by a magic spell, to where the great Buddha was awaiting his death, where the huge event was to take place and the great perfected one of an era was to become one with the glory.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something about this ferry and the two ferrymen which was transmitted to others, which many of the travellers felt. It happened occasionally that a traveller, after having looked at the face of one of the ferrymen, started to tell the story of his life, told about pains, confessed evil things, asked for comfort and advice. It happened occasionally that someone asked for permission to stay for a night with them to listen to the river. It also happened that curious people came, who had been told that there were two wise men, or sorcerers, or holy men living by that ferry. The curious people asked many questions, but they got no answers, and they found neither sorcerers nor wise men, they only found two friendly little old men, who seemed to be mute and to have become a bit strange and gaga. And the curious people laughed and were discussing how foolishly and gullibly the common people were spreading such empty rumours.</div>

<div class="line_en">Often, Siddhartha thought in those days of the dying wise man, the great teacher, whose voice had admonished nations and had awoken hundreds of thousands, whose voice he had also once heard, whose holy face he had also once seen with respect. Kindly, he thought of him, saw his path to perfection before his eyes, and remembered with a smile those words which he had once, as a young man, said to him, the exalted one. They had been, so it seemed to him, proud and precocious words; with a smile, he remembered them. For a long time he knew that there was nothing standing between Gotama and him any more, though he was still unable to accept his teachings. No, there was no teaching a truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept. But he who had found, he could approve of any teachings, every path, every goal, there was nothing standing between him and all the other thousand any more who lived in that what is eternal, who breathed what is divine.</div>

A long time ago, she had retired from her previous life, had given her garden to the monks of Gotama as a gift, had taken her refuge in the teachings, was among the friends and benefactors of the pilgrims. Together with Siddhartha the boy, her son, she had gone on her way due to the news of the near death of Gotama, in simple clothes, on foot. With her little son, she was travelling by the river; but the boy had soon grown tired, desired to go back home, desired to rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining.</div>

But the boy started crying miserably, only interrupting it to kiss and hug his mother, and she also joined his loud screams for help, until the sound reached Vasudeva's ears, who stood at the ferry. Quickly, he came walking, took the woman on his arms, carried her into the boat, the boy ran along, and soon they all reached the hut, were Siddhartha stood by the stove and was just lighting the fire. He looked up and first saw the boy's face, which wondrously reminded him of something, like a warning to remember something he had forgotten.
