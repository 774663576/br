<div class="line_en">Everyone was cheerful as the Dawn Treader sailed from Dragon Island. They had fair winds as soon as they were out of the bay and came early next morning to the unknown land which some of them had seen when flying over the mountains while Eustace was still a dragon. It was a low green island inhabited by nothing but rabbits and a few goats, but from the ruins of stone huts, and from blackened places where fires had been, they judged that it had been peopled not long before. There were also some bones and broken weapons.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only other thing they found there was a little skin boat, or coracle, on the sands. It was made of hide stretched over a wicker framework. It was a tiny boat, barely four feet long, and the paddle which still lay in it was in proportion. They thought that either it had been made for a child or else that the people of that country had been Dwarfs. Reepicheep decided to keep it, as it was just the right size for him; so it was taken on board. They called that land Burnt Island, and sailed away before noon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在岛上另外找到的惟一东西是沙滩上一只小皮艇，又叫皮筏子。那是用生皮绷在一个柳条框架上做成的，是条小小的船，只有四英尺长，船上的桨还搁在那儿，倒也大小相称。他们心想，要么这船是造给孩子的，要么那地方的人是小矮人。雷佩契普决定留着这条船，因为这船的大小同它正合适，所以就把小船带上大船去了。他们把这地方称做火烧岛，中午前就开走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They all held their breath, for it is not at all nice to be pursued by an unknown something either on land or sea. But what it turned out to be was far worse than anyone had suspected. Suddenly, only about the length of a cricket pitch from their port side, an appalling head reared itself out of the sea. It was all greens and vermilions with purple blotches -- except where shell fish clung to it -- and shaped rather like a horse's, though without ears. It had enormous eyes, eyes made for staring through the dark depths of the ocean, and a gaping mouth filled with double rows of sharp fish-like teeth. It came up on what they first took to be a huge neck, but as more and more of it emerged everyone knew that this was not its neck but its body and that at last they were seeing what so many people have foolishly wanted to see -- the great Sea Serpent. The folds of its gigantic tail could be seen far away, rising at intervals from the surface. And now its head was towering up higher than the mast.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every man rushed to his weapon, but there was nothing to be done, the monster was out of reach. "Shoot! Shoot!" cried the Master Bowman, and several obeyed, but the arrows glanced off the Sea Serpent's hide as if it was ironplated. Then, for a dreadful minute, everyone was still, staring up at its eyes and mouth and wondering where it would pounce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人人都奔去拿武器，可是毫无办法，这怪物高不可攀。“射！射！”弓箭手的头头叫道。有几个人听命射了，可是箭在海蛇皮上一擦而过，仿佛射在铁甲上似的。这时，大家都一动不动，抬眼盯着海蛇的眼睛和大嘴，提心吊胆了一阵子，不知它会向哪儿扑来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it didn't pounce. It shot its head forward across the ship on a level with the yard of the mast. Now its head was just beside the fighting top. Still it stretched and stretched till its head was over the starboard bulwark. Then down it began to come -- not on to the crowded deck but into the water, so that the whole ship was under an arch of serpent. And almost at once that arch began to get smaller: indeed on the starboard the Sea Serpent was now almost touching the Dawn Treader's side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不料它竟没扑来。它把脑袋沿着桅杆的帆桁探过船身。眼下它的脑袋就在桅顶观测台旁边了。可是它还不断伸长，一直把脑袋伸到右舷的舷墙上。接着又开始往下伸——不是伸向挤满人的甲板，而是伸向水里，这一来，整条船就在蛇身的弧圈下了。这个弧圈几乎一下子就缩小了些；右舷方面的海蛇身子这时几乎碰到了舷侧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eustace (who had really been trying very hard to behave well, till the rain and the chess put him back) now did the first brave thing he had ever done. He was wearing a sword that Caspian had lent him. As soon as the serpent's body was near enough on the starboard side he jumped on to the bulwark and began hacking at it with all his might. It is true that he accomplished nothing beyond breaking Caspian's second-best sword into bits, but it was a fine thing for a beginner to have done.</div>

<div class="line_en">The brute had made a loop of itself round the Dawn Treader and was beginning to draw the loop tight. When it got quite tight -- snap! -- there would be floating matchwood where the ship had been and it could pick them out of the water one by one. Their only chance was to push the loop backward till it slid over the stern; or else (to put the same thing another way) to push the ship forward out of the loop.</div>

<div class="line_en">Others would have joined him if at that moment Reepicheep had not called out, "Don't fight! Push!" It was so unusual for the Mouse to advise anyone not to fight that, even in that terrible moment, every eye turned to him. And when he jumped up on to the bulwark, forward of the snake, and set his little furry back against its huge scaly, slimy back, and began pushing as hard as he could, quite a number of people saw what he meant and rushed to both sides of the ship to do the same. And when, a moment later, the Sea Serpent's head appeared again, this time on the port side, and this time with its back to them, then everyone understood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reepicheep alone had, of course, no more chance of doing this than of lifting up a cathedral, but he had nearly killed himself with trying before others shoved him aside. Very soon the whole ship's company except Lucy and the Mouse (which was fainting) was in two long lines along the two bulwarks, each man's chest to the back of the man in front, so that the weight of the whole line was in the last man, pushing for their lives. For a few sickening seconds (which seemed like hours) nothing appeared to happen. Joints cracked, sweat dropped, breath came in grunts and gasps. Then they felt that the ship was moving. They saw that the snake-loop was further from the mast than it had been. But they also saw that it was smaller. And now the real danger was at hand. Could they get it over the poop, or was it already too tight? Yes. It would just fit. It was resting on the poop rails. A dozen or more sprang up on the poop. This was far better. The Sea Serpent's body was so low now that they could make a line across the poop and push side by side. Hope rose high till everyone remembered the high carved stern, the dragon tail, of the Dawn Treader. It would be quite impossible to get the brute over that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷佩契普势单力薄，当然休想办到，这无异蚍蜉撼大树，到别人把它推到一边时它已用尽力气，差点送了命。一会儿工夫全船人员，除了露茜和晕倒的老鼠之外，都沿着两边舷墙，排成两条长队，个个前胸贴后背，这样整列队伍的重量都落在队尾一个人身上，大家拼命推。推了几秒钟，难受得像推了好几个小时，看看还是毫无结果。大伙儿关节散了架，汗珠往下淌，哼哼嘿嘿，直喘大气。这时他们觉得船在动了。他们看见蛇圈离桅杆比先前更远了。不过他们也看到蛇圈收小了。这下子真正的危险就迫在眉睫了。他们能不能让船尾楼穿过这个圈套？这个圈套是不是已经太紧了？是啊，这个圈套正好绕着，贴着船尾楼的栏杆。十几个人跳上船尾楼去。这样就好得多了。这会儿海蛇的身体很低，他们可以在船尾楼对面排成一排，并肩一齐推。大家满怀希望，后来忽然又想起黎明踏浪号高耸的雕花船尾那个龙尾。要让龙尾摆脱那个圈套可万万办不到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy, who knew where everything was, heard him where she was standing on the main deck staring up at the poop. In a few seconds she had been below, got the axe, and was rushing up the ladder to the poop. But just as she reached the top there came a great crashing noise like a tree coming down and the ship rocked and darted forward. For at that very moment, whether because the Sea Serpent was being pushed so hard, or because it foolishly decided to draw the noose tight, the whole of the carved stern broke off and the ship was free.</div>

<div class="line_en">The others were too exhausted to see what Lucy saw. There, a few yards behind them, the loop of Sea Serpent's body got rapidly smaller and disappeared into a splash. Lucy always said (but of course she was very excited at the moment, and it may have been only imagination) that she saw a look of idiotic satisfaction on the creature's face. What is certain is that it was a very stupid animal, for instead of pursuing the ship it turned its head round and began nosing all along its own body as if it expected to find the wreckage of the Dawn Treader there. But the Dawn Treader was already well away, running before a fresh breeze, and the men lay and sat panting and groaning all about the deck, till presently they were able to talk about it, and then to laugh about it. And when some rum had been served out they even raised a cheer; and everyone praised the valour of Eustace (though it hadn't done any good) and of Reepicheep.</div>

Caspian agreed, but a long row against the gale did not bring them to the land before evening. By the last light of that day they steered into a natural harbour and anchored, but no one went ashore that night. In the morning they found themselves in the green bay of a rugged, lonely-looking country which sloped up to a rocky summit. From the windy north beyond that summit clouds came streaming rapidly.
