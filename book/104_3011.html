<div class="line_en">She had entered my world, umber and black Humberland, with rash curiosity; she surveyed it with a shrug of amused distaste; and it seemed to me now that she was ready to turn away from it with something akin to plain repulsion. Never did she vibrate under my touch, and a strident "what d'you think you are doing?" was all I got for my pains. To the wonderland I had to offer, my fool preferred the corniest movies, the most cloying fudge. To think that between a Hamburger and a Humburger, she would -- invariably, with icy precision -- plump for the former. There is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child. Did I mention the name of that milk bar I visited a moment ago? It was, of all things, The Frigid Queen.</div>

<div class="line_en">The able psychiatrist who studies my case -- and whom by now Dr. Humbert has plunged, I trust, into a state of leporine fascination -- is no doubt anxious to have me take my Lolita to the seaside and have me find there, at last, the "gratification" of a lifetime urge, and release from the "subconscious" obsession of an incomplete childhood romance with the initial little Miss Lee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="负责我的病案的精神病医生——至此我相信亨伯特博士已使他陷入狂想的状态——坦率地催促我带着我的洛丽塔去海边，使我终于在彼地找到毕生欲望的满足，彻底解脱儿时与幼小的李小姐未完成的浪漫史“潜意识”的困扰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For there is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet. It is hors concours, that bliss, it belongs to another class, another plane of sensitivity. Despite our tiffs, despite her nastiness, despite all the fuss and faces she made, and the vulgarity, and the danger, and the horrible hopelessness of it all, I still dwelled deep in my elected paradise -- a paradise whose skies were the color of hell-flames -- but still a paradise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实就是这样。因为世上没有一种至高无上的幸福能与爱抚性感少女相比。那种至福至喜是绝无仅有的，它是属于另一种感觉平面的。尽管我们有争吵，尽管她言语粗鄙，尽管她吹毛求疵，动不动变颜变色，尽管这一切都卑劣、危险、根本无望，我仍然沉醉在我自选的天堂里——天堂的穹空布满地狱之火的颜色——但仍然是天堂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, comrade, let me tell you that I did look for a beach, though I also have to confess that by the time we reached its mirage of gray water, so many delights had already been granted me by my traveling companion that the search for a Kingdom by the Sea, a Sublimated Riviera, or whatnot, far from being the impulse of the subconscious, had become the rational pursuit of a purely theoretical thrill. The angels knew it, and arranged things accordingly. A visit to a plausible cove on the Atlantic side was completely messed up by foul weather. A thick damp sky, muddy waves, a sense of boundless but somehow matter-of-fact mist -- what could be further removed from the crisp charm, the sapphire occasion and rosy contingency of my Riviera romance? A couple of semitropical beaches on the Gulf, though bright enough, were starred and spattered by venomous beasties and swept by hurricane winds. Finally, on a Californian beach, facing the phantom of the Pacific, I hit upon some rather perverse privacy in a kind of cave whence you could hear the shrieks of a lot of girl scouts taking their first surf bath on a separate part of the beach, behind rotting trees; but the fog was like a wet blanket, and the sand was gritty and clammy, and Lo was all gooseflesh and grit, and for the first time in my life I had as little desire for her as for a manatee. Perhaps, my learned readers may perk up if I tell them that even had we discovered a piece of sympathetic seaside somewhere, it would have come too late, since my real liberation had occurred much earlier: at the moment, in point of fact, when Annabel Haze, alias Dolores Lee, alias Loleeta, had appeared to me, golden and brown, kneeling, looking up, on that shoddy veranda, in a kind of fictitious, dishonest, but eminently satisfactory seaside arrangement (although there was nothing but a second-rate lake in the neighborhood).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好吧，同志，让我告诉你，我确实想觅一处海滨，尽管我必须承认在我们到达那片灰色的海市蜃楼时，我的旅伴已赐与了我许多的快乐，以至寻找“海边王国”、“净化的里维埃拉”等等已远非潜意识的冲动，而成了对纯理论的精神享乐的理智追求。天使们知道一切，天遂人意。对大西洋岸一个生动的小海湾的拜访却被恶劣的天气彻底搅乱了。阴霾重重的天空，泥浊的海浪，迷茫却又实在的雾气——但还有什么能将我从我的里维埃拉浪漫史的新鲜魅力、蓝宝石色良机和玫瑰色巧遇边驱走呢？湾内一对亚热带海岸，尽管位置很隐蔽了，还是有幼小的毒兽向里窥视继而掉落下去，也免不了飓风的扫荡。最后，在加利福尼亚一片与太平洋幻影相对的海滨，我碰巧在一个洞穴里遇上些荒谬的秘事，听到了一大群正隐在隔壁海滨的枯树后洗第一次海澡的女童子军的尖叫；象一块湿漉的绒毯，沙砾又硬又粘，洛起了一身鸡皮疙瘩，连连磨牙打颤，我平生第一次对她象对海牛一样，不存欲望。我博学的读者们可能会振作起来，假如我告诉他们即使我们在哪里发现了一片合谐的海岸，那也为时已晚，因为我真正的解放已先此发生了；那时，实际是，当阿娜贝尔。黑兹，化名多洛雷斯·李，化名洛丽塔。金褐色的，跪卧著，仰着头，在那个劣等游廊上出现在我的面前，那真是做作的、失实的，却又颇令人满意的海滨安排（尽管除了旁边的一个二流湖便一无佳处）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So much for those special sensations, influenced, if not actually brought about, by the tenets of modern psychiatry. Consequently, I turned away -- I headed my Lolita away -- from beaches which were either too bleak when lone, or too populous when ablaze. However, in recollection, I suppose, of my hopeless hauntings of public parks in Europe, I was still keenly interested in outdoor activities and desirous of finding suitable playgrounds in the open where I had suffered such shameful privations. Here, too, I was to be thwarted. The disappointment I must now register (as I gently grade my story into an expression of the continuous risk and dread that ran through my bliss) should in no wise reflect on the lyrical, epic, tragic but never Arcadian American wilds. They are beautiful, heart-rendingly beautiful, those wilds, with a quality of wide-eyed, unsung, innocent surrender that my lacquered, toy-bright Swiss villages and exhaustively lauded Alps no longer possess. Innumerable lovers have clipped and kissed on the trim turf of old-world mountainsides, on the innerspring moss, by a handy, hygienic rill, on rustic benches under the initialed oaks, and in so many cabanes in so many beech forests. But in the Wilds of America the open-air lover will not find it easy to indulge in the most ancient of ail crimes and pastimes. Poisonous plants burn his sweetheart's buttocks, nameless insects sting his; sharp items of the forest floor prick his knees, insects hers; and all around there abides a sustained rustle of potential snakes -- que dis-je, of semi-extinct dragons!-- while the crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling, in a hideous green crust, to gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些特殊的感觉真是太多了，如果它的不是自然生发的，则是受现代精神病学的影响。最后，我离开了——牵着我的洛丽塔离开了——孤独时既不过分萧瑟，亢奋时也不显过分熙攘的海滨。但是，每当我回忆起无望地萦绕于心的欧洲公园时，我想我仍对户外活动兴趣盎然，渴求觅到合适的露天活动场地，尽管这些地方令我吃尽苦头。在这方面，同样，我依旧遭到阻挠。我现在要记下的失望（我温和地将我的故事升级为讲述连续不断的冒险和穿透我的欲望的恐怖）丝毫也不影响片富于抒情性、史诗性、悲剧性，但绝对不具有阿卡狄亚性的美国荒野。她们是美丽的、令人心碎的美丽荒野，那种天真未凿、不事歌颂的倔强品质是我那似涂漆玩具一样鲜亮的瑞士村庄和久经交口赞誉的阿尔卑斯山早已失落的。在半山腰平整的草地上；在洞泉的苔藓上，在近旁清纯的小溪畔，在原始橡树下的圆木长凳上，在那么多山毛榉林里的那么多窝棚里，数不清的情侣拥抱过、亲吻过。但在美国荒野里，露天的情人会发现要沉湎于最古老的罪恶和娱乐并不容易。有害植物烧坏他心上人的屁股，叫不上名的昆虫螫了他的臀部；森林地上尖利的东西刺破他的膝盖，昆虫又叮她的，茫茫四周不断有莽蛇不绝于耳的沙沙声——要我说，是半灭种的龙！——在可怕的草皮里，还有似蟹摸样的野花籽，仿佛是袜带缠满他们的黑色袜和沾上泥泞的白袜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am exaggerating a little. One summer noon, just below timberline, where heavenly-hued blossoms that I would fain call larkspur crowded all along a purly mountain brook, we did find, Lolita and I, a secluded romantic spot, a hundred feet or so above the pass where we had left our car. The slope seemed un-trodden. A last panting pine was taking a well-earned breather on the rock it had reached. A marmot whistled at us and withdrew. Beneath the lap-robe I had spread for Lo, dry flowers crepitated softly. Venus came and went. The jagged cliff crowning the upper talus and a tangle of shrubs growing below us seemed to offer us protection from sun and man alike. Alas, I had not reckoned with a faint side trail that curled up in cagey fashion among the shrubs and rocks a few feet from us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是有些夸张。一个夏天的中午，就在树际线以下，颜色极深的花朵（我乐意称其为飞燕草）拥挤在一条欢闹的山溪边，洛丽塔和我，竟真地发现了一个与世隔绝的浪漫地，距我们停放汽车的那个路口约一百英尺远。这一处山坡仿佛从未有人迹踏过。最后一棵一息尚存的松树抓住了一块巨石上方的呼吸孔。一只山拨鼠冲我鸣叫又缩了回去。我给洛铺好漆布，干皱的花在下面发出一连串轻微的噼啪声。维纳斯来了又走了。为斜坡加冠的锯齿形悬崖峭壁和蔓延在我们脚下的一大团乱糟糟灌木，仿佛要保护我们躲避太阳，同时也躲避开人类。啊，我没有注意到离我们几英尺远有一条侧路在灌木和石块中若隐若现地蜿蜒着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was then that we came closer to detection than ever before, and no wonder the experience curbed forever my yearning for rural amours.</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember the operation was over, all over, and she was weeping in my arms;-- a salutory storm of sobs after one of the fits of moodiness that had become so frequent with her in the course of that otherwise admirable year! I had just retracted some silly promise she had forced me to make in a moment of blind impatient passion, and there she was sprawling and sobbing, and pinching my caressing hand, and I was laughing happily, and the atrocious, unbelievable, unbearable, and, I suspect, eternal horror that I know now was still but a dot of blackness in the blue of my bliss; and so we lay, when with one of those jolts that have ended by knocking my poor heart out of its groove, I met the unblinking dark eyes of two strange and beautiful children, faunlet and nymphet, whom their identical flat dark hair and bloodless cheeks proclaimed siblings if not twins. They stood crouching and gaping at us, both in blue play-suits, blending with the mountain blossoms. I plucked at the lap-robe for desperate concealment -- and within the same instant, something that looked like a polka-dotted pushball among the undergrowth a few paces away, went into a turning motion which was transformed into the gradually rising figure of a stout lady with a raven-black bob, who automatically added a wild lily to her bouquet, while staring over her shoulder at us from behind her lovely carved bluestone children.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that I have an altogether different mess on my conscience, I know that I am a courageous man, but in those days I was not aware of it, and I remember being surprised by my own coolness. With the quiet murmured order one gives a sweat-stained distracted cringing trained animal even in the worst of plights (what mad hope or hate makes the young beast's flanks pulsate, what black stars pierce the heart of the tamer!), I made Lo get up, and we decorously walked, and then indecorously scuttled down to the car. Behind it a nifty station wagon was parked, and a handsome Assyrian with a little blue-black beard, un monsieur trés bien, in silk shirt and magenta slacks, presumably the corpulent botanist's husband, was gravely taking the picture of a signboard giving the altitude of the pass. It was well over 10,000 feet and I was quite out of breath; and with a scrunch and a skid we drove off, Lo still struggling with her clothes and swearing at me in language that I never dreamed little girls could know, let alone use.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were other unpleasant incidents. There was the movie theatre once, for example. Lo at the time still had for the cinema a veritable passion (it was to decline into tepid condescension during her second high school year). We took in, voluptuously and indiscriminately, oh, I don't know, one hundred and fifty or two hundred programs during that one year, and during some of the denser periods of movie-going we saw many of the news-reels up to half-a-dozen times since the same weekly one went with different main pictures and pursued us from town to town. Her favorite kinds were, in this order: musicals, underworlders, westerners. In the first, real singers and dancers had unreal stage careers in an essentially grief-proof sphere of existence where-from death and truth were banned, and where, at the end, white-haired, dewy-eyed, technically deathless, the initially reluctant father of a show-crazy girl always finished by applauding her apotheosis on fabulous Broadway. The underworld was a world apart: there, heroic newspapermen were tortured, telephone bills ran to billions, and, in a robust atmosphere of incompetent marksmanship, villains were chased through sewers and storehouses by pathologically fearless cops (I was to give them less exercise). Finally there was the mahogany landscape, the florid-faced, blue-eyed roughriders, the prim pretty schoolteacher arriving in Roaring Gulch, the rearing horse, the spectacular stampede, the pistol thrust through the shivered windowpane, the stupendous fist fight, the crashing mountain of dusty old-fashioned furniture, the table used as a weapon, the timely somersault, the pinned hand still groping for the dropped bowie knife, the grunt, the sweet crash of fist against chin, the kick in the belly, the flying tackle; and immediately after a plethora of pain that would have hospitalized a Hercules (I should know by now), nothing to show but the rather becoming bruise on the bronzed cheek of the warmed-up hero embracing his gorgeous frontier bride. I remember one matinee in a small airless theatre crammed with children and reeking with the hot breath of popcorn. The moon was yellow above the neckerchiefed crooner, and his finger was on his strumstring, and his foot was on a pine log, and I had innocently encircled Lo's shoulder and approached my jawbone to her temple, when two harpies behind us started muttering the queerest things -- I do not know if I understood aright, but what I thought I did, made me withdraw my gentle hand, and of course the rest of the show was fog to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有其他一些不愉快的意外事。比如有一次是在电影院。洛那时对电影仍然热情不衰（上高校二年级期间，这种热情曾下跌）。我们真是过得醉生梦死，昏天黑地，噢，我不知道，那一年我们为参观旅程安排了一百五十或二百个项目，而在更频繁稠密的看电影阶段里，大部分新闻短片我们都是看过六遍，因为这种电影主画面一周更换一次，便总是尾随我们从一个城市到另一个城市。她最喜欢的电影类是按如下顺序排列的：音乐件，下层社会片和西部片。在第一类电影里，真正的歌手和舞蹈者在抗忧怨的银幕天地度过的是不真实的舞台生涯，死亡和真理在此均遭禁忌，而头发已白却仍天真、特意安排成未死的、最初总是不那么赞成女儿为电影神魂颠倒的父亲，结尾总是他在寓言般的百老汇向他的神圣理想欢呼。下层社会的电影表现的是分裂的社会：英雄的记者惨遭毒手，电话汇费涨到亿万，在射术不佳却相当粗野的气氛中，恶棍们被身患重仍无所畏惧的警察追得在下水道和商店里乱窜（我要少给他们点作业）。最后是西部片中红褐色的风光，那些满面通红、蓝眼睛的野骑手和一本正经、漂亮的学校老师出现在“咆哮峡谷”里，仰啸的马，壮观的奔腾，手枪戳透颤悠悠的窗玻璃，巨大的拳头打来打去，积满灰尘的旧式家具倒成奇异的山堆，当作武器用的桌子，恰如其份的跟头，藏着利器的手还摸索着掉落的钢制单刃猎刀，猪似的咕噜声，拳头朝下颚熟练的出打，腹部挨踢，以及飞来的器械；流血过多的痛苦刚刚过后，就是把海克力斯送进医院（我现在应该知道了），没什么可演的了，就剩下那个重新振作的英雄拥抱他璀灿的边疆新娘，青铜色的脸颊上还留有瘀伤斑斑。我记得在一家憋闷的小剧场里看过一场午后剧，剧场里挤满了孩子，弥漫着炸玉米花的热气。月亮是黄的，悬在戴围巾的男歌手头上，他的身影映在他的琴弦上，他的脚站在一棵松木上，而我则不自觉地搂住洛的肩膀，脸颊移向她的太阳穴，这时我们后边两个色迷迷的恶棍开始嘀咕这最可疑的事——我不知道我是否理解对了，但我意识到了我的所做所为，于是缩回了我温情的手，当然，后来演的一切在我看来都仿佛是一片浓雾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another jolt I remember is connected with a little burg we were traversing at night, during our return journey. Some twenty miles earlier I had happened to tell her that the day school she would attend at Beardsley was a rather high-class, non-coeducational one, with no modern nonsense, whereupon Lo treated me to one of those furious harangues of hers where entreaty and insult, self-assertion and double talk, vicious vulgarity and childish despair, were interwoven in an exasperating semblance of logic which prompted a semblance of explanation from me. Enmeshed in her wild words (swell chance… I'd be a sap if I took your opinion seriously… Stinker… You can't boss me… I despise you… and so forth), I drove through the slumbering town at a fifty-mile-per-hour pace in continuance of my smooth highway swoosh, and a twosome of patrolmen put their spotlight on the car, and told me to pull over. I shushed Lo who was automatically raving on. The men peered at her and me with malevolent curiosity. Suddenly all dimples, she beamed sweetly at them, as she never did at my orchideous masculinity; for, in a sense, my Lo was even more scared of the law than I -- and when the kind officers pardoned us and servilely we crawled on, her eyelids closed and fluttered as she mimicked limp prostration.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, I have learned a few odds and ends. Alabama prohibits a guardian from changing the ward's residence without an order of the court; Minnesota, to whom I take off my hat, provides that when a relative assumes permanent care and custody of any child under fourteen, the authority of a court does not come into play. Query: is the stepfather of a gaspingly adorable pubescent pet, a stepfather of only one month's standing, a neurotic widower of mature years and small but independent means, with the parapets of Europe, a divorce and a few madhouses behind him, is he to be considered a relative, and thus a natural guardian? And if not, must I, and could I reasonably dare notify some Welfare Board and file a petition (how do you file a petition?), and have a court's agent investigate meek, fishy me and dangerous Dolores Haze? The many books on marriage, rape, adoption and so on, that I guiltily consulted at the public libraries of big and small towns, told me nothing beyond darkly insinuating that the state is the super-guardian of minor children. Pilvin and Zapel, if I remember their names right, in an impressive volume on the legal side of marriage, completely ignored stepfathers with motherless girls on their hands and knees. My best friend, a social service monograph (Chicago, 1936), which was dug out for me at great pains from a dusty storage recess by an innocent old spinster, said "There is no principle that every minor must have a guardian; the court is passive and enters the fray only when the child's situation becomes conspicuously perilous." A guardian, I concluded, was appointed only when he expressed his solemn and formal desire; but months might elapse before he was given notice to appear at a hearing and grow his pair of gray wings, and in the meantime the fair daemon child was legally left to her own devices which, after all, was the case of Dolores Haze. Then came the hearing. A few questions from the bench, a few reassuring answers from the attorney, a smile, a nod, a light drizzle outside, and the appointment was made. And still I dared not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噢，我只是零零星星知道一些，阿拉巴马州禁止监护人不经法院准许就擅改监护住处；明尼苏达洲，我要向她脱帽致意，规定亲属对十四岁以下儿童承担永久性保护和监督权，法院对此无裁决权。疑问：一个可爱的青春期宝贝的继父，只做过一个月的继父，年龄成熟、小有独立财产、只是过于神经质的鳏夫，身后有一段居在欧洲、一次离婚和进行过几所精神病院的历史，他能否被视为亲属，并因此自然被视为保护人吗？如果若，我是不是应该并且能够有充足理由去向“福利理事会”提出申请（我该怎样提出申请？），而后让法院职员调查温顺、可疑的我和危险的多洛雪斯·黑兹？许多关于婚姻、强奸、收养等等的书，我都负着罪到大大小小的城市公共图书馆请教过了，书中除了暗示这种情况是未成年孩子的超级监护，便常常不了了之。皮尔温和扎佩尔，如果这两个名字我没记错的话，是在一部感人的讲合法婚姻的大卷书里出现的，他们却完全无视那些丧母女童的继父的处境，前者既受后者监护又非后者所能控制。我最好的朋友，一位天真的老处女，满怀深深的痛苦从一间积满尘土的储藏室里为我挖掘出一篇社会服务方面的专论（《芝加哥》1936），专论说道：“并没有原则规定每位儿童都必须有一位保护人；法院是被动的，而且只在儿童处于显而易见十分危险的境地才参与事情冲突。”我总结道，只有在某人提出其严肃、正式的请求时才能被指定为保护人；不过，在他接到听诉通知且插上一对快乐的羽翼之前，几个月的时光都溜走了；而在这几个月中对那漂亮却凶狠的孩子的诡计，根据法律他却只能听之任之；后来，这终于成了多洛雷斯·黑兹的情形。接下去的是听诉，来自长板凳那边的几个问题，来自律师那边的几个令人信心大振的回答，一个微笑，一个点头，屋外的轻轻细雨，任命就此宣告完成。但我还是不敢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Friend Farlow, who was a lawyer of sorts and ought to have been able to give me some solid advice, was too much occupied with Jean's cancer to do anything more than what he had promised -- namely, to look after Charlotte's meager estate while I recovered very gradually from the shock of her death. I had conditioned him into believing Dolores was my natural child, and so could not expect him to bother his head about the situation. I am, as the reader must have gathered by now, a poor businessman; but neither ignorance nor indolence should have prevented me from seeking professional advice elsewhere. What stopped me was the awful feeling that if I meddled with fate in any way and tried to rationalize her fantastic gift, that gift would be snatched away like that palace on the mountain top in the Oriental tale which vanished whenever a prospective owner asked its custodian how come a strip of sunset sky was clearly visible from afar between black rock and foundation.</div>

<div class="line_en">I decided that at Beardsley (the site of Beardsley College for Women) I would have access to works of reference that I had not yet been able to study, such as Woerner's Treatise "On the American Law of Guardianship" and certain United States Children's Bureau Publications. I also decided that anything was better for Lo than the demoralizing idleness in which she lived. I could persuade her to do so many things -- their list might stupefy a professional educator; but no matter how I pleaded or stormed, I could never make her read any other book than the so-called comic books or stories in magazines for American females. Any literature a peg higher smacked to her of school, and though theoretically willing to enjoy A Girl of the Limber-lost or the Arabian Nights, or Little Women, she was quite sure she would not fritter away her "vacation" on such highbrow reading matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the days of that wild journey of ours, I doubted not that as father to Lolita the First I was a ridiculous failure. I did my best; I read and reread a book with the unintentionally biblical title Know Your Own Daughter, which I got at the same store where I bought Lo, for her thirteenth birthday, a de luxe volume with commercially "beautiful" illustrations, of Andersen's The Little Mermaid. But even at our very best moments, when we sat reading on a rainy day (Lo's glance skipping from the window to her wrist watch and back again), or had a quiet hearty meal in a crowded diner, or played a childish game of cards, or went shopping, or silently stared, with other motorists and their children, at some smashed, blood-bespattered car with a young woman's shoe in the ditch (Lo, as we drove on: "That was the exact type of moccasin I was trying to describe to that jerk in the store"); on all those random occasions, I seemed to myself as implausible a father as she seemed to be a daughter. Was, perhaps, guilty locomotion instrumental in vitiating our powers of impersonation? Would improvement be forthcoming with a fixed domicile and a routine schoolgirl's day?</div>

<div class="line_en">In my choice of Beardsley I was guided not only by the fact of there being a comparatively sedate school for girls located there, but also by the presence of the women's college. In my desire to get myself casé, to attach myself somehow to some patterned surface which my stripes would blend with, I thought of a man I knew in the department of French at Beardsley College; he was good enough to use my textbook in his classes and had attempted to get me over once to deliver a lecture. I had no intention of doing so, since, as I have once remarked in the course of these confessions, there are few physiques I loathe more than the heavy low-slung pelvis, thick calves and deplorable complexion of the average coed (in whom I see, maybe, the coffin of coarse female flesh within which my nymphets are buried alive); but I did crave for a label, a background, and a simulacrum, and, as presently will become clear, there was a reason, a rather zany reason, why old Gaston Godin's company would be particularly safe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, there was the money question. My income was cracking under the strain of our joy-ride. True, I clung to the cheaper motor courts; but every now and then, there would be a loud hotel de luxe, or a pretentious dude ranch, to mutilate our budget; staggering sums, moreover, were expended on sightseeing and Lo's clothes, and the old Haze bus, although a still vigorous and very devoted machine, necessitated numerous minor and major repairs. In one of our strip maps that has happened to survive among the papers which the authorities have so kindly allowed me to use for the purpose of writing my statement, I find some jottings that help me compute the following. During that extravagant year 1947-1948, August to August, lodgings and food cost us around 5,500 dollars; gas, oil and repairs, 1,234, and various extras almost as much; so that during about 150 days of actual motion (we covered about 27,000 miles!) plus some 200 days of interpolated standstills, this modest rentier spent around 8,000 dollars, or better say 10,000 because, unpractical as I am, I have surely forgotten a number of items.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so we rolled East, I more devastated than braced with the satisfaction of my passion, and she glowing with health, her bi-iliac garland still as brief as a lad's, although she had added two inches to her stature and eight pounds to her weight. We had been everywhere. We had really seen nothing. And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely, trustful, dreamy, enormous country that by then, in retrospect, was no more to us than a collection of dog-eared maps, ruined tour books, old tires, and her sobs in the night -- every night, every night -- the moment I feigned sleep.</div>
