<div class="line_en">Langdon dropped rung by rung down the creaking ladder… deeper and deeper beneath the floor of the Chigi Chapel. Into the Demon's hole, he thought. He was facing the side wall, his back to the chamber, and he wondered how many more dark, cramped spaces one day could provide. The ladder groaned with every step, and the pungent smell of rotting flesh and dampness was almost asphyxiating. Langdon wondered where the hell Olivetti was.</div>

<div class="line_en">Vittoria's outline was still visible above, holding the blowtorch inside the hole, lighting Langdon's way. As he lowered himself deeper into the darkness, the bluish glow from above got fainter. The only thing that got stronger was the stench.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还可以看到上头薇多利雅的身影，她抓著喷灯伸进洞内，帮兰登照路。他愈深入洞内的黑暗，来自上方的那片蓝光就愈微弱。唯一愈来愈强的，只有那股恶臭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Twelve rungs down, it happened. Langdon's foot hit a spot that was slippery with decay, and he faltered. Lunging forward, he caught the ladder with his forearms to avoid plummeting to the bottom. Cursing the bruises now throbbing on his arms, he dragged his body back onto the ladder and began his descent again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果下到第十二个梯级，出事了。兰登的脚碰巧踩到一个因木头腐朽而滑溜的地方，脚踉跄了一下。他往前一扑，两手前臂忙抓住那把木梯，免得摔下去。手臂淤血的地方抽痛著，他边诅咒边在梯子上重新站稳，然后再继续往下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The descent was slow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下去的路很慢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three rungs deeper, he almost fell again, but this time it was not a rung that caused the mishap. It was a bolt of fear. He had descended past a hollowed niche in the wall before him and suddenly found himself face to face with a collection of skulls. As he caught his breath and looked around him, he realized the wall at this level was honeycombed with shelflike openings -- burial niches -- all filled with skeletons. In the phosphorescent light, it made for an eerie collage of empty sockets and decaying rib cages flickering around him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又下了三级，他差点又摔下去了，但这回不是梯级造成的，而是突如其来的恐惧。他下降时经过了墙上一个空壁龛，赫然发现眼前面对著一堆骸骨。他喘著气看看四周，才发现这个高度的墙面上都是蜂窝状有如书架的孔穴──埋葬用的壁龛──全都塞满了骸骨。在微微磷光中，形成一片由空眼眶和腐朽胸廓肋骨组成的诡异拼贴，在他四周闪烁摇曳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Skeletons by firelight, he grimaced wryly, realizing he had quite coincidentally endured a similar evening just last month. An evening of bones and flames. The New York Museum of Archeology's candlelight benefit dinner -- salmon flambé in the shadow of a brontosaurus skeleton. He had attended at the invitation of Rebecca Strauss-one-time fashion model now art critic from theTimes, a whirlwind of black velvet, cigarettes, and not-so-subtly enhanced breasts. She'd called him twice since. Langdon had not returned her calls. Most ungentlemanly, he chided, wondering how long Rebecca Strauss would last in a stink-pit like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火光照耀的骷髅，他厌恶地皱了皱脸，想到碰巧就在上个月，他也经历了一个类似的夜晚。骨骸与火焰之夜。纽约考古博物馆的烛光募款晚餐会──在雷龙骨骸化石的阴影下吃鲑鱼浇白兰地火烧。是瑞贝卡．史卓斯邀请他一起去参加的，她当过时装模特儿，现在是《纽约时报》的艺评人，一袭光芒四射的黑色天鹅绒晚礼服，抽淤抽个不停，还有整得不甚含蓄的胸部。她后来打过两次电话给他，兰登没回电。太没绅士风度了，他责怪自己，很好奇瑞贝卡．史卓斯在眼前这种臭烘烘的黑坑裡能待得了多久。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon was relieved to feel the final rung give way to the spongy earth at the bottom. The ground beneath his shoes felt damp. Assuring himself the walls were not going to close in on him, he turned into the crypt. It was circular, about twenty feet across. Breathing through his sleeve again, Langdon turned his eyes to the body. In the gloom, the image was hazy. A white, fleshy outline. Facing the other direction. Motionless. Silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="感觉到最后一个梯级之下是底部软绵绵的泥土，兰登不禁鬆了口气。鞋底下的土地感觉很潮溼。他告诉自己，周围的墙面不会凑近把他包得更紧，然后转身面对著这个地下墓室。墓室是圆形的，直径约二十迟。兰登又用袖子遮住鼻子呼吸，眼光望向那具尸体。在一片黑暗中，影像很模糊，只有白色皮肤的轮廓，面朝著另一头，不动也不出声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon did not answer. He was now close enough to see it all. With a tremor of repulsion, he understood. The chamber seemed to contract around him. Emerging like a demon from the earthen floor was an old man… or at least half of him. He was buried up to his waist in the earth. Standing upright with half of him below ground. Stripped naked. His hands tied behind his back with a red cardinal's sash. He was propped limply upward, spine arched backward like some sort of hideous punching bag. The man's head lay backward, eyes toward the heavens as if pleading for help from God himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登没回答。他现在离得够近了，可以完全看清楚。随著一阵反感的战慄，他明白了。那个环绕著他的墓室似乎缩小了。像个恶魔似的从土裡冒出来的是个老人……或至少是半个老人。他胸部以下被埋在土裡，剥光了衣服。双手用枢机主教的红色腰繫带绑在背后。他被撑在那裡，软绵绵地朝上，脊椎骨后弯，像某种可怕的沙袋。男人的头也朝后仰，眼睛望著天上，好像在恳求上帝的帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Advancing through the murkiness of the crypt, Langdon tried to make sense of what he was looking at. The man had his back to Langdon, and Langdon could not see his face, but hedid indeed seem to be standing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon moved toward the body. I hope so, for his sake. As he drew to within a few feet, he looked down at the upturned eyes. They bulged outward, blue and bloodshot. Langdon leaned down to listen for breath but immediately recoiled. "For Christ's sake!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登走近那具尸体。希望如此，免得他受苦。走到离尸体只剩两三迟时，他朝下望著那对仰天的眼睛，发现蓝色双眼往外突出，充满血丝。兰登弯身听听看他有没有呼吸，但立刻又缩回身子。「老天在上！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hello?" Langdon choked through his sleeve. Nothing. As he drew nearer, he realized the man was very short. Too short…</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon did a double take. Earth. He had almost forgotten. The brands. Earth, Air, Fire, Water. The killer had threatened to brand each victim with one of the ancient elements of science. The first element wasEarth. From Santi's earthly tomb. Dizzy from the fumes, Langdon circled to the front of the body. As he did, the symbologist within him loudly reasserted the artistic challenge of creating the mythical ambigram. Earth? How? And yet, an instant later, it was before him. Centuries of Illuminati legend whirled in his mind. The marking on the cardinal's chest was charred and oozing. The flesh was seared black. La lingua pura…</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon almost gagged. "He's dead all right. I just saw the cause of death." The sight was gruesome. The man's mouth had been jammed open and packed solid with dirt. "Somebody stuffed a fistful of dirt down his throat. He suffocated."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登简直说不出话来了。「他已经死了。我刚刚才看到了死因。」那幅景象令人毛骨悚然，老人的嘴巴张开，裡面塞满了泥土。「有人朝他嘴裡硬塞了一把泥巴，堵住他的喉咙。他是闷死的。」">查看中文翻译</div>
