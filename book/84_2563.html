<div class="line_en">I didn't feel particularly brave as I approached my father in the Chapel that night. I saw my role as reconnaissance: I was there to relay information, to tell Dad that Shawn had threatened Audrey, because Dad would know what to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">I said that Shawn had made a joke about shooting Audrey, and that I thought it was because Audrey had confronted him about his behavior.

<div class="line_cn" title="我说肖恩开过一个要用枪射杀奥黛丽的玩笑，我觉得那是因为奥黛丽就他的行为与他当面对质过。爸爸盯着我，嘴唇上的皮肤绷得紧紧的。他喊母亲过来。她来了，神情忧郁。我不明白她为什么不敢直视我的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我跑去卫生间。我从脚到手指都在发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stared at the reflection. The mirror was mesmeric, with its triple panels trimmed with false oak. It was the same mirror I'd gazed into as a child, then as a girl, then as a youth, half woman, half girl. Behind me was the same toilet Shawn had put my head in, holding me there until I confessed I was a whore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我凝视着镜中的自己。这面镜子很迷人，有三块嵌板，镶着仿橡木边框。我在童年、少女时代、青春期、成年之后，凝视的都是这同一面镜子。身后的马桶还是肖恩将我的头按进去的那个，他曾在那里控制住我，直到我承认自己是个妓女。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had to strangle the sobs quickly -- Dad would never take me seriously if I couldn't -- so I stopped the bawling using the old methods: staring my face down in the mirror and scolding it for every tear. It was such a familiar process, that in doing it I shattered the illusion I'd been building so carefully for the past year. The fake past, the fake future, both gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我得迅速止住抽泣——否则爸爸永远不会认真对待我——所以我用老办法止住了痛哭：盯着镜中自己的脸，指责它流下的每滴眼泪。这个过程如此熟悉，做这件事时，我在过去一年精心营造的幻想破碎了。虚伪的过去，虚假的未来，全都消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had often locked myself in this bathroom after Shawn let me go. I would move the panels until they showed my face three times, then I would glare at each one, contemplating what Shawn had said and what he had made me say, until it all began to feel true instead of just something I had said to make the pain stop. And here I was still, and here was the mirror. The same face, repeated in the same three panels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩松开我后，我常常把自己锁在这个卫生间里。我会移动嵌板，直到镜子上出现三张我的脸，然后我会盯着每一张脸，思索肖恩说了什么，又逼我说了什么，直到一切都开始变得真实，而不是说了几句可以让疼痛停止的话。现在我仍然静静地站在这里，面对这面镜子。还是同样的脸，呈现在同样的三块嵌板中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had regained a fragile sense of calm, and I left the bathroom carrying that calmness delicately, as if it were a china plate balancing on my head. I walked slowly down the hall, taking small, even steps.</div>

<div class="line_en">Except it wasn't. This face was older, and floating above a soft cashmere sweater. But Dr. Kerry was right: it wasn't the clothes that made this face, this woman, different. It was something behind her eyes, something in the set of her jaw -- a hope or belief or conviction -- that a life is not a thing unalterable. I don't have a word for what it was I saw, but I suppose it was something like faith.</div>

<div class="line_en">I heard footsteps. Shawn had crossed the room and was now sitting next to me on the sofa. He waited for me to look at him, and when I didn't he reached out and took my hand. Gently, as if he were unfolding the petals of a rose, he peeled open my fingers and dropped something into them. I felt the cold of the blade before I saw it, and sensed the blood even before I glimpsed the red streak staining my palm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听到脚步声。肖恩已经穿过房间，现在正坐在我旁边的沙发上。他等着我抬头看他，但见我没抬头，他便伸出手来握住我的手。他轻轻地掰开我的手指，好像展开玫瑰花瓣一般，往里面放了什么东西。还没看到那是什么，我就感觉到了刀刃的寒意；甚至还未瞥见浸染我手掌的红色血迹，我就感觉到了鲜血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad told me to sit and I did. I don't know how long I waited, paralyzed with indecision, but I was still wondering if there was time to escape when the French doors opened and Shawn walked in. Suddenly the vast room felt tiny. I looked at my hands. I couldn't raise my eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸让我坐下，我照做了。我不知道自己等了多长时间，犹豫不决，不知所措，但我仍在考虑是否有时间逃走。这时法式大门开了，肖恩走了进来。突然间，宽敞的房间显得逼仄起来。我低头看着自己的手，无法抬起眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you're smart, Siddle Lister," Shawn said, "you'll use this on yourself. Because it will be better than what I'll do to you if you don't."</div>

<div class="line_en">The knife was small, only five or six inches long and very thin. The blade glowed crimson. I rubbed my thumb and index finger together, then brought them to my nose and inhaled. Metallic. It was definitely blood. Not mine -- he'd merely handed me the knife -- but whose?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刀子很小很薄，只有五六英寸长。刀片泛着深红色的血光。我用拇指和食指捏起它放到鼻子前，深吸一口气。一股金属的味道。毫无疑问，肯定是血。不是我的——他只是把刀递给了我——但那是谁的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stared at the blade. Dad began a lecture, pausing often so Mother could ratify his remarks. I heard voices, among them my own, chanting harmonies in an ancient hall. I heard laughter, the slosh of wine being poured from a bottle, the tinkle of butter knives tapping porcelain. I heard little of my father's speech, but I remember exactly, as if it were happening now, being transported over an ocean and back through three sunsets, to the night I had sung with my friends in the chamber choir. I must have fallen asleep, I thought. Too much wine. Too much Christmas turkey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我盯着刀刃。爸爸开始了长篇大论，不时停下来，让母亲认可他的话。我听见声音，古老的大礼堂里的吟唱和声，其中有我自己的声音。我听见欢声笑语，酒从瓶子里倒出来时的咕嘟咕嘟声，黄油刀碰在瓷器上叮当作响。我几乎没听到父亲说了什么，但我清楚地记得，仿佛此刻我正漂洋过海，穿越三次日落，回到我和朋友在室内唱诗班唱歌的那个夜晚。我想，我一定已经睡着了。喝了太多的酒。吃了太多的圣诞火鸡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I gaped at Mother, then at Shawn. I must have seemed like an idiot to them, but I couldn't grasp what was happening well enough to respond to it. I half-wondered if I should return to the bathroom and climb through the mirror, then send out the other girl, the one who was sixteen. She could handle this, I thought. She would not be afraid, like I was. She would not be hurt, like I was. She was a thing of stone, with no fleshy tenderness. I did not yet understand that it was this fact of being tender -- of having lived some years of a life that allowed tenderness -- that would, finally, save me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我目瞪口呆地看看母亲，又看看肖恩。在他们看来，我肯定像个傻瓜，但我不太明白到底发生了什么，也不知作何反应。我想着是否该回到卫生间，穿过镜子，派那个十六岁的女孩出来。我想，她能应付。她不会像我一样害怕。她不会像我一样受到伤害。她像块石头，没有血肉，没有柔软的内心。那时我还不明白一个事实，正是温柔——这些年来我所度过的一种温柔的生活——才会最终拯救我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The blood on my hands had dried. The knife lay on the carpet, forgotten by everyone except me. I tried not to stare at it. Whose was the blood? I studied my brother. He had not cut himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having decided I was dreaming, I did what one does in dreams: I tried to understand and use the rules of this queer reality. I reasoned with the strange shadows impersonating my family, and when reasoning failed, I lied. The impostors had bent reality. Now it was my turn. I told Shawn I hadn't said anything to Dad. I said things like "I don't know how Dad got that idea" and "Dad must have misheard me," hoping that if I rejected their percipience, they would simply dissipate. An hour later, when the four of us were still seated on the sofas, I finally came to terms with their physical persistence. They were here, and so was I.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我认定自己是在做梦，于是如梦中人一样行事：我努力理解并运用这奇怪的现实规则。我跟假扮我家人的陌生人影进行理论，当无法理论时，我就撒谎。骗子们已歪曲了现实，现在该轮到我了。我告诉肖恩，我不曾跟爸爸说任何事。我说了一些“我不知道爸爸怎么会有那种想法”和“爸爸一定是听错了”之类的话，希望如果我拒绝了他们的追根究底，他们就会消失。一个小时后，当我们四个仍坐在沙发上，我终于接受了他们的存在。他们在这里，所以我也在这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad had begun a new lecture, and this time I was present enough to hear it. He explained that little girls need to be instructed in how to behave appropriately around men, so as not to be too inviting. He'd noticed indecent habits in my sister's daughters, the oldest of whom was six. Shawn was calm. He had been worn down by the sheer duration of Dad's droning. More than that, he felt protected, justified, so that when the lecture finally ended he said to me, "I don't know what you said to Dad tonight, but I can tell just by looking at you that I've hurt you. And I'm sorry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸又开始了新一轮训话，这次我回过神来，能听见了。他解释说，小女孩需要接受指导，学习如何在男人身边举止得当，才不会招蜂引蝶。他已经注意到我姐姐的几个女儿有些习惯不太检点，她们中最大的才六岁。肖恩很平静。父亲冗长枯燥的唠叨让他精疲力竭。更重要的是，他觉得自己受到了保护，觉得自己有理，所以当父亲终于结束他的长篇大论时，他对我说：“我不知道今晚你对爸爸说了什么，但只是看着你，我就知道我曾伤害了你。我很抱歉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the real reason I didn't believe her was the knife. I'd seen my father and brothers put down dozens of dogs over the years -- strays mostly, that wouldn't stay out of the chicken coop. I'd never seen anyone use a knife on a dog. We shot them, in the head or the heart, so it was quick. But Shawn chose a knife, and a knife whose blade was barely bigger than his thumb. It was the knife you'd choose to experience a slaughter, to feel the blood running down your hand the moment the heart stopped beating. It wasn't the knife of a farmer, or even of a butcher. It was a knife of rage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我不相信她的真正原因还是那把刀。多年来，我目睹父亲和哥哥们放倒过很多狗——大多是不肯离开鸡舍的流浪狗。我从没见任何人动过刀子，都是一枪射中狗头或心脏，狗立刻毙命。但肖恩竟然选择一把刀，一把刀刃只比他的拇指大一点点的刀。你会选择这样的刀进行一场杀戮，在猎物的心脏停止跳动的那一刻，感受鲜血从掌心流过：那不是农夫的刀，甚至不是屠夫的刀。它是一把愤怒的刀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wanted to believe her but didn't. Diego had been killing Luke's chickens for more than a year. Besides, Diego was a purebred. Shawn had paid five hundred dollars for him. He could have been sold.</div>

<div class="line_en">From Mother I would later learn it was Diego, a German shepherd Shawn had purchased a few years before. The dog had been a pet, much beloved by Peter. After Dad had called, Shawn had stepped outside and slashed the dog to death, while his young son, only feet away, listened to the dog scream. Mother said the execution had nothing to do with me, that it had to be done because Diego was killing Luke's chickens. It was a coincidence, she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来我从母亲那里得知，死去的是迭戈，那是肖恩几年前买的一只德国牧羊犬。这只宠物狗一直深受彼得的喜爱。爸爸打过那通电话后，肖恩走到外面用刀把狗宰了，而他的儿子就在几英尺远的地方听着狗哀声嚎叫。母亲说，杀狗的事与我无关，不得不这么做是因为迭戈一直咬死卢克的鸡。她说，这只是个巧合。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know what happened in the days that followed. Even now, as I scrutinize the components of the confrontation -- the threat, the denial, the lecture, the apology -- it is difficult to relate them. When I considered it weeks later, it seemed I had made a thousand mistakes, driven a thousand knives into the heart of my own family. Only later did it occur to me that whatever damage was done that night might not have been done solely by me. And it was more than a year before I understood what should have been immediately apparent: that my mother had not confronted my father, and my father had not confronted Shawn. Dad had never promised to help me and Audrey. Mother had lied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道接下来几天发生了什么。即使是现在，再次审视那次对峙的每一个环节——威胁、否认、训诫、道歉——还是很难将它们联系起来。几周后再反思此事，我似乎犯了上千个错误，将一千把刀子插进了家人的心脏。后来我才意识到，那天晚上发生的任何伤害可能并不是我一个人造成的。而过了一年多，我才明白过来一个当时显而易见的事实：母亲从来没有跟父亲对质，父亲也从来没有与肖恩对质。父亲从未答应过要帮助我和奥黛丽。母亲撒了谎。">查看中文翻译</div>
