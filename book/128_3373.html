<div class="line_en">Mr. and Mrs. Antolini had this very swanky apartment over on Sutton Place, with two steps that you go down to get in the living room, and a bar and all. I'd been there quite a few times, because after I left Elkton Hills Mr. Antolini came up to our house for dinner quite frequently to find out how I was getting along. He wasn't married then. Then when he got married, I used to play tennis with he and Mrs. Antolini quite frequently, out at the West Side Tennis Club, in Forest Hills, Long Island. Mrs. Antolini belonged there. She was lousy with dough. She was about sixty years older than Mr. Antolini, but they seemed to get along quite well. For one thing, they were both very intellectual, especially Mr. Antolini, except that he was more witty than intellectual when you were with him, sort of like D. B. Mrs. Antolini was mostly serious. She had asthma pretty bad. They both read all D. B.'s stories -- Mrs. Antolini, too -- and when D. B. went to Hollywood, Mr. Antolini phoned him up and told him not to go. He went anyway, though. Mr. Antolini said that anybody that could write like D. B. had no business going out to Hollywood. That's exactly what I said, practically.</div>

But you could tell he was interested, so I told him a little bit about it. "It's this course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech. You know. Spontaneous and all.

<div class="line_en">"Oh, sure! I like somebody to stick to the point and all. But I don't like them to stick too much to the point. I don't know. I guess I don't like it when somebody sticks to the point all the time. The boys that got the best marks in Oral Expression were the ones that stuck to the point all the time -- I admit it. But there was this one boy, Richard Kinsella. He didn't stick to the point too much, and they were always yelling 'Digression!' at him. It was terrible, because in the first place, he was a very nervous guy -- I mean he was a very nervous guy -- and his lips were always shaking whenever it was his time to make a speech, and you could hardly hear him if you were sitting way in the back of the room. When his lips sort of quit shaking a little bit, though, I liked his speeches better than anybody else's. He practically flunked the course, though, too. He got a D plus because they kept yelling 'Digression!' at him all the time. For instance, he made this speech about this farm his father bought in Vermont. They kept yelling 'Digression!' at him the whole time he was making it, and this teacher, Mr. Vinson, gave him an F on it because he hadn't told what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm and all. What he did was, Richard Kinsella, he'd start telling you all about that stuff -- then all of a sudden he'd start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle, and how his uncle got polio and all when he was forty-two years old, and how he wouldn't let anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didn't want anybody to see him with a brace on. It didn't have much to do with the farm -- I admit it -- but it was nice. It's nice when somebody tells you about their uncle. Especially when they start out telling you about their father's farm and then all of a sudden get more interested in their uncle. I mean it's dirty to keep yelling 'Digression!' at him when he's all nice and excited… I don't know. It's hard to explain." I didn't feel too much like trying, either. For one thing, I had this terrific headache all of a sudden. I wished to God old Mrs. Antolini would come in with the coffee. That's something that annoys hell out of me -- I mean if somebody says the coffee's all ready and it isn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，当然啦！我当然喜欢他话不离题。可我不喜欢他太不离题。我不知道怎么说好。我揣摩我不喜欢人家始终话不离题。‘口头表达’里得分最高的全是那些始终话不离题的学生――这一点我承认。可是有个名叫理查。金斯拉的学生，演讲的时候若是离题，他们老冲着他喊‘离题啦！’这种做法实在可怕，因为第一，他是个神经非常容易紧张的家伙――我是说他的神经的确非常容易紧张一一每次轮到他讲话，他的嘴唇总是哆嗦着，而且你要是坐在课堂后排，连他讲的什么都听不清楚。可是等到他嘴唇哆嗦得不那么厉害的时候，我倒觉得他讲的比别人好。不过他差点儿也没及格。他得了个'D'，因为他们老冲着他喊‘离题啦！’举例说，有一次他演讲的题目是他父亲在弗蒙特买下的农庄。在他演讲的时候大家一个劲儿地冲着他喊‘离题啦！’教这门课的老师文孙先生那一次给了他一个F，因为他没有说出农庄上种的什么蔬菜，养的什么家畜。理查。金斯拉讲了些什么呢？他开始讲的是农庄――接着他突然讲起他妈妈收到他舅舅寄来的一封信，讲到他舅舅怎样在四十二岁患了脊髓炎，他怎样不愿别人到医院去看他，因为他不愿有人看见他身上绑着支架。这跟农庄没有多大关系――我承认――可是很有意思。只要有人跟你谈起自己的舅舅，这就很有意思，尤其是他开始谈的是他父亲的农庄，跟着突然对自己的舅舅更感兴趣。我是说要是他讲得很有意思，也很兴奋，那么再冲着他一个劲儿喊‘离题啦’，实在有点近于下流……我不知道怎么说好。实在很难解释。”事实上我也不太想解释。尤其是，我突然头痛得厉害。我真希望老安多里尼太太快透咖啡进来。这类事情最最让我恼火――我是说有人跟你说咖啡已经煮好，其实却没有煮好。">查看中文翻译</div>

But what I mean is, lots of time you don't know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesn't interest you most. I mean you can't help it sometimes. What I think is, you're supposed to leave somebody alone if he's at least being interesting and he's getting all excited about something. I like it when somebody gets excited about something. It's nice. You just didn't know this teacher, Mr. Vinson. He could drive you crazy sometimes, him and the goddam class. I mean he'd keep telling you to unify and simplify all the time. Some things you just can't do that to. I mean you can't hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody wants you to. You didn't know this guy, Mr. Vinson.

Once you get past all the Mr. Vinsons, you're going to start getting closer and closer -- that is, if you want to, and if you look for it and wait for it -- to the kind of information that will be very, very dear to your heart. Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them -- if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry." He stopped and took a big drink out of his highball. Then he started again. Boy, he was really hot. I was glad I didn't try to stop him or anything. "I'm not trying to tell you," he said, "that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world. It's not so. But I do say that educated and scholarly men, if they're brilliant and creative to begin with -- which, unfortunately, is rarely the case -- tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative. They tend to express themselves more clearly, and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end. And -- most important -- nine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker. Do you follow me at all?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nothing's the matter, it's just that all my money and stuff's in one of my bags. I'll be right back. I'll get a cab and be right back," I said. Boy, I was falling all over myself in the dark. "The thing is, it isn't mine, the money. It's my mother's, and I --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么，就是有一只手提箱放着我所有的钱什么的。我马上回来。我会叫辆出租汽车，马上回来，”我说。嘿，我在黑暗中跌跌撞撞地简直站不稳脚。“问题是，那钱不是我的。它是我母亲的，我――”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have to go where?" Mr. Antolini said. He was trying to act very goddam casual and cool and all, but he wasn't any too goddam cool. Take my word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你要上哪儿去？”安多里尼先生说。他想装出他妈的很随便、很冷静的样子，可他并不他妈的太冷静。相信我的话好了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, no kidding. I gotta get going. I really do." I was damn near all dressed already, except that I couldn't find my tie. I couldn't remember where I'd put my tie. I put on my jacket and all without it. Old Mr. Antolini was sitting now in the big chair a little ways away from me, watching me. It was dark and all and I couldn't see him so hot, but I knew he was watching me, all right. He was still boozing, too. I could see his trusty highball glass in his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我不是说着玩的。我非去不可。我真的非去不可。”我他妈的都已穿好衣服，只是找不着领带。我再也记不起把领带放在什么地方了。我就不打领带，穿好上装。老安多里尼先生这会儿正坐在离我不远的一把大椅子上，拿眼望着我。房里漆黑一团，我看不太清楚他的动作，可我照样知道他正拿眼望着我。而且他还在那儿喝酒呢。我都看得见他手里拿着那只盛有冰威士忌的酒杯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know it," I said. I didn't even look around much for my tie. So I went without it. "Good-by, sir," I said. "Thanks a lot. No kidding."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这我知道，”我说。我甚至没仔细寻找我的领带。所以我不打领带就走了。“再见吧，先生，”我说。“非常感谢您。一点不假。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't know what the hell to talk about while I was waiting for the elevator, and he kept standing there, so I said, "I'm gonna start reading some good books. I really am." I mean you had to say something. It was very embarrassing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在那儿等电梯，他也一直站着不动窝儿，我真不知道他妈的跟他说些什么好，所以我就说：“我要开始读几本好书了。真的。”我是说你总得讲些什么才好。那情况真是尴尬极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kept walking right behind me when I went to the front door, and when I rang the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway. All he said was that business about my being a "very, very strange boy" again. Strange, my ass. Then he waited in the doorway and all till the goddam elevator came. I never waited so long for an elevator in my whole goddam life. I swear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我往前门走去的时候，他一直跟在我后边；当我按电梯的铃的时候，他就站在那个混帐的门道里。他什么也没说，只是重复了一遍刚才的话，说我是个“十分、十分奇怪的孩子”。奇怪个屁！随后他就站在门道里等着，直等到混帐电梯上来。我这混帐一辈子里等电梯再也没等过这么久的，我能对天发誓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thanks a lot," I said. "G'by!" The elevator was finally there. I got in and went down. Boy, I was shaking like a madman. I was sweating, too. When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常感谢，”我说。“再见！”电梯终于上来了，我就进了电梯下楼。嘿，我象个疯子似的索索乱抖。我浑身还在冒汗。每次遇到这类性变态玩艺儿，我就会浑身冒汗。我从孩提时候起，这类的事遇到总有二十次了。我实在受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
