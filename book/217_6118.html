<div class="line_en">Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn't want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business – appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited – this kind of thing was right in his line.</div>

So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.</div>

Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn't want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections.

He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it – all but the cowhide part.</div>

Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drowned, and I wasn't ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out – big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pap warn't in a good humor – so he was his natural self. He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it And he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.</div>

He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me.

There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.

He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous.

There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek – but I couldn't see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering "Take him off! take him off! he's biting me on the neck!" I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道自己睡了多久，不过只听得一声尖声怪叫，我就爬了起来。只见爸爸神色狂野，满屋子跳过来跳过去，一边狂叫有蛇。他一声声说蛇爬上了腿，接着又跳又尖叫，又说一条蛇咬了腮帮子，——可是我没有看见什么蛇啊。他在木屋里跳过来，奔过去，一边高叫“捉住它，捉住它。蛇在咬我的颈子啦。”眼神如此狂乱的人，我可从来没有见过。一会儿，他也实在累垮了，倒下来喘得不行，接着又滚到东、滚到西，滚得猛快，又碰到什么就踢什么，双手在空中又是打又是抓，还尖声叫唤，说他给魔鬼抓住了。后来，他困得不行，躺了一会儿直呻吟。再后来，他躺得更加安静了，听不见声音了。但听得远处林子里猫头鹰和狼的响动声。一片阴森得吓人。他在屋角里躺着。慢慢地又半欠起身子，脑袋歪向一边，仔细听着。他声音很低地说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭以后，爸爸又拿起了酒瓶子，说瓶里的威士忌够他喝醉两回，外加一次酒疯。这是他的口头禅了。我估摸，大约一个钟头光景，他就会醉得人事不省，我便可以偷那把钥匙，或是把木头锯断，偷偷溜出去，两个办法总有一个能行得通。只见他喝啊，喝啊，一会儿就滚到了他那条毯子上。不过，这回儿我运气不佳。他并没有睡熟，而是睡得不安生。他不停地呻唤，好长时间不停气地翻身，翻到东来翻到西。后来，我实在困得不行，连眼睛也睁不开来，不知不觉之间，便熟睡过去了，连蜡烛还点着哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could hear him through the blanket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但见他双手双脚伏在地下，一边爬开，一边哀求他们放开他。他用毯子把全身裹了起来，滚到了旧的橡木桌子下面，一边还是苦苦哀求，接着又哭了起来。我还能听到那透过毯子传出的哭声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a claspknife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再后来，他滚了出来，站起身来，猛然一跳，神色狂乱。他看到了我，朝我追来。他一圈又一圈地追我，手里拿着一把折刀，一声声叫我是死亡天使，说要杀我，好叫我从此不能再来索他的命。我求告于他，对他说，我只是赫克啊。不过，他如此这般地惨笑了一下，又吼了起来，咒骂了起来，又使劲追我。有一回，我突然一转身，想从他胳膊下面钻过去，可给他一把抓住，抓住了肩膀上的茄克。我想，这下子我可完了。可是我象闪电一般把茄克一下子褪了下来，总算保了一命。没有多久，他也累垮了，一边倒下，背靠着大门，一边还说，且让他歇一口气，再来杀我。他把刀子放在他身下。一边说，他要睡一下，把精神恢复起来，然后他倒要看一看究竟谁是谁。">查看中文翻译</div>
