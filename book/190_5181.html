<div class="line_en">The next day Oliver travelled with Mr Brown low, Dr Losberne, Mrs May lie and Rose back to his birthplace. He had been told a little of his history, and knew that there would be more explanations at the end of this journey. He was anxious and uncertain, wondering what he would hear.</div>

<div class="line_en">They stopped at the biggest hotel in the town, and went in to their rooms. During dinner Mr Brown low stayed in a separate room, and the older members of the group went in and out with serious faces. Mrs May lie came back with her eyes red from crying. All this made Rose and Oliver, who had not been told any new secrets, very nervous and uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在镇上最大的一座旅馆前停了下来，进了各自的房间。晚餐时，布朗洛先生待在一个单独的房间里，其他年长的人进出这房间时都板着严肃的面孔。梅利夫人出来时两眼哭得通红。罗斯和奥利弗对这一切感到非常紧张和不安，因为他们未曾被告知任何新的秘密情况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But towards the end of the journey, he began to recognize familiar places, and in great excitement pointed them out to Rose. There was the path he had taken when he had run away. There, across the fields, was the "baby farm". The n, as They drove into the town, he saw the house of Mr Sowerberry the undertaker, and the workhouse that had been his prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路快走完了，他逐渐地认出了那些熟悉的地方，十分激动地把这些地方指给罗斯看。那儿是他当初逃离时走过的小道。田野的另一端是育婴堂。他们驾车进镇子时，他看到了棺材店老板索尔贝里先生的房子，以及他曾在其中过着囚徒生活的济贫院。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At nine o'clock Dr Losberne and Mr Brown low brought Monks into the room. Oliver was very surprised; this was the same man he had bumped into once outside a pub, and seen another time with Fagin, looking in at him through the window of the country cottage. Oliver was told that Monks was his half-brother, and the boy stared at him in shock and amazement. Monks looked back at him with hatred.</div>

He talked of the misery of his marriage to his wife, and the evil character of you, Monks, his only son, who had been brought up by your mother to hate him. He left you and your mother an annual income of $800. The rest of his property he left to his girl Agnes and to their child, if it were born alive, and if it showed itself to be of a good, kind character. The money would only go to you, Monks, as the older son, if The younger turned out to be as evil as you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那份遗嘱，”布朗洛先生接着说，“和信中所说的意思是一样的。他在里面讲到了他同他妻子的痛苦婚姻以及他唯一的儿子蒙克斯——也就是你——的邪恶性格，你母亲抚养你成人时一直教你憎恨你父亲。他留给你和你的母亲每年800英镑的收入。其余的财产都留给了那个少女阿格尼丝以及他们的孩子，如果这个孩子能活下来，并且成长为一个善良的好孩子的话。如果这个孩子变得像你一样邪恶，那么你蒙克斯作为长子，有权拥有所有这些钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My mother," said Monks, "burnt this will, and never sent the letter. The girl Agnes left her home in secret, so that her pregnancy would not bring shame on her family. I swore to my mother, when she was dying, that if I ever found my half-brother, I would do him all the harm I could. He would feel my hatred like a whip on his back. I paid Fagin to trap Oliver into a life of crime. But then he escaped, and that stupid, interfering girl Nancy talked to you. If I'd had the chance, I would have finished what I'd begun." Monks stared at Oliver, and his lips moved in a silent curse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒙克斯说：“我母亲烧了这份遗嘱，也没有把信发出去。那个少女阿格尼丝偷偷地离开了家，因为她不愿让怀孕这件事使她的家庭蒙上耻辱。我母亲死时，我向她发誓，如果我遇上我那异母兄弟的话，我会竭尽全力地伤害他的。他会感到我的憎恨就像鞭子抽打在他的背上。我付给费金钱，是让他设圈套给奥利弗钻，使他过上犯罪的生活。但他逃脱了，而那个愚蠢的好管闲事的南希把一切都告诉了你们。如果我机缘好的话，我本来是能够完成已经开始做的事的。”蒙克斯盯着奥利弗，嘴唇蠕动，不出声地暗暗诅咒着。">查看中文翻译</div>

He died very soon afterwards, and this young daughter was taken in by some poor people. My mother hated Agnes and everybody connected with her. She hunted for this young sister, and made sure that her life would be unhappy. She told the poor people who had taken her in that the girl was illegitimate, and that she came from a bad family with an evil reputation. So the child led a life of miserable poverty -- until Mrs May lie saw her by chance, pitied her, and took her home."</div>

Not one of the faces showed any sympathy towards him; all were determined that he should hang. At last, there was a cry of "Silence!", and everyone looked towards the door. The jury returned, and passed close to Fagin. He could tell nothing from their faces; They could have been made of stone. Then there was complete stillness -- not a whisper, not a breath… "Guilty!" The whole court rang with a great shout, echoing through all the rooms as the crowd ran out of the building to tell all the people waiting outside. The news was that he would die on Monday.</div>
