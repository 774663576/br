<div class="line_en">She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook's tears and made it flow. Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were on the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his success?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胡克在甲板上踱来踱去，沉思着。这个深奥莫测的人呐，这是他大获全胜的时刻。彼得已经被除掉了，再也不能挡他的道；别的孩子全都被捉到了船上，等着走跳板。自从他制伏了巴比克以来，这要算他最辉煌的一次战绩了。我们知道，人性是多么虚荣，如果他现在在甲板上大摇大摆地踱着方步，由于胜利而趾高气扬，那也不足为怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma (putrid mist) of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook's reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled (attacked) her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school's distinguished slouch.

Left so fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on he knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.</div>
