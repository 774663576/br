<div class="line_en">Jacob was clinging precariously to the top of the spruce that grew in the middle of Charlie's little front yard. His weight had bowed the tree toward the house and he now swung -- his legs dangling twenty feet above the ground -- not a yard away from me. The thin branches at the tip of the tree scraped against the side of the house again with a grating squeal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布趴在前院栽种的云杉上，树枝被他压得倒向房子这边，他在树顶上来回摆荡——她的双腿悬在离地二十多英尺的半空中——离我不过三英尺。纤细的树枝摩擦着房子的墙壁，发出刺耳的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another scream built in my throat as I waited for him to fall to his death -- or at least maim himself against the wooden siding. To my shock, he swung agilely into my room, landing on the balls of his feet with a low thud.</div>

<div class="line_en">A wide grin spread slowly across Jacob's face; he seemed extremely pleased with himself. It wasn't the grin that I knew and loved -- it was a new grin, one that was a bitter mockery of his old sincerity, on the new face that belonged to Sam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布咧嘴一笑，他似乎十分满意自己的身手。他的笑容不是我所熟悉和喜爱的——这是一张不同的笑脸，在这张属于山姆的脸上已经看不到以往的真诚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was a bit much for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我受够了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd cried myself to sleep over this boy. His harsh rejection had punched a painful new hole in what was left of my chest. He'd left a new nightmare behind him, like an infection in a sore -- the insult after the injury. And now he was here in my room, smirking at me as if none of that had passed. Worse than that, even though his arrival had been noisy and awkward, it reminded me of when Edward used to sneak in through my window at night, and the reminder picked viciously at the unhealed wounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我整晚以泪洗面，因为这个男孩儿而辗转难眠。他冷酷地拒绝了我，在我的旧伤口上无情地撒了把盐。他留给我的噩梦挥散不去。就像是伤口引发的感染——就像遭人侵犯后赶到的羞辱。而现在，他在我的房间看着我傻笑似乎什么事情都没有发生过一样。更糟糕的是，尽管他闯入是的动静很大，动作笨拙，还是让我想起了爱德华，他也曾在深夜时分穿过窗户来到我的房间。回忆又一次狠狠地刺痛了我尚未痊愈的伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All of this, coupled with the fact that I was dog-tired, did not put me in a friendly mood. "Get out!" I hissed, putting as much venom into the whisper as I could.</div>

<div class="line_en">I tried to shove him back out the window -- after all, if this was a dream, it wouldn't really hurt him. It was useless, though. I didn't budge him an inch. I dropped my hands quickly, and stepped away from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拼命把他往窗户外推——反正这是梦境，他不会真正受伤，但是，我的努力是徒劳的，他仍然一动不动地站在原地。我放下双手，退到远离他的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wasn't wearing a shirt, though the air blowing in the window was cold enough to make me shiver, and it made me uncomfortable to have my hands on his bare chest. His skin was burning hot, like his head had been the last time I'd touched him. Like he was still sick with the fever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吹进房间的凉风让我打了个冷战，而他连衬衫都没穿。我的手碰到他的胸膛时的感觉很不舒服，他的皮肤像在燃烧一样发烫，就跟我最后一次触摸他前额时的感觉相同，难道他还没退烧？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He blinked, his face going blank with surprise. "No," he protested. "I came to apologize."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他眨了眨眼睛，露出吃惊的表情。“不，他坚持道，”我是来道歉的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't look sick. He looked huge. He leaned over me, so big that he blacked out the window, tongue-tied by my furious reaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看上去不像生病的样子，身体壮实得很。他朝我弯下身子，几乎挡住了整扇窗户，对我暴怒的反应他一言不发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, it was just more than I could handle -- it felt as if all of my sleepless nights were crashing down on me en masse. I was so brutally tired that I thought I might collapse right there on the floor. I swayed unsteadily, and struggled to keep my eyes open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，我再也撑不住了——好像所有不眠之夜的疲乏都在这一刻朝我袭来。我觉得天昏地暗，整个人就快要崩溃倒地。我左右摇摆了两下，挣扎地睁开了双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bella?" Jacob whispered anxiously. He caught my elbow as I swayed again, and steered me back to the bed. My legs gave out when I reached the edge, and I plopped into a limp heap on the mattress.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他倔强的脸上露出一丝痛苦。“对，”他赞同道，然后深吸一口气，“我问了句废话。好吧我——我对不起你，贝拉。”他的道歉是真心的，这点毫无疑问，尽管他的脸上仍带着些许怒色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked at me with knowing eyes, and my thoughts jumped immediately to the Cullens. I hoped my expression didn't look guilty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看着我，眼神中带着某种暗示，我一下子就想到了卡伦一家，但愿他没有察觉到我的心虚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, I couldn't argue with that. He was exactly right -- I had a secret that wasn't mine to tell, yet a secret I felt bound to protect. A secret that, suddenly, he seemed to know all about.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from -- the Quileutes, I mean?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我们的任何的传说吗，关于我们是从哪里来的——奎鲁特人，我的意思是？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remembered it all now -- every word that Jacob had said to me that day on the beach, even the part before he got to the vampires, the "cold ones." Especially that first part.</div>

<div class="line_en">I almost expected Charlie to come check on me this time. This wasn't my usual screaming. I buried my head in my pillow and tried to muffle the hysterics that my screams were building into. J pressed the cotton tight against my face, wondering if I couldn't also somehow smother the connection I'd just made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一回我倒希望查理进来看看。我的叫声与平常不同，我把头埋在枕头下，想压抑住尖叫触发的歇斯底里。我用枕头紧紧地压住脸，似乎这样就能消除我刚刚恍然明白的事实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not really," I admitted.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood -- supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive, like Noah and the ark." He smiled then, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. "Another legend claims that we descended from wolves -- and that the wolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，有很多传说，其中一些可以追溯到大洪水时期，据说，古代的奎鲁特族人把他们的独木舟绑在最高的树顶山上生存，就像诺亚和方舟。”他笑了笑，然后向我展示他并不太相信这些历史。“另一个传说声称我们是从狼而来的，狼是我们的兄弟。杀害他们是违反部落法律的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。有一个冷血家族传说跟狼人传说一样古来，还有一些更为现代的传说。据传说，我自己的曾祖父知道其中一些。“他是制定条约的人，使他们远离我们的领地。”雅各伯翻了转眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
