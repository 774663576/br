<div class="line_en">Ah! yes, that was little Tuk: in reality his name was not Tuk, but that was what he called himself before he could speak plain: he meant it for Charles, and it is all well enough if one does but know it. He had now to take care ofhis little sister Augusta, who was much younger than himself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time; but these two things would not do together at all. There sat the poor little fellow, with his sister on his lap, and he sang to her all the songs he knew; and he glanced the while from time to time into the geography-book that lay open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt all the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is possible to be known.</div>

<div class="line_en">His mother now came home, for she had been out, and took little Augusta on her arm. Tuk ran quickly to the window, and read so eagerly that he pretty nearly read his eyes out; for it got darker and darker, but his mother had no money to buy a candle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他的妈妈回来了，因为她到外面去过。她把小小的古斯塔乌抱起来。杜克跑到窗子那儿，拼命看书，几乎把眼睛都看花了，因为天已经慢慢黑下来了；但是他的妈妈没有钱买蜡烛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There goes the old washerwoman over the way," said his mother, as she looked out of the window. "The poor woman can hardly drag herself along, and she must now drag the pail home from the fountain. Be a good boy, Tukey, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个洗衣的老太婆在街上走来了，”正在朝窗子外面望的妈妈说。“她连走路也走不动，但还是要从井里取一桶水上来。做个好孩子吧，杜克，快过去帮助这个老太太一下！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Tuk ran over quickly and helped her; but when he came back again into the room it was quite dark, and as to a light, there was no thought of such a thing. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead; in it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and of all that his master had told him. He ought, to be sure, to have read over his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He therefore put his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson; but one cannot, however, rely upon it entirely. Well, there he lay, and thought and thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes and mouth: he slept, and yet he did not sleep; it was as though the old washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, "It were a great sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning. You have aided me, I therefore will now help you; and the loving God will do so at all times." And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping and scratching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杜克立刻就跑过去帮她的忙。不过当他回到房里来的时候，天已经很黑了。蜡烛他们是买不起的；他只得上床去睡，而他的床却是一张旧板凳。他躺在那上面，想着他的地理功课：西兰的主教区和老师所讲的一切东西。他的确应该先温习好，但是他现在没有法子做到。所以只好把地理课本放在枕头底下，因为他听说这可以帮助人记住课文，不过这个办法却不一定靠得住。 他躺在那上面，想了许多事情。忽然觉得有人吻他的眼睛和嘴。他似乎睡着了，又似乎没有睡着。他好像觉得那个洗衣老太婆的温柔的眼睛在看他，并且对他说：“如果你明天记不住功课，那真是可惜得很！你帮助过我，我现在应该帮助你。我们的上帝总是帮助人的！” 杜克的那本书马上就在他的头底下窸窸窣窣地动起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

"I am a Kjoger hen,"said she, and then she related how many inhabitants there were there, and about the battle that had taken place, and which, after all, was hardly worth talking about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“吉克——哩基！咕！咕！”这原来是一只老母鸡跑出来了——而且它是一只却格①的鸡。“我是一只却格的母鸡，”它说。 于是它就告诉他，那个小镇有多少居民，那儿曾经打过一次仗——虽然这的确不值得一提。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on horseback. On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A knight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him before him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the old town of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town. High towers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of many candles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song, and King Waldemar and the young, richly-attired maids of honor danced together. The morn now came; and as soon as the sun appeared, the whole town and the king's palace crumbled together, and one tower after the other; and at last only a single one remained standing where the castle had been before,* and the town was so small and poor, and the school boys came along with their books under their arms, and said, "2000 inhabitants!" but that was not true, for there were not so many.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过现在小杜克已经不是躺在床上，他忽然骑上了一匹马。跑！跑！跳！跳！马儿在驰骋着。一位穿得很漂亮的骑士，戴着发亮的头盔和修长的羽毛，把他抱在马鞍前面坐着。他们穿过森林，来到古老的城市伏尔丁堡——这是一个非常热闹的大城市。国王的宫殿上耸立着许多高塔；塔上的窗子里射出亮光，那里面有歌声和跳舞。国王瓦尔得马尔和许多漂亮的宫女们在一直跳着舞。这时天已经亮了。当太阳出来的时候，整个城市和国王的宫殿就沉下去了，那些高塔也一个接着一个地不见了。最后只有一座塔立在原来宫殿所在地的山上。这个城市显得渺小和寒碜。小学生把书本夹在臂下走来了，说：“两千个居民。”不过这不是真的，因为事实上并没有这么多人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Many remembrances from Corsor. That is a town that is just rising into importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches: formerly people called it ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on the sea," said Corsor; "I have high roads and gardens, and I have given birth to a poet who was witty and amusing, which all poets are not. I once intended to equip a ship that was to sail all round the earth; but I did not do it, although I could have done so: and then, too, I smell so deliciously, for close before the gate bloom the most beautiful roses."</div>

<div class="line_en">Little Tuk looked, and all was red and green before his eyes; but as soon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over, all of a sudden there appeared a wooded slope close to the bay, and high up above stood a magnificent old church, with two high pointed towers. From out the hill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water, so that there was a continual splashing; and close beside them sat an old king with a golden crown upon his white head: that was King Hroar, near the fountains, close to the town of Roeskilde, as it is now called. And up the slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of Denmark, hand in hand, all with their golden crowns; and the organ played and the fountains rustled. Little Tuk saw all, heard all. "Do not forget the diet," said King Hroar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小杜克看着它；它在他眼中是红色的和绿色的。当这种种的色彩渐渐消逝了以后，附近清亮的海湾上就出现了一个长满树林的斜坡。上面有一座美丽的老教堂，它顶上有两个高高的尖塔。一股涌泉从山里流出来，发出潺潺的声音。一位年老的国王坐在近旁，他的长头发上戴着一顶金王冠。这就是“泉水旁的赫洛尔王”——也就是人们现在所谓的罗斯吉尔得镇①。丹麦所有的国王和王后，头上戴着金冠，都手挽着手，走到这座山上的那个古教堂里来。于是琴楼上的风琴奏起来了，泉水也发出潺潺的鸣声。杜克看到这些景象，也听到这些声音。“请不要忘记这王国的各个省份！”国王赫洛尔说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Again all suddenly disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to him just as if one turned over a leaf in a book. And now stood there an old peasant-woman, who came from Soroe,* where grass grows in the market-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and back: it was so wet, it certainly must have been raining. "Yes, that it has," said she; and she now related many pretty things out of Holberg's comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalon; but all at once she cowered together, and her head began shaking backwards and forwards, and she looked as she were going to make a spring. "Croak! croak!" said she. "It is wet, it is wet; there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in Sorbe!" She was now suddenly a frog, "Croak"; and now she was an old woman. "One must dress according to the weather," said she. "It is wet; it is wet. My town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck, and by the neck one must get out again! In former times I had the finest fish, and now I have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the bottle, who learn wisdom, Hebrew, Greek-Croak!"</div>
