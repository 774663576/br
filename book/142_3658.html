<div class="line_en">He reached out and felt Connie's soft spreading buttocks. She smiled at him and he said contemptuously, "You got more ham than a hog." It pleased him to see the hurt look on her face, the tears springing into her eyes. She might be a daughter of the Great Don but she was his wife, she was his property now and he could treat her as he pleased. It made him feel powerful that one of the Corleones was his doormat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carlo Rizzi was punk sore at the world. Once married into the Corleone Family, he'd been shunted aside with a small bookmaker's business on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He'd counted on one of the houses in the mall on Long Beach, he knew the Don could move retainer families out when he pleased and he had been sure it would happen and he would be on the inside of everything. But the Don wasn't treating him right. The "Great Don," he thought with scorn. An old Moustache Pete who'd been caught out on the street by gunmen like any dumb small-time hood. He hoped the old bastard croaked. Sonny had been his friend once and if Sonny became the head of the Family maybe he'd get a break, get on the inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could feel Connie watching his back and so he flexed his muscles as he reached for the plate of sweet buns on the other side of the table. He'd just polished off ham and eggs but he was a big man and needed a big breakfast. He was pleased with the picture he knew he presented to his wife. Not the usual greasy dark guinzo husband but crew-cut blond, huge golden-haired forearms and broad shoulders and thin waist. And he knew he was physically stronger than any of those so-called hard guys that worked for the family. Guys like Clemenza, Tessio, Rocco Lampone, and that guy Paulie that somebody had knocked off. He wondered what the story was about that. Then for some reason he thought about Sonny. Man to man he could take Sonny, he thought, even though Sonny was a little bigger and a little heavier. But what scared him was Sonny's rep, though he himself had never seen Sonny anything but good-natured and kidding around. Yeah, Sonny was his buddy. Maybe with the old Don gone, things would open up.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had started her off just right. She had tried to keep that purse full of money presents for herself and he had given her a nice black eye and taken the money from her. Never told her what he'd done with it, either. That might have really caused some trouble. Even now he felt just the slightest twinge of remorse. Christ, he'd blown nearly fifteen grand on the track and show girl bimbos.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first time he had marked her up, he'd been a little worried. She had gone right out to Long Beach to complain to her mother and father and to show her black eye. He had really sweated it out. But when she came back she had been surprisingly meek, the dutiful little Italian wife. He had made it a point to be the perfect husband over the next few weeks, treating her well in every way, being lovey and nice with her, banging her every day, morning and night. Finally she had told him what had happened since she thought he would never act that way again.</div>

<div class="line_en">He left the apartment and found a parking ticket on his car, a fifteen-dollar green one. He put it in the glove compartment with the stack of others. He was in a good humor.

<div class="line_cn" title="他离开公寓，找了一张他的汽车停车票，一张十五美元的绿色停车票。他把这张停车票同一沓别的停车票都放进汽车仪表板后面的小贮藏箱里。他的情绪很好，在那个娇生惯养的小母狗脸上打耳光，叫她服帖，每次都使他感到很痛快，这就把他因在考利昂家族中所受到的极坏的待遇而淤积的闷气消除了一点点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Learning all this, Carlo Rizzi grew confident. He was perfectly safe. In fact he bragged to his two "writers" on the book, Sally Rags and Coach, about how he bounced his wife around when she got snotty and saw their looks of respect that he had the guts to manhandle the daughter of the great Don Corleone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗·瑞泽知道了这一切后，大大地放心了，一点儿顾忌也没有了，竟然向他的两个赌注登记员萨里·拉各斯和寇奇吹嘘说，一旦老婆不顺眼，他就如何脚踢拳打。他同时发现他们流露出了敬意，敬佩他居然有胆量在伟大的考利昂老头子面前逞强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the Don had not been so unsympathetic as he pretended. He made inquiries and found out what Carlo Rizzi had done with the wedding present money. He had men assigned to Carlo Rizzi's bookmaking operation who would report to Hagen everything Rizzi did on the job. But the Don could not interfere. How expect a man to discharge his husbandly duties to a wife whose family he feared? It was an impossible situation and he dared not meddle. Then when Connie became pregnant he was convinced of the wisdom of his decision and felt he never could interfere though Connie complained to her mother about a few more beatings and the mother finally became concerned enough to mention it to the Don. Connie even hinted that she might want a divorce. For the first time in her life the Don was angry with her. "He is the father of your child. What can a child come to in this world if he has no father?" he said to Connie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，老头子并不像他表面上所装出来的那样冷漠、他问了一下，也发现了卡罗·瑞泽把钱抢去干了些什么。他早就安插了一些人监视卡罗·瑞泽的赌注登记工作，这些人把卡罗·瑞泽所干的一切，都一五一十地向黑根汇报。但老头子也无法插手，一个男人如果怕老婆的娘家，怎么能指望他去履行他作丈夫的职责呢？这是个无法解决的僵局，他不敢插手。当康妮怀孕之后，他确信他的决定是明智的。虽然康妮向她母亲诉苦说她又挨了几次打，虽然当母亲的终于又动了心，并向老头子旧事重提，但老头子还是觉得无法插手。康妮甚至拐弯抹角地表示：她可能要提出离婚。她第一次遇到老头子对她发起脾气来了。“他是你孩子的爸爸，一个孩子如果没有爸爸，他在这个世界上靠谁呢？”他对康妮说。">查看中文翻译</div>

The other men traveled in their own cars and had apartments on either side of Lucy's apartment. It was safe to visit her as long as he didn't do it too often.

Standing up, he could see the kids look at him with the staring, sickened faces of people who had witnessed the degradation of a fellow human being. He was a little dizzy but if was more from shock, the raw fear that had taken command of his body; he was not badly hurt despite the shower of heavy blows. He let Coach lead him by the arm into the back room of the candy store and put ice on his face, which, though it was not cut or bleeding, was lumpy with swelling bruises. The fear was subsiding now and the humiliation he had suffered made him sick to his stomach so that he had to throw up. Coach held his head over the sink, supported him as if he were drunk, then helped him upstairs to the apartment and made him lie down in one of the bedrooms.
