<div class="line_en">And always, before, it had been fine. Not much different from holding Josh's hand when they were little kids crossing the street. Or holding his grandma's hand when she took him to church. Maybe a little sweatier, a little more awkward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些握手的感觉，毫无例外，就是“还行”，跟小时候牵乔许的手过街，或者牵着奶奶的手去教堂感觉没什么两样。可能手汗多一些，也尴尬些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he'd kissed that girl last year, with his mouth dry and his eyes mostly open, Park had wondered if maybe there was something wrong with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去年他亲吻那女孩时嘴唇发干，眼睛基本全程睁开，帕克觉得自己大概有毛病。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park had held hands with girls before. Girls at Skateland. A girl at the ninth-grade dance last year. (They'd kissed while they waited for her dad to pick them up.) He'd even held Tina's hand, back when they "went" together in the sixth grade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克以前就握过女生的手。溜冰场的那些女孩，还有去年初三舞会里的一个女孩。（在等她爸爸来接时，他们还接吻了。）六年级时，他跟提娜在“交往”，也握过她的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He'd even wondered -- seriously, while he was kissing her, he'd wondered this -- whether he might be gay. Except he didn't feel like kissing any guys either. And if he thought about She-Hulk or Storm (instead of this girl, Dawn) the kissing got a lot better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吻那女孩时，他怀疑（真的很怀疑）自己是不是同性恋，不过他也没想过要吻哪个男生。当他想象女浩克或者暴风女，而不是他正在吻的女孩彤恩，那个吻就好一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe I'm not attracted to real girls, he'd thought at the time. Maybe I'm some sort of perverted cartoon-sexual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时他想，自己要么是不被真实的女孩吸引，要么就是动画片里的那种变态色鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>
