<div class="line_en">The real Patsy Ann was a Staffordshire bull terrier who arrived in Juneau as a newborn pup in late 1929 with her human family. Her family didn't keep her once they realized she was deaf and could not bark.</div>

<div class="line_en">All those who travel to Juneau, Alaska, by water are welcomed at the dock by a dog named Patsy Ann. She doesn't bark. She doesn't wag her tail. She doesn't even respond when you call her. That's because Patsy Ann is a bronze statue that sits imposingly and silently in the middle of Patsy Ann Square, which borders Juneau's Gastineau Channel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凡是经海路去阿拉斯加州朱诺市的人，都会在码头上受到一只叫帕齐·安的狗的欢迎。它不吠叫，也不摇尾巴。你若是招呼它，它也不回应你。这是因为帕齐·安是一个青铜像，庄重而安详地坐落在同名广场的中心，与加斯蒂诺海峡毗邻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dog was taken in by a second family, but for unknown reasons was later abandoned by them as well. Patsy then became an orphan who freely roamed the streets of Juneau. Patsy Ann limited her daily wanderings to the downtown area, where local merchants and residents grinned at the sight of her happily loping from business to business. Though Patsy Ann was an orphan, the Longshoremen's Hall became her nightly home. For her, it was the most logical place for warmth and sleep because she spent so much of her time on the docks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只狗被第二个家庭收留了，可不知为什么，后来又被抛弃了。帕齐成了朱诺街头自由游荡的孤儿。它白天只在市中心迷茫地游荡，而当地的商人和居民一看到它高高兴兴地从一家店铺跑到另一家，就满脸笑容。尽管它是条孤狗，但每天晚上码头工人大厅就成了它的家。在它看来，这当然是避寒和夜宿的地方，因为它的时间几乎都花在码头上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, townspeople gathered at the appointed dock to await an incoming ship. Patsy Ann joined the expectant crowd and then suddenly ran to a different dock. Everyone was perplexed by her behavior until they realized they had been given misinformation. The ship entered the channel and berthed at the very dock where the terrier was waiting!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，人们聚集在指定码头迎接到岸的船。帕齐·安也加入了迎船的人群中，突然间，它跑到另外一个码头上去了。每个人都对它的举动感到困惑，后来才意识到是他们弄错了。这艘船开进海峡，就停靠在帕齐等的那个泊位上！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The deaf dog possessed a most remarkable ability. Whenever a ship neared Gastineau Channel, Patsy Ann was somehow able to "hear" its whistle, even if the ship was as much as a half-mile away. At once, the terrier would scamper down to the wharf to await the ship's arrival.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这聋哑狗有一种非常突出的能力。只要有船一接近加斯蒂诺海峡，不知为什么，即使船还在半英里外，帕齐·安都能“听见”汽笛声。这时，它就会跑到码头等待着船靠岸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Juneau's residents had no idea how Patsy Ann was able to sense the imminent approach of a ship, anymore than they could figure out how the dog knew at exactly which dock she should wait. But they learned to trust her unerring judgment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朱诺的居民不清楚帕齐·安怎么会有预感船即将到岸的能力，更不明白它是如何知道船确切的停靠码头，然后去那里等待。但是他们认识到要相信这条狗的准确判断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Patsy Ann may have loved the local people who fed her and fondly patted her. She may have felt cared for by the longshoremen. But Patsy Ann's primary happiness came from sitting on the docks as she waited to welcome the ships.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕齐·安也许很喜欢当地居民，他们给它喂吃的，钟爱地轻轻拍它。它也经常受到码头工人的照顾，但是帕齐的主要乐趣就是坐在码头上，等待着靠岸的船只。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was appropriate, then, in 1934, for Juneau's mayor to proclaim Patsy Ann "the official greeter of Juneau, Alaska".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，理所当然地，1934年，朱诺市市长宣布帕齐·安为“阿拉斯加朱诺市官方迎宾小姐”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The same year, the city passed an ordinance stating that all dogs must be licensed. After an animal-control worker impounded Patsy Ann and threatened to euthanize the stray, several of the locals chipped in to pay for her license and to buy a bright red collar for her. She was again free to continue her lookout duty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同年，该市通过一项法令，规定所有的狗必须要领执照。一名动物管理员扣留了帕齐，并威胁说要给它执行安乐死。很多市民凑钱为它办了执照，还买了个鲜红的狗圈。帕齐重获自由，又有更多的时间继续执行遥望的任务。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For thirteen years, nearly all the days of her life, the wagging tail and the happy-go-lucky presence of the little dog brought a pleasant constancy to the lives of Juneau residents. She could not hear them say "good girl", but she saw their smiles and felt their affection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="13年来，几乎在它生命的每一天，每当它摇着尾巴无忧无虑地出现时，总给朱诺的居民带来了欢乐。它听不见他们说“好姑娘”，但是看得见他们的微笑，感受得到他们的关爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, in 1942, Patsy Ann died of natural causes. Members of the saddened community placed Patsy Ann's body in a small wooden casket and lowered it into Gastineau Channel. Now she would forever be tied to the hearts of Juneau's people and to the tranquil waters she loved to watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1942年，帕齐自然老死。悲痛的市民把帕齐·安的尸体安放在一个小木棺材里，慢慢落在加斯蒂诺海峡中。现在，它将和朱诺市市民的心永远连在一起，和它喜欢遥望的宁静的水域永远连在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nearly fifty years after Patsy Ann's death, a campaign was waged to memorialize the terrier. A small patch of land at the Gatineau wharfside was converted into what is now Patsy Ann Square, and a larger-than-life bronze statue was commissioned -- complete with a bronze collar that rests at its base.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕齐·安死后约半个世纪，一场纪念它的活动开展了。加斯蒂诺码头边的一小块土地改建成今日的帕齐·安广场，并在那儿竖立起一尊耀眼的青铜像，比帕齐·安本身还要大，基座上还有一个铜领圈。">查看中文翻译</div>
