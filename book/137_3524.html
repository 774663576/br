<div class="line_en">Now, in 1482, Quasimodo had grown up. He had become a few years previously the bellringer of Notre-Dame, thanks to his father by adoption, Claude Frollo, -- who had become archdeacon of Josas, thanks to his suzerain, Messire Louis de Beaumont, -- who had become Bishop of Paris, at the death of Guillaume Chartier in 1472, thanks to his patron, Olivier Le Daim, barber to Louis XI., king by the grace of God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="却说，一四八二年的卡席莫多已经长大成人，经养父克洛德·弗罗洛的保举，当圣母院的敲钟人已经有年。而弗罗洛也经恩主路易·德·博蒙的保举，当上了若萨的副主教；博蒙则于一四七二年在吉约墨·夏提埃去世之后，经恩主奥利维埃·公鹿（由于上帝恩佑，他是路易十一的御前理发师）的保举，继任为巴黎主教。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly intimate bond which united the ringer to the church. Separated forever from the world, by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his natural deformity, imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double circle, the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world beyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow. Notre-Dame had been to him successively, as he grew up and developed, the egg, the nest, the house, the country, the universe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岁月流逝，这个打钟人同主教堂结成了难以形容的难解难分的缘分。来历不明，兼以形体丑陋，这样的双重厄运使他永远与世隔绝，可怜的不幸人自幼就囚禁在这双重不可逾越的桎梏之中，已经习惯于对收养他而加以庇佑的宗教墙垣以外的世界一无所见。随着他成长发育，圣母院对于他，已经相继成为卵、巢、家、祖国、宇宙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church. When, still a little fellow, he had dragged himself tortuously and by jerks beneath the shadows of its vaults, he seemed, with his human face and his bestial limbs, the natural reptile of that humid and sombre pavement, upon which the shadow of the Romanesque capitals cast so many strange forms.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is thus that, little by little, developing always in sympathy with the cathedral, living there, sleeping there, hardly ever leaving it, subject every hour to the mysterious impress, he came to resemble it, he incrusted himself in it, so to speak, and became an integral part of it. His salient angles fitted into the retreating angles of the cathedral (if we may be allowed this figure of speech), and he seemed not only its inhabitant but more than that, its natural tenant. One might almost say that he had assumed its form, as the snail takes on the form of its shell. It was his dwelling, his hole, his envelope. There existed between him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy, so many magnetic affinities, so many material affinities, that he adhered to it somewhat as a tortoise adheres to its shell. The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，始终顺应主教堂的模式而渐渐发育成长，在主教堂里生活、睡觉，几乎足不出户，随时承受着它那神秘的压力，他终于酷似主教堂了，镶嵌在它里面，可以说已经成为它的一个组成部分了。他那躯体突出的一个个棱角——请允许我这样修辞——正好嵌合在这座建筑物凹进去的一个个角落里。他似乎不仅仅是它的住客，而且是它的天然内涵。差不多可以说，他以它为形状，正如蜗牛以其壳为形状。它是他的寓所、洞穴、躯壳。古老教堂和他之间本能上的息息相通，是那样深沉，有那么多的磁性亲和力、物质亲和力，使得他紧紧粘附于它，在某种程度上犹如乌龟之粘附于龟壳。凸凹不平的主教堂就是他的甲壳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later on, the first time that he caught hold, mechanically, of the ropes to the towers, and hung suspended from them, and set the bell to clanging, it produced upon his adopted father, Claude, the effect of a child whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the similes which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular, symmetrical, direct, almost consubstantial union of a man and an edifice. It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that whole cathedral was familiar to him, after so long and so intimate a cohabitation. That dwelling was peculiar to him. It had no depths to which Quasimodo had not penetrated, no height which he had not scaled. He often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven points of the carving. The towers, on whose exterior surface he was frequently seen clambering, like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular wall, those two gigantic twins, so lofty, so menacing, so formidable, possessed for him neither vertigo, nor terror, nor shocks of amazement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无需提醒读者，请诸位不要从字面上理解我们在这里不得不使用的修辞说法。使用这些，无非是表达一个人和一座建筑物之间奇特、匀称、直接、宛若同体的结合。同时也不必赘言，在这样长期、这样密切的共居之中，他对整个主教堂已经是多么熟悉。这座寓所也就是他自己所固有的。其中没有一个深处卡席莫多没有进去过，没有一个高处他没有爬上去过。他曾经多次仅仅抓住雕塑物的突出部分，攀缘那升起数级的正面。常常可以看见他像一只爬行在笔立的墙壁上的壁虎，在两座钟楼上攀登。这两尊双生的巨岸建筑物，那样巍峨，那样迫人，那样可畏，他爬上去并不觉得头晕目眩，不感到恐怖，也不惊呆得摇晃不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To see them so gentle under his hand, so easy to scale, one would have said that he had tamed them. By dint of leaping, climbing, gambolling amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become, in some sort, a monkey and a goat, like the Calabrian child who swims before he walks, and plays with the sea while still a babe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看见这两座钟楼那样听从他的摆布，那样容易攀登，你会觉得他已经把它们驯服了。在这伟岸主教堂的各个悬岩峭壁中间时常跳跃、攀登、嬉戏，他就或多或少变成了猿猴、羚羊，又像是意大利南部海边的孩子，会走之前就会游泳，十分幼小就跟大海玩耍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In closing, it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo. His soul fell into profound night. The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity. Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb. For, in order not to make others laugh, the very moment that he found himself to be deaf, he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone. He voluntarily tied that tongue which Claude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose. Hence, it came about, that when necessity constrained him to speak, his tongue was torpid, awkward, and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样一关闭，就截断了那仍然渗透卡席莫多灵魂的唯一欢乐的光明。这个灵魂从此坠入无边的黑夜。这苦命人的忧伤也就如同他的畸形一般不可治疗、登峰造极了。不仅如此，耳朵一聋，他也就在某种程度上哑了。因为，为了不让别人讥笑，他从发现自己聋了的时候起，就坚决决定沉默不语，只在自己一人时才间或打破沉默。他的舌头，克洛德·弗罗洛费了很大气力才松开来的，现在他自己自愿重新扎结起来。因此，偶尔迫不得已只好讲话的时候，他的舌头已经麻木，显得笨拙，就像一扇门的铰链已经锈了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Moreover, it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral, but his mind also. In what condition was that mind? What bent had it contracted, what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope, in that savage life? This it would be hard to determine. Quasimodo had been born one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame. It was with great difficulty, and by dint of great patience that Claude Frollo had succeeded in teaching him to talk. But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling. Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen, a new infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes: the bells had broken the drums of his ears; he had become deaf. The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed, and forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不仅如此，不单单他的身体似乎已经按照主教堂的模样塑造成型，就是他的灵魂也是这样。这个灵魂是怎样的状态呢？他的灵魂，在这样扭结的外囊之下，在这样狂野的生命之中，形成了怎样的褶皱，构成了怎样的形状呢？这是很难说清楚的。卡席莫多天生独眼、驼背、跛足。克洛德·弗罗洛好不容易，以极大的耐性才教会他说话。然而，注定的厄运紧迫着这可怜的弃婴。圣母院打钟人在十四岁上又得了一个残疾：钟声震破了他的耳膜，他聋了，这下子可就一应俱全了。造化本来为他向外界敞开的唯一门户，从此猛然永远关闭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of Quasimodo through that thick, hard rind; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed organism; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque creature, to elucidate his obscure corners, his absurd no-thoroughfares, and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the extremity of that cave, we should, no doubt, find the unhappy Psyche in some poor, cramped, and ricketty attitude, like those prisoners beneath the Leads of Venice, who grew old bent double in a stone box which was both too low and too short for them.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body. Quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image, moving blindly within him. The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind. His brain was a peculiar medium; the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted. The reflection which resulted from this refraction was, necessarily, divergent and perverted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身体畸形，精神必定萎缩。卡席莫多简直感觉不到还会有什么灵魂按照他的模样塑成，在他身体里面盲目活动。外界事物的印象先得大大折射一番，才能达到他的思想。他的脑子是一种特殊的介质：思想只要是通过去，出来的时候无一不面目全非。经过这番曲折之后的反射，势所必然，都是杂乱无章、偏离正道的。">查看中文翻译</div>

As he grew up, he had found nothing but hatred around him. He had caught the general malevolence. He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded.</div>

<div class="line_en">And the cathedral was not only society for him, but the universe, and all nature beside. He dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows, always in flower; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out, loaded with birds, in the tufts of the Saxon capitals; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church; of no other ocean than Paris, roaring at their bases.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，主教堂不仅是他的交往圈子，也是他的宇宙，还是他的整个大自然。他不必向往其他花园，有那些花开不谢的花玻璃窗就尽够了；不必追求其他树荫，那石刻叶饰永远绿荫如织，葱茏的萨克逊式拱柱上始终鸟鸣婉转；不必渴望其他山峰，只需要主教堂那两座巍峨钟楼；不必渴求其他海洋，巴黎就在钟楼脚下如海似潮轰响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After all, he turned his face towards men only with reluctance; his cathedral was sufficient for him. It was peopled with marble figures, -- kings, saints, bishops, -- who at least did not burst out laughing in his face, and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity and kindliness. The other statues, those of the monsters and demons, cherished no hatred for him, Quasimodo. He resembled them too much for that. They seemed rather, to be scoffing at other men. The saints were his friends, and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and guarded him. So he held long communion with them. He sometimes passed whole hours crouching before one of these statues, in solitary conversation with it. If any one came, he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade.</div>

<div class="line_en">What he loved above all else in the maternal edifice, that which aroused his soul, and made it open its poor wings, which it kept so miserably folded in its cavern, that which sometimes rendered him even happy, was the bells. He loved them, fondled them, talked to them, understood them. From the chime in the spire, over the intersection of the aisles and nave, to the great bell of the front, he cherished a tenderness for them all. The central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages, whose birds, reared by himself, sang for him alone. Yet it was these very bells which had made him deaf; but mothers often love best that child which has caused them the most suffering.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear. On this score, the big bell was his beloved. It was she whom he preferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above him, on festival days. This bell was named Marie. She was alone in the southern tower, with her sister Jacqueline, a bell of lesser size, shut up in a smaller cage beside hers. This Jacqueline was so called from the name of the wife of Jean Montagu, who had given it to the church, which had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at Montfauçon. In the second tower there were six other bells, and, finally, six smaller ones inhabited the belfry over the crossing, with the wooden bell, which rang only between after dinner on Good Friday and the morning of the day before Easter. So Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his seraglio; but big Marie was his favorite.</div>

<div class="line_en">No idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was sounded. At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him, and said, "Go!" he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any one else could have descended it. He entered perfectly breathless into the aerial chamber of the great bell; he gazed at her a moment, devoutly and lovingly; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand, like a good horse, which is about to set out on a long journey. He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer. After these first caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story of the tower, to begin. They grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion. Quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled. The first shock of the clapper and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver. Quasimodo vibrated with the bell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钟声大作的日子，他是多么兴高采烈，真是无法想象。副主教只要放他走，对他说“去吧！”他就急忙爬上钟楼的转梯，其急速比别人爬下来还快。他上气不接下气，跑进大钟的那间四面通风的房子，静默着，满怀柔情地端详它半晌，然后对它轻言曼语，用手抚摸它，仿佛它是一匹骏马即将奔驰长行。它即将辛苦服役，他感到心疼。爱抚之后，他呼唤钟楼下一层的另外几口钟，叫它们开始。它们就悬吊在缆绳上，绞盘轧轧响，那巨大的金属大圆盅（33）缓缓晃动起来。卡席莫多的心剧烈跳动，眼睛盯着它摇摆。钟舌刚一撞上青铜钟壁，他爬上去站着的那个木架就颤动起来。卡席莫多同大钟一起颤抖。【注：（33）指大钟。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Vah!" he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter. However, the movement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described a wider angle, Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely, phosphoric and flaming. At length the grand peal began; the whole tower trembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the piles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit. Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower. The bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two walls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that tempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away. Quasimodo stationed himself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the oscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed by turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet below him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after second, to howl in his ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他疯狂地大笑，喊道：“干呀！”这时，这口声音沉浊的大钟加速摇摆，它以更大的角度来回摆动，卡席莫多的眼睛也就越来越火光熠熠。终于，钟乐大作，整个钟楼都战栗了：从根茎的木桩直至屋顶上的梅花装饰，木架啦，铅皮啦，砌石啦，一齐呻吟起来。于是，卡席莫多大为激动，满口白沫直喷；他跑过来，跑过去；从头到脚，跟着钟楼一起颤动。大钟这时大发癫狂，左右摇摆，青铜大口一会对着钟楼这边侧壁，一会对着那边侧壁，喷吐出暴风雨般的咆哮声，四法里（34）之外都可以听见。卡席莫多蹲在大张着的钟口面前，随着大钟的来回摆动，一会蹲下，一会又站起来，他呼吸着这令人惊恐的大钟喘息，一会瞧着脚下两百尺那无数生命悸动着的深渊广场，一会瞧着那一秒钟又一秒钟捶击他耳鼓的巨大铜舌。【注：（34）旧制法里约合4公里。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke for him the universal silence. He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun. All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main. Then, suspended above the abyss, borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body. Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a bellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting, beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor Quasimodo: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他唯一听得见的言语，唯一为他打破了万籁俱寂的静默的声音。他狂喜不已，犹如鸟雀沐浴着阳光。突然，大钟的疯狂感染了他，他目光狂乱了，等着大钟摇摆过来，就像蜘蛛等着苍蝇，忽然纵身猛扑上去。他悬空吊在深渊上面，抓住青铜巨怪的耳朵，双膝紧夹着，用脚踵驱策它，随着大钟的猛烈晃荡，以整个身子的冲击力，以全身的重量，加剧钟声的轰然鸣响。这时，钟楼震撼了；他叫嚣着，牙齿咬得直响，棕红色头发倒竖起来，胸膛里发出风箱般的声音，两眼喷火，巨钟在他身下喘息着嘶叫；于是，圣母院洪钟不复存在，卡席莫多也不复存在，只有梦幻，只有旋风，只有狂风暴雨；这是骑乘着音响的晕眩，这是紧攀着飞马的灵魂，这是半人半钟的奇特生物，这是驾驭着活生生的非凡青铜鹰翼马身怪物飞奔的可怕的阿斯托夫（35）。【注：（35）阿斯托夫，英国传说中的王子，他的号角能发出可怕的声音。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral. It seemed as though there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate. It sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion. And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit. One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe. He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure. Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows. Again, in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching and scowling; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought. Sometimes one caught sight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus. Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame. Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking. And, if it was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was watching it. And all this came from Quasimodo. Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon: he was in fact its soul.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有这个非凡生物存在，整个主教堂里就洋溢着难以形容的生气。似乎从他身上——至少按照群众的夸张的迷信说法是这样——散发出一种神秘的气息，使得圣母院所有的石头都有了生命，古老教堂的整个心肝五脏都悸动起来了。人们只要知道他在那里，就会感觉到亲眼瞅见了走廊里和门道上千千万万座塑像都有了生命，动起来了。确实，整个主教堂都好像是一个对他百依百顺的生物，他意志所至，它就立刻发出洪亮的呐喊。卡席莫多宛如一个形影不离的精灵依附于它身上，也充溢在整个教堂里。仿佛是他使这宏大的建筑物呼吸起来。他确实无处不在，化作无数的卡席莫多，遍布于建筑物各个地方。有时，人们惊恐地看见钟楼最高处有一个异样侏儒攀登、蠕行，手脚并用在攀缘，从外面降下深渊，从一个棱角到一个棱角跳跃，要钻到某个雕塑的果贡（36）的肚子里去搜索：这就是卡席莫多在掏乌鸦窠。有时，又会在主教堂的某个阴暗角落里碰见某种活着的希迈尔（37），神色阴郁地蹲在那里：那是卡席莫多在沉思。有时，又会在钟楼下面瞅见有颗大脑袋和互不协调的四肢在吊着一根绳索拼命摇摆：这是卡席莫多在敲晚祷钟或奉告祈祷钟（38）。时常在夜里看见有个丑恶的形体，游荡在钟楼顶上那排环绕着底下半圆室周围不牢靠的、锯齿似的栏杆上：这又是圣母院的驼子。于是，附近的女人都说，整个主教堂都显得怪异、超自然、可怖，这里或那里都有眼睛和嘴巴张着，到处听见这怪异教堂周围昼夜伸着脖子、张着嘴巴守护着的那些石犬、石蟒、石龙在吼叫。如果是圣诞夜，大钟似乎在咆哮，召唤信徒们去望热烈的午夜弥撒，阴沉的门面上弥漫着一种气氛，使人还以为那大门拱吞噬了人群，那花瓣格子窗在凝视着人们。而这一切都是来自卡席莫多。假如是在埃及，人们会把他当作这座庙宇的尊神；中世纪的人却以为他是庙宇的鬼怪；其实，他是它的灵魂。【注：（36）果贡，希腊神话中的蛇发女怪，人只要被它看见就立即化为石头。（37）希迈尔，狮首羊肚龙尾的喷火怪物。（38）奉告祈祷钟，早、中、晚三次奉告圣母的祈祷时的钟声。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that Quasimodo has existed, Notre-Dame is to-day deserted, inanimate, dead. One feels that something has disappeared from it. That immense body is empty; it is a skeleton; the spirit has quitted it, one sees its place and that is all. It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes, but no longer sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，在那些知道卡席莫多存在过的人们看来，今天的圣母院是荒凉的、没有生气的、死气沉沉的。他们感觉到缺少了什么。这个巨大的身躯已经空了，只剩下骨架，没有了灵魂，空余着寓居过的地方，仅此而已。就好像是一颗头颅空有两个长眼睛的窟窿，目光却没有了。">查看中文翻译</div>
