<div class="line_en">There, Tully fell into bed, staring blearily up at her best friend. Now, with the room tumbling around her, she realized how stupid an idea this documentary was, how firmly she'd planted herself in harm's way. She could be hurt… again. If only she had Kate's life; then Tully wouldn't have to take this risk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉倒在床上，恍惚地看着好友。她觉得整个房间在转，此刻她终于明白拍摄纪录片的主意有多蠢，根本是自讨苦吃，她一定会…再一次受伤。假使她拥有凯蒂的人生，就不必冒这种险了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their first stop, only two hours later, was at a mobile home park in Fall City. Cloud's last known address. But her mother had apparently moved out a week ago and no one yet had a forwarding address. The man they spoke to thought Cloud had moved to a campground in Issaquah.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个小时后，他们抵达第一站，华盛顿佛尔市的一处组合屋村，这是白云最近一次通知的地址。不过，她妈妈一个星期前搬走了，没人知道她下一个落脚处的地址，管理员说她好像去了伊萨夸的一个露营区。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very funny." Tully glanced down at her stuff. On top was a pile of notes she'd taken in the most recent phone conversation with her lawyer. It was a list of the last addresses they had for Cloud. "Okay, then. I'm out of here." She grabbed her bag and went out to the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真会开玩笑。”塔莉低头看看行李，最上层放着一叠笔记，那是她和律师联络之后取得的资料，他们将白云最近住过的地方列成一张清单。“好，我走了。”她拎起包包上车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next six hours they drove from place to place, following leads -- Tully, Johnny, Marah, and a cameraman who called himself Fat Bob for good reason. At every stop, they filmed a segment of Tully talking to people at the various campgrounds and communes. Several people knew who Cloud was, but no one seemed to know where to find her. They went from Issaquah to Cle Elem to Ellensburg. Marah hung on Tully's every word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来六个小时他们追寻线索跑了很多地方，他们的成员包括塔莉、强尼、玛拉，以及自称胖鲍伯的摄影师——他这个绰号有着足够的根据。每次停车，塔莉便去找露营区或公社里的人打听，其他人则跟随拍摄。很多人知道白云这个人，但不晓得她去了哪里。他们从伊萨夸去了克雷兰，然后又去到艾伦斯堡[76]。玛拉认真听着塔莉说的每句话。【注：[76]这些城市皆在华盛顿州内。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Johnny looked at her. "I think we can't make people love us."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You think we'll find her?" Tully asked, pouring sugar into her coffee. It was the first time they'd been alone all day. Fat Bob was in the van and Marah had just gone to the restroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得能找到她？”塔莉往咖啡里加糖，一整天下来，他们第一次有机会独处。胖鲍伯在车上，玛拉去厕所了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning Tully woke with a pounding headache that no amount of aspirin could tame. Still, she got dressed and put on her makeup and ate breakfast at some greasy spoon diner that Fat Bob recommended. By nine in the morning they were on the ferry, headed to a berry-growing commune on Vashon Island.</div>

<div class="line_en">The commune was like others she'd seen: long, rolling acres covered in crops, shaggy-looking people dressed in the modern-day equivalent of sackcloth and ashes, rows of Sani-Cans.

She'd spent a lifetime shellacking her heart, creating this hard casing around it, and now she was purposely peeling it away, exposing her vulnerability. But what choice did she have?

<div class="line_cn" title="那个女人告诉他们该怎么去，塔莉感到一阵焦虑。她想一个人静一静，于是走到一旁的篱笆前，强尼过来找她，靠在她耳边问：“你还好吧？”他不想被摄影机录到，所以声音压得很低。">查看中文翻译</div>

On Mill Road they turned left and drove down a bumpy, rutted gravel road until an old beige mobile home came into view. It sat on blocks in a grassy field, surrounded by rusted, broken-down cars. A refrigerator lay on its side in the front yard; a threadbare, broken recliner beside it. Three ragged-looking pit bulls were chained to the fence. They went crazy when the van pulled into the yard, barking and snarling and jumping forward.</div>
