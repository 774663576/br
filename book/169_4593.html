<div class="line_en">The hall was loud with drunken Harlaws, distant cousins all. Each lord had hung his banner behind the benches where his men were seated. Too few, thought Asha Greyjoy, looking down from the gallery, too few by far. The benches were three-quarters empty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Qarl the Maid had said as much, when the Black Wind was approaching from the sea. He had counted the longships moored beneath her uncle's castle, and his mouth had tightened. "They have not come," he observed, "or not enough of them." He was not wrong, but Asha could not agree with him, out where her crew might hear. She did not doubt their devotion, but even ironborn will hesitate to give their lives for a cause that's plainly lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑风号抵达时，“处女”科尔便如此评价。他数了数她舅舅城堡下停泊的长船，抿紧嘴巴。“他们没来，”他说，“或者说来的人不够。”他讲的是实话，但阿莎不能附和，因为那样或许会被船员们听见。她不怀疑他们的忠诚，但假若从事一项必败无疑的事业，即便是铁岛人，也会犹豫彷徨的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Do I have so few friends as this? Amongst the banners, she saw the silver fish of Botley, the stone tree of the Stonetrees, the black leviathan of Volmark, the nooses of the Myres. The rest were Harlaw scythes. Boremund placed his upon a pale blue field, Hotho's was girdled within an embattled border, and the Knight had quartered his with the gaudy peacock of his mother's House. Even Sigfryd Silverhair showed two scythes counterchanged on a field divided bendwise. Only the Lord Harlaw displayed the silver scythe plain upon a night-black field, as it had flown in the dawn of days: Rodrik, called the Reader, Lord of the Ten Towers, Lord of Harlaw, Harlaw of Harlaw… her favorite uncle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Rodrik's high seat was vacant. Two scythes of beaten silver crossed above it, so huge that even a giant would have difficulty wielding them, but beneath were only empty cushions. Asha was not surprised. The feast was long concluded. Only bones and greasy platters remained upon the trestle tables. The rest was drinking, and her uncle Rodrik had never been partial to the company of quarrelsome drunks. She turned to Three-Tooth, an old woman of fearful age who had been her uncle's steward since she was known as Twelve-Tooth. "My uncle is with his books?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，罗德利克头领的高背椅空空的。椅子上方有两把交叉的巨型银镰刀，大得连巨人也难以挥舞，可舅舅早已离开，阿莎对此并不惊讶。毕竟，宴会已告结束，搁板桌上只剩骨头和油腻的盘子。大家都在喝酒，而她舅舅罗德利克从不与吵闹的醉汉为伍。她转向“三颗牙”，一位极其年迈的老妇人，刚开始当管家那会儿叫“十二颗牙”。“我舅舅泡在书堆里？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye, where else?" The woman was so old that a septon had once said she must have nursed the Crone. That was when the Faith was still tolerated on the isles. Lord Rodrik had kept septons at Ten Towers, not for his soul's sake but for his books. "With the books, and Botley. He was with him too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，还能上哪儿去呢？”那妇人如此年迈，以至于修士曾说，她一定给老妪当过保姆。当时的铁群岛仍能容忍七神信仰，罗德利克头领便在十塔城蓄养修士，这并非为了救赎灵魂，而是为了帮他抄书。“他泡在书堆里，波特利也在。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aye, where else? The widow the tower was named after was her aunt. Lady Gwynesse had come home to mourn after her husband had died off Fair Isle during Balon Greyjoy's first rebellion. "I will only stay until my grief has passed," she had told her brother, famously, "though by rights Ten Towers should be mine, for I am seven years your elder." Long years had passed since then, but still the widow lingered, grieving, and muttering from time to time that the castle should be hers. And now Lord Rodrik has a second half-mad widowed sister beneath his roof, Asha reflected. Small wonder if he seeks solace in his books.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是啊，还能在哪儿？寡妇塔得名于她姨母，这是关妮丝夫人服丧之处，她挚爱的丈夫在巴隆·葛雷乔伊第一次反叛期间战死于仙女岛。“等悲伤成为过去，我就会离开，”她告诉弟弟的话众人皆知，“不过十塔城照权利应属于我，因为我比你大七岁。”自那以后，已有许多年，寡妇却仍留在此处伤心，时不时还会唠叨城堡应该是她的。如今罗德利克大人的屋檐下又多出一个半疯的寡妇妹妹，阿莎寻思，难怪他要在书本中寻求慰藉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even now, it was hard to credit that frail, sickly Lady Alannys had outlived her husband Lord Balon, who had seemed so hard and strong. When Asha had sailed away to war, she had done so with a heavy heart, fearing that her mother might well die before she could return. Not once had she thought that her father might perish instead. The Drowned God plays savage japes upon us all, but men are crueler still. A sudden storm and a broken rope had sent Balon Greyjoy to his death. Or so they claim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说实话，大家很难相信脆弱多病的亚拉妮丝夫人竟比巴隆大王活得长，她父亲平素在人前人后都显得是那样坚定强壮。阿莎出海打仗时心情沉重，害怕母亲在她回来之前死去，不料殒命的反而是父亲。淹神爱开残忍的玩笑，不过，最残忍的难道不是人吗？一阵突如其来的风暴和一条断裂的索桥要了巴隆。葛雷乔伊的命。至少他们对外如此宣布。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mother's skin had been parchment thin, her long hair white. Some pride remained in the way she held her head, but her eyes were dim and cloudy, and her mouth had trembled when she asked after Theon. "Did you bring my baby boy?" she had asked. Theon had been ten years old when he was carried off to Winterfell a hostage, and so far as Lady Alannys was concerned he would always be ten years old, it seemed. "Theon could not come," Asha had to tell her. "Father sent him reaving along the Stony Shore." Lady Alannys had naught to say to that. She only nodded slowly, yet it was plain to see how deep her daughter's words had cut her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲的皮肤像羊皮纸一样薄，长头发已褪色成花白，虽然昂首的姿态中仍有些许残存的骄傲，但她的眼睛阴暗朦胧，问起席恩时，嘴巴不住颤抖。“你有没有把我的小宝贝儿带回来啊？”她问。席恩十岁时被当做人质送去临冬城，亚拉妮丝夫人似乎认定他一直停留在十岁大。“席恩来不了，”阿莎只能告诉她，“父亲派他沿磐石海岸劫掠。”亚拉妮丝夫人无言以对，只是缓缓点头，然而明显能看出来，女儿的话伤她有多深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Asha had last seen her mother when she stopped at Ten Towers to take on fresh water, on her way north to strike at Deepwood Motte. Alannys Harlaw never had the sort of beauty the singers cherished, but her daughter had loved her fierce strong face and the laughter in her eyes. On that last visit, though, she had found Lady Alannys in a window seat huddled beneath a pile of furs, staring out across the sea. Is this my mother, or her ghost? she remembered thinking as she'd kissed her cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿莎上次见到母亲是去北方攻击深林堡途中，停下来在十塔城装水。亚拉妮丝·哈尔洛从来没有歌手们青睐的那种美，但她女儿喜爱她那张坚强刚烈的脸庞，喜爱她眼中的笑意。然而上次造访时，她发现亚拉妮丝夫人坐在临窗坐椅上，裹着一堆毛皮，凝视海面。这是我母亲还是她的鬼魂？她记得自己亲吻母亲脸颊时这么想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was good to walk these halls again. Ten Towers had always felt like home to Asha, more so than Pyke. Not one castle, ten castles squashed together, she had thought, the first time she had seen it. She remembered breathless races up and down the steps and along wallwalks and covered bridges, fishing off the Long Stone Quay, days and nights lost amongst her uncle's wealth of books. His grandfather's grandfather had raised the castle, the newest on the isles. Lord Theomore Harlaw had lost three sons in the cradle and laid the blame upon the flooded cellars, damp stones, and festering nitre of ancient Harlaw Hall. Ten Towers was airier, more comfortable, better sited… but Lord Theomore was a changeable man, as any of his wives might have testified. He'd had six of those, as dissimilar as his ten towers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再度行走于熟悉的厅堂，感觉真好，对阿莎而言，十塔城就像家，比派克岛更亲切。初次见到它时，她曾想，这哪里是一座城，分明是十座城堡挤在一起。她记得自己气喘吁吁地奔上奔下，沿着城墙走道和封闭的廊桥追逐，记得在长石码头边钓鱼，记得日日夜夜迷失在舅舅丰富的藏书中。舅舅的祖父的祖父建筑了这座城，它乃是群屿中最崭新的家堡。当年席奥默·哈尔洛头领失去了三个襁褓中的儿子，便归咎于积水的地窖、潮湿的岩石以及侵入古老哈尔洛厅各个角落的硝石。十塔城更通风，更舒适，位置也更佳…可惜席奥默头领毕竟生性善变——对此他的每个老婆都能作证。他有六个风格迥异的老婆，正如他修的十座塔各不相同。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Book Tower was the fattest of the ten, octagonal in shape and made with great blocks of hewn stone. The stair was built within the thickness of the walls. Asha climbed quickly, to the fifth story and the room where her uncle read. Not that there are any rooms where he does not read. Lord Rodrik was seldom seen without a book in hand, be it in the privy, on the deck of his Sea Song, or whilst holding audience. Asha had oft seen him reading on his high seat beneath the silver scythes. He would listen to each case as it was laid before him, pronounce his judgment… and read a bit whilst his captain-ofguards went to bring in the next supplicant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="藏书塔在十座塔楼中最为粗壮，呈八角形，由经过切割的大石块筑成。楼梯建在厚厚的墙壁之内，阿莎迅速登上第五层，来到舅舅读书的房间。其实他在哪里都会读书。无论在厕所，在“海歌号”的甲板上，甚至接受觐见时，罗德利克头领都是手不释卷。阿莎经常看见他坐在银镰刀下的高背椅上一边读书，一边听取请愿，宣布裁断…每当侍卫队长去带下一个求见者时，他便能多看一会儿书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She found him hunched over a table by a window, surrounded by parchment scrolls that might have come from Valyria before its Doom, and heavy leather-bound books with bronze-and-iron hasps. Beeswax candles as thick and tall as a man's arm burned on either side of where he sat, on ornate iron holders. Lord Rodrik Harlaw was neither fat nor slim; neither tall nor short; neither ugly nor handsome. His hair was brown, as were his eyes, though the short, neat beard he favored had gone grey. All in all, he was an ordinary man, distinguished only by his love of written words, which so many ironborn found unmanly and perverse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，他正伏在靠窗的桌边，被羊皮纸卷轴所包围——这些卷轴或许来自于末日浩劫降临前的瓦雷利亚——周围还躺着几卷皮革封面、铜铁搭扣的沉重典籍，而跟人的手臂一般粗一般长的蜂蜡蜡烛插在精美的铁烛台里，在座位两侧燃烧。罗德利克头领不胖不瘦，不高不矮，不俊也不丑。他的头发是褐色，眼睛也一样，他喜欢将胡子修得短而整洁，那胡子已变成了灰色。总而言之，他是个普普通通的人，除了对白纸黑字的偏爱之外毫无特点，然而对大多数铁民而言，读书是怪癖，不是男子汉该干的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

Her own men would be solidly behind her, but she would need the rest as well, her Harlaw cousins, the Volmarks, and the Stonetrees. Those are the ones I must win. Her victory at Deepwood Motte would serve her in good stead, once her men began to boast of it, as she knew they would. The crew of her Black Wind took a perverse pride in the deeds of their woman captain. Half of them loved her like a daughter, and other half wanted to spread her legs, but either sort would die for her.

Of the five boys her mother had brought to Pyke to foster after Ned Stark had taken her last living son as hostage, Tris had been closest to Asha in age.

Even so, she'd called it love, till Tris began to go on about the children she would bear him; a dozen sons at least, and oh, some daughters too. "I don't want to have a dozen sons," she had told him, appalled. "I want to have adventures." Not long after, Maester Qalen found them at their play, and young Tristifer Botley was sent away to Blacktyde.</div>
