<div class="line_en">She knew him very little then, and now, though they had been married for nearly two years, she knew him but little more. At first she had been touched by his kindness and flattered, though surprised, by his passion. He was extremely considerate; he was very attentive to her comfort; she never expressed the slightest wish without his hastening to gratify it. He was constantly giving her little presents. When she happened to feel ill no one could have been kinder or more thoughtful. She seemed to do him a favour when she gave him the opportunity of doing something tiresome for her. And he was always exceedingly polite. He rose to his feet when she entered a room, he gave her his hand to help her out of a car, if he chanced to meet her in the street he took off his hat, he was solicitous to open the door for her when she left a room, he never came into her bedroom or her boudoir without a knock. He treated her not as Kitty had seen most men treat their wives, but as though she were a fellow-guest in a country house. It was pleasing and yet a trifle comic. She would have felt more at home with him if he had been more casual. Nor did their conjugal relations draw her closer to him. He was passionate then, fierce, oddly hysterical too, and sentimental.</div>

<div class="line_en">If disconcerted her to realize how emotional he really was. His self-control was due to shyness or to long training, she did not know which; it seemed to her faintly contemptible that when she lay in his arms, his desire appeased, he who was so timid of saying absurd things, who so feared to be ridiculous, should use baby talk. She had offended him bitterly once by laughing and telling him that he was talking the most fearful slush. She had felt his arms grow limp about her, he remained quite silent for a little while, and then without a word released her and went into his own room. She didn't want to hurt his feelings and a day or two later she said to him</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很惊讶地发现他是多么地情绪化。他平时的自制要么源于害羞，要么是长久养成的习惯，她不确定是哪一种。等到她躺到他的怀里，他变得心满意足时，平时绝不敢说荒唐话、绝不敢做荒唐事的人，竟然满口小孩儿气的话。这让她多少开始瞧不起他。有一次她讥笑说，他说的是世界上最吓人的胡话。她感觉到他的胳膊松了下来，他半天没说话，然后放开她一个人回到自己的卧室。她不想伤害他的感情，一两天过后，她对他说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had laughed in a shamefaced way. She had discovered very soon that he had an unhappy disability to lose himself. He was self-conscious. When there was a party and every one started singing Walter could never bring himself to join in. He sat there smiling to show that he was pleased and amused, but his smile was forced: it was more like a sarcastic smirk, and you could not help feeling that he thought all those people enjoying themselves a pack of fools. He could not bring himself to play the round games which Kitty with her high spirits found such a lark. On their journey out to China he had absolutely refused to put on fancy dress when everyone else was wearing it. It disturbed her pleasure that he should so obviously think the whole thing a bore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他只是羞涩地笑了笑。不久以后她发现他很难融入到别人的圈子里去。他太过难为情了。要是在晚会上，大家都开始唱歌，里面保准没有瓦尔特。他面带微笑坐在一旁，似乎也从中得到了快乐，但实际上他的笑是装出来的。他的笑更像是在嘲讽，让人觉得在他心里这些自娱自乐的人根本是一群傻瓜。轮流唱歌是多么令凯蒂兴高采烈的事，然而他就是不肯加入进去。在去中国的途中他们参加了一次化装舞会，让他像别人一样穿上奇装异服连门儿也没有。显然他认为这些都是无聊透顶，这很让她扫兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty was lively; she was willing to chatter all day long and she laughed easily. His silence disconcerted her. He had a way which exasperated her of returning no answer to some casual remark of hers. It was true that it needed no answer, but an answer all the same would have been pleasant. If it was raining and she said: "It's raining cats and dogs," she would have liked him to say: "Yes, isn't it?" He remained silent. Sometimes she would have liked to shake him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂天生活泼，她愿意一天到晚说个不停，想笑就笑。他的沉默却常常浇灭她的热情。对于她说的闲聊话，他从来不搭腔，这让她愤懑。那些话题的确不需要特别的回答，但是有人回应毕竟令人高兴。要是外面下雨了，她会说：“雨下得好大啊。”她等着他说：“嗯，是啊。”然而他却像个闷葫芦。有时她真想上去摇摇他的脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It showed that he had not meant to be offensive. He did not speak because he had nothing to say. But if nobody spoke unless he had something to say, Kitty reflected, with a smile, the human race would very soon lose the use of speech.</div>
