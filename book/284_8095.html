<div class="line_en">The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not stopped pouring down. There could be no going out of doors. Martha was so busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery. She came bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing nothing else.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He isn't yet," said Martha. "But he began all wrong. Mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th' house to set any child wrong. They was afraid his back was weak an' they've always been takin' care of it-keepin' him lyin' down an' not lettin' him walk. Once they made him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill. Then a big doctor came to see him an' made them take it off. He talked to th' other doctor quite rough -- in a polite way. He said there'd been too much medicine and too much lettin' him have his own way."</div>

To talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week -- and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies. And about Dickon's mother-and the skipping-rope-and the moor with the sun on it-and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod. And it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she had ever talked before-and Colin both talked and listened as he had never done either before. And they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together.
