<div class="line_en">The ebb was to fall early in the morning. I knew that if the wind held from the northwest and no interfering swell ran in from a distant storm the level of the sea should drop below the entrance to the pool. There had been sudden ominous showers in the night, with rain like handfuls of gravel flung on the roof. When I looked out into the early morning the sky was full of a gray dawn light but the sun had not yet risen. Water and air were pallid. Across the bay the moon was a luminous disc in the western sky, suspended above the dim line of distant shore -- the full August moon, drawing the tide to the low, low levels of the threshold of the alien sea world. As I watched, a gull flew by, above the spruces. Its breast was rosy with the light of the unrisen sun. The day was, after all, to be fair.</div>

<div class="line_en">The shore is an ancient world, for as long as there has been an earth and sea there has been this place of the meeting of land and water. Yet it is a world that keeps alive the sense of continuing creation and of the relentless drive of life. Each time that I enter it, I gain some new awareness of its beauty and its deeper meanings, sensing that intricate fabric of life by which one creature is linked with another, and each with its surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海岸是一个古老的世界，自从有了大地和海洋，便有了这个水陆相接的地方。然而，这个世界时刻展现的都是一派生命不息、造物不止的景象。每次我走进这个世界，都会感受到生物与生物、生物与环境之间错综复杂的生命网络结构，继而对它的美丽和意蕴平添了几分更新更深的认识。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In my thoughts of the shore, one place stands apart for its revelation of exquisite beauty. It is a pool hidden within a cave that one can visit only rarely and briefly when the lowest of the year's low tides fall below it, and perhaps from that very fact it acquires some of its special beauty. Choosing such a tide, I hoped for a glimpse of the pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每每想到海岸，总有一个地方不同于其他，只因它的美实在特别。这个地方便是隐匿于岩洞中的一汪水潭，人们只能偶尔在每年低潮期、潮退至低于水潭时匆匆一瞥它的美，或许正因为此，它才美得那么特别。择好一个这样的低潮时机，希望自己能有幸看一眼那汪水潭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so I knelt on the wet carpet of sea moss and looked back into the dark cavern that held the pool in a shallow basin. The floor of the cave was only a few inches below the roof, and a mirror had been created in which all that grew on the ceiling was reflected in the still water below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，在湿漉漉的海藻铺就的地毯上，我跪下来折过身子向后探视黑暗岩洞的内里，正是那一池清浅水潭。洞底距离洞顶也不过几英寸，那水潭就如一面明镜，将洞顶所有的生命百态倒映在平静的水面中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, as I stood above the tide near the entrance to the pool, the promise of that rosy light was sustained. From the base of the steep wall of rock on which I stood, a moss covered ledge jutted seaward into deep water. In the surge at the rim of the ledge the dark fronds of oar weeds swayed smooth and gleaming as leather. The projecting ledge was the path to the small hidden cave and its pool. Occasionally a swell, stronger than the rest, rolled smoothly over the rim and broke in foam against the cliff. But the intervals between such swells were long enough to admit me to the ledge and long enough for a glimpse of that fairy pool, so seldom and so briefly exposed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，当我站到水潭入口附近的潮水上方时，等待我的依旧是玫红色的天光。我的脚下是峭岩底部，只见一块长满苔藓的岩礁从这里直直延伸到大海深处。潮起时，岩礁边缘攀附的深色海藻叶随流水轻轻拂动，闪耀着皮质般的光泽。延伸的岩礁就是通往狭小隐蔽的岩洞和水潭的小路。间或涌来一阵凶猛异常的潮水，翻滚着漫过岩礁边缘，拍打到岩壁上碎作水沫。但这种潮水间隔很长时间才会涌来一次，因此我有足够的时间走上岩架，也有足够的时间看一眼那罕见的、仅存片刻的水潭仙境。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under water that was clear as glass the pool was carpeted with green sponge. Gray patches of sea squirts glistened on the ceiling and colonies of raft coral were a pale apricot color. In the moment when I looked into the cave a little elfin starfish hung down, suspended by the merest thread, perhaps by only a single tube foot. It reached down to touch its own reflection, so perfectly delineated that there might have been, not one starfish, but two. The beauty of the reflected images and of the limpid pool itself was the poignant beauty of things that are ephemeral, existing only until the sea should return to fill the little cave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玻璃般清澈的水池底部铺着一层绿色的海绵。一片片灰色海鞘在洞顶闪闪发光，一簇簇珊瑚透着杏黄色光泽。我朝洞中看去的一刹那，只见一只小海星如精灵般顽皮地倒悬在洞顶的一根细线上，或者就是它的一只管足。小海星垂下身去够它自己的倒影，这幅画面实在太完美了，就仿佛那里有一对海星，而非一只。所有这些倒影的美和清澈水潭自身的美，都属于转瞬即逝令人心碎的美，因为海水重新注满小洞后，一切都将不复存在。">查看中文翻译</div>
