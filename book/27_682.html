<div class="line_en">She described a world in which drugs would be minutely tailored to individuals thanks to Theranos's blood-monitoring technology. To illustrate her point, she cited Celebrex, a painkiller that was under a cloud because it was thought to increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. There was talk that its maker, Pfizer, would have to pull it from the market. With the Theranos system, Celebrex's side effects could be eliminated, allowing millions of arthritis sufferers to keep taking the drug to alleviate their aches and pains, she explained. Elizabeth cited the fact that an estimated one hundred thousand Americans died each year from adverse drug reactions. Theranos would eliminate all those deaths, she said. It would quite literally save lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">It didn't take Ed long to realize that Theranos was the toughest engineering challenge he'd ever tackled. His experience was in electronics, not medical devices. And the prototype he'd inherited didn't really work. It was more like a mock-up of what Elizabeth had in mind. He had to turn the mock-up into a functioning device.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久艾德蒙就发现，Theranos是他处理过最棘手的工程挑战。他的经验在电机方面，而非医疗设备。此外，其实他接手的原型机根本不能用，比较像是依照伊莉莎白脑中想像所做成的实物大模型，他必须把这个模型变成一个可运转的设备。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A member of Theranos's board had recently approached him about taking over engineering at the startup. If he accepted the job, his task would be to turn the Theranos 1.0 prototype into a viable product the company could commercialize. After hearing Elizabeth's inspiring pitch, he decided to sign on.</div>

Tech startups stymied by a complex engineering problem called him and, more often than not, he found a solution.

<div class="line_en">Her obsession with miniaturization extended to the cartridge. She wanted it to fit in the palm of a hand, further complicating Ed's task. He and his team spent months reengineering it, but they never reached a point where they could reliably reproduce the same test results from the same blood samples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对「微小」的执着，延伸到卡匣上。她希望卡匣只有掌心大小，无疑更增加艾德蒙工作的复杂程度。艾德蒙和团队花了好几个月重新改造卡匣，但一直无法用同样的血液样本，得出相同的检测结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The main difficulty stemmed from Elizabeth's insistence that they use very little blood. She'd inherited from her mother a phobia of needles; Noel Holmes fainted at the mere sight of a syringe. Elizabeth wanted the Theranos technology to work with just a drop of blood pricked from the tip of a finger. She was so fixated on the idea that she got upset when an employee bought red Hershey's Kisses and put the Theranos logo on them for a company display at a job fair. The Hershey's Kisses were meant to represent drops of blood, but Elizabeth felt they were much too big to convey the tiny volumes she had in mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主要困难来自伊莉莎白坚持血液用量必须极少，她遗传了妈妈的「针头恐惧症」，诺儿．霍姆斯光是看到注射器就会昏倒。因此，伊莉莎白希望Theranos这套技术只需从指尖扎一滴血就好。她对此异常固执，有一次，一个员工买来红色的好时之吻（Hershey's Kisses）水滴巧克力，把公司标志放在巧克力上面，用于就业博览会的展示。此举令伊莉莎白大为光火，员工本意是借由水滴巧克力象征血滴，但伊莉莎白觉得巧克力太大，不符合她所想的少量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a complicated, interconnected system compressed into a small space. One of Ed's engineers had an analogy for it: it was like a web of rubber bands. Pulling on one would inevitably stretch several of the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一套压缩在一个小空间的复杂系统，牵一发而动全身。艾德蒙手下一位工程师有很好的模拟：这就好像橡皮筋编成的网络，只要拉其中一条必然会扯到其他好几条。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All these fluids needed to flow through the cartridge in a meticulously choreographed sequence, so the cartridge contained little valves that opened and shut at precise intervals. Ed and his engineers tinkered with the design and the timing of the valves and the speed at which the various fluids were pumped through the cartridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些液体必须依照计算周密、精心设计的顺序一一流过卡匣，所以卡匣里有几个小阀门，以固定的时间间隔开阖。而阀门设计、开阖时间，以及帮浦把各个液体打进卡匣的速度，都需要艾德蒙和工程师细心微调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Adding another level of complexity, blood and saline weren't the only fluids that had to flow through the cartridge. The reactions that occurred when the blood reached the little wells required chemicals known as reagents. Those were stored in separate chambers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another problem was preventing all those fluids from leaking and contaminating one another. They tried changing the shape, length, and orientation of the tiny channels in the cartridge to minimize the contamination. They ran countless tests with food coloring to see where the different colors went and where the contamination occurred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如何避免这些液体渗漏、相互污染也是个问题。他们尝试改变卡匣内小信道的形状、长度、方向，尽量把污染机率降到最低，然后用食用色素做了无数次测试，看看各种颜色的流向、污染发生于哪里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Each cartridge cost upward of two hundred dollars to make and could only be used once. They were testing hundreds of them a week. Elizabeth had purchased a $2 million automated packaging line in anticipation of the day they could start shipping them, but that day seemed far off. Having already blown through its first $6 million, Theranos had raised another $9 million in a second funding round to replenish its coffers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个卡匣的制造成本至少两百美元，而且只能用一次，一个星期要测试好几百个。伊莉莎白购买了一套要价两百万美元的自动包装生产线，期待有朝一日能开始出货，但那一天似乎遥遥无期。Theranos烧完第一轮募到的六百万美元后，第二轮又募到九百万美元补充空虚的金库。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The chemistry work was handled by a separate group made up of biochemists. The collaboration between that group and Ed's group was far from optimal. Both reported up to Elizabeth but weren't encouraged to communicate with each other. Elizabeth liked to keep information compartmentalized so that only she had the full picture of the system's development.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="化学作业是由另外一组生物化学家负责，这组人马和艾德蒙团队的合作，距离「理想」还十分遥远。两组各自直接向伊莉莎白报告，公司并不鼓励他们直接沟通。伊莉莎白喜欢把系统开发消息划分成各自独立、互不交流，这样一来，她就成了唯一知道全貌的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a result, Ed wasn't sure if the problems they were encountering were due to the microfluidics he was responsible for or the chemistry work he had nothing to do with. He knew one thing, though: they'd have a much better chance of success if Elizabeth allowed them to use more blood. But she wouldn't hear of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样做所造成的结果就是，艾德蒙碰到问题时无法确定是出在他负责的微流控技术，还是与他无关的化学部分。不过，有一点他倒是很清楚：如果伊莉莎白准许他们使用多一点血量，他们成功机率就会高上许多。只是伊莉莎白连听都不想听。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ed was working late one evening when Elizabeth came by his workspace. She was frustrated with the pace of their progress and wanted to run the engineering department twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to accelerate development. Ed thought that was a terrible idea. His team was working long hours as it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had noticed that employee turnover at the company was already high and that it wasn't confined to the rank and file. Top executives didn't seem to last long either. Henry Mosley, the chief financial officer, had disappeared one day. There was a rumor circulating around the office that he'd been caught embezzling funds. No one knew if there was any truth to it because his departure, like all the others, wasn't announced or explained. It made for an unnerving work environment: a colleague might be there one day and gone the next and you had no idea why.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was a high bar to set for herself, Ed thought. Then again, if there was anyone who could clear it, it might just be this young woman. Ed had never encountered anyone as driven and relentless. She slept four hours a night and popped chocolate-coated coffee beans throughout the day to inject herself with caffeine. He tried to tell her to get more sleep and to live a healthier lifestyle, but she brushed him off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可是很高的标准，艾德蒙心想。不过话说回来，如果真的有人办得到，很可能非这个年轻女孩莫属。艾德蒙从未碰过这么锲而不舍、坚持不懈的人，她一天只睡四个小时，整天不停地把咖啡豆巧克力往嘴里送，给自己注入满满的咖啡因。他曾劝她多睡一点、生活健康一点，但是她置若罔闻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ed didn't think she meant it to sound as callous as it did. But she was so laser focused on achieving her goals that she seemed oblivious to the practical implications of her decisions.

<div class="line_en">As obstinate as Elizabeth was, Ed knew there was one person who had her ear: a mysterious man named Sunny. Elizabeth had dropped his name enough times that Ed had gleaned some basic facts about him: he was Indian, he was older than Elizabeth, and they were a couple.

<div class="line_en">Sunny wasn't the only older man giving Elizabeth advice. She had brunch with Don Lucas every Sunday at his home in Atherton, the ultrawealthy enclave north of Palo Alto. Larry Ellison, whom she'd met through Lucas, was also an influence. Lucas and Ellison had both invested in Theranos's second funding round, which in Silicon Valley parlance was known as a "Series B" round. Ellison sometimes dropped by in his red Porsche to check on his investment. It wasn't uncommon to hear Elizabeth start a sentence with "Larry says."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑尼并非唯一提供意见给她的年长者，伊莉莎白每周日会到唐纳．卢卡斯位于阿瑟顿（Atherton，帕罗奥图北边的超级豪宅区）家中，共进早午餐。此外，她透过卢卡斯认识的赖瑞．艾利森，同样是能左右她的人。在Theranos第二轮募资——以硅谷用语来说是「B轮」（Series B），卢卡斯和艾利森都有投资。有时，艾利森会开着红色保时捷顺路过来看看他的投资，不时会听到她说：「赖瑞说…」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ellison might be one of the richest people in the world, with a net worth of some $25 billion, but he wasn't necessarily the ideal role model.

At the company Christmas party in a Palo Alto restaurant in late 2006, Elizabeth got too tipsy to go home on her own, so she called Sunny and asked him to come pick her up. That's when Ed learned that they were living together in a condo a few blocks away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ed didn't have time to dwell on it too much because there was something else he had to deal with: Elizabeth had convinced Pfizer to try out the Theranos system in a pilot project in Tennessee. Under the agreement, Theranos 1.0 units were going to be placed in people's homes and patients were going to test their blood with them every day. The results would be sent wirelessly to Theranos's office in California, where they would be analyzed and then forwarded to Pfizer. They had to somehow fix all the problems before the study started. She'd already scheduled a trip to Tennessee to begin training some of the patients and doctors in how to use the system.</div>

<div class="line_en">Amid the drama, the competition between engineering teams intensified. The new group competing with Ed's was headed by Tony Nugent. Tony was a gruff, no-nonsense Irishman who'd spent eleven years at Logitech, the maker of computer accessories, followed by a stint at a company called Cholestech that made a simpler version of what Theranos was trying to build.

<div class="line_en">Hewett's conviction when he'd arrived at Theranos was that microfluidics didn't work in blood diagnostics because the volumes were too small to allow for accurate measurements. But he hadn't had time to come up with much of an alternative. That job now fell to Tony.</div>
