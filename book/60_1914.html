<div class="line_en">He always tried to get her to stay in bed and let him have breakfast alone. She never gave in. Tomas was at work from seven to four, Tereza from four to midnight. If she were to miss breakfast with him, the only time they could actually talk together was on Sundays. That was why she got up when he did and then went back to bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">This morning, however, she was afraid of going back to sleep, because at ten she was due at the sauna on Zofin Island. The sauna, though coveted by the many, could accommodate only the few, and the only way to get in was by pull. Luckily, the cashier was the wife of a professor removed from the university after 1968 and the professor a friend of a former patient of Tomas's. Tomas told the patient, the patient told the professor, the professor told his wife, and Tereza had a ticket waiting for her once a week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这一天，她怕自己又睡着了，因为十点钟她要去苏菲岛的桑拿浴室。桑拿浴的爱好者很多，而浴室里位置很少，得走后门才进得去。幸好有一个被大学开除的教授，他妻子就在浴室任出纳，这个教授是托马斯以前的一个病人的朋友。托马斯于是托这个病人，病人又托这个教授，教授再托他妻子，就这样，特蕾莎终于每个星期有机会去洗一次桑拿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She walked there. She detested the trams constantly packed with people pushing into one another's hate-filled embraces, stepping on one another's feet, tearing off one another's coat buttons, and shouting insults.</div>

<div class="line_en">The women thus armed with umbrellas were both young and old, but the younger among them proved the more steeled warriors. Tereza recalled the days of the invasion and the girls in miniskirts carrying flags on long staffs. Theirs was a sexual vengeance: the Russian soldiers had been kept in enforced celibacy for several long years and must have felt they had landed on a planet invented by a science fiction writer, a planet of stunning women who paraded their scorn on beautiful long legs the likes of which had not been seen in Russia for the past five or six centuries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在用伞武装起来的女人中间，有年轻的，也有年老的，但年轻的通常都是些最勇猛的斗士。特蕾莎回想起入侵的那段日子。年轻姑娘身着迷你裙，走过来，走过去，举着国旗飘扬的长竿。这是对多年来被迫禁欲的俄国士兵的性侵犯。他们来到布拉格，恐怕以为来到了一个科幻小说家杜撰出来的星球上，这里净是美艳得令人难以置信的女人，她们以美丽的长腿为武器，表示蔑视，而这是整个俄国五六个世纪以来都不曾见过的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was drizzling. As people rushed along, they began opening umbrellas over their heads, and all at once the streets were crowded, too. Arched umbrella roofs collided with one another. The men were courteous, and when passing Tereza they held their umbrellas high over their heads and gave her room to go by. But the women would not yield; each looked straight ahead, waiting for the other woman to acknowledge her inferiority and step aside. The meeting of the umbrellas was a test of strength. At first Tereza gave way, but when she realized her courtesy was not being reciprocated, she started clutching her umbrella like the other women and ramming it forcefully against the oncoming umbrellas. No one ever said Sorry. For the most part no one said anything, though once or twice she did hear a Fat cow! or Fuck you!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天下着毛毛雨。行人脚步匆匆，撑着雨伞。突然，人行道上乱成一团，伞篷碰撞在一起。男人倒是不失礼貌，在路过特蕾莎身边时，高高举起伞给她让出地方。但是女人寸土不让。她们只顾盯着前方，脸色严峻，等着别人自认不如，乖乖让路。伞的遭遇战是力量的考验。一开始，特蕾莎总是避让，当她明白好心换不来好报，便死死抓紧伞柄，跟其他女人一样较劲。好几次，她的伞狠狠撞上迎面而来的一把伞，但是没有哪个女人会说声“对不起”。通常，大家都不吭声；但有两三次，她听到了“婊子”或者一声“狗屎”！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How she had admired them! And now these same women were bumping into her, meanly and spitefully. Instead of flags, they held umbrellas, but they held them with the same pride. They were ready to fight as obstinately against a foreign army as against an umbrella that refused to move out of their way.</div>
