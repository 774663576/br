<div class="line_en">October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud…</div>

<div class="line_en">As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, "… don't fulfill their requirements… half an inch, if that…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利咕叽咕叽地走在空无一人的走廊上，突然看见一个和他一样心事重重的人。格兰芬多城堡的幽灵，“差点没头的”尼克正忧郁地望着窗外，嘴里低声念叨着：“……不符合他们的条件……就差半寸，如果那……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hello, hello," said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好，你好。”差点没头的尼克吃了一惊，四下张望着。他长长的鬈发上扣着一顶很时髦的、插着羽毛的帽子，身上穿着一件长达膝盖的束腰外衣，上面镶着车轮状的皱领，掩盖住了他的脖子几乎被完全割断的事实。他像一缕轻烟一样似有若无，哈利可以透过他的身体眺望外面黑暗的天空和倾盆大雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You look troubled, young Potter," said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.</div>

You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right," said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得对，”哈利说，一边后退着离开洛丽丝夫人谴责的目光，可是已经来不及了。费尔奇和他这只讨厌的猫之间，大概有某种神秘的力量联系着。他突然从一条挂毯后面冲到哈利右边，呼哧呼哧喘着气，气疯了似的东张西望，寻找违反校规的人。他脑袋上扎着一条厚厚的格子花纹围巾，鼻子红得很不正常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Harry. "Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly --"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="差点没头的尼克深深吸了几口气，然后用平静多了的口吻说：“那么——你又为什么事发愁呢？我能帮得上忙吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'd better get out of here, Harry," said Nick quickly. "Filch isn't in a good mood -- he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你最好离开这里，哈利，”尼克赶紧说，“费尔奇情绪不好。他感冒了，还有几个三年级学生不小心把青蛙的脑浆抹在了第五地下教室的天花板上。他整整冲洗了一个上午，如果他看见你把泥水滴得到处都是……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喵——”哈利的脚脖子附近突然发出一声尖厉刺耳的叫声，淹没了他的话音。他低下头，看见两只像灯一样发亮的黄眼睛。是洛丽丝夫人，这只骨瘦如柴的灰猫受到看门人费尔奇的重用，在他与学生之间没完没了的战斗中充当他的副手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Filth!" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. "Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“脏东西！”他喊道，指着从哈利的魁地奇队服上滴下来的泥浆和脏水，眼睛鼓得怪吓人的，双下巴上的肉颤抖着。“到处都是脏东西，到处一团糟！告诉你吧，我受够了！波特，跟我走！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利以前从未进过费尔奇的办公室，大多数学生对这个地方避之惟恐不及。房间里昏暗肮脏，没有窗户，只有一盏孤零零的油灯从低矮的天花板上吊下来。空气里弥漫着一股淡淡的煎鱼气味。四周的墙边排着许多木头文件柜；从标签上看，哈利知道柜里收藏着费尔奇处罚过的每个学生的详细资料。弗雷德和乔治两个人就占了整整一个抽屉。在费尔奇书桌后面的墙上，挂着一套亮晶晶的绞链和手铐、脚镣之类的东西。大家都知道，费尔奇经常请求邓布利多允许他吊住学生的脚踝，把学生从天花板上倒挂下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮鬼是学校里专门闹恶作剧的鬼，整天嘻皮笑脸，在空中蹿来蹿去，惹是生非，制造灾难和不幸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不太喜欢皮皮鬼，但他不由得感激皮皮鬼这次闹得正是时候。但愿皮皮鬼不管做了什么（从声音昕，他这次似乎打碎了一个很大的东西），都能使费尔奇的注意力从哈利身上转移开去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利认为他大概应该等费尔奇回来，就在书桌边的一张被虫蛀坏的椅子上坐下了。桌子上除了他那张填了一半的表格，还有另外一件东西——一个鼓鼓囊囊的紫色信封，上面印着一些银色的字。哈利飞快地朝门口瞥了一眼，确信费尔奇还没有回来，便拿起信封，看了起来：快速念咒魔法入门函授课程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: "I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: "My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利觉得困惑，便打开信封，从里面抽出一扎羊皮纸，只见第一页上又印着一些银色的花体字：您觉得跟不上现代魔法世界的节拍吗？您发现自己在寻找借口不表演简单的魔法吗？你有没有因为蹩脚的魔杖技法而受人嘲笑？答案就在这里！快速念咒是一种万无一失、收效神速、简便易学的全新课程。已有成百上千的男女巫师从快速念咒中受益匪浅！托普山的讨人嫌女士这样写道：“我记不住咒语，我调制的魔药受到全家人的取笑！现在，经过一期快速念咒课程的学习，我已成为晚会上大家注意的中心，朋友们都向我讨要闪烁魔药的配方！”迪茨布里的惹祸精巫师说：“我妻子过去总是嘲笑我蹩脚的魔法，但是在你们神奇的快速念咒班里学习了一个月之后，我成功地将她变成了一头牦牛！谢谢你，快速念咒！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry was just reading "Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened. Filch was looking triumphant.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander.

<div class="line_en">Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very amusing," said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常有趣。”差点没头的尼克板着脸说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Welcome, Patrick," said Nick stiffly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“欢迎光临，帕特里克。”尼克态度生硬地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nick!" he roared. "How are you? Head still hanging in there?" He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“尼克！”他大声吼道，“你好吗？脑袋还挂在那儿吗？”他发出一阵粗野的狂笑，拍了拍差点没头的尼克的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Live 'uns!" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“活人！”帕特里克先生一眼看见了哈利、罗恩和赫敏，假装吃惊地高高跳起，结果脑袋又掉了下来（大家哄堂大笑）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't mind Nick!" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. "Still upset we won't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say -- look at the fellow --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别管尼克！”帕特里克先生的脑袋从地板上喊道，“他还为我们不让他参加猎手队而耿耿于怀呢！可是我想说——你们看看这家伙——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我已故的勋爵们、女士们和先生们，我怀着极大的悲痛……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!" said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请诸位注意了，现在我开始讲话！”差点没头的尼克大声说，迈大步走向讲台，来到一道冰冷的蓝色聚光灯下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后面的话便没人能听见了。帕特里克先生和无头猎手队的其他成员玩起了一种头顶曲棍球的游戏，众人都转身观看。差点没头的尼克徒劳地试图重新抓住观众，可是帕特里克先生的脑袋在一片欢呼声中从他身边飞过，他只好败下阵来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think," said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, "Nick's very -- frightening and -- er --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为，”哈利看到尼克意味深长的目光，慌忙说道，“尼克非常——吓人，而且——哦——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ha!" yelled Sir Patrick's head. "Bet he asked you to say that!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈哈！”帕特里克先生的脑袋嚷道，“我猜是他叫你这么说的吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又是那个声音，那个他曾在洛哈特办公室里听见过的冷冰冰的、杀气腾腾的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"… soo hungry… for so long…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“……饿坏了……好久好久了……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他踉跄着停下脚步，抓住石墙，全神贯注地听着，一边环顾四周，眯着眼睛在光线昏暗的过道里上上下下地寻找。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Listen!" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听！”哈利急迫地说，罗恩和赫敏呆住了，注视着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, what're you --?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，你怎么——？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away -- moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="声音越来越弱了。哈利可以肯定它在移动——向上移动。他盯着漆黑的天花板，心里突然产生了一种既恐惧又兴奋的感觉；它怎么可能向上移动呢？难道它是一个幽灵，石头砌成的天花板根本挡不住它？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pudding might not be finished yet," said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“布丁大概还没有吃完吧。”罗恩满怀希望地说，领头向通往门厅的台阶走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't stand much more of this," Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我再也受不住了。”罗恩嘟囔说，他的牙齿地打战。这时乐队又吱吱呀呀地开始演奏了，大鬼小鬼们飘飘然地回到舞常">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"… rip… tear… kill…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“……撕你……撕裂你……杀死你……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then Harry heard it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，哈利听见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们向门口移动，一边对每个看着他们的人点头微笑。一分钟后，他们就匆匆走在点着黑蜡烛的过道里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's that voice again -- shut up a minute --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个声音又出现了——先别说话——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's go," Harry agreed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们走吧。”哈利赞同道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，哈利已经很冷了，肚子更是饿得咕咕直叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This way," he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走这边。”他喊道，撒腿跑了起来，跑上楼梯，跑进门厅。这里回荡着礼堂里万圣节宴会的欢声笑语，不太可能听见其他动静。哈利全速奔上了大理石楼梯，来到二楼，罗恩和赫敏跌跌撞撞地跟在后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, what're we --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，我们在做什——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"SHH!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘘！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, what was that all about?" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. "I couldn't hear anything…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，这到底是怎么回事？”罗恩说，一边擦去脸上的汗珠。“我什么也听不见……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: "… I smell blood… I SMELL BLOOD!" His stomach lurched --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利竖起耳朵。远远地，从上面一层楼上，那个声音又传来了，而且变得越发微弱：“……我闻到了血腥味……我闻到了血腥味！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's going to kill someone!" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps -- Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的肚子猛地抽动起来。“它要杀人了！”他喊道，然后不顾罗恩和赫敏脸上困惑的表情，三步两步登上一层楼梯，一边在他沉重的脚步声中倾听着。哈利飞奔着把三楼转了个遍，罗恩和赫敏气喘吁吁地跟在后面，三个人马不停蹄，最后转过一个墙角，来到最后一条空荡荡的过道里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏突然倒抽一口冷气，指着走廊的下方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped -- there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash… Mrs. Norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们小心翼翼地靠近，哈利差点儿滑了一跤——地上有一大摊水。罗恩和赫敏一把抓住他，他们一点点儿地走近那条标语，眼睛死死盯着下面的一团黑影。三个人同时看清了那是什么，吓得向后一跳，溅起一片水花。是洛丽丝夫人，看门人的那只猫，尾巴挂在火把的支架上，身体僵硬得像块木板，眼睛睁得大大的，直勾勾地瞪着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's that thing -- hanging underneath?" said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是什么东西——挂在下面？”罗恩说，声音有些颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, "Let's get out of here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个人一动不动地站着，足有好几秒钟，然后罗恩说道：“我们赶快离开这里吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shouldn't we try and help --" Harry began awkwardly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是不是应该设法抢救——”哈利不很流利地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir, beware.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们面前的墙上，有什么东西在闪闪发亮。他们慢慢走近，眯着眼在黑暗中仔细辨认。在两扇窗户之间，距地面一尺高的墙面上，涂抹着一些字迹，在燃烧的火把的映照下闪着微光。密室被打开了。与继承人为敌者，警惕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而已经来不及了。一阵低沉的喧闹声，像远处的雷声一样，告诉他们宴会刚刚结束。从他们所处的走廊的两端，传来几百只脚登上楼梯的声音，以及人们茶足饭饱后愉快的高声谈笑。接着，学生们就推推挤挤地从两端拥进过道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Trust me," said Ron. "We don't want to be found here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听我说，”罗恩说，“我们可不想在这里被人发现。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“与继承人为敌者，警惕！下一个就是你，泥巴种！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then someone shouted through the quiet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这片寂静中，有人高声说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当前面的人看见那只倒挂的猫时，热热闹闹、叽叽喳喳的声音突然消失了。哈利、罗恩和赫敏孤零零地站在走廊中间，学生们一下子安静了，纷纷挤上前来看这可怕的一幕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是德拉科·马尔福。他已经挤到人群前面，冰冷的眼睛活泛了起来，平常毫无血色的脸涨得通红。他看着挂在那里的那只静止僵硬的猫，脸上露出了狞笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
