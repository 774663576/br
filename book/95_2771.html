<div class="line_en">My mom thought having a child was going to be like having a partner, but every child is born the center of its own universe, incapable of understanding the world beyond its own wants and needs, and I was no different. I was a voracious kid. I consumed boxes of books and wanted more, more, more. I ate like a pig. The way I ate I should have been obese. At a certain point the family thought I had worms. Whenever I went to my cousins' house for the holidays, my mom would drop me off with a bag of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes and a large sack of cornmeal. That was her way of preempting any complaints about my visit. At my gran's house I always got seconds, which none of the other kids got. My grandmother would give me the pot and say, "Finish it." If you didn't want to wash the dishes, you called Trevor. They called me the rubbish bin of the family. I ate and ate and ate.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was hyperactive, too. I craved constant stimulation and activity. When I walked down the sidewalk as a toddler, if you didn't have my arm in a death grip, I was off, running full-speed toward the traffic. I loved to be chased. I thought it was a game. The old grannies my mom hired to look after me while she was at work? I would leave them in tears. My mom would come home and they'd be crying. "I quit. I can't do this. Your son is a tyrant." It was the same with my schoolteachers, with Sunday school teachers. If you weren't engaging me, you were in trouble. I wasn't a shit to people. I wasn't whiny and spoiled. I had good manners. I was just high-energy and knew what I wanted to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还多动。我随时都在追求刺激，动个不停。当我在学走路的时候，走在马路上，如果你没有死命抓着我的胳膊，我就会挣脱你的手，向车流全速冲过去。我喜欢被人在后面追的感觉。我以为这是在玩儿游戏。我妈在工作的时候会雇一些老奶奶来照顾我，她们后来怎么样了？全被我弄哭了。我妈每每回到家，她们肯定在哭。“我不干了。我干不了这活儿。你儿子就是个暴君。”我的学校老师、主日学校老师，都有同样的感受。你不带我玩儿？那你麻烦大了。我并不是对人态度不好。我不会吵闹，也没有被宠坏。我很有礼貌。我只是精力太充沛，而且特别有主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mom used to take me to the park so she could run me to death to burn off the energy. She'd take a Frisbee and throw it, and I'd run and catch it and bring it back. Over and over and over. Sometimes she'd throw a tennis ball. Black people's dogs don't play fetch; you don't throw anything to a black person's dog unless it's food. So it was only when I started spending time in parks with white people and their pets that I realized my mom was training me like a dog.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anytime my extra energy wasn't burned off, it would find its way into general naughtiness and misbehavior. I prided myself on being the ultimate prankster. Every teacher at school used overhead projectors to put their notes up on the wall during class. One day I went around and took the magnifying glass out of every projector in every classroom. Another time I emptied a fire extinguisher into the school piano, because I knew we were going to have a performance at assembly the next day. The pianist sat down and played the first note and, foomp!, all this foam exploded out of the piano.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我还有多余的精力没有发泄完，那肯定得想尽办法去调皮捣蛋。我自诩为恶作剧之王，并引以为傲。上学的时候，老师会用投影机把大纲笔记投在墙上，而我有一天转了一大圈，去每个教室把每台投影机里头的放大镜镜头都取走了。还有一次，我拿了一只灭火器，把里面的东西倒进学校的钢琴里，因为我知道第二天我们会到这里集合看表演。演奏者坐下来，刚按下琴键，嘭！所有的泡沫都从钢琴里爆了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two things I loved most were fire and knives. I was endlessly fascinated by them. Knives were just cool. I collected them from pawnshops and garage sales: flick knives, butterfly knives, the Rambo knife, the Crocodile Dundee knife. Fire was the ultimate, though. I loved fire and I especially loved fireworks. We celebrated Guy Fawkes Day in November, and every year my mom would buy us a ton of fireworks, like a mini-arsenal. I realized that I could take the gunpowder out of all the fireworks and create one massive firework of my own. One afternoon I was doing precisely that, goofing around with my cousin and filling an empty plant pot with a huge pile of gunpowder, when I got distracted by some Black Cat firecrackers. The cool thing you could do with a Black Cat was, instead of lighting it to make it explode, you could break it in half and light it and it would turn into a mini-flamethrower. I stopped midway through building my gunpowder pile to play with the Black Cats and somehow dropped a match into the pile. The whole thing exploded, throwing a massive ball of flame up in my face. Mlungisi screamed, and my mom came running into the yard in a panic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我最喜欢的两样东西，一个是火，一个是刀。对这两样，我简直是如痴如醉。刀还好，我可以从当铺和庭院甩卖摊子上收集到各种刀：弹簧刀，蝴蝶刀，兰博猎刀，还有鳄鱼邓迪刀。但火简直是我的本命，我尤其喜欢烟火。11月的时候，我们会庆祝盖伊·福克斯日，每年到那时我妈都会买一大堆烟火，家里简直像购置了一个迷你军火库。我想到，我可以把所有烟火里的火药倒出来放到一块儿，自己做一个巨大的炮仗。有一天下午我真这么干了，我和表哥闲着无聊，把一大堆火药取出来塞进一个空花盆里，然后我的注意力被黑猫爆竹吸引了过去。黑猫爆竹的牛逼之处在于，它不仅仅是能点燃然后爆炸，你还能把它折成两半再点燃，它就能变成一个迷你的喷火器。我在做巨型炮仗的途中，忽然去玩了一会儿黑猫爆竹，不知怎么地，一根火柴落在了火药堆上。整堆火药炸了，一个巨大的火球直接腾空而起，飞到我脸上。穆隆格斯尖叫起来，我妈妈惊慌失措地跑到院子里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And I couldn't help it. There's a condition kids suffer from, a compulsive disorder that makes them do things they themselves don't understand. You can tell a child, "Whatever you do, don't draw on the wall. You can draw on this paper. You can draw in this book. You can draw on any surface you want. But do not draw or write or color on the wall." The child will look you dead in the eye and say, "Got it." Ten minutes later the child is drawing on the wall. You start screaming. "Why the hell are you drawing on the wall?!" The child looks at you, and he genuinely has no idea why he drew on the wall. As a kid, I remember having that feeling all the time. Every time I got punished, as my mom was whooping my ass, I'd be thinking, Why did I just do that? I knew not to do that. She told me not to do that. Then once the hiding was over I'd say to myself, I'm going to be so good from here on. I'm never ever going to do a bad thing in my life ever ever ever ever ever -- and to remember not to do anything bad, let me write something on the wall to remind myself… and then I would pick up a crayon and get straight back into it, and I never understood why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且我没法控制自己。孩子们总是为此烦恼，他们好像都有强迫症，强迫自己做不理解的事。你可以跟一个小孩说：“做什么都行，就是别往墙上乱画。你可以画在纸上，或者这本书上，你想在任何地方画都行，就是别往墙上乱写乱涂。”那小孩会呆滞地看着你，说：“明白了。”十分钟后，这个小孩就会画到墙上去。你开始对这小孩尖叫：“你为什么还往墙上画？！”小孩会望向你，他真的不知道为什么要往墙上画。作为小孩，我记得自己总是处于这样的迷茫之中。每次我被惩罚，一边被我妈打屁股，一边心里在纳闷，为什么我刚才要那样做啊？我知道不该那么做的。她让我别那么做的。挨完揍，我对自己说，从现在起我要好好表现。我一辈子都不要做坏事了，再也再也再也不做了——为了要把再也不做坏事记下来，我得把这句话写在墙上提醒自己…然后我会拿起一只蜡笔，直接往墙上开始写，我至今也不明白为什么自己会这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My mom was forever trying to rein me in. Over the years, her tactics grew more and more sophisticated. Where I had youth and energy on my side, she had cunning, and she figured out different ways to keep me in line. One Sunday we were at the shops and there was a big display of toffee apples. I loved toffee apples, and I kept nagging her the whole way through the shop. "Please can I have a toffee apple? Please can I have a toffee apple? Please can I have a toffee apple?

Sometimes my mom would catch me, but she was usually one step behind, and she was always giving me the eye. Someday, kid. Someday I'm going to catch you and put you away for the rest of your life. Then I would give her a nod in return. Have a good evening, Officer. That was my whole childhood.</div>

<div class="line_en">The flames moved quickly. Soon the roof was on fire, and from there the blaze spread to the main house, and the whole thing burned and burned and burned. Smoke was billowing into the sky. A neighbor had called the fire brigade, and the sirens were on their way. Me and this kid and the maid, we ran out to the road and watched as the firemen tried to put it out, but by the time they did, it was too late. There was nothing left but a charred brick-and-mortar shell, roof gone, and gutted from the inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">The white family came home and stood on the street, staring at the ruins of their house. They asked the maid what happened and she asked her son and the kid totally snitched. "Trevor had matches," he said. The family said nothing to me. I don't think they knew what to say. They were completely dumbfounded. They didn't call the police, didn't threaten to sue. What were they going to do, arrest a seven-year-old for arson? And we were so poor you couldn't actually sue us for anything. Plus they had insurance, so that was the end of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't feel bad about it at all. I still don't. The lawyer in me maintains that I am completely innocent. There were matches and there was a magnifying glass and there was a mattress and then, clearly, a series of unfortunate events. Things catch fire sometimes. That's why there's a fire brigade. But everyone in my family will tell you, "Trevor burned down a house." If people thought I was naughty before, after the fire I was notorious. One of my uncles stopped calling me Trevor. He called me "Terror" instead. "Don't leave that kid alone in your home," he'd say. "He'll burn it to the ground."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对这件事一点儿都不觉得愧疚，现在也不觉得。我心中的律师告诉我，我是无罪的。那儿有一盒火柴，一个放大镜，一个草垫，这是一系列不幸的偶然事件。有时候东西就是会着火。这也是为什么我们需要消防部门。如果人们以前觉得我只是淘气，在这场火灾之后，我变得臭名昭著。我的一个舅舅不再叫我特雷弗，他叫我“特雷”（意为“恐怖”）。他常说：“别把那孩子一个人留在你家，他会把房子烧没的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They kicked Abel out of the garage, which I thought was hilarious because the garage, which was freestanding, was the only piece of the property left unscathed. I saw no reason for Abel to have to leave, but they made him. We packed up his stuff, put it into our car, and drove home to Eden Park; Abel basically lived with us from then on. He and my mom got into a huge fight. "Your son has burned down my life!" But there was no punishment for me that day. My mom was too much in shock. There's naughty, and then there's burning down a white person's house. She didn't know what to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们把亚伯从车库里赶走了。我觉得这有点儿滑稽，因为车库和其他房子不挨着，是整个家唯一没有受到损伤的地方。亚伯其实没理由离开，但是他们赶走了亚伯。我们收拾了他的东西，放进车里，一起载回了伊登公园。从那时起，亚伯就和我们住在一起了。他和我妈大吵了一架：“你儿子烧毁了我的生活！”但那天我没有受罚，我妈太震惊了。淘气是一回事，而烧掉白人的房子是另一回事。她也不知道该怎么办。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My cousin Mlungisi, to this day, cannot comprehend how I survived being as naughty as I was for as long as I did, how I withstood the number of hidings that I got. Why did I keep misbehaving? How did I never learn my lesson? Both of my cousins were supergood kids. Mlungisi got maybe one hiding in his life. After that he said he never wanted to experience anything like it ever again, and from that day he always followed the rules. But I was blessed with another trait I inherited from my mother: her ability to forget the pain in life. I remember the thing that caused the trauma, but I don't hold on to the trauma. I never let the memory of something painful prevent me from trying something new. If you think too much about the ass-kicking your mom gave you, or the ass-kicking that life gave you, you'll stop pushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It's better to take it, spend some time crying, then wake up the next day and move on. You'll have a few bruises and they'll remind you of what happened and that's okay. But after a while the bruises fade, and they fade for a reason -- because now it's time to get up to some shit again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时至今日，我的表兄穆隆格斯依然无法理解，我怎么可以一直调皮捣蛋地活到今天的，我怎么能经得住那么多次暴揍，却一直不长记性。我的表兄弟都非常乖。穆隆格斯大概一辈子就挨过一次打，在那之后他说他再也不想挨打了，于是变得非常循规蹈矩。但是我还从我妈身上继承了一个特点，就是擅长忘记生活中的痛苦。我记得留下创伤的原因，但是我不会揪着创伤不放。我从来不会让回忆的痛苦阻碍我对新东西的尝试。如果你总是想着你妈妈会打你，或者生活会惩罚你，你就不会再突破界限，打破规则。最好的是，你挨完打，哭一会儿，第二天醒来继续生活。身上可能会留下几块淤青，提醒你发生了什么，但没事的，过一段时间，淤青会褪去，而且它们褪去是有原因的——又到了该干点儿什么坏事的时候了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was front-page news all over the country. White people lost their shit. Oh my word, it was insane. The security guard was arrested and put on trial and found guilty of animal abuse. He had to pay some enormous fine to avoid spending several months in jail. What was ironic to me was that white people had spent years seeing video of black people being beaten to death by other white people, but this one video of a black man kicking a cat, that's what sent them over the edge. Black people were just confused. They didn't see any problem with what the man did. They were like, "Obviously that cat was a witch. How else would a cat know how to get out onto a soccer pitch? Somebody sent it to jinx one of the teams. That man had to kill the cat. He was protecting the players."</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a famous incident during an Orlando Pirates soccer match a few years ago. A cat got into the stadium and ran through the crowd and out onto the pitch in the middle of the game. A security guard, seeing the cat, did what any sensible black person would do. He said to himself, "That cat is a witch." He caught the cat and -- live on TV -- he kicked it and stomped it and beat it to death with a sjambok, a hard leather whip.</div>
