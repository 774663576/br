<div class="line_en">Several hours passed. The dog-man was hungry again. Michael and Sophie decided to have lunch too. Sophie approached Calcifer with the frying pan.</div>

<div class="line_en">All the same, he bent his head. Sophie was just putting the pan on top of the curly green flames when Howl's voice rang out hoarsely from nowhere. "Brace yourself, Calcifer! She's found me!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie sucked a slightly burned finger and picked slices of bacon off her skirt with the other hand, staring at Calcifer. He was whipping from side to side of the fireplace. His blurred faces pulsed from deep blue to sky blue and then almost to white. One moment he had multiple orange eyes, and the next, rows of starry silver ones. She had never imagined anything like it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲吮着略略烫到的手指，以另一只手由裙上拣起一片片的熏肉，同时注视着卡西法。它在壁炉里左右晃动，影象模糊的脸由深蓝转为浅蓝，然后几近白色，一会儿有多橘色眼睛，下一刻又变成成排似的白色眼睛。她从未想过会有这样的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Calcifer sprang upright. The frying pan fell across Sophie's knees. "You'll have to wait!" Calcifer roared, flaming blindingly up the chimney. Almost at once he blurred into a dozen or so burning blue faces, as if he was being shaken violently about, and burned with a loud, throaty whirring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡西法一下跳起来，煎锅跌出来，掉在苏菲膝上。卡西法吼着，以令人目盲的狂焰冲上烟囱。几乎同时，它幻化为十几个然后的蓝脸，好象它被人猛烈晃动一样，并且发出巨大的、有喉音的呼呼声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael scrambled for the window. "They're quite near!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可匍匐着攀上窗子。“他们离得好近。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie hobbled to the window to. The storm of magic seemed to have affected half the things in the room. The skull was yattering its jaw so hard that it was traveling round in circles. Packets were jumping. Powder was seething in jars. A book dropped heavily out of the shelves and lay open on the floor, fanning its pages back and forth. At one end of the room, the scented steam boiled out of the bathroom: at the other, Howl's guitar made out-of-tune twangings. And Calcifer whipped about harder than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲也拐着走到窗边，魔法的风暴似乎影响到房里一半以上的事物。骷髅上下两排牙齿不停地打颤，整颗头颅绕着转圈：小包跳来跳去，瓶里的粉沸腾般地骚动着。一本书由架上重重掉下来，打了开来，在底墒自动前前后后的翻书。房子另一头，方向的蒸汽由浴室滚滚而出；另一头则有哈尔的吉他传出走调的丁冬声。卡西法转动得越发厉害了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something swept overhead with a blast and a boom which shook everything in the room. A second something followed, with a long, shrill roar. Calcifer pulsed nearly blue-black, and Sophie's skin fizzed with the backblast from the magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有东西由屋顶上掠过发出爆炸声，震动了整个房间。下一秒，另一样东西追过去，发出长长的，刺耳的吼叫。卡西法喘成蓝黑色，苏菲的皮肤因为感受到魔法的反作用力而发出嘶嘶声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael put the skull in the sink to stop it from yattering itself onto the floor while he opened the window and craned out. Whatever was happening was maddeningly just out of sight. People in the houses opposite were at doors and windows, pointing to something more or less overhead. Sophie and Michael ran to the broom cupboard, where they seized a velvet cloak each and flung them on. Sophie got the one that turned its wearer into a red-bearded man. Now she knew why Calcifer had laughed at her in the other one. Michael was a horse. But there was no time to laugh just then. Sophie dragged the door open and sped into the street, followed by the dog-man, who seemed surprisingly calm about the whole thing. Michael trotted out after her with a clatter of non-existent hooves, leaving Calcifer whipping from blue to white behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可把骷髅放到浴缸里，以免他打开窗户伸长脖子往外瞧时它会掉到地上，但是不管外面发生了什么，他们却看不见，这简直要叫人发狂！对街的人都挤在窗口和门口，指着上空某处。苏菲和麦可冲到储物柜，各拿了一件斗篷披上。苏菲拿到的是会将穿戴者变成红胡子男人的那件，现在她总算知道她穿另一件时卡西法为何会大笑了，麦可是一匹马。但当时实在没是笑，苏菲将门拉开，冲到街上，狗人紧跟在她后面，它对整件事的反应是令人惊讶的冷静。麦可则在她之后，以根本不存在的马蹄喀哒喀哒地小跑出来，独留卡西法在后头拼命挥动着，由蓝色转为白色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The street was full of people looking upward. No one had time to notice things like horses coming out of houses. Sophie and Michael looked too, and found a huge cloud boiling and twisting just above the chimney tops. It was black and rotating on itself violently. White flashes that were not quite like light stabbed through the murk of it. But almost as soon as Michael and Sophie arrived, the clot of magic took on the shape of a misty bundle of fighting snakes. Then it tore in two with a noise like an enormous cat fight. One part sped yowling across the roofs and out to sea, and the second went screaming after it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="街上挤满了仰头上望的人，没人有空去注意到‘马由房子里跑出来’这种事。麦可与苏菲随着众人的眼光看去，发现就在烟囱上头，有一大片云在沸腾、扭转。云是黑的，剧烈地自行扭转，看来不像是光线的白色闪光刺穿这片阴郁。但就在苏菲和麦可即将逃离城堡之时，这片魔法的块状物突然变成一群朦胧的、战斗的蛇，然后在发出一声像猫打架时的巨响后，一分为二。一部分嚎叫着、迅速越过屋顶往海上奔去，另一半则尖叫着追过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some people retreated indoors then. Sophie and Michael joined the rush of braver people down the sloping lanes to the dockside. There everyone seemed to think the best view was to be had along the curve of the harbor wall. Sophie hobbled to get out along it too, but there was no need to go beyond the shelter of the harbor master's hut. Two clouds were hanging in the air, some way out to sea, on the other side of the harbor wall, the only two clouds in the calm blue sky. It was quite easy to see them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些人退回屋里，苏菲跟麦可则加入那群较勇敢的人，走下倾斜的路到码头边去。每个人似乎都认定了港湾防波堤呈弧形的地方视线最好，苏菲也蹒跚地往那里走，但是其实走到港务长居住的小屋遮蔽处就可以了。空中有两股云，在海上，离港口有些距离，接近另一边的防波堤，平静的蓝天中就这么两团云高挂着，很容易就看到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was equally easy to see the dark patch of storm raging on the sea between the clouds, flinging up great, white-topped waves. There was an unfortunate ship caught in that storm. Its masts were beating back and forth. They could see spouts of water hitting it on all sides. The crew were desperately trying to take in the sails, but one at least had torn to flying gray rags.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也很容易看到两片云之间有黑色的风暴在海面上酝酿，激起滔天白浪。一艘倒霉的船不幸地陷身其中，船桅被打得前后晃动。人们可以看到浪不停地从四周打在船身。船上的水手拼命要收帆，但是至少有面帆已被撕成飞扬的灰色碎布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie put her face out into the wind beyond the hut, where the screaming came from, and discovered that the raging magic had disturbed more than the sea and the wretched ship. A number of wet, slithery-looking ladies with flying green-brown hair were dragging themselves up onto the harbor wall, screaming and holding long wet arms out to more screaming ladies tossing in the waves. Every one of them had a fishtail instead of legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲由小屋后面伸出头到风里探看，发现那狂暴的魔法惊扰到的不仅是海洋与船舶而已，许多身上湿漉漉、看起来滑溜溜、有飞扬的青褐色头发的女子。正奋力爬上防波堤，边尖叫着边伸出长长的、潮湿的手，帮那许多仍在浪里尖叫、沉浮的同伴上岸。每个女子都长着一条鱼尾巴，没有双腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can't they have a care for that ship!" someone said indignantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们难道不能放过那艘船吗？”有人愤愤不平地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the wind and the waves from the storm hit the harbor wall. White water lashed over and the brave persons out on the wall came crowding hurriedly back to the quayside, where the moored ships were heaving and grinding in their moorings. Among all this was a great deal of screaming in high, singing voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后由暴风雨卷其的风与浪突然打向防波堤，白浪冲过来，堤边勇敢的人群全匆忙地退到码头周遍，停泊在码头的船上下激烈地晃动。在一片动乱之中，夹杂着许多像是高昂歌唱声的尖叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Keep your mind on the Witch!" the horse beside Sophie yelled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小心女巫！”索菲旁边的马喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl was on the tossing, nearly sinking ship below. He was a tiny black figure, leaning against the bucking mainmast. He let the Witch know she had missed by waving at her cheekily. The Witch saw him the instant he waved. Cloud, Witch, and all at once became a savagely swooping red bird, diving at the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔人在下面那艘摆荡着，几乎要沉掉的船上面。他现在看来只是一个小小的黑色人形，他故意厚脸皮似地对女巫挥手，好让她知道她失手了。他手才举起来，女巫就看到了。云、女巫及一切迅即幻化成一只凶猛的红鸟，对着穿俯冲而下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Confound it!" said Sophie. "The mermaids from the curse!" that meant only two more impossible things to come true now.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked up at the two clouds. Howl was kneeling on the lefthand one, much larger and nearer than she would have expected. He was still dressed in black. Typically enough, he was staring over his shoulder at the frantic mermaids. He was not looking at them as if he remembered they were part of the curse at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她往上看那两朵云。哈尔跪在左边这一朵上面，比她预期中来得近、也来得大。他仍穿着黑衣，正回过头在看那些惊慌失措的美人鱼。但他的表情看来，完全不像记得她们是诅咒中的一部分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Witch sprang into being, standing on the righthand cloud, in a whirl of flame-colored robe and streaming red hair, with her arms raised to invoke further magic. As Howl turned and looked at her, her arms came down. Howl's cloud erupted into a fountain of rose-colored flame. Heat from it swept across the harbor, and the stones of the wall steamed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女巫现身站在右边的云上，穿一件火红的袍子，长长的红发飞扬着，双手高举要进一步召唤魔法。哈尔转过身看她时，她的双手正好扑下。哈尔的云爆出一股喷泉般、玫瑰色的火焰，产生的热气拖过港口，防波堤的石头随之冒出蒸汽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ship vanished. The mermaids sang a doleful scream. There was nothing but sulkily tossing water where the ship had been. But the huge diving bird was going too fast to stop. It plunged into the sea with a huge splash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船消失了，美人鱼唱出悲伤的尖叫。船原先所在的地方只剩海水闷闷地起伏荡漾，但是，俯冲的鸟冲得太快煞不住，直直冲下水去，激起高大的浪花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone on the quayside cheered. "I knew that wasn't a real ship really!" someone behind Sophie said.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had just reached the quay, and the boats in the harbor had all just rolled upright, when a second mountain of water rolled over the harbor wall. Out of its smooth side burst a monster. It was a long, black, clawed thing, half cat, half sea lion, and it came racing down the wall toward the quay. Another burst out of the wave as it smashed into the harbor, long and low too, but scalier, and came racing after the first monster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们才走到码头，港口的船全被打得竖立起来，第二股巨浪又以如山压顶的架势涌过防波堤。水波较平缓的一边跃出一只怪兽，长长黑黑的，长着爪子，半是猫，半是海狮，沿着防波堤朝码头奔来。浪击中港口时，另一只怪兽由浪中跳出来，也是长长的，长相粗野，但身上更多鳞片，在第一只怪物身后紧追不舍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As proof that the ship had been much nearer than it looked, the waves from the splash reached the harbor wall before Michael had stopped speaking. A twenty-foot green hill of water rode smoothly sideways across it, sweeping the screaming mermaids into the harbor, rolling every moored ship violently sideways, and thudding in swirls round the harbor master's hut. An arm came out of the side of the horse and hauled Sophie back toward the quay. Sophie gasped and stumbled in knee-high gray water. The dog-man bounded beside them, soaked to the ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实证明，那船原比它看起来还近。麦可都还没说完，鸟入水时激起的海浪就已来到防波堤。一个二十尺高的绿色水墙平滑地斜越过它，将尖叫的美人鱼扫进港口，将所有停泊在港里的船剧烈地扫向一边，涡流在港务长的小屋四周旋转着发出重击声。马身旁突然伸出一只手来，将苏菲往回拉，往码头方向走。苏菲喘着气，在及膝的灰水中踉跄涉行。狗人跟在他们身边跳跃前行，水都浸到它耳朵了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie fell over a rope and then a doorstep. The arm came out of the horse and dragged her upright as the two monsters streaked past in a scatter of salt water. Another wave swirled over the harbor wall, and two more monsters burst out of that. They were identical to the first two, except the scaly one was closer to the catlike one. And the next rolling wave brought two more, closer together yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲一路跌跌撞撞的，先是绊到绳子，然后绊到门阶，马伸出手，将她拉起来。两只怪兽奔驰而过，带起盐水横飞四溅。又一股巨浪涌过防波堤，又两只怪兽涌现，与前两只长得一模一样，只不过有鳞的那一只离像猫的一只较近。然后又是一股浪潮带来另外两只，两只间的距离又更近了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of the onlookers found the monsters too terrifying. Many went home. Others jumped down into the rolling ships to fend them off from the quay. Sophie and Michael joined the hard core of watchers who set off through the streets of Porthaven after the monsters. First they followed a river of sea water, then huge, wet paw prints, and finally white gouges and scratches where the claws of the creatures had dug into the stones of the street. These led everyone out the back of the town to the marshes where Sophie and Michael had chased the shooting star.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些看热闹的人大概觉得怪物太可怕，就回家了；有些为了避开码头，跳到摇荡的船上。苏菲和麦可加入那些死忠的看热闹者，沿着避难港的街道追下去。他们先是跟着一长条的海水走，然后是潮湿的巨大抓痕，最后是怪物的爪子在街道石头留下的白孔与抓痕，这些将他们引到避难港镇后的沼泽区，也就是苏菲和麦可追逐流星的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie and Michael waited until the very last, when it was clear that it was indeed all over. Then they turned slowly back into Porthaven. Neither of them felt like speaking. Only the dog-man seemed happy. He sauntered beside them so friskily that Sophie was sure he thought Howl was done for. He was so pleased with life that when they turned into the street where Howl's house was and there happened to be a stray cat crossing the road, the dog-man uttered a joyful bark and galloped after it. He chased it with a dash and a skitter straight to the castle doorstep, where it turned and glared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲和麦可一直等到最后，确定一切真的都结束了，才慢慢转身走会避难港。两人都不想说话，只有狗人看起来高兴不已，它在他们身边轻快漫步，苏菲确信那是因为它认为哈尔已经死了。因为对这个情况太满意了，当他们转到哈尔房子所在的街道，一只流浪猫正好在他们前面过街时，狗人愉快地吠了一声，放足追赶。它一路飞快地追，直将它追到城堡门口，猫突然转身瞪眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I reckon they must have done for one another," people said. The crowd gradually split into separate figures hurrying away to jobs they left half done.</div>

<div class="line_en">By this time all six creatures were bounding black dots, vanishing into the flat distance. The crowd spread out into a ragged line on the bank, staring, hoping for more, and afraid of what they might see. After a while no one could see anything but empty marsh. Nothing happened. Quite a few people were turning away to leave when of course everyone else shouted, "Look!" A ball of pale fire rolled lazily up in the distance. It must have been enormous. The bang that went with hit only reached the watchers when the fireball had become a spreading tower of smoke. The line of people all winced at the blunt thunder of it. They watched the smoke spread until it became part of the mist on the marshes. They went on watching after that. But there was simply peace and silence. The wind rattled the marsh weeds, and birds began to dare to cry again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，六只怪物已成为六个跳跃的黑点，在远方的平地消失。群众沿着堤岸分散开来，成不规则的一条线。极目四眺，希望还有更多好戏可看，同时又担心害怕着。好一会儿，除了空荡荡的沼泽之外，什么也看不到，什么也没发生。许多人已转身开始离去了，突然听到其他的人大叫：“看！”远处有颗苍白的火球缓缓升起，体积显然非常庞大，爆炸的声音一直到火球化为四处飘散的烟时，才传到看热闹者的耳朵，人们全被那巨大的声响震得直眨眼。他们一直看到那些烟散开来，成为沼泽雾气的一部分，仍继续等着，但剩下的唯有宁静和祥和。风吹响沼泽上的野草，鸟再度叫出声来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie opened the door and the cat crawled inside. The cat crawled to the hearth, where Calcifer was down to the merest blue flicker, and, with an effort, got its front paws up onto the chair seat. There it grew rather slowly into Howl, bent double.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie took off her cloak and found the brandy and a glass. Howl drank one glass off as if it were water. Then he poured out a second glass, and instead of drinking it, he dripped it carefully on Calcifer. Calcifer flared and sizzled and seemed to revive a little. Howl poured a third glass and lay back sipping it. "Don't stand staring at me!" he said. "I don't know who won. The Witch is mighty hard to come at. She relies mostly on her fire demon and stays behind out of trouble. But I think we gave her something to think about, eh, Calcifer?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲把斗篷脱掉，找到白兰地和杯子。哈尔一喝就是一杯，好象那是白开水一样，然后他又倒了一杯，但是并没有喝掉，而是小心地滴在卡西法身上。卡西法燃烧起来，发出嘶嘶声，似乎稍稍恢复了些。哈尔倒了第三杯，躺回椅子上慢慢啜饮，“别站在那里瞪着我瞧！”他说：“我不知道谁赢了。女巫非常难攻击，她大都倚赖她的火魔，自己躲在后面。不过我想我们是给了她一些颜色瞧瞧，够她好好想想的。对吧，卡西法？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Howl. He turned round and flopped into the chair, where he lay looking very tired indeed. "All that on top of a cold!" he croaked. "Sophie, for pity's sake take off that horrible red beard and find the bottle of brandy in the closet-unless you've drunk it or turned it into turpentine, of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，”哈尔回答。他转身，啪嗒一声沉到椅子里，就这样躺着，看起来非常疲倦的样子。“都感冒了还来这一场…”他哑声说：“苏菲，看在老天爷的份上，把你那可怕的红胡子脱掉，去柜子里给我找瓶白兰地——除非酒已被你喝掉，或变成松节油。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I did, you old fraud!" Howl said wearily. "You know everything I know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有呀，你少假了！”哈尔疲倦地说：“你知道我所知道的每一件事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's old," Calcifer said in a weak fizzle from under his logs. "I'm stronger, but it knows things I never thought of. She's had it a hundred years. And it's half killed me!" He fizzled a bit, then climbed further out of his logs to grumble, "You might have warned me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它比我老，”卡西法从木头下嘶嘶说话：“我比较强壮，但是它知道一些我从未想过的事，她已经拥有它一百年了，它几乎要了我半条命！”嘶嘶作响后，它稍稍爬高一些，抱怨道：“你早该告诉我的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl lay sipping brandy while Michael found bread and sausage for them to eat. Food revived them all, except perhaps the dog-man, who seemed subdued now Howl was back after all. Calcifer began to burn up and look his usual blue self.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔躺着喝白兰地时，麦可找出面包和香肠给大家吃。食物使大家都恢复了元气，只有狗人，因为哈尔平安归来，反而显得无精打采。卡西法开始燃烧起来，回复平常的蓝色模样">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right," said Howl. "You have a choice between Market Chipping or the Witch. Don't go and be difficult."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”哈尔说：“你只能在马克奇平跟女巫中选一个。这事由不得你挑剔！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This won't do!" Howl said. He hauled himself to his feet. "Look sharp, Michael. The Witch knows we're in Porthaven. We're not only going to have to move the castle and the Kingsbury entrance now. I shall have to transfer Calcifer to the house that goes with that hat shop."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行不通的！”哈尔突然站起来，说：“女巫知道我们在避难港。所以现在我们不仅要搬动城堡和金斯别利入口，还得把卡西法搬到和帽店一块买下来的那间房子里去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
