<div class="line_en">I just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading back to the girl by the fire. His face is swollen with bruises, there's a bloody bandage on one arm, and from the sound of his gait he's limping somewhat. I remember him shaking his head, telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies, when all along, all along he'd planned to throw himself into the thick of things. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had told him to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thank goodness, I had the foresight to belt myself in. I've rolled sideways off the fork and I'm facing the ground, held in place by the belt, one hand, and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag, braced against the trunk. There must have been some rustling when I tipped sideways, but the Careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Okay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies was tempting. But this… this other thing. This teaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us. No one from District 12 would think of doing such a thing! Career tributes are overly vicious, arrogant, better fed, but only because they're the Capitol's lapdogs. Universally, solidly hated by all but those from their own districts. I can imagine the things they're saying about him back home now. And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace?</div>

I remain in my awkward position, muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer, then hoist myself back onto my branch. I need to get down, to get going, but for a moment I lie there, digesting what I've heard. Not only is Peeta with the Careers, he's helping them find me.

<div class="line_en">I'm about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe it's imprudent to check them with the others so close. But I have to. Too many years of hunting, I guess. And the lure of possible meat. I'm rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time, I've cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, and innards, under a pile of leaves. I'm wishing for a fire -- eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned the hard way -- when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry back to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still hot. I cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over the coals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚要出发，却想起了我下的套。也许在其他人如此靠近时查看猎物很不明智，但也许是多年的打猎形成的习惯，也许是肉的诱惑迫使我必须去看一看。我发现真的捕到了一只挺不错的兔子。不一会儿，我剥了兔皮，清理了内脏，把兔头、兔脚、兔皮和内脏埋在一堆树叶下面。我真想有一堆火，因为吃生兔肉会让人生病。但一想起死掉的“贡品”，她的教训，我还是决定放弃。我赶紧跑到她点的火堆旁边。不错，火堆的余烬仍然是热的。我切开兔肉，把它穿在树枝上，放在即将熄灭的火堆上烤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Move," I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my sleeping bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take a deep breath. While I've been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches, it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be tracking me now though. The minute I hit the ground, I'm guaranteed a close-up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快走。”我轻声对自己说。我从睡袋里爬出来，把它卷好，放在背包里。我深吸了一口气。夜色、睡袋和柳枝给了我很好的掩护，所以摄像机肯定很难捕捉到我的清晰图像，此时他们一定在追踪我。我跳到地上的那一瞬间，肯定会给我一个特写镜头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我从浓密的树枝里爬出来，跳到地上。此时天已破晓。我有意短暂停留一下，好让镜头捕捉到我的清晰图像。我把头微微昂起，扭向一边，然后会心一笑。嘿！让他们好好猜猜我到底是什么意思吧！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with them.

<div class="line_en">I pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the coals, and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went.

<div class="line_en">As I hike along, I feel certain I'm still holding the screen in the Capitol, so I'm careful to continue to hide my emotions. But what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having with his guest commentators, dissecting Peeta's behavior, my reaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed his true colors? How does this affect the betting odds? Will we lose sponsors? Do we even have sponsors? Yes, I feel certain we do, or at least did.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I can hunt, that I'm a good bet because I won't be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger. While the rabbit cooks, I grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack. The black tones it down, but I feel a layer of mud would definitely help. Of course, to have mud, I'd need water…</div>

It's only been a day and I'm dehydrating fast. I try and think of everything I know about finding water. It runs downhill, so, in fact, continuing down into this valley isn't a bad thing. If I could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation, these might help me along. But nothing seems to change. There's just the slight gradual slope, the birds, the sameness to the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's late afternoon when I think I've found help. I spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, to suck the sweet juices from the skins. But just as I'm holding them to my lips, I get a hard look at them. What I thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape, and when I break one open the insides are bloodred. I don't recognize these berries, perhaps they are edible, but I'm guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the Gamemakers. Even the plant instructor in the Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100 percent sure they weren't toxic. Something I already knew, but I'm so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away.</div>

But as far as I can see in any direction, there's the same unrelenting stretch of forest.</div>

He's made that clear enough. But enough to let me die? From this? He can't do that, can he? If a mentor mistreats his tributes, he'll be held accountable by the viewers, by the people back in District 12. Even Haymitch wouldn't risk that, would he? Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hob, but I don't think they'd welcome him back there if he let me die this way. And then where would he get his liquor? So… what? Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him? Is he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta? Is he just too drunk to even notice what's going on at the moment? Somehow I don't believe that and I don't believe he's trying to kill me off by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own unpleasant way, genuinely been trying to prepare me for this.

<div class="line_en">Haymitch! He could send me water! Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes. I know I must have sponsors, at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me. Yes, it's pricey, but these people, they're made of money. And they'll be betting on me as well. Perhaps Haymitch doesn't realize how deep my need is.</div>

<div class="line_en">I bury my face in my hands. There's no danger of tears now, I couldn't produce one to save my life. What is Haymitch doing? Despite my anger, hatred, and suspicions, a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把脸埋在手里。现在已毋庸担心流泪，我连救命的一滴泪水都挤不出来。黑密斯究竟在干什么？尽管我对他又恨又气、又疑，可我似乎听到自己脑子里有个小声音对我说出了答案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe he's sending you a message, it says. A message. Saying what? Then I know. There's only one good reason Haymitch could be withholding water from me. Because he knows I've almost found it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My backpack seems to have tripled in weight. I find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and I start off. The sun's beating down, even more searing than the first two days. I feel like an old piece of leather, drying and cracking in the heat. Every step is an effort, but I refuse to stop. I refuse to sit down. If I sit, there's a good chance I won't be able to get up again, that I won't even remember my task.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我咬牙挺起身子，身上的背包好像比原来重了两倍。我找到一截断枝当做拐杖，继续前行。太阳火辣辣的，比前两天更热。我觉得自己就像一块破旧的皮革，在灼热的阳光下正焦干、爆裂。每走一步都非常艰难，但我决不会停下，我也不能坐下，如果坐下，极有可能就再也站不起来了，甚至有可能连自己要干什么都不知道了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What easy prey I am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, could take me right now, merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife, and I'd have little strength to resist. But if anyone is in my part of the woods, they ignore me. The truth is, I feel a million miles from another living soul.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，”我想，“这里还不赖。”空气已经不那么热了，预示着夜晚即将来临。飘来的一股香味让我想起了百合花。我的指头触摸着光滑的地面，在上面轻轻地画着。“这是一个为死而备的挺不错的地方。”我想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, easy now, I tell myself. I take one swallow and make myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple of hours, I drink the entire half gallon. Then a second. I prepare another before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping, eating rabbit, and even indulge in one of my precious crackers. By the time the anthem plays, I feel remarkably better. There are no faces tonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow I'll stay here, resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, catching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped, digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal. I snuggle down in my sleeping bag, hanging on to my water bottle for dear life, which, of course, it is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来半个小时的等待太痛苦了，可我硬是坚持下来。至少，我认为已经到了半个小时，这也是我能忍耐的最大限度。慢慢喝！放松！我对自己说。我喝了一口，然后等待。然后又喝一口。在随后的几个小时里，我喝光了水壶里的半加仑水。然后又灌了一瓶，我要在隐人树林之前再准备一瓶，在那儿，我可以边小口喝水，边吃兔肉，甚至可以享受一下，吃一块宝贵的饼干。国歌奏响时，我感觉好多了。今晚没有什么人的头像，今天无人死去。明天，我会待在这里，休整一下，用泥巴为背包做好伪装，抓些我喝水时在池塘里看到的小鱼，挖出池塘里的百合根好好地犒劳自己一番。我蜷缩在睡袋里，紧抱着给我生命的水，是啊，它救了我的命！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself toward the scent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond. Floating on the top, yellow flowers in bloom, are my beautiful lilies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我爬着，拖着身子，朝着有香味的地方爬去。在离我摔倒五码远的地方，有一小丛植物，我爬过去，找到了水塘。在池塘的水面上，漂浮着一朵朵盛开的黄花，那是百合，我美丽的百合！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as I can hold. But I have just enough sense left to abstain. With trembling hands, I get out my flask and fill it with water. I add what I remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is agony, but I do it. At least, I think it's a half an hour, but it's certainly as long as I can stand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我真想把头浸在水里，大口大口、尽情地喝池塘中的水，直到我再也喝不下去为止，但我不能。我用所剩的最后一点清醒意识告诉自己不要喝。我的手颤抖着，拿出水瓶来灌满水，然后在里面加入适量碘酒把水净化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool, slippery earth. I love mud, I think. How many times I've tracked game with the help of its soft, readable surface.
