<div class="line_en">Ted was in his third year in pre-med, his choice, he told me, ever since he dissected a fetal pig in the sixth grade.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ted and I met in a politics of ecology class when he leaned over and offered to pay me two dollars for the last week's notes. I refused the money and accepted a cup of coffee instead. This was during my second semester at UC Berkeley, where I had enrolled as a liberal arts major and later changed to fine arts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和特德，是在一次生态学的讲座中相识的。那天，他俯身递给我两块钱，以此作为报酬，来借我上星期做的笔记。我谢绝了他的两块钱却接受了他喝杯咖啡的邀请。那正是我在伯克莱大学的第二学期。我先入伯克莱的文科班，再转到美术系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And even though I know it's hopeless -- there's absolutely nothing left to save -- I'm afraid if I tell her that, she'll still persuade me to try.</div>

<div class="line_en">I think it's ironic that my mother wants me to fight the divorce. Seventeen years ago she was chagrined when I started dating Ted. My older sisters had dated only Chinese boys from church before getting married.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have to admit that what I initially found attractive in Ted were precisely the things that made him different from my brothers and the Chinese boys I had dated: his brashness; the assuredness in which he asked for things and expected to get them; his opinionated manner; his angular face and lanky body; the thickness of his arms; the fact that his parents immigrated from Tarrytown, New York, not Tientsin, China.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不讳言；特德最初能引起我注意的，恰恰就是那些与我的哥哥和相识的中国男孩子们的不同之处：他的鲁莽，他的执著，他的自信与固执己见；他的瘦削的轮廓分明的脸庞和颀长的身材，他的壮实的手臂；还有，他的父母是来自纽约泰兰城而不是中国的天津。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="后来，当特德和他父亲及其他客人走开去打排球时、他母亲便挽起我手臂，开始在草坪上踱步，渐渐地，我们踱出了人群。她亲热地握着我的手，眼睛却不对着我看：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Jordan also had a few words to say. Ted had casually invited me to a family picnic, the annual clan reunion held by the polo fields in Golden Gate Park. Although we had dated only a few times in the last month -- and certainly had never slept together, since both of us lived at home -- Ted introduced me to all his relatives as his girlfriend, which, until then, I didn't know I was.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Ted drove me home that day, I told him I couldn't see him anymore. When he asked me why, I shrugged. When he pressed me, I told him what his mother had said, verbatim, without comment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来在特德开车送我回家途中，我对他说：我们不要再见面了。他追问我原因，我便把他妈的那番话一字不改地重复给他听，没有加进任何我的评价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mrs. Jordan, I am not Vietnamese," I said softly, even though I was on the verge of shouting. "And I have no intention of marrying your son."</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she spoke quietly about Ted's future, his need to concentrate on his medical studies, why it would be years before he could even think about marriage. She assured me she had nothing whatsoever against minorities; she and her husband, who owned a chain of office-supply stores, personally knew many fine people who were Oriental, Spanish, and even black. But Ted was going to be in one of those professions where he would be judged by a different standard, by patients and other doctors who might not be as understanding as the Jordans were. She said it was so unfortunate the way the rest of the world was, how unpopular the Vietnam War was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，她娓娓地与我提及了有关特德的前程。他需要致力于他的医学深造，所以，这就是为什么，他不能过早考虑成家。她向我保证，她对少数民族，一丁点都没有任何偏见。她与他丈夫拥有好几爿办公用具公司，他们对公司里的一些东方人、西班牙人甚至黑人，印象都很好，私交也不错。但是特德将来所持的专业，注定有其特定的局限与准则，他的活动范围将是病人和其他医生们，他们不可能像我们乔顿家那般通情达理，那般理解特德。然后，她不无遗憾地表示，世上其他地方还有那么多灾难和不幸，越南战争，又是如此丧尽人心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you're just going to sit there! Let my mother decide what's right?" he shouted, as if I were a co-conspirator who had turned traitor. I was touched that Ted was so upset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行了，你就坐那边去，让我母亲来摆布一切吧。”他对着我大声咆哮着，好像我是他母亲的同谋者，好似我背叛了他。他的暴跳如雷和愤慨深深地打动了我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What should we do?" I continued to ask him. And within a year of our first meeting we were living together. The month before Ted started medical school at UCSF we were married in the Episcopal church, and Mrs. Jordan sat in the front pew, crying as was expected of the groom's mother. When Ted finished his residency in dermatology, we bought a run-down three-story Victorian with a large garden in Ashbury Heights. Ted helped me set up a studio downstairs so I could take in work as a free-lance production assistant for graphic artists.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们该怎么办？”我继续不断向他询问。就在我们相识的这一年内，我们住在一起了。在特德进入加州大学医科的前一个月，我们在圣公会教堂举行了婚礼。婚礼那天，乔顿大大坐在教堂前排长凳上哭了，就像一切新郎的母亲在这个时刻都会做的，哭得恰如其分。直到特德结束了他的皮肤病学实习，我们便买下一幢多年失修的，带个大花园的三层楼维多利亚式住宅。特德替我在楼下安排了个工作室，这样，我能作个自由绘图员，把活带到家里来做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What should we do?" I asked, and I had a pained feeling I thought was the beginning of love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那……我们该怎么办呢？”我幽幽地对他发问，同时觉得心口一阵作痛，我想，那是爱情的萌发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In those early months, we clung to each other with a rather silly desperation, because, in spite of anything my mother or Mrs. Jordan could say, there was nothing that really prevented us from seeing one another. With imagined tragedy hovering over us, we became inseparable, two halves creating the whole: yin and yang. I was victim to his hero. I was always in danger and he was always rescuing me. I would fall and he would lift me up. It was exhilarating and draining. The emotional effect of saving and being saved was addicting to both of us. And that, as much as anything we ever did in bed, was how we made love to each other: conjoined where my weaknesses needed protection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初的几个月里，我们如胶似漆，一种受唐突的反叛和冒险心理的激励，我们互相缠在一起，越发觉得彼此难以分离。我们自认对方，就是自己的那一半，我们两个一半，构成个坚固的整体，就像阴阳和合一样协调完美。我们是自己想象中一出悲剧的男女主角，他是搭救我的勇士，我只是个孱弱的女子。不论我陷于怎样的困境，我的勇敢的男主角，总会排除万难，就像童话中的王子历经曲折去解救受难的公主一样，将我搭救出来。我们完全沉醉在其间，情意缠绵。即使拥抱做爱之时，我也从心灵深处感到，我得到了保护，得到了依傍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But last year Ted's feelings about what he called "decision and responsibility" changed. A new patient had come to him asking what she could do about the spidery veins on her cheeks. And when he told her he could suck the red veins out and make her beautiful again, she believed him. But instead, he accidentally sucked a nerve out, and the left side of her smile fell down and she sued him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但从去年，特德变了。自从他接受了一个面颊上患蜘网血管瘤的女病人后，他的自信和责任感，都消遁了。他当时表示，他能把这些网状血管吸出来，令她恢复正常的形象。但结果，他竟把她面颊上的一根神经吸了出来，她左边的脸神经瘫痪了，她去法院控告了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After he lost the malpractice lawsuit -- his first, and a big shock to him I now realize -- he started pushing me to make decisons. Did I think we should buy an American car or a Japanese car? Should we change from whole-life to term insurance? What did I think about that candidate who supported the contras? What about a family?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诉讼失败后，他的变化令我震惊。他开始逼迫我来作决定。我得决定，是买美国车还是日本车，办终身保险还是定期保险？还有对候选人的选择，家庭的开支……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the years, Ted decided where we went on vacation. He decided what new furniture we should buy. He decided we should wait until we moved into a better neighborhood before having children. We used to discuss some of these matters, but we both knew the question would boil down to my saying, "Ted, you decide." After a while, there were no more discussions. Ted simply decided. And I never thought of objecting. I preferred to ignore the world around me, obsessing only over what was in front of me: my T-square, my X-acto knife, my blue pencil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好几年过去了，总是特德来决定，我们去哪度假，他决定需添哪些家具，他决定我们暂时不要小孩，直到搬到一个拥有更高层次的邻居的地段。开初时，我们还互相讨论一番，待我们明白讨论的结果，总不外乎是“你看着办吧，特德”，“你决定吧，特德”，便干脆不作讨论，只由特德做主了。我从没想过要违抗他的决定。我宁可不操这份闲心，集中精力在自己的T字尺和红蓝铅笔上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought about things, the pros and the cons. But in the end I would be so confused, because I never believed there was ever any one right answer, yet there were many wrong ones. So whenever I said, "You decide," or "I don't care," or "Either way is fine with me," Ted would say in his impatient voice, "No, you decide. You can't have it both ways, none of the responsibility, none of the blame."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我得反复掂量，反复考虑，而结果往往是我的脑袋被搅成一团浆糊。因此，只要我一说：“你决定吧”，或者“我无所谓”，“随你便，特德”，他便会不耐烦地说：“不，你来决定。你不可以这样毫无责任心，这样模棱两可。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And later, I discovered that maybe it was fate all along, that faith was just an illusion that somehow you're in control.

<div class="line_en">We had gone to the beach, to a secluded spot south of the city near Devil's Slide. My father had read in Sunset magazine that this was a good place to catch ocean perch. And although my father was not a fisherman but a pharmacist's assistant who had once been a doctor in China, he believed in his nengkan, his ability to do anything he put his mind to. My mother believed she had nengkan to cook anything my father had a mind to catch. It was this belief in their nengkan that had brought my parents to America. It had enabled them to have seven children and buy a house in the Sunset district with very little money. It had given them the confidence to believe their luck would never run out, that God was on their side, that the house gods had only benevolent things to report and our ancestors were pleased, that lifetime warranties meant our lucky streak would never break, that all the elements were in balance, the right amount of wind and water.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind was whipping the cotton trousers around my legs and I looked for some place where the sand wouldn't kick into my eyes. I saw we were standing in the hollow of a cove. It was like a giant bowl, cracked in half, the other half washed out to sea. My mother walked toward the right, where the beach was clean, and we all followed. On this side, the wall of the cove curved around and protected the beach from both the rough surf and the wind. And along this wall, in its shadow, was a reef ledge that started at the edge of the beach and continued out past the cove where the waters became rough. It seemed as though a person could walk out to sea on this reef, although it looked very rocky and slippery. On the other side of the cove, the wall was more jagged, eaten away by the water. It was pitted with crevices, so when the waves crashed against the wall, the water spewed out of these holes like white gulleys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风猛抽着我的裤管，沙砾刮得我睁不开眼睛。我发现我们站在一片洼地上，它就像个巨大的裂成两半的碗，一半在岸上，还有一半，倾覆在海里。我正想寻一块避风的地方。只见妈向右拐去，我们也就跟过去，发现那边的沙滩比较安静，也干净一点。沿着海湾，筑起一道弧形的围墙，以保护海滩不被海浪和海风损害。沿墙投向海面的阴影下，是一片礁石，由岸边笔直延伸出去，接连成长长的一片。那边的浪花显得特别汹涌，堆叠出朵朵白花。表面看上去，礁石平整光滑，好似可以让人在上面踱步走出海面。海湾的那边，围墙是锯齿形的，几乎全被海水浸没，墙面嶙峋凹凸，当大股的海浪猛扑冲撞过去，滚滚的白沫，便哗哗地从堤坝的裂缝处倾喷而下，就像股股白色的喷泉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So there we were, the nine of us: my father, my mother, my two sisters, four brothers, and myself, so confident as we walked along our first beach. We marched in single file across the cool gray sand, from oldest to youngest. I was in the middle, fourteen years old. We would have made quite a sight, if anyone else had been watching, nine pairs of bare feet trudging, nine pairs of shoes in hand, nine black-haired heads turned toward the water to watch the waves tumbling in.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother spread out an old striped bedspread, which flapped in the wind until nine pairs of shoes weighed it down. My father assembled his long bamboo fishing pole, a pole he had made with his own two hands, remembering its design from his childhood in China. And we children sat huddled shoulder to shoulder on the blanket, reaching into the grocery sack full of bologna sandwiches, which we hungrily ate salted with sand from our fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈拿出条子旧被单，费劲地用九双鞋子把它四边压住。这时，爸已装好他的竹鱼竿，那鱼竿还是他自己动手做的。我们则挤坐在被单上，一个劲往食品篮里掏三明治。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thinking back, I remember that this beach cove was a terrible place, full of wet shadows that chilled us and invisible specks that flew into our eyes and made it hard for us to see the dangers.

<div class="line_en">Then my father stood up and admired his fishing pole, its grace, its strength. Satisfied, he picked up his shoes and walked to the edge of the beach and then onto the reef to the point just before it was wet. My two older sisters, Janice and Ruth, jumped up from the blanket and slapped their thighs to get the sand off. Then they slapped each other's back and raced off down the beach shrieking. I was about to get up and chase them, but my mother nodded toward my four brothers and reminded me: "Dangsying tamende shenti," which means "Take care of them," or literally, "Watch out for their bodies." These bodies were the anchors of my life: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Bing. I fell back onto the sand, groaning as my throat grew tight, as I made the same lament: "Why?" Why did I have to care for them?</div>

<div class="line_en">So Bing wandered down the beach, walking stiffly like an ousted emperor, picking up shards of rock and chunks of driftwood and flinging them with all his might into the surf. I trailed behind, imagining tidal waves and wondering what I would do if one appeared. I called to Bing every now and then, "Don't go too close to the water. You'll get your feet wet." And I thought how much I seemed like my mother, always worried beyond reason inside, but at the same time talking about the danger as if it were less than it really was. The worry surrounded me, like the wall of the cove, and it made me feel everything had been considered and was now safe.</div>

She held in her hand the white Bible. And looking out over the water, she called to God, her small voice carried up by the gulls to heaven. It began with "Dear God" and ended with "Amen," and in between she spoke in Chinese.</div>

And I too saw Bing trudging wearily at the far end of the beach, his shoes hanging in his hand, his dark head bent over in exhaustion. I could feel what my mother felt. The hunger in our hearts was instantly filled. And then the two of us, before we could even get to our feet, saw him light a cigarette, grow tall, and become a stranger.</div>
