<div class="line_en">The fact that the gyptians had heard or seen nothing of Mrs. Coulter worried Farder Coram and John Faa more than they let Lyra know; but they weren't to know that she was worried too. Lyra feared Mrs. Coulter and thought about her often. And whereas Lord Asriel was now "father," Mrs. Coulter was never "mother." The reason for that was Mrs. Coulter's daemon, the golden monkey, who had filled Pantalaimon with a powerful loathing, and who, Lyra felt, had pried into her secrets, and particularly that of the alethiometer.</div>

<div class="line_en">And they were bound to be chasing her; it was silly to think otherwise. The spy-fly proved that, if nothing else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，他们一定正在追赶自己——傻瓜才不这么想呢，至少，那只间谍飞虫就证明了这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when an enemy did strike, it wasn't Mrs. Coulter. The gyptians had planned to stop and rest their dogs, repair a couple of sledges, and get all their weapons into shape for the assault on Bolvangar. John Faa hoped that Lee Scoresby might find some ground gas to fill his smaller balloon (for he had two, apparently) and go up to spy out the land. However, the aeronaut attended to the condition of the weather as closely as a sailor, and he said there was going to be a fog; and sure enough, as soon as they stopped, a thick mist descended. Lee Scoresby knew he'd see nothing from the sky, so he had to content himself with checking his equipment, though it was all in meticulous order. Then, with no warning at all, a volley of arrows flew out of the dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，当有敌人真的袭来的时候，这股敌人却不是库尔特夫人。吉卜赛人原来打算停下来，让狗休息一下，把几个雪橇修理修理，把所有的武器检查一遍，做好袭击伯尔凡加的准备。约翰·法阿希望李·斯科尔斯比能找到地面气体，把他小一点儿的那个气球充足气（他显然有两个气球），到天上去侦查一下这块地域。但是，气球驾驶员跟水手一样，非常关心天气状况，他说要有雾了。的确，等他们一停下来，便下起了浓雾。李·斯科尔斯比知道，在这样的天气里，自己从天上是什么也看不到的，因此，他只好细心地检查他的装备，尽管它们已经全部非常整齐了。就在这时，没有任何预兆，一排羽箭便从暗处飞了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first to come to his wits was John Faa, who shouted orders from the center of the line. Cold hands and stiff limbs moved to obey as yet more arrows flew down like rain, straight rods of rain tipped with death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个反应过来的是约翰·法阿。他站在那排雪橇的中间大声命令着。按照他的命令，人们冰冷的手和僵直的四肢开始行动起来。然而，更多的箭雨密集地飞落下来——笔直的、致命的箭雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three gyptian men went down at once, and died so silently that no one heard a thing. Only when they slumped clumsily across the dog traces or lay unexpectedly still did the nearest men notice what was happening, and then it was already too late, because more arrows were flying at them. Some men looked up, puzzled by the fast irregular knocking sounds that came from up and down the line as arrows hurtled into wood or frozen canvas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个吉卜赛人马上被射倒，一声不响地死了，谁都没听到一点儿声音。只是当他们突然笨重地摔倒在狗跑过的痕迹上，或者令人意想不到地静静地躺着的时候，离他们最近的人才注意到发生了什么事情。但这时已经太晚了，因为又有一排羽箭朝他们射了过来。有人抬头望去，看到那些箭猛地扎进那排木头或冻得硬邦邦的帆布里面，发出短促的没有规律的碰撞声，他们还觉得有点儿困惑不解，不知道这是什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lyra was in the open, and the arrows were passing over her head. Pantalaimon heard before she did, and became a leopard and knocked her over, making her less of a target. Brushing snow out of her eyes, she rolled over to try and see what was happening, for the semidarkness seemed to be overflowing with confusion and noise. She heard a mighty roar, and the clang and scrape of lorek Byrnison's armor as he leaped fully clad over the sledges and into the fog, and that was followed by screams, snarling, crunching and tearing sounds, great smashing blows, cries of terror and roars of bearish fury as he laid them waste.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉正在开阔的地方，箭从她头顶上方飞过。潘特莱蒙在她之前就听到了声音，立刻变成一只豹子，把她撞倒，不让她成为靶子。莱拉擦掉眼睛里的雪，翻过身来，想看看是怎么回事，因为半明半暗中，到处是一片混乱和喧嚣。这时，她听到一声震耳欲聋的怒吼，埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松全身披挂，跳过几个雪橇，冲进雾气中，身上的盔甲叮叮当当地，发出刮擦声。紧接着，便传来尖叫声、吼叫声、咔嚓声和撕裂声，伴随着披甲熊把他们摧毁时发出的粉碎性的击打声、恐惧的哭喊声、披甲熊愤怒的咆哮声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But who was them? Lyra had seen no enemy figures yet. The gyptians were swarming to defend the sledges, but that (as even Lyra could see) made them better targets; and their rifles were not easy to fire in gloves and mittens; she had only heard four or five shots, as against the ceaseless knocking rain of arrows. And more and more men fell every minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他们到底是什么人？莱拉还没有看见敌人的影子。吉卜赛人蜂拥着来保护他们的雪橇，但这使他们成了更加明显的目标（甚至连莱拉都看得出来）；而且他们带着手套的手也不容易开来复枪；在持续的箭雨中，莱拉只听见四五声枪响。每分钟都有更多的人倒在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she had no more than a second to think that, for there was a mighty snarl from Pantalaimon, and something -- another daemon -- hurtled at him and knocked him down, crushing all the breath out of Lyra herself; and then hands were hauling at her, lifting her, stifling her cry with foul-smelling mittens, tossing her through the air into another's arms, and then pushing her flat down into the snow again, so that she was dizzy and breathless and hurt all at once. Her arms were hauled behind till her shoulders cracked, and someone lashed her wrists together, and then a hood was crammed over her head to muffle her screams, for scream she did, and lustily:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，这个想法也仅仅一闪而过，因为潘特莱蒙突然怒吼了一声，有个东西——是另一个精灵——向潘特莱蒙猛扑过去，把他撞翻在地，莱拉吓得几乎喘不过气来。紧接着，几只手抓住了莱拉，把她举起来，臭烘烘的棉布手套捂着她的嘴，不让她叫出声来，然后把她扔到另一个人的怀里，接着又把她平平地压进雪地里，莱拉立刻觉得一阵眩晕，喘不上气来，全身疼痛难当。有人向后搬着她的胳膊，她的肩膀发出咔咔的声音。有人把她的手腕绑在一起，接着，他们使劲用一个头罩蒙住她的头，以便隔住她的尖叫——因为她正在竭尽全力地大声尖叫着：">查看中文翻译</div>

The sounds that reached her were wild and confused.

<div class="line_cn" title="这时传来一记鞭子声，奔跑着的狗大声吠叫起来。根据自己颠簸的程度，莱拉能判断出他们的速度有多快。尽管她竖起耳朵，想听听搏斗的声音，但能分辨出来的只不过是一阵凄凉的枪声，因为距离遥远而显得非常微弱；后来，她所能听到的就只剩下咯吱声、奔跑声和爪子在雪地上轻轻的拍击声了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the far end of this arena the sledge halted. They were outside a low building, or a range of low buildings, over which the snow lay deeply. It was hard to tell, but she had the impression that tunnels connected one part of the buildings with another, tunnels humped under the snow. At one side a stout metal mast had a familiar look, though she couldn't say what it reminded her of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪橇在这片竞技场的尽头停了下来。他们停在一座低矮的房子外面，或者说是一排低矮的房子，房顶上盖着厚厚的积雪。尽管很难说得准，但莱拉隐约觉得，这些房子的某一部分都是被隧道——雪下面隆起的隧道——连在一起的。房子的一侧立着一根粗壮的旗杆，莱拉觉得有点儿熟悉，但也不知道它让她想起了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She woke up when the motion of the sledge changed. It was suddenly smoother, and when she opened her eyes there were passing lights dazzling above her, so bright she had to pull the hood further over her head before peering out again. She was horribly stiff and cold, but she managed to pull herself upright enough to see that the sledge was driving swiftly between a row of high poles, each carrying a glaring anbaric light. As she got her bearings, they passed through an open metal gate at the end of the avenue of lights and into a wide open space like an empty marketplace or an arena for some game or sport. It was perfectly flat and smooth and white, and about a hundred yards across. Around the edge ran a high metal fence.</div>
