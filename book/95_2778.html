<div class="line_en">In high school, the attention of girls was not an affliction I suffered from. I wasn't the hot guy in class. I wasn't even the cute guy in class. I was ugly. Puberty was not kind to me. My acne was so bad that people used to ask what was wrong with me, like I'd had an allergic reaction to something. It was the kind of acne that qualifies as a medical condition. Acne vulgaris, the doctor called it. We're not talking about pimples, kids. We're talking pustules -- big, pus-filled blackheads and whiteheads. They started on my forehead, spread down the sides of my face, and covered my cheeks and neck and ravaged me everywhere.</div>

<div class="line_en">Being poor didn't help. Not only could I not afford a decent haircut, leaving me with a huge, unruly Afro, but my mother also used to get angry at the fact that I grew out of my school uniforms too fast, so to save money she started buying my clothes three sizes too big. My blazer was too long and my pants were too baggy and my shoes flopped around. I was a clown. And of course, Murphy's Law, the year my mom started buying my clothes too big was the year that I stopped growing. So now I was never going to grow into my clown clothes and I was stuck being a clown. The only thing I had going for me was the fact that I was tall, but even there I was gangly and awkward-looking. Duck feet. High ass. Nothing worked.</div>

<div class="line_en">For me to try to get a girl would have upset the natural order of things. Part of my success as the tuck-shop guy was that I was welcome everywhere, and I was welcome everywhere because I was nobody. I was the acne-ridden clown with duck feet in floppy shoes. I wasn't a threat to the guys. I wasn't a threat to the girls. The minute I became somebody, I risked no longer being welcomed as nobody. The pretty girls were already spoken for. The popular guys had staked their claim. They would say, "I like Zuleika," and you knew that meant if you tried anything with Zuleika there'd be a fight. In the interest of survival, the smart move was to stay on the fringe, stay out of trouble.</div>

What I learned was that cool guys get girls, and funny guys get to hang out with the cool guys with their girls. I was not a cool guy; therefore I did not have girls. I understood that formula very quickly and I knew my place. I didn't ask girls out. I didn't have a girlfriend. I didn't even try.</div>

<div class="line_en">Johanna and Zaheera were always together. They were one grade below me, but in terms of popularity they were three grades above me. Still I got to hang out with them because I knew Johanna and we had this thing from being in different schools together. Dating girls may have been out of the question for me, but talking to them was not, because I could make them laugh. Human beings like to laugh, and lucky for me pretty girls are human beings. So I could relate to them in that way, but never in the other way. I knew this because whenever they stopped laughing at my jokes and stories they'd say, "So how do you think I can get Daniel to ask me out?" I always had a clear idea of where I stood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outwardly, I had carefully cultivated my status as the funny, nonthreatening guy, but secretly I had the hugest crush on Zaheera. She was so pretty and so funny. We'd hang out and have great conversations. I thought about her constantly, but for the life of me I never considered myself worthy of dating her.

<div class="line_en">At a certain point I decided to map out a strategy. I decided I'd be best friends with Zaheera and stay friends with her long enough to ask her to the matric dance, what we call our senior prom. Mind you, we were in grade nine at this point. The matric dance was three years away. But I decided to play the long game. I was like, Yep, just gonna take my time. Because that's what happens in the movies, right? I'd seen my American high school movies. You hang around long enough as the friendly good guy and the girl dates a bunch of handsome jerks, and then one day she turns around and goes, "Oh, it's you. It was always you. You're the guy I was supposed to be with all along."</div>

This was the landline. To her house. Where her parents might answer. We were talking one afternoon at school and I asked, "Can I get your phone number? Maybe I can call you and we can talk at home sometime." She said yes, and my mind exploded. What???!!!! A girl is giving me her phone number???!!! This is insane!!! What do I do??!! I was so nervous. I'll never forget her telling me the digits one by one as I wrote them down, trying to keep my hand from shaking. We said goodbye and went our separate ways to class, and I was like, Okay, Trevor. Play it cool. Don't call her right away. I called her that night. At seven. She'd given me her number at two. That was me being cool. Dude, don't call her at five. That's too obvious.

In Soweto I was the only white kid in the black township. In Eden Park I was the only mixed kid in the colored area.

It was a largely Jewish neighborhood, and Jewish people don't flee. They're done fleeing. They've already fled. They get to a place, build their shul, and hold it down.

<div class="line_en">I didn't make any friends in Highlands North for the longest time. I had an easier time making friends in Eden Park, to be honest. In the suburbs, everyone lived behind walls. The white neighborhoods of Johannesburg were built on white fear -- fear of black crime, fear of black uprisings and reprisals -- and as a result virtually every house sits behind a six-foot wall, and on top of that wall is electric wire. Everyone lives in a plush, fancy maximum-security prison. There is no sitting on the front porch, no saying hi to the neighbors, no kids running back and forth between houses. I'd ride my bike around the neighborhood for hours without seeing a single kid. I'd hear them, though. They were all meeting up behind brick walls for playdates I wasn't invited to. I'd hear people laughing and playing and I'd get off my bike and creep up and peek over the wall and see a bunch of white kids splashing around in someone's swimming pool. I was like a Peeping Tom, but for friendship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在高地北的很长一段时间内，我一个朋友都没有。实话说，相比之下，我在伊登公园都比这里要容易交到朋友。在这片郊区，所有人都住在高墙里。约翰内斯堡的白人社区是建立在白人恐惧之上的——恐惧黑人犯罪，恐惧黑人暴动，恐惧黑人复仇——结果就是，所有的家庭都修葺了两米高的墙，顶上还安了电网。每个人都住在极度安全的豪华监狱里，没有小孩会在房子之间跑来跑去。我可以骑着自行车在附近转悠几个小时，然后看不见一个小孩，虽然我可能听到他们的声音。他们都在高墙后面，请了朋友们来家里玩耍，但没有人邀请过我。我可以听到他们嬉笑打闹的声音，然后我会下车，爬上墙，往他们的院子里望去，我会看到几个白人小孩在游泳池里相互泼水。我就像个变态偷窥狂，只是我偷窥的是朋友之间的友谊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was only after a year or so that I figured out the key to making black friends in the suburbs: the children of domestics. Many domestic workers in South Africa, when they get pregnant they get fired. Or, if they're lucky, the family they work for lets them stay on and they can have the baby, but then the baby goes to live with relatives in the homelands. Then the black mother raises the white children, seeing her own child only once a year at the holidays. But a handful of families would let their domestics keep their children with them, living in little maids' quarters or flatlets in the backyard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一年左右，我才找到在这种郊区交到朋友的诀窍：用人的孩子。在南非，很多用人一旦怀孕就被解雇了。如果够幸运的话，雇主家庭会把她留下，但生完孩子后，就要把小孩送回黑人家园让亲戚来照顾，然后这位黑人母亲要回来照顾雇主家的白人小孩，自己只能在一年一次的假期里看到自己的孩子。但是也有一批家庭，同意让用人把自己的小孩带在身边，她们可以带着小孩住在后院的用人房中。">查看中文翻译</div>
