<div class="line_en">He read one of them every six months, he said. And why should that make Charles Tansley angry? He rushed in (all, thought Mrs Ramsay, because Prue will not be nice to him) and denounced the Waverly novels when he knew nothing about it, nothing about it whatsoever, Mrs Ramsay thought, observing him rather than listening to what he said. She could see how it was from his manner -- he wanted to assert himself, and so it would always be with him till he got his Professorship or married his wife, and so need not be always saying, "I -- I -- I." For that was what his criticism of poor Sir Walter, or perhaps it was Jane Austen, amounted to. "I --- I --- I." He was thinking of himself and the impression he was making, as she could tell by the sound of his voice, and his emphasis and his uneasiness. Success would be good for him. At any rate they were off again. Now she need not listen. It could not last, she knew, but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people, and their thoughts and their feelings, without effort like a light stealing under water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing themselves, and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging, trembling. So she saw them; she heard them; but whatever they said had also this quality, as if what they said was like the movement of a trout when, at the same time, one can see the ripple and the gravel, something to the right, something to the left; and the whole is held together; for whereas in active life she would be netting and separating one thing from another; she would be saying she liked the Waverly novels or had not read them; she would be urging herself forward; now she said nothing. For the moment, she hung suspended.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let us enjoy what we do enjoy," he said. His integrity seemed to Mrs Ramsay quite admirable. He never seemed for a moment to think, But how does this affect me? But then if you had the other temperament, which must have praise, which must have encouragement, naturally you began (and she knew that Mr Ramsay was beginning) to be uneasy; to want somebody to say, Oh, but your work will last, Mr Ramsay, or something like that. He showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying, with some irritation, that, anyhow, Scott (or was it Shakespeare?) would last him his lifetime. He said it irritably. Everybody, she thought, felt a little uncomfortable, without knowing why. Then Minta Doyle, whose instinct was fine, said bluffly, absurdly, that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading Shakespeare. Mr Ramsay said grimly (but his mind was turned away again) that very few people liked it as much as they said they did. But, he added, there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless, and Mrs Ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at Minta, and she, Mrs Ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about himself, would, in her own way, see that he was taken care of, and praise him, somehow or other. But she wished it was not necessary: perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary. Anyhow, she was free now to listen to what Paul Rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy. They lasted, he said. He had read some of Tolstoi at school. There was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten the name. Russian names were impossible, said Mrs Ramsay. "Vronsky," said Paul. He remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain. "Vronsky," said Mrs Ramsay; "Oh, ANNA KARENINA," but that did not take them very far; books were not in their line. No, Charles Tansley would put them both right in a second about books, but it was all so mixed up with, Am I saying the right thing? Am I making a good impression? that, after all, one knew more about him than about Tolstoi, whereas, what Paul said was about the thing, simply, not himself, nothing else. Like all stupid people, he had a kind of modesty too, a consideration for what you were feeling, which, once in a way at least, she found attractive. Now he was thinking, not about himself, or about Tolstoi, but whether she was cold, whether she felt a draught, whether she would like a pear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我们欣赏我们真正欣赏的东西吧，”他说。拉姆齐夫人觉得他的正直诚实令人称羡。他似乎从来不想：这对我会有什么影响？可是如果你有另一种性格，非得有人夸奖不可，非得有人鼓励不可，你自然就会开始感到不安（她知道拉姆齐先生已开始有这种感觉）；会希望有人说，哦，但是拉姆齐先生，你的作品是会流传下去的，或者类似的什么话。现在他有点恼怒地在说，不管怎么说，他一辈子都会读司各特（还是莎土比亚？）这话明显地反映了他的不安。话说得很激动。每个人，她心想，都不知为何觉得有点不安。于是具有敏感的直觉的明塔·多伊尔直楞楞地、可笑地说，她不相信会有什么人真喜欢读莎士比亚。拉姆齐先生冷冷地说（但他的心境已经转变），很少有人像他们嘴里说的那样喜欢莎土比亚。但是，他补充道，莎士比亚有些剧本还是有相当大的优点的；这时拉姆齐夫人看到，至少此刻总算没事了；他会笑话明塔，而明塔，拉姆齐夫人看到，意识到他是多么在于别人对他的看法，就会以自己的方式来满足他。想法子去恭维他。但是她又希望不必如此：也许是她自己的过错才搞得必须这样做。不管怎样，她现在可以放心地听保罗·雷勒谈他小时候读过的书了。他说，这些书永远留在记忆里。他上学时读过托尔斯泰的一些作品，其中一本他一直记得，不过他把名字给忘了。俄国人名太难记了，拉姆齐夫人说。“渥伦斯基。”保罗说。他记住了这个名字，因为他一直觉得这名字对一个反面人物太合适了。“渥伦斯基。”拉姆齐夫人说；“哦，是《安娜·卡列尼娜》，”但是他们没有能够谈下去；书籍不是他们擅长的话题。不对，在有关书的问题上，查尔斯·坦斯利一秒钟就能纠正他们俩的错误，但是他的话里总会夹杂着暗含的担忧；这话该说吗？我给人好印象了吗？其结果是，听的人对他的了解胜过对托尔斯泰的了解，而保罗说的就是事情本身，不谈自己。他和所有迟钝的人—样，有一种谦逊的品德，照顾别人的感情；她起码有时觉得这很吸引人。现在他想到的就既不是他自己，也不是托尔斯泰，而是她是不是有点冷，是不是有穿堂风吹着她了，她想不想吃一只梨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, but how long do you think it'll last?" said somebody. It was as if she had antennae trembling out from her, which, intercepting certain sentences, forced them upon her attention. This was one of them. She scented danger for her husband. A question like that would lead, almost certainly, to something being said which reminded him of his own failure. How long would he be read -- he would think at once. William Bankes (who was entirely free from all such vanity) laughed, and said he attached no importance to changes in fashion. Who could tell what was going to last -- in literature or indeed in anything else?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，但是你认为这会流行多久？”有人说。好像从她身上颤动着伸出的一对触角，截下了一些句子，迫使她去注意它们。这就是其中的一句。她嗅出这里面对她丈夫存在的危险。这样的一个问题几乎肯定会引起一些别的话，使他想起自己的失败。他的书还会流行多久——他立刻就会想到这一点。威廉·班克斯（他完全没有这种虚荣心）笑了起来，他说，对他说来，时尚的变化根本无关紧要。谁能说得出什么会长存——无论在文学还是在其他一切方面？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, she said, she did not want a pear. Indeed she had been keeping guard over the dish of fruit (without realising it) jealously, hoping that nobody would touch it. Her eyes had been going in and out among the curves and shadows of the fruit, among the rich purples of the lowland grapes, then over the horny ridge of the shell, putting a yellow against a purple, a curved shape against a round shape, without knowing why she did it, or why, every time she did it, she felt more and more serene; until, oh, what a pity that they should do it -- a hand reached out, took a pear, and spoilt the whole thing. In sympathy she looked at Rose. She looked at Rose sitting between Jasper and Prue. How odd that one's child should do that!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不吃，她说，她不想吃梨，其实她一直在留意地保护着那盘水果（但并没有意识到这一点），希望谁也不要碰它。她的目光在水果的曲线和阴影之间来回移动，先停留在低地生产的深紫色的葡萄上，然后移到贝壳果盘坚硬的隆起的边上，时而让紫色衬托黄色，时而让圆形和弧形对比，自己也不知道为什么这样做，也不知道为什么每次这样做时心里都感到越来越安详；直到，啊，多么遗憾他们竟然这么干了——一只手伸了过来，拿了一个梨；把一切都破坏了。她惋惜地向萝丝看去。她看着坐在贾斯珀和普鲁之间的萝丝。真奇怪自己的孩子竟会做这事！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How odd to see them sitting there, in a row, her children, Jasper, Rose, Prue, Andrew, almost silent, but with some joke of their own going on, she guessed, from the twitching at their lips. It was something quite apart from everything else, something they were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room. It was not about their father, she hoped. No, she thought not. What was it, she wondered, sadly rather, for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was not there. There was all that hoarded behind those rather set, still, mask-like faces, for they did not join in easily; they were like the grown-up people. But when she looked at Prue tonight, she saw that this was not now quite true of her. She was just beginning, just moving, just descending. The faintest light was on her face, as if the glow of Minta opposite, some excitement, some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her, as if the sun of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table-cloth, and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it. She kept looking at Minta, shyly, yet curiously, so that Mrs Ramsay looked from one to the other and said, speaking to Prue in her own mind, You will be as happy as she is one of these days. You will be much happier, she added, because you are my daughter, she meant; her own daughter must be happier than other people's daughters. But dinner was over. It was time to go. They were only playing with things on their plates. She would wait until they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling. He was having a joke with Minta about a bet. Then she would get up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到他们，她的孩子们，在那儿坐成一排，有一种多么奇怪的感觉贾斯珀、萝丝、普鲁、安德鲁，他们几乎一声不响，但是她从他们嘴唇的轻轻抽动猜测，他们之间有着自己的玩笑。它和这儿的事没有关系，他们藏在心里等回到自己的房间以后再去笑个痛快。她希望他们要笑的不是他们的父亲。不是的，她想不是的。究竟是什么呢，她带着几分伤感地想道，因为她感到他们要等她不在场时才会大笑。在那些板着的、没有表情的、面具般的面孔后面藏着那一切她所不知道的事情，他们很难参加进大人的谈话中；他们像旁观者、检查员，有点超出成年人，或和他们有着一段距离。不过当她今晚看着普鲁的时候，她觉得对于普鲁来说情况不完全是这样：她正在开始移向成人世界、落向成人世界。她脸上微微发亮，仿佛坐在对面的明塔的满面红光，那激动、那对幸福的期盼，反射到了普鲁的脸上，仿佛男女之爱的太阳从桌布的边缘升起，她并不知情地向它俯下身去迎接它：她不停地看着明塔，既羞涩又好奇，使得拉姆齐夫人的目光在他们俩人间移来移去，心里在对普鲁说，有一天你会和她一样幸福的。你会比她幸福得多，她补充道，因为你是我的女儿，这是她话的含义；她的女儿一定要比别人的女儿幸福。但现在晚餐结束了。该离席了。他们只是在把盘子上的食物扒拉着玩而已。她丈夫在讲着什么故事，他和明塔就打赌的事在开玩笑，她得等到大家听完笑完，然后站起身来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She liked Charles Tansley, she thought, suddenly; she liked his laugh. She liked him for being so angry with Paul and Minta. She liked his awkwardness. There was a lot in that young man after all. And Lily, she thought, putting her napkin beside her plate, she always has some joke of her own. One need never bother about Lily. She waited. She tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate. Well, were they done now? No. That story had led to another story. Her husband was in great spirits tonight, and wishing, she supposed, to make it all right with old Augustus after that scene about the soup, had drawn him in -- they were telling stories about some one they had both known at college. She looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black, and strangely, as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral, for she did not listen to the words. The sudden bursts of laughter and then one voice (Minta's) speaking alone, reminded her of men and boys crying out the Latin words of a service in some Roman Catholic cathedral. She waited. Her husband spoke. He was repeating something, and she knew it was poetry from the rhythm and the ring of exultation, and melancholy in his voice:</div>
