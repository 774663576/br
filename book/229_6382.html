<div class="line_en">"We hear you're a very clever man, shepherd," added Joseph Poorgrass from behind the maltster's bed, where he had been hiding. "We all wish we were as clever as you, don't we, neighbours?" There was general agreement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“牧羊人，我们听说你是个很聪明的人，”约瑟夫·普格拉斯从酒店老板的床后边接口说，他一直躲在那儿。“我们都希望我们像你一样聪明，是吧，邻居们？”人们都表示同意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"well, look here, neighbours." Gabriel, although normally one of the quietest and most gentle men on earth, had suddenly become aggressive. "The first man I hear saying anything bad about our mistress will receive this in his face," and he banged his great heavy hand down on the maltster's table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哼，告诉你们，邻居们，”盖伯瑞尔，这个世上最安静、最温柔的人，突然变得咄咄逼人。“我要是听到谁说女主人的坏话，他的脸上首先就会尝到这个，”接着他把他的大手重重地击在了酒店老板的桌子上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know your name, but I want to thank you for your kindness to me on the night I left Weatherbury. I'm also returning the money you gave me. I'm happy to say I'm going to marry the young man who has been courting me, Sergeant Troy. As he is a nobleman's son, I know he wouldn't like me to accept a gift from anyone. Please don't tell anyone about my marriage. We intend to surprise Weatherbury by arriving there as husband and wife, very soon. Thank you again.</div>

I met her on my way to Weatherbury, but I didn't know then who she was." When Mr Boldwood had finished reading the letter, he looked very serious. "Poor Fanny!" he said. "I don't think this Sergeant Troy will ever marry her. He's clever, and handsome, but he can't be trusted. What a silly girl Fanny is!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="盖伯瑞尔的问题还没出口，伯德伍德先生就抢着回答说，“想弄清楚是谁写的情人卡是很正常的，这就是乐趣。”他的态度却没有显示出任何乐趣。“再见，奥克，”他说着慢慢走回了他的空屋子。">查看中文翻译</div>

At last he turned, and marched bravely back the way he had come, through the rows of smiling women.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later, in the town north of Weatherbury where the soldiers were staying, a wedding was arranged As the church clock in the square struck half-past eleven, a handsome young soldier marched into the church and spoke to the vicar Then he stood still in the centre of the church, waiting for his bride. The church was full of the women and girls who had attended the morning service and had decided to wait to see the wedding. They watched the young man's straight back, whispering among themselves. The soldier waited without moving a muscle. The church clock struck a quarter to twelve, and still the bride did not come. The whispers stopped, and there was silence. The young man stood as stiff and straight as the church columns around him. There was a little quiet laughter from some of the women, but soon they were silent again, waiting for the end.</div>
