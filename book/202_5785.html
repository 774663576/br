<div class="line_en">Harry's first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid's hut. However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利首先想到的是禁林，有一瞬间，虽然知道他们三人出现在霍格沃茨是多么愚蠢，多么危险，但想到从树林间偷偷溜进海格的小屋，他的心仍然兴奋得怦怦跳起来。这时罗恩低低地呻吟了一声，哈利向他爬过去，很快发现这里不是禁林：树木看上去年轻一些，间距较大，地面也更空旷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no idea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw that the object was Ron's foot. Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利睁开眼睛，看到一片炫目的金色和绿色。他不知道发生了什么，只知道自己似乎是躺在树枝和细树枝间。他艰难地吸气，肺像被压瘪了一样。他眨眨眼睛，意识到那耀眼的色彩是透过高高的树冠洒下的阳光。一个东西在他脸旁抽动了一下，他用手撑地跪了起来，以为会看到某种凶狠的小动物，却原来是罗恩的脚。哈利环顾四周，发现他们和赫敏都躺在森林中的地面上，好像没有别人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron's head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry's mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron's left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在罗恩脑袋旁边碰到了赫敏，她也在爬着。一看见罗恩，哈利把一切都忘光了，因为罗恩的左半身都浸在血里，枕在泥土和落叶上的面孔死灰一样的白。复方汤剂的药性正在消失。罗恩的模样介于卡特莫尔和他自己之间，脸上仅有的一点血色退去的同时，头发却越来越红了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this… His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron's upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利惊恐地看着她撕开罗恩的衬衫，他一直以为分体是滑稽的事情，可这次……他的五脏不舒服地搅动起来，赫敏裸露出罗恩的上臂，那里少了一大块肉，好像被刀子剜走的一般……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利揪下小瓶上的塞子，赫敏接过瓶子，在流血的伤口上倒了三滴药液。绿烟滚滚升起，当它散去之后，哈利看到血已经止住，伤口看上去好像已经长了几天，刚才暴露的血肉上面覆盖了一层新皮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无法掩饰，哈利知道她说的是事实，这是个沉重的打击。如果亚克斯利已经能进那所房子，他们确实是回不去了。现在亚克斯利可能正用幻影显形把其他食死徒带到那里。那所房子虽然阴暗压抑，却曾是他们惟一安全的庇护所，现在克利切已经开心友好得多，它甚至有几分像家了。想到那家养小精灵忙着做哈利、罗恩和赫敏再也吃不到的牛排腰子馅饼，哈利心中一阵难过，但不是为了食物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"-- the first place you thought of," Harry finished for her, glancing around at the apparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of -- how Death Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“——你想到的第一个地方。”哈利替他说完，望望这片似乎无人的林间空地，不禁想起上次他们幻影显形到赫敏想到的第一个地方时，食死徒几分钟内就发现了他们。是摄神取念吗？伏地魔或其党羽是否现在就已知道赫敏把他们带到了哪儿？">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果要待在这儿，就得在周围设一些防护魔法。”她答道，举着魔杖，开始在哈利和罗恩旁边绕着一个大圈走动，嘴里念念有词。哈利看到周围的空气有轻微的颤动，仿佛赫敏在空地上方变出了一股热气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次他没再费劲去摸，而是又用了个飞来咒。一堆帆布、绳子和杆子飞了出来，大概是因为散发着一股猫味吧，哈利认出这正是他们在魁地奇世界杯那一夜睡的帐篷。">查看中文翻译</div>

The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it: a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利和赫敏连拖带抱地把罗恩弄进帐篷。里面和哈利记忆中的一样：一个小套间，配有卫生间和小小的厨房。他推开一把旧扶手椅，小心地把罗恩放到一张双层床的下铺。这短短的路程也已经让罗恩更加苍白，一被安放到床垫上，他就又闭上眼睛，好一会儿没说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Mugglerepelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten o'clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing.</div>

Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry's head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too?
