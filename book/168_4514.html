<div class="line_en">Her son had returned to Riverrun, and Grey Wind with him. Only the scent of the great grey direwolf could send the hounds into such a frenzy of baying and barking. He will come to me, she knew. Edmure had not returned after his first visit, preferring to spend his days with Marq Piper and Patrek Mallister, listening to Rymund the Rhymer's verses about the battle at the Stone Mill. Robb is not Edmure, though. Robb will see me.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been raining for days now, a cold grey downpour that well suited Catelyn's mood. Her father was growing weaker and more delirious with every passing day, waking only to mutter, "Tansy," and beg forgiveness. Edmure shunned her, and Ser Desmond Grell still denied her freedom of the castle, however unhappy it seemed to make him. Only the return of Ser Robin Ryger and his men, footweary and drenched to the bone, served to lighten her spirits. They had walked back, it seemed. Somehow the Kingslayer had contrived to sink their galley and escape, Maester Vyman confided. Catelyn asked if she might speak with Ser Robin to learn more of what had happened, but that was refused her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Something else was wrong as well. On the day her brother returned, a few hours after their argument, she had heard angry voices from the yard below. When she climbed to the roof to see, there were knots of men gathered across the castle beside the main gate. Horses were being led from the stables, saddled and bridled, and there was shouting, though Catelyn was too far away to make out the words. one of Robb's white banners lay on the ground, and one of the knights turned his horse and trampled over the direwolf as he spurred toward the gate. Several others did the same. Those are men who fought with Edmure on the fords, she thought. What could have made them so angry? Has my brother slighted them somehow, given them some insult? She thought she recognized Ser Perwyn Frey, who had traveled with her to Bitterbridge and Storm's End and back, and his bastard half brother Martyn Rivers as well, but from this vantage it was hard to be certain. Close to forty men poured out through the castle gates, to what end she did not know.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmure stood below the crowded dais, head bowed modestly as Robb praised his victory. "… fell at the Stone Mill shall never be forgotten. Small wonder Lord Tywin ran off to fight Stannis. He'd had his fill of northmen and rivermen both." That brought laughter and approving shouts, but Robb raised a hand for quiet. "Make no mistake, though. The Lannisters will march again, and there will be other battles to win before the kingdom is secure."</div>

<div class="line_en">Robb stood on the dais. He is a boy no longer, she realized with a pang. He is sixteen now, a man grown. fust look at him. War had melted all the softness from his face and left him hard and lean. He had shaved his beard away, but his auburn hair fell uncut to his shoulders. The recent rains had rusted his mail and left brown stains on the white of his cloak and surcoat. Or perhaps the stains were blood. On his head was the sword crown they had fashioned him of bronze and iron. He bears it more comfortably now He bears it like a king.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only a few noted Catelyn and Ser Desmond amidst the tumult, but they elbowed their fellows, and slowly a hush grew around her. She held her head high and ignored the eyes. Let them think what they will. It is Robb's judgment that matters.</div>

<div class="line_en">Utherydes Wayn banged his staff on the floor as Ser Desmond escorted her forward. If Robb looks at me as Edmure did, I do not know what I will do. But it seemed to her that it was not anger she saw in her son's eyes, but something else… apprehension, perhaps? No, that made no sense. What should he fear? He was the Young Wolf, King of the Trident and the North.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴斯蒙爵士护她上前，乌瑟莱斯·韦恩将权杖往地上重重一击，表示肃静。若罗柏象艾德慕一样待我，怎么办？但从儿子眼中，她看到的不是愤怒，而是别的什么…忧惧？不，这不可能，他有什么好怕的？他是少狼主，三叉戟河与北境之王啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sight of Ser Brynden Tully's craggy face on the dais gave her comfort. A boy she did not know seemed to be acting as Robb's squire. Behind him stood a young knight in a sand-colored surcoat blazoned with seashells, and an older one who wore three black pepperpots on a saffron bend, across a field of green and silver stripes. Between them were a handsome older lady and a pretty maid who looked to be her daughter. There was another girl as well, near Sansa's age. The seashells were the sigil of some lesser house, Catelyn knew; the older man's she did not recognize. Prisoners? Why would Robb bring captives onto the dais?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高台上布林登·徒利粗犷的脸，使她感到安心。一个她不认识的男孩正担任罗柏的侍从，孩子后面站一个年轻骑士，穿着画了六只海贝的沙色外套，另一个年长骑士的徽章则是三个黑色胡椒罐，底色为绿银相间的斑纹。他们间有一位端庄的老妇人和一位美貌少女，看来是她女儿。此外，还有一个跟珊莎年纪相仿的女孩。海贝是西境某家小诸侯的纹章，凯特琳知道，但那个老骑士的纹章她不认识。他们是囚犯吗？罗柏为何让俘虏站到高台上？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Enough." For just an instant Robb sounded more like Brandon than his father. "No man calls my lady of Winterfell a traitor in my hearing, Lord Rickard." When he turned to Catelyn, his voice softened. "If I could wish the Kingslayer back in chains I would. You freed him without my knowledge or consent… but what you did, I know you did for love. For Arya and Sansa, and out of grief for Bran and Rickon. Love's not always wise, I've learned. It can lead us to great folly, but we follow our hearts… wherever they take us. Don't we, Mother?"

The Greation, no respecter of proprieties, lifted her off her feet and squeezed her arms with his huge hairy hands. "Your wolf pup mauled the Kingslayer once, he'll do it again if need be." Galbart Glover and Lord Jason Mallister were cooler, and Jonos Bracken almost icy, but their words were courteous enough. Her brother was the last to approach her.

He played out that mummer's farce in the Great Hall so as not to shame you before your own people.

We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast, then slip behind him to take up a strong defensive position athwart the gold road, at a place my scouts had found where the ground would have been greatly in our favor. If he had come at us there, he would have paid a grievous price. But if he did not attack, he would have been trapped in the west, a thousand leagues from where he needed to be. All the while we would have lived off his land, instead of him living off ours."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我军是马队，”布林登爵士解释，“兰尼斯特军泰半是步兵。我们计划让泰温公爵高高兴兴地追上一段，直到海边，然后从旁溜过去，横穿黄金大道，占据稳固的防守位置。我的斥侯找到了地方，地形极为有利，如果他在那儿发动攻击，将付出惨重代价；如果他不进攻，则会被困在西境，不仅距离需要他的地方千里之遥，而且始终消耗着自己的资源，而不是掠夺三河诸侯。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When you stopped Lord Tywin on the Red Fork," said the Blackfish, liyou delayed him just long enough for riders out of Bitterbridge to reach him with word of what was happening to the east. Lord Tywin turned his host at once, joined up with Matthis Rowan and Randyll Tarly near the headwaters of the Blackwater, and made a forced march to Tumbler's Falls, where he found Mace Tyrell and two of his sons waiting with a huge host and a fleet of barges. They floated down the river, disembarked half a day's ride from the city, and took Stannis in the rear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在红叉河阻住泰温公爵，”黑鱼说，“呵，挡得可真久，刚好让苦桥来的信使赶上他的军队。泰温公爵立即让部队掉头，在黑水河源头附近跟马图斯·罗宛与蓝道·塔利会合，急行军到翻斗瀑——梅斯·提利尔和他两个儿子正带着大军和驳船队等在那里。于是他们合兵一股，顺流而下，在距离君临城半日马程的地方登陆，从后袭击史坦尼斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Catelyn remembered King Renly's court, as she had seen it at Bitterbridge. A thousand golden roses streaming in the wind, Queen Man gaery's shy smile and soft words, her brother the Knight of Flowers with the bloody linen around his temples. If you had to fall into a woman's arms, my son, why couldn't they have been Margaery Tyrell's? The wealth and power of Highgarden could have made all the difference in the fighting yet to come. And perhaps Grey Wind would have liked the smell of her as well.</div>
