<div class="line_en">The supply ships, coming and going far out in space, had been real enough; but the silver clouds that had hung for a lifetime above almost all the capitals of Earth had been an illusion. How it had been done, no one could tell, but it seemed that every one of those ships had been nothing more than an image of Karellen's own vessel. Yet it had been far more than a matter of playing with light, for radar had also been deceived, and there were still men alive who swore that they had heard the shriek of torn air as the fleet came in through the skies of Earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was only the single ship now, hanging above New York. Indeed, as the world had just discovered, the ships above Man's other cities had never existed. The day before, the great fleet of the Overlords had dissolved into nothingness, fading like mists beneath the morning dew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了纽约上空的那艘飞船，人们发现其余城市上空的飞船从来就没有真正存在过。昨天，那支庞大的舰队就像清早露水降临时分的薄雾般消失得无影无踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is the day!" whispered the radios in a hundred tongues. "This is the day!" said the headlines of a thousand newspapers. "This is the day!" thought the cameramen as they checked and rechecked the equipment gathered round the vast empty space upon which Karellen's ship would be descending.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The ship is moving!" came the word, flashed instantly to every corner of the planet. "It is heading westward!"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not important; all that mattered was that Karellen no longer felt the need for this display of force. He had thrown away his psychological weapons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今这一切全都不再重要，最关键的还是卡瑞林认为没有必要再显示自己的武力，决定放弃那些心理战术了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At less than a thousand kilometres an hour, falling slowly down from the empty heights of the stratosphere, the ship moved out to the great plains and to its second rendezvous with history. It settled down obediently before the waiting cameras and the packed thousands of spectators, so few of whom could see as much as the millions gathered round their TV sets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那艘飞船时速不到一千公里，从高空缓缓下降，朝着大平原飞来，开始了跨历史的又一瞬间。现场几千观众挤得人山人海，看到的东西远没有数百万电视观众看到的多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ground should have cracked and trembled beneath that tremendous weight, but the vessel was still in the grip of whatever forces drove it among the stars. It kissed the earth as gently as a falling snowflake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如此庞大沉重的飞船降落到地面上，地面肯定会“吱嘎”作响，发出阵阵颤抖，但飞船似乎仍保留着太空飞行时的那种神秘力量，像一朵雪花飘然落下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The curving wall twenty metres above the ground seemed to flow and shimmer: where there had been a smooth and shining surface, a great opening had appeared. Nothing was visible within it, even to the questing eyes of the camera. It was as dark and shadowed as the entrance to a cave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="飞船舱体高达二十米，在众人眼中，犹如一堵弧形的墙，在阳光下闪着微光。突然，平滑的墙面上出现了一个巨大的门，就像山洞的洞口，里面光线十分昏暗，什么也看不清。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“舷梯边上有些小朋友，我想请两个上来见我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was silence for a moment. Then a boy and a girl broke from the crowd and walked, with complete lack of self-consciousness, towards the gangway and into history. Others followed, but stopped when Karellen's chuckle came from the ship. "Two will be enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群顿时鸦雀无声，一个小男孩和一个小女孩走出人群，往舷梯走去，他们似乎完全没有意识到是怎么回事。其他小孩见状，也跟在后面。卡瑞林笑了起来，“两个就够了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out of the orifice, a wide, glittering gangway extruded itself and drove purposefully towards the ground. It seemed a solid sheet of metal with hand-rails along either side. There were no steps; it was steep and smooth as a toboggan slide and, one would have thought, equally impossible to ascend or descend in any ordinary manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宽宽的、亮闪闪的舷梯伸出来了，一直降到地面上。舷梯两侧有扶手，中间一块闪亮的金属板，没有台阶，又滑又陡，和滑梯没什么两样。照常人的思维，无论如何也想象不出这样的舷梯该如何上下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The world was watching that dark portal, within which nothing had yet stirred. Then the seldom-heard yet unforgettable voice of Karellen floated softly down from some hidden source. His message could scarcely have been more unexpected</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a tribute to the Overlords' psychology, and to their careful years of preparation, that only a few people fainted. Yet there could have been fewer still, anywhere in the world, who did not feel the ancient terror brush for one awful instant against their minds before reason banished it forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸亏这些外星人研究过人类的心理，又做了多年准备，现场只有很少几个人昏倒了——但几乎所有的人都想起了那个恐怖的古老传说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A vast silence lay over the whole world for the space of twenty seconds -- though, afterwards, no one could believe that the time had been so short. Then the darkness of the great opening seemed to move forward, and Karellen came forth into the sunlight. The boy was sitting on his left arm, the girl on his right. They were both too busy playing with Karellen's wings to take any notice of the watching multitude.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群静静地站着，短短二十秒钟竟是如此漫长。在那昏暗的舱口，卡瑞林出现了。他就站在阳光下，左手抱着小男孩，右手抱着小女孩，孩子们只顾忙着摆弄卡瑞林的翅膀，根本没有朝人群望一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Waving cheerfully to the crowds beneath, and to their anxious parents -- who, too late, had probably remembered the legend of the Pied Piper -- the children began swiftly ascending the steep slope. Yet their legs were motionless, and soon it was clear also that their bodies were tilted at right angles to that peculiar gangway. It possessed a private gravity of its own, one which could ignore that of Earth. The children were still enjoying this novel experience, and wondering what was drawing them upwards, when they disappeared into the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们兴奋地向人群、向父母挥手，可怜的父母这才想起那个穿花衣的吹笛手的可怕传说，想要拉回自己的孩子，已经来不及了。孩子们的脚没有动，身子在移动时和舷梯始终保持着一个适当的角度，一定是舷梯的某种奇怪力量让地球的引力失去了作用。那两个小孩对一切都感到新奇，他们进入飞船，消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no mistake. The leathery wings, the little horns, the barbed tail -- all were there. The most terrible of all legends had come to life, out of the unknown past. Yet now it stood smiling, in ebon majesty, with the sunlight gleaming upon its tremendous body, and with a human child resting trustfully on either arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，背上一双肉质的翅膀，头上一对小小的犄角，身后一根带刺的尾巴，全都在那儿，传说中最恐怖的描述变成了现实，他就在眼前，巨大的身躯沐浴在阳光下，满面笑容地抱着两个对他无比信赖的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
