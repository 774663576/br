<div class="line_en">It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore's body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix's silver knife. Harry's voice was still saying, "Dobby… Dobby…" even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像是陷入了一个以前的噩梦，一瞬间哈利仿佛又跪在邓布利多的遗体旁边，在霍格沃茨最高的塔楼下面，但现实是他正凝视着蜷曲在草地上的小小身体，被贝拉特里克斯的银刀刺中的身体。哈利的声音仍在叫着：“多比……多比……”尽管他知道小精灵已经逝去，再也叫不回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions about burying the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry's grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海水在近处冲击着岩石，哈利聆听着波涛声，其他人在说话，讨论着哈利没有心思去听的事情，做着决定。迪安把受伤的拉环抱进了屋里，芙蓉匆匆跟了进去。比尔提议埋葬小精灵，哈利同意了，其实并没有意识到自己在说什么。他低头凝视着那小小的身体，伤疤刺痛着，火烧火燎。在脑海中的某个地方，像是从长长的望远镜倒着看过去似的，他看到伏地魔正在惩罚那些留在马尔福庄园的人，狂怒的样子极其恐怖，但哈利对多比之死的哀伤似乎减轻了那场雷霆大怒的影响，就像一场遥远的风景隔着辽阔、沉寂的海洋传来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I want to do it properly," were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. "Not by magic. Have you got a spade?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想好好安葬他，”这是哈利完全清醒后说的第一句话，“不用魔法。有铲子吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="片刻之后，他独自一人干了起来，在比尔指给的花园尽头的灌木丛中间，开始挖掘墓穴。他有些疯狂地挖着，体验着手工劳动的快慰，为不用魔法而自豪。他感觉每一滴汗水，每一个水泡，都是献给拯救了他们生命的小精灵的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys' returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利在又冷又硬的泥土中越挖越深，化悲痛为汗水，毫不理会伤疤的疼痛。黑暗中，只有他自己呼吸的声音和海涛为伴。马尔福家发生的事情一幕幕重现，他又想起了听到的那些事情，他在黑暗中突然醒悟……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out… though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伤疤灼痛着，但他能够战胜疼痛了，虽然仍然能感觉到它，但有了距离。他最终学会了控制，学会了把伏地魔关在大脑之外，这正是邓布利多要他向斯内普学习的东西。就像哈利为小天狼星悲伤的时候，伏地魔的思维无法控制哈利一样，现在哈利正在哀悼多比，伏地魔的思维也无法穿透哈利。似乎是悲伤把伏地魔赶了出去……尽管邓布利多当然会说那是爱……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own, and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果他们问他为什么不直接用魔杖营造一个完美的墓穴，哈利已经准备好了答案，但是没有用上。他俩都拿着铲子，跳进了哈利挖的墓穴，一起默默地挖掘，直到墓穴看起来足够深。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利用他的外套把小精灵包裹得更舒适一些。罗恩坐在墓穴边，脱掉鞋袜，给光脚的小精灵穿上。迪安拿出一顶羊毛帽子，哈利小心地把它戴在多比的头上，包住了那对蝙蝠般的耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur's coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf 's eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利没有听见其他人已从黑暗中走了过来。比尔穿着一件旅行斗篷，芙蓉系了条白色的大围裙，兜里插着一个瓶子，哈利认出是催长素。赫敏裹在一件借来的晨衣里，脸色苍白，站立不稳，勉强走到罗恩身边，罗恩伸手搂住了她。卢娜蜷缩在芙蓉的外套里，蹲了下来，手指温柔地抚着小精灵的眼皮，合上那双玻璃球般的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore's funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore's achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把小精灵放进了墓穴，摆好纤细的四肢让他好好休息，然后爬出来，最后一次凝视着他小小的身体。哈利强忍着不让自己崩溃，他想起了邓布利多的葬礼，一排排的金椅子，魔法部长坐在前排，宣读邓布利多的成就，白色的大理石坟墓庄严气派。他觉得多比也应该得到那样盛大的葬礼，然而小精灵却躺在灌木丛间一个草草掘成的土坑里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good-bye, Dobby," he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别了，多比。”他只能说这么多，好在卢娜已经全替他说了。比尔举起魔杖，墓穴旁的那堆泥土升到空中，又整齐地落下，堆成一个小小的红土丘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby's head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone's hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔杖有两根。他已经忘记了，恍然如梦，现在已想不起这些是谁的魔杖，只记得仿佛是从某个人手里抢过来的。他选了短的那一根，因为拿着舒服一些，然后用它指着那块石头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走进小门厅，众人都坐在起居室里，正在专心地听比尔说话。屋里色彩淡雅，装饰漂亮，一小块海边拣的浮木在壁炉里燃烧，放出明亮的光芒。哈利不想把泥巴弄在地毯上，便站在门口聆听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry's scar was still prickling.

<div class="line_en">He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin's sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他仍然紧握着格兰芬多宝剑，脸上的表情很奇怪：有点凶狠，又有点好奇。哈利看到了妖精灰黄的皮肤、细长的手指和黑色的眼睛。他的鞋子已经被芙蓉脱掉了，两只长脚脏兮兮的。他比家养小精灵大不了多少，一颗圆脑袋却比人类的脑袋大得多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, of course," said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin's eyes as he closed the door upon him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，当然。”哈利说，离开屋子之前，他欠身从妖精身旁拿走了格兰芬多宝剑。拉环没有抗议，但是哈利在关门时好像看到了妖精眼里的愤恨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who's been, places he's done something important?" said Ron, looking baffled. "Was he ever inside the Lestranges' vault?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”哈利说，“贝拉特里克斯一想到我们去过那儿就惊恐万分，简直歇斯底里了。为什么？她以为我们看到了什么？她以为我们还可能拿走了什么？她特别害怕神秘人发现那东西不在了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He said it the night he came back, I heard him."</div>

<div class="line_en">The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利突然想起他们第一次见面时，他就不能确定自己是不是喜欢奥利凡德。现在，即使在被伏地魔拷问和关押之后，这老头儿对于黑巫师拥有老魔杖的想法，似乎仍是既反感又着迷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You -- you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?" asked Hermione.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您——您真的认为这根魔杖是存在的吗？奥利凡德先生？”赫敏问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes," said Ollivander. "Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand's course through history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的，”奥利凡德说，“是的。在历史上完全有踪迹可寻。当然中间会有中断，很长时间的中断，它会从人们的视野里消失，暂时丢失或者隐藏起来，但总会重新出现。它有某些可识别的特征，研究过魔杖学的人会认得出来。有一些书面的记录，有的很隐晦，我和其他魔杖制作人专门研究过。那些记录有一定的真实性。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you -- you don't think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?" Hermione asked hopefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么您——您不认为它可能是一个传说，或是虚构的故事？”赫敏带着希望问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Ollivander. "Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”奥利凡德说，“至于它是否需要靠谋杀来转手，我不知道。它的历史是血腥的，但那可能只因为它是一件如此令人觊觎的器物，在巫师间引起强烈的欲望。它无比强大，在不适当的人手中会很危险，而对于我们研究魔杖能力的人来说，它是一件有莫大诱惑力的器物。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Never mind how I know it," said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north. "You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是一个谣传，”奥利凡德轻声说，“一个谣传，许多年前，早在你出生以前！我相信是格里戈维奇自己说出去的。你可以想见，如果传说他在研究和复制老魔杖的特性，这对他的生意多么有利啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught a glimpse of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他领着罗恩和赫敏下了楼，瞥见比尔、芙蓉、卢娜和迪安坐在厨房的桌旁，面前放着茶杯。当哈利走过门口时，他们都抬起头来，但他只是点了点头，继续往花园里走，罗恩和赫敏跟在后面。埋着多比的红色土丘就在前方，哈利朝它走去，额头的疼痛愈发剧烈。现在他需要用巨大的努力来关闭闯入脑海的景象，但他知道只需再忍耐一小会儿，很快他就会放弃，他必须去验证自己的推理是否正确。他必须再坚持片刻，好向罗恩和赫敏解释。">查看中文翻译</div>
