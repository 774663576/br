<div class="line_en">Rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings about her, as I take no particular precautions. If she'd wanted me dead, all she would have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needling me, at the very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us can't win these Games. But since the odds are still against either of us surviving, I manage to ignore the thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">Besides, I'm distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy their food. I'm pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. Traditionally, the Career tributes' strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there. The years when they have not protected it well -- one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a Gamemakers' flood washed it away -- those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won. That the Careers have been better fed growing up is actually to their disadvantage, because they don't know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue and I do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，我仍琢磨着职业选手和他们的补给品。不管怎样，露露和我必须想出办法毁了他们的补给品，我敢肯定找吃的对他们来说极为困难。一般来讲，以往的职业选手都是先抢到吃的，然后再对别人发起攻击。有的年份，他们没保护好食物，例如有一年一些凶猛的爬行动物吃掉了他们的食物，还有一年，大赛组织者设计的洪水把食物冲走了；而这样的时候，往往其他区的选手获胜。职业选手从小衣食无忧实际上成为他们的弱势，因为他们不知饥饿时该如何应对。在这点上与露露和我不同。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boom of the cannon jolts me awake. The sky's streaked with light, the birds already chattering. Rue perches in a branch across from me, her hands cupping something. We wait, listening for more shots, but there aren't any.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得那会是谁呢？”我禁不住想起了皮塔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I'm too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight. My wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the venom, and the warmth of Rue at my side, her head cradled on my shoulder, have given me a sense of security. I realize, for the first time, how very lonely I've been in the arena. How comforting the presence of another human being can be. I give in to my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn. Tomorrow, it's the Careers who will have to watch their backs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我太累了，今晚无法做出详细计划。我的伤势已有所缓解，但因为蜂毒的缘故大脑还有些昏沉。露露躺在我身边，头枕在我肩上，让我有种安全感，我第一次觉得这些日子在竞技场我是多么的孤独，身边躺着另一个人多舒服啊！我睡意蒙咙，明天会有办法的。到了明天，惶惶不安的就该是那伙职业选手了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It'd be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the Careers, which means they've recovered enough to be back in the Games. We each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit leg and some berries. It's a good breakfast anywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟蛋做熟了很好吃，可我们俩谁也不愿意冒险生火。我猜想今天的死者是职业选手的牺牲品，这也就是说他们已经恢复得相当不错，可以返回比赛了。我们把鸟蛋吸空，吃了些兔子腿和浆果。不管怎么说，这顿早饭挺不错的。">查看中文翻译</div>

She's only been in to spy on them briefly, but she's observant. They have set up their camp beside the lake. Their supply stash is about thirty yards away. During the day, they've been leaving another tribute, the boy from District 3, to watch over the supplies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们并没有打到很多猎物，我一直在问露露职业选手的情况，心思都放在这上面了。她不久前刚窥探完他们的情况，她观察得很细。他们的营地在湖边，隐藏补给的地方距他们大约三十码。白天，他们会留下一个三区的男孩来看守补给品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we devise a strategy in hushed voices. And I come to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who gives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves most in the world, replies, of all things, "Music."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一边低声商量着该怎么办，一边挖草根，摘浆果和野菜。我对露露的了解也更多了，她是六个姊妹中的老大，很爱护自己的弟弟妹妹，把自己的口粮给他们吃，她到草地挖野菜吃，她们区的治安警可没我们区的好说话。当问起她最喜爱的是什么时，她的回答是“音乐”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm usually up highest, so I'm the first to see the flag that signals quitting time. There's a special little song I do," says Rue. She opens her mouth and sings a little four-note run in a sweet, clear voice. "And the mockingjays spread it around the orchard. That's how everyone knows to knock off," she continues. "They can be dangerous though, if you get too near their nests. But you can't blame them for that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一般是爬得最高的那个，所以第一个看到收工的旗子，之后我就唱个特别的小曲。”说着，她张开嘴用清晰甜美的嗓音唱了一个四音符的小曲。“嘲笑鸟把小曲传遍整个果林，这样大家就都知道该歇工了。”她接着说道，“可要是你靠近它的鸟窝也很危险，但这也不能怪它们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. "Here, you take it. It has more meaning for you than me."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, no," says Rue, closing my fingers back over the pin. "I like to see it on you. That's how I decided I could trust you. Besides, I have this." She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved wooden star. Or maybe it's a flower. "It's a good luck charm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，不行，”露露说，把我伸开的手合上，“我很喜欢你戴着它，就为这个我才觉得可以相信你，另外，我还有这个。”她从衬衫里掏出一个用草编的项链，上面挂着一颗星星，也许是一朵花，“它会带来好运的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I don't see any other tributes, but I do notice some of the things Rue has mentioned. Patches of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves that healed my stings.

<div class="line_en">When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, I pause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this point. Remember, I tell myself. You're the hunter now, not them. I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness. It's right at the edge of the wood, but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the Career camp without being spotted. Between us lies the flat expanse where the Games began.</div>

<div class="line_en">There are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato and the girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy who must be from District 3. He made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the Capitol. I can remember almost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training score, not his interview.

<div class="line_en">The Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its insides have been picked clean. Most of the supplies, held in crates, burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp. Others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the onset of the Games. A canopy of netting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself.</div>

One thing's for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks. Some other factor is at play here, and I'd better stay put until I figure out what it is. My guess is the pyramid is booby-trapped in some manner. I think of concealed pits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart.

<div class="line_en">There's no alternative. I'm going to have to get in closer and see if I can't discover what exactly protects the supplies. In fact, I'm just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye. Several hundred yards to my right, I see someone emerge from the woods. For a second, I think it's Rue, but then I recognize Foxface -- she's the one we couldn't remember this morning -- creeping out onto the plain. When she decides it's safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly, sometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing happens. In a moment, she's regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies.</div>

<div class="line_en">So, I'm right about the booby trap, but it's clearly more complex than I had imagined. I was right about the girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her pack, taking a few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each, not enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then she's doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, safe and sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么说我对里面布设了陷阱的猜测是对的，但情况显然比我预想的要复杂。我对这个女孩的猜测也是对的，她非常狡猾，找到了通向补给品的路径并且这么轻而易举地走了进去。她往自己的背包里塞满了东西，各样都拿一点，从板条箱里拿一些饼干，从挂在一条绳索上的麻袋里拿几个苹果，这样就不会有人发现丢了东西，引起怀疑。然后她又小步从圈子里蹦出来，飞奔入丛林，毫发无伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My arm's pretty good, I might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what? Maybe one mine? That could start a chain reaction. Or could it? Would the boy from District 3 have placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not disturb the others? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one mine, I'd draw the Careers back down on me for sure. And anyway, what am I thinking? There's that net, clearly strung to deflect any such attack. Besides, what I'd really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reaction, demolishing the whole lot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的胳膊很有劲，也许我可以扔几块石头进去，那能触发什么？也许一个地雷，那样就能引起连锁反应，会吗？三区的男孩在埋地雷时，是不是只设计成能触发单个地雷而不影响其他几个？这样就能保住补给品，又能把入侵者炸死。就算我引爆了一个地雷，也会把所有的职业选手招回来。我该怎么办呢？那里还有网子，显然是为了阻止这类的袭击，事实上，我需要一下子扔进去三十几块石头，引发大面积连环爆炸，才能同时摧毁一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting one over on them, but what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, I can't go strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky-high. As for sending in a burning arrow, that's more laughable than ever. The mines are set off by pressure. It doesn't have to be a lot, either. One year, a girl dropped her token, a small wooden ball, while she was at her plate, and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，三区的男孩真了不起，对他们的陈规发起挑战，可我现在该怎么办？显然，我不可能走进去而完好无损。至于发射带火的箭头就更可笑了。地雷是靠压力触发的，当然压力也无需太大。有一年，一个女孩站在圆盘上时，把本区的纪念物，一个小木盒掉在地上，就被炸飞了，最后人们不得不在地面捡起她的尸体碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally. I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena. The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down. The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reactivate them. I've never seen anyone in the Games do that. I bet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is a solution to this, I know there is, if I can only focus hard enough. I stare at the pyramid, the bins, the crates, too heavy to topple over with an arrow. Maybe one contains cooking oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin, since I'd just be guessing. I'm genuinely thinking of trying to re-create Foxface's trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples. I could sever the rope in one shot, didn't I do as much in the Training Center? It's a big bag, but it still might only be good for one explosion. If only I could free the apples themselves…</div>
