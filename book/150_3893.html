<div class="line_en">He was very reserved. All she knew about his antecedents, his birth, his education, and his life before he met her, she had elicited by direct questioning. It was odd, the only thing that seemed to annoy him was a question; and when, in her natural curiosity, she fired a string of them at him, his answers became at every one more abrupt. She had the wit to see that he did not care to reply not because he had anything to hide from her, but merely from a natural secretiveness. It bored him to talk about himself. It made him shy and uncomfortable. He did not know how to be open. He was fond of reading, but he read books which seemed to Kitty very dull. If he was not busy with some scientific treatise he would read books about China or historical works. He never relaxed. She did not think he could. He was fond of games: he played tennis and bridge.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fact was, of course, that he had no charm. That was why he was not popular, and she had not been long in Hong Kong before she discovered that he was not. She remained very vague about his work. It was enough for her to realize, and she did this quite distinctly, that to be the government bacteriologist was no great fry. He seemed to have no desire to discuss that part of his life with her. Because she was willing to be interested in anything at first she had asked him about it. He put her off with a jest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，关键是他毫无魅力可言。这就是他到处不受欢迎的原因，刚到香港没多久她就发现了这一点。对他的工作她一向知之甚少。她很清楚政府的细菌学专家不是什么大人物，知道这点就足够了。他似乎也无意跟她谈论工作上的事。起初她对他的工作颇感兴趣，曾经试图过问。他开个玩笑搪塞了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wondered why he had ever fallen in love with her. She could not imagine any one less suited than herself to this restrained, cold, and self-possessed man. And yet it was quite certain that he loved her madly. He would do anything in the world to please her. He was like wax in her hands. When she thought of one side he showed her a side which only she had seen, she despised him a little. She wondered whether his sarcastic manner, with its contemptuous tolerance for so many persons and thing: she admired, was merely a facade to conceal a profound weakness. She supposed he was clever, everyone seemed to think he was, but except very occasionally when he was with two or three people he liked and was in the mood, she had never found him entertaining. He did not precisely bore her, he left her indifferent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她奇怪他怎么会爱上她。任何人都要比她更适合这个保守、冷漠、自制的男人。然而事实是他就是那么地爱她，为了她他愿意做任何事。他就像她手里的牵线木偶。她回想起平时他在大家眼中的言行，不免对他心生鄙视。她怀疑他一贯的嘲讽态度和对她的聊友和热衷的玩乐所抱有的轻蔑，其实都是在遮掩他内心的虚弱。她觉得他的脑子足够聪明，大家也都抱以认同，然而除了少有地跟他喜欢的两三个人在一块儿并来了兴头时，就再也见不到他与人闲谈玩乐了。她不会对他感到厌倦，他们根本不在一个圈子里。">查看中文翻译</div>
