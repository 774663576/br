<div class="line_en">Not long after the dancing had begun at the party, Marian Almond came up to introduce Catherine to a tall young man. She told Catherine that the young man very much wanted to meet her, and that he was a cousin of Arthur Townsend, the man she was engaged to.</div>

<div class="line_en">The music, which had been silent for a while, suddenly began again. He smiled and asked her to dance. Catherine gave no answer, she simply let him put his arm around her, and in a moment they were dancing around the room. When they paused, she felt that she was red, and then, for some moments, she stopped looking at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="音乐停了一会儿之后又突然响了起来。他微笑着请她跳舞。凯瑟琳没回答，只是任由他用胳膊搂住自己，不一会儿他们就在房中翩翩起舞了。他们休息的时候，她感到脸都红了，后来有一段时间，她不再看他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catherine always felt uncomfortable when meeting new people. The young man, Mr Morris Townsend, was very handsome, and when Marian went away, Catherine stood in front of him, not knowing what to say. But before she could get embarrassed, Mr Townsend began to talk to her with an easy smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯瑟琳遇到生人的时候总是觉得不自在。这个叫莫里斯·汤森的年轻人长得很英俊，玛丽安走开后，凯瑟琳站在他面前，不知道该说些什么好。不过还没等她感到尴尬，汤森先生就已经带着轻松的笑容和她聊起天来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Townsend looked straight into Catherine's eyes. She answered nothing; she only listened, and looked at him.

<div class="line_en">He told her that he was a distant cousin of Arthur Townsend, and Arthur had brought him to introduce him to the family. In fact, he was a stranger in New York -- he had not been there for many years. He had been travelling around the world, living in many strange places, and had only come back a month or two before. New York was very pleasant, but he felt lonely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉她自己是阿瑟·汤森的远房表兄，阿瑟带他过来，把他介绍给这家人。实际上，他对纽约还很陌生一一他有好多年没来过这里了。他一直在世界各地旅行，在很多陌生的地方生活过，直到一两个月前才回来。纽约是一个很快乐的地方，但他却感到孤独。">查看中文翻译</div>
