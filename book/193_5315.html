<div class="line_en">Gunther Glick and Chinita Macri sat parked in the BBC van in the shadows at the far end of Piazza del Popolo. They had arrived shortly after the four Alpha Romeos, just in time to witness an inconceivable chain of events. Chinita still had no idea what it all meant, but she'd made sure the camera was rolling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘瑟．葛立克和雪妮塔．梅可瑞把BBC的厢型车停在人民广场远端的阴影下，两人坐在车上。那四辆爱快罗密欧到达后不久，他们也到了，刚好赶上目睹一连串难以置信的事件发生。雪妮塔还是不晓得这些事情代表什麽意义，但她很确定手上的摄影机都拍下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as they'd arrived, Chinita and Glick had seen a veritable army of young men pour out of the Alpha Romeos and surround the church. Some had weapons drawn. One of them, a stiff older man, led a team up the front steps of the church. The soldiers drew guns and blew the locks off the front doors. Macri heard nothing and figured they must have had silencers. Then the soldiers entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪妮塔和葛立克才刚到，就看见一群由年轻男子组成的、名副其实的军队，从四辆爱快罗密欧裡涌出来，包围了教堂，有的还掏出了武器。其中一个较为年长的高挺男子率领一组人爬上教堂前的阶梯，士兵掏出枪来轰掉了前门的锁。梅可瑞没听到什麽声音，猜想他们一定装了灭音器。然后那些士兵进入教堂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chinita had recommended they sit tight and film from the shadows. After all, guns were guns, and they had a clear view of the action from the van. Glick had not argued. Now, across the piazza, men moved in and out of the church. They yelled to each other. Chinita adjusted her camera to follow a team as they searched the surrounding area. All of them, though dressed in civilian clothes, seemed to move with military precision. "Who do you think they are?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪妮塔建议他们就坐在车内，躲在暗处拍摄。毕竟人家手裡拿的可是枪，而他们从厢型车上又可以把所有动静看得一清二楚。葛立克没反对。此时，在广场那头，那些人进出教堂，彼此喊著话。雪妮塔调整摄影机，拍摄一组人搜索周围区域的画面。那些人虽然全穿著便衣，但举动似乎都有著军人的一板一眼。「你想他们会是什麽人？」她问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chinita wasn't sure what to say. There was obviously something going on here, but she had been in journalism long enough to know that there was often a very dull explanation for interesting events. "This could be nothing," she said. "These guys could have gotten the same tip you got and are just checking it out. Could be a false alarm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪妮塔不确定该说什麽。这裡显然出了什麽事，但她待在新闻界够久，晓得很多有趣的事件背后的解释其实非常无趣。「这说不定没什麽。」她说。「这些人可能接到跟你一样的爆料，只是来这边检查一下。搞不好是假情报。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Robert Langdon dashed down the stairs outside the church and into the middle of the piazza. It was getting dark now, the springtime sun setting late in southern Rome. The sun had dropped below the surrounding buildings, and shadows streaked the square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗柏．兰登衝下教堂外的阶梯，来到广场上。现在天色渐黑，南罗马的春天日落得比较晚。太阳已经落到周围的建筑物之下，为广场投下一道道长条状的阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned and examined the orientation of the church from which he had just come. He pictured the Chigi Chapel inside, and the sculpture of the angel inside that. Without hesitation he turned due west, into the glow of the impending sunset. Time was evaporating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转身，检查著刚出来那栋教堂的方位，想像著裡面的基吉小圣堂，还有那座天使雕像。然后毫不犹豫转向正西方，面对著日落时分的夕阳光芒。时间正在一点一滴逝去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay, Bernini," he said aloud to himself. "Where the hell is your angel pointing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「好吧，贝尼尼，」他大声自言自语，「你的天使到底指向何方？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Racking his brain, Langdon pictured page after page of Italian art history. Although very familiar with Bernini's work, Langdon knew the sculptor had been far too prolific for any nonspecialist to know all of it. Still, considering the relative fame of the first marker -- Habakkuk and the Angel -- Langdon hoped the second marker was a work he might know from memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登绞尽脑汁，努力回想一页页的义大利艺术史。虽然很熟悉贝尼尼的作品，但兰登知道这位雕塑家实在太多产了，只有专门研究的专家才会晓得他全部的作品。然而，鑑于第一个指标是颇具知名度的《哈巴谷与天使》，兰登还期望下一个指标可能是他凭记忆就想得起来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Southwest," he said, scowling at the shops and apartments blocking his view. "The next marker is out there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「西南方。」他说，对著挡住视线的商店和公寓沉下脸。「下一个指标就在那个方向。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Airis next. Langdon urged himself to think. A Bernini sculpture that has something to do with Air! He was drawing a total blank. Still he felt energized. I'm on the path of Illumination! It is still intact!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一个是气。兰登催自己快想。跟空气有关的贝尼尼的雕塑！他什麽也想不出来。可是仍觉得振奋极了。我就站在光明路径上！这条路径依然完整无缺！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon didn't bite. "We need a map. One that shows all the churches in Rome."</div>

<div class="line_en">Olivetti's whisper was cold. "You sure this time?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧里维提的低语很冷漠。「这回你确定吗？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking southwest, Langdon strained to see a spire or cathedral tower jutting up over the obstacles. He saw nothing. He needed a map. If they could figure out what churches were southwest of here, maybe one of them would spark Langdon's memory. Air, he pressed. Air. Bernini. Sculpture. Air. Think!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登望向西南方，竭力想从眼前的重重障碍中看到一座尖塔或教堂塔楼，但是什麽也没看到。他需要一张地图，如果知道西南方有哪些教堂，或许其中之一能勾起兰登的记忆。气，他逼著自己。空气。贝尼尼。雕塑。空气。快想！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon checked his watch. "We only have half an hour."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="薇多利雅一脸激动。「所以那个天使指著西南边？你不知道西南边有哪些教堂吗？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't see past the damn buildings." Langdon turned and faced the square again. "And I don't know Rome's churches well enou --" He stopped.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon looked out at the piazza again. Having ascended the church stairs, he was now higher, and his view was better. He still couldn't see anything, but he realized he was moving in the right direction. His eyes climbed the tower of rickety scaffolding above him. It rose six stories, almost to the top of the church's rose window, far higher than the other buildings in the square. He knew in an instant where he was headed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登的眼光又越过广场，此时站在教堂阶梯顶端，地势比较高，视野也更远了。他还是什麽都看不见，但明白自己思绪的方向没错。他的眼睛望著头顶上摇摇晃晃的鹰架，总共搭了六层楼高，快到教堂玫瑰窗的顶端了，比广场上的其他建筑物都要高得多。他立刻知道自己接下来该去哪儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
