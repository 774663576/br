<div class="line_en">The community of fowls to which Tess had been appointed as supervisor, purveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend, made its head quarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that had once been a garden, but was now a trampled and sanded square. The house was overrun with ivy, its chimney being enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower. The lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by themselves, and not by certain dusty copy holders who now lay east and west in the churchyard. The descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers' money, and had been in their possession for several generations before the d'Urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently turned into a fowl house by Mrs Stoke-d'Urberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law. ''Twas good enough for Christians in grandfather's time,' they said.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks. Distracted hens in coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate agriculturists.

<div class="line_en">Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took, under her companion's direction, two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures -- feathers floating within view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a white haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges -- one sitting on each arm.</div>

My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person. Well, where are they? Ah, this is Strut! But he is hardly so lively today, is he? He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger, I suppose.

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，你就是那个来帮我照看鸡的姑娘吧？”德贝维尔夫人听见有一种新的脚步声，嘴里说。“我希望你能好好地照顾它们。我的管家告诉我说，你为我照看鸡是最合适的人。好啦，我的鸡在哪儿？哦，这是斯特拉特①！不过它今天不太活泼，是不是？我想因为是一个陌生人带它来，把它吓着啦。凤凰也一样——对。它们都有点害怕——你们是不是有点儿害怕，我的宝贝？不过它们很快就会熟悉你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had been submitted to the old woman -- Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins, Brahmas, Dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just then -- her perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the bird upon her knees.</div>

<div class="line_en">While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap, and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks, their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover if a single feather were crippled or dragged. She handled their crops, and knew what they had eaten, and if too little or too much; her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d'Urberville was the bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the maidservant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up. At the end of the ceremony Mrs d'Urberville abruptly asked Tess, wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations, 'Can you whistle?'</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and the birds were taken back to their quarters. The girl's surprise at Mrs d'Urberville's manner was not great; for since seeing the size of the house she had expected no more. But she was far from being aware that the old lady had never heard a word of the so-called kinship. She gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman and her son. But in that, too, she was mistaken. Mrs d'Urberville was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully, and to be bitterly fond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝想象中的亲戚对她的接见就这样结束了，那些鸡也被送回到它们的院子里。对德贝维尔夫人的态度，苔丝并不怎样感到奇怪；因为自从见到了这座庄园的规模以后，她就没有抱什么奢望。但是她一点儿也不知道，关于所谓的亲戚的事，老夫人却没有听说过一个字。她猜想那个瞎眼的老妇人和她的儿子之间没有什么感情交流。不过关于这一点，她也猜猎了。天下带着怨恨爱孩子和带着伤心疼孩子的母亲，德贝维尔夫人并不是第一个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the sun shone, now that she was once installed there; and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her, so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post. As soon as she was alone within the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop, and seriously screwed up her mouth for the long neglected practice. She found her former ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the lips, and no clear note at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管头一天一开始就叫人不痛快，但是既然她已经在这儿安置下来，所以当早晨太阳照耀时，她就爱上了她的新工作的自由和新奇；她想试试老夫人对她作的出人意料的吩咐，检验一下自己的能力，以便确定保不保得住她得到的这个工作机会。当苔丝回到围墙的院子里只剩下一个人时，她就在一个鸡笼上坐下来，认真地把嘴巴撮起来，开始了她早已生疏了的练习。她发现她吹口哨的能力已经退化了，只能从撮起的嘴唇中吹出一阵阵空洞的风声，根本就吹不成清楚的音调。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing, wondering how she could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature, till she became aware of a movement among the ivy-boughs which cloaked the garden-wall no less than the cottage.

<div class="line_en">It was in the economy of this regime that Tess Durbeyfield had undertaken to fill a place. Her first day's experiences were fairly typical of those which followed through many succeeding days. A familiarity with Alec d'Urberville's presence -- which that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by lastingly calling her his cousin when they were alone -- removed much of her original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind. But she was more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her, owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother, and, through that lady's comparative helplessness, upon him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs d'Urberville slept in a large four-post bedstead hung with heavy damask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment, where they flitted about freely at certain hours, and made little white spots on the furniture and upholstery. Once while Tess was at the window where the cages were ranged, giving her lesson as usual, she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed. The old lady was not present, and turning round the girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the curtains. Thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of his presence. She searched the curtains every morning after that, but never found anybody within them. Alec d'Urberville had evidently thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德贝维尔夫人睡在一张大四柱床上，床上挂着厚实的锦缎帐子，红腹灰雀也养在同一间房里，在一定的时间里它们可以在房里自由自在地飞来飞去，把家具和垫子上弄得到处都是白色的小点。有一次，苔丝站在挂着一排鸟笼子的窗户像往常一样教小鸟儿唱歌时，她觉得她听见床后有一种细小的摩擦声。那个老太太当时不在，姑娘转过身去，在她的印象中好像看见帐沿下有一双靴子的尖头。因此，她吹的口哨立刻就乱了调子，如果真的有人的话，那么那个人也肯定发现苔丝怀疑到他的存在了。自此以后，她每天早晨都要搜查一遍帐子，但是从来没有发现有人在那儿。显然阿历克·德贝维尔已经完全想到了他的怪诞行为，如果他用那种埋伏的把戏，肯定要把苔丝吓坏的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs d'Urberville's room was no such onerous business when she had regained the art, for she had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those songsters admirably. A far more satisfactory time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning. Unrestrained by the young man's presence she threw up her mouth, put her lips near the bars, and piped away in easeful grace to the attentive listeners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她恢复了吹口哨的技艺的时候，不久她就发现，在德贝维尔夫人的屋子里，对着红腹灰雀吹口哨并不是十分繁重的事，因为她从她的善于唱歌的母亲那儿学会的大量曲调，对那些歌喉婉转的鸟儿非常合适。同当初在院子里练习吹口哨相比，现在每天早晨站在鸟笼子旁边吹这种口哨，的确是叫人满意快乐的了。那个青年不在身边，她感到无拘无束，就撅起嘴巴，靠近鸟笼子，对着那些留神细听的小鸟儿轻松优美地吹起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
