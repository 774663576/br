<div class="line_en">It all started the summer before second grade when our moving van pulled into her neighborhood. And since we're now about done with the eighth grade, that, my friend, makes more than half a decade of strategic avoidance and social discomfort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都从二年级前的那个暑假，当我们的搬家卡车开进她的街区开始。现在我们已经快读完八年级了，所以，我的朋友，这简直是超过五年的“战术性回避”和“社交恐惧”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't just barge into my life. She barged and shoved and wedged her way into my life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Did we invite her to get into our moving van and start climbing all over boxes? No! But that's exactly what she did, taking over and showing off like only Juli Baker can.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the beginning of my soon-to-become-acute awareness that the girl cannot take a hint. Of any kind. Does she zip on home like a kid should when they've been invited to leave? No. She says, "Oh, my mom knows where I am. She said it was fine." Then she points across the street and says, "We just live right over there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我立即意识到这个女孩就是不识趣，在各种情况下。她不是应该像其他小孩一样在被要求离开时立刻乖乖回家吗？没有，她说，“哦，我妈妈知道我在哪儿。她说没关系。”然后她指着街道对面说道：“我们就住在那儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My father looks to where she's pointing and mutters, "Oh boy." Then he looks at me and winks as he says, "Bryce, isn't it time for you to go inside and help your mother?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我爸爸看着她指的地方嘟囔到：“哦，天！”然后他对着我一边眨眼一边说：“布莱斯，现在不是你去帮助妈妈的时间吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knew right off that this was a ditch play. And I didn't think about it until later, but ditch wasn't a play I'd run with my dad before. Face it, pulling a ditch is not something discussed with dads. It's like, against parental law to tell your kid it's okay to ditch someone, no matter how annoying or muddy they might be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立刻就明白这是个逃跑游戏。这个游戏我可从没和爸爸玩过，虽然我当时没想到这一点。想想看，逃跑可不是你会和爸爸讨论的事。这就像，违背了父母的原则去告诉孩子甩开一个人并没有关系，无论那个人有多么烦人讨厌。">查看中文翻译</div>

There I was, holding the mud monkey's hand!</div>

<div class="line_en">My troubles were far from over, though. Every day she came back, over and over again. "Can Bryce play?" I could hear her asking from my hiding place behind the couch. "Is he ready yet?" One time she even cut across the yard and looked through my window. I spotted her in the nick of time and dove under my bed, but man, that right there tells you something about Juli Baker. She's got no concept of personal space. No respect for privacy. The world is her playground, and watch out below -- Juli's on the slide!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我的麻烦远没有结束。每一天她都会过来，一次又一次。“布莱斯能出来玩吗？”我可以听见她就站在离我藏身的沙发不远处发问。“他准备好了吗？”有一次她甚至穿过了院子偷窥我房间的窗户。我在紧要关头躲进了床底下，但是，你可以立即发现朱莉的特点了。她根本没有“个人空间”的概念。一点都不尊重私隐。整个世界就是她的游乐场，往下看看，朱莉在里头自由玩耍！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lucky for me, my dad was willing to run block. And he did it over and over again. He told her I was busy or sleeping or just plain gone. He was a lifesaver.</div>

<div class="line_en">I used to knock-down-drag-out with her, but it's just not worth it. Girls don't fight fair. They pull your hair and gouge you and pinch you; then they run off gasping to mommy when you try and defend yourself with a fist. Then you get locked into time-out, and for what? No, my friend, the secret is, don't snap at the bait. Let it dangle. Swim around it. Laugh it off. After a while they'll give up and try to lure someone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我经常和她“撞、击、拖、拉”，但是一点儿都不值得。女孩们从来不公平地打架。她们拉你的头发，挠你还有掐你；然后当你想要用拳头防卫的时候，她们抢先跑到妈妈面前告状。再然后你会被禁足在房间，为了什么？不，我的朋友，秘密就是，别咬住诱饵。就让它吊在那儿，在它周围游来游去，一笑置之。没过一会儿她们就会自动放弃，再去试图引诱别人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At least that's the way it is with Lynetta. And the bonus of having her as a pain-in-the-rear sister was figuring out that this method works on everyone. Teachers, jerks at school, even Mom and Dad. Seriously. There's no winning arguments with your parents, so why get all pumped up over them? It is way better to dive down and get out of the way than it is to get clobbered by some parental tidal wave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少这对琳内塔有用。而且有她这样一个姐姐的好处就是我发现了这个办法对任何人都有用。老师，学校的混混，甚至父母。说真的，你从来没有机会赢任何一场与父母的战争，所以为什么要开战呢？潜入水下可比被父母射来的巨浪淹没要好多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The funny thing is, Lynetta's still clueless when it comes to dealing with Mom and Dad. She goes straight into thrash mode and is too busy drowning in the argument to take a deep breath and dive for calmer water. And she thinks I'm stupid.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, true to form, Lynetta tried to bait me with Juli those first few days. She even snuck her past Dad once and marched her all around the house, hunting me down.

A few minutes later I heard Dad yell at Juli to get off the antique furniture, and once again, she got booted.</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't think I went outside that whole first week. I helped unpack stuff and watched TV and just kind of hung around while my mom and dad arranged and rearranged the furniture, debating whether Empire settees and French Rococo tables should even be put in the same room.</div>

<div class="line_en">So believe me, I was dying to go outside. But every time I checked through the window, I could see Juli showing off in her yard. She'd be heading a soccer ball or doing high kicks with it or dribbling it up and down their driveway. And when she wasn't busy showing off, she'd just sit on the curb with the ball between her feet, staring at our house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以相信我，我非常想出门。但是每一次我从窗户望过去，都能看到朱莉在她的院子里自我炫耀。她会用头顶球或者踢高球，或者沿着他们的车道运球。当她不忙着炫耀的时候，她会把球夹在两脚之间，坐在路边死死盯着我们的房子。">查看中文翻译</div>

That way, anytime Juli was around, all I'd have to do was hang a little closer to Shelly and things would just naturally take care of themselves. What happened, though, is that Shelly took things way too seriously. She went around telling everybody -- including Juli -- that we were in love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想到的是雪莉可以和我们同桌吃饭，然后也许可以和我一起散散步。用这样的方法，每一次只要朱莉在场，我只需要离雪莉近一点，接下来所有的事情都会自然发展。但是事实呢，雪莉实在太认真了。她告诉了所有人——包括朱莉——我们爱上了对方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In no time Juli and Shelly got into some kind of catfight, and while Shelly was recovering from that, my supposed friend Garrett -- who had been totally behind this plan -- told her what I was up to. He's always denied it, but I've since learned that his code of honor is easily corrupted by weepy females.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久朱莉和雪莉就发生了激烈的战争，当雪莉终于又恢复过来的时候，我所谓的朋友加瑞特——他完全知道这个计划——告诉了雪莉我的计划。他每一次都否认，但是从那以后我了解到他的原则在眼泪汪汪的女生面前根本不堪一击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And you can blame that on our teacher, Mr. Mertins. He stuck Juli to me like glue.

Add all the extra credit she does to an already perfect score, and I swear she's never gotten less than 120 percent in any subject.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的手总是最先举起来；她的答案就像是完整的专题论文；她的课题总是先交上去，并且把它作为反对其余学生的武器，老师总是把她的课题举得高高的说，“这才是我所期望的，同学们。这是个能得优秀的例子。”把她所有多得的学分加起来她可以拿到个满分，而且我发誓她从来没有在任何一个学科上低于120分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But after Mr. Mertins stuck Juli right next to me, her annoying knowledge of all subjects far and wide came in handy. See, suddenly Juli's perfect answers, written in perfect cursive, were right across the aisle, just an eye-shot away. You wouldn't believe the number of answers I snagged from her. I started getting A's and B's on everything! It was great!</div>

<div class="line_en">Juli'd always been sly about sniffing, which really bugged me because no one ever noticed her doing it, but she was just as sly about giving me answers, which was okay by me. The bad thing about it was that I started counting on her spelling in my ear. I mean, why study when you don't have to, right? But after a while, taking all those answers made me feel sort of indebted to her. How can you tell someone to bug off or quit sniffing you when you owe them? It's, you know, wrong.</div>
