<div class="line_cn" title="“这里出了什么事？出了什么事？”费尔奇无疑是被马尔福的喊声吸引过来的，他用肩膀挤过人群。接着，他看见了洛丽丝夫人，他跌跌撞撞地后退几步，惊恐地用手抓住自己的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they entered Lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.</div>

<div class="line_en">The tip of Dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris's fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多长长的鹰钩鼻的鼻尖几乎碰到了洛丽丝夫人身上的毛。他透过半月形的眼镜片仔细端详着它，修长的手指轻轻地这里戳戳，那里捅捅。麦格教授弯着腰，脸也差不多碰到猫了，眯着眼睛细细地看着。斯内普站在他们后面，半个身子藏在阴影里，显得阴森森的。他脸上的表情十分古怪：就好像在拼命克制自己不要笑出来。洛哈特在他们周围徘徊，不停地出谋划策。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture -- I've seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn't there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Lockhart's comments were punctuated by Filch's dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛哈特的话被费尔奇无泪的伤心哭泣打断了。费尔奇瘫坐在桌旁的一张椅子上，用手捂着脸，不敢看洛丽丝夫人。哈利尽管不喜欢费尔奇，但此刻也忍不住对他产生了一些同情，不过他更同情的是他自己。如果邓布利多相信了费尔奇的话，他肯定会被开除。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“也许，波特和他的朋友只是不该在那个时间出现在那个地方，”斯内普说道，嘴唇扭动着露出一丝讥笑，仿佛他对此深表怀疑，“但我们确实遇到了一系列的疑点。他们究竟为什么要到上面的走廊去呢？他们为什么没有参加万圣节的宴会？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot.

<div class="line_en">For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like "breathing loudly' and "looking happy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接连好几天，学生们都不谈别的，整天议论洛丽丝夫人遭到攻击的事。费尔奇的表现使大家时时刻刻忘不了这件事。他经常在洛丽丝夫人遇害的地方踱来踱去，似乎以为攻击者还会再来。哈利看见他用“斯科尔夫人牌万能神奇去污剂”擦洗墙上的文字，但是白费力气，那些文字仍然那么明亮地在石墙上闪烁。费尔奇如果不在犯罪现场巡逻，便瞪着两只红通通的眼睛，偷偷隐蔽在走廊里，然后突然扑向毫无防备的学生，千方百计找借口关他们禁闭，比如说他们“喘气声太大”，或“嘻皮笑脸”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris," Ron told her bracingly. "Honestly, we're much better off without her." Ginny's lip trembled. "Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts," Ron assured her. "They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled. I'm only joking --" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.</div>
