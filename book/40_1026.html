<div class="line_en">Mariam loved having visitors at the kolba. The village arbab and his gifts, Bibi jo and her aching hip and endless gossiping, and, of course, Mullah Faizullah. But there was no one, no one, that Mariam longed to see more than Jalil.</div>

<div class="line_en">The anxiety set in on Tuesday nights. Mariam would sleep poorly, fretting that some business entanglement would prevent Jalil from coming on Thursday, that she would have to wait a whole other week to see him. On Wednesdays, she paced outside, around the kolba, tossed chicken feed absentmindedly into the coop. She went for aimless walks, picking petals from flowers and batting at the mosquitoes nibbling on her arms. Finally, on Thursdays, all she could do was sit against a wall, eyes glued to the stream, and wait. If Jalil was running late, a terrible dread filled her bit by bit. Her knees would weaken, and she would have to go somewhere and lie down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam would leap to her feet when she spotted him hopping stones across the stream, all smiles and hearty waves. Mariam knew that Nana was watching her, gauging her reaction, and it always took effort to stay in the doorway, to wait, to watch him slowly make his way to her, to not run to him. She restrained herself, patiently watched him walk through the tall grass, his suit jacket slung over his shoulder, the breeze lifting his red necktie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当见到他踏着石块穿过溪流，玛丽雅姆会一下子跳起来，露出灿烂的笑容，兴奋地挥舞着手臂。玛丽雅姆知道娜娜一直在看着她，观察她的反应。可是想不向他奔去，而是留在门口等待着、看着他慢慢向她走过来太难了。她约束自己，耐心地看着他走过那片高高的杂草，他的西装衫甩在肩膀上，和风吹拂起他的红领带。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suspended in the air, Mariam would see Jalil's upturned face below her, his wide, crooked smile, his widow's peak, his cleft chin -- a perfect pocket for the tip of her pinkie -- his teeth, the whitest in a town of rotting molars. She liked his trimmed mustache, and she liked that no matter the weather he always wore a suit on his visits -- dark brown, his favorite color, with the white triangle of a handkerchief in the breast pocket -- and cuff links too, and a tie, usually red, which he left loosened. Mariam could see herself too, reflected in the brown of Jalil's eyes: her hair billowing, her face blazing with excitement, the sky behind her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="悬在半空的玛丽雅姆能够见到扎里勒在她身下仰起的脸，弯弯的微笑，额头的发尖，下巴上因为笑而出现的酒窝——正好可以容下她的指尖，还有他的牙齿。这个地方的人都蛀牙，他的牙齿算是最白的了。她喜欢他那修剪得很齐整的胡子，她也喜欢他不管天气怎么样，每次来都穿着一套西装——暗棕色的，他最喜欢的颜色，胸前的口袋放着折成三角形的白色手帕——打着袖钉，系着领带。领带通常是红色的，系得松松垮垮。玛丽雅姆也能看到自己，她的样子反照在扎里勒棕色的眼睛中：她的头发飘扬着，脸上散发着兴奋的光芒，天空在她身后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nana said that one of these days he would miss, that she, Mariam, would slip through his fingers, hit the ground, and break a bone. But Mariam did not believe that Jalil would drop her. She believed that she would always land safely into her father's clean, well-manicured hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="娜娜说迟早有一天他会失手，她，玛丽雅姆，会从他的手指间溜下来，掉在地上，摔断一根骨头。但玛丽雅姆相信扎里勒不会让她摔下来。她相信她总是能够安然无恙地降落在父亲干净的、指甲修剪得整整齐齐的双手中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite her rants against him when he wasn't around, Nana was subdued and mannerly when Jalil visited. Her hair was always washed. She brushed her teeth, wore her best hijab for him. She sat quietly on a chair across from him, hands folded on her lap. She did not look at him directly and never used coarse language around him. When she laughed, she covered her mouth with a fist to hide the bad tooth.</div>

<div class="line_en">They sat outside the kolba, in the shade, and Nana served them tea. Jalil and she acknowledged each other with an uneasy smile and a nod. Jalil never brought up Nana's rock throwing or her cursing.</div>

<div class="line_en">After tea with Nana, Mariam and Jalil always went fishing in the stream. He showed her how to cast her line, how to reel in the trout. He taught her the proper way to gut a trout, to clean it, to lift the meat off the bone in one motion. He drew pictures for her as they waited for a strike, showed her how to draw an elephant in one stroke without ever lifting the pen off the paper. He taught her rhymes. Together they sang:</div>

<div class="line_en">Jalil brought clippings from Herat's newspaper, Ittifaq-i Islam, and read from them to her. He was Mariam's link, her proof that there existed a world at large, beyond the kolba, beyond Gul Daman and Herat too, a world of presidents with unpronounceable names, and trains and museums and soccer, and rockets that orbited the earth and landed on the moon, and, every Thursday, Jalil brought a piece of that world with him to the kolba.</div>

<div class="line_en">When it was time for Jalil to leave, Mariam always stood in the doorway and watched him exit the clearing, deflated at the thought of the week that stood, like an immense, immovable object, between her and his next visit.

<div class="line_en">At night, Mariam lay in her cot and wondered what his house in Herat was like. She wondered what it would be like to live with him, to see him every day. She pictured herself handing him a towel as he shaved, telling him when he nicked himself. She would brew tea for him. She would sew on his missing buttons. They would take walks in Herat together, in the vaulted bazaar where Jalil said you could find anything you wanted. They would ride in his car, and people would point and say, "There goes Jalil Khan with his daughter." He would show her the famed tree that had a poet buried beneath it.</div>
