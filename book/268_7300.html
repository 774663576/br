<div class="line_en">Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had a girls' night out, and the estrogen rush was invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while Jessica jabbered on about the boys we hung out with. Jessica's dinner with Mike had gone very well, and she was hoping that by Saturday night they would have progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to myself, pleased. Angela was passively happy to be going to the dance, but not really interested in Eric. Jess tried to get her to confess who her type was, but I interrupted with a question about dresses after a bit, to spare her. Angela threw a grateful glance my way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much more polished and quaint than Forks. But Jessica and Angela knew it well, so they didn't plan to waste time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess drove straight to the one big department store in town, which was a few streets in from the bay area's visitor-friendly face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess was torn between two -- one a long, strapless, basic black number, the other a knee-length electric blue with spaghetti straps. I encouraged her to go with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose a pale pink dress that draped around her tall frame nicely and brought out honey tints in her light brown hair. I complimented them both generously and helped by returning the rejects to their racks. The whole process was much shorter and easier than similar trips I'd taken with Renee at home. I guess there was something to be said for limited choices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰西在两条裙子中挣扎着——一件是长款无肩带的经典黑色礼服，另一件是及膝细肩带的铁蓝色礼服。我推荐她选蓝色那件，为什么不抓住人们的眼球呢？安吉拉选了一条淡粉色裙子，它恰到好处地裹住她纤长的身形，给她浅棕色的头发增添了几分甜美。我毫不吝啬地赞美她们，帮忙把她们不要的衣服挂回衣架上。整个过程比我在家陪蕾妮购物时要短暂和容易得多。我猜想，如果真要说是为什么的话，是因为这里的选择很有限。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dress selection wasn't large, but both of them found a few things to try on. I sat on a low chair just inside the dressing room, by the three-way mirror, trying to control my fuming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里的裙子不算很多，但她们两个都找到了不少值得试穿的衣服。我坐在更衣室里的一张矮脚凳上，靠着那块三面镜，试图控制自己七窍生烟的愤怒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We headed over to shoes and accessories. While they tried things on I merely watched and critiqued, not in the mood to shop for myself, though I did need new shoes.

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，当天气晴好的时候他们会把所有的时间都花在徒步旅行上——甚至包括医生本人。他们都非常喜欢户外活动。”她平静地告诉我，依然在检查她想鞋子。她甚至没有问一个问题，更别提杰西卡会连珠炮似的发问的成百个问题了。我真的开始喜欢安吉拉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We planned to go to dinner at a little Italian restaurant on the boardwalk, but the dress shopping hadn't taken as long as we'd expected. Jess and Angela were going to take their clothes back to the car and then walk down to the bay. I told them I would meet them at the restaurant in an hour -- I wanted to look for a bookstore. They were both willing to come with me, but I encouraged them to go have fun -- they didn't know how preoccupied I could get when surrounded by books; it was something I preferred to do alone. They walked off to the car chattering happily, and I headed in the direction Jess pointed out.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't what I was looking for. The windows were full of crystals, dream-catchers, and books about spiritual healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I could see a fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair worn straight down her back, clad in a dress right out of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behind the counter. I decided that was one conversation I could skip. There had to be a normal bookstore in town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我毫不费力就找到了那家书店，但它并不是我想找的那种书店。橱窗里摆满了水晶球，捕梦网，以及关于精神治疗的书。我甚至不想走进去。透过玻璃，我能看到一个五十岁左右的女人，灰色的头发直直地耷拉在她的背上。她裹着一条六十年代时就已经过时了的裙子，站在柜台后露出热烈欢迎的微笑。我认为我完全可以跳过和她对话这一步。镇上一定还有一家更正常的书店。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I started to realize, as I crossed another road, that I was going the wrong direction. The little foot traffic I had seen was going north, and it looked like the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided to turn east at the next corner, and then loop around after a few blocks and try my luck on a different street on my way back to the boardwalk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我穿过另一条街道时，我开始意识到，我走错方向了。我看到的仅有的几辆车都是往北去的，而这里的建筑看起来更像是仓库。我决定在下一个路口向东走，然后在走了几个街区原地打转，试图碰碰运气，找到另一条走回观光大道的路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I meandered through the streets, which were filling up with end-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was headed toward downtown. I wasn't paying as much attention as I should to where I was going; I was wrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to think about him, and what Angela had said… and more than anything trying to beat down my hopes for Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful than the rest, when I looked up to see someone's silver Volvo parked along the street and it all came crashing down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought to myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我漫步着穿过街道，一心希望自己正在走向闹市区，街上正挤满了下班的车流。我没太留意自己该向哪个方向走去。我正在全力应付着心头的失落。我如此努力地不让自己去想他。而安吉拉所说的…还有更多事情试图击倒我对周六的希望。当我抬头看见别人的银色沃尔沃停在路边时，我感到了一阵更为痛苦的失望，这几乎把我给击垮了。愚蠢，不可靠的吸血鬼，我自忖着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some glass-fronted shops that looked promising. But when I got to them, they were just a repair shop and a vacant space. I still had too much time to go looking for Jess and Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get my mood in hand before I met back up with them. I ran my fingers through my hair a couple of times and took some deep breaths before I continued around the corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我重重地踏着步子，向更南的方向走去，走向几家正面是玻璃墙的，看起来比较可靠的商店。但当我走过去的时候，才发现那只是一家维修店和一间闲置的店面。我还是有很多时间，没有必要现在就回过头去找杰西和安吉拉。而且在跟她们碰头以前，我确实需要把自己的情绪调整好。我用手指捋了几下头发，做了好几次深呼吸，然后继续转过街角。">查看中文翻译</div>

Two of them had paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a heavyset, dark-haired man in his early twenties, seemed to be the one who had spoken. He was wearing a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cut-off jeans, and sandals. He took half a step toward me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，这儿！”当他们经过的时候，其中一个喊道。他只能是在跟我说话，因为周围根本没有别人。我下意识地抬起头，他们中的两个停了下来，另外两个还在慢慢走着。离我最近的那个体格魁梧的黑发男人看上去才二十出头，似乎就是刚刚说话的那人。他穿着一件敞开着的法兰绒衬衣，里面穿着一件肮脏的T恤衫，牛仔裤破破烂烂的，还穿着凉鞋。他向我迈了一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A group of four men turned around the corner I was heading for, dressed too casually to be heading home from the office, but they were too grimy to be tourists. As they approached me, I realized they weren't too many years older than I was. They were joking loudly among themselves, laughing raucously and punching each other's arms. I scooted as far to the inside of the sidewalk as I could to give them room, walking swiftly, looking past them to the corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of several somber-colored warehouses, each with large bay doors for unloading trucks, padlocked for the night. The south side of the street had no sidewalk, only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire protecting some kind of engine parts storage yard. I'd wandered far past the part of Port Angeles that I, as a guest, was intended to see. It was getting dark, I realized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the western horizon, creating an early sunset. The eastern sky was still clear, but graying, shot through with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in the car, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms tightly across my chest. A single van passed me, and then the road was empty.</div>

<div class="line_en">I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quiet when compared to the boisterous noise they'd been making earlier, and it didn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to me. Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. I continued to walk as quickly as I could without actually running, focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards away from me now. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A blue car turned onto the street from the south and drove quickly past me. I thought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated, inhibited, unsure that I was really being pursued, and then it was too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我专注地聆听着他们安静的脚步声，但比起他们之前发出的嘈杂的噪音，这实在是太安静了点。听起来他们也没有任何加速或者靠近我的意思。呼吸，我不得不提醒自己。你不知道他们是不是真的在跟着你。我继续快步走着，速度快得就差没跑起来，专注地盯着现在离我只有几码远的右手边的转角处。我能听到，他们和我依然保持着原来的距离。一辆蓝色的小车从南边开进这条街道，飞快地从我身边开过。我想过跳到车前把它截住，但我犹豫了。我抑制住自己的冲动，是因为不敢确定自己是不是真的被跟踪了。然后，已经太迟了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neither was the dark one who'd spoken to me. I turned my head forward at once, quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather made me shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slung across my body, the way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't get snatched. I knew exactly where my pepper spray was -- still in my duffle bag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, just a twenty and some ones, and I thought about "accidentally" dropping my bag and walking away.

<div class="line_en">I reached the corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only a blind drive to the back of another building. I was half-turned in anticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrow drive, back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next corner, where there was a stop sign. I concentrated on the faint footsteps behind me, deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and I knew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and go sprawling if I tried to go any faster. The footfalls were definitely farther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they were maybe forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staring at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走到拐角处，飞快地瞥了一眼，发现那只是通往另一幢建筑物的断头路。我中途改变了主意。我不得不赶紧改变方向，冲过那条狭窄的车道，然后回到人行道上。这条道路在下一个拐角处中断了。那里有一个停下的标志。我把注意力集中在身后微弱的脚步声上，考虑着要不要逃跑。但是，他们听起来在背后更远的地方，而且我知道无论如何他们都会跑过我的。如果我试图跑快些，我一定会被绊到，然后躺倒在地上。脚步声显然是从后面更远的地方传来的。我冒险飞快地向肩膀后扫了一眼，然后宽慰地看到，他们现在在离我大概有四十英尺的距离。但他们都在盯着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I kept my pace steady, the men behind me falling ever so slightly farther behind with every step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I saw two cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and I exhaled in relief. There would be more people around once I got off this deserted street. I skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我似乎永远也不可能走到拐角处。我尽量让自己的步子踏得稳一些，那两个被我远远地抛在后面的男人每一步都走得那么的轻。也许是他们意识到自己吓着我了，所以感到抱歉。我看见两辆车一路向北开进了我正在前往的那个十字路口，我宽慰地松了口气。等我离开这条荒芜的街道的时候，周围一定会有更多人的。我轻快地跳过拐角，感激地叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我曾经是。”他又摇了摇头。“同样，在另一件事上我也错看你了。你不是一块吸引意外的吸铁石――这个定义太宽泛了。你简直是一块专吸灾难的吸铁石。如果方圆十英里内有任何危险物，它都一定会找到你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I followed you to Port Angeles," he admitted, speaking in a rush. "I've never tried to keep a specific person alive before, and it's much more troublesome than I would have believed. But that's probably just because it's you. Ordinary people seem to make it through the day without so many catastrophes." He paused. I wondered if it should bother me that he was following me; instead I felt a strange surge of pleasure. He stared, maybe wondering why my lips were curving into an involuntary smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一路跟着你到奥翔港。”他承认着，完全收不住话头。“在这之前我从没这样努力地保护过某个特定的人。而且这比我原本相信的还要困难重重。但也可能是因为你，才会这样困难。一般人就算在这里耗上一整天也不会遇上那么多的灾难。”他停了下来。我想知道他跟踪我会不会让我觉得困扰。但相反的，我却感到了一阵奇特的满足感。他注视着我，也许是在怀疑着为什么我的唇瓣会弯起来，情不自禁地微笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was keeping tabs on Jessica, not carefully -- like I said, only you could find trouble in Port Angeles -- and at first I didn't notice when you took off on your own. Then, when I realized that you weren't with her anymore, I went looking for you at the bookstore I saw in her head. I could tell that you hadn't gone in, and that you'd gone south… and I knew you would have to turn around soon. So I was just waiting for you, randomly searching through the thoughts of people on the street -- to see if anyone had noticed you so I would know where you were.
