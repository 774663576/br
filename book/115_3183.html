<div class="line_en">The morning after the bridge party Mrs Van Hopper woke with a sore throat and a temperature of a hundred and two. I rang up her doctor, who came round at once and diagnosed the usual influenza. "You are to stay in bed until I allow you to get up," he told her; "I don't like the sound of that heart of yours, and it won't get better unless you keep perfectly quiet and still. I should prefer", he went on, turning to me, "that Mrs Van Hopper had a trained nurse. You can't possibly lift her. It will only be for a fortnight or so."</div>

<div class="line_en">The nurse would give her injections, and a light massage, and she would have a diet. I left her quite happy after the arrival of the nurse, propped up on pillows with a falling temperature, her best bed-jacket round her shoulders and be-ribboned boudoir cap upon her head. Rather ashamed of my light heart, I telephoned her friends, putting off the small party she had arranged for the evening, and went down to the restaurant for lunch, a good half hour before our usual time. I expected the room to be empty -- nobody lunched generally before one o'clock. It was empty, except for the table next to ours. This was a contingency for which I was unprepared. I thought he had gone to Sospel. No doubt he was lunching early because he hoped to avoid us at one o'clock. I was already half-way across the room and could not go back. I had not seen him since we disappeared in the lift the day before, for wisely he had avoided dinner in the restaurant, possibly for the same reason that he lunched early now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="护士将给她打针，并施以轻微的按摩；她还得按规定食谱进食。护士来后，我就走开了。当时她的体温已开始下降，背靠着叠起的枕头坐在床上，披着她最华贵的睡衣，缀有缎带的闺房小帽覆着脑门，显出心满意足的样子。我松了一口气，可是又因此觉得内疚，怀着这种矛盾的心情，我去给她的朋友打电话，取消原已安排在当夜举行的小型聚会，接着就比平时提前整整一小时到楼下餐厅去吃午饭。我原以为餐厅定然空无一人，因为客人一般都不在一点钟前吃午饭。果然，餐厅里空荡荡的，只是我们的邻桌已有人占了。真是意外！对此我完全没有思想准备。他不是去索斯派尔了吗？毫无疑问，他怕一点钟再碰到我们，这才提前吃午饭。这时我已穿过半个餐厅，没法再扭头往回走了。前一天在电梯口分手之后，我没有再见到过他。因为他很乖觉，未在餐厅吃晚饭。此刻提早吃午饭想来也是出于同样的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought this rather absurd, and protested, but to my surprise she agreed with him. I think she enjoyed the fuss it would create, the sympathy of people, the visits and messages from friends, and the arrival of flowers. Monte Carlo had begun to bore her, and this little illness would make a distraction.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a situation for which I was ill-trained. I wished I was older, different. I went to our table, looking straight before me, and immediately paid the penalty of gaucherie by knocking over the vase of stiff anemones as I unfolded my napkin. The water soaked the cloth, and ran down on to my lap. The waiter was at the other end of the room, nor had he seen. In a second though my neighbour was by my side, dry napkin in hand.</div>

I felt very much ashamed of myself. My manners were atrocious. The only excuse I can make is that I've become boorish through living alone. That's why it's so kind of you to lunch with me today."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你那位朋友怎么啦？”他问。我说她得了流行性感冒。他说：“真糟糕。”过了片刻，他又接着说：“我想那便柬你收到了。我很惭愧，我的举止太不成体统。对此我只能找到一个借口：单身生活使我变成了粗鲁的乡巴佬。所以，你今天跟我共进午餐，我很领情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I'm not being polite," he insisted. "I would like you to have luncheon with me. Even if you had not knocked over that vase so clumsily I should have asked you."

<div class="line_cn" title="“可我不是同你客气，”他并不让步。“我很希望你能同我一起吃午饭。即使你没有冒冒失失地撞翻花瓶，我也会邀请你的。”他大概从我脸上看出狐疑的神情，所以就微笑着往下说：“你不相信我，那也没关系。过来坐下。要是不愿意，咱们不一定要说话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We ate for a while without talking, and I thought of a picture postcard I had bought once at a village shop, when on holiday as a child in the west country. It was the painting of a house, crudely done of course and highly coloured, but even those faults could not destroy the symmetry of the building, the wide stone steps before the terrace, the green lawns stretching to the sea. I paid twopence for the painting -- half my weekly pocket money -- and then asked the wrinkled shop woman what it was meant to be. She looked astonished at my ignorance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps it was the memory of this postcard, lost long ago in some forgotten book, that made me sympathize with his defensive attitude. He resented Mrs Van Hopper and her like with their intruding questions. Maybe there was something inviolate about Manderley that made it a place apart; it would not bear discussion. I could imagine her tramping through the rooms, perhaps paying sixpence for admission, ripping the quietude with her sharp, staccato laugh. Our minds must have run in the same channel, for he began to talk about her.</div>

It seemed to me as though he understood, from my poor description, something of the vibrant personality that had been my father's, and something too of the love my mother had for him, making it a vital, living force, with a spark of divinity about it, so much that when he died that desperate winter, struck down by pneumonia, she lingered behind him for five short weeks and stayed no more. I remember pausing, a little breathless, a little dazed. The restaurant was filled now with people who chatted and laughed to an orchestral background and a clatter of plates, and glancing at the clock above the door I saw that it was two o'clock.

<div class="line_en">"An empty house can be as lonely as a full hotel," he said at length. "The trouble is that it is less impersonal." He hesitated, and for a moment I thought he was going to talk of Manderley at last, but something held him back, some phobia that struggled to the surface of his mind and won supremacy, for he blew out his match and his flash of confidence at the same time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就寂寞而论，一幢空房子，可能并不比一座熙攘喧闹的旅馆强，”他终于说话了。“问题在于那幢房子还不免带点儿个性。”他深吟半晌，我以为这下他终于要谈到曼陀丽了，可是有什么东酉束缚着他，某种病态的恐惧心理挣扎着浮上他的脑海，占了上风。于是，他吹熄火柴，与此同时，方才一闪而过的那点儿自信也烟消云散了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought of the cobbled square in Monaco and the house with the narrow window. I could be off there by three o'clock with my sketchbook and pencil, and I told him as much, a little shyly perhaps, like all untalented persons with a pet hobby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立刻想到摩纳哥那鹅卵石广场，那座带狭窗的房屋。我可以带着素描画本和铅笔在三点前赶到那里。我居然把这些都对他说了，说时也许稍带羞涩，那些虽无才华却喜好某种微不足道的玩意儿的人都这么说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remembered Mrs Van Hopper's warning of the night before about putting myself forward and was embarrassed that he might think my talk of Monaco was a subterfuge to win a lift. It was so blatantly the type of thing that she would do herself, and I did not want him to bracket us together. I had already risen in importance from my lunch with him, for as we got up from the table the little mattre d'hotel rushed forward to pull away my chair. He bowed and smiled -- a total change from his usual attitude of indifference -- picked up my handkerchief that had fallen on the floor, and hoped "mademoiselle had enjoyed her lunch". Even the page-boy by the swing doors glanced at me with respect. My companion accepted it as natural, of course; he knew nothing of the ill-carved ham of yesterday. I found the change depressing, it made me despise myself. I remembered my father and his scorn of superficial snobbery.</div>

<div class="line_en">The attentions of the maitre d'hotel had opened up a train of thought, and as we drank coffee I told him about Blaize, the dressmaker. She had been so pleased when Mrs Van Hopper had bought three frocks, and I, taking her to the lift afterwards, had pictured her working upon them in her own small salon, behind the stuffy little shop, with a consumptive son wasting upon her sofa. I could see her, with tired eyes, threading needles, and the floor covered with snippets of material.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="餐厅侍者领班的殷勤引出一连串的回忆。喝咖啡时，我对他说起那个名叫布莱兹的女裁缝。那一回，范—霍珀夫人定做了三件上衣，女裁缝可乐啦。后来，在送裁缝上电梯去的路上，我曾想象她将如何在那狭小闷塞的工场背后的小客厅里，赶制这几件衣服；生肺病的儿子也许就躺在她身旁的沙发上，日益瞧悴下去。我甚至想象出女裁缝如何眯缝着干涩的眼睛，穿针引线；屋子里衣料的碎片撕了一地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," I said, "I never found out." And I told him how I had rung the bell for the lift, and as I had done so she had fumbled in her bag and gave me a note for a hundred francs. "Here," she had whispered, her tone intimate and unpleasant, "I want you to accept this small commission in return for bringing your patron to my shop." When I had refused, scarlet with embarrassment, she had shrugged her shoulders disagreeably. "Just as you like," she had said, "but I assure you it's quite usual. Perhaps you would rather have a frock. Come along to the shop some time without Madame and I will fix you up without charging you a sou." Somehow, I don't know why, I had been aware of that sick, unhealthy feeling I had experienced as a child when turning the pages of a forbidden book. The vision of the consumptive son faded, and in its stead arose the picture of myself had I been different, pocketing that greasy note with an understanding smile, and perhaps slipping round to Blaize's shop on this my free afternoon and coming away with a frock I had not paid for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道，”我说。“我一直没能亲眼看到。”接着，我又向他描述我如何按铃招呼电梯。而正当我按铃时，女裁缝在提包里摸索了一阵，掏出一张一百法郎的钞票，塞了过来。“（口努），”她用亲呢得讨厌的语调在我耳边说。“我请你收下这笔小小的佣金，请你带你的主人多多光顾本店。”我涨红了脸，窘态毕露，说什么也不肯收钱。女裁缝只好没趣地耸耸肩。“随你的便，”她说。“不过，我向你保证，这种事平常得很。也许你宁愿要件上衣吧。那就找个时间，避开夫人，独个儿到小店来一趟。我一定把你打扮得漂漂亮亮，不要你花一个子儿。”不知为什么，我突然领略到早年儿童时代偷看一部禁书时那种让人恶心的不健康的感觉。生肺病的儿子的形象消失了，代之而出现的是另一幅景象：如果我是另外一种类型的人，我就会报以心照不宜的一笑，把那张油污的钞票塞进口袋，要不就利用这个闲着没事的下午，偷偷到布莱兹的成衣铺去，出来时带着一件对方白送的上衣。">查看中文翻译</div>

Mine was a happy mood that afternoon, and I remember it well. I can see the rippled sky, fluffy with cloud, and the white whipped sea. I can feel again the wind on my face, and hear my laugh, and his that echoed it. It was not the Monte Carlo I had known, or perhaps the truth was that it pleased me better. There was a glamour about it that had not been before. I must have looked upon it before with dull eyes. The harbour was a dancing thing, with fluttering paper boats, and the sailors on the quay were jovial, smiling fellows, merry as the wind. We passed the yacht, beloved of Mrs Van Hopper because of its ducal owner, and snapped our fingers at the glistening brass, and looked at one another and laughed again. I can remember as though I wore it still my comfortable, ill-fitting flannel suit, and how the skirt was lighter than the coat through harder wear. My shabby hat, too broad about the brim, and my low-heeled shoes, fastened with a single strap. A pair of gauntlet gloves clutched in a grubby hand. I had never looked more youthful, I had never felt so old. Mrs Van Hopper and her influenza did not exist for me. The bridge and the cocktail parties were forgotten, and with them my own humble status.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind was too high for sketching, it tore in cheerful gusts around the corner of my cobbled square, and back to the car we went and drove I know not where. The long road climbed the hills, and the car climbed with it, and we circled in the heights like a bird in the air. How different his car to Mrs Van Hopper's hireling for the season, a square old-fashioned Daimler that took us to Mentone on placid afternoons, when I, sitting on the little seat with my back to the driver, must crane my neck to see the view.

He stopped the car, and I could see that the edge of the road bordered a vertical slope that crumbled into vacancy, a fall of perhaps two thousand feet. We got out of the car and looked beneath us. This sobered me at last. I knew that but half the car's length had lain between us and the fall. The sea, like a crinkled chart, spread to the horizon, and lapped the sharp outline of the coast, while the houses were white shells in a rounded grotto, pricked here and there by a great orange sun.

<div class="line_en">Down the twisting road we went without a check, without a word, a great ridge of cloud stretched above the setting sun, and the air was cold and clean. Suddenly he began to talk about Manderley. He said nothing of his life there, no word about himself, but he told me how the sun set there, on a spring afternoon, leaving a glow upon the headland. The sea would look like slate, cold still from the long winter, and from the terrace you could hear the ripple of the coming tide washing in the little bay. The daffodils were in bloom, stirring in the evening breeze, golden heads cupped upon lean stalks, and however many you might pick there would be no thinning of the ranks, they were massed like an army, shoulder to shoulder. On a bank below the lawns, crocuses were planted, golden, pink, and mauve, but by this time they would be past their best, dropping and fading, like pallid snowdrops. The primrose was more vulgar, a homely pleasant creature who appeared in every cranny like a weed. Too early yet for bluebells, their heads were still hidden beneath last year's leaves, but when they came, dwarfing the more humble violet, they choked the very bracken in the woods, and with their colour made a challenge to the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们沿着公路迂回下山，一路无话，也没有遇阻停车。一大堆峥嵘的乌云笼罩着落日，空气变得无比清冷。突然他提起了曼陀丽。他不说自己在庄园的生活；关于他本人，他一字不提。他只向我描绘曼陀丽春天黄昏的落日。夕阳在海岬留下火红的余辉，大海顿时变成一片墨绿，因为漫长的冬季刚过，海水仍然冰凉刺骨。置身于屋前的平台，你可以听到小海湾涨潮的涛声。这正是水仙怒放的季节，纤细的花茎托着金色的穗头，在晚风中微微摇曳。比肩密集的水仙犹如一支大军，不论你采摘多少，一点不会显出稀疏的缺口。草坪尽头的海岸上，种植着一大片藏红花，色彩有桔黄、淡红和紫红之别。不过，这时已不是藏红花的全盛季节，所以一朵朵都耷拉着脑袋，色衰花谢，犹如惨白的雪片。报春花比较粗俗低贱一些，就像野草一样，哪儿有缝隙就往哪儿生长，纵然姿色平平，倒也令人赏心悦目。风信子还没到开花时辰，花穗还掩面躲在去年的残叶丛中。但是一等到风信子怒放，不那么娇贵的紫罗兰顿时就相形见细，树林里的羊齿则被吞没得干干净净。风信子的娇艳完全可以同天空媲美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The primrose did not mind it quite so much; although a creature of the wilds it had a leaning towards civilization, and preened and smiled in a jam-jar in some cottage window without resentment, living quite a week if given water. No wild flowers came in the house at Manderley. He had special cultivated flowers, grown for the house alone, in the walled garden. A rose was one of the few flowers, he said, that looked better picked than growing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于本身的待遇，羊齿可并不十分在乎。这是一种野生植物，可偏偏喜欢与人类文明的雅趣沾点边。它们从农舍窗户后面的果酱罐里探出身来，搔头弄姿，丝毫不觉得有什么委屈，只要罐子里有水，足足可能活一个星期。在曼陀丽，野花不得进屋。他在由围墙圈起的花园里栽培几种仅供室内摆设用的鲜花。他告诉我，难得有几种花摘下之后反而更好看，玫瑰顿就是其中之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He never would have them in the house, he said. Thrust into vases they became dank and listless, and to see them at their best you must walk in the woods in the morning, about twelve o'clock, when the sun was overhead. They had a smoky, rather bitter smell, as though a wild sap ran in their stalks, pungent and juicy. People who plucked bluebells from the woods were vandals; he had forbidden it at Manderley. Sometimes, driving in the country, he had seen bicyclists with huge bunches strapped before them on the handles, the bloom already fading from the dying heads, the ravaged stalks straggling naked and unclean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说，他从来不许在室内陈设风信于。一插进花瓶，风信子就显得阴湿潦倒。要观赏妩媚绝伦的风信子，你得在正午十二点钟左右太阳当头时到林子里去信步漫游。这种花的香气刺鼻，并带点儿烟味，仿佛花荭里畅流着某种辛辣而饱满的野生液汁。那些在林子里采摘风信子的人简直就是破坏文物的野蛮人，为此，他曾在曼陀丽下过禁令。有时候，他开车穿过田野，看见一些家伙骑自行车经过，车把上捆着大束大束的风信子，因为穗头凋败，花朵已经褪色，被折的荭秆散乱地耷拉着赤裸的身子，成了一团糟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little pathway down the valley to the bay had clumps of azalea and rhododendron planted to the left of it, and if you wandered down it on a May evening after dinner it was just as though the shrubs had sweated in the air. You could stoop down and pick a fallen petal, crush it between your fingers, and you had there, in the hollow of your hand, the essence of a thousand scents, unbearable and sweet. All from a curled and crumpled petal. And you came out of the valley, heady and rather dazed, to the hard white shingle of the beach and the still water. A curious, perhaps too sudden contrast…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从山谷通向海湾的那条幽径，也是花团锦族，小径的左边种着大丛大丛的各色杜鹃。五月哪一天的黄昏，你如果沿着小径散步，就会发现灌木丛仿佛在风中淌汗。你弯身拾起一片落地的花瓣，用手指把它捻碎，顿时，从你的手掌心散发出干种奇香，沁人心脾。而这一切只不过是由一片被揉捏破碎的花瓣发出的。你悠然神往地走出山谷，来到海滩，脚下是坚硬的白色圆卵石和平静的海水。多么奇妙的对照！也许过于突兀…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A bowl of roses in a drawing-room had a depth of colour and scent they had not possessed in the open. There was something rather blousy about roses in full bloom, something shallow and raucous, like women with untidy hair. In the house they became mysterious and subtle. He had roses in the house at Manderley for eight months in the year. Did I like syringa, he asked me? There was a tree on the edge of the lawn he could smell from his bedroom window. His sister, who was a hard, rather practical person, used to complain that there were too many scents at Manderley, they made her drunk. Perhaps she was right. He did not care. It was the only form of intoxication that appealed to him. His earliest recollection was of great branches of lilac, standing in white jars, and they filled the house with a wistful, poignant smell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客厅里放一盆玫瑰，色彩鲜艳，浓香扑鼻，而自然界的玫瑰就没有这两大优点。怒放的玫瑰给人某种蓬头垢面的感觉，就像披头散发的女人，显得轻浮而粗俗。可一旦放进屋子，玫瑰时变得神秘深沉。一年之中有八个月，他让人在曼陀丽室内陈设玫瑰。我喜欢丁香吗？他问。草坪的尽头有一棵丁香树，站在他卧室的窗口就可闻到丁香的芬芳。他的姐姐是个冷漠而讲求实际的人，因此常常抱怨曼陀丽到处一片花香，使她沉醉。也许她是对的。那他也不管。唯有花香合他的胃口，使他陶醉。回忆早年，他总想起插在白色花瓶里的大束紫丁香以及弥漫在屋子四处发人遐思的扑鼻异香。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he spoke the car became one of many once again, dusk had fallen without my noticing it, and we were in the midst of light and sound in the streets of Monte Carlo. The clatter jagged on my nerves, and the lights were far too brilliant, far too yellow. It was a swift, unwelcome anticlimax.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon we would come to the hotel, and I felt for my gloves in the pocket of the car. I found them, and my fingers closed upon a book as well, whose slim covers told of poetry. I peered to read the title as the car slowed down before the door of the hotel. "You can take it and read it if you like," he said, his voice casual and indifferent now that the drive was over, and we were back again, and Manderley was many hundreds of miles distant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们马上就要回到旅馆。我在车厢的抽屉里摸索着找我的手套。找到手套的同时，我的手指碰上一本书，精致纤巧的封面说明这是一部诗集。车子在旅馆门前放慢速度的当儿，我正眯缝着眼睛想看清书名。“要是你愿意，拿去读吧，”他说。驾车出游已告结束，我们回到了旅馆，曼陀丽已被抛在几百英里之外，他的语调于是又变得随随便便，漫不经心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went up the hotel steps alone, with all the despondency of a child whose treat is over. My afternoon had spoilt me for the hours that still remained, and I thought how long they would seem until my bed-time, how empty too my supper all alone. Somehow I could not face the bright inquiries of the nurse upstairs, or the possibilities of Mrs Van Hopper's husky interrogation, so I sat down in the corner of the lounge behind a pillar and ordered tea.</div>

I wished he were less remote; and I anything but the creature that I was in my shabby coat and skirt, my broad-brimmed schoolgirl hat.</div>

<div class="line_en">I shut the book with a snap, and put it away under my gloves; and stretching to a nearby chair, I took up an old copy of VIllustration and turned the pages. There were some fine photographs of the chateaux of the Loire, and an article as well. I read it carefully, referring to the photographs, but when I finished I knew I had not understood a word. It was not Blois with its thin turrets and its spires that stared up at me from the printed page. It was the face of Mrs Van Hopper in the restaurant the day before, her small pig's eyes darting to the neighbouring table, her fork, heaped high with ravioli, pausing in mid-air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我啪的一声合上诗集，把书塞到手套底下，伸手从近处的一张椅子里拿起一本过期的《插图》杂志，信手翻着。杂志里有几幅挺不错的洛埃河上古城堡的照片，并附有说明文字。我专心阅读这篇文章，不时参看照片。但是待我把这篇文章读完，却意识到自己一个字也没读进去．从印刷物中赫然盯着我的不是布卢瓦地方细长的城堡角楼和锥形尖塔，而是前一天范—霍珀夫人在餐厅里的那副尊容：猪一样的小眼睛向着邻桌扫去，五香碎肉卷串满了餐叉，停在半空不往哈里送。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I picked up the book again, and this time it opened at the title-page, and I read the dedication. "Max -- from Rebecca. 17 May", written in a curious slanting hand. A little blob of ink marred the white page opposite, as though the writer, in impatience, had shaken her pen to make the ink flow freely. And then as it bubbled through the nib, it came a little thick, so that the name Rebecca stood out black and strong, the tall and sloping R dwarfing the other letters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又拿起诗集。这一回，书掀在扉页上，我看到上面写着留念题字：“给迈克斯——吕蓓卡赠，五月十七日”。字是用一手相当不凡的斜体写成的。有一小滴墨水沾在对面的空白页上，似乎写字的人因为性急，曾见了甩笔，想使墨水流得更顺畅一些。而当墨水冒着小泡从笔尖淌出时，稍稍有些过量，所以吕蓓卡那浓墨的名字显得很突出，笔力遭劲；那个往一边倾斜的字母R特别高大，对照之下，其他字母显得矮小。">查看中文翻译</div>
