<div class="line_en">The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king's justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran's life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晨色清冷，带着一丝寂寥，隐然暗示夏日将尽。为数二十人的队伍于破晓时分启程，布兰策马置身其间，满心焦虑又兴奋难耐。这次他年纪总算够大，可与父兄同往刑场，一观国王律法的执行。这是夏天的第九年，布兰七岁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而眼前这个老人削瘦枯槁，比罗柏高不了多少，手脚紧缚身后，静待国王的旨意发落。他在酷寒中因冻疮失去了双耳和一根手指。而他全身漆黑的衣服，与守夜人弟兄们的制服没有两样，只不过衣衫褴褛，脓疮四溢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. "Ice," that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man's hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨的寒意里，布兰听到有人问了些问题，以及问题的答案，然而事后他却想不起来究竟说过了哪些话。总之最后父亲下了命令，两名卫士便把那衣衫褴褛的人拖到空地中央的铁树木桩前，将头硬是按在漆黑的硬木上。艾德·史塔克解鞍下马，他的养子席恩·葛雷乔伊立刻递上宝剑。剑名“寒冰”，身宽过掌，立起来比罗柏还高。剑刃乃是用瓦雷利亚钢锻造而成，受过法术加持，颜色暗如黑烟。世上没有别的东西比瓦雷利亚钢更锐利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he'd seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人马的气息在清晨的冷空气里交织成蒸腾的雪白雾网，父亲下令将墙边的人犯松绑，拖到队伍前面。罗柏和琼恩直挺背脊，昂然跨坐鞍背；布兰则骑着小马停在两人中间，努力想表现出七岁孩童所没有的成熟气度，仿佛眼前一切早已司空见惯。微风吹过栅门，众人头顶飘扬着临冬城史塔克家族的旗帜，上面画着白底灰色的冰原奔狼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bran's father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father's face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲神情肃穆地骑在马上，满头棕色长发在风中飞扬。他修剪整齐的胡子里冒出几缕白丝，看起来比三十五岁的实际年龄要老些。这天他的灰色眼瞳严厉无情，怎么看也不像是那个会在风雪夜里端坐炉前，娓娓细述远古英雄纪元和森林之子故事的人。他已经摘下慈父的容颜，戴上临冬城主史塔克公爵的面具，布兰心想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The deserter died bravely," Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother's coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. "He had courage, at the least."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这逃兵死得挺勇敢。”罗柏说。高大壮硕的他每天都在成长，他承袭了母亲的白皙肤色、红褐头发，以及徒利家族的蓝色眼眸。“不管怎么说，好歹他有点勇气。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ass," Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran's shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. "You did well," Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“混账东西。”琼恩低声咒道，刻意放低声音不让葛雷乔伊听见。他伸手搭住布兰肩膀，布兰也转头看着私生子哥哥。“你做得很好。”琼恩神情庄重地告诉他。琼恩今年十四岁，观看死刑对他来说已是司空见惯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Jon Snow said quietly. "It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark." Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不对，”琼恩静静地说，“那不算勇气。史塔克，这家伙正是因为恐惧而死的，你可以从他的眼神里看出来。”琼恩的灰色眼瞳深得近乎墨黑，但世间少有事物能逃过他的观察。他与罗柏同年，两人容貌却大相径庭：罗柏肌肉发达，皮肤白皙，强壮而动作迅速；琼恩则是体格精瘦，肤色沉黑，举止优雅而敏捷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran had no answer for that. "King Robert has a headsman," he said, uncertainly.</div>

<div class="line_en">His lord father smiled. "Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲微笑道：“老奶妈又跟你说故事了。那人其实是个逃兵，背弃了守夜人的誓言。世间最危险的人莫过于此，因为他们自知一旦被捕，只有死路一条，于是恶向胆边生，再伤天害理的勾当也干得出来。不过你会错了意，我不是问你他为什么要死，而是我为何要亲自行刑”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was a wildling," Bran said. "They carry off women and sell them to the Others."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为他是野人，”布兰不假思索地回答，“他们绑架女人，然后把她们卖给异鬼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He does," his father admitted. "As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他确实是由王家刽子手代劳，执行国王律法，”父亲承认，“在他之前的坦格利安王朝也是如此。但我们遵循古老的传统，史塔克家族的人体内仍流有‘先民’的血液，而我们相信判决死刑的人必须亲自动手。如果你要取人性命，至少应该注视他的双眼，聆听他的临终遗言。倘若做不到这点，那么或许他罪不致死。”">查看中文翻译</div>
