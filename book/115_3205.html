<div class="line_en">When I awoke the next morning, just after six o'clock, and got up and went to the window there was a foggy dew upon the grass like frost, and the trees were shrouded in a white mist. There was a chill in the air and a little, fresh wind, and the cold, quiet smell of autumn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天清晨，六点刚过，我就醒了。我从床上爬起，走到窗前。草坪上结了一层霜一般的银色露珠，树丛隐没在白茫茫的迷雾里。清新的微风夹着几分寒气，使人感到了安谧、萧瑟的秋意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I knelt by the window looking down on to the rose-garden where the flowers themselves drooped upon their stalks, the petals brown and dragging after last night's rain, the happenings of the day before seemed remote and unreal. Here at Manderley a new day was starting, the things of the garden were not concerned with our troubles. A blackbird ran across the rose-garden to the lawns in swift, short rushes, stopping now and again to stab at the earth with his yellow beak. A thrush, too, went about his business, and two stout little wagtails, following one another, and a little cluster of twittering sparrows. A gull poised himself high in the air, silent and alone, and then spread his wings wide and swooped beyond the lawns to the woods and the Happy Valley. These things continued, our worries and anxieties had no power to alter them. Soon the gardeners would be astir, brushing the first leaves from the lawns and the paths, raking the gravel in the drive. Pails would clank in the courtyard behind the house, the hose would be turned on the car, the little scullery maid would begin to chatter through the open door to the men in the yard. There would be the crisp, hot smell of bacon. The housemaids would open up the house, throw wide the windows, draw back the curtains.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maids sweeping in the morning-room, the drawing-room, the fresh clean air pouring into the long open windows. Smoke curling from the chimneys, and little by little the autumn mist fading away and the trees and the banks and the woods taking shape, the glimmer of the sea showing with the sun upon it below the valley, the beacon standing tall and straight upon the headland.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dogs would crawl from their baskets, yawn and stretch themselves, wander out on to the terrace and blink at the first struggles of the pale sun coming through the mist. Robert would lay the table for breakfast, bring in those piping scones, the clutch of eggs, the glass dishes of honey, jam, and marmalade, the bowl of peaches, the cluster of purple grapes with the bloom upon them still, hot from the greenhouses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狗儿将从各自的篓子里爬出来，打个阿欠，舒展舒展身子，然后走到平台上，朝正从迷雾中挣扎露头的苍白的太阳眨巴着眼睛。罗伯特将铺开餐桌，端上早点：花色软饼一窝鸡蛋、几碟蜂蜜和果酱、一盆桃子，另外还有一串刚从暖房摘下的新鲜紫葡萄，上面还留着一层粉衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The peace of Manderley. The quietude and the grace. Whoever lived within its walls, whatever trouble there was and strife, however much uneasiness and pain, no matter what tears were shed, what sorrows borne, the peace of Manderley could not be broken or the loveliness destroyed. The flowers that died would bloom again another year, the same birds build their nests, the same trees blossom. The old quiet moss smell would linger in the air, and bees would come, and crickets, and herons build their nests in the deep dark woods. The butterflies would dance their merry jig across the lawns, and spiders spin foggy webs, and small startled rabbits who had no business to come trespassing poke their faces through the crowded shrubs. There would be lilac, and honeysuckle still, and the white magnolia buds unfolding slow and tight beneath the dining-room window. No one would ever hurt Manderley. It would lie always in a hollow like an enchanted thing, guarded by the woods, safe, secure, while the sea broke and ran and came again in the little shingle bays below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安宁、幽静、优美的曼陀丽！不管围墙之内住的是谁，不管出现什么样的纷争和冲突，不管忧虑和痛苦如何揪心，不管人们为何热泪滚滚，也不论人们承受的是何种悲辛，曼陀丽的安宁不会蒙受任何惊忧，曼陀丽的秀色也不会遭到些微毁损。繁花凋谢了，来年又会竟相争妍；飞来筑巢的还同样是那些鸟儿，花开吐芳的还同样是那些草木。陈年苔藓的那种幽香又会在空中久留不散；蜜蜂，还有蟋蟀，都会来重游这片故土；苍鹭也将在密林深处建窝筑巢。蝴蝶又要在草地上欢乐起舞，蜘蛛又要结织雾状的丝网；而那些无端闯入的受惊的小兔就在密集的灌木丛里探头探脑。百合花，还有金银花，都会在园中盛开；白木兰的花蕾则在餐厅窗下徐徐绽开。谁也不能伤害曼陀丽一根毫毛。宅子将永远像座魔宫似地屹立在这片低四地上，四周由密林护卫，安然无姜，任凭海水在树林下方的圆卵石小海湾里冲刷，奔腾，拍打。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim slept on and I did not wake him. The day ahead of us would be a weary thing and long. High roads, and telegraph poles, and the monotony of passing traffic, the slow crawl into London. We did not know what we should find at the end of our journey. The future was unknown. Somewhere to the north of London lived a man called Baker who had never heard of us, but he held our future in the hollow of his hand. Soon he too would be waking, stretching, yawning, going about the business of his day. I got up, and went into the bathroom, and began to run my bath. These actions held for me the same significance as Robert and his clearing of the library had the night before. I had done these things before mechanically, but now I was aware as I dropped my sponge into the water, as I spread my towel on the chair from the hot rail, as I lay back and let the water run over my body. Every moment was a precious thing, having in it the essence of finality. When I went back to the bedroom and began to dress I heard a soft footstep come and pause outside the door, and the key turn quietly in the lock. There was silence a moment, and then the footsteps went away. It was Mrs Danvers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆还熟睡着，我也不去唤醒他。我们面临的将是令人困顿的漫漫一天：公路，电线杆，单调的来往车辆，进伦敦时的缓缓爬行。我们不知道此行最终会得到什么样的结果。前途吉凶未卜。在伦敦北面某处住着一个叫贝克的人，他与我们素昧平生，却在手心里在掌握着我们的命运。过一会儿。此人也会苏醒过来，伸伸懒腰，打个阿欠，然后开始他一天的工作。我站起身子，走入浴室，开始在浴盆中放洗澡水。我这时的一系列动作，就其所包含的意义来说，也和罗伯特昨晚收拾藏书室没有什么两样。以前我做这些事情的时候，纯粹是无意识的机械动作，可现在，当我把海绵丢入水中，当我从暖烘烘的架子上取下毛巾，摊在椅子上，当我在浴盆内躺下，任水流遍我全身，这每一个动作我全都清楚地意识到了。一分一秒的时间都极其珍贵，包含着某种最后归宿的精髓。当我回到卧室开始穿衣的时候，我听到一阵悄悄的脚步声，由远及近，最后在门外停下。接着，钥匙在锁孔里轻轻转动了一下。片刻寂静之后，又响起逐渐远去的脚步声。那是丹弗斯太太。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I finished dressing, and went and turned on Maxim's bath. Presently Clarice came with our tea. I woke Maxim. He stared at me at first like a puzzled child, and then he held out his arms. We drank our tea. He got up and went to his bath and I began putting things methodically in my suitcase. It might be that we should have to stay in London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我穿好衣服，走去替迈克西姆放洗澡水。不大一会，克拉丽斯给我们送来早茶，我叫醒迈克西姆。起初，他像小孩那样莫名其妙地睁大眼睛看着我发楞，随后他伸开了双臂。我们一起喝了早茶。他起床洗澡去了，我开始有条不紊地收拾行装，把旅行用品放进手提箱内。说不定我们得在伦敦盘桓小住呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had not forgotten. I had heard the same sound the night before after we had come up from the library. She had not knocked upon the door, she had not made herself known; there was just the sound of footsteps and the turning of the key in the lock. It brought me to reality and the facing of the immediate future.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有忘记。昨晚，我们从藏书室上楼回到房间之后，我也听到过同样的声音。她没有敲门，不想让人知道她过来这儿；只有悄悄的脚步声以及钥匙在锁孔里转动的声音。这声音又把我带回到实际生活中来，让我正视即将面临的现实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I packed the brushes Maxim had given me, a nightdress, my dressing-gown and slippers, and another dress too and a pair of shoes. My dressing-case looked unfamiliar as I dragged it from the back of a wardrobe. It seemed so long since I had used it, and yet it was only four months ago. It still had the Customs mark upon it they had chalked at Calais. In one of the pockets was a concert ticket from the casino in Monte Carlo. I crumpled it and threw it into the waste-paper basket. It might have belonged to another age, another world. My bedroom began to take on the appearance of all rooms when the owner goes away. The dressing-table was bare without my brushes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把迈克西姆送我的发刷、一件睡衣、我日常穿的晨衣和拖鞋一样一样放进手提箱，还塞进一件替换衣眼和一双鞋子。当我把手提箱从衣柜深处拖出来时，我觉得它挺眼生。我似乎已经好久好久没用过它了，其实也不过隔了四个月的时间。箱子面上还留着加来海关关员涂写的粉笔记号。一只箱子袋里夹有一张蒙特卡洛乐场的音乐会票子。我把它捏成一团，丢进废纸篓。它该属于另一个时代，另一个天地。卧室开始呈现出主人离家时常有的那种狼藉景象。发刷装进提箱以后，梳妆台上就空无一物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I turned and went downstairs to breakfast. It was cold in the dining-room, the sun not yet on the windows, and I was grateful for the scalding bitter coffee and heartening bacon. Maxim and I ate in silence. Now and again he glanced at the clock. I heard Robert put the suitcases in the hall with the rug, and presently there was the sound of the car being brought to the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转身下楼去吃早餐。餐厅里冷飕飕的，太阳还没有照上窗台。我很感激他们给我端来滚烫的清咖啡和使人精神振作的熏肉。迈克西姆和我默默地吃着。他不时望望钟。我听见罗伯特把我们的手提箱和旅行毛毯放在大厅里，不多久就响起汽车开到门口的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was tissue-paper lying on the floor, and an old label. The beds where we had slept had a terrible emptiness about them. The towels lay crumpled on the bathroom floor. The wardrobe doors gaped open. I put on my hat so that I should not have to come up again, and I took my bag and my gloves and my suitcase. I glanced round the room to see if there was anything I had forgotten. The mist was breaking, the sun was forcing its way through and throwing patterns on the carpet. When I was halfway down the passage I had a curious, inexplicable feeling that I must go back and look in my room again. I went without reason, and stood a moment looking at the gaping wardrobe and the empty bed, and the tray of tea upon the table. I stared at them, impressing them for ever on my mind, wondering why they had the power to touch me, to sadden me, as though they were children that did not want me to go away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="包东西用的薄纸，撒了一地，此外还有张旧标签。我们睡过的那张床空荡荡的，给人一种凄凉感。浴巾丢在浴室的地板上，皱成了一团。衣柜门敞开着。我把帽子戴上，这样待会儿就不必再上楼来；我拿起提包和手套，拎起箱子，向房间四下扫了一眼，看看还有什么忘记带了。阳光透过渐渐消散的迷雾，在地毯上投下一幅幅图案。我沿过道走去，但走到一半，不知怎地心头突然生出一种无可名状的奇怪感觉，觉得非回去再把房间好好看上一眼不可。于是我就这么莫名其妙地走回去，又在房间里停留了片刻，看一眼洞开着的衣柜，看一眼空荡荡的卧床，看一眼桌上的那盘茶具。我盯着这些东西看，让它们永远缕刻在自己的脑海里，一面暗暗奇怪，为什么这些东西竟有着这么一股扣动我心弦，使我黯然伤感的力量，就好像它们是一群舍不得我离去的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went out and stood on the terrace. The rain had cleared the air, and the grass smelt fresh and sweet. When the sun was higher it would be a lovely day. I thought how we might have wandered in the valley before lunch, and then sat out afterwards under the chestnut tree with books and papers. I closed my eyes a minute and felt the warmth of the sun on my face and on my hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走出餐厅，站在平台上。雨后的空气分外清新，青草散发出沁人肺腑的清香。但等红日高照，一定是个秋高气爽的日子。我想，要不是出门，说不定我们在午餐前会去幸福谷散步，饭后就坐在外面那棵栗子树下看书读报。我闭上眼睛，静静的站了一会儿，阳光照在我脸上和手上，使我感到一阵暖意。">查看中文翻译</div>

Favell was sitting at the wheel, hatless, a cigarette in his mouth. He grinned when he saw us, and waved us on. I settled down in my seat for the journey ahead, one hand on Maxim's knee. The hours passed, and the miles were covered. I watched the road ahead in a kind of stupor. Colonel Julyan slept at the back from time to time. I turned occasionally and saw his head loll against the cushions, and his mouth open. The green car kept close beside us. Sometimes it shot ahead, sometimes it dropped behind. But we never lost it. At one we stopped for lunch at one of those inevitable old-fashioned hotels in the main street of a county town.</div>

"Of course I understand, and I'll do anything in my power to help you. If you will excuse me a few minutes I will go and look up my files. There should be a record of every appointment booked throughout the year, and a description of the case. Please help yourself to cigarettes. It's too early to offer you sherry, I suppose?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim did not say anything. I could hear the sound of the tennis balls from the court. The Scotch terrier was barking. A woman's voice shouted to him to be quiet. The summer holidays. Baker playing with his boys. We had interrupted their routine. A high-pitched, gold clock in a glass case ticked very fast on the mantelpiece. There was a postcard of the Lake of Geneva leaning against it. The Bakers had friends in Switzerland.</div>
