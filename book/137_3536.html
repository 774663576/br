<div class="line_en">The priest whom the young girls had observed at the top of the North tower, leaning over the Place and so attentive to the dance of the gypsy, was, in fact, Archdeacon Claude Frollo.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every day, an hour before sunset, the archdeacon ascended the staircase to the tower, and shut himself up in this cell, where he sometimes passed whole nights. That day, at the moment when, standing before the low door of his retreat, he was fitting into the lock the complicated little key which he always carried about him in the purse suspended to his side, a sound of tambourine and castanets had reached his ear. These sounds came from the Place du Parvis. The cell, as we have already said, had only one window opening upon the rear of the church. Claude Frollo had hastily withdrawn the key, and an instant later, he was on the top of the tower, in the gloomy and pensive attitude in which the maidens had seen him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our readers have not forgotten the mysterious cell which the archdeacon had reserved for himself in that tower. (I do not know, by the way be it said, whether it be not the same, the interior of which can be seen to-day through a little square window, opening to the east at the height of a man above the platform from which the towers spring; a bare and dilapidated den, whose badly plastered walls are ornamented here and there, at the present day, with some wretched yellow engravings representing the façades of cathedrals. I presume that this hole is jointly inhabited by bats and spiders, and that, consequently, it wages a double war of extermination on the flies).</div>

<div class="line_en">There he stood, grave, motionless, absorbed in one look and one thought. All Paris lay at his feet, with the thousand spires of its edifices and its circular horizon of gentle hills -- with its river winding under its bridges, and its people moving to and fro through its streets,-- with the clouds of its smoke,-- with the mountainous chain of its roofs which presses Notre-Dame in its doubled folds; but out of all the city, the archdeacon gazed at one corner only of the pavement, the Place du Parvis; in all that throng at but one figure,-- the gypsy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伏在那里，庄重，呆滞，沉湎于那唯一的凝视、唯一的思虑之中。巴黎全城都在他的脚下：它那无数的建筑物尖塔，它那山丘环抱的淡淡的天边，塞纳河在桥下扭曲，民众在街上波动，烟雾迷漫，屋顶如鳞，一层层构成无尽的串链，以其密集的环扣紧紧压挤着圣母院。然而，于全城中，副主教只盯着一角地面，那就是圣母院前的广场；于人群中，只看见一个身影，那就是吉卜赛姑娘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It would have been difficult to say what was the nature of this look, and whence proceeded the flame that flashed from it. It was a fixed gaze, which was, nevertheless, full of trouble and tumult. And, from the profound immobility of his whole body, barely agitated at intervals by an involuntary shiver, as a tree is moved by the wind; from the stiffness of his elbows, more marble than the balustrade on which they leaned; or the sight of the petrified smile which contracted his face,-- one would have said that nothing living was left about Claude Frollo except his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要说清楚他的目光是什么性质，其中火光熠熠又是怎么回事，那是很不容易的。这是凝滞的目光，然而迷惘、狂乱。他全身僵立，是那样深沉，只有间或机械似的战栗使他微微惊动，就像风中的大树；他双肘撑着栏杆，比栏杆更像石头；微笑僵死在嘴角上，整个脸也抽搐起来，——看见这一切，真可以说，克洛德·弗罗洛整个的人只剩下两只眼睛还活着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crowd was swarming around her; from time to time, a man accoutred in red and yellow made them form into a circle, and then returned, seated himself on a chair a few paces from the dancer, and took the goat's head on his knees. This man seemed to be the gypsy's companion. Claude Frollo could not distinguish his features from his elevated post.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="观众群集在她周围。不时，有个男人身穿一半黄、一半红的宽袖短衫上来打圆场，然后回到距离跳舞姑娘几步的一张椅子坐下，搂住山羊，两膝夹着它的脑袋。这个男人好像是吉卜赛姑娘的伴侣。克洛德·弗罗洛从他所站的高处向下望去，看不清楚他的面容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the moment when the archdeacon caught sight of this stranger, his attention seemed divided between him and the dancer, and his face became more and more gloomy. All at once he rose upright, and a quiver ran through his whole body: "Who is that man?" he muttered between his teeth: "I have always seen her alone before!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="副主教看见这个陌生人之后，注意力好像在跳舞姑娘和这个男人之间分散了，脸色越来越阴沉。突然，他站直身子，全身战栗，悻悻然自言自语：“这个人是谁？我一向看见她是一个人的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he plunged down beneath the tortuous vault of the spiral staircase, and once more descended. As he passed the door of the bell chamber, which was ajar, he saw something which struck him; he beheld Quasimodo, who, leaning through an opening of one of those slate penthouses which resemble enormous blinds, appeared also to be gazing at the Place. He was engaged in so profound a contemplation, that he did not notice the passage of his adopted father. His savage eye had a singular expression; it was a charmed, tender look. "This is strange!" murmured Claude. "Is it the gypsy at whom he is thus gazing?" He continued his descent. At the end of a few minutes, the anxious archdeacon entered upon the Place from the door at the base of the tower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他冲到螺旋楼梯的盘旋拱顶之下，急速跑下楼去。经过微微开启的钟笼小门的时候，他瞥见一件事情，不觉一惊：卡席莫多伏在很像巨型窗板的石板遮檐的开口那里，也在向广场眺望。他沉浸在深沉的静观之中，没有发现养父经过。他那狂乱的眼睛中有一种异样的表情。这是一种被迷惑的含情脉脉的目光。——“真奇怪！”克洛德心想，“难道他也在看那个埃及姑娘吗？”他继续往下走。几分钟之后，满腹心事的副主教从钟楼底部的侧门走到了广场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gypsy was dancing; she was twirling her tambourine on the tip of her finger, and tossing it into the air as she danced Provençal sarabands; agile, light, joyous, and unconscious of the formidable gaze which descended perpendicularly upon her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉卜赛姑娘舞着。手鼓在她指尖上旋转。她一边跳着普罗旺斯的萨腊邦达舞（19），一边把手鼓扔起在空中。矫捷、轻盈、欢乐，她全然不觉得那可怕目光狠狠落在她头上的重量。【注：（19）一种三拍子的西班牙舞。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The harsh voice of the archdeacon threw the poor fellow into such a commotion that he lost his equilibrium, together with his whole edifice, and the chair and the cat tumbled pell-mell upon the heads of the spectators, in the midst of inextinguishable hootings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这严厉的叫喊使这可怜的家伙大吃一惊，激动万分，那整个的建筑物就失去了平衡，椅子和猫一古脑儿砸在观众的头上，激起了一片叫骂，经久不息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the place of the gypsy, on the carpet, whose arabesques had seemed to vanish but a moment previously by the capricious figures of her dance, the archdeacon no longer beheld any one but the red and yellow man, who, in order to earn a few testers in his turn, was walking round the circle, with his elbows on his hips, his head thrown back, his face red, his neck outstretched, with a chair between his teeth. To the chair he had fastened a cat, which a neighbor had lent, and which was spitting in great affright.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚才吉卜赛姑娘舞影婆娑，遮没了地毯上的蔓藤花纹。现在就在这块地毯上，不见埃及姑娘，只见那个穿半红半黄衣衫的男人，为了也来挣几个小钱，在走圆场，他双手反剪，头向后仰，脸涨得通红，绷着脖子，用牙齿叼着一把椅子，椅子上拴着街坊上一个女人借给他的一只猫。猫吓得直叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Notre-Dame!" exclaimed the archdeacon, at the moment when the juggler, perspiring heavily, passed in front of him with his pyramid of chair and his cat, "What is Master Pierre Gringoire doing here?"</div>

<div class="line_en">When they had advanced a few paces, Dom Claude placed his back against a pillar, and gazed intently at Gringoire. The gaze was not the one which Gringoire feared, ashamed as he was of having been caught by a grave and learned person in the costume of a buffoon. There was nothing mocking or ironical in the priest's glance, it was serious, tranquil, piercing. The archdeacon was the first to break the silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cathedral was already dark and deserted; the side-aisles were full of shadows, and the lamps of the chapels began to shine out like stars, so black had the vaulted ceiling become.

<div class="line_en">"Messire," said Gringoire, piteously, "it is, in fact, an amazing accoutrement. You see me no more comfortable in it than a cat coiffed with a calabash. 'Tis very ill done, I am conscious, to expose messieurs the sergeants of the watch to the liability of cudgelling beneath this cassock the humerus of a Pythagorean philosopher. But what would you have, my reverend master? 'tis the fault of my ancient jerkin, which abandoned me in cowardly wise, at the beginning of the winter, under the pretext that it was falling into tatters, and that it required repose in the basket of a rag-picker. What is one to do? Civilization has not yet arrived at the point where one can go stark naked, as ancient Diogenes wished. Add that a very cold wind was blowing, and 'tis not in the month of January that one can successfully attempt to make humanity take this new step. This garment presented itself, I took it, and I left my ancient black smock, which, for a hermetic like myself, was far from being hermetically closed. Behold me then, in the garments of a stage-player, like Saint Genest. What would you have? 'tis an eclipse. Apollo himself tended the flocks of Admetus."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰古瓦一副可怜相，说道：“先生，服装确实很古怪，您看见我这么个打扮，可羞得很，赛过一只猫顶着葫芦瓢。我自己也觉得这个样子很不好，简直就是存心让自己去给巡防什长先生们棒打这件衣衫里面的毕塔哥拉斯哲学家的肩胛骨！可是，您叫我怎么办呢，我尊敬的老师？全怪我的短外套，冬天一开始，它就卑鄙地抛弃了我，借口说它只剩短布条儿了，需要到收破烂儿的大筐里休息去了。怎么办呢？文明还没有发达到可以像狄奥吉纳斯所主张的裸体行走（22）的地步。况且，冷风直吹，试试叫人类迈出这样新的一步，获得成功，总不能在一月份吧？凑巧有这么一件短衫，我就拿了，把我那件又旧又破的黑罩衫扔掉了，对于我这么个严密的哲学家来说，太破太不严密了（23）。所以，现在我就跟圣惹内斯特一样穿小丑服装（24）了。您说叫我怎么办？是一种堕落！可是阿波罗在阿德迈特斯家里还看过猪哩（25）！”【注：（22）狄奥吉纳斯为古希腊著名犬儒学派哲学家（前413—前323），主张之一为人必须去尽各种欲望，包括穿衣服的需要。（23）前后的“严密”是一语双关，属于文字游戏。（24）圣惹内斯特是古罗马时代为传播基督教而殉道的人，临刑前被迫穿上小丑服装。（25）阿德迈特斯是费勒斯王，曾款待变为凡人模样的阿波罗，阿波罗为报答他，允许他长生不死。给阿德迈特斯看猪，可能是彼埃尔想当然耳。】">查看中文翻译</div>

So, when you addressed me, I was as foolish as an ass before a turnspit. But what would you have, messire? One must eat every day, and the finest Alexandrine verses are not worth a bit of Brie cheese. Now, I made for Madame Marguerite of Flanders, that famous epithalamium, as you know, and the city will not pay me, under the pretext that it was not excellent; as though one could give a tragedy of Sophocles for four crowns! Hence, I was on the point of dying with hunger. Happily, I found that I was rather strong in the jaw; so I said to this jaw,-- perform some feats of strength and of equilibrium: nourish thyself. Ale te ipsam. A pack of beggars who have become my good friends, have taught me twenty sorts of herculean feats, and now I give to my teeth every evening the bread which they have earned during the day by the sweat of my brow. After all, concede, I grant that it is a sad employment for my intellectual faculties, and that man is not made to pass his life in beating the tambourine and biting chairs.

<div class="line_en">"'Tis very difficult to explain," replied the poet. "It is a superstition. My wife is, according to what an old thief, who is called among us the Duke of Egypt, has told me, a foundling or a lost child, which is the same thing. She wears on her neck an amulet which, it is affirmed, will cause her to meet her parents some day, but which will lose its virtue if the young girl loses hers. Hence it follows that both of us remain very virtuous."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诗人说道：“一言难尽呀！总之是迷信：听他们称作埃及公爵的一个老偷儿告诉我，我的妻子是个弃儿，或者说，是丢失的孩子，反正一档子事儿。她脖子上挂着一个护身符，据说是会使她日后与父母重逢。但是，要是这姑娘失去童贞，护身符就失去灵性。因此，我和她两个人都守身如玉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What would you have a man do, Dom Claude, as against a superstition? She has got that in her head. I assuredly esteem as a rarity this nunlike prudery which is preserved untamed amid those Bohemian girls who are so easily brought into subjection. But she has three things to protect her: the Duke of Egypt, who has taken her under his safeguard, reckoning, perchance, on selling her to some gay abbé; all his tribe, who hold her in singular veneration, like a Notre-Dame; and a certain tiny poignard, which the buxom dame always wears about her, in some nook, in spite of the ordinances of the provost, and which one causes to fly out into her hands by squeezing her waist. 'Tis a proud wasp, I can tell you!"</div>

<div class="line_en">La Esmeralda, in the judgment of Gringoire, was an inoffensive and charming creature, pretty, with the exception of a pout which was peculiar to her; a naïve and passionate damsel, ignorant of everything and enthusiastic about everything; not yet aware of the difference between a man and a woman, even in her dreams; made like that; wild especially over dancing, noise, the open air; a sort of woman bee, with invisible wings on her feet, and living in a whirlwind. She owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led. Gringoire had succeeded in learning that, while a mere child, she had traversed Spain and Catalonia, even to Sicily; he believed that she had even been taken by the caravan of Zingari, of which she formed a part, to the kingdom of Algiers, a country situated in Achaia, which country adjoins, on one side Albania and Greece; on the other, the Sicilian Sea, which is the road to Constantinople. The Bohemians, said Gringoire, were vassals of the King of Algiers, in his quality of chief of the White Moors. One thing is certain, that la Esmeralda had come to France while still very young, by way of Hungary. From all these countries the young girl had brought back fragments of queer jargons, songs, and strange ideas, which made her language as motley as her costume, half Parisian, half African. However, the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety, her daintiness, her lively manners, her dances, and her songs. She believed herself to be hated, in all the city, by but two persons, of whom she often spoke in terror: the sacked nun of the Tour-Roland, a villanous recluse who cherished some secret grudge against these gypsies, and who cursed the poor dancer every time that the latter passed before her window; and a priest, who never met her without casting at her looks and words which frightened her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按照格兰古瓦的看法，爱斯美腊达这姑娘又驯良、又迷人；美貌，只除了她特有的那么一撇嘴；天真烂漫，极为热情，什么也不懂，对什么都很热心；甚至还不懂男女有什么区别，即使在梦中也不知道；天生就是这样的嘛！特别喜欢跳舞、热闹、野外生活；是一种蜜蜂似的女人，脚上有看不见的翅膀，生活在不断飞旋之中。格兰古瓦得知，很小的时候她曾经走遍西班牙和卡泰罗尼亚，甚至到过西西里；他甚至相信，她那个茨冈人车队曾经把她带到阿尔及尔王国去过，这个王国在阿卡雅境内，而阿卡雅则一边与小小的阿尔巴尼亚和希腊毗邻，另一边濒临西西里海，是去君士坦丁堡的必经之路（31）。格兰古瓦说，这些流浪者是阿尔及尔国王（他是白摩尔人民族的首领）的臣民。肯定无疑，爱斯美腊达是很小的时候经由匈牙利到法国来的。这姑娘从这些国家零零碎碎带来了那里的古怪方言、歌曲和奇特思想，使得她说的话相当古怪，就像她那一半巴黎式、一半非洲式的服装一样古怪。不过，她常去的那些街道的居民倒很喜欢她，喜欢她的快活天性、善良脾性、天真活泼，也喜欢她唱的歌、跳的舞。她自己认为全城只有两个人恨她，她谈起来就心惊胆战：一个是罗朗塔楼的麻袋女，这个可恶的隐修女不知怎么的，对埃及女人怀恨在心，可怜的跳舞姑娘只要经过她的窗洞，就要挨骂；另一个是一个教士，只要碰见她，总是向她投射恶毒的眼光和言语，使她害怕得要命。【注：（31）阿卡雅是古希腊的一个地区。这一段全是地理上的混乱。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mention of this last circumstance disturbed the archdeacon greatly, though Gringoire paid no attention to his perturbation; to such an extent had two months sufficed to cause the heedless poet to forget the singular details of the evening on which he had met the gypsy, and the presence of the archdeacon in it all. Otherwise, the little dancer feared nothing; she did not tell fortunes, which protected her against those trials for magic which were so frequently instituted against gypsy women. And then, Gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of her husband. After all, the philosopher endured this sort of platonic marriage very patiently. It meant a shelter and bread at least. Every morning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the gypsy; he helped her make her collections of targes and little blanks in the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her, allowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep of the just. A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery. And then, on his soul and conscience, the philosopher was not very sure that he was madly in love with the gypsy. He loved her goat almost as dearly. It was a charming animal, gentle, intelligent, clever; a learned goat. Nothing was more common in the Middle Ages than these learned animals, which amazed people greatly, and often led their instructors to the stake. But the witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic. Gringoire explained them to the archdeacon, whom these details seemed to interest deeply. In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the tambourine to the goat in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from him the trick desired. He had been trained to this by the gypsy, who possessed, in these delicate arts, so rare a talent that two months had sufficed to teach the goat to write, with movable letters, the word "Phoebus."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后这一点使得副主教非常尴尬，不过格兰古瓦没有十分注意，因为这位没脑子的诗人不过两个月的工夫就把那天夜里碰见埃及姑娘被掳掠的种种奇特情况、这一切里面总与副主教脱不了干系，忘得一干二净了。好在跳舞姑娘什么也不在乎，况且，她不给人算命，这样，她就不至于遭受当时经常加之于吉卜赛女人的诬告行妖作祟的审讯。格兰古瓦虽然谈不上是她的丈夫，倒也算得她的兄长。反正，这位哲学家对于这么一种柏拉图式的婚姻也还安心忍受。地方总是有得住的，面包总是有得吃的。每天早晨他从乞丐窝出去，通常总是跟爱斯美腊达一起，他帮她在市井通衢收敛鹰钱和小银币；每天晚上同她一起回到同一个住处，听任她把自己锁在隔壁那间小房里，然后他安安稳稳睡他的良心觉。他说，这生活整个来说，挺甜蜜的，也很有益于沉思冥想。还有，在他自己的灵魂深处，这位哲学家并不十分肯定自己爱这位吉卜赛姑娘达到疯狂的程度。他对山羊的爱，好像也不相上下。这只山羊又温柔，又聪明，又伶俐，真是可爱，是一只很懂事的山羊。这类叫人惊赞不置、常常使得驯养人遭受火刑的聪明动物，在中世纪真是比比皆是。这只金蹄山羊的妖术，其实完全是无害的噱头。格兰古瓦向副主教解释说，这些小玩艺儿好像是非常吸引人的。一般，只需要把手鼓递到山羊的面前，以某种方式翻动，就可以叫它变出所需要的戏法。是爱斯美腊达把它训练成这样的，而这个吉卜赛姑娘搞这些巧妙戏法的天才世上少有，只花了两个月的时间就教会了山羊用活字块拼组成Phœbus（孚比斯）。">查看中文翻译</div>
