<div class="line_en">The man on the roof was the first to die. He was crouched down by the chimney two hundred yards away, no more than a vague shadow in the predawn gloom, but as the sky began to lighten he stirred, stretched, and stood. Anguy's arrow took him in the chest. He tumbled bonelessly down the steep slate pitch, and fell in front of the septry door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya watched from atop her horse, on the crest of the wooded ridge that overlooked the septry, mill, brewhouse, and stables and the desolation of weeds, burnt trees, and mud that surrounded them. The trees were mostly bare now, and the few withered brown leaves that still clung to the branches did little to obstruct her view. Lord Beric had left Beardless Dick and Mudge to guard them. Arya hated being left behind like she was some stupid child, but at least Gendry had been kept back as well. She knew better than to try and argue. This was battle, and in battle you had to obey.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Mummers had posted two guards there, but their torch left them night blind, and the outlaws had crept in close. Kyle and Notch let fly together. One man went down with an arrow through his throat, the other through his belly. The second man dropped the torch, and the flames licked up at him. He screamed as his clothes took fire, and that was the end of stealth. Thoros gave a shout, and the outlaws attacked in earnest.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eastern horizon glowed gold and pink, and overhead a half moon peeked out through low scuttling clouds. The wind blew cold, and Arya could hear the rush of water and the creak of the mill's great wooden waterwheel. There was a smell of rain in the dawn air, but no drops were falling yet. Flaming arrows flew through the morning mists, trailing pale ribbons of fire, and thudded into the wooden walls of the septry. A few smashed through shuttered windows, and soon enough thin tendrils of smoke were rising between the broken shutters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="东方地平线上闪耀着金粉光芒，头顶半个月亮从低行疾走的云层中探出。寒风凛冽，艾莉亚听见水声和磨坊的大木轮发出的吱嘎响动。黎明的空气中有雨的气息，但没雨点落下。火箭穿过晨雾，留下丝带般的苍白轨迹，钉入圣堂的木墙。有些射穿了关闭的窄窗，缕缕薄烟很快从里面升起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two Mummers came bursting from the septry side by side, axes in their hands. Anguy and the other archers were waiting. One axeman died at once. The other managed to duck, so the shaft ripped through his shoulder. He staggered on, till two more arrows found him, so quickly it was hard to say which had struck first. The long shafts punched through his breastplate as if it had been made of silk instead of steel. He fell heavily. Anguy had arrows tipped with bodkins as well as broadheads. A bodkin could pierce even heavy plate. I'm going to learn to shoot a bow, Arya thought. She loved sword fighting, but she could see how arrows were good too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个血戏子手持战斧，并肩从圣堂里冲出。安盖和其他弓箭手正等着他们。一人当即毙命，另一人奋力伏低，因此只被射穿了肩膀。他跌跌撞撞地继续前进，很快又中两箭，速度之快，甚至无法辨别哪支先中。长箭杆贯穿铁胸甲，仿佛那是丝绸做的。他沉重地倒下。安盖用的箭箭头都绑着锥子，连板甲都防不住。我要学射箭，艾莉亚心想。她喜欢用剑，如今却明白了弓箭的好处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the septry erupted, the Mummers boiling out like angry ants. Two ibbenese rushed through the door with shaggy brown shields held high before them, and behind them came a Dothraki with a great curved arakh and bells in his braid, and behind him three Volantene sellswords covered with fierce tattoos. Others were climbing out windows and leaping to the ground. Arya saw a man take an arrow through the chest with one leg across a windowsill, and heard his scream as he fell. The smoke was thickening. Quarrels and arrows sped back and forth. Watty fell with a grunt, his bow slipping from his hand. Kyle was trying to nock another shaft to his string when a man in black mail flung a spear through his belly. She heard Lord Beric shout. From out of the ditches and trees the rest of his band came pouring, steel in hand. Arya saw Lem's bright yellow cloak flapping behind him as he rode down the man who'd killed Kyle. Thoros and Lord Beric were everywhere, their swords swirling fire. The red priest hacked at a hide shield until it flew to pieces, while his horse kicked the man in the face. A Dothraki screamed and charged the lightning lord, and the flaming sword leapt out to meet his arakh. The blades kissed and spun and kissed again. Then the Dothraki's hair was ablaze, and a moment later he was dead. She spied Ned too, fighting at the lightning lord's side. It's not fair, he's only a little older than me, they should have let me fight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紧接着，血戏子们像愤怒的蚂蚁一样冲出来，圣堂如同爆发的火山。两个伊班人夺门而出，高举毛绒的褐色盾牌，后面跟着一个手持巨大亚拉克弯刀的多斯拉克人，辫绑铃铛，再后面有三个覆满可怕刺青的瓦兰提斯佣兵。其他人从窗户爬出，跳到地上。艾莉亚看见有人一条腿刚跨过窗台，胸口便被射中，坠落时发出凄厉的惨叫。烟越来越浓。弩箭来回飞驰。瓦特闷哼一声，栽倒下去，弓从手中滑落。凯勒正在搭箭，却被一个黑甲人掷出的长矛刺穿了肚子。她听到贝里伯爵的喊叫，大部队手执兵器，自沟渠与树丛中一涌而上。柠檬鲜亮的黄斗篷在身后飞舞，他骑马冲出，砍倒杀死凯勒的人。索罗斯和贝里伯爵无处不在，两人剑上皆旋绕火焰。红袍僧朝一面皮盾猛砍，打得它四散飞裂，同时他的坐骑扬腿踢在执盾者脸上。一个多斯拉克人嘶叫着朝闪电大王扑来，火焰剑迎住亚拉克弯刀，刀剑交手数个回合，多斯拉克人的头发便着了火，很快人也死了。她瞥到艾德在闪电大王身边战斗。这不公平，他才比我大一点，他们应该让我也参战才对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Flames were creeping up the west wall of the septry, and thick smoke poured through a broken window. A Myrish crossbowman poked his head out a different window, got off a bolt, and ducked down to rewind. She could hear fighting from the stables as well, shouts well mingled with the screams of horses and the clang of steel. Kill them all, she thought fiercely. She bit her lip so hard she tasted blood. Kill every single one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火焰爬上圣堂西墙，浓烟从一扇破损的窗户中冒出。一个密尔十字弓手打另一扇窗户探出脑袋，射出一支飞失，然后蹲下去重新装填。她也听见马厩里的战斗，喊声，马嘶，金铁交击。把他们全杀光，她咬紧嘴唇，激动地想，甚至咬出血来，全杀光！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crossbowman appeared again, but no sooner had he loosed than three arrows hissed past his head. One rattled off his helm. He vanished, bow and all. Arya could see flames in several of the second-story windows. Between the smoke and the morning mists, the air was a haze of blowing black and white. Anguy and the other bowmen were creeping closer, the better to find targets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十字弓手再度出现，但刚发射，便有三支箭呼啸着飞过脑袋边，其中一支击中头盔。从此他便跟他的十字弓一起消失。艾莉亚看到二楼窗户里有火。翻滚的黑烟与白色晨雾中，一片朦胧模糊。安盖和其他弓箭手蹑手蹑脚地靠近，以利瞄准。">查看中文翻译</div>

They emerged from the smoke and flames a few moments later with eight brown brothers, one so weak that Merrit had to carry him across a shoulder. There was a septon with them as well, round-shouldered and balding, but he wore black chainmail over his grey robes. "Found him hiding under the cellar steps," said Jack, coughing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The battle did not last very long. The Brave Companions still on their feet soon died, or threw down their swords.

<div class="line_en">The trials went swiftly. Various of the outlaws came forward to tell of things the Brave Companions had done; towns and villages sacked, crops burned, women raped and murdered, men maimed and tortured. A few spoke of the boys that Septon Utt had carried off. The septon wept and prayed through it all. "I am a weak reed," he told Lord Beric. "I pray to the Warrior for strength, but the gods made me weak. Have mercy on my weakness. The boys, the sweet boys… I never mean to hurt them…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="审判进行得很快。土匪纷纷出来控诉勇士们的劣迹：洗劫城镇与村落，焚毁农获，奸杀妇女，摧残男人。有人说起被厄特修士带走的男孩，修士本人则一直哭泣祈祷。“我是一根软弱的芦苇，”他告诉贝里伯爵，“我向战士祈祷，请求他赐予力量，但神灵却让我心灵软弱。可怜可怜我这软弱的人儿吧。那些男孩，可爱的男孩…我根本不想伤害他们…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Septon Utt soon dangled beneath a tall elm, swinging slowly by the neck, as naked as his name day. The other Brave Companions followed one by one. A few fought, kicking and struggling as the noose was tightened round their throats. One of the crossbowmen kept shouting, "I soldier, I soldier," in a thick Myrish accent. Another offered to lead his captors to gold; a third told them what a good outlaw he would make. Each was stripped and bound and hanged in turn. Tom Sevenstrings played a dirge for them on his woodharp, and Thoros implored the Lord of Light to roast their souls until the end of time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，厄特修士被吊上一棵高大榆树，随脖子套的绳索缓缓摇摆，和出生时一样一丝不挂。其余“勇士”也一个一个地接受审判。绳索套上脖子时，有人试图反抗，边踢腿，边挣扎。有个十字弓手用浓重的密尔口音不停地喊，“我，当兵的，我，当兵的。”另一个提出带他们去找金子；还有一个保证会当一名出色的强盗。但最终个个都被扒光衣服，依次绑起来上吊。七弦汤姆用木竖琴为他们弹奏挽歌，索罗斯则祈求光之王焚烧他们的灵魂，直至时间尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A mummer tree, Arya thought as she watched them dangle, their pale skins painted a sullen red by the flames of the burning septry. Already the crows were coming, appearing out of nowhere. She heard them croaking and cackling at one another, and wondered what they were saying. Arya had not feared Septon Utt as much as she did Rorge and Biter and some of the others still at Harrenhal, but she was glad that he was dead all the same. They should have hanged the Hound too, or chopped his head off. Instead, to her disgust, the outlaws had treated Sandor Clegane's burned arm, restored his sword and horse and armor, and set him free a few miles from the hollow hill. All they'd taken was his gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一棵血戏子树，艾莉亚边看他们摇摆，边想，燃烧的圣堂为他们苍白的皮肤蒙上一层阴沉的红色。不知什么时候，不知从什么地方，乌鸦已经来了，她听它们互相喋喋不休地聒噪，很想知道在说些什么。艾莉亚不大怕厄特修士，不像怕罗尔杰、尖牙和其他一些仍在赫伦堡的人，但他的死还是让她很高兴。他们也该吊死猎狗，或者砍他的脑袋。然而令她反感的是，他们反给桑铎·克里冈治疗烧伤的手臂，归还了他的剑、马和盔甲，在距离空山数里处把他释放，拿走的只有他的钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The septry soon collapsed in a roar of smoke and flame, its walls no longer able to support the weight of its heavy slate roof. The eight brown brothers watched with resignation. They were all that remained, explained the eldest, who wore a small iron hammer on a thong about his neck to signify his devotion to the Smith. "Before the war we were four-and-forty, and this was a prosperous place. We had a dozen milk cows and a bull, a hundred beehives, a vineyard and an apple arbor. But when the lions came through they took all our wine and milk and honey, slaughtered the cows, and put our vineyard to the torch. After that… I have lost count of our visitors. This false septon was only the latest. There was one monster… we gave him all our silver, but he was certain we were hiding gold, so his men killed us one by one to make Elder Brother talk."</div>

<div class="line_en">The outlaws sheltered that night in the brewhouse beside the little river. Their hosts had a cache of food hidden beneath the floor of the stables, so they shared a simple supper; oaten bread, onions, and a watery cabbage soup tasting faintly of garlic. Arya found a slice of carrot floating in her bowl, and counted herself lucky. The brothers never asked the outlaws for names. They know, Arya thought. How could they not? Lord Beric wore the lightning bolt on breastplate, shield, and cloak, and Thoros his red robes, or what remained of them. One brother, a young novice, was bold enough to tell the red priest not to pray to his false god so long as he was under their roof. "Bugger that," said Lem Lemoncloak. "He's our god too, and you owe us for your bloody lives. And what's false about him? Might be your Smith can mend a broken sword, but can he heal a broken man?"</div>

The Marcher lord was still clad in his ratty black cloak and dented breastplate with its chipped enamel lightning. He even slept in that breastplate. The dull black steel hid the terrible wound the Hound had given him, the same way his thick woolen scarf concealed the dark ring about his throat.

Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei." Arya tried to imagine how they would look when they were dead, but it was hard to bring their faces to mind.
