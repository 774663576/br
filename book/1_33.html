<div class="line_en">And what she had been through these last two hours! It started with Sophie trying to attract the major's attention on the way home from the cabin in the woods. She had finally climbed a tree and been rescued by Morten Goose, who had arrived like a guardian angel from Lebanon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两个小时内发生的事可真多呀。最先是苏菲在从林间小木屋回家的路上努力要引起少校的注意力。最后她爬到一棵树上，然后被大雁莫通给救了。那只雁是从黎巴嫩飞来的，仿佛是她的守护天使一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Sophie had her first experience as a lone customer in a cafe. Hilde had been especially taken with what Alberto said about Sartre and existentialism. He had almost managed to convert her -- although he had done that many times before in the ring binder too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来苏菲第一次体验到独自一人上咖啡厅的滋味。席德对艾伯特讲的萨特和存在主义的事特别感兴趣。他几乎让她变成了一个存在主义者。不过，话说回来，他过去也有好几次曾经这样过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, about a year ago, Hilde had bought a book on astrology. Another time she had come home with a set of tarot cards. Next time it was a book on spiritualism. Each time, her father had lectured her about "superstition" and her "critical faculty," but he had waited until now for the final blow. His counterattack was deadly accurate. Clearly, his daughter would not be allowed to grow up without a thorough warning against that kind of thing. To be absolutely sure, he had waved to her from a TV screen in a radio store. He could have saved himself the trouble…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约一年前，席德买了一本占星学的书，还有一次她拿了一组意大利纸牌回家，后来又有一次她买了一本有关招魂术的书。每一次，爸爸总是跟她说一些什么“迷信”呀、“批判的能力”呀等等道理，但他一直等到现在才来“绝地大反攻”。他的反击可说是正中要害。很明显的，他想在他的女儿长大之前彻彻底底警告她那些东西的害处。为了安全起见，他安排了他从电器商店的电视屏幕上对她挥手的场面。其实他大可不必这样的…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally Sophie had been given a book about herself. Was it the same book that Hilde now had in her hands? This was only a ring binder. But even so -- how could one find a book about oneself in a book about oneself? What would happen if Sophie began to read that book?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，艾伯特给了苏菲一本有关她自己的书。那本书是否就是席德现在手上拿的这一本呢？当然，这只是一个讲义夹。但即使是这样，一个人怎么可能在一本有关他自己的书里面发现一本有关他自己的书呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The table was set with chicken, salad, and different kinds of homemade bread. In the kitchen there were raisin buns and layer cake, Danish pastry and chocolate cake. But from the start the place of honor in the center of the table was reserved for the birthday cake -- a pyramid of almond-paste rings. On the top of the cake was the tiny figure of a girl in a confirmation dress. Sophie's mother had assured her that it could just as well represent an unconfirmed fifteen-year-old, but Sophie was certain her mother had only put it there because Sophie had told her she was not sure she wanted to be confirmed. Her mother seemed to think the cake embodied the confirmation itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="餐桌上摆了鸡、沙拉和各式各样的自制面包。厨房里还有葡萄面包和双层蛋糕、丹麦酥和巧克力蛋糕。可是打从一开始，餐桌上最中央的位置就保留给生日蛋糕。那是一个由杏仁圈饼做成的金字塔。在蛋糕的尖顶，有一个穿着坚信礼服装的小女孩图案。苏菲的妈妈曾向她保证那个图案也可以代表一个没有受坚信礼的十五岁女孩，可是苏菲相信妈妈之所以把它放在那儿，是因为苏菲说她不确定自己是不是想受坚信礼。而妈妈似乎认为那个蛋糕就象征坚信礼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everybody had brought birthday presents, and as it was a philosophical garden party, several of the guests had tried to find out what philosophy was. Although not all of them had managed to find philosophical presents, most of them had written something philosophical on their cards. Sophie received a philosophical dictionary as well as a diary with a lock; on the cover was written MY PERSONAL PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHTS. As the guests arrived they were served apple juice in long-stemmed wine glasses. Sophie's mother did the serving.</div>

<div class="line_en">When all the younger guests had arrived and were strolling under the trees with their wine glasses, Joanna's parents drew up at the garden gate in a white Mercedes. The financial adviser was impeccably dressed in an expensively cut gray suit. His wife was wearing a red pants suit with dark red sequins. Sophie was sure she had bought a Barbie doll in a toy store dressed in that suit, and had a tailor make it up in her size. There was another possibility; the financial adviser could have bought the doll and given it to a magician to make into a live woman. But this possibility was unlikely, so Sophie rejected it.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she returned with the coffee, the garden party looked more like a children's party than a young woman's philosophical celebration. Several soda bottles had been knocked over on the table, there was chocolate cake smeared all over the tablecloth and the dish of raisin buns lay upside down on the lawn. Just as Sophie arrived, one of the boys put a firecracker to the layer cake, which exploded all over the table and the guests. The worst casualty was Mrs. Ingebrigtsen's red pants suit. The curious thing was that both she and everybody else took it with the utmost calm. Joanna picked up a huge piece of chocolate cake, smeared it all over Jeremy's face, and proceeded to lick it off again.</div>
