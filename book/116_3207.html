<div class="line_en">One sunny morning in June, early in the 1800s, Miss Amelia Sedley and Miss Rebecca Sharp left school. The carriage which took them away from Miss Pinkerton's school for young ladies was filled with gifts and flowers for Amelia, for everyone loved her; but nobody cried when Rebecca left.</div>

<div class="line_en">We are going to see a great deal of Amelia, so there is no harm in saying straight away that she was a dear little creature. She is not a heroine because her nose was rather short and her face was too round, though it shone with rosy health. She had a lovely smile and her eyes were bright with good humour, except when they were filled with tears, which happened a great deal too often because she had the kindest heart in the world. And when she left school she did not know whether to cry or not. She was glad to go home, but she was very sad to leave her friends at school.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her father was an artist, who had given drawing lessons to the young ladies at Miss Pinkerton's school. He was a clever man and a pleasant companion, but was always in debt and had too great a fondness for the bottle. When he was drunk, he used to beat his wife and daughter.

<div class="line_en">Rebecca, or Becky, as she was often called, was small and thin, with a pale face and light red hair. She usually kept her head down, but when she looked up, her green eyes were large and attractive, especially to men. Next to the tall, healthy young ladies in the school, Becky Sharp looked like a child. But being poor and in debt had taught her many adult lessons. She knew how to deal with angry shopkeepers demanding their money, and how to charm them into providing one more meal. Her father, who was very proud of her lively mind, had liked to have her at his drinking parties, though the conversation of his wild friends was hardly suitable for a young girl. But she had never been a girl, she said; she had been a woman since she was eight years old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丽贝卡，大家也常常叫她贝姬，身材瘦小，脸色苍白，长着一头淡红色的头发。她通常低着头，可是当她抬起眼来时，那双绿眼睛显得又大又迷人，对男性尤其有吸引力。和学校里高挑健康的年轻小姐们站在一起，贝姬·夏普看起来就像个小孩子。然而，家境贫寒又债务缠身，使她学会了许多成年人才知道的诀窍：她知道怎么应付那些来讨钱的凶巴巴的店主，也知道怎么打动他们，让他们再多提供一顿饭。她的父亲非常赞赏她那灵活的头脑，喜欢在找人喝酒时把她带上，可是他那帮狐朋狗友讲的话实在不适合年轻女孩听。然而，她说她从来没当过女孩，从八岁起她就是一位成年女子了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rebecca hated the school. She argued and fought with Miss Pinkerton, and was jealous of the young ladies there. After the freedom of her father's house, the school felt like a prison, and she was soon making plans for her escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丽贝卡讨厌平克顿女子学校。她与平克顿小姐争吵不休，对学校里的年轻小姐们嫉妒不已。她在父亲家里过惯了自由的生活，学校简直就像一座监狱，因此她很快就开始计划如何摆脱学校的束缚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her only friend was Amelia Sedley, and when Amelia left school at the age of seventeen, Rebecca, now aged nineteen, left school too.

<div class="line_en">By the time the carriage arrived at the Sedleys' house in Russell Square, Amelia had forgotten her sadness and was happy to be home again.

<div class="line_cn" title="等马车到了位于拉塞尔广场的塞德利家门口时，阿梅莉亚已将悲伤抛在脑后，因回到家而高兴起来。她兴致勃勃地带着丽贝卡参观每个房间，展示她的钢琴、书籍、衣服、珠宝以及她的哥哥约瑟夫从印度为她带回来的各种精美礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the thought that was really going through Rebecca's mind was this: "If Mr Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried, why shouldn't I marry him? I have only a few weeks, to be sure, but there's no harm in trying."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但实际上丽贝卡脑子里想的是：“既然约瑟夫·塞德利先生富有且又未婚，我为什么不嫁给他呢？不错，我只有几个星期的时间，但试试也无妨。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Should we blame Miss Sharp for her marriage ambitions? No, for we must remember that poor Rebecca had no kind mother to arrange this delicate business for her, and that if she did not get a husband for herself, there was no one else to do it for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们应该谴责夏普小姐的结婚大计吗？不，因为我们须记着，可怜的丽贝卡没有体贴的母亲为她安排这桩棘手之事。如果她不为自己寻觅夫君的话，别人是不会为她操办婚事的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Joseph Sedley was twelve years older than his sister, and worked in Bengal, in a very isolated place, for the East India Company. But he became ill, and was sent back to London, where he decided to enjoy all the pleasures he had missed when he went to India. So he had his own apartment, drove his horses in the park, ate in fashionable restaurants, and went to the theatre. But he had no friends. He was fat, lazy, and vain, and the sight of a lady frightened him tremendously.</div>

<div class="line_en">Becky Sharp would have to be very clever indeed to catch such a man for a husband. Her first moves, though, showed considerable skill.

<div class="line_en">"He's a fine fellow," said George, "even if he's not very good-looking." And he glanced towards the mirror, admiring his own handsome face and curly black hair.

<div class="line_cn" title="“他人不错，”乔治说，“虽然他长得不怎么好看。”他朝镜子望去，欣赏自己英俊的脸庞和卷曲的黑发。看到丽贝卡在端详他，他脸红了一下。丽贝卡心想：“你当然知道自己 是个多么漂亮的人儿啦，不是吗！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the way to Vauxhall Gardens, Rebecca sat next to Joseph in the carriage and George Osborne sat between Amelia and Dobbin. Though nothing was said, everybody in the carriage was sure that Joseph would propose to Becky that evening. And when they stepped down from the carriage, Joseph took her on his arm, and George and Amelia went off together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在前往沃克斯霍尔花园的马车上，丽贝卡挨着约瑟夫坐，乔治·奥斯本坐在阿梅莉亚和多宾中间。尽管一言不发，但马车上的人都肯定约瑟夫当晚会向贝姬求婚。他们下马车时，约瑟夫让丽贝卡挽着自己的手臂，乔治和阿梅莉亚则结伴前行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dobbin paid for them all, and then walked behind, content in his generous and unselfish way to see Amelia and George so happy together. They had all promised to stay together, but within ten minutes, of course, they had separated, and Rebecca found herself alone with Joseph on one of the side walks. Now, she thought, was the moment for Joseph to ask the question. A few minutes earlier somebody had rudely pushed past Rebecca, and she had fallen back with a little cry, into Mr Sedley's arms. This made him feel very loving towards her, and he told her several of his Indian stories again -- for the sixth time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多宾为大家付了钱，跟着走在后面。看到阿梅莉亚和乔治在一起那么开心，慷慨无私的他觉得心满意足。他们本来说好要一起行动的，但结果不出所料，不到十分钟他们就分开了。丽贝卡发现她和约瑟夫单独走在一条小路上。现在，她想，约瑟夫该问那个问题了。就在几分钟前，有人粗鲁地从丽贝卡身边挤过去，她轻声尖叫，跌进塞德利先生的怀里。这使他对她的爱意更浓了，于是他又讲了几个他在印度的故事——这已经是第六遍了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Captain Dobbin walked round the Gardens alone. He thought of joining the others for supper, but saw, when he passed in front of their table, that they were all talking happily to each other, and that their table was prepared for four only. They had forgotten all about him, so he went away again. When he returned later, he realized that Joseph had drunk too much, for he was talking and laughing and singing very loudly. He had attracted a crowd of people, who were gathering round to watch. In fact, George was just about to hit one man who wanted to join the party, but Dobbin arrived at that moment and sent the crowd away.</div>

<div class="line_en">But wine can be the ruin of marriage plans. The next day Joseph had a terrible headache, and his condition was not improved by a visit from George Osborne, who laughed at him most unkindly. "What a fool you made of yourself last night, Jos! Singing love songs, and crying all over Miss Sharp's hand!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是酒也能成为破坏婚姻计划的罪魁。次日约瑟夫头痛得厉害，乔治·奥斯本的来访也没能让情况好转。他对约瑟夫大肆嘲笑，刻薄极了。“你昨晚出了多大的洋相啊，乔斯！唱情歌，还拉着夏普小姐的手痛哭流涕！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The result of all this was that Joseph decided that he was too ill to visit the young ladies, and the next day he sent a letter to his sister, saying that when he recovered he planned to go to Scotland for several months.</div>

Kind-hearted Amelia was very sad for her friend and cried a great deal, but it was now clear to the rest of the Sedley family that the time had come for Rebecca to leave.

Even George Osborne gave Rebecca a present, but he had made too many unkind jokes about Joseph and the Vauxhall party.</div>
