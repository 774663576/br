<div class="line_en">Sometimes, a light glimmered out of the physician's eyes, burning blue and ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or, let us say, like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from Bunyan's awful doorway in the hill-side, and quivered on the pilgrim's face. The soil where this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that encouraged him.</div>

<div class="line_en">OLD Roger Chillingworth, throughout life, had been calm in temperament, kindly, though not of warm affections, but ever, and in all his relations with the world, a pure and upright man. He had begun an investigation, as he imagined, with the severe and equal integrity of a judge, desirous only of truth, even as if the question involved no more than the air-drawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem, instead of human passions, and wrongs inflicted on himself. But, as he proceeded, a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though still calm, necessity seized the old man within its gripe, and never set him free again, until he had done all its bidding. He now dug into the poor clergyman's heart, like a miner searching for gold; or, rather, like a sexton delving into a grave, possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead man's bosom, but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption. Alas for his own soul, if these were what he sought!</div>

<div class="line_en">"This man," said he, at one such moment, to himself, "pure as they deem him -- all spiritual as he seems -- hath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother. Let us dig a little farther in the direction of this vein!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个人，”他在一次这种场合中自言自语说，“尽管人们相信他很纯洁，尽管他看来极其高尚神圣，但他从他父亲或母亲身上继承了一种强烈的兽性。让我们沿着这一矿脉再向前掘进一点吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, after long search into the minister's dim interior, and turning over many precious materials, in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race, warm love of souls, pure sentiments, natural piety, strengthened by thought and study, and illuminated by revelation -- all of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seeker -- he would turn back, discouraged, and begin his quest towards another point. He groped along as stealthily, with as cautious a tread, and as wary an outlook, as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleep -- or, it may be, broad awake-with purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye. In spite of his premeditated carefulness, the floor would now and then creak; his garments would rustle; the shadow of his presence, in a forbidden proximity, would be thrown across his victim. In other words, Mr. Dimmesdale, whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition, would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him. But old Roger Chillingworth, too, had perceptions that were almost intuitive; and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him, there the physician sat; his kind, watchful, sympathising, but never intrusive friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，他就对这位牧师的幽暗的内心加以长时间的搜寻，翻出了许多宝资的东西，都是由思想和钻研而强化的、由天启而燃亮的，诸如对灵魂的热爱、纯洁的情操、自然的虔诚等等，均以对人类的福祉的高尚志向为其形式——然而这一切无价之宝于那位探矿人无异于一堆废物——他只好沮丧地转回身来，朝着另一个方向开始寻求。他鬼鬼祟祟，左顾右盼，小心翼翼地向前探索，犹如一个偷儿进入一间卧室，想去窃取主人视如服珠的宝物，而主人却躺在那里半睡半醒——或者可能还大睁着眼睛。尽管他事先策划周密，但地板会不时吱嘎作响，他的衣服也会细碎有声。而且到了，近在咫尺的禁地，他的身影也会投射到被窃人的身上。另一方面，丁梅斯代尔先生的敏感的神经时常会产生一种精神直觉的功效，他会模模糊糊地意识到，对他的平静抱有敌意的某种东西已经同他发生了关联。面老罗杰·齐灵渥斯也具备近乎直觉的感知能力；当牧师向他投来惊恐的目光时，医生就会坐在那里，成了关切和同情牧师的好心朋友，绝不打探他的隐私了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那又为什么呢？”医生接口说。“既然一切自然力量都这么诚挚地要求仟侮罪过，连这些黑色杂草都从死者的心中生长出来，宣布了一桩没有说出口的罪行，为什么办不到呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在哪儿，”他斜眼看着那簇植物开口问道——最近牧师有个特点，他很少直视任何东西，不管是人还是无生命的——“我好心的朋友，你在哪儿搜集到的这些药草，叶子这么黝黑松软？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"These men deceive themselves," said Roger Chillingworth, with somewhat more emphasis than usual, and making a slight gesture with his forefinger. "They fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them. Their love for man, their zeal for God's service -- these holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door, and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them. But, if they seek to glorify God, let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands! If they would serve their fellow-men, let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience, in constraining them to penitential self-abasement! Wouldst thou have me to believe, O wise and pious friend, that a false show can be better -- can be more for God's glory, or man's welfare -- than God's own truth? Trust me, such men deceive themselves!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些人在自欺，”罗杰·齐灵渥斯用异乎寻常的强调口吻说，还伸出食指轻轻比了一下。“他们不敢于接受理应属于他们自己的耻辱。他们对人类的爱，他们为上帝服务的热忱——这种种神圣的冲动在他们的内心中，或者可以或者无法同邪恶的伙伴同处共存，然而这些邪恶的伙伴既是他们的罪孽开门放进来的，就必然会在他们心中繁衍起一个魔鬼的种籽。不过，要是他们追求为上帝增辉添光，那就不要把肮脏的双手朝天举起吧！要是他们想为同伴们服务，那就先强制自己仟悔他们的卑下，以表明良心的力量和存在吧！噢，明智和虔诚的朋友，你难道让我相信，虚伪的表现比起上帝自己的真理能够对上帝的荣光和人类的福扯更有好处吗？相信我吧，这种人是在自欺！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They mostly do," said the clergyman, griping hard at his breast, as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain. "Many, many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me, not only on the deathbed, but while strong in life, and fair in reputation. And ever, after such an outpouring, oh, what a relief have I witnessed in those sinful brethren! even as in one who at last draws free air, after long stifling with his own polluted breath. How can it be otherwise? Why should a wretched man, guilty, we will say, of murder, prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart, rather than fling it forth at once, and let the universe take care of it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们大多能这么做，”牧师一边说着，一边紧紧捂住自己的心口，象是有揪心的疼痛纠缠着他。“许许多多可怜的灵魂向我作过仟悔，不仅是在生命弥留的病倔上，而且也在精力旺盛、名声良好的时刻。何况，我还亲眼看到，在作了这样一番倾诉之后，那些负罪的兄弟们有多么轻松！就象是被自己污浊的呼吸长时间窒息之后，终于吸进了自由的空气。还能是别的情况吗？一个倒霉的人，比如说犯了谋杀罪吧，怎么可能宁愿把死尸埋在自己心中，而不肯把尸体马上抛出去，听凭世界去安排呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It may be so," said the young clergyman, indifferently, as waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable. He had a ready faculty, indeed, of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperament. "But, now, I would ask of my well-skilled physician, whether, in good sooth, he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可能是这样的，”年轻的牧师谈淡地说，象是放弃了这个他认为不相干和没道理的讨论。的确，他总有一种本领，能够随时摆脱使他那过于敏感和神经质的气质激动起来的任何话题。“不过，目前嘛，我例要向我的技艺高超的医生讨教一下，他对我的赢弱的体格的好心关照，是否当真叫我获益了呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Roger Chillingworth could answer, they heard the clear, wild laughter of a young child's voice, proceeding from the adjacent burial-ground. Looking instinctively from the open window -- for it was summer-time -- the minister beheld Hester Prynne and little Pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure. Pearl looked as beautiful as the day, but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which, whenever they occurred, seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact. She now skipped irreverently from one grave to another; until, coming to the broad, flat, armorial tombstone of a departed worthy -- perhaps of Isaac Johnson himself -- she began to dance upon it. In reply to her mother's command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously, little Pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb. Taking a handful of these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as their nature was, tenaciously adhered. Hester did not pluck them off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗杰·齐灵渥斯还没有来得及回答，就听到从邻近的墓地里传来了一个小孩子的清澈而狂野的笑声。当时正是夏天，牧师不自主地从打开的窗子向外面望去，看到海丝特·白兰和小珠儿在穿越围栏的小径上走着。珠儿的模样如白昼一般美丽，但处于那种调皮任性的兴致之中，每当此刻，她便象完全脱离了人性的共鸣与交往的范围。此时她正大不敬地从一个坟墓跳到另一个坟墓；终于来到一位逝去的大人物——说不定正是艾萨克，约翰逊本人——的宽大、平整、带纹章的墓石跟前，在那上面跳起舞来。听到她母亲又是命令又是恳求地要她放规矩些，小珠儿才不再跳舞，从长在墓旁的一株高大的牛蒡上采集多刺的果实。她摘了满满一把之后，便在缀在母亲胸前的红字周围，沿着笔画一一插满，这些带刺的牛蒡便牢牢地扎在上面了。海丝特并没有把它们取下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"None -- save the freedom of a broken law," answered Mr. Dimmesdale, in a quiet way, as if he had been discussing the point within himself. "Whether capable of good I know not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“完全没有——只有把法律破坏得支离破碎的自由，”丁梅斯代尔先生回答说，其态度之安详，简直象是对此自问自答。“至于能否为善，我可就不得而知了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Roger Chillingworth had by this time approached the window, and smiled grimly down. "There is no law, nor reverence for authority, no regard for human ordinances or opinions, right or wrong, mixed up with that child's composition," remarked her, as much to himself as to his companion. "I saw her, the other day, bespatter the Governor himself with water, at the cattle-trough in Spring Lane. What, in Heaven's name, is she? Is the imp altogether evil? Hath she affections? Hath she any discoverable principle of being?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗杰·齐灵渥斯这时已走到窗前，面带狞笑地向下望着。“在那孩子的气质中，根本没有法律，没有对权威的敬重，对于人类的法令或意向，不管正确与否，也不屑一顾，”他这样讲着，与其说是在同他的同伴谈话，倒更象是自言自语。“有一天，我看到她在春巷的畜槽边，竟然往总督身上泼水。我的天，她究竟是个什么东西呢？这小鬼是不是彻头彻尾地邪恶了？她有感情吗？在她身上能看到什么人性原则吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The child probably overheard their voices; for, looking up to the window, with a bright, but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence, she threw one of the prickly burrs at the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. The sensitive clergyman shrunk, with nervous dread, from the light missile. Detecting his emotion, Pearl clapped her little hands, in the most extravagant ecstasy. Hester Prynne, likewise, had involuntarily looked up; and all these four persons, old and young, regarded one another in silence, till the child laughed aloud, and shouted, "Come away, mother! Come away, or yonder old Black Man will catch you! He hath got hold of the minister already. Come away, mother, or he will catch you! But he cannot catch little Pearl!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那孩子可能是远远听到了他俩的声音；因为她抬头看着窗户，面带欢快而聪明的顽皮笑容，朝丁梅斯代尔牧师先生扔上一颗带刺的牛蒡。那敏感的牧师怀着神经质的恐惧，将身子一缩，躲开了那轻飘的飞弹。珠儿发现了他的激动，在极度狂喜之中，拍起了小手。海丝特·白兰也同样禁不住始眼来看；于是这老老少少四个人便默默地互相瞅着；后来，孩子出声笑了，还大叫着——“走吧，妈妈！走吧，要不，那老黑人就抓住你了！他已经抓住了牧师。走吧，妈妈，要不他就抓住你了！可他抓不住小珠儿！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do verily believe it," answered the clergyman. "Nevertheless, I cannot answer for her.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我的确十分相信这一点，”牧师回答说。“不过我无法为她作答。她面孔上有一种痛楚的表情，那是我不情愿看到的。话说回来，我认为，一个受折磨的人能够象这可怜的妇人海丝特这样，有自由来表达自己的痛苦，总比全都闷在心里要强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There goes a woman," resumed Roger Chillingworth, after a pause, "who, be her demerits what they may, hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne.

Looking dally at you, my good sir, and watching the tokens of your aspect, now for months gone by, I should deem you a man sore sick, it may be, yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you.

<div class="line_en">"You would tell me, then, that I know all?" said Roger Chillingworth deliberately, and fixing an eye, bright with intense and concentrated intelligence, on the minister's face. "Be it so! But, again! He to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open, knoweth, oftentimes, but half the evil which be is called upon to cure. A bodily disease, which we look upon as whole and entire within itself, may, after all, be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part. Your pardon, once again, good sir, if my speech give the shadow of offence.

<div class="line_cn" title="“迈出这一步倒也好，”罗杰·齐灵涯斯望着牧师的背影，阴沉地一笑，自言自语地说。“一无所失。我们很快还会重新成为朋友的。不过看看吧，如今，激情如何完全左右了这个人，让他无法自主了！这种激情能如此，另一种激情当然也一样！这位。虚诚的丁梅斯代尔牧师，以前也曾在他内心热烈的激情的驱使之下，于出过荒唐事的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It proved not difficult to re-establish the intimacy of the two companions, on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore. The young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy, was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper, which there had been nothing in the physician's words to excuse or palliate. He marvelled, indeed, at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man, when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow, and which the minister himself had expressly sought. With these remorseful feelings, he lost no time in making the amplest apologies, and besought his friend still to continue the care, which, if not successful in restoring him to health, had, in all probability, been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour. Roger Chillingworth readily assented, and went on with his medical supervision of the minister; doing his best for him, in all good faith, but always quitting the patient's apartment, at the close of a professional interview, with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips. This expression was invisible in Mr. Dimmesdale's presence, but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实证明，在这两个伙伴之间，同以往一样，在同一基础上重建同一程度的亲密关系，并不困难。年轻的牧师经过数小时独处之后，意识到自己神经的失调促使他出现了不自觉的大发脾气，其实，从医生的言谈话语之中丝毫找不出为自己辩解或掩饰的借口。他确实为自己对那善良的老人粗暴的发泄感到惊讶，人家不过是在尽职尽责地忠言相劝，何况也正是牧师他本人所求之不得的呢；他怀着懊悔不选曲心情，迫不及待地去向医生赔礼道歉，并请他这位朋友继续为他诊治，即使没有成功地恢复他的健康，但总算把他的病弱之躯维系到目前嘛。罗杰·齐灵渥斯欣然同意，并继续为牧师进行医疗监督；他诚心诚意地尽力而为，但在每次诊视之后，总要在嘴上带着神秘而迷惑的笑意，离开病人的房间。医生的这一表情在丁梅斯代尔先生面前是看不出的，但他穿过前厅时就变得十分明显了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It came to pass, not long after the scene above recorded, that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, at noon-day, and entirely unawares, fell into a deep, deep slumber, sitting in his chair, with a large black-letter volume open before him on the table. It must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature. The profound depth of the minister's repose was the more remarkable, inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep, ordinarily, is as light, as fitful, and as easily scared away, as a small bird hopping on a twig. To such an unwonted remoteness, however, had his spirit now withdrawn into itself, that he stirred not in his chair, when old Roger Chillingworth, without any extraordinary precaution, came into the room. The physician advanced directly in front of his patient, laid his hand upon his bosom, and thrust aside the vestment, that, hitherto, had always covered it even from the professional eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在上述那场面发生之后不久的一天正午，丁梅斯代尔牧师先生毫不知觉地陷入了沉睡之中，他坐在椅子上，前面的桌上摊开一大本黑皮的书卷。那准是一部催眠派文献中卓有功效的作品。象牧师这样的深沉酣睡，尤其值得注意，因为他属于那种通常睡眠极轻、时断时续，如同在嫩枝上雀跃的小鸟般极易受惊的人。无论如何，他这种非同寻常的酣睡，已经让他的精神完全收缩到自己的天地，以致当老罗杰·齐灵渥斯并没有特别蹑手蹑脚地走进他的房间时，他居然没有在椅子里惊动一下。医生直接走到他的病人跟前，把手放在牧师的胸口，扯开到目前为止连诊视时都没解开过的法衣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But, with what a wild look of wonder, joy, and horror! With what a ghastly rapture, as it were, too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features, and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure, and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling, and stamped his foot upon the floor! Had a man seen old Roger Chillingworth, at that moment of his ecstasy, he would have had no need to ask how Satan comports himself, when a precious human soul is lost to heaven, and won into his kingdom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，他却带有一种多么狂野的惊奇、欢乐和恐惧的表情网！事实上，他的那种骇人的狂喜，绝不仅仅是由跟睛和表情所能表达的，因之要从他整个的丑陋身躯进发出来，他将两臂伸向天花板，一只脚使劲跺着地面，以这种非同寻常的姿态来益发放纵地表现他的狂喜！若是有人看到老罗杰·齐灵渥斯此时的忘乎所以，他就不必去询问：当一个宝贵的人类灵魂失去了天国，堕入撤旦的地狱之中时，那魔王该如何举动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
