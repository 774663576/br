<div class="line_en">I left Insomnia Lodge next morning around eight and spent some time in Parkington. Visions of bungling the execution kept obsessing me. Thinking that perhaps the cartridges in the automatic had gone stale during a week of inactivity, I removed them and inserted a fresh batch. Such a thorough oil bath did I give Chum that now I could not get rid of the stuff. I bandaged him up with a rag, like a maimed limb, and used another rag to wrap up a handful of spare bullets.</div>

<div class="line_en">A thunderstorm accompanied me most of the way back to Grimm Road, but when I reached Pavor Manor, the sun was visible again, burning like a man, and the birds screamed in the drenched and steaming trees. The elaborate and decrepit house seemed to stand in a kind of daze, reflecting as it were my own state, for I could not help realizing, as my feet touched the springy and insecure ground, that I had overdone the alcoholic stimulation business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回格里姆的一路上，暴风雨陪我行了大半程，到佩沃庄园时，太阳又露出笑脸，火烧火燎，鸟儿在湿漉漉的树林里嘁嘁喳喳地欢叫。那幢设计精巧，略显陈旧的房屋仿佛立在冥冥的梦中，就如同我的大脑；因为当我的双脚踏上这片松 软、不安全的土地时，我禁不住意识到，我的酒精刺激做得太过份了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A guardedly ironic silence answered my bell. The garage, however, was loaded with his car, a black convertible for the nonce. I tried the knocker. Re-nobody. With a petulant snarl, I pushed the front door -- and, how nice, it swung open as in a medieval fairy tale. Having softly closed it behind me, I made my way across a spacious and very ugly hall; peered into an adjacent drawing room; noticed a number of used glasses growing out of the carpet; decided that master was still asleep in the master bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于我按门铃的回答，是一阵谨慎，嘲讽性的寂静。不过车房里停着他的车，一辆黑色的敞篷车。我试着碰了下门环，仍是无人。我怒气冲冲低吼了一声便去推门——真太妙了，门竟“吱”地开了，象中世纪的童话故事。我在身后轻轻将门带上，穿过一个宽敞、丑陋的大厅，同时使劲往邻近的起居室里看，看见许多用过的玻璃杯散落在地毯上。我断定主人仍在主人的卧室里蒙头大睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Speaking of bathrooms -- I was about to visit a third one when master came out of it, leaving a brief waterfall behind him. The corner of a passage did not quite conceal me. Gray-faced, baggy-eyed, fluffily disheveled in a scanty balding way, but still perfectly recognizable, he swept by me in a purple bathrobe, very like one I had. He either did not notice me, or else dismissed me as some familiar and innocuous hallucination -- and, showing me his hairy calves, he proceeded, sleepwalker-wise, downstairs. I pocketed my last key and followed him into the entrance hall. He had half opened his mouth and the front door, to peer out through a sunny chink as one who thinks he has heard a half-hearted visitor ring and recede. Then, still ignoring the raincoated phantasm that had stopped in midstairs, master walked into a cozy boudoir across the hall from the drawing room, through which -- taking it easy, knowing he was safe -- I now went away from him, and in a bar-adorned kitchen gingerly unwrapped dirty Chum, taking care not to leave any oil stains on the chrome -- I think I got the wrong product, it was black and awfully messy. In my usual meticulous way, I transferred naked Chum to a clean recess about me and made for the little boudoir. My step, as I say, was springy -- too springy perhaps for success. But my heart pounded with tiger joy, and I crunched a cocktail glass underfoot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到浴室——我刚要去查第三间，主人就浑身湿淋淋地从里面出来了，身后留下一条细细的水流。走廊里的那个椅角根本藏不住我。他脸色青灰，眼睑松驰，几根稀疏的头发乱糟糟的，但他还是能被认出来，准确无误；他从我身边扫过，穿着一件紫红色的浴衣，和我那件很相象。他没发现我，要么就是当我是什么熟悉的，不关痛痒的幻象没理我——他继续往前走，给我看到他那毛茸茸的小腿，象个梦游者，下了楼。我把最后一把钥匙揣进口袋，尾随他到了门口。他半张着嘴，半开着前门，从一条阳光的缝隙里偷偷往外看，那，神态就好象他认为他听见了一个不那么热诚的来访者按了门铃又溜走了。然后，仍然不去理会那个停在楼梯上穿着雨衣的幽灵，主人从客厅穿过大厅走进一间小巧、舒适的内室；我则穿过客厅———放宽了心，知道他跑不掉了——离开他，到一个装饰得很象酒吧一样的厨房里，小心翼翼揭开油腻腻的丘姆，谨慎地别把油蹭在铬壳上——我觉得我是上错了油，它怎么乌涂涂的，脏得可怕。与往常一样，我一丝不苟地把赤裸裸的丘姆装进我随身携带的一个干净套里，然后直奔那个小房间。我想说，我的脚步很轻快——很可能太轻快了，也许不会成功。但我的心砰砰乱跳，象快活的老虎；这时脚下突然踩碎了一只酒杯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I trudged upstairs. My right hand clutched muffled Chum in my pocket, my left patted the sticky banisters. Of the three bedrooms I inspected, one had obviously been slept in that night. There was a library full of flowers. There was a rather bare room with ample and deep mirrors and a polar bear skin on the slippery floor. There were still other rooms. A happy thought struck me. If and when master returned from his constitutional in the woods, or emerged from some secret lair, it might be wise for an unsteady gunman with a long job before him to prevent his playmate from locking himself up in a room. Consequently, for at least five minutes I went about -- lucidly insane, crazily calm, an enchanted and very tight hunter -- turning whatever keys in whatever locks there were and pocketing them with my free left hand. The house, being an old one, had more planned privacy than have modern glamour-boxes, where the bathroom, the only lockable locus, has to be used for the furtive needs of planned parenthood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我举步上楼。右手抓住口袋里裹着的丘姆，左手扶着楼梯的扶手。我察看了三间卧室，其中一间显然是夜里有人住过。楼上一间藏书室，满是花。另一间空荡荡的屋子里，光滑的地板上立着许多宽大纵深的镜子，还有一张北极熊皮。还有许多房间。我忽然产生了一个很妙的想法。如果，或者当主人从林间散步回来，或从哪个秘密洞穴钻出来，对于一个面临重要任务而心神不定的持枪手来说，应该防止其游戏伙伴将自己锁在某间屋里。于是，至少有五分钟我满楼转悠——头脑清醒的神经错乱，发了疯的镇静，一个迷了心窍、顽固的猎人——哪只锁上有钥匙，就把它转下来，用空闲的左手揣进口袋。房子因为很古旧，没有现代迷宫，没有设计许多秘密机关，因此唯一能从里面反锁的浴室，是为了计划生育的秘密需要。">查看中文翻译</div>

All of a sudden I noticed that he had noticed that I did not seem to have noticed Chum protruding from beneath the other corner of the chest. We fell to wrestling again. We rolled all over the floor, in each other's arms, like two huge helpless children. He was naked and goatish under his robe, and I felt suffocated as he rolled over me. I rolled over him.

<div class="line_en">In its published form, this book is being read, I assume, in the first years of 2000 A. D. (1935 plus eighty or ninety, live long, my love); and elderly readers will surely recall at this point the obligatory scene in the Westerns of their childhood. Our tussle, however, lacked the ox-stunning fisticuffs, the flying furniture. He and I were two large dummies, stuffed with dirty cotton and rags. It was a silent, soft, formless tussle on the part of two literati, one of whom was utterly disorganized by a drug while the other was handicapped by a heart condition and too much gin. When at last I had possessed myself of my precious weapon, and the scenario writer had been reinstalled in his low chair, both of us were panting as the cowman and the sheepman never do after their battle.</div>

Friends are coming in the afternoon to take me to a game. This pistol-packing farce is becoming a frightful nuisance. We are men of the world, in everything -- sex, free verse, marksmanship. If you bear me a grudge, I am ready to make unusual amends. Even an old-fashioned rencontre, sword or pistol, in Rio or elsewhere -- is not excluded. My memory and my eloquence are not at their best today but really, my dear Mr. Humbert, you were not an ideal stepfather, and I did not force your little protégée to join me. It was she made me remove her to a happier home. This house is not as modern as that ranch we shared with dear friends. But it is roomy, cool in summer and winter, and in a word comfortable, so, since I intend retiring to England or Florence forever, I suggest you move in. It is yours, gratis. Under the condition you stop pointing at me that [he swore disgustingly] gun. By the way, I do not know if you care for the bizarre, but if you do, I can offer you, also gratis, as house pet, a rather exciting little freak, a young lady with three breasts, one a dandy, this is a rare and delightful marvel of nature. Now, soyons raisonnables. You will only wound me hideously and then rot in jail while I recuperate in a tropical setting. I promise you, Brewster, you will be happy here, with a magnificent cellar, and all the royalties from my next play -- I have not much at the bank right now but I propose to borrow -- you know, as the Bard said, with that cold in his head, to borrow and to borrow and to borrow. There are other advantages. We have here a most reliable and bribable charwoman, a Mrs. Vibrissa -- curious name -- who comes from the village twice a week, alas not today, she has daughters, granddaughters, a thing or two I know about the chief of police makes him my slave. I am a playwright. I have been called the American Maeterlinck. Maeterlinck-Schmetterling, says I. Come on! All this is very humiliating, and I am not sure I am doing the right thing. Never use herculanita with rum. Now drop that pistol like a good fellow. I knew your dear wife slightly. You may use my wardrobe. Oh, another thing -- you are going to like this. I have an absolutely unique collection of erotica upstairs. Just to mention one item: the in folio de-luxe Bagration Island by the explorer and psychoanalyst Melanie Weiss, a remarkable lady, a remarkable work -- drop that gun -- with photographs of eight hundred and something male organs she examined and measured in 1932 on Bagration, in the Barda Sea, very illuminating graphs, plotted with love under pleasant skies -- drop that gun -- and moreover I can arrange for you to attend executions, not everybody knows that the chair is painted yellow --"</div>

<div class="line_en">Feu. This time I hit something hard. I hit the back of a black rocking chair, not unlike Dolly Schiller's -- my bullet hit the inside surface of its back whereupon it immediately went into a rocking act, so fast and with such zest that any one coming into the room might have been flabbergasted by the double miracle: that chair rocking in a panic all by itself, and the armchair, where my purple target had just been, now void of all live content. Wiggling his fingers in the air, with a rapid heave of his rump, he flashed into the music room and the next second we were tugging and gasping on both sides of the door which had a key I had overlooked. I won again, and with another abrupt movement Clare the Impredictable sat down before the piano and played several atrociously vigorous, fundamentally hysterical, plangent chords, his jowls quivering, his spread hands tensely plunging, and his nostrils emitting the soundtrack snorts which had been absent from our fight. Still singing those impossible sonorities, he made a futile attempt to open with his foot a kind of seaman's chest near the piano. My next bullet caught him somewhere in the side, and he rose from his chair higher and higher, like old, gray, mad Nijinski, like Old Faithful, like some old nightmare of mine, to a phenomenal altitude, or so it seemed, as he rent the air -- still shaking with the rich black music -- head thrown back in a howl, hand pressed to his brow, and with his other hand clutching his armpit as if stung by a hornet, down he came on his heels and, again a normal robed man, scurried out into the hall.</div>

Ah, that hurts atrociously, my dear fellow. I pray you, desist. Ah -- very painful, very painful, indeed… God! Hah! This is abominable, you should really not --" His voice trailed off as he reached the landing, but he steadily walked on despite all the lead I had lodged in his bloated body -- and in distress, in dismay, I understood that far from killing him I was injecting spurts of energy into the poor fellow, as if the bullets had been capsules wherein a heady elixir danced.</div>

<div class="line_en">I found there a number of people who apparently had just arrived and were cheerfully drinking Quilty's liquor. There was a fat man in an easy chair; and two dark-haired pale young beauties, sisters no doubt, big one and small one (almost a child), demurely sat side by side on a davenport. A florid-faced fellow with sapphire-blue eyes was in the act of bringing two glasses out of the bar-like kitchen, where two or three women were chatting and chinking ice. I stopped in the doorway and said: "I have just killed Clare Quilty."</div>

Far from feeling any relief, a burden even weightier than the one I had hoped to get rid of was with me, upon me, over me. I could not bring myself to touch him in order to make sure he was really dead. He looked it: a quarter of his face gone, and two flies beside themselves with a dawning sense of unbelievable luck. My hands were hardly in better condition than his. I washed up as best I could in the adjacent bathroom. Now I could leave. As I emerged on the landing, I was amazed to discover that a vivacious buzz I had just been dismissing as a mere singing in my ears was really a medley of voices and radio music coming from the downstairs drawing room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一场悲剧持续一个多小时。他终于安静了。我根本没有如释重负之感，相反，一个甚至比我希望摆脱掉的那个重负更沉重的负担挨近了我，袭上了我的身，重重地压住了我。我不能过去碰他，证实他确已死了。看上去他是死了：四分之一个脸己被打掉，两只苍蝇团团围在边上旋转，开始意识到自己交了天大的好运。我的手不比他的手好多少。我到隔壁浴室里使劲搓洗。现在，我可以走了。当我重又出现在楼梯平台上时，我惊奇地发现一片轻松快活的聒噪果真是从楼下客厅里传来的嘈杂人声和收音机里的音乐声，而刚才我还以为是我的耳鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only the two girls on the davenport, both wearing black, the younger fingering a bright something about her white neck, only they said nothing, but just smiled on, so young, so lewd. As the music paused for a moment, there was a sudden noise on the stairs. Tony and I stepped out into the hall. Quilty of all people had managed to crawl out onto the landing, and there we could see him, flapping and heaving, and then subsiding, forever this time, in a purple heap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有那两个坐在长沙发上的女孩子，都穿着一身黑衣，年纪小的正拿手指拨弄着戴在雪白颈项上的一件亮闪闪的东西，只有她们什么都没说，只是微笑着，那么年轻，那么淫荡。音乐暂停了一会，突然，楼梯上响了一声。我和托尼大步走进大厅。正是奎尔蒂。他已经挣扎着移到了楼梯平台上，我们看见他站在那儿，摇摇晃晃，喘息不止，接着就缓缓地倒了下去，这一次是永远倒下去了，一堆紫红色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This, I said to myself, was the end of the ingenious play staged for me by Quilty. With a heavy heart I left the house and walked through the spotted blaze of the sun to my car. Two other cars were parked on both sides of it, and I had some trouble squeezing out.</div>
