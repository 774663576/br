<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a strange musician who was walking through the woods all by himself, thinking about this and that. When there was nothing left for him to think about, he said to himself, "It is boring here in the woods. I am going to get myself a good companion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前有一个技艺一流的乐师，他的小提琴演奏令人赏心悦耳，激动不已。他怀着愉快的心情到森林里去漫游，走了一段路，觉得一个人太无聊，就自言自语地说：“一个人太沉闷了，我得找一个伙伴来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="狐狸又按乐师的吩咐做了，他将这只爪子绑在了另一棵榛树的树梢，随后放开自己的脚，两边的榛树“哗啦”向上弹了起来，狐狸也跟着被弹起，四脚张开被挂了起来，来回在空中不停地摇晃着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now quickly, little hare, run twenty times around the tree," shouted the musician, and the little hare obeyed.

The more the hare tugged and pulled, the more the string cut into his tender neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，野兔，跳起来，迅速地绕树跑二十圈。”愚蠢的野兔按乐师的吩咐跑了起来。当兔子围着树跑完二十圈后，它也将系着它的绳子在树干上绕了二十圈，像一个被套在树上的囚犯。跑完后，野兔兴致勃勃地又拉又扯，但只要一拉，绳子将它的脖子勒得更紧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wolf, in the meantime, had pushed and pulled and bitten at the stone, and had worked so long that he freed his feet from the crack. Full of anger and rage he rushed after the musician, wanting to tear him to pieces.</div>

The sound reached the ears of a poor woodcutter, who instantly, whether he wanted to or not, stopped working and, with his ax under his arm, came toward the musician to listen to the music.</div>
