<div class="line_en">The winter of 1892 was darkened by the one cloud in my childhood's bright sky. Joy deserted my heart, and for a long, long time I lived in doubt, anxiety and fear. Books lost their charm for me, and even now the thought of those dreadful days chills my heart. A little story called "The Frost King," which I wrote and sent to Mr. Anagnos, of the Perkins Institution for the Blind, was at the root of the trouble. In order to make the matter clear, I must set forth the facts connected with this episode, which justice to my teacher and to myself compels me to relate.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wrote the story when I was at home, the autumn after I had learned to speak. We had stayed up at Fern Quarry later than usual. While we were there, Miss Sullivan had described to me the beauties of the late foliage, and it seems that her descriptions revived the memory of a story, which must have been read to me, and which I must have unconsciously retained. I thought then that I was "making up a story," as children say, and I eagerly sat down to write it before the ideas should slip from me. My thoughts flowed easily; I felt a sense of joy in the composition. Words and images came tripping to my finger ends, and as I thought out sentence after sentence, I wrote them on my braille slate. Now, if words and images come to me without effort, it is a pretty sure sign that they are not the offspring of my own mind, but stray waifs that I regretfully dismiss. At that time I eagerly absorbed everything I read without a thought of authorship, and even now I cannot be quite sure of the boundary line between my ideas and those I find in books. I suppose that is because so many of my impressions come to me through the medium of others' eyes and ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是在家中写下那个故事的，时间是在我学会说话之后的那年秋天。当时，我们住在弗恩采石场，睡觉的时间也比平时晚得多。苏立文小姐向我描述了深秋树叶的美丽多彩，她的讲述似乎唤醒了（我对）某个故事沉睡的记忆。这个故事一定被我读到过，我一定是在不知不觉间记住了这个故事。于是我想，我也要编写一个故事。说写就写，我任凭各种各样的思绪从头脑中汩汩涌出。我体会到了文思泉涌的快乐，我发现了创作过程的喜悦。富有生命的文字和想象轻快地游走在我的指端，我把一个又一个句子写在了我的盲文木板上。如今，假如词语和想象变得唾手可得，显然，这表明它们并非是出自我思想的产物，最多只是被我头脑遗弃的零星碎片。那时，我如饥似渴地汲取我读到的任何东西，从来就不会对著作本身有什么想法。即使是现在，我也无法完全在我的思想和我读到的那些书之间划清界限。我想，这是因为我过多地接受了别人的所见所闻，我只能依靠别人的眼睛“看”世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the story was finished, I read it to my teacher, and I recall now vividly the pleasure I felt in the more beautiful passages, and my annoyance at being interrupted to have the pronunciation of a word corrected. At dinner it was read to the assembled family, who were surprised that I could write so well. Some one asked me if I had read it in a book.</div>

<div class="line_en">Accordingly I copied the story and sent it to him for his birthday. It was suggested that I should change the title from "Autumn Leaves" to "The Frost King," which I did.

<div class="line_en">This question surprised me very much; for I had not the faintest recollection of having had it read to me. I spoke up and said, "Oh, no, it is my story, and I have written it for Mr. Anagnos."</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Anagnos was delighted with "The Frost King," and published it in one of the Perkins Institution reports. This was the pinnacle of my happiness, from which I was in a little while dashed to earth. I had been in Boston only a short time when it was discovered that a story similar to "The Frost King," called "The Frost Fairies" by Miss Margaret T. Canby, had appeared before I was born in a book called "Birdie and His Friends." The two stories were so much alike in thought and language that it was evident Miss Canby's story had been read to me, and that mine was -- a plagiarism. It was difficult to make me understand this; but when I did understand I was astonished and grieved. No child ever drank deeper of the cup of bitterness than I did. I had disgraced myself; I had brought suspicion upon those I loved best. And yet how could it possibly have happened? I racked my brain until I was weary to recall anything about the frost that I had read before I wrote "The Frost King"; but I could remember nothing, except the common reference to Jack Frost, and a poem for children, "The Freaks of the Frost," and I knew I had not used that in my composition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿纳戈诺斯先生很欣赏我的《冰雪之王》，他还把故事登在了帕金斯学院的一份刊物上。可以说，这把我推到了快乐的顶点，但是片刻之间，我就从云端直坠地面。我刚回到波士顿不久，就有人发现了一篇同《冰雪之王》类似的故事，那个故事名叫《冰雪仙子》，作者是玛格利特·T。肯拜小姐。这篇故事出自一本叫做《布莱迪和他的伙伴们》的书，而这本书早在我出生之前就出版了。无论在思路还是语言上，这两篇故事是如此相似，令人不得不相信我曾看到过肯拜小姐的书，这就是说，我的故事是一篇剽窃之作。起初我感到难以理解，但是搞明白后，我感到既震惊又伤心。没有一个孩子像我这样饮下了这么多的苦水。我感到颜面尽失。我令我最爱的那些人疑虑重重。可是，这一切怎么可能发生呢？我搜索枯肠左思右想，直到厌倦了回忆我读到过的任何有关森林的故事。事实上，在写《冰雪之王》之前，我不记得看到过这类故事。也许杰克·弗罗斯特为孩子们写的一首叫做《寒冬奇想》的诗和冰雪有关，可是我绝对没有在我的故事中使用到诗里的内容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The night before the celebration, one of the teachers of the Institution had asked me a question connected with "The Frost King," and I was telling her that Miss Sullivan had talked to me about Jack Frost and his wonderful works. Something I said made her think she detected in my words a confession that I did remember Miss Canby's story of "The Frost Fairies," and she laid her conclusions before Mr. Anagnos, although I had told her most emphatically that she was mistaken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="庆典活动的前一天晚上，学院里的一位老师问了我一个同《冰雪之王》有关的问题。我告诉她，苏立文小姐曾跟我介绍过杰克·弗罗斯特及其出色的诗作。我想我讲的某些事情让她产生了不切实际的想法，因为她从中觉察到了我对肯拜小姐的《冰雪仙子》记忆犹新，甚至认为我坦白交代了自己的过错。虽然我一再重申她的错误推断，但她还是把自己的结论提交给了阿纳戈诺斯先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Anagnos, who loved me tenderly, thinking that he had been deceived, turned a deaf ear to the pleadings of love and innocence. He believed, or at least suspected, that Miss Sullivan and I had deliberately stolen the bright thoughts of another and imposed them on him to win his admiration. I was brought before a court of investigation composed of the teachers and officers of the Institution, and Miss Sullivan was asked to leave me. Then I was questioned and cross-questioned with what seemed to me a determination on the part of my judges to force me to acknowledge that I remembered having had "The Frost Fairies" read to me. I felt in every question the doubt and suspicion that was in their minds, and I felt, too, that a loved friend was looking at me reproachfully, although I could not have put all this into words. The blood pressed about my thumping heart, and I could scarcely speak, except in monosyllables. Even the consciousness that it was only a dreadful mistake did not lessen my suffering, and when at last I was allowed to leave the room, I was dazed and did not notice my teacher's caresses, or the tender words of my friends, who said I was a brave little girl and they were proud of me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Sullivan had never heard of "The Frost Fairies" or of the book in which it was published. With the assistance of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, she investigated the matter carefully, and at last it came out that Mrs. Sophia C. Hopkins had a copy of Miss Canby's "Birdie and His Friends" in 1888, the year that we spent the summer with her at Brewster. Mrs. Hopkins was unable to find her copy; but she has told me that at that time, while Miss Sullivan was away on a vacation, she tried to amuse me by reading from various books, and although she could not remember reading "The Frost Fairies" any more than I, yet she felt sure that "Birdie and His Friends" was one of them. She explained the disappearance of the book by the fact that she had a short time before sold her house and disposed of many juvenile books, such as old schoolbooks and fairy tales, and that "Birdie and His Friends" was probably among them.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Miss Sullivan came back, I did not speak to her about "The Frost Fairies," probably because she began at once to read "Little Lord Fauntleroy," which filled my mind to the exclusion of everything else.

<div class="line_en">I have read "The Frost Fairies" since, also the letters I wrote in which I used other ideas of Miss Canby's. I find in one of them, a letter to Mr. Anagnos, dated September 29, 1891, words and sentiments exactly like those of the book. At the time I was writing "The Frost King," and this letter, like many others, contains phrases which show that my mind was saturated with the story. I represent my teacher as saying to me of the golden autumn leaves, "Yes, they are beautiful enough to comfort us for the flight of summer"-- an idea direct from Miss Canby's story.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Canby herself wrote kindly, "Some day you will write a great story out of your own head, that will be a comfort and help to many." But this kind prophecy has never been fulfilled. I have never played with words again for the mere pleasure of the game. Indeed, I have ever since been tortured by the fear that what I write is not my own. For a long time, when I wrote a letter, even to my mother, I was seized with a sudden feeling of terror, and I would spell the sentences over and over, to make sure that I had not read them in a book. Had it not been for the persistent encouragement of Miss Sullivan, I think I should have given up trying to write altogether.</div>

<div class="line_en">Those early compositions were mental gymnastics. I was learning, as all young and inexperienced persons learn, by assimilation and imitation, to put ideas into words. Everything I found in books that pleased me I retained in my memory, consciously or unconsciously, and adapted it. The young writer, as Stevenson has said, instinctively tries to copy whatever seems most admirable, and he shifts his admiration with astonishing versatility. It is only after years of this sort of practice that even great men have learned to marshal the legion of words which come thronging through every byway of the mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些作文构成了我早期的智力训练课程。像所有缺乏经验的年轻人一样，我通过吸收和模仿将自己的思想诉诸文字。书本中任何给我留下愉悦记忆的事物——无论是有意还是无意——都适用于这个原则。有一个年轻的作家史蒂文森曾说过，受本能驱使，他总是尽其所能地再现那些最令人景仰的崇高思想，而且，他会令人惊讶地将这种崇高转化为千变万化的文字效果。即使是伟大的人物，也只有经年累月地持续训练，才能汇聚起攻往每一条思想小径的文字大军。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This habit of assimilating what pleased me and giving it out again as my own appears in much of my early correspondence and my first attempts at writing. In a composition which I wrote about the old cities of Greece and Italy, I borrowed my glowing descriptions, with variations, from sources I have forgotten. I knew Mr. Anagnos's great love of antiquity and his enthusiastic appreciation of all beautiful sentiments about Italy and Greece. I therefore gathered from all the books I read every bit of poetry or of history that I thought would give him pleasure. Mr. Anagnos, in speaking of my composition on the cities, has said, "These ideas are poetic in their essence." But I do not understand how he ever thought a blind and deaf child of eleven could have invented them. Yet I cannot think that because I did not originate the ideas, my little composition is therefore quite devoid of interest. It shows me that I could express my appreciation of beautiful and poetic ideas in clear and animated language.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种深受周围事物同化的习性令我乐此不疲，我在早期通信和最初的写作中无不透露出同化因素的影响。我曾在自己的作文中写到了希腊和意大利的古老城市，我借用了多姿多彩的生动描述，但是我已经不记得它们的出处了。我知道阿纳戈诺斯先生对古代希腊和罗马的遗迹情有独钟，并且对它们所创造的古代文明推崇备至。于是，我便从我读过的所有书本中搜集出相关的诗歌和历史，我想这一定会令他很开心。阿纳戈诺斯先生则说我描写古代城市的作文“诗意地再现了其内在特质”。但我并不知晓他是如何看待一个十一岁的盲聋小孩的遣词造句的。总之，我并不认为我有创作的本事，因为我无法创造自己的观点，所以我的作文空泛而无趣也就在所难免了。这反倒提醒了我，我应该使用清晰而生动的语言来描述美好的事物，品评诗意的思想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am afraid I have not yet completed this process. It is certain that I cannot always distinguish my own thoughts from those I read, because what I read becomes the very substance and texture of my mind. Consequently, in nearly all that I write, I produce something which very much resembles the crazy patchwork I used to make when I first learned to sew. This patchwork was made of all sorts of odds and ends -- pretty bits of silk and velvet; but the coarse pieces that were not pleasant to touch always predominated. Likewise my compositions are made up of crude notions of my own, inlaid with the brighter thoughts and riper opinions of the authors I have read. It seems to me that the great difficulty of writing is to make the language of the educated mind express our confused ideas, half feelings, half thoughts, when we are little more than bundles of instinctive tendencies. Trying to write is very much like trying to put a Chinese puzzle together. We have a pattern in mind which we wish to work out in words; but the words will not fit the spaces, or, if they do, they will not match the design. But we keep on trying because we know that others have succeeded, and we are not willing to acknowledge defeat.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is no way to become original, except to be born so," says Stevenson, and although I may not be original, I hope sometime to outgrow my artificial, periwigged compositions. Then, perhaps, my own thoughts and experiences will come to the surface. Meanwhile I trust and hope and persevere, and try not to let the bitter memory of "The Frost King" trammel my efforts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽快创造出自己的替代品，虽然这些替代品只是头戴假发面具的矫饰文字。或许有朝一日，我自己的思想和人生经验也会尽显本色。在学习写作的过程中，我满怀信心，坚持不懈，并且尽量不让《冰雪之王》的苦涩记忆变成我学习之路上的阻碍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So this sad experience may have done me good and set me thinking on some of the problems of composition. My only regret is that it resulted in the loss of one of my dearest friends, Mr. Anagnos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我而言，这个惨痛的经历未尝不是一件好事，它让我对作文中所暴露的问题做出更加深入的思考。我唯一感到遗憾的是，我因此失去了最亲爱的朋友阿纳戈诺斯先生的友谊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since the publication of "The Story of My Life" in the Ladies' Home Journal, Mr. Anagnos has made a statement, in a letter to Mr. Macy, that at the time of the "Frost King" matter, he believed I was innocent. He says, the court of investigation before which I was brought consisted of eight people: four blind, four seeing persons. Four of them, he says, thought I knew that Miss Canby's story had been read to me, and the others did not hold this view. Mr. Anagnos states that he cast his vote with those who were favourable to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《我的生活》刊登在《女士之家》杂志以后，阿纳戈诺斯先生便发表了一项声明，他在给梅西先生的一封信中提到了《冰雪之王》事件。他相信我是无辜的，据他说，调查团由八名成员组成，包括四名盲人，四名正常人。其中的四人认为我读过肯拜小姐的故事，而另外四人则不支持这种观点。阿纳戈诺斯先生表示，作为调查团成员之一，他投了支持我的一票。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But, however the case may have been, with whichever side he may have cast his vote, when I went into the room where Mr. Anagnos had so often held me on his knee and, forgetting his many cares, had shared in my frolics, and found there persons who seemed to doubt me, I felt that there was something hostile and menacing in the very atmosphere, and subsequent events have borne out this impression. For two years he seems to have held the belief that Miss Sullivan and I were innocent. Then he evidently retracted his favourable judgment, why I do not know. Nor did I know the details of the investigation. I never knew even the names of the members of the "court" who did not speak to me. I was too excited to notice anything, too frightened to ask questions. Indeed, I could scarcely think what I was saying, or what was being said to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，无论这一事件的结果如何，也无论阿纳戈诺斯先生把自己的票投向哪一方，每当我走进他的办公室时，他总会把我抱在膝上嬉戏玩耍，从而忘掉种种烦恼。当时，他已经发觉到有人对我产生了怀疑，而我也感到周围弥漫着某种险恶的敌对气氛；其后发生的事件终于印证了这种不祥的预感。整整两年间，阿纳戈诺斯先生似乎一直相信我和苏立文小姐是清白无辜的。但是后来，他的立场发生了明显的偏转，我不知道这是为什么，也不知道具体的调查细节。我甚至连“陪审团”成员的名字都不知道，他们也不曾跟我说过话。当时，我心情激动，难以顾及其他事情；而且，我吓得惊恐万状，根本无法提出异议。事实上，我几乎想不起来我说过什么话，或者别人跟我说过什么话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have given this account of the "Frost King" affair because it was important in my life and education; and, in order that there might be no misunderstanding, I have set forth all the facts as they appear to me, without a thought of defending myself or of laying blame on any one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我所以把《冰雪之王》事件详加描述，是因为它在我接受教育的过程中意义非常。行为得当，也就不会引起误解发生。因此，一旦误解再度出现时，我会阐明事实，既不会巧言辩白，也不会怨天尤人。">查看中文翻译</div>
