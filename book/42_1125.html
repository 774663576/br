<div class="line_en">The water hole was now almost as large as the holes he had dug back at Camp Green Lake. It contained almost two feet of murky water. Stanley had dug it all himself. Zero had offered to help, but Stanley thought it better for Zero to save his strength. It was a lot harder to dig in water than it was in a dry lake.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley was surprised that he himself hadn't gotten sick -- either from the sploosh, the dirty water, or from living on onions. He used to get sick quite a lot back at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利很惊讶自己居然没病倒——无论是斯蒲露，脏水，还是每天仅靠洋葱保命。以前在家里，生病对他来说可是家常便饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I didn't go to the homeless shelter very often," Zero said. "Just if the weather was really bad. I'd have to find someone to pretend to be my mom. If I'd just gone by myself, they would have asked me a bunch of questions. If they'd found out I didn't have a mom, they would have made me a ward of the state."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不经常去流浪汉收容所。”零蛋说，“只是天气特别糟糕的时候才去。我必须找个人假装是我的妈妈。要是我自己一个人去，他们就会使劲地盘问我。要是他们发现我没有妈妈，就会把我交给政府监护。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They didn't dip their socks into the hole, afraid to contaminate the water. Instead they filled the jars and poured the water over their dirty socks.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我从没当过童子军。”斯坦利说，“我不太会做那样的社会活动。我太胖了，所以伙伴们总是取笑我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We always took what we needed," Zero said. "When I was little, I didn't even know it was stealing. I don't remember when I found out. But we just took what we needed, never more. So when I saw the shoes on display in the shelter, I just reached in the glass case and took them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们总是要什么就拿点什么。”零蛋说，“小时候，我甚至不知道这种行为就是偷窃。我也不记得自己究竟是什么时候明白这回事的。但我们只拿自己需要的东西，从不多拿。所以，在收容所的展览上看到那双鞋，我就把手伸进了玻璃柜。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I didn't know they were his. I just thought they were somebody's old shoes. It was better to take someone's old shoes, I thought, than steal a pair of new ones. I didn't know they were famous. There was a sign, but of course I couldn't read it. Then, the next thing I know everybody's making this big deal about how the shoes are missing. It was kind of funny, in a way. The whole place is going crazy. There I was, wearing the shoes, and everyone's running around saying, 'What happened to the shoes?' 'The shoes are gone!' I just walked out the door. No one noticed me. When I got outside, I ran around the corner and immediately took off the shoes. I put them on top of a parked car. I remember they smelled really bad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道鞋是他的。我还以为就是一双别人的旧鞋。我想偷旧鞋总比偷新鞋要好一些吧。我不知道那双鞋那么有名。上面有一个标签，但我不识字。接下来，所有人都在为那双鞋是怎么丢的打赌。这真有些可笑。整个收容所都发疯了。我就在那里，穿着那双鞋，看见每个人在我身边跑来跑去，嘴里还念叨着‘那双鞋出什么事了？’‘那双鞋不见了！’我乘机出了大门，没有人注意到我。出去后，我跑到街角，赶紧把鞋脱掉。我把它们放在旁边停着的一辆小轿车的车顶上。我还记得那双鞋非常臭。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I ended up getting arrested the next day when I tried to walk out of a shoe store with a new pair of sneakers. If I had just kept those old smelly sneakers, then neither of us would be here right now."</div>
