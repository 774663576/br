<div class="line_en">"It isn't anything very serious," Hurstwood said solemnly. He was very much disturbed over his own situation, and now that he had Carrie with him, he only wanted to get safely out of reach of the law. Therefore he was in no mood for anything save such words as would further his plans distinctly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious -- this going to a depot -- but said nothing. The whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day coaches. As the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were expected, there were only one or two brakemen waiting. They entered the rear day coach and sat down. Almost immediately, "All aboard," resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="站内停着一长列快车和客车，还有一两辆普通的硬席客车。因为这班火车是最近新开的，乘客不会多，所以只有一两个列车机务员等在那里。他们上了后面的一辆硬席客车。刚坐下，就听见外面隐约传来叫喊声：“乘客们，请上车！”接着，火车开动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very well," said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter. She was still nervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter. Hurstwood contemplated her and felt this. He was not disturbed that it should be so. He did not trouble because she was moved sympathetically in the matter. It was one of the qualities in her which pleased him exceedingly. He was only thinking how he should explain. Even this was not the most serious thing in his mind, however. His own deed and present flight were the great shadows which weighed upon him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”嘉莉说。她心里很乱，不知道对这件事情该采取什么样的态度才合适。她仍然急着想见到杜洛埃，看看他到底出了什么事。赫斯渥打量着她，感觉到了这一点。但是这并没有令他不安。他并不因为她在这件事上表现出的同情和激动而感到烦恼。这正是她的美德之一，他对此十分欣赏。他只是在考虑该怎么向她解释。然而，在他心中，甚至连这一点也还不是最严重的问题。他自己犯下的事和眼前的逃跑则是沉重地压在他心头的巨大阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In his sober senses, he could scarcely realise that the thing had been done. He could not begin to feel that he was a fugitive from justice. He had often read of such things, and had thought they must be terrible, but now that the thing was upon him, he only sat and looked into the past. The future was a thing which concerned the Canadian line. He wanted to reach that. As for the rest he surveyed his actions for the evening, and counted them parts of a great mistake.</div>

<div class="line_en">The train clacked through the yards along the lake front, and ran rather slowly to Twenty-fourth Street. Brakes and signals were visible without. The engine gave short calls with its whistle, and frequently the bell rang. Several brakemen came through, bearing lanterns. They were locking the vestibules and putting the cars in order for a long run.</div>

The speeding wheels and disappearing country put Chicago farther and farther behind.

She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would come to her aid; at other times it seemed an almost useless thing -- so far was she from any aid, no matter what she did.
