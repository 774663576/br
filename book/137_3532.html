<div class="line_en">At the epoch of this history, the cell in the Tour-Roland was occupied. If the reader desires to know by whom, he has only to lend an ear to the conversation of three worthy gossips, who, at the moment when we have directed his attention to the Rat-Hole, were directing their steps towards the same spot, coming up along the water's edge from the Châtelet, towards the Grève.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two of these women were dressed like good bourgeoises of Paris. Their fine white ruffs; their petticoats of linsey-woolsey, striped red and blue; their white knitted stockings, with clocks embroidered in colors, well drawn upon their legs; the square-toed shoes of tawny leather with black soles, and, above all, their headgear, that sort of tinsel horn, loaded down with ribbons and laces, which the women of Champagne still wear, in company with the grenadiers of the imperial guard of Russia, announced that they belonged to that class wives which holds the middle ground between what the lackeys call a woman and what they term a lady. They wore neither rings nor gold crosses, and it was easy to see that, in their ease, this did not proceed from poverty, but simply from fear of being fined. Their companion was attired in very much the same manner; but there was that indescribable something about her dress and bearing which suggested the wife of a provincial notary. One could see, by the way in which her girdle rose above her hips, that she had not been long in Paris.-- Add to this a plaited tucker, knots of ribbon on her shoes -- and that the stripes of her petticoat ran horizontally instead of vertically, and a thousand other enormities which shocked good taste.</div>

<div class="line_en">The child was making them drag him along, non passibus Cequis, as Virgil says, and stumbling at every moment, to the great indignation of his mother. It is true that he was looking at his cake more than at the pavement. Some serious motive, no doubt, prevented his biting it (the cake), for he contented himself with gazing tenderly at it. But the mother should have rather taken charge of the cake. It was cruel to make a Tantalus of the chubby-checked boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这孩子硬是要他妈妈拽着才走，non passibus œquis（24）——正如维吉尔所说。随时绊交，惹得他母亲大声呵斥。确实，他两眼直盯着手上的饼，并不看道儿。大概有个什么重大原因使他不去咬它（是说咬手上的饼），他只是以温情脉脉的目光盯着它看。其实，应该由妈妈来执掌这块粑粑的。把胖娃娃搞成了唐塔路斯（25）未免残忍。【注：（24）拉丁文，步伐并不坚定有力。（25）希腊神话中的一位国王，受众神惩罚，永受饥渴之苦，想吃的和想喝的都得不到。此处喻可望而不可即。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was at the Petit Bourbon," replied Gervaise, with no less spirit, "and this is what monsieur the cardinal's procurator presented to them: twelve double quarts of hippocras, white, claret, and red; twenty-four boxes of double Lyons marchpane, gilded; as many torches, worth two livres a piece; and six demi-queues of Beaune wine, white and claret, the best that could be found. I have it from my husband, who is a cinquantenier, at the Parloir-aux Bourgeois, and who was this morning comparing the Flemish ambassadors with those of Prester John and the Emperor of Trebizond, who came from Mesopotamia to Paris, under the last king, and who wore rings in their ears."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“确确实实是在小波旁宫，”惹维丝也驳道，尖刻不亚于她：“可不，红衣主教大人的状师赠送给他们：一打半升的甜酒，白的、紫红的、鲜红的；二十四盒蛋黄铺面的双层里昂杏仁蛋白糕；二十四支大蜡烛，每支两斤重；最好的半打博纳葡萄酒，白的、紫红的。我希望这些都是证明。我是听我男人说的，他是市民厅的五什长。今天早晨，他还把弗兰德尔御使同约翰教士和特瑞比宗德皇帝的御使比较了一番。这些使臣是先王在世的时候从美索不达米亚到巴黎来的，耳朵上都戴着耳环哩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Precisely. You will see her presently at her window on the Grève. She has the same opinion as yourself of these vagabonds of Egypt, who play the tambourine and tell fortunes to the public. No one knows whence comes her horror of the gypsies and Egyptians. But you, Mahiette -- why do you run so at the mere sight of them?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是。您马上就要从河滩上的窗洞里看见她了。对于那些打手鼓、给人算命的埃及流浪人，她的看法跟您一样。不知道怎么搞的，她那样厌恶茨冈人和埃及人。不过，您，马伊埃特，您干嘛一看见他们就没命地逃跑？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gladly," replied Mahiette, "but you must be ignorant of all but your Paris not to know that! I will tell you then (but 'tis not necessary for us to halt that I may tell you the tale), that Paquette la Chantefleurie was a pretty maid of eighteen when I was one myself, that is to say, eighteen years ago, and 'tis her own fault if she is not to-day, like me, a good, plump, fresh mother of six and thirty, with a husband and a son. However, after the age of fourteen, it was too late! Well, she was the daughter of Guybertant, minstrel of the barges at Reims, the same who had played before King Charles VII., at his coronation, when he descended our river Vesle from Sillery to Muison, when Madame the Maid of Orleans was also in the boat. The old father died when Paquette was still a mere child; she had then no one but her mother, the sister of M. Pradon, master-brazier and coppersmith in Paris, Rue Farm-Garlin, who died last year. You see she was of good family. The mother was a good simple woman, unfortunately, and she taught Paquette nothing but a bit of embroidery and toy-making which did not prevent the little one from growing very large and remaining very poor. They both dwelt at Reims, on the river front, Rue de Folle-Peine. Mark this: For I believe it was this which brought misfortune to Paquette. In '61, the year of the coronation of our King Louis XI. whom God preserve! Paquette was so gay and so pretty that she was called everywhere by no other name than "la Chantefleurie"-- blossoming song. Poor girl! She had handsome teeth, she was fond of laughing and displaying them. Now, a maid who loves to laugh is on the road to weeping; handsome teeth ruin handsome eyes. So she was la Chantefleurie. She and her mother earned a precarious living; they had been very destitute since the death of the minstrel; their embroidery did not bring them in more than six farthings a week, which does not amount to quite two eagle liards. Where were the days when Father Guybertant had earned twelve sous parisian, in a single coronation, with a song? One winter (it was in that same year of '61), when the two women had neither fagots nor firewood, it was very cold, which gave la Chantefleurie such a fine color that the men called her Paquette! and many called her Pàquerette! and she was ruined.-- Eustache, just let me see you bite that cake if you dare!-- We immediately perceived that she was ruined, one Sunday when she came to church with a gold cross about her neck. At fourteen years of age! do you see? First it was the young Vicomte de Cormontreuil, who has his bell tower three leagues distant from Reims; then Messire Henri de Triancourt, equerry to the King; then less than that, Chiart de Beaulion, sergeant-at-arms; then, still descending, Guery Aubergeon, carver to the King; then, Mace de Frépus, barber to monsieur the dauphin; then, Thévenin le Moine, King's cook; then, the men growing continually younger and less noble, she fell to Guillaume Racine, minstrel of the hurdy gurdy and to Thierry de Mer, lamplighter. Then, poor Chantefleurie, she belonged to every one: she had reached the last sou of her gold piece. What shall I say to you, my damoiselles? At the coronation, in the same year, '61, 'twas she who made the bed of the king of the debauchees! In the same year!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Patience!" resumed Mahiette, "you will see one child.-- In '66, 'twill be sixteen years ago this month, at Sainte-Paule's day, Paquette was brought to bed of a little girl. The unhappy creature! it was a great joy to her; she had long wished for a child. Her mother, good woman, who had never known what to do except to shut her eyes, her mother was dead. Paquette had no longer any one to love in the world or any one to love her. La Chantefleurie had been a poor creature during the five years since her fall. She was alone, alone in this life, fingers were pointed at her, she was hooted at in the streets, beaten by the sergeants, jeered at by the little boys in rags. And then, twenty had arrived: and twenty is an old age for amorous women. Folly began to bring her in no more than her trade of embroidery in former days; for every wrinkle that came, a crown fled; winter became hard to her once more, wood became rare again in her brazier, and bread in her cupboard. She could no longer work because, in becoming voluptuous, she had grown lazy; and she suffered much more because, in growing lazy, she had become voluptuous. At least, that is the way in which monsieur the cure of Saint-Remy explains why these women are colder and hungrier than other poor women, when they are old."</div>

<div class="line_en">"So she was very sad, very miserable, and furrowed her cheeks with tears. But in the midst of her shame, her folly, her debauchery, it seemed to her that she should be less wild, less shameful, less dissipated, if there were something or some one in the world whom she could love, and who could love her. It was necessary that it should be a child, because only a child could be sufficiently innocent for that. She had recognized this fact after having tried to love a thief, the only man who wanted her; but after a short time, she perceived that the thief despised her. Those women of love require either a lover or a child to fill their hearts. Otherwise, they are very unhappy. As she could not have a lover, she turned wholly towards a desire for a child, and as she had not ceased to be pious, she made her constant prayer to the good God for it. So the good God took pity on her, and gave her a little daughter. I will not speak to you of her joy; it was a fury of tears, and caresses, and kisses. She nursed her child herself, made swaddling-bands for it out of her coverlet, the only one which she had on her bed, and no longer felt either cold or hunger. She became beautiful once more, in consequence of it. An old maid makes a young mother. Gallantry claimed her once more; men came to see la Chantefleurie; she found customers again for her merchandise, and out of all these horrors she made baby clothes, caps and bibs, bodices with shoulder-straps of lace, and tiny bonnets of satin, without even thinking of buying herself another coverlet.-- Master Eustache, I have already told you not to eat that cake.-- It is certain that little Agnes, that was the child's name, a baptismal name, for it was a long time since la Chantefleurie had had any surname -- it is certain that that little one was more swathed in ribbons and embroideries than a dauphiness of Dauphiny! Among other things, she had a pair of little shoes, the like of which King Louis XI. certainly never had! Her mother had stitched and embroidered them herself; she had lavished on them all the delicacies of her art of embroideress, and all the embellishments of a robe for the good Virgin. They certainly were the two prettiest little pink shoes that could be seen. They were no longer than my thumb, and one had to see the child's little feet come out of them, in order to believe that they had been able to get into them. 'Tis true that those little feet were so small, so pretty, so rosy! rosier than the satin of the shoes! When you have children, Oudarde, you will find that there is nothing prettier than those little hands and feet."</div>

Her mother became more crazy over her every day. She kissed her, caressed her, tickled her, washed her, decked her out, devoured her! She lost her head over her, she thanked God for her. Her pretty, little rosy feet above all were an endless source of wonderment, they were a delirium of joy! She was always pressing her lips to them, and she could never recover from her amazement at their smallness. She put them into the tiny shoes, took them out, admired them, marvelled at them, looked at the light through them, was curious to see them try to walk on her bed, and would gladly have passed her life on her knees, putting on and taking off the shoes from those feet, as though they had been those of an Infant Jesus."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here," replied Mahiette. "One day there arrived in Reims a very queer sort of people. They were beggars and vagabonds who were roaming over the country, led by their duke and their counts. They were browned by exposure to the sun, they had closely curling hair, and silver rings in their ears. The women were still uglier than the men. They had blacker faces, which were always uncovered, a miserable frock on their bodies, an old cloth woven of cords bound upon their shoulder, and their hair hanging like the tail of a horse. The children who scrambled between their legs would have frightened as many monkeys. A band of excommunicates. All these persons came direct from lower Egypt to Reims through Poland. The Pope had confessed them, it was said, and had prescribed to them as penance to roam through the world for seven years, without sleeping in a bed; and so they were called penancers, and smelt horribly. It appears that they had formerly been Saracens, which was why they believed in Jupiter, and claimed ten livres of Tournay from all archbishops, bishops, and mitred abbots with croziers. A bull from the Pope empowered them to do that. They came to Reims to tell fortunes in the name of the King of Algiers, and the Emperor of Germany. You can readily imagine that no more was needed to cause the entrance to the town to be forbidden them. Then the whole band camped with good grace outside the gate of Braine, on that hill where stands a mill, beside the cavities of the ancient chalk pits. And everybody in Reims vied with his neighbor in going to see them. They looked at your hand, and told you marvellous prophecies; they were equal to predicting to Judas that he would become Pope. Nevertheless, ugly rumors were in circulation in regard to them; about children stolen, purses cut, and human flesh devoured. The wise people said to the foolish: 'Don't go there!' and then went themselves on the sly. It was an infatuation. The fact is, that they said things fit to astonish a cardinal. Mothers triumphed greatly over their little ones after the Egyptians had read in their hands all sorts of marvels written in pagan and in Turkish. One had an emperor; another, a pope; another, a captain. Poor Chantefleurie was seized with curiosity; she wished to know about herself, and whether her pretty little Agnes would not become some day Empress of Armenia, or something else. So she carried her to the Egyptians; and the Egyptian women fell to admiring the child, and to caressing it, and to kissing it with their black mouths, and to marvelling over its little band, alas! to the great joy of the mother. They were especially enthusiastic over her pretty feet and shoes. The child was not yet a year old. She already lisped a little, laughed at her mother like a little mad thing, was plump and quite round, and possessed a thousand charming little gestures of the angels of paradise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就来啦！”马伊埃特说，“有一天，兰斯来了一伙骑马的人，非常古怪。是乞丐、无赖汉，全国到处走，由他们的公爵、伯爵带领着。他们皮肤黝黑，头发打卷儿，耳朵上吊着银耳环。女的比男的还要丑。那些女人的脸更黑，从来不罩个什么；身上背着个小坏种；麻线织的旧粗布披肩系在肩头；头发扎成马尾巴。那些孩子手脚拳着，猴儿崽子见了都要害怕。这是一伙被天主教社会唾弃的人！他们都是直接从下埃及经过波兰到兰斯来的。听说教皇叫他们作了忏悔，要他们作为赎罪，在世上漂流七年，不许睡床（34）。因此，他们自称‘悔罪者’，身上发出臭味。看来，他们从前是萨腊赞人（35），所以他们信朱庇特，向所有佩戴十字架和法冠的大主教、主教和长老索取十图尔利弗。是教皇的一道训谕给他们这个权利的。他们到兰斯来，以阿尔及尔国王和德意志皇帝的名义给人算命。可以想见，单单这一点，就足以禁止他们进城。于是，他们整个一伙人都自愿搭起帐篷，驻扎在勃兰纳门附近，在一座今天尚存磨坊的土丘上，就在从前石灰窑附近。兰斯城里人人都抢着去看。他们给人看手相，算命说得灵极了。真是能把犹大说成将来要当教皇（36）。同时，也流传着可怕的谣言，说他们偷孩子，扒钱包，还吃人肉。聪明人对傻瓜说：‘别到那儿去！’他们自己却偷偷去。所以，都跟发了狂似的。事实上，他们说的事情，红衣主教听了都要吃惊。做母亲的听见他们看了自己孩子的手相，用异教语言和土耳其语说出许许多多奇迹般的事情，得意得不得了。这个的孩子将来要当皇帝，那个的要当教皇，还有一个要当统帅。可怜的香特弗勒里想知道自己的孩子将来怎么样，漂亮的小安妮丝会不会当上亚美尼亚的女皇或者什么的。她把小家伙抱到埃及人那里去；埃及女人夸奖孩子，抚摸她，用黑嘴唇亲她，看了她的手相惊异不置。可怜呀，母亲是多么高兴！她们特别赞美她美丽的脚、美丽的鞋。孩子这时还不满一岁。她已经牙牙学语，会对她妈妈憨笑，小傻瓜似的。胖乎乎，圆滚滚的，各种各样的小手势动作，和天堂的天使一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She was very much frightened by the Egyptians, and wept. But her mother kissed her more warmly and went away enchanted with the good fortune which the soothsayers had foretold for her Agnes. She was to be a beauty, virtuous, a queen. So she returned to her attic in the Rue Folle-Peine, very proud of bearing with her a queen. The next day she took advantage of a moment when the child was asleep on her bed, (for they always slept together), gently left the door a little way open, and ran to tell a neighbor in the Rue de la Séchesserie, that the day would come when her daughter Agnes would be served at table by the King of England and the Archduke of Ethiopia, and a hundred other marvels. On her return, hearing no cries on the staircase, she said to herself: 'Good! the child is still asleep!' She found her door wider open than she had left it, but she entered, poor mother, and ran to the bed.-The child was no longer there, the place was empty. Nothing remained of the child, but one of her pretty little shoes. She flew out of the room, dashed down the stairs, and began to beat her head against the wall, crying: 'My child! who has my child? Who has taken my child?' The street was deserted, the house isolated; no one could tell her anything about it. She went about the town, searched all the streets, ran hither and thither the whole day long, wild, beside herself, terrible, snuffing at doors and windows like a wild beast which has lost its young. She was breathless, dishevelled, frightful to see, and there was a fire in her eyes which dried her tears. She stopped the passers-by and cried: 'My daughter! my daughter! my pretty little daughter! If any one will give me back my daughter, I will be his servant, the servant of his dog, and he shall eat my heart if he will.' She met M. le Curé of Saint-Remy, and said to him: 'Monsieur, I will till the earth with my finger-nails, but give me back my child!' It was heartrending, Oudarde; and IL saw a very hard man, Master Ponce Lacabre, the procurator, weep. Ah! poor mother! In the evening she returned home. During her absence, a neighbor had seen two gypsies ascend up to it with a bundle in their arms, then descend again, after closing the door. After their departure, something like the cries of a child were heard in Paquette's room. The mother, burst into shrieks of laughter, ascended the stairs as though on wings, and entered.-- A frightful thing to tell, Oudarde! Instead of her pretty little Agnes, so rosy and so fresh, who was a gift of the good God, a sort of hideous little monster, lame, one-eyed, deformed, was crawling and squalling over the floor. She hid her eyes in horror. 'Oh!' said she, 'have the witches transformed my daughter into this horrible animal?' They hastened to carry away the little club-foot; he would have driven her mad. It was the monstrous child of some gypsy woman, who had given herself to the devil. He appeared to be about four years old, and talked a language which was no human tongue; there were words in it which were impossible. La Chantefleurie flung herself upon the little shoe, all that remained to her of all that she loved. She remained so long motionless over it, mute, and without breath, that they thought she was dead. Suddenly she trembled all over, covered her relic with furious kisses, and burst out sobbing as though her heart were broken. I assure you that we were all weeping also. She said: 'Oh, my little daughter! my pretty little daughter! where art thou?'-- and it wrung your very heart. I weep still when I think of it. Our children are the marrow of our bones, you see.-My poor Eustache! thou art so fair!-- If you only knew how nice he is! yesterday he said to me: 'I want to be a gendarme, that I do.' Oh! my Eustache! if I were to lose thee!-- All at once la Chantefleurie rose, and set out to run through Reims, screaming: 'To the gypsies' camp! to the gypsies' camp! Police, to burn the witches!' The gypsies were gone. It was pitch dark. They could not be followed. On the morrow, two leagues from Reims, on a heath between Gueux and Tilloy, the remains of a large fire were found, some ribbons which had belonged to Paquette's child, drops of blood, and the dung of a ram. The night just past had been a Saturday. There was no longer any doubt that the Egyptians had held their Sabbath on that heath, and that they had devoured the child in company with Beelzebub, as the practice is among the Mahometans. When La Chantefleurie learned these horrible things, she did not weep, she moved her lips as though to speak, but could not. On the morrow, her hair was gray. On the second day, she had disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她看见埃及女人，吓得直哭。可是，妈妈使劲吻她，听了算命女人关于安妮丝所说的话欣喜若狂，抱着她走了。她一定会出落得天仙似的，会是德性的化身，会当王后的。于是，母亲回到福耳—潘纳街的阁楼，感到抱回去的是一个王后，万分自豪。第二天，她趁孩子睡在她的床上（因为她一向让孩子跟她一起睡）的工夫，轻轻推开门，让门半掩着，跑到晒衣场街一个女邻人家里去告诉她：女儿安妮丝日后吃饭会有英国国王和埃塞俄比亚大公伺候，还有其他许许多多令人惊奇万分的事情。回家上楼的时候，没有听见孩子的叫声，她想：‘好，孩子还在睡！’她一看，门敞开着，出去原是关着的呀！她还是进去了，可怜的母亲！赶紧跑到床前……孩子不见了！床上是空的。孩子踪影不见，只留下漂亮小鞋的一只。她冲出房间，跳下楼梯，头往墙上使劲撞，叫道：‘我的孩子！在谁那儿呀？谁抱走了我的孩子？’街上渺无人影，她家的房子孤零零的。谁也不能告诉她什么。她在城里到处乱跑，大街小巷走遍，成天各处寻找，疯了似的，瞎窜，形容可怕，丢失了幼仔的野兽似的挨家挨户门窗上乱嗅。她气喘吁吁，披头散发，样子吓人，眼睛里冒火把眼泪也熬干了。她拦住行人，叫道：‘我的女儿！我的女儿！我的漂亮的小女儿！谁把我的女儿还我，我给他当奴婢，当他狗的奴婢，让他吃掉我的心肝五脏，如果他要的话！’她碰见圣勒米本堂神父，对他说：‘神父先生，我可以用手指头刨地，您得把女儿还给我！’……乌达德，真叫人揪心！有个心肠很硬的人，我看见连他都哭了，他就是状师蓬斯·拉卡勃尔，他说：‘可怜的母亲！’夜里，她回到家里。她不在家的时候，有个女街坊看见两个埃及女人抱着一个包裹，偷偷上楼去，然后关上门，又下楼来，匆匆跑掉了。她们走后，听见帕盖特房里好像有小孩的哭声。母亲笑逐颜开，长了翅膀似的飞上楼去，炮弹似的轰的一下冲开了门，进去……可怕极了呀，乌达德！不是她那可爱的小安妮丝，鲜艳红润，正是仁慈上帝的馈赠；而是一个小怪物，又丑，又跛，还瞎了一只眼，四肢扭曲着，嚎叫着，在石板地上瞎爬。她恶心得双手捂住眼睛。她说：‘啊！难道是巫婆把我的女儿变成了这样的一个可怕的怪物？’人们赶紧把这个小丑八怪抱开，免得她发疯。也不知道是哪个埃及女人给魔鬼生下的畸形孩子，大约四岁光景，说的是一种不是人的语言，只是一些根本听不清楚的单词。香特弗勒里向那只小鞋扑过去，她的所爱只剩下了这一点点东西。她呆立在那里，长久哑口无言，呼吸不得，简直就像死了。忽然，她浑身哆嗦起来，狂乱地吻着这圣物，放声痛哭，仿佛心都碎裂了。我敢说，换了我们也都会哭的。她喊道：‘啊！我的小女儿呀！我的漂亮的小女儿！你在哪儿？’听了真叫人心肝五脏都要碎了！我现在一想起来还要哭哩！你们说，我们的孩子不就是我们的心肝肉儿吗！……我可怜的欧斯塔希！他多好看！你们真不知道他有多可爱！昨天他对我说：‘我长大了要当近卫骑兵！’哦，我的欧斯塔希，要是丢掉了你，可怎么好呀！……香特弗勒里猛然站起来，在兰斯城里到处跑，喊叫：‘到埃及人营地去呀！到埃及人营地去！什长快来，烧死巫婆！’埃及人却已经走了。天也黑了。不可能去追他们。第二天，在兰斯两里开外，葛地和蒂洛瓦之间的一丛灌木里，找到了篝火的遗迹、帕盖特女儿的几根缎带、几点血迹和几粒羊屎。刚刚过去的一夜正是星期六夜晚：再也不可怀疑，埃及人在这丛灌木中举行了群魔会，按照回教徒的习俗（现在依然如此），同别西卜一起把孩子吃掉了。香特弗勒里听到这些可怕的情况之后，没有哭泣，嘴唇动了动，好像要说话，可是说不出。第二天，她的头发花白了。第三天，她不见了。”【注：（34）狄德罗主编的《百科全书》“波希米亚人”条目（狄德罗自己撰写）说：波希米亚人的来源可以追溯到1427年，“有十二个悔罪者自称下埃及的基督教徒，被萨腊赞人驱逐，来到了罗马，向教皇作了忏悔，教皇就叫他们为悔罪在世界上浪游七年，不许在任何床铺上睡觉。”雨果或许是据此而作这些断言的。（35）萨腊赞人，是中世纪对于中近东、北非和西班牙的穆斯林的称呼。这里也表明对于吉卜赛人起源问题的看法混乱。又，萨腊赞人并不信朱庇特。（36）犹大是出卖耶稣的人，当然是与基督教的教皇格格不入的。】">查看中文翻译</div>

A poor man found her gold cross hanging on the stone cross in the field where the fair is held. It was that ornament which had wrought her ruin, in '61. It was a gift from the handsome Vicomte de Cormontreuil, her first lover. Paquette had never been willing to part with it, wretched as she had been. She had clung to it as to life itself. So, when we saw that cross abandoned, we all thought that she was dead. Nevertheless, there were people of the Cabaret les Vantes, who said that they had seen her pass along the road to Paris, walking on the pebbles with her bare feet. But, in that case, she must have gone out through the Porte de Vesle, and all this does not agree.

In their absorption, they had passed the public breviary of the Tour-Roland without stopping, and took their way mechanically towards the pillory around which the throng was growing more dense with every moment.

<div class="line_en">The cell was small, broader than it was long, with an arched ceiling, and viewed from within, it bore a considerable resemblance to the interior of a huge bishop's mitre. On the bare flagstones which formed the floor, in one corner, a woman was sitting, or rather, crouching. Her chin rested on her knees, which her crossed arms pressed forcibly to her breast. Thus doubled up, clad in a brown sack, which enveloped her entirely in large folds, her long, gray hair pulled over in front, falling over her face and along her legs nearly to her feet, she presented, at the first glance, only a strange form outlined against the dark background of the cell, a sort of dusky triangle, which the ray of daylight falling through the opening, cut roughly into two shades, the one sombre, the other illuminated. It was one of those spectres, half light, half shadow, such as one beholds in dreams and in the extraordinary work of Goya, pale, motionless, sinister, crouching over a tomb, or leaning against the grating of a prison cell.</div>
