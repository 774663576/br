<div class="line_en">At first Park thought he was imagining it. He kept getting this feeling that she was looking at him, but whenever he looked over at her, her face was down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Today the girl was wearing a giant men's shirt with seashells all over it. The collar must have been really big, like disco-big, because she'd cut it, and it was fraying. She had a man's necktie wrapped around her ponytail like a big polyester ribbon. She looked ridiculous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天新女孩穿了巨大的男式衬衫，上面全是贝壳。原本的衣领一定非常大，大得像迪斯科年代的那种衬衫领，所以她把衣领剪掉了，露出破损的边缘。她的马尾上绑了一条男式领带，活像巨大的尼龙蝴蝶结。她看起来荒唐极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He finally realized that she was staring at his lap. Not in a gross way. She was looking at his comics -- he could see her eyes moving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克终于搞清楚了，她是在盯着他的大腿。不是色眯眯的那种，是在看他腿上的漫画——帕克能看到她眼珠的移动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That made it sound bad, but it wasn't. It might even be the best thing about her. It kind of reminded Park of the way artists draw Jean Grey sometimes when she's using her telepathy, with her eyes all blacked out and alien.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这听起来很恐怖，其实不然。或许还称得上她全身最棒的地方，让帕克想起画家笔下的琴·格雷（23）传送心灵感应时的模样，眼珠完全变黑，像外星人。【注：（23）琴·格雷（Jean Grey），漫画《X战警》里的凤凰女，又称传心女侠，拥有心灵及精神传动力。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park didn't know that anyone with red hair could have brown eyes. (He didn't know that anyone could have hair that red. Or skin that white.) The new girl's eyes were darker than his mom's, really dark, almost like holes in her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克从没见过红头发却有棕眼珠的人（他也没见过谁的头发那么红、皮肤那么白。）。这个新女孩眼珠颜色比他妈妈的还深，非常黑，像脸庞上的两个洞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Park felt like he should say something to her. He always felt like he should say something to her, even if it was just "hello" or "excuse me." But he'd gone too long without saying anything since the first time he'd cursed at her, and now it was all just irrevocably weird. For an hour a day. Thirty minutes on the way to school, thirty minutes back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克觉得应该跟她说话，随便说点什么，“你好”或者“对不起”都行。但是从第一次见面时对她爆粗到今天，已经时隔太久没有交谈，怪到极点，怪到无法逆转。每天他们要相处一小时啊。上学三十分钟车程，放学又三十分钟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the little kids stormed in after school, her mom lost her temper over something stupid -- Ben and Mouse fighting over a toy -- and she pushed them all out the back door, Eleanor included.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们下课后像一阵旋风似的冲进门后，妈妈因为班恩与鼠鼠抢玩具发火了，把他们通通从后门赶了出去，包括埃莉诺在内。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor was so startled to be outside that she stood on the back stoop for a second, staring down at Richie's Rottweiler. He'd named the dog Tonya after his ex-wife. She was supposed to be a real man-eater, Tonya -- Tonya the dog -- but Eleanor had never seen her more than half awake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺很惊讶自己也被赶出门，她在后门台阶站了一会儿，盯着雷奇养的那只罗威纳犬。雷奇给它取了前妻的名字“彤雅”，一个吞噬男人不眨眼的母老虎，但是埃莉诺每次看到这只彤雅，它都是半睡半醒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little kids were already out on the playground. The new house was right next door to an elementary school -- the school where Ben and Mouse and Maisie went -- and the playground was just beyond their backyard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们已经去操场玩了。他们的新家就在班恩、鼠鼠和梅西的小学旁，操场正对着他们家的后院。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor didn't know what else to do, so she walked out to where she could see Ben, by the swing set, and sat on one of the swings. It was finally jacket weather. Eleanor wished she had a jacket.</div>

<div class="line_en">"God. You too? Why do you guys call him that?" She tried not to sound angry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天啊，你也来这一套？为什么你们都叫他爸爸？”她尽量压抑着语气中的怒意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you supposed to do when it gets too cold to play outside?" she asked Ben. He was taking Matchbox cars out of his pockets and lining them up in the dirt. "Last year," he said, "Dad made us go to bed at 7:30."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她问班恩：“如果天气冷到不能出去玩，你们要怎么办？”班恩从口袋里拿出火柴盒玩具车，在泥地上排开。“去年，”他说，“爸爸让我们七点半就上床。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, but" -- Eleanor ran her hands up and down the swing chains, then smelled them -- "we never used to call him that. Do you feel like he's your dad?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，不过——”埃莉诺的手在秋千链上下滑动，然后闻闻双手的味道，“以前我们都不叫他爸爸。现在你又觉得他是爸爸了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't answer him, so he went back to setting up his cars. He needed a haircut, his strawberry-blond hair was curling almost to his collar. He was wearing an old T-shirt of Eleanor's and a pair of corduroy pants that their mom had cut off into shorts. He was almost too old for all this, for cars and parks -- eleven. The other boys his age played basketball all night or hung out in groups at the edge of the playground. Eleanor hoped that Ben was a late bloomer. There was no room in that house to be a teenager.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没回答，所以班恩继续玩玩具车。他该剪头发了，泛着金色的红卷发已经长到衣领。他身上是埃莉诺的T恤，灯芯绒短裤还是妈妈拿长裤裁的。他已经十一岁了，不再适合在公园玩模型车了。同年纪的男孩晚上都在打篮球，或者成群结队在操场边晃。埃莉诺希望班恩是那种心智开窍晚的，这个家可容不下青春期孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He likes it when we call him Dad," Ben said, still lining up the cars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="班恩说：“他喜欢我们叫他爸爸。”他仍在排模型车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It'll be like a slumber party," Mrs Hickman said to Eleanor the first night she made up the couch. Mrs Hickman -- Tammy -- knew Eleanor's mom from high school. There was a photo over the TV of the Hickmans' wedding. Eleanor's mom was the maid of honor -- in a dark green dress, with a white flower in her hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一天晚上，希克曼太太帮她在客厅沙发铺床时说：“这就像睡衣派对一样。”希克曼太太——塔米，是妈妈的高中同学。他们家的电视上放了一张婚礼照片，埃莉诺的妈妈是伴娘，穿着深绿色的洋装，头上插了朵白花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first, her mom would call Eleanor at the Hickmans' almost every day after school. After a few months, the calls stopped. It turned out that Richie hadn't paid the phone bill, and it got disconnected. But Eleanor didn't know that for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始，妈妈几乎每天都在她放学后打电话来。几个月后，电话停了。原来雷奇没付电话费，被停机了。过了好一阵子埃莉诺才知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor tried to be even less trouble. She practiced being in a room without leaving any clues that she'd been there. She never turned on the TV or asked to use the phone. She never asked for seconds at dinner. She never asked Tammy and Mr Hickman for anything -- and they'd never had a teenager, so it didn't occur to them that there might be anything she might need. She was glad that they didn't know her birthday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺尽量不骚扰他们，努力不在待过的房间留下痕迹。她不擅自开电视或者用电话，吃晚饭时绝不再加饭。她绝不开口向希克曼夫妇要任何东西。他们也没有青春期的孩子，不知道这个年纪的孩子可能会需要点什么。她很高兴希克曼夫妇不知道她的生日…">查看中文翻译</div>
