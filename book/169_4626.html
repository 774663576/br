<div class="line_en">Jaime was sorely tempted to crack him across the mouth with his golden hand. A few missing teeth would put an end to his smiles. For a man who was going to spend the rest of his life a prisoner, Edmure was entirely too pleased with himself.

Would you care to reconsider that answer?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He went to the window and gazed out over the river. It was a bright autumn day, and the sun was shining on the waters. By now the Blackfish could be ten leagues downstream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走到窗前，望向外面的河流。这是个明媚的秋日，阳光在水面闪耀。黑鱼多半游出十里格远了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he slipped under our boom the same way, no doubt. A moonless night, bored guards, a black fish in a black river floating quietly downstream. If Ruttiger or Yew or any of their men heard a splash, they would put it down to a turtle or a trout. Edmure had waited most of the day before hauling down the direwolf of Stark in token of surrender. In the confusion of the castle changing hands, it had been the next morning before Jaime had been informed that the Blackfish was not amongst the prisoners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他用同样的方式通过了我们的拦江堤坝。无月之夜，厌倦的守卫，一条黑鱼顺着黑色的河流静静地游向下游。宇或鲁特格尔或他们的部下最多听到一点水声，只当乌龟或鳟鱼做怪。艾德慕是存心的，他无端磨蹭了大半天，才降下史塔克的冰原狼旗，表示降服。结果在城堡易主的混乱中，直到第二天清晨詹姆才得报说黑鱼失踪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He did swim," said Edmure, sullenly. He had the same blue eyes as his sister Catelyn, and Jaime saw the same loathing there that he'd once seen in hers. "We raised the portcullis on the Water Gate. Not all the way, just three feet or so. Enough to leave a gap under the water, though the gate still appeared to be closed. My uncle is a strong swimmer. After dark, he pulled himself beneath the spikes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他真是游出去的，”艾德慕郁闷地坦白。他有他姐姐凯特琳的蓝眼睛，而詹姆在这双眼睛里也瞧见了当初他姐姐瞧詹姆时的嫌恶。“我们打开水门的铁闸，没有全开，只升起三尺左右，在水底留下缝隙，表面看来却没变化。我叔叔是个游泳健将，天黑之后，他只身钻过水底的尖刺。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He'll be found." Jaime spoke with a certainty he did not feel. "I have hounds and hunters sniffing after him even now." Ser Addam Marbrand was leading the search on the south side of the river, Ser Dermot of the Rainwood on the north. He had considered enlisting the riverlords as well, but Vance and Piper and their ilk were more like to help the Blackfish escape than clap him into fetters. All in all, he was not hopeful. "He may elude us for a time," he said, "but eventually he must surface."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他跑不掉，”詹姆嘴上这么讲，心里却没那么肯定，“我已派猎人和猎狗去找。”南岸的搜索由亚当·马尔布兰爵士负责，北岸由雨林的德莫特爵士。他本想让本地的三河诸侯参加，但凡斯、派柏这类人大概只会帮倒忙，协助黑鱼逃亡吧。总而言之，詹姆不抱太大希望。“他躲得了一时，”铁卫队长最后说，“躲不了一世。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have to find him," insisted Emmon Frey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“必须抓住他。”艾蒙·佛雷坚持。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“万一他回来抢我的城堡怎么办？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have a garrison of two hundred." Too large a garrison, in truth, but Lord Emmon had an anxious disposition. At least he would have no trouble feeding them; the Blackfish had left Riverrun amply provisioned, just as he had claimed. "After the trouble Ser Brynden took to leave us, I doubt that he'll come skulking back." Unless it is at the head of a band of outlaws. He did not doubt that the Blackfish meant to continue the fight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你有两百卫兵呢。”就守卫城堡而言，两百人太多，但艾蒙老爷的统治危机四伏。幸亏他无须担忧如何供养这批人，黑鱼正如其宣称的那样，在奔流城内储备了充足补给。“布林登爵士给我们造成那么大麻烦，我怀疑他还会不会回来自投罗网。”但他有可能落草后带一大票土匪回来。黑鱼的战斗精神不容置疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Emmon rubbed his mouth. His hand came away red and slimy from the sourleaf. "To be sure. Riverrun is mine, and no man shall ever take it from me." He gave Edmure Tully one last suspicious look, as Lady Genna drew him from the solar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾蒙老爷揉揉嘴巴，他的手因酸草叶的关系又红又黏糊糊的。“那当然，那当然。奔流城是我的，没人能从我手中把它夺去。”他给了艾德慕最后一个怀疑的眼神，随后被吉娜夫人从书房里拉走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This was my father's solar," said Tully. "He ruled the riverlands from here, wisely and well. He liked to sit beside that window. The light was good there, and whenever he looked up from his work he could see the river. When his eyes were tired he would have Cat read to him. Littlefinger and I built a castle out of wooden blocks once, there beside the door. You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room, Kingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我父亲的书房，”徒利骄傲地说，“他坐在这里统治三河流域，睿智而威严。他喜欢在窗前办公，因为那儿光线最好，只需稍微抬头，河上风景便一览无余。后来，他眼睛坏了，便叫凯特琳来念文件。小指头和我曾在门边用木块搭了一座城堡。弑君者，你永远也想象不出我看到你待在这间屋子里心中有多么厌恶，你永远也想象不到我有多鄙视你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not look dangerous. Jeyne was a willowy girl, no more than fifteen or sixteen, more awkward than graceful. She had narrow hips, breasts the size of apples, a mop of chestnut curls, and the soft brown eyes of a doe. Pretty enough for a child, Jaime decided, but not a girl to lose a kingdom for. Her face was puffy, and there was a scab on her forehead, half-hidden by a lock of brown hair. "What happened there?" he asked her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看起来并不危险。简妮身材苗条，十五六岁，动作有些笨拙，谈不上优雅。她臀部普通，乳房有苹果大小，一头栗色鬈发，温柔的棕色眼睛让人联想起母鹿。以孩子的标准而言长得挺俊俏，詹姆断定，但绝对不值得赔上一整个王国。她的脸肿起来，前额有道擦伤，半掩在一髻棕色发卷后面。“怎么回事？”他问她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jaime shoved the map aside. "Show them in." At least the girl did not vanish too. Jeyne Westerling had been Robb Stark's queen, the girl who cost him everything. With a wolf in her belly, she could have proved more dangerous than the Blackfish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆推开地图，“有请。”至少这女孩没有失踪。简妮·维斯特林是罗柏·史塔克的王后，正是她导致他亡国灭身。若她肚子里怀有小狼崽的话，便比黑鱼危险一万倍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jaime nodded. Tywin Lannister was not a man to overlook such details. "Unhand the girl," he said, "I'm done with her for now." As Jeyne fled sobbing down the stairs, he considered her mother. "House Westerling has its pardon, and your brother Rolph has been made Lord of Castamere. What else would you have of us?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆点点头。泰温·兰尼斯特是不会忽略这样的细节的。“放开她，”他命令，“我想问她的问完了。”简妮飞奔下楼。他又转回面对她母亲，“国王赦免了维斯特林家族，你哥哥罗佛·斯派瑟爵士被提升为卡斯特梅伯爵。你还有什么要求？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your lord father promised me worthy marriages for Jeyne and her younger sister. Lords or heirs, he swore to me, not younger sons nor household knights."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你父亲大人曾答应我要为简妮和她妹妹各找一户好人家。要么是领主，要么是领主的继承人，他信上白纸黑字地写着，决不会拿次子幼子或附庸骑士来搪塞。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lords or heirs. To be sure. The Westerlings were an old House, and proud, but Lady Sybell herself had been born a Spicer, from a line of upjumped merchants. Her grandmother had been some sort of half-mad witch woman from the east, he seemed to recall. And the Westerlings were impoverished. Younger sons would have been the best that Sybell Spicer's daughters could have hoped for in the ordinary course of events, but a nice fat pot of Lannister gold would make even a dead rebel's widow look attractive to some lord. "You'll have your marriages," said Jaime, "but Jeyne must wait two full years before she weds again." If the girl took another husband too soon and had a child by him, inevitably there would come whispers that the Young Wolf was the father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，父亲会拿领主或领主的继承人作诱饵。维斯特林家族虽然历史悠久，又极骄傲，但希蓓儿夫人本姓斯派瑟，祖上是做生意的暴发户，据传她祖母更是疯疯癫癫的东方巫婆。此外，维斯特林家目前穷困潦倒，正常情况下，希蓓儿·斯派瑟的女儿最多找个领主的次子嫁出去，好在钱能通神，兰尼斯特的金子会让叛贼的寡妇具有跟高贵的处女同样的吸引力。“你会得到婚约，”詹姆道，“但首先让简妮等上两年。”如果结婚太快，又产下子嗣，人们便会议论纷纷，宣扬少狼主才是孩子真正的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No more than I want Joy to marry the son of some scheming turncloak bitch. She deserves better." Jaime would happily have strangled the woman with her seashell necklace. Joy was a sweet child, albeit a lonely one; her father had been Jaime's favorite uncle. "Your daughter is worth ten of you, my lady. You'll leave with Edmure and Ser Forley on the morrow. Until then, you would do well to stay out of my sight." He shouted for a guardsman, and Lady Sybell went off with her lips pressed primly together. Jaime had to wonder how much Lord Gawen knew about his wife's scheming. How much do we men ever know?</div>

<div class="line_en">When Edmure and the Westerlings departed, four hundred men rode with them; Jaime had doubled the escort again at the last moment. He rode with them a few miles, to talk with Ser Forley Prester. Though he bore a bull's head upon his surcoat and horns upon his helm, Ser Forley could not have been less bovine. He was a short, spare, hard-bitten man. With his pinched nose, bald pate, and grizzled brown beard, he looked more like an innkeep than a knight. "We don't know where the Blackfish is," Jaime reminded him, "but if he can cut Edmure free, he will."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾德慕和维斯特林们起程时，卫兵增加到四百——詹姆在最后时刻将卫兵再翻了一番。他随队伍骑出几里路，仔细嘱咐佛勒·普莱斯特爵士。此人外套上有公牛头纹章，头盔上有两只牛角，本人却毫无牛的架势。他矮小、消瘦、性格坚韧，夹紧的鼻孔、光秃的头顶和灰褐色胡须令他看起来更像旅馆老板而不像骑士。“我们不清楚黑鱼的去向，”詹姆一再提醒对方，“但他肯定会想尽办法释放艾德慕。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That will not happen, my lord." Like most innkeeps, Ser Forley was no man's fool. "Scouts and outriders will screen our march, and we'll fortify our camps by night.

<div class="line_en">Jaime had to canter past the Westerlings as he rode down the column on his way back to Riverrun. Lord Gawen nodded gravely as he passed, but Lady Sybell looked through him with eyes like chips of ice. Jeyne never saw him at all. The widow rode with downcast eyes, huddled beneath a hooded cloak. Underneath its heavy folds, her clothes were finely made, but torn. She ripped them herself, as a mark of mourning, Jaime realized. That could not have pleased her mother. He found himself wondering if Cersei would tear her gown if she should ever hear that he was dead.</div>

So long as it is Jonos at his gates Tytos will never yield, but I know he will bend his knee for you." Jaime thanked him for his counsel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ask Edmure how chivalrous I am, thought Jaime. Ask him about the trebuchet. Somehow he did not think the maesters were like to confuse him with Prince Aemon the Dragonknight when they wrote their histories. Still, he felt curiously content. The war was all but won. Dragonstone had fallen and Storm's End would soon enough, he could not doubt, and Stannis was welcome to the Wall. The northmen would love him no more than the storm lords had. If Roose Bolton did not destroy him, winter would. And he had done his own part here at Riverrun without actually ever taking up arms against the Starks or Tullys. Once he found the Blackfish, he would be free to return to King's Landing, where he belonged. My place is with my king. With my son. Would Tommen want to know that? The truth could cost the boy his throne. Would you sooner have a father or a chair, lad? Jaime wished he knew the answer. He does like stamping papers with his seal. The boy might not even believe him, to be sure. Cersei would say it was a lie. My sweet sister, the deceiver. He would need to find some way to winkle Tommen from her clutches before the boy became another Joffrey. And whilst at that, he should find the lad a new small council too. If Cersei can be put aside, Ser Kevan may agree to serve as Tommen's Hand. And if not, well, the Seven Kingdoms did not lack for able men. Forley Prester would make a good choice, or Roland Crakehall. If someone other than a westerman was needed to appease the Tyrells, there was always Mathis Rowan… or even Petyr Baelish. Littlefinger was as amiable as he was clever, but too lowborn to threaten any of the great lords, with no swords of his own. The perfect Hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你去问问艾德慕我高不高尚，詹姆心想，去问他投石机的事。他很确定，未来的学士是决不会把他跟龙骑士伊蒙王子写在一起的。他原本也不在乎。战争总算胜利告终。龙石岛陷落，风息堡指日可待，史坦尼斯要逃往长城的话，欢迎他去。可以想见，北方佬跟风暴之地的领主一样不喜欢他，而即便卢斯·波顿失败了，冬天也会把他彻底摧毁。欣慰的是，他在奔流城下没流一滴血，也没拿起武器反对史塔克家族或徒利家族。只等找到黑鱼，就算大功告成，可以返回君临。我应该待在国王身边，待在我儿子身边。托曼了解我的心情吗？真相会导致他丢失王位。你想要父亲还是那把丑椅子，孩子？詹姆希望自己知道答案。迄今为止，这孩子最喜欢的是在纸上盖印章。他甚至不会相信我的话。至少瑟曦会坚决否认。我亲爱的老姐，骗子，大骗子。他必须想个办法把托曼夺过来，赶在瑟曦将他变成第二个乔佛里之前，到时候，他还要组建一个崭新的御前会议来辅佐孩子。瑟曦让位，凯冯爵士应会同意担任首相。他不愿吃回头草也没什么，七国有的是人才。佛勒·普莱斯特就是不错的选择，或者罗兰德·克雷赫，如果提利尔家不满意西境人，他也可以推举马图斯·罗宛…甚至培提尔·贝里席。是的，小指头虽然机灵圆滑，但出身太低，没有自己的武装，大诸侯们不会拿他当威胁。他是完美的首相人选。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jaime still had the garrison to deal with. To a man, they swore that they knew nothing of Ser Brynden's plans or where he might have gone. "They are lying," Emmon Frey insisted, but Jaime thought not. "If you share your plans with no one, no one can betray you," he pointed out. Lady Genna suggested that a few of the men might be put to the question. He refused. "I gave Edmure my word that if he yielded, the garrison could leave unharmed."</div>
