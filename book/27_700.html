<div class="line_en">The rental house Tyler Shultz shared with five roommates in Los Altos Hills was only a twenty-five-minute drive from his parents' home in Los Gatos, so he tried to have dinner with them about once every other week. Early on the evening of May 27, 2015, Tyler eased his little Toyota Prius C into his parents' garage and entered the house through the kitchen. When he caught sight of his father, he immediately sensed that something was wrong. His face was a mask of worry and panic.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler called his grandfather back and asked if the two of them could get together later that night without any lawyers. George said he and Charlotte were out to dinner but should be home by nine and Tyler could come by then. Tyler sat down for a quick meal with his parents, then headed home to think through how he would approach the conversation with his grandfather. His mother and father gave him big hugs as he headed out the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he got home, Tyler called me. From the tone of his voice he seemed a nervous wreck. He asked whether I had disclosed our communications to Theranos. Absolutely not, I replied, telling him I took the promises of confidentiality I made to sources very seriously. We tried to figure out what had happened.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been three weeks since we had met at the beer garden in Mountain View. Back in New York, Matthew Traub had continued putting off my requests for an interview with Holmes and had asked me to send him questions instead.

<div class="line_en">I forwarded the email to Tyler and he scanned it while we were on the phone. In one section about assay validation, I had included a coefficient of variation for one of the Edison blood tests, not realizing that it was a figure Tyler had calculated himself. There was nothing else in the email that could point to him, so Tyler assumed that was what they had seized on. He seemed to relax. He could easily explain that number away, he said. It could have come from anyone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without admitting anything, Tyler tried once more to convince his grandfather that Theranos was misleading him. He went over again all the things he had told him a year earlier, including the fact that the company performed only a small fraction of its blood tests on its proprietary Edison devices. George remained unconvinced. He told Tyler that Theranos had prepared a one-page document for him to sign affirming that he would abide by his confidentiality obligations going forward. The Wall Street Journal was going to publish Theranos trade secrets and those trade secrets would become public domain if the company didn't show it had taken action to protect them, he explained. Tyler didn't see why he had to do that but said he'd be willing to consider it if it meant the company would stop bothering him.</div>

<div class="line_en">George came to his grandson's help. "I know this kid, and this kid doesn't lie. If he says he didn't speak to the reporter, then he didn't speak to the reporter!" he exclaimed. The former secretary of state ushered the two lawyers out of the house. When they were gone, he called Holmes and told her this was not what they had agreed upon.

<div class="line_en">Brille said he knew he was lying and pressed him to admit it, but Tyler stood firm. The lawyer refused to let it rest. He was like an attack dog.

<div class="line_en">George got back on the line and a compromise was reached: they would meet again at the house the following morning and Theranos would bring the one-page document they had originally discussed affirming that Tyler would honor his confidentiality obligations.

<div class="line_en">George grabbed a pencil and scrawled a line on the affidavit to the effect that Theranos pledged not to sue Tyler Shultz for two years. Tyler wondered for a split second if his grandfather thought he was an idiot.</div>

After conferring with the two lawyers, Tyler decided not to sign the document.

<div class="line_en">When Anders informed Mike Brille that Tyler would not be signing the affidavit, Brille warned that Theranos would have no choice but to sue him. Tyler went home expecting to be summoned to court the next day, but late that evening, Brille sent Anders an email saying Theranos had decided to hold off on a lawsuit to give the two sides more time to work something out. Tyler breathed a sigh of relief when he got the news.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anders referred Tyler to a lawyer named Stephen Taylor, who headed a boutique law firm in San Francisco experienced in handling complex business disputes. During the following weeks, Brille and Taylor exchanged four different drafts of the affidavit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安德斯把泰勒转介给一位名叫史蒂芬．铁乐（Stephen Taylor）的律师，他是旧金山一家精品型的小事务所负责人，专门经手复杂的商业纠纷。接下来几个星期，布里耶和铁乐交换了四个不同版本的切结书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyler tried to be conciliatory in an effort to reach an agreement, acknowledging in the new versions of the document that he had talked to the Journal. Theranos gave him the option of saying that he was young and naïve and that the reporter had deceived him, but he declined. He had known exactly what he was doing and youth had nothing to do with it. He hoped he would have acted the exact same way if he had been forty or fifty. To placate Theranos, Tyler did consent to being portrayed as a junior employee whose duties were so menial that he couldn't possibly have known what he was talking about when it came to topics like proficiency testing, assay validation, and lab operations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒发布愿意和解的消息，努力想达成协议，他在新版本的切结书中承认接触过《华尔街日报》，Theranos要他坦承自己年轻无知，还要他说是因记者蓄意欺骗才使他误信。但他拒绝，他很清楚自己在做什么，跟年纪轻一点关系也没有，他希望自己到四、五十岁仍会采取跟现在一样的作为。不过为了使Theranos息怒，泰勒倒是同意被描绘成职责微不足道的资浅员工，不可能知道他所说的那些能力测试、测定确效、实验室运作等。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the negotiations stalled over two issues. Theranos still wanted Tyler to name the Journal's other sources, which Tyler steadfastly refused to do. And the company declined to include his parents and heirs in the litigation release it was willing to grant him. As the stalemate dragged on, Boies Schiller resorted to the bare-knuckle tactics it had become notorious for. Brille let it be known that if Tyler didn't sign the affidavit and name the Journal's sources, the firm would make sure to bankrupt his entire family when it took him to court. Tyler also received a tip that he was being surveilled by private investigators. His lawyer tried to make light of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这场谈判卡在两个问题上。一是Theranos仍旧要求泰勒交出其他线人的名字，这一点他坚决不从；二是Theranos愿意给他诉讼豁免，但拒绝纳入他的父母和子嗣。僵局迟迟未解的情况下，BSF事务所转而动用它向来恶名昭彰的激进蛮横手段。布里耶放话，要是泰勒不签切结书并交出线人的名字，BSF保证把他告上法庭，一定会搞到他全家破产。此外，泰勒也接获情报，有私家侦探在监视他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To allow Tyler to update his parents about where things stood, Taylor arranged for them to have their own legal counsel. That way he could communicate with them through attorneys and those conversations would be protected by attorney-client privilege. This led to an incident that rattled both Tyler and his parents. Hours after his parents' new lawyer met with them for the first time, her car was broken into and a briefcase containing her notes from the meeting was stolen. Although it could have been a random act of theft, Tyler couldn't shake his suspicion that Theranos had something to do with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了让泰勒能跟父母讲述事情最新发展，铁乐律师替他父母安排了律师，泰勒就可以透过律师传话给父母，而谈话内容又可以受到「律师与委托人守密特权」（attorney-client privilege）的保护。不过，这个做法引来一件插曲令泰勒和父母都很惊惶不安。新律师跟他的父母第一次碰完面，几小时后律师的车子遭人强行进入，装有那次碰面纪录的公事包被偷。虽然可能只是一起随机偷窃，泰勒还是无法不怀疑跟Theranos有关。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening, Tyler's parents received a call from his grandfather. George said Holmes had told him that Tyler was responsible for most of the information the Journal had and was being completely unreasonable. Tyler's parents sat him down in their kitchen and pleaded with him to sign whatever Theranos wanted him to sign at the next opportunity. Otherwise, they would have to sell their house to pay for his legal costs. It wasn't that simple, Tyler replied, unable to say much more. He badly wanted to explain to them what was going on, but he was under instructions not to discuss the negotiations with Theranos with anyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天晚上，泰勒的爸妈接到他爷爷来电。乔治说霍姆斯告诉他，《华尔街日报》所知的消息大多是泰勒提供的，还说泰勒现在完全不可理喻。在自家厨房里，泰勒的爸妈要他坐下来，恳求他，不管Theranos下次要他签什么文档就签了吧，不然他们就得卖房子付他的律师费了。事情没有那么简单，泰勒回答，就无法再多说什么，他很想向爸妈解释，但他被交代不要跟任何人谈起他跟Theranos的协商。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I suspected Theranos was putting the screws to him, but I couldn't confront the company about it since he was a confidential source. I hoped he wouldn't cave under pressure and I took comfort in the fact that he had already sent me his email to Holmes questioning Theranos's practices and the complaint he had filed with New York State. When added to the internal email trail about proficiency testing I had obtained from Alan Beam, it made for a damning trove of documents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我猜测是Theranos给他施压，不过我无法质问Theranos，因为他是秘密线人。我希望他不会屈服于压力之下，同时有件事也令我感到安心，幸好他早就把他写给霍姆斯质疑Theranos作法的电邮寄给我，还有他向纽约州政府投诉的电邮。如果再加上从艾伦．毕姆那里取得的能力测试电邮，我手上的证据可说是罪证确凿了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I pressed forward with my reporting, calling the New York State Health Department to inquire about what had come of Tyler's anonymous complaint. It had been forwarded to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for investigation, I was told. But when I called CMS, I learned that no one there could find any trace of it. It had somehow been lost in the shuffle. To their credit, the folks who ran the agency's lab-oversight division seemed serious about following up on it now that they knew of its existence. They asked me to forward it to them and assured me it wouldn't be overlooked this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我继续把报导往前推进，打电话到纽约州卫生局询问泰勒匿名检举的后续情况，我被告知，那封信被转寄到联邦单位的CMS（联邦医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心）去进行调查，不过我打到CMS时，CMS却没有人追踪得到那封信的下落，转来转去搞丢了。幸好，CMS负责监管实验室的单位知道有那封信的存在后非常严肃看待，他们请我把那封信转寄给他们，并向我保证这次绝对不会轻忽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had no idea any of this was happening. After Tyler's anxious call the evening he had dinner at his parents' house, I tried to check back in with him. I sent an email to his Colin Ramirez address, which he'd insisted we continue using for his protection, and called him on his burner phone. But my email went unanswered and the phone appeared to be turned off and didn't have a voicemail. I continued to try the email address and the phone for several weeks, to no avail. Tyler had gone dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对发生在泰勒身上的这一切毫无所悉。自从泰勒那晚到父母家吃晚餐，打了通焦虑的电话给我之后，我试着再跟他联系，寄电邮到他的柯林．拉米瑞兹信箱（他坚持我们继续用这个信箱往来，以做为掩护），打他的抛弃式手机，但是电邮没回信、电话关机、语音留言也没开。我继续尝试电邮和电话好几个星期，完全没有回音，泰勒就这样失联了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Traub came back to me a few days later proposing that I meet with a Theranos representative at the offices of Boies Schiller in Manhattan. I initially agreed but then thought the better of it. That would be the equivalent of marching straight into the lion's den. I called him back and told him the Theranos representative -- and the phalanx of attorneys I suspected would accompany him -- needed to come to me. A meeting was scheduled for 1:00 p. m. on Tuesday, June 23, at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, home to the Wall Street Journal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后川布回复我，提议我到曼哈顿的BSF事务所跟Theranos一位代表见面。一开始我答应了，不过接着转念一想又觉得不妥，这不是等于羊入虎口吗？于是我回电给他，告诉他，必须请Theranos的代表（我猜想一定会有大阵仗的律师团陪他）来找我，时间订在六月二十三日星期二下午一点，地点在美洲大道一二一一号——《华尔街日报》总部所在地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, Matthew Traub was continuing to give me the runaround. It seemed I was the only reporter in America to whom Holmes wouldn't grant an interview. She had recently appeared on CBS's morning news program, Fareed Zakaria's show on CNN, and Jim Cramer's Mad Money on CNBC. The icing on the cake was when one evening in early June I glanced up from my computer at one of the TVs in the newsroom and there she was in her black turtleneck carrying forth on Charlie Rose. During a heated phone conversation the next day, I told Traub that Theranos couldn't keep putting me off indefinitely. If not Holmes, someone from the company needed to meet with me to address my questions and it had to happen soon, I yelled, pacing back and forth in front of my stoop in Brooklyn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一方面，马修．川布仍然继续拖延我的采访要求。我似乎是全美唯一霍姆斯不愿受访的记者，她明明才刚出现在CBS的晨间新闻节目、CNN法里德．札卡瑞亚（Fareed Zakaria）的节目、吉姆．克瑞莫（Jim Cramer）在CNBC的节目《疯钱》（Mad Money）。六月初某天晚上，我在新闻编辑室埋首于电脑前，抬头正好瞄到她出现在其中一台电视萤光幕，她穿着黑色高领上衣、上《查理罗斯访谈》（Charlie Rose）。隔天，我跟川布讲电话愈讲愈火爆，我告诉他，Theranos不能无限期拖延我。如果霍姆斯不出面，总要派个人来跟我见面，回答我提出的问题，而且最好给我快一点。我拿着电话大吼，来回踱步于布鲁克林自家门廊前。">查看中文翻译</div>
