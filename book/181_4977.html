<div class="line_cn" title="所以，既然阿斯兰来了，你们又来了，一切都得结束了。我们很久以前——具体什么时候，谁也说不清楚——就听说阿斯兰到这一带来过，但这里从来也不曾有过你们人类的足迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's what I don't understand, Mr Beaver," said Peter, "I mean isn't the Witch herself human?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这正是我搞不清楚的地方，海狸先生，”彼得问，“我是说，难道女王自己就不是人吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She'd like us to believe it," said Mr Beaver, "and it's on that that she bases her claim to be Queen. But she's no Daughter of Eve. She comes of your father Adam's" -- (here Mr Beaver bowed) "your father Adam's first wife, her they called Lilith. And she was one of the Jinn. That's what she comes from on one side. And on the other she comes of the giants. No, no, there isn't a drop of real human blood in the Witch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她就希望我们相信她是人类，”海狸先生说，“她就是以此自封为女王的，但她根本不是夏娃的女儿，她是你父王亚当的……”说到这里，海狸先生鞠了一个躬，“第一个妻子李丽丝生的，李丽丝是个妖精，所以她身上既有女巫的血统，又有巨人的血缘。在这个女巫身上，没有一滴真正人类的血液。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So've I, now you come to speak of it," said her husband, "but precious few, and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that's going to be human and isn't yet, or used to be human once and isn't now, or ought to be human and isn't, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet. And that's why the Witch is always on the lookout for any humans in Narnia. She's been watching for you this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she'd be more dangerous still."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也认识，”她的丈夫说，“但真正善良的极少，他们最不像人。总之，你们应该听我的劝告，当你们遇见任何要想变做人而还没有变成的，或过去曾经是人而现在已不是的，或应该是人实际上不是人的什么生灵，你们就必须提高警惕，随时准备好你们的斧子。白女巫总是害怕那尼亚会出现人类，她提防你们已有好几年了。如果她知道你们四个人都在这儿，她就会变得更加狠毒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"True enough, Mrs Beaver," replied he, "there may be two views about humans (meaning no offence to the present company). But there's no two views about things that look like humans and aren't."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What's that to do with it?" asked Peter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是什么原因？”彼得问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because of another prophecy," said Mr Beaver. "Down at Cair Paravel -- that's the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be -- down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it's a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones, then it will be the end not only of the White Witch's reign but of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along, for if she knew about you four, your lives wouldn't be worth a shake of my whiskers!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就要说到一个古老的预言，”海狸说，“在凯尔·巴拉维尔，也就是这条河流入海口附近的那个城堡，照理它应该是整个国家的首都，有四个国王的宝座。很久很久以前，谁也记不清是什么年代了，在那尼亚有这样一种传说，一旦亚当的两个儿子和夏娃的两个女儿坐上这四个王位，不仅白女巫的统治，而且连同她的生命都将一起完蛋。这就是刚才我们来的路上为什么要这样小心翼翼的原因，因为假如让她知道了，她要害死你们，就像我抖抖胡子这样容易。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank. Out they went, plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction. "Edmund! Edmund!" they called till they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, no, he didn't," said Lucy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，没有，”彼得说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All the same," said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, "we'll still have to go and look for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a little beast. And he's only a kid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不管怎样，”彼得几乎用一种哽咽的声音说，“我们还得去找他，他到底是我们的兄弟，即使他是个小畜生，他毕竟还是个小孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Has he been in this country before?" asked Mr Beaver. "Has he ever been here alone?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他以前来过这个国家吗？”海狸先生问，“他有没有一个人单独来过？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then mark my words," said Mr Beaver, "he has already met the White Witch and joined her side, and been told where she lives. I didn't like to mention it before (he being your brother and all) but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself `Treacherous'. He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food. You can always tell them if you've lived long in Narnia; something about their eyes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，你们就听我说，”海狸先生说，“他见过白女巫，他已经加入她那一边了，他知道她住在哪儿。我起先不高兴讲，因为他是你们的兄弟，但我一见到你们这位兄弟，就知道他不可靠。他脸上有一种特别的表情，只有和女巫在一起、吃过她东西的人脸上才有这种表情。如果你们在那尼亚的时间长了，就可以根据他们的眼神把他们辨别出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go to the Witch's House?" said Mrs Beaver. "Don't you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“到女巫住的地方去找他？”海狸太太说，“你们难道还不明白，救他或者救你们自己的惟一办法，就是避免和她接触，不让她看见吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How do you mean?" said Lucy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这到底是什么意思？”露茜说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, all she wants is to get all four of you (she's thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel). Once you were all four inside her House her job would be done -- and there'd be four new statues in her collection before you'd had time to speak. But she'll keep him alive as long as he's the only one she's got, because she'll want to use him as a decoy; as bait to catch the rest of you with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎哟，她一心想的就是要把你们四人一网打尽，她一直在觊觎着凯尔·巴拉维尔的四个王位。你们四个人一到她的住所里面，她正好下手。你们还来不及开口，就已成了四座新的石头雕像。但是如果抓住他一个人，她就会让他活着，因为她要把他作为钓饵，用来引诱你们其余的人上钩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only Aslan," said Mr Beaver, "we must go on and meet him. That's our only chance now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有阿斯兰，”海狸先生说，“我们一定要去见他，这是我们眼下惟一的办法。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, can no one help us?" wailed Lucy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，难道就没有人帮助我们了吗？”露茜大声哭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It seems to me, my dears," said Mrs Beaver, "that it is very important to know just when he slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard. For instance, had we started talking of Aslan before he left? If not, then we may do very well, for she won't know that Aslan has come to Narnia, or that we are meeting him, and will be quite off her guard as far as that is concerned."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的孩子们，据我看来，”海狸太太说，“要紧的是知道他什么时候溜走的。他能告诉女巫多少取决于他听到了多少。例如说，在他溜走前，我们已经开始谈到阿斯兰了吗？如果还没有，我们就照常可以干得很好，因为女巫还不知道阿斯兰已经来到了那尼亚，也不知道我们将去见阿斯兰，不知道我们将尽可能地避开她。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan --" began Peter, but Lucy interrupted him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So he did, by Jove," said Peter; "just the sort of thing he would say, too!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪，正是他，”彼得说，“他就是喜欢问这一类的问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes, he was," she said miserably; "don't you remember, it was he who asked whether the Witch couldn't turn Aslan into stone too?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，他在的，”她很难过地说，“你可记得，就是他要打听女巫能不能将阿斯兰也变成石头吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Worse and worse," said Mr Beaver, "and the next thing is this. Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“糟了，糟了，”海狸先生说，“还有一个问题，当我告诉你们在石台会见阿斯兰时他还在这儿吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And of course no one knew the answer to this question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有谁能回答这个问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because, if he was," continued Mr Beaver, "then she'll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down. In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为，如果他那时也在的话，”海狸先生继续说道，“那么，女巫知道了这一情况，她就会驾着雪橇直奔石台，插到我们和石台中间，在半路上堵截我们。这样，我们和阿斯兰的联系就会被切断。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But that isn't what she'll do first," said Mrs Beaver, "not if I know her. The moment that Edmund tells her that we're all here she'll set out to catch us this very night, and if he's been gone about half an hour, she'll be here in about another twenty minutes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是这还不是她首先要干的事，”海狸太太说，“在我看来，她不会那样干。如果爱德蒙告诉了她我们都在这儿，她今晚就会到这里来抓我们。假如她是半小时以前溜走的，再过二十分钟，她就会赶到我们这儿来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're right, Mrs Beaver," said her husband, "we must all get away from here. There's not a moment to lose."</div>
