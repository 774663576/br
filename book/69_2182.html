<div class="line_en">Lyra and her daemon moved through the darkening hall, taking care to keep to one side, out of sight of the kitchen. The three great tables that ran the length of the hall were laid already, the silver and the glass catching what little light there was, and the long benches were pulled out ready for the guests. Portraits of former Masters hung high up in the gloom along the walls. Lyra reached the dais and looked back at the open kitchen door, and, seeing no one, stepped up beside the high table. The places here were laid with gold, not silver, and the fourteen seats were not oak benches but mahogany chairs with velvet cushions.</div>

<div class="line_en">Crouching behind the high table, Lyra darted along and through the door into the Retiring Room, where she stood up and looked around. The only light in here came from the fireplace, where a bright blaze of logs settled slightly as she looked, sending a fountain of sparks up into the chimney. She had lived most of her life in the college, but had never seen the Retiring Room before: only Scholars and their guests were allowed in here, and never females. Even the maidservants didn't clean in here. That was the Butler's job alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉弯着腰，顺着主桌后面飞快地钻进了休息室的门，然后直起身，向四周张望。屋里惟一的光亮来自于壁炉，此时，木头上熊熊燃烧着的火焰正渐渐地暗淡下去，火星不断地向烟囱里飞腾。莱拉长这么大以来，大部分时间都是在这所学院度过的，但她以前从来没有见过这间休息室：只有院士英国的剑桥和牛津大学实行的是学院制，大学通过各系负责教学，学院则负责学生的后勤生活（包括提供食宿）及社会活动，同时也负责给学生提供一对一的功课辅导。故各学院的工作人员中，除管理人员外，也有一些负责辅导学生功课的教授、专家或学者。通常依照他们不同的学术造诣，给与他们不同的头衔，在此处的乔丹学院（作者虚构的一个学院），“院士”当为最高的头衔了。另外，剑桥和牛津大学分别有三十几所学院，各学院情况不尽相同，因此头衔的称谓亦有所不同。和他们的客人才能进来，女士是从来也不让进来的。即使女佣也不来打扫卫生，这份差使只有男管家才可以干。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She sat in one of the green leather armchairs. It was so deep she found herself nearly lying down, but she sat up again and tucked her legs under her to look at the portraits on the walls. More old Scholars, probably; robed, bearded, and gloomy, they stared out of their frames in solemn disapproval.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在其中的一把绿皮太师椅上坐下来。椅子很深，莱拉感觉自己几乎躺了下来，但她还是再次直起身子，盘腿坐起来，放眼朝墙上的画像望去：他们当中可能更多的是些年老的院士；披着袍子，留着大胡子，一脸的忧郁。他们带着庄严的、不赞成的神情从像框里瞪着眼往外看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What d'you think they talk about?" Lyra said, or began to say, because before she'd finished the question she heard voices outside the door.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“藏到椅子后面去——快！”潘特莱蒙低声说。眨眼间，莱拉从那把太师椅跳了下来，俯身藏在它后面。这并不是藏身的最佳去处：这把椅子位于休息室的正中央，除非她一点儿声响也不出，否则…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door opened, and the light changed in the room; one of the incomers was carrying a lamp, which he put down on the sideboard. Lyra could see his legs, in their dark green trousers and shiny black shoes. It was a servant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门开了，房间里的光亮也随之一变。进来的人当中，有一个端着一盏灯，把它放在餐柜上。莱拉看得见他的腿，他穿着墨绿色的裤子，脚上是铮亮的黑皮鞋。那是个仆人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Butler bowed slightly and turned to leave, his daemon trotting obediently after him. From her not-much-of-a-hiding place Lyra watched as the Master went to a large oak wardrobe in the corner of the room, took his gown from a hanger, and pulled it laboriously on. The Master had been a powerful man, but he was well over seventy now, and his movements were stiff and slow. The Master's daemon had the form of a raven, and as soon as his robe was on, she jumped down from the wardrobe and settled in her accustomed place on his right shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男管家微微鞠了个躬，转身离开，他的精灵顺从地颠颠儿跟在后面。莱拉从自己那个蹩脚的藏身之处看到，院长走到房间角落的一个巨大的衣柜那儿，拿出自己的长袍，费了很大力气才披在身上。院长曾经身强体健，但现在已经七十多岁了，动作显得笨拙、缓慢。院长的精灵是一只乌鸦。他一披上长袍，那只乌鸦便从衣柜上跳下来，落在院长的右肩上——她通常都待在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The visitor mentioned by the Master, Lord Asriel, was her uncle, a man whom she admired and feared greatly. He was said to be involved in high politics, in secret exploration, in distant warfare, and she never knew when he was going to appear. He was fierce: if he caught her in here she'd be severely punished, but she could put up with that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Master took from his pocket a folded paper and laid it on the table beside the wine. He took the stopper out of the mouth of a decanter containing a rich golden wine, unfolded the paper, and poured a thin stream of white powder into the decanter before crumpling the paper and throwing it into the fire. Then he took a pencil from his pocket, stirred the wine until the powder had dissolved, and replaced the stopper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院长从口袋里掏出一张叠着的纸，放在桌子上的葡萄酒旁边。他把盛着浓浓的金色葡萄酒的瓶子的盖子打开，展开那张纸，把一缕白色粉末倒进了那个瓶子，然后把那张纸扯得粉碎，扔进火里。接着，他从兜里抽出一支铅笔，搅动着那瓶葡萄酒，直到那些粉末溶解之后，他才重新盖上盖子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other door, the one the Master had entered and left by, opened onto the busy corridor between the library and the Scholars' common room. At this time of day it was thronged with men pulling on their gowns for dinner, or hurrying to leave papers or briefcases in the common room before moving nto the hall.

<div class="line_en">Then she heard heavy footsteps on the dais. The Steward was coming to make sure the Retiring Room was ready for the Scholars' poppy and wine after dinner. Lyra darted to the oak wardrobe, opened it, and hid inside, pulling the door shut just as the Steward entered. She had no fear for Pantalaimon: the room was somber colored, and he could always creep under a chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，她听到高台上传来重重的脚步声——是管家来了，他想看看休息室有没有准备好，以便让院士们在晚宴后来这里享用罂粟蒴果和葡萄酒。莱拉飞快地朝那个橡木衣柜冲过去，打开柜门，藏了进去，刚把门拉上，管家就迈步走了进来。莱拉不担心潘特莱蒙，因为休息室里灯光暗淡，而且他总可以藏在椅子底下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She heard the Steward's heavy wheezing, and through the crack where the door hadn't quite shut she saw him adjust the pipes in the rack by the smoking stand and cast a glance over the decanters and glasses. Then he smoothed the hair over his ears with both palms and said something to his daemon. He was a servant, so she was a dog; but a superior servant, so a superior dog. In fact, she had the form of a red setter. The daemon seemed suspicious, and cast around as if she'd sensed an intruder, but didn't make for the wardrobe, to Lyra's intense relief. Lyra was afraid of the Steward, who had twice beaten her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她听到了管家沉重的呼吸。衣柜的门没有关严，透过门缝望去，她看见他整理了一下吸烟台子旁边烟架子上的烟斗，瞥了一眼那些酒瓶和玻璃杯。然后，他用两个手掌把头发向耳朵后面梳理了一下，对自己的精灵说了句什么。管家属于仆人，所以他的精灵是一条狗；可他是高级仆人，那么她便也是一条不同凡响的狗。实际上，她现在是一条红色的塞特一种捕猎用的长毛犬，经过训练，可以站定，用鼻子指示猎物的方向。实际上，其英文名字Setter即意为定位。猎犬。这精灵似乎起了疑心，扫视着四周，好像已经感觉到有不速之客了。但是她并没有朝衣柜冲过来，这让莱拉大大地松了一口气。莱拉很怕这个管家，他曾经打过她两次。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her main thought was anxiety, and it wasn't for herself. She'd been in trouble often enough to be used to it. This time she was anxious about Lord Asriel, and about what this all meant. It wasn't often that he visited the college, and the fact that this was a time of high political tension meant that he hadn't come simply to eat and drink and smoke with a few old friends. She knew that both Lord Asriel and the Master were members of the Cabinet Council, the Prime Minister's special advisory body, so it might have been something to do with that; but meetings of the Cabinet Council were held in the palace, not in the Retiring Room of Jordan College. Then there was the rumor that had been keeping the college servants whispering for days. It was said that the Tartars had invaded Muscovy, and were surging north to St. Petersburg, from where they would be able to dominate the Baltic Sea and eventually overcome the entire west of Europe. And Lord Asriel had been in the far North: when she'd seen him last, he was preparing an expedition to Lapland…</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra relaxed a little, and allowed herself to feel the pain in her shoulder and wrist. It might have been enough to make her cry, if she was the sort of girl who cried. Instead she gritted her teeth and moved the arm gently until it felt looser.</div>
