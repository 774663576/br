<div class="line_en">But it's not a cancer book, because cancer books suck. Like, in cancer books, the cancer person starts a charity that raises money to fight cancer, right? And this commitment to charity reminds the cancer person of the essential goodness of humanity and makes him/her feel loved and encouraged because s/he will leave a cancer-curing legacy. But in AIA, Anna decides that being a person with cancer who starts a cancer charity is a bit narcissistic, so she starts a charity called The Anna Foundation for People with Cancer Who Want to Cure Cholera.</div>

<div class="line_en">Also, Anna is honest about all of it in a way no one else really is: Throughout the book, she refers to herself as the side effect, which is just totally correct. Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that made the diversity of life on earth possible. So as the story goes on, she gets sicker, the treatments and disease racing to kill her, and her mom falls in love with this Dutch tulip trader Anna calls the Dutch Tulip Man. The Dutch Tulip Man has lots of money and very eccentric ideas about how to treat cancer, but Anna thinks this guy might be a con man and possibly not even Dutch, and then just as the possibly Dutch guy and her mom are about to get married and Anna is about to start this crazy new treatment regimen involving wheatgrass and low doses of arsenic, the book ends right in the middle of a</div>

<div class="line_en">I know it's a very literary decision and everything and probably part of the reason I love the book so much, but there is something to recommend a story that ends.

<div class="line_en">AIA was the only book Peter Van Houten had written, and all anyone seemed to know about him was that after the book came out he moved from the United States to the Netherlands and became kind of reclusive. I imagined that he was working on a sequel set in the Netherlands -- maybe Anna's mom and the Dutch Tulip Man end up moving there and trying to start a new life. But it had been ten years since An Imperial Affliction came out, and Van Houten hadn't published so much as a blog post. I couldn't wait forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《无比美妙的痛苦》是彼得·范·豪滕唯一的作品，而所有人对他的了解似乎都仅限于：书出版后他离开了美国，到荷兰去过起了遗世独立的隐居生活。我想象过他也许在荷兰全心写作续集——也许安娜的妈妈和荷兰郁金香老爹最后搬到了荷兰，想开始新的生活。可《无比美妙的痛苦》出版后已经过去了十年，而范·豪滕连一篇博客都没有发表过。我总不能永远等下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I understood the story ended because Anna died or got too sick to write and this midsentence thing was supposed to reflect how life really ends and whatever, but there were characters other than Anna in the story, and it seemed unfair that I would never find out what happened to them. I'd written, care of his publisher, a dozen letters to Peter Van Houten, each asking for some answers about what happens after the end of the story: whether the Dutch Tulip Man is a con man, whether Anna's mother ends up married to him, what happens to Anna's stupid hamster (which her mom hates), whether Anna's friends graduate from high school -- all that stuff. But he'd never responded to any of my letters.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="直到我走到他俩面前，我才看到艾萨克的脸。眼泪从他涨红的脸颊上源源不断地流下来，整张脸仿佛一张紧绷的痛苦面具。他直瞪着屏幕，一边伤心地咆哮，一边重重地对游戏手柄又拍又打，瞟都不瞟我一眼。“你好吗，海蓁？”奥古斯塔斯问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Augustus glanced away from the screen ever so briefly. "You look nice," he said. I was wearing this just-past-the-knees dress I'd had forever. "Girls think they're only allowed to wear dresses on formal occasions, but I like a woman who says, you know, I'm going over to see a boy who is having a nervous breakdown, a boy whose connection to the sense of sight itself is tenuous, and gosh dang it, I am going to wear a dress for him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥古斯塔斯的目光短暂地离开屏幕往我身上一晃。“你真漂亮。”他说。我穿了一件多年以前买的刚过膝盖的连衣裙。“女孩子总觉得只有正式场合才能穿连衣裙，但我决定要像一个女人，我对自己说：‘我要去看一个神经紧张到崩溃的男孩，他自己的视觉都快弃他而去了，管他娘的，我要为他穿条裙子。’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这话题有点儿敏感。”奥古斯塔斯解释说，“艾萨克，不知道你怎么想，但我似乎感觉我们被敌人从侧翼包围了。”然后他对我说，“艾萨克和莫妮卡合作社已经停业了，不过他现在不想谈这事。他只想哭，还有玩《以暴制暴2：黎明的代价》。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Isaac, I feel a growing concern about our position. If you agree, head over to that power station, and I'll cover you." Isaac ran toward a nondescript building while Augustus fired a machine gun wildly in a series of quick bursts, running behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“艾萨克，我越来越担心我们正处在不利位置。如果你没意见，往那个发电站跑，我掩护。”艾萨克朝一座难以形容的建筑物跑去，奥古斯塔斯跟在他身后，边跑边用机枪疯狂密集扫射。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fair enough," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“合情合理。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Augustus nodded at the screen. "Pain demands to be felt," he said, which was a line from An Imperial Affliction. "You're sure there's no one behind us?" he asked Isaac. Moments later, tracer bullets started whizzing over their heads. "Oh, goddamn it, Isaac," Augustus said. "I don't mean to criticize you in your moment of great weakness, but you've allowed us to be outflanked, and now there's nothing between the terrorists and the school." Isaac's character took off running toward the fire, zigging and zagging down a narrow alleyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥古斯塔斯眼睛盯着屏幕点点头，说：“痛苦要求被感受到。”这是《无比美妙的痛苦》中的一句话。“你肯定我们背后没人吗？”他问艾萨克。没过多久，曳光弹从他们头顶呼啸而过。“哦，该死，艾萨克，”奥古斯塔斯说，“我不想在你最脆弱的时候批评你，可你让我们被包围了，现在恐怖分子和学校之间什么阻隔也没有了。”艾萨克的游戏角色跳起来，朝着炮火的方向，在狭窄的小巷里沿之字形跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>

The waves of terrorists continued, and they mowed down every one, their shooting astonishingly precise, as it had to be, lest they fire into the school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要抓小孩当人质。”奥古斯塔斯答道。他砰砰地敲着游戏手柄上的按键，肩膀耸起，胳膊紧绷，血管清晰可见。艾萨克身体向屏幕方向前倾，游戏手柄在他细长的手指间舞蹈。“来啊来啊来啊。”奥古斯塔斯说。恐怖分子一波波涌上来，他俩则将其悉数干掉，射击精准度惊人，当然他们也必须如此，因为一旦失手，敌人就会对学校开火。">查看中文翻译</div>

Isaac fumbled for his controller and then started firing while the bullets rained down on Augustus, who was shot once and then twice but still ran, Augustus shouting, "YOU CAN'T KILL MAX MAYHEM!" and with a final flurry of button combinations, he dove onto the grenade, which detonated beneath him. His dismembered body exploded like a geyser and the screen went red. A throaty voice said, "MISSION FAILURE," but Augustus seemed to think otherwise as he smiled at his remnants on the screen. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a cigarette, and shoved it between his teeth. "Saved the kids," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“掩护我！”奥古斯塔斯说着，从墙后面跳出来，往学校冲去。艾萨克抓起手柄开火，枪林弹雨落在奥古斯塔斯周围，他挨了一枪、两枪，但仍往前冲。随后奥古斯塔斯大喊一声：“麦克斯·梅翰是杀不死的！”随着最后一阵疾风骤雨的组合键，他的身体扑到手榴弹上，手榴弹在他身下爆炸了。他的身体四分五裂，像喷泉一样炸开，屏幕瞬间红透。一个低沉洪亮的声音说道：“任务失败。”但奥古斯塔斯似乎不这么看，他望着屏幕上的残迹微笑，抽出一根烟，胡乱塞到齿间。“至少救了孩子。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
