<div class="line_en">Francis Arabin was the younger son of a country gentleman from the north of England. He was educated at an excellent school, and then studied at Oxford University. Here he developed his skill in debating, and became known as an intelligent, humorous, and successful speaker. He was almost always able to make the arguments of the opposing team sound unbelievable, and he aimed to win every debate by using both humour and reason.</div>

<div class="line_en">But his main interest was in religion, and he gave himself completely to the Church. For it he wrote poems, speeches, and sermons, for it he ate and drank and dressed and breathed. Soon he was ordained as a clergyman, and remained in Oxford as a professor of poetry at one of the university colleges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他最感兴趣的还是宗教，并且全身心地投入了教会工作。他为教会撰写诗歌、演说词和布道词，甚至吃喝打扮和呼吸都是为了教会。他很快就获得了圣职，留在牛津一个学院担任诗歌教授。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now came the moment of his greatest danger. After much thought, Mr Newman, a well-known Oxford clergyman, left the Church of England to join the Church of Rome, and Mr Arabin was strongly tempted to follow him. In order to consider what he should do, Arabin left Oxford for a while and stayed in a quiet little village by the sea, far from the complications of civilized life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything seemed to point to his choosing the Church of Rome. He loved and admired Mr Newman, and was eager to follow in his footsteps. He approved of Rome's strictness. "How much simpler it would be," he thought, "to live under religious laws which are certain, how much easier to recognize sin and therefore avoid it!" And he wanted so much to show God that he believed in Him; what better proof could there be than making the great sacrifice of the religion in which he had been brought up, and which was supposed to provide his income?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切迹象似乎都表明他应该选择罗马教廷。他对纽曼先生充满爱戴和崇敬之情，很想追随他的足迹，同时十分赞赏罗马的严谨作风。“有了明白无误的宗教戒条，一切就简单多了。”他想，“认清罪孽和避免犯错又会变得何等容易！”此外，他很想向上帝表明自己对他的信仰。要证明这一点，有什么能比得上牺牲自己伟大的宗教呢？而这宗教是自己从小耳濡目染的，如今又是他的衣食来源。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the time, Mr Arabin was a very young man, too confident in his own powers, and with too little respect for the common sense of ordinary people. But it was an ordinary country vicar, in that small village, who made him see that all true religious guidance comes from within the person, and not from laws made by priests. Arabin also realized that by looking for safety and comfort in the Church of Rome, he was running away from the difficult choice between good and evil. He returned to Oxford a humbler, but a better and a happier man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时候，阿拉宾先生还很年轻，对自身的能力过于自信，对普通人的常识也缺乏尊重。多亏了那个小村庄里一个普普通通的乡下代牧，他才认识到真正的宗教指引全都来自内心，而不是牧师制定的戒律。他还意识到，在罗马教廷寻求安逸，就等于远离善恶之间的艰难抉择。于是他回到牛津，人变得更加谦逊，却也比以前更加高尚、更加快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he became vicar of St Ewold's, the church near Plumstead, he was about forty and unmarried. He was above medium height, with slightly greying dark hair. He was not handsome, but his face was pleasant to look at, and there was a humorous look in his eyes. He was popular with women, but living in an Oxford college had meant that he could not marry, so he thought of women as pretty, amusing creatures, nothing more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到普拉姆斯特德附近的圣埃沃兹教堂当代牧的时候，他已经年近四十，尚未婚娶。他高于中等身材，黑头发略微有些花白。相貌算不上英俊，但脸长得还讨人喜欢，眼里有幽默的神情。他很受女士们欢迎，然而，他既然在牛津学院里生活，就意味着不得婚娶。因此，他只把女人当作美丽而有趣的生物，仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He came to stay for a month with the Grantlys, because the vicar's house at St Ewold's needed some repairs. After dinner with the archdeacon, his wife, and their daughters, Mr Arabin went up to his bedroom, and sat at the open window looking out at his church, which he could just see in the moonlight beyond the archdeacon's garden. It was a lovely evening, but Francis Arabin felt sad. It had struck him suddenly, when he saw Dr Grantly's charming wife and children and their comfortable house and garden, how alone in the world he was. He had given his whole life to the Church, and now he thought that had been a mistake. He knew he could have had a high position and great wealth, and probably a family to bring him joy, but now it was too late. He was the vicar of a small country church, and that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣埃沃兹教堂的代牧住所需要稍加修缮，他便搬到格兰特利家暂住一个月。一天，跟执事长夫妇和他们的几个女儿吃完晚饭之后，阿拉宾先生回到了楼上的卧室里，坐在敞开的窗边眺望自己的教堂。借着月光，他也只能勉强看见执事长花园那头的圣埃沃兹教堂。这是一个美好的夜晚，弗朗西斯·阿拉宾却觉得有些难过。看到格兰特利博士可爱的妻儿，看到他们舒适的住所和花园，他突然意识到，自己在这个世上是多么孤单。他把一生献给了教会，如今却觉得这是个错误。他心里明白，自己原本可以身居高位，家财万贯，可能还会有一个带给他欢乐的家庭，只可惜事到如今，一切都为时已晚。他只是一座乡村小教堂的代牧，仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very easy to turn the conversation to Mr Slope, and Mrs Grantly was soon criticizing him, which she did with her whole heart, and Mrs Bold was defending him almost as eagerly. Eleanor actually disliked the man; she had almost a fear of him, and would have been delighted never to see him again, but somehow she constantly found herself protecting him against what she considered the injustice of his enemies' attacks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要把话题转到斯洛普先生身上很容易。格兰特利太太很快就开始不遗余力地指责他，博尔德太太则几乎同样热切地替他辩护。她其实并不喜欢这个人。她甚至有点儿怕他，巴不得再也不跟他见面，但不知怎的，她发现自己总是在帮他抵挡来自他敌人的、她认为不公正的攻击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The following morning Mr Harding and Eleanor arrived at Plumstead to stay there for a few days. Dr Grantly and Mr Arabin were at St Ewold's, and Mr Harding wanted to walk round the garden, so the two sisters naturally fell into conversation. They had never told each other all their secrets, as Mrs Grantly was ten years older than Eleanor, and they did not see each other often. Mrs Grantly did not, therefore, expect Eleanor to talk to her of love, but she was still very anxious to find out whether her sister had any liking for Mr Slope.</div>

<div class="line_en">The archdeacon was furious when his wife told him, in private, how she feared Eleanor's relationship with Mr Slope was developing. "I am sorry, my dear," he said, "but if she marries that man, I shall not allow either of them within my doors."</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Eleanor, who felt no fatal passion for any man, spent a rather dull evening. Mr Arabin did not seem to notice her much, and he and the Grantlys spent all the time after dinner discussing the various local clergymen. Eleanor began to think, on reaching her bedroom that night, that she was getting tired of clergymen and their respectable, boring way of life, and that she would have had a much pleasanter evening with the Stanhopes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The squire of Ullathorne, the area of farmland, villages and churches which included St Ewold's, was a gentleman called William Thorne. He was about fifty, single, and more than a little proud of his appearance. But he was prouder still of his family name. He had a great respect for long, unbroken bloodlines, and his own family line stretched back to the eighth or ninth century. He believed firmly that all traditions and customs should be kept exactly as they always had been.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Thorne did not live alone at Ullathorne House. He had a sister, who was ten years older than him, and an even greater believer in tradition. Once when her brother suggested making a small alteration to the front door of their house, she took to her bed and was ill for a week; she would not come downstairs until she received his promise that it would not be changed in her lifetime. She would not have a modern magazine in her sitting room, and she refused to read poems or novels by living writers. She had thought her brother dangerously liberal-minded when he was younger, and was pleased that the passing of the years had shown him the importance of traditional values. Looking back over five or six centuries of English history, as Miss Thorne liked to do, she often found reason to sigh deeply. She imagined that an innocence and a goodness had existed in the past, which were not to be found in her own time. However wrong she was, no one would deny her the sweetness of her soft regrets!</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Arabin, Dr Grantly, and Eleanor met Mr and Miss Thorne at the gates of Ullathorne House, and walked to church together. Large numbers of villagers had gathered there, to see their new vicar. In spite of his long experience of public speaking, Mr Arabin felt a little nervous, knowing that he was being compared with the previous vicar. But fortunately most people in the church considered that Arabin did his work well enough, especially as his sermon was only twenty minutes long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉宾先生、格兰特利博士和埃莉诺在乌拉索恩宅邸的大门口跟索恩先生和索恩小姐碰面，一起步行去教堂。很多村民都已经聚在那里，来看他们的新任代牧。尽管拥有多年的公共演讲经验，阿拉宾先生还是觉得有点紧张，因为他知道大家在拿他跟之前的代牧作对比。还好，教堂里的大多数人都觉得阿拉宾的表现令人满意，尤其是他的布道只持续了二十分钟。">查看中文翻译</div>
