<div class="line_en">The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.</div>

<div class="line_en">All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that "the Marches were regularly splendid girls." With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always playing truant and running over to the Marches'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新的友谊像春草一样茁壮成长，各种美好的事情都在那个时候发生。人人喜欢劳里，他也悄悄告诉他的私人教师‘马奇家的姑娘们十分出众’。充满热情的年轻姑娘们把孤独的男孩带进她们的圈子里，对他悉心照顾。她们心地善良而单纯，劳里在这种天真无邪的交往中感到十分陶醉。由于他从小失去母亲，又没有姐妹，因此很快便感受到她们给他带来的影响。她们忙碌、活跃的生活方式使他对自己的懒惰生活感到惭愧。他现在厌倦读书，发现与人交往极有乐趣。布鲁克先生不得不非常不满意地向劳伦斯先生告状，因为劳里常常逃学跑到马奇家去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the 'Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called it. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said "Hey!" so loud, that he frightened her so much her 'feet chattered on the floor', she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而贝思，虽然对大钢琴朝思暮想，却鼓不起勇气走进那间被梅格称为“极乐大厦”的屋子。她也曾随乔去过一次，但老人不知道她天性懦弱，浓眉下的一双眼睛紧紧盯着她，大叫一声“嗨！”吓得她‘双脚在地板上乱抖’，这是她后来告诉妈妈的；她夺路而逃，并宣布以后永不踏足此地，对大钢琴也忍痛割爱了。大家百般劝哄无效，后来，劳伦斯先生不知从何处听到了这事，亲自着手弥补。在一次短暂的拜访中，他巧妙地把话题扯到音乐，大谈他所见所闻的歌唱家和弦琴珍曲等奇闻趣事。呆在远远一角的贝思听入迷了，忍不住渐渐靠上前来，站在他椅子背后悄悄聆听，眼睛瞪大，脸颊因自己不寻常的举动而羞得通红。劳伦斯先生对她视如不见，继续谈劳里的功课和教师，一会，他似乎突然想起了什么，对马奇太太说——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward," said the old gentleman. "The good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要紧，让他放个假，以后再补回来，”老人说，”邻居那位好太太说他学习太用功，需要年轻人作伴，需要娱乐活动。我想她说得有道理，我一直溺爱这小子，都像他奶奶了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What good times they had, to be sure. Such plays and tableaux, such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie played 'lord of the manor' in the most delightful style.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要他快乐，他爱干什么就干什么吧。他在那边的小尼姑庵里不会捣蛋的，马奇太太比我们更能管教他。”这样的时光多么美好！他们一起演戏，一起滑雪，一起在旧客厅度过愉快的夜晚，有时也在大楼举行快乐的小晚会。梅格可以随意进入温室，采摘大捧大捧的鲜花，乔在新藏书室里贪婪地浏览，向老人发表高见，艾美摹绘图画，尽情地沐浴在美的享受中，劳里则非常可爱地扮演“庄园主”的角色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn't some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. "Please, tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind." Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这他站起来，似乎要告辞了。贝思下定决心要讲两句话，因为最后的安排完全乘了她的心愿。”请把我的话转告年轻女士们，如果她们不想来，嘿，那就算了。”这时一只小手塞进他的手里，贝思满脸感激地仰头望着他，诚恳而腼腆地说——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I'm shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine o'clock."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="贝思上前一步，双手紧紧握住才没有拍起掌来。这个诱惑不可抗拒，想到在那架漂亮的钢琴上弹奏，她真是又惊又喜。还没等马奇太太回答，劳伦斯先生古怪地轻轻点点头，微笑道——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝思被他友善的眼光看得脸红耳赤；不过她现在不再害怕，因为找不到话来感谢他送给自己的珍贵礼物，便感激地把那只大手紧紧攥祝老人轻轻拨开她额上的头发，俯下身来吻了一下，用一种少有的声调说——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some pretty, easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝思与母亲狂喜一番后，因为姑娘们不在家，便冲上去把好消息告诉那班残破不堪的布娃娃。那天晚上她高兴得唱个不停，半夜，她睡梦中在艾美脸上弹钢琴，把艾美闹醒，引得姐妹们大笑不已。第二天，贝思看到一老一少两位绅士都出了门，犹豫再三后，从侧门走进去，轻手轻脚地朝搁置着钢琴的客厅走去。碰巧，当然啦，钢琴上摆着几张简单而动听的乐谱，贝思不时四面窥探，终于用颤抖的手指弹响了琴键，旋即便忘掉了恐惧，忘掉了自己和周围的一切，音乐声仿如一位挚友的声音，给她带来难以言喻的快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked. She never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped. Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. At any rate she deserved both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从此以后，一个戴着棕色小帽的身影几乎每天都溜过树篱，一个静悄悄的音乐精灵常常在那间大客厅出没。她不知道劳伦斯先生经常打开书房门聆听他喜欢的旧曲子；没有看到劳里在大厅放哨，提醒佣人不要走近；也从不怀疑乐器架上的练习书和新歌是特意为她放置的；劳伦斯先生在家里跟她谈论音乐，使她大获裨益，她也只以为他是出于好心而已。因此她尽情陶醉在音乐的天地中，有时甚至觉得自己已经得偿毕生之愿。也许正因为她对这种恩赐常怀感激之心，更大的恩赐接踵而来，但无论怎样，她都受之无愧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此后，贝思怀着紧张的心情等着看老人的反应。当天无事发生，第二天中午仍然无声无息，她开始担心自己冒犯了那位怪癖的朋友。下午，她出去办点差事，并带乔安娜，一个残破的洋娃娃，去做日常锻炼。回来走近大街时，她看到三个，对了，是四个人在客厅的窗边探头探脑。看到她走来，她们一起招手，快乐地尖声高叫——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needlewoman, and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. Then she wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝思跟梅格和乔严肃讨论后，选定了图案，接着便购买材料，开始动工。大家一致称紫黑色底衬着一丛庄重而生机勃勃的三色堇非常合适漂亮。贝思夜以继日地缝制，只是难做的部分才偶尔要人帮忙。她做缝纫活儿心灵手巧，众人还未感到厌倦鞋子便完工了。然后她写了一张简单的便条，一天早上趁老人尚未起床，让劳里帮她悄悄把它们捎到书房，放在书桌上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making up," replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all pointing and all saying at once, "Look there!

Beth did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed like a sign board to "Miss Elizabeth March."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你得去谢谢他哩，”乔开玩笑地说。她并没有想到贝思会真的去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝思便弹起来，众人齐称这是有史以来听到过的最美妙的琴声。钢琴显然新近调校了音调，并收拾得十分齐整。贝思脚踩亮油油的踏板，轻抚漂亮的黑白色琴键，众人把头聚拢琴边，脸上洋溢着无限的幸福，此情此景，真动人心弦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking about it." And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the Laurences' door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我要去。我想现在就去，再犹豫就会害怕了，”说罢，贝思竟然不慌不忙地走过花园，穿过树篱，从劳伦斯家的门口走进去，令一家人大为惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see! The pianny has turned her head! She'd never have gone in her right mind," cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老天爷！我发誓我从没见过这么离奇古怪的事情！小钢琴弄得她神魂颠倒了！她脑子正常的话，绝不会去的，”罕娜喊道，呆呆地目送着她走进去，姐妹三人则惊诧得不能言语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman wouldn't have been more astonished. But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly! And was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使屋顶突然飞落，老人也不会这么震惊，但他非常欢喜——啊，真的，欢喜得难以言喻！——那流露真情的轻轻一吻使他深深感动、非常愉快，他彻底软化了。他把她放在膝头上，把自己满布皱纹的脸颊贴住她玫瑰色的脸颊，仿佛自己又寻回了自己的小孙女。贝思从那一刻起不再怕他，她坐在那里与他亲密地交谈，仿佛从一生下来就已经认识他一般，因为爱可以驱除恐惧，感激可以征服自尊。她回家时劳伦斯先生把她一直送到家门口，跟她诚挚地握手，往回走时又轻触帽檐向她致意，腰身挺直，神态庄重，活像个英俊勇敢的老绅士，而事实也正是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice called out, "come in!" she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, "I came to thank you, sir, for…" But she didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果她们看到贝思后来做的事情一定会更加惊异。真的，她径直走到书房门口，毫不思索便叩门。一个生硬的声音叫道：“进来！”她果真走进去，走到大吃一惊的劳伦斯先生面前，伸出手，声音微颤地说道：“我来谢谢您，先生。谢谢你——”一语未毕，劳伦斯先生慈爱友善的目光令她忘记了要说的话，她只记得他失去了最钟爱的小孙女，于是伸出双臂抱住他的颈部，吻了他一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, "Well, I do believe the world is coming to an end."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到这一幕，乔跳起了快步舞，来表达心里的快慰，艾美惊讶得差一点摔出窗户，梅格则高举双手大叫：“呵，我真相信世界末日到了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
