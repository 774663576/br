<div class="line_en">There are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination, and without the possibility of being controverted. You may talk of your dreams; and you may tell what you heard a parrot say. Both Morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses; and your listener dare not attack your recital. The baseless fabric of a vision, then, shall furnish my theme -- chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty Polly's small talk.</div>

New York presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance. She had her lunches in the department-store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week; dinners were $1.05.

<div class="line_en">Piggy needs but a word. When the girls named him, an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine. The words-of-three- letters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with Piggy's biography. He was fat; he had the soul of a rat, the habits of a bat, and the magnanimity of a cat… He wore expensive clothes; and was a connoisseur in starvation. He could look at a shop-girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea. He hung about the shopping districts, and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner. Men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him. He is a type; I can dwell upon him no longer; my pen is not the kind intended for him; I am no carpenter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief; and then she stopped still, and bit her underlip hard. While looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself, a princess, just awakening from a long slumber. She had forgotten one that was watching her with sad, beautiful, stern eyes -- the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did. Straight and slender and tall, with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome, melancholy face, General Kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达尔西转向梳妆台去拿手帕；她突然停住了，使劲咬着下唇。先前她照镜子的时候，只看到仙境里的自己，仿佛刚从大梦中醒过来的公主。她忘了有一个人带着忧郁、美妙而严肃的眼神在瞅她——只有这个人关心她的行为，或是赞成，或是反对。他的身材颀长笔挺，他那英俊而忧郁的脸上带着伤心和谴责的神情，那是基钦纳将军从梳妆台上的描金镜框里用他奇妙的眼睛在瞪着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the door was closed and locked, Dulcie fell upon her bed, crushing her black tip, and cried for ten minutes. General Kitchener was her only friend. He was Dulcie's ideal of a gallant knight. He looked as if he might have a secret sorrow, and his wonderful moustache was a dream, and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes. She used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime, and ask for her, with his sword clanking against his high boots. Once, when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp-post she had opened the window and looked out. But there was no use. She knew that General Kitchener was away over in Japan, leading his army against the savage Turks; and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her. Yet one look from him had vanquished Piggy that night. Yes, for that night.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The horrid, impudent thing!" she said aloud. "And I never gave him a word or a look to make him think it!"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not a good sign for Dulcie to be rude to General Kitchener. And then she turned Benvenuto Cellini face downward with a severe gesture. But that was not inexcusable; for she had always thought he was Henry VIII, and she did not approve of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达尔西对基钦纳将军不敬并不是个好现象。接着，她用严厉的姿态把本范努托·切利尼的脸翻了过去。那倒不是不可原谅的；因为她总把他当作亨利八世②，对他很不满意。（注：②亨利八世（1491～1547）：英国国王，他曾多次离婚，并处决过第二个妻子。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At nine o'clock Dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk, and had a feast. She offered General Kitchener some jam on a cracker; but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly -- if there are butterflies in the desert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九点钟，达尔西从箱子里取出一盒饼干和一小罐木莓果酱，大吃了一顿。她敬了基钦纳将军一块涂好果酱的饼干；但是基钦纳却象斯芬克斯①望蝴蝶飞舞似地望着她——如果沙漠里也有蝴蝶的话。（注：①斯芬克斯：希腊的斯芬克斯是女首狮身展翅的石像；在埃及的是男首狮身无翼的石像，在大金字塔附近。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When her cry was over Dulcie got up and took off her best dress, and put on her old blue kimono. She wanted no dinner. She sang two verses of "Sammy." Then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose. And after that was attended to, she drew up a chair to the rickety table, and told her fortune with an old deck of cards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达尔西哭过之后站起来，把身上那套外出时穿的衣服脱掉，换上蓝色的旧睡袍。她不想吃饭了。她唱了两节《萨美》歌曲。接着，她对鼻子旁边的一个小粉刺产生了强烈的兴趣。那桩事做完后，她把椅子拖到那张站不稳的桌子边，用一副旧纸牌替自己算命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't eat it if you don't want to," said Dulcie. "And don't put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes. I wonder if you'd he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不爱吃就别吃好啦。”达尔西说。“何必这样神气活现地瞪着眼责备我。如果你每星期也靠六块钱来维持生活，我倒想知道，你是不是仍旧这样优越，这样神气。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At half-past nine Dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser, turned out the light, and skipped into bed. It's an awful thing to go to bed with a good-night look at General Kitchener, William Muldoon, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Benvenuto Cellini.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九点半钟，达尔西对梳妆台上的相片看了最后一眼，便熄了灯，跳上床去。临睡前还向基钦纳将军、威廉·马尔登、马尔巴勒公爵夫人和本范努托·切利尼行了一个晚安注目礼，真是不痛快的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This story really doesn't get anywhere at all. The rest of it comes later -- sometime when Piggy asks Dulcie again to dine with him, and she is feeling lonelier than usual, and General Kitchener happens to be looking the other way; and then --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到这里为止，这个故事并不说明问题。其余的情节是后来发生的——有一次，皮吉再请达尔西一起下馆子，她比平时更感到寂寞，而基钦纳将军的眼光碰巧又望着别处；于是——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I said before, I dreamed that I was standing near a crowd of prosperous-looking angels, and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if I belonged with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在前面说过，我梦见自己站在一群境况很好的鬼灵旁边，一个警察挟着我的胳臂，问我是不是同那群人一起的。">查看中文翻译</div>
