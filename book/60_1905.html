<div class="line_en">People in Italy or France have it easy. When their parents force them to go to church, they get back at them by joining the Party (Communist, Maoist, Trotskyist, etc.). Sabina, however, was first sent to church by her father, then forced by him to attend meetings of the Communist Youth League. He was afraid of what would happen if she stayed away.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she marched in the obligatory May Day parades, she could never keep in step, and the girl behind her would shout at her and purposely tread on her heels. When the time came to sing, she never knew the words of the songs and would merely open and close her mouth. But the other girls would notice and report her. From her youth on, she hated parades.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次参加五一节游行，她都无法跟上步伐，气得走在她后头的女孩直骂她，故意踩她的脚跟。该唱歌时，她又从来记不得词，张着大嘴却不出声。不料被人发现，把她告发了。打从青年时代起，一有游行，她就害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz had studied in Paris, and because he was extraordinarily gifted his scholarly career was assured from the time he was twenty. At twenty, he knew he would live out his life within the confines of his university office, one or two libraries, and two or three lecture halls. The idea of such a life made him feel suffocated. He yearned to step out of his life the way one steps out of a house into the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨是在巴黎读的大学，他天赋超人，二十岁那年，就明确了自己的学术生涯。打那时起，他就已经明白，自己一辈子将在大学的办公室、公共图书馆和两三间梯形教室的四壁内度过。一想到这儿，他就感觉要窒息似的。他希望走出自己的生活，如同走出家门到大街上去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I might put it another way: Franz felt his book life to be unreal. He yearned for real life, for the touch of people walking side by side with him, for their shouts. It never occurred to him that what he considered unreal (the work he did in the solitude of the office or library) was in fact his real life, whereas the parades he imagined to be reality were nothing but theater, dance, carnival -- in other words, a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还可以换个说法：弗兰茨认为限于书本之间的生活是不现实的。他渴望真实的生活，渴望与同他并肩行进的男女接触，渴望听到他们的呼喊。他没有觉悟到，他以为不现实的（图书馆里离群的工作），其实是他的现实生活，而被他视作现实的游行不过只是一场戏，一支舞，一个节日，或者换句话说：一个梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During her studies, Sabina lived in a dormitory. On May Day all the students had to report early in the morning for the parade. Student officials would comb the building to ensure that no one was missing. Sabina hid in the lavatory. Not until long after the building was empty would she go back to her room. It was quieter than anywhere she could remember. The only sound was the parade music echoing in the distance. It was as though she had found refuge inside a shell and the only sound she could hear was the sea of an inimical world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨比娜读大学时住的是学生宿舍。五月一日，全体同学都必须早早地到达游行队伍的集合地点。为了保证不漏掉一个人，一些学生积极分子受雇来清查宿舍楼。她常躲到厕所里，等所有人离开很久以后才回去，房间里一片死寂，她从未体验过这种感觉。远远传来行进的音乐声。就像是藏在巨大的贝壳里，远远地听到充满敌意的天地回响着拍岸的巨浪声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so as long as he lived in Paris, he took part in every possible demonstration. How nice it was to celebrate something, demand something, protest against something; to be out in the open, to be with others. The parades filing down the Boulevard Saint-Germain or from the Place de la Republique to the Bastille fascinated him. He saw the marching, shouting crowd as the image of Europe and its history. Europe was the Grand March. The march from revolution to revolution, from struggle to struggle, ever onward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，他还住在巴黎，乐于参加示威游行。去庆祝、请愿或抗议些什么，不再孤单一人，在外面跟他人在一起，这样让他比较好受。圣日耳曼大街上或从共和国大街到巴士底狱那一路人潮汹涌的游行，往往令他着迷。呼喊着口号行进的人群在他看来是欧洲以及欧洲历史的形象。欧洲，是一场伟大的进军。是从革命走向革命，从战斗走向战斗，永远向前的伟大进军。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A year or two after emigrating, she happened to be in Paris on the anniversary of the Russian invasion of her country. A protest march had been scheduled, and she felt driven to take part. Fists raised high, the young Frenchmen shouted out slogans condemning Soviet imperialism. She liked the slogans, but to her surprise she found herself unable to shout along with them. She lasted no more than a few minutes in the parade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开波希米亚一两年后，俄国入侵纪念日那天，她正巧身在巴黎，有一个抗议示威活动，她忍不住也加入了。法国青年举着拳头，高呼着反对苏联帝国主义的口号。这类口号，她听着挺高兴，但惊奇地发现自己却无法响应，跟别人一同呼喊。于是她在队伍里只待了几分钟便离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

She would have liked to tell them that behind Communism, Fascism, behind all occupations and invasions lurks a more basic, pervasive evil and that the image of that evil was a parade of people marching by with raised fists and shouting identical syllables in unison. But she knew she would never be able to make them understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz and Sabina would walk the streets of New York for hours at a time. The view changed with each step, as if they were following a winding mountain path surrounded by breathtaking scenery: a young man kneeling in the middle of the sidewalk praying; a few steps away, a beautiful black woman leaning against a tree; a man in a black suit directing an invisible orchestra while crossing the street; a fountain spurting water and a group of construction workers sitting on the rim eating lunch; strange iron ladders running up and down buildings with ugly red facades, so ugly that they were beautiful; and next door, a huge glass skyscraper backed by another, itself topped by a small Arabian pleasure-dome with turrets, galleries, and gilded columns.</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz said, Beauty in the European sense has always had a premeditated quality to it. We've always had an aesthetic intention and a long-range plan. That's what enabled Western man to spend decades building a Gothic cathedral or a Renaissance piazza. The beauty of New York rests on a completely different base. It's unintentional. It arose independent of human design, like a stalagmitic cavern. Forms which are in themselves quite ugly turn up fortuitously, without design, in such incredible surroundings that they sparkle with a sudden wondrous poetry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨说：“在欧洲，美总是带有刻意的特点，总是先有惟美的构想或长久的计划，比如一座哥特式大教堂或一座文艺复兴式的城市，得按计划，花几个漫长的世纪才能建成。纽约的美则完全来自于另一种源头。这是一种非刻意的美。它无需经过人的预先谋划，就像钟乳石溶洞一样自然天成。有些形态，本身很丑，未经任何筹划，可碰巧处在一个看似不可思议的环境中，突然之间便散发出一种魔力般的诗意来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sabina said, Unintentional beauty. Yes. Another way of putting it might be 'beauty by mistake.' Before beauty disappears entirely from the earth, it will go on existing for a while by mistake. 'Beauty by mistake'-- the final phase in the history of beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨比娜接着说：“非刻意的美。是的。还可以说是错误的美。美从世界上彻底消失之前，还会存在片刻，却是因错而生。错误的美，是美的历史末期。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was reminded of her paintings. There, too, incongruous things came together: a steelworks construction site super-imposed on a kerosene lamp; an old-fashioned lamp with a painted-glass shade shattered into tiny splinters and rising up over a desolate landscape of marshland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想起自己的画，画里也是杂混并列着一些彼此毫不相关的东西：建造中的高炉，背景深处是一盏煤油灯；或者，又一盏灯，那漆成绿色的灯罩裂成细小的碎片，飘散于一片沼泽地荒凉的景象之上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz said, Perhaps New York's unintentional beauty is much richer and more varied than the excessively strict and composed beauty of human design. But it's not our European beauty. It's an alien world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨又说：“纽约这种非刻意的美，比起那种出自人的筹划，过于冷峻也过于工巧的美来，也许更为丰富多变。可这不是欧洲式的美，这是一个陌生的世界。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she recalled her first mature painting, which came into being because some red paint had dripped on it by mistake. Yes, her paintings were based on beauty by mistake, and New York was the secret but authentic homeland of her painting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz greatly admired Sabina's country. Whenever she told him about herself and her friends from home, Franz heard the words prison, persecution, enemy tanks, emigration, pamphlets, banned books, banned exhibitions, and he felt a curious mixture of envy and nostalgia.</div>

<div class="line_en">He made a confession to Sabina. A philosopher once wrote that everything in my work is unverifiable speculation and called me a 'pseudo-Socrates.' I felt terribly humiliated and made a furious response. And just think, that laughable episode was the greatest conflict I've ever experienced! The pinnacle of the dramatic possibilities available to my life! We live in two different dimensions, you and I. You came into my life like Gulliver entering the land of the Lilliputians.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉萨比娜：“有一天，一位哲学家写信给我，说我所讲的一切，不过是诡辩，无从论证，并且说我是‘似是而非的苏格拉底’。我觉得受到奇耻大辱，气呼呼地回击了他。想想吧，这一个微不足道的小插曲，就是我经历过的最严重的冲突！这事，就是我人生可能遭遇的戏剧之顶峰！而我们俩生活在不同的层次。你走入我的生活，就像格列佛到了小人国。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz shook his head. When a society is rich, its people don't need to work with their hands; they can devote themselves to activities of the spirit. We have more and more universities and more and more students. If students are going to earn degrees, they've got to come up with dissertation topics. And since dissertations can be written about everything under the sun, the number of topics is infinite. Sheets of paper covered with words pile up in archives sadder than cemeteries, because no one ever visits them, not even on All Souls' Day. Culture is perishing in overproduction, in an avalanche of words, in the madness of quantity. That's why one banned book in your former country means infinitely more than the billions of words spewed out by our universities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰茨摇头答道：“在富裕的社会里，人们用不着去干体力活，从事的都是脑力活动。大学越来越多，学生也越来越多。为了获取文凭，他们得找到论文题目。题目是无限的，因为一切都可以论述。档案馆里堆的那一捆捆发黑的论文，比墓地还要凄惨，即便到了万灵节，也不会有人去看一眼。文化就在大批的制造、言语的泛滥、数量的失控中逐渐消亡。相信我，在你原来的国家的一部禁书，就远远胜过在我们的大学里随口乱喷的亿万言。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sabina protested. She said that conflict, drama, and tragedy didn't mean a thing; there was nothing inherently valuable in them, nothing deserving of respect or admiration. What was truly enviable was Franz's work and the fact that he had the peace and quiet to devote himself to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨比娜不同意。她说冲突也好，戏剧、悲剧也罢，都不意味任何东西，毫无价值，不值得敬，也不足为奇。大家有可能羡慕弗兰茨的，是他能安安稳稳所从事的那份工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First he sympathized with Cuba, then with China, and when the cruelty of their regimes began to appall him, he resigned himself with a sigh to a sea of words with no weight and no resemblance to life. He became a professor in Geneva (where there are no demonstrations), and in a burst of abnegation (in womanless, paradeless solitude) he published several scholarly books, all of which received considerable acclaim. Then one day along came Sabina. She was a revelation. She came from a land where revolutionary illusion had long since faded but where the thing he admired most in revolution remained: life on a large scale; a life of risk, daring, and the danger of death. Sabina had renewed his faith in the grandeur of human endeavor. Superimposing the painful drama of her country on her person, he found her even more beautiful.</div>

When the sun goes down, the cemetery sparkles with tiny candles. It looks as though the dead are dancing at a children's ball. Yes, a children's ball, because the dead are as innocent as children. No matter how brutal life becomes, peace always reigns in the cemetery. Even in wartime, in Hitler's time, in Stalin's time, through all occupations. When she felt low, she would get into the car, leave Prague far behind, and walk through one or another of the country cemeteries she loved so well.
