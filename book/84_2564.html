<div class="line_en">It was early March when it happened. Shawn sent me an email. It contained no greeting, no message whatsoever. Just a chapter from the Bible, from Matthew, with a single verse set apart in bold: O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? It froze my blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情发生在三月初。肖恩给我发了一封电子邮件，里面没有问候，也没有任何信息，只有《圣经·马太福音》的一章，其中一节用粗体显示：毒蛇的种类！你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢？这句话让我血液凝固。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the New Year I returned to Cambridge, but I withdrew from my friends. I had seen the earth tremble, felt the preliminary shock; now I waited for the seismic event that would transform the landsape. I knew how it would begin. Shawn would think about what Dad had told him on the phone, and sooner or later he would realize that my denial -- my claim that Dad had misunderstood me -- was a lie. When he realized the truth, he would despise himself for perhaps an hour. Then he would transfer his loathing to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新年过后，我回到剑桥，但我与朋友们疏远了。我曾见过大地颤动，感受过最初的震颤；现在我等待着一场将要改变地貌的大地震。我知道它将如何开始。肖恩会思考爸爸在电话里告诉他的话，他迟早会意识到我的否认——我声称爸爸误会了我——是一个谎言。等他明白过来，一小时内他可能会鄙视自己，接着他会把他的厌恶转移到我身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't decide," he said. He paused, and I thought perhaps the connection had failed. "Whether I should kill you myself, or hire an assassin." There was a static-filled silence. "It might be cheaper to hire someone, when you figure in the cost of the flight."</div>

<div class="line_en">The phone calls stopped, eventually, but not because of anything my parents did. They stopped when Shawn cut me out of his life. He wrote, telling me to stay away from his wife and child, and to stay the hell away from him. The email was long, a thousand words of accusation and bile, but by the end his tone was mournful. He said he loved his brothers, that they were the best men he knew. I loved you the best of all of them, he wrote, but you had a knife in my back the whole time.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had a grant to study that summer in Paris. Drew came with me. Our flat was in the sixth arrondissement, near the Luxembourg Gardens. My life there was entirely new, and as near to a cliché as I could make it. I was drawn to those parts of the city where one could find the most tourists so I could throw myself into their center. It was a hectic form of forgetting, and I spent the summer in pursuit of it: of losing myself in swarms of travelers, allowing myself to be wiped clean of all personality and character, of all history. The more crass the attraction, the more I was drawn to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father had visited her -- this I understood immediately -- but I had to read the message several times before I understood what exactly had taken place. Our father had testified to her that Shawn had been cleansed by the Atonement of Christ, that he was a new man. Dad had warned Audrey that if she ever again brought up the past, it would destroy our entire family. It was God's will that Audrey and I forgive Shawn, Dad said. If we did not, ours would be the greater sin.</div>

I was dangerous, she said, because I was controlled by that fear, and by the Father of Fear, Lucifer.</div>

<div class="line_en">After I read Audrey's letter, the past shifted. It started with my memories of her. They transformed. When I recalled any part of our childhood together, moments of tenderness or humor, of the little girl who had been me with the little girl who had been her, the memory was immediately changed, blemished, turned to rot. The past became as ghastly as the present.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读了奥黛丽的信后，过去的一切都变了。变化从我对她的回忆开始。当我忆起任意一段我们共同度过的童年时光，忆起那个曾经是我的小女孩和曾经是她的小女孩在一起时或温情或幽默的时刻，记忆立刻改变了，被玷污了，开始腐朽。过去变得和现在一样苍白可憎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in this state of mind that I received another letter: I had won a visiting fellowship to Harvard. I don't think I have ever received a piece of news with more indifference. I knew I should be drunk with gratitude that I, an ignorant girl who'd crawled out of a scrap heap, should be allowed to study there, but I couldn't summon the fervor. I had begun to conceive of what my education might cost me, and I had begun to resent it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The change was repeated with every member of my family. My memories of them became ominous, indicting. The female child in them, who had been me, stopped being a child and became something else, something threatening and ruthless, something that would consume them.</div>

<div class="line_en">My journals were a problem. I knew that my memories were not memories only, that I had recorded them, that they existed in black and white.

<div class="line_en">I began to defer, always, to the judgment of others. If Drew remembered something differently than I did, I would immediately concede the point.
