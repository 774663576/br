<div class="line_en">The buzzer kept up its song. I didn't like it either. If the visitors should happen to be Eddie Mars and his boys, I might get chilled off just for being there. If it was the police, I was caught with nothing to give them but a smile and a promise. And if it was some of Brody's friends -- supposing he had any -- they might turn out to be tougher than he was.</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't like that. His lower lip went in under his teeth, and his eyebrows drew down sharply at the corners. His whole face became sharp and foxy and mean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不喜欢这阵门铃声。他虎出了上面一排牙齿，咬住下嘴唇，眉毛猛地缩拢，眉心紧皱。顿时他的整张脸透着机警、狡狯和卑鄙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door buzzer stopped humming and a quick impatient rapping on the wood followed it. Brody put his hand in his pocket, on his gun, and walked over to the door and opened it with his left hand. Carmen Sternwood pushed him back into the room by putting a little revolver against his lean brown lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门铃歇了，木门上响起了一阵急促而不耐烦的敲击声。布罗迪把手伸进口袋，握着枪，走到门前用左手打开门。只见卡门·斯特恩伍德拿一把小手枪抵着他纤薄的棕色嘴唇，将他推回了屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brody backed away from her with his mouth working and an expression of panic on his face. Carmen shut the door behind her and looked neither at me nor at Agnes. She stalked Brody carefully, her tongue sticking out a little between her teeth. Brody took both hands out of his pockets and gestured placatingly at her. His eyebrows designed themselves into an odd assortment of curves and angles. Agnes turned the gun away from me and swung it at Carmen. I shot my hand out and closed my fingers down hard over her hand and jammed my thumb on the safety catch. It was already on. I kept it on. There was a short silent tussle, to which neither Brody nor Carmen paid any attention whatever. I had the gun. Agnes breathed deeply and shivered the whole length of her body. Carmen's face had a bony scraped look and her breath hissed. Her voice said without tone:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪从她面前退了回来，嘴里犯着嘀咕，一脸惊恐的表情。卡门关上身后的门，既不看我也不看艾格尼丝。她紧跟布罗迪不放，舌头从齿间微微探出来。布罗迪的双手都从口袋里抽出来了，作势要她冷静。他的眉毛不由自主扭成了古怪的线条与角度。艾格尼丝调转原本对着我的枪口，朝卡门瞄去。我猛地伸出手，把手指紧紧压在她的手上，用大拇指去扳保险栓。原来本来就闭着。我没动它。对于这一阵短暂的无声扭打，布罗迪和卡门都没注意。枪到我手里了。艾格尼丝喘着粗气，从头到脚都在发抖。卡门的脸颧骨突出，好像还有伤痕，呼吸声嘶嘶作响。她的声音平板至极，开口道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Brody swallowed and tried to grin. "Sure, kid, sure." He said it in a small flat voice that was as much like the voice he had used to me as a scooter is like a ten-ton truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪咽了口唾沫，强作欢笑。“没问题，孩子，没问题。”如今他的声音变得纤弱含混，同之前跟我说话时相比，犹如脚踏车对上一辆载重十吨的卡车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Blonde Agnes came to life with a rush. She ducked her head and sank her teeth in my right hand. I made more noises and shook her off.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，等一下，卡门。”我大喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brody grabbed for the little revolver that was so close to his face. He missed. The gun made a sharp rapping noise that was not very loud. The bullet broke glass in a folded-back French window. Brody groaned horribly and fell down on the floor and jerked Carmen's feet from under her. She landed in a heap and the little revolver went skidding off into a corner. Brody jumped up on his knees and reached for his pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布罗迪伸手去抓那把跟他的脸近在咫尺的小手枪。没抓到。那把枪突然“砰”的一响，尽管刺耳，声音却不大。子弹打穿了一扇折叠着的落地窗玻璃。布罗迪骇人地呻吟着，倒在地上使劲拉扯卡门的脚。她蜷作一团摔了下去，那把小手枪滑向了屋角。布罗迪膝盖撑地跳将起来，把手伸进口袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The blonde spat at me and threw herself on my leg and tried to bite that. I cracked her on the head with the gun, not very hard, and tried to stand up. She rolled down my legs and wrapped her arms around them. I fell back on the davenport. The blonde was strong with the madness of love or fear, or a mixture of both, or maybe she was just strong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那金发妞朝我啐了一口，扑向我的腿，想咬上去。我用枪砸她的头，下手并不太重，一边奋力站起来。她贴着我的腿蜷缩下去，顺势抱住了它们。我仰面倒在了长沙发上。不知是爱疯了还是怕疯了，或许两者皆有，那金发妞力气很大，也可能她本来就力气大吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I began to laugh. I laughed like an idiot, without control. Blonde Agnes was sitting up on the floor with her hands flat on the carpet and her mouth wide open and a wick of metallic blond hair down over her right eye. Carmen was crawling on her hands and knees, still hissing. The metal of her little revolver glistened against the baseboard over in the corner. She crawled towards it relentlessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我大笑起来。我笑得像个白痴，刹也刹不住。艾格尼丝直起身子坐在地上，手掌撑着地毯，嘴巴张得很大，右眼上方挂着一绺锃亮的金发。卡门匍匐在地，依旧嘶嘶喘着气。她那把小手枪的金属枪身贴着墙角的护壁板闪闪发亮。她不顾一切地爬向墙角。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hit Agnes on the head with less delicacy than before, kicked her off my feet, and stood up. Brody flicked his eyes at me. I showed him the automatic. He stopped trying to get his hand into his pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又给她脑袋上来了一下，这一次不再那么温柔了。我踹开她，不让她再抱着我的腿，站起身来。布罗迪朝我使了个眼色。我给他看手里的枪。他不再老想着掏摸口袋了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went over to Brody and put the automatic against his midriff and reached his Colt out of his side pocket. I now had all the guns that had been exposed to view. I stuffed them into my pockets and held my hand out to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走到布罗迪跟前，用枪抵住他的上腹部，从他的侧边口袋里缴了他的柯尔特。这下但凡看得到的枪械都归了我。我把它们统统塞进口袋，朝他伸出手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stepped past the crawling girl and picked the gun up. She looked up at me and began to giggle. I put her gun in my pocket and patted her on the back. "Get up, angel. You look like a Pekinese."</div>

<div class="line_en">He nodded again. I put the envelope in my own breast pocket and turned away. Agnes was back on the davenport, straightening her hair. Her eyes ate Carmen with a green distillation of hate. Carmen was up on her feet too, coming towards me with her hand out, still giggling and hissing. There was a little froth at the corners of her mouth. Her small white teeth glinted close to her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又点点头。我把信封放进自己的胸袋，转过身去。艾格尼丝正靠着长沙发在捋头发。她眼里冒着蘸满恨意的绿色毒液，恨不得一口吞下卡门。卡门也站起身了，伸着手朝我走来，还在傻笑，“嘶嘶”个没完。她嘴角挂着一小团白沫。她小巧洁白的牙齿贴着嘴唇闪闪发光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went to the door and looked out. The cool night breeze was blowing peacefully down the hall. No excited neighbors hung out of doorways. A small gun had gone off and broken a pane of glass, but noises like that don't mean much any more. I held the door open and jerked my head at Carmen. She came towards me, smiling uncertainly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走到门口，朝外望去。夜晚的习习凉风平静地吹过走廊。门口没有兴致勃勃看热闹的邻居。一把小手枪走火打穿了窗玻璃，但这样的声响如今已不值得大惊小怪。我撑住打开的门，朝卡门一扭脑袋。她朝我走来，捉摸不定地笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
