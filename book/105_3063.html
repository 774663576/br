<div class="line_en">For the second time, Tristan broke up through the surface of the water. He heaved Dylan up and pulled her head onto his shoulder, keeping it above the waves. Her eyes were closed and her face lifeless. Relief tangled with anxiety inside him. He had been so lucky to find her in the inky water, his fingertips just brushing the hem of her jeans. Not even waiting to right her, he had grabbed a firm hold and swum back up. But he feared he was too late. Was she truly gone?</div>

<div class="line_en">The opposite shore was in sight, and he kicked off strongly towards it. The swim didn't take long, and soon his feet scraped the bottom of the lake as it became shallower towards land.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan staggered up the pebbled shore, Dylan lifeless in his arms. He collapsed a few metres from the water's edge, dropping to his knees and laying Dylan carefully on the ground. Grasping her shoulders, he shook her gently, trying to rouse her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦步履蹒跚地走上了鹅卵石铺成的水岸，臂弯里搂着面色惨白的迪伦。他只走出几米远就双膝瘫软，跪倒在地。他小心翼翼地把迪伦放在地上，扶着她的肩头，轻轻摇晃着，想要把她唤醒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She didn't respond, but lay there unmoving. Her hair was soaking wet and plastered all over her face. He lifted each lock carefully and tucked it behind her ears. Tiny purple jewels that he had never noticed before sparkled in her earlobes. He leaned in and placed his cheek over her mouth. He couldn't hear her breathing. He felt it, though. She wasn't gone. What do I do? Tristan thought wildly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她毫无反应，躺在那里一动也不动。她的头发湿漉漉地贴在脸上，他仔细地把她的每一缕秀发拂到耳后。她耳垂上小巧的紫色宝石耳钉闪着微光，他以前竟然从来都没注意到这些。他俯下身子，把脸贴近她的嘴边。虽然听不到她的呼吸，但他能感觉到她微弱的气息，她还有救。“我该做些什么呢？”崔斯坦脑子里乱极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Calm down," he told himself sternly. "She's swallowed a lot of water." Grasping the shoulder furthest from him, he pulled her across so that she was lying face down with her chest across his knees. Turning his hand flat, he slapped at her back, trying to get her to cough up the water. It worked. Liquid began to spill from her mouth, and then she started to choke and retch, finally vomiting a large quantity of the foul black water. Rasping gasps now came from her throat and he breathed a sigh of relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别慌，”崔斯坦严厉地告诫自己，“她呛了很多水。”他抓紧迪伦的右肩，让她的脸朝下，胸口贴着他的膝盖。他摊开手拍着她的后背，尽力让她把水咳出来。这个办法真管用，她开始往外吐水，接着开始咳嗽、呕吐，最后吐出了一大摊污浊的黑水。她的喉咙里发出像锉刀磨东西一样的喘息声，崔斯坦终于长出了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan came to with a horrible sense of awareness. She was splayed awkwardly, chest crushed against Tristan's knees. She struggled to get her arms beneath her and, realising what she wanted, Tristan helped her up. With his assistance, she pulled herself onto her hands and knees, gasping in air and bringing up the last of the water. The taste in her mouth was disgusting, as if the water had been polluted with foul, dead, rotten things. In fact, it had, she reminded herself, remembering the grasping hands and biting teeth that had tried to pull her under. A combination of shock and cold hit her all at once and she began to tremble violently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦终于带着满心的恐惧感醒来了。她的四肢狼狈地摊开，胸部抵在崔斯坦的膝盖上。她挣扎着把手臂伸到身下，意识到自己想要做些什么，崔斯坦帮她坐了起来。他扶她用手撑着地，双膝也跪在地上。她大口喘着气，吐出了嘴里最后一点脏水。嘴里的味道令人作呕，好像湖水已经被污物、死人和腐烂的东西污染了。事实上也的确如此，她回想起刚才有一只只手紧抓着她，那一排排利齿撕咬着她，使劲要把她拖下去的情景。她顿时被一阵又惊又冷的感觉袭遍全身，开始剧烈颤抖起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She reached out for him and two strong arms gripped her round the middle and pulled her towards him. He nestled her into his arms and began to rub her upper arms and back, trying to warm her. She tucked her head under his chin, trying to get as close as possible to his body heat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦的手伸向他，崔斯坦结实的胳膊抱紧了她的腰，把她拉了过来。他让她依偎在自己的臂弯，抚摩着她的上臂和后背，尽量让她暖和一点。她把头埋进他的胸膛，想贴着他多得到一点他的体温。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm here," he replied, anxiety plain in his voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在！”他回答，声音里的焦虑显而易见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's okay, angel," he muttered. The endearment slipped easily off of his lips, surprising him.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“崔—崔斯坦。”她嘴唇青紫，哆哆嗦嗦地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan felt a warm glow at the word, and the sudden rush of emotion, combined with the adrenaline still coursing through her veins and the trauma that she had just endured, overcame her. Tears welled in her eyes and instantly spilled over, rushing down her cheeks and stinging her cold skin. Her breath came in gasps, and suddenly she couldn't hold it back. She began sobbing hysterically. Her whole body shook and she gulped in air, exhaling raggedly in pitiful cries and whimpers. The sounds tore at Tristan's heart, and he instinctively held her tighter, rocking gently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦听到这话心中浮现一阵暖意，她心潮起伏，再加上刚才的痛苦经历，一时间五味杂陈，不能自已。她的热泪夺眶而出，滑过脸颊，掉在冰冷的皮肤上激起一阵刺痛。她的呼吸也越来越急促，突然之间无法自控，开始号啕大哭起来。她哭得全身都在颤抖，大口大口吸着气，呼气时抽抽搭搭带着哭腔。这哭声在撕扯着崔斯坦的心，他情不自禁地把她搂得更紧，轻轻摇晃着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually she cried herself out. Tristan still didn't move, keeping hold of her as if frightened to do anything that might set her off. Finally though, the darkening sky forced him to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，迪伦已经哭得肝肠寸断，而崔斯坦始终一动也不动，只是搂着她，生怕自己一动就会刺激到她。但是，越来越阴沉的天色逼着他不得不开口说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's okay, it's okay," he repeated over and over again. Dylan understood, but just couldn't seem to pull herself together. She would quieten down for a moment and lie peacefully in his embrace, but then the sobs would resurface from nowhere and she was powerless to stop them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事了，没事了。”他一遍遍地重复着。迪伦心里都明白，但是还不想表现出已经振作起来的样子。她想再静一会儿，安安稳稳地躺在崔斯坦的怀抱里。然而不知怎么的又开始呜咽起来，她已经没力气止住哭泣了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're going to have to move, Dylan," he whispered in her ear. "Don't worry, it's not far."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们得离开这儿了，迪伦。”他在她耳边柔声说，“别担心，走不了多远。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His arms released her, and it felt as if all of the warmth that had been generated by his closeness evaporated. Dylan's shakes returned, but thankfully not the tears. She struggled to stand, but her legs wouldn't support her and her arms refused to do what they were told. Her near drowning had exhausted all her reserves of energy, and she had no will to fight her tired limbs. Tomorrow she would lose him. That thought was all consuming. It made more sense to simply lie here and let the demons come for her. Physical pain would be a welcome relief from internal agony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的胳膊一松开她，迪伦就感觉到刚才紧紧贴着他产生的热力霎时就消失了。她又开始哆嗦起来，不过好在这次她没有哭。她挣扎着站起来，但是腿支撑不住，胳膊也不听使唤。她积蓄的所有能量已经在刚才濒临死亡的时候全部耗尽了，她不愿再劳动自己疲惫不堪的四肢。她现在满脑子想的都是，明天她就要失去他了。对她来说，躺在这里让那些恶魔过来抓还更好些，身体的疼痛能很好缓解心灵的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll get a fire going to heat you up," he promised, for Dylan's jaw was chattering with the cold. She could only nod numbly, though the chill was inconsequential -- a meaningless, irritating side issue that barely registered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到迪伦冷得上下牙直打架，崔斯坦赶忙说：“我等会儿会生火让你暖和起来的。”迪伦只能木然地点了点头，不过寒冷现在只是一个无足轻重、无关紧要的小麻烦，她几乎毫不在意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan had clambered to his feet, and he reached down and hooked two hands under her arms. He pulled her up as if she were weightless, and yanked her right arm over his shoulder. His left arm snaked around her waist and then he half-pulled, half-carried her off the little beach and up a narrow, dirt path to a cottage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦已经爬了起来，他伸出手勾在迪伦的腋下，她就好像处于失重状态一样，轻轻松松就被拽了上来。崔斯坦把她的右臂搭在自己的肩膀上，左胳膊搂着她的腰，然后半拉半背地把她带离了小小的湖畔，走上了通向安全屋的狭窄土路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door of the cottage was old, and its proximity to the water had caused the wood to swell and stick in the doorjamb. Tristan had to let her go to open it, and she slumped against the wall, staring at the ground. He twisted the handle and shoved his shoulder against the door. It groaned and resisted him at first, then gave way, causing him to half fall inside. Dylan didn't move. Going inside meant beginning their final night together; it signified the beginning of the end. She was dimly aware of high-pitched howling coming from somewhere to her left, but she felt no fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小屋的门很陈旧，因为毗邻潮湿的湖畔，所以木头已经膨胀变了形，紧紧嵌在门框两侧的直木里。崔斯坦脱不开手，只好让她开门。迪伦却靠着墙倒下了，眼睛盯着地面。崔斯坦扭动门把手，用肩膀撞门。木门开始发出吱吱呀呀的声音，最后终于勉强开了一条缝，崔斯坦跌跌撞撞地进了屋。迪伦坐着没有动，进去就意味着他们共处的最后一晚开始了，这便是离别的前奏。此时，她隐约听到了从自己左侧传来的高亢号叫，但这次她一点也不害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dylan?" he called. She didn't respond, and the silence was enough to make all the hairs stand up on his arm. He leaped to his feet and was at the door of the safe house in three long, powerful strides. There she was, where he had left her, supported by the stone wall and looking into nothingness with dark eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迪伦？”他唤了一声，她没有应答。这一片死寂着实让崔斯坦胳膊上的汗毛全都立了起来。他拔腿大步跑到屋门口，她还靠在石墙上，深邃的眼睛望着前方的一片虚无。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He led her inside and sat her down in the only chair, which he had placed in front of the flames, and when he shut the door, the temperature in the cottage quickly warmed up. Looking back towards the fire, he was shocked at Dylan's diminutive figure. Her legs were together, her hands folded lightly on her lap. Her head was bowed as if in sleep or prayer. It was like looking at an empty shell in an old people's home, a body waiting for the end. He hated seeing her sitting so alone like that, and crossed the room to be with her. There was nowhere else to sit so he settled for dropping crosslegged on a scrap of tattered rug that lay on the floor in front of the fireplace. He looked at her and wanted to say something. Something to break the silence. Something to bring a smile back to her face. But what could he say?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦领着她进屋后，让她坐在唯一的一张椅子上，椅子已经在炉火前摆好了。他一关上门，小屋里马上温暖起来。他回头望了一眼炉火，惊诧地看着迪伦娇小的身影。她两腿并拢，手微微交叉放在膝盖上，垂着头像是在睡觉又像是在祈祷。看着她就像在看养老院里那些等着死亡来临的空皮囊一样。他不愿见到她如此孤单寂寞，于是走过来陪她。这里再没有座椅了，于是他盘腿坐在壁炉前一块破地毯上。他看着她，想要说些什么来打破沉闷，逗她再笑一下。可说什么好呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on," he said, bending his knees slightly so that he could look into her eyes. They didn't change their focus. It wasn't until he reached out and took her hand in his that she seemed to become aware of him. She stared at his face, and he could see the sadness etched in every feature. He tried to smile in a comforting, reassuring way, but his muscles seemed to have forgotten how and it felt wrong to move his mouth that way. He tugged gently at her hand, and she followed him in silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来吧。”他说着，稍稍屈膝，直视她的眼睛。迪伦眼中的焦点丝毫未变，直到他伸出手攥着她的手时，迪伦才注意到他。她凝视着崔斯坦的脸，他能看到迪伦的脸庞写满了哀伤。他努力做出一个宽慰人的微笑，但脸上的肌肉似乎已经忘了该怎么去笑，嘴动得很牵强。他轻轻牵着她的手，她则默默地跟在后面进了屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan also heard the noises from inside the cottage where he was lighting the fire. He turned to check on Dylan and noticed for the first time that she hadn't followed him inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦正在屋里生火，也听到了叫声。他转身过来查看迪伦，发现她竟破天荒地没有跟着自己进门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan, however, would walk away from her tomorrow and vanish from her life for ever. He would go on to the next soul, and soon she would be a distant memory, if she was remembered at all. Dylan had asked him for stories of some of the other souls that he had guided, and had seen his face twist as he tried to dredge up long-forgotten memories. So many passed through his fingers that no one face stood out more than the rest. She could not bear to be faceless to him. Not when he had become everything to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而崔斯坦却要在明天离她而去，从此在她的生命中消失。他又会迎接下一个灵魂，哪怕他还能想起她来，她也会很快变成他遥远的回忆。她曾让他讲过其他灵魂的故事，在他努力回忆那些久远到几乎被遗忘的往事时，她看到他的脸会微微抽搐。他曾引领过那么多灵魂，没有一张脸会比别的脸更让他印象深刻。她不能忍受自己的面容终将在他的记忆中变得模糊不清，绝对不行，他已经成为自己生命中最重要的人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean?" his reply was only just audible above the crackle of the flames. His whole being screamed at him not to have this conversation, to put her off; he could not deal with her pain as well as his own. But she needed to talk about it, so he would listen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么意思？”他的声音只略微盖过了炉火发出的噼啪声。他的心里在呼喊着，不要这样聊下去了，敷衍她一下吧。他既无法应对她的痛苦，也无法应对自己的痛苦。但必须让她把自己的痛说出来，所以他依旧听着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't do it," she whispered, looking up from the floor to stare at him with passionate but terrified eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不行。”她喃喃自语着，抬起头看着他，眼神既热烈又带着惊恐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't do it on my own. Walk the end of the journey, or whatever it is I do. I'm too scared. I… I need you." The last part was the hardest to say, but also the truest. Dylan had accepted her death with a calm that had surprised her, and grieved only a little for those she had left behind. Surely if she was making this journey then, eventually, they would too. She would meet them again in time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我自己一个人不行的。不管是走完这段旅程还是做别的什么事，只要是我自己来，我都会非常害怕。我……我需要你。”最后这句话是最难以启齿的，但却千真万确。迪伦已经平静地接受了自己的死亡，连她自己都觉得诧异。想起自己还在尘世的亲人、朋友们，她也只是略感伤心。既然她要走上这条路，自然他们终有一天也会来的，她还会和他们再见面的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," he said, his voice even through monumental effort. "If you stay here, eventually the wraiths will get you and make you their own." He gestured outside. "It's too dangerous."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is that the only reason?" If he had not seen her lips move he would not have been sure that she had spoken, her voice was so quiet. But whispered as they were, the words flooded into his ears and formed in his brain, turning his heart to ice. This was the moment, to tell her that he didn't care for her, and make sure that she knew that he meant it. It would be so much easier for her to take that final step if she thought that he was walking away without regret.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有这一条理由吗？”如果他没有看到她嘴唇的嚅动，他根本就不确定她说没说话，她的声音很轻。然而虽然只是轻声细语，却如洪水般灌进了他的耳朵里，凝结在他的脑海，让他的心结成了冰。现在是时候了，得告诉她他不在乎她，确定她明白自己的话是什么意思。如果她认定自己会毫无遗憾地离去，那么她踏上那段最后的旅程时就轻松多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What was he doing? He should not give her hope now, knowing that he would have to take it away again. He shouldn't, but he was powerless. He thought back on all the faces she had shown him -- frightened yet relieved when she had walked out of the tunnel, disgusted and disgruntled when he'd forced her to walk all day and sleep in dilapidated cottages each night, anger and pique when he had made fun of her, embarrassment when she'd been stuck in the mud, the joy when she'd woken to find he'd returned. Each memory made him grin, and he locked them in his mind, ready for when she would leave him and there would be no more to make.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他到底在做什么啊？现在他本不应该给她希望的，他很清楚自己终究得把这点希望再次夺走。他不应该的，可是他实在是无能为力。崔斯坦回想起她曾显露给他的一张张面孔—走出隧道口时既心有余悸又如释重负；白天被他逼着走一天的山路，每晚睡在破败不堪的屋子里时脸上的厌恶与埋怨；受他嘲笑时的怒气冲冲，陷进泥潭时的尴尬困窘，睡醒后发现他归来时的欢喜欣慰。每一次回忆都让他露出微笑，他把这些往事全都封存在了心里，留待她离去从此再无欢愉时安慰自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His pause made her look up, green eyes braced for pain, teeth biting into her lower lip to stop it from trembling. She looked so fragile, as if one harsh word would crush her. His resolve crumbled; he could not hurt her like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的迟疑让迪伦抬起了头注视他，那双碧眼似乎已经做好了承受痛苦的准备，她紧咬牙关好让下巴不再颤抖。她看起来如此脆弱，好像一句重话就能把她击倒似的。他刚才的决心又动摇了，他不能这样伤害她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," he answered. He reached up and grabbed her by the wrist, pulling her down to share the tattered rug with him.

"You can't stay here, even though I want you to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”他回答。他伸手揽着她的腰，让她跟他一起坐在那块破地毯上。他窝起手掌，拇指轻轻划过她面颊光滑的皮肤。在他的抚摸下，她的面颊变得温暖，泛起了淡淡的红晕。“你没办法待在这儿，虽然我很想你留下。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let's just say you've grown on me." He laughed, still grinning from his remembered thoughts. She wasn't able to smile with him; she was still too needy, too on edge. "But tomorrow you have to go on. It's where you belong, Dylan. It's what you deserve."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们这么说吧，我现在是越来越喜欢你了。”他笑着说，仍然沉浸在刚才的回忆中。可她笑不出来，她还有事情没解决，心乱如麻，“可是明天你不得不继续走下去，那儿就是你的归宿。迪伦，那儿才是你该去的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan smiled tentatively at him. Her hand was still on his, and the heat from her touch seemed to burn down into his bones. She released him and he immediately missed the warmth, but then she reached out, fingers hovering in the air just centimetres from his face. The skin on his jaw prickled with anticipation, but uncertainty was painted all over her face and she seemed too scared to close the distance. He twitched the right side of his mouth up in an encouraging smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦像是在试探似的对着崔斯坦笑起来。她的手还握着崔斯坦的手，一股热力从她的手上传来，他的骨头里也感受到了这股灼热。她一松开，温暖瞬间就消失了。但她又伸出了手，手指就在离他面颊几厘米的地方徘徊。在等待她触上来的过程中，他下巴上的皮肤有一种麻酥酥的感觉。可是她还是一脸的迟疑，似乎不敢再越雷池一步。他向右翘起嘴角，露出鼓励的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan's heart was jumping haphazardly in her chest, racing in spurts, then stopping altogether for the briefest moment. Her tired arm ached where she held it aloft, but overriding that dull throbbing was a tingling in her fingertips that almost verged on pain; a pain that would only be soothed by the feel of Tristan's cheeks, his brow, his lips. She was nervous, though. She'd never touched him before; not like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦的心在胸膛中怦怦乱跳，心跳先是时有时无，后来在一瞬间完全停止了。她高举的手臂又酸又痛，然而比这种隐痛更难受的是指尖传来的近似于疼痛的麻刺感。缓解它的唯一办法就是抚摸崔斯坦的面颊，抚摸他的额头还有他的嘴唇。但她心里还在忐忑不安，她还从未像这样抚摸过他呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She saw him give a tiny smile and then her fingers seemed to move of their own accord, drawn in like a magnet. She moulded her hand to the shape of his face and felt the muscles in his cheek move as he clenched and unclenched his jaw. His eyes were vivid blue, too bright for the muted light of the room, but they weren't frightening. Instead they seemed hypnotic to Dylan and, like a moth to a flame, she was helpless to look away. Tristan released her face, reaching up to cover her hand with his own, pinning it against his cheek. Four, five, six seconds of silence ticked by, then suddenly Dylan sucked in a ragged gasp, unaware she'd been holding her breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看到他露出了微笑，手指竟像是被磁铁吸住了一样，不由自主地动起来。她的手贴着他的游移着，感受着他时而紧咬牙关、时而放松牙齿时脸上肌肉的变化。跟屋子里柔和的光线比起来，他湖蓝色的眼睛显得太明亮了，但却让人很安心。那目光对迪伦似乎有催眠的作用，她的目光就像扑火的飞蛾一样，根本没有办法离开他。崔斯坦伸手扣着她的手，让它停在了自己的脸颊上……四秒、五秒、六秒，迪伦忽然急促地吸了一口气，完全没意识到自己刚才一直屏着呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They didn't speak much after that, content just to be near each other in companionable silence. Dylan tried to slow time, to savour each moment. But try as she might, it was like holding back a hurricane with tissue paper. Time ticked on at an astonishing rate, and she could scarcely believe it when light began filtering through the windows. The fire had long since died out, but it had done its job in drying her clothes and warming her freezing body. Still they continued to stare at the grate, watching the charcoal-grey logs smoke. Tristan had shifted over during the night and thrown an arm around her shoulder, tucking her in against his side, cocooning her there. Their backs were to the windows and, although both could see the light trickling over their shoulders and illuminating the back wall, picking out the faded yellow paint and an old picture so covered in grime and dust that its subject was barely visible, they didn't turn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后他们谁也没再多说什么，两个人都陶醉在彼此默然不语却深情相依的氛围中。迪伦想要让时间慢下来，充分享受现在的每分每秒。然而即便她用尽全力，遮挽时光仍如同用一张纸巾抵挡飓风一样，时间依然以惊人的速度流逝。当晨曦的微光开始透过窗子照进屋里时，她几乎难以置信。炉火早已熄灭多时，但它已经完成了自己的使命，烤干了迪伦的衣服，也让她冻僵的身体暖和了起来。他们继续盯着壁炉，看着那深灰色的木柴冒着青烟。经过了一晚上，崔斯坦像变了一个人一样，胳膊搂着她的肩膀，和她紧紧依偎在一起，精心呵护着她。他们背对着窗户，晨光正洒在他们的肩膀上，也照亮了后墙。墙上斑驳的黄色油漆还有一幅满是灰尘、内容难辨的旧画渐渐显现。尽管两人把这一切都看在眼里，但却纹丝不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to break the spell. Tristan moved back, just a centimetre or so, but he pulled her fingers away with his. His eyes were warm still, though, and rather than let go, he guided her hand round to his mouth and dropped a gentle kiss on the soft skin of her knuckles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔咒似乎被解除了。崔斯坦往后退了只一厘米左右，仍然拉着迪伦的手。他的眼神依旧温暖，他没有松开迪伦，而是引着她的手到了自己的嘴边，在她指关节柔软的皮肤上留下了轻轻一吻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan, on the other hand, was surprisingly calm. She had spent much of the night thinking about what might be coming today and had reached the conclusion that there was little she could do but take the final steps and see where they led her. Tristan would be with her. That was enough. She could take everything and anything else so long as he stood by her. And he would. He had promised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而此时的迪伦却出奇的平静。她昨天已经用了大半夜的时间预想今天可能出现的各种状况，最后她终于发现，除了迈出最后的脚步、随遇而安外，她没有什么更好的办法了。崔斯坦会陪着她，这就足够了。只要有他在自己身边，她一切都能承受。他会在自己身边的，他答应过她了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eventually sun-rays blasted through the window, causing the dust that swirled around in the air to shimmer gold in the light. Tristan was the first to stir. He did not want to face today. He thought about what he had promised Dylan, and unease churned in his stomach. His mind battled with what was possible, what was right, and what he wanted. None of them could coexist together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，阳光透过窗子射进来，空气中四下飞舞的灰尘在阳光下闪烁着金色的光芒。崔斯坦先动了起来。他不愿意面对今天。想到昨晚对迪伦的许诺，他的胃里顿时不由得一阵翻腾。此时，在他脑中，可能发生的情况、理性的抉择以及个人的情感正较量得难舍难分。">查看中文翻译</div>
