<div class="line_en">For a week, I barely saw Hassan. I woke up to find toasted bread, brewed tea, and a boiled egg already on the kitchen table. My clothes for the day were ironed and folded, left on the cane-seat chair in the foyer where Hassan usually did his ironing. He used to wait for me to sit at the breakfast table before he started ironing -- that way, we could talk. Used to sing too, over the hissing of the iron, sang old Hazara songs about tulip fields. Now only the folded clothes greeted me. That, and a breakfast I hardly finished anymore.</div>

He called his cousin Homayoun -- he was actually Baba's second cousin -- and mentioned he was going to Jalalabad on Friday, and Homayoun, who had studied engineering in France and had a house in Jalalabad, said he'd love to have everyone over, he'd bring the kids, his two wives, and, while he was at it, cousin Shafiqa and her family were visiting from Herat, maybe she'd like to tag along, and since she was staying with cousin Nader in Kabul, his family would have to be invited as well even though Homayoun and Nader had a bit of a feud going, and if Nader was invited, surely his brother Faruq had to be asked too or his feelings would be hurt and he might not invite them to his daughter's wedding next month and…</div>

<div class="line_en">We filled three vans. I rode with Baba, Rahim Khan, Kaka Homayoun -- Baba had taught me at a young age to call any older male Kaka, or Uncle, and any older female, Khala, or Aunt. Kaka Homayoun's two wives rode with us too -- the pinch-faced older one with the warts on her hands and the younger one who always smelled of perfume and danced with her eyes close -- as did Kaka Homayoun's twin girls. I sat in the back row, carsick and dizzy, sandwiched between the seven-year-old twins who kept reaching over my lap to slap at each other. The road to Jalalabad is a two-hour trek through mountain roads winding along a steep drop, and my stomach lurched with each hairpin turn. Everyone in the van was talking, talking loudly and at the same time, nearly shrieking, which is how Afghans talk. I asked one of the twins-Fazila or Karima, I could never tell which was which -- if she'd trade her window seat with me so I could get fresh air on account of my car sickness. She stuck her tongue out and said no. I told her that was fine, but I couldn't be held accountable for vomiting on her new dress. A minute later, I was leaning out the window. I watched the cratered road rise and fall, whirl its tail around the mountainside, counted the multicolored trucks packed with squatting men lumbering past. I tried closing my eyes, letting the wind slap at my cheeks, opened my mouth to swallow the clean air. I still didn't feel better. A finger poked me in the side. It was Fazila/Karima.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们坐满了三辆旅行车。我跟爸爸、拉辛汗、霍玛勇“卡卡”搭一辆车——小时候爸爸教我管男性长辈叫“卡卡”，也就是叔叔伯伯，管女性长辈叫“卡哈拉”，也就是姑姑阿姨。霍玛勇叔叔的两个老婆也跟我们一起——较老那个满脸皱纹，手上长着肉瘤；较年轻那个则浑身散发着香水的味道，跳舞的时候老闭着眼睛——还有霍玛勇叔叔那对双胞胎女儿。我坐在最后一排，晕车并且头昏眼花，被那对双胞胎夹在中间，她们不停地越过我的膝盖，相互拍打。通往贾拉拉巴德的是条盘旋的山路，要两个小时的颠簸才能走完，车每次急转都会让我的胃翻江倒海。车里每个人都在说话，同时大声说话，近乎叫喊，这是阿富汗人交谈的方式。我问了双胞胎中的一个——法茜拉或者卡丽玛，我总是分不清她们谁是谁——问她愿不愿意让我换到窗边的位置去，因为我晕车，需要呼吸一点新鲜空气。她伸了伸舌头，说不。我告诉她无所谓，不过我也许会呕吐，弄脏她的新衣服。隔了一会儿，我把头伸出车窗外面。我看见路面坑坑洼洼，高低起伏，盘旋着消失在山那边；数着从我们车边经过的货车，它们五颜六色，载满喧哗的乘客，蹒跚前进。我试图合上双眼，让风扑打我的脸颊；我张开嘴巴，大口大口吸着干净的空气，但仍没有觉得好一些。有人用手指戳了我一下，是法茜拉或者卡丽玛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba began to pull over, but I didn't make it. A few minutes later, I was sitting on a rock on the side of the road as they aired out the van. Baba was smoking with Kaka Homayoun who was telling Fazila/Karima to stop crying; he'd buy her another dress in Jalalabad. I closed my eyes, turned my face to the sun. Little shapes formed behind my eyelids, like hands playing shadows on the wall. They twisted, merged, formed a single image: Hassan's brown corduroy pants discarded on a pile of old bricks in the alley.</div>

<div class="line_en">KAKA HOMAYOUN'S WHITE, two-story house in Jalalabad had a balcony overlooking a large, walled garden with apple and persimmon trees. There were hedges that, in the summer, the gardener shaped like animals, and a swimming pool with emeraldcolored tiles. I sat on the edge of the pool, empty save for a layer of slushy snow at the bottom, feet dangling in. Kaka Homayoun's kids were playing hide-and-seek at the other end of the yard. The women were cooking and I could smell onions frying already, could hear the phht-phht of a pressure cooker, music, laughter. Baba, Rahim Khan, Kaka Homayoun, and Kaka Nader were sitting on the balcony, smoking. Kaka Homayoun was telling them he'd brought the projector along to show his slides of France. Ten years since he'd returned from Paris and he was still showing those stupid slides.</div>

We dined the traditional way, sitting on cushions around the room, tablecloth spread on the floor, eating with our hands in groups of four or five from common platters. I wasn't hungry but sat down to eat anyway with Baba, Kaka Faruq, and Kaka Homayoun's two boys. Baba, who'd had a few scotches before dinner, was still ranting about the kite tournament, how I'd outlasted them all, how I'd come home with the last kite. His booming voice dominated the room. People raised their heads from their platters, called out their congratulations. Kaka Faruq patted my back with his clean hand. I felt like sticking a knife in my eye.</div>

<div class="line_en">It shouldn't have felt this way. Baba and I were finally friends. We'd gone to the zoo a few days before, seen Marjan the lion, and I had hurled a pebble at the bear when no one was watching. We'd gone to Dadkhoda's Kabob House afterward, across from Cinema Park, had lamb kabob with freshly baked _naan_ from the tandoor. Baba told me stories of his travels to India and Russia, the people he had met, like the armless, legless couple in Bombay who'd been married forty-seven years and raised eleven children. That should have been fun, spending a day like that with Baba, hearing his stories. I finally had what I'd wanted all those years. Except now that I had it, I felt as empty as this unkempt pool I was dangling my legs into.</div>

<div class="line_en">MY MEMORY OF THE REST of that winter of 1975 is pretty hazy. I remember I was fairly happy when Baba was home. We'd eat together, go to see a film, visit Kaka Homayoun or Kaka Faruq. Sometimes Rahim Khan came over and Baba let me sit in his study and sip tea with them. He'd even have me read him some of my stories. It was good and I even believed it would last. And Baba believed it too, I think. We both should have known better. For at least a few months after the kite tournament, Baba and I immersed ourselves in a sweet illusion, saw each other in a way that we never had before. We'd actually deceived ourselves into thinking that a toy made of tissue paper, glue, and bamboo could somehow close the chasm between us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1975年冬天剩下的那些日子在我记忆里面十分模糊。我记得每当爸爸在家，我就十分高兴。我们会一起吃饭，一起看电影，一起拜访霍玛勇叔叔或者法拉克叔叔。有时拉辛汗来访，爸爸也会让我在书房里喝茶。他甚至还让我念些自己写的故事给他听。一切都很美好，我甚至相信这会永恒不变。爸爸也这么想，我认为。我们彼此更加了解。至少，在风筝大赛之后的几个月里，爸爸和我相互抱有甜蜜的幻想，以某种我们过去从未有过的方式相处。我们其实在欺骗自己，居然认为一个用棉纸、胶水和竹子做的玩具，能弥合两人之间的鸿沟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HASSAN until the middle of the next week. I had just half-eaten my lunch and Hassan was doing the dishes. I was walking upstairs, going to my room, when Hassan asked if I wanted to hike up the hill. I said I was tired. Hassan looked tired too -- he'd lost weight and gray circles had formed under his puffed-up eyes. But when he asked again, I reluctantly agreed.</div>

Most of the boys walked to school, and Baba's black Mustang drew more than one envious look.

<div class="line_en">I TURNED THIRTEEN that summer of 1976, Afghanistan's next to last summer of peace and anonymity. Things between Baba and me were already cooling off again. I think what started it was the stupid comment I'd made the day we were planting tulips, about getting new servants. I regretted saying it -- I really did -- but I think even if I hadn't, our happy little interlude would have come to an end. Maybe not quite so soon, but it would have. By the end of the summer, the scraping of spoon and fork against the plate had replaced dinner table chatter and Baba had resumed retreating to his study after supper. And closing the door. I'd gone back to thumbing through Hfez and Khayyám, gnawing my nails down to the cuticles, writing stories. I kept the stories in a stack under my bed, keeping them just in case, though I doubted Baba would ever again ask me to read them to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba's motto about throwing parties was this: Invite the whole world or it's not a party. I remember scanning over the invitation list a week before my birthday party and not recognizing at least three-quarters of the four hundred -- plus Kakas and Khalas who were going to bring me gifts and congratulate me for having lived to thirteen. Then I realized they weren't really coming for me. It was my birthday, but I knew who the real star of the show was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸举办宴会的座右铭是：如果没请来全世界的人，就不算是个宴会。我记得生日之前一个星期，我看着那份邀请名单，发现在近四百人中，至少有四分之三我并不认识——包括那些将要送我生日礼物以祝贺我活过十三个年头的叔伯姑姨。然后我意识到他们并非真的因我而来。那天是我的生日，但我知道谁才是宴会上的天皇巨星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For days, the house was teeming with Baba's hired help. There was Salahuddin the butcher, who showed up with a calf and two sheep in tow, refusing payment for any of the three. He slaughtered the animals himself in the yard by a poplar tree. "Blood is good for the tree," I remember him saying as the grass around the poplar soaked red. Men I didn't know climbed the oak trees with coils of small electric bulbs and meters of extension cords. Others set up dozens of tables in the yard, spread a tablecloth on each. The night before the big party Baba's friend Del-Muhammad, who owned a kabob house in Shar-e-Nau, came to the house with his bags of spices. Like the butcher, Del-Muhammad-or Dello, as Baba called him-refused payment for his services. He said Baba had done enough for his family already. It was Rahim Khan who whispered to me, as Dello marinated the meat, that Baba had lent Dello the money to open his restaurant. Baba had refused repayment until Dello had shown up one day in our driveway in a Benzand insisted he wouldn't leave until Baba took his money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一连数天，屋子里挤满了爸爸请来的帮手。有个叫萨拉胡丁的屠夫拖来一头小牛和两只绵羊，拒绝收下哪怕一分钱。他亲自在院子里的白杨树下宰了那些畜生。“用血浇灌对树有好处。”我记得鲜血染红树下的青草时，他这么说。有些我不认识的男人爬上橡树，挂上成串的灯泡和长长的电线。其他人在院子里摆出几十张桌子，逐一披上桌布。盛宴开始之前一夜，爸爸的朋友德尔·穆罕默德带来几袋香料，他在沙里诺区开了一间烧烤店。跟屠夫一样，德尔·穆罕默德——爸爸管他叫“德罗”——也拒绝收钱。他说爸爸已经帮了他家里太多忙了。德罗在腌肉的时候，拉辛汗低声告诉我，德罗开餐厅的钱是爸爸借给他的，并且没有要他还钱。直到有一天，德罗开着奔驰轿车，来到我家门口，说要是爸爸不收钱他就不走，爸爸这才收下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I guess in most ways, or at least in the ways in which parties are judged, my birthday bash was a huge success. I'd never seen the house so packed. Guests with drinks in hand were chatting in the hallways, smoking on the stairs, leaning against doorways. They sat where they found space, on kitchen counters, in the foyer, even under the stairwell. In the backyard, they mingled under the glow of blue, red, and green lights winking in the trees, their faces illuminated by the light of kerosene torches propped everywhere. Baba had had a stage built on the balcony that overlooked the garden and planted speakers throughout the yard. Ahmad Zahir was playing an accordion and singing on the stage over masses of dancing bodies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想从各个方面来说，或者至少从评价宴会的标准来说，我的生日盛宴称得上极为成功。我从来没有见到屋子里有那么多人。来宾或是手拿酒杯，在门廊聊天，或是在台阶上吸烟，或是倚着门口。他们找到空位就坐下，厨房的柜台上，门廊里面，甚至楼梯下面都坐满了人。院子里，蓝色的、红色的、绿色的灯泡在树上闪闪发光，人们在聚集在下面，四处点燃的煤油灯照亮他们的脸庞。爸爸把舞台设在俯览花园的阳台上，但扬声器布满整个院子。艾哈迈德·查希尔弹着手风琴，唱着歌，人们在舞台下面跳舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had to greet each of the guests personally -- Baba made sure of that; no one was going to gossip the next day about how he'd raised a son with no manners. I kissed hundreds of cheeks, hugged total strangers, thanked them for their gifts. My face ached from the strain of my plastered smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不得不逐一跟来宾打招呼——爸爸这么要求，他可不希望翌日有人乱嚼舌头，说他养了个不懂礼貌的儿子。我亲了几百个脸颊，和所有的陌生人拥抱，感谢他们的礼物。我的脸因为僵硬的微笑而发痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was standing with Baba in the yard near the bar when someone said, "Happy birthday, Amir." It was Assef, with his parents. Assef's father, Mahmood, was a short, lanky sort with dark skin and a narrow face. His mother, Tanya, was a small, nervous woman who smiled and blinked a lot. Assef was standing between the two of them now, grinning, looming over both, his arms resting on their shoulders. He led them toward us, like he had brought them here. Like he was the parent, and they his children. A wave of dizziness rushed through me. Baba thanked them for coming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跟爸爸站在院子里的酒吧前面，这当头有人说：“生日快乐，阿米尔。”是阿塞夫，还有他的父母。阿塞夫的父亲马赫穆德是矮个子，又矮又瘦，皮肤黝黑，脸部狭小。他的妈妈谭雅是个小妇人，神经兮兮，脸带微笑，不停眨眼。如今阿塞夫就站在他们两个之间，咧嘴笑着，居高临下，双手搂着他们的肩膀。他带着他们走过来，好像拎着他们过来一样，似乎他才是父亲，他们是孩子。我感到一阵眩晕。爸爸对他们的莅临表示感谢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba returned the wink. "I see your father has taught you his world-famous flattering ways." He elbowed Assef's father, almost knocked the little fellow down. Mahmood's laughter was about as convincing as Tanya's smile, and suddenly I wondered if maybe, on some level, their son frightened them. I tried to fake a smile, but all I could manage was a feeble upturning of the corners of my mouth -- my stomach was turning at the sight of my father bonding with Assef.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was dressed in a cotton shirt and blue slacks, a red silk tie and shiny black loafers. He smelled of cologne and his blond hair was neatly combed back. On the surface, he was the embodiment of every parent's dream, a strong, tall, well-dressed and well-mannered boy with talent and striking looks, not to mention the wit to joke with an adult. But to me, his eyes betrayed him. When I looked into them, the facade faltered, revealed a glimpse of the madness hiding behind them.</div>
