<div class="line_en">They could see the fire in the night, glimmering against the side of the mountain like a fallen star. It burned redder than the other stars, and did not twinkle, though sometimes it flared up bright and sometimes dwindled down to no more than a distant spark, dull and faint.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fire is life up here," said Qhorin Halfhand, "but it can be death as well." By his command, they'd risked no open flames since entering the mountains. They ate cold salt beef, hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs, grateful for each other's warmth. It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell, when he'd shared a bed with his brothers. These men were brothers too, though the bed they shared was stone and earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“高山上，火是生命之源，”断掌科林说，“也是取死之道。”奉他指示，自深入山区后，队伍便不再弄出明火。大家以生冷的腌牛肉、硬面包和更硬的奶酪为食，睡觉时则挤在斗篷和毛皮下合衣而卧，彼此取暖。这段经历让琼恩不由得忆起很久以前在临冬城度过的寒夜，那时他和兄弟们同床而眠。如今这些人也是他的兄弟，只是共享的床铺换成了岩石和土地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Watchers in the Skirling Pass," wondered the oldest among them. In the spring of his youth, he had been squire to a king, so the black brothers still called him Squire Dalbridge. "What is it Mance Rayder fears, I wonder?"</div>

One of the garrons whickered and pawed at the thin stony soil of the hollow where they had taken shelter. "The wolf will remain with us," Qhorin said. "White fur is seen too easily by moonlight." He turned to Stonesnake. "When it's done, throw down a burning brand. We'll come when we see it fall."</div>

<div class="line_en">They each took a long coil of rope. Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well, and a small hammer with its head wrapped in thick felt.

<div class="line_cn" title="两人各拿一大卷绳索。石蛇还带了一袋铁钉，一个顶端包裹厚毛毡的小锤。他们把马、头盔、铠甲和白灵一块儿留下。临出发时，琼恩跪在冰原狼面前，任狼用鼻子拱他。“留下来，”他命令，“我会回来找你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks, working their way up a steep, twisting trail as their breath frosted in the black air. Jon felt almost naked without his mail, but he did not miss its weight. This was hard going, and slow. To hurry here was to risk a broken ankle or worse. Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一对黑衣兄弟走在漆黑岩石中的漆黑阴影里，朝峭壁行去，留下弯曲的轨迹，呼吸在漆黑的空气中结霜。没穿盔甲的琼恩觉得自己赤裸无依，所幸行动更加便利。一路艰苦又缓慢，只因若是匆忙，就得冒摔断膝盖甚至更大的危险。石蛇似乎本能地知道如何下脚，但在这破碎不平的大地上，琼恩只能步步为营，加倍小心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stonesnake took the lead. He was a short wiry man, near fifty and grey of beard but stronger than he seemed, and he had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known. He needed them tonight. By day the mountains were blue-grey, brushed with frost, but once the sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned black. Now the rising moon had linmed them in white and silver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="石蛇带头。他是个矮瘦男子，将近五十，胡子灰白，但身体比外表看上去要结实得多，也是琼恩所认识的人中夜视能力最佳的一位——今晚正好派上用场。白天，群山一片蓝灰，覆盖冰雪，当太阳消失在参差的峰峦后，一切又成了黑色。而今，明月高挂，将它们染成银白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Skirling Pass was really a series of passes, a long twisting course that went up around a succession of icy wind-carved peaks and down through hidden valleys that seldom saw the sun. Apart from his companions, Jon had glimpsed no living man since they'd left the wood behind and begun to make their way upward. The Frostfangs were as cruel as any place the gods had made, and as inimical to men. The wind cut like a knife up here, and shrilled in the night like a mother mourning her slain children. What few trees they saw were stunted, grotesque things growing sideways out of cracks and fissures. Tumbled shelves of rock often overhung the trail, fringed with hanging icicles that looked like long white teeth from a distance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风声峡是一长串名副其实的峡谷，漫长而曲折，时而环绕连绵起伏的风雪群山，时而成为不见天日的隐蔽峡道。自从离开森林上山以来，除了自己的伙伴，琼恩未见其他活人。霜雪之牙是诸神所造最为残酷无情之处，对人类饱含敌意。这里风如剃刀，在寒夜中发出尖啸，仿佛母亲在痛悼孩儿；这里的树寥寥无几，且短小猥琐，狼狈地挤在岩缝和裂沟中；小径上方常悬层层岩片，边沿挂着冰柱，远远观之，好似雪白的獠牙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come. There were wonders here as well. He had seen sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone cliffs, and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers, blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet frostfires and stands of piper's grass in russet and gold. He had peered down ravines so deep and black they seemed certain to end in some hell, and he had ridden his garron over a wind-eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side. Eagles nested in the heights and came down to hunt the valleys, circling effortlessly on great blue-grey wings that seemed almost part of the sky. Once he had watched a shadowcat stalk a ram, flowing down the mountainside like liquid smoke until it was ready to pounce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便如此，琼恩并不后悔走这一遭，因为这里也是奇迹之地。他们走过陡峭的石壁边缘，见识了阳光在覆着薄冰的瀑布上闪耀的美景；他们游历长满秋日野花的山间草坪，有蓝色的冰心花、猩红明亮的冷霜火，还有人立起来、赤褐金黄的笛手草；深邃漆黑的洞穴，他简直以为其直通地狱；他还骑马穿越历经风蚀的天然石桥，两边除了无尽长空，什么也没有。老鹰在绝壁上筑巢，到峡沟中捕猎，不知疲倦地张开雄健的蓝灰翅膀，盘桓飞扬，几乎和天空融为一体。有一回他甚至目睹影子山猫猎袭公羊，它如山腹中缓缓溢出的流动烟雾，等待，然后扑杀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as it snaked along the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward. Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself and they lost sight of the fire, but soon or late it would always reappear. The path Stonesnake chose would never have served for the horses. In places Jon had to put his back to the cold stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab, inch by inch. Even where the track widened it was treacherous; there were cracks big enough to swallow a man's leg, rubble to stumble over, hollow places where the water pooled by day and froze hard by night. One step and then another, Jon told himself. One step and then another, and I will not fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沿着小径走了许久，在山的侧面蛇行、蜿蜒、转折，不断向上、向上。某些时候，群山相互包庇，无从窥见远方的篝火，但只要走下去，它必在前方重复出现。石蛇挑选的道路根本不容马行，有的地方连琼恩也不得不将背脊贴上冰冷的石头，如螃蟹般拖着脚一寸一寸地钻过去。路径变宽往往不是好事：那将出现大得能吞噬人脚的深洞，无数绊人的碎石以及白天流动、夜晚冷凝的水坑。一步一个脚印小心走，琼恩告诉自己。一步一个脚印，我决不会摔落。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it is our turn to pounce. He wished he could move as sure and silent as that shadowcat, and kill as quickly. Longclaw was sheathed across his back, but he might not have room to use it. He carried dirk and dagger for closer work. They will have weapons as well, and I am not armored. He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night's end, and who the ram.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在轮到我们扑杀。他希望自己能像影子山猫一样坚定而沉寂，毙敌干净利落。长爪背在后背，但他担心使用的空间，于是也准备好小刀和匕首。对方会有武器，而我没穿护甲。他不禁怀疑今晚谁是影子山猫，谁又来扮演公羊的角色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon they were high enough so that looking down was best not considered. There was nothing below but yawning blackness, nothing above but moon and stars. "The mountain is your mother," Stonesnake had told him during an easier climb a few days past. "Cling to her, press your face up against her teats, and she won't drop you." Jon had made a joke of it, saying how he'd always wondered who his mother was, but never thought to find her in the Frostfangs. It did not seem nearly so amusing now. One step and then another, he thought, clinging tight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，他们所达到的高度便不允许往下察看了。身下为无尽黑暗，头顶是皓月繁星，天地之间，别无他物。“大山就是你的母亲，”几天前，当他们攀登不这么险峻的山峦时，石蛇便告诉过他。“紧紧搂住，将你的脸庞贴紧她的乳房，她决不会遗弃你。”当时琼恩开了个玩笑，说自己一直在找寻生母，没想到在霜雪之牙和她团聚。如今这变得不那么好笑。一步一个脚印，我决不会摔落，他心想，抓得更紧了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had not shaved since leaving the Fist of the First Men, and the hair on his lip was soon stiff with frost. Two hours into the climb, the wind kicked up so fiercely that it was all he could do to hunch down and cling to the rock, praying he would not be blown off the mountain. One step and then another, he resumed when the gale subsided. One step and then another, and I will not fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自离开先民拳峰，他便没有修面，如今唇边的胡须已被霜雪冻成一块。经过两个钟头的攀登，寒风变得如此猛烈，他只能使出全身力气拼命挪动，攀附峭壁，心里默默祈祷不被吹下去。一步一个脚印，当狂风暂时止息，他又对自己强调。一步一个脚印，我决不会摔落。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The narrow track ended abruptly where a massive shoulder of black granite thrust out from the side of the mountain. After the bright moonlight, its shadow was so black that it felt like stepping into a cave. "Straight up here," the ranger said in a quiet voice. "We want to get above them." He peeled off his gloves, tucked them through his belt, tied one end of his rope around his waist, the other end around Jon. "Follow me when the rope grows taut." The ranger did not wait for an answer but started at once, moving upward with fingers and feet, faster than Jon would have believed. The long rope unwound slowly. Jon watched him closely, making note of how he went, and where he found each handhold, and when the last loop of hemp uncoiled, he took off his own gloves and followed, much more slowly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="窄路在一块突出的厚重黑花岗岩前嘎然而止。明亮的月光下，岩石撒下的阴影黑如洞窟。“直着上，”游骑兵平静地说，“爬到他们顶上去。”他摘下手套，塞进腰带，将绳子一头捆住自己腰部，另一头捆住琼恩的腰。“绳子绷紧就跟上。”游骑兵不等回答立即出发，手脚并用，动作快得超乎琼恩想像。长长的绳索缓慢释放。琼恩靠近来观察，认真学习对方移动的姿势，记下每个落脚支撑之处。当最后一卷麻绳也被松开，他连忙摘下手套跟进，速度则迟缓了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once his foot slipped as he put his weight on it and his heart stopped in his chest, but the gods were good and he did not fall. He could feel the cold seeping off the rock into his fingers, but he dared not don his gloves; gloves would slip, no matter how tight they seemed, cloth and fur moving between skin and stone, and up here that could kill him. His burned hand was stiffening up on him, and soon it began to ache. Then he ripped open his thumbnail somehow, and after that he left smears of blood wherever he put his hand. He hoped he still had all his fingers by the end of the climb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一度一脚踩空，胸膛里的心脏顿时停止了跳动，但诸神保佑，没有摔下去。岩石里的寒气渗进指尖，他却不敢戴上手套——不管它们昨看起来多紧密，毛皮和布料在皮肤与石头之间摩擦，都是会打滑，害他送命的。烧伤的手掌逐渐僵硬、疼痛。不知何时，拇指甲也掉了，手到之处便留下一抹抹鲜血。他只希望到达终点时十指还健全。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stonesnake had passed the rope around the smooth spike of rock he was waiting on, but as soon as Jon reached him he shook it loose and was off again. This time there was no convenient cleft when he reached the end of their tether, so he took out his felt-headed hammer and drove a spike deep into a crack in the stone with a series of gentle taps. Soft as the sounds were, they echoed off the stone so loudly that Jon winced with every blow, certain that the wildlings must hear them too. When the spike was secure, Stonesnake secured the rope to it, and Jon started after him. Suck on the mountain's teat, he reminded himself. Don't look down. Keep your weight above your feet. Don't look down. Look at the rock in front of you. There's a good handhold, yes. Don't look down. I can catch a breath on that ledge there, all I need to do is reach it. Never look down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="石蛇将绳子绕上平滑突出的山石，人在旁边等候，一伺琼恩接近，便又放松开来，继续前进。这一次当绳子拉张完毕，却没了适宜的岩石，于是他拿出毛毡包裹的锤子，轻轻敲打，将铁钉凿进山石。声音虽轻，但每一击都在岩壁间回荡，使得琼恩不住畏缩，以为野人们定能听见。当铁钉扎好，石蛇将绳子系牢，琼恩便即跟进。吮紧大山的奶子，他提醒自己。别低头。重心放脚上。别低头。盯着眼前的石头。这钉子很牢，是的。别低头。撑到那块悬壁就能喘口气，所以快走！决不低头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wall was broken two-thirds of the way up by a crooked fissure of icy stone. Stonesnake reached down a hand to help him up. He had donned his gloves again, so Jon did the same. The ranger moved his head to the left, and the two of them crawled along the shelf three hundred yards or more, until they could see the dull orange glow beyond the lip of the cliff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岩墙在三分之二高的地方被一道冰石裂沟所横断。石蛇伸手助他攀越。见他已重戴手套，琼恩也照办。上顶之后，游骑兵扭身向左，他俩在平台上爬行近三百尺，直到透过峭壁边缘，看见昏暗的橙色光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Up they went, and up, and up, black shadows creeping across the moonlit wall of rock. Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen them easily, but the mountain hid them from the view of the wildlings by their fire. They were close now, though. Jon could sense it. Even so, he did not think of the foes who were waiting for him, all unknowing, but of his brother at Winterfell. Bran used to love to climb. I wish I had a tenth part of his courage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们向上攀登，向上，向上，犹如两道蠕动在月光照耀的岩墙上的黑影。任何站在峡谷的人都能轻易发现他们，但高山遮挡了野人的营火。他们应该很近了，琼恩感觉得到。但他心中所想却不是毫无防备、等候着他的敌人，而是临冬城里的兄弟。布兰那么爱攀爬，我要有他十分之一的勇气就好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wildlings had built their watchfire in a shallow depression above the narrowest part of the pass, with a sheer drop below and rock behind to shelter them from the worst of the wind.

<div class="line_en">One was asleep, curled up tight and buried beneath a great mound of skins. Jon could see nothing of him but his hair, bright red in the firelight. The second sat close to the flames, feeding them twigs and branches and complaining of the wind in a querulous tone. The third watched the pass, though thele was little to see, only a vast bowl of darkness ringed by the snowy shoulders of the mountains. It was the watcher who wore the horn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一人睡着了，紧紧蜷身，埋在小山似的毛皮底，琼恩只能看见篝火下鲜红的头发。第二人紧靠火堆而坐，正往里添树枝，一边唠唠叨叨地抱怨寒风。最后一人守望峡道，虽然现在没什么可看，只有环绕积雪峰峦的无尽黑暗，但他并未松懈。号角正在他身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three. For a moment Jon was uncertain. There was only supposed to be two. One was asleep, though. And whether there was two or three or twenty, he still must do what he had come to do. Stonesnake touched his arm, pointed at the wildling with the horn. Jon nodded toward the one by the fire. It felt queer, picking a man to kill. Half the days of his life had been spent with sword and shield, training for this moment. Did Robb feel this way before his first battle? he wondered, but there was no time to ponder the question. Stonesnake moved as fast as his namesake, leaping down on the wildlings in a rain of pebbles. Jon slid Longclaw from its sheath and followed.</div>

<div class="line_en">It all seemed to happen in a heartbeat. Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the wildling who reached first for his horn instead of his blade. He got it to his lips, but before he could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of his shortsword. Jon's man leapt to his feet, thrusting at his face with a burning brand. He could feel the heat of the flames as he flinched back. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the sleeper stirring, and knew he must finish his man quick. When the brand swung again, he bulled into it, swinging the bastard sword with both hands.

<div class="line_cn" title="天亮之时，断掌科林终于赶到。东方的天空变为靛青，漆黑的山岩由黑转蓝。石蛇首先发现跋涉而上的游骑兵们，琼恩便弄醒他的俘虏，捉住她的胳膊，下去会合。谢天谢地，这里有其他道路通往山峦的北方和西方，且都比来时攀登的途径好走。前进一段之后，他们等在一个狭窄的隘口，直到兄弟们牵马出现。白灵嗅到气味，跑在最前。琼恩连忙蹲下，任冰原狼用嘴咬住他的手腕，使劲拖来拉去，这是他们之间常玩的游戏。但当他抬头，却发现耶哥蕊特望着他，眼睛睁得鸡蛋似的又大又白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye," she said, "but the gods hate kinslayers, even when they kill unknowing. When Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael's head upon his spear, she threw herself from a tower in her grief. Her son did not long outlive her. One o' his lords peeled the skin off him and wore him for a cloak."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”她道，“但诸神诅咒弑亲者，即便他是无意犯下的过错。当史塔克大人作战归来，他母亲远远望见儿子枪尖上贝尔的头颅，便在悲伤之中纵身从高塔跳下。做儿子的也没活多久，他后来被手下某位领主剥了皮，并拿皮当斗篷。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your Bael was a liar," he told her, certain now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说的这个贝尔在撒谎。”琼恩告诉她，这怎么可能？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Ygritte said, "but a bard's truth is different than yours or mine. Anyway, you asked for the story, so I told it." She turned away from him, closed her eyes, and seemed to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不对，”耶哥蕊特说，“我只能说诗人承诺的真相和你我心目中的真实并不雷同。反正，你要我说故事，我也告诉了你。”她转头不再看他，闭上眼睛，似乎要睡了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Qhorin Halfhand." The girl looked half a child beside him, but she faced him boldly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon's throat was raw. He looked at them all helplessly. "She yielded herself to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩只觉喉咙干燥。他无助地看着其他人。“她对我投降了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We passed two," Ebben said, "or what the cats had left of them." He eyed the girl sourly, suspicion plain on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“前两个我们在路上刚见过，”伊班道，“至少见到了猫留下的残骸。”他乖僻地打量女孩，怀疑清楚地写在脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The way before us is perilous enough, lad," said Squire Dalbridge. "One shout when we need silence, and every man of us is doomed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“前路艰险，小子，”侍从戴里吉说，“当需要安静的时候一声喊，咱们就全完了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you must do what needs be done," Qhorin Halfhand said. "You are the blood of Winterfell and a man of the Night's Watch." He looked at the others. "Come, brothers. Leave him to it. It will go easier for him if we do not watch." And he led them up the steep twisting trail toward the pale pink glow of the sun where it broke through a mountain cleft, and before very long only Jon and Ghost remained with the wildling girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你就得做你该做的事，”断掌科林说，“记住，你是临冬城的血脉，守夜人的汉子。”他望向其他人。“走吧，兄弟们。让他自己完成。咱们不在场会让他好过些。”说完他率领人们踏上险峻扭曲的小径，迎着粉红的阳光，朝山峰隘口走去。不久之后，原地只剩琼恩、白灵和野人女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought Ygritte might try to run, but she only stood there, waiting, looking at him. "You never killed a woman before, did you?" When he shook his head, she said, "We die the same as men. But you don't need to do it. Mance would take you, I know he would. There's secret ways. Them crows would never catch us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他以为耶哥蕊特会逃跑，但她只是站在那儿，一动不动，盯着他瞧。“你没杀过女人，对不对？”他摇摇头，她接着说，“我们和男人一样会死。不过，你不必杀我。听我说，曼斯会收留你，我知道他会。这里有秘密通路。那些乌鸦永远抓不到我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“昨晚很怕，”她承认。“但如今太阳已然升起。”她拨开头发，露出脖子，跪在他面前。“狠狠地、照准了斩，乌鸦，不然我做鬼也来找你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="长爪不若父亲的寒冰那般颀长沉重，但依旧是瓦雷利亚钢制成。他久久触碰刀锋，估算挥击的位置，此时耶哥蕊特开始颤抖。“好冷，”她说，“快，动手吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
