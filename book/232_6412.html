<div class="line_en">And then what? On the night before the bombing, he and Anna had been out for a meal in a restaurant. Then 'they had gone to the Mews to look at the horses. The guards knew she was his girlfriend, so they didn't think it was unusual. One of the horses, Sandman, had hurt his leg that morning, Alan remembered. In the evening the leg had been hot, so he had put ice on it. Lucky Sandman, Alan thought -- he couldn't pull the coach next day, so he was still alive now.</div>

Jane could hear from Kev's voice that he was Irish, and he and Anna had moved out of Bowater Gardens on the morning of the bombing.
