<div class="line_en">Harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported him through Umbridge's classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes. He and the DA were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing she and the Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard's book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings' hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for the DA meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate: team's Quidditch practices, which were often rearranged due to bad weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this; he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable. If anyone was watching them, it would be hard to make out a pattern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发现几乎无法把D.A。的集会固定在一星期的某个晚上，因为要避开三支魁地奇球队的训练，而且它们常因天气情况而变更。但哈利并不烦恼，他觉得集会时间不固定或许更好。如果有人监视他们的话，倒不容易找出规律。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?" Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. "On real Galleons that's just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you're carrying them in a pocket you'll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he'll change the numbers on his coin, and because I've put a Protean Charm on them, they'll all change to mimic his."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看到硬币边缘的数字了吗？”第四次集会结束时，赫敏举起一枚硬币给大家看。硬币在火把照耀下发出黄灿灿的光芒。“在真加隆上它只是一个编号，代表铸成这枚硬币的妖精。但这些假币上的数字会变动，显示下次集会的时间。改时间时硬币会发热，如果你把它放在口袋里，就会感觉到。我们每人拿一枚，哈利确定了下次集会时间，就修改他硬币上的数字，因为我施了一个变化咒，大家的硬币都会同样变化。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often. She gave each of the members of the DA a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he first saw the basket and was convinced she was actually giving out gold).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏很快想出了一种很聪明的方式，用来在有临时变更的情况下通知所有成员下次集会时间。因为如果不同学院的人频繁地穿过礼堂去交谈，容易令人起疑。她给每个成员一枚假加隆（罗恩第一次看到篮子时很兴奋，以为她真的发金币呢）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their DA meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game; the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship, were determined to see their own side victorious. Harry realised how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着本赛季的第一场魁地奇球赛——格兰芬多与斯莱特林队交锋的临近，D.A。的集会暂停了，因为安吉利娜坚持几乎每天训练。由于魁地奇杯长期没有赛事，人们更增加了对这场球赛的兴趣和热情。拉文克劳与赫奇帕奇非常关心比赛结果，因为他们来年要跟这两个队较量。两个学院的院长虽然表面装出洒脱的风度，却暗下决心要看到已方取胜。哈利看出麦格教授是多么希望他们打败斯莱特林，她在比赛前一星期免除了他们的家庭作业。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Snape was no less obviously partisan; he had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eye-witnesses who insisted they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯内普的偏向也明摆着：他老是为斯莱特林预租球场，使得格兰芬多队很难找到场地训练。他还对多起斯莱特林学生企图在走廊里用魔法坑害格兰芬多球员的报告置若罔闻。当艾丽娅·斯平内特眉毛长得挡住了眼睛和嘴巴、被送进校医院时，斯内普一口咬定是她自己用了生发咒，而不肯听十四个目击者的证词，他们明明看到斯莱特林队守门员迈尔斯·布莱奇在图书馆里从背后对她施了魔法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你们这一段够忙的了。”她高傲地说，大家都不敢相信自己的耳朵，直到她望着哈利和罗恩严肃地说，“同学们，我已经看惯了魁地奇杯摆在我书房里，实在不想把它交给斯内普教授，所以请用这多出的时间训练，行不行？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindors chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy's team. Admittedly, Ron was still not performing to Wood's standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence after he'd made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form; during one memorable practice he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goalhoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the centre hoop at the other end; the rest of the team felt this save compared favourably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland's top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting he was related to them, something they assured him they had been trying to deny for four years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利对格兰芬多队感到乐观，毕竟，他们以前从未输给过马尔福的球队。不可否认，罗恩的球技还没达到伍德的水平，但他正在刻苦提高。他最大的弱点是犯了错误就会失去信心，一个球没守住，他就会心烦意乱，结果丢球更多。但是，哈利也见过罗恩状态好时真正精彩的救球：在一次难忘的训练中，他单手吊在扫帚上，把鬼飞球从球门柱边大力踢开，使它一直飞到球场另一端，穿过了对方球门中间的圆环。其他队员都认为这个救球可与前不久爱尔兰世界级守门员巴里·瑞安对波兰最好的追球手拉迪斯洛·扎莫斯基的那一球相媲美。连弗雷德都说罗恩也许还会让他和乔治感到自豪，他们在认真地考虑承认和他有亲戚关系，他告诉罗恩他们四年来一直想否认这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got on to the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide comments for over four years, so whispers of, "Hey, Potty, I heard Warrington's sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday', far from chilling his blood, made him laugh. "Warrington's aim's so pathetic I'd be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me," he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="惟一真正让哈利担心的是，罗恩在进球之前就让斯莱克林队的战术搞慌了。哈利当然已经听惯了他们吹了四年多的牛皮，所以像“嘿，波特，我听到沃林顿发誓说星期六要把你从扫帚上撞下去”这样的话根本不会让他胆战心惊，只会让他笑笑而已。“沃林顿的准头那么差，如果他要撞的是我旁边那个人，我会更担心一些。”他的反驳让罗恩和赫敏哈哈大笑，潘西·帕金森脸上得意的笑容消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers and intimidation. When Slytherins, some of them seventh-years and considerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, "Got your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?" he didn't laugh, but turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they came within sight of each other), Ron's ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但罗恩没有经受过这种侮辱、讥讽和恫吓的无情攻势。当一些斯莱特林的学生（其中有比他大得多的七年级学生）在走廊里低声说：“在校医院订好床位了吗，韦斯莱？”他没有笑，而是脸色发绿。当德拉科·马尔福模仿罗恩漏接鬼飞球（每当他们见面时，他都会这么做）时，罗恩耳根通红，双手发抖，手上拿着什么都会掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy draughts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly grey, the mountains around Hogwarts were snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle dropped so low that many students wore their thick protective dragonskin gloves in the corridors between lessons.</div>

Harry looked round and saw that, in addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats, every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown. For some reason many of them waved at Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, Mr. Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick," said Umbridge, her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said. "You and Mr. Weasley here. And I think, to be safe, this young man's twin ought to be stopped, too -- if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to make sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable, Professor McGonagall," she continued, turning back to Professor McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice, staring at her. "The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them. Well… good afternoon to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，波特先生，我想终身禁赛比较合适，”乌姆里奇说，看到他艰难地试图理解她的话，她笑得更开心了，“你和韦斯莱先生。我想，为了安全起见，这位小伙子的双胞胎兄弟也应被禁止——如果他的队员没有拦住他的话，我相信他也会袭击马尔福先生的。我要没收他们的飞天扫帚，把它们安全地保管在我的办公室里，以确保没人违反我的禁令。但我并非不讲情理，麦格教授，”她转身对像冰雕一般瞪着她的麦格教授说，“其他队员可以继续打球，我没看见他们有暴力倾向。好了…祝你们下午好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
