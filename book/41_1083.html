<div class="line_en">This evening, I come home from the clinic and find a message from Thalia on the landline phone in my bedroom. I play it as I slip off my shoes and sit at my desk. She tells me she has a cold, one she is sure she picked up from Mamá, then she asks after me, asks how work is going in Kabul. At the end, just before she hangs up, she says, Odie goes on and on about how you don't call. Of course she won't tell you. So I will. Markos. For the love of Christ. Call your mother. You ass.</div>

<div class="line_en">I turn on my laptop and start typing up the previous day's op notes. My room is upstairs -- one of three bedrooms on the second floor of this house where I have lived since my arrival in Kabul back in 2002-- and my desk sits at the window overlooking the garden below. I have a view of the loquat trees my old landlord, Nabi, and I planted a few years ago. I can see Nabi's onetime quarters along the back wall too, now repainted. After he passed away, I offered them to a young Dutch fellow who helps local high schools with their IT. And, off to the right, there is Suleiman Wahdati's 1940s Chevrolet, unmoved for decades, shrouded in rust like a rock by moss, currently covered by a light film of yesterday's surprisingly early snowfall, the first of the year thus far. After Nabi died, I thought briefly of having the car hauled to one of Kabul's junkyards, but I didn't have the heart. It seemed to me too essential a part of the house's past, its history.</div>

<div class="line_en">I met Thalia in the summer of 1967, when I was twelve years old. She and her mother, Madaline, came to Tinos to visit Mamá and me. Mamá, whose name is Odelia, said it had been years -- fifteen, to be exact -- since she and her friend Madaline had last seen each other. Madaline had left the island at seventeen and gone off to Athens to become, for a brief time at least, an actress of some modest renown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是1967年的夏天见到萨丽娅的，当时我十二岁。她和她母亲玛达丽娜来蒂诺斯看妈妈和我。妈妈名叫奥德丽娅，她说，自从她和她朋友玛达丽娜上次见面，已经过去了很多个年头，确切地说，有十五年了。玛达丽娜十七岁离岛而去，前往雅典，至少在短期之内，成了个小有名气的女演员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I am going to call Mamá tonight, I can't delay it any longer. I remember Thalia wrote in one of her e-mails that Mamá was going to bed earlier and earlier. I take a breath and steel myself. I pick up the receiver and dial.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Madaline and I met at mass, when we were little," Mamá said. Right off, she said, they had become inseparable friends. They had held hands under their desks in class, or at recess, at church, or strolling past the barley fields. They had sworn to remain sisters for life. They promised they would live close to each other, even after they'd married. They would live as neighbors, and if one or the other's husband insisted on moving away, then they would demand a divorce. I remember that Mamá grinned a little when she told me all this self-mockingly, as if to distance herself from this youthful exuberance and foolishness, all those headlong, breathless vows. But I saw on her face a tinge of unspoken hurt as well, a shade of disappointment that Mamá was far too proud to admit to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“玛达丽娜和我是在做弥撒的时候认识的。”妈妈说，“那时我们还小。”她说她们一下子就成了形影不离的好朋友。上课时，她们在课桌底下手拉着手，课间休息时，上教堂时，漫步走过大麦地的时候，也总是牵着手。她们曾经立下誓言，一辈子以姐妹相认。她们保证要彼此亲近，哪怕将来嫁了人。她们要比邻而居，如果一个或另一个的丈夫非要搬走，那么她们便提出离婚。我记得妈妈告诉我这些事的时候，是撇着嘴，笑着说的，一副自嘲的神情，好像要让自己远离这种少女时代的多愁善感和愚蠢的言行，与所有那些轻率的、寻死觅活的山盟海誓拉开距离。可我也从她脸上看到了少许不言而喻的痛楚，一道失望的阴影，只是妈妈的自尊心过于强烈，让她无法承认这样的失望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mamá wouldn't say more, and I knew better than to lean on her about it. But this revelation intrigued me far more than Madaline's past in film and stage had, my curiosity fueled by the suspicion that the scar must be both significant and visible for the girl to deserve special consideration. With morbid eagerness, I looked forward to seeing this scar for myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈没有再多说什么，但是我明白，还是别缠着她问来问去为妙。可她这么一说，反倒勾起了我的胃口，连玛达丽娜在电影和舞台上的过去也不那么关心了。我之所以好奇，是因为我猜，那个疤对一个女孩子来说，肯定既不同寻常又引人注目，所以才值得特别对待。我带着一种病态的渴望，盼着亲眼见识一下那个疤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Madaline was married now to a wealthy and much older man, a Mr. Andreas Gianakos, who years before had produced her second and, as it turned out, last film. He was in the construction business now and owned a big firm in Athens. They had had a falling-out recently, a row, Madaline and Mr. Gianakos. Mamá didn't tell me any of this information; I knew it from a clandestine, hasty, partial read of the letter Madaline had sent Mamá informing her of her intent to visit.</div>

<div class="line_en">It grows so tiresome, I tell you, to be around Andreas and his right-wing friends and their martial music. I keep tight-lipped all the time. I say nothing when they exalt these military thugs who have made a mockery of our democracy. Should I utter so much as a word of dissent, I am confident they would label me a communist anarchist, and then even Andreas's influence would not save me from the dungeons. Perhaps he would not bother exerting it, meaning his influence. Sometimes I believe it is precisely his intent to provoke me into impugning myself. Ah, how I miss you, my dear Odie. How I miss your company…</div>

<div class="line_en">The day our guests were due to arrive, Mamá awoke early to tidy up. We lived in a small house built into a hillside. Like many houses on Tinos, it was made of whitewashed stone, and the roof was flat, with diamond-shaped red tiles. The small upstairs bedroom Mamá and I shared didn't have a door -- the narrow stairwell led right into it -- but it did have a fanlight window and a narrow terrace with a waist-high wrought-iron balustrade from which you could look out on the roofs of other houses, on the olive trees and the goats and winding stone alleys and arches below, and, of course, the Aegean, blue and calm in the summer morning, white-capped in the afternoon when the meltemi winds blew in from the north.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按照预定的日期，我们的客人将要抵达的那天，妈妈早早就起了床，收拾家里。我们住的是一幢建在山坡上的小房子。和蒂诺斯的许多房子一样，它是用刷成白色的石头盖成的，房顶是平的，铺着菱形的红瓦。小卧室在楼上，妈妈与我合住，没有门，狭窄的楼梯井直接通到屋里，可是它有个扇形气窗，一个很窄的阳台，围着齐腰高的熟铁护栏，由此外望，你可以看到别人家的屋顶，下面是橄榄树，羊群，蜿蜒的石巷和拱门，当然还有爱琴海，在夏日的早晨蔚蓝而平静，到了下午，美尔忒弥[1]风从北方吹来，海上就会泛起白浪。【注：[1]美尔忒弥（Meltemi）是地中海季风在希腊和土耳其的名字。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she was done cleaning up, Mamá put on what passed for her one fancy outfit, the one she wore every August fifteenth, the Feast of the Dormition at the Panagia Evangelistria Church, when pilgrims descended on Tinos from everywhere in the Mediterranean to pray before the church's famed icon. There is a photo of my mother in that outfit -- the long, drab rusty gold dress with a rounded neckline, the shrunken white sweater, the stockings, the clunky black shoes. Mamá looking every bit the forbidding widow, with her severe face, her tufted eyebrows, and her snub nose, standing stiffly, looking sullenly pious, like she's a pilgrim herself. I'm in the picture too, standing rigidly at my mother's hip. I am wearing a white shirt, white shorts, and white kneesocks rolled up. You can tell by my scowl that I've been ordered to stand straight, to not smile, that my face has been scrubbed and my hair combed down with water, against my will and with a great deal of fuss. You can sense a current of dissatisfaction between us. You see it in how rigidly we stand, how our bodies barely make contact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="做完清洁，妈妈换上了她心目中的花哨行头，每年的八月十五日她都会穿上这身衣服，去帕纳伊亚[2]福音教堂，那一天是圣母升天节，朝圣者们从地中海各地蜂拥到蒂诺斯，到教堂著名的圣像前祷告。有一张照片是我母亲穿着这身衣服拍的，长长的、死气沉沉的锈金色圆领裙，皱缩的白毛衣，长袜，笨重的黑鞋子。从头到脚，妈妈都像是个令人生畏的寡妇，严肃的脸，浓密的眉毛，扁而上翘的鼻子，僵硬的站姿，一副苦闷而虔诚的模样，好像她自己也是个朝圣者。我也在照片上，直挺挺地站在我母亲屁股旁边。我穿着白衬衫，白短裤，卷起来的白色及膝短袜。你能看出我愁眉紧锁，因为她勒令我站直，不许笑，我的脸搓洗过了，头发也蘸着水梳过，我不乐意，还折腾了好一阵子。你可以感觉到我俩之间的那种不悦。你能看得出来，因为我们僵硬地站着，身体几乎没有接触。【注：[2]帕纳伊亚（Panagia）是东正教对圣母马利亚的敬称之一。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From the bedroom window upstairs, I watched Mamá leave for the ferry port in the town of Tinos. A scarf tied under the chin, Mamá rammed into the sunny blue day headfirst. She was a slight, small-boned woman with the body of a child, but when you saw her coming you did well to let her pass. I remember her walking me to school every morning -- my mother is retired now, but she was a schoolteacher. As we walked, Mamá never held my hand. The other mothers did with their own kids, but not Mamá. She said she had to treat me like any other student. She marched ahead, a fist closed at the neck of her sweater, and I tried to keep up, lunch box in hand, tottering along behind in her footsteps. In the classroom, I always sat at the back. I remember my mother at the blackboard and how she could nail a misbehaving pupil with a single, scalding glance, like a rock from a slingshot, the aim surgically true. And she could cleave you in half with nothing but a dark look or a sudden beat of silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过楼上卧室的窗户，我看到妈妈出了门，走向蒂诺斯城的渡口。她下巴底下系着围巾，一头扎进了阳光灿烂的蓝天。她是个纤细的女人，一副小骨头架子，儿童般的身体，可你要是看到她迎面过来，那你最好给她让个道。我记得她每天早晨送我上学时的情形——我母亲现在退休了，她原来是个老师。我们走在路上，妈妈从来不牵我的手。别的母亲都和自己的孩子手拉着手，可妈妈不。她说她怎样对待别的学生，也就必须怎样对待我。她迈着大步走在前头，一只手紧攥着，贴在毛衣领子的位置上，我拼命跟在后面，手里提着午餐盒，追着她的脚步，一路踉跄。在教室里，我总是坐在后排。我记得我母亲站在黑板前的样子，记得她怎样只需刀子般的一瞥，便可牢牢钉死某个淘气的学生，那眼神就像弹弓里射出的石子，带着外科手术般的精确，一下子击中目标。她还能把你活活劈成两半，不靠别的，只要一黑脸，或是一阵突如其来的沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I fell asleep upstairs a short while after Mamá left. I jolted awake later to a woman's high, ringing voice. I sat up and there she was, all lipstick, powder, perfume, and slender curves, an airline ad smiling down at me through the thin veil of a pillbox hat. She stood in the middle of the room in a neon green minidress, leather valise at her feet, with her auburn hair and long limbs, grinning down at me, a shine on her face, and talking, the seams of her voice bursting with aplomb and cheer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mamá believed in loyalty above all, even at the cost of self-denial. Especially at the cost of self-denial. She also believed it was always best to tell the truth, to tell it plainly, without fanfare, and the more disagreeable the truth, the sooner you had to tell it. She had no patience for soft spines. She was -- is -- a woman of enormous will, a woman without apology, and not a woman with whom you want to have a dispute -- though I have never really understood, even now, whether her temperament was God-given or one she adopted out of necessity, what with her husband dying barely a year into their marriage and leaving her to raise me all on her own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈信奉忠诚甚于一切，哪怕要自我牺牲也在所不辞。尤其是在所不辞的自我牺牲。她还相信讲出真相总是胜过一切，老老实实地讲，一句客套话都不说，而且真相越令人不快，就越要早早地讲出来。她受不了软骨头。她过去是，现在也是个有着钢铁意志的女人，一个从不退缩的女人，也是一个你绝不想和她争执的女人，但我从没有真正地理解，甚至现在也没弄懂，她这种性格到底是天生的，还是出于必要而后天习得的，因为她结婚才一年，丈夫就死了，撇下她一个人把我拉扯大。">查看中文翻译</div>

She had to yank on each fingertip a bunch of times before the glove came off, and then she stooped slightly at the waist and offered me her hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stood at the entrance of the room beside my mother, looking at me blankly, a lanky, pale-skinned girl with limp curls. Other than that, I can't tell you a single thing. I can't tell you the color of the dress she wore that day -- that is, if she wore a dress -- or the style of her shoes, or whether she had socks on, or whether she wore a watch, or a necklace, or a ring, or a pair of earrings. I can't tell you because if you were at a restaurant and someone suddenly stripped, hopped atop a table, and started juggling dessert spoons, you would not only look, it would be the only thing you could look at.

<div class="line_en">"Hello," I replied with a sandpaper tongue. There was a ripple in the air. A current. I felt charged with something that was half thrill, half dread, something that burst upward inside of me and coiled itself up. I was staring and I knew it and I couldn't stop, couldn't peel my gaze away from the sky blue cloth of the mask, the two sets of bands tying it to the back of her head, the narrow horizontal slit over the mouth. I knew right then that I couldn't bear to see it, whatever the mask was hiding. And that I couldn't wait to see it. Nothing in my life could resume its natural course and rhythm and order until I saw for myself what was so terrible, so dreadful, that I and others had to be protected from it.</div>

Madaline smoking, standing at the bedroom window, looking at the sea through a set of teashade glasses with yellow lenses, one hand on her hip, ankles crossed. Her pillbox hat sits on the dresser. Above the dresser is a mirror and in the mirror is Thalia, sitting on the edge of the bed, her back to me. She is stooped down, doing something, maybe undoing her shoelaces, and I can see that she has removed her mask. It's sitting next to her on the bed. A thread of cold marches down my spine and I try to stop it, but my hands tremble, which makes the porcelain cup clink on the saucer, which makes Madaline turn her head from the window to me, which makes Thalia look up.

<div class="line_en">I switch the receiver to my other ear. It surprises me that she remembers. All my life, I have had the feeling that the words I say to Mamá vanish unheard in space, as if there is static between us, a bad connection. Sometimes when I call her from Kabul, as I have now, I feel as though she has quietly lowered the receiver and stepped away, that I am speaking into a void across the continents -- though I can feel my mother's presence on the line and hear her breathing in my ear. Other times, I am telling her about something I saw at the clinic -- some bloodied boy carried by his father, for instance, shrapnel embedded deep in his cheeks, ear torn clean off, another victim of playing on the wrong street at the wrong time of the wrong day -- and then, without warning, a loud clunk, and Mamá's voice suddenly distant and muffled, rising and falling, the echo of footsteps, of something being dragged across the floor, and I clam up, wait until she comes back on, which she does eventually, always a bit out of breath, explaining, I told her I was fine standing up. I said it clearly. I said, "Thalia, I would like to stand at the window and look down on the water as I'm talking to Markos." But she says, "You'll tire yourself out, Odie, you need to sit." Next thing I know, she's dragging the armchair -- this big leather thing she bought me last year -- she's dragging it to the window. My God, she's strong. You haven't seen the armchair, of course. Well, of course. She then sighs with mock exasperation and asks that I go on with my story, but by then I am too unbalanced to. The net effect is that she has made me feel vaguely reprimanded and, what's more, deserving of it, guilty of wrongs unspoken, offenses I've never been formally charged with. Even if I do go on with my story, it sounds diminished to my own ears. It does not measure up to Mamá's armchair drama with Thalia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把听筒换到另一边的耳朵上。我很吃惊，她还记得。我一辈子都有种感觉，我对妈妈说的话她是听不见的，统统消失在太空里了，好像我们之间有静电干扰，线路很差。有时我从喀布尔打电话给她，就像现在这次，我感觉她好像悄悄把听筒放下，人走掉了，剩下我对着另一块大陆上的空气说话，就算我能感到我母亲在电话线另一头的存在，就算我听得到她在我耳边喘息，也还是这种感觉。其他时间，我会给她讲一些我在医院的见闻——比如说，有个父亲抱来个血肉模糊的男孩，弹片深深嵌在他脸上，一只耳朵完全撕掉了，这是又一个受害者，他在错误的日子和错误的时段，在错误的街道上玩——毫无预兆地突然出现一记巨大的敲击声，然后妈妈的声音突然远了，听不清了，忽高忽低，脚步回响，有什么东西在地板上拖过来，我默不作声，一直等到她回来，她早晚会回来的，有点儿上气不接下气，解释着：我跟她说过了，我站着挺好的。我说得很清楚。我说：“萨丽娅，我愿意站在窗户前，看着下面的海，和马科斯说话。”可是她说：“你会累着自己的，奥蒂，你得坐下。”接下来的事我知道，她要拖扶手椅了——那个大大的皮家伙，去年她给我买的——她要把它拖到窗户跟前。我的天，她可真壮实。你没见过这椅子，当然没有。就是，当然没有。然后她带着佯怒，叹一口气，要我继续讲我的故事，可是到了这会儿，我已经心乱如麻，哪里还讲得下去。最终的效果是，她让我感觉自己受到了不言而喻的谴责，不仅如此，她还让我感觉自己活该受到这种谴责，让我感到内疚，因为心照不宣的过错，因为那些从未受到正式控告的罪行。即使我真的把故事讲下去，在我自己听来，它也没什么劲了。它根本比不上妈妈和萨丽娅的扶手椅大戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pari Wahdati stayed a week with me at the house in Kabul. I gave her a tour of it when she arrived from Paris. She had last seen the house back in 1955 and seemed quite surprised at the vividness of her own memory of the place, its general layout, the two steps between the living room and dining room, for instance, where she said she would sit in a band of sunlight midmornings and read her books. She was struck by how much smaller the house really was compared to the version of it in her memory. When I took her upstairs, she knew which had been her bedroom, though it's currently taken up by a German colleague of mine who works for the World Food Program. I remember her breath catching when she spotted the short little armoire in the corner of the bedroom -- one of the few surviving relics of her childhood. I remembered it from the note that Nabi had left me prior to his death. She squatted next to it and ran her fingertips over the chipped yellow paint and over the fading giraffes and long-tailed monkeys on its doors. When she looked up at me, I saw that her eyes had teared a little, and she asked, very shyly and apologetically, if it would be possible to have it shipped to Paris. She offered to pay for a replacement. It was the only thing she wanted from the house. I told her it would be my pleasure to do it.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was like waking up one morning and finding that a wild animal has wandered into your house. No place felt safe to me. She was there at every corner and turn, prowling, stalking, forever dabbing at her cheek with a handkerchief to dry the dribble that constantly flowed from her mouth. The small dimensions of our house rendered escape from her impossible. I especially dreaded mealtime when I had to endure the spectacle of Thalia lifting the bottom of the mask to deliver spoonfuls of food to her mouth. My stomach turned at the sight and at the sound. She ate noisily, bits of half-chewed food always falling with a wet splat onto her plate, or the table, or even the floor. She was forced to take all liquids, even soup, through a straw, of which her mother kept a stash in her purse. She slurped and gurgled when she sucked broth up the straw, and it always stained the mask and dripped down the side of her jaw onto her neck. The first time, I asked to be excused from the table, and Mamá shot me a hard look. And so I trained myself to avert my gaze and not hear, but it wasn't easy. I would walk into the kitchen and there she would be, sitting still while Madaline rubbed ointment onto her cheek to prevent chafing. I began keeping a calendar, a mental countdown, of the four weeks Mamá had said Madaline and Thalia were staying.</div>

<div class="line_en">Madaline's stories stirred up an old restlessness in me, an urge I'd always had to strike out headlong into the world, to be dauntless. By comparison, my own life on Tinos seemed crushingly ordinary. I foresaw my life unfolding as an interminable stretch of nothingness and so I spent most of my childhood years on Tinos floundering, feeling like a stand-in for myself, a proxy, as though my real self resided elsewhere, waiting to unite someday with this dimmer, more hollow self. I felt marooned. An exile in my own home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛达丽娜的故事唤醒了我心里长久以来的躁动。我总有一种强烈的欲望，想冲出家门，闯荡世界，勇往直前。相形之下，我在蒂诺斯的生活就显得过于平凡。我预见到自己的人生慢慢展开，不过是一片虚无，没完没了地向外延展，所以我干脆把自己在蒂诺斯度过的大部分童年岁月付诸蹉跎，我感到我是自己的一个替身，一个代理，仿佛那个真正的自我在别处栖息，等待着有朝一日，能与这个晦暗、空洞的自我复合。我觉得我是孤岛上的逃奴，自己家里的流亡者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wished Madaline had come by herself. I liked Madaline just fine. We sat, the four of us, in the small square-shaped courtyard outside our front door, and she sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes one after the other, the angles of her face shaded by our olive tree and a gold straw cloche that should have looked absurd on her, would have on anyone else -- like Mamá, for instance. But Madaline was one of those people to whom elegance came effortlessly as though it were a genetic skill, like the ability to curl your tongue into the shape of a tube. With Madaline, there was never a lull in the conversation; stories just trilled out of her. One morning she told us about her travels -- to Ankara, for instance, where she had strolled the banks of the Enguri Su and sipped green tea laced with raki, or the time she and Mr. Gianakos had gone to Kenya and ridden the backs of elephants among thorny acacias and even sat down to eat cornmeal mush and coconut rice with the local villagers.</div>

They may come with a bit of charm -- or a lot -- and that can fool you. But really they're all unhappy little boys sloshing around in their own rage. They feel wronged. They haven't been given their due. No one loved them enough. Of course they expect you to love them. They want to be held, rocked, reassured. But it's a mistake to give it to them.

<div class="line_en">Later, when I was older, it wasn't as clear to me. Thinking back on it, there was something affected about the way she paused when she mentioned the first husband, the casting down of the gaze, the catch in the throat, the slight quiver of lips, just as there was about the walloping energy and the joking, the lively, heavy-footed charm, the way even her slights landed softly, parachuted by a reassuring wink and laugh. Perhaps they were both trumped-up affectations or perhaps neither was. It became a blur for me what was performance and what real -- which at least made me think of her as an infinitely more interesting actress.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she mentioned the first husband, I noticed that, for the first time since I had met her, a shadow had settled on her face, a momentary intimation of something dark and chastening, wounding, at odds with the energetic laughs and the teasing and the loose pumpkin floral dress she was wearing. I remember thinking at the time what a good actress she must be to camouflage disappointment and hurt with a veneer of cheerfulness. Like a mask, I thought, and was privately pleased with myself for the clever connection.</div>

I made sure to walk a few steps ahead so passersby -- or, God forbid, one of the boys from school -- wouldn't think we were together, which, of course, they would anyway. Anyone could see. At the least, I hoped the distance between us would signal my displeasure and reluctance. To my relief, she didn't make an effort to keep up.

A pelican hovered over the blue-green water, its wings spread. Two ladies stood side by side, knee-deep in the water, their skirts held up high. To the west, I had a view of the island, the dominant white of the homes and windmills, the green of the barley fields, the dull brown of the jagged mountains from which springs flowed every year. My father died on one of those mountains. He worked for a green-marble quarry and one day, when Mamá was six months pregnant with me, he slipped off a cliff and fell a hundred feet. Mamá said he'd forgotten to secure his safety harness.</div>

The rope that pulls you from the flood can become a noose around your neck. People always disappoint Mamá in the end, me included.

There wasn't much in the way of a tourist industry on Tinos in those days. It was a farming island, really, people living off their cows and goats and olive trees and wheat.

<div class="line_en">About a month back, I had spotted a camera in his display window, sitting on its worn rust-colored leather case. Every few days, I strolled over to the shop, stared at this camera, and imagined myself in India, the leather case hanging by the strap over my shoulder, taking photos of the paddies and tea estates I had seen in National Geographic. I would shoot the Inca Trail. On camelback, in some dust-choked old truck, or on foot, I would brave the heat until I stood gazing up at the Sphinx and the Pyramids, and I would shoot them too and see my photos published in magazines with glossy pages. This was what drew me to Mr. Roussos's window that morning -- though the shop was closed for the day -- to stand outside, my forehead pressed to the glass, and daydream.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, I wandered off toward town. We lived on the southwestern shore of the island, and Tinos town was only a few miles' walk south. There was a little knickknack shop there run by a heavy-faced widower named Mr. Roussos. On any given day, you were apt to find in the window of his shop anything from a 1940s typewriter to a pair of leather work boots, or a weathervane, an old plant stand, giant wax candles, a cross, or, of course, copies of the Panagia Evangelistria icon.

<div class="line_en">Thalia sat on the sidewalk and pulled her skirt over her knees. It was a hot day, the sun biting the skin like it had teeth. Hardly anyone was out and about except for an elderly couple trudging stiffly up the street. The husband -- Demis something -- wore a gray flat cap and a brown tweed jacket that looked too heavy for the season. He had a frozen, wide-eyed look to his face, I remember, the way some old people do, like they are perpetually startled by the monstrous surprise that is old age -- it wasn't until years later, in medical school, that I suspected he had Parkinson's. They waved as they passed and I waved back. I saw them take notice of Thalia, a momentary pause in their stride, and then they moved on.</div>

I couldn't hear what she was saying but I could tell that she was speaking more slowly than before, enunciating well, and I pictured her leaning forward, elbows on knees, making eye contact, not blinking. Over the years, I have come to know this tone of voice intimately. When people speak this way, they're likely disclosing, revealing, confessing some catastrophe, beseeching the listener. It's a staple of the military's casualty notification teams knocking on doors, lawyers touting the merits of plea deals to clients, policemen stopping cars at 3 A. M., cheating husbands.

Mamá can't stand it when people cry in her presence. She can barely look at their puffy eyes, their open, pleading faces. She sees crying as a sign of weakness, a garish appeal for attention, and she won't indulge it. She can't bring herself to console. Growing up, I learned that it was not one of her strong suits. Sorrow ought to be private, she thinks, not flaunted. Once, when I was little, I asked her if she'd cried when my father had fallen to his death.</div>

<div class="line_en">I like being behind the lens better, I say. It's true. I have taken hundreds of pictures, and you won't find me in any. I always order two sets of prints when I drop off the film. I keep one set, mail the other to Thalia back home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喜欢待在镜头后面。我说。这是实话。我已经拍了几百张照片，哪一张里你都找不到我。取出胶卷时，我总是洗印两套照片，我留一套，另一套给萨丽娅寄回家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gianna asks how I finance my trips and I explain I pay for them with inheritance money. This is partially true, because the inheritance is Thalia's, not mine. Unlike Madaline, who for obvious reasons was never mentioned in Andreas's will, Thalia was. She gave me half her money. I am supposed to be putting myself through university with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹娜问我旅行的钱从哪儿来的，我说我用了遗产的钱。这不全是事实，因为遗产是萨丽娅的，不是我的。与玛达丽娜不一样，出于显而易见的原因，安德烈亚斯的遗嘱里根本没有提到她，只有萨丽娅。她把一半钱给了我。我本该用这钱把大学念完。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gianna props herself up on her elbows and leans across the bed, over me, her small breasts brushing my skin. She fetches her pack, lights a cigarette. I'd met her the day before at Piazza di Spagna. I was sitting on the stone steps that connect the square below to the church on the hill. She walked up and said something to me in Italian. She looked like so many of the pretty, seemingly aimless girls I'd seen slinking around Rome's churches and piazzas. They smoked and talked loudly and laughed a lot. I shook my head and said, Sorry? She smiled, went Ah, and then, in heavily accented English, said, Lighter? Cigarette. I shook my head and told her in my own heavily accented English that I didn't smoke. She grinned. Her eyes were bright and jumping. The late-morning sun made a nimbus around her diamond-shaped face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹娜用胳膊肘撑起身体，越过我，横到床的另一头，小乳房擦着我的皮肤。她拿了烟盒，点了支香烟。我是前一天在西班牙广场遇见她的。当时我坐在通往广场的石头台阶上，再往上便是山上的教堂[6]。她走上来，用意大利语对我说了句什么。我见过太多像她这样的漂亮姑娘，在罗马的教堂和广场附近，似乎漫无目的地游荡。她们抽烟，大声说话，动不动就放声大笑。我摇了摇头，说：什么？她笑了笑，蹦出个噢，接着用口音很重的英语说：打火机？烟。我摇摇头，也用口音很重的英语告诉她，我不吸烟。她咧嘴一笑。她眼睛亮亮的，眼神飘忽不定。午前的阳光照着她钻石形的脸，映出了一圈神像般的光环。【注：[6]西班牙广场（Piazza di Spagna），经西班牙阶梯，通往山上的圣三一教堂。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About midway through our trek back to the bus stop, I realize I've lost the photo. I tell them I need to go back. There is no choice, I have to go back. Alfonso, a wiry, tight-lipped huaso who is tagging along as our informal Chilean guide, looks questioningly at Gary. Gary is an American. He is the alpha male in our trio. He has dirty-blond hair and acne pits on his cheeks. It's a face that hints at habitual hard living. Gary is in a foul mood, made worse by hunger, the absence of alcohol, and the nasty rash on his right calf, which he contracted brushing up against a litre shrub the day before. I'd met them both at a crowded bar in Santiago, where, after half a dozen rounds of piscolas, Alfonso had suggested a hike to the waterfall at Salto del Apoquindo, where his father used to take him when he was a boy. We'd made the hike the next day and had camped out at the waterfall for the night. We'd smoked dope, the water roaring in our ears, a wide-open sky crammed with stars above us. We were trudging back now toward San Carlos de Apoquindo to catch the bus.</div>

Gary adjusts the straps of his knapsack, and the two of them head back up the trail along the folds of the mountain, Gary waving once without looking as they take a hairpin turn. I walk back the way we had come. It takes me four hours, actually, because I do get lost as Gary had predicted. I am exhausted by the time I reach the campsite. I search all over, kicking bushes, looking between rocks, dread building as I rummage in vain. Then, just as I try to resign myself to the worst, I spot a flash of white in a batch of shrubs up a shallow slope. I find the photo wedged between a tangle of brambles. I pluck it free, beat dust from it, my eyes brimming with tears of relief.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Caracas I sleep under a bridge. A youth hostel in Brussels. Sometimes I splurge and rent a room in a nice hotel, take long hot showers, shave, eat meals in a bathrobe. I watch color TV. The cities, the roads, the countryside, the people I meet -- they all begin to blur. I tell myself I am searching for something.

My skin is the yellow of a sari, and it feels like invisible hands are peeling it raw. When I can't walk anymore, I lie down on the side of the road. An old man across the road stirs something in a big steel pot. Beside him is a cage, inside the cage a blue-and-red parrot. A dark-skinned vendor pushing a cartful of empty green bottles passes me by. That's the last thing I remember.</div>

Thalia, her hair flapping in the breeze, the water bubbling with froth around her, her bare feet on the rocks, the leaping Aegean flung out before her. A lump rises to my throat.

I sleep a lot. When I don't, I itch. I take the pills they give me and the pills make me sleep again. Otherwise, I look down at the bustling street outside the dormitory, at the sunlight skidding over tent bazaars and back-alley tea shops. I watch the kids shooting marbles on sidewalks that melt into muddy gutters, the old women sitting in doorways, the street vendors in dhotis squatting on their mats, scraping coconuts, hawking marigold garlands.

This morning, one of the nurses, not Gul, is trying to feed him pills, but the boy turns his head side to side, his throat making a sound like a scraping against wood. Finally, the nurse pries his mouth open, forces the pills inside. When he leaves, the boy rolls his head slowly toward me. We eye each other across the space between our beds.

<div class="line_en">I learn that the boy's name is Manaar. It means "guiding light." His mother was a prostitute, his father a thief. He lived with his aunt and uncle, who beat him. No one knows exactly what is killing him, only that it is. No one visits him, and when he dies, a week from now -- a month, two at the outside -- no one will come to claim him. No one will grieve. No one will remember. He will die where he lived, in the cracks. When he sleeps, I find myself looking at him, at his cratered temples, the head that's too big for his shoulders, the pigmented scar on his lower lip where, Gul informed me, his mother's pimp had the habit of putting out his cigarette. I try speaking to him in English, then in the few Urdu words I know, but he only blinks tiredly. Sometimes I put my hands together and make shadow animals on the wall to win a smile from him.</div>

I follow his finger, raise my head, but I see nothing but the blue wisp of sky through the clouds, children below playing with water gushing from a street pump, a bus spewing exhaust. Then I realize he is pointing at the photo of Thalia. I pluck it from the window and hand it to him. He holds it close to his face, by the burnt corner, and stares at it for a long time. I wonder if it is the ocean that draws him. I wonder if he's ever tasted salt water or got dizzy watching the tide pull away from his feet. Or perhaps, though he can't see her face, he senses a kin in Thalia, someone who knows what pain feels like. He goes to hand the photo back to me. I shake my head. Hold on to it, I say. A shadow of mistrust crosses his face. I smile. And, I cannot be sure, but I think he smiles back.</div>

Every morning I carry Manaar into it, holding his naked body in my arms, careful not to bounce him -- I'd watched one of the volunteers carry him before over the shoulder as if he were a bag of rice. I gently lower him onto the bench and wait for him to catch his breath. I rinse his small, frail body with warm water. Manaar always sits quietly, patiently, palms on his knees, head hung low. He is like a fearful, bony old man. I run the soapy sponge over his rib cage, the knobs of his spine, over shoulder blades that jut out like shark fins.

<div class="line_en">I go for long, aimless walks around the city, if only to get away from the hospital, the collective breaths of the sick and dying. I walk in dusty sunsets through streets lined with graffiti-stained walls, past tin-shed stalls packed tightly against one another, crossing paths with little girls carrying basketfuls of raw dung on their head, women covered in black soot boiling rags in huge aluminum vats. I think a lot about Manaar as I meander down a cat's cradle of narrow alleyways, Manaar waiting to die in that room full of broken figures like him. I think a lot about Thalia, sitting on the rock, looking out at the sea. I sense something deep inside me drawing me in, tugging at me like an undertow. I want to give in to it, be seized by it. I want to give up my bearings, slip out of who I am, shed everything, the way a snake discards old skin.</div>

I stumble around the world for still another year before I finally find myself at a corner desk in an Athens library, looking down at a medical school application. In between Manaar and the application are the two weeks I spent in Damascus, of which I have virtually no memory other than the grinning faces of two women with heavily lined eyes and a gold tooth each. Or the three months in Cairo in the basement of a ramshackle tenement run by a hashish-addicted landlord. I spend Thalia's money riding buses in Iceland, tagging along with a punk band in Munich. In 1977, I break an elbow at an antinuclear protest in Bilbao.</div>

She said she would send us postcards and letters, and pictures of the film set. She said more, but I didn't hear much of it. What I was feeling was enormous relief and outright giddiness. My dread of the coming end of summer was like a knot in my belly, winding tighter with each passing day as I steeled myself against the approaching farewell. I woke every morning now eager to see Thalia at the breakfast table, to hear the bizarre sound of her voice. We barely ate before we were out climbing trees, chasing each other through the barley fields, plowing through the stalks and letting out war cries, lizards scattering away from our feet. We stashed make-believe treasures in caves, found spots on the island with the best and loudest echoes. We shot photos of windmills and dovecotes with our pinhole camera and took them to Mr. Roussos, who developed them for us. He even let us into his darkroom and taught us about different developers, fixers, and stop baths.</div>

<div class="line_en">The kids were worse and far bolder. Every day I caught one prowling outside, climbing our wall. We would be working, and Thalia would tap my shoulder with her pencil, tip her chin, and I would turn to find a face, sometimes more than one, pressed to the window. It got so bad, we had to go upstairs and pull all the curtains. One day I opened the door to a boy I knew from school, Petros, and three of his friends. He offered me a handful of coins for a peek. I said no, where did he think he was, a circus?</div>

<div class="line_en">But doing our studies, especially with Mamá away, proved nearly impossible. News of Thalia's disfigurement had spread all over the island, and people kept knocking on the door, fueled by curiosity. You would have thought the island was suddenly running out of flour, garlic, even salt, and our house was the only place you could find it. They barely made an effort to disguise their intent. At the door, their eyes always flew over my shoulder. They craned their necks, stood on tiptoes. Most of them weren't even neighbors. They'd walked miles for a cup of sugar. Of course I never let them in. It gave me some satisfaction to close the door on their faces. But I also felt gloomy, dispirited, aware that if I stayed my life would be too deeply touched by these people. I would, in the end, become one of them.</div>

She was still, and always would be, girded by an orb of curiosity, but even that was waning. She had friends of her own now -- Dori among them -- who were no longer spooked by her appearance, friends with whom she ate lunch, gossiped, played after school, did her studies. She had become, improbably enough, almost ordinary, and I had to admit to a degree of admiration for the way the islanders had accepted her as one of their own.</div>

<div class="line_en">One morning in 2002, more than thirty years later, around the time I am preparing to move from Athens to Kabul, I stumble upon Madaline's obituary in the newspaper. Her last name is listed now as Kouris, but I recognize in the old woman's face a familiar bright-eyed grin, and more than detritus of her youthful beauty. The small paragraph below says that she had briefly been an actress in her youth prior to founding her own theater company in the early 1980s. Her company had received critical praise for several productions, most notably for extended runs of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night in the mid-1990s, Chekhov's The Seagull, and Dimitrios Mpogris's Engagements. The obituary says she was well known among Athens's artistic community for her charity work, her wit, her sense of style, her lavish parties, and her willingness to take chances on unheralded playwrights. The piece says she died after a lengthy battle with emphysema but makes no mention of a surviving spouse or children. I am further stunned to learn that she lived in Athens for more than two decades, at a house barely six blocks from my own place on Kolonaki.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="2002年一个早晨，也就是三十多年之后，我正准备从雅典前往喀布尔的时候，偶然在报纸上看到了玛达丽娜的讣闻。她现在挂着“库里斯”的姓，可我从那老妇人脸上认出的，不仅是她青春美貌的余烬，还有那熟悉的、明眸皓齿的笑容。下面有一小段文字，说她年轻时曾经短暂地做过演员，后来在八十年代初创办了自己的剧团，排演过几部深受评论界赞扬的作品，特别是尤金·奥尼尔的《进入黑夜的漫长旅程》，该剧在九十年代中期连演不衰，还有契诃夫的《海鸥》和迪米特里奥斯·姆波格里斯的《婚约》[16]。讣闻说，因为她的慈善工作，她的多智，她对时尚的敏锐认知，她举办的奢华派对，以及她对众多无名剧作家欣然给予的机会，使她成了雅典文艺圈里众所周知的人物。文章说她死前与肺气肿进行了漫长的苦斗，但没有提及她身后是否还有配偶或子女。我更为震惊的是，她在雅典住了二十多年的房子，离我在科洛纳基的住处只隔了六个路口。【注：[16]迪米特里奥斯·姆波格里斯（Dimitrios Mpogris，1890—1964），又名迪米特里奥斯·博尔格里斯（Dimitrios Bogris），希腊剧作家，1936年首演的《婚约》（Engagements）是现代希腊戏剧史上的悲剧名作。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I put down the paper. To my surprise, I feel a tinge of impatience with this dead woman I have not seen for over thirty years. A surge of resistance to this story of how she had turned out. I had always pictured her living a tumultuous, wayward life, hard years of bad luck -- fits and starts, collapse, regret -- and ill-advised, desperate love affairs. I had always imagined that she'd self-destructed, likely drank herself to the kind of early death that people always call tragic. Part of me had even credited her with the possibility that she had known this, that she had brought Thalia to Tinos to spare her, rescue her from the disasters Madaline knew she was helpless from visiting upon her daughter. But now I picture Madaline the way Mamá always must have: Madaline, the cartographer, sitting down, calmly drawing the map of her future and neatly excluding her burdensome daughter from its borders. And she'd succeeded spectacularly, at least according to this obituary and its clipped account of a mannered life, a life rich with achievement, grace, respect.</div>

Hadn't we both yearned for escape, reinvention, new identities? Hadn't we each, in the end, unmoored ourselves by cutting loose the anchors that weighed us down?

<div class="line_en">Many years later, when I began training as a plastic surgeon, I understood something that I had not that day in the kitchen arguing for Thalia to leave Tinos for the boarding school. I learned that the world didn't see the inside of you, that it didn't care a whit about the hopes and dreams, and sorrows, that lay masked by skin and bone. It was as simple, as absurd, and as cruel as that. My patients knew this. They saw that much of what they were, would be, or could be hinged on the symmetry of their bone structure, the space between their eyes, their chin length, the tip projection of their nose, whether they had an ideal nasofrontal angle or not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多年以后，当我开始接受整形外科的培训时，我理解了某种东西，而那天在厨房，在我力主萨丽娅应该离开蒂诺斯，去上寄宿学校的时候，我还不能理解。后来我懂了，这个世界看不见你的内在，它一点儿也不关心你的希望、梦想，以及忧伤，它们都被皮肤和骨骼遮蔽着。这是如此简单，如此荒谬，又如此残忍。我的病人们知道这些。他们看到了，关于他们是怎样的人，将要，或者可能在很大程度上取决于他们骨架的对称程度，两眼之间的距离，下巴的长短，鼻尖投射角的大小，以及是否拥有一个理想的鼻额骨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At least this is what I tell myself. I suppose there were other reasons I chose plastic surgery. Money, for instance, prestige, social standing. To say I chose it solely because of Thalia is too simple -- lovely as the idea may be -- a bit too orderly and balanced. If I've learned anything in Kabul, it is that human behavior is messy and unpredictable and unconcerned with convenient symmetries. But I find comfort in it, in the idea of a pattern, of a narrative of my life taking shape, like a photograph in a darkroom, a story that slowly emerges and affirms the good I have always wanted to see in myself. It sustains me, this story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少我是这样告诉自己的。我想，还有别的理由让我选择了整形外科。比如说钱，声望，社会地位。若说我仅仅因为萨丽娅才做出这样的选择，那就过于简单——这想法也许可爱——也有点儿过于按部就班和四平八稳了。如果说我在喀布尔学到了什么，那就是人类的行为是混乱的，不可预测的，与方便的对称性毫不相关。可是，我也在选择怎样的生活模式、我的人生故事如何成形的信念中发现了安慰，就像暗房中的一张照片，故事将慢慢显现，来确证我一直想在自己身上看到的善。这个故事支撑着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I spent half of my practice in Athens, erasing wrinkles, lifting eyebrows, stretching jowls, reshaping misbegotten noses. I spent the other half doing what I really wanted to, which was to fly around the world -- to Central America, to sub-Saharan Africa, to South Asia, and to the Far East -- and work on children, repairing cleft lips and palates, removing facial tumors, repairing injuries to their faces. The work in Athens was not nearly as gratifying, but the pay was good, and it afforded me the luxury of taking weeks and months off at a time for my volunteer work.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thalia picks me up from the ferry port. She has on a green wool scarf and a thick dull-rose-colored coat over a cardigan sweater and jeans. She wears her hair long these days, loose over the shoulders and parted in the center. Her hair is white, and it is this feature -- not the mutilated lower face -- that jars me and takes me aback when I see her. Not that it surprises me; Thalia started going gray in her mid-thirties and had cotton-white hair by the end of the following decade. I know I have changed too, the stubbornly growing paunch, the just-as-determined retreat of the hairline, but the decline of one's own body is incremental, as nearly imperceptible as it is insidious. Seeing Thalia white-haired presents jolting evidence of her steady, inevitable march toward old age -- and, by association, my own.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, early in 2002, I took a phone call in my office from a woman I knew. Her name was Amra Ademovic. She was a nurse from Bosnia. She and I had met at a conference in London a few years back and had had a pleasant, weekend-long thing that we'd mutually kept inconsequential, though we had remained in touch and seen each other socially on occasion. She said she was working for a nonprofit in Kabul now and that they were searching for a plastic surgeon to work on children -- cleft lips, facial injuries inflicted by shrapnel and bullets, that sort of thing. I agreed on the spot. I intended to stay for three months. I went late in the spring of 2002. I never came back.</div>

There is a cordial defiance to her now, a slyly teasing way she has of commenting on things I do that I suspect she finds slightly foolish. The brightness in her eyes, this new hearty laugh, the perpetual flush of the cheeks -- the overall impression is, a farmer's wife.

I don't really need the money, she told me. I do it for the game of it. There's still a thrill for me in opening things up and seeing how they work inside. These days, she is like a freelance one-woman IT department. Everything she knows is self-taught.

The air is heavy with sickness. It's not quite a smell; rather, it's like a physical presence. Every doctor knows this. Sickness permeates a room like steam. I stand at the entrance for a moment and allow my eyes to adjust. The darkness is broken by a rectangle of shifting colored light on the dresser on what I take to be Thalia's side of the bed, my old side. It's one of those digital picture frames.

<div class="line_en">I pull up a chair and sit at Mamá's bedside. Looking at her now that my eyes have adjusted, I feel something in me drop. I am startled by how much my mother has shrunk. Already. The floral-print pajamas appear loose around her small shoulders, over the flattened chest. I don't care for the way she is sleeping, with her mouth open and turned down, as though she is having a sour dream. I don't like seeing that her dentures have slid out of place in her sleep. Her eyelids flutter slightly. I sit there awhile. I ask myself, What did you expect? and I listen to the clock ticking on the wall, the clanging of Thalia's spatula against the frying pan from downstairs. I take inventory of the banal details of Mamá's life in this room. The flat-screen TV fastened to the wall; the PC in the corner; the unfinished game of Sudoku on the nightstand, the page marked by a pair of reading glasses; the TV remote; the vial of artificial tears; a tube of steroid cream; a tube of denture glue; a small bottle of pills; and, on the floor, an oyster-colored pair of fuzzy slippers. She would have never worn those before. Beside the slippers, an open bag of pull-on diapers. I cannot reconcile these things with my mother. I resist them. They look to me like the belongings of a stranger. Someone indolent, harmless. Someone with whom you could never be angry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拉过一把椅子，坐到妈妈床边。我的眼睛适应过来了，我看着她，感到心里有什么东西碎了。我吓了一跳，妈妈缩得竟然如此之小。已经如此之小。印花睡衣松松垮垮地兜着她的小肩膀，盖着她已然扁平的胸。我不喜欢她睡觉的样子，嘴巴张开，耷拉着，好像在做一个苦梦。我也不喜欢看到她睡觉时，假牙在嘴里滑得歪七竖八。她眼皮微微颤动了几下。我坐了一会儿。我问自己，你本来指望什么？我听到钟在墙上滴滴答答，楼下萨丽娅的铲子在煎锅里乒乒乓乓。我打量着妈妈房间里平庸生活的细节。固定在墙上的平板电视；屋角的电脑；床头柜上没做完的数独游戏，那一页上放着一副老花镜；电视遥控器；装人工泪液的小药水瓶；一管类固醇药膏；一管假牙胶；一小瓶药片；地板上还有一双牡蛎色的毛茸茸的拖鞋。她以前绝对不会穿这种东西。拖鞋旁边有个敞开的袋子，里面装着纸尿裤。我无法把这些东西和我母亲联系在一起。我抗拒它们。在我看来，它们属于一个陌生人。某个四体不勤、与世无争的人。某个绝对不会让你动怒的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I get up quietly. As I leave the room, something catches my eye. Something framed, mounted on the wall beneath the clock. I can't quite make it out in the dark. I open my cell phone and take a look in its silver glow. It's an AP story about the nonprofit I work with in Kabul. I remember the interview. The journalist was a pleasant Korean-American fellow with a mild stutter. We had shared a plate of qabuli -- Afghan pilaf, with brown rice, raisins, lamb. There is in the center of the story a group photo. Me, some of the children, Nabi in the back, standing rigidly, hands behind his back, looking simultaneously foreboding, shy, and dignified, as Afghans often manage to in pictures. Amra is there too with her adopted daughter, Roshi. All the children are smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我悄悄起身。就在走出房间的当口，我一下子看到了某个东西。某个装在镜框里的东西，钉在钟下面的墙上。黑暗里，我看不出那是什么。我开了手机，借着微光一瞧。原来是美联社的一篇报道，写的是我在喀布尔效力的那家非营利组织。我记得这篇采访。记者是个讨人喜欢的韩裔美国人，有点儿结巴。我们合吃了一盘卡布利——阿富汗的抓饭，里面是糙米、葡萄干和羊肉。文章正中配了张合影。我，几个孩子，纳比在后排，直挺挺地站着，手背在身后，兼具多种表情：愁苦，害羞，以及庄重，一如阿富汗人在照片上经常刻意摆出的姿态。阿姆拉也在，还有她的养女罗诗。所有孩子都面带笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

I cannot pretend to know what it must have been like to gaze at that face in the mirror each day, to take stock of its ghastly ruin, and to summon the will to accept it. The mountainous strain of it, the effort, the patience. Her acceptance taking shape slowly, over years, like rocks of a beachside cliff sculpted by the pounding tides. It took the dog minutes to give Thalia her face, and a lifetime for her to mold it into an identity. She would not let me undo it all with my scalpel. It would be like inflicting a fresh wound over the old one.</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember all the times I tried to convince her to let me work on her face. I told her that surgical techniques had come a long way since the 1960s, and that I was certain I could, if not fix, then at least significantly improve her disfigurement. Thalia refused, to enormous bewilderment on my part. This is who I am, she said to me. An insipid, unsatisfactory answer, I thought at the time. What did that even mean? I didn't understand it. I had uncharitable thoughts of prison inmates, lifers, afraid to get out, terrified of being paroled, terrified of change, terrified of facing a new life outside barbed wire and guard towers.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, we lie outside on lounge chairs. Mamá wears a thick scarf and a gray parka, her legs warmed against the sharp chill by a fleece blanket. We sip coffee and nibble on bits of the cinnamon-flavored baked quince Thalia has bought for the occasion. We are wearing our eclipse glasses, looking up at the sky. The sun has a small bite taken from its northern rim, looking somewhat like the logo on the Apple laptop Thalia periodically opens to post remarks on an online forum. Up and down the street, people have settled on the sidewalks and rooftops to watch the spectacle. Some have taken their families to the other end of the island, where the Hellenic Astronomical Society has set up telescopes.</div>

<div class="line_en">I lay on the couch the night before, thinking about what Mamá had said, and my thoughts had wandered to Madaline. I remembered how, as a boy, I would stew over all the things Mamá wouldn't do, things other mothers did. Hold my hand when we walked. Sit me up on her lap, read bedtime stories, kiss my face good night. Those things were true enough. But, all those years, I'd been blind to a greater truth, which lay unacknowledged and unappreciated, buried deep beneath my grievances. It was this: that my mother would never leave me. This was her gift to me, the ironclad knowledge that she would never do to me what Madaline had done to Thalia. She was my mother and she would not leave me. This I had simply accepted and expected. I had no more thanked her for it than I did the sun for shining on me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, all around us -- on the ground, on the walls, on our clothing -- little shining sickles of light have materialized, the crescent-shaped sun beaming through the leaves of our olive tree.

<div class="line_en">I am fifty-five years old. I have waited all my life to hear those words. Is it too late now for this? For us? Have we squandered too much for too long, Mamá and I? Part of me thinks it is better to go on as we have, to act as though we don't know how ill suited we have been for each other. Less painful that way. Perhaps better than this belated offering. This fragile, trembling little glimpse of how it could have been between us. All it will beget is regret, I tell myself, and what good is regret? It brings back nothing. What we have lost is irretrievable.</div>
