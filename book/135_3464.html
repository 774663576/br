<div class="line_en">When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again.</div>

<div class="line_en">I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of these questions in this book. In most books, the I, or first person, is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要不是市民们曾特别仔细地打听我的生活方式，我本不会这般唐突，拿私事来读请读者注意的。有些人说我这个生活方式怪僻，虽然我根本不觉得怪僻，考虑到我那些境遇，我只觉得非常自然，而且合情合理呢。有些人则问我有什么吃的；我是否感到寂寞，我害怕吗，等等。另下些人还好奇得很，想知道我的哪一部分收入捐给慈善事业了，还有一些人，家大口阔，想知道我赡养了多少个贫儿。所以这本书在答复这一类的问题时，请对我并无特殊兴趣的读者给以谅解。许多书，避而不用所谓第一人称的“我”字；本书是用的；这本书的特点便是“我”字用得特别多。其实，无论什么书都是第一人称在发言，我们却常把这点忘掉了。如果我的知人之深，比得上我的自知之明，我就不会畅谈自我，谈那么多了。不幸我阅历浅陋，我只得局限于这一个主题。但是，我对于每一个作家，都不仅仅要求他写他听来的别人的生活，还要求他迟早能简单而诚恳地写出自己的生活，写得好像是他从远方寄亲人似的；因为我觉得一个人若生活得诚恳，他一定是生活在一个遥远的地方了。下面的这些文字，对于清寒的学生，或许特别地适宜。至于其余的读者，我想他们是会取其适用的。因为，没有人会削足适履的；只有合乎尺寸的衣履，才能对一个人有用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and Sandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England; something about your condition, especially your outward condition or circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is, whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot be improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What I have heard of Bramins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward, over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders "until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach"; or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars -- even these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor. They have no friend Iolaus to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydra's head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.</div>

<div class="line_en">I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man's life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well-nigh crushed and smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and woodlot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh.</div>

By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal.

<div class="line_en">Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he remember well his ignorance -- which his growth requires -- who has so often to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him. The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.</div>

I have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called by the Latins aes alienum, another's brass, for some of their coins were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other's brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today, insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many modes, only not state-prison offenses; lying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that you may lay up something against a sick day, something to be tucked away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how little.</div>

<div class="line_en">I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both North and South. It is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself. Talk of a divinity in man! Look at the teamster on the highway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being immortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, a fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate. Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy and imagination -- what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Think, also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats.

<div class="line_en">When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief end of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What old people say you cannot do, you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough once, perchance, to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new people put a little dry wood under a pot, and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost. One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned anything of absolute value by living. Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything to the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any experience which I think valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my Mentors said nothing about.</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by their predecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to have been cared for. According to Evelyn, "the wise Solomon prescribed ordinances for the very distances of trees; and the Roman prætors have decided how often you may go into your neighbor's land to gather the acorns which fall on it without trespass, and what share belongs to that neighbor." Hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut our nails; that is, even with the ends of the fingers, neither shorter nor longer. Undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as Adam. But man's capacities have never been measured; nor are we to judge of what he can do by any precedents, so little has been tried. Whatever have been thy failures hitherto, "be not afflicted, my child, for who shall assign to thee what thou hast left undone?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere. Nature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strength. The incessant anxiety and strain of some is a well-nigh incurable form of disease. We are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we do; and yet how much is not done by us! or, what if we had been taken sick? How vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if we can avoid it; all the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties. So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change. This is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre. All change is a miracle to contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant. Confucius said, "To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge." When one man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to his understanding, I foresee that all men at length establish their lives on that basis.</div>

<div class="line_en">Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which I have referred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be troubled, or at least careful. It would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over the old day-books of the merchants, to see what it was that men most commonly bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest groceries. For the improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of man's existence; as our skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让我们思考一下，我前面所说的大多数人的忧虑和烦恼又是些什么，其中有多少是必须忧虑的，至少是值得小心对待的呢？虽然生活在外表的文明中，我们若能过一过原始性的、新开辟的垦区生活还是有益处的，即使仅仅为了明白生活必需品大致是些什么，及如何才能得到这些必需品，甚至翻一翻商店里的古老的流水账，看看商店里经常出售些什么，又存积哪些货物，就是看看最杂的杂货究竟是一些什么也好。时代虽在演进，对人类生存的基本原则却还没有发生多少影响：好比我们的骨骼，跟我们的祖先的骨骼，大约是区别不出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the words, necessary of life, I mean whatever, of all that man obtains by his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use has become, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from savageness, or poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it. To many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life, Food. To the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable grass, with water to drink; unless he seeks the Shelter of the forest or the mountain's shadow. None of the brute creation requires more than Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man in this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a prospect of success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and cooked food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature. By proper Shelter and Clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat; but with an excess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an external heat greater than our own internal, may not cookery properly be said to begin? Darwin, the naturalist, says of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own party, who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too warm, these naked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great surprise, "to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting." So, we are told, the New Hollander goes naked with impunity, while the European shivers in his clothes. Is it impossible to combine the hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the civilized man? According to Liebig, man's body is a stove, and food the fuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm less. The animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and disease and death take place when this is too rapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in the draught, the fire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with fire; but so much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the above list, that the expression, animal life, is nearly synonymous with the expression, animal heat; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel which keeps up the fire within us -- and Fuel serves only to prepare that Food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from without -- Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the heat thus generated and absorbed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所谓生活必需品，在我的意思中，是指一切人用了自己的精力收获得来的那种物品：或是它开始就显得很重要，或是由于长久的习惯，因此对于人生具有了这样的重要性，即使有人尝试着不要它，其人数也是很少的，他们或者是由于野蛮，或是出于穷困，或者只是为了一种哲学的缘故，才这么做的。对于许多人，具有这样的意义的生活必需品只有一种，即食物。原野上的牛只需要几英寸长的可咀嚼的青草和一些冷水；除非加上了它们要寻求的森林或山荫的遮蔽。野兽的生存都只需要食物和荫蔽之处。但人类，在天时中，其生活之必需品可分为：食物、住宅、衣服和燃料；除非获有这些，我们是无法自由地面对真正的人生问题的，更无法展望成就了。人不仅发明了屋子，还发明了衣服，煮熟了食物；可能是偶然发现了火焰的热度，后来利用了它，起先它还是奢侈品哩，而到目前，烤火取暖也是必需品了。我们到猫狗也同样地获得了这个第二天性。住得合适，穿得合适，就能合理地保持体内的热度，若住得和穿得太热的话，或烤火烤得太热时，外边的热度高于体内的热度，岂不是说在烘烤人肉了吗？自然科学家达尔文说起火地岛的居民，当他自己一伙人穿着衣服还烤火，尚且不觉得热，那时裸体的野蛮人站得很远，却使人看到了大为吃惊，他们“被火焰烘烤得竟然汗流浃背了”。同样，据说新荷兰人赤裸身体而泰然自若地跑来跑去，欧洲人穿了衣服还颤抖呢。这些野蛮人的坚强和文明人的睿智难道不能够相提并论吗？按照李比希的说法，人体是一只炉子，食物是保持肺部内燃的燃料。冷天我们吃得多，热天少。动物的体温是缓慢内燃的结果，而疾病和死亡则是在内燃得太旺盛的时候发生的；或者因为燃料没有了，或者因为通风装置出了毛病，火焰便会熄灭。自然，我们不能把生命的体温与火焰混为一谈，我们的譬喻就到此为止。所以，从上面的陈述来看，动物的生命这一个词语可以跟动物的体温作为同义语用：食物，被作为内燃的燃料，——煮熟食物的也是燃料，煮熟的食物自外吞入体内，也是为增加我们体内热量的，——此外，住所和衣服，也是为了保持这样地产生和吸收的热量的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the vital heat in us. What pains we accordingly take, not only with our Food, and Clothing, and Shelter, but with our beds, which are our night-clothes, robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter, as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow! The poor man is wont to complain that this is a cold world; and to cold, no less physical than social, we refer directly a great part of our ails. The summer, in some climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel, except to cook his Food, is then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the fruits are sufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more various, and more easily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or half unnecessary. At the present day, and in this country, as I find by my own experience, a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a wheelbarrow, etc., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery, and access to a few books, rank next to necessaries, and can all be obtained at a trifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go to the other side of the globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote themselves to trade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may live -- that is, keep comfortably warm -- and die in New England at last. The luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot; as I implied before, they are cooked, of course à la mode.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor. The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward. We know not much about them. It is remarkable that we know so much of them as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in agriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by conformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the progenitors of a noble race of men. But why do men degenerate ever? What makes families run out? What is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys nations? Are we sure that there is none of it in our own lives? The philosopher is in advance of his age even in the outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered, clothed, warmed, like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and not maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分的奢侈品，大部分的所谓生活的舒适，非但没有必要，而且对人类进步大有妨碍。所以关于奢侈与舒适，最明智的人生活得甚至比穷人更加简单和朴素。中国、印度、波斯和希腊的古哲学家都是一个类型的人物，外表生活再穷没有，而内心生活再富不过。我们都不够理解他们。然而可惊的一点是，我们居然对于他们知道得不少呢。近代那些改革家，各民族的救星，也都如此。唯有站在我们所谓的甘贫乐苦这有利地位上，才能成为大公无私的聪明的观察者。无论在农业，商业，文学或艺术中，奢侈生活产生的果实都是奢侈的。近来是哲学教授满天飞，哲学家一个没有。然而教授是可羡的，因为教授的生活是可羡的。但是，要做一个哲学家的活，不但要有精美的思想，不但要建立起一个学派来，而且要这样地爱智慧，从而按照了智慧的指示，过着一种简单、独立、大度、信任的生活。解决生命的一些问题，不但要在理论上，而且要在实践中。大学问家和思想家的成功，通常不是帝王式的，也不是英豪式的，反而是朝臣式的成功。他们应付生活，往往求其与习俗相符合，像他们的父辈一般，所以一点不能成为更好的人类的始祖。可是，为什么人类总在退化？是什么使得那些家族没落的？使国家衰亡的糜侈是什么性质的呢？在我们的生活中，我们能否确定自己并未这样？哲学家甚至在生活的外形上也是处在时代前列的。他不像他同时代人那样地吃喝、居住、穿着、取暖。一个人既是哲学家，怎会没有比别人更好的养身的保持体温的方法呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food, larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing, more numerous, incessant, and hotter fires, and the like. When he has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced. The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also with confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?-- for the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far from the ground, and are not treated like the humbler esculents, which, though they may be biennials, are cultivated only till they have perfected their root, and often cut down at top for this purpose, so that most would not know them in their flowering season.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of a well-known lawyer in my neighborhood. "Do you wish to buy any baskets?" he asked. "No, we do not want any," was the reply. "What!" exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, "do you mean to starve us?" Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off -- that the lawyer had only to weave arguments, and, by some magic, wealth and standing followed -- he had said to himself: I will go into business; I will weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that when he had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be the white man's to buy them. He had not discovered that it was necessary for him to make it worth the other's while to buy them, or at least make him think that it was so, or to make something else which it would be worth his while to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a delicate texture, but I had not made it worth any one's while to buy them. Yet not the less, in my case, did I think it worth my while to weave them, and instead of studying how to make it worth men's while to buy my baskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling them. The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the others?</div>

<div class="line_en">Finding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in the court house, or any curacy or living anywhere else, but I must shift for myself, I turned my face more exclusively than ever to the woods, where I was better known. I determined to go into business at once, and not wait to acquire the usual capital, using such slender means as I had already got. My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not to live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to transact some private business with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from accomplishing which for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and business talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.</div>

To oversee all the details yourself in person; to be at once pilot and captain, and owner and underwriter; to buy and sell and keep the accounts; to read every letter received, and write or read every letter sent; to superintend the discharge of imports night and day; to be upon many parts of the coast almost at the same time -- often the richest freight will be discharged upon a Jersey shore;-- to be your own telegraph, unweariedly sweeping the horizon, speaking all passing vessels bound coastwise; to keep up a steady despatch of commodities, for the supply of such a distant and exorbitant market; to keep yourself informed of the state of the markets, prospects of war and peace everywhere, and anticipate the tendencies of trade and civilization -- taking advantage of the results of all exploring expeditions, using new passages and all improvements in navigation;-- charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new lights and buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables to be corrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often splits upon a rock that should have reached a friendly pier -- there is the untold fate of La Prouse;-- universal science to be kept pace with, studying the lives of all great discoverers and navigators, great adventurers and merchants, from Hanno and the Phoenicians down to our day; in fine, account of stock to be taken from time to time, to know how you stand.

<div class="line_en">As this business was to be entered into without the usual capital, it may not be easy to conjecture where those means, that will still be indispensable to every such undertaking, were to be obtained. As for Clothing, to come at once to the practical part of the question, perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty and a regard for the opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a true utility. Let him who has work to do recollect that the object of clothing is, first, to retain the vital heat, and secondly, in this state of society, to cover nakedness, and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work may be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe. Kings and queens who wear a suit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to their majesties, cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits. They are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on. Every day our garments become more assimilated to ourselves, receiving the impress of the wearer's character, until we hesitate to lay them aside without such delay and medical appliances and some such solemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience. But even if the rent is not mended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I sometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as this -- Who could wear a patch, or two extra seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they believed that their prospects for life would be ruined if they should do it. It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident happens to a gentleman's legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens to the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for it; for he considers, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We know but few men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scarecrow in your last shift, you standing shiftless by, who would not soonest salute the scarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat and coat on a stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a little more weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a dog that barked at every stranger who approached his master's premises with clothes on, but was easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes. Could you, in such a case, tell surely of any company of civilized men which belonged to the most respected class? When Madam Pfeiffer, in her adventurous travels round the world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic Russia, she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travelling dress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she "was now in a civilized country, where…people are judged of by their clothes." Even in our democratic New England towns the accidental possession of wealth, and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone, obtain for the possessor almost universal respect. But they yield such respect, numerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need to have a missionary sent to them. Beside, clothes introduced sewing, a kind of work which you may call endless; a woman's dress, at least, is never done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鉴于我这行业是没有通常的经费先行交易的，所以我从什么地方得到凡是这样的行业都不能缺少的东西呢，也许不容易揣测吧。让我们立刻到实际问题上来，先说衣服，我们采购衣服，常常是由爱好新奇的心理所引导的，并且关心别人对它的部意见，而不大考虑这些衣服的真实用处。让那些有工作做的人记着穿衣服的目标，第一是保持养身的体温，第二是为了在目前的社会中要把赤身露体来遮盖；现在，他可以判断一下，有多少必需的重要工作可以完成，而不必在衣橱中增添什么衣服。国王和王后的每一件衣服都只穿一次，虽然有御裁缝专司其事，他们却不穿上合身衣服的愉快。他们不过是挂干净衣服的木架。而我们的衣服，却一天天地跟我们同化了，印上了穿衣人的性格，直到我们舍不得把它们丢掉，要丢掉它们，正如抛弃我们的躯体那样，总不免感到恋恋不舍，要看病吃药作些补救，而且带着十分沉重的心情。其实没有人穿了有补钉的衣服而在我的眼里降低了身份；但我很明白，一般人心里，为了衣服忧思真多，衣服要穿得入时，至少也要清洁，而且不能有补钉，至于他们有无健全的良心，从不在乎。其实，即使衣服破了不补，所暴露的最大缺点也不过是不考虑小洞之会变成大洞。有时我用这样的方法来测定我的朋友们，——谁肯把膝盖以上有补钉的，或者只是多了两条缝的衣服，穿在身上？大多数人都好像认为，如果他们这样做了，从此就毁了终身。宁可跛了一条腿进城，他们也不肯穿着破裤子去。一位绅士有腿伤，是很平常的事，这是有办法补救的；如果裤脚管破了，却无法补救；因为人们关心的并不是真正应该敬重的东西，只是关心那些受人尊敬的东西。我们认识的人很少，我们认识的衣服和裤子却怪多。你给稻草人穿上你最后一件衣服，你自己不穿衣服站在旁边，哪一个经过的人不马上就向稻草人致敬呢？那天，我经过一片玉米田，就在那头戴帽子、身穿上衣的木桩旁边，我认出了那个农田主人。他比我上一回看见他，只不过凤吹雨打更显得憔悴了一些。我听说过，一条狗向所有穿了衣服走到它主人的地方来的人吠叫，却很容易被一个裸体的窃贼，一声不响。这是一个有趣的问题啊，没有衣服的话，人们将能多大地保持他们的身份？没有了衣服的话，你能不能在任何一群文明人中间，肯定地指出谁个最尊贵？斐斐夫人在她周游世界，从东到西的旅行中，当她非常地接近了亚洲的俄罗斯，要去谒见当地长官的时候，她说，她觉得不能再穿旅行服装了，因为她“现在是在一个文明国家里面，那里的人民是根据衣服来评价人的”。即使在我们这号称的新英格兰城中，只要有钱穿得讲究住得阔绰，具有了那种偶然的因素，他就受尽了众人的敬仰。可是，这些敬仰着的众人，人数真多，都是异教徒，所以应该派遣一个传教士前去。话说回来，衣服是要缝纫的，缝纫可是一种所谓无穷无尽的工作；至少，一个女人的衣服是从没有完工的一天的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served his valet -- if a hero ever has a valet -- bare feet are older than shoes, and he can make them do. Only they who go to soirées and legislative balls must have new coats, coats to change as often as the man changes in them. But if my jacket and trousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will do; will they not? Who ever saw his old clothes -- his old coat, actually worn out, resolved into its primitive elements, so that it was not a deed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be bestowed on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do with less? I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes. If there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made to fit? If you have any enterprise before you, try it in your old clothes. All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be. Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the fowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary ponds to spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar its wormy coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil.

I believe that all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt. It is desirable that a man be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in the dark, and that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly that, if an enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk out the gate empty-handed without anxiety.

When I hear this oracular sentence, I am for a moment absorbed in thought, emphasizing to myself each word separately that I may come at the meaning of it, that I may find out by what degree of consanguinity They are related to me, and what authority they may have in an affair which affects me so nearly; and, finally, I am inclined to answer her with equal mystery, and without any more emphasis of the "they"—"It is true, they did not make them so recently, but they do now." Of what use this measuring of me if she does not measure my character, but only the breadth of my shoulders, as it were a peg to bang the coat on?

<div class="line_en">On the whole, I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in this or any country risen to the dignity of an art. At present men make shift to wear what they can get. Like shipwrecked sailors, they put on what they can find on the beach, and at a little distance, whether of space or time, laugh at each other's masquerade. Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new. We are amused at beholding the costume of Henry VIII, or Queen Elizabeth, as much as if it was that of the King and Queen of the Cannibal Islands. All costume off a man is pitiful or grotesque. It is only the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it which restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people.

The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for a Shelter, I will not deny that this is now a necessary of life, though there are instances of men having done without it for long periods in colder countries than this. Samuel Laing says that "the Laplander in his skin dress, and in a skin bag which he puts over his head and shoulders, will sleep night after night on the snow…in a degree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed to it in any woollen clothing." He had seen them asleep thus. Yet he adds, "They are not hardier than other people." But, probably, man did not live long on the earth without discovering the convenience which there is in a house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may have originally signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the family; though these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates where the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy season chiefly, and two thirds of the year, except for a parasol, is unnecessary. In our climate, in the summer, it was formerly almost solely a covering at night. In the Indian gazettes a wigwam was the symbol of a day's march, and a row of them cut or painted on the bark of a tree signified that so many times they had camped. Man was not made so large limbed and robust but that he must seek to narrow his world and wall in a space such as fitted him. He was at first bare and out of doors; but though this was pleasant enough in serene and warm weather, by daylight, the rainy season and the winter, to say nothing of the torrid sun, would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he had not made haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house. Adam and Eve, according to the fable, wore the bower before other clothes. Man wanted a home, a place of warmth, or comfort, first of warmth, then the warmth of the affections.</div>

<div class="line_en">We may imagine a time when, in the infancy of the human race, some enterprising mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter. Every child begins the world again, to some extent, and loves to stay outdoors, even in wet and cold. It plays house, as well as horse, having an instinct for it. Who does not remember the interest with which, when young, he looked at shelving rocks, or any approach to a cave? It was the natural yearning of that portion, any portion of our most primitive ancestor which still survived in us. From the cave we have advanced to roofs of palm leaves, of bark and boughs, of linen woven and stretched, of grass and straw, of boards and shingles, of stones and tiles. At last, we know not what it is to live in the open air, and our lives are domestic in more senses than we think. From the hearth the field is a great distance. It would be well, perhaps, if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in caves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, if one designs to construct a dwelling-house, it behooves him to exercise a little Yankee shrewdness, lest after all he find himself in a workhouse, a labyrinth without a clue, a museum, an almshouse, a prison, or a splendid mausoleum instead. Consider first how slight a shelter is absolutely necessary. I have seen Penobscot Indians, in this town, living in tents of thin cotton cloth, while the snow was nearly a foot deep around them, and I thought that they would be glad to have it deeper to keep out the wind. Formerly, when how to get my living honestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits, was a question which vexed me even more than it does now, for unfortunately I am become somewhat callous, I used to see a large box by the railroad, six feet long by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at night; and it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might get such a one for a dollar, and, having bored a few auger holes in it, to admit the air at least, get into it when it rained and at night, and hook down the lid, and so have freedom in his love, and in his soul be free. This did not appear the worst, nor by any means a despicable alternative. You could sit up as late as you pleased, and, whenever you got up, go abroad without any landlord or house-lord dogging you for rent. Many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a larger and more luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box as this. I am far from jesting. Economy is a subject which admits of being treated with levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable house for a rude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was once made here almost entirely of such materials as Nature furnished ready to their hands. Gookin, who was superintendent of the Indians subject to the Massachusetts Colony, writing in 1674, says, "The best of their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with barks of trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is up, and made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty timber, when they are green… The meaner sort are covered with mats which they make of a kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently tight and warm, but not so good as the former… Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred feet long and thirty feet broad… I have often lodged in their wigwams, and found them as warm as the best English houses." He adds that they were commonly carpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroidered mats, and were furnished with various utensils. The Indians had advanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a mat suspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string. Such a lodge was in the first instance constructed in a day or two at most, and taken down and put up in a few hours; and every family owned one, or its apartment in one.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best, and sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I speak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have their nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams, in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a shelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for this outside garment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which would buy a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long as they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax, the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared with the savage's. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars (these are the country rates) entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fire-place, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a poor civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man -- and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their advantages -- it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer's life, even if he is not encumbered with a family -- estimating the pecuniary value of every man's labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others receive less;-- so that he must have spent more than half his life commonly before his wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms?</div>

But perhaps a man is not required to bury himself.

<div class="line_en">When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least as well off as the other classes, I find that for the most part they have been toiling twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become the real owners of their farms, which commonly they have inherited with encumbrances, or else bought with hired money -- and we may regard one third of that toil as the cost of their houses -- but commonly they have not paid for them yet. It is true, the encumbrances sometimes outweigh the value of the farm, so that the farm itself becomes one great encumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it, being well acquainted with it, as he says. On applying to the assessors, I am surprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town who own their farms free and clear. If you would know the history of these homesteads, inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged. The man who has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare that every neighbor can point to him. I doubt if there are three such men in Concord. What has been said of the merchants, that a very large majority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure to fail, is equally true of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however, one of them says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuine pecuniary failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements, because it is inconvenient; that is, it is the moral character that breaks down. But this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter, and suggests, beside, that probably not even the other three succeed in saving their souls, but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than they who fail honestly. Bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards from which much of our civilization vaults and turns its somersets, but the savage stands on the unelastic plank of famine.

<div class="line_en">But how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be found that just in proportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances above the savage, others have been degraded below him. The luxury of one class is counterbalanced by the indigence of another. On the one side is the palace, on the other are the almshouse and "silent poor." The myriads who built the pyramids to be the tombs of the Pharaohs were fed on garlic, and it may be were not decently buried themselves. The mason who finishes the cornice of the palace returns at night perchance to a hut not so good as a wigwam. It is a mistake to suppose that, in a country where the usual evidences of civilization exist, the condition of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as that of savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich. To know this I should not need to look farther than to the shanties which everywhere border our railroads, that last improvement in civilization; where I see in my daily walks human beings living in sties, and all winter with an open door, for the sake of light, without any visible, often imaginable, wood-pile, and the forms of both old and young are permanently contracted by the long habit of shrinking from cold and misery, and the development of all their limbs and faculties is checked. It certainly is fair to look at that class by whose labor the works which distinguish this generation are accomplished. Such too, to a greater or less extent, is the condition of the operatives of every denomination in England, which is the great workhouse of the world. Or I could refer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the white or enlightened spots on the map. Contrast the physical condition of the Irish with that of the North American Indian, or the South Sea Islander, or any other savage race before it was degraded by contact with the civilized man. Yet I have no doubt that that people's rulers are as wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their condition only proves what squalidness may consist with civilization. I hardly need refer now to the laborers in our Southern States who produce the staple exports of this country, and are themselves a staple production of the South. But to confine myself to those who are said to be in moderate circumstances.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have. As if one were to wear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him, or, gradually leaving off palm-leaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin, complain of hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown! It is possible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we have, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for. Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes to be content with less? Shall the respectable citizen thus gravely teach, by precept and example, the necessity of the young man's providing a certain number of superfluous glow-shoes, and umbrellas, and empty guest chambers for empty guests, before he dies? Why should not our furniture be as simple as the Arab's or the Indian's? When I think of the benefactors of the race, whom we have apotheosized as messengers from heaven, bearers of divine gifts to man, I do not see in my mind any retinue at their heels, any carload of fashionable furniture. Or what if I were to allow -- would it not be a singular allowance?-- that our furniture should be more complex than the Arab's, in proportion as we are morally and intellectually his superiors! At present our houses are cluttered and defiled with it, and a good housewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole, and not leave her morning's work undone. Morning work! By the blushes of Aurora and the music of Memnon, what should be man's morning work in this world? I had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the furniture of my mind was all undusted still, and threw them out the window in disgust. How, then, could I have a furnished house? I would rather sit in the open air, for no dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has broken ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">The very simplicity and nakedness of man's life in the primitive ages imply this advantage, at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep, he contemplated his journey again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and was either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing the mountain-tops. But lo! men have become the tools of their tools. The man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is become a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for shelter, a housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of agri-culture. We have built for this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten. There is actually no place in this village for a work of fine art, if any had come down to us, to stand, for our lives, our houses and streets, furnish no proper pedestal for it. There is not a nail to hang a picture on, nor a shelf to receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I consider how our houses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their internal economy managed and sustained, I wonder that the floor does not give way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the mantelpiece, and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and honest though earthy foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so-called rich and refined life is a thing jumped at, and I do not get on in the enjoyment of the fine arts which adorn it, my attention being wholly occupied with the jump; for I remember that the greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level ground. Without factitious support, man is sure to come to earth again beyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to the proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you one of the ninety-seven who fail, or the three who succeed? Answer me these questions, and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and find them ornamental. The cart before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful. Before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must be stripped, and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation: now, a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors, where there is no house and no housekeeper.</div>

<div class="line_en">Old Johnson, in his "Wonder-Working Providence," speaking of the first settlers of this town, with whom he was contemporary, tells us that "they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under some hillside, and, casting the soil aloft upon timber, they make a smoky fire against the earth, at the highest side." They did not "provide them houses," says he, "till the earth, by the Lord's blessing, brought forth bread to feed them," and the first year's crop was so light that "they were forced to cut their bread very thin for a long season." The secretary of the Province of New Netherland, writing in Dutch, in 1650, for the information of those who wished to take up land there, states more particularly that "those in New Netherland, and especially in New England, who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to their wishes, dig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, six or seven feet deep, as long and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside with wood all round the wall, and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth; floor this cellar with plank, and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling, raise a roof of spars clear up, and cover the spars with bark or green sods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their entire families for two, three, and four years, it being understood that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the size of the family. The wealthy and principal men in New England, in the beginning of the colonies, commenced their first dwelling-houses in this fashion for two reasons: firstly, in order not to waste time in building, and not to want food the next season; secondly, in order not to discourage poor laboring people whom they brought over in numbers from Fatherland. In the course of three or four years, when the country became adapted to agriculture, they built themselves handsome houses, spending on them several thousands."</div>

<div class="line_en">Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house, and began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their youth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without borrowing, but perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men to have an interest in your enterprise. The owner of the axe, as he released his hold on it, said that it was the apple of his eye; but I returned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant hillside where I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories were springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though there were some open spaces, and it was all dark-colored and saturated with water. There were some slight flurries of snow during the days that I worked there; but for the most part when I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence another year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the winter of man's discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a pond-hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition; but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life. I had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun to thaw them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in the early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog.</div>

Each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned by its stump, for I had borrowed other tools by this time. My days in the woods were not very long ones; yet I usually carried my dinner of bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped, at noon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut off, and to my bread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were covered with a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I was more the friend than the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them, having become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which I had made.</div>

Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own words, they were "good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window"-- of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents tonight, he to vacate at five tomorrow morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large bundle held their all -- bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens -- all but the cat; she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and removed it to the pond-side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on the grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun. One early thrush gave me a note or two as I drove along the woodland path. I was informed treacherously by a young Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an Irishman, in the intervals of the carting, transferred the still tolerable, straight, and drivable nails, staples, and spikes to his pocket, and then stood when I came back to pass the time of day, and look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation; there being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent spectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of the gods of Troy.</div>

The sides were left shelving, and not stoned; but the sun having never shone on them, the sand still keeps its place. It was but two hours' work. I took particular pleasure in this breaking of ground, for in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable temperature. Under the most splendid house in the city is still to be found the cellar where they store their roots as of old, and long after the superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the earth.

<div class="line_en">At length, in the beginning of May, with the help of some of my acquaintances, rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity, I set up the frame of my house. No man was ever more honored in the character of his raisers than I. They are destined, I trust, to assist at the raising of loftier structures one day. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of July, as soon as it was boarded and roofed, for the boards were carefully feather-edged and lapped, so that it was perfectly impervious to rain, but before boarding I laid the foundation of a chimney at one end, bringing two cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms. I built the chimney after my hoeing in the fall, before a fire became necessary for warmth, doing my cooking in the meanwhile out of doors on the ground, early in the morning: which mode I still think is in some respects more convenient and agreeable than the usual one. When it stormed before my bread was baked, I fixed a few boards over the fire, and sat under them to watch my loaf, and passed some pleasant hours in that way. In those days, when my hands were much employed, I read but little, but the least scraps of paper which lay on the ground, my holder, or tablecloth, afforded me as much entertainment, in fact answered the same purpose as the Iliad.</div>

<div class="line_en">It would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than I did, considering, for instance, what foundation a door, a window, a cellar, a garret, have in the nature of man, and perchance never raising any superstructure until we found a better reason for it than our temporal necessities even. There is some of the same fitness in a man's building his own house that there is in a bird's building its own nest. Who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic faculty would be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so engaged? But alas! we do like cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in nests which other birds have built, and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical notes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter? What does architecture amount to in the experience of the mass of men? I never in all my walks came across a man engaged in so simple and natural an occupation as building his house. We belong to the community. It is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a man; it is as much the preacher, and the merchant, and the farmer. Where is this division of labor to end? and what object does it finally serve? No doubt another may also think for me; but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">True, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard of one at least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core of truth, a necessity, and hence a beauty, as if it were a revelation to him. All very well perhaps from his point of view, but only a little better than the common dilettantism. A sentimental reformer in architecture, he began at the cornice, not at the foundation. It was only how to put a core of truth within the ornaments, that every sugarplum, in fact, might have an almond or caraway seed in it -- though I hold that almonds are most wholesome without the sugar -- and not how the inhabitant, the indweller, might build truly within and without, and let the ornaments take care of themselves. What reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were something outward and in the skin merely -- that the tortoise got his spotted shell, or the shell-fish its mother-o'-pearl tints, by such a contract as the inhabitants of Broadway their Trinity Church? But a man has no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its shell: nor need the soldier be so idle as to try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard. The enemy will find it out. He may turn pale when the trial comes. This man seemed to me to lean over the cornice, and timidly whisper his half truth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of architectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within outward, out of the necessities and character of the indweller, who is the only builder -- out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness, without ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional beauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty of life. The most interesting dwellings in this country, as the painter knows, are the most unpretending, humble log huts and cottages of the poor commonly; it is the life of the inhabitants whose shells they are, and not any peculiarity in their surfaces merely, which makes them picturesque; and equally interesting will be the citizen's suburban box, when his life shall be as simple and as agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little straining after effect in the style of his dwelling. A great proportion of architectural ornaments are literally hollow, and a September gale would strip them off, like borrowed plumes, without injury to the substantials. They can do without architecture who have no olives nor wines in the cellar. What if an equal ado were made about the ornaments of style in literature, and the architects of our bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the architects of our churches do? So are made the belles-lettres and the beaux-arts and their professors. Much it concerns a man, forsooth, how a few sticks are slanted over him or under him, and what colors are daubed upon his box. It would signify somewhat, if, in any earnest sense, he slanted them and daubed it; but the spirit having departed out of the tenant, it is of a piece with constructing his own coffin -- the architecture of the grave -- and "carpenter" is but another name for "coffin-maker." One man says, in his despair or indifference to life, take up a handful of the earth at your feet, and paint your house that color. Is he thinking of his last and narrow house? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of leisure he must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt? Better paint your house your own complexion; let it turn pale or blush for you. An enterprise to improve the style of cottage architecture! When you have got my ornaments ready, I will wear them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真的，在这个国家里面有一种人叫做建筑师，至少我听说过一个建筑师有一种想法要使建筑上的装饰具有一种真理之核心，一种必要性，因此有一种美，好像这是神灵给他的启示。从他的观点来说，是很好的罗，实际他比普通爱好美术的外行人只高明一点儿。一个建筑学上感情用事的改革家，他不从基础，却从飞檐人手。仅在装饰中放一个真理之核心，像糖拌梅子里面嵌进一粒杏仁或者一粒葛缕子，——我总觉得吃杏仁，不用糖更有益于健康，——他不想想居民，即住在房屋里面的人，可以把房屋建筑得里里外外都很好，而不去管什么装饰。哪个讲理性的人会认为装饰只是表面的，仅属于皮肤上的东西，——认为乌龟获得斑纹的甲壳，贝类获得珠母的光泽，就像百老汇的居民获得三一教堂似的要签订什么合同呢？一个人跟他自己的房屋建筑的风格无关，就跟乌龟跟它的甲壳无关一样：当兵的不必那么无聊，把自己的勇气的确切的颜色画在旗帜上。敌人会知道的。到了紧要关头上，他就要脸色发青了。在我看来，这位建筑师仿佛俯身在飞檐上，羞涩地向那粗鲁的住户私语着他的似是而非的真理，实际上住户比他还知道得更多。我现在所看到的建筑学的美，我了解它是从内部向外面渐渐地生长出来的，是从那住在里面的人的需要和他的性格中生长出来的，住在里面的人是唯一的建筑师，——美来自他的不知不觉的真实感和崇高心灵，至于外表他一点儿没有想到；这样的美如果必然产生的话，那他先已不知不觉地有了生命之美。在我们这国土上，画家们都知道，最有趣味的住宅一般是穷困的平民们的那些毫无虚饰的、卑微的木屋和农舍；使房屋显得别致的，不是仅仅在外表上有的哪种特性，而是外壳似的房屋里面的居民生活；同样有趣味的，要算市民们那些郊外的箱形的木屋，他们的生活将是简单的，恰如想象的一样，他们的住宅就没有一点叫人伤脑筋的风格。建筑上的大多数装饰确实是空空洞洞的，一阵九月的风可以把它们吹掉，好比吹落借来的羽毛一样，丝毫无损于实际。并不要在地窖中窖藏橄榄和美酒的人，建筑学也可以过得去。如果在文学作品中，也这样多事地追求装饰风，如果我们的《圣经》的建筑师，也像教堂的建筑师这样花很多的时间在飞檐上，结果会怎样呢？那些纯文学、那些艺术学和它们的教授们就是如此矫揉造作的。当然，人很关心这几根木棍子是斜放在他上面呢，还是放在下面，他的箱子应该涂上什么颜色。这里头是很有一点意思的，如果认真他说，他把它们斜放了，箱子徐上颜色了；可是在精神已经离开了躯壳的情况下，那它跟建造他自己的棺材就属于同一性质了——说的是坟墓的建筑学，——而“木匠”只不过是“做棺材的人”的另一个名称罢了。有一个人说，你在失望中，或者对人生采取漠然态度时，抓起脚下的一把泥土来，就用这颜色来粉刷你的房子吧。他想到了他那临终的狭长的房子了吗？抛一个铜币来抉择一下好了。他一定有非常多的闲暇！为什么你要抓起一把泥土来呢？还是用你自己的皮肤颜色来粉刷你的房屋好得多；让它颜色苍白或者为你羞红好了。一个改进村屋建筑风格的创造！等到你找出了我的装饰来，我一定采用它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a lifetime at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually. If I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is that I brag for humanity rather than for myself; and my shortcomings and inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement. Notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy -- chaff which I find it difficult to separate from my wheat, but for which I am as sorry as any man -- I will breathe freely and stretch myself in this respect, it is such a relief to both the moral and physical system; and I am resolved that I will not through humility become the devil's attorney. I will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the mere rent of a student's room, which is only a little larger than my own, is thirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the advantage of building thirty-two side by side and under one roof, and the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the fourth story. I cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these respects, not only less education would be needed, because, forsooth, more would already have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a great measure vanish. Those conveniences which the student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides. Those things for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made. The mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get up a subscription of dollars and cents, and then, following blindly the principles of a division of labor to its extreme -- a principle which should never be followed but with circumspection -- to call in a contractor who makes this a subject of speculation, and he employs Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations, while the students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay. I think that it would be better than this, for the students, or those who desire to be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure fruitful. "But," says one, "you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?" I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not play life, or study it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed and practised but the art of life;-- to survey the world through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month -- the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this -- or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rodgers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers?…To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied navigation!-- why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should have known more about it.

<div class="line_cn" title="这样我发现，只住宿舍的学生完全能够得到一座终身受用的房子，所花的费用还不比他现在每年付的住宿费大呢，如果说，我似乎夸大得有点过甚其辞，那未我的解释是我并非为自己，是为人类而夸大；我的短处和前后不一致并不能影响我言论的真实性，尽管我有不少虚假和伪善的地方——那好像是难于从麦子上打掉的糠秕，我也跟任何人一样为此感到遗憾，——我还是要自由地呼吸，在这件事上挺起我的腰杆子来，这对于品德和身体都是一个极大的快乐；而且我决定，决不屈辱地变成魔鬼的代言人，我要试着为真理一句好话。在剑桥学院，一个学生住比我那房稍大一点儿的房间，光住宿费就是每年三十元，那家公司却在一个屋顶下造了毗连的三十二个房间，占尽了便宜，房客却因邻居众多而嘈杂，也许还不得不住在四层楼上，因而深感不便。我就不得不想着，如果我们在这些方面有更多的真知的见，不仅教育的需要可以减少，因为更多的教育工作早就可以完成了，而且为了受教育而必需有钱交费那样的事情一定已经大部分都消灭掉了。学生在剑桥或别的学校为了必需有的便利，花掉了他或别人的很大的生命代价，如果双方都合理地处置这一类事情，那只消花十分之一就够了。要收费的东西，决不是学生最需要的东西。例如，学费在这一学期的账目中是一笔大的支出，而他和同时代人中最有教养的人往来，并从中得到更有价值得多的教育，这却不需要付费。成立一个学院的方式，通常是弄到一批捐款的人，捐来大洋和角子，然后盲目地遵从分工的原则，分工分得到了家，这个原则实在是非得审慎从事不可的，——于是招揽了一个承办大工程的包工来，他又雇用了爱尔兰人或别的什么工人，而后果真奠基开工了，然后，学生们得适应在这里面住；而为了这一个失策，一代代的予弟就得付出学费。我想，学生或那些想从学校中得益的人，如果能自己来奠基动工，事情就会好得多。学生得到了他贪求的空闲与休息，他们根据制度，逃避了人类必需的任何劳动，得到的只是可耻的、无益的空闲，而能使这种空闲变为丰富收获的那种经验，他们却全没有学到。“可是，”有人说，“你总不是主张学生不该用脑，而是应该用手去学习吧？”我不完全是这样的主张，我主张的东西他应该多想一想；我主张他们不应该以生活为游戏，或仅仅以生活作研究，还要人类社会花高代价供养他们，他们应该自始至终，热忱地生活。除非青年人立刻进行生活的实践，他们怎能有更好方法来学习生活呢？我想这样做才可以像数学一样训练他们的心智。举例以明之。如果我希望一个孩子懂得一些科学文化，我就不愿意走老路子，那不过是把他送到附近的教授那儿去，那里什么都教，什么都练习，只是不教生活的艺术也不练习生活的艺术；——只是从望远镜或显微镜中考察世界，却从不教授他用肉眼来观看；研究了化学，却不去学习他的面包如何做成，或者什么工艺，也不学如何挣来这一切的，虽然发现了海王星的卫星，却没有发现自己眼睛里的微尘，更没有发现自己成了哪一个流浪汉的卫星；他在一滴醋里观察怪物，却要被他四周那些怪物吞噬。一个孩子要是自己开挖出铁矿石来，自己熔炼它们，把他所需要知道的都从书本上找，然后他做成了一把他自己的折刀——另一个孩子则一方面在冶金学院里听讲冶炼的技术课，一方面收到他父亲给他的一把洛杰斯牌子的折刀，——试想过一个月之后，哪一个孩子进步得更快？又是哪一个孩子会给折刀割破了手的呢？……真叫我吃惊，我离开大学的时候，说是我已经学过航海学了！——其实，只要我到港口去打一个转身，我就会学到更多这方面的知识。甚至贫困的学生也学了，并且只被教授以经济学，而生活的经济学，那是哲学的同义语，甚至没有在我们的学院中认真地教授过。结果弄成了这个局面，因儿子在研究亚当·斯密，李嘉图和萨伊，父亲却陷入了无法摆脱的债务中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As with our colleges, so with a hundred "modern improvements"; there is an illusion about them; there is not always a positive advance. The devil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his early share and numerous succeeding investments in them. Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate. Either is in such a predicament as the man who was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman, but when he was presented, and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his hand, had nothing to say. As if the main object were to talk fast and not to talk sensibly. We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the Old World some weeks nearer to the New; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough. After all, the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages; he is not an evangelist, nor does he come round eating locusts and wild honey.

<div class="line_en">One says to me, "I wonder that you do not lay up money; you love to travel; you might take the cars and go to Fitchburg today and see the country." But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who will get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety cents. That is almost a day's wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot, and get there before night; I have travelled at that rate by the week together. You will in the meanwhile have earned your fare, and arrive there some time tomorrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day. And so, if the railroad reached round the world, I think that I should keep ahead of you; and as for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind, I should have to cut your acquaintance altogether.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time, and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor shouts "All aboard!" when the smoke is blown away and the vapor condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest are run over -- and it will be called, and will be, "A melancholy accident." No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their elasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best part of one's life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable part of it reminds me of the Englishman who went to India to make a fortune first, in order that he might return to England and live the life of a poet. He should have gone up garret at once. "What!" exclaim a million Irishmen starting up from all the shanties in the land, "is not this railroad which we have built a good thing?" Yes, I answer, comparatively good, that is, you might have done worse; but I wish, as you are brothers of mine, that you could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars by some honest and agreeable method, in order to meet my unusual expenses, I planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans, but also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to pines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was "good for nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on." I put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but merely a squatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe it all once. I got out several cords of stumps in plowing, which supplied me with fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans there. The dead and for the most part unmerchantable wood behind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the plowing, though I held the plow myself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for implements, seed, work, etc., $14.72-1/2. The seed corn was given me. This never costs anything to speak of, unless you plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn.

I desire to speak impartially on this point, and as one not interested in the success or failure of the present economical and social arrangements.

<div class="line_en">I am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are the keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and oxen exchange work; but if we consider necessary work only, the oxen will be seen to have greatly the advantage, their farm is so much the larger. Man does some of his part of the exchange work in his six weeks of haying, and it is no boy's play. Certainly no nation that lived simply in all respects, that is, no nation of philosophers, would commit so great a blunder as to use the labor of animals. True, there never was and is not likely soon to be a nation of philosophers, nor am I certain it is desirable that there should be. However, I should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work he might do for me, for fear I should become a horseman or a herdsman merely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we certain that what is one man's gain is not another's loss, and that the stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Granted that some public works would not have been constructed without this aid, and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it follow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy of himself in that case? When men begin to do, not merely unnecessary or artistic, but luxurious and idle work, with their assistance, it is inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen, or, in other words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only works for the animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works for the animal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone, the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the degree to which the barn overshadows the house. This town is said to have the largest houses for oxen, cows, and horses hereabouts, and it is not behindhand in its public buildings; but there are very few halls for free worship or free speech in this county. It should not be by their architecture, but why not even by their power of abstract thought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves? How much more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers and temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind does not toil at the bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to any emperor, nor is its material silver, or gold, or marble, except to a trifling extent. To what end, pray, is so much stone hammered? In Arcadia, when I was there, I did not see any hammering stone. Nations are possessed with an insane ambition to perpetuate the memory of themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave. What if equal pains were taken to smooth and polish their manners? One piece of good sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I love better to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a vulgar grandeur. More sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest man's field than a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from the true end of life. The religion and civilization which are barbaric and heathenish build splendid temples; but what you might call Christianity does not. Most of the stone a nation hammers goes toward its tomb only. It buries itself alive. As for the Pyramids, there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs. I might possibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for it. As for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the same all the world over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or the United States Bank. It costs more than it comes to. The mainspring is vanity, assisted by the love of garlic and bread and butter. Mr. Balcom, a promising young architect, designs it on the back of his Vitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and the job is let out to Dobson &amp; Sons, stonecutters. When the thirty centuries begin to look down on it, mankind begin to look up at it. As for your high towers and monuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook to dig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the Chinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of my way to admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the monuments of the West and the East -- to know who built them. For my part, I should like to know who in those days did not build them -- who were above such trifling. But to proceed with my statistics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我常想，不是人在放牛，简直是牛在牧入，而人放牛是更自由的。人与牛是在交换劳动，如果我们考虑的只是必须劳动的话，那末看来牛要占便宜得多，它们的农场也大得多。人担任的一部分交换劳动便是割上六个星期的干草，这可不是儿戏呢。自然没有一个在各方面的生活都很简单的国土，就是说，没有一个哲学家的国土，是愿意犯这种重大错误来叫畜生劳动的。确实世上从未有过，将来也未见得会有那么个哲学家的国土，就是有了，我也不敢说它一定是美满的。然而我绝对不愿意去驯一匹马或一头牛，束缚了它，叫它替我做任何它能做的工作，只因为我怕自己变成了马夫或牛倌；如果说这样了，社会就得益非浅，那未难道能够肯定一个人的盈利就不是另一个人的损失，难道能够肯定马房里的马夫跟他的主人是同样地满足的吗？就算有些公共的工作没有牛马的帮助是建立不起来的，而且就让人类来和牛马一起分享这种光荣；是否能推理说，那样的话，他就不可能用更加对得起自己的方式来完成这种工作了呢？当人们利用了牛马帮助，开始做了许多不仅是不需要的和艺术的，而且还是奢侈的和无用的工作，这就不可避免的要有少数人得和牛马做交换工作，换句话说，这些人便成了最强者的奴隶。所以，人不仅为他内心的兽性而工作，而且，这像是一个象征，他还为他身外的牲畜而劳动。虽然我们已经有了许多砖瓦或石头砌造的屋子，一个农夫的殷实与否，还得看看他的兽厩在什么程度上盖过了他的住屋。据说城市里有最大的房屋，供给这儿的耕牛、奶牛和马匹居住；公共大厦这一方面毫不落后；可是在这个县里，可供言论自由与信仰自由用的大厅反倒很少呢。国家不应该用高楼大厦来给它们自己树立起纪念碑，为什么不用抽象的思维力来纪念呢？东方的全部废墟，也决不比一卷《对话录》更可赞叹！高塔与寺院是帝王的糜侈。一个单纯而独立的心智决不会听从帝王的吩咐去干苦活的。天才决不是任何帝王的侍从，金子银子和大理石也无法使他们留芳百世，它们最多只能保留极细微的一部分。请告诉我，锤打这么多石头，要达到什么目的呢？当我在阿卡狄亚的时候，我没有看到任何人雕琢大理石。许多国家沉迷在疯狂的野心中，要想靠留下多少雕琢过的石头来使它们自己永垂不朽。如果他们用同样的劳力来琢凿自己的风度，那会怎么样呢？一件有理性的事情，要比矗立一个高得碰到月球的纪念碑还更加值得留传。我更喜欢让石头放在它们原来的地方。像底比斯那样的宏伟是庸俗的。一座有一百个城门的底比斯城早就远离了人生的真正目标，怎能有围绕着诚实人的田园的一平方杆的石墙那么合理呢。野蛮的、异教徒的宗教和文化倒建造了华丽的寺院；而可以称之为教的，就没有这样做。一个国家锤击下来的石头大都用在它的坟墓上。它活埋了它自己。说到金字塔，本没有什么可惊奇的，可惊的是有那么多人，竟能屈辱到如此地步，花了他们一生的精力，替一个鲁钝的野心家造坟墓，其实他要是跳尼罗河淹死，然后把身体喂野狗都还更聪明些，更有气派些呢。我未始不可以给他们，也给他找一些掩饰之词，可是我才没有时间呢。至于那些建筑家所信的宗教和他们对于艺术的爱好，倒是全世界一样的，不管他们造的是埃及的神庙还是美利坚合众国银行。总是代价大于实际。虚荣是源泉，助手是爱大蒜、面包和牛油。一个年轻的有希望的建筑师叫巴尔康先生，他在维特罗微乌斯的后面追随着用硬铅笔和直尺设计了一个图样，然后交到道勃苏父子采石公司手上。当三十个世纪开始俯视着它时，人类抬头向着它凝望。你们的那些高塔和纪念碑呵，城里有过一个疯子要挖掘一条通到中国去的隧道，掘得这样深，据说他已经听到中国茶壶和烧开水的响声了；可是，我想我决不会越出我的常轨而去赞美他的那个窟窿的。许多人关心着东方和西方的那些纪念碑，——要知道是谁造的。我愿意知道，是谁当时不肯造这些东西，——谁能够超越乎这许多烦琐玩意儿之上。可是让我继续统计下去吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These statistics, however accidental and therefore uninstructive they may appear, as they have a certain completeness, have a certain value also. Nothing was given me of which I have not rendered some account. It appears from the above estimate, that my food alone cost me in money about twenty-seven cents a week. It was, for nearly two years after this, rye and Indian meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little salt pork, molasses, and salt; and my drink, water. It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who love so well the philosophy of India. To meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers, I may as well state, that if I dined out occasionally, as I always had done, and I trust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to the detriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I have stated, a constant element, does not in the least affect a comparative statement like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些统计资料，虽然很琐碎，似乎没有什么用处，但因相当完备，也就有了某种价值。再什么我没有记上账簿的了。从上面列的表看来，仅仅是食物一项，每星期要花掉我两角七分。食物，在后来的将近两年之内，总是黑麦和不发酵的印第安玉米粉，土豆，米，少量的腌肉，糖浆和盐；而我的饮料，则是水。对我这样爱好印度哲学的人，用米作为主要的食粮是合适的。为了对付一些习惯于吹毛求疵的人的反对，我还不如说一说，如果我有时跑到外面去吃饭，我以前是这样做的，相信将来还是有机会要到外面去吃饭的，那我这样做是会损害我家里的经济安排的。我已经说了，到外面吃饭是经常的事，对于这样的比较的说法，是一点不发生影响的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I learned from my two years' experience that it would cost incredibly little trouble to obtain one's necessary food, even in this latitude; that a man may use as simple a diet as the animals, and yet retain health and strength. I have made a satisfactory dinner, satisfactory on several accounts, simply off a dish of purslane (Portulaca oleracea) which I gathered in my cornfield, boiled and salted. I give the Latin on account of the savoriness of the trivial name. And pray what more can a reasonable man desire, in peaceful times, in ordinary noons, than a sufficient number of ears of green sweet corn boiled, with the addition of salt? Even the little variety which I used was a yielding to the demands of appetite, and not of health. Yet men have come to such a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries, but for want of luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her son lost his life because he took to drinking water only.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从两年的经验中知道，甚至在这个纬度上，要得到一个人所必需的食粮也极少麻烦，少到不可信的地步；而且一个人可以像动物一样的吃简单的食物，仍然保持康健和膂力。我曾经从玉米田里采了一些马齿苋（学名Portulacaoleracea）煮熟加盐，吃了一餐，这一餐饭在好些方面使我心满意足。我把它的拉丁文的学名写下是因为它的俗名不很好。请说说看，在和平的年代，在日常的中午时分，除了吃一些甜的嫩玉米，加上盐煮，一个讲究理性的人还能希望什么更多的食物呢？就是我稍稍变换花样，也只是为了换换口味，并不是为了健康的缘故。然而人们常常挨饿，不是因为缺少必需品，而是因为缺少了奢侈品；我还认识一个良善的女人，她以为她的儿子送了命是因为他只喝清水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I baked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a stick of timber sawed off in building my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making, consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter, till I came to "good, sweet, wholesome bread," the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the spiritus which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal fire -- some precious bottleful, I suppose, first brought over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land -- this seed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I discovered that even this was not indispensable -- for my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process -- and I have gladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am still in the land of the living; and I am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottleful in my pocket, which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal-soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ. "Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito, aquae paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu." Which I take to mean,—"Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover," that is, in a baking kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of it for more than a month.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起先我用纯粹的印第安玉米粉和盐来焙制面包，纯粹的褥糕，我在露天的火上烤它们，放在一片薄木片上，或者放在建筑房屋时从木料上锯下来的木头上；可是时常熏得有松树味儿。我也试过面粉；可是最后发现了黑麦和印第安玉米粉的合制最方便，最可口。在冷天，这样连续地烘这些小面包是很有趣的事，过细地翻身，像埃及人孵小鸡一样。我烤熟的，正是我的真正的米粮的果实，在我的嗅觉中，它们有如其他的鲜美的果实一样，有一种芳香，我用布把它们包起，尽量要保持这种芳香，越长久越好。我研读了不可缺少的制造面包的古代艺术，向那些权威人物讨教，一直回溯到原始时代，不发酵的面包的第一个发明，那时从吃野果子，啖生肉，人类第一次进步到了吃这一种食物的文雅优美的程度，我慢慢地又在我的读物中，探索到面团突然间发酸，据信就这样，发酵的技术被学到了，然后经过了各种的发酵作用，直到我读到“良好的，甘美的，有益健康的面包”，这生命的支持者。有人认为发酵剂是西包的灵魂，是充填细胞组织的精神，像圣灶上的火焰，被虔诚地保留下，——我想，一定有很珍贵的几瓶是最初由“五月花”带来，为美国担当了这任务的，而它的影响还在这片土地上升腾，膨胀，伸展，似食粮的波涛，——这酵母我也从村中正规地忠诚地端来了，直到有一天早晨，我却忘记了规则，用滚水烫了我的酵母；这件意外事使我甚至酵母也可以避免的，……我发现这个不是用综合的，而是用了分析的方式———从此我快快活活地取消了它，虽然大多数的家庭主妇曾经热忱地劝告我，没有发酵粉，安全而有益健康的面包是不可能的，年老的人还说我的体力会很快就衰退的。然而，我这并不是必需的原料，没有发酵我也过了一年，我还是生活在活人的土地上；我高兴的是我总算用不到在袋子里带一只小瓶子了，有时砰的一声瓶子破碎，里面的东西都倒掉了，弄得我很不愉快，不用这东西更干脆，更高尚了。人这种动物，比起别的动物来，更能够适应各种气候和各种环境。我也没有在面包里放什么盐，苏打，或别的酸素，或碱。看来我是依照了诞生前两个世纪的马尔库斯·鲍尔修斯·卡托的方子做面包的。“Panem depsticium sic facito。 Manus mortariumque bene lavato。 Farinam in mortarium indito， aquae paulatim addito， subigitoque pulchre。 Ubi bene subegeris， defingito， coquitoque sub testu”他的这段话我这样理解：——“这样来做手揉的面包。洗净你的手和长槽。把粗粉放进长槽，慢慢加水，揉得透彻。等你揉好了，使成形，而后盖上盖于烘烤，”——这是说在一只烤面包的炉中。一个字也没有提到发酵。可是我还不能常常用这一类的生命的支持者。有一个时期，囊空如洗，我有一个月之久，都没有看到过面包。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Every New Englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this land of rye and Indian corn, and not depend on distant and fluctuating markets for them. Yet so far are we from simplicity and independence that, in Concord, fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops, and hominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any. For the most part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own producing, and buys flour, which is at least no more wholesome, at a greater cost, at the store. I saw that I could easily raise my bushel or two of rye and Indian corn, for the former will grow on the poorest land, and the latter does not require the best, and grind them in a hand-mill, and so do without rice and pork; and if I must have some concentrated sweet, I found by experiment that I could make a very good molasses either of pumpkins or beets, and I knew that I needed only to set out a few maples to obtain it more easily still, and while these were growing I could use various substitutes beside those which I have named.

For my part, I am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried; as that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard, raw corn on the ear, using his teeth for all mortar.

<div class="line_en">My furniture, part of which I made myself -- and the rest cost me nothing of which I have not rendered an account -- consisted of a bed, a table, a desk, three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and andirons, a kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a wash-bowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp. None is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin. That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty of such chairs as I like best in the village garrets to be had for taking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and I can stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse. What man but a philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly account of empty boxes? That is Spaulding's furniture. I could never tell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so-called rich man or a poor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken. Indeed, the more you have of such things the poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties; and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor. Pray, for what do we move ever but to get rid of our furniture, our exuviæ: at last to go from this world to another newly furnished, and leave this to be burned? It is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a man's belt, and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are cast without dragging them -- dragging his trap. He was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his third leg off to be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he is at a dead set! "Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead set?" If you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he owns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn, and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can. I think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a knot-hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow him. I cannot but feel compassion when I hear some trig, compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready, speak of his "furniture," as whether it is insured or not. "But what shall I do with my furniture?"-- My gay butterfly is entangled in a spider's web then. Even those who seem for a long while not to have any, if you inquire more narrowly you will find have some stored in somebody's barn. I look upon England today as an old gentleman who is travelling with a great deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeeping, which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little trunk, bandbox, and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk, and I should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run. When I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his all -- looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his neck -- I have pitied him, not because that was his all, but because he had all that to carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take care that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part. But perchance it would be wisest never to put one's paw into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的家具，一部分是我自己做的——其余的没花多少钱，但我没有记账——包括一张床，一只桌子，三只凳子，一面直径三英寸的镜子，一把火钳和柴架，一只壶，一只长柄平底锅，一个煎锅，一只勺子，一只洗脸盆，两副刀叉，三只盘，一只杯子，一把调羹、一只油罐，和一只糖浆缸，还有一只上了日本油漆的灯。没有人会穷得只能坐在南瓜上的。那是偷懒的办法。在村中的阁搂上，有好些是我最喜欢的椅子；只要去拿，就属于你了。家具！谢谢天。我可以坐，我可以站，用不到家具公司来帮忙。如果一个人到自己的家具装在车上，曝露在光天化日之下，睽睽众目之前，而且只是一些极不入眼的空箱子，除了哲学家之外，谁会不害羞呢？这是斯波尔亭的家具。看了这些家具，我还无法知道是属于一个所谓阔人的呢，还是属于穷人的；它的主人的模样似乎总是穷相十足的。真的，这东西越多，你越穷。每一车，都好像是十几座棚屋里的东西；一座棚屋如果是很穷的，这就是十二倍地穷困。你说，为什么我们时常搬家，而不是丢掉一些家具，丢掉我们的蛇蜕；离开这个世界，到一个有新家具的世界去，把老家具烧掉呢？这正如一个人把所有陷饼的机关都缚在他的皮带上，他搬家经过我们放着绳子的荒野时，不能不拖动那些绳子，——拖到他自己的陷饼里去了。把断尾巴留在陷阶中的狐狸是十分幸运的。麝鼠为了逃命，宁肯咬断它的第三条腿子。难怪人已失去了灵活性。多少回他走上了一条绝路！“先生，请您恕我唐突，你所谓的绝路是什么意思呢？”如果你是一个善于观察的人，任何时候你遇见一个人，你都能知道他有一些什么东西，嗳，还有他好些装作没有的东西，你甚至能知道他的厨房中的家什以及一切外观华美丽毫不实用的东西，这些东西他却都要留着，不愿意烧掉，他就好像是被挽驾在上面，尽是拖着它们往前走。一个人钻过了一个绳结的口，或过了一道门，而他背面的一车子家具却过不去，这时，我说，这个人是走上一条绝路了。当我听到一个衣冠楚楚、外表结实的人，似乎很自由，似乎他一切都安排得很得当，却说到了他的“家具”，不管是不是保了险，我不能不怜悯他。“我的家具怎么办呢？”我的欢乐的蝴蝶，这就扑进了一只蜘蛛网了。甚至有这样的人，多年来好像并没有家具牵累他似的，但是，如果你仔细地盘问他一下，你就发现在什么人家的棚子底下，也储藏着他的几件家具呢。我看今天的英国，就好像一个老年绅士，带着他的许多行李在旅行着，全是住家住久了以后，积起来的许多华而不实的东西，而他是没有勇气来把它们烧掉的：大箱子，小箱子，手提箱，还有包裹。至少把前面的三种抛掉了吧。现在，就是一个身体康健的人也不会提了他的床铺上路的。我自然要劝告一些害病的人，抛弃他们的床铺，奔跑奔跑。当我碰到一个移民，带着他的全部家产的大包裹，蹒跚前行，——那包裹好像他脖于后头长出来的一个大瘤——我真可怜他，并不因为他只有那么一丁点儿，倒是因为他得带着这一切跑路。如果我必须带着我的陷阱跑路，至少我可以带一个比较轻便的陷阱。机括一发，也不会咬住我最机要的部分。可是，最聪明的办法还是千万不要把自己的手掌放进陷阱。">查看中文翻译</div>

Would it not be well if we were to celebrate such a "busk," or "feast of first fruits," as Bartram describes to have been the custom of the Mucclasse Indians? "When a town celebrates the busk," says he, "having previously provided themselves with new clothes, new pots, pans, and other household utensils and furniture, they collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable things, sweep and cleanse their houses, squares, and the whole town of their filth, which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they cast together into one common heap, and consume it with fire.

<div class="line_en">For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands, and I found that, by working about six weeks in a year, I could meet all the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well as most of my summers, I had free and clear for study. I have thoroughly tried school-keeping, and found that my expenses were in proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my income, for I was obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe, accordingly, and I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the good of my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have tried trade but I found that it would take ten years to get under way in that, and that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I was actually afraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a good business. When formerly I was looking about to see what I could do for a living, some sad experience in conforming to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity, I thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries; that surely I could do, and its small profits might suffice -- for my greatest skill has been to want but little -- so little capital it required, so little distraction from my wonted moods, I foolishly thought. While my acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the professions, I contemplated this occupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick the berries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of them; so, to keep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might gather the wild herbs, or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods, even to the city, by hay-cart loads.

If there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things, and who know how to use them when acquired, I relinquish to them the pursuit. Some are "industrious," and appear to love labor for its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief; to such I have at present nothing to say. Those who would not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice as hard as they do -- work till they pay for themselves, and get their free papers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty days in a year to support one. The laborer's day ends with the going down of the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit, independent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates from month to month, has no respite from one end of the year to the other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Undoubtedly, in this case, what is true for one is truer still for a thousand, as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one, since one roof may cover, one cellar underlie, and one wall separate several apartments. But for my part, I preferred the solitary dwelling. Moreover, it will commonly be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall; and when you have done this, the common partition, to be much cheaper, must be a thin one, and that other may prove a bad neighbor, and also not keep his side in repair. The only co-operation which is commonly possible is exceedingly partial and superficial; and what little true co-operation there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible to men. If a man has faith, he will co-operate with equal faith everywhere; if he has not faith, he will continue to live like the rest of the world, whatever company he is joined to. To co-operate in the highest as well as the lowest sense, means to get our living together. I heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel together over the world, the one without money, earning his means as he went, before the mast and behind the plow, the other carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket. It was easy to see that they could not long be companions or co-operate, since one would not operate at all. They would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures. Above all, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.</div>

I have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among others have sacrificed this pleasure also. There are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of some poor family in the town; and if I had nothing to do -- for the devil finds employment for the idle -- I might try my hand at some such pastime as that. However, when I have thought to indulge myself in this respect, and lay their Heaven under an obligation by maintaining certain poor persons in all respects as comfortably as I maintain myself, and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer, they have one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor. While my townsmen and women are devoted in so many ways to the good of their fellows, I trust that one at least may be spared to other and less humane pursuits. You must have a genius for charity as well as for anything else. As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are full. Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. Probably I should not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which society demands of me, to save the universe from annihilation; and I believe that a like but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it. But I would not stand between any man and his genius; and to him who does this work, which I decline, with his whole heart and soul and life, I would say, Persevere, even if the world call it doing evil, as it is most likely they will.</div>

At doing something -- I will not engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good -- I do not hesitate to say that I should be a capital fellow to hire; but what that is, it is for my employer to find out. What good I do, in the common sense of that word, must be aside from my main path, and for the most part wholly unintended. Men say, practically, Begin where you are and such as you are, without aiming mainly to become of more worth, and with kindness aforethought go about doing good. If I were to preach at all in this strain, I should say rather, Set about being good. As if the sun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the splendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitude, and go about like a Robin Goodfellow, peeping in at every cottage window, inspiring lunatics, and tainting meats, and making darkness visible, instead of steadily increasing his genial heat and beneficence till he is of such brightness that no mortal can look him in the face, and then, and in the meanwhile too, going about the world in his own orbit, doing it good, or rather, as a truer philosophy has discovered, the world going about him getting good. When Phaeton, wishing to prove his heavenly birth by his beneficence, had the sun's chariot but one day, and drove out of the beaten track, he burned several blocks of houses in the lower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth, and dried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at length Jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and the sun, through grief at his death, did not shine for a year.</div>

If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life, as from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should get some of his good done to me -- some of its virus mingled with my blood. No -- in this case I would rather suffer evil the natural way. A man is not a good man to me because he will feed me if I should be starving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or pull me out of a ditch if I should ever fall into one. I can find you a Newfoundland dog that will do as much. Philanthropy is not love for one's fellow-man in the broadest sense. Howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and worthy man in his way, and has his reward; but, comparatively speaking, what are a hundred Howards to us, if their philanthropy do not help us in our best estate, when we are most worthy to be helped? I never heard of a philanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good to me, or the like of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有比善良走了味更坏的气味了。这像人的腐尸或神的腐尸臭味一样。如果我确实知道有人要到我家里来，存心要给我做好事，我就要逃命了，好像我要逃出非洲沙漠中的所谓西蒙风的狂风，它的沙粒塞满了你的嘴巴、耳朵、鼻子和眼睛，直到把你闷死为止，因为我就怕他做的好事做到了我身上，——他的毒素混入我的血液中。不行，——要是如此，我倒宁可忍受人家在我身上干的坏事，那倒来得自然些。如果我饥饿，而他喂饱了我，如果我寒冷，而他暖和了我，如果我掉在沟中，而他拉起了我，这个人不算好人。我可以找一条纽芬兰的狗给你看，这些它都得到。慈善并不是那种爱同胞的广义的爱。霍华德固然从他本人那方面来说无疑是很卓越的，很了不起的，且已善有善报了；可是，比较他说来，如果霍华德们的慈善事业，慈善不到我们已经拥有最好的产业的人身上，那末，在我们最值得接受帮助的时候，一百个霍华德对于我们又有什么用处？我从没有听到过任何一个慈善大会曾诚诚恳恳提议过要向我，或向我这样的一些人，来行善做好事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Jesuits were quite balked by those Indians who, being burned at the stake, suggested new modes of torture to their tormentors. Being superior to physical suffering, it sometimes chanced that they were superior to any consolation which the missionaries could offer; and the law to do as you would be done by fell with less persuasiveness on the ears of those who, for their part, did not care how they were done by, who loved their enemies after a new fashion, and came very near freely forgiving them all they did.</div>

<div class="line_en">Be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be your example which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend yourself with it, and do not merely abandon it to them. We make curious mistakes sometimes. Often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely his misfortune. If you give him money, he will perhaps buy more rags with it. I was wont to pity the clumsy Irish laborers who cut ice on the pond, in such mean and ragged clothes, while I shivered in my more tidy and somewhat more fashionable garments, till, one bitter cold day, one who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm him, and I saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings ere he got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it is true, and that he could afford to refuse the extra garments which I offered him, he had so many intra ones. This ducking was the very thing he needed. Then I began to pity myself, and I saw that it would be a greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slop-shop on him. There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to relieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of every tenth slave to buy a Sunday's liberty for the rest. Some show their kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they not be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending a tenth part of your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine tenths so, and done with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the property then. Is this owing to the generosity of him in whose possession it is found, or to the remissness of the officers of justice?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你一定要给穷人以他们最需要的帮助，虽然他们落在你的后面本是你的造孽。如果你施舍了钱给他们，你应该自己陪同他们花掉这笔钱，不要扔他们就算了。我们有时候犯很奇怪的错误。往往是那个穷人，邋遢、褴楼又粗野，但并没有冻馁之忧，他并不怎么不幸，他往往还乐此不疲呢。你要是给了他钱，他也许就去买更多褴褛的衣服。我常常怜悯那些穷相十足的爱尔兰工人，在湖上挖冰，穿得这样褴褛，这样贫贱，而我穿的是干净的似乎是比较合时的衣服）却还冷得发抖呢，直到有一个严寒的冷天，一个掉进了冰里的人来到我的屋中取暖，我看他脱下了三条裤子和两双袜子才见到皮肤，虽然裤子袜子破敝不堪，这是真的，可是他拒绝了我将要献呈于他的额外衣服，因为他有着这许多的里面衣服。活该他落水的了。于是我开始可怜我自己，要是给我一件法兰绒衬衫，那就比给他一座旧衣铺子慈善得多。一千人在砍着罪恶的树枝，只有一个人砍伐了罪恶的根，说不定那个把时间和金钱在穷人身上花得最多的人，正是在用他那种生活方式引起最多的贫困与不幸，现在他却在徒然努力于挽救之道。正是道貌岸然的蓄奴主，拿奴隶生产的利息的十分之一，其余的奴隶星期日的自由。有人为表示对穷人赐恩而叫他到厨房去工作。为什么他们自己不下厨房工作，这不是更慈悲了吗？你吹牛说，你的收入的十分之一捐给慈善事业了，也许你应该捐出十分之九，就此结束。那未，社会收回的只是十分之一的财富。这是由于占有者的慷慨呢，还是由于持正义者的疏忽呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind. Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our selfishness which overrates it. A robust poor man, one sunny day here in Concord, praised a fellow-townsman to me, because, as he said, he was kind to the poor; meaning himself. The kind uncles and aunts of the race are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers. I once heard a reverend lecturer on England, a man of learning and intelligence, after enumerating her scientific, literary, and political worthies, Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and others, speak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession required it of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the greatest of the great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one must feel the falsehood and cant of this. The last were not England's best men and women; only, perhaps, her best philanthropists.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慈善几乎可以说是人类能够赞许的唯一美德。不然，它是被捧上了天的；是因为我们自私，所以它捧上了天的。一个粗壮的穷人，在日暖风和的一天，在康科德这里，对我赞扬一个市民，因为，他说，那人对像他这样的穷人很善良。人种中的善良的伯父伯母，反而比真正的灵魂上的父母更受颂扬。有一次我听一个宗教演讲家讲英国，他是一个有学问有才智的人，数说着英国的科学家，文艺家和家，莎士比亚，倍根，克伦威尔，密尔顿，牛顿和别个，跟着就说起英国的教英雄来了，好像他的职业一定要求他这样说似的，他把这些英雄提高到所有其他人物之上，称之为伟大人物中的尤伟大者。他们便是潘恩，霍华德，福莱夫人。人人都一定会觉得他在胡说八道。最后三人并不是最好的英国人，也许他们只能算作英国最好的慈善家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would not subtract anything from the praise that is due to philanthropy, but merely demand justice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to mankind. I do not value chiefly a man's uprightness and benevolence, which are, as it were, his stem and leaves. Those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea for the sick serve but a humble use, and are most employed by quacks. I want the flower and fruit of a man; that some fragrance be wafted over from him to me, and some ripeness flavor our intercourse. His goodness must not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant superfluity, which costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a charity that hides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often surrounds mankind with the remembrance of his own castoff griefs as an atmosphere, and calls it sympathy. We should impart our courage, and not our despair, our health and ease, and not our disease, and take care that this does not spread by contagion. From what southern plains comes up the voice of wailing? Under what latitudes reside the heathen to whom we would send light? Who is that intemperate and brutal man whom we would redeem? If anything ail a man, so that he does not perform his functions, if he have a pain in his bowels even -- for that is the seat of sympathy -- he forthwith sets about reforming -- the world. Being a microcosm himself, he discovers -- and it is a true discovery, and he is the man to make it -- that the world has been eating green apples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green apple, which there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will nibble before it is ripe; and straightway his drastic philanthropy seeks out the Esquimau and the Patagonian, and embraces the populous Indian and Chinese villages; and thus, by a few years of philanthropic activity, the powers in the meanwhile using him for their own ends, no doubt, he cures himself of his dyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint blush on one or both of its cheeks, as if it were beginning to be ripe, and life loses its crudity and is once more sweet and wholesome to live. I never dreamed of any enormity greater than I have committed. I never knew, and never shall know, a worse man than myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我并不要从慈善应得的赞美中减去什么，我只要求公平，对一切有利于人类的生命与工作应一视同仁。我不以为一个人的正直和慈善是主要的价值，它们不过是他的枝枝叶叶。那种枝叶，褪去了叶绿素，做成了药茶给病人喝，就是它有了一些卑微的用处，多数是走四方的郎中用它们。我要的是人中的花朵和果实；让他的芬芳传送给我，让他的成熟的馨香在我们交接中熏陶我。他的良善不能是局部的、短暂的行为，而是常持的富足有余，他的施与于他无损，于他自己，也无所知。这是一种将万恶隐藏起来的慈善。慈善家经常记着他要用自己散发出来的那种颓唐悲戚的气氛，来绕住人类，美其名曰同情心。我们应该传播给人类的是我们的勇气而不是我们的失望，是我们的健康与舒泰，而不是我们的病容，可得小心别传染了疾病。从哪一个南方的平原上，升起了一片哀号声？在什么纬度上，住着我们应该去播送光明的异教徒？谁是那我们应该去挽救的纵欲无度的残暴的人？如果有人得病了，以致不能做他的事，如果他肠痛了，——这很值得同情———他慈善家就要致力于改良——这个世界了。他是大千世界里的一个缩影，他发现，这是一个真正的发现，而且是他发现的，——世界在吃着青苹果；在他的眼中，地球本身便是一只庞大的青苹果，想起来这却很可怕，人类的孩子如果在苹果还没有成熟的时候就去噬食它，那是很危险的；可是他那狂暴的慈善事业使他径直去找了爱斯基摩人、巴塔哥尼亚人，还拥抱了人口众多的印度和中国的村落；就这样由于他几年的慈善活动，有权有势者还利用了他达到他们的目的，无疑他治好了自己的消化不良症，地球的一颊或双颊也染上了红晕，好像它开始成熟起来了，而生命也失去了它的粗野，再一次变得又新鲜又健康，更值得生活了。我从没有梦见过比我自己所犯的更大的罪过。我从来没有见过，将来也不会见到一个比我自己更坏的人了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with his fellows in distress, but, though he be the holiest son of God, is his private ail. Let this be righted, let the spring come to him, the morning rise over his couch, and he will forsake his generous companions without apology. My excuse for not lecturing against the use of tobacco is, that I never chewed it, that is a penalty which reformed tobacco-chewers have to pay; though there are things enough I have chewed which I could lecture against. If you should ever be betrayed into any of these philanthropies, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does, for it is not worth knowing. Rescue the drowning and tie your shoestrings. Take your time, and set about some free labor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints. Our hymn-books resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring Him forever. One would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the fears than confirmed the hopes of man. There is nowhere recorded a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life, any memorable praise of God. All health and success does me good, however far off and withdrawn it may appear; all disease and failure helps to make me sad and does me evil, however much sympathy it may have with me or I with it. If, then, we would indeed restore mankind by truly Indian, botanic, magnetic, or natural means, let us first be as simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang over our own brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to be an overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world.</div>

He replied, Each has its appropriate produce, and appointed season, during the continuance of which it is fresh and blooming, and during their absence dry and withered; to neither of which states is the cypress exposed, being always flourishing; and of this nature are the azads, or religious independents.-- Fix not thy heart on that which is transitory; for the Dijlah, or Tigris, will continue to flow through Bagdad after the race of caliphs is extinct: if thy hand has plenty, be liberal as the date tree; but if it affords nothing to give away, be an azad, or free man, like the cypress."</div>
