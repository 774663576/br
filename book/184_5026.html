<div class="line_en">The others admitted afterwards that Jill had been wonderful that day. As soon as the King and the rest of the hunting party had set off, she began making a tour of the whole castle and asking questions, but all in such an innocent, babyish way that no one could suspect her of any secret design. Though her tongue was never still, you could hardly say she talked: she prattled and giggled. She made love to everyone -- the grooms, the porters, the housemaids, the ladies-in-waiting, and the elderly giant lords whose hunting days were past. She submitted to being kissed and pawed about by any number of giantesses, many of whom seemed sorry for her and called her "a poor little thing" though none of them explained why. She made especial friends with the cook and discovered the all-important fact there was a scullery door which let you out through the outer wall, so that you did not have to cross the courtyard or pass the great gatehouse. In the kitchen she pretended to be greedy, and ate all sorts of scraps which the cook and scullions delighted to give her. But upstairs among the ladies she asked questions about how she would be dressed for the great feast, and how long she would be allowed to sit up, and whether she would dance with some very, very small giant. And then (it made her hot all over when she remembered it afterwards) she would put her head on one side in an idiotic fashion which grown-ups, giant and otherwise, thought very fetching, and shake her curls, and fidget, and say, "Oh, I do wish it was tomorrow night, don't you? Do you think the time will go quickly till then?" And all the giantesses said she was a perfect little darling; and some of them dabbed their eyes with enormous handkerchiefs as if they were going to cry.</div>

<div class="line_en">At lunchtime something happened which made all three of them more anxious than ever to leave the castle of the Gentle Giants. They had lunch in the great hall at a little table of their own, near the fireplace. At a bigger table, about twenty yards away, half a dozen old giants were lunching. Their conversation was so noisy, and so high up in the air, that the children soon took no more notice of it than you would of hooters outside the window or traffic noises in the street. They were eating cold venison, a kind of food which Jill had never tasted before, and she was liking it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午饭时又出了件事，使他们三个格外急着要离开斯文巨人的城堡了。他们在大厅里靠近火炉的地方一张小桌上用餐。大约二十码以外，在一张大桌子旁边，坐着六个老巨人也在用餐。他们说话声音那么吵，那么响，两个孩子一下子就不去注意这些话了，正像你对窗外的汽笛声和街上交通往来的声音也不注意一样。他们正在吃冷的鹿肉，这是吉尔以前从来没吃过的食品，她倒很喜欢吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

Jill, who was new to that world, was sorry for the poor stag and thought it rotten of the giants to have killed him. Scrubb, who had been in that world before and had at least one Talking beast as his dear friend, felt horrified; as you might feel about a murder. But Puddleglum, who was Narnian born, was sick and faint, and felt as you would feel if you found you had eaten a baby.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was now drawing near to that time of the day on which their hopes of escape depended, and all became nervous. They hung about in passages and waited for things to become quiet. The giants in the hall sat on a dreadfully long time after the meal was over. The bald one was telling a story. When that was over, the three travellers dawdled down to the kitchen. But there were still plenty of giants there, or at least in the scullery, washing up and putting things away. It was agonizing, waiting till these finished their jobs and, one by one, wiped their hands and went away. At last only one old giantess was left in the room. She pottered about, and pottered about, and at last the three travellers realized with horror that she did not intend to go away at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在决定他们逃跑希望成败的时间快到了，大家都变得很紧张。他们在过道里闲逛，等着周围静下来。大厅里的巨人吃完饭还坐了很长时间。一个秃顶巨人正在讲故事。等故事讲完，他们三个又混到厨房里。但那儿仍然有好多巨人，至少在洗碗间里有好多人，洗洗涮涮，收拾东西。等着这些人干完活，一个一个擦擦手走开，真是件极其痛苦的事。最后厨房里只留下一个上了年纪的女巨人了。她东走走，西逛逛，他们三个终于厌恶地明白她根本就没打算走。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Don't try it till we're sure she's really asleep," whispered Scrubb. "Or it'll spoil everything." So they all huddled at the kitchen end, waiting and watching.

Just in front of her was a clean wide table with two clean pie-dishes on it, and an open book. They were giant pie-dishes of course. Jill thought that she could lie down just comfortably in one of them. Then she climbed up on the bench beside the table to look at the book. She read:</div>

<div class="line_en">MARSH-WIGGLE. Some authorities reject this animal altogether as unfit for giants' consumption because of its stringy consistency and muddy flavour. The flavour can, however, be greatly reduced if Jill touched his feet, and Scrubb's, gently. All three looked back at the giantess. Her mouth was slightly open and from her nose there came a sound which at that moment was more welcome to them than any music; she snored. And now it was a question of tiptoe work, not daring to go too fast, hardly daring to breathe, out through the scullery (giant sculleries smell horrid), out at last into the pale sunlight of a winter afternoon.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were at the top of a rough little path which ran steeply down. And, thank heavens, on the right side of the castle; the City Ruinous was in sight. In a few minutes they were back on the broad, steep road which led down from the main gate of the castle. They were also in full view from every single window on that side. If it had been one, or two, or five windows there'd be a reasonable chance that no one might be looking out. But there were nearer fifty than five. They now realized, too, that the road on which they were, and indeed all the ground between them and the City Ruinous, didn't offer as much cover as would hide a fox; it was all coarse grass and pebbles and flat stones. To make matters worse, they were now in the clothes that the giants had provided for them last night: except Puddleglum, whom nothing would fit. Jill wore a vivid green robe, rather too long for her, and over that a scarlet mantle fringed with white fur. Scrubb had scarlet stockings, blue tunic and cloak, a gold-hilted sword, and a feathered bonnet.</div>

<div class="line_en">But she didn't think about that. She was like a hunted animal now; as long as the pack was after her, she must run till she dropped.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Marsh-wiggle was ahead. As he came to the lowest step he stopped, looked a little to his right, and all of a sudden darted into a little hole or crevice at the bottom of it. His long legs, disappearing into it, looked very like those of a spider. Scrubb hesitated and then vanished after him. Jill, breathless and reeling, came to the place about a minute later. It was an unattractive hole -- a crack between the earth and the stone about three feet long and hardly more than a foot high. You had to fling yourself flat on your face and crawl in. You couldn't do it so very quickly either. She felt sure that a dog's teeth would close on her heel before she had got inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沼泽怪跑在前面。它刚到底下一级石阶就停下了，朝稍右一点地方看看，突然冲进石阶底部的一个小洞或是裂缝里去了。它的长腿一下就看不见了，看上去真像一只蜘蛛。斯克罗布犹疑了一下，接着跟在它后头也不见人影了。吉尔气喘吁吁，摇摇晃晃，过一会儿也到了这个地方。这洞一点也不起眼——只是泥地和石头之间的一条裂缝罢了。大约有三英尺长，不到一英尺高。你得扑在地上爬进去。你也不能爬得最快。她确信自己还没爬到洞里，狗就会来咬住她了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quick, quick. Stones. Fill up the opening," came Puddleglum's voice in the darkness beside her. It was pitch black in there, except for the grey light in the opening by which they had crawled in. The other two were working hard. She could see Scrubb's small hands and the Marshwiggle's big, frog-like hands black against the light, working desperately to pile up stones. Then she realized how important this was and began groping for large stones herself, and handing them to the others. Before the dogs were baying and yelping at the cave mouth, they had it pretty well filled; and now, of course, there was no light at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快，快，石头，把口子堵上。”普德格伦的声音从她身边暗处传来。除了他们爬进来的那条裂缝有点灰蒙蒙的光，里面是一片漆黑。另外两个正在大忙特忙。她看得见斯克罗布那双小手和沼泽怪那双像青蛙爪子的大于，背着光看上去黑乎乎的，正在拼命堆石头。这时她才明白这有多么重要，自己也开始摸着找大石头，递给另外两个。他们总算赶在猎狗到洞口狂吠之前把洞堵得严严实实。眼前，他们当然一点也没亮光了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good idea," said Scrubb. But it took them quite a long time to find one another's hands in the darkness. The dogs were sniffing at the other side of the barrier now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好主意。”斯克罗布说。但黑暗中要寻找彼此的手也费了好长时间。猎狗这会儿正在石垒那一边嗅气味呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Try if we can stand up," suggested Scrubb. They did and found that they could. Then, Puddleglum holding out a hand behind him to Scrubb, and Scrubb holding a hand out behind him to Jill (who wished very much that she was the middle one of the party and not the last), they began groping with their feet and stumbling forwards into the blackness. It was all loose stones underfoot. Then Puddleglum came up to a wall of rock. They turned a little to their right and went on. There were a good many more twists and turns. Jill had now no sense of direction at all, and no idea where the mouth of the cave lay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“试试看能不能站起来？”斯克罗布建议道。他们试了，发现他们能站起来。接着，普德格伦伸出一只手从后面拉着斯克罗布，斯克罗布伸出一只手从后面拉着吉尔（她真希望她站在他俩中间而不是最后），他们开始用脚探着路，在黑暗中跌跌撞撞往前走。脚下全是松散的石头。后来普德格伦走到一堵石墙前面。他们稍稍往右拐，继续走下去。那儿有好多弯道和拐角。吉尔已经根本不辨方向，也不知道洞口在什么地方了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The question is," came Puddleglum's voice out of the darkness ahead, "whether, taking one thing with another, it wouldn't be better to go back (if we can) and give the giants a treat at that feast of theirs, instead of losing our way in the guts of a hill where, ten to one, there's dragons and deep holes and gases and water and -- Ow! Let go! Save yourselves. I'm --"</div>

<div class="line_en">After that all happened quickly. There was a wild cry, a swishing, dusty, gravelly noise, a rattle of stones, and Jill found herself sliding, sliding, hopelessly sliding, and sliding quicker every moment down a slope that grew steeper every moment. It was not a smooth, firm slope, but a slope of small stones and rubbish. Even if you could have stood up, it would have been no use. Any bit of that slope you had put your foot on would have slid away from under you and carried you down with it. But Jill was more lying than standing. And the farther they all slid, the more they disturbed all the stones and earth, so that the general downward rush of everything (including themselves) got faster and louder and dustier and dirtier. From the sharp cries and swearing of the other two, Jill got the idea that many of the stones which she was dislodging were hitting Scrubb and Puddleglum pretty hard. And now she was going at a furious rate and felt sure she would be broken to bits at the bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说时迟，那时快，一下子只听得一声狂叫，一阵沙喇喇、哗嚓嚓的声音，石头骨碌碌滚动。吉尔只觉得自己在滑下去，滑下去，毫无希望地滑下去，每滑下一个越来越陡的斜坡，就滑得更快。这不是一种光滑、结实的斜坡，而是小石子和碎屑的斜坡。即使你能站起来也没用。你踩住斜坡任何一片地方，都会从脚下滑掉把你拖下去。但吉尔与其说是站着，不如说是躺着。他们滑得越远，越是把所有的石头和泥土都搅乱了，搅得一切都一齐往下冲（也包括他们自己），冲势越来越快，越来越响，越来越尘土飞扬，越来越脏。从另外两个的尖声叫喊和骂声里，吉尔知道她踩掉的石头有好多重重砸在斯克罗布和普德格伦身上。目前她正以飞快速度滑下去，她确信自己掉到底下时准会粉身碎骨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet somehow they weren't. They were a mass of bruises, and the wet sticky stuff on her face appeared to be blood. And such a mass of loose earth, shingle, and larger stones was piled up round her (and partly over her) that she couldn't get up. The darkness was so complete that it made no difference at all whether you had your eyes open or shut. There was no noise. And that was the very worst moment Jill had ever known in her life. Supposing she was alone: supposing the others… Then she heard movements around her. And presently all three, in shaken voices, were explaining that none of them seemed to have any broken bones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而不知怎么的，他们并没粉身碎骨。他们摔得全都青一块，紫一块的，她脸上那又湿又季占的东西好像是血。那么大一堆碎土、砂石和大石块都堆在她周围（有些还高过她），使她没法站起来。这儿黑咕隆咚，睁着眼闭着眼都一样。一点声音也没有。这真是吉尔一生中最最糟糕的时刻。假定只有她一个人，假定别人……这时她听见身边有动静。不久，他们三个，声音哆嗦地都在说看来他们谁也没有摔断骨头。">查看中文翻译</div>
