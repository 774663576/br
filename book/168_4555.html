<div class="line_en">Atop the King's Tower, Jon Snow leaned on the padded crutch that Maester Aemon had given him and watched the grey plume rise. Styr had lost all hope of taking Castle Black unawares when Jon escaped him, yet even so, he need not have warned of his approach so bluntly. You may kill us, he reflected, but no one will be butchered in their beds. That much I did, at least.</div>

<div class="line_en">His leg still hurt like blazes when he put his weight on it. He'd needed Clydas to help him don his fresh-washed blacks and lace up his boots that morning, and by the time they were done he'd wanted to drown himself in the milk of the poppy. Instead he had settled for half a cup of dreamwine, a chew of willow bark, and the crutch. The beacon was burning on Weatherback Ridge, and the Night's Watch had need of every man. "I can fight," he insisted when they tried to stop him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever you called them, the straw soldiers had been Maester Aemon's notion. They had more breeches and jerkins and tunics in the storerooms than they'd had men to fill them, so why not stuff some with straw, drape a cloak around their shoulders, and set them to standing watches? Noye had placed them on every tower and in half the windows. Some were even clutching spears, or had crossbows cocked under their arms. The hope was that the Therms would see them from afar and decide that Castle Black was too well defended to attack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管名称如何，稻草兵是伊蒙学士的主意。既然储藏室里有许许多多的裤子、上衣和背心闲置，干吗不在其中塞上稻草，肩头披挂斗篷，让它们立在那儿放哨呢？经过诺伊的布置，每座塔楼和半数窗户都有它们的身影，有些甚至握持长矛，或者胳膊底架着十字弓。希望瑟恩人远远看到，便断定黑城堡防御充分，放弃攻击的念头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Across the yard, one of the bowmen on the roof of the old Flint Barracks had unlaced his breeches and was pissing through a crenel. Mully, he knew from the man's greasy orange hair. Men in black cloaks were visible on other roofs and tower tops as well, though nine of every ten happened to be made of straw. "The scarecrow sentinels," Donal Noye called them. Only we're the crows, Jon mused, and most of us were scared enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院子对面，古老的燧石兵营顶上也有个弓箭手，此刻他解开裤子，正往城垛外撒尿。穆利，他从对方油腻腻的橙色头发认出来。其他屋顶和塔楼上也能看到黑衣人，但其中十个有九个是稻草做的。唐纳·诺伊称它们为“稻草哨兵”。讽刺的是，我们却是乌鸦，琼恩暗想，而且大都吓得够呛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon had six scarecrows sharing the roof of the King's Tower with him, along with two actual breathing brothers. Deaf Dick Follard sat in a crenel, methodically cleaning and oiling the mechanism of his crossbow to make sure the wheel turned smoothly, while the Oldtown boy wandered restlessly around the parapets, fussing with the clothes on straw men. Maybe he thinks they will fight better if they're posed just right. Or maybe this waiting is fraying his nerves the way it's fraying mine.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy claimed to be eighteen, older than Jon, but he was green as summer grass for all that. Satin, they called him, even in the wool and mail and boiled leather of the Night's Watch; the name he'd gotten in the brothel where he'd been born and raised. He was pretty as a girl with his dark eyes, soft skin, and raven's ringlets. Half a year at Castle Black had toughened up his hands, however, and Noye said he was passable with a crossbow. Whether he had the courage to face what was coming, though…</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon used the crutch to limp across the tower top. The King's Tower was not the castle's tallest -- the high, slim, crumbling Lance held that honor, though Othell Yarwyck had been heard to say it might topple any day. Nor was the King's Tower strongest -- the Tower of Guards beside the kingsroad would be a tougher nut to crack. But it was tall enough, strong enough, and well placed beside the Wall, overlooking the gate and the foot of the wooden stair.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It can't," his uncle told him. "That is the point. The Night's Watch is pledged to take no part in the quarrels of the realm. Yet over the centuries certain Lords Commander, more proud than wise, forgot their vows and near destroyed us all with their ambitions. Lord Commander Runcel Hightower tried to bequeathe the Watch to his bastard son. Lord Commander Rodrik Flint thought to make himself King-beyond-theWall. Tristan Mudd, Mad Marq Rankenfell, Robin Hill… did you know that six hundred years ago, the commanders at Snowgate and the Nightfort went to war against each other? And when the Lord Commander tried to stop them, they joined forces to murder him? The Stark in Winterfell had to take a hand… and both their heads. Which he did easily, because their strongholds were not defensible. The Night's Watch had nine hundred and ninety-six Lords Commander before Jeor Mormont, most of them men of courage and honor… but we have had cowards and fools as well, our tyrants and our madmen. We survive because the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms know that we pose no threat to them, no matter who should lead us. Our only foes are to the north, and to the north we have the Wall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无法防御，”叔叔告诉他，“这正是关键。守夜人发誓不偏不倚，不介入境内任何纷争。然而千百年来，某些骄傲压倒智慧的总司令却背弃了誓言，野心作祟，差点让我们完全毁灭。伦赛·海塔尔总司令试图将位置留给私生子，罗德里克·菲林特想让自己当上塞外之王，崔斯坦·穆德、‘疯子’马柯·蓝肯菲尔，罗宾·希山…你知道六百年前，风雪门和长夜堡的指挥官彼此宣战吗？总司令试图阻止，他们反而联合起来谋杀他。临冬城的史塔克家族不得不出面干预…摘了他俩的脑袋。行动很容易成功，因为各要塞面南毫无防守。在杰奥·莫尔蒙之前，守夜人军团已有过九百九十六任总司令，他们大都英勇正直…却也有少数懦夫和笨蛋，专横的独裁者，甚至疯子。我们能够生存，是因为七国的领主和国王们明白，不管由谁领导，我们对他们都构不成威胁。唯一的敌人在北方，而面北我们有长城。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Castle Black had a wall of sorts at last, a crescent-shaped barricade ten feet high made of stores; casks of nails and barrels of salt mutton, crates, bales of black broadcloth, stacked logs, sawn timbers, firehardened stakes, and sacks and sacks of grain. The crude rampart enclosed the two things most worth defending; the gate to the north, and the foot of the great wooden switchback stair that clawed and climbed its way up the face of the Wall like a drunken thunderbolt, supported by wooden beams as big as tree trunks driven deep into the ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，黑城堡终于有了一道所谓的墙，一堆十尺高排成新月形的障碍物，由各种储藏品构成：桶桶钉子和腌羊肉、柳条箱、捆捆黑毛织品、堆积的圆木、锯好的柴火、淬硬的尖桩，还有袋袋谷物。简陋的壁垒圈起两样最值得守卫的东西——通往北方的城门和登上城墙的巨大之字形木楼梯，楼梯如一道蜿蜒曲折的闪电沿墙攀升，踏脚的木梁有树干那么粗，深陷在冰层里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only now those foes have gotten past the Wall to come up from the south, Jon reflected, and the lords and kings of the Seven Kingdoms have forgotten us. We are caught between the hammer and the anvil. Without a wall Castle Black could not be held; Donal Noye knew that as well as any. "The castle does them no good," the armorer told his little garrison. "Kitchens, common hall, stables, even the towers… let them take it all. We'll empty the armory and move what stores we can to the top of the Wall, and make our stand around the gate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而现在，敌人越过长城，从南方杀来，琼恩心想，七国的领主和国王们却都忘了我们。人为刀俎，我为鱼肉。没有围墙，黑城堡是守不住的，唐纳·诺伊跟所有人一样明白。“城堡对他们来说没什么用处，”武器师傅告诉他小小的守备队，“厨房，大厅，马厩，甚至塔楼…让他们统统占去。我们尽量把兵器库搬空，运到长城顶上，然后坚守在城门附近。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The last few moles were still making the long climb, Jon saw, urged on by his brothers. Grenn was carrying a little boy in his arms, while Pyp, two flights below, let an old man lean upon his shoulder. The oldest villagers still waited below for the cage to make its way back down to them. He saw a mother pulling along two children, one on either hand, as an older boy ran past her up the steps. Two hundred feet above them, Sky Blue Su and Lady Meliana (who was no lady, all her friends agreed) stood on a landing, looking south. They had a better view of the smoke than he did, no doubt. Jon wondered about the villagers who had chosen not to flee. There were always a few, too stubborn or too stupid or too brave to run, a few who preferred to fight or hide or bend the knee. Maybe the Therms would spare them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩看见最后几个鼹鼠村民仍在漫长的攀爬过程中，弟兄们正加以催促。葛兰怀抱一个小男童，而派普在两级楼梯下面扶持着一位老人，而最老的村民们仍在下面等待铁笼重新放下。有位母亲拖着两个孩子，一手牵一个，另一个大点的男孩越过她，向顶端跑去。在他们头上两百尺，天蓝苏和梅利安娜小姐（她不是什么小姐，她所有的朋友一致同意）站在楼梯口，望向南方。无疑对烟雾，她们比他看得更清楚。琼恩想到那些没有选择逃离的村民，总有一些人不愿逃跑，要么太固执，要么太愚蠢，要么太勇敢，宁愿留下来战斗、躲藏，甚或屈膝投降。也许瑟恩人会在匆忙间放过他们吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We are the garrison, Jon told himself, and look at us. The brothers Bowen Marsh had left behind were old men, cripples, and green boys, just as Donal Noye had warned him. He could see some wrestling barrels up the steps, others on the barricade; stout old Kegs, as slow as ever, Spare Boot hopping along briskly on his carved wooden leg, half-mad Easy who fancied himself Florian the Fool reborn, Dornish Dilly, Red Alyn of the Rosewood, Young Henly (well past fifty), Old Henly (well past seventy), Hairy Hal, Spotted Pate of Maidenpool. A couple of them saw Jon looking down from atop the King's Tower and waved up at him. others turned away. They still think me a tumcloak. That was a bitter draft to drink, but Jon could not blame them. He was a bastard, after all. Everyone knew that bastards were wanton and treacherous by nature, having been born of lust and deceit. And he had made as many enemies as friends at Castle Black… Rast, for one. Jon had once threatened to have Ghost rip his throat out unless he stopped tormenting Samwell Tarly, and Rast did not forget things like that. He was raking dry leaves into piles under the stairs just now, but every so often he stopped long enough to give Jon a nasty look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而今只有我们是长城的守卫，琼恩告诉自己，瞧瞧我们吧。正如唐纳·诺伊警告的那样，波文·马尔锡留下的弟兄都是老弱病残，以及仍在受训的男孩。他看见他们中有些人正奋力将木桶推上楼梯，另一些在路障边把守：矮胖的老“木桶”，动作一如既往的缓慢；“省靴”使劲拖着木头假腿一跳一跳地往前走；“半疯伊希”认为自己是傻瓜佛罗里安重生；还有多恩人迪利、玫瑰林的红埃林、小亨利（五十好几岁）、老亨利（七十好几岁）、“毛人”哈尔及女泉镇的麻子佩特等等。其中几个看到琼恩从国王塔上望下来，便朝他挥手，可多数人扭过头去。他们仍认为我是变色龙。这是一杯苦酒，但琼恩怪不得他们。毕竟，他是个私生子，大家都认为私生子的血脉出自欲望与欺骗，天生便是反复无常，背信弃义，而他在黑城堡树立的敌人跟结交的朋友一样多…譬如雷斯特就是其中之一。琼恩曾威胁除非他放过山姆威尔·塔利，否则便要让白灵撕开他的喉咙，这事对方没有忘记。此刻他正将干树叶耙到楼梯底下，分成一大堆一大堆，但时不时停下片刻，恶狠狠地瞪琼恩一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three-quarters of the village had taken Jon's warning to heart and come to Castle Black for refuge. Noye had decreed that every man still spry enough to hold a spear or swing an axe would help defend the barricade, else they could damn well go home and take their chances with the Therms. He had emptied the armory to put good steel in their hands; big double-bladed axes, razor-sharp daggers, longswords, maces, spiked morningstars. Clad in studded leather jerkins and mail hauberks, with greaves for their legs and gorgets to keep their heads on their shoulders, a few of them even looked like soldiers. In a bad light.

<div class="line_en">He has a lord's voice, Jon thought. His father had always said that in battle a captain's lungs were as important as his sword arm. "It does not matter how brave or brilliant a man is, if his commands cannot be heard," Lord Eddard told his sons, so Robb and he used to climb the towers of Winterfell to shout at each other across the yard. Donal Noye could have drowned out both of them. The moles all went in terror of him, and rightfully so, since he was always threatening to rip their heads off.</div>

The moonlight glimmered off their spears and axes, and the gruesome devices on their round leathern shields; skulls and bones, serpents, bear claws, twisted demonic faces. Free folk, he knew. The Therms carried shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses, but theirs were plain and unadorned. These were the lighter wicker shields of raiders.</div>

He could hear the wildlings shouting to each other, and somewhere to the west a warhom blew. The world was moonlight and shadow, and time became an endless round of notch and draw and loose. A wildling arrow ripped through the throat of the straw sentinel beside him, but Jon Snow scarcely noticed. Give me one clean shot at the Magnar of Thenn, he prayed to his father's gods.

When the roof collapsed, a flames rose up roaring, so loud they almost drowned out the warhorns of the Thenns. Fifty of them were pounding up the kingsroad in tight column, their shields held up above their heads. Others were swarming through the vegetable garden, across the flagstone yard, around the old dry well. Three had hacked their way through the doors of Maester Aemon's apartments in the timber keep below the rookery, and a desperate fight was going on atop the Silent Tower, longswords against bronze axes. None of that mattered. The dance has moved on, he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时东边的马厩也着了火，黑烟和干草灰从牲畜栏里泻出。当房顶倒塌时，一束火焰呼啸着窜起，声音如此之响，甚至盖过瑟恩人的战号。他们五十人排成紧密队形，沿国王大道踏步走来，盾牌高举过头。其他人则通过菜园蜂拥前进，穿过院子的石板地，绕过干涸的古井。其中三人砍开鸦巢底下木造堡垒的门，那是伊蒙学士的居所，而沉默塔顶正展开一场殊死搏斗，长剑对抗青铜战斧。这些都不是关键。好戏在后头，他心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They wore halffielms, and had thin bronze disks sewn to their long leather shirts. Many wielded bronze axes, though a few were chipped stone. More had short stabbing spears with leaf -shaped heads that gleamed redly in the light from the burning stables. They were screaming in the Old Tongue as they stormed the barricade, jabbing with their spears, swinging their bronze axes, spilling corn and blood with equal abandon while crossbow quarrels and arrows rained down on them from the archers that Donal Noye had posted on the stair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们戴着半盔，长长的皮革衫上缝有青铜薄片，许多人挥舞青铜斧，有些是石斧，还有些人拿短矛，就着马厩的火光，树叶状的枪尖闪烁红芒。他们一边用古语尖声呼叫，一边攻击路障，用矛刺戳，用青铜斧挥砍，谷物和鲜血一起疯狂流泻，唐纳·诺伊布置在楼梯上的弓手们朝他们如雨般射出弩矢与箭支。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no time to think or plan or shout for help. Jon dropped his bow, reached back over his shoulder, ripped Longclaw from its sheath, and buried the blade in the middle of the first head to pop out of the tower. Bronze was no match for Valyrian steel. The blow sheared right through the Thenn's helm and deep into his skull, and he went crashing back down where he'd come from. There were more behind him, Jon knew from the shouting. He fell back and called to Satin. The next man to make the climb got a quarrel through his cheek. He vanished too. "The oil," Jon said. Satin nodded. Together they snatched up the thick quilted pads they'd left beside the fire, lifted the heavy kettle of boiling oil, and dumped it down the hole on the Therms below. The shrieks were as bad as anything he had ever heard, and Satin looked as though he was going to be sick. Jon kicked the trapdoor shut, set the heavy iron kettle on top of it, and gave the boy with the pretty face a hard shake. "Retch later," Jon yelled. "Come."</div>

<div class="line_en">No archer could have asked for an easier shot. The Thenns had their backs to the King's Tower as they charged the crescent, clambering over bags and barrels to reach the men in black. Both Jon and Satin chanced to choose the same target. He had just reached the top of the barricade when an arrow sprouted from his neck and a quarrel between his shoulder blades. Half a heartbeat later a longsword took him in the belly and he fell back onto the man behind him. Jon reached down to his quiver and found it empty again. Satin was winding back his crossbow. He left him to it and went for more arrows, but he hadn't taken more than three steps before the trap slammed open three feet in front of him. Bloody hell, I never even heard the door break.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had only been gone from the parapets for a few moments, but everything below had changed. A dozen black brothers and a few Mole's Town men still stood atop the crates and barrels, but the wildlings were swarming over all along the crescent, pushing them back. Jon saw one shove his spear up through Rast's belly so hard he lifted him into the air. Young Henly was dead and Old Henly was dying, surrounded by foes. He could see Easy spinning and slashing, laughing like a loon, his cloak flapping as he leapt from cask to cask. A bronze axe caught him just below the knee and the laughter turned into a bubbling shriek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们离开城垛才一小会儿，下面的情况却全变了。十来个黑衣弟兄及一些鼹鼠村民仍站在桶子和木头顶上据守，但周围爬满了野人，将他们逼退。琼恩看到一支矛刺穿雷斯特肚腹，力量如此之大，甚至把他挑到空中。小亨利死了，老亨利被敌人包围，也命不久矣。他看到伊希旋转劈砍，像疯子一样哈哈大笑，从一个桶跳到另一个桶，斗篷飞扬，然后一把青铜斧砍中他膝盖下面，笑声化为凄厉的惨叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It happened quickly. One mole fled and then another, and suddenly all the villagers were throwing down their weapons and abandoning the barricade. The brothers were too few to hold alone. Jon watched them try and form a line to fall back in order, but the Thenns washed over them with spear and axe, and then they were fleeing too. Domish Dilly slipped and went down on his face, and a wildling planted a spear between his shoulder blades. Kegs, slow and short of breath, had almost reached the bottom step when a Therm caught the end of his cloak and yanked him around… but a crossbow quarrel dropped the man before his axe could fall. "Got him," Satin crowed, as Kegs staggered to the stair and began to crawl up the steps on hands and knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切发生得非常之快。一个“鼹鼠”逃走，然后是另一个，接着所有村民突然之间全部扔下武器，放弃了路障。黑衣人数量太少，无法单独支撑。琼恩看到弟兄们试图排成一线，有秩序地后撤，但瑟恩人持着矛斧猛扑而上，然后他们也逃了。多恩人迪利脚下一滑，扑倒在地，野人的矛顿时刺入他的肩胛骨。“木桶”动作缓慢，气喘吁吁，差点要到达最下面的楼梯时，一个瑟恩人抓住他斗篷，将其拉回来…但还来不及下斧，就被一支弩箭射倒。“我射中他了。”纱丁欢呼，“木桶”跌跌撞撞跑向楼梯，手脚并用地朝上爬去。">查看中文翻译</div>

The archers and crossbowmen on the higher landings were trying to drop shafts over their heads. Jon nocked an arrow, drew, and loosed, and was pleased when one of the wildlings went rolling down the steps. The heat of the fires was making the Wall weep, and the flames danced and shimmered against the ice. The steps shook to the footsteps of men running for their lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">Again Jon notched and drew and loosed, but there was only one of him and one of Satin, and a good sixty or seventy Therms pounding up the stairs, killing as they went, drunk on victory. On the fourth landing, three brothers in black cloaks stood shoulder to shoulder with longswords in their hands, and battle was joined again, briefly. But there were only three and soon enough the wildling tide washed over them, and their blood dripped down the steps. "A man is never so vulnerable in battle as when he flees," Lord Eddard had told Jon once. "A running man is like a wounded animal to a soldier. It gets his bloodlust up." The archers on the fifth landing fled before the battle even reached them. It was a rout, a red rout.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩沉着地将一支火箭搭上弓弦，让纱丁用火炬点燃，然后走向城垛，引弓，瞄准，发射。箭支拖着一束火尾飞速向下，钉入目标之中，发出噼里啪啦的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was then that he saw Styr. The Magnar was climbing up the barricade, over the gutted corn sacks and smashed barrels and the bodies of friends and foe alike. His bronze scale armor gleamed darkly in the firelight. Styr had taken off his helm to survey the scene of his triumph, and the bald earless whoreson was smiling. In his hand was a long weirwood spear with an ornate bronze head. When he saw the gate, he pointed the spear at it and barked something in the Old Tongue to the half-dozen Therms around him. Too late, Jon thought. You should have led your men over the barricade, you might have been able to save a few…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他看到了斯迪。马格拿爬上路障，经过割裂的袋子、砸碎的木桶，踩踏着朋友和敌人们的尸首，青铜鳞甲于火光下闪着阴郁的色泽。斯迪摘下头盔，视察胜利的景象。这没耳朵的秃头杂种在微笑，看到城门，又举起手中带有装饰着华丽的青铜枪头的鱼梁木长矛指点，一边用古语对周围五六个瑟恩人大叫大嚷。太晚了，琼恩心想，你早该叫你的人撤过路障，也许还能挽救一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not Styr. The steps. Or more precisely, the casks and kegs and sacks that Donal Noye had piled up beneath the steps, as high as the first landing; the barrels of lard and lamp oil, the bags of leaves and oily rags, the split logs, bark, and wood shavings. "Again," said Jon, and, "Again," and, "Again." Other longbowmen were firing too, from every tower top in range, some sending their arrows up in high arcs to drop before the Wall. When Jon ran out of fire arrows, he and Satin began to light the torches and fling them from the crenels.</div>

Jon could only hope that most of their own people had staggered up to safety before Noye threw the torches. The black brothers at least had known the plan, but the villagers had not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼梯上方又燃起一团火焰。老旧的木板像海绵般吸足了油，唐纳·诺伊将第九到第七层平台之间统统浸满。琼恩只盼诺伊扔出火炬时，自己人已跌跌撞撞地登上安全地带。黑衣弟兄们至少还知道计划，但村民都不了解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wind and fire did the rest. All Jon had to do was watch. With flames below and flames above, the wildlings had nowhere to go. Some continued upward, and died. Some went downward, and died. Some stayed where they were. They died as well. Many leapt from the steps before they burned, and died from the fall. Twenty-odd Thenns were still huddled together between the fires when the ice cracked from the heat, and the whole lower third of the stair broke off, along with several tons of ice. That was the last that Jon Snow saw of Styr, the Magnar of Thenn. The Wall defends itself, he thought.</div>
