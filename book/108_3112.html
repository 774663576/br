<div class="line_en">Many people find it difficult living with someone who likes to be alone. It grates on those who can't handle it themselves. But Sonja didn't whine more than she had to. "I took you as you were," she used to say.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cat jumps off the windowsill in the living room and goes into the kitchen. Bad loser, thinks Ove and goes to the front door. It's been years since he last made a bet with someone about what time the mail would come. He used to make bets with Rune when they were on vacation in the summers, which grew so intensive that they developed complex systems of marginal extensions and half minutes to determine who was most accurate. That was how it was back in those days. The mail arrived at twelve o'clock on the dot, so one needed precise demarcations to be able to say who had guessed right. Nowadays it isn't like that. Nowadays the mail can be delivered halfway through the afternoon any old way it pleases. The post office takes care of it when it feels like it and you just have to be grateful and that's it. Ove tried to make bets with Sonja after he and Rune stopped talking. But she didn't understand the rules. So he gave up.</div>

<div class="line_en">The youth barely manages to avoid being knocked off the steps when Ove throws the door open. Ove looks at him in surprise. He's wearing a postman's uniform.</div>

<div class="line_en">The youth looks, if possible, even less thrilled about recognizing Ove than vice versa. He looks a little like a waiter sometimes does, when he's undecided about whether to serve you your food or take it into the kitchen and spit on it. The lad looks coolly at Ove before reluctantly handing the mail over with a grumpy "There y'go." Ove accepts it without taking his eyes off him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="认出欧维后，小伙子看上去可能还不如对方来精神，就像个不知道该把菜端给你，还是回厨房往盘子里再吐一口口水的服务员。他警惕地看着欧维，看看信和报纸，又看看欧维。然后他终于又把它们交了出来，含糊地说了个“给”字，欧维伸手一接，两眼紧盯着小无赖不放。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The youth looks like he can't come up with an answer. He fiddles with a newspaper and a letter. And that's when Ove notices that it's the same youth who argued with him about that bicycle a few days ago, by the storage shed. The bicycle the youth said he was going to "fix." Of course Ove knows what that means. "Fix" means "steal and sell on the Internet" to these rascals, that's the long and short of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小伙子看上去并不打算回答。他递上一份报纸和一封信。欧维首先注意到，这人和他前几天在储藏室边因为自行车而与之争执的小伙子是同一个人。小伙子说他要“修车”，但欧维知道是怎么回事。对这帮小无赖来说，“修车”的意思等同于“偷车上网卖掉”。就是这么回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“还有什么事？”欧维问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nods at the folded-double pile of junk that used to be Ove's mailbox until the Lanky One who can't back up with a trailer backed his trailer into it -- then nods at the letter and newspaper in Ove's hand. Ove looks down at them. The newspaper is one of those local rags they hand out for nothing even when one puts up a sign quite expressly telling them to do no such bloody thing. And the letter is most likely advertising, Ove imagines. Admittedly his name and address have been written in longhand on the front, but that's a typical advertising trick. To make one think it's a letter from a real person, and then one opens it and in a flash one has been subjected to marketing. That trick won't work on Ove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他冲那一沓铁皮点点头——在不会挂拖斗倒车的盲流撞上它之前，那曾是欧维的信箱——又冲欧维手中的信和报纸点点头。欧维低头看了一眼，是份地方报纸，就是那种即使你清楚表明不感冒还是照样会发到你手上的免费报纸。肯定是什么广告，欧维认为。尽管信封上他的名字和地址是手写的，但也一定只是典型的宣传伎俩。它让你感觉像是熟人写的，可信一打开，你就立马成了市场营销的牺牲品。欧维可不吃这一套。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, what the hell… I was just wondering if you have a wife called Sonja," he manages to say.</div>
