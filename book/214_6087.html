<div class="line_en">The red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac, there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. I could only judge that all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to perish with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火把的红光照亮了木屋的内部，我所料想的最坏的局面呈现出来。海盗们已占领木屋和补给品，一桶白兰地、猪肉和干面包都放在老地方，但使我万分恐惧的是没见到一名俘虏，我只能假定他们已全部遇害。我为自己没有能与他们同甘共苦而遭到良心的强烈谴责。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left alive. Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. The sixth had only risen upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently dressed. I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋中一共只有六名海盗，此外活着的那个也死了。其中五个突然从醉梦中跳起来，满脸通红，杀气腾腾。第六个刚刚用胳膊撑起身子，面色死灰，缠在头上的绷带渗出血迹来，说明他是新近受伤的，而包扎伤口的时间则更近一些。我记得昨天枪战中被击中后逃回树林里去的那名海盗肯定就是这个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John's shoulder. He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used to. He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他在白兰地桶上坐下来，开始装一斗烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Give me a loan of the link, Dick," said he; and then, when he had a good light, "That'll do, lad," he added; "stick the glim in the wood heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn't stand up for Mr. Hawkins; HE'LL excuse you, you may lay to that. And so, Jim" -- stopping the tobacco -- "here you were, and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old John. I see you were smart when first I set my eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我借个火，狄克，”他说。在点着了烟斗后，他又加了一句：“行了，伙计，把火把插在柴堆上吧。诸位，你们可以随便些！不必站在那儿，霍金斯先生不会介意的，你们可以相信我。我说，吉姆，”他吸了一口烟，“你来这里真使我可怜的老约翰喜出望外。我第一次见到你就看出你是个机灵的小家伙，但这会儿你来，我却实在弄不明白为什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here," says he, "I'll give you a piece of my mind. I've always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit, and the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my cock, you've got to. Cap'n Smollett's a fine seaman, as I'll own up to any day, but stiff on discipline. 'Dooty is dooty,' says he, and right he is. Just you keep clear of the cap'n. The doctor himself is gone dead again you -- 'ungrateful scamp' was what he said; and the short and the long of the whole story is about here: you can't go back to your own lot, for they won't have you; and without you start a third ship's company all by yourself, which might be lonely, you'll have to jine with Cap'n Silver."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Am I to answer, then?" I asked with a very tremulous voice. Through all this sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.</div>

<div class="line_en">So far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly believed the truth of Silver's statement, that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还好，我的朋友们还活着。虽然西尔弗的话我有一部分相信，比如他说大夫他们对我擅自逃跑极为恼火，但听了这番话，我与其说感到难过，毋宁说感到欣慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你落到我们手里，这不用我说，”西尔弗继续讲下去，“你自己也清楚，我主张心平气和地讲道理，我以为强行逼压没有什么好处。你要是想干就加入我们这伙；你要是不干，吉姆，你尽可以回答不干，我绝不强求。伙计，要是哪个水手能说出比这更公道的话，让我不得好死！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to, my friend," cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in his first gracious tones, he replied to me, "Yesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins," said he, "in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a flag of truce. Says he, 'Cap'n Silver, you're sold out. Ship's gone.' Well, maybe we'd been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. I won't say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack of fools look fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the fishiest. 'Well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.' We bargained, him and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for them, they've tramped; I don't know where's they are."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没问你，你还是给我闭上你那臭嘴，朋友。”西尔弗狠狠地喝住开口的人。接着他还是用先前那种文雅的语气回答我说：“昨天早上，霍金斯先生，利弗西大夫打着白旗来找我们。他说，西尔弗船长，你们被扔下了。船已经开走了。是的，也许乘我们喝酒唱歌的当儿。他们把船开走了。这一点我不否认。至少我们没有谁发觉。我们跑过去一看，船果真不见了。我从来没见过这样一群傻瓜蛋干瞪着眼时的傻样，你尽量相信我的话，没有比这帮家伙更蠢的了。大夫说，那好，让我们谈谈条件吧。我跟他讲妥了条件，我们到这里来，补给品、白兰地、木屋，还有多亏你们想得周到的劈好的柴禾，用我们的话说，一条船从桅顶到龙头都归我们所有。至于他们，反正已离开此地，现在他们在哪儿，我可不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

'Four,' says he; 'four, and one of us wounded. As for that boy, I don't know where he is, confound him,' says he, 'nor I don't much care. We're about sick of him.' These was his words.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," said I, "I am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have to look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it's little I care. I've seen too many die since I fell in with you. But there's a thing or two I have to tell you," I said, and by this time I was quite excited; "and the first is this: here you are, in a bad way -- ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who did it -- it was I! I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land, and I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was out. And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her where you'll never see her more, not one of you. The laugh's on my side; I've had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you than I fear a fly. Kill me, if you please, or spare me. But one thing I'll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I'll save you all I can. It is for you to choose. Kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”我说，“我不是个傻瓜蛋，不至于不知道该选择哪条道。我不在乎，你该怎么着就怎么着。自从认识你们以来，经我看到的就死了不少人。不过有几件事我要对你们讲。”我说，我这时非常激动：“首先，你们在这儿的处境不妙，船丢了，财宝丢了，人也丢了；你们整个计划都弄糟了。如果你们想知道是谁干的──告诉你们是我！是我在发现陆地的那天晚上，躲在苹果桶里听到了你约翰，还有你狄克·约翰逊，还有现在已沉海底的汉兹的谈话，不到一小时我就把你们说的每一句话都告诉了船长。至于那条船，也是我割断绳索，杀死了你们留在船上看守的人，是我把船开到你们任何人都见不到的地方。该嘲笑的是你们，这件事，刚开始我就占了上风。你们在我看来并不比一只苍蝇可怕，要杀要放随你们的便，我只想提一句，如果你们因为当过海盗受到审判，我将尽我所能救你们的命。现在该轮到你们选择了。再杀一个，这对你们没什么好处，要是放了我，留下一个证人，还可以让你们免受绞刑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a long pause after this. I stood straight up against the wall, my heart still going like a sledge -- hammer, but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom. Silver leant back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着是一阵持续很久的沉默。我靠墙边站直了身，心还像敲鼓似的咚咚跳，但心中还闪现出一线希望。西尔弗双手交叉倚墙而坐，烟斗斜叼在嘴角上，像在教堂里一样平静。然而两只眼睛却滴溜溜地乱转，眼梢始终监视着那帮不顺从的家伙。那些海盗逐渐退到木屋的另一端，聚在一起，他们交头接耳的低语声一直像小河流水般源源不断地传到我耳朵里。他们一个接一个地抬头看看我们，这时，火把的红光就会把他们紧张的脸孔照亮一两秒钟。他们的视线对着的是西尔弗而不是我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ax your pardon, sir," returned one of the men; "you're pretty free with some of the rules; maybe you'll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. This crew's dissatisfied; this crew don't vally bullying a marlin-spike; this crew has its rights like other crews, I'll make so free as that; and by your own rules, I take it we can talk together. I ax your pardon, sir, acknowledging you for to be captaing at this present; but I claim my right, and steps outside for a council."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请原谅，先生，”一个海盗应声答道，“你经常不遵守这一行的好些规矩，也许有些规矩你最好还是注意些好。大家都对你不满。我们可不是好欺负的，我们有同其他船上水手一样的权利──我就是敢这样说。根据你自己定下的规矩，我认为我们可以谈谈。请你原谅，先生，因为我承认目前你是我们的船长，但是我要行使我的权利：到外面去商量一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology. "According to rules," said one. "Forecastle council," said Morgan.

<div class="line_en">"Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins," he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible, "you're within half a plank of death, and what's a long sight worse, of torture. They're going to throw me off. But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn't mean to; no, not till you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain. But I see you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he'll save your neck!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, by gum, I do!" he answered. "Ship gone, neck gone -- that's the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner-well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll save your life -- if so be as I can -- from them. But, see here, Jim -- tit for tat -- you save Long John from swinging."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然完了，老天作证，我说着了！”他回答说。“船丢了，脑袋也保不住了，就是这么一回事。那天我向海湾一看，没见到我们的船，吉姆·霍金斯，我知道这下子完蛋了，虽然我是个很不服输的人。至于那些饭桶，相信我，他们胆小如鼠，狗屁不如。我定会竭尽全力从他们手里把你救下来。但是你看现在，吉姆──你得以德报德──你可不能对不起我老约翰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
