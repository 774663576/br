<div class="line_en">The only semi-regular male figure in my life was my grandfather, my mother's father, who was a force to be reckoned with. He was divorced from my grandmother and didn't live with us, but he was around. His name was Temperance Noah, which was odd since he was not a man of moderation at all. He was boisterous and loud. His nickname in the neighborhood was "Tat Shisha," which translates loosely to "the smokin' hot grandpa." And that's exactly who he was. He loved the ladies, and the ladies loved him. He'd put on his best suit and stroll through the streets of Soweto on random afternoons, making everybody laugh and charming all the women he'd meet. He had a big, dazzling smile with bright white teeth -- false teeth. At home, he'd take them out and I'd watch him do that thing where he looked like he was eating his own face.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he was up you couldn't stop him, but his mood swings were wild. In his youth he'd been a boxer, and one day he said I'd disrespected him and now he wanted to box me. He was in his eighties. I was twelve. He had his fists up, circling me. "Let's go, Trevah! Come on! Put your fists up! Hit me! I'll show you I'm still a man! Let's go!" I couldn't hit him because I wasn't about to hit my elder. Plus I'd never been in a fight and I wasn't going to have my first one be with an eighty-year-old man. I ran to my mom, and she got him to stop. The day after his pugilistic rage, he sat in his chair and didn't move or say a word all day.</div>

<div class="line_en">We found out much later in life that he was bipolar, but before that we just thought he was eccentric. One time he borrowed my mother's car to go to the shop for milk and bread. He disappeared and didn't come home until late that night when we were way past the point of needing the milk or the bread. Turned out he'd passed a young woman at the bus stop and, believing no beautiful woman should have to wait for a bus, he offered her a ride to where she lived -- three hours away. My mom was furious with him because he'd cost us a whole tank of petrol, which was enough to get us to work and school for two weeks.</div>

<div class="line_en">In addition to my mom there was my aunt Sibongile; she and her first husband, Dinky, had two kids, my cousins Mlungisi and Bulelwa. Sibongile was a powerhouse, a strong woman in every sense, big-chested, the mother hen. Dinky, as his name implies, was dinky. He was a small man. He was abusive, but not really. It was more like he tried to be abusive, but he wasn't very good at it. He was trying to live up to this image of what he thought a husband should be, dominant, controlling. I remember being told as a child, "If you don't hit your woman, you don't love her." That was the talk you'd hear from men in bars and in the streets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dinky was trying to masquerade as this patriarch that he wasn't. He'd slap my aunt and hit her and she'd take it and take it, and then eventually she'd snap and smack him down and put him back in his place. Dinky would always walk around like, "I control my woman." And you'd want to say, "Dinky, first of all, you don't. Second of all, you don't need to. Because she loves you." I can remember one day my aunt had really had enough. I was in the yard and Dinky came running out of the house screaming bloody murder. Sibongile was right behind him with a pot of boiling water, cursing at him and threatening to douse him with it. In Soweto you were always hearing about men getting doused with pots of boiling water -- often a woman's only recourse. And men were lucky if it was water. Some women used hot cooking oil. Water was if the woman wanted to teach her man a lesson. Oil meant she wanted to end it.</div>

Her eyes had gone white, clouded over by cataracts. She couldn't walk without someone holding her up. She'd sit in the kitchen next to the coal stove, bundled up in long skirts and head scarves, blankets over her shoulders. The coal stove was always on. It was for cooking, heating the house, heating water for baths. We put her there because it was the warmest spot in the house. In the morning someone would wake her and bring her to sit in the kitchen. At night someone would come take her to bed. That's all she did, all day, every day. Sit by the stove. She was fantastic and fully with it. She just couldn't see and didn't move.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fact that I grew up in a world run by women was no accident. Apartheid kept me away from my father because he was white, but for almost all the kids I knew on my grandmother's block in Soweto, apartheid had taken away their fathers as well, just for different reasons. Their fathers were off working in a mine somewhere, able to come home only during the holidays. Their fathers had been sent to prison. Their fathers were in exile, fighting for the cause. Women held the community together. "Wathint'Abafazi Wathint'imbokodo!" was the chant they would rally to during the freedom struggle. "When you strike a woman, you strike a rock." As a nation, we recognized the power of women, but in the home they were expected to submit and obey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我成长于一个女性掌控的世界里，这并非偶然。种族隔离制度将我和我父亲分开，因为他是白人，但其实我在索韦托认识的几乎所有孩子，也都和他们的父亲分开了，只不过分开的原因不一样。他们的父亲有些会在远方某个矿场工作，只在放假的时候回来。有些父亲在蹲监狱。有些父亲因为打架而被流放。女人们扛起了生活的重担。在自由抗争时期，她们会唱这样的歌——“Wathint' Abafazi Wathint' imbokodo！”，意思是“当你击打一个女人，你就是在击打一块顽石”。从国家的角度，我们尊重女性的力量，但是在家中，女性被认为是要顺从丈夫的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Soweto, religion filled the void left by absent men. I used to ask my mom if it was hard for her to raise me alone without a husband. She'd reply, "Just because I live without a man doesn't mean I've never had a husband. God is my husband." For my mom, my aunt, my grandmother, and all the other women on our street, life centered on faith. Prayer meetings would rotate houses up and down the block based on the day. These groups were women and children only. My mom would always ask my uncle Velile to join, and he'd say, "I would join if there were more men, but I can't be the only one here." Then the singing and praying would start, and that was his cue to leave.</div>

<div class="line_en">For these prayer meetings, we'd jam ourselves into the tiny living area of the host family's house and form a circle. Then we would go around the circle offering prayers. The grannies would talk about what was happening in their lives. "I'm happy to be here. I had a good week at work. I got a raise and I wanted to say thank you and praise Jesus." Sometimes they'd pull out their Bible and say, "This scripture spoke to me and maybe it will help you." Then there would be a bit of song. There was a leather pad called "the beat" that you'd strap to your palm, like a percussion instrument. Someone would clap along on that, keeping time while everyone sang, "Masango vulekani singene eJerusalema. Masango vulekani singene eJerusalema."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tuesday nights, the prayer meeting came to my grandmother's house, and I was always excited, for two reasons. One, I got to clap along on the beat for the singing. And two, I loved to pray. My grandmother always told me that she loved my prayers. She believed my prayers were more powerful, because I prayed in English. Everyone knows that Jesus, who's white, speaks English. The Bible is in English. Yes, the Bible was not written in English, but the Bible came to South Africa in English so to us it's in English. Which made my prayers the best prayers because English prayers get answered first. How do we know this? Look at white people. Clearly they're getting through to the right person. Add to that Matthew 19:14. "Suffer little children to come unto me," Jesus said, "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." So if a child is praying in English? To White Jesus? That's a powerful combination right there. Whenever I prayed, my grandmother would say, "That prayer is going to get answered. I can feel it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礼拜二，祈祷会在我外婆家办，我总是很兴奋。原因有两点：一是唱歌的时候，我可以带着皮垫打节拍；二是我喜欢祷告。外婆总是说，她喜欢我的祷告。她相信我的祈祷更有力量，因为我是用英文祷告的。所有人都知道，耶稣是个白人，说英语。《圣经》也是用英语写的。好吧，《圣经》最开始不是用英语写的，可《圣经》传到南非来时是英语版本，对我们来说，它就是用英语写的。这样，我的祷告就变成了最棒的，因为用英语祷告可以最先得到回应。我们是怎么知道这个秘密的？看看那些白人就行了。很显然，他们的祷告是有人听的。再加上《马太福音》19章14节。“让小孩到我这里来，不要禁止他们。”耶稣说，“因为在神国的，正是这样的人。”所以，让一个小孩用英文祷告？而且是向白人耶稣祷告？这简直是强强联合啊。每次我祷告的时候，我的外婆都会说：“这次的祷告将有应答。我能感觉到。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The most common were the spaza shops and the shebeens. The spaza shops were informal grocery stores. People would build a kiosk in their garage, buy wholesale bread and eggs, and then resell them piecemeal. Everyone in the township bought things in minute quantities because nobody had any money. You couldn't afford to buy a dozen eggs at a time, but you could buy two eggs because that's all you needed that morning. You could buy a quarter loaf of bread, a cup of sugar. The shebeens were unlawful bars in the back of someone's house. They'd put chairs in their backyard and hang out an awning and run a speakeasy. The shebeens were where men would go to drink after work and during prayer meetings and most any other time of day as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最常见的生意是小卖铺和小酒馆。小卖铺就是非正规的百货商店，人们从别处批发来面包和鸡蛋，再在自家车库里面支个摊，把它们一点一点地卖出去。镇上的人买东西都只买一点点，因为大家都没钱。你可能一次买不起一打鸡蛋，那太多了。但是你可以买两个，因为你那天早上就需要两个。你也可以买四分之一条面包和一小杯糖。小酒馆是开在别人家后院的非法酒吧，在后院放上椅子，支起遮阳篷，酒吧就开起来了。那是男人们最爱去的地方，下班了去，女人开祈祷会的时候去，或干脆在那儿泡一整天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is something magical about Soweto. Yes, it was a prison designed by our oppressors, but it also gave us a sense of self-determination and control. Soweto was ours. It had an aspirational quality that you don't find elsewhere. In America the dream is to make it out of the ghetto. In Soweto, because there was no leaving the ghetto, the dream was to transform the ghetto.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索韦托总有些奇妙之处。没错，这是殖民者用来囚禁我们的地方，但同时，这地方给了我们一种自主掌控的感觉。索韦托是属于我们的，它有一种自立自强的气息，是你在别的地方找不到的。如果说美国梦就是努力奋斗离开贫民窟的话，那么在索韦托，因为没法离开它，所以这里的梦想就是改变这个贫民窟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the million people who lived in Soweto, there were no stores, no bars, no restaurants. There were no paved roads, minimal electricity, inadequate sewerage. But when you put one million people together in one place, they find a way to make a life for themselves. A black-market economy rose up, with every type of business being run out of someone's house: auto mechanics, day care, guys selling refurbished tires.</div>

<div class="line_en">My grandmother lived in Orlando East. She had a two-room house. Not a two-bedroom house. A two-room house. There was a bedroom, and then there was basically a living room/kitchen/everything-else room. Some might say we lived like poor people. I prefer "open plan." My mom and I would stay there during school holidays. My aunt and cousins would be there whenever she was on the outs with Dinky. We all slept on the floor in one room, my mom and me, my aunt and my cousins, my uncle and my grandmother and my great-grandmother. The adults each had their own foam mattresses, and there was one big one that we'd roll out into the middle, and the kids slept on that.</div>

<div class="line_en">People built homes the way they bought eggs: a little at a time. Every family in the township was allocated a piece of land by the government. You'd first build a shanty on your plot, a makeshift structure of plywood and corrugated iron. Over time, you'd save up money and build a brick wall. One wall. Then you'd save up and build another wall. Then, years later, a third wall and eventually a fourth. Now you had a room, one room for everyone in your family to sleep, eat, do everything. Then you'd save up for a roof. Then windows. Then you'd plaster the thing. Then your daughter would start a family. There was nowhere for them to go, so they'd move in with you. You'd add another corrugated-iron structure onto your brick room and slowly, over years, turn that into a proper room for them as well. Now your house had two rooms. Then three. Maybe four. Slowly, over generations, you'd keep trying to get to the point where you had a home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sadly, no matter how fancy you made your house, there was one thing you could never aspire to improve: your toilet. There was no indoor running water, just one communal outdoor tap and one outdoor toilet shared by six or seven houses. Our toilet was in a corrugated-iron outhouse shared among the adjoining houses. Inside, there was a concrete slab with a hole in it and a plastic toilet seat on top; there had been a lid at some point, but it had broken and disappeared long ago. We couldn't afford toilet paper, so on the wall next to the seat was a wire hanger with old newspaper on it for you to wipe. The newspaper was uncomfortable, but at least I stayed informed while I handled my business.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had two shanties in the backyard that my grandmother would rent out to migrants and seasonal workers. We had a small peach tree in a tiny patch on one side of the house and on the other side my grandmother had a driveway. I never understood why my grandmother had a driveway. She didn't have a car. She didn't know how to drive. Yet she had a driveway. All of our neighbors had driveways, some with fancy, cast-iron gates. None of them had cars, either. There was no future in which most of these families would ever have cars. There was maybe one car for every thousand people, yet almost everyone had a driveway. It was almost like building the driveway was a way of willing the car to happen. The story of Soweto is the story of the driveways. It's a hopeful place.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, when I was around five years old, my gran left me at home for a few hours to go run errands. I was lying on the floor in the bedroom, reading. I needed to go, but it was pouring down rain. I was dreading going outside to use the toilet, getting drenched running out there, water dripping on me from the leaky ceiling, wet newspaper, the flies attacking me from below. Then I had an idea. Why bother with the outhouse at all? Why not put some newspaper on the floor and do my business like a puppy? That seemed like a fantastic idea. So that's what I did. I took the newspaper, laid it out on the kitchen floor, pulled down my pants, and squatted and got to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我五岁那年的一个下午，外婆要出去办事，就把我独自留在家里。我躺在卧室的地板上看了会儿书之后，想上厕所，但外面正在下暴雨。我很抵触出去上厕所这件事，想象一下，跑过去这一路会全身淋湿，进到厕所里，雨水还会从头顶上的铁皮棚裂缝里滴下来，旧报纸湿透了，屁股下面还会受到苍蝇军团的袭击。我突然灵光一闪。为什么要出去上厕所啊？我可以在地上铺张报纸，像小狗那样在家里解决啊！于是，我就这么做了。我拿了些报纸，铺在厨房地上，脱下裤子，蹲好，开始。">查看中文翻译</div>

It takes a minute to get the first shit out of the way and get in the zone and get comfortable. Once you reach that moment, that's when it gets really nice.</div>

The outhouse ruins that for you. The rain, the flies, you are robbed of your moment, and nobody should be robbed of that. Squatting and shitting on the kitchen floor that day, I was like, Wow. There are no flies. There's no stress. This is really great. I'm really enjoying this. I knew I'd made an excellent choice, and I was very proud of myself for making it. I'd reached that moment where I could relax and be with myself.

If you're not part of the prayer, the demon might leave our house and go to your house and curse you. So we needed everyone. The alarm was raised. The call went out.

<div class="line_en">Moments later the grannies came streaming in with their Bibles, through the gate and up the driveway, a dozen or more at least. Everyone went inside. The house was packed. This was by far the biggest prayer meeting we'd ever had -- the biggest thing that had ever happened in the history of our home, period. Everyone sat in the circle, praying and praying, and the prayers were strong. The grannies were chanting and murmuring and swaying back and forth, speaking in tongues. I was doing my best to keep my head low and stay out of it. Then my grandmother reached back and grabbed me, pulled me into the middle of the circle, and looked into my eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night I felt terrible. Before bed, I quietly prayed, "God, I am so sorry for all of this. I know this was not cool." Because I knew: God answers your prayers. God is your father. He's the man who's there for you, the man who takes care of you. When you pray, He stops and He takes His time and He listens, and I had subjected Him to two hours of old grannies praying when I knew that with all the pain and suffering in the world He had more important things to deal with than my shit.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was growing up we used to get American TV shows rebroadcast on our stations: Doogie Howser, M. D.; Murder, She Wrote; Rescue 911 with William Shatner. Most of them were dubbed into African languages. ALF was in Afrikaans. Transformers was in Sotho. But if you wanted to watch them in English, the original American audio would be simulcast on the radio. You could mute your TV and listen to that. Watching those shows, I realized that whenever black people were on-screen speaking in African languages, they felt familiar to me. They sounded like they were supposed to sound. Then I'd listen to them in simulcast on the radio, and they would all have black American accents. My perception of them changed. They didn't feel familiar. They felt like foreigners.</div>

<div class="line_en">The great thing about language is that you can just as easily use it to do the opposite: convince people that they are the same. Racism teaches us that we are different because of the color of our skin. But because racism is stupid, it's easily tricked. If you're racist and you meet someone who doesn't look like you, the fact that he can't speak like you reinforces your racist preconceptions: He's different, less intelligent. A brilliant scientist can come over the border from Mexico to live in America, but if he speaks in broken English, people say, "Eh, I don't trust this guy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过反过来说，语言也可以让人们相信彼此是一样的。种族主义说我们因为肤色的不同而不同。但种族主义者很蠢，很容易被骗。如果你是个种族主义者，你遇到一个和你长得不一样的人，恰巧他说话的方式和你也不一样，这只会加深你的种族偏见：他和我不一样，智商低。假设一个很厉害的科学家从墨西哥移民到美国，但他的英文说得磕磕巴巴，人们会说：“呃，我不相信他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says "We're the same." A language barrier says "We're different." The architects of apartheid understood this. Part of the effort to divide black people was to make sure we were separated not just physically but by language as well. In the Bantu schools, children were only taught in their home language. Zulu kids learned in Zulu. Tswana kids learned in Tswana. Because of this, we'd fall into the trap the government had set for us and fight among ourselves, believing that we were different.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="语言中蕴含着你的身份和文化背景，或至少感觉上是这样的。如果我们说一样的语言，那么“我们就是一样的”。如果说不一样的语言，“那么我们就是不同的”。种族隔离制度的设计者深谙此道。为了将黑人区隔开，光是从物理空间上分开不够，还要用语言来区分。班图人的学校只教孩子们说班图语。祖鲁孩子们学祖鲁语。茨瓦纳孩子们学茨瓦纳语。就这样，我们掉进了政府的圈套之中，彼此攻击，开始认为我们是不同的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
