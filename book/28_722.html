<div class="line_en">Almost from the minute we agreed it would be okay for him to run, Barack became a kind of human blur, a pixelated version of the guy I knew -- a man who quite suddenly had to be everywhere all at once, driven by and beholden to the force of the larger effort. There was not quite a year until the primary contests got started, beginning in Iowa. Barack had to quickly hire staff, woo the types of donors who could write big checks, and figure out how to introduce his candidacy in the most resonant way possible. The goal was to get on people's radar and stay there right through Election Day. Campaigns could be won and lost on their earliest moves.</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole operation would be overseen by the two deeply invested Davids -- Axelrod and Plouffe. Axe, as everyone called him, had a soft voice, a courtly manner, and a brushy mustache that ran the length of his top lip. He'd worked as a reporter for the Chicago Tribune before turning to political consulting and would lead the messaging and media for Barack. Plouffe, who at thirty-nine had a boyish smile and a deep love of numbers and strategy, would manage the overall campaign. The team was growing rapidly, with experienced people recruited to look after the finances and handle advance planning on events.</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone had the wisdom to suggest that Barack might want to formally announce his candidacy in Springfield. Everyone agreed that it would be a fitting, middle-of-America backdrop for what we hoped would be a different kind of campaign -- one led from the ground up, largely by people new to the political process. This was the cornerstone of Barack's hope. His years as a community organizer had shown him how many people felt unheard and disenfranchised within our democracy. Project VOTE! had helped him see what was possible if those people were empowered to participate. His run for president would be an even bigger test of that idea. Would his message work on a larger scale? Would enough people come out to help? Barack knew he was an unusual candidate. He wanted to run an unusual campaign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人明智地建议贝拉克在斯普林菲尔德正式宣布参选。所有人都赞成这个提议，因为美国中部是一个参与竞选的与众不同的绝佳背景，我们希望进行的是一场自下而上的竞选，参与者大都是政治新手。这是贝拉克希望的基石。多年做社区组织工作的经历让他看到，许多人觉得自己的声音没有被人听到，觉得自己在美国人的民主中被剥夺了公民权，而“投票项目”帮助他看到，如果这些人都去投票会带来什么样的可能。他竞选总统是对这个想法的更大的考验。他传递出的信息会在更大的范围内起作用吗？会有足够多的人前来投票吗？贝拉克知道他是一个另类的候选人，他想要进行一场另类的竞选。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The plan became for Barack to make his announcement from the steps of the Old State Capitol, a historic landmark that would of course be more visually appealing than any convention center or arena. But it also put him outdoors, in the middle of Illinois, in the middle of February, when temperatures were often below freezing. The decision struck me as well-intentioned but generally impractical, and it did little to build my confidence in the campaign team that now more or less ran our lives. I was unhappy about it, imagining the girls and me trying to smile through blowing snow or frigid winds, Barack trying to appear invigorated instead of chilled. I thought about all the people who would decide to stay home that day rather than stand out in the cold for hours. I was a midwesterner: I knew the weather could ruin everything. I knew also that Barack couldn't afford an early flop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按照计划，贝拉克要在老州议会大厦宣布参选，这处历史地标建筑当然要比任何一个会议中心或者舞台更有视觉冲击力。但那是在户外，在伊利诺伊州中部，在2月中旬，气温经常在冰点以下。这个决定的初衷是好的，但我觉得不现实，对建立竞选团队的信心，没有丝毫帮助。当时我们的生活基本都被这个团队操控着。我心里很不高兴，想象着这样一个画面：女儿们和我在飞雪和寒风中努力保持微笑，贝拉克努力表现得精神抖擞而非冻得发抖。我想到那天会有很多人决定留在家里而非在寒风中站上几个小时。我是中西部人，我知道天气会搞砸一切。我也知道贝拉克绝不能一开始就走错。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About a month earlier, Hillary Clinton had declared her own candidacy, brimming with confidence. John Edwards, Kerry's former running mate from North Carolina, had launched his campaign a month prior to that, speaking in front of a New Orleans home that had been ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. In all, a total of nine Democrats would throw their hats into the ring. The field would be crowded and the competition fierce.</div>

<div class="line_en">In what was probably a subconscious act of self-preservation, my focus shifted toward something I could control, which was finding acceptable headwear for Malia and Sasha for the announcement.

<div class="line_en">As the announcement day neared, I began making harried after-work trips to the department stores at Water Tower Place, rifling through the dwindling midseason supply of winter wear, hunting the clearance racks in vain. It wasn't long before I became less concerned with making sure Malia and Sasha looked like the daughters of a future president than making sure they looked like they at least had a mother. Finally, on what was probably my third outing, I found some -- two knit hats, white for Malia and pink for Sasha, both in a women's size small, which ended up fitting snugly on Malia's head but drooping loosely around Sasha's little five-year-old face. They weren't high fashion, but they looked cute enough, and more important they'd keep the girls warm regardless of what the Illinois winter had in store. It was a small triumph, but a triumph nonetheless, and it was mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着宣布日的临近，我开始在下班后匆忙地跑到水塔商厦的百货公司。冬天已经过去了一半儿，我在越来越少的冬衣中翻来翻去，在清仓的架子上找来找去，一直没找到合适的帽子。我早已不关心玛利亚和萨沙看起来是否像是未来总统的女儿，而只想确保她们看起来至少有个妈妈。终于，在我第三次出去时，我找到了两顶针织帽，白色的给玛利亚，粉色的给萨沙，都是女士小号。玛利亚那顶戴着正好，但萨沙那顶有点大，松松垮垮地盖住了她那张五岁的小脸。帽子并不是最新款，但看起来很漂亮，更重要的是，不管伊利诺伊州的冬天有多冷，它们都会让我的女儿暖暖和和的。这虽是一个小小的胜利，但毕竟也是一场胜利，而且是我的胜利。">查看中文翻译</div>

The air temperature sat at about twelve degrees, with a light breeze blowing. Our family had arrived in Springfield the previous day, staying in a three-room suite at a downtown hotel, on a floor that had been rented out entirely by the campaign to house a couple dozen of our family and friends who'd traveled down from Chicago as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">Already, we were beginning to experience the pressures of a national campaign. Barack's announcement had inadvertently been scheduled for the same day as the State of the Black Union, a forum organized each year by the public-broadcasting personality Tavis Smiley, who was evidently angry about it. He'd made his displeasure clear to the campaign staff, suggesting that the move showed a disregard for the African American community and would end up hurting Barack's candidacy. I was surprised that the first shots fired at us came from within the black community. Then, just a day ahead of the announcement, Rolling Stone published a piece on Barack that included the reporter making a visit to Trinity Church in Chicago. We were still members there, though our attendance had dropped off significantly after the girls were born. The piece quoted from an angry and inflammatory sermon the Reverend Jeremiah Wright had delivered many years earlier regarding the treatment of blacks in our country, intimating that Americans cared more about maintaining white supremacy than they did about God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们已经开始感受到全国竞选的压力了。很不巧，贝拉克宣布参选的那天跟黑人联合大会的日子撞车了，这个大会每年召开一次，召集人是公共广播电台的知名主持人塔维斯·斯迈利，他对此显然很生气。他向竞选团队表达了他的不满，认为这个举动显示出竞选团队对黑人社群的不尊重，最终会影响贝拉克的选情。我很惊讶，向我们开出的第一枪居然来自黑人社群。而且，就在宣布日的前一天，《滚石》杂志刊登了一篇关于贝拉克的文章，记者到芝加哥的三一教堂进行了采访。我们仍然是那里的成员，但是自从女儿们出生后，我们去教堂的次数已经大大减少。那篇文章引用了耶利米·莱特牧师多年前发表的一篇充满愤怒且极具煽动性的布道文，内容是关于我们美国黑人受到的不公正待遇，其中暗示相较于尊崇上帝，美国人更在意维护白人至上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That morning, it hit me that we'd reached the no-turning-back moment. We were literally now putting our family in front of the American people. The day was meant to be a massive kickoff party for the campaign, one for which everyone had spent weeks preparing. And like every paranoid host, I couldn't shake the fear that when the time finally came, no one would show up. Unlike Barack, I could be a doubter. I still held on to the worries I'd had since childhood. What if we're not good enough? Maybe everything we'd been told was an exaggeration. Maybe Barack was less popular than his people believed. Maybe it just wasn't yet his time. I tried to shove all doubts aside as we arrived through a side entrance to a staging area inside the old capitol, still unable to see what was going on out front. So that I could get a briefing from the staff, I handed Sasha and Malia off to my mother and Kaye Wilson --"Mama Kaye"-- a former mentor of Barack's who had in recent years stepped into the role of second grandmother to our girls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨，我突然意识到，我们到了一个无法再回头的时刻。我们真的要把全家人放到美国人民面前了。那天是竞选开始的一个大派对，所有人用了几周为它做准备。像每一个爱操心的东道主一样，我一直在担心，那一刻最终到来的时候，一个人都不会出现。和贝拉克不同，我是个怀疑论者。我心里依然有那个从小就有的焦虑。万一我们不够优秀呢？可能我们被告知的一切都是夸大其词。可能贝拉克没有人们认为的那样受欢迎，可能他的时机还没到。当我们通过一个侧门走到老州议会大厦的舞台区时，我试图把所有怀疑都推到一边。我看不到舞台前面的情况，想从工作人员那里了解一下，于是把萨沙和玛利亚交给我的母亲和凯伊·威尔逊—“凯伊妈妈”，她是贝拉克之前的一位导师，最近一些年已经逐渐成为我们女儿的第二个祖母。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While the profile itself was largely positive, the cover line of the magazine read, "The Radical Roots of Barack Obama," which we knew would quickly get weaponized by the conservative media. It was a disaster in the making, especially on the eve of the campaign launch and especially because Reverend Wright was scheduled to lead the invocation ahead of Barack's speech. Barack had to make a difficult call, phoning the pastor and asking whether he'd be willing to step back from the spotlight, giving us a private backstage blessing instead. Reverend Wright's feelings were hurt, Barack said, but he also seemed to understand the stakes, leading us to believe that he'd be supportive without dwelling on his disappointment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="文章本身基本上是正面的，但是杂志封面上写着一行大字：贝拉克·奥巴马的激进根源—我们知道这很快就会成为保守派媒体的武器。这会发展成一场灾难，特别是在竞选开启前夕，特别是莱特牧师还被安排在贝拉克发表演讲之前做开场祈祷。贝拉克不得不给牧师打了一通艰难的电话，问他是否可以不走到台前，而是在后台私下为我们祝福。贝拉克说，莱特牧师的感情受到了伤害，但是他也明白其中的风险，这让我们相信他会支持我们，不会只顾自己的失望感受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crowd was looking good, I was told. People had started gathering before dawn. The plan was for Barack to walk out first, and then the girls and I would join him a few moments later on the platform, climbing a few stairs before turning to wave at the crowd. I'd made it clear already that we would not stay onstage for his twenty-minute address. It was too much to ask two little kids to sit still and pretend to be interested. If they looked at all bored, if either one sneezed or started fidgeting, it would do nothing for Barack's cause. The same went for me. I knew the stereotype I was meant to inhabit, the immaculately groomed doll-wife with the painted-on smile, gazing bright-eyed at her husband, as if hanging on every word. This was not me and never would be. I could be supportive, but I couldn't be a robot.</div>

Many had yet to believe that a black man could win in predominantly white areas, which meant they'd often go for the safer bet, the next-best thing. One facet of the challenge for Barack was to shift black voters away from their long-standing allegiance to Bill Clinton, who'd shown unusual ease with the African American community and formed many connections there as a result. Barack had already built goodwill with a diverse range of constituents throughout Illinois, including in the rural white farm areas in the southern part of the state. He'd already proven that he could reach all demographics, but many people didn't yet understand this about him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our hopes were pinned on Iowa. We had to win it or otherwise stand down. Mostly rural and more than 90 percent white, it was a curious state to serve as the nation's political bellwether and was maybe not the most obvious place for a black guy based in Chicago to try to define himself, but this was the reality. Iowa went first in presidential primaries and had since 1972. Members of both parties cast their votes at precinct-level meetings -- caucuses -- in the middle of winter, and the whole nation paid attention. If you got yourself noticed in Des Moines and Dubuque, your candidacy automatically mattered in Orlando and L. A. We knew, too, that if we made a good showing in Iowa, it would send the message to black voters nationally that it was okay to start believing. The fact that Barack was a senator in neighboring Illinois, giving him some name recognition and a familiarity with the area's broader issues, had convinced David Plouffe that we had at least a small advantage in Iowa -- one upon which we would now try to capitalize.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的希望系于爱荷华州。我们必须拿下它，否则就要退出竞选。爱荷华州大多是农业区，居民超过百分之九十是白人。作为国家的政治风向标，这是一个不寻常的州，那里也许并不是一个来自芝加哥的黑人尝试定义自己的绝佳之地，但这就是现实。爱荷华州是总统初选的第一站，从1972年以来就是如此。隆冬时节，两党成员会在选区会议即党内预选上投票，吸引整个国家的注意力。如果你在得梅因和迪比克引起了关注，你的参选资格在奥兰多和洛杉矶就会自动变得重要。我们也清楚，如果我们在爱荷华州表现不错，就会向全国的黑人选民传递一个信息：可以有信心了。贝拉克是伊利诺伊州的参议员，这让他在临近的爱荷华州有一些知名度，而且他大致了解那里的情况，这使大卫·普洛夫相信，我们至少在爱荷华州拥有一些优势—我们要努力利用这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The scrutiny of Barack would be extra intense, the lens always magnified. We knew that as a black candidate he couldn't afford any sort of stumble. He'd have to do everything twice as well. For Barack, and for every candidate not named Clinton, the only hope for winning the nomination was to raise a lot of money and start spending it fast, hoping that a strong performance in the earliest primaries would give the campaign enough momentum to slingshot past the Clinton machine.</div>

<div class="line_en">This meant that I would be going to Iowa almost weekly, catching early-morning United Airlines flights out of O'Hare, making three or four campaign stops in a day. I told Plouffe early on that while I was happy to campaign, part of the deal had to be that they'd get me back to Chicago in time to put the girls to bed at night. My mother had agreed to cut down her hours at work so that she could be around for the kids more when I was traveling. Barack, too, would be logging many hours in Iowa, though we'd rarely show up there -- or anywhere -- together. I was now what they call a surrogate for the candidate, a stand-in who could meet with voters at a community center in Iowa City while he campaigned in Cedar Falls or raised money in New York. Only when it really seemed important would the campaign staff put the two of us in the same room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack now traveled with a swarm of attentive aides, and I was allotted funds to hire a two-person staff of my own, which given that I planned to volunteer only two or three days per week to the campaign seemed like plenty to me. I had no idea what I needed in terms of support. Melissa Winter, who was my first hire and would later become my chief of staff, had been recommended by Barack's scheduler. She'd worked in Senator Joe Lieberman's office on Capitol Hill and had been involved in his 2000 vice presidential campaign. I interviewed Melissa -- blond, bespectacled, and in her late thirties -- in our living room in Chicago and was impressed by her irreverent wit and almost obsessive devotion to detail, which I knew would be important as I tried to integrate campaigning into my already-busy schedule at the hospital. She was sharp, highly efficient, and quick moving. She'd also been around politics enough to be unfazed by its intensity and pace. Just a few years younger than I was, Melissa also felt more like a peer and an ally than the much younger campaign workers I'd encountered. She would become someone I trusted -- as I do still, to this day -- with literally every part of my life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack's advisers had tried to demystify Iowa for me, explaining that my mission was primarily to spend time with Democrats in every corner of the state, addressing small groups, energizing volunteers, and trying to win over leaders in the community. Iowans, they said, took their role as political trendsetters seriously. They did their homework on candidates and asked serious policy questions. Accustomed as they were to months of careful courtship, they were not likely to be won over with a smile and a handshake, either. Some would hold out for months, I was told, expecting a face-to-face conversation with every candidate before finally committing to one. What they didn't tell me was what my message in Iowa was supposed to be. I was given no script, no talking points, no advice. I figured I'd just work it out for myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">My first solo campaign event took place in early April inside a modest home in Des Moines. A few dozen people had collected in the living room, sitting on couches and folding chairs that had been brought in for the occasion, while others sat cross-legged on the floor. As I scanned the room, preparing to speak, what I observed probably shouldn't have surprised me, but it did, at least a little. Laid out on the end tables were the same sorts of white crocheted doilies that my grandmother Shields used to have at her house. I spotted porcelain figurines that looked just like the ones Robbie had kept on her shelves downstairs from us on Euclid Avenue. A man in the front row was smiling at me warmly. I was in Iowa, but I had the distinct feeling of being at home. Iowans, I was realizing, were like Shieldses and Robinsons. They didn't suffer fools. They didn't trust people who put on airs. They could sniff out a phony a mile away.</div>

The asthma was under control, but the doctor alerted me to something else -- Malia's body mass index, a measure of health that factors together height, weight, and age, was beginning to creep up. It wasn't a crisis, he said, but it was a trend to take seriously. If we didn't change some habits, it could become a real problem over time, increasing her risk for high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Seeing the stricken look on my face, he assured me that the problem was both common and solvable. The rate of childhood obesity was rising all around the country.

<div class="line_en">Talking further with the doctor, I began to see the pattern we were in. With Barack gone all the time, convenience had become the single most important factor in my choices at home. We'd been eating out more. With less time to cook, I often picked up takeout on my way home from work. In the mornings, I packed the girls' lunch boxes with Lunchables and Capri Suns. Weekends usually meant a trip to the McDonald's drive-through window after ballet and before soccer. None of this, our doctor said, was out of the ordinary, or even all that terrible in isolation.

He was a bit of an outlier in the Obama household -- a white twenty-six-year-old with a shiny shaved head and a perpetual five o'clock shadow -- but the girls took to his corny jokes as quickly as they took to his cooking. He showed them how to chop carrots and blanch greens, shifting our family away from the fluorescent sameness of the grocery store and toward the rhythm of the seasons. He could be reverent about the arrival of fresh peas in springtime or the moment raspberries came ripe in June. He waited until peaches were rich and plump before serving them to the girls, knowing that then they might actually compete with candy. Sam also had an educated perspective on food and health issues, namely how the food industry marketed processed foods to families in the name of convenience and how that was having severe public health consequences. I was intrigued, realizing that it tied in to some of what I'd seen while working for the hospital system, and to the compromises I'd made myself as a working mother trying to feed her family.</div>

<div class="line_en">I never expected to be the sort of person who hired someone to come into my house and prepare meals for my family. It felt a little bougie, the kind of thing that would elicit a skeptical side eye from my South Side relatives. Barack, he of the Datsun with the hole in the floor, wasn't hot on the idea, either; it didn't fit with his ingrained community-organizer frugality, nor the image he wanted to promote as a presidential candidate. But to me, it felt like the only sane choice. Something had to give. No one else could run my programs at the hospital. No one else could campaign as Barack Obama's wife. No one could fill in as Malia and Sasha's mother at bedtime. But maybe Sam Kass could cook some dinners for us.</div>

When I spoke to reporters, they rarely asked about my work. They inserted "Harvard-educated" in their description of me, but generally left it at that. A couple of news outlets had published stories speculating that I'd been promoted at the hospital not due to my own hard work and merit but because of my husband's growing political stature, which was painful to read. In April, Melissa called me one day at home to let me know about a snarky column written by Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. In it, she referred to me as a "princess of South Chicago," suggesting that I was emasculating Barack when I spoke publicly about how he didn't pick up his socks or put the butter back in the fridge. For me, it had always been important that people see Barack as human and not as some otherworldly savior. Maureen Dowd would have preferred, apparently, that I adopt the painted-on smile and the adoring gaze. I found it odd and sad that such a harsh critique would come from another professional woman, someone who had not bothered to get to know me but was now trying to shape my story in a cynical way.</div>

That he wouldn't put his hand over his heart during the national anthem. That he had a close friend who was a domestic terrorist from the 1970s.

After being served some questionable food at otherwise charming roadside diners, I learned to value the bland certainty of a McDonald's cheeseburger. On bumpy drives between small towns, I learned how to protect my clothing from spills by seeking out snacks that would crumble rather than drip, knowing that I couldn't be photographed with a dollop of hummus on my dress. I trained myself to limit my water intake, understanding there was rarely time for bathroom breaks on the road.

An hour or so later, I spotted Sasha and panicked. Her cheeks, nose, and forehead had been covered, meticulously and comprehensively, in black and white face paint. She'd been transformed into a panda bear, and she was thrilled about it. My mind went instantly to the magazine crew waiting for us, the schedule that would now be thrown off.

Our organization was powered by the idealism and energy of twenty-two- to twenty-five-year-olds who had dropped everything and driven themselves to Iowa to join the campaign, each one carrying some permutation of the gene that had compelled Barack to take the organizing job in Chicago all those years ago. They had a spirit and skill that hadn't yet been accounted for in the polls. I felt it every time I visited, a surge of hope that came from interacting with true believers who were spending four or five hours every evening knocking on doors and calling voters, building networks of supporters in even the tiniest and most conservative towns, while learning by heart the intricacies of my husband's stance on hog confinements or his plan to fix the immigration system.</div>

The climate described from inside sterile urban studios was not the one I was encountering in the church halls and rec centers of Iowa. The pundits weren't meeting teams of high school "Barack Stars," who volunteered after football practice or drama club. They weren't holding hands with a white grandmother who imagined a better future for her mixed-race grandchildren. Nor did they seem aware of the proliferating giant that was our field organization. We were in the process of building a massive grassroots campaign network -- ultimately two hundred staffers in thirty-seven offices -- the largest in the history of the Iowa caucuses.</div>

They were connecting voters more directly to their democracy, whether through the field office down the street or a website through which they could organize their own meetings and phone banks. As Barack often said, what we were doing wasn't just about a single election. It was about making politics better for the future -- less money-driven, more accessible, and ultimately more hopeful. Even if we didn't end up winning, we were making progress that mattered. One way or another, their work would count.</div>

In Iowa, during a presidential election, it was held in early November, about eight weeks ahead of the January caucuses, and covered by the national media. The premise was that every candidate gave a speech -- with no notes and no teleprompter -- and also tried to bring along as many supporters as possible. It was, in essence, a giant and competitive pep rally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着天气再次转冷，贝拉克知道他只剩最后一个机会扭转爱荷华州的选情，那就是在“杰斐逊－杰克逊纪念日”晚餐会上有亮眼的表现。这是民主党每年在各州都会举行的仪式。在爱荷华州，总统选举期间，它是在11月初举行的，距离1月的党内预选有大约八周时间，全美国媒体都会前来报道。仪式上，每个候选人都要发表演讲—不用笔记和提词器，而且要争取尽可能多的支持者到现场助威。本质上，这是一个候选人之间互相比拼的大规模动员大会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Onstage that night, John Edwards took a shot at Clinton, speaking in veiled terms about sincerity and trustworthiness being important. Grinning, Joe Biden acknowledged the impressive and noisy turnout of Obama supporters with a sardonic "Hello, Chicago!" Hillary, who was fighting a cold, also used the opportunity to go after Barack. " 'Change' is just a word," she said, "if you don't have the strength and experience to make it happen."</div>

<div class="line_en">For months, the cable news commentators had doubted that Iowans would stand up for Barack at caucus time, insinuating that as dynamic and unusual a candidate as he was, he still wouldn't manage to convert the enthusiasm into votes. The crowd at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner was our answer to this. About three thousand of our supporters had driven in from all over the state, showing that we were both organized and active -- stronger than anyone thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack was the last to speak that night, delivering a rousing defense of his central message -- that our country had arrived at a defining moment, a chance to step beyond not just the fear and failures of the Bush administration but the polarized way politics had been waged long before, including, of course, during the Clinton administration. "I don't want to spend the next year or the next four years refighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s," he said. "I don't want to pit Red America against Blue America, I want to be the president of the United States of America."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the days after Christmas, with just a week or so left in the Iowa campaign, it seemed as if half of the South Side had migrated to the deep freeze of Des Moines. My mother and Mama Kaye showed up. My brother and Kelly came, bringing their kids. Sam Kass was there. Valerie, who'd joined the campaign earlier in the fall as one of Barack's advisers, was there, along with Susan and my posse of girlfriends and their husbands and children. I was touched when colleagues from the hospital showed up, friends of ours from Sidley &amp; Austin, law professors who'd taught with Barack. And, in step with the use-every-moment ethic of the campaign, they all signed on to help make the final push, reporting to a local field office, knocking on doors in zero-degree weather, talking up Barack, and reminding people to caucus. The campaign was further reinforced by hundreds of others who'd traveled to Iowa from around the country for the final week, staying in the spare bedrooms of local supporters, heading out each day into even the smallest towns and down the most tucked away of gravel roads.</div>

One night, I opened the door, hoping to flop on the bed for a few moments of silence, only to find our room strewn with kitchen utensils.

Maybe, I thought to myself, everything Barack had been talking about for all those years really was possible.
