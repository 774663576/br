<div class="line_en">In other circumstances I suppose it might have seemed strange that I, Lou Clark, a girl who had rarely been more than a bus ride from her home town in twenty years, was now flying to her third country in less than a week. But I packed an overnight case with the swift efficiency of an air stewardess, rejecting all but the barest necessities. Treena ran around silently fetching any other things she thought I might need, and then we headed downstairs. We stopped halfway down. Mum and Dad were already in the hall, standing side by side in the ominous way they used to do when we sneaked back late from a night out.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不行。”母亲说，她的声音里透着一种不寻常的威严。“没有但是。我一直在想这件事，想你告诉我们的想法。这是不道德的。你要是纠缠进去，你就是在帮助一个人杀死自己，会有数不清的麻烦事找上你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Do you think we should shove him off to Dignitas too?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不确定你能。他是你的朋友，露易莎，一个有着长远美好人生的年轻人。你不能参与进去。你居然考虑这个，真让我震惊。”母亲的话语有一种陌生的生硬味道，“我把你拉扯大，不是为了让你帮助别人结束他的生命！你会结束外公的生命吗？你觉得我们也应该把他送去‘尊严’吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, he isn't. He can't do what he used to. But his life is precious. Just as Will's is precious."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="小小的门厅出现了沉默。母亲盯着我，就像她不知道我是谁。我朝她迈进了一步，想让她明白。不过她向后退了一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'd sleep at night because I trust Will to know what is right for him, and because what has been the worst thing for him has been losing the ability to make a single decision, to do a single thing for himself…" I looked at my parents, trying to make them understand. "I'm not a child. I love him. I love him, and I shouldn't have left him alone, and I can't bear not being there and not knowing what… what he's…" I swallowed. "So yes. I'm going.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我晚上能睡得着，因为我相信威尔知道什么对他是正确的，对他来说，最糟糕的事情就是连作一个决定的能力和为他自己做一件事情的能力都失去了……”我看着父母，想让他们理解。“我不是个孩子，我爱他，我爱他。我不能不管他，我也受不了不在那儿，不知道他……”我咽了一口唾沫，“所以是的，我要去。我不需要你们管我或是理解，我会处理。不管你们说什么，我都要去瑞士。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mum? I owe Will. I owe it to him to go. Who do you think got me to apply to college? Who do you think encouraged me to make something of myself, to travel places, to have ambitions? Who changed the way I think about everything? About myself even? Will did. I've done more, lived more, in the last six months than in the last twenty-seven years of my life. So if he wants me to go to Switzerland, then yes, I'm going to go. Whatever the outcome."</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember thinking, as if at a distance, that I had never seen Katrina look so uncertain as she did now. I saw Dad's hand reach out to Mum's arm, whether in reproach or comfort I couldn't tell. My mind went briefly blank. Then almost without knowing what I was doing, I walked slowly down the stairs and past my parents to the front door. And after a second, my sister followed me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't look at her for long -- I was rifling through my handbag, trying to work out what I had forgotten. I kept hearing the sound of Mrs Traynor's voice down the line.

<div class="line_cn" title="我不能老看着她——我在手提包里翻寻，看有没有漏掉什么。特雷纳夫人的声音一路在我耳中翻腾：露易莎，拜托，你能来吗？我知道我们有些分歧，但是请……你现在来至关重要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I arrived in Zurich shortly before midnight. Given the late hour, Mrs Traynor had, as promised, booked me into a hotel at the airport and said she would send a car for me at nine the following morning.

<div class="line_en">I scrambled out of bed just in time to be sick in the little bathroom. I sank down on the tiled floor, my hair sticking to my forehead, my cheek pressed against the cold porcelain. I heard my mother's voice, her protests, and I felt a dark fear creeping over me. I wasn't up to this. I didn't want to fail again. I didn't want to have to watch Will die. With an audible groan, I scrambled up to be sick again.</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't eat. I managed to swallow down a cup of black coffee and showered and dressed, and that took me to 8am. I stared at the pale-green dress I had thrown in last night and wondered if it was appropriate for where I was going. Would everyone wear black? Should I have worn something more vibrant and alive, like the red dress I knew Will liked? Why had Mrs Traynor called me here? I checked my mobile phone, wondering whether I could call Katrina. It would be seven in the morning there now. But she would probably be dressing Thomas, and the thought of talking to Mum was too much. I put on some make-up and then sat down by the window, and the minutes ticked slowly past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能吃东西，只勉强咽下了一杯黑咖啡。洗了澡，换了衣服，时间就到了八点。我盯着昨晚扔进来的那件浅绿色的裙子，不知道穿这个是否合适。每个人都会穿黑色的衣服吗？我要穿一件色彩鲜明充满活力的衣服，像威尔喜欢的那件红裙子吗？为什么特雷纳夫人叫我到这儿来？我看了一下手机，不知道是否要给卡特丽娜打个电话。那儿现在应该是早上七点。不过估计她在给托马斯穿衣服，想到要跟母亲说话我就有点堵得慌。我抹了点化妆品，在窗边坐了下来，时间一分一分缓慢地消逝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I couldn't bear being in the little room any longer, I threw the last of my things into my bag and left. I would buy a newspaper, and wait in the lobby. It couldn't be worse than sitting in my room with the silence or the satellite news channel and the suffocating darkness of the curtains. It was as I was passing reception that I saw the computer terminal, discreetly placed in a corner. It was marked: For Use Of Guests. Please Ask At Reception.</div>

Two people who shouldn't have met, and who didn't like each other much when they did, but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other. And I told him of the adventures they had, the places they had gone, and the things I had seen that I had never expected to. I conjured for him electric skies and iridescent seas and evenings full of laughter and silly jokes. I drew a world for him, a world far from a Swiss industrial estate, a world in which he was still somehow the person he had wanted to be. I drew the world he had created for me, full of wonder and possibility. I let him know a hurt had been mended in a way that he couldn't have known, and for that alone there would always be a piece of me indebted to him. And as I spoke I knew these would be the most important words I would ever say and that it was important that they were the right words, that they were not propaganda, an attempt to change his mind, but respectful of what Will had said.</div>

I took his arm and wrapped it tightly around me, threading my own arms and legs around him so that we were tightly entwined. I took his hand -- the good one -- and wrapped my fingers in his, kissing the knuckles as I felt him squeeze mine. His body was so familiar to me now. I knew it in a way I had never known Patrick's -- its strengths and vulnerabilities, its scars and scents. I placed my face so close to his that his features became indistinct, and I began to lose myself in them. I stroked his hair, his skin, his brow, with my fingertips, tears sliding unchecked down my cheeks, my nose against his, and all the time he watched me silently, studying me intently as if he were storing each molecule of me away. He was already retreating, withdrawing to somewhere I couldn't reach him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又躺了下来，看着他。我看见了门上的钟，突然有一种时间飞逝的感觉。我拉过他的胳膊，紧紧缠绕着自己，我的手脚都缠绕着他，我们就这样紧密地纠缠在一起。我把我的手指裹进他的那只还能动的手，他紧紧握着我的手。我吻着他的指关节，现在我对他的身体如此熟悉。从某方面来说，我从没对帕特里克的身体如此熟悉——他的力量和脆弱，伤疤和气味。我的脸紧贴着他的脸，他的面容变得模糊，我迷失在他的面孔中。我用手指抚摸他的头发、他的肌肤、他的眉毛，眼泪止不住地从我脸上滑下，我的鼻子贴着他的鼻子，他一直默默地注视着我，目不转睛地看着我，似乎要把我身上的每个细胞都珍藏起来。他已经在撤退，退到一个我们无法触及的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I realized I was afraid of living without him. How is it you have the right to destroy my life, I wanted to demand of him, but I'm not allowed a say in yours?</div>

<div class="line_en">I kissed him, trying to bring him back. I kissed him and let my lips rest against his so that our breath mingled and the tears from my eyes became salt on his skin, and I told myself that, somewhere, tiny particles of him would become tiny particles of me, ingested, swallowed, alive, perpetual. I wanted to press every bit of me against him. I wanted to will something into him. I wanted to give him every bit of life I felt and force him to live.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我吻他，想让他回过神。我吻他，吻停在他的唇上，我们的呼吸混合在一起，我眼中的泪水变成他皮肤上的盐粒。我告诉自己，在某个地方，他的微粒会变成我的微粒，被吸取、被咽下，永远存活。我想把我的每一点都压在他身上，我想要给他一些东西；我想要给予他我感受到的每一丝生活热情，让他活下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't say how long we stayed like that. I was dimly aware of soft conversation outside, of the shuffle of shoes, a distant church bell ringing in some far-off place. Finally, I felt him loosen a great breath, almost a shudder, and he drew his head back just an inch so that we could see each other clearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说不清我们这样待了多久。我隐隐约约感觉到了外面轻声的谈话，鞋子拖来拖去的声音，远处模糊的教堂钟声。最后，我感觉他长长地舒了一口气，几乎一阵颤动，然后他的头往后退了一英寸，这样我们可以清楚地看到彼此。">查看中文翻译</div>
