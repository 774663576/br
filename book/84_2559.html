<div class="line_en">A stone gate barred the entrance to Trinity College. Cut into the gate was a small wooden door. I stepped through it. A porter in a black overcoat and bowler hat showed me around the college, leading me through Great Court, the largest of the courtyards. We walked through a stone passageway and into a covered corridor whose stone was the color of ripe wheat.</div>

<div class="line_en">I dressed in dark colors for my first lecture, hoping I wouldn't stand out, but even so I didn't think I looked like the other students. I certainly didn't sound like them, and not just because they were British. Their speech had a lilting cadence that made me think of singing more than speaking. To my ears they sounded refined, educated; I had a tendency to mumble, and when nervous, to stutter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一堂课我穿了深色衣服，希望自己不会太显眼，但即便如此，我还是觉得自己与其他同学不一样。我说起话来当然不像他们，不仅仅因为他们是英国人。他们的言语节奏轻快、抑扬顿挫，让我觉得像是在唱歌，而不是说话。在我听来，他们说话时文质彬彬，显得受过良好教育；而我说话则倾向于含糊不清，一紧张就结巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We returned to the Great Gate. My room was directly opposite it, up three flights of stairs. After the porter left I stood, bookended by my suitcases, and stared out my little window at the mythic stone gate and its otherworldly battlements. Cambridge was just as I remembered: ancient, beautiful. I was different. I was not a visitor, not a guest. I was a member of the university. My name was painted on the door. According to the paperwork, I belonged here.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So what are Isaiah Berlin's two concepts?" the lecturer asked. Nearly everyone raised a hand. The lecturer called on the student who had studied at Oxford. "Negative liberty," he said, "is the freedom from external obstacles or constraints. An individual is free in this sense if they are not physically prevented from taking action." I was reminded for a moment of Richard, who had always seemed able to recite with exactness anything he'd ever read.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么以赛亚·伯林的两种概念是什么？”老师问。几乎所有同学都举起了手。老师叫了那名来自牛津的学生。“消极自由，”他说，“是不受外部限制或阻碍的自由。此种意义下的自由指一个人的身体不受他人阻碍地行动。”一时之间我想起了理查德，他似乎总能准确无误地把读过的东西背诵出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I chose a seat around the large square table and listened as the two students nearest me discussed the lecture topic, which was Isaiah Berlin's two concepts of liberty.

I had never heard of Isaiah Berlin.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="老师试图澄清这个概念。他说积极自由是自制，由自我掌控的自我统治。他解释说，拥有积极自由就是控制自己的思想，从非理性的恐惧和信仰中解放出来，从上瘾、迷信和所有其他形式的自我强迫中解脱出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery. Marley had written that line a year before his death, while an operable melanoma was, at that moment, metastasizing to his lungs, liver, stomach and brain. I imagined a greedy surgeon with sharp teeth and long, skeletal fingers urging Marley to have the amputation. I shrank from this frightening image of the doctor and his corrupt medicine, and only then did I understand, as I had not before, that although I had renounced my father's world, I had never quite found the courage to live in this one.</div>

The cashier was impatient so I chose at random.

Crimson suede sofas sat cordially next to the stained upholstery love seat my father had dragged in from the dump many years before.

Like Tyler's wife, Stefanie, Kami was an outsider: she was a Mormon, but she was what Dad would have called "mainstream." She thanked Mother for her herbal advice but seemed oblivious to the expectation that she renounce doctors. Donavan had been born in a hospital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德出现在楼梯间。他在爱达荷州州立大学学化学，马上本科毕业。他和妻子卡米以及一个月大的儿子多纳文回家过圣诞节。一年前在他们的婚礼上我见过卡米，我当时为她是那么正常而震惊。和泰勒的妻子斯蒂芬妮一样，卡米也是个局外人：她是一个摩门教徒，但属于父亲所说的“主流”。她谢过母亲给她的草药建议，对母亲让她放弃医生的期望置若罔闻。多纳文是在一家医院出生的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad had always said he wanted to build a room the size of a cruise ship but I'd never thought he'd have the money. I looked to Mother for an explanation but it was Dad who answered. The business was a roaring success, he explained. Essential oils were popular, and Mother had the best on the market. "Our oils are so good," he said, "we've started eating into the profits of the large corporate producers. They know all about them Westovers in Idaho." Dad told me that one company had been so alarmed by the success of Mother's oils, they had offered to buy her out for an astonishing three million dollars. My parents hadn't even considered it. Healing was their calling. No amount of money could tempt them. Dad explained that they were taking the bulk of their profits and reconsecrating them to God in the form of supplies -- food, fuel, maybe even a real bomb shelter. I suppressed a grin. From what I could tell, Dad was on track to become the best-funded lunatic in the Mountain West.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wondered how Richard was navigating the turbulent waters between his normal wife and his abnormal parents. I watched him closely that night, and to me it seemed he was trying to live in both worlds, to be a loyal adherent to all creeds. When my father condemned doctors as minions of Satan, Richard turned to Kami and gave a small laugh, as if Dad were joking. But when my father's eyebrows rose, Richard's expression changed to one of serious contemplation and accord. He seemed in a state of constant transition, phasing in and out of dimensions, unsure whether to be my father's son or his wife's husband.</div>

I poured the distilled water and added the drops from the base formula, then passed the tiny glass bottle through the ring made by my thumb and index fingers, counting to fifty or a hundred, then moving on to the next. Dad came in for a drink of water. He smiled when he saw me.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the afternoons, Shawn and I saddled the horses and fought our way up the mountain, the horses half-jumping to clamber through snowdrifts that reached their bellies. The mountain was beautiful and crisp; the air smelled of leather and pine. Shawn talked about the horses, about their training, and about the colts he expected in the spring, and I remembered that he was always at his best when he was with his horses.</div>

He was lying on the crimson sofa, a Bible resting on his stomach, while Kami and Richard played hymns on the piano. I sat with my laptop on the love seat, near Dad, and listened to the music. I had just begun a message to Drew when something struck the back door. The door burst open, and Emily flew into the room.</div>

She wore no coat, no shoes, nothing but jeans, an old pair I'd left behind, and one of my worn T-shirts. Mother helped her to the sofa, wrapping her in the nearest blanket. Emily bawled, and for several minutes not even Mother could get her to say what had happened. Was everyone all right? Where was Peter?

<div class="line_en">The story came out haltingly, between erratic sobs and the clattering of teeth. From what I could tell, when Emily had gone to Stokes that afternoon to buy groceries, she had returned home with the wrong crackers for Peter. Shawn had exploded. "How can he grow if you can't buy the right food!" he had screamed, then he'd gathered her up and flung her from their trailer, into a snowbank. She'd pounded on the door, begging to be let in, then she'd run up the hillside to the house. I stared at her bare feet as she said this. They were so red, they looked as if they'd been burned.</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked at Kami and felt a tightening in my chest. I resented her for witnessing this. I imagined myself in Emily's place, which was easy to do -- I couldn't stop myself from doing it -- and in a moment I was in a parking lot, laughing my high-pitched cackle, trying to convince the world that my wrist wasn't breaking. Before I knew what I was doing I had crossed the room. I grasped my brother's arm and pulled him with me to the piano. Emily was still sobbing, and I used her sobs to muffle my whispers. I told Kami that what we were witnessing was private, and that Emily would be embarrassed by it tomorrow. For Emily's sake, I said, we should all go to our rooms and leave it in Dad's hands.</div>

How I had opened my mouth when I should have stayed silent, and shut it when I should have spoken out. What was needed was a revolution, a reversal of the ancient, brittle roles we'd been playing out since my childhood.
