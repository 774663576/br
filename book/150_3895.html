<div class="line_en">He was surprised and pleased. One of these days, she thought, he would become quite human. Now that she had learnt something of passion it diverted her to play lightly, like a harpist running his fingers across the strings of his harp, on his affections. She laughed when she saw how she bewildered and confused him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Who would have thought then that within three months they would be on such terms? He had told her since that he was crazy about her on that first evening. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He remembered the dress she wore; it was her wedding dress, and he said she looked like a lily of the valley. She knew that he was in love with her before he told her, and a little frightened she kept him at a distance. He was impetuous and it was difficult. She was afraid to let him kiss her, for the thought of his arms about her made her heart beat so fast. She had never been in love before. It was wonderful. And now that she knew what love was she felt a sudden sympathy for the love that Walter bore her. She teased him, playfully, and saw that he enjoyed it. She had been perhaps a little afraid of him, but now she had more confidence. She chaffed him and it amused her to see the slow smile with which at first he received her banter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁能想到才三个月他们就发展到了这个地步呢？他对她说，跟她初次见面的那个晚上他都快疯了。她是他这辈子见过的最美丽的女人。他对她当晚的穿着记忆犹新，当时她身着新娘的盛装，在他眼里就像峡谷里的一朵百合花。就算他不告诉她，她对他爱上自己也早就心知肚明。不过当时她故意跟他保持了一小段距离，现在她对此还有点吃惊呢。他是那么富于激情，差点让她难以拒绝。她不敢叫他亲吻她，担心一旦被他搂在怀里，她的心脏就会跳得飞快。从前她从未真正恋爱过，原来爱情如此奇妙。这会儿尝到了爱情的滋味，她倒突然对瓦尔特有点同情，虽然他的爱一度折磨着她。她一开始时半开玩笑地戏弄唐生，不想他却十分受用。起初她还有点担心，这下就完全成竹在胸了。她打趣似的取笑他，他一领会了她的意思就笑起来，把她逗得够呛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And when Charlie became her lover the situation between herself and Walter seemed exquisitely absurd. She could hardly look at him, so grave and self-controlled, without laughing. She was too happy to feell unkindly towards him. Except for him, after all, she would never have known Charlie. She had hesitated some time before the final step, not because she did not want to yield to Charlie's passion, her own was equal to his, but because her upbringing and all the conventions of her life intimidated her. She was amazed afterwards (and the final act was due to accident; neither of them had seen the opportunity till it was face to face with them) to discover that she felt in no way different from what she had before. She had expected that it would cause some, she hardly knew what, fantastic change in her so that she would feel like somebody else; and when she had a chance to look at herself in the glass she was bewildered to see the same woman she had seen the day before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理最终成为她的情人时，她和瓦尔特之间的关系似乎令人难以置信。她竟然对持重自制的他也忍不住笑容满面。那正是她心花怒放的时候，对谁都会止不住笑脸的。不过话说回来，要不是有他的话，她也不会认识查理。在最终投入查理的怀抱之前，她迟疑了很长时间。倒不是她不甘臣服在查理的激情之下，因为论激情，她丝毫也不输给他。她骨子里的家教和仁义道德还在作怪。事后她惊奇地发现（他们的结合最终出于偶然，机会的到来出乎两人的预料）她一点没变。她觉得怎么也会有点不同，心里发生了这么大的变化，肯定会让她感觉变成了另外一个人。但是当她偶然坐到镜子跟前的时候，她迷惑地看到镜子里的女人和前一天毫无二致。">查看中文翻译</div>
