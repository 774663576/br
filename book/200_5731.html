<div class="line_en">Signed: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister for Magic The notices had gone up all around the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister for Magic and his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter where Harry went within the castle, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore's flight, and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo's with a pumpkin for a head) it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was. Everybody knew, for instance, that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledore's office and, as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a first-hand account.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres… now Harry's heart was beating fast with excitement… he knew where to go… he ran forwards, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted room…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他到了一间灯火昏暗、像教堂一样高大宽敞的房间里，这里没有别的东西，只有一排排高大的架子，每个架子上都摆满了满是灰尘的小玻璃球…现在哈利激动得心脏猛跳…他知道应该去哪里…他向前跑去，可是在空无一人的巨大房间里，他的脚步没有发出声响…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the Department of Mysteries Harry had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised Occlumency once since their last lesson: there had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left; he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，哈利一整天都在担心，要是斯内普发现自己在昨晚的梦中潜入神秘事务司后走了那么远，真不知道他会说些什么。伴随着一阵阵的内疚，他意识到在上完上一节课后，自己一次都没练习过大脑封闭术：自打邓布利多离开后，发生了那么多的事情；他确信就算自己想清空头脑也办不到。不过他拿不准斯内普是否会接受这个借口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good. Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天，他想在上课时临阵磨枪练习一下，但是毫无用处。每当他默不作声，想摒除自己所有的念头和思绪时，赫敏总要问他哪里不舒服，而且老师在复习课上连珠炮似的提出问题，这种时候毕竟不是清空头脑的最佳时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，一些长着银色翅膀、发出闪耀的粉红色的小猪正从格兰芬多塔楼旁飞过。哈利躺在床上，听到了楼下宿舍里格兰芬多学生赞叹的叫喊声。他想起第二天晚上要去学习大脑封闭术，胃里立刻难受地颤动了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“到这儿来。”哈利说，很高兴自己能有个理由晚些和斯内普见面。他招手示意秋张到对面门厅的角落里去，巨大的沙漏就矗立在那里。格兰芬多的沙漏现在几乎已经见底了。“你还好吗？乌姆里奇没有向你问起D.A．的事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, well," said Harry moodily. He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully; it was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，嗯。”哈利闷闷不乐地说。他确实觉得秋张在挑选朋友时也许应该更谨慎一些；玛丽埃塔仍然在学校医院里，庞弗雷夫人拿她的脓包一点办法也没有，哈利上次听到了这个消息后，稍微消了消气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape's dungeon and, though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利气鼓鼓地走下通向斯内普地下教室的台阶，凭自己的经验，他很清楚如果自己到了那里以后还在生气，斯内普会更容易看透他的思想，可是在到达斯内普的门口以前，他一直想着本来应该和秋张多讲几件有关玛丽埃塔的事情，除此以外，他什么都顾不上去想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道这件事。”马尔福说着，斜眼看着哈利，哈利感到自己脸上火辣辣的。他真愿意付出巨大的代价，只要能够向马尔福大声说出事实真相——也许，更好的办法是，用一个厉害的魔咒打中他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Seething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room.

<div class="line_en">Harry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet?

<div class="line_en">He turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape's desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snape's thoughts… things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape's defences accidentally…</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“还有五分钟！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry's own age. His hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么说，斯内普一定是十五六岁，跟哈利现在的年龄差不多。他那只手在羊皮纸上飞快地左右移动着；比起身旁离他最近的那几个人至少多写了一英尺，而且他的字迹又小又密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper: DEFENCE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS -- ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL.</div>

<div class="line_en">Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James's eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did, his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.</div>

<div class="line_en">So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere, too… and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbour's paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters "L. E.'. What did they stand for?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样看来，虫尾巴一定也在附近的什么地方…果然，哈利片刻之间就发现了他：那个个头不大、长着鼠灰色头发的尖鼻子男生。虫尾巴显得有些焦虑，他啃着手指甲，低头盯着自己的试卷，脚尖在地上蹭来蹭去。他还时不时满怀希望地瞟一眼邻桌学生的试卷。哈利盯着虫尾巴看了一会儿，然后又把目光转向了詹姆，现在他正在一小块羊皮纸上随手乱涂乱画。他已经画好了一个金色飞贼，现在正描画着“L.E．”这两个字母。它们代表什么意思呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this girl -- Harry's stomach gave another pleasurable squirm -- was Remus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: as he reread his answers, he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又是一阵兴奋冲击着哈利，他看到小天狼星向詹姆翘起了大拇指。小天狼星懒洋洋地靠在椅子上，显得很自在，他的身体向后仰着，只用椅子的两条腿着地。他非常英俊，黑色的头发垂在眼前，不经意地带出几分典雅，不管是詹姆的头发还是哈利的头发，可从来都没有这份典雅。一个坐在小天狼星身后的女生正满怀期待地注视着他，可他好像没有注意到。在这个女生所在的那一排，隔着两个座位——哈利高兴得胃里又是一阵蠕动——是莱姆斯卢平。他显得相当苍白、憔悴（是不是快到月圆的日子了？），正全神贯注地投入考试：他重新读了读自己的答案，用羽毛笔的笔头搔者下巴，微微皱着眉头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close by, still buried in his exam questions -- but this was Snape's memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any further. To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. By keeping a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the Snitch, letting it zoom further and further away, almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry wondered why James didn't tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy, and he also kept looking over at the girls by the water's edge.</div>

<div class="line_en">They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry, Ron and Hermione had once spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass. Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the OWL paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree. The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting, with their shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water.</div>

Then, with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head-over-heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of Snape's dungeon and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape's desk in the shadowy, present-day Potion master's study.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen. What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him; it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him.</div>
