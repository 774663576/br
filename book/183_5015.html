<div class="line_en">Slowly the door opened again and out there came a figure as tall and straight as the girl's but not so slender. It carried no light but light seemed to come from it. As it came nearer, Lucy saw that it was like an old man. His silver beard came down to his bare feet in front and his saver hair hung down to his heels behind and his robe appeared to be made from the fleece of silver sheep. He looked so mild and grave that once more all the travellers rose to their feet and stood in silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那扇门慢慢又打开了，走出一个人，跟那个姑娘一样又高又挺，不过没那么细长。也没带着灯火，不过仿佛全身都发着光。但等此人走近，露茜才看出像是个老人。他的银须飘垂到身前的光脚上，银发则飘垂到背后的脚跟，一袭银袍看上去像是银羊毛纺制的。他神情非常慈祥庄严，这一行人不由再次默默起立。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the old man came on without speaking to the travellers and stood on the other side of the table opposite to his daughter. Then both of them held up their arms before them and turned to face the east. In that position the began to sing. I wish I could write down the song, but one who was present could remember it. Lucy said afterwards that it was high, almost shrill, but very beautiful, cold kind of song, an early morning kind of song. And they sang, the grey clouds lifted from the eastern sky a the white patches 'grew bigger and bigger till it was white, and the sea began to shine like silver. And long afterwards (but those two sang all the time) the east began to turn red and at last, unclouded, the sun came up out the sea and its long level ray shot down the length of the table on the gold and silver sand on the Stone Knife.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once or twice before, the Narnians had wondered whether the sun at its rising did not look bigger in these seas than it had looked at home. This time they we certain. There was no mistaking it. And the brightness its ray on the dew and on the table was far beyond an. morning brightness they had ever seen. And as Edmu said afterwards, "Though lots of things happened on that trip which sound more exciting, that moment was really the most exciting." For now they knew that they had truly come to the beginning of the End of the World.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这几个纳尼亚人以前有一两回心里总想知道这一带海面上升起的太阳看上去是不是跟国内一样大。这回他们肯定了。一点没错。照在露水和桌上的阳光远比他们所曾见过的任何早晨的曙光更亮得多。正如事后爱德蒙所说的：“虽然那次旅程一路上碰到过不少听起来更激动人心的事，那一时刻倒的确是最最激动人心的。”因为现在他们知道他们确实到了世界尽头的起点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then something seemed to be flying at them out of the very centre of the rising sun: but of course one couldn't look steadily in that direction to make sure. But presently the air became full of voices -- voices which took up same song that the Lady and her Father were singing, but in far wilder tones and in a language which no one knew And soon after that the owners of these voices could be seen. They were birds, large and white, and they came hundreds and thousands and alighted on everything; the grass, and the pavement, on the table, on your shoulders, your hands, and your head, till it looked as heavy snow had fallen. For, like snow, they not only make everything white but blurred and blunted all shapes. But Lucy, looking out from between the wings of the birds that covered her, saw one bird fly to the Old Man with something in its beak that looked like a little fruit, unless it was a little live coal, which it might have been, for it was too bright to look at. And the bird laid it in the Old Man's mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，那轮朝阳的中心似乎有什么东西向他们飞来：不过你眼睛当然没法一眨也不眨地看清楚。然而不久空中就都是声音——应和父女俩唱的那支歌的声音，只是声调古怪些，而且唱的语言没人懂。不一会儿就看得见这些歌声是谁的了。原来是鸟，又大又白，成千上万飞来，停在一切上面：草地上、石板地上、桌上、你的肩上、你的头上、你的手上，看上去真像下了场大雪。说是像雪，因为这些鸟不仅把一切都变成白的了，而且把一切东西的形状弄得模模糊糊，看不清楚。可是露茜从遮住她身子的鸟翼间看出去，只见其中一只鸟飞到老人身边，喙里含着什么东西，要不是一块燃烧着的火炭的话，看起来倒像个小果子，八成是火炭，因为亮得你没法正眼看着。那只鸟把这东西放在老人嘴里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the birds stopped their singing and appeared to be very busy about the table. When they rose from it again everything on the table that could be eaten or drunk had disappeared. These birds rose from their meal in their thousands and hundreds and carried away all the things that could not be eaten or drunk, such as bones, rinds, and shells, and took their flight back to the rising sun. But now, because they were not singing, the whir of their wings seemed to set the whole air a tremble. And there was the table pecked clean and empty, and the three old Lords of Narnia still fast asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后那些鸟停止唱歌，在餐桌上显得非常忙碌的样子。但等它们从餐桌上再飞起来的时候，桌上凡是可以吃的、可以喝的都一扫而光了。这些鸟成千上万地吃完又飞走，还把一切吃不得喝不得的东西，比如骨头啊、皮啊、壳啊之类的，统统都带走，飞回朝阳那边。不过，现在因为它们不是在唱歌，所以千万对鸟翼似乎把整个空气都扑腾得直震颤。而桌面上却已被啄食一空，干干净净，三位纳尼亚老爵爷则依然沉睡不醒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“小伙子，我是远在高空中，”老人答，“我是拉曼杜。不过我看你们大眼瞪小眼，没听说过这名字。这也难怪，因为早在你们任何人出生懂事的很久以前，我就不再是一颗星辰了，现在，一切星座都改变了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I am not so old now as I was then. Every morning a bird brings me a fire-berry from the valleys in the Sun, and each fire-berry takes away a little of my age. And when I have become as young as the child that was born yesterday, then I shall take my rising again (for we are at earth's eastern rim) and once more tread the great dance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小姑娘，我是颗退休的星辰，”拉曼杜答，“上回我落下来时都衰老得没法想象了。我被送到这岛上来。现在我已经不像当时那样老了。每天早晨都有一只鸟从太阳的山谷里带给我一枚火果，每吃一枚火果都使我年轻一点。等我像新生儿那样年轻时，就重新升上天（因为我们是在东边地角），又可以遨游太空了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“说起来，情况并不完全相同，”拉曼杜说，“他被贬谪来管理笨蛋并不完全算是退休。这不妨称做惩罚。如果一切太平无事的话，他原可以在冬天的南方上空照耀千万年。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think the same, Reepicheep," replied Caspian. "And even if it were not so, it would break my heart not to go as near the World's End as the Dawn Treader will take us. But I am thinking of the crew. They signed on to seek the seven lords, not to reach the rim of the Earth. If we sail east from here we sail to find the edge, the utter east. And not one knows how far it is. They're brave fellows, but I set signs that some of them are weary of the voyage and long to have our prow pointing to Narnia again. I don't think should take them further without their knowledge an consent. And then there's the poor Lord Rhoop. He's broken man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也是这么想的，雷佩契普，”凯斯宾答，“哪怕不是这么着，如果黎明踏浪者号可以带我们到世界尽头附近，而我们不去，我也会伤心的。不过我替水手们着想一下。他们订约是来寻找七位爵爷的，不是到天涯海角。如果我们从这里往东开，就要开去找天涯，极东地区。谁也不知道路程有多远。他们是勇敢的弟兄，不过我看得出有迹象表明有些人对航海厌倦了，一心盼望我们的船头重新掉向纳尼亚。我想，不通知他们，不征得他们同意，我是万万不能带他们再走远的。而且还有那个可怜的罗普爵爷。他是个万念皆灰的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And there were some standing on the quay who would have given all they had to come with us. It was thought a finer thing then to have a cabin-boy's berth on the Dawn Treader than to wear a knight's belt. I don't know if you get the hang of what I'm saying.

And when I can swim no longer, if I have not reached Aslan's country, or shot over the edge of the world in some vast cataract, I shall sink with my nose to the sunrise and Peepiceek will be head of the talking mice in Narnia."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，陛下为什么偏要我说呢，”雷佩契普用大多数人都听得见的声音说，“我自己的计划已定。只要我办得到，我就随黎明踏浪者号往东边去。这船不带我去，我就乘我的小筏子划到东边去。小筏子沉了，我就用四只爪子游到东边去。万一我游不动了，游不到阿斯兰的国土，或者万一在世界边缘给什么特大瀑布冲掉了，那我就是沉下水也要鼻子对着日出的地方，那时就让佩比西克当纳尼亚会说话的老鼠首领。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wait," Caspian whispered back. "I've still a card to play."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等一下，”凯斯宾悄声答，“我还有一张牌好打。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hear, hear," said a sailor, "I'll say the same, barring the bit about the coracle, which wouldn't bear me." He added in a lower voice, "I'm not going to be outdone by a mouse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得好，说得好，”一个水手说，“我也会说这番话的，只是小筏子那段话除外，因为我坐不下。”他又低声说了一句，“我可不打算让一只老鼠比下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This isn't going to be much fun," whispered Edmund to Caspian. "What are we to do if half those fellows hang back?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“情况看来不大妙，”爱德蒙悄声对凯斯宾说，“如果那些家伙有一半退缩，那我们怎么办？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this point Caspian jumped to his feet. "Friends," he said, "I think you have not quite understood our purpose. You talk as if we had come to you with our hat in our hand, begging for shipmates. It isn't like that at all. We and our royal brother and sister and their kinsman and Sir Reepicheep, the good knight, and the Lord Drinian have an errand to the world's edge. It is our pleasure to choose from among such of you as are willing those whom we deem worthy of so high an enterprise. We have not said that any can come for the asking. That is why we shall now command the Lord Drinian and Master Rhince to consider carefully what men among you are the hardest in battle, the most skilled seamen, the purest in blood, the most loyal to our person, and the cleanest of life and manners; and to give their names to us in a schedule." He paused and went on in a quicker voice, "Aslan's mane!" he exclaimed. "Do you think that the privilege of seeing the last things is to be bought for a song? Why, every man that comes with us shall bequeath the title of Dawn Treader to all his descendants, and when we land at Cair Paravel on the homeward voyage he shall have either gold or land enough to make him rich all his life. Now -- scatter over the island, all of you. In half an hour's time I shall receive the names that Lord Drinian brings me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这关口，凯斯宾忽然站起来，“朋友们，”他说，“我想你们并不十分理解我们的用意。你们说话的口气好像我们是手里托着帽子来找你们，恳求你们做同船水手似的。根本不是这么回事。我们和我们的王兄王姐，还有他们的亲属，还有好骑士雷佩契普爵士以及德里宁爵爷都奉有到世界边缘的使命。我们很乐意在你们这些自愿参加的人当中，物色我们认为配得上从事如此崇高冒险事业的人选。我们并没有说任何人都能要求参加。所以我们现在指派德里宁船长和赖因斯大副慎重考虑一下，你们当中什么人在战斗中最顽强，什么人是最熟练的海员，什么人血统最纯正，什么人对我们最忠诚，什么人的身世和作风最清白；把这些开张名单给我们。”他顿了一下，又用较快的声音说，“阿斯兰在上！”他大声叫道，“你们以为亲眼看到最后大局的特权是白白到手的吗？当然，每一个跟随我们的人都将把黎明踏浪者号的称号传给子孙后代。一旦我们返航踏上凯尔帕拉维尔，他将分得黄金或土地，足够使他终身享受富贵。现在，你们大家在岛上散开。半小时后我就要德里宁爵爷把名单交到我手里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在要谈到罗普爵爷了。”凯斯宾说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was rather a sheepish silence and then the crew made their bows and moved away, one in this direction and one in that, but mostly in little knots or bunches, talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家听了顿时乖乖默不作声，水手们鞠了躬就走开了，有的朝东，有的往西，不过多半人都三三两两的说着话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But turning to the head of the table he saw that Rhoop was already there. He had arrived, silent and unnoticed, while the discussion was going on, and was seated beside the Lord Argoz. The daughter of Ramandu stood beside him as if she had just helped him into his chair; Ramandu stood behind him and laid both his hands on Rhoop's grey head. Even in daylight a faint silver light came from the hands of the star. There was a smile on Rhoop's haggard face. He held out one of his hands to Lucy and the other to Caspian. For a moment it looked as if he were going to say something. Then his smile brightened as if he were feeling) some delicious sensation, a long sigh of contentment came from his lips, his head fell forward, and he slept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不料他刚朝餐桌首席转过身去，就看见罗普已经坐在那儿了。原来大家在讨论时，他已不声不响，默默无声地来到这里，就坐在阿尔戈兹爵爷身边。拉曼杜的女儿站在他旁边，好像她刚才扶他坐下似的；拉曼杜站在他后面，双手搁在他的白头发上。即使在白天，这个曾是星辰的老人双手还是发出朦胧的银光。罗普憔悴的脸上露出一丝笑容。他伸出一只手给露茜，一只手给凯斯宾。一时间似乎打算说点什么。接着他笑得更欢了，仿佛他体会到一阵美妙的兴奋感，唇边发出一声心满意足的长叹，脑袋往前一冲，就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't let's even think of it," said Eustace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们还是别去想这事吧。”尤斯塔斯说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Caspian's speech, helped perhaps by some magic of the island, was having just the effect he intended. A good many who had been anxious enough to get out of the voyage felt quite differently about being left out of it. And of course whenever any one sailor announced that he had made up his mind to ask for permission to sail, the ones who hadn't said this felt that they were getting fewer and more uncomfortable. So that before the half-hour was nearly over several people were positively "sucking up" to Drinian and Rhince (at least that was what they called it at my school) to get a good report. And soon there were only three left who didn't want to go, and those three were trying very hard to persuade others to stay with them. And very shortly after that there was only one left. And in they end he began to be afraid of being left behind all on his own and changed his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，凯斯宾那番话刚好起到他预期中的作用，也许是岛上什么魔法的帮助吧。刚才还有不少人迫不及待想脱离这次远航，现在对被淘汰的感受竟大不相同了。当然，每逢哪个水手宣称他打定主意要求被批准出海，那些还没说出口的水手就感到他们人数越来越少，心里滋味也越来越不好受。因此，半小时还不到，几个人就积极向德里宁和赖因斯大献殷勤（至少在我学校里，人们是这么个说法），以便获得一个好评价。不久就只剩下三个人千方百计想说服人家跟他们一起留下。不一会儿就只剩下一个人。到末了，他对留下他一个人感到害怕起来，也改变了主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the end of the half-hour they all came trooping back to Aslan's Table and stood at one end while Drinian and Rhince went and sat down with Caspian and made their report; and Caspian accepted all the man but that one who'd had changed his mind at the last moment. His name was Pittencream and he stayed on the Island of the Star all the time the others were away looking for the World's End, and he very much wished he had gone with them. He wasn't the sort of man who could enjoy talking to Ramandu and Ramandu's daughter (nor they to him), and it rained a good deal, and though there was a wonderful feast on the Table every night, he didn't very much enjoy it. He said it gave him the creeps sitting there alone (and in the rain as likely as not) with those four Lords asleep at the end of the Table. And when the others returned he felt so out of things that he deserted on the voyage home at the Lone Islands, and went and lived in Calormen, where he told wonderful stories about his adventures at the End of the World, until at last he came to believe them himself. So you may say, in a sense, that he lived happily ever after. But he could never bear mice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半小时结束，大家全列队回到阿斯兰餐桌前，在一头肃立，德里宁和赖因斯就去跟凯斯宾坐在一起，作了汇报；凯斯宾照单全收，只有那个在最后时刻才改变主意的人没接受。他名叫皮顿克林，大家都出发寻找世界尽头的时候，他就一直待在星岛上，心里巴不得跟他们一起去。他不是那种喜欢跟拉曼杜父女谈天的人，人家也不喜欢跟他谈；而且下了不少场雨，虽然餐桌上夜夜都有美味佳肴，可是他不大爱吃。他说孤零零坐在那儿，陪着睡在餐桌那头的四位爵爷，而且晴雨无阻，真不由得浑身发毛。当其他人回去时，他感到自己处处孤立，返航途中他就在孤独岛开了小差，去住在卡乐门国，他在那里大讲自己在世界尽头的种种奇遇，到最后连自己也信以为真了。所以，在某种意义上来说，他从此日子过得倒也愉快；不过此后他见了老鼠就受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
