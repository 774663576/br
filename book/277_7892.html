<div class="line_en">One day the Giant came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.</div>

<div class="line_en">"My own garden is my own garden," said the Giant; "any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself." So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的花园就是我自己的花园，”巨人说，“谁都清楚，我不准外人来这里玩。”于是，他沿着花园筑起一堵高高的围墙，还挂出一块告示：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them. "How happy we are here!" they cried to each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一个很可爱的大花园，长满了绿茸茸的青草，美丽的鲜花随处可见，多得像天上的星星。草地上还长着十二棵桃树，一到春天就开放出粉扑扑的团团花朵，秋天里则结下累累果实。栖息在树枝上鸟儿唱着欢乐的曲子，每当这时，嬉戏中的孩子们会停下来侧耳玲听鸟儿的鸣唱，并相互高声喊着，“我们多么快乐啊1”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The poor children had now nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. "How happy we were there," they said to each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从此可怜的孩子们没有了玩耍的地方，他们只得来到马路上，但是街道上满是尘土和硬硬的石块，让他们扫兴极了。放学后他们仍常常在高耸的围墙外徘徊，谈论着墙内花园中的美丽景色。“在里面我们多么快乐啊，”他们彼此诉说着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. "Spring has forgotten this garden," they cried, "so we will live here all the year round." The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. "This is a delightful spot," he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." So the Hail came. Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="春天又来了，整个乡村到处开故着小花，处处有小鸟在欢唱。然而只有自私的巨人的花园却依旧是一片寒冬景象。由于看不见孩子们，小鸟便无心唱歌，树儿也忘了开花。有一朵花儿从草中探出头来，看见那块告示后，它对孩子们的遭遇深感同情，于是又把头缩回去，继续睡觉了。只有雪和霜对此乐不可支。“春天已忘记了这座花园，”他们叫喊着，“这样我们可以一年四季住在这儿了。”雪用她那巨大的白色斗篷把草地蓝得严严实实，霜也让所有的树木披上假装，随后他们还逸来北风和他们同住。北风应邀而至，穿—身毛皮大衣，他对着花园呼啸了整整一天，把烟囱管帽也给吹掉了。“这是个令人开心的地方，”他说，“我们还得把冰雹叫来。”于是，冰雹来了。每天三个钟头他不停地敲打着城堡的房顶，房上的石板瓦被砸得七零八落，然后又围着花园一圈接一圈地猛跑起来。他浑身上下灰蒙蒙的，呼出阵阵袭人的寒气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. "I believe the Spring has come at last," said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一日清晨，巨人睁着双眼躺在床上，这时耳边传来阵阵美妙的音乐。音乐悦耳动听，他想一定是国王的乐师路经此地。原来窗外唱歌的不过是一只小红雀，只因巨人好长时间没听到鸟儿在花园中歌唱，此刻感到它妙不可言。这时，巨人头顶上的冰雹已不再狂舞，北风也停止了呼啸，缕缕芳香透过敞开的窗廓扑面而来。“我相信春天终于来到了，”巨人说着，从床上跳起来，朝窗外望去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming," said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; "I hope there will be a change in the weather."</div>

<div class="line_en">But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none. "He is too selfish," she said. So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而春天再也没有出现，夏天也不见踪影。秋天把金色的硕果送给了千家万户的花园，却什么也没给巨人的花园。“他太自私了，”秋天说。就这样，巨人的花园里是终年的寒冬，只有北风、冰雹，还有霜和雪在园中的林间上窜下跳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly. The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it. "Climb up! little boy," said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看见了一幕动人的景象：孩子们爬过墙上的小洞已进了花园，正坐在树枝上，每棵树上都坐着一个孩子。迎来了孩子的树木欣喜若狂，井用鲜花把自己打扮一新，还挥动手臂轻轻抚摸孩子们的头。鸟儿们在树梢翩翩起舞，兴奋地欢唱着，花朵也纷纷从草地里伸出头来露着笑脸。这的确是一幅动人的画面。满园春色中只有一个角落仍笼罩在严冬之中，那是花园中最远的一个角落，一个小男孩正孤零零地站在那儿，因为他个头太小爬不上树，只能围着树转来转去，哭泣着不知所措。那棵可怜的树仍被霜雪裹得严严实实的，北风也对它肆意地咆哮着。“快爬上来呀，小孩子1”树儿说，并尽可能地垂下枝条，可是小孩还是太矮小了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out. "How selfish I have been!" he said; "now I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever." He was really very sorry for what he had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此情此景深深地感化了巨人的心。“我真是太自私了！”他说，“现在我明白为什么春天不肯到我这儿来了。我要把那可怜的孩子抱上树，然后再把围墙都推倒，让我的花园永远成为孩子们的游戏场所。”他真为自己过去的所做所为感到羞愧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him. And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. "It is your garden now, little children," said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巨人轻轻地走下楼，悄悄地打开前门，走到花园里。但是孩子们一看巨人，都吓得逃走了，花园再次回到了冬天里。唯有那个小男孩没有跑，因为他的眼里充满了泪水，没有看见走过来的巨人。巨人悄悄来到小孩的身后，双手轻轻托起孩子放在树枝上。树儿立即怒放出朵朵鲜花，鸟儿们也飞回枝头放声欢唱，小男孩伸出双臂搂着巨人的脖子，亲吻巨人的脸。其他孩子看见巨人不再那么凶恶，都纷纷跑了回来，春天也跟着孩子们来了。“孩子们，这是你们的花园了，”巨人说。接着他提起一把大斧头，把围墙统统给砍倒了。中午12点，人们去赶集的时候，欣喜地看见巨人和孩子们一起在他们所见到的最美丽的花园中游戏玩耍。">查看中文翻译</div>
