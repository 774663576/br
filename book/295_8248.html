<div class="line_en">In the bathroom, she slipped out of her pajamas and started a shower. Stepping into the stall, she thought about how easy it had been to get here. A little less than forty-eight hours ago she had been sitting with Deanna, studying the letters, making phone calls, and searching for Garrett. Once she got home, she had spoken to Ella, who again agreed to watch Harvey and pick up her mail.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day she went to the library and read up on scuba diving. It seemed like the logical thing to do. Her years as a reporter had taught her to take nothing for granted, to make a plan, and to do her best to prepare for anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天她去了图书馆，阅读了有关带肺潜水的资料。就好像这是顺理成章的事情。她做记者的多年经验告诉她对任何事情都不能自以为是，制定计划，尽力对任何事情做好准备是必要的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The plan she finally came up with was simple. She would go to Island Diving and browse around the store, with the hope of getting a look at Garrett Blake. If he turned out to be a seventy-year-old man or a twenty-year-old student, she would simply turn around and go home. But if their instincts were right and he seemed to be approximately her age, she decided she would try to speak with him. That was why she had taken the time to learn something about scuba diving-she wanted to sound as if she knew something about it. And she would probably be able to learn more about him if she could talk to him about something he was interested in, without having to tell him too much about herself. Then she'd have a better grasp on things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她最后想出的计划其实很简单。她将去海岛潜水店，到店里随便看看，希望能先看盖瑞特·布莱克一眼。如果发现他是七十岁的老头子或二十岁的学生，她只需转身打道回府即可。但是如果她们的直觉是正确的，他和她年龄相仿，她便决定和他攀谈。这就是为什么她不辞辛苦地去学习带肺潜水的原因——她想让自己听上去对此略知一二。如果她能跟他谈谈他喜欢的事情而不要对自己讲太多，她便能对他有更深的了解。这样她便能更好地掌控形势。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但是她千里迢迢跑到这里来不可能现在就放弃，尽管事实上她不知道要说什么。但就如迪安娜所言，如果没有好结果，她只需重返波士顿就好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But after that? That was the part she wasn't exactly sure about. She didn't want to tell Garrett the complete truth about why she came-that would sound crazy. Hi, I read your letters to Catherine, and knowing how much you loved her, I just thought you might be the man I've been looking for. No, that was out of the question, and the other option didn't seem much better-Hi, I'm from the Boston Times and I found your letters. Could we do a story on you? That didn't seem right, either. Nor did any of the other ideas that filtered through her mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那之后呢？这部分是她不完全确信的。她不想把她到这里来的真相告诉盖瑞特——那太疯狂。嗨，我读过你写给凯瑟琳的信，知道你爱她有多深，我只是想：你也许就是那个我苦苦追寻的男人。不，这肯定不行，而其他说辞似乎也好不到哪里去——嗨，我是从《波士顿时报》来的专栏作家，我发现了你写的信。我们能就你的故事写篇报道吗？这似乎也不对。她头脑中闪过的其他想法也行不通。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stepped out of the shower, dried off before putting some lotion on her arms and legs, and dressed in a short-sleeved white blouse, denim shorts, and a pair of white sandals. She wanted to look casual, and she did. What she didn't want was to be noticed right off the bat. After all, she didn't know what to expect, and she wanted the opportunity to evaluate the situation on her own terms, without having to deal with anyone else.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her first stop was at a convenience store, where she bought a map of Wilmington. The clerk had also given her directions, and she found her way easily, despite the fact that Wilmington was larger than she had imagined. The streets were packed with cars, especially as she passed by the bridges that led to the islands right off the coast. Kure Beach, Carolina Beach, and Wrightsville Beach were reached by bridges that crossed from the city, and that was where most of the traffic seemed to be headed.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she was finally ready to leave, she found the phone book, thumbed through it, and scribbled the address of Island Diving on a piece of paper. Two deep breaths later, she was walking down the hall. Again she repeated Deanna's mantra.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她最终做好准备要出发时，她找到了电话簿，翻看后将海岛潜水的地址潦草地写在了一张纸上。深吸两口气后，她穿过大厅。再次默默在心中重复迪安娜的观点，暗自为自己打气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In it, he was adjusting the straps that held the tank to one of the student's back, and she could tell from the photo that Deanna and she had been right about him. He looked to be in his thirties, with a lean face and short brown hair that seemed to have bleached a little from hours spent in the sun. He was taller than the student by a couple of inches, and the sleeveless shirt he was wearing showed well-defined muscles in his arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在照片中，他正在调整一个学员背着的潜水气瓶上的带子，她能从照片中看出自己和迪安娜对他的猜测没错。他看起来三十多岁，瘦脸，棕色的短发，皮肤看起来像是因为长时间在太阳底下暴晒而有些白亮。他比旁边的学员高几英寸，穿的无袖衬衣使他的手臂上的肌肉清晰可辨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first article, reprinted from the newspaper, was about scuba diving, and the caption beneath the photo read simply "Garrett Blake of Island Diving, readying his class for its first ocean dive."</div>

<div class="line_en">Because the picture was a little grainy, she couldn't make out the color of his eyes, though she could tell that his face was weathered as well. She thought she saw wrinkles around the corners of his eyes, though that could have been caused by squinting in the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为图片有纹路，因此她不能分辨出他眼睛的颜色，但是她能看出他的脸饱经风霜。她想他的眼角有细纹，也许那是在太阳下习惯性眯眼造成的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She read the article carefully, noting when he generally taught his classes and some facts about getting certification. The second article had no picture but talked about shipwreck diving, which was popular in North Carolina. North Carolina, it seemed, had more than five hundred wrecks charted off the coast and was called the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Because of the Outer Banks and other islands directly off the coast, ships had run aground for centuries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她仔细阅读这篇文章，格外留意他通常什么时候授课，以及如何获得证书的一些细节。第二篇文章里没有照片，但是谈到了船难时的潜水，这在北卡罗来纳州很流行，看航海图上的标记，似乎在该海岸发生过超过五百起船难事故，因此这个地方被称为“大西洋墓地”。因为北卡罗来纳州的外滩和海岸附近的岛屿众多，因此，几个世纪以来船只搁浅事故时有发生。">查看中文翻译</div>

En route to South Carolina, it had sunk off Cape Hatteras in 1862 while being towed by a steamer. The wreck had finally been discovered, and Garrett Blake, along with other divers from Duke Marine Institute, had been asked to dive to the ocean floor to explore the possibility of raising it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三篇文章里同样没有照片，讲述的是“监视器”——内战期间的第一艘联邦装甲舰。它在1862年途经北卡罗来纳州时，在被汽轮拖拉前进的过程中，沉入了哈特拉斯角。船的残骸最终被发现了，盖瑞特·布莱克和来自杜克大学海洋实验室的其他潜水员曾接到邀请，潜入海底去探索将它拉上来的可能性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fourth article was about Happenstance. Eight pictures of the boat had been taken from various angles, inside and out, all detailing the restoration. The boat, she learned, was fairly unique in that it was made entirely of wood and had first been manufactured in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1927. Designed by Herreshoff, one of the most noted maritime engineers of that period, it had a long and adventurous history (including being used in the Second World War to study the German garrisons that lined the shores of France). Eventually the boat made its way to Nantucket, where it was bought by a local businessman. By the time Garrett Blake purchased it four years ago, it had fallen into disrepair, and the article said that he and his wife, Catherine, had restored it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第四篇文章是关于“意外号”的，文中有八张照片，分别从不同角度以及船内外给船拍摄的，讲的全是重修细节。从文章中她得知这艘船非比寻常，因为它的用料全部采用木材，1927年始建于葡萄牙首都里斯本，由赫雷斯霍夫——当时最富盛名的海航工程师之一设计的，它有一段漫长的探险历史（包括在二战中用来研究驻守在法国海岸的德国守备部队）。最终这艘船驶向了楠塔基特岛，在那里，它被当地的一个商人买下了。四年前，盖瑞特·布莱克就是从他手里买下了它的，船当时破败不堪，据文章报道，他和他的妻子凯瑟琳重新修好了它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although she felt nervous as she started down the ramp, the articles in the shop had given her a couple of ideas of what to talk about. Once she met him, she would simply explain that after reading the article about Happenstance, she wanted to see the boat up close. It would sound believable, and hopefully she could parlay that into a longer conversation. Then, of course, she'd have some idea of what he was like in person. And after that... well, then she'd see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管她朝斜坡路往下走时很紧张，但商店里的文章激发了她的灵感，她想到了几个攀谈的话题。一旦她遇上他，她只需解释说她在他商店里读了那篇关于“意外号”的文章后，想近距离看看这艘船。这听上去可信，但愿她能成功利用这个话题将它演变成一段更长的对话。然后，当然，她已经知道了他本人长什么模样。然后……好吧，到时候她再看着办。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she approached the boat, however, the first thing she noticed was that no one seemed to be around. There wasn't anyone on board, there wasn't anyone on the docks, and it appeared as if no one had been there all morning. The boat was locked down, the sail covered, and nothing seemed out of place. After looking around for any sign of him, she checked the name on the back of the boat. It was indeed Happenstance. She brushed aside some hair that had blown onto her face as she puzzled over it. Odd, she thought, the man at the store had said he was here.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of returning to the shop right away, she took a moment to admire the boat. It was beautiful-rich and textured, unlike the boats that surrounded it. It had much more character than the other sailboats docked on either side of it, and she knew why the paper had done an article on it. In a way, it reminded her of a much smaller version of pirate ships she had seen in the movies. She paced back and forth for a few minutes, studying it from different angles, and wondered how run-down it had been prior to the restoration. Most of it looked new, though she assumed that they hadn't replaced all the wood. They had probably sanded her down, and as she looked closer, she saw nicks in the hull, lending credence to her theory.</div>
