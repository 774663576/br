<div class="line_en">I'd spent the spring in London, and all in all, even if I hadn't achieved everything I'd set out to, it had been an exciting interlude. But with the weeks slipping by and summer getting closer, the old restlessness had started to return. For one thing, I was getting vaguely paranoid about running into any more of my former university friends. Wandering around Camden Town, or going through CDs I couldn't afford in West End megastores, I'd already had too many of them come up to me, asking how I was getting on since leaving the course to "seek fame and fortune." It's not that I was embarrassed to tell them what I'd been up to. It was just that -- with a very few exceptions -- none of them was capable of grasping what was or wasn't, for me at this particular point, a "successful" few months.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I've said, I hadn't achieved every goal I'd set my sights on, but then those goals had always been more like long-term targets. And all those auditions, even the really dreary ones, had been an invaluable experience. In almost every case, I'd taken something away with me, something I'd learned about the scene in London, or else about the music business in general.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of these auditions had been pretty professional affairs. You'd find yourself in a warehouse, or a converted garage block, and there'd be a manager, or maybe the girlfriend of a band member, taking your name, asking you to wait, offering you tea, while the sounds of the band, stopping and starting, thundered out from the adjoining space. But the majority of auditions happened at a much more shambolic level. In fact, when you saw the way most bands went about things, it was no mystery why the whole scene in London was dying on its feet. Time and again, I'd walk past rows of anonymous suburban terraces on the city outskirts, carry my acoustic guitar up a staircase, and enter a stale-smelling flat with mattresses and sleeping bags all over the floor, and band members who mumbled and barely looked you in the eye. I'd sing and play while they stared emptily at me, till one of them might bring it to an end by saying something like: "Yeah, well. Thanks anyway, but it's not quite our genre."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有的试音挺正式的。你到一个仓库或改装的车库里去，有经理或者乐队成员的女朋友记下你的名字，端茶给你，叫你等一会儿，这时隔壁传来很大声的、乐队时断时续的演奏。但是大部分试音则很随便。事实上，看了大多数乐队行为处事的方式之后，你就会明白为什么伦敦乐坛每况愈下。我一次次穿梭于伦敦郊区不知名的街道间，带着我的原声吉他走上楼梯，走进散发着霉味的公寓。屋子里的地板上垫子和睡袋扔得到处都是。乐队的人嘴里一直嘀咕着，几乎不看你的眼睛。我弹唱的时候他们只是两眼空洞地看着你，直到其中一个人叫我停下来，说：“噢，可以了。谢谢你来试音，但这跟我们的风格不太一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I soon worked out that most of these guys were shy or plain awkward about the audition process, and that if I chatted to them about other things, they'd become a lot more relaxed. That's when I'd pick up all kinds of useful info: where the interesting clubs were, or the names of other bands in need of a guitarist. Or sometimes it was just a tip about a new act to check out. As I say, I never came away empty-handed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很快就发现这些人其实很多都很害羞，对试音这事儿很不自在。若我和他们聊些别的，他们就放松多了。我就是这样收集到各种有用的信息的：哪儿有有意思的夜总会，哪个乐队需要吉他手。或者只是推荐你听听哪里的乐队。我说了，我从来不会空手而归。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Much harder to accept was the other main obstacle -- and I have to say, I was completely surprised by this one. There was actually a problem about me writing my own songs. I couldn't believe it. There I'd be, in some dingy apartment, playing to a circle of blank faces, then at the end, after a silence that could go on for fifteen, thirty seconds, one of them would ask suspiciously: "So whose number was that?" And when I said it was one of my own, you'd see the shutters coming down. There'd be little shrugs, shakes of the head, sly smiles exchanged, then they'd be giving me their rejection patter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一主要障碍才让人难以接受——而且我得说，这一点是我完全没有预料到的。我自己写歌竟然成了问题。真不敢相信。我在某个乱糟糟的公寓里，对着一群面无表情的脸孔演奏，弹完了以后，经过十五、甚至三十秒钟的停顿，会有一个人疑惑地问道：“这是谁的歌？”我说是我自己的歌，刷的一声，窗子关上了。耸肩的耸肩，摇头的摇头，还诡异地互相笑一笑，然后送上他们打发人的那套说辞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the whole, people really liked my guitar-playing, and a lot of them said my vocals would come in handy for harmonies. But it quickly emerged there were two factors going against me. The first was that I didn't have equipment. A lot of bands were wanting someone with electric guitar, amps, speakers, preferably transport, ready to slot right into their gigging schedule. I was on foot with a fairly crappy acoustic. So no matter how much they liked my rhythm work or my voice, they'd no choice but to turn me away. This was fair enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基本上大家都觉得我吉他弹得不错，很多人还说我的声音很适合和声。但我很快就发现有两个因素对我不利。一是我没有装备。很多乐队都希望找到一个自带电吉他、扩音器、喇叭，最好还有交通工具的人，能够马上开始和他们一起表演。我只有两条腿和一把破破烂烂的原声吉他。所以不管他们多喜欢我的演奏或声音，都不得不叫我走人。公平得很。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The stupidity of this position, which seemed to extend right across the London scene, was key to persuading me there was something if not utterly rotten, then at least extremely shallow and inauthentic about what was going down here, right at the grass-roots level, and that this was undoubtedly a reflection of what was happening in the music industry all the way up the ladder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="似乎整个伦敦乐坛都是这种傻瓜论调。正是这一点使我相信：在这里，就在最根部，有一种就算不是完全腐烂，但至少也是极其肤浅、极其虚伪的东西在蔓延；这种现象无疑直达最上层，反映了整个音乐界的现状。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The umpteenth time this happened, I got so exasperated, I said: "Look, I don't get this. Are you wanting to be a covers band for ever? And even if that's what you want to be, where do you think those songs come from in the first place? Yeah, that's right. Someone writes them!"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was this realisation, and the fact that as the summer came closer I was running out of floors to sleep on, that made me feel for all the fascination of London -- my university days looked grey by comparison -- it would be good to take a break from the city. So I called up my sister, Maggie, who runs a cafe with her husband up in the Malvern Hills, and that's how it came to be decided I'd spend the summer with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一发现，加上夏天临近，使得我再没有地方可以寄居，我决定：虽然伦敦魅力四射——我的大学生活跟它一比，真是暗淡无光——我还是离开一阵子的好。于是我打电话给家姐玛吉。她和丈夫在莫尔文山经营一家小餐厅。就这样，我决定这个夏天和他们一起住。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maggie said she and Geoff couldn't afford to pay me, which suited me just fine because it meant I couldn't be expected to work too hard for them. All the same, since I was getting bed and board, the understanding seemed to be that I'd be a third member of staff. It was all a bit unclear, and at the start, Geoff, in particular, seemed torn between giving me a kick up the arse for not doing enough, and apologising for asking me to do anything at all, like I was a guest. But things soon settled down to a pattern. The work was easy enough -- I was especially good at making sandwiches -- and I sometimes had to keep reminding myself of my main objective in coming out to the country in the first place: that's to say, I was going to write a brand-new batch of songs ready for my return to London in the autumn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛吉说她和杰夫没钱付我工资，这正合我意，因为这样我就不用做得很辛苦。但是既然我在这里吃、在这里住，大家自然把我当作第三名店员。一开始的时候事情有点乱，特别是杰夫，有时很想揍我一顿，因为我干得太少，有时又不好意思叫我做事情，好像我是客人。但情况很快就步入了正轨。工作很简单——我特别会做三明治——但我得时不时提醒自己不要忘了最初决定来乡下的主要目的，是为了写一批新歌，秋天回伦敦的时候用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maggie's four years older and is always worrying about me, so I knew she'd be all for my coming up. In fact, I could tell she was glad to be getting the extra help. When I say her cafe is in the Malvern Hills, I don't mean it's in Great Malvern or down on the A road, but literally up there in the hills. It's an old Victorian house standing by itself facing the west side, so when the weather's nice, you can have your tea and cake out on the cafe terrace with a sweeping view over Herefordshire. Maggie and Geoff have to close the place in the winter, but in the summer it's always busy, mainly with the locals -- who park their cars in the West of England car park a hundred yards below and come panting up the path in sandals and floral dresses -- or else the walking brigade with their maps and serious gear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛吉比我大四岁，而且老是为我担心，所以我知道她一定赞成我到她那里去。其实，我还知道她很高兴有人帮她。我说她在莫尔文山开小餐厅，并不是指在大莫尔文镇或一级公路上，而是确确实实在山上。餐厅是一栋维多利亚时期的老房子，面朝西独自屹立在山上，因此天气晴朗时，可以把茶和蛋糕拿到店外的露台上去，俯瞰整个赫里福郡的景色。冬天的时候只得关门大吉，但夏天则总是忙得不可开交。客人主要是本地人——他们把车停在山下一百米的“西英格兰”停车场，穿着凉鞋和花花绿绿的衣服，气喘吁吁地沿着小路爬上来——有时也有手拿地图、穿戴整齐、徒步登山的游客。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wasn't a stranger to this area. Maggie and I had grown up only a few miles away in Pershore and our parents had often brought us for walks on the hills. But I'd never been much up for it in those days, and as soon as I was old enough, I'd refused to go with them. That summer though, I felt this was the most beautiful place in the world; that in many ways I'd come from and belonged to the hills. Maybe it was something to do with our parents having split up, the fact that for some time now, that little grey house opposite the hairdresser was no longer "our" house. Whatever it was, this time round, instead of the claustrophobia I remembered from my childhood, I felt affection, even nostalgia, about the area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对这个地方并不陌生。玛吉和我就在离这里只有几英里的珀肖尔长大，父母经常带我们到山上来散步。可是那时候我不喜欢这里，等我长大一点，我就不跟他们一起来了。但是那年夏天，我感到这里是世界上最美的地方；感到从许多方面说来，我来自并且属于这片山丘。这种感觉也许跟我们的父母已经离异有关，多年来，理发店对面的那间灰色小屋不再是“我们的”家了。不管是什么原因，现在我对这里的感觉不再是童年印象中的幽闭、可怕，而是亲切，甚至是怀念。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm naturally an early riser, but I quickly discovered that breakfast at the cafe was a nightmare, with customers wanting eggs done this way, toast like that, everything getting overcooked. So I made a point of never appearing until around eleven. While all the clatter was going on downstairs, I'd open the big bay window in my room, sit on the broad window sill and play my guitar looking out over miles and miles of countryside. There was a run of really clear mornings just after I arrived, and it was a glorious feeling, like I could see forever, and when I strummed my chords, they were ringing out across the whole nation. Only when I turned and stuck my head right out of the window would I get an aerial view of the cafe terrace below, and become aware of the people coming and going with their dogs and pushchairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我天生就是个早起的人，但是我很快就发现店里的早餐时间真是噩梦：客人要的蛋要做成这样、面包要烤成那样，东西常常煮过头。于是我决定十一点之前不出现。当楼下吵吵嚷嚷的时候，我打开房里的凸窗，坐在宽大的窗台上，面向绵延数英里的山丘弹奏吉他。我刚来的时候，一连几个早上都是大晴天，感觉好极了，景色一望无际。我随意拨弄琴弦，琴声好像能传遍整个英国。只有当我把脑袋伸出窗外，才会看见底下餐厅的露台，看见人们牵着狗、推着婴儿车进进出出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I found myself wandering in the hills practically every day, sometimes with my guitar if I was sure it wouldn't rain. I liked in particular Table Hill and End Hill, at the north end of the range, which tend to get neglected by day-trippers. There I'd sometimes be lost in my thoughts for hours at a time without seeing a soul. It was like I was discovering the hills for the first time, and I could almost taste the ideas for new songs welling up in my mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我几乎每天都到山上去走一走，要是确定不会下雨的话，还会把吉他带上。我特别喜欢位于山脉北端的桌山和尾山，当天来、当天回的人一般不会到这里来。有时候，我在这里坐上好几个小时，独自思考，一个人影也见不到。感觉就好像我是第一次发现这里，有无数的新旋律在我脑子里冒出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Working at the cafe, though, was another matter. I'd catch a voice, or see a face coming up to the counter while I was preparing a salad, that would jerk me back to an earlier part of my life. Old friends of my parents would come up and grill me about what I was up to, and I'd have to bluff until they decided to leave me in peace. Usually they'd sign off with something like: "Well at least you're keeping busy," nodding towards the sliced bread and tomatoes, before waddling back to their table with their cup and saucer. Or someone I'd known at school would come in and start talking to me in their new "university" voice, maybe dissecting the latest Batman film in clever-clever language, or else starting on about the real causes of world poverty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而在店里帮忙就是另一回事了。做三明治的时候，总有一个熟悉的声音或面孔，朝柜台这边过来，把我猛地拉回到过去。父母的老朋友会过来盘问我的近况，我只好瞎扯一通，直到他们不再烦我。离开之前他们常常会一边看我切面包、切西红柿，一边点点头，说“啊，至少你现在有事可做”之类的话，才拿着杯子、碟子蹒跚地回到座位上去。有时是遇见我的老同学，操着一副新学来的“大学”腔跟我搭话，对最新的蝙蝠侠电影评头论足一番，或者侃侃而谈世界贫困的根本原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was Mrs. Fraser -- or Hag Fraser, as we used to call her. I recognised her as soon as she came in with a muddy little bulldog. I felt like telling her she couldn't bring the dog inside, though people always did that when they came to get things. Hag Fraser had been one of my teachers at school in Pershore. Thankfully she retired before I went into the sixth form, but in my memory her shadow falls over my entire school career. Her aside, school hadn't been that bad, but she'd had it in for me from the start, and when you're just eleven years old, there's nothing you can do to defend yourself from someone like her. Her tricks were the usual ones twisted teachers have, like asking me in lessons exactly the questions she sensed I wouldn't be able to answer, then making me stand up and getting the class to laugh at me. Later, it got more subtle. I remember once, when I was fourteen, a new teacher, a Mr. Travis, had exchanged jokes with me in class. Not jokes against me, but like we were equals, and the class had laughed, and I'd felt good about it. But a couple of days later, I was going down the corridor and Mr. Travis was coming the other way, talking with her, and as I came by she stopped me and gave me a complete bollocking about late homework or something. The point is she'd done this just to let Mr. Travis know I was a "troublemaker;" that if he'd thought for one moment I was one of the boys worthy of his respect, he was making a big mistake. Maybe it was because she was old, I don't know, but the other teachers never seemed to see through her. They all took whatever she said as gospel.</div>

<div class="line_en">This all cheered me up no end. I forgot about Hag Fraser soon after that, because a group came in and I had to make a lot of tuna salads. But a few days later when I was chatting to Geoff in the kitchen, I got a few more details from him; like how her husband of forty-odd years had gone off with his secretary; and how their hotel had got off to a reasonable start, but now all the gossip was of guests demanding their money back, or checking out within hours of arrival.

<div class="line_en">Geoff had gone into Great Malvern that day, so it was just me and Maggie holding the fort. The main lunch rush was over, but at the point when the Krauts came in, we still had plenty going on. I'd clocked them in my mind as "the Krauts" the moment I heard their accents. I wasn't being racist. If you have to stand behind a counter and remember who didn't want beetroot, who wanted extra bread, who gets what put on which bill, you've no choice but to turn all the customers into characters, give them names, pick out physical peculiarities. Donkey Face had a ploughman's and two coffees. Tuna mayo baguettes for Winston Churchill and his wife. That's how I was doing it. So Tilo and Sonja were "the Krauts."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very hot that afternoon, but most of the customers -- being English -- still wanted to sit outside on the terrace, some of them even avoiding the parasols so they could go bright red in the sun. But the Krauts decided to sit indoors in the shade. They had on loose, camel-coloured trousers, trainers and T-shirts, but somehow looked smart, the way people from the continent often do. I supposed they were in their forties, maybe early fifties -- I didn't pay too much attention at that stage. They ate their lunch talking quietly to each other, and they seemed like any pleasant, middle-aged couple from Europe. Then after a while, the guy got up and started wandering about the room, pausing to study an old faded photo Maggie has on the wall, of the house as it was in 1915. Then he stretched out his arms and said:</div>

<div class="line_en">Maggie chatted with him for a few minutes about places they'd already visited in England, what they should see in the local area, the usual stuff you were supposed to say to tourists. I'd heard it loads of times before, and I could do it myself more or less on automatic, so I started to tune out. I just took in that the Krauts were actually Swiss and that they were travelling around by hired car. He kept saying what a great place England was and how kind everyone had been, and made big laughing noises whenever Maggie said anything halfway jokey. But as I say, I'd tuned out, thinking they were just this fairly boring couple. I only started paying attention again a few moments later, when I noticed the way the guy kept trying to bring his wife into the conversation, and how she kept silent, her eyes fixed on her guidebook and behaving like she wasn't aware of any conversation at all.

On the other hand it wasn't completely isolated, and every now and then, a walker would pass by, saying "Hi!" in the way they do, maybe adding some quip about my guitar, all without breaking stride.

<div class="line_en">As I got ready to play, they shifted again, so they were facing the view like before, their backs to me. But this time, instead of cuddling, they sat there on the grass with surprisingly upright postures, each with a hand up to the brow to shield away the sun. They stayed like that all the time I played, peculiarly still, and what with the way each of them cast a long afternoon shadow, they looked like matching art exhibits. I brought my incomplete song to a meandering halt, and for a moment they didn't move. Then their postures relaxed, and they applauded, though perhaps not quite as enthusiastically as the last time. Tilo got to his feet, muttering compliments, then helped Sonja up. It was only when you saw how they did this that you remembered they were really quite middle-aged. Maybe they were just tired. For all I know, they might have done a fair bit of walking before they'd come across me. All the same, it seemed to me they found it quite a struggle to get up.</div>

But when Geoff made the same point over supper -- which we ate in the cafe from various left-overs -- he put it like it was a negative thing, like it was awful they'd been made to work so hard and where had I been to help? Maggie asked how my afternoon had gone, and I didn't mention Tilo and Sonja -- that seemed too complicated -- but told her I'd gone up to the Sugarloaf to work on my song. And when she asked if I'd made any progress, and I said yes, I was making real headway now, Geoff got up and marched out moodily, even though there was still food on his plate. Maggie pretended not to notice, and fair enough, he came back a few minutes later with a can of beer, and sat there reading his newspaper and not saying much. I didn't want to be the cause of a rift between my sister and brother-in-law, so I excused myself soon after that and went upstairs to work some more on the song.</div>

Of course everything was in darkness, but outside down on the terrace there was a security light, so I could just about make out her face.

For a start, the curtains didn't pull all the way across, which meant if I opened a window in the stifling heat, insects from miles around would see my light and come charging in. And the light I had was just this one bare bulb hanging down from the ceiling rose, which cast gloomy shadows all round the room, making it look all the more obviously the spare room it was. That evening, I was wanting light to work by, to jot down lyrics as they occurred to me. But it got far too stuffy, and in the end I switched off the bulb, pulled back the curtains, and opened the windows wide. Then I sat in the bay with my guitar, just the way I did in the day.</div>

Even so, it was my sister I was livid at. In all the time I'd been in her house, she hadn't once asked to hear a song, the way Tilo and Sonja had done. Surely it wasn't too much to ask of your own sister, and one who'd been, I happened to remember, a big music fan in her teens?

I made some toast and coffee, helped myself to some left-over scrambled eggs, and settled down in the corner of the cafe. All through my breakfast the thought kept occurring to me I might run into Tilo and Sonja again up in the hills. And though this might mean having to face the music about Hag Fraser's place, even so, I realised I was hoping it would happen.

And my sister didn't understand what I was trying to achieve any better than did her moron of a husband. It would serve them both right if I left them here in the lurch and went back to London.

Let's go for a walk, he says. You will feel better then. So we come out here. And he says, Sonja, look at these hills, aren't they so beautiful? Aren't we fortunate to come to such a place as this for our vacation? These hills, he says, are even more wonderful than he imagined them when we listen to Elgar. He asks me, isn't this so? Perhaps I become angry again. I tell him, these hills are not so wonderful. It is not how I imagine them when I hear Elgar's music. Elgar's hills are majestic and mysterious. Here, this is just like a park. This is what I say to him, and then it is his turn to be cross. He says in that case, he will walk by himself. He says we are finished, we never agree on anything now. Yes, he says, Sonja, you and me, we are finished. And off he goes! So there you are. That is why he is up there and I am down here." She shielded her eyes again and watched Tilo's progress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她像是想了想我的话，才点点头，说：“没错，我注意到了旅馆的毛病。可蒂洛没有。他当然是觉得旅馆很好。他老说我们运气很好。很幸运能找到一家那样的旅馆。然后，今天早上吃早饭的时候，蒂洛说早饭真不错，是他吃过的最好的早餐。我说蒂洛，别傻了，这早饭不怎么样，这旅馆也不怎么样。他说不，不，我们很幸运。我生气了，向女主人投诉所有的问题。蒂洛把我拉开，说，我们去散步吧。走一走你就会感觉好些了。于是我们就到这儿来了。他说，索尼娅，看看这些山，不漂亮吗？我们能到这种地方来度假不是很幸运吗？他说，这些山比他听埃尔加的时候想象的还要美丽。他问我，不是吗？我可能是又生气了，说，这些山不怎么样，不是我听埃尔加的时候想象的那个样子。埃尔加的山雄伟、神秘，这儿只不过像个公园。我这么跟他说的，这回轮到他生气了。他说既然这样，他要自个儿去散步。他说我们完了，如今我们什么都说不到一块儿去了。他说，没有错，索尼娅，你和我，我们完了。说完他就走了！事情就是这样。这就是为什么他在那里，我在这里。”说完她又把手罩在眼睛上，追随着蒂洛的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The reason you've quarrelled, the reason your holiday's all messed up now. It's my fault. It's that hotel, isn't it? It wasn't very good, right?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们又不说话了。过了一会儿，我叹了口气，说道：“我想都是因为我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Please. The hotel is not important." She leaned forward to get a better view of Tilo. Then she turned to me and smiled, and I thought maybe there were little tears in her eyes. "Tell me," she said. "Today, you mean to write more songs?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别这么说。旅馆不重要。”她往前探了探身子，好把蒂洛看得清楚些。然后转过来对我微微一笑，我想她的眼睛里噙着些许泪水。她说：“说说你今天是不是打算再写几首歌？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I would like to say the same. Because you are young and talented. But I am not so certain. As it is, life will bring enough disappointments.

If disappointments do come, you will carry on still. You will say, just as he does, I am so lucky." For a few seconds, she went on gazing at me, like she was memorising the way I looked. The breeze was blowing her hair about, making her seem older than she usually did. "I wish you much luck," she said finally.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took the guitar from its case and sat back on the bench. I didn't play anything for a while though, because I was looking into the distance, towards Worcestershire Beacon, and Tilo's tiny figure up on the incline. Maybe it was to do with the way the sun was hitting that part of the hill, but I could see him much more clearly now than before, even though he'd got further away. He'd paused for a moment on the path, and seemed to be looking about him at the surrounding hills, almost like he was trying to reappraise them. Then his figure started to move again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从盒子里拿出吉他，坐回到长椅上，并没有马上弹起来，而是看着远方，看着伍斯特郡的比肯山和斜坡上蒂洛细小的身影。也许是太阳照射在山上的角度的问题，现在蒂洛的身影比刚才清楚多了，虽然他离得更远了。他在小路上驻足了片刻，似乎在环顾四周的山峰，就好像是想重新评价它们。然后他的身影又开始移动。">查看中文翻译</div>
