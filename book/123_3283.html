<div class="line_en">The family, on top of the load, the children and Connie and Rose of Sharon and the preacher were stiff and cramped. They had sat in the heat in front of the coroner's office in Bakersfield while Pa and Ma and Uncle John went in. Then a basket was brought out and the long bundle lifted down from the truck. And they sat in the sun while the examination went on, while the cause of death was found and the certificate signed.</div>

<div class="line_en">And at last Pa and Ma and Uncle John came out, and they were subdued and quiet. Uncle John climbed up on the load. Pa and Ma got in the seat. Tom and Al strolled back and Tom got under the steering wheel. He sat there silently, waiting for some instruction. Pa looked straight ahead, his dark hat pulled low. Ma rubbed the sides of her mouth with her fingers, and her eyes were far away and lost, dead with weariness.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no order in the camp; little gray tents, shacks, cars were scattered about at random. The first house was nondescript. The south wall was made of three sheets of rusty corrugated iron, the east wall a square of moldy carpet tacked between two boards, the north wall a strip of roofing paper and a strip of tattered canvas, and the west wall six pieces of gunny sacking. Over the square frame, on untrimmed willow limbs, grass had been piled, not thatched, but heaped up in a low mound. The entrance, on the gunny-sack side, was cluttered with equipment. A five-gallon kerosene can served for a stove. It was laid on its side, with a section of rusty stovepipe thrust in one end. A wash boiler rested on its side against the wall; and a collection of boxes lay about, boxes to sit on, to eat on. A Model T Ford sedan and a two-wheel trailer were parked beside the shack, and about the camp there hung a slovenly despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那地方一点秩序也没有；横七竖八地散搭着一些灰色的小帐篷和棚舍，还有一些汽车。第一家就是怪模怪样的。南墙是三张发锈的波状铁皮钉成的，东墙是一块破毛毯夹在两块木板中间；北墙是一张盖屋顶的硬纸板和一条破帆布；西墙则是六只麻布袋缀成的。方形的屋架上有一些没有修剪的柳枝，上面厚厚地堆着茅草，这就算是屋顶了。麻布袋那一边的进口处堆着一些用具。一只五加仑装的煤油箱当火炉使用。油箱是横放着的，有一头装着一节发锈的烟筒。一只锅子靠墙放在火炉旁边，地下摆着许多木箱，有的当椅子坐，有的当吃饭的桌子用。一辆T型的福特轿车和一辆双轮的拖车停在棚舍旁边。这个临时住处有一副邋遢不堪的凄凉景象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom started the car and they rolled through the streets and out toward the country. And by a bridge they saw a collection of tents and shacks. Tom said, "Might's well stop here. Find out what's doin', an' where at the work is." He drove down a steep dirt incline and parked on the edge of the encampment.</div>

<div class="line_en">And next there was a huge tent, ragged, torn in strips and the tears mended with pieces of wire. The flaps were up, and inside four wide mattresses lay on the ground. A clothes line strung along the side bore pink cotton dresses and several pairs of overalls. There were forty tents and shacks, and beside each habitation some kind of automobile. Far down the line a few children stood and stared at the newly arrived truck, and they moved toward it, little boys in overalls and bare feet, their hair gray with dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再过去是一个破破烂烂的大帐篷，破洞都用铁丝修补过。门帷是卷起来的，里面有四张宽大的床垫铺在地上。靠边拉了一条晾衣服的绳子，搭着几件粉红色的布衣服，还有几条工装裤。一共有四十个帐篷和棚舍，每家旁边都停着某一种汽车。那排帐篷的尽头站着几个孩子，眼瞪瞪地看着新到的卡车，向车子走过来，这些小男孩都穿着工装裤，赤着脚，头发布满了灰尘，变成了灰白色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next to the shack there was a little tent, gray with weathering, but neatly, properly set up; and the boxes in front of it were placed against the tent wall. A stovepipe stuck out of the door flap, and the dirt in front of the tent had been swept and sprinkled. A bucketful of soaking clothes stood on a box. The camp was neat and sturdy. A Model A roadster and a little home-made bed trailer stood beside the tent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="棚舍隔壁有一个小帐篷，经过风吹雨打已经变得灰沉沉了，可是还搭得整齐得法，前面有几只木箱靠着帐篷放着。一个火炉烟筒耸在门帷外边，帐篷前面的土地已经打扫干净，而且泼过了水。一桶泡湿的衣服搁在一只木箱上。帐篷里收拾得清洁整齐。一辆A型跑车和一辆小小的自制拖车停在帐篷旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ma ladled stew into the tin plates, very little stew, and she laid the plates on the ground. "I can't send 'em away," she said. "I don' know what to do. Take your plates an' go inside. I'll let 'em have what's lef'. Here, take a plate in to Rosasharn." She smiled up at the children. "Look," she said, "you little fellas go an' get you each a flat stick an' I'll put what's lef' for you. But they ain't to be no fightin'." The group broke up with a deadly, silent swiftness. Children ran to find sticks, they ran to their own tents and brought spoons. Before Ma had finished with the plates they were back, silent and wolfish. Ma shook her head. "I dunno what to do. I can't rob the fambly. I got to feed the fambly. Ruthie, Winfiel', Al," she cried fiercely. "Take your plates. Hurry up. Git in the tent quick." She looked apologetically at the waiting children. "There ain't enough," she said humbly. "I'm a-gonna set this here kettle out, an' you'll all get a little tas', but it ain't gonna do you no good." She faltered, "I can't he'p it. Can't keep it from you." She lifted the pot and set it down on the ground. "Now wait. It's too hot," she said, and she went into the tent quickly so she would not see. Her family sat on the ground, each with his plate; and outside they could hear the children digging into the pot with their sticks and their spoons and their pieces of rusty tin. A mound of children smothered the pot from sight. They did not talk, did not fight or argue; but there was a quiet intentness in all of them, a wooden fierceness. Ma turned her back so she couldn't see. "We can't do that no more," she said. "We got to eat alone." There was the sound of scraping at the kettle, and then the mound of children broke and the children walked away and left the scraped kettle on the ground. Ma looked at the empty plates. "Didn' none of you get nowhere near enough."</div>

Somewhere in the camp a guitar sounded, slow chords, struck without any sequence, practice chords. Tom stopped and listened, and then he moved slowly along the side of the road, and every few steps he stopped to listen again. He had gone a quarter of a mile before he heard what he listened for.

<div class="line_en">"Detour, I guess," Tom said. He slowed the car and stopped it, and immediately a crowd of men swarmed about the truck. They were armed with pick handles and shotguns. They wore trench helmets and some American Legion caps. One man leaned in the window, and the warm smell of whisky preceded him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是要绕道了，”汤姆说。他把汽车开慢，然后停下来，于是立刻就有一群人拥过来把卡车围住了。他们拿着铁镐把儿和散弹枪做武器，有的戴着战壕里用的钢盔，有的戴着美国退伍军人会的帽子。一个人把头探进了车窗，首先带来一股热腾腾的威士忌的气味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom stiffened. His hand crept down to the floor and felt for the jack handle. Ma caught his arm and held it powerfully. Tom said, "Well --" and then his voice took on a servile whine. "We're strangers here," he said. "We heard about they's work in a place called Tulare."</div>

In a few moments there came the sounds of shouts and screams, and then a flaring light arose from the direction of the Hooverville. The light grew and spread, and from the distance came a crackling sound. Tom got in the truck again. He turned around and ran up the dirt road without lights. At the highway he turned south again, and he turned on his lights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“出去看看。我们可不能往北去。”公路上那些红灯又向前移动了。汤姆眼看着他们经过了那条土路的路口，继续往前走去。不到几分钟，便传来了一阵喊声和惊叫声，于是从胡佛村那方面升起了熊熊的火光。那火光扩大起来，蔓延开来，远远地又传来了爆裂的响声。汤姆又回到卡车上。他掉转车头，不开车灯，顺着土路往前走。一到公路上，他就重新往南转过去，拧亮了车灯。">查看中文翻译</div>
