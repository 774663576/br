<div class="line_en">She had always found him difficult. She never had been able to praise him to his face, she remembered. And that reduced their relationship to something neutral, without that element of sex in it which made his manner to Minta so gallant, almost gay. He would pick a flower for her, lend her his books. But could he believe that Minta read them? She dragged them about the garden, sticking in leaves to mark the place.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, that is their boat, Lily Briscoe decided, standing on the edge of the lawn. It was the boat with greyish-brown sails, which she saw now flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the bay. There he sits, she thought, and the children are quite silent still. And she could not reach him either. The sympathy she had not given him weighed her down. It made it difficult for her to paint.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is it a boat? Is it a cork?" she would say, Lily repeated, turning back, reluctantly again, to her canvas. Heaven be praised for it, the problem of space remained, she thought, taking up her brush again. It glared at her. The whole mass of the picture was poised upon that weight. Beautiful and bright it should be on the surface, feathery and evanescent, one colour melting into another like the colours on a butterfly's wing; but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with bolts of iron. It was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses. And she began to lay on a red, a grey, and she began to model her way into the hollow there. At the same time, she seemed to be sitting beside Mrs Ramsay on the beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是只船吗？还是钓鱼的浮子？”她会问，莉莉重复着这话，很勉强地转身回到画布前。真得感谢老天，那片空白的问题依然存在，她心想，重又拿起了画笔。那片空白瞪着她。画面的整体平衡取决于这个砝码。画的表面应该明亮美丽，轻盈纤软，像蝴蝶翅膀上的颜色那样，色彩相互交融。但是在它的下面，整个结构必须用铁螺栓夹在一起。它将是你可以轻轻一吹就起皱、而同时一组马也休想拉得散的东西。她开始涂上一抹红色，一抹灰色，开始一点点按自己的意愿塑造这片空白。同时她又似乎在海滩上坐在拉姆齐夫人的身边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Ramsay sat silent. She was glad, Lily thought, to rest in silence, uncommunicative; to rest in the extreme obscurity of human relationships. Who knows what we are, what we feel? Who knows even at the moment of intimacy, This is knowledge? Aren't things spoilt then, Mrs Ramsay may have asked (it seemed to have happened so often, this silence by her side) by saying them? Aren't we more expressive thus? The moment at least seemed extraordinarily fertile. She rammed a little hole in the sand and covered it up, by way of burying in it the perfection of the moment. It was like a drop of silver in which one dipped and illumined the darkness of the past.</div>

Steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the horizon. Charles threw stones and sent them skipping.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lily stepped back to get her canvas -- so -- into perspective. It was an odd road to be walking, this further, until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank, perfectly alone, over the sea. And as she dipped into the blue paint, she dipped too into the past there. Now Mrs Ramsay got up, she remembered. It was time to go back to the house -- time for luncheon. And they all walked up from the beach together, she walking behind with William Bankes, and there was Minta in front of them with a hole in her stocking. How that little round hole of pink heel seemed to flaunt itself before them! How William Bankes deplored it, without, so far as she could remember, saying anything about it! It meant to him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt and disorder, and servants leaving and beds not made at mid-day -- all the things he most abhorred. He had a way of shuddering and spreading his fingers out as if to cover an unsightly object which he did now -- holding his hand in front of him. And Minta walked on ahead, and presumably Paul met her and she went off with Paul in the garden.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Rayleys, thought Lily Briscoe, squeezing her tube of green paint. She collected her impressions of the Rayleys. Their lives appeared to her in a series of scenes; one, on the staircase at dawn. Paul had come in and gone to bed early; Minta was late. There was Minta, wreathed, tinted, garish on the stairs about three o'clock in the morning. Paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of burglars. Minta was eating a sandwich, standing half-way up by a window, in the cadaverous early morning light, and the carpet had a hole in it. But what did they say? Lily asked herself, as if by looking she could hear them. Minta went on eating her sandwich, annoyingly, while he spoke something violent, abusing her, in a mutter so as not to wake the children, the two little boys. He was withered, drawn; she flamboyant, careless. For things had worked loose after the first year or so; the marriage had turned out rather badly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷勒夫妇，莉莉·布里斯柯回忆着，一面在挤一管绿色的颜料。她搜索着对雷勒夫妇的印象。他们的生活以一系列的片段场景出现在她的记忆中；其中一幕是在黎明时的楼梯上。保罗头天晚上回来得早，睡觉也早；明塔回来得晚；凌晨三点钟左右，明塔头戴花环，涂脂抹粉、打扮得花花绿绿的出现在楼梯上。保罗穿着睡衣走了出来，手里拿着根拨火根，以防碰上入室盗窃的贼。明塔站在楼梯半中间的窗前，在苍白的晨光中吃三明治，地毯上有一个洞；但是他们说了些什么？莉莉问自己，好像只要看着他们就能听见他们的声音。很激烈的话语。明塔令人生气地继续吃她的三明治，说话的是他。他说的是气愤的、妒忌的话语，责骂她，声音很低，免得吵醒孩子，那两个小男孩。他神情沮丧、拉长了脸；她则招摇艳丽、满不在乎。结婚一年左右他们的关系就稀松了；这场婚姻结果很槽糕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another time, Paul said he "played chess in coffee-houses." She had built up a whole structure of imagination on that saying too. She remembered how, as he said it, she thought how he rang up the servant, and she said, "Mrs Rayley's out, sir," and he decided that he would not come home either. She saw him sitting in the corner of some lugubrious place where the smoke attached itself to the red plush seats, and the waitresses got to know you, and he played chess with a little man who was in the tea trade and lived at Surbiton, but that was all Paul knew about him. And then Minta was out when he came home and then there was that scene on the stairs, when he got the poker in case of burglars (no doubt to frighten her too) and spoke so bitterly, saying she had ruined his life. At any rate when she went down to see them at a cottage near Rickmansworth, things were horribly strained. Paul took her down the garden to look at the Belgian hares which he bred, and Minta followed them, singing, and put her bare arm on his shoulder, lest he should tell her anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">Minta was bored by hares, Lily thought. But Minta never gave herself away. She never said things like that about playing chess in coffee- houses. She was far too conscious, far too wary. But to go on with their story -- they had got through the dangerous stage by now. She had been staying with them last summer some time and the car broke down and Minta had to hand him his tools. He sat on the road mending the car, and it was the way she gave him the tools -- business-like, straightforward, friendly -- that proved it was all right now. They were "in love" no longer; no, he had taken up with another woman, a serious woman, with her hair in a plait and a case in her hand (Minta had described her gratefully, almost admiringly), who went to meetings and shared Paul's views (they had got more and more pronounced) about the taxation of land values and a capital levy. Far from breaking up the marriage, that alliance had righted it. They were excellent friends, obviously, as he sat on the road and she handed him his tools.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明塔厌烦兔子，莉莉想道。但是明塔从未流露出来过。她从不说在咖啡厅下棋一类的事。她对此太敏感，惟恐提起。但是还是接着讲他们的故事吧——现在他们已经度过了危险阶段。她去年夏天有段时间住在他们家，汽车坏了，明塔不得不给他递工具。他坐在路边修车，她给他递工具时的样子——事务性的、坦率的、友好的——证明情况正常了。他们不再“相爱”；不了，他已经有了另外一个女人，一个严肃的女人，头发梳成辫子，手里提个文件箱（明培曾充满感激地、几乎是带看羡慕地描述过她），她参加会议，在地价税和资本课税问题上和保罗有着共同的观点（这些观点变得越来越鲜明了）。他们之间的这个关系不仅没有使保罗和明塔的婚姻解体，反而拯救了它，当他坐人路边她给他递工具时，显然他们是极好的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So that was the story of the Rayleys, Lily thought. She imagined herself telling it to Mrs Ramsay, who would be full of curiosity to know what had become of the Rayleys. She would feel a little triumphant, telling Mrs Ramsay that the marriage had not been a success.</div>

They're happy like that; I'm happy like this. Life has changed completely. At that all her being, even her beauty, became for a moment, dusty and out of date. For a moment Lily, standing there, with the sun hot on her back, summing up the Rayleys, triumphed over Mrs Ramsay, who would never know how Paul went to coffee-houses and had a mistress; how he sat on the ground and Minta handed him his tools; how she stood here painting, had never married, not even William Bankes.</div>

<div class="line_en">(Suddenly, as suddenly as a star slides in the sky, a reddish light seemed to burn in her mind, covering Paul Rayley, issuing from him. It rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a distant beach. She heard the roar and the crackle. The whole sea for miles round ran red and gold. Some winey smell mixed with it and intoxicated her, for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw herself off the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a beach. And the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear and disgust, as if while she saw its splendour and power she saw too how it fed on the treasure of the house, greedily, disgustingly, and she loathed it. But for a sight, for a glory it surpassed everything in her experience, and burnt year after year like a signal fire on a desert island at the edge of the sea, and one had only to say "in love" and instantly, as happened now, up rose Paul's fire again. And it sank and she said to herself, laughing, "The Rayleys"; how Paul went to coffee-houses and played chess.)</div>

He was "the first scientist of his age, my husband says."

So they were sent for walks together, and she was told, with that faint touch of irony that made Mrs Ramsay slip through one's fingers, that she had a scientific mind; she liked flowers; she was so exact.

She had been looking at the table-cloth, and it had flashed upon her that she would move the tree to the middle, and need never marry anybody, and she had felt an enormous exultation. She had felt, now she could stand up to Mrs Ramsay -- a tribute to the astonishing power that Mrs Ramsay had over one. Do this, she said, and one did it. Even her shadow at the window with James was full of authority. She remembered how William Bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance of mother and son. Did she not admire their beauty? he said. But William, she remembered, had listened to her with his wise child's eyes when she explained how it was not irreverence: how a light there needed a shadow there and so on. She did not intend to disparage a subject which, they agreed, Raphael had treated divinely. She was not cynical. Quite the contrary. Thanks to his scientific mind he understood -- a proof of disinterested intelligence which had pleased her and comforted her enormously. One could talk of painting then seriously to a man. Indeed, his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life. She loved William Bankes.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went to Hampton Court and he always left her, like the perfect gentleman he was, plenty of time to wash her hands, while he strolled by the river. That was typical of their relationship. Many things were left unsaid. Then they strolled through the courtyards, and admired, summer after summer, the proportions and the flowers, and he would tell her things, about perspective, about architecture, as they walked, and he would stop to look at a tree, or the view over the lake, and admire a child --(it was his great grief -- he had no daughter) in the spent so much time in laboratories that the world when he came out seemed to dazzle him, so that he walked slowly, lifted his hand to screen his eyes and paused, with his head thrown back, merely to breathe the air. Then he would tell her how his housekeeper was on her holiday; he must buy a new carpet for the staircase. Perhaps she would go with him to buy a new carpet for the staircase. And once something led him to talk about the Ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had been wearing a grey hat; she was not more than nineteen or twenty. She was astonishingly beautiful. There he stood looking down the avenue at Hampton Court as if he could see her there among the fountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一起到汉普顿宫去玩，他真是个十足的绅士，总是到河边散步，好让她有足够的时间用洗手间。这反映了他们关系的特点。在许多事情上都相互默契。那时他们一个夏天又一个夏天地在汉普顿官众多的庭院中漫步，欣赏建筑的协调和满园鲜花，他便会一边走一边给她讲各种事情，透视法啦、建筑学啦，有时他会停下来端详一棵树，或湖上的景色，或含含糊糊地、神情冷淡地夸夸一个小孩（他没有女儿——这是他最伤心的事情）。对于一个把这么多时间都化在实验室的男人来说，这种神态是很自然的，因为他一出门这个外部世界似乎就会使他眼花缭乱，因此他走得很慢，抬起手来遮住射进眼睛的阳光，停下脚步，把头使劲往后一仰，就为了深深地吸上一口气。然后他会告诉她他的管家休息了；他必须买块新地毯铺楼梯。也许她愿意和他一起去给楼梯买块新地毯吧。有一次，一件什么事使他谈起了拉姆齐夫妇。他说他第一次见到她时她戴着一顶灰色的帽子；顶多不过十九或二十岁。她惊人地美丽。他站在那儿凝视着汉普顿官的林荫路，仿佛他仍能在喷泉之间看到她的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>
