<div class="line_en">There are places where the changing seasons are marked by migrating birds, or the ebb and flow of tides. Here, in our little town, it was the return of the tourists. At first, a tentative trickle, stepping off trains or out of cars in brightly coloured waterproof coats, clutching their guidebooks and National Trust membership; then, as the air warmed, and the season crept forwards, disgorged alongside the belch and hiss of their coaches, clogging up the high street, Americans, Japanese and packs of foreign schoolchildren were dotted around the perimeter of the castle.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the winter months little stayed open. The wealthier shop owners took advantage of the long bleak months to disappear to holiday homes abroad, while the more determined hosted Christmas events, capitalizing on occasional carol concerts in the grounds, or festive craft fairs. But then as the temperatures slid higher, the castle car parks would become studded with vehicles, the local pubs chalk up an increase in requests for a ploughman's lunch and, within a few sunny Sundays, we had morphed again from being a sleepy market town into a traditional English tourist destination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冬季的那几个月，很少有商店营业。富裕些的店主会趁这漫长而阴冷的日子去国外的度假别墅，更有果断些的人则举办圣诞庆祝活动，办临时的圣歌音乐会和节日工艺品展览会赚取利润。但是温度升高后，城堡的停车场会挤满车辆，附近小酒店的简便午餐供不应求。不出几个明媚的星期天之后，我们这儿就从一个沉寂的集镇变为一个传统的英国旅游胜地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked up the hill, dodging this season's hovering early few as they clutched their neoprene bumbags and well-thumbed tourist guides, their cameras already poised to capture mementoes of the castle in spring. I smiled at a few, paused to take photographs of others with proffered cameras. Some locals complained about the tourist season -- the traffic jams, the overwhelmed public toilets, the demands for strange comestibles in The Buttered Bun cafe ("You don't do sushi? Not even hand roll?"). But I didn't I liked the breath of foreign air, the close-up glimpses of lives far removed from my own. I liked to hear the accents and work out where their owners came from, to study the clothes of people who had never seen a Next catalogue or bought a five-pack of knickers at Marks and Spencer's</div>

This seemed the ideal start -- a nice day out, less than half an hour's drive away.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had it all planned, you see. We would arrive at the racecourse on a beautiful sunny day. There would be burnished, stick-legged thoroughbreds, their jockeys in billowing bright silks, careening past. Perhaps a brass band or two. The stands would be full of cheering people, and we would find a space from which to wave our winning betting slips. Will's competitive streak would kick in and he would be unable to resist calculating the odds and making sure he won more than either Nathan or me. I had worked it all out. And then, when we had had enough of watching the horses, we would go to the well-reviewed racecourse restaurant and have a slap-up meal.</div>

<div class="line_en">It started with the car park. We drove there without incident, me now a little more confident that I wasn't going to tip Will over if I went faster than 15 mph. I had looked up the directions at the library, and kept up a cheerful banter almost the whole way there, commenting on the beautiful blue sky, the countryside, the lack of traffic. There were no queues to enter the racecourse, which was, admittedly, a little less grand than I had expected, and the car park was clearly marked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="变数从停车场开始。我们平安到达，现在我开车更加有自信了，即便速度超过每小时15英里，也不会把威尔翻倒。我在图书馆查过路线，几乎一路谈笑风生，谈论美丽的蓝天、乡村景色和通畅的交通。进入赛马场不需要排队，老实说，赛马场比我想象的还要大一点，停车场也标志得很清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But nobody had warned me it was on grass, and grass that had been driven over for much of a wet winter at that. We backed into a space (not hard, as it was only half full) and almost as soon as the ramp was down Nathan looked worried.</div>

<div class="line_en">We tilted Will backwards. I took one handle and Nathan took the other and we dragged the chair towards the path. It was slow progress, not least because I had to keep stopping because my arms hurt and my pristine boots grew thick with dirt. When we finally made it to the pathway, Will's blanket had half slipped off him and had somehow got caught up in his wheels, leaving one corner torn and muddy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们把威尔向后倾斜。我抓住一个把手，内森抓住另一个，我们把轮椅拖向那条小路。前进缓慢，部分原因是我不时停下来，因为我的胳膊受伤了，新靴子沾了泥后变得很重。我们终于来到小路时，威尔的毯子有一半从他身上滑了下来，不知怎么的绞在了轮椅里，一个角被撕裂了，沾满泥浆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ah yes. The fun bit. Who thought it would be a good idea for racecourses to have turnstiles? It was hardly as if they needed crowd control, surely? It's not as if there were crowds of chanting racehorse fans, threatening riots if Charlie's Darling didn't make it back in third, rioting stable-girls who needed penning in and keeping out. We looked at the turnstile, and then back at Will's chair, and then Nathan and I looked at each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">We bought tickets for the stands, and then, almost faint with relief at finally having got there, I wheeled Will out to a sheltered area just to the side of the main stand. While Nathan sorted out Will's drink, I had some time to look at our fellow racegoers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们买了看台的票，到那儿时我有些许释然。我把威尔推到主看台边一个有遮蔽的地方。内森在给威尔调制饮料，我有了点儿空可以观察观察来看赛马的同道之人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside us, dotted along the stands and clutching polystyrene cups of coffee and hip flasks, were men in tweedy suits and women in smart padded coats. They looked a little more everyday, and their little badges were blue too. I suspected that many of them were trainers and grooms, or horsey people of some sort. Down at the front, by little whiteboards, stood the tic-tac men, their arms waving in some strange semaphore that I couldn't understand. They scribbled up new combinations of figures, and scrubbed them out again with the base of their sleeves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们旁边，穿着花呢衣服的男人和身着干练棉外套的女人，端着聚苯乙烯咖啡杯和酒瓶散布在看台边。他们看起来很普通，小徽章也是蓝色的。我觉得他们中很多人都是驯马师和马夫，或是爱马之人。从大厅前面下去，小白板旁站着几个摇滚男，他们摇摆着手臂，发出我不能理解的奇怪信号。他们胡乱摆成新的造型，又用他们的袖口抹掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was actually quite pleasant at the base of the stands, despite the occasional spit of rain. Above us, on a glass-fronted balcony, men in suits proffered champagne glasses to women in wedding outfits. They looked warm and cosy, and I suspected that was the Premier Area, listed next to some stratospheric price on the board in the ticket kiosk. They wore little badges on red thread, marking them out as special. I wondered briefly if it was possible to colour our blue ones a different shade, but decided that being the only people with a wheelchair would probably make us a little conspicuous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管不时有雨滴落下，但看台底部仍是一个让人愉悦的地方。我们上方，玻璃阳台上西装笔挺的男人向穿着婚纱的女人敬香槟酒。他们看上去温暖惬意，我怀疑那里是贵宾区，列在票亭里布告板上最高档次价格的旁边。他们佩戴着红线串起的小徽章，显出他们的特别。我突然想到是否可能用另一种色调标出我们的蓝色徽章，又觉得作为唯一有轮椅的我们，已经很显眼了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

I stood and watched them go, suddenly transfixed, unable to suppress a flurry of excitement at the tails suddenly streaming out behind them, the frantic efforts of the brightly coloured men atop them, all jostling for position. When the winner crossed the finishing line it was almost impossible not to cheer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我身边的那一小群人突然开始忙活，马儿们从起跑门猛冲出去，我一跃而起，看着它们奔跑，刹那间我呆若木鸡，不能抑制住心里的激动。川流不息的尾巴一拥而过，身穿鲜艳服装的男人骑在它们身上，疯狂地拉着缰绳，互相推挤着去争夺名次。当获胜者冲过终点线时，很难不欢呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, like some parody of a class system, around the parade ring stood a group of men in striped polo shirts, who clutched beer cans and who seemed to be on some kind of outing. Their shaved heads suggested some kind of military service. Periodically they would break out into song, or begin some noisy, physical altercation, ramming each other with blunt heads or wrapping their arms around each other's necks. As I passed to go to the loo, they catcalled me in my short skirt (I appeared to be the only person in the whole of the stands in a skirt) and I flipped them the finger behind my back. And then they lost interest as seven or eight horses began skirting around each other, eased into the stands with workmanlike skill, all preparing for the next race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，就像对阶级体制的嘲弄，一群身穿斑纹马球衫的小伙子们站在亮马圈，他们紧抓着啤酒罐，似乎是在进行郊游。光光的脑袋表明他们在服兵役。他们偶尔会唱首歌，发生一些喧闹的口角，用愚钝的脑袋互相撞击，用胳膊环住对方的脖子。我去洗手间时经过他们身边，他们对我发出尖叫，对我的短裙指指点点（我似乎是整个看台上唯一穿短裙的），我在背后对他们伸出中指。当有七八匹马开始通过时，他们对我失去了兴趣，灵巧地溜进看台，准备看下一场赛马。">查看中文翻译</div>

I could see them monitoring Will out of the corners of their eyes, periodically muttering to each other when they thought we weren't looking. Poor man, I could practically hear them saying. What a terrible way to live. I gave them a hard stare, daring them to look at him like that. I tried not to think too hard about what Will must be feeling.</div>
