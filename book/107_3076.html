<div class="line_en">Old Dr Grantly, who had for many years occupied the bishop's chair, was dying, just as the government of the country was about to change. The bishop's son, Archdeacon Grantly, had recently taken on many of his father's duties, and it was fairly well understood that the present prime minister would choose him as the new bishop. It was a difficult time for the archdeacon. The prime minister had never promised him the post in so many words, but those who know anything of government will be well aware that encouragement is often given by a whisper from a great man or one of his friends. The archdeacon had heard such a whisper, and allowed himself to hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年来，稳坐主教宝座的一直是老格兰特利博士，如今他大限将至，正是国内政权即将更迭之时。执事长格兰特利是主教的儿子，最近刚刚接手了父亲的不少职责。普遍认为，现任首相会选他为新主教。对于执事长而言，这段日子很难挨。首相从未对他作出太多言语上的承诺。不过，对政府多少有些了解的人都很清楚，大人物或首相的朋友往往吹吹耳风，就能怂恿他做决定。执事长听说有人为他吹了耳风，就抱了希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A month ago, the doctors had said the old man would live just four more weeks. Only yesterday they had examined him again, expressed their surprise, and given him another two weeks. Now the son was sitting by his father's bedside, calculating his chances. The government would fall within five days, that much was certain; his father would die within -- no, he refused to think that. He tried to keep his mind on other matters, but the race was so very close, and the prize so very great. He looked at the dying man's calm face. As far as he and the doctors could judge, life might yet hang there for weeks to come. The old bishop slept for twenty of the twenty-four hours, but during his waking moments he was able to recognize both his son and his dear old friend, Mr Harding, the archdeacon's father-in-law. Now he lay sleeping like a baby. Nothing could be easier than the old man's passing from this world to the next.</div>

For weeks after he was gone, the idea of future happiness in this world was hateful to the young widow; tears and sleep were her only relief.

So, because Dr Proudie was guided by his wife, Mr Slope had, through Mrs Proudie, gained a good deal of control over Dr Proudie's religious thinking. When Dr Proudie was appointed Bishop of Barchester, Mr Slope was happy to give up his post as vicar in a poor part of London, to become chaplain to the bishop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这些宗教问题上，普劳蒂太太心甘情愿地听命于一位年轻的神职人员——斯洛普先生。这样一来，由于普劳蒂博士对妻子唯命是从，斯洛普先生就通过普劳蒂太太，有力地控制了普劳蒂博士的宗教思想。普劳蒂博士被任命为巴彻斯特主教之后，斯洛普先生高高兴兴地放弃了伦敦某个贫民区的代牧一职，当了主教的特遣牧师。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Obadiah Slope and Mrs Proudie shared similar religious beliefs; their relationship was close and their conversations confidential. Mr Slope had regularly visited the Proudies' London home and knew the Misses Proudie well. It was no more than natural that his heart should discover some softer feeling than friendship for Mrs Proudie's eldest daughter, Olivia, and he made a declaration of affection to her. However, after finding how little money her father would give her on marrying, he withdrew his offer. As soon as it was known that Dr Proudie would become bishop, Mr Slope regretted his earlier caution, and began to look more kindly on Miss Proudie again. But he had lost his chance; Olivia was too proud to look at him a second time, and, besides, she had another lover showing interest in her. So Mr Slope sighed his lover's sighs without reward, and the two of them soon found it convenient to develop a hatred for each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥巴代亚·斯洛普和普劳蒂太太有相似的宗教信仰，两人关系密切，谈话推心置腹。以前在伦敦时，斯洛普先生就总是定期登门拜访普劳蒂一家，跟几位普劳蒂小姐混得很熟。自然而然，他心里对普劳蒂太太的长女奥利维娅产生了超出友谊的柔情，并且曾向她表白。然而，当他发现奥利维娅的父亲给不了几个钱的嫁妆，就收回了他的话。普劳蒂博士即将当上主教的消息一传开，斯洛普先生立刻对当初的谨慎追悔莫及，开始重新对普劳蒂小姐表示好感。可他已经没机会了。奥利维娅自尊心太强，不愿给他第二次机会，更何况眼下有另一位追求者在向她示爱。于是，斯洛普先生只得为爱情空叹一声，两人也很快发现相互怀恨非常合宜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It may seem strange that Mrs Proudie's friendship for the young vicar should remain firm in such circumstances, but to tell the truth, she had known nothing of his relationship with Olivia. Although very fond of him herself, she expected her daughters to make much more impressive marriages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这种情况下，普劳蒂太太竟然还能牢牢维系与这个年轻代牧的友情，看起来也许有点奇怪。但事实上，对于斯洛普先生和奥利维娅之间的关系，她一无所知。她对斯洛普先生很有好感，却还是希望女儿们能嫁得更好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Slope soon comforted himself with the thought that, as chaplain to the bishop, he might become richer and more powerful than if he had married the bishop's daughter. As he sat in the train, facing Dr and Mrs Proudie as they started their first journey to Barchester, he began to make a plan for his future life. He understood, correctly, that public life would suit the new bishop better than the small details of cathedral business. Therefore, he, Slope, would in effect be Bishop of Barchester. He knew he would have a hard battle to fight, because power would be equally desired by another great mind -- Mrs Proudie would also choose to be Bishop of Barchester. He felt confident, however, that he would win in the end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，斯洛普先生就有了聊以自慰的想法：如今他当上了主教的特遣牧师，可能会比娶主教的女儿还有钱有势。等到他跟普劳蒂博士夫妇面对面地坐在火车上，第一次前往巴彻斯特的时候，他已经开始为将来的生活打算了。他有一种合情合理的认识：相对于教堂事务的繁文缛节，公共生活更适合新任主教。这样一来，他斯洛普就成了巴彻斯特事实上的主教。他明白自己还得打一场硬仗，因为另一个有头脑的人也在觊觎权力——普劳蒂太太也想成为巴彻斯特主教。不过他信心十足，认为自己会是最后的赢家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In appearance he was tall, with large hands and feet, but on the whole his figure was good. His face, however, was the colour of bad-quality beef, and his hair, which was long, straight, and a dull reddish colour, was kept plentifully oiled. His mouth was large, but his lips were thin and bloodless. It was not a pleasant experience to shake his hand, as there was always a cold dampness to his skin. His face usually wore a frown, as if he thought most of the world far too wicked for his care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从外形上看，斯洛普先生个头高，手脚大，但整体来说身材不错。然而，他的脸是劣质牛肉的颜色，暗红色头发又长又直，总是擦着很多的头油。他嘴形宽阔，嘴唇却单薄无血色。跟他握手可不是一件舒服的事，因为他的皮肤总是又冷又潮。他总是眉头紧锁，似乎是觉得世上的大多数事物过于罪恶，他不屑一顾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A man of courage and above average intelligence, he firmly believed, like Dr Proudie, in simplifying church ceremony, and like Mrs Proudie, in enforcing total respect for Sunday churchgoing. He had excellent powers of self-expression, which were appreciated more by women than by men. A frequent guest in many London homes, he had been admired by the ladies and unwillingly accepted by the men, but he had an oily, unpleasant way with him which did not seem likely to make him popular in Barchester society.</div>
