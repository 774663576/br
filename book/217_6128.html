<div class="line_en">We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim – and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.</div>

<div class="line_en">We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们睡了几乎一整天，在晚上才动身，这时看到了前边不远处，有一只长得出奇的木排。木排之长，仿佛象一个好大的游行队伍一般。木排上每一头有四根长桨①，因此我们估摸他们可能共有三十来个人之多。上面有五处窝棚，彼此离得很开。在中间的地方，露天生了个篝火。两头竖起了高高的旗竿。那个派头非同一般。它仿佛在大声宣告，在这样的大排上当个伙计，才称得上是个人物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it warn't. It was Jack-o' -- lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he WAS most free – and who was to blame for it? Why, ME. I couldn't get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every time, "But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody." That was so – I couldn't get around that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, "What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. THAT'S what she done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是并非灯火。那不过是些鬼火或者是萤火虫罢了。他便又坐了下来，象刚才那样，又盯着望。杰姆说，眼看自由就在眼前，他浑身发抖、发热。啊，我要说的是，听他这么一说，也叫我全身发抖发热。因为在我的脑子里，也开始在形成一个观念，这便是，他快要自由了。——那么，这事该怪罪谁呢？啊，该怪罪我啊。不管怎么说，不管什么个办法，在我的良心上，这一点就是去不掉。这可叫我坐立不安啊。在过去，我从没有想到这一层，从没有想到自己正在干的究竟是什么一回事。可是现在想到了，认真想过了，这叫我越来越心焦。我也曾试图给自己辩解，说这怪罪不得我，因为我可没有叫杰姆从他那个合理合法的主人那儿逃跑啊。可是辩解也没有什么用。每一回，良心会站出来，说道：“可是你明明知道他为了自由正在逃跑啊，你尽可以划到岸上去，向人家告发他啊。”这话说得不错——这个理是我绕不过去的，无法绕过去。这是直刺良心的，良心对我这么说，“可怜的华珍小姐有什么地方亏待了你，你竟然可以明明看见她的黑奴在你的眼皮底下逃掉，却从未说过任何一个字？那个可怜的老妇人有什么地方对不住你，你竟然这样卑鄙地对待她？啊，她想方设法要你好好读你的书，她想方设法要你有规有矩，她一桩桩、一件件，凡是能见到的，总是想尽办法对你好。她可就是那么样对待你的啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, "Dah's Cairo!" it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it WAS Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只觉得自己太卑鄙了，太难受了，但愿就此死了的好。我在木筏上忐忑不安地走来走去，一边怪怨自己，而杰姆也在忐忑不安地在我身边走来走去。我们两人，谁也安不下心来。每一次，他跳起了舞，说道，“开罗到啦！”我就中了一枪，并且刺透了我的心。我这时心想，要真是开罗的话，我真会难受得死过去①。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, "Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell." Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children – children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到他这样说，我几乎全身冰凉。在他一生中，在今天以前，他决不敢说出这样的话来。可见当他断定自己快要自由的这一刹那间，他这人的变化有多么大。正是老话说得好：“给黑奴一寸，他便要一尺。”我心想，这全只是因为我没有好好地想一想，才会有如此的结果啊。在我的面前，如今正是这么一个黑奴，我一直等于在帮着他逃跑，如今竟然这么露骨地说什么他要偷走他的孩子们——这些孩子原本是属于一个我所不认识的人的，而且此人从来也没有害过我啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我自言自语的时候，杰姆不停地高声讲话。他在说，一到了自由州，他第一件事要干些什么，那就是拼命挣钱，决不乱花一分钱，等到积聚得够数目了，便要把老婆赎买回来。她如今是属于一家农庄的，地点靠近华珍小姐那里。然后他们两个人要拼命干活，好把两个小孩赎买回来。还说，要是他们那个主人不肯卖他们的话，他们就要找个反对黑奴制度的人，把孩子们偷出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it.

Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us.

I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her.</div>
