<div class="line_en">Standing in the middle of a crowd of his new colleagues in the cafeteria of the old Facebook building, Tyler Shultz listened to an emotional speech Elizabeth was giving. She was talking about her uncle's premature death from cancer and how an early warning from Theranos's blood tests could have prevented it. That was what she had spent the past ten years tirelessly working toward, she said teary-eyed, her voice catching: a world in which no one would have to say goodbye to a loved one too soon. Tyler found the message deeply inspiring. He had started working at Theranos less than a week earlier, after graduating from Stanford the previous spring and taking the summer off to backpack around Europe. There had been a lot to absorb in the space of a few days, not least of which was the news Elizabeth had called this all-employee meeting to announce: the company was going live with its technology in Walgreens stores.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler had first met Elizabeth in late 2011 when he'd dropped by his grandfather George's house near the Stanford campus. He was a junior then, majoring in mechanical engineering. Elizabeth's vision of instant and painless tests run on drops of blood collected from fingertips had struck an immediate chord with him. After interning at Theranos that summer, he'd changed his major to biology and applied for a full-time position at the company.</div>

<div class="line_en">His first day at work had been filled with drama. A woman named Anjali who headed the immunoassay team had quit, and a group of employees had gathered in the parking lot to say goodbye to her. Word was that Anjali and Elizabeth had had a big falling-out. Then, three days later, Tyler had been informed that the protein engineering group he'd originally been assigned to was being disbanded and everyone was being moved to the undermanned immunoassay team to help out. It was all a bit chaotic and confusing, but Elizabeth's stirring speech made his budding concerns melt away. He left the meeting energized and motivated to work really hard.</div>

<div class="line_en">A month into the job, Tyler met a new hire named Erika Cheung. Like Tyler, Erika was a newly minted college grad who'd majored in biology, but that was about all they had in common. With his dirty blond hair and famous grandfather, Tyler was a product of the establishment, while Erika came from a middle-class mixed-race family. Her father had emigrated to the United States from Hong Kong and worked his way up from package handler to engineering manager at UPS. She'd spent large stretches of her youth homeschooled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler and Erika competed to see who could get to $600 first -- the threshold beyond which the company had to report the payments as compensation to the IRS. One weekend, Theranos was looking for more volunteers, so Tyler recruited his four housemates to come give blood with him. They used their combined loot --$250-- to buy beer and burgers and threw a party that evening at the ramshackle house they rented a few blocks away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite their very different backgrounds, Tyler and Erika became fast friends. Their job on the immunoassay team was to help run experiments to verify the accuracy of blood tests on Theranos's Edison devices before they were deployed in the lab for use on patients. This verification process was known as "assay validation." The blood samples used for these experiments came from employees and sometimes from employees' friends and family members. To encourage employees to give blood, Theranos paid them $10 per tube. That meant you could make as much as $50 in one sitting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管出身背景截然不同，但泰勒和艾芮卡还是成了好朋友。两人在免疫测定团队的工作是做实验确认爱迪生的血液检验是准确的，然后才能将爱迪生部署到实验室用于病患身上。这个确认过程叫做「测定确效」（assay validation），所使用的血液样本来自员工，有时也来自员工的朋友和家属，为了鼓励员工提供血液，每一管血Theranos付十美元，也就是说坐下来抽一次血就可赚五十美元。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing that dampened Tyler's enthusiasm for working at Theranos was seeing the inside of an Edison. During his internship the previous summer, he hadn't been allowed near one, so his anticipation was high when a Chinese scientist named Ran Hu showed him one of the machines with its black-and-white case removed. Standing next to Tyler was Aruna Ayer, his supervisor. Aruna was just as curious as he was: in her previous role as head of the protein engineering group, she had never seen an Edison either. As Ran did a quick demonstration, Tyler and Aruna weren't sure what to think. The device seemed to consist of nothing more than a pipette fastened to a robotic arm that moved back and forth on a gantry. Both had envisioned some sort of sophisticated microfluidic system. But this seemed like something a middle-schooler could build in his garage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒的工作热忱第一次被泼冷水，是在他看到爱迪生内部的当下。前一年暑假到Theranos实习时，他连靠近爱迪生都不可以，所以当中国科学家胡然（Ran Hu）把一台拿掉黑白外壳的爱迪生给他看时，他的期待非常高。站在他旁边的，还有上司阿鲁娜．耶儿（Aruna Ayer），阿鲁娜也跟他一样好奇，她原本是蛋白质工程团队主管，也没看过爱迪生。胡然快速展示一遍后，泰勒和阿鲁娜都不知道该做何感想。这个设备似乎只是把吸量管绑在一个能前后移动的机器手臂上，他们两人都以为能看到复杂的微流控设备之类的，但眼前这台比较像是中学生也能在车库做出来的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon, there were other things that began to trouble Tyler. One type of experiment he and Erika were tasked with doing involved retesting blood samples on the Edisons over and over to measure how much their results varied. The data collected were used to calculate each Edison blood test's coefficient of variation, or CV. A test is generally considered precise if its CV is less than 10 percent. To Tyler's dismay, data runs that didn't achieve low enough CVs were simply discarded and the experiments repeated until the desired number was reached. It was as if you flipped a coin enough times to get ten heads in a row and then declared that the coin always returned heads. Even within the "good" data runs, Tyler and Erika noticed that some values were deemed outliers and deleted. When Erika asked the group's more senior scientists how they defined an outlier, no one could give her a straight answer. Erika and Tyler might be young and inexperienced, but they both knew that cherry-picking data wasn't good science. Nor were they the only ones who had concerns about these practices. Aruna, whom Tyler liked and respected, also disapproved of them and so did Michael Humbert, a jovial German scientist Tyler had befriended.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久，有其他事开始困扰泰勒。他和艾芮卡负责的实验需要一再用爱迪生来检测血液样本，观察每次结果的差异变化，再用这些数据计算爱迪生每次检验的变异系数（coefficient of variation），一般来说，只要变异系数在一〇％以下，检验就算准确。令泰勒惊讶的是，变异系数不够低的数据会直接舍弃不用，实验一再重复做，直到得出想要的数字为止，就好像丢铜板的次数多到可连续丢出十个正面，然后就宣称每次都扔出正面。即使是「有效」数据，泰勒和艾芮卡也发现有些数值会被视为异常值（outlier）并删除，就算艾芮卡去问团队比较资深科学家异常值的定义为何，也没有人能给她一个直接的答案。艾芮卡和泰勒也许年轻、没经验，但两人都知道用「采樱桃」方式专挑有利的数据并不是好科学。他们并不是唯一对这些做法有疑虑的人，泰勒很喜欢且敬重的阿鲁娜也不认同，还有麦克．杭伯特（Michael Humbert）也是，他是友善乐天的德国科学家，跟泰勒是好朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When its case was back on, the Edison did sport a touchscreen software interface, but even that was a letdown. You had to pound on the screen's icons to get it to work. Tyler and some other members of the group joked that Steve Jobs would have rolled over in his grave if he had seen one of them. Tyler felt a wave of disappointment wash over him but beat it back by telling himself that the 4S, the next-generation device he had heard was in the works, was probably much more intricate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外壳装回之后，爱迪生就换上了触摸屏幕软件接口，但即使如此仍然令人失望，屏幕上的图标必须用力按才有反应，泰勒和其他几个同事开玩笑说，贾伯斯如果看到一定会从坟墓爬起来。泰勒感觉一股失望向他袭来，但他用力把它压回去，告诉自己，他耳闻正在开发的下一代设备「4S」应该会精细很多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Erika and Tyler thought Theranos was also being misleading about the accuracy of other Edison tests, such as a test to measure vitamin D. When a blood sample would be tested on an analyzer made by the Italian company DiaSorin, it might show a vitamin D concentration of 20 nanograms per milliliter, which was considered adequate for a healthy patient. But when Erika tested the same sample on the Edison, the result would be 10 or 12 nanograms per milliliter -- a value that signified a vitamin D deficiency. The Edison's vitamin D test was nonetheless cleared for use in the clinical lab on live patient samples, as were two Edison thyroid hormone tests and a test to measure PSA, the prostate cancer marker.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾芮卡和泰勒认为，Theranos对爱迪生其他检测的准确性也有误导之嫌，譬如维他命D检测。拿一份样本用意大利公司代所润的分析仪做检测时，可能出现的维他命D浓度是每毫升二十奈克（nanogram），属于健康人的正常范围，但艾芮卡同样拿那份样本放进爱迪生检测时，得出的结果却是每毫升十或十二奈克，这个数值代表维他命D不足。然而，爱迪生的维他命D检测却获得放行可用于临床实验室，用来检测活生生的病患样本。爱迪生另外两个甲状腺激素检验以及摄护腺特异抗原检验（摄护腺癌的标记），也是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the validation experiments Tyler helped with involved a test to detect syphilis. Some tests measure the concentration of a substance in the blood, such as cholesterol, to determine whether it is too high. Others, like the syphilis test, provide a yes-or-no answer about whether a patient has a particular disease or not. The accuracy of those tests is gauged by their sensitivity -- the measure of how often they correctly label someone with the disease as positive. Over a period of several days, Tyler and several colleagues tested 247 blood samples on Edisons, 66 of which were known to be positive for the disease. During the first run, the devices correctly detected only 65 percent of the positive samples. During the second run, they correctly detected 80 percent of them. Yet, in its validation report, Theranos stated that its syphilis test had a sensitivity of 95 percent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒帮忙做的「确效实验」中，有一项需要做梅毒检测。有些检测是测量血中某一物质的浓度，譬如胆固醇，以此判定该物质是不是过高；还有些检测（譬如梅毒检测），是提供「有」或「无」的答案，告诉病患有没有罹患某一种疾病，这类检测的准确性是根据「敏感度」（sensitivity）来评断，而所谓敏感度就是：正确无误地检测出罹病者为「阳性」的比例。一连好几天，泰勒和几位同事用爱迪生检测了二百四十七份血液样本，其中有六十六份已确定对某疾病呈现阳性反应。第一轮检测中，爱迪生准确测出阳性反应的比例只有六成五，第二轮检测中，准确测出阳性反应的比例为八成，然而在确效报告中，Theranos却说其梅毒检测有九成五的敏感度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In November 2013, Erika was moved from the immunoassay group to the clinical lab and assigned to Normandy, the room downstairs with the lab's Edison machines. During the Thanksgiving holiday, a patient order came in from the Walgreens store in Palo Alto for a vitamin D test. As she had been trained to do, Erika ran a quality-control check on the Edison devices before testing the patient sample.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quality-control checks are a basic safeguard against inaccurate results and are at the heart of the way laboratories operate. They involve testing a sample of preserved blood plasma that has an already-known concentration of an analyte and seeing if the lab's test for that analyte matches the known value. If the result obtained is two standard deviations higher or lower than the known value, the quality-control check is usually deemed to have failed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Under the protocol Sunny and Daniel had established, the way Theranos generated a result from the Edisons was unorthodox to say the least. First, the little finger-stick samples were diluted with the Tecan liquid handler and split into three parts. Then the three diluted parts were tested on three different Edisons. Each device had two pipette tips that dropped down into the diluted blood, generating two values. So together, the three devices produced six values. The final result was obtained by taking the median of those six values.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="根据桑尼和丹尼尔所创建的方法流程，Theranos用爱迪生取得检测结果的方法并不正统——这是比较好听的说法。首先，先用Tecan自动分注器稀释少少的手指血液样本，再把样本分成三份，将这稀释过的样本分别放进三台爱迪生进行检测，每一台有两个吸量管尖头会插入稀释过的血液里，产生两个数值，所以三台爱迪生总共会产生六个数值，然后取这六个数值的中位数，做为最后结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Following this protocol, Erika had tested two quality-control samples across three devices, generating six values during each run for a total of twelve values.

So, in addition to its one Palo Alto location, the company had just opened two wellness centers in Walgreens stores in the Phoenix area, with plans for several dozen more. Elizabeth planned to open a second lab in Phoenix, but for now the finger-stick samples collected in the Arizona stores were being FedExed back to Palo Alto for testing.

<div class="line_en">In early 2014, Tyler Shultz was moved from the immunoassay group to the production team, which operated downstairs in Normandy. This put him back near Erika and other colleagues from the clinical lab who were processing patient samples on the Edisons and the modified Siemens ADVIAs. There were no physical barriers between the two groups, so Tyler could hear the chatter among the lab associates. Tyler learned from Erika and others that the Edisons were frequently flunking quality-control checks and that Sunny was pressuring lab personnel to ignore the failures and to test patient samples on the devices anyway.</div>

The blood in the nanotainers was often pink, a telltale sign of hemolysis, and the potassium results the diluted samples were producing were consistently too high. Some were so high that the only way they could have been accurate was if the patients were dead. The problem got so bad that Alan implemented a rule that no potassium result above a certain threshold could be released to a patient. He pleaded with Elizabeth to pull the potassium test from the Theranos menu. Instead, she sent Daniel Young to try to fix the assay.</div>

George's second wife, Charlotte, was playing host to the festivities. Elizabeth's parents had flown in for the occasion and her younger brother, Christian, was there too.

Tyler tried to get out of it by invoking work: his shift on the production team was from 3:00 p. m. to 1:00 a. m., overlapping with the evening party. But George insisted.

<div class="line_en">At his grandfather's urging, Tyler played the song he'd hastily composed. He tried not to cringe as he sang its cheesy lyrics, which borrowed from Theranos's "one tiny drop changes everything" slogan. To his horror, he had to play it again a little while later because Henry Kissinger arrived late and everybody thought that he too should hear it. When Tyler was finished, Kissinger, who like George Shultz was in his early nineties, recited a limerick he'd written for the birthday girl. The scene had a surreal quality to it: they were all sitting in a circle in the Shultzes' living room and Elizabeth was in the middle, reveling in the attention. It was as though she were the queen and they were her court, kissing her ring. As awkward as the evening was, it made Tyler feel like he was on friendly enough terms with Elizabeth to speak to her candidly about his concerns. Shortly after the party, he sent her an email asking if they could meet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth invited him to her office. Their meeting was brief, but he had time to raise a few of the issues that bothered him. One of them was the representations Theranos made about the precision of its blood tests: the company claimed that its tests had coefficients of variation of less than 10 percent, but the CVs in many of its validation reports were much higher, he told her. Elizabeth acted surprised and said she didn't think Theranos had made such a claim. She suggested they look at its website together and called it up on her big iMac. A part of the site titled "Our Technology" did prominently advertise a coefficient of variation of less than 10 percent with a catchy green-and-white circular logo, but Elizabeth noted that the smaller print above it specified that the claim only covered Theranos's vitamin D test.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That doesn't sound right," Elizabeth said. She suggested he go speak with Daniel Young. Daniel would be able to walk him through how Theranos performed its data analyses and clear up any confusion. Over the following weeks, Tyler met with Daniel Young twice. Talking to Daniel could be frustrating. He had a long forehead accentuated by a receding hairline that suggested a big, powerful brain. But it was impossible to know what went on inside that brain. His eyes, behind their wire-rim glasses, never betrayed any emotion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler conceded her point and made a mental note to check the vitamin D validation data. He then brought up the fact that his own CV calculations often didn't match those he found in the validation reports. By his count, the percentages in the reports were lower than they should be. In other words, Theranos was exaggerating the precision of its blood tests.</div>

<div class="line_en">The conversation shifted to the syphilis test and what Tyler felt was its overstated sensitivity. Again, Daniel had a ready explanation: some of the Edisons' syphilis results had fallen into an equivocal zone. Results in that zone hadn't been included in the sensitivity calculation. Tyler remained dubious. There didn't seem to be any predefined criteria for this so-called equivocal zone. It could be widened at will until the sensitivity reached whatever number the company wanted. In the case of the syphilis test, it was so wide that more samples had been deemed equivocal than the Edisons had correctly identified as positive. Tyler asked Daniel if he thought Theranos's syphilis test was truly the most accurate syphilis test on the market, as the company claimed. Daniel replied that Theranos had never claimed to have the most accurate tests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着话题转到梅毒检验，泰勒觉得那项检验的敏感度被夸大了，丹尼尔对此也有预先准备好的说词，他平静地解释，爱迪生的梅毒检测有一些落在「不确定区间」（equivocal zone），落在那个区间的结果并没有纳入敏感度的计算。泰勒对此仍然存疑。何谓「不确定区间」似乎没有预先明确定义，所以可以任意扩大，直到获得想要的敏感度数字为止。以梅毒检测来说，「不确定区间」的范围就很宽，所以爱迪生做出的检测结果落在「不确定区间」者，多过正确验出阳性反应者。泰勒问丹尼尔，是不是真的认同公司所宣称「Theranos的梅毒检测是市场上最准确」，丹尼尔回答公司从未宣称自己的检测最准确。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Daniel may have technically been correct, but Tyler had put his finger on a central weakness of the Edison device: its pipette tips were terribly imprecise. Generating six measurements during each test and then selecting the median was a way to correct for that imprecision. If the tips had been reliable in the first place, there would have been no need for such contortions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就技术上来说，丹尼尔的说法或许没错，但是泰勒直指问题核心是出在爱迪生的一大缺点：吸量管尖头的精准度太差。之所以需要每次检测都产生六个结果，再从中挑出中位数，就是为了弥补吸量管尖头精准度太差的问题，如果吸量管尖头一开始就是准确的，就不需要搞得这么复杂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something else that was bothering Tyler -- something he'd just gotten wind of from Erika -- and he decided to bring that up too. All clinical laboratories must submit three times a year to something called "proficiency testing," an exercise designed to ferret out labs whose testing isn't accurate. Accredited bodies like the College of American Pathologists send laboratories samples of preserved blood plasma and ask them to test them for various analytes.</div>

<div class="line_en">After Tyler got back to his desk, he googled the two recent articles that had been published in the press about Theranos and emailed them to Daniel. One of them was Elizabeth's Wall Street Journal interview, which stated that Theranos's tests were "more accurate than the conventional methods" and called that improved accuracy a scientific advance. When they met again a few days later, Daniel allowed that the statements in the Journal piece were too sweeping but argued that they had been made by the writer, not by Elizabeth herself. Tyler found this argument a little too convenient. Surely the writer hadn't made up these claims on his own; he must have heard them from Elizabeth. A faint smile briefly crossed Daniel's lips.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler didn't hear anything back for several days. When the response finally arrived, it didn't come from Elizabeth. It came from Sunny. And it was withering. In a point-by-point rebuttal that was longer than Tyler's original email, Sunny belittled everything from his grasp of statistics to his knowledge of laboratory science. The overall message was that Tyler was too junior and green to understand what he was talking about. Sunny's tone throughout was dripping with venom, but he reserved his sharpest words for the questions Tyler had raised about proficiency testing:</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, that very afternoon, at about the same time Tyler had gotten his mother's frantic call, Sunny had summoned her to his office. He had gone through Tyler's emails and figured out that Erika was the one who had sent him the proficiency-testing results. Their conversation had started out cordially enough, but Sunny had berated her when she'd brought up the quality-control failures in the lab.
