<div class="line_en">Making it worse was his own amateur status as a winter driver. It scared him to have the yellow center line buried under swirling, drifting snow, and it scared him when the heavy gusts of wind came unimpeded through the notches in the hills and actually made the heavy Buick slew around. It scared him that the road information signs were mostly masked with snow and you could flip a coin as to whether the road was going to break right or left up ahead in the white drive-in movie screen he seemed to be driving through. He was scared, all right. He had driven in a cold sweat since climbing into the hills west of Boulder and Lyons, handling the accelerator and brake as if they were Ming vases. Between rock 'n' roll tunes on the radio, the disc jockey constantly adjured motorists to stay off the main highways and under no conditions to go into the mountains, because many roads were impassable and all of them were dangerous. Scores of minor accidents had been reported, and two serious ones: a party of skiers in a VW microbus and a family that had been bound for Albuquerque through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The combined score on both was four dead and five wounded. "So stay off those roads and get into the good music here at KTLK," the jock concluded cheerily, and then compounded Hallorann's misery by playing "Seasons in the Sun." "We had joy, we had fun, we had --" Terry Jacks gibbered happily, and Hallorann snapped the radio off viciously, knowing he would have it back on in five minutes. No matter how bad it was, it was better than riding alone through this white madness.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quarter of two in the afternoon and according to the snow-clotted signs and the Hertz Buick's odometer, he was less than three miles from Estes Park when he finally went off the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the hills, the snow was falling faster and more furiously than Hallorann had ever seen (which was, perhaps, not to say a great deal, since Hallorann had seen as little snow as he could manage in his lifetime), and the wind was blowing a capricious gale -- now from the west, now backing around to the north, sending clouds of powdery snow across his field of vision, making him coldly aware again and again that if he missed a turn he might well plunge two hundred feet off the road, the Electra cartwheeling ass over teapot as it went down.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind gusted again, this time from the northeast, a little English on the ball if you please, and he was again cut off from the vague shapes of the hills and even from the embankments on either side of the road. He was driving through white null.</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't even funny. He would have backed off before he even cleared Boulder if it hadn't been for his compulsion that the boy was in terrible trouble. Even now a small voice in the back of his skull -- more the voice of reason than of cowardice, he thought -- was telling him to hole up in an Estes Park motel for the night and wait for the plows to at least expose the center stripe again. That voice kept reminding him of the jet's shaky landing at Stapleton, of that sinking feeling that it was going to come in nose-first, delivering its passengers to the gates of hell rather than at Gate 39, Concourse B. But reason would not stand against the compulsion. It had to be today. The snowstorm was his own bad luck. He would have to cope with it. He was afraid that if he didn't, he might have something much worse to cope with in his dreams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这绝不是什么乐事儿。要不是因为他强烈地感到那孩子处境险恶，到达博尔德之前他就会开回去了。即便现在，他后脑勺里也有一个小小的声音——他想，与其说是怯懦的声音，还不如说是理智的声音——告诉他在伊斯蒂丝帕克找一家汽车旅馆过一夜，至少等铲雪车铲出路中间的黄线。这个声音不停地提醒他斯泰普尔机场那次颠簸的着陆，并使他想起飞机就要一跟头把乘客送入地狱之门而不是机场B大厅的39门时的那种下沉感。但是，急迫的感情战胜了理智，必须今天赶到。遇上暴风雪是他自己运气不好，他必须把它对付过去。他担心，如果他不这样做，他将在梦里遇到可怕得多的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the high sodium lights of the snowplow loomed out of the soup, bearing down, and to his horror he saw that instead of being to one side, the Buick's nose was pointed directly between those headlamps. The plow was being none too choosy about keeping its own side of the road, and Hallorann had allowed the Buick to drift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，铲雪车高高的钠灯隐隐穿透这一锅粥似的东西向他逼来了。令他大惊失色的是，他发现别克车车头没有错开，而是直接指着铲雪车前灯中间。铲雪车倒并非那么挑剔偏要呆在它自己那一边，于是，哈洛伦只好让别克车听天由命了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Color was materializing out of the white now, snow-clotted orange. He could see the high cab, even the gesticulating figure of the driver behind the single long wiper blade.

<div class="line_cn" title="一片白色之中呈现出一抹橙黄。他能看见高高的司机室，甚至能看见长长的单臂刮雪器后面打着手势的司机，能看见铲雪车“V”字形的翼犁在向左边的路堤倾泻着像白色的废气一样的雪粉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He squeezed the accelerator like the breast of a much loved woman and the Buick scooted forward and toward the right. There was no embankment over here; the plows headed up instead of down had only to push the snow directly over the drop.</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned around and saw the plow forty yards further down the road, obscured in the blowing snow except for the raftered dark brown streak of its exhaust and the revolving blue lights on top. The driver was standing just behind him, dressed in a long sheepskin coat and a slicker over it. A blue-and-white pinstriped engineer's cap was perched on his head, and Hallorann could hardly believe it was staying on in the teeth of the wind.</div>

Hallorann got going again, the chains flailing at the snowcover on the road, finally digging in enough to start the Buick moving.

And meeting two people with the shine in one day (when he usually didn't run across more than four or five in the course of a year) might not mean anything. That feeling of finality, a feeling (like things are all wrapped up) he could not completely define was still very much with him.

<div class="line_en">He did make it to Sidewinder, although he was four and a half hours on the road between Estes Park and there. By the time he got to the Upland Highway it was full dark, but the snowstorm showed no sign of abating. Twice he'd had to stop in front of drifts that were as high as his car's hood and wait for the plows to come along and knock holes in them. At one of the drifts the plow had come up on his side of the road and there had been another close call. The driver had merely swung around his car, not getting out to chew the fat, but he did deliver one of the two finger gestures that all Americans above the age of ten recognize, and it was not the peace sign.</div>
