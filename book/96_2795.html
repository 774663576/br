<div class="line_en">"I can do that," said Howl. "I thought I showed you. I can also make you a pair of seven-league boots of your own if you give me you size. Something practical in brown calf, perhaps. It's amazing the way one can take a step ten and half miles long and still always land in a cow pat."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have an instinct, Sophie, that's how," said howl. ""Nothing is safe from you. If I were to court a girl who lived on an iceberg in the middle of an ocean, sooner or later -- probably sooner -- I'd look up to see you swooping overhead on a broomstick. In fact, by now I'd be disappointed in you if I didn't see you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“苏菲、那是因为你拥有知觉，所以会这样。”哈尔说：“好象没有事情能逃得过你。如果我去追求一个住在海中央浮冰上的女孩，迟早，搞不好很早，我抬头一看，就会看到你骑着扫把在上头俯冲。事实上，如果我没看到你的话，只怕我会很失望啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mrs. Fairfax is a family friend," said Sophie. "How as I to know you would be there too?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie was not sure she believed a word of this, though it was certainly to Kingsbury, with the doorknob red-down, that Howl departed after breakfast, waving Michael aside when Michael tried to consult him about the perplexing spell. Michael, since he had nothing else to do, left too. He said he might as well go to Cesari's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说的话苏菲一句也不相信。不过门柄红色朝下，他确实是要去金斯别利。哈尔用过早餐即离开，麦可想问他那个另人困扰的咒语的事，他却挥手叫他走开。这么一来，麦可也没事干，所以他也出门去了，他说他要去希赛利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You wrong me, Sophie," Howl said. He sounded deeply injured. Sophie looked suspiciously sideways. Beyond the red jewel swinging in Howl's ear, his profile looked sad and noble. "Long years will pass before I leave Lettie," he said. "And in fact I'm off to see the King again today. Satisfied, Mrs. Nose?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你误会我了，苏菲。”哈尔说。声音听起来非常受伤。苏菲怀疑地把眼睛转开。红色的耳环在哈尔耳上晃呀晃的，但他整个人看来很高尚，带着些许悲伤。“我要很久很久才会跟乐蒂分开。”他说：“事实上，我今天得再度去面见国王。满意了吧？长鼻子太太。”【注：长鼻子意指多管闲事。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll see," said Sophie. She hobbled over to the grate. "What shall I do?" she whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我看看，”苏菲说着，回头走到壁炉边，低声问道：“我该怎么做？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“避难港啦。”卡西法告诉她，对她闪过一个紫色的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yellow powder, fourth jar along on the second shelf," Calcifer whispered back. "Those spells are mostly belief. Don't look uncertain when you give it to him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黄色粉末，第二个架子的第四个罐子。”卡西法悄声告诉她：“那些咒语的主要成分是‘相信’，所以东西给人时要看起来很有信心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Sophie poured yellow powder into a square of paper as she had seen Michael do, twisted it smartly, and hobbled to the door with it. "There you are, my boy," she said. "That'll stick the shoes on harder than any hundred nails. Do you hear me, horse? You won't need a smith for the next year. That'll be a penny, thank you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲将粉末倒一些在一片方形纸上，像她看麦可做的那样，漂亮地扭一下，带着它拐回门边。“拿这个去，孩子。”她说：“这会把蹄铁黏得比用一百根铁钉钉得还牢。听到了没，马儿？接下来一整年你都不需要用到铁匠那哩。总共是一分钱，谢谢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie was left alone. She still did not truly believe what Howl had said about Lettie, but she had been wrong about him before, and she had only Michael and Calcifer's word for Howl's behavior, after all. She collected up all the little blue triangles of cloth and began guiltily sewing them back into the silver fishing net which was all that was left of the suit. When someone knocked at the door, she started violently, thinking it was the scarecrow again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲被独自一人丢在家里，她仍然无法真正相信哈尔所说的关于乐蒂的事，不过她也不是没有误会过他，而且，她一直都只靠着卡西法和麦可的话来评估哈尔的行为。她将所有的小蓝色三角形收集起来，开始怀着罪恶感地，将它们缝回那件剩下部分看起来像一面银色鱼网的衣服上。当有人来敲门时，她吓了一大跳，以为稻草人又回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That should be all right, then. Sophie hobbled over and opened it, blue-down. There was a cart horse outside. The young fellow of fifty who was leading it wondered if Mrs. Witch had something which might stop it casting shoes all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那应该没问题了。苏菲拐着腿走过去，蓝色向下，打开门来。外头停着一匹专用来拖车的马。牵着它的，是一个五十岁左右的年轻人，他问巫婆太太有没有什么方法可以让马不要一年到头掉蹄铁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quite a busy day. Sophie had to put down her sewing and sell, with Calcifer's help, a spell to unblock drains, another to fetch goats, and something to make good beer. The only one that gave her any trouble was the customer who pounded on the door in Kingsbury. Sophie opened it red-down to find a richly dressed boy not much older than Michael, white-faced and sweating, wringing his hands on the doorstep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是个非常忙碌的一天。苏菲必须一再放下手头缝制的工作去卖东西，靠着卡西法的帮忙，她卖出一个通水管的咒语、一个抓山羊的，还有制造好啤酒的。唯一令她头疼的，是一个来自金斯别利的客户。苏菲将门把转到红色向下打开，看到一位服装考究、年纪比麦可大不了多少的男孩，脸色苍白、冒着冷汗，拧着双手站在门前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Madam Sorceress, for pity's sake!" he said. "I have to fight a duel at dawn tomorrow. Give me something to make sure I win. I'll pay any sum you ask!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那就给我一个能让我有公平机会的咒语。”那少年绝望地恳求。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie looked over her shoulder at Calcifer, and Calcifer made faces back, meaning that there was no such thing ready-made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲回头看着卡西法，卡西法对她扮了一下鬼脸，意思是说现成品里没有那样的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That wouldn't be right at all," Sophie told the boy severely. "Besides, dueling is wrong."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样是不对的。”苏菲严厉地说：“而且，决斗是不应该的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie looked at him. He was very undersized and clearly in a great state of ear. He had that hopeless look a person has who always loses at everything. "I'll see what I can do," Sophie said. She hobbled over to the shelves and scanned the jars. The red one labeled CAYENNE looked the most likely. Sophie poured a generous heap of it on a square of paper. She stood the human skull beside it. "Because you must know more about this than I do," she muttered at it. The young man was leaning anxiously round the door to watch. Sophie took up a knife and made what she hoped would look like mystic passes over the heap of pepper. "You are to make a fair fight," she mumbled. "A fair fight! Understand?" She screwed the paper up and hobbled to the door with it. "Throw this in the air when the duel starts," she told the undersized young man, "and it will give you the same chance as the other man. After that, whether you win or not depends on you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲看着他。他个子很小，很明显地性格怯懦，他脸上有一种‘永远的输家’那种无助的表情。“我尽量试看看。”苏菲说。她拐着脚来到架子前面，审视那些瓶瓶罐罐，一个上标有‘辣椒’的红色罐子看来最合适。她倒了一大堆到方形纸上，然后将骷髅放到它旁边。“我想决斗这种事，你应该比我清楚。”她对着骷髅喃喃自语，口中同时念叨着：“要公平地打斗！知道吗？”她把纸包起来，扭好，蹒跚地走回门边。“决斗一开始，就把这个撒向空中。”她跟小个子年轻人说：“它会带给你和对方相同的机会。在那之后，输赢都要靠你自己了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The undersized young man was so grateful that he tried to give her a gold piece. Sophie refused to take it, so he gave her a two-penny bit instead and went away, whistling happily. "I feel a fraud," Sophie said as she stowed the money under the hearthstone. "Nut I would like to be there at that fight!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小个儿年轻人显然非常感激，要塞给她一个金币，但是苏菲拒绝接受，所以他只好给她两辩士，然后高高兴兴地吹着口哨离开。“我觉得自己像个骗子。”苏菲边把钱藏到壁炉石块下边说：“但是我真希望决斗时我能在场。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael breezed in toward the end of the afternoon. He took an anxious look round to make sure Howl had not come home first and went to the bench, where he got things out to make it look as if he had been busy, singing cheerfully while he did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近傍晚时麦可飞了进来，进门后他先紧张地四处张望了一下，确定哈尔还没回来。接着走到工作台，将东西拿出来，让台子看起来好象他在那里忙了一天的样子，边弄边愉快地唱着歌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I envy you being able to walk all that way so easily," Sophie said, sewing a blue triangle to silver braid. "How was Ma -- my niece?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Howl backed into the door to shut it and leaned there in a tragic attitude. "Look at you all!" he said. "Ruin stares me in the face. I slave all day for you all. And not one of you, even Calcifer, can spare time to say hello!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔往后退，以背部将门关上，背靠着门一副很悲怆的样子。“看看你们！”他说：“应该这样对待我的吗？我整天为你们做牛做马。可是你们，连卡西法也一样，连跟我说声hello的时间都没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's better," said Howl. "Some of you are pretending to notice me at last. How kind of you to ask, Sophie. Yes, something is wrong.

<div class="line_cn" title="麦可拿到的是一件崭新漂亮的丝绒外套。他满口抱怨，一点也没有感激的样子。“你一定把丝质皮包里的钱全部用光了！我不需要这个。你自己才需要新衣服！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mystified, Sophie unwrapped things: several pairs of silk stockings; two parcels of the finests cambric petticoats, with flounces, lace, and satin insets; a pair of elastic-sided boots in dove-gray suede; a lace shawl; and a dress of gray watered silk trimmed with lace that matched the shawl. Sophie took one professional look at each and gasped. The lace alone was worth a fortune. She stroked the silk of the dress, awed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲困惑地将包裹一一解开，里头有几双丝质长袜，两包白麻布衬裙，下摆饰有荷叶边、蕾丝和缎带，一双灰鸽色软皮，侧边有松紧带的靴子，一件蕾丝披肩，还有一件水洗丝制成的灰色洋装，上面蕾丝的颜色与披肩正好相配。苏菲以专业者的眼光一一审视，一次次地惊叹出声，光是那件蕾丝披肩就价值不菲了。她抚抚摩着洋装的丝料，露出敬畏的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl hooked his boot into what remained of the blue-and-silver suit and held it up ruefully. Sophie had been working hard, but it was still more hole than suit.

<div class="line_en">Michael looked at Sophie imploringly. Sophie glowered. She saw well enough that the happiness of both her sisters depended on her agreeing to see the King. With green slime in reserve. "You haven't asked me to do anything yet," she said. "You've just said I'm going to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦可恳求地望着苏菲，苏菲忍不住要呻吟。她清楚地看到，两个妹妹的幸福都系于她去见国王这件事上头，何况背后还有绿色黏液的威胁。“你还没开口拜托我呢！”她说：“你只是说我会去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What ingratitude!" Howl exclaimed, spreading out both arms. "Let's have green slime again! After which I shall be forced to move the castle a thousand miles away and never see my lovely Lettie again!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tomorrow afternoon," said Howl. "Michael can go as your footman. The King's expecting you." He sat on the stool and began explaining very clearly and soberly just what Sophie was to say. There was no trace of the green-slime mood, now things were going Howl's way, Sophie noticed. She wanted to slap him. "I want you to do a very delicate job," Howl explained, "so that the King will go on giving me work like the transport spells, but not trust me with anything like finding his brother. You must tell him how I've angered the Witch of the Waste and explain what a good son I am to you, but I want you to do it in such a way that he'll understand I'm really quite useless."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“明天下午。”哈尔说：“麦可可以当你的仆役。国王会等着接见你。”他在凳子上坐下，开始冷静、清晰地解释，告诉苏菲该说些什么。因为事情完全顺他的意，他不再有半点‘绿黏液情绪’，苏菲很想甩他耳光。“我要你做的是很敏感、不易处理的事。”哈尔解释道：“我要国王能够继续雇佣我做类似运输咒那样的工作，但又不够信任到足以把诸如寻找他弟弟之类的工作交托给我。你得告诉他我得罪荒地女巫的原因，同时告诉他我仍是一个好儿子，对你很孝顺，但是说的时候要有技巧，让他觉得我这个人实在没用。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And it occurred to me, Sophie, that you might want some practice in order not to find the Palace overwhelming. We don't want you coming over queer in the middle of the interview. Not yet, Michael. So I arranged for you to pay a call to my old tutor, Mrs. Pentstemmon. She's a grand old thing. In some ways she's grander than the King. So you'll be quite used to that kind of thing by the time you get to the Palace."</div>

<div class="line_en">Howl leaped up and sorted among the things on the bench. "Sophie strikes again," he said. Things skidded right and left as he searched. "I might have known! No, the proper spell's not here." He tapped the skull thoughtfully on its brown, shiny dome. "Your doing, friend? I have a notion you come from there. I'm sure the guitar does.
