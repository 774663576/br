<div class="line_en">She was an old cog, and even in her youth no one had ever called her pretty. Her figurehead showed a laughing woman holding an infant by one foot, but the woman's cheeks and the babe's bottom were both pocked by wormholes. Uncounted layers of drab brown paint covered her hull; her sails were grey and tattered. She was not a ship to draw a second glance, unless it was to wonder how she stayed afloat. The Merry Midwife was known in White Harbor too. For years she had plied a humble trade between there and Sisterton.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not the sort of arrival that Davos Seaworth had anticipated when he'd set sail with Salla and his fleet. All this had seemed simpler then. The ravens had not brought King Stannis the allegiance of White Harbor, so His Grace would send an envoy to treat with Lord Manderly in person. As a show of strength, Davos would arrive aboard Salla's galleas Valyrian, with the rest of the Lysene fleet behind her. Every hull was striped: black and yellow, pink and blue, green and white, purple and gold. The Lyseni loved bright hues, and Salladhor Saan was the most colorful of all. Salladhor the Splendid, Davos thought, but the storms wrote an end to all of that.</div>

<div class="line_en">White Harbor's walls of whitewashed stone rose before them, on the eastern shore where the White Knife plunged into the firth. Some of the city's defenses had been strengthened since the last time Davos had been here, half a dozen years before. The jetty that divided the inner and outer harbors had been fortified with a long stone wall, thirty feet tall and almost a mile long, with towers every hundred yards. There was smoke rising from Seal Rock as well, where once there had been only ruins. That could be good or bad, depending on what side Lord Wyman chooses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白港的白色石墙耸立在他们面前，东岸白刃河直插入河口湾。城市的防御工事与戴佛斯上次来相比有了明显加强，那是在六年前。分成内港和外港的码头又加固了一道长石墙，高三十尺，长差不多一里，每间隔一百码都有塔楼。海豹岩也有烟冒出来，以前那里只是废墟。这可能是好事也可能是坏事，取决于文曼大人站在谁的一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davos had always been fond of this city, since first he'd come here as a cabin boy on Cobblecat. Though small compared to Oldtown and King's Landing, it was clean and well-ordered, with wide straight cobbled streets that made it easy for a man to find his way. The houses were built of whitewashed stone, with steeply pitched roofs of dark grey slate. Roro Uhoris, the Cobblecat's cranky old master, used to claim that he could tell one port from another just by the way they smelled. Cities were like women, he insisted; each one had its own unique scent. Oldtown was as flowery as a perfumed dowager. Lannisport was a milkmaid, fresh and earthy, with woodsmoke in her hair. King's Landing reeked like some unwashed whore. But White Harbor's scent was sharp and salty, and a little fishy too. "She smells the way a mermaid ought to smell," Roro said. "She smells of the sea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯一直喜欢这个城市，自从他作为Cobblecat号上船舱服务生第一次来到白港。尽管白港比旧镇和君临要小，但它更干净、有序，又宽又直的鹅卵石街道不会让人迷路。房屋都是白色石头建造，黑灰色石板铺成陡斜坡屋顶。Roro Uhoris，Cobblecat号上的古怪老船长，曾声称凭气味就能分辨出各个港口。城市就像女人，他坚持认为，每一个都有自己独一无二的气味。旧镇是绚丽的带香味的贵妇；兰尼斯港是头发里有烟熏味的挤奶女仆，鲜嫩简朴；君临臭的像从不洗澡的妓女；而白港的气味像小渔家女，又咸又辣。“她闻起来像美人鱼，”Roro说，“有海的味道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She still does, thought Davos, but he could smell the peat smoke drifting off Seal Rock too. The sea stone dominated the approaches to the outer harbor, a massive grey-green upthrust looming fifty feet above the waters. Its top was crowned with a circle of weathered stones, a ringfort of the First Men that had stood desolate and abandoned for hundreds of years. It was not abandoned now. Davos could see scorpions and spitfires behind the standing stones, and crossbowmen peering between them. It must be cold up there, and wet. On all his previous visits, seals could be seen basking on the broken rocks below. The Blind Bastard always made him count them whenever the Cobblecat set sail from White Harbor; the more seals there were, Roro said, the more luck they would have on their voyage. There were no seals now. The smoke and the soldiers had frightened them away. A wiser man would see a caution in that. If I had a thimble full of sense, I would have gone with Salla. He could have made his way back south, to Marya and their sons. I have lost four sons in the king's service, and my fifth serves as his squire. I should have the right to cherish the two boys who still remain. It has been too long since I saw them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她依然如此，戴佛斯想，但是他也能闻到从海豹岩渐渐飘远的泥煤烟味。那块海石耸立在外港入口处，巨大的灰绿色石体冲出水面五十尺高，顶上戴着一圈风化石头的‘冠冕’，孤立和被遗弃了数百年的先民的环形堡垒。但现在没有被遗弃，戴佛斯能看到直立巨石后面的scorpions和spitfires，十字弓手们在它们之间窥视着，站在那里肯定又冷又湿。以前每次来这里，都能看到海豹躺在破碎的岩石下面晒太阳，每次Cobblecat从白港起航前，‘瞎眼私生子’总是让他数它们。“海豹越多，”Roro说，“我们的航程就越有好运气。”现在没有一只海豹，烟和士兵们吓跑了它们。聪明点儿的人会因此而多加小心。如果当时我有这种感觉，我会驾驶‘赛垃’号离开。他本该改道回南方见Marya和他的儿子们。我为了给国王服务已经失去了四个儿子，第五个儿子是国王的侍从。我应该有珍惜还活着的两个儿子的权利。我已经太长时间没见到他们了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At Eastwatch, the black brothers told him there was no love between the Manderlys of White Harbor and the Boltons of the Dreadfort. The Iron Throne had raised Roose Bolton up to Warden of the North, so it stood to reason that Wyman Manderly should declare for Stannis. White Harbor cannot stand alone. The city needs an ally, a protector. Lord Wyman needs King Stannis as much as Stannis needs him. Or so it seemed at Eastwatch.</div>

<div class="line_en">That jetty wall conceals the inner harbor, he realized, as the Merry Midwife was pulling down her sail. The outer harbor was larger, but the inner harbor offered better anchorage, sheltered by the city wall on one side and the looming mass of the Wolf's Den on another, and now by the jetty wall as well. At Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, Cotter Pyke told Davos that Lord Wyman was building war galleys. There could have been a score of ships concealed behind those walls, waiting only a command to put to sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sisterton had undermined those hopes. If Lord Borrell told it true, if the Manderlys meant to join their strength to the Boltons and the Freys… no, he would not dwell on that. He would know the truth soon enough. He prayed he had not come too late.</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind the city's thick white walls, the New Castle rose proud and pale upon its hill. Davos could see the domed roof of the Sept of the Snows as well, surmounted by tall statues of the Seven. The Manderlys had brought the Faith north with them when they were driven from the Reach. White Harbor had its godswood too, a brooding tangle of root and branch and stone locked away behind the crumbling black walls of the Wolf's Den, an ancient fortress that served only as a prison now. But for the most part the septons ruled here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厚厚的白石城墙后面，新城堡挺立在山岗上，骄傲而苍白。戴佛斯也能看到雪诺家族的穹形屋顶，上面站立着七神的高大雕像。曼德勒家族带着北方的神，从‘the Reach’迁来白港。白港也有自己的神木林，如今只是关在狼舍破碎的黑墙后面的一堆乱糟糟的树根、树枝和石头，古老的要塞被用作监狱。不过大多数时候是修士们管理这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The merman of House Manderly was everywhere in evidence, flying from the towers of the New Castle, above the Seal Gate, and along the city walls.

<div class="line_en">The Merry Midwife tied up to the end of a weathered wooden pier in the outer harbor, well away from Lionstar. As her crew made her fast to the pilings and lowered a gangplank, her captain sauntered up to Davos. Casso Mogat was a mongrel of the narrow sea, fathered on a Sisterton whore by an Ibbenese whaler. Only five feet tall and very hirsute, he dyed his hair and whiskers a mossy green. It made him look like a tree stump in yellow boots. Despite his appearance, he seemed a good sailor, though a hard master to his crew. "How long will you be gone?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“接生婆梅丽”号系在外港风化的木头水上平台的最远端，很好地远离兰尼斯特的船。当船员们快速的打好桩放下跳板，船长漫步到戴佛斯面前。Casso Mogat是来自狭海的杂种，出身是伊班的捕鲸人在姐妹群岛上了一个妓女。他只有五尺身高，浑身长毛，头发胡子染成苔藓绿色，这让他看起来像是长在黄靴子上的一节树桩。虽然其貌不扬，但他是个好水手，尽管对船员们过于严苛了点儿。“你要去多长时间？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sight of her sent a knife through his hopes. Her hull was black and gold, her figurehead a lion with an upraised paw. Lionstar, read the letters on her stern, beneath a fluttering banner that bore the arms of the boy king on the Iron Throne. A year ago, he would not have been able to read them, but Maester Pylos had taught him some of the letters back on Drag-onstone. For once, the reading gave him little pleasure. Davos had been praying that the galley had been lost in the same storms that had ravaged Salla's fleet, but the gods had not been so kind. The Freys were here, and he would need to face them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼前所见像一把刀击碎了他所有希望。那艘战船黑金色船壳，船头雕饰是一头高举单爪的狮子。她的船尾字母是——兰尼斯特，飘扬的旗帜下面是铁王座上男孩国王的军队。一年前他还不认识字，但是每当他回到龙石岛派洛斯学士就教他一些字母。然而这一次，识字没带给他什么乐趣。戴佛斯曾经祈祷摧毁‘塞拉’号的船队的那场风暴也摧毁兰尼斯特的战舰，然而诸神不够仁慈。佛雷家的船也在这儿，他需要去面对他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A pair of customs men were clambering aboard as he went down the gangplank, but neither gave him so much as a glance. They were there to see the captain and inspect the hold; common seamen did not concern them, and few men looked as common as Davos. He was of middling height, his shrewd peasant's face weathered by wind and sun, his grizzled beard and brown hair well salted with grey. His garb was plain as well: old boots, brown breeches and blue tunic, a woolen mantle of undyed wool, fastened with a wooden clasp. He wore a pair of salt-stained leather gloves to hide the stubby fingers of the hand that Stannis had shortened, so many years ago. Davos hardly looked a lord, much less a King's Hand.

Behind one stack he glimpsed three sailors throwing dice. Farther on the fishwives were crying the day's catch, and a boy was beating time on a drum as a shabby old bear danced in a circle for a ring of river runners. Two spearmen had been posted at the Seal Gate, with the badge of House Manderly upon their breasts, but they were too intent on flirting with a dockside whore to pay Davos any mind.

Beneath the arches of the peddler's colonnade the scribes and money changers had set up for business, along with a hedge wizard, an herb woman, and a very bad juggler. A man was selling apples from a barrow, and a woman was offering herring with chopped onions. Chickens and children were everywhere underfoot. The huge oak-and-iron doors of the Old Mint had always been closed when Davos had been in Fishfoot Yard before, but today they stood open.

He made his way around Old Fishfoot, past where a young girl was selling cups of fresh milk from her nanny goat. He was remembering more of the city now that he was here. Down past where Old Fishfoot's trident pointed was an alley where they sold fried cod, crisp and golden brown outside and flaky white within. Over there was a brothel, cleaner than most, where a sailor could enjoy a woman without fear of being robbed or killed. Off the other way, in one of those houses that clung to the walls of the Wolf's Den like barnacles to an old hull, there used to be a brewhouse where they made a black beer so thick and tasty that a cask of it could fetch as much as Arbor gold in Braavos and the Port of Ibben, provided the locals left the brewer any to sell.</div>

He strolled across the yard and down a flight of steps, to a winesink called the Lazy Eel, underneath a warehouse full of sheepskins. Back in his smuggling days, the Eel had been renowned for offering the oldest whores and vilest wine in White Harbor, along with meat pies full of lard and gristle that were inedible on their best days and poisonous on their worst. With fare like that, most locals shunned the place, leaving it for sailors who did not know any better. You never saw a city guardsman down in the Lazy Eel, or a customs officer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before long, he found himself staring at the hearth. The red woman could see the future in the fire, but all that Davos Seaworth ever saw were the shadows of the past: the burning ships, the fiery chain, the green shadows flashing across the belly of the clouds, the Red Keep brooding over all. Davos was a simple man, raised up by chance and war and Stannis. He did not understand why the gods would take four lads as young and strong as his sons, yet spare their weary father. Some nights he thought he had been left to rescue Edric Storm… but by now King Robert's bastard boy was safe in the Stepstones, yet Davos still remained. Do the gods have some other task for me? he wondered. If so, White Harbor may be some part of it. He tried the wine, then poured half his cup onto the floor beside his foot.</div>

This prince liked to dress the creature in his dead son's clothes and pretend he was a child, Ser Axell claimed, and from time to time he would propose marriages for him. The lords so honored always declined politely, but of course they did decline. "Even dressed in silk and velvet, an ape remains an ape," Ser Axell said. "A wiser prince would have known that you cannot send an ape to do a man's work." The queen's men laughed, and several grinned at Davos. I am no ape, he'd thought. I am as much a lord as you, and a better man. But the memory still stung.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="舰队起航前的夜晚，赛丽丝皇后曾经宴请‘塞拉’船队和它的船长们。科特？派克也加入了他们，还有其他四位守夜人的高官，希琳公主也被允许参加。当鲑鱼端上来时，作为娱乐，Axell Florent爵士讲述了把猿猴当作宠物的坦格利安幼年王子的故事。这个王子喜欢给那个猿猴穿上他死去儿子的衣服装扮成小孩，Axell爵士宣称，久而久之他甚至提出要和那猴子结婚。大人们总是放不下自尊，但是那次他们放下来了。“他甚至给它穿丝绸和天鹅绒，猴子就是猴子，”Axell爵士说，“一个聪明的王子应该知道，你不能让一个猴子去做人的事情。”后党的人大笑，也有些人对着戴佛斯咧嘴笑。我不是猴子，他当时想，我和你一样是领主，而且是比你更好的人。但是这段记忆仍然让他刺痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were other places he might get his ears filled: an inn famous for its lamprey pies, the alehouse where the wool factors and the customs men did their drinking, a mummer's hall where bawdy entertainments could be had for a few pennies. But Davos felt that he had heard enough. I've come too late. Old instinct made him reach for his chest, where once he'd kept his fingerbones in a little sack on a leather thong. There was nothing there. He had lost his luck in the fires of the Blackwater, when he'd lost his ship and sons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里也有其他地方传来的声音充斥着他的耳朵：一家七鳃鳗派著称的旅店，一家酒馆里羊毛商和海关官员们正在对饮，一个伶人的大厅正在进行着几个便士就可以观看的下流表演。戴佛斯觉得他听到的消息已经够多，但是我来的太晚了，以前的本能让他又摸向自己的胸口，那里曾经挂着保存他的指节的小皮袋。什么也没有。自从他在黑水河的大火里失去他的船和儿子，他也失去了自己的运气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Castle Stair was a street with steps, a broad white stone way that led up from the Wolf's Den by the water to the New Castle on its hill. Marble mermaids lit the way as Davos climbed, bowls of burning whale oil cradled in their arms. When he reached the top, he turned to look behind him. From here he could see down into the harbors. Both of them. Behind the jetty wall, the inner harbor was crowded with war galleys. Davos counted twenty-three. Lord Wyman was a fat man, but not an idle one, it seemed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城堡楼梯是带台阶的街道，一条宽阔的白石路从水边的‘狼舍’连接了小山上的新城堡。‘大理石美人鱼’照亮了戴佛斯爬升的路，燃烧着的海豹油碗托在它们的臂弯里。爬到路的顶端，他转身看他身后，从这里他能看到海港，外港和内港。防护墙后面，内港里挤满了战船，戴佛斯数到了二十三。文曼大人是一个胖人，不过，他似乎不是一个游手好闲的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gates of the New Castle had been closed, but a postern opened when he shouted, and a guard emerged to ask his business. Davos showed him the black and gold ribbon that bore the royal seals. "I need to see Lord Manderly at once," he said. "My business is with him, and him alone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新城堡的正门已经关闭，但是当他大喊开门之后，一扇后门打开了，一个护卫出来问他有什么事。戴佛斯把黑金色的缎带给他，上面有国王的印章。“我需要马上见到曼德勒大人，”他说，“我有事和他谈，单独谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Seal Gate had been closed for the night. Davos would not be able to return to the Merry Midwife till dawn. He was here for the night. He gazed up at Old Fishfoot with his broken trident. I have come through rain and wrack and storm. I will not go back without doing what I came for, no matter how hopeless it may seem. He might have lost his fingers and his luck, but he was no ape in velvet. He was a King's Hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海豹门因为夜晚已经关闭了，戴佛斯无法再回到“接生婆梅拉”号，直到天亮以前，他要在这儿过夜，他盯着拿着残破三叉戟的‘老鱼脚’。我经历大雨、沉船、风暴才来到这里，不做完我要做的事我不能回去，无论事情看起来多么无望。他失去了他的手指和运气，但是他不是穿天鹅绒的猴子，他是国王之手。">查看中文翻译</div>
