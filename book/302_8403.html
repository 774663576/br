<div class="line_en">The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighedfor the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that ifany place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardlyless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less benton its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of thedifficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be broughtto acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughtstowards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes totheir kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of hergood-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them fromhome yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much moreeligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland aboutthe end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with bothher friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go withthem. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacyof Miss Dashwood; -- but it was inforced with so much real politeness byMr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of hismanners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming suchfeelings; -- she only endeavoured to counteract them by working onothers; -- represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix thetime of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished tosee, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plancould do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, whichwas within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was notbeyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servantmight easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be nooccasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now beat home in little more than three weeks' time. As Marianne's affectionfor her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺并不想劝说妹妹克制这种感情。她只想通过激起她的别的感情，来抵消这种感情。因此，她告诉妹妹：她不是很想见到亲爱的母亲吗，其实去克利夫兰是个再好不过的安排，可以使她们以最切实可行、最舒适的方式，回到母亲身边，确定一个日期也许不需要拖得很久了。克利夫兰距离布里斯托尔只有几英里远，从那里去巴顿不过一天的旅程，当然那是整整一天的路程，母亲的仆人可以很方便地去那里把她们接回家。因为她们不必要在克利夫兰呆到一个星期以上，所以她们再过三个星期就回到家了，玛丽安对母亲的感情是真挚的，这就便她很容易地消除了最初设想的可怕念头。">查看中文翻译</div>

Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter herdesign; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, everything relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be; -- andMarianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours thatwere yet to divide her from Barton.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might givehimself an escape from it; -- and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look ofparticular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had evenchanged her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended withagitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment. -- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in theinterval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to beapologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond adoubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次谈话对那位小姐产生的作用，逃不过詹宁斯太太的目光。她虽说是个体面人，不愿偷听别人说话、甚至为了有意使自己听不见，还把位子挪到玛丽安正在弹奏的钢琴跟前。但是，她情不自禁地发现，埃丽诺脸色变了，同时显得很激动，只顾得听上校说话，手上的活儿也停了下来。而更能印证她的希望的是，在玛丽安从一支曲子转到另一支曲子的间歇时刻，上校有些话不可避免地传到了她的耳朵里，听起来，他像是在为自己的房子不好表示歉意。这就使事情毋庸质疑了。她确实感到奇怪，他为什么要这样做。不过，她猜想这或许是正常的礼节。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, thatshe did not think THAT any material objection; -- and Mrs. Jenningscommended her in her heart for being so honest.

<div class="line_cn" title="詹宁斯太太听她表示感谢，不由得喜上心头，只是有些奇怪：上校听到这样一句话之后，居然还能安之若素地立即告辞而去，也不答复她一声：她没有想到，她的这位老朋友求起婚来会这么漫不经心。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased withhim. He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquaintedin a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for hisown sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I understandthat he intends to take orders. Will you be so good as to tell himthat the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by thisday's post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance-but THAT, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may benonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable. -- Itis a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did notmake more than 200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable ofimprovement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a verycomfortable income.

<div class="line_en">Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have beengreater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand. The preferment, which only two days before she had considered ashopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry; -- andSHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it! -- Heremotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very differentcause; -- but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, mighthave a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence, and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which togetherprompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmlyexpressed. She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke ofEdward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knewthem to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission withpleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an officeto another. But at the same time, she could not help thinking that noone could so well perform it as himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving anobligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be sparedherself; -- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, decliningit likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through hermeans, that she would not on any account make farther opposition. Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heardhis address from Miss Steele. She could undertake therefore to informhim of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing sorespectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that hementioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent; -- anevil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made verylight of, at least as far as regarded its size.</div>
