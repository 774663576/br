<div class="line_en">'Not he, sir. Never meant to,' replied the dairyman. 'As I say, 'tis a widow-woman, and she had money, it seems -- fifty poun' a year or so; and that was all he was after.

<div class="line_en">Yes, there was the pain of it. This question of a woman telling her story -- the heaviest of crosses to herself -- seemed but amusement to others. It was as if people should laugh at martyrdom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不错，痛苦就在这里。一个女人讲述自己的历史的问题——这是她背负的最沉重的十字架——但在别人看来只不过是一种笑料。这简直就像嘲笑圣徒殉教一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Tessy!' came from behind her, and Clare sprang across the gully, alighting beside her feet. 'My wife -- soon!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“苔丝！”一声叫声从她的背后传来，克莱尔从小沟那边跳过来，站在她的身边。“我的妻子——不久就是我的妻子了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a sorry smile, for form's sake, from Tess. What was comedy to them was tragedy to her; and she could hardly bear their mirth. She soon rose from table, and, with an impression that Clare would follow her, went along a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the irrigating channels, and now to the other, till she stood by the main stream of the Var. Men had been cutting the water-weeds higher up the river, and masses of them were floating past her -- moving islands of green crowfoot, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows from crossing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这段俏皮话引起了一阵哄然大笑，为了表示和大家一样，苔丝也跟着苦笑了一下。在他们眼中是一出喜剧，然而在她眼里却是一出悲剧；对于他们的欢乐，她简直受不了。她很快就从桌边站起身来，她有一种感觉，克莱尔会跟着她一起走的，她沿着一条弯弯曲曲的小道走着，有时候她走在灌溉渠的这一边，有时候走在灌溉渠的那一边，一直走到瓦尔河主流的附近才停下来。工人们已经开始在河流的上游割水草了，一堆一堆的水草从她面前漂过去——就像是绿色的毛茛小岛在移动，她差不多就可以站在上面了；河里栽有一排一排木桩，是为了防止奶牛跑过河去，这时挡住了流下来的水草。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It all turned on that release. What had given her strength to refuse him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman; and that would have been overcome in another moment. But Angel said no more; his face was perplexed; he went away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一松手，情势就发生了变化。这一次她之所以有力量拒绝他，完全是由于她刚才听了奶牛场老板讲的那个寡妇的故事；要是再过一会儿，那点儿力量也就要化为乌有了。不过安琪尔没有再说话；他脸上的表情是困惑的；他只好走开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not expecting this he had put his arm lightly round her waist the moment after speaking, beneath her hanging tall of hair. (The younger dairymaids, including Tess, breakfasted with their hair loose on Sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending church, a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads against the cows.) If she had said 'Yes' instead of 'No' he would have kissed her; it had evidently been his intention; but her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart. Their condition of domiciliary comradeship put her, as the woman, to such disadvantage by its enforced intercourse, that he felt it unfair to her to exercise any pressure of brandishment which he might have honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him. He released her momentarily-imprisoned waist, and withheld the kiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有想到她会说不。他把话说完就伸出胳膊紧紧地搂住了她的腰，搂在她披散的头发下面。（年轻的挤奶女工，包括苔丝，星期天吃早饭时都披散着头发，在去教堂的时候她们才把头发高高地挽起来，她们在挤牛奶的时候要用头靠着奶牛，所以不能那样梳法。）要是她说的是肯定而不是否定，他就一定吻过她了；这显然是他的意图；可是她坚决的否定阻止了他的顾虑重重的渴望。他们同住在一幢屋子里，不能不相互来往，这样她作为一个女人就被置于一种不利的地位。他觉得，要是他向她施加压力，步步紧逼，这对她就是不公平的，假如她能够避开他，他反倒可以诚实地采用这些手段了。他把围在她腰上的手松开了，也没有去吻她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Day after day they met -- somewhat less constantly than before; and thus two or three weeks went by. The end of September drew near, and she could see in his eye that he might ask her again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们还是天天见面——和过去相比，他们见面的次数有些减少了；两三个星期就这样过去了。九月末来到了，她从他的眼睛中可以看出，他也许还要向她求婚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess knew that she must break down. Neither a religious sense of a certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish for candour could hold out against it much longer. She loved him so passionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though untrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary guidance. And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, 'I can never be his wife,' the words were vain. A proof of her weakness lay in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the trouble to formulate. Every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted the recantation she feared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝也知道她必定要抵抗不住了。无论是认为她从前那次结合具有某种道德的效力的宗教观点，还是她想坦白过去的诚心愿望，都再也抵挡不住了。她爱他爱得这样热烈，在她的眼里，他就像天上的神一样；她虽然没有经过教育培养，但是她却天性敏慧，从本能上渴望得到他的呵护和指导。虽然她心里不断重复着说，“我决不能做他的妻子，”但是这也都成了毫无用处的话。她这种内心的说话，正好证明她冷静的决心已经遇到了问题，不能继续坚持了。每当她听到克莱尔开始提到从前提到的话题，心里头不免又惊又喜，渴望自己改口答应，又害怕自己改口答应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His plan of procedure was different now -- as though he had made up his mind that her negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth startled by the novelty of the proposal. The fitful evasiveness of her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea. So he played a more coaxing game; and while never going beyond words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost orally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他进行求婚的计划和过去不同了——仿佛他一心认为，她的拒绝只不过是被她没有经历过的求婚吓着了，不过因为年轻羞怯而已。每次讨论这个问题，她总是闪烁其辞，这使他越发相信自己的看法不错。因此他就采取哄和劝的方法；他从来都不超越使用语言的界限，也没有再想到拥抱抚摸，他只是想尽量用言辞去打动她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the purling milk -- at the cow's side, at skimmings, at butter-makings, at cheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs -- as no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱尔仍然坚持不懈地向她求婚，他低声求婚的声音就像是牛奶汩汩流动的声音——在奶牛旁边，在撇奶油的时候，在制作黄油的时候，在制作奶酪的时候，在孵蛋的母鸡中间，在生产的母猪中间——过去从来没有一个挤奶姑娘被这样一个男子求过婚。">查看中文翻译</div>

At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirt-sleeves and put his arm across the stairway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨，她穿着睡衣，像往常一样来到他的门口把他叫醒了；然后再回去穿好衣服，把其他的人也叫醒了；过了十分钟，她就拿着蜡烛向楼梯口走去。同时，克莱尔也穿着短袖衬衫从楼上下来，在楼梯口伸着胳膊把她拦住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His manner was -- what man's is not? -- so much that of one who would love and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes, charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it.

She passed downstairs very quickly, never looking back at him or saying another word. The other maids were already down, and the subject was not pursued.

<div class="line_en">In the afternoon several of the dairyman's household and assistants went down to the meads as usual, a long way from the dairy, where many of the cows were milked without being driven home. The supply was getting less as the animals advanced in calf, and the supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午，奶牛场的几个工人加上几个帮工，像往常一样一起来到老远的草场上，有许多奶牛没有被赶回家去，就在那儿挤奶。随着母牛腹中的牛犊的长大，牛奶也就出得越来越少了，在草场旺季时雇佣的过多的工人也就被辞退了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dairyman Crick, who was there with the rest, his wrapper gleaming miraculously white against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked at his heavy watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶牛场的克里克老板和其他的人呆在一起，在铅灰色的暮色的映衬下，他身上的围裙闪着白色的光，突然，他掏出他那块沉甸甸的怀表看了看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The work progressed leisurely. Each pailful was poured into tall cans that stood in a large spring-waggon which had been brought upon the scene; and when they were milked the cows trailed away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="工作在从容不迫地进行着。有一辆大车赶到了草场上，上面装着许多高大的铁罐，木桶里挤满了牛奶，就一桶桶倒进车上的大铁罐里；奶牛挤过奶以后，也就自个儿走掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Why, 'tis later than I thought,' he said. 'Begad! We shan't be soon enough with this milk at the station, if we don't mind. There's no time to-day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off. It must go to station straight from here. Who'll drive it across?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉呀，没有想到这样晚了，”他说。“糟啦！再不赶快就来不及送到车站了。今天送走牛奶的时间是不多了，也不能把牛奶拉回家和其它的牛奶混在一起了。牛奶只有从这儿直接送到车站啦。谁把牛奶送去呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Clare volunteered to do so, though it was none of his business, asking Tess to accompany him. The evening, though sunless, had been warm and muggy for the season, and Tess had come out with her milkinghood only, naked-armed and jacketless; certainly not dressed for a drive. She therefore replied by glancing over her scant habiliments; but Clare gently urged her. She assented by relinquishing her pall and stool to the dairyman to take home; and mounted the spring-waggon beside Clare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="送牛奶虽然不是克莱尔先生份内的事，但是他自愿去送牛奶，还请苔丝陪他一块儿去。傍晚虽然没有太阳，但是天气既闷热又潮湿，苔丝出门时只穿着挤奶的裙子，没有穿外套，露着胳膊，这身穿着的确不是为了赶大车而穿上的。因此，她打量了一眼身上的穿着，算是回答；不过克莱尔用温柔的目光鼓励她。她把牛奶桶和凳子交给奶牛场老板带回家去，算是答应了去送牛奶；然后她就上了大车，坐在克莱尔的身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
