<div class="line_en">On his departure, M. Andrea had inherited all the papers affirming that he had the honour to be the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Leonora Corsinari. He was thus more or less established in Parisian society, which is so open to receiving strangers and treating them, not as what they are, but as what they wish to be. In any case, what is required of a young man in Paris? To speak the language, more or less; to be acceptably turned out; to be a good sport; and to pay cash.</div>

<div class="line_en">During this time, M. Cavalcanti the elder had left to resume his post, not in the army of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the roulette tables of Bagni di Lucca, where he was one of the most loyal courtiers. It goes without saying that he had taken with him the amount allocated for his journey -- and as a reward for the solemn and dignified way in which he had played his role of father -- scrupulously counted down to the last paul.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the state of things in that portion of Parisian society to which we have introduced our readers when, one evening, Monte Cristo went to visit M. Danglars. Danglars himself was out, but the count was invited to visit the baroness, who was at liberty to receive guests, and he accepted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是我们已经向读者们介绍过的巴黎社交界当时的情形。有一天傍晚，基督山去拜访邓格拉司先生。邓格拉司出去了；但男爵夫人请伯爵进去，他接受了那个邀请。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a consequence, within a fortnight Andrea had acquired a reasonably good standing. He was addressed as "Monsieur le Comte", it was said that he had an income of 50,000 livres and there were rumours of an immense fortune belonging to his noble father, which was allegedly buried in the quarry at Saravezza. This last detail was stated as a fact in the presence of a scientist, who announced that he had seen that very quarry; this added a great deal of weight to statements that had, until then, been dubious and insubstantial, but henceforth took on the solidity of fact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，在两个星期之内，安德里已得到一个非常称心的地位。他被人称为子爵阁下；据说他每年有五万里弗的收益；大家又常常谈到他的父亲有一笔极大的财富埋藏在塞拉维柴的采石场里。关于最后这一点，最初人们谈到的时候还不曾把它当作事实，但后来有一位学者宣布说他曾看见过那些采石场，他的话给那个截至那时为止多少还有点怀疑的话题增加了很大的确实性，给它披上一件现实的外衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since the dinner at Auteuil and the subsequent events, Mme Danglars could not hear Monte Cristo's name without a sort of nervous twitch. If the mention of his name was not followed by the count's physical presence, this painful sensation intensified. On the other hand, if the count appeared, his open features, his shining eyes, his friendliness and his gallantry towards Mme Danglars very rapidly dispelled all traces of anxiety. It seemed to the baroness impossible that a man so charming in appearance could have any evil designs against her. In any case, even the most corrupt of us finds it hard to believe in evil unless it is based on some interest. We reject the idea of harm done for no cause and without gain as anomalous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从阿都尔的那次晚餐以及后来接着发生的那些事件出现以来，邓格拉司夫人每次听仆人来通报基督山的名字，总不免要打一个神经质的寒颤。假如他不来，那种痛苦的心绪就变得非常紧张；假如他来了，则他那高贵的面貌、他那明亮的眼睛、他那和蔼的态度以及他那殷勤关切的态度，不久就驱散了邓格拉司夫人一切恐惧的印象。在男爵夫人看来，一个态度这样亲切可爱的人是不可能对她存有坏心眼的。而且，即使心术最邪恶的人，也只有在与他发生利害关系的时候才会起坏心，否则，谁都不会平白地想起害人的念头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took in the whole scene at a glance. Beside the baroness, Eugénie was sitting, almost recumbent, on a sofa, with Cavalcanti standing. He was dressed in black like a hero from Goethe, with highly polished shoes and white silk stockings, running a white, well-manicured hand through his blond hair in the midst of which could be seen the flicker of a diamond: despite Monte Cristo's advice, the vain young man had not been able to resist slipping this stone on to his little finger. The hand movement was accompanied by provocative glances at Mlle Danglars and sighs dispatched in the same direction as the glances.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督山在一瞥之下就把这整个场面收入眼底。男爵夫人斜靠在一张鸳鸯椅上，欧琴妮坐在她的身边，卡凡尔康德则站着。卡凡尔康德一身黑衣，象歌德诗歌里的主角那样，穿着黑漆皮鞋和镂花的白丝袜，一只相当好看的雪白的手插在他那浅色的头发里，头发中间有一颗钻石在闪闪发光，那是因为基督山虽曾加以劝告，但那个好虚荣的青年人却禁不住仍要在他的小手指上戴一只钻戒。除了这个动作以外，他还时时向邓格拉司小姐投送勾魂摄魄的眼波和乞怜的叹息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir into which we have already once introduced our readers -- and where the baroness was casting an anxious eye over drawings handed to her by her daughter after she had looked at them with the younger Cavalcanti -- the count's presence produced its usual effect and the baroness received him with a smile, though she had been somewhat troubled at the sound of his name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当基督山踏进那间我们已经向读者们介绍过一次的妇女会客室的时候，欧琴妮小姐正在那儿和卡凡尔康德先生一同欣赏几幅图画，他们看过以后，就传给男爵夫人看。伯爵的拜访不久就产生了象往常一样的效果；仆人来通报的时候，男爵夫人虽然略微有一点仓皇失措，但她依旧带笑接待伯爵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shortly afterwards, the banker himself came in. His first look was towards Monte Cristo, the second towards Andrea. As for his wife, he greeted her as certain husbands do greet their wives, a thing that bachelors will be able to imagine only when someone has done a very profound analysis of the conventions of married life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="银行家不久就回来了。他的目光首先的确落到基督山身上，但其次就轮到安德里。至于他的妻子，他用某些丈夫对待他们妻子的那种态度向她鞠了一躬，但那种态度未婚的男子是决不能了解的，除非将来关于夫妇生活出版了一部非常广泛周到的法典。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mlle Danglars was still the same: that is to say, beautiful, cold and contemptuous. Not a single glance or sigh from Andrea escaped her, but they appeared to be deflected by the breastplate of Minerva, which philosophers sometimes say in fact covered the breast of Sappho.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓格拉司小姐还是老样子——冷淡、美丽和喜欢讽刺，那种眼光、那种叹息，一次都不曾逃过她的眼睛和耳朵；但那种眼光和叹息可说是落到了司艺女神密娜伐的盾牌上面——那片盾，据某些哲学家的考证，曾几次保护了希腊女诗人萨弗的胸口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eugénie greeted the count coldly and took advantage of the earliest opportunity in the conversation to take herself off to her study, whence two voices could shortly be heard, merry and boisterous, accompanied by the first chords on a piano, informing Monte Cristo that Mlle Danglars had just preferred the company of Mlle Louise d'Armilly, her singing instructor, to his own and that of M. Cavalcanti.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧琴妮冷淡地向伯爵鞠了一躬，寒暄以后，她立刻托故逃到她的书斋里，不久，那儿就有两个愉快的声音随着钢琴的音律响亮地歌唱起来。基督山因此知道邓格拉司小姐不愿意陪伴他和卡凡尔康德先生而情愿和她的音乐教师罗茜·亚密莱小姐作伴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of all, even as he was talking to Mme Danglars and appeared entirely absorbed in the conversation, the count noticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti: his anxiety, his way of going over to the door to listen to the music (without daring to go through it), his way of expressing his admiration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时，伯爵一面和邓格拉司夫人谈话，装出显然对谈话非常感到兴趣的样子，一面却特别注意安德里·卡凡尔康德先生那种怀念的神色，那种倾听他不敢进去的那扇门里传来的音乐的态度，以及他那种钦慕的表示。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danglars at once went across to the door between the two rooms and opened it, to reveal the two young women sitting on the same piano seat in front of the same piano. Each was playing the part for one hand, an exercise that they had practised to amuse themselves and at which they had become remarkably proficient.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓格拉司立刻向那扇门走去，把门打开。那两位青年小姐并排坐在钢琴前面的椅子上，她们在互相伴奏，每人用一只手——她们很喜欢这样练习，而且已合作得极其纯熟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Framed in this way by the door, Mlle d'Armilly could now be seen with Eugénie forming one of those tableaux vivants which are often exhibited in Germany. She was of quite exceptional beauty -- or, rather, of exquisite sweetness. She was a small woman, as slender and blonde as a fairy, with eyes heavy with tiredness and long hair falling in ringlets across an excessively long neck, of the sort that Perugino sometimes gives to his virgins. It was said that she had a weak chest and that, like Antonia in the Violon de Crémone, she would one day die singing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那打开着的门口望进去，亚密莱小姐和欧琴妮组成了一幅德国人非常爱好的活画面。她多少有几分姿色，极其文雅——身材还算好，只是瘦了一点，大绺鬈发垂到她的脖子上（那条脖子有点太长了，好象庇鲁杰诺所雕塑的某些仙女一样），眼睛疲乏无神。据说她的胸部很弱，将来有一天，会象《克里蒙的小提琴》①中的安东妮那样死于歌唱。【注：①《克里蒙的小提琴》是德国音乐家兼小说家霍夫曼（1776－1822）的小说，安东妮是小说的女主人公。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alas, no, Monsieur," Andrea replied, with an even more perceptible sigh than the earlier ones.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, then?" the banker said to his daughter. "Are you trying to keep us out?" And he led the young man into the small drawing-room. Whether by chance or intentionally, the door was pushed to behind Andrea so that, from where they were sitting, neither Monte Cristo nor the baroness could see anything. But, as the banker had followed Andrea, Mme Danglars did not appear to notice this fact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢！”银行家对他的女儿说，“把我们都排斥了吗？”于是他就领那个青年人到书斋里去，而且不知究竟是碰巧或是故意，安德里进去以后，那扇门就成了个半掩的状态，所以从伯爵或男爵夫人所坐的地方望过去，他们什么都看不到；但因为有银行家陪着安德里，邓格拉司夫人也就不去注意他们了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shortly afterwards the count heard Andrea's voice harmonizing with the sound of the piano which accompanied a Corsican song. As he listened to this with a smile -- forgetting Andrea and recalling Benedetto -- Mme Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband's strength of character, since that very morning he had again lost three or four hundred thousand francs in a Milanese bankruptcy. Indeed, the praise was well merited: if the count had not known of it through the baroness, or perhaps through one of those means he had of knowing everything, the baron's face would have told him nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵不久就听到安德里的声音，在钢琴的伴奏下，高唱一曲科西嘉的民歌。听到这种歌声，伯爵微笑起来，这歌声使他忘记安德里，想起贝尼台多，邓格拉司夫人则向基督山夸奖她丈夫的意志坚强，因为那天早晨他刚由于米兰的商业失败而损失了三四十万法郎。这种夸奖实在是应该的，因为要不是伯爵从男爵夫人的口里听到这回事，或用他那种无所不知的方法去打听，单从男爵的脸上，他却不会怀疑到这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo took in this female group in a single, rapid, searching glance. It was the first time he had seen Mlle d'Armilly, though he had often heard her mentioned in this house.</div>
