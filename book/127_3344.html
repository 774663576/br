<div class="line_en">On this very afternoon, while Sara was out, a strange thing happened in the attic. Only Melchisedec saw and heard it; and he was so much alarmed and mystified that he scuttled back to his hole and hid there, and really quaked and trembled as he peeped out furtively and with great caution to watch what was going on.</div>

<div class="line_en">The attic had been very still all the day after Sara had left it in the early morning. The stillness had only been broken by the pattering of the rain upon the slates and the skylight. Melchisedec had, in fact, found it rather dull; and when the rain ceased to patter and perfect silence reigned, he decided to come out and reconnoiter, though experience taught him that Sara would not return for some time. He had been rambling and sniffing about, and had just found a totally unexpected and unexplained crumb left from his last meal, when his attention was attracted by a sound on the roof. He stopped to listen with a palpitating heart. The sound suggested that something was moving on the roof. It was approaching the skylight; it reached the skylight. The skylight was being mysteriously opened. A dark face peered into the attic; then another face appeared behind it, and both looked in with signs of caution and interest. Two men were outside on the roof, and were making silent preparations to enter through the skylight itself. One was Ram Dass and the other was a young man who was the Indian gentleman's secretary; but of course Melchisedec did not know this. He only knew that the men were invading the silence and privacy of the attic; and as the one with the dark face let himself down through the aperture with such lightness and dexterity that he did not make the slightest sound, Melchisedec turned tail and fled precipitately back to his hole. He was frightened to death. He had ceased to be timid with Sara, and knew she would never throw anything but crumbs, and would never make any sound other than the soft, low, coaxing whistling; but strange men were dangerous things to remain near. He lay close and flat near the entrance of his home, just managing to peep through the crack with a bright, alarmed eye. How much he understood of the talk he heard I am not in the least able to say; but, even if he had understood it all, he would probably have remained greatly mystified.</div>

<div class="line_en">The secretary, who was light and young, slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as Ram Dass had done; and he caught a last glimpse of Melchisedec's vanishing tail.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The child is the little friend of all things, Sahib," he answered. "She is not as other children. I see her when she does not see me. I slip across the slates and look at her many nights to see that she is safe. I watch her from my window when she does not know I am near. She stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to her. The sparrows come at her call. The rat she has fed and tamed in her loneliness. The poor slave of the house comes to her for comfort. There is a little child who comes to her in secret; there is one older who worships her and would listen to her forever if she might. This I have seen when I have crept across the roof. By the mistress of the house -- who is an evil woman -- she is treated like a pariah; but she has the bearing of a child who is of the blood of kings!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那孩子是所有动物的小朋友，先生，”他回答。“她和其他儿童不同。我看她的时候她没有看见我。很多夜晚，我溜过石板瓦去看看她是否安全无恙。我从我的窗口观察她时，她并不知道我就在附近。她站在那儿的桌上向外望着天空，好像苍天在对她说话呢。她一召唤，麻雀就飞到她身边。那只老鼠是她在孤独寂寞中喂养驯服的。那家有个可怜的小奴仆到她那儿寻求安慰。有个小孩偷偷来找她，还有个大一点儿的崇拜她，如果可能的话，愿意永远听她讲话。这是我爬过屋顶所见到的。至于那栋房子的女主人——是个可恶的妇人——像对待印度贱民一样虐待她，但她具备王室血统的孩子所有的那种风度！">查看中文翻译</div>

I know when she is alone until midnight, learning from her books; I know when her secret friends steal to her and she is happier -- as children can be, even in the midst of poverty -- because they come and she may laugh and talk with them in whispers. If she were ill I should know, and I would come and serve her if it might be done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她的一切日常生活我都知道，”拉姆·达斯回答。“她出去我知道，她回来我知道，她的悲哀和难得的快乐，以及冷暖和饥饱我都知道。我知道她独坐读书到深夜，我知道她那些秘密朋友什么时候偷偷来找她，由于她们来了她可以同她们低声说笑而感到快活一点儿——孩子们总是能这样的，即使处在穷困中。如果她病了，我会知道的，还会前去照料她，如果允许那样做的话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is true that the first thought was mine, Sahib," he said; "though it was naught but a fancy. I am fond of this child; we are both lonely. It is her way to relate her visions to her secret friends. Being sad one night, I lay close to the open skylight and listened. The vision she related told what this miserable room might be if it had comforts in it. She seemed to see it as she talked, and she grew cheered and warmed as she spoke. Then she came to this fancy; and the next day, the Sahib being ill and wretched, I told him of the thing to amuse him. It seemed then but a dream, but it pleased the Sahib. To hear of the child's doings gave him entertainment. He became interested in her and asked questions. At last he began to please himself with the thought of making her visions real things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最初是我的想法，那倒是真的，先生，”他说，“虽然它算不上什么，只不过是忽发奇想而已。我喜欢这孩子，我们俩都很孤单。她惯常给她的秘密朋友们讲她的梦想。一天夜里我心情不好，就躺在这敞开的天窗边聆听。她当时描述着如果这间陋室内有了使生活舒适的东西会是个什么光景。她讲时就像是她亲眼所见一般，而且越讲越高兴，越感到温暖。然后她讲到了这个幻想。第二天，老爷病了，情绪恶劣，我就给他讲这事使他高兴。那时看来这似乎不过是个梦，但它使老爷很高兴。听我讲那孩子的所作所为，他觉得是种享受。他变得对她关心起来，问了些问题。最后他要让她的梦想成为现实，以此自娱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You think that it can be done while she sleeps? Suppose she awakened," suggested the secretary; and it was evident that whatsoever the plan referred to was, it had caught and pleased his fancy as well as the Sahib Carrisford's.</div>

<div class="line_en">They did not remain very long, to the great relief of Melchisedec, who, as he probably did not comprehend their conversation, felt their movements and whispers ominous. The young secretary seemed interested in everything. He wrote down things about the floor, the fireplace, the broken footstool, the old table, the walls -- which last he touched with his hand again and again, seeming much pleased when he found that a number of old nails had been driven in various places.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can move as if my feet were of velvet," Ram Dass replied; "and children sleep soundly -- even the unhappy ones. I could have entered this room in the night many times, and without causing her to turn upon her pillow. If the other bearer passes to me the things through the window, I can do all and she will not stir. When she awakens she will think a magician has been here."</div>
