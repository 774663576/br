<div class="line_en">I looked over at Augustus, who was staring out the window, and as we dipped below the low-hung clouds, I straightened my back to see the Netherlands. The land seemed sunk into the ocean, little rectangles of green surrounded on all sides by canals. We landed, in fact, parallel to a canal, like there were two runways: one for us and one for waterfowl.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Something like that," Mom said. The cabbie pulled out into traffic and we headed toward a highway with lots of blue signs featuring double vowels: Oosthuizen, Haarlem. Beside the highway, flat empty land stretched for miles, interrupted by the occasional huge corporate headquarters. In short, Holland looked like Indianapolis, only with smaller cars. "This is Amsterdam?" I asked the cabdriver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差不多吧。”妈妈说。出租车上路了，我们朝一条竖满了蓝色标志牌的公路开去，标志牌上的地名全都有双元音：Oosthuizen，Haarlem。公路两边，大片平坦宽阔的土地绵延数英里，只偶尔点缀着一些公司总部的巨型建筑。一句话：荷兰看起来跟印第安纳波利斯一个样，只不过汽车小一点。“这是阿姆斯特丹？”我问司机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It happened all at once: We exited the highway and there were the row houses of my imagination leaning precariously toward canals, ubiquitous bicycles, and coffeeshops advertising LARGE SMOKING ROOM. We drove over a canal and from atop the bridge I could see dozens of houseboats moored along the water. It looked nothing like America. It looked like an old painting, but real -- everything achingly idyllic in the morning light -- and I thought about how wonderfully strange it would be to live in a place where almost everything had been built by the dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="景色的变化发生在突然之间。一下公路，我就看到了想象中成排的房屋，摇摇欲坠地倚着运河而建，自行车无处不在，咖啡馆外的招牌写着“宽敞吸烟室”字样。我们经过一条运河，从桥上能看到水上停泊着船屋。这里和美国完全不一样。它看上去就像一幅古老的画作，但却是真实存在的：在晨光里，一切都充满诗情画意、田园风光。我想，如果能住在这样一个地方，一切几乎全是由已死的人建造的，那该是多么奇妙而又奇怪呀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Many of the canal houses date from the Golden Age, the seventeenth century," he said.

<div class="line_en">The Filosoof was right next to the Vondelpark, Amsterdam's most famous park.

<div class="line_en">All the rooms in the Hotel Filosoof were named after filosoofers: Mom and I were staying on the ground floor in the Kierkegaard; Augustus was on the floor above us, in the Heidegger. Our room was small: a double bed pressed against a wall with my BiPAP machine, an oxygen concentrator, and a dozen refillable oxygen tanks at the foot of the bed. Past the equipment, there was a dusty old paisley chair with a sagging seat, a desk, and a bookshelf above the bed containing the collected works of Søren Kierkegaard. On the desk we found a wicker basket full of presents from the Genies: wooden shoes, an orange Holland T-shirt, chocolates, and various other goodies.</div>

<div class="line_en">I did indeed wear the sundress -- this blue print, flowey knee-length Forever 21 thing -- with tights and Mary Janes because I liked being quite a lot shorter than him.

There were indeed two flutes of champagne at our white-tableclothed table. The slight chill in the air was balanced magnificently by the sunshine; on one side of us, cyclists pedaled past -- well-dressed men and women on their way home from work, improbably attractive blond girls riding sidesaddle on the back of a friend's bike, tiny helmetless kids bouncing around in plastic seats behind their parents. And on our other side, the canal water was choked with millions of the confetti seeds. Little boats were moored at the brick banks, half full of rainwater, some of them near sinking. A bit farther down the canal, I could see houseboats floating on pontoons, and in the middle of the canal, an open-air, flat-bottomed boat decked out with lawn chairs and a portable stereo idled toward us. Augustus took his flute of champagne and raised it. I took mine, even though I'd never had a drink aside from sips of my dad's beer.</div>

"You know how there is famously no place less played in than a hospital playground?" I nodded. "Well, I was at Memorial for a couple weeks when they took off the leg and everything. I was up on the fifth floor and I had a view of the playground, which was always of course utterly desolate. I was all awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard. But then this girl started showing up alone at the playground, every day, swinging on a swing completely alone, like you'd see in a movie or something. So I asked one of my nicer nurses to get the skinny on the girl, and the nurse brought her up to visit, and it was Caroline, and I used my immense charisma to win her over."

<div class="line_en">He laughed it off. "The thing about dead people," he said, and then stopped himself. "The thing is you sound like a bastard if you don't romanticize them, but the truth is… complicated, I guess.

<div class="line_en">"Right, but really, I mean aside from us obviously, cancer kids are not statistically more likely to be awesome or compassionate or perseverant or whatever. Caroline was always moody and miserable, but I liked it. I liked feeling as if she had chosen me as the only person in the world not to hate, and so we spent all this time together just ragging on everyone, you know? Ragging on the nurses and the other kids and our families and whatever else. But I don't know if that was her or the tumor. I mean, one of her nurses told me once that the kind of tumor Caroline had is known among medical types as the Asshole Tumor, because it just turns you into a monster. So here's this girl missing a fifth of her brain who's just had a recurrence of the Asshole Tumor, and so she was not, you know, the paragon of stoic cancer-kid heroism. She was… I mean, to be honest, she was a bitch. But you can't say that, because she had this tumor, and also she's, I mean, she's dead. And she had plenty of reason to be unpleasant, you know?"</div>
