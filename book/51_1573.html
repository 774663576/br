<div class="line_en">Apparently, Effie Trinket's duties did not conclude at the station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena. In a way, that's a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we haven't seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train. Probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other hand, seems to be flying high. We're the first team she's ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. She's complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone who's anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day, trying to win us sponsors.</div>

<div class="line_en">I've ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for my father's death and then yesterday to say my final good-byes to my friends and family. But that's a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk. The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air. It's exhilarating and I'm tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again, but somehow that seems childish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我以前在十二区的法院大楼坐过电梯。一次是爸爸过世时去领奖章时坐过，还有一次是昨天早晨和朋友及家人说再见的时候。可那里的电梯昏暗无光，上升的时候咯吱吱响，像蜗牛一样慢，还有股酸奶的臭味。可这里的电梯四面水晶，快速上升时可以看到地面的人缩小成蚂蚁那么大。乘坐这种电梯真是太令人兴奋了，我真想问问艾菲特琳奇我们能否再坐一次，可又觉得那么做太孩子气了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My quarters are larger than our entire house back home. They are plush, like the train car, but also have so many automatic gadgets that I'm sure I won't have time to press all the buttons. The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature, pressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging sponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come on that blow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a box that sends a current through my scalp, untangling, parting, and drying my hair almost instantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room. I'm glad to see the stylists, particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us. A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, dinner isn't really about food, it's about planning out our strategies, and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走进餐厅时，皮塔、西纳和波西娅正站在阳台上，从这里可以俯瞰凯匹特城。我很高兴见到两位设计师，特别是得知黑密斯也要来之后。如果晚饭时艾菲和黑密斯碰头，他们很可能会不欢而散，那就糟了；再说，晚餐不仅仅和吃饭有关，还要讨论我们的制敌策略；西纳和波西娅成功也说明了他们的意见十分宝贵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="正要上菜的时候，黑密斯出现了。他好像也有自己的设计师，看上去干净整洁，表情严肃，我以前从没见过他这样。他没有拒绝葡萄酒，但当他开始喝汤时，我突然觉得这是第一次看见他吃饭。也许这次他真能在足够长的时间内打起精神，来帮助我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it down, but I've never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs, and when will I get a chance to try it again?

<div class="line_en">Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie. At least they're addressing each other decently. And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists' opening act. While they make small talk, I concentrate on the meal. Mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine, move wordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters and glasses full.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西纳和波西娅在场，似乎对黑密斯和艾菲也有所制约，使得他们举止文明得体。至少，他们之间能体面地称呼彼此，他们俩言谈话语中对两位设计师在开幕式上取得的成功也充满溢美之词。在大家小声交谈时，我的心思却都放在晚餐上，蘑菇汤、豌豆大的番茄拌苦苣、像纸一样薄的烤牛排、绿沙司酱通心粉、点缀着甘甜的蓝葡萄、入口即化的奶酪。与上酒的侍者一样，其他侍者也都穿着白色束腰上衣，默默地在餐桌旁忙碌着，为我们添菜加酒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts feeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I don't like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full-time is a mystery.</div>

It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of doubt. "What makes it burn? Is it alcohol?" I say, looking up at the girl.

The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sure, come on," says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof. There's a small dome-shaped room with a door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening air, I catch my breath at the view. The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, usually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the evenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is when they're airing the Games or some important government message on television that it's mandatory to watch. But here there would be no shortage. Ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，走吧。”皮塔说。我跟在他身后，登上通往楼顶的台阶。楼顶有一个圆拱形的房间，一扇门通往室外。我走出去，外面的空气很凉爽，风也听大。我被眼前的景象惊呆了。凯匹特夜晚好像有无数的萤火虫在闪耀。十二区的供电时有时无，一般情况下只有几小时供电，多数的夜晚都用蜡烛照明，唯一不断电的时候就是转播猎杀游戏或有重要电视新闻时。可这里不会断电，永远不会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I look straight down the side of the building to the street, which is buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. In District 12, we'd all be thinking about bed right now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔和我走到楼边的栏杆处，我从楼顶直直地向下望去。大街上车水马龙，可以听到汽车的呜呜声、人们的喊叫声，还有奇怪的金属敲击声。在十二区，我们现在能想的只有上床睡觉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

I've never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before. But that doesn't mean we're not being taped. "Do you think they're watching us now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“总担心我们的安全。”我说。就算西纳带皮塔来过楼顶，可我仍担心此时我们是否被允许来这儿。天已经很晚了，我们孤伶伶的。我以前在电视上看到过培训中心的“贡品”来到楼顶。可这并不意味着我们此时没有监视器监控。“你觉得现在他们正在监视我们吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the other side of the dome, they've built a garden with flower beds and potted trees. From the branches hang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard.

<div class="line_en">For a moment I'm silent, as I remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed them. If we'd moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, yes, but we're both hunters. We know how animals look at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them. But we only watched.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere," I continue to Peeta. "I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there. It didn't make a sound, but they saw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But I'm certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boy's name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“直升飞机从天而降，”我继续对皮塔说，“我是说，刚刚天上什么也没有，瞬间飞机就出现了。飞机悄然无声，可他们已经看见了。上面撒下一张网罩住女孩，然后把她拉了上去，拉得很快，就像电梯一样。他们又冲男孩扔下一只带绳索的长矛，他也被拽了上去。但我肯定他已经死了。我们还听到那女孩的一声喊叫，叫的是男孩的名字，我想。然后直升机就消失了，消失在空中。鸟又开始鸣叫，好像一切都没发生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
