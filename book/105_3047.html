<div class="line_en">The darkness was so heavy it was like a thick blanket smothering her. For one panic-stricken moment, she thought she was blind. Frantic, she tried waving her hand in front of her face. She saw nothing, but managed to poke herself in the eye. The shock of the jabbing pain made her think for a moment. They had been in a tunnel -- that was why it was dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her eyes couldn't make out even the tiniest pinprick of light. She tried to push herself up from where she'd been thrown sideways onto the chair next to her, but something was pinning her down. Twisting to the right, she managed to pull herself down onto the floor between the seats. Her left hand landed on something warm and sticky. She yanked it away and quickly wiped it on her jeans, trying not to think about what the stickiness might have been. Her right hand curled around a small object -- the phone that had been in her hand when the world had been turned upside down. Eagerly she picked it up and turned it over. Relief rolled through her, but it was quickly replaced by disappointment. The screen was blank. Her fingers jabbed at the touch screen, hope fading fast. It was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的双眼连一丝一毫微弱的光都看不到。刚才她被甩到了旁边的座位上，现在她尽力想站起来，但是不知被什么东西绊住了。她的身体扭向右侧，设法倒在两个座位间的地板上。左手落下时碰到了一些暖烘烘黏糊糊的东西，她赶紧抽手，在牛仔裤上蹭了蹭，尽力不去想那黏糊糊的东西可能是什么。她的右手在一个小物件上摸索着—那是她的手机，刚才乾坤倒转时一直握在她手里。她心里涌动起如释重负的感觉，但很快就失望了。屏幕一片空白，她的手指点着触摸屏，希望很快就破灭了。手机死机了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shit! Ow!" she exhaled, ducking back down. Her hand reached for her temple, which was throbbing ferociously. It didn't seem to be bleeding, but it hurt like hell. Carefully this time, she straightened up again, using her hands to guide her head to a safe place. It was so dark she couldn't even see what she'd bumped into.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“该死，噢！”迪伦大叫了一声。她赶紧把头低下。手摸了摸正狂跳不已的太阳穴。似乎没有流血，可是疼得要命。这次她小心翼翼地抬起头来，用双手在前面给脑袋开道。四周太黑了，她连刚才撞到了什么都没看清。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hello?" she called timidly. There was no answering voice, no rustling sounds of other passengers moving about. The carriage had been packed, where the hell was everyone? The pool of liquid on the floor by her seat flashed back into her mind, but she pushed it away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有人吗？”她怯生生地喊着。没人回应，连其他乘客走动时窸窸窣窸的脚步声也没有。刚才车上还坐满了人，现在人究竟都到哪儿去了？脑海里闪过刚才座位旁地板上那一大摊液体，她尽力不去想这些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Crawling into the aisle, Dylan got her feet beneath her and stood up, smacking her head hard on something.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hello?" Stronger this time. "Can anybody hear me? Hello!" Her voice cracked a little on the final word as panic began to rear its ugly head. Her breathing quickened and she struggled to think through the fear that gripped her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有人吗？”这次她加大了声音，“有人听到我说话吗？有人吗？” 喊到最后声音已经有些沙哑了，恐慌又开始抬头。她的呼吸越来越急促，她努力想把心中无边的恐惧感想个清楚、弄个明白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The darkness was claustrophobic and she clutched at her throat, as if something was strangling her. She was all alone, surrounded by… by… She didn't want to think about it. All she knew was that she couldn't bear to stay in the carriage a second longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼前的黑暗让她产生了幽闭恐惧，她抓着自己的喉咙，像是有什么东西在掐着她似的。她现在孤身一人，周围是……是……她不敢想下去了。她只知道自己在车厢里再多待一秒都受不了了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ignoring the throbbing in her neck, Dylan held on to the pole fiercely with both hands, feeling like it was her grip on reality. Pole, her brain told her. The pole is next to the door. You must be next to the door. Relief flooded her system and allowed her to think a little more clearly. That's why she was alone. Everyone else must have made their way out already, and they'd missed her because she'd been buried under that stupid woman's bags. I should have sat next to the Rangers fans, she thought, laughing weakly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦顾不上脖子一阵阵的抽痛，双手紧紧抓着栏杆，就好像这样就抓住了现实一样。她心里想，这根栏杆就挨着车门，现在自己肯定也在车门口，于是她全身都放松了下来，思维也比刚才清楚了一些。她之所以现在孤身一人原因就在这儿，其他乘客肯定已经夺门而逃了。他们没注意到她是因为她刚才被压在那个胖女人身下。早知道就坐在流浪者队球迷身边了。想到这儿，她有气无力地笑了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mindlessly she surged forward, tripping and hauling herself over objects that stood in her way. Her foot landed on something soft and slick. The tread on her trainers found no friction and slipped. Horrified, she tried to jerk her leg up and away from the suspiciously spongy object, but her other shoe couldn't find a safe and level place to land. As if in slow motion, she felt herself falling towards the floor and the fearsome things that lurked there. No! Gasping, she threw her hands down to protect herself as she tumbled towards the ground. Her flailing arms caught a pole and her fingers tightened around it, bringing her to an abrupt stop that strained the muscles in her shoulder. Her momentum carried her forward and she jarred her neck painfully against the cold metal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想都没想就拼命往前冲，一路跌跌撞撞，不断费力地越过障碍物。她的脚落在某个柔软光滑的东西上面，运动鞋踩上去没有一点阻碍，她险些滑倒。她吓坏了，拔腿便跑，想离这堆像海绵一样的东西远点，但另一只鞋却找不到安全平坦的地方下脚。于是就像电影慢镜头一样，她不由自主地朝着地面和那一堆令人毛骨悚然的东西缓缓倒了下去。不！她喘着粗气，在身子摔倒时伸手自我保护。挥动的手臂正好触到一根金属栏杆，她的手指紧紧攥住杆子，于是身体下行戛然而止，全部压力都移到了肩部肌肉上。她乘势向前倾，脖子撞到冰冷的金属上，一阵剧痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dammit," she murmured. The electricity had probably been cut off during the crash. She looked back over her shoulder, a pointless exercise as she could see nothing. Her imagination filled in the blanks, packing the route through the carriage with upturned seats, luggage, broken glass from the windows and squishy, slick things that were solidifying in her mind's eye into limbs and torsos. No, she was not going back that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“该死！”她小声嘀咕了一句。在撞车事故中，车上的电可能已经被切断了。她转头观瞧，这个动作做得毫无意义，因为什么也看不到。想象填补了视觉上的空白，她仿佛看到了整个车厢一路上尽是向上翘的座椅、行李，窗子上的碎玻璃还有些黏糊糊软塌塌的东西—在她的想象中这些东西便具体化为残肢断腿。不，她绝不能再回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not trusting her feet in the darkness, she reached along the partition connected to the pole, expecting to come into contact with the folded open door. Her fingertips stretched out but found nothing. Shuffling a little further forward she found the door at last. It was shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗中，她不相信自己的腿，伸出手顺着与栏杆相连的隔板向前摸索，希望能摸到那扇打开的折叠门。她的指尖向前探，却一无所获。又慢慢向前挪了几步，她终于发现了门，却是关着的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's weird, she thought, but then shrugged. Everyone else must have gone out of the door at the other end. That was just typical of her luck. Her logical reasoning calmed her and helped her to think clearly. Unwilling to travel back across the carriage and risk stepping on some more worryingly soft things, she felt around for the button to open the door. Her fingers found its raised edges and pushed, but it remained closed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就怪了！她想着，耸了耸肩。其他人一定都是从另一侧的出口逃生了。她的运气一贯如此。经过一番逻辑推理，她冷静了下来，思维也清晰了。她不愿意再折返回去，冒着又踩到软乎乎的东西的风险穿过车厢，那会让人更加焦虑不安。她四处摸索想找到开门的按钮，手指碰到了它凸起的边缘，使劲推了推，但门仍然紧闭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Putting both hands flat against the train doors, she pushed hard. Though they held, she felt them buckle a little. With enough effort she thought she could force them open. She stepped back, took a deep breath and launched forward, kicking the door as hard as she could with the bottom of her left foot. The bang sounded very loud in the confined space, ringing a little in her ears, and her knee and ankle twinged painfully, complaining about the force of the impact. Nonetheless, she could feel fresh air against her face and that gave her hope. Her hands confirmed it: one section of the door had been forced off its runner. If she could do the same to the other door, there would be a gap big enough for her to squeeze through. She took two steps back this time and threw herself against the door with as much strength as she could muster. The door screeched as metal rasped against metal, before finally giving way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把手平放在车门上使劲推。尽管门没有开，但她能感到门还是有点变形。她觉得只要自己力气够大就能推开门。她后退几步，深吸一口气，然后猛地向前，左脚后跟用尽了全力踹门。狭小的空间里传来砰的一声巨响，余音绕耳。这一下对膝盖和脚踝的冲击力不小，两个部位顿时感到一阵剧痛。但外面的新鲜空气吹到脸上，这让她看到了希望。她的双手一试，一扇门已经脱离了滑槽。如果她对着另一扇门也来这么一下子，两扇门之间的空隙就足够她挤出去了。这次她倒退了两步，使出十分的力气，用身体撞门。两扇金属门之间相互剐蹭，发出刺耳的声音，最后终于让出了一道豁口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gap was not a large one, but luckily neither was Dylan. Turning sideways, she squeezed her body through the opening. There was a ripping sound as her zip caught between her body and the door, but suddenly she was free and falling towards the track. She felt a moment of fear thrill through her, but her trainers crunched on gravel after just a short distance and the feeling of claustrophobia lifted like a chain that had been cut free from around her throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="缺口不算大，幸运的是迪伦的身量也不大。她侧身从空隙中穿过去，拉链正好卡在身体和门之间，传来衣服撕裂的声音。接着她一下子失去了重心，身体朝着铁轨倒了下去。那一瞬间她感到毛骨悚然，但她的运动鞋马上嘎吱一声踩在了碎石子上。幽闭恐惧症的感觉随之消失，如同卡扼在喉咙上的锁链终于被割断了一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tunnel went on and on. She was on the verge of turning back and trying the other way when she saw what she thought was a dot of light ahead. Hoping for a way out, or a rescuer equipped with a torch, she stumbled faster, desperate to be outside in the brightness again. It took a long time, but slowly the dot turned into an arch. Beyond it she could only see a little daylight, but that was enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隧道不停地向前延伸。她几乎要掉头回去，到另一条路上碰碰运气了。这时她看到前方豆大的一点亮光。她希望那是出口或是救援人员装备的手电，于是跌跌撞撞地加快了脚步，一心只想着走出去，重新沐浴在光明中。她走了很久，终于看清那豆大的光原来是一处拱顶。再往前能看到些许光亮，但光线不是很强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without a light to guide her, she tripped often and so it was slow progress. Every now and then something by her feet would scurry quickly away. She hoped there weren't rats in the tunnel. Anything smaller than a rabbit caused outbursts of irrational fear in her. A spider in the bathroom could trigger half an hour of hysteria until Joan could be persuaded to come and rescue her. If anything ran over her shoe in here she knew her flight instinct would kick in. In the dark, though, with the uneven ground, she'd probably fall flat on her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有光照，她脚下磕磕绊绊，步履艰难。不时有东西从脚边闪避到一旁，她只盼那不是隧道里的老鼠。任何比兔子小的东西都能引发她心里莫名的恐惧，浴室里的一只蜘蛛就能让她情绪失控半小时，直到最后把琼喊进来解围才算完。要是这里有什么东西爬到她的鞋上，她知道自己的本能反应就是赶紧把它踢开。尽管四周一团漆黑，路面又凹凸不平，这样做很可能会让她栽个嘴啃泥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tunnel was as dark as the train. The crash must have happened right at the centre. Dylan looked first one way, then the other. It didn't help. She could see no light, and apart from the gentle sound of air rushing through the enclosed space, there was silence. Eeny, meeny, miney, mo, she thought. Sighing, she turned right and trudged forward. It had to lead somewhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隧道里和车上一样黑，事故一定发生在隧道正中间。迪伦先看了看一端，又看看另一端。没用的，两边都是一点光都不透，除了空气轻轻穿过密闭空间时发出的声音，这里一片死寂。她在心里默念：小公鸡点到谁我便选谁[1]。叹口气，转向右边，然后吃力地向前走去。隧道口总会通向某个地方吧。【注：[1]原文为“Eeny，meeny，miny，mo”，是英美童谣中经常出现的韵语，并无实在含义。如：“Eeny，Meeny，Miny，Mo /Catch a tiger by the toe/if he hollers， let him go/ Eeny，Meeny，Miny，Mo。”近于“一二三四五，上山打老虎”之类的中国童谣。译者在这里根据上下文将其翻译为“小公鸡点到谁我便选谁”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The landscape was empty except for the track, which wound forward across a wild backdrop. She had left Glasgow far behind, she realised. The horizon was ringed with large, imposing hills. Low-slung clouds blurred their edges as they skimmed the highest peaks. It was a muted palette of colours, purple heather fighting for space amongst great swathes of brown bracken. Small copses of trees grew in irregular patterns on the lower gradients of hills dark-hued with evergreen pines. The slopes closer to the tunnel were gentler, undulating mounds coated with long grass. There was not a town or a road in sight, not even an isolated farmhouse. Dylan bit her lip as she studied the scene. It was untamed and unfriendly looking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁轨蜿蜒向前，消失在一片荒野之中，而此处除了这条铁轨外空空如也。她觉得自己肯定已经离格拉斯哥很远了。地平线上群山环绕，危峰高耸。低压压的云层掠过山顶，茫无涯际。原野上色彩缤纷，紫色的石楠花在一大片棕色的凤尾草中抢占了一席之地，四季常青的松树将山坡下染成深色，低矮的灌木丛杂生其间。靠近隧道的山坡地势平缓，起伏的山丘上百草丰茂。视野里既无市镇也无道路，甚至连一间孤零零的农舍也没有。迪伦一边咬着嘴唇，一边仔细打量着眼前的情景。这里看上去尚是一片不宜久留的蛮荒野地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When at last she exited the tunnel it was raining softly, and she laughed with delight as she turned her face up to the gentle shower. The dark of the tunnel had made her feel dirty, and the misty droplets felt like they were cleansing some of the horrors away. Taking a deep breath, she put her hands on her hips and surveyed her surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终她走出了隧道，外面此时小雨霏霏。她欢笑着仰面对着轻柔的雨点。黑暗的隧道让她有一种不洁的感觉，眼前的蒙蒙细雨似乎洗刷掉了一些讨厌的污秽。她深吸了一口气，双手叉腰，观察起周围的环境来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had expected to see a melee of police cars and ambulances parked at random angles in their haste to get to the scene. There should have been hordes of men and women in different brightly coloured uniforms ready to rush forward and comfort her, check her for injuries and ask her questions. The area just outside the tunnel should have been littered with groups of survivors, ashen-faced and huddled in blankets to keep out the cutting wind. In reality there were none of these things. Her face fell into a mask of confusion and unease. Where was everybody?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她本来还期望看到警车和救护车风驰电掣般赶到现场，横七竖八地停在周围。这里本该有一大群身着各种鲜艳制服的男男女女随时准备冲上前去，对她温言抚慰，检查伤口，还要询问她各种问题。隧道出口的空地上应该随处可见三五成群的幸存者，他们面如死灰，蜷缩在用以抵挡凛冽寒风的毯子里瑟瑟发抖，可现在这些统统没有出现。迪伦的脸上满是困惑和不安，其他人去哪儿了呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turning round, she looked into the black mouth of the tunnel. There was no other explanation: she must have gone the wrong way. They must all be at the other end of the tunnel. Tears of frustration and exhaustion sprang up in her eyes. The thought of going back into the darkness, of having to walk back past the train filled with the limp, lifeless bodies of the less fortunate, was excruciating. But there was no going round it. Hacked out from the base of a massive line of hills, the bracken-covered ground rose up on either side, no less insurmountable than a sheer cliff face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又转身向黑漆漆的隧道口里张望，没有别的解释了：她一定是走错了方向。所有人一定都在隧道的另一头。她的眼中涌出了沮丧疲惫的泪水。一想到重新回到黑暗当中，一想到再次穿过列车，上面满是遇难者软塌塌的死尸，她心里就备受煎熬，可是又没办法绕道走。隧道是从巨大的山坡底部开凿出来的，长满凤尾草的山体在隧道两边巍然耸立，就像悬崖峭壁一样无法穿越。">查看中文翻译</div>

With a quiet sob she turned back to the bleak landscape before her, desperate for some sign of civilisation that would save her from having to return to the dark tunnel. Holding her hand to her forehead to protect her eyes from the wind and the rain, she scanned the horizon. And that was when she saw him.</div>
