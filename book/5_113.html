<div class="line_en">On the day of the recital Marah was so nervous and excited she could barely contain her emotions. As usual, the stress of it all turned her into a pint-sized diva given to jumbo-jet-sized tantrums. Now she stood by the dining room table, one hand on her hip, dressed in faded low-rise jeans and a pink top that read Baby One More Time in rhinestones. An inch of skin showed between the bottom of her shirt and the waistband of her jeans. "Where did you put my butterfly barrettes?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="发表会当天，玛拉既紧张又兴奋，几乎无法控制情绪。因为压力，她变得任性无比，一点小事都会大发脾气，她总是这样。此刻她站在餐桌旁，一手叉着腰，身上穿着褪色低腰牛仔裤和粉红色Ｔ恤，上面用水钻排出“Baby One More Time”字样，裤腰与衣摆之间露出三公分肚皮，“你把我的蝴蝶发卡放哪里了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hunched over the sewing machine, Kate barely glanced up. "They're in your bathroom drawer. Top one. And you're not wearing that top out of the house."</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate shook her head. It wasn't just the recital. Everything with Marah lately was high drama. Her daughter was either giggling and happy or flat-out pissed. Whenever Mom saw her granddaughter she laughed, lit up a smoke, and said, "Oh, the teen years will be fun. You should start drinking before it's too late."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂摇头。不止是因为发表会，最近玛拉总是这么夸张，情绪非常两极，高兴起来就笑个不停，一生气便没完没了。妈妈每次看到外孙女，都会大笑着点起一支烟说：“噢，青春期最精彩，你最好趁早养成酗酒的习惯。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As it turned out, that ended up being the last time she paused for almost two hours. Then, as soon as she'd finished the costumes for the dance recital, she rushed on to her other chores -- finding hangers, packing the car, helping the boys brush their teeth, and breaking up fights. Thankfully Johnny took care of dinner and the dishes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她再次停下来时，已经过了两个小时。做好舞衣之后，她急忙赶着做其他杂事：找衣架、把东西搬上车、帮双胞胎刷牙、制止他们打架。幸好强尼帮忙煮饭、洗碗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate dug through her drawers, found a pair of fairly new black stirrup pants and a thigh-length black and white V-neck sweater. Were stirrup pants still in style? She didn't know. Pulling her hair into a ponytail, she anchored it with a white scrunchie, then brushed her teeth and put on mascara and blush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂翻乱抽屉，找出一条不算太旧的绒布黑色踩脚裤，搭配黑白相间的V领长版上衣。这年头还有人穿踩脚裤吗？她不晓得。她将头发抓成马尾用白色大肠圈绑好，刷过牙，搽上睫毛膏与腮红。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They drove through town and parked at the Island Auditorium. Inside, it was pandemonium: twelve girls between the ages of seven and eleven, their harried parents, dozens of rowdy, disinterested siblings, and Miss Parker, their seventy-year-old dance instructor, who demanded strict propriety at all times and somehow managed to corral this wild bunch without ever raising her voice. Kate carried the costumes into the dressing room, where she helped the girls get ready, bobby-pinned and ponytailed and sprayed their hair, and helped them put on a few touches of mascara and lip gloss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车子驶过市中心，停在岛上的演艺厅外。里面乱得天翻地覆，有年龄介于七岁到十一岁之间的十二个女孩、焦头烂额的家长，还有几十个对发表会毫无兴趣的手足在一旁打打闹闹。舞蹈老师帕克小姐高龄七十了，仪态总是那么严谨端庄，她指挥若定，始终保持轻声细语。凯蒂将舞衣搬进休息室，帮小舞者更衣打扮，帮她们上发卡、绑马尾、喷发胶，最后刷上一些睫毛膏和唇蜜。">查看中文翻译</div>

She looked every inch the aging prima ballerina. "Hello, there," she said in her soft, querulous voice. "As you know, I'm --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灯光闪了几下，观众安静下来，帕克小姐走到舞台中央，穿着粉红色紧身衣与及膝芭蕾舞裙，虽然青春不再，但无损名伶风范。“大家好。”她的声音轻柔但音调略微刺耳，“如各位所知，我——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house lights dimmed and Maggie Levine, dressed as the blue fairy, danced onstage. Her sister, Cleo, and the rest of the girls followed, pirouetting and prancing in what was supposed to be unison. The little ones watched the more experienced dancers intently, executing every movement a second too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="剧场灯光转暗，玛吉·勒凡一身蓝仙子打扮上了舞台，她妹妹克洛伊和其他女生跟着上台旋转、跳跃，动作有些不整齐。几个舞者年纪太小，只能看着姐姐们的动作有样学样，因此总是慢半拍。">查看中文翻译</div>

She couldn't imagine now why she'd thought that, given her background. She ought to have recognized love's scarcity early on. If success were gold, lying in rivers, love was a diamond, buried hundreds of feet beneath the surface of the earth and unrecognizable in its natural form.

Hour by hour, day by day, while politicians and military personnel were looking for bombs and terrorists, and while the Justice Department was tearing down Enron's papery walls, families went on with their ordinary lives.

Torn between the joy of the season and the amount of work that joy required, Kate often had trouble slowing down, remembering to savor the precious moments. There was baking to do -- for the school parties, for the ballet bake sale, for donations at Helper House -- and shopping, of course. As magical as Bainbridge Island was, when it came time to do serious gift-combing, one was reminded forcibly that this was a body of land surrounded by water.
