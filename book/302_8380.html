<div class="line_en">Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been ableto sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. Shewould have been ashamed to look her family in the face the nextmorning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose thanwhen she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure adisgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake thewhole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. She got up with aheadache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding allattempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent enough!</div>

<div class="line_en">The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She playedover every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat atthe instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written outfor her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could begained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied. She spentwhole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voiceoften totally suspended by her tears. In books too, as well as inmusic, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past andpresent was certain of giving. She read nothing but what they had beenused to read together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上，她是怀着同样的心情度过的。她演奏了过去常给威洛比演奏的每一首心爱的歌曲，演奏了他们过去经常同声歌唱的每一支小调，然后坐在钢琴前面，凝视着威洛比给她缮写的每一行琴谱，直至心情悲痛到无以复加的地步。而且，这种伤感的激发天天不断。她可以在钢琴前一坐几个小时，唱唱哭哭，哭哭唱唱，往往泣不成声。她读书和唱歌一样，也总是设法勾起今昔对比给她带来的痛苦。她别的书不读，专读他们过去一起读过的那些书。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; itsunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments, to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why do you not ask Marianne at once," said she, "whether she is or sheis not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind, soindulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would bethe natural result of your affection for her. She used to be allunreserve, and to you more especially."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你为什么不马上问问玛丽安，”她说，“看她是不是真和威洛比订婚了？你是做母亲的，对她那么仁慈，那么宽容，提出这个问题是不会惹她冒火的。这是很自然的，你这样钟爱她。她过去一向十分坦率，对你尤其如此。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possiblethat they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiryinflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should neverdeserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession ofwhat is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I knowMarianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall notbe the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances makethe revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force theconfidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of dutywould prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我无论如何也不能问这样的问题。假使他们真的没有订婚，我这么一问会引起多大的痛苦啊！不管怎样，这样做太不体贴人了。人家现在不想告诉任何人的事儿，我却去硬逼着她坦白，那就休想再得到她的信任。我懂得玛丽安的心！我知道她十分爱我，一旦条件成熟，她决不会最后一个向我透露真情。我不想逼迫任何人向我交心，更不想逼迫自己的孩子向我交心，因为出于一种义务感，本来不想说的事情也要说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister'syouth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, commoncare, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romanticdelicacy.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned beforeMarianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, werenot so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour; -- butone evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume ofShakespeare, exclaimed,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天之后，达什伍德家才有人在玛丽安面前提起威洛比的名字。确实，约翰爵士和詹宁斯太太并不那么体贴人，他们那些俏皮话曾多次让玛丽安心里痛上加痛。不过，有天晚上，达什伍德太太无意中拿起一本莎士比亚的书，大声嚷道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne wasprevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead ofwandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided everycompanion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on thedowns, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of thevalley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never befound when the others set off. But at length she was secured by theexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion. They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence, for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied withgaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the entrance ofthe valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild andmore open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on firstcoming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, theystopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed thedistance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they hadnever happened to reach in any of their walks before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早晨，大约在威洛比离开乡下一个星期之后，玛丽安终于被说服了，没有独自溜走，而同意与姐姐妹妹一道去散步。迄今为止，每当外出闲逛时，她总是小心翼翼地避开别人。如果姐姐妹妹想到高地上散步，她就径直朝小路上溜掉；如果她们说去山谷，她就一溜烟往山上跑去，姐妹俩还没抬步，她已经跑得无影无踪。埃丽诺极不赞成她总是这样避开他人，最后终于把她说服了。她们顺着山谷一路走去，大部分时间都沉默不语，这一方面因为玛丽安心绪难平，一方面因为埃丽诺已经满足于刚刚取得的一点进展，不想多所希求。山谷入口处，虽然土质依然很肥，却并非野草丛生，因而显得更加开阔。入口处外边，长长的一段路呈现在眼前，她们初来巴顿时走的就是这条路。一来到入口处，便停下脚步四处眺望。以前在乡舍里，这儿是她们举目远眺的尽头，现在站在一个过去散步时从未到达的地点，仔细观看这里的景色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne fromparticularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon within thirtyyards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart sunk withinher; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voicesof both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as wellknown as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and sheturned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一边说，一边迫不及待地往前走去。埃丽诺几乎可以肯定，来人不是威洛比，为了不让玛丽安过于亲昵，她加快脚步，追了上去。转眼间，她们离那位绅士不过三十码远了。玛丽安再定睛一看，不觉凉了半截，只见她忽地转过身，匆匆往回奔去。正当姐妹两人提高嗓门喊她站住的时候，又听到一个声音，几乎和威洛比的嗓音一样熟悉，也跟着恳求她止步。玛丽安惊奇地转过身，一见是爱德华。费拉斯，连忙上前欢迎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially byMarianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him thaneven Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edwardand her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldnesswhich she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour. OnEdward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that alover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neitherrapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him byquestions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Mariannesaw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel adislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, bycarrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed acontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他受到她们大家极其热烈的欢迎，特别是玛丽安，接待起来甚至比埃丽诺还热情周到。的确，在玛丽安看来，爱德华和姐姐的这次相会不过是一种不可思议的冷漠关系的继续。她在诺兰庄园从他们的相互态度中经常注意到这种冷漠关系。尤其是爱德华一方，他在这种场合完全缺乏一个恋人应有的言谈举止。他慌里慌张的，见到她们似乎并不觉得高兴，看上去既不狂喜也不快活。他少言寡语，只是问到了，才不得不敷衍两句，对埃丽诺毫无特别亲热的表示。玛丽安耳闻目睹，越来越感到惊讶。她几乎有点厌恶爱德华了，而这种反感与她的其他感情一样，最终都要使她回想到威洛比，他的仪态与他未来的连襟形成了鲜明的对照。">查看中文翻译</div>
