<div class="line_en">Thus amusing himself with fancies, he came to the field. There he stopped to see if, by any chance, a vine filled with gold coins was in sight. But he saw nothing! He took a few steps forward, and still nothing! He stepped into the field. He went up to the place where he had dug the hole and buried the gold pieces. Again nothing! Pinocchio became very thoughtful and, forgetting his good manners altogether, he pulled a hand out of his pocket and gave his head a thorough scratching.</div>

<div class="line_en">And as he walked with hurried steps, his heart beat with an excited tic, tac, tic, tac, just as if it were a wall clock, and his busy brain kept thinking:</div>

<div class="line_en">"What if, instead of a thousand, I should find two thousand? Or if, instead of two thousand, I should find five thousand -- or one hundred thousand? I'll build myself a beautiful palace, with a thousand stables filled with a thousand wooden horses to play with, a cellar overflowing with lemonade and ice cream soda, and a library of candies and fruits, cakes and cookies."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时候，他耳朵里好像听到了大笑声。他抬头一看，只见一棵树上有只大鹦鹉，正在理它身上稀稀拉拉的羽毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Marionette did not answer. He walked to the brook, filled his shoe with water, and once more sprinkled the ground which covered the gold pieces.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I certainly do mean you, poor Pinocchio -- you who are such a little silly as to believe that gold can be sown in a field just like beans or squash. I, too, believed that once and today I am very sorry for it. Today (but too late!) I have reached the conclusion that, in order to come by money honestly, one must work and know how to earn it with hand or brain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，我说你，可怜的皮诺乔，我说你是个大胡涂虫，竟相信金币可以像豆子南瓜那样在田野上播种收获。我曾经也相信过一次，到如今都觉得后悔。如今（可惜太晚了！）我确信，要正直地挣到一点钱，必须懂得用自己的手劳动，或者用自己的头脑思索。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Too bad! I'll explain myself better," said the Parrot. "While you were away in the city the Fox and the Cat returned here in a great hurry. They took the four gold pieces which you have buried and ran away as fast as the wind. If you can catch them, you're a brave one!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没法子！我只好说得更明白些，”鹦鹉往下说。“你要知道，当你在城里的时候，狐狸和猫回到这块地里来，挖走了金币，像阵风似地溜掉了。如今要追上它们，已经办不到啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In desperation, he ran to the city and went straight to the courthouse to report the robbery to the magistrate.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pinocchio's mouth opened wide. He would not believe the Parrot's words and began to dig away furiously at the earth. He dug and he dug till the hole was as big as himself, but no money was there. Every penny was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮诺乔就那么张大了嘴闭不拢来。他不愿意相信鹏纽的话，开始用手指甲挖浇过水的土。他挖啊，挖啊，挖了很深很深的一个大坑，连一个稻草堆都可以放进去了，可就是找不到金币。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Judge was a Monkey, a large Gorilla venerable with age. A flowing white beard covered his chest and he wore gold-rimmed spectacles from which the glasses had dropped out. The reason for wearing these, he said, was that his eyes had been weakened by the work of many years.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Judge listened to him with great patience. A kind look shone in his eyes. He became very much interested in the story; he felt moved; he almost wept. When the Marionette had no more to say, the Judge put out his hand and rang a bell.</div>

<div class="line_en">There he had to remain for four long, weary months. And if it had not been for a very lucky chance, he probably would have had to stay there longer. For, my dear children, you must know that it happened just then that the young emperor who ruled over the City of Simple Simons had gained a great victory over his enemy, and in celebration thereof, he had ordered illuminations, fireworks, shows of all kinds, and, best of all, the opening of all prison doors.</div>
