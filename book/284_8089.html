<div class="line_en">Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her imagination. There is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it had given her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood, so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things. Already she felt less "contrary," though she did not know why.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over, and thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things. All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The thought of that pleased her very much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看着那把钥匙很久。她把它翻来覆去，思量着它。就像我前面说过的，她这个孩子不曾有人教她要取得准许，或者遇事要问大人。对这把钥匙，她想的只有它是不是通往那个上锁的花园，她能不能找到门在哪里，她也许可以打开门，看墙里面是什么，那些陈年的玫瑰树都怎么样了。正因为它被紧闭多年，她更想去看看。似乎那一定与其他地方不同，十年里里面一定有奇异的事情发生。除此之外，如果她喜欢它，还可以每天进去，把门在背后关上，她可以自己发明玩法，一个人玩，因为没有人知道她在哪里，还以为门仍然锁着，钥匙仍然埋在地下。这个想法让她很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I got up at four o'clock," she said. "Eh! it was pretty on th' moor with th' birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sun risin'. I didn't walk all th' way. A man gave me a ride in his cart an' I did enjoy myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No one but herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much disappointed. Something of her contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so silly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把钥匙放到口袋了，沿着走道走来走去。除了她自己，这里似乎从无人来，所以她可以慢慢走，看着墙，或者不如说，看着墙上长的常春藤。常春藤是让人迷惑的东西。无论她看得如何仔细，除了密密麻麻的、光滑的墨绿叶片，她什么也看不见。她相当失望。她在走道上踱着步，看着那里面的树梢，那么一股别扭劲儿又上来了。这真是愚蠢，她心想，近在咫尺却进不去。回房子的时候，她把钥匙放在口袋里带着。她决定出去时总是带上钥匙，这样一旦她发现了隐藏的门，她随时做好了准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

She counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was more interested than she had ever been since she was born. The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing -- not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping about him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a curious expression. She had wondered if he would notice her. She wanted him to see her skip.</div>

At length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She did not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the robin she laughed again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽围着所有的花园，又围着果园跳，几分钟休息一下。最后她来到自己的特别走道，决定试试看能不能跳完全程。这段路好长，她起得慢，然而没跳到一半，她又热又气紧，被迫停下来。她不太在乎，因为她已经数到三十了。她停下来，发出一声愉快的轻笑，那里，快瞧呀看呀，知更鸟随着一枝长长的常春藤摇曳。它刚刚跟踪了她，用一声短啼向她问好。玛丽朝它跳去，觉得每跳一下，口袋里有重物打一下，当她看到知更鸟，她又笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

"He followed after thee yesterday. He'll be at it again today. He'll be bound to find out what th' skippin'-rope is. He's never seen one. Eh!" shaking his head at the bird, "tha' curiosity will be th' death of thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你接着练，”老季说，“就你和不信上帝的人一起呆过，你的身体算好的，能够跳绳。瞧它怎么观察你，”他把头朝知更鸟一甩，“昨天它跟踪你。今天还要跟。这下它可发誓要弄清楚跳绳是什么东西。它从来没见过。啊！”对小鸟摇头，“你要是不加倍留心，有一天你的好奇心会送了你的命。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand. This she did because she had seen something under it -- a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it. It was the knob of a door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一道那种可爱的小小阵风沿走道扫过来，要比别的阵风强。强得足以摇动树枝，更足以摇摆墙上拖下的一蓬蓬未修剪的常春藤。玛丽已经走近知更鸟，突然那阵风把一些蓬松的常春藤条拂到一边，玛丽更加突然地往前一跳，把什么抓在手里。她这么做是因为她看到下面有东西——一个圆形的手柄，一直被挂在上面的叶子盖住。这是门把手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off -- and they are nearly always doing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="知更鸟从它那蓬摇曳的常春藤枝条飞上墙头，张开喙，响亮地发出一道可爱的颤音，纯为炫耀。世界上没有什么比炫耀的知更鸟更让人倾慕了——它们几乎随时随地在炫耀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if any one was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come, it seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not help it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly -- slowly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她深吸一口气，看背后走道那头有没有人来。没有人来，看来如此，她又深吸一口气，因为她实在忍不住，她把摇荡的常春藤帘子往后抓着，朝后推那道门，门慢慢、慢慢地——开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.</div>

<div class="line_en">She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside. Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood and iron. Mary's heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement. The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side, as if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?</div>
