<div class="line_en">Dawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a misty, haunted air. My head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood.</div>

<div class="line_en">My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable, with Prim emaciated and terrified. I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of light.</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me. Then I'm deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. At least my blood is flowing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慢慢地，我从床上爬起来，走进浴室。我随意按下控制板上的按钮，一股冰凉的水流和一股滚烫的水流交替从我的脚下喷出来，接着柠檬味的泡沫浴液把我淹没，我不得不用硬毛刷把它刷掉。噢，好吧，至少我的血流加快了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I'm dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. Tight black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and leather shoes. I put my hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself. No fancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like I could be headed for the woods. It calms me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我擦干身子，抹上润肤露，从浴室出来时，发现衣橱最外侧已经准备好了一套衣服。紧身黑裤、长袖勃艮第束腰外衣和皮鞋。我梳起一根长辫。从收获节仪式的那天早上到现在，我还是第一次打扮得比较像平时的自己。没有奇异的发式和服装，没有燃烧的斗篷。就是我，看上去就要去树林子里的样子，这让我觉得很踏实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must be up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. Prim milking her goat before school. Just two mornings ago, I was home. Can that be right? Yes, just two. And now how empty the house feels, even from a distance. What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的思绪又飞回到妈妈和波丽姆那里。她们肯定已经起床了。妈妈正在准备玉米粥，做早餐，波丽姆上学前要给羊挤奶。两天前。我还在家里。这时真的吗？是的，就两天。可现在家里显得空荡荡的，即使远在这里也能感觉到。有关我昨天在火光中的开场，她们又说了些什么？当她们看到围成一圈的二十四个选手，只有一个能够存活时，这一切为她们增添的希望还是加重了恐惧？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haymitch didn't give us an exact time to meet for breakfast and no one has contacted me this morning, but I'm hungry so I head down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. I'm not disappointed. While the table is empty, a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young man, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. When I ask if I can serve myself, he nods assent. I load a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slices of pale purple melon. As I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise over the Capitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table, breaking off bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way Peeta did on the train.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑密斯没有给我们定早饭见面的具体时间，今早也没人跟我联系。我已饿了，就自顾自地来到餐厅，希望能有饭吃。我没有失望，中间的餐桌上没有摆放食品，可靠边的长桌上却摆着至少二十道菜。一个年轻的男艾瓦克斯恭敬地站在桌旁。我问他是否可以自取食物时，他点点头。于是我在餐盘上放入鸡蛋、香肠、铺着厚厚一层橘子蜜饯的蛋糕、淡紫色的香瓜片。我边大嚼着食物，边看着太阳在凯匹特上空冉冉升起。我又盛了一盘浇着炖牛肉的热米饭。最后，盛满一盘蛋卷，坐在桌旁，把蛋卷一点点撕开，沾着热巧克力吃，跟皮塔在火车上的吃法一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table. "So, let's get down to business. Training. First off, if you like, I'll coach you separately. Decide now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑密斯吃完了几盘炖菜，他叹口气把盘子从面前推开，从衣袋里拿出一个长颈瓶子，长长地吸了一口，然后把臂肘靠在桌子上。“那么，咱么说正事吧。训练。如果你们愿意，可以退出，我对你们进行个别训练。现在就决定。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm nervous about the training. There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon, we'll each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers. The thought of meeting the other tributes face-to-face makes me queasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即将开始的训练让我感到紧张。在三天的时间里，所有的“贡品”将会一起训练。到最后一天的下午，我们可以在竞赛组织者面前进行私下演练。一想到要和其他选手面对面训练，我就觉得心神不宁。我把刚从篮子里拿来的蛋卷在手指转来转去，已经没有胃口了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am. I need to say something to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow up in our faces once the Games begin. Surely, they must know this. Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it was anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after last night's triumph, I don't have a lot of room to criticize his choices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑密斯和皮塔来了，问过好，然后在盘子里盛满食物。皮塔的服装竟然和一模一样，这让我恼火。我得跟西纳说说这事。猎杀游戏一开始，我们这种双胞胎似的着装肯定会让我们尴尬无比。很肯定，他们必须知道这一点。接着我又想起黑密斯让我们完全听从设计师的安排。我很想不理会他的话，可经历了昨晚的成功，我对他的选择似乎也无可厚非。">查看中文翻译</div>

Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but don't reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes. The plan's the same for both of you. You go to group training. Spend the time trying to learn something you don't know. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what you're best at until your private sessions. Are we clear?" says Haymitch.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends! Talking up each other's strengths, insisting the other take credit for their abilities.

Who, by the way, clearly doesn't want to be partnering up with me, either.</div>

Experts in each skill will remain at their stations. We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose, per our mentor's instructions.

It's the first time we've been assembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am, even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my family's resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I nod. I don't know why I said anything at all. Although if I'm going to lose, I'd rather Peeta win than the others. Better for our district, for my mother and Prim.</div>

<div class="line_en">After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. Instantly, I know I'm in trouble. They've been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too much wine, most of them. Want more than anything to go home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约过了十五分钟，有人叫我的名字。我整整头发，伸直腰板，走进体育馆。刚一进去，就觉得不妙。大赛组织者已经测试了二十三个区的选手，他们在这里耗时过长，多数人又喝了酒，此时他们已心情涣散，归家心切了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I've been itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I can't even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. There's a shooting range, but it's much too limited. Standard bull's-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong. The string's tighter than the one I use at home. The arrow's more rigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a moment, I'm humiliated, then I head back to the bull's-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对此，我束手无策，只能硬着头皮按原计划进行。我走到摆放弓箭的站点。噢，弓箭！我的手已经痒了好几天了。各种弓箭用木头、塑料、金属，还有一些我叫不上名字的材料制成。箭的尾羽一水儿切割得齐刷刷的。我挑了把弓箭，将配套的箭袋搭在肩上。射箭的距离已经预设好，但距离太近了。靶子是标准的十环人像靶。于是我走到训练场中心，瞄准我的第一个目标――用来练习刀法的假人。我拉弓的时候，发现不太对劲，弓弦比我在家所用的要紧，箭也更硬，结果我差几英寸没有射中假人。观众席上本来没几个注意我，这时大家更是心不在焉了。一时间，我觉得很丢脸。我回到人像靶的射箭位置，一连射了很多次，直到我掌握了使用新武器的要领。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又回到训练场中心原来的位置，拉满弓，一箭射穿了假人的心脏，紧接着，又射中了悬挂拳击沙袋的绳子，沙袋撞击地面，啪地一下裂开了。我没停顿，在地上一滚，接着单腿跪地，又是一箭，射中了高挂在训练场上方的聚光灯，打得聚光灯火花四溅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they don't even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I'm being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers' table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pig's mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我猛然间怒火中烧。现在我命悬一线，可这些人却对我不理不睬，我甚至比不上一头死猪。我心砰砰地跳着，连涨得通红。我不假思索，从箭袋中抽出一只箭，直射向大赛组织者所坐的桌子。接着听到声声惊叫，那些人赶紧跌跌撞撞地往后退。箭正好射中烤猪嘴里的苹果，一下子连箭带苹果子钉在了后面的墙上。每个人都用困惑不解的眼光看着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you for your consideration," I say. Then I give a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being dismissed.</div>
