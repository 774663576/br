<div class="line_en">It was the day after this that Waddington, coming to the bungalow in the afternoon, when he had sat a little asked Kitty if she would not go for a stroll with him. She had not been out of the compound since their arrival. She was glad enough.</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked up the hill till they came to the archway. It was richly carved. Fantastic and ironical it stood like a landmark in the surrounding country. They sat down on the pedestal and faced the wide plain. The hill was sown close with the little green mounds of the dead, not in lines but disorderly, so that you felt that beneath the surface they must strangely jostle one another. The narrow causeway meandered sinuously among the green rice-fields. A small boy seated on the neck of a water-buffalo drove it slowly home, and three peasants in wide straw hats lolloped with sidelong gait under their heavy loads. After the heat of the day it was pleasant in that spot to catch the faint breeze of the evening and the wide expanse of country brought a sense of restful melancholy to the tortured heart. But Kitty could not rid her mind of the dead beggar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一步也没停，一直来到了拱门底下。拱门上面雕刻着华丽的花纹，它矗立在这块土地上，俨然一座纪念碑，然而巍然之中隐含着某种讽刺意味。他们在拱门底座上坐了下来，面对着一望无际的原野。山上遍布着绿草茵茵的坟包，它们并不是井井有条地排成行列，而是相互交错在一起，让人感觉它们的主人在地下也是横躺竖卧，不得安宁。狭窄的堤道在翠绿的稻田中蜿蜒而行。一个小男孩正骑在水牛颈子上，慢悠悠地赶牛回家。三个农民头戴宽大的草帽，各自肩上背着一垛庄稼，歪歪斜斜地走着路。偶尔会吹来傍晚的微风，在熬过了中午的酷暑之后，自然让人感到格外惬意。乡村广袤的原野在眼前铺展开去，使人备感松弛，甚至会勾起莫名的伤感。凯蒂长久以来饱受折磨的心头得到了疏解，但是她难以忘掉那个死去的乞丐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她透过睫毛斜着瞥了他一眼，嘴角浅浅地笑了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When they telegraphed to me that you were coming with Fane I was astonished. But then it occurred to me that perhaps you'd been a nurse and all this sort of thing was in the day's work. I expected you to be one of those grim-visaged females who lead you a dog's life when you're ill in hospital. You could have knocked me down with a feather when I came into the bungalow and saw you sitting down and resting. You looked very frail and white and tired."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们给我拍来电报以后，我得知你也会跟费恩一起前来，这很让我吃惊。随后我想你可能是一位护士，白天的工作也有你的份儿。我把你想成是那种板起一副面孔的女人，谁要是进了医院，她能叫你要死要活的。我进了房子看见你坐在那里休息，差点没昏过去。你当时看上去已经筋疲力尽，脸色苍白，虚弱得不得了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="韦丁顿盯着她看，两只蓝眼睛闪闪放光。显然他认为凯蒂的话经不住推敲。不过既然他不明说，她也装作若无其事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry you don't like my expression. The only reason I have for looking unhappy is that since I was twelve I've known that my nose was a little too long. But to cherish a secret sorrow is a most effective pose: you can't think how many sweet young men have wanted to console me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很抱歉你不喜欢我的脸色。我看上去忧郁的唯一原因是，从十二岁起，我知道了我的鼻子长得有点长。但是暗自神伤可是最能捕获人心的办法，你不知道有多少英俊少年试图安慰我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I knew that you hadn't been married very long and I came to the conclusion that you and your husband were madly in love with each other. I couldn't believe that he had wished you to come, but perhaps you had absolutely refused to stay behind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道你们结婚时间不长，我得出结论，认为你们彼此深爱对方。所以，如果说是他希望你来，我是不会相信的。很有可能的是，你断然拒绝一个人留在香港。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，但并不正确。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She waited for him to go on, fearful of what he was about to say, for she had a pretty good idea of his shrewdness and was aware that he never hesitated to speak his mind, but unable to resist the desire to hear him talk about herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I respect him. He has brains and character; and that, I may tell you, is a very unusual combination. I don't suppose you know what he is doing here, because I don't think he's very expansive with you. If any man single-handed can put a stop to this frightful epidemic he's going to do it. He's doctoring the sick, cleaning the city up, trying to get the drinking water pure. He doesn't mind where he goes nor what he does. He's risking his life twenty times a day. He's got Colonel Yü in his pocket and he's induced him to put the troops at his disposal. He's even put a little pluck into the magistrate and the old man is really trying to do something. And the nuns at the convent swear by him. They think he's a hero."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我尊敬他。他既有头脑又有个性。我可以跟你说，这两者能够结合到一个人的身上很不寻常。我看到他不是很喜欢和你搭话，所以我感觉你不清楚他在这儿每天都在干什么。如果说谁能够单枪匹马扑灭这场恐怖的瘟疫，他就将是那个人。他每天医治病人，清理城市，竭尽全力把人们喝的水弄干净。他根本不在乎他去的地方、做的事儿是不是危险，一天之内有二十回跟死神打交道。余团长对他言听计从，把军队交给他调遣。他甚至让那位治安官也看到了希望，这老头现在决定干点什么。修道院里的那群修女崇拜他，把他当成英雄。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我对你们俩如何相处很感兴趣。有时我很想知道你们单独在一起时会是什么样。我在的时候你们都在装样子，两人都是。可惜你们的表演糟透了，老天。要是去了巡回剧院，就算你们拼上性命，一个礼拜也赚不到三十先令。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"After all this isn't his job, is it? He's a bacteriologist. There was no call for him to come here. He doesn't give me the impression that he's moved by compassion for all these dying Chinamen. Watson was different. He loved the human race. Though he was a missionary it didn't make any difference to him if they were Christian, Buddhist or Confucian; they were just human beings. Your husband isn't here because he cares a damn if a hundred thousand Chinese die of cholera; he isn't here either in the interests of science. Why is he here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说到底这并不是他的工作，不是吗？他是个细菌学家。谁也没有叫他来，以他给我的印象，他也不是出于对这些濒死的中国人的同情。维森和他不一样。他热爱整个人类，虽然他是个传教士，但是在他眼里，人们没有基督徒、佛教徒、儒教徒之分，他们都是人。你的丈夫来这儿不是因为他不忍看到十万中国人死于霍乱，也不是为了研究他的细菌。他到底因为什么来这儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道。我不知道是你惹他厌烦，以至于你离他近点儿他就会浑身起鸡皮疙瘩，还是他太爱你了，由于某种原因而将他的爱埋藏起来。我曾经问过自己，你们到这儿是不是双双自杀来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
