<div class="line_en">Except for a handful of days, Rasheed didn't observe the fast. The few times he did, he came home in a sour mood. Hunger made him curt, irritable, impatient. One night, Mariam was a few minutes late with dinner, and he started eating bread with radishes. Even after Mariam put the rice and the lamb and okra qurma in front of him, he wouldn't touch it. He said nothing, and went on chewing the bread, his temples working, the vein on his forehead, full and angry. He went on chewing and staring ahead, and when Mariam spoke to him he looked at her without seeing her face and put another piece of bread into his mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ramadan came in the fall that year, 1974. For the first time in her life, Mariam saw how the sighting of the new crescent moon could transform an entire city, alter its rhythm and mood. She noticed a drowsy hush overtaking Kabul. Traffic became languid, scant, even quiet. Shops emptied. Restaurants turned off their lights, closed their doors. Mariam saw no smokers on the streets, no cups of tea steaming from window ledges. And at iftar, when the sun dipped in the west and the cannon fired from the Shir Darwaza mountain, the city broke its fast, and so did Mariam, with bread and a date, tasting for the first time in her fifteen years the sweetness of sharing in a communal experience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年——也就是1974年——秋天，斋月来临。有生以来，玛丽雅姆第一次看到新月初升如何影响到整座城市，改变了它的节奏和气氛。她注意到一片寂静接管了喀布尔。路上的行人变得无精打采，零零落落，甚至还很安静。商铺空无一人。饭店关掉电灯，大门紧闭。玛丽雅姆看到马路上没有人吸烟，窗架上也没有冒着袅袅水汽的茶杯。每当太阳西下，雪达瓦扎山的大炮响起，便到了开斋时分，此时这座城市的斋戒就会中止，玛丽雅姆也开始进食，吃一点面包和枣椰子，十五岁的她第一次尝到和他人分享一种共同文化的甜蜜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mullah Faizullah would come too. He would bring Mariam chocolate candy wrapped in foil, a basketful of dyed boiled eggs, cookies. After he was gone, Mariam would climb one of the willows with her treats. Perched on a high branch, she would eat Mullah Faizullah's chocolates and drop the foil wrappers until they lay scattered about the trunk of the tree like silver blossoms. When the chocolate was gone, she would start in on the cookies, and, with a pencil, she would draw faces on the eggs he had brought her now. But there was little pleasure in this for her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rasheed and she took to the streets. Mariam had never walked amid such liveliness. Undaunted by the chilly weather, families had flooded the city on their frenetic rounds to visit relatives. On their own street, Mariam saw Fariba and her son Noor, who was dressed in a suit. Fariba, wearing a white scarf, walked beside a small-boned, shy-looking man with eyeglasses. Her older son was there too -- Mariam somehow remembered Fariba saying his name, Ahmad, at the tandoor that first time. He had deep-set, brooding eyes, and his face was more thoughtful, more solemn, than his younger brother's, a face as suggestive of early maturity as his brother's was of lingering boyishness. Around Ahmad's neck was a glittering ALLAH pendant.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went to Shar-e-Nau, where kids romped about in new shirts and beaded, brightly colored vests and compared Eid gifts. Women brandished platters of sweets. Mariam saw festive lanterns hanging from shopwindows, heard music blaring from loudspeakers. Strangers called out "Eid mubarak" to her as they passed.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night they went to Chaman, and, standing behind Rasheed, Mariam watched fireworks light up the sky, in flashes of green, pink, and yellow. She missed sitting with Mullah Faizullah outside the kolba, watching the fireworks explode over Herat in the distance, the sudden bursts of color reflected in her tutor's soft, cataract-riddled eyes. But, mostly, she missed Nana. Mariam wished her mother were alive to see this. To see her, amid all of it. To see at last that contentment and beauty were not unattainable things. Even for the likes of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">THEY HAD Eid visitors at the house. They were all men, friends of Rasheed's. When a knock came, Mariam knew to go upstairs to her room and close the door.

<div class="line_en">On the third and last day of Eid, Rasheed went to visit some friends. Mariam, who'd had a queasy stomach all night, boiled some water and made herself a cup of green tea sprinkled with crushed cardamom. In the living room, she took in the aftermath of the previous night's Eid visits: the overturned cups, the half-chewed pumpkin seeds stashed between mattresses, the plates crusted with the outline of last night's meal.

<div class="line_cn" title="她本来没想到要走进拉希德的房间。但她从客厅打扫到楼梯，接着又清理了楼上的走廊，来到了他门口。神差鬼使地，她第一次走进了他的房间，坐在他的床铺上，感觉自己擅闯了别人的地盘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She saw the gun first. It was black, with a wooden grip and a short muzzle. Mariam made sure to memorize which way it was facing before she picked it up. She turned it over in her hands. It was much heavier than it looked. The grip felt smooth in her hand, and the muzzle was cold. It was disquieting to her that Rasheed owned something whose sole purpose was to kill another person. But surely he kept it for their safety. Her safety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最先映入她眼帘的是一把手枪。它是黑色的，木质的枪柄，短短的枪管。在拿起枪之前，玛丽雅姆确保自己记住了它是怎么摆放的。她双手来回拿着这把枪。它比看上去要重一点。手里握着的枪柄很滑，枪管则是冷冰冰的。想到拉希德居然拥有这种惟一的用途就是杀害其他人的东西，她忐忑不安起来。但他持有这把枪，肯定是为了他们的安全。为了她的安全。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took in the heavy, green drapes, the pairs of polished shoes lined up neatly along the wall, the closet door, where the gray paint had chipped and showed the wood beneath. She spotted a pack of cigarettes atop the dresser beside his bed. She put one between her lips and stood before the small oval mirror on the wall. She puffed air into the mirror and made ash-tapping motions. She put it back. She could never manage the seamless grace with which Kabuli women smoked. On her, it looked coarse, ridiculous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她依次看见两面厚重的绿色窗帘，几双光亮的皮鞋在墙边整齐地一字排开，衣柜的柜门，上面的油漆已经剥落，露出里面的木头。她还看到他床边的梳妆台上有一包香烟。她抽出一根，放在双唇之间，站在墙上椭圆形的小镜子前面。她朝镜子吐了一口气，假装敲了敲烟灰。她把香烟放回去。她学不来喀布尔的女人吸烟时那种流畅而优美的动作。她自己吸烟的样子看上去很粗俗，很荒唐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On every page were women, beautiful women, who wore no shirts, no trousers, no socks or underpants. They wore nothing at all. They lay in beds amid tumbled sheets and gazed back at Mariam with half-lidded eyes. In most of the pictures, their legs were apart, and Mariam had a full view of the dark place between. In some, the women were prostrated as if -- God forbid this thought -- in sujda for prayer. They looked back over their shoulders with a look of bored contempt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam quickly put the magazine back where she'd found it. She felt drugged. Who were these women? How could they allow themselves to be photographed this way? Her stomach revolted with distaste. Was this what he did then, those nights that he did not visit her room? Had she been a disappointment to him in this particular regard? And what about all his talk of honor and propriety, his disapproval of the female customers, who, after all, were only showing him their feet to get fitted for shoes? A woman's face, he'd said, is her husband's business only. Surely the women on these pages had husbands, some of them must. At the least, they had brothers. If so, why did Rasheed insist that she cover when he thought nothing of looking at the private areas of other men's wives and sisters?</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, an explanation presented itself. He was a man, after all, living alone for years before she had moved in. His needs differed from hers. For her, all these months later, their coupling was still an exercise in tolerating pain. His appetite, on the other hand, was fierce, sometimes bordering on the violent.

<div class="line_cn" title="正是在这个抽屉里面，她看到了那个叫尤纳斯的男孩的照片。那是一张黑白相片。他看上去只有四岁，也许五岁。照片中的他穿着条纹衬衣，系着蝴蝶结。他是英俊的小男孩，鼻子笔挺，棕色的头发，稍微有点凹陷的眼珠黑黝黝的。他看上去有点分心，好像相机闪光的时候有什么东西引起了他的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beneath that, Mariam found another photo, also black and-white, this one slightly more grainy. It was of a seated woman and, behind her, a thinner, younger Rasheed, with black hair. The woman was beautiful. Not as beautiful as the women in the magazine, perhaps, but beautiful. Certainly more beautiful than her, Mariam. She had a delicate chin and long, black hair parted in the center. High cheekbones and a gentle forehead. Mariam pictured her own face, her thin lips and long chin, and felt a flicker of jealousy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相片下面，玛丽雅姆又看到另外一张，也是黑白的，比起上一张，它稍微有点模糊。照片中是一个坐着的女人，她后面则是拉希德，一头黑发，比现在瘦一点，也更年轻。那个女人很漂亮。可能没有杂志里面的女人漂亮，但是挺好看的。当然比她玛丽雅姆好看多了。她的下巴很精致，黑色的长发从中间分开。高高的颧骨，柔美的额头。玛丽雅姆想起了自己的脸庞，想起了她那薄薄的嘴唇和长长的下巴，她心中闪过一丝妒忌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What Mariam felt now, as the loaded clotheslines bounced heavily before her, was sorrow for Rasheed. He too had had a hard life, a life marked by loss and sad turns of fate. Her thoughts returned to his boy Yunus, who had once built snowmen in this yard, whose feet had pounded these same stairs. The lake had snatched him from Rasheed, swallowed him up, just as a whale had swallowed the boy's namesake prophet in the Koran. It pained Mariam -- it pained her considerably -- to picture Rasheed panic-stricken and helpless, pacing the banks of the lake and pleading with it to spit his son back onto dry land.</div>
