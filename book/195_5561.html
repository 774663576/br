<div class="line_en">The following Saturday Mildred returned, and that evening Philip kept her to himself. He took seats for the play, and they drank champagne at dinner. It was her first gaiety in London for so long that she enjoyed everything ingenuously. She cuddled up to Philip when they drove from the theatre to the room he had taken for her in Pimlico.</div>

<div class="line_en">But presently he appeared. He was a handsome creature, tall and thin; his head was placed well on the body, it gave him a conquering air which was attractive; and his curly hair, his bold, friendly blue eyes, his red mouth, were charming. Philip saw Mildred look at him with appreciation, and he felt a curious satisfaction. Griffiths greeted them with a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话音刚落，格里菲斯就出现了。他长得好看，又高又瘦，英俊的脑袋配上他宽阔的肩膀，看上去神气极了。卷卷的头发、大而温柔的蓝色眼睛、鲜红的嘴唇，怎么看都觉得迷人。菲利普发现米尔德里德正用欣赏的表情看着他，竟有种莫名的自豪感。格里菲斯笑了笑，算是和他们打了招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Griffiths was in the best possible humour, for, having at length passed his final examination, he was qualified, and he had just been appointed house-surgeon at a hospital in the North of London. He was taking up his duties at the beginning of May and meanwhile was going home for a holiday; this was his last week in town, and he was determined to get as much enjoyment into it as he could. He began to talk the gay nonsense which Philip admired because he could not copy it. There was nothing much in what he said, but his vivacity gave it point. There flowed from him a force of life which affected everyone who knew him; it was almost as sensible as bodily warmth. Mildred was more lively than Philip had ever known her, and he was delighted to see that his little party was a success. She was amusing herself enormously. She laughed louder and louder. She quite forgot the genteel reserve which had become second nature to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed an added charm in Griffiths that he liked Philip. They were all sober people, and the wine they had drunk went to their heads. Griffiths became more talkative and so boisterous that Philip, amused, had to beg him to be quiet. He had a gift for story-telling, and his adventures lost nothing of their romance and their laughter in his narration. He played in all of them a gallant, humorous part. Mildred, her eyes shining with excitement, urged him on. He poured out anecdote after anecdote. When the lights began to be turned out she was astonished.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next day, when they were having tea, Griffiths came in. He sank lazily into an arm-chair. There was something strangely sensual in the slow movements of his large limbs. Philip remained silent, while the others chattered away, but he was enjoying himself. He admired them both so much that it seemed natural enough for them to admire one another. He did not care if Griffiths absorbed Mildred's attention, he would have her to himself during the evening: he had something of the attitude of a loving husband, confident in his wife's affection, who looks on with amusement while she flirts harmlessly with a stranger. But at half past seven he looked at his watch and said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，菲利普和米尔德里德正喝着茶呢，格里菲斯进来了。他懒洋洋地瘫在扶手椅上，壮实的四肢慢悠悠地伸展开来，散发着莫名的性感风情。菲利普一句话都没说，可另外两个人早就热火朝天地聊了起来。他觉得心里也挺快活。毕竟他们都是自己喜欢的人，因此两人之间的互相喜欢也像是顺理成章的事。他不介意格里菲斯把米尔德里德的注意力都吸引走了，反正到了晚上，她是自己一个人的就行。他很像一个温柔的丈夫，对妻子万分信任，颇有兴致地看着她和别的男人无伤大雅地调情逗笑。七点半的时候，他看了看自己的表，说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They heard Griffiths coming heavily down the stairs, and Philip went into his bed-room to wash. They dined in the neighbourhood in an Italian restaurant. Philip was cross and silent, but he quickly realised that he was showing to disadvantage in comparison with Griffiths, and he forced himself to hide his annoyance. He drank a good deal of wine to destroy the pain that was gnawing at his heart, and he set himself to talk. Mildred, as though remorseful for what she had said, did all she could to make herself pleasant to him. She was kindly and affectionate. Presently Philip began to think he had been a fool to surrender to a feeling of jealousy. After dinner when they got into a hansom to drive to a music-hall Mildred, sitting between the two men, of her own accord gave him her hand. His anger vanished. Suddenly, he knew not how, he grew conscious that Griffiths was holding her other hand. The pain seized him again violently, it was a real physical pain, and he asked himself, panic-stricken, what he might have asked himself before, whether Mildred and Griffiths were in love with one another. He could not see anything of the performance on account of the mist of suspicion, anger, dismay, and wretchedness which seemed to be before his eyes; but he forced himself to conceal the fact that anything was the matter; he went on talking and laughing. Then a strange desire to torture himself seized him, and he got up, saying he wanted to go and drink something. Mildred and Griffiths had never been alone together for a moment. He wanted to leave them by themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他们听到格里菲斯重重的脚步声从楼梯传来，菲利普转身回卧室洗手去了。晚饭就选在隔壁的意大利餐厅吃。饭桌上，菲利普耷拉着脸，一声不吭。他很快就明白过来，自己在格里菲斯身边就像个不起眼的小喽啰。他极力想隐藏自己的怒火，眼下已经喝了不少酒，企图借酒消愁，强迫自己和他们谈笑风生。米尔德里德好像为她之前所说的话有点后悔，现在正使尽浑身解数想讨好他。她装得友善而温柔。菲利普开始觉得自己这样吃醋实在是傻透了。吃过晚饭后他们坐上一辆小马车去杂耍剧院，米尔德里德坐在两个男人中间，主动向菲利普伸过手去让他握住。他的怒火渐渐消了下去。可忽地一下，不知道为什么，他感觉格里菲斯正拉着她的另一只手。他又开始痛苦起来，一种真切的、生理上的痛苦，他惊慌失措地暗暗问自己（这个问题他可能早就已经问过自己了），米尔德里德和格里菲斯是不是爱上对方了？疑虑、愤怒、失望、悲伤幻化成一层迷雾笼在他眼前，台上的演出一点也看不清楚。他强作出没事儿人的样子，依旧大说大笑。一股折磨人的欲望却忽然攫住了他，他站起来说自己要去喝点东西。米尔德里德和格里菲斯还从没有单独相处过，眼下他想让他们单独待一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip did not know why he said that. He was throwing them together now to make the pain he suffered more intolerable. He did not go to the bar, but up into the balcony, from where he could watch them and not be seen. They had ceased to look at the stage and were smiling into one another's eyes. Griffiths was talking with his usual happy fluency and Mildred seemed to hang on his lips. Philip's head began to ache frightfully. He stood there motionless. He knew he would be in the way if he went back. They were enjoying themselves without him, and he was suffering, suffering. Time passed, and now he had an extraordinary shyness about rejoining them. He knew they had not thought of him at all, and he reflected bitterly that he had paid for the dinner and their seats in the music-hall. What a fool they were making of him! He was hot with shame. He could see how happy they were without him. His instinct was to leave them to themselves and go home, but he had not his hat and coat, and it would necessitate endless explanations. He went back. He felt a shadow of annoyance in Mildred's eyes when she saw him, and his heart sank.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've been enjoying myself thoroughly," said Griffiths. "I don't know about Mildred."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I met some men I knew. I've been talking to them, and I couldn't get away. I thought you'd be all right together."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You've been a devil of a time," said Griffiths, with a smile of welcome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你走了这么久啊。”格里菲斯微笑着欢迎他回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She gave a little laugh of happy complacency. There was a vulgar sound in the ring of it that horrified Philip. He suggested that they should go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她爽朗地大笑两声，笑声粗俗而刺耳。菲利普起了一身鸡皮疙瘩。他提议说该是时候回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on," said Griffiths, "we'll both drive you home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走吧，”格里菲斯说，“我们一起送你回家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's keep the cab," said Philip, when they reached the house in which Mildred was lodging. "I'm too tired to walk home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“继续坐马车吧，”到了米尔德里德住处时，菲利普说，“我太累了，不想走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip suspected that she had suggested that arrangement so that she might not be left alone with him. In the cab he did not take her hand nor did she offer it, and he knew all the time that she was holding Griffiths'. His chief thought was that it was all so horribly vulgar. As they drove along he asked himself what plans they had made to meet without his knowledge, he cursed himself for having left them alone, he had actually gone out of his way to enable them to arrange things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普怀疑这是不是她事先想好的主意，这样一来就不用和他自己单独待在一起了。坐在马车上，他没有拉米尔德里德的手，她也没有主动把手伸过来，这一路——菲利普都很清楚——她一直握着格里菲斯的手呢。真是恬不知耻。马车往前开着，他暗暗猜测着这两个人趁他不在的时候都计划了些什么。他咒骂自己怎么会傻到让他们独处，给窃窃私通提供机会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I?" Griffiths laughed. "Is that what you've been so funny about this evening? Of course not, my dear old man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我？”格里菲斯大笑起来，“你今天一晚上都怪怪的，就是因为这个？我当然没有爱上她了，亲爱的老兄啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you in love with Mildred?" he asked suddenly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你爱上米尔德里德了吗？”他忽然问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the way back Griffiths talked gaily and seemed indifferent to the fact that Philip answered in monosyllables. Philip felt he must notice that something was the matter. Philip's silence at last grew too significant to struggle against, and Griffiths, suddenly nervous, ceased talking. Philip wanted to say something, but he was so shy he could hardly bring himself to, and yet the time was passing and the opportunity would be lost. It was best to get at the truth at once. He forced himself to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="返程时，格里菲斯一路滔滔不绝地大侃特侃，尽管菲利普每次只是挤出几个字来应答，他似乎也并不在意。在菲利普看来，对方至少也该察觉到有些不对劲才是。终于，他的沉默变得让人无法抵受，格里菲斯突然感到一阵紧张，也闭紧嘴巴，不再出声。菲利普想找些话说，但又不好意思开口。时间一分一秒过去，眼看机会就要错过，事不宜迟，开门见山是最好的选择。想到这，他强迫自己开了口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He tried to slip his hand through Philip's arm, but Philip drew himself away. He knew Griffiths was lying. He could not bring himself to force Griffiths to tell him that he had not been holding the girl's hand. He suddenly felt very weak and broken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他试图用手挽过菲利普的胳膊，可菲利普却往后退了退。他知道格里菲斯在撒谎，但总不能逼着自己让他承认没有在车上拉米尔德里德的手吧。他忽然觉得自己心力交瘁，疲惫不堪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It doesn't matter to you, Harry," he said. "You've got so many women -- don't take her away from me. It means my whole life. I've been so awfully wretched."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可能对你来说，这不算什么，哈里。”他说，“你身边有那么多女人——请别把她从我身边抢走啊。她是我的命根子。我之前过得已经够惨了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His voice broke, and he could not prevent the sob that was torn from him. He was horribly ashamed of himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他泣不成声，控制不住地啜泣着。觉得自己实在太丢脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My dear old boy, you know I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. I'm far too fond of you for that. I was only playing the fool. If I'd known you were going to take it like that I'd have been more careful."</div>
