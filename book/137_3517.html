<div class="line_en">"The mud of Paris," he said to himself -- for decidedly he thought that he was sure that the gutter would prove his refuge for the night; and what can one do in a refuge, except dream?—"the mud of Paris is particularly stinking; it must contain a great deal of volatile and nitric salts. That, moreover, is the opinion of Master Nicholas Flamel, and of the alchemists --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"That devil of a hunchbacked cyclops!" he muttered between his teeth; and he tried to rise. But he was too much dazed and bruised; he was forced to remain where he was. Moreover, his hand was tolerably free; he stopped up his nose and resigned himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Whence comes this chill?" he said abruptly, to himself. He then perceived that he was lying half in the middle of the gutter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他妈的驼子独眼巨人！”他咬牙切齿地嘟囔。他想爬起来，可是头脑子昏昏沉沉，也摔得太痛了，只好仍然躺在沟里。好在手还能动，他就捂住鼻子，随它去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gringoire, thoroughly stunned by his fall, remained on the pavement in front of the Holy Virgin at the street corner. Little by little, he regained his senses; at first, for several minutes, he was floating in a sort of half-somnolent revery, which was not without its charm, in which aeriel figures of the gypsy and her goat were coupled with Quasimodo's heavy fist. This state lasted but a short time. A decidedly vivid sensation of cold in the part of his body which was in contact with the pavement, suddenly aroused him and caused his spirit to return to the surface.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰古瓦被摔得发昏，躺在拐角圣处女像前动弹不得，逐渐清醒了过来。起先还有一阵子迷迷糊糊，有点半睡半醒似的，却也不无甜蜜的感觉，只见吉卜赛姑娘和小山羊两个空幻的影子同卡席莫多沉重的拳头混成了一片。不过，时间倒也不长。他的身躯同地面接触的那一部分感到了凉气，他就猛然醒过来了，精神也振作起来了。他忽然思量：“这股子凉气是从哪里来的呢？”这时他才发现自己差不多全泡在阴沟里了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The word "alchemists" suddenly suggested to his mind the idea of Archdeacon Claude Frollo. He recalled the violent scene which he had just witnessed in part; that the gypsy was struggling with two men, that Quasimodo had a companion; and the morose and haughty face of the archdeacon passed confusedly through his memory. "That would be strange!" he said to himself. And on that fact and that basis he began to construct a fantastic edifice of hypothesis, that card-castle of philosophers; then, suddenly returning once more to reality, "Come! I'm freezing!" he ejaculated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“炼金术士”这个词儿猛然使他想起副主教克洛德·弗罗洛。他回想刚才撞见的暴行场面，吉卜赛姑娘是给两条汉子搂住挣扎的，卡席莫多有一个伙伴，副主教那阴沉沉、高傲的面容模模糊糊闪现在他脑海里（45）。——“那才奇怪哩！”他想。于是，从这个前提，从这个基础出发，他开始构造种种荒唐推想的大厦：一种哲学家的纸糊的房子。猛然，又一次回到了现实世界：“哎呀！冻得厉害！”他叫了出来。【注：（45）由炼金术士联想到副主教，是因为格兰古瓦知道他也搞这种鬼名堂，可参看以下第7部第4章。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quite a different annoyance suddenly assailed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猝然，又有另一种性质的苦恼向他袭来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The place was, in fact, becoming less and less tenable. Each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from Gringoire's loins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，这地方越来越待不得了。沟水的每一分子都夺走了格兰古瓦身侧热力的每一分子，他的体温和阴沟的水温之间开始以不可忍受的方式建立着平衡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A group of children, those little bare-footed savages who have always roamed the pavements of Paris under the eternal name of gamins, and who, when we were also children ourselves, threw stones at all of us in the afternoon, when we came out of school, because our trousers were not torn -- a swarm of these young scamps rushed towards the square where Gringoire lay, with shouts and laughter which seemed to pay but little heed to the sleep of the neighbors. They were dragging after them some sort of hideous sack; and the noise of their wooden shoes alone would have roused the dead. Gringoire who was not quite dead yet, half raised himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一群孩子——就是那种不管什么天气都在巴黎街头光着脚丫到处乱窜的小野人，名字永远叫做“流浪儿”，也就是我们小时候放学出来，看见我们的裤子没有破，就向我们扔石头的那些小家伙，——这样的一伙小淘气一窝蜂似的，也不管左邻右舍是不是要睡觉，大笑大叫，向格兰古瓦躺着的街口跑来。他们拖着一个莫名其妙的古怪口袋，光是他们木鞋的响声就连死人也吵得醒。格兰古瓦虽然还没有完全爬起来，也爬起了一半。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ohé, Hennequin Dandéche! Ohè, Jehan Pincebourde!" they shouted in deafening tones, "old Eustache Moubon, the merchant at the corner, has just died. We've got his straw pallet, we're going to have a bonfire out of it. It's the turn of the Flemish to-day!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂呀，埃纳甘·当岱希！喂呀，约翰·潘斯布德！”他们吵得震天响：“拐角上破铜烂铁商人老欧斯塔希·穆朋最近死了。我们把他的草垫子搞来了，去放个焰火玩儿。今天是欢迎弗兰德尔人的日子！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And behold, they flung the pallet directly upon Gringoire, beside whom they had arrived, without espying him. At the same time, one of them took a handful of straw and set off to light it at the wick of the good Virgin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚好走到格兰古瓦跟前，并没有瞅见他，顺手一扔，就把草垫子扔在他身上了。同时，一个小家伙抄起一把稻草，正准备从慈悲圣母座下的油捻上对个火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a critical moment. He was caught between fire and water; he made a superhuman effort, the effort of a counterfeiter of money who is on the point of being boiled, and who seeks to escape. He rose to his feet, flung aside the straw pallet upon the street urchins, and fled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事急矣！他就要陷入水火夹攻之中了。他作出超人的挣扎——那种就要下油锅、没命挣扎的制造假钱者的惊人努力。一蹦而起，一把抓起草垫子向顽童们扔去，赶紧跑掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The straw mattress remained master of the field. Belleforet, Father Le Juge, and Corrozet affirm that it was picked up on the morrow, with great pomp, by the clergy of the quarter, and borne to the treasury of the church of Saint Opportune, where the sacristan, even as late as 1789, earned a tolerably handsome revenue out of the great miracle of the Statue of the Virgin at the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, which had, by its mere presence, on the memorable night between the sixth and seventh of January, 1482, exorcised the defunct Eustache Moubon, who, in order to play a trick on the devil, had at his death maliciously concealed his soul in his straw pallet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="草垫子独霸了战场。推事老爹倍勒福瑞，还有科罗泽，一致肯定：次日，该地段的教士们以隆重的仪式把这块草垫子捡回来，送进了圣运教堂宝库，从此直至一七八九年（46），管圣器的人都赚了很多钱：说是莫贡塞伊街拐角的圣母像在那个可纪念的一四八二年一月六日夜里，大显神灵，咒逐了已故欧斯塔希·穆朋，该人向魔鬼恶作剧，死的时候故意捣蛋，把自己的阴魂隐藏在草垫子里。【注：（46）法国资产阶级大革命时期，数度有查封教堂、没收教会财产之举。】">查看中文翻译</div>
