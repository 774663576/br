<div class="line_en">"Okay, here's your furnace," Watson said, turning on a light in the dark, musty-smelling room. He was a beefy man with fluffy popcorn hair, white shirt, and dark green chinos. He swung open a small square grating in the furnace's belly and he and Jack peered in together. "This here's the pilot light." A steady blue -- white jet hissing steadily upward channeled destructive force, but the key word, Jack thought, was destructive and not channeled: if you stuck your hand in there, the barbecue would happen in three quick seconds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，这是火炉。”沃森一边说，一边打开了电灯。沃森身板结实，有一头蓬乱的玉米花色头发，上身穿着白衬衣，下身穿一条深绿色斜纹布裤子。他打开火炉下面的一扇方形小门，和杰克一道往里瞧。“这是信号灯。”蓝色的火苗不住地嘶嘶往上直窜，输送着一股毁灭性的力量，杰克想，关键词是“毁灭”而不是“输送”：把手伸到那儿，不出3秒钟烤肉就做成了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The pilot's got a fail-safe," Watson told him. "Little sensor in there measures heat. If the heat falls below a certain point, it sets off a buzzer in your quarters. Boiler's on the other side of the wall. I'll take you around." He slammed the grating shut and led Jack behind the iron bulk of the furnace toward another door. The iron radiated a stuporous heat at them, and for some reason Jack thought of a large, dozing cat. Watson jingled his keys and whistled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“信号灯有自动防故障装置，”沃森告诉他。“这儿有个测温度的小玩意儿。温度降到某点时它就会在你的房间里发出嗡嗡声。锅炉在墙那边。我带你去看看。”他“啪”地一声关上了小门，领着杰克向铁疙瘩火炉背后的那道门走去。铁疙瘩散发的热量烘得他们昏昏沉沉的，不知出于什么缘故，杰克想起了一只打瞌睡的大猫。沃森一边叮铃叮铃地摆弄着钥匙，一边打着口哨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">(When he went back into his study and saw Danny standing there, wearing nothing but his training pants and a grin, a slow, red cloud of rage had eclipsed Jack's reason. It had seemed slow subjectively, inside his head, but it must have all happened in less than a minute. It only seemed slow the way some dreams seem slow. The bad ones. Every door and drawer in his study seemed to have been ransacked in the time he had been gone. Closet, cupboards, the sliding bookcase. Every desk drawer yanked out to the stop. His manuscript, the three-act play he had been slowly developing from a novelette he had written seven years ago as an under-graduate, was scattered all over the floor. He had been drinking a beer and doing the Act II corrections when Wendy said the phone was for him, and Danny had poured the can of beer all over the pages. Probably to see it foam. See it foam, see it foam, the words played over and over in his mind like a single sick chord on an out-of-tune piano, completing the circuit of his rage. He stepped deliberately toward his three year-old son, who was looking up at him with that pleased grin, his pleasure at the job of work so successfully and recently completed in Daddy's study; Danny began to say something and that was when he had grabbed Danny's hand and bent it to make him drop the typewriter eraser and the mechanical pencil he was clenching in it. Danny had cried out a little… no… no… tell the truth… he screamed. It was all hard to remember through the fog of anger, the sick single thump of that one Spike Jones chord. Wendy somewhere, asking what was wrong. Her voice faint, damped by the inner mist. This was between the two of them. He had whirled Danny around to spank him, his big adult fingers digging into the scant meat of the boy's forearm, meeting around it in a closed fist, and the snap of the breaking bone had not been loud, not loud but it had been very loud, HUGE, but not loud. Just enough of a sound to slit through the red fog like an arrow -- but instead of letting in sunlight, that sound let in the dark clouds of shame and remorse, the terror, the agonizing convulsion of the spirit. A clean sound with the past on one side of it and all the future on the other, a sound like a breaking pencil lead or a small piece of kindling when you brought it down over your knee. A moment of utter silence on the other side, in respect to the beginning future maybe, all the rest of his life. Seeing Danny's face drain of color until it was like cheese, seeing his eyes, always large, grow larger still, and glassy, Jack sure the boy was going to faint dead away into the puddle of beer and papers; his own voice, weak and drunk, slurry, trying to take it all back, to find a way around that not too loud sound of bone cracking and into the past -- is there a status quo in the house? -- saying: Danny, are you all right? Danny's answering shriek, then Wendy's shocked gasp as she came around them and saw the peculiar angle Danny's forearm had to his elbow; no arm was meant to hang quite that way in a world of normal families. Her own scream as she swept him into her arms, and a nonsense babble: Oh God Danny oh dear God oh sweet God your poor sweet arm; and Jack was standing there, stunned and stupid, trying to understand how a thing like this could have happened. He was standing there and his eyes met the eyes of his wife and he saw that Wendy hated him. It did not occur to him what the hate might mean in practical terms; it was only later that he realized she might have left him that night, gone to a motel, gotten a divorce lawyer in the morning; or called the police. He saw only that his wife hated him and he felt staggered by it, all alone. He felt awful. This was what oncoming death felt like. Then she fled for the telephone and dialed the hospital with their screaming boy wedged in the crook of her arm and Jack did not go after her, he only stood in the ruins of his office, smelling beer and thinking --) You lost your temper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（杰克回到书房，看见丹尼站在那里，身上除了运动短裤外什么都没穿，还咧着嘴在笑，一阵怒火吞噬了杰克的理智。在他的意识中，一切都显得十分缓慢，但那件事肯定发生在不到一分钟之内。梦魇一般地缓慢。糟糕！他出去那会儿，书房里的每扇门、每个抽屉好像都被彻底搜查过一遍似的。壁橱、立柜、活动书架，都是乱糟糟的。写字桌的抽屉都拉出来了。他的稿子——好不容易从他大学时代写的一个中篇小说改写成的3幕话剧——乱七八糟地散落在地板上。他正喝着啤酒修改第二幕，这时，温迪叫他去接电话，丹尼就把那罐啤酒全洒在了稿纸上。也许他想看啤酒冒泡泡。看它冒泡泡，看它冒泡泡，这句话就像一架破钢琴发出的单调乏味的声音，一遍遍在他脑子里回响，这使他愈加怒不可遏。他一步一步向3岁的儿子走过去，小家伙这时还乐呵呵地看着他，对自己刚刚在爸爸的书房里完成的杰作颇为得意；丹尼张嘴正要说什么，杰克一把抓住他的手，扭了一下，想让他丢开手里攥着的打字机刷子和活动铅笔。丹尼大声叫起来…不…不…老实说，他在尖叫。盛怒之中，杰克几乎没听见丹尼的尖叫声。温迪在什么地方问：怎么啦。她的声音笼罩在他内心的迷雾中，显得十分微弱。这是他们爷儿俩之间的事。他紧紧抓住丹尼的前臂，粗大的手指掐入小孩的细皮嫩肉里，他把丹尼翻过来正要打，这时，喀嚓！骨头断裂的声音！这声音不大，但非常锐利，足以像利箭一般穿透红色的迷雾——但它没有使雾散日出，而是把他送进了羞愧、痛悔、恐惧和苦涩的精神痉挛的乌云之中。这声音把过去和未来断然割裂，听起来好像跟折断一截铅笔头或一小根引火柴的声音没什么两样，但它的另一边却是一片死寂，也许这就是他未来的开始，他的全部余生。看到丹尼脸上的血色渐渐退去，直到像一块刷白的奶酪，看到他那双大眼睛还在变大，像玻璃球一样毫无生气，杰克以为，丹尼一定会晕倒在这一片狼藉中。杰克自己的声音——微弱，含混不清，绝望地企图挽回一切，企图找到一条能避开那个喀嚓声而回到从前 [这屋子里存在“当前”吗？]的路——在问：丹尼，你没事吧？丹尼的回答是一声尖叫，这时，温迪走过来，看到丹尼前臂与肘关节的那个角度，震惊得喘不过气来；任何一个正常家庭中都不会有胳膊那样耷拉着。她一把揽过儿子，尖叫一声，然后开始胡乱嘟囔：噢天哪丹尼噢亲爱的上帝噢宝贝儿上帝你那可怜的宝贝胳膊；杰克傻站在那儿，目瞪口呆，企图弄明白怎么会发生这样的事。他站在那里，碰上了温迪的目光，他看出了其中的敌意。当时他没有考虑这种敌意的实际含义，只是到了后来，他才意识到那天晚上她有可能离他而去，搬到旅馆，并在第二天上午找一位办离婚案的律师，或者叫来警察。他妻子恨他，他对此感到手足无措，孤立无援。他感到十分害怕，好像大难即将临头一般。这时，她冲向电话，拨了医院的号码，儿子蜷在她的臂弯里，尖声哭喊着。杰克没有跟她去，他站在凌乱不堪的书房中，闻着啤酒味，默想着——）你发了脾气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“喏，锅炉，”沃森宣布道。他从后裤兜掏出一条红蓝相间的扎染印花大手巾，呼地一声擤了一下鼻子，匆匆瞟了一眼，看看是否留下了什么有趣的东西，然后塞回口袋不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rubbed his hand harshly across his lips and followed Watson into the boiler room. It was humid in here, but it was more than the humidity that brought the sick and slimy sweat onto his brow and stomach and legs. The remembering did that, it was a total thing that made that night two years ago seem like two hours ago. There was no lag. It brought the shame and revulsion back, the sense of having no worth at all, and that feeling always made him want to have a drink, and the wanting of a drink brought still blacker despair -- would he ever have an hour, not a week or even a day, mind you, but just one waking hour when the craving for a drink wouldn't surprise him like this?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克使劲地抹了一把嘴唇，跟着沃森进了锅炉房。屋里很潮湿，但这并不是给他周身带来一层臭汗的唯一原因——还有刚才的回忆，它抹平了时间间隔，把两年前的那个晚上拉到杰克眼前，使他又一次感到羞愧、自憎，使他觉得自己毫无价值，而且，每当有这样的感觉，他就会动喝酒的念头，使自己陷入更深的绝望之中。他能享有这样一个小时吗——请注意，不是一周，甚至不是一天——在这样一个清醒的小时里，他不必为想喝杯酒而感到如此地惊慌？">查看中文翻译</div>

That Ullman, he manages some honky-tonky resort place down in Florida in the off-season, and he caught a plane up to Denver and hired a sleigh to take him up here from Sidewinder because the roads were closed -- a sleigh, can you believe that? He about split a gut tryin to keep it out of the papers. Did pretty well, I got to give him that. There was an item in the Denver Post, and of course the bituary in that pissant little rag they have down in Estes Park, but that was just about all.

No thirteenth floor or room thirteen, no mirrors on the back of the door you come in through, stuff like that. Why, we lost a lady just this last July. Ullman had to take care of that, and you can bet your ass he did. That's what they pay him twenty-two thousand bucks a season for, and as much as I dislike the little prick, he earns it. It's like some people just come here to throw up and they hire a guy like Ullman to clean up the messes. Here's this woman, must be sixty fuckin years old -- my age! -- and her hair's dyed just as red as a whore's stoplight, tits saggin just about down to her belly button on account of she ain't wearin no brassy-ear, big varycoarse veins all up and down her legs so they look like a couple of goddam roadmaps, the jools drippin off her neck and arms an hangin out her ears.

And she'd be makin jokes and sayin all these witty things, and every time she said one he'd grin just like a fuckin ape, like she had strings tied to the corners of his mouth. Only after a few days you could see it was gettin harder an harder for him to grin, and God knows what he had to think about to get his pump primed by bedtime. Well, they'd go in for dinner, him walkin and her staggerin, drunk as a coot, you know, and he'd be pinchin the waitresses and grinnin at em when she wasn't lookin.
