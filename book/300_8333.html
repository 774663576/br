<div class="line_en">HESTER PRYNNE'S term of confinement was now at an end. Her prison-door was thrown open, and she came forth into the sunshine, which, falling on all alike, seemed, to her sick and morbid heart, as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast. Perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison, than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described, where she was made the common infamy, at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger. Then, she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the combative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph. It was, moreover, a separate and insulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime, and to meet which, therefore, reckless of economy, she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years. The very law that condemned her -- a giant of stern features, but with vigour to support, as well as to annihilate, in his iron arm -- had held her up, through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy. But now, with this unattended walk from her prison-door, began the daily custom; and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature, or sink beneath it. She could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief. Tomorrow would bring its own trial with it; so would the next day, and so would the next; each its own trial, and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne. The days of the far-off future would toil onward, still with the same burden for her to take up, and bear along with her, but never to fling down; for the accumulating days, and added years, would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame. Throughout them all, giving up her individuality, she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point, and in which they might vivify and embody their images of woman's frailty and sinful passion. Thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her, with the scarlet letter flaming on her breast -- at her, the child of honourable parents -- at her, the mother of a babe, that would hereafter be a woman -- at her, who had once been innocent -- as the figure, the body, the reality of sin. And over her grave, the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument.</div>

<div class="line_en">It may seem marvellous, that, with the world before her -- kept by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the Puritan settlement, so remote and so obscure -- free to return to her birthplace, or to any other European land, and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior, as completely as if emerging into another state of being -- and having also the passes of the dark, inscrutable forest open to her, where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned her -- it may seem marvellous, that this woman should still call that place her home, where, and where only, she must needs be the type of shame. But there is a fatality, a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom, which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt, ghost-like, the spot where some great and marked event has given the colour to their lifetime; and still the more irresistibly, the darker the tinge that saddens it. Her sin, her ignominy, were the roots which she had struck into the soil. It was as if a new birth, with stronger assimilations than the first, had converted the forest-land, still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer, into Hester Prynne's wild and dreary, but life-long home. All other scenes of earth -- even that village of rural England, where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother's keeping, like garments put off long ago -- were foreign to her, in comparison. The chain that bound her here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost soul, but could never be broken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事说来令人不可思议：既然她的判决词中没有限制她不得超越清教徒居民区的条款，那么在这片边远偏僻的土地之外，她面对着整个世界，原可以自由地回到她的出生地或任何其它欧洲国家，改头换面，隐姓埋名，一切从新开始；她还面对着通向阴森莫测的莽林的道路，也可以在那里逃脱制裁她的法律，使自己不驯顺的本性在生活习俗完全两样的民族中相得益彰。看来实在不可思议的是，她竟然仍把这地方视作自己的家园；而恰恰在这里，况且也只有在这里，她才会成为耻辱的典型。但确实有一种天数，一种具有冥冥之力的如此不可抗拒和难以避免的感情，迫使人们象幽灵般出汲并滞留在发生过为他终生增色添辉、引人瞩目的重大事件的地方，而且那事件的悲伤色调愈浓，人们也就愈难以背离那块地方。她的罪孽，她的耻辱，便是她深扎于此地的根。她在这块土地上好象获得了比她降生人世更具融熔力量的新生，海丝特·白兰的这一新生把所有其他移民和飘泊者仍感到格格不入的森林地带，变成了她自己荒凉阴郁但却是终生安身立命之家。世界上别的景色，甚至包括她度过幸福的童年和无暇的少女时期的英格兰乡村——象是早巳换下的衣服，交给她母亲去保管了——，相比之下，那些地方在她眼里那是它乡异地了。将她束缚在这里的，是源源傲进她心灵深处的铁打的锁链，永远不可能断裂了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hester Prynne, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of the town, within the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinity to any other habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. It had been built by an earlier settler, and abandoned, because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation, while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants. It stood on the shore, looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-covered hills, towards the west. A clump of scrubby trees, such as alone grew on the peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed. In this little, lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she possessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her, Hester established herself, with her infant child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot. Children, too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities, would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottage-window, or standing in the doorway, or labouring in her little garden, or coming forth along the pathway that led townward; and, discerning the scarlet letter on her breast, would scamper off with a strange, contagious fear.</div>

<div class="line_en">By degrees, nor very slowly, her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion. Whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny; or from the morbid curiosity that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless things; or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then, as now, sufficient to bestow, on some persons, what others might seek in vain; or because Hester really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant; it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle. Vanity, it may be, chose to mortify itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and state, the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands. Her needle-work was seen on the ruff of the Governor; military men wore it on their scarfs, and the minister on his hand; it decked the baby's little cap; it was shut up, to be mildewed and moulder away, in the coffins of the dead. But it is not recorded that, in a single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride. The exception indicated the ever relentless vigour with which society frowned upon her sin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant, Hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on wretches less miserable than herself, and who not infrequently insulted the hand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in making coarse garments for the poor. It is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation, and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment, in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork. She had in her nature a rich, voluptuous, Oriental characteristic -- a taste for the gorgeously beautiful, which, save in the exquisite productions of her needle, found nothing else, in all the possibilities of her life, to exercise itself upon. Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible to the other sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. To Hester Prynne it might have been a mode of expressing, and therefore soothing, the passion of her life. Like all other joys, she rejected it as sin. This morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened, it is to be feared, no genuine and steadfast penitence, but something doubtful, something that might be deeply wrong, beneath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特除去在打扮孩子上稍有花费外，她把全部积蓄都用在了救济他人上面，尽管那些入并不比她更为不幸，而且还时常忘思负义地对她横加侮辱。她时常替穷人制作粗布衣服，而如果她把这些时间用来发挥她的手艺，收入原可以更多的。她做这种活计可能有忏悔的念头，不过，她花这么多时间干粗活，确实牺牲了乐趣。她天生就有一种追求富足和奢华的东方人的秉性——一种喜欢穷奢极欲的情调，但这一点在她的全部生活中，除去在她那精美的针线手士中尚可施展之外，已经别无表现的可能了。女人从一针一线的操劳中所能获得的乐趣，是男人无法理解的。对海丝特·白兰来说，可能只有靠这样一种抒发形式，才能慰藉自己对生活的激情。但即使对这绝无仅有的一点乐趣，她也不例外地象看待其它乐趣一样地视为罪过。把良心和一件无关紧要的事情病态地联系在一起，恐怕并不能说明真心实意的仟悔，其背后可能有些颇值怀疑和极其荒谬的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence, of the plainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and a simple abundance for her child. Her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue; with only that one ornament -- the scarlet letter -- which it was her doom to wear. The child's attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by a fanciful, or, we might rather say, a fantastic ingenuity, which served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning. We may speak further of it hereafter.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this manner, Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the world. With her native energy of character, and rare capacity, it could not entirely cast her off, although it had set a mark upon her, more intolerable to a woman's heart than that which branded the brow of Cain. In all her intercourse with society, however, there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it. Every gesture, every word, and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact, implied, and often expressed, that she was banished, and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere, or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind. She stood apart from moral interests, yet close beside them, like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer make itself seen or felt; no more smile with the household joy, nor mourn with the kindred sorrow; or, should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy, awakening only terror and horrible repugnance. These emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scorn besides, seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart. It was not an age of delicacy; and her position, although she understood it well, and was in little danger of forgetting it, was often brought before her vivid self-perception, like a new anguish, by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot. The poor, as we have already said, whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succour them. Dames of elevated rank, likewise, whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation, were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart; sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice, by which women can concoct a subtile poison from ordinary trifles; and sometimes, also, by a coarser expression, that fell upon the sufferer's defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound. Hester had schooled herself long and well; she never responded to these attacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom. She was patient -- a martyr, indeed -- but she forbore to pray for her enemies; lest, in spite of her forgiving aspirations, the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，海丝特·白兰在人世上有了自己的一席之地。由于她生性倔强而且才能出众，虽说人们让她佩戴了一个对女性的心灵来说比烙在该隐额上的印记还要难堪的标志，部无法彻底摒弃她。然而，她在同社会的一切交往中，却只能有格格不入之感。同她有所接触的那些人的一举一动、一言一行、甚至他们的沉默不语，都在暗示，往往还表明：她是被排除在外的；而她的孤凄的处境似乎证明：她是生活在另一个世界中的，只有靠与众不同的感官来同其余的人类交流。对于人们感兴趣的道德问题，她避之犹恐不及，却又不能不关心，恰似一个幽灵重返故宅，但又无法让家入看见或感到，不能和家中的亲人们共笑同悲；即使得以表现出为人禁止的同情，也只能唤起别人的恐惧与厌恶。事实上，她的这种心情以及随之而来的最辛辣的嘲讽，似乎成了她在世人心目中所保留曲唯一份额了。在那感情还不够细腻的时代，虽然她深知自己的处境，时刻不敢忘怀，但由于人们不时最粗暴地触痛她最嫩弱的地方，使她清晰地自我感觉到一次次新的剧痛。如前所述，她一心一意接济穷苦人，但她伸出的救援之手所得到的回根却是谩骂。同样，她由于职业关系而迈入富室时，上流社会的夫人们却惯于向她心中滴入苦汁；有时她们不动声色地对她施展阴谋，因为女人们最善于利用日常琐事调制微妙的毒剂；有时她们则明目张长胆地攻汗她那毫无防御的心灵，犹如在渍烂的创口上再重重地一击。海丝特长期以来对此泰然处之；她毫无反手之力，只是在苍白的面颊上不禁泛起红潮，然后便潜入内心深处。她事事忍让，确实是一位殉道者，但她不准自己为敌人祈祷——她尽管宽宏大量，却唯恐自己用来祝福的语言会顽强地扭曲成对他们的诅咒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations, had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend. They averred, that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight, whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time. And we must needs say, it seared Hester's bosom so deeply, that perhaps there was more truth in the rumour than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit.</div>
