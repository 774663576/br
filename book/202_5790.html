<div class="line_en">It was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight. Harry's dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked ring, then through a wreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午夜赫敏来换班时，外面下起了雪。哈利的梦境混乱不安；纳吉尼游进游出，先是钻过一个巨大的、有裂缝的戒指，然后又钻过一个圣诞玫瑰花环。他一次次惊恐地醒来，相信刚才有人在远处叫他的名字，把风吹打帐篷的声音想象成脚步声和说话声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We'll go somewhere more sheltered," she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. "I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or twice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是得换个更隐蔽的地方。”她赞同道，一边哆嗦着在睡衣上加了一件运动衫，“我总觉得听到有人在外面走动，有一两次还好像看到了人影。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，他在黑暗中爬起来，走到赫敏身边。她正蜷缩在帐篷口，借着魔杖的光亮看《魔法史》。大雪还在纷纷扬扬地下着，听到他提议早点收拾东西转移，她欣然同意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where are we?" he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们在哪儿？”他问，一边打量这片陌生的林子。赫敏已经打开串珠小包，开始把帐篷杆抽出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry's feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半小时后，帐篷收拾好了，哈利带着魂器，赫敏抓着串珠小包，一同幻影移形。熟悉的窒息感吞没了他们，哈利的双脚离开了雪地，然后重重地落在地面上，好像是一片覆满落叶的冻土。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression reinforced by Hermione's solicitousness. That afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这儿冷得够呛，树林也是银装素裹，但至少能挡风。他们大部分时间都躲在帐篷里，蜷在赫敏擅长营造的那些明亮的蓝色火苗旁边取暖。这些火苗非常有用，可以舀起来放在瓶子里随身携带。哈利觉得自己像是经历了一场短暂但严重的疾病后在休养康复，赫敏的关怀强化了这种感觉。下午天空中又飘起雪花，连他们所在的这片有遮挡的空地也撒上了一层晶粉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After two nights of little sleep, Harry's senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric's Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione's offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利两夜没怎么睡觉，感官似乎更加警觉了。戈德里克山谷的死里逃生是那么惊险，伏地魔似乎比以前更近，威胁更大了。夜幕再次降临，哈利拒绝让赫敏放哨，叫她去睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大森林中，每个细微的动静似乎都被放大了。哈利知道林子里一定有许多动物，但他希望它们都保持安静，免得他把它们无害的奔跑和蹑行声与其他预示危险的声音混在一起。他想起多年前斗篷在枯叶上滑动的声音，马上觉得又听到了似的，赶紧抖搂精神。防护魔法这么多星期来一直有效，现在怎么会不灵呢？然而他甩不掉一种感觉：今晚似乎有些异常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder's Map, so as to watch Ginny's dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利搬了个旧垫子坐到帐篷口，穿着他所有的毛衣，还是冷得直打哆嗦。黑暗越来越浓，浓得几乎无法穿透。他正要取出活点地图看一会儿金妮的黑点，这才想起今天是圣诞节，她应该在陋居。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利几次猛然坐起，脖子僵硬发痛，因为他不知不觉歪靠在帐篷壁上睡着了。夜色更加深沉，那是一种天鹅绒般的浓黑，他仿佛悬在幻影移形和幻影显形之间的境界。他正要把一只手举到面前，试试能否看到五指时，奇事发生了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一点明亮的银光出现在他的正前方，在树林间穿行。不知道光源是什么，但它的移动无声无息，那银光简直就像在向他飘来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione's wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他跳了起来，举起赫敏的魔杖，声音在嗓子里冻结了。他眯起眼睛，因为那银光已非常耀眼，前面的树丛都成了漆黑的剪影，而那东西还在靠近……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver-white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后那光源从一棵橡树后面飘了出来，是一头银白色的牝鹿，月光般皎洁明亮，优雅地轻踏地面，依然无声无息，细软的白雪上没有留下丝毫蹄印。它朝他走来，高昂着美丽的头，大眼睛，长睫毛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”他说，嗓子因为长时间不用而沙哑了，“回来！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利盯着这个灵物，心中充满惊讶，不是因为它的奇异，而是因为它那无法解释的熟悉和亲切。他觉得自己一直在等它，只是一度忘记了，现在才想起他们的约会。他想喊赫敏的冲动刚才还如此强烈，可现在一下子消失了。他知道，并可以用生命打赌，它是来找他的，是专门来找他的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们对视了良久，然后它转身离去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牝鹿继续从容不迫地在树林中穿行，很快，明亮的身体便印上了粗黑的树干的条纹。在紧张颤栗的一秒钟里，哈利犹豫着，警钟轻轻敲响：它可能是一个诡计，一个诱饵。但是本能，不可抗拒的本能，告诉他这不是黑魔法。他追了上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪在哈利脚下嘎吱作响，但牝鹿无声无息地在林中穿行，因为它只是光。它领着他往森林里越走越深。哈利走得很快，相信等牝鹿停下时，会让他好好走近它的，然后它还会说话，那声音将说出他需要知道的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence had meant safety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管黑暗已将它整个吞没，但它那明亮的形象仍印在他的视网膜上，模糊了他的视线。他垂下眼帘时，那形象变得更加明亮，让他辨不清方向。现在，恐惧袭上了他的心头：本来它的存在意味着安全。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牝鹿的形象随着哈利的每一次眨眼而渐渐消失。他站在那儿，听着森林里的各种声音，远处树枝折断的声音，夜雪轻柔的沙沙声。他会受到袭击吗？它会不会把他引进一个埋伏圈？好像有人站在魔杖照不到的地方看着他，是他的想象吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他小心地走上前俯视，冰面映出他变形的影子和魔杖的光线。但那厚厚的、朦胧的灰色冰盖下还有一个东西在闪亮，一个银色的大十字……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他几乎停止了呼吸，低头盯着它。这怎么可能呢？它怎么会躺在森林中的池塘里，离他们宿营的地方这么近？是什么未知的魔法把赫敏吸引到这里的吗？或者牝鹿是守卫这个池塘的（他觉得它像守护神）？或者宝剑是在他们来了之后才特意被放进池塘的？要是这样，想把宝剑交给哈利的人又是谁呢？他再次用魔杖指着周围的树丛，搜索着一个人影或一只闪烁的眼睛，但没有发现任何人。不过，一丝新添的恐惧搀杂到兴奋中，他把注意力转到了静静躺在冰下的池底的那把宝剑上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool's edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red… It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt… The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的心跳到了喉咙口：他在池塘边跑了下来，将魔杖倾斜，让光线尽可能照到池底。深红色的光芒一闪……是一把剑，柄上的红宝石闪闪发光……格兰芬多的宝剑躺在森林中的池底。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宝剑一动不动，他并没指望它飞来。要是那么容易的话，宝剑就会躺在地上等他来捡，而不会在结冰的池塘深处了。他开始绕着圆形冰面走动，努力回忆着上次宝剑自动落到他手中的情形，当时他处境危急，正在求救。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow.

<div class="line_en">Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by, another person was panting and coughing and staggering around. Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake attacked… Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps…</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior's identity. All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone: Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death's…</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron's reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water's edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry's life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利无法回答。与罗恩重新出现相比，银色的牝鹿已无关紧要，真的无关紧要。他真不敢相信。他冷得瑟瑟发抖，抓起仍然搁在水边的那堆衣服，一边一件接一件地套到头上，一边盯着罗恩，有些担心每次一看不见他就会消失。但他应该是真的：他刚才跳进池塘救了自己的命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron's hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione's wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魂器仍在罗恩手中晃荡，挂坠盒微微颤动。哈利知道里面的东西又焦躁不安了，它刚才感到宝剑就在近旁，便试图勒死哈利，不让他拿到宝剑。现在不是长谈的时候，应该马上彻底摧毁挂坠盒。哈利高举着赫敏的魔杖环顾四周，找到了地方：在一棵悬铃木的树荫下，有一块平坦的大石头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I took it out," Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, "and it didn't seem different or anything, but I was sure I'd heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“于是我把它拿了出来，”罗恩看着熄灯器继续说，“它看上去没有什么异样，但我很确定我听到了你的声音，所以就摁了一下，我屋里的灯熄了，但另一个灯出现在窗外。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It sort of floated toward me," said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, "right to my chest, and then -- it just went straight through. It was here," he touched a point close to his heart, "I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go.

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, well, that would've been me," said Ron. "Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn't see you and I couldn't hear you.

But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn't see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end -- and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously."</div>
