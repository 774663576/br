<div class="line_en">It was only when Rose Marie had her worst fits that she accused her father, Don Clericuzio, of the death of her husband. The Don always denied giving the order, as he denied that his sons and Pippi had carried out the massacre. But after she accused him two times, he packed her off to the clinic for a month. After that, she only ranted and raved, and never accused him directly again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dante Clericuzio did not have to hear this story. His mother, Rose Marie, had whispered it into his tiny ear from the time he was two years old: whenever she had one of her fits, whenever she felt her grief for the lost love of her husband and her brother Silvio, whenever her terror of Pippi and her brothers overcame her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹特·克莱里库齐奥没必要再听一遍这段往事。他的母亲，萝塞·玛丽耶在他两岁的时候就原原本本给他讲过了：每次她发病时，或是因失去丈夫和弟弟西尔维奥而痛苦不已时，又或是沉浸在对皮皮和三个哥哥的恐惧中时，她都会对他诉说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Dante remembered her whisperings always. As a child he loved his grandfather and believed in his innocence.

<div class="line_en">But in her fits she was foul-mouthed, full of curses, even her face could turn into an ugly mask of fury. Dante was always bewildered. When he was seven years old, a doubt entered his mind. "How did you know it was Pippi and my uncles?" he asked her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但发病的时候，她骂骂咧咧，满口诅咒，甚至她的脸都因为愤怒而扭曲成丑陋的样子。丹特一直很困惑，他七岁时生起一道疑问。“你怎么知道那是皮皮和我的舅舅们呢？”他问她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Rose Marie was normal she took care of the widower Don Clericuzio with the utmost affection. To her three brothers she showed sisterly concern. With Pippi, she was distant. And because in those times she had such a sweet visage, it was difficult for her to express malice convincingly. The structure of the bones in her face, the curve of her mouth, and the gentle eyes of liquid brown denied her hate. To her child Dante she showed her overwhelming need to love, which she could no longer feel for any man. She showered him with gifts out of that affection, as did his grandfather and his uncles out of something less pure, a love muddied with guilt. When Rose Marie was normal, she never told Dante the story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萝塞·玛丽耶正常的时候，她把丧偶的唐·克莱里库齐奥照料得无微不至，对三个哥哥表现出妹妹的关心，对皮皮，她敬而远之。神志清醒的时候，她面容那么甜美，看不见一星半点的恶意。她的脸型、嘴角的弧度和清澄的褐色双眼里找不到半分憎恶。对儿子丹特，她爱之至深，天底下再没有哪个男人能让她动情至此。出于母爱，她送给丹特好多礼物，虽然丹特的祖父和三个舅舅也送了不少东西，但动机却不那么纯洁，而是一种混杂着内疚的爱意。当萝塞·玛丽耶清醒的时候，她从没对丹特提起过那段往事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rose Marie cackled with glee. She seemed to Dante a witch out of his fairy-tale books. She told him, "They think they are so clever, that they plan for everything with their masks and special clothes and hats. Do you want to know what they forgot? Pippi was still wearing his dancing shoes. Patent leather and black string bows. And your uncles always grouped themselves together in a particular way. Giorgio always to the front, Vincent a little behind, and Petie always to the right. And the way they looked at Pippi to see if he would give the order to kill me. Because I had recognized them. The way they wavered, almost shrank back. But they would have killed me, they would have. My own brothers." She would then burst into such great weeping that Dante would be terrified.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萝塞·玛丽耶一听，咯咯笑个不停。丹特看来，母亲活脱脱就是从自己那些童话书里面走出来的巫婆。她对他说：“他们觉得自己有多聪明，他们觉得有了那些蒙面，有了那些特殊的衣服和帽子，我就看不出来了。你想不想知道他们忘了什么？皮皮还穿着他的舞鞋，带着蝴蝶结的漆皮鞋。还有，你的舅舅们站队的顺序永远是特定的。乔治一直站在前面，文森特稍微后边，佩蒂耶在右边。我认出他们的时候，他们转过头看着皮皮，看他会不会下令杀我。他们犹豫不决，都想走开。但是他们当时真应该杀了我的，我的亲哥哥。”之后她放声大哭，伤心欲绝的神色把丹特吓坏了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Dante was ten years old, he had learned to watch for his mother's fits, and so when she beckoned him to her to tell the Santadio story again, he would quickly take her away into the safety of her bedroom so his grandfather and his uncles would not hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹特十岁那年，他已经学会要留心母亲发病，她一叫他过去，又要讲桑塔迪奥家的故事时，他就急忙把她带到她的卧室里，这里安全，不会让祖父和舅舅们听见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time Dante grew into manhood, he was too clever to be fooled by all the disguises of the Clericuzio Family. He was of so humorously malicious a nature that he showed his grandfather and his uncles that he knew the truth. And he could perceive that his uncles were not that fond of him. Dante had been designated to join the legal social world, to perhaps take Giorgio's place and learn the financial complexities, but he showed no interest. He had even taunted his uncles that he had no interest in the sissy side of the Family. Giorgio listened to this with a coolness that for a moment frightened the sixteen-year-old Dante.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹特成年之后，他的聪明才智已经足够识破克莱里库齐奥家族的所有伪装。他天性顽劣，有意让他的祖父和舅舅们明白，他是知道真相的。他也能感觉得到，他的舅舅并没那么喜欢他。丹特本是要被遣去合法世界的，也许会接乔治的班，学习复杂的经济知识，但他对此显得丝毫不感兴趣。他甚至奚落舅舅，说他对家族这些娘娘腔的东西没有兴趣。乔治不动声色地听完，这反应让十六岁的丹特吓了一跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even as a small child of seven, he would try to comfort her. "Uncle Petie would never hurt you," he said. "And Grandpa would have killed them all if they did." He wasn't certain of his Uncle Giorgio or even Uncle Vinnie. But in his child's heart, it was Pippi he could never forgive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使只是个七岁的小孩子，他也试着安慰她。“佩蒂耶舅舅绝不会伤害你的。”他说，“要是他们伤害你的话，祖父会要他们的命。”他不确定自己对乔治舅舅甚或是文尼舅舅的感情，但是在他幼小的心灵中，他绝不会原谅皮皮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Dante quit high school in his senior year, he was sent to work in Petie's construction company in the Bronx Enclave. Dante was a hard worker and developed huge muscles from the hard, grueling work on the building sites. Petie put him on crews of soldiers from the Bronx Enclave. When Dante was old enough, the Don decreed the boy would be a soldier under Petie.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Don had come to his decision only after reports from Giorgio on Dante's character, and some acts committed by Dante. The young boy was accused of rape by a pretty high school classmate and of assault with a small knife by another fellow student, a boy his own age. Dante had begged his uncles not to let his grandfather know and they had promised him, but of course they had reported to the Don immediately. These charges were settled by large sums of money before Dante could be prosecuted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治把丹特的所作所为向唐汇报之后，唐才作下这个决定。丹特班里一个漂亮的女孩控诉他强奸，另一个同龄同学控诉他用小刀行凶。丹特乞求舅舅别让祖父知道这两件事，他们答应了，但是不出意料，他们转头就告诉了唐。家族花了很多钱，才把这些指控抹平。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And it was during his teenage years that his jealousy of Cross De Lena increased. Cross had grown into a tall, extraordinarily handsome youth with a mature courtesy. All the women in the Clericuzio clan adored him, fussed over him. His female cousins flirted with him, something they never did with the Don's grandson. Dante, wearing his Renaissance hats, with his sly humor and his short and hugely muscular body, was frightening to these young girls. Dante was too clever not to observe all this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在青少年时代，他对克罗斯·德·莱纳的嫉妒越来越盛。克罗斯那时候已经是身材高挑、英俊非凡、礼节周到的年轻人。克莱里库齐奥家族的所有女人都爱慕他，簇拥着他。他的女性表亲纷纷与他调情，这些事她们可从没对唐的外孙做过。丹特矮壮健硕的身材、顽劣的幽默感，再戴上文艺复兴风格的帽子，只会吓到年轻姑娘。丹特可不笨，把这些全看在眼里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Dante was taken to the Hunting Lodge in the Sierras, he enjoyed trapping more than shooting. When he fell in love with one of the female cousins, as was perfectly natural in the close-knit Clericuzio clan, he was too direct in his advances. And he was too familiar with the daughters of the Clericuzio soldiers who lived in the Bronx Enclave. Finally Giorgio, who had the role of an instructive, punitive parent, enrolled him with the owner of a New York City high-class bordello to quiet him down.</div>

<div class="line_en">As time went on, Dante felt a growing separation from his Family. The Don was as fond of him as ever and made clear to him that he was an heir to the Empire, but he no longer shared his thoughts with his grandson, no longer gave him his insights, his secret little pearls of wisdom.

<div class="line_en">All these things helped Don Clericuzio make his final decision, for the Don could read his grandson's mind as easily as he could read his prayer book. The Don judged that Dante could never take part in the final retreat to the cloak of society. His Santadio and (the Don was a fair man) Clericuzio blood was too ferocious a mixture. Therefore Dante would join the society of Vincent and Petie, of Giorgio and Pippi De Lena. They would all fight the final battle together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一切帮助唐·克莱里库齐奥下了最终决定，唐能轻而易举地看穿外孙的心思，就好像阅读自己的祈祷书一样简单。唐作出决断，丹特不会参加家族融入社会的最终撤退。他身上的桑塔迪奥血脉和（唐是个公正的人）克莱里库齐奥家的血脉，混杂起来太过凶狠。因此，丹特会进入文森特和佩蒂耶、乔治和皮皮·德·莱纳所在的世界。他们会并肩战斗，直到最后一刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dante was clever enough to think that maybe the fault was his, because he had betrayed his knowledge of the massacre of the Santadio and his father. He even asked questions of Petie about Jimmy Santadio, and his uncle told him how much they had respected his father and how sad they had been about his death. It was never said openly, never admitted, but Don Clericuzio and his sons understood that Dante knew the true story, that Rose Marie, in her fits, had disclosed the secret. They wanted to make amends, they treated him as a child prince.</div>

<div class="line_en">And Dante proved to be a good soldier, though an irrepressible one. He had an independence that made him flout the Family rules, and indeed he sometimes did not comply with specific orders. His ferocity was useful when a confused Bruglione or an undisciplined soldier stepped over the Family line and had to be dispatched to a less complex world. Dante was not subject to control except by the Don himself, and mysteriously the Don refused to chastise him personally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而丹特也不负厚望，成了一员出色的悍将，尽管不怎么服管教。他自行其是，蔑视家族规矩，有时候甚至对某些命令充耳不闻。当有昏了头的代理人或不守规矩的兵逾越家族的底线，要被发落去投胎的时候，他的凶狠就派上用场了。除了唐谁也管不住丹特，让人不解的是，唐却不肯亲手严惩丹特。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dante feared for his mother's future. That future depended on the Don, and as her fits occurred more often, Dante could see the Don becoming more impatient. Especially when Rose Marie would make a grand exit by drawing a circle with her foot and then spitting in the middle while screaming she would never enter the house again.

<div class="line_cn" title="丹特使出了全部的魅力，打算给洛西留下个好印象；他的狡狯机敏，戏谑的幽默感，还有他对大众接受的道德准则不屑一顾，这一切都很对洛西胃口。丹特对洛西的战史很感兴趣，故事里洛西对付着破坏西方文明的黑人。丹特本人倒是没有种族歧视。黑人对他的生活没有任何影响，要是有的话，早被无情地除掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dante loved to tell Losey of how he was first the abject extravagant courter of women, and the women were imperious in the power of their beauty. And then how he enjoyed the imperiousness by maneuvering them into a position where they could not escape the unwilling giving of sex. Losey, a little contemptuous of Dante's trick, would tell how he would break women down from the very beginning with his extraordinary macho presence, and then humiliate them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹特喜欢对洛西说自己刚开始追求女人时的糗事，那时候他低声下气、挥霍金钱，但是女人仗着美貌十分傲慢。而之后他又是多么热衷于耍花招把女人带进无法逃跑的绝地，迫使她们上床。洛西有点瞧不上丹特的把戏，自称靠自己出众的男子气概，从最一开始就能斩获女人，然后再羞辱她们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Both of them declared that they would never force a woman to have sex who did not respond to their courtship. They both agreed that Athena Aquitane would be a grand prize if she ever gave them an opening. When they roved around the L. A. clubs together and picked up women, they would compare notes and laugh at those vain women who thought they could go to the utmost limit and then refuse the final act. Sometimes the protests would be too vehement, and then Losey would show his shield and tell the women he would bust them for prostitution. Since many of them were soft hookers, the threat worked.</div>

<div class="line_en">One night after they had dinner at Le Chinois, a restaurant in Venice, Dante suggested they take a stroll along the boardwalk. They sat on a bench and watched the human traffic go by, beautiful young girls on Rollerblades, pimps of all colors pursuing them and shouting endearments, the soft hookers selling T-shirts decorated with sayings incomprehensible to the two men. Hare Krishnas with begging bowls, bearded groups of singers with guitars, family groups with cameras, and reflecting them, the black ocean of the Pacific, on whose sandy beaches isolated twosomes crouched under blankets they believed disguised their fornication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天夜里，他们在威尼斯的“中国人”餐馆用过晚餐，丹特提议去海滨人行道走走。他们坐在长椅上，看着人来人往，漂亮的年轻姑娘们蹬着溜冰鞋，各种肤色的皮条客在后面紧追慢赶，嘴里叫着心肝宝贝，娇滴滴的小婊子卖着T恤，上面写着他俩看不懂的格言。印度教克利须那派教徒捧着乞讨用的饭盆，留着胡子的歌手们背着吉他，全家出游的带着相机，这一切的一切，映在黑沉沉的太平洋海面上。在海滩上，情侣们裹在毯子底下，不消说，肯定是在行苟且之事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there was the soft hooker who loved you but loved others too and established a long-term relationship studded with gifts of jewelry for every holiday, including Labor Day. Then there were the freelance nine-to-five secretaries, airline stewardesses, shop clerks in fancy boutiques, who invited you up to their apartment for coffee after an expensive dinner and then tried to throw you out on your ass to freeze in the street without even a hand job. These were their favorites. Sex with them was exciting, fraught with drama, tears, and subdued cries for forbearance and patience, which produced a sex that was better than love.</div>

On the plantations they were taken care of, three meals a day, free rent, they were clothed and they were given good medical attention because they were valuable property. They weren't even responsible for their children. Imagine. The plantation owners fucked their daughters and gave those children jobs for the rest of their lives. Sure they worked but they were always singing, so how hard could they be working? I'll bet five white guys could do the work of a hundred niggers."</div>
