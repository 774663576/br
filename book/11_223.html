<div class="line_cn" title="“你好！”皮聘说。“您是哪位？有什么需要吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am called Strider," he answered: "and though he may have forgotten it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我叫神行客，”他回答道，“虽然他可能已经忘记了，但之前你的朋友答应要和我谈谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多，皮聘和山姆一起回到了之前的起居室。这里一片黑暗，梅里不在这里，壁炉里的火也快灭了。在他们丢进几捆柴火，把火弄旺之后，这才发现神行客悄无声息的跟着他们走了进来，现在竟然舒舒服服地坐在门边的椅子上！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean?" asked Frodo sharply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这是什么意思？”佛罗多反问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And what will that be, pray?" said Frodo. He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是什么要求呢？”佛罗多说。他怀疑自己已经陷入了恶棍的勒索中，同时不安的想到身上并没有带很多钱。那一点钱根本无法满足一般市井无赖的胃口，而他也不能将这些钱拱手让人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Excellent!" exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably. "You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you what I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when you have heard me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好！”神行客翘起脚，舒服的躺回椅子内。“你头脑终于清醒了些，这对大家都好。之前你实在太不小心了！很好！我会告诉你我所知道的情报，让你决定怎样来报答我。等你听完之后，可能反而会求我和你们一起走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No more than you can afford," answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. "Just this: you must take me along with you, until I wish to leave you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别担心，你一定负担的起，”神行客微笑着说，彷佛他已经猜到佛罗多的想法。“你必须带我同行，直到我决定要离开为止。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, indeed!" replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. "Even if I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your business."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，是吗！”佛罗多有些惊讶的回答，但并不觉得比较放心。“即使我想要有人和我们同行，在我对你了解更多之前，我也不可能答应这件事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go on then!" said Frodo. "What do you know?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就说吧！”佛罗多回答。“你知道些什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Too much; too many dark things," said Strider grimly. "But as for your business --" He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. "I have quick ears," he went on, lowering his voice, "and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to old Bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. Please remember, said one of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I should advise him and his friends to be more careful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太多了，太多不好的消息了，”神行客陰郁的说。“至于有关你的部分——”他猛然起身，拉开门，往四周窥探。最后，他小心的关上门，坐回椅子上。“我听力很好，”他压低声音继续说。“虽然我没办法凭空消失，但我在野外狩猎的经验可以让我在必要的时候不会被人发现。今天傍晚，我正好在布理西边大道围篱旁，那时四名哈比人正好走出古墓岗一带。我应该不需要重复他们对庞巴迪或是彼此之间的交谈，但有件事让我很感兴趣：‘千万别忘记，’其中一个人说。‘绝对不可以提起巴金斯这个名字。如果有人问起，我是山下先生。’这引起了我的好奇心，一路跟随他们到这里来。我紧跟在他们之后溜进村内。或许巴金斯先生有很好的理由隐姓埋名；但就算这样，我也必须建议他和他的朋友们更加小心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret that concerned me and my friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我正在找一个名叫佛罗多—巴金斯的哈比人。我想要尽快找到他。我听说他秘密的离开了夏尔，这件事情让我和朋友们觉得很关切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree," said Frodo angrily, "and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should advise him to explain it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道我的名字为什么会在布理这么引人注意，”佛罗多愤怒的说，“我还想要知道你为什么会感兴趣。或许神行客先生有很好的理由四处打探；但就算这样，我也必须建议他好好解释。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well answered!" said Strider laughing. "But the explanation is simple:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好答案！”神行客笑着说。“不过，我的解释很简单。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, don't mistake me!" he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam jumped up with a scowl. "I shall take more care of the secret than you do. And care is needed!" He leaned forward and looked at them. "Watch every shadow!" he said in a low voice. "Black horsemen have passed through Bree. On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared later, coming up the Greenway from the south."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等等，别误会！”一看到佛罗多突然站起身，山姆也跟着皱眉跳起，神行客连忙说道。“我会比你们更小心保守这个秘密的。千万小心！”他靠向前，看着每个人。“留心每道陰影！”他压低声音说。“这几天有黑骑士经过布理。他们说星期一的时候有名黑骑士从绿大道过来，而稍晚的时候另一名则是从绿大道往南走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: "I ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us," he said. "And the landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the company? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have stayed quiet in here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人一片沉默。最后，佛罗多对皮聘和山姆说：“看到管理员打量我们的样子时我就该猜到了，”他说。“店老板似乎也听说了什么。为什么他会要我们和大家一起同乐？我们又为什么在应该保持低调的时候做出这种傻事？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It would have been better," said Strider. "I would have stopped your going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you, or take a message."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“本来不会这样的，”神行客说。“我本来可以阻止你们跑去饮酒作乐；但是店主不愿意让我见你们，也不愿意帮我传口信。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you think he --" began Frodo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得他会不会——”佛罗多正准备进一步追问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I don't think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort." Frodo gave him a puzzled look. "Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?" said Strider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. "But I hope we shall get to know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened at the end of your song. For that little prank --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我不觉得奶油伯有什么恶意。他只是不喜欢我这种外貌的亡命之徒罢了。”佛罗多困惑的看着他。“你看，我是不是有些潦倒？”神行客露出嘲弄的笑容，眼中闪动着诡异的光芒。“不过，我希望将来有机会让你们多了解一些。到时候，我还希望你可以解释你唱完歌之后为什么要那样做。因为那次愚行——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wonder," said Strider. "Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？”神行客说。“就算是意外好了，那也是让你们陷入危机的意外。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You must not count on that!" said Strider sharply. "They will return. And more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these Riders." He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. "And there are some folk in Bree who are not to be trusted," he went on. "Bill Ferny, for instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his house. You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they slipped out together just after your "accident". Not all of those Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief for amusement."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“千万别小看他们！”神行客不以为然的说。“他们会回来的。而且还有更多骑士会出现。还有其他人。我知道总共有多少名骑士，我知道他们的真实身份。”他停了片刻，露出冰冷、坚决的眼神。“布理也有些人是不能信任的，”他继续说道。“举例来说，比利—羊齿蕨这个家伙就恶名在外，经常会有些形迹可疑的人去他家拜访。你应该也注意到客人之中有这个家伙了吧：他是个有着邪恶笑容的黑皮肤男子。他和其中一名从南方来的陌生人似乎很熟稔，两人在你的‘意外’之后一起悄悄的离开。那些南方人并不是每个都很单纯的，至于比利这个家伙，为了赚钱他什么都肯卖，他甚至也会毫无理由的单纯作弄人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was sheer accident!" interrupted Frodo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那完全是意外！”佛罗多打断他的话声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hardly more than it was already," said Frodo. "I knew these horsemen were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也不会比现在危险多少，”佛罗多说。“我见过那些跟踪我的骑士；他们现在似乎跟丢了，已经跑到别的地方去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"News of you, of course," answered Strider. "An account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people. After that they would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the horsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won't go far. They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you wish them to find you? They are terrible!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然是有关你的消息，”神行客回答。“你刚刚的表现会让某些人很感兴趣。在知道确实的情形之后，你是不是用本名根本不重要了。根据我的推测，他们在明天之前应该就会收到有关你的消息。这样够了吗？接下来你就看着办吧，要不要让我当你们的向导都随你。我对夏尔到迷雾山脉一带都很熟悉，因为我在这边流浪了许多年。我的实际年龄比我的外貌大得多，我应该可以派上用场的。过了今晚之后你们就不能够再走大路了，那些骑士一定会日夜不休的看守着所有的道路。或许你来得及离开布理，只要太陽还没下山，你还可以继续往前走；但你再逃也逃不了多远。他们会在荒野对你动手，让你求助无门。你想要让他们找到你们吗？他们是股无比恐怖的力量！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人看着他，惊讶的发现他脸色苍白，双手紧握着扶手，彷佛十分痛苦一般。房间笼罩在一片死寂中，火光也慢慢变微弱。他就这么楞楞的坐着，彷佛看着遥远过去的回忆，或是倾听着夜色中的动静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?" said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider's hints.</div>

<div class="line_en">"With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no! This Strider here, he warns and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let's begin with him. He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows something, that's plain, and more than I like; but it's no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he puts it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佛罗多先生，请容我说句话。我认为不可以！这位神行客先生警告我们，要我们小心一点，这点我同意。最好就从他开始。他是在荒野中漫游的家伙，这些家伙一向风评很差。他的确知道一些东西，多到让我不放心。但是，这也不代表我们就应该照他的说法，让他带我们到求助无门的荒野中去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was confused with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he broke out:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人陷入沉默。佛罗多没有回答，他的脑中充满了困惑和恐惧。山姆皱着眉头，看着主人，最后终于说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There!" he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. "Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you can. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，”片刻之后他揉着眉心说道，“我想我对这些追兵知道的比你们多。你很害怕他们，但等知道真相之后会更害怕的。如果可以的话，明天你们一定得走。我可以带你们取道无人知晓的小路。你们愿意接受我的帮助吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. "No," he said slowly. "I don't agree. I think, I think you are not really as you choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What do you really know about -- about my business; and how do you know it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘沉吟着，看来相当不安。神行客没有回答山姆的质疑，只是用锐利的眼神看着佛罗多。佛罗多注意到对方的表情，刻意避开他的目光。“不，”他慢慢的说。“我还不同意。我认为……我认为你真实的身份并不像你的外表一样。你一开始的口音像是布理人，但后来你的腔调也改变了。山姆说的没错：我不明白你既然警告我们要小心，又有什么资格要求我们信任你？你为什么要伪装身份？你究竟是谁。你对于魔─对于我的目的又知道多少？你是怎么知道的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's like this," he began, hesitating and looking troubled. "If I've done any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll admit; and I'm a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of Baggins in particular."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是这样的，”他有些迟疑，有些尴尬的说。“如果造成什么不便，我真的很抱歉。可是有许多事情就这么一个接一个的出现，而您也知道，我是个大忙人。幸好，这周的许多事情刚好唤醒了我的回忆，希望这不算太晚。你知道吗，有人请我留意来自夏尔的哈比人，特别是一个叫作巴金斯的哈比人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The lesson in caution has been well learned," said Strider with a grim smile. "But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Still here it is --"</div>

Barley, he says to me," continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. "But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.

Nob's hair was all stood on end. I bid the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they've been asking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear.

<div class="line_en">"I see," laughed Strider. "I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白，”神行客笑着说。“你是指我看起来很邪恶，感觉起来却很善良。对吧？‘精光闪耀非真金，四海云游未迷踪。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did the verses apply to you then?" asked Frodo. "I could not make out what they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么这些诗句描述的就是你罗？”佛罗多问道。“我看不懂这些诗句的内容。可是，如果你没有看过甘道夫的信，又怎么会知道里面有这两句诗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. "I believed that you were a friend before the letter came," he said, "or at least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of his spies would -- well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人沉默了很长的一段时间。最后，佛罗多才迟疑的说。“我在收到信之前就相信你是朋友了，”他说，“至少我希望是这样。今天晚上你已经让我受惊很多次，但都不像是魔王的爪牙会做的事情。我想，他的间谍看起来应该更善良，感觉起来却更邪气逼人；如果你懂我的意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I did not know," he answered. "But I am Aragorn, and those verses go with that name." He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt. "Not much use is it, Sam?" said Strider. "But the time is near when it shall be forged anew."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我其实并不知道，”他回答道。“我是阿拉贡，这些诗句和这个名字是密不可分的。”他拔出剑，众人这才发现那柄剑的确断在剑柄以下一尺的地方。“没什么用，对吧，山姆？”神行客说。“但它重铸的时机就快到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," said Strider, "with Sam's permission we will call that settled. Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，”神行客说，“在山姆的同意之下，我们就这样决定了。由神行客担任诸位的向导。我们明天恐怕会很辛苦。即使我们可以不受阻碍的离开布理，但我们绝无法不被人发现。我会尽量试着甩掉追兵。除了大路之外，我知道有几条别的路可以离开布理。一旦我们摆脱了追兵，我们就立刻前往风云顶。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“风云顶？”山姆问。“那是啥？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have to choose between various dangers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是座山丘，就在大路北边不远的地方。从这边往瑞文戴尔大概走半哩路的地方就是了。上面的视野很好，我们应该有机会看清楚周遭的环境。如果甘道夫跟着我们出发，他应该也会到那边去。过了风云顶之后，我们的旅途就会更颠簸，我们得在不同的危险之间作选择。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"When did you last see Gandalf?" asked Frodo. "Do you know where he is, or what he is doing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你上次看到甘道夫是什么时候？”佛罗多问。“你知道他在哪里，或是他在干什么吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Strider looked grave. "I do not know," he said. "I came west with him in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We last met on the first of May: at Sam Ford down the Brandywine. He told me that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神行客脸色一沉。“我不知道，”他说。“今年春天时我和他一起往西走。过去几年，当他去别的地方出任务的时候，我就会负责监视夏尔的边境。我们上次见面是今年五月一日，在烈酒河下游的萨恩渡口。他告诉我你们所有的计划都很顺利，你会在九月的最后一周出发前往瑞文戴尔。当我知道他会和你们同行之后，我就离开去办我自己的事了。随后状况有了变化，他似乎听到了什么消息，而我又不在他身边帮忙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it -- with Gandalf's absence, I mean?" asked Frodo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你认为黑骑士会不会跟——会不会跟甘道夫的失踪有关？”佛罗多问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should have had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching the East Road anxiously."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是从我认识他之后，第一次感到忧心。即使他没办法亲自来，也应该想办法通知我。我过了很多天之后才回来，却立刻听到不好的消息。一切有了很大的变化，甘道夫失踪了，这些黑骑士开始出没在附近。是个叫吉尔多的精灵告诉我这些事情的；稍后，他们告诉我你已经离开了老家；但没有你离开雄鹿地的消息。于是，我就开始仔细的注意东方大道上的动静。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except the Enemy himself," said Strider. "But do not give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know -- as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除了魔王之外，我不知道世间还有什么力量可以阻挡他，”神行客说。“先别绝望！甘道夫比你们夏尔人所知的要伟大多了；你们只注意到他的笑话和玩具。不过，把我们牵扯进来的这次事件，将会是他最沉重的负担。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippin yawned. "I am sorry," he said, "but I am dead tired. In spite of all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in the dark to look for him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘打了个哈欠。“对不起，”他说，“可是我好困喔。不管前路如何茫茫又危机重重，我都得要上床了，不然就会在椅子上睡着。那个笨梅里到底跑到哪里去了？万一我们还得要出门找他，我可能就要崩溃了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Which way did it go?" asked Strider, suddenly and sharply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它往哪个方向去？”神行客突然插嘴问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was no horse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就在这里，在村子里面。我在房内待了一小时左右。因为你们一直没回来，我就自己出去散步。后来我走回旅店门口，在灯火的范围外看着星光。突然间我打了个寒颤，觉得有什么恐怖的东西靠近了：在路旁的陰影中有道更黑暗的影子，刚好就在灯光照的到的范围外。它一声不响的又溜回黑暗中。附近没有任何的马。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Black Riders!" cried Frodo. "Where?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黑骑士！”佛罗多大喊着。“在哪里？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the passage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob. He shut the door hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: "I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那一刻，他们听见门轰然关上的声音；接着有脚步声一路朝他们冲来。梅里一马当先的冲进房内，后面跟着诺伯。他慌乱的关上门，气喘吁吁的靠在门上。他快喘不过气来了。在他开口之前，所有人都紧张的看着他：“佛罗多，我看见他们了！我看见他们了！那些黑骑士！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Merry started, noticing the stranger for the first time. "Go on!" said Frodo. "This is a friend of Gandalf"s. I will explain later."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward," continued Merry. "I tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它似乎是沿着大道往东走，”梅里继续道。“我试着要跟踪它。它的确消失的无影无踪，但我还是绕过去，一路走到街道的最后一栋屋子去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," said Merry. "Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the other was whispering, or hissing. I couldn't hear a word that was said. I did not creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt terrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when something came behind me and I… I fell over."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道，”梅里说，“我觉得这没什么勇敢，也不怎么愚蠢。我没办法控制自己。我似乎是被吸引过去的。反正，我还是跟着过去了。接着，我在围篱旁边听到了声音。有个人压低声音说话，另一个人则是在耳语，或者说是发出嘶嘶声。我一句话也听不清楚，并且开始浑身发抖，根本无法再靠近。我一害怕就转过身，准备立刻跑回这里，接着有个东西从后面撞上我，我……我就摔倒了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Strider looked at Merry with wonder. "You have a stout heart," he said; "but it was foolish."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I found him, sir," put in Nob. "Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny's house I thought I could see something in the Road. I couldn't swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something, lilting it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there was no signs of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He seemed to be asleep. "I thought I had fallen into deep water," he says to me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he got up and ran back here like a hare."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是我发现他的，大人，”诺伯插嘴道。“奶油伯先生派我拿着油灯出去找他。我先走到西门那边，然后又往南门的方向走。就在比尔的屋子前面，我觉得好像看见路上有什么东西。我不敢打包票，但是我觉得似乎是两个人弯腰看着某样东西，正准备把它抱起来。我大喊一声，可是，当我赶到该地的时候，那两个人都不见了，只剩下烈酒鹿先生躺在路边。他似乎睡着了。‘我觉得好像掉进水里面，’当我摇晃他的时候，他这样对我说。他那时真的很奇怪，等到他神智一清醒之后，他就立刻头也不回的往这边跑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, I think not," said Strider. "They are not all here yet. And in any case that is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people -- not until they are desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when they left him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我不这么想，”神行客说。“他们还没到齐。而且，这也不是他们的作风。在黑暗和面对孤单的旅人时他们的力量最强大。除非别无选择，或者从伊利雅德到这边的领土全部沦陷，否则他们不会轻易攻击这样一个光亮、挤满人的屋子。但，他们的武器是恐惧，布理已经有人在他们的掌握之中。他们会驱使这些仆人进行邪恶的工作。比尔、那些陌生人，或许还有守门人都是他们的爪牙。他们在周一的时候曾经和西门的哈利谈过话。我那时正监视着他们。他们离开的时候，那家伙脸色死白，浑身发抖。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am afraid that's true," said Merry, "though I don't know what I said. I had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went to pieces. I don't know what came over me."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do," said Strider. "The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before we leave Bree."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，”神行客说。“那是黑骑士的吹息。黑骑士一定是把马匹留在外面，秘密的从南门进来。他们已经去找过比尔了，这下一定知道了所有的消息。那个南方人很有可能也是个间谍。在我们离开布理前可能就会有事情发生。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.</div>
