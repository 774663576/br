<div class="line_en">On the 15th of July 1993 the sun rises at 05.01 a. m. Dexter watches it from the back of a decrepit mini-cab as he returns home from a stranger's flat in Brixton. Not a stranger exactly, but a brand new friend, one of many he is making these days, this time a graphic designer called Gibbs or Gibbsy, or was it maybe Biggsy, and his friend, this mad girl called Tara, a tiny birdlike thing with woozy, heavy eyelids and a wide scarlet mouth who doesn't talk much, preferring to communicate through the medium of massage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一九九三年七月十五日，太阳在五点零一分升起。德克斯特搭载一辆破旧的迷你出租车从布里克斯顿一位陌生人的公寓回家，在车后座上看到了日出。其实倒也不是陌生人，而是近来新交的众多朋友中的一个。他是平面设计师，叫吉布西或比格西，有位疯丫头朋友塔拉，一个雏鸟般的小东西，生着一双厚重、微藥的眼睑，一张殷红而寡言的大嘴，传情达意多是通过按摩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These days the nights and mornings have a tendency to bleed into one another. Old-fashioned notions of a. m. and p. m. have become obsolete and Dexter is seeing a lot more dawns than he once used to.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's Tara he meets first, just after two a. m. in the nightclub underneath the railway arches. All night he has noticed her on the dance floor, a broad grin on her pretty pixie face as she appears suddenly behind strangers and starts to rub their shoulders or the small of their backs. Finally it's Dexter's turn, and he nods and smiles and waits for the slow dawn of recognition. Sure enough the girl frowns, brings her fingers close to the tip of his nose and says what they all say now, which is: "You're famous!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他首先认识的是塔拉，凌晨两点后在铁路桥桥拱果的那家夜总会，一整晚他都一直注意着舞池里的她———漂亮的小脸蛋上总绽着笑，突然站在陌生人的身后，摩挲他们的腰背。终于轮到了德克斯特，他点头微笑着，等待着款款而来的相识一刻。当然，那女孩皱着眉头，指尖几乎触到了他的鼻尖，说出了他常听的套话：“你很有名啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The remark is without thought or meaning, but the sentiment seems to move Tara because she says "Aaaaaaaah", stands on tip-toe and rests her little elfin head on his shoulder. "I think you're so lovely," she shouts in his ear, and he doesn't disagree. "You're lovely too," he says, and they find themselves caught in a "you're lovely" loop that could potentially go on forever. They're dancing together now, sucking in their cheeks and grinning at each other and once again Dexter is struck by how easy conversation can be when no-one is in their right mind. In the olden days, when people only had alcohol to fall back on, talking to a girl would involve all kinds of eye-contact, the buying of drinks, hours of formal questioning about books and films, parents and siblings. But these days it's possible to segue almost immediately from "what's your name?" to "show me your tattoo", say, or "what underwear are you wearing?" and surely this has got to be progress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种脱口而出的话毫无意义，然而那种情绪似乎感染了塔拉，她“啊——”地叫着，然后踮起脚尖，将小妖精般的脑袋靠在他肩上。“我觉得你好可爱。”她贴在他耳边喊道，他并不反感。“你也好可爱。”说完他发觉两人已陷人“你好可爱”的怪圈，而且似乎还会绕个没完。他们跳起舞来了，互吻面颊，互相卖笑。而德克斯特震惊地发现，在双方都魂不守舍的状态下展开的交谈竟是如此从容自然。在旧时代，求助的对象唯有酒精，想要搭讪上女孩子则得通过各种的眉来眼去，奉上饮品，正经八百地谈论书籍、电影、父母兄妹，非耗上几小时不可。然时下世风已变，你人可以单刀直人：“你叫什么名字”、“让我看看你的文身吧”，甚至于“你穿着什么样的内裤”。如此进步，想来也是顺理成章。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But I'm strong as an ox," she shouts back over her shoulder and flexes a neat bicep the size of a tangerine. It's such a great little bicep that he is moved to kiss it. "You're nice. You're sooooo nice."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're nice too," he fires back and thinks, God, this is really going just incredibly well, this back and forth, just so well. She's so small and neat that she reminds him of a little wren, but he can't summon up the word "wren" so he takes hold of her hands, pulls her towards him, shouts in her ear, "What's the name of that tiny bird that fits in a matchbox?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也真好。”他立即应道，心想，天哪，这样的一来一往真是美好得不可思议。她如此娇小优雅，让他想到小期鹩，但“熊鹩”这个词他却想不起来，于是抓住她的双手，拉近自己，在她耳边喊道：“像火柴盒那么大的小鸟叫什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she nods, either in agreement or to the music, her heavy eyelids fluttering now, pupils dilated, her eyeballs rolling back in her head like one of those dolls his sister used to have and Dexter has forgotten what he's talking about, is unable for a moment to make sense of anything, so that when Tara takes his hands and squeezes them and tells him once again that he really is lovely and that he must come and meet her friends because they're lovely too, he doesn't disagree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她点点头，也不知是在表示同意还只是和着音乐节拍。此刻她厚重的眼睑忽闪着，眼珠子像他姐姐玩过的那种娃娃的一样溜溜转着。德克斯特忘了自已说了些什么，一下子变得很恍惚。所以，当塔拉捏着他的手，又一次说他可爱，并要把他介绍给她可爱的朋友们时，他毫无异议地接受了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The club is expensive and supposedly upmarket, though Dexter rarely pays for anything these days. It's also a little quiet for a Thursday night, but at least there's none of that scary techno marching music here, or those scary kids, the bony shaven-headed ones who take their shirts off and leer in your face with their teeth bared, their jaws clenched. Instead there are mainly lots of pleasant, attractive, middle-class people in their twenties, people he belongs with, like Tara's friends here, lolling around on big cushions, smoking and talking and chewing. He meets Gibbsy, or was it Biggsy, The Lovely Tash and her boyfriend Stu Stewpot, and Spex who wears spectacles and his boyfriend Mark who, disappointingly, seems to be just called Mark, and they all offer him their gum and water and Marlboro Lights. People make a big deal about friendship but it really does seem incredibly easy here, and soon he is imagining everyone hanging out together, going on holiday in a camper van, having barbecues on the beach as the sun goes down, and they seem to like him too, asking him what it's like, being on TV, asking him what other famous people he's met, and he tells them some salacious gossip and all the while Tara perches behind him, working on his neck and shoulders with her tiny bony fingers, giving him little shudders of elation until suddenly for some reason there's a pause in conversation, perhaps five seconds of silence, but just long enough for a flash of sobriety to take him by surprise and he remembers what he has to do tomorrow, no, not tomorrow, today, oh God, later today, and he feels the night's first shiver of panic and dread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜总会消费很高，自然是个高档场所，不过这种地方如今德克斯特极少掏钱，这个星期四的晚上相对安静一些，至少没有闹腾的电子音乐、恐怖的未成年人，没有光着膀子、瘦骨嶙峋的光头客，他们常会咬牙切齿地狠狠打着你的脸。今夜的来客，主要是些二十多岁、招人喜欢的中产阶级，比方塔拉的朋友们，这正是他所归属的群体。此时他们正懒懒地靠在一个个大垫子上，抽着烟，说着话，嚼着口香糖。他见到了吉布西（还是比格西），可爱的塔什和她的男朋友“司徒·炖锅”，还有戴眼镜的斯派克斯和他的男朋友马克，这名字够让人扫兴的。他们都递给他口香糖、矿泉水和白万宝路。人们常把友谊看得那么重，而和他们建立友谊似乎轻易得有点不可思议。很快他就想象着大伙儿结伴同坐一辆野营车去度假，去海滩，在日落时烧烤。他们也似乎都喜欢他，询问他在电视行业是个什么滋味，见过哪些名人。他就说些花边新闻，这期间塔拉始终趴在他背上，用骨感的手指在他的头颈和双肩上摩挲，让他感到阵阵快意。不知怎的交谈忽然中断了，静默大约持续了五秒钟，却足以让他在一闪念的惊讶中清醒过来，想起了明天要做的事情，不，不是明天，是今天。噢，天哪，就在晚些时候，他感到了当夜的第一阵战栗和恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He looks around for Callum O'Neill, his old flatmate from University and sees him pulling on his coat.

<div class="line_en">As he heads for the exit Dexter imagines the journey home, the menacing crowd of illicit cabbies who will be outside the club, the irrational fear of being murdered, the empty flat in Belsize Park and hours of sleeplessness as he does the washing-up and rearranges his vinyl until the thumping in his head stops and he is able to sleep and face the day, and once again he feels a wave of panic. He needs company. He looks around for a payphone. He could see if Callum's still awake, but male company is no good to him now. He could call Naomi, but she'll be with her boyfriend, or Yolande but she's filming in Barcelona, or Scary Ingrid but she has said that if she sees him again she'll rip his heart out, or Emma, yes Emma, no not Emma, not in this state, she doesn't get it, won't approve. And yet it's Emma that he wants to see the most. Why isn't she with him tonight? He has all these things he wants to ask her like why have they never got together, they'd be great together, a team, a pair, Dex and Em, Em and Dex, everybody says so. He is taken aback by this sudden rush of love he feels for Emma, and he decides to get in a cab to Earls Court and tell her how great she is, how he really, really loves her and how sexy she is if only she knew it and why not just do it, just to see what happens, and if none of that works, even if they just sit up and talk, at least it will be better than being alone tonight. Whatever happens, he mustn't be alone…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出门时德克斯特想着回家的旅程。非法拉客的出租车一定已挤成了一堆，咄咄逼人地守在外面，莫名的恐惧会袭上心头，担心自己会遭遇谋杀。贝尔塞兹公园的公寓里空空荡荡，他会几个小时毫无睡意，洗洗涮涮，整理一番唱片，直到脑袋里的砰砰响声停止后才能睡F，之后是新的一天以及再度的慌张。他需要伙伴，于是四下张望着找寻电话亭。卡勒姆应该还没睡，不过此刻男性伴侣于事无补。内奥米呢？应该和男朋友在一起。约兰德正在巴塞罗那拍片。恐怖的英格丽德吧，已经放话说见到他就把他的心掏出来。再不然还有爱玛，哦，爱玛，不，爱玛不行，这个状况下不行，她不会理解，不会答应的。不过爱玛是他最想见到的。今晚她为何没陪着他？他有那么多事情想要问她，比如他们为何从没有在一起过，他们在一起多棒呀，一定是好团队、好搭档。德克斯和爱姆，爱姆和德克斯，人人都这么说的。对爱姆突然间生出的爱意令他自己也吃了一惊。因此他决定叫一辆出租车去伯爵宫，去告诉她她有多么出色，他又是何等真切地爱她，告诉她她是多么性感，只可惜她自己不知道。为什么不有所行动，看会有何进展。即使一切无果而终，即使仅仅是端坐长谈，全少好过孤零零一个人过漫漫长夜。总之不要独自一人…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it's okay, it's fine, because Tara is saying let's go and dance before it wears off, so they all go and stand in the railway arches in a loose group facing the DJ and the lights, and they dance for a while in the dry ice, grinning and nodding and exchanging that strange puckered frown, eyebrows knitted, but the nodding and grinning are less from elation now, more from a need for reassurance that they're still having fun, that it isn't all about to end. Dexter wonders if he should take his shirt off, that sometimes helps, but the moment has passed. Someone nearby shouts "tune" half-heartedly, but no-one's convinced, there are no tunes. The enemy, self-consciousness, is creeping up on them and Gibbsy or Biggsy is the first to crack, declaring that the music is shit and everyone stops dancing immediately as if a spell has been broken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过幸好塔拉说，趁着兴头再去跳会儿舞吧。于是他们来到铁路桥的桥拱里，松散地站成一排，迎着DJ和灯光，在千冰雾气里跳了一阵，咧着嘴干笑、和着音乐点头、互相皱眉扮怪相。不过此刻的点头和笑脸并非出于由衷的快意，而更多地是为了刻意表示兴致很高，不愿收场。德克斯特不知该不该把衬衫脱了，这样做有时会助兴，不过这会儿大概已经错过了时机。附近有人在半真半假地喊着“好曲子”，没人附和这腾话。一阵不自然的恤怩像敌军般袭击了众人，那个吉布西还是比格西首先发作了，大嚷着说这音乐是大粪，众人应声停下了舞步，如同被巫师破了一道魔咒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The flat is a large space on top of an old pub. Kitchen and living room, bedroom and bathroom are all laid out without walls, the one concession to privacy being the semi-transparent shower curtain that encircles the free-standing toilet. While Biggsy sorts out his decks everyone else goes and lolls in a great tangled pile on the huge four-poster bed, which is covered in ironic acrylic tiger skins and black synthetic sheets. Above the bed is a semi-ironic mirror, and they stare up at it through heavy eyelids, admiring themselves as they sprawl beneath, heads resting in laps, hands searching around for other hands, listening to the music, young and smart, attractive and successful, in the know and not in their right minds, all of them thinking how great they look and what good friends they're going to be from now on. There will be picnics on the Heath, and long lazy Sundays in the pub, and Dexter is enjoying himself once more. "I think you're amazing," someone says to someone else, but it doesn't matter who, because they're all amazing really. People are amazing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公寓位于一家老酒吧的楼上，很是宽敞。体化的厨房、起居室和卧室，唯一一处私密的地方就是遮着半透明浴帘的厕所。趁着吉布西整理房间的工夫，众人横七竖八地瘫倒在巨大的四柱床上。床上铺着内烯酸材质的虎皮和黑色的合成纤维床单，效果颇为搞笑。床的上方是一面哈哈镜，大家都撑开沉重的眼皮盯着它，在音乐声中一边欣赏着镜子里的自己，一边在床上蠕动着，彼此脑袋臀部相抵，一只只手四处乱摸。这些人个个年轻聪明，魅力四射，事业有成，洞察世情，此刻却都神志不清。他们都觉得自己的镜中影像很棒，也相信今后他们就是铁哥们儿。他们会到荒郊野餐，会在小酒昭里共度漫长慵懒的星期天。德克斯特终于再次感到了惬意。“我觉得你真了不起。”不知是谁对谁说道。管他是谁，总之这里人人都很不得了，真的。谁都不得了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The phone is in his hand when, thank God, Biggsy or is it Gibbsy, suggests they all go back to his place, it isn't far, and so they head out of the club, safe in a crowd as they walk back to Coldharbour Lane.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hours slip by with no-one noticing. Someone is talking about sex now, and they compete to make personal revelations that they'll regret in the morning. People are kissing, and Tara is still fiddling with his neck, probing the top of his spine with her hard little fingers, but all the drugs have gone now and what was once a relaxing massage is now a series of jabs and pokes, and when he peers up at Tara's pixie face it suddenly seems pinched and menacing, the mouth too wide, the eyes too round, like some sort of small hairless mammal. He also notices that she's older than he thought -- my God she must be like thirty-eight -- and that there's some sort of white paste between her little teeth, like grouting, and Dexter can no longer control his terror of the day ahead from crawling up his spinal column, dread, fear and shame manifesting itself as a sticky chemical sweat. He sits suddenly, shivers and drags both hands slowly down his face as if physically wiping something away.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is starting to get light. Blackbirds are singing on Coldharbour Lane and he has the sensation, so vivid that it is almost an hallucination, that he is entirely hollow; empty, like an easter egg. Tara the masseuse has created a great twisted knot of tension between his shoulders, the music has stopped, and someone on the bed is asking for tea, and everyone wants tea, tea, tea, so Dexter disentangles himself and crosses to the immense fridge, the same model as his own, sinister and industrial like something you'd find in a genetics lab. He opens the door and stares blankly inside. A salad is rotting in its bag, the plastic swollen and about to burst. His eyes flicker in their sockets, making his vision judder one last time, and coming back into focus he sees a bottle of vodka. Hiding behind the fridge door he drinks a good two inches, washing it down with a sour gulp of apple juice that fizzes repulsively on his tongue. He winces, swallows the liquid down, taking his chewing gum with it. Someone calls for tea again. He finds the milk carton, weighs it in his hand, has an idea.</div>

At twenty-seven she is too old to live like a student anymore, and she now owns a bed, a large wrought-iron and wickerwork affair bought in the summer sales from a colonial-themed store on the Tottenham Court Road. Branded the "Tahiti" it occupies the whole bedroom of her flat off the Earls Court Road. The duvet is goosedown, the sheets are Egyptian cotton which is, the saleswoman informed her, the very best cotton known to man, and all of this signifies a new era of order, independence and maturity. On Sunday mornings she lounges alone on the Tahiti as if it were a raft, and listens to Porgy and Bess and Mazzy Star, old Tom Waits and a quaintly crackling vinyl album of Bach's Cello Suites. She drinks pints of coffee and writes little observations and ideas for stories with her best fountain pen on the linen-white pages of expensive notebooks. Sometimes, when it's going badly, she wonders if what she believes to be a love of the written word is really just a fetish for stationery. The true writer, the born writer, will scribble words on scraps of litter, the back of a bus tickets, on the wall of a cell. Emma is lost on anything less than 120gsm.</div>

Old friendships are holding up, and there are new ones too, with her fellow students from the Teacher Training College. At the weekend she makes full use of the listing magazines, everything except the clubbing section, which might as well be written in runic script for all its talk of shirts-off-up-for-it crowds.

<div class="line_en">At twenty-seven, Emma wonders if she's getting old. She used to pride herself on her refusal to see two sides of an argument, but increasingly she accepts that issues are more ambiguous and complicated than she once thought. Certainly she doesn't understand the next two news items, which concern the Maastricht Treaty and the war in Yugoslavia. Shouldn't she have an opinion, take a side, boycott something? At least with apartheid you knew where you stood. Now there's a war in Europe and she has personally done absolutely nothing to stop it. Too busy shopping for furniture. Unsettled, she throws off her new duvet and slides into the tiny corridor of space between the side of the bed and the walls, shuffling sideways to the hall and into the tiny bathroom, which she never has to wait for because she lives alone. She drops her t-shirt into the wicker laundry basket -- a great deal of wicker in her life since that fateful summer sale on Tottenham Court Road -- puts on her old spectacles and stands naked in front of the mirror, her shoulders pushed back. Could be worse, she thinks and steps into the shower.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dexter's bed is imported, Italian, a low, bare black platform that stands in the centre of the large bare room like a stage or a wrestling ring, both of which functions it sometimes serves. He lies there awake at 9.30, dread and self-loathing combined with sexual frustration. His nerve-endings have been turned up high and there is an unpleasant taste in his mouth, as if his tongue has been coated with hairspray. Suddenly he leaps up and pads across high-gloss black floorboards to the Swedish kitchen. There in the freezer compartment of his large, industrial fridge, he finds a bottle of vodka and he pours an inch into his glass then adds the same amount of orange juice. He reassures himself with the thought that, as he hasn't been to sleep yet, this is not the first drink of the day, but the last drink of last night. Besides, the whole taboo about drinking during daytime is exaggerated; they do it in Europe. The trick is to use the uplift of the booze to counteract the downward tumble of the drugs; he is getting drunk to stay sober which when you think about it is actually pretty sensible. Encouraged by this logic, he pours another inch and a half of vodka, puts on the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack and swaggers to the shower.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stops scatting and tries to steer the car back into the middle lane, but finds that he has forgotten how to steer, his arms locked at the elbows as he tries to physically wrench the wheel from some invisible grasp. Suddenly Dexter's speed has dropped to fifty-eight miles an hour, his feet on the brake and the accelerator simultaneously, and there's another blast of horn from a lorry the size of a house that has appeared behind him. He can see the contorted face of the driver in the rearview mirror, a big bearded man in black mirror shades screaming at him, his face three black holes, like a skull. Dexter wrenches the wheel once more without even checking what is in the slow lane and he is suddenly sure that he is going to die, right here and now, in a ball of searing flame while listening to an extended Jamiroquai remix. But the slow lane is empty, thank God, and he breathes sharply through his mouth, once, twice, three times, like a boxer. He jabs the music off and drives in silence at a steady sixty-eight until he reaches his exit.</div>

"I used to come here years ago," says Dexter, chattily. "Is that right?" replies the gaunt, unhappy man. If the barman recognises him he doesn't say, and Dexter takes a glass in each hand, walks to a table and drinks in silence with the gift-wrapped package in front of him, a little parcel of gaiety in the grim room. He looks around and thinks about how far he's come in the last ten years, and all that he's achieved -- a well-known TV presenter, and not yet twenty-nine years old.</div>

<div class="line_en">His father is already standing in the doorway, as if he's been there for years. He is wearing too many clothes for July; a shirttail is hanging down beneath his sweater, a mug of tea is in his hand. Once a giant to Dexter, he now looks stooped and tired, his long face pale, drawn and lined from the six months in which his wife's condition has deteriorated. He raises his mug in greeting and for a moment Dexter sees himself through his father's eyes, and winces with shame at his shiny shirt, the jaunty way he drives this sporty little car, the raffish noise it makes as it swoops to a halt on the gravel, the chill-out music on the stereo.</div>

She is sitting in an old-fashioned wing-backed chair that has been carried out to face the view across the fields and woods, Oxford a grey hazy smudge in the distance.

He has a sudden urge to cry. He wants to curl up like a child and feel her put her arms around him, and he also wants to run from here as fast as he can, but neither are possible, so instead he trots down the steps, an artificially buoyant jog, a chat-show host.</div>

She exhales deeply, and her breath is sweet and hot on his face. Either she is heavier than he expected or he is weaker than he thought, and he bumps her shoulder against the stair post, then readjusts, turning sideways as he starts to climb the stairs. Her head rests against his shoulder, the headscarf slippery against his face. It feels like a parody of a stock situation, the husband carrying the bride over the threshold perhaps, and several light-hearted remarks run through his head, none of which will make this any easier.

He shakes out two of each and slips them into his wallet, then a third valium, which he swallows with water from the hand basin's tap, just to take the edge off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="撒尿的时候他顺便看了一眼药箱，父亲备有大量安眼药，想是夜里的慌恐，还有一瓶母亲很久以前服用的安定，生产日期是一九八九年，它早已经被更强效的药剂取代。他从两个瓶中各倒出两粒，放进自己的钱夹，而后又倒出一粒安定，放进嘴里，用自来水送下去，中和一下状态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His old bedroom is used for storage now, and he has to squeeze past an old chesterfield, tea chest and cardboard boxes. On the walls, a few dog-eared family snapshots, and his own black and white prints of shells and leaves that he took as a teenager, imperfectly fixed and fading now. Like a child sent to his room he lies on the old double bed, hands behind his head. He had always imagined that some sort of emotional mental equipment was meant to arrive, when he was forty-five, say, or fifty, a kind of kit that would enable him to deal with the impending loss of a parent. If he were only in possession of this equipment, he would be just fine. He would be noble and selfless, wise and philosophical. Perhaps he might even have kids of his own, and would presumably possess the maturity that comes with fatherhood, the understanding of life as a process.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他原先的卧室己成了储藏室，他不得不侧过身，在一张古老的长沙发、一个茶柜和众多纸板箱之间穿行，墙上是家人的快照，嵌在有狗耳朵装饰的相框里。还有他青春期的作品：树叶和海贝的黑白照片，装裱得并不完美，照片本身也退色了，他躺在自己的旧双人床上，双手枕在脑后，像个被强令回房待着的孩子。他总是想象，有朝一日，比如，嗯，到他四十五岁、五十岁的时候吧，会有某些情绪和精神的辅助设备发明出来，大约还是一套工具吧——借之以应付迫近的失去双亲之痛。他会变得超然物外、充满睿智哲思。也许到时候他还会有孩子，想必他也因此而拥有了为人父的成熟，以及对生命的感悟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wakes with a start and looks at his watch, then looks again. 6.26 p. m. He has slept for six hours, clearly impossible, but when he pulls open the curtains the sun is starting to dip in the sky. His head still hurts, his eyes are somehow gummed shut, there's a metallic taste in his mouth, and he is parched and hungrier than he has ever been before. The glass of wine, when he reaches for it, is warm in his hand. He drinks half of it, then recoils -- a fat bluebottle has found its way into the glass and buzzes against his lip. Dexter drops the glass, spilling the wine down his shirt and onto the bed. He stumbles to his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他惊醒过来，看了一眼表，随即又看了一眼：傍晚六点二1六分。他居然睡了六个小时，简直不可思议，打开窗帘一看，夕阳果然已西沉。他的头还在作痛，眼皮似乎要粘在一起，嘴里泛出金属味。他感到前所未有的燥热和饥饿，伸手去够那杯葡萄酒，它已变温。喝下一半后，他猛地往后缩，因为一只肥苍蝇钻进了杯子，在他唇边嗡嗡地唱。德克斯特扔下酒杯，葡萄酒溅了他一身，也溅在了床上。他踉跄地站起来走向卫生间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he isn't forty-five, he is twenty-eight years old. His mother is forty-nine. There has been some terrible mistake, the timing is out, and how can he possibly be expected to deal with this, the sight of his extraordinary mother diminishing like this? It isn't fair on him, not with so many other distractions. He is a busy young man on the edge of a successful career. Expressed in its frankest terms, he has better things to do. He feels another sudden urge to cry, but he hasn't cried for fifteen years, so he puts this down to the chemicals and decides to sleep a little. He balances the glass of wine on a packing case by the side of the bed, and rolls onto his side. Being a decent human being will require effort and energy. A little rest, then he will apologise and show how much he loves her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rural train station is empty. He looks along the length of the platform for the payphone, the old familiar payphone that he used as a teenager to make his plans of escape. It's 6.59 p. m. The London connection will be here in six minutes, but he has to make this call.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乡间的车站空空荡荡。他沿着月台望过去，找寻公用电话，那种他熟悉的旧式投币电话，他十几岁时用来策划离家出走的工具。此刻是傍晚六点五十九分，去往伦敦的火车还有六分钟到站，但他必须打这通电话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At 7 p. m., Emma takes one last look in the mirror to ensure that it doesn't seem as if she has made any kind of effort. The mirror leans precariously against the wall and she knows that it has a foreshortening, hall-of-mirrors effect, but even so she clicks her tongue at her hips, the short legs below her denim skirt. It's too warm for tights but she can't bear the sight of her scuffed red knees so is wearing them anyway. Her hair, newly washed and smelling of something called forest fruits, has fallen into a "do", flicked and fragrant, and she scrubs at it with her fingertips to muss it up, then uses her little finger to wipe smears of lipstick from the corner of her mouth. Her lips are very red, and she wonders if she's overdoing it. After all, nothing's likely to happen, she'll be home by 10.30. She drains the last of a large vodka and tonic, winces as it reacts metallically with the toothpaste, picks up her keys, drops them in her best handbag, and closes the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚七点，爱玛最后照了一眼镜子，确定自己看起来绝对自然，没有雕琢的痕迹。镜子不大牢靠地倚着墙，她知道这会丑化照影，尽管如此，当看着白己的髋部和帆布裙外露出的一截腿，她还是姬着舌头。这个天气穿紧身裤太热了，但那因劳损而发红的膝盖实在难看，所以只能将就。刚洗过的头发散发着一种称之为“森林果”的香气，半挽着，飘逸而芬芳，她用指尖擦了撩，让它略显散乱，又用小拇指擦去了嘴角多余的一抹唇膏。唇色也许是过分红艳了。无论怎样，多半不会发生什么，十点半之前她就会回家了。她将一大杯伏特加兑奎宁水灌下去，跟着一阵批牙瑟缩，因为它与牙膏相互作用，发出金属味。她拿起钥匙，丢进自己最好的手袋里，然后关上门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hi there, Emma, it's Dexter here. What was I going to say? Well I was going to say I'm at this train station near home and I've just come from Mum's and… and I wondered what you were doing tonight. I have tickets for the Jurassic Park premiere! Actually we've missed that I think, but maybe the party afterwards? Me and you? Princess Di will be there. Sorry, I'm waffling, in case you're there. Pick up the phone, Emma. Pick up pick up pick up pick up. No? Okay, well I've just remembered, you have your date tonight, don't you? Your hot date. Well -- have fun, call me when you get in, if you get in. Let me know what happens. Seriously, call me, soon as you can."</div>

For one moment she contemplates running back to answer it but she is late already, and it's probably just her mum or sister to find out how the interview went. At the end of the hall she can hear the lift door opening. She runs to catch it, and the doors of the lift close just as the answering machine picks up.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rails are clicking now, and he can hear the hum of the train approaching, but he can't get on board, not in this state. He'll just have to wait for the next one. The London train arrives and seems to be waiting for him, ticking politely, but Dexter stands shielded by the plastic carapace of the payphone booth, feels his face crumple inwards and his breath become broken and jagged, and as he starts to cry he tells himself that it's just chemical, chemical, chemical.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stumbles, catches his breath, then says: "Just an unbelievably shitty day, Em," and falters again. "I've just done something so, so bad." He should hang up, but he doesn't want to. He wants to see Emma Morley so that he might confess his sins, but she's on a date. He pulls his mouth into a grin and says "I'll call you tomorrow. I want to know everything! Heartbreaker you." He hangs up. Heartbreaker you.</div>
