<div class="line_en">Carrie was an apt student of fortune's ways -- of fortune's superficialities. Seeing a thing, she would immediately set to inquiring how she would look, properly related to it. Be it known that this is not fine feeling, it is not wisdom. The greatest minds are not so afflicted; and on the contrary, the lowest order of mind is not so disturbed. Fine clothes to her were a vast persuasion; they spoke tenderly and Jesuitically for themselves. When she came within earshot of their pleading, desire in her bent a willing ear. The voice of the so-called inanimate! Who shall translate for us the language of the stones?</div>

<div class="line_en">Once these things were in her hand, on her person, she might dream of giving them up; the method by which they came might intrude itself so forcibly that she would ache to be rid of the thought of it, but she would not give them up. "Put on the old clothes -- that torn pair of shoes," was called to her by her conscience in vain. She could possibly have conquered the fear of hunger and gone back; the thought of hard work and a narrow round of suffering would, under the last pressure of conscience, have yielded, but spoil her appearance?-- be old-clothed and poor- appearing?-- never!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些东西一旦拿在手上，穿在身上，她也许会在梦中想到放弃它们。这些东西来路不正的想法也许会使她非常痛苦，使她不愿去想这个问题。但是她绝不会舍得放弃这些东西。她的良心会向她呼吁：“穿上那些旧衣服，穿上那双旧鞋子吧！”但是这些呼吁是徒劳的。她也许能克服对饥饿的恐惧，去过从前的日子。在良心的最后压力下，她也许能克服对做苦工和过狭隘生活的抵触情绪。但是要她损害自己的容颜。要她穿上破衣烂衫，露出一副寒伧相吗？绝对办不到！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Drouet heightened her opinion on this and allied subjects in such a manner as to weaken her power of resisting their influence. It is so easy to do this when the thing opined is in the line of what we desire. In his hearty way, he insisted upon her good looks. He looked at her admiringly, and she took it at its full value. Under the circumstances, she did not need to carry herself as pretty women do. She picked that knowledge up fast enough for herself. Drouet had a habit, characteristic of his kind, of looking after stylishly dressed or pretty women on the street and remarking upon them. He had just enough of the feminine love of dress to be a good judge -- not of intellect, but of clothes. He saw how they set their little feet, how they carried their chins, with what grace and sinuosity they swung their bodies. A dainty, self-conscious swaying of the hips by a woman was to him as alluring as the glint of rare wine to a toper. He would turn and follow the disappearing vision with his eyes. He would thrill as a child with the unhindered passion that was in him. He loved the thing that women love in themselves, grace. At this, their own shrine, he knelt with them, an ardent devotee.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, she is," she returned, cheerfully, a little suggestion of possible defect in herself awakening in her mind. If that was so fine, she must look at it more closely. Instinctively, she felt a desire to imitate it. Surely she could do that too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，她走路姿势很好看。”她愉快地回答，脑子里就想到也许自己在这方面有些小缺陷。既然那人的步态好看，她得更仔细地看看。本能地，她就想模仿那种姿态。当然，她也能这么走的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When one of her mind sees many things emphasized and re- emphasized and admired, she gathers the logic of it and applies accordingly. Drouet was not shrewd enough to see that this was not tactful. He could not see that it would be better to make her feel that she was competing with herself, not others better than herself. He would not have done it with an older, wiser woman, but in Carrie he saw only the novice. Less clever than she, he was naturally unable to comprehend her sensibility. He went on educating and wounding her, a thing rather foolish in one whose admiration for his pupil and victim was apt to grow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像她那么聪明的姑娘一旦看到某些东西被一再强调，受到推崇和赞赏，就会看出这种事的诀窍来，并付诸实践。杜洛埃不够精明，看不出这么做太没有策略了。他本应该让嘉莉和她自己比，而不是和比她自己强的女人比，这样事情会好得多。如果他是在和一个阅历丰富的女子打交道，他不会干出这种蠢事来的。但是他把嘉莉看作一个初出道的黄毛丫头，又没有她聪明，无法理解她的感情。于是他继续开导她，也继续伤害她。对一个自己日益爱慕的女子不断开导和伤害，实在是一件蠢事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not long after she arrived Mrs. Hale established social relations with her, and together they went about. For a long time this was her only companionship, and the gossip of the manager's wife formed the medium through which she saw the world. Such trivialities, such praises of wealth, such conventional expression of morals as sifted through this passive creature's mind, fell upon Carrie and for the while confused her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉搬来不久，海尔太太就和她有了交往，一同出去走走。很长时间，这是她唯一的同伴。经理太太的闲聊成了她认识外部世界的渠道。那些浅薄无聊的东西，那种对财富的崇尚，那些传统的道德观念，从不动脑筋的经理太太那里像筛子一样漏了出来，使嘉莉一时头脑糊涂起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie took the instructions affably. She saw what Drouet liked; in a vague way she saw where he was weak. It lessens a woman's opinion of a man when she learns that his admiration is so pointedly and generously distributed. She sees but one object of supreme compliment in this world, and that is herself. If a man is to succeed with many women, he must be all in all to each.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉心平气和地接受了他的教诲。她看出杜洛埃喜欢的是什么，模模糊糊地也看到了他的缺点。一个女人得知一个男人公然到处留情，她对他的看法就会下降。她认为世上只有一个人配受最高的恭维，那就是她自己。如果一个男人能获得众多女子的欢心，他一定惯于对她们个个灌蜜糖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the same house with her lived an official of one of the theatres, Mr. Frank A. Hale, manager of the Standard, and his wife, a pleasing-looking brunette of thirty-five. They were people of a sort very common in America today, who live respectably from hand to mouth. Hale received a salary of forty- five dollars a week. His wife, quite attractive, affected the feeling of youth, and objected to that sort of home life which means the care of a house and the raising of a family. Like Drouet and Carrie, they also occupied three rooms on the floor above.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie did not make their acquaintance, but she saw the daughter coming in and going out. A few times she had seen her at the piano in the parlour, and not infrequently had heard her play. This young woman was particularly dressy for her station, and wore a jewelled ring or two which flashed upon her white fingers as she played.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉没有和她们结识。但是她看到那个女儿出出进进。有几次她看到她坐在客厅的钢琴前，还经常听到她弹琴。这少女就其身份而言，穿得过份考究。手指上戴着一两枚宝石戒指，弹琴时戒指在她雪白的手指上闪光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other hand, her own feelings were a corrective influence. The constant drag to something better was not to be denied. By those things which address the heart was she steadily recalled. In the apartments across the hall were a young girl and her mother. They were from Evansville, Indiana, the wife and daughter of a railroad treasurer. The daughter was here to study music, the mother to keep her company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一方面，她自己的情感却是一种净化心灵的力量。她内心有一种不断促使她努力向上的力量，这一点是不能否认的。那些情感通过心灵不断地召唤着她。门厅对面的套房里住着一个年轻的姑娘和她母亲。她们是从印第安纳州伊凡斯维城来的，一个铁路会计师的妻子和女儿。女儿来这儿学音乐，母亲来陪伴她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now Carrie was affected by music. Her nervous composition responded to certain strains, much as certain strings of a harp vibrate when a corresponding key of a piano is struck. She was delicately moulded in sentiment, and answered with vague ruminations to certain wistful chords. They awoke longings for those things which she did not have. They caused her to cling closer to things she possessed. One short song the young lady played in a most soulful and tender mood. Carrie heard it through the open door from the parlour below. It was at that hour between afternoon and night when, for the idle, the wanderer, things are apt to take on a wistful aspect. The mind wanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves of withered and departed joys. Carrie sat at her window looking out. Drouet had been away since ten in the morning. She had amused herself with a walk, a book by Bertha M. Clay which Drouet had left there, though she did not wholly enjoy the latter, and by changing her dress for the evening. Now she sat looking out across the park as wistful and depressed as the nature which craves variety and life can be under such circumstances. As she contemplated her new state, the strain from the parlour below stole upward. With it her thoughts became coloured and enmeshed. She reverted to the things which were best and saddest within the small limit of her experience. She became for the moment a repentant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉现在受到了音乐的感染。她的易感的气质和某些乐曲发生了共鸣，就好像竖琴的某根弦会随着钢琴上相应的琴键按动发生共鸣一样。她的情感天生细腻，某些忧伤的曲子在她心里引起了朦胧的沉思，勾起她对自己欠缺的东西的渴望，也使她更依恋自己拥有的美好东西。有一首短歌那位年轻的小姐弹得特别温柔缠绵。嘉莉听到从敞着门的楼下客厅里传出了这支歌。那正是白昼与夜色交替之际。在失业者和流浪汉的眼里，这种时刻给世事蒙上了一层忧伤沉思的色调。思绪转回遥远的过去，带回几束业已干枯的残花，那些消逝的欢乐。嘉莉坐在窗前朝外看着。杜洛埃从上午10点出去还没有回来。她一个人散了一会儿步，看了一会儿贝塞·Ｍ·克莱写的一本书，是杜洛埃丢在那里的。但是她并不怎么喜欢这本书。然后她换了晚装。当她坐在那里看着对面的公园时，正像渴求变化和生命的自然界在这种时刻的情绪一样，她心里充满着企盼和忧愁。正当她思索着自己的新处境时，从楼下的客厅里悄悄传上来那支曲子，使她深受感动，百感交集。她不禁回忆起在她有限的生涯中那些最美好最悲伤的事情，一时间她悔恨自己的失足。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What Drouet said about the girl's grace, as she tripped out evenings accompanied by her mother, caused Carrie to perceive the nature and value of those little modish ways which women adopt when they would presume to be something. She looked in the mirror and pursed up her lips, accompanying it with a little toss of the head, as she had seen the railroad treasurer's daughter do. She caught up her skirts with an easy swing, for had not Drouet remarked that in her and several others, and Carrie was naturally imitative. She began to get the hang of those little things which the pretty woman who has vanity invariably adopts. In short, her knowledge of grace doubled, and with it her appearance changed. She became a girl of considerable taste.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚，那个女孩在母亲的陪伴下迈着轻快的步子外出，杜洛埃对她的风度大加赞赏。这使嘉莉意识到女性那些时髦的姿态和动作的性质和意义：它们使人显得气度高雅，不同凡响。她在镜子面前，学着铁路会计师女儿的样子，噘起嘴唇，同时把头微微一常她轻盈地一摆身子提起裙子——杜洛埃不是在这女孩和别的女人身上一再指出这个动作吗，而嘉莉是天生善于模仿的。她开始学会了那些美貌虚荣的女子无一例外会做的小动作。总之，她关于举止风度的知识大大增加了。她的外表也随之发生了变化：她成了一个风韵不凡的姑娘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Drouet noticed this. He saw the new bow in her hair and the new way of arranging her locks which she affected one morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">She used her feet less heavily, a thing that was brought about by her attempting to imitate the treasurer's daughter's graceful carriage. How much influence the presence of that young woman in the same house had upon her it would be difficult to say. But, because of all these things, when Hurstwood called he had found a young woman who was much more than the Carrie to whom Drouet had first spoken. The primary defects of dress and manner had passed. She was pretty, graceful, rich in the timidity born of uncertainty, and with a something childlike in her large eyes which captured the fancy of this starched and conventional poser among men. It was the ancient attraction of the fresh for the stale. If there was a touch of appreciation left in him for the bloom and unsophistication which is the charm of youth, it rekindled now. He looked into her pretty face and felt the subtle waves of young life radiating therefrom. In that large clear eye he could see nothing that his blase nature could understand as guile. The little vanity, if he could have perceived it there, would have touched him as a pleasant thing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Drouet was just finishing a little incident he was relating, and his face was expanding into a smile, when Hurstwood's eye caught his own. The latter had come in with several friends, and, seeing Drouet and some woman, not Carrie, drew his own conclusion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快讲完一件小趣事时，杜洛埃的脸上绽开了笑容。正在这时，他和赫斯渥的眼光相遇了。赫斯渥正和几个朋友一起进来，一看到杜洛埃和一个女人在一起，而这女人不是嘉莉，他心里马上得出了结论。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Drouet jumped from one easy thought to another as he caught Hurstwood's eye. He felt but very little misgiving, until he saw that Hurstwood was cautiously pretending not to see. Then some of the latter's impression forced itself upon him. He thought of Carrie and their last meeting. By George, he would have to explain this to Hurstwood. Such a chance half-hour with an old friend must not have anything more attached to it than it really warranted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杜洛埃的目光与赫斯渥相遇以后，并没有在意，仍在轻松地想这想那，直到他发现赫斯渥故意装着没看见他，才有点担心起来。接着他注意到后者的一些表情。他想起了嘉莉以及他们上次的见面。老天，他必须跟赫斯渥解释解释。和一个老朋友偶然聊上半个小时不应该引起大惊小怪，把它看得过于严重的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first time he was troubled. Here was a moral complication of which he could not possibly get the ends. Hurstwood would laugh at him for being a fickle boy. He would laugh with Hurstwood. Carrie would never hear, his present companion at table would never know, and yet he could not help feeling that he was getting the worst of it -- there was some faint stigma attached, and he was not guilty. He broke up the dinner by becoming dull, and saw his companion on her car. Then he went home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他有生以来第一次感到良心不安了。这样复杂的道德问题不是他能弄明白的。赫斯渥会笑话他用情不专，他会和赫斯渥一起哈哈大笑。嘉莉不会听到的，现在共餐的女友也不会知道的。但是他不能不感到事情很糟糕——他的名誉沾上了污点，可是他实际上并没有做什么坏事。他无精打采地结束了晚餐，送女友上了车，然后回家了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This pleased Hurstwood immensely. He gave Drouet no credit for any feelings toward Carrie whatever. He envied him, and now, as he looked at the well-dressed jolly salesman, whom he so much liked, the gleam of the rival glowed in his eye. He began to "size up" Drouet from the standpoints of wit and fascination. He began to look to see where he was weak. There was no disputing that, whatever he might think of him as a good fellow, he felt a certain amount of contempt for him as a lover. He could hoodwink him all right. Why, if he would just let Carrie see one such little incident as that of Thursday, it would settle the matter. He ran on in thought, almost exulting, the while he laughed and chatted, and Drouet felt nothing. He had no power of analysing the glance and the atmosphere of a man like Hurstwood. He stood and smiled and accepted the invitation while his friend examined him with the eye of a hawk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫斯渥听了这话很高兴。他不相信杜洛埃对嘉莉有什么感情。看着这个穿着华丽无忧无虑的推销员，他不由妒忌起这个他曾喜欢的人。他开始用情敌的目光，从机智和魅力的角度来打量他，要找出他的弱点所在。毫无疑问，他也许可以把杜洛埃看做好人，但是如果要拿他当情人看，就有点让人看不起。他完全可以把他骗了。对了，如果能让嘉莉看到星期四那类小意外，这事情就算定下来了。他笑着聊天时，脑子里却在转这些念头，几乎有点得意忘形了。可是杜洛埃一点没有觉察，他没有能力分析像赫斯渥那种人的目光和情绪。他站在那里，微笑着接受了邀请，而他的朋友却在用老鹰般的目光打量他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's delightful, delightful," he went on, giving the commonplace rendition of approval which such men know. He sent Drouet after a programme, and then discoursed to Carrie concerning Jefferson as he had heard of him. The former was pleased beyond expression, and was really hypnotised by the environment, the trappings of the box, the elegance of her companion. Several times their eyes accidentally met, and then there poured into hers such a flood of feeling as she had never before experienced. She could not for the moment explain it, for in the next glance or the next move of the hand there was seeming indifference, mingled only with the kindest attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，他真是一个有趣的演员，很讨人喜欢。”他继续说着，用这些人所能想到的泛泛赞语介绍着。他打发杜洛埃去取节目单，把他听来的有关杰佛逊的事说给她听。嘉莉感到说不出的快乐。这里的环境，包厢里的装饰，她同伴的风度——这一切像催眠术一样把她迷住了。好几次他们的目光偶然相遇，于是一股情感的热流从他眼里向她袭来，这是她从来没有经历过的。她无法解释这一点，因为下一次赫斯渥的目光和手势中又似乎只有亲切和殷勤，对她没有一点意见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, indeed," added Drouet, who was not in the least aware that a battle had been fought and his defences weakened. He was like the Emperor of China, who sat glorying in himself, unaware that his fairest provinces were being wrested from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，真令人愉快，”杜洛埃加了一句。他一点也不知道，已经打了一场战争，他的防线被削弱了。他就像中国皇帝坐在龙庭上自鸣得意，不知道他的最好的省份已被人夺去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
