<div class="line_en">This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆说，要是我们能把独木小舟找到一个很好的去处给藏起来，然后把什物放在山洞里，一旦有人到岛上来，我们就能直奔那边。除非带狗来，人家永远也别想能发现我们。再说，他说过，小鸟已经告诉我们说，天快下雨了，难道我乐意叫东西给淋湿么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.</div>

<div class="line_en">We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest – FST! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of treetops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs – where it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在里边铺了些毯子作为地毯，就在那里吃饭。我们把其余的东西放在山洞紧里边顺手拿得到的地方。过了不多久，天黑下来了，只见雪电交作，可见鸟儿的话有道理。接下来，下起了雨。好个倾盆大雨！风又吹得如此猛烈，可是我从没有见到过的。夏天的雷阵雨，就是这样的阵势。天变得一片黑漆漆的，洞外又青又黑，十分好看。雨又急又密，斜打过去，不远处的树木看起来朦朦胧胧，仿佛给一张张蜘蛛网罩住了。突然吹来一阵狂风，把树木吹弯了腰，又把树叶背面苍白的一片片朝天翻起。接着又一阵狂风，但见树枝猛烈摇撼，简直象发了疯的一般。说话间，正当最青最黑的一刹那——唰！天亮得耀眼，只见千万棵树梢在暴风雨中翻滚，和往常不同，连几百码以外也看得清清楚楚。再一刹那间，又是一片漆黑。这时只听得雷声猛烈地炸开，轰隆隆、呼噜噜从天上滚下来，朝地底下滚过去，活象一批空空的木桶在楼梯上往下滚，而且楼梯又长，知道吧，就连滚带跳，不亦乐乎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，我们便往回走，找到了独木小舟，划到了和山洞成一直线的地方，把什物都推进了山洞。等下来，在附近找到了一个地方，把划子藏在密密的柳树丛下。我们从钓鱼竿上取下了几条鱼，再把鱼竿放好，就开始弄中饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞口很宽，连一只大木桶都能滚进去。洞口的一边朝外突出了一小块地方，地势平坦，倒是生火的好地方。我们便在那里生火做饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across – a half a mile – because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大河在十天到十二天中不停地涨水，后来淹没了河岸。岛上低洼处水深三四英尺，还有伊利诺斯州河边低地上也是这样。在这一边，河面有好几英里路宽。不过在伊利诺斯州那一边，还是原来那样的距离——半英里路宽——因为在伊利诺斯州那一边，沿岸尽是一堵堵高墙似的峭壁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles – they would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them. We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大白天，我们坐了划子划遍了岛上各处。即使大太阳在外面晒得热辣辣的，密林深处还是到处树荫，一片阴凉。我们在树丛里穿进穿出。有些地方，藤蔓长得过密，我们得退回来，另找路走。啊，每一棵吹断倒下的老树，都能见到兔子和蛇这类东西，水漫全岛的一两天中，它们因为饿得慌，就变得那么驯顺，你简直可以划近了，高兴的话，可以用手摸它们身子。不过，蛇和鳖可不行——这些东西往往一溜就溜进了水里。我们那个山洞所在的山脊那里，到处是这类东西，你要是高兴的话，可以捉到好多这类玩物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们到岛尾以前，天开始亮了起来。我们就窗口朝里边一望，看得清有一张床，一张桌子，还有两张椅子，地板上各处还有些什物，墙上还挂着几件衣服。屋角里地板上仿佛躺着什么东西，看上去象是一个男子模样。杰姆就说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft – nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches – a solid, level floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一个晚上，我们截到了一小节木筏子——九块松木板。有十二英尺宽，十五六英尺长，筏面露出水面六七英寸，就好象一片结实、平滑的地板。在白昼，有时可以见到锯成的一根根木头淌过，我们听任它们漂去，因为我们白天不露面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got aboard – clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个晚上，天快蒙蒙亮了，我们正在岛尖，上游漂来一座木头房子，是在西边的一头。房子有两层，只见歪歪倒倒的。我们划了过去，爬了上去——从楼上窗口里爬了进去。可是天太黑，看不清楚。我们便把小舟系好，等着天明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe – it might come good. There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我根本没有看他的脸。杰姆扔了几件旧衣服，遮住了他的脸。其实他不需要这么干，我不想看他。油腻腻的纸牌，这儿一堆，那儿一堆，散遍了地板各处。还有威士忌酒瓶，还有黑皮做成的几个面罩。墙上到处都是用木炭涂的字和画，尽是最愚蠢无聊的那一类。还有两件脏旧不堪的花洋布衣服，还有一顶太阳帽和几件女人的内衣，都挂在墙上。墙上还挂着几件男人的衣服。我们把一些东西放到了独木舟里。也许会有用得着的地方吧。地板上有一顶男孩子戴的带花点儿的旧草帽，我把这个也拣了。还有一只瓶子，里面还有牛奶，上面还有一个布奶头，是给婴儿咂奶用的。我们本想把瓶子带走，可是瓶子破了。还有一只破旧的木柜，一只带毛的皮箱，上面的合叶都已经裂开了。皮箱没有上锁，是敞开着的，不过里面并没有什么值钱的东西。从东西凌乱散了一地来看，我们估计，人家是匆匆忙忙离开的，没有来得及定下主意把哪些东西带走。">查看中文翻译</div>
