<div class="line_en">The culture of the Indo-Europeans was influenced most of all by their belief in many gods. This is called polytheism. The names of these gods as well as much of the religious terminology recur throughout the whole Indo-European area. I'll give you a few examples:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="印欧民族相信宇宙间有许多天神（此即所谓的“多神论”），这对他们的文化有很深远的影响。这些天神的名字和许多宗教词汇曾出现在印欧文化所及的各个地区。下面我将举一些例子：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Viking times, people also believed in a special group of fertility gods (such as Niord, Freyr, and Freyja). These gods were referred to by a special collective name, vaner, a word that is related to the Latin name for the goddess of fertility, Venus. Sanskrit has the related word van/, which means "desire."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="古代的北欧人也相信有一群掌管万物生育、生长的神（如尼欧德与芙瑞雅）。这些神有一个通称，叫做vaner，这个字与拉丁文中代表生育之神的字Venus（维纳斯）相近。梵语中也有一个类似的宇叫Vani为“欲望”之意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You probably learned that the old Vikings believed in gods which they called Aser. This is another word we find recurring all over the Indo-European area. In Sanskrit, the ancient classical language of India, the gods are called asura and in Persian Ahura. Another word for "god" is deva in Sanskrit, claeva in Persian, deus in Latin and tivurr in Old Norse.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ancient Indians worshipped the celestial god Dyaus, which in Sanskrit means the sky, day, heaven/ Heaven. In Greek this god is called Zeus, in Latin, Jupiter (actually iov-pater, or "Father Heaven"), and in Old Norse, Tyr. So the names Dyaus, Zeus, lov, and Tyr are dialectal variants of the same word.</div>

<div class="line_en">One could say with some truth that it was no accident that Greek philosophy originated in the Indo-European sphere of culture. Indian, Greek, and Norse mythology all have obvious leanings toward a philosophic, or "speculative," view of the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">We can also see clear similarities in modes of thought across the Indo-European cultures. A typical likeness is the way the world is seen as being the subject of a drama in which the forces of Good and Evil confront each other in a relentless struggle. Indo-Europeans have therefore often tried to "predict" how the battles between Good and Evil will turn out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，很明显的，各印欧文化也有相近的思想模式。最典型的例于是他们都将世界看成善与恶无休无止相互对抗的场所，因此舟欧民族才会经常试图“预测”世界未来的前途。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is also a clear affinity to be observed in some of the Indo-European myths. In Snorri's stories of the Old Norse gods, some of the myths are similar to the myths of India that were handed down from two to three thousand years earlier. Although Snorri's myths reflect the Nordic environment and the Indian myths reflect the Indian, many of them retain traces of a common origin. We can see these traces most clearly in myths about immortal potions and the struggles of the gods against the monsters of chaos.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Indo-Europeans sought "insight" into the history of the world. We can even trace a particular word for "insight" or "knowledge" from one culture to another all over the Indo-European world. In Sanskrit it is vidya. The word is identical to the Greek word idea, which was so important in Plato's philosophy. From Latin, we have the word video, but on Roman ground the word simply means to see. For us, "I see" can mean "I understand," and in the cartoons, a light bulb can flash on above Woody Woodpecker's head when he gets a bright idea. (Not until our own day did "seeing" become synonymous with staring at the TV screen.) In English we know the words wise and wisdom -- in German, wissen (to know). Norwegian has the word viten, which has the same root as the Indian word vidya, the Greek idea, and the Latin video.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="印欧人希望能够“洞察”世界的历史。我们甚至可以发现在各舟欧文化中都有一个特别的字来表示“洞见”或“知识”。在梵语中，这个字是vidya，这个字的意思与希腊文中的idea这个字相当。而idea船此字在柏拉图的哲学中占有很重要的分量。在拉丁文中这个字是video，不过对罗马人来说，这个字只是“看见”的意思。在英文中，Isee可能表示“我懂了”。在卡通影片中，啄木鸟想到一个聪明的办法时，脑袋上方会有灯泡发亮。（到了现代，seeing这个字才变成“盯着电视看”的同义字。）英文中有wise和wisdom这两个字。在德文中有wissen（知道）这个字，在挪威文中则有viten。这些字的来源与印度文中的vidya、希腊文中的idea与拉丁文中的video这些字相同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All in all, we can establish that sight was the most important of the senses for Indo-Europeans. The literature of Indians, Greeks, Persians, and Teutons alike was characterized by great cosmic visions. (There is that word again: "vision" comes from the Latin verb "video."} It was also characteristic for Indo-European culture to make pictures and sculptures of the gods and of mythical events.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总而言之，我们可以断定对印欧人而言，视觉乃是最重要的感官。印度、希腊、波斯与条顿民族（Teutons）的文学都以宏大的宇宙观（cosmic visions）为特色（在这里vision这个字源自拉丁文中的Video这个动词）。此外，印欧文化的另一个特色是经常制作描绘诸神以及神话事件的图画和雕刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lastly, the Indo-Europeans had a cyclical view of history. This is the belief that history goes in circles, just like the seasons of the year. There is thus no beginning and no end to history, but there are different civilizations that rise and fall in an eternal interplay between birth and death.</div>

<div class="line_en">Both of the two great Oriental religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, are Indo-European in origin.

Even today, Hinduism and Buddhism are strongly imbued with philosophical reflection.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not infrequently we find in Hinduism and Buddhism an emphasis on the fact that the deity is present in all things (pantheism) and that man can become one with God through religious insight. (Remember Plotinus, Sophie?) To achieve this requires the practice of deep self-communion or meditation. Therefore in the Orient, passivity and seclusion can be religious ideals. In ancient Greece, too, there were many people who believed in an ascetic, or religiously secluded, way of life for the salvation of the soul Many aspects of medieval monastic life can be traced back to beliefs dating from the Greco-Roman civilization.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们可以发现，印度教与佛教都强调万物皆有神性（此即“泛神论”），并主张人悟道后就可以成佛。（还记得普罗汀的说法吗？）为了要悟道，人必须深深自省或打坐冥想。因此，在东方，清净无为、退隐山林可以成为一种宗教理想。同样的，在古代的希腊，许多人也相信禁欲苦修或不食人间烟火的生活可以使灵魂得救。中世纪僧侣的生活在许多方面就是受到希腊罗马观念的影响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All three Western religions -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- share a Semitic background. The Muslims' holy scripture, the Koran, and the Old Testament were both written in the Semitic family of languages. One of the Old Testament words for "god" has the same semantic root as the Muslim Allah. (The word "allah" means, quite simply, "god.")</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西方三大宗教——犹太教、基督教（注：Christianity，系包括所有信奉基督的教派，最重要的有四种：主要是天主教、基督教、东正教、英国圣公会，其中基督教又称新教，是十六世纪宗教革命后才分出来的）与伊斯兰教——都源出闪族。伊斯兰教的圣经古兰经与基督教的旧约圣经都是以闪族语系的语言写成的。旧约中代表神”的一个字和伊斯兰文中的Allah（“阿拉”，就是“神”的意思）同样都源自闪语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Similarly, the transmigration of the soul, or the cycle of rebirth, is a fundamental belief in many Indo-European cultures. For more than 2,500 years, the ultimate purpose of life for every Indian has been the release from the cycle of rebirth. Plato also believed in the transmigration of the soul.</div>

The Semites originated in the Arabian Peninsula, but they also migrated to different parts of the world. The Jews lived far from their home for more than 2,000 years.

<div class="line_en">When we get to Christianity the picture becomes more complicated.

<div class="line_en">The role played by history is an important feature of these three Western religions. The belief is that God intervenes in the course of history -- even that history exists in order that God may manifest his will in the world, just as he once led Abraham to the "Promised Land," he leads mankind's steps through history to the Day of Judgment. When that day comes, all evil in the world will be destroyed.</div>

In the Old Testament we read how the people "heard" the word of the Lord, and the Jewish prophets usually began their sermons with the words: "Thus spake Jehovah (God)." "Hearing" the word of God is also emphasized in Christianity. The religious ceremonies of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are all characterized by reading aloud or "reciting."</div>

In exchange God promised to protect all the children of Abraham. This covenant was renewed when Moses was given the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai around the year 1200 B. C.

<div class="line_en">I assume you are still with me, Sophie? The key words are "Messiah," "Son of God," and "Kingdom of God." At first it was all taken politically.

Jesus also uses the words "Son of God," the "Kingdom of God," and "redemption." In doing this he maintains the link with the old prophets. He rides into Jerusalem and allows himself to be acclaimed by the crowds as the savior of the people, thus playing directly on the way the old kings were installed in a characteristic "throne accession ritual." He also allows himself to be anointed by the people. "The time is fulfilled," he says, and "the Kingdom of God is at hand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是拿撒勒的耶稣出现了。他不是唯一以“救世主”姿态出现的人，但他同时也使用“上帝之子”、“天国”与“救赎”等字眼，因此保持了他与旧先知之间的联系。他骑马进入耶路撒冷，接受群众赞颂为人民救星，仿佛从前的国王在登基时例行的“加冕典礼”一般。他并接受民众涂油。他说：“时候到了，天国近了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But here is a very important point: Jesus distinguished himself from the other "messiahs" by stating clearly that he was not a military or political rebel. His mission was much greater. He preached salvation and God's forgiveness for everyone. To the people he met on his way he said "Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些都很重要，但请你注意：耶稣不同于其他“救世主”，因为他声明他并非军事或政治叛徒。他的任务要比这伟大得多。他宣称每一个人都可以得到上帝的拯救与赦免，因此他可以置身沿途所见的人群中，对他们说：“你们的罪已经得到赦免了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Handing out the "remission of sins" in this way was totally unheard of. And what was even worse, he addressed God as "Father" (Abba).

<div class="line_cn" title="耶稣用他一生的行动显示，他并不以和妓女，贪污、放高利贷的人与政治颠覆分子交谈为耻。但他所行之事还不止于此；他说一个把父亲的家财挥霍净尽的浪子或一个侵吞公款的卑微税吏只要肯悔改并祈求上帝宽恕，在上帝眼中就是一个义人，因为上帝的恩典浩瀚广大。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a dramatic shift in the meaning of an age-old expression with warlike overtones.

But that was not all, Sophie, he also said that we must love our enemies. When they strike us, we must not retaliate; we must even turn the other cheek.

But, dear Sophie, remember that from a Jewish point of view there was no question of the "immortality of the soul" or any form of "transmigration"; that was a Greek -- and therefore an Indo-European -- thought. According to Christianity there is nothing in man -- no "soul," for example -- that is in itself immortal.

Even from this visit of Paul in Athens we sense a coming collision between Greek philosophy and the doctrine of Christian redemption.

<div class="line_en">Paul in Athens, Sophie! Christianity has begun to penetrate the Greco-Roman world as something else, something completely different from Epicurean, Stoic, or Neoplatonic philosophy. But Paul nevertheless finds some common ground in this culture. He emphasizes that the search for God is natural to all men. This was not new to the Greeks. But what was new in Paul's preaching is that God has also revealed himself to mankind and has in truth reached out to them. So he is no longer a "philosophic God" that people can approach with their understanding. Neither is he "an image of gold or silver or stone"-- there were plenty of those both on the Acropolis and down in the marketplace! He is a God that "dwelleth not in temples made with hands." He is a personal God who intervenes in the course of history and dies on the Cross for the sake of mankind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从保罗到雅典传教开始，基督教会就逐渐渗透希腊罗马地区。它虽不同于希腊原有的伊比鸠鲁学派、斯多葛学派或新柏拉图哲学，但保罗仍然在两者间找到了共同点。他强调世人皆试图寻找上帝。对希腊人而言这并非新的概念，但是保罗声称上帝已经向人类显现他自己，并且实际上已经把手伸给人类，因此他不再是一位人们可用理性来了解的“哲学的上帝”，也不是“金、银、石雕刻的偶像”（这两者在希腊的卫城与市集中到处都是），而是一位“不住人手所造殿”的神，也是一位会干预历史发展方向，并为世人而死在十字架上的人形的神。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One important question in the early years after Jesus was whether non-Jews could become Christians without first becoming Jews. Should a Greek, for instance, observe the dietary laws? Paul believed it to be unnecessary. Christianity was more than a Jewish sect. It addressed itself to everybody in a universal message of salvation. The "Old Covenant" between God and Israel had been replaced by the "New Covenant" which Jesus had established between God and mankind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="耶稣受难后的最初几年中，基督教面临一个很重要的问题是：非犹太人（外邦人）是否可以成为基督徒？还是一定要先归化为犹太人才可以？又，外邦人——如希腊人——应该遵守十诫吗？保罗认为，外邦人不一定要成为犹太人才可以信奉基督教，因为基督教不只是犹太人的宗教。它的目标在拯救全体世人。上帝与以色列订的“旧约”已经由耶稣代表上帝与人类订的“新约”所取代。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Paul had made his speech on the Areopagos, we read in the Acts of the Apostles, some mocked him for what he said about the resurrection from the dead. But others said: "We will hear thee again of this matter." There were also some who followed Paul and began to believe in Christianity. One of them, it is worth noting, was a woman named Damaris. Women were amongst the most fervent converts to Christianity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="根据使徒行传的记载，保罗在最高法院小丘发表演讲，提到耶稣死而复活的事时，有人就讥笑他，但也有人说：“我们再听你讲这个吧。”有些人后来追随保罗，开始信奉基督教，其中有一个女人名叫大马哩（Damaris）。这件事之所以特别值得一提，是因为妇女是最热切信奉基督教的族群之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Paul continued his missionary activities. A few decades after the death of Jesus, Christian congregations were already established in all the important Greek and Roman cities -- in Athens, in Rome, in Alexandria, in Ephesos, and in Corinth. In the space of three to four hundred years, the entire Hellenistic world had become Christian.</div>

<div class="line_en">This may sound like a contradiction. But the message of the church was precisely that God became man. Jesus was not a "demigod" (which was half man, half god). Belief in such "demigods" was quite widespread in Greek and Hellenistic religions. The church taught that Jesus was "perfect God, perfect man."</div>

<div class="line_en">Let me try to say a few words about how all this hangs together, my dear Sophie. As Christianity makes its entry into the Greco-Roman world we are witnessing a dramatic meeting of two cultures. We are also seeing one of history's great cultural revolutions.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, Christianity was not the only religion at that time. We have seen how Hellenism was influenced by a fusion of religions. It was thus vitally necessary for the church to step forward with a concise summary of the Christian doctrine, both in order to distance itself from other religions and to prevent schisms within the Christian Church. Therefore the first Creed was established, summing up the central Christian "dogmas" or tenets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何，基督教并非当时唯一的宗教。我们已经看到希腊文化如何受到各种宗教的影响，因此，为了显示与其他宗教有别，也为了防止教会内部分裂，基督教会认为有必要提出一套简明扼要的教义。因此他们写成了第一部《使徒信经》（Creed），总结基督徒教义的中心“信条”或主要教义。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One such central tenet was that Jesus was both God and man. He was not the "Son of God" on the strength of his actions alone. He was God himself. But he was also a "true man" who had shared the misfortunes of mankind and actually suffered on the Cross.</div>
