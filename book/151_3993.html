<div class="line_en">Out of the three of us, Miranda had almost always been the sweetest to August, hugging him and playing with him long after Ella and I had moved on to playing something else. Even as we got older, Miranda always made sure to try to include August in our conversations, ask him how he was doing, talk to him about Avatar or Star Wars or Bone or something she knew he liked. It was Miranda who had given Auggie the astronaut helmet he wore practically every day of the year when he was five or six. She would call him Major Tom and they would sing "Space Oddity" by David Bowie together. It was their little thing. They knew all the words and would blast it on the iPod and sing the song out loud.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I realized from her Facebook wall that she'd actually been back home for a full two weeks, so I sent her an IM and we chatted online a bit, but she didn't give me a reason for not calling, which I thought was bizarre. Miranda had always been a little flaky, so I figured that's all it was. We made plans to meet downtown, but then I had to cancel because we were driving out to visit Tata and Poppa for the weekend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，我看了她在脸书（Facebook）的留言板，才明白她已经回来整整两个星期了。于是，我给她发了IM（即时通讯），在网上聊了一会儿，但是她也没有告诉我不打电话来的原因，这让我觉得有点奇怪。米兰达一向有点古怪，我以为仅此而已。我们计划在市区碰头，但后来又不得不取消，因为周末我们要开车去看爷爷奶奶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since Miranda's always been really good about calling us as soon as she got home from summer camp, I was a little surprised when I didn't hear from her. I even texted her and she didn't reply. I figured maybe she had ended up staying in the camp longer, now that she was a counselor. Maybe she met a cute guy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米兰达从夏令营回到家，从来都是马上打电话给我们，所以没接到她的电话，我有点奇怪。我甚至还给她发了短信，她也没回。我想，既然她现在是辅导员，可能最后要在夏令营多待一段时间。有可能她还遇到了一个可爱的男生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So I ended up not seeing either Miranda or Ella until the first day of school. And, I have to admit, I was shocked. Miranda looked so different: her hair was cut in this super-cute bob that she'd dyed bright pink, of all things, and she was wearing a striped tube top that (a) seemed way inappropriate for school, and (b) was totally not her usual style. Miranda had always been such a prude about clothes, and here she was all pink-haired and tube-topped. But it wasn't just the way she looked that was different: she was acting differently, too. I can't say she wasn't nice, because she was, but she seemed kind of distant, like I was a casual friend. It was the weirdest thing in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，直到开学第一天，我才终于见到米兰达和艾拉。而且我不得不承认，我吓了一大跳。米兰达变得面目全非：头发剪成了超级萌的波波头，还染成了亮粉色，最让我没想到的是，她只穿了一件条纹直筒式抹胸，（a）似乎校园不宜，（b）也完全不是她一贯的风格。米兰达穿衣服通常很古板，但是她现在一头粉色头发，只穿一件抹胸。让她变得面目全非的还不仅仅是外表：她的行为也大相径庭。我不能说她不好看，因为她挺漂亮的，但是她看起来有些疏远，就像我只是一个普通朋友而已。这真是匪夷所思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At lunch the three of us sat together like we always used to, but the dynamics had shifted. It was obvious to me that Ella and Miranda had gotten together a few times during the summer without me, though they never actually said that. I pretended not to be at all upset while we talked, though I could feel my face getting hot, my smile being fake. Although Ella wasn't as over-the-top as Miranda, I noticed a change in her usual style, too. It's like they had talked to each other beforehand about redoing their image at the new school, but hadn't bothered to clue me in. I admit: I had always thought I was above this kind of typical teenage pettiness, but I felt a lump in my throat throughout lunch. My voice quivered as I said "See you later" when the bell rang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午餐的时候，我们三个人像往常一样坐在一起，但是气氛变了。我明显感觉到，艾拉和米兰达在暑假期间单独聚过几次，但是她们绝口不提。聊天的时候，我假装自己一点都不难过，但是我可以感觉到自己面红耳赤，强颜欢笑。虽然艾拉不像米兰达那样只穿一件抹胸，但我发现她的装束也与平常有些不同。她们好像事先商量好到新学校要有新形象，但是不愿意告诉我。我承认，我一直觉得少男少女的鸡毛蒜皮跟我无关，但是整个午餐我一直喉咙哽咽着。上课铃响起时，我颤声说了一句“再见”。">查看中文翻译</div>
