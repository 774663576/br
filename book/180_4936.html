<div class="line_en">No, she thought, putting together some of the pictures he had cut out -- a refrigerator, a mowing machine, a gentleman in evening dress -- children never forget. For this reason, it was so important what one said, and what one did, and it was a relief when they went to bed. For now she need not think about anybody. She could be herself, by herself. And that was what now she often felt the need of -- to think; well, not even to think. To be silent; to be alone. All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others. Although she continued to knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt herself; and this self having shed its attachments was free for the strangest adventures. When life sank down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless. And to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources, she supposed; one after another, she, Lily, Augustus Carmichael, must feel, our apparitions, the things you know us by, are simply childish. Beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is unfathomably deep; but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by. Her horizon seemed to her limitless. There were all the places she had not seen; the Indian plains; she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in Rome. saw it. They could not stop it, she thought, exulting. There was freedom, there was peace, there was, most welcome of all, a summoning together, a resting on a platform of stability. Not as oneself did one find rest ever, in her experience (she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles) but as a wedge of darkness. Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry, the stir; and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace, this rest, this eternity; and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the Lighthouse, the long steady stroke, the last of the three, which was her stroke, for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw; and this thing, the long steady stroke, was her stroke. Often she found herself sitting and looking, sitting and looking, with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at -- that light, for example. And it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that --"Children don't forget, children don't forget"-- which she would repeat and begin adding to it, It will end, it will end, she said. It will come, it will come, when suddenly she added, We are in the hands of the Lord.</div>

<div class="line_en">But instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that. Who had said it? Not she; she had been trapped into saying something she did not mean. She looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes, searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart, purifying out of existence that lie, any lie. She praised herself in praising the light, without vanity, for she was stern, she was searching, she was beautiful like that light. It was odd, she thought, how if one was alone, one leant to inanimate things; trees, streams, flowers; felt they expressed one; felt they became one; felt they knew one, in a sense were one; felt an irrational tenderness thus (she looked at that long steady light) as for oneself. There rose, and she looked and looked with her needles suspended, there curled up off the floor of the mind, rose from the lake of one's being, a mist, a bride to meet her lover.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她马上就为自己说了这样的话而生气。这话是谁说的？不是她，她是不小心说了不是她本意的话。她从织的毛线活上抬起眼睛，眼光和第二道光束相遇，她觉得就像她自己和自己的目光相遇，只有她才能这样探索自己思想和心灵的深处，把那个谎言、任何谎言涤除干净。她在赞美那道闪光时也毫无自负感地赞美了自己，因为她和灯塔的闪光一样严厉、一样洞察、—样美丽。这真奇怪，她自思，—个人如果独处，怎么就会偏向于东西，无生命的东西；树木、溪流、鲜花；感到它们表达了你；感到它们成了你；感到它们懂得你，从某种意义上说就是你；感到一种无法理喻的柔情（她看着那道长而稳定的光束），就像是对自己的一种柔情。她手中的毛衣针停在那儿一动不动，专注地看啊看，这时从她的心底缭绕飘起、从她生命的湖上升起了一层薄雾，一位新娘来迎接她所爱之人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What brought her to say that: "We are in the hands of the Lord?" she wondered. The insincerity slipping in among the truths roused her, annoyed her. She returned to her knitting again. How could any Lord have made this world? she asked. With her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason, order, justice: but suffering, death, the poor. There was no treachery too base for the world to commit; she knew that. No happiness lasted; she knew that. She knitted with firm composure, slightly pursing her lips and, without being aware of it, so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed, though he was chuckling at the thought that Hume, the philosopher, grown enormously fat, had stuck in a bog, he could not help noting, as he passed, the sternness at the heart of her beauty. It saddened him, and her remoteness pained him, and he felt, as he passed, that he could not protect her, and, when he reached the hedge, he was sad. He could do nothing to help her. He must stand by and watch her. Indeed, the infernal truth was, he made things worse for her. He was irritable -- he was touchy. He had lost his temper over the Lighthouse. He looked into the hedge, into its intricacy, its darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她怎么会说出“我们都在上帝的手心里”这么—句话来的？她感到奇怪。在真话里不知不觉溜进来的不实之辞使她恼怒不快。她又接着织毛袜。哪一个上帝能创造出这个世界来？她自问。她头脑中一直紧抓着这个事实，世上没有理性、秩序、公正；有的只是痛苫、死亡、穷人。无论什么样卑鄙的背信弃义行为在这个世界上都会出现；她知道这一点。没有长久的幸福；她知道这一点。她十分沉着地织着袜子，嘴唇微微缩拢。自己也没有意识到，在习惯性的严峻神情下她的脸部线条变得僵硬镇静。以至当她的丈夫经过时，虽然心里正在想哲学家休谟长得如此肥胖臃肿，陷进了泥沼。因而咯咯笑了起来，也不由自主地注意到存在于她的美貌深处的严峻，这使他感到悲哀。她的冷漠令他痛苦，他走过她身边时感觉到自己无法保护她，当他来到树篱前时，心里很难过。他无法帮助她。他只能站在一旁看着她。而且，可恨的事实是，他使她情况更糟。他易怒——容易因小事生气。为灯塔的事他发了脾气。他往树篱中看去，看着它交错的枝条，看着它那黑暗的深处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Always, Mrs Ramsay felt, one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end, some sound, some sight. She listened, but it was all very still; cricket was over; the children were in their baths; there was only the sound of the sea. She stopped knitting; she held the long reddish-brown stocking dangling in her hands a moment. She saw the light again. With some irony in her interrogation, for when one woke at all, one's relations changed, she looked at the steady light, the pitiless, the remorseless, which was so much her, yet so little her, which had her at its beck and call (she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed, stroking the floor), but for all that she thought, watching it with fascination, hypnotised, as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight, she had known happiness, exquisite happiness, intense happiness, and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly, as daylight faded, and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt, It is enough! It is enough!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人，拉姆齐夫人觉得，总是抓着一些零星事物不情愿地把自己从孤独中摆脱出来，如某种声音、某种景象。她侧耳倾听，但四周一片静寂；板球已经打完了；孩子们都在洗澡；只有大海的潮声。她停止了编织；拿赵21棕色长袜的一头，让袜子在手里垂了一会儿。她又看见了那道光束。她看着这道稳定的光束，在她的疑问中带有讽刺，因为当人一旦醒来，各种关系就变了，灯塔光束的无情与冷酷，和她是如此相像又如此不同，使她俯首听命（她夜里醒来，看到它俯身越过他们的床铺，投到地板上），但是尽管她有这些想法，她仍着迷地、神魂颠倒地看着它，仿佛它在用银色的手指轻抚着她大脑中某条未知的脉管，这脉管的破裂将使她充满快乐，她曾经体会过幸福，极度的幸福、强烈的幸福，灯塔的银白色光芒使波涛汹涌的海面稍稍明亮了—点，当天光消退，大海失去了蔚蓝的颜色，灯塔的银光随着纯柠檬色的海浪翻滚涌涨，击碎在海滩上，她眼中涌出狂喜，无限的快乐之波卷过心田，于是她感到，足够了！这就足够了！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned and saw her. Ah! She was lovely, lovelier now than ever he thought. But he could not speak to her. He could not interrupt her. He wanted urgently to speak to her now that James was gone and she was alone at last. But he resolved, no; he would not interrupt her. She was aloof from him now in her beauty, in her sadness. He would let her be, and he passed her without a word, though it hurt him that she should look so distant, and he could not reach her, he could do nothing to help her. And again he would have passed her without a word had she not, at that very moment, given him of her own free will what she knew he would never ask, and called to him and taken the green shawl off the picture frame, and gone to him. For he wished, she knew, to protect her.</div>
