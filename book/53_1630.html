<div class="line_en">I stop trying to sleep after my first few attempts are interrupted by unspeakable nightmares. After that, I just lie still and do fake breathing whenever someone checks on me. In the morning, I'm released from the hospital and instructed to take it easy. Cressida asks me to record a few lines for a new Mockingjay propo. At lunch, I keep waiting for people to bring up Peeta's appearance, but no one does. Someone must have seen it besides Finnick and me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Under this debate lies the real source of my distress: Peeta. What have they done to him? And what are they doing to him right now? Clearly, Snow did not buy the story that Peeta and I knew nothing about the rebellion. And his suspicions have been reinforced, now that I have come out as the Mockingjay. Peeta can only guess about the rebel tactics or make up things to tell his torturers. Lies, once discovered, would be severely punished. How abandoned by me he must feel. In his first interview, he tried to protect me from the Capitol and rebels alike, and not only have I failed to protect him, I've brought down more horrors upon him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这一切争论的背后，真正让我痛苦的是皮塔。他们是怎么对待他的？正在对他做什么？显然，斯诺并不相信皮塔和我对反叛的事毫不知情，而我成了嘲笑鸟，却进一步证实了他的怀疑。皮塔只能凭想象来猜测当时发生的事，来敷衍那些折磨他的人。谎言，一旦被发现，就会招来更严厉的惩罚。他一定感觉我背叛了他。在第一次采访时，他还试图保护我和其他的反叛者。而我，不仅没能保护他，反而给他招来了更多麻烦。清晨，我把胳膊支在墙壁上，使劲地盯着我的时间表看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For dinner, there's minced venison in the stew. Gale walks me back to Compartment E after we eat. When I ask him what's been going on, again there's no mention of Peeta. As soon as my mother and sister are asleep, I slip the pearl from the drawer and spend a second sleepless night clutching it in my hand, replaying Peeta's words in my head. "Ask yourself, do you really trust the people you're working with? Do you really know what's going on? And if you don't… find out." Find out. What? From who? And how can Peeta know anything except what the Capitol tells him? It's just a Capitol propo. More noise. But if Plutarch thinks it's just the Capitol line, why didn't he tell me about it? Why hasn't anyone let me or Finnick know?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃饭时，炖菜里有剁碎的鹿肉。我们吃完饭后，盖尔把我送到E房间。当我问起他情况怎样时，他仍没有提起皮塔的事。夜晚，妈妈和妹妹刚坠入梦乡，我就从抽屉里拿出那颗珍珠，紧紧地握在手里。又是一个不眠之夜，我整晚都在脑子里翻腾皮塔的那句话，“问问你自己，真的信任那些和你一起的入吗？你真的知道正在发生的是什么吗？如果你不知道…那就找出答案。”找出答案？什么答案？从谁那里找到？除了凯匹特告诉皮塔的，他又怎么知道其他的事情？这不过是凯匹特的电视宣传而已，一阵噪声。可如果普鲁塔什认为这不过是凯匹特炮制的骗人把戏，那这件事他干吗不告诉我？为什么没人让我或者芬尼克知道这事？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="按时间表，早饭后我要去制造部。在餐厅里，当我拿着热米饭、牛奶和甜菜粥往餐桌走时，不经意间看到盖尔的手腕上有一个卡米特。“你什么时候把它弄回来的，霍桑战士？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment, real hurt registers on his face. Then cold anger replaces it. He turns on his heel and goes. Maybe I have been too spiteful, not given him enough time to explain. Maybe everyone is just trying to protect me by lying to me. I don't care. I'm sick of people lying to me for my own good. Because really it's mostly for their own good. Lie to Katniss about the rebellion so she doesn't do anything crazy. Send her into the arena without a clue so we can fish her out. Don't tell her about Peeta's propo because it might make her sick, and it's hard enough to get a decent performance out of her as it is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那一瞬间，我看到盖尔的脸上露出痛苦的表情，接着，又变成了一脸的愤怒。他猛地转身走了。也许我的话太尖刻了，也没有给他解释的时间。也许每个人都为了保护我而向我撒谎。我不在乎。我已经厌倦了人们为了我而对我撒谎。其实这样做归根到底还是为了他们自己。反抗计划要瞒过凯特尼斯，免得她做出什么疯狂的事；进竞技场时不能向她透露任何消息，以便成功地将她救出；皮塔电视采访的事别告诉她，不然她会生病，本来让她进入良好状态已经够难了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the last moment, I remember to send a message to my mother about my leaving 13, and stress that it won't be dangerous. We board a hovercraft for the short ride to 12 and I'm directed to a seat at a table where Plutarch, Gale, and Cressida are poring over a map. Plutarch's brimming with satisfaction as he shows me the before/after effects of the first couple of propos. The rebels, who were barely maintaining a foothold in several districts, have rallied. They have actually taken 3 and 11 -- the latter so crucial since it's Panem's main food supplier -- and have made inroads in several other districts as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="临走前，我想起了给妈妈送个信儿，告诉她我要离开十三区，特别说明这次任务并不危险。我们要乘直升机飞到距此不远的十二区，上了飞机，有人指示我坐到一张桌子旁，普鲁塔什、盖尔和克蕾西达正趴在桌子上仔细研究一张地图。普鲁塔什很满意地告诉我节目播放前后发生的变化。之前，几个区的反抗者几乎没有立锥之地，而之后他们联合了起来。反抗者已经夺取了三区和十一区——夺取十一区尤为重要，因为它是帕纳姆的粮仓一并对其他几个区发起进攻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I roll my eyes, long out of patience with my mentor, his weakness for drink, and what he can or can't confront. But about five minutes after my return to 12, I'm wishing I had a bottle myself. I thought I'd come to terms with 12's demise -- heard of it, seen it from the air, and wandered through its ashes. So why does everything bring on a fresh pang of grief? Was I simply too out of it before to fully register the loss of my world?

<div class="line_en">Gale doesn't get off so easily at his old address. Cressida films him in silence for a few minutes, but just as he pulls the one remnant of his previous life from the ashes -- a twisted metal poker -- she starts to question him about his family, his job, life in the Seam. She makes him go back to the night of the firebombing and reenact it, starting at his house, working his way down across the Meadow and through the woods to the lake. I straggle behind the film crew and the bodyguards, feeling their presence to be a violation of my beloved woods. This is a private place, a sanctuary, already corrupted by the Capitol's evil. Even after we've left behind the charred stumps near the fence, we're still tripping over decomposing bodies. Do we have to record it for everyone to see?</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheese sandwiches are passed around and we eat them in the shade of the trees. I intentionally sit at the far edge of the group, next to Pollux, so I don't have to talk. No one's talking much, really. In the relative quiet, the birds take back the woods. I nudge Pollux with my elbow and point out a small black bird with a crown. It hops to a new branch, momentarily opening its wings, showing off its white patches. Pollux gestures to my pin and raises his eyebrows questioningly. I nod, confirming it's a mockingjay. I hold up one finger to say Wait, I'll show you, and whistle a birdcall. The mockingjay cocks its head and whistles the call right back at me. Then, to my surprise, Pollux whistles a few notes of his own. The bird answers him immediately. Pollux's face breaks into an expression of delight and he has a series of melodic exchanges with the mockingjay. My guess is it's the first conversation he's had in years. Music draws mockingjays like blossoms do bees, and in a short while he's got half a dozen of them perched in the branches over our heads. He taps me on the arm and uses a twig to write a word in the dirt. SING?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人拿来了奶酪三明治，我们都在树阴下吃起来。我故意坐在波洛斯身边，离大家比较远的地方，免得还要跟人说话。大家其实也都没怎么说话。在这种相对较为安静的时候，能听到鸟儿的呜叫。我用胳膊肘捅了一下波洛斯，把一只小小的带鸟冠的黑鸟指给他看。鸟儿在树枝间跳跃，偶尔展开翅膀，露出里面白色的羽毛。波洛斯指指我的胸针，然后询问似的扬起眉毛。我点点头，向他确认这是一只嘲笑鸟。我竖起一根手指，向他示意等等，我让它叫给你看，然后吹哨模仿鸟的叫声，嘲笑鸟翘起脑袋，立刻也模仿我的声音叫了起来。接着，令我吃惊的是，波洛斯用哨声吹出了自己的调子，鸟儿马上也学着他叫了起来。波洛斯的脸上立刻绽出了快乐的微笑，他一连吹了几个小调，与鸟儿进行应答。我猜这是他几年来第一次真正的交流。和谐的小调吸引着嘲笑鸟，就像花儿吸引着蜜蜂。不一会儿，他的哨声吸引来了六七只鸟儿停在我们头顶的树枝上。他拍拍我的胳膊，用树枝在土地上写了三个字，唱歌吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time we reach the lake, Gale seems to have lost his ability to speak. Everyone's dripping in sweat -- especially Castor and Pollux in their insect shells -- and Cressida calls for a break. I scoop up handfuls of water from the lake, wishing I could dive in and surface alone and naked and unobserved. I wander around the perimeter for a while. When I come back around to the little concrete house beside the lake, I pause in the doorway and see Gale propping the crooked poker he salvaged against the wall by the hearth. For a moment I have an image of a lone stranger, sometime far in the future, wandering lost in the wilderness and coming upon this small place of refuge, with the pile of split logs, the hearth, the poker.

<div class="line_en">"Want to hear them do a real song?" I burst out. Anything to stop those memories. I'm on my feet, moving back into the trees, resting my hand on the rough trunk of a maple where the birds perch. I have not sung "The Hanging Tree" out loud for ten years, because it's forbidden, but I remember every word. I begin softly, sweetly, as my father did.</div>

<div class="line_en">Usually, I'd decline, but it's kind of impossible to say no to Pollux, given the circumstances. Besides, the mocking-jays' song voices are different from their whistles, and I'd like him to hear them. So, before I actually think about what I'm doing, I sing Rue's four notes, the ones she used to signal the end of the workday in 11. The notes that ended up as the background music to her murder. The birds don't know that. They pick up the simple phrase and bounce it back and forth between them in sweet harmony. Just as they did in the Hunger Games before the muttations broke through the trees, chased us onto the Cornucopia, and slowly gnawed Cato to a bloody pulp --</div>

<div class="line_en">The birds are waiting for me to continue. But that's it. Last verse. In the stillness I remember the scene. I was home from a day in the woods with my father. Sitting on the floor with Prim, who was just a toddler, singing "The Hanging Tree." Making us necklaces out of scraps of old rope like it said in the song, not knowing the real meaning of the words. The tune was simple and easy to harmonize to, though, and back then I could memorize almost anything set to music after a round or two. Suddenly, my mother snatched the rope necklaces away and was yelling at my father. I started to cry because my mother never yelled, and then Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide. As I had exactly one hiding spot -- in the Meadow under a honeysuckle bush -- my father found me immediately. He calmed me down and told me everything was fine, only we'd better not sing that song anymore. My mother just wanted me to forget it. So, of course, every word was immediately, irrevocably branded into my brain.</div>

<div class="line_en">We didn't sing it anymore, my father and I, or even speak of it. After he died, it used to come back to me a lot. Being older, I began to understand the lyrics. At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend to secretly meet up with him at midnight. But it's an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer's lover must have had something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That's weird obviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it's not until the third verse that "The Hanging Tree" begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He's still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she's coming to meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we'd both be free is the most troubling because at first you think he's talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it's clear that that's what he's waiting for. His lover, with her rope necklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们，爸爸和我再也没有唱起过这首歌，甚至不再提起它。爸爸死后，这首歌却时时盘桓在我脑际。长大后，我慢慢地体会了歌词的含义。刚听上去，歌词的意思似乎是说一个小伙子要和他心爱的姑娘在午夜秘密相会。但幽会的地点却很诡秘，是在一棵吊死过人的树下，被吊死的人杀了人。杀人者的恋人肯定也与这次谋杀有关，因而她必定要遭受惩罚，所以杀人者的尸首在呼唤她一起逃跑。一具尸首会说话，这故事已经很离奇了，但直到《上吊树》的第三段，故事才变得真正恐怖起来。歌者就是杀人者。他仍待在树上，虽然他叫他的爱人逃跑，可他却不停地问她是否来与他相会。那句“这是我让你逃跑的地方，这样我们俩都会获得自由”最奇怪。人们开始觉得他叫她逃跑，一定是要逃到安全的地方。之后才明白了他是让她来到他身边，一起奔向死亡。在最后一段很清楚地表明，这正是他一直等待的。他的爱人，戴着绳子做的项链，与他并肩吊死在那棵树上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy imaginable. Now, with a couple of trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, I decide not to judge him without knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To let her know he'd be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death. Didn't I want to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the Capitol? Was that really my only option? Probably not, but I couldn't think of another at the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我过去一直觉得这歌者是最恐怖的人。但在经历了几次饥饿游戏之后，我觉得不能就这样下结论。也许他的爱人已经被判死刑，他只是想让她少遭些罪，他要让她知道他在等她，也许他觉得他爱人现在的处境生不如死。我不是也曾想让皮塔喝过量的糖浆，置他于死地，使他免遭凯匹特的折磨吗？那是不是我唯一的选择？也许不是，可当时我也想不起更好的办法了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too twisted for a seven-year-old, though. Especially one who made her own rope necklaces. It wasn't like hanging was something that only happened in a story. Plenty of people were executed that way in 12. You can bet she didn't want me singing it in front of my music class. She probably wouldn't like me doing it here for Pollux even, but at least I'm not -- wait, no, I'm wrong. As I glance sideways, I see Castor has been taping me. Everyone is watching me intently. And Pollux has tears running down his cheeks because no doubt my freaky song has dredged up some terrible incident in his life. Great. I sigh and lean back against the trunk. That's when the mockingjays begin their rendition of "The Hanging Tree." In their mouths, it's quite beautiful. Conscious of being filmed, I stand quietly until I hear Cressida call, "Cut!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想妈妈当时一定觉得这歌词对于一个七岁的孩子来说也太怪异了。特别是那个为自己做了绳子项链的女孩。被吊死也不仅仅发生在故事里，十二区的许多人以这种方式被处死。她肯定不愿我在音乐课上唱出这样的歌。现在如果她在这儿，也肯定不愿意我把这歌唱给波洛斯听。可至少我没有唱给其他人听——哦，等等，不，我错了。我朝旁边瞟了一眼，我看到卡斯特正在给我录像，大家都在专注地看着我，波洛斯的泪水已经顺着脸颊流下来。显然，我唱的这首匪夷所思的歌曲已经触动了他内心深处某些可怕的回忆。太好了。我叹了口气，靠在身后的树干上。这时嘲笑鸟开始模仿起这首《上吊树》。它们用清脆的歌喉鸣唱的这首歌很美。因为意识到在录像，我一直静静地站在那里，直到克蕾西达喊了声“停”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have to be dead to forget. Maybe even not then," he tells me. "Maybe I'll be like that man in 'The Hanging Tree.' Still waiting for an answer." Gale, who I have never seen cry, has tears in his eyes. To keep them from spilling over, I reach forward and press my lips against his. We taste of heat, ashes, and misery. It's a surprising flavor for such a gentle kiss. He pulls away first and gives me a wry smile. "I knew you'd kiss me."</div>

I spend the short ride back to 13 curled up in a seat, trying to ignore Plutarch going on about one of his favorite subjects -- weapons mankind no longer has at its disposal. High-flying planes, military satellites, cell disintegrators, drones, biological weapons with expiration dates. Brought down by the destruction of the atmosphere or lack of resources or moral squeamishness. You can hear the regret of a Head Gamemaker who can only dream of such toys, who must make do with hovercraft and land-to-land missiles and plain old guns.</div>

He seems barricaded behind his podium, but the white rose in his lapel is in full view. The camera pulls back to include Peeta, off to one side in front of a projected map of Panem. He's sitting in an elevated chair, his shoes supported by a metal rung. The foot of his prosthetic leg taps out a strange irregular beat. Beads of sweat have broken through the layer of powder on his upper lip and forehead. But it's the look in his eyes -- angry yet unfocused -- that frightens me the most.</div>

He highlights the damage done to key infrastructure in various districts, and as he speaks, parts of the map light up, showing images of the destruction. A broken dam in 7. A derailed train with a pool of toxic waste spilling from the tank cars. A granary collapsing after a fire. All of these he attributes to rebel action.</div>

He tries to pick up his speech by moving on to the bombing of a water purification plant, when a clip of Finnick talking about Rue replaces him. And then the whole thing breaks down into a broadcast battle, as the Capitol tech masters try to fend off Beetee's attack. But they are unprepared, and Beetee, apparently anticipating he would not hold on to control, has an arsenal of five- to ten-second clips to work with. We watch the official presentation deteriorate as it's peppered with choice shots from the propos.</div>
