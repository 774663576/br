<div class="line_en">For a long while the only sounds were the children splashing in the pools and fountains, and once a soft plop as another orange dropped onto the terrace to burst. Then, from the far side of the palace, the captain heard the faint drumbeat of boots on marble.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The blood oranges are well past ripe," the prince observed in a weary voice, when the captain rolled him onto the terrace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Obara. He knew her stride; long-legged, hasty, angry. In the stables by the gates, her horse would be lathered, and bloody from her spurs. She always rode stallions, and had been heard to boast that she could master any horse in Dorne… and any man as well. The captain could hear other footsteps as well, the quick soft scuffing of Maester Caleotte hurrying to keep up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥芭娅来了。他熟悉她走路的方式：大步，急促，暴躁。宫门外的马厩里，她的马一定浑身是汗，而且被马刺扎得血迹斑斑。她总是骑牡马，有人听她炫耀说，她可以驯服多恩领内任何一匹马…和任何一个男人。侍卫队长也听见了其他脚步声，那是卡洛特学士拖着小碎步匆匆忙忙地在后面追赶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was true about the oranges. A few had fallen to burst open on the pale pink marble. The sharp sweet smell of them filled Hotah's nostrils each time he took a breath. No doubt the prince could smell them too, as he sat beneath the trees in the rolling chair Maester Caleotte had made for him, with its goose-down cushions and rumbling wheels of ebony and iron.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于血橙，他的评论没错。橙子不断地掉落在淡红色大理石地板上，迸裂开来。何塔每吸一口气，浓郁的甜味就充满鼻腔。亲王无疑也闻到了，他就坐在橙子树底下，卡洛特学士准备的轮椅装有乌木与钢铁制成的轮子，还配有鹅毛绒垫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she appeared beneath the triple arch, Areo Hotah swung his longaxe sideways to block the way. The head was on a shaft of mountain ash six feet long, so she could not go around. "My lady, no farther." His voice was a bass grumble thick with the accents of Norvos. "The prince does not wish to be disturbed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她出现在三重拱门之下时，阿利欧·何塔将长斧一横，挡住去路。斧头装在六尺长的山岑木柄上，她没法绕过去。“小姐，不可向前，”他的嗓门低沉浑厚，带着诺佛斯口音，“不可打扰亲王。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her face had been stone before he spoke; then it hardened. "You are in my way, Hotah." Obara was the eldest Sand Snake, a big-boned woman near to thirty, with the close-set eyes and rat-brown hair of the Oldtown whore who'd birthed her. Beneath a mottled sandsilk cloak of dun and gold, her riding clothes were old brown leather, worn and supple. They were the softest things about her. On one hip she wore a coiled whip, across her back a round shield of steel and copper. She had left her spear outside. For that, Areo Hotah gave thanks. Quick and strong as she was, the woman was no match for him, he knew… but she did not, and he had no wish to see her blood upon the pale pink marble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他开口之前，她的表情就如同坚石，现在愈加阴沉了。“你挡了我的路，何塔。”奥芭娅是最大的“沙蛇”，将近三十岁，身材高大，两眼挨得很近，鼠褐色头发跟旧镇那个生下她的妓女相同。她披着斑驳的暗金色沙蚕丝斗篷，骑马装是老旧的棕色皮衣，已经磨得柔软顺贴—那是全身上下她最软的部分。她的一侧臀部盘着一根鞭子，背后挂了一面铜铁圆盾。她将长矛留在了外面，对此，阿利欧·何塔谢天谢地。他很清楚这个敏捷强壮的女子不是自己的对手…但对方可不这么想，而他不愿让她的鲜血洒在这片淡红色大理石地板上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Obara touched her whip. "Thousands are crossing the sands afoot to climb the Boneway, so they may help Ellaria bring my father home. The septs are packed to bursting, and the red priests have lit their temple fires. In the pillow houses women are coupling with every man who comes to them, and refusing any coin. In Sunspear, on the Broken Arm, along the Greenblood, in the mountains, out in the deep sand, everywhere, everywhere, women tear their hair and men cry out in rage. The same question is heard on every tongue -- what will Doran do? What will his brother do to avenge our murdered prince?" She moved closer to the captain. "And you say, he does not wish to be disturbed!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Death had come to Dorne on raven wings, writ small and sealed with a blob of hard red wax. Caleotte must have sensed what was in that letter, for he'd given it Hotah to deliver. The prince thanked him, but for the longest time he would not break the seal. All afternoon he'd sat with the parchment in his lap, watching the children at their play. He watched until the sun went down and the evening air grew cool enough to drive them inside; then he watched the starlight on the water. It was moonrise before he sent Hotah to fetch a candle, so he might read his letter beneath the orange trees in the dark of night.</div>

<div class="line_en">The captain of guards knew the prince he guarded. Once, long ago, a callow youth had come from Norvos, a big broad-shouldered boy with a mop of dark hair. That hair was white now, and his body bore the scars of many battles… but his strength remained, and he kept his longaxe sharp, as the bearded priests had taught him. She shall not pass, he told himself, and said, "The prince is watching the children at their play. He is never to be disturbed when he is watching the children at their play."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="侍卫队长了解自己守护的亲王。很久以前，一个涉世未深的年轻人从诺佛斯来到这里，他肩宽膀粗，长着一簇浓密黑发。如今虽然头发花白，身带屡屡战伤…但他的力量依旧，而且总是保持着长柄斧的锋利，正如从前那些大胡子僧侣教导的那样。她不可以过去，他告诉自己，“亲王在看孩子们玩。他看孩子们玩的时候不可打扰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Captain," came the command, from behind. "Let her pass. I will speak with her." The prince's voice was hoarse.</div>

<div class="line_en">Areo Hotah jerked his longaxe upright and stepped to one side. Obara gave him a lingering last look and strode past, the maester hurrying at her heels. Caleotte was no more than five feet tall and bald as an egg. His face was so smooth and fat that it was hard to tell his age, but he had been here before the captain, had even served the prince's mother. Despite his age and girth, he was still nimble enough, and clever as they came, but meek. He is no match for any Sand Snake, the captain thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿利欧·何塔收起长柄斧，站到一边。奥芭娅瞪了他几眼，才大步跨过去，学士匆匆忙忙地继续跟进。卡洛特不过五尺高，脑袋秃得像个鸡蛋。他的脸平滑肥胖，以至于很难看出年龄，但他侍奉马泰尔家族的时间比侍卫队长更长，甚至服侍过亲王的母亲。尽管他已年迈发福，但仍然相当敏捷机智。不过他性格温和，无法与任何一条“沙蛇”对抗，侍卫队长心想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the shade of the orange trees, the prince sat in his chair with his gouty legs propped up before him, and heavy bags beneath his eyes… though whether it was grief or gout that kept him sleepless, Hotah could not say. Below, in the fountains and the pools, the children were still at their play. The youngest were no more than five, the oldest nine and ten. Half were girls and half were boys. Hotah could hear them splashing and shouting at each other in high, shrill voices. "It was not so long ago that you were one of the children in those pools, Obara," the prince said, when she took one knee before his rolling chair.</div>

<div class="line_en">The prince turned his chair laboriously to face her. Though he was but two-and-fifty, Doran Martell seemed much older. His body was soft and shapeless beneath his linen robes, and his legs were hard to look upon. The gout had swollen and reddened his joints grotesquely; his left knee was an apple, his right a melon, and his toes had turned to dark red grapes, so ripe it seemed as though a touch would burst them. Even the weight of a coverlet could make him shudder, though he bore the pain without complaint. Silence is a prince's friend, the captain had heard him tell his daughter once. Words are like arrows, Arianne. Once loosed, you cannot call them back. "I have written to Lord Tywin --"</div>

Three were building a sand castle with a great spike that resembled the Spear Tower of the Old Palace. A score or more had gathered in the big pool, to watch the battles as smaller children rode through the waist-deep shallows on the shoulders of the larger and tried to shove each other into the water. Every time a pair went down, the splash was followed by a roar of laughter. They watched a nut-brown girl yank a towheaded boy off his brother's shoulders to tumble him headfirst into the pool.</div>

"We had ten years between us, so I had left the pools by the time he was old enough to play, but I would watch him when I came to visit Mother. He was so fierce, even as a boy. Quick as a water snake. I oft saw him topple boys much bigger than himself. He reminded me of that the day he left for King's Landing.

He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. 'Girl or boy, we fight our battles,' he said, 'but the gods let us choose our weapons.' He pointed to the spear, then to my mother's tears, and I picked up the spear. 'I told you she was mine,' my father said, and took me. My mother drank herself to death within the year.

<div class="line_en">The captain understood. Two years ago, when they had left Sunspear for the peace and isolation of the Water Gardens, Prince Doran's gout had not been half so bad. In those days he had still walked, albeit slowly, leaning on a stick and grimacing with every step. The prince did not wish his enemies to know how feeble he had grown, and the Old Palace and its shadow city were full of eyes. Eyes, the captain thought, and steps he cannot climb. He would need to fly to sit atop the Tower of the Sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="侍卫队长明白其中含义。两年前，当他们离开阳戟城，来到安静平和、与世隔绝的水上花园时，道朗亲王的痛风病还不及现在一半严重。那些日子，他仍然可以走动，尽管很慢，还得倚靠拐杖，每走一步都伴随着痛苦。亲王不希望敌人知道自己变得有多么羸弱，而旧宫及其影子城里布满了眼线。布满眼线，也布满他无法攀上的阶梯，侍卫队长心想，他得长出翅膀才能登上太阳塔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The white knight. The captain frowned. Ser Arys had come to Dorne to attend his own princess, as Areo Hotah had once come with his. Even their names sounded oddly alike: Areo and Arys. Yet there the likeness ended. The captain had left Norvos and its bearded priests, but Ser Arys Oakheart still served the Iron Throne. Hotah had felt a certain sadness whenever he saw the man in the long snowy cloak, the times the prince had sent him down to Sunspear. One day, he sensed, the two of them would fight; on that day Oakheart would die, with the captain's longaxe crashing through his skull. He slid his hand along the smooth ashen shaft of his axe and wondered if that day was drawing nigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白骑士。侍卫队长皱起眉头。亚历斯爵士护卫他的公主来到多恩，就跟阿利欧·何塔当年护送亲王的夫人一样。真奇怪，连他们的名字也有点像：阿利欧与亚历斯。然而相似之处仅止于此，侍卫队长彻底离开了诺佛斯及那里的大胡子僧侣们，亚历斯·奥克赫特爵士却仍为铁王座效力。亲王曾有几次派何塔去阳戟城办事，每当他看到那个身披雪白披风的人，都会感到莫名的悲哀。他感觉到，总有一天，他们两个将做殊死拼斗；到时候，奥克赫特会一命呜呼，被侍卫队长的长柄斧击碎头颅。想到这里，他的手不禁沿着斧子的岑木柄上下摸索，思量这一天到底是远是近。">查看中文翻译</div>

When the raven arrived with word that my mother had been brought to bed a month too soon, I was old enough to understand that meant the child would not live. Even when Lord Gargalen told me that I had a sister, I assured him that she must shortly die. Yet she lived, by the Mother's mercy. And a year later Oberyn arrived, squalling and kicking. I was a man grown when they were playing in these pools. Yet here I sit, and they are gone."</div>

<div class="line_en">He was still groping for some words to say when another orange fell with a heavy splat, no more than a foot from where the prince was seated. Doran winced at the sound, as if somehow it had hurt him. "Enough," he sighed, "it is enough. Leave me, Areo. Let me watch the children for a few more hours."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当他琢磨着该怎么说时，又一只橙子“啪”的一声砸落下来，落地的地方离亲王不到一尺。道朗听到声音怔了怔，仿佛被砸疼了似的。“够了，”他长叹一声，“够了。让我一个人待着，阿利欧，让我再多看孩子们玩几个钟头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Areo Hotah did not know what to say to that. He was only a captain of guards, and still a stranger to this land and its seven-faced god, even after all these years. Serve. Obey.

<div class="line_en">When the sun set the air grew cool and the children went inside in search of supper, still the prince remained beneath his orange trees, looking out over the still pools and the sea beyond. A serving man brought him a bowl of purple olives, with flatbread, cheese, and chickpea paste. He ate a bit of it, and drank a cup of the sweet, heavy strongwine that he loved. When it was empty, he filled it once again. Sometimes in the deep black hours of the morning sleep found him in his chair. Only then did the captain roll him down the moonlit gallery, past a row of fluted pillars and through a graceful archway, to a great bed with crisp cool linen sheets in a chamber by the sea. Doran groaned as the captain moved him, but the gods were good and he did not wake.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he honed the axe, Hotah thought of Norvos, the high city on the hill and the low beside the river. He could still recall the sounds of the three bells, the way that Noom's deep peals set his very bones to shuddering, the proud strong voice of Narrah, sweet Nyel's silvery laughter. The taste of wintercake filled his mouth again, rich with ginger and pine nuts and bits of cherry, with nahsa to wash it down, fermented goat's milk served in an iron cup and laced with honey. He saw his mother in her dress with the squirrel collar, the one she wore but once each year, when they went to see the bears dance down the Sinner's Steps. And he smelled the stench of burning hair as the bearded priest touched the brand to the center of his chest. The pain had been so fierce that he thought his heart might stop, yet Areo Hotah had not flinched. The hair had never grown back over the axe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only when both edges were sharp enough to shave with did the captain lay his ash-andiron wife down on the bed. Yawning, he pulled off his soiled clothes, tossed them on the floor, and stretched out on his straw-stuffed mattress. Thinking of the brand had made it itch, so he had to scratch himself before he closed his eyes. I should have gathered up the oranges that fell, he thought, and went to sleep dreaming of the tart sweet taste of them, and the sticky feel of the red juice on his fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等两边斧刃都锋利到可以用来刮胡子，侍卫队长才将他岑木和钢铁做的爱妻放倒在床上。他一边打哈欠，一边脱下脏外衣，随意扔到地板上，然后在稻草为底的床上伸展身子。想到烙印，感觉有点痒，因此他在阖眼前不得不挠了挠。我该把那些掉落的橙子收集起来，他心想，睡觉时能梦见它们酸酸甜甜的味道，还有指头黏糊糊的红色汁液。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although the prince had spoken of departing at first light, Areo Hotah knew that he would dawdle. Whilst the maester helped Doran Martell to bathe and bandaged up his swollen joints in linen wraps soaked with soothing lotions, the captain donned a shirt of copper scales as befit his rank, and a billowing cloak of dun-and-yellow sandsilk to keep the sun off the copper. The day promised to be hot, and the captain had long ago discarded the heavy horsehair cape and studded leather tunic he had worn in Norvos, which were like to cook a man in Dorne. He had kept his iron halfhelm, with its crest of sharpened spikes, but now he wore it wrapped in orange silk, weaving the cloth in and around the spikes. Elsewise the sun beating down on the metal would have his head pounding before they saw the palace.</div>

Five spearmen walked ahead and five behind, with five more flanking the litter to either side. Areo Hotah himself took his familiar place at the left hand of the prince, resting his longaxe on a shoulder as he walked.

Nymeria Sand was five-and-twenty, and slender as a willow. Her straight black hair, worn in a long braid bound up with red-gold wire, made a widow's peak above her dark eyes, just as her father's had. With her high cheekbones, full lips, and milk-pale skin, she had all the beauty that her elder sister lacked… but Obara's mother had been an Oldtown whore, whilst Nym was born from the noblest blood of old Volantis.

First the slender Spear Tower, a hundred-and-a-half feet tall and crowned with a spear of gilded steel that added another thirty feet to its height; then the mighty Tower of the Sun, with its dome of gold and leaded glass; last the dun-colored Sandship, looking like some monstrous dromond that had washed ashore and turned to stone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only three leagues of coast road divided Sunspear from the Water Gardens, yet they were two different worlds. There children frolicked naked in the sun, music played in tiled courtyards, and the air was sharp with the smell of lemons and blood oranges. Here the air smelled of dust, sweat, and smoke, and the nights were alive with the babble of voices. In place of the pink marble of the Water Gardens, Sunspear was built from mud and straw, and colored brown and dun. The ancient stronghold of House Martell stood at the easternmost end of a little jut of stone and sand, surrounded on three sides by the sea. To the west, in the shadows of Sunspear's massive walls, mud-brick shops and windowless hovels clung to the castle like barnacles to a galley's hull. Stables and inns and winesinks and pillow houses had grown up west of those, many enclosed by walls of their own, and yet more hovels had risen beneath those walls. And so and so and so, as the bearded priests would say. Compared to Tyrosh or Myr or Great Norvos, the shadow city was no more than a town, yet it was the nearest thing to a true city that these Dornish had.</div>

One ragged boy darted past the spearmen with a half-rotten pomegranate in one hand, but when he saw Areo Hotah in his path, with longaxe at the ready, he let the fruit fall unthrown and beat a quick retreat.
