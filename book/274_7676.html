<div class="line_en">The man of Song only heard him talk profusely about stealing and robbing, but did not find out clearly how to steal and rob. The minute he returned home, he got dizzy with imagined success and started to steal and rob.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as it was dark, he climbed over the wall of the family on the east, and dug a hole in the wall of the family on the west. He stole whatever he saw. After some time, his family actually began getting rich. But just when he was immensely proud of himself, the bailiffs from the yamen (government office) came and arrested him. He was declared guilty and put in prison. All the things he had stolen and robbed, together with his own old and worn-out stuff, were confiscated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天一黑，他就翻东家的墙，挖西家的洞。看到什么偷什么。时间一长，家里居然也富起来了。可是，正当他洋洋自得的时候，衙门差人到他家里，将他捉拿归案，判了罪，坐了牢。他偷来抢来的一切，连同他原有的破旧东西，全部被没收了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was also very poor before, but now I am quite well-off. The only reason is that I can steal and rob. But it is very painstaking. By stealing and robbing, I could make a living in the first year, and in the second year I had more than enough to eat and wear. In the third year, my family's storehouse was truly filled with grain and millet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我原来也很贫穷，可是现在日子过得很好。原因只是我会偷、会抢罢了。不过太辛苦了。我偷呀抢呀，第一年生活就够维持了，第二年就已经吃不完穿不完了，第三年我家里真是粮满囤、谷满仓。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He continued:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"By stealing and robbing, I meant seeking for the resources of the earth, and racing against the seasons of the heavens. Dense forests, broad land, sunshine, rain and dew, wind and cloud, all these are my targets for robbing. I approach them, make friends with them, and rely on them to plant crops and build houses. Birds in the sky, beasts on land, fish and shrimp in the river…all these don't belong to me by nature. But I, fearing neither hardship nor toil, use my brains and think up ways to steal them and rob them. This is stealing and robbing in an open and aboveboard way. It is by no means committing a crime. As to the clothing, food and articles of individuals, they are obtained through people's own labour, and can only belong to these people. I have never encouraged you to steal and rob other people's private property. But you have actually done so, which does break the law. Who is to blame for your being found guilty and put in prison?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说的偷、抢是向土地要资源，与老天抢时间。茂密的山林、广阔的土地、阳光、雨露、风云等都是我抢夺的对象。我接近它们，同它们交朋友，依靠它们，种庄稼、建房屋。空中的飞禽，陆上的走兽，河里的鱼虾··…这些东西原来都不属于我，但是我动脑筋，想办法，不怕苦，不怕累，把它们偷了过来，抢了过来，这是光明正大的偷、抢，并不是犯罪呀！至于那些属于私人的衣物、食品都是人们用自己的劳动取得的，只能属于他们自己。我从来没有叫你去偷、去抢人家的东西呀！可是你竟然去偷、去抢别人家的东西，这是犯法的行为。你被判罪坐牢，这到底应该怪谁呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
