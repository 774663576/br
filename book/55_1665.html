<div class="line_en">Like the works of Homer, the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) was set in the late 2nd millennium BCE but written more than five hundred years later. But unlike the works of Homer, the Bible is revered today by billions of people who call it the source of their moral values. The world's bestselling publication, the Good Book has been translated into three thousand languages and has been placed in the nightstands of hotels all over the world. Orthodox Jews kiss it with their prayer shawls; witnesses in American courts bind their oaths by placing a hand on it. Even the president touches it when taking the oath of office. Yet for all this reverence, the Bible is one long celebration of violence.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God took one of Adam's ribs, and made he a woman. And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain. And she again bare his brother Abel. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. With a world population of exactly four, that works out to a homicide rate of 25 percent, which is about a thousand times higher than the equivalent rates in Western countries today.</div>

<div class="line_en">Abraham undergoes a test of his moral values when God orders him to take his son Isaac to a mountaintop, tie him up, cut his throat, and burn his body as a gift to the Lord. Isaac is spared only because at the last moment an angel stays his father's hand. For millennia readers have puzzled over why God insisted on this horrifying trial. One interpretation is that God intervened not because Abraham had passed the test but because he had failed it, but that is anachronistic: obedience to divine authority, not reverence for human life, was the cardinal virtue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神为了考验亚伯拉罕的道德观，命令他将儿子以撒带到山顶，捆绑起来，再割开喉咙，作为给神的燔祭。以撒能够生还，是因为天使拉住了亚伯拉罕的手。1000多年来，读者们始终在困惑，神为什么进行这样可怕的试探。一种解释是，神之所以阻止他，不是因为亚伯拉罕经受了考验，而是因为他做错了。但这样的解释不符合当时的标准：服从神的权威，而不是敬畏人的生命，才是至高的美德。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Isaac's son Jacob has a daughter, Dinah. Dinah is kidnapped and raped -- apparently a customary form of courtship at the time, since the rapist's family then offers to purchase her from her own family as a wife for the rapist. Dinah's brothers explain that an important moral principle stands in the way of this transaction: the rapist is uncircumcised. So they make a counteroffer: if all the men in the rapist's hometown cut off their foreskins, Dinah will be theirs. While the men are incapacitated with bleeding penises, the brothers invade the city, plunder and destroy it, massacre the men, and carry off the women and children. When Jacob worries that neighboring tribes may attack them in revenge, his sons explain that it was worth the risk: "Should our sister be treated like a whore?" Soon afterward they reiterate their commitment to family values by selling their brother Joseph into slavery.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob's descendants, the Israelites, find their way to Egypt and become too numerous for the Pharaoh's liking, so he enslaves them and orders that all the boys be killed at birth. Moses escapes the mass infanticide and grows up to challenge the Pharaoh to let his people go. God, who is omnipotent, could have softened Pharaoh's heart, but he hardens it instead, which gives him a reason to afflict every Egyptian with painful boils and other miseries before killing every one of their firstborn sons. (The word Passover alludes to the executioner angel's passing over the households with Israelite firstborns.) God follows this massacre with another one when he drowns the Egyptian army as they pursue the Israelites across the Red Sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Israelites assemble at Mount Sinai and hear the Ten Commandments, the great moral code that outlaws engraved images and the coveting of livestock but gives a pass to slavery, rape, torture, mutilation, and genocide of neighboring tribes. The Israelites become impatient while waiting for Moses to return with an expanded set of laws, which will prescribe the death penalty for blasphemy, homosexuality, adultery, talking back to parents, and working on the Sabbath. To pass the time, they worship a statue of a calf, for which the punishment turns out to be, you guessed it, death. Following orders from God, Moses and his brother Aaron kill three thousand of their companions.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the Israelites proceed toward the promised land, they meet up with the Midianites. Following orders from God, they slay the males, burn their city, plunder the livestock, and take the women and children captive. When they return to Moses, he is enraged because they spared the women, some of whom had led the Israelites to worship rival gods. So he tells his soldiers to complete the genocide and to reward themselves with nubile sex slaves they may rape at their pleasure: "Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves."</div>

Centuries earlier, during the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, the Amalekites had harassed them, and God commanded the Israelites to "wipe out the name of Amalek." So when the judge Samuel anoints Saul as king, he reminds Saul of the divine decree: "Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass." Saul carries out the order, but Samuel is furious to learn that he has spared their king, Agag. So Samuel "hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Bible depicts a world that, seen through modern eyes, is staggering in its savagery. People enslave, rape, and murder members of their immediate families. Warlords slaughter civilians indiscriminately, including the children. Women are bought, sold, and plundered like sex toys. And Yahweh tortures and massacres people by the hundreds of thousands for trivial disobedience or for no reason at all. These atrocities are neither isolated nor obscure. They implicate all the major characters of the Old Testament, the ones that Sunday-school children draw with crayons. And they fall into a continuous plotline that stretches for millennia, from Adam and Eve through Noah, the patriarchs, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Saul, David, Solomon, and beyond. According to the biblical scholar Raymund Schwager, the Hebrew Bible "contains over six hundred passages that explicitly talk about nations, kings, or individuals attacking, destroying, and killing others… Aside from the approximately one thousand verses in which Yahweh himself appears as the direct executioner of violent punishments, and the many texts in which the Lord delivers the criminal to the punisher's sword, in over one hundred other passages Yahweh expressly gives the command to kill people." Matthew White, a self-described atrocitologist who keeps a database with the estimated death tolls of history's major wars, massacres, and genocides, counts about 1.2 million deaths from mass killing that are specifically enumerated in the Bible. (He excludes the half million casualties in the war between Judah and Israel described in 2 Chronicles 13 because he considers the body count historically implausible.) The victims of the Noachian flood would add another 20 million or so to the total.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在现代人眼中，《圣经》所描绘的世界，其野蛮撼人心魄。家庭直系亲属之间相互奴役、奸污和谋杀。军人毫无区别地屠杀平民，包括儿童。妇女被买卖，像性玩具那样被争来抢去。仅仅为了些鸡零狗碎的不听话，甚至不为任何原因，耶和华虐待和屠杀的人就有成千上万。这些暴行既不是孤立的个案，也不曾躲躲闪闪，所有那些在主日学校被孩子们用蜡笔涂色的、《圣经·旧约》中头面人物的故事里都能见到这些暴行。它们好像一条不断展开的情节线，绵延千年，从亚当、夏娃开始至诺亚，到三圣父（亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各），到摩西、约书亚、士师们、扫罗、大卫、所罗门和后来的各位。据《圣经》学者雷蒙德·施瓦格尔（Raymund Schwager）说，“希伯来《圣经》中有600个段落专门是来谈论族群之间、国王之间或个人之间的攻击、毁灭和相互残杀……除了约有1000个句子提到耶和华现身亲手执行暴力惩罚，有更多的经文描写耶和华将犯罪者送到行刑人的刀口下，还有100多处提到耶和华亲口下令杀人”。马修·怀特（Matthew White），一位自封的暴力学家，建立了一个数据库估算人类历史上主要战争、屠杀和种族清洗造成的死亡人数，他认为《圣经》中有特别记载的大规模杀戮约为120万人。（他剔除了《历代志下》第13节中描述的犹大人和以色列人之战的50万人死亡，因为他认为历史上的尸体清点总是令人难以信服。）如果加上诺亚洪水的受害者，被害人数约为2000万人上下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The distancing effect of a good story can make us forget the brutality of the world in which it was set. Just imagine a judge in family court today adjudicating a maternity dispute by pulling out a chain saw and threatening to butcher the baby before the disputants' eyes. Solomon was confident that the more humane woman (we are never told that she was the mother) would reveal herself, and that the other woman was so spiteful that she would allow a baby to be slaughtered in front of her -- and he was right! And he must have been prepared, in the event he was wrong, to carry out the butchery or else forfeit all credibility. The women, for their part, must have believed that their wise king was capable of carrying out this grisly murder.</div>

<div class="line_en">The good news, of course, is that most of it never happened. Not only is there no evidence that Yahweh inundated the planet and incinerated its cities, but the patriarchs, exodus, conquest, and Jewish empire are almost certainly fictions. Historians have found no mention in Egyptian writings of the departure of a million slaves (which could hardly have escaped the Egyptians' notice); nor have archaeologists found evidence in the ruins of Jericho or neighboring cities of a sacking around 1200 BCE. And if there was a Davidic empire stretching from the Euphrates to the Red Sea around the turn of the 1st millennium BCE, no one else at the time seemed to have noticed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，令人欣慰的是，这些事件大部分是从未发生过的。不仅是没有证据显示耶和华水漫大地、火焚城市，就连三圣父、出埃及记和征伐建立犹太王国，也几乎肯定都是虚构的。在埃及的文字记载里，历史学家找不到任何有关百万奴隶离去的只言片语（而这样的事件不可能逃过埃及人的眼睛）。在耶利哥城及其附近城市的废墟上，考古学家也没有发现任何在公元前1200年毁于战祸的痕迹。公元前1000年前后，如果真有一个从幼发拉底河延伸到红海的大卫王国，当时竟然完全没有人留意到它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The oldest parts of the Hebrew Bible probably originated in the 10th century BCE. They included origin myths for the local tribes and ruins, and legal codes adapted from neighboring civilizations in the Near East. The texts probably served as a code of frontier justice for the Iron Age tribes that herded livestock and farmed hillsides in the southeastern periphery of Canaan. The tribes began to encroach on the valleys and cities, engaged in some marauding every now and again, and may even have destroyed a city or two. Eventually their myths were adopted by the entire population of Canaan, unifying them with a shared genealogy, a glorious history, a set of taboos to keep them from defecting to foreigners, and an invisible enforcer to keep them from each other's throats. A first draft was rounded out with a continuous historical narrative around the late 7th to mid-6th century BCE, when the Babylonians conquered the Kingdom of Judah and forced its inhabitants into exile. The final edit was completed after their return to Judah in the 5th century BCE.</div>

<div class="line_en">If you think that by reviewing the literal content of the Hebrew Bible I am trying to impugn the billions of people who revere it today, then you are missing the point. The overwhelming majority of observant Jews and Christians are, needless to say, thoroughly decent people who do not sanction genocide, rape, slavery, or stoning people for frivolous infractions. Their reverence for the Bible is purely talismanic. In recent millennia and centuries the Bible has been spin-doctored, allegorized, superseded by less violent texts (the Talmud among Jews and the New Testament among Christians), or discreetly ignored. And that is the point. Sensibilities toward violence have changed so much that religious people today compartmentalize their attitude to the Bible. They pay it lip service as a symbol of morality, while getting their actual morality from more modern principles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你认为，我回述希伯来《圣经》的文字内容，是试图非难今天数十亿信众，那你根本就没有明白我在说什么。毋庸置疑，犹太教徒和基督徒中的绝大部分人都是绝对正派的人，他们不会赞成种族清洗、强奸、奴隶制，以及为了轻薄风流就将人用乱石砸死。他们纯粹是将《圣经》作为神迹而敬畏的。过去的一千几百年间，《圣经》一直在不断地被修改，被寓言化，或被谨慎地忽略，暴力内容较少的经文（犹太教的《犹太法典》和基督徒的《圣经·新约》）的地位越来越重要。而这一点正是问题的关键。人们对暴力的感受已经发生了巨变，今天的信徒对《圣经》是有取舍的。他们只是口头上承认《圣经》是道德典范，而实际的道德观念却来自现代原则。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though the historical accounts in the Old Testament are fictitious (or at best artistic reconstructions, like Shakespeare's historical dramas), they offer a window into the lives and values of Near Eastern civilizations in the mid-1st millennium BCE. Whether or not the Israelites actually engaged in genocide, they certainly thought it was a good idea. The possibility that a woman had a legitimate interest in not being raped or acquired as sexual property did not seem to register in anyone's mind. The writers of the Bible saw nothing wrong with slavery or with cruel punishments like blinding, stoning, and hacking someone to pieces. Human life held no value in comparison with unthinking obedience to custom and authority.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然《圣经·旧约》中的历史事件是虚构的（或者说是像莎士比亚的历史悲剧一样，经过了巧妙的艺术加工的），它仍然为我们观察公元前5世纪近东文明的生活和价值观提供了一扇窗户。不论以色列人是否卷入过种族清洗，他们显然认为这是个好主意。任何人都不曾想过，不被强暴，不被当作一件性具，可能是一位妇女的正当权益。在《圣经》作者的眼中，奴隶制，还有像剜眼、石刑、分尸这些酷刑都无可非议。与对习俗和权威不假思索的服从相比，人的生命毫无价值。">查看中文翻译</div>
