<div class="line_en">The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，住嘴，德思礼，你这个大傻瓜。”巨人说。他隔着沙发把枪从德思礼手里抢过来，轻轻一撅，绾了一个结就把它扔到屋角里了，仿佛这支枪是用橡皮做的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巨人又坐到沙发上，沉重的身躯把沙发压得直往下塌。他开始从外衣口袋里掏出各式各样的东西：一把铜壶、一包压扁的香肠、一只拨火钳、一把茶壶、几只缺口的大杯子和一瓶琥珀色的液体。他先喝了一大口，然后开始泡茶。小屋里随即充满了烤香肠的香味和咝咝的声音。在巨人忙活的时候，谁也没有吱声。但是当他把第一批烤好的六根粗粗的、油汪汪的、烤得稍稍有点焦的香肠从拨火钳上拿下来时，达力有些坐不住了。弗农姨父厉声说：“达力，不准碰他给你的任何东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, "I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把香肠递给哈利。哈利早就饿极了，他这辈子也没吃过这么好吃的东西，但他始终无法将目光从巨人身上移开。最后，他看不会有人出来作任何解释，于是问：“对不起，可我真的还是不知道您是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>
