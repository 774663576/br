<div class="line_en">I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the journey I undertook for that purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.</div>

<div class="line_en">That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我回顾我一生中幸运的时候，我有时候不禁这样说：如果有人提议我重新做人的话，我倒乐意把我的一生再从头重演一遍，我仅仅要求像作家那样，在再版时有改正初版某些缺陷的机会。如若可能，除了改正错误以外，我也同样地要把某些不幸的遭遇变得更顺利些。但是即使无法避免这些不幸的厄运，我还是愿意接受原议，重演生平。但是由于这种重演是不可能的，那么最接近重演的似乎就是回忆了。为了使回忆尽可能地保持久远，似乎就需要把它记下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words, "Without vanity I may say," &amp;c., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此我将顺从一种老人中常有的癖好来谈论自己和自己过去的作为。但是我这样做，将不使听者感到厌倦，他们或是因为敬老，觉得非听我的话不可，但是一经写下来，听与不听就可以悉听自便了。最后（我还是自己承认了好，因为即使我否认，别人也不会相信），写自传，或许还会大大地满足我的自负心。说句老实话，我时常听见或在书上读到别人在刚说完了像“我可以毫不自夸地说…”这种开场白以后，接着就是一大篇自吹自擂的话。大多数人不喜欢别人的虚夸，不管他们自己是多么自负。但是无论在什么地方，我对这种自负心总是宽宥的。因为我相信这种心理对自己和他四周的人都有好处。所以，在许多情况下，一个人如果把自负心当作生命的慰藉而感谢上帝，这也不能算是怪诞悖理的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His kind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them success. My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not presume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as others have done: the complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自传既然我提到了上帝，我愿意十分谦恭地承认，上面提到的我过去一生中的幸福当归功于上帝仁慈的旨意，上帝使我找到了处世之道，并且使这些方法获得成功。这种信仰使我希望，虽然我不应该臆断，上帝在将来会像以前一样地祝福我，不论是使我继续享受幸福，或是使我忍受命中注定的逆运（像其他人一样，我也可能有这样的遭遇），因为我未来命运的轮廓只有上帝知道，上帝甚至能够通过苦难来祝福我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them, at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will among them find many more particulars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有一位伯父，他也同样地爱好搜集家族中的遗闻轶事，有一次他交给我一些笔记，其中讲到关于我们祖先的一些事情。从这些笔记我知道我们的家族在诺桑普顿郡的爱克顿教区至少已经住了三百年，究竟在这以前还有多少年，他就不知道了。（也许从他们采用“富兰克林”为姓的那时候起。“富兰克林”在这以前是一个人民阶层此处原文是anorderofpeople。按franklin一词原指英国十四、五世纪的非贵族的小土地所有者或自由农。——译者的名称，当时英国各地人们都在采用姓氏。）他们享有三十英亩的自由领地，以打铁为副业。直到我伯父的时候为止，打铁这一行业一直保持在我们家族中。家中的长子总是学打铁的，我伯父和我父亲都按照这个传统叫他们的长子学铁匠。我查考了爱克顿教区的户籍册，我只找到了一五五五年以后的出生、嫁娶和丧葬的纪录，那时以前的户籍册在那个教区里已经没有了，从这个户籍册里我发现我是五世以来小儿子的小儿子。我祖父汤麦斯生于一五九八年，住在爱克顿直到他年迈不能从事生产的时候为止，然后他住到他儿子约翰的地方去，他儿子是牛津郡班布雷村的一个染匠，我父亲就是跟着他学徒的。我的祖父就死在那里，葬在那里。我们在一七五八年看到了他的墓碑。他的长子汤麦斯住在爱克顿的住宅里，后来把住宅和田产遗留给他的独养女儿。他女儿和她的丈夫（是威灵堡的一个叫做费雪的人）又把房产卖给伊斯德先生，他现在就是那里的庄园领主。我祖父养大了四个儿子，名叫汤麦斯、约翰、本杰明和约瑟。我手边没有材料，但是我将把我记得的给你写出来。如果我的纪录在我离家以后未曾遗失的话，你可以从纪录里找到更详细的材料。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He left behind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen. He had formed a short-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in his short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell lately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets, relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them here, when he went to America, which was about fifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.</div>

<div class="line_en">This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before.</div>
