<div class="line_en">My youngest brother paid no attention to me. Grasping more firmly his newspaper-wrapped notebook and his tin can lunch of cornbread and oil sausages, he continued to concentrate on the dusty road. He lagged several feet behind my other brothers, Stacey and Christopher-John, and me, attempting to keep the rusty Mississippi dust from swelling with each step and drifting back upon his shiny black shoes and the cuffs of his corduroy pants by lifting each foot high before setting it gently down again. Always meticulously neat, six-year old Little Man never allowed dirt or tears or stains to mar anything he owned. Today was no exception.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的小弟弟并没有理睬我，兀自抓紧自己用报纸包好的本子和装着玉米面包以及油香肠的饭盒，小心翼翼地走在尘土飞扬的道路上。他落在我的兄弟斯泰西、克里斯托弗·约翰和我的后头。每走一步，他都高高抬起脚，轻轻落下来，以免尘土沾上自己锃亮的黑皮鞋和灯芯绒裤子的翻边。这个六岁的小家伙永远这么爱干净，决不允许任何尘土污渍弄脏他的任何东西，今天也不例外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You keep it up and make us late for school, Mama's gonna wear you out." I threatened, pulling with exasperation at the high collar of the Sunday dress Mama had made me wear for the first day of school -- as if that event were something special. it seemed to me that showing up at school at all on a bright August-like October morning made for running the cool forest trails and wading barefoot in the forest pond was concession enough; Sunday clothing was asking too much. Christopher-John and Stacey were not too pleased about the clothing or school either. Only Little Man, just beginning his school career, found the prospects of both intriguing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你最好走快点，要是我们迟到了，妈妈绝不会饶过你的。”我恼怒地竖起衣领，威胁这小家伙。妈妈让我穿上最好的衣服，因为今天是开学的第一天——好像这是个多么特别的日子似的。对我来说，在10月的清晨，穿着这身衣服穿过阴凉的森林小径，赤脚蹚过池塘，实在是个麻烦。克里斯托弗和斯泰西也或多或少对衣服、对上学有些不满。不过第一天上学的小家伙，倒是兴致勃勃，充满好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Christopher-John, walking between Stacey and me, glanced uneasily at both of us but did not interfere. A short, round boy of seven, he took little interest in troublesome things, preferring to remain on good terms with everyone, Yet he was always sensitive to others and now, shifting the handle of his lunch can from his right hand to his right wrist and his smudged notebook from his left hand to his left armpit. he stuffed his free hands into his pockets and attempted to make his face as moody as Stacey's and as cranky as mine. But after a few moments he seemed to forget that he was supposed to be grouchy and began whistling cheerfully. There was little that could make Christopher-John unhappy for very long, not even the thought of school.</div>

A barbed-wire fence ran the length of the deep field, stretching eastward for over a quarter of a mile until it met the sloping green pasture that signaled the end of our family's four hundred acres, An ancient oak tree on the slope, visible even now, was the official dividing mark between Logan land and the beginning of a dense forest. Beyond the protective fencing of the forest, vast farming fields, worked by a multitude of share- cropping families, covered two-thirds of a ten-square-mile plantation.

<div class="line_en">Once our land had been Granger land too, but the Grangers had sold it during Reconstruction to a Yankee for tax money. In 1887, when the land was up for sell again, Grandpa had bought two hundred acres of it, and in 19I8, after the first two hundred acres had been paid off, he had bought another two hundred, It was good rich land, much of it still virgin forest, and there was no debt on half of it. But there was a mortgage on the two hundred acres bought in 1918 and there were taxes on the full four hundred, and for the past three years there had not been enough money from the cotton to pay both and live on too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们家族的土地本来也是属于格兰杰家族的，不过当时格兰杰为了缴纳重建时期的税，把部分土地卖给了我们。1877年，格兰杰家族再次出售土地，爷爷买了两百英亩土地。1918年，在偿清了那两百英亩土地的贷款后，爷爷又买了两百英亩土地。这些土地土壤丰沃，大部分是未开发的森林。不过一想到1918年那两百英亩土地的贷款以及四百英亩土地的土地税，真是让人头大。过去三年里，我们种植棉花赚的钱，还不够偿还贷款与添补家用。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was there he found work laying track for the railroad. He worked the remainder of the year away from us, not returning until the deep winter when the ground was cold and barren. The following spring after the planting was finished. he did the same. Now it was 1933 and Papa was again in Louisiana laying track.</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked at Papa strangely when he said that, for I knew that all the land did not belong to me. Some of it belonged to Stacey, Christopher-John, and Little Man, not to mention the part that belonged to Big Ma. Mama, and Uncle Hammer, Papa's older brother who lived in Chicago. But Papa never divided the land in his mind: it was simply Logan land. For it he would work the long, hot summer pounding steel: Mama would teach and run the farm; Big Ma, in her sixties, would work like a woman of twenty in the fields and keep the house; and the boys and I would wear threadbare clothing washed to dishwater color: but always, the taxes and the mortgage would be paid. Papa said that one day I would understand. I wondered.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the fields ended and the Granger forest fanned both sides of the road with long overhanging branches, a tall, emaciated-looking boy popped suddenly from a forest trail and swung a thin arm around Stacey. It was T. J. Avery. His younger brother Claude emerged a moment later, smiling weakly as if it pained him to do so. Neither boy had on shoes, and their Sunday clothing, patched and worn, hung loosely upon their frail frames. The Avery family share- cropped on Granger land.</div>

They were headed for the Jefferson Davis County School. a long white wooden building looming in the distance. Behind the building was a wide sports field around which were scattered rows of tiered gray-looking benches. In front of it were two yellow buses, our own tormentor and one that brought students from the other direction, and loitering students awaiting the knell of the morning bell. In the very center of the expansive front lawn, waving red, white and blue with the emblem of the Confederacy emblazoned in its upper left-hand corner. was the Mississippi nag.

Consisting of four weather-beaten wooden houses on stilts of brick. 320 students, seven teachers. a principal. a caretaker, and the caretaker's cow, which kept the wide crabgrass lawn sufficiently clipped in spring and summer, the school was located near three plantations, the largest and closest by far being the Granger plantation.

<div class="line_en">Because the students were needed in the fields from early spring when the cotton was planted until after most of the cotton had been picked in the fall, the school adjusted its terms accordingly, beginning in October and dismissing in March. But even so, after today a number of the older students would not be seen again for a month or two, not until the last puff of cotton had been gleaned from the fields, and eventually most would drop out of school altogether. Because of this the classes in the higher grades grew Smaller with each passing year.</div>

Girls stood awkwardly, afraid to sit, and boys pulled restlessly at starched, high-buttoned collars. Those students fortunate enough to have shoes hopped from one pinched foot to the other.

She beamed down upon them as if she expected to be applauded for this bit of news, then with a swoop of her large eyes to include the fourth graders, she went on. "Now since there's only one of me, we shall have to sacrifice for the next few days. We shall work, work, work. but we shall have to work like little Christian boys and girls and share, share, share. Now are we willing to do that!"</div>

I knew that he could not see the soiled covers or the marred pages from where he sat, and even though his penchant for cleanliness was often annoying, I did not like to think of his disappointment when he saw the books as they really were. But there was nothing that I could do about it, so I opened my book to its center and began browsing through the spotted pages. Girls with blond braids and boys with blue eyes stared up at me. I found a story about a boy and his dog lost in a cave and began reading while Miss Crocker's voice droned on monotonously.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mama smiled up at Miss Crocker and said rather absently, "Yes, of course, Daisy. Thank you." Then she opened her desk drawer and pulled out some paper, a pair of scissors. and a small brown bottle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Crocker, dismayed by Mama's seeming unconcern for the seriousness of the matter, thrust her shoulders back and began moving away from the desk. "You understand that if they don't have those books to study from, I'll have to fail them in both reading and composition, since i plan to base all my lessons around --" She stopped abruptly and stared in amazement at Mama. "Mary, what in the world are you doing!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克洛克小姐看到妈妈并没有意识到事情有多严重似的，挺了挺肩膀，慢慢离开了桌子。“你应该知道，要是他们没有这些书的话，他们就没法学习了。我会给他们的阅读和写作不及格的，因为这学期我打算以这本书为基础——”她突然停下来，惊讶地看着妈妈，“玛丽，你在干什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mama did not answer. She had trimmed the paper to the size of the books and was now dipping a gray-looking glue from the brown bottle onto the inside cover of one of the books. Then she took the paper and placed it over the glue.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mama laughed and picked up the other book. "In the first place no one cares enough to come down here, and in the second place if anyone should come, maybe he could see all the things we need -- current books for all of our subjects, not just somebody's old throwaways, desks, paper, black- boards, erasers, maps, chalk…" Her voice trailed off as she glued the second book.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although Mama had been a teacher at Great Faith for fourteen years, ever since she had graduated from the Crandon Teacher Training School at nineteen, she was still considered by many of the other teachers as a disrupting maverick. Her ideas were always a bit too radical and her statements a bit too pointed. The fact that she had not grown up in Spokane County but in the Delta made her even more suspect, and the more traditional. thinkers like Miss Crocker were wary of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈十九岁从克兰登教师培训学校毕业后，就进入了大信仰中小学，现在已经有十四个年头了。但很多老师还是把她当成离经叛道的人。她的想法有些激进，说的话有些犀利。因为妈妈不是出生在斯波坎县，而是在三角洲地区，所以性格上更为激进。很多传统的老师，像克洛克小姐，都有些怵她。">查看中文翻译</div>
