<div class="line_en">Dylan opened her eyes and was instantly blinded. Brilliant white light pierced her brain. She tried to twist away, but the light followed her, moving a fraction of a second late, then eclipsing the darkness behind. She gaped at it, stunned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦睁开眼，马上感到目眩。一道强烈的白光刺进她的脑袋。迪伦努力想转身摆脱，然而那白光却在电光火石的一瞬间也随之移动，紧紧跟着她，吞噬了身后的黑暗。迪伦看着这道光，目瞪口呆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just as suddenly as it had come, the brightness disappeared. Dylan was left staggered, blinking away dancing spots of colour. She started as a face dropped into her vision. Filled it. It was pale, coated in a sheen of sweat and smeared with inky red. A man, stubble bristling around his mouth, his lips moving urgently. Dylan tried to focus on what he was saying, but there was a high-pitched ringing in her ears, and she could hear nothing else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这道白光来得猛烈，然而转瞬间就消失了。迪伦晃晃悠悠地站在那里，眼前跳动着五颜六色的光点。不知不觉间一张脸出现在视线中，迪伦不由得吓了一跳。接着它便填满了视野。这张苍白的脸上满是闪亮的汗水和红墨水般的痕迹。这是一张男人的脸，嘴边的胡楂很浓密，看口型他好像在急切地说着什么。迪伦努力集中精力想听清他说些什么，但尖厉的耳鸣声让她什么也听不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can you hear me? Look at me. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The man looked relieved. He flashed the little penlight across her face again for a moment, causing her to screw up her eyes against the assault of white, then ran it down the length of her body. Dylan watched him train it on her legs, his expression anxious. He looked back up at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个人看上去如释重负。他又用小手电照了照她的脸，亮光晃得她的眼睛眯了起来。接着那人又用手电把她的身上从上到下照了一遍。迪伦看见他把光对准了自己的双腿，脸上露出焦虑的神色，接着又重新看着迪伦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can you move your arms and legs? Can you feel that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你能动一动胳膊和腿吗？有感觉吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," she mumbled, spitting through a mouth filled with liquid too hot, too thick to be saliva. She swallowed, tasting something metallic on her tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“能。”她终于吐出了一个字。嘴里满是热乎乎黏稠的液体，不可能是唾液。她咽了一下，感觉舌尖有股金属的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything hurt. Just… everything. Her head was throbbing, her ribs clasped in a grip of iron that was squeezing far too tight. Where her stomach should be was a pool of molten lava, burning like acid. And below that? She shut her eyes, tried to feel her legs. Were they there? Maybe she just couldn't feel them because of the waves of excruciating pain coming from everywhere else. Panicking, she felt her heart start to pound, and every ache around her body spiked in tandem with its furious beats. She tried to move her feet, to shift position; she was so uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="全身每一处都在痛。的的确确就是……每一处。她的头感到阵阵抽痛，肋骨像是被什么东西紧紧挤压着，胃里好像有一池酸性的岩浆在燃烧。再往下呢？她闭上眼，尽力感觉双腿的反应。它们在哪儿？也许她感觉不到它们只是因为折磨人的疼痛正从全身各处如潮水般袭来。迪伦惊恐万分，感觉心脏开始剧烈跳动，狂乱的心跳让她全身每一处痛感都急剧飙升。她尽力想挪挪脚步，换换位置，感觉不舒服极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦尽量集中注意力。她能有什么感觉？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Red fire. Pain. Agony. Torture. She stopped breathing, frightened even of the tiny movement of her rising chest. What was wrong with her?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Okay, okay, love?" The man was frowning, the penlight clenched between his teeth, hands moving somewhere below Dylan's waist. He stopped whatever he was doing and wiped his hand on his jacket. Dylan raked her eyes over the ugly contrast of hi-vis yellow and mouldy green jacket. There was an emblem stitched onto his shoulder, but she couldn't focus on that. Was that blood he'd just wiped away? Blood from where he'd been touching her legs? Ragged gasps started hissing between her lips, each breath stabbing at her lungs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，好了，亲爱的。”那个男人皱了皱眉，他咬着小手电，手在迪伦腰下挪动着。然后他停了一下，把手在马甲上蹭了蹭。迪伦的眼睛掠过那件黄绿色对比强烈、其丑无比的马甲。他的肩上别着一个徽标，但迪伦的注意力不在这儿。他刚才擦掉的是血吗？他刚才摸到了她腿上的伤口，血是从那里来的吗？她的呼吸开始变得急促，每一次呼吸都让肺部刺痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dylan," she whimpered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迪伦。”她的声音带着哭腔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan made herself look at him, tried to think through the terror. "What's your name?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦强迫自己看着他，尽力要把眼前可怕的事情想清楚。“你叫什么名字？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mww!" It was somewhere between a gasp and a whimper. She'd only moved her legs a tiny bit, a cenitmetre maybe, but the explosion of agony that jolted through her had been enough to take her breath away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔—呜！”她这一声听起来像是喘息，又像是呜咽。她只把双腿挪了一点点，可能只有一厘米左右，然而浑身迸发的痛苦让她发出足以窒息的颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Love?" The man was gripping her shoulder, shaking it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的？”那个人抓着她的肩膀，晃了晃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dylan, I have to go away. Just for a minute. But I'll be right back, I promise."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迪伦，我要离开一下，就一分钟。不过我马上就回来，我保证。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smiled at her, then stood up and began to jink his way down the carriage. As Dylan watched him go, she realised the thin coach was crowded with men and women in jackets: firemen, police, paramedics. Most of them were hunkered over seats or in new-made gaps, talking, treating, comforting -- their faces grim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他冲她笑笑，然后起身，沿着车厢一路挤过去。迪伦看着他离开，这才注意到这节窄窄的车厢里满是穿着马甲的男男女女—消防队员、警察，还有医护人员。他们中大多数人都蹲在座位旁，或者夹在刚出现的人缝中，他们跟迪伦谈话、交流，温言抚慰她。每个人的脸色都很凝重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She remembered falling, bracing herself, arms stretched out, her only thought not tumbling down to lie with the bodies on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想起刚才自己身子往下倒，为防不测，胳膊向外伸，当时脑子里只想着不要摔倒在地，和地上的那些尸体躺在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wait," she croaked, far too late. She raised her hand, reaching in the direction he had disappeared, but the small effort exhausted her. She let her arm fold in half, dropping her hand to her face. It was wet. Her searching fingers found a mixture of tears, sweat and blood. Drawing her hand back, she stared at the shining mixture, glistening in the artificial brightness of torches and emergency lighting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等一下。”她哑着嗓子说。然而话说得太晚了。她抬起手，伸向他消失的方向，但稍微一动就让她异常疲惫，她的手缩回来，无力地垂到脸上。脸湿漉漉的，她的手指一摸，发现上面沾着泪水、汗水和血水。她把手撤回来，仔细端详，那层混合物在手电和应急灯这些人造光源的照射下闪闪发亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She'd let go of him. She'd let go of him to save herself, to keep her face out of the blood, the debris of death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她松开了他。她松开了他为了自救，为了脸不至于沾到人死后残存的血迹上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦的肺部很痛，但她忍不住气喘吁吁，而且感觉一阵反胃。眼睛像被什么东西蜇了一样，喉咙里堵得厉害。此刻不管什么伤痛都变得无足轻重了，迪伦的泪水肆意地流淌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frantically, she shuffled position on the floor, then she thrust her hand into her pocket, ignoring the searing pain every movement triggered, fingers desperately searching. Her heart stopped for a painful moment. It was there. The flower. If that had made it through…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她几近疯狂地在地板上挪动着身体，然后把手插进裤袋，手指绝望地摸索着，全然不顾自己的每个动作都会引来一阵剧痛。她的心脏有一阵子痛苦地停止了跳动。那朵花，它还在，如果花能穿越过来……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right, this is her. Dylan?" Her name distracted her for a moment. "Dylan, we're going to slide you onto this board, love. All right? We need to get you outside, get a proper look at your injuries. Once we've got you in the ambulance we'll give you something for the pain. Can you understand me? Dylan, nod if you can understand me, sweetheart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，就是她。迪伦？”有人叫她的名字，这让她分神了片刻，“迪伦，我们要把你轻轻移到担架上，亲爱的。没问题吧？我们需要把你抬到外面，好好检查一下你的伤势。只要把你送上救护车，我们就会给你止痛的。你能听明白我说的话吗？迪伦，亲爱的，要是听明白了就点点头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded obediently. She understood. An ambulance. Painkillers would be good; they'd help put out the fire burning in her belly. But they wouldn't do anything for the gaping hole in her chest, the agony of being so empty. What had she done?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她顺从地点了点头，她听明白了。她正躺在一辆救护车上，止痛药固然好，能帮她平息腹部的灼烧感，然而它们却无力医治她心里裂开的口子，那种怅然若失、空落落的痛楚。她究竟做了些什么啊？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took the men a while to get her loaded onto the ugly yellow stretcher. A high plastic collar was fixed round her neck, forcing her to stare up at the ceiling. The men were gentle, reassuring her constantly, worried about hurting her further. Dylan hardly heard them. It was all she could do to answer their questions, to squeeze yes and no through her lips. She was glad when they started to lift her, when she didn't have to listen, and didn't have to talk any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们费了一会儿工夫把她抬到一个丑陋的黄色担架上。她的脖子被一个高高的塑料颈围固定住了，她只能盯着天花板。人们都轻手轻脚，不断好言安慰着她，生怕一不小心加重她的伤势。迪伦几乎听不到他们说话，她能做的只有回答他们的问题，从嘴里费力地挤出一个“是”或者“不”。他们把她抬起来的时候，她感到了片刻的欣慰，因为这时她既不用听他们讲话，也不用回答他们的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shuffling backwards, a careful step at a time, the two men eased Dylan into the murky grey of an autumn evening. She watched the stone archway, cut elegantly into the side of the hill, spit her out and then slowly recede, the gaping chasm reduced to quiet black. About ten metres away from the tunnel entrance, they turned her, began the lurching journey up the steep embankment. And that was when she saw him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身后响着沙沙的脚步声，每一步都小心翼翼。两个人就这样把迪伦稳稳当当地抬入了秋日傍晚灰蒙蒙的暮色中。迪伦看着出现在半山腰的精巧的石拱门，他们抬着她穿过石门，随后渐行渐远，石门张开的大口随即湮没在黑暗中。出了隧道口大概走了十米，他们转了方向，开始步履蹒跚地攀上陡峭的路堤。就在此时，迪伦看到了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Getting her out of the carriage seemed to take a long time, but once they had her out and their feet crunched against the stones of the tunnel floor, she felt them moving along at a brisk walk. They seemed keen to get her outside as quickly as possible. Dylan couldn't quite find it within herself to be alarmed by this fact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="把她抬出车厢花的时间似乎要更长。不过当他们出了车厢，脚踩到了隧道路面的石头上时，她就感觉到他们的脚步立刻变得轻盈起来。他们似乎急着把她抬到外面，越快越好。迪伦的心里丝毫没有因此而惊慌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air changed as she was bumped and jostled along the tunnel. Wisps of breeze broke through the stagnant dampness and a fine mist of raindrops caught in the tendrils of her tangled fringe, cooled the fiery heat of her forehead. Dylan tried to look behind, to see around where the paramedic was leading her head-first out of the tunnel, but the neck brace and the straps around her shoulders meant she couldn't move much at all, and trying to roll her eyes up and back sent stabbing pains shooting around her skull. Still, she glimpsed a blurry halo of natural brightness before she had to collapse back down onto the bed of the stretcher, panting from the tiny exertion. She was almost out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="躺在担架上的迪伦在颠簸中朝前移动着，周围的空气变得跟之前大不一样了。一阵阵微风吹散了郁积的潮气，水雾凝成的小水珠滴在她蓬乱的刘海上，让她燥热的额头略感清凉。一些医护人员们正在前头带路，迪伦尽力想回头看，看看四周。无奈脖子已经被牢牢地固定住了，肩膀也被皮带绑着，所以她根本没办法大幅度移动身体，而且来回翻动几下眼球也会让她的脑袋一阵刺痛。不过，在气喘吁吁地躺到担架床上之前，她还是瞥见了一团模糊的自然光晕。她快要出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was sitting to the left of the tunnel entrance, his hands wrapped around his knees, and he was staring at her. From this far away all that she could tell was that he was a boy, probably a teenager, with sandy hair that was being tossed around by the wind and whipping all around his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他坐在隧道出口的左侧，手放在膝盖上，注视着她。在这个距离望过去，只能辨认出他是个男孩，大概十几岁的样子。山风吹乱了他浅茶色的头发，拍打着他的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨。”他喃喃地说，伸出一只手轻柔地拍了拍迪伦身上的毯子．他的手指顺着她身体一侧慢慢划过，最后紧紧抓住了她的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone stepped in between them, cut him off from her. A fireman. Dylan watched as whoever it was stooped down, wrapped a blanket around Tristan's shoulders. He said something to him, a question. She watched Tristan shake his head. Slowly, slightly awkwardly, he levered himself up from the grass. Saying a final word to the fireman, he started shuffling in her direction. Just before he reached her side, he smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，一个人走过来隔在了他们之间，是一个消防队员。迪伦静静地看着他俯下身子，给崔斯坦的肩上披上了一条毯子。那人在向他询问着什么，迪伦看到崔斯坦摇了摇头。接着他慢慢地、有点笨手笨脚地从草地上站了起来。对着消防队员讲完了最后一句话后，他开始朝她的方向缓缓走来。就要走到她跟前时，他冲她一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
