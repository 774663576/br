<div class="line_en">When it happened, Langdon was unprepared. He had guessed he had another ten feet of pews until he reached the front of the church. He had guessed wrong. Without warning, the cover above him ran out. He froze for an instant, half exposed at the front of the church. Rising in the recess to his left, gargantuan from this vantage point, was the very thing that had brought him here. He had entirely forgotten. Bernini'sEcstasy of St. Teresa rose up like some sort of pornographic still life… the saint on her back, arched in pleasure, mouth open in a moan, and over her, an angel pointing his spear of fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来发生的事情，兰登毫无准备。他曾猜想自己还要爬过十迟教堂长椅，才能到达教堂前方。他猜错了。毫无预警地，他上方遮蔽的长椅没了。一时之间他僵住了，半个身子暴露在教堂前方。耸立在他左方凹室裡的高处，看来格外庞大的，正是带他来到这裡的原因。他完全忘了。贝尼尼的《圣女大德兰的狂喜》像幅色情画耸立著……圣女躺在地上，愉悦地仰著身子，张嘴呻吟，在她上方，有个天使拿著火矛往前指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon had no idea where he was going. Reflex was his only compass, driving him away from danger. His elbows and knees burned as he clambered beneath the pews. Still he clawed on. Somewhere a voice was telling him to move left. If you can get to the main aisle, you can dash for the exit. He knew it was impossible. There's a wall of flamesblocking the main aisle! His mind hunting for options, Langdon scrambled blindly on. The footsteps closed faster now to his right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登不知道要往哪裡去。他唯一的凭藉就是反射动作，带领他远离危险。由于在教堂长椅下头不断爬行，手肘和膝盖磨得很痛，但他仍继续往前爬。有个声音叫他往左移动。如果你到得了主走道，就可以衝向出口。他知道这是不可能的。有一道火墙挡住了主走道！兰登盲目往前爬，一边急切想著其他可能的办法。右方的脚步声现在离他更近了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A bullet exploded in the pew over Langdon's head. He felt his body rise like a sprinter out of a gate. Fueled only by adrenaline, and barely conscious of his actions, he was suddenly running, hunched, head down, pounding across the front of the church to his right. As the bullets erupted behind him, Langdon dove yet again, sliding out of control across the marble floor before crashing in a heap against the railing of a niche on the right-hand wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一颗子弹在兰登头上的教堂靠背长椅上炸开。他感觉自己的身体像个短跑选手衝出起跑线，由肾上腺素驱动，几乎是不自觉地突然奔跑起来，他弓身低头，脚步轰然往右衝过教堂前方。几颗子弹追在兰登身后爆开来，兰登又往下扑，不由自主地滑过地板，然后撞上了右侧墙上凹室前的栏杆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was then that he saw her. A crumpled heap near the back of the church. Vittoria! Her bare legs were twisted beneath her, but Langdon sensed somehow that she was breathing. He had no time to help her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时候，他看到她了。靠近教堂右方缩成一堆。薇多利雅！她光裸的双腿蜷在身子底下，但兰登不知怎地感觉到她还在呼吸。他没有时间帮她了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Immediately, the killer rounded the pews on the far left of the church and bore relentlessly down. Langdon knew in a heartbeat it was over. The killer raised the weapon, and Langdon did the only thing he could do. He rolled his body over the banister into the niche. As he hit the floor on the other side, the marble columns of the balustrade exploded in a storm of bullets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个杀手立刻绕过教堂另一头左边的长椅，毫不鬆懈地进逼。兰登心跳加速，知道一切结束了。杀手举起枪，兰登做了他唯一能做的事情。他翻过栏杆，进入那个凹室。撞上另一边的地板时，一波子弹猛然轰击那些大理石柱栏杆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Accompanying the roar of the gun, Langdon felt a sensation he had never felt in his life… a bullet sailing past his flesh. There was a hiss of wind, like the backlash of a whip, as the bullet just missed him and exploded in the marble with a puff of dust. Blood surging, Langdon heaved his body the rest of the way beneath the casket. Scrambling across the marble floor, he pulled himself out from beneath the casket and to the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随著那记轰隆的枪声，兰登体会到一种毕生从没有过的感觉……一颗子弹擦过他身边。有一阵嘶嘶响的风，就像鞭子抽动后的反弹般。那颗子弹没击中他，而是射中了大理石，爆出一团粉尘。兰登觉得血流速度加快，赶紧提起身子，整个钻到棺材底下。他爬过大理石地板，从棺材底下爬出来，到了另一头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon felt like a cornered animal as he scrambled deeper into the semicircular niche. Rising before him, the niche's sole contents seemed ironically apropos -- a single sarcophagus. Mine perhaps, Langdon thought. Even the casket itself seemed fitting. It was ascàtola -- a small, unadorned, marble box. Burial on a budget. The casket was raised off the floor on two marble blocks, and Langdon eyed the opening beneath it, wondering if he could slide through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登往半圆形凹室的深处爬过去，觉得自己好像一隻被逼得无路可退的动物。立在他面前的固定凹室中唯一的物品，此刻似乎讽刺又贴切──一具石棺。或许就是我的，兰登心想。即使是那个小棺材本身也似乎很适合他。那是个小型棺材──一种小小的、没有装饰的大理石盒子，为了要省钱。棺材由两块大理石砖垫高在地板上，兰登看著石棺下方的空隙，纳闷著自己能不能钻过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With no other option in sight, Langdon pressed himself to the floor and slithered toward the casket. Grabbing the two marble supports, one with each hand, he pulled like a breaststroker, dragging his torso into the opening beneath the tomb. The gun went off.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon was now face to face with the rear wall of the niche. He had no doubt that this tiny space behind the tomb would become his grave. And soon, he realized, as he saw the barrel of the gun appear in the opening beneath the sarcophagus. The Hassassin held the weapon parallel with the floor, pointing directly at Langdon's midsection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登现在面对著凹室的后墙。他毫不怀疑这个坟墓后方的狭小空间会成为他的葬身之地。而且会很快。他从石棺下方的空隙看到枪管出现，心中了然。那个哈撒辛把枪贴著地板，正对著兰登的腹部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The roar of gunfire was replaced with the cold click of an empty chamber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开火的轰鸣声被空枪膛的冰冷喀答声取代。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon felt a trace of self-preservation grip his unconscious mind. He twisted his body onto his stomach, parallel with the casket. Facedown, he planted his hands flat on the floor, the glass cut from the archives pinching open with a stab. Ignoring the pain, he pushed. Driving his body upward in an awkward push-up, Langdon arched his stomach off the floor just as the gun went off. He could feel the shock wave of the bullets as they sailed beneath him and pulverized the porous travertine behind. Closing his eyes and straining against exhaustion, Langdon prayed for the thunder to stop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登感觉到一股自我保护的本能攫住他无意识的脑袋。他弯起腹部，和石棺平行。脸朝下，双手紧贴地板，在档案室被玻璃割伤的口子被一块石片扎得好痛。他没理会那股痛，双手往下压。兰登把自己的身体撑出一个笨拙的伏地挺身姿势，腹部才堪堪抬离地板，那把枪就开火了。当子弹飞过他身下、击碎后方的石灰华之时，他可以感觉到子弹的震波。兰登闭上眼睛，努力抗拒著筋疲力竭的倦意，祈祷著雷鸣般的枪声停息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the box rolled, Langdon knew he would either be entombed in the hollow beneath it or crushed by one of the edges. Pulling in his legs and head, Langdon compacted his body and yanked his arms to his sides. Then he closed his eyes and awaited the sickening crush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="棺盒滚动之时，兰登知道自己接下来若不是被埋葬在中空的石棺裡，就是会被石棺的边缘砸中。兰登收回双腿和头部，全身缩紧，双手猛抽回放在身体两侧。然后闭上眼睛，等待石棺砸下那个令人难受的时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sarcophagus over Langdon's head suddenly seemed to rise on its side. Langdon collapsed on the floor as hundreds of pounds teetered toward him. Gravity overcame friction, and the lid was the first to go, sliding off the tomb and crashing to the floor beside him. The casket came next, rolling off its supports and toppling upside down toward Langdon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登头上的石棺突然好像高起一边。当几百磅的重量朝向兰登摇摇欲坠之时，他人也垮在地板上。地心引力击垮了摩擦力，棺盖第一个撑不住，滑出了坟墓，砸在他身旁的地板上。接下来是棺盒，滚离了底下撑著的石砖，上下翻转朝兰登罩下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sound that followed was deafening. Barely human. A guttural bellow of exertion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的声音震耳欲聋，简直不像人类发出的。那是一声竭力的沙哑呐喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon opened his eyes slowly, almost fearful his eyelids would make a sound. Fighting the trembling pain, he held his position, arched like a cat. He didn't even dare breathe. His eardrums numbed by gunfire, Langdon listened for any hint of the killer's departure. Silence. He thought of Vittoria and ached to help her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登缓缓睁开眼睛，简直担心自己的眼皮会发出声响。他痛得打颤，却还硬撑著那个姿势，弓身如猫，连呼吸都不敢。兰登的耳膜已经被枪声震得痲痹，但仍仔细倾听可有凶手离去的任何迹象。一片寂静。他想到薇多利雅，渴望能去帮她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The original occupant of the tomb was suspended above him, having adhered, as decaying bodies often did, to the bottom of the casket. The skeleton hovered a moment, like a tentative lover, and then with a sticky crackling, it succumbed to gravity and peeled away. The carcass rushed down to embrace him, raining putrid bones and dust into Langdon's eyes and mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坟墓内原来的主人悬在他上方，就像一般腐烂的尸体般，黏在棺内底部。那具骷髅悬吊了一会儿，像个踌躇的情人，然后随著一串闷闷的爆响，终于向地心引力屈服，剥落了下来。那副残骸猛坠下来拥抱他，腐臭的骨头和粉尘有如雨点般，落在兰登的双眼和嘴上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When it came, the entire floor shook beneath him. The upper rim landed only millimeters from the top of his head, rattling his teeth in their sockets. His right arm, which Langdon had been certain would be crushed, miraculously still felt intact. He opened his eyes to see a shaft of light. The right rim of the casket had not fallen all the way to the floor and was still propped partially on its supports. Directly overhead, though, Langdon found himself staring quite literally into the face of death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="砸下时，他身体底下的整个地板都在震动。石棺上缘离他头顶只有几公釐，震得他牙根都嘎嘎作响。兰登本来很确定自己的右手臂一定会被压碎，却发现奇蹟似的完整无缺。他睁开眼睛，看到了一束光。棺盒的右缘没有完全掉到地面上，一部份还撑在石棺下方的石砖上。不过就在头顶，兰登发现自己正瞪著一张不折不扣的死神脸孔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Langdon could react, a blind arm was slithering through the opening beneath the casket, sifting through the carcass like a hungry python. It groped until it found Langdon's neck and clamped down. Langdon tried to fight back against the iron fist now crushing his larynx, but he found his left sleeve pinched beneath the edge of the coffin. He had only one arm free, and the fight was a losing battle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登还没来得及反应，一隻手就滑进棺盒下头的缝隙，像飢饿的蟒蛇般在残骸间盲目翻寻。那隻手摸索著，直到发现了兰登的脖子，然后往下箝紧了。兰登想抵抗那隻箝住他喉头的铁掌，却发现自己的左袖夹在石棺的边缘底下。他只有一隻手能活动，而这是一场赢不了的战役。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a raw grinding, the sarcophagus slid off the supports and landed on the floor. The casket rim crashed onto the killer's arm, and there was a muffled scream of pain. The hand released Langdon's neck, twisting and jerking away into the dark. When the killer finally pulled his arm free, the casket fell with a conclusive thud against the flat marble floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随著一个粗哑的辗磨声，石棺滑下原来支撑的石砖，落到地板上。棺盖边缘砸在杀手的手臂上，使他冒出一声痛苦的闷喊。兰登脖子上的那隻手鬆开了，一扭一抽，缩回了黑暗中。当杀手的手臂终于抽出去，棺盒也随著一声轰然巨响，落在平坦的大理石地板上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon's legs bent in the only open space he had, his feet searching for the casket floor above him. He found it. Coiling, he planted his feet. Then, as the hand around his neck squeezed tighter, Langdon closed his eyes and extended his legs like a ram.</div>
