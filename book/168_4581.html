<div class="line_en">Beneath the castle ruins, the lower slopes of the hill were so thickly forested that half a hundred outlaws could well have been lurking there. They could be watching me even now. Merrett glanced about, and saw nothing but gorse, bracken, thistle, sedge, and blackberry bushes between the pines and grey-green sentinels. Elsewhere skeletal elm and ash and scrub oaks choked the ground like weeds. He saw no outlaws, but that meant little. Outlaws were better at hiding than honest men.</div>

<div class="line_en">The road up to Oldstones went twice around the hill before reaching the summit. Overgrown and stony, it would have been slow going even in the best of times, and last night's snow had left it muddy as well. Snow in autumn in the riverlands, it's unnatural, Merrett thought gloomily. It had not been much of a snow, true; just enough to blanket the ground for a night. Most of it had started melting away as soon as the sun came up. Still, Merrett took it for a bad omen. Between rains, floods, fire, and war, they had lost two harvests and a good part of a third. An early winter would mean famine all across the riverlands. A great many people would go hungry, and some of them would starve. Merrett only hoped he wouldn't be one of them. I may, though. With my luck, I just may. I never did have any luck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条路通往荒石城，绕两个弯才上山顶。杂草丛生、多石崎岖，好的时节尚且难走，经过昨晚那场雪，泥泞劲儿就别提了。真反常，河间地居然秋天降雪，梅里阴沉地想。当然，雪下得不大，过夜之后，太阳出来，便尽数融化。但不管怎么说，梅里仍觉得是个坏兆头。前段时间的大雨、涨水、劫掠和战争，已让人们接连失去两次收割的机会，现今连第三次也几乎就要错过。对河间地而言，若是冬天迅速到来，几乎肯定会发生饥荒。许许多多的居民将填不饱肚皮，甚至活活饿死。梅里只希望自己不要成为其中一员。就我这身运气，这不是没可能的，我从来就没有运气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was sober now, though. Well, he'd had two horns of ale when he broke his fast, and a small cup of red when he set out, but that was just to keep his head from pounding. Merrett could feel the headache building behind his eyes, and he knew that if he gave it half a chance he would soon feel as if he had a thunderstorm raging between his ears. Sometimes his headaches got so bad that it even hurt too much to weep. Then all he could do was rest on his bed in a dark room with a damp cloth over his eyes, and curse his luck and the nameless outlaw who had done this to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我现在就头痛。早餐时灌下两大角杯麦酒，出发前喝了一小杯红酒，但对他而言，这远远不够。梅里觉得眼内鼓胀，耳朵里似乎有雷霆轰鸣。很多时候，头痛发作得如此剧烈，使他忍不住涕泪齐流，唯一能做的就是回到黑暗的房间，躺上床用湿毛巾盖住眼睛，同时在心底狠狠诅咒自己的运气和那造成这一切的无名土匪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Merrett hated the woods, if truth be told, and he hated outlaws even more. "Outlaws stole my life," he had been known to complain when in his cups. He was too often in his cups, his father said, often and loudly. Too true, he thought ruefully. You needed some sort of distinction in the Twins, else they were liable to forget you were alive, but a reputation as the biggest drinker in the castle had done little to enhance his prospects, he'd found. I once hoped to be the greatest knight who ever couched a lance. The gods took that away from me. Why shouldn't I have a cup of wine from time to time? It helps my headaches. Besides, my wife is a shrew, my father despises me, my children are worthless. What do I have to stay sober for?</div>

<div class="line_en">Something moved in the underbrush along the side of the road. Merrett reined up hard and reached for his sword, but it was only a squirrel. "Stupid," he told himself, shoving the sword back in its scabbard without ever having gotten it out. "Outlaws don't have tails. Bloody hell, Merrett, get hold of yourself." His heart was thumping in his chest as if he were some green boy on his first campaign. As if this were the kingswood and it was the old Brotherhood I was going to face, not the lightning lord's sorry lot of brigands. For a moment he was tempted to trot right back down the hill and find the nearest alehouse. That bag of gold would buy a lot of ale, enough for him to forget all about Petyr Pimple. Let them hang him, he brought this on himself. It's no more than he deserves, wandering off with some bloody camp follower like a stag in rut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路边树丛里有东西在动。梅里慌忙用力勒马，伸手拔剑，却发现不过是松鼠。“傻瓜，”他责怪自己，一边把未出鞘的长剑推回去。“土匪没长尾巴，七层地狱啊，梅里，你冷静点。”他的心砰砰狂跳，活像个初上战场的小子。我面对的只是闪电大王麾下那帮乌合之众，不是御林中的老兄弟会。可在心底，他只想飞奔下山，找到最近的酒馆。一袋黄金可以买到好多好多酒啊，足以让他忘记疙瘩脸培提尔。就让他们吊死他吧，都是他自作自受，荒唐地带着营妓四处晃荡，这是个没见过世面的毛头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just thinking about it made him anxious. He could no wise afford a headache now. If I bring Petyr back home safely, all my luck will change. He had the gold, all he needed to do was climb to the top of Oldstones, meet the bloody outlaws in the ruined castle, and make the exchange. A simple ransom. Even he could not muck it up… unless he got a headache, one so bad that it left him unable to ride. He was supposed to be at the ruins by sunset, not weeping in a huddle at the side of the road. Merrett rubbed two fingers against his temple. Once more around the hill, and there I am. When the message had come in and he had stepped forward to offer to carry the ransom, his father had squinted down and said, "You, Merrett? " and started laughing through his nose, that hideous heh heh heh laugh of his. Merrett practically had to beg before they'd give him the bloody bag of gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他越想越焦虑，头也似乎越来越痛。假如我把培提尔平安带回，或许就会转运。他带了钱，只需爬上山顶的荒石城，在遗迹中会见那帮该死的土匪，做好交换就成。付付赎金，很简单，千万别搞砸了…可他的头真的好痛，连马也骑不稳。不行，日落时必须到达山顶，那是说好的时间，可不能蜷在路边哭泣。梅里伸出两根手指揉揉太阳穴。再绕一个弯，山顶就到了。前几天，当消息传来时，他二话不说，自告奋勇请求担下付赎金的任务，父亲先眯眼瞥他，“你？梅里？”接下来从鼻孔里哼出一串嘲笑，“嘿，嘿，嘿。”那是父亲招牌式的笑。到头来梅里居然得多次恳求，才得到这袋该死的金子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cursing under his breath, Merrett jammed his heels into his horse's flanks and rode on up the hill. As tempting as it was to drink the gold away, he knew that if he didn't come back with Petyr Pimple, he had as well not come back at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">His head had begun to pound; soft now, but he knew it would get worse. Merrett rubbed the bridge of his nose. He really had no right to think so ill of Petyr. I did the same myself when I was his age. In his case all it got him was a pox, but still, he shouldn't condemn. Whores did have charms, especially if you had a face like Petyr's. The poor lad had a wife, to be sure, but she was half the problem. Not only was she twice his age, but she was bedding his brother Walder too, if the talk was true. There was always lots of talk around the Twins, and only a little was ever true, but in this case Merrett believed it. Black Walder was a man who took what he wanted, even his brother's wife. He'd had Edwyn's wife too, that was common knowledge, Fair Walda had been known to slip into his bed from time to time, and some even said he'd known the seventh Lady Frey a deal better than he should have. Small wonder he refused to marry. Why buy a cow when there were udders all around begging to be milked?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="头颅里开始敲打，现在还很轻微，但他明白情形随时可能变糟。梅里揉揉鼻梁，觉得不该如此责怪培提尔。我在他这个年纪时，不也一样吗？这孩子很不幸地生了张疙瘩脸，但这并非他的错。对一个长得像培提尔那样的人而言，妓女是个难以抵挡的诱惑。可怜的小子，虽然有老婆，但这女人反而是他的心病。她的年纪是他两倍，据说还经常跟他哥哥瓦德睡觉。孪河城中每日都有无数闲言碎语，其中虚虚实实，但对培提尔这件事，梅里并不怀疑。黑瓦德是个予取予夺的蛮夫，兄弟之妻对他而言根本不在话下，众所周知，他占有过艾德温的老婆，时不时与美女瓦妲偷情，甚至和第七任佛雷夫人有染。难怪他不愿结婚，既然所有的母牛都迫不及待地等着他挤奶，干吗还专门去买一头呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

He could not possibly last much longer, all his sons agreed. And when he goes, everything will change, and not for the better.

But Stevron had died whilst campaigning with the Young Wolf in the west -- "of waiting, no doubt," Lame Lothar had quipped when the raven brought them the news -- and his sons and grandsons were a different sort of Frey. Stevron's son Ser Ryman stood to inherit now; a thick-witted, stubborn, greedy man. And after Ryman came his own sons, Edwyn and Black Walder, who were even worse.

<div class="line_en">Merrett wasn't certain that was fortunate at all, and for that matter Lothar himself might be more dangerous than either of them. Lord Walder had ordered the slaughter of the Starks at Roslin's wedding, but it had been Lame Lothar who had plotted it out with Roose Bolton, all the way down to which songs would be played. Lothar was a very amusing fellow to get drunk with, but Merrett would never be so foolish as to turn his back on him. In the Twins, you learned early that only full blood siblings could be trusted, and them not very far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里却没那么确定，反而觉得罗索比他们还危险。不错，在萝丝琳的婚礼上屠杀史塔克是瓦德侯爵自己的主意，但串通卢斯·波顿，以歌曲为信号等桩桩安排，均由跛子罗索一手操办。酒桌子上，罗索是个不错的伴，除此之外，梅里不敢对他放松警惕。孪河城内的法则是：只能相信自己的亲兄弟姐妹，而且不能信任得太多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was like to be every son for himself when the old man died, and every daughter as well. The new Lord of the Crossing would doubtless keep on some of his uncles, nephews, and cousins at the Twins, the ones he happened to like or trust, or more likely the ones he thought would prove useful to him. The rest of us he'll shove out to fend for ourselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等老人一死，连自己的亲兄弟姐妹也不能信任了。新任河渡口领主会留下一些叔叔、表弟、外甥等等，但只有那些值得信任或有用处的人才能得到机会。其他人会被统统赶出家门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The prospect worried Merrett more than words could say. He would be forty in less than three years, too old to take up the life of a hedge knight… even if he'd been a knight, which as it happened he wasn't. He had no land, no wealth of his own. He owned the clothes on his back but not much else, not even the horse he was riding. He wasn't clever enough to be a maester, pious enough to be a septon, or savage enough to be a sellsword. The gods gave me no gift but birth, and they stinted me there. What good was it to be the son of a rich and powerful House if you were the ninth son? When you took grandsons and great-grandsons into account, Merrett stood a better chance of being chosen High Septon than he did of inheriting the Twins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思及未来，梅里愁得不知怎么办才好。再过两年多，他就是四十岁的人了，做雇佣骑士都嫌太老…况且他根本没受封，连条件都达不到。他没有土地，没有钱财，只有背包里这身衣服，连骑的马都不属于他。他的头脑不足以成为学士，他的虔诚达不到修士的标准，而他的性格又决定了他当不成佣兵。诸神好吝啬啊，除了出身以外，什么也没给我。即便生在这般富裕强大的家族，作第九个儿子，又有什么用呢？把孙子，曾孙一起算上，梅里当总主教的机会都比继承孪河城的可能性大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have no luck, he thought bitterly. I have never had any bloody luck. He was a big man, broad around the chest and shoulders if only of middling height. in the last ten years he had grown soft and fleshy, he knew, but when he'd been younger Merrett had been almost as robust as Ser Hosteen, his eldest full brother, who was commonly regarded as the strongest of Lord Walder Frey's brood. As a boy he'd been packed off to Crakehall to serve his mother's family as a page. When old Lord Sumner had made him a squire, everyone had assumed he would be Ser Merrett in no more than a few years, but the outlaws of the Kingswood Brotherhood had pissed on those plans. While his fellow squire Jaime Lannister was covering himself in glory, Merrett had first caught the pox from a camp follower, then managed to get captured by a woman, the one called the White Fawn. Lord Sumner had ransomed him back from the outlaws, but in the very next fight he'd been felled by a blow from a mace that had broken his helm and left him insensible for a fortnight. Everyone gave him up for dead, they told him later.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, Merrett's luck had only grown worse. His father had managed to make a good marriage for him, somehow; he wed one of Lord Darry's daughters, back when the Darrys stood high in King Aerys's favor. But it seemed as if he no sooner had deflowered his bride than Aerys lost his throne. Unlike the Freys, the Darrys had been prominent Targaryen loyalists, which cost them half their lands, most of their wealth, and almost all their power. As for his lady wife, she found him a great disappointment from the first, and insisted on popping out nothing but girls for years; three live ones, a stillbirth, and one that died in infancy before she finally produced a son. His eldest daughter had turned out to be a slut, his second a glutton. When Ami was caught in the stables with no fewer than three grooms, he'd been forced to marry her off to a bloody hedge knight. That situation could not possibly get any worse, he'd thought… until Ser Pate decided he could win renown by defeating Ser Gregor Clegane. Ami had come running back a widow, to Merrett's dismay and the undoubted delight of every stablehand in the Twins.</div>

<div class="line_en">Merrett had dared to hope that his luck was finally changing when Roose Bolton chose to wed his WaIda instead of one of her slimmer, comelier cousins. The Bolton alliance was important for House Frey and his daughter had helped secure it; he thought that must surely count for something. The old man had soon disabused him. "He picked her because she's fat," Lord Walder said. "You think Bolton gave a mummer's fart that she was your whelp? Think he sat about thinking, 'Heh, Merrett Muttonhead, that's the very man I need for a good-father'? Your Walda's a sow in silk, that's why he picked her, and I'm not like to thank you for it.

His head was throbbing like that bloody drum they'd played at the wedding, and for a moment it was all he could do to stay in the saddle. I have to go on, he told himself.

The boy will be grateful for my part, and his father will see that I'm loyal, a man worth having about.</div>

<div class="line_en">Merrett found himself shivering, despite his cloak. He pulled open his waterskin and had another drink of wine. I could just get back on my horse, ride to Oldtown, and drink the gold away. No good ever came from dealing with outlaws. That vile little bitch Wenda had burned a fawn into the cheek of his arse while she had him captive. No wonder his wife despised him. I have to go through with this. Petyr Pimple might be Lord of the Crossing one day, Edwyn has no sons and Black Walder's only got bastards. Petyr will remember who came to get him. He took another swallow, corked the skin up, and led his palfrey through broken stones, gorse, and thin wind-whipped trees, following the sounds to what had been the castle ward.</div>

<div class="line_en">The curtain wall of Oldstones had once encircled the brow of the hill like the crown on a king's head. Only the foundation remained, and a few waist-high piles of crumbling stone spotted with lichen. Merrett rode along the line of the wall until he came to the place where the gatehouse would have stood. The ruins were more extensive here, and he had to dismount to lead his palfrey through them. In the west, the sun had vanished behind a bank of low clouds. Gorse and bracken covered the slopes, and once inside the vanished walls the weeds were chest high. Merrett loosened his sword in its scabbard and looked about warily, but saw no outlaws. Could I have come on the wrong day? He stopped and rubbed his temples with his thumbs, but that did nothing to ease the pressure behind his eyes. Seven bloody hells…</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe so. What do a bunch o' bloody peasants know about a lord's honor?" Yellow cloak wrapped the end of the rope around his hand three times. "We know some about murder, though."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许吧，咱们下力的老百姓不懂什么领主的荣誉，”黄斗篷将绳子在手上绕了三圈，“谋杀倒是懂的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Merrett could hardly think for the pounding in his head. "He shamed us, the whole realm was laughing, we had to cleanse the stain on our honor." His father had said all that and more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="头颅嗡嗡作响，梅里无法思考。“他侮辱了我们，全国上下都在笑话我们，我们必须挽回荣誉。”父亲是这样说的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not murder." His voice was shrill. "It was vengeance, we had a right to our vengeance. It was war. Aegon, we called him linglebell, a poor lackwit never hurt anyone, Lady Stark cut his throat. We lost half a hundred men in the camps. Ser Garse Goodbrook, Kyra's husband, and Ser Tytos, Jared's son… someone smashed his head in with an axe… Stark's direwolf killed four of our wolfhounds and tore the kennelmaster's arm off his shoulder, even after we'd filled him full of quarrels…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那不是谋杀，”他的声音尖得发哑，“是复仇，我们有权复仇。那是一场战争！伊耿，伊耿，可怜的痴呆，外号‘铃铛响’，他什么也没做，却被史塔克夫人割了喉咙。我们在营地还阵亡了五十多人，凯拉的丈夫高斯·古柏克爵士死了，杰瑞的长子泰陀斯爵士也死了…他被人用斧头砸中后脑…史塔克的冰原狼咬死四条狼犬，还把兽舍掌管的胳膊咬断了，之后才教乱箭射穿…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you sewed his head on Robb Stark's neck after both o' them were dead," said yellow cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以你们为了泄愤，就把狼的脑袋缝在罗柏·史塔克身上。”黄斗篷说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My father did that. All I did was drink. You wouldn't kill a man for drinking." Merrett remembered something then, something that might be the saving of him. "They say Lord Beric always gives a man a trial, that he won't kill a man unless something's proved against him. You can't prove anything against me. The Red Wedding was my father's work, and Ryman's and Lord Bolton's. Lothar rigged the tents to collapse and put the crossbowmen in the gallery with the musicians, Bastard Walder led the attack on the camps… they're the ones you want, not me, I only drank some wine… you have no witness."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是我父亲干的，我父亲干的。我只有喝酒而已，你们不能因为喝酒就杀人。”梅里突然想起一件事，一根救命稻草，“传说贝里伯爵总是先审判再定罪，不会杀无辜之人。你们没有证据！红色婚礼是我父亲干的，莱曼和波顿公爵动手杀人，罗索在大帐上做了手脚，还把十字弓手布置在楼台，黑瓦德率军踏平营地…他们才是该负责的人，不是我，我只有喝酒而已…你们没有证据！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That Young Wolf never will," said the one-eyed outlaw.</div>

<div class="line_en">"She don't speak," said the big man in the yellow cloak. "You bloody bastards cut her throat too deep for that. But she remembers." He turned to the dead woman and said, "What do you say, m'lady? Was he part of it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她不能说话——”黄斗篷的大个子解释，“——你们这帮可恨的杂种切得太深。但她记得所有事情。”他转向死去的女人。“您怎么说，夫人？他有份吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As it happens, you're wrong there." The singer turned to the hooded woman. "Milady?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Her cloak and collar hid the gash his brother's blade had made, but her face was even worse than he remembered. The flesh had gone pudding soft in the water and turned the color of curdled milk. Half her hair was gone and the rest had turned as white and brittle as a crone's. Beneath her ravaged scalp, her face was shredded skin and black blood where she had raked herself with her nails. But her eyes were the most terrible thing. Her eyes saw him, and they hated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斗篷和衣领遮住了弟弟的刀刃留下的丑陋伤痕，但她的面容比当初更可怕。血肉在河水中泡软后，成为凝固牛奶的颜色，一半的头发没了，剩下的花白脆弱，犹如百岁老妪。创痍遍布的头皮下，脸庞碎成一块一块，中间是当初她用指甲挖出的黑血。最恐怖的是她的眼睛，其中唯有赤裸裸的恨意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The outlaws parted as she came forward, saying no word. When she lowered her hood, something tightened inside Merrett's chest, and for a moment he could not breathe. No. No, I saw her die. She was dead for a day and night before they stripped her naked and threw her body in the river. Raymund opened her throat from ear to ear. She was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女子上前时，土匪们默默地让道。她揭开兜帽，梅里的心脏顿时停止了跳动。不，不，我明明看见她死了。她死了一天一夜，我们才把尸体剥个精光，赤条条地扔进河里。雷蒙德将她的喉咙从左耳切到右耳。她死了！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Merrett Frey opened his mouth to plead, but the noose choked off his words. His feet left the ground, the rope cutting deep into the soft flesh beneath his chin. Up into the air he jerked, kicking and twisting, up and up and up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里·佛雷刚想张嘴恳求，绳套便堵住了一切言语。他的脚离开地面，麻绳深深陷进下巴下的软肉里。上升，他不停地痉挛、踢打、挣扎，上升、上升、上升…">查看中文翻译</div>
