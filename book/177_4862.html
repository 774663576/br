<div class="line_en">The Easter holidays began happily. Paul was his own frank self. Yet she felt it would go wrong. On the Sunday afternoon she stood at her bedroom window, looking across at the oak-trees of the wood, in whose branches a twilight was tangled, below the bright sky of the afternoon. Grey-green rosettes of honeysuckle leaves hung before the window, some already, she fancied, showing bud. It was spring, which she loved and dreaded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Paul was dissatisfied with himself and with everything. The deepest of his love belonged to his mother. When he felt he had hurt her, or wounded his love for her, he could not bear it. Now it was spring, and there was battle between him and Miriam. This year he had a good deal against her. She was vaguely aware of it. The old feeling that she was to be a sacrifice to this love, which she had had when she prayed, was mingled in all her emotions. She did not at the bottom believe she ever would have him. She did not believe in herself primarily: doubted whether she could ever be what he would demand of her. Certainly she never saw herself living happily through a lifetime with him. She saw tragedy, sorrow, and sacrifice ahead. And in sacrifice she was proud, in renunciation she was strong, for she did not trust herself to support everyday life. She was prepared for the big things and the deep things, like tragedy. It was the sufficiency of the small day-life she could not trust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="保罗对自己甚至对世间的一切都不满意。最深沉的爱属于他母亲。每当他感到自己伤害了母亲，或损伤了他对她的爱，他就不堪忍受。已经是春天了，他和米丽亚姆之间有了激烈的冲突。这一年来，他老是和她对着干。她对此也隐约有所察觉。每当她祈祷时，那种自己注定要成为这场恋爱的牺牲品的一贯的感觉就会和她的各种情感交织在一起，她打心底里就不相信自己会拥有他。首先她就不相信自己，她怀疑自己是否能成为一个保罗所要求的那样的人，她也不会设想自己能跟他过一辈子幸福生活。她看到的前途就是悲剧、忧伤和牺牲。能够做出牺牲，她为此感到骄傲，能够克制自己，证明她坚强，因为她不相信自己能承受生活的重负。她准备着对付悲剧之类的大事和难事。她不属于日常生活的小事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He, being in a hard, ironical mood, was entertaining the family to a description of a service given in the Primitive Methodist Chapel, conducted by one of the well-known preachers of the sect. He sat at the head of the table, his mobile face, with the eyes that could be so beautiful, shining with tenderness or dancing with laughter, now taking on one expression and then another, in imitation of various people he was mocking. His mockery always hurt her; it was too near the reality. He was too clever and cruel. She felt that when his eyes were like this, hard with mocking hate, he would spare neither himself nor anybody else. But Mrs. Leivers was wiping her eyes with laughter, and Mr. Leivers, just awake from his Sunday nap, was rubbing his head in amusement. The three brothers sat with ruffled, sleepy appearance in their shirt-sleeves, giving a guffaw from time to time. The whole family loved a "take-off" more than anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用那种嘲讽刻薄的语气绘神绘色地向她家人讲美以美教会守旧派一个著名的传教士在教堂里做礼拜的情形。他坐在餐桌的一头，脸上表情丰富多变，学着那个他嘲讽的对象的模样。两只漂亮迷人的眼睛一会儿闪着柔和的光，一会儿又眉飞色舞。他的嘲弄伤害了她：因为模仿得太逼真了。他过于敏锐，也过于残忍。每当他眼睛这样冷，这样充满嘲讽的恨意，她就知道他一定不会放过任何人，甚至她自己。可是雷渥斯太太却笑得直擦眼泪。刚从星期日午睡中醒来的雷渥斯先生，也乐得直摸脑袋，三个兄弟只穿着衬衫坐在那儿，脸上还挂着睡意，听得也不时地哈哈大笑，全家人都非常欣赏他这种模仿和嘲弄他人的“表演”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hearing the clack of the gate she stood in suspense. It was a bright grey day. Paul came into the yard with his bicycle, which glittered as he walked. Usually he rang his bell and laughed towards the house. To-day he walked with shut lips and cold, cruel bearing, that had something of a slouch and a sneer in it. She knew him well by now, and could tell from that keen-looking, aloof young body of his what was happening inside him. There was a cold correctness in the way he put his bicycle in its place, that made her heart sink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大门咯吱一响，她不安地站在那儿。天气阴沉着。保罗推着锃亮的自行车进了院子。平时，他总是摁着车铃走向屋子。今天，他走进来时，却双唇紧闭，举上露出一股冷酷、懒散而嘲讽的神情。她现在已对他了如指掌，从他那敏锐、高傲的外表，就能推测出他的内心。他不经意地把车停在老地方，米丽亚姆看着不禁心里一沉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She came downstairs nervously. She was wearing a new net blouse that she thought became her. It had a high collar with a tiny ruff, reminding her of Mary, Queen of Scots, and making her, she thought, look wonderfully a woman, and dignified. At twenty she was full-breasted and luxuriously formed. Her face was still like a soft rich mask, unchangeable. But her eyes, once lifted, were wonderful. She was afraid of him. He would notice her new blouse.</div>

<div class="line_en">She thought his sarcasms were unnecessary. They went forward in silence. Round the wild, tussocky lawn at the back of the house was a thorn hedge, under which daffodils were craning forward from among their sheaves of grey-green blades. The cheeks of the flowers were greenish with cold. But still some had burst, and their gold ruffled and glowed. Miriam went on her knees before one cluster, took a wild-looking daffodil between her hands, turned up its face of gold to her, and bowed down, caressing it with her mouth and cheeks and brow. He stood aside, with his hands in his pockets, watching her. One after another she turned up to him the faces of the yellow, bursten flowers appealingly, fondling them lavishly all the while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米丽亚姆认为他的讥讽毫无必要。他俩默默地往前走着，有一堵荆棘树篱绕着屋后的那片长满野草的草坪，树篱下的水仙花正从浅绿色的叶丛中探出头来。花瓣呈绿色，略透着寒意，不过还是开了几朵，金黄色的花朵摇曳多姿，灿烂生辉。米丽亚姆跪在一簇水仙花前，捧起一朵野花似的水仙，低下头去，用嘴唇、脸颊和额头接受着金黄色的花瓣。他站在旁边，双手插在口袋里看着她。她把花一朵一朵地转向保罗。一边两手仍不停地抚弄着这些花。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this time he gave all his friendship to Edgar. He loved the family so much, he loved the farm so much; it was the dearest place on earth to him. His home was not so lovable. It was his mother. But then he would have been just as happy with his mother anywhere. Whereas Willey Farm he loved passionately. He loved the little pokey kitchen, where men's boots tramped, and the dog slept with one eye open for fear of being trodden on; where the lamp hung over the table at night, and everything was so silent. He loved Miriam's long, low parlour, with its atmosphere of romance, its flowers, its books, its high rosewood piano. He loved the gardens and the buildings that stood with their scarlet roofs on the naked edges of the fields, crept towards the wood as if for cosiness, the wild country scooping down a valley and up the uncultured hills of the other side. Only to be there was an exhilaration and a joy to him. He loved Mrs. Leivers, with her unworldliness and her quaint cynicism; he loved Mr. Leivers, so warm and young and lovable; he loved Edgar, who lit up when he came, and the boys and the children and Bill -- even the sow Circe and the Indian game-cock called Tippoo. All this besides Miriam. He could not give it up.</div>

<div class="line_en">One Sunday evening they attained to their old rare harmony. Edgar had stayed to Communion -- he wondered what it was like -- with Mrs. Morel. So Paul came on alone with Miriam to his home. He was more or less under her spell again. As usual, they were discussing the sermon. He was setting now full sail towards Agnosticism, but such a religious Agnosticism that Miriam did not suffer so badly. They were at the Renan Vie de Jesus stage. Miriam was the threshing-floor on which he threshed out all his beliefs. While he trampled his ideas upon her soul, the truth came out for him. She alone was his threshing-floor. She alone helped him towards realization. Almost impassive, she submitted to his argument and expounding. And somehow, because of her, he gradually realized where he was wrong. And what he realized, she realized. She felt he could not do without her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个星期天的晚上，他们的关系又达到了过去那少有的和谐。艾德加留下跟莫瑞尔太太一起等领圣餐——他不知道领圣餐是怎么一回事。因此，保罗就独自陪米丽亚姆一起回到自己家。他又或多或少地被她迷住了，象往常一样，他俩又谈论着布道。此时他正在不可知论领域里游荡。米丽亚姆对宗教的不可知论没有什么受不了的。他们对勒南的《耶稣传》争论不休，米丽亚姆成了他争论的讲坛，他借助它把自己的信念都摆了出来。就在他把自己的思想竭力向她的内心灌输时，他似乎觉得真理越来越清晰了。只有她一个人成了他争论的讲坛，只有她一个人帮助他认清道理。她对他的争论和解释几乎无动于衷，丝毫不加辩解。可不知怎么的，就是因为她这样，他逐渐认识到自己错在哪儿。而他所意识到的，她也意识到了。她觉得他少不了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he went as often, but he was usually with Edgar. Only all the family, including the father, joined in charades and games at evening. And later, Miriam drew them together, and they read Macbeth out of penny books, taking parts. It was great excitement. Miriam was glad, and Mrs. Leivers was glad, and Mr. Leivers enjoyed it. Then they all learned songs together from tonic sol-fa, singing in a circle round the fire. But now Paul was very rarely alone with Miriam. She waited. When she and Edgar and he walked home together from chapel or from the literary society in Bestwood, she knew his talk, so passionate and so unorthodox nowadays, was for her. She did envy Edgar, however, his cycling with Paul, his Friday nights, his days working in the fields. For her Friday nights and her French lessons were gone. She was nearly always alone, walking, pondering in the wood, reading, studying, dreaming, waiting. And he wrote to her frequently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，他还是经常去，只不过他通常都是和艾德加呆在一起，只有到了晚上全家人包括父亲，聚在一起玩字迷、做游戏。尔后，米丽亚姆又把大家都聚拢来，朗诵《麦克白斯》之类的书，大家各自扮演一个角色，玩的可真痛快。米丽亚姆很高兴，雷渥斯太太也很高兴，连雷渥斯先生也玩得很投入。接着，一家人就围着火炉，根据首调唱法学着唱歌。这样一来，保罗就很少单独和米丽亚姆在一起。她等待着。每当她和他还有艾德加从教堂或从贝斯伍德文学联谊会堂一起往家走时，她终于明白了他的意图。深情的、常带有异端邪说的话都是说给她听的。然而，她还是嫉妒艾德加，嫉妒他陪保罗骑自行车，嫉妒他每星期五晚上与保罗呆在一起，嫉妒他们白天又一起在田里劳动。因为她的星期五晚上和法语课都已成为了过去。她几乎总是独自一人散步，在树林里溜跶，看书、学习、冥想、等待。他仍然频繁地写信给她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They came to the silent house. He took the key out of the scullery window, and they entered. All the time he went on with his discussion. He lit the gas, mended the fire, and brought her some cakes from the pantry. She sat on the sofa, quietly, with a plate on her knee. She wore a large white hat with some pinkish flowers. It was a cheap hat, but he liked it. Her face beneath was still and pensive, golden-brown and ruddy. Always her ears were hid in her short curls. She watched him.</div>

<div class="line_en">She liked him on Sundays. Then he wore a dark suit that showed the lithe movement of his body. There was a clean, clear-cut look about him. He went on with his thinking to her. Suddenly he reached for a Bible. Miriam liked the way he reached up -- so sharp, straight to the mark. He turned the pages quickly, and read her a chapter of St. John. As he sat in the armchair reading, intent, his voice only thinking, she felt as if he were using her unconsciously as a man uses his tools at some work he is bent on. She loved it. And the wistfulness of his voice was like a reaching to something, and it was as if she were what he reached with. She sat back on the sofa away from him, and yet feeling herself the very instrument his hand grasped. It gave her great pleasure.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he began to falter and to get self-conscious. And when he came to the verse, "A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow because her hour is come", he missed it out. Miriam had felt him growing uncomfortable. She shrank when the well-known words did not follow. He went on reading, but she did not hear. A grief and shame made her bend her head. Six months ago he would have read it simply. Now there was a scotch in his running with her. Now she felt there was really something hostile between them, something of which they were ashamed.</div>

Never yet had he been forced to realise himself. The army had disciplined his body, but not his soul. He was in perfect health and very handsome. His dark, vigorous hair sat close to his smallish head. There was something childish about his nose, something almost girlish about his dark blue eyes. But he had the fun red mouth of a man under his brown moustache, and his jaw was strong. It was his father's mouth; it was the nose and eyes of her own mother's people -- good-looking, weak-principled folk. Mrs. Morel was anxious about him. Once he had really run the rig he was safe.

The two often went long walks together, Arthur taking her arm in soldier's fashion, rather stiffly. And she came to play the piano whilst he sang. Then Arthur would unhook his tunic collar. He grew flushed, his eyes were bright, he sang in a manly tenor. Afterwards they sat together on the sofa.

Annie was a married woman, Arthur was following his own pleasure in a way unknown to his folk. For so long they had all lived at home, and gone out to pass their time. But now, for Annie and Arthur, life lay outside their mother's house. They came home for holiday and for rest. So there was that strange, half-empty feeling about the house, as if the birds had flown. Paul became more and more unsettled. Annie and Arthur had gone. He was restless to follow.

<div class="line_en">Miriam had one beautiful evening with him in the hay. He had been on the horse-rake, and having finished, came to help her to put the hay in cocks. Then he talked to her of his hopes and despairs, and his whole soul seemed to lie bare before her. She felt as if she watched the very quivering stuff of life in him. The moon came out: they walked home together: he seemed to have come to her because he needed her so badly, and she listened to him, gave him all her love and her faith. It seemed to her he brought her the best of himself to keep, and that she would guard it all her life. Nay, the sky did not cherish the stars more surely and eternally than she would guard the good in the soul of Paul Morel. She went on home alone, feeling exalted, glad in her faith.</div>

He made higher and higher heaps of hay that they were jumping over. Miriam did not care for the game, and stood aside. Edgar and Geoffrey and Maurice and Clara and Paul jumped. Paul won, because he was light. Clara's blood was roused. She could run like an Amazon. Paul loved the determined way she rushed at the hay-cock and leaped, landed on the other side, her breasts shaken, her thick hair come undone.</div>

You see, I can give you a spirit love, I have given it you this long, long time; but not embodied passion. See, you are a nun. I have given you what I would give a holy nun -- as a mystic monk to a mystic nun. Surely you esteem it best. Yet you regret -- no, have regretted -- the other. In all our relations no body enters. I do not talk to you through the senses -- rather through the spirit. That is why we cannot love in the common sense. Ours is not an everyday affection. As yet we are mortal, and to live side by side with one another would be dreadful, for somehow with you I cannot long be trivial, and, you know, to be always beyond this mortal state would be to lose it. If people marry, they must live together as affectionate humans, who may be commonplace with each other without feeling awkward -- not as two souls. So I feel it.</div>
