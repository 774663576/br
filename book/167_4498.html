<div class="line_en">When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was near. It will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while, he told himself while he hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree. Ghost sat on his haunches watching, silent as ever. Will he howl for me when I'm dead, as Bran's wolf howled when he fell? Jon wondered. Will Shaggydog howl, far off in Winterfell, and Grey Wind and Nymeria, wherever they might be?</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared. Qhorin came and stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry pine needles. "As shy as a maid on her wedding night," the big ranger said in a soft voice, "and near as fair. Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月亮从山的这边升起，太阳从山的那头落下，琼恩用打火石和小刀摩擦生火，好容易弄出一缕青烟。火苗摇曳，在刮下的树皮和枯死干燥的松针上蔓延，科林走到他身边。“含羞的新娘，”高大的游骑兵轻声道，“如花的美貌。火的美，真让人击节赞叹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was not a man you'd expect to speak of maids and wedding nights. So far as Jon knew, Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch. Did he ever love a maid or have a wedding? He could not ask. Instead he fanned the fire. When the blaze was all acrackle, he peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as good. The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不像是那种会谈论美女和新娘的男人。据琼恩所知，科林把一生都献给守夜人。他爱过女人？结过婚吗？问题难以出口，于是他只默默煽动火苗。当篝火熊熊，他摘下硬邦邦的手套，温暖掌心，不由自主地发出一声轻叹，哪有比这更甜美的亲吻呢？暖意如熔化的黄油，在指尖扩散。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind them echoing against the mountains. Each time it seemed a little louder, a little closer. When night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire's garron as well as his own, and ride east for Mormont with all haste, back the way they had come. The rest of them would draw off the pursuit. "Send Jon," Ebben had urged. "He can ride as fast as me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后这一天，他们至少两次看见那鹰，猎号也一直在身后的群山中回荡。一响高过一响，一声近似一声。等夜幕降临，断掌吩咐伊班带上自己和侍从的马，沿来路向东朝莫尔蒙的营地全速前进。其他人将为他引开追兵。“派琼恩去，”伊班劝阻，“他身手敏捷，不逊于我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering light playing across the hard planes of his face. Only the two of them remained of the five rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass, back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="断掌在火边席地盘腿而坐，摇曳的光亮照着他脸上坚毅的线条。从风声峡撤退的五个游骑兵只剩他们两人，终日在霜雪之牙无垠的蓝灰荒野中亡命躲藏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled up in the pass. But when they'd heard the call of a faroff horn every man of them knew the squire had fallen. Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before he could so much as string it. Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初琼恩心存侥幸，希望侍从戴里吉在峡口拦住野人，但猎号沉寂片刻后又二度响起，人人心照不宣：侍从已然丧命。接着，那只老鹰再次出现，它张开雄伟的灰蓝翅膀翱翔在暮霭的天空。石蛇弯弓瞄准，鸟儿却在他放箭前飞出射程。伊班啐口唾沫，低声咒骂狼灵和易形者。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the moon rose, Ebben parted from them. Stonesnake went east with him a short way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the southwest.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that the days and nights blurred one into the other. They slept in their saddles and stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again. Over bare rock they rode, through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow, over icy ridges and across shallow rivers that had no names. Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep away their tracks, but it was a futile gesture. They were watched. At every dawn and every dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks, no more than a speck in the vastness of the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们日夜兼程，加急赶路，睡卧马鞍，只是饮马时方才稍作休息，之后又继续前进。他们踏过光秃的岩石，穿行阴郁的松林和陈年的积雪，翻越冰脊，跨过无名的浅河。科林和石蛇不时折返去清扫踪迹，但只是白费功夫。他们一直被监视。每个清晨，每个黄昏，老鹰盘旋在山峰之巅，犹如长天中的一个点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came snarling from its lair, not ten yards away. The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight of it sent Stonesnake's mare into a panic; she reared and ran, and before the ranger could get her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一次，当他们走过雪峰之间的低矮山脊时，影子山猫从巢穴里出来咆哮，离人们不足十码。尽管野兽憔悴而饥饿，但石蛇的母马还是惊慌失措，掀人落马，飞跑逃跑，等找到它，它已绊在陡坡上，摔断了腿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron's blood with their oats, to give them strength. The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, but he forced it down. They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，白灵饱餐一顿，科林则坚持要大家将马血混进燕麦，以增强体力。味道刺鼻的麦粥呛得琼恩难受，但他勉力为之。上路之前，他们各自从马尸上割下十几条生肉，剩下的都留给了影子山猫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no question of riding double. Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit and surprise them when they came. Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to hell. Qhorin refused. "if any man in the Night's Watch can make it through the Frostfangs alone and afoot, it is you, brother. You can go over mountains that a horse must go around. Make for the Fist. Tell Mormont what Jon saw, and how. Tell him that the old powers are waking, that he faces giants and wargs and worse. Tell him that the trees have eyes again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人同骑不可想像。石蛇自愿留下，奇袭追兵，他说或能在下地狱前拼掉几个。科林拒绝了。“如果说守夜人中还有谁能独步穿越霜雪之牙，那就是你，兄弟。马儿上不了的山你能上。回拳峰去。把琼恩的见闻、以及他见闻的方式告诉莫尔蒙。告诉他，古老的力量已经苏醒，他必须面对巨人、狼灵和更可怕的事物。告诉他，树眼再现。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?" asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的剑可还锋利，琼恩·雪诺？”透过闪烁的篝火，断掌科林问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely. Ghost was not always with them, but he was never far either. Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his nearness. He was glad for that. The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men. Qhorin's long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse. Often they would ride for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights. When he slept, he did not dream; not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything. Even dreams cannot live up here, he told himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自那天起，每个夜晚都更趋凄冷，更趋孤单。白灵不总在身边，但从未离得太远。就算分开，琼恩也能感觉他的存在，对此深感欣慰。断掌是个不苟言笑的人，平日只见他默默骑马，长长的灰辫子缓缓甩动，几个钟头也没一句交流，惟一的声音是马蹄在石上的轻踏和冷风的恸哭。高山之上，风从未宁息。而今他常能无梦入眠：梦不到狼，梦不到兄弟，惟有空虚。诸神的诅咒之地，连造梦也没有空间，他告诉自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you like." Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon, while Ghost listened and the mountains themselves bore witness. "Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是。”高悬的明月之下，两人的声音和为一体，白灵和群山是他们的见证。“长夜将至，我从今开始守望，至死方休。我将不娶妻，不封地，不生子。我将不戴宝冠，不争荣宠。我将尽忠职守，生死于斯。我是黑暗中的利剑，长城上的守卫，抵御寒冷的烈焰，破晓时分的光线，唤醒眠者的号角，守护王国的坚盾！我将生命与荣耀献给守夜人，今夜如此，夜夜皆然。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in his mind, praying that his father's gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour came. It would not be long now. The garrons were near the end of their strength. Qhorin's mount would not last another day, Jon suspected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诵毕，天地间惟有火苗的噼啪和晚风的微叹。琼恩热切地舒展灼伤的手掌，誓词在脑海中不断回响，他向父亲的无名诸神祷告，请让自己勇敢赴死。快了，马儿到了体力透支的极限。琼恩知道，科林的马甚至连明天也熬不过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们骑得越远，两边的峭壁就压迫得越紧。月光下，溪流如缎带，指引他们直向源头。石岸上全是冰，但在细薄的硬壳下，琼恩听见潺潺水声。">查看中文翻译</div>

Beyond, the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall. The air was full of mist, like the breath of some vast cold beast. The tumbling waters shone silver in the moonlight. Jon looked about in dismay. There is no way out. He and Qhorin might be able to climb the cliffs, but not with the horses.

When he did not reappear, Jon put his heels into his horse and went after. His garron did his best to shy away. The falling water slapped at them with frozen fists, and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon's breath.</div>

Qhorin seated himself on the sand, his back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of the cave.

<div class="line_en">He took off his wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further. Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep. Jon was grateful for his warmth. He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if it had gone out by now. If the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out. The moon shone through the curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand, but after a time that too faded and went dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他脱下湿斗篷，但此地又冷又潮，不容他再脱。白灵摊开身体，蜷缩在旁边睡觉，舔了舔他的手套。琼恩感激他的温暖，心里又想起野外的篝火，不知此刻是否熄灭？倘若长城沦陷，天下的火将全部熄灭。月光一度透过奔涌的水帘，在沙地撒下数道苍白式微的条纹，但很快褪去，一切又重归黑暗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sleep came at last, and with it nightmares. He dreamed of burning castles and dead men rising unquiet from their graves. It was still dark when Qhorin woke him.

<div class="line_en">At break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled their garrons once again, and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders. During his watch the Halfhand had made a halfdozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he carried in his saddlebag. He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding the pale flame up before him. Jon followed with the horses. The stony path twisted and turned, first down, then up, then down more steeply. In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to convince the garrons they could squeeze through. By the time we come out we will have lost them, he told himself as they went. Not even an eagle can see through solid stone. We will have lost them, and we will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all we know…</div>

<div class="line_en">Qhorin drew his longsword. The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend; it was said that he handled a blade better now than he ever had before.

<div class="line_en">The hunters approached warily, perhaps fearing arrows. Jon counted fourteen, with eight dogs. Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted with skulls. About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather. On either wing, archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows, but did not loose. The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls. One had a chipped stone axe. They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids. Wildlings did not mine or smelt, and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the Wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎人们小心翼翼地靠拢，以防遭飞箭攻击。琼恩数了一下，共有十四人，外加八条狗。他们巨大的圆盾乃是柳条编成，覆盖人皮，涂上骷髅图案。约有一半人用木头和熟皮制的粗糙头盔遮脸。左右两翼，各有一名射手将箭搭上由木头和兽角做成的短弓，但没释放。其他人装备长矛或大槌，还有一人握着有裂口的石斧。看得出，他们身上那点破烂的护具不是抢来，便是得自于死去的游骑兵。野人既不挖矿也不会冶炼，长城以北，铁匠寥寥可数，锻炉更是稀罕。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Is that your wolf, boy?" a skinny youth called, unlimbering a stone flail. "He'll be my cloak before the sun is down."

Jon planted and pivoted. The ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon's slash had not touched him. Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man's throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使白灵用牙齿狠狠撕扯游骑兵的小腿，科林还是踏稳了脚步。但在那一瞬间，当他扭身时，露出了破绽。琼恩一剑递出，反手一撩。游骑兵向外让开，似乎这一击未起作用，但紧接着喉头浮现一连串朱红的泪滴，明亮鲜活，犹如红宝石的项链。最后血如泉涌，断掌科林倒了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ghost's muzzle was dripping red, but only the point of the bastard blade was stained, the last half inch. Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him. The light was already fading in Qhorin's eyes. "… sharp," he said, lifting his maimed fingers. Then his hand fell, and he was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白灵的口鼻也在滴血，但长柄剑只锋尖有染，在最后的半寸。琼恩把冰原狼赶开，跪下来搂住兄弟。最后一丝光芒正从科林眼中褪去。“…锋利。”他说，伤残的手指举起又落下。他死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he'd fallen, on a pyre made of pine needles, brush, and broken branches.
