<div class="line_en">"This is my fault!" she muttered. "I have a genius for doing things wrong! I could have kept Miss Angorian indoors. I only needed to talk to her politely, poor thing! Howl may have forgiven me a lot of things, but he's not going to forgive me this in a hurry!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Zip-sip, zip-zip, zip-zip, zip-zip, zip-zip, zip-zip, zip-zip. It was as quick as that, and even more blurred and breathless in both boots than in one. Sophie had brief glimpses between long double strides: of the mansion down at the end of the valley, gleaming between trees, with Fanny's carriage at the door; of bracken on a hillside; of a small river acing down into a green valley; of the same river sliding in a much broader valley; of the same valley turned so wide it seemed endless and blue in the distance, and a towery pile far, far off that might have been Kingsbury; of the plain narrowing toward mountains again; of a mountain which slanted so deeply under her boot that she stumbled in spite of her stick, which stumble brought her to the edge of a deep, blue-misted gorge, with the tops of trees far below, where she had to take another stride or fall in.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the flower shop she hauled the seven-league boots out of the window display and emptied hibiscus, roses, and water out of them onto the floor. She unlocked the shop door and towed the wet boots out onto the crowded pavement. "Excuse me," she said to various shoes and trailing sleeves that were walking in her way. She looked up at the sun, which was not easy to find in the cloudy gray sky. "Let's see. Southeast. That way. Excuse me, excuse me," she said, clearing a small space for the boots among the holiday-makers. She put them down pointing the right way. The she stepped into them and began to stride.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了花店，她把七里格靴由橱窗摆设拿下来，把里面的木槿、玫瑰和水一股脑地全倒在地上。她打开锁住的店门，将湿漉漉的靴子拖到拥挤的街道上。“对不起，”她对一堆挡到她的鞋子和垂袖说。她抬头望向太阳，在多云灰暗的天色中并不容易找到。“让我看看，东南方。是那边。好，对不起、对不起。”说着，在庆祝节日的人群中清出一小块地来放靴子。她将靴子的方血向对好，脚踩进去，然后开步走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She took another stride. The wind of it did not cool her down. The rocks and bushes were the same, but the sand was grayer, and the mountains seemed to have sunk down the sky. Sophie peered into the quivering gray glare ahead, where she thought she could see something rather higher than rock. She took one more stride.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她再跨一步，扬起的风一点也没能让她凉快，岩石与树丛看来仍是同一模样，但是沙的颜色变灰，而山似乎沉到天底。苏菲透过前方闪动的灰色强凝视，她觉得似乎看到比岩石高出许多的东西。她又跨了一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she landed in crumbly yellow sand. She dug her stick in and looked carefully round. Behind her right shoulder, some miles off, a white, steamy mist almost hid the mountains she had just zipped through. Below the mist was a band of dark green. Sophie nodded. Though she could not see the moving castle this far away, she was sure that mist marked the place of flowers. She took another careful stride. Zip. It was a fearsomely hot day. The clay-yellow sand stretched in all directions now, shimmering in the heat. Rocks lay about in a messy way. The only growing things were occasional dismal gray bushes. The mountains looked like clouds coming up on the horizon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她降落在碎碎的黄沙上。她将拐杖插进沙里，小心地四处探望。在她右肩后面，几哩远的地方，一片白色如蒸气的雾几乎掩没了她刚刚穿越的群山，雾霭下面是一条带状的深绿。苏菲点点硕，虽然隔这么远看不到城堡，但是她很确定雾霭处就是群花所在的地方。她小心地再跨一步。滋。温度热得可怕。黏土般的黄沙往各个方向延伸，在高温下微微发亮，岩石不规则地散落着，唯一生长的，是偶尔可见的可怕灰色树丛众山看起来彷佛是地平在线升起的云。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If this is the Waste," Sophie said, with sweat running in all her wrinkles, "then I feel sorry for the Witch having to live here."</div>

<div class="line_en">The thing seemed to be made of yellow-gray grit of the Waste. At first Sophie wondered if it might be some strange kind of ants' nest. But as she got neared, she could see that it was as if something had fused together thousands of grainy yellow flowerpots into a tapering heap. She grinned. The moving castle had often struck her as being remarkably like the inside of a chimney. This building was really a collection of chimney pots. It had to be a fire demon's work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这建筑物似乎是由荒地那些黄、灰色的砂砾所造成。起先，苏菲想说这会不会是一种奇怪的蚂蚁住的蚁丘？但是走近后，她才看到那是将数千个有粗砾的黄色花花盆黏在一起，成为一个顶端尖细的建筑。她忍不住微笑起来，她常觉得移动的城堡很像是烟囱的内部，而眼前这个建筑则很明显的是烟囱顶的集合体。这一定是出自火魔之手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Sophie panted up the rise, there was suddenly no doubt that this was the Witch's fortress. Two small orange figures came out of the dark space at the bottom and stood waiting for her. She recognized the Witch's two page boys. Hot and breathless as she was, she tried to speak to them politely, to show she had no quarrel wit them. "Good afternoon," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当苏菲喘着气往上走时，她突然再无任何怀疑，这确实是女巫的碉堡！两个小小的橘色身影由碉堡底下一个黑暗处走了出来，詀着等她，她认出那是女巫的两个侍童。虽然她又热又喘着气，还是试着礼貌地跟他们知道她跟他们无怨无仇。“午安。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it was like an oven. But there was a peculiar-shaped pile about a quarter of a mile off, standing on a slight rise in the rock-littered land. It was a fantastical shape of twisted towers, rising to one main tower that pointed slightly askew, like a knotty old finger. Sophie climbed out of the boots. It was too hot to carry anything so heavy, so she trudged off to investigate with only her stick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在温度简直像烤炉了，但是在前面四分之一哩处，有一个形状特别的堆状物，站在稍稍隆起的岩石地上。那是一栋形状奇特的城堡，一些形状扭曲的小塔拱着一座稍稍倾斜的主塔，像是多节的老人手指。苏菲把靴子脱掉，天气太热了，无法携带这么重的东西走路。她只在拄着拐杖，蹒跚地走去调查。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie shrugged and followed him inside. The other page walked after her. And of course the entrance vanished as soon as she was through. Sophie shrugged again. She would have to deal with that problem when she came back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲耸耸肩，随他走进去，另一个侍童则跟在她身后。当然，她一进门，入口就消失了。苏菲再度耸耸肩，这个问题等回程的时候再来伤脑筋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They just gave her sulky looks. One bowed and held out his hand, pointing toward the misshapen dark archway between the bent columns of chimney pots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们只是闷闷不乐地看着她，其中一位对她鞠躬，然后伸出手，指向烟囱顶造成的弯曲柱子间，一个造型不佳的黑暗拱门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length the pages led her to a sort of central den. Or maybe it was just a space between pillars. Sophie was confused by then. The fortress seemed enormous, though she suspected that it was deceptive, just as the castle was. The Witch was standing there waiting. Again, it was hard to tell how Sophie knew-except that it could be no one else. The Witch was hugely tall and skinny now and her hair was fair, in a ropelike pigtail over one bony shoulder. She wore a white dress. When Sophie walked straight up to her, brandishing her stick, the Witch backed away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，这两位侍童将她带到一个像是中央私室的地方，又或许，那只是位于一些柱子间的一块空间。苏菲已经有些搞胡涂了，这碉堡似乎很大，但她怀疑这跟移动的城堡一样，只是幻觉。女巫站在那里等她，很难说苏菲怎么会知道，但是，不可能有别人了不是吗？眼前的女巫看起来非常高瘦。头发是金色的，缠成发辫垂在瘦骨嶙峋的一边肩膀上。当苏菲手中挥舞着拐杖，对着她走过去时，她往后退。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She rearranged her lace shawl, straightened her draggled skirts, and walked forward. It was a little like going through the castle door with the knob black-down. There was a moment of nothingness, followed by murky light. The light came from greenish-yellow flames that burned and flickered all round, but in a shadowy way which gave no heat and very little light either. When Sophie looked at them, the flames were never where she looking, but always to the side. But that was the way of magic. Sophie shrugged again and followed the page this and way and that among skinny pillars of the same chimney-pot kind as the rest of the building.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把蕾丝披肩重新披好，拖得脏脏垮垮的裙子拉好，然后往前走。那感觉很像是城堡的门把黑色朝下时，走出城堡大门的感觉，有好一会儿的虚无，然后是朦胧的光。光来自四周燃烧、闪烁的绿黄色火焰，但这些火焰很阴暗，不散发出热量，亮度也非常低。当苏菲注视它们时，火焰绝不会在她目光所及处，一定是在旁边。魔法就是这样吧！苏菲再度耸耸肩，跟着那侍童在烟囱顶造成的细柱间穿梭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Witch backed away further, gesturing with both hands. And the page boys both melted into sticky orange blobs which rose into the air and flew toward Sophie. "Yucky! Get off!" Sophie cried, beating at them with her stick. The orange blobs did not seem to care for her stick. They dodged it, and wove about, and then darted behind Sophie. She was just thinking she had got the better of them when she found herself glued to a chimney-pot pillar by them. Orange sticky stuff stranded between her ankles when she tried to move and plucked at her hair quite painfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女巫又往后退，伸出双手做了个手势，两个侍童一起溶成两颗黏黏的橘色球体，升到空中，对着她飞过来。“好恶心，走开！”苏菲边叫边用拐杖打它们。橘色黏球似乎很不喜欢她的拐杖，闪躲着，四处穿梭，然后对着她的背后直飞过去。她才在想她打败它们了，却发现自己被它们黏在一根烟囱顶造成的柱子上。当她试着挣脱时，黏黏的橘色线状物质将她的足踝捆住，还用力扯她的头发，把她弄得很痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie began to fear that, as usual, she had made a mess of things. The sticky stuff seemed to be getting harder and harder and more elastic every second. When she tried to move, it snapped her back against the pottery pillar. "Where's Miss Angorian?" she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲开始担心她一如以往，又把事情搞砸了。那些黏黏的物质似乎越来越硬，越有弹性。当她试着移动时，它们就她弹回去紧靠在陶制的柱子上。“安歌丽雅小姐在哪里？”她问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It will," said the Witch, smiling slightly. "Now that you have fallen for our deception and come here. Howl will have to be honest for once." She made another gesture, toward the murky flames this time, and a sort of a throne trundled out from between two pillars and stopped in front of the Witch. There was a man sitting in it, wearing a green uniform and long, shiny boots. Sophie thought he was asleep at first, with his head out of sight sideways. But the Witch gestured again. The man sat up straight. And he had no head on his shoulders at all. Sophie realized she was looking at all that was left of Prince Justin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“会的。”女巫微微一笑：“既然妳中计跑到这里来，哈尔这次想不诚实也不行了。”她又做了一个手势，这次的对象是模糊的火光，一个像王座的东西由两根柱子间滚动出来，上面坐着一个男人，身穿绿色制服及光亮的长靴子。起先，苏菲以为他在睡觉，头侧靠在另一边所以她看不到。但是女巫再比了一个手势，那人就坐直了。他肩膀上面是空的，没有头。苏菲这下知道了，她眼前看到的是贾斯丁王子剩下的部分。">查看中文翻译</div>

It is waiting for Howl's head, to make it our perfect human. When we have Howl's head, we shall have the new King of Ingary, and I shall rule as Queen."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Witch did not like Sophie to wave her stick. She stepped backward. "I am very tired," she said. "You people keep spoiling my plans. First Wizard Suliman would not come near the Waste, so that I had to threaten Princess Valeria in order to make the king order him out here. Then, when he came, he grew trees. Then the King would not let Prince Justin follow Suliman for months, and when he did follow, the silly fool went up north somewhere for some reason, and I had to use all my arts to get him here. Howl had caused me even more trouble. He got away once. I've had to use a curse to bring him in, and while I was finding out enough about him to lay the curse, you got into what was left of Suliman's brain and caused me more trouble. And now when I bring you here, you wave your stick and argue. I have worked very hard for this moment, and I am not to be argued with." She turned away and wandered off into the murk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie stared after the tall white figure moving among the dim flames. I think her age has caught up with her! she thought. She's crazy! I must get loose and rescue Miss Angorian from her somehow! Remembering that the orange stuff had avoided her stick, just as the Witch had, Sophie reached back over her shoulders with her stick and wagged it back and forth where the sticky stuff met the pottery pillar. "Get out of it!" she said. "Let me go!" Her hair dragged painfully, but stringy orange bits began to fly away sideways. Sophie wagged the stick harder.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Witch gave a yowl of rage and rushed toward it with her fair pigtail flying and her bony arms stretched out. The scarecrow leaped at her. There was another violent bang and the two of them were wrapped in a magic cloud, like the cloud over Porthaven when Howl and the Witch had fought. The cloud battered this way and that, filling the dusty air with shrieks and booms. Sophie's hair frizzed. The cloud was only yards away, going this way and that among pottery pillars. And the break in the wall was quite near too. As Sophie had thought, the fortress was really not big. Every time the cloud moved across the blinding white gap, she could see through it, and see the two skinny figures battling in its midst. She stared, and kept wagging her stick behind her back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女巫气得尖叫，朝它扑过去，金色的辫子飞扬起来，两只骨瘦嶙峋的手臂直伸出去，稻草人也对她跳过去，又是一阵巨响！两个人笼罩在魔法的云雾当中，就像哈尔跟女巫战斗时，笼罩在避难港上空的那种云雾。云里看不见两个人的激烈缠斗，只听见灰尘飞扬的空气中充满尖叫声和轰隆声，苏菲的头发跟着滋滋作响。云不过在几呎之外，在陶制的柱子间移动，时东时西，墙上的破洞也离她很近。正如苏菲猜测，碉堡其实不大。每当云雾移过那令人目盲的白色洞口时，苏菲可以看透它，看到两个瘦瘦的形体在其间战斗，她边看边对着背后挥动拐扙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had worked her head and shoulders loose when there came a dull booming sound. The pale flames wavered and the pillar behind Sophie shook. Then, with a crash like a thousand tea sets falling downstairs, a piece of the fortress wall blew out. Light blinded in through a long, jagged hole, and a figure came leaping in through the opening. Sophie turned eagerly, hoping it was Howl. But the black outline had only one leg. It was the scarecrow again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的头和肩膀都松开时，突然传来一阵闷闷的隆隆声。苍白的火焰摇晃着，苏菲身后的柱子也一阵震动。然后轰然巨响，像一千套茶具同时摔下楼梯，碉堡的一部分被炸开。光线从一个长长的、锯齿状的缺口照射进来，令人目盲。一个身影由洞口跳进来，苏菲热切地转头去看，希望来的是哈尔，但是那个黑色轮廓显示的只有一条腿，来的是稻草人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was loose all except her legs when the cloud streamed across in front of the light one more time. Sophie saw another person leap through the gap behind it. This one had flying black sleeves. It was Howl. Sophie could see the outline of him clearly, standing with arms folded, watching the battle. For a moment it looked as if he was going to let the Witch and the scarecrow get on with it. Then the long sleeves flapped as Howl raised his arms. Above the screaming and booming, Howl's voice shouted one strange, long word, and a long roll of thunder came with it. The scarecrow and the Witch both jolted. Claps of sound rang round the pottery pillars, echo after echo, and each echo carried some of the cloud of magic away with it. It vanished in wisps and swirled away in murky eddies. When it had become the thinnest white haze, the tall figure with the pigtail began to totter. The Witch seemed to fold in on herself, thinner and whiter than ever. Finally, as the haze faded clean away, she fell in a heap with a small clatter. As the million soft echoes died, Howl and the scarecrow were left thoughtfully facing one another across a pile of bones.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, my friend," Howl said to the scarecrow. The scarecrow had hopped right among the bones and was pushing them this way and that with its leg. "No, you won't find her heart here. Her fire demon will have got that. I think it's had the upper hand of her for a long time now. Sad, really." As Sophie took off her shawl and arranged it decently across Prince Justin's headless shoulders, Howl said, "I think the rest of what you were looking for is over here."

<div class="line_en">Another thing happened as well. The moment Miss Angorian was gone, the scarecrow was no longer there either.
