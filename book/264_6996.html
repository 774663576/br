<div class="line_en">He was dressed all in dull grey. His head hung down, and he moved his feet as if they were made of lead. So sad was he that he did not see Little John and Much until they were close upon him. Then he tried to draw his bow and arrows to shoot at them, but they were too quick for him. Seizing him by the arms they led him before Robin Hood, who was sitting under his great oak-tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他浑身穿着暗灰色的衣服，耷拉着头，挪起腿来好像腿是用铅做的一样。他那么难过，一直到小约翰和马奇靠近他了才看见他们。然后，他企图拔出弓箭来射他们，但是相对于他来说，他俩动作太敏捷了。他们抓住他的胳膊，就把他带到正坐在他那棵大橡树下的罗宾汉面前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they walked along they met the very knight that Robin had seen the day before. But how different he looked! It was difficult to believe that he was the same man.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day when Robin was walking through the wood, he met a happy young knight. The knight was dressed in scarlet silk, and wore a hat with feathers. He held his head high and walked with a light and pleasant step. As he walked he sang a merry song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，罗宾在树林中走路的时候，遇见了一位年轻的骑士。这位骑士穿着大红色的丝绸衣服，戴着一顶插着羽毛的帽子。他头抬得很高，走起路来脚步轻盈而愉快。他边走边唱着快活的歌儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day Little John and Much, the tallest and the shortest of Robin Hood's band, went for a walk. It was very funny to see these two together. Little John was seven feet high and very straight and strong. Much was scarcely five and very broad and fat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Robin rose politely, bowed to him, and welcomed him to the Green Wood. Then still very politely (for being a real earl, Robin was always very polite to people, though he did rob them) he asked if the stranger had any money to spare for Robin Hood and his Merry Men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗宾客气地站起来，向他鞠了一躬，欢迎他到绿林中来。然后，他更客气地（罗宾作为一个名副其实的伯爵，虽然也抢劫，但他对人们总是非常客气）问这位陌生人是否能给罗宾汉和他的伙计们省出些钱来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Robin heard that the knight was so poor, he was very sorry for him, and asked him to sit down and tell him how that was, and why he was so sad. So with many a sigh the poor young man told his tale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗宾听说这个骑士这么穷，就非常同情他，叫他坐下来，告诉自己这是怎么回事，为什么他那么难过。于是，这个可怜的青年人叹了一口气，讲述了自己的经历。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My name is Allan-a-Dale," he said. "Seven years ago I fell in love with the most beautiful lady in all the world. She loved me too and we were very happy. But her father was very angry. I was poor, and he said we were too young to marry. He promised, however, that if we would wait seven years and a day we should then be married. The seven years are over, and yesterday should have been our wedding day. I went to ask the girl to marry me. But the old knight would scarcely speak to me. He said his daughter was not for such a poor man as I. Tomorrow she is to be married to another. He is old and ugly, but he has a great deal of money. So I have lost my love, and my heart is broken."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的名字叫阿伦—厄—戴尔，”他说。“7年前，我爱上了全世界最美丽的姑娘。她也爱我，我们都非常幸福，但他父亲却非常生气。我很穷，他说我们年龄太小了，不能结婚。然而，他答应说，如果我们愿意等7年零一天，我们就可以结婚了。7年结束了，昨天就应该是我们结婚的日子。我去向这位姑娘求婚，但是这位老骑士几乎不肯跟我说一句话。他说他的女儿不能嫁个像我这样的穷光蛋。明天，他就要嫁给另一个人了。他样子又老又丑，但是很有钱。所以，我失去了爱情，我的心都碎了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="罗宾听到这番话非常高兴。他拍了拍阿伦的肩膀，叫他高兴起来。“明天就是你举行婚礼的日子，”他说。然后，他问到举行婚礼的教堂有多远，阿伦告诉他说在戴尔修道院，只有5英里多一点那么远。">查看中文翻译</div>

He left orders with Little John that he was to follow with twenty-four good men all dressed in Lincoln green. Also he was to bring with him Friar Tuck and Allan-a-dale.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why," said Allan, "I have no gold. But if you bring my true love back to me, I swear to serve you faithfully forever. I cannot shoot so far or so straight as your good men, but I can make and sing sweet songs and play upon the harp."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎呀，”阿伦说，“我没有金子。但是如果你把我真正的情人带来，我发誓要永远为你忠实地效力。我射箭没有你的好汉那么远，那么直，但是我可以创作演唱甜美的歌儿，还能弹奏竖琴呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the bridegroom came. Silence fell upon the church as he entered. Nothing was heard except the ring of his gold-headed cane on the floor, as he came slowly up the passageway. So old and ugly he was. Older and uglier even than Robin had expected. He was dressed in a suit of white silk which helped to make him look more aged and thin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，新郎来了。他进来的时候，教堂静了下来。他慢慢从过道走来的时候，除了他那金头手杖在地板上发出的铃声外，其他什么声音也听不见。他甚至比起罗宾所料想的还要老，还要丑。他穿着一身白色丝绸衣服，这让他显得更加年迈消瘦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was so beautiful. With slow and fine steps she came, leaning on her father's arm. Her face was sad, her eyes looking down. Her face was pale. She came dressed in shining white silk. Round her white throat and in her golden hair, wonderful pearls shone in the dim light. If the bridegroom was more ugly than Robin had expected, the bride was far more beautiful. Behind her came the little choir boys, dressed in red and white, singing a sweet wedding song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她长得那么美丽。她扶着父亲的胳膊，迈着缓慢而轻柔的脚步走来了。她的表情非常忧伤，眼睛往下看着，脸色苍白。她穿着闪亮的白色绸缎进来了。她那白皙的脖子周围和金色的头发上，都有美丽的珍珠，在昏暗的光线中闪闪发光。如果说新郎比起罗宾所预料得更丑陋的话，新娘就美丽得多了。她的身后来了唱诗班的小男童，身穿红白相间的衣服，唱着优美的婚礼之歌。">查看中文翻译</div>
