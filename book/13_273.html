<div class="line_en">"Are you in pain, Frodo?" said Gandalf quietly as he rode by Frodo's side.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured," said Gandalf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉！有些伤口是永远治不好的。”甘道夫说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I fear it may be so with mine," said Frodo. "There is no real going back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想对我来说的确是这样，”佛罗多说：“已经没有退路了，虽然我可以回到夏尔，但一切都不一样了，因为我自己变了。我受过刀伤、毒刺、牙咬，承受过无比的重担，我能在哪里找到安息之所呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home. They were eager now to see the Shire again; but at first they rode only slowly, for Frodo had been ill at ease. When they came to the Ford of Bruinen, he had halted, and seemed loth to ride into the stream; and they noted that for a while his eyes appeared not to see them or things about him. All that day he was silent. It was the sixth of October.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，哈比人开始朝着故乡进发，他们急着想要再看到夏尔，并没有马上就开始赶路，因为佛罗多觉得有些不安。当他们来到布鲁南渡口时，他停了下来，似乎不太愿意渡河。他们注意到他的目光似乎有些涣散，那一整天他都沉默不语。这时是十月六日。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gandalf did not answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫没有回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and Frodo was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before. After that the journey went well, and the days went quickly by; for they rode at leisure, and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun. At length they came to Weathertop; and it was then drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road. Then Frodo begged them to hasten, and he would not look towards the hill, but rode through its shadow with head bowed and cloak drawn close about him. That night the weather changed, and a wind came from the West laden with rain, and it blew loud and chill, and the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air. When they came to the Chetwood already the boughs were almost bare, and a great curtain of rain veiled Bree-hill from their sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了第二天快结束时，那痛苦和不安都已经过去了，佛罗多又变得兴高采烈，彷佛根本不记得之前的黑暗过去。在那之后，旅程相当的顺利，日子过得很快。他们悠闲自在的骑着，在长满了金黄和红铜色树叶的森林里面流连。不久之后，他们来到了风云顶，时间渐近傍晚，路上显得相当黑暗。佛罗多恳求大家加快脚步，他刻意不想看向那山丘，只是低着头，裹紧披风往前冲。那天晚上，气候变了，西方吹来了夹杂着雨滴的风，这风又强又冷，金黄的树叶像是鸟儿一样在空中飞舞。当他们来到契特森林时，树叶几乎都掉光了，浓密的雨丝将布理丘包围了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, yes I am," said Frodo. "It is my shoulder. The wound aches, and the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today."</div>

<div class="line_en">When they had called many times, at last the Gate-keeper came out, and they saw that he carried a great cudgel. He looked at them with fear and suspicion; but when he saw that Gandalf was there, and that his companions were hobbits, in spite of their strange gear, then he brightened and wished them welcome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们大呼小叫了许久之后，守门人才走出来，他们注意到他拿着根大棒子。守门人惊疑地看着他们，但当他发现眼前穿着奇装异服的人是甘道夫和一群哈比人之后，还是满脸堆笑的让他们走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So it was that near the end of a wild and wet evening in the last days of October the five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the South-gate of Bree. It was locked fast; and the rain blew in their faces, and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by, and their hearts sank a little, for they had expected more welcome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这么一个潮湿的十月底，五名旅人在傍晚来到了布理的南门。门关得紧紧的，风雨吹在他们的脸上；天空的乌云卷动着，他们都觉得一颗心直往下沉，因为他们期待的是比这更热烈的欢迎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come in!" he said, unlocking the gate. "We won't stay for news out here in the cold and the wet, a ruffianly evening. But old Barley will no doubt give you a welcome at The Pony, and there you'll hear all there is to hear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“进来吧！”他边开门边说道：“在这种鬼天气，我们实在不可能一直待在外面。老巴力曼应该可以在跃马旅店好好欢迎你们，你们应该可以从他那边知道不少消息。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh have they? I'll learn them," came Butterbur's voice, and out he came with a rush, and he had a club in his hand. But when he saw who they were he stopped short, and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，是吗？让我给他们一点教训！”奶油伯的声音接着说，然后他就拿着棒子冲了出来。但是，当他看清楚眼前的人时，他猛地停了下来，恶狠狠的表情瞬间变成欢欣鼓舞的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good evening to you!" they said, and passed through; and then they noticed that behind the hedge at the roadside a long low hut had been built, and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the fence. When they came to Bill Ferny's house they saw that the hedge there was tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也晚安哪！”他们边打招呼，边走进门内。此时，他们注意到围篱之后的路旁建了许多栋低矮的房子，许多人从里头走了出来瞪着他们。当他们来到比尔—羊齿蕨的屋子前，他们注意到院子里一团乱，所有的窗户都用木板钉了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

And where have you come from? I never expected to see any of you folk again, and that's a fact: going off into the Wild with that Strider, and all those Black Men about. But I'm right glad to see you, and none more than Gandalf. Come in! Come in! The same rooms as before? They're free. Indeed most rooms are empty these days, as I'll not hide from you, for you'll find it out soon enough. And I'll see what can be done about supper, as soon as may be; but I'm short-handed at present. Hey, Nob you slowcoach! Tell Bob! Ah, but there I'm forgetting, Bob's gone: goes home to his folk at nightfall now. Well, take the guests" ponies to the stables, Nob! And you'll be taking your horse to his stable yourself, Gandalf, I don't doubt. A fine beast, as I said when I first set eyes on him. Well, come in! Make yourselves at home!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Butterbur had at any rate not changed his manner of talking, and still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle. And yet there was hardly anybody about, and all was quiet; from the Common Room there came a low murmur of no more than two or three voices. And seen closer in the light of two candles that he lit and carried before them the landlord's face looked rather wrinkled and careworn.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们也正准备这样做，”甘道夫说：“我们并不累，我们很轻松。虽然我们之前又湿、又冷又饿，但这都已经被你治好了。来吧，坐下来！如果你还有烟叶，我们会很感谢你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They put him in a large chair by the wood-fire, and Gandalf sat on the other side of the hearth, and the hobbits in low chairs between them; and then they talked for many times half an hour, and exchanged all such news as Mr. Butterbur wished to hear or give. Most of the things which they had to tell were a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host, and far beyond his vision; and they brought forth few comments other than: "You don't say," often repeated in defiance of the evidence of Mr. Butterbur's own ears. "You don't say, Mr. Baggins, or is it Mr. Underhill? I'm getting so mixed up. You don't say, Master Gandalf! Well I never! Who'd have thought it in our times!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们让他在炉火旁的一张大椅子上坐了下来，甘道夫坐在对面，哈比人则是坐在之间的矮凳上，他们交谈的时间远远超过半个小时，也和奶油伯交换了不少消息。他们所说的事情几乎每件都让主人大吃一惊，他根本连想像都无法想像。因此，奶油伯口中只有这几句话翻来覆去的说：“我不敢相信”的次数，多到连奶油伯自己都开始怀疑自己的听力。“巴金斯先生，我不敢相信哪！还是应该叫你山下先生？我都搞混了。甘道夫先生，我不敢相信哪！天哪！真难想像！谁想得到呀…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two, a wad of uncut leaf. "Southlinch," he said, "and the best we have; but not the match of Southfarthing, as I've always said, though I'm all for Bree in most matters, begging your pardon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他回来的时候，他拿了一些够他们用两三天的份量，那是没有修剪过的叶子。“南方叶，这是我们手头最好的，但就像我常说的一样，这还是比不上夏尔南区的上等叶。虽然我大多时候都护着布理，但这点真的不得不承认。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, if you'd called for anything else, I'd have been happier," said Butterbur. "That's just a thing that we're short of, seeing how we've only got what we grow ourselves, and that's not enough. There's none to be had from the Shire these days. But I'll do what I can."</div>

And Harry Goatleaf that used to be on the West-gate, and that Bill Ferny, they came in on the strangers' side, and they've gone off with them; and it's my belief they let them in. On the night of the fight, I mean.

<div class="line_en">But he did say much on his own account. Things were far from well, he would say. Business was not even fair, it was downright bad. "No one comes nigh Bree now from Outside," he said. "And the inside folks, they stay at home mostly and keep their doors barred. It all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that began coming up the Greenway last year, as you may remember; but more came later. Some were just poor bodies running away from trouble; but most were bad men, full o' thievery and mischief. And there was trouble right here in Bree, bad trouble. Why, we had a real set-to, and there were some folk killed, killed dead! If you'll believe me."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，各位先生们，幸好你们没有遇到，”奶油伯说：“也难怪他们不敢打你们的主意，他们可不敢对全副武装的人动粗，那些带着宝剑、盾牌和头盔的家伙，这会让他们在动手之前三思的。当我看到你们的时候，我真的吓了一跳。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them with amazement not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their gear. They themselves had become so used to warfare and to riding in well-arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that the bright mail peeping from under their cloaks, and the helms of Gondor and the Mark, and the fair devices on their shields, would seem outlandish in their own country. And Gandalf, too, was now riding on his tall grey horse, all clad in white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all, and the long sword Glamdring at his side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人这才意识到在他们回来之后，每个人都用着惊讶好奇的眼光看着他们。他们自己早已惯于骑马作战，或是和战士们斯混在一起，对于自己斗篷底下的盔甲，刚铎、骠骑的头盔、盾牌浑然不觉得奇怪，但是，这样的情景出现在宁静的小村庄就显得格格不入了。甘道夫骑着高大的灰马，浑身雪白，披着银色和蓝色的披风，腰间还挂着格兰瑞神剑，看起来更是奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>

For there's been worse than robbers about. Wolves were howling round the fences last winter. And there's dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that it makes the blood run cold to think of. It's been very disturbing, if you understand me."</div>

The Bree folk were all out to see them off, and were in merrier mood than they had been for a year; and those who had not seen the strangers in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them: at Gandalf with his white beard, and the light that seemed to gleam from him, as if his blue mantle was only a cloud over sunshine; and at the four hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales.
