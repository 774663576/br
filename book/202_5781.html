<div class="line_en">He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty-four hours ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left him… Dumbledore…</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione's slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron's. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利第二天清晨醒来，裹着睡袋躺在客厅地板上。厚厚的窗帘间漏出一线天空，像冲淡的蓝墨水一般凉爽清澈，是那种介于夜晚与黎明之间的颜色。周围静悄悄的，只听到罗恩和赫敏缓慢深长的呼吸。哈利望着他们投在他身边地板上的影子。罗恩昨晚一时大显绅士风度，坚持让赫敏睡在沙发垫子上，所以她的侧影比罗恩的高，她的胳膊弯着搭在地板上，手指距离罗恩的只有几英寸。哈利猜测他们或许是手拉手睡着的，这想法让他感到莫名的孤独。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore's death felt different now. The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多死后一直笼罩在他心头的那种悲伤现在感觉不同了。婚礼上穆丽尔姨婆的非议仿佛病菌寄生在他脑子里，侵蚀着他原来心目中的偶像。邓布利多会让那种事发生吗？他会像达力那样，只要不影响到自己，就对冷落和虐待袖手旁观吗？他会遗弃一个被禁闭、被隐藏的亲妹妹吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry thought of Godric's Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore's will, and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn't Dumbledore told him? Why hadn't he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利又想到戈德里克山谷，想到邓布利多从没提过的坟墓，想到邓布利多遗嘱中那些未加解释的神秘赠物。怨恨在黑暗中翻涌。邓布利多为什么不告诉他？为什么没有解释？邓布利多真正关心哈利吗？还是只把哈利当成一个需要磨砺的工具，但不信任他，从来不会向他倾吐秘密？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bag, picked up his wand, and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, "Lumos," and started to climb the stairs by wandlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利再也无法忍受躺在那里，只有怨恨的念头相伴。必须找点事情做，分分心。他钻出睡袋，拾起自己的魔杖，蹑手蹑脚地走出房间。到了楼梯口，他悄悄说了声“荧光闪烁”，用魔杖照着上楼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had never entered his godfather's bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利继续往楼上爬，一直爬到最高层楼梯口，那里只有两扇门，正对着他的那扇上面有块牌子写着小天狼星。哈利以前从未进过他教父的卧室，他推开门，高举魔杖，尽量照得远一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died? Harry's gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius's great-great-grandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster's study at Hogwarts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二个楼梯口是他和罗恩上次住过的那间卧室，他往里看了一眼，衣柜敞着，床单也拉开了。哈利想起楼下翻倒的巨怪断腿。凤凰社离开后有人搜查过这个房间。是斯内普吗？要么是蒙顿格斯？那家伙在小天狼星生前和死后从这所宅子里偷走了许多东西。哈利的目光移到那幅有时看到菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯·布莱克的肖像上面，然而此时画框中空空荡荡，只有一片浑浊的背景。小天狼星的这位高祖显然是在霍格沃茨的校长书房里过夜了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains, and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle stubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed's headboard; a spider's web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into the room, he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里很宽敞，以前肯定是相当漂亮的。有一张床头雕花的大床，高窗上遮着长长的天鹅绒帷幔，枝形吊灯上积着厚厚的灰尘，蜡烛头还留在插座里，凝固的烛泪像冰晶一样滴垂着。墙上的图画和床头板上也蒙着一层薄灰，一张蜘蛛网从枝形吊灯拉到木制的大衣橱顶部。哈利往屋子中间走时，听到有老鼠逃窜的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father; his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry's, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius's right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James's left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included… or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的心欢跳起来，他认出了自己的父亲，不服帖的黑发像哈利的一样在脑后支棱着，而且也戴着眼镜。他旁边是小天狼星，英俊而洒脱不羁，稍带高傲的面庞比哈利见过的任何时候都更加年轻快乐。小天狼星的右边是小矮星，比他矮一个头还多，胖乎乎的，眼睛湿润，为自己能加入这最酷的一群，与詹姆和小天狼星这样的受人钦佩的叛逆者结交而兴奋不已。詹姆的左边是卢平，甚至那时候也显得有一点邋遢，但他也带着那种惊讶而快乐的神情，发现自己被喜欢，被接纳……是否只是因为哈利知道了内情，才会在照片中看出这些东西？他想把它从墙上摘下来，反正这照片是他的了——小天狼星把一切都留给了他。可是他拿不下来，小天狼星为了不让自己的父母改变这间屋子的装饰，真是不遗余力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls' silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius's parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall, because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son's taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold, just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius's nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls, which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="少年小天狼星在墙上贴了这么多的招贴画和照片，原来银灰色的缎面墙壁几乎都看不到了。哈利只能猜测小天狼星的父母无法消除墙上的永久粘贴咒，因为他相信他们不会欣赏大儿子的装饰品位。小天狼星似乎有意要惹父母生气，屋里有几面大大的格兰芬多旗帜，强调他与这个斯莱特林家族中的其他人不同，金红的旗子已经褪色。还有许多麻瓜摩托车的图片，甚至有几张身着比基尼的麻瓜女孩招贴画（哈利不得不佩服小天狼星的勇气）。之所以看出是麻瓜女孩，是因为他们在画上一动不动，褪色的笑容和凝固在纸上的目光，与墙上惟一的一张巫师照片形成对比，那是四个霍格沃茨学生挽着手臂站在一起，冲着镜头在呵呵笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brighter: A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius's bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with their covers, and sundry pages littered the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利扫视地面，外面天色亮了起来，一道光线照出地毯上凌乱的纸片、书籍和小物品。显然小天狼星的卧室也被搜过了，不过里面的东西似乎大都被认为无用——或全部无用。有几本书被粗暴地抖过，封皮都掉了，书页散落在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thank you, thank you, for Harry's birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself, I'm enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground, but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought it was so funny, says he's going to be a great Quidditch player, but we've had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don't take our eyes off him when he gets going.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢谢你，谢谢你送给哈利的生日礼物！这是他最喜欢的玩具了。才一岁就已经能骑着玩具扫帚飞来飞去，他看上去好开心哪。我附上一张照片给你看看。你知道小扫帚只能离地两英尺，但哈利差点撞死了小猫，还差点打碎了一只难看的花瓶，那是佩妮送给我的圣诞礼物（不是抱怨）。当然，詹姆觉得非常好玩，说这孩子会成为下一个魁地奇明星，但我们不得不把所有的装饰品都收起来，并且在他飞的时候一直看着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He recognized one as part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out.</div>

We were so sorry you couldn't come, but the Order's got to come first, and Harry's not old enough to know it's his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell -- also, Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here last weekend, I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I CRIed all evening when I heard.</div>

When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had desCRIbed in her letter.

<div class="line_en">After another quarter of an hour, however, he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mother's letter was gone.

<div class="line_en">They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus's bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius's, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, Toujours Pur. Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them.</div>

<div class="line_en">A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph; a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been.</div>

The drawers' contents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer.</div>

The only thing there was an old copy of Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them.

<div class="line_en">"I forbid you to call anyone "blood traitor" or "Mudblood," " growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我禁止你叫任何人‘败类’或是‘泥巴种’。”哈利吼道，就算这家养小精灵没有把小天狼星出卖给伏地魔，他也会觉得克利切那长长的鼻子和充血的眼睛极不可爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a moment's silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, "Yes."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是，主人。”克利切说，又低低地鞠了一躬。哈利看到他的嘴唇在无声地蠕动，无疑是在默念现在禁止他说的侮辱性的话语。">查看中文翻译</div>

Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his Mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Harry, Kreacher doesn't think like that," said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. "He's a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn't that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He's loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you're going to say," she went on as Harry began to protest, "that Regulus changed his mind… but he doesn't seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus's family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，克利切不是那么想的，”赫敏用手背擦着眼睛说，“他是个奴隶，家养小精灵受惯了粗鲁的，甚至残暴的待遇。伏地魔对克利切做的事情并不那么罕见。巫师间的战争对克利切这样的小精灵有什么意义呢？他只是忠于对他好的人，布莱克夫人想必是如此，雷古勒斯当然也是，所以他心甘情愿为他们效命，并完全接受了他们的信仰。我知道你要说什么，”哈利正待争辩，她已经说道，“雷古勒斯思想转变了……但他似乎并未向克利切解释，是不是？我想我知道为什么。保持纯血统的老观念，克利切和雷古勒斯的家人都会更安全，雷古勒斯是想保护他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears flowed down Hermione's cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreacher's, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying to clear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克利切泣不成声，赫敏望着克利切，也泪流满面，可是不敢再碰他。就连对克利切毫无好感的罗恩也显得有些不安。哈利跪坐起来，甩甩头，想让脑子清楚一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't understand you, Kreacher," he said finally. "Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我搞不懂你，克利切，”他开口道，“伏地魔想害死你，雷古勒斯又为打败伏地魔而死，可你却甘愿把小天狼星出卖给伏地魔？甘愿到纳西莎和贝拉特里克斯那里，给伏地魔通风报信……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius's death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human's…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利无言反驳，看着克利切躺在地上哭泣，他想起邓布利多在小天狼星刚刚去世几小时后说的话：我认为小天狼星从没把克利切看作是跟人类拥有同样敏感情绪的一种生物……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it's no good looking like that, you know it's true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I'm sure "Miss Cissy" and "Miss Bella" were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know. I've said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did… and so did Sirius."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小天狼星对克利切态度很恶劣，哈利。那样看着我也没有用，你知道这是事实。小天狼星住到这里来时，克利切已经独自生活了很长时间，他也许正渴望一点温情，我相信‘西茜小姐’和‘贝拉小姐’对克利切相当亲切，于是他便愿意帮忙，说出了她们想知道的一切。我一直说巫师要为他们对待家养小精灵的方式付出代价，看，伏地魔付出了代价……还有小天狼星。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Kreacher," said Harry after a while, "when you feel up to it, er… please sit up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“克利切，”过了一会儿哈利说道，“当你觉得可以的时候，嗯……请坐起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something," said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“克利切，我要请你做一件事。”哈利说，望了望赫敏，希望得到支持。他想把命令说得和蔼些，但又不能假装这不是个命令。不过，他语气的变化似乎赢得了她的赞成，她鼓励地微笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好几分钟后，克利切才打着嗝安静下来。他撑着坐了起来，像小孩子似的用拳头揉着眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid's purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克利切点点头，爬了起来。哈利灵机一动，掏出海格送的皮袋子，取出那个假魂器，那个冒牌的挂坠盒，里面有雷古勒斯给伏地魔的字条。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Overkill, mate," said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“过头了，伙计。”罗恩说，小精灵一看到挂坠盒，发出一声又是吃惊又是痛苦的号叫，再次瘫倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where the locket -- where Master Regulus's locket is. It's really important. We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to -- er -- ensure that he didn't die in vain."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Kreacher, I'd, er, like you to have this," he said, pressing the locket into the elf 's hand. "This belonged to Regulus and I'm sure he'd want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you --"</div>

<div class="line_en">It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione's direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们花了将近半个小时才使克利切平静下来，自己竟能得到一件布莱克家族的遗物，小精灵激动得膝盖发软，站都站不住了。当他终于能蹒跚几步时，他们陪他走到碗柜前，看着他把挂坠盒仔细地藏在脏毯子里，并向他保证说，他离开期间他们一定会好好保护它。小精灵分别向哈利和罗恩低低地鞠了一躬，甚至朝赫敏滑稽地抽搐了一下，也许是试图行一个礼，随后便在熟悉的啪的一声中幻影移形了。">查看中文翻译</div>
