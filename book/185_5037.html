<div class="line_en">At first Shasta could see nothing in the valley below him but a sea of mist with a few domes and pinnacles rising from it; but as the light increased and the mist cleared away he saw more and more. A broad river divided itself into two streams and on the island between them stood the city of Tashbaan, one of the wonders of the world. Round the very edge of the island, so that the water lapped against the stone, ran high walls strengthened with so many towers that he soon gave up trying to count them. Inside the walls the island rose in a hill and every bit of that hill, up to the Tisroc's palace and the great temple of Tash at the top, was completely covered with buildings -- terrace above terrace, street above street, zigzag roads or huge flights of steps bordered with orange trees and lemon trees, roofgardens, balconies, deep archways, pillared colonnades, spires, battlements, minarets, pinnacles. And when at last the sun rose out of the sea and the great silver-plated dome of the temple flashed back its light, he was almost dazzled.</div>

<div class="line_en">The river banks on each side of the valley were such a mass of gardens that they looked at first like forest, until you got closer and saw the white walls of innumerable houses peeping out from beneath the trees. Soon after that, Shasta noticed a delicious smell of flowers and fruit. About fifteen minutes later they were down among them, plodding on a level road with white walls on each side and trees bending over the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山谷两边河岸上花园那么多，乍看简直就像个森林，直至走近了，看到树木下露出无数房屋的雪白墙垣，才明白了真相。不久以后，沙斯塔便觉得有阵阵芬芳的花果香气。大约十五分钟以后他们便到了花园之间，他们走在一条平坦的道路上，两边都是雪白的墙垣，下垂的花木枝条伸出墙来。">查看中文翻译</div>

The water danced brightly in the early sunlight; away to the right nearer the river's mouth, they caught a glimpse ships' masts. Several other travellers were before them on the bridge, mostly peasants driving laden donkeys and mules or carrying baskets on their heads. The children and horses joined the crowd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们是到了。他们来到了河边，他们前面的道路循着座多孔大桥延伸过去。河水在早晨的阳光里明晃晃地奔腾跳跃，在右边远处靠近河口的地方，他们望见一些帆船桅杆的影踪。有几个旅客在他们前边的大桥上，大部分都是农民，赶着驮运货物的驴子和骡子，再不然就是脑袋上顶着篮子。孩子们和马儿们便混到这伙人中去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh it's all very well for you," whispered Aravis rather savagely. "What would you care about Tashbaan? But I ought to be riding in on a litter with soldiers before me and slaves behind, and perhaps going to a feast in the Tisroc's palace (may he live for ever) -- not sneaking in like this. It's different for you."</div>

<div class="line_en">At the far end of the bridge the walls of the city towered high above them and the brazen gates stood open in the gateway which was really wide but looked narrow because it was so very high. Half a dozen soldiers, leaning on their spears, stood on each side. Aravis couldn't help thinking, "They'd all jump to attention and salute me if they knew whose daughter I am." But the others were only thinking of how they'd get through and hoping the soldiers would not ask any questions. Fortunately they did not. But one of them picked a carrot out of a peasant's basket and threw it at Shasta with a rough laugh, saying:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大桥另一头的桥堍上，高高矗立着城墙，城门洞里的黄铜城门打开着，城门洞确实很大很阔，但冈为它很高，倒显得狭窄了。六个十兵，倚若长矛，站在城门洞的两边。阿拉维斯心中禁不住想道“如果他们知道我是谁的女儿，他们大家会跳起来立正，向我敬礼呢。”但其他的人马只是想着他们怎样穿过城门，并且希望士兵们不会盘问什么问题。幸亏士兵们并不盘问。但有一个士兵从农民的篮子里拿起一根胡萝卜，粗鲁地哈哈大笑着掷到了沙斯塔身上，他说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This frightened him badly for of course it showed that no one who knew anything about horses would mistake Bree for anything but a charger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事吓得他够呛，因为它当然表明了点：稍微懂得点儿马的人，是决不会把布里错当做其他什么乌，竟认不出它是匹战马的！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's my master's orders, so there!" said Shasta. But it would have been better if he had held his tongue for the soldier gave him a box on the side of his face that nearly knocked him down and said, "Take that, you young filth, to teach you how to talk to freemen." But they all slunk into the city without being stopped. Shasta cried only a very little; he was used to hard knocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我主人吩咐我这么办的，就是这么回事！”沙斯塔说。如果他闭口不说话，反倒好得多，因为那士兵在他的一边脸上给了他重重的一拳，几乎把他打下马来。“肮脏的小子，挨这一拳吧，教训教训你该怎样同自由人说话”但他们大家都溜进了城去，未受阻拦。沙斯塔只哭了一会儿，他对于挨揍已经习以为常了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside the gates Tashbaan did not at first seem so splendid as it had looked from a distance. The first street was narrow and there were hardly any windows in the walls on each side. It was much more crowded than Shasta had expected: crowded partly by the peasants (on their way to market) who had come in with them, but also with watersellers, sweetmeat sellers, porters, soldiers, beggars, ragged children, hens, stray dogs, and bare-footed slaves. What you would chiefly have noticed if you had been there was the smells, which came from unwashed people, unwashed dogs, scent, garlic, onions, and the piles of refuse which lay everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进了城门，塔什班就仿佛不像最初远远望去时那么富丽堂皇了。第条街是狭狭的，两边的墙上也没有什么窗子。街上远比沙斯塔想像的要拥挤得多，部分是由于挤满了跟他们一起进城、要到市场上去的农民，也由于到处是卖水的人、卖甜食的人、脚夫、士兵、乞丐、衣衫褴褛的儿童、母鸡、谜失的狗、赤脚的奴隶。如果你在那街上待过就知道，主要引起你注意的是那种乌七八糟的气味，它们来自没有洗过澡的人们、没有洗过澡的狗儿、牲畜的遗臭、大蒜、洋葱以及堆得到处都是的垃圾“">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shasta was pretending to lead but it was really Bree, who knew the way and kept guiding him by little nudges with his nose. They soon turned to the left and began going up a steep hill. It was much fresher and pleasanter, for the road was bordered by trees and there were houses only on the right side; on the other they looked out over the roofs of houses in the lower town and could see some way up the river. Then they went round a hairpin bend to their right and continued rising. They were zigzagging up to the centre of Tashbaan. Soon they came to finer streets. Great statues of the gods and heroes of Calormen -- who are mostly impressive rather than agreeable to look at -- rose on shining pedestals. Palm trees and pillared arcades cast shadows over the burning pavements. And through the arched gateways of many a palace Shasta caught sight of green branches, cool fountains, and smooth lawns. It must be nice inside, he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔假装在带路，其实直是由布早悄悄挪动鼻子来引导他的，布里才是认识道路的。他们不久就向左转弯，开始走上个陡峭的小山。这儿空气新鲜得多，也赏心悦目得多，因为大路两边种着树木，只有右边盖着房子；左边儿，他们的目光越过下边城镇的屋顶，能够望到河流的上游。接着，他们向右转了个U字形急弯，继续登山。他们正在曲曲折折地往上走向塔什班城的中心区。不久他们便踏上了较好的街道。神祗和卡乐门英雄的巨大雕像耸立在闪闪发光的基座上，大部分看起来令人印象深刻，却并不怎么悦人。棕榈树和圆柱连环拱廊的阴影投在发烫的人行道上。穿过许多王宫的拱形大门，沙斯塔看见苍翠的树枝、清凉的泉水和柔软的草坪。里边儿必定舒适漂亮极了，他想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At every turn Shasta hoped they were getting out of the crowd, but they never did. This made their progress very slow, and every now and then they had to stop altogether. This usually happened because a loud voice shouted out "Way, way, way, for the Tarkaan", or "for the Tarkheena", or "for the fifteenth Vizier", "or for the Ambassador", and everyone in the crowd would crush back against the walls; and above their heads Shasta would sometimes see the great lord or lady for whom all the fuss was being made, lolling upon a litter which four or even six gigantic slaves carried on their bare shoulders. For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which is that everyone who is less important has to get out of the way for everyone who is more important; unless you want a cut from a whip or punch from the butt end of a spear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次拐弯，沙斯塔都希望他们正在从拥挤的人群中走出去，但他们总是挤不出去。这就使他们的速度很慢，时不时还得停下步来。这种停顿往往是由于有个响亮的声音在喊道“闪开，闪开，闪开，给泰坎让路”，或是“给泰克希娜让路”，或是“给第十五代大臣让路”，或是“给大使让路”，于是人群中的每一个人都给逼到了墙脚边沙斯塔的目光越过人群的脑袋，有时看到大王爷或夫人懒洋洋地坐在轿子里，由四个甚或六个魁梧的奴隶抬在赤裸裸的肩膀上走过。因为在塔什班城，只有条交通规则，即：每个身份不及对方高贵的人，必须给对方让路，除非你想挨一下鞭子，或是被长矛柄戳下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shasta tried to get out of the way and to make Bree go back. But no horse, not even a Talking Horse from Narnia, backs easily. And a woman with a very edgy basket in her hands, who was just behind Shasta, pushed the basket hard against his shoulders, and said, "Now then! Who are you shoving!" And then someone else jostled him from the side and in the confusion of the moment he lost hold of Bree. And then the whole crowd behind him became so stiffened and packed tight that he couldn't move at all. So he found himself, unintentionally, in the first row and had a fine sight of the party that was coming down the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔想让开，叫布里退同去。但不论哪一匹马，哪怕是纳尼亚来的会说话的马，耍退回去可不容易。一个妇人手里拿着只尖角的篮子，正好站在沙斯塔的后面，把篮子死劲儿推到沙斯塔的肩膀上，说道：“喂你在推谁啊”接着又有人从旁边向他挤将过来，他在混乱中时撒手放开了布里。随后他背后的整个人群紧密地挤成一团，硬如磐石，弄得他压根儿无法挪动了。他终于发觉自己不由自主地给推到了最前列，清楚地看得见正从大街上走过来的那群人物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was quite unlike any other party they had seen that day. The crier who went before it shouting "Way, way!" was the only Calormene in it. And there was no litter; everyone was on foot. There were about half a dozen men and Shasta had never seen anyone like them before. For one thing, they were all as fair-skinned as himself, and most of them had fair hair. And they were not dressed like men of Calormen. Most of them had legs bare to the kneee. Their tunics were of fine, bright, hardy colours -- woodland green, or gay yellow, or fresh blue. Instead of turbans they wore steel or silver caps, some of them set with jewels, and one with little wings on each side of it. A few were bare-headed. The swords at their sides were long and straight, not curved like Calormene scimitars. And instead of being grave and mysterious like most Calormenes, they walked with a swing and let their arms and shoulders free, and chatted and laughed. One was whistling. You could see that they were ready to be friends with anyone who was friendly and didn't give a fig for anyone who wasn't. Shasta thought he had never seen anything so lovely in his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这群人物可跟他们那天见到的其他人马截然不同。在前边喊着“闪开，闪开”的是其中惟一的卡乐门人。没有轿子，人人都在徒步行走。他们总共有五六个人，沙斯塔以前从来没有见过任何人跟他们相像的。第一，他们都像他一样皮肤雪白，而且大部分都是金色头发。他们也穿得不像卡乐门人。他们大多数膝盖以下都是光着的。他们的束腰外衣的色彩都是美丽、明亮、耐久的——或是林地的青翠，或是怡人的嫩黄，或足鲜明的蔚蓝。他们不褰头巾，却戴上钢帽或银帽，有些帽了还镶嵌着珠宝，讣有一顶帽子均边缀着小翅膀。少数人光着脑袋不戴帽子。他们佩在腰问的剑长长的笔直的，并不像卡乐门弯刀。他们也不像大部分卡乐门人那样庄严神秘，走路摇摇摆摆，双肩放松自在，且谈且笑。有个人还吹着口哨。你看得出来，他们准备同任何友好的人做朋友，对任何不友好的人也毫不介意。沙斯塔觉得他生平从没有见过这样可爱的场面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course his first impulse was to say that he was only poor Arsheesh the fisherman's son and that the foreign lord must have mistaken him for someone else. But then, the very last thing he wanted to do in that crowded place was to start explaining who he was and what he was doing. If he started on that, he would soon be asked where he had got his horse from, and who Aravis was -- and then, goodbye to any chance of getting through Tashbaan. His next impulse was to look at Bree for help. But Bree had no intention of letting all the crowd know that he could talk, and stood looking just as stupid as a horse can. As for Aravis, Shasta did not even dare to look at her for fear of drawing attention. And there was no time to think, for the leader of the Narnians said at once:</div>

<div class="line_en">And so, before they were half-way through Tashbaan, all their plans were ruined, and without even a chance to say good-bye to the others Shasta found himself being marched off among strangers and quite unable to guess what might be going to happen next. The Narnian King -- for Shasta began to see by the way the rest spoke to him that he must be a king -- kept on asking him questions; where he had been, how he had got out, what he had done with his clothes, and didn't he know that he had been very naughty. Only the king called it "naught" instead of naughty.</div>

<div class="line_en">The strangers led him-held tightly by both hands-along a narrow street and down a flight of shallow stairs and then up another to a wide doorway in a white wall with two tall, dark cypress trees, one on each side of it. Once through the arch, Shasta found himself in a courtyard which was also a garden. A marble basin of clear water in the centre was kept continually rippling by the fountain that fell into it. Orange trees grew round it out of smooth grass, and the four white walls which surrounded the lawn were covered with climbing roses. The noise and dust and crowding of the streets seemed suddenly fad away. He was led rapidly across the garden and then into a dark doorway. The crier remained outside. After that they took him along a corridor, where the stone floor felt beautifully cool to his hot feet, and up some stairs. A moment later he found himself blinking in the light of a big, airy room with wide open windows, all looking North so that no sun came in. There was a carpet on the floor more wonderfully coloured than anything he had ever seen and his feet sank down into it as if he were treading in thick moss. All round the walls there were low sofas with rich cushions on them, and the room seemed to be full of people; very queer people some of them, thought Shasta. But he had no time to think of that before the most beautiful lady he had ever seen rose from her place and threw her arms round him and kissed him, saying:</div>

<div class="line_en">"Apparently," thought Shasta to himself, "I'm being mistaken for a prince of Archenland, wherever that is. And these must be the Narnians. I wonder where the real Corin is?" But these thoughts did not help him say anything out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“显而易见，”沙斯塔心中想道，“我被误认为阿钦兰的一个王子了，不论阿钦兰是在哪儿。这些人必定是纳尼亚人。我不知道那真正的科林在什么地方。”但这些想法也不能帮他大声作出任何回答来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your Majesties! Queen Susan! King Edmund!" said a voice: and when Shasta turned to look at the speaker he nearly jumped out of his skin with surprise. For this was one of these queer people whom he had noticed out of the corner of his eye when he first came into the room. He was about the same height as Shasta himself. From the waist upwards he was like a man, but his legs were hairy like a goat's, and shaped like a goat's and he had goat's hooves and a tail. His skin was rather red and he had curly hair and a short pointed beard and two little horns. He was in fact a Faun, which is a creature Shasta had never seen a picture of or even heard of. And if you've read a book called The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe you may like to know that this was the very same Faun, Tumnus by name, whom Queen Susan's sister Lucy had met on the very first day when she found her way into Narnia. But he was a good deal older now for by this time Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy had been Kings and Queens of Narnia for several years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“国王陛下！女王苏珊！国王爱德蒙！”有个声音说道；沙斯塔转过身来看那说话的人时，诧异得心惊肉跳。因为说这话的人，便是他刚走进房间时从眼角里瞅见的那些古怪人物之。他跟沙斯塔一般儿高，腰部以上像个人，但腿上多毛，像只羊，他还长着羊蹄和一条羊尾巴。他的皮肤相当红，他生着拳曲的头发，一把短而尖的胡子，两只羊角。事实上他是个羊怪，沙斯塔从未见过这样一个家伙的画像，甚至听也没听人讲起过。如果你读过本书，叫做《狮子、女巫和魔衣柜》，你倒会高兴地知道他就是那个叫图姆纳斯的羊怪，女王苏珊的妹妹露茜找到途径进入纳尼亚王国时，第一天碰到的就是他。不过，现在他比当初老得多了这时候彼得、苏珊、爱德蒙和露茜都已经做了好几年的纳尼亚国王和女王了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing like this had ever happened to Shasta in his life before. He had never even imagined lying on anything so comfortable as that sofa or drinking anything so delicious as that sherbet. He was still wondering what had happened to the others and how on earth he was going to escape and meet them at the Tombs, and what would happen when the real Corin turned up again. But none of these worries seemed so pressing now that he was comfortable. And perhaps, later on, there would be nice things to eat!</div>
