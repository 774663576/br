<div class="line_en">But then one day at the hospital, during a break between operations, a nurse called him to the telephone. He heard Tereza's voice coming from the receiver.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had phoned him from the railway station. He was overjoyed. Unfortunately, he had something on that evening and could not invite her to his place until the next day. The moment he hung up, he reproached himself for not telling her to go straight there. He had time enough to cancel his plans, after all! He tried to imagine what Tereza would do in Prague during the thirty-six long hours before they were to meet, and had half a mind to jump into his car and drive through the streets looking for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是从火车站打来的电话。他很高兴。但不巧的是，那天晚上他有事，只能请她第二天上他家。可一挂上电话，他又自责没有让她马上过来。他还有时间取消已定的约会！他寻思，特蕾莎在他们见面前这漫长的三十六小时里在布拉格会干什么，恨不得立即开车到城里的大街小巷去找她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She arrived the next evening, a handbag dangling from her shoulder, looking more elegant than before. She had a thick book under her arm. It was Anna Karenina.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天晚上，她来了。她斜挎着一个包，长长的背带，他觉得她比上次见到时要优雅。她手里拿着一本厚书，是托尔斯泰的《安娜·卡列宁娜》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She seemed in a good mood, even a little boisterous, and tried to make him think she had just happened to drop in, things had just worked out that way: she was in Prague on business, perhaps (at this point she became rather vague) to find a job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她显得挺开心的，甚至有点儿聒噪雀跃，努力对他装出她只是偶然路过的样子，是为了一件特别的事：她来布拉格是出于工作上的原因，或许（她的话非常含混）想找一份新工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, as they lay naked and spent side by side on the bed, he asked her where she was staying. It was night by then, and he offered to drive her there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，他们并排躺在长沙发上，光着身子，已精疲力竭。夜深了。他问她住在哪儿，他想开车送她回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Embarrassed, she answered that she still had to find a hotel and had left her suitcase at the station.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她有点尴尬地回答说她正要找一家旅社，来之前把行李寄存在车站了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only two days ago, he had feared that if he invited her to Prague she would offer him up her life. When she told him her suitcase was at the station, he immediately realized that the suitcase contained her life and that she had left it at the station only until she could offer it up to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前一天晚上，他还担心如果他请她来布拉格，她会来为他奉献一生呢。现在，听说她的行李寄存在火车站，他心想，在她把自己的一生奉献给他之前，已把它存放在那个行李箱里，并寄存在了车站。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How had he come to make such a sudden decision when for nearly a fortnight he had wavered so much that he could not even bring himself to send a postcard asking her how she was?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怎么能这么快就作出决定？近半个月来，他一直犹豫不定，甚至都没给她寄过一张明信片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two of them got into his car, which was parked in front of the house, and drove to the station. There he claimed the suitcase (it was large and enormously heavy) and took it and her home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和她一起上了停在房前的汽车，直奔火车站，取出箱子（箱子很大，重极了），带它和特蕾莎一起回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He himself was surprised. He had acted against his principles. Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage. He understood he was not born to live side by side with any woman and could be fully himself only as a bachelor. He tried to design his life in such a way that no woman could move in with a suitcase. That was why his flat had only the one bed. Even though it was wide enough, Tomas would tell his mistresses that he was unable to fall asleep with anyone next to him, and drive them home after midnight. And so it was not the flu that kept him from sleeping with Tereza on her first visit. The first night he had slept in his large armchair, and the rest of that week he drove each night to the hospital, where he had a cot in his office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他自己也对此感到惊讶。他这样做不符合他的原则。他和第一个妻子离婚有十年了，他是带着愉快的心情离婚的，就像别人庆祝结婚一样开心。于是他明白自己天生不是能在一个女人身边过日子的人，不管这个女人是谁，他也明白了只有单身，自己才感到真正自在。所以他费尽心机为自己设计一种生活方式，任何女人都永远不能拎着箱子住到他家来。这也是他只有一张长沙发的原因。尽管这张沙发相当宽敞，可他总和情人们说他和别人同床就睡不着觉，午夜后，他总是开车送她们回去。而且，就在特蕾莎第一次患流感住在他家的时候，他也没有和她一起睡。头一夜，他是在大扶手椅上过的，后几夜他都去医院的诊室，里面有一张他上夜班时用的长椅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He refrained from loosening his hand from her grip for fear of waking her, and turned carefully on his side to observe her better.</div>

<div class="line_en">But this time he fell asleep by her side. When he woke up the next morning, he found Tereza, who was still asleep, holding his hand. Could they have been hand in hand all night? It was hard to believe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可这一次，他在她身边睡着了。早上醒来，他发现特蕾莎还睡着，攥着他的手。他们是不是整夜都这么牵着手？这让他感到难以置信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And while she breathed the deep breath of sleep and held his hand (firmly: he was unable to disengage it from her grip), the enormously heavy suitcase stood by the bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="睡梦中她呼吸沉重，她攥着他的手（很紧，他无法摆脱），笨重的行李箱就摆在床边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas did not realize at the time that metaphors are dangerous. Metaphors are not to be trifled with. A single metaphor can give birth to love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯当时还没有意识到，比喻是一种危险的东西。人是不能和比喻闹着玩的。一个简单比喻，便可从中产生爱情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again it occurred to him that Tereza was a child put in a pitch-daubed bulrush basket and sent downstream. He couldn't very well let a basket with a child in it float down a stormy river! If the Pharaoh's daughter hadn't snatched the basket carrying little Moses from the waves, there would have been no Old Testament, no civilization as we now know it! How many ancient myths begin with the rescue of an abandoned child! If Polybus hadn't taken in the young Oedipus, Sophocles wouldn't have written his most beautiful tragedy!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又一次对自己说，特蕾莎是一个被人放在涂了树脂的篮子里顺水漂来的孩子。河水汹涌，怎么就能把这个放着孩子的篮子往水里放，任它漂呢！如果法老的女儿没有抓住水中那只放了小摩西的摇篮，世上就不会有《旧约》，也不会有我们全部的文明了！多少古老的神话，都以弃儿被人搭救的情节开始！如果波里布斯没有收养小俄狄浦斯，索福克勒斯就写不出他最壮美的悲剧了。">查看中文翻译</div>
