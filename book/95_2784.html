<div class="line_en">Most of these junkers weren't street legal. They didn't have proper registrations or proper number plates. Luckily, Abel also had a stack of old number plates in the back of the garage. I quickly learned I could just put one on an old car and hit the road. I was nineteen, maybe twenty, not thinking about any of the ramifications of this. I stopped by Abel's garage when no one was around, picked up one of the cars, the red Mazda I'd taken to the matric dance, slapped some old plates on it, and set off in search of discounted cell phones.</div>

<div class="line_en">I got pulled over in Hillbrow. Cops in South Africa don't give you a reason when they pull you over. Cops pull you over because they're cops and they have the power to pull you over; it's as simple as that. I used to watch American movies where cops would pull people over and say, "You didn't signal" or "Your taillight's out." I'd always wonder, Why do American cops bother lying? One thing I appreciate about South Africa is that we have not yet refined the system to the point where we feel the need to lie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开到希尔布洛的时候，我被警察拦了下来。南非的警察拦你停车不需要理由。警察拦你，只因为他们是警察，有权让你停车，就这么简单。我常常看美国电影，里面的警察让人停车后还要解释说，“你没打转向灯”，或“你尾灯没亮”。我总是在想，美国警察何苦还要编个谎啊？我很欣赏南非的一点是，我们的社会系统还没有文明到需要说谎的程度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Being young, funnily enough, I was more worried about getting in trouble with my parents than with the law. I'd had run-ins with the cops in Alexandra, in Soweto, but it was always more about the circumstance: a party getting shut down, a raid on a minibus. The law was all around me, but it had never come down on me, Trevor, specifically. And when you haven't had much experience with the law, the law appears rational -- cops are dicks for the most part, but you also recognize that they're doing a job.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the meantime, they'd been checking out the car, which wasn't going well for me, either. Whenever I borrowed cars from Abel's workshop, I tried to take the junkers rather than a real client's car; I thought I'd get in less trouble that way. That was a mistake. The Mazda, being one of Abel's junkers, didn't have a clear title of ownership. If it had had an owner, the cops would have called the owner, the owner would have explained that the car had been dropped off for repairs, and the whole thing would have been sorted out. Since the car didn't have an owner, I couldn't prove I hadn't stolen it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，他们查了那辆车的信息，结果对我也很不利。每次我从亚伯的修车厂借车，我都倾向于借那些没人要的破车，而不是真正的客户送来的车，我以为这样就能少惹麻烦。但那是个错误的选择。这辆马自达是亚伯厂里的众多破车之一，没有明确的车主归属，如果它有车主，那么警察给车主打个电话，车主就会解释说那辆车正在厂里维修，整件事就真相大白了。但这辆车没有车主，所以我根本无法证明不是偷来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd been picked up late in the afternoon, so by the time I was processed it was close to lights-out. I was spending the night in jail, like it or not. It was at that point that a cop pulled me aside and told me what I was in for.</div>

<div class="line_en">The way the system works in South Africa is that you're arrested and held in a cell at the police station until your bail hearing. At the hearing, the judge looks at your case, hears arguments from the opposing sides, and then he either dismisses the charges or sets bail and a trial date. If you can make bail, you pay and go home. But there are all sorts of ways your bail hearing can go wrong: You get some court-appointed lawyer who hasn't read your case and doesn't know what's going on. Your family can't pay your bail. It could even be that the court's backed up. "Sorry, we're too busy. No more hearings today." It doesn't matter the reason. Once you leave jail, you can't go back to jail. If your situation isn't resolved that day, you go to prison to await trial. In prison you're housed with the people awaiting trial, not with the general population, but even the awaiting-trial section is incredibly dangerous because you have people picked up for traffic violations all the way up to proper hardened criminals. You're stuck there together, and you can be there for days, weeks, maybe months. It's the same way in America. If you're poor, if you don't know how the system works, you can slip through the cracks, and the next thing you know you're in this weird purgatory where you're not in prison but you're not not in prison. You haven't been convicted of any crime, but you're still locked up and can't get out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="南非的程序是这样的，你被捕后，人要关在警察局的牢房里，直到保释听证会那天。听证会上，法官会看你的案子，听取检方意见，然后要么驳回起诉，要么设定保释金额和开庭日期。如果你可以支付保释金，那付完钱就可以回家了。但是你的保释听证会可能会出现各种纰漏：譬如你的法庭指定律师没看过你的卷宗，不知道现在是在干吗；你的家人付不起保释金；或者就是法庭本身要推迟工作。“对不起，我们太忙了。今天的听证到此结束。”不管理由如何，一旦你离开拘留所，你就不能再回来了，如果你的案子当天没有得到解决，那你要被转移到监狱里继续等待。在监狱里，你会和一群等待开庭的犯人关在一起，那可不是一群普通人。庭审等待室是个极其凶险的地方，和你关在一起的人中，小到违反交通法规的司机，大到不知悔改的惯犯，应有尽有。你和他们关在一起，可能有好几天，好几周，甚至好几个月。在美国也一样。如果你很穷，如果你不知道系统规则是什么样的，就很可能掉进这个裂缝中，然后你会发现，你身处一个诡异的炼狱之内，即不在监狱里，也不是不在监狱里。你没有被判有罪，但是你依然被关了起来，无法出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In South Africa, everyone knows that colored gangsters are the most ruthless, the most savage. It's a stereotype that's fed to you your whole life. The most notorious colored gangs are the Numbers Gangs: the 26s, the 27s, the 28s. They control the prisons. They're known for being brutally violent -- maiming, torturing, raping, cutting off people's heads -- not for the sake of making money but just to prove how ruthless and savage they are, like Mexican drug cartels. In fact a lot of these gangs base their thing on those Mexican gangs. They have the same look: the Converse All Stars with the Dickies pants and the open shirt buttoned only at the top.</div>

Nobody walks into a jail cell and says, "Hi, guys! I'm Brian!" Because everyone is afraid, and no one wants to appear vulnerable. Nobody wants to be the bitch. Nobody wants to be the guy getting killed. I didn't want anyone to know that I was just a kid in for a traffic charge, so I reached back in my mind for all the stereotypes of what I imagined people act like in prison, and then I tried to act like that.</div>

That's basically what I was doing -- the South African version of that. This was my brilliant plan to survive incarceration. But it worked.

We were all decent guys from nice neighborhoods and good families, picked up for unpaid parking tickets and other infractions. We could have been having a great time sharing meals, playing cards, and talking about women and soccer. But that didn't happen, because everyone had adopted this dangerous pose and nobody talked because everyone was afraid of who the other guys were pretending to be.

Black person to black person, and neither could understand the other -- the Tower of Babel.

I told him my trick of putting off your bail hearing to get your defense together, so he stayed in the cell, too, biding his time, and we hit it off and hung out for a few days, having a good time, getting to know each other. No one else in the cell knew what to make of us, the ruthless colored gangster and his menacing, Hulk-like friend. He told me his story, a South African story that was all too familiar to me: The man grows up under apartheid, working on a farm, part of what's essentially a slave labor force. It's a living hell but it's at least something. He's paid a pittance but at least he's paid. He's told where to be and what to do every waking minute of his day. Then apartheid ends and he doesn't even have that anymore. He finds his way to Johannesburg, looking for work, trying to feed his children back home. But he's lost. He has no education. He has no skills. He doesn't know what to do, doesn't know where to be. The world has been taught to be scared of him, but the reality is that he is scared of the world because he has none of the tools necessary to cope with it. So what does he do? He takes shit. He becomes a petty thief. He's in and out of jail. He gets lucky and finds some construction work, but then he gets laid off from that, and a few days later he's in a shop and he sees some PlayStation games and he grabs them, but he doesn't even know enough to know that he's stolen something of no value.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day of my hearing came. I said goodbye to my new friend and wished him the best. Then I was handcuffed and put in the back of a police van and driven to the courthouse to meet my fate. In South African courts, to minimize your exposure and your opportunities for escape, the holding cell where you await your hearing is a massive pen below the courtroom; you walk up a set of stairs into the dock rather than being escorted through the corridors. What happens in the holding cell is you're mixed in with the people who've been in prison awaiting trial for weeks and months. It's a weird mix, everything from white-collar criminals to guys picked up on traffic stops to real, hardcore criminals covered with prison tattoos. It's like the cantina scene from Star Wars, where the band's playing music and Han Solo's in the corner and all of the bad guys and bounty hunters from all over the universe are hanging out -- a wretched hive of scum and villainy, only there's no music and there's no Han Solo.</div>

How much money do you have? Who's your lawyer? Who's the judge? Shoplifting PlayStation games was less of an offense than driving with bad number plates. He had committed a crime, but he was no more a criminal than I was. The difference was that he didn't have any friends or family to help him out. He couldn't afford anything but a state attorney. He was going to go stand in the dock, unable to speak or understand English, and everyone in the courtroom was going to assume the worst of him.

<div class="line_en">When I walked into that holding pen, I was a smooth-skinned, fresh-faced young man. At the time, I had a giant Afro, and the only way to control it was to have it tied back in this ponytail thing that looked really girly. I looked like Maxwell. The guards closed the door behind me, and this creepy old dude yelled out in Zulu from the back, "Ha, ha, ha! Hhe madoda! Angikaze ngibone indoda enhle kangaka! Sizoba nobusuku obuhle!" "Yo, yo, yo! Damn, guys. I've never seen a man this beautiful before. It's gonna be a good night tonight!"</div>

<div class="line_en">I was with these people for only a brief window of time, but in that moment I saw the difference between prison and jail. I saw the difference between criminals and people who've committed crimes. I saw the hardness in people's faces. I thought back on how naive I'd been just hours before, thinking jail wasn't so bad and I could handle it. I was now truly afraid of what might happen to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只和这些人共处了很短的时间，但在这段时间里，我便已经发现监狱和拘留所的不同。我看到了罪犯和只是犯了小罪的人的不同。我看到了人们脸上的冷酷表情。我开始意识到，几个小时以前的我是那么天真，竟然觉得坐牢的体验没多糟，我还能接受。而现在的我，真的开始担心起自己接下来会受到什么样的对待了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Right next to me as I walked in was a young man having a complete meltdown, talking to himself, bawling his eyes out. He looked up and locked eyes with me, and I guess he thought I looked like a kindred soul he could talk to. He came straight at me and started crying about how he'd been arrested and thrown in jail and the gangs had stolen his clothes and his shoes and raped him and beat him every day. He wasn't some ruffian. He was well-spoken, educated. He'd been waiting for a year for his case to be heard; he wanted to kill himself. That guy put the fear of God in me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked around the holding cell. There were easily a hundred guys in there, all of them spread out and huddled into their clearly and unmistakably defined racial groups: a whole bunch of black people in one corner, the colored people in a different corner, a couple of Indians off to themselves, and a handful of white guys off to one side. The guys who'd been with me in the police van, the second we walked in, they instinctively, automatically, walked off to join the groups they belonged to. I froze.</div>

I know that I'm black and I identify as black, but I'm not a black person on the face of it, so would the black guys understand why I was walking over? And what kind of shit would I start by going there? Because going to the black corner as a perceived colored person might piss off the colored gangs even more than going to the colored corner as a fake colored person. Because that's what had happened to me my entire life. Colored people would see me hanging out with blacks, and they'd confront me, want to fight me. I saw myself starting a race war in the holding cell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，我走到黑人的角落里怎么样？我知道我是黑人，我也觉得自己是黑人，但是我的脸长得不像黑人，所以那些黑人看我走过来会怎么想？我走过去又会招惹什么麻烦呢？因为你看上去是个有色人种，但你又往黑人圈子里扎，这比我假装自己是有色人种暴匪，往有色人种圈子扎，更能激怒有色人种。有色人种会觉得我是在讨好黑人，他们就会和我杠上，过来揍我一顿。我仿佛看到自己要在这个牢房里引发一场种族战争。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was like the high school cafeteria, only it was the high school cafeteria from hell because if I picked the wrong table I might get beaten or stabbed or raped.
