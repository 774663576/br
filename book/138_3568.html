<div class="line_en">The rain was descending in torrents, a regular Normandy rain, which looked as if it were being poured out by some furious person, a slanting rain, opaque as a curtain, which formed a kind of wall with diagonal stripes, and which deluged everything, a rain such as one frequently experiences in the neighborhood of Rouen, which is the watering-pot of France.</div>

<div class="line_en">A cup of coffee was smoking on a small inlaid table, which was stained with liqueur, burned by cigars, notched by the penknife of the victorious officer, who occasionally would stop while sharpening a pencil, to jot down figures, or to make a drawing on it, just as it took his fancy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一杯咖啡热气腾腾地搁在一张独脚的圆桌子上，桌面子原是按照精巧图案嵌镶的，现在却被甜味烧酒留下了斑点，被雪茄烟烧出了焦痕，又被这个占领军官长拿着小刀划了许多数字和花纹，因为他有时候也拿着小刀去削铅笔，然而削的动作一停，他就凭着他那种无精打采的梦想意味拿起小刀在桌面子上乱划。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Major Graf Von Farlsberg, the Prussian commandant, was reading his newspaper as he lay back in a great easy-chair, with his booted feet on the beautiful marble mantelpiece where his spurs had made two holes, which had grown deeper every day during the three months that he had been in the chateau of Uville.</div>

<div class="line_en">The major was a giant, with broad shoulders and a long, fan-like beard, which hung down like a curtain to his chest. His whole solemn person suggested the idea of a military peacock, a peacock who was carrying his tail spread out on his breast. He had cold, gentle blue eyes, and a scar from a swordcut, which he had received in the war with Austria; he was said to be an honorable man, as well as a brave officer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="少校是个宽肩膀的大个儿，一嘴扇形般的长髯铺在胸前；他那种大人物的庄严丰采，使人想像到一只戎装的孔雀，一只可以把展开的长尾挂在自己下巴上的孔雀。他眼睛是蓝的，冷静而且柔和，脸上挂着一道刀痕，那是普奥战役留给他的；据说他是一个正直的人也是一个勇将。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a long time the officer looked at the sodden turf and at the swollen Andelle beyond it, which was overflowing its banks; he was drumming a waltz with his fingers on the window-panes, when a noise made him turn round. It was his second in command, Captain Baron van Kelweinstein.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那军官长久地望着窗外那片被水淹没的草地和远处那条漫过堤面的昂代勒河；他用手指头儿如同打鼓似地，在窗子的玻璃上面轻轻敲出一段莱茵河的华尔兹舞曲，这时候，一道响声使他回过头来：那是他的副营长开尔韦因石泰因子爵，官阶是上尉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain, a short, red-faced man, was tightly belted in at the waist, his red hair was cropped quite close to his head, and in certain lights he almost looked as if he had been rubbed over with phosphorus. He had lost two front teeth one night, though he could not quite remember how, and this sometimes made him speak unintelligibly, and he had a bald patch on top of his head surrounded by a fringe of curly, bright golden hair, which made him look like a monk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上尉是个满面红光的矮胖子，肚子捆得很紧，火红色的胡子几乎齐根剪掉，有时候在某种光线之下，竟可以使人以为他的脸上擦过了磷质。他在某一次欢乐之夜莫名其妙地失去了两颗门牙，使得他说起话来不大清楚，旁人始终听不出来；他是秃顶的，不过俨然是个行过剃发礼的宗教师，仅仅秃了顶门上那一部分，而围着那一块光秃秃的皮肤的四周全是金黄刷亮鬈起来的短头发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The commandant shook hands with him and drank his cup of coffee (the sixth that morning), while he listened to his subordinate's report of what had occurred; and then they both went to the window and declared that it was a very unpleasant outlook. The major, who was a quiet man, with a wife at home, could accommodate himself to everything; but the captain, who led a fast life, who was in the habit of frequenting low resorts, and enjoying women's society, was angry at having to be shut up for three months in that wretched hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="营长和他握了手又一口气喝了那杯咖啡（从早上算起已是第六杯了），一面听取他那个属下报告种种在勤务上发生的事故；随后他俩都走近窗口边一面高声说起景象真不快活。少校原是个安静的人，有妻小留在家里，对于什么都好说话；但是子爵上尉就不然了，他是个寻乐不倦的人，爱跑小胡同，爱追女人，3个月以来，他一直被人关在这个孤立的据点里守着强迫的清净规则，真是满肚子不痛快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a knock at the door, and when the commandant said, "Come in," one of the orderlies appeared, and by his mere presence announced that breakfast was ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人又叫门了，营长叫了一声请进来，于是他们的一个部下，一个好像机动傀儡般的小兵在门口出现了，只要看见他在此刻出现，就可以说明午饭已经伺候停当。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since he had been in France his comrades had called him nothing but Mademoiselle Fifi. They had given him that nickname on account of his dandified style and small waist, which looked as if he wore corsets; of his pale face, on which his budding mustache scarcely showed, and on account of the habit he had acquired of employing the French expression, 'Fi, fi donc', which he pronounced with a slight whistle when he wished to express his sovereign contempt for persons or things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从侵入法国以来，他那些朋友都只用法国语叫他做菲菲小姐。这个绰号的来由，是因为他的姿态倜傥，他的腰身细巧使人可以说那是缚了一副女人用的腰甲，他的脸色苍白仅仅只显出一点点初生的髭须影子，以及他用来待人接物的习惯——那种习惯就是为着表示自己蔑视一切的崇高态度，他随时用一种轻轻吹哨子般的声音道出一句法国成语：“菲菲”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the dining-room they met three other officers of lower rank -- a lieutenant, Otto von Grossling, and two sub-lieutenants, Fritz Scheuneberg and Baron von Eyrick, a very short, fair-haired man, who was proud and brutal toward men, harsh toward prisoners and as explosive as gunpowder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在饭厅里，早有三个军阶较低的军官：一个中尉，倭妥—格洛斯林；两个少尉，弗利茨—硕因瑙堡和威廉—艾力克侯爵；那侯爵是个浅黄头发的矮个儿，对于一般人自负而且粗鲁，对于战败者残忍而且暴烈，简直像是一种火药。">查看中文翻译</div>

The bottles of brandy and of liqueur passed from hand to hand, and all sat back in their chairs and took repeated sips from their glasses, scarcely removing from their mouths the long, curved stems, which terminated in china bowls, painted in a manner to delight a Hottentot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完了以后，他们在吸烟的时间又动手再喝起来，每天在这种时间里，他们必须重复地议论他们的烦闷无聊。好些瓶白兰地和甜味烧酒从各人的手里传递不停；全体都是把半个身子斜躺在椅子上的，拿着杯子慢慢地喝了又喝，同时他们嘴角上，仍旧都衔着一枝德国烟斗，烟斗的杆子是长而曲的，头儿上装着一个蛋形的瓷质烟锅，而且素来是画得花花绿绿如同为了引诱霍屯督人一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dining-room of the chateau was a magnificent long room, whose fine old mirrors, that were cracked by pistol bullets, and whose Flemish tapestry, which was cut to ribbons, and hanging in rags in places from sword-cuts, told too well what Mademoiselle Fifi's occupation was during his spare time.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were three family portraits on the walls a steel-clad knight, a cardinal and a judge, who were all smoking long porcelain pipes, which had been inserted into holes in the canvas, while a lady in a long, pointed waist proudly exhibited a pair of enormous mustaches, drawn with charcoal.</div>

<div class="line_en">And the major ended by yielding. "Very well," he replied, and the baron immediately sent for Le Devoir. He was an old non-commissioned officer, who had never been seen to smile, but who carried out all the orders of his superiors to the letter, no matter what they might be. He stood there, with an impassive face, while he received the baron's instructions, and then went out, and five minutes later a large military wagon, covered with tarpaulin, galloped off as fast as four horses could draw it in the pouring rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="少校终于让步了：“可以，”他说；于是子爵立刻派人叫了“义务”来，“义务”是一个年老的上士，谁也从没有看见他笑过，但是上级派给他的种种命令不管性质如何，他都出人意外地完成得毫无缺憾。他神情自若地站着接受子爵的吩咐，随后他出去了，五分钟以后，一辆张着直墙圆顶的油布篷子的军用马车，被四匹飞奔的马在狂雨下面拉着走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Suddenly, looking at the lady with the mustaches, the young fellow pulled out his revolver and said: "You shall not see it." And without leaving his seat he aimed, and with two successive bullets cut out both the eyes of the portrait.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bells had not rung since their arrival. That was the only resistance which the invaders had met with in the neighborhood. The parish priest had not refused to take in and to feed the Prussian soldiers; he had several times even drunk a bottle of beer or claret with the hostile commandant, who often employed him as a benevolent intermediary; but it was no use to ask him for a single stroke of the bells; he would sooner have allowed himself to be shot. That was his way of protesting against the invasion, a peaceful and silent protest, the only one, he said, which was suitable to a priest, who was a man of mildness, and not of blood; and every one, for twenty-five miles round, praised Abbe Chantavoine's firmness and heroism in venturing to proclaim the public mourning by the obstinate silence of his church bells.</div>

<div class="line_en">Contrary to all expectation, the priest showed himself humble and most respectful, and when Mademoiselle Fifi's body left the Chateau d'Uville on its way to the cemetery, carried by soldiers, preceded, surrounded and followed by soldiers who marched with loaded rifles, for the first time the bell sounded its funeral knell in a lively manner, as if a friendly hand were caressing it.</div>
