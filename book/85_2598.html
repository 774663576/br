<div class="line_en">The little girl appeared to be Asian, maybe five or six years old, with a beautiful cinnamon complexion, hair the color of a dark plum, a small flat nose, full lips that spread joyfully over her gapped teeth, and the most arresting eyes, as black as a seal's hide, with a pinhead of white serving as a pupil. She smiled and flapped her hands excitedly until Eddie edged one step closer, whereupon she presented herself.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她微笑起来，好像游戏开始了。她用手指了指她那被河水浸透、松散地搭在肩膀上的绣花上衣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="其他孩子们似乎都没有注意到他。他们泼水、打滚、从河床上捡石头。爱迪看到一个男孩子用一块石头在另一个孩子的身上摩擦着，摩擦他的背部，摩擦他的腋下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then came her cloglike shoes --"bakya"-- then the iridescent seashells by her feet --"capiz"-- then a woven bamboo mat --"banig"-- that was laid out before her. She motioned for Eddie to sit on the mat and she sat, too, her legs curled underneath her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，是她那双类似木屐的鞋－－“巴克亚”－－然后，是她脚边五光十色的贝壳－－“卡匹兹”－－然后，是摆在她面前的一张竹编的垫子－－“巴尼格”。她示意爱迪坐在垫子上，她也跟着坐下。两腿蜷曲在身下。">查看中文翻译</div>

He wondered if she and the other children had chosen this riverbank heaven, or if, given their short memories, such a serene landscape had been chosen for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪一生中听过好多孩子讲话，但是，在这个孩子的声音里，他察觉不到丝毫同大人讲话时的拘谨。他不知道，她和其他孩子们是不是选择了这片河岸作为他们的天堂，或者，鉴于他们的人生记忆如此短暂，人们为他们选择了如此宁静的景色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She smiled back, but this only made him fall apart. His face collapsed, and he buried it in his palms. His shoulders and lungs gave way. The darkness that had shadowed him all those years was revealing itself at last, it was real, flesh and blood, this child, this lovely child, he had killed her, burned her to death, the bad dreams he'd suffered, he'd deserved every one. He had seen something! That shadow in the flame! Death by his hand! By his own fiery hand! A flood of tears soaked through his fingers and his soul seemed to plummet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小女孩回报了他一个微笑，但这样反倒让他崩溃了。他脸色一变，将脸埋在手掌里，双肩抽搐，大哭起来。多年以来一直笼罩着他的那个阴影，终于显现出来，一切都是真的，有血有肉，这个孩子，这个可爱的孩子，他杀害了她，他把她烧死了。他做的那些噩梦，他活该受那些噩梦的折磨。他确实看到了什么东西！火焰里的那个影子！他亲手造成的死亡！就是他这双罪恶的手！眼泪如泉水般地从他的指缝里涌出，他彻底垮了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wailed then, and a howl rose within him in a voice he had never heard before, a howl from the very belly of his being, a howl that rumbled the river water and shook the misty air of heaven. His body convulsed, and his head jerked wildly, until the howling gave way to prayerlike utterances, every word expelled in the breathless surge of confession: "I killed you, I KILLED YOU," then a whispered "forgive me," then, "FORGIVE ME, OH, GOD…" and finally, "What have I done… WHAT HAVE I DONE?…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他号啕大哭起来，这是一声从他身体里发出来的他从未听见过的嚎叫，是一声从他灵魂深处迸发出来的嚎叫，是一声令河水翻腾、让天堂中笼罩着薄雾的空气亦为之震撼的嚎叫。他的身体抽搐着，头疯狂地扭动，直到那嚎叫渐渐地变成了祈祷似的喃喃自语，一字一句从心底里排出，又像屏住呼吸时急切的忏悔：“我杀害了你，我杀害了你，”接着，耳语般地说，“原谅我，”然后，“噢，上帝呀，原谅我…”最后，“我都干了什么…？我都干了什么呀…？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At some point, when his anguish had quieted, Eddie felt a tapping on his shoulder. He looked up to see Tala holding out a stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知过了多久，当爱迪从极度的痛苦中缓解出来，他感到肩膀上被人拍了一下。他抬起头，见塔拉站在他面前，手上举着一块石头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你洗我，”她说。她走进河水里，背朝着爱迪。然后，她把她的绣花“巴洛”从头上脱了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wept and he wept, until the weeping drained him to a shiver. Then he shook silently, swaying back and forth. He was kneeling on a mat before the little dark-haired girl, who played with her pipe-cleaner animal along the bank of the flowing river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他哭呀，哭呀，直哭到精疲力竭，浑身打颤。然后，他默不作声地跪在黑发小女孩面前的一个垫了上。身体前后摇摆着。小女孩坐在河岸上，玩弄着她的烟斗通条小动物，流水潺潺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He recoiled. Her skin was horribly burned. Her torso and narrow shoulders were black and charred and blistered. When she turned around, the beautiful, innocent face was covered in grotesque scars. Her lips drooped. Only one eye was open. Her hair was gone in patches of burned scalp, covered now by hard, mottled scabs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪倒退了两步。她遍体烧伤，她的躯干和纤细的肩膀被烧成了炭黑色，烧起了水泡。她转过身来，天真漂亮的脸蛋上布满了令人怵目的疤痕。她的嘴唇耷拉着，只有一只眼睛睁开。她的头发不见了，露出一块块烧焦的头皮，头皮上结着硬邦邦的、颜色深浅不一的痂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She raised her charred hand and Eddie gripped it gently and slowly rubbed the stone along her forearm, until the scars began to loosen. He rubbed harder; they peeled away. He quickened his efforts until the singed flesh fell and the healthy flesh was visible. Then he turned the stone over and rubbed her bony back and tiny shoulders and the nape of her neck and finally her cheeks and her forehead and the skin behind her ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抬起一只烧焦的手，爱迪轻轻地抓住，慢慢地用石头在她的手臂上摩擦起来，直到伤疤开始出现裂纹。他更用力地摩擦起来，结痂开始脱落。他加快速度，直到烧焦的皮肤退去。新鲜的皮肤长出。然后，他把石头反过来，开始摩擦她瘦削的脊背、纤细的肩膀和她的后颈，最后，她的面颊，前额和耳后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She leaned backward into him, resting her head on his collarbone, shutting her eyes as if falling into a nap. He traced gently around the lids. He did the same with her drooped lips, and the scabbed patches on her head, until the plum-colored hair emerged from the roots and the face that he had seen at first was before him again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她身体向后，靠在他的身上，将头倚在他的肩膀上，她闭着眼睛。好像睡着了。他顺着她的眼帘轻轻地摩擦。然后，他摩擦她耷拉的嘴唇和头上的结痂，直到乌梅色的头发从根部长出，爱迪最初见到的那张脸又出现在他的面前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tala smiled and scooped up river water, then placed her small wet fingers in Eddie's adult grip. He knew right away they had been there before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔拉微笑了一下，用手舀起一些河水，然后，将两只湿漉漉的小手放在爱迪的大手掌里。他一下子就明白了，他曾经握过这双小手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was nothing now, a leaf in the water, and she pulled him gently, through shadow and light, through shades of blue and ivory and lemon and black, and he realized all these colors, all along, were the emotions of his life. She drew him up through the breaking waves of a great gray ocean and he emerged in brilliant light above an almost unimaginable scene:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他似乎已经不复存在，像河水里的一片落叶。她用手轻轻地拉着他，穿过光亮和阴影，穿过各种各样不同的颜色－－蓝色、乳白色、柠檬色和黑色，他意识到，所有这些颜色都是他生活情感的写照。她拉着他从灰色大海上破浪而出，现身在一片光明中，俯瞰着眼前一幕令人难以想像的场景：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With that, the river rose quickly, engulfing Eddie's waist and chest and shoulders. Before he could take another breath, the noise of the children disappeared above him, and he was submerged in a strong but silent current. His grip was still entwined with Tala's, but he felt his body being washed from his soul, meat from the bone, and with it went all the pain and weariness he ever held inside him, every scar, every wound, every bad memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小女孩的话音来落，河水骤然鼓涨起来，淹没了爱迪的腰、胸和肩膀。他还没来得及再吸一口气，孩子们的声音便在他头顶上消失了，他被卷入一股寂静无声的激流中。他仍然紧紧地抓着塔拉的手，但是，他感到他的肉身被激流从灵魂上冲走了，血肉脱离了骨头。聚积在他身体里的所有的痛苦，所有的疲劳，每一个疤痕，每一个创伤，每一段令人伤心的记忆，全都随之而去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a pier filled with thousands of people, men and women, fathers and mothers and children -- so many children -- children from the past and the present, children who had not yet been born, side by side, hand in hand, in caps, in short pants, filling the boardwalk and the rides and the wooden platforms, sitting on each other's shoulders, sitting in each other's laps. They were there, or would be there, because of the simple, mundane things Eddie had done in his life, the accidents he had prevented, the rides he had kept safe, the unnoticed turns he had affected every day. And while their lips did not move, Eddie heard their voices, more voices than he could have imagined, and a peace came upon him that he had never known before. He was free of Tala's grasp now, and he floated up above the sand and above the boardwalk, above the tent tops and spires of the midway toward the peak of the big, white Ferris wheel, where a cart, gently swaying, held a woman in a yellow dress -- his wife, Marguerite, waiting with her arms extended. He reached for her and he saw her smile and the voices melded into a single word from God: Home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个码头上，挤满了成千上万的人，男人们和女人们，父亲们、母亲们和孩子们－－那么多孩子－－过去的孩子，现在的孩子，没有出世的孩子，肩并肩。手拉手，戴着帽子。穿着短裤。lz在海滨走道上，在游乐车里。在木板平台上，骑在彼此的肩膀上，坐在彼此的膝盖上。他们在那里，或者将在那里，正是由于爱迪一生简单平凡的工作，因为他向避免的事故，由他保证的游乐车的安全，以及每天在人们不经意的时候，他在他们的生活中造成的转折。虽然他们的嘴唇没有翕动，但是，爱迪能听到他们的声音，那么多的声音，真是令人难以置信，他感到心中滋生出一种从来体验过的宁静。塔拉的手消失了，他高高地漂浮在沙滩上，在海滨走道上。在娱乐场的帐篷和尖塔上。他朝着那个大型白色的“阜氏巨型摩天轮”上空飘移过去，一个轻轻摇摆的座位上，坐着一个身穿黄色连衣裙的女人－－他的妻子。玛格丽特，正张开双臂等候着他。他伸出手去够她，他看到了她的微笑，然后，所有的声音融化了，凝聚成从上帝那里传来的一个字：家。">查看中文翻译</div>
