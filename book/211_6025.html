<div class="line_en">The hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares, and the atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the dairy-folk, the cows, and the trees. Hot steaming rains fell frequently, making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank, and hindering the late haymaking in the other meads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七月的炎热天气在不知不觉中来到了人们身边，平坦山谷中的大气好像麻醉剂一样，既沉重又沉闷，笼罩着奶牛场的人们、奶牛和树木。热气腾腾的绵绵大雨，使得供奶牛放牧的牧草长得更加茂盛了，但是也妨碍了其它牧场上晚期收割牧草的工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Sunday morning; the milking was done; the outdoor milkers had gone home. Tess and the other three were dressing themselves rapidly, the whole bevy having agreed to go together to Mellstock Church, which lay some three or four miles distant from the dairy-house. She had now been two months at Talbothays, and this was her first excursion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个礼拜天的早晨；牛奶已经挤完了；住在场外的挤奶工人也回家了。梅尔斯托克教堂离奶牛场大约有三四英里远近，苔丝和另外三个挤奶的女工已经商量好了，打算一块儿去那儿作礼拜，所以她们就迅速换好了衣服。到现在为止，苔丝来泰波塞斯已经两个月了，这还是她第一次出门去玩。在头一天的整个下午和晚上，雷阵雨哗哗地倾倒在牧场上，牧场上有些干草也被冲进河里去了；但是今天早上，大地经过雨水的冲洗，太阳照射在牧场上，显得更加明亮，空气清新而芬芳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed down upon the meads, and washed some of the hay into the river; but this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge, and the air was balmy and clear. The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along the lowest levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain had been to flood the lane over-shoe to a distance of some fifty yards. This would have been no serious hindrance on a week-day; they would have clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite unconcerned; but on this day of vanity, this Sun's-day, when flesh went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with spiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their white stockings and thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac gowns, on which every mud spot would be visible, the pool was an awkward impediment. They could hear the church-bell calling -- as yet nearly a mile off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从她们的教区通往梅尔斯托克的那条弯弯曲曲的小路，有一段是沿着谷中最低洼的地方通过的。那几个姑娘走到那段最低洼的地方时，发现大雨过后有一段大约五十码长的路面被淹没了，积水深过脚面。在平常的日子里，这并不是什么大不了的障碍；她们都是穿的高底木头套鞋和靴子，可以满不在乎地从水中蹚过去；但是这天是礼拜天，是她们抛头露面的日子，她们口头说的是去进行精神上的陶冶，而实际上是去进行肉体征服肉体的谈情说爱；这个时候她们都会穿上白色的袜子和轻俏的鞋，有的穿粉红的连衣裙，有的穿白色的连衣裙，有的穿淡紫色的连衣裙，只要上面溅上了一点儿泥都能被人看见；这片水塘把她们挡住了，叫她们犯了难。她们能够听见教堂的钟声已经敲响了——可是她们差不多还在一英里路以外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“谁能够想到在夏天这条河里还会涨这样大的水呢！”玛丽安说，她们已经爬到了路边的坡顶上，犹豫不定地站在那儿，希望沿着山坡爬过去，绕过那个水塘。“如果不从水里蹚过去，或者另外从征收通行税的路上绕过去，我们是过不了这个水塘的；要是绕过去的话，我们一定很晚才能到！”莱蒂毫无办法地站在那儿说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed quartet looked so charming in their light summer attire, clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a roof-slope, that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming close. Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable files and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in the transparent tissue as in an aviary. Angel's eye at last fell upon Tess, the hindmost of the four; she, being full of suppressed laughter at their dilemma, could not help meeting his glance radiantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个姑娘的面颊红扑扑的，明亮的大眼睛水汪汪的，身穿轻盈的夏装站在路边的土坡上，就像鸽子挤在屋脊上一样，看上去是那样迷人，因此他在走到她们跟前之前，就停下来把她们端详了一番。姑娘们穿着细纱长裙，长裙的下摆从草丛中赶出来无数的飞虫和蝴蝶，它们被关在透明的裙摆之中飞不出来，就像关在笼中的小鸟一样。安琪尔的眼光终于落在了苔丝的身上。苔丝站在四人队伍的最后，正为她们进退两难而忍不住要笑的时候，接触到他的目光，不禁变得容光焕发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'No -- I wish he was!' murmured Tess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是的——但我希望他是上教堂去的！”苔丝低声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Angel, in fact, rightly or wrongly (to adopt the safe phrase of evasive controversialists), preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches and chapels on fine summer days. This morning, moreover, he had gone out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was considerable or not. On his walk he observed the girls from a long distance, though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of passage as not to notice him. He knew that the water had risen at that spot, and that it would quite check their progress. So he had hastened on, with a dim idea of how he could help them -- one of them in particular.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，对也好错也罢（借用巧舌如簧的辩论家的话），在夏季天气晴朗的日子里，安琪尔与其说在大小教堂里听人讲道，不如说是在大自然里接受教训。而且这天早晨，他还出门去了解过洪水冲走干草是不是带来了巨大的损失。他在路上老远就望见了那几个姑娘们，尽管她们把心思集中在途中的困难上而没有注意到他。他知道那个地点的水位已经升高了，也知道那片积水完全有可能成为她们路上的障碍。所以，他就急急忙忙地赶来，心里模模糊糊地想着怎样才能帮助她们——尤其是要帮助她们中间的某一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你们要过去，这是唯一的办法了。站着别动。瞎说——你们不会太重的！我能够把你们四个人一起抱起来。好了，玛丽女，你来吧，”他接着说，“把你的胳膊伸过来，抱着我的肩膀，就这样。好啦！抱紧。你做得很好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Yes,' said Izz, 'I've always a' ear at church for pretty verses.' Angel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She quietly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically marched off with her. When he was heard returning for the third time Retty's throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her. He went up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess. His lips could not have pronounced more plainly, 'It will soon be you and J.' Her comprehension appeared in her face; she could not help it. There was an understanding between them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，”伊茨说，“在教堂里，我总是喜欢这些漂亮的诗句。”安琪尔·克莱尔现在走到了伊茨的面前，不过在他的这番举动里，有四分之三是出于一种帮忙的性质。伊茨一声不响地朦朦胧胧地伏到克莱尔的肩上，克莱尔机械地把她抱起来走了。当莱蒂听见他第三次转回来时，她那一颗心怦怦地跳着，把她激动得差不多都摇晃起来了。克莱尔走到这个长着红头发的姑娘面前，在他把她抱起来时，他看了苔丝一眼。他不能够用嘴巴把话更明白地说出来。“一会儿就只剩下你和我了。”她脸上的表情说明她理解了他的意思；她有些喜形于色。他们都能善解人意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, he got through with the disquieted creature, deposited her, and returned. Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a group, standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground. It was now her turn. She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the proximity of Mr Clare's breath and eyes, which she had contemned in her companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of betraying her secret she pattered with him at the last moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他还是把这个不安静的姑娘抱过了水塘，把她放在地上，转身走了，苔丝从树篱的顶上望过去，看见远处她们三个人挤在一起，站在他把她们放下的那块高地上，现在轮到她了。苔丝心里感到局促不安，因为她看见她的伙伴们接近克莱尔的呼吸和眼睛时那样激动，曾经嗤之以鼻，而现在却轮到她自己紧张了；她好像是害怕泄露了自己心中的秘密似的，到了最后一刻竟然推托搪塞起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The air of the sleeping-chamber seemed to palpitate with the hopeless passion of the girls. They writhed feverishly under the oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature's law -- an emotion which they had neither expected nor desired. The incident of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out, and the torture was almost more than they could endure. The differences which distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by this passion, and each was but portion of one organism called sex. There was so much frankness and so little jealousy because there was no hope. Each one was a girl of fair common sense, and she did not delude herself with any vain conceits, or deny her love, or give herself airs, in the idea of outshining the others. The full recognition of the futility of their infatuation, from a social point of view; its purposeless beginning; its self-bounded outlook; its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye of civilization (while lacking nothing in the eye of Nature); the one fact that it did exist, ecstasizing them to a killing joy; all this imparted to them a resignation, a dignity, which a practical and sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="姑娘们的爱情既然没有了希望，卧室里的气氛也就变得烦躁不安起来。冷酷的自然法则把她们的感情激发出来——这种感情既不是她们想要的，也不是她们情愿的，就是在这种感情的压力下，她们在床上辗转反侧，久久不能入睡。白天发生的事已经燃起了火苗，在她们的胸膛里燃烧着，折磨着她们，使她们痛苦得几乎无法忍受了。她们作为个体存在的差别被这种感情消除了，她们每一个人都不过是被称作女人的这种有机体的一部分。因为谁也没有希望，所以她们都是那样坦诚，没有一点儿忌妒。她们每一个人都是明白事理的姑娘，谁也没有想到为了超过别人，就用虚荣的幻想去自欺欺人，或是去否认她们的爱情，或去卖弄风情。从她们的身分地位看，她们完全明白她们的痴情不会有什么结果；这件事从一开始就是没有意义的；是她们自己建立起来的思想观念在作怪；从文明的观点看，她们的爱情根本就没有任何存在的理由（但是从自然的观点看，什么理由也不缺少）；事实是，爱情是确实存在的，而且给她们带来的极度喜悦到了销魂蚀魄的程度；所有这一切也使她们产生出一种听天由命和自尊自重的思想，而她们要是真的去争夺他作丈夫，卑鄙地想心思，那么这种态度就会被破坏掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that there lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare's attentions to her. It was a passing summer love of her face, for love's own temporary sake -- nothing more. And the thorny crown of this sad conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way to the rest, she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature, cleverer, more beautiful than they, was in the eyes of propriety far less worthy of him than the homelier ones whom he ignored.</div>
