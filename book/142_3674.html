<div class="line_en">The bloody victory of the Corleone Family was not complete until a year of delicate political maneuvering established Michael Corleone as the most powerful Family chief in the United States. For twelve months, Michael divided his time equally between his headquarters at the Long Beach mall and his new home in Las Vegas. But at the end of that year he decided to close out the New York operation and sell the houses and the mall property. For that purpose he brought his whole family East on a last visit. They would stay a month, wind up business, Kay would do the personal family's packing and shipping of household goods. There were a million other minor details.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="考利昂家族目前得到的胜利，也只是初步的。经过一年的活动，在政治方面采取了徽妙的尔虞我诈的手法，使迈克尔成了美国最强大的黑帮家族首领之后，才算完成了。这十二个月，迈克尔把自己的时间平均分成两半：一半用于长滩镇林荫道大本营，一半用于他在韦加斯的新基地。但是，在那年年底，他却决定要结束在纽约的活动，要卖掉房子和林荫道的财产。因此，他把全家都带到东部进行最后一次访问。他们打算住一个月，顺便做做业务上的扫尾工作。恺将负责家庭用品方面的包装运输，此外，也还有无数小事需要料理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Time helped heal the old wounds. Connie Corleone was reconciled to her brother Michael. Indeed not more than a week after her terrible accusations she apologized to Michael for what she had said and assured Kay that there had been no truth in her words, that it had been only a young widow's hysteria.</div>

<div class="line_en">To her surprise, Kay came to love living in Nevada. She loved the scenery, the hills and canyons of garishly red rock, the burning deserts, the unexpected and blessedly refreshing lakes, even the heat. Her two boys rode their own ponies. She had real servants, not bodyguards. And Michael lived a more normal life. He owned a construction business; he joined the businessmen's clubs and civic committees; he had a healthy interest in local politic without interfering publicly. It was a good life. Kay was happy that they were closing down their New York house and that Las Vegas would be truly their permanent home. She hated coming back to New York. And so on this last trip she had arranged all the packing and shipping of goods with the utmost efficiency and speed, and now on the final day she felt chat same urgency to leave that longtime patients feel when it is time to be discharged from the hospital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺喜欢住在内华达州，连她自己也感到奇怪。她喜欢这里的风光，喜欢这里的山峦、峡谷、鲜红的岩石、火红的旷野、令人感到心旷神怡的奇异而美妙的湖泊，甚至连这里酷热的气候她也喜欢。她的两个男孩各人都有一匹小马，平时就骑着去玩。如今为她效劳的是真正的佣人而下是保镶。迈克尔也过上了比较正规的生活。他自己开办了个建筑公司；他参加了商人俱乐部，当上了市民委员会的委员；他对地方政治也有健康的兴趣，但并没有公开介入。这种生活是挺不错的。恺感到高兴的是他们关闭了纽约基地，韦加斯将真正是他们永久的安身之所。提起回到纽约，她就很有反感。因此，在最后访问纽约时，她一手包办了全部家用物品的包装和运输工作，而且办得极其利落，极其迅速。在这最后一天里，她急于离开纽约，这种心情简直就像久住医院的病人在病愈后急于离开医院一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kay Adams Corleone had delighted her in-laws by taking instruction in the Catholic religion and joining that faith. Her two boys were also, naturally, being brought up in that church, as was required. Michael himself had not been too pleased by this development. He would have preferred the children to be Protestant, it was more American.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺·亚当姆斯·考利昂认真听取人家讲解天主教的道理，也跟着信了天主教，这可使她的婆婆、姑姑大为高兴。她的两个男孩按照要求，自然地也正在接受天主教教育。迈克尔本人对这种新动向可并不大满意。他宁愿让自己的孩子当耶稣教徒，因为耶稣教更合乎美国人情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Connie Corleone easily found a new husband; in fact, she did not wait the year of respect before filling her bed again with a fine young fellow who had come to work for the Corleone Family as a male secretary. A boy from a reliable Italian family but graduated from the top business college in America. Naturally his marriage to the sister of the Don made his future assured.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她听到这话，心里感到不是滋味，因而警觉起来。他仔细打量着她，他这时的目光就是她暗自认为的“老头子”的目光。“孩子来日方长嘛，”她说，“等咱们回到那里的家，我自然会让他们比较经常地进教堂的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="老太太赞赏地点了点头。本来在领圣体之前，从半夜起就不许吃喝，有一次恺却把这规定忘了。这已经是很久以前的事了，但是老太太却因此对她一直不放心，每次都要间一下。“不吃早点，你感到习惯了吗？”老太太问。">查看中文翻译</div>

It had become a set routine, early Mass, every morning, together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她同他吻别后就走了。房子外面已经开始暖和起来了。夏天的太阳正从东方升起，显得红彤彤的。恺向大门附近停着的汽车走去。考利昂妈妈穿着她的黑色寡妇服，早已坐在汽车里等她了。这已经是长期定下来的例行公事：听早弥撒，每天早晨必去，两人同去同回。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The church was small and desolate in the early morning sunlight. Its stained-glass windows shielded the interior from heat, it would be cool there, a place to rest. Kay helped her mother-in-law up the white stone steps and then let her go before her. The old woman preferred a pew up front, close to the altar. Kay waited on the steps for an extra minute. She was always reluctant at this last moment, always a little fearful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教堂很小，在清晨的阳光下显得很冷清。窗子上的彩色玻璃是隔热的，教堂里面很凉快，是个休息的好地方。恺扶着婆婆上了白石台阶，然后放开手，让婆婆自己朝前走去。老太太总喜欢前排，喜欢靠近祭坛的位于。但在台阶上迟疑了一分钟。她每次进教堂前的这一瞬间总有点犹豫，总有点怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally she entered the cool darkness. She took the holy water on her fingertips and made the sign of the cross, fleetingly touched her wet fingertips to her parched lips. Candles flickered redly before the saints, the Christ on his cross. Kay genuflected before entering her row and then knelt on the hard wooden rail of the pew to wait for her call to Communion. She bowed her head as if she were praying, but she was not quite ready for that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她终于走进了凉飕飕、黑沉沉的教堂。她用指头蘸了点圣水，在胸前划了个十字，同时，用湿手指尖在干燥的嘴唇上急速地点了一下。蜡烛在圣像前，在十字架上的基督像前，闪着红光。恺先行了一个屈膝礼，然后走进她那一排座位，跪在硬木条上，等待着去领圣体。她低着头，活像是在祈祷，其实她实在心不在焉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had left him because of that lie, not because of the deed. The next morning she had taken the children away with her to her parents' house in New Hampshire.

He loves his sister. But he would be shirking his duty to you and his children, to his whole family, to me and my family, if he let Tessio and Carlo go free. They would have been a danger to us all, all our lives."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根继续说：“还有一些事情，我也要对你直话直说。老头子死后，迈克尔被定为杀害对象。你可知道是谁定的吗？是忒希奥。因此，忒希奥必须杀掉。卡罗，也必须杀掉。因为背叛行为是不可宽容的。迈克尔本来也可能宽容这种行为，但是，凡是犯了这种错误的人，都绝不会宽容自己。他们始终心怀鬼胎，因此他们始终是危险的。迈克尔也实在喜欢忒希奥；迈克尔也真心爱他妹妹。但是，要是让忒希奥和卡罗这两人造遥法外，那他就等于对你、对他的孩子、对他的全家、对我和我的家庭，推卸责任。这两个家伙对咱们大家，对咱们大家的生命，都是一颗定时炸弹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From the innermost recess of the church the bell tolled for repentance. As she had been taught to do, Kay struck her breast lightly with her clenched hand, the stroke of repentance. The bell tolled again and there was the shuffling of feet as the communicants left their seats to go to the altar rail. Kay rose to join them. She knelt at the altar and from the depths of the church the bell tolled again. With her closed hand she struck her heart once more. The priest was before her. She tilted back her head and opened her mouth to receive the papery thin wafer. This was the most terrible moment of all. Until it melted away and she could swallow and she could do what she came to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从教堂的深处传来了一阵钟声，要人们忏悔。恺按照人家教给她的办法，右手握起拳头，轻轻地捶击自己的胸口，这就是忏悔的表示。钟声第二次又响了，只听到了一阵沙沙的脚步声，要领圣体的人们纷纷离开自己的位置向祭坛前的栏杆走去。恺也站了起来，随着大家一道走去。她跪在祭坛的栏杆外面，从教堂深处第三次传来了一阵钟声。她仰起头，张开嘴，准备领取像纸一样薄的小面饼。这是最可怕的时刻。等到小面饼在嘴里溶解了，她可以咽下去的时候，她的紧张情绪才能消除，她也才可以随便一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
