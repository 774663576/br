<div class="line_en">Mr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague "Merry Christmas."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只睡了几个小时，韦斯莱先生就把他们叫醒了。他用魔法把帐篷收起来装进背包，然后他们尽快离开了营地，路上看见罗伯茨先生站在他小石屋的门口。罗伯茨先生的样子怪怪的，神情恍惚，他朝他们挥手告别，还含混地说了句“圣诞快乐”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He'll be all right," said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. "Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while… and that was a big thing they had to make him forget."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不会有事的，”他们大步向沼泽地走去时，韦斯莱先生说，“有时候，当一个人的记忆被修改时，他会暂时有点儿犯糊涂…况且他们想使他忘记的又是那么一件大事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走近放门钥匙的地方时，听见许多人在急切地吵吵嚷嚷；再走过去一点儿，他们发现，一大堆巫师把门钥匙管理员巴兹尔团团围住，都吵闹着要尽快离开营地。韦斯莱先生和巴兹尔三言两语地商量了一下，大家就站进队伍里，最后总算在太阳还没升起前领到了一只旧轮胎，可以靠它返回白鼬山了。在拂晓的微光中，他们穿过奥特里—圣卡奇波尔村，沿着湿漉漉的小路朝陋居走去。一路上大家很少说话，因为都累得要命，一心只想赶紧吃到早饭。他们转了个弯，陋居便赫然出现了，小路上传来一声喊叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family's names. There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. "Home, school and work" were there, but there was also "traveling, lost, hospital, prison," and in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, "mortal peril."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它有九根金针，每根针上都刻着韦斯莱家一个人的名字。钟面没有数字，却写着每位家庭成员可能会在的地方。有“家”、“学校”和“上班”，也有“路上”、“失踪”、“医院”、“监狱”，在普通钟上十二点的地方，标着“生命危险”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava. Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨点啪哒啪哒地打在客厅窗户上。赫敏专心地读着《标准咒语（四级）》，韦斯莱夫人在对角巷给她、哈利和罗恩各买了一本。查理在织补一个防火的套头帽兜。哈利在擦拭他的火弩箭，那本赫敏在他过十三岁生日时送给他的礼物《飞天扫帚护理手册》，现在打开了放在他脚边。弗雷德和乔治坐在那边的一个角落里，拿着羽毛笔，脑袋凑在一张羊皮纸上，低声谈论着什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote!" said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once. "If Dad hadn't said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented," said Bill, who was playing chess with Ron. "Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts' Charm Breakers once, and called me 'a long-haired pillock'?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都是斯基特那个讨厌的女人信笔胡写，你怎么敢因此责怪你爸爸呢！”韦斯莱夫人一下子就发火了，说道。“如果爸爸什么都不说，丽塔那老家伙又会评论魔法部的人一言不发，有失身分。”正在跟罗恩下棋的比尔说道，“丽塔·斯基特从来不写别人的好话。记得吗，她有一次采访了古灵阁的所有解咒员，然后管我叫‘长毛鬼’！”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Rita Skeeter's been ferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry mess-ups to report.

The rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic.

Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit -- he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him.</div>
