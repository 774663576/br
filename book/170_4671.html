<div class="line_en">She had not slept, could not sleep, would not sleep. She had not even dared to close her eyes, for fear it would be morning when she opened them again. If only she had the power, she would have made their nights go on forever, but the best that she could do was stay awake to try and savor every last sweet moment before daybreak turned them into no more than fading memories.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside her, Daario Naharis was sleeping as peacefully as a newborn babe. He had a gift for sleeping, he'd boasted, smiling in that cocksure way of his. In the field, he would sleep in the saddle oft as not, he claimed, so as to be well rested should he come upon a battle. Sun or storm, it made no matter. "A warrior who cannot sleep soon has no strength to fight," he said. He was never vexed by nightmares either. When Dany told him how Serwyn of the Mirror Shield was haunted by the ghosts of all the knights he'd killed, Daario only laughed. "If the ones I killed come bother me, I will kill them all again." He has a sellsword's conscience, she realized then. That is to say, none at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她身边，达里奥·纳哈里斯则像初生的婴儿一样酣睡。他会用一贯那种自信语气微笑着自夸，他有睡觉的天赋。在校场上他常能在马鞍上睡着，他称，这样到了战场上就又精力充沛了。烈日亦或风暴，全然无所谓。“一个无法立即入睡的战士是没有力量去战斗的，”他说。他也从不被噩梦困扰。当丹妮告诉他镜盾塞尔维因为他所杀的骑士们的鬼魂而饱受折磨时，达里奥只是笑笑。“要是我杀的人来打搅我，我就再把他们都杀一遍。”她于是知道，他有着雇佣骑士般的良心，或者干脆说，完全没有这种东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany ran her hand down his back, tracing the line of his spine. His skin was smooth beneath her touch, almost hairless. His skin is silk and satin. She loved the feel of him beneath her fingers. She loved to run her fingers through his hair, to knead the ache from his calves after a long day in the saddle, to cup his cock and feel it harden against her palm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮将手沿着他的脊骨拂过他的脊背，他的皮肤手感细滑如丝绸锦缎，绝少毛发。她爱在她指下的触感，爱将她的手指缠绕在他的发丝间，按摩因一天鞍马劳顿而疼痛的腓骨，环绕他的下身感受着它撑在掌间胀得坚挺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If she had been some ordinary woman, she would gladly have spent her whole life touching Daario, tracing his scars and making him tell her how he'd come by every one. I would give up my crown if he asked it of me, Dany thought… but he had not asked it, and never would. Daario might whisper words of love when the two of them were as one, but she knew it was the dragon queen he loved. If I gave up my crown, he would not want me. Besides, kings who lost their crowns oft lost their heads as well, and she could see no reason why it would be any different for a queen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="若她是什么平常女人，她会乐意将下半生都寄托在抚摸达里奥上，追寻他的伤疤，听着他诉说他是如何得到它们的。若他开口，我会放弃我的王冠，丹妮想…但是他从不也将永不开口。在他们缠绵为一体时，达里奥也许会在她耳边轻语情话，但她知道他爱的是龙之母。若我放弃王冠，他不会想要我的。另外，当国王丢失宝冠时，一同丢失的往往还有脑袋。她也不认为有什么理由能让女王逃过一劫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The candle flickered one last time and died, drowned in its own wax. Darkness swallowed the feather bed and its two occupants, and filled every corner of the chamber. Dany wrapped her arms around her captain and pressed herself against his back. She drank in the scent of him, savoring the warmth of his flesh, the feel of his skin against her own. Remember, she told herself. Remember how he felt. She kissed him on his shoulder.</div>

Daario had helped her to remember. I was dead and he brought me back to life. I was asleep and he woke me. My brave captain. Even so, of late he grew too bold. On the day that he returned from his latest sortie, he had tossed the head of a Yunkish lord at her feet and kissed her in the hall for all the world to see, until Barristan Selmy pulled the two of them apart.

<div class="line_en">That night her cooks roasted her a kid with dates and carrots, but Dany could only eat a bite of it. The prospect of wrestling with Meereen once more left her feeling weary. Sleep came hard, even when Daario came back, so drunk that he could hardly stand. Beneath her coverlets she tossed and turned, dreaming that Hizdahr was kissing her… but his lips were blue and bruised, and when he thrust himself inside her, his manhood was cold as ice. She sat up with her hair disheveled and the bed-clothes atangle. Her captain slept beside her, yet she was alone. She wanted to shake him, wake him, make him hold her, fuck her, help her forget, but she knew that if she did, he would only smile and yawn and say, "It was just a dream, my queen. Go back to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，她的厨师为她用枣子和胡萝卜烤了一只小山羊，但是丹妮只动了一口。与弥林人的角逐的展望又一次让她感到疲倦。即使达里奥回来，满嘴酒气几乎无法站立，她也很难睡着。床罩下，她辗转反侧，想象着希兹达尔吻着她…但他的唇蓝而淤青，而当他插入她时，他的男根冷如冰霜。她头发凌乱衣衫不整的坐起身，她的团长在她身边睡着，但是她依旧孤独。她想摇晃他，弄醒他，让他抱她，操她，让她忘却，但是她知道若她这么做，他指挥对她笑笑打个哈欠说，“那只是个梦，我的女王，回去好好睡觉吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her foes were all about her. There were never less than a dozen ships drawn up on the shore. Some days there were as many as a hundred, when the soldiers were disembarking. The Yunkai'i were even bringing in wood by sea. Behind their ditches, they were building catapults, scorpions, tall trebuchets. On still nights she could hear the hammers ringing through the warm, dry air. No siege towers, though. No battering rams. They would not try to take Meereen by storm. They would wait behind their siege lines, flinging stones at her until famine and disease had brought her people to their knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的仇敌对她紧追不放，数量从不必停靠于港湾的船至少。当士兵登陆的某些日子甚至多达一百。渊凯人甚至通过海路带来木材。在他们的渠后，他们正建造着弩炮，蝎子机，高高的投石机。在寂静的夜晚，她能听到温暖干燥的空气中传来锤声。但没有围攻高塔，没有攻城锤，他们不会通过猛攻取得弥林，他们会静守在围攻线后，对她投石头直到饥荒和疾病让她的人民臣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Side by side the queen's procession and Hizdahr zo Loraq's made their slow way across Meereen, until finally the Temple of the Graces loomed up before them, its golden domes flashing in the sun. How beautiful, the queen tried to tell herself, but inside her was some foolish little girl who could not help but look about for Daario. If he loved you, he would come and carry you off at swordpoint, as Rhaegar carried off his northern girl, the girl in her insisted, but the queen knew that was folly. Even if her captain was mad enough to attempt it, the Brazen Beasts would cut him down before he got within a hundred yards of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女王的队伍和希兹达尔·佐·洛拉克的肩并肩的慢慢穿过弥林，知道最后贤者庙隐现在他们面前，它金色的圆顶在阳光下闪闪发光。真美，女王试图这么说服自己，但她心中的傻女孩却不可遏制的想着达里奥。若他爱你，他会在剑授时刻将她带走，就像雷加带走那个北方女孩一样，她心中的小女孩坚持，但是女王知道那都是傻话。即使她的团长足够疯狂去付诸实施，黄铜野兽也会在他到达她百米外前就砍下他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Galazza Galare awaited them outside the temple doors, surrounded by her sisters in white and pink and red, blue and gold and purple. There are fewer than there were. Dany looked for Ezzara and did not see her. Has the bloody flux taken even her? Though the queen had let the Astapori starve outside her walls to keep the bloody flux from spreading, it was spreading nonetheless. Many had been stricken: freedmen, sellswords, Brazen Beasts, even Dothraki, though as yet none of the Unsullied had been touched. She prayed the worst was past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾拉扎·贾拉尔在庙门外等着他们，身边环绕着她身穿白粉红和蓝金紫的姐妹们。比以前的少了不少。丹尼想找到伊扎拉但是没看见。溶血病也带走了她吗？虽然女王留阿斯塔波人在墙外挨饿防止溶血病的传播，但它依旧在肆虐。很多人都被打倒了：自由人，雇佣剑士，黄铜野兽，甚至多斯拉克人，但即便如此，没有一个污垢者有事。她希望最坏的时刻已经过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Graces brought forth an ivory chair and a golden bowl. Holding her tokar daintily so as not to tread upon its fringes, Daenerys Targaryen eased herself onto the chair's plush velvet seat, and Hizdahr zo Loraq went to his knees, unlaced her sandals, and washed her feet whilst fifty eunuchs sang and ten thousand eyes looked on. He has gentle hands, she mused, as warm fragrant oils ran between her toes. If he has a gentle heart as well, I may grow fond of him in time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贤者们抬了一把象牙椅子与一个金色碗上前。讲究的抬着她的托克防止那些穗绊倒，丹妮莉丝·坦格利安在椅子舒适的天鹅绒座位上坐下，而希兹达尔·佐·洛拉克则跪下，解下她的凉鞋，在50个太监的歌声中与万双盐的注视下为她洗脚。他动作轻柔，香油在她的脚趾间流淌，这让她很高兴。若他也有颗温柔的心就好了，那我可能很快就会对他产生好感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When her feet were clean, Hizdahr dried them with a soft towel, laced her sandals on again, and helped her stand. Hand in hand, they followed the Green Grace inside the temple, where the air was thick with incense and the gods of Ghis stood cloaked in shadows in their alcoves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她的脚洗净，希兹达尔用软毛巾擦干它们，再系上她的凉鞋，助她站起来。手牵手的，让俺们追随者绿贤者们进到庙宇里，那里的空气有着厚重的焚香的气味，而吉斯的神灵们在他们的壁龛的阴影里伪装肃立。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Four hours later, they emerged again as man and wife, bound together wrist and ankle with chains of yellow gold.</div>
