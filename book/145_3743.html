<div class="line_en">'Transmit the viands!' called the young Emperor Pu Yi, imperiously. Dinner time was whenever he felt like eating, there were no fixed hours. 'Transmit the viands!' called the junior eunuchs to the other eunuchs standing in the main hall. The order passed like a Chinese whisper from eunuch to eunuch, until it finally reached the yu shan fang, the Imperial Viands Rooms, as the kitchens were called. The cooks leapt into action. Before long, the eunuchs, in procession, were scurrying towards the emperor's quarters with dozens of red lacquered food boxes painted with golden dragons, and the tables on which to serve them. There were no dining rooms in the palace, so they set the tables up wherever the emperor happened to be, six or seven of them: two for main dishes, another in winter for the various soups and stews that sat over flickering flames, one for cakes, one for rice, one for congees, and another for salted vegetables.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chinese emperors dined off yellow porcelain decorated with dragons, the imperial motif. There were strips of silver on the dishes, and silver chopsticks, because the metal was known to discolour in the presence of poison. (This was just a final precaution, because each dish had already been tasted by one of the eunuchs, who was watched carefully for signs of sickness before the emperor was fed.) The last emperor, Pu Yi, was presented with a mere thirty dishes at a sitting; the Empress Dowager Longyu, dining in her own quarters, with a hundred. The emperor ate alone, scrutinised by the eunuch servants. Whatever he had really eaten, their report to the senior concubines would be the same, dictated by ritual: 'The Lord of Ten Thousand Years consumed one bowl of old-rice viands (or white-rice viands), one steamed breadroll (or a griddle cake), and a bowl of congee. He consumed it with relish.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Although I had been travelling in China for many years, I had never spent much time in the great northern capital, Beijing. I passed through every couple of years on my way to somewhere else, meeting up with journalist friends and eating the odd Peking duck, but I can't say I really knew the city. So, eager to move beyond Hunan and to broaden my culinary horizons, I spent a few weeks there after Christmas one year, researching Chinese imperial cooking.</div>

<div class="line_en">These days the Forbidden City is just a museum. Pu Yi abdicated in 1912, at the tender age of five, when Republican forces had overthrown the Chinese imperial system after more than two thuousand years. Yet, under a bizarre agreement with the new government, he remained in the palace with the wife and senior concubines of his predecessor, and a vast staff of eunuchs, for a further thirteen years, until he was evicted by the warlord Feng Yuxiang's National Army in 1924. During that time, his life continued in all its pomp and ceremony, but his power ended abruptly at the dark-red perimeter walls. After the communist takeover of China in 1949, the palace was maintained as a museum and some of its workers lived within its confines, but later they too were shunted out, because of the risk of fire. Now, when the gates close at night, the citadel known as the Great Within (da nei) is deserted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Central Beijing in January is magnificent, with its wide boulevards, stately architecture, and imperial yellow tiles glistening in the pale midwinter sun. At its heart lies the Forbidden City, which is being repainted and refurbished after years of neglect. Parts of it have been restored to gleaming splendour, but in the rest the paint is peeling, and the courtyards are worn and tufted with weeds. I sat, one bright morning, on the steps leading down towards the Inner Court, with the Last Emperor's autobiography in my hands, trying to imagine the smoke rising from the chimneys of the Imperial kitchens; the processions of eunuchs, their feet padding along the drafty colonnades; and the young emperor Pu Yi, surrounded always by his suffocating retinue of staff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一月的老北京城是相当宏伟的：宽阔的大道，庄严的建筑，象征天子威严的黄色琉璃瓦在冷冷的隆冬阳光下闪烁着。老北京城的心脏地带就是紫禁城，多年疏于维护之后，现在有人对其进行修复，重新上漆，翻修一些地方：有部分已经完成修复，金碧辉煌、光彩壮丽；但还没修复的那部分则墙漆斑驳、院落颓败、荒草丛生。一个晴朗的早上，我坐在通往内宫的台阶上，手上拿着末代皇帝的自传，试着去想象：炊烟从御膳房的烟囱袅袅升起；太监们列队小跑，无数双脚在柱廊之间引起一阵风；还有年轻的皇帝溥仪，像往常一样前呼后拥，被乌泱泱的仆人围绕着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In theory, Pu Yi might have been blessed with the finest of diets. Imperial Beijing, after all, as the more-or-less continuous Chinese capital for 600 years, should have been one of the best places in the world to eat. The sumptuous cuisine of north-eastern Shandong Province, once the home region of Confucius, formed the bedrock of palace cooking. It was grandiose in style, with its fine stocks, rich soups and liberal use of fiendishly expensive ingredients. But it was always augmented by the tastes and techniques of other regions. When, during the Ming Dynasty, the Yongle Emperor moved his capital north to Beijing in 1403, the flood of officials who accompanied him brought with them chefs well versed in the kitchen lore of Nanjing, the old southern capital. During the Qing Dynasty, the Qianlong Emperor enjoyed lengthy sojourns in the southern Yangtze region, where he was seduced by the region's luxurious ways and fine gastronomy. He brought back with him chefs from centres of fine-dining like Yangzhou, who wove their own recipes into the imperial menus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理论上，溥仪大概是最有口福的人。毕竟，天子所在的北京，六百年来基本上都是帝都，那必须是汇集天下美味的地方。从孔夫子家乡、北京东南方向的山东省传过来的奢华鲁菜成为宫廷菜的基石。鲁菜从风格上便是富丽堂皇的：悉心熬煮的高汤，浓郁的汤菜，穷奢极欲地肆意使用昂贵的食材。不过，宫廷菜也会利用其他地区的味道与烹饪技巧对鲁菜加以改良发展。一四零三年，明朝的永乐皇帝把都城北迁到北京，大批的官员跟随他北上，也带着他们自己的厨子，都是旧都南京厨界的精英。清朝的乾隆皇帝很喜欢长时间地微服出巡江南，那里浮华精致的生活与妙不可言的美食时时都在诱惑着他。他从苏州这类高级餐饮的中心带了些厨子回紫禁城，厨子们就把自己的菜谱写进了御膳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Into Beijing's melting pot of regional and ethnic foodways poured the finest produce from every corner of the empire. Tealeaves came in tribute from the hills of Zhejiang and Yunnan in the appropriate seasons; candied ginger from Yangzhou; Sichuan pepper from Qingxi in western Sichuan; and exotic delicacies like dried mushrooms and seafood ('treasures from the mountains and the seas') from far and wide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="北京就像个大熔炉，融合了各个地区与各个民族的饮食文化与顶级特产。浙江与云南的茶山会在应季时供奉上好的茶叶，扬州送来美味的姜糖，四川西部清溪供上最香的花椒，还有四面八方远道而来、特别少见的干菇与干海鲜（所谓“山珍海味”）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Qing emperors were Manchus from the northeast, not Han Chinese. Their ancestors had been nomads, eaters of bread and mutton, nibblers of pastries and candied fruits that were easy to transport on horseback across the northern grasslands. They drank milky tea, like the Tibetans and Mongols. After their conquest of China in 1644, the Qing ruling class never entirely lost their taste for such barbarian fare, and ensured that roast meats and certain sweet pastries became part of the repertoire of palace cooks. They also introduced Manchu dining customs, combining them with the more delicate eating habits of the Han Chinese: they carried knives in sheaths that had a pocket for chopsticks, so they could slice off chunks of meat and then eat them in the Chinese fashion. The blending of Han and Manchu culinary cultures at court reached its peak in the 'Man-Han' imperial banquet, a legendary three-day extravaganza of feasting that is said to have included more than 200 different dishes and snacks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清朝的皇帝都不是汉人，而是来自东北的满人。他们的祖先是游牧民族，吃馒头、啃羊肉，偏爱方便带在马背上穿越北边大草原的点心和果脯。他们和西藏人、蒙古人一样，爱喝酥油茶。一六四四年清朝建立以来，统治阶级还一直保留着对“蛮荒”食物的口味，把一些烤肉与甜味点心送上了宫廷菜的保留名单。他们还引进了满族进食的习俗，和汉族那种更为精巧讲究的进食习惯结合起来：满人的靴子上都有个小袋子，里面既装刀子又装筷子，这样大块的肉上来时，就可以拿刀割下一片，然后按照汉族人的样子用筷子夹着吃。汉族和满族饮食文化在宫廷里融合的高峰就是“满汉全席”，这是非常传奇的三日豪宴，据说有两百多道不同的菜肴和小吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The emperor himself normally took two main meals a day: breakfast early in the morning, and the so-called 'evening viands' at around one o'clock. And then at six in the evening or thereabouts, he had an 'evening snack'. Every menu had to be formally approved by the Imperial Household Department before it could be cooked, and each was filed afterwards in the palace archives. (One, dating back to the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor records, for a day in 1799, a light breakfast served to the emperor's father at the start of the Lunar Year. It lists more than forty dishes, including soups made from bird's nest, duck, chicken, deer's tail and pork, vegetables, little steamed buns, New Year's cake, and 'all kinds of pastries and snacks'.) While the main Imperial kitchens supplied the emperor's grand daily provisions, smaller tea-kitchens provided informal refreshments, and pastry kitchens were at hand for buns and cakes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皇上本人一天主要吃两顿：大上午的早膳和下午一点左右所谓的“晚膳”。到傍晚六点左右，他会吃个“晚点”（晚上的点心）。上灶开火之前，每顿的菜单都必须通过内务府的审批，吃完后每顿的菜肴都要记录到宫廷档案当中。（嘉庆皇帝时期的档案中记录了一七九九年的一顿比较简单的早膳，是农历大年初一呈给太上皇的，上面列出了四十多道菜，包括燕窝汤、鸡、鸭、鹿尾、猪肉、蔬菜、小笼包、年糕以及“各样点心”。）御膳房负责皇上每日可观的吃食，底下还有分工明确的小厨房，比如御茶房提供非正餐时间的小吃点心，饽饽房则负责包子、馒头、糕点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside the palace, civil servants from all over China, working on rotation in Beijing and elsewhere, kept grand official residences. Highly educated, and often with discerning palates, they developed their tastes as they travelled, and goaded their private chefs to innovate at the stove. And so evolved a number of individual culinary styles that blended the flavours and cooking arts of different regions: some of them became so well known that they have survived until the present day, like the Tan Family Cuisine (tan jia cai) served in a restaurant of that name in the Beijing Hotel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出了宫，还有全中国轮职的公务官员。他们有时候在北京，有时候被派遣到地方，都拥有豪华宽大的宅邸。这些人通常都受过良好的教育，味蕾也是相当挑剔，轮职各地的过程中，他们的口味不断变化，并命令自己的私厨创新进步。于是乎，融合了各个地区味道与烹饪艺术的私家菜系应运而生：有些菜系名扬天下，一直传承延续到今天，比如北京饭店有家“谭家菜馆”，做的就是“谭家菜”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes the grand eating habits of the palace spilled out into the life of the common people. It was ex-palace chefs of Shandong origin, for example, who joined a man named Yang Quanren in setting up a roast-duck venture in Beijing in 1864. Roast duck had been around for centuries, but the traditional way of making it was in a covered oven (men lu) with a fire beneath it. Yang introduced the people of the capital to the roasting techniques of the palace kitchens, in which the birds were suspended over a fruitwood fire that gave their skin the most delectable crispness. His restaurant, Quanjude, became a national institution, and gave the world Peking Duck as we know it today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，宫里穷奢极欲的饮食习惯也会扩展到平民生活中。比如一八六四年，宫外一些来自山东的厨师和一个叫杨全仁的人一起开了家烤鸭店。烤鸭作为一道菜已经存在了好几个世纪，但传统做法是把鸭子放进一只焖炉，下面烧着火来烤。而杨全仁把御膳房的烘烤技术介绍给了京城百姓：果木烧火、鸭子挂炉，这样烤出来的鸭皮更脆、更美味。他这家叫做“全聚德”的烤鸭店成为国家的标杆，今日扬名世界的“北京烤鸭”就出自这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the emperor's daily meals were lavish, state banquets were arranged on an improbable scale: at the inaugural feast of the Jiaqing Emperor, for example, the kitchens laid on 1550 hotpots. When the British government first attempted to make contact with the Chinese court in 1793, the Qianlong Emperor entertained the British envoy Lord Macartney and his party to a 'sumptuous banquet'. Small tables, one for every two guests, were stacked with a 'pyramid of dishes or bowls piled upon each other, containing viands and fruits in vast variety'. The serving and removing of the dinner was conducted with such silence and solemnity that the Englishmen likened it to 'the celebration of a religious mystery'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说皇上的日常饮食已经算铺张浪费，那国宴的规模就是常人难以想象的了，比如嘉庆皇帝的登基大宴上，御膳房端出了一千五百五十只火锅。一七九三年，英国政府初次与中国朝廷联系，乾隆皇帝为英国使臣马嘎尔尼伯爵及其代表安排了“豪宴”。每两位客人坐一张小桌，上面摆满了“盘子和碗，一层又一层地堆叠起来，装着各式各样的食物和水果”。不管上菜还是撤菜，气氛都威严肃穆，在场的英国人将其比作“神秘的宗教仪式”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That January in Beijing, I set myself a mission to find the old kitchens of the Forbidden City. Several times I went there, buying my ticket at a booth in the outer courtyard, walking through one of the inner gates, a mousehole at the foot of towering red walls. I spent my first few visits exploring the grand halls, losing myself in the limitless lanes and the vast, abandoned courtyards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年一月在北京，我赋予了自己一项使命，就是去寻找紫禁城旧时的老厨房。我去了很多次。在午门外买了门票，走过某一重宫门：在高高的红墙之下，这门看着就像个老鼠洞。头几次去，我几乎都在探索宏伟的大殿，那无数的长街通衢、那寂寂无人的宽大院落，让我流连、让我迷失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The imperial kitchens were marked on my map as lying just to the east of the Outer Court, but when I eventually found them -- two long buildings with tiled rooves -- they lay in forbidden parts of the Forbidden City, closed to visitors. After a while, my curiosity overcame me, and I ignored the signs and slipped through a gate. The guards either didn't see me or turned a blind eye. In the end, however, the kitchens were still unreachable in their locked, walled compound. I stole through an open door into a neighbouring building that was filled with steam and fantastical pipes, the nerve centre of an old-fashioned central-heating system, but there was no way through. Walking deeper into the private office areas of the Palace Museum, I fell into conversation with a member of staff, and before long found myself drinking tea with a friendly and knowledgeable expert on the Forbidden City named Professor Luo. His office, at the side of a traditional courtyard, was stacked messily with books and periodicals.</div>

The formidable Empress Dowager Cixi, who had ruled at court since 1898, had suddenly decided to make him heir to the throne as she lay on her deathbed in November. So the young boy was wrenched, howling, from his family and installed in lonely splendour in the Forbidden City.</div>

<div class="line_en">We talked for a while about imperial dining habits, and then, in an act of spontaneous kindness, he took me on a tour of the imperial collections in the museum. We saw the ritual bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, patterned with stylised beasts and birds; the heavy jars that were once filled with grain and sealed into tombs; the delicate white ceramics of the Sui. We walked through galleries that explained the ritual of imperial wedding feasts. Most intriguingly, Professor Luo told me that some of the palace storerooms had never been cleared, and were still filled with dried foodstuffs and medicinal herbs from the early twentieth century, when the Last Emperor still lived within its walls.</div>

<div class="line_en">In his autobiography, Pu Yi condemned the excesses of the old imperial court, and said the Republican government had allowed him and his household to continue 'our prodigious waste of the sweat and blood of the people in order to maintain our former pomp and continue our parasitic way of life'. But he wrote his autobiography under communist supervision, and the communists clearly wanted to play up the wasteful extravagance of the Qing and the Republicans who succeeded them.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just the start of a strange and turbulent life. Pu Yi ruled, with his father as regent, for barely three years before his abdication in 1912. When, at the age of eighteen, he was rudely expelled from the palace, having continued to live there until then under the terms of his abdication agreement, he took refuge in the Japanese concession in Tianjin. In 1934 he became the puppet emperor of the Japanese vassal state of Manchukuo in northern Manchuria -- an ill-fated collaboration that led to his being branded a war criminal at the end of the Second World War. Following the armistice, he spent five years in a Siberian prison, and then travelled back to China by train in 1950, where he was imprisoned for another decade in an attempt to 'reform' him through labour and ideological indoctrination. In 1959, Pu Yi was formally pardoned by the communist state, and spent the rest of his life as an ordinary citizen in Beijing, working as a gardener and, later, a researcher in the imperial archives.</div>

<div class="line_en">After my tour of the palace museum with Professor Luo, fantasising about deer's tail soup for breakfast, I became more and more hungry. But I couldn't find anything to eat. The chimneys rising from the old tea kitchens were cold, the imperial kitchens boarded up and empty, and there weren't even any modern snack bars for the tourists. In the end, my energy fading, I came across a few tables and chairs set up outside the hatch of some kind of stall. I laid down my heavy bag. Through a gate in the dark-red walls, I could see the end of the old imperial kitchens. But the only hot food being sold on that freezing January afternoon was pot noodles, cooked in water poured from a thermos flask. So I sat down with my lists of imperial delicacies, and my books about the lives of the emperors, and ate instant noodles with beef-flavoured sauce out of a disposable plastic bowl.</div>

<div class="line_en">But was it even necessary to exaggerate? Pu Yi quotes the imperial records of food expenditure for a single month of his reign, when he was a mere four years old. Apparently, the tiny emperor, the empress dowager and four high consorts together consumed about two tonnes of meat and 388 chickens and ducks in that month alone, of which about 400 kilogrammes of pork and 240 chickens and ducks were destined for the emperor himself. That's about 14 kilogrammes of meat and nine birds every day, for a tiny child! Even in my wildest and most excessive periods of 'research' in China, I haven't come close to this. Needless to say, most of this extraordinary food budget must have been wasted, or siphoned off by the eunuchs, who were notorious for their embezzlement of imperial funds.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, when I was visiting the National Palace Museum in Taipei, I came across a rather peculiar exhibit. There, in a glazed display cabinet, on a delicate plinth tooled with cloud patterns in pure gold, sat what appeared to be a chunk of tender cooked pork. The skin was a rich, glossy brown, flecked with the dots of hair follicles. The flesh, layered unevenly with fat, drooped succulently over one edge of the plinth. It looked delicious, like a piece of belly pork that had been braised for hours in a clay pot with soy sauce, rice wine and sugar. My mouth watered… but the label on the cabinet was a stony reminder that the 'meat' was made from a piece of cold, hard agate.</div>

<div class="line_en">This pork chunk is one of the most prized imperial treasures, spirited away from the Forbidden City when China was consumed by war. The Nationalist authorities loaded their pick of the precious objects in the palace onto a convoy of lorries, and drove them deep into the Chinese hinterland. As battle raged around them, and Japanese bombs fell, the custodians of the museum skirted the areas where the fighting was worst, and ultimately shipped their cargo over the straits to Taiwan, where the Nationalists were setting up their exile government. Incredibly, not a single object was damaged or broken in the course of this long and tempestuous journey.</div>

<div class="line_en">In ancient China, food was not only a pleasure but a grave matter and one of the main concerns of government. Edible sacrifices made to gods and ancestors sustained the social and political order: neglect them, and chaos would surely follow. That was why the Zhou Court of the first millennium BC, according to later historians, assigned more than half its staff, or two thousand people, to matters related to food and drink. There were dieticians and chefs; game hunters and butchers; meat-dryers and turtle-catchers; picklers and icehouse attendants. Some were responsible for preparing sacrificial offerings, others for feeding the king and his consorts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在古代中国，食物不仅是享受，还是万分重大的事情，也是政府最关心的民生社稷之一。为神仙与祖先献上可以吃的祭品，是维持社会与政治秩序的必须，若忽略了这种礼仪，则一定会天下大乱。所以，根据史学家研究，公元前一千年的周朝，就有超过一半（多达两千人）朝廷官员的职责是饮食相关的，其中有食医和烹人、兽人（打猎）和庖人（屠夫）、腊人（做腊肉）和鳖人（抓鳖）、醯人（制醋酿酒）和凌人（看管冰窖）；有些负责准备祭祀用品，还有的负责满足皇亲国戚们的口腹之欲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Political power was symbolised by the ding, a cauldron used for cooking meat for sacrifices. In the distant reaches of Chinese history, the number of ding a nobleman was allowed to possess depended on his rank. Steal a man's ding in a military campaign, and you took away his lordly authority. The ceremonial ding themselves, cast in bronze, covered in geometric patterns, were at the heart of ritual life. These distinctive cooking pots are still one of the most potent symbols of Chinese civilisation: the Shanghai museum that opened with a great fanfare in 1996 takes the form of a ding.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sages often compared the art of government to seasoning a stew. You had to balance the different flavours, the vinegar and pickled meats, the salt and sour plums, to achieve perfect harmony. 'The cook blends the ingredients,' said the statesman Yanzi in a text compiled more than 2000 years ago, 'and equalises them by taste, adding whatever is deficient and decreasing whatever is excessive. His master then eats it and thereby composes his mind. The relationship between lord and vassal also is like this…'</div>

<div class="line_en">Others offered serious advice in culinary terms. The Taoist philosopher Laozi, author of the Tao Te Ching, warned that governing a state was as delicate a matter as cooking small fish, while Confucius, who lived in the fifth century BC, was as cultivated in his eating habits as he was in other aspects of his life: 'his rice is not excessively refined, and his sliced meat is not cut excessively fine. Rice that has become putrid and sour, fish that has spoiled, and meat that has gone bad, he does not eat. Undercooked foods he does not eat, and foods served at improper times he does not eat. Meat that is improperly carved, he does not eat, and if he does not obtain the proper sauce, he will not eat.'

This was the most solemn religious ceremony of the year. A bullcalf, a sheep, a pig and a deer were killed in the sacred abbatoir of the Temple of Heaven in the southeast of Beijing.

<div class="line_en">Fangshan specialises in Chinese imperial cuisine, with an emphasis on dishes derived from the repertoire of the great Man-Han banquet. When Pu Yi left the Forbidden City, four or five of the former palace chefs opened this restaurant, then on the northern edge of the lake in Beihai Park, on the advice of a former palace eunuch, Zhao Renzhai. 'There were no recipe books in those days, and most chefs were illiterate,' the manager Wang Tao told us, 'so all their skills were passed from generation to generation by word of mouth. During the Cultural Revolution, for about ten years, this place was not open to the general public, although it continued to serve political insiders; later it was opened to important state guests; and finally in 1989 to the public once again. So although the original chefs were all dead by the sixties, we have an unbroken chain of teaching and tradition that extends right back to the Forbidden City.'</div>

There were small blocks of a paste made from peas, subtly sweetened and ice-cold on the tongue; and slices of a roll made from sugared haricot beans stuffed with red-bean paste and crushed sesame seeds; cold meats and vegetables. Naturally, we were then offered a parade of showy delicacies: shark's fin soup, slices of gelatinous camel's foot in a dark, velvety sauce; soft-shelled turtle; sea cucumber and abalone. Some of the snacks were of particular imperial interest, like the small sesame flatbreads with a minced-pork stuffing. The Empress Dowager Cixi is said to have dreamt of these one night, only to find them served for breakfast the following morning, to her delight. Cixi is also associated with small steamed cones of maize flour: she was given these wo tou by a peasant when she fled to Xi'an after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, and enjoyed them so much that her cooks recreated them in a more elegant fashion on her return to Beijing.</div>

We emerged at the end of the evening lost in yellow, well-fed, and rather enchanted with the whole palace dining experience. But of course I was aware that the dishes at Fangshan bore as much relation to the real foodways of Beijing as the menu of a restaurant with three Michelin stars does to the diet of a dustman in Peckham. And while I was in the capital, I wanted to experience the local food at its grittiest. The secretary of the Chinese Culinary Association had told me that, if I really wanted to taste the city's street food, I should try lu zhu huo shao, which loosely translates as 'flatbread in broth'.

Most ghastly of all was the proud centrepiece of the feast, lu zhu huo shao, which one of my Chinese food books renders in English as 'Boiled pig's entrails with cake bits'. Beads of oil quivered like sweat on the surface of a dismal broth that was a casket of animal extremities: chunks of purplish pig's lung, pale tubes poking out of their sponginess; pieces of stomach and liver; slices of wobbly intestine… A fetid aroma emanated from the squashy tubes and chambers.

<div class="line_en">But Pu Yi says in his autobiography that he never touched the food from the main imperial kitchens. Those thirty dishes had all been prepared long in advance, since they had to be ready to be whisked into the imperial presence at a moment's notice. They had sat around for hours on the stoves, sagging. According to Pu Yi, the eunuchs set up these official meals some distance away from him, where presumably the fats in the thirty dishes congealed, the soups grew cold, the vegetables wilted, and the pastries staled in the open air. Some of the dishes may even have been fake: one of my sources in Beijing told me wooden roast chickens and other models were used to heighten the impression of plenty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the young emperor actually ate from a quite separate selection of dishes produced in the Dowager Empress Longyu's own private kitchen. Like the eunuchs, many of whom had their own catering arrangements, she knew better than to trust the central palace kitchens. The chief imperial cooks, according to Pu Yi, were aware that their food had not been eaten for more than a decade, since the reign of his predecessor Guangxu. Did they even care how it tasted? The food Pu Yi ordered the cooks to send to the High Consorts on their birthdays was, he says, 'expensive and showy without being good… neither nutritious nor tasty.' One can imagine the apathy, the creeping negligence of the chefs, after years of producing these untouched feasts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而年轻的皇帝真正吃的，是隆裕太后寝宫膳房里做出来的菜。连太监们都知道去别处寻摸好吃的，隆裕太后自然也是不信任御膳房的。溥仪说，御膳房的厨子们也是知道的，从光绪皇帝起的十几年来，他们做的东西早就没人吃了。他们到底还在不在意这些菜味道如何呢？溥仪说，每到年节或太妃的生日，他命令厨子们做给太妃的菜肴可以用四句话予以鉴定：“华而不实，费而不惠，营而不养，淡而无味。”应该可以想象，多年来做的都是没人碰、没人吃的菜肴，厨师们该变得多冷漠、多不在意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The grand state banquets can have been little better. Think of food cooked in enormous cauldrons, on a vast scale, and then transported long distances across lanes and courtyards, before being laid out in front of state guests seated according to a rigid hierarchy in the drafty halls. Imagine the endless toasts, the stifling ritual. How cold and dreary the food must have become. Sometimes, it's true, they set up chafing dishes to keep some of it warm. But it was all show food, fusty and bombastic, a pageant of expensive delicacies to flaunt the wealth of the Chinese empire.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wondered if anyone had really enjoyed their meals in the Forbidden City. It is a solemn, intimidating place, especially in winter, its beauty austere. From outside, you see only roofs and watchtowers, bounded by faceless walls and a wide, frozen moat. It looks more prison than palace, forbidding as well as forbidden. The hearts of the newly selected imperial concubines must have sunk as its gates clanged shut behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道紫禁城到底有没有人真正享受过美食。这个地方太过庄严肃穆，令人望而生畏；尤其是在冬日里，这里的美就更显得冷峻起来。从外面你只能看到殿宇的屋顶和角楼，围着一圈冰冷漠然的墙壁和一条宽阔封冻的护城河。看着不像宫殿，倒像监狱，既禁入又禁出。那巨大的宫门在身后轰隆关上的一刻，新选入宫为妃为嫔的秀女们一定是心里一沉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The diets of the concubines were strictly regulated, like everything else in their lives. They were graded by rank: in the Qing period, first below the empress was the imperial consort, then there were two high consorts and four ordinary consorts, eight so-called gui ren (another lower rank of consort), and any number of lesser concubines. They were only allowed to eat really well when, or if, they fell pregnant, because it was thought that in normal circumstances a rich diet would breed lustful thoughts. So at other times they were assigned quotas of meat, poultry, vegetables and grain foods according to their status. The imperial consort, for example, might get 12 jin (about 6 kilogrammes) of pork and ten aubergines a month, and a chicken or duck every day; but a woman at the bottom of the heap would be given only six jin of pork and six aubergines, and a mere ten birds every month. (Imagine the bickering, the bitchiness, as the top concubine savoured her piece of succulent pork at the end of the month, while lesser concubines were left with vegetables and beancurd!) The chance to eat more richly would have been just another incentive to get pregnant, an achievement that might enable a low-ranking concubine to rise up the sexual pecking order: a secondary concubine who produced a son might even end up as empress dowager, like the formidable Cixi.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和宫内生活的方方面面一样，妃嫔们的膳食也是有严格规定的，主要按照位份品级来定。清朝时，皇后下面是皇贵妃，然后是两个贵妃、四个后妃、六个嫔、八个贵人，剩下的低阶侍妾数量随意。她们唯一能真正吃得好的时候，只能是怀了龙胎。因为当时普遍认为，在平常的日子里，饱暖思淫欲，所以没有怀孕的妃嫔，肉、禽类、蔬菜和谷物都是根据地位来定的。比如，皇贵妃每月大概能分到十二斤猪肉和十个茄子，每天能有一只鸡或鸭；但最底层的侍妾每月就只有六斤猪肉、六个茄子和十只禽类。（想想看吧，到月底，位份最高的妃子津津有味地品尝着她那肥美多汁的猪肉，而低阶侍妾们只能靠青菜豆腐过日子，这该引起多么激烈的争吵和嫉妒啊！）吃得更好、更丰富，也是妃子们削尖脑袋要怀孕的动力之一。只要怀了龙胎，身份低微的侍妾也可能在这属于女人们的等级制度中节节高升；要是生了儿子，地位不高的妃子最后说不定就是太后，比如垂帘听政、独揽大权的慈禧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Supposedly, the emperor could have eaten anything and everything. The world was his abalone, in a golden shell. Yet, as a child, Pu Yi had no appetite. He was taken from his mother before he was three, and the grandmother who had doted on him had a breakdown when he left. He didn't see either of them again for seven years, and his father only visited him for a couple of minutes every two months. Eventually his mother committed suicide, with an overdose of opium. His wet-nurse was the only person who awakened in him feelings of empathy for other human beings, and she was dismissed when he was eight years old. The high consorts of the two previous emperors officially became his 'mothers' when he was adopted into the palace, but it was a formal relationship and he says he never knew any motherly love. The heart of the empire was a cold-hearted place. Starved of affection, Pu Yi developed a stomach ailment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想来皇帝应该吃遍天下美食奇珍，整个世界都像他筷子下包裹着金壳子的一块鲍鱼。然而，小时候的溥仪一点胃口也没有。三岁就被迫和母亲分离，那时视他为掌上明珠的祖母精神崩溃、一病不起。此后的七年里，无论是妈妈还是奶奶，小溥仪都没再见过。父亲也是每两个月才来跟他相见几分钟。最终，生母吸食过量鸦片自杀。只有乳母，唤醒了他的人性，让他为别人有所考虑。而太妃们背着他把这位乳母赶出去的时候，溥仪才八九岁。被收养到宫里之后，两位先帝（同治和光绪）的妃子成了他官方的“母亲”，但这关系是非常正式刻板的，他说自己并没有得到过真正的母爱。帝国的心脏，却是一个冷漠的冰窖。从没被关爱“喂饱”过的溥仪，得了胃病。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Life in the palace was ridden with filthy intrigue, whoever you were. Even emperors could be its victims, like Pu Yi's predecessor Guangxu, who was humiliated and imprisoned by the Empress Dowager Cixi after a virtual coup d'etat, and who later died in suspicious circumstances. Many of Cixi's enemies came to sticky ends: suicide, decapitation, imprisonment and exile. She disliked one of her daughters-in-law so much she deprived her of food and drink until she died, had one imperial consort drowned in a well, and was also suspected of poisoning a rival dowager empress with some tainted soup. At one point, Pu Yi himself was so terrified of being murdered that he was unable to sleep, and he says in his autobiography that theft, arson, murder, gambling and opium-smoking were common within the palace walls.</div>

<div class="line_en">It probably wasn't just a lack of love that contributed to his digestive problems. Pu Yi's diet was tightly controlled, because the health of the emperor was paramount. 'Your Majesty's body is a sacred body,' Pu Yi remembers his mother telling him when she finally did visit him in the palace. And as Professor Luo explained to me, when we met for tea one day in a café just outside the Forbidden City, 'in those days they thought fever was a symptom of inner fire, which would be exacerbated by the consumption of rich and highly seasoned food. So whenever children in the imperial family fell sick, they were given only congee to eat, to cool them down. Of course such a diet was inadequate, and many of them, over the years, actually died of malnutrition.' Pu Yi himself describes how once 'I stuffed myself with chestnuts, and for a month or more afterwards the empress dowager… only allowed me to eat browned rice porridge; and although I was crying with hunger, no one paid me any attention.' He was so desperate to eat, he says, that he snatched a little cold pork that some princes had sent in tribute to the empress dowager, to the fury of his minders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，缺爱大概并非胃病的唯一原因。溥仪的饮食是受到严格控制的，因为天子的健康是重中之重。“皇帝的身子是圣体。”溥仪记得母亲终于到宫里看自己的时候，嘱咐了这么一句话。有天我和李老师约在紫禁城外喝茶，他向我解释说：“那时候他们觉得发烧是心里有火，要是吃了营养丰富和加工过多的食物，心火就烧得更旺。所以皇家的孩子要是生病了，就只能喝粥，好败败心火。当然光吃粥怎么够呢，这么多年，很多孩子其实就是营养不良死掉的。”溥仪自己也在书里写道：“我六岁时有一次栗子吃多了，撑着了，有一个多月的时间隆裕太后只许我吃糊米粥，我天天嚷肚子饿也没有人管。”他说，自己饿到抢吃抢喝的地步，有一天把某王府给太后上贡的冷酱肘子抓起一只就咬，结果跟随的太监大惊失色，连忙来抢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With Pu Yi, they didn't have to worry. Professor Luo, sipping his jasmine tea in the café, lowered his voice as he told me that the last emperor was impotent. 'One of my grandmother's closest friends was his concubine,' he told me, 'and she wrote many letters to my grandmother. In them she said how lonely and miserable she was, and made veiled allusions to the emperor's incapacities. Of course no one could speak of this openly, but his lack of "face" made him bitter and tormented, and he mistreated his wives.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于溥仪，他们是不必有这方面顾虑的。李老师一边喝着茉莉花茶，一边压低声音告诉我，这位末代皇帝有阳痿的毛病。“我奶奶有个好朋友，是他的侍妾，”他对我说，“她给我奶奶写了好多信。信里说，她特别孤独，心情不好，还特别隐晦地说了皇上不行的事儿。当然不会有人把这事儿拿出来公开宣扬，但他因为这事儿觉得没脸啊，心里不好受，性格很坏，对妻妾们都不好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pu Yi's sexual life was no more successful than his gastronomic life. Of course he was provided with a wife and concubine when he came of age (a mere two 'dishes', compared with the hundreds of some of his predecessors). Later, he took another consort and another wife. But sex for an emperor wasn't meant to be enjoyable, any more than dinner. The Chinese have long memories, and no one had forgotten the dissipated life of the Xuanzong Emperor of the eighth-century Tang. He fell badly in love with his favourite concubine, Yang Guifei, and when his reign collapsed after a bloody rebellion, his romantic infatuation was blamed. After that, the sexual lives of the emperors were strictly regulated. Bedmates were not allowed to stay the night, lest they exhaust the Son of Heaven. Whispering eunuchs kept an eye on things, to make sure no dangerous attachments developed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="溥仪的性生活也不比饮食生活幸福。自然，到了年龄，宫里也给他婚配了一后一妃（就给他上了这么两道“菜”，而先帝们却有三宫六院、数百佳丽）。后来，他又纳了两个妃子。但皇上的性生活注定和用膳一样，不会快活。中国人记性好，忘不了八世纪唐玄宗沉迷酒色的奢侈生活。他深爱杨贵妃，而一场血腥起义导致皇权岌岌可危后，很多人把这祸水归于他痴迷的爱情。那之后，皇帝的性生活就受到严格的制约和管束：妃嫔可以上床，但不可过夜，唯恐把天子给累着了。总有太监注视着他们的一举一动，窃窃私语地传话，确保皇帝和妃嫔之间不会产生危险的情感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the emperor's duty to feed the people, but his own personal appetites were irrelevant. 'Appetite for food and sex is nature,' the philosopher Gaozi once said. But the emperor wasn't an ordinary man, he was the Son of Heaven, and for him food and sex were political events. Eunuchs watched him eat, and they waited by his bedroom door. All in all, the last emperor was a pitiful figure. Like his ancient imperial predecessor, Shi Huang Di of terracotta-army fame, he was incarcerated in an opulent tomb, provided with endless servants, riches beyond imagining, and every delicacy in the empire. The difference was that, when he was incarcerated, Pu Yi was still alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皇帝要填饱天下万民的肚子，但他自己的胃口是不相干的。“食、色，性也。”哲学家告子曾经说过。但皇帝不是普通人，他是天子，他的饮食与性生活都是政治事件。吃饭的时候，有太监在一旁看着；床笫之欢的时候，太监就在卧房门外守着。观其一生，末代皇帝令人同情唏嘘。和自己古老的始祖、创设了著名兵马俑的秦始皇一样，他也被监禁在一个财物丰裕的“坟墓”里，有无数的仆从，享尽荣华富贵，帝国的珍馐佳肴任他享用。不同的是，溥仪被困“坟墓”中时，还活着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pu Yi himself confessed to a 'taste for cruelty' in his autobiography, and wrote that he abandoned his new empress on their wedding night in 1922 because he preferred to sleep alone. Though he married four girls, he said 'they were not real wives, and were only there for show [and] they were all my victims.' Rumours of homosexuality dogged him when he lived in Changchun under Japanese protection in the thirties and forties. He never had a son, or a daughter for that matter, which rather neatly solved a potential problem for the communists who took over in 1949. There were no loose ends for the Chinese to tie up, as there had been, with such bloody consequences, in Russia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="溥仪也在自传中承认自己“冷酷无情”，还写了一九二二年新婚之夜时，把皇后孤零零地扔在新房，因为还是觉得自己睡好。他先后有过四个妻子，但“如果从实质上说，她们谁也不是我的妻子，我根本就没有妻子，有的只是摆设。虽然她们每人的具体遭遇不同，但她们都是牺牲品”。三四十年代，他在日本人保护下生活在长春时，那时曾一度传出流言说他是个同性恋。他也从未有过一子半女，这也算是给一九四九年掌权的共产党省了很大的麻烦。中国人不用去收拾废帝子女这种烂摊子，不像俄国十月革命那样造成血腥残忍的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
