<div class="line_en">"I am the blood of the dragon," Dany reminded him. "Have you ever seen a dragon with the flux?"

To her left was Symon Stripeback of the Free Brothers and Marselen of the Mother's Men. Three score soldiers followed close behind the captains, to protect the food wagons.

<div class="line_en">I have no more help to give, Dany thought, despairing. The Astapori had no place to go. Thousands remained outside Meereen's thick walls -- men and women and children, old men and little girls and newborn babes. Many were sick, most were starved, and all were doomed to die. Daenerys dare not open her gates to let them in. She had tried to do what she could for them. She had sent them healers, Blue Graces and spell-singers and barber-surgeons, but some of those had sickened as well, and none of their arts had slowed the galloping progression of the flux that had come on the pale mare. Separating the healthy from the sick had proved impractical as well. Her Stalwart Shields had tried, pulling husbands away from wives and children from their mothers, even as the Astapori wept and kicked and pelted them with stones. A few days later, the sick were dead and the healthy ones were sick. Dividing the one from the other had accomplished nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也无法帮助更多了，丹妮绝望地想。阿斯塔波人无处可去，数千人滞留在弥林厚厚的砖墙外面——男人、女人、小孩、老人、小姑娘还有新生婴儿。许多人都病了，多数人都在挨饿，而所有人都注定死亡。丹妮莉丝不敢打开她的城门让他们进来。她已经尽自己最大的可能为他们提供帮助。她派出医者，蓝衣贤者还有诵术士甚至是庸医，但他们中的一些也生病了，而他们的技艺一点儿也没放缓苍白母马带来的血痢疾疾驰的脚步。将病患与尚未感染的人分开也被证实不可行。她的‘坚盾团’尝试过，即使阿斯塔波人哭泣着又踢又扔石子，他们还是将丈夫从妻子身边，孩子从母亲身边拉开。几天后，染病的人死了，而健康的人则病了。将人与人分开一点儿用也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Astapori stumbled after them in a ghastly procession that grew longer with every yard they crossed. Some spoke tongues she did not understand. Others were beyond speaking. Many lifted their hands to Dany, or knelt as her silver went by. "Mother," they called to her, in the dialects of Astapor, Lys, and Old Volantis, in guttural Dothraki and the liquid syllables of Qarth, even in the Common Tongue of Westeros. "Mother, please… mother, help my sister, she is sick… give me food for my little ones… please, my old father… help him… help her… help me…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Suffering was the only thing they did not lack. "There is scarcely a horse or mule left, though many rode from Astapor," Marselen reported to her. "They've eaten every one, Your Grace, along with every rat and scavenger dog that they could catch. Now some have begun to eat their own dead."</div>

<div class="line_en">Even feeding them had grown difficult. Every day she sent them what she could, but every day there were more of them and less food to give them. It was growing harder to find drivers willing to deliver the food as well. Too many of the men they had sent into the camp had been stricken by the flux themselves. Others had been attacked on the way back to the city. Yesterday a wagon had been overturned and two of her soldiers killed, so today the queen had determined that she would bring the food herself. Every one of her advisors had argued fervently against it, from Reznak and the Shavepate to Ser Barristan, but Daenerys would not be moved. "I will not turn away from them," she said stubbornly. "A queen must know the sufferings of her people."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使喂饱他们也变得艰难。每天她都送给他们她能给的，但每天他们都变得更多，而能给的食物却变得更少。找到愿意运输食物的车夫也变得困难，因为派进营地的很多人回来后都被血痢疾感染了，其他人则在回城路上被攻击。昨天一辆马车翻了，她的两个士兵死亡。所以今天，女王决心自己去分发食物。她的每个谏者都激烈的反对，从雷兹纳克到剃顶大人，还有巴利斯坦爵士，但丹妮莉丝没动摇。“我不会背弃他们，”她固执地说，“女王需知道她的子民遭受的苦难。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Little children with swollen stomachs trailed after them, too weak or scared to beg. Gaunt men with sunken eyes squatted amidst sand and stones, shitting out their lives in stinking streams of brown and red. Many shat where they slept now, too feeble to crawl to the ditches she'd commanded them to dig. Two women fought over a charred bone. Nearby a boy of ten stood eating a rat. He ate one-handed, the other clutching a sharpened stick lest anyone try to wrest away his prize. Unburied dead lay everywhere. Dany saw one man sprawled in the dirt under a black cloak, but as she rode past his cloak dissolved into a thousand flies. Skeletal women sat upon the ground clutching dying infants. Their eyes followed her. Those who had the strength called out. "Mother… please, Mother… bless you, Mother…"</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not wrong, she knew, but that did not make the words any easier to hear. "This is far enough," the queen decided. "We'll feed them here." She raised a hand.

No sooner had they stopped than the press began to thicken around them, as more and more of the afflicted came limping and shambling toward the wagons. The riders cut them off. "Wait your turn," they shouted. "No pushing. Back. Stay back. Bread for everyone. Wait your turn."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“看来‘祖父’爵士懂得数数。次子团反水加入了渊凯一方。”达里奥扭过头吐口唾沫。“这是给布朗·本·扑棱的。等到下次我看见他那张丑恶的脸，我定会撕开他的喉咙，扯出他的黑心脏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dany tried to speak and found no words. She remembered Ben's face the last time she had seen it. It was a warm face, a face I trusted. Dark skin and white hair, the broken nose, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. Even the dragons had been fond of old Brown Ben, who liked to boast that he had a drop of dragon blood himself. Three treasons will you know. Once for gold and once for blood and once for love. Was Plumm the third treason, or the second? And what did that make Ser Jorah, her gruff old bear? Would she never have a friend that she could trust? What good are prophecies if you cannot make sense of them? If I marry Hizdahr before the sun comes up, will all these armies melt away like morning dew and let me rule in peace?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮试图说点什么却发现无话可说。她仍记得上次她和本见面时本的面庞，那是张温暖的脸，温暖到我可以信任的脸。深黑的皮肤和纯白的发色，残破的鼻子，眼角的皱纹。就连她的龙也颇喜爱老布朗·本，喜爱那个常自夸自己体内流着真龙血脉的人。你将经受三次背叛。一次为财，一次为血，一次为爱。扑棱是第三次背叛还是第二次背叛呢？她的大熊乔拉爵士又是哪一次呢？她再也没有他能信任的朋友了么？若是不能发现预言何时发生，预言又有什么用？若我在日出之前与希兹达尔结婚，这些军队会像初阳下的晨露那样融化，然后任由我和平地统治吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Daario's announcement had sparked an uproar. Reznak was wailing, the Shavepate was muttering darkly, her bloodriders were swearing vengeance. Strong Belwas thumped his scarred belly with his fist and swore to eat Brown Ben's heart with plums and onions. "Please," Dany said, but only Missandei seemed to hear. The queen got to her feet. "Be quiet! I have heard enough."</div>

<div class="line_en">His hair smelled of blood and smoke and horse, and his mouth was hard and hot on hers. Dany trembled in his arms. When they broke apart, she said, "I thought you would be the one to betray me. Once for blood and once for gold and once for love, the warlocks said. I thought… I never thought Brown Ben.
