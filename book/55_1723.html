<div class="line_en">A survey of cultures by the anthropologist Laila Williamson reveals that infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by every kind of society, from nonstate bands and villages (77 percent of which have an accepted custom of infanticide) to advanced civilizations. Until recently, between 10 and 15 percent of all babies were killed shortly after they were born, and in some societies the rate has been as high as 50 percent. In the words of the historian Lloyd deMause, "All families once practiced infanticide. All states trace their origin to child sacrifice. All religions began with the mutilation and murder of children."</div>

They were all exposed as infants -- abandoned by their parents and left to the elements. The image of a helpless baby dying alone of cold, hunger, and predation is a potent tug on the heartstrings, so it is not surprising that a rise from infant exposure to dynastic greatness found its way into the mythologies of Jewish, Muslim, Roman, Greek, Persian, Akkadian, Sumerian, and Chinese civilizations. But the ubiquity of the exposure archetype is not just a lesson in what makes for a good story arc. It is also a lesson on how common infanticide was in human history. From time immemorial, parents have abandoned, smothered, strangled, beaten, drowned, or poisoned many of their newborns.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though infanticide is the most extreme form of maltreatment of children, our cultural heritage tells of many others, including the sacrifice of children to gods; the sale of children into slavery, marriage, and religious servitude; the exploitation of children to clean chimneys and crawl through tunnels in coal mines; and the subjection of children to forms of corporal punishment that verge on or cross over into torture. We have come a long way to arrive at an age in which one-pound preemies are rescued with heroic surgery, children are not expected to be economically productive until their fourth decade, and violence against children has been defined down to dodgeball.</div>

<div class="line_en">I began this book with one purpose in mind -- to understand, as stated in the Introduction: "How someone can take their own child, and strangle it to death?" When I first raised the question many years ago, I thought the issue to be suggestive of some unique pathologic alteration of Nature's way. It did not seem rational that evolution would maintain an inherited tendency to kill one's offspring when survival was already in such a delicate balance. Darwinian natural selection of genetic material meant that only the survival of the fittest was guaranteed; a tendency toward infanticide must certainly be a sign of unfit behavior that would not pass this reasonable standard. But the answer which has emerged from my research indicates that one of the most "natural" things a human being can do is voluntarily kill its own offspring when faced with a variety of stressful situations.</div>

<div class="line_en">The solution to Milner's puzzlement lies in the subfield of evolutionary biology called life history theory. The intuition that a mother should treat every offspring as infinitely precious, far from being an implication of the theory of natural selection, is incompatible with it. Selection acts to maximize an organism's expected lifetime reproductive output, and that requires that it negotiate the tradeoff between investing in a new offspring and conserving its resources for current and future offspring. Mammals are extreme among animals in the amount of time, energy, and food they invest in their young, and humans are extreme among mammals. Pregnancy and birth are only the first chapter in a mother's investment career, and a mammalian mother faces an expenditure of more calories in suckling the offspring to maturity than she expended in bearing it. Nature generally abhors the sunk-cost fallacy, and so we expect mothers to assess the offspring and the circumstances to decide whether to commit themselves to the additional investment or to conserve their energy for its born or unborn siblings. If a newborn is sickly, or if the situation is unpromising for its survival, they do not throw good money after bad but cut their losses and favor the healthiest in the litter or wait until times get better and they can try again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要回答米尔纳的困惑，我们要进入进化生物学的一个分支：生活史理论。认为母亲视每一个子女为无价之宝这种直觉，不仅不符合自然选择理论的含义，而且根本是不相容的。自然选择表现为让一个生物在其预期生命期间最大限度地繁衍后代，这需要在是为新生后代投入，还是为原有的和未来的后代保存实力之间进行权衡。在动物之中，哺乳动物在幼崽身上投入的时间、能量和食物极大，而人类又是哺乳动物极端中的极端。怀孕和生产只是母亲投资工程的开篇，哺乳类的母亲将婴儿抚育到成熟所消耗的卡路里远远大于孕期的消耗。大自然憎恶沉没成本谬误，因此我们认为母亲会评估后代和自己的处境，决定是增加投入，还是将能量保留给其他已出生和未出生的子女。如果婴儿身患疾病，或者如果生存环境过于险恶，父母就不愿意浪费资源，为烂命烧好钱，而是会控制成本，将资源转向最健壮的孩子，或者等待更好的时机做新的尝试。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To a biologist, human infanticide is an example of this triage. Until recently, women nursed their children for two to four years before returning to full fertility. Many children died, especially in the perilous first year. Most women saw no more than two or three of their children survive to adulthood, and many did not see any survive. To become a grandmother in the unforgiving environment of our evolutionary ancestors, a woman would have had to make hard choices. The triage theory predicts that a mother would let a newborn die when its prospects for survival to adulthood were poor. The forecast may be based on bad signs in the infant, such as being deformed or unresponsive, or bad signs for successful motherhood, such as being burdened with older children, beset by war or famine, or unable to count on support from relatives or the baby's father. It should also depend on whether she is young enough to have opportunities to try again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对生物学家来说，人类杀婴是一种典型的筛选分诊。直到最近，妇女一直是将自己的孩子抚育到两岁至四岁，再开始下一次孕育。许多孩子夭折，尤其是在生命的第一年。大多数母亲只能看见自己的两到三个孩子活到成年，很多母亲的孩子无一幸存。人类进化中的祖先们为了在严酷的环境中成为祖母，必须进行痛苦的抉择。根据分诊理论，在一个婴儿活到成年的前景过于黯淡的时候，可以预期他的母亲会任其死亡。这种黯淡前景的原因可以是婴儿的原因，比如身体畸形，没有活力；也可以是母亲的问题，如已经负有养育其他子女的重负，或遭遇战争和饥荒，无法得到家庭和孩子父亲的支持。当然，这也取决于母亲是否年轻，是否还有机会再次怀孕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Martin Daly and Margo Wilson tested the triage theory by examining a sample of sixty unrelated societies from a database of ethnographies. Infanticide was documented in a majority of them, and in 112 cases the anthropologists recorded a reason. Eighty-seven percent of the reasons fit the triage theory: the infant was not sired by the woman's husband, the infant was deformed or ill, or the infant had strikes against its chances of surviving to maturity, such as being a twin, having an older sibling close in age, having no father around, or being born into a family that had fallen on hard economic times.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ubiquity and evolutionary intelligibility of infanticide suggest that for all its apparent inhumanity, it is usually not a form of wanton murder but falls into a special category of violence. Anthropologists who interview these women (or their relatives, since the event may be too painful for the woman to discuss) often recount that the mother saw the death as an unavoidable tragedy and grieved for the lost child. Napoleon Chagnon, for example, wrote of the wife of a Yanomamö headman, "Bahami was pregnant when I began my fieldwork, but she destroyed the infant when it was born -- a boy in this case -- explaining tearfully that she had no choice. The new baby would have competed with Ariwari, her youngest child, who was still nursing. Rather than expose Ariwari to the dangers and uncertainty of an early weaning, she chose to terminate the newborn instead." Though the Yanomamö are the so-called fierce people, infanticide is not necessarily a manifestation of fierceness across the board. Some warring tribes, particularly in Africa, rarely kill their newborns, while some relatively peaceful ones kill them regularly. The title of Milner's magnum opus comes from a quotation from a 19th-century founder of anthropology, Edward Tylor, who wrote, "Infanticide arises from hardness of life rather than hardness of heart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杀婴的普遍性和杀婴在进化中的可理解性看起来非常不人道，人们一般不将此视为肆无忌惮的谋杀，而是当作特殊类型的暴力。采访过这些妇女（或者她们的亲戚——因为这些经历对母亲而言过于痛苦，有时需要其他亲人出面讲述）的人类学家通常都记录说，母亲认为婴儿死亡是不可避免的悲剧，并为失去的孩子悲伤不已。比如，据拿破仑·沙尼翁（Napoleon Chagnon）的记载，当他开始实地调查的时候，一位雅诺马马头领的妻子“巴哈米正好怀孕了，但孩子出世后，她弄死了婴儿，一个男孩儿。她眼泪汪汪地解释说她没有别的办法。婴儿和她最小的仍在吃奶的儿子阿里瓦里冲突了。为了不让阿里瓦里承担提早断奶的危险和不确定性，她选择了结束婴儿的生命”。尽管雅诺马马人被称为彪悍的民族，杀婴却不是表达彪悍的必要方式。非洲有一些好战的部落很少杀死他们的婴儿，而一些相对和平的部落反而常规性地杀婴。米尔纳的巨著的标题来自19世纪人类学奠基人爱德华·泰勒（Edward Tylor）的一句格言，他说过：“杀婴的起因与其说是心灵的冷酷，不如说是生活的冷酷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fateful tipping point between keeping and sacrificing a newborn is set both by internal emotions and by cultural norms. In a culture such as ours that reveres birth and takes every step to allow babies to thrive, we tend to think that joyful bonding between mother and newborn is close to reflexive. But in fact it requires overcoming considerable psychological obstacles. In the 1st century CE, Plutarch pointed out an uncomfortable truth:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是保留还是牺牲婴儿，命运的临界点由人的内心情感和文化规范共同决定。在我们这样的文化中，人们对生育怀有敬畏之意，要尽一切可能让幼儿长大成人；我们总是感到，母亲和婴儿之间那种愉悦的血肉关联几乎是本能的条件反射。但事实上，这种关联需要克服巨大的心理障碍。公元1世纪，希腊历史学家普鲁塔克就已经清楚地指出了这一令人不快的事实：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is nothing so imperfect, so helpless, so naked, so shapeless, so foul, as man observed at birth, to whom alone, one might almost say, Nature has given not even a clean passage to the light; but, defiled with blood and covered with filth, and resembling more one just slain than one just born, he is an object for none to touch or lift up or kiss or embrace except for someone who loves with a natural affection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一个男人眼中，没有什么比女人生产更不美好、更孤立无助、更赤裸裸、更不成样、更污秽的事情了；简直可以说，大自然甚至没有留下一丝光明，完全是一片血腥之气，把一个生命的降临搞得和杀戮一般，除了某些天性富于爱心的人，实在没有什么人愿意触摸、举起、亲吻或搂抱这个小东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The "natural affection" is far from automatic. Daly and Wilson, and later the anthropologist Edward Hagen, have proposed that postpartum depression and its milder version, the baby blues, are not a hormonal malfunction but the emotional implementation of the decision period for keeping a child. Mothers with postpartum depression often feel emotionally detached from their newborns and may harbor intrusive thoughts of harming them. Mild depression, psychologists have found, often gives people a more accurate appraisal of their life prospects than the rose-tinted view we normally enjoy. The typical rumination of a depressed new mother -- how will I cope with this burden?-- has been a legitimate question for mothers throughout history who faced the weighty choice between a definite tragedy now and the possibility of an even greater tragedy later. As the situation becomes manageable and the blues dissipate, many women report falling in love with their baby, coming to see it as a uniquely wonderful individual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而“天性富于爱心”却不是什么自动生成的东西。戴利和威尔逊，以及后来的人类学家爱德华·哈根（Edward Hagen）都建议说，产后抑郁及其轻度表现“产后抑郁期”（the baby blues）不是因为荷尔蒙失调，而是做出保存婴儿决定后的情绪化表现。患有产后抑郁症的母亲往往在情感上疏离婴儿，并可能怀有伤害婴儿的强迫性念头。心理学家已经发现，与我们通常享有的乐观态度相比，轻度抑郁通常让人们更准确地评估他们的生活前景。让一位抑郁的产后母亲感到最沉重也最真实的问题，就是如何承担养育孩子的重负。贯穿人类的历史，许多母亲们的抉择无非是立刻发生的悲剧和将来可能发生的更惨的悲剧。一旦情况进入正轨，抑郁消失，大部分母亲会爱上自己的婴儿，觉得自己的孩子是天底下独一无二的美妙造物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Many cultural traditions work to distance people's emotions from a newborn until its survival seems likely. People may be enjoined from touching, naming, or granting legal personhood to a baby until a danger period is over, and the transition is often marked by a joyful ceremony, as in our own customs of the christening and the bris. Some traditions have a series of milestones, such as traditional Judaism, which grants full legal personhood to a baby only after it has survived thirty days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很多文化传统在婴儿确定能够活下来之前，故意拉开人对婴儿的情感。当婴儿度过危险期，人们才被允许触摸婴儿，为其取名，或者授予其法定身份，并用欢乐的仪式迎接这一转变；在西方传统中，我们有基督教的命名礼和犹太教的割礼。有些传统有一系列里程碑式的仪式，比如在传统犹太教中，婴儿只有在出生30天之后才能被给予法律地位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen examined the psychiatric literature on postpartum depression to test five predictions of the theory that it is an evaluation period for investing in a newborn. As predicted, postpartum depression is more common in women who lack social support (they are single, separated, dissatisfied with their marriage, or distant from their parents), who had had a complicated delivery or an unhealthy infant, and who were unemployed or whose husbands were unemployed. He found reports of postpartum depression in a number of non-Western populations which showed the same risk factors (though he could not find enough suitable studies of traditional kin-based societies). Finally, postpartum depression is only loosely tied to measured hormonal imbalances, suggesting that it is not a malfunction but a design feature.</div>

<div class="line_en">If I have tried to make infanticide a bit more comprehensible, it is only to reduce the distance between the vast history in which it was accepted and our contemporary sensibilities in which it is abhorrent. But the chasm that separates them is wide. Even when we acknowledge the harsh evolutionary logic that applies to the hard lives of premodern peoples, many of their infanticides are, by our standards, hard to comprehend and impossible to forgive. Examples from Daly and Wilson's list include the killing of a newborn conceived in adultery, and the killing of all a woman's children from a previous marriage when she takes (or is abducted by) a new husband. And then there are the 14 percent of the infanticidal justifications on the list that, as Daly and Wilson point out, do not easily fall into categories that an evolutionary biologist would have predicted beforehand. They include child sacrifice, an act of spite by a grandfather against his son-in-law, filicides that are committed to eliminate claimants to a throne or to avoid the obligations of kinship customs, and most commonly, the killing of a newborn for no other reason than that she is a girl.</div>

<div class="line_en">Female infanticide has been put on the world's agenda today by census data revealing a massive shortage of women in the developing world. "A hundred million missing" is the commonly cited statistic for the daughter shortfall, a majority of them in China and India. Many Asian families have a morbid preference for sons. In some countries a pregnant woman can walk into an amniocentesis or ultrasound clinic, and if she learns she is carrying a girl, she can walk next door to an abortion clinic. The technological efficiency of daughter-proofing a pregnancy may make it seem as if the girl shortage is a problem of modernity, but female infanticide has been documented in China and India for more than two thousand years. In China, midwives kept a bucket of water at the bedside to drown the baby if it was a girl. In India there were many methods: "giving a pill of tobacco and bhang to swallow, drowning in milk, smearing the mother's breast with opium or the juice of the poisonous Datura, or covering the child's mouth with a plaster of cow-dung before it drew breath." Then and now, even when daughters are suffered to live, they may not last long. Parents allocate most of the available food to their sons, and as a Chinese doctor explains, "if a boy gets sick, the parents may send him to the hospital at once, but if a girl gets sick, the parents may say to themselves, 'Well, we'll see how she is tomorrow.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">Female infanticide is biologically mysterious. Every child has a mother and a father, so if people are concerned about posterity, be it for their genes or their dynasty, culling their own daughters is a form of madness. A basic principle of evolutionary biology is that a fifty-fifty sex ratio at sexual maturity is a stable equilibrium in a population, because if males ever predominated, daughters would be in demand and would have an advantage over sons in attracting partners and contributing children to the next generation. And so it would be for sons if females ever predominated. To the extent that parents can control the sex ratio of their surviving offspring, whether by nature or by nurture, posterity should punish them for favoring sons or daughters across the board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杀女婴可谓生物谜案。每个孩子都有母亲和父亲，如果每个人都关心自己的子孙后裔，希望自己的基因和家族的延续下去，剔除自己的女儿实在是一种疯狂的举动。进化生物学的一项基本原则是性成熟人口中两性比例应为50∶50，才有稳定的人口均衡。如果男性占多数，对女儿的需求就会上升，在吸引异性、生育下一代子女方面，女儿就会占据比儿子更有利的地位。同样，如果女性占人口多数，儿子的地位就会上升。无论是通过自然手段还是通过抚育，父母能够在某种程度上控制后代的性别比例，但是如果他们过分地偏向儿子而轻视女儿的话，子孙后代就会惩罚他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Female infanticide, also called gendercide and gynecide, is not unique to Asia. The Yanomamö are one of many foraging peoples that kill more newborn daughters than sons. In ancient Greece and Rome, babies were "discarded in rivers, dunghills, or cesspools, placed in jars to starve, or exposed to the elements and beasts in the wild." Infanticide was also common in medieval and Renaissance Europe. In all these places, more girls perished than boys. Often families would kill every daughter born to them until they had a son; subsequent daughters were allowed to live.</div>

<div class="line_en">One naïve hypothesis comes out of the realization that it is the number of females in a population that determines how rapidly it will grow. Perhaps tribes or nations that have multiplied themselves to the Malthusian limit on food or land kill their daughters to achieve zero population growth. One problem for the ZPG theory, however, is that many infanticidal tribes and civilizations were not environmentally stressed. A more serious problem is that it has the fatal flaw of all naïve good-of-the-group theories, namely that the mechanism it proposes is self-undermining. Any family that cheated on the policy and kept its daughters alive would take over the population, stocking it with their grandchildren while the excess bachelor sons of their altruistic neighbors died without issue. The lineages that were inclined to kill their newborn daughters would have died out long ago, and the persistence of female infanticide in any society would be a mystery.</div>

<div class="line_en">The biologist Robert Trivers and the mathematician Dan Willard reasoned that even though sons and daughters are expected to yield the same number of grandchildren on average, the maximum number that each sex can promise is different. A superfit son can outcompete other males and impregnate any number of women and thereby have any number of children, whereas a superfit daughter can have no more than the maximum she can bear and nurture in her reproductive career. On the other hand a daughter is a safer bet -- an unfit son will lose the competition with other men and end up childless, whereas an unfit daughter almost never lacks for a willing sex partner. It's not that her fitness is irrelevant -- a healthy and desirable daughter will still have more surviving children than an unhealthy and undesirable one -- but the difference is not as extreme as it is for boom-or-bust sons. To the extent that parents can predict the fitness of their children (say, by monitoring their own health, nutrition, or territory) and strategically tilt the sex ratio, they should favor sons when they are in better shape than the competition, and favor daughters when they are in worse shape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按照生物学家罗伯特·特里弗斯（Robert Trivers）和数学家丹·威拉德（Dan Willard）的推论，即使儿子和女儿平均会带来同样多的孙子孙女，但每个性别可能带来的最大数则不同。一个出色的儿子能够打败其他男性，让大量妇女受孕，因此生育大量子女；而一位出色的女儿能够生育的子女，最多是她在生育年龄能够受孕和抚养的数量。另一方面，女儿是更安全的赌注。一个软弱的儿子，在与其他男性的竞争中失利后，可能完全没有自己的孩子，而女儿再不济事，也总能找到愿意交配的伴侣。不是说她本身的条件不重要，一个健康和招人喜爱的女儿总是比虚弱和不讨人喜欢的女儿养活更多的孩子，但与男子之间的竞争相比，女子之间的竞争不是极端的生死对决。父母在某种程度上能够预测子女的强弱（比如说，通过检测他们的健康、营养和活动范围），策略性地扭曲性别比例；当儿子具有竞争力的时候，他们就会偏向儿子，而在儿子不争气的时候，就会偏向女儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Trivers-Willard theory has been confirmed in many nonhuman species and even, a bit, in Homo sapiens. In traditional societies, richer and higher-status people tend to live longer and attract more and better mates, so the theory predicts that higher-status people should favor sons and lower-status people should favor daughters. In some kinds of favoritism (like bequests in wills), that is exactly what happens. But with a very important kind of favoritism -- allowing a newborn to live -- the theory doesn't work so well. The evolutionary anthropologists Sarah Hrdy and Kristen Hawkes have each shown that the Trivers-Willard theory gets only half of the story right. In India, it's true that the higher castes tend to kill their daughters. Unfortunately, it's not true that the lower castes tend to kill their sons. In fact, it's hard to find a society anywhere that kills its sons. The infanticidal cultures of the world are either equal-opportunity baby-killers or they prefer to kill the girls -- and with them, the Trivers-Willard explanation for female infanticide in humans.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ultimate misogyny of female infanticide may suggest a feminist analysis, in which the sexism of a society extends to the right to life itself: being female is a capital offense. But that hypothesis doesn't work either. No matter how sexist these societies were (or are), they did not want a world that was Frauenfrei. The men do not live in all-boy treehouses in which no girls are allowed; they depend on women for sex, children, child-rearing, and the gathering or preparation of most of their food. Families that kill their daughters want there to be women around. They just want someone else to raise them. Female infanticide is a kind of social parasitism, a free rider problem, a genealogical tragedy of the commons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于杀女婴这种最极端的厌女主义，女权主义的分析是，一个社会的性别歧视触及生命的权利：身为女性，就是死罪。但是这个假说也不成立。不论性别歧视如何严重，没有一个社会是想完全没有女性的。男人们的世界并不是不容许女孩儿出现的男生树屋，他们在性生活、生养孩子、采集和烹煮食物上都依赖妇女。那些杀死女婴的家庭一样希望家中有女性忙碌的身影。他们只是想让别人来养育女孩儿。杀害女婴是一种社会寄生行为，是搭便车的老问题，是平民百姓传宗接代的悲剧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Free rider problems arise when no one owns a common resource, in this case, the pool of potential brides. In a free market in marriages in which parents wielded property rights, sons and daughters would be fungible, and neither sex would be favored across the board. If you really needed a fierce warrior or brawny field hand around the house, it shouldn't matter whether you raised a son for the job or raised a daughter who would bring you a son-in-law. Families with more sons would trade some of them for daughters-in-law and vice versa. True, your son-in-law's parents might prefer him to stay with them, but you could use your bargaining position to force the young man to move in with you if he wanted to have a wife at all. A preference for sons should arise only in a market with distorted property rights, one in which parents, in effect, own their sons but not their daughters.</div>

<div class="line_en">What about state societies like India and China? In state societies that practice female infanticide, Hawkes noted, parents also own their sons but not their daughters, though for economic rather than military reasons. In stratified societies whose elites have indivisible wealth, the inheritance often goes to a son. In India the caste system was an additional market distorter: lower castes had to pay steep dowries so their daughters could marry higher-caste grooms. In China, parents had a permanent claim on the support of their sons and daughters-in-law extending into their dotage, but not of their daughters and sons-in-law (hence the traditional adage "A daughter is like spilled water.") China's one-child policy, introduced in 1978, made parents' need for a son to support them in their old age all the more acute. In all these cases, sons are an economic asset and daughters a liability, and parents respond to the distorted incentives with the most extreme measures. Today infanticide is illegal in both countries. In China, infanticide is thought to have given way to sex-selective abortions, which are also illegal, though still widely practiced. In India, despite the inroads of the ultrasound-abortion chains, it is thought to remain common. The pressure to reduce these practices will almost certainly increase, if only because governments have finally done the demographic arithmetic and realized that gynecide today means unruly bachelors tomorrow (a phenomenon we will revisit).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="印度和中国这样的国家社会为什么会有严重的杀女婴问题呢？霍克斯认为，在国家社会中，父母同样只拥有儿子，不拥有女儿，原因是经济而不是军事。在阶层化的社会中，社会精英占有不可切分的财富，通常是由儿子继承。在印度，种姓制度是对市场的一种额外扭曲：低级种姓的家庭要支付大笔的陪嫁，才能将女儿嫁给高级种姓的新郎。在中国，父母永远可以向儿子和儿媳妇要求支持，但对女儿和女婿则没有这样的权利。（所以，中国的老话说“嫁出去的闺女泼出去的水。”）中国1978年开始实行独生子女政策，让父母们格外紧张，特别需要生养儿子，以便有人养老送终。在这些案例中，儿子都是财产，女儿则是负债，父母对扭曲的激励做出最极端的反应。今天，杀婴在这两个国家都属非法。在中国，杀婴已经让位给有选择地堕胎，虽然这种活动也是非法，但仍然相当普遍。在印度，尽管超声波检查—堕胎联营受到打击，但一般认为杀婴还是非常常见的行为。要求减少这类杀婴活动的压力肯定会越来越大，政府只需要做一点儿简单的人口算术，就会明白，今天杀害女婴，意味着明天面对大批难以驾驭的光棍汉（我们还会再回来讨论这个问题）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hawkes noted that among foraging peoples, female infanticide is more common in patrilocal societies (in which daughters move away to live with their husbands and in-laws) than in matrilocal societies (in which they stay with their parents and their husbands move in with them) or in societies in which the couple goes wherever they want. Patrilocal societies are common in tribes in which neighboring villages are constantly at war, which encourages related men to stay and fight together. They are less common when the enemies are other tribes, and the men have more freedom of movement within their territory. The internally warring societies then fall into a vicious circle in which they kill their newborn girls so their wives can hurry up and bear them more warrior sons, the better to raid other villages, and to defend their own villages against being raided, for a supply of women that had been decimated by their own infanticides. The warring tribes in Homeric Greece were caught in a similar trap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍克斯注意到，在采集人群中，有三种居住方式：男子入赘女家的社会，即女儿留在父母家，她们的丈夫迁入她们的家庭；或者小夫妻可以随意安排自己的居处；还有就是在从父（或从夫）居社会，即女儿出嫁进入夫家或婆家，在最后一种社会中，杀女婴情况最普遍。在邻村之间经常处于战争状态的部落社会里，从夫居（从父居）成为最常见的居住模式，因为战争需要有亲缘关系的男子抱团聚居，共同战斗。如果敌人来自其他部落，这种居住模式就不会这样常见，男人们在自己的领地内可以更自由地行动。内战频繁的社会会陷入残暴的循环，他们杀死女婴，他们的妻子可以立刻开始尝试繁衍男丁，于是就可以更有力地袭击其他村落，更好地防卫自己的家园，更多地劫掠其他人的妇女——特别是他们已经通过杀女婴将自己的女性残害殆尽了。在荷马时代的希腊，战事连绵的部落人就掉进了类似的陷阱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whether they are new mothers in desperate straits, putative fathers doubting their paternity, or parents preferring a son over a daughter, people in the West can no longer kill their newborns with impunity. In 2007 in the United States, 221 infants were murdered out of 4.3 million births. That works out to a rate of 0.00005, or a reduction from the historical average by a factor of two to three thousand. About a quarter of them were killed on their first day of life by their mothers, like the "trash-can moms' who made headlines in the late 1990s by concealing their pregnancies, giving birth in secret (in one case during a high school prom), smothering their newborns, and discarding their bodies in the trash. These women find themselves in similar conditions to those who set the stage for infanticide in human prehistory: they are young, single, give birth alone, and feel they cannot count on the support of their kin. Other infants were killed by fatal abuse, often by a stepfather. Still others perished at the hands of a depressed mother who committed suicide and took her children with her because she could not imagine them living without her. Rarely, a mother with postpartum depression will cross the line into postpartum psychosis and kill her children under the spell of a delusion, like the infamous Andrea Yates, who in 2001 drowned her five children in a bathtub.</div>

<div class="line_en">What drove down the Western rate of infanticide by more than three orders of magnitude? The first step was to criminalize it. Biblical Judaism prohibited filicide, though it didn't go the whole hog: killing an infant younger than a month did not count as murder, and loopholes were claimed by Abraham, King Solomon, and Yahweh himself for Plague #10. The prohibition became clearer in Talmudic Judaism and in Christianity, from which it was absorbed into the late Roman Empire. The prohibition came from an ideology that held that lives are owned by God, to be given and taken at his pleasure, so the lives of children no longer belonged to their parents. The upshot was a taboo in Western moral codes and legal systems on taking an identifiable human life: one could not deliberate on the value of the life of an individual in one's midst. (Exceptions were exuberantly made, of course, for heretics, infidels, uncivilized tribes, enemy peoples, and transgressors of any of several hundred laws. And we continue to deliberate on the value of statistical lives, as opposed to identifiable lives, every time we send soldiers or police into harm's way, or scrimp on expensive health and safety measures.)</div>

And while few people would admit to observations like Mercier's, they creep into intuitions that in practice distinguish the killing of a newborn by its mother from other kinds of homicide. Many European legal systems separate the two, defining a separate crime of infanticide or neonaticide, or granting the mother a presumption of temporary insanity. Even in the United States, which makes no such distinction, when a mother kills a newborn prosecutors often don't prosecute, juries rarely convict, and those found guilty often avoid jail. Sometimes, as with the trash-can moms of 1997, a media circus removes any possibility of leniency, but even these young women were paroled after three years in jail.</div>

<div class="line_en">The human life taboo was cemented by our reaction to the Nazi Holocaust, which proceeded in stages. It started with the euthanizing of mentally retarded people, psychiatric patients, and children with disabilities, then expanded to homosexuals, inconvenient Slavs, the Roma, and the Jews. Among the masterminds of the Holocaust and the citizens who were complicit with them, each stage may have made the next more thinkable. A bright line at the top of the slippery slope, we now reason, might have prevented people from sliding into depravity. Since the Holocaust a taboo on human manipulations of life and death have put public discussions of infanticide, eugenics, and active euthanasia beyond the pale. But like all taboos, the human life taboo is incompatible with certain features of reality, and fierce debates in bioethics today hinge on how to reconcile it with the fuzziness of the biological boundary that demarcates human life during embryogenesis, comas, and noninstantaneous deaths.</div>

<div class="line_en">For almost a millennium and a half the Judeo-Christian prohibition against infanticide coexisted with massive infanticide in practice. According to one historian, exposure of infants during the Middle Ages "was practiced on a gigantic scale with absolute impunity, noticed by writers with most frigid indifference." Milner cites birth records showing an average of 5.1 births among wealthy families, 2.9 among the middle class, and 1.8 among the poor, adding, "There was no evidence that the number of pregnancies followed similar lines." In 1527 a French priest wrote that "the latrines resound with the cries of children who have been plunged into them."</div>

Perhaps the least contentious claim about human nature is that humans are apt to have sex under a wider range of circumstances than those in which they are capable of bringing up the resulting babies. In the absence of contraception, abortion, or an elaborate system of social welfare, many children will be born without suitable caregivers to bring them to adulthood. Taboo or no taboo, many of those newborns will end up dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">At various points in the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, systems of criminal justice tried to do something about infanticide. The steps they took were a dubious improvement. In some countries, the breasts of unmarried servant women were regularly inspected for signs of milk, and if the woman could not produce a baby, she would be tortured to find out what happened to it. A woman who concealed the birth of a baby who did not survive was presumed guilty of infanticide and put to death, often by being sewn into a sack with a couple of feral cats and thrown into a river. Even with less colorful methods of punishment, the campaign to reduce infanticide by executing young mothers, many of them servants impregnated by the man of the house, began to tug on people's consciences, as they realized they were preserving the sanctity of human life by allowing men to dispose of their inconvenient mistresses.</div>

<div class="line_en">Various fig leaves were procured. The phenomenon of "overlying," in which a mother would accidentally smother an infant by rolling over it in her sleep, at times became an epidemic. Women were invited to drop off their unwanted babies at foundling homes, some of them equipped with turntables and trapdoors to ensure anonymity. The mortality rates for the inhabitants of these h omes ranged from 50 percent to more than 99 percent. 149 Women handed over their infants to wet nurses or "baby farmers" who were known to have similar rates of success. Elixirs of opium, alcohol, and treacle were readily obtainable by mothers and wet nurses to becalm a cranky infant, and at the right dosage it could becalm them very effectively indeed. Many a child who survived infancy was sent to a workhouse, "without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing," as Dickens described them in Oliver Twist, and where "it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this." Even with these contrivances, tiny corpses were a frequent sight in parks, under bridges, and in ditches. According to a British coroner in 1862, "The police seemed to think no more of finding a dead child than they did of finding a dead cat or a dead dog."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the 20th century, even before abortions were widely available, a girl who got pregnant was less likely to give birth alone and secretly kill her newborn, because other people had set up alternatives, such as homes for unwed mothers, orphanages that were not death camps, and agencies that found adoptive and foster parents for motherless children. Why did governments, charities, and religions start putting money into these lifesavers? One gets a sense that children became more highly valued, and that our collective circle of concern has widened to embrace their interests, beginning with their interest in staying alive. A look at other aspects of the treatment of children confirms that the recent changes have been sweeping.</div>

But it also reflects a change in the valuation of children. Rather than leaving it a pious aspiration, societies finally made good on the doctrine that the lives of infants are sacred -- regardless of who bore them, regardless of how shapeless and foul they were at birth, regardless of how noticeable a gap their loss would leave in a family circle, regardless of how expensive they were to feed and care for.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is true that in much of the world today, a similar proportion of pregnancies end in abortion as the fraction that in centuries past ended in infanticide. 151 Women in the developed West abort between 12 and 25 percent of their pregnancies; in some of the former communist countries the proportion is greater than half. In 2003 a million fetuses were aborted in the United States, and about 5 million were aborted throughout Europe and the West, with at least another 11 million aborted elsewhere in the world. If abortion counts as a form of violence, the West has made no progress in its treatment of children. Indeed, because effective abortion has become widely available only since the 1970s (especially, in the United States, with the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision), the moral state of the West hasn't improved; it has collapsed.</div>

<div class="line_en">This is not the place to discuss the morality of abortion, but the larger context of trends in violence can provide some insight into how people conceive of abortion. Many opponents of legalized abortion predicted that acceptance of the practice would cheapen human life and put society on a slippery slope toward infanticide, euthanasia of the handicapped, a devaluation of the lives of children, and eventually widespread murder and genocide. Today we can say with confidence that that has not happened. Though abortion has been available in most of the Northern Hemisphere for decades, no country has allowed the deadline for abortions during pregnancy to creep steadily forward into legal infanticide, nor has the availability of abortion prepared the ground for euthanasia of disabled children. Between the time when abortion was made widely available and today, the rate of every category of violence has gone down, and, as we shall see, the valuation of the lives of children has shot up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本书不是讨论堕胎是否道德的地方，但是暴力的长期趋势可以提供某种观察的角度，告诉我们，人们是怎样看待堕胎的。许多反对堕胎合法化的人预测，接受堕胎，将让人命特别是儿童的生命贬值，让社会滑向杀婴、对残疾人实施安乐死，逐步走向大规模的谋杀和屠杀。今天，我们可以肯定地说，这样的惨剧还没有发生过。虽然堕胎在世界上大多数国家已经实行了几十年，但没有一个国家不设定堕胎的孕期期限，任凭堕胎成为合法的杀婴，也没有一个国家提供堕胎作为处理残疾儿童的手段。从堕胎成为可广泛获得的手段以来，每种形式的暴力都在下降，我们已经看到，儿童生命的价值是在迅速上升。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Opponents of abortion may see the decline in every form of violence but the killing of fetuses as a stunning case of moral hypocrisy. But there is another explanation for the discrepancy. Modern sensibilities have increasingly conceived moral worth in terms of consciousness, particularly the ability to suffer and flourish, and have identified consciousness with the activity of the brain. The change is a part of the turning away from religion and custom and toward science and secular philosophy as a source of moral illumination. Just as the legally recognized end of life is now defined by the cessation of brain activity rather than the cessation of a heartbeat, the beginning of life is sensed to depend on the first stirrings of consciousness in the fetus. The current understanding of the neural basis of consciousness ties it to reverberating neural activity between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, which begins at around twenty-six weeks of gestational age. More to the point, people conceive of fetuses as less than fully conscious: the psychologists Heather Gray, Kurt Gray, and Daniel Wegner have shown that people think of fetuses as more capable of experience than robots or corpses, but less capable than animals, babies, children, and adults. The vast majority of abortions are carried out well before the milestone of having a functioning brain, and thus are safely conceptualized, according to this understanding of the worth of human life, as fundamentally different from infanticide and other forms of violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="反对堕胎的人看见了各种暴力的下降，但对他们来说，杀死胎儿仍然是令人震惊的道德伪善。对此，我们还有另一种解释。在现代人的情感中，越来越从感知的意义上，特别是从感受痛苦和实现自我的能力上看待道德价值，并将感知定位为大脑的活动。这一转变意味着人们开始摆脱宗教和习俗，转向科学和世俗的哲学，寻求道德启示的源泉。就像现行法律认定生命的终结是大脑停止活动，而不是心脏停止跳动，因此，生命的起点是胎儿大脑开始感知的那一瞬间。目前人们对感觉的神经基础的认识，将感觉与丘脑和大脑皮层之间的神经投射活动联系在一起，26周左右的胎儿开始具备这样的神经活动能力。简而言之，人们认为胎儿还没有完整的意识：心理学家希瑟·格雷（Heather Gray）、柯特·格雷（Kurt Gray）和丹尼尔·韦格纳（Daniel Wegner）告诉我们，人们认为胎儿的体验能力比机器人和尸体强，但不如动物、婴儿、儿童和成人。绝大部分堕胎都是发生在胎儿的大脑开始工作之前，从这一点来看，按照我们对人类生命价值的理解，可以肯定地说在堕胎和杀婴以及其他形式的暴力之间存在着原则性的差异。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The causes of much of the decline, to be sure, are practical. Contraception is cheaper and more convenient than abortion, and if it's readily available it will be the first choice of people with the foresight and self-control to use it. But presumably abortion has a moral dimension even among those who undergo it and among their compatriots who want to keep the option safe and legal. Abortion is seen as something to be minimized, even if it is not criminalized. If so, the trends in abortion offer a sliver of common ground in the rancorous debate between the so-called pro-life and pro-choice factions. The countries that allow abortion have not let an indifference to life put them on a slippery slope to infanticide or other forms of violence. But these same countries increasingly act as if abortion is undesirable, and they may be reducing its incidence as part of the move to protect all living things.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the long, sad history of violence against children, even when infants survived the day of their birth it was only to endure harsh treatment and cruel punishments in the years to come. Though hunter-gatherers tend to use corporal punishment in moderation, the dominant method of child-rearing in every other society comes right out of Alice in Wonderland: "Speak roughly to your little boy, and beat him when he sneezes." The reigning theory of child development was that children were innately depraved and could be socialized only by force. The expression "Spare the rod and spoil the child" has been attributed to an advisor to the king of Assyria in the 7th century BCE and may have been the source of Proverbs 13:24, "He that spareth the rod hateth his son: But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."

<div class="line_en">Severe corporal punishment was common for centuries. One survey found that in the second half of the 18th century, 100 percent of American children were beaten with a stick, whip, or other weapon. Children were also liable to punishment by the legal system; a recent biography of Samuel Johnson remarks in passing that a seven-year-old girl in 18th-century England was hanged for stealing a petticoat. Even at the turn of the 20th century, German children "were regularly placed on a red-hot iron stove if obstinate, tied to their bedposts for days, thrown into cold water or snow to 'harden' them, [and] forced to kneel for hours every day against the wall on a log while the parents ate and read." During toilet training many children were tormented with enemas, and at school they were "beaten until [their] skin smoked."</div>

<div class="line_en">That children with devils in them had to be beaten goes without saying. A panoply of beating instruments existed for that purpose, from cat-o'-nine tails and whips to shovels, canes, iron rods, bundles of sticks, the discipline (a whip made of small chains), the goad (shaped like a cobbler's knife, used to prick the child on the head or hands) and special school instruments like the flapper, which had a pear-shaped end and a round hole to raise blisters. The beatings described in the sources were almost always severe, involved bruising and bloodying of the body, began in infancy, were usually erotically tinged by being inflicted on bare parts of the body near the genitals and were a regular part of the child's daily life.</div>

DeMause notes that well into the 20th century, Japanese children were subjected to "beating and burning of incense on the skin as routine punishments, cruel bowel training with constant enemas,… kicking, hanging by the feet, giving cold showers, strangling, driving a needle into the body, cutting off a finger joint."

<div class="line_en">It was Trivers who first noticed that the theory of natural selection predicts no such thing. Some degree of conflict between parent and offspring is rooted in the evolutionary genetics of the family. Parents have to apportion their investment (in resources, time, and risk) across all their children, born and unborn. All things being equal, every offspring is equally valuable, though each benefits from parental investment more when it is young and helpless than when it can fend for itself. The child sees things differently. Though an offspring has an interest in its siblings' welfare, since it shares half its genes with each full sib, it shares all of its genes with itself, so it has a disproportionate interest in its own welfare. The tension between what a parent wants (an equitable allocation of its worldly efforts to all its children) and what a child wants (a lopsided benefit to itself compared to its siblings) is called parent-offspring conflict. Though the stakes of the conflict are the parents' investment in a child and its siblings, those siblings need not yet exist: a parent must also conserve strength for future children and grandchildren. Indeed, the first dilemma of parenthood -- whether to keep a newborn -- is just a special case of parent-offspring conflict.</div>

<div class="line_en">The theory of parent-offspring conflict says nothing about how much investment an offspring should want or how much a parent should be prepared to give. It says only that however much parents are willing to give, the offspring wants a bit more. Children cry when they are in need of help, and parents cannot ignore the cries. But children are expected to cry a bit louder and longer than their objective need calls for. Parents discipline children to keep them out of danger, and socialize them to be effective members of their community. But parents are expected to discipline children a bit more for their own convenience, and to socialize them to be a bit more accommodating to their siblings and kin, than the levels that would be in the interests of the children themselves. As always, the teleological terms in the explanation --"wants," "interests," "for"-- don't refer to literal desires in the minds of people, but are shorthand for the evolutionary pressures that shaped those minds.</div>

Unlike the tragedy of war, where each side has to be as fierce as its adversary, the violence of child-rearing is entirely one-sided. The children who were whipped and burned in the past were no naughtier than the children of today, and they ended up no better behaved as adults. On the contrary, we have seen that the rate of impulsive violence of yesterday's adults was far higher than today's.

<div class="line_en">The first nudge was ideological, and like so many other humanitarian reforms it originated in the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment. Children's tactics in parent-offspring conflict have led parents in every era to call them little devils. During the ascendancy of Christianity, that intuition was ratified by a religious belief in innate depravity and original sin. A German preacher in the 1520s, for instance, sermonized that children harbored wishes for "adultery, fornication, impure desires, lewdness, idol worship, belief in magic, hostility, quarreling, passion, anger, strife, dissension, factiousness, hatred, murder, drunkenness, gluttony," and he was just getting started. The expression "beat the devil out of him" was more than a figure of speech! Also, a fatalism about the unfolding of life made child development a matter of fate or divine will rather than the responsibility of parents and teachers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个变化是思想意识的改变。和许多人道主义改革一样，这个变化也是起源于理性时代和启蒙运动。孩子们对付“父母—子女冲突”的各种手腕，让每一个时代的父母都哀叹自己的孩子是“小恶魔”。在基督教兴起的年代，这种直觉被规范为天性中的堕落和原罪。比如，15世纪20年代，一位德国神学家在布道时说，孩子天性中隐藏着“通奸、乱伦、肮脏的欲望、淫荡、偶像敬拜、相信魔法、对抗、争吵、激情、愤怒、反叛、拉帮结派、仇恨、谋杀、酗酒和暴食暴饮”，而这些指控不过只是他的开篇而已。人们所说的“打得他灵魂出窍”其实不是一个简单的形容！对未来生活的宿命观，让孩子的培养成了命中注定的事情，免除了父母和教师的责任。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One paradigm shift came from John Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education, which was published in 1693 and quickly went viral. Locke suggested that a child was "only as white Paper, or Wax, to be moulded and fashioned as one pleases'-- a doctrine also called the tabula rasa (scraped tablet) or blank slate. Locke wrote that the education of children could make "a great difference in mankind," and he encouraged teachers to be sympathetic toward their pupils and to try to take their viewpoints. Tutors should carefully observe the "change in temper" in their students and should help them enjoy their studies. And teachers should not expect young children to show the same "carriage, seriousness, or application" as older ones. On the contrary, "they must be permitted… the foolish and childish actions suitable to their years."</div>

<div class="line_en">The idea that the way children are treated determines the kinds of adults they grow into is conventional wisdom today, but it was news at the time. Several of Locke's contemporaries and successors turned to metaphor to remind people about the formative years of life. John Milton wrote, "The childhood shows the man as morning shows the day." Alexander Pope elevated the correlation to causation: "Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined." And William Wordsworth inverted the metaphor of childhood itself: "The child is father of the man." The new understanding required people to rethink the moral and practical implications of the treatment of children. Beating a child was no longer an exorcism of malign forces possessing a child, or even a technique of behavior modification designed to reduce the frequency of bratty behavior in the present. It shaped the kind of person that the child would grow into, so its consequences, foreseen and unforeseen, would alter the makeup of civilization in the future.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，大家都知道，孩子得到什么样的对待决定了他将成长什么样的人，但在过去，这是鲜为人知的智慧。洛克的几位同代人和继承人使用各种比喻来提醒人们幼儿是形成性格的时期。约翰·弥尔顿说：“儿童之于成人，就像清晨之于一日。”亚历山大·蒲柏进一步到因果关联：“树枝弯了，树干也就跟着倾斜了。”威廉·华兹华斯将一个关于童年的比喻彻底颠倒了过来，他说：“儿童是成年男子的父亲。”这些新的理解促使人们反思原来对待儿童的粗暴方式的道德含义和实践效果。殴打儿童不再是从被恶魔势力控制的孩子身上驱邪，甚至也不再是单纯的手段，目的是要减少调皮捣蛋的频率。对儿童的暴力塑造了他的成年，其可预见和不可预见的结果，将影响未来的人类文明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another gestalt shift came from Rousseau, who replaced the Christian notion of original sin with the romantic notion of original innocence. In his 1762 treatise Émile, or On Education, Rousseau wrote, "Everything is good as it leaves the hand of the Author of things, and everything degenerates in the hands of man." Foreshadowing the theories of the 20th-century psychologist Jean Piaget, Rousseau divided childhood into a succession of stages centered on Instinct, Sensations, and Ideas. He argued that young children have not yet reached the Age of Ideas, and so should not be expected to reason in the ways of adults. Rather than drilling youngsters in the rules of good and evil, adults should allow children to interact with nature and learn from their experiences. If in the course of exploring the world they damaged things, it was not from an intention to do harm but from their own innocence. "Respect childhood," he implored, and "leave nature to act for a long time before you get involved with acting in its place." The 19th-century Romantic movement inspired by Rousseau saw childhood as a period of wisdom, purity, and creativity, a stage that children should be left to enjoy rather than be disciplined out of. The sensibility is familiar today but was radical at the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢梭提出了另一种格式塔，他认为孩子天性纯真，并用这一浪漫的观念替代了基督教中的原罪。在1762年出版的专著《爱弥儿，或论教育》中，卢梭写道：“在造物主手中时，一切都是美好的；一旦到了人的手中，所有的事情都开始变坏了。”作为20世纪心理学家让·皮亚杰理论的前奏，卢梭将童年划分为几个阶段：直觉、感性和理念。他认为，在年幼的儿童尚未到达“理念的年纪”时，不应该指望他们按照成人的方式推理。与其用善恶规则训练孩子，大人们不如允许孩子与自然互动，从他们自己的经验中学习。如果在探索世界时损坏了什么东西，这不过是天真的失误，而不是故意的破坏。他大声疾呼要“尊重童年”，在大人介入之前，要“让自然有充分的时间完成自己的工作”。在卢梭的启发之下，19世纪的浪漫主义运动将童年看作智慧、纯洁和创造力的时期，是儿童应该无拘束地享受而不是要以纪律制约的发展阶段。今天人们都熟识这一认知，但在当时，它却是相当激进的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the Enlightenment, elite opinion began to incorporate the childfriendly doctrines of the blank slate and original innocence. But historians of childhood place the turning point in the actual treatment of children considerably later, in the decades surrounding the turn of the 20th century. The economist Viviana Zelizer has suggested that the era from the 1870s to the 1930s saw a "sacralization" of childhood among middle- and upper-class parents in the West. That was when children attained the status we now grant them: "economically worthless, emotionally priceless." The era was inaugurated in England when a "baby-farming" scandal led to the formation of the Infant Protection Society in 1870 and to the Infant Life Protection Acts of 1872 and 1897. Around the same time, pasteurization and sterilized bottles meant that fewer infants were outsourced to infanticidal wet nurses. Though the Industrial Revolution originally moved children from backbreaking labor on farms to backbreaking labor in mills and factories, legal reforms increasingly restricted child labor. At the same time, the affluence that flowed from the maturing Industrial Revolution drove rates of infant mortality downward, reduced the need for child labor, and provided a tax stream that could support social services. More children went to school, which soon became compulsory and free. To deal with the packs of urchins, ragamuffins, and artful dodgers who roamed city streets, child welfare agencies founded kindergartens, orphanages, reform schools, fresh-air camps, and boys' and girls' clubs. Stories for children were written to give them pleasure rather than to terrorize them or moralize to them. The Child Study movement aimed for a scientific approach to human development and began to replace the superstition and bunkum of old wives with the superstition and bunkum of child-rearing experts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在启蒙运动年代，社会精英开始接受有利儿童的白板说和人天性纯真说。但有关历史学家认为，直到进入20世纪的前后几十年间，才真正出现了改变儿童待遇的转折点。经济学家维维安娜·泽利泽（Viviana Zelizer）认为，在19世纪70年代至20世纪30年代之间，在西方中层和上层阶级的父母中出现了一种“神圣化”童年的现象。自那时起，我们赋予儿童新的价值，即“经济上一钱不值，感情上无价之宝”。这个时代的发端是英国揭露一家“婴儿农场”的丑闻导致1870年成立的婴儿保护会社，接着在1872年和1897年制定了《婴儿生命保护法案》。大约就在同一时期，奶制品的巴斯德氏消毒法和消毒奶瓶的出现，让婴儿摆脱了依赖不负责任的奶妈喂养的状态。虽然工业革命最早是将儿童从筋疲力尽的小农民变成筋疲力尽的工厂童工，但工业革命积累起来的财富，终于降低了婴儿死亡率，也降低了对童工的需要，并为保护儿童的社会服务提供了稳定的税收。大部分儿童开始进入学校，不久学校教育成为国家对国民的义务并完全免费。对于街上成帮结派的流浪儿、叫花子和技巧高超的小骗子们，儿童福利机构开设幼儿园、孤儿院、感化院、教养营地，还有男童俱乐部和女童俱乐部。为孩子们创作的故事以带来愉悦为目的，而不再是制造恐惧或者是推行教化。儿童研究试图以科学方法实现人力开发，不再迷信夸夸其谈的老太太和所谓育儿专家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Manhattan in 1874, the neighbors of ten-year-old Mary Ellen McCormack, an orphan being raised by an adoptive mother and her second husband, noticed suspicious cuts and bruises on the girl's body. They reported her to the Department of Public Charities and Correction, which administered the city's jails, poorhouses, orphanages, and insane asylums. Since there were no laws that specifically protected children, the caseworker contacted the American Society for the Protection of Animals. The society's founder saw an analogy between the plight of the girl and the plight of the horses he rescued from violent stable owners. He engaged a lawyer who presented a creative interpretation of habeas corpus to the New York State Supreme Court and petitioned to have her removed from her home. The girl calmly testified:</div>

<div class="line_en">But whatever the causes were, they did not stop in the 1930s. Benjamin Spock's perennial bestseller Baby and Child Care was considered radical in 1946 because it discouraged mothers from spanking their children, stinting on affection, and regimenting their routines. Though the indulgence of postwar parents was a novelty at the time (widely and spuriously blamed for the excesses of the baby boomers), it was by no means a high-water mark. When the boomers became parents, they were even more solicitous of their children. Locke, Rousseau, and the 19th-century reformers had set in motion an escalator of gentleness in the treatment of children, and in recent decades its rate of ascent has accelerated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，不论这些原因是什么，它们在20世纪30年代继续发挥影响。本杰明·斯波克（Benjamin Spock）历久不衰的畅销书《斯波克育儿经》（Baby and Child Care）在40年代被认为立场相当激进，因为作者在书中劝告母亲不要打孩子，不要吝啬表达喜爱，也没有必要严厉地恪守规则。虽然战后一代父母放纵孩子在当时还是新鲜事物，人们认为婴儿潮一代的人就是这样被宠坏了。当婴儿潮一代自己成为父母之后，他们对孩子甚至更加体贴。洛克、卢梭和19世纪的改革家们开了温和对待儿童的先河，近几十年来这一趋势已经逐渐成为大潮流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though the rollover of the 19th century saw an acceleration in the valuation of children in the West, it was neither an abrupt transition nor a one-shot advance. Expressions of love of children, of grief at their loss, and of dismay at their mistreatment can be found in every period of European history and in every culture. Even many of the parents who treated their children cruelly were often laboring under superstitions that led them to think they were acting in the child's best interests. And as with many declines in violence, it's hard to disentangle all the changes that were happening at once -- enlightened ideas, increasing prosperity, reformed laws, changing norms.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since 1950, people have become increasingly loath to allow children to become the victims of any kind of violence. The violence people can most easily control, of course, is the violence they inflict themselves, namely by spanking, smacking, slapping, paddling, birching, tanning, hiding, thrashing, and other forms of corporal punishment. Elite opinion on corporal punishment changed dramatically during the 20th century. Other than in fundamentalist Christian groups, it's rare today to hear people say that sparing the rod will spoil the child. Scenes of fathers with belts, mothers with hairbrushes, and teary children tying pillows to their bruised behinds are no longer common in family entertainment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自20世纪50年代以来，人们更加不能容忍让孩子成为暴力的受害者。人们最容易控制的暴力就是他们自己实施的暴力，比如，他们施加在孩子身上的巴掌和拳脚，以及板子、鞭子、荆条、暴晒、殴打和其他形式的体罚。在20世纪，精英们对体罚的态度发生了天翻地覆的变化。除了基要派的基督教团体，人们已经很少再听得到“闲坏了棍子，惯坏了孩子”这样的说辞。父亲解开皮带，母亲挥舞梳子，孩子眼泪汪汪地用枕头护着他们屁股上的青紫瘀伤，这已经不再是常见的家庭娱乐场景了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At least since Dr. Spock, child-care gurus have increasingly advised against spanking. Today every pediatric and psychological association opposes the practice, though not always in language as clear as the title of a recent article by Murray Straus: "Children Should Never, Ever, Be Spanked No Matter What the Circumstances." The expert opinion recommends against spanking for three reasons. One is that spanking has harmful side effects down the line, including aggression, delinquency, a deficit in empathy, and depression. The cause-and-effect theory, in which spanking teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems, is debatable. Equally likely explanations for the correlation between spanking and violence are that innately violent parents have innately violent children, and that cultures and neighborhoods that tolerate spanking also tolerate other kinds of violence. The second reason not to spank a child is that spanking is not particularly effective in reducing misbehavior compared to explaining the infraction to the child and using nonviolent measures like scolding and time-outs. Pain and humiliation distract children from pondering what they did wrong, and if the only reason they have to behave is to avoid these penalties, then as soon as Mom's and Dad's backs are turned they can be as naughty as they like. But perhaps the most compelling reason to avoid spanking is symbolic. Here is Straus's third reason why children should never, ever be spanked: "Spanking contradicts the ideal of nonviolence in the family and society."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少自从斯波克医生出书以来，儿童养育大师们大多是告诫父母不要打孩子。今天，所有的儿科医生和心理协会都反对体罚，尽管使用的语言未见得像默里·斯特劳斯（Murray Straus）文章的标题那样直截了当：“无论如何永远不应该打孩子！”专家反对打孩子的意见出于三个理由。一是打孩子最终会带来有害的副作用，让孩子缺少同情心，产生侵略性、犯法倾向以及抑郁。打孩子等于告诉孩子暴力是解决问题的手段之一，这种逻辑关系是否成立是可以争论的。同样，我们可以这样解释打孩子和暴力之间的相关性，天生具有暴力倾向的父母也会有天生具有暴力倾向的孩子，而容忍暴力对付儿童的社区和文化，也容易容忍其他形式的暴力。二是在减少孩子犯错误方面，打孩子的效果远不如讲道理，也不如使用非暴力的惩罚手段，如训斥和禁闭。疼痛和羞辱让孩子分神，不再专心思考自己犯了什么错误，如果他们顺从的唯一目的就是避免处罚，那么一旦父母背过身去，他们立刻就会继续调皮捣蛋。避免打孩子最重要的原因也许只是象征性的。斯特劳斯认为永远不应该打孩子的第三个理由是：“巴掌与一个家庭和一个社会的非暴力理念水火不容。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Have parents been listening to the experts, or perhaps coming to similar conclusions on their own? Public opinion polls sometimes ask people whether they agree with statements like "It is sometimes necessary to discipline a child with a good, hard spanking" or "There are certain circumstances when it is all right to smack a child." The level of agreement depends on the wording of the question, but in every poll in which the same question has been asked in different years, the trend is downward. Figure 7-17 shows the trends since 1954 from three American datasets, together with surveys from Sweden and New Zealand. Before the early 1980s, around 90 percent of respondents in the English-speaking countries approved of spanking. In less than a generation, the percentage had fallen in some polls to just more than half. The levels of approval depend on the country and region: Swedes approve of spanking far less than do Americans or Kiwis, and Americans themselves are diverse, as we would expect from the southern culture of honor. In a 2005 survey, spanking approval rates ranged from around 55 percent in northern blue states (those that tend to vote for Democrats), like Massachusetts and Vermont, to more than 85 percent in southern red states (those that tend to vote for Republicans), like Alabama and Arkansas. Across the fifty states, the rate of approval of spanking tracks the homicide rate (the two measures show a correlation of 0.52 on a scale from -1 to 1), which could mean that spanked children grow up to be killers, but more likely that subcultures that encourage the spanking of children also encourage the violent defense of honor among adults. But every region showed a decline, so that by 2006 the southern states disapproved of spanking in the same proportion that the north-central and mid-Atlantic states did in 1986.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是父母听从了专家的意见，还是他们自己得出了相同的结论？民意调查有时会提出这样的问题：“狠狠地揍孩子一顿，有些时候是维持纪律所必需的”，或者“总有一些情况下，打孩子是完全正确的”。民调的结果取决于问题的选词和用语，但对那些历年来反复提出的问题，受访者中的认同人数明显呈下降趋势。图7—17给出了1954年以来美国的三套数据，加上来自瑞典和新西兰的调查结果。在20世纪80年代初期，英语国家中大约90%的受访者赞成揍孩子。不到一代人之后，这个比重降到大约50%。在不同的国家和地区，这个比重有所不同：瑞典同意打孩子的人比美国和新西兰少，美国内部地区之间也有差异，正如我们在审视荣誉杀人时看到的情况。2005年的一项调查发现，在北方（倾向于投票支持民主党）蓝色州，如麻省和佛蒙特，赞成打孩子的比重为55%，而在南方（倾向于支持共和党）的红色州，如亚拉巴马和阿肯色，这一比重超过85%。美国50个州赞同打孩子的比重与凶杀率吻合（两个指标的相关系数在—1到1的相关区间内为0.52），这可以是说遭到暴打的孩子长大后变成杀手，但更可能的是，鼓动揍孩子的亚文化也同样在成人中鼓动以凶杀保卫荣誉。但是，即便如此，各地支持暴力对待孩子的人数都在下降；到2006年，南方各州不赞同揍孩子的比重达到了中北部和大西洋沿岸中部各州1986年的水平。">查看中文翻译</div>

But it is consistent with other intrusions of the state into the family, such as compulsory schooling, mandatory vaccination, the removal of children from abusive homes, the imposition of lifesaving medical care over the objections of religious parents, and the prohibition of female genital cutting by communities of Muslim immigrants in European countries. In one frame of mind, this meddling is a totalitarian imposition of state power into the intimate sphere of the family. But in another, it is part of the historical current toward a recognition of the autonomy of individuals. Children are people, and like adults they have a right to life and limb (and genitalia) that is secured by the social contract that empowers the state. The fact that other individuals -- their parents -- stake a claim of ownership over them cannot negate that right.</div>

In his surveys of domestic violence, Straus gave respondents a checklist that included punishments that are now considered abusive.

<div class="line_en">A problem in self-reports of violence by perpetrators (as opposed to self-reports by victims) is that a positive response is a confession to a wrongdoing. An apparent decline in parents beating their children may really be a decline in parents owning up to it. At one time a mother who left bruises on her child might consider it within the range of acceptable discipline. But starting in the 1980s, a growing number of opinion leaders, celebrities, and writers of television dramas began to call attention to child abuse, often by portraying abusive parents as reprehensible ogres or grown-up children as permanently scarred. In the wake of this current, a parent who bruised a child in anger might keep her mouth shut when the surveyor called. We do know that child abuse had become more of a stigma in this interval. In 1976, when people were asked, "Is child abuse a serious problem in this country?" 10 percent said yes; when the same question was asked in 1985 and 1999, 90 percent said yes. Straus argued that the downward trend in his violence survey captured both a decline in the acceptance of abuse and a decline in actual abuse; even if much of the decline was in acceptance, he added, that would be something to celebrate. A decreasing tolerance of child abuse led to an expansion in the number of abuse hotlines and child protection officers, and to an expanded mandate among police, social workers, school counselors, and volunteers to look for signs of abuse and take steps that would lead to abusers being punished or counseled and to children being removed from the worst homes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与受害者的报告相反，施暴者自动报告事实上就是要他们承认自己犯了错误。目前父母打孩子的数量明显下降，很可能是更多的父母不愿意承认自己打了孩子。过去，母亲在孩子身上留下几块瘀伤不过说明她在管教自己的孩子。但自20世纪80年代起，越来越多的意见领袖、社会名流和电视剧作家开始呼吁公众关注虐待儿童的问题，他们经常将暴虐的父母塑造成食人恶魔，而受过虐待的儿童长大后都带有永久的心理创伤。在这样的社会潮流之下，即使父母曾经因暴怒在孩子身上留下伤疤，他们也不会向调查者实话实说。我们可以肯定，虐待儿童已经成为一种耻辱。1976年，当调查问“虐待儿童是否是这个国家的一个大问题”的时候，只有10%的人回答“是”；而在1985年和1999年，90%的人回答“是”。斯特劳斯认为，在他的调查中，针对儿童的暴力的下降，既反映了对暴力的接受程度在下降，也反映了实际暴力水平的下降；即使只有对暴力的接受程度的变化，也是值得大大欢呼的好事情。人们开始设立儿童保护热线电话，政府中有负责儿童保护的官员，警察、社工、学校的教育顾问和义工密切关注着周围儿童的安全和健康状况，一旦发现异常，立即采取保护措施，惩罚或者劝诫施虐者，并将孩子带离施虐的家庭。">查看中文翻译</div>

They corroborated the declining numbers with sanity checks such as victimization surveys, homicide data, offender confessions, and rates of sexually transmitted diseases, all of which are in decline. In fact over the past two decades the lives of children and adolescents improved in just about every way you can measure. They were also less likely to run away, to get pregnant, to get into trouble with the law, and to kill themselves.

<div class="line_en">The decline of child abuse in the 1990s coincided in part with the decline of adult homicide, and its causes are just as hard to pinpoint. Finkelhor and Jones examined the usual suspects. Demography, capital punishment, crack cocaine, guns, abortion, and incarceration can't explain the decline. The prosperity of the 1990s can explain it a little, but can't account for the decline in sexual abuse, nor a second decline of physical abuse in the 2000s, when the economy was in the tank. The hiring of more police and interveners from social service agencies probably helped, and Finkelhor and Jones speculate that another exogenous factor may have made a difference. The early 1990s was the era of Prozac Nation and Running on Ritalin. The massive expansion in the prescription of medication for depression and attention deficit disorder may have lifted many parents out of depression and helped many children control their impulses. Finkelhor and Jones also pointed to nebulous but potentially potent changes in cultural norms. The 1990s, as we saw in chapter 3, hosted a civilizing offensive that reversed some of the licentiousness of the 1960s and made all forms of violence increasingly repugnant. And the Oprahfication of America applied a major stigma to domestic violence, while destigmatizing -- indeed beatifying -- the victims who brought it to light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="90年代虐童案的下降与成人凶杀案件的下降不谋而合，而且同样很难找到单一的原因。芬克勒尔和琼斯审视了几种可能性。人口构成、严刑峻法、缉毒、枪支、堕胎以及监狱都无法解释犯罪下降的原因。90年代的经济繁荣也许算得上很次要的原因之一，但它既不能解释性虐案的下降，也不能解释进入21世纪经济发展开始停滞后虐童案的第二波下降。警察数量的增加和社工人员的积极干预也许很有效，但芬克勒尔和琼斯提出了一个外生因素。20世纪90年代初期正是电影《少女初体验》（Prozac Nation）和《兴奋剂利他林》（Running on Ritalin）上演的年代。抗抑郁药物和儿童注意力缺失症药物的大量使用，一方面让父母自己走出晦暗阴郁，另一方面帮助很多孩子控制住自己的冲动。芬克勒尔和琼斯还指出，文化范式发生了尽管模糊但却强有力的变化。正如我们在第3章中看到的，正是在90年代，文明攻势扭转了60年代的放荡，克制了各种形式的暴力活动。美国电视上听众参与的访谈节目暴露了各种家庭暴力，对现身说法的受害者充满同情甚至美化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Until recently, adults had written off bullying as one of the trials of childhood. "Boys will be boys," they said, figuring that an ability to deal with intimidation in childhood was essential training for the ability to deal with it in adulthood. The victims, for their part, had nowhere to turn, because complaining to a teacher or parent would brand them as snitches and pantywaists and make their lives more hellish than ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another kind of violence that torments many children is the violence perpetrated against them by other children. Bullying has probably been around for as long as children have been around, because children, like many juvenile primates, strive for dominance in their social circle by demonstrating their mettle and strength. Many childhood memoirs include tales of cruelty at the hands of other children, and the knuckle-dragging bully is a staple of popular culture. The rogues' gallery includes Butch and Woim in Our Gang, Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future trilogy, Nelson Muntz in The Simpsons, and Moe in Calvin and Hobbes (figure 7-21).</div>

<div class="line_en">But in another of those historical gestalt shifts in which a category of violence flips from inevitable to intolerable, bullying has been targeted for elimination. The movement emerged from the ball of confusion surrounding the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, as the media amplified one another's rumors about the causes -- Goth culture, jocks, antidepressants, video games, Internet use, violent movies, the rock singer Marilyn Manson -- and one of them was bullying. As it turned out, the two assassins were not, as the media endlessly repeated, Goths who had been picked on by jocks. But a popular understanding took hold that the massacre was an act of revenge, and childhood professionals parlayed the urban legend into a campaign against bullying. Fortunately, the theory -- bully victim today, cafeteria sniper tomorrow -- coexisted with more respectable rationales, such as that victims of bullies suffer from depression, impaired performance in school, and an elevated risk of suicide. Currently forty-four states have laws that prohibit bullying in school, and many have mandatory curricula that denounce bullying, encourage empathy, and instruct children in how to resolve their conflicts constructively. Organizations of pediatricians and child psychologists have issued statements calling for prevention efforts, and magazines, television programs, the Oprah Winfrey empire, and even the president of the United States have targeted it as well. In another decade, the facetious treatment of bullying in the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon may become as offensive as the spank-the-wife coffee ads from the 1950s are to us today.</div>

<div class="line_en">Psychological consequences aside, the moral case against bullying is ironclad. As Calvin observed, once you grow up, you can't go beating people up for no reason. We adults protect ourselves with laws, police, workplace regulations, and social norms, and there is no conceivable reason why children should be left more vulnerable, other than laziness or callousness in considering what life is like from their point of view. The increased valuation of children, and the universalizing of moral viewpoints of which it is a part, made the campaign to protect children from violence by their peers inevitable. So too the effort to protect them from other depredations. Children and teenagers have long been victims of petty crimes like the theft of lunch money, vandalism of their possessions, and sexual groping, which fall in the cracks between school regulations and criminal law enforcement. Here too the interests of younger humans are increasingly being recognized.</div>

Departments of Justice and Education issued a report on Indicators of School Crime and Safety that used victimization surveys and school and police statistics to document trends in violence against students from 1992 to 2003.

<div class="line_en">One of these taboos is what the psychologist Judith Harris calls the Nurture Assumption. Locke and Rousseau helped set off a revolution in the conceptualization of child-rearing by rewriting the role of caregivers from beating bad behavior out of children to shaping the kind of people they would grow into. By the late 20th century, the idea that parents can harm their children by abusing and neglecting them (which is true) grew into the idea that parents can mold their children's intelligence, personalities, social skills, and mental disorders (which is not). Why not? Consider the fact that children of immigrants end up with the accent, values, and norms of their peers, not of their parents. That tells us that children are socialized in their peer group rather than in their families: it takes a village to raise a child. And studies of adopted children have found that they end up with personalities and IQ scores that are correlated with those of their biological siblings but uncorrelated with those of their adopted siblings. That tells us that adult personality and intelligence are shaped by genes, and also by chance (since the correlations are far from perfect, even among identical twins), but are not shaped by parents, at least not by anything they do with all their children. Despite these refutations, the Nurture Assumption developed a stranglehold on professional opinion, and mothers have been advised to turn themselves into round-the-clock parenting machines, charged with stimulating, socializing, and developing the characters of the little blank slates in their care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="禁忌之一就是心理学家朱迪思·哈里斯（Judith Harris）所批评的“教养说”。洛克和卢梭开启了儿童养育理念的革命，改写了养育者的角色，将通过体罚纠正孩子的坏毛病，变为通过塑造为未来培养人才。到20世纪后期，父母虐待和忽视孩子会对孩子造成伤害的观念（这个观念是对的），逐渐让位于父母能够造就孩子的智力、个性、社交能力，甚至精神错乱（这个观点是错的）。为什么说它是错的呢？只要看看移民的孩子就知道，孩子们的口音、价值和行为标准最终是追随他们的同代人，而不是他们的父母。这个事实告诉我们，孩子是与同伴一起，而不是与父母家庭一起进入社会：养育孩子需要举全村之力。对领养儿童的研究发现，被收养孩子的个性和智商与他们的亲生同胞相关，而与领养家庭的同胞无关。这一事实告诉我们，成人的个性和智商是由基因和机会决定的（因为这里的相关性并不完全，即使是同卵双胞胎也有差异），而不是由父母后天塑造而成，至少不是父母对孩子的管教塑造而成的。尽管有这样那样的反证，“教养说”却发展出一套非常顽固的专业见解，接受这些观点的母亲们把自己变成每天24小时运转的育儿机器，激励、培养和开发她们怀中的小白板。">查看中文翻译</div>

In Chicago in 2009, after twenty-five students aged eleven to fifteen took part in the age-old sport of a cafeteria food fight, they were rounded up by the police, handcuffed, herded into a paddy wagon, photographed for mug shots, and charged with reckless conduct. Zero-tolerance policies for weapons on school property led to a threat of reform school for a six-year-old Cub Scout who had packed an all-in-one camping utensil in his lunch box, the expulsion of a twelve-year-old girl who had used a utility knife to cut windows out of a paper house for a class project, and the suspension of an Eagle Scout who followed the motto "Be Prepared" by keeping a sleeping bag, drinking water, emergency food, and a two-inch pocketknife in his car.

<div class="line_en">Adults have increasingly tried to keep depictions of violence out of children's culture. In a climactic sequence of the 1982 movie E. T., Elliott sneaks past a police roadblock with E. T. in the basket of his bicycle. When the film was rereleased in a 20th-anniversary version in 2002, Steven Spielberg had digitally disarmed the officers, using computer-generated imagery to replace their rifles with walkie-talkies. Around Halloween, parents are now instructed to dress their children in "positive costumes" such as historical figures or items of food like carrots or pumpkins rather than zombies, vampires, or characters from slasher films. A memo from a Los Angeles school carried the following costume advisory:</div>

<div class="line_en">The historical increase in the valuation of children has entered its decadent phase. Now that children are safe from being smothered on the day they are born, starved in foundling homes, poisoned by wet nurses, beaten to death by fathers, cooked in pies by stepmothers, worked to death in mines and mills, felled by infectious diseases, and beaten up by bullies, experts have racked their brains for ways to eke infinitesimal increments of safety from a curve of diminishing or even reversing returns. Children are not allowed to be outside in the middle of the day (skin cancer), to play in the grass (deer ticks), to buy lemonade from a stand (bacteria on lemon peel), or to lick cake batter off spoons (salmonella from uncooked eggs). Lawyer-vetted playgrounds have had their turf padded with rubber, their slides and monkey bars lowered to waist height, and their seesaws removed altogether (so that the kid at the bottom can't jump off and watch the kid at the top come hurtling to the ground -- the most fun part of playing on a seesaw). When the producers of Sesame Street issued a set of DVDs containing classic programs from the first years of the series (1969-74), they included a warning on the box that the shows were not suitable for children! The programs showed kids engaging in dangerous activities like climbing on monkey bars, riding tricycles without helmets, wriggling through pipes, and accepting milk and cookies from kindly strangers. Censored altogether was Monsterpiece Theater, because at the end of each episode the ascotted, smoking-jacketed host, Alistair Cookie (played by Cookie Monster), gobbled down his pipe, which glamorizes the use of tobacco products and depicts a choking hazard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="儿童价值的历史性提升已经进入其衰落期。孩子不再面对出生时被闷死的噩运，不再在冷酷的孤儿院忍饥挨饿，不再被乳母下药，被父亲痛殴，被继母屠宰做成肉馅，不再在矿井或车间里累死累活，或者感染传染病，也不再被同伴殴打。现在的专家们绞尽脑汁，要在下行的曲线甚至反弹曲线上寻找一点点新的增量。不准许孩子们中午在户外活动——有患皮肤癌的风险，不能在草地上玩耍——有跳蚤，不能从其他孩子的小摊子上买柠檬水——没有洗干净的柠檬皮上有细菌，不能在妈妈做蛋糕的时候舔打奶油的勺子——没有做熟的鸡蛋有沙门氏菌。律师出马检查所有的操场，确保所有地方都铺满橡胶软垫，滑梯和攀登架的高度不能超过腰部，跷跷板要一律拆除，这样就不会有在下方的孩子跳离位子，看着还在上方的孩子掉到地上——这本来是跷跷板最好玩的噱头。儿童教育节目《芝麻街》的制片人发行了一套DVD（数字多功能光盘），包括这套经典系列节目最初几年的合集（1969—1974年），他们竟然在包装外盒上警告说有些节目可能“儿童不宜”！节目中有孩子进行“危险活动”的内容，如爬上攀登架，没有戴头盔骑在自行车上，在弯弯曲曲的筒子里爬进爬出，从和善的陌生人手中接受牛奶和饼干。受到审查总清算的节目是，《魔怪大作剧院》（Monsterpiece Theater）在每一集节目的结尾，都有穿着大领结小夹克、口衔烟斗的主持人蓝色“曲奇饼小妖怪”吞云吐雾，这无疑美化了香烟产品，会带来让孩子窒息的风险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But nothing has transformed childhood as much as the risk of kidnapping by strangers, a textbook case in the psychology of fear. Since 1979, when six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared on his way to a school bus stop in lower Manhattan, kidnapped children have riveted the nation's attention, thanks to three interest groups that are dedicated to sowing panic among the nation's parents. The grief-stricken parents of murdered children understandably want something good to come out of their tragedies, and several have devoted their lives to raising awareness of child abductions. (One of them, John Walsh, campaigned to have photographs of missing children featured on milk cartons, and hosted a lurid television program, America's Most Wanted, which specialized in horrific kidnap-murders.) Politicians, police chiefs, and corporate publicists can smell a no-lose campaign from a mile away -- who could be against protecting children from perverts?-- and have held ostentatious ceremonies to announce protective measures named after missing children (Code Adam, Amber Alerts, Megan's Law, the National Missing Children Day). The media too can recognize a ratings pump when they see one, and have stoked the fear with round-the-clock vigils, documentaries in constant rotation ("It is every parent's nightmare…"), and a Law and Order spinoff dedicated to nothing but sex crimes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对童年影响最大的莫过于被陌生人绑架，可谓造成恐惧心理的典型案例。1979年，当时年仅6岁的伊丹·派兹在纽约下曼哈顿去校车站的路上失踪，自那时起，儿童绑架案成为全国关注的重点，美国有三家利益团体全力以赴安抚恐慌的父母。我们可以理解，失去孩子的父母希望自己的悲剧还能产生一些积极的结果，其中一些父母用余生奋力呼吁社会对被拐骗儿童的关注。（其中之一是约翰·沃尔什，他推动在牛奶包装盒上印刷失踪儿童的照片，并成为美国极受欢迎的电视节目《美国通缉犯》的主持人，节目涉及很多绑架—谋杀案。）政客、警长、公关公司负责人当然知道他们绝对不能错过这些社会运动，有谁胆敢出头反对保护儿童免受伤害呢？他们纷纷在宣布保护儿童的新立法的仪式上露面，这些新法案往往以失踪儿童的名字命名，如《亚当条款》《安玻警戒》《梅根法》，还有“全国失踪儿童日”。媒体也认识到这些案件都是收视率的发动机，他们不仅不分昼夜连轴转地报道儿童失踪案件，节目弥漫着恐惧，而且不失时机地推出纪录片（“这是每个父母的噩梦…”），电视连续剧《法律与秩序》还专门辟出一个系列，主题就是性犯罪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Childhood has never been the same. American parents will not let their children out of their sight. Children are chauffeured, chaperoned, and tethered with cell phones, which, far from reducing parents' anxiety, only sends them into a tizzy if a child doesn't answer on the first ring. Making friends in the playground has given way to mother-arranged playdates, a phrase that didn't exist before the 1980s. Forty years ago two-thirds of children walked or biked to school; today 10 percent do. A generation ago 70 percent of children played outside; today the rate is down to 30 percent. In 2008 the nine-year-old son of the journalist Lenore Skenazy begged her to let him go home by himself on the New York subway. She agreed, and he made it home without incident. When she wrote about the vignette in a New York Sun column, she found herself at the center of a media frenzy in which she was dubbed "America's Worst Mom." (Sample headline: "Mom Lets 9-Year-Old Take Subway Home Alone: Columnist Stirs Controversy with Experiment in Childhood Independence.") In response she started a movement -- Free-Range Children -- and proposed National Take Our Children to the Park and Leave Them There Day, intended to get children to learn to play by themselves without constant adult supervision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="美国儿童的童年从此彻底改变了。父母绝对不会让孩子离开自己的视野。孩子有司机，有看护，装备了手机，不过，手机完全没有减轻父母的焦虑；如果孩子没有在铃响的第一时间接起电话，父母就会惊恐万分。原来，孩子们在操场结识新朋友，现在必须依靠妈妈们拉媒牵线，这在20世纪80年代之前还是很少见的。40年前，2/3的孩子或者步行上学，或者骑自行车上学；今天只有10%的孩子还在这样做。一代人之前，70%的孩子在户外玩耍，今天只剩下30%。2008年，记者莉诺·思科纳齐9岁的儿子乞求母亲让他放学后独自一人乘纽约的地铁回家。莉诺同意了，孩子平安地完成了旅程回到家中。当她在《纽约太阳报》的专栏上报道了这个小花絮时，她立即成为媒体攻击的全民公敌，被冠以“美国最糟糕母亲”的头衔。（典型的报道标题如：“妈妈让9岁的孩子自己乘坐地铁：专栏作家的儿童独立实验掀起风波。”）作为回应，她发起了一场“放养儿童”运动，并提议设立“全国儿童公园独立活动日”，即每年有一天将孩子带到公园，并将孩子自己留在公园，让孩子有机会学习怎样在没有大人监督的情况下自己游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Skenazy is not, in fact, America's worst mom. She simply did what no politician, policeman, parent, or producer ever did: she looked up the facts. The overwhelming majority of milk-carton children were not lured into vans by sex perverts, child traffickers, or ransom artists, but were teenagers who ran away from home, or children taken by a divorced parent who was embittered by an unfavorable custody ruling. The annual number of abductions by strangers has ranged from 200 to 300 in the 1990s to about 100 today, around half of whom are murdered. With 50 million children in the United States, that works out to an annual homicide rate of one in a million (0.001 per hundred thousand, to use our usual metric). That's about a twentieth of the risk of drowning and a fortieth of the risk of a fatal car accident. The writer Warwick Cairns calculated that if you wanted your child to be kidnapped and held overnight by a stranger, you'd have to leave the child outside and unattended for 750,000 years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉诺·思科纳齐肯定不是美国最糟糕的妈妈。她仅仅做了一件政客、警察、父母或者制片人都没有做过的事情：对事实进行了调查。牛奶包装盒上的失踪儿童中，绝大部分都不是被性罪犯、儿童贩子、索取赎金的绑架者拐带走的，而是十几岁的孩子自己离家出走，或者被离婚后父母中不满监护协议的一方带走。90年代，美国每年有200～300个孩子被陌生人拐骗失踪，现在这类案件每年大约有100起，其中半数案件中的孩子被谋杀。美国有5000万儿童，拐骗谋杀率为百万分之一（而用我们常用的衡量标准来看，拐骗谋杀率为0.1/100000。这大约是溺毙风险的1/20，车祸死亡的1/40。作家沃里克·凯恩斯（Warwick Cairns）做了一些计算，结果是，如果一个人想要自己的孩子被绑架，需要把孩子留在无人看管的街上长达75万年。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One might reply that the safety of a child is so precious that even if these precautions saved a few lives a year, they would be worth the anxiety and expense. But the reasoning is spurious. People inescapably trade off safety for other good things in life, as when they set aside money for their children's college education rather than installing a sprinkler system in their homes, or drive with their children to a vacation destination rather than letting them play video games in the safety of their bedrooms all summer. The campaign for perfect safety from abductions ignores costs like constricting childhood experience, increasing childhood obesity, instilling chronic anxiety in working women, and scaring young adults away from having children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人会认为，孩子的安全如此紧要，即使出现这些过度紧张和过度开销，每年能挽救几条小性命也是值得的。但这种推理非常虚假。在生活中，人们不可避免要在安全和其他美好事物之间进行取舍，就像父母为孩子积攒学费而放弃安装室内自动喷水消防装置，或者开车带着孩子外出度假，而不是整个夏天把他们留在家中玩电子游戏——虽然这样显然更安全。避免绑架的安全措施造成的代价是，孩子童年的经历变得狭窄了，肥胖症的人数上升，外出工作的母亲长时间持续紧张，年轻人吓得不敢生养孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And even if minimizing risk were the only good in life, the innumerate safety advisories would not accomplish it. Many measures, like the milk-carton wanted posters, are examples of what criminologists call crime-control theater: they advertise that something is being done without actually doing anything. When 300 million people change their lives to reduce a risk to 50 people, they will probably do more harm than good, because of the unforeseen consequences of their adjustments on the vastly more than 50 people who are affected by them. To take just two examples, more than twice as many children are hit by cars driven by parents taking their children to school as by other kinds of traffic, so when more parents drive their children to school to prevent them from getting killed by kidnappers, more children get killed. And one form of crime-control theater, electronic highway signs that display the names of missing children to drivers on freeways, may cause slowdowns, distracted drivers, and the inevitable accidents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使将风险最小化是我们追求的唯一目标，盲目的安全建议也无济于事。许多措施，比如牛奶包装盒上的通缉犯图片，都属于犯罪学家所说的犯罪控制剧场，即属于广告宣传，不需要任何实际行动。实际上，当3亿人为了50个人的安全改变了自己的生活方式，造成的伤害可能远远超过了带来的好处，这种规模巨大的调整的后果往往不可预见。仅举两个例子：第一个，被家长送孩子上学的车辆撞死的孩子比其他车祸死亡高两倍，所以，有更多的家长为了自己的孩子免遭绑架而开车送孩子上学，就有更多的孩子死于交通事故；第二个，高速公路上电子显示牌上发布失踪孩子的信息，导致驾车人分神和减速，也是导致车祸的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
