<div class="line_en">Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy. At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French, American, and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas, and flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres. Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going into a barber's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow, which is the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing why, thought this very funny.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port. The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite coast. Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade, and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic cathedral, a government house, macadamised streets, give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="香港不过是一个小岛，1842年鸦片战争之后签订了《南京条约》，这个小岛就被英国占领了。没用几年英国以其殖民者的才能就把这里建成了一座大城市和一个海港——维多利亚港。这个小岛位于珠江口上，距离对岸葡萄牙占领的澳门只有六十英里。香港在商业竞争方面必然会战胜澳门。目前中国大部分商品出口都经过香港。这里有船坞、医院、码头、仓库；还有一座哥特式建筑的大教堂和一个总督府；到处是碎石铺成的马路，这一切都使人觉得这是英国肯特郡或萨里郡的某一个商业城市，从地球的那一面钻过来，再出现在这一块中国的土地上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Monsieur Fix," said Passepartout, "have you decided to go with us so far as America?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is bad," muttered Passepartout, "for the gentlemen of the Reform Club!" He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived that gentleman's chagrin. The detective had, indeed, good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him. The warrant had not come! It was certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days; and, this being the last English territory on Mr. Fogg's route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage to detain him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好！”路路通心里说，“这一来对改良俱乐部那些老爷们可就不大妙了！”他对费克斯的烦恼装着完全没有看见的样子，笑嘻嘻地走上去跟他打了招呼。说实在话，一点也不能怪费克斯咒骂他一再碰上的坏运气。还是没有拘票！显然这份拘票还正在他后面追着转寄，要是能在香港再待上几天，就准会收到了。既然香港是这次旅途上最后一个受英国管辖的地方，要是在此地不能逮捕福克，那么这个贼就一定会远走高飞了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic, he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路路通到了珠江口上的维多利亚港，这里聚集着各国的船只：英国的、法国的、美国的、荷兰的，其中有军舰，有商船，有日本的或是中国的小船，有大帆船、汽艇和舢板，甚至还有“花船”，这些“花船”就象是漂浮在水面上的花坛。路路通在路上还看见一些穿黄色衣服的本地人，这些人年纪都很大。路路通想按中国习惯刮一次脸，就走进了一家中国理发店，他从一位英语讲得相当好的理发师那里才知道刚才看见的那些老人年纪最小的也都在八十岁以上，他们只有到这样高龄，才有权利穿黄衣服，因为黄色是代表皇家的颜色。路路通虽然不了解究竟，不过他觉得这倒挺滑稽。他刮好了脸就走向卡尔纳蒂克停靠的码头。到了那儿，他看见费克斯正独自在河边上徘徊，这路路通一点也不奇怪。这时，这位侦探脸上露着十分失望的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds -- thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves. Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费克斯和路路通现在才知道他们是进了一家专做这些无赖汉、白痴、荒唐鬼、糊涂虫生意的大烟馆。这个死要钱的大英帝国每年要卖给这些人价值两亿六千万法郎的这种害死人的所谓“鸦片”药膏！利用人类最悲惨的恶习赚来的这笔钱是多么污秽呵！中国政府曾经想用严厉的法律来禁绝这种恶习，但是没有成效。吸鸦片的恶习从富有阶级——鸦片首先是专给他们享用的——一直蔓延到了下层阶级，这种灾祸就再也无法禁止了。目前在中华帝国吸鸦片的人随时随地都有。男人女人都贪恋这种可悲的嗜好。他们一旦吸上了瘾，就再也戒不掉了，否则就会产生剧烈的胃疼。烟瘾大的人一天能吸八筒，这种人过不了五年就得死。象这样的大烟馆香港很多，费克斯和路路通怀着喝两杯的念头走进的这个地方不过是其中之一罢了。路路通没有钱，但是他很乐意接受了他朋友的这番“美意”。他提出改一天要回请费克斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout all. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep. At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在费克斯决定采取最后一着了。他决定把一切都告诉路路通。要拖住斐利亚—福克在香港多待几天，也许这是唯一的一个办法了。离开售票处以后，费克斯就请路路通到酒店去喝两杯。路路通看时候还早，也就接受了他的邀请。码头对面就有一家外表很吸引人的酒店。他们两个便走了进去。这是一间装修得很漂亮的大厅。靠里边放着一张板床，上面铺着垫子。床上一个挨一个地睡了好些人。在这大厅里，有三十多个人散坐在那些用藤条编的桌子上。他们有的在大杯地喝着清淡的或浓烈的英国啤酒，有的在喝着英国烧酒：杜松子酒或白兰地。另外，大部分人都在吸着长杆红瓦头的大烟枪，大烟斗上装着玫瑰露合鸦片制成的烟泡。不断有吸烟的人晕过去，倒在桌子底下，于是酒店的伙计就过去拖住他的脚和脖子把他搬到板床上和那些已经晕过去的烟鬼放在一起。晕过去的烟鬼就这样被一个一个地排着放在板床上，共有二十多个，他们那种狼狈不堪的样子真是使人恶心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective. Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him! Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout's hand. He took it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.</div>
