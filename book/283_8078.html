<div class="line_en">Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to invention.-- There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.-- When it was thus settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.-- It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她轻而易举地为哈丽特弄到了伊莎贝拉的邀请。她凑巧有个充分的理由提出这一要求，而不需要编造什么借口。哈丽特有一颗牙齿出了毛病，真想找个牙医看看，而且早就有这个愿望。约翰·奈特利太太就乐于帮忙，不管谁有什么病，她都愿意出力——虽说她喜欢温菲尔德先生胜过喜欢牙医，但她还是非常热心地要来照料哈丽特。姐姐作了这样的安排之后，爱玛便向她的朋友提出了这一建议，发现朋友倒挺容易说通的。哈丽特决定要去。伊莎贝拉邀请她至少住上两个星期。她将坐伍德豪斯先生的马车去。一切都安排好了，也都完成了，哈丽特平平安安地住到了布伦斯威尔广场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before her, one which she only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.-- A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a secret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久她就决定，她要在心理调整的这段时间里，抽出半个小时去看看费尔法克斯小姐，这既是一种责任，又是一种乐趣。她应该去——她渴望去看她。她们目前的处境颇为相似，这就越发激起了要交好的动机。这只是一种秘而不宣的得意。不过，由于意识到两人前景相似，简无论说什么话，她自然会兴致勃勃地听下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.-- No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛非常高兴，若不是从起坐间传来埃尔顿太太的声音，使她欲言又止，只好把满肚子的友好情谊和良好祝愿凝聚在一阵非常热诚的握手之中，那她马上就会表明她并非没话可说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,</div>

However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again.

<div class="line_en">"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to-day on that very account.-- Such a dreadful broiling morning!-- I went over the fields too --(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!-- And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!-- Can you explain it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I met William Larkins," continued Mr. Elton, "as I got near the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not believe him.-- William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the speech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose."</div>

The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!-- My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am sure he must.-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.-- I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.-- She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it."</div>
