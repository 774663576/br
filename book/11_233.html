Those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none can be sure of peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again. or we summon them to the last need of Lorien. Then they may return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle."</div>

And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held now by the Enemy?</div>

<div class="line_en">Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him much, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡对塞勒鹏连连道谢。这项礼物暂时解决了他的问题，不只加快了旅行的脚步，更让他短时间内不需要考虑前进的方向。其他人看起来也放心多了。因为不管前途有多少险阻，顺着河流乘舟而下，总比弯腰驼背面对危险要来得轻松多了。只有山姆抱持着怀疑的态度，他还是认为船就像洪水猛兽一般可；就算他之前经历这么多恐怖的事情，对船只的感觉还是没有好到哪里去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is well," said Celeborn. "Then I will furnish your Company with boats. They must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are places where you will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while. Yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must leave them and the River, and turn west-or east."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”塞勒鹏说：“那么我将送给诸位足够的小舟。你们的交通工具必须够轻、够小，因为如果你们走水路，有些地方将必须扛起小舟才能前进。你们将会遇到萨恩盖宝一带的激流，或者最后会来到拉洛斯瀑布。不只如此，路上还有其他的险阻。小舟至少可以让你们的危险暂时降低，最后你们必须舍弃小舟，往西——或是往东走。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the mastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir. And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当甘道夫还在队伍中的时候，他的原始计划是和波罗莫一起走，带着圣剑去援救刚铎。因为，他相信那场梦境就是故土对他的召唤，伊兰迪尔的子嗣终于有机会得以洗刷污名，击垮索伦的邪恶计划。但是，在甘道夫于摩瑞亚牺牲之后，带领队伍的重责大任就落到他身上。他知道，如果佛罗多拒绝和波罗莫一起走，他也不能够舍弃魔戒。可是，他和队友们除了陪伴着佛罗多一同盲目的走进黑暗中之外，还能提供什么样的帮助呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. Legolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in Lothlorien, and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远征队的成员告退之后就回到帐棚内。勒苟拉斯这次和他们一起行动，因为这是他们在罗斯洛立安的最后一晚，即使有凯兰崔尔女王的保证，他们还是希望能够先开一次会讨论一下未来的行程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good night, my friends!" said Galadriel. "Sleep in peace! Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though you do not see them. Good night!"</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们为了未来要怎么走争论了很久，因为这趟旅程还必须要完成他们携带魔戒千里迢迢前来的目的，但众人最后还是无法做出决定。很明显的，大多数人都希望先去米那斯提力斯，至少暂时可以躲开魔王的紧追不舍。他们其实也愿意跟随队长一起进入魔多的邪异土地上，但佛罗多没有表示意见，而阿拉贡则还在内心挣扎着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir's glance, and he looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate ended. Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The night was growing old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多从波罗莫的眼光中看到了新的、奇怪的情绪起伏，他用力的瞪着波罗莫。很明显，波罗莫最后一句话是违心之论。丢弃它是种愚行，“它”是什么？力量之戒吗？他在会议中也曾经说出类似的话，但当时接受了爱隆的更正。佛罗多看着阿拉贡，但对方似乎陷入了沉思，没有注意到波罗莫的话语，因此，他们的辩论就此终结。梅里和皮聘已经睡着了，而山姆也开始打瞌睡，当他们结束辩论的时候已经深夜了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty," said Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling's thoughts. At length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. "If you wish only to destroy the Ring," he said, "then there is little use in war and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go without force into his domain; and folly to throw away." He paused suddenly, as if he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. "It would be folly to throw lives away, I mean," he ended. "It is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. At least, that is how I see it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“即使只有我一个人，我也必须要回去米那斯提力斯，因为这是我的职责，”波罗莫说。在那之后，他沉默了很长一段时间，眼睛看着佛罗多，彷佛试着了解对方在想些什么。最后，他终于开口了，低沉得彷佛在和自己辩论一般：“如果你想要摧毁魔戒，”他说：“那么武器和战争都没办法帮上你的忙，米那斯提力斯的人们也无法协助你。但是，如果你想要摧毁黑暗大军，那么，你在没有后援的状况下进入魔多只能算是愚勇，而丢弃它更是种愚行。”他突然间停了下来，彷佛意识到自己不经意之间竟然说出了心底的话：“我是说，舍弃自己的性命是种愚行。”他连忙补充道：“这是在守卫坚强的要塞和迎向死亡之间做出选择，至少，我是这样认为的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了早上，当他们正开始打包行李的时候，会说通用语的精灵来到他们的帐棚中，并且带来了许多食物和衣物。食物大多数是一种薄薄的蛋糕，外层烤成淡褐色，内层则是奶油的颜色。金雳拿起一块蛋糕，用怀疑的眼光打量着它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed it is," said Gimli. "Why it is better than the honey-cakes of the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，”金雳说：“天哪，这甚至超越了比翁一族的蜂蜜蛋糕。这可是相当诚心的夸奖啊，因为比翁人是我遇过最厉害的烘烤师傅；而且这些日子以来，他们也不太愿意把蛋糕送给旅行的人。你们可真是慷慨的主人！”">查看中文翻译</div>

The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不客气，但我们还是必须请你们尽量省着点吃，”他们说：“一次只吃一点，只在肚子饿的时候吃，因为这些东西是协助你们度过粮食断绝的情形用的。如果你不弄破外表，让它们像现在一样包在叶子里面，他们可以保持新鲜非常多天。只要一块，就够让一名旅者步行一整天，进行许多耗费体力的工作，即使他是米那斯提力斯的高壮人类也不例外。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes they had brought. For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim wove. It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars. Each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not know what you mean by that," answered the leader of the Elves. "They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lorien that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people."</div>

<div class="line_en">They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed glittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters, deep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lorien.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们大概走了十哩，时间快到中午时，眼前出现一座绿色的高墙。在通过上面的一个开口之后，一行人突然间离开了树林。他们眼前是一连串反射着灿烂陽光的草地，上面点缀着金光闪闪的伊拉诺花。这块草地刚好界在两条河之间，右边是银光闪耀的银光河西行，左边则是大河宽广幽深的江水往东流。在更远处的河岸边，依旧有森林继续往南方延伸，但紧靠河边的位置都显得十分荒凉，在罗瑞安的土地之外没有任何的梅隆树生长。">查看中文翻译</div>

At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and eastwards, towards the shores of the River.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood. By it were moored many boats and barges. Some were brightly painted, and shone with silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. Three small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves stowed their goods. And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat. Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the elven-cloaks.</div>

In this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed. The boats were moved and steered with short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready Aragorn led them on a trial up the Silverlode. The current was swift and they went forward slowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and looking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the trees drew down to the river's brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream. The air was very bright and still, and there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.</div>

The water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang.

There it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil.

<div class="line_en">The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. "It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues," she said; "yet that is not true of Gimli.

<div class="line_en">Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli's hand. "These words shall go with the gift," she said. "I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope.

<div class="line_en">Even as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the Great River, and their boats turned and began to speed southwards. Soon the white form of the Lady was small and distant. She shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on the following wind came the sound of her voice singing. But now she sang in the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not understand the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在他们的目光下，银光河就这么和大河安都因汇流，小舟开始快速地朝着南方开去。很快的，女皇的白色身影就渐渐缩小，她看起来像是西沉的太陽下一扇美丽的水晶窗户，或者是从远方眺望的一座美丽湖泊。在佛罗多的眼中，彷佛看见她举起手来挥舞，向众人做最后的告别，她清澈甜美的声音飘过重重河水，传来她的歌声。但这次，她所使用的是海的另一端精灵的语言，佛罗多一个字也听不懂，一点也没有安心的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow noon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in the boats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lorien with long grey poles thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood alone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away from them. For so it seemed to them: Lorien was slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on to forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless world.</div>

Who now shall refill the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of the Stars, from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkness lies on the foaming waves between us, and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for ever.

<div class="line_en">"Maybe," said Gimli; "and I thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart desires.

<div class="line_en">So the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the River flowed without a sound. No voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey and starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree-roots and driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep.</div>
