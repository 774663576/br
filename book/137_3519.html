<div class="line_en">A few moments later our poet found himself in a tiny arched chamber, very cosy, very warm, seated at a table which appeared to ask nothing better than to make some loans from a larder hanging near by, having a good bed in prospect, and alone with a pretty girl. The adventure smacked of enchantment. He began seriously to take himself for a personage in a fairy tale; he cast his eyes about him from time to time to time, as though to see if the chariot of fire, harnessed to two-winged chimeras, which alone could have so rapidly transported him from Tartarus to Paradise, were still there. At times, also, he fixed his eyes obstinately upon the holes in his doublet, in order to cling to reality, and not lose the ground from under his feet completely. His reason, tossed about in imaginary space, now hung only by this thread.</div>

<div class="line_en">You have been a child, reader, and you would, perhaps, be very happy to be one still. It is quite certain that you have not, more than once (and for my part, I have passed whole days, the best employed of my life, at it) followed from thicket to thicket, by the side of running water, on a sunny day, a beautiful green or blue dragon-fly, breaking its flight in abrupt angles, and kissing the tips of all the branches. You recollect with what amorous curiosity your thought and your gaze were riveted upon this little whirlwind, hissing and humming with wings of purple and azure, in the midst of which floated an imperceptible body, veiled by the very rapidity of its movement. The aerial being which was dimly outlined amid this quivering of wings, appeared to you chimerical, imaginary, impossible to touch, impossible to see. But when, at length, the dragon-fly alighted on the tip of a reed, and, holding your breath the while, you were able to examine the long, gauze wings, the long enamel robe, the two globes of crystal, what astonishment you felt, and what fear lest you should again behold the form disappear into a shade, and the creature into a chimera! Recall these impressions, and you will readily appreciate what Gringoire felt on contemplating, beneath her visible and palpable form, that Esmeralda of whom, up to that time, he had only caught a glimpse, amidst a whirlwind of dance, song, and tumult.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诸位读者，你们都有过童年，或者，很幸运，现在还是儿童。你们可能不止一次，（我自己，曾经整天整天那样，那是我一生中最好的日子，）在阳光灿烂的日子，沿着潺潺流水，从一个草丛到一个草丛，追赶美丽的蓝蜻蜓或绿蜻蜓：它蹁跹急旋，轻吻着每一树梢。你们还记得，你们是怎样满怀柔情，好奇地想着、看着那朱红色的、天蓝色的翅膀沙沙，营营，轻轻旋转，飘忽的形体不可捉摸，正是由于运动极其迅速而难于觉察。翅膀的颤动中隐约显出的那空灵之物，在你看来，是多么虚渺，纯属想象，不可触知，无法看见。但是，蜻蜓一旦栖歇在芦苇尖上，你们一旦能够屏息观察它那薄纱长翼、那变幻色彩的长袍、那两颗水晶眼珠，你们怎能不惊讶，怎能不担心它的形体重新变成幻影，它的生命重新化作空幻！你们回想一下这些印象，就可以理解格兰古瓦此刻的感受：他透过可以看见、可以触知的形体，观赏着以往只是通过歌舞喧嚣的旋涡隐约瞥见过的那个爱斯美腊达。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sinking deeper and deeper into his revery: "So this," he said to himself, following her vaguely with his eyes, "is la Esmeralda! a celestial creature! a street dancer! so much, and so little! 'Twas she who dealt the death-blow to my mystery this morning, 'tis she who saves my life this evening! My evil genius! My good angel! A pretty woman, on my word! and who must needs love me madly to have taken me in that fashion.

<div class="line_en">The gypsy's corsage slipped through his hands like the skin of an eel. She bounded from one end of the tiny room to the other, stooped down, and raised herself again, with a little poniard in her hand, before Gringoire had even had time to see whence the poniard came; proud and angry, with swelling lips and inflated nostrils, her cheeks as red as an api apple, and her eyes darting lightnings. At the same time, the white goat placed itself in front of her, and presented to Gringoire a hostile front, bristling with two pretty horns, gilded and very sharp. All this took place in the twinkling of an eye.</div>

<div class="line_en">The gypsy did not reply. She made her disdainful little grimace, drew up her head like a bird, then burst out laughing, and the tiny poniard disappeared as it had come, without Gringoire being able to see where the wasp concealed its sting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉卜赛姑娘不答理。她噘噘嘴，又作出那种高傲的娇态，小鸟似的把头一扬，大笑起来。那把可爱的匕首倏然不见，像出现时那样迅速，格兰古瓦未能看明白蜜蜂的刺又是怎样收藏起来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A moment later, there stood upon the table a loaf of rye bread, a slice of bacon, some wrinkled apples and a jug of beer. Gringoire began to eat eagerly. One would have said, to hear the furious clashing of his iron fork and his earthenware plate, that all his love had turned to appetite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，桌上就有了一块黑面包、一小片猪油、几只干瘪了的苹果、一罐子麦酒。格兰古瓦狼吞虎咽起来，铁叉和瓦盆碰得咣咣直响，仿佛他整个的情欲都已化作食欲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The truth is, Gringoire was, like M. Despreaux, "not very voluptuous." He did not belong to that chevalier and musketeer species, who take young girls by assault. In the matter of love, as in all other affairs, he willingly assented to temporizing and adjusting terms; and a good supper, and an amiable tête-a-tête appeared to him, especially when he was hungry, an excellent interlude between the prologue and the catastrophe of a love adventure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，格兰古瓦也跟德普瑞奥（81）先生一样，“很不贪恋女色”。他并不是那种逼迫女人顺从的骑士或火枪手。在爱情方面，他也像对待其他一样，乐意坚持缓进，采取平和手段。在他看来，好好吃顿晚饭，而且有个可爱的人儿作陪，尤其在他饥肠辘辘的时候，这正好充作一场艳遇的序幕和结局之间的美妙幕间休息。【注：（81）德普瑞奥，即著名法国诗人、讽刺文作家、文艺理论家波瓦洛（1636—1711）。他有一篇杂文《对女性的非难》，雨果大概是认为该文对女性大不敬，故意说他“很不贪恋女色”，其实波瓦洛只是指责当时的某些时髦女性。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The street dancer had a beauty as she spoke thus, that struck Gringoire singularly, and seemed to him in perfect keeping with the almost oriental exaltation of her words. Her pure, red lips half smiled; her serene and candid brow became troubled, at intervals, under her thoughts, like a mirror under the breath; and from beneath her long, drooping, black eyelashes, there escaped a sort of ineffable light, which gave to her profile that ideal serenity which Raphael found at the mystic point of intersection of virginity, maternity, and divinity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这街头献舞的姑娘说这话的时候，格外艳丽，格兰古瓦感动异常。在他看来，这样的美貌正是同她言词的几乎东方式的（82）魅力完全协调的。她那纯洁的鲜红嘴唇微微泛起微笑，她那率真而又端庄的容颜由于思虑不时显得暗淡，就好像镜子上哈了一口气似的；黑黑长长的睫毛低垂，时时射出无可形容的光芒，使她整个面貌显得那样芬芳沁人，——正是后世拉斐尔把处女的纯洁、母性的美丽和神祇的圣明，神秘地交汇糅合恰到好处而获致的典范。【注：（82）按西方人的习惯看法，所谓“东方式的”代表着神秘、语言富于隐喻之类。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Naughty girl!" retorted the poet. "Never mind, you shall not provoke me. Wait, perhaps you will love me more when you know me better; and then, you have told me your story with so much confidence, that I owe you a little of mine. You must know, then, that my name is Pierre Gringoire, and that I am a son of the farmer of the notary's office of Gonesse. My father was hung by the Burgundians, and my mother disembowelled by the Picards, at the siege of Paris, twenty years ago. At six years of age, therefore, I was an orphan, without a sole to my foot except the pavements of Paris. I do not know how I passed the interval from six to sixteen. A fruit dealer gave me a plum here, a baker flung me a crust there; in the evening I got myself taken up by the watch, who threw me into prison, and there I found a bundle of straw. All this did not prevent my growing up and growing thin, as you see. In the winter I warmed myself in the sun, under the porch of the Hôtel de Sens, and I thought it very ridiculous that the fire on Saint John's Day was reserved for the dog days. At sixteen, I wished to choose a calling. I tried all in succession. I became a soldier; but I was not brave enough. I became a monk; but I was not sufficiently devout; and then I'm a bad hand at drinking. In despair, I became an apprentice of the woodcutters, but I was not strong enough; I had more of an inclination to become a schoolmaster; 'tis true that I did not know how to read, but that's no reason. I perceived at the end of a certain time, that I lacked something in every direction; and seeing that I was good for nothing, of my own free will I became a poet and rhymester. That is a trade which one can always adopt when one is a vagabond, and it's better than stealing, as some young brigands of my acquaintance advised me to do. One day I met by luck, Dom Claude Frollo, the reverend archdeacon of Notre-Dame. He took an interest in me, and it is to him that I to-day owe it that I am a veritable man of letters, who knows Latin from the de Officiis of Cicero to the mortuology of the Celestine Fathers, and a barbarian neither in scholastics, nor in politics, nor in rhythmics, that sophism of sophisms. I am the author of the Mystery which was presented to-day with great triumph and a great concourse of populace, in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice. I have also made a book which will contain six hundred pages, on the wonderful comet of 1465, which sent one man mad. I have enjoyed still other successes. Being somewhat of an artillery carpenter, I lent a hand to Jean Mangue's great bombard, which burst, as you know, on the day when it was tested, on the Pont de Charenton, and killed four and twenty curious spectators. You see that I am not a bad match in marriage. I know a great many sorts of very engaging tricks, which I will teach your goat; for example, to mimic the Bishop of Paris, that cursed Pharisee whose mill wheels splash passers-by the whole length of the Pont aux Meuniers. And then my mystery will bring me in a great deal of coined money, if they will only pay me. And finally, I am at your orders, I and my wits, and my science and my letters, ready to live with you, damsel, as it shall please you, chastely or joyously; husband and wife, if you see fit; brother and sister, if you think that better."</div>
