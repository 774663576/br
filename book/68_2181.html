<div class="line_en">"Why should I feel sorry for her? She has had a lucky escape. And I suspect that she has not really given him up at all. I think it is quite possible that they have made an arrangement to wait; and when I am dead, he will come back, and then she will marry him."</div>

<div class="line_en">No one ever learnt the truth about the end of Catherine's engagement. Catherine never spoke about it, keeping her secret even from Mrs Almond, who was very kind to her after Morris Townsend had left New York.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有人知道凯瑟琳解除婚约的真相。凯瑟琳对此讳莫如深，连阿尔蒙德夫人都不知道她的秘密，莫里斯·汤森离开纽约后阿尔蒙德夫人对她特别好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many years passed; years in which Catherine received more than a few offers of marriage. She refused them all, and though the name Morris Townsend was never mentioned in Washington Square, Doctor Sloper still suspected that his daughter was secretly waiting for him. "If she is not, why doesn't she marry?" he asked himself. This idea grew stronger as he got older, and one day the Doctor said something to his daughter that surprised her very much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多年过去了；期间凯瑟琳收到过不少求婚。她统统拒绝了，虽然在华盛顿广场莫里斯·汤森的名字再也没有被提起过，斯洛珀医生仍然怀疑他的女儿在秘密地等待着他。“如果她没在等，那她为什么不结婚呢？”他问自己。他越上年纪，这种想法就越强烈，结果有一天医生对女儿说了一些令她十分吃惊的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outwardly, Catherine seemed unchanged, but the fact was that she had been deeply hurt. Nothing could ever take away the pain that Morris had caused her, and nothing could ever make her feel towards her father as she had felt when she was younger.</div>

<div class="line_en">A year later Doctor Sloper died after a three-week illness. The will he had changed shortly before his death now left Catherine only a fifth of his property. Mrs Penniman thought that this was cruel and unjust, but Catherine was neither surprised nor unhappy about the new will. "I like it very much," she told her aunt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年后，斯洛珀医生被病痛折磨了三个星期之后去世了。去世前不久他更改了遗嘱，只给凯瑟琳留下了五分之一的财产。彭尼曼夫人觉得这太绝情，而且不公平，但是凯瑟琳对于新遗嘱既没有感到惊讶也没有感到不高兴。“我很喜欢它。”她告诉她姑姑。">查看中文翻译</div>

I believe he married some lady somewhere in Europe. She died soon afterwards -- as he said to me, she only passed through his life. The first thing he did was to ask me about you. He had heard you had never married; he seemed very much interested about that. He said you had been the real romance in his life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我料到你就会那么说。”彭尼曼夫人说道，“我在玛丽安家里遇见了他，而他们非常担心你会在那里碰到他。我想那正是他去那里的原因。他很想见你。”凯瑟琳没有回答，于是彭尼曼夫人又继续说：“他还是很英俊，虽然他现在看起来当然是老了一些。我想他是在欧洲的什么地方和某个女人结了婚。那个女人没过多久就死了——他是这么跟我说的，她只是他生命中的过客。他首先向我问起了你。他听说你一直没有结婚；他好像对此很感兴趣。他说你是他生命中真正的爱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
