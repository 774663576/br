<div class="line_en">It was dusk and the red priest had lit his nightfire in the great iron brazier amidships as the crew gathered round to pray. Moqorro's voice was a bass drum that seemed to boom from somewhere deep within his massive torso. "We thank you for your sun that keeps us warm," he prayed. "We thank you for your stars that watch over us as we sail this cold black sea." A huge man, taller than Ser Jorah and wide enough to make two of him, the priest wore scarlet robes embroidered at sleeve and hem and collar with orange satin flames. His skin was black as pitch, his hair as white as snow; the flames tattooed across his cheeks and brow yellow and orange. His iron staff was as tall as he was and crowned with a dragon's head; when he stamped its butt upon the deck, the dragon's maw spat crackling green flame.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Selaesori Qhoran was a wallowing tub of five hundred tons, with a deep hold, high castles fore and aft, and a single mast between. At her forecastle stood a grotesque figurehead, some worm-eaten wooden eminence with a constipated look and a scroll tucked up under one arm. Tyrion had never seen an uglier ship. Her crew was no prettier. Her captain, a mean-mouthed, flinty, kettle-bellied man with close-set, greedy eyes, was a bad cyvasse player and a worse loser. Under him served four mates, freedmen all, and fifty slaves bound to the ship, each with a crude version of the cog's figurehead tattooed upon one cheek. No-Nose, the sailors liked to call Tyrion, no matter how many times he told them his name was Hugor Hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Selaesori Qhoran号是一艘500吨级的颠簸的有着深深的船舱和高高的前后船楼的单桅慢船。在她的前船楼上立着一座怪诞的船首像，这个虫蛀的木雕大人物看上去似乎患了便秘，其中一只胳膊下塞着一个卷轴。提利昂再没看过比她更丑的船了，但是似乎她的船员们也不比她号多少。她的船长，一个说话刻薄的生硬的壶肚的男人，长着一对瞳距甚小的贪婪的眼睛，而且是个糟糕的锡瓦斯棋玩家以及一个更糟的输家。他手下有四个大副和50个船奴，每个人的一边脸颊上都纹着个粗糙的本船船首像的形状（the cog’s figurehead）。无论提利昂怎么提醒他们他的名字叫雨果·希山，那群人依旧喜欢叫提利昂“没鼻子”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew better than to voice such thoughts aloud. Tyrion Lannister had no use for any god, but on this ship it was wise to show a certain respect for red R'hllor. Jorah Mormont had removed Tyron's chains and fetters once they were safely under way, and the dwarf did not wish to give him cause to clap them on again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他知道有比大声说出这些想法更好的办法。提里昂·兰尼斯特不需要神灵。但是在这艘船上对拉赫洛致以一定的敬意依旧是明智之举。乔拉·莫尔蒙自他们航行稳定后就已经解除了提利昂的镣铐，他可不准备再给他什么理由重新戴上它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My lady," Tyrion called softly. In truth, she was no lady, but he could not bring himself to mouth that silly name of hers, and he was not about to call her girl or dwarf.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three of the mates and more than three-quarters of the crew were fervent worshipers of the Lord of Light. Tyrion was less certain about the captain, who always emerged for the evening prayers but took no other part in them. But Moqorro was the true master of the Selaesori Qhoran, at least for this voyage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四分之三的大副还有多于四分之三的船员都是光之王的狂热信徒。提利昂不太确定那个船长的信仰，他总在晚祷时出席但是却不参与其他人的行为。但是莫阔罗才是Selaesori Qhoran号的真正主人，至少在这趟旅行是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lord of Light, bless your slave Moqorro, and light his way in the dark places of the world," the red priest boomed. "And defend your righteous slave Benerro. Grant him courage. Grant him wisdom. Fill his heart with fire."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“光之王，祝福您的奴仆莫阔罗吧，在世界的黑暗中为他照亮道路，”红袍僧突然提高嗓音。“并保卫您忠实的奴仆班奈罗，赐予他勇气，赐予他智慧，用火焰充满他的心灵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was when Tyrion noticed Penny, watching the mummery from the steep wooden stair that led down beneath the sterncastle. She stood on one of the lower steps, so only the top of her head was visible. Beneath her hood her eyes shone big and white in the light of the nightfire. She had her dog with her, the big grey hound she rode in the mock jousts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时提利昂注意到了佩妮，她正在通往后船楼下的木质楼梯上看着那荒谬的仪式。她站在一个低处的台阶上，所以只露出了她的脑袋。在夜火的光芒下她兜帽下的大眼睛闪耀着白色的光芒。她带着她的狗，那只在小丑格斗时她骑的灰色大猎犬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="见到我就好比在她的伤口上撒盐。他们希望砍掉我的脑袋但不幸的是那是她哥哥的，而我却坐在这里像个该死的兽形滴水嘴，流出的皆是些空洞的安慰。换做我是她，除了把我丢到海里别无他求。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No." And quick as that she was gone again, retreating back below to the cabin she shared with her dog and sow. Tyrion could not fault her. The crew of the Selaesori Qhoran had been pleased enough when he first came on board; a dwarf was good luck, after all. His head had been rubbed so often and so vigorously that it was a wonder he wasn't bald. But Penny had met with a more mixed reaction. She might be a dwarf, but she was also a woman, and women were bad luck aboard ship. For every man who tried to rub her head, there were three who muttered maledictions under their breath when she went by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”她就像她转身离去那样飞快的拒绝了，退回她下面她和她的猪和狗一起待的那个舱位。提利昂没法责备她，那些Selaesori Qhoran号的船员在他上船时已经娱乐够了；毕竟一个侏儒象征着好运。他的头不停地被狠狠揉搓，而他还没成秃子称得上是一个奇迹。但是对待佩妮的反应就有些复杂了。她是个侏儒没错，但她同时也是个女人，而带女人船会招致厄运。相对于每一个试图揉她脑袋的人来说，就有三个人在她经过时低声咒骂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt nothing but pity for the girl. She did not deserve the horror visited on her in Volantis, any more than her brother had. The last time he had seen her, just before they left port, her eyes had been raw from crying, two ghastly red holes in a wan, pale face. By the time they raised sail she had locked herself in her cabin with her dog and her pig, but at night they could hear her weeping. Only yesterday he had heard one of the mates say that they ought to throw her overboard before her tears could swamp the ship. Tyrion was not entirely sure he had been japing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他除了对女孩报以遗憾外还有什么呢？他不应在瓦兰提斯经历那种恐怖，甚至比她哥哥所受的要更甚。上次他看见她还是在他们离港前，她双眼因为痛哭而红肿，像是两团红色的圆洞嵌在她苍白无血色的脸上。一直到他们扬帆起航前她一直把自己锁在舱里，和她的狗猪呆在一块，但是晚上他们能听到她的啜泣声。就是昨天他还听到一个大副说他们应该在她的眼泪淹了船之前把她丢下海。提利昂不太确定他是不是在开玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion squatted across from him and warmed his hands against the night's chill. Moqorro took no notice of him for several moments. He was staring into the flickering flames, lost in some vision. Does he see days yet to come, as he claims? If so, that was a fearsome gift. After a time the priest raised his eyes to meet the dwarf's. "Hugor Hill," he said, inclining his head in a solemn nod. "Have you come to pray with me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂蹲在他对面烤手以应对夜寒。莫阔罗则一直盯着摇摆的火焰，陷在某种思绪当中。他能像他声称的那样看见未来么？若是这样的话，那真是个可怕的天赋。过了好一会儿神僧抬起眼直接对上了提利昂的。“雨果·希山，”他说，严肃地微微颔首。“你是来和我一起祈祷的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the evening prayers had ended and the ship's crew had once again dispersed, some to their watch and others to food and rum and hammocks, Moqorro remained beside his nightfire, as he did every night.

<div class="line_cn" title="当晚祷结束而船员们又再一次散开回到他们的岗位或者去填饱肚子喝点朗姆酒或直接翻回吊床休息，莫阔罗依旧如他每晚所作的一样待在夜火旁边。这个红袍僧白天休息而在黑暗的时段中则一直清醒的看顾他神圣的火焰，这样在黎明时太阳才会回归他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dragons," Moqorro said in the Common Tongue of Westeros. He spoke it very well, with hardly a trace of accent. No doubt that was one reason the high priest Benerro had chosen him to bring the faith of R'hllor to Daenerys Targaryen. "Dragons old and young, true and false, bright and dark. And you. A small man with a big shadow, snarling in the midst of all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“龙们，”莫阔罗用维斯特洛伊通用语说。他说的很好几乎听不出一丝口音。毫无疑问这是大神僧班奈罗选择他将拉赫洛的信仰传递给丹妮莉丝·坦格利安的原因之一。“年龄大的龙与年纪小的龙，真龙与伪龙，光敏与黑暗。而你，一个有着巨影的小个子男人，在他们中间咆哮。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And the nights were worse. Tyrion slept badly at the best of times, and this was far from that. Sleep meant dreams as like as not, and in his dreams the Sorrows waited, and a stony king with his father's face. That left him with the beggar's choice of climbing up into his hammock and listening to Jorah Mormont snore beneath him, or remaining abovedecks to contemplate the sea. On moonless nights the water was as black as maester's ink, from horizon to horizon. Dark and deep and forbidding, beautiful in a chilly sort of way, but when he looked at it too long Tyrion found himself musing on how easy it would be to slip over the gunwale and drop down into that darkness. One very small splash, and the pathetic little tale that was his life would soon be done. But what if there is a hell and my father's waiting for me?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上就更糟了，提利昂即使在最好的时间也睡眠糟糕，更别提现在远非如此。睡觉意味着会做梦，无论想不想，而他的伤心地总在他的梦里等着他，还有一个长着他父亲脸庞的冷酷国王。这让他不得不以乞丐的选择爬进他的吊床听着乔拉·莫尔蒙在他下面打呼噜或者在待在甲板上对大海凝神思考。在无月的夜晚，四围天际，海水黑得如同学士的墨水。冷峻黢黑深邃，从寒冷的角度看还挺美，但是当他看得过久就会发现自己开始想，要是翻过船缘跳进那团黑暗是多么的容易。一声小小的水花声，然后那个可悲的小小传说就完了，而那便是他的一生。但若真有地狱而我父亲在等着我的话呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Life aboard the Selaesori Qhoran was nothing if not tedious, Tyrion had found. The most exciting part of his day was pricking his toes and fingers with a knife. On the river there had been wonders to behold: giant turtles, ruined cities, stone men, naked septas. One never knew what might be lurking around the next bend. The days and nights at sea were all the same. Leaving Volantis, the cog had sailed within sight of land at first, so Tyrion could gaze at passing headlands, watch clouds of seabirds rise from stony cliffs and crumbling watchtowers, count bare brown islands as they slipped past. He saw many other ships as well: fishing boats, lumbering merchantmen, proud galleys with their oars lashing the waves into white foam. But once they struck out into deeper waters, there was only sea and sky, air and water. The water looked like water. The sky looked like sky. Sometimes there was a cloud. Too much blue.</div>

<div class="line_en">The best part of each evening was supper. The food was not especially good, but it was plentiful, so that was where the dwarf went next. The galley where he took his meals was a cramped and uncomfortable space, with a ceiling so low that the taller passengers were always in danger of cracking their heads, a hazard the strapping slave soldiers of the Fiery Hand seemed particularly prone to. As much as Tyrion enjoyed sniggering at that, he had come to prefer taking his meals alone. Sitting at a crowded table with men who did not share a common language with you, listening to them talk and jape whilst understanding none of it, had quickly grown wearisome. Particularly since he always found himself wondering if the japes and laughter were directed at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每晚的最佳时光便是晚餐了。吃的并不算太好，但至少品种丰富，所以那便是侏儒接下来要去的地方。他解决他三餐的厨房是个狭小的不太舒服的场所，有着将高一点的旅客置于随时碰头危险的过低的天花板，而那些高大的炎之手的奴隶士兵看起来尤其可能发生这类危险。虽然提利昂对那番景象窃笑一番，他还是喜欢独自进餐。坐在一个挤满了人的桌上听着和你不说一种语言的人们玩笑交谈却什么也听不懂，这很快就让人厌烦了。尤其当他发现那些玩笑和嘲笑似乎都指向他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The galley was also where the ship's books were kept. Her captain being an especially bookish man, she carried three -- a collection of nautical poetry that went from bad to worse, a well-thumbed tome about the erotic adventures of a young slave girl in a Lysene pillow house, and the fourth and final volume of The Life of the Triarch Belicho, a famous Volantene patriot whose unbroken succession of conquests and triumphs ended rather abruptly when he was eaten by giants. Tyrion had finished them all by their third day at sea. Then, for lack of any other books, he started reading them again. The slave girl's story was the worst written but the most engrossing, and that was the one he took down this evening to see him through a supper of buttered beets, cold fish stew, and biscuits that could have been used to drive nails.</div>

My brother thought that would be far enough, but it wasn't. We knew a juggler there. For years and years he would juggle every day by the Fountain of the Drunken God. He was old, so his hands were not as deft as they had been, and sometimes he would drop his balls and chase them across the square, but the Tyroshi would laugh and throw him coins all the same. Then one morning we heard that his body had been found at the Temple of Trios. Trios has three heads, and there's a big statue of him beside the temple doors.

<div class="line_en">Tyrion Lannister had scant experience with other dwarfs. His lord father had not welcomed any reminders of his son's deformities, and such mummers as featured little folk in their troupes soon learned to stay away from Lannisport and Casterly Rock, at the risk of his displeasure. Growing up, Tyrion heard reports of a dwarf jester at the seat of the Dornish Lord Fowler, a dwarf maester in service on the Fingers, and a female dwarf amongst the silent sisters, but he never felt the least need to seek them out. Less reliable tales also reached his ears, of a dwarf witch who haunted a hill in the riverlands, and a dwarf whore in King's Landing renowned for coupling with dogs. His own sweet sister had told him of the last, even offering to find him a bitch in heat if he cared to try it out. When he asked politely if she were referring to herself, Cersei had thrown a cup of wine in his face. That was red, as I recall, and this is gold. Tyrion mopped at his face with a sleeve.

It was about then that the crew started hauling down the canvas. Tyrion was underfoot amid-ships, so he climbed the forecastle and hunkered down, savoring the lash of cold rain on his cheeks. The cog went up and down, bucking more wildly than any horse he'd ever ridden, lifting with each wave before sliding down into the troughs between, jarring him to the bones.
