<div class="line_en">"She eats nothing but raw onions," Sam would say, holding up a white onion between his dark fingers. "It's nature's magic vegetable. If a person ate nothing but raw onions, he could live to be two hundred years old."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Onions! Sweet, fresh onions!" Sam would call, as he and his donkey, Mary Lou, walked up and down the dirt roads of Green Lake. Mary Lou pulled a cart full of onions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨姆和他那只叫玛丽·露的驴在翠湖镇的泥路上来来回回地走动时，他总是这样叫卖着：“洋葱！香甜、新鲜的洋葱！”玛丽·露拉着满满一车洋葱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a doctor in the town of Green Lake, one hundred and ten years ago. His name was Dr. Hawthorn. And whenever people got sick, they would go see Doc Hawthorn. But they would also see Sam, the onion man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一百一十年前，翠湖镇有一个医生，名叫霍桑。镇上的人一有个头疼脑热的，就会去找他。但他们也会去找萨姆，一个卖洋葱的小贩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam's onion field was somewhere on the other side of the lake. Once or twice a week he would row across the lake and pick a new batch to fill the cart. Sam had big strong arms, but it would still take all day for him to row across the lake and another day for him to return. Most of the time he would leave Mary Lou in a shed, which the Walkers let him use at no charge, but sometimes he would take Mary Lou on his boat with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨姆的洋葱田就在湖对岸，每个星期他总有一到两次划着船去挖满满一车新鲜的洋葱回来。萨姆有两条粗壮的胳膊，但他还是得划上一整天才能到对岸，然后再花上一整天划回来。大多数时候，他把玛丽·露留在沃克尔家的一间小棚屋里。小棚屋是沃克尔家允许他免费使用的，但是偶尔他也会带着玛丽·露一起上船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam claimed that Mary Lou was almost fifty years old, which was, and still is, extraordinarily old for a donkey.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam always gave the same advice: "Eat plenty of onions."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨姆总是提出一个建议：“多吃洋葱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He also had many different ointments, lotions, syrups, and pastes all made out of onion juice and different parts of the onion plant. This one cured asthma. That one was for warts and pimples. Another was a remedy for arthritis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还有很多形形色色的软膏、乳液、糖浆和糊糊，这些东西全都是用洋葱汁和洋葱的各个部位加工制成的。有一种可以治哮喘，另外一种对疣子和粉刺有效，还有一种是专门针对关节炎的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He said that onions were good for the digestion, the liver, the stomach, the lungs, the heart, and the brain. "If you don't believe me, just look at old Mary Lou here. She's never been sick a day in her life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说洋葱有助于消化，对肝、胃、肺、心脏和大脑都很有益。“要是不相信我说的，那就瞧瞧玛丽·露。它这辈子还从来没闹过病呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He even had a special ointment which he claimed would cure baldness. "Just rub it on your husband's head every night when he's sleeping, Mrs. Collingwood, and soon his hair will be as thick and as long as Mary Lou's tail."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨姆甚至还有一种特殊的软膏，据他说可以治疗秃顶。“科林伍德太太，每晚你先生睡觉时，你只要在他的脑袋上擦点这个，很快他的头发就会像玛丽·露的尾巴一样又密又长。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Doc Hawthorn did not resent Sam. The folks of Green Lake were afraid to take chances. They would get regular medicine from Doc Hawthorn and onion concoctions from Sam. After they got over their illness, no one could be sure, not even Doc Hawthorn, which of the two treatments had done the trick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍桑先生并不恨萨姆。翠湖镇的老老少少害怕冒险，他们既需要霍桑医生的常规药物，也需要萨姆的洋葱调和物。一旦痊愈，谁都不清楚究竟是谁的药方起了作用，就连霍桑医生自己也没有十足的把握。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Katherine usually stayed in the schoolhouse, grading papers and such, while Sam worked on the roof. She enjoyed what little conversation they were able to have, shouting up and down to each other. She was surprised by his interest in poetry.

<div class="line_cn" title="萨姆在屋顶上忙活的时候，凯瑟琳小姐通常待在教室里批改作业。她喜欢跟萨姆聊上几句，他俩一上一下来来回回地喊话。萨姆对诗歌很感兴趣，这令凯瑟琳小姐有些惊讶。有时候萨姆休息，凯瑟琳小姐会为他读上一首诗。不止一次，当她刚开口朗诵爱伦·坡（8）或是朗费罗（9）的诗时，接下来就听着他凭记忆背诵完整首诗。【注：（8）埃德加·爱伦·坡（1809—1849），美国作家、诗人、编者与文学评论家，被尊崇是美国浪漫主义运动要角之一。（9）亨利·沃兹沃思·朗费罗（1807—1882），美国诗人、翻译家。】">查看中文翻译</div>
