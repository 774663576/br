<div class="line_en">When we had tied the boat up by one of the islands, it was still early. George said it would be a good idea to have a really excellent supper. He said we could use all kinds of things, and all the bits of food we had left. We could make it really interesting, and we could put everything into one big pan together. George said he would show us how to do it.</div>

<div class="line_en">After lunch, we moved on to Wargrave and Shiplake, and then to Sonning. We got out of the boat there, and we walked about for an hour or more. It was too late then to go on past Reading, so we decided to go back to one of the Shiplake islands. We would spend the night there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午饭之后，我们继续驶向沃格雷夫和希普雷克，然后再去松宁。在那里下了船，游览了一个小时左右。来不及赶到雷丁了，所以我们决定回到希普雷克，在那里找一个小岛过夜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We liked this idea, so George collected wood to make a fire. Harris and I started to prepare the potatoes. This became a very big job. We began quite happily. However, by the time we had finished our first potato, we were feeling very miserable. There was almost no potato left. George came and looked at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个主意太妙了。乔治便去找木头生火，哈里斯和我准备弄土豆。真没想到工程如此浩大。刚开始的时候我们还挺高兴，可是刚削完第一个土豆，我们就已经痛苦不堪了。一个土豆几乎削得没剩多少了。乔治走过来一看，说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a very good meal. It was different from other meals. The potatoes were a bit hard, but we had good teeth, so it did not really matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">After supper Harris was rather disagreeable -- I think it was the meal which caused this. He is not used to such rich food. George and I decided to go for a walk in Henley, but we left Harris in the boat. He said he was going to have a glass of whisky, smoke his pipe, and then get the boat ready for the night. We were on an island, so when we came back we would shout from the river bank. Then Harris would come in the boat and get us. When we left, we said to him,'Don't go to sleep!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈里斯吃罢晚饭变得有些不太友好——我想这一定是那顿饭在作怪，他还不适应那么丰盛的食物。乔治和我打算到亨利城里面转一转，把哈里斯留在船上。他说他要喝一杯威士忌，抽斗烟，再把船弄好，准备过夜。我们停在一个岛上，所以回来的时候只要在岸上喊上一声，哈里斯就把船摇过来接我们。临行的时候，我们叮嘱他：“可别睡着了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">George said it was stupid to have only four potatoes, so we washed about six more. Then we put them in the pan without doing anything else to them. We also put in some carrots and other vegetables. But George looked at it, and he said there was not enough. So then we got out both the food baskets. We took out all the bits of things that were left, and we put them in, too. In fact, we put in everything we could find. I remember that Montmorency watched all this, and he looked very thoughtful. Then he walked away. He came back a few minutes later with a dead rat in his mouth. He wanted to give it to us for the meal. We did not know if he really wanted to put it in the pan, or if he wanted to tell us what he thought about the meal. Harris said he thought it would be all right to put the rat in. However, George did not want to try anything new.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治说只有四个土豆也太不象话了，因此我们又洗了六个，没削没刮，就那么放在锅里，又放了一些胡萝卜和其它蔬菜。可是乔治看看，说还是不够。我们只好把两个装食物的篮子都拿出来了，把剩下的所有的东西都放进锅里。说实在的，我们把能找到的都放进去了。我还记得在整个烹饪过程中，“元帅”一直心事重重地看着，又走开了。过了一会儿，他叼着一只死耗子回来了，想给我们的晚餐做点贡献。到底它是真的想把死耗子放进锅里呢，还是想告诉我们这是它对晚餐的看法呢，我们不得而知。哈里斯说放进去很好，可是乔治不想搞什么新的试验。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After some time, we found the river, and that made us happy. We knew that we were going the right way. We passed Shiplake at a quarter to twelve, and then George said, quite slowly. ' You don't remember which island it was, do you?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了一段时间，我们终于到了河边，心中才高兴起来，知道自己走的路没有错。我们经过希普雷克的时候是十一点三刻，乔治慢吞吞地问道：“你还记得咱们住的那个小岛，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We imagined that we were inside our warm little boat, tired and a little hungry, with the dark, miserable river outside. We could see ourselves -- we were sitting down to supper there; we were passing cold meat and thick pieces of bread to each other. We could hear the happy sounds of our knives and our laughing voices. We hurried to make it real.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a dark and miserable night. It was quite cold, and it was raining a bit. We walked through the dark, silent fields, and we talked quietly to each other. We wondered if we were going the right way. We thought of our nice, warm, comfortable boat. We thought of Harris, and Montmorency, and the whisky -- and we wished that we were there.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was now becoming serious. It was after midnight. The hotels were all full, and we could not go round all the houses and knock on doors at midnight! George said that perhaps we could go back to Henley, find a policeman and hit him. He would arrest us and take us to a police station, and then we would have somewhere to sleep. But then we thought, 'Perhaps he won't arrest us. Perhaps he'll just hit us, too!'We could not fight policemen all night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，问题就严重了。时间已过半夜，旅馆也早已客满，我们总不能走遍全城，半夜里一家一家挨着敲门吧！乔治说也许我们应该回亨利城，找个警察，把他打一顿，他就会把我们抓起来带到派出所。那样我们就有地方睡觉了。可是转念一想：“说不定警察不抓我们，倒是也把我们揍一顿呢！”我们不能整个晚上都和警察打架。">查看中文翻译</div>

We began to wonder if there were only four islands, or if we were on the wrong bit of the river. Everything looked strange and different in the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们又摸索到第四个岛，同样毫无结果。雨下得越来越大，没有停的样子。我们又冷又湿，狼狈不堪。我们开始怀疑起来：到底是不是只有四个小岛呢？还是我们走到了另一个河岸？漆黑一片，一切都变幻莫测。">查看中文翻译</div>
