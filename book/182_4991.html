<div class="line_en">After this, Caspian and his Tutor had many more secret conversations on the top of the Great Tower, and at each conversation Caspian learned more about Old Narnia, so that thinking and dreaming about the old days, and longing that they might come back, filled nearly all his spare hours. But of course he had not many hours to spare, for now his education was beginning in earnest. He learned sword-fighting and riding, swimming and diving, how to shoot with the bow and play on the recorder and the theorbo, how to hunt the stag and cut him up when he was dead, besides Cosmography, Rhetoric, Heraldry, Versification, and of course History, with a little Law, Physic, Alchemy, and Astronomy. Of Magic he learned only the theory, for Doctor Cornelius said the practical part was not proper study for princes.</div>

<div class="line_en">After some years there came a time when the Queen seemed to be ill and there was a great deal of bustle and pother about her in the castle and doctors came and the courtiers whispered. This was in early summertime. And one night, while all this fuss was going on, Caspian was unexpectedly wakened by Doctor Cornelius after he had been only a few hours in bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">He also learned a great deal by using his own eyes and ears. As a little boy he had often wondered why he disliked his aunt, Queen Prunaprismia; he now saw that it was because she disliked him. He also began to see that Narnia was an unhappy country. The taxes were high and the laws were stern and Miraz was a cruel man.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went into the antechamber and there, sure enough, the two gentlemen-in-waiting were, sprawling on chairs and snoring hard. Doctor Cornelius quickly cut up the remains of a cold chicken and some slices of venison and put them, with bread and an apple or so and a little flask of good wine, into the wallet which he then gave to Caspian. It fitted on by a strap over Caspian's shoulder, like a satchel you would use for taking books to school.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wonder you have never asked me before," said the Doctor, "why, being the son of King Caspian, you are not King Caspian yourself. Everyone except your Majesty knows that Miraz is a usurper. When he first began to rule he did not even pretend to be the King: he called himself Lord Protector. But then your royal mother died, the good Queen and the only Telmarine who was ever kind to me. And then, one by one, all the great lords, who had known your father, died or disappeared. Not by accident, either. Miraz weeded them out. Belisar and Uvilas were shot with arrows on a hunting party: by chance, it was pretended. All the great house of the Passarids he sent to fight giants on the northern frontier till one by one they fell. Arlian and Erimon and a dozen more he executed for treason on a false charge. The two brothers of Beaversdam he shut up as madmen. And finally he persuaded the seven noble lords, who alone among all the Telmarines did not fear the sea, to sail away and look for new lands beyond the Eastern Ocean, and, as he intended, they never came back. And when there was no one left who could speak a word for you, then his flatterers (as he had instructed them) begged him to become King. And of course he did."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好像从来没有想过，”博士说，“为什么作为凯斯宾国王的儿子、法定的继承人，你却不是纳尼亚的国王。除了你以外，人人都知道弥若兹是个篡位夺权的小人。他开始统治的时候，并没有以国王的身分出现，他称自己是君王的保护人。后来，你的母后去世了。她是一位贤慧的王后，也是惟一一位待我仁慈的台尔马人。接着，所有那些刚正的大臣，那些对你父亲忠心耿耿的人，也一个个相继死去，或者失踪了，而且都死得很奇怪，没有一个是正常死亡。无疑是心狠手辣的弥若兹把他们都干掉了。比如，伯力沙和犹威拉思在一场捋猎中被箭射死了，说是失手误伤；他还把所有伯萨瑞德的望族都派到北边战场上，与巨人作战，直到他们一个个战死疆场；阿康和艾瑞蒙还有其他的十几个人，被他以莫须有的叛国罪处决了，海狸大坝的两兄弟也被他作为疯子关了起来。最后，他说服了台尔马人中惟独不怕大海的七位爵爷，航行到东海彼岸去寻找新大陆，正如他所希望的那样，他们一去便再也没有回来。终于，能够替你说话的人一个都不剩了，在他的指使下，那些阿谀奉承之辈便出面请求他做纳尼亚的国王。当然，他欣然接受了这请求。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't see!" exclaimed the Doctor. "Have all my lessons in History and Politics taught you no more than that? Listen. As long as he had no children of his own, he was willing enough that you should be King after he died. He may not have cared much about you, but he would rather you should have the throne than a stranger. Now that he has a son of his own he will want his own son to be the next King. You are in the way. He'll clear you out of the way."</div>

You must go alone and at once. Try to get across the southern border to the court of King Nain of Archenland. He will be good to you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That," said Doctor Cornelius, "is the greatest and most sacred treasure of Narnia. Many terrors I endured, many spells did I utter, to find it, when I was still young. It is the magic horn of Queen Susan herself which she left behind her when she vanished from Narnia at the end of the Golden Age. It is said that whoever blows it shall have strange help -- no one can say how strange. It may have the power to call Queen Lucy and King Edmund and Queen Susan and High King Peter back from the past, and they will set all to rights. It may be that it will call up Asian himself. Take it, King Caspian: but do not use it except at your greatest need. And now, haste, haste, haste. The little door at the very bottom of the Tower, the door into the garden, is unlocked. There we must part."</div>

Then came the fresh air in the garden, a fervent handclasp with the Doctor, a run across the lawn, a welcoming whinny from Destrier, and so King Caspian the Tenth left the castle of his fathers. Looking back, he saw fireworks going up to celebrate the birth of the new prince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一边走下那长长的旋转楼梯，克奈尔斯一边又轻声讲了许多指示和建议的话。凯斯宾心乱如麻，可是他努力把这些话全都记在心里。不久，他们呼吸到了花园里新鲜的空气，小道上传来戴思特里尔的蹄声和亲热的嘶叫声，老少两人终于依依不舍地告别。就这样，凯斯宾十世离开了他父亲的城堡。当他回过身来时，他看到天上升起无数的礼花，那是在庆祝新王子的诞生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All night he rode southward, choosing by-ways and bridle paths through woods as long as he was in country that he knew; but afterwards he kept to the high road. Destrier was as excited as his master at this unusual journey, and Caspian, though tears had come into his eyes at saying good-bye to Doctor Cornelius, felt brave and, in a way, happy, to think that he was King Caspian riding to seek adventures, with his sword on his left hip and Queen Susan's magic horn on his right. But when day came, with a sprinkle of rain, and he looked about him and saw on every side unknown woods, wild heaths, and blue mountains, he thought how large and strange the world was and felt frightened and small.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as it was full daylight he left the road and found an open grassy place amid a wood where he could rest. He took off Destrier's bridle and let him graze, ate some cold chicken and drank a little wine, and presently fell asleep. It was late afternoon when he awoke. He ate a morsel and continued his journey, still southward, by many unfrequented lanes. He was now in a land of hills, going up and down, but always more up than down. From every ridge he could see the mountains growing bigger and blacker ahead. As the evening closed in, he was riding their lower slopes. The wind rose. Soon rain fell in torrents. Destrier became uneasy; there was thunder in the air. And now they entered a dark and seemingly endless pine forest, and all the stories Caspian had ever heard of trees being unfriendly to Man crowded into his mind. He remembered that he was, after all, a Telmarine, one of the race who cut down trees wherever they could and were at war with all wild things; and though he himself might be unlike other Telmarines, the trees could not be expected to know this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天光大亮后，凯斯宾离开大路，在森林中找到一片草地，打算在这里好好休息一下。他卸下戴思特里尔身上的鞍子，让它在一旁吃草，自己则坐下来，吃些冷鸡，喝点儿酒，然后舒舒服服地躺在草地上，很快就进入了梦乡——他实在累极了。一觉醒来，天色已近黄昏，他草草吃了点儿东西，便又上路，依然是朝着南方。穿过大片荒芜的原野，不久便来到一片山地。这儿道路崎岖，时上时下，而且仿佛上山的路比下山的路要多。每登上一个山脊，他便注意到前面那些山峦显得越来越近，色调也越来越深。当夜幕降临时，他已经走在那座大山的山坡上了。突然，天上刮起了大风，接着便是雷声隆隆，暴雨如注。戴思特里尔变得焦躁不安起来。这时，他们走进一个漆黑一团、似乎没有尽头的松树林。凯斯宾一下子想起了他曾听过的那些故事。故事里的树林对人类总是很不友善。他的家族曾经到处砍伐树木，还和所有山林家族打仗，滥杀无辜。虽然他本人和那些台尔马人不同，可树木哪里知道这个？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nor did they. The wind became a tempest, the woods roared and creaked all round them. There came a crash. A tree fell right across the road just behind him. "Quiet, Destrier, quiet!" said Caspian, patting his horse's neck; but he was trembling himself and knew that he had escaped death by an inch. Lightning flashed and a great crack of thunder seemed to break the sky in two just overhead. Destrier bolted in good earnest. Caspian was a good rider, but he had not the strength to hold him back. He kept his seat, but he knew that his life hung by a thread during the wild career that followed. Tree after tree rose up before them in the dusk and was only just avoided.

<div class="line_en">"We ought to have killed it at once, or else let it alone," said a third voice. "We can't kill it now. Not after we've taken it in and bandaged its head and all. It would be murdering a guest."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="惊愕中一阵长时间的沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shall give it a drink," said the first voice, presumably Trufflehunter's. A dark shape approached the bed. Caspian felt an arm slipped gently under his shoulders -- if it was exactly an arm. The shape somehow seemed wrong. The face that bent towards him seemed wrong too. He got the impression that it was very hairy and very long nosed, and there were odd white patches on each side of it. "It's a mask of some sort," thought Caspian. "Or perhaps I'm in a fever and imagining it all." A cupful of something sweet and hot was set to his lips and he drank. At that moment one of the others poked the fire. A blaze sprang up and Caspian almost screamed with the shock as the sudden light revealed the face that was looking into his own. It was not a man's face but a badger's, though larger and friendlier and more intelligent than the face of any badger he had seen before. And it had certainly been talking. He saw, too, that he was on a bed of heather, in a cave. By the fire sat two little bearded men, so much wilder and shorter and hairier and thicker than Doctor Cornelius that he knew them at once for real Dwarfs, ancient Dwarfs with not a drop of human blood in their veins. And Caspian knew that he had found the Old Narnians at last. Then his head began to swim again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先给他喝点儿水。”又是第一个声音，也许是特鲁佛汉特。一个黑影朝床边走来，凯斯宾感到有一条胳膊轻轻渭到他的肩上——但愿这是一条人的胳膊，但不完全像。俯向他的那张脸似乎也不对劲，那是一张毛茸茸的脸，正中一只长长的鼻子，两颊上还有古怪的白斑。“这准是一种特殊的口罩，”凯斯宾思忖，“要不然就是我发烧产生的幻觉。”一杯又甜又热的东西放到他的嘴边，他一口气喝了下去。这时，篝火被拨得更旺了一些，凯斯宾几乎失声叫起来，因为他借着篝火的光亮，一下子看清了正对着他的那张脸。那不是一个人！那是一只獾。尽管它远比他以前见过的任何一只獾都大，却更加友善，也更加聪明。而且可以肯定，刚才一直在讲话的就是它。他还看出，自己是在一个山洞里，正躺在用石南草铺成的床上。在火堆旁边，坐着两个长着长胡须的小个子，他们比克奈尔斯博士更显得粗胖矮小，毛发也更浓密粗硬。他立即断定他们是小矮人——真正的纯种小矮人。凯斯宾意识到，他终于发现了古老的纳尼亚。激动之中，他又感到一阵眩晕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the next few days he learned to know them by names. The Badger was called Trufflehunter; he was the oldest and kindest of the three. The Dwarf who had wanted to kill Caspian was a sour Black Dwarf (that is, his hair and beard were black, and thick and hard like horsehair). His name was Nikabrik. The other Dwarf was a Red Dwarf with hair rather like a Fox's and he was called Trumpkin.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And now," said Nikabrik on the first evening when Caspian was well enough to sit up and talk, "we still have to decide what to do with this Human. You two think you've done it a great kindess by not letting me kill it. But I suppose the upshot is that we have to keep it a prisoner for life.
