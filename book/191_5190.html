<div class="line_en">The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁皮人正想回答，却听到一种低低的吼声，转过头去（他那些铰链是做得很精致的），看见一只奇异的野兽，跳过草地向他奔来。真的，是一只黄色的大野猫。铁皮人想道，它一定在追捕什么东西。因为它的一双耳朵，竖起了靠紧在头旁边，嘴大大地张开，露出两排可怕的牙齿，一双通红的眼睛，像火球样地发出红光来。当它 跑近来时，铁皮人看见跑在它前面的是一只灰色的小田鼠。虽然他没有心，但是他也知道，野猫想要杀死这样一只美丽无害的生物，这是不对的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁皮人举起斧头，正当这只野猫跑过时，向它很快地一劈，那只野兽的头，清清楚楚地离开了它的身体，四脚乱踢开去，分成两块。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't speak of it, I beg of you," replied the Woodman. "I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我请求你，不要这么说，”铁皮人回答说，“你要知道，我是没有心的，因此我格外留神去帮助那些需要帮助的朋友，即使只不过是帮助一只小老鼠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, indeed," said the Woodman, making a bow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，失敬了！”铁皮人说着鞠了一个躬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This funny tin man," she answered, "killed the Wildcat and saved my life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这一位好心的铁皮人，”它回答说，“杀了野猫，救了我的性命。所以将来你们必须为他服务，听从他的即使最微细的意志。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“所以你救了我的性命，不但做下了一件大事情，而且这是一件勇敢的事情。”田鼠皇后接着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed: "Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?"They all bowed so low to the little Queen that they almost stood upon their heads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这时候，好几只田鼠用尽它们小腿的力量跑过来，当它们瞧见了皇后，喊着：“啊，皇后，我们以为你被杀害了！你怎样能够从那只大野猫那里逃出来的！”它们一齐向小皇后低低地鞠躬，看上去差不多用头站在地面上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We will!" cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们知道了！”小田鼠们一齐用一种尖锐的合唱叫了出来。随后它们向各处逃开去，因为托托已经睡醒了，看见这些田鼠们还在它的四周，它发出一阵喜悦的吠声，跳进这一群的里头去。当托托住在堪萨斯州的时候，常常喜欢追赶老鼠们，它知道这事情不会有什么害处的。">查看中文翻译</div>

So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.</div>
