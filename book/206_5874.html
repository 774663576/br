<div class="line_en">"Jane, you look well and smiling and pretty," he said. "You will be Jane Rochester in four weeks' time, not a day more. I'll send for my family jewels, which are kept in a London bank. They are for my bride, whether she's a great lady or a governess."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就这个？真让我松了口气。好吧，我必须坦白，不过也许会惹你生气，就像昨晚上你跟我说我们是平等的那时候一样生气。我假装爱英格姆小姐，是为了让你嫉妒得发狂。我希望你能像我爱你一样地爱我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I would never have thought it!" she kept repeating. "Mr Rochester, so proud and such a gentleman! To marry his governess!" She examined me closely, as if to discover the reason for this strange event, and shook her head, still puzzled. "He's twenty years older than you! He could be your father!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我永远想不到！”她一直反复说着，“罗切斯特先生，这么骄傲，这么一位绅士！要娶他的家庭教师！”她仔细打量着我，似乎想为这件怪事找出点儿什么缘由。她摇着头，还是搞不懂。“他比你年长二十岁，可以当你父亲了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no, Miss Eyre, but you must realize that this is a very unusual situation. You must be careful of your reputation. I advise you to keep him at a distance until you are married."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，爱小姐，但你必须知道这种情况很不寻常，你得注意自己的名声。我建议你结婚之前和他保持距离。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, indeed, Mrs Fairfax," I replied crossly. "He looks much younger than that!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，费尔法斯太太。”我不悦地答道，“他看上去当然比这年轻。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why?" I asked. "Do you think he couldn't possibly love me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”我问。“你觉得他不可能爱上我？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although I was upset by the old lady's words, I followed her advice, and in the weeks before the wedding I went on teaching Adele as usual. Only in the evenings did I spend some time with Mr Rochester, and I was careful not to allow him to hold me in his arms or kiss me. Sometimes he was angry with me and called me a "hard little thing" or "a cruel spirit", but I preferred that to being called "my darling". I saw that Mrs Fairfax approved of my correct behaviour, and I knew that he respected me for it. But it was not easy for me. I would rather have shown him my love. My future husband was becoming my whole world, and more than that, my hope of heaven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管老太太的话让我不高兴，我还是听从了劝告，在婚礼前的几星期里继续照常给阿黛拉上课。只有晚上我才和罗切斯特先生待上一会儿，并小心翼翼地不让他搂抱或亲吻我。有时他生我的气，叫我“顽固的小东西”或者“残酷的精灵”，但我更愿听这个，而不愿听他叫我“我亲爱的”。我看出费尔法斯太太赞许我的正确举动，也知道他也因此而尊重我。但是，这对于我并非易事，我宁愿向他表露我的爱。我未来的丈夫已成了我世界的全部，还不止于此，他是我希望的天堂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the night before the wedding arrived. My clothes were packed and I was ready. But I was anxious to see Mr Rochester, who had been away on business, so I ran out of the quiet house to meet him on the road. A wild, stormy wind was blowing, and in the garden I passed the wreck of the great tree Then suddenly I saw him riding towards me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="婚礼的前夜终于来临，我的衣服都已收拾停当，我也做好了准备。但我很想见到罗切斯特先生，他因事外出了。于是我跑出静悄悄的屋子，到路上去迎候他。狂风呼啸着，我走过花园里倒地的大树，突然看到他策马向我奔来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see!" he shouted. "You can't do without me! Jump up onto my horse!" Together we rode back to Thornfield. While he ate dinner, I sat quietly beside him. He looked closely at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你瞧！”他喊道，“你不能没有我！快上马！”我们一起骑马回到特恩费得。他吃晚饭时，我就静静地坐在他身边。他端详着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," I replied firmly. "I'm not worried about that, because I love you. But last night I had a strange dream, a terrible dream! It was dark and windy outside, and before I went to sleep I could hear a dog growling in the distance. In my dream I was carrying a small child in my arms down a long road. I was trying to catch up with you, but I couldn't."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”我坚定地答道，“我不担心，因为我爱你。可是昨晚我做了一个奇怪的梦，一个可怕的梦！外面很黑，刮着风，临睡前我还听到远处的狗叫。梦中我抱着一个小孩走在一条漫漫长路上。我努力追赶着你，却追不上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It looked like a tall woman, with long thick dark hair hanging down she took up the beautiful veil you bought me, put it on her own head, then turned to admire herself in the mirror. It was then that I saw her wild, inhuman face! She removed the veil, tore it in two and threw it on the floor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那看上去像个高个子女人，浓浓的长发披垂下来。她拿起你给我买的漂亮的面纱，盖在自己头上，然后转身照着镜子欣赏。正是这时我才看到她那张狂野的、不像人长的脸！她取下面纱，将它撕成两半，扔到了地上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，等等。我的房间里有烛光，一个奇怪的人影仔细察看着我挂在衣柜里的婚纱。我的血都凝住了。那既不是费尔法斯太太，也不是哪个仆人，甚至连格丽丝·普尔都不是。那是一个可怕的景象！”">查看中文翻译</div>
