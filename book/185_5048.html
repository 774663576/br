<div class="line_en">"It was he who did all that, Sir," said Aravis. "Why, he rushed at a lion to save me."</div>

<div class="line_en">The next turn of the road- brought them out from among the trees and there, across green lawns, sheltered from the north wind by the high wooded ridge at its back, they saw the castle of Anvard. It was very old and built of a warm, reddish-brown stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道路再转一个弯，他们便出了树林；越过苍翠的连片草地，就望得见安瓦德的城堡了。城堡的背后是高高的、林木森森的山脊，给它挡住了北风。城堡很古老，用暖红棕色石头砌成。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before they had reached the gate King Lune came out to meet them, not looking at all like Aravis's idea of a king and wearing the oldest of old clothes; for he had just come from making a round of the kennels with his Huntsman and had only stopped for a moment to wash his doggy hands. But the bow with which he greeted Aravis as he took her hand would have been stately enough for an Emperor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们还没有走到城门口，国王伦恩就出来迎接他们了，看上去压根儿不像阿拉维斯心目中的国王，竟穿着旧衣服中最旧的衣服哩；因为他刚带着他的猎人们巡视他的养狗场回来，才歇一歇洗洗他那碰过狗儿的手。但他搀着阿拉维斯的手向她鞠躬致意时，其风度之庄严堂皇，就足以表明他是个皇帝了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Little lady," he said, "we bid you very heartily welcome. If my dear wife were still alive we could make you better cheer but could not do it with a better will. And I am sorry that you have had misfortunes and been driven from your father's house, which cannot but be a grief to you. My son Cor has told me about your adventures together and all your valour."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小姐，”他说，”我们由衷地欢迎你。如果我亲爱的妻子还健在，我们能让你更加兴高采烈，但现在是心有余而力不足了。我感到惋惜：你遭到了不幸，被令尊逐出家庭，这对你必然是件伤心事。我的儿子科奥跟我讲过你们一起经历的惊险事件和你的种种勇敢的行为。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Aravis told it. And Cor, who had very much wanted the story to be known, though he felt he couldn't tell it himself, didn't enjoy it so much as he had expected, and indeed felt rather foolish. But his father enjoyed it very much indeed and in the course of the next few weeks told it to so many people that Cor wished it had never happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是阿拉维斯便讲了这段故事。科奥原是很想让人知道这故事的，尽管他觉得不好意思由他自己讲出来；听她讲时，他却并不像原来期待的那样欣赏这件事了，倒觉得愚蠢可笑。可他的父亲确实十分欣赏，在接连几个星期里一直讲给许多人听，弄得科奥但愿这件事从来没有发生过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the King turned to Hwin and Bree and was just as polite to them as to Aravis, and asked them a lot of questions about their families and where they had lived in Narnia before they had been captured. The Horses were rather tongue-tied for they weren't yet used to being talked to as equals by Humans grown-up Humans, that is. They didn't mind Aravis and Cor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王随即转向赫温和布里，对待它们像对待阿拉维斯一样客气，问起它们许多问题：它们的家庭，被俘之前住在纳尼亚的什么地方。马儿们张口结舌，说不出话来，因为它们还不习惯于人们平等地跟它们说话——当然是指大人们。对阿拉维斯和科奥这样的孩子，它们倒不拘束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently Queen Lucy came out from the castle and joined them and King Lune said to Aravis, "My dear, here is a loving friend of our house, and she has been seeing that your apartments are put to rights for you better than I could have done it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜女王不久从城堡里出来，跟他们待在一起，国王伦恩对阿拉维斯说，”我亲爱的，我们家的一位可爱的朋友来了，她已经在关心你那居室的安排；由她经管，要比由我来办好得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy was sitting on the King's right and Aravis on his left. King Edmund sat at one end of the table and the Lord Darrin faced him at the other. Dar and Peridan and Cor and Corin were on the same side as the King.</div>

We have still that sorry creature Rabadash on our hands, my friends, and must needs resolve what to do with him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在阳台上吃午饭（冷盘杂鸟、冷盘野味馅饼、酒、面包、干酪），饭后，国王伦恩皱皱眉头，叹了一口气，说道：”嗨！我的朋友们，我们手里还有个丑角拉巴达什，必须决定如何处理他才好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You'd like to come and see them, wouldn't you?" said Lucy, kissing Aravis.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你愿意来看看吗？”露茜亲吻阿拉维斯，说道。她们立刻互相喜欢起对方来了，不久就一同走开去，谈起阿拉维斯的寝室和梳妆室，谈起要给阿拉维斯穿的衣服，以及姑娘们在这种场合总要谈起的诸如此类的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A fig for the Tisroc," said King Lune. "His strength is in numbers and numbers will never cross the desert. But I have no stomach for killing men (even traitors) in cold blood.

<div class="line_cn" title="“蒂斯罗克算什么，”国王伦恩说道，”他的力量在于人多势众，而人多就永远穿越不了大沙漠。但我没有冷酷地杀人的心肠，哪怕他是个奸细。在战场上砍断他的喉管我倒十分心安理得：但这是截然不同的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rabadash was brought before them in chains. To look at him anyone would have supposed that he had passed the night in a noisome dungeon without food or water; but in reality he had been shut up in quite a comfortable room and provided with an excellent supper. But as he was sulking far too furiously to touch the supper and had spent the whole night stamping and roaring and cursing, he naturally did not now look his best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴着铁链的拉巴达什给带了上来。瞧瞧他的模样，任何人都会猜想他是在一个喧闹的地牢里过了一夜，既没有食物，又没有水喝；事实上他却是给关在一个十分舒服的房间里，供他吃的伙食也十分精美。但因为他生气得非常厉害，晚饭一点也不肯吃，又整夜顿足、吼叫、咒骂，现在看上去自然不是他最好的模样儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Rabadash rolled his eyes and spread out his mouth into a horrible, long mirthless grin like a shark, and wagged his ears up and down (anyone can learn how to do this if they take the trouble). He had always found this very effective in Calormen. The bravest had trembled when he made these faces, and ordinary people had fallen to the floor, and sensitive people had often fainted. But what Rabadash hadn't realized is that it is very easy to frighten people who know you can have them boiled alive the moment you give the word. The grimaces didn't look at all alarming in Archenland; indeed Lucy only thought Rabadash was going to be sick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉巴达什这时转动眼珠，张开嘴巴，像鲨鱼似的发出可怕而沉闷的露齿狞笑，上下摆动着耳朵（如果肯费工夫，任何人都能学会的）。从前在卡乐门他这一套总是很奏效的。他做这鬼脸时，最勇敢的人发抖，普普通通的人倒在地上，神经过敏的人往往昏厥过去。然而拉巴达什不曾认识到的事实是：老百姓知道，你只要下个命令便可立刻把他们活活煮死，要吓唬他们自然是容易的。在阿钦兰，扮鬼脸看来压根儿不惊人；事实上，露茜只觉得拉巴达什大概快要生病了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They couldn't help it. Rabadash had been wagging his ears all the time and as soon as Aslan said, "The hour has struck!" the ears began to change. They grew longer and more pointed and soon were covered with grey hair. And while everyone was wondering where they had seen ears like that before, Rabadash's face began to change too. It grew longer, and thicker at the top and larger eyed, and the nose sank back into the face (or else the face swelled out and became all nose) and there was hair all over it. And his arms grew longer and came down in front of him till his hands were resting on the ground: only they weren't hands, now, they were hoofs. And he was standing on all fours, and his clothes disappeared, and everyone laughed louder and louder (because they couldn't help it) for now what had been Rabadash was, simply and unmistakably, a donkey. The terrible thing was that his human speech lasted just a moment longer than his human shape, so that when he realized the change that was coming over him, he screamed out:</div>

<div class="line_en">And here, to get him out of the way, I'd better finish off the story of Rabadash. He (or it) was duly sent back by boat to Tashbaan and brought into the temple of Tash at the great Autumn Festival, and then he became a man again. But of course four or five thousand people had seen the transformation and the affair could not possibly be hushed up. And after the old Tisroc's death when Rabadash became Tisroc in his place he turned out the most peaceable Tisroc Calormen had ever known. This was because, not daring to go more than ten miles from Tashbaan, he could never go on a war himself: and he didn't want his Tarkaans to win fame in the wars at his expense, for that is the way Tisrocs get overthrown. But though his reasons were selfish, it made things much more comfortable for all the smaller countries round Calormen. His own people never forgot that he had been a donkey. During his reign, and to his face, he was called Rabadash the Peacemaker, but after his death and behind his back he was called Rabadash the Ridiculous, and if you look him up in a good History of Calormen (try the local library) you will find him under that name. And to this day in Calormene schools, if you do anything unusually stupid, you are very likely to be called "a second Rabadash".</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile at Anvard everyone was very glad that he had been disposed of before the real fun began, which was a grand feast held that evening on the lawn before the castle, with dozens of lanterns to help the moonlight. And the wine flowed and tales were told and jokes were cracked, and then silence was made and the King's poet with two fiddlers stepped out into the middle of the circle. Aravis and Cor prepared themselves to be bored, for the only poetry they knew was the Calormene kind, and you know now what that was like. But at the very first scrape of the fiddles a rocket seemed to go up inside their heads, and the poet sang the great old lay of Fair Olvin and how he fought the Giant Pire and turned him into stone (and that is the origin of Mount Pire -- it was a two-headed Giant) and won the Lady Liln for his bride; and when it was over they wished it was going to begin again. And though Bree couldn't sing he told the story of the fight at Zalindreh. And Lucy told again (they had all, except Aravis and Cor, heard it many times but they all wanted it again) the tale of the Wardrobe and how she and King Edmund and Queen Susan and Peter the High King had first come into Narnia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在此期间，在安瓦德城里人人都十分高兴，拉巴达什已经遣送回去了，城里真正的赏心乐事便开始了。那是个盛大的宴会，当天晚上在城堡前的草坪上举行，张着几十盏灯，灯光同月光互相映辉。酒像水一样流淌。人们讲着故事，说着笑话，然后是一片寂静，国王的诗人带着两个提琴手走进人们围成的圈子中央。阿拉维斯和科奥原是准备忍受沉闷无聊的，因为他们懂得的诗篇不过是卡乐门的那种诗歌，而现在才知道诗歌是什么玩艺儿了。但提琴刚演奏开头的曲调，就仿佛有个火箭飞进了他们的头脑里，诗人唱着伟大的古老歌谣，关于漂亮的奥尔文的歌谣，关于他怎样和巨人皮尔作战，把巨人变成了石头（这就是皮尔峰的来历——一个生着两个脑袋的巨人），并且赢得莉尔恩小姐做他的新娘。歌谣唱完时，他们真希望诗人重新再唱一遍。布里虽然不会唱，却讲了扎林德雷之战的故事。露茜又讲了大衣柜以及她和国王爱德蒙、女王苏珊以及至尊王彼得最初进入纳尼亚的故事。除开阿拉维斯和科奥，他们大家都听她讲过好几遍了，但他们都想再听一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It would be nice to end the story by saying that after that the two brothers never disagreed about anything again, but I am afraid it would not be true. In reality they quarrelled and fought just about as often as any other two boys would, and all their fights ended (if they didn't begin) with Cor getting knocked down. For though, when they had both grown up and become swordsmen, Cor was the more dangerous man in battle, neither he nor anyone else in the North Countries could ever equal Corin as a boxer. That was how he got his name of Corin Thunder-Fist; and how he performed his great exploit against the Lapsed Bear of Stormness, which was really a Talking Bear but had gone back to Wild Bear habits. Corm climbed up to its lair on the Narnian side of Stormness one winter day when the snow was on the hills and boxed it without a time-keeper for thirty-three rounds. And at the end it couldn't see out of its eyes and became a reformed character.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="故事结束时最好交代一下：从此以后，两兄弟之间就永远再也没有什么意见分歧了；但我担心这样讲是不确实的。事实上他们俩时常吵架打架，就像任何两个孩子一样，而他俩的打架（如果真的打起来了），结果总是科奥被打倒在地。他们俩长大成人时，都成了武士，虽然科奥在战斗中是更加凶猛的，然而，作为拳击手，科奥也好，北方各国里的任何英雄好汉也好，都不能同科林媲美。他便是如此这般获得了”霹雳拳击手科林”的美名的，便是如此这般压倒了暴风雨峰”堕落的熊”，建立了巨大功勋的。它原来确实是头会说人话的熊，后来却倒退到野熊的习性和习惯中去了。在山中积雪的一个冬日里，科林攀登暴风雨峰纳尼亚一侧，走到熊窝那儿，计时器也不带，挥拳猛击那熊三十三个回合。打到后来，那熊眼睛发黑，看也没法儿看了，是那熊又被改变过来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I'm afraid, even fights) with Cor, but they always made it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up, they were so used to quarrelling and making it up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently. And after King Lune's death they made a good King and Queen of Archenland and Ram the Great, the most famous of all the kings of Archenland, was their son. Bree and Hwin lived happily to a great age in Narnia and both got married but not to one another.
