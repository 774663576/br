<div class="line_en">America was where all my mother's hopes lay. She had come here in 1949 after losing everything in China: her mother and father, her family home, her first husband, and two daughters, twin baby girls. But she never looked back with regret. There were so many ways for things to get better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈将一切未遂的心愿、希望，都寄托在美国这片土地上。她是在1949年来到美国的。在中国，她丧失了一切：双亲，家园，她的前夫和一对孪生女儿。但她对过去的一切，从不用悲恸的目光去回顾，眼前，她有太多的打算，以便将生活安排得更好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We didn't immediately pick the right kind of prodigy. At first my mother thought I could be a Chinese Shirley Temple. We'd watch Shirley's old movies on TV as though they were training films. My mother would poke my arm and say, "Ni kan"-- You watch. And I would see Shirley tapping her feet, or singing a sailor song, or pursing her lips into a very round O while saying, "Oh my goodness."</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after my mother got this idea about Shirley Temple, she took me to a beauty training school in the Mission district and put me in the hands of a student who could barely hold the scissors without shaking. Instead of getting big fat curls, I emerged with an uneven mass of crinkly black fuzz. My mother dragged me off to the bathroom and tried to wet down my hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="立时，妈有了培养目标了。她把我带去我们附近一家美容培训班开办的理发店，把我交到一个学员手里。这个学生，甚至连剪刀都拿不像，经她一番折腾，我的头发，成了一堆稀浓不均的鬈曲的乱草堆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The instructor of the beauty training school had to lop off these soggy clumps to make my hair even again. "Peter Pan is very popular these days," the instructor assured my mother. I now had hair the length of a boy's, with straight-across bangs that hung at a slant two inches above my eyebrows. I liked the haircut and it made me actually look forward to my future fame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="美容培训班的指导老师不得不亲自出马，再操起剪刀来修理我头上那湿漉漉的一团。“彼得·潘的式样，近日是非常时行的。”那位指导老师向妈吹嘘着。我的头发，已剪成个男孩子样，前面留着浓密的、直至眉毛的刘海。我挺喜欢这次理发，它令我确信，我将前途无量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In fact, in the beginning, I was just as excited as my mother, maybe even more so. I pictured this prodigy part of me as many different images, trying each one on for size. I was a dainty ballerina girl standing by the curtains, waiting to hear the right music that would send me floating on my tiptoes. I was like the Christ child lifted out of the straw manger, crying with holy indignity. I was Cinderella stepping from her pumpkin carriage with sparkly cartoon music filling the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every night after dinner, my mother and I would sit at the Formica kitchen table. She would present new tests, taking her examples from stories of amazing children she had read in Ripley's Believe It or Not, or Good Housekeeping, Reader's Digest, and a dozen other magazines she kept in a pile in our bathroom. My mother got these magazines from people whose houses she cleaned. And since she cleaned many houses each week, we had a great assortment. She would look through them all, searching for stories about remarkable children.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two or three months had gone by without any mention of my being a prodigy again. And then one day my mother was watching The Ed Sullivan Show on TV. The TV was old and the sound kept shorting out. Every time my mother got halfway up from the sofa to adjust the set, the sound would go back on and Ed would be talking. As soon as she sat down, Ed would go silent again. She got up, the TV broke into loud piano music. She sat down. Silence. Up and down, back and forth, quiet and loud. It was like a stiff embraceless dance between her and the TV set. Finally she stood by the set with her hand on the sound dial.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两三个月安然无事地过去了，其间，再没提一个有关“天才”的字眼了。一天，妈在看电视，那是艾德·索利凡的专题节目，一个小女孩正在表演钢琴独奏。这是台很旧的电视机，发出的声音时响时轻，有时甚至还会停顿。每每它哑巴的时候，妈就要起身去调整它，待她还没走到电视机前，电视机又讲话了，于是就像故意要作弄她一番似的，反正她一离沙发，电视就出声了，她一坐下，艾德就变哑巴。最后，妈索性守在电视机边，将手按在键盘上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So now on nights when my mother presented her tests, I performed listlessly, my head propped on one arm. I pretended to be bored. And I was. I got so bored I started counting the bellows of the foghorns out on the bay while my mother drilled me in other areas. The sound was comforting and reminded me of the cow jumping over the moon. And the next day, I played a game with myself, seeing if my mother would give up on me before eight bellows. After a while I usually counted only one, maybe two bellows at most. At last she was beginning to give up hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以后来，每当妈再要我做什么测试时，我便做出一副无精打采的样子，将手肘撑在桌上，头懒懒地倚在上面，装出一副心不在焉的样子。事实上，我也实在无法专心。当妈又开始她的测试课时，我便开始专心倾听迷雾茫茫的海湾处的浪涛声，那沉闷的声响，颇似一条在气喘吁吁奔跑的母牛。几次下来，妈放弃了对我的测试。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then I saw what seemed to be the prodigy side of me -- because I had never seen that face before. I looked at my reflection, blinking so I could see more clearly. The girl staring back at me was angry, powerful. This girl and I were the same. I had new thoughts, willful thoughts, or rather thoughts filled with lots of won'ts. I won't let her change me, I promised myself. I won't be what I'm not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，忽然我似乎这才发现了真正的天才的自己，镜中的女孩，闪眨着聪明强硬的目光看着我，一个新的念头从我心里升起：我就是我，我不愿让她来任意改变我。我向自己起誓，我要永远保持原来的我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="电视里的琴声似令她着迷了，只见演奏者既有力，又柔和地敲着琴键，突地，一阵密切铿锵的琶音倾泻而下，犹如决堤的洪水，翻江倒海地奔腾起来，只见她手腕一抬，那激动急骤的旋律顿时烟消云散了，那含有诗意、温存的音符，从她手指尖下飘逸出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could see why my mother was fascinated by the music. It was being pounded out by a little Chinese girl, about nine years old, with a Peter Pan haircut. The girl had the sauciness of a Shirley Temple. She was proudly modest like a proper Chinese child.

<div class="line_cn" title="我们的课程是这样进行的。他先打开琴谱，指着各种不同的标记，向我解释着它们各自代表的意义：“这是高音谱号！低音谱号！没有升号和降号的，就是C调。喏，跟着我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would play after him, the simple scale, the simple chord, and then I just played some nonsense that sounded like a cat running up and down on top of garbage cans. Old Chong smiled and applauded and then said, "Very good! But now you must learn to keep time!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我就跟着他，先是简单的音阶和和弦，接着，就有点胡闹了，只是些杂乱的噪声，那声音，活像一只猫在垃圾洞顶上窜蹦不停。老钟却大声叫好：“好！非常好，但要学会掌握弹奏的速度。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So that's how I discovered that Old Chong's eyes were too slow to keep up with the wrong notes I was playing. He went through the motions in half-time. To help me keep rhythm, he stood behind me, pushing down on my right shoulder for every beat. He balanced pennies on top of my wrists so I would keep them still as I slowly played scales and arpeggios. He had me curve my hand around an apple and keep that shape when playing chords.

<div class="line_en">So maybe I never really gave myself a fair chance. I did pick up the basics pretty quickly, and I might have become a good pianist at that young age. But I was so determined not to try, not to be anybody different that I learned to play only the most ear-splitting preludes, the most discordant hymns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许，我确实没有好好地下过功夫，否则，我想我极有可能在这方面有所作为的；或许我真的会成为一个少年钢琴家。就我这样学钢琴，也很快地掌握了基本的要领和技巧。可我实在太执拗，那么顽固地拒绝与众不同，所以我只学会弹震耳欲聋的前奏曲和最最不和谐的赞美诗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He taught me all these things, and that was how I also learned I could be lazy and get away with mistakes, lots of mistakes.

<div class="line_cn" title="在他教会我这一整套技巧时，我也学会了如何偷懒，并掩盖自己的失误。如果我按错了一个琴键，我从来不去纠正，只是坦然地接着往下弹。而老钟，则自顾往下指挥着他自己的无声的音乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the next year, I practiced like this, dutifully in my own way. And then one day I heard my mother and her friend Lindo Jong both talking in a loud bragging tone of voice so others could hear. It was after church, and I was leaning against the brick wall wearing a dress with stiff white petticoats. Auntie Lindo's daughter, Waverly, who was about my age, was standing farther down the wall about five feet away. We had grown up together and shared all the closeness of two sisters squabbling over crayons and dolls. In other words, for the most part, we hated each other. I thought she was snotty. Waverly Jong had gained a certain amount of fame as "Chinatown's Littlest Chinese Chess Champion."</div>

But I dawdled over it, playing a few bars and then cheating, looking up to see what notes followed. I never really listened to what I was playing. I daydreamed about being somewhere else, about being someone else.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I stood up, I discovered my legs were shaking. Maybe I had just been nervous and the audience, like Old Chong, had seen me go through the right motions and had not heard anything wrong at all. I swept my right foot out, went down on my knee, looked up and smiled. The room was quiet, except for Old Chong, who was beaming and shouting, "Bravo! Bravo! Well done!" But then I saw my mother's face, her stricken face. The audience clapped weakly, and as I walked back to my chair, with my whole face quivering as I tried not to cry, I heard a little boy whisper loudly to his mother, "That was awful," and the mother whispered back, "Well, she certainly tried."</div>

A chill started at the top of my head and began to trickle down. Yet I couldn't stop playing, as though my hands were bewitched. I kept thinking my fingers would adjust themselves back, like a train switching to the right track. I played this strange jumble through two repeats, the sour notes staying with me all the way to the end.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你就是不肯试一下。”妈继续说着，既不生气，也不懊丧，那口气，似只是在讲述一件永远无法得到核准的事实。“拿去吧！”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I didn't at first. It was enough that she had offered it to me. And after that, every time I saw it in my parents' living room, standing in front of the bay windows, it made me feel proud, as if it were a shiny trophy I had won back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，起先我并没马上把琴拉走。它依旧静静地置在妈妈家起居室里，那个回窗框前。打这以后每次看到它，总使我有一种自豪感，好像它是我曾经赢得的一个荣誉的奖品。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Last week I sent a tuner over to my parents' apartment and had the piano reconditioned, for purely sentimental reasons. My mother had died a few months before and I had been getting things in order for my father, a little bit at a time. I put the jewelry in special silk pouches. The sweaters she had knitted in yellow, pink, bright orange -- all the colors I hated -- I put those in moth-proof boxes. I found some old Chinese silk dresses, the kind with little slits up the sides. I rubbed the old silk against my skin, then wrapped them in tissue and decided to take them home with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上星期，我请了个调音师到我父母公寓去，那纯粹是出于一种感情寄托。数月前，妈去世了。爸交给我一些她的遗物，我每去一次，便带回去一点。我把首饰放在一只缎锦荷包里，还有，她自己编织的毛衣：有黄的、粉红的、橘黄的——恰恰都是我最不喜欢的颜色。我一一把它们置放在防蛀的箱子里。我还发现几件旧的绸旗袍，那种边上镶滚条两边开高叉的。我把它们挨到脸颊上轻轻摩挲着，心中有一阵温暖的触动，然后用软纸把它们小心包起来带回家去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After I had the piano tuned, I opened the lid and touched the keys. It sounded even richer than I remembered. Really, it was a very good piano. Inside the bench were the same exercise notes with handwritten scales, the same secondhand music books with their covers held together with yellow tape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钢琴调校好，那音色比我记忆中的，还要圆润清丽，这实在是一架上乘的钢琴。琴凳里，我的练习记录本和手写的音阶还在。一本封皮已脱落的旧琴谱，被小心地用黄缎带扎捆着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I opened up the Schumann book to the dark little piece I had played at the recital. It was on the left-hand side of the page, "Pleading Child." It looked more difficult than I remembered. I played a few bars, surprised at how easily the notes came back to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我将琴谱翻到舒曼的那曲《请愿的孩童》，就是那次联谊会上让我丢丑的。它似比我记忆中更有难度。我摸索着琴键弹了几小节，很惊讶自己竟这么快就记起了乐谱，应付自如。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And for the first time, or so it seemed, I noticed the piece on the right-hand side. It was called "Perfectly Contented." I tried to play this one as well. It had a lighter melody but the same flowing rhythm and turned out to be quite easy. "Pleading Child" was shorter but slower; "Perfectly Contented" was longer, but faster. And after I played them both a few times, I realized they were two halves of the same song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="似是第一次，我刚刚发现这首曲子的右边，是一曲《臻美》，它的旋律更活泼轻快，但风格和《请愿的孩童》很相近，这首曲子里，美好的意境得到更广阔无垠的展现，充满慰藉与信心，流畅谐美，很容易弹上手。《请愿的孩童》比它要短一点，但节奏要缓慢一点。《臻美》要长一点，节奏轻快一点。在我分别将这两首曲子弹了多次后，忽然悟出，这两首曲子，其实是出于同一主题的两个变奏。">查看中文翻译</div>
