<div class="line_en">Does school prepare children for the real world? "Study hard and get good grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits," my parents used to say. Their goal in life was to provide a college education for my older sister and me, so that we would have the greatest chance for success in life. When I finally earned my diploma in 1976 -- graduating with honors, and near the top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University -- my parents had realized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In accordance with the "Master Plan," I was hired by a "Big 8" accounting firm, and I looked forward to a long career and retirement at an early age.</div>

<div class="line_en">My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hard-working families, of modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also graduated with honors, but he did it twice: first as an engineer and then from law school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious Washington, D. C., law firm that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed bright, career path well-defined and early retirement guaranteed.</div>

If I follow your advice, I'll wind up like you, working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security anymore; I know all about downsizing and rightsizing.

Many of today's youth have credit cards before they leave high school, yet they have never had a course in money or how to invest it, let alone understand how compound interest works on credit cards. Simply put, without financial literacy and the knowledge of how money works, they are not prepared to face the world that awaits them, a world in which spending is emphasized over savings.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just What I Was Looking For My husband, Mike, was so impressed with CASHFLOW, the new educational product that Robert Kiyosaki was developing, that he arranged for both of us to participate in a test of the prototype.

<div class="line_en">Mike was right. It was the educational product I had been looking for. But it had a twist: It looked like a colorful Monopoly board with a giant well-dressed rat in the middle. Unlike Monopoly, however, there were two tracks: one inside and one outside. The object of the game was to get out of the inside track -- what Robert called the "Rat Race" and reach the outer track, or the "Fast Track." As Robert put it, the Fast Track simulates how rich people play in real life. Robert then defined the "Rat Race" for us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔是对的，这正是我在寻找的东西。它看上去就像一个“强手”或者“大富翁”一类的游戏，中间画着一只打扮入时的大老鼠。但它并不像那些游戏那样简单，游戏板上有两条路：一条在内部，一条在外部。游戏的目标是走出内部的路——罗伯特把它称作“老鼠赛跑”，进人到外面的路上，或叫“快车道”，并最终以投资获得的收益实现自己的“人生梦想”。正如罗伯特所设计的，快车道就如同“强手”或“大富翁”一类的游戏那样充分地显示了富人在生活中是怎么干的，然而当大多数的玩者在生活中还没有真正成为富人以前，这些游戏除了增加人们不切实际的财富梦想和纯粹的娱乐以外，似乎并不能对人们的经济生活有任何帮助和指导。然而当罗伯特接着向我们解释“老鼠赛跑”的含义时，我立刻被深深地吸引住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

The proud parents are excited because the child excels, gets fair to good grades, and is accepted into a college. The child graduates, maybe goes on to graduate school and then does exactly as programmed: looks for a safe, secure job or career.

They feel successful, their future is bright, and they decide to buy a house, a car, a television, take vacations and have children. The happy bundle arrives. The demand for cash is enormous. The happy couple decides that their careers are vitally important and begin to work harder, seeking promotions and raises. The raises come, and so does another child and the need for a bigger house. They work harder, become better employees, even more dedicated. They go back to school to get more specialized skills so they can earn more money. Maybe they take a second job. Their incomes go up, but so does the tax bracket they're in and the real estate taxes on their new large home, and their Social Security taxes, and all the other taxes. They get their large paycheck and wonder where all the money went. They buy some mutual funds and buy groceries with their credit card.
