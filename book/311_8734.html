<div class="line_en">When Eleanor walked into the living room, Park had just gotten out of the shower, which was embarrassing for some reason. His hair was wet and his T-shirt was kind of sticking to him. He was really happy to see her. That was obvious. (And nice.)</div>

<div class="line_en">Park peeled off the paper carefully and looked at the book. It was The Catcher in the Rye. A really old edition.

He ran his fingertips along the chain and settled the pendant on her throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other day at lunch, Tina had a made big point of walking by Eleanor's table and mouthing the C-word. The c-u-n-t word. (Richie didn't even use that word, which implied an unimaginable degree of filth.)</div>

<div class="line_en">The only safe time to take a bath in her house was right after school. If Eleanor went over to Park's house right after school, she had to hope that Richie would still be at the Broken Rail when she got home that night. And then she had to take a really fast bath because the back door was right across from the bathroom, and it could open at any time.</div>
