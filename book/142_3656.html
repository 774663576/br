<div class="line_en">The Don was a real man at the age of twelve. Short, dark, slender, living in the strange Moorish-looking village of Corleone in Sicily, he had been born Vito Andolini, but when strange men came to kill the son of the man they had murdered, his mother sent the young boy to America to stay with friends. And in the new land he changed his name to Corleone to preserve some tie with his native village. It was one of the few gestures of sentiment he was ever to make.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Sicily at the turn of the century the Mafia was the second government, far more powerful than the official one in Rome. Vito Corleone's father became involved in a feud with another villager who took his case to the Mafia. The father refused to knuckle under and in a public quarrel killed the local Mafia chief. A week later he himself was found dead, his body torn apart by lupara blasts. A month after the funeral Mafia gunmen came inquiring after the young boy, Vito. They had decided that he was too close to manhood, that he might try, to avenge the death of his father in the years to come. The twelve-year-old Vito was hidden by relatives and shipped to America. There he was boarded with the Abbandandos, whose son Genco was later to become Consigliere to his Don.</div>

<div class="line_en">Young Vito went to work in the Abbandando grocery store on Ninth Avenue in New York's Hell's Kitchen. At the age of eighteen Vito married an Italian girl freshly arrived from Sicily, a girl of only sixteen but a skilled cook, a good housewife. They settled down in a tenement on Tenth Avenue, near 35th Street, only a few blocks from where Vito worked, and two years later were blessed with their first child, Santino, called by all his friends Sonny because of his devotion to his father.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the neighborhood lived a man called Fanucci. He was a heavy-set, fierce-looking Italian who wore expensive light-colored suits and a cream-colored fedora. This man was reputed to be of the "Black Hand," an offshoot of the Mafia which extorted money from families and storekeepers by threat of physical violence. However, since most of the inhabitants of the neighborhood were violent themselves, Fanucci's threats of bodily harm were effective only with elderly couples without male children to defend them. Some of the storekeepers paid him trifling sums as a matter of convenience. However, Fanucci was also a scavenger on fellow criminals, people who illegally sold Italian lottery or ran gambling games in their homes. The Abbandando grocery gave him a small tribute, this despite the protests of young Genco, who told his father he would settle the Fanucci hash. His father forbade him. Vito Corleone observed all this without feeling in any way involved.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day Fanucci was set upon by three young men who cut his throat from ear to ear, not deeply enough to kill him, but enough to frighten him and make him bleed a great deal. Vito saw Fanucci fleeing from his punishers, the circular slash flowing red. What he never forgot was Fanucci holding the cream-colored fedora under his chin to catch the dripping blood as he ran. As if he did not want his suit soiled or did not want to leave a shameful trail of carmine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，法怒其遭到了一伙年轻人的突然袭击，他们在他的咽喉处划了一道很长的口子，从左耳下面一直划到了右耳下面，虽然划得不够深，还没有达到致命处，但却足以把他吓一跳，也使他流了许多血。维托亲眼看到法怒其为了摆脱那三个想惩罚他的人而竭力逃命，那道半圆形的长口子在流着血。他从来没有忘记法怒其逃命时的那副狼狈相，手捧着那顶奶油色的浅顶软呢帽，端在下巴底下，一面跑，一面用帽子接着流下来的血。好像他是不愿意让自己的衣服给血弄脏，或者不愿意在地上留下可耻的血迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But this attack proved a blessing in disguise for Fanucci. The three young men were not murderers, merely tough young boys determined to teach him a lesson and stop him from scavenging. Fannucci proved himself a murderer. A few weeks later the knife-wielder was shot to death and the families of the other two young men paid an indemnity to Fanucci to make him forswear his vengeance. After that the tributes became higher and Fanucci became a partner in the neighborhood gambling games. As for Vito Corleone, it was none of his affair. He forgot about it immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这次袭击对法怒其来说，也真是侥幸。原来那三个年轻人并不是真的想杀他，他们只不过是几个性格倔强的小伙子而已，本来只想教训他一下，使他不再敲诈勒索。而法怒其自己却证明自己是个谋杀犯。几星期后，那个拿刀子的青年就被击毙了，另外两个青年的家属给法怒其付了一笔补偿金，要求他发誓不再报仇。这一下，贡款越来越多了，法怒其也就成了主办街道赌场的一个合伙人。说到维托·考利昂，这一切都不关他的事，他很快也就把这件事忘记了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young Vito, however, felt a cold anger for the dreaded Fanucci. He never showed this anger in any way but bided his time. He worked in the railroad for a few months and then, when the war ended, work became slow and he could earn only a few days' pay a month. Also, most of the foremen were Irish and American and abused the workmen in the foulest language, which Vito always bore stone-faced as if he did not comprehend, though he understood English very well despite his accent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是从另一方面讲，年轻的维托对令人望而生畏的法怒其却从心底产生了一股无法遏制的愤怒。他从来没有以任何方式流露过这种愤怒，但是他一直在等待着时机。他在铁路上干了几个月。不久，战争就结束了，工程进度缓慢下来，他一个月只能挣几天的钱。还有，大多数工头都是爱尔兰人和美国人，经常用不堪入耳的臭话来辱骂工人。维托一直忍着，面不改色，好像他听不懂似的，其实尽管他口音不纯，听力还是很好的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During World War I, when imported olive oil became scarce, Fanucci acquired a part-interest in the Abbandando grocery store by supplying it not only with oil, but imported Italian salami, hams and cheeses. He then moved a nephew into the store and Vito Corleone found himself out of a job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在第一次世界大战期间，当进口的橄榄油缺乏的时候，法怒其不但向阿班旦杜食品杂货店供应橄榄油，而且还供应进口的意大利香肠、火腿和乳酪，因而获得了店里的部分股权。接着他就把自己的一个侄子安插在店里，维托·考利昂稀里糊涂地失了业。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By this time, the second child, Frederioo, had arrived and Vito Corleone had four mouths to feed. Up to this time he had been a quiet, very contained young man who kept his thoughts to himself. The son of the grocery store owner, young Genco Abbandando, was his closest friend, and to the surprise of both of them, Vito reproached his friend for his father's deed. Genco, flushed with shame, vowed to Vito that he would not have to worry about food. That he, Genco, would steal food from the grocery to supply his friend's needs. This offer though was sternly refused by Vito as too shameful, a son stealing from his father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，第二个孩子弗烈德里科已经生下来，维托·考利昂有四张嘴巴向他要饭吃。直到这时，他一直是个沉默寡言的非常能忍的年轻人，有什么想法总是压在心里。食品杂货店老板的儿子、年轻的劲科·阿班旦杜是他最亲密的朋友，维托因为他朋友的父亲的行为而责怪起他的朋友来了，这一点维托自己和他的朋友都感到诧异。劲科羞红了脸，对维托发誓说：维托不必为吃的发愁，他还说，他打算从食品店里偷东西来保证他的朋友的需要。不过，这种毛遂自荐遭到了维托的断然拒绝，因为太可耻了，当儿子的竟然偷起他的爸爸来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Clemenza's face was strained and urgent. He was in some sort of trouble and Vito's helping action was instinctive. But when he untied the bundle in his kitchen, there were five oily guns staining the white cloth. He put them in his bedroom closet and waited. He learned that Clemenza had been taken away by the police. They must have been knocking on his door when he handed the guns over the air shaft.</div>

Vito took some parcels of food from his friend Genco while he thought things out. Finally he was approached by Clemenza and Tessio, another young tough of the neighborhood. They were men who thought well of him, the way he carried himself, and they knew he was desperate. They proposed to him that he become one of their gang which specialized in hijacking trucks of silk dresses after those trucks were loaded up at the factory on 31st Street. There was no risk. The truck drivers were sensible workingmen who at the sight of a gun flopped on the sidewalk like angels while the hijackers drove the truck away to be unloaded at a friend's warehouse. Some of the merchandise would be sold to an Italian wholesaler, part of the loot would be sold door-to-door in the Italian neighborhoods -- Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, Mulberry Street, and the Chelsea district in Manhattan -- all to poor Italian families looking for a bargain, whose daughters could never be able to afford such fine apparel. Clemenza and Tessio needed Vito to drive since they knew he chauffeured the Abbandando grocery store delivery truck. In 1919, skilled automobile drivers were at a premium.</div>

He was also impressed with the coolness of Clemenza and Tessio. They didn't get excited but joked with the driver, told him if he was a good lad they'd send his wife a few dresses. Because Vito thought it stupid to peddle dresses himself and so gave his whole share of stock to the fence, he made only seven hundred dollars. But this was a considerable sum of money in 1919.</div>

Indeed he thought, at that moment, that Fanucci was a crazy fool. From what he had seen of Clemenza, that burly Sicilian would sooner give up his life than a penny of his loot.

He recalled everything he knew about Fanucci. He remembered the day the man had had his throat cut and had run down the street holding his fedora under his chin to catch the dripping blood. He remembered the murder of the man who had wield the knife and the other two having their sentences removed by paying an indemnity. And suddenly he was sure that Fanucci had no great connections, could not possibly have. Not a man who informed to the police. Not a man who allowed his vengeance to be bought off. A real Mafioso chief would have had the other two men killed also. No. Fanucci had got lucky and killed one man but had known he could not kill the other two after they were alerted. And so he had allowed himself to be paid. It was the personal brutal force of the man that allowed him to levy tribute on the shopkeepers, the gambling games that ran in the tenement apartments.

He saw Fanucci turn the corner toward 11th Avenue and knew he was headed toward his apartment, probably to put away his loot before coming out on the streets again. Perhaps to put away his gun. Vito Corleone left his apartment and ran up the stairs to the roof. He traveled over the square block of roofs and descended down the steps of an empty loft building fire escape that left him in the back yard. He kicked the back door open and went through the front door. Across the street was Fanucci's tenement apartment house.</div>

<div class="line_en">He watched through the glass door of the vestibule, knowing Fanucci would come down from Tenth Avenue. Clemenza had showed him the safety on the gun and he had triggered it empty. But as a young boy in Sicily at the early age of nine, he had often gone hunting with'his father, had often fired the heavy shotgun called the lupara. It was his skill with the lupara even as a small boy that had brought the sentence of death upon him by his father's murderers.</div>

<div class="line_en">The village of tenements extended only as far west as Tenth Avenue. Eleventh Avenue was mostly warehouses and lofts rented by firms who shipped by New York Central Railroad and wanted access to the freight yards that honeycombed the area from Eleventh Avenue to the Hudson River. Fanucci's apartment house was one of the few left standing in this wilderness and was occupied mostly by bachelor trainmen, yard workers, and the cheapest prostitutes. These people did not sit in the street and gossip like honest Italians, they sat in beer taverns guzzling their pay. So Vito Corleone found it an easy matter to slip across the deserted Eleventh Avenue and into the vestibule of Fanucci's apartment house. There he drew the gun he had never fired and waited for Fanucci.</div>

Vito stepped back, shoulders pressed against the inner door that led to the stairs. He held his gun out to fire. His extended hand was only two paces from the outside door. The door swung in. Fanucci, white, broad, smelly, filled the square of light. Vito Corleone fired.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿，他躲在门厅暗处，看到法怒其白色的身影跨过马路，向大门走来。维托往后退了几步，肩膀紧紧靠着通向楼梯的门，他端起枪，准备开火。他那只拿枪的手伸出去，离外面的门只有两步远。门朝里一转，开了。法怒其，身上白白的，宽宽的，散发着臭气，出现在从门里透进来的方形亮光里，维托·考利昂放枪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fanucci fell to his knees, propping the door open. He let out a terrible groan, the groan of a man in great physical distress that was almost comical. He kept giving these groans; Vito remembered hearing at least three of them before he put the gun against Fanucci's sweaty, suety cheek and fired into his brain. No more than five seconds had passed when Fanucci slumped into death, jamming the door open with his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法怒其腿一弯，跪了下去，把门撑开了。他发出了可怕的一声“啊”，维托把枪抵着法怒其那冷汗横流的板油似的脸颊，稍稍朝上对准脑壳开了一枪，不到五秒钟，法怒其颓然倒下去，死了，他的身子把开着的门堵住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The opened door let some of the sound escape into the street, the rest of the gun's explosion shook the building. Fanucci was holding on to the sides of the door, trying to stand erect, trying to reach for his gun. The force of his struggle had torn the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose. His gun was exposed but so was a spidery vein of red on the white shirtfront of his stomach. Very carefully, as if he were plunging a needle into a vein, Vito Corleone fired his second bullet into that red web.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="枪声通过开着的门传到了大街上，枪声把楼房震得抖动莱起来。法怒其抓住门边，拼命想站直，伸手掏自己的枪。他挣扎时用力过猛，把上衣的钮扣都挣脱了，上衣敞开了，他的枪亮了出来，但是他衬衣前襟上蜘蛛网似的血迹也淌出来了。维托·考利昂非常注意，仿佛是要把针插进血管似的，对准网状血迹，打了第二颗子弹。">查看中文翻译</div>

The barrel wouldn't break. He reversed it in his hand and smashed the butt against the side of a chimney. The butt split into two halves. He smashed it again and the pistol broke into barrel and handle, two separate pieces. He used a separate air shaft for each.

He only learned later that the police had been delighted with the murder of Fanucci and not too anxious to pursue his killers.

Soon he had the enormous income for that time and place of one hundred dollars a week. Since Clemenza and Tessio were his friends, his allies, he had to give them each part of the money, but this he did without being asked. Finally he decided to go into the olive oil, importing business with his boyhood chum, Genco Abbandundo. Genco would handle the business, the importing of the olive oil from Italy, the buying at the proper price, the storing in his father's warehouse. Genco had the experience for this part of the business. Clemenza and Tessio would be the salesmen. They would go to every Italian grocery store in Manhattan, then Brooklyn, then the Bronx, to persuade store owners to stock Genco Pura olive oil. (With typical modesty, Vito Corleone refused to name the brand after himself.) Vito of course would be the head of the firm since he was supplying most of the capital.

He was a devoted father and husband but so busy he could spare his family little of his time. As Genco Pura olive oil grew to become the bestselling imported Italian oil in America, his organization mushroomed. Like any good salesman he came to understand the benefits of undercutting his rivals in price, barring them from distribution outlets by persuading store owners to stock less of their brands. Like any good businessman he aimed at holding a monopoly by forcing his rivals to abandon the field or by merging with his own company. However, since he had started off relatively helpless, economically, since he did not believe in advertising, relying on word of mouth and since if truth be told, his olive oil was no better than his competitors', he could not use the common strangleholds of legitimate businessmen. He had to rely on the force of his own personality and his reputation as a "man of respect."</div>

<div class="line_en">Even as a young man, Vito Corleone became known as a "man of reasonableness." He never uttered a threat. He always used logic that proved to be irresistible. He always made certain that the other fellow got his share of profit. Nobody lost. He did this, of course, by obvious means. Like many businessmen of genius he learned that free competition was wasteful, monopoly efficient. And so he simply set about achieving that efficient monopoly. There were some oil wholesalers is Brooklyn, men of fiery temper, headstrong, not amenable to reason, who refused to see, to recognize, the vision of Vito Corleone, even after he had explained everything to them with the utmost patience and detail. With these men Vito Corleone threw up his hands is despair and sent Tessio to Brooklyn to set up a headquarters and solve the problem. Warehouses were burned, truckloads of olive-green oil were dumped to form lakes in the cobbled waterfront streets. One rash man, an arrogant Milanese with more faith in the police than a saint has in Christ, actually went to the authorities with a complaint against his fellow Italians, breaking the ten-century-old law, of omerta. But before the matter could progress any further the wholesaler disappeared, never to be seen again, leaving behind, deserted, his devoted wife and three children, who, God be thanked, were fully grown and capable of taking over his business and coming to terms with the Genco Pura oil company.</div>

<div class="line_en">But great men are not born great, they grow great, and so it was with Vito Corleone. When prohibition came to pass and alcohol forbidden to be sold, Vito Corleone made the final step from a quite ordinary, somewhat ruthless businessman to a great Don in the world of criminal enterprise. It did not happen in a day, it did not happen in a year, but by the end of the Prohibition period and the start of the Great Depression, Vito Corleone had become the Godfather, the Don, Don Corleone.</div>

<div class="line_en">It started casually enough. By this time the Genco Pura Oil Company had a fleet of six delivery trucks. Through Clemenza, Vito Corleone was approached by a group of Italian bootleggers who smuggled alcohol and whiskey in from Canada. They needed trucks and deliverymen to distribute their produce over New York City. They needed deliverymen who were reliable, discreet and of a certain determination and force. They were willing to pay Vito Corleone for his trucks and for his men. The fee was so enormous that Vito Corleone cut back drastically on his oil business to use the trucks almost exclusively for the service of the bootlegger-smugglers. This despite the fact that these gentlemen had accompanied their offer with a silky threat. But even then Vito Carleone was so mature a man that he did not take insult at a threat or become angry and refuse a profitable offer because of it. He evaluated the threat, found it lacking in conviction, and lowered his opinion of his new partners because they had been so stupid to use threats where none were needed. This was useful information to be pondered at its proper time.</div>

Meanwhile, since it was inevitable that some of his trucks be stopped by the police, Genco Abbandando hired a fine lawyer with many contacts in the Police Department and the judiciary. A system of payoffs was set up and soon the Corleone organization had a sizable "sheet," the list of officials entitled to a monthly sum.

The whole thing was becoming unwieldy. Finally Vito Corleone worked out a system of organization. He gave Clemenza and Tessio each the title of Caporegime, or captain, and the men who worked beneath them the rank of soldier. He named Genco Abbandando his counselor, or Consigliere. He put layers of insulation between himself and any operational act. When he gave an order it was to Genco or to one of the caporegimes alone. Rarely did he have a witness to any order he gave any particular one of them. Then he split Tessio's group and made it responsible for Brooklyn. He also split Tessio off from Clemenza and made it clear over the years that he did not want the two men to associate even socially except when absolutely necessary. He explained this to the more intelligent Tessio, who caught his drift immediately, though Vito explained it as a security measure against the law. Tessio understood that Vito did not want his two caporegimes to have any opportunity to conspire against him and he also understood there was no ill will involved, merely a tactical precaution. In return Vito gave Tessio a free hand in Brooklyn while he kept Clemenza's Bronx life very much under his thumb. Clemenza was the braver, more reckless, the crueler man despite his outward jollity, and needed a tighter rein.</div>

But the men of Don Corleone walked the streets with their heads held high, their pockets stuffed with silver and paper money. With no fear of losing their jobs. And even Don Corleone, that mgt modest of men, could not help feeling a sense of pride. He was taking care of his world, his people. He had not failed those who depended on him and gave him the sweat of their brows, risked their freedom and their lives in his service. And when an employee of his was arrested and sent to prison by some mischance, that unfortunate man's family received a living allowance; and not a miserly, beggarly, begrudging pittance but the same amount the man earned when free.</div>

<div class="line_en">This of course was not pure Christian charity. Not his best friends would have called Don Corleone a saint from heaven. There was some self-interest in this generosity. An employee sent to prison knew he had only to keep his mouth shut and his wife and children would be cared for. He knew that if he did not inform to the police a warm welcome would be his when he left prison. There would be a party waiting in his home, the best of food, homemade ravioli, wine, pastries, with all his friends and relatives gathered to rejoice in his freedom. And sometime during the night the Consigliere, Genco Abbandando, or perhaps even the Don himself, would drop by to pay his respects to such a stalwart, take a glass of wine in his honor, and leave a handsome present of money so that he could enjoy a week or two of leisure with his family before returning to his daily toil. Such was the infinite sympathy and understanding of Don Corleone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Vito Corleone helped them all. Not only that, he helped them with goodwill, with encouraging words to take the bitter sting out of the charity he gave them. It was only natural then that when these Italians were puzzled and confused on who to vote for to represent them in the state legislature, in the city offices, in the Congress, they should ask the advice of their friend Don Corleone, their Godfather. And so he became a political power to be consulted by practical party chiefs. He consolidated this power with a far-seeing statesmanlike intelligence; by helping brilliant boys from poor Italian families through college, boys who would later become lawyers, assistant district attorneys, and even judges. He planned for the future of his empire with all the foresight of a great national leader.</div>

<div class="line_en">The repeal of Prohibition dealt this empire a crippling blow but again he had taken his precautions. In 1933 he sent emissaries to the man who controlled all the gambling activities of Manhattan, the crap games on the docks, the shylocking that went with it as hot dogs go with baseball games, the bookmaking on sports and horses, the illicit gambling houses that ran poker games, the policy or numbers racket of Harlem. This man's name was Salvatore Maranzano and he was one of the acknowledged pezzonovante,.90 calibers, or big shots of the New York underworld. The Corleone emissaries proposed to Maranzano an equal partnership beneficial to both parties. Vito Corleone with his organization, his police and political contacts, could give the Maranzano operations a stout umbrella and the new strength to expand into Brooklyn and the Bronx. But Maranzano was a short-sighted man and spurned the Corleone offer with contempt. The great Al Capone was Maranzano's friend and he had his own organization, his own men, plus a huge war chest. He would not brook this upstart whose reputation was more that of a Parliamentary debater than a true Mafioso. Maranzano's refusal touched off the great war of 1933 which was to change the whole structure of the underworld in New York City.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="令老头子感到非常扫兴的是，他的保镖喊他回去。那三个工人都是又高又大的粗壮小伙子，围着锅炉。他们把上面的零件已经拆下来了，摆得地下室的水泥地上到处都是。他们的组长是个爱指手画脚的人，粗声粗气地对老头子说：“你这个锅炉出毛病了。如果你要我们把锅炉修好，把零件都装配上去，那你得付一百五十美元的工钱和零件费；我们也就认为你的锅炉经过检查是合格的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The leader of the three men shrugged. "We just leave the furnace the way it is now." He gestured at the metal parts strewn over the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not simply a joke; he was considering making his son his underboss. This was one of the tests a business executive had to pass.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonny's solution did not altogether please his father. It was too direct, too lacking in Sicilian subtleness. He was the Club, not the Rapier. For as soon as Sonny heard the leader's demand he held the three men at gunpoint and had them thoroughly bastinadoed by the bodyguards. Then he made them put the furnace together again and tidy up the basement. He searched them and found that they actually were employed by a house-improvement firm with headquarters in Suffolk County. He learned the name of the man who owned the firm. Then he kicked the three men to their truck. "Don't let me see you in Long Beach again," he told them. "I'll have your balls hanging from your ears."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿的处理并没有使他父亲完全满意。方式也太直来直去了，大缺乏西西里式的微妙手腕了。他用的是大棒，而不是软而锋利的轻剑。桑儿一听那个组长的要求，马上就叫几个保镖把枪口对准那三个人，用棍子痛打他们的脚底。然后，又强迫他们把锅炉重新安装好，还把地下室打扫干净。他搜了他们的身，发现他们实际上受雇于一家总部设在萨福克县的住宅设备改良公司，他们也了解到了这个公司的老板的名字。然后，他脚踢拳打地把那三个人送上了他们的卡车。“下次让我在长滩镇再看到你们的话，”他警告他们，“我要把你们的睾丸割下来挂在你们的耳朵上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he went out into the garden and said to Sonny, "Listen, there's some men working on the furnace, I don't understand what they want. Go in and take care of the matter."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was typical of the young Santino, before he became older and crueler, that he extended his protection to the community he lived in. Sonny paid a personal call to the home-improvement firm owner and told him not to send any of his men into the Long Beach area ever again. As soon as the Corleone Family set up their usual business liaison with the local police force they were informed of all such complaints and all crimes by professional criminals. In less than a year Long Beach became the most crime-free town of its size in the United States. Professional stickup artists and strong-arms received one warning not to ply their trade in the town. They were allowed one offense. When they committed a second they simply disappeared. The flimflam home-improvement gyp artists, the door-to-door con men were politely warned that they were not welcome in Long Beach. Those confident con men who disregarded the warning were beaten within an inch of their lives. Resident young punks who had no respect for law and proper authority were advised in the most fatherly fashion to run away from home. Long Beach became a model city.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是桑迪诺的典型作风，后来他变得更冷酷、更无情了，把他的保护范围扩大到了他所居住的那一地区的全体居民。桑儿亲自访问了那个家用设备改良公司的老板，告诉他别再派任何人到长滩镇。考利昂家族同当地警察部队建立了经常性业务联系之后，他们就知道了所有这类控诉以及职业犯罪分子的罪行。在不到一年，长滩镇就成了美国同样规模城镇中犯罪活动最少的城镇，各种死心塌地的犯罪分子和巧取豪夺的职业诈骗分子受到了同样的警告，别在长滩镇招摇撞骗。第一次初犯，可以受到宽免；二次重犯，他们马上就会从人间消失。那些胡言乱语的打着家用设备改良招牌的骗子，那些走家串户的诈骗犯，也都受到了很有礼貌的警告：他们在长滩镇是不受欢迎的，如果某些有恃无恐的诈骗犯对警告置若罔闻，就会给打得几乎丧命。住在当地的无视法律和权威的小流氓受到了严父般的忠告：离开家乡，到别处去流浪。这样，长滩镇就变成了模范城镇。">查看中文翻译</div>
