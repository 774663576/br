<div class="line_en">Charlotte started skipping toward the stage. Julian ran after her, and then turned around halfway down the aisle.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come on!" he said loudly, waving for me to follow him, which I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快过来啊！”他大声喊，挥手叫我跟上他，我跟了上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charlotte basically didn't stop talking as we headed down to the second floor. She was describing the play they had put on last year, which was Oliver! She played Oliver even though she's a girl. As she said this, she pushed open the double doors to a huge auditorium. At the other end of the room was a stage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下到二楼的过程中，夏洛特基本上说个不停。她说着去年上演的一出戏——《雾都孤儿》！虽然她是个女孩，但是她演奥利弗。正说着，她推开了大礼堂的两扇门。礼堂的另一端是舞台。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There were like hundreds of people in the audience that night," said Charlotte, and it took me a second to realize she was still talking about Oliver! "I was so, so nervous. I had so many lines, and I had all these songs to sing. It was so, so, so, so hard!" Although she was talking to me, she really didn't look at me much. "On opening night, my parents were all the way in back of the auditorium, like where Jack is right now, but when the lights are off, you can't really see that far back. So I was like, 'Where are my parents? Where are my parents?' And then Mr. Resnick, our theater-arts teacher last year -- he said: 'Charlotte, stop being such a diva!' And I was like, 'Okay!' And then I spotted my parents and I was totally fine. I didn't forget a single line."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那天晚上观众席上好像有几百人。”夏洛特说，我愣了一会儿才反应过来，她竟然还在谈论《雾都孤儿》！“我实在太紧张了，紧张死了。我台词那么多，而且还有那么多歌曲要唱。实在是太难太难了！”虽然她是在跟我说话，但她其实没怎么看我。“在首演的那个晚上，我父母一直都在大礼堂的后台，大概就在杰克现在的位置，可是当灯光熄灭的时候，你不可能看得到那么远。于是我一直想，‘我的爸爸妈妈在哪里？我的爸爸妈妈去哪儿了？’就在那时，雷斯尼克先生——我们去年的戏剧表演老师——说话了：‘夏洛特，不要变成这样的女主角！’我说，‘好的！’然后我看见了父母，就完全好了。我一句台词都没忘。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We put on a play every year," said Charlotte.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们每年都要演一出戏。”夏洛特说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While she was talking, I noticed Julian staring at me out of the corner of his eye. This is something I see people do a lot with me. They think I don't know they're staring, but I can tell from the way their heads are tilted. I turned around to see where Jack had gone to. He had stayed in the back of the auditorium, like he was bored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在她喋喋不休的时候，我注意到朱利安一直在拿眼角瞟我。这种事情我已经见惯不惊。他们以为我不知道他们在盯着我看，但我能从他们脑袋偏斜的角度感觉得到。我转过身去看杰克去哪里了。原来他一直待在礼堂的后台，一副很无聊的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think he's going to want to be in the school play, Charlotte," said Julian sarcastically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不觉得他会想在学校话剧里演出，夏洛特。”朱利安挖苦地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yeah, whoopee," said Julian, twirling his finger in the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的，哇！”朱利安在空中打了个响指说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But you don't have to take the theater-arts elective if you don't want to," Charlotte said, shrugging. "There's dance or chorus or band. There's leadership."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，如果你不愿意，你不一定非选修戏剧表演不可，”夏洛特耸耸肩说，“还有舞蹈，合唱团和管乐队。也有领导力课程。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only dorks take leadership," Julian interrupted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有呆瓜才会选修领导力课程。”朱利安插嘴道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can be in the play without actually being 'in' the play," Charlotte answered, looking at me. "You can do the lighting. You can paint the backdrops."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可以参与话剧，但实际上不一定在话剧里演出，”夏洛特看着我回答，“你可以担任灯光师，你还可以画幕布。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Julian, you're being so obnoxious!" said Charlotte, which made Julian laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朱利安，你实在是太讨厌了！”夏洛特叫道，这逗得朱利安哈哈大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm taking the science elective," I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah." I nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”我点头道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was homeschooled, Julian!" said Charlotte.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他在家上学，朱利安！”夏洛特说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So teachers came to his house?" asked Julian, looking puzzled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么是老师去他家上课？”朱利安一脸困惑地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Julian looked directly at me. "The science elective is supposably the hardest elective of all," he said. "No offense, but if you've never, ever been in a school before, why do you think you're suddenly going to be smart enough to take the science elective? I mean, have you ever even studied science before? Like real science, not like the kind you do in kits?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朱利安直视着我。“科学巩怕是所有选修课中最难的，”他说，“我没有冒犯的意思，但是如果你以前从来没有上过学，你为什么觉得自己突然聪明到可以选修科学课了呢？我的意思是，你以前学习过科学吗？像真正的科学，而不是你在工具箱里玩的那种玩意儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is she a teacher?" Julian said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是老师吗？”朱利安问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你妈妈是老师吗？”夏洛特问我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So she's not a real teacher!" said Julian, as if that proved his point. "That's what I mean. How can someone who's not a real teacher actually teach science?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么她不是一个真正的老师！”朱利安说，好像他的观点不证自明，“我就是这个意思，一个不是真正科学老师的人怎么能真正教科学呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I shrugged again. Didn't he just ask me a question?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又耸耸肩。他不是才问了一个问题吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not rude questions like that," said Charlotte. "Besides, he was born like that. That's what Mr. Tushman said. You just weren't listening."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可不是问这么无礼的问题，”夏洛特说，“而且，他生来就是这样，图什曼先生已经说过了。你就是不听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Geez, Julian," said Jack. "Just shut up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天啊，朱利安，”杰克说，“闭嘴！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Can I ask you a question?" he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以问你一个问题吗？”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I walked toward Jack and followed him out of the auditorium. He held the double doors open for me, and as I passed by, he looked at me right in the face, kind of daring me to look back at him, which I did. Then I actually smiled. I don't know. Sometimes when I have the feeling like I'm almost crying, it can turn into an almost-laughing feeling. And that must have been the feeling I was having then, because I smiled, almost like I was going to giggle. The thing is, because of the way my face is, people who don't know me very well don't always get that I'm smiling. My mouth doesn't go up at the corners the way other people's mouths do. It just goes straight across my face. But somehow Jack Will got that I had smiled at him. And he smiled back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我朝杰克走过去，跟着他出了大礼堂。他替我拉开门，我走过去的时候，他正好看着我的脸，一副生怕我回看他的表情——而我恰恰这么做了。实际上我还笑了。我不知道。有时候当我感觉快哭出来的时候，往往会演变成一种几乎想笑的冲动。那一定是我当时的真实感受，因为我笑了，几乎咯咯咯地笑了。问题是，因为我的脸是这个样子，不了解我的人不会认为我在笑。我的嘴不会像别人那样咧到嘴角，而是整张脸都被扭曲了。不过杰克·威尔明白我在朝他笑。他也朝我笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You shut up!" Julian yelled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你才闭嘴！”朱利安嚷道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's the deal with your face? I mean, were you in a fire or something?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的脸是怎么回事？我的意思是，是被火烧的还是出了什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was so listening!" said Julian. "I just thought maybe he was in a fire, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我听了！”朱利安说，“我只是认为他也有可能被火烧过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Julian, that's so rude!" said Charlotte.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah you did," Charlotte nodded. "You said the science elective is supposably really hard. I heard you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，你有，”夏洛特点头道，“你说，科学选修课‘巩怕’很难。我听到你说了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I absolutely did not," he insisted.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对了，那个词应该是‘恐怕’。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, let's just go," agreed Charlotte, following Jack down the stairs to the next floor. I started to follow her, but Julian cut right in front of me, which actually made me stumble backward.</div>

I nodded as Julian and Charlotte caught up to us. We were all quiet for a second, all of us just kind of nodding, looking at the floor. Then I looked up at Julian.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朱利安是个混蛋，”在朱利安和夏洛特赶上我们之前，他低声对我说，“不过，老兄，你要多说话。”他说这句话的时候很严肃，像在尽力安慰我。在朱利安和夏洛特朝我们走过来的时候，我点了点头。我们都沉默了一会儿，所有人都微微点了下头，看着地板。然后我抬头看着朱利安。">查看中文翻译</div>
