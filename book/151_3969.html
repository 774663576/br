<div class="line_en">"Hey, August." It was Charlotte, giving me her little wave as she sat down at a desk in the front of the class. Why anyone would ever choose to sit way up front in a class, I don't know.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went inside the classroom, and the teacher was writing on the chalkboard while all the kids started sitting at different desks. The desks were in a half circle facing the chalkboard, so I chose the desk in the middle toward the back, which I thought would make it harder for anyone to stare at me. I still kept my head way down, just looking up enough from under my bangs to see everyone's feet. As the desks started to fill up, I did notice that no one sat down next to me. A couple of times someone was about to sit next to me, then changed his or her mind at the last minute and sat somewhere else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走进教室，老师正在黑板上写字，所有的同学开始各就其位。课桌面向黑板呈半圆形散布开来，于是我选了中间靠后的位置，我觉得这样大家盯着我看会比较困难。我依然低着脑袋，视线足以从刘海下面看到每一个人的脚。课桌慢慢坐满了，我注意到没人挨着我坐下来。好几次有人正要在我旁边坐下，却在最后一刻改变了主意，坐到别的地方去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went straight to room 301 on the third floor. Now I was glad I'd gone on that little tour, because I knew exactly where to go and didn't have to look up once. I noticed that some kids were definitely staring at me now. I did my thing of pretending not to notice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我径自朝三楼301教室走去。我很高兴自己经历了那次小小的参观活动，因为我现在目标明确，根本用不着抬头。这时，我注意到有一些同学在直直地盯着我看。我只管走路，假装没看到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey," I said, nodding hello. Then I noticed Julian was sitting a few seats away from her, talking to some other kids. I know he saw me, but he didn't say hello.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨！”我点头向她问好。这时我注意到朱利安只与她隔了几个座位，正在跟几个孩子聊天。我知道他看见我了，但他没有打招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay, kids, okay, everybody! Settle down," said the teacher, now facing us. She had written her name, Ms. Petosa, on the chalkboard. "Everybody find a seat, please. Come in," she said to a couple of kids who had just walked in the room. "There's a seat there, and right there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，孩子们，好了，诸位！请安静！”老师面朝我们说。她在黑板上写下了自己的名字：皮特莎小姐。“每个人都找个座位坐下来。请进，”她对刚走进教室的几个孩子说，“那边有个座位，就在那儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly someone was sitting down next to me. It was Jack Will. Jack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，有人在我旁边坐了下来。是杰克·威尔。杰克。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"… put your backpacks down and quiet down."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What's up," he said, nodding at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好。”他冲我点点头说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她只犹豫了百万分之一秒，但是她看到我的那一瞬间我还是捕捉到了。就像我说的：如今我已经习惯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm going to take attendance and do the seating chart," she continued, sitting on the edge of her desk. Next to her were three neat rows of accordion folders. "When I call your name, come up and I'll hand you a folder with your name on it. It contains your class schedule and your combination lock, which you should not try to open until I tell you to. Your locker number is written on the class schedule. Be forewarned that some lockers are not right outside this class but down the hall, and before anyone even thinks of asking: no, you cannot switch lockers and you can't switch locks. Then if there's time at the end of this period, we're all going to get to know each other a little better, okay? Okay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我现在点名，然后排定座位表。”她在讲台边坐下来继续说。在她身边整整齐齐地摆放着三堆折叠文件夹。“我叫到谁的名字，谁就过来，我会发写有你们名字的文件。里面有你们的课程表和密码锁，没有我的吩咐你们不能打开。你们的锁号写在课程表上。事先要说明的是，有一些储物柜不在教室外面，而是在楼下大厅里。我把话说在前面：是的，你们不能换储物柜，也不能换锁。如果最后还有时间，大家就来互相认识一下，好吗？好吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She picked up the clipboard on her desk and started reading the names out loud.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，那么，朱利安·奥尔本斯？”她抬起头叫道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hi, Julian," she said, making a note on her seating chart. She picked up the very first folder and held it out toward him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，朱利安。”她说着在座位表上做了个记号。她拿起第一份文件夹，递向他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come pick it up," she said, kind of no-nonsense. He got up and took it from her. "Ximena Chin?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“过来拿。”她有点严肃地说。他站起来，从她手里接了过去。“西蒙娜·陈？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She handed a folder to each kid as she read off the names. As she went down the list, I noticed that the seat next to me was the only one still empty, even though there were two kids sitting at one desk just a few seats away. When she called the name of one of them, a big kid named Henry Joplin who already looked like a teenager, she said: "Henry, there's an empty desk right over there. Why don't you take that seat, okay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她念到一个名字，就发出一个文件夹。随着她念下去，我注意到只有我旁边的座位是空的，可是隔了几个座位，有两个孩子挤在同一张课桌上。她点了其中一个人的名字，一个叫亨利·乔普林的俨然已经是个青少年的大男孩，她说：“亨利，那边有张空桌子，你去坐那个位置，好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Julian raised his hand and said "Here" at the same time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朱利安举起手，说了一声“到”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She handed him his folder and pointed to the desk next to mine. Although I didn't look at him directly, I could tell Henry did not want to move next to me, just by the way he dragged his backpack on the floor as he came over, like he was moving in slow motion. Then he plopped his backpack up really high on the right side of the desk so it was kind of like a wall between his desk and mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把文件夹递给他，然后指着我旁边的课桌。虽然我没有直接看他，但是从他在地板上拖着背包慢吞吞挪过来的方式，我感觉他不愿意坐过来。他扑通一声把背包往桌子右边一放，于是他和我之间就像竖了一堵高墙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="皮特莎小姐点完了剩下的几个名字。最后一个是杰克·威尔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"August Pullman?" said Ms. Petosa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奥古斯特·普尔曼？”皮特莎小姐叫道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hi, August," she said, smiling at me very nicely when I went up to get my folder. I kind of felt everyone's eyes burning into my back for the few seconds I stood in the front of the class, and everybody looked down when I walked back to my desk. I resisted spinning the combination when I sat down, even though everyone else was doing it, because she had specifically told us not to. I was already pretty good at opening locks, anyway, because I've used them on my bike. Henry kept trying to open his lock but couldn't do it. He was getting frustrated and kind of cursing under his breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，奥古斯特。”我走到她跟前接过文件夹时，她亲切地笑着对我说。我站在教室前面，有那么一会儿，我感觉每个人的眼光几乎都在灼灼地燃烧我的后背。当我走回座位时，每个人却都低下了头。我坐下来，忍住没去动密码锁，虽然她特别交代我们不要打开，但大家都在这样做。无论如何，我开锁已经很熟练了，因为我的自行车用的就是这种锁。亨利一直在试图开锁，但总是徒劳。他变得有些沮丧，低声诅咒着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After she handed Jack his folder, she said: "Okay, so, everybody write your combinations down somewhere safe that you won't forget, okay? But if you do forget, which happens at least three point two times per semester, Mrs. Garcia has a list of all the combination numbers. Now go ahead, take your locks out of your folders and spend a couple of minutes practicing how to open them, though I know some of you went ahead and did that anyway." She was looking at Henry when she said that. "And in the meanwhile, I'll tell you guys a little something about myself. And then you guys can tell me a little about yourselves and we'll, um, get to know each other. Sound good? Good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把文件夹发给杰克后说：“好了，每个人都把自己的密码记下来，别忘了，好吗？不过，如果你们忘了——每学期至少会发生三点二次——加西亚太太那里有一张所有锁的密码单。现在动手吧，把锁从文件夹里取出来，用几分钟时间练习一下怎么打开，虽然我知道有一些人已经迫不及待地先打开了。”她说这话的时候一直盯着亨利。“同时，我也要跟你们介绍我自己，接下来大家可以告诉我一些你们的情况，这样我们，嗯，就可以互相了解。听起来不错吧？很好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here," I said quietly, raising my hand a bit.</div>

<div class="line_en">Henry still couldn't get his lock to open, and he was getting more and more frustrated every time someone else popped one open. He got really annoyed when I was able to open mine on the first try. The funny thing is, if he hadn't put the backpack between us, I most definitely would have offered to help him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亨利屡试屡败，其他人每打开一把，他就多一分沮丧。看到我一下子就打开了，他简直气急败坏。有意思的是，如果他没有把背包横在我们中间的话，我一定会主动帮他的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned around and started writing on the chalkboard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她转过身，开始在黑板上写板书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smiled at everyone, though I felt like she was smiling at me the most. It wasn't a shiny smile, like Mrs. Garcia's smile, but a normal smile, like she meant it. She looked very different from what I thought teachers were going to look like. I guess I thought she'd look like Miss Fowl from Jimmy Neutron: an old lady with a big bun on top of her head. But, in fact, she looked exactly like Mon Mothma from Star Wars Episode IV: haircut kind of like a boy's, and a big white shirt kind of like a tunic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对每个人微笑，可是我觉得她给我的微笑最多。不是像加西亚太太的那种灿烂的笑，而是一种正常的笑，好像她是故意这么做的。她看起来与我想象的老师的样子很不一样。我以为她可能会像《天才小子吉米》里的鸟小姐：一个头顶上盘着个大发髻的老妇人。但是，她实际上看起来特别像《星球大战IV》中的蒙·茉诗玛：头发短短的，有点像男孩，肥大的白衬衫像一件长袍。">查看中文翻译</div>
