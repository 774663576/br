<div class="line_en">Harry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he said nothing more about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不想告诉别人，他和卢娜有了同样的幻觉——如果真是幻觉的话，所以他在车厢里坐下来，反手把门重重地关上后，再也没有谈论那些马的事。然而，他忍不住去注视着在窗外移动的那些马的侧影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron's rudeness; on the contrary, she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television programme.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢娜似乎并没有因罗恩的无礼而恼怒，相反，她盯着罗恩看了片刻，就好像他是一个还算有趣的电视节目。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road. When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid's cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet black against the dark sky, here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车排成一队，吱吱嘎嘎、摇摇晃晃地在路上行走。他们经过通向学校场地的大门两边那些高高的石柱，柱子顶上是带翼的野猪，这时哈利探着身子。想看看禁林旁边海格的小屋里有没有灯光，可是场地上一片漆黑。霍格沃茨城堡隐隐约约地越来越近：一座座高耸的塔楼在黑暗的夜空衬托下显得更加漆黑，偶尔可见一扇窗户在他们头顶上射出火红耀眼的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你到底走不走啊？”罗恩在他身边问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that Ron could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been there but invisible. Why, then, could Harry suddenly see them, and why could Ron not?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利看见的东西罗恩看不见，这种经历以前曾经有过一次，但那次只是镜子里的映像，比一百匹看上去实实在在、拉得动一队马车的牲畜要虚幻得多。如果卢娜的话是可信的，那么这些牲畜一直就存在，只是人们看不见而已。那么，为什么哈利突然能看见它们，而罗恩却看不见呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned again to look for lit windows down by the Forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within Hagrid's cabin. Unwillingly, because he had half-hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air, their blank white eyes gleaming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车丁丁当当地停在了通往橡木大门的石阶旁，哈利第一个下了车。他又转脸去望禁林那边有没有亮灯的窗户，然而海格的小屋里显然没有一点生命的迹象。他满不情愿地把目光转向那些奇怪的、皮包骨头的动物，它们静静地站在夜晚寒冷的空气中，空洞的白眼睛闪闪发亮。他心里还隐约希望它们已经消失不见了呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they reached Gryffindor's, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth-years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor house ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly-friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important things to worry about, however: he was looking over the students' heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢娜离开他们坐到拉文克劳的桌子旁去了。他们刚走到格兰芬多的桌前，金妮就被几个四年级同学大呼小叫地拉过去坐了。哈利、罗恩、赫敏和纳威在桌子中央找到几个座位坐在一起，他们一边是格兰芬多学院的鬼魂——差点没头的尼克，另一边是帕瓦蒂佩蒂尔和拉文德布朗。两个女生虚情假意、过分热情地跟哈利打招呼，这使哈利感觉到她们肯定一秒钟前还在议论自己。不过，他还有更重要的事情要操心呢。他的目光越过同学们的头顶，向礼堂前头的那张长长的教工桌子望去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The four long house tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from other houses, eyeing one another's new haircuts and robes. Again, Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礼堂里满满当当地摆着四张长长的学院餐桌，上面是没有星星的漆黑的天花板，与他们透过高高的窗户看见的外面天空一模一样。餐桌上空飘浮着一根根蜡烛，照亮了点缀在礼堂里的那几个银白色的鬼魂，照亮了同学们兴奋的面庞。他们在兴高采烈地谈话，交换暑假里的新闻，大声跟其他学院的朋友打招呼，互相审视着对方的新发型和新衣服。哈利又一次注意到，每当他走过时，人们都凑在一起交头接耳。他咬紧牙关，努力装出没看见、无所谓的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah… yeah, that'll be it," said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid's absence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是…是，就是这样。”罗恩说，似乎一下子释然了，可是赫敏咬着嘴唇，目光来回扫视着教工桌子，似乎希望能为海格的缺席找到一个有说服力的解释。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Harry at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会。”哈利毫不迟疑地说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是谁？”她敏锐地说，伸手指着教工桌子的中间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; Hagrid's size made him instantly obvious in any lineup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩和赫敏的目光也在教工桌子上扫来扫去，其实这根本没有必要。海格的那副大块头，不管在哪个阵容里都会一下予凸显出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He can't have left," said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不可能离开的。”罗恩说，声音里微微透着担忧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's not there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不在那儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, Parvati and Lavender could not hear, "Maybe he's not back yet. You know -- from his mission -- the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默了一会儿，哈利说话了，声音压得很低，以免让纳威、帕．瓦蒂和拉文德听见：“也许他还没有回来呢。你们知道的——还没完成任务——就是他暑假里为邓布刺多做的那件事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But where is he, then?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是那他去哪儿了呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course he hasn't," said Harry firmly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不会。”哈利坚决地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't think he's… hurt, or anything, do you?" said Hermione uneasily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们说他不会…受伤什么的吧，会吗？”赫敏不安地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry's eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the centre of the long staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat. Dumbledore's head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry thought, like somebody's maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes. Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的目光跟随她所指的方向望去，先是落在了邓布利多教授身上。邓布利多坐在长长的教工桌子正中间的那把金色高背椅上，穿着布满银色星星的深紫色长袍，戴着一顶配套的帽子。邓布利多把头歪向了坐在他旁边的那个女人，她正对着他的耳朵说话。哈利觉得这女人看上去就像某人的未结过婚的老姑妈，身材又矮又胖，留着一头拳曲的灰褐色短发，上面还打着一个非常难看的粉红色大蝴蝶结，跟她罩在长袍外面的那件毛绒绒的粉红色开襟毛衣很相配。这时，她微微转过脸，端起高脚酒杯喝了一日，于是哈利看见了一张苍白的、癞蛤蟆似的脸和一对眼皮松垂、眼珠凸出的眼睛。他一下子认出来了，非常震惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first-years lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礼堂里嗡嗡的谈话声渐渐平息了。一年级新生在教工桌子前排成一排，面对着其他年级的同学。麦格教授小心地把凳子放在他们前面，然后退到了后边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; his attention had been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid's. That meant the first-years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the Entrance Hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first-years entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不明白她在说什么，但也没有追问。他的注意力被刚出现在教工桌子后面的格拉普兰教授吸引住了。她走到桌子的最尽头，坐在了原本应该属于海格的座位上。那就是说，一年级新生肯定已经渡过湖来到了城堡。果然，几秒钟后，通往大厅的门开了，长长的一队看上去惊魂未定的一年级新生由麦格教授领着走进了礼堂。麦格教授手里端着一只凳子，上面放了一顶古老的巫师帽，帽子上补丁摞补丁，磨损得起了毛边的帽檐旁有一道很宽的裂口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My gran says that's rubbish," piped up Neville. "She says it's the Daily Prophet that's going downhill, not Dumbledore. She's cancelled our subscription. We believe Harry," said Neville simply. He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus. "My grans always said You-Know-Who would come back one day.

<div class="line_en">Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was, too, or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked…</div>
