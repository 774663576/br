<div class="line_en">He had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means of tying his thoughts fast to reality. Sometimes he felt as if he had found the clue to his father-in-law's absorption in trifles; perhaps even Mr. Welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had conjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them.</div>

<div class="line_en">When May appeared he thought she looked tired. She had put on the low-necked and tightly-laced dinner- dress which the Mingott ceremonial exacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair into its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan and almost faded. But she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and her eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅露面的时候他觉得她好像很疲惫。她穿上了那件低领、紧腰的餐服，按明戈特家的礼数，这是在最不拘礼节的场合的着装。她还把金色的头发做成平时那种层层盘卷的样式，她的脸色显得很苍白，几乎没有了光泽。然而她依然对他流露着平日的温存，她的蓝眼睛依然像前一天那样闪耀着光彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He and May were dining alone, all the family engagements having been postponed since Mrs. Manson Mingott's illness; and as May was the more punctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him. He knew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving about in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What became of you, dear?" she asked. "I was waiting at Granny's, and Ellen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you had to rush off on business. There's nothing wrong?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么啦，亲爱的？”她问。“我在外婆家等你，可只有埃伦一个人到了。她说让你在路上下了车，因为你急着要去办公事。没出什么事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned and moved to the looking-glass above the mantel-piece. As she stood there, lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped from its place in her intricate hair, Archer was struck by something languid and inelastic in her attitude, and wondered if the deadly monotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also. Then he remembered that, as he had left the house that morning, she had called over the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmother's so that they might drive home together. He had called back a cheery "Yes!" and then, absorbed in other visions, had forgotten his promise. Now he was smitten with compunction, yet irritated that so trifling an omission should be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage. He was weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon, without the temperature of passion yet with all its exactions. If May had spoken out her grievances (he suspected her of many) he might have laughed them away; but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a Spartan smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她转过身，走到壁炉上方那面镜子跟前，站在那里，举起长长的手臂紧一紧从她缠结的头发中滑落下来的一缕鬈发。阿切尔觉得她神态有点呆滞倦怠，他心中纳闷，他们单调至极的生活是否也对她造成了压力。这时，他想起早上他离家时，她在楼上大声对他说要在外婆家等他，这样他们可以一起坐车回家，他高高兴兴地喊了声“好的”。可是后来，由于关注其他事情，他却忘掉了自己的允诺。此刻他深感内疚，同时也有些光火：为了这样一点疏忽也记恨他，而他们结婚已经快两年了。他讨厌永远生活在那种不冷不热的蜜月之中——感情的热度已经消退，却依然维持那些苛刻要求。假如梅公开说出她的伤心事（他猜她有许多），他本来可以用笑声将其驱散的，然而她却养成了习惯，将假想的痛苦掩藏在斯巴达式的微笑背后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was, and she answered that Mrs. Mingott was still improving, but had been rather disturbed by the last news about the Beauforts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了掩饰个人的烦恼，他询问她外婆的病情如何，她回答说明戈特太太仍然在慢慢好转，不过有关博福特夫妇的最新消息却令她十分不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion, and they went in to dinner. During dinner their talk moved in its usual limited circle; but Archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to Madame Olenska, nor to old Catherine's reception of her. He was thankful for the fact, yet felt it to be vaguely ominous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事无疑是十分荒谬的。他们进餐厅吃饭，饭问他们的交谈转入平时那种有限的范围，不过阿切尔注意到妻子压根儿没提奥兰斯卡夫人的事，也不提老凯瑟琳对她的接待。他为此谢天谢地，但却朦胧感到有点不祥之兆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What news?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么消息？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went up to the library for coffee, and Archer lit a cigar and took down a volume of Michelet. He had taken to history in the evenings since May had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she saw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his own voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he read. In the days of their engagement she had simply (as he now perceived) echoed what he told her; but since he had ceased to provide her with opinions she had begun to hazard her own, with results destructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们上楼到图书室喝咖啡。阿切尔点上一支雪茄，取下一卷米歇勒的书。过去，梅一见他拿起诗集就让他大声朗读，自她表现出这一爱好之后，他晚上便开始读历史书了。不是他不喜欢自己的嗓音，而是因为他老是能够预见到她发表的评论。在他们订婚后的那些日子，她（像他现在认识到的）仅仅重复他对她讲过的东西，可自从他停止向她提供意见之后，她便试着提出自己的看法，其结果使他对所评作品的欣赏遭到破坏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was so placed that Archer, by merely raising his eyes, could see her bent above her work-frame, her ruffled elbow-sleeves slipping back from her firm round arms, the betrothal sapphire shining on her left hand above her broad gold wedding-ring, and the right hand slowly and laboriously stabbing the canvas. As she sat thus, the lamplight full on her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years to come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a weakness, a cruelty or an emotion. She had spent her poetry and romance on their short courting: the function was exhausted because the need was past. Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother, and mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr. Welland. He laid down his book and stood up impatiently; and at once she raised her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她选的位置使阿切尔一抬眼睛就能看见她俯身在绣花架上，看见她挽到胳膊肘的衣袖顺着结实滚圆的前臂溜了下来。她左手上那颗订婚蓝宝石在那枚阔面结婚金戒指上方熠熠生辉，她的右手则迟缓费力地刺着绣花布。她这样子坐着，灯光直射她那明净的额头。他暗自沮丧地想，藏在它里面的想法他永远都会一清二楚，在未来的全部岁月中，她决不会有意想不到的情绪——新奇的想法。感情的脆弱、冷酷或激动——让他感到意外。她的诗意与浪漫已经在他们短暂的求爱过程中消耗殆尽—— 机能因需求的消逝而枯竭。如今她不过是在逐渐成熟，渐渐变成她母亲的翻版而已，而且还神秘兮兮地企图通过这一过程，也把他变成一位韦兰先生。他放下书本，烦躁地站了起来。她立即抬起头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket, drew up an arm-chair to the green-shaded student lamp, and uncovered a cushion she was embroidering for his sofa. She was not a clever needle- woman; her large capable hands were made for riding, rowing and open-air activities; but since other wives embroidered cushions for their husbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她见他选了本历史书，便拿起她的针线筐，把扶手椅拉到那盏罩着绿色灯罩的台灯跟前，打开了她正在为他的沙发刺绣的靠垫。她并非巧手针黹的女子，她那双能干的大手天生是从事骑马、划船等户外活动的；不过，既然别人的妻子都为丈夫绣靠垫，她也不想忽略表现她忠诚的这一枝节。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion. What if it were SHE who was dead! If she were going to die -- to die soon -- and leave him free! The sensation of standing there, in that warm familiar room, and looking at her, and wishing her dead, was so strange, so fascinating and overmastering, that its enormity did not immediately strike him. He simply felt that chance had given him a new possibility to which his sick soul might cling. Yes, May might die -- people did: young people, healthy people like herself: she might die, and set him suddenly free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猛然间，对这个词的玩味使他产生了一个疯狂的念头：假若是她死了又会怎样？假若她快要死了——不久就死——从而使他获得自由！站在这间熟悉的、暖融融的屋子里看着她，盼望她死，这种感觉是那样地奇怪、诱人，那样不可抗拒，以致使他没有立刻想到它的凶残。他仅仅觉得那种侥幸可以给他病态的灵魂以新的依托。是的，梅有可能死——好多人死了：好多像她一样年轻、健康的人。她有可能死去，从而突然使他获得自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and forward on a rod, so that they might be closed in the evening, instead of remaining nailed to a gilt cornice, and immovably looped up over layers of lace, as in the drawing-room; and he pulled them back and pushed up the sash, leaning out into the icy night. The mere fact of not looking at May, seated beside his table, under his lamp, the fact of seeing other houses, roofs, chimneys, of getting the sense of other lives outside his own, other cities beyond New York, and a whole world beyond his world, cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他曾经坚持图书室的窗帘应装在竿上来回地拉，便于在晚上拉上，而不是钉在镀金檐板上，用环箍住不能动，像客厅里那样。他把窗帘拖过来，推起吊窗，探身到冰冷的黑夜中。仅仅是不看着坐在他桌旁灯下的梅，看一看别的住宅、屋顶、烟囱，感受到除了自己还有另外的生命，除了纽约还有另外的城市，除了自己的天地还有整整一个世界——仅此一点就使他头脑清醒，呼吸舒畅起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Six or seven days passed. Archer heard nothing from Madame Olenska, and became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence by any member of the family. He did not try to see her; to do so while she was at old Catherine's guarded bedside would have been almost impossible. In the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift, conscious, somewhere below the surface of his thoughts, of a resolve which had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window into the icy night. The strength of that resolve made it easy to wait and make no sign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六七天过去了，阿切尔压根没听到奥兰斯卡夫人的消息。他渐渐明白，家里任何人都不会当着他的面提她的名字。他也不想见她，当她在老凯瑟琳置于保护之下的床前时，去见她几乎是不可能的。由于情况不明，阿切尔只好听天由命，在思想深处的某个地方，怀着当他从图书室的窗口探身到冰冷的黑暗时所产生的那个主意。靠这股力量的支持，他不动声色地安心等待着。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was nothing surprising in the request, for the old lady was steadily recovering, and she had always openly declared that she preferred Archer to any of her other grandsons-in- law. May gave the message with evident pleasure: she was proud of old Catherine's appreciation of her husband.</div>

Beside her was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved globe, over which a green paper shade had been balanced.

<div class="line_en">Archer wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties; but suddenly she broke out: "Well, it's settled, anyhow: she's going to stay with me, whatever the rest of the family say! She hadn't been here five minutes before I'd have gone down on my knees to keep her -- if only, for the last twenty years, I'd been able to see where the floor was!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿切尔心中纳闷，她是不是因为生病脑子糊涂了。但她突然大声地说：“咳，不管怎样，事情总算解决了：她将跟我呆在一起，家里人说什么我才不管呢！那天她到这里还不到5分钟，我就想跪下求她留下来了。在过去的20年中，我一直没弄清问题的症结呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Archer listened in silence, and she went on: "They'd talked me over, as no doubt you know: persuaded me, Lovell, and Letterblair, and Augusta Welland, and all the rest of them, that I must hold out and cut off her allowance, till she was made to see that it was her duty to go back to Olenski. They thought they'd convinced me when the secretary, or whatever he was, came out with the last proposals: handsome proposals I confess they were. After all, marriage is marriage, and money's money -- both useful things in their way… and I didn't know what to answer --" She broke off and drew a long breath, as if speaking had become an effort. "But the minute I laid eyes on her, I said: `You sweet bird, you! Shut you up in that cage again? Never!' And now it's settled that she's to stay here and nurse her Granny as long as there's a Granny to nurse. It's not a gay prospect, but she doesn't mind; and of course I've told Letterblair that she's to be given her proper allowance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿切尔默不作声地听着，她接着说：“你肯定知道，他们一直在劝我：洛弗尔，还有莱特布赖，奥古斯塔·韦兰，以及其他所有的人，都一直在劝我不要让步，要断绝对她的贴补，直到让她认识到，回到奥兰斯基身边是她的职责。那个秘书还是什么人来的时候，他们以为已经说服了我。他带来了最新的提议，我承认那些条件很慷慨。可归根到底，婚姻是婚姻，钱财是钱财——各有各的用途……我当时不知怎么回答才好——”她突然停下来，深深吸了口气，仿佛说话变得很吃力。 “可当时我把眼睛对着她说：‘你这只可爱的小鸟！再把你关到那个笼子里去吗？绝对不行！’现在定下来了。她将呆在这儿，侍候她的祖母——只要她还有个祖母可侍候。这算不上愉快的前景，但她不在乎。当然，我已经嘱咐莱特布赖，她要得到一份适当的补贴。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young man heard her with veins aglow; but in his confusion of mind he hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain. He had so definitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment he could not readjust his thoughts. But gradually there stole over him the delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities miraculously provided. If Ellen had consented to come and live with her grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the impossibility of giving him up. This was her answer to his final appeal of the other day: if she would not take the extreme step he had urged, she had at last yielded to half-measures. He sank back into the thought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk everything, and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻人异常兴奋地听着她讲，但脑子里却一片混乱，说不清这个消息带给自己的是喜还是忧。他已经毅然决然地确定了自己的行动方针，一时竟无法调整他的思路。然而渐渐地，他意识到他的困难将会推延，机会却会奇迹般地出现，心头不觉美滋滋的。如果埃伦已经同意过来跟祖母一起生活，那必然是因为她认识到放弃他是根本不可能的。这就是她对那天他最后请求的回答：如果她不肯采取他迫切要求的极端步骤，那么，她终于屈从了折衷的办法。他又陷入那种不期而至的欣慰之中：一位准备孤注一掷的男人却突然尝到了化险为夷的甜头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, my dear, I always knew you were on her side; and that's why I sent for you today, and why I said to your pretty wife, when she proposed to come with you: 'No, my dear, I'm pining to see Newland, and I don't want anybody to share our transports.' For you see, my dear --" she drew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted, and looked him full in the eyes --"you see, we shall have a fight yet. The family don't want her here, and they'll say it's because I've been ill, because I'm a weak old woman, that she's persuaded me. I'm not well enough yet to fight them one by one, and you've got to do it for me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，亲爱的，我一直就知道你是站在她一边的，正因为如此，我今天才把你叫来；也正是为此，当你那位美丽的妻子提出跟你一起来时，我才对她说：‘不，亲爱的，我极想见见纽兰，我不想让任何人分享我们的快活。’因为，听我说，亲爱的——”她把头尽量往后仰，达到下颏所能支撑的最大限度，然后直视着他的眼睛说：“你瞧，我们还要进行战斗呢。家里人不想让她留在这儿，他们会说是因为我生病了，因为我是个病弱的老妇人，她才说服了我。我还没有完全康复，还不能一个接一个地跟他们斗，你必须替我干。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She paused for this announcement to produce its effect. "That's what she's reduced me to already. The day after she got here she put on her best bonnet, and told me, as cool as a cucumber, that she was going to call on Regina Beaufort. `I don't know her; who is she?' says I. `She's your grand-niece, and a most unhappy woman,' she says. `She's the wife of a scoundrel,' I answered. `Well,' she says, `and so am I, and yet all my family want me to go back to him.' Well, that floored me, and I let her go; and finally one day she said it was raining too hard to go out on foot, and she wanted me to lend her my carriage. `What for?' I asked her; and she said: `To go and see cousin Regina -- COUSIN! Now, my dear, I looked out of the window, and saw it wasn't raining a drop; but I understood her, and I let her have the carriage… After all, Regina's a brave woman, and so is she; and I've always liked courage above everything."</div>
