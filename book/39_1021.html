<div class="line_en">"That's all right, Farid," I said. I managed a tired smile. "You have mouths to feed." A dog was standing next to the truck now, propped on its rear legs, paws on the truck's door, tail wagging. Sohrab was petting the dog. "I guess he goes to Islamabad for now," I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">I SLEPT THROUGH almost the entire four-hour ride to Islamabad. I dreamed a lot, and most of it I only remember as a hodge podge of images, snippets of visual memory flashing in my head like cards in a Rolodex: Baba marinating lamb for my thirteenth birthday party. Soraya and I making love for the first time, the sun rising in the east, our ears still ringing from the wedding music, her henna-painted hands laced in mine. The time Baba had taken Hassan and me to a strawberry field in Jalalabad -- the owner had told us we could eat as much as we wanted to as long as we bought at least four kilos -- and how we'd both ended up with bellyaches. How dark, almost black, Hassan's blood had looked on the snow, dropping from the seat of his pants. Blood is a powerful thing, bachem. Khala Jamila patting Soraya's knee and saying, God knows best, maybe it wasn't meant to be. Sleeping on the roof of my father's house. Baba saying that the only sin that mattered was theft. When you tell a lie, you steal a man's right to the truth. Rahim Khan on the phone, telling me there was a way to be good again. A way to be good again…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到伊斯兰堡要四个小时，我几乎一路睡过去。我梦到很多东西，而我所记得的，只有大杂烩似的景象，栩栩如生的记忆碎片如同旋转架上的名片，不断在我脑里闪过。爸爸为我十三岁生日腌制羊肉。索拉雅和我初尝云雨，太阳从东边升起，我们耳里仍有婚礼音乐的袅袅余音，她涂了指甲花的手和我十指相扣。爸爸带我和哈桑到贾拉拉巴特的草莓地——主人告诉我们，只要买四公斤，我们就可随意大吃，最后我们两个撑得肚子发痛。哈桑的血从臀部的裤子滴下来，滴在雪地上，看上去那么暗，几乎是黑色的。血缘是最重要的，我的孩子。雅米拉阿姨拍拍索拉雅的膝盖说，只有真主最清楚，也许事情不是这样的。睡在爸爸房子的屋顶上。爸爸说惟一的罪行是盗窃。当你说谎，你偷走了人们知道真相的权利。拉辛汗在电话里，告诉我那儿有条再次成为好人的路。一条再次成为好人的路…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THE HOTEL ROOM was a vast improvement over the one in Kabul where Farid and I had stayed. The sheets were clean, the carpet vacuumed, and the bathroom spotless. There was shampoo, soap, razors for shaving, a bathtub, and towels that smelled like lemon. And no bloodstains on the walls. One other thing: a television set sat on the dresser across from the two single beds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅馆的房间比我和法里德在喀布尔住过那间好得太多了。被褥很干净，地毯用吸尘器吸过，卫生间没有污迹，里面有洗发水、香皂、刮胡刀、浴缸，有散发着柠檬香味的毛巾。墙上没有血迹。还有，两张单人床前面的柜子上摆着个电视机。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Farid found a small hotel on a side street running along the foot of the Margalla Hills. We passed the famous Shah Faisal Mosque on the way there, reputedly the biggest mosque in the world, with its giant concrete girders and soaring minarets. Sohrab perked up at the sight of the mosque, leaned out of the window and looked at it until Farid turned a corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">If Peshawar was the city that reminded me of what Kabul used to be, then Islamabad was the city Kabul could have become someday. The streets were wider than Peshawar's, cleaner, and lined with rows of hibiscus and flame trees. The bazaars were more organized and not nearly as clogged with rickshaws and pedestrians. The architecture was more elegant too, more modern, and I saw parks where roses and jasmine bloomed in the shadows of trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look!" I said to Sohrab. I turned it on manually-no remote -- and turned the dial. I found a children's show with two fluffy sheep puppets singing in Urdu. Sohrab sat on one of the beds and drew his knees to his chest. Images from the TV reflected in his green eyes as he watched, stone-faced, rocking back and forth. I remembered the time I'd promised Hassan I'd buy his family a color TV when we both grew up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看！”我对索拉博说。我用手将它打开——没有遥控器，转动旋钮。我调到一个儿童节目，两只毛茸茸的卡通绵羊唱着乌尔都语歌曲。索拉博坐在床上，膝盖抵着胸膛。他看得入迷，绿眼珠反射出电视机里面的影像，前后晃动身子。我想起有一次，我承诺哈桑，在我们长大之后，要给他家里买台彩电。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I returned to the hotel room and found Sohrab lying on the bed, curled up in a big C. His eyes were closed but I couldn't tell if he was sleeping. He had shut off the television. I sat on my bed and grimaced with pain, wiped the cool sweat off my brow. I wondered how much longer it would hurt to get up, sit down, roll over in bed. I wondered when I'd be able to eat solid food. I wondered what I'd do with the wounded little boy lying on the bed, though a part of me already knew.</div>

<div class="line_en">WHEN I WOKE UP, the room was darker. The slice of sky peeking between the curtains was the purple of twilight turning into night. The sheets were soaked and my head pounded. I'd been dreaming again, but I couldn't remember what it had been about. My heart gave a sick lurch when I looked to Sohrab's bed and found it empty I called his name. The sound of my voice startled me. It was disorienting, sitting in a dark hotel room, thousands of miles from home, my body broken, calling the name of a boy I'd only met a few days ago. I called his name again and heard nothing. I struggled out of bed, checked the bathroom, looked in the narrow hallway outside the room. He was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="醒来之后，房间变黑了。窗帘之间露出一线天光，那是即将转入黑夜的紫色斜晖。汗水浸透被褥，我脑袋昏重。我又做梦了，但忘记梦到什么。我望向索拉博的床，发现它是空的，心里一沉。我叫他的名字，发出的嗓音吓了自己一跳。那真是茫然失措，坐在阴暗的旅馆房间，离家万里，身体伤痕累累，呼唤着一个几天前才遇到的男孩的名字。我又喊了他的名字，没听到回答。我挣扎着起床，查看卫生间，朝外面那条狭窄的走廊望去。他不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I locked the door and hobbled to the manager's office in the lobby, one hand clutching the rail along the walkway for support. There was a fake, dusty palm tree in the corner of the lobby and flying pink flamingos on the wallpaper. I found the hotel manager reading a newspaper behind the Formica-topped check-in counter. I described Sohrab to him, asked if he'd seen him. He put down his paper and took off his reading glasses. He had greasy hair and a square-shaped little mustache speckled with gray. He smelled vaguely of some tropical fruit I couldn't quite recognize.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我锁上房门，一只手扶在走廊的栏杆上，跌跌撞撞走到大堂的经理办公室。大堂的角落有株满是尘灰的假棕榈树，粉红的火烈鸟在壁纸上飞舞。我在塑料贴面的登记柜台后面，找到正在看报纸的经理。我向他描绘索拉博的样子，问他有没有见到过。他放下报纸，摘掉老花镜。他的头发油腻，整齐的小胡子有些灰白，身上依稀有种我叫不上名字的热带水果味道。">查看中文翻译</div>

We sat in silence, me leaning against the tree, Sohrab next to me, knees to his chest. We listened to the call to prayer, watched the building's hundreds of lights come on as daylight faded. The mosque sparkled like a diamond in the dark. It lit up the sky, Sohrab's face. "Have you ever been to Mazar-i-Sharif?" Sohrab said, his chin resting on his kneecaps.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You must miss your parents very much," I said. I wondered if he'd seen the Taliban drag his parents out into the street. I hoped he hadn't. "Do you miss your parents?" he asked, resting his cheek on his knees, looking up at me. "Do I miss my parents? Well, I never met my mother. My father died a few years ago, and, yes, I do miss him. Sometimes a lot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你一定很想念你的父母。”我说。我在想他有没有看到塔利班将他的父母拖到街上。我希望他没有。“你想念你的父母吗？”他问，把脸颊放在膝盖上，抬眼看着我。“我想念我的父母吗？嗯，我从没见过我的妈妈。我爸爸几年前死了，是的，我想念他。有时很想。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Father took me to the Blue Mosque," Sohrab said. "I remember there were so many pigeons outside the masjid, and they weren't afraid of people. They came right up to us.

<div class="line_en">He brought the photo to within an inch of his face, turned it so the light from the mosque fell on it. He looked at it for a long time. I thought he might cry, but he didn't. He just held it in both hands, traced his thumb over its surface. I thought of a line I'd read somewhere, or maybe I'd heard someone say it: There are a lot of children in Afghanistan, but little childhood. He stretched his hand to give it back to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将相片放在面前几英寸的地方，转了一下，以便让清真寺的灯光照在上面。他久久看着它。我想他也许会哭，但他只是双手拿着照片，拇指在它上面抚摸着。我想起一句不知道在什么地方看来的话，或者是从别人口里听来的：阿富汗有很多儿童，但没有童年。他伸出手，把它递给我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you." He looked at the photo again and stowed it in the pocket of his vest. A horse-drawn cart clip-clopped by in the parking lot. Little bells dangled from the horse's neck and jingled with each step.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我伸手去碰他，他身子退缩。我收回手。“不会，当然不会。”我说。我想把他拉近，抱着他，告诉他世界曾经对他不仁，他别无选择。他的脸扭曲绷紧，试图保持平静：“爸爸常说，甚至连伤害坏人也是不对的。因为他们不知道什么是好的，还因为坏人有时也会变好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're not dirty, and you're not full of sin." I touched his arm again and he drew away. I reached again, gently, and pulled him to me. "I won't hurt you," I whispered. "I promise." He resisted a little. Slackened. He let me draw him to me and rested his head on my chest. His little body convulsed in my arms with each sob. A kinship exists between people who've fed from the same breast. Now, as the boy's pain soaked through my shirt, I saw that a kinship had taken root between us too. What had happened in that room with Assef had irrevocably bound us. I'd been looking for the right time, the right moment, to ask the question that had been buzzing around in my head and keeping me up at night. I decided the moment was now, right here, right now, with the bright lights of the house of God shining on us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不脏，你身上没有罪。”我又去碰他的手臂，他抽开。我再伸出手，轻轻地将他拉近。“我不会伤害你，”我低声说，“我保证。”他挣扎了一下，全身放松，让我将他拉近，把头靠在我胸膛上。他小小的身体在我怀里随着每声啜泣抽动。喝着同样的奶水长大的人之间会有亲情。如今，就在这个男孩痛苦的泪水浸湿我的衣裳时，我看到我们身上也有亲情开始生长出来。在那间房间里面和阿塞夫发生的事情让我们紧紧联系在一起，不可分开。我一直在寻找恰当的机会、恰当的时间，问出那个萦绕在我脑里、让我彻夜无眠的问题。我决定现在就问，就在此地，就在此刻，就在照射着我们的真主房间的蓝色灯光之下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">FOR A WEEK, neither one of us mentioned what I had asked him, as if the question hadn't been posed at all. Then one day, Sohrab and I took a taxicab to the Daman-e-Koh Viewpoint -- or "the hem of the mountain." Perched midway up the Margalla Hills, it gives a panoramic view of Islamabad, its rows of clean, tree-lined avenues and white houses. The driver told us we could see the presidential palace from up there. "If it has rained and the air is clear, you can even see past Rawalpindi," he said. I saw his eyes in his rearview mirror, skipping from Sohrab to me, back and forth, back and forth. I saw my own face too. It wasn't as swollen as before, but it had taken on a yellow tint from my assortment of fading bruises. We sat on a bench in one of the picnic areas, in the shade of a gum tree. It was a warm day, the sun perched high in a topaz blue sky. On benches nearby, families snacked on samosas and pakoras. Somewhere, a radio played a Hindi song I thought I remembered from an old movie, maybe Pakeeza. Kids, many of them Sohrab's age, chased soccer balls, giggling, yelling. I thought about the orphanage in Karteh-Seh, thought about the rat that had scurried between my feet in Zaman's office. My chest tightened with a surge of unexpected anger at the way my countrymen were destroying their own land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整整一个星期，我们两个都没提起我所问过他的，似乎那个问题从来没被说出来。接着某天，我和索拉博坐出租车，前往“达曼尼科”——它的意思是“那座山的边缘”——观景台。它坐落在玛加拉山半腰，可以看到伊斯兰堡的全景，树木夹道的纵横街路，还有白色房子。司机告诉我们，从上面能看到总统的宫殿。“如果刚下过雨，空气清新，你们甚至能看到拉瓦尔品第【Rawalpindi，伊斯兰堡附近古城】。”他说。我从他那边的观后镜，看见他扫视着我和索拉博，来回看个不停。我也看到自己的脸，不像过去那样浮肿，但各处消退中的淤伤在它上面留下黄色的痕迹。我们坐在橡胶树的阴影里面，野餐区的长椅上。那天很暖和，太阳高悬在澄蓝的天空中，旁边的长椅上坐着几个家庭，在吃土豆饼和炸蔬菜饼。不知何处传来收音机播放印度音乐的声音，我想我在某部旧电影里面听过，也许是《纯洁》【Pakeeza，1971年公映，巴基斯坦电影】吧。一些孩子追逐着足球，他们多数跟索拉博差不多年纪，咯咯发笑，大声叫喊。我想起卡德察区那个恤孤院，想起在察曼的办公室，那只老鼠从我双脚之间穿过。我心口发紧，猛然升起一阵始料不及的怒火，为着我的同胞正在摧毁他们的家园。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What?" Sohrab asked. I forced a smile and told him it wasn't important. We unrolled one of the hotel's bathroom towels on the picnic table and played panjpar on it. It felt good being there, with my half brother's son, playing cards, the warmth of the sun patting the back of my neck. The song ended and another one started, one I didn't recognize.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”索拉博问。我挤出笑脸，跟他说没什么。我们把一条从旅馆卫生间取来的浴巾铺在野餐桌上，在它上面玩起番吉帕。在那儿跟我同父异母兄弟的儿子一起玩牌，温暖的阳光照射在我脖子后面，那感觉真好。那首歌结束了，另外一首响起，我没听过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh," he said. I was hoping he'd ask more, but he dealt another hand and asked if we could eat. I opened the paper bag and gave him his meatball sandwich. My lunch consisted of yet another cup of blended bananas and oranges -- I'd rented Mrs. Fayyaz's blender for the week. I sucked through the straw and my mouth filled with the sweet, blended fruit. Some of it dripped from the corner of my lips. Sohrab handed me a napkin and watched me dab at my lips. I smiled and he smiled back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”他说。我希望他会多问几句，但他又甩出一手牌，问是不是可以吃东西了。我打开纸袋，给他肉丸夹饼。我的午餐是一杯混合的香蕉汁和橙汁——那个星期我租了费亚兹太太的榨汁机。我用吸管吮着，满嘴甜甜的混合果汁。有些从嘴角流出来，索拉博递给我一张纸巾，看着我擦嘴唇。我朝他微笑，他也微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THE LAWN OUTSIDE the American embassy in Islamabad was neatly mowed, dotted with circular clusters of flowers, bordered by razor-straight hedges. The building itself was like a lot of buildings in Islamabad: flat and white. We passed through several road blocks to get there and three different security officials conducted a body search on me after the wires in my jaws set off the metal detectors. When we finally stepped in from the heat, the airconditioning hit my face like a splash of ice water. The secretary in the lobby, a fifty-something, lean-faced blond woman, smiled when I gave her my name. She wore a beige blouse and black slacks -- the first woman I'd seen in weeks dressed in something other than a burqa or a shalwar-kameez. She looked me up on the appointment list, tapping the eraser end of her pencil on the desk. She found my name and asked me to take a seat.</div>

He looked at his tomato plants as he rubbed lotion into his hands, cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. Then he closed the drawer, put his elbows on the desktop, and exhaled. "So," he said, crinkling his gray eyes against the smoke, "tell me your story."</div>

His breath fogged the glass, cleared, fogged it again. I waited for him to ask me about the meeting but he didn't. ON THE OTHER SIDE of the closed bathroom door the water was running. Since the day we'd checked into the hotel, Sohrab took a long bath every night before bed. In Kabul, hot running water had been like fathers, a rare commodity. Now Sohrab spent almost an hour a night in the bath, soaking in the soapy water, scrubbing. Sitting on the edge of the bed, I called Soraya. I glanced at the thin line of light under the bathroom door. Do you feel clean yet, Sohrab?</div>

He wore a brown corduroy suit with leather elbow patches and carried a worn, overstuffed briefcase. The handle was missing, so he clutched the briefcase to his chest. He was the sort of fellow who started a lot of sentences with a laugh and an unnecessary apology, like I'm sorry, I'll be there at five. Laugh. When I had called him, he had insisted on coming out to meet us. "I'm sorry, the cabbies in this town are sharks," he said in perfect English, without a trace of an accent.

<div class="line_en">Omar nodded, his brow furrowed. "Well, it's like this. In the aftermath of a disaster, whether it be natural or man-made -- and the Taliban are a disaster, Amir, believe me -- it's always difficult to ascertain that a child is an orphan. Kids get displaced in refugee camps, or parents just abandon them because they can't take care of them. Happens all the time. So the INS won't grant a visa unless it's clear the child meets the definition of an eligible orphan. I'm sorry, I know it sounds ridiculous, but you need death certificates."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥马尔点头，双眉紧锁。“好了，就这样。灾难之后，不管天灾还是人祸——塔利班真是一场大灾难，阿米尔，相信我——一个孩子是否孤儿，总是很难判断。孩子们被遗弃在难民营，或者被双亲抛弃，因为他们无法加以照料。这些情况向来都有。所以除非孩子满足孤儿的法律定义，否则移民局不会放发签证。我很抱歉，我知道这听起来很荒唐，但你需要一纸死亡证书。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"But let's suppose that somehow Afghanistan gets its act together," Omar said, crossing his arms on his protruding belly. "It still may not permit this adoption. In fact, even the more moderate Muslim nations are hesitant with adoptions because in many of those countries, Islamic law, Shari'a, doesn't recognize adoption."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我叹气，揉揉眼睛。眼睛后面突突发痛。“但是让我们假设不管怎样，阿富汗人肯帮忙。”奥马尔说，双手交叉放在隆起的肚子上，“这次收养仍有可能被拒绝。实际上，就算是那些较为温和的穆斯林国家，对收养也不无疑虑，因为在多数这些国家中，穆斯林教法不赞同收养。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry, I'm telling you how the INS works, Amir," Omar said, touching my arm. He glanced at Sohrab and smiled. Turned back to me. "Now, a child has to be legally adopted according to the laws and regulations of his own country. But when you have a country in turmoil, say a country like Afghanistan, government offices are busy with emergencies, and processing adoptions won't be a top priority."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很抱歉，我在告诉你的是移民局怎么工作，阿米尔。”奥马尔说，碰碰我的手臂。他望向索拉博，露出微笑，然后看着我。“说到这里，一个孩子必须根据他自己国家的法规被合法地收养。但假如你碰到一个乱糟糟的国家，比如说阿富汗，政府官员会忙于处理各种突发事件，处理收养事宜不会得到优先考虑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
