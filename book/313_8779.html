<div class="line_en">Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of subjects -- on miracle plays, on mediaeval pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the warships of the future -- handling each as though he had made a special study of it. His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces, though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew that this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time -- as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge -- he could hardly leave at a moment's notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我投身到化学分析实验中，使我的头脑得到了彻底的休息。我们有一位伟大的政治家曾经说过，转换一下工作是最好的休息。这句话一点儿也不错。当我成功地溶解了我研究的那种碳氢化合物以后，我就回过头来，思考肖尔托的问题，把这问题重新考虑了一遍。我所派遣的孩子们在上下游都搜遍了，也没有结果。这只汽船既没有停泊在任何码头上，又没有回去。也不太可能为了灭迹而自沉，但是，如果实在找不着，这当然还算是一个可能的假设。我知道斯莫尔多少有些狡猾，可是我认为，他还使不出什么老谋深算的手段。通常，受过良好教育的人才会有那样的本事。后来我想到，他既然在伦敦居住过一段时间——因为我们有证据证明，他对本地治里别墅进行过长期监视——既然如此，他不可能说走就走，好歹需要一点儿时间来安排自己的事务，哪怕只有一天。无论如何，这是一个可能性。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It seems to me to be a little weak," said I; "it is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看这个可能性不大，”我说，“他更有可能在行动以前早已做了安排。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their headquarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我不这么认为。对他来说，万一有什么需要，他这个巢穴是一个重要的隐蔽处，他绝不会轻易放弃，除非他确知这个巢穴对他已经毫无用处。然后，我又想到了一点。乔纳森·斯莫尔一定会料想到，他同谋的那副怪相，不管怎么装扮，都会引起别人说长道短，并且可能会令人联系到诺伍德惨案上去。他这么聪明，能够想到这一点。他们趁着天黑才从老巢出发，他肯定希望在天明以前赶回去。根据史密斯太太所说，他们在史密斯码头上船的时候是三点钟。再过一个多钟头，天就要大亮，行人也多了。所以我认为，他们不会走得太远。他们给了史密斯不少钱，叫他不要声张，预订下他的船，以备最后逃跑，然后携带宝物，赶回住处。在一两天内，他们还有时间看看报纸上的说法，看是否有什么疑窦，然后，趁着某一个黑夜，他们前往格雷夫森德或唐斯锚地，在那里，他们肯定早已订好了船位，逃往美洲或其他殖民地去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth -- Jacobson's -- I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. 'There ain't naught amiss with her rudder,' said the foreman. 'There she lies, with the red streaks.' At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner. He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. 'I want her to-night at eight o'clock,' said he --'eight o'clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting.' They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an alehouse; so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at the water's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是这些非常简单的事，才更容易被忽略。无论如何，我决定照着这个想法去进行侦查。我立刻穿了这身普通的水手服，到下游的每一个船坞里去询问。问了十五个船坞，全失败了，可是问到第十六个——雅各布森船坞时，我得知，在两天前，曾有一个装木腿的人把‘曙光’号送进船坞，让他们修理一下船舵。‘那船舵一点儿毛病也没有，’工头跟我说，‘就是那艘船，画着红线的。’正在那时，来了一个人，不是别人，正是失踪的船主莫迪凯·史密斯。他喝了不少酒。我自然不认识他，是他喊出了自己的名字和船的名字。‘我今晚八点要船，’他说道，‘准八点，记住了，我有两位客人，耽误不得。’匪徒们一定给了他不少的钱，因为他身上装满了钱，还对着工人们，把银币拍得叮当作响。我跟踪了他一段距离，但他跑进了一家酒馆，于是，我又回到船坞，在途中碰巧遇到了我的一个小帮手，就把他安置在那里，盯住汽船。我让他站在船坞的出口处，看到船出坞，就向我们挥动手巾，作为暗号。我们就在河上歇一下吧，这次要是没有人赃俱获，那才是怪事呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small and looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it. I might hand the launch over to some boatbuilder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours' notice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然。我认为，这只船虽然没有被我们发现，可也不会离我们太远。我站在斯莫尔的角度上，根据他这个人的智商来设想。他可能会想，如果警察碰巧追踪他的话，那么，把船遣回，或是让它停在码头，都会使他容易被追踪到。那怎样才能把船隐藏起来，同时，要用它的时候，又能召之即来呢？我思考着，如果我站在他的立场上，我会怎么办。我只想得到一个办法。我可能会把汽船交给某个造船工或修船工，指示他对它做一些小修整。然后，船就会被停放在他的船棚或船坞，如此就可有效地隐蔽起来，同时，只要提前几个小时通知，我就能够使用它了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不管这几个人是不是真的凶手，你的计划都是很周密的，”琼斯说，“不过，要是让我来处理，我一定派几个能干的警察到雅各布森船坞去，等他们一来，就当场逮捕他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那样，我的时光就全浪费了。我认为，匪徒们的住处，史密斯九成九是不知道的。他只要有酒喝、有钱花就行，问那么多干吗？匪徒们派人通知他该干什么就行啦。我各方面都考虑到了，认为这是最好的办法。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked like a great metallic heart. Her sharp, steep prow cut through the still river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track.</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky, uncertain twilight was settling into a clear, starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly into the dainty Aurora. Jones turned our searchlight upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees, over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass, which looked like a Newfound land dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boats-lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clenched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downward there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries, there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a little black man -- the smallest I have ever seen -- with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed, but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with half animal fury.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，正在这时，不幸的事发生了，一只拖船拖了三只平底船，横在我们面前。幸而我们急转船舵，才避免了和它相撞，可是，等到我们绕过它们，继续前进的时候，‘曙光’号已经又走远了足有两百多码。不过还能看得到它，当时，阴暗、朦胧的暮色已经变成了星斗满天的晴朗夜空。我们的锅炉已烧到了极限，驱船前进的力量异常强大，脆弱的船壳咯吱作响，颤动不已。我们已经穿过了伦敦桥，经过了西印度码头和长长的戴普弗德河区，绕过了恶犬岛，又继续前进。我们眼前的黑影现在已清晰地呈现为精巧的‘曙光’号。琼斯用我们的探照灯直射向它，我们能清楚地看见甲板上的人影。一个人坐在船尾，两腿之间有一个黑的东西，他正伏在上面。旁边还躺着一个黑影，看上去像一只纽芬兰狗。一个男孩把舵，借着锅炉的红光，我能看见老史密斯光着上身，正在拼命地加煤。起初，他们或许还不能肯定我们是否在追赶他们，可是现在，他们每一次转角绕弯，我们都紧紧地跟着，他们也就明确地知道，我们是在追他们了。到格林尼治的时候，两船的距离约有三百步。到布莱克沃尔时，两船相隔已不过二百五十步了。我奔波了一生，在不少国家里追赶过不少野兽，然而都没有像今晚在泰晤士河上那般惊险刺激——这场疯狂的追人游戏快得更像是飞一般。我们和他们在一步步地接近。在寂静的夜里，我们可以很清楚地听到他们船上机器的轰隆作响。坐在船尾的那个人还是蹲在甲板上，两手挥舞着，似乎很忙，还时不时地抬起头来，估量两船的距离。我们相距更近了。琼斯喝令他们停下。我们距离他们只有四支船那么长了，两船仍在急速飞驰。这时已近河口，一边岸上是巴金平地，另一侧岸上则是寂寥的普拉姆斯梯德沼泽。船尾那个人听见我们的喊叫声，从甲板上站起来，朝我们挥动双拳，高声怒骂。他的身体健壮，个子高大，两腿叉开站在那里，我看见他的右边大腿下面只有一根木柱支撑着。听到他尖声怒骂，他旁边蜷伏着的一团东西动了起来。它慢慢地站了起来，原来是一个矮小的黑人——我从没见过这么小的人——他有一颗畸形的大脑袋，上面长着一堆蓬乱的头发。福尔摩斯已经掏出了手枪，我一看见这个野蛮、畸形的家伙，就也把手枪掏了出来。他围着一件黑色的好似毯子的东西，只露着脸，可就是这张脸，也足以令人彻夜无眠。我从没有看见过这样狰狞、凶恶的面相。他那对小眼睛凶光闪闪，厚厚的嘴唇从牙根向上翻撅着，他带着野兽般的狂怒，向我们龇牙咧嘴，狂喊乱叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were within a boat's strength by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，我们彼此之间只有一船之隔了，我们的猎物唾手可得。我看到那两个人站着，那个白人叉着两腿，不断地咒骂，那个邪恶的矮人仰着丑陋的脸，在我们船的灯光下，朝我们咬着发黄的牙齿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fire if he raises his hand," said Holmes quietly.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and, with a kind of choking cough, fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch, with a dull thud, ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forward or backward. He yelled in impotent rage and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stem. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly upstream again, we flashed our searchlight in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸而我们能清楚地看到他。就在我们看着他时，他从毯子里掏出了一段好似戒尺的短圆木棒，搁在唇边。我们的手枪同时发射了。他转了一圈，两手一挥，发出一声干咳般的声音，便向一侧倒去，跌入河中。刹那之间，我就看到，他那一双狠毒的眼睛在白色的漩涡之中消失了。这时，那个装木腿的人冲向船舵，用尽全身力量扳那舵柄，使船突然向南岸冲去，我们以相差几英尺的距离躲开了它的船尾，总算没有撞上。我们随即转弯追上前去，但它已经接近南岸了。岸上是一片荒凉的旷野，月光照着空旷的沼地，地面上聚着一片片死水和一堆堆腐烂了的植物。随着一声沉重的撞击，那只汽船冲上了泥泞的河岸，船头耸向空中，船尾没在水里。那匪徒跳上岸，可是，他那只木腿立即整个陷入了泥淖中。他用力挣扎，但徒劳无功。他连一步也进退不得。他狂喊乱叫，用另一条腿拼命踢着泥土，可是那木腿却在泥里愈陷愈深。等我们把船靠了岸，他已经死死地钉在那里了，我们只得从船上扔一条绳子过去，套住他的肩膀，才像拉鱼一般把他拉出来，并拖上了船。史密斯父子二人愁眉苦脸地坐在自己的船上，但一听到我们的命令，他们就乖乖地到这边的船上来了。我们把‘曙光’号拉出来，与我们的船头紧紧拴在一起。一只印度工艺的结实铁箱就摆在甲板上。不用问就知道，这就是装着肖尔托家的不祥宝物的箱子。箱子上没有钥匙，非常沉重，我们小心地把它搬到我们的舱里。我们慢慢地向上游回驶，一路上不断地用探照灯向四面照射，可是那岛民早已不见踪影。我们国度的这位奇异访客已葬身在泰晤士河底的黑泥之中了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"See here," said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. "We were hardly quick enough with our pistols." There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant we fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.</div>
