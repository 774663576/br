<div class="line_en">They passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones, gazing at the dark rock of Orthanc, and its many windows, a menace still in the desolation that lay all about it. The waters had now nearly all subsided. Here and there gloomy pools remained, covered with scum and wreckage; but most of the wide circle was bare again, a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock, pitted with blackened holes, and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that. At the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great storm; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains. Across the waste they saw riders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already they were drawing near to Orthanc.</div>

<div class="line_en">They followed what was left of the road from the gates to Orthanc, going slowly, for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed. The riders, seeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them. Gandalf rode forward to meet them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you indeed?" said Gandalf. "Well, I do not. I have now a last task to do before I go: I must pay Saruman a farewell visit.

<div class="line_en">"And how will you learn that, Master Dwarf?" said Gandalf. "Saruman could look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. And are you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits? Well, we shall see, perhaps. He may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together. But I have ordered all the Ents to remove themselves from sight, so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“矮人先生，你要怎么分辨呢？”甘道夫问道：“如果他觉得有必要，萨鲁曼在你的眼中或许会看起来和我一样，经过了这么多，难道你还不能够了解他的邪恶吗？好吧，或许我们到时候就会知道了，等下他搞不好不敢在这么多人之前露面。不过，我已经说服所有的树人离开他的视线，或许我们可以让他走出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They came now to the foot of Orthanc. It was black, and the rock gleamed as if it were wet. The many faces of the stone had sharp edges as though they had been newly chiselled. A few scorings, and small flake-like splinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the Ents.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great door, high above the ground; and over it was a shuttered window, opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn by some unknown art of the same black stone. This was the only entrance to the tower; but many tall windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在塔的东方，两块巨岩交会之处，有一座巨大的门；该处离地相当的高，门上则是一扇紧闭的窗户，俯瞰着一座被铁条所封闭的阳台。通往大门的则是二十七阶宽大的石阶，是用同一类黑岩雕凿出来的。这是高塔唯一入口，上面的许多窗户从远方看来，像是兽角之上的许多小眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The window closed. They waited. Suddenly another voice spoke, low and melodious, its very sound an enchantment. Those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom report the words that they heard; and if they did, they wondered, for little power remained in them. Mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking, all that it said seemed wise and reasonable, and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves. When others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast; and if they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of those under the spell. For some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke to them, and when it spoke to another they smiled, as men do who see through a juggler's trick while others gape at it. For many the sound of the voice alone was enough to hold them enthralled; but for those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far away, and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them. But none were unmoved; none rejected its pleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will, so long as its master had control of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="窗户关上了，他们静静地等着，突然间，另一个低沉优美的声音说话了，它的每字每句都如同音乐一般魅惑人心，不疑有他的人聆听这个声音，稍后多半什么也记不起来；即使他们听得懂，也只能发呆，因为浑身上下几乎都没了力气。大多数时候他们只记得很高兴听见那声音，只要是他说的话都一定无比睿智、极端的有道理，他们内心的欲望逼着他们必须立刻同意，才显得自己很聪明。当其它人说话的时候，后者的声音相较起来就显得沙哑、粗鲁不堪；而如果旁人胆敢指责萨鲁曼的声音，他们心中就会不由自主产生一股怒气。对于某些人来说，这效力只有在萨鲁曼说话的时候才会持续，当他对其它人说话时，他们会露出微笑，就像人们看穿魔术师的诡计时一样。对于大部分人来说，光是听过一次那声音就足以让他们迷失自我，对于被这声音征服的人来说，不管他们走到天涯海角，那温柔的声音都会一直跟随着他们，不停地低语、不停地呢喃…没有任何人能不受到这话音的影响，只要话声的主人还能控制这声音，单单只是拒绝这声音所下的命令，就必须要极强大的意志力才能办到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But come now," said the soft voice. "Two at least of you I know by name. Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here. But you, Théoden Lord of the Mark of Rohan, are declared by your noble devices, and still more by the fair countenance of the House of Eorl. O worthy son of Thengel the Thrice-renowned! Why have you not come before, and as a friend? Much have I desired to see you, mightiest king of western lands, and especially in these latter years, to save you from the unwise and evil counsels that beset you! Is it yet too late? Despite the injuries that have been done to me, in which the men of Rohan, alas! have had some part, still I would save you, and deliver you from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably, if you ride upon this road which you have taken. Indeed I alone can aid you now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过你们毕竟都来了，”那温柔的声音说：“这其中至少有两个人我认识。我太了解甘道夫了，他绝对不会来这边寻求帮助或是解惑。但你就不同了，骠骑王希优顿，从你身上飘散的睿智风范和聪敏的外表看来，你依旧是个不辱及伊欧皇家的伟大君王。喔，伟大的赛哲尔之子啊！你为什么以前不以朋友的身份前来？我非常想要见见你，亲眼目睹这位西方最强大的君主，特别是在这几年，我更是想要将你从那邪恶的馋言和误解中解救出来！难道这已经太晚了吗？即使我已经受到了这么重的伤害，洛汗国的子民们也在其中出了不少力，但我依旧想要拯救你，让你从不可避免的灭亡末日中逃出。不要再继续执迷不悟了，只有我可以帮忙你啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They looked up, astonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming; and they saw a figure standing at the rail, looking down upon them: an old man, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred. His face was long, with a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the look that they now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary. His hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his lips and ears.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="打破这沉默的是矮人金雳，“这个巫师所说的话都是谎言！”他低吼着，边握住腰间的斧头。“在欧散克的语言中，协助代表的是破坏，救赎代表的是屠杀，任谁都看得出来，我们来这边可不是为了向你卑躬屈膝的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Théoden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked up at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and then to Gandalf at his side; and he seemed to hesitate. Gandalf made no sign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come. The Riders stirred at first, murmuring with approval of the words of Saruman; and then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. It seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord. Rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with Théoden. And over their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark in a darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside a door of escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through. There was a heavy silence.</div>

Slay whom your lord names as enemies, and be content. Meddle not in policies which you do not understand. But maybe, if you become a king, you will find that he must choose his friends with care. The friendship of Saruman and the power of Orthanc cannot be lightly thrown aside, whatever grievances, real or fancied, may lie behind. You have won a battle but not a war -- and that with help on which you cannot count again. You may find the Shadow of the Wood at your own door next: it is wayward, and senseless, and has no love for Men."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We will have peace," said Théoden at last thickly and with an effort. Several of the Riders cried out gladly. Théoden held up his hand. "Yes, we will have peace," he said, now in a clear voice, "we will have peace, when you and all your works have perished -- and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Saruman, and a corrupter of men's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the claw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! Even if your war on me was just -- as it was not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired -- even so, what will you say of your torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there? And they hewed Háma's body before the gates of the Hornburg, after he was dead. When you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I will have peace with you and Orthanc. So much for the House of Eorl. A lesser son of great sires am I, but I do not need to lick your fingers. Turn elsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm."</div>

What is the house of Eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor among the dogs? Too long have they escaped the gibbet themselves. But the noose comes, slow in the drawing, tight and hard in the end. Hang if you will!" Now his voice changed, as he slowly mastered himself. "I know not why I have had the patience to speak to you. For I need you not, nor your little band of gallopers, as swift to fly as to advance, Théoden Horsemaster. Long ago I offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit.

<div class="line_en">So great was the power that Saruman exerted in this last effort that none that stood within hearing were unmoved. But now the spell was wholly different. They heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an erring but much-loved minister. But they were shut out, listening at a door to words not meant for them: ill-mannered children or stupid servants overhearing the elusive discourse of their elders, and wondering how it would affect their lot. Of loftier mould these two were made: reverend and wise. It was inevitable that they should make alliance. Gandalf would ascend into the tower, to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of Orthanc. The door would be closed, and they would be left outside, dismissed to await allotted work or punishment. Even in the mind of Théoden the thought took shape, like a shadow of doubt: "He will betray us; he will go -- we shall be lost."</div>

I fear I am beyond your comprehension. But you, Saruman, I understand now too well. I keep a clearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than you suppose. When last I visited you, you were the jailor of Mordor, and there I was to be sent. Nay, the guest who has escaped from the roof, will think twice before he comes back in by the door. Nay, I do not think I will come up. But listen, Saruman, for the last time! Will you not come down? Isengard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it.

There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in Saruman's hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf's feet. "Go!" said Gandalf. With a cry Saruman fell back and crawled away. At that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. It glanced off the iron rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf's head, it smote the stair on which he stood. The rail rang and snapped. The stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. As it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not likely," answered Gandalf, "though they came to the balance of a hair. But I had reasons for trying; some merciful and some less so. First Saruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning. He cannot be both tyrant and counsellor. When the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret. Yet he fell into the trap, and tried to deal with his victims piece-meal, while others listened. Then I gave him a last choice and a fair one: to renounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and make amends by helping us in our need. He knows our need, none better. Great service he could have rendered. But he has chosen to withhold it, and keep the power of Orthanc. He will not serve, only command. He lives now in terror of the shadow of Mordor, and yet he still dreams of riding the storm. Unhappy fool! He will be devoured, if the power of the East stretches out its arms to Isengard. We cannot destroy Orthanc from without, but Sauron -- who knows what he can do?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确不太可能，”甘道夫回答：“但也不是完全的绝望，我有理由还是要试试看，有些是出自于同情，有些则不是。首先，萨鲁曼必须了解到他自己声音的力量已经渐渐减弱了，他不可能同时扮演暴君和顾问的角色。在计划成熟时，他就刚好掉入陷阱，试着对眼前的敌人个个击破。然后，我给了他最后一个相当公平的机会，请他舍弃魔多和自己的计划，并且借着协助我们来补偿这一切。他当然知道我们的需要，他本来可以给我们相当大的帮助，但他选择袖手旁观，选择躲在欧散克塔中，他不愿意服务，只愿意指挥。他现在只能活在魔多的恐怖阴影下，但他还梦想着可以乘势而起。真是愚蠢！如果东方的邪恶势力蔓延到艾辛格，他会被活活吞掉。我们不能够从外面摧毁欧散克塔，但谁知道萨鲁曼在里面可以做些什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I? Nothing!" said Gandalf. "I will do nothing to him. I do not wish for mastery. What will become of him? I cannot say. I grieve that so much that was good now festers in the tower. Still for us things have not gone badly. Strange are the turns of fortune! Often does hatred hurt itself! I guess that, even if we had entered in, we could have found few treasures in Orthanc more precious than the thing which Wormtongue threw down at us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我？什么也不做！”甘道夫说：“我完全不会对他怎么样，我不想要压制谁，他会怎么样呢？我也不知道，我惋惜的是有那么多好的东西被困在塔中衰败，不过，幸好对我们来说情况还不太坏。命运真是个有趣的东西！仇恨经常会反而伤到自己。即使我们真的闯进欧散克塔，恐怕也不会找到什么比巧言刚丢下来的宝物更珍贵的东西了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They returned now to the ruins of the gate. Hardly had they passed out under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood, Treebeard and a dozen other Ents came striding up. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas gazed at them in wonder.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And still is," said Legolas. "But not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees. I should dearly love to journey in Fangorn's Wood. I scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and I did not wish to turn back."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Old Ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in turn. Last he turned to Legolas. "So you have come all the way from Mirkwood, my good Elf? A very great forest it used to be!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Strange it may seem," said Legolas; "but while Gimli lives I shall not come to Fangorn alone. His axe is not for trees, but for orc-necks, O Fangorn, Master of Fangorn's Wood. Forty-two he hewed in the battle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许很少见，”勒苟拉斯说：“但只要金雳还活着，我就不愿意孤身进入法贡森林。他的斧头不是用来砍木头，而是用来砍半兽人脖子的。喔，法贡，法贡森林的主人哪，他在战场上砍了四十二名半兽人！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe I shall," said Treebeard. "But I shall miss them. We have become friends in so short a while that I think I must be getting hasty -- growing backwards towards youth, perhaps. But there, they are the first new thing under Sun or Moon that I have seen for many a long, long day. I shall not forget them. I have put their names into the Long List. Ents will remember it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“应该没什么问题啦，”树胡说：“但我会想念他们的。我们在这么短的时间就变成了朋友，几乎让我以为自己又变年轻、变仓促了。不过也不能怪我，他们可是我好多年以来第一次看到的新鲜事。我不会忘记他们的，我已经把他们的名字放进列表中，树人会记得他们的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, we must go, and go now," said Gandalf. "I fear that I must take your gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我们必须现在就走，”甘道夫说：“很遗憾必须把你们的看门人一起带走，希望没有他们你们也不会有问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you must go ere nightfall, and the Lord of the Mark is eager for his own house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呼！真不错！”树胡说：“这就好多啦！好吧好吧，事情还没发生呢，我们也不需要提早担心吧。不过，我们得要先分手了。甘道夫说你们天黑之前就要走，骠骑王也急着回家了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We will!" said Merry and Pippin together, and they turned away hastily. Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf. "So Saruman would not leave?" he said. "I did not think he would. His heart is as rotten as a black Huorn's. Still, if I were overcome and all my trees destroyed, I would not come while I had one dark hole left to hide in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们会的，”梅里和皮聘异口同声说，他们匆忙地转过身。树胡看着他们，沉默了片刻，若有所思地摇摇头。然后，他转向甘道夫说：“那么，萨鲁曼不愿意离开罗？我想他也不会，他的心地和邪恶的胡恩一样黑。不过，如果我被打败，所有的树木也都被摧毁，只要还有一个小洞可以躲藏，我也不愿意出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Gandalf. "But you have not plotted to cover all the world with your trees and choke all other living things. But there it is, Saruman remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can. He has the Key of Orthanc. But he must not be allowed to escape."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”甘道夫说：“但你又没有计划想要用大树征服全世界，奴役所有的生物。也就这样了吧，我们就让萨鲁曼在这边疗伤止痛，编织仇恨的罗网。欧散克塔的钥匙在他手中，千万别让他逃走。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Leave it to the Ents!" said Treebeard. "We shall search the valley from head to foot and peer under every pebble. Trees are coming back to live here, old trees, wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel will go here, but I shall know of it. Leave it to Ents! Until seven times the years in which he tormented us have passed, we shall not tire of watching him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都把这些交给树人吧！”树胡说：“我们会仔仔细细地搜索整座山谷，检查每颗石头，会有许多树木回来居住在这里，老树、野生的树。我们会把它们称作监视之森。就算只是一只松鼠经过我也会知道。都交给树人吧！就算过了七十年、七百年，我们也不会松懈的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed no! Ents will see to that," said Treebeard. "Saruman shall not set foot beyond the rock, without my leave. Ents will watch over him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“绝对不会！交给我们树人就好了，”树胡说：“萨鲁曼没有我同意，绝不可能踏出塔外一步，树人会好好看着他的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good!" said Gandalf. "That is what I hoped. Now I can go and turn to other matters with one care the less. But you must be wary. The waters have gone down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I do not doubt that there were deep ways delved under Orthanc, and that Saruman hopes to go and come unmarked, before long. If you will undertake the labour, I beg you to pour in the waters again; and do so, until Isengard remains a standing pool, or you discover the outlets. When all the underground places are drowned, and the outlets blocked, then Saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了！”甘道夫说：“这也正是我的希望，我可以减少一个担忧了。不过，你们必须小心。水已经退了，守卫的数量可能无法严密地看守这座塔。我认为欧散克塔底下可能有很深的隧道，萨鲁曼或许会想要利用那些隧道悄悄地离开。如果你们愿意的话，我请求你们再度将水导进来，直到艾辛格变成湖泊，或是你们找到水的流出口为止。在你们把所有的地底隧道都淹没、堵住出口之后，萨鲁曼才会愿意乖乖地躲在楼上，看着窗外的风景。”">查看中文翻译</div>
