<div class="line_en">As if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, Gandalf stirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. Then he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din: The Eagles are coming! And many voices answered crying: The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming! The hosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what this sign might mean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫彷佛突然间看见了什么预兆，他挪动身体，转过身，看着苍白、清澈的北方天空。然后，他举起手，用盖过这一切的雄浑嗓音大喊道：巨鹰来了！许多声音回应着：巨鹰来了！巨鹰来了！魔多的部队困惑地抬起头，不知这究竟是什么预兆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor, who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling Mountains when Middle-earth was young. Behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind. Straight down upon the Nazgûl they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风王关赫的确降临了！它的兄弟兰楚瓦也跟着驾到。它们是北方巨鹰中最尊贵的统治者，也是古老的索隆多子嗣中最强大的鹰王。在中土世界初诞生不久，索隆多就在围环山脉的绝顶上建造它的巢穴，是天下间最尊贵的生物之一；跟随在它们之后的是北方山脉中所有的巨鹰，乘着强风俯冲而下。它们从高空骤然出现，朝着戒灵直冲，巨大的翅膀带起了如同飓风般的波动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All about the hills the hosts of Mordor raged. The Captains of the West were foundering in a gathering sea. The sun gleamed red, and under the wings of the Nazgûl the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth. Aragorn stood beneath his banner, silent and stern, as one lost in thought of things long past or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as the night deepens. Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him. The onslaught of Mordor broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills, voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔多的部队将山丘四周包围得滴水不漏，西方将领们面对的，是一片充满了杀气和敌意的海洋，太阳发出红光，在戒灵的翅膀之下，死亡的阴影笼罩着大地。亚拉冈站在王旗旁，沉默严肃地观察着，彷佛是在观看着过去或是遥远未来的哲学家；但随着夜色渐渐落下，他的双眼也跟着暴射出精光。甘道夫站在山顶，他浑身洁白、冰冷，没有阴影可以沾染上他。魔多的部队如潮水般的掩杀而至，兵器敲击的声音震耳欲聋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet. Then rising swiftly up, far above the Towers of the Black Gate, high above the mountains, a vast soaring darkness sprang into the sky, flickering with fire. The earth groaned and quaked. The Towers of the Teeth swayed, tottered, and fell down; the mighty rampart crumbled; the Black Gate was hurled in ruin; and from far away, now dim, now growing, now mounting to the clouds, there came a drumming rumble, a roar, a long echoing roll of ruinous noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当他开口的时候，地面开始剧烈的震动，从黑门后高塔外的庭园上，冒出了浓密的黑烟，之间穿梭着炽烈的火焰。大地发出哀鸣，不停地晃动，牙之塔缓缓倾斜，轰然一声坠落下来，巨大的桥梁崩坏，黑门化成一堆废墟…从遥远的地方、从云端，不约而同地传来了万物毁灭的闷响──">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then all the Captains of the West cried aloud, for their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness. Out from the beleaguered hills knights of Gondor, Riders of Rohan, Dúnedain of the North, close-serried companies, drove against their wavering foes, piercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears. But Gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more in a clear voice:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西方众将们同时振臂高呼！在这让人窒息的黑暗中，他们心中充满了新的希望。从这被包围的山丘上，刚铎的骑士、洛汗的骠骑、北方的游侠全都携手同心的冲向敌人，锐利的长枪杀出一条血路。但就在此时，甘道夫高举双臂，再度用雄浑的声音大喊道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the Nazgûl turned and fled, and vanished into Mordor's shadows, hearing a sudden terrible call out of the Dark Tower; and even at that moment all the hosts of Mordor trembled, doubt clutched their hearts, their laughter failed, their hands shook and their limbs were loosed. The Power that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering, its will was removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a deadly light and were afraid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到邪黑塔所传出的命令后，戒灵转身就逃，消失在魔多的黑影中。就在这同一时刻，魔多的部队军心瞬间涣散，他们的心中充满疑惑，笑声跟着中断，全都陷入不知所措的困境中。原先驱赶他们，让他们心中充满仇恨、愤怒的力量动摇了，他的意志遗弃了他们；看着敌人的眼神，他们只能够看见致命的光芒，也因此感到无比的恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The realm of Sauron is ended!" said Gandalf. "The Ring-bearer has fulfilled his Quest." And as the Captains gazed south to the Land of Mordor, it seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud, there rose a huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, filling all the sky. Enormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand, terrible but impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫大喊着：“索伦的国度已经毁灭了！魔戒持有者完成了使命！”当众将一齐望向魔多的时候，他们发现从那尘云中伸出了一团巨大的、彷佛足以吞没一切的黑影，它顶端冒着眩目的电光，将整个天空完全遮蔽；庞大的身躯朝向这世界延展，伸出一只恐怖、怀着杀气的巨手，但这只是垂死的挣扎。一阵强风吹来，这一切都被吹得烟消云散，取而代之的是无比的静默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Captains bowed their heads; and when they looked up again, behold! their enemies were flying and the power of Mordor was scattering like dust in the wind. As when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits their crawling hill and holds them all in sway, ants will wander witless and purposeless and then feebly die, so the creatures of Sauron, orc or troll or beast spell-enslaved, ran hither and thither mindless; and some slew themselves, or cast themselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in holes and dark lightless places far from hope. But the Men of Rhûn and of Harad, Easterling and Southron, saw the ruin of their war and the great majesty and glory of the Captains of the West. And those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude, hating the West, and yet were men proud and bold, in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle. But the most part fled eastward as they could; and some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众将低下头，当他们再度抬起头时！看哪！所有的敌人四散奔逃，魔多的部队像是烈阳下的冰雪一样快速的融化，这些妖物如同蚁穴被捣烂的蚂蚁一般，不分东南西北的乱窜；索伦旗下的半兽人、食人妖和受到魔法控制的野兽，全都面临着同样的命运。它们如无头苍蝇般的没命狂奔，有些自相残杀，有些惨叫着跳入深渊，有些则是躲进不见天日的洞穴中。不过，原先居住在卢恩内海和哈拉德的人明白这场战斗必败无疑，也见识到了西方众将的英勇和荣光。那些投身邪恶已久的人们，虽然痛恨西方，但仍然是自傲、勇敢的战士，他们集结兵力，决定奋战到底。不过，大部分的士兵还是往东奔逃，有些则是丢盔弃甲，向眼前的敌人投降。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very well, Sam. If you wish to go, I'll come," said Frodo; and they rose and went slowly down the winding road; and even as they passed towards the Mountain's quaking feet, a great smoke and steam belched from the Sammath Naur, and the side of the cone was riven open, and a huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，山姆，如果你想走，我就跟你一起走。”佛罗多说。两人沿着蜿蜒的小径一路往下走。正当他们朝着山脚前进时，火焰之厅冒出了大团浓烟和蒸汽，山的那一侧整个被炸开，大量的岩浆沿着东坡流淌而下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo and Sam could go no further. Their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebbing. They had reached a low ashen hill piled at the Mountain's foot; but from it there was no more escape. It was an island now, not long to endure, amid the torment of Orodruin. All about it the earth gaped, and from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up. Behind them the Mountain was convulsed. Great rents opened in its side. Slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them. Soon they would be engulfed. A rain of hot ash was falling.</div>

<div class="line_en">They stood now; and Sam still holding his master's hand caressed it. He sighed. "What a tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo, haven't we?" he said. "I wish I could hear it told! Do you think they'll say: Now comes the story of Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom? And then everyone will hush, like we did, when in Rivendell they told us the tale of Beren One-hand and the Great Jewel. I wish I could hear it! And I wonder how it will go on after our part."</div>

<div class="line_en">But even while he spoke so, to keep fear away until the very last, his eyes still strayed north, north into the eye of the wind, to where the sky far off was clear, as the cold blast, rising to a gale, drove back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds.</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered that smell: the fragrance of Ithilien. "Bless me!" he mused. "How long have I been asleep?" For the scent had borne him back to the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank; and for the moment all else between was out of waking memory. He stretched and drew a deep breath. "Why, what a dream I've had!" he muttered. "I am glad to wake!" He sat up and then he saw that Frodo was lying beside him, and slept peacefully, one hand behind his head, and the other resting upon the coverlet.

<div class="line_en">"A great Shadow has departed," said Gandalf, and then he laughed, and the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he listened the thought came to Sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure sound of merriment, for days upon days without count. It fell upon his ears like the echo of all the joys he had ever known. But he himself burst into tears.

<div class="line_en">Then the others also departed, and Frodo and Sam went to their beds and slept. And in the morning they rose again in hope and peace; and they spent many days in Ithilien. For the Field of Cormallen, where the host was now encamped, was near to Henneth Annûn, and the stream that flowed from its falls could be heard in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate, and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of Anduin by the Isle of Cair Andros. The hobbits wandered here and there visiting again the places that they had passed before; and Sam hoped always in some shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch, maybe, a glimpse of the great Oliphaunt. And when he learned that at the siege of Gondor there had been a great number of these beasts but that they were all destroyed, he thought it a sad loss.</div>

<div class="line_en">But at the last when the month of May was drawing near the Captains of the West set out again; and they went aboard ship with all their men, and they sailed from Cair Andros down Anduin to Osgiliath; and there they remained for one day; and the day after they came to the green fields of the Pelennor and saw again the white towers under tall Mindolluin, the City of the Men of Gondor, last memory of Westernesse, that had passed through the darkness and fire to a new day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，当五月渐渐逼近的时候，西方的众将领又再度出发了。他们搭着船，带着所有的部下沿河而下，来到奥斯吉力亚斯。他们在那边停留了一天，第二天就来到了帕兰诺平原，再度看见那明都陆安山下洁白的高塔，也是刚铎的王城，西方皇族最后的遗迹。米那斯提力斯穿越劫火，即将迎接新的时代。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to Minas Tirith. The weary rested and the hurt were healed. For some had laboured and fought much with the remnants of the Easterlings and Southrons, until all were subdued. And, latest of all, those returned who had passed into Mordor and destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land.</div>
