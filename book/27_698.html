<div class="line_en">A white tent had been set up on basketball courts next to the old Facebook building, which the company was in the process of vacating. Music was blaring from big outdoor speakers and lights projected images of giant pink spiders onto the makeshift dance floor. The grass field behind the tent was decorated with pumpkins and bales of hay. As he breathed in the cooling evening air of Palo Alto's Indian summer, Alan scanned the costumed crowd and caught sight of Elizabeth. She was wearing a long velvet dress with gold trim and a big upright collar, and her blond hair was done up in an elaborate bun. The irony of her Queen Elizabeth attire wasn't lost on him. With a net worth that Forbes had just estimated at $4.5 billion in its October 20, 2014, issue, she had become Silicon Valley royalty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alan was supposed to be a zombie and he felt like one. In retrospect, leaving his tranquil post in Pittsburgh to come work at Theranos had been like crossing into his own strange version of the Twilight Zone. For his first few months as laboratory director, he'd clung to the belief that the company was going to transform lab testing with its technology. But the past year's events had shattered any illusion of that. He now felt like a pawn in a dangerous game being played with patients, investors, and regulators. At one point, he'd had to talk Sunny and Elizabeth out of running HIV tests on diluted finger-stick samples. Unreliable potassium and cholesterol results were bad enough. False HIV results would have been disastrous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾伦应该扮成僵尸的，他觉得自己不必扮就是。回想起来，离开匹兹堡安稳的工作来到Theranos，就像是跨入自己版本的诡异《阴阳魔界》（Twilight Zone）。出任实验室主任的前几个月，他还坚信这家公司会用其新技术翻转实验室检验，然而去年发生的种种粉碎了他的错觉，现在他觉得自己是一场危险棋局的棋子，而下棋的人是病人、投资人、主管机关。有一度，他得力阻桑尼和伊莉莎白用稀释过的手指血液样本做HIV检验，不可靠的钾和胆固醇检测结果已经够糟了，错误的HIV检验结果会带来灾难。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ordinarily stiff and aloof at the office, Elizabeth liked to let loose on these occasions. At last year's party, she'd jumped up and down in a bouncy house like an excited child. This year, the bouncy house was replaced by an inflatable boxing ring. While employees wearing sumo suits and oversized boxing gloves wobbled around in it, Elizabeth was delighting in the costume of an engineer disguised as a giant neutrophil.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alan was reaching his own breaking point. A few weeks earlier, he'd started forwarding dozens of work emails to his personal Gmail account. He knew forwarding the emails was a risky move because the company monitored everything, but he wanted to keep a record of the concerns he'd repeatedly raised with Sunny and Elizabeth. He'd gone a step further two days earlier and called a law firm in Washington, D. C., that specialized in representing corporate whistleblowers, but the person who answered the phone was a "client services specialist." He opted to keep the reason for his call vague, wanting to speak only to an attorney. He did send them one of his email exchanges with Sunny, but he worried it was hard to understand without additional context and a good understanding of how clinical laboratories operate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾伦也濒临自己的引爆点。几个星期前，他开始把数十封工作上的电邮转寄到自己的Gmail信箱，他知道转寄这些信是很冒险的举动，因为这家公司无所不监控，但是他想留下纪录，证明自己已经一再将这些顾虑向桑尼和伊莉莎白提起。两天前他甚至采取更进一步的行动，打电话给华盛顿特区一家律师事务所，那家事务所专门代表企业内部的吹哨者（whistleblower，又称告密者；译按：揭发企业或政府部门内部违法事实的人），但是接电话的人是「客户服务专员」，他只想跟律师谈，于是把去电缘由讲得含糊不清。他把一封他和桑尼往来的电邮寄给他们，不过他担心，缺乏上下文脉络再加上对临床实验室的运作不是很懂的话，很难理解信件内容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His codirector, Mark Pandori, had quit after just five months on the job. The trigger had been a request he'd made that Elizabeth check in with them before making representations to the press about Theranos's testing capabilities. Sunny had summarily rejected it, prompting Mark to hand in his resignation that very day. Another member of the lab had been so troubled by some of the company's practices that she told Alan she couldn't sleep at night. She too had resigned.</div>

How could a lab director, the person who was supposed to vouch for the accuracy of the test results delivered to doctors and patients, be denied that information? His other big concern was proficiency testing. After reading up on the CLIA regulations, he'd become convinced that Theranos was gaming the exercise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Daniel Young had sidled up next to him, interrupting his somber thoughts. As was his habit at these work parties, Daniel was drunk. The alcohol made him uncharacteristically friendly and approachable, but Alan knew better than to share his misgivings. Daniel was part of the inner circle. They made small talk, bantering about Daniel's upper-crust upbringing in Connecticut. As they chatted, the festivities seemed to be winding down. Some colleagues were headed to Antonio's Nut House, a dive bar a few blocks down the street, to have a few more beers. Alan and Daniel tagged along.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they got to the bar, Alan spotted Curtis Schneider, a scientist on the R&amp;D side of the company, and grabbed a stool beside him. Curtis was one of the smartest people Alan knew at Theranos. He had a Ph. D. in inorganic chemistry and had spent four years as a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech. They talked about fly fishing for a while. It was one of Curtis's favorite hobbies. Then Curtis told Alan about a conference call earlier that day with officials from the FDA. Theranos was trying to get the agency to approve some of its proprietary blood tests. During the call, one of the agency's reviewers voiced a dissenting view about the company's submission but was silenced by his colleagues. Curtis found it odd. There might be nothing to it, Alan thought, but the story added to his mounting unease. He told Curtis about the lab's quality-control data and how it was being kept from him. And he confided something else: the company was cheating on proficiency testing. In case Curtis hadn't registered the implication of what he'd just said, he spelled it out: Theranos was breaking the law.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three weeks later, Alan was sitting in his new office in Newark when he got a call from Christian Holmes. Most of the company had moved to the new building on Page Mill Road in Palo Alto, but not the clinical laboratory. The lab had moved across San Francisco Bay to Theranos's sprawling Newark facility, where it planned to one day manufacture thousands of miniLabs.</div>

Elizabeth replied that she was deeply disappointed. He agreed to delay his official departure by another month to give Theranos time to find a new lab director. For the first two weeks of his notice period, Alan went on vacation. He rode his motorcycle to Los Angeles to see his brother for a few days and then flew to New York to spend Thanksgiving with his parents. When he returned in mid-December, he headed to the new Palo Alto headquarters to discuss a transition plan with Sunny.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuisz too had become doubtful that Theranos could really do what it claimed. During a visit to Palo Alto for pretrial motions in the fall of 2013, he'd called the local Walgreens and asked if he could have a creatinine finger-stick test done there. His doctors had recently diagnosed him with aldosteronism, a hormonal disorder that causes high blood pressure, and wanted him to monitor his creatinine levels for any sign of kidney damage. Creatinine is a common blood test, but the woman who answered the phone told him the wellness center didn't offer it without a special approval from Theranos's CEO. When he added that to the company's intense secrecy and to the fact that it had actively discouraged Ian Gibbons from testifying before he died, he smelled a rat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹也愈来愈怀疑，Theranos真的有做到它所宣称的一切。二〇一三年秋天，他为开庭审讯前的动议（pretrial motion）前往帕罗奥图，他打电话到当地的沃尔格林，询问是否可以做肌酸酐（creatinine）的扎手指检测。他的医生刚诊断出他罹患多醛固酮症（aldosteronism），那是一种荷尔蒙失调会导致高血压，医生要他监控肌酸酐含量，以便追踪肾脏是否有受损迹象。肌酸酐是很常见的血液检验，但电话那头的女子告诉他，那家健康中心没有Theranos首席执行官特别批准不能提供这项检测。傅伊兹把这件事跟Theranos极度保密的情况串连起来，还有Theranos在伊恩．吉本斯过世前，极力劝阻他出庭作证，这些种种加起来，傅伊兹嗅出事有蹊跷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The decade-old episode had left Phyllis skeptical that Elizabeth, who had no medical or scientific training to speak of and a clear tendency not to listen to people who were older and more experienced, had really gone on to develop groundbreaking blood-testing technology. Her suspicions had deepened when Andrew had chatted with a Siemens sales representative during a flight and learned that Theranos was a major purchaser of Siemens diagnostic equipment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为有这段十年前的陈年插曲，菲丽丝很怀疑，伊莉莎白并没有什么值得称道的医学或科学训练，显然也听不进比她年长、比她有经验的人劝告，这样的她，真的有办法开发出开创性的血液检验技术吗？她的怀疑在安竹跟西门子一位业务代表聊过后更加深了，那是在一趟飞机航程上，安竹从那位业务代表口中得知，Theranos是西门子诊断仪器的大宗采购者。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That would change when, in its December 15, 2014, issue, The New Yorker published a profile of Elizabeth. In many ways, it was just a longer version of the Fortune story that had rocketed her to fame six months earlier. The difference this time was that someone knowledgeable about blood testing read it and was immediately dubious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到二〇一四年十二月十五日《纽约客》（The New Yorker）刊出伊莉莎白特写报导，情况开始有了改变。从很多角度来看，那篇报导只是《财星》半年前那篇使伊莉莎白声名大噪文章的加长版，唯一的差别在于，这次有位血液检测专家看到报导，并且立刻产生怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fuisz had introduced Phyllis to Ian's widow, Rochelle, and the two women had bonded over their distrust of Elizabeth. Together, the three of them formed a little band of Theranos skeptics. The problem was that no one else seemed to share their doubts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹把菲丽丝介绍给伊恩的遗孀罗雪儿，这两位女性很快就因为都不信任伊莉莎白而一拍即合，三个人于是形成一个小小的「Theranos怀疑者联盟」。问题是，似乎没有其他人跟他们有着一样的怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That someone was Adam Clapper, a practicing pathologist in Columbia, Missouri, who in his spare time wrote a blog about the industry called Pathology Blawg. To Clapper, it all sounded too good to be true, especially Theranos's supposed ability to run dozens of tests on just a drop of blood pricked from a finger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个专家是亚当．克雷伯（Adam Clapper），密苏里州哥伦比亚执业病理医师，闲暇之余撰写一个博客，称为「病理法律博客」（Pathology Blawg），讲述病理学产业。在克雷伯看来，杂志内容好到不像真的，尤其是Theranos宣称仅凭手指一滴血就能做数十种检测。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The New Yorker article did strike some skeptical notes. It included quotes from a senior scientist at Quest who said he didn't think finger-stick blood tests could be reliable, and it noted Theranos's lack of published, peer-reviewed data. Among the arguments she marshaled to rebut the latter point, Elizabeth cited a paper she had coauthored in a medical journal called Hematology Reports. Clapper had never heard of Hematology Reports before, so he looked into it. He learned that it was an online-only publication based in Italy that charged scientists who wanted to publish in it a five-hundred-dollar fee. He then looked up the paper Holmes had coauthored and was shocked to see that it included data for just one blood test from a grand total of six patients.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《纽约客》那篇文章确实有提出几个质疑。内文引述了奎斯特诊断公司资深科学家的说法，那位科学家说他不认为扎手指血液检测可信赖，此外文章也提到，Theranos缺乏已公开发表的同侪审查（peer review，编按：由具有同类学科背景的同侪进行评核）数据。对于后者，伊莉莎白以一篇她列名共同作者的论文来反驳，那篇论文发表于一份叫做《血液学报告》（Hematology Reports）的医学期刊。克雷伯从未听过《血液学报告》，好奇查了一下，才知道那是一份只发行于网络上的意大利刊物，想在上面发表论文的科学家必须缴交五百美元的费用。然后，他找出霍姆斯共同执笔的那篇论文，惊讶地发现里面只有一种血液检验的数据，接受检测的病人全部加起来也只有六个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While checking his emails a few days later, Fuisz saw a notification from LinkedIn alerting him that someone new had looked up his profile on the site. The viewer's name -- Alan Beam -- didn't ring a bell but his job title got Fuisz's attention: laboratory director at Theranos. Fuisz sent Beam a message through the site's InMail feature asking if they could talk on the phone. He thought the odds of getting a response were very low, but it was worth a try. He was in Malibu taking photos with his old Leica camera the next day when a short reply from Beam appeared in his iPhone in-box. He was willing to talk and he included his cell-phone number. Fuisz drove his black Mercedes E-Class sedan back to Beverly Hills and, when he was just a few blocks from home, dialed the number.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后傅伊兹查看电子邮件时，发现领英发了一则通知，提醒他有个人查看他在领英网站上的个人数据，那个人的名字是艾伦．毕姆。傅伊兹对这个名字没有印象，但他的工作职称引起了傅伊兹的注意：Theranos实验室主任。傅伊兹透过领英网站的内部邮件，寄了封消息给毕姆，询问是否可以透过电话相谈，他以为得到回应的机率很低，不过还是值得试试。第二天，人在加州马里布（Malibu）的傅伊兹，拿着徕卡相机在拍照，iPhone收件匣出现一封来自毕姆的简短回信，他很愿意谈谈，还附上他的手机号码。傅伊兹立刻开着他的黑色奔驰E-Class回到比佛利山，离家还有几个街区就迫不及待拨了那个号码。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a post on his blog about the New Yorker story, Clapper pointed out the medical journal's obscurity and the flimsiness of the study and declared himself a skeptic "until I see evidence Theranos can deliver what it says it can deliver in terms of diagnostic accuracy." Pathology Blawg didn't exactly have a big readership, but Joe Fuisz came across the post in a Google search and brought it to his father's attention. Richard Fuisz immediately got in touch with Clapper and told him he was onto something. He put him in contact with Phyllis and Rochelle and urged him to listen to what they had to say. Clapper was intrigued by what the three of them told him, especially by the story of Ian Gibbons's death. But it all sounded too circumstantial to go beyond what he'd already written. What he needed was some sort of proof, he told Fuisz.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clapper agreed that this changed everything. The story now had legs. But he decided he couldn't take it on himself. For one thing, he couldn't shoulder the legal liability of going up against a $9 billion Silicon Valley company with a litigious track record that was represented by David Boies. For another, he was just an amateur blogger. He didn't have the journalistic know-how to tackle something like this. Not to mention the fact that he had a full-time medical practice to tend to. This, he thought, was a job for an investigative reporter. In the three years since he'd launched Pathology Blawg, Clapper had spoken to several about lab-industry abuses. There was one in particular who came to mind. He worked for the Wall Street Journal.</div>
