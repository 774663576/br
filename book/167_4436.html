<div class="line_en">Samwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall. The glow came from the lamp hung over his head. He looked up at the sound of Jon's steps. "Have you been here all night?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You didn't break your fast with us, and your bed hadn't been slept in." Rast suggested that maybe Sam had deserted, but Jon never believed it. Desertion required its own sort of courage, and Sam had little enough of that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The air smelled of paper and dust and years. Before him, tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness, crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls. A faint yellow glow filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp. Jon blew out the taper he carried, preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper. Instead he followed the light, wending his way down the narrow aisles beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings. All in black, he was a shadow among shadows, dark of hair, long of face, grey of eye. Black moleskin gloves covered his hands; the right because it was burned, the left because a man felt half a fool wearing only one glove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气里弥漫着陈年积灰和腐朽纸张的味道。在他面前是一座座高大的木书架，顶端没入黑暗，架上堆满了皮面装订的书册，以及一箱一箱的古老卷轴。在房间某处有一盏油灯，微弱的黄光从书堆中渗透出来。这里到处都是老旧纸张，为避免引火，琼恩吹熄了手中蜡烛，跟随灯光，在拱形天花板下的狭窄过道里穿梭。他一身黑衣、一头黑发、一张长脸，一双灰眼，彷佛是黑暗中的阴影。他连双手都戴着黑色鼹鼠皮手套：右手是因为灼伤未愈，左手则是因为手套戴一边显得很可笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes." Sam's hand swept over the table, fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before him. "A dozen, at the least." He unfolded a square of parchment. "The paint has faded, but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages, and there's another book… where is it now? I was reading it a moment ago." He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather. "This," he said reverently, "is the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower all the way to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore, written by a ranger named Redwyn. It's not dated, but he mentions a Dorren Stark as King in the North, so it must be from before the Conquest. Jon, they fought giants! Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest, it's all here." Ever so delicately, he turned pages with a finger. "He drew maps as well, see…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有啊有啊，”山姆挥舞他肥如香肠的手指，指着面前桌上散乱的书籍和卷轴。“起码有十几种。”他展开一张羊皮纸，“这上面的墨水虽然已经褪色，但你还是可以看出绘图者标示的野人聚落，还有一本书…我放哪儿了？刚刚还在读。”他推开几张卷轴，找出一本积满灰尘，封皮腐烂的书。“就是这本，”他语带虔敬地说，“是一个姓雷德温的游骑兵写的，讲述的是他从影子塔一路到冰封海岸的凄凉岬的旅行经过。上面虽然没有日期，但他提到北境之王多伦·史塔克，所以这一定是在征服战争以前完成的。琼恩，他们和巨人作战呢！雷德温甚至和森林之子有过贸易往来，这些全记在书里面。”他小心翼翼地用一根手指翻页，“你看，他画了地图…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He'd meant to sound encouraging, but it was the wrong thing to say. The last thing Sam needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow. He shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly. "There's more maps. If I had time to search… everything's a jumble. I could set it all to order, though; I know I could, but it would take time… well, years, in truth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他本意是鼓励，却说错了话，山姆此刻最不需要别人提醒的就是从明天起他们将面对的命运。他随手翻动一些卷轴，“地图还很多，如果给我时间…这里乱成一团，不过我有办法把一切都整理妥当，我知道我能行，但那得花上好多时间…唉，说真的，起码要好些年才行。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that." Jon plucked a scroll from a bin, blew off the worst of the dust. A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it. "Look, this one is crumbling," he said, frowning over the faded script.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕莫尔蒙没法等那么久，”琼恩从箱子里抽出一束卷轴，吹掉上面厚厚的灰尘，不料展开的时候，卷轴竟有一小角从他指间剥落。“你看，这张快碎了。”他看着褪色的字迹皱眉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Be gentle." Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand, holding it as if it were a wounded animal. "The important books used to be copied over when they needed them. Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我就会，”山姆小心翼翼地把卷轴放回原本的箱子，“从帐目里，你可以学到很多，真的，我不骗你。比方说，你可以从中得知当时守夜人军团有多少人，过着什么样的生活，吃些什么东西…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do," the fat boy blurted. He was older than Jon, a man grown by law, but it was hard to think of him as anything but a boy. "I found drawings of the faces in the trees, and a book about the tongue of the children of the forest… works that even the Citadel doesn't have, scrolls from old Valyria, counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years…"</div>

<div class="line_en">The gods play cruel jests, Jon thought. Pyp and Toad, all a lather to be a part of the great ranging, were to remain at Castle Black. It was Samwell Tarly, the self-proclaimed coward, grossly fat, timid, and near as bad a rider as he was with a sword, who must face the haunted forest. The Old Bear was taking two cages of ravens, so they might send back word as they went. Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them, so his steward must go in his place. "We need you for the ravens, Sam. And someone has to help me keep Grenn humble."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诸神对人的种种残酷捉弄，莫不以此为甚，琼恩不禁想。迫不及待想参加这次长征的派普和陶德必须留守黑城堡，需要面对鬼影森林的，却是山姆威尔·塔利。他是个自承懦弱的的人，肥胖无比，胆子奇小，骑马舞剑样样不行。可熊老打算随军携带两笼信鸦，以便沿途将讯息送回城堡，而伊蒙学士双眼已盲，身子又太过孱弱，无法与他们同行，只好由他的事务官代替。“山姆，我们需要你照顾信鸦，我自己也需要你帮忙照着葛兰，确保他小心一点。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam nodded unhappily. The shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single file as they left. The vault opened onto one of the tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks, winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and towers of Castle Black under the earth. In summer the wormwalks were seldom used, save by rats and other vermin, but winter was a different matter. When the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the ice winds came howling out of the north, the tunnels were all that held Castle Black together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆怏怏不乐地点点头。书架摆放得非常紧密，彼此间隔很窄，仅容一人通行。走出地窖，便来到弟兄们称为“虫道”的隧道，蜿蜒曲折的虫道位于地下，连接着黑城堡的堡垒和塔楼。夏日之际，除了老鼠横行，鲜少有人使用虫道，可到冬天就大不一样。当积雪深达五十尺，夹杂冰霜的北风呼啸而至时，联系黑城堡各处的唯有这些通道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A brother of the Night's Watch shouldn't be so scared."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“守夜人不该害怕，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're all scared. We'd be fools if we weren't." Too many rangers had been lost the past two years, even Benjen Stark, Jon's uncle. They had found two of his uncle's men in the wood, slain, but the corpses had risen in the chill of night. Jon's burnt fingers twitched as he remembered. He still saw the wight in his dreams, dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands, but that was the last thing Sam needed to be reminded of. "There's no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it. Come, I'll help you gather up the maps."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们谁不害怕呢？要有人不怕，那他一定是傻子。”过去这两年来，已经有太多游骑兵下落不明，其中也包括琼恩的叔叔班扬·史塔克。他们在森林里找到叔叔的两名手下，均惨遭杀害，尸首更在寒夜中死而复生。琼恩一想起这事，灼伤的手指便不由自主地抽搐起来。至今他依旧会在梦中看到尸鬼奥瑟，那双燃烧的蓝眼和黑冷的双手，但这些可不能对山姆提起。“我父亲对我说过，不必为恐惧而羞耻，重要的是如何去面对。走吧，我帮你拿地图。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon, Jon thought as they climbed. He'd seen the harbinger that had come to Maester Aemon with word of summer's end, the great raven of the Citadel, white and silent as Ghost. He had seen a winter once, when he was very young, but everyone agreed that it had been a short one, and mild. This one would be different. He could feel it in his bones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那样的日子就快到了吧，他们爬出地窖，琼恩一边想。他已经在伊蒙学士那儿亲眼目睹了报告夏日终结的使节——一只来自学城，通体雪白，和白灵一样沉静的信鸦。他在童年时代，曾经见识过冬天的景象，不过大家都说那个冬天既非苦寒，更不漫长。这次可不一样，他打骨子里感觉得到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith's bellows by the time they reached the surface. They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon's cloak swirl and snap. Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary, but he woke when Jon appeared, bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他们登上级级陡峭石梯，走回地面，山姆已经像铁匠的风箱一样气喘吁吁。迎面一阵劲风，吹得琼恩的斗篷劈啪作响。白灵趴在谷仓的篱笆墙下睡觉，当琼恩走近，它便一跃而起，跟在他们身后，毛茸茸的白尾巴竖得笔直。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam squinted up at the Wall. It loomed above them, an icy cliff seven hundred feet high. Sometimes it seemed to Jon almost a living thing, with moods of its own. The color of the ice was wont to change with every shift of the light. Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers, now the dirty white of old snow, and when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone. The Wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see, so huge that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance. It was the end of the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆眯眼朝长城望去。城墙巍然耸立，俨然如一座七百尺的冰封绝壁。琼恩时而觉得长城似有生命，自有其心绪变换。冰壁的颜色随着光线移动而改变，有时是河流冻结的深蓝，有时是堆积陈雪的污白，若有流云蔽日，则又黯淡下来，成了凹凸山石的浅灰。长城向东西两面延伸，直至视线尽头，其庞然之势，使得墙下的木造堡垒和石砌塔楼都显得微不足道。它，就是世界的尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they passed the sept, he heard voices raised in song. Some men want whores on the eve of battle, and some want gods. Jon wondered who felt better afterward. The sept tempted him no more than the brothel; his own gods kept their temples in the wild places, where the weirwoods spread their bone-white branches. The Seven have no power beyond the Wall, he thought, but my gods will be waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过圣堂时，他听见里面传来高声吟唱的圣歌。战争来临的前夕，有人想干妓女，有人想求神灵，琼恩不知道嗣后哪边会比较满意，只是圣堂和妓院一样对他没有吸引力。他所信仰的诸神以荒野为宗庙，那里的鱼梁木伸展着苍白如骨的枝干。七神在长城外没有力量，他心想，但我的神却等着我呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ghost loped ahead of them. The grounds seemed deserted this morning, with so many rangers off at the brothel in Mole's Town, digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves blind. Grenn had gone with them. Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman to celebrate his first ranging. They'd wanted Jon and Sam to come as well, but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no part of it.

<div class="line_en">Outside the armory, Ser Endrew Tarth was working with some raw recruits. They'd come in last night with Conwy, one of the wandering crows who roamed the Seven Kingdoms collecting men for the Wall. This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff, two blond boys with the look of brothers, a foppish youth in soiled satin, a raggy man with a clubfoot, and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior.

<div class="line_en">Mormont continued. "Aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles, the heir apparent, was slain in a tourney mishap. He left two sons, but they followed him to the grave not long after, during the Great Spring Sickness. King Daeron was also taken, so the crown passed to Daeron's second son, Aerys."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫尔蒙续道：“当伊蒙的大伯，也就是王位继承人，在一次比武大会上意外身亡时，他还在埋首书堆呢。他大伯本有两名子嗣，可没过多久便相继死于春季大瘟疫。戴伦国王也同时染病去世，因此王位传给了戴伦的次子伊里斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Mad King?" Jon was confused. Aerys had been king before Robert, that wasn't so long ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘疯王’伊里斯？”琼恩糊涂了，伊里斯是劳勃之前的国王，距今应该没这么久啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How long ago was this?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Eighty years or close enough," the Old Bear said, "and no, I still hadn't been born, though Aemon had forged half a dozen links of his maester's chain by then. Aerys wed his own sister, as the Targaryens were wont to do, and reigned for ten or twelve years. Aemon took his vows and left the Citadel to serve at some lordling's court… until his royal uncle died without issue. The Iron Throne passed to the last of King Daeron's four sons. That was Maekar, Aemon's father. The new king summoned all his sons to court and would have made Aemon part of his councils, but he refused, saying that would usurp the place rightly belonging to the Grand Maester. Instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother, another Daeron. Well, that one died too, leaving only a feeble-witted daughter as heir. Some pox he caught from a whore, I believe. The next brother was Aerion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看总有八十年了吧，”熊老道，“说不确切，当时连我都还没出生，伊蒙却已造好了大半颈链。伊里斯依照坦格利安家的传统，娶了妹妹为妻，之后又统治了十多年。伊蒙则宣誓成为学士，随后离开学城，去为某个贵族服务…直到他的伯父过世，且未留下子嗣。铁王座由是传给了戴伦国王最后一个儿子，即伊蒙的父亲梅卡。新王将儿子们通通召回宫中，他本打算让伊蒙担任重臣，可伊蒙不愿篡取理当属于大学士的地位，因而拒绝了。他去了长兄的城堡，选择为他服务，那一位也叫戴伦。可是呢，这个戴伦不久也没了命，身后只留有一个弱智的女儿。如果我没记错，他好像是逛妓院染了梅毒。王国接下来的继承人是次子伊利昂。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame. One night, in his cups, he drank a jar of wildfire, after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon, but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse. Not quite a year after, King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是，不过他称自己为‘明焰’伊利昂。某天晚上，他喝过了头，居然灌下一罐野火，并对朋友夸口说野火可以使他成龙，所幸诸神有眼，只让他成为死尸一具。他死后不到一年，梅卡国王也在对抗盗匪头目的战事中阵亡。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aerion the Monstrous?" Jon knew that name. "The Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon" was one of Old Nan's more gruesome tales. His little brother Bran had loved it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘魔鬼’伊利昂？”琼恩知道这个人，“自以为成龙的王子”是老奶妈的故事里特别恐怖的一个，小弟布兰最爱听了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes and no. First they offered it, quietly, to Aemon. And quietly he refused. The gods meant for him to serve, not to rule, he told them. He had sworn a vow and would not break it, though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him. Well, no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion's on the throne, and Daeron's girl was a lackwit besides being female, so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon's younger brother -- Aegon, the Fifth of His Name. Aegon the Unlikely, they called him, born the fourth son of a fourth son. Aemon knew, and rightly, that if he remained at court those who disliked his brother's rule would seek to use him, so he came to the Wall. And here he has remained, while his brother and his brother's son and his son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the Dragonkings."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你只说对了一半。他们本将王冠悄悄地献给伊蒙，却也被他悄悄地拒绝了。他告诉他们：诸神托付给他的使命是服侍，而非统治，他发下誓言，就决不背弃，纵然总主教愿意赦免他也不行。嗳，只要头脑健全的人都不愿让伊利昂的后代坐上王位，而戴伦的女儿不仅低能，更非男性，最后不得已，只好改立伊蒙的弟弟为王——这就是伊耿五世，老王的四子的四子，他们叫他”不该成王的王“。伊蒙深知自己倘若继续留在朝中，难免被反对伊耿的人士利用，于是他来到长城，再未离去，而让他的弟弟，他的侄子，他的侄孙一个接一个统治国事，复又死去，直到詹姆·兰尼斯特结束了龙之国王一族的血脉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm; his own maester had seen to that. "That was the year of the Great Council," he said. "The lords passed over Prince Aerion's infant son and Prince Daeron's daughter and gave the crown to Aegon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩对王国历史并非一无所知，这都要拜鲁温学士所赐。“那一年召开过大议会。”他插话，“全国诸侯决定放弃伊利昂王子年幼的儿子和戴伦王子的女儿，而把王冠交给伊耿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mormont gave a whistle, and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm. "A lord's one thing, a king's another." He offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket. "They will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and die in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You'll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow. Him they'll call Your Grace. Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go unsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon… and I'll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it."</div>
