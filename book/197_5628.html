<div class="line_en">Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有一个阴谋，哈利波特。今年霍格沃茨魔法学校会有恐怖的事情发生。”多比压低声音说，突然浑身发抖，“多比知道这件事已经有几个月了，先生。哈利波特不能去冒险。他太重要了，先生！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no, no," squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. "Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger."</div>
