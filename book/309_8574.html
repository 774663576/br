<div class="line_en">Jesse Owens had just completed the 4 x 100m relay and won his fourth gold medal. Talk that he was subhuman because he was black and Hitler's refusal to shake his hand were touted around the world. Even the most racist Germans were amazed with the efforts of Owens, and word of his feat slipped through the cracks. No one was more impressed than Rudy Steiner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone in his family was crowded together in their family room when he slipped out and made his way to the kitchen. He pulled some charcoal from the stove and gripped it in the smallness of his hands. "Now." There was a smile. He was ready.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we both know, Liesel wasn't on hand on Himmel Street when Rudy performed his act of childhood infamy. When she looked back, though, it felt like she'd actually been there. In her memory, she had somehow become a member of Rudy's imaginary audience. Nobody else mentioned it, but Rudy certainly made up for that, so much that when Liesel came to recollect her story, the Jesse Owens incident was as much a part of it as everything she witnessed firsthand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在莉泽尔的记忆里，她仿佛真的见过鲁迪小时候那桩令他臭名远扬的事件。不知怎么回事，她似乎总能看见鲁迪想象中的围观人群，并在其中找到自己。也许她只是喜欢想象那个场面：草地上，一个全身涂成黑色的男孩飞驰而过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the window, the boy grinned almost maniacally at his reflection, and in his shorts and tank top, he quietly abducted his older brother's bike and pedaled it up the street, heading for Hubert Oval. In one of his pockets, he'd hidden a few pieces of extra charcoal, in case some of it wore off later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩看着自己映在窗玻璃上的影子，近乎疯狂地笑了起来。他穿着短裤和背心，偷了哥哥的自行车，蹬上它向休贝特体育场骑去。他口袋里还藏着几块炭，免得身上的颜色脱落。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rusty bike crumbled to a halt at the Hubert Oval fence line and Rudy climbed over. He landed on the other side and trotted weedily up toward the beginning of the hundred.

<div class="line_cn" title="发令员示意他们站到起跑线上。休贝特体育场跑道两旁出现了密密麻麻的观众。他们异口同声地呼喊，高叫着他的名字，而他的名字是杰西·欧文斯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Steiner was a remarkably polite man under normal circumstances. Discovering one of his children smeared charcoal black on a summer evening was not what he considered normal circumstances. "The boy is crazy," he muttered, although he conceded that with six kids, something like this was bound to happen. At least one of them had to be a bad egg. Right now, he was looking at it, waiting for an explanation. "Well?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通常情况下，施泰纳先生是一个彬彬有礼的人。但在这个夏日的傍晚，发现自己的儿子全身涂成了炭黑色，这可不是什么通常情况。“这小子疯了。”他低声抱怨道。不过他承认，他一共生了六个孩子，这样的事情总是会发生的，里面总有一个会不太对劲。此时此刻，他盯着鲁迪，等着听他的解释。“怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was ist los?" he said to his son when he showed up in all his charcoal glory. "What the hell is going on here?" The crowd vanished. A breeze sprang up. "I was asleep in my chair when Kurt noticed you were gone. Everyone's out looking for you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Rudy panted, bending down and placing his hands on his knees. "I was being Jesse Owens." He answered as though it was the most natural thing on earth to be doing. There was even something implicit in his tone that suggested something along the lines of, "What the hell does it look like?" The tone vanished, however, when he saw the sleep deprivation whittled under his father's eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁迪弯着腰，双手撑在膝盖上，嘴里喘着粗气。“我在扮演杰西·欧文斯。”他的回答让人觉得这是世上最理所应当的事，口吻中似乎有一种扬扬自得。“看起来是不是帅呆了？”可是当他注意到父亲的惺忪睡眼时，这种感觉立刻消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
