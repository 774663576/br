<div class="line_cn" title="他抬起眼睛，透过刘海望着她，说：“我还以为上次你继父那件事后，他们会禁止你用电话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because," he said quietly. They said everything quietly, even though everyone else on the bus roared, even though you'd have to shout into a megaphone to be heard over all the cursing and idiocy. "I feel like you're hitting on me," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I probably wouldn't be, if I had a phone." She usually tried not to tell Park things like that. Like, all the things she didn't have. She waited for him to react, but he didn't. He just ran his thumb along the veins in her wrist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺说：“或许会吧，如果我家有电话的话。”通常她不跟帕克讲这类事。讲她没有这个、没有那个。她等待着帕克的反应，但是他没有，只是用拇指滑过她手腕的血管。">查看中文翻译</div>
