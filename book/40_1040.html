<div class="line_en">ATo fill the time, Laila fixed the screen door that Babi still hadn't got around to. She took down Babi's books, dusted and alphabetized them. She went to Chicken Street with Hasina, Giti, and Giti's mother, Nila, who was a seamstress and sometime sewing partner of Mammy's. In that week, Laila came to believe that of all the hardships a person had to face none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then one night Laila saw a tiny flashing light from down the street. A sound, something between a squeak and a gasp, escaped her lips. She quickly fished her own flashlight from under the bed, but it wouldn't work. Laila banged it against her palm, cursed the dead batteries. But it didn't matter. He was back. Laila sat on the edge of her bed, giddy with relief, and watched that beautiful, yellow eye winking on and off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，有一天晚上，莱拉看见街道那边有一道细小的电光照射过来。一个介于尖叫与喘息之间的声音从她嘴唇里跑出来。她匆忙从床底摸出她自己的手电筒，但它没有亮起来。莱拉用手掌拍拍手电筒，咒骂那该死的电池。但手电筒坏了也不要紧。他回来了。莱拉心中的石头落地了，她坐在床沿，晕晕乎乎的，看着那美丽的黄色眼睛一眨一眨，时明时灭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">ON HER WAY to Tariq's house the next day, Laila saw Khadim and a group of his friends across the street. Khadim was squatting, drawing something in the dirt with a stick. When he saw her, he dropped the stick and wiggled his fingers. He said something and there was a round of chuckles. Laila dropped her head and hurried past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，在去塔里克家的路上，莱拉看见卡迪姆和他的一群狐朋狗友在街道对面。卡迪姆蹲在地上，用一根棍子不知道在垃圾堆里掏什么东西。当看到她的时候，他丢掉棍子，晃动他的手指。他说了几句话，引来一阵笑声。莱拉垂下头，匆匆跑过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You mean our aroos, our daughter-in-law," his father announced, entering the room. He was a carpenter, a lean, white-haired man in his early sixties. He had gaps between his front teeth, and the squinty eyes of someone who had spent most of his life outdoors. He opened his arms and Laila went into them, greeted by his pleasant and familiar smell of sawdust. They kissed on the cheek three times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来是我们的儿媳妇啊。”他的父亲一边走进房间，一边大声说。他是个木匠，身材颀长，头发花白，年纪六十出头。他的门牙之间有几道牙缝，双眼眯斜，一看就是那种一辈子大多数时间都在屋外度过的人。他张开双臂，莱拉扑进他怀里，闻到一股熟悉的锯屑芬芳。他们相互亲了三次脸颊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tariq's mother said, passing by them. She was carrying a tray with a large bowl, a serving spoon, and four smaller bowls on it. She set the tray on the table. "Don't mind the old man." She cupped Laila's face. "It's good to see you, my dear. Come, sit down. I brought back some water-soaked fruit with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔里克的母亲从他们身边走过，说了一句。她端着一个托盘，上面有一个很大的碗，一把大勺子，还有四个小碗。她把托盘放在桌子上。“别跟这个老头较真啊，”她双手捧起莱拉的脸蛋，“亲爱的，看到你真好。来来，坐下。我从那边带回来一些水发的果肉[1]。”【注：[1]指浸泡在水里的果肉。将果肉浸泡在特制的水里可以延长保鲜期，国外常使用这种方法来保存水果。】">查看中文翻译</div>

It was covered with a moss green vinyl tablecloth with little magenta crescents and stars on it. Most of the living-room wall was taken up with pictures of Tariq at various ages. In some of the very early ones, he had two legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌子很大，是用颜色很浅的木头制成的，没有刷上油漆——塔里克的父亲做了这张桌子，那些椅子也是他做的。它铺着苔藓般翠绿的塑料桌布，桌布上面印着很多小小的淡红色月牙和星星。客厅墙面大多挂着塔里克在不同岁数时拍下的照片。在一些他还很小的照片中，他有两条腿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As long as Laila had known her, Tariq's mother had worn a wig. It was turning a dull purple with age. It was pulled low on her brow today, and Laila could see the gray hairs of her sideburns. Some days, it rode high on her forehead. But, to Laila, Tariq's mother never looked pitiable in it. What Laila saw was the calm, self-assured face beneath the wig, the clever eyes, the pleasant, unhurried manners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从莱拉认识她的时候起，塔里克的母亲就戴着一头假发。随着年月的流逝，它已经变成暗紫色的了。今天，她的假发在额前拉得很低，莱拉能够看到她两鬓苍苍的白发。有些时候，假发戴得很高，露出整个额头。但在莱拉看来，塔里克的母亲戴着假发时看上去一点都不可怜。莱拉所看到的，是假发下面那张安详而自信的脸，一双聪明的眼睛，还有那令人愉快的、从容不迫的举止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The truth was, Laila loved eating meals at Tariq's house as much as she disliked eating them at hers. At Tariq's, there was no eating alone; they always ate as a family. Laila liked the violet plastic drinking glasses they used and the quarter lemon that always floated in the water pitcher. She liked how they started each meal with a bowl of fresh yogurt, how they squeezed sour oranges on everything, even their yogurt, and how they made small, harmless jokes at each other's expense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，莱拉喜欢在塔里克家吃饭的程度，就跟她讨厌在自己家吃饭的程度一样。在塔里克家，没有人会单独吃饭；他们总是等齐了一起吃。莱拉喜欢他们家用的紫罗兰色塑料杯，也喜欢他们家的水罐里面总是漂着几片柠檬。他们每次吃饭，总是先喝一碗新鲜的酸奶；他们在所有的饭菜上，甚至在酸奶上，都滴上一些酸橙汁；吃饭的时候还相互开一些无伤大雅的小玩笑。所有这些都是莱拉喜欢的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have to," said his mother. "I'm making shorwa."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一定要在这里吃，”他母亲说，“我做了肉汤。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那就说定了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Imposing?" Tariq's mother said. "We leave for a couple of weeks and you turn polite on us?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会吧？”塔里克的母亲说，“我们才离开了几个星期，你就变得这么见外啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over meals, conversation always flowed. Though Tariq and his parents were ethnic Pashtuns, they spoke Farsi when Laila was around for her benefit, even though Laila more or less understood their native Pashto, having learned it in school. Babi said that there were tensions between their people -- the Tajiks, who were a minority, and Tariq's people, the Pashtuns, who were the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Tajiks have always felt slighted, Babi had said. Pashtun kings ruled this country for almost two hundred and fifty years, Laila, and Tajiks for all of nine months, back in 1929.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完饭后，他们总是会谈谈心。虽然塔里克和他的父母都是普什图人，但莱拉在场的时候，为了照顾她，他们用法尔西语交谈，尽管莱拉在学校学过普什图语，多少能听懂他们的母语。爸爸说他们这两类人——少数族裔的塔吉克人，还有普什图人，阿富汗的主要民族——之间的关系很紧张。塔吉克人总是觉得低人一等，爸爸曾经说，普什图血统的国王统治了这个国家将近两百五十年，莱拉，可是塔吉克人的统治加起来总共才九个月，而且还是1929年的陈年旧事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe so. But Laila never felt it in Tariq's house, where these matters never even came up.

<div class="line_en">Laila remembered the first time he'd shown her his stump. She'd been six. With one finger, she had poked the taut, shiny skin just below his left knee. Her finger had found little hard lumps there, and Tariq had told her they were spurs of bone that sometimes grew after an amputation. She'd asked him if his stump hurt, and he said it got sore at the end of the day, when it swelled and didn't fit the prosthesis like it was supposed to, like a finger in a thimble. And sometimes it gets rubbed. Especially when it's hot. Then I get rashes and blisters, but my mother has creams that help. It's not so bad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉还记得塔里克第一次让她看他的断腿的情形。当时她六岁。她伸出一根手指，去戳他左边膝盖下面那紧绷的、闪亮的皮肤。她的手指头摸到一些小小的硬块，塔里克说它们都是些骨刺，人们在截肢之后有时候会长骨刺。她问他这条断腿痛不痛，他说它本来和假肢接合得很好，但如果它在一天结束的时候发胀，和假肢接合不好，就会变得酸痛。跟手指套着顶针一个道理。有时候它会磨破。特别是天气热的时候。到时我就会发皮疹和起水疱，不过我母亲有一些药膏可以治这些。不算太糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>

I missed you, Hasina. Oh, I missed you too. In Tariq's grimace, Laila learned that boys differed from girls in this regard. They didn't make a show of friendship. They felt no urge, no need, for this sort of talk. Laila imagined it had been this way for her brothers too. Boys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed; its radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every night after dinner, Babi helped Laila with her homework and gave her some of his own. This was only to keep Laila a step or two ahead of her class, not because he disapproved of the work assigned by the school -- the propaganda teaching notwithstanding. In fact, Babi thought that the one thing the communists had done right -- or at least intended to -- ironically, was in the field of education, the vocation from which they had fired him. More specifically, the education of women. The government had sponsored literacy classes for all women. Almost two-thirds of the students at Kabul University were women now, Babi said, women who were studying law, medicine, engineering.</div>

<div class="line_en">By "out there," he didn't mean Kabul, which had always been relatively liberal and progressive. Here in Kabul, women taught at the university, ran schools, held office in the government. No, Babi meant the tribal areas, especially the Pashtun regions in the south or in the east near the Pakistani border, where women were rarely seen on the streets and only then in burqa and accompanied by men. He meant those regions where men who lived by ancient tribal laws had rebelled against the communists and their decrees to liberate women, to abolish forced marriage, to raise the minimum marriage age to sixteen for girls. There, men saw it as an insult to their centuries-old tradition, Babi said, to be told by the government -- and a godless one at that -- that their daughters had to leave home, attend school, and work alongside men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说的“那儿”并不是喀布尔，这个城市向来是相对自由和进步的地方。在喀布尔这里，女人可以在大学里教书，当中小学校长，在政府中拥有一官半职。不，爸爸说的是那些种族聚居的地方，尤其是南部或者东部毗邻巴基斯坦国界的普什图人聚居地。那些地方的街道上很少能看到妇女，上街的妇女都穿着布卡，有男人陪同。在他指的那些地区，男人信奉祖先传下的古老民俗，这些人反抗共产党人和他们的信条——解放妇女，废除强迫婚姻，把女孩的最低结婚年龄提高到十六岁。爸爸说，政府——而且是一个不信真主的政府——教导人们要放女人离开家门，上学接受教育，和男人一起工作，但那儿的男人认为这亵渎了他们祖国的古老传统。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Women have always had it hard in this country, Laila, but they're probably more free now, under the communists, and have more rights than they've ever had before, Babi said, always lowering his voice, aware of how intolerant Mammy was of even remotely positive talk of the communists. But it's true, Babi said, it's a good time to be a woman in Afghanistan. And you can take advantage of that, Laila. Of course, women's freedom -- here, he shook his head ruefully -- is also one of the reasons people out there took up arms in the first place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个国家，女人的日子总是过得很辛苦，莱拉，但现在，在共产党的统治下，她们也许更自由了，比以前拥有更多的权利，爸爸说，说的时候总是压低嗓音，他知道就算对共产党作出最为无关紧要的正面评价，也会惹得妈妈暴跳如雷。但这是真的，爸爸说，现在是阿富汗妇女的好年代。你可以利用这个大环境，莱拉。当然了，妇女的自由——说到这儿，他悲伤地摇摇头——也是促使那儿的人们拿起武器的首要原因之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
