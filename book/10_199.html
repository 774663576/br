<div class="line_en">When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="睁开眼睛的时候，比尔博怀疑自己到底有没有睁开眼睛，因为眼前跟闭着眼睛一样漆黑。他的近旁没有任何人。啊！他心中的惶恐可想而知！他什么也听不见，什么也看不到，除了脚下的石头地之外，他什么也感觉不到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; but neither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the direction they had been going in when he had his fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It was a turning point in his career, but he did not know it. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem of any particular use at the moment. He did not go much further, but sat down on the cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long while. He thought of himself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at home-for he could feel inside that it was high time for some meal or other; but that only made him miserabler.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他慢慢地坐起身来，四肢并用地四下摸索着，直到触摸到隧道的墙壁，但他在墙的上面和下面都找不到任何东西：什么也没有，既没有半兽人的迹象，也没有矮人的迹象。他的脑袋晕晕乎乎的，连自己摔倒之前在朝哪个方向走都根本无法确定。他勉强猜了一个方向，然后朝着那个方向爬了很长一段距离，直到他的手突然在地上摸到一个小小的、像是用冰冷金属做成的戒指。这是他生涯上的转折点，但他自己还不知道。他想也不想就把戒指放进口袋，当时这戒指看来似乎并没有什么特别的用场。他没有再往下走，而是坐在了冰冷的地面上，长时间地陷入了自哀自怜之中。他想起了自己在自家屋子的厨房里煎火腿蛋的情景，这其实是因为他的身体告诉他该吃点东西了，可是，这样的想像只能让他越发感到心中悲苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken, and that was something. Then he felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco in it, and that was something more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible place. Still at the moment he felt very crushed. But in slapping all his pockets and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the hilt of his little sword-the little dagger that he got from the trolls, and that he had quite forgotten; nor fortunately had the goblins noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了一会儿之后，他从身上摸出了烟斗。烟斗居然没有折断，这可真是有点了不得。然后他又摸出烟草袋，里面居然还有一些烟草，这也是让他没想到的。然后，他又开始摸火柴——这回什么也没摸到，这下子把他刚升起的希望给整个击碎了。等他恢复理智之后，他又庆幸自己没找到火柴。天知道在这个可怕的地方，一旦他划燃了火柴，烟草散发出了味道，从那些黑咕隆冬的洞洞里，会有什么样的东西被招引来。即便如此，他在当时还是觉得十分沮丧。但就在他翻遍所有的口袋，浑身上下找火柴的过程中，他的手摸到了身上短剑的剑柄——也就是之前他从食人妖洞穴找来的那把小匕首，他简直都快把它给忘了。不过幸运的是半兽人们也没有注意到，因为他把它藏在了马裤里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why he had been left behind; or why, if he had been left behind, the goblins had not caught him; or even why his head was so sore. The truth was he had been lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想不出来该做些什么，也弄不明白到底发生了什么事情，或是自己为什么会被大家撇下，又或者，如果他真的被撇下了，半兽人为什么没有抓住他？为什么他的脑袋会这么痛？事实的真相是：他一直躺在一个非常黑暗的死角里，没有发出一点声音，所以既没被人看见，也没被人想起，就这样一躺就是好久。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But somehow he was comforted. It was rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in Gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also he had noticed that such weapons made a great impression on goblins that came upon them suddenly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但不管怎样他得到了一些安慰。他此时佩戴的可是刚多林打造的武器，是为那场曾有那么多歌谣加以吟咏的对半兽人的战争而打造的，这让他觉得自己身价陡增。此外，他还注意到，当半兽人突然遭遇到这样的武器时，往往会感到分外惶恐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go back?" he thought. "No good at all! Go sideways? Impossible! Go forward? Only thing to do! On we go!" So up he got, and trotted along with his little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all of a patter and a pitter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“往回走吗？”他想，“绝对不行！往旁边走？不可能！往前走？这是惟一该做的事情！继续前进！”想到这里，他站起身来，把短剑拿在身前，一只手扶着墙，快步往前走去，一颗心扑通扑通扑通扑通地跳得好响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must remember it was not quite so tight for him as it would have been for me or for you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are nice cheery places and properly aired, quite different from the tunnels of the goblins, still they are more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their sense of direction underground-not when their heads have recovered from being bumped. Also they can move very quietly, and hide easily, and recover wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of wisdom and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，比尔博肯定正在紧要关头，不过，大家一定要记住，同样的情况对霍比特人总不会像对你我这样的普通人要命。霍比特人和我们这些普通人不同，尽管他们的洞府是可爱而又欢乐的好地方，通风状况良好，和半兽人的隧道很不一样，但他们还是比我们更能适应这些地底的隧道，也更不容易丧失在地下的方向感——当然，这得是在他们的脑袋挨撞恢复正常之后。此外，他们也能够悄无声息地移动，轻巧地掩藏行迹，磕磕碰碰之后复原的速度也很惊人。他们还拥有许许多多的古老谚语，人类要不是从来没听到过，就是很早便忘记了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he drew it out. It shone pale and dim before his eyes. "So it is an elvish blade, too," he thought; "and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，他将匕首拔了出来，匕首在他眼前闪着苍白微弱的光芒。“原来这也是精灵打造的武器，”他想道，“半兽人离得不会太近，可也不会太远。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins' place, all the same. The tunnel seemed to have no end. All he knew was that it was still going down pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of a twist and a turn or two. There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he knew by the glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand on the wall. Of these he took no notice, except to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined dark things coming out of them. On and on he went, and down and down; and still he heard no sound of anything except the occasional whirr of a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. I do not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过即使如此，恐怕也还是没人愿意身处巴金斯先生此时的处境中。隧道看上去似乎没有尽头，他惟一能够确定的就是，这条隧道依旧在持续向下，虽然其间会来上一个转弯或出现一两个拐角，但大方向一直没变过。时不时地，比尔博凭借手中宝剑的光芒，或是触摸洞壁的结果，可以确定会有通往两侧的岔路。对于这些岔路他基本没有放在心上，除了通过的时候加快些脚步，以防有半兽人或是一半出自他想像的恐怖东西从那里面蹿出来。他不停地走呀走呀，一直在往下。不过走了这许久，除了偶尔有一只蝙蝠从耳边啪啪飞过外，他什么声音也没有听到。一开始蝙蝠拍翅膀的声音还会让他吓一跳，后来听多了也就见怪不怪了。我不知道他这样坚持了多久，不想再走了，却又不敢停下来，只好走，走，走，从累坏了走到累惨了，又走到累翻了。他感觉自己已经从今天走到了明天，甚至已经走了有好几天了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly without any warning he trotted splash into water! Ugh! it was icy cold. That pulled him up sharp and short. He did not know whether it was just a pool in the path, or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage, or the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake. The sword was hardly shining at all. He stopped, and he could hear, when he listened hard, drops drip-drip-dripping from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no other sort of sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，毫无征兆地，他扑通一声踏进了水中。呃！这水冰冷刺骨，让他猛地一个激灵。他不知道这究竟是道路上的一小潭积水，还是横贯隧道的一条地底河流，又或是某个深邃黑暗的地下湖的边缘。到了这里，宝剑已经几乎没有什么闪光了。他停下脚步，凝神倾听，可以听见从看不见的洞顶“嗒——嗒——嗒”落到下面水潭里的水滴声，除此之外似乎就没有别的声音了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don't know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum-as dark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He had a little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and deep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large feet dangling over the side, but never a ripple did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his pale lamp-like eyes for blind fish, which he grabbed with his long fingers as quick as thinking. He liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, when he could get it; but he took care they never found him out. He just throttled them from behind, if they ever came down alone anywhere near the edge of the water, while he was prowling about. They very seldom did, for they had a feeling that something unpleasant was lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. They had come on the lake, when they were tunnelling down long ago, and they found they could go no further; so there their road ended in that direction, and there was no reason to go that way-unless the Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这地底深处的一池黑水边，住着一个矮小的、滑腻腻的老家伙名叫咕噜。我不知道他来自何方，也不知道他究竟是谁，或是什么生物。他就是咕噜，黑得就像周遭的黑暗，除了瘦脸上那双大而苍白的圆眼。他有一艘小船，他在湖上寂静地划行，这个湖又广又深，死一般地冰冷。他的两只大脚伸出船舷外拍水前进，却连一点水声都不弄出来，绝对是一点也没有。他用那双像油灯一样的苍白大眼搜寻湖中的盲鱼，再用快捷如闪念的细长手指将它们抓起来。他也喜欢吃肉。如果能抓到半兽人的话，他会觉得半兽人吃起来也不错，但他行事小心，从不会让半兽人发现他的行迹。在他四处游走寻找猎物的时候，若是有半兽人孤身来到水边，他就会从背后一下勒住他的脖子。但半兽人很少会孤身到水边来，因为他们也感觉到在这山底的深处，潜伏着某种不祥之物。很久以前，在挖掘隧道的时候，他们曾经到湖上来过，当时他们发现隧道挖不下去了，所以，通往这个方向的路就断在了这里，因此半兽人是没有理由到这里来的——除非他们的大王派他们来。有时候，大王会心血来潮想要吃湖中的鱼，但好多次，不仅鱼没有送来，就连捕鱼的半兽人也一去不回了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So it is a pool or a lake, and not an underground river," he thought. Still he did not dare to wade out into the darkness. He could not swim; and he thought, too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in the water. There are strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains: fish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never swam out again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; also there are other things more slimy than fish. Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have made for themselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. Some of these caves, too, go back in their beginnings to ages before the goblins, who only widened them and joined them up with passages, and the original owners are still there in odd corners, slinking and nosing about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来，这应该是个水潭或者湖泊，而不是一条地下河。”他想道。但他还是不敢往那一片黑暗中涉水而去。他不会游泳，而且，在他脑中开始浮现出了水中那些恶心的滑腻腻的东西，它们长着突出的盲眼，在水中蠕动着。在山脉底下的水潭里或是湖泊中的确有奇怪的东西：那是一些鱼，它们的祖先不知多少年代以前游来了此地，之后就再也没游出去过，它们的眼睛因为竭力要在黑暗中看清东西，变得越来越大、越来越大、越来越大。除此之外，这里还有比这种鱼更加滑腻腻的东西。即使是在半兽人为他们自己开凿的隧道与洞穴中，也有一些不为他们所知的生物从外面悄悄溜进来，生活在这一片黑暗之中。这些洞穴中有些是比半兽人更早的存在，他们只是将其拓宽，然后以通道相连而已，而这些洞穴原先的主人则依旧躲在一些零星的角落里悄悄行走着，用鼻子嗅着四周的气息。">查看中文翻译</div>

This is what he had come to find out, for he was not really very hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他嘶嘶谁，我的宝贝？”咕噜低语道（由于从来没有其他人可以对话，他总是喜欢自言自语）。这是他跑到比尔博跟前来的真正原因，因为他这会儿肚子其实并不是很饿，只是感到很好奇，否则他会先出手把他抓了再跟他说话的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while Bilbo was sitting on the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his wits. Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed:</div>

<div class="line_en">Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. He was watching Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes. Bilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could see that he was no goblin at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实咕噜就居住在湖中央一块潮湿的岩石上。此刻，他正用他那双像望远镜一般的大白眼远远地观察着比尔博。比尔博看不见他，但他却在好奇地琢磨着比尔博，因为，他可以看得出来，眼前的生物不是半兽人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sssss" said Gollum, and became quite polite. "Praps ye sits here and chats with it a bitsy, my preciousss. It likes riddles, praps it does, does it?" He was anxious to appear friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he found out more about the sword and the hobbit, whether he was quite alone really, whether he was good to eat, and whether Gollum was really hungry. Riddles were all he could think of. Asking them, and sometimes guessing them, had been the only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept down, down, into the dark under the mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘶嘶，”咕噜变得颇有礼貌起来，“或许你可以坐在这里，和他嘶嘶说说话，我的宝贝。他喜欢猜谜，也许喜欢，嘶不嘶？”他急着要摆出一副友好的样子，至少暂时如此，以了解更多有关这把宝剑和这个霍比特人的事情：他是不是真的只有孤身一人？他吃起来味道好不好？咕噜自己的肚子是不是真的饿了等等。猜谜是他当时惟一能想到的。出谜语给人猜，有时候也猜别人出的谜语，这是他和那些居住在自己洞穴里的其他有趣生物之间惟一玩过的游戏，但那是很久很久以前的事了，后来他失去了所有的朋友，被人赶走，孤身一人，往下钻，往下钻，一直来到这黑暗的大山最深处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious." So he had always said to himself. But who knows how Gollum came by that present, ages ago in the old days when such rings were still at large in the world? Perhaps even the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; and now usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always going back to look at it. And still sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear to be parted from it any longer, or when he was very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then he would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins. He might even venture into places where the torches were lit and made his eyes blink and smart; for he would be safe. Oh yes, quite safe. No one would see him, no one would notice him, till he had his fingers on their throat. Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted something softer.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What has it got in its pocketses?" he heard the hiss loud behind him, and the splash as Gollum leapt from his boat.

Gollum had not actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. And he was miserable, alone, lost.

<div class="line_en">Then there was a silence. But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo. "If goblins are so near that he smelt them," he thought, "then they'll have heard his shrieking and cursing. Careful now, or this way will lead you to worse things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后是一片死寂，但这对于比尔博来说，依旧充满着危险。“如果半兽人近到可以被咕噜闻到气味，那么他们也会听见他的尖叫和咒骂。从现在起得打起十二万分的精神了，不然这一路还不知道会遇到怎样可怕的事情呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gollum threw himself backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but too late: his hands snapped on thin air, and Bilbo, falling fair on his sturdy feet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum was doing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at first, then it stopped. All at once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled with hatred and despair. Gollum was defeated. He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo's heart to his mouth, but still he held on. Now faint as an echo, but menacing, the voice came behind:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕噜立刻转过身去，在霍比特人跃过头顶时朝空中抓去，但还是慢了一拍：他的双手只抓到了薄薄的空气，比尔博则凭了他那健壮的双脚稳稳落地，朝着这条新的隧道飞奔而去。他没有回头去看咕噜在干些什么。刚开始，他可以听见嘶嘶声和咒骂声就追着他的脚后跟，后来那声音停了下来，几乎与此同时，后方传来一声让人血液为之冻结的尖叫，叫声中充满了仇恨与绝望。咕噜被打败了，他不敢再往前走了，他已经输了：他不仅追丢了猎物，更弄丢了他这辈子惟一在乎的东西，他的宝贝。这声尖叫让比尔博的心悬到了嗓子眼儿，但他继续不停步地往前跑着。那微弱得如同回声，但充满威胁的喊声从背后传来：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum's head he jumped, seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, had he known it, he only just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一跃对人类来说算不了什么，但这却是在黑暗中的奋力一跃。他直直地跃过了咕噜的头顶，往前飞了七呎，跃起空中有三呎。幸亏他不知道，他的脑袋差一点就砸在了通道那低矮的拱门上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and came suddenly right into an open space, where the light, after all that time in the dark, seemed dazzlingly bright. Really it was only a leak of sunshine in through a doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他让双腿带着自己尽力飞奔，绕过最后的弯角，终于跑进一片开阔的空间。他在黑暗中待了那么久之后，这里的光线让他觉得十分刺眼。其实，这还只是从门缝中漏进来洒在门道内的一点阳光，门道尽头的一扇石门居然是开着的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the hobbit, except when, in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes again, several times, on nasty jagged stones in the floor. "A bit low for goblins, at least for the big ones," thought Bilbo, not knowing that even the big ones, the orcs of the mountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条隧道不仅低矮，造得也十分简陋。这对于霍比特人来说，并不算太难走，除了有几次，尽管他已经十分当心了，他那可怜的脚趾头还是踢到了地上那些讨厌的坑坑洼洼的碎石。“对半兽人来说有点矮，至少对那些大个子是这样。”比尔博想。其实他不知道，即使是大个子的半兽人，由于习惯了山里的生活，也可以弯着身子，双手几乎垂地，飞快地行走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a while it climbed steeply. That slowed Bilbo down. But at last the slope stopped, the passage turned a corner and dipped down again, and there, at the bottom of a short incline, he saw, filtering round another corner-a glimpse of light. Not red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of-doors sort of light. Then Bilbo began to run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，一直在往下的隧道开始往上走了，又过了一阵之后，它更是变得陡峭起来。这让比尔博的速度慢了下来。但到了最后，向上的斜坡到头了，隧道转过一个弯，又开始往下走。远方，在一小段下坡的尽头，从又一个拐角的后面，透过来一缕亮光。那不是营火或灯笼之类放出的红光，而是一缕白色的天光。比尔博开始跑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and watching the passage that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博眨眨眼，这时他突然看见了半兽人：几个半兽人全副武装，手拿刀剑，就坐在门里边，眼睛睁得大大的盯着门，也盯着通往大门的门道。他们已经严阵以待，为即将到来的一切作好了准备。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was an accident, or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on his finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博还没看见他们的时候他们就已经看见比尔博了。对，他们看见他了。不知这是个意外，还是戒指在认自己的新主人之前开的最后一个玩笑，反正这会儿它没有在比尔博的手指上。半兽人欢呼着朝他冲了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A pang of fear and loss, like an echo of Gollum's misery, smote Bilbo, and forgetting even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets. And there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. The goblins stopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had vanished. They yelled twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵恐惧和茫然向比尔博袭来，那简直像是咕噜的痛苦所激起的回声。他甚至忘记了去拔剑，而是将手伸进了口袋。戒指依然还在，就在他左边的口袋中，手刚一伸进去，戒指就滑了上去。半兽人们戛然止住了脚步——他们一点都看不见他了，他就这么凭空消失了。他们发出比之前高过一倍的吼叫声，但不是刚才的那种欢呼了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to. Bilbo struggled but he could not move it. He tried to squeeze through the crack. He squeezed and squeezed, and he stuck! It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on the edge of the door and the door-post. He could see outside into the open air: there were a few steps running down into a narrow valley between tall mountains; the sun came out from behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside of the door-but he could not get through.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I must get to the door, I must get to the door!" he kept on saying to himself, but it was a long time before he ventured to try. Then it was like a horrible game of blind-man's-buff. The place was full of goblins running about, and the poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was knocked over by a goblin who could not make out what he had bumped into, scrambled away on all fours, slipped between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the trees. But they don't like the sun: it makes their legs wobble and their heads giddy.

Bilbo had escaped.</div>
