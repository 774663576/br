<div class="line_en">She went home and forced herself to eat a stand-up lunch in the kitchen. At half past three, she put Karenin on his leash and walked (walking again) to the outskirts of town where her hotel was. When they fired Tereza from her job at the magazine, she found work behind the bar of a hotel. It happened several months after she came back from Zurich: they could not forgive her, in the end, for the week she spent photographing Russian tanks. She got the job through friends, other people who had taken refuge there when thrown out of work by the Russians: a former professor of theology in the accounting office, an ambassador (who had protested against the invasion on foreign television) at the reception desk.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was worried about her legs again. While working as a waitress in the small-town restaurant, she had been horrified at the sight of the older waitresses' varicose veins, a professional hazard that came of a life of walking, running, and standing with heavy loads. But the new job was less demanding: although she began each shift by dragging out heavy cases of beer and mineral water, all she had to do then was stand behind the bar, serve the customers their drinks, and wash out the glasses in the small sink on her side of the bar. And through it all she had Karenin lying docilely at her feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她重又担心起自己的腿来。以前，她在外省当女招待时，发现她的同行腿肚子上尽是曲张的静脉，她很害怕。这是女招待的职业病，因为她们手上总是端着沉沉的东西，不是走，就是跑，要么就是站着。现在的工作倒没以前在外省时那么累人。在开门为客人服务之前，她要搬运一箱箱沉重的啤酒和矿泉水，之后她只要站在柜台后面，给客人倒倒酒，有空的时候，在吧台末端的小洗碗槽里涮涮杯子。在她工作时，卡列宁一直耐心地躺在她脚旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was long past midnight before she had finished her accounts and delivered the cash receipts to the hotel director. She then went to say good-bye to the ambassador, who had night duty. The door behind the reception desk led to a tiny room with a narrow cot where he could take a nap. The wall above the cot was covered with framed photographs of himself and various people smiling at the camera or shaking his hand or sitting next to him at a table and signing something or other. Some of them were autographed. In the place of honor hung a picture showing, side by side with his own face, the smiling face of John F. Kennedy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等她算完账，把钱交给饭店经理，午夜已过。她先过去对值夜班的大使道声晚安。在服务台的长柜台后，有扇门，门后是个凹室，正好摆得下一张窄床睡觉。凹室的墙上，挂着几张镶边框的照片：照片上，可以看到他和许多人在一起，他们在冲着镜头微笑或者在和他握手，或者坐在他身边签什么东西。在一张挂在醒目位置的照片上，可以辨认出紧挨着他的，是约翰·弗·肯尼迪那张微笑的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Tereza entered the room that night, she found him talking not to Kennedy but to a man of about sixty whom she had never seen before and who fell silent as soon as he saw her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天晚上，他不是在与美国总统交谈，而是与一个六十来岁的陌生男人，这人一看到特蕾莎，马上就闭上了嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's all right, said the ambassador. She's a friend. You can speak freely in front of her. Then he turned to Tereza. His son got five years today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是个朋友，”大使说，“你尽管放心地讲。”接着，他转向特蕾莎，说：“他儿子被判了五年，恐怕就在今天判的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During the first days of the invasion, she learned, the man's son and some friends had stood watch over the entrance to a building housing the Russian army special staff. Since any Czechs they saw coming or going were clearly agents in the service of the Russians, he and his friends trailed them, traced the number plates of their cars, and passed on the information to the pro-Dubcek clandestine radio and television broadcasters, who then warned the public. In the process the boy and his friends had given one of the traitors a thorough going over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她了解到，在入侵最初的几个日子里，这人的儿子和他的几个朋友一直监视一幢大楼的入口，这幢楼是一个俄军特别机构的所在地。从那里出来的捷克人，在他看来，肯定都是为俄国人效力的告密者。他和同伴跟踪他们，记下他们的车牌号码，告诉一家捷克地下电台的新闻记者，由电台提醒公众注意。他甚至在朋友们的协助下，把其中的一个家伙狠狠地揍了一顿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Walking home with Karenin through nocturnal Prague, she thought of the days she had spent photographing tanks. How naive they had been, thinking they were risking their lives for their country when in fact they were helping the Russian police.</div>
