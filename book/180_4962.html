<div class="line_en">She looked now at the drawing-room step. She saw, through William's eyes, the shape of a woman, peaceful and silent, with downcast eyes. She sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that day, Lily thought). Her eyes were bent. She would never lift them. Yes, thought Lily, looking intently, I must have seen her look like that, but not in grey; nor so still, nor so young, nor so peaceful. The figure came readily enough. She was astonishingly beautiful, as William said. But beauty was not everything. Beauty had this penalty -- it came too readily, came too completely. It stilled life -- froze it. One forgot the little agitations; the flush, the pallor, some queer distortion, some light or shadow, which made the face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw for ever after. It was simpler to smooth that all out under the cover of beauty. But what was the look she had, Lily wondered, when she clapped her deer-stalkers's hat on her head, or ran across the grass, or scolded Kennedy, the gardener? Who could tell her? Who could help her?</div>

<div class="line_en">Against her will she had come to the surface, and found herself half out of the picture, looking, little dazedly, as if at unreal things, at Mr Carmichael. He lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his paunch not reading, or sleeping, but basking like a creature gorged with existence. His book had fallen on to the grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很不情愿地从沉思中返回到外部世界中来，发现自己思绪已不在画上，她像看什么虚幻的东西一般茫然地看着卡迈克尔先生。他躺在椅子上，两手交叉着放在巨大的肚子上，既没有在看书，也没有睡觉，而是像个吃饱了就满足的动物在晒太阳。他的书已经掉在了草地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wanted to go straight up to him and say, "Mr Carmichael!" Then he would look up benevolently as always, from his smoky vague green eyes. But one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them. And she wanted to say not one thing, but everything. Little words that broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing. "About life, about death; about Mrs Ramsay"-- no, she thought, one could say nothing to nobody. The urgency of the moment always missed its mark. Words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low. Then one gave it up; then the idea sunk back again; then one became like most middle-aged people, cautious, furtive, with wrinkles between the eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension. For how could one express in words these emotions of the body? express that emptiness there? (She was looking at the drawing-room steps; they looked extraordinarily empty.) It was one's body feeling, not one's mind. The physical sensations that went with the bare look of the steps had become suddenly extremely unpleasant. To want and not to have, sent all up her body a hardness, a hollowness, a strain. And then to want and not to have -- to want and want -- how that wrung the heart, and wrung it again and again! Oh, Mrs Ramsay! she called out silently, to that essence which sat by the boat, that abstract one made of her, that woman in grey, as if to abuse her for having gone, and then having gone, come back again. It had seemed so safe, thinking of her. Ghost, air, nothingness, a thing you could play with easily and safely at any time of day or night, she had been that, and then suddenly she put her hand out and wrung the heart thus. Suddenly, the empty drawing-room steps, the frill of the chair inside, the puppy tumbling on the terrace, the whole wave and whisper of the garden became like curves and arabesques flourishing round a centre of complete emptiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很想直接走到他的面前对他说，“卡迈克尔先生！”于是他会和平时一样抬起那双朦胧呆滞的绿眼睛，仁慈地看着她。可是人们只有在知道要对别人说些什么的时候才会叫醒他们。但她想说的不是一件事，而是一切的事。打乱并割裂思想的零星碎语什么也表达不了。“关于生活，关于死亡；关于拉姆齐夫人”——不，她想，她没法对任何人说任何事。一时的紧迫感之下说出的话从不能达到目的。词句飘向一侧，打在目标下方几英寸之处。于是人们就放弃了；那想法重又沉入心底；人们变得像多数中年人一样，谨慎、诡秘、眉间刻着皱纹，一付忧虑的神情。因为人们如何能用语言表达这样的肉体的情感？表达在那儿存在着的空虚？（她正凝视着客厅的台阶；它们显得非常空落。）这是人的肉体上的感受，不是心灵上的。和空落落的台阶一起到来的肉体的感觉突然变得令人极端不快。想要却得不到，这使她全身产生了一种硬邦邦、空虚和紧张的感觉。想要却得不到——想要再想要——这是如何使人悲痛、一而再地使人悲痛的事啊！啊，拉姆齐夫人！她默默地呼喊着，向着那个坐在船旁的存在，那个由她而生的抽象的形体，那个穿灰色衣服的女人，呼喊，似乎在责怪她的离去，责怪她离去以后又重新归来。她原觉得思念她似乎是很安全的。她是幽灵，是空气、是虚无、是一件白天黑夜任何时候由着你随意地安全地玩弄的东西，她也一直是这样一件东西，然而突然之间她却伸出手来如此使劲地折磨你的心。突然，客厅前空落落的台阶、客厅内椅子的饰边、在平台上打滚玩的小狗、花园里的草浪和风的低语，全都变成了华丽地装饰在一个完全空无的中心的四周的曲线和阿拉伯式的图案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A curious notion came to her that he did after all hear the things she could not say. He was an inscrutable old man, with the yellow stain on his beard, and his poetry, and his puzzles, sailing serenely through a world which satisfied all his wants, so that she thought he had only to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish up anything he wanted. She looked at her picture. That would have been his answer, presumably -- how "you" and "I" and "she" pass and vanish; nothing stays; all changes; but not words, not paint. Yet it would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be rolled up and flung under a sofa; yet even so, even of a picture like that, it was true. One might say, even of this scrawl, not of that actual picture, perhaps, but of what it attempted, that it "remained for ever," she was going to say, or, for the words spoken sounded even to herself, too boastful, to hint, wordlessly; when, looking at the picture, she was surprised to find that she could not see it. Her eyes were full of a hot liquid (she did not think of tears at first) which, without disturbing the firmness of her lips, made the air thick, rolled down her cheeks. She had perfect control of herself -- Oh, yes!-- in every other way. Was she crying then for Mrs Ramsay, without being aware of any unhappiness? She addressed old Mr Carmichael again. What was it then? What did it mean? Could things thrust their hands up and grip one; could the blade cut; the fist grasp? Was there no safety? No learning by heart of the ways of the world? No guide, no shelter, but all was miracle, and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air? Could it be, even for elderly people, that this was life?-- startling, unexpected, unknown? For one moment she felt that if they both got up, here, now on the lawn, and demanded an explanation, why was it so short, why was it so inexplicable, said it with violence, as two fully equipped human beings from whom nothing should be hid might speak, then, beauty would roll itself up; the space would fill; those empty flourishes would form into shape; if they shouted loud enough Mrs Ramsay would return. "Mrs Ramsay!" she said aloud, "Mrs Ramsay!" The tears ran down her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她产生了一个奇异的念头，觉得他还是听到了她未能说出来的话。他是一个令人费解的老人，带着沾在胡子上的黄色污渍、他的诗作、和他那令人难解的一切，安详地航行在一个满足了他一切需要的世界上，她甚至认为他只需在草坪上他躺着的那个地方放下手去就能够捞起任何他所需要的东西。她看着她的画。她猜想他的回答会是——“你”和“我”和“她”都会死亡消失；没有任何东西是永存的；一切都在变；但是文字不会变，绘画不会变。然而，她想，画会被挂在阁楼上；会被卷起来扔在沙发底下；但即便如此，即使是那样的一张画，也还是不会变的。你可以说，甚至是这幅信笔涂画的东西，还不是那幅画成的画，而只是一个企图，也会“永远存在”，她打算这样说，或者只是无言地暗示出这层意思，因为这些字如果说出来，连她自己听了也会觉得过于吹嘘了；当她去看这回画时，她惊奇地发现她看不见它了。她眼中充满了滚烫的液体（她一开始并没有想到是眼泪），使视线模糊，并顺着面颊滚落下来，但并没有影响她嘴唇的坚定。她在其他的一切方面都能很好地控制自己——哦，是的！那么她是在为拉姆齐夫人而哭，却又并未意识到任何不快活吗？她又想像在和老卡迈克尔先生说话了。那么是怎么回事呢？这意味着什么，事物会伸出手来抓住你吗；刀会砍伤人吗；拳头会攥紧起来吗？难道就没有安全了吗？无法懂得世界的规律吗？没有指导、没有庇护、而一切都是奇迹，只能从塔尖纵身跃入空中吗？难道，即使对老年人来说，这就是生活？——令人吃惊、出乎意料、神秘未知？片刻之间她感到如果他们两人都站起来，就在此时此地，在草坪上，要求得到一个解释，为什么生命是如此短暂，为什么如此费解，如果他们说时口气激烈，像两个有充分准备的、不应对他们隐瞒任何事情的人，那么美将会自动蜷缩起来，空白将被填满，那些空洞的装饰会构成形态；如果他们呼叫的声音够响的话，拉姆齐夫人就会回来。“拉姆齐夫人！”她说出了声来，“拉姆齐夫人！”眼泪流下了她的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What does it mean? How do you explain it all?" she wanted to say, turning to Mr Carmichael again. For the whole world seemed to have dissolved in this early morning hour into a pool of thought, a deep basin of reality, and one could almost fancy that had Mr Carmichael spoken, for instance, a little tear would have rent the surface pool. And then? Something would emerge. A hand would be shoved up, a blade would be flashed. It was nonsense of course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是什么意思？你如何解释这一切？”她再次转身向着卡迈克尔先生，想这样问他，因为在这个清晨，整个世界似乎都融化成了一个思想的深潭，一个现实的深湾，她几乎可以想像，如果卡迈克尔先生说了话，会有小小的一滴眼泪打破潭面的平静。那么然后呢？会有什么东西浮现。会有一只手伸出水面，一把刀闪出寒光。当然这都是一派胡言。">查看中文翻译</div>
