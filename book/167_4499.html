<div class="line_en">He padded over dry needles and brown leaves, to the edge of the wood where the pines grew thin. Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the swirling flames. The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat, so strong he began to slaver.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet as one smell drew them onward, others warned them back. He sniffed at the drifting smoke. Men, many men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire. No smell was more dangerous, not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of manclaws and hardskin. The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.</div>

<div class="line_en">All through the night the fires crackled, and once there was a great roar and a crash that made the earth jump under his feet. Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror. Howls shuddered through the night; the howls of the man-pack, wails of fear and wild shouts, laughter and screams. No beast was as noisy as man. He pricked up his ears and listened, and his brother growled at every sound. They prowled under the trees as a piney wind blew ashes and embers through the sky. In time the flames began to dwindle, and then they were gone. The sun rose grey and smoky that morning. Only then did he leave the trees, stalking slow across the fields. His brother ran with him, drawn to the smell of blood and death. They padded silent through the dens the men had built of wood and grass and mud. Many and more were burned and many and more were collapsed; others stood as they had before. Yet nowhere did they see or scent a living man. Crows blanketed the bodies and leapt into the air screeching when his brother and he came near. The wild dogs slunk away before them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily, struggling to rise on a broken leg and screaming when he fell. His brother circled round him, then tore out his throat while the horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes. When he approached the carcass his brother snapped at him and laid back his ears, and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg. They fought amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse, until his brother rolled on his back in submission, tail tucked low. One more bite at his upturned throat; then he fed, and let his brother feed, and licked the blood off his black fur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雄伟的灰壁下，一匹垂死的马大声闹嚷，它想用断腿挣扎站立，却屡屡嘶叫着倒下。弟弟围着它转圈，然后一口撕开它的喉咙，马儿无力地踢打几下，闭上了眼睛。他朝马尸体走去，弟弟却一口咬来，衔住他耳朵往后拖，于是他拿前脚环住对方，反咬弟弟的腿。他们在草地、泥土和散落的灰烬之中争斗，为死马而扭打，直到弟弟仰面朝天，卷起尾巴，表示顺服为止。他朝弟弟暴露的喉头咬了最后一小口，然后开始用餐，并让弟弟也参加。吃饱后，他帮弟弟舔掉黑毛上的血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dark place was pulling at him by then, the house of whispers where all men were blind. He could feel its cold fingers on him. The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose. He struggled against the pull. He did not like the darkness. He was wolf. He was hunter and stalker and slayer, and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods, running free beneath a starry sky. He sat on his haunches, raised his head, and howled. I will not go, he cried. I am wolf, I will not go. Yet even so the darkness thickened, until it covered his eyes and filled his nose and stopped his ears, so he could not see or smell or hear or run, and the grey cliffs were gone and the dead horse was gone and his brother was gone and all was black and still and black and cold and black and dead and black…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，黑暗角落的呼唤突然传来，喃喃的低语把他往那座什么也看不见的房子拖。冰冷的召唤，带着石头气息，盖过所有扰攘。他挣扎，抗拒那份引力。他厌恶黑暗。他是狼，他是猎人、游侠和杀手，他属于辽阔大森林里的兄弟姐妹，他希望自由自在奔跑于星斗之下。于是他坐下来，仰天长嗥。我不要去，他高喊，我是狼，我不要去。然而黑暗却逐渐笼罩，蒙住眼睛，灌满鼻子，遮掩耳朵，他看不见、听不到、闻不出、跑不动。灰壁消失，死马不见，弟弟无踪，一切都化为黑暗。沉寂、黑暗、冰冷、黑暗、死亡、黑暗…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他闭上第三只眼，睁开其余的两只，老旧的两只，瞎盲的两只。理所当然，在黑暗中人类都是瞎子。但有人紧搂着他，他感觉出胳膊的环绕，体会到依偎的温暖。阿多在不断念叨：“阿多，阿多，阿多，”他自己保持沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I ate," said Bran. "We ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal him." The cat had been tan-andbrown, only half the size of the direwolves, but fierce. He remembered the musky smell of him, and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb of the oak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我吃过，”布兰道，“我们扑杀一头鹿，还赶走想来偷吃的树猫。”那猫体毛棕褐，只有冰原狼一半大，却十分凶猛。他还记得它身上的麝香味道，记得它趴在橡树枝干上低头咆哮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Three days," said Jojen. The boy had come up softfoot, or perhaps he had been there all along; in this blind black world, Bran could not have said. "We were afraid for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“整整三天，”玖健道。不知男孩刚轻手轻脚地赶到，还是一直便在旁边；在这黑暗迟钝的世界里，布兰什么也不能确定。“我们都为你担心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered who he was all too well; Bran the boy, Bran the broken. Better Bran the beastling. Was it any wonder he would sooner dream his Summer dreams, his wolf dreams? Here in the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened. He could reach Summer whenever he wanted, and once he had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon. Though maybe he had only dreamed that. He could not understand why Jojen was always trying to pull him back now. Bran used the strength of his arms to squirm to a sitting position. "I have to tell Osha what I saw. Is she here? Where did she go?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怎不记得自己的身份？他太清楚了：小男孩布兰，残废的布兰。倒不如当凶兽布兰。这教他怎不思念夏天，怎不想做狼梦呢？在这阴冷潮湿的漆黑墓窖，他的第三只眼终于睁开。而今他随时能连接夏天，甚至触碰过白灵，并透过他与琼恩对话——不过或许那只是梦罢！他不明白玖健干嘛老急着把他拉回来。布兰用双手撑起身子，蠕动坐定。“我得把看见的情形告诉欧莎。她在这里吗？她上哪儿去了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wildling woman herself gave answer. "Nowhere, m'lord. I've had my fill o' blundering in the black." He heard the scrape of a heel on stone, turned his head toward the sound, but saw nothing. He thought he could smell her, but he wasn't sure. All of them stank alike, and he did not have Summer's nose to tell one from the other. "Last night I pissed on a king's foot," Osha went on. "Might be it was morning, who can say? I was sleeping, but now I'm not." They all slept a lot, not only Bran. There was nothing else to do, Sleep and eat and sleep again, and sometimes talk a little… but not too much, and only in whispers, just to be safe. Osha might have liked it better if they had never talked at all, but there was no way to quiet Rickon, or to stop Hodor from muttering, "Hodor, hodor, hodor," endlessly to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女野人出声答道：“我在。大人，这里黑黑的，什么都不方便。”他听见脚跟与石地板的摩擦，便转头看去，一无所获。无妨，闻得出来。转念间，他想起自己没了夏天的鼻子，众人都是一样的味道。“昨晚我尿在那个国王腿上，”欧莎说，“也可能是早晨，谁知道？我睡着了，刚刚醒。”大家和布兰一样，通常都在睡，这里无事可做，只有睡了吃，吃了睡，间或交流几句…却不敢多说，更不敢大声，只为确保安全。欧莎认为大家最好一句话都别说，但安抚瑞肯谈何容易，阿多的呢喃也无法阻止。“阿多，阿多，阿多，”他总是自言自语，说个不休。">查看中文翻译</div>

Bran had to squint as the pitch began to burn, filling the world with orange glare. The light woke Rickon, who sat up yawning.</div>

<div class="line_en">Osha carried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other. A naked sword hung down her back, one of the last to bear Mikken's mark. He had forged it for Lord Eddard's tomb, to keep his ghost at rest. But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the armory, good steel had been hard to resist, even if it meant grave-robbing. Meera had claimed Lord Rickard's blade, though she complained that it was too heavy. Brandon took his namesake's, the sword made for the uncle he had never known. He knew he would not be much use in a fight, but even so the blade felt good in his hand.</div>

Jorah and jonos, Brandon the Bad, Walton the Moon King, Edderion the Bridegroom, Eyron, Benjen the Sweet and Benjen the Bitter, King Edrick Snowbeard. Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done terrible things, but they were Starks every one, and Bran knew all their tales. He had never feared the crypts; they were part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he would lie here too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran had told himself a hundred times how much he hated hiding down here in the dark, how much he wanted to see the sun again, to ride his horse through wind and rain. But now that the moment was upon him, he was afraid. He'd felt safe in the darkness; when you could not even find your own hand in front of your face, it was easy to believe that no enemies could ever find you either. And the stone lords had given him courage. Even when he could not see them, he had known they were there.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed a long while before they heard anything again. Bran had begun to fear that something had happened to Osha. His brother was squirming restlessly. "I want to go home!" he said loudly. Hodor bobbed his head and said, "Hodor." Then they heard the footsteps again, growing louder, and after a few minutes Osba emerged into the light, looking grim. "Something is blocking the door. I can't move it."</div>

<div class="line_en">The door to the crypts was made of ironwood. It was old and heavy, and lay at a slant to the ground. Only one person could approach it at a time. Osha tried once more when she reached it, but Bran could see that it was not budging. "Let Hodor try."</div>

<div class="line_en">They had to pull Bran from his basket first, so he would not get squished. Meera squatted beside him on the steps, one arm thrown protectively across his shoulders, as Osha and Hodor traded places. "Open the door, Hodor," Bran said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Turning, Hodor put his back to the wood and shoved. Again. Again. "Hodor!" He put one foot on a higher step so he was bent under the slant of the door and tried to rise. This time the wood groaned and creaked. "Hodor!" The other foot came up a step, and Hodor spread his legs apart, braced, and straightened. His face turned red, and Bran could see cords in his neck bulging as he strained against the weight above him. "Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor HODOR!" From above came a dull rumble. Then suddenly the door jerked upward and a shaft of daylight fell across Bran's face, blinding him for a moment. Another shove brought the sound of shifting stone, and then the way was open. Osha poked her spear through and slid out after it, and Rickon squirmed through Meera's legs to follow. Hodor shoved the door open all the way and stepped to the surface. The Reeds had to carry Bran up the last few steps.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sky was a pale grey, and smoke eddied all around them. They stood in the shadow of the First Keep, or what remained of it. One whole side of the building had torn loose and fallen away. Stone and shattered gargoyles lay strewn across the yard. They fell just where I did, Bran thought when he saw them. Some of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces it made him wonder how he was alive at all. Nearby some crows were pecking at a body crushed beneath the tumbled stone, but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took the rest of the morning to make a slow circuit of the castle. The great granite walls remained, blackened here and there by fire but otherwise untouched. But within, all was death and destruction. The doors of the Great Hall were charred and smoldering, and inside the rafters had given way and the whole roof had crashed down onto the floor. The green and yellow panes of the glass gardens were all in shards, the trees and fruits and flowers torn up or left exposed to die. Of the stables, made of wood and thatch, nothing remained but ashes, embers, and dead horses. Bran thought of his Dancer, and wanted to weep. There was a shallow steaming lake beneath the Library Tower, and hot water gushing from a crack in its side. The bridge between the Bell Tower and the rookery had collapsed into the yard below, and Maester Luwin's turret was gone. They saw a dull red glow shining up through the narrow cellar windows beneath the Great Keep, and a second fire still burning in one of the storehouses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨剩下的时间里，他们绕着城堡仔细转了一圈。雄伟的大理石城墙仍旧健在，虽多处焦黑，但并未垮塌。墙内成了死亡和毁灭的展台。厅门化为焦炭，房椽消失无影，天花板压坠在地。玻璃花园的绿黄窗格全部粉碎，其中的树木、瓜果和鲜花要么断裂夭折，要么无遮无盖。茅草和木料盖的马厩荡然无存，故地只余灰烬、碎屑和马尸。布兰想起小舞，忍不住落泪。藏书塔下出现一个蒸汽腾腾的浅池，热水正从塔中裂口喷涌而出。连接钟楼和鸦巢的桥梁垮进下方庭院，钟楼旁鲁温师傅居住的塔楼也不见了。他们看见主堡下方的地窖窄窗内闪烁着阴暗的红光，某座库房的火势也未平息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two lean dark shapes emerged from behind the broken tower, padding slowly through the rubble. Rickon gave a happy shout of "Shaggy!" and the black direwolf came bounding toward him. Summer advanced more slowly, rubbed his head up against Bran's arm, and licked his face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Osha called softly through the blowing smoke as they went, but no one answered. They saw one dog worrying at a corpse, but he ran when he caught the scents of the direwolves; the rest had been slain in the kennels. The maester's ravens were paying court to some of the corpses, while the crows from the broken tower attended others. Bran recognized Poxy Tym, even though someone had taken an axe to his face. One charred corpse, outside the ashen shell of Mother's sept, sat with his arms drawn up and his hands balled into hard black fists, as if to punch anyone who dared approach him. "If the gods are good," Osha said in a low angry voice, "the Others will take them that did this work."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jojen and Meera led Rickon out between them. Hodor followed. Low branches whipped at Bran's face as they pushed between the trees, and the leaves brushed away his tears. Osha joined them in the yard a few moments later. She said no word of Maester Luwin. "Hodor must stay with Bran, to be his legs," the wildling woman said briskly. "I will take Rickon with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玖健和梅拉牵走瑞肯。阿多随后。他们穿过树林，低枝抽打布兰的脸庞，树叶则抹去他层层泪花。不一会儿，欧莎回到院子与他们会合，再没提起鲁温师傅。“阿多跟布兰一起，当他的双腿。”女野人明快地说，“我来保护瑞肯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye, I thought you might," said Osha. "Believe I'll try the East Gate, and follow the kingsroad a ways."</div>

<div class="line_en">They stopped at the kitchens first. Osha found some loaves of burned bread that were still edible, and even a cold roast fowl that she ripped in half. Meera unearthed a crock of honey and a big sack of apples. Outside, they made their farewells. Rickon sobbed and clung to Hodor's leg until Osha gave him a smack with the butt end of her spear. Then he followed her quick enough. Shaggydog stalked after them. The last Bran saw of them was the direwolf's tail as it vanished behind the broken tower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家去了厨房一趟。欧莎找到好几条虽然烤焦但勉强可食用的面包，甚至还有一只冷掉的烤鸭，她把它分成两半。梅拉掘出一坛蜂蜜和一大袋苹果。准备完毕后，他们互道珍重。瑞肯哭了，抱住阿多的腿不放手，直到欧莎用矛柄轻轻拍他，这才快步跟上。毛毛狗跟着弟弟。布兰目送他们远去，直到冰原狼的尾巴消失在残塔之后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the edge of the wolfswood, Bran turned in his basket for one last glimpse of the castle that had been his life. Wisps of smoke still rose into the grey sky, but no more than might have risen from Winterfell's chimneys on a cold autumn afternoon. Soot stains marked some of the arrow loops, and here and there a crack or a missing merlon could be seen in the curtain wall, but it seemed little enough from this distance. Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers still stood as they had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been sacked and burned at all. The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I'm not dead either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进入狼林之前，布兰在篮子上回头，朝这座他生活了一辈子的城堡瞥了最后一眼。缕缕清烟继续爬上灰色长空，和清冷的秋日午后临冬城炊烟缭绕的情景并无二致。外墙箭孔有的被熏黑，不少城垛开裂塌落，但从远观之，城堡依旧是那般模样。高墙之后，堡垒和塔楼傲然耸立，一如千百年的沧桑岁月，劫掠和焚烧无法侵袭。好坚强的石头，布兰告诉自己，树木的根扎进地底，那里有冬境之王的宝座，是他们给了它力量。只要他们存在，临冬城便会不朽。它没有死，只是残破，和我一样，他想，我也没有死。">查看中文翻译</div>
