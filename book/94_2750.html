<div class="line_en">There are storytellers in the Land-of-Almost-Awake who say we all have an inner voice, whispering to us what we must do, and all we must do is listen.

Granny never liked proper psychology. Though she really did try with the woman in the black skirt.</div>

<div class="line_en">People in the real world always say, when something terrible happens, that the sadness and loss and aching pain of the heart will "lessen as time passes," but it isn't true. Sorrow and loss are constant, but if we all had to go through our whole lives carrying them the whole time, we wouldn't be able to stand it. The sadness would paralyze us. So in the end we just pack it into bags and find somewhere to leave it.</div>

The houses are so beautiful that, to be on the safe side, you have to be sitting down when you look at them. But no one lives there, they are only used for storage.

<div class="line_en">Miploris used to be the smallest kingdom in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, but after the War-Without-End it became the biggest. That was why Granny didn't like riding there, because so many of the storehouses had her name on signs outside. And in Miploris people talk of inner voices, Elsa remembers now. Miplorisians believe that the inner voices are those of the dead, coming back to help their loved ones.</div>

"Bureaucratic bastards" was what Granny called the Miplorisians, because of all the forms that have to be filled out nowadays by whoever is dropping off some sorrow or other.

<div class="line_en">Elsa sits at the far end of the wooden pew at the front of the chapel, staring down into the floor until the mumbling dies down. The church is so packed that people are standing all along the walls. Many of them have insanely weird clothes, as if they've been playing outfit roulette with someone who can't read washing instruction tags.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎坐在祈祷室前方一排木长椅的尽头，盯着地板，直到窃窃私语声消失。教堂非常拥挤，墙边都站着人。他们中很多人穿着奇怪的衣服，就好像他们刚和看不懂洗涤说明标签的人一起玩了局换装轮盘赌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa will put "outfit roulette" in the word jar, she thinks. She tries to focus on that thought. But she hears languages she can't understand, and she hears her name being squeezed into strange pronunciations, and this takes her back to reality. She sees strangers pointing at her, with varying degrees of discretion. She understands that they all know who she is, and it makes her mad, so that when she glimpses a familiar face along one of the walls she has trouble placing him at first. Like when you see a celebrity in a café and instinctively burst out,"Oh, hi there!" before you realize that your brain has had time to tell you, "Hey, that's probably someone you know, say hi!" but not, "No, wait, it's just that guy from the TV!" Because your brain likes to make you look like an idiot.</div>

Some of them do so in other languages and have a little lady who translates into another microphone. But no one says "dead." Everyone just says that Granny has "passed away" or that they've "lost her." As if she's a sock that's been lost in the tumble-dryer. A few of them are crying, but she doesn't think they have the right.

She hears another voice beside the first, slurring and stumbling over its words as if it's put on its shoes the wrong way round. Both of the voices seem to be picking up speed as they come towards her. Realizing the danger, she's on her feet and running in a fluid movement. They follow. It dawns on her with sudden despair that the winter gloom is making everything look the same in the park, and she doesn't know the way out.

<div class="line_en">Wolfheart stares down at her. She stares back, lying in his arms. Her consciousness seems to float off. If it wasn't for the realization, in some part of her inner self, that there aren't enough paper bags in the whole world to breathe into if she dribbles on Wolfheart in her sleep, she would probably have gone to sleep there and then. So she struggles to stay awake and, after all, it would be a bit impolite to go to sleep now that he's saved her. Again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狼心盯着她。她躺在他的怀里，盯回去，意识似乎飘走了。如果不是因为她内心的某一部分还尚存理智，她大概当场就睡着了。如果她睡觉时在狼心身上流了口水，那估计呼吸机都不够帮助他喘气的了。所以她挣扎着保持清醒，现在睡着有点儿不礼貌，毕竟他救了她。又一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
