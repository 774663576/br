<div class="line_en">With Agnes's encouragement I felt much stronger, and no longer depressed. My life now bad a purpose. I intended to work as hard as I could, to help my aunt and to earn enough money to marry Dora. I got up every morning at five o'clock, walked to Dr Strong's house on the other side of London, worked with him for two hours every morning, and then walked back to Mr Spenlow's office, where I spent most of the day in the law courts. Then I returned to Dr Strong's for two or three more hours in the evening, and finally came home to my flat, where my aunt, Peggotty and Mr Dick would be waiting for me. I was glad to be able to tell my aunt that Dr Strong would pay me seventy pounds a year for my work. With that, and the rent from my aunt's house in Kent, we could live quite well, if we were careful. Because I was young and healthy, I did not mind hard work, and whenever I was tired, I told myself, "You're doing it for Dora!" and that made me work even harder.</div>

We had tea, and she sang her French songs to me, and played the guitar. We were happy again, until the moment when I stupidly mentioned that I had to get up at five o'clock the next morning. Suddenly her pretty face looked sad, and she did not play or sing again. When I got up to go, she came up close to me, and said lovingly, "You bad boy, don't be so silly!

<div class="line_en">"Ah, Agnes!" I said. "I've missed you so much recently! You helped me such a lot in the old days that I suppose I never learnt to think for myself. I always feel I need your help and advice. I get into such trouble, and I get so worried, and have so little confidence in myself, but when I'm with you, you give me purpose! You make me strong! What is your secret, my dear adopted sister?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day, Mrs Heep did not leave Agnes and me alone even for a minute. The Heeps, mother and son, seemed to me like two ugly great black birds hanging over the house, and they made me so uncomfortable that I went out for a walk in the afternoon. I was walking along a path near the house, wondering if I should warn Agnes about Uriah's plan of marriage, when I heard footsteps behind me, and turned to see Uriah himself running after me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，希普太太没给阿格尼斯和我留下片刻单独在一起的时间。这希普母子，在我看来，就像是徘徊在房子里的两只丑陋的大黑鸟，他们使我感到十分不舒服，所以到了下午，我就独自走出去散步。我沿着房子附近的一条小道走着，捉摸着我是否应该告诉阿格尼斯尤赖亚的结婚计划，这时我听见身后的脚步声，转身看见尤赖亚自己跑来追我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Agnes gave me her hand, which I kissed, and she went on, in her sisterly way, to listen sympathetically as I told her everything that had happened in the past few weeks. As usual, she knew the right thing to do. She advised me to write to Dora's aunts, to ask if I could visit Dora occasionally, and she encouraged me in my hopes of marriage. I felt again that peace which Agnes always brought to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had not been sitting together long when Mrs Heep came in. She did not leave us for a moment all that evening, and I wondered whether Uriah had told her to watch over us. Whenever I looked at Agnes's lovely face, I saw Mrs Heep's evil black eyes staring at me.</div>

That evening after dinner, when Agnes and Mrs Heep had left us, Uriah said to Mr Wickfield, "Let's have some wine, partner, and drink to young Mr Copperfield's health.

<div class="line_en">I knew Uriah was deliberately encouraging Mr Wickfield to drink too much, but I saw that although Agnes's father was aware of his weakness, he could no longer stop himself.
