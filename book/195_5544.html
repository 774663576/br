<div class="line_en">Philip arrived at Victoria Station nearly half an hour before the time which Mildred had appointed, and sat down in the second-class waiting-room. He waited and she did not come. He began to grow anxious, and walked into the station watching the incoming suburban trains; the hour which she had fixed passed, and still there was no sign of her. Philip was impatient. He went into the other waiting-rooms and looked at the people sitting in them. Suddenly his heart gave a great thud.</div>

<div class="line_en">She gave Philip a smile. She had taken off her cloak; and he saw that she wore a pale blue dress, cut square at the neck; and her hair was more elaborately arranged than ever. He had ordered champagne and when it came her eyes sparkled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她朝菲利普一笑，脱下外套，露出里面的浅蓝色方领连衣裙，头发梳理得比往日更加细致。菲利普点了瓶香槟。酒一上桌，她的眼睛都发亮了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She spoke ungraciously. She was put out by being kept waiting and answered Philip's attempt at conversation with monosyllables. She wore a long cloak of some rough, dark material and a crochet shawl over her head. They reached the restaurant and sat down at a table. She looked round with satisfaction. The red shades to the candles on the tables, the gold of the decorations, the looking-glasses, lent the room a sumptuous air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米尔德里德语气很冲。等了这么久已经让她很烦躁，菲利普想和她说话，她也只是“嗯啊”应付两声。她穿件料子粗硬的深色大衣，头上围块钩针披肩。到饭店坐下后，她四下看看，一脸满意。桌上的蜡烛发出幽幽红光，屋里装饰得金光闪闪，墙上的镜子也擦得锃光瓦亮，看上去特别高档。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because I've ordered fiz?" he asked carelessly, as though he never drank anything else.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was surprised when you asked me to do a theatre with you." Conversation did not go very easily, for she did not seem to have much to say; and Philip was nervously conscious that he was not amusing her. She listened carelessly to his remarks, with her eyes on other diners, and made no pretence that she was interested in him. He made one or two little jokes, but she took them quite seriously. The only sign of vivacity he got was when he spoke of the other girls in the shop; she could not bear the manageress and told him all her misdeeds at length.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你请我来看戏，真把我吓了一跳。”气氛很尴尬，对话难以进行。米尔德里德没什么好说的，菲利普也紧张地发现自己难博美人一笑。她的心显然没有放在菲利普身上，眼睛早飘到别桌客人上去了。她对菲利普一点兴趣都没有，连装都懒得装。菲利普说了一两句俏皮话，她只满脸严肃，无动于衷。只有谈起店里的其他女孩时，她才稍微活跃一点。她觉得茶馆的经理实在让人无法忍受，把她的丑事一件件都说给菲利普听了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I happen to know that she's not above going to Eastbourne with a man for the week-end now and again. One of the girls has a married sister who goes there with her husband, and she's seen her. She was staying at the same boarding-house, and she 'ad a wedding-ring on, and I know for one she's not married."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事儿啊？”菲利普问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip filled her glass, hoping that champagne would make her more affable; he was anxious that his little jaunt should be a success. He noticed that she held her knife as though it were a pen-holder, and when she drank protruded her little finger. He started several topics of conversation, but he could get little out of her, and he remembered with irritation that he had seen her talking nineteen to the dozen and laughing with the German. They finished dinner and went to the play. Philip was a very cultured young man, and he looked upon musical comedy with scorn. He thought the jokes vulgar and the melodies obvious; it seemed to him that they did these things much better in France; but Mildred enjoyed herself thoroughly; she laughed till her sides ached, looking at Philip now and then when something tickled her to exchange a glance of pleasure; and she applauded rapturously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普给米尔德里德倒满酒，希望香槟能让她温柔一些，也想让今晚的约会大获成功。她拿餐刀的样子就像握笔，举起酒杯时还翘着小拇指。菲利普聊了好几个话题，可她就是不肯透露自己的一点信息。他有些懊恼，因为她和那个德国佬在一块的时候可是说笑个不停呢。饭后他们去了剧院。菲利普是个很有修养的人，对滑稽的音乐剧向来不屑。不过是些恶俗的段子和肤浅的旋律罢了，他在法国看的要比这个好不知道多少倍。米尔德里德倒是津津有味，乐得花枝乱颤，一有好笑的地方她就和菲利普互瞅一眼，使出吃奶的劲儿把手都拍红。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he lay in bed he seemed still to see her sitting in the corner of the railway carriage, with the white crochet shawl over her head. He did not know how he was to get through the hours that must pass before his eyes rested on her again. He thought drowsily of her thin face, with its delicate features, and the greenish pallor of her skin. He was not happy with her, but he was unhappy away from her. He wanted to sit by her side and look at her, he wanted to touch her, he wanted… the thought came to him and he did not finish it, suddenly he grew wide awake… he wanted to kiss the thin, pale mouth with its narrow lips. The truth came to him at last. He was in love with her. It was incredible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="躺在床上的时候，仿佛又看到她坐在火车一隅，头上围着那条白色的钩针披肩。见不到她的这些钟头要怎么才能熬过去。他迷迷糊糊地想起她纤瘦的脸庞、细致俏媚的眉眼和泛着淡淡青色的肌肤。他同她在一起时并不幸福，但不同她在一起时又悲伤不已。他想坐在她身边，他想看着她、抚摸她，他想……他陷入遐想停不下来，夜越深越没有睡意，他想把嘴印在那对薄薄的、苍白的娇唇上——他终于明白过来，自己已经爱上了她。这感觉真是难以言语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had often thought of falling in love, and there was one scene which he had pictured to himself over and over again. He saw himself coming into a ball-room; his eyes fell on a little group of men and women talking; and one of the women turned round. Her eyes fell upon him, and he knew that the gasp in his throat was in her throat too. He stood quite still. She was tall and dark and beautiful with eyes like the night; she was dressed in white, and in her black hair shone diamonds; they stared at one another, forgetting that people surrounded them. He went straight up to her, and she moved a little towards him. Both felt that the formality of introduction was out of place. He spoke to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought of this old fancy of his, and it seemed impossible that he should be in love with Mildred Rogers. Her name was grotesque. He did not think her pretty; he hated the thinness of her, only that evening he had noticed how the bones of her chest stood out in evening-dress; he went over her features one by one; he did not like her mouth, and the unhealthiness of her colour vaguely repelled him. She was common. Her phrases, so bald and few, constantly repeated, showed the emptiness of her mind; he recalled her vulgar little laugh at the jokes of the musical comedy; and he remembered the little finger carefully extended when she held her glass to her mouth; her manners like her conversation, were odiously genteel. He remembered her insolence; sometimes he had felt inclined to box her ears; and suddenly, he knew not why, perhaps it was the thought of hitting her or the recollection of her tiny, beautiful ears, he was seized by an uprush of emotion. He yearned for her. He thought of taking her in his arms, the thin, fragile body, and kissing her pale mouth: he wanted to pass his fingers down the slightly greenish cheeks. He wanted her.</div>

He tried to think when it had first come to him. He did not know. He only remembered that each time he had gone into the shop, after the first two or three times, it had been with a little feeling in the heart that was pain; and he remembered that when she spoke to him he felt curiously breathless. When she left him it was wretchedness, and when she came to him again it was despair.</div>
