<div class="line_en">Indeed, he almost knocked her easel over, coming down upon her with his hands waving shouting out, "Boldly we rode and well," but, mercifully, he turned sharp, and rode off, to die gloriously she supposed upon the heights of Balaclava. Never was anybody at once so ridiculous and so alarming. But so long as he kept like that, waving, shouting, she was safe; he would not stand still and look at her picture. And that was what Lily Briscoe could not have endured. Even while she looked at the mass, at the line, at the colour, at Mrs Ramsay sitting in the window with James, she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep up, and suddenly she should find her picture looked at. But now, with all her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the colour of the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she was aware of someone coming out of the house, coming towards her; but somehow divined, from the footfall, William Bankes, so that though her brush quivered, she did not, as she would have done had it been Mr Tansley, Paul Rayley, Minta Doyle, or practically anybody else, turn her canvas upon the grass, but let it stand. William Bankes stood beside her.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had rooms in the village, and so, walking in, walking out, parting late on door-mats, had said little things about the soup, about the children, about one thing and another which made them allies; so that when he stood beside her now in his judicial way (he was old enough to be her father too, a botanist, a widower, smelling of soap, very scrupulous and clean) she just stood there. He just stood there. Her shoes were excellent, he observed. They allowed the toes their natural expansion. Lodging in the same house with her, he had noticed too, how orderly she was, up before breakfast and off to paint, he believed, alone: poor, presumably, and without the complexion or the allurement of Miss Doyle certainly, but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to that young lady. Now, for instance, when Ramsay bore down on them, shouting, gesticulating, Miss Briscoe, he felt certain, understood. Some one had blundered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Ramsay glared at them. He glared at them without seeming to see them. That did make them both vaguely uncomfortable. Together they had seen a thing they had not been meant to see. They had encroached upon a privacy. So, Lily thought, it was probably an excuse of his for moving, for getting out of earshot, that made Mr Bankes almost immediately say something about its being chilly and suggested taking a stroll. She would come, yes. But it was with difficulty that she took her eyes off her picture.</div>

<div class="line_en">The jacmanna was bright violet; the wall staring white. She would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the staring white, since she saw them like that, fashionable though it was, since Mr Paunceforte's visit, to see everything pale, elegant, semitransparent. Then beneath the colour there was the shape. She could see it all so clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment's flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child. Such she often felt herself -- struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage; to say: "But this is what I see; this is what I see," and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast, which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her. And it was then too, in that chill and windy way, as she began to paint, that there forced themselves upon her other things, her own inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for her father off the Brompton Road, and had much ado to control her impulse to fling herself (thank Heaven she had always resisted so far) at Mrs Ramsay's knee and say to her -- but what could one say to her? "I'm in love with you?" No, that was not true. "I'm in love with this all," waving her hand at the hedge, at the house, at the children. It was absurd, it was impossible. So now she laid her brushes neatly in the box, side by side, and said to William Bankes:</div>

<div class="line_en">"It suddenly gets cold. The sun seems to give less heat," she said, looking about her, for it was bright enough, the grass still a soft deep green, the house starred in its greenery with purple passion flowers, and rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue. But something moved, flashed, turned a silver wing in the air. It was September after all, the middle of September, and past six in the evening. So off they strolled down the garden in the usual direction, past the tennis lawn, past the pampas grass, to that break in the thick hedge, guarded by red hot pokers like brasiers of clear burning coal, between which the blue waters of the bay looked bluer than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“突然冷了起来，太阳好像没那么热了。”她说，一面环顾四周。天色还亮，草仍呈柔和的深绿色。房子在开放着紫色西番莲的绿叶丛中十分配目，白嘴鸦从高高的蓝天送下苍凉的啼声。但是什么东西在移动，一闪，银色的翼在空中一转。毕竟已是九月了，九月中旬了，已经过了晚上六点。因此他们按习惯的方向漫步走去，穿过花园，经过草地网球场，经过蒲苇丛，来到茂密的树篱的缺口处，卫士般守卫在那里的是俗称火红拨火棍的开花芦苇，像一盆盆熊熊燃烧的煤炭，穿过开花芦苇望去，海湾里碧蓝的海水显得分外地蓝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They came there regularly every evening drawn by some need. It was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had grown stagnant on dry land, and gave to their bodies even some sort of physical relief. First, the pulse of colour flooded the bay with blue, and the heart expanded with it and the body swam, only the next instant to be checked and chilled by the prickly blackness on the ruffled waves. Then, up behind the great black rock, almost every evening spurted irregularly, so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came, a fountain of white water; and then, while one waited for that, one watched, on the pale semicircular beach, wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly, a film of mother of pearl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好像为某种需要所吸引，他们每天傍晚都要到这里来。似乎在陆地上变得僵化停滞的思想，会被海水漂起重新启航。海水甚至给他们的身体带来某种生理上的轻松。首先，有节奏的拍击着的色彩把蓝色涌满了海湾，心胸随之开阔，身体也逐浪沉浮，只是紧接着凶恶暴躁的浪涛便打断了这一切，使人倍感扫兴。其次，从那块巨大的黑色岩石背后，几乎每晚都会有泉水喷出，因为喷出的时间没有规律，所以得注意等待，它喷的时候真是好看极了，一股白色的泉水。而当你等着的时候，会看到层层波浪一次又一次地在灰白的半圆形的海滩上平平地留下一层薄薄的珠母色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They both smiled, standing there. They both felt a common hilarity, excited by the moving waves; and then by the swift cutting race of a sailing boat, which, having sliced a curve in the bay, stopped; shivered; let its sails drop down; and then, with a natural instinct to complete the picture, after this swift movement, both of them looked at the dunes far away, and instead of merriment felt come over them some sadness -- because the thing was completed partly, and partly because distant views seem to outlast by a million years (Lily thought) the gazer and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们两个人站在那里，都笑了。他们感到同样的狂喜，先是因为涌动的波涛，后来是因为一艘破浪疾驶的帆船。帆船在海湾中划开一道弧线，停了下来，颠簸着，落下了帆。然后带着要使画面完整的自然本能，看过这—高速运动之后，两人便都把目光移到了远处的沙丘上。他们感到的不再是欢乐而是某种伤感——半是因为事情已经结束，半是因为这远处的景色似乎要比看景的人多活上一百万年（莉莉想道），并且当天空看着的还是一个沉睡的大地时，就已经和它进行交流了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking at the far sand hills, William Bankes thought of Ramsay: thought of a road in Westmorland, thought of Ramsay striding along a road by himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air. But this was suddenly interrupted, William Bankes remembered (and this must refer to some actual incident), by a hen, straddling her wings out in protection of a covey of little chicks, upon which Ramsay, stopping, pointed his stick and said "Pretty -- pretty," an odd illumination in to his heart, Bankes had thought it, which showed his simplicity, his sympathy with humble things; but it seemed to him as if their friendship had ceased, there, on that stretch of road. After that, Ramsay had married. After that, what with one thing and another, the pulp had gone out of their friendship. Whose fault it was he could not say, only, after a time, repetition had taken the place of newness. It was to repeat that they met. But in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes he maintained that his affection for Ramsay had in no way diminished; but there, like the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century, with the red fresh on his lips, was his friendship, in its acuteness and reality, laid up across the bay among the sandhills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="望着远处的沙丘，威廉·班克斯想起了拉姆齐：想起了威斯特摩兰的一条路，想起了拉姆齐独自行走在那条路上，一副似乎是天生的落寞神态。但是突然他被打断了，威廉·班克斯记得（这一定和某件实际发生过的事有关），是一只母鸡，张开了两只翅膀保护她那群小鸡，这时拉姆齐停了下来，用手杖指着说，“真漂亮——真漂亮”，当时班克斯认为这件事奇特地使人看到了拉姆齐的内心，表现了他的质朴，他对卑下事物的同情；但是他似乎觉得，就是在那里，在那条路上，仿佛他们的友谊停止了。那以后拉姆齐结了婚。再以后，由于这样那样的事情，他们的友谊失去了内涵。他也说不出来责任在谁，只是过了一段时期之后，他们的友谊中重复代替了新意，他们见面也正是重复旧谊。但是在和沙丘的这一无声交谈中，他坚持认为他对拉姆齐的感情没有任何减弱，而是仍旧在那里，就像一具年轻男人的尸体在泥炭中储放了一个世纪，嘴唇依然鲜红一样，他的强烈和真实的友谊储放在了海湾彼岸的沙丘之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and shrunk -- for Ramsay lived in a welter of children, whereas Bankes was childless and a widower -- he was anxious that Lily Briscoe should not disparage Ramsay (a great man in his own way) yet should understand how things stood between them. Begun long years ago, their friendship had petered out on a Westmorland road, where the hen spread her wings before her chicks; after which Ramsay had married, and their paths lying different ways, there had been, certainly for no one's fault, some tendency, when they met, to repeat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他为了这份友谊而感到忧虑不安，也许还为了从心头清除自己已经干瘪萎缩的自责——因为拉姆齐生活在一群活泼喧闹的孩子之中，而班克斯却无儿无女。是个鳏夫——他忧虑不安，希望莉莉·布里斯柯不要蔑视拉姆齐（一个有自己特点的伟大人物），而应理解他们之间的关系。他们多年以前开始的友谊在威斯特摩兰的一条小路上逐渐消失，在那儿那只母鸡张开翅膀保护她的小鸡；那以后拉姆齐结了婚，他们分道扬镳了，他们重逢时总有某种重复旧谊的倾向，这当然不是任何人的过错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes. That was it. He finished. He turned from the view. And, turning to walk back the other way, up the drive, Mr Bankes was alive to things which would not have struck him had not those sandhills revealed to him the body of his friendship lying with the red on its lips laid up in peat -- for instance, Cam, the little girl, Ramsay's youngest daughter. She was picking Sweet Alice on the bank. She was wild and fierce. She would not "give a flower to the gentleman" as the nursemaid told her. No! no! no! she would not! She clenched her fist. She stamped. And Mr Bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his friendship. He must have dried and shrunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，事情就是这样。他思考完毕。他转过身去不再看那片景色。他回身沿另外那条路走回去，上了车道，班克斯先生注意到了周围的事物，如果那些沙丘没有向他揭示出他的友谊之遗骸仍嘴唇鲜红地储放在泥炭之中，他是不会注意到这些的——比方说卡姆，那个小女孩，拉姆齐最小的女儿。她正在边坡上采香苜蓿花。她又任性又厉害，不肯按保姆说的“给这位先生一朵花”。不给！不给！不给！她就是不给！她紧攥着拳头。她跺脚。班克斯先生觉得自己老了，很悲哀，她不知怎的误会了他对她的友好。他想必是已经干瘪萎缩了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Ramsays were not rich, and it was a wonder how they managed to contrive it all. Eight children! To feed eight children on philosophy! Here was another of them, Jasper this time, strolling past, to have a shot at a bird, he said, nonchalantly, swinging Lily's hand like a pump-handle as he passed, which caused Mr Bankes to say, bitterly, how SHE was a favourite. There was education now to be considered (true, Mrs Ramsay had something of her own perhaps) let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those "great fellows," all well grown, angular, ruthless youngsters, must require. As for being sure which was which, or in what order they came, that was beyond him. He called them privately after the Kings and Queens of England; Cam the Wicked, James the Ruthless, Andrew the Just, Prue the Fair -- for Prue would have beauty, he thought, how could she help it?-- and Andrew brains. While he walked up the drive and Lily Briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed Ramsay's case, commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities. They gave him something -- William Bankes acknowledged that; it would have been pleasant if Cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered in eruption; but they had also, his old friends could not but feel, destroyed something. What would a stranger think now? What did this Lily Briscoe think? Could one help noticing that habits grew on him? eccentricities, weaknesses perhaps? It was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he did -- but that was too harsh a phrase -- could depend so much as he did upon people's praise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever she "thought of his work" she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table. It was Andrew's doing. She asked him what his father's books were about.

<div class="line_en">So now she always saw, when she thought of Mr Ramsay's work, a scrubbed kitchen table. It lodged now in the fork of a pear tree, for they had reached the orchard. And with a painful effort of concentration, she focused her mind, not upon the silver-bossed bark of the tree, or upon its fish-shaped leaves, but upon a phantom kitchen table, one of those scrubbed board tables, grained and knotted, whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity, which stuck there, its four legs in air. Naturally, if one's days were passed in this seeing of angular essences, this reducing of lovely evenings, with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four-legged table (and it was a mark of the finest minds to do so), naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Bankes liked her for bidding him "think of his work." He had thought of it, often and often. Times without number, he had said, "Ramsay is one of those men who do their best work before they are forty." He had made a definite contribution to philosophy in one little book when he was only five and twenty; what came after was more or less amplification, repetition. But the number of men who make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small, he said, pausing by the pear tree, well brushed, scrupulously exact, exquisitely judicial. Suddenly, as if the movement of his hand had released it, the load of her accumulated impressions of him tilted up, and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she felt about him. That was one sensation. Then up rose in a fume the essence of his being. That was another. She felt herself transfixed by the intensity of her perception; it was his severity; his goodness. I respect you (she addressed silently him in person) in every atom; you are not vain; you are entirely impersonal; you are finer than Mr Ramsay; you are the finest human being that I know; you have neither wife nor child (without any sexual feeling, she longed to cherish that loneliness), you live for science (involuntarily, sections of potatoes rose before her eyes); praise would be an insult to you; generous, pure-hearted, heroic man! But simultaneously, she remembered how he had brought a valet all the way up here; objected to dogs on chairs; would prose for hours (until Mr Ramsay slammed out of the room) about salt in vegetables and the iniquity of English cooks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="班克斯先生因为她嘱咐他“想想他写的书”而对她有了好感。他想过这一点，经常这样想。他曾无数次说道，“拉姆齐是那种四十岁前成就最辉煌的人中的一个。”他在只有二十五岁的时候所写的一本小书就对哲学作出了肯定的贡献；此后的作品便或多或少是进一步的发挥和重复。但是能对任何事物作出肯定的贡献的人的数目是很小的，他说道，在梨树旁停了下来，话说得十分得体、极其精确、异常公正。突然，似乎他手的一动释放出了她对他的所有感觉，使聚集在她心中的对他的大量印象如雪崩般倾泻而下。这是令人激动的感觉。然后他生命的精华在烟雾中升起。那是又—种感觉。她感到自己被如此强烈的感受惊呆了；是他的严厉；他的善良。我尊敬你（她在心中默默对他说），全身心地尊敬你；你不自负；完全不计较个人；你比拉姆齐先生更为优秀；你是我认识的最优秀的人；你既无妻室又无子女（她不带任何性情感地渴望去爱抚那孤独），你为科学而活着（她眼前不出自主地浮现出马铃薯的切片）；赞扬对你是种侮辱；慷慨宽厚、心灵纯洁、英勇崇高的人啊！但是同时她也想起，他如何把一个贴身男仆大老远地带到这里；反对狗上椅子；一连几个小时（直到拉姆齐先生把门一摔离去）絮絮叨叨地述说蔬菜里的盐分以及英国厨子有多坏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How then did it work out, all this? How did one judge people, think of them? How did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt or disliking? And to those words, what meaning attached, after all? Standing now, apparently transfixed, by the pear tree, impressions poured in upon her of those two men, and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks too quickly to be her own voice saying without prompting undeniable, everlasting, contradictory things, so that even the fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity. You have greatness, she continued, but Mr Ramsay has none of it. He is petty, selfish, vain, egotistical; he is spoilt; he is a tyrant; he wears Mrs Ramsay to death; but he has what you (she addressed Mr Bankes) have not; a fiery unworldliness; he knows nothing about trifles; he loves dogs and his children. He has eight. Mr Bankes has none. Did he not come down in two coats the other night and let Mrs Ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin? All of this danced up and down, like a company of gnats, each separate but all marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic net -- danced up and down in Lily's mind, in and about the branches of the pear tree, where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table, symbol of her profound respect for Mr Ramsay's mind, until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity; she felt released; a shot went off close at hand, and there came, flying from its fragments, frightened, effusive, tumultuous, a flock of starlings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么这一切又如何解释呢？一个人怎样判断别人，看待别人？怎样把这个那个因素加在一起得出结沦：你感觉到的是喜爱，或者是厌恶？话又说回来了，这些字究竟包含什么意义？现在她一副呆楞的样子站在梨树旁，对于这两个男人的印象源源不断涌上心头，要跟上她的思路就像要跟上一个说话快得无法用笔记录下来的声音，而这就是她自己的声音，滔滔地说着不容否认、永远存在、相互矛盾的事情，这样一来就连梨树皮上的裂纹和鼓包都不可改变地、永恒地固定在了那里。你具有崇高的品质，她继续在心中说道，但拉姆齐先生毫无这种品质；他偏狭、自私、虚荣、利己；他被宠坏了；他是个专横的家伙；他把拉姆齐夫人折腾得筋疲力尽；但是他有你（这话是对班克斯先生说的）所没有的东西：强烈的出世精神；对琐事一无所知；他爱狗和他的孩子们。他有八个孩子：你一个也没有。他那天晚上难道不是穿了两件上衣下来，让拉姆齐夫人给他理发，把头发剪到一只做布丁的盆子里吗？所有这些念头在莉莉的头脑中上下跳动，像一群蚊子，各自飞动，但又都奇异地被控制在一张无形的、具有弹性的网中——在梨树的技桠间跳动，技桠间仍旧悬着那张擦洗干净的厨桌的幻象，这是她对拉姆齐先生之智慧的极为尊敬的象征。直到她那越转越快的思绪因强度过大而爆裂，她才感到一阵轻松；一颗子弹从身旁不远处飞过，一群欧椋鸟躲避弹片，惊恐地叽喳着四散乱飞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His eyes, glazed with emotion, defiant with tragic intensity, met theirs for a second, and trembled on the verge of recognition; but then, raising his hand, half-way to his face as if to avert, to brush off, in an agony of peevish shame, their normal gaze, as if he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be inevitable, as if he impressed upon them his own child-like resentment of interruption, yet even in the moment of discovery was not to be routed utterly, but was determined to hold fast to something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which he was ashamed, but in which he revelled -- he turned abruptly, slammed his private door on them; and, Lily Briscoe and Mr Bankes, looking uneasily up into the sky, observed that the flock of starlings which Jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛因感情冲动而蒙上了一层薄翳，因强烈的悲剧意识而充满挑战性，他的目光和他们的刹那间相遇，在将近认出他们时微微颤抖着；但这时，在气恼羞怒的痛苦中他向脸部半抬起手，像是要避开、要擦去他们正常的注视，像是在乞求他们暂时抑制他明知必然会出现的情况，像是要使自己在被打断时产生的孩子般的怨恨在他们心中留下深刻的印象；但是即使在被撞见的瞬间他也不会被彻底击溃，而是决心牢牢抓住一些这美妙的情感，这使他感到羞愧同时又令他着迷的粗野的吟诵——他突然转过身去，砰的一声在他们面前关上了属于他个人的那扇门；这时莉莉·布里斯柯和班克斯先生拘束不安地拾头看着天空，看到刚才被贾斯珀用枪惊散的那群欧椋鸟已经落在了榆树梢上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jasper!" said Mr Bankes. They turned the way the starlings flew, over the terrace. Following the scatter of swift-flying birds in the sky they stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight into Mr Ramsay, who boomed tragically at them, "Some one had blundered!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贾斯珀！”班克斯先生喊道。他们转向欧椋鸟越过平台飞去的方向，目光尾随着散布天空的疾飞的鸟群，在穿过高高的树篱的缺口时一头撞上了拉姆齐先生，他悲剧性地对他们瓮声瓮气地说道，“有人闯祸了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
