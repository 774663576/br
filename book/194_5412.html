<div class="line_en">Warden Grouard was not about to take that on faith. I need backup! Trying his walkie-talkie again, he got only static. The entrance was still a good twenty yards behind him, and Grouard began backing up slowly, choosing to leave his gun trained on the man on the floor.

Knowing the guard would never actually shoot either of them, Sophie now turned her attention back to the matter at hand, scanning the entire area around one masterpiece in particular -- another Da Vinci.

<div class="line_en">Could that be it? Grabbing the left side of the carved wood frame, she pulled it toward her. The painting was large and the backing flexed as she swung it away from the wall.

<div class="line_cn" title="可能在画后面吗？她抓住油画木框，用力把画向自己身前拽。画很大，索菲将其从墙上掀起时，画布向前弯曲。索菲把头和肩膀都伸到了画布后面，举着紫外线灯审视画的背面。">查看中文翻译</div>
