<div class="line_cn" title="但是，就连赫敏也无法否认一个事实：马尔福肯定在干着什么勾当，并且斯内普是知道的。所以哈利觉得有充分理由说“我告诉过你”，这句话他已经跟罗恩说了好几遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il. s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利没找到机会跟韦斯莱先生谈，他每天都在部里工作得很晚，直到圣诞前夜。韦斯莱一家和客人们坐在客厅里，金妮把这间屋子装饰得五彩缤纷，花团锦簇，简直像发生过一块纸拉花的爆炸。只有弗雷德、乔治、哈利和罗恩知道圣诞树顶上的小天使其实是一个花园小地精。弗雷德在拔圣诞晚餐用的胡萝卜时被这个小地精咬了脚踝，于是它被施了昏迷咒，涂成了金色，塞进了一件小芭蕾舞裙，背上粘了对小翅膀，在树顶上对他们怒目而视。这是哈利见过的最丑的天使，长着土豆似的大秃脑袋，脚上还有毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这只是想象，因为他还没找到机会跟赫敏说他听到的事情。他回去之前她就从斯拉格霍恩的晚会上消失了，至少气愤的麦克拉根是这么说的。等他回到公共休息室，她已经睡觉去了。他第二天一大早就跟罗恩出发到陋居来了，只来得及说了句祝她圣诞快乐，并说放假回来后有非常重要的消息要告诉她。但他不太确定赫敏有没有听见，罗恩和拉文德正在他的后面用不说话的方式进行着告别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love," Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都得听韦斯莱夫人最喜欢的歌手塞蒂娜·沃贝克的圣诞广播，她的歌声从木头的大收音机中婉转流出。芙蓉似乎觉得塞蒂娜非常乏味，她在角落里大声说着话，韦斯莱夫人皱着眉头不停地用魔杖调整音量开头，使塞蒂娜唱得越来越响。在一首爵士味特别浓的曲子《一锅火热的爱》的掩护下，弗雷德、乔治跟金妮玩起了噼啪爆炸牌。罗恩的眼睛老是偷瞟比尔和芙蓉，好像想学点什么技巧。卢平显得特别憔悴，他坐在壁炉边，盯着炉火深处，仿佛听不见塞蒂娜的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，”斯克林杰说道，微微皱了皱眉头，“是的，也是因为这个，我们希望——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry," said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. "'The Chosen One,' you know… It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看到有你更多地参与，大家会受到鼓舞的，哈利，”斯克林杰说，他似乎对哈利这么快就领悟了他的话感到很欣慰，“救世之星，你明白……就是要给人希望，让人感到激动人心的事情在发生……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry," said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, "won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可如果我出入魔法部，”哈利说，仍然努力保持友好的语气，“不会让人觉得我赞成部里的做法吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. "I would not expect you to understand," he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. "These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯克林杰一时没说话，但脸色马上沉了下来。“我不指望你理解，”他说，但没能像哈利那样做到话语中不流露怒气，“现在形势危险，某些措施是必要的。你才十六岁——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be in Azkaban either," said Harry. "You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“邓布利多可远远不止十六岁，他也不赞成把斯坦·桑帕克关在阿兹卡班。”哈利说，“你把斯坦·桑帕克当成替罪羊，就像你想把我当成福神一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I don't think that'll work," said Harry pleasantly. "You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我想不行，”哈利彬彬有礼地说，“您知道，我不喜欢魔法部做的某些事情，比如关押斯坦·桑帕克。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison," said Harry, his temper rising now. "You're doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' working for you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，有人会说在把人关进监牢前先查明他是不是食死徒是你的义务。”哈利说，他的火气上来了，“你所做的跟巴蒂·克劳奇一样。你们从来都没做对过，是不是？要么是福吉，人在他眼皮底下被杀了还假装天下太平；要么就是你，关押无辜，还假装有救世之星为你工作！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, it was honest," said Harry. "One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，这很诚实，”哈利说，“是你对我说过的少数实话之一。你不关心我的死活，但你关心要我帮你使大家相信你在战胜伏地魔。我没忘记，部长……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, "I see. You prefer -- like your hero, Dumbledore -- to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You can try," said Harry indifferently. "But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore's still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可以试试，”哈利冷漠地说，“不过你看上去比福吉聪明，所以我以为你会吸取他的教训。他企图干涉霍格沃茨，你也许注意到他已经不是部长了，但邓布利多还是校长。如果我是你，就不去干涉邓布利多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
