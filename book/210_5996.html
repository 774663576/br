<div class="line_en">One evening at the end of May a middle-aged man was walking home from Shaston to the village of Marlott in the Vale of Blackmoor. His legs were thin and weak, and he could not walk in a straight line. He had an empty egg-basket on his arm, and his hat was old and worn. After a while he passed an elderly parson riding a grey horse.</div>

<div class="line_en">The parson rode nearer, and after a moment's hesitation, explained: "It was because I've discovered something of historical interest. I am Parson Tringham, the historian. Do you really not know, Durbeyfield, that you are a direct descendant of the ancient and noble family of the D'Urbervilles? They descended from Sir Pagan D'Urberville, who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror in 1066."</div>

<div class="line_en">The village of Marlott lies in the beautiful Vale of Blackmoor. Although this valley is only four hours away from London, it has not yet been discovered by tourists and artists. The best view of the vale is from the hills surrounding it; it looks like a map spread out. It is a quiet, sheltered part of the countryside, where the fields are always green and the rivers never dry up. To the south lies the great dividing line of hills. From here to the coast the hills are open, the sun pours down on the huge dry fields, the atmosphere is colourless. But here in the valley lies a completely different countryside, smaller and more delicate. The fields are tiny, the air makes you sleepy, the sky is of the deepest blue. Everywhere you can see a rich greenery of grass and trees, covering smaller hills and valleys. This is the Vale of Blackmoor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马勒特村位于美丽的黑荒野山谷。虽然山谷距伦敦只有四小时的路程，却尚未被游客和艺术家们发现。眺望山谷的最好视角是在环绕的山峦上；从那儿看过去，它宛如一幅平展的地图。这是一片峦嶂掩蔽的宁静乡村，田地总是郁郁葱葱的，溪流从不干涸。往南是耸立的山脉。由此往海岸去，山峦平缓开阔，阳光倾射在大片干涸的土地上，空气了无色彩。但在这里的山谷间，却是一派迥异的乡村景致，更小更精巧。田地不大，空气催人入梦，天空是最深最深的湛蓝。处处可见那树木草地的欲滴翠绿，覆盖了满山遍谷。这就是黑荒野山谷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And in the village of Marlott, following ancient custom, the young women gathered to dance every holiday. For this May- Day dance, all wore white dresses. There was a fine, handsome girl among them, with a red ribbon in her hair. As they danced, they noticed a carriage go by. Durbeyfield lay back in it, singing, "I'm -- Sir -- John -- and -- I've -- got -- a -- spoon -- and -- seal -- and -- my -- family -- lies -- at -- Kingsbere!" The girl with the ribbon, who was called Tess, turned red and said quickly to her friends, "Father's tired, that's all. " The other girls just laughed but stopped when Tess looked unhappy. The dancing went on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在马勒特村，遵从古老的习俗，每到假日，年轻妇女们都聚在一起跳舞。为这一次五月节，妇女们都身穿白衣裳。其中有一位纤秀好看的姑娘，头戴红色的发带。就在她们跳着舞时，她们看到一辆马车驰过。德北正仰身坐靠其中，唱道：“我是约翰爵士，我有银匙和印章，我的家庭埋在王陴那里。”那个头戴红发带、名叫苔丝的姑娘脸都涨红了，赶忙对伙伴们说：“父亲累了，就这么回事。”其他的姑娘全都大笑起来，但当她们察觉到苔丝的不悦时便停住了。舞会仍在继续进行着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the evening the men of the village came to watch and later to join the dancers. Three young strangers, who were passing by, also stopped to look. They explained they were brothers on a walking tour. The older two continued their walk, but the youngest seemed more interested in the girls than his brothers were, and stayed to dance with several of them. As he left the dance, he noticed Tess, who seemed a little sad that he had not chosen her. He looked back from the road, and could still see her in her white dress, standing modestly apart from the dancers. He wished he had danced with her. He wished he had asked her name. But it was too late. He hurried on to join his brothers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚，村里的男人们赶来观看，并跟着跳了起来。还有三个路过的陌生人也停下来看了一会儿。他们解释说，他们兄弟三人正在远足旅行的途中。后来两个哥哥继续赶路了，而老三似乎比哥哥们对姑娘更感兴趣。他待了会儿，并和几个姑娘跳了舞。就在他离开舞会时，他注意到了苔丝。她看起来有点儿伤心，因为他没有邀她跳舞。当他在路上回头张望时，仍能见到穿着一身白色衣裙的她，优雅端庄地站在一群跳舞者的旁边。他真希望自己当初请她跳了舞，还想问问她的芳名，但现在已经来不及了。他要尽快赶上他的哥哥们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young stranger had made an impression on Tess. But soon, worried by her father's strange appearance that afternoon, she decided to walk home. After the excitement of the dance, her parents'small cottage was a depressing sight. It was dark inside, as they had only one candle. The furniture was old and worn. There were six children crowded into the tiny space. Their mother was doing the washing at the same time as putting the baby to sleep. Looking after so many children had aged Joan Durbeyfield, but she still showed some of her early prettiness, which Tess had inherited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="陌生的年轻人给苔丝留下了印象，但很快苔丝想起了父亲下午古怪的模样，有些担心。于是她决定走回家去。她刚刚走出舞会，有些兴奋，她们家的小屋便显得有些抑郁。因为只有一根蜡烛，屋子里很昏暗。家具都是又旧又破的，还有六个孩子挤在这么一个小地方。苔丝的母亲一边在哄小宝宝入睡，一边洗着衣服。一个人要照料这么多孩子，这加速了琼·德北的衰老，但从她身上仍不难看出几分年轻时的姿色。苔丝承袭了母亲的美貌。">查看中文翻译</div>
