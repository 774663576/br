<div class="line_en">My name, in those days, was Susan Trinder. People called me Sue. I know the year I was born in, but for many years I did not know the date, and took my birthday at Christmas. I believe I am an orphan. My mother I know is dead. But I never saw her, she was nothing to me. I was Mrs Sucksby's child, if I was anyone's; and for father I had Mr Ibbs, who kept the locksmith's shop, at Lant Street, in the Borough, near to the Thames.</div>

<div class="line_en">This is the first time I remember thinking about the world and my place in it. There was a girl named Flora, who paid Mrs Sucksby a penny to take me begging at a play. People used to like to take me begging then, for the sake of my bright hair; and Flora being also very fair, she would pass me off as her sister. The theatre she took me to, on the night I am thinking of now, was the Surrey, St George's Circus. The play was Oliver Twist. I remember it as very terrible. I remember the tilt of the gallery, and the drop to the pit. I remember a drunken woman catching at the ribbons of my dress. I remember the flares, that made the stage very lurid; and the roaring of the actors, the shrieking of the crowd. They had one of the characters in a red wig and whiskers: I was certain he was a monkey in a coat, he capered so. Worse still was the snarling, pink-eyed dog; worst of all was that dog's master -- Bill Sykes, the fancy-man. When he struck the poor girl Nancy with his club, the people all down our row got up. There was a boot thrown at the stage. A woman beside me cried out, "Oh, you beast! You villain! And her worth forty of a bully like you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我第一次思考有关这个世界以及我在这个世界上的位置问题。第一次把我带去某个表演乞讨的是一个名叫弗洛娜的女孩子，作为报酬，她付给了莎克斯比太太一个便士。从那以后，人们都喜欢带着我去乞讨，因为我有漂亮的头发，就和弗洛娜一样，所以我们俩可以很轻易的装扮成一对姐妹。如果我没有记错的话，她那个晚上带我去的是圣乔治马戏团。演出的是雾都孤儿，那真是一场糟糕的表演，我现在能记住的有戏院走廊的顶棚以及正厅后排深陷的地方；一个喝醉的女人，总是想要抓住我衣服上的缎带；那些闪亮的灯光，把舞台照得异常惨白；还有演员的咆哮，观众的尖叫。表演中有个戴着红色假发和胡腮的角色，在我看来他就是一只穿着外衣的猴子，因为只有猴子才会那样地跳来跳去；更糟的是一支狂吠的，有着红眼睛的恶犬；还有那最糟糕的，狗的主人―比尔·塞克斯，一个吃软饭的情夫。当他拿着手杖殴打那可怜的女孩南西，坐在我们前排的所有人都愤怒地站了起来。而某人损失了自己的一支靴子—它被扔到了台上，而我身边的女人大声地喊道：“哦，你这禽兽，流氓，你算什么东西，四十个你这样的蠢货都配不上她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know if it was the people getting up -- which made the gallery seem to heave about; or the shrieking woman; or the sight of Nancy, lying perfectly pale and still at Bill Sykes's feet; but I became gripped by an awful terror. I thought we should all be killed. I began to scream, and Flora could not quiet me. And when the woman who had called out put her arms to me and smiled, I screamed out louder. Then Flora began to weep -- she was only twelve or thirteen, I suppose. She took me home, and Mrs Sucksby slapped her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道是什么让整个剧院显得如此的疯狂，也许是因为所有的人都站了起来，抑或那个尖叫的女人，或者是瘫软在比尔·塞克斯脚边可怜的南西；无论如何，这种气氛让我感到恐惧，当时我觉得我们所有人都要被杀死。我开始无法控制的尖叫，而弗洛娜对此无能为力。后来那个尖叫的女人抱住我，微笑着，但是那只是使我叫得更加的大声。再后来，弗洛娜也哭了，作为一个只有12,3岁的孩子她大概是被吓坏了。最后她还是把我带回了家，并且被莎克斯比太太打了耳光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What was you thinking of, taking her to such a thing?" she said. "You was to sit with her upon the steps. I don't hire my infants out to have them brought back like this, turned blue with screaming. What was you playing at?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是你想做的？把她弄成这样？”莎克斯比太太问道：“你应该照顾她。我不想让人把我的孩子雇出去然后回来时变成尖叫不止。你看她脸都蓝了，你到底在玩什么把戏？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took me upon her lap, and I wept again. "There now, my lamb," she said. Flora stood before her, saying nothing, pulling a strand of hair across her scarlet cheek. Mrs Sucksby was a devil with her dander up. She looked at Flora and tapped her slippered foot upon the rug, all the time rocking in her chair -- that was a great creaking wooden chair, that no-one sat in save her -- and beating her thick, hard hand upon my shaking back. Then,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莎克斯比太太一边斥责着弗洛娜，一边我把抱到她的腿上坐着，我又开始哭，她安慰道：“好了，乖乖。”弗洛娜沉默地坐在她的对面，只是不停的拉着她红红的脸颊旁的一缕头发。发火的时候莎克斯比太太就像是一个恶魔。她坐在她的个人专座——一把很棒的、吱吱作响的木头椅子，来回摇动着，盯着弗洛娜，穿着拖鞋的脚在地毯上有节奏敲打着，并且把一只手放在我颤抖的背上。">查看中文翻译</div>

But she put her fingers to a tear at the waist of her skirt, and reached inside it; and you might imagine my surprise when the tear turned out to be not a tear at all, but the neck of a little silk pocket that was sewn inside her gown. She brought out a black cloth bag, and a bottle with a stopper on a silver chain. The bag had threepence in it, and half a nutmeg. Perhaps she got it from the drunken woman who plucked at my dress. The bottle, with its stopper off, smelt of roses. Mrs Sucksby sniffed.</div>

<div class="line_en">She lifted my hair from about my neck and smoothed it across the pillow. My hair, as I have said, was very fair then -- though it grew plain brown, as I got older -- and Mrs Sucksby used to wash it with vinegar and comb it till it sparked.

<div class="line_cn" title="她拢起我脖子后的头发，把它们顺在枕头上。我说过，我的头发很漂亮，虽然在我成年之后它们变成了普通的褐色。莎克斯比太太总是用醋帮我洗，再刷到它发亮。这会儿她把我头发缕平，挑起一绺儿放在唇边。“要是弗洛娜再想带你去偷东西，你就跟我说——知道吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I said I would. "Good girl," she said. Then she went. She took her candle with her, but the door she left half-open, and the cloth at the window was of lace and let the street-lamps show. It was never quite dark there, and never quite still. On the floor above were a couple of rooms where girls and boys would now and then come to stay: they laughed and thumped about, dropped coins, and sometimes danced. Beyond the wall lay Mr Ibbs's sister, who was kept to her bed: she often woke with the horrors on her, shrieking. And all about the house -- laid top-to-toe in cradles, like sprats in boxes of salt -- were Mrs Sucksby's infants. They might start up whimpering or weeping any hour of the night, any little thing might set them off. Then Mrs Sucksby would go among them, dosing them from a bottle of gin, with a little silver spoon you could hear chink against the glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我答应了。再对我说“好姑娘”之后，她走出了我的房间。她带走了蜡烛，但是却让门半敞着，而且窗帘是蕾丝的，街上的灯光可以透进来。那里永远不会黑暗，也不会安静。楼上有几个房间会时常有男女留宿；他们整夜的嬉笑吵闹，扔硬币，有时还会跳舞。隔壁住的是埃比斯先生的姐姐，一个常年卧床不起的女人。她常常尖叫着在恐惧中惊醒。房子里到处都是莎克斯比太太的摇篮，婴儿们就像腌在盒子里的鲱鱼——头挨脚脚挨头的躺着。夜里的任何一个时候他们都有可能呜呜咽咽、抽抽啼啼，再小的动静都能惊动他们。这时候萨太太就会过去给每一个婴儿喂上一小匙杜松子酒，你能听到银匙和玻璃酒瓶相碰的叮当声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On this night, though, I think the rooms upstairs must have been empty, and Mr Ibbs's sister stayed quiet; and perhaps because of the quiet, the babies kept asleep. Being used to the noise, I lay awake. I lay and thought again of cruel Bill Sykes; and of Nancy, dead at his feet. From some house nearby there sounded a man's voice, cursing. Then a church bell struck the hour -- the chimes came queerly across the windy streets. I wondered if Flora's slapped cheek still hurt her. I wondered how near to the Borough was Clerkenwell; and how quick the way would seem, to a man with a stick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今晚，我想楼上的房间是空着的。埃比斯先生的姐姐也非常安静；也许是因为她的安静，那些婴儿也都安静的睡着。由于习惯了吵闹，在这种安静的时候，我反倒无法入眠。躺在床上，脑海里依然浮现出残忍的比尔·塞克斯，以及死在他脚下的南西。邻近的一个房子里想起了一个男人的声音，咒骂着什么。然后教堂的钟响了，怪异的钟声在风中传遍整个街道。我在想那些耳光是否依然让弗洛娜感到疼痛。我在想克勒肯夭尔到底离波柔有多远，以及一个拿着手杖的男人要用多久从那里达到这里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had a warm imagination, even then. When there came footsteps in Lant Street, that stopped outside the window; and when the footsteps were followed by the whining of a dog, the scratching of the dog's claws, the careful turning of the handle of our shop door, I started up off my pillow and might have screamed -- except that before I could the dog gave a bark, and the bark had a catch to it, that I thought I knew: it was not the pink-eyed monster from the theatre, but our own dog, Jack. He could fight like a brick. Then there came a whistle. Bill Sykes never whistled so sweet. The lips were Mr Ibbs's. He had been out for a hot meat pudding for his and Mrs Sucksby's supper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我兴奋地胡乱猜想着。直到有脚步声从兰特街传来，停在窗外；紧接着是一只狗在低嚎、狗爪刨地的声音，我听到店门的把手被轻轻转动的声音。我从床上跳起来，如果不是有人在狗吠的时候训了它一声，我可能会叫出声来。我才明白那不是剧院里的红眼妖怪，而是我们自家的狗，杰克。它很凶猛。接着传来一声口哨。比尔·塞克斯从不这么亲切地吹口哨。是埃比斯先生。他出门买新鲜的肉布丁作为自己和莎克斯比太太的晚餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

And I remember seeing -- what I had never seen before -- how the world was made up: that it had bad Bill Sykeses in it, and good Mr Ibbses; and Nancys, that might go either way.

<div class="line_en">I believe I learned my alphabet, like that: not by putting letters down, but by taking them out. I know I learned the look of my own name, from handkerchiefs that came, marked Susan. As for regular reading, we never troubled with it. Mrs Sucksby could do it, if she had to; Mr Ibbs could read, and even write; but, for the rest of us, it was an idea -- well, I should say, like speaking Hebrew or throwing somersaults: you could see the use of it, for Jews and tumblers; but while it was their lay, why make it yours?</div>

<div class="line_en">So I thought then, anyway. I learned to cipher, though. I learned it, from handling coins. Good coins we kept, of course. Bad ones come up too bright, and must be slummed, with blacking and grease, before you pass them on. I learned that, too. Silks and linens there are ways of washing and pressing, to make them seem new. Gems I would shine, with ordinary vinegar. Silver plate we ate our suppers off -- but only the once, because of the crests and stampings; and when we had finished, Mr Ibbs would take the cups and bowls and melt them into bars. He did the same with gold and pewter. He never took chances: that's what made him so good. Everything that came into our kitchen looking like one sort of thing, was made to leave it again looking quite another. And though it had come in the front way -- the shop way, the Lant Street way -- it left by another way, too. It left by the back. There was no street there. What there was, was a little covered passage and a small dark court. You might stand in that and think yourself baffled; there was a path, however, if you knew how to look. It took you to an alley, and that met a winding black lane, which ran to the arches of the railway line; and from one of those arches -- I won't say quite which, though I could -- led another, darker, lane that would take you, very quick and inconspicuous, to the river. We knew two or three men who kept boats there. All along that crooked way, indeed, lived pals of ours -- Mr Ibbs's nephews, say, that I called cousins. We could send poke from our kitchen, through any of them, to all the parts of London. We could pass anything, anything at all, at speeds which would astonish you. We could pass ice, in August, before a quarter of the block should have had a chance to turn to water. We could pass sunshine in summer -- Mr Ibbs would find a buyer for it.</div>

I think it must have been worse. I know she was hard as a nut, for she had you and, I swear, she never murmured -- never called out once. She only looked at you, and put a kiss on your little head; then she gave me six pounds for the keeping of you -- all of it in sovereigns, and all of 'em good.

I supposed it was a pity my mother had ended up hanged; but, since she was hanged, I was glad it was for something game, like murdering a miser over his plate, and not for something very wicked, like throttling a child.

<div class="line_en">A night in winter, a few weeks after the Christmas that marked my seventeenth birthday. A dark night -- a hard night, full of a fog that was more or less a rain, and a rain that was more or less snow. Dark nights are good to thieves and fencing-men; dark nights in winter are the best nights of all, for then regular people keep close to their homes, and the swells all keep to the country, and the grand houses of London are shut up and empty and pleading to be cracked. We got lots of stuff on nights like those, and Mr Ibbs's profits were higher than ever. The cold makes thieves come to a bargain very quick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个冬天的晚上，标志着我的生日的圣诞节后的几周，漆黑，浓雾，零星下着雨，还夹着点雪。盗贼和销赃人喜欢漆黑的夜晚；而冬季漆黑的夜晚是最好的，因为一般人都呆在家里，有头脸的人都回乡下呆着了，大房子全都关着门，空着，摆明招贼。在这样的夜晚里我们得到很多赃物，埃比斯先生得到比以往任何时候都高的利润。而且寒冷迫使盗贼很快成交。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We did not feel the cold too much at Lant Street, for besides our ordinary kitchen fire there was Mr Ibbs's locksmith's brazier: he always kept a flame beneath the coals of it, you could never say what might not turn up that would need making up or melting down. On this night there were three or four boys at it, sweating the gold off sovereigns. Besides them was Mrs Sucksby in her great chair, a couple of babies in a cradle at her side; and a boy and a girl who were rooming with us then -- John Vroom, and Dainty Warren.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在兰特街我们并不觉得有多冷，厨房里生着火，埃比斯先生的锁匠盆也没有消停过，常年燃着炭火。你永远都不知道在那里什么会被熔化，什么又会生成。在那个晚上，有三四个男孩在那里忙着把金币化成金子。莎克斯比太太依然坐在她的摇椅里，边上是一个装着两个婴儿的摇篮。还有一个男孩和一个女孩和我们同住——约翰·乌如和戴蒂·沃伦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He never cared for me. I think he was jealous. He had come to our house as a baby, like me; and like mine, his mother had died and made an orphan of him. But he was such a queer-looking child, no-one would take him off Mrs Sucksby's hands. She had kept him till he was four or five, then put him on the parish -- even then, however, he was a devil to get rid of, always running back from the workhouse: we were forever opening the shop-door and finding him sleeping on the step. She had got the master of a ship to take him at last, and he sailed as far as China; when he came back to the Borough after that, he did it with money, to brag. The money had lasted a month. Now he kept handy at Lant Street by doing jobs for Mr Ibbs; and besides them, ran mean little dodges of his own, with Dainty to help him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一直都不喜欢我。我想他是妒嫉。和我一样，还是一个孩子的时候他就来到了我们家；同样如我，他的母亲去世了，他是个孤儿。但是他看起来很古怪，没有人愿意领走他。莎克斯比太太只好把他养到四五岁，然后把他送到教会——可他就如同甩不掉的恶魔，总能从工厂跑回来；每次我们打开店门总能看见他睡在台阶上。最终，莎克斯比太太把他送上一条开往中国的船；回来的时候，他发了一笔小财，到处自吹自擂。但是他的钱一个月就花光了。现在他在兰特街给埃比斯先生帮点忙；除此之外，在戴蒂的帮助下做点小生意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was a great red-haired girl of three-and-twenty, and more or less a simpleton. She had neat white hands, though, and could sew like anything. John had her at this time stitching dog-skins onto stolen dogs, to make them seem handsomer breeds than what they really were.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was doing a deal with a dog-thief. This man had a couple of bitches: when the bitches came on heat he would walk the streets with them, tempting dogs away from their owners, then charging a ten pounds' ransom before he'd give them back. That works best with sporting dogs, and dogs with sentimental mistresses; some owners, however, will never pay up -- you could cut off their little dog's tail and post it to them and never see a bean, they are that heartless -- and the dogs that John's pal was landed with he would throttle, then sell to him at a knocked-down price. I can't say what John did with the meat -- passed it off as rabbit, perhaps, or ate it himself. But the skins, as I have said, he had Dainty stitching to plain street-dogs, which he was selling as quality breeds at the Whitechapel Market.</div>

She had the collar done and the shoulders and half the sleeves, and there were about forty different sorts of dog in it already.

<div class="line_en">"Ain't you hateful?" I would answer, keeping on with my own game. The pack was an old one, the cards as limp as rags. A man had been killed once, in a fight over a crooked game that was played with those cards. I set them out a final time and turned my chair a little, so that John might not see how they fell. And then, all at once, one of the babies started out of its slumber and began to cry, and Charley Wag woke up and gave a bark. There was a sudden gust of wind that made the fire leap high in the chimney, and the rain came harder upon the coals and made them hiss. Mrs Sucksby opened her eyes. "What's that?" she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不觉得自己很讨厌么？”我会回答，一边专注于我的游戏。这幅牌很旧，纸软的像破布。有个男人被打死了，就是因为用这幅牌出老千。我开始玩最后一把，并且把凳子转了转，这样约翰就看不到了。突然之间，有一个婴儿醒过来了，放声大哭。查里也醒了过来，放声大吠。一阵风吹过，烟筒里的火给窜起来，风夹着雨打湿了煤，弄的它们嘶嘶作响。“这是怎么了？”莎克斯比太太睁开眼问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then we heard it: a thump, in the passage that led to the back of the house. Then another thump came. Then the thumps became footsteps. The footsteps stopped at the kitchen door -- there was a second of silence -- and then, slow and heavy, a knock.</div>

<div class="line_en">So we all thought. We looked at one another, and Mrs Sucksby reached into the cradle to draw the baby from it and stop its cries against her bosom; and John took hold of Charley Wag and held his jaws shut. The boys at the brazier fell silent as mice. Mr Ibbs said quietly, "Anyone expected? Boys, put this lot away. Never mind your burning fingers. If it's the blues, we're done for."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们都想到了。大家你看着我，我看着你。莎克斯比太太跑到摇篮边，一把把婴儿按在怀里。约翰跑去按着查里的嘴巴，要它出不了声。火炉旁的男孩们安静的跟老鼠似的。埃比斯先生轻声说到“天知道是什么人，快把这些东西弄走，别管你那烧伤的手指了。如果那是警察，我们就完了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They began picking at the sovereigns and the gold they had sweated from them, wrapping them in handkerchiefs, putting the handkerchiefs beneath their hats or in their trouser pockets. One of them -- it was Mr Ibbs's oldest nephew, Phil -- went quickly to the door and stood beside it, his back flat to the wall, his hand in his coat. He had passed two terms in prison, and always swore he would not pass a third.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们马上开始收拾起金币什么的，用手帕包好，藏在帽子或是裤袋里。其中一男孩是埃比斯先生的大侄子，他叫费尔，他飞快的跑到门边，背贴墙站着，把手插在衣兜里。他已经蹲过2次监狱了，赌咒发誓说他再也不要去第3次。">查看中文翻译</div>

But it was only the wind that made the door swing: it came in a rush into the kitchen, blowing half the candles out, making the brazier spark, and sending all my playing-cards flying. In the passage stood a man, dressed dark, wet through and dripping, and with a leather bag at his feet. The dim light showed his pale cheeks, his whiskers, but his eyes were quite hidden in the shadow of his hat. I should not have known him if he had not spoken. He said, "Sue! Is it Sue? Thank God! I have come forty miles to see you. Will you keep me standing here? I am afraid the cold will kill me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看了看莎克斯比太太，她对我点了点头，我走过去抬起了门闩，门刷的一下就开了，差点打到我。费尔以为是有人撞开了它，在墙边直了直背，还打开了他的小刀。但其实门是给强风吹开的，蜡烛一半都给吹熄了，火盆也闪着火花，我的牌也给飞的到处都是。走道上站了一个男人，一身黑衣，全身湿透，水沿着衣服直往下滴，他的脚边还放着一个皮包。黑暗中隐约看到他苍白的下巴，带着胡茬，他的眼睛给帽子挡住了。要不是他开口叫我，我真认不出他，“苏！是你吗！谢谢上帝！我可是赶了40英里路来看你呀，你不会让我一直站在这，冻死为止吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

He kept his hair and whiskers long and now, the rain having taken the kink from them, they seemed longer than ever, and dark, and sleek. There were rings at his fingers, and a watch, with a jewel on the chain, at his waistcoat.

<div class="line_en">He could be quite the painter when he chose, and had done a little work in the forgery line, at Paris; when that fell through, I think he spent a year putting French books into English -- or English books into French -- anyway, putting them slightly different each time, and pinning different titles on them, and so making one old story pass as twenty brand-new ones. Mostly, however, he worked as a confidence-man, and as a sharper at the grand casinos -- for of course, he could mix with Society, and seem honest as the rest. The ladies especially would go quite wild for him. He had three times been nearly married to some rich heiress, but every time the father in the case had grown suspicious and the deal had fallen through. He had ruined many people by selling them stock from counterfeit banks. He was handsome as a plum, and Mrs Sucksby fairly doted on him. He came to Lant Street about once a year, bringing poke to Mr Ibbs, and picking up bad coin, cautions, and tips.</div>

He lives in a certain out-of-the-way sort of house, near a certain out-of-the-way kind of village, some miles from London -- never mind quite where, just now. He has a great room filled with books and prints, and cares for nothing but for them and for a work he is compiling -- let's call it, a dictionary. It is a dictionary of all his books; but he has hopes for the pictures, too -- has taken a mind to having them bound in fancy albums. The handling of that, however, is more than he can manage. He places a notice in a newspaper: he needs the services of -- here he put down another card, next to the first: Jack of Spades -- "a smart young man, to help him mount the collection; and one particular smart young man -- being at that time rather too well known at the London gaminghouses, and highly desirous of a little light out-of-the-way sort of employment, bed and board provided -- replies to the advertisement, is examined, and found fit."</div>

Now, I know enough in that line to fake my way; and she, in her innocence, can't tell a pastel from a pig. But she takes to her instruction -- oh, like anything.

I thought her a marvellous prude; it turns out she had the scarlet fever -- is at this moment dying of it, poor bitch. Now my lady has no chaperon but the housekeeper -- and the housekeeper is too busy to sit at lessons. The lessons, therefore, must end, the paints are left to dry upon their palette.

<div class="line_cn" title="“并不奇怪，”绅说，“只是我这样说，该死的。她是个很天真，很纯洁的姑娘，长期以来都与世隔绝。像你一样，她是个孤儿，但是没人会像萨克斯比太太对你那样对待她。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dainty looked at him then. Her mother had been a drunkard, and got drowned in the river. Her father had used to beat her. He beat her sister till she died. She said, in a whisper: "Ain't it terribly wicked, Gentleman, what you mean to do?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，戴蒂望向绅，戴蒂的妈妈是个酒鬼，后来醉倒淹死在河里，她的爸爸以前老是打她，她的姐姐就是被打死的。她低声说，“这岂不是太不道德了么，绅，你到底想干吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wicked?" he said. "Why, bless you, Dainty, of course it's wicked! But it's wicked to the tune of fifteen thousand pounds -- and oh! but that's a sweet tune, hum it how you will. Then again, do you suppose that when that money was first got, it was got honestly? Don't think it! Money never is. It is got, by families like hers, from the backs of the poor -- twenty backs broken for every shilling made. You have heard, have you, of Robin Hood?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不道德？”他说，“为什么，我的上帝，戴蒂，这当然是不道德的！但是这邪恶能给我们带来一万五千英镑——噢！想一想你们的未来吧，多美妙的事情啊。你们有没有想过第一桶金是怎么得到的，是老老实实挣来的么？千万别这么想！钱从来就不是能够那样得来的，而是她的家族从穷人的脊梁里——二十个破碎的脊梁中榨取来的每个先令所累积的。你有没有听说过罗宾汉？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Then again, I hoped they weren't: for, as I have said, I never was brave, but had got away with people supposing I was, for seventeen years.
