<div class="line_en">They rose; three ugly men, and ragged. One had a boil on his neck, and none had washed in half a year. The prospect of raising such to lordship amused her. I could seat them next to Margaery at feasts. When the chief fool undid the drawstring on the sack and plunged his hand inside, the smell of decay filled her audience chamber like some rank rose. The head he pulled out was grey-green and crawling with maggots. It smells like Father. Dorcas gasped, and Jocelyn covered her mouth and retched.</div>

If Father had known what she said to me, he would have had her tongue out. Cersei had never told anyone, though, not even Jaime.

<div class="line_en">"I have informers sniffing after the Imp everywhere, Your Grace," said Qyburn. He had garbed himself in something very like maester's robes, but white instead of grey, immaculate as the cloaks of the Kingsguard. Whorls of gold decorated his hem, sleeves, and stiff high collar, and a golden sash was tied about his waist. "Oldtown, Gulltown, Dorne, even the Free Cities. Wheresoever he might run, my whisperers will find him."</div>

Once the queen let it become known that Qyburn had taken the eunuch's place, the usual vermin had wasted no time in making themselves known to him, to trade their whispers for a few coins. It was the silver all along, not the Spider. Qyburn will serve us just as well. She was looking forward to the look on Pycelle's face when Qyburn took his seat.</div>

<div class="line_en">A knight of the Kingsguard was always posted outside the doors of the council chambers when the small council was in session. Today it was Ser Boros Blount. "Ser Boros," the queen said pleasantly, "you look quite grey this morning. Something you ate, perchance?" Jaime had made him the king's food taster. A tasty task, but shameful for a knight. Blount hated it. His sagging jowls quivered as he held the door for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="御前会议召开期间，总有一名御林铁卫在议事厅门口站岗。今天轮到柏洛斯·布劳恩爵士。“柏洛斯爵士，”太后和蔼地唤道，“你今天早晨气色不太好。吃出什么问题了吗？”詹姆让他当国王的品尝师，以防备毒药。这是个美味的任务，但对骑士而言意味着耻辱。布劳恩痛恨这点，开门时，他多肉的下巴微微发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soft, bald, and obsequious, Swyft had an absurd little white puff of beard where most men had a chin. The blue bantam rooster of his House was worked across the front of his plush yellow doublet in beads of lapis. Over that he wore a mantle of blue velvet decorated with a hundred golden hands. Ser Harys had been thrilled by his appointment, too dim to realize that he was more hostage than Hand. His daughter was her uncle's wife, and Kevan loved his chinless lady, flat-chested and chicken-legged as she was. So long as she had Ser Harys in hand, Kevan Lannister must needs think twice about opposing her. To be sure, a good-father is not the ideal hostage, but better a flimsy shield than none.</div>

A few have already joined up with his bastard son to help him clear the wretched ironmen from Moat Cailin and clear the way for Lord Bolton to return. Umber, Ryswell… I forget the other names. Even White Harbor is on the point of joining us. Its lord has agreed to marry both his granddaughters to our friends of Frey and open his port to our ships."</div>

"If he is dead, I suppose we will need to send Lord Manderly the heads of those who killed him, with our most sincere apologies."

<div class="line_en">"In any case," the queen went on, "Lord Eddard's younger daughter is with Lord Bolton, and will be wed to his son Ramsay as soon as Moat Cailin has fallen." So long as the girl played her role well enough to cement their claim to Winterfell, neither of the Boltons would much care that she was actually some steward's whelp tricked up by Littlefinger. "If the north must have a Stark, we'll give them one." She let Lord Merryweather fill her cup once again. "Another problem has arisen on the Wall, however. The brothers of the Night's Watch have taken leave of their wits and chosen Ned Stark's bastard son to be their Lord Commander."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“另外，”太后续道，“‘艾德大人的幼女’此刻正在波顿公爵身边，只等卡林湾陷落便会嫁给他儿子拉姆斯。”只要这女孩能支持波顿家族对临冬城的要求，他们才不管她原本只是小指头送来的、某位总管的女儿呢。“就算北方佬偏爱史塔克，我们也双手奉上了一位。”她让玛瑞魏斯大人满上酒杯。“长城还有些麻烦，守夜人弟兄们失去了理智，竟然选择奈德·史塔克的私生子作总司令。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I glimpsed him once at Winterfell," the queen said, "though the Starks did their best to hide him. He looks very like his father." Her husband's by-blows had his look as well, though at least Robert had the grace to keep them out of sight. Once, after that sorry business with the cat, he had made some noises about bringing some baseborn daughter of his to court. "Do as you please," she'd told him, "but you may find that the city is not a healthy place for a growing girl." The bruise those words had won her had been hard to hide from Jaime, but they heard no more about the bastard girl. Catelyn Tully was a mouse, or she would have smothered this Jon Snow in his cradle. Instead, she's left the filthy task to me. "Snow shares Lord Eddard's taste for treason too," she said. "The father would have handed the realm to Stannis. The son has given him lands and castles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在临冬城见过他一次，”太后道，“当时史塔克家很不想让他露面。嗯，他模样像极了他父亲。”正如劳勃的私生子也像极了劳勃，不过劳勃从不让他们在宫中出现——他只提过一次，就在猫的不幸事件之后，他咕哝了几句要把某位私生女儿带到身边。“你想怎么做就怎么做，”她当场告诫他，“不过我提醒你，到时候你得自己为那小婊子的健康负责。”这番话换来了一块在詹姆面前无法掩饰的淤伤，但有效地阻止了私生女的到来。凯特琳·徒利真是只软弱的老鼠，卧榻之侧，岂容他人酣睡？她下不了手，到头来却把这肮脏的任务丢给了我。“雪诺和艾德大人一样包藏祸心，于国不忠，”瑟曦表示，“作父亲的把王位献给史坦尼斯，当儿子的送出的则是土地与城堡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

If this bastard boy is truly his father's son, he will not suspect a thing. Perhaps he will even thank me, before the blade slides between his ribs. "It will need to be done carefully, to be sure.
