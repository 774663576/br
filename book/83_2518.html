<div class="line_en">The room had been a ballroom once and Eddie Mars had changed it only as much as his business compelled him. No chromium glitter, no indirect lighting from behind angular cornices, no fused glass pictures, or chairs in violent leather and polished metal tubing, none of the pseudomodernistic circus of the typical Hollywood night trap. The light was from heavy crystal chandeliers and the rose-damask panels of the wall were still the same rose damask, a little faded by time and darkened by dust, that had been matched long ago against the parquetry floor, of which only a small glass-smooth space in front of the little Mexican orchestra showed bare. The rest was covered by a heavy old-rose carpeting that must have cost plenty. The parquetry was made of a dozen kinds of hardwood, from Burma teak through half a dozen shades of oak and ruddy wood that looked like mahogany, and fading out to the hard pale wild lilac of the California hills, all laid in elaborate patterns, with the accuracy of a transit.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was about ten-thirty when the little yellow-sashed Mexican orchestra got tired of playing a low-voiced, prettied-up rhumba that nobody was dancing to. The gourd player rubbed his finger tips together as if they were sore and got a cigarette into his mouth almost with the same movement. The other four, with a timed simultaneous stoop, reached under their chairs for glasses from which they sipped, smacking their lips and flashing their eyes. Tequila, their manner said. It was probably mineral water. The pretense was as wasted as the music. Nobody was looking at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="底下根本没有人跳舞，那支人人系着黄腰带的小型墨西哥管弦乐队却一遍又一遍地弹奏着一曲低沉、做作的伦巴，直到十点钟光景，才终于歇手。领头的乐手搓着指尖，像是在缓解疼痛，随后差不多是相同的动作，往嘴里塞进一根烟。另外四个人同时同步俯身从各自的椅子下面拿起杯子，一边抿着杯中物，一边咂嘴瞟眼睛。看他们的样子，喝的是龙舌兰。也可能是矿泉水。他们的装腔作势纯是白费功夫，就跟之前的音乐一样。根本没人在看他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was still a beautiful room and now there was roulette in it instead of measured, old-fashioned dancing. There were three tables close to the far wall. A low bronze railing joined them and made a fence around the croupiers. All three tables were working, but the crowd was at the middle one. I could see Vivian Regan's black head close to it, from across the room where I was leaning against the bar and turning a small glass of bacardi around on the mahogany.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这仍旧是一间漂亮的房间，如今，轮盘赌代替了昔日从容、老派的舞步。靠近另一头的墙的地方，摆着三张赌桌。一条低矮的铜栏杆把桌子连在一起，正好也成了账台管理员身前的护栏。三张赌桌都开着，但人们都围着中间那张。能看到维维安·里根黑魆魆的脑袋凑得很近——我正靠在房间另一边的吧台上，把一小杯巴卡第[1]在红木台面上转来转去。【注：[1]Bacardi：一种古巴朗姆酒。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crowd parted and two men in evening clothes pushed their way out and I saw the back of her neck and her bare shoulders in the opening. She wore a low-cut dress of dull green velvet. It looked too dressy for the occasion. The crowd closed and hid all but her black head. The two men came across the room and leaned against the bar and asked for Scotch and soda. One of them was flushed and excited. He was mopping his face with a black-bordered handkerchief. The double satin stripes down the side of his trousers were wide enough for tire tracks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时人群分开了，两个身穿夜礼服的男子推开一条路走了出来，我在缺口里看到了她的脖子和裸露的肩膀。她穿了一件领口开得很低的暗绿色天鹅绒套裙。在这样的场合里显得过于讲究了。人群又闭合了，遮住了她，看得见的只剩下那颗黑色脑袋。那两个男的穿过房间，往吧台上一靠，点了苏格兰威士忌加苏打水。其中一人脸色泛红，很激动。他正用一块黑色镶边的手帕擦脸。他裤腿两侧的双排缎子贴边宽得都能在上面开车了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It gives me the itch," the other one said. "She's betting a grand at a crack. She can't lose." They put their beaks in their drinks, gurgled swiftly and went back.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="中间那张桌子突然沸反盈天，一个带着外国口音的清晰声音压过了喧闹：“请你耐心等一会儿，夫人。这桌子没法让你下注了。马尔斯先生马上就来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I left my bacardi and padded across the carpet. The little orchestra started to play a tango, rather loud. No one was dancing or intending to dance. I moved through a scattering of people in dinner clothes and full evening dress and sports clothes and business suits to the end table at the left. It had gone dead. Two croupiers stood behind it with their heads together and their eyes sideways. One moved a rake back and forth aimlessly over the empty layout. They were both staring at Vivian Regan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我放下酒，踩着地毯走过去。那支小型管弦乐队演奏起探戈来，声音很大。没人跳舞，也没人打算跳。我从零星几个人身边经过，他们穿着餐服、整套的夜礼服、运动衣和商务装，走到左边那张赌桌跟前。那桌子已经停了。赌桌背后站着两个管理员，正脑袋凑在一起，眼睛看向一边。其中一个把手里的耙子在空荡荡的下注格上漫无目的地前后挪着。他俩都盯着维维安·里根。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her long lashes twitched and her face looked unnaturally white. She was at the middle table, exactly opposite the wheel. There was a disordered pile of money and chips in front of her. It looked like a lot of money. She spoke to the croupier with a cool, insolent, ill-tempered drawl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的睫毛微抖了一下，她的脸白得反常。她站在中间那张桌子前，不偏不倚对着赌盘。她的面前有凌乱的一堆钞票和筹码。看起来是一大笔钱。她慢条斯理地回着管理员的话，冷酷、傲慢，带着怒气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A man beside her tried to tell her something. She turned swiftly and spat something at him and he faded back into the crowd red-faced. A door opened in the paneling at the far end of the enclosed place made by the bronze railing. Eddie Mars came through the door with a set indifferent smile on his face, his hands thrust into the pockets of his dinner jacket, both thumbnails glistening outside. He seemed to like that pose. He strolled behind the croupiers and stopped at the corner of the middle table. He spoke with lazy calm, less politely than the croupier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旁边有个男人想对她说点什么。她猛一转身，朝他啐了一口，他红着脸退回了人群中。围着铜栏杆那片区域另一头，墙板上有扇门开了。艾迪·马尔斯走了出来，一抹漠然的笑容凝固在脸上，他的手插在小礼服口袋里，两只拇指指甲都露在外面，闪闪发亮。他好像很喜欢这个姿势。他溜达到管理员身后，在赌桌一角站定。他的声音平静、慵懒，不像管理员那么客气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The croupier leaned over the table without haste. He counted and stacked her money and chips, placed all but a few chips and bills in a neat pile and pushed the rest back off the layout with his rake. He opened Eddie Mars' wallet and drew out two flat packets of thousand-dollar bills. He broke one, counted six bills out, added them to the unbroken packet, put the four loose bills in the wallet and laid it aside as carelessly as if it had been a packet of matches. Eddie Mars didn't touch the wallet. Nobody moved except the croupier. He spun the wheel left-handed and sent the ivory ball skittering along the upper edge with a casual flirt of his wrist. Then he drew his hands back and folded his arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="管理员不慌不忙地俯身看向桌面。他数了数她的钱和筹码，叠好，把其中大部分的赌资堆成整齐的一摞，剩下的一些用耙子推出下注格。他打开艾迪·马尔斯的钱包，抽出扁扁的两叠千元大钞。他拆开一叠，点出六张钞票，跟另一叠完好的钞票归在一起，四张散钱则放回了钱包。他把钱包随手扔在一旁，仿佛那只是一盒火柴。艾迪·马尔斯没有去碰钱包。除了管理员，谁都没有动。他向左转动赌盘，手腕随意一挥，那颗象牙球便轻快地沿着上沿滚动起来。接着他抽回双手，交叠抱在胸前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie Mars smiled faintly, then nodded and reached into his inner breast pocket. He drew out a large pinseal wallet with gold corners and tossed it carelessly along the table to the croupier. "Cover her bet in even thousands," he said, "if no one objects to this turn of the wheel being just for the lady."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾迪·马尔斯淡淡一笑，点点头，把手伸进内侧的胸袋。他抽出一只角上包金的硕大海豹皮钱包，漫不经心地扔给桌子那头的管理员。“不管她下注多少，都接。”他说，“如果没人反对，这一次轮盘就专为这位女士开。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A dozen people let their breath out at the same time and broke for the bar. I broke with them and got to the far end of the room before Vivian had gathered up her winnings and turned away from the table. I went out into the large quiet lobby, got my hat and coat from the check girl, dropped a quarter in her tray and went out on the porch. The doorman loomed up beside me and said: "Can I get your car for you, sir?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一大帮子人同时松了口气，四散向吧台走去。我趁维维安还在忙着收拢赢得的钱，没来得及从桌前转身，赶紧随着人流走到了房间另一头。我出门走进大厅，从女侍那儿拿回帽子和外套，往她的托盘里丢了二十五分钱，走到屋外的门廊里。门卫赫然出现在我身旁，说道：“要帮你取车吗，先生？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The red wins," he said formally, without interest. The little ivory ball lay in Red 25, the third number from the Double Zero. Vivian Regan put her head back and laughed triumphantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“红色赢。”他一本正经道，不带一丝感情。那颗象牙小球停在“红25”的位置，是“双零”后面的第三个数字。维维安·里根一仰头，得意地大笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vivian's lips parted slowly until her teeth caught the light and glittered like knives. The ball drifted lazily down the slope of the wheel and bounced on the chromium ridges above the numbers. After a long time and then very suddenly motion left it with a dry click. The wheel slowed, carrying the ball around with it. The croupier didn't unfold his arms until the wheel had entirely ceased to revolve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维维安的嘴唇慢慢张了开来，终于，灯光把她的牙齿照得闪闪发亮，犹如一把把刀刃。那颗小球懒洋洋地滚下轮盘坡道，在数字标示上方的镀铬脊棱上一蹦一跳。就这样过了很久，随后只听得一声刺耳的“喀嚓”，小球突然静止了。轮盘动得越来越慢，带着小球一起转。直到轮盘完全停止转动，那管理员才展开双臂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My steps hadn't made any sound on the soft moist turf. The man coughed again, then stifled the cough with a handkerchief or a sleeve. While he was still doing that I moved forward closer to him. I made him out, a vague shadow close to the path. Something made me step behind a tree and crouch down. The man turned his head. His face should have been a white blur when he did that. It wasn't. It remained dark. There was a mask over it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的脚步在柔软湿润的草皮上没有发出任何声响。那男人又咳了起来，接着不知用手帕还是袖管捂住了嘴。趁他还无暇他顾，我上前两步，跟他靠得更近了。看到他了，是个站在小路边的模糊人影。我听到有动静，立刻迈到一棵树后面，蹲伏着。那男人转过来了。照理说此时他的脸应该是模糊的一摊白色。并非如此。他的脸依然漆黑一片。他戴了面具。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The scrollwork along the edge of the porch was wet with the fog. The fog dripped from the Monterey cypresses that shadowed off into nothing towards the cliff above the Ocean. You could see a scant dozen feet in any direction. I went down the porch steps and drifted off through the trees, following an indistinct path until I could hear the wash of the surf licking at the fog, low down at the bottom of the cliff. There wasn't a gleam of light anywhere. I could see a dozen trees clearly at one time, another dozen dimly, then nothing at all but the fog. I circled to the left and drifted back towards the gravel path that went around to the stables where they parked the cars. When I could make out the outlines of the house I stopped. A little in front of me I had heard a man cough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门廊边缘的那排涡卷装饰被雾气氲湿了。雾水是从那片辐射柏上滴下来的，从此处到大洋上的峭壁，树影越来越浅，直至消失不见。不管朝哪个方向，你都只能看到区区十几英尺之外。我走下门廊台阶，散着步穿过树林，一路走了下去，直到我听得到遥远的峭壁底下传来浪涛舔舐雾气的声音。哪里都看不到一丝光亮。有时我一眼望去，一处的十几棵树清清楚楚，另一处的十几棵却又模模糊糊，再看时就只能看到雾了。我向左转身，信步踱回那条绕向他们用来停车的马厩的石子路。等到可以看清房子的轮廓时，我停下了脚步。我听到，在我身前咫尺之遥有个男人在咳嗽。">查看中文翻译</div>
