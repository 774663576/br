<div class="line_en">You see, though nothing mattered to me, I could feel pain, for instance. If anyone had stuck me it would have hurt me. It was the same morally: if anything very pathetic happened, I should have felt pity just as I used to do in old days when there were things in life that did matter to me. I had felt pity that evening. I should have certainly helped a child. Why, then, had I not helped the little girl? Because of an idea that occurred to me at the time: when she was calling and pulling at me, a question suddenly arose before me and I could not settle it. The question was an idle one, but I was vexed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was vexed at the reflection that if I were going to make an end of myself that night, nothing in life ought to have mattered to me. Why was it that all at once I did not feel a strange pang, quite incongruous in my position. Really I do not know better how to convey my fleeting sensation at the moment, but the sensation persisted at home when I was sitting at the table, and I was very much irritated as I had not been for a long time past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我生气是由于有了这么一个结论：我既然已经决定今夜自杀，那么，我现在对世间的一切比过去任何时候都更加无所谓了。我为什么突然感到我不是全无所谓，而去可怜一个小女孩呢？我记得，我十分同情她，甚至于有过一种奇怪的心疼感，在我这种处境下，这种感觉甚至令人难以相信。的确，我无法更好地把我当时那种转瞬即逝的感觉转述出来，不过，这个感觉直至我回到家在桌旁坐下来仍未消逝，以至我非常生气，这是很久以来不曾有过的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And can it really be true that the consciousness that I shall completely cease to exist immediately and so everything else will cease to exist, does not in the least affect my feeling of pity for the child nor the feeling of shame after a contemptible action? I stamped and shouted at the unhappy child as though to say -- not only I feel no pity, but even if I behave inhumanly and contemptibly, I am free to, for in another two hours everything will be extinguished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道，我即将完全消失，因而一切也将不复存在，那么，这种认识对于我对小女孩的爱怜之心，对于做了卑鄙事以后的羞耻心，不能没有丝毫影响吧？须知，正因为如此，我才会对不幸的小女孩跺脚，向她粗野地吼叫，好像在说，“我不仅没有同情心，而且如果要我去干毫无人性的丑行，现在我都可以去干的，因为两个小时之后一切都将逝去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One reflection followed another. I saw clearly that so long as I was still a human being and not nothingness, I was alive and so could suffer, be angry and feel shame at my actions. So be it. But if I am going to kill myself, in two hours, say, what is the little girl to me and what have I to do with shame or with anything else in the world? I shall turn into nothing, absolutely nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="推论一个个纷至沓来。很显然，既然我是人，而不是子虚，暂时也没有化为乌有，那么我就还活着，因此就会有苦恼，有愤怒，有为自己的举止而感到羞耻的心。就算是这样吧。但是，既然我将自杀，比方说，再有两个小时我就要死去了，那么小女孩于我有什么相干呢？羞耻心、世间的一切与我又有什么相干呢？我行将化为乌有，彻底消亡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Do you believe that that was why I shouted that? I am almost convinced of it now. I seemed clear to me that life and the world somehow depended upon me now. I may almost say that the world now seemed created for me alone: if I shot myself the world would cease to be at least for me. I say nothing of its being likely that nothing will exist for anyone when I am gone, and that as soon as my consciousness is extinguished the whole world will vanish too and become void like a phantom, as a mere appurtenance of my consciousness, for possibly all this world and all these people are only me myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="您能相信吗？这就是我对她吼叫的原因。对这一点我现在几乎深信不疑。十分显然，生命和世界现在仿佛都要取决于我，甚至可以这么说，现在这世界仿佛也是为我一个人而创造的：我自杀了，世界也就不再有了，至少对于我来说是如此。我的知觉一旦消失，整个世界也就随即消亡，就像幽灵一样，就像依附于我的知觉一样，因为这整个世界和全人类也许就是我自己一个人。至于我死后，对任何人来说也许真的什么都不再存在了，这一点已不必去谈了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In short, the child had saved me, for I put off my pistol shot for the sake of these questions. Meanwhile the clamour had begun to subside in the captain's room: they had finished their game, were settling down to sleep, and meanwhile were grumbling and languidly winding up their quarrels. At that point, I suddenly fell asleep in my chair at the table -- a thing which had never happened to me before. I dropped asleep quite unawares. Dreams, as we all know, are very queer things: some parts are presented with appalling vividness, with details worked up with the elaborate finish of jewellery, while others one gallops through, as it were, without noticing them at all, as, for instance, through space and time. Dreams seem to be spurred on not by reason but by desire, not by the head but by the heart, and yet what complicated tricks my reason has played sometimes in dreams, what utterly incomprehensible things happen to it! Mr brother died five years ago, for instance. I sometimes dream of him; he takes part in my affairs, we are very much interested, and yet all through my dream I quite know and remember that my brother is dead and buried. How is it that I am not surprised that, though he is dead, he is here beside me and working with me? Why is it that my reason fully accepts it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，这个小女孩救了我，由于这些问题我迟延了自杀。这时，大尉房里的嘈杂声开始平息下来：他们玩过牌后在准备睡觉，不过暂时还有人在嘟嘟囔囔说胡话，懒洋洋地轻声叫骂。就在这时，我坐在桌旁安乐椅里忽然睡着了，这是从来没有过的。我完全是在不知不觉中睡着的。大家知道，梦是一种稀奇古怪的东西：有的十分清晰，细节都似珠宝饰物那样精美；有的你会觉得一晃而过，仿佛超越了时空全无感觉。引起梦境的似乎不是理智，而是愿望，不是大脑，而是心灵；然而，我的理智在梦中有时有多巧妙，而且会生出一些完全不可思议的事情来。例如，我哥哥去世已经五年，我有时还梦见他：他帮我做事，我们互相关心，而我在梦中一直十分清楚和记得，我哥哥已经死了，埋了。他虽然是死人，仍在我身边为我忙碌，为什么我的理智会完全容忍发生这一切呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remember that as I sat and reflected, I turned all these new questions that swarmed one after another quite the other way, and thought of something quite new. For instance, a strange reflection suddenly occurred to me, that if I had lived before on the moon or on Mars and there had committed the most disgraceful and dishonourable action and had there been put to such shame and ignominy as one can only conceive and realise in dreams, in nightmares, and if, finding myself afterwards on earth, I were able to retain the memory of what I had done on the other planet and at the same time knew that I should never, under any circumstances, return there, then looking from the earth to the moon -- should I care or not? Should I feel shame for that action or not? These were idle and superfluous questions for the revolver was already lying before me, and I knew in every fibre of my being that it would happen for certain, but they excited me and I raged. I could not die now without having first settled something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得，我坐在那儿反反复复地思考着所有这些接踵而来的新问题，甚至生出异念，异想天开起来。比方，我突发奇想，假如我以前生活在月球上或火星上，在那里做了最无耻的事情并且遭到斥责和羞辱，这除非有时在梦境中或在噩梦中才能感觉和想象得到；又假如，我后来来到了地球上，而又记得自己在别的星球上的所作所为，此外，还知道我再也不会回到月球上，那么，当我从地球上仰望月球时，——是否会觉得无所谓呢？是否会为自己的丑行而感到羞愧呢？思考这些问题是无益的、多余的，因为手枪已摆在我的面前，我的整个身心也感觉到了这事必将发生。但是，这些问题刺激着我，使我愤怒。不先把问题弄明白，我似乎暂时还不能死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But enough. I will begin about my dream. Yes, I dreamed a dream, my dream of the third of November. They tease me now, telling me it was only a dream. But does it matter whether it was a dream or reality, if the dream made known to me the truth? If once one has recognized the truth and seen it, you know that it is the truth and that there is no other and there cannot be, whether you are asleep or awake. Let it be a dream, so be it, but that real life of which you make so much I had meant to extinguish by suicide, and my dream, my dream -- oh, it revealed to me a different life, renewed, grand and full of power!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好，不谈这个，说说我的那个梦吧。是的，我当时做了一个梦，就是十一月三日的那个梦！他们现在还在耍笑我，说那只不过是一场梦而已。不过，既然那个梦能告诉我真理，是梦不是梦难道不是都无所谓吗？你要是发现和认清了真理，那么，不论你是睡着还是醒着的时候都知道，这就是真理，没有也不可能有别的真理了。好吧，就算这是做梦，就算这样，但是，被你们说得天花乱坠的那种生活，我却要用自杀来结束它了，而我的梦，我的梦——啊，则给我展示了一种崭新的光辉灿烂、焕然一新、充满活力的生活！">查看中文翻译</div>
