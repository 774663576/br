<div class="line_en">At about the same time, he had the following experience: He had been meeting a young woman in a room that an old friend put at his disposal every day until midnight. After a month or two, she reminded him of one of their early encounters: they had made love on a rug under the window while it was thundering and lightning outside; they had made love for the length of the storm; it had been unforgettably beautiful!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差不多就在那个时期，他还有过这样的事：跟一个年轻女子多次幽会，地点就在老朋友借给他的公寓里，那房子他每天可以一直使用到半夜。一两个月之后，她跟他提起他们有过的一次幽会：他们就在窗前的地毯上做爱，她说，外面电光闪闪，雷声隆隆。他们在狂风暴雨中做爱，她说，真美，令人难忘啊！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas was appalled. Yes, he remembered making love to her on the rug (his friend slept on a narrow couch that Tomas found uncomfortable), but he had completely forgotten the storm! It was odd. He could recall each of their times together; he had even kept close track of the ways they made love (she refused to be entered from behind); he remembered several of the things she had said during intercourse (she would ask him to squeeze her hips and to stop looking at her all the time); he even remembered the cut of her lingerie; but the storm had left no trace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听着听着，托马斯很吃惊：没错，他记得他们是在地毯上做爱（朋友的单间公寓里只有一张狭窄的长沙发，躺在上面他感觉不舒服），然而他把暴风雨给彻底忘了！真奇怪：他想起跟她的几次幽会，甚至清楚地记得他们做爱的方式（她拒绝从后面进入），记得做爱时她常说的几句话（她总是要他搂紧她的髋，如果他看她，她会抗议），他甚至记得她内衣的式样——然而，他完全记不得那场暴风雨了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of each erotic experience his memory recorded only the steep and narrow path of sexual conquest: the first piece of verbal aggression, the first touch, the first obscenity he said to her and she to him, the minor perversions he could make her acquiesce in and the ones she held out against. All else he excluded (almost pedantically) from his memory. He even forgot where he had first seen one or another woman, if that event occurred before his sexual offensive began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于有过的风流韵事，他的回忆只记录下性征服这条崎岖而狭窄的道路：第一声挑逗，第一次触摸，他告诉她与她告诉他的第一件淫事，以及所有那些他慢慢强迫对方接受、直至遭受拒绝的反常的小小性把戏。剩下的全部被他排斥（几乎以学究般的细心）在记忆之外。他甚至记不得第一次遇上这个或那个女人是在什么地方，因为相遇的一刻还发生在纯粹意义上的性征服之前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young woman smiled dreamily as she went on about the storm, and he looked at her in amazement and something akin to shame: she had experienced something beautiful, and he had failed to experience it with her. The two ways in which their memories reacted to the evening storm sharply delimit love and nonlove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻女子在讲述着暴风雨，脸上挂着梦幻般的微笑。他惊讶地看着她，几乎有些羞愧：她经历了某种美妙的东西，而他却没有和她一起经历。他们的记忆对那天夜里暴风雨的反应，是截然不同的，可从中看到爱与不爱的巨大区别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the word nonlove I do not wish to imply that he took a cynical attitude to the young woman, that, as present-day parlance has it, he looked upon her as a sex object; on the contrary, he was quite fond of her, valued her character and intelligence, and was willing to come to her aid if ever she needed him. He was not the one who behaved shamefully towards her; it was his memory, for it was his memory that, unbeknown to him, had excluded her from the sphere of love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不爱，并不意味着托马斯对那个年轻女人厚颜无耻，像人们说的那样，只把她看作性工具。相反，他像爱女友一般爱她，欣赏她的个性和智慧，只要她有需要，他随时会帮她。待她不好的不是他，而是他的记忆，他无能为力，是记忆将她从爱情区域排除出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The brain appears to possess a special area which we might call poetic memory and which records everything that charms or touches us, that makes our lives beautiful. From the time he met Tereza, no woman had the right to leave the slightest impression on that part of his brain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看来，大脑中有一个专门的区域，我们可称之为诗化记忆，它记录的，是让我们陶醉，令我们感动，赋予我们的生活以美丽的一切。自从托马斯认识特蕾莎之后，没有任何女人能够在他头脑的这个区域留下印记，哪怕是最短暂的印记。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tereza occupied his poetic memory like a despot and exterminated all trace of other women. That was unfair, because the young woman he made love to on the rug during the storm was not a bit less worthy of poetry than Tereza. She shouted, Close your eyes! Squeeze my hips! Hold me tight!. she could not stand it that when Tomas made love he kept his eyes open, focused and observant, his body ever so slightly arched above her, never pressing against her skin. She did not want him to study her. She wanted to draw him into the magic stream that may be entered only with closed eyes. The reason she refused to get down on all fours was that in that position their bodies did not touch at all and he could observe her from a distance of several feet. She hated that distance. She wanted to merge with him. That is why, looking him straight in the eye, she insisted she had not had an orgasm even though the rug was fairly dripping with it. It's not sensual pleasure I'm after, she would say, it's happiness. And pleasure without happiness is not pleasure. In other words, she was pounding on the gate of his poetic memory. But the gate was shut. There was no room for her in his poetic memory. There was room for her only on the rug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎像暴君般独霸他的诗化记忆，将其他女人留下的痕迹一扫而光。这不公平，因为，比如说，在暴风雨中，跟他在地毯上做爱的年轻女子并不比特蕾莎缺乏诗意。她对他嘶喊：“闭上眼，搂紧我的髋，抱紧我！”她不能忍受托马斯做爱时睁着眼，以专注、探究的目光看她，她无法忍受他的身体稍稍抬起，在她的上方，而不贴紧她的肌肤。她不想让他研究她。她想领他进入狂喜的波涛，只有闭着眼睛才能潜入其中。她拒绝趴下身体，因为这种体位令他们的身体难于接触，而他就能从差不多五十厘米之外观察她。她厌恶这段距离，想和他融为一体。她盯着他，硬是跟他说自己没有得到享受，尽管地毯已被她的爱液浸透：“我寻求的不是快感，而是幸福。没有幸福的快感，那算不上快感。”换句话说，她敲打着他的诗化记忆之门。然而，门紧闭着。托马斯的诗化记忆中，没有她的位置。她的位置只在地毯上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His adventure with Tereza began at the exact point where his adventures with other women left off. It took place on the other side of the imperative that pushed him into conquest after conquest. He had no desire to uncover anything in Tereza. She had come to him uncovered. He had made love to her before he could grab for the imaginary scalpel he used to open the prostrate body of the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯和其他女人的艳遇结束之处，恰恰正是他和特蕾莎的艳遇开始之端。与特蕾莎的艳遇并非源自促使他追逐女性的迫切欲望。他不想在特蕾莎身上揭示什么。在他眼里，她已经毫无遮掩了。在用想象的解剖刀划开世界这横陈之躯以前，他就已经迫不及待地与她做了爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their love story did not begin until afterward: she fell ill and he was unable to send her home as he had the others. Kneeling by her as she lay sleeping in his bed, he realized that someone had sent her downstream in a bulrush basket. I have said before that metaphors are dangerous. Love begins with a metaphor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱情故事只发生在做爱之后：她发烧了，他不能像对其他女人那样送她回家。他跪在床头边，冒出一个念头：她是被别人放在篮子里，顺水漂流送到他身边的。我已经说过，隐喻是危险的。爱由隐喻而起。">查看中文翻译</div>
