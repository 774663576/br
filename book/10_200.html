<div class="line_en">Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost hood, cloak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends. He wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink westwards-behind the mountains. Their shadows fell across Bilbo's path, and he looked back. Then he looked forward and could see before him only ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed occasionally between the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">He still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside him. He wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. He had just made up his mind that it was his duty, that he must turn back-and very miserable he felt about it-when he heard voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续漫无目的地往前走，走出了狭窄的山谷，越过了山谷边缘，往山坡下走去，但心中一直萦绕着一个让他很不舒服的念头。他在想的是，既然已经有了魔法戒指，难道不该再回到那些恐怖黑暗的隧道中找寻自己的朋友吗？他刚下定决心，认为这是他的责任，必须回去——这想法让他很是痛苦——就在这时，他听见了说话的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will give them all a surprise," he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were discussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and debating what they were to do now. The dwarves were grumbling, and Gandalf was saying that they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the hands of the goblins, without trying to find out if he was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要给大家一个惊喜。”他这么想着，就钻进了山谷边的灌木丛中。甘道夫正在和矮人们争论着什么，他们在讨论着发生在隧道中的事情，想要决定接下来该怎么办。矮人们在抱怨着，而甘道夫则坚持说决不能把巴金斯先生留在半兽人手里，他们自己管自己上路，至少得弄清他是死是活，或者该去尝试营救他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so he crept forward carefully. He was on a stony path winding downwards with a rocky wall on the left hand; on the other side the ground sloped away and there were dells below the level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees. In one of these dells under the bushes people were talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他停下脚步听了起来。这不像是半兽人的声音，因此他小心翼翼地又朝前走了几步。这时他踏在一条蜿蜒向下的石径上，左边是一片岩壁，另一边则是一道通往下方的斜坡，从上面看去，可以看见下面的山谷中长着许多灌木和低矮的植物。在其中一座山谷中的灌木丛之下，有人在交谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a head with a red hood on: it was Balin doing look-out. He could have clapped and shouted for joy, but he did not. He had still got the ring on, for fear of meeting something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking straight at him without noticing him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又潜近了些，突然看见一个戴着红兜帽的脑袋在两块大石头间若隐若现：那是负责站岗的巴林。他差点高兴得拍手大叫起来，但他忍住了。由于担心还会遇到什么意外的险情，他手上依然戴着戒指，因此，他看见巴林虽然看着自己的方向，却根本没注意到自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf answered angrily: "I brought him, and I don't bring things that are of no use. Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again, you will thank me before all is over.

<div class="line_cn" title="矮人们想要知道当初把他带来究竟有什么用，为什么他不能跟紧他的朋友们，和他们一起行动，巫师又为什么不挑选一个更机灵点的家伙。“到目前为止他惹的麻烦比帮的忙多，”有人说，“如果我们现在还得回到那可恶的隧道里去找他，还不如让他见鬼去呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

You nearly chopped off my head with Glamdring, and Thorin was stabbing here there and everywhere with Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding flashes, and we saw the goblins running back yelping. You shouted 'follow me everybody!' and everybody ought to have followed. We thought everybody had. There was no time to count, as you know quite well, till we had dashed through the gate-guards, out of the lower door, and helter-skelter down here.

<div class="line_en">"And here's the burglar!" said Bilbo stepping down into the middle of them, and slipping off the ring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“飞贼在这儿呢！”比尔博说着走到大伙儿中间，褪下了戒指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside and said nothing whatever about the ring; and when they asked him how he did it, he said: "Oh, just crept along, you know-very carefully and quietly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大伙儿的赞誉比尔博听了着实受用，他在心中窃笑着，嘴上却对戒指的事只字不提。当大家问他究竟怎么办到的时候，他说：“哦，没什么，悄悄地走过来就行了——当然，要非常小心，一点声音也没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bless me, how they jumped! Then they shouted with surprise and delight. Gandalf was as astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the others. He called to Balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man who let people walk right into them like that without warning. It is a fact that Bilbo's reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this. If they had still doubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of Gandalf's words, they doubted no longer. Balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it was a very clever bit of work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的天哪，大家伙儿见了他全都跳了起来，然后发出惊喜的欢呼。甘道夫和别人一样吃惊，但他的欢喜或许要更胜其他人一筹。他把巴林叫了过来，问他是怎么放的哨，居然让人走到了他们身边而没有发出一点警告。经过这件事以后，比尔博在矮人们中间声名鹊起。就算之前他们对比尔博作为一流飞贼的身份仍然有所怀疑，哪怕甘道夫再怎么夸奖、推荐也没用，可现在他们彻彻底底地服了。尽管巴林依旧百思不得其解，但大家却都说比尔博这手露得真漂亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And then I couldn't think of any other question with him sitting beside me," ended Bilbo; "so I said 'what's in my pocket?' And he couldn't guess in three goes. So I said: 'what about your promise? Show me the way out!' But he came at me to kill me, and I ran, and fell over, and he missed me in the dark. Then I followed him, because I heard him talking to himself. He thought I really knew the way out, and so he was making for it. And then he sat down in the entrance, and I could not get by. So I jumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the gate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那时，他在我旁边坐着，我哪还想得出什么谜题啊，”比尔博的讲述临近了尾声，“所以，我就问‘我的口袋里面有什么？’他连猜了三次都没猜中。于是我问他：‘你答应的事怎么办？你得带我出去！’可是他过来要杀我，我撒腿就跑，没多久摔了一跤，黑暗之中他从我旁边擦身而过。然后我就一路跟着他，因为我听见过他自言自语，他以为我其实知道出去的路，就沿着这条路一路走来。到了入口的地方，他一屁股坐了下来，把我的路给挡住了。最后，我只好从他头上跳了过去，一路跑到了大石门。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost him, and he sat down and told them everything-except about the finding of the ring ("not just now" he thought).

<div class="line_en">"O yes! lots of them; but I dodged 'em. I got stuck in the door, which was only open a crack, and I lost lots of buttons," he said sadly looking at his torn clothes. "But I squeezed through all right-and here I am."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What did I tell you?" said Gandalf laughing. "Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess." He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我跟你们怎么说来着？”甘道夫笑着说道，“巴金斯先生的实力可是远远超出你们的想像啊！”他说这话的时候，从他那浓密的眉毛下面对巴金斯使了个奇怪的眼色，霍比特人不禁怀疑他是否已经猜到故事中他隐瞒掉的内容了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves, Bilbo had not heard it. He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, and where they had all got to now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，比尔博也有问题要问。就算之前甘道夫已经对矮人们都解释过一切了，可比尔博并没有听到。他想要知道巫师是怎么重新出现的，他们后来又去了哪儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than once, so now he told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains. But their main gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently people had given up going that way, and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说实话，巫师并不介意再次讲述他的聪明睿智，因此，他就跟比尔博说了起来。他和埃尔隆德早就知道这一带有邪恶的半兽人出没，但是，以前他们的正门是在另一个路上的，一条更好走些的路，他们经常在夜晚捕捉不小心靠近的旅人。显然，人们后来再也不走那条路了，于是半兽人肯定在山顶的通道，也就是矮人们走的那条路旁盖了个新的门，这应该是最近的事情，因为直到现在，人们都觉得那条路是相当安全的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo's yell he realized what had happened. In the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the crack, just as it snapped to. He followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up the best magic he could in the shadows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫在避雨的山洞里一听到比尔博的叫喊，就意识到发生了什么。借着那道杀死那些抓他的半兽人的闪光，他在裂缝合拢前的一刹那溜了进去。他跟着半兽人士兵和他们的囚犯一路来到大厅附近，接着他坐了下来，开始在黑暗中准备他所掌握的最强大的魔法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But, of course, Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights (even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old Took's midsummer-eve parties, as you remember). The rest we all know-except that Gandalf knew all about the back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate, where Bilbo lost his buttons.

<div class="line_en">"O yes!" he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit. "You lose track of time inside goblin-tunnels. Today's Thursday, and it was Monday night or Tuesday morning that we were captured. We have gone miles and miles, and come right down through the heart of the mountains, and are now on the other side-quite a short cut. But we are not at the point to which our pass would have brought us; we are too far to the North, and have some awkward country ahead. And we are still pretty high up. Let's get on!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的！”还没等霍比特人提出更多的问题来他就先回答了，“你在半兽人的洞穴中已经忘记白天黑夜了。今天是周四，我们是在周一晚上或周二凌晨被抓的，从那以后走了很长的路，从大山的肚子里穿了出来，现在来到了山的另外一边——倒是条捷径，但和我们经过原计划中的道路所到达的地点有一段距离，太偏北了，所以前面会有一段不太好走的乡村野路。我们现在所处位置的地势还很高呢，还是快赶路吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They made that gate ages ago," he said, "partly for a way of escape, if they needed one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the dark and do great damage. They guard it always and no one has ever managed to block it up. They will guard it doubly after this," he laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们在很多年之前就造了这座大门，既是为了在需要的时候能有一条逃跑的路径，也是为了有一条路通向山背后的地区，他们现在还会趁天黑出来，对这一带造成很大的祸害。他们日夜守着这个出口，没有任何人能够将这个门堵死。经过这次事情后，他们肯定更要加强守卫了。”甘道夫大笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the wizard called them to their senses. "We must be getting on at once, now we are a little rested," he said. "They will be out after us in hundreds when night comes on; and already shadows are lengthening. They can smell our footsteps for hours and hours after we have passed. We must be miles on before dusk. There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and that is lucky. Not that they mind the moon much, but it will give us a little light to steer by."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但巫师让他们恢复了清醒。“既然我们已经稍稍休息了一下，那么必须要马上出发了。”他说，“等夜幕降临，就会有成百上千的半兽人出来追杀我们。现在影子已经渐渐长起来了，只要是我们经过的地方，他们在若干小时内都还能闻出我们的足迹，因此我们必须赶在天黑之前尽量远离此地。如果天气一直晴好的话，晚上会有一点月光，这对我们来说是幸运的事情。他们不是很在乎月光，但月光能方便我们认路前进。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the others laughed too. After all they had lost a good deal, but they had killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides, and they had all escaped, so they might be said to have had the best of it so far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他的人也跟着开怀大笑。虽然他们损失了很多东西，但他们也杀死了那个高大的半兽人首领和许多半兽人士兵，而且都安全地逃了出来。所以，到目前为止，他们或许可以说是取得了胜利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They still went on and on. The rough path disappeared. The bushes, and the long grasses between the boulders, the patches of rabbit-cropped turf, the thyme and the sage and the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all vanished, and they found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the remains of a landslide.

They slid into the edge of a climbing wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower branches, some (like the little hobbit) got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning among the bracken and the pine-roots far below.</div>

Already the shadows were deepening about them, though far away through the trees and over the black tops of those growing lower down they could still see the evening lights on the plains beyond.

At times they were pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit's head; at times they were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine-needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got heavier and the forest-silence deeper.

<div class="line_en">"Up the trees quick!" cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up. They found them as quick as ever they could, you can guess; and up they went as high as ever they could trust the branches. You would have laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. Fili and Kili were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were more comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost boughs. Gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others, had found a tree into which they could not climb, a large pine standing at the very edge of the glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon as he peeped out.</div>

These they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the middle of the circle was a great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the dreadful language of the Wargs. Gandalf understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about cruel and wicked things, as it was.

<div class="line_en">In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back into it from the South, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. There were many of them, and they were brave and well-armed, and even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many together, or in the bright day. But now they had planned with the goblins' help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. If their plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as prisoners to their caves.</div>

<div class="line_en">I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Bilbo did not understand it. The Wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far from their mountains, unless they are driven out and are looking for new homes, or are marching to war (which I am glad to say has not happened for a long while). But in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got the Wargs to help and shared the plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. The Wargs had come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late. The reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great Goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting.</div>

The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding them here in their very meeting-place. They thought they were friends of the woodmen, and were come to spy on them, and would take news of their plans down into the valleys, and then the goblins and the wolves would have to fight a terrible battle instead of capturing prisoners and devouring people waked suddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no intention of going away and letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And long before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; and goblins can climb trees, or cut them down.</div>

All the same he was not going to let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below. He gathered the huge pine-cones from the branches of the tree. Then he set one alight with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on the back, and immediately his shaggy coat caught fire, and he was leaping to and fro yelping horribly. Then another came and another, one in blue flames, one in red, another in green. They burst on the ground in the middle of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and smoke.

<div class="line_en">Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds; they were proud and strong and noble-hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. When they took any notice of them at all (which was seldom, for they did not eat such creatures), they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to their caves, and stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. The goblins hated the eagles and feared them, but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive them from the mountains.</div>

<div class="line_en">A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of the Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.</div>

Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the eagle-lord appeared to know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from an arrow-wound. So you see 'prisoners' had meant 'prisoners rescued from the goblins' only, and not captives of the eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized that at last they were going to escape really and truly from the dreadful mountains.

Bilbo was too weak to help, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down after doing his part in setting the fire going, since Oin and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never taken to matches even yet.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，岩壁上就烧起了明亮的火堆，矮人们围着火堆烹烤着，弄出好闻的烤肉香气来。大鹰们给他们送上了干树枝，还送来了几只兔子和一只小绵羊。料理的事情则由矮人们自己来操办。比尔博身体太虚弱了，什么忙都帮不上，再说给兔子剥皮或切肉这些事他也做不大来，在他以前的生活中，他一直习惯了由屠夫准备好一切，自己只要直接拿来做就行了。由于欧因和格罗因把火绒盒（矮人们直到那时也还不习惯用火柴）弄丢了，所以甘道夫帮大家生了火，做完这以后，他也躺倒休息去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So ended the adventures of the Misty Mountains. Soon Bilbo's stomach was feeling full and comfortable again, and he felt he could sleep contentedly, though really he would have liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat toasted on sticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done on his feather-bed in his own little hole at home. But all night he dreamed of his own house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for something that he could not find nor remember what it looked like.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迷雾山脉的冒险就这样结束了。不久，比尔博的肚子又再次有了饱足的畅美感觉，他觉得这下可以美美地睡上一觉了，虽然按他平时的胃口，他比较喜欢面包和牛油，而不是树枝叉着的烤肉。他蜷缩成一团，在坚硬的岩石上睡着了，睡得甚至比在自己家里的羽毛床上还美。不过，一整晚他都梦到自己家，梦见自己在屋子的各个不同房间里找东西，可那东西他既没有找到，也不记得是什么样子的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
