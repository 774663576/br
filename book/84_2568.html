<div class="line_en">But seeing her now, standing watch over her fields and pastures, I realized that I had misunderstood her. She was not angry with me for leaving, because leaving was a part of her cycle. Her role was not to corral the buffalo, not to gather and confine them by force. It was to celebrate their return.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was spring when I arrived in the valley. I drove along the highway to the edge of town, then pulled over at the drop-off overlooking the Bear River. From there I could look out over the basin, a patchwork of expectant fields stretching to Buck's Peak. The mountain was crisp with evergreens, which were luminous set against the browns and grays of shale and limestone. The Princess was as bright as I'd ever seen her. She stood facing me, the valley between us, radiating permanence.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Princess had been haunting me. From across the ocean I'd heard her beckoning, as if I were a troublesome calf who'd wandered from her herd. Her voice had been gentle at first, coaxing, but when I didn't answer, when I stayed away, it had turned to fury. I had betrayed her. I imagined her face contorted with rage, her stance heavy and threatening. She had been living in my mind like this for years, a deity of contempt.</div>

<div class="line_en">I backtracked a quarter mile into town and parked beside Grandma-over-in-town's white picket fence. In my mind it was still her fence, even though she didn't live here anymore: she had been moved to a hospice facility near Main Street.</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat in the living room; the carpet was the same crisp white from my childhood. The visit was short and polite. He talked about Grandma, whom he had cared for long after she ceased to recognize him. I talked about England. Grandpa mentioned my mother, and when he spoke of her it was with the same look of awe that I had seen in the faces of her followers. I didn't blame him. From what I'd heard, my parents were powerful people in the valley. Mother was marketing her products as a spiritual alternative to Obamacare, and she was selling product as fast as she could make it, even with dozens of employees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler and Stefanie lived a hundred miles north of Buck's Peak, in Idaho Falls. It was there I planned to go next, but before leaving the valley, I wrote my mother.

<div class="line_en">Over the years I'd heard many rumors about my parents: that they were millionaires, that they were building a fortress on the mountain, that they had hidden away enough food to last decades. The most interesting, by far, were the stories about Dad hiring and firing employees. The valley had never recovered from the recession; people needed work. My parents were one of the largest employers in the county, but from what I could tell Dad's mental state made it difficult for him to maintain employees long-term: when he had a fit of paranoia, he tended to fire people with little cause. Months before, he had fired Diane Hardy, Rob's ex-wife, the same Rob who'd come to fetch us after the second accident. Diane and Rob had been friends with my parents for twenty years. Until Dad fired Diane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些年来，我听到很多关于我父母的传言：他们成了百万富翁，在山上建了一座堡垒，储藏了足够维持几十年的食物。目前为止，最有趣的莫过于父亲雇用和解雇员工的故事。山谷在经济萧条后再也未能复苏；人们需要工作。我父母是县里最大的雇主之一，但爸爸的精神状态令他难以长期留住员工：当他偏执发作时，他会因芝麻大的小事炒员工的鱿鱼。几个月前，他解雇了罗伯的前妻黛安·哈迪，就是第二次车祸时将我们接回去的那个罗伯。黛安和罗伯与我父母是二十年的老友，直到爸爸解雇了黛安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was perhaps in another such fit of paranoia that Dad fired my mother's sister Angie. Angie had spoken to Mother, believing her sister would never treat family that way. When I was a child it had been Mother's business; now it was hers and Dad's together. But at this test of whose it was really, my father won: Angie was dismissed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是另一次偏执发作时，爸爸开除了母亲的妹妹安琪。安琪对母亲说过，她相信自己的姐姐永远不会这样对待家人。在我小时候，这是母亲一个人的生意，现在成了她和爸爸共有的了。但在这场究竟谁才是真正的所有者的考验中，父亲赢了：安琪被解雇了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I pulled off the highway and onto the gravel, then stepped out of the car and gazed up at Buck's Peak. It was clear immediately that at least some of the rumors were true -- for one, that my parents were making huge sums of money. The house was massive. The home I'd grown up in had had five bedrooms; now it had been expanded in all directions and looked as though it had at least forty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我将车驶离高速公路，开上碎石路，然后下了车，抬头凝望巴克峰。我立刻明白，至少有些传言不虚——我的父母赚了很多钱。房子巨大。我成长的那个家曾经有五间卧室，现在房子向四面八方扩展，看上去至少有四十个房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is difficult to piece together what happened next, but from what I later learned, Angie filed for unemployment benefits, and when the Department of Labor called my parents to confirm that she had been terminated, Dad lost what little reason remained to him. It was not the Department of Labor on the phone, he said, but the Department of Homeland Security, pretending to be the Department of Labor. Angie had put his name on the terrorist watch list, he said. The Government was after him now -- after his money and his guns and his fuel. It was Ruby Ridge all over again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来发生的事很难拼凑起来，但就我后来所了解到的，安琪申请了失业救济金。当劳工部打电话向我父母确认她已被解雇时，父亲失去了他仅有的一点理智。他说，打来电话的不是劳工部，而是伪装成劳工部的国土安全部。他说，安琪已经把他的名字列入了恐怖分子观察名单。政府现在已经盯上了他——盯上了他的钱、枪支和汽油。鲁比山事件重新上演。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It would only be a matter of time, I thought, before Dad started using the money to prepare for the End of Days. I imagined the roof lined with solar panels, laid out like a deck of cards. "We need to be self-sufficient," I imagined Dad would say as he dragged the panels across his titanic house. In the coming year, Dad would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars buying equipment and scouring the mountain for water. He didn't want to be dependent on the Government, and he knew Buck's Peak must have water, if he could only find it. Gashes the size of football fields would appear at the mountain base, leaving a desolation of broken roots and upturned trees where once there had been a forest. He was probably chanting, "Got to be self-reliant" the day he climbed into a crawler and tore into the fields of satin wheat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想，爸爸迟早会用这些钱为世界末日做准备。我想象屋顶上的太阳能电池板像一副扑克牌一字排开。“我们需要自给自足。”我想象爸爸拖着电池板穿过巨大的房子时，会这样说。在接下来的一年里，爸爸会花费数十万美元购买设备，从山上寻找水源。他不想依赖政府，他知道巴克峰一定有水源，只要他能找到。山脚下会出现足球场那么大的裂缝，在曾经是森林的地方留下一片荒芜，到处是断裂的树根和倒下的树木。当他爬进一台履带式机器，撕碎一片缎子般的麦田时，可能嘴里还高喊着“得自力更生啊”。">查看中文翻译</div>

I soon realized that my not knowing her was wonderful for her children, who were bursting with remembrances and loved answering questions about her. With every story my grandmother came into sharper focus, but the woman taking shape from their collective memories was nothing like the woman I remembered.

<div class="line_en">My oldest brother, Tony, sat with my parents, his five children fanning out in the pew. Tony had a GED and had built a successful trucking company in Las Vegas, but it hadn't survived the recession. Now he worked for my parents, as did Shawn and Luke and their wives, as well as Audrey and her husband, Benjamin. Now I thought about it, I realized that all my siblings, except Richard and Tyler, were economically dependent on my parents. My family was splitting down the middle -- the three who had left the mountain, and the four who had stayed. The three with doctorates, and the four without high school diplomas. A chasm had appeared, and was growing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的大哥托尼和我父母坐在一起，他的五个孩子分散坐在长椅上。托尼拿到了普通同等学力证书，曾在拉斯维加斯开过一个成功的货运公司，但公司未能在经济萧条中挺住。现在他为父母打工，肖恩、卢克和他们各自的妻子，以及奥黛丽和她的丈夫本杰明都是如此。现在想来，我意识到除了理查德和泰勒，我所有的兄弟姐妹都在经济上依赖着我父母。我的家人从中间一分两半——三个离开了大山，四个留了下来。三个获得博士学位，四个没有高中文凭。裂痕已经出现，而且越来越深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shawn arrived a few minutes before the service, with Emily and Peter and a little girl I had never met. It was the first time I had been in a room with him since the night he'd killed Diego. I was tense, but there was no need. He did not look at me once during the service.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葬礼开始前几分钟，肖恩、埃米莉、彼得以及一个我从未见过的小女孩来了。自他杀死迭戈的那晚以来，这是我首次与他共处一室。我很紧张，但其实没有这个必要。整个葬礼期间他都没看我一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Audrey and Benjamin chose a bench near the back. Audrey had arrived early, when the chapel was empty. She had grabbed my arm and whispered that my refusing to see our father was a grave sin. "He is a great man," she said. "For the rest of your life you will regret not humbling yourself and following his counsel." These were the first words my sister had said to me in years, and I had no response to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥黛丽和本杰明选择了后面的长椅。奥黛丽很早就来了，当时教堂空无一人。她抓住我的胳膊，低声说，我拒绝跟父亲见面是严重的罪过。“他是一个了不起的人，”她说，“不虚心听他的劝告，你会后悔一辈子的。”这是多年来姐姐对我说的第一句话，而我没有回应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment it seemed pointless, this annual pilgrimage to a home that continued to reject me, and I wondered if I should go. Then I received another message, this one from Aunt Angie. She said Grandpa had canceled his plans for the next day, and was refusing even to go to the temple, as he usually did on Wednesdays, because he wanted to be at home in case I came by. To this Angie added: I get to see you in about twelve hours! But who's counting?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一刻，这一年一度的朝圣之旅似乎毫无意义。我正在考虑是否要离开，这时收到另一条消息，是安琪姨妈发来的。她说外公已经取消了第二天的计划，甚至连每星期三固定要去的神殿也不去了，因为他想在家等着，万一我路过呢。安琪还加上一句：再过十二个小时左右我就能见到你啦！但看看谁在计算时间呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few hours before my flight from London, I wrote to my mother -- as I always did, as I always will do -- to ask if she would see me. Again, her response was swift. She would not, she would never, unless I would see my father. To see me without him, she said, would be to disrespect her husband.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从伦敦起飞前几个小时，我写信给母亲——像往常一样，以后我也将一如既往地这样做——问她是否愿意见我。她再一次迅速回复。她不会见，永远不会，除非我愿意见父亲。她说，单独见我，是对丈夫的不尊重。">查看中文翻译</div>
