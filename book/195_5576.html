<div class="line_en">The conversation between Philip and Athelny was broken into by a clatter up the stairs. Athelny opened the door for the children coming back from Sunday school, and with laughter and shouting they came in. Gaily he asked them what they had learned. Sally appeared for a moment, with instructions from her mother that father was to amuse the children while she got tea ready; and Athelny began to tell them one of Hans Andersen's stories. They were not shy children, and they quickly came to the conclusion that Philip was not formidable. Jane came and stood by him and presently settled herself on his knees. It was the first time that Philip in his lonely life had been present in a family circle: his eyes smiled as they rested on the fair children engrossed in the fairy tale. The life of his new friend, eccentric as it appeared at first glance, seemed now to have the beauty of perfect naturalness. Sally came in once more.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Athelny brought in the tea. She sat down and proceeded to cut bread and butter. It amused Philip to see that she treated her husband as though he were a child. She spread jam for him and cut up the bread and butter into convenient slices for him to eat. She had taken off her hat; and in her Sunday dress, which seemed a little tight for her, she looked like one of the farmers' wives whom Philip used to call on sometimes with his uncle when he was a small boy. Then he knew why the sound of her voice was familiar to him. She spoke just like the people round Blackstable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿西尔尼夫人端茶进来了，刚一坐下就开始负责切面包和黄油。她把丈夫当成小孩一样照顾，看得一旁的菲利普直想笑。她先在面包上涂好果酱，又把面包和黄油切成一块块刚好入口的大小。她早就把帽子摘了，穿了一件自己最好的裙子，发福的身体被裹得紧紧的。菲利普觉得她看着像个农民的老婆，就像自己小时候经常和伯伯拜访的那些。难怪她的口音这么熟悉，原来她说起话来和布莱克斯塔布尔的人如此相像啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's a funny thing now," she said. "I was wondering in Church just now whether you was any connection of Mr. Carey. Many's the time I've seen 'im. A cousin of mine married Mr. Barker of Roxley Farm, over by Blackstable Church, and I used to go and stay there often when I was a girl. Isn't that a funny thing now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这可有意思啦，”她说，“我刚才做礼拜的时候还想呢，你会不会是凯利先生的亲戚。我以前老能看见他。我的一个表妹就嫁给了维克斯利农场的巴克先生，那个农场就在布莱克斯塔布尔教堂旁边。我还是个小女孩的时候，就总是去那个教堂。是不是很有意思呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sally never pays any attention to me," laughed Athelny, looking at her with fond, proud eyes. "She goes about her business indifferent to wars, revolutions, and cataclysms. What a wife she'll make to an honest man!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“萨莉从来不搭理我的话。”阿西尔尼大笑起来，用骄傲、疼爱的眼神看着女儿，“不管外面世界发生战争、改革还是大变动，她都满不在乎，只顾干好自己的。等找到一个靠得住的男人嫁了，她会是个多好的妻子！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at him with a new interest, and a brightness came into her faded eyes. She asked him whether he knew Ferne. It was a pretty village about ten miles across country from Blackstable, and the Vicar had come over sometimes to Blackstable for the harvest thanksgiving. She mentioned names of various farmers in the neighbourhood. She was delighted to talk again of the country in which her youth was spent, and it was a pleasure to her to recall scenes and people that had remained in her memory with the tenacity peculiar to her class. It gave Philip a queer sensation too. A breath of the country-side seemed to be wafted into that panelled room in the middle of London. He seemed to see the fat Kentish fields with their stately elms; and his nostrils dilated with the scent of the air; it is laden with the salt of the North Sea, and that makes it keen and sharp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她似乎对菲利普有了新的兴趣，原本黯淡的眸子忽地亮了起来。她问他知不知道弗内。那是个风景宜人的小村庄，离布莱克斯塔布尔大概有十英里远，中间隔着一大片田野。有时村上的牧师也会去布莱克斯塔布尔过感恩节。她谈起几个住在附近的农夫和村庄里的趣事儿，心里特别激动。乡下的风土人情被她如数家珍般娓娓道来，这副好记性对于一个从小在农村长大的女孩来说，可谓非常罕见。菲利普也觉得莫名心动。一阵来自乡下的和风暖流徐徐吹进这间位于伦敦市中心、镶着墙板的小屋。眼前仿佛看见肯特郡肥沃无际的田野，排排榆木立在四周，直指天空。空气清新宜人，弥漫着花草的清香，又掺杂着自北海吹来的淡淡咸味，冰冷刺骨，却让人不由大口大口贪婪地呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip did not leave the Athelnys' till ten o'clock. The children came in to say good-night at eight and quite naturally put up their faces for Philip to kiss. His heart went out to them. Sally only held out her hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the following Saturday Philip received a postcard from Athelny saying that they were expecting him to dinner next day; but fearing their means were not such that Mr. Athelny would desire him to accept, Philip wrote back that he would only come to tea. He bought a large plum cake so that his entertainment should cost nothing. He found the whole family glad to see him, and the cake completed his conquest of the children. He insisted that they should all have tea together in the kitchen, and the meal was noisy and hilarious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了下个礼拜六，菲利普收到阿西尔尼寄来的明信片，上面写到希望他明天能一起过来吃顿饭。菲利普害怕这样的盛情款待会让阿西尔尼在经济上吃不消，所以回信说他只过去喝点茶就好。第二天，他去的时候带上了一个大大的葡萄干蛋糕，这样一来招待他喝茶就花不了阿西尔尼什么钱了。他欣喜地发现这一家人见到他都很高兴，而带去的大蛋糕也立刻就征服了那帮小孩子。他坚持要在厨房和大家伙一起喝茶，所有人吵吵闹闹，其乐融融，气氛好得不得了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Athelny was very communicative, and little by little Philip learned the various stages of his life. He had followed many occupations, and it occurred to Philip that he managed to make a mess of everything he attempted. He had been on a tea plantation in Ceylon and a traveller in America for Italian wines; his secretaryship of the water company in Toledo had lasted longer than any of his employments; he had been a journalist and for some time had worked as police-court reporter for an evening paper; he had been sub-editor of a paper in the Midlands and editor of another on the Riviera. From all his occupations he had gathered amusing anecdotes, which he told with a keen pleasure in his own powers of entertainment. He had read a great deal, chiefly delighting in books which were unusual; and he poured forth his stores of abstruse knowledge with child-like enjoyment of the amazement of his hearers. Three or four years before abject poverty had driven him to take the job of press-representative to a large firm of drapers; and though he felt the work unworthy his abilities, which he rated highly, the firmness of his wife and the needs of his family had made him stick to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿西尔尼是个非常健谈的人，通过聊天，菲利普逐渐听说了他人生中各个阶段的故事。他尝试过很多职业，菲利普忽然想到他不管做什么，最后肯定都是留下一堆烂摊子。他曾经在斯里兰卡的茶庄干过，还在美国到处推销意大利红酒；在托莱多水厂的那份工作已经是干得最久的了；他还当过新闻记者，有一阵子专门给一家晚报报道治安法庭的消息。还在英国中部的一家报社当过副编辑，在里维埃拉的另一家报社做编辑。他从这些工作里搜集了各种招人发笑的奇闻逸事，兴致勃勃地讲给客人听。他书也读了不少，尤其喜欢读些不常见的书。把书里难以理解的知识拿出来侃侃而谈，看着自己的听众一脸惊讶，就不由沾沾自喜，乐得像个小孩。有那么三四年的时间，他实在是穷得走投无路，只好做了一家布商的新闻代理。虽然这份工作屈了他的才气（他总把自己说得才华横溢），可由于老婆的一再坚持，还有一家人等着他养活，也只能继续干下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon Philip got into the habit of going to Athelny's every Sunday. He became a great favourite with the children, because he was simple and unaffected and because it was so plain that he was fond of them. As soon as they heard his ring at the door one of them popped a head out of window to make sure it was he, and then they all rushed downstairs tumultuously to let him in. They flung themselves into his arms. At tea they fought for the privilege of sitting next to him. Soon they began to call him Uncle Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久，菲利普就养成了在阿西尔尼家过周末的习惯。他为人诚恳、单纯，很快就成了小孩儿最喜欢的人，而他也自然格外喜欢这些孩子。只要他一摁门铃，就有一颗小脑袋从窗户钻出来看看是不是他到了，一经确认，所有孩子都会冲下楼梯抢着给他开门。他们一股脑儿地扑到他怀里，喝茶的时候争着要坐他旁边。很快，小家伙们就管他叫菲利普叔叔了。">查看中文翻译</div>
