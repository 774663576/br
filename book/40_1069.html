<div class="line_en">The Walayat women's prison was a drab, square-shaped building in Shar-e-Nau near Chicken Street. It sat in the center of a larger complex that housed male inmates. A padlocked door separated Mariam and the other women from the surrounding men. Mariam counted five working cells. They were unfurnished rooms, with dirty, peeling walls, and small windows that looked into the courtyard. The windows were barred, even though the doors to the cells were unlocked and the women were free to come and go to the courtyard as they pleased. The windows had no glass. There were no curtains either, which meant the Talib guards who roamed the courtyard had an eyeful of the interior of the cells. Some of the women complained that the guards smoked outside the window and leered in, with their inflamed eyes and wolfish smiles, that they muttered indecent jokes to each other about them. Because of this, most of the women wore burqas all day and lifted them only after sundown, after the main gate was locked and the guards had gone to their posts.</div>

<div class="line_en">At night, the cell Mariam shared with five women and four children was dark. On those nights when there was electrical power, they hoisted Naghma, a short, flat-chested girl with black frizzy hair, up to the ceiling. There was a wire there from which the coating had been stripped. Naghma would hand-wrap the live wire around the base of the lightbulb then to make a circuit.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the prison was an open, rectangular courtyard, and, in the middle of that, a well. The well had no drainage, meaning the courtyard was often a swamp and the water tasted rotten. Laundry lines, loaded with hand-washed socks and diapers, slashed across each other in the courtyard. This was where inmates met visitors, where they boiled the rice their families brought them -- the prison provided no food. The courtyard was also the children's playground -- Mariam had learned that many of the children had been born in Walayat, had never seen the world outside these walls. Mariam watched them chase each other around, watched their shoeless feet sling mud. All day, they ran around, making up lively games, unaware of the stench of feces and urine that permeated Walayat and their own bodies, unmindful of the Talib guards until one smacked them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女子监狱中央是一个露天的长方形院子，院子中央是一口水井。水井没有排水口，这意味着院子里通常积满了水，井水有一股腐烂的味道。院子里拉满了相互交叉的晾衣线，上面挂着手洗的袜子和尿片。这里也是女囚会见访客的地方，她们就在这儿用亲友买来的大米煮饭——监狱不提供食物。这个院子也是孩子们的游乐场——玛丽雅姆已经知道有好几个孩子是在瓦拉雅特里面出生的，从来没有见过高墙之外的世界。玛丽雅姆看着他们相互追逐，看着他们没穿鞋子的脚丫踩进泥土。瓦拉雅特弥漫着屎尿的臭味，这些孩子身上也是臭烘烘的，但他们对此毫不在乎，也不理会那些塔利班士兵，只顾整天跑来跑去，乐此不疲地玩游戏，直到被塔利班殴打方肯罢休。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you fully understand what you're saying?" the bony-faced Talib to the judge's right, not the tea giver, said. This one was the youngest of the three.

<div class="line_en">The man nodded. Or maybe he didn't. It was hard to tell; he had a pronounced shaking of his hands and head that reminded Mariam of Mullah Faizullah's tremor. When he sipped tea, he did not reach for his cup. He motioned to the square-shouldered man to his left, who respectfully brought it to his lips. After, the Talib closed his eyes gently, a muted and elegant gesture of gratitude.</div>

<div class="line_en">MARIAM SPENT TEN DAYS in prison. She sat by the window of the cell, watched the prison life in the courtyard. When the summer winds blew, she watched bits of scrap paper ride the currents in a frenzied, corkscrew motion, as they were hurled this way and that, high above the prison walls. She watched the winds stir mutiny in the dust, whipping it into violent spirals that ripped through the courtyard. Everyone -- the guards, the inmates, the children, Mariam -- burrowed their faces in the hook of their elbows, but the dust would not be denied. It made homes of ear canals and nostrils, of eyelashes and skin folds, of the space between molars. Only at dusk did the winds die down. And then if a night breeze blew, it did so timidly, as if to atone for the excesses of its daytime sibling.</div>

Mullah Faizullah twirling his rosary beads, walking with her along the stream, their twin shadows gliding on the water and on the grassy banks sprinkled with a blue-lavender wild iris that, in this dream, smelled like cloves. She dreamed of Nana in the doorway of the kolba, her voice dim and distant, calling her to dinner, as Mariam played in cool, tangled grass where ants crawled and beetles scurried and grasshoppers skipped amid all the different shades of green. The squeak of a wheelbarrow laboring up a dusty path. Cowbells clanging. Sheep baaing on a hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后那个晚上，玛丽雅姆做了一些并不连贯的梦。她梦见一些石头，总共十一块，排成一列。扎里勒又变得年轻了，脸上挂着胜利的微笑，下巴笑出一道缝，身上有几块汗渍，外套甩在肩膀上；他终于开着那辆闪亮的别克路王轿车来接走他的女儿了。法苏拉赫毛拉转动念珠，和她一起沿着山溪走，他们两人的影子滑过水面，滑过长满青草的溪岸，溪岸上散落着一些蓝紫色的野生鸢尾花，在梦中，它们发出丁香的芬芳。玛丽雅姆还梦到娜娜站在泥屋的门口，用听起来微弱而遥远的声音呼唤她回家吃晚饭；而她则在一片凉爽的杂草丛中玩耍，那儿有慢慢爬行的蚂蚁、匆匆移动的甲虫和到处跳来跳去的蚱蜢。有人费劲地推着一辆独轮车沿着泥路上山，发出辘辘的声音。牛脖子上的铜铃叮当、叮当响。绵羊在山坡上咩咩叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THOUSANDS OF EYES bore down on her. In the crowded bleachers, necks were craned for the benefit of a better view. Tongues clucked. A murmuring sound rippled through the stadium when Mariam was helped down from the truck. Mariam imagined heads shaking when the loudspeaker announced her crime. But she did not look up to see whether they were shaking with disapproval or charity, with reproach or pity. Mariam blinded herself to them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上千双眼睛盯着她看。露天看台人头涌动，人们为了看得清楚一点而伸直了脖子。有人啪嗒着舌头。当玛丽雅姆被人从卡车上扶下来时，一阵窃窃私语掠过整个体育馆。扬声器宣布了她的罪名，玛丽雅姆想像人们摇晃着脑袋。但她没有抬起头来看他们摇头时究竟是带着反对还是仁慈、谴责或是怜悯。玛丽雅姆不去看所有这些人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Earlier that morning, she had been afraid that she would make a fool of herself, that she would turn into a pleading, weeping spectacle. She had feared that she might scream or vomit or even wet herself, that, in her last moments, she would be betrayed by animal instinct or bodily disgrace. But when she was made to descend from the truck, Mariam's legs did not buckle. Her arms did not flail. She did not have to be dragged. And when she did feel herself faltering, she thought of Zalmai, from whom she had taken the love of his life, whose days now would be shaped by the sorrow of his father's disappearance. And then Mariam's stride steadied and she could walk without protest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨，玛丽雅姆曾害怕自己会出丑，害怕她会不顾一切地哀求哭喊。她担心自己可能会尖叫、呕吐甚至屎尿直流；也担心在生命最后的时刻，动物本能或身体痛楚会背叛她。但当她被迫走下卡车的时候，玛丽雅姆的双腿没有变软。她的手臂没有挥舞。她无需被人拖下车。当察觉到自己站不稳的时候，她想起了察尔迈伊。她夺走了察尔迈伊生命中的爱，父亲的失踪将会给他今后的日子蒙上一层忧伤的阴影。然后玛丽雅姆的步伐变得坚定起来，不用别人扶着也能走路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though there had been moments of beauty in it, Mariam knew that life for the most part had been unkind to her. But as she walked the final twenty paces, she could not help but wish for more of it. She wished she could see Laila again, wished to hear the clangor of her laugh, to sit with her once more for a pot of chai and leftover halwa under a starlit sky. She mourned that she would never see Aziza grow up, would not see the beautiful young woman that she would one day become, would not get to paint her hands with henna and toss noqul candy at her wedding. She would never play with Aziza's children. She would have liked that very much, to be old and play with Aziza's children.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam's final thoughts were a few words from the Koran, which she muttered under her breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆最后想到的是《古兰经》上的几句经文，她默默地在心中念诵：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He has created the heavens and the earth with the truth; He makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake the night, and He has made the sun and the moon subservient; each one runs on to an assigned term; now surely He is the Mighty, the Great Forgiver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用真理创造了天地；他让黑夜覆盖白天，让白天接管黑夜；他让日月循规蹈矩，各自依照划定的轨道运转；所以他确实无所不能，是伟大的宽恕者。[1]【注：[1]见《古兰经》第39章。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam wished for so much in those final moments. Yet as she closed her eyes, it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her. She thought of her entry into this world, the harami child of a lowly villager, an unintended thing, a pitiable, regrettable accident. A weed. And yet she was leaving the world as a woman who had loved and been loved back. She was leaving it as a friend, a companion, a guardian. A mother. A person of consequence at last. No. It was not so bad, Mariam thought, that she should die this way. Not so bad. This was a legitimate end to a life of illegitimate beginnings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这最后一刻，玛丽雅姆燃起了这么多希望。然而，当她闭上双眼，她心中再也没有懊悔，而是充满了一阵安宁的感觉。她想到她进入这个世界的身份，一个低贱的乡下人所生的哈拉米，一件人们不想要的东西，一次可怜的、后悔莫及的事故。一棵杂草。然而，当她即将离开这个世界的时候，她是一个付出了爱也得到了爱的女人。她以朋友、同伴、监护人的身份离开这个世界。以母亲的身份。她终究成了别人眼中的重要人物。不。这样死去并不算糟糕，玛丽雅姆想。不算太糟糕。对于一段开头不合法的人生来说，这是一个合法的结局。">查看中文翻译</div>
