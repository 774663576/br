<div class="line_en">Like me, Emily loved old American popular songs. She'd go more for the up-tempo numbers, like Irving Berlin's "Cheek to Cheek" and Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine," while I'd lean towards the bitter-sweet ballads --"Here's That Rainy Day" or "It Never Entered My Mind." But there was a big overlap, and anyway, back then, on a university campus in the south of England, it was a near-miracle to find anyone else who shared such passions. Today, a young person's likely to listen to any sort of music. My nephew, who starts university this autumn, is going through his Argentinian tango phase. He also likes Edith Piaf as well as any number of the latest indie bands. But in our day tastes weren't nearly so diverse. My fellow students fell into two broad camps: the hippie types with their long hair and flowing garments who liked "progressive rock," and the neat, tweedy ones who considered anything other than classical music a horrible din. Occasionally you'd bump into someone who professed to be into jazz, but this would always turn out to be of the so-called crossover kind -- endless improvisations with no respect for the beautifully crafted songs used as their starting points.</div>

<div class="line_en">In that first year, Emily lived in college, and she had in her room a portable record player, a type that was quite common then. It looked like a large hat box, with pale-blue leatherette surfaces and a single built-in speaker. Only when you raised its lid would you see the turntable sitting inside. It gave out a pretty primitive sound by today's standards, but I remember us crouching around it happily for hours, taking off one track, carefully lowering the needle down onto another. We loved playing different versions of the same song, then arguing about the lyrics, or about the singers' interpretations. Was that line really supposed to be sung so ironically? Was it better to sing "Georgia on My Mind" as though Georgia was a woman or the place in America? We were especially pleased when we found a recording -- like Ray Charles singing "Come Rain or Come Shine"-- where the words themselves were happy, but the interpretation was pure heartbreak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一年埃米莉住在学校里，她的宿舍里有一台便携式唱片机，当时很常见的那种。长得像个大帽盒，浅蓝色人造皮的面，一个内嵌式喇叭。打开盖子以后才能看见里面的唱机转盘。按今天的标准来讲，它发出来的声音够原始的，可我记得我们常常一连几个小时愉快地蹲在唱片机旁，把一张唱片拿下来，再小心翼翼地把唱针放到另一张上面。我们喜欢放同一首歌的不同版本，然后争论歌词或歌手的演绎。那句歌词是应该唱得这么讽刺吗？唱《乔治亚在我心》这歌应该把乔治亚当作个女人还是美国的一个地方？若发现一首歌——比如雷·查尔斯[8]演唱的《不论下雨或晴天》——歌词本身是快乐的，而演唱成十分悲伤，我们会特别高兴。【注：[8] 美国黑人盲歌手，被誉为“灵魂乐之父”。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So it was a relief to discover someone else, and a girl at that, who appreciated the Great American Songbook. Like me, Emily collected LPs with sensitive, straightforward vocal interpretations of the standards -- you could often find such records going cheap in junk shops, discarded by our parents' generation. She favoured Sarah Vaughan and Chet Baker. I preferred Julie London and Peggy Lee. Neither of us was big on Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以发现有人也喜欢美国爵士金曲，还是个女生，真是欣慰。和我一样，埃米莉也喜欢收集敏感、坦率的声音翻唱的经典曲目的唱片——这类唱片要么在旧货店里慢慢贬值，要么被父辈们丢弃。她喜欢萨拉·沃恩[4]和切特·贝克。我偏好朱莉·伦敦[5]和佩吉·李[6]。我们俩都对辛纳特拉或埃拉·菲茨杰拉德[7]不太感冒。【注：[4] 美国著名爵士乐女歌手。[5] 美国著名女歌手。[6] 美国爵士乐女歌手、作曲家、演员。[7] 美国著名爵士乐女歌手，被誉为“爵士乐第一夫人”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emily's love of these records was obviously so deep that I'd be taken aback each time I stumbled on her talking to other students about some pretentious rock band or vacuous Californian singer-songwriter. At times, she'd start arguing about a "concept" album in much the way she and I would discuss Gershwin or Harold Arlen, and then I'd have to bite my lip not to show my irritation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back then, Emily was slim and beautiful, and if she hadn't settled on Charlie so early in her university career, I'm sure she'd have had a whole bunch of men competing for her. But she was never flirty or tarty, so once she was with Charlie, the other suitors backed off.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charlie was my best friend at university. During that first year, we hung around together the whole time and that was how I'd come to know Emily. In the second year, Charlie and Emily got a house-share down in town, and though I was a frequent visitor, those discussions with Emily around her record player became a thing of the past. For a start, whenever I called round to the house, there were several other students sitting around, laughing and talking, and there was now a fancy stereo system churning out rock music you had to shout over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理是我大学时最好的朋友。一年级时我们成天在一起，因此我才认识了埃米莉。第二年，查理和埃米莉在城里找了间房子同居。虽然我常常去他们那，但是那些与埃米莉在唱片机旁的交谈已经成为往事。一来，我每次去，都有几个其他同学坐在那里又说又笑。再者，如今有了一台漂亮的立体声音响大声地播放着摇滚乐，说话都得用喊的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I first took up English teaching after university, it seemed a good enough life -- much like an extension of university. Language schools were mushrooming all over Europe, and if the teaching was tedious and the hours exploitative, at that age you don't care too much. You spend a lot of time in bars, friends are easy to make, and there's a feeling you're part of a large network extending around the entire globe. You meet people fresh from their spells in Peru or Thailand, and this gets you thinking that if you wanted to, you could drift around the world indefinitely, using your contacts to get a job in any faraway corner you fancied. And always you'd be part of this cosy, extended family of itinerant teachers, swapping stories over drinks about former colleagues, psychotic school directors, eccentric British Council officers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大学毕业后我选择了教英语，刚开始貌似还不错——很像大学生活的延伸。语言学校在欧洲如雨后春笋般涌现。若说教书很无聊、课酬很低，那个年纪的你不会太在乎。你泡在酒吧里，很容易就交到朋友，感觉自己是一个遍布全球的巨大网络的一部分。你会遇见刚从秘鲁或泰国教了一阵子书回来的人，你会觉得只要你愿意就可以满世界跑，就可以利用你的关系在哪个你向往的遥远的角落找到一份工作。而且你永远是这个舒适的巡回教师大家庭的一分子，一边喝酒一边聊着以前的同事、神经质的学校主管、英国文化协会里的怪人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charlie and I have remained close friends through the years. We may not see each other as much as we once did, but that's mainly down to distances. I've spent years here in Spain, as well as in Italy and Portugal, while Charlie's always based himself in London. Now if that makes it sound like I'm the jet-setter and he's the stay-at-home, that would be funny. Because in fact Charlie's the one who's always flying off -- to Texas, Tokyo, New York -- to his high-powered meetings, while I've been stuck in the same humid buildings year after year, setting spelling tests or conducting the same conversations in slowed-down English. My-name-is-Ray. What-is-your-name? Do-you-have-children?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些年来查理和我还是好朋友。确实我们不如以前那样常见面，但这主要是因为距离太远。我在意大利、葡萄牙，还有西班牙这里待了好几年，而查理则一直待在伦敦。要是这么说让你觉得好像我是个空中飞人，他是个宅男，那就好笑了。因为查理才是整天飞来飞去的人——得克萨斯、东京、纽约——参加一个个高端会议，而我则年复一年困在潮湿的房子里，安排拼写测试，或者重复着一成不变的慢速英语谈话：“我叫雷。”“你叫什么？”“你有孩子吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the late '80s, there was talk of making a lot of money teaching in Japan, and I made serious plans to go, but it never worked out. I thought about Brazil too, even read a few books about the culture and sent off for application forms. But somehow I never got away that far. Southern Italy, Portugal for a short spell, back here to Spain. Then before you know it, you're forty-seven years old, and the people you started out with have long ago been replaced by a generation who gossip about different things, take different drugs and listen to different music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="八十年代末期听说去日本教书很赚钱，我认真地计划要去，但最终没去成。我还想过去巴西，甚至读了一些介绍那里的文化的书，要了申请表。可不知为什么我从来没有去那么远的地方。我只去意大利南部、葡萄牙教了一阵子书，又回到西班牙。不知不觉就到了四十七岁，身边共事的人早就变成了聊不同话题、嗑不同药、听不同音乐的另一代人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, Charlie and Emily had married and settled down in London. Charlie told me once, when they had children I'd be godfather to one of them. But that never happened. What I mean is, a child never came along, and now I suppose it's too late. I have to admit, I've always felt slightly let down about this. Perhaps I always imagined that being godfather to one of their children would provide an official link, however tenuous, between their lives in England and mine out here.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, at the start of this summer, I went to London to stay with them. It had been arranged well in advance, and when I'd phoned to check a couple of days beforehand, Charlie had said they were both "superbly well." That's why I'd no reason to expect anything other than pampering and relaxation after a few months that hadn't exactly been the best in my life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总而言之，今年初夏，我去了伦敦待在他们那里。事情已经事先安排妥当，动身前两天，我打电话确认时，查理说他们俩都“很好”。所以我一心只想着在经历了肯定不是我人生最美好的几个月后好好休息、放松一下，根本没想到别的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, as I emerged out of their local Underground that sunny day, my thoughts were on the possible refinements that might have been added to "my" bedroom since the previous visit. Over the years, there's almost always been something or other. One time it was some gleaming electronic gadget standing in the corner; another time the whole place had been redecorated. In any case, almost as a point of principle, the room would be prepared for me the way a posh hotel would go about things: towels laid out, a bedside tin of biscuits, a selection of CDs on the dressing table. A few years ago, Charlie had led me in and with nonchalant pride started flicking switches, causing all sorts of subtly hidden lights to go on and off: behind the headboard, above the wardrobe and so on. Another switch had triggered a growling hum and blinds had begun to descend over the two windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，那个阳光灿烂的早晨，当我走出伦敦地铁站时，脑子里想着：不知自从我上次来了以后，他们会对“我的”房间做怎样的改进。这些年来，几乎每次都有不一样的东西。有一次，房间的角落里摆着一个闪着光的电子小玩意儿；还有一次，整个房间都重新装修过了。但不管怎样，几乎有一条基本原则，他们按着高级旅馆的样子为我布置房间：摆好毛巾，床头放着一小罐饼干，梳妆台上备着几张CD。几年前，查理带我走进房间，若无其事地炫耀着打开各种开关，各种巧妙地隐藏起来的灯开了关、关了开：床头板后面、衣橱上面等等。还有一个开关按了以后，隆隆隆，两扇窗户上的百叶窗慢慢放了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

We didn't have a reservation, but the waiters greeted Charlie like a friend and led us to a table.

She was sitting on the living-room sofa reading the Financial Times, and got up rather glumly as I came in.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I woke up, the afternoon sun was coming into the flat. Getting off the sofa, I began a little nose-around. Perhaps the cleaners had indeed been in during our lunch, or maybe Emily had done the tidying herself; in any case, the large living room was looking pretty immaculate. Tidiness aside, it had been stylishly done up, with modern designer furniture and arty objects -- though someone being unkind might have said it was all too obviously for effect. I took a browse through the books, then glanced through the CD collection. It was almost entirely rock or classical, but finally, after some searching, I found tucked away in the shadows a small section devoted to Fred Astaire, Chet Baker, Sarah Vaughan. It puzzled me that Emily hadn't replaced more of her treasured vinyl collection with their CD reincarnations, but I didn't dwell on this, and wandered off into the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一觉醒来，午后的太阳正照进公寓。我从沙发上起来，开始东看看西看看。可能是清洁工在我们外出吃午饭的时候真的来过了，也可能是埃米莉自个儿打扫了，总之现在偌大的客厅看上去一尘不染。客厅不仅是干净，还很有品位，摆设着时髦的家具和艺术品——虽然刻薄的人可能会说太做作了。我扫了一眼摆着的图书，然后是CD。基本上全是摇滚和古典乐，可经过一番搜寻，我在角落里找到了几张弗雷德·阿斯泰尔[11]、切特·贝克和萨拉·沃恩的CD。我奇怪埃米莉怎么没有把其他她珍爱的唱片也换成CD，但我没有在CD这里停留太久，而是溜达去了厨房。【注：[11] 美国演员，被誉为歌舞之王。】">查看中文翻译</div>

And that's exactly what I did this time, after Emily had left. Or at least, I managed to read a couple of chapters of Mansfield Park before dozing off for twenty minutes or so.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was opening up a few cupboards in search of biscuits or a chocolate bar when I noticed what seemed to be a small notebook on the kitchen table. It had purple cushioned covers, which made it stand out amidst the sleek minimalist surfaces of the kitchen. Emily, in a big hurry just before she'd left, had been emptying and re-filling her bag on the table while I'd been drinking my tea. Obviously she'd left the notebook behind by mistake. But then in almost the next instant another idea came to me: that this purple book was some kind of intimate diary, and Emily had left it there on purpose, fully intending for me to have a peek; that for whatever reason, she'd felt unable to confide more openly, so had resorted to this way of sharing her inner turmoil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打开碗橱找饼干、巧克力什么的，突然看见厨房的桌子上有一本小记事本。带衬垫的紫色封面在光滑而极其简洁的厨房里特别显眼。刚刚我喝茶时，埃米莉匆匆忙忙地准备出门，把包里的东西统统倒到桌子上，再重新装进去。一定是那个时候落下的。可马上另一种念头出现在我脑子里：这个紫色的小本子是一本私密日记，是埃米莉故意留下来要我看的；出于某种原因，她无法公开表达她的感受，于是用这种方式来倾诉她内心的混乱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stood there for a while, staring at the notebook. Then I reached forward, inserted my forefinger into the pages at the mid-way point and gingerly levered it up. The sight of Emily's closely packed handwriting inside made me pull my finger out, and I moved away from the table, telling myself I had no business nosing in there, never mind what Emily had intended in an irrational moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站在那儿盯着记事本。过了一会儿，我走上前去，把食指伸进记事本当中，小心翼翼地翻开。埃米莉挤挤挨挨的字映入我的眼帘，我一下子把手收了回来，离开餐桌，告诉自己我不应该偷看埃米莉的本子，不管她一时昏了头想干什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With that, Charlie was gone. I slumped down into the sofa and took a deep breath. I told myself I had to keep things in proportion, but all the while I could feel in my stomach a vaguely nauseous sensation of panic. Various ideas ran through my mind. One solution was simply to flee the apartment, and have no contact with Charlie and Emily for several years, after which I'd send them a cautious, carefully worded letter. Even in my current state, I dismissed this plan as being a touch too desperate. A better plan was that I steadily work through the bottles in their drinks cabinet, so that when Emily arrived home, she'd find me pathetically drunk. Then I could claim to have looked through her diary and attacked the pages in an alcoholic delirium. In fact, in my drunken unreasonableness, I could even adopt the role of the injured party, shouting and pointing, telling her how bitterly hurt I'd been to read those words about me, written by someone whose love and friendship I'd always counted on, the thought of which had helped sustain me through my lousiest moments in strange and lonely countries. But while this plan had points to recommend it from a practical aspect, I could sense something there -- something near the bottom of it, something I didn't care to examine too closely -- that I knew would make it an impossibility for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说完，查理把电话挂了。我倒进沙发里，深深地吸了一口气。我告诉自己要理智，可是我心里一直感到隐隐的害怕。我想了各种各样的办法。一种办法是就这么溜之大吉，几年都不再跟查理和埃米莉联系，几年以后我会写一封措词谨慎的信来。即便事已至此，我也觉得这么做太绝望了。好一点的办法是我把他们柜子里的酒一瓶瓶喝掉，等埃米莉回来的时候就会发现我烂醉如泥了。那时我就告诉她我看了她的日记，在酒精的作用下把纸张给捏了。而且，我还可以借着酒疯扮演受害者的角色。我可以冲她嚷嚷，指指点点，告诉她看了她写的话我受了多么深的伤害。我是多么珍视她的爱意和友谊，是她支撑我在孤独的异乡度过那些最难过的日子。可她却那样子说我。虽然这个计划挺可行的，但我隐隐觉得这里头——在这个计划的底下，有什么东西是我不敢去碰的——所以这个计划对我来说也行不通。">查看中文翻译</div>

About a year ago, we had this coffee-table book, cost a fortune, full of arty pictures of young gay men posing in North African casbahs. Emily liked to keep it open at this particular page, she thought it went with the sofa. She'd go mad if you turned over the page. Anyway, about a year ago, Hendrix came in and chewed it all up.

Next I selected a good spot near the coffee table to "knock over" the wastepaper basket. I went about my work in a strange, disembodied mode.

<div class="line_en">"Good. You're coming round to it. Get a pen, Ray. Write this down. Ah, here it comes at last." He must have put the phone in his pocket, because for the next few moments I listened to womb noises. Then he came back and said:</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have to go now. So write this down. Are you ready? The middle-sized saucepan. It's probably on the stove already. Put about a pint of water in it. Add two beef stock cubes, one dessertspoon of cumin, one tablespoon of paprika, two tablespoons of vinegar, a generous lot of bay leaves. Got that? Now you put in there a leather shoe or boot, upside down, so the sole's not actually immersed in the liquid. That's so you don't get any hint of burning rubber. Then you turn on the gas, bring the concoction to the boil, let it sit there simmering. Pretty soon, you'll notice the smell. It's not an awful smell. Tony Barton's original recipe involved garden slugs, but this one's much more subtle. Just like a smelly dog. I know, you're going to ask me where to find the ingredients. All the herbs and stuff are in the kitchen cupboards. If you go to the under-stairs cupboard, you'll find a discarded pair of boots in there. Not the wellingtons. I mean the battered-up pair, they're more like built-up shoes. I used to wear them all the time on the common. They've had it and they're waiting for the heave. Take one of those. What's the matter? Look, Ray, you just do this, okay? Save yourself. Because I'm telling you, an angry Emily is no joke. I've got to go now. Oh, and remember. No showing off your wonderful musical knowledge."</div>

The sky wasn't fully dark yet, but was already filling with stars. Beyond the wall that marked the end of the terrace, I could see for miles around the windows and back yards of the neighbouring properties. A lot of the windows were lit, and the ones in the distance, if you narrowed your eyes, looked almost like an extension of the stars. This roof terrace wasn't large, but there was definitely something romantic about it.

<div class="line_en">I went into the room in a crouched posture, so as to see it from something like Hendrix's eyeline. Immediately, the glossy magazines piled up on the coffee table revealed themselves as an obvious target, and so I pushed them off the surface along a trajectory consistent with a shove from a rampant muzzle. The way the magazines landed on the floor looked satisfyingly authentic. Encouraged, I knelt down, opened one of the magazines and scrunched up a page in a manner, I hoped, would find an echo when eventually Emily came across the diary. But this time the result was disappointing: too obviously the work of a human hand rather than canine teeth. I'd fallen into my earlier error again: I'd not merged sufficiently with Hendrix.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我弯着腰走进客厅，以便更好地从亨德里克斯的视角来看东西。我一眼就看见咖啡几上的那堆杂志是最明显的目标。于是我一把把书扫了出去，就像一只畜牲用嘴甩出去的一样。书掉在地板上的样子看起来很真实。我受到了鼓舞，跪下来，翻开一本杂志，揉碎其中的一页，希望能模仿日记本的效果，但结果并不理想：一看就是人手弄的，不像狗的牙齿弄的。我又犯了之前的错误：我还没有完全把自己当作亨德里克斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could have stayed out there a lot longer, but I was afraid of losing my momentum. I went back into the kitchen, and walking past the bubbling pot, paused at the threshold of the living room to survey my earlier work. The big mistake, it struck me, lay in my complete failure to consider the task from the perspective of a creature like Hendrix. The key, I now realised, was to immerse myself within Hendrix's spirit and vision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我本可以再多待一会儿，但我怕我的干劲消失，就回到厨房里，走过冒着泡的锅，走到客厅的入口，端详着我之前的布置。突然，我意识到我犯了一个大错，我完全没有从亨德里克斯的角度来想问题。现在我明白了事情的关键是把自己当作亨德里克斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once I'd started on this tack, I saw not only the inadequacy of my previous efforts, but how hopeless most of Charlie's suggestions had been. Why would an over-lively dog extract a little ox ornament from the midst of hi-fi equipment and smash it? And the idea of cutting open the sofa and throwing around the stuffing was idiotic. Hendrix would need razor teeth to achieve an effect like that. The capsized sugar bowl in the kitchen was fine, but the living room, I realised, would have to be re-conceptualised from scratch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么一来，我发现不仅我之前的努力全是白费，而且查理的建议大多都没有用。一只精力过剩的狗怎么会从音响中间把一只小瓷牛拔出来砸碎呢？割开沙发、掏出海绵这事儿也太不现实了。亨德里克斯得有剃刀般的牙齿才能做到。厨房里弄翻糖罐的主意还行，可是我发现客厅得完全重新布置。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I think it was because I'd become so absorbed in these finer points that I didn't become aware sooner of Emily standing out in the hall, watching me from just beyond the doorway. Once I did realise she was there, my first feeling wasn't one of panic or embarrassment, but of hurt that she should be standing there like that without having announced her arrival in some way. In fact, when I remembered how I'd gone to the trouble of calling her office only several minutes earlier precisely to pre-empt the sort of situation now engulfing me, I felt the victim of a deliberate deception. Perhaps that was why my first visible response was simply to give a weary sigh without making any attempt to abandon my all-fours posture. My sigh brought Emily into the room, and she laid a hand very gently on my back. I'm not sure if she actually knelt down, but her face seemed close to mine as she said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想我太在意这些细节，才没有早点发现埃米莉站在走廊里，就在门口，看着我。看见她，我的第一反应不是害怕或者尴尬，而是受伤：她居然就那么站在那里，不告诉我说她回来了。想到几分钟前我为了避免现在这种情况还特意打电话给她，我觉得自己被骗了。这大概就是为什么我的第一个动作只是疲惫地叹了口气，仍旧四脚着地跪在地上，没有起来。我看着埃米莉走进屋子，一只手很温柔地搭在我的背上。我不确定她有没有跪下来，但她说话时，脸离我很近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I got down on all fours, and lowering my head towards the same magazine, sank my teeth into the pages. The taste was perfumy, and not at all unpleasant. I opened a second fallen magazine near its centre and began to repeat the procedure. The ideal technique, I began to gather, was not unlike the one needed in those fairground games where you try to bite apples bobbing in water without using your hands. What worked best was a light, chewing motion, the jaws moving flexibly all the time: this would cause the pages to ruffle up and crease nicely. Too focused a bite, on the other hand, simply "stapled" pages together to no great effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次我四脚着地，低下头，把牙齿伸进同一本杂志。味道香香的，不是很糟。我翻开另一本掉在地上的杂志，翻到中间，重复同样的动作。我渐渐领悟到，最理想的动作跟在露天市场里玩不用手咬起浮在水里的苹果的游戏类似。轻轻地咀嚼、下巴不停地轻盈摆动，效果最好：这样书页就会变得乱糟糟、皱巴巴的。相反，咬得太用力只会把书页都“钉”在一起，没有明显效果。">查看中文翻译</div>
