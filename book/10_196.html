<div class="line_en">Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up ("but with never a thank-you" he thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling surprised him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!" he said to himself, "thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age!" So he put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the dining-room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village. They were on ponies, and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，其他人也都从村庄大路的拐角冒了出来。他们一个个都骑着小马，每个小马背上还驮着各式各样的行李、包裹和各种随身用具。其中还有一匹非常矮的小马，显然是给比尔博留的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before May, on laden ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark-green hood (a little weather-stained) and a dark-green cloak borrowed from Dwalin. They were too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would have thought of him, I daren't think. His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，在五月即将到来前的一个晴朗的早晨，他们慢慢骑着装满行李的小马，一齐踏上了旅程。比尔博戴着从杜瓦林那里借来的一顶深绿色的兜帽（有些破旧）和深绿色斗篷。这两样东西对他来说都太大了些，让他显得相当滑稽。他老爸邦果见了他这副模样会作何感想，可是让人连想都不敢想。惟一让他感到舒服的地方是，至少人们不会把他误认成矮人，因为他没有留胡子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first they had passed through hobbit-lands, a wide respectable country inhabited by decent folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business. Then they came to lands where people spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before. Now they had gone on far into the Lone-lands, where there were no people left, no inns, and the roads grew steadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of them were old castles with an evil look, as if they had been built by wicked people. Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can be, can be, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone-lands they had been obliged to camp when they could, but at least it had been dry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始他们经过的是霍比特人的土地，这是一片开阔的、值得受人尊敬的乡野，居民都是些正直而又体面的人，道路平整，点缀着一两间客栈，间或会遇到一位从容赶路的矮人或是农夫。接着，一行人来到了说陌生语言的区域，人们唱的歌谣也是比尔博之前从未听到过的。再接着他们就深入到了野地，这里没有住户，没有客栈，道路的情况也越来越糟。前方不远处是阴郁的山丘，因着树木而呈现出黢黑的颜色，山势也变得越来越高起来。有些山丘上有古旧的城堡，它们那邪恶的外表让人觉得仿佛是由邪恶的人们所建造的。那天的天气突然变得很是糟糕，让一切看上去都显得十分阴郁。大多数时候，这里的天气都像明媚的五月该有的那样，美好得简直像老旧的快乐传说，但现在却是又湿又冷的。在野地行路时，他们虽然有时必须要露营，但至少天气是干燥的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had not been riding very long, when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. He had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo's pipe and tobacco. So after that the party went along very merrily, and they told stories or sang songs as they rode forward all day, except of course when they stopped for meals. These didn't come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们骑了没多久，就碰上了甘道夫威风凛凛地骑着大白马而来。他带来了很多的手帕，还有比尔博的烟斗和烟草。因此在那之后，这一伙人赶起路来就都心情畅快了，一路上都在说着故事，唱着歌，只有停下来用餐的时候才会稍稍中断一下。虽然停下来用餐的次数不像比尔博希望的那么频繁，但他还是开始慢慢觉得，冒险其实并不是那么糟糕的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the hobbit. Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down, for it began to get dark as they went down into a deep valley with a river at the bottom. Wind got up, and willows along its banks bent and sighed. Fortunately the road went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river, swollen with the rains, came rushing down from the hills and mountains in the north.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="矮人们依旧慢慢地朝前走着，没有谁回过头来注意一下霍比特人。在满天乌云的背后，太阳肯定已经落下去了，因为天色开始变得昏暗。他们此时正在走向一个深深的山谷，有一条小河在谷底流淌。风势紧了起来，河堤上的柳树弯下了腰，在风中发出叹息。绵绵淫雨令小河的水涨了起来，从北方的大山和丘陵间奔流而下，幸亏路上有一座古老的石桥，不然他们还真不知道该怎么过河呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"To think it will soon be June!" grumbled Bilbo, as he splashed along behind the others in a very muddy track. It was after tea-time; it was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. "And I'm sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food-bags," thought Bilbo. "Bother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!" It was not the last time that he wished that!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这鬼天气，就像快到六月了一样。”比尔博一边跟在其他人身后在一条满是泥浆的道路上啪嗒啪嗒地走着，一边嘴里嘟囔道。这会儿已经过了下午茶的时间，天上下着滂沱大雨，而且从早上一直下到现在。雨水从兜帽上滴进他的眼睛里，斗篷也湿透了。小马非常疲倦，在石头路上蹒跚而行，其他人也都垂头耷脑地懒得说话。“我敢肯定，这雨水一定已经渗进了干衣服里面，还流进了我们装食物的袋子。”比尔博在心中思忖，“我干吗要跟人家来趟飞贼什么的浑水！真希望我这会儿是在自己美妙的洞府家中，坐在壁炉旁边，听着水壶咕嘟咕嘟开始滚的声音！”这可不是他最后一次许下这种愿望！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was nearly night when they had crossed over. The wind broke up the grey clouds, and a wandering moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags. Then they stopped, and Thorin muttered something about supper, "and where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?" Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while. He had eaten most, talked most, and laughed most. But now he simply was not there at all!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过完小河后，天已经快黑透了。风势强劲，把山冈上空的乌云吹得如破布般飞散，露出一轮仿似在闲庭信步的月亮。这时大伙儿停了下来，索林嘟噜嘟噜地说了几句有关晚餐的事情，“而且哪里能找到干的地方睡觉呢？” 这时，他们才发现甘道夫失踪了。虽说他已经和他们走了这一路，可他其实根本没提过他是要和他们一起冒险呢，还是只是暂时和他们搭伴行路。他吃得最多，说得最多，笑得也最多，可现在却连影子都不见了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They decided in the end that they would have to camp where they were. They moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip, was most annoying. Also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even Oin and Gloin, who were specially good at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终大家决定就地宿营。他们来到一丛树木之间，虽说树下面稍微要干一点，但风会把雨从叶子上刮落，滴滴答答的很是恼人。连火似乎也和他们捣起蛋来，若在平时，矮人们不管有风没风，几乎能用任何东西生出一堆火来，可这天晚上却怎么也不行，即便是最擅长生火的欧因和格罗因也束手无策。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There they all sat glum and wet and muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to light the fire, and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony-rides in May-sunshine, when Balin, who was always their look-out man, said: "There's a light over there!" There was a hill some way off with trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they could now see a light shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as it might be a fire or torches twinkling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家一身透湿，无比郁闷地坐在地上，口中骂骂咧咧。欧因和格罗因还在试着生火，一边还相互斗着嘴。比尔博在伤心懊悔，冒险并不如他想像那样，尽是在五月阳光下骑着小马的快乐旅程。这时，总是担任警戒与瞭望的巴林突然大喊起来：“那边有光！”不远处有座长着树木的小山丘，有些地方树木长得相当浓密，从树木构成的大片黑暗之中，他们可以清楚地看见有一点光芒在闪耀，那是一点红色的、温暖的光芒，似乎是一团营火，又像是几支火把在摇曳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. He got into the river before they could catch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili and Kili were nearly drowned, and all the baggage that he carried was washed away off him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty little left for supper, and less for breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，有匹小马突然无缘无故地受了惊吓，冲了出去。大家还没来得及拦住，它就冲进了河里。大伙儿好不容易把它拽出水面，菲力和奇力还差点淹死，小马背上驮着的行李全都被水冲走了。真是怕什么来什么，那匹小马驮的主要是食物，这下子，晚餐就吃不到什么东西了，第二天的早餐就更别提了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had looked at it for some while, they fell to arguing. Some said "no" and some said "yes". Some said they could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">That settled it. "After all we have got a burglar with us," they said; and so they made off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper caution) in the direction of the light. They came to the hill and were soon in the wood. Up the hill they went; but there was no proper path to be seen, such as might lead to a house or a farm; and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and crackling and creaking (and a good deal of grumbling and dratting), as they went through the trees in the pitch dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们这一打倒让大家停止了争论。“别忘了我们身边还有一个飞贼！”大家说道，于是他们匆匆开拔，牵着小马，尽可能小心谨慎地往亮光的方向走去。他们来到山脚下，不久就走进了丛林中。他们朝山丘上走去，但却看不到一条像样的道路，就是有可能会通向一所房子或一处农庄的那种。他们在一片漆黑的树林中勉力前行，一路上弄出不少窸窸窣窣、噼里啪啦、嘎吱嘎吱的声响，当然也少不了咕咕哝哝和骂骂咧咧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Others said: "These parts are none too well known, and are too near the mountains. Travellers seldom come this way now.

<div class="line_en">"Now it is the burglar's turn," they said, meaning Bilbo. "You must go on and find out all about that light, and what it is for, and if all is perfectly safe and canny," said Thorin to the hobbit. "Now scuttle off, and come back quick, if all is well.

As for Bilbo walking primly towards the red light, I don't suppose even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it.

<div class="line_en">Three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs. They were toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their fingers. There was a fine toothsome smell. Also there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously trolls. Even Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could see that: from the great heavy faces of them, and their size, and the shape of their legs, not to mention their language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done. He was very much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished himself a hundred miles away, and yet-and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and Company emptyhanded. So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls' pockets seemed the least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些比尔博都知道。有许多事情，他虽然没有亲眼见过，亲自做过，但都从书里读到过。眼前的景象既令他感到惊恐，又令他感到恶心。他真希望自己此时此刻是在几百哩之外，但是——不管怎样他不能就这样空着手就回去见索林和伙伴们。他直起身子，在暗影中踌躇了片刻。在他听过的形形色色的飞贼故事中，从食人妖的口袋里偷东西似乎是最不费力的，于是他静悄悄地潜到威廉身后的大树后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. After hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done something at once. Either he should have gone back quietly and warned his friends that there were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try roasted dwarf, or even pony, for a change; or else he should have done a bit of good quick burgling. A really first-class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls' pockets-it is nearly always worth while, if you can manage it --, pinched the very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer, and walked off without their noticing him. Others more practical but with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it. Then the night could have been spent cheerily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，食人妖一般来说都是这副德性，即使那些只有一颗头的家伙也是如此。比尔博在听完这一切之后，本该立刻有所举动的。他要么悄悄地跑回去警告朋友，说那里有三只高大的食人妖，心情相当不好，可能会想要烤矮人甚至小马来换换口味；要么他可以身手敏捷地干些飞贼的勾当。一个真正一流的、能成为传奇的飞贼，会在这个时候从食人妖身边顺走点东西——只要能办得到，这样做几乎总是颇有价值的——比如把羊腿从烤肉叉上摘下来，偷走他们的啤酒，再神不知鬼不觉地溜走。如果更实际一点，不那么讲究飞贼的职业声誉的话，还可以在它们察觉之前，把三个食人妖一人一刀给结果了，这样大家就可以开开心心地度过这一晚了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!" said a voice that sounded like William's. But it wasn't. For just at that moment the light came over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in the branches. William never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them; for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are made of, and never move again. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“曙光会照到你们所有人，将你们化作岩石！”一个有点像威廉的声音说道。但那不是威廉的声音，因为就在那一刻，晨光越过山丘，树梢间传来大声的叽叽喳喳的鸟鸣。威廉再也没有机会开口说话，因为他就站在那里变成了石头，保持着被晨光照到时的姿势。而汤姆和伯特则变成石头定在那里，眼睛还在看着威廉。直到今日，这三个食人妖还是孤孤单单地矗立在那边，只有鸟儿偶尔在它们头上停留。因为你们或许知道，对于食人妖来说，必须在天亮前遁入地下，否则它们就会变回成制造它们所用的原料岩石。这就是伯特、汤姆和威廉的下场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. They were nearly suffocated, and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and mincing them. They had to hear Bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice over, before they were satisfied.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Excellent!" said Gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo to climb down out of a thorn-bush. Then Bilbo understood. It was the wizard's voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了！”甘道夫从树后面走了出来，又帮着比尔博从一株长满荆刺的灌木上爬了下来。这时，比尔博才明白，原来是巫师用自己的声音让食人妖们彼此吵闹不休，直到天光降临，给了它们一个了断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking," said Bombur, "when what we wanted was fire and food!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就算换了这两样东西，他们也不会太太平平地奉上。”甘道夫说，“你们现在可是在浪费时间了。食人妖总想着要躲避阳光，所以在它们出没之处的附近一定会有洞穴或是挖出来的地洞，你们难道没想到吗？我们一定得仔细找找！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls' stony boots going away through the trees.

<div class="line_en">"Why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried. Gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the keyhole. Then the stone door swung back with one big push, and they all went inside. There were bones on the floor and a nasty smell was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner. There were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls-too small for trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims-and among them were several swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你干吗不早说？”大家齐声喊道。甘道夫抓过钥匙，插进钥匙孔中，再用力一推，石门便向后打开了，大家一起进了石洞。石洞的地上有很多的白骨，空气中飘着一股难闻的味道。不过架子上、地上倒是胡乱堆放着许多食物。石洞中到处散乱着掠夺来的财物，从黄铜扣子到堆在一个角落里的装满金币的坛子，形形色色，应有尽有。墙壁上还挂着很多衣服——对食人妖来说明显太小，多半是从那些被害人身上扒下来的——在这些衣物之间，还有各种款式、形状和尺寸的剑，其中两把特别吸引他们的目光，因为它们拥有美丽的剑鞘和镶嵌着宝石的剑柄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Would this be any good?" asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired and angry. "I found it on the ground where the trolls had their fight." He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had thought it very small and secret. It must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was turned to stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道这个有没有用？”比尔博提出这个问题的时候，矮人们已经又累又气了，“我是在食人妖打架那里的地上找到这东西的。”说着他拿出一把大钥匙，尽管威廉一定觉得这是一把很小、很不容易发现的钥匙。很幸运的是，这把钥匙在他变成石头之前从他口袋中掉了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these; and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫和索林各自拿了一把，比尔博则拿了一把带鞘的刀子。这对食人妖来说大概只能算是装在口袋里的小刀，但对霍比特人来说却已经可以算得上是短剑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"These look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them and looking at them curiously. "They were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts and days; but when we can read the runes on them, we shall know more about them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“像是好剑哪。”巫师将剑从鞘中拔出一半，好奇地打量着，“这不是食人妖自己做的，也不是这一带的人类工匠现在能够制作出的。等我们把上面的如尼文解读出来，应该可以知道更多它们的来历。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's get out of this horrible smell!" said Fili. So they carried out the pots of coins, and such food as was untouched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of ale which was still full. By that time they felt like breakfast, and being very hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they had got from the trolls' larder. Their own provisions were very scanty. Now they had bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快走吧，我可不想再闻这股臭味儿了！”菲力说。于是大家把一坛坛金币搬了出去，接着是那些没被食人妖碰过，看着还能吃的食物，还有一桶依然是满满的麦芽酒。这时他们才觉得该吃早餐了，由于每个人都已经饿得前胸贴了后背，所以大家抓过从食人妖洞里得来的食物就狼吞虎咽地吃了起来，连头都不曾抬过一下。他们自己原先准备下的粮食已经所剩无几了，现在一下子又有了面包和奶酪、一大桶麦芽酒，还有可以放在营火的余烬里烤的火腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that they slept, for their night had been disturbed; and they did nothing more till the afternoon. Then they brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, just in case they ever had the chance to come back and recover them. When that was done, they all mounted once more, and jogged along again on the path towards the East.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完以后大伙儿便睡下了，因为刚刚过去的一晚上一直都在折腾。这一觉一睡就睡到了下午。醒过来之后，他们牵过小马，装上一坛坛金币，将它们运到离小道不远的河边，非常隐密地埋了起来，还对这批财宝施了很多的魔法，为的是万一将来他们还有命回来时，能重新找到这些财宝。忙活完之后，他们又全都再次上马，继续沿着山路向东方慢慢行去。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was they who told me that three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the road: they had frightened everyone away from the district, and they waylaid strangers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别插嘴！”甘道夫说，“如果我们运气好的话，再走几天就能到那儿了，到了你就自然会知道那是什么地方。我刚才说到，我碰到了两个埃尔隆德的人，他们因为害怕食人妖，所以正在匆忙赶路。就是他们告诉我说，有三个食人妖从山上跑了下来，在离大路不远的森林里面住了下来，它们不仅把这附近的人都给吓跑了，还攻击过路的旅人。">查看中文翻译</div>
