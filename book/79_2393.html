<div class="line_en">Jack came out onto the porch, tugging the tab of his zipper up under his chin, blinking into the bright air. In his left hand he was holding a battery-powered hedge-clipper. He tugged a fresh handkerchief out of his back pocket with his right hand, wiped his lips with it, and tucked it away. Snow, they had said on the radio. It was hard to believe, even though he could see the clouds building up on the far horizon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克走出大门，站在前廊上，把拉链一直拉到下巴，望了一眼明亮的天空。他左手提一部电瓶驱动的树篱修剪机，右手抽出一条新手帕揩了揩嘴唇，然后又把手帕塞了回去。大雪即将来临，收音机已经预报过了。尽管远方地平线上正在堆起云团，他还是有些不太相信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He started down the path to the topiary, switching the hedge-clipper over to the other hand. It wouldn't be a long job, he thought; a little touch-up would do it. The cold nights had surely stunted their growth. The rabbit's ears looked a little fuzzy, and two of the dog's legs had grown fuzzy green bonespurs, but the lions and the buffalo looked fine. Just a little haircut would do the trick, and then let the snow come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他沿小径向树篱动物走去，边走边把修剪机换到另一只手里。干这活花不了多少时间，他想，稍稍修剪一下就行了。寒冷的夜晚减慢了树篱生长的速度。兔子的耳朵有点发毛，两条狗的腿上也长上了毛绒绒的绿色骨突，但狮子和水牛的模样都还不错，给它们理理毛发就行了，然后就等着下雪吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The concrete path ended as abruptly as a diving board. He stepped off it and walked past the drained pool to the gravel path which wound through the hedge sculptures and into the playground itself. He walked over to the rabbit and pushed the button on the handle of the clippers. It hummed into quiet life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他来到水泥路尽头，经过了排干的水池，踏上了一条蜿蜒穿过树篱动物通往游乐场的鹅卵石小路。他来到兔子旁边，打开修剪机柄上的按钮。机器的嗡嗡声打破了四周的宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ah, that was true. So true. He clipped along the rabbit's ears, brushing a small litter of sticks and twigs off onto the grass. The hedge-clipper hummed in that low and rather disgustingly metallic way that all battery-powered appliances seem to have. The sun was brilliant but it held no warmth, and now it wasn't so hard to believe that snow was coming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，没错儿，一点不假。他从兔子的耳朵开始修剪起来，把剪下的枝叶扫到草坪上。修剪机发出了所有电动机所共有的那种低沉而且令人讨厌的嗡嗡声。阳光耀眼，但没有什么热力，此时，大雪即将来临不那么令人难以相信了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hi, Br'er Rabbit," Jack said. "How are you today? A little off the top and get some of the extra off your ears? Fine. Say, did you hear the one about the traveling salesman and the old lady with a pet poodle?" His voice sounded unnatural and stupid in his ears, and he stopped. It occurred to him that he didn't care much for these hedge animals. It had always seemed slightly perverted to him to clip and torture a plain old hedge into something that it wasn't. Along one of the highways in Vermont there had been a hedge billboard on a high slope overlooking the road, advertising some kind of ice cream. Making nature peddle ice cream, that was just wrong. It was grotesque.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，兔老弟，”杰克说。“今天感觉怎么样？理理发，修修耳朵，好吗？棒极了。告诉我，听过推销员和有条长卷毛狗的老妇人的故事吗？”他觉得自己的声音很不自然，傻里傻气的，于是就没有再讲下去。他想：这些树篱动物并不那么讨他喜欢，他一直反对把朴实无华的树篱修剪成这个样子。弗蒙特州一条公路侧边的山坡上有一张树篱台球桌，上面打着冰淇淋广告。让自然界兜售冰淇淋简直是大错特错、荒谬绝伦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But if it was my hotel," he said, "I'd cut the whole damn bunch of you down." He would, too. Just cut them down and resod the lawn where they'd been and put in half a dozen small metal tables with gaily colored umbrellas. People could have cocktails on the Overlook's lawn in the summer sun. Sloe gin fizzes and margaritas and pink ladies and all those sweet tourist drinks. A rum and tonic, maybe. Jack took his handkerchief out of his back pocket and slowly rubbed his lips with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“假如饭店是我的，”他说。“我会统统把你们砍掉。”他会这样做的。砍掉树丛，铺上草皮，摆几张金属小桌，撑几把色彩明快的遮阳伞。人们可以在夏日的阳光里在饭店的草坪上享用鸡尾酒。黑刺李酒、玛格利塔酒、粉红的女士酒，以及种类齐全的假日甜饮料。也许他会来一杯朗姆滋补酒。杰克掏出手帕，不紧不慢地擦着嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Working quickly, knowing that to stop and think when you were at this kind of a task usually meant making a mistake, Jack touched up the rabbit's "face" (up this close it didn't look like a face at all, but he knew that at a distance of twenty paces or so light and shadow would seem to suggest one; that, and the viewer's imagination) and then zipped the clippers along its belly.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was going to start back, and then some impulse made him change his mind and he went down to the playground instead. It was funny how you never knew kids, he thought. He and Wendy had expected Danny would love the playground; it had everything a kid could want. But Jack didn't think the boy had been down half a dozen times, if that. He supposed if there had been another kid to play with, it would have been different.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正要往回走，这时，某种冲动使他改变了主意，他向游乐场走去。真有趣，你永远也猜不透孩子们的心思，他想。他和温迪都以为丹尼会喜欢这个游乐场，孩子们爱玩的东西那里面应有尽有。可丹尼最多来过五六次，要是真来过的话。他想，要是还有个孩子一起玩，情况可能会有所不同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on, come on," he said softly. That was nothing to be thinking about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“得了，得了，”他小声说。这不是该他操心的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gate squeaked slightly as he let himself in, and then there was crushed gravel crunching under his feet. He went first to the playhouse, the perfect scale model of the Overlook itself. It came up to his lower thigh, just about Danny's height when he was standing up. Jack hunkered down and looked in the third-floor windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大门轻微地吱哑了一声，他进去了，然后他脚下响起了鹅卵石相互挤压的嘎嘎声。他首先来到游戏房边，这是远望饭店的一个按比例缩小的模型，正好跟丹尼差不多一样高。杰克蹲下去往四楼窗户里瞅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The giant has come to eat you all up in your beds," he said hollowly. "Kiss your Triple A rating goodbye." But that wasn't funny, either. You could open the house simply by pulling it apart -- it opened on a hidden hinge. The inside was a disappointment. The walls were painted, but the place was mostly hollow. But of course it would have to be, he told himself, or how else could the kids get inside? What play furniture might go with the place in the summer was gone, probably packed away in the equipment shed. He closed it up and heard the small click as the latch closed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“巨人来了，要趁你们睡觉时把你们统统吃光，”他的声音在空房子里嗡嗡作响。没趣，房子里面更令人失望。墙壁油漆过，但里面几乎什么都没有。不过，里边当然只能是这个样子，他告诉自己，要不然孩子们怎么进得去呢？夏天房子里摆放的玩具现在不见了，可能已经收拾到了工具棚里。他关上玩具房，听到销子插上时的咔嗒声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Goddam scavenger birds," his dad would say, "don't you feed them, Jacky." But they would both end up feeding them, and giggling at the way they ran after the nuts, the greedy way they ran after the nuts. Jack didn't think the old man had ever taken his brothers to the park. Jack had been his favorite, and even so Jack had taken his lumps when the old man was drunk, which was a lot of the time. But Jack had loved him for as long as he was able, long after the rest of the family could only hate and fear him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“该死的捡垃圾吃的臭鸟，”老爸会对他说，“别喂它们，杰克。”但他们最后都会喂这些鸟儿的，常常被它们争相扑食的样子逗乐了。杰克不记得老爸带他几个哥哥去公园玩过。杰克是他最宠爱的儿子，即便如此，杰克在他老爸喝醉酒——那简直是家常便饭——之后也免不了挨揍。但是，在家里其他人对他只剩下仇恨和畏惧之后很久，杰克仍然爱着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked over to the slide, set the hedge-clipper down, and after a glance back at the driveway to make sure Wendy and Danny hadn't returned, he climbed to the top and sat down. This was the big kids' slide, but the fit was still uncomfortably tight for his grownup ass. How long had it been since he had been on a slide? Twenty years? It didn't seem possible it could be that long, it didn't feel that long, but it had to be that, or more. He could remember his old man taking him to the park in Berlin when he had been Danny's age, and he had done the whole bit-slide, swings, teeter-totters, everything. He and the old man would have a hotdog lunch and buy peanuts from the man with the cart afterward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他来到滑梯边，放下修剪机，往后望了一眼机动车道，确信温迪和丹尼还没回来后，他爬上滑梯，坐在上面。这是架大孩子们玩的滑梯，但滑道对他这个成人的屁股来说还是窄得有些不舒服。他告别滑梯多少年了？20年？似乎不可能有那么久，感觉上没有那么久，但肯定有那么久了，也许还不止那么久。他还能回想起他老爸在他只有丹尼那么大的时候带他去珀林公园玩的情景，那时他什么都会玩——滑梯，秋千，跷跷板等等。他和他老爸常常吃一顿热狗当午餐，然后在推车叫卖的小贩那里买些花生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pushed off with his hands and went to the bottom, but the trip was unsatisfying. The slide, unused, had too much friction and no really pleasant speed could be built up. And his ass was just too big. His adult feet thumped into the slight dip where thousands of children's feet had landed before him. He stood up, brushed at the seat of his pants, and looked at the hedge-clipper. But instead of going back to it he went to the swings, which were also a disappointment. The chains had built up rust since the close of the season, and they squealed like things in pain. Jack promised himself he would oil them in the spring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克双手一推，滑到了滑梯底端，但并不舒服。滑梯久已不用，摩擦太大，达不到让人产生快感的速度，况且他屁股也太大了点儿。他的脚踏进了成百上千的孩子踩成的浅坑里，站起来，拍了拍屁股，看了一眼修剪机，但他没去取，却往秋千那边走去了。秋千同样令人沮丧。上个季节结束以来秋千的铁链已经锈迹斑斑了，动一动便吱呀吱呀直呻吟。杰克暗自许诺：来年春天一定给秋千上润滑油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he went on to the cement rings -- they were too small for him and he passed them up -- and then to the security fence which marked the edge of the grounds. He curled his fingers through the links and looked through, the sun crosshatching shadow-lines on his face like a man behind bars. He recognized the similarity himself and he shook the chain link, put a harried expression on his face, and whispered: "Lemme outta here! Lemme outta here!" But for the third time, not funny. It was time to get back to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他还是往水泥筒那边去了——这些管子对他来说太小，没有留下他的脚步——接着又向饭店大院外缘的安全栅走去。他把手指扣在栅栏网眼里向外望去，阳光在他脸上投下了纵横交错的阴影，这使他看上去很像一个身陷囹圄的囚徒。他也意识到这个相似之处，于是推搡着栅栏，做出一副饱经煎熬折磨的表情，低声念叨道：“放我出去！放我出去！”可第三遍就索然无味了。该回去工作了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was like that game they had played when they were kids, red light. One person was "it," and while he turned his back and counted to ten, the other players crept forward. When "it" got to ten, he whirled around and if he caught anyone moving, they were out of the game. The others remained frozen in statue postures until "it" turned his back and counted again. They got closer and closer, and at last, somewhere between five and ten, you would feel a hand on your back…</div>

<div class="line_en">The lion on the left had advanced all the way to the fence now; its muzzle was touching the boards. It seemed to be grinning at him. Jack backed up another two steps. His head was thudding crazily and he could feel the dry rasp of his breath in his throat. Now the buffalo had moved, circling to the right, behind and around the rabbit. The head was lowered, the green hedge horns pointing at him. The thing was, you couldn't watch all of them. Not all at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="左边的狮子已经逼近栅栏，它的嘴触到了木板条上，好像在对着他笑。杰克向后退了两步。他脑子里的血管疯狂地跳动着，他听得见嗓子里干燥的喘息声。这时，水牛也动了起来，它向右边转去，绕到兔子的后面，低着头，绿色的牛角指着他。麻烦在于不能同时看到它们——一眼看不过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He jerked his head around to look at the dog and it was halfway down the pathway, just behind the lions now, its mouth wide and yawning. Before, it had only been a hedge clipped in the general shape of a dog, something that lost all definition when you got up close to it. But now Jack could see that it had been clipped to look like a German shepherd, and shepherds could be mean. You could train shepherds to kill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他扭头去看那条狗。现在，它已经来到小路的半道上，紧跟在狮子后面，宽宽的嘴巴张得大大的。从前，它只是大体上剪得像条狗，近看还看不出是什么东西，但现在，杰克看出它原来被剪成了德国牧羊犬的样子。这是一种十分凶残的狗，你可以训练它们杀人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He began to make a whining sound, unaware in his locked concentration that he was making any sound at all. His eyes darted from one hedge creature to the next, trying to see them move. The wind gusted, making a hungry rattling sound in the close-matted branches. What kind of sound would there be if they got him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发出了呜呜的哀鸣声，在精神高度集中的状态下他根本就没意识到自己在呻吟。他的目光不停地移动着，试图监视所有树篱动物的动向。一阵风吹过来，刮过密密层层的树丛，发出了刷啦啦的响声。如果它们逮住了他，那又将发出什么样的声响？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the putting green the dog was sitting up, as if begging for a scrap. The buffalo was gazing with disinterest back toward the roque court, as it had been when Jack had come down with the clippers. The rabbit stood on its hind legs, ears up to catch the faintest sound, freshly clipped belly exposed. The lions, rooted into place, stood beside the path.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狗坐在高尔夫球轻击区边上，好像要讨一点碎面包；水牛漠然地扭头盯着槌球场；兔子站在后腿上，耳朵警惕地竖立着，仿佛要听到最细小的声音，刚刚修剪过的肚皮露在外面；狮子一动不动地站在小路边。一切都复原了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood frozen for a long time, the harsh breath in his throat finally slowing. He reached for his cigarettes and shook four of them out onto the gravel. He stooped down and picked them up, groped for them, never taking his eyes from the topiary for fear the animals would begin to move again. He picked them up, stuffed three carelessly back into the pack, and lit the fourth. After two deep drags he dropped it and crushed it out. He went to the hedge-clipper and picked it up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一动不动地站了很久，喉咙里的喘息声终于平静下来。他伸手掏烟，手直抖，四支烟掉到了卵石路上。他弯腰去拾，手在地上摸索着，眼睛一刻也不敢离开树篱，生怕它们又动起来。他捡起散落的烟，将三支放回烟盒里，燃上了剩下的一支。他深吸两口，扔掉，踩灭烟头，然后走过去把修剪机提了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But of course he knew. A snapping, rending, breaking sound. It would be -- (no no NO NO I WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS NOT AT ALL!) He clapped his hands over his eyes, clutching at his hair, his forehead, his throbbing temples. And he stood like that for a long time, dread building until he could stand it no longer and he pulled his hands away with a cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，他是知道的。一阵撕扯、折断、拍击声。然后——（不，不——我不相信眼前的这些是真的，绝不！）他拍打自己的眼睛，拽自己的头发，摁自己的前额和狂跳的太阳穴。他这样站了许久，恐惧不断积聚着，直到他再也不能承受为止。他大叫一声，甩开了双手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the Overlook's kitchen he paused to take two Excedrin and then went downstairs and looked at papers until he heard the dim sound of the hotel truck rattling into the driveway. He went up to meet them. He felt all right. He saw no need to mention his hallucination. He'd had a bad scare but it was over now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在厨房里稍事停留，取了两片镇痛药，然后到地下室看旧报纸去了，直到隐约听见卡车哐当哐当开进机动车道为止。他上楼去接他们。他感觉不错，觉得没有必要向他们提起自己产生幻觉的事。他受了惊吓，但现在一切都过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm very tired," he said, and now it seemed okay to talk out loud. It didn't seem crazy at all. "I've been under a strain. The wasps… the play… Al calling me like that. But it's all right."</div>

<div class="line_en">He began to trudge back up to the hotel. Part of his mind tugged fretfully at him, tried to make him detour around the hedge animals, but he went directly up the gravel path, through them. A faint breeze rattled through them, that was all. He had imagined the whole thing. He had had a bad scare but it was over now.</div>
