<div class="line_en">Until the day of the funeral, Marilyn has never thought about the last time she would see her daughter. She would have imagined a touching bedside scene, like in the movies: herself white-haired and elderly and content, in a satin bed jacket, ready to say her good-byes; Lydia a grown woman, confident and poised, holding her mother's hands in hers, a doctor by then, unfazed by the great cycle of life and death. And Lydia, though Marilyn does not admit it, is the face she would want to see last -- not Nath or Hannah or even James, but the daughter she thinks of first and always. Now her last glimpse of Lydia has already passed: James, to her bewilderment, has insisted on a closed-casket funeral. She will not even get to see her daughter's face one last time, and for the past three days, she has told James this over and over, sometimes furious, sometimes through tears. James, for his part, cannot find the words to tell her what he discovered on going to identify Lydia's body: there is only half a face left, barely preserved by the cold water of the lake; the other half had already been eaten away. He ignores his wife and keeps his eyes trained on the rearview mirror as he backs into the street.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cemetery is only a fifteen-minute walk from their house, but they drive anyway. As they turn onto the main road that circles the lake, Marilyn looks sharply to the left, as if she's spotted something on the shoulder of her husband's jacket. She doesn't want to see the pier, the rowboat now re-moored, the lake itself stretching out into the distance. James has the car windows rolled up tight, but the breeze shakes the leaves of the trees on the banks and corrugates the surface of the water. It will be there forever, the lake: every time they leave their house, they will see it. In the backseat, Nath and Hannah wonder in unison if their mother will turn her head away for the rest of her life, every time she passes by. The lake glints in the sun like a shiny tin roof, and Nath's eyes begin to water. It seems inappropriate for the light to be so bright, for the sky to be so blue, and he's relieved when a cloud drifts over the sun and the water turns from silver to gray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从他们的家走到墓地只需要十五分钟，但他们还是开了车。车子拐到环湖的大路上时，玛丽琳突然向左边偏过头，仿佛发现了丈夫的外套上有什么东西似的。她不想看到那个码头，那艘重新泊好的小船，还有那片绵延远去的湖水。虽然詹姆斯紧闭着车窗，但是，通过岸边摇晃的树叶，还有湖面的波纹，仍然能够感受到湖上吹来的微风。它会永远在那里，在那个湖中；他们每次出门，都会看到它。后座上的内斯和汉娜同时在想，每次经过湖边的时候，母亲会不会一辈子都偏着头不去看它。湖面反射着阳光，如同锡制的房顶，晃得内斯的眼睛开始流泪。阳光灿烂得过分，天也蓝得过分，他满意地看到一朵云从太阳面前飘过，湖水立刻从银色变成了灰色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the cemetery, they pull into the parking lot. Middlewood is proud of its garden cemetery, a sort of graveyard and botanical garden in one, with winding paths and small brass signs to identify the flora. Nath remembers middle-school science trips with sketch pads and field guides; once the teacher had promised ten extra-credit points to the person who could gather the most kinds of leaves. There had been a funeral that day, too, and Tommy Reed had tiptoed between rows of folding chairs to the sassafras tree, right in the middle of the eulogy, and plucked a leaf from a low-hanging branch. Mr. Rexford hadn't noticed and had complimented Tommy on being the only one to find Sassafras albidum, and the whole class had stifled giggles and high-fived Tommy on the bus ride home. Now, as they walk single file toward the cluster of chairs set up in the distance, Nath wants to go back in time and punch Tommy Reed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们把车停到墓地的停车场。当地的“花园式”墓地颇令米德伍德人自豪——他们把墓地和植物园融合在一起，修建了蜿蜒的小道，在各种植物前面竖起写有名字和介绍的小黄铜牌。内斯记得，初中上自然课的时候，他们来这里写生和野外考察。老师宣布，收集的叶子种类最多的人，可以额外获得十个学分。那天，这里也有一个葬礼，牧师宣读悼词的时候，汤米·里德蹑手蹑脚地穿过一排排折叠椅，来到仪式现场中央的那棵檫树下，从一条低垂的树枝上摘了一片树叶。雷克斯福德老师没有看到他是怎么摘到这片叶子的，所以，他表扬了汤米，因为他是全班唯一找到檫树叶的人。在回家的巴士上，全班都在偷笑，欢呼汤米的成功。而现在，当他们鱼贯走向远处那排折叠椅的时候，内斯很想回到过去揍汤米·里德一顿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Lydia's honor, the school has closed for the day, and Lydia's classmates come, lots of them. Looking at them, James and Marilyn realize just how long it has been since they've seen these girls: years. For a moment they don't recognize Karen Adler with her hair grown long, or Pam Saunders without her braces. James, thinking of the crossed-out list of names, finds himself staring and turns away. Slowly the chairs fill with some of Nath's classmates, with juniors and freshmen he finds vaguely familiar but doesn't really know. Even the neighbors, as they file in, feel like strangers. His parents never go out or entertain; they have no dinner parties, no bridge group, no hunting buddies or luncheon pals. Like Lydia, no real friends. Hannah and Nath recognize a few professors from the university, their father's teaching assistant, but most of the faces in the chairs are strangers. Why are they even here, Nath wonders, and when the service starts and they all crane their necks toward the coffin at the front, under the sassafras tree, he understands. They are drawn by the spectacle of sudden death. For the past week, ever since the police dragged the lake, the headlines in the Middlewood Monitor have all been about Lydia. Oriental Girl Found Drowned in Pond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了悼念莉迪亚，当天学校停课一天，莉迪亚的很多同学都来了。见此情景，詹姆斯和玛丽琳意识到，他们已经有好几年没有看到这些女孩了。卡伦·阿德勒的头发长长了，帕姆·桑德斯摘掉了牙套，詹姆斯和玛丽琳差点没有认出她们来。想起那张名单上被自己划掉的名字，詹姆斯发现他正目不转睛地盯着她们看，赶紧转到一边。折叠椅上逐渐坐满了内斯的同学，有高三的，还有高一的，有些人他觉得很面熟，但并不真正认识。连鱼贯而入的邻居们都像是陌生人。他的父母从不出门交际，也不在家请客，没办过晚餐派对，没有桥牌牌友、猎友或者午餐会上认识的哥们。和莉迪亚一样，他们没有真正的朋友。汉娜和内斯看到，大学里的几个教授也来了，他们是詹姆斯的助教，但折叠椅上坐着的大都是些陌生的面孔。他们为什么会来？内斯想。等到仪式开始，他们都伸长了脖子，望向檫树下摆放的棺材时，他得出了答案：他们是被突如其来的死亡吸引而来的。过去的一个星期，自从警察抽干了湖水，米德伍德《观察报》的头条就一直是关于莉迪亚的。《东方女孩溺死在“池塘”里》。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The minister looks like President Ford, flat-browed, white-toothed, clean-cut, and solid. The Lees do not attend church, but the funeral home had recommended him, and James had accepted without asking any questions. Now James sits up straight, pressing the chair's back into his shoulder blades, and tries to listen to the service. The minister reads the Twenty-third Psalm, but in the revised text: I have everything I need instead of I shall not want; Even if I walk through a very dark valley instead of Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. It feels disrespectful, a corner cut. Like burying his daughter in a plywood box. What else could you expect from this town, he thinks. On his right, the scent of the lilies on the casket hits Marilyn like a warm, wet fog, and she nearly retches. For the first time, she wishes she were the sort of woman, like her mother, who carried a handkerchief. She would have pressed it to her face and let it filter the air, and when she lowered it the cloth would be dirty pink, the color of old bricks. Beside her, Hannah knits her fingers. She would like to worm her hand onto her mother's lap, but she doesn't dare. Nor does she dare look at the coffin. Lydia is not inside, she reminds herself, taking a deep breath, only her body -- but then where is Lydia herself? Everyone is so still that to the birds floating overhead, she thinks, they must look like a cluster of statues.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牧师长得像福特总统，眉毛平直，牙齿洁白，轮廓鲜明，结实可靠。李家人平时不上教堂做礼拜，但殡仪馆仍然推荐了牧师主持葬礼，詹姆斯没有多问就同意了。现在，他正襟危坐，肩胛骨靠着椅背，想要聚精会神地听悼词。牧师诵读了《圣经·诗篇》第二十三章，但经过了改编，并不是原句：“我必不至缺乏”改成了“我拥有一切所需”；“我虽然行过死荫的幽谷”变成“纵然我走过黑暗的幽谷”。听着像偷工减料，缺少尊重，使用这种悼词，好比用胶合板的棺材埋葬他的女儿。不过，他转念一想：“在这样一个小地方，你还能期待什么呢？”玛丽琳坐在詹姆斯右边，棺材上的百合花的味道飘来，像一团温暖湿润的雾气钻进她的鼻孔，让她差点呕吐。平生第一次，她庆幸自己继承了母亲的习惯——随身携带手绢，这样她就能用手绢捂住鼻子，当作过滤器，等取下来的时候，它肯定会变成脏兮兮的粉红色，如同老旧的红砖。汉娜坐在旁边玩手指，她很想把手偷偷放到母亲的膝盖上，但是不敢。她也不敢看棺材，只好提醒自己，莉迪亚不在里面，做个深呼吸，在里面的只是她的身体——可是，既然这样，莉迪亚到底去了哪里？每个人都很安静，她想，天上盘旋的鸟儿肯定把他们当成了一群雕塑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Something wet touches his neck. He reaches up to wipe it away and discovers that his whole face is wet, that he's been crying silently. On the other side of the crowd, Jack's blue eyes are suddenly fixed on him, and Nath blots his cheek in the crook of his arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Out of the corner of his eye, Nath spots Jack sitting at the edge of the crowd beside his mother. He imagines grabbing Jack by the shirt collar to find out what he knows. For the past week, his father has called the police every morning asking for new information, but Officer Fiske says only, over and over, that they are still investigating. If only the police were here now, Nath thinks. Should he tell his father? Jack stares at the ground in front of him, as if he is too ashamed to look up. And then, when Nath himself glances back to the front, the coffin has already been lowered into the ground. The polished wood, the white lilies fastened to its top -- vanished, just like that: nothing but the blank space where it had once stood. He's missed it all. His sister is gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯眼角的余光瞥见杰克坐在人群边缘，靠着他的母亲。他很想揪住杰克的衣领，问问他到底知道些什么。过去的一周，他父亲每天晚上都会给警察打电话，询问是否有新进展，但菲斯克警官的回答一概是“我们还在调查”。如果现在警察在场，内斯想，他是否应该把杰克的事情告诉父亲？杰克盯着脚前的地面，似乎过于愧疚，不敢抬起头来。等内斯回过头向前看的时候，棺材已经被放到墓穴里了。那抛过光的木头，还有棺盖上的白百合——全部消失了，它曾经停放过的地方空无一物。他错过了一切。他的妹妹已经不在了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mourners begin to leave, a thin line of backs filing toward the parking area and the street. A few of Nath's classmates, like Miles Fuller, give him a sympathetic glance, but most -- embarrassed by his tears -- decide not to speak to him, and turn away. They won't have another chance; in light of Nath's high grades and the tragic situation, the principal will exempt him from the last three weeks of school, and Nath himself will decide not to attend commencement. Some of the neighbors circle the Lees, squeezing their arms and murmuring condolences; a few of them pat Hannah on the head, as if she's a tiny child, or a dog. Except for Janet Wolff, her usual white doctor's coat replaced by a trim black suit, James and Marilyn don't recognize most of them. By the time Janet reaches her, Marilyn's palms feel grimy, her whole body dirty, like a rag passed from hand to soiled hand, and she can barely stand Janet's touch on her elbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="悼念的人群开始散去，他们的背影排成一列，向停车场和大街移动。内斯的几个同学——比如迈尔斯·富勒，向他投去同情的目光，但大部分人因为内斯的眼泪让他们觉得尴尬，决定还是不过去和他搭话，纷纷转身离去。他们也再没有其他机会和内斯说话。鉴于内斯优异的成绩以及不幸的现状，校长批准他休假三个星期，内斯本人也不打算参加毕业典礼。一些邻居围住了李家人，抱紧他们的胳膊，说着安慰的话。其中几个拍拍汉娜的头，似乎她是个小婴儿或者小狗。但珍妮特·伍尔夫没有马上走过去，她今天换下了平时的医生白大褂，穿着整洁的黑色套装。其实今天来的大多数邻居，詹姆斯和玛丽琳都没有认出来。所以当珍妮特过去的时候，玛丽琳觉得对方的手掌沾满灰尘，衣服上全是污垢，就像被脏手拿过的抹布，即便只是被珍妮特碰了碰手肘，她也无法忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other side of the grave, Jack stands off to the side, waiting for his mother, half-hidden in the shadow of a big elm.

<div class="line_en">Nath sinks down on the roots of the elm and watches his parents head back toward the car, Hannah trailing after them with one wistful backward glance. His father doesn't know what Jack is like. Jack has lived down the street from them for eleven years, since he and Nath were in the first grade, and to Nath's parents he is just a neighbor boy, the scruffy one with the dog and that old secondhand car. In school, though, everyone knows. Every few weeks a different girl. Every girl the same story. Jack doesn't date; there are no dinners out, no flowers, no boxes of chocolates in cellophane wrap. He simply drives the girl out to the Point or the drive-in or a parking lot somewhere and spreads a blanket across the backseat of his car. A week or two later, he stops calling and moves on. He's known to make a specialty of deflowering virgins. At school, the girls are proud of it, like they've joined an exclusive club; clustered at their lockers, they whisper a giggling, salacious play-by-play. Jack himself talks to no one. It's common knowledge that he's alone most of the time: his mother works night shifts at the hospital, six nights a week. He does not eat in the school cafeteria; he does not go to the dances. In class, he sits in the back row, picking the next girl he'll ask for a ride. This spring he had picked Lydia.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nath huddles in the cemetery an hour, two hours, three, watching the cemetery workers stack the folding chairs, gather the flowers, pluck balled-up papers and tissues from the grass. In his mind, he dredges up every single thing he's ever heard about Jack, every fact, every rumor. The two begin to blur, and by the time he is ready to head home, he is bubbling with a terrible fury. He tries to imagine Lydia with Jack, tries desperately not to picture them together. Had Jack hurt her somehow? He doesn't know. He knows only that Jack is at the heart of everything, and he promises himself he will find out how. Only when the gravediggers lift their shovels and approach the open grave does Nath clamber to his feet and turn away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯在墓园里待了一个小时、两个小时、三个小时，看着工人把折叠椅摞在一起，收好各种花束，清理草丛中的纸团和纸巾。他在心里不停地回想自己掌握的杰克的所有情况——每个事实和每段传言，最后连两者之间的界限都开始变得模糊不清。等到准备回家的时候，一股恐怖的狂怒已然在他的体内沸腾。他既希望又不敢去想象莉迪亚和杰克在一起的情景。杰克是否伤害了她？内斯不知道，他只知道杰克是一切问题的症结，他发誓要弄清真相。直到几个掘墓人扛起铲子，走向没有填土的墓坑，他才艰难地挪动双脚，转身离开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he skirts the edge of the lake and turns onto their street, he spots a police car parked outside Jack's house. About goddamn time, Nath thinks. He sidles closer to the house, slouching below the line of windows. Behind the screen, the front door stands open, and he climbs the porch stairs on his toes, sticking to the edges of the worn boards, making sure they don't squeak. It's his sister they're talking about, he tells himself with each step; he has every right. At the top, he leans toward the screen door. He can't see anything except the entryway, but he can hear Jack in the living room, explaining slowly, loudly, as if it's the second or third time.</div>

During the car ride, Marilyn doesn't look at James once, focusing instead on her knuckles, picking at her cuticles, fiddling with the strap of her handbag. As soon as they come inside, Marilyn says she wants to lie down, and Hannah too vanishes into her room without a word. For a moment James considers joining Marilyn in their bedroom. He's filled with a deep longing to burrow against her, to feel her weight and warmth surrounding him, shielding him from everything else. To cling to her and feel her cling to him and let their bodies comfort each other. But something scratches and scratches at the edge of James's mind, and at last he lifts his keys from the table again. There is something he must do at the office, urgently.

It tells him things he hadn't known: the circumference of her head, the length of each limb, that a small crescent moon scarred her left knee.

That in her stomach were snippets of lake-bottom weeds, sand, and six ounces of lake water she'd swallowed as she sank. That the right side of her heart had swollen, as if it had had too much to hold. That from floating head down in the water, the skin of her head and neck had reddened to her shoulders.

Afterward he falls asleep with Louisa still atop him. Since Lydia was found -- the only word he can bear to use for it -- the little sleep he's had has been restless.

She keeps losing track, moving from eighty-nine back down to eighty, crossing a fold in the fabric and forgetting which are accounted for, which have yet to be numbered. By the time she reaches two hundred, she knows that sleep is impossible. She can't keep her eyes closed; even blinking makes her jittery. Whenever she tries to lie still, her mind whirrs to life like an overwound toy. Upstairs, there is no sound from Hannah; downstairs, no sign of Nath. At last, just as James sinks into sleep across town, she rises and goes where her thoughts have been all this time: Lydia's room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他家的卧室里，玛丽琳也企图放空大脑，却没有成功。她辗转反侧了几个小时，不停地数枕套上的花——不是中间那些大朵的红罂粟，而是边上的蓝色勿忘我，它们就像女歌手身后的伴舞。她总是忘记数到哪里，只好从八十九回到八十，而且，接缝那里的花还没有数过。等她数到两百才意识到，根本不可能睡着。她没法一直闭着眼，连眨眼都让她心神不宁。一想要静静地躺着，她的脑袋就变成了疯转的陀螺。楼上的汉娜没有动静，楼下也没有内斯的踪影。最后，当詹姆斯在镇子另一头睡着的时候，玛丽琳爬起来，来到她一直牵肠挂肚的地方：莉迪亚的房间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this room a deep ache suffuses her, as if her bones are bruised. Yet it feels good, too. Everything here reminds her of what Lydia could have been. Prints of Leonardo's Vitruvian Man, of Marie Curie holding up a vial -- every poster she'd given to Lydia since she was a child -- still hung proudly on the wall. Since childhood, Lydia had wanted to be a doctor, just as her mother once had. Last summer she had even taken a biology course at the college so that she could skip ahead into physics. On the bulletin board hang blue ribbons from years of science fairs, an illustrated periodic table, a real stethoscope that Marilyn had special-ordered for her thirteenth birthday. The bookshelf is so full of books that some are crammed in sideways at the top: A Brief History of Medicine, she reads upside down. Rosalind Franklin and DNA. All the books Marilyn had given her over the years to inspire her, to show her what she could accomplish. Everywhere, evidence of her daughter's talent and ambition. A fine layer of dust has already begun to coat everything. For a long time, Lydia had shooed her out when she came to vacuum and dust and tidy. "I'm busy, Mom," she had said, tapping the tip of her pen against her textbook, and Marilyn would nod and kiss her on the head and shut the door behind her. Now there is no one to turn her away, but she looks at Lydia's boot, tipped on its side on the carpet, thinks of her daughter kicking it off, and lets it lie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="深切的疼痛将她包围，仿佛连骨骼上都有淤青。但是，这种感觉不错，因为这个房间里的一切都让她想到莉迪亚。达·芬奇的《维特鲁威人》版画和居里夫人手里拿着试管的海报仍旧骄傲地挂在墙上，这些都是玛丽琳在莉迪亚小时候买给她的。莉迪亚从小就想当医生，和她妈妈一样。去年夏天，她甚至去大学旁听了生物学的课，这样就能跳级选修物理课了。记事板上挂着她参加科学展览获得的蓝色绶带、一张图文并茂的元素周期表、一副真正的听诊器——玛丽琳特地为莉迪亚的十三岁生日订购的生日礼物。书架塞满了书，有些书横着挤在排好的书顶上。《医学简史》，这本书莉迪亚是倒着读的，还有《罗莎琳德·富兰克林与DNA》。多年来，玛丽琳给女儿买书的目的就是为了启发她，让她知道自己可以取得怎样的成就，而女儿也在各个方面证明了她的天赋和野心。这个房间里的东西上面已经积了一层灰尘。每次她拿着吸尘器进来打扫，莉迪亚都会赶她出去。“我很忙，妈妈。”她边说边拿笔尖敲敲课本，玛丽琳会点点头，亲亲女儿的前额，走出去关好门。现在，没有人赶她了。她看着斜躺在地上的一只莉迪亚的靴子，想起女儿随意把它从脚上踢下来，让它歪在地上的情景。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somewhere in this room, she is sure, is the answer to what happened. And there, on the bottom shelf of the bookcase, she sees the neat row of diaries lined up by year. Marilyn had given Lydia her first diary the Christmas she was five, a flowered one with gilt edges and a key lighter than a paper clip. Her daughter had unwrapped it and turned it over and over in her hands, touching the tiny keyhole, as if she didn't know what it was for. "For writing down your secrets," Marilyn had said with a smile, and Lydia had smiled back up at her and said, "But Mom, I don't have any secrets."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她相信，这个房间里的某个地方，存放着一切问题的答案。在书架底部，她看到一排根据年份顺序摆放的日记本。莉迪亚五岁那年圣诞节，玛丽琳送给她平生第一本日记本，封面饰有花朵，镀着金边，还挂着一把比回形针还要轻的小钥匙。她女儿打开本子一页一页地翻动，又摸摸那个小钥匙孔，似乎不明白这个本子有什么用处。“是用来写下你的秘密的。”玛丽琳微笑着说。莉迪亚也给母亲一个微笑，说：“可是，妈妈，我什么秘密都没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the time, Marilyn had laughed. What secrets could a daughter keep from her mother, anyway? Still, every year, she gave Lydia another diary. Now she thinks of all those crossed-out phone numbers, that long list of girls who said they barely knew Lydia at all. Of boys from school. Of strange men who might lurch out of the shadows. With one finger, she tugs out the last diary: 1977. It will tell her, she thinks. Everything Lydia no longer can. Who she had been seeing. Why she had lied to them. Why she went down to the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时玛丽琳笑了。毕竟，在母亲面前，女儿会有什么秘密呢？不过，每年她都会送莉迪亚一本日记本。她想起那张被自己划掉名字的联系人清单，上面的那些女孩说，她们和莉迪亚不熟，想起学校里的男生，想起可能突然从暗处闪出来拐走女孩的陌生人。她伸出一根手指，把最后一本日记抠出来，封面写着“1977”。它会告诉我真相，她想。告诉她莉迪亚不可能再说出来的每一件事，她见过的每一个人，她为什么对他们撒谎，以及为什么沉进湖里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The key is missing, but Marilyn jams the tip of a ballpoint into the catch and forces the flimsy lock open. The first page she sees, April 10, is blank. She checks May 2, the night Lydia disappeared. Nothing. Nothing for May 1, or anything in April, or anything in March. Every page is blank. She takes down 1976. 1975. 1974. Page after page of visible, obstinate silence. She leafs backward all the way to the very first diary, 1966: not one word. All those years of her daughter's life unmarked. Nothing to explain anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日记本的钥匙不见了，但玛丽琳把圆珠笔尖塞进锁扣，撬开了薄弱的锁片。第一页，四月十日，空白。她翻到五月二日那页，莉迪亚正是那天晚上失踪的，空白。五月一日，空白。整个四月什么都没记，三月也没有。每一页都是空白。她打开1976、1975、1974年的三本日记，空空如也。她拿出最头上的一本日记——1966年那本，发现上面一个字都没有。什么都没留下，没有她想要的解释。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Across town, James wakes in a blurry haze. It's almost evening, and Louisa's apartment has grown dim. "I have to go," he says, dizzy with the thought of what he has done, and Louisa wraps herself in the sheet and watches him dress. Under her gaze, his fingers grow clumsy: he misbuttons his shirt not once but twice, and even when he gets it on properly it doesn't feel right. It hangs strangely, pinching him under the arms, bulging at his belly. How did you say good-bye, after something like this?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="镇子另一头，詹姆斯眩晕着醒来。已经快到晚上了，路易莎的公寓一片昏暗。“我得走了。”他说，模模糊糊地想起自己做过什么。路易莎裹着被单看着他穿衣服。在她的注视下，他变得笨手笨脚，两次扣错衬衣纽扣，最后终于扣对了的时候，却仍然觉得别扭。衬衣怪异地挂在他的身上，腋下夹着一团布料，肚子上凸起一块。这个样子让他有些不好意思说再见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And while James clicks on his headlights and eases the car into motion, stunned at how much has happened in one day, his son peers through his bedroom window in the growing dimness, staring out at Jack's house, where the porch light has just turned on, where the police car has long since pulled away. Up in the attic, Hannah curls up in her bed, sifting through each detail of the day: the white spot on each of her father's knuckles as he grasped the steering wheel; the tiny beads of sweat that clung to the minister's upper lip, like dew; the soft thump the coffin made as it touched the bottom of the grave. The small figure of her brother -- spied through the west-facing window of her room -- rising slowly from Jack's front steps and trudging home, head bowed. And the faint questioning creak of her mother's bedroom door opening, answered by the quiet click of Lydia's door latching shut. She has been in there for hours. Hannah wraps her arms around herself and squeezes, imagines comforting her mother, her mother's arms comforting her in return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆斯打开前灯，发动汽车，暗自感叹一天内竟能发生如此多的事情。他的儿子躲在暗处，透过他的卧室窗户凝视着杰克家的房子，杰克家门廊的灯刚刚亮起，停在那里的警车早就开走了。阁楼里，汉娜蜷缩在床上，筛选着一天的细节——她父亲紧抓着方向盘，指关节都变白了；牧师上嘴唇沾着一层小汗珠，像露水；棺材接触墓穴底部的时候，发出低沉的声响。她哥哥鬼鬼祟祟地爬到杰克家的门口——她透过卧室的西窗看到的——然后步履沉重、垂头丧气地回家。她母亲卧室传来的可疑的开门声，然后莉迪亚房间的门似乎被推开了。她在里面待了好几个小时。汉娜紧紧抱着自己的脑袋，想象着自己安慰母亲，母亲也拥抱着安慰她的情景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Goodnight," he says finally, lifting his bag, and Louisa says simply, "Goodnight." As if they're leaving the office, as if nothing has happened. Only in the car, when his stomach begins to rumble, does he realize there'd been no lunch at Louisa's apartment, that he had never actually expected there to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“晚安。”他终于说了，随后拿起了包。路易莎简单地回答：“晚安。”好像他们在下班的时候道别一样，好像什么都没有发生。直到坐在车上肚子咕咕作响的时候，他才意识到自己没在路易莎公寓吃午饭，他去那里一直都不是为了吃饭的。">查看中文翻译</div>
