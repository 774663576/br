<div class="line_en">Which accounts for a trainload of extremely disgusted gentlemen in an uproar of fancy vests and neck-wear being spilled from their pullmans in San Antonio in the early morning following the fight. Which also partly accounts for the unhappy predicament in which "Cricket" McGuire found himself as he tumbled from his car and sat upon the depot platform, torn by a spasm of that hollow, racking cough so familiar to San Antonian ears. At that time, in the uncertain light of dawn, that way passed Curtis Raidler, the Nueces County cattleman -- may his shadow never measure under six foot two.</div>

<div class="line_en">If you are knowing in the chronicles of the ring you will recall to mind an event in the early 'nineties when, for a minute and sundry odd seconds, a champion and a "would-be" faced each other on the alien side of an international river. So brief a conflict had rarely imposed upon the fair promise of true sport. The reporters made what they could of it, but, divested of padding, the action was sadly fugacious. The champion merely smote his victim, turned his back upon him, remarking, "I know what I done to dat stiff," and extended an arm like a ship's mast for his glove to be removed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如你很熟悉拳击界的纪录，你大概记得九十年代初期有过这么一件事：在一条国境河流的彼岸，一个拳击冠军同一个想当冠军的选手对峙了短短的一分零几秒钟。观众指望多少看到一点货真价实的玩意儿，万万没料到这次交锋竟然这么短暂。新闻记者们卖足力气，可是巧妇难为无米之炊，他们报道的消息仍旧干巴得可怜。冠军轻易地击倒了对手，回过身说：“我知道我一拳已经够那家伙受用了。”接着便把胳臂伸得象船桅似的，让助手替他脱掉手套。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fight!" snapped McGuire. "Puss-in-the-corner! 'Twas a hypodermic injection. Handed him just one like a squirt of dope, and he's asleep, and no tanbark needed in front of his residence. Fight!" He rattled a bit, coughed, and went on, hardly addressing the cattleman, but rather for the relief of voicing his troubles. "No more dead sure t'ings for me. But Rus Sage himself would have snatched at it. Five to one dat de boy from Cork wouldn't stay t'ree rounds is what I invested in. Put my last cent on, and could already smell the sawdust in dat all-night joint of Jimmy Delaney's on T'irty-seventh Street I was goin' to buy.

<div class="line_en">Passengers on the south-bound saw them seated together, and wondered at the conflux of two such antipodes. McGuire was five feet one, with a countenance belonging to either Yokohama or Dublin. Bright-beady of eye, bony of cheek and jaw, scarred, toughened, broken and reknit, indestructible, grisly, gladiatorial as a hornet, he was a type neither new nor unfamiliar. Raidler was the product of a different soil. Six feet two in height, miles broad, and no deeper than a crystal brook, he represented the union of the West and South. Few accurate pictures of his kind have been made, for art galleries are so small and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in Texas. After all, the only possible medium of portrayal of Raidler's kind would be the fresco -- something high and simple and cool and unframed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="南行火车上的乘客们，看见这两个截然不同的类型凑在一起，不禁暗暗纳罕。麦圭尔只有五英尺一英寸高，容貌既不象横滨人，也不象都柏林①人。他的眼睛又亮又圆，面颊和下巴瘦骨棱棱，脸上满是打破后缝起来的伤痕，神气显得又可怕，又不屈不挠，象大黄蜂那样好勇斗狠。他这种类型既不新奇，也不陌生。雷德勒却是不同土壤上的产物。他身高六英尺二英寸，肩膀宽阔，但是象清澈的小溪那样，一眼就望得到底。他这种类型可以代表西部同南部的结合。能够正确地描绘他这种人的画像非常少，因为艺术馆是那么小，而得克萨斯还没有电影院。总之，要描绘雷德勒这种类型只有用壁画——用某种崇高、朴实、冷静和不配镜框的图画。（注：①横滨是日本商埠；都柏林是爱尔兰共和国首都。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were rolling southward on the International. The timber was huddling into little, dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the downright, vert prairies. This was the land of the ranches; the domain of the kings of the kine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们坐在国际铁路公司的火车上驶向南方。在一望无际的绿色大草原上，远处的树木汇成一簇簇青葱茂密的小丛林。这就是牧场所在的地方；是统治牛群的帝王的领土。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">McGuire sat, collapsed into his corner of the seat, receiving with acid suspicion the conversation of the cattleman. What was the "game" of this big "geezer" who was carrying him off? Altruism would have been McGuire's last guess. "He ain't no farmer," thought the captive, "and he ain't no con man, for sure. W'at's his lay? You trail in, Cricket, and see how many cards he draws. You're up against it, anyhow. You got a nickel and gallopin' consumption, and you better lay low. Lay low and see w'at's his game."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦圭尔有气无力地坐在座位角落里，猜疑地同牧场主谈着话。这个大家伙把他带走，究竟是在玩什么把戏？麦圭尔怎么也不会想到利他主义上去。“他不是农人，”这个俘虏想道，“他也绝对不是骗子。他是干什么的呢？走着瞧吧，蟋蟀，看他还有些什么花招。反正你现在不名一文。你有的只是五分钱和奔马性肺结核，你还是静静等着。静等着，看他耍什么把戏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Rincon, a hundred miles from San Antonio, they left the train for a buckboard which was waiting there for Raidler. In this they travelled the thirty miles between the station and their destination. If anything could, this drive should have stirred the acrimonious McGuire to a sense of his ransom. They sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna. The pair of Spanish ponies struck a nimble, tireless trot, which gait they occasionally relieved by a wild, untrammelled gallop. The air was wine and seltzer, perfumed, as they absorbed it, with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers. The road perished, and the buckboard swam the uncharted billows of the grass itself, steered by the practised hand of Raidler, to whom each tiny distant mott of trees was a signboard, each convolution of the low hills a voucher of course and distance. But McGuire reclined upon his spine, seeing nothing but a desert, and receiving the cattleman's advances with sullen distrust. "W'at's he up to?" was the burden of his thoughts; "w'at kind of a gold brick has the big guy got to sell?" McGuire was only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to a range bounded by the horizon and the fourth dimension.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了离圣安东尼奥一百英里的林康，他们下了火车，乘上在那儿等候雷德勒的四轮马车。从火车站到他们的目的地还有三十英里，就是坐马车去的。如果有什么事能使麦圭尔觉得象是被绑架的话，那就是坐上这辆马车了。他们的马车轻捷地穿过一片令人赏心悦目的大草原。那对西班牙种的小马轻快地、不停地小跑着，间或任性地飞跑一阵子。他们呼吸的空气中有一股草原花朵的芳香，象美酒和矿泉水那般沁人心脾。道路消失了，四轮马车在一片航海图上没有标出的青草的海洋中游弋，由老练的雷德勒掌舵；对他来说，每一簇遥远的小丛林都是一个路标，每一片起伏的小山都代表方向和里程。但是麦圭尔仰天靠着，他看到的只是一片荒野。他随着牧场主行进，心里既不高兴，也不信任。“他打算干什么？”这个想法成了他的包袱；“这个大家伙葫芦里卖的是什么药？”麦圭尔只能用他熟悉的城市里的尺度来衡量这个以地平线和玄想为界限的牧场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A week before, while riding the prairies, Raidler had come upon a sick and weakling calf deserted and bawling. Without dismounting he had reached and slung the distressed bossy across his saddle, and dropped it at the ranch for the boys to attend to. It was impossible for McGuire to know or comprehend that, in the eyes of the cattleman, his case and that of the calf were identical in interest and demand upon his assistance. A creature was ill and helpless; he had the power to render aid -- these were the only postulates required for the cattleman to act. They formed his system of logic and the most of his creed. McGuire was the seventh invalid whom Raidler had picked up thus casually in San Antonio, where so many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger about its contracted streets. Five of them had been guests of Solito Ranch until they had been able to leave, cured or better, and exhausting the vocabulary of tearful gratitude. One came too late, but rested very comfortably, at last, under a ratama tree in the garden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一星期以前，雷德勒在草原上驰骋时，发现一头被遗弃的病小牛在哞哞叫唤。他没下马就抓起那头可怜的小牛，往鞍头一搭，带回牧场，让手下人去照顾。麦圭尔不可能知道，也不可能理解，在牧场主看来，他的情况同那头小牛完全一样，都需要帮助。一个动物害了病，无依无靠；而雷德勒又有能力提供帮助——他单凭这些条件就采取了行动。这些条件组成了他的逻辑体系和行为准则。据说，圣安东尼奥狭窄的街道上弥漫着臭氧，成千害肺病的人便去那儿疗养。在雷德勒凑巧碰到并带回牧场的病人中间，麦圭尔已经是第七个了。在索利托牧场做客的五个病人，先后恢复了健康或者明显好转，感激涕零地离开了牧场。一个来得太迟了，但终于非常舒适地安息在园子里一株枝叶披覆的树下。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon, but it was of but one story, and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud floor "gallery."

<div class="line_en">He led McGuire into the east room. The floor was bare and clean. White curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows. A big willow rocker, two straight chairs, a long table covered with newspapers, pipes, tobacco, spurs, and cartridges stood in the centre. Some well-mounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls. A wide, cool cot-bed stood in a corner. Nueces County people regarded this guest chamber as fit for a prince. McGuire showed his eyeteeth at it. He took out his nickel and spun it up to the ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把麦圭尔领到东面的屋子里。地上很干净，没有地毯。打开的窗户里吹来一阵阵海湾风，拂动着白色的窗帘。屋子当中有一张柳条大摇椅，两把直背椅子，一张长桌，桌子上满是报纸、烟斗、烟草、马刺和子弹。墙壁上安着几只剥制得很好的鹿头和一个硕大的黑野猪头。屋角有一张宽阔而凉爽的帆布床。纽西斯郡的人认为这间客房给王子住都合适。麦圭尔却朝它撇撇嘴。他掏出他那五分钱的镍币，往天花板上一扔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus was instituted the reign of terror at the Solito Ranch. For a few weeks McGuire blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow- punchers who rode in for miles around to see this latest importation of Raidler's. He was an absolutely new experience to them. He explained to them all the intricate points of sparring and the tricks of training and defence. He opened to their minds' view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional sports. His jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them. His gestures, his strange poses, his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them. He was like a being from a new world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索利托牧场上的恐怖统治就是这样开始的。最初几个星期，各处的牧童骑着马赶了好几英里路来看雷德勒新弄来的客人；麦圭尔则在他们面前吆喝，吹牛，大摆架子。在他们眼里，他完全是个新奇的人物。他把拳斗的错综复杂的奥妙和腾挪闪躲的诀窍解释给他们听。他让他们了解到靠运动吃饭的人的不规矩的生活方式。他的切口和俚语老是引起他们发笑和诧异。他的手势，特别的姿态，赤裸裸的下流话和下流想法，把他们迷住了。他好象是从一个新世界来的人物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Strange to say, this new world he had entered did not exist to him. He was an utter egoist of bricks and mortar.

Neither the limitless freedom of the prairie days nor the grand hush of the close-drawn, spangled nights touched him. All the hues of Aurora could not win him from the pink pages of a sporting journal. "Get something for nothing," was his mission in life; "Thirty-seventh" Street was his goal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse. It was then that he became the ranch's incubus, its harpy, its Old Man of the Sea. He shut himself in his room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet, whining, complaining, cursing, accusing. The keynote of his plaint was that he had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will; that he was dying of neglect and lack of comforts. With all his dire protestations of increasing illness, to the eye of others he remained unchanged. His currant-like eyes were as bright and diabolic as ever; his voice was as rasping; his callous face, with the skin drawn tense as a drum-head, had no flesh to lose. A flush on his prominent cheek bones each afternoon hinted that a clinical thermometer might have revealed a symptom, and percussion might have established the fact that McGuire was breathing with only one lung, but his appearance remained the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他来了将近两个月后，便开始抱怨说，他觉得身体更糟了。从那时起，他就成了牧场上的负担，贪鬼和梦魇①。他象一个恶毒的妖精或长舌妇，独自关在屋子里，整天发牢骚，抱怨，詈骂，责备。他抱怨说，他被人家不由分说地骗到了地狱里；他就要因为缺乏照顾和舒适而死了。尽管他威胁说他的病越来越重，在别人眼里，他却没有变。他那双葡萄干似的眼睛仍旧那么亮，那么可怕；他的嗓音仍旧那么刺耳；他那皮肤绷得象鼓面一般紧；起老茧的脸并没有消瘦。他那高耸的颧骨每天下午泛起两片潮红，说明一支体温计也许可以揭露某种征状。胸部叩诊也许可以证实麦圭尔只有半边的肺在呼吸，不过他的外表仍跟以前一样。（注：①“梦魇”的原文是“theOldManoftheSea”，典出《天方夜谭》故事中骑在水手辛巴德肩上不肯下来，老是驱使辛巴德涉水的海边老人。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In constant attendance upon him was Ylario, whom the coming reward of the mayordomoship must have greatly stimulated, for McGuire chained him to a bitter existence. The air -- the man's only chance for life -- he commanded to be kept out by closed windows and drawn curtains. The room was always blue and foul with cigarette smoke; whosoever entered it must sit, suffocating, and listen to the imp's interminable gasconade concerning his scandalous career.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经常伺候他的是伊拉里奥。指日可待的总管职位的许诺肯定给了他极大的激励，因为服侍麦圭尔的差使简直是活受罪。麦圭尔吩咐关上窗子，拉下窗帘，不让他唯一的救星新鲜空气进来。屋子里整天弥漫着污浊的蓝色的烟雾；谁走进这间叫人透不过气来的屋子，谁就得坐着听那小妖精无休无止地吹嘘他那不光彩的经历。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The oddest thing of all was the relation existing between McGuire and his benefactor. The attitude of the invalid toward the cattleman was something like that of a peevish, perverse child toward an indulgent parent. When Raidler would leave the ranch McGuire would fall into a fit of malevolent, silent sullenness. When he returned, he would be met by a string of violent and stinging reproaches. Raidler's attitude toward his charge was quite inexplicable in its way. The cattleman seemed actually to assume and feel the character assigned to him by McGuire's intemperate accusations -- the character of tyrant and guilty oppressor. He seemed to have adopted the responsibility of the fellow's condition, and he always met his tirades with a pacific, patient, and even remorseful kindness that never altered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最叫人纳闷的是麦圭尔同他恩人之间的关系。这个病人对牧场主的态度，正如一个倔强乖张的小孩儿对待溺爱的父母。雷德勒离开牧场的时候，麦圭尔就不怀好意地闷声不响，发着脾气。雷德勒一回来，麦圭尔就激烈地、刻毒地把他骂得狗血喷头。雷德勒对他客人的态度也相当费解。牧场主仿佛真的承认并且觉得自己正是麦圭尔所猛烈攻击的人物——专制暴君和万恶的压迫者。他仿佛认为那家伙的情况应该由他负责，不管对方怎样谩骂，他总是心平气和，甚至觉得抱歉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night Raidler received a message from his old home in Alabama. There had been a death in the family; an estate was to divide, and they called for him to come. Daylight found him in the buckboard, skimming the prairies for the station. It was two months before he returned. When he arrived at the ranch house he found it well-nigh deserted save for Ylario, who acted as a kind of steward during his absence. Little by little the youth made him acquainted with the work done while he was away. The branding camp, he was informed, was still doing business. On account of many severe storms the cattle had been badly scattered, and the branding had been accomplished but slowly. The camp was now in the valley of the Guadalupe, twenty miles away.</div>

In two hours and a quarter Raidler, from a gentle swell, saw the branding camp by a water hole in the Guadalupe.

So gentle was his heart that at that moment he would have pleaded guilty to the murder of McGuire.</div>
