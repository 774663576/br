<div class="line_en">I've never really seen Boggs angry before. Not when I've disobeyed his orders or puked on him, not even when Gale broke his nose. But he's angry when he returns from his phone call with the president. The first thing he does is instruct Soldier Jackson, his second in command, to set up a two-person, round-the-clock guard on Peeta. Then he takes me on a walk, weaving through the sprawling tent encampment until our squad is far behind us.</div>

At first I think that Peeta is the cause of the unease, but by the end of the meal, I realize more than a few unfriendly looks have been directed my way. This is a quick turnaround, since I'm pretty sure when Peeta appeared the whole team was concerned about how dangerous he might be, especially to me. But it's not until I get a phone call through to Haymitch that I understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="451小分队的队员和摄制组的人都把饭从餐厅打来，然后围成一圈吃饭。开始我以为是皮塔的出现令我不安。但快吃完饭时，我发现有几个人都向我投来不友好的目光。这变化真是太突然了。因为刚来时我还很肯定大家关心的是他有多么危险，特别是对我。我给黑密斯打了个电话，才明白了这一切的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The autumn day turns from brisk to cold. Most of the squad hunker down in their sleeping bags. Some sleep under the open sky, close to the heater in the center of our camp, while others retreat to their tents. Leeg 1 has finally broken down over her sister's death, and her muffled sobs reach us through the canvas. I huddle in my tent, thinking over Haymitch's words. Realizing with shame that my fixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignore a much more difficult problem. Trying to rescue Peeta from the shadowy world the hijacking has stranded him in. I don't know how to find him, let alone lead him out. I can't even conceive of a plan. It makes the task of crossing a loaded arena, locating Snow, and putting a bullet through his head look like child's play.</div>

<div class="line_en">At midnight, I crawl out of my tent and position myself on a camp stool near the heater to take my watch with Jackson. Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full view where the rest of us could keep an eye on him. He isn't sleeping, though. Instead, he sits with his bag pulled up to his chest, clumsily trying to make knots in a short length of rope. I know it well. It's the one Finnick lent me that night in the bunker. Seeing it in his hands, it's like Finnick's echoing what Haymitch just said, that I've cast off Peeta. Now might be a good time to begin to remedy that. If I could think of something to say. But I can't. So I don't. I just let the sounds of soldiers' breathing fill the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了午夜，我从帐篷里出来，在营地取暖设备附近找了一张凳子坐下来，和杰克逊一起执行看守任务。博格斯让皮塔睡在没有视线障碍的地方，这样大家都能看得见他。而此时，他并没有睡。相反。他把背包抱在怀里，正坐着用一截短绳笨拙地打绳结。这条绳子我很熟悉，正是芬尼克在地下洞穴时给我的那一条。看到这条绳子，我似乎听到芬尼克在重复黑密斯说过的话——我抛弃了皮塔。现在，如果我能说点什么，也许是弥补的好机会。可我不知该说什么，所以我也没说话，只是默默地听着士兵的鼾声随着夜晚的空气慢慢飘过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After about an hour, Peeta speaks up. "These last couple of years must have been exhausting for you. Trying to decide whether to kill me or not. Back and forth. Back and forth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约一个小时之后，皮塔开始说话了，“最近这一两天你一定很累吧。一直在杀我和不杀我之间徘徊。想来想去，想来想去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That seems grossly unfair, and my first impulse is to say something cutting. But I revisit my conversation with Haymitch and try to take the first tentative step in Peeta's direction. "I never wanted to kill you. Except when I thought you were helping the Careers kill me. After that, I always thought of you as… an ally." That's a good safe word. Empty of any emotional obligation, but nonthreatening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这太不公平了，我的第一反应是抢白他。但我立刻想起了黑密斯的话，我尽量朝与皮塔和解的方向努力。“我从来没想过要杀你，除了那次我以为你在帮助职业选手杀死我。从那以后，我一直把你当成…盟友。”这是一个安全的词，没有任何感情色彩，也不具威胁性。">查看中文翻译</div>

He mentions something he thinks happened, and they tell him if it's true or imagined, usually followed by a brief explanation.</div>

<div class="line_en">This seems like a good idea until I realize that I'll be the only one who can confirm or deny most of what weighs on him. Jackson breaks us up into watches. She matches up Finnick, Gale, and me each with a soldier from 13. This way Peeta will always have access to someone who knows him more personally. It's not a steady conversation. Peeta spends a long time considering even small pieces of information, like where people bought their soap back home. Gale fills him in on a lot of stuff about 12; Finnick is the expert on both of Peeta's Games, as he was a mentor in the first and a tribute in the second. But since Peeta's greatest confusion centers around me -- and not everything can be explained simply -- our exchanges are painful and loaded, even though we touch on only the most superficial of details. The color of my dress in 7. My preference for cheese buns. The name of our math teacher when we were little. Reconstructing his memory of me is excruciating. Perhaps it isn't even possible after what Snow did to him. But it does feel right to help him try.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这看上去似乎是个很不错的办法，但随后我也意识到，真正压在皮塔心头的问题只有我才能回答是或者不是。杰克逊把我们重新分配，轮流看守皮塔。她把芬尼克、盖尔和我分别和一个十三区的战士搭配，这样的话，皮塔总能接近一个熟悉他的人。与皮塔的谈话并不是很稳定。即使极小的细节，他也往往要花很长时间考虑，例如家乡的人在哪里买肥皂。盖尔告诉了他很多关于十二区的细节；对于皮塔两次参加的饥饿游戏比赛，芬尼克是这方面的专家，因为第一次他是指导老师，第二次他是“贡品”。但因为令皮塔困惑的事情大多是围绕我而产生的——并非所有的事都可以靠简单的解释来解决——我们的交流是痛苦的、沉重的，即使我们只触及最表面化的问题。在七区时我所穿衣服的颜色，我喜欢哪种奶酪面包，我们小时候数学老师的名字。在他的心中重构关于我的记忆是非常痛苦的过程。也许在斯诺对他做完那一切之后，这根本是不可能的。但我们感觉确实应该帮助他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The television crew means to provide a sense of heightened jeopardy by releasing smoke bombs and adding gunfire sound effects. We suit up in heavy protective gear, even the crew, as if we're heading into the heart of battle. Those of us with specialty weapons are allowed to take them along with our guns. Boggs gives Peeta back his gun, too, although he makes sure to tell him in a loud voice that it's only loaded with blanks.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next afternoon, we're notified that the whole squad is needed to stage a fairly complicated propo. Peeta's been right about one thing: Coin and Plutarch are unhappy with the quality of footage they're getting from the Star Squad. Very dull. Very uninspiring. The obvious response is that they never let us do anything but playact with our guns. However, this is not about defending ourselves, it's about coming up with a usable product. So today, a special block has been set aside for filming. It even has a couple of active pods on it. One unleashes a spray of gunfire. The other nets the invader and traps them for either interrogation or execution, depending on the captors' preference. But it's still an unimportant residential block with nothing of strategic consequence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta just shrugs. "I'm not much of a shot anyway." He seems preoccupied with watching Pollux, to the point where it's getting a little worrisome, when he finally puzzles it out and begins to speak with agitation. "You're an Avox, aren't you? I can tell by the way you swallow. There were two Avoxes with me in prison. Darius and Lavinia, but the guards mostly called them the redheads. They'd been our servants in the Training Center, so they arrested them, too. I watched them being tortured to death. She was lucky. They used too much voltage and her heart stopped right off. It took days to finish him off. Beating, cutting off parts. They kept asking him questions, but he couldn't speak, he just made these horrible animal sounds. They didn't want information, you know? They wanted me to see it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔耸耸肩，“反正我的枪法也不怎么样。”他似乎一直在专注于观察波洛斯，甚至已让波洛斯感到不安。最后，他的谜团似乎得到了答案，他忐忑不安地问道：“你是一个艾瓦克丝，对吗？从你吃饭的样子，我能看出来。在监狱时，我和两个艾瓦克丝在一起，大流士和拉威尼亚。但是卫兵总是管他们叫红头发。就因为他们在训练中心的时候曾做过我们的仆人，所以也被逮了起来。我眼看着他们被活活地折磨死了。她很幸运，他们给她用电刑，电压很高，所以她一下子就死了。可他却被折磨了两天才慢慢死去。他们打他，割下他的肢体器官，他们不断地问他问题，可他却不能说话，只能发出动物似的可怕的喊叫。那些人并不是想要什么情报，你知道吗？他们只是为了给我看。”">查看中文翻译</div>

We finally know the name of the girl who we watched the Capitol abduct from the woods of 12, the fate of the Peacekeeper friend who tried to keep Gale alive. This is no time to call up happy moments of remembrance. They lost their lives because of me. I add them to my personal list of kills that began in the arena and now includes thousands. When I look up, I see it has taken Gale differently. His expression says that there are not enough mountains to crush, enough cities to destroy. It promises death.</div>

<div class="line_en">With Peeta's grisly account fresh in our minds, we crunch through the streets of broken glass until we reach our target, the block we are to take. It is a real, if small, goal to accomplish. We gather around Boggs to examine the Holo projection of the street. The gunfire pod is positioned about a third of the way down, just above an apartment awning. We should be able to trigger it with bullets. The net pod is at the far end, almost the next corner. This will require someone to set off the body sensor mechanism. Everyone volunteers except Peeta, who doesn't seem to know quite what's going on. I don't get picked. I get sent to Messalla, who dabs some makeup on my face for the anticipated close-ups.</div>

<div class="line_en">We slowly proceed down the hazy street, just like one of our exercises in the Block. Everyone has at least one section of windows to blow out, but Gale's assigned the real target.

After a while, Boggs orders us forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cressida stops us before we can rise, since she needs some close-up shots. We take turns reenacting our responses. Falling to the ground, grimacing, diving into alcoves. We know it's supposed to be serious business, but the whole thing feels a little ridiculous. Especially when it turns out that I'm not the worst actor in the squad. Not by a long shot.
