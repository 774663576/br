<div class="line_en">And so the first moments of this St Swithin's Day find him in a basement bar in Camden with his fifth martini in one hand and a cigarette in the other because why not? Why not have some fun and celebrate her life? He says this, slurs this to his friends who smile at him a little weakly and sip at their drinks so slowly that he begins to regret bringing them along. They're so stuffy and boring, accompanying him from bar to bar less like good mates, more like hospital orderlies, humouring him and making sure he doesn't bump into people or crack his head as he falls from the taxi. Well, he's had enough of it. He wants some release, wants to let his hair down, he deserves it after the year he has just had. With this in mind he suggests that they all go to a club he once went to on a stag night. A strip club.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是在圣史威逊节，他已在卡姆登镇的一家地下室酒吧，一手一浅杯马提尼酒，一手一根烟。为什么不找点乐子，庆祝她曾经的生命？他含含糊糊地说，朋友们浅浅地笑。他们小口甲着饮品，真是太束手束脚、乏味枯燥。他都后悔把他们带来，这哪里像帮哥们儿，说医院的护理员才更合适。他们跟着他在酒吧间奔走，护着他以免他横冲直撞。他受够了，需要发泄，需要放肆。过去的一年这样走过，他有资格纵容自己，于是他建议大家去一家脱衣舞夜总会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he doesn't want sympathy, he wants another drink, and so he drops her hands abruptly and heads back towards the bar. He has no trouble getting served. Just a week ago bombs have exploded on public transport. Strangers have set out to kill at random and despite all the pluck and bravado the city has an under-siege atmosphere tonight. People are scared to be out and so Dexter has no problem flagging down a taxi to take them towards Farringdon Road. His head is resting against the window as he hears Pete and Jack chickening out, offering up the usual excuses: it's late, they have work in the morning. "I've got a wife and kids you know!" says Pete jokily; they're like hostages pleading for release. Dexter feels the party disintegrating around him but doesn't have the energy to fight it, so he stops the cab in King's Cross and sets them free.</div>

Falling from the cab, he worries that the bouncers won't let him in, but in fact he is their perfect customer: well dressed and stupid-drunk.

<div class="line_en">There was a time, not so long ago, when a visit to a strip club would have seemed raffishly post-modern; ironic and titillating at the same time. But not tonight. Tonight Nero's night-club resembles a business-class departure lounge in the early Eighties. All silver chrome, low black leather sofas and plastic pot plants, it is a particularly suburban notion of decadence. An amateurish mural, copied from a children's textbook, of slave-girls bearing trays of grapes, covers the back wall. Polystyrene Roman pillars sprout here and there, and standing around the room in unflattering cones of orange light on what look like low coffee tables are the strippers, the dancers, the artistes, all performing in various styles to the blaring R &amp; B; here a languid jig, there a sort of narcoleptic mime act, another girl performing startling aerobic high-kicks, all of them naked or nearly so. Beneath them sit the men, suited mainly, ties undone, slumped on the slippery booths with heads lolling backwards as if their necks had been crisply snapped: his people. Dexter takes the room in, his eyes slipping in and out of focus, grinning stupidly as he feels lust and shame combine in a narcotic rush. He stumbles on the stairs, steadies himself on the greasy chrome rail, then stands and shoots his cuffs and weaves between the podiums towards the bar where a hard-faced woman tells him single drinks can't be bought, just bottles, vodka or champagne, a hundred quid each. He laughs at the audacious banditry and hands over his credit card with a flourish, as if challenging them to do their worst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="造访脱衣舞夜总会一度被视为一种后现代的行为，刺激中带着不光彩和讽刺。今夜的尼禄夜总会却像八十年代航班的商务舱候机室，一概的银色镀铬装修，低矮的黑色皮沙发，塑料花盆中的植株，透着颓废感，有一种别样的市郊风格派的概念。后墙上有幅小女奴擎着盛满葡萄的托盘的壁画，一看就知是蹩脚画者仿儿童教科书之作。古罗马建筑风格的塑料柱散布室内，让人不适的灯光笼罩着似咖啡桌的低矮平台，映出脱衣舞者、舞蹈家、杂技艺人。她们和着蓝调音乐，各自表演。倦怠的吉格舞、催眠的哑剧表演、骇人的高踢腿，一个个都是裸体或半裸。底下观望的是衣冠不整的男人，他的同类。德克斯特傻笑着，恍惚地适应着室内环境，在致幻药物的作用下，他既惭愧又亢奋。他扶着油腻的栏杆，踉跄着走下台阶，迂回地来到吧台前，被个板着脸的女人告知只论瓶出售伏特加或香槟，每瓶一百英镑。他口中骂着这种霸道的行径，手舞足蹈地递上了信用卡，似乎在挑衅他们使坏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He takes his bottle of champagne -- a Polish brand that comes in a pail of tepid water -- and two plastic glasses, carrying them to a black velvet booth where he lights a cigarette and starts to drink in earnest. The "champagne" is as sugary as a boiled sweet, apple-flavoured and barely sparkling, but it doesn't matter. His friends have gone now and there is no-one to take the glass from his hand or distract him with conversation, and after the third glass the time itself begins to take on that strange elastic quality, speeding up and slowing down, moments disappearing altogether as his vision fades to black and back up again. He is about to slip into sleep, or unconsciousness, when he feels a hand on his arm and finds himself facing a skinny girl in a very short, sheer red dress with long blonde hair, shading into black an inch from her scalp. "Mind if I have a glass of champagne?" she says, sliding into the booth. She has very bad skin beneath the thick foundation and speaks with a South African accent, which he compliments her on. "You've got a lovely voice!" he shouts against the music. She sniffs and wrinkles her nose and introduces herself as Barbara in a way that suggests that "Barbara" was the first name that came to hand. She is slight with bony arms and small breasts which he stares at baldly, though she doesn't seem to mind. A ballet dancer's physique. "Are you a ballet dancer?" he says, and she sniffs and shrugs. He has decided that he really, really likes Barbara.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aren't you going to ask me what it's the anniversary of?" he says, though he must be slurring his speech pretty badly because she asks him to repeat it three times. Best try something more straightforward. "My wife had an accident exactly one year ago today," he says. Barbara gives a nervous smile and starts to look around as if regretting sitting down. Dealing with drunks is part of the job but this one is plainly weird, out celebrating some accident, then whining on incoherently and at great length about some driver not looking where he was going, a court case that she can't understand and can't be bothered to understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你会不会间我是什么纪念日？”他说，口气一定是很含混，因为她请他重复了三次还是没听清。那就直接一点吧。“我妻子整一年前遭遇了车祸。”芭芭拉神经紧张地微笑着，东张西望起来，似乎是后悔在此坐下。对付喝醉的客人是她工作的一部分，不过这一例显然与众不同。为一场事故庆祝，然后语无伦次地嘟哝说，有个司机怎么开车不看路，以及一场她听不明白，也不想明白的官司。">查看中文翻译</div>

Heads turn, amused, as Dexter bawls over his shoulder, you stupid, stupid cow, you don't understand, and he catches one last glance of Barbara, both middle fingers raised and jabbing upwards, laughing at him.

He takes a deep breath, steps back onto the pavement, leans against a wall and checks his pockets. His wallet has gone, and so have his keys, to his flat and his car. Whoever's got the keys and wallet will have his address too, it's on his driving licence, he'll have to have the locks changed, and Sylvie's meant to be coming round at lunch time. She's bringing Jasmine. He kicks at the wall, rests his head against the bricks, checks his pockets again, finds a balled-up twenty-pound note in his trouser pocket, damp from his own urine. Twenty quid is enough to get him safely home. He can wake up the neighbours, get the spare key, sleep it off.</div>

<div class="line_en">Through a plain red door in an alley off Berwick Street he finds an illicit underground dive that he used to go to ten, fifteen years ago as a very last resort. It's a grubby windowless room, dark and dense with smoke and people drinking from cans of Red Stripe. He crosses to the formica table that doubles as a bar, using the crowd for support, but then discovers that he has no cash, has given the last of it to the taxi-driver, lost the change. He'll have to do what he always used to do when he had lost all his money, pick up the nearest drink and neck it. He walks back into the room, ignoring the abuse of the people he stumbles into, grabs what looks like a forgotten can and drains what's left, then boldly takes another and jams himself in a corner, sweating, his head against a loudspeaker, his eyes closed, the drink running down his chin and onto his shirt and suddenly there's a hand against his chest pushing him back into the corner and someone wants to know what the fuck he thinks he's playing at, nicking people's drinks. He opens his eyes: the man before him is old, red-eyed, squat like a toad.</div>

The man snarls, bares his yellow teeth and shows his fist, and Dexter realises what he wants: he wants the man to hit him.

<div class="line_en">When Emma left me all those years ago, I thought my life would go to bits, and it did too for a couple of years. To be honest, I think I went a bit nuts. But then I met this girl in a shop where I was working and for our first date I took her to see me do some stand-up comedy. Afterwards she said please not to take this the wrong way but that I was a very, very bad comedian and that the best thing I could do was give it up and be myself instead. That moment was the moment that I fell in love with her and now we have been married for four years and have three amazing kids (one of each! Ha ha). We live in the teeming metropolis that is Taunton to be near my parents (i. e. free baby-sitting!!!). I work in a big insurance office now, working in the customer enquiries department. No doubt this will sound a bit dullsville to you, but I am good at it and we have a really good laugh. All things considered I am really happy. Our kids are a boy and two girls. I know you have a kid too. Knackering, isn't it?!!!</div>

It has a faecal quality, as if something is decaying inside him. There are broken veins on his nose and cheek.

Without her he is without merit or virtue or purpose, a shabby, lonely, middle-aged drunk, poisoned with regret and shame. An unwanted memory rises up of that morning, of his own father and his ex-wife undressing him and helping him into the bath.

He drinks warm tap water from a dusty pint glass and looks out at the garden in the evening sun. The swimming pool is drained and covered with a sagging blue tarpaulin, the tennis court scrappy and overgrown. The kitchen, too, has a musty smell. The large family house has gradually closed down room by room, so that now his father occupies just the kitchen, living room and his bedroom, but even so it is still too large for him. His sister says that sometimes he sleeps on the sofa. Concerned, they have talked to him about moving out, buying somewhere more manageable, a little flat in Oxford or London, but his father won't hear of it. "I intend to die in my own house if you don't mind," he says, a line of argument that's too emotive to counter.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Feeling better then?" His father stands behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“感觉好些了？”父亲站在他身后了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A little."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好一点了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's that?" He nods towards Dexter's pint glass. "Gin, is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是什么？”他用下巴示意德克斯特手里的粉色玻璃杯，“杜松子酒吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just water."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只是水。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He holds two tins in the air. "Mulligatawny or Cream of Chicken?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将两个罐头举在空中：“咖喱肉的还是奶油鸡的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the two men shuffle around the large musty kitchen, a pair of widowers making more mess than is really necessary in warming two cans of soup. Since living alone, his father's diet has reverted to that of an ambitious boy-scout: baked beans, sausages, fish-fingers; he has even been known to make himself a saucepan of jelly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是两人在散发着霉味的大厨房里忙起来，两个独身男人为做点汤，弄得一摊乱。自独居以来，父亲的饮食回到了创业小伙子的状态：烤青豆，香肠，炸鱼条。哦，据说，他曾做过一锅果冻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The phone rings in the hall. "Get that will you?" says his father, mashing butter onto sliced white bread. Dexter hesitates. "It won't bite you, Dexter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客厅的电话铃响了。“去接个电话吧。”父亲边说边将黄油抹在切片白面包上。德克斯特犹豫着。“它又不会咬你，德克斯特。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Glad to hear it. I thought we'd have soup tonight, seeing as how it's a special occasion. Could you manage a tin of soup?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就好。我想咱们今晚要喝汤，因为今天是个特殊的日子。你能不能做一罐浓汤？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He goes into the hall and picks up. It's Sylvie. Dexter settles on the stairs. His ex-wife lives alone now, the relationship with Callum having finally combusted just before Christmas time. Their mutual unhappiness, and a desire to protect Jasmine from this, has made them strangely close and for the first time since they got married they are almost friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走进客厅，拿起电话，是西尔维。他在台阶上坐下。前妻如今也是单身——同卡勒姆的关系终于在去年圣诞节前夕走到了尽头。他们过得都不开心，加之她恳切地想让贾斯敏受到更多温暖，于是两人竟亲近起来，没离婚时都不见得这样，真是古怪。如今，他们几乎成了朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不。也许是。但我们还是爱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"These things happen. Just don't ever, ever do it again, will you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有些事情总是难免的。只是千万不要有下一次了，好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hears her adjust the receiver. "We do all love you, Dexter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听见西尔维调整话筒的声音，“我们真的都爱你，德克斯特。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think so. She's fine. She will be fine. I told her you had food poisoning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是的。她挺好，她会好的。我对她说你是食物中毒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No reason why you should," he mumbles, embarrassed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不配。”他嘟囔着，感觉很窘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sylvie laughs. "He was very unfazed by it all. 'He's got nothing I've not seen before!'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西尔维笑了。“他很从容，还说，‘他的事儿，没有我没见过的！’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“周六晚上见，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How are you feeling?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你感觉如何？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dexter smiles and winces at the same time. "Is Jasmine okay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯特微笑着，同时一阵畏缩。“贾斯敏还好吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, you know. Bit embarrassed. Sorry about that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，你知道。有点尴尬。我为此道歉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dexter makes a noise that sounds like "No, well, we'll see…" There is a silence. "I should go, Sylvie. Soup's burning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯特发出一串含混的声音：“不，哦，看着吧…”沉默了片刻，又说，“我得走了，西尔维，烧着汤呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I seem to remember you and Dad putting me in the bath."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我大概记得你和爸爸把我扶进浴缸，”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's alright."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="”没关系。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a moment, he replaces the phone then joins his father in front of the television, drinking lemon barley water that has been diluted in homeopathic proportions. The soup is eaten off trays with specially padded undersides for comfortable laptop eating -- a recent innovation that Dexter finds vaguely depressing, perhaps because it's the kind of thing his mother would have never let in the house. The soup itself is as hot as lava, stinging his cut lip as he sips it, and the sliced white bread his father buys is imperfectly buttered, torn and mashed into a puttycoloured pulp. But it is, bizarrely, delicious, the thick butter melting into the sticky soup, and they eat it while watching EastEnders, another recent compulsion of his father's. As the credits roll, he places the padded tray on the floor, presses the mute button on the remote control and turns to look at Dexter. "So is this to become an annual festival, do you think?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，他放好电话，然后和父亲一起坐在电视机前，喝着已经被稀释的汤。汤是在盘子里吃的，盘子的底部有特别的衬垫，可以让人舒服的用着笔记本电脑就餐——德克斯特最近发现这项创新有点令人沮丧，也许因为这样的方式他妈妈永远不会让他进屋的。汤本身就像熔岩一样热，一边啜一边刺痛他切好的嘴唇，而他父亲买的白面包片则完全被涂上黄油，撕碎并捣碎成油灰色的果肉。但奇怪的是，这是美味的，厚厚的黄油融化在粘稠的汤里，他们一边吃一边看着《伦敦东区》，这是他父亲最近的另一个消遣。直至节目结束时，父亲按下静音键，转头看着德克斯特。“嗯，是要每年都来这么一场庆祝？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，还劳您把我扶进浴缸，所以…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's alright," says his father, turning back to the TV. "Silent Witness is on at nine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，”父亲说着文扭过头去，“《沉默的证人》九点钟开演。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dexter laughs and sniffs. "Still a bit drunk, I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯特笑了，轻声说，“我想是，还有点醉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"God, I hope not," says Dexter. "Can't Cassie do it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪，但愿不要。”德克斯特说，“凯西不能做吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sorry," says Dexter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起。”德克斯特说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His father smiles and glances back at him. "I really don't want to have a heart-to-heart. Do you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲笑着向他警了一眼，“我实在不愿意深谈，你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well you'll have to try." He reaches for the remote control. "What do you think I've been doing for the last ten years?" On the TV, his father finds what he has been looking for, and sinks further into his chair. "Ah, The Bill."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须努力去做。”他伸手去拿遥控器。“你想想，我过去的十年是怎么过的？”父亲找到了他想看的，身子向后靠在了椅背上，“啊，《警察故事》。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know yet." Some time passes, and his father turns back to the muted TV. "I'm sorry," says Dexter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还不知道。”父亲转回头看着无声的电视。“对不起。”德克斯特说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well let's not then. Let's just say that I think the best thing you could do is try and live your life as if Emma were still here. Don't you think that would be best?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就这么着。听着，如果可以，你最好去努力地好好生活，就当爱玛还在。你不觉得这样最好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What for?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是为了什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They sit and watch the TV in the light of the summer evening, in the room full of family photographs and to his embarrassment Dexter finds that he is crying once again, very quietly. Discreetly, he puts his hand to his eyes, but his father can hear the catching of his breath and glances over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在夏日夜晚的光亮中，在挂满家人照片的房间里，看着电视。让德克斯特尴尬的是，他不知不觉安静地哭了起来，小心翼翼地用手遮着双眼。父亲听见了他压抑的啜泣，斜眼望过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not my cooking, is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是我烹饪的问题吧，啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'd rather not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但愿不要。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes I'd rather not do that again if you don't mind." With the TV still muted, he starts to flick through the TV channels. "Anyway, you'll be doing it for me soon enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，我的确不愿再于这样的事，如果你不介意。”电视机仍然静音，他换着频道。“不管说什么，用不了多久你又会要我出于的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know if I can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道我能不能做到。”">查看中文翻译</div>
