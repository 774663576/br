<div class="line_en">Okay, so he also reads Tom Clancy novels and the newspapers and does crossword puzzles and tracks his stocks, but those things are all distractions. Given no one to justify it to, the man would stare out the window until he fell asleep. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It just seems so… boring.</div>

And even though she's spent the past year and a half trying to convince us he's a great guy, from what I can tell, the thing he likes to do best is stare out the front-room window. There's not much to see out there except the Bakers' front yard, but you can find him there day or night, sitting in the big easy chair they moved in with him, staring out the window.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, Juli Baker did not wind up on the front page of the Mayfield Times for being an eighth- grade Einstein, like you might suspect. No, my friend, she got front-page coverage because she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好了，朱莉·贝克并不是因为成为了八年级的爱因斯坦而占据了《五月镇时报》的首页，像你可能猜想的那样。不，我的朋友，她覆盖了整个首页，因为她拒绝从一棵梧桐树上下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So this tree, this sycamore tree, was up the hill on a vacant lot on Collier Street, and it was massive. Massive and ugly. It was twisted and gnarled and bent, and I kept expecting the thing to blow over in the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这棵树，这棵梧桐树，就生长在科里尔街山坡的空地上，而且它非常庞大。又大又丑。它扭曲、多节，并且弯曲着，我一直期望着这东西被风刮倒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day last year I'd finally had enough of her yakking about that stupid tree. I came right out and told her that it was not a magnificent sycamore, it was, in reality, the ugliest tree known to man. And you know what she said? She said I was visually challenged. Visually challenged! This from the girl who lives in a house that's the scourge of the neighborhood. They've got bushes growing over windows, weeds sticking out all over the place, and a barnyard's worth of animals running wild. I'm talking dogs, cats, chickens, even snakes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, normally I wouldn't care about someone's yard, but the Bakers' mess bugged my dad big-time, and he channeled his frustration into our yard. He said it was our neighborly duty to show them what a yard's supposed to look like. So while Mike and Matt are busy plumping up their boa, I'm having to mow and edge our yard, then sweep the walkways and gutter, which is going a little overboard, if you ask me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何，正常情况下我不会在乎别人的院子，但是贝克家的乱七八糟让我爸爸很烦恼。他说是我们做邻居的责任是向他们展示一个院子到底该是怎样的。当迈克和马特忙着喂蛇的时候，我就必须修建我们的院子，然后再扫走道和排水，这有一点无聊，如果你问我的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And you'd think Juli's dad -- who's a big, strong, bricklaying dude -- would fix the place up, but no. According to my mom, he spends all his free time painting. His landscapes don't seem like anything special to me, but judging by his price tags, he thinks quite a lot of them. We see them every year at the Mayfield County Fair, and my parents always say the same thing: "The world would have more beauty in it if he'd fix up the yard instead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后你会以为朱莉的爸爸——一个高大、强壮的男人——应该会清理院子。但是没有。妈妈的看法是，他把所有的空闲时间用在了画画上。他的风景画对我来说一点儿都不特别，但是从他的标价来看，至少他自己认为很特别。我们每年都会在五月镇集市上看到他的画作，每次我父母都说同样的话：“世界会变得更美丽，如果他清理好他们的院子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in the third and fourth grades she used to clown around with her brothers in the branches or peel big chunks of bark off so they could slide down the crook in its trunk. It seemed like they were playing in it whenever my mom took us somewhere in the car. Juli'd be swinging from the branches, ready to fall and break every bone in her body, while we were waiting at the stoplight, and my mom would shake her head and say, "Don't you ever climb that tree like that, do you hear me, Bryce? I never want to see you doing that! You either, Lynetta. That is much too dangerous."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到三四年级她总是会和她的哥哥们坐在树枝间，或者剥下厚厚的树皮，他们就能从树上滑下来。好像每一次我妈妈带着我们坐车出去的时候他们都会在树上玩儿。朱莉会在树枝间荡来荡去，准备随时掉下来然后摔断她身上的每一根骨头。每次我们在等红绿灯的时候，妈妈都会摇头然后说：“你永远不要那样爬树，你听见了吗，布莱斯？我永远都不想看见你这样！你也是，琳内塔。这太危险了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So I made a mental picture of how high she'd climbed, and the next day I set off to outdo her by at least two branches. I made it past the crook, up a few limbs, and then -- just to see how I was doing -- I looked down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以我大致确定了她爬了多高，然后第二天我决定要胜过她至少两根树枝的长度。我先踩在枝桠上，再爬过几根大树枝，然后，为了看看我爬了多少，我低头往下看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then junior high started and my dream of a Juli-free existence shattered. I had to take the bus, and you-know-who did, too. There were about eight kids altogether at our bus stop, which created a buffer zone, but it was no comfort zone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后初中开始了，我摆脱朱莉的梦想也被砸碎了。我要乘公车上学，然后你当然知道谁和我一起。大约八个孩子都会一起在公车站，这给了我一个缓冲区域，但不是舒服的区域。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did try to climb it once in the fifth grade. It was the day after Juli had rescued my kite from its mutant toy-eating foliage. She climbed miles up to get my kite, and when she came down, she was actually very cool about it. She didn't hold my kite hostage and stick her lips out like I was afraid she might. She just handed it over and then backed away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Besides his meaty nose, he's also got big meaty hands. I suppose you'd notice his hands regardless, but what makes you realize just how beefy they are is his wedding ring. That thing's never going to come off, and even though my mother says that's how it should be, I think he ought to get it cut off. Another few pounds and that ring's going to amputate his finger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了他巨型的鼻子，他还有一双巨大而肥壮的手。我猜想你并不会太注意他的手，但是真正让你注意到它们有多结实的是他的结婚戒指。那东西从来没被拿下来过，虽然我妈妈说就应该是这样，我还是认为要弄下它把它截断。再增加几磅，那个戒指就会切断他的手指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Juli still didn't show at the bus stop, and by the end of the week I learned from Garrett that she was riding a bike. He said he'd seen her on the side of the road twice that week, putting the chain back on the derailleur of a rusty old ten-speed.</div>
