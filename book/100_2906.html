<div class="line_cn" title="德克斯特的面貌出现了奇怪的现象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coarse, black hairs had begun to appear high up on his cheeks, joining the occasional long grey solitary hairs that crept from his eyebrows. As if that wasn't enough, a fine, pale fur was appearing around the opening of his ears and at the bottom of his earlobes; hair that seemed to sprout overnight like cress, and which served no purpose except to draw attention to the fact that he was approaching middle age. Was now middle-aged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脸上开始长粗黑的胡子，和眉梢零星冒出的灰色头发连成一片，耳孔周围和耳垂下方的灰白细毛也不甘示弱，这些如水芹般一夜之间钻出来，只为了提醒他中年正在迫近。他人到中年了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something strange was happening to Dexter's neck. He had developed this sag, this fleshy pouch under his chin, his bag of shame, like some flesh-toned roll-neck jumper. He stood naked in front of the bathroom mirror and put one hand on his neck as if trying to mould it all back into place. It was like living in a subsiding house -- every morning he woke and inspected the site for fresh cracks, new slippage in the night. It was as if the flesh were somehow cleaving from the skeleton, the characteristic physique of someone whose gym membership had long since lapsed. He had the beginnings of a paunch and, most grotesquely, something strange was happening to his nipples. There were items of clothing that he could barely bring himself to wear now, fitted shirts and ribbed woollen tops, because you could see them there, like limpets, girlish and repulsive. He also looked absurd in any garment with a hood, and only last week he had caught himself standing in a trance, listening to Gardeners' Question Time. In two weeks' time he would be forty years old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脖子也未能幸免。颚下的皮肉开始松弛，像挂了个小肉袋，或者穿了肉色的圆领线衣，实在难看。他光着身子站在卫生间的镜子前，绝望地揉着脖子。这感觉就像住在一座年久失修的房子里，发现它一日不如一日。皮肉也像从骨架上渐渐剥离，多年不问健身的恶果。还有，长肚腩也就罢了，看那胸部，哪还是肌肉，大贝壳似的女气的样子，叫他怎么敢穿紧身衬衫和条纹毛线衣，连带帽兜的衣服穿着也显古怪了。上周，他竟然神不知鬼不觉津津有味地听起《园艺问答时间》。两周后，他就满四十岁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there was the widow's peak, particularly noticeable now after a shower; two parallel byways gradually widening and making their way to the crown of his head, where the two paths would one day meet and it would all be over. He dried his hair with the towel, then scrubbed it this way and that with his fingertips until the path was covered over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后是额尖的头发变成V字形，在一场雨之后，现在特别明显；两条平行发线日渐后移，总有一天在头顶汇合宣告末日。他用毛巾擦干头发，顺手捋几下，遮秃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shook his head, and told himself it wasn't that disastrous. If he turned and looked at himself suddenly, and held his head in a certain way, and inhaled, he could still pass for, say, thirty-seven? He retained enough vanity to know that he was still an unusually good-looking man, but no-one was calling him beautiful anymore, and he'd always thought he would age better than this. He had hoped to age like a movie star: wiry, aquiline, grey-templed, sophisticated. Instead he was ageing like a TV presenter. An ex-TV presenter.

<div class="line_en">Finally, she loved someone and felt fairly confident that she was loved in return. If someone asked Emma, as they sometimes did at parties, how she and her husband had met, she told them: "We grew up together."</div>

<div class="line_en">So they went to work as usual. Emma sat at her computer by the window overlooking the tree-lined street, writing the fifth and final "Julie Criscoll" novel, in which her fictional heroine, ironically enough, became pregnant and had to decide between motherhood and university. It wasn't going very well; the tone was too sombre and introspective, the jokes wouldn't flow. She was keen to get it finished, and yet uncertain what to do next, or what she was capable of doing; a book for grown-ups perhaps, something serious and properly researched about the Spanish Civil War, or the near-future, something vaguely Margaret Atwoody, something her younger self might respect and admire. That was the idea anyway. In the meantime, she tidied the flat, made tea, paid some bills, did a coloured wash, put CDs back in their cases, made more tea then finally turned on her computer and stared it into submission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们像往常一样各自工作。爱玛坐在俯瞰着林荫道的窗口前，对着电脑写小说，《朱莉·克里斯柯》的第王部，也是最后一部。这一回，令人哭笑不得的是，主人公怀了孕，必须在做母亲和上人学之间作出选择。写作进展得不太顺利，调子太严肃、太内省，幽默也显得牵强。她想快点写完它，但没打算好下一步做什么，或者，写什么？一本成人书，涉及严肃的西班牙内战，或是写不久的将来，类似玛格丽特·阿特伍德作品风格的、自己年轻时会去崇拜的东西。都是想法而已。实践之前，要先收拾公寓、泡茶、付些账单、洗衣、收起CD，再泡上茶，最后才打开电脑，恭敬地盯住屏幕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I'm here, doing my VAT, and I keep thinking about you and I just wanted to say don't worry. I've arranged for us to view this house at five o'clock. I'll text you the address, so, who knows. We'll see. Period property, good-sized rooms. It's got a breakfast bar apparently. I know you've always dreamt of one. That's all. Except to say I love you and don't worry. Whatever it is you're worrying about, don't. That's everything. See you there at five. Love you. Bye."</div>

<div class="line_en">At the café, Dexter flirted a little with Maddy, then sat in the tiny stock room that smelt oppressively of cheese and attempted to complete the quarterly VAT return. But the gloom and guilt of this morning's outburst still clung to him, and when he could no longer concentrate he reached for his phone. It used to be Emma who made the conciliatory calls and smoothed things over, but in the eight months since their marriage they seemed to have changed places, and he now found himself incapable of doing anything while he knew she was unhappy. He dialled, imagining her at her desk, looking at her mobile phone, seeing his name appear and turning it off. He preferred it that way -- much easier to be sentimental when no-one was going to answer back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咖啡馆里，德克斯特和马蒂小调情了一番，然后他来到充斥着芝士味，让人压抑的狭小储藏间。他坐下来，预备填本季度的退税表，但今早的小冲突造成的郁闷和负疚感还未散去。他实在没法集中精神，于是拿起了电话。从前总是爱玛主动打电话来和解。不过自结婚八个月以来，他们的位置似乎互换了，她一旦不开心、他也什么都做不了。他拨了号，想象她一定正坐在书桌前望着手机，但看到他的名字跳出来就立马关机。他情愿是这样——不愉快时最好没人去打扰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As routine demanded, Emma worked until two, ate lunch, then went swimming. In July she sometimes liked to go to the ladies pool on Hampstead Heath, but the day had become precariously dark and overcast, and instead she braved the teenage kids at the indoor pool. For twenty minutes she weaved unhappily between them as they dive-bombed and ducked and flirted with each other, manic with the freedom of the end of term. Afterwards she sat in the changing rooms, listened to Dexter's message and smiled. She memorised the address of the property and called back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="依照例行的时间表，爱玛要一直工作到两点才去吃中饭、游泳。七月，她有时喜欢去汉姆斯特德希思的女子游泳池，但暗沉的天色让她觉得不安，于是改去室内游泳池，勇敢地扮起了青少年，在孩子中间穿梭了二十分钟，看着他们跳水、潜水、打情骂俏地好不欢快，自己却不由不悦起来。之后她在更衣室收到德克斯特的留言，她记下了地址，给他回电话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hi there. It's me. Just to say, I'm setting out now and I can't wait to see the breakfast bar. I might be five minutes late. Also thank you for your message and I wanted to say… I'm sorry for being so snappy today, and for that stupid argument. Nothing to do with you. Just a bit nuts at the moment. The important thing is I love you very much. So. There you go. Lucky you! I think that's everything. Bye my love. Bye."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，你好。是我。我出发了，迫不及待地想看看早餐吧台了。我可能会迟到五分钟，谢谢你的留言，我想说…对不起，今天不应该对你凶，不该那么使性子。你没有错。就这样吧。你运气不会错！再见我的爱。再见。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside the sports centre the clouds had darkened and finally burst, letting loose fat grey drops of warm rain. She cursed the weather and the wet seat of her bicycle and set off across North London towards Kilburn, improvising a route through a maze of residential streets towards Lexington Road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面云层渐渐阴暗，终于化作温热、大颗的雨点洒泼下来，天幕一片昏暗。她骂骂咧咧地骑上被淋湿的自行车，得穿过伦敦北区赶往吉尔本，她穿行在居民区迷宫般的小街中，朝列克星敦街骑去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rain became heavier, oily drops of brown city water, and Emma rode standing on the pedals with her head lowered so that she was only vaguely aware of a blur of movement in the side road to her left. The sensation is less of flying through the air, more of being picked up and hurled, and when she comes to rest on the roadside verge with her face against the wet pavement, her first instinct is to look for her bicycle, which has somehow disappeared from beneath her. She tries to move her head, but is unable to do so. She wants to take off her helmet, because people are looking at her now, faces craning over her and she looks ridiculous in a bicycle helmet, but the people crouching over her seem fearful and are asking her over and over again are you alright are you alright. One of them is crying and she realises for the first time that she is not alright. She blinks against the rain falling on her face. She is definitely going to be late now. Dexter will be waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨帘已呈棕色倾泻，爱玛站在踏板上低头蹬着车，隐约感到有什么东西从路的左侧掠过。感觉不是在飞，而是被提起来然后抛出去，当脸贴着地面落在路边后，她本能地去找自行车，但它竟从自己身子下消失了。她试着挪动脑袋，却办不到。她看到一堆人俯身围着她，她想自己戴头盔的样子一定很傻，想把它取下。但这些人似乎很害怕，遍又一遍地问她：你没事吧，你没事吧。其中一个哭了起。来，她才发觉自己不是“没事”。雨水滴在脸上，她只是眨眨眼睛。这下一定要迟到了，德克斯特得等上一会儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first is a photograph of herself at nine years old in a red swimsuit on a beach, she can't remember where, Filey or Scarborough perhaps. She is with her mother and father who are swinging her towards the camera, their sunburnt faces buckled with laughter. Then she thinks of Dexter, sheltering from the rain on the steps of the new house, looking at his watch, impatient; he'll wonder where I am, she thinks. He'll worry.</div>
