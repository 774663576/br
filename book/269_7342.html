<div class="line_en">I remembered that running through the forest like this used to frighten me, that I used to have to close my eyes. It seemed a silly reaction to me now. I kept my eyes wide, my chin resting on his shoulder, my cheek against his neck. The speed was exhilarating. A hundred times better than the motorcycle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想起像这样在森林中疾驰曾经让我害怕，我总是会闭上眼睛。现在看来，这像是愚蠢的反应。我把眼睛睁得大大的，下巴磕在他的肩上，我的双颊紧贴着他的后背。这样的速度让人兴奋，比摩托车要好上一百倍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was not pleased, That much was easy to read in his face. But, without further argument, he took me in his arms and sprang lithely from my window, landing without the slightest jolt, like a cat. It was a little bit farther down than I'd imagined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他并不高兴，这在他脸上很容易就能读出来。但，没有再争吵下去，他把我拥在怀里，轻柔的从窗户跳了下去，几乎没有什么震动，就像猫一样。这比我想象中的要进展的更快一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was so very quiet and dark as he ran through the forest, his breathing slow and even -- dark enough that the trees flying past us were nearly invisible, and only the rush of air in my face truly gave away our speed. The air was damp; it didn't burn my eyes the way the wind in the big plaza had, and that was comforting. As was the night, too, after that terrifying brightness. Like the thick quilt I'd played under as a child, the dark felt familiar and protecting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他背着我穿越森林，呼吸很慢，四周宁静而漆黑，甚至——连那些飞驰过我们的树木都看不见。只有气流迎面扑来，展示了我们的速度。空气很潮湿，它不像大广场上呼啸而过的风一样刺痛我的眼睛，而是给我一种很舒适的感觉。正如夜晚，同样，在那令人胆怯的黑暗背后，就犹如一张薄被覆盖在调皮玩耍的孩童身上，夜色让人觉得亲近，安全。">查看中文翻译</div>
