<div class="line_en">He was in a businesslike mood this Tuesday. The subject was death, the first item on my list. Before I arrived, Morrie had scribbled a few notes on small white pieces of paper so that he wouldn't forget. His shaky handwriting was now indecipherable to everyone but him. It was almost Labor Day, and through the office window I could see the spinach colored hedges of the backyard and hear the yells of children playing down the street, their last week of freedom before school began.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in Detroit, the newspaper strikers were gearing up for a huge holiday demonstration, to show the solidarity of unions against management. On the plane ride in, I had read about a woman who had shot her husband and two daughters as they lay sleeping, claiming she was protecting them from "the bad people." In California, the lawyers in the O. J. Simpson trial were becoming huge celebrities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='底特律那边，报业的罢工者正准备组织一次大规模的节日游行，向资方显示工会的团结。在飞机上，我读到一则报道：一个女子开枪打死了正在熟睡的丈夫和两个女儿，声称她这么做是为了保护他们不受"坏人"的影响。在加州，O·J·辛普森案子中的律师们正成为新闻热点。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here in Morrie's office, life went on one precious day at a time. Now we sat together, a few feet from the newest addition to the house: an oxygen machine. It was small and portable, about knee-high. On some nights, when he couldn't get enough air to swallow, Morrie attached the long plastic tubing to his nose, clamping on his nostrils like a leech. I hated the idea of Morrie connected to a machine of any kind, and I tried not to look at it as Morrie spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在莫里的书房里，宝贵的生命仍在一天天流逝。此刻我们坐在一起，面前放着一件新增添的设备：一台制氧机。机器不大，只到膝盖的高度，是便携式的。有些晚上，当他呼吸感到困难时，他就把长长的塑料管插进自己的鼻子，像是鼻孔被抽血的器械夹住了一样。我讨厌把莫里和任何器械联系在一起，所以当莫里说话时，我尽量不去看那玩艺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Morrie borrowed freely from all religions. He was born Jewish, but became an agnostic when he was a teenager, partly because of all that had happened to him as a child. He enjoyed some of the philosophies of Buddhism and Christianity, and he still felt at home, culturally, in Judaism. He was a religious mutt, which made him even more open to the students he taught over the years. And the things he was saying in his final months on earth seemed to transcend all religious differences. Death has a way of doing that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫里接纳了各种各样的宗教思想。他出生在犹太教家庭，上学后变成了一个不可知论者， 那是因为孩提时经历了大多的变故。他对佛教和基督教的一些哲学思想也很感兴趣。但他最接近的文化还是犹太教。他在宗教上是个杂家，这就使他更加为学生们所接受。他最后几个月里所说的话语似乎超越了一切宗教的特征。死亡能使人做到这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
