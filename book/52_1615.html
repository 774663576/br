<div class="line_en">Finnick snaps awake instantly, rising to counter an enemy. But when he sees the wall of fog, he tosses a still-sleeping Mags onto his back and takes off. Peeta is on his feet but not as alert. I grab his arm and begin to propel him through the jungle after Finnick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬尼克立刻醒了过来，跳起来准备迎敌。但当他看到雾墙向前逼近时，他背起仍在睡梦中的玛格丝，抬腿就跑。皮塔已经站起来了，但却不怎么灵活。我抓住他的胳膊，跟在芬尼克后面，半推着他向前跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Some kind of fog. Poisonous gas. Hurry, Peeta!" I urge. I can tell that however much he denied it during the day, the aftereffects of hitting the force field have been significant. He's slow, much slower than usual. And the tangle of vines and undergrowth, which unbalance me occasionally, trip him at every step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是一种雾，有毒的雾。快，皮塔！”我催促着他。我看得出，尽管他嘴上不承认，白天的电击对他形成巨大伤害。他跑得很慢，比平时慢得多。而脚下的蔓生植物和矮树丛密密层层，虽然偶尔我会脚下不稳，但他却每走一步都被绊倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I look back at the wall of fog extending in a straight line as far as I can see in either direction. A terrible impulse to flee, to abandon Peeta and save myself, shoots through me. It would be so simple, to run full out, perhaps to even climb a tree above the fog line, which seems to top out at about forty feet. I remember how I did just this when the muttations appeared in the last Games. Took off and only thought of Peeta when I'd reached the Cornucopia. But this time, I trap my terror, push it down, and stay by his side. This time my survival isn't the goal. Peeta's is. I think of the eyes glued to the television screens in the districts, seeing if I will run, as the Capitol wishes, or hold my ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回身看着雾墙，它正在以一条直线向前移动，在我身后的两侧都可以看得见。我有种强烈的逃跑的冲动，丢掉皮塔，自己逃命。逃跑是很容易的，我全速跑开，甚至爬到树上，雾气在四十英尺高的地方似乎就结束了，我可以爬到雾气所不能到达的高度。我想起了上次的饥饿游戏，当野狗突然出现时，我就是这么做的。我跑到宙斯之角才想起皮塔。但这一次，我要抑制住自己的恐惧，把它压下去，抛到一边。我感到在各辖区，人们的眼睛正一刻不离地紧盯着电视，在看着我，是像凯匹特所希望的那样临阵脱逃，还是坚守阵地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I lock my fingers tightly into his and say, "Watch my feet. Just try to step where I step." It helps. We seem to move a little faster, but never enough to afford a rest, and the mist continues to lap at our heels. Droplets spring free of the body of vapor. They burn, but not like fire. Less a sense of heat and more of intense pain as the chemicals find our flesh, cling to it, and burrow down through the layers of skin. Our jumpsuits are no help at all. We may as well be dressed in tissue paper, for all the protection they give.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我紧紧抓住他的手，说：“看着我的脚，我踩在哪儿，你就踩哪儿。”这很管用。我们好像移动得快了些，可是不能休息。而雾气始终紧跟在我们身后。雾气中的水滴飘离了雾墙，侵蚀着我们的身体，火烧火燎的，像化学品那样引起皮肤的刺痛。它开始粘着在皮肤上，继而渗透到皮肤的深层。我们的连裤衫如一层薄纸，根本挡不住雾气的侵害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finnick, who bounded off initially, stops when he realizes we're having problems. But this is not a thing you can fight, only evade. He shouts encouragement, trying to move us along, and the sound of his voice acts as a guide, though little more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬尼克最先冲出去，但当他意识到我们遇到麻烦时，停了下来。可这雾不是能与之搏斗的东西，你只能逃跑。他大声喊着鼓励的话，催促我们快速前行，他的声音是一种指引。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta's artificial leg catches in a knot of creepers and he sprawls forward before I can catch him. As I help him up, I become aware of something scarier than the blisters, more debilitating than the burns. The left side of his face has sagged, as if every muscle in it has died. The lid droops, almost concealing his eye. His mouth twists in an odd angle toward the ground. "Peeta --" I begin. And that's when I feel the spasms run up my arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔的假肢碰到了一团攀援植物，我没能抓住他，他摔倒在地上。当我扶他起来的时候，我发现了比起水泡、比皮肤灼烧更加可怕的实情。皮塔左边的脸已经萎缩了，好像里面的肌肉已经坏死，眼皮也耷拉下来，几乎把整个眼睛都盖住了。他的嘴向一侧歪斜。“皮塔”我刚要开口，突然感到胳膊一阵抽搐。">查看中文翻译</div>

I wedge my shoulder, which still seems under my control, under Peeta's arm and do my best to keep up with Finnick's rapid pace. We put about ten yards between us and the fog when Finnick stops.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感到皮塔迈步已经十分困难，芬尼克回过头来帮助我们，他也用力拽着皮塔往前走。我的肩膀好像还听使唤，我用它顶住皮塔的胳膊，尽量跟上芬尼克的步伐。我们跑到离雾气十码远的地方，芬尼克停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whatever chemical laces the fog does more than burn -- it targets our nerves. A whole new kind of fear shoots through me and I yank Peeta forward, which only causes him to stumble again. By the time I get him to his feet, both of my arms are twitching uncontrollably. The fog has moved in on us, the body of it less than a yard away. Something is wrong with Peeta's legs; he's trying to walk but they move in a spastic, puppetlike fashion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雾气里的化学物质不仅使人产生灼热感，它侵蚀人的神经系统。一种莫名的恐惧攫住了我，我猛拉着皮塔往前跑，结果却使他又绊了个跟头。等我把他拉起来时，我的两只胳膊已经无法控制，抽个不停。雾墙就在我们身后，距我们不到一码远，皮塔的腿也不行了，他试图往前走，可是腿却在痉挛，像木偶一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," I say stoutly, although my heart sinks. It's true that Mags can't weigh more than about seventy pounds, but I'm not very big myself. Still, I'm sure I've carried heavier loads. If only my arms would stop jumping around. I squat down and she positions herself over my shoulder, the way she rides on Finnick. I slowly straighten my legs and, with my knees locked, I can manage her. Finnick has Peeta slung across his back now and we move forward, Finnick leading, me following in the trail he breaks through the vines.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's not Mags's fault when I begin falling. She's doing everything she can to be an easy passenger, but the fact is, there is only so much weight I can handle. Especially now that my right leg seems to be going stiff. The first two times I crash to the ground, I manage to make it back on my feet, but the third time, I cannot get my leg to cooperate. As I struggle to get up, it gives out and Mags rolls off onto the ground before me. I flail around, trying to use vines and trunks to right myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始脚下不稳，摔跟头，这不是玛格丝的错。她已经尽全力使自己成为一个轻盈的“乘客”，可问题是，我就能背这么重的重量，特别是此时我的右腿好像已经僵了。头两次摔倒时，我尽力站起来，可第三次摔倒，我的腿却不再配合了。当我拼力站起来时，又腿下一软，把玛格丝一下子甩了出去，她比我还先摔到地上。我胡乱挥动手臂，想抓住藤蔓或者树干把自己支撑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the fog comes, silent and steady and flat, except for the grasping tendrils. Although my instinct is to run directly away from it, I realize Finnick is moving at a diagonal down the hill. He's trying to keep a distance from the gas while steering us toward the water that surrounds the Cornucopia. Yes, water, I think as the acid droplets bore deeper into me. Now I'm so thankful I didn't kill Finnick, because how would I have gotten Peeta out of here alive? So thankful to have someone else on my side, even if it's only temporarily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雾气仍不依不饶、悄然无声地紧跟在我们身后，除了小绺的雾气像翻卷的舌头舔舐着企图接近它的人们，大部分的雾气是一个整齐的垂直平面。尽管我的直觉告诉我应该直着往前跑，可芬尼克却在沿斜线往山下跑。他在远离雾气的同时，正在带领大家跑向宙斯之角旁的水域。是的，水。我心想，酸水珠更深地侵入我的皮肤。我没有杀死芬尼克，真是谢天谢地。不是他，我怎么可能把皮塔活着救出去？谢天谢地在我身旁还有人，即使这是暂时的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finnick's back by my side, Peeta hanging over him. "It's no use," I say. "Can you take them both? Go on ahead, I'll catch up." A somewhat doubtful proposal, but I say it with as much surety as I can muster.</div>

Dragging my useless leg behind me, I stagger after him, having no idea what else to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想喊叫，但我的嗓子像火在燃烧。我朝她倒下的方向刚迈了一步，就听到了炮声。知道她的心跳已经停止，她死了。“芬尼克？”我扯着沙哑的嗓门喊道，可是他已经走开了，继续逃离毒雾。我拖着不听话的腿，蹒跚着走在他身后，不知道还能做什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Moonlight glinting on Finnick's bronze hair, beads of searing pain peppering me, a leg turned to wood. I follow Finnick until he collapses on the ground, Peeta still on top of him. I seem to have no ability to stop my own forward motion and simply propel myself onward until I trip over their prone bodies, just one more on the heap. This is where and how and when we all die, I think. But the thought is abstract and far less alarming than the current agonies of my body. I hear Finnick groan and manage to drag myself off the others. Now I can see the wall of fog, which has taken on a pearly white quality. Maybe it's my eyes playing tricks, or the moonlight, but the fog seems to be transforming. Yes, it's becoming thicker, as if it has pressed up against a glass window and is being forced to condense. I squint harder and realize the fingers no longer protrude from it. In fact, it has stopped moving forward entirely. Like other horrors I have witnessed in the arena, it has reached the end of its territory. Either that or the Gamemakers have decided not to kill us just yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月光洒在芬尼克金黄的头发上，闪着熠熠的光。疼痛的汗珠浸湿了我的全身，我的一条腿已经像木头一样完全没有了知觉。我一直跟在芬尼克身后，最后他也跌倒在地，皮塔仍趴在他身上。我无法控制自己向前走的步伐，一下子撞倒在他们身上，我们三个摞在一起。就在这里，就这样，我们会死去。我心想。可思维是抽象的，它远不如身上的痛楚来得真实。我听到芬尼克的呻吟，设法把身体从他们身上挪开。现在我看到毒雾已经变成了珍珠般的乳白色，也许是我的眼睛在骗我，也许是月光的缘故，毒雾好像被玻璃窗挡住了，正在被压缩起来。我眯起眼来使劲看，发现那些翻卷的毒舌已经不见了。事实上，它已完全不再前进。正如我在竞技场所经历的其他恐怖事件，它已经结束了这次恐怖袭击。抑或极限赛组织者决定先不要我们的命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Time and space lose meaning as the fog seems to invade my brain, muddling my thoughts, making everything unreal. Some deep-rooted animal desire for survival keeps me stumbling after Finnick and Peeta, continuing to move, although I'm probably dead already. Parts of me are dead, or clearly dying. And Mags is dead. This is something I know, or maybe just think I know, because it makes no sense at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta rolls off Finnick, who turns over onto his back. We lie there gasping, twitching, our minds and bodies invaded by the poison. After a few minutes pass, Peeta vaguely gestures upward. "Mon-hees." I look up and spot a pair of what I guess are monkeys. I have never seen a live monkey -- there's nothing like that in our woods at home. But I must have seen a picture, or one in the Games, because when I see the creatures, the same word comes to my mind. I think these have orange fur, although it's hard to tell, and are about half the size of a full-grown human. I take the monkeys for a good sign. Surely they would not hang around if the air was deadly. For a while, we quietly observe one another, humans and monkeys. Then Peeta struggles to his knees and crawls down the slope. We all crawl, since walking now seems as remarkable a feat as flying; we crawl until the vines turn to a narrow strip of sandy beach and the warm water that surrounds the Cornucopia laps our faces. I jerk back as if I've touched an open flame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔从芬尼克的身上滚下来，芬尼克也躺倒在地。我们都躺在地上，喘着粗气、浑身抽搐、大脑和身体都被毒素侵蚀了。过了几分钟，皮塔指着上面，说：“猴子。”我抬起头看到了两只动物，我猜应该是猴子。我以前从来没见过真的猴子—我们家乡的林子里没有这种动物。但我可能看到过照片，这在饥饿游戏中看到过，所以当我看到这种动物时，脑子里立刻出现了这个词。尽管很难看清楚，但这些猴子似乎长着橘色的毛，有成年人的一半高。我觉得猴子的出现是个好征兆，这说明空气是无毒的，否则它们怎么能在这里优哉游哉的呢！就这么，我们静静地观察着彼此，人和猴子。之后，皮塔挣扎着爬起来，朝山坡下爬去。我们都爬起来，现在要我们走简直就跟要我们飞一样，是不大可能完成的壮举；我们一直爬到布满藤蔓的地面变成一窄溜沙滩的地方。宙斯之角四周的水拍打着我们的脸，我突然向后弹去，好像被火烧了一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

"It's stopped," I say again, and this time I must be clearer, because both Peeta and Finnick turn their heads to the fog. It begins to rise upward now, as if being slowly vacuumed into the sky. We watch until it has all been sucked away and not the slightest wisp remains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它停了。”我想说话，可从我肿胀的喉咙发出的却是可怕的呜噜声。“它已经停了。”这次我的声音肯定已经清晰些了，皮塔和芬尼克转过身看着毒雾。毒雾在向上升，好像由真空吸入了空中。我们看着它一点点地被吸走，直到最后的一缕完全消失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, when I have survived the worst, opening my eyes underwater, sniffing water into my sinuses and snorting it out, and even gargling repeatedly to wash out my throat, I'm functional enough to help Finnick. Some feeling has returned to my leg, but my arms are still riddled with spasms. I can't drag Finnick into the water, and possibly the pain would kill him, anyway. So I scoop up shaky handfuls and empty them on his fists. Since he's not underwater, the poison comes out of his wounds just as it went in, in wisps of fog that I take great care to steer clear of. Peeta recovers enough to help me. He cuts away Finnick's jumpsuit. Somewhere he finds two shells that work much better than our hands do. We concentrate on soaking Finnick's arms first, since they have been so badly damaged, and even though a lot of white stuff pours out of them, he doesn't notice. He just lies there, eyes shut, giving an occasional moan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，我洗净了最疼痛的伤口，在水下睁开眼睛，在鼻孔里浸些水，然后再喷出来，甚至反复漱口，好把嗓子眼的毒素冲洗掉。我的状况略微好转，就去帮助芬尼克。我的腿慢慢有了知觉，可胳膊还在抽搐。我无法把芬尼克拽到水里，而这么下去疼痛可能会要了他的命。所以我捧起水洒在他的拳头上。因为他不在水里，所以侵入他体内的毒雾，又慢慢地飘了出来，也是一团团的雾气。我小心不让毒雾再靠近我。皮塔也有所恢复，他过来帮我。他撕开芬尼克的衣服，又在什么地方找到了两只贝壳，这东西比我们的手好使多了。我们先用水浸湿芬尼克的胳膊，这里损伤得最厉害。大团的白雾从皮肤里析出，可他竟没有感觉。他躺在那里，眼睛紧闭，只是偶尔地发出一阵呻吟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rubbing salt in a wound. For the first time I truly appreciate the expression, because the salt in the water makes the pain of my wounds so blinding I nearly black out. But there's another sensation, of drawing out. I experiment by gingerly placing only my hand in the water. Torturous, yes, but then less so. And through the blue layer of water, I see a milky substance leaching out of the wounds on my skin. As the whiteness diminishes, so does the pain. I unbuckle my belt and strip off my jumpsuit, which is little more than a perforated rag. My shoes and undergarments are inexplicably unaffected. Little by little, one small portion of a limb at a time, I soak the poison out of my wounds. Peeta seems to be doing the same. But Finnick backed away from the water at first touch and lies facedown on the sand, either unwilling or unable to purge himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在伤口上撒盐。我第一次真正领略了这句话的含义，水里的盐使我疼痛无比，差点昏死过去。但同时也出现了另一种感觉，好像有什么东西从皮肤里往外抽的感觉。我小心翼翼地试探性地把手伸到水里。好难受，是啊，接着就不太难受了。透过蓝蓝的水，我看到一种奶状的物质从我皮肤的伤口上渗出来。当白色物质消失之后，疼痛也就停止了。我摘下腰带，脱掉跟一块抹布无异的连裤衫，我的鞋子和贴身衣裤好像没有一点损坏。一点一点地，我把胳膊伸到水里，让毒液慢慢从伤口内滤除。皮塔好像也在这么做。但是芬尼克第一次碰到水就退了回去，脸朝下躺在沙地上，可能是不愿意，也可能是不能够，把自己泡在水里涤清毒素。">查看中文翻译</div>

We're lucky no one's attacked us yet. We could see them coming from the Cornucopia, but if all four Careers attacked, they'd overpower us. If they didn't spot us at first, Finnick's moans would give us away soon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我向四周看去，越来越强烈地感觉到我们所处的位置是多么危险。现在是夜晚，没错，但月光太亮，会暴露我们的位置。我们很幸运现在还没有遭到攻击。如果他们从宙斯之角的方向攻击我们，我们也可以看得见。但如果四个职业选手一起攻击，他们的力量将胜过我们。即使他们没有首先看到我们，芬尼克的呻吟也足以把他们吸引过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We've got to get more of him into the water," I whisper. But we can't put him in face-first, not while he's in this condition. Peeta nods to Finnick's feet. We each take one, pull him one hundred and eighty degrees around, and start to drag him into the saltwater. Just a few inches at a time. His ankles. Wait a few minutes. Up to his midcalf. Wait. His knees. Clouds of white swirl out from his flesh and he groans. We continue to detoxify him, bit by bit. What I find is that the longer I sit in the water, the better I feel. Not just my skin, but my brain and muscle control continue to improve. I can see Peeta's face beginning to return to normal, his eyelid opening, the grimace leaving his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们得把他拖到水里。”我轻声说。但是我们不能先把他的脸浸到水里。我们俩一人一头，抬着他，把他掉了一百八十度，然后把他往水里拖，一次只能拖几英寸。先把脚踝浸在水里，等几分钟，是他的小腿，再等几分钟，水浸到他的膝盖。一团团毒雾从他的身体里析出来，他呻吟着。我们继续给他解毒，一点一点，我发现我在水里的时间越长，感觉也越好。不仅仅是皮肤，大脑和肌肉的状况也在好转。我看到皮塔的脸在恢复正常，他的眼皮也睁开了，歪斜的嘴也慢慢恢复。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's just your head left, Finnick. That's the worst part, but you'll feel much better after, if you can bear it," Peeta says. We help him to sit up and let him grip our hands as he purges his eyes and nose and mouth. His throat is still too raw to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在就剩你的头了，芬尼克。这是最难受的部位，可如果你受得了，之后你会感觉很好的。”皮塔说。我们让他坐起来，抓住我们的手，把眼、鼻、口都浸在水里。他的嗓子还肿着，说不出话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finnick slowly begins to revive. His eyes open, focus on us, and register awareness that he's being helped. I rest his head on my lap and we let him soak about ten minutes with everything immersed from the neck down. Peeta and I exchange a smile as Finnick lifts his arms above the seawater.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬尼克也在慢慢恢复。他睁开眼睛，看到了我们，明白了我们在帮他。我把他的头放在我的膝盖上，脖子以下的位置都浸在水里，泡了约十分钟。当芬尼克把胳膊举起来，露出水面时，我和皮塔的睑上露出了会心的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That's a joke, I think. But I don't say it out loud, since Finnick has enough to deal with. He got the worst of the fog, although I'm not sure why. Maybe because he's the biggest or maybe because he had to exert himself the most. And then, of course, there's Mags. I still don't understand what happened there. Why he essentially abandoned her to carry Peeta. Why she not only didn't question it, but ran straight to her death without a moment's hesitation. Was it because she was so old that her days were numbered, anyway? Did they think that Finnick would stand a better chance of winning if he had Peeta and me as allies? The haggard look on Finnick's face tells me that now is not the moment to ask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可是个笑话。我心想。但我没有大声说出来，因为芬尼克正在经受痛苦。他体内的毒素最多，我说不出是为什么，也许因为他个头最高，也许是他出力最大。还有玛格丝。我还是不明白那里发生的事，为什么他放弃玛格丝而去背皮塔。为什么她丝毫没有疑义，而是毫不犹豫地扑向死亡。是不是因为她年事已高，离人生终点站的日子已经屈指可数了？他们是不是都觉得如果芬尼克与皮塔还有我结为同盟，那么获胜的几率就会更大呢？芬尼克憔悴的脸色告诉我，现在还没到问的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have moved out a bit farther into the shallows, floating alternately on my belly and back. If the seawater healed Peeta and me, it seems to be transforming Finnick altogether. He begins to move slowly, just testing his limbs, and gradually begins to swim. But it's not like me swimming, the rhythmic strokes, the even pace. It's like watching some strange sea animal coming back to life. He dives and surfaces, spraying water out of his mouth, rolls over and over in some bizarre corkscrew motion that makes me dizzy even to watch. And then, when he's been underwater so long I feel certain he's drowned, his head pops up right next to me and I start.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我游得更远一点，一会儿脸朗下，一会儿脸朝上，漂在水上。如果水对我和皮塔有用，那么它对芬尼克也同样管用。他开始慢慢移动，试着举举胳膊、动动腿，最后他甚至能游泳了。当然，他并非像我这样有节奏地游水，而是四肢的抽动，很像看到一只动物恢复到有生命状态。他忽而潜下去，忽而浮上来，从嘴里喷出水花，在水里不停地翻转，像个奇怪的螺丝锥，我看着都眼晕。接着，他在水里好长时间不出来，我几乎认为他已经溺死了，他却突然从我的身边冒出来，吓了我一跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead I try to put myself back together. I rescue my mockingjay pin from my ruined jumpsuit and pin it to the strap of my undershirt. The flotation belt must be acid resistant, since it looks as good as new. I can swim, so the flotation belt's not really necessary, but Brutus blocked my arrow with his, so I buckle it back on, thinking it might offer some protection. I undo my hair and comb it with my fingers, thinning it out considerably since the fog droplets damaged it. Then I braid back what's left of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我尽量打起精神。我把胸针从连裤衫上摘下来，别在贴身服上。那条有浮力的腰带一定也是抗酸的，现在仍光洁如新。我会游泳，所以浮力腰带没大必要，但是布鲁托用这条腰带挡住了箭，所以我把腰带也扣上，心里盘算着它应该也能提供一种保护吧。我把头发散开，用手指拢一拢。毒雾毁头发，掉了不少，然后我把其余的头发梳成辫子放在身后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta has found a good tree about ten yards from the narrow strip of beach. We can hardly see him, but the sound of his knife against the wooden trunk is crystal clear. I wonder what happened to the awl. Mags must've either dropped it or taken it into the fog with her. Anyway, it's gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta turns to us, panting from his work on the tree. The tone of my request is so odd that it's alerted him to some irregularity. "Okay," he says casually. He begins to move through the jungle, and although I know he's trying hard to be quiet, this has never been his strong suit, even when he had two sound legs. But it's all right, he's moving, the monkeys are holding their positions. He's just five yards from the beach when he senses them. His eyes only dart up for a second, but it's as if he's triggered a bomb. The monkeys explode into a shrieking mass of orange fur and converge on him.</div>

<div class="line_en">I've never seen any animal move so fast. They slide down the vines as if the things were greased. Leap impossible distances from tree to tree. Fangs bared, hackles raised, claws shooting out like switchblades. I may be unfamiliar with monkeys, but animals in nature don't act like this. "Mutts!" I spit out as Finnick and I crash into the greenery.</div>

<div class="line_en">I know every arrow must count, and they do. In the eerie light, I bring down monkey after monkey, targeting eyes and hearts and throats, so that each hit means a death. But still it wouldn't be enough without Finnick spearing the beasts like fish and flinging them aside, Peeta slashing away with his knife. I feel claws on my leg, down my back, before someone takes out the attacker. The air grows heavy with trampled plants, the scent of blood, and the musty stink of the monkeys. Peeta and Finnick and I position ourselves in a triangle, a few yards apart, our backs to one another. My heart sinks as my fingers draw back my last arrow. Then I remember Peeta has a sheath, too. And he's not shooting, he's hacking away with that knife. My own knife is out now, but the monkeys are quicker, can spring in and out so fast you can barely react.</div>
