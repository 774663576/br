<div class="line_en">"Bite back your tongue," scolded my mother when I cried loudly, yanking her hand toward the store that sold bags of salted plums. At home, she said, "Wise guy, he not go against wind. In Chinese we say, Come from South, blow with wind -- poom!-- North will follow. Strongest wind cannot be seen."</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother imparted her daily truths so she could help my older brothers and me rise above our circumstances. We lived in San Francisco's Chinatown. Like most of the other Chinese children who played in the back alleys of restaurants and curio shops, I didn't think we were poor. My bowl was always full, three five-course meals every day, beginning with a soup full of mysterious things I didn't want to know the names of.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of our two-block alley was a small sandlot playground with swings and slides well-shined down the middle with use. The play area was bordered by wood-slat benches where old-country people sat cracking roasted watermelon seeds with their golden teeth and scattering the husks to an impatient gathering of gurgling pigeons. The best playground, however, was the dark alley itself. It was crammed with daily mysteries and adventures. My brothers and I would peer into the medicinal herb shop, watching old Li dole out onto a stiff sheet of white paper the right amount of insect shells, saffron-colored seeds, and pungent leaves for his ailing customers. It was said that he once cured a woman dying of an ancestral curse that had eluded the best of American doctors. Next to the pharmacy was a printer who specialized in gold-embossed wedding invitations and festive red banners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两排公寓之间的小路尽头，是一块空地，那是个小操场，置着滑梯、秋千架等。操场四周排列着石条凳，老人们常爱闲坐在这里晒太阳，嗑瓜子，用瓜子壳引着咕咕叫的鸽子。但我们最喜欢的，是那头的一条小径，幽暗，静谧，弯弯曲曲地延伸着，对我们来说带有几分神秘。我的哥哥们曾沿着它潜入一家中药铺后门，窥视到老李把那种希奇古怪的蛇虫百脚的干壳，和着什么东西的枯叶和干花，包成一小包一小包地卖给病家。据说有一次，他就用这种祖传的秘方，治好了一位被美国医生宣布了死刑的病人。药房边，是一个印刷房，专门印刷烫金的喜帖和过节用的彩旗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We lived on Waverly Place, in a warm, clean, two-bedroom flat that sat above a small Chinese bakery specializing in steamed pastries and dim sum. In the early morning, when the alley was still quiet, I could smell fragrant red beans as they were cooked down to a pasty sweetness. By daybreak, our flat was heavy with the odor of fried sesame balls and sweet curried chicken crescents. From my bed, I would listen as my father got ready for work, then locked the door behind him, one-two-three clicks.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the corner of the alley was Hong Sing's, a four-table café with a recessed stairwell in front that led to a door marked "Tradesmen." My brothers and I believed the bad people emerged from this door at night. Tourists never went to Hong Sing's, since the menu was printed only in Chinese. A Caucasian man with a big camera once posed me and my playmates in front of the restaurant. He had us move to the side of the picture window so the photo would capture the roasted duck with its head dangling from a juice-covered rope. After he took the picture, I told him he should go into Hong Sing's and eat dinner. When he smiled and asked me what they served, I shouted, "Guts and duck's feet and octopus gizzards!" Then I ran off with my friends, shrieking with laughter as we scampered across the alley and hid in the entryway grotto of the China Gem Company, my heart pounding with hope that he would chase us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小街拐角处，是一家只有四只桌子的名叫“宏新”的餐馆。在楼道的隐蔽处，有扇写着“店主自用”的门，我和哥哥相信，一到晚上，强盗们就会从这扇门后出现。旅游者们从来不上宏新去，因为那里的菜单只有中文字而没有英文。曾经有过一个高加索旅游者，硬要我和同伴们在宏新的橱窗前摆好姿势拍照，橱窗背景是一只浓油重酱的烤鸭。拍完照，我向他介绍宏新餐馆。他问我那里有些什么菜，我就大声数说着：“猪内脏、鸭脚掌，还有章鱼肫……”然后我和伙伴们笑着跑开了。我们逃到中国宝石公司的门洞里，担心他会追上来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Farther down the street was Ping Yuen Fish Market. The front window displayed a tank crowded with doomed fish and turtles struggling to gain footing on the slimy green-tiled sides. A hand-written sign informed tourists, "Within this store, is all for food, not for pet." Inside, the butchers with their blood-stained white smocks deftly gutted the fish while customers cried out their orders and shouted, "Give me your freshest," On less crowded market days, we would inspect the crates of live frogs and crabs which we were warned not to poke, boxes of dried cuttlefish, and row upon row of iced prawns, squid, and slippery fish. The sanddabs made me shiver each time; their eyes lay on one flattened side and reminded me of my mother's story of a careless girl who ran into a crowded street and was crushed by a cab. "Was smash flat," reported my mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再往前走，就是鱼市场。橱窗里展放着一池一池已注定不能生还的甲鱼和其他水产，它们徒然地在铺着绿瓷砖的池里挣扎，同时还要互相倾轧争斗，为自己霸得一份较舒畅的空间。它们上方赫然写着一幅广告：“只供食用，不出售宠物。”穿着血迹斑斑白大褂的屠夫们，麻利地将顾客挑中的鱼剖膛开肚，一边坚决地向顾客保证：“都是活蹦鲜跳，刚刚捕捞上来的。”在生意比较清淡时，我们还能见到一篓一篓活生生的青蛙和螃蟹。大人们警告我们不能去惹冒它们。另外还有成箱的乌贼干，冰冻对虾，鱿鱼和鳗鱼。最令我害怕的是比目鱼。它们那扁平的身子和挤在一边的眼睛，令我想起一个被汽车压扁的小姑娘。我没看见她被碾死的情景，但一想起“压扁了”三个字，我就会联想到这条比目鱼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the Chinese parishioners had donned a Santa Claus costume and a stiff paper beard with cotton balls glued to it. I think the only children who thought he was the real thing were too young to know that Santa Claus was not Chinese. When my turn came up, the Santa man asked me how old I was. I thought it was a trick question; I was seven according to the American formula and eight by the Chinese calendar. I said I was born on March 17, 1951. That seemed to satisfy him. He then solemnly asked if I had been a very, very good girl this year and did I believe in Jesus Christ and obey my parents. I knew the only answer to that. I nodded back with equal solemnity.</div>

There were separate sacks for boys and girls of different ages.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having watched the other children opening their gifts, I already knew that the big gifts were not necessarily the nicest ones. One girl my age got a large coloring book of biblical characters, while a less greedy girl who selected a smaller box received a glass vial of lavender toilet water. The sound of the box was also important. A ten-year-old boy had chosen a box that jangled when he shook it. It was a tin globe of the world with a slit for inserting money. He must have thought it was full of dimes and nickels, because when he saw that it had just ten pennies, his face fell with such undisguised disappointment that his mother slapped the side of his head and led him out of the church hall, apologizing to the crowd for her son who had such bad manners he couldn't appreciate such a fine gift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们都急不可待地打开他们得到的礼物。我早就知道，大包头的不一定就是最好的，一个年龄与我相仿的女孩子，得到一大件礼物，打开一看，不过是一本有关《圣经》人物的画册。而另一个女孩子，选择了一小件礼物，结果是瓶香水。还有，礼物盒里的声响也很要紧，一个小男孩子选中了一份，晃起来会叮当响的礼品，他以为里面一定塞满了一角和五分的镍币，结果打开一看，那只是个锡制的地球形储钱罐，他一下子很失望，结果挨了她妈一个耳刮子后，快快地跟着她走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I peered into the sack, I quickly fingered the remaining presents, testing their weight, imagining what they contained. I chose a heavy, compact one that was wrapped in shiny silver foil and a red satin ribbon. It was a twelve-pack of Life Savers and I spent the rest of the party arranging and rearranging the candy tubes in the order of my favorites. My brother Winston chose wisely as well. His present turned out to be a box of intricate plastic parts; the instructions on the box proclaimed that when they were properly assembled he would have an authentic miniature replica of a World War II submarine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="轮上我抓礼物时，我便小心地用手指触摸着余下的各种礼品，试试它们的分量，估摸里面的内容。最后，我选中了一件沉甸甸的、用闪亮的锡纸包着、扎着红缎带的礼物。我没选错，那是一排十二色的、圆圈状的棒糖，我满意地摆玩了半天。哥哥温斯顿也选得挺聪明，他摸到一盒塑料插板，并附有一张说明书，可以按说明书指示，搭出一艘二次大战时期的潜水艇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vincent got the chess set, which would have been a very decent present to get at a church Christmas party, except it was obviously used and, as we discovered later, it was missing a black pawn and a white knight. My mother graciously thanked the unknown benefactor, saying, "Too good. Cost too much." At which point, an old lady with fine white, wispy hair nodded toward our family and said with a whistling whisper, "Merry, merry Christmas."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个哥哥文森特，则摸到一副棋。那应该说是一份很相宜的圣诞礼物，只是很明显是一副用过的旧棋子，而且还缺少一个黑兵和一个白骑士。我母亲有礼貌地感谢了这位不知姓名的赞助人：“太破费了！”这时，一个满头银丝的老太太，对我们全家颔首微笑着：“圣诞快乐！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As our mother sprinkled flour and rolled out small doughy circles for the steamed dumplings that would be our dinner that night, Vincent explained the rules, pointing to each piece. "You have sixteen pieces and so do I. One king and queen, two bishops, two knights, two castles, and eight pawns. The pawns can only move forward one step, except on the first move. Then they can move two. But they can only take men by moving crossways like this, except in the beginning, when you can move ahead and take another pawn."</div>

<div class="line_en">I also found out why I should never reveal "why" to others. A little knowledge withheld is a great advantage one should store for future use. That is the power of chess. It is a game of secrets in which one must show and never tell.</div>

<div class="line_en">I learned about opening moves and why it's important to control the center early on; the shortest distance between two points is straight down the middle. I learned about the middle game and why tactics between two adversaries are like clashing ideas; the one who plays better has the clearest plans for both attacking and getting out of traps. I learned why it is essential in the endgame to have foresight, a mathematical understanding of all possible moves, and patience; all weaknesses and advantages become evident to a strong adversary and are obscured to a tiring opponent. I discovered that for the whole game one must gather invisible strengths and see the endgame before the game begins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，我领悟了其中的不少奥妙，如何开棋？进而如何控制全局？一个好棋手，每考虑走一步，总要想到以后的三步四步，目光要远，而且得学会忍耐和不露声色，要会先发制人。我开始学会在棋盘前聚精会神，每走一个子，都三思而行，考虑它的后果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I loved the secrets I found within the sixty-four black and white squares. I carefully drew a handmade chessboard and pinned it to the wall next to my bed, where at night I would stare for hours at imaginary battles.

<div class="line_en">Her black men advanced across the plane, slowly marching to each successive level as a single unit. My white pieces screamed as they scurried and fell off the board one by one.
