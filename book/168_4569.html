<div class="line_en">Jon could not remember the last time he had slept. When he closed his eyes he dreamed of fighting; when he woke he fought. Even in the King's Tower he could hear the ceaseless thunk of bronze and flint and stolen steel biting into wood, and it was louder when he tried to rest in the warming shed atop the Wall. Mance had sledgehammers at work as well, and long saws with teeth of bone and flint. Once, as he was drifting off into an exhausted sleep, there came a great cracking from the haunted forest, and a sentinel tree came crashing down in a cloud of dirt and needles.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was awake when Owen came to him, lying restless under a pile of furs on the floor of the warming shed. "Lord Snow," said Owen, shaking his shoulder, "the dawn." He gave Jon a hand to help pull him back onto his feet. Others were waking as well, jostling one another as they pulled on their boots and buckled their swordbelts in the close confines of the shed. No one spoke. They were all too tired for talk. Few of them ever left the Wall these days. it took too long to ride up and down in the cage. Castle Black had been abandoned to Maester Aemon, Ser Wynton Stout, and a few others too old or ill to fight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon made himself smile. "That would be a welcome sight to see, Owen." Ignoring the twinge of pain in his leg, he swept a black fur cloak about his shoulders, gathered up his crutch, and went out onto the Wall to face another day.</div>

<div class="line_en">A gust of wind sent icy tendrils wending through his long brown hair. Half a mile north, the wildling encampments were stirring, their campfires sending up smoky fingers to scratch against the pale dawn sky. Along the edge of the forest they had raised their tents of hide and fur, even a crude longhall of logs and woven branches; there were horselines to the east, mammoths to the west, and men everywhere, sharpening their swords, putting points on crude spears, donning makeshift armor of hide and horn and bone. For every man that he could see, Jon knew there were a score unseen in the wood. The brush gave them some shelter from the elements and hid them from the eyes of the hated crows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵风将丝丝冷空气吹入他长长的棕发。北方半里远处，野人营地忙碌不堪，无数篝火升起根根烟柱，如手指般抓向苍白的天空。他们沿森林边缘搭起兽皮或毛皮帐篷，甚至用圆木和树枝建造了一个简陋长厅；东边是马群，西边是长毛象，到处都是人，有的在磨剑，有的给粗陋的长矛上尖头，有的则穿上兽皮、兽角和骨头制作的简易盔甲。琼恩知道，森林里的人更有外面的数十倍之多。灌木提供了屏障，把他们从仇恨的乌鸦眼前隐藏起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Already their archers were stealing forward, pushing their rolling mantlets. "Here come our breakfast arrows," Pyp announced cheerfully, as he did every morning. It's good that he can make a jape of it, Jon thought. Someone has to. Three days ago, one of those breakfast arrows had caught Red Alyn of the Rosewood in the leg. You could still see his body at the foot of the Wall, if you cared to lean out far enough. Jon had to think that it was better for them to smile at Pyp's jest than to brood over Alyn's corpse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的弓箭手已推着掩体悄悄前进。“早餐箭来了。”派普天天早上都会这样愉快地宣布。他能这么说是件好事，琼恩心想，总得有人开开玩笑。三天前，一支“早餐箭”射中玫瑰林的红埃林的大腿。直到现在，如果你愿意冒险探出城头，还可以看到他的尸体躺在长城脚下。让大家对派普的笑话抱以微笑总好过念念不忘死去的埃林，琼恩只能这么想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mantlets were slanting wooden shields, wide enough for five of the free folk to hide behind. The archers pushed them close, then knelt behind them to loose their arrows through slits in the wood. The first time the wildlings rolled them out, Jon had called for fire arrows and set a half -dozen ablaze, but after that Mance started covering them with raw hides. All the fire arrows in the world couldn't make them catch now. The brothers had even started wagering as to which of the straw sentinels would collect the most arrows before they were done. Dolorous Edd was leading with four, but Othell Yarwyck, Tumberjon, and Watt of Long Lake had three apiece. It was Pyp who'd started naming the scarecrows after their missing brothers, too. "It makes it seem as if there's more of us," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="掩体乃是装有轮子的倾斜木板，宽度足够遮蔽五名自由民。弓箭手们推它移近，然后跪在后面通过缝隙放箭。野人第一次使用该战术时，琼恩下令以火箭回击，烧掉了其中六个，之后，曼斯改用生兽皮覆盖木板，于是无论多少火箭都无济于事。百无聊赖中，黑衣弟兄们开始打赌哪个稻草人哨兵中箭最多。目前忧郁的艾迪以四箭保持领先，但奥赛尔·亚威克、筋斗琼和长湖的瓦特也不遑多让，各少一箭而已。最开始用不在长城上的守夜人来命名稻草人的也是派普。“这样的话，我们就好像有更多弟兄了。”他解释。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the edge of the Wall an ornate brass Myrish eye stood on three spindly legs. Maester Aemon had once used it to peer at the stars, before his own eyes had failed him. Jon swung the tube down to have a look at the foe. Even at this distance there was no mistaking Mance Rayder's huge white tent, sewn together from the pelts of snow bears. The Myrish lenses brought the wildlings close enough for him to make out faces. Of Mance himself he saw no sign this morning, but his woman Dalla was outside tending the fire, while her sister Val milked a she-goat beside the tent. Dalla looked so big it was a wonder she could move. The child must be coming very soon, Jon thought. He swiveled the eye east and searched amongst the tents and trees till he found the turtle. That will be coming very soon as well. The wildlings had skinned one of the dead mammoths during the night, and they were lashing the raw bloody hide over the turtle's roof, one more layer on top of the sheepskins and pelts. The turtle had a rounded top and eight huge wheels, and under the hides was a stout wooden frame. When the wildlings had begun knocking it together, Satin thought they were building a ship. Not far wrong. The turtle was a hull turned upside down and opened fore and aft; a longhall on wheels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冰墙边有个装饰精美的密尔黄铜透镜，支在三脚架上，伊蒙学士失明前用它来观测星象。琼恩将长筒转向下方，侦察敌人。虽然距离遥远，曼斯·雷德的巨大雪熊皮白帐篷仍清晰可辨。通过密尔透镜，他可以看清野人们的脸。今天早上，曼斯本人不见踪影，但他的女人妲娜在外照料火堆，她妹妹瓦迩则于帐篷边给母山羊挤奶。妲娜肚子好大，还能走动简直是奇迹。她快要生了，琼恩心想。他将透镜旋向东方，在帐篷和树丛间搜寻，找到建造中的龟盾。这个也快要完工了。野人们趁夜剥了一头死长毛象，此刻正将血淋淋的生皮覆到龟盾顶上，在羊皮和兽皮外多加一层防护。龟盾为圆顶，外加八个大轮子，兽皮下是牢固的木制框架。野人们刚开始钉框架时，纱丁以为对方在造船。其实差不多。龟盾活像颠倒过来的船身，只是前后开口，准确地说，是一座架在轮子上的长厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"More of us with arrows in our bellies," Grenn complained, but the custom did seem to give his brothers heart, so Jon let the names stand and the wagering continue.</div>

He had grown half a foot, his chest and shoulders had thickened, and he had not cut his hair nor trimmed his beard since the Fist of the First Men. It made him look as huge and shaggy as an aurochs, the mocking name that Ser Alliser Thorne had hung on him during training. He looked weary now, though. When Jon said as much, he nodded. "I heard their axes all night. Couldn't sleep for all the chopping."</div>

<div class="line_en">Grenn went off muttering, and Jon returned to the far eye, searching the wildling camp. From time to time an arrow would sail past overhead, but he had learned to ignore those. The range was long and the angle was bad, the chances of being hit were small. He still saw no sign of Mance Rayder in the camp, but he spied Tormund Giantsbane and two of his sons around the turtle. The sons were struggling with the mammoth hide while Tormund gnawed on the roast leg of a goat and bellowed orders. Elsewhere he found the wildling skinchanger, Varamyr Sixskins, walking through the trees with his shadowcat dogging his heels.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he heard the rattle of the winch chains and the iron groan of the cage door opening, he knew it would be Hobb bringing their breakfast as he did every morning. The sight of Mance's turtle had robbed Jon of his appetite. Their oil was all but gone, and the last barrel of pitch had been rolled off the Wall two nights ago. They would soon run short of arrows as well, and there were no fletchers making more. And the night before last, a raven had come from the west, from Ser Denys Mallister. Bowen Marsh had chased the wildlings all the way to the Shadow Tower, it seemed, and then farther, down into the gloom of the Gorge. At the Bridge of Skulls he had met the Weeper and three hundred wildlings and won a bloody battle. But the victory had been a costly one. More than a hundred brothers slain, among them Ser Endrew Tarth and Ser Aladale Wynch. The Old Pomegranate himself had been carried back to the Shadow Tower sorely wounded. Maester Mullin was tending him, but it would be some time before he was fit to return to Castle Black.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had read that, Jon had dispatched Zei to Mole's Town on their best horse to plead with the villagers to help man the Wall. She never returned. When he sent Mully after her, he came back to report the whole village deserted, even the brothel. Most likely Zei had followed them, straight down the kingsroad. Maybe we should all do the same, Jon reflected glumly.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one needed to ask what "it" was. Nor did Jon need the maester's Myrish eye to see it creeping out from amongst the tents and trees. "It doesn't really look much like a turtle," Satin commented. "Turtles don't have fur."</div>

If the wildlings were coming, the Wall would need every man. Gods know, we have fewenough. Jon looked at Pyp and Kegs and Satin, Horse and Owen the Oaf, Tim Tangletongue, Mully, Spare Boot, and the rest, and tried to imagine them going belly to belly and blade to blade against a hundred screaming wildlings, in the freezing darkness of that tunnel, with only a few iron bars between them.

<div class="line_en">He could see that for himself. Inch by inch, yard by yard, the turtle crept closer, rolling, rumbling and rocking as it crossed the killing ground. Once the wildlings got it flush against the Wall, it would give them all the shelter they needed while their axes crashed through the hastily-repaired outer gates. Inside, under the ice, they would clear the loose rubble from the tunnel in a matter of hours, and then there would be nothing to stop them but two iron gates, a few half-frozen corpses, and whatever brothers Jon cared to throw in their path, to fight and die down in the dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alongside the warming shed a dozen stout oaken barrels were lined up in a row. They were full of crushed rock; the gravel that the black brothers customarily spread on the footpaths to give themselves better footing atop the Wall. Yesterday, after he'd seen the free folk covering the turtle with sheepskins, Jon told Grerm to pour water into the barrels, as much as they would take. The water would seep down through the crushed stone, and overnight the whole thing would freeze solid. It was the nearest thing to a boulder they were going to get.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The hides won't burn," Jon said, as much to himself as to the others. Their only hope was to try and crush the turtle when it reached the Wall. For that, they needed boulders.

<div class="line_en">They had four of the big oak barrels lined up above the gate by the time Pyp shouted, "There's a turtle at our door!" Jon braced his injured leg and leaned out for a look. Hoardings, Marsh should have built hoardings. So many things they should have done. The wildlings were dragging the dead giants away from the gate. Horse and Mully were dropping rocks down on them, and Jon thought he saw one man go down, but the stones were too small to have any effect on the turtle itself. He wondered what the free folk would do about the dead mammoth in the path, but then he saw. The turtle was almost as wide as a longhall, so they simply pushed it over the carcass. His leg twitched, but Horse caught his arm and drew him back to safety. "You shouldn't lean out like that," the boy said.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="俘虏眨眨黄色的眼睛。“是的。”琼恩这才认出是“叮当衫”。没了那身盔甲，他看起来像换了个人，他心想。“是的，”野人重复，“他就是杀死断掌的懦夫。在霜雪之牙，我们追踪乌鸦，将他们统统杀光，轮到这家伙时，他乞求饶命，还提出如果我们愿意收留，立即投靠加入。断掌发誓要宰了胆小鬼，但那头狼突袭科林，这家伙趁机割了他喉咙。”他露出参差碎裂的牙齿对琼恩笑笑，然后朝后者的靴子啐了口血水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Glendon was the tall man who had dragged Jon from his bed. Four other men went with him when he left the room, but they were back soon enough with a captive, a small, sallow, battered man fettered hand and foot. He had a single eyebrow, a widow's peak, and a mustache that looked like a smear of dirt on his upper lip, but his face was swollen and mottled with bruises, and most of his front teeth had been knocked out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葛兰登爵士就是那带人将琼恩从床上拉起来的高个子。此刻他又带着四人出去，很快将一名瘦小俘虏押回来。此人面如菜色，垂头丧气，手脚戴镣，一条细眉毛横贯前额，尖秃头顶有几丛稀薄黑发，小胡子如嘴唇上方的一抹污渍。他脸颊肿胀，布满块块淤青，大半前齿也被打落。">查看中文翻译</div>

"He murdered Qhorin just as his fellow turncloaks did Lord Mormont. it would not surprise me to learn that it was all part of the same fell plot.

<div class="line_en">"They are the gods of the north, Septon." Maester Aemon was courteous, but firm. "My lords, when Donal Noye was slain, it was this young man Jon Snow who took the Wall and held it, against all the fury of the north. He has proved himself valiant, loyal, and resourceful. Were it not for him, you would have found Mance Rayder sitting here when you arrived, Lord Slynt. You are doing him a great wrong. Jon Snow was Lord Mormont's own steward and squire. He was chosen for that duty because the Lord Commander saw much promise in him. As do I."</div>
