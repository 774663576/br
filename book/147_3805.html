<div class="line_en">In that enormous silence, where pain and darkness met, some birds were waking. It was October. It was almost four o'clock in the morning. Eliza straightened out Ben's limbs, and folded his hands across his body. She smoothed out the rumpled covers of the bed, and patted out the pillows, making a smooth hollow for his head to rest in. His flashing hair, cropped close to his well-shaped head, was crisp and crinkly as a boy's, and shone with bright points of light. With a pair of scissors, she snipped off a little lock where it would not show.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene and Luke went softly up the hall, and out into the dark. Gently, they closed the big front door behind them, and descended the veranda steps. In that enormous silence, birds were waking. It was a little after four o'clock in the morning. Wind pressed the boughs. It was still dark. But above them the thick clouds that had covered the earth for days with a dreary gray blanket had been torn open. Eugene looked up through the deep ragged vault of the sky and saw the proud and splendid stars, bright and unwinking. The withered leaves were shaking.</div>

<div class="line_en">A cock crew his shrill morning cry of life beginning and awaking. The cock that crew at midnight (thought Eugene) had an elfin ghostly cry. His crow was drugged with sleep and death: it was like a far horn sounding under sea; and it was a warning to all the men who are about to die, and to the ghosts that must go home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一只公鸡发出清脆的啼鸣声，正在宣告生命的开始和又一日的苏醒。午夜的鸡鸣有点像精灵可怕的哭号。它的啼叫带来一种睡眠和死亡的意味，令人沉醉，就像从遥远的大海深处传来的号角声，正在警告所有即将死亡的人，还有所有必须回家的灵魂。">查看中文翻译</div>

As he came opposite Dixieland, he moved in to the curb, tossing his fresh paper with a careful plop. He knew there was sickness in the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个报童正匆匆忙忙地走在街道中央，准确地把折成方块的报纸朝布伦斯维克公寓的凉台投掷过去。这个孩子走起路来一瘸一拐的，尤金非常熟悉这个姿势。他走到南都旅馆的对面，来到路边，小心地举起手中的报纸，投掷在凉台上。他知道这家有病人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但是清晨的鸡鸣就像长笛发出的声音一样清脆、悠扬。它正在向人们诉说，我们已经睡醒，我们已经结束了死亡。哦，醒来吧，继续生活吧，长笛般的消脆啼鸣声似乎这样向我们诉说。四周一片寂静，鸟雀正在醒来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He heard the cock's bright minstrelsy again, and by the river in the dark, the great thunder of flanged wheels, and the long retreating wail of the whistle.

<div class="line_en">How like Death this man is (thought Eugene). He thought of the awful mysteries of burial -- the dark ghoul-ritual, the obscene communion with the dead, touched with some black and foul witch-magic. Where is the can in which they throw the parts? There is a restaurant near here. Then he took the cold phthisic hand, freckled on its back, that the man extended, with a sense of having touched something embalmed. The undertaker's manner had changed since the morning: it had become official, professional. He was the alert marshal of their grief, the efficient master-of-ceremonies. Subtly he made them feel there was an order and decorum in death: a ritual of mourning that must be observed. They were impressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个人多么像死神啊。他想起了可怕而神秘的葬礼——那些阴森森的仪式、和死人的对话，全都像某种阴暗、污秽的巫术。不知道他们会把死人的内脏扔到怎样的垃圾桶里去？在这附近有一个饭馆。当那人伸出一只布满斑点、冰冷的手跟他握手时，他感到自己似乎碰到了涂过防腐油的尸体。这位殡仪馆老板的态度和早晨相比发生了一些变化：现在完全是一副公事公办、十分专业的派头。他处事非常机敏，善于把握对方悲伤的情绪，对丧葬礼仪也能应付自如。他不必明说，他在一举一动中便巧妙地向他们表明，死亡也是有规矩礼仪的，因此丧葬必须遵守一定的规矩和礼仪。他们不由得心悦诚服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Horse Hines nodded with grave approval. Then he led them softly back, into a large dark room with polished waxen floors where, amid a rich dead smell of wood and velvet, upon wheeled trestles, the splendid coffins lay in their proud menace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“马面”韩斯表情沉重地点了点头。然后，他领着他们哥俩轻手轻脚地向一间黑暗的大屋子走去。屋内的地板已经打了蜡，室内的空气很不流通，所以散发出一股浓重的木料和绒布气味，在带有转轮的支架上，安放着一口口崭新的棺材，令人望而怯步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I take a personal interest in this funeral," said Horse Hines with gentle emotion. "I have known the Gant and Pentland families for thirty years or more. I have had business dealings with your father for nigh on to twenty years."'马面'韩斯充满感情地说,"我和你们甘特家、彭特兰家已经有30多年的交情了.我跟你父亲做生意也有将近20年的历史了."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ben, clad in his best suit of clothes, a neat one of dark gray-black, lay in rigid tranquillity upon a table. His hands, cold and white, with clean dry nails, withered a little like an old apple, were crossed loosely on his stomach. He had been closely shaved: he was immaculately groomed. The rigid head was thrust sharply upward, with a ghastly counterfeit of a smile: there was a little gum of wax at the nostrils, and a waxen lacing between the cold firm lips. The mouth was tight, somewhat bulging. It looked fuller than it ever had looked before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本恩穿着他最好的衣服——一套整洁的灰黑色西装——僵硬而安详地躺在一张台子上。他的手苍白而冰冷，指甲剔得很干净，手皮干皱，像干苹果一样，松松地交叉在腹部。他的胡子已经被仔细地刮过了，简直被修饰得无懈可击。他僵硬的脑袋向上仰起，脸上露出一丝可怕的虚假笑容；他的鼻孔里放了一点蜡，冰冷紧闭的唇间也涂上了一层蜡油。他的嘴部微微地向上鼓起，比他生前的时候更加饱满了一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That sells for $450," said Horse Hines. "But," he added, after a moment's dark reflection, "I'll tell you what I'll do. Your father and I are old friends. Out of respect for the family, I'll let you have it at cost --$375."</div>
