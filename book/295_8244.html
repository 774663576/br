<div class="line_en">A cold December wind was blowing, and Theresa Osborne crossed her arms as she stared out over the water. Earlier, when she'd arrived, there had been a few people walking along the shore, but they'd taken note of the clouds and were long since gone. Now she found herself alone on the beach, and she took in her surroundings. The ocean, reflecting the color of the sky, looked like liquid iron, and waves rolled up steadily on the shore. Heavy clouds were descending slowly, and the fog was beginning to thicken, making the horizon invisible. In another place, in another time, she would have felt the majesty of the beauty around her, but as she stood on the beach, she realized that she didn't feel anything at all. In a way, she felt as if she weren't really here, as if the whole thing was nothing but a dream.</div>

She'd made the arrangements and had even looked forward to a quiet night away from Boston, but watching the ocean swirl and churn made her realize that she didn't want to stay. She would drive home as soon as she was finished, no matter how late it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she was finally ready, Theresa slowly started to walk toward the water. Beneath her arm she carried a bag that she had carefully packed that morning, making sure that she hadn't forgotten anything. She hadn't told anyone what she carried with her, nor had she told them what she'd intended to do today. Instead she'd said that she was going Christmas shopping. It was the perfect excuse, and though she was sure that they would have understood had she told them the truth, this trip was something she didn't want to share with anyone. It had started with her alone, and that was the same way she wanted it to end.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa sighed and checked her watch. Soon it would be high tide, and it was then that she would finally be ready. After finding a spot on a small dune that looked comfortable, she sat in the sand and opened her bag. Searching through it, she found the envelope she wanted. Taking a deep breath, she slowly lifted the seal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特丽莎叹了口气，看了看表。很快就要涨潮了，只有到潮起时她才算最终准备好了。她在一个看似很舒适的小沙丘上找到了一块儿地儿，在沙地上坐了下来，她打开包，在里面找，她找到了她想要的信封。深吸了一口气，她慢慢打开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the bag were other items as well, though she wasn't ready to look at those yet. Instead she continued to focus on the letters. He'd used a fountain pen when he'd written them, and there were smudges in various places where the pen had leaked. The stationery, with its picture of a sailing ship in the upper right hand corner, was beginning to discolor in places, fading slowly with the passage of time. She knew there would come a day when the words would be impossible to read, but hopefully, after today, she wouldn't feel the need to look at them so often.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she finished, she slipped them back into the envelope as carefully as she'd removed them. Then, after putting the envelope back into the bag, she looked at the beach again. From where she was sitting, she could see the place where it had all started.</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd been jogging at daybreak, she remembered, and she could picture that summer morning clearly. It was the beginning of a beautiful day. As she took in the world around her, she listened to the high-pitched squawking of terns and the gentle lapping of the waves as they rolled up on the sand. Even though she was on vacation, she had risen early enough to run so that she didn't have to watch where she was going. In a few hours the beach would be packed with tourists lying on their towels in the hot New England sun, soaking up the rays. Cape Cod was always crowded at that time of year, but most vacationers tended to sleep a little later, and she enjoyed the sensation of jogging on the hard, smooth sand left from the outgoing tide. Unlike the sidewalks back home, the sand seemed to give just enough, and she knew her knees wouldn't ache as they sometimes did after running on cemented pathways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她记得那是拂晓时分，她正在海边慢跑，那个夏天的早晨在她脑海中栩栩如生、清晰如昨。那是美好一天的开始。她细细打量四周，聆听燕鸥高亢的鸣叫和浪涛翻卷到沙滩上轻柔的拍打声。即便是在度假，她每天也起得很早去跑步，这样她就不必在人堆里见缝插针地找路了。再过几小时，海滩上便会人满为患，游客包裹着浴巾，躺在新英格兰炙热的阳光下，享受日光浴。每年的这个时候，科德角湾总是熙熙攘攘，但是大部分游客都喜欢睡懒觉，她喜欢在退去的潮汐留下的坚硬、平滑的沙滩上慢跑。不像自己所在城市的人行道，脚踩在沙地上，沙地轻轻下陷，软硬适宜，她知道自己的膝盖不会像她有时候在水泥地路上跑步时那样疼痛难忍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had always liked to jog, a habit she had picked up from running cross-country and track in high school. Though she wasn't competitive anymore and seldom timed her runs, running was now one of the few times she could be alone with her thoughts. She considered it to be a kind of meditation, which was why she liked to do it alone. She never could understand why people liked to run in groups.</div>

<div class="line_en">As much as she loved her son, she was glad Kevin wasn't with her. Every mother needs a break sometimes, and she was looking forward to taking it easy while she was here. No evening soccer games or swim meets, no MTV blaring in the background, no homework to help with, no waking up in the middle of the night to comfort him when he got leg cramps. She had taken him to the airport three days ago to catch a plane to visit his father-her ex-in California, and it was only after reminding him that Kevin realized he hadn't hugged or kissed her good-bye yet. "Sorry, Mom," he said as he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her. "Love you. Don't miss me too much, okay?" Then, turning around, he handed the ticket to the flight attendant and almost skipped onto the plane without looking back.</div>

Annette, David's new wife, had her hands full with the baby, but Kevin liked her a lot, and he had never returned home feeling angry or neglected. In fact, he usually raved about his visits and how much fun he had. There were times when she felt a twinge of jealousy at that, but she did her best to hide it from Kevin.</div>

Then, of course, Kevin will visit his father on a legal holiday -- six weeks in the summer, Christmas every other year, and Easter school week. Annette -- David's new wife was too busy looking after the new baby to take care of him, but he liked her very much. He never got angry or left home when he came home.

<div class="line_en">The managing editor at the newspaper where Theresa worked, Deanna had been coming to the Cape with her husband, Brian, for years. They always stayed in the same place, the Fisher House, and when she found out that Kevin was leaving to visit his father in California for a good portion of the summer, she insisted that Theresa come along. "Brian golfs every day he's here, and I'd like the company," she'd said, "and besides, what else are you going to do? You've got to get out of that apartment sometime." Theresa knew she was right, and after a few days of thinking it over, she finally agreed. "I'm so glad," Deanna had said with a victorious look on her face. "You're going to love it there."</div>

<div class="line_en">As her breathing eased, she thought about how she would spend the rest of her day. She had brought five books with her for the vacation, books she had been wanting to read for the last year but had never gotten around to. There just didn't seem to be enough time anymore-not with Kevin and his never-ending energy, keeping up with the housework, and definitely not with all the work constantly piled on her desk. As a syndicated columnist for the Boston Times, she was under constant deadline pressure to put out three columns a week. Most of her co-workers thought she had it made-just type up three hundred words and be done for the day-but it wasn't like that at all. To constantly come up with something original regarding parenting wasn't easy anymore-especially if she wanted to syndicate further. Already her column, "Modern Parenting," went out in sixty newspapers across the country, though most ran only one or two of her columns in a given week. And because the syndication offers had started only eighteen months ago and she was a newcomer to most papers, she couldn't afford even a few "off" days. Column space in most newspapers was extremely limited, and hundreds of columnists were vying for those few spots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呼吸平息下来后，她开始想该如何打发这一天的剩余时光。她带了五本书来度假，这些书她去年就想看，但一直没时间。似乎她再也不可能有足够的时间了——没有时间陪凯文和他一起消耗掉他没完没了的精力；没有时间做家务；而且很显然没有时间处理掉她书桌上堆积如山的工作。作为《波士顿时报》的一名专栏作家，她每周要写出三个专栏，一直处于最后期限的压力之下。她的大部分同事以为她的日子过得很清闲——只不过敲出三百字，然后一天的工作就完成了——但实际根本不是那样。要挖空心思不断想出一些有关育儿话题的新鲜爆料不再那么容易了——尤其是如果她想进一步联合专栏的话。她的专栏“现代育儿”已经在全国六十家报刊上发表，尽管大部分报刊只在指定的一周里刊登她的一到两个专栏。因为她才在一年半前得到这个联合专栏的缺，对大部分报刊来讲她是个新手，因此哪怕休几天假对她来说都成了奢望。大部分报刊中的专栏篇幅极其有限，而成百上千个专栏作家都对这为数寥寥的几个豆腐块虎视眈眈。">查看中文翻译</div>

She took a deep breath, held it for a moment, then exhaled before looking out over the water. Because it was early, the ocean was still murky gray, but that would change once the sun rose a little higher. It looked enticing. After a moment she took off her shoes and socks, then walked to the water's edge to let the tiny waves lap over her feet. The water was refreshing, and she spent a few minutes wading back and forth. She was suddenly glad she had taken the time to write extra columns over the last few months so that she would be able to forget work this week. She couldn't remember the last time she didn't have a computer nearby, or a meeting to attend, or a deadline to meet, and it felt liberating to be away from her desk for a while. It almost felt as if she were in control of her own destiny again, as if she were just starting out in the world.</div>

The bathroom should have been wallpapered and updated by now, the nail holes in her walls needed to be spackled, and the rest of the apartment could use some touch-up painting as well. A couple of months ago she had bought the wallpaper and some paint, towel rods and door handles, and a new vanity mirror, as well as all the tools she needed to take care of it, but she hadn't even opened the boxes yet. It was always something to do next weekend, though the weekends were often just as busy as her workdays.

She wanted to be able to sit and talk with Kevin, or play Monopoly with him, or simply watch TV with him without feeling the urge to get up from the couch to do something more important.

<div class="line_en">But how to change all that? "Take life one day at a time," her mother always said, but her mother didn't have to work outside the home or raise a strong and confident yet caring son without benefit of a father. She didn't understand the pressures that Theresa faced on a daily basis. Neither did her younger sister, Janet, who had followed in the footsteps of their mother. She and her husband had been happily married for almost eleven years, with three wonderful girls to show for it. Edward wasn't a brilliant man, but he was honest, worked hard, and provided for his family well enough that Janet didn't have to work. There were times when Theresa thought she might like a life like that, even if it meant giving up her career.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that wasn't possible. Not since David and she divorced. Three years now, four if you counted the year they were separated. She didn't hate David for what he had done, but her respect for him had been shattered. Adultery, whether a one-night stand or a long affair, wasn't something she could live with. Nor did it make her feel better that he never married the woman he'd been carrying on with for two years. The breach of trust was irreparable.</div>

<div class="line_en">David moved back to his home state of California a year after they separated and met Annette a few months later. His new wife was very religious, and little by little she got David interested in the church. David, a lifelong agnostic, had always seemed to be hungry for something more meaningful in his life. Now he attended church regularly and actually served as a marriage counselor along with the pastor. What could he possibly say to someone doing the same things he'd done, she often wondered, and how could he help others if he hadn't been able to control himself? She didn't know, didn't care, really. She was simply glad that he still took an interest in his son.</div>

<div class="line_en">Naturally, once she and David had split up, a lot of her friendships ended as well. Now that she was no longer part of a couple, she seemed to be out of place at friends' Christmas parties or backyard barbecues. A few friends remained, though, and she heard from them on her answering machine, suggesting that they set up a lunch date or come over for dinner. Occasionally she would go, but usually she made excuses not to. To her, none of those friendships seemed the way they used to, but then of course they weren't. Things changed, people changed, and world went rolling along right outside the window.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since the divorce there had been only a handful of dates. It wasn't that she was unattractive. She was, or so she was often told. Her hair was dark brown, cut just above her shoulders, and straight as spider silk. Her eyes, the feature she was most often complimented on, were brown with flecks of hazel that caught the light when she was outside. Since she ran daily, she was fit and didn't look as old as she was. She didn't feel old, either, but when she looked in the mirror lately, she seemed to see her age catching up with her. A new wrinkle around the corner of her eye, a gray hair that seemed to have grown overnight, a vaguely weary look from being constantly on the run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从离婚后她就只约会过几次。并不是因为她不迷人。她风韵犹存，至少人们经常这么告诉她。她头发深棕色，刚好及肩，如蛛丝般笔直柔顺。她的眼睛经常受人赞美，棕色，当在户外照到阳光时便闪耀着棕红的光芒。因为她每天跑步，因此看起来很健康，也没有实际那么老。她也并不感觉自己老。但是最近她照镜子，似乎看到自己被真实年龄赶上了。眼角出现了一条新皱纹，头上冒出一根灰发，似乎是一夜之间长出来的，因为总是劳碌奔波，脸上神情憔悴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her friends thought she was crazy. "You look better now than you did years ago," they insisted, and she still noticed a few men eyeing her across the aisle in the supermarket. But she wasn't, nor ever would be, twenty-two again. Not that she would want to be, even if she could, unless, she sometimes thought to herself, she could take her more mature brain back with her. If she didn't, she'd probably get caught up with another David-a handsome man who craved the good things in life with the underlying assumption that he didn't have to play by the rules. But dammit, rules were important, especially the ones regarding marriage. They were the ones a person was never supposed to break. Her father and mother didn't break them, her sister and brother-in-law didn't, nor did Deanna and Brian. Why did he have to? And why, she wondered as she stood in the surf, did her thoughts always come back to this, even after all this time?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她的朋友认为不可思议。“你比几年前看起来更漂亮了。”他们坚持说。在超市购物，她时不时还能注意到几个男人在过道里偷偷打量自己。但是她不想，也再也不会回到二十二岁了。即使她能她也不想，除非，有时候她暗自想，她能将自己更成熟的头脑一并带回去。如果她不能，那么也许她又会被另一个戴维迷得七荤八素——一个英俊的男人，渴望生命中美好的东西，自以为他不必按规矩来玩这场游戏。但是，该死的，规矩很重要，尤其是婚姻规则。人们以为他们绝不会违反婚姻规则。她的父母没有违反，她的妹妹和妹夫没有，迪安娜和布莱恩也没有。为什么他要？又为什么，她站在浪花中想，为什么她的思绪最终总是会回到这件事上？为什么过去了这么久她还是不依不饶？">查看中文翻译</div>

That initial anger she felt had turned to sadness, and now it had become something else, almost a dullness of sorts. Even though she was constantly in motion, it seemed as if nothing special ever happened to her anymore. Each day seemed exactly like the last, and she had trouble differentiating among them. One time, about a year ago, she sat at her desk for fifteen minutes trying to remember the last spontaneous thing she'd done. She couldn't think of anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, with three years gone by, she honestly didn't know if she would ever love someone again the way she had loved David. When David showed up at her sorority party at the beginning of her junior year, one look was all it took for her to know she wanted to be with him. Her young love had seemed so overwhelming, so powerful, then. She would stay awake thinking about him as she lay in her bed, and when she walked across campus, she smiled so often that other people would smile back whenever they saw her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The unfair thing about the whole situation was that she still missed him sometimes, or rather the good parts about him. Being married to David was comfortable, like a bed she'd slept in for years. She had been used to having another person around, just to talk to or listen.

Kevin always looked so peaceful, so beautiful, with his head on the pillow and the covers piled up around him. In the daytime he seemed to be constantly on the go, but at night his still, sleeping figure always brought back the feelings she'd had when he was still a baby.

<div class="line_en">She still dreamed about falling in love with someone, of having someone take her in his arms and make her feel she was the only one who mattered. But it was hard, if not impossible, to meet someone decent these days. Most of the men she knew in their thirties were already married, and the ones that were divorced seemed to be looking for someone younger whom they could somehow mold into exactly what they wanted. That left older men, and even though she thought she could fall in love with someone older, she had her son to worry about. She wanted a man who would treat Kevin the way he should be treated, not simply as the unwanted by-product of someone he desired. But the reality was that older men usually had older children; few welcomed the trials of raising an adolescent male in the 1990s. "I've already done my job," a date had once informed her curtly. That had been the end of that relationship.</div>

She hadn't been raised that way and didn't intend to change now. Sex was too important, too special, to be shared with just anyone. In fact, she had slept with only two men in her life-David, of course, and Chris, the first real boyfriend she'd ever had.

When nothing ever came, disappointment set in, the memory fading gradually until it became nothing at all. But now it all came back to her. Who had been with her that day? A girl about her age...

<div class="line_en">She caught herself holding her breath. Maybe it was old. It could be-there were stories about bottles washing up after a hundred years at sea, so that could be the case now. Maybe she had a real artifact here. But as she scrutinized the writing itself, she saw that she was mistaken. There was a date on the upper left corner of the paper.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked a little further. The message was long-it covered the front and back sides of the paper-and it didn't seem to request any reply of sorts. A quick glance showed no address or phone number anywhere, but she supposed it could have been written into the letter itself.</div>

<div class="line_en">I miss you, my darling, as I always do, but today is especially hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together. I can almost feel you beside me as I write this letter, and I can smell the scent of wildflowers that always reminds me of you. But at this moment, these things give me no pleasure. Your visits have been coming less often, and I feel sometimes as if the greatest part of who I am is slowly slipping away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲爱的，我一如既往地想你，但是今天想得尤其难受，因为大海在对我歌唱，唱着我们一起生活的歌。当我写这封信时你仿佛就在我身边，我能闻到野花的香气，它总是让我想起你。但在此刻，这些美好的东西没有给我带来快乐。你来看我的次数越来越少了，有时候我甚至觉得我身体里最重要的灵魂都已经慢慢远离我了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am trying, though. At night when I am alone, I call for you, and whenever my ache seems to be the greatest, you still seem to find a way to return to me. Last night, in my dreams, I saw you on the pier near Wrightsville Beach. The wind was blowing through your hair, and your eyes held the fading sunlight. I am struck as I see you leaning against the rail. You are beautiful, I think as I see you, a vision that I can never find in anyone else. I slowly begin to walk toward you, and when you finally turn to me, I notice that others have been watching you as well. "Do you know her?" they ask me in jealous whispers, and as you smile at me, I simply answer with the truth. "Better than my own heart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直在思念你。夜深人静、孤枕难眠时，我呼唤你，每当我的痛苦到达顶点时，你似乎总能找到一种方式回到我身边。昨晚，在我的梦中，我看到你站在赖茨维尔海滩附近的码头上。风吹过你的秀发，夕阳的余辉在你的双眸中流转。当我看见你倚靠在栏杆上时被深深震住了。你好美，我怔怔凝望着你，心里想，我在任何其他人身上再也看不到那样震慑人心的美了。我开始慢慢朝你走去。当你终于转身面向我时，我注意到其他人也在注视着你。“你认识她吗？”你冲我嫣然一笑时他们用嫉妒的语气小声问我，我只能如实相告：“比我自己的心更了解。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But then, as always, the mist starts to form as we stand close to one another. It is a distant fog that rises from the horizon, and I find that I grow fearful as it approaches. It slowly creeps in, enveloping the world around us, fencing us in as if to prevent escape. Like a rolling cloud, it blankets everything, closing, until there is nothing left but the two of us.</div>

And then you spread your arms and step back into the fog because it is your place and not mine. I long to go with you, but your only response is to shake your head because we both know that is impossible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始感到喉咙哽咽，我的眼里蓄满了泪水，因为我知道你该走了。那一刻你看我的眼神萦绕在我心头，挥之不去。我感受到了你的悲伤和自己的孤独，我心中锥心的痛，它只平息了片刻，当你离去时变得更强烈了，让我痛彻心扉。这时你张开双臂，走进了雾中，因为那是你的归属，而不是我的。我多想和你一起走，但是你只是无奈地摇了摇头，因为我们都知道这不可能。">查看中文翻译</div>
