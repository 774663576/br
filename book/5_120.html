<div class="line_en">The couple that walked through her door on that icy November morning bore only the most surface resemblance to the people who'd been on her first live show. Mr. McAdams had lost at least twenty pounds and no longer walked hunched over, with his head pulled down into his shoulders. Mrs. McAdams had cut her hair, put on makeup, and was smiling. "Wow," Tully said, "you two look great. Please, sit down."</div>

<div class="line_en">The front yard had a wild, untended look about it, as if long ago a young mother had spent her spring months outside, planting bulbs and perennials, with her babies in blankets on the grass around her, and over the years, as those kids had grown up and chosen their own summer pursuits, the time for gardening had been lost. All those plants still thrived in the short, hot blast of a Northwest summer, though, returning year after year as reminders of an earlier time, growing up and out and into one another, just like the family that lived in the house. Now, in the midst of a cold, gray November's day, every plant looked leggy and brown. Leaves lay strewn everywhere, multicolored splashes hung on dying roses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前院有种荒芜蔓生的气氛，仿佛多年前有个年轻妈妈在春季时辛勤整理，种下球茎与多年生植物，裹着毯子的宝宝乖乖躺在草地上；随着光阴流逝，孩子长大了，暑假一到便各自去忙自己的事情，花园中的幸福时光一去不复返。不过那些植物依旧生机蓬勃，在西北岸短暂酷热的夏季中成长得茁壮，年复一年绽放，有如过往所留下的纪念品，往上抽高，往外发展，入侵彼此的地盘，一如屋里住的那家人。在这个阴冷灰暗的十一月早晨，所有植物都只剩下枯枝，一片棕黄，落叶四散，五彩缤纷点缀着垂死的玫瑰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By nine A. M., she had everything set up. Packing quickly, she threw what she needed in her car and drove to a store on Capitol Hill for a few supplies, then continued to the ferry. The wait on shore and then the crossing seemed to take forever, but eventually she drove into Kate's driveway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上九点，她的计谋已经安排妥当了。她迅速收拾行李，将需要用到的东西扔进车上，然后开车前往首都丘采购道具，最后搭上渡轮。等船加上渡海的时间，感觉仿佛永无止境，不过她还是顺利抵达凯蒂家门前的车道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully parked her Mercedes in front of the garage and got out. As she picked her way through the bikes and skateboards and action figures strewn across the gravel path, she couldn't help admiring how homey this place was, even at this time of year. The shingled house, built in the twenties for a wealthy lumber baron's weekends, wore a new, crisp coat of caramel-hued stain; bright glossy white trim outlined the mullioned windows, beneath which were flower boxes filled with the last blooming geraniums of the season.</div>
