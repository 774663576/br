<div class="line_en">The night was such a fine one that I had preferred to come on foot. I stepped into the big square hall and Parker relieved me of my overcoat. Just then Ackroyd's secretary, a pleasant young fellow by the name of Raymond, passed through the hall on his way to Ackroyd's study, his hands full of papers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜色宜人，所以我步行前来。刚踏进宽敞的方形前厅，帕克就上前帮我脱下大衣。此时艾克罗伊德的秘书雷蒙德——一个讨人喜欢的年轻人——正好穿过前厅去艾克罗伊德的书房，手里捧着一大摞文件。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I explained that I expected a summons to a confinement case at any moment, and so had come out prepared for an emergency call. Raymond nodded, and went on his way, calling over his shoulder:</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first time I found myself appraising the housekeeper and thinking what a handsome woman she must once have been -- indeed, as far as that goes, still was. Her dark hair was unstreaked with grey, and when she had a colour, as she had at this minute, the stern quality of her looks was not so apparent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我头一次暗暗品评这位女管家，心想她年轻时一定相当漂亮——其实现在也还很漂亮。她满头黑发，不夹杂一根银丝；而且当她飞红了脸的时候，就像现在这样，那冰霜般的严厉神色也就不那么扎眼了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I noticed, just as I was turning the handle, a sound from within -- the shutting down of a window, I took it to be. I noticed it, I may say, quite mechanically, without attaching any importance to it at the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正要扭动门把，却听见屋里传出一阵响动——似乎是关窗子的声音。我注意到这一点完全是出于条件反射，当时我丝毫没察觉其中的重要意义。">查看中文翻译</div>

As I did so, I saw what, of course, I might have known all the time had I troubled to give my mind to it, namely, that the windows were long french ones opening on the terrace. The sound I had heard, therefore, could not have been that of a window being shut down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她匆匆离开房间。我踱到窗边，寻思着她为何急于找个借口来解释自己在客厅出现的原因。随即我发现落地窗是朝向露台开着的，如果之前稍加留心就会注意到。这么看来，刚才的响声显然就不可能是关窗子了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quite idly, and more to distract my mind from painful thoughts than for any other reason, I amused myself by trying to guess what could have caused the sound in question.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then my eye was caught by what, I believe, is called a silver table, the lid of which lifts, and through the glass of which you can see the contents. I crossed over to it, studying the contents. There were one or two pieces of old silver, a baby shoe belonging to King Charles the First, some Chinese jade figures, and quite a number of African implements and curios. Wanting to examine one of the jade figures more closely, I lifted the lid. It slipped through my fingers and fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时一件家具吸引了我的目光，他们管这东西叫银桌。桌面的盖子可以向上敞开，透过玻璃可以看见里面存放的物件。我走到桌旁细细查看，只见其中放了一两件旧银器、一只查理一世穿过的婴儿鞋、几件产自中国的翡翠雕像，还有好些来自非洲的器物古玩。为了更仔细地赏玩一尊翡翠雕像，我掀开桌盖，一不留神它却从指间滑落下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Quite a lot of people do not like Flora Ackroyd, but nobody can help admiring her. And to her friends she can be very charming. The first thing that strikes you about her is her extraordinary fairness. She has the real Scandinavian pale gold hair. Her eyes are blue -- blue as the waters of a Norwegian fiord, and her skin is cream and roses. She has square, boyish shoulders and slight hips. And to a jaded medical man it is very refreshing to come across such perfect health.</div>

<div class="line_en">His friendship with Ackroyd has always puzzled me a little. The two men are so totally dissimilar. Hector Blunt is perhaps five years Ackroyd's junior. They made friends early in life, and though their ways have diverged, the friendship still holds. About once in two years Blunt spends a fortnight at Fernly, and an immense animal's head, with an amazing number of horns which fixes you with a glazed stare as soon as you come inside the front door, is a permanent reminder of the friendship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和艾克罗伊德之间的友情始终令我不解。这两人个性迥异，赫克托·布兰特比艾克罗伊德年轻五岁左右，两人早年间就已结为好友，虽然后来各奔前程，友谊却从来不曾消减分毫。差不多每隔两年，布兰特就会来芬利庄园住上两星期。每当你踏入庄园大宅前门，就会迎面看到一只虎视眈眈的巨大兽头，四周还环绕着数目惊人的犀牛角，那是他们友情的永恒见证。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A lot of people know Hector Blunt -- at least by repute. He has shot more wild animals in unlikely places than any man living, I suppose. When you mention him, people say: "Blunt -- you don't mean the big game man, do you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Ackroyd's eloquence was cut short as the drawing-room door opened once more. I was pleased at the interruption.

His face is almost mahogany coloured, and is peculiarly expressionless. He has grey eyes that give the impression of always watching something that is happening very far away. He talks little, and what he does say is said jerkily, as though the words were forced out of him unwillingly.</div>

I knew there was a new sweet pea because the Daily Mail had told me so that morning. Mrs Ackroyd knows nothing about horticulture, but she is the kind of woman who likes to appear well-informed about the topics of the day, and she, too, reads the Daily Mail. We were able to converse quite intelligently until Ackroyd and his secretary joined us, and immediately afterwards Parker announced dinner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dinner was not a cheerful affair. Ackroyd was visibly preoccupied. He looked wretched, and ate next to nothing. Mrs Ackroyd, Raymond, and I kept the conversation going. Flora seemed affected by her uncle's depression, and Blunt relapsed into his usual taciturnity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚宴的气氛并不欢快，艾克罗伊德明显心事重重，形容憔悴，几乎什么都没吃。艾克罗伊德太太、雷蒙德和我三人好歹还维持着谈话氛围；弗洛拉似乎受到伯父的感染，情绪也很低落；布兰特则一如既往地沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The study was a comfortable apartment. Bookshelves lined one wall of it. The chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather. A large desk stood by the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and filed. On a round table were various magazines and sporting papers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="书房里的环境十分舒适：占据整面墙的书架、宽大的深蓝色皮椅；窗前有张大书桌，桌面上整整齐齐摞着分类归档的文件，另外一张圆桌上放着各种杂志和体育报纸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I studied him quietly without appearing to do so. He was clearly under the influence of some strong excitement. For a minute or two he paced up and down the room, then, as Parker entered with the coffee tray, he sank into an armchair in front of the fire.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我等了一阵，然后他又接着说道：“你要知道，谢泼德，我是偷偷告诉你这个秘密的。我不打算采取任何行动，我想先听听你的意见——这千斤重担我一人可挑不起来。刚才说过，我完全不知该怎么办。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's like this. Three months ago I asked Mrs Ferrars to marry me. She refused. I asked her again and she consented, but she refused to allow me to make the engagement public until her year of mourning was up. Yesterday I called upon her, pointed out that a year and three weeks had now elapsed since her husband's death, and that there could be no further objection to making the engagement public property. I had noticed that she had been very strange in her manner for some days. Now, suddenly, without the least warning, she broke down completely. She -- she told me everything. Her hatred of her brute of a husband, her growing love for me, and the -- the dreadful means she had taken. Poison! My God! It was murder in cold blood."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是这样，三个月前我向弗拉尔斯太太求婚，她拒绝了。后来我再三请求，她总算答应，但却要求我严密封锁订婚的消息，直到她服丧满一年为止。昨天我登门拜访，提醒说她丈夫去世已经一年又三个星期了，我们公开订婚的消息应该不存在障碍才对。之前一段时间以来，我已察觉她的举止相当怪异，然后她突然毫无征兆地彻底崩溃，她——她把一切都抖搂出来了。她恨透了畜生一样的丈夫，渐渐爱上了我，于是——于是就铤而走险，采用了最可怕的手段。毒药！我的天，这是冷血的谋杀啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw the repulsion, the horror, in Ackroyd's face. So Mrs Ferrars must have seen it. Ackroyd's is not the type of the great lover who can forgive all for love's sake. He is fundamentally a good citizen. All that was sound and wholesome and law-abiding in him must have turned from her utterly in that moment of revelation.</div>

She had made me, you see, an accessory after the fact. She saw all that, I think, quicker than I did. I was stunned, you know. She asked me for twenty-four hours -- made me promise to do nothing till the end of that time. And she steadfastly refused to give me the name of the scoundrel who had been blackmailing her. I suppose she was afraid that I might go straight off and hammer him, and then the fat would have been in the fire as far as she was concerned.
