<div class="line_en">"He left!" said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. "Left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom! I told him I'd flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It's just lucky I put Mr. Tibbles on the case! But we haven't got time to stand around! Hurry, now, we've got to get you back! Oh, the trouble this is going to cause! I will kill him!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll do it." Harry took hold of Dudley's arm and heaved. With an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet. Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting. His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来吧。”哈利抓住达力的胳膊用力拽着。他费了九牛二虎之力，总算把达力拖得站了起来。达力似乎随时都会昏倒，他的小眼睛在眼窝里转来转去，脸上沁出粒粒汗珠。哈利刚松开手，他就摇晃起来，好像要摔倒的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Keep your wand out," she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria Walk. "Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there's going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg.

Oh, it's just Mr. Prentice… Don't put your wand away, boy, don't I keep telling you I'm no use?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把你的魔杖拿在外面，”他们走进紫藤路时，她对哈利说，“现在别管什么《保密法》啦，反正是免不了受罚，为一条龙是一死，为一个蛋也是一死。说到《对未成年巫师加以合理约束法》——这正是邓布利多一直担心的——路口那儿是什么？噢，是普伦提斯先生…别把魔杖收起来，孩子，我不是一直跟你说吗，我是不管用的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry pulled one of Dudley's massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road, sagging slightly under the weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously around the corner.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你以前为什么没有告诉我你是个哑炮，费格太太？”哈利问，他不敢停脚，累得气喘吁吁。“我那么多次到你家去——你为什么一字不提呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dumbledore's orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. I'm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, Harry, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it. It wasn't easy, you know… but oh my word," she said tragically, wringing her hands once more, "when Dumbledore hears about this -- how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be on duty until midnight -- where is he? How am I going to tell Dumbledore what's happened? I can't Apparate --"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul Dudley along at the same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He was slumped on Harry's shoulder, his large feet dragging along the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既要稳稳地举着魔杖，同时又要拖着达力往前走，这真不是一件容易的事。哈利不耐烦地捅了捅表哥的肋骨，可是达力似乎完全丧失了自己行动的愿望。他瘫倒在哈利的肩膀上，两只大脚拖在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them. He had short, bandy legs, long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound. He was also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognised at once as an Invisibility Cloak.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“回来了？”佩妮姨妈压低声音问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother's sister. He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sisters) were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful. The furious pretence that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry's life -- that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon -- seemed to have fallen away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她望着哈利，那目光是以前从未有过的。突然之问，哈利有生以来第一次充分意识到佩妮姨妈是他妈妈的姐姐。他说不出来为什么此刻这样强烈地感受到了这一点。他只知道，这个屋子里不止他一个人模糊地意识到伏地魔的复出意味着什么。佩妮姨妈这辈子从未用这种目光看过他。她那双浅色的大眼睛（与她妹妹的眼睛如此不同）不再因厌恶和愤怒而眯起，而是睁得大大的，充满恐惧。哈利有生以来一直看着佩妮姨妈在很激烈地维护一种假相——魔法根本不存在，除了她和弗农姨父共同生活的这个世界，根本不存在另一个世界——而现在这种假相似乎消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight back up the chimney.</div>
