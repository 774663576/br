<div class="line_en">The mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.</div>

<div class="line_en">The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract -- Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherché movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果精通数学，这种解决疑难的才能或许格外高强，最好是精通那种高等教学，即所谓解析，称为解析似乎是最理想了，其实不然，只是因为它运用逆算法，才称为解析。可是计算本来并不等于分析。比方说，下象棋的，并不在分析上下功夫，只在计算上费心机。因此，一般以为下象棋有益身心的说法是不对的。我目前并没有在写论文，只不过在一篇多少有点离奇的故事前面，先写下一段杂乱无章的意见作为开场白而已；我要趁机声明一下，较高的思考能力用在看不出什么花样的跳棋上，比用在苦心推敲的象棋上，更显得见效，更显得有用。象棋这门玩艺，各子都有各子的希奇古怪走法，都有变化无常的妙用。象棋不过复杂罢了，却往做被人错当做深奥。下象棋务须聚精会神，如果稍有松懈，疏忽一步，势必损兵折将，败下阵来。象棋的走法，不仅五花八门，而且错综复杂，这种疏忽的可能性也就增多；十回倒有九回，赢家总是精神集中的棋手，不是比较聪明的棋手。相反的，跳棋这门游戏，走法死板，绝少变化，疏漏的可能性少得多，因此相形之下，他用不着全神贯注，双方棋手相遇，只要聪明一点的就包管不会输。说得比较具体一点，不妨假定有一局跳棋．大家只剩下四个王棋，当然没什么疏忽之虞了。这样，如果双方旗鼓相当的话，分明只有善于动脑筋，棋法步步推敲，才能取胜。有分析力的人碰到毫无对策的情况，总是专心研究对方的思想，设身处地的去揣摩一番，这样常常能一眼看出唯一的招数，有时这招数实在简单得可笑；但诱使对方铸成错误、忙中失算，就凭这一招。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by "the book," are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit. He recognises what is played through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation -- all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="惠斯特牌戏素来以能养成所谓计算能力闻名。大家知道，凡是智力出众的人，显然沉湎此道，感到其乐无穷，而不愿下象棋，认为无聊。不用说，绝对找不出第二种同样性质的玩艺需要这样大大发挥分析能力的。世上象棋下得出色的人，至多只是在象棋方面有专长罢了；可是精通惠斯特，就能在一切比较重大的勾心斗角的场合取胜。我说精通，就是说熟谙这门玩艺，包括通晓一切取得合法优势的窍门。这种窍门不单是五花八门，也是多种多样，而且往往就在心灵深处，一般人根本无从了解。留神观察的，记忆力必定强；因之专心一意下象棋的人，玩起惠斯特准会非常出色；而且霍伊尔牌戏谱中的规则（根据纯粹的牌戏技巧制定的）通俗易懂。通常人们认为精于此道的，必须具有两个条件，一是过目不忘，二是根据“本本”行事。不过碰到规则范围里没有的情况，倒恰恰看得出具有分析力的人的牌技。他悄悄作了不少观察和推论。说不定他的牌友也在这么做；双方对敌情了解的深浅之分，与其说决定于推论的正误，还不如说决定于观察能力的高低。必需掌握如何观察这门学问。玩牌的人决不是只顾自己打牌，也不是因为只求赢牌，就不分神推断局外的事。他打量搭档的脸色，仔细跟对手的脸色—一比较。他估计每个人执牌的顺序，还根据分到王牌和大牌的人种种不同的眼色，算计一张张王牌和一张张大牌。一面打牌，一面鉴貌辨色，看人家是自信呢还是惊讶，是得意呢还是懊恼。从种种不同的表情中，收集思考的资料，根据对方把赢得的一墩牌收起来的神态，揣测赢了这一墩牌的人能不能再赢一墩同花牌。根据对方摊牌的神情，认出人家是声东击西，掩人耳目。凡是对方随便提到一个字，脱口说出一句话，偶然掉下一张牌，不巧翻开一张牌，赶紧掩饰时那副焦急不安或漫不经心的神情；计算赢了几墩牌，这几墩牌的布局，人家是窘迫呢还是犹豫，是焦急呢还是惶恐——凡此种种，都逃不过他那类似直觉的观察，向他提供了情况真相的蛛丝马迹。打了两三圈牌，他就充分掌握各家手里有些什么牌了，从此以后，就胸有成竹，每副牌都打得准，仿佛同局各家手里的牌都排在桌面上似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18—, I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young gentleman was of an excellent -- indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一八XX年，春夏期间，我寓居巴黎；在当地结识了一位名叫西·奥古斯特·杜宾的法国少爷。这位公子哥儿出身富贵——确实是名门子弟，不料命途多外，就此沦为贫困，以致意志消沉，不思发奋图强，也无意重整家业。多亏债主留情，他才照旧承袭祖上一点薄产。靠此出息，他精打细算，好容易方维持温饱，倒也别无奢求。说真的，看书是他唯一的享受，何况在巴黎，要看书是再方便也没有了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="分析能力决不能跟单纯的足智多谋混为一谈；因为善于分析的人势必足智多媒，可是足智多媒的人往往格外不善分析。足智多谋通常从推定能力或归纳能力中表现出来，骨相学家把推定能力和归纳能力归诸于一种独立的器官，认为这是原始的能力，据我看来这是根本错误的；智力完全与白痴无异的人身上往往看得出这种原始能力，因此引起了心理学作者的普遍注意。足智多谋和分析能力之间的差别，固然比幻想和想象的差别还要大，不过两者的性质，显然非常相似。实际上不难看出，聪明人往往善于幻想，而真正富于想象的人必定爱好分析。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other again and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination. Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the massy shutters of our old building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams -- reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.</div>

<div class="line_en">At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise -- if not exactly in its display -- and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin -- the creative and the resolvent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管我早就从杜宾那丰富的想象力里看出他具有特殊的分析能力，可是在这种时候。我对他的分析能力还是不由得另眼相看，心悦诚服。看他模样仿佛也巴不得漏一手玩玩——如果不全是卖弄的话——他毫不含糊地老实承认其中自有乐趣。他轻声嘻嘻笑着，对我吹嘘说，大多数人跟他比起来，都是玻璃心肝，一看就透，他对我的心思真是了如指掌，常常当场拿出这种惊人的根据，证明他说的一点不假。这时刻他的态度冷漠，茫然若失，眼神毫无表情；他的嗓子素来是洪亮的男高音，竟提到了最高音，要不是发音有条不紊，咬字一清二楚，听起来真当他在发火呢。眼看他这么副心情，我不由时常默想着有关双重的心的古老学说，心里不断玩味着兼具丰富想象力和解决能力的杜宾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:</div>

<div class="line_en">"We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C --—. This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.</div>

The larger links of the chain run thus -- Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer."</div>

Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomy,' a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday's 'Musée,' the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed.

<div class="line_en">I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler's immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow -- that Chantilly -- he would do better at the Théâtre des Variétés."</div>

<div class="line_en">"EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS. -- This morning, about three o'clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame L'Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille L'Espanaye. After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two gendarmes. By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices, in angry contention, were distinguished, and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased, and everything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves, and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of Madame L'Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The apartment was in the wildest disorder -- the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller ofmétal d'Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.</div>

Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet -- not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom nor top. The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced -- and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony -- were loud and drawn out, not short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention -- the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller -- a very strange voice. Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was positive that it was not a woman's voice. Could distinguish the words 'sacré' and 'diable.' The shrill voice was that of a foreigner. Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish.

<div class="line_en">"Paul Dumas, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances. The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron -- a chair -- any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument -- probably with a razor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We must not judge of the means," said Dupin, "by this shell of an examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain's calling for his robe-de-chambre -- pour mieux entendre la musique. The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man. But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always in a well. In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances -- to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly -- is to have the best appreciation of its lustre -- a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们可千万不能光凭一项传讯结果来看待什么破案法子。”杜宾道。“巴黎警察一向以聪明称道于世，其实不过狡猾罢了。他们办起案来，只有目前采用的这种方法。尽管夸口有一大套办法，可是经常用得驴唇不对马嘴，不由叫人想起茹尔丹先生要拿睡衣，以便更舒服地欣赏音乐。他们办案的成绩虽然经常有惊人之笔，可这多半是单靠卖力巴结。碰到这些长处起不了作用，计划就落了空。比方说，维多克（法国名侦探）善于推测，做起事来总是百折不挠。不过，思想没有受过熏陶，侦查时往往过于专心，反而一错再错。他看东西隔得太近，反而歪曲事物真相。说不定，有一两点地看得特别清楚，可是这样，势必看不清问题的全面。有种事就此显得非常奥妙。事实真相不会永远在井底。其实，我倒认为，真正比较重要的知识必定肤浅。事实真相并不在我们钻的牛角尖里，而是在抬眼就望得见的地方。这种错误的方式和根源，可以用观察天体来说明。你晃眼看下星星——只消斜眼瞟一瞟，将视网膜的外部对准星星，就可以把星星看得一清二楚，也可以对星光有个最正确的估计，视网膜的外部对微弱光亮的感光力比内部强，因此视线全部集中在星星上，星光反而随之微弱。视线全部集中在星星上，绝大部分星光实际上就照在眼睛上，可是斜眼一瞟的话，反而能看得更正确。过于认为奥妙，思想反而模糊不清；如果紧紧盯着苍穹，过于持久，过于集中，过于直接，那么连金星也会黯然无光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue. This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge. Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building -- Dupin, meanwhile, examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.</div>

We went up stairs -- into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the "Gazette des Tribunaux." Dupin scrutinized every thing -- not excepting the bodies of the victims.

<div class="line_en">"The 'Gazette,' " he replied, "has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution -- I mean for the outré character of its features. The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive -- not for the murder itself -- but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before.' In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“报上恐怕并没涉及本案那种惨绝人寰的恐怖性。”他答道。“不过，别去管那张报纸的无稽之谈吧。我看，这件疑案大家认为破不了，其理由倒应该看成容易破案——我说的是本案的特点中那种超越常轨的性质。由于表面上找不到动机——不是杀人的动机——而是杀人手段这么毒辣的动机，警察局竟弄得一筹莫展。楼上只有被害的列士巴奈小姐，并没旁人，再说没有一条出路逃得过上楼那伙人的眼睛，这而件事眼明明听到了争吵声音，表面上看来完全矛盾，这点警察局也弄得莫名其妙。房里乱七八糟，死尸倒塞进烟囱里；老太太的尸首残缺不全，惨不忍睹；官府办案的碰到这些情形，加上刚才提到过的原因，以及种种不必多提的情形，他们吹嘘的聪明自然施展不出，无能为力。他们犯了个大错误，可这倒也寻常，他们把难得看见的事错当做奥妙透项的事了。不过，如果要探求事实真相，只须打破常规，就可以摸索出一条道理来。象咱们目前进行的查访工作，与其问‘出了什么事’，还不如问‘出了什么从没出过的事’。老实说，这件疑案，我一下子就能解决，或者说，已经解决了，我看作容易，警察看作破不了，这恰恰成为正比。”">查看中文翻译</div>

This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction.

<div class="line_en">"That was the evidence itself," said Dupin, "but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet there was something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is -- not that they disagreed -- but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen. Each likens it -- not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant -- but the converse. The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.' The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that 'not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.' The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and 'does not understand German.' The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was that of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, 'as he has no knowledge of the English.' The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but 'has never conversed with a native of Russia.' A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by the intonation.' Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited! -- in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic -- of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points.

<div class="line_en">"Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events. Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how? Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision. -- Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction. No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance. But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then, no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent 'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在咱们就算到那间寝室去了吧。先找什么呢？凶手逃走的方法。咱们俩谁都不信不可思议的怪事，这是不消说的。列士巴奈太太母女俩不会给妖怪杀害。行凶的是个有血有肉的，逃走时也不能化为一缕轻烟。那么怎么逃的呢？幸亏这问题只有一种推论的方式，靠了这方式一定能得到个明确的判断。咱们把凶手可能采取的逃走方法，一一加以研究吧。大伙上楼的当儿，凶手明明就在发现列士巴奈小姐尸体的房里，至少可以说是在隔壁房里。因此只要在这两间房里找出口就行了。警察已经把四处地板、天花板和砖墙全都查看得一清二楚。没什么秘密出口逃得过他们的法眼。可是，我信不过他们的眼力，亲自查了一下。查过了，果然没有秘密出口。通过道的两扇房门全都锁得严严密密，钥匙也都插在里面。回头去看看烟囱吧。这些烟囱虽然都跟普通烟囱一样宽，离开炉边有八九尺高，可是从头到尾连只大猫的身子都容不下。以上说的两个地方，既然都绝对不可能作为逃走的出路，那就只好从窗子着手了。打前房窗口逃走，那可逃不过街上一伙人的眼睛。因此，凶手一定是从后房窗口逃跑的。好了，既然得出了这么明显的结论，那么，作为推论的人，就不能因为看来不通而予以否定。咱们只有去证明这些看来‘不通’的理由实际上是通的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know not," continued Dupin, "what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony -- the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices -- are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said 'legitimate deductions;' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result. What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form -- a certain tendency -- to my inquiries in the chamber.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I proceeded to think thus -- à posteriori. The murderers did escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened; -- the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes were fastened. They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我就这样着手琢磨了——从结果推溯原因。凶手准是从这两扇窗子的一扇逃走的。就算这样，凶手出去了可没法再从里边挂上窗框，要知道大家看见的窗框就是拴着的——这事非常明显，警察才不在这方面追根究底。可是窗框是拴紧的。那么，一定能够自动拴上。这个结论绝对错不了，我走到那个没堵上的窗口，花了番手脚才拔去钉子，打算把窗框推上。不出我所料，果然是怎么推都推不上。我这才知道，准是暗装一道弹簧；我的想法证实了。就此相信不管这钉子的情况看来依然多么玄妙，我的前提至少是对的。仔细找了一下，马上就找出这个机关来了。我一按，心里对这个发现挺满意，就忍住了，没去推上窗框。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within. It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught -- but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The assassins must have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner -- driven in nearly up to the head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当下重新放好钉子，留神打量一通。一个人跳出这个窗子，窗子会重新关上，弹簧也会碰上；可是钉子不会重新钉好。这个结论很清楚，我的侦查范围就此缩小了。凶手一定从另一个窗子逃走。两个窗子的弹簧大概是相同的，假定这样的话，钉子上一定有个不同的地方，至少钉法上不同。踏上床架的棚子，我探出头，仔细朝床头后面另一个窗子端详一番。伸手到床头后面一摸，一下子就摸到弹簧，一按，果真不出所料，就跟那扇窗子一模一样。于是看看钉子。正跟另一枚钉子一样结实，而且分明是一样钉法，也快钉到了头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.' The scent had never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result, -- and that result was the nail. It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew. 'There must be something wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.' I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete -- the fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你会说我给难住了；真这样想的话，一定是弄错了归纳法的道理。套句运动界的行活，我可是‘百发百中’。线索始终没断过。任何一个环节都没脱掉。我已经追到这个秘密的底了；那个底就是钉子。我刚说，外表上看来，这钉子跟另一扇窗子上的钉子丝毫不差；尽管看起来这是真凭实据，可是眼看线索马上就要解开，比起来，这凭据根本毫无价值了。我说；‘这钉子一定有什么不对头的地方。’伸手一摸，手指头就箝出了钉头，外加二三分长的钉身。钉身的其他部分还在钉眼里，就是在那儿断掉的。断口是老的，因为边上全生了锈，分明是锤子捶断的，一捶就将钉头多少捶进下边窗框的顶上。当下我就把针头重新放在刚才取出的缺口里，果然活象一枚钉子——一点缝都看不出。按了下弹簧，我轻轻把窗框推上见时；钉头还牢牢嵌在窗框的钉眼里，一齐推上去了。我关上窗，钉子又成了整整一枚了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed. Droping [Dropping] of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail, -- farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades -- a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux. They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis -- thus affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open -- that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected. -- By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二个问题要研究的就是逃下去的方式。这一点，我跟你绕着屋子兜了一圈，就胸有成竹了。隔开那扇窗子五尺半左右的地方，有根避雷针。谁也没法从这根避雷针上够着窗口，别说是跳进窗里了。可是我看到四楼的百叶窗是别的一种，巴黎的木匠师傅称做‘铁格窗’——这种款式目前很少来用，在里昂和波尔多某些古老的府邸上，倒还时常看得见。样子象普通的门，是单扇，不是双扇，只是下半扇是格子窗，或者铸成镂空铁栏，这就可以给人当作绝妙的把手。列士巴奈太太家的百叶窗足足有三尺半宽。咱们当时从房子后面望上去，看到两扇百叶窗全都半开半闭——就是说，百叶窗跟墙面恰正成个直角。警察大概也象我一样，查过那幢楼房的后面；要是检查过的话，不会不看这两扇铁格窗的宽度，但他们没看出窗子有这么宽，就算看到了，反正也没当做一回事。其实，他们既然深信这地方不能当做逃的出路，自然在这儿检查得马马虎虎了。可是，我看清楚了，床头窗口那扇百叶窗如果完全推开到挨着墙，离开进窗外还不到两尺呢。还有一点也很清楚，只有身手异常矫捷，胆大包天，浑身使劲，才可能从避雷针爬进窗里。现在假定这扇百叶窗完全敞开，只有二尺半的距离；强盗大可以紧紧抓住百叶窗上的铁格。然后松开避雷针，两脚牢牢顶住墙，大胆从上面纵身一跳，他就可以把百叶窗顺势一推关上了。如果假定当时开着窗，连他的人都可以趁势跳进屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You will see," he said, "that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here. The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is a mere guess -- a very silly one -- and no more. How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained? Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life -- saw no company -- seldom went out -- had little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best -- why did he not take all? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold was abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities -- that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence. It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention -- that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this -- let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit that there was something excessively outré -- something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在可别忘了我提请你注意的几点——特别的声音，异常矫健的身手，以及那样惨无人道的离奇凶杀案竟然毫无动机——咱们回过头来看看凶杀的惨状吧。房里这个女人给人用手扼死，然后给人倒栽葱塞进烟囱里。普通凶手可不用这种杀人方式。尤其不用这种方法藏尸灭迹。照尸首给塞进烟囱的情况看来，你就会承认那里头有点离奇古怪——一般看来，人们决不会做出这种事，哪怕凶手是最最狠毒的人。你还想想看，把尸体硬塞进这么狭的洞里，几个人一齐使尽力气都拖不下来，那股子劲该有多猛啊！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses -- very thick tresses -- of grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp -- sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L'Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed.

<div class="line_en">"True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice, -- the expression, 'mon Dieu!' This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder. It is possible -- indeed it is far more than probable -- that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses -- for I have no right to call them more -- since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement, which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of 'Le Monde,' (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our residence."</div>

<div class="line_en">CAUGHT -- In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the -- inst., (the morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species.

<div class="line_en">"I do not know it," said Dupin. "I am not sure of it. Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement -- about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He will reason thus: — 'I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value -- to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself -- why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne -- at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault -- they have failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, I am known. The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.' "</div>

<div class="line_en">Returning home from some sailors' frolic on the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，或者不如说是出人命案的那天清晨，他跟几个水手玩了一通，回到家里，只见这头野兽呆在他卧室里，原来它是从隔壁一间密室里破门闯进来的，原还以为把它关在密室里不怕它逃走呢。猩猩拿着把剃刀，满脸肥皂泡，坐在镜子前，打算刮脸，不用说，准是从前它打密室的钥匙洞里看到主人这么做过。眼看这么凶猛的一头巨兽，手里拿着这么危险的一把凶器，又使得这么熟练，他不由吓坏了，一时不知怎么是好。他一向用鞭子压服这头猛兽，哪怕野性大大发作时也压得住，这回他又用上了鞭子。猩猩一见鞭子，顿时跳出房门，奔下楼，真是不巧，有扇窗子正开着，它就跳出窗子，逃到街上去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning. In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L'Espanaye's chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法国水手大失所望地追了出去；这头猩猩，一手仍然捏着剃刀，不时停下脚回头看看，对追赶的人挤眉弄眼，指手画脚，等到快追上时，才又逃跑。这样追来追去追了老半天。这时快清晨三点钟了，街上一片死寂。逃到毛格街后面一条胡同里，猩猩看见列士巴奈太太家四楼寝室那扇开着的窗子里有灯火，不由得留了神。它奔到屋子跟前，一眼看见避雷针，就身手异常矫捷地顺杆爬上去，百叶窗子正巧开着，靠着墙，它一把抓住百叶窗，趁势纵身一跳，跳到床头上。这一套工夫不消一分钟就耍完了。猩猩一闯进房里，百叶窗就又给踢开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning-rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，水手心里又喜又急。喜的是，这回大有希望把野兽重新抓住，因为它既然自投罗网，就不见得逃得出来，要么顺着避雷针爬下来，只要下来就可以截住它；急的是，这畜生不定在屋内会干出些什么来，真是放心不下。这一想，他就照旧紧追不放。要爬上避雷针倒不难，尤其是个水手更不在话下；可是刚爬到窗口，窗子离开他还有一大截，就爬不进去了；至多只能探出头去看看屋内的情形。这一看差点没把他魂吓掉，失手摔下来。就在这时，半夜里传来凄厉呼叫，惊醒了毛格街居民的好梦。列士巴奈太太母女，身穿睡衣，看来正在整理上文提到过的铁箱里的信件。这口铁箱原先就已推到房间当中，打开着，里头的东西全散在地上。被害人准是背对着窗口坐着；从那头野兽闯进房里，到传出喊声这段时间来看，她们大概没马上看见它。一定把百叶窗啪啪地响当作给风刮的呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L'Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水手朝里一看，只见这头巨兽早已揪住列士巴奈太太的头发（她刚梳过头，头发全披散开来），这时正模仿理发师，挥着剃刀，在她脸上乱刮。女儿倒在地上，一动不动；她早就昏倒了。这时，老太太的头发给揪了下来，她又喊又叫，拼命挣扎，猩猩原来大概没存恶意，这一来就勃然大怒，顿起杀心。猩猩那条铁臂使劲一挥，差点没把脑袋割下来。猩猩一见血，恰如火上加油，益发狠了。只见它咬牙切齿，两眼杀气腾腾，扑到那姑娘身上，伸出可怕的爪子，扼住脖子，扼得她咽了气才松手。这当儿，它眼睛骨溜溜地乱转，凑巧看到床头外边主人那副吓坏了的脸色，心里准没忘了催命鞭的滋味，顿时不再发火，反而害怕起来。自知难逃一打，就一昧想掩盖犯下的血腥罪行，紧张不安地在房里跳来跳去；碰到什么家具，就一把掀翻砸烂，还拖开床垫。临了，先抓起小姐的尸体，塞在事后发现尸体的那烟囱里，再马上拉起老太太的尸体，从窗口一头扔下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home -- dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猩猩拖着遍体鳞伤的尸首走到窗口，水手就吓得缩了回去，连爬都爬不动，只得顺势滑下去，赶紧马上回家——生怕这件惨案闹穿，害他受罪；惊恐之下，巴不得把这头猩猩的命运置之度外。大家在楼梯听见的话，就是那法国人吓得失声叫出来的，当中还夹杂着那野兽神哭鬼号般的吱吱叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door. It must have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes. Le Bon was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没什么好再交代的了。猩猩一定是大家破门进去前，顺着避雷针逃出房的。它跳出窗口时准把窗子碰上了。后来，猩猩给失主亲自抓到，卖给植物园，得了一大笔钱。我们到警察厅长的官衙里报告了事实真相。杜宾另外串插一些意见，勒？本才当场开释了。厅长大人尽管对我朋友有些好感，可是眼看疑案破获，掩饰不住心头羞惭，只好冷言冷语刺了一两句，聊以自慰，说什么不该狗拿耗子，多管闲事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let him talk," said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply. "Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience. I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no stamen. It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna, -- or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature after all. I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has 'de nier ce qui est, et d'expliquer ce qui n'est pas.' "</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让他说去吧，”杜宾认为犯不着答腔，“让他发发宏论，他才安生。我把他将死，就称心了。话说回来，这件疑案他破不了，根本不象他想的那么是值得奇怪的事；因为老实说，我们这位朋友警察厅长尽管老奸巨猾，却欠缺深谋远虑。他有智无谋。只有头，没有身体，跟拉浮娜女神的像一样——顶多只有头和肩膀，象条鳌鱼。但到底不失是个机伶鬼。那套油滑手段特别叫我喜欢，他就是靠那套功夫以智囊闻名于世。我意思是说他只会‘否认事实，强词夺理’。”">查看中文翻译</div>
