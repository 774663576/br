<div class="line_en">Sometimes in big Hollywood movies they'll have these crazy chase scenes where somebody jumps or gets thrown from a moving car. The person hits the ground and rolls for a bit. Then they come to a stop and pop up and dust themselves off, like it was no big deal. Whenever I see that I think, That's rubbish. Getting thrown out of a moving car hurts way worse than that.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was nine years old when my mother threw me out of a moving car. It happened on a Sunday. I know it was on a Sunday because we were coming home from church, and every Sunday in my childhood meant church. We never missed church. My mother was -- and still is -- a deeply religious woman. Very Christian. Like indigenous peoples around the world, black South Africans adopted the religion of our colonizers. By "adopt" I mean it was forced on us. The white man was quite stern with the native. "You need to pray to Jesus," he said. "Jesus will save you." To which the native replied, "Well, we do need to be saved -- saved from you, but that's beside the point. So let's give this Jesus thing a shot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九岁的时候，我妈就把我从一辆正在行驶的车上扔了出来。那天是周日。我记得很清楚，因为那时我们正在从教堂回家的路上。在我的童年里，每个周日都是属于教堂的。我们从来不会错过礼拜。我妈那时是——现在依然是——一个非常有信仰的女人。虔诚的基督徒。和世界各地的原住民一样，南非的黑人也接受了殖民者的宗教。我说“接受”，但其实是强迫接受。白人对本地的原住民很严苛。他们说：“你们要向耶稣祷告，耶稣会拯救你们。”原住民则回答道：“好吧，我们的确需要被拯救——把我们从你们手中拯救出来，不过这是另一码事了，所以让我们来试试这个耶稣吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My childhood involved church, or some form of church, at least four nights a week. Tuesday night was the prayer meeting. Wednesday night was Bible study. Thursday night was Youth church. Friday and Saturday we had off. (Time to sin!) Then on Sunday we went to church. Three churches, to be precise. The reason we went to three churches was because my mom said each church gave her something different. The first church offered jubilant praise of the Lord. The second church offered deep analysis of the scripture, which my mom loved. The third church offered passion and catharsis; it was a place where you truly felt the presence of the Holy Spirit inside you. Completely by coincidence, as we moved back and forth between these churches, I noticed that each one had its own distinct racial makeup: Jubilant church was mixed church. Analytical church was white church. And passionate, cathartic church, that was black church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的童年充斥着教会或某种形式的教会活动，一周起码有四个晚上要在教会度过。周二晚上是祈祷会。周三晚上是《圣经》学习。周四晚上是青年礼拜。周五周六晚上休息。（原罪之夜！）然后是周日去教堂做礼拜。准确地说，要辗转三个教堂。原因是我妈说，这三个教堂的教会，每一个都能带给她不同的东西。第一个教会，有对上帝的喜悦赞美。第二个教会，有对《圣经》的深度解读，我妈很喜欢。第三个教会，激情澎湃、涤荡灵魂。在那里，你能真正地感受到被圣灵充满的感觉。但在完全偶然的情况下，随着我们与这几个教堂之间的来往，我注意到了每个教堂都有自己特定的种族构成。喜悦赞美教会是多种族融合教会。深度解读教会是白人教会。激情澎湃教会则是黑人教会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My whole family is religious, but where my mother was Team Jesus all the way, my grandmother balanced her Christian faith with the traditional Xhosa beliefs she'd grown up with, communicating with the spirits of our ancestors. For a long time I didn't understand why so many black people had abandoned their indigenous faith for Christianity. But the more we went to church and the longer I sat in those pews the more I learned about how Christianity works: If you're Native American and you pray to the wolves, you're a savage. If you're African and you pray to your ancestors, you're a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that's just common sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的整个家庭都信教，只不过我妈一直信基督，而我的外婆一面信着基督，一面也保留着她从小到大的传统科萨信仰，她会和我们祖先的灵魂交流。很长时间里，我都不明白为什么很多黑人会放弃他们原本的信仰，改信了基督。但是去教堂去得越多，在那些长凳上坐得越久，我就越了解基督教的逻辑：如果你是美国原住民，你向狼祈祷，那你是野蛮人；如果你是非洲人，你向你的祖先祈祷，你是原始人。但当白人向一个能把水变成酒的家伙祈祷，好吧，这很合乎常识。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mixed church was Rhema Bible Church. Rhema was one of those huge, supermodern, suburban megachurches. The pastor, Ray McCauley, was an ex-bodybuilder with a big smile and the personality of a cheerleader. Pastor Ray had competed in the 1974 Mr. Universe competition. He placed third. The winner that year was Arnold Schwarzenegger. Every week, Ray would be up onstage working really hard to make Jesus cool. There was arena-style seating and a rock band jamming out with the latest Christian contemporary pop. Everyone sang along, and if you didn't know the words that was okay because they were all right up there on the Jumbotron for you. It was Christian karaoke, basically. I always had a blast at mixed church.</div>

<div class="line_en">White church was Rosebank Union in Sandton, a very white and wealthy part of Johannesburg. I loved white church because I didn't actually have to go to the main service. My mom would go to that, and I would go to the youth side, to Sunday school. In Sunday school we got to read cool stories. Noah and the flood was obviously a favorite; I had a personal stake there. But I also loved the stories about Moses parting the Red Sea, David slaying Goliath, Jesus whipping the money changers in the temple.</div>

<div class="line_en">I grew up in a home with very little exposure to popular culture. Boyz II Men were not allowed in my mother's house. Songs about some guy grinding on a girl all night long? No, no, no. That was forbidden. I'd hear the other kids at school singing "End of the Road," and I'd have no clue what was going on. I knew of these Boyz II Men, but I didn't really know who they were. The only music I knew was from church: soaring, uplifting songs praising Jesus. It was the same with movies. My mom didn't want my mind polluted by movies with sex and violence. So the Bible was my action movie. Samson was my superhero. He was my He-Man. A guy beating a thousand people to death with the jawbone of a donkey? That's pretty badass. Eventually you get to Paul writing letters to the Ephesians and it loses the plot, but the Old Testament and the Gospels? I could quote you anything from those pages, chapter and verse. There were Bible games and quizzes every week at white church, and I kicked everyone's ass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在成长过程中，我几乎没怎么接触过流行文化。我妈的房子里不准放BoyzIIMen的歌。那种唱男人和女孩整晚大跳贴身热舞的歌？不行不行不行。绝对不能听。我的其他同学在学校会哼唱《路的尽头》，我完全不知道他们在唱什么。我大概听说过BoyzIIMen的名字，但并不真的知道他们是谁。我唯一了解的音乐只来自教堂：那种情绪高昂、鼓舞人心的赞美诗。电影也是一样。我妈希望我的思想永远不会被黄色和暴力的内容污染。所以，《圣经》就是我的动作电影。参孙就是我的超级英雄。他是我的希曼。一个人能用一块驴子的下颌骨打死一千个人？这也太牛了。当然，到保罗和《以弗所书》那部分时，就没什么情节了，不过，要说起《旧约》和《福音书》？每一页、每一章、每一节我都能给你背出来。白人教会每周都有《圣经》猜谜游戏，我能赢过所有人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there was black church. There was always some kind of black church service going on somewhere, and we tried them all. In the township, that typically meant an outdoor, tent-revival-style church. We usually went to my grandmother's church, an old-school Methodist congregation, five hundred African grannies in blue-and-white blouses, clutching their Bibles and patiently burning in the hot African sun. Black church was rough, I won't lie. No air-conditioning. No lyrics up on Jumbotrons. And it lasted forever, three or four hours at least, which confused me because white church was only like an hour -- in and out, thanks for coming. But at black church I would sit there for what felt like an eternity, trying to figure out why time moved so slowly. Is it possible for time to actually stop? If so, why does it stop at black church and not at white church? I eventually decided black people needed more time with Jesus because we suffered more. "I'm here to fill up on my blessings for the week," my mother used to say. The more time we spent at church, she reckoned, the more blessings we accrued, like a Starbucks Rewards Card.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后就是黑人教会。好像时不时哪里就会有黑人教会的服侍活动，我们都会去。在镇上，一般会有那种户外的“帐篷复兴”教会。我们经常去外婆的教会，那是一个传统的循道宗教会，五百多名黑人奶奶们穿着蓝白色的衬衫，抓着《圣经》，极富耐心地曝晒在炽热的非洲太阳下。实话实说，黑人教会的条件很差。没有空调。没有大屏幕滚动播出歌词，而且一开就老半天，起码三四个小时。这让我感觉很迷惑，因为白人教会的活动只有一个小时，包括大家进场退场，还有牧师致感谢词的时间。但是黑人教会能让我感觉我已经在那儿坐了一辈子，一直在思考，为什么时间过得这么慢。是不是时间是有可能静止的？如果是，那么为什么只会在黑人教会静止，却不在白人教会静止呢？最后我的结论是，黑人社群大概需要和耶稣相处得久一点儿，因为他们的生活里有更多的痛苦。“我在这儿可以收获未来一周的祝福。”我妈曾这样说。她觉得，我们在教会待的时间越久，祝福就累积得越多，好像星巴克的积分卡一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Christian karaoke, badass action stories, and violent faith healers -- man, I loved church. The thing I didn't love was the lengths we had to go to in order to get to church. It was an epic slog. We lived in Eden Park, a tiny suburb way outside Johannesburg. It took us an hour to get to white church, another forty-five minutes to get to mixed church, and another forty-five minutes to drive out to Soweto for black church. Then, if that wasn't bad enough, some Sundays we'd double back to white church for a special evening service. By the time we finally got home at night, I'd collapse into bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督教卡拉OK、超级英雄故事、暴力信仰疗法，天哪，我真心爱教堂。但我不喜欢去教堂的那段长路，真可算是艰苦跋涉。我们住在伊登公园，是约翰内斯堡郊外的一个小地方。从那里去到白人教会要一个小时，到多种族教会要再花四十五分钟，然后去位于索韦托的黑人教会还要再开四十五分钟的车。如果一切顺利，有时候我们还会开回白人教会，再参加一次晚祷。等我们最终在深夜回到家中，我会累得一头栽倒在床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Black church had one saving grace. If I could make it to the third or fourth hour I'd get to watch the pastor cast demons out of people. People possessed by demons would start running up and down the aisles like madmen, screaming in tongues. The ushers would tackle them, like bouncers at a club, and hold them down for the pastor. The pastor would grab their heads and violently shake them back and forth, shouting, "I cast out this spirit in the name of Jesus!" Some pastors were more violent than others, but what they all had in common was that they wouldn't stop until the demon was gone and the congregant had gone limp and collapsed on the stage. The person had to fall. Because if he didn't fall that meant the demon was powerful and the pastor needed to come at him even harder. You could be a linebacker in the NFL. Didn't matter. That pastor was taking you down. Good Lord, that was fun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑人教会倒是有个好的地方，如果我能撑到第三或第四个小时，就能看到驱散恶魔的仪式。被恶魔附身的人，此时会像疯了一样在走道上狂奔、尖叫。教堂的引座员会像夜店的保镖那样，将他们按倒在地，押送到牧师面前。牧师会抓住他们的头，前后猛烈摇晃，大喊道：“我要以耶稣之名将此恶魔逐出！”有一些牧师会格外暴力，但所有的牧师都会将教友摇到恶魔从教友身体里离开，那人踉跄着瘫倒在地后才会收手。身体内有恶魔的教友此时必须要跌倒，如果他不倒，就说明体内的恶魔很强，牧师需要下手再狠一点儿。哪怕你是全美橄榄球联盟的钢铁后卫，这儿的牧师也能把你掀翻在地。我的主，真是太有趣了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This particular Sunday, the Sunday I was hurled from a moving car, started out like any other Sunday. My mother woke me up, made me porridge for breakfast. I took my bath while she dressed my baby brother Andrew, who was nine months old. Then we went out to the driveway, but once we were finally all strapped in and ready to go, the car wouldn't start. My mom had this ancient, broken-down, bright-tangerine Volkswagen Beetle that she picked up for next to nothing. The reason she got it for next to nothing was because it was always breaking down. To this day I hate secondhand cars. Almost everything that's ever gone wrong in my life I can trace back to a secondhand car. Secondhand cars made me get detention for being late for school. Secondhand cars left us hitchhiking on the side of the freeway. A secondhand car was also the reason my mom got married. If it hadn't been for the Volkswagen that didn't work, we never would have looked for the mechanic who became the husband who became the stepfather who became the man who tortured us for years and put a bullet in the back of my mother's head -- I'll take the new car with the warranty every time.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the time, I attended a private Catholic school called Maryvale College. I was the champion of the Maryvale sports day every single year, and my mother won the moms' trophy every single year. Why? Because she was always chasing me to kick my ass, and I was always running not to get my ass kicked. Nobody ran like me and my mom. She wasn't one of those "Come over here and get your hiding" type moms. She'd deliver it to you free of charge. She was a thrower, too. Whatever was next to her was coming at you. If it was something breakable, I had to catch it and put it down. If it broke, that would be my fault, too, and the ass-kicking would be that much worse. If she threw a vase at me, I'd have to catch it, put it down, and then run. In a split second, I'd have to think, Is it valuable? Yes. Is it breakable? Yes. Catch it, put it down, now run.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the apartheid regime fell, we knew that the black man was now going to rule. The question was, which black man? Spates of violence broke out between the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC, the African National Congress, as they jockeyed for power. The political dynamic between these two groups was very complicated, but the simplest way to understand it is as a proxy war between Zulu and Xhosa. The Inkatha was predominantly Zulu, very militant and very nationalistic. The ANC was a broad coalition encompassing many different tribes, but its leaders at the time were primarily Xhosa. Instead of uniting for peace they turned on one another, committing acts of unbelievable savagery. Massive riots broke out. Thousands of people were killed. Necklacing was common. That's where people would hold someone down and put a rubber tire over his torso, pinning his arms. Then they'd douse him with petrol and set him on fire and burn him alive. The ANC did it to Inkatha. Inkatha did it to the ANC. I saw one of those charred bodies on the side of the road one day on my way to school. In the evenings my mom and I would turn on our little black-and-white TV and watch the news. A dozen people killed. Fifty people killed. A hundred people killed.</div>

Under apartheid the government provided no public transportation for blacks, but white people still needed us to show up to mop their floors and clean their bathrooms. Necessity being the mother of invention, black people created their own transit system, an informal network of bus routes, controlled by private associations operating entirely outside the law. Because the minibus business was completely unregulated, it was basically organized crime. Different groups ran different routes, and they would fight over who controlled what. There was bribery and general shadiness that went on, a great deal of violence, and a lot of protection money paid to avoid violence. The one thing you didn't do was steal a route from a rival group. Drivers who stole routes would get killed. Being unregulated, minibuses were also very unreliable. When they came, they came. When they didn't, they didn't.</div>

They didn't know they were dealing with the reigning champs of the Maryvale College sports day. We kept going and going until we made it to a twenty-four-hour petrol station and called the police. By then the men were long gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">The British abolished slavery in name but kept it in practice. They did so because, in the mid-1800s, in what had been written off as a near-worthless way station on the route to the Far East, a few lucky capitalists stumbled upon the richest gold and diamond reserves in the world, and an endless supply of expendable bodies was needed to go in the ground and get it all out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Apartheid was perfect racism. It took centuries to develop, starting all the way back in 1652 when the Dutch East India Company landed at the Cape of Good Hope and established a trading colony, Kaapstad, later known as Cape Town, a rest stop for ships traveling between Europe and India. To impose white rule, the Dutch colonists went to war with the natives, ultimately developing a set of laws to subjugate and enslave them. When the British took over the Cape Colony, the descendants of the original Dutch settlers trekked inland and developed their own language, culture, and customs, eventually becoming their own people, the Afrikaners -- the white tribe of Africa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="种族隔离是种族主义的完美形态，经过了几个世纪的进化才得以成形。1652年，荷兰的东印度公司在好望角登陆，建立了一个贸易殖民地，名为科普斯塔德——也就是后来的开普敦——这里成了来往于欧洲与印度的船只歇脚的地方。为了推行白人统治，荷兰殖民者与本地原住民展开了战争，最终立下了一系列法条，征服并奴役了当地的土著。英国人接管了开普殖民地后，荷兰登陆者的后裔们便迁往内陆，并且发展出了他们自己的语言、文化、风俗，最终成为了独立的民族：南非白人——非洲的白人部落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Apartheid was a police state, a system of surveillance and laws designed to keep black people under total control. A full compendium of those laws would run more than three thousand pages and weigh approximately ten pounds, but the general thrust of it should be easy enough for any American to understand. In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the British Empire fell, the Afrikaner rose up to claim South Africa as his rightful inheritance. To maintain power in the face of the country's rising and restless black majority, the government realized they needed a newer and more robust set of tools. They set up a formal commission to go out and study institutionalized racism all over the world. They went to Australia. They went to the Netherlands. They went to America. They saw what worked, what didn't. Then they came back and published a report, and the government used that knowledge to build the most advanced system of racial oppression known to man.</div>
