<div class="line_en">Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother. This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long confinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她果然没有估错，这位爱调皮捣蛋的小伙子发觉乔有点异样，疑心顿起，立即穷追不舍，乔从此开始受苦受难。他诱哄、贿赂、嘲笑、威胁、责备；装漠不关心，以求出其不意地套出真相；宣称他知道，然后又说他不在乎；最后，凭着这般锲而不舍的劲头，他终于满意地相信此事与梅格和布鲁克先生有关。自家私人教师的秘密竟不让他知道，他心中愤愤不平，于是苦苦思索如何好好地出一口怨气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her father's return, but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face. To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew anything about it," began Meg, without looking up. "I was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a few days.

<div class="line_en">Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie's step was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once. Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened during that interview the girls never knew.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.</div>

What torments they are, yet we can't do without them," he said, pinching her cheeks good-humoredly. "Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it's all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won't bear it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这莽撞鬼，怎敢这样说话？你眼里头还有没有我，这样没有规矩？这些姑娘小伙子啊！他们真会折磨人，但没有他们我们又活不下去，”他说着愉快地拧拧她的脸颊，”去，把那小子带来吃饭，告诉他没事了，劝他别在他爷爷面前装得愁眉苦脸的，我受不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔努力装出一副可怜巴巴的样子，但一定没有装好，因为劳伦斯先生笑了，她知道她胜利了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir. He says he won't come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He likes fun, and this way is better than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我是您，我就给他写一封道歉信，先生。他说要您道了歉才下来，还说起华盛顿，而且越说越不像话。一封正式的道歉信可以让他意识到自己是多么愚蠢，并让他心平气和地下来。写吧；他喜欢闹着玩，而这样比当面说更有趣儿。我把信带上去，跟他摆明道理。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He won't come, Sir. He feels badly because you didn't believe him when he said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不会下来的，先生；他心情很坏，因为当他说他不能告诉你的时候，你不信他的话，我想您这样摇他大大伤害了他的感情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance, "What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?" he added, laughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="信中所用的措辞诚恳恭敬，表达了一位绅士对伤害了另一位的深深歉意。乔在劳伦斯先生的秃顶上印了一个吻，跑上楼把道歉信从劳里的门缝下面塞进去，透过钥匙孔谆谆告诫他要听话、有涵养，又讲了一些大道理。看到门又锁上了，她便把信留在那儿让劳里看，自己悄悄走开，才走了几步，年青人从楼梯扶手上滑下来，站在下面等她，脸上流露出一种无比圣洁的神情。”你真好，乔！刚才有没有碰得头破血流？”他笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying slowly, "You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this nonsense."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳伦斯先生敏锐地盯了她一眼，带上眼镜，一字一句地说：“你是只狡猾的小猫，不过我不介意被你和贝思牵着走。来，给我一张纸，我们把这桩荒唐事来个了断。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect?" and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我为此道歉，而且还应该感谢他没有反过来摇我呢，我想。那家伙到底想怎么样？”老人显然为自己的暴躁感到有点不好意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I felt just ready to go to the deuce," he began apologetically.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it. Men always croak when they are hungry," and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去吃你的饭吧，吃饱了你就会好受一些。男人肚子饿的时候喜欢发牢骚。”乔说毕飞步走出，来到前门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered. She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, 'Mrs. John Brooke', whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人人都以为云开雾散，事情就此结束了，谁知这个恶作剧却带来了严重的后果。因为虽然大家都把它忘得一干二净，梅格却把它记在心里。她虽然在人前只字不提，心里却经常想到那位年青人，而且夜里频频做梦。一次，乔在她姐姐的书桌里头找邮票，居然搜得一张上面涂鸦般写满了‘约翰·布鲁克太太’字样的纸片，恨得她咬牙切齿，把纸片投进火中，她知道劳里的玩笑使她又恨又怕的那一天加速到来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's a 'label' on my 'sect'," answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是对‘我派’的‘标价’，”劳里学着艾美的话回答，乖乖地和爷爷一起进餐去了。此后一整天老人心情奇佳，言谈举止也极其谦和恭敬。">查看中文翻译</div>
