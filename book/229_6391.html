<div class="line_en">But just then Bathsheba herself appeared. "No, Gabriel," she said. "Poor Fanny must rest in her old home for her last night. Bring the coffin into the house."</div>

<div class="line_en">The coffin was carried into a small sitting-room and Gabriel was left alone with it. In spite of all his care, the worst had happened, and Bathsheba was about to make a terrible discovery. But suddenly he had an idea. He looked at the words written simply on the coffin lid -- Fanny Robin and child. With a cloth Gabriel carefully removed the last two words. Quietly he left the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，棺木抬进了一间小起居室，盖伯瑞尔独自留下守灵。尽管他小心翼翼，最糟糕的事情还是发生了，芭丝谢芭即将发现真相，这可太糟了。突然，他有主意了。他看着简简单单写在棺木盖上的字——“范妮·罗宾及孩子”，然后用一块布小心地把最后两个字盖祝悄悄地，他离开了房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That afternoon Joseph Poorgrass was bringing Fanny's coffin back from Casterbridge. Feeling a little frightened of the dead body behind him in the cart, and depressed by the autumn fog, he stopped for some beer at a pub, where he met Jan Coggan and Laban Tall. There Gabriel Oak found the three men, completely drunk, two hours later. As Joseph was clearly incapable of driving the cart, Gabriel drove it to Weatherbury himself. On the way into the village, the vicar stopped him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午，约瑟夫·普格拉斯把范妮的棺木从卡斯特桥运回。身后的马车上放着的尸体让他觉得有点害怕，秋雾也使他感到压抑，他便停下马车进一家酒馆喝啤酒。在酒馆他遇到了简·考根和拉班·托尔。两小时后，盖伯瑞尔在酒馆找到这三个人时，他们都已醉倒不起了。约瑟夫是没法赶车了，于是，盖伯瑞尔便自己把车赶回威瑟伯里。在进村的路上，牧师拦住了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I could take the coffin to the church for the night, sir," offered Gabriel, hoping to prevent Bathsheba from seeing it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bathsheba was in a strange mood. She felt lonely and miserable, but she had not stopped loving her husband, in spite of her anxiety about his past. She was waiting for him to come home, when Liddy knocked and entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芭丝谢芭心情很怪。她既觉得孤单、痛苦，对丈夫的过去颇为担扰，但仍未停止对她丈夫的爱，她正在等待他回家，这时利蒂敲门进来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't believe it!" she cried. "There's only one name on the coffin lid! But I suppose it could be true."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不相信！”她叫道。“棺材盖上只有一个名字！可这传说也可能是真的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="停了一会儿，她又缓慢地说，“我要看看你！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She said no more, and Liddy went quietly out of the room. Bathsheba felt almost sure she knew the truth about Fanny and Troy, but she wanted to be certain. She entered the sitting-room where the coffin lay. Holding her hot hands to her forehead she cried, "Tell me your secret, Fanny! I hope it isn't true there are two of you! If I could only look. at you, I'd know!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不再说什么，利蒂悄声出了门。芭丝谢芭几乎已确信范妮和托伊的事，可她还想证实一下。她走进停放棺木的那间起居室，把发烫的手放在额头，喊道，“把你的秘密告诉我，范妮！希望这不是真的，不是两个人！我要是能看你一眼，就会知道的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few moments later, she stood beside the uncovered coffin. Staring in, she said, "It was best to know the worst, and I know it now!" Her tears fell fast beside the dead pair in the coffin, tears for Fanny and for herself. Although Bathsheba, not Fanny, had married Troy, in death Fanny was the winner. She was taking her revenge now on Bathsheba for the difficulties she had experienced in her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了片刻，她站在揭去盖子的棺木边，一边向里看，一边说，“最好还是知道最坏的情况，现在我知道了！”她的眼泪落在棺木里那死去的两人身边，这是哭范妮的泪水，也是哭自己的泪水。虽然是芭丝谢芭而不是范妮嫁给了托伊，可死去的范妮才是获胜者。她活着时遭受了种种磨难，现在正在向芭丝谢芭复仇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Troy stood completely still when he saw the mother and baby. Little by little his shoulders bent forward, and his face showed deep sadness. Bathsheba was watching his expression closely, and she had never been more miserable. Slowly Troy knelt to give Fanny Robin a gentle kiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托伊看到那母亲和婴儿，呆立不动。然后他才一点一点地弯下身，脸上显出深深的悲伤。芭丝谢芭仔细观察他的表情，她可从未见过他这样伤心。慢慢地，托伊跪下，给范妮·罗宾轻轻一吻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, stay, I insist!" He held her arm and together they looked into the coffin.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Can you give me a reason?" asked Bathsheba, fighting to control herself. Perhaps it was unfortunate that she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你能说出理由吗？”芭丝谢芭问道，努力克制着自己。也许她并不该问。">查看中文翻译</div>

I would have married her, if I'd never seen your beautiful face! And I wish I had married her!" He turned to Fanny. "But never mind, darling," he said, "in the sight of God you are my wife!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一向是个黑了心的坏蛋，可是这个女人，这个死去的女人，对我来说比你更加重要，过去是，现在是，将来也是。我要不是看到你这张漂亮的脸，早就娶了她了！我真应该娶了她！”他转向范妮。“不过别在意，亲爱的，”他说，“在上帝的眼里，你才是我的妻子！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are nothing to me, nothing," said Troy heartlessly. "A ceremony in front of a vicar doesn't make a marriage. I don't consider myself your husband."</div>

<div class="line_en">Bathsheba wanted only to get away from him and his words. She ran straight out of the house. She stayed out all night, wrapped in a cloak, waiting for the coffin to be taken for burial. As soon as the men had taken it away the next morning, she reentered the house, very cautiously to avoid Troy, but her husband had gone out very early and did not return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芭丝谢芭此刻只想从他身边跑开，不去听他说的那些话。她径直跑到房子外面，身上裹着一件斗篷，在外面待了一整夜，等着棺木抬出下葬。次日早晨，人们刚把棺木抬走，她便进到屋内，小心地躲避着托伊。但是，她的丈夫一大早便外出了，没有回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
