<div class="line_en">"Flamingos," Laila said. She looked at him sitting against the wall, his good leg bent at the knee. She had an urge to touch him again, as she had earlier by the front gate when she'd run to him. It embarrassed her now to think of how she'd thrown her arms around his neck and wept into his chest, how she'd said his name over and over in a slurring, thick voice. Had she acted too eagerly, she wondered, too desperately? Maybe so. But she hadn't been able to help it. And now she longed to touch him again, to prove to herself again that he was really here, that he was not a dream, an apparition.</div>

After they'd tied the cousin's feet and flogged his soles bloody, they had presented him with a choice: Either destroy the paintings or make the flamingos decent. So the cousin had picked up his brush and painted trousers on every last bird.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔利班见到那些画的时候，塔里克说，看到那些鸟裸露的长腿，他们很生气。把那个表哥的双脚绑起来，用鞭子抽得他脚底出血之后，他们向他提供了一个选择：要么把画毁掉，要么把火烈鸟画得雅观一些。所以表哥拿起了画笔，给每一只鸟画上了裤子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laughter came up, but Laila pushed it back down. She was ashamed of her yellowing teeth, the missing incisor. Ashamed of her withered looks and swollen lip. She wished she'd had the chance to wash her face, at least comb her hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说完他们两人哈哈大笑，但是莱拉强行抑制住笑声。她为自己缺了一个门牙的发黄牙齿而感到脸上无光。为自己苍老的面容和肿胀的嘴唇感到羞愧。她希望刚才她有机会洗脸，哪怕梳理一下头发也好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But he'll have the last laugh, the cousin," Tariq said. "He painted those trousers with watercolor. When the Taliban are gone, he'll just wash them off." He smiled -- Laila noticed that he had a missing tooth of his own -- and looked down at his hands. "Indeed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但最得意的人是他，那个表哥，”塔里克说，“他用水彩画上了那些裤子。塔利班一走，他就把它们洗掉了。”他笑了起来——莱拉发现他自己也缺了一颗牙齿——望着自己的双手。“真的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was wearing a pakol on his head, hiking boots, and a black wool sweater tucked into the waist of khaki pants. He was half smiling, nodding slowly. Laila didn't remember him saying this before, this word indeed, and this pensive gesture, the fingers making a tent in his lap, the nodding, it was new too. Such an adult word, such an adult gesture, and why should it be so startling? He was an adult now, Tariq, a twenty-five-year-old man with slow movements and a tiredness to his smile. Tall, bearded, slimmer than in her dreams of him, but with strong-looking hands, workman's hands, with tortuous, full veins. His face was still lean and handsome but not fair-skinned any longer; his brow had a weathered look to it, sunburned, like his neck, the brow of a traveler at the end of a long and wearying journey. His pakol was pushed back on his head, and she could see that he'd started to lose his hair. The hazel of his eyes was duller than she remembered, paler, or perhaps it was merely the light in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他戴着毡帽，穿着登山鞋，黑色的羊毛衫塞进卡其裤的裤腰。他微笑着，慢慢点头。莱拉不记得他从前说话是不是这样的：“真的”这个词，若有所思的表情，手指在膝盖上搭成帐篷，连这点头的方式也是新的。如此成熟的词语，如此成熟的动作，她为什么会觉得吃惊呢？现在他已经是成年人了，塔里克，他是一个动作迟慢、笑容中带着疲惫的二十五岁的男人了。他很高，留了大胡子，比她梦到的他要瘦一些，但双手看上去很强壮，一双劳动者的手，布满了弯弯曲曲的血管。他的脸依旧瘦削而英俊，但肤色已经不像从前那么浅了；他的额头有风吹雨打的痕迹，和脖子一样，都被太阳晒得发黑，这是一个终于结束了劳累的漫长征途的旅人的额头。他的毡帽被推向脑袋后面，她能看出来他已经开始秃顶了。他那双褐色的眼睛比她记忆中的更加阴郁，更加苍白，或者这只是由于受到房间里光线的影响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila thought of Tariq's mother, her unhurried manners, the clever smiles, the dull purple wig. And his father, with his squinty gaze, his wry humor. Earlier, at the door, with a voice full of tears, tripping over her own words, she'd told Tariq what she thought had happened to him and his parents, and he had shaken his head. So now she asked him how they were doing, his parents. But she regretted the question when Tariq looked down and said, a bit distractedly, "Passed on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉想起了塔里克的母亲，想起了她那从容不迫的举动、机灵的笑容和暗紫色的假发。也想起了他的父亲，想起了他那斜斜的目光和诙谐的个性。刚才在门口，莱拉泪如雨下，声音颤抖着，跟塔里克说起她还以为他和他的父母都已遇难，塔里克当时摇了摇头。所以现在她问他，他们——他的父母——过得怎么样。但塔里克望着地面，稍微有点心烦意乱地说：“过世了。”这时她后悔说了这句话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pir Panjal. Pakistan," he said. "Where I live is called Murree; it's a summer retreat, an hour from Islamabad. It's hilly and green, lots of trees, high above sea level. So it's cool in the summer. Perfect for tourists."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“皮尔潘甲山。在巴基斯坦，”他说，“我住的那个地方叫穆里；那儿是个避暑胜地，距离伊斯兰堡一个小时的车程。那儿有很多山和植物，有很多树，海拔很高。所以夏天很凉快。是一个旅游胜地。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I had to tie her to a stake in the ground," Tariq was saying. "And build a fence. Because of the wolves. In the foothills where I live, there's a wooded area nearby, maybe a quarter of a mile away, pine trees mostly, some fir, deodars. They mostly stick to the woods, the wolves do, but a bleating goat, one that likes to go wandering, that can draw them out. So the fence. The stake."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我得把它系在插进地面的木桩上，”塔里克说，“还修了一道篱笆。因为有狼。我住在一个山脚的地方，附近有一片树林，估计有四分之一平方英里吧，主要是松树，也有一些冷杉和雪杉。那些狼主要生活在树林里，但一只喜欢到处乱晃的咩咩叫的山羊会把它们引出来。所以我修了篱笆，打了木桩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The British had built it as a hill station near their military headquarters in Rawalpindi, he said, for the Victorians to escape the heat. You could still spot a few relics of the colonial times, Tariq said, the occasional tearoom, tin-roofed bungalows, called cottages, that sort of thing. The town itself was small and pleasant. The main street was called the Mall, where there was a post office, a bazaar, a few restaurants, shops that overcharged tourists for painted glass and hand-knotted carpets. Curiously, the Mall's one-way traffic flowed in one direction one week, the opposite direction the next week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早在维多利亚时期，他说，因为那儿临近英国军队在拉瓦尔品第的司令部，英国人就把它建成避暑用的山区营地。人们还能看到一些殖民时期遗留下来的残迹，塔里克说，茶馆啦，铁皮屋顶的平房啦，那些所谓别墅啦，诸如此类的东西。城市本身很小，但是很宜人。主干道叫做摩尔街，街上有一个邮局，一个市场，几家餐厅，还有一些靠出售绘了图案的玻璃和手工编织的地毯来敲诈游客的商店。还有一点很奇怪，摩尔街是单行道，一个星期车朝这个方向开，一个星期车朝另外一个方向开。">查看中文翻译</div>

He watched little emaciated boys carrying water in their jerry cans, gathering dog droppings to make fire, carving toy AK-47s out of wood with dull knives, lugging the sacks of wheat flour that no one could make bread from that held together.

But, for a moment, standing there with Tariq in the sunlight, it was as though those years had never happened.
