<div class="line_en">All these years I kept my true nature hidden, running along like a small shadow so nobody could catch me. And because I moved so secretly now my daughter does not see me.

<div class="line_cn" title="这些年来，我一直将真正的自己严严实实地罩住，竭力将自己蹬缩成一个小小的黑影，所以，谁也抓不住我。我悄然无声地度日，以至女儿对我也竟是视而不见。她见到的是自己的购物单，支票的超兑，桌上没有放稳妥的烟灰缸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Earlier in the summer, the servants had covered all the windows with bamboo curtains to drive out the sun. Every bed was covered with a woven mat, our only bedding during the months of constant wet heat. And the hot bricks of the courtyard were crisscrossed with bamboo paths. Autumn had come, but without its cool mornings and evenings. And so the stale heat still remained in the shadows behind the curtains, heating up the acrid smells of my chamber pot, seeping into my pillow, chafing the back of my neck and puffing up my cheeks, so that I awoke that morning with a restless complaint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早在初夏时分，佣人已在房内各窗棂前挂上竹帘，床上铺上草席。现在秋天来了，但早晚还是毫无凉意，帘子挡着滞留了一夜的暑热，空气是浑浊的，混杂着便壶里刺鼻的尿骚臭。汗水湿透了我枕席，头颈上汗淋淋的，一觉睡醒后，只觉得头涨国肿，心里十分烦躁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In 1918, the year that I was four, the Moon Festival arrived during an autumn in Wushi that was unusually hot, terribly hot. When I awoke that morning, the fifteenth day of the eighth moon, the straw mat covering my bed was already sticky. Everything in the room smelled of wet grass simmering in the heat.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is the same as I explained yesterday," she said, lifting me out of my bed and setting me on her knee. And my sleepy mind tried to remember what she had told me upon waking the morning before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“昨天不是跟你说过了。”她说着把我抱到膝上，开始给我穿衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We are burning the Five Evils," I said drowsily, then squirmed out of her warm lap. I climbed on top of a little stool and looked out the window into the courtyard below. I saw a green coil curled in the shape of a snake, with a tail that billowed yellow smoke. The other day, Amah had shown me that the snake had come out of a colorful box decorated with five evil creatures: a swimming snake, a jumping scorpion, a flying centipede, a dropping-down spider, and a springing lizard. The bite of any one of these creatures could kill a child, explained Amah. So I was relieved to think we had caught the Five Evils and were burning their corpses. I didn't know the green coil was merely incense used to chase away mosquitoes and small flies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们在熏‘五毒’吧？”我睡眼惺忪地咕噜了一句，从她膝头爬下来，又攀上窗边往院于里张望着；我看见一盘绿色的东西，那样子活像一条盘踞着的蛇，那腾起的黄烟就像它翘起的尾巴。几天前我就看见阿妈把它从一只彩盒里拿出来，盒子上画着五种毒虫：蛇、蝎、蜈蚣、蜘蛛和衡妈，“这五种毒虫的任何一种，都足可咬死一个孩子。”阿妈曾这么对我说过。因此每每想到我们已逮住了“五毒”并正在焚烧它们，我就会大大松一口气。我不知道，其实这不过是一种绿色的驱蚊蝇的线香。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was another smell, outside, something burning, a pungent fragrance that was half sweet and half bitter. "What's that stinky smell?" I asked my amah, who always managed to appear next to my bed the instant I was awake. She slept on a cot in a little room next to mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋外弥漫着一股带焦甘的香味；似在焚烧着什么。“什么味？”我问照看我的女佣阿妈，每天早上我一睁开眼的刹那，她总会出现在我床边。她睡在隔壁房的帆布床上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“今天你可没时间玩了，”阿妈边给我套上衣服边叮嘱我，“你妈已替你做好一套新的虎纹装，那是特地过节穿的。如今你已是个大姑娘了，你可以去参加那个仪式了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stand still, Ying-ying!" she cried, her usual lament, while I giggled and wobbled on the stool. And then she yanked the full length of my hair like the reins of a horse and before I could fall off the stool again, she quickly twisted my hair into a single braid off to the side, weaving into it five strands of colorful silk. She wound my braid into a tight ball, then arranged and snipped the loose silk strands until they fell into a neat tassel.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then I heard voices in the courtyard. Standing on my stool, I strained to find them. Somebody was complaining about the heat: "…feel my arm, steamed soft clear to the bone." Many relatives from the north had arrived for the Moon Festival and were staying for the week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，院子里传来一阵人声：“……这个怪天气，骨头都要给悟烂了……”他们抱怨着这不合时宜的暑气。家里来了好多亲戚，他们从北方赶来这儿过节，起码得住上一个星期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She spun me around to inspect her handiwork. I was roasting in the lined silk jacket and pants obviously made with a cooler day in mind. My scalp was burning with the pain of Amah's attentions. What kind of day could be worth so much suffering?</div>

<div class="line_en">Standing perfectly still like that, I discovered my shadow. At first it was just a dark spot on the bamboo mats that covered the courtyard bricks. It had short legs and long arms, a dark coiled braid just like mine. When I shook my head, it shook its head. We flapped our arms. We raised one leg. I turned to walk away and it followed me. I turned back around quickly and it faced me. I lifted the bamboo mat to see if I could peel off my shadow, but it was under the mat, on the brick. I shrieked with delight at my shadow's own cleverness. I ran to the shade under the tree, watching my shadow chase me. It disappeared. I loved my shadow, this dark side of me that had my same restless nature.</div>

Baba was in a new brown-colored gown, which while plain was of an obviously fine-quality silk weave and workmanship. Mama had on a jacket and skirt with colors that were the reverse of mine: black silk with yellow bands. My half-sisters wore rose-colored tunics and so did their mothers, my father's concubines. My older brother had on a blue jacket embroidered with shapes resembling Buddha scepters for long life.

At the last moment, before we all set off, I wriggled out of Amah's grasp and jumped out of the rickshaw. I climbed into the rickshaw with my mother in it, which displeased Amah, because this was presumptuous behavior on my part and also because Amah loved me better than her own. She had given up her own child, a baby son, when her husband had died and she had come to our house to be my nursemaid. But I was very spoiled because of her; she had never taught me to think about her feelings. So I thought of Amah only as someone for my comfort, the way you might think of a fan in the summer or a heater in the winter, a blessing you appreciate and love only when it is no longer there.</div>

At the dock, I watched as the old ladies and men started climbing aboard a large boat our family had rented.

And sure enough, I turned around and a sullen woman was now squatting in front of the bucket of fish. I watched as she took out a sharp, thin knife and began to slice open the fish bellies, pulling out the red slippery insides and throwing them over her shoulder into the lake. I saw her scrape off the fish scales, which flew in the air like shards of glass. And then there were two chickens that no longer gurgled after their heads were chopped off. And a big snapping turtle that stretched out its neck to bite a stick, and -- whuck!-- off fell its head. And dark masses of thin freshwater eels, swimming furiously in a pot.

And loud clanks and hissing sounds erupted as once again the boat began to move. Then the boy next to me dove into the water.

In my panic, in hearing waking voices toward the front of the boat, I quickly dipped my hands in the bowl of turtle's blood and smeared this on my sleeves, and on the front of my pants and jacket.

But they sounded evil, the way she hurled and spat the words out. She yanked off my jacket, pulled off my pants. She said I smelled like "something evil this" and I looked like "something evil that." Her voice was trembling not so much with anger as with fear. "Your mother, now she will be glad to wash her hands of you," Amah said with great remorse. "She will banish us both to Kunming." And then I was truly frightened, because I had heard that Kunming was so far away nobody ever came to visit, and that it was a wild place surrounded by a stone forest ruled by monkeys. Amah left me crying on the back of the boat, standing in my white cotton undergarments and tiger slippers.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were some shouts from the floating pavilion, and I strained to see faces of Amah, Baba, Mama. People were crowded on one side of the pavilion, leaning over, pointing, looking into our boat. All strangers, laughing red faces, loud voices. Where was Amah? Why did my mother not come? A little girl pushed her way through some legs. "That's not me!" she cried. "I'm here. I didn't fall in the water." The people in the boat roared with laughter and turned away.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the dock, with the bright moon behind me, I once again saw my shadow. It was shorter this time, shrunken and wild-looking.

"Sinking into a simmering sea!" she sang happily, and I could hear these suns sizzling and crackling in death.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now a fairy -- the Queen Mother of the Western Skies!-- was flying toward the Master Archer. She opened a box and held up a glowing ball -- no, not a baby sun but a magic peach, the peach of everlasting life! I could see the Moon Lady pretending to be busy with her embroidery, but she was watching her husband. She saw him hide the peach in a box. And then the Master Archer raised his bow and vowed to fast for one year to show he had the patience to live forever.

<div class="line_en">"I have a wish," I said in a whisper, and still she did not hear me. So I walked closer yet, until I could see the face of the Moon Lady: shrunken cheeks, a broad oily nose, large glaring teeth, and red-stained eyes.
