<div class="line_en">This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced atemporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in alike degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished tobe as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning assoon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfortthey would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishesof everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton andthe two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as littlevalued, as it was professedly sought.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked theidleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton wasashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy wasproud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they woulddespise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of thethree, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her toit entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full andminute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of thebest place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw outexpressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropta reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect wasproduced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust inthe latter. An effort even yet lighter might have made her theirfriend. Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! But solittle were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, thatif Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day withouthearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kindenough to bestow on herself.</div>

Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour toElinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all. Because theyneither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe themgood-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied themsatirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical; but THAT did not signify.

<div class="line_en">All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totallyunsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thingfor the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her youngfriends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid oldwoman so long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes ather own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellentspirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's welldoing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detailof her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire. One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint. Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, atdifferent times, the most striking resemblance between this baby andevery one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing hisfather of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly likeevery other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought toacknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in theworld.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，这些妒忌和不满全然没有引起詹宁斯太太的猜疑，她只觉得姑娘们呆在一块是件令人愉快的事情。每天晚上都要祝贺她的年轻朋友们能避开她这傻老婆子，清闲了这么长时间。她有时到约翰爵士家，有时在自己家里，跟她们呆在一起。然而不管在哪儿，她总是精神焕发，兴高采烈，神气十足。她把夏洛特的顺利恢复归功于她自己的精心照料，她很想详细准确地叙说一下她的情况，可惜愿意听的只有斯蒂尔小姐一个人。有一桩事确实引起了她的不安，为此她天天都要抱怨几句。帕尔默先生坚持他们男人的一个共同观点，认为所有的婴儿都是一个样，真不像个做父亲的。虽然詹宁斯太太在不同时候能觉察这小家伙同他父母双方的个个亲戚都酷似，她却无法让他父亲接受这一看法。她无法使他相信，这小家伙和同他一般大小的其他小孩不尽相同；甚至也无法叫他认可这样一个简单的意见，即这小家伙是天下最漂亮的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this timebefell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her two sisterswith Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, anotherof her acquaintance had dropt in-a circumstance in itself notapparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginationsof other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of ourconduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happinessmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the presentinstance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outruntruth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the MissDashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, sheimmediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and thismisconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards ofinvitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a smallmusical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly greatinconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, whatwas still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearingto treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might notexpect to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointingthem, it was true, must always be hers. But that was not enough; forwhen people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to bewrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better fromthem.</div>

<div class="line_en">To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, asnot to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of hertoilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes oftheir being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped HER minuteobservation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked everything; was never easy till she knew the price of every part ofMarianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogetherwith better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopesof finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself. Theimpertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generallyconcluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, wasconsidered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for afterundergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, thecolour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almostsure of being told that upon "her word she looked vastly smart, and shedared to say she would make a great many conquests."</div>

In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group ofyoung men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-casesat Gray's.

<div class="line_en">He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bowwhich assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he wasexactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happyhad it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on hisown merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then hisbrother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what theill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun. But while shewondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find thatthe emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity withthe modesty and worth of the other. Why they WERE different, Robertexclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour'sconversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extremeGAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in propersociety, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to anynatural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any materialsuperiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.</div>

The expense wouldbe nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether anattention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to berequisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to hisfather. Fanny was startled at the proposal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰。达什伍德同他大妹妹一样不喜爱音乐，因而思想也在随意开小差。他晚会期间想到一个主意，回到家里说给妻子听，征求她的同意。鉴于丹尼森太太误以为他妹妹在他家里作客，他应该趁詹宁斯太太出去忙碌的时候，确实请她们来家作客。花销微乎其微，也不会带来什么不便；他是个很有良心的人，为了彻底履行他对先父的诺言，完全有必要关照她们。范妮听到这个建议，不禁大吃一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; andI think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very wellby Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but theMiss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will likethem; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and sodoes my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the MissSteeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolutionof inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slylysuspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, bybringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne asTHEIR visitor.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes afterits arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in theexpectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafedon so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-willtowards her arose from something more than merely malice againstherself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thingthat Lucy wished. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of LadyMiddleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. JohnDashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability ofgreater.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that hadprocured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company andher sister's, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as LadyMiddleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really andreasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Suchan opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above allthings, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation themost gratifying to her feelings! It was an advantage that could not betoo gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and thevisit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days'time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinorof their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event. Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accountsof the favour they were in, as must be universally striking. Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in herlife, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book madeby some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not knowwhether she should ever be able to part with them.</div>
