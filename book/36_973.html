<div class="line_en">She began to wonder how one would go about getting a place. Her experience in Chicago proved that she had not tried the right way. There must be people who would listen to and try you -- men who would give you an opportunity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开始考虑该怎样着手去找事做。她在芝加哥的经验证明她以前的找法不对。肯定会有人愿意听你的请求，试用你的。有人会给你一个机会的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carrie became frightened over this announcement. She thought desperately upon the subject. Frequently she had considered the stage as a door through which she might enter that gilded state which she had so much craved. Now, as in Chicago, it came as a last resource in distress. Something must be done if he did not get work soon. Perhaps she would have to go out and battle again alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话让嘉莉感到惊恐了。她苦苦地想着这个问题。她过去常常认为舞台是通向她十分渴望的金色世界的门户。现在，就像在芝加哥一样，舞台又成为她危难之中的最后希望。如果他不能很快找到工作，就必须另想办法。也许她又得出去孤身奋斗了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly the air with which she asked attracted his attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，她问话的神情引起了他的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I think so," he answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我想是这样的，”他回答道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“莫非你还在想着当演员，是吗？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," she answered, "I was just wondering."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”她回答，“我只是搞不懂罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without being clear, there was something in the thought which he objected to. He did not believe any more, after three years of observation, that Carrie would ever do anything great in that line. She seemed too simple, too yielding. His idea of the art was that it involved something more pompous. If she tried to get on the stage she would fall into the hands of some cheap manager and become like the rest of them. He had a good idea of what he meant by THEM. Carrie was pretty. She would get along all right, but where would he be?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也不大清楚为什么，但他对这种想法有些不赞成。观察了三年以后，他不再相信嘉莉会在这一行里有多大的成功。她似乎太单纯、太温顺了。他对戏剧艺术的看法认为艺术包含着某种更为浮夸的东西。倘若她想当演员，就会落入某个卑鄙的经理的手中，变得和那帮人一样。他十分了解他所指的那帮人。嘉莉长得漂亮，她会混得不错，可是他该置身何处呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'd get that idea out of my head, if I were you. It's a lot more difficult than you think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是我是你的话，我就不打这个注意。那比你想的要难得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You did," he answered, seeing that he was arousing opposition, "but Chicago isn't New York, by a big jump."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是演得不错，”他回答，看出他已经激起了反感。“但是芝加哥远远不同于纽约。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You said I did real well in Chicago," she rejoined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可你说过我在芝加哥的演出确实不错，”她反驳说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carrie felt this to contain, in some way, an aspersion upon her ability.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The stage," he went on, "is all right if you can be one of the big guns, but there's nothing to the rest of it. It takes a long while to get up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“演戏这事嘛，”他接着说，“倘若你能成为名角，是不错的，但是对其他人来说就不怎样了。要想成名，得花很长的时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carrie did not answer this at all. It hurt her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对此，嘉莉根本不答理。这话太让她伤心了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I do," he answered. "If I were you I wouldn't think of it. It's not much of a profession for a woman."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我倒是知道的，”他回答，“要是我是你的话，我就不会去想它了。对于女人来说，这可不是个好职业。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I don't know," said Carrie, slightly aroused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，这我可不知道，”嘉莉说，有点激动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a flash, he thought he foresaw the result of this thing. Now, when the worst of his situation was approaching, she would get on the stage in some cheap way and forsake him. Strangely, he had not conceived well of her mental ability. That was because he did not understand the nature of emotional greatness. He had never learned that a person might be emotionally -- instead of intellectually -- great. Avery Hall was too far away for him to look back and sharply remember. He had lived with this woman too long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刹那间，他觉得他已经预见到了这件事的结局。现在，他已临近山穷水尽，而她要通过某种不光彩的途径当上演员，把他抛弃。奇怪的是，他从不往好处去想她的智力。这是因为他不会从本质上理解感情的伟大。他从来就不知道一个人可能会在感情上很伟大，而不是在知识上。阿佛莱会堂已经成为十分遥远的过去，他既不会去回想，也记不清楚了。他和这个女人同居得太久了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's better than going hungry," said Carrie. "If you don't want me to do that, why don't you get work yourself?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这总比挨饿强吧，”嘉莉说，“如果你不要我去演戏，为什么你自己不去找工作呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Curiously this idea soon took hold of Hurstwood. His vanishing sum suggested that he would need sustenance. Why could not Carrie assist him a little until he could get something?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说也奇怪，这个想法很快也占据了赫斯渥的头脑。他那逐渐消失的钱提醒他，需要找点生计了。为什么嘉莉不能帮他一点，直到他找到事做呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, let up," he answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，别说了吧，”他回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The result of this was that she secretly resolved to try. It didn't matter about him. She was not going to be dragged into poverty and something worse to suit him. She could act. She could get something and then work up. What would he say then? She pictured herself already appearing in some fine performance on Broadway; of going every evening to her dressing-room and making up. Then she would come out at eleven o'clock and see the carriages ranged about, waiting for the people. It did not matter whether she was the star or not. If she were only once in, getting a decent salary, wearing the kind of clothes she liked, having the money to do with, going here and there as she pleased, how delightful it would all be. Her mind ran over this picture all the day long. Hurstwood's dreary state made its beauty become more and more vivid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番谈话的结果是她暗暗下了决心，要去试试。这不关他的事。她可不愿意为了迎合他而被拖进贫困，或是更糟的处境。她能演戏。她能找到事做，然后逐步成名。到那时候，他还能说些什么呢？她想象着自己已经在百老汇的某些精彩演出中登台亮相，每天晚上走进自己的化妆室去化妆。然后，她会在11点钟走出戏院，看见四周那些一排排等人的马车。她是否名角并不重要。只要她能干上这一行，拿着像样的薪水，穿着爱穿的衣服，有钱可花，想去哪里就去哪里，这一切该是多么令人快乐！她整天脑子里就想着这些情景。赫斯渥那令人沮丧的处境使得这些情景更加美丽迷人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="赫斯渥眼看着她离去，心里隐约泛起阵阵羞愧，这是男子汉气概迅速衰退的表现。他坐了一会儿，随后觉得无法忍受了。他站起身来，戴上了帽子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While she was waiting to be noticed, the door of the hall bedroom opened and from it issued two very mannish-looking women, very tightly dressed, and wearing white collars and cuffs. After them came a portly lady of about forty-five, light-haired, sharp-eyed, and evidently good-natured. At least she was smiling.</div>
