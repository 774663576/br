<div class="line_en">It is now five years since we called our readers' attention to Hiram's Hospital in the quiet city of Barchester. There is now another matter in Barchester that we wish to comment on. Dr Trefoil, the dean, died yesterday. His only fault was his great age, which is something we all hope to be guilty of. But we consider that this post should now be filled by a much younger man, who has the energy and strength to work for the good of the Church. Mr Obadiah Slope's name has been mentioned to us. He is at present the bishop's chaplain. A better man could hardly be found. He is young, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and, we believe, a truly good man. Such a choice would go far to raise public confidence in the present system of Church appointments, and would show people that, from now on, our Church will not offer easy, well-paid work to elderly, worn-out clergymen.</div>

<div class="line_en">The widow began to think that perhaps the signora's friendship was real. Then another thought came to her -- Mr Arabin was too precious to lose. Even if she felt scorn for the signora and her way of life, perhaps Madeline could help her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寡妇开始觉得，这位内罗尼太太也许是真心实意。接着她又产生了另一个念头——阿拉宾先生是个不可多得的佳偶，绝不能错过。就算她鄙视内罗尼太太和她的生活方式，说不定她还是可以给她帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then, it may become stranger still," said Madeline, turning her own face full on her companion's. "Do you love him, love him with all your heart and soul? Because I can tell you, he loves you, thinks of you and nothing else, is thinking of you now as he attempts to write his sermon for next Sunday's service. What would I not give to be loved in such a way by such a man!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，接下来还可能更怪呢。”马德琳说，直视着自己的谈话对象，“您爱他吗，全心全意地爱他吗？因为我可以告诉您，他爱您，心里只有您一个人，这会儿他在写下个星期天的布道词，心里想的还是您。要是有这样的男人这样爱我，付出什么代价我也愿意！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Bold stood up, speechless, and took the signora's hand. Madeline went on, "What I tell you is God's own truth, and it is for you to use it for your own happiness. But you must not betray me. You know his secret now, and I advise you to use the knowledge. And remember, he is not like other men. You mustn't expect him to come to you with pretty presents, to kneel at your feet and to flatter you. There are plenty of men who do that, but he is not one of them. With him, yes means yes, and no means no. Even if his heart should break, the woman who refuses him once will have refused him for ever. And now, Mrs Bold, I will not keep you. If ever you are a happy wife in that man's house, I and my family will be far away. But I shall expect you to write me one line to say you have forgiven the sins of the Stanhope family."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博尔德太太说不出话来，起身握住了内罗尼太太的手。马德琳接着说：“我跟您说的是上帝的真理，您可以拿它来争取自己的幸福。不过，您一定不能出卖我。您现在知道了他的秘密，我建议您善加利用。还有，记住，他跟别的男人不一样。您千万别指望他带着漂亮的礼物来到您的身旁，卑躬屈膝地讨好您。这样做的男人多得很，但他不会。对他来说，愿意就是愿意，不行就是不行。女人拒绝过他一次，他就会理解为永远地拒绝了他，哪怕他会心碎。好了，博尔德太太，我就不留您了。如果您真的成为了那个男人家里幸福的妻子，那时候我和我的家人也已经远在他乡啦。只不过，希望您到时候能给我捎个信儿，说您已经原谅了斯坦诺普一家的罪过。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor half whispered that she would, and then crept out of the room, down the stairs and out into the open air. The fact that this woman, whom she could never like, knew so much about her and the man she loved, was damaging to her pride.

She was fully determined to follow Madeline's advice; if he ever proposed to her, her "yes" would certainly be "yes".</div>

<div class="line_en">On the following day the signora was in her brightest morning dress, and had a whole group of men around her sofa. The first to come and the last to leave was Mr Arabin, to whom the signora was unusually kind and gentle. Mr Thorne was there too, in his best suit; even a respectable, fifty-year-old gentleman could fall into the signora's trap. There were also a number of eager young clergymen, smaller flies who could not keep away from such a powerful, beautiful spider.</div>
