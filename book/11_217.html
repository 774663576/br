<div class="line_en">In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree. He jumped up and went out.</div>

<div class="line_en">From Frodo's mind the bright morning -- treacherously bright, he thought -- had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and singing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对佛罗多来说，这亮的有些让人不安的晨光并没有赶跑追兵带来的恐惧感。吉尔多的话语在他脑中挥之不去。皮聘欢欣鼓舞的声音传来过来，他正在草地上四处乱跑，随口唱歌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No! I could not!" he said to himself. "It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and weariness may have no cure, is quite another -- even if they are willing to come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don't think I ought even to take Sam." He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain," said Sam. "Don't you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to.

<div class="line_en">Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多有些吃惊的看着山姆，本以为会从外表看出他所经历的改变。这听起来不像是他的老友山姆—詹吉会说的话。但坐在那边的人外表看起来还是山姆—詹吉，只是神情少见的严肃而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now -- now that your wish to see them has come true already?" he asked.</div>

I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want -- I don't rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还是想，大人。我不知道该怎么描述，但经过昨夜之后，我觉得自己改变了。我似乎可以看到未来。我知道我们要朝向黑暗走上很长一段路，但我也知道我不能够回头。真正的目的不是要满足我目睹精灵、巨龙或山川的愿望；我现在其实也不太确定自己要些什么。但我知道自己在一切结束之前该做些什么，而这关键在外面的世界，不在夏尔。如果你明白我的意思，大人，我必须留到最后。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We can cut straighter than the road anyway," answered Frodo. "The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -- you can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But that is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们至少可以找到比较近的路，”佛罗多回答。“渡口就在巨木厅东南边的地方，但这条路往左边弯；前面靠北的地方就是一个转弯。这条路会绕过沼泽地北边，和史塔克上方大桥的岔路接头。这样会多绕好几哩路。如果我们从这里直接往渡口方向走，至少可以省下四分之一的路程。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Short cuts make long delays," argued Pippin. "The country is rough round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish -- I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black Riders, I can't see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘欲速则不达，’”皮聘反驳道。“这里的地形很崎岖，沼泽里到处都有泥沼和各种各样的怪地形；我对这边真的蛮熟的。如果你还担心黑骑士，我不认为在树林、在平原或是在道路上遇到他们会有什么差别。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦！”皮聘说，“我愿意跟随你进入每一个沼泽和泥地中。唉，这段旅途一定会很辛苦的！我预料在天黑前应该可以赶到史塔克的金鲈鱼旅店。最顺口的啤酒都出产在夏尔东区，至少以前是这样的。我已经很久没来品酒啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below. Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left, and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. Then they could make straight for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时的天气几乎已经和昨天一样炎热了；不过，云朵慢慢的开始从西方出现。看起来可能会下雨。哈比人们蹒跚的越过陡峭的山坡，冲进底下浓密的树林中。他们的计划是让巨木厅的方向一直保持在左手边，穿过山丘东边的森林，这样就可以走上接下来平坦的原野。然后，他们可以直接穿过开阔的荒野朝向渡口前进，中间只有一些零散的篱笆和田园而已。佛罗多推算他们大概还必须直线前进十八哩才行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen. They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering what to do. "First check!" said Pippin, smiling grimly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快的就发现这树丛比他想像的要近、要浓密。树底下几乎没有可以通行的空间，披荆斩棘的结果也让他们举步维艰。当他们勉强走到山坡底的时候，他们发现一条从山丘上流下的小溪，两侧的河岸则是又陡又滑，还真的长了许多荆棘。更要命的是，这条小溪正好切过他们所选择的路线。他们跳不过去，如果不想搞的一身湿、沾满泥巴和被刺的千疮百孔，根本是过不了这条小溪。一行人停下脚步，思索着接下来的路线。“到达第一关！”皮聘苦笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. They were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going. The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower, wandering off towards the Marish and the River.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前进可不是件容易的事。他们身上还背着背包，但浓密的树丛和荆棘并没有这么简单放过他们。后面的树木构成了阻碍，挡住了微风，空气变得十分凝滞沉闷。当他们终于挤过重重障碍之后，他们又热又累，身上伤痕累累，甚至连自己身在何方都不太确定。小溪的河岸到了平地之后，变得更宽、更平了些，一路延伸到沼泽地和河的方向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们跋涉过溪，急忙登上远方的一块平地，这里长满了灯心草，没有什么树木。在那块平地之后是一环高大的橡木，其它还有一些榆树和梣树。地面相当的平坦，也没有生长多少植物。但这些树木之间还是太过拥挤，让他们没办法看到前方。一阵突如其来的风将树叶吹了起来，大滴的雨点接着从天空落下。然后风停了下来，暴雨跟着降下。他们尽可能的赶路，踏过厚实的草地、踩过许多落叶；雨滴在他们四周不停的滴达作响。他们不敢互相交谈，一直回头提防、看着四周的动静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but there was no sound of pursuit. "I don't fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank," said Sam. "But I guess he knows we came down it. We had better be going on."</div>

<div class="line_en">After half an hour Pippin said: "I hope we have not turned too much towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not a very broad belt --I should have said no more than a mile at the widest -- and we ought to have been through it by now."</div>

<div class="line_en">They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-day, and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its feel was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they found that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers, and was wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their fingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他们可能又走了几哩路。然后太陽再度从乌云后探出头来，雨势也变小了些。现在早已过了中午，众人都觉得该是吃午餐的好时机。他们在一棵榆树下坐了下来。虽然这棵榆树大部分的叶子都开始变黄了，但还算是相当浓密，树荫附近的地面也算干燥。当他们开始准备午餐的时候，发现精灵们帮他们把瓶子内装满了清澈的金色液体，这香味彷佛是由多种鲜花酿出之蜂蜜，让人感觉神清气爽。很快的，他们就开始轻松的谈笑，对着大雨和黑骑士嗤之以鼻。这时，他们觉得剩下的几哩路应该很快就会过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun escaping from the breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon they came into well-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew nearer; and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在离开森林的庇荫之后，他们一开始觉得十分害怕。他们可以看见身后就是吃早餐时所在的高地。佛罗多担心会看见黑骑士的身影站在那块高地上；不过，他的忧虑并没有成真。缓缓落下的太陽从云朵中探出头来，再度开始照耀大地。恐惧慢慢的消褪，但众人内心仍有一丝不安。脚下的土地变得越来越平坦、似乎经过细心照料。很快的，他们来到了一块有着精心规划的田地和草场的区域；四下有着篱笆、木门和灌溉用的沟渠。一切看起来都十分的安祥宁静，就如同平日夏尔的午后一般。他们的心情逐渐轻松起来。河岸越来越靠近，黑骑士的身影彷佛早已被抛到背后的森林中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，他们就走到了森林的尽头。出现在他们眼前的是一片宽广的草地。他们这才发现方向果然已经太过偏南。在这一片平原的尽头可以看见河对岸是巴寇伯理的低矮山丘；不过，这些山丘现在和原订计划不同，却是出现在他们的左手边。他们蹑手蹑脚的从森林中走出，想要尽快的横越这片毫无遮蔽的平原。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Maggots, and the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane.</div>

The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely.

The largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘将另外两位朋友介绍给老农夫认识。“佛罗多—巴金斯先生，”他说。“你可能不记得他了，但他以前就住在烈酒厅。”老农夫一听见巴金斯这个名字猛地一惊，瞪了佛罗多一眼。佛罗多一时间以为对方又想起了多年前偷蘑菇的事情，开始担心马上就会被恶犬赶出去。但农夫马嘎反而抓住了他的手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went into the farmer's kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously.

<div class="line_en">"Then I'll tell you what to think," said Maggot. "You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up there." Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye. "But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes of those strange doings of Mr. Bilbo's. His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我告诉你该想什么，”马嘎说。“你根本不该去和哈比屯的家伙斯混的，佛罗多先生。那边的家伙都是些怪人。”山姆动了动，用不友善的目光看着马嘎。“不过你从小就是个胆大的家伙。当我听说你离开烈酒鹿家，去和比尔博老先生住在一起的时候，我就觉得你会遇上麻烦。记住我说的话，这一切都是比尔博先生的古怪行径所招惹来的。他们说他的财富都是从远方以奇怪的方式拿到的。就我听说的来看，或许有人想要知道他外地弄来的财宝都埋到哪里去了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped out of the way only just in time.

You'll have friends in these parts. If any of these black fellows come after you again, I'll deal with them. I'll say you're dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like.

One or two other hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while fourteen sat down to eat.
