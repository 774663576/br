<div class="line_en">Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good deal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she refused him. Their affection was always to subside into friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice," said she. -- "In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice.

<div class="line_en">"He is undoubtedly very much in love-every thing denotes it-very much in love indeed! -- and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it. -- It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been so wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and language at parting would have been different. -- Still, however, I must be on my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy. -- His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable. -- Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved. -- I shall do very well again after a little while-and then, it will be a good thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall have been let off easily."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“毫无疑问，他肯定深深地坠人了情网——种种迹象都表明了这一点——真是深深地坠人了情网！等他再来的时候，如果仍旧情意绵绵，那我可得留神，千万不能怂恿他。我既然已经拿定了主意，不这样是绝对不可宽恕的。我倒不是料想他会觉得我一直在怂恿他。不，如果他当真我也对他有意思，他就不会这么怏怏不乐了。他要是觉得我在怂恿他的话，临别时就会是另一副神情，另一番言谈。然而，我还是得留神。这是假定他还像现在这样对我情深意浓，不过我也说不准他是不是会这样。我看他不是那种人——我根本不指望他会坚定不移，忠贞不渝。他的感情是热烈的，但是可以想象也是多变的。总之，经过左思右，我觉得自己没把幸福过多地寄托在他身上，是值得庆幸的。我很快就会恢复正常的——到那时，这又会成为一件好事了，因为据说人人一生都要坠人情网一次，我会轻而易举地解脱出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety. -- The charm of her own name was not wanting. Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus to her." This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was remembered only from being her friend. His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯顿太太收到弗兰克的来信以后，爱玛也看了这封信，而且是带着几分欣喜和赞赏之情看的，因此不由得摇起头来，对自己的感情表示惊异，觉得自己以前低估了那些感情的力量。那是一封长信，写得很出色，详细述说了他一路上的情况、心里的感受，表达了满怀的爱慕和感激，以及自然而真挚的敬重之情，描绘了当地和外地种种有趣的事情，笔调准确而生动。信里没有令人生疑的表示抱歉和关切的华丽词藻，有的只是向韦斯顿太太表达真情实意的语句。他从海伯里回到恩斯库姆，两地在社交生活方面的主要差异，只是略带了几笔，但也足以表明他的感触有多深，若不是由于拘于礼仪，他还可以多写多少内容啊。信里自然少不了她的芳名，不止一次地见到“伍德豪斯小姐”，而且每次都能引起愉快的联想，不是称赞她情趣高雅，就是回忆她说过什么话。她最后一次见到自己的名字时，虽然写得朴实无华，丝毫没有献殷勤的意味，但是却能看出她的举足轻重，意识到这也许是对她最大的恭维。在信笺最下方的空白处，密密麻麻地写了这样两行字：“你知道，我星期二那天抽不出空来去向伍德豪斯小姐的那位美丽的小朋友辞别。请代我表示歉意，并向她告别。”爱玛毫不怀疑，这完全是为了她而写的。他所以惦着哈丽特，仅仅因为她是她爱玛的朋友。他所描绘的恩斯库姆的现状和前景，跟她预料的差不多。邱吉尔太太正在康复，他还不敢说什么时候能再来兰多尔斯，甚至连想都不敢想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I must not dwell upon it," said she. --"I must not think of it. I know the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不能多想这件事了，”她心想。“我不能再想下去了。我知道这样胡思乱想是危险的。不过，比这更奇怪的事情还有呢。现在我们已经不再两心相悦了，这倒可以促使我们稳固地建立一种真正无私的友情，我已经在乐滋滋地企盼这种友情了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her. Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words which clothed it, the "beautiful little friend," suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was it impossible? -- No. -- Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour. -- For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽这封信的主要内容，也就是所表达的情感，使她感到得意，受到鼓舞，然而等她把信叠好还给韦斯顿太太时，却发觉它并未激起丝毫持久的热情，没有了这个写信人，她还可以照样生活，而他也该学会没有她而照样生活。她没有改变初衷。她好了一个主意，以使他以后获得安慰和幸福，因而越发坚定了拒绝他的决心。他还惦着哈丽特，称她为“美丽的小朋友”，这就启发她生出这样一个念头：她拒绝他以后，他可以继而去爱哈丽特。难道不可能吗？不能这么说。毫无疑问，哈丽特在见识上远远比不上他，不过她那妩媚动人的脸蛋、热烈纯真的举止，却使他为之着迷。而且从家庭出身和社会关系来看，她可能具有很优越的条件呢。这件事要是办成了，对于哈丽特来说，真是又有利又可喜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form. -- His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before "Mr. Elton and his bride" was in every body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength. With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach-new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened submissively, and said "it was very true -- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described-it was not worth while to think about them-and she would not think about them any longer" but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.

These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very important-and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.
