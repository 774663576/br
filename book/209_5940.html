<div class="line_en">MR. BENNET'S property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="班纳特先生的全部家当几乎都在一宗产业上，每年可以借此获得两千磅的收入。说起这宗产业，真是他女儿们的不幸。他因为没有儿子，产业得由一个远亲来继承，至于她们母亲的家私，在这样的人家本来也算得上一笔大数目，事实上却还不够补他的损失。班纳特太太的父亲曾经在麦里屯当过律师，给了她四千英镑的遗产。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浪博恩这个村子和麦里屯相隔只有一英里路，这么一段距离对于那几位年轻的小姐们是再便利不过的了，她们每星期总得上那儿在三四次，看看她们的姨母，还可以顺便看看那边一家卖女人帽子的商店。两个最小的妹妹咖苔琳和丽迪雅特别倾心于这方面，她们比姐姐们心事要少得多，每当没有更好的消遣办法时，就必定到麦里屯走一遭，消遣消遣美好的晨光，并且晚上也就有了谈助。尽管这村子里通常没有什么新闻可以打听，她们还老是千方百计地从她们姨妈那儿打听到一些。附近地方最近开到了一团民兵，她们的消息来源当然从此就丰富了，真叫她们高兴非凡。这一团人要在这儿驻扎整个冬天，麦里屯就是司令部的所在地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咖苔琳一听此话，颇感不安，可是并没有回答。丽迪雅却完全没有把爸爸的话当一回事，还是接着说下去，说她自己多么爱慕卡特上尉，还希望当天能够跟他见面，因为他明天上午就要到伦敦去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed, "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早晨，班纳特先生听到她们滔滔不绝地谈到这个问题，他不禁冷言冷语地说：“看你们谈话的神气，我觉得你们真是些再蠢不过的女孩子。以前我不过半信半疑，现在我可完全相信了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从此她们每次拜访腓力普太太都获得了最有趣的消息。她们每天都会打听到几个军官的名字和他们的社会关系。军官们的住宅不久就让大家知道了，再后来小姐们就直接跟他们搞熟了，腓力普先生一一拜访了那些军官，这真是替她的姨侄女们开辟了一道意想不到的幸福源泉。她们现在开口闭口都离不开那些军官。在这以前，只要提到彬格莱先生的偌大财产，她们的母亲就会眉飞色舞，如今跟军官们的制服对比起来，她们就觉得偌大的财产简直一钱不值了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. -- When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."</div>

<div class="line_en">"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.

<div class="line_en">Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她问起姐姐的病情如何，可没有得到满意的回答。据说班纳特小姐晚上睡不好，现在虽然已经起床，热度却很高，不能出房门。使伊丽莎白高兴的是，他们马上就把她领到她姐姐那儿去。吉英看到她来，非常高兴，原来她为了不愿意让家里人着急和麻烦，所以信里并没有说明她极其盼望有个亲人来看看她。可是她没有力气多说话，因此，当彬格莱小姐走开以后，剩下她们姐妹俩在一块儿的时候，她只说到她们这儿待她太好了，使她非常感激───除了这些话以外，就没有再说什么。伊丽莎白静悄悄地等候着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. -- That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. -- Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她被领进了餐厅，只见他们全家人都在那儿，只有吉英不在场。她一走进门就引起全场人的惊奇。赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐心想，这么一大早，路上又这么泥泞，她竟从三英里路开外赶到这儿来，而且是独个儿赶来的，这事情简直叫人无法相信。伊丽莎白料定她们瞧不起她这种举动。不过事实上她们倒很客气地接待了她，特别是她们的兄弟，不仅是客客气气接待她，而且非常殷勤多礼。达西先生说话不多，赫斯脱先生完全一言不发。达西先生的心里被两种情感弄得七上八下：一方面爱慕她那步行之后的鲜艳的脸色，另方面又怀疑她是否值得为了这么点儿事情独个儿打那么远赶来。至于赫斯脱先生，他一心一意只想要吃早饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正三点的时候，伊丽莎白觉得应该走了，于是勉强向主人家告别。彬格莱小姐要她乘着马车回去，她正打算稍许推辞一下就接受主人的盛意，不料吉英说是舍不得让她走，于是彬格莱小姐便不得不改变了请她坐马车回去的主意，请她在尼日斐花园小住一阵。伊丽莎白感激不尽地答应了。接下来就是差人上浪博恩去，把她在这儿暂住的事情告诉她家里一声，同时叫她家里给她带些衣服来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters, and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早饭吃过以后，彬格莱家的姐妹也来陪伴她们，伊丽莎白看到她们对吉英那么亲切和祥，便不禁对她们有了好感。医生来检查了病人的症状，说她是重伤风（其实这也是可想而知的），他嘱咐她们要尽力当心，又劝吉英上床去睡觉，并且给她开了几样药。医生的嘱呼立刻照办了，因为病人热度又高了一些，而且头痛得很厉害。伊丽莎白片刻也没有离开她的房间，另外两位小姐也不大走开；男客们都不在家里，其实他们在家里也帮不了什么忙。">查看中文翻译</div>
