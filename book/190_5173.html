<div class="line_en">They were happy days, while Oliver was getting better. He played cards with Mrs Bed win and listened to stories about her family. The days were all so quiet and relaxing, after the hardships and poverty of his previous life. Mr Brown low bought him a new suit and new shoes, and Oliver's dirty old clothes were given away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver went in and sat down. He looked at Mr Brown low 's serious face in alarm. "Don't tell me you're going to send me away, sir, please!" he exclaimed. "Let me stay here! I could help with the housework… please, sir!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥利弗走进书房坐定，他看看布朗洛满脸的严肃劲，惊慌起来。“先生，请别把我送走！”他惊叫着。“让我留在这儿！我能帮着干家务活……先生，求求您了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oliver began to recover and slowly regain his strength. The picture that had caused Mr Brown low 's excitement was taken down from the wall, and was not mentioned again. Oliver was disappointed at the disappearance of the picture, since he liked the woman's face, but he had many other things to think about now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥利弗慢慢地恢复了，气力也恢复了。那幅挂在墙上使布朗洛先生激动不已的画像被拿了下来，也不再被任何人提起了。画像的消失使奥利弗很失望，因为他很喜欢照片上女人的面貌，不过，现在他有许多别的事要想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear child, don't be afraid," said Mr Brown low kindly. "I won't desert you. I believe that you're a good boy, not a common thief. You told me you're an orphan -- that seems to be the truth. But I want to hear now the whole story of your life, and how you came to be with the boys I saw you with that day."</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver bowed politely and was introduced by Mr Brown low. Tea was then brought in, and during the meal Mr Grimwig stared so hard at Oliver that the boy felt rather confused. Eventually, Mr Grimwig whispered to Mr Brown low, "He may be a good-looking boy, but I think he's deceiving you, my good friend,"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥利弗有礼貌地给他鞠了躬，并由布朗洛先生作了介绍。然后用人递上了茶点，喝茶时格里姆威格先生死死盯着奥利弗，使这孩子感到非常不自在。终于，格里姆威格先生凑近布朗洛先生，小声地说：“这孩子可能算是长相不错，但我想他是在欺骗你呢，我的好朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oliver began his story but was soon interrupted by the arrival of Mr Grimwig, an old friend of Mr Brown low's. Mr Grimwig was a fierce old gentleman and very fond of arguments. He clearly knew all about Oliver and inspected him closely.</div>
