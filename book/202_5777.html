<div class="line_en">The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron's prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man's sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen, she started.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I'm sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!" said Mrs. Weasley.

This did not help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，坦白地说，我认为亚瑟和我有权知道，而且我相信格兰杰夫妇也会赞同！”韦斯莱夫人说。哈利早就担心“家长”的杀手锏。他强迫自己直盯着韦斯莱夫人的眼睛，却发现它们是和金妮的眼睛完全一样的褐色。这也于事无补。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't see that you have to go either!" she snapped, dropping all pretense now. "You're barely of age, any of you!

Well, Harry, while we've still got you here, you won't mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur's wedding, will you? There's still so much to do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，当然不是，”韦斯莱夫人突然又恢复了她那轻松随意的口气，令哈利感到不知所措，“我应该想到的。好了，哈利，既然你还待在我们这里，你不会反对帮着操办一下比尔和芙蓉的婚礼吧？要做的事情还很多呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapés, however, Harry started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那时候起，韦斯莱夫人就让哈利、罗恩和赫敏为筹备婚礼忙得团团转，几乎没有时间想事情，对这种行为最宽容的解释是，韦斯莱夫人想分散他们的注意力，不让他们想着疯眼汉和最近那次惊险的旅行。经过两天没完没了地擦洗餐具，给礼品、丝带和鲜花搭配颜色，清除花园里的地精，又帮韦斯莱夫人烤了一大堆开胃薄饼，哈利开始怀疑她另有动机。她分派的活似乎都让他、罗恩和赫敏互相分开。自从第一天夜里哈利告诉罗恩和赫敏伏地魔在折磨奥利凡德之后，便再也没有机会与他们俩单独说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters.

"So we're going to put out the story that I'm seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can't go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit's really contagious, so they're not going to want to go near him. It won't matter that he can't say anything, either, because apparently you can't once the fungus has spread to your uvula."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不可能把我们全家都藏起来，那样太可疑，而且他们不可能都不工作呀，”罗恩说，“所以我们要放出风去，说我患了严重的散花痘，不能回学校了。如果有人上门调查，爸爸或妈妈可以让他们看我床上满脸脓疱的食尸鬼。散花痘传染性很强，他们肯定不愿意靠近它。它不会说话也不要紧，因为真菌蔓延到小舌头上，肯定说不出话来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more… to find out everything…</div>

<div class="line_en">The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利从没见过院子显得这么整洁。平常散落在后门台阶上的锈坩埚和旧雨靴都不见了，取而代之的是两株新栽在大盆里的振翅灌木，门的两边各放一盆。虽然没有风，但叶子懒洋洋地舞动着，形成一种迷人的、微波涟漪的效果。鸡都关起来了，院子也清扫过了，近旁的花园都修剪装扮一新。不过哈利还是喜欢它蓬勃疯长的状态，觉得少了平常那些跳来跳去的地精，显得怪冷清的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur's mother.</div>

Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids' shoes "Charmant!" Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And, of course, you "ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!" said Monsieur Delacour.

Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour's protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy's old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.</div>
