<div class="line_en">"My dear sister and very good Lady," said King Edmund, "you must now show your courage. For I tell you plainly we are in no small danger."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What is it, Edmund asked the Queen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“究竟怎么回事，爱德蒙？”女王问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is this," said Edmund. "I do not think we shall find it easy to leave Tashbaan. While the Prince had hope that you would take him, we were honoured guests. But by the Lion's Mane, I think that as soon as he has your flat denial we shall be no better than prisoners."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“事情是这样的，”爱德蒙说，“我并不认为离开塔什班城是轻而易举的。王子希望你会看中他时，我们是他的贵宾；然而，凭狮王的鬓毛起誓，一旦他遭到你干脆的拒绝，我想我们的处境就不会比囚徒好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have been with the Prince this morning," continued Edmund. "He is little used (more's the pity) to having his will crossed. And he is very chafed at your long delays and doubtful answers. This morning he pressed very hard to know your mind. I put it aside-meaning at the same time to diminish his hopes -- with some light common jests about women's fancies, and hinted that his suit was likely to be cold. He grew angry and dangerous. There was a sort of threatening, though still veiled under a show of courtesy, in every word he spoke."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今天上午我曾同王子在一起。尤为遗憾的是，”爱德蒙继续说道，“他是不习惯于自己的意愿受到拂逆的。对你的长期拖延和含糊其辞的答复，他是十分焦躁恼怒的。今天上午他咄咄逼人地要知道你的心意。我把这问题撇在一边——同时也想削弱他的希望——只说些关于女人的幻想之类轻松平常的笑话，暗示他的求婚大概要冷下来了。他就变得愤怒而有所威胁了。他说的每句话，尽管仍旧蒙着彬彬有礼的面纱，却都包含着恐吓的意味。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But how can he? Does the Tisroc think our brother the High King would suffer such an outrage?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是他怎么能这样呢？难道蒂斯罗克认为我们的哥哥至尊王会容忍这种凌辱人的暴行吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Tumnus. "And when I supped with the Grand Vizier last night, it was the same. He asked me how I like Tashbaan. And I (for I could not tell him I hated every stone of it and I would not lie) told him that now, when high summer was coming on, my heart turned to the cool woods and dewy slopes of Narnia. He gave a smile that meant no good and said, `There is nothing to hinder you from dancing there again, little goatfoot; always provided you leave us in exchange a bride for our prince."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”图姆纳斯说道，“昨夜我和大臣共进晚餐时，情况也差不多。他问我可喜欢塔什班城。而我（因为我无法告诉他我憎恨城里每一块石头，却又不肯说谎）告诉他，如今盛夏来，我的心便向往着纳尼亚的清凉树林和露珠晶莹的山坡。他不怀好意地微微一笑，说道，小小羊脚啊，没有东西会阻止你重新在纳尼亚跳舞；你永远可以那么做，作为交换条件，只要你给我们的王子留下一个新娘就行了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sire," said Peridan to the King. "They would not be so mad. Do they think there are no swords and spears in Narnia?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，”珀里丹对国王说道，“他们不会那么疯狂。难道他们认为纳尼亚王国没有剑和长矛吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alas," said Edmund. "My guess is that the Tisroc has very small fear of Narnia. We are a little land. And little lands on the borders of a great empire were always hateful to the lords of the great empire. He longs to blot them out, gobble them up. When first he suffered the Prince to come to Cair Paravel as your lover, sister, it may be that he was only seeking an occasion against us. Most likely he hopes to make one mouthful of Narnia and Archenland both."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，”爱德蒙说，“我的猜想是蒂斯罗克对纳尼亚王国没有什么畏惧。我们的国土小。而小邦小国位于大帝国的边缘，对大帝国的君主总是憎恨的。蒂斯罗克一心要把它们抹掉，要把它们吞并掉。他最初让他的王子作为你的爱慕者到凯尔帕维尔来，也许只是想找个机会借端反对我们。很可能他指望一口就把纳尼亚和阿钦兰两个国家都吞并掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let him try," said the second Dwarf. "At sea we are as big as he is. And if he assaults us by land, he has the desert to cross."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让他试试吧，”第二个小矮人说道，“我们在海上跟他一般儿强大。如果他从陆地进攻，他就得穿过大沙漠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"True, friend," said Edmund. "But is the desert a sure defence? What does Sallowpad say?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，朋友，”爱德蒙说，“但大沙漠是个可靠的屏障吗？萨罗帕德你怎么看？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know that desert well," said the Raven. "For I have flown above it far and wide in my younger days," (you may be sure that Shasta pricked up his ears at this point). "And this is certain; that if the Tisroc goes by the great oasis he can never lead a great army across it into Archenland. For though they could reach the oasis by the end of their first day's march, yet the springs there would be too little for the thirst of all those soldiers and their beasts. But there is another way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很了解这个大沙漠，”渡鸦说道，“在我年轻的岁月里，我曾在大沙漠上空飞翔得又远又广。”（你一定深信沙斯塔听到这里时竖起了耳朵。）“有一点是无可置疑的：如果蒂斯罗克从大绿洲进军，他永远不可能率领一支庞大的军队进入阿钦兰。因为，尽管他们在第一天急行军之后可以到达绿洲，但那儿的泉水太少了，不足以给所有的士兵和牲口解渴。但还有另外一条路径。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shasta listened more attentively still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔一动也不动，更加注意地静听着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He that would find that way," said the Raven, "must start from the Tombs of the Ancient Kings and ride northwest so that the double peak of Mount Pire is always straight ahead of him. And so, in a day's riding or a little more, he shall come to the head of a stony valley, which is so narrow that a man might be within a furlong of it a thousand times and never know that it was there. And looking down this valley he will see neither grass nor water nor anything else good. But if he rides on down it he will come to a river and can ride by the water all the way into Archenland."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要找到这条路径的人，”渡鸦说道，“必须从古代国王的坟场出发，骑马朝西北驰去，皮尔峰的双峰便始终在他的正前方。如此骑马走上一天或稍稍再多一点儿时间，他就来到一个石头山谷的入口处，那个地方是那么狭窄，以致一个人可以上千次离它二百米光景，却不知道它就在那儿。向山谷里望下去，他既看不到青草或水，也看不到任何好东西。但如果他继续骑马前进，跑下山谷去，他就会来到一条河流边上，他可以沿着河流驰去，一路直达阿钦兰境内。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Friends, friends," said Edmund, "what is the use of all this discourse? We are not asking whether Narnia or Calormen would win if war arose between them. We are asking how to save the honour of the Queen and our own lives out of this devilish city. For though my brother, Peter the High King, defeated the Tisroc a dozen times over, yet long before that day our throats would be cut and the Queen's grace would be the wife, or more likely, the slave, of this prince."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朋友们，朋友们，”爱德蒙说，“这一切讨论有什么用处？我们不是在问如果纳尼亚王国和卡乐门王国之间发生战争，哪一个国家会获得胜利。我们要问的是：如何挽救女王的荣誉，以及如何从这魔鬼的城市里救出我们自己的生命？因为，就算我的哥哥至尊王彼得会把蒂斯罗克打败十多次，然而早在这一天之前，我们的脖子已经被砍断了，而女王却成了这位王子的妻子，或者更可能是成了他的奴隶。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“至于这一点，”国王说，“我毫不怀疑，我们每一个人都会在门口拼命，叫敌人付出沉重的代价，除非从我们的尸体上跨过去，他们休想侵犯女王。然而我们毕竟不过是老鼠在陷阱里搏斗罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is perfectly dreadful," thought Shasta. It never came into his head to tell these Narnians the whole truth and ask for their help. Having been brought up by a hard, closefisted man like Arsheesh, he had a fixed habit of never telling grown-ups anything if he could help it: he thought they would always spoil or stop whatever you were trying to do. And he thought that even if the Narnian King might be friendly to the two horses, because they were Talking Beasts of Narnia, he would hate Aravis, because she was a Calormene, and either sell her for a slave or send her back to her father. As for himself, "I simply dn't tell them I'm not Prince Corin now," thought Shasta. "I've heard all their plans. If they knew I wasn't one of themselves, they'd never let me out of this house alive. They'd be afraid I'd betray them to the Tisroc. They'd kill me. And if the real Corin turns up, it'll all come out, and they will!" He had, you see, no idea of how noble and free-born people behave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这情况万分可怕。”沙斯塔心中想道。他脑子里从来没有想过要把全部真相告诉纳尼亚人，要求他们的帮助。他从小是由一个像阿什伊什那样心肠硬、拳头大的人带大的，养成了一个固定不变的习惯，如果他想得出办法，他就什么也不告诉成年人，他认为成年人总是破坏或阻挠他正在试图干的事情的。而且他认为：即使纳尼亚国王会友好对待两匹马儿，因为它们是纳尼亚的说人话的牲口，他也会憎恨阿拉维斯，因为她是个卡乐门人，他若不把她当做奴隶卖掉，也会把她送回她父亲那儿去。至于他自己呢，“我现在简直不敢告诉他们：我并不是王子科林。”沙斯塔想道，“我已经听到了他们的全部计划，如果他们知道我并不是纳尼亚王族一员，他们就决不会让我活着走出这个房间。他们会担心我把他们出卖给蒂斯罗克的。如果真正的科林出现了，事情就拆穿了，他们就一定会把我宰了！”你瞧，他对于高尚而天生自由的人们如何立身行事，脑子里是毫无概念的。">查看中文翻译</div>

There is no need for you to move until we are all ready to embark."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a fine meal after the Calormene fashion. I don't know whether you would have liked it or not, but Shasta did. There were lobsters, and salad, and snipe stuffed with almonds and truffles, and a complicated dish made of chickenlivers and rice and raisins and nuts, and there were cool melons and gooseberry fools and mulberry fools, and every kind of nice thing that can be made with ice. There was also a little flagon of the sort of wine that is called "white" though it is really yellow.</div>

<div class="line_en">While Shasta was eating, the good little Faun, who thought he was still dazed with sunstroke, kept talking to him about the fine times he would have when they all got home; about his good old father King Lune of Archenland and the little castle where he lived on the southern slopes of the pass. "And don't forget," said Mr Tumnus, "that you are promised your first suit of armour and your first war horse on your next birthday. And then your Highness will begin to learn how to tilt and joust. And in a few years, if all goes well, King Peter has promised your royal father that he himself will make you Knight at Cair Paravel. And in the meantime there will be plenty of comings and goings between Narnia and Archenland across the neck of the mountains. And of course you remember you have promised to come for a whole week to stay with me for the Summer Festival, and there'll be bonfires and all-night dances of Fauns and Dryads in the heart of the woods and, who knows?-we might see Aslan himself!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Shasta had so enjoyed his dinner and all the things Tumnus had been telling him that when he was left alone his thoughts took a different turn. He only hoped now that the real Prince Corin would not turn up until it was too late and that he would be taken away to Narnia by ship. I am afraid he did not think at all of what might happen to the real Corin when he was left behind in Tashbaan. He was a little worried about Aravis and Bree waiting for him at the Tombs. But then he said to himself, "Well, how can I help it?" and, "Anyway, that Aravis thinks she's too good to go about with me, so she can jolly well go alone," and at the same time he couldn't help feeling that it would be much nicer going to Narnia by sea than toiling across the desert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正餐和图姆纳斯告诉他的一切事情，沙斯塔都十分欣赏，留下他一个人在房间里时，他的思想发生了截然不同的转向和变化。他现在只是希望真正的王子科林迟迟不会到来，这样他就可以坐在船上被带到纳尼亚去了。恐怕他压根儿没想一想：真正的科林给丢在塔什班城会碰到什么危险。他稍稍有点儿为在坟场上等候他的阿拉维斯和布里担心。但他接着又跟自己说道，“哎，我又有什么办法呢？”以及，“无论如何，那个阿拉维斯认为她跟我混在一起是太抬举我了，现在她可以高高兴兴地一个人走了。”同时，他又禁不住想道；辛辛苦苦穿过大沙漠，远不如从海上坐船到纳尼亚去舒服哩。+">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the meal was over the Faun told Shasta to stay quietly where he was. "And it wouldn't do you any harm to have a little sleep," he added. "I'll call you in plenty of time to get on board. And then, Home. Narnia and the North!"</div>

He fell asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shasta had never seen his own face in a looking-glass. Even if he had, he might not have realized that the other boy was (at ordinary times) almost exactly like himself. At the moment this boy was not particularly like anyone for he had the finest black eye you ever saw, and a tooth missing, and his clothes (which must have been splendid ones when he put them on) were torn and dirty, and there was both blood and mud on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔从未在镜子里看见过他自己的脸。即使他看见过，他也看不出（在平常时候）这个孩子几乎长得跟他自己一模一样。而此时此刻，这孩子可并不特别像其他任何人，因为他长着你见过的最美丽的黑眼睛，掉了一个牙齿，而他的衣服（他穿上身时是挺华丽的）破破烂烂、肮肮脏脏，他脸上既有血又有污泥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What woke him was a loud crash. He jumped up off the sofa, staring. He saw at once from the mere look of the room -- the lights and shadows all looked different -- that he must have slept for several hours. He saw also what had made the crash: a costly porcelain vase which had been standing on the window-sill lay on -the floor broken into about thirty pieces. But he hardly noticed all these things. What he did notice was two hands gripping the window-sill from outside. They gripped harder and harder (getting white at the knuckles) and then up came a head and a pair of shoulders. A moment later there was a boy of Shasta's own age sitting astride the sill with one leg hanging down inside the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="响亮的啪啦一声把他惊醒了。他从沙发上跳起身来，瞪着眼睛直瞧。仅仅从房间里的情形——光和影截然不同了——看来，他立刻明白他必定已经睡了好几个钟头。他也弄明白了是什么弄出啪啦声来的：原来放在窗台上的一个珍贵瓷瓶，在地板上碎成了三十片光景。但他没注意这些事情。他注意的是两只从外边抓住窗台的手。双手愈抓愈紧（指关节都发白了），接着就冒出来一个脑袋和一副肩膀。一会儿以后，便有一个年龄同沙斯塔相仿的孩子跨在窗台上了，一条腿已经伸在房间里面了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A boy in the street made a beastly joke about Queen Susan," said Prince Corin, "so I knocked him down. He ran howling into a house and his big brother came out. So I knocked the big brother down. Then they all followed me until we ran into three old men with spears who are called the Watch. So I fought the Watch and they knocked me down. It was getting dark by now. Then the Watch took me along to lock me up somewhere. So I asked them if they'd like a stoup of wine and they said they didn't mind if they did. Then I took them to a wine shop and got them some and they all sat down and drank till they feel asleep. I thought it was time for me to be off so I came out quietly and then I found the first boy -- the one who had started all the trouble -- still hanging about. So I knocked him down again. After that I climbed up a pipe on to the roof of a house and lay quiet till it began to get light this morning. Ever since that I've been finding my way back. I say, is there anything to drink?"</div>
