<div class="line_en">Edward Henry Machin first saw daylight on the 27th of May, 1867, in Brougham Street in Bursley, the oldest of the Five Towns. Brougham Street goes down a hill to the canal, and contains a number of potbanks or pottery factories as well as some small houses. The rent for one of these houses was not high -- only about twenty-three pence a week.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward Henry's mother (his father was dead) lived by making and washing clothes for fine ladies. She did not often laugh, and if you tried to argue with her, you never got very far. She was a woman of few words, and saved time every day by calling her son Denry, instead of Edward Henry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华·亨利的母亲（他的父亲已经去世）靠给时髦贵妇缝制和清洗衣服为生。她不怎么爱笑，即使是想和她争吵，也休想吵得起来。她是个沉默寡言的人，管儿子叫邓瑞，而不是爱德华·亨利，这样每天就节约点时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Denry did not work hard at school, and boys who were lazy and not very clever usually just found jobs in the potbanks. Luckily, at the age of twelve, he won a place at the best school in Bursley. It happened like this. On the second day of the examination, Denry arrived a little early. As he walked around the examination room, he came to the teacher's desk, where he saw a list of names with the marks for the first day of the examination. The highest possible mark was thirty, but next to his name he saw the number 7. The numbers were written in pencil, and the pencil was on the desk. He picked it up, looked around the empty room, and at the door, and then wrote a 2 in front of the 7. Of course, this was not honest, but how many truly honest schoolboys are there? Denry was no worse than most of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓瑞在学校不好好念书。那些既懒惰又不算太聪明的男孩们一般会在陶瓷厂找份活儿干。幸运的是，邓瑞在12岁那年进了伯斯利当地最好的一所学校。事情是这样的：考试的第二天，邓瑞到得比较早，就在考场里四处溜达，然后就走到了讲台那儿。讲台上有一份名单，写着学生的名字和第一天的考试成绩。满分是30分，可他名字后的分数只有7分。分数是用铅笔写的，而铅笔就在讲台上。他拿起铅笔，扫了眼空荡荡的考场，又看了看门口，然后在7前面加了一个2。这样做当然不够诚实，但又有几个真正诚实的学生呢？邓瑞也不比他们中的大多数人坏到哪儿去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Denry was sixteen, his mother made a very fine dress for Mr Duncalf's sister. Mr Duncalf was the most important lawyer in Bursley. His sister was grateful to Mrs Machin, and so Denry got a job in Mr Duncalf's office. For several years Denry was happy. Then he met the Countess.</div>

The mayor and his wife had decided to have a ball and to invite all the most important people in the town.

<div class="line_en">She was gone. It was the first time Denry had seen the Countess, and she was even more beautiful than her photographs. And so easy to talk to! He started looking at her list of names, and he had a fantastic idea. He could go to the ball himself. The Countess had made a list of people to invite, but she had asked four or five other people for lists as well. She wanted Mr Duncalf to put the lists together and send the invitations. Of course the work was given to Denry, so it was easy to add E. H. Machin to the list. On Wednesday Denry received his invitation, and on Thursday he accepted it.</div>
