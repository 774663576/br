<div class="line_en">Tonya stood at the open window and pensively surveyed the familiar garden bordered by the stately poplars now stirring faintly in the gentle breeze. She could hardly believe that a whole year had passed since she had been here where her childhood years had been spent. It seemed that she had left home only yesterday and returned by this morning's train.</div>

<div class="line_en">She picked up the novel she had been reading, opened the door leading to the veranda and walked down the stairs into the garden; she pushed open the little painted wicket gate and slowly headed for the pond next to the station pump house.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing had changed: the rows of raspberry bushes were as carefully trimmed as ever, and the garden paths, lined with pansies, mother's favourite flowers, were laid out with the same geometric precision. Everything in the garden was neat and tidy -- evidence of the pedantic hand of the dendrologist. The sight of these clean-swept, neatly drawn paths bored Tonya.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里什么都没有变样：依然是一排排修剪得整整齐齐的树莓，依然是按几何图形布局的小径，两旁种着妈妈喜爱的蝴蝶花。花园里的一切都是那样干净利落。处处都显示出一个学究式的林学家的匠心。但是这些干净的、图案似的小径却使冬妮亚感到乏味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A girl in a white sailor blouse with a striped blue collar and a short light-grey skirt stood on the bank, holding on to the willow and bending low over the water. Short socks with a coloured edging clung to her shapely suntanned legs. Her chestnut hair was gathered in a heavy braid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看见一个陌生的姑娘站在那里，手扶着柳树，身子探向水面。她穿着领子上有蓝条的白色水兵服和浅灰色短裙。一双带花边的短袜紧紧裹住晒黑了的匀称的小腿，脚上穿着棕色的便鞋。栗色的头发梳成一条粗大的辫子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leaning over the trunk of a twisted willow, she parted the branches and saw before her a suntanned, barefoot boy with trouser legs rolled up above the knee. Next to him was a rusty can with worms. The lad was too engrossed in his occupation to notice her.</div>

<div class="line_en">From above came the mocking voice: "Your black looks have scared the fish away long ago. No self-respecting angler goes fishing in the afternoon anyway!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not much chance to fish now, damn it! What the devil brought her here," Pavel thought irritably and in order to cover up his clumsiness cast the hook farther out, landing it, however, exactly where he should not have -- between two burdocks where the line could easily get caught.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这回还能钓个屁！真是活见鬼，跑来这么个人。”保尔恼火地想。为了掩饰自己的笨拙，他把钓钩甩到更远的水里。钓钩落在两支牛蒡的中间，这里恰恰是不应当下钓的地方，因为鱼钩可能挂到牛蒡根上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pavel had done his best to behave politely but this was too much for him. He got up and pushed his cap over his eyes, as he usually did when roused. "You'd do better, miss, if you took yourself off," he muttered through his teeth, drawing on the most inoffensive part of his vocabulary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="保尔竭力保持礼貌，可是对方未免太过分了。他站起身来，把帽子扯到前额上——这向来是他生气的表示——尽量挑选最客气的字眼，说：“小姐，您还是靠边呆着去，好不好？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You can stay and watch, if you want to. It's all the same to me," he said grudgingly and sat down to attend to the float again. It had got stuck in the burdock and there was no doubt that the hook had caught in the roots. Pavel was afraid to pull at it. If it caught he would not be able to get it loose. And the girl would be sure to laugh. He wished she would go away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也没什么，您要是愿意看，就看好了，我并不是舍不得地方给您坐。”说完，他坐了下来，重新看他的鱼漂。鱼漂紧贴着牛蒡不动，显然是鱼钩挂在根上了。保尔不敢起钓，心里嘀咕着：“钩要是挂上，就摘不下来了。这位肯定要笑话我。她要是走掉该多好！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Caught, damn it!" flashed in his mind and at the same moment he saw out of the corner of his eye the laughing face of the girl looking up at him from the water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tonya, however, had settled more comfortably on the slightly swaying willow trunk and with her book on her knees was watching the sun-tanned, dark-eyed, rough-mannered young man who had given her such an ungracious reception and was now deliberately ignoring her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，冬妮亚却在一棵微微摇摆的弯曲的柳树上，坐得更舒适了。她把书放在膝盖上，看着这个晒得黝黑的、黑眼睛的孩子，他先是那样不客气地对待她，现在又故意不理睬她，真是个粗野的家伙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pavel saw the girl clearly reflected in the mirror-like surface of the pond, and when she seemed to be absorbed in her book he cautiously pulled at the entangled line. The float ducked under the water and the line grew taut.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now this girl is a peach, there's nobody like her about here," Sukharko was saying, winking significantly as he bent toward his companion. "You can take my word for it that she's chock-full of r-r-romance. She's in the sixth grade and goes to school in Kiev. Now she's come to spend the summer with her father -- he's the chief forest warden here. My sister Liza knows her. I wrote her a letter once in a sentimental sort of vein. 'I love you madly'-- you know the sort of thing --'and await your answer in trepidation'. Even dug up some suitable verses from Nadson."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏哈里科侧过身子，朝维克托挤眉弄眼地说：“这个姑娘像葡萄干一样香甜，别有风味。这样的，本地再也找不出第二个。我担保她是个浪——漫——女——郎。她在基辅上学，读六年级。现在是到父亲这儿来消夏的。她父亲是本地的林务官。她跟我妹妹莉莎很熟。我给她写过一封情书，你知道，满篇都是动人的词句。我说我发狂地爱着她。战栗地期待着她的回信。我甚至选了纳德森［纳德森（1862—1887），俄国诗人。——译者］的一首诗，抄了进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then two young men, both seventh-grade Gymnasium students, were coming across the bridge at the pump house. One of them was the seventeen-year-old son of engineer Sukharko, the chief of the railway yards, a loutish, fair-haired, freckle-faced scapegrace whom his schoolmates had clubbed Pockmarked Shurka. He was carrying a fancy fishing rod and line and had a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth. With him was Victor Leszczinski, a tall, effeminate youth.</div>

But that's how it always is in the beginning. I'm an old hand at this sort of thing. As a matter of fact I can't be bothered with all that romantic nonsense -- mooning about for ages, sighing. It's much simpler to take a stroll of an evening down to the repairmen's barracks where for three rubles you can pick up a beauty that'd make your mouth water. And no nonsense either. I used to go out there with Valka Tikhonov -- do you know him? The foreman on the railway."</div>

<div class="line_en">Pavel had grown up in poverty and want, and he was hostile to anyone whom he considered to be well off. And so his feeling for Tonya was tinged with apprehension and misgiving; Tonya was not one of his own crowd, she was not simple and easy to understand like Galochka, the stonemason's daughter, for instance. With Tonya he was always on his guard, ready to rebuff any hint of the mockery or condescension he would expect a beautiful and cultivated girl like her to show towards a common stoker like himself.</div>
