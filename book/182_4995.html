<div class="line_en">Susan and the two boys were bitterly tired with rowing before they rounded the last headland and began the final pull up Glasswater itself, and Lucy's head ached from the long hours of sun and the glare on the water. Even Trumpkin longed for the voyage to be over. The seat on which he sat to steer had been made for men, not Dwarfs, and his feet did not reach the floor-boards; and everyone knows how uncomfortable that is even for ten minutes. And as they all grew more tired, their spirits fell. Up till now the children had only been thinking of how to get to Caspian. Now they wondered what they would do when they found him, and how a handful of Dwarfs and woodland creatures could defeat an army of grown-up Humans.</div>

<div class="line_en">Twilight was coming on as they rowed slowly up the windings of Glasswater Creek -- a twilight which deepened as the banks drew closer together and the overhanging trees began almost to meet overhead. It was very quiet in here as the sound of the sea died away behind them; they could even hear the trickle of the little streams that poured down from the forest into Glasswater.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们慢慢划过清水湾的时候，夜幕已经降临——随着海岸一点点靠近，暮色也越来越浓，河岸上伸出来的树枝不时碰到头上。大海的声音在他们身后渐渐消失了，这里非常安静，甚至能听见潺潺的小溪从森林里流向清水湾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Through a gap in the bracken and branches she could just see a patch of water in the Creek and the sky above it. Then, with a thrill of memory, she saw again, after all those years, the bright Narnian stars. She had once known them better than the stars of our own world, because as a Queen in Narnia she had gone to bed much later than as a child in England. And there they were -- at least, three of the summer constellations could be seen from where she lay: the Ship, the Hammer, and the Leopard. "Dear old Leopard," she murmured happily to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过树枝的空隙，她刚好看见河里的一道清水。翻过身来，她又看见了一片星空，不由得激起她对往事的回想。她曾经是多么熟悉纳尼亚的星星，因为作为纳尼亚的女王，晚上何时睡觉，从来不受别人管束。这时，从她躺着的地方，至少可以看到三个夏日星座：轮船星座、铁锤星座和豹子星座。“亲爱的老豹子！”她轻声呼唤着，好像与老朋友久别重逢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went ashore at last, far too tired to attempt lighting a fire; and even a supper of apples (though most of them felt that they never wanted to see an apple again) seemed better than trying to catch or shoot anything. After a little silent munching they all huddled down together in the moss and dead leaves between four large beech trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们终于登陆了。谁也没有力气去拾柴点火，更谈不上去捕猎充饥，他们宁愿再吃一顿苹果，尽管苹果已经吃得太多，丝毫不能引起他们的食欲。他们默默地嚼了一阵苹果，便缩作一团，躺倒在四棵高大栎树下面那层厚厚的枯叶上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone except Lucy went to sleep at once. Lucy, being far less tired, found it hard to get comfortable. Also, she had forgotten till now that all Dwarfs snore. She knew that one of the best ways of getting to sleep is to stop trying, so she opened her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了露茜以外，其他人倒下便睡着了。露茜没有那么累，所以翻来覆去，怎么躺都觉得不舒服。更糟糕的是，杜鲁普金鼾声大作，简直像在打雷。她知道，在这种情况下，最好的办法就是不要勉强去睡。于是，她睁开双眼，漫无目标地朝前望去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy's eyes began to grow accustomed to the light, and she saw the trees that were nearest her more distinctly. A great longing for the old days when the trees could talk in Narnia came over her. She knew exactly how each of these trees would talk if only she could wake them, and what sort of human form it would put on. She looked at a silver birch: it would have a soft, showery voice and would look like a slender girl, with hair blown all about her face, and fond of dancing. She looked at the oak: he would be a wizened, but hearty old man with a frizzled beard and warts on his face and hands, and hair growing out of the warts. She looked at the beech under which she was standing. Ah! she would be the best of all. She would be a gracious goddess, smooth and stately, the lady of the wood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜的眼睛渐渐适应了这里的光线，她便仔细打量起身边的一草一木来，因为她心里充满了对过去那些岁月的怀念。那时，纳尼亚的树木不仅会讲话，简直是能说会道。她深信这些树木都有灵性，而且能化作人形。看那棵银桦，它应该有清脆圆润的嗓子，长得像一位苗条的姑娘，肩上披散着棕色的长发，舞姿极其优美。再看那棵老栎树，它该是一位慈祥并充满智慧的老人，须发苍苍，由于上了年纪，手上的青筋都鼓起来了。还有身边这棵山毛榉，美丽、端庄、高贵、安详。啊，你这森林的女神！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is lovely," said Lucy to herself. It was cool and fresh, delicious smells were floating everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这太可爱了，”露西自言自语地说。清凉新鲜，到处飘着美味的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead of getting drowsier she was getting more awake -- with an odd, night-time, dreamish kind of wakefulness. The Creek was growing brighter. She knew now that then moon was on it, though she couldn't see the moon. And now she began to feel that the whole forest was coming awake like herself. Hardly knowing why she did it, she got up quickly and walked a little distance away from their bivouac.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么一来，她不仅全无睡意，反而更精神了——那是一种奇怪的、只有夜间才有的梦幻般的清醒。海湾亮如白昼，她知道月亮已经升起了，尽管看不见它。忽然，她感到整个森林都像她自己一样苏醒了过来。出于一种莫名的冲动，她迅速站起身，悄悄离开了宿营地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somewhere close by she heard the twitter of a nightingale beginning to sing, then stopping, then beginning again. It was a little lighter ahead. She went towards the light and came to a place where there were fewer trees, and whole patches or pools of moonlight, but the moonlight and the shadows so mixed that you could hardly be sure where anything was or what it was. At the same moment the nightingale, satisfied at last with his tuning up, burst into full song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜晚的空气凉爽、清新，带着幽微的花香。不远处有一只夜莺在歌唱，它时唱时停，悠然自得。前面的光线比较明亮，露茜信步走过去，来到一个树木稀疏的地方。恬静的月光与树木的阴影交织在一起，使人辨不清周围的景物。这时，那夜莺终于定准了调子，开始引吭高歌起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Trees, Trees, Trees," said Lucy (though she had not been intending to speak at all). "Oh, Trees, wake, wake, wake. Don't you remember it? Don't you remember me? Dryads and Hamadryads, come out, come to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，树神，我的老朋友们！”露茜不由自主地轻声呼唤起来，“你们醒醒，醒醒啊！你们真的睡熟了吗？你们把我忘记了吗？林中仙女，水族仙女，出来吧，到我这儿来吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lucy felt that at any moment she would begin to understand what the trees were trying to say. But the moment did not come. The rustling died away. The nightingale resumed its song. Even in the moonlight the wood looked more ordinary again. Yet Lucy had the feeling (as you sometimes have when you are trying to remember a name or a date and almost get it, but it vanishes before you really do) that she had just missed something: as if she had spoken to the trees a split second too soon or a split second too late, or used all the right words except one, or put in one word that was just wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜觉得她随时都可能听懂树木在说什么，结果她失望了。沙沙声渐渐消失，夜莺又重新开始了它的歌唱，这使露茜感到茫然若有所失。是自己来得不合时宜，还是做错了什么事，或者说错了什么话？她百思不得其解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quite suddenly she began to feel tired. She went back to the bivouac, snuggled down between Susan and Peter, and was asleep in a few minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first things seemed to be going pretty well. They even -- thought they had struck an old path; but if you know anything about woods, you will know that one is always finding imaginary paths. They disappear after about five minutes and then you think you have found another (and hope it is not another but more of the same one) and it also disappears, and after you have been well lured out of your right direction you realize that none of them were pats at all. The boys and the Dwarf, however, were used to woods and were not taken in for more than a few seconds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开始，似乎一切都还顺利，他们相信走的是正确的路线。可是，假如你对森林有些起码的常识，那你就会知道走在森林里的人们常常会被想像出来的道路所迷惑。因为，过不了几分钟，脚下的路便消失了。于是，你的眼睛马上转向另一条路，希望这是刚才那条路的延续。走不多远，这条路又不见了。你最后将发现，原来脚下根本就不是路。好在两个男孩子和那小矮人都在森林里走惯了，所以也没有绕多少弯路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had plodded on for about half an hour (three of them very stiff from yesterday's rowing) when Trumpkin suddenly whispered, "Stop." They all stopped. "There's something following us," he said in a low voice. "Or rather, something keeping up with us: over there on the left." They all stood still, listening and staring till their ears and eyes ached. "You and I'd better each have an arrow on the string," said Susan to Trumpkin. The Dwarf nodded, and when both bows were ready for action the party went on again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们吃力而缓慢地向前走了大约有半个钟头（他们中间有三个由于昨天划船，直到现在还浑身酸痛），突然，杜鲁普金悄声说“停！”大家立刻紧张地停下脚步。“有什么东西在跟踪我们，”小矮人把声音压得很低，“或者说它在与我们平行前进——就在左边那儿。”孩子们紧张地站在原地，眼睛盯着小矮人手指的地方，半天也不见有什么动静。“我们俩最好在弓上搭一支箭。”苏珊对杜鲁普金说。小矮人点点头，表示赞成。当两张弓都箭在弦上后，大家才多了些安全感，又继续向前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went a few dozen yards through fairly open woodland, keeping a sharp look-out. Then they came to a place where the undergrowth thickened and they had to pass nearer to it. Just as they were passing the place, there came a sudden something that snarled and flashed, rising out from the breaking twigs like a thunderbolt. Lucy was knocked down and winded, hearing the twang of a bowstring as she fell. When she was able to take notice of things again, she saw a great grim-looking grey bear lying dead with Trumpkin's arrow in its side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们十分警觉地在一片较为开阔的林子里又走了几十米，然后来到一个灌木茂密的地方。猛然间，随着一声呼啸，一只什么野兽从灌木后面猛扑过来。露茜猝不及防，一下被扑倒在地上，打了几个滚儿。她在跌倒的一刹那，听见嗒的一声弓弦响。当她清醒过来时，看到一只面目狰狞的大灰熊，躺在地上，已经气绝身亡。熊的大脑袋上还插着杜鲁普金的一支箭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I certainly thought we'd have struck it by now," said Peter. "But there's nothing to do but keep on." They both knew that the Dwarf was looking anxiously at them, but he said nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had come, without seeing it, almost to the edge of a small precipice from which they looked down into a gorge with a river at the bottom. On the far side the cliffs rose much higher. None of the party except Edmund (and perhaps Trumpkin) was a rock climber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知不觉中他们来到一个悬崖的边缘，从这儿居高临下，可以看到一条峡谷，以及谷底的河流。对面的峭壁要离得多。除了爱德蒙以外（也许还有杜鲁普金），谁也不曾在岩石上攀登过。">查看中文翻译</div>

Miraz will have finished with Caspian before we get there at that rate."</div>

A landslide might have pulled off half the side of that hill, leaving bare rock, and there are your precipices beyond the gorge. Then the Rush might go on deepening its course year after year till you get the little precipices this side. Or there might have been an earthquake, or anything."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，是不是应该说：‘过去不在峡谷里？’”小矮人仍不死心，“你所熟悉的是几百年甚至几千年以前的纳尼亚。这么多年过去了，难道它就不会改变？一次大塌方，就完全可能把那座山削去一面，留下光秃秃的岩石，成为峡谷那边的峭壁。以后，年复一年，端急的河流不断地冲击河槽，结果在这一面又形成了我们脚下的悬崖。我们还可以设想，这里曾经发生过地震之类的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And anyway," continued Trumpkin, "even if this is not the Rush, it's flowing roughly north and so it must fall into the Great River anyway. I think I passed something that might have been it, on my way down. So if we go downstream, to our right, we'll hit the Great River. Perhaps not so high as we'd hoped, but at least we'll be no worse off than if you'd come my way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无论如何，”杜鲁普金接着说，“即便这不是河口，可它涓涓流向北方，势将汇入那条大河口。来的路上我似乎曾经走过这个地方。因此，假如我们朝下游走，再往右拐……”">查看中文翻译</div>
