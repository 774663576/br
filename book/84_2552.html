<div class="line_en">On Sunday, a week later, a man at church asked me to dinner. I said no. It happened a second time a few days later with a different man. Again I said no. I couldn't say yes. I didn't want either of them anywhere near me.</div>

He said I should enroll in the university counseling service so that one day I might enjoy an eternal marriage to a righteous man.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, when I was fifteen, after I'd started wearing mascara and lip gloss, Shawn had told Dad that he'd heard rumors about me in town, that I had a reputation. Immediately Dad thought I was pregnant. He should never have allowed those plays in town, he screamed at Mother. Mother said I was trustworthy, modest. Shawn said no teenage girl was trustworthy, and that in his experience those who seemed pious were sometimes the worst of all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十五岁时，我开始涂睫毛膏和唇彩后，肖恩告诉爸爸，说他在城里听到了关于我的传言，说我名声不好。爸爸立刻以为我怀孕了。他对着母亲咆哮，说他不该放任我去城里演戏看戏。母亲说应该相信我，我是个正派女孩。肖恩说，青春期的女孩没有一个值得信赖，根据他的经验，有时那些看似虔诚的女孩最为糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had always scoffed at the word "whore." It sounded guttural and outmoded even to me. But even though I silently mocked Shawn for using it, I had come to identify with it. That it was old-fashioned only strengthened the association, because it meant I usually only heard the word in connection with myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我总是嘲笑“妓女”这个词。这个听上去像喉音的词，对我来说过时了。尽管肖恩使用这个词时我会暗自嘲笑，但我还是慢慢将自己与它画上了等号。这个词的古老更加强了其联想意味，我通常只在与自己有关的场合才听到它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My body felt heavy as I walked to my apartment. All my life I had been taught that marriage was God's will, that to refuse it was a kind of sin. I was in defiance of God. And yet, I didn't want to be. I wanted children, my own family, but even as I longed for it I knew I would never have it. I was not capable. I could not be near any man without despising myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Days later, when it was confirmed that I was not pregnant, I evolved a new understanding of the word "whore," one that was less about actions and more about essence.

<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，当证实自己并没有怀孕，我便对“妓女”这个词有了新的理解。这个词更关乎实质，而非行为。与其说我做错了什么，不如说我以错误的方式存在。我的存在中有一些不洁的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the summer ended, I returned to BYU with only two thousand dollars. On my first night back, I wrote in my journal: I have so many bills I can't imagine how I'm going to pay them. But God will provide either trials for growth or the means to succeed. The tone of that entry seems lofty, high-minded, but in it I detect a whiff of fatalism. Maybe I would have to leave school. That was fine. There were grocery stores in Utah. I would bag groceries, and one day I'd be manager.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暑假结束后，我带着仅有的两千美元回到杨百翰大学。回来的第一天晚上，我在日记中写道：账单太多了，真的无法想象我该如何支付。但是上帝会为我提供成长的考验或成功的途径。这则日记的口吻似乎是崇高的、高尚的，但我在其中体会到一点点宿命论的味道。也许我将不得不离开学校。也好。犹他州有很多杂货店。我可以给杂物打包，总有一天会成为经理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My first day in Idaho, I got my old job back at Stokes. Dad scoffed, said I'd never earn enough to return to school. He was right, but the bishop had said God would provide a way and I believed it. I spent the summer restocking shelves and walking elderly ladies to their cars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在爱达荷州的第一天，我就到斯托克斯商店做起了以前的工作。爸爸嘲笑我，说我挣的钱永远不够交学费。他说得没错，但是主教说过上帝自有办法，而我对此深信不疑。整个夏天，我都在整理货架，将年迈的女顾客送回她们的车上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I avoided Shawn. It was easy because he had a new girlfriend, Emily, and there was talk of a wedding. Shawn was twenty-eight; Emily was a senior in high school. Her temperament was compliant. Shawn played the same games with her he'd played with Sadie, testing his control. She never failed to follow his orders, quivering when he raised his voice, apologizing when he screamed at her. That their marriage would be manipulative and violent, I had no doubt -- although those words were not mine. They had been given to me by the bishop, and I was still trying to wrest meaning from them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我躲着肖恩。这并不难，因为他交了一个新女友埃米莉，据说两人要结婚了。肖恩二十八岁了；埃米莉是一名高三学生，性情温顺。肖恩和她玩了之前同赛迪玩过的那套把戏，来测试自己的控制能力。她从未抗拒他的命令，他一提高嗓门，她就浑身发抖；他一朝她大喊，她就马上道歉。他们的婚姻会充满操纵和暴力，对此我毫无疑问——尽管这些话不是我说的，是主教说的，而我还在努力思索其中的含义。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd never taken another ibuprofen since that day with Charles, but I began to swallow them like breath mints. They helped only a little. The pain was in the nerves, and it was too severe. I hadn't slept since the ache began, and I started skipping meals because chewing was unthinkable. That's when Robin told the bishop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在查尔斯那次之后，我再也没有服用过布洛芬，但现在我开始像吃薄荷糖一样吞下它们。可它们只起了一点作用。疼痛来自神经，而且疼得太厉害了。自从开始疼痛，我就没有睡过觉；因为咀嚼太疼，我也开始不吃东西。这个时候，罗宾把此事告诉了主教。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was shocked out of this resignation two weeks into the fall semester, when I awoke one night to a blinding pain in my jaw. I'd never felt anything so acute, so electrifying. I wanted to rip my jaw from my mouth, just to be rid of it. I stumbled to a mirror. The source was a tooth that had been chipped many years before, but now it had fractured again, and deeply. I visited a dentist, who said the tooth had been rotting for years. It would cost fourteen hundred dollars to repair. I couldn't afford to pay half that and stay in school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="秋季学期才过了两周，我就从这种听天由命的状态中惊醒过来。一天晚上，我被下巴的剧痛疼醒。我从未体验过如此剧烈的疼痛，如过电一般。只要能摆脱疼痛，我宁愿把下巴从嘴上撕下来。我跌跌撞撞地来到一面镜子前。疼痛源自一颗多年前碎裂的牙齿，现在它再次断裂，而且断面很深。我去看了牙医，牙医说这颗牙已经腐烂多年，修补好要花一千四百美元。哪怕我只支付一半，剩下的钱也不够我继续学业。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In December, after my last paycheck of the month, I had sixty dollars in my account. Rent was $110, due January 7. I needed quick cash. I'd heard there was a clinic near the mall that paid people for plasma. A clinic sounded like a part of the Medical Establishment, but I reasoned that as long as they were taking things out, not putting anything in, I'd be okay. The nurse stabbed at my veins for twenty minutes, then said they were too small.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was an incurious student that semester. Curiosity is a luxury reserved for the financially secure: my mind was absorbed with more immediate concerns, such as the exact balance of my bank account, who I owed how much, and whether there was anything in my room I could sell for ten or twenty dollars. I submitted my homework and studied for my exams, but I did so out of terror -- of losing my scholarship should my GPA fall a single decimal -- not from real interest in my classes.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was it, then. There was nothing left to sell, no more childhood friends or Christmas presents. It was time to quit school and get a job. I accepted that. My brother Tony was living in Las Vegas, working as a long-haul trucker, so on Christmas Day I called him. He said I could live with him for a few months and work at the In-N-Out Burger across the street.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn's bedroom was filthy. Dirty clothes littered the floor, and I could see the butt of a handgun poking out from under a pile of stained T-shirts. The bookshelves strained under boxes of ammo and stacks of Louis L'Amour paperbacks. Shawn was sitting on the bed, his shoulders hunched, his legs bowed outward. He looked as if he'd been holding that posture for some time, contemplating the squalor. He let out a sigh, then stood and walked toward me, lifting his right arm. I took an involuntary step back, but he had only reached into his pocket. He pulled out his wallet, opened it and extracted a crisp hundred-dollar bill.</div>
