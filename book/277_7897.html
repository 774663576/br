<div class="line_en">And, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon him almost by chance as, bare-limbed and pipe in hand, he was following the flock of the poor goatherd who had brought him up, and whose son he had always fancied himself to be. The child of the old King's only daughter by a secret marriage with one much beneath her in station -- a stranger, some said, who, by the wonderful magic of his lute-playing, had made the young Princess love him; while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom the Princess had shown much, perhaps too much honour, and who had suddenly disappeared from the city, leaving his work in the Cathedral unfinished -- he had been, when but a week old, stolen away from his mother's side, as she slept, and given into the charge of a common peasant and his wife, who were without children of their own, and lived in a remote part of the forest, more than a day's ride from the town. Grief, or the plague, as the court physician stated, or, as some suggested, a swift Italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine, slew, within an hour of her wakening, the white girl who had given him birth, and as the trusty messenger who bare the child across his saddle-bow, stooped from his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of the goatherd's hut, the body of the Princess was being lowered into an open grave that had been dug in a deserted churchyard, beyond the city gates, a grave where, it was said, that another body was also lying, that of a young man of marvellous and foreign beauty, whose hands were tied behind him with a knotted cord, and whose breast was stabbed with many red wounds.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the night before the day fixed for his coronation, and the young King was sitting alone in his beautiful chamber. His courtiers had all taken their leave of him, bowing their heads to the ground, according to the ceremonious usage of the day, and had retired to the Great Hall of the Palace, to receive a few last lessons from the Professor of Etiquette; there being some of them who had still quite natural manners, which in a courtier is, I need hardly say, a very grave offence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other. Certain it was that the old King, when on his death-bed, whether moved by remorse for his great sin, or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass away from his line, had had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the Council, had acknowledged him as his heir.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少，这正是人们私下悄悄相互传递的说法。然而令人确信的是老国王在临终时，不知是由于对自己犯下的大罪而悔恨，或是仅仅因为希望自己的王国不至于落入外人之手，就派人去找回那个少年，并当着宫中大臣的面，承认少年为自己的继位人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had shown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have so great an influence over his life. Those who accompanied him to the suite of rooms set apart for his service, often spoke of the cry of pleasure that broke from his lips when he saw the delicate raiment and rich jewels that had been prepared for him, and of the almost fierce joy with which he flung aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin cloak. He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life, and was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace -- Joyeuse, as they called it -- of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world fresh-fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the council-board or audience-chamber, he would run down the great staircase, with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration from sickness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="似乎就从少年被承认的那一刻起，他就表现出了对美丽事物的极大热情，这便注定了将对他的一生起到巨大的影响。那些陪伴他到预备的房间侍候他休息的仆人，常常讲起当他看见那些华丽的服装和贵重宝石时会兴奋地大叫起来，并且在脱去身上的粗皮衣和粗羊皮外套时简直是欣喜若狂。有时候他确也很怀念他那段自由自在的森林生活，且始终都对占去一天大部分时间的繁杂的宫廷礼节感到忿懑，但这却是座富丽的宫殿——人们把它叫做“逍遥宫”——此刻他一下子成了它的主人，对他来说，这就像是一个专为取悦他而新建成的时髦的新世界；只要他能够从议会厅或会见室里逃出来，他便会跑下那立着镀金铜狮的亮闪闪的斑岩石大台阶，从一个屋子转到另一个屋子，又从一条走廊来到另一条走廊，好像要一个人在美中间找到一付止痛药，或一种治病的良方似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Upon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them -- and, indeed, they were to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he would sometimes be accompanied by the slim, fair-haired Court pages, with their floating mantles, and gay fluttering ribands; but more often he would be alone, feeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination, that the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the lonely worshipper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于这种充满新发现的旅行，这是他对此的称谓——说真的，对他来说这可是真正地在神境中漫游了。有时候会有几位身着披风飘着艳丽丝带的金发宫廷侍卫陪伴着；但更多的时候，他常常是一个人，凭着感觉上的某种敏捷的本能，这差不多是一种先见之明吧，把握到艺术的秘密最好是在秘密中求得，况且美也同智慧一样，钟爱的是孤独的崇拜者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many curious stories were related about him at this period. It was said that a stout Burgomaster, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical address on behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him kneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been brought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new gods. On another occasion he had been missed for several hours, and after a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one of the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a Greek gem carved with the figure of Adonis. He had been seen, so the tale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue that had been discovered in the bed of the river on the occasion of the building of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name of the Bithynian slave of Hadrian. He had passed a whole night in noting the effect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion.</div>

<div class="line_en">All rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him, and in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants, some to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas, some to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found only in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties, some to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to India to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade, sandalwood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切稀罕的和昂贵的东西对他的确都有极大的吸引力，使他急切地想得到它们。为此他派出了许多商人，有的被派往北海，向那里的穷渔夫购买琥珀，有的到埃及去找寻那些只有在法老的墓穴中才能找到的绿宝石，据说这种宝石具有非同一般的魔力，还有的去波斯收购丝绒编织的地毯和彩陶，另外很多人就去印度采购薄纱和着色的象牙，月亮宝石和翡翠手镯，檀香和蓝色珐琅以及细毛织披巾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his coronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls. Indeed, it was of this that he was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching the great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth. The designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the time, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given orders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out, and that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be worthy of their work. He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar of the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and lingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark woodland eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，最让他费心的还是在他登位加冕时穿的长袍。长袍是金线织的，另外还有嵌满了红宝石的王冠以及那根挂着一串串珍珠的权杖。其实，他今晚所想的就是这个，当时他躺在奢华的沙发上，望着大块的松木在壁炉中慢慢地燃尽。它们都是由那个时代最著名的艺术家亲手设计的，设计式样也早在几个月前就呈交给他过目了，他也下了命令要求工匠们不分昼夜地把它们赶制出来，还让人去满世界找寻那些能够配得上他们手艺的珠宝。他在想象中看见自己穿着华贵的皇袍站在大教堂中高高的祭坛上，他那孩子气的嘴唇上露出了笑容，那双森林人特有的黑眼睛也放射出明亮的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a bubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river. Far away, in an orchard, a nightingale was singing. A faint perfume of jasmine came through the open window. He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and taking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords. His heavy eyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him. Never before had he felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery of beautiful things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="窗外，他可以看见教堂的大圆顶，隐隐约约的像个气泡浮动在阴暗的房屋上面。无精打采的哨兵们在靠近河边的雾蒙蒙的阳台上来回地走着。在远处的一座果园里，一只夜莺在唱歌。一缕浅浅的茉莉花香从开着的窗户飘了进来。他把自己的棕色卷发从前额朝后掠去，随后拿起一只琵琶，让手指随便地在弦上拨弄着。他的眼皮沉重地往下垂去，一股莫名的倦意袭上身来。在这以前他从来没有这么强烈地并且是如此兴奋地感受到美的东西的魔力和神秘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room. The walls were hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty. A large press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx. Pale poppies were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like white foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling. A laughing Narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head. On the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿他站起身来，靠在壁炉顶部雕花的庇檐上，目光环视着灯光昏暗的屋子。四周的墙上挂着代表“美的胜利”的华丽装饰物。一个大衣橱，上面嵌着玛瑙和琉璃，把一个墙角给填满了。面对窗户立着一个异常别致的柜子，上面的漆格层不是镀了金粉就是镶着金片，格层上摆放着一些精美的威尼斯玻璃高脚酒杯，还有一个黑纹玛瑙大杯子。绸子的床单上绣着一些浅白的罂粟花，它们好像是从睡眠的倦手中撒落下来的。刻有条形凹槽的高大的象牙柱撑起天鹅绒的华盖，华盖上面大簇的驼鸟毛像白色泡沫一般地向上伸展，一直达到银白色的回文装饰屋顶上。用青铜做的美少年纳西苏斯像满脸笑容地用双手举起一面亮光光的镜子。桌上放着一个紫晶做的平底盆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream. He thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the whirr and clatter of many looms. The meagre daylight peered in through the grated windows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over their cases. Pale, sickly-looking children were crouched on the huge cross-beams. As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed the threads together. Their faces were pinched with famine, and their thin hands shook and trembled. Some haggard women were seated at a table sewing. A horrible odour filled the place. The air was foul and heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他睡着后做了一个梦，梦是这样的：他觉得自己正站在一间又长又矮的阁楼里，四周是一片织布机的转动声和敲击声。微弱的光线透过格栅窗射了进来，使他看见了那些俯在织机台上工作的织工们憔悴的身影。一些面带病容脸色苍白的孩子们蹲在巨大的横梁上而。每当梭子飞快地穿过经线的时候，织工们便把沉重的箱座抬起，梭子一停下来又立即放下筘座，把线压在一起。他们的脸上露出饥饿难忍的表情，一双双干枯的手不停地震动着，颤抖着。一些赢弱的妇女坐在一张桌边做着缝纫。房间里充满了刺鼻的臭气，空气既污浊又沉闷，四壁因潮湿而滴水不止。">查看中文翻译</div>

We must work to live, and they give us such mean wages that we die.

The merchants grind us down, and we must needs do their bidding. The priest rides by and tells his beads, and no man has care of us. Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her. Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at night. But what are these things to thee? Thou art not one of us. Thy face is too happy."

<div class="line_en">And when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd's dress, he rose up in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, "My son, is this a king's apparel? And with what crown shall I crown thee, and what sceptre shall I place in thy hand? Surely this should be to thee a day of joy, and not a day of abasement."</div>

<div class="line_en">And when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, "My son, I am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil things are done in the wide world. The fierce robbers come down from the mountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors. The lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels. The wild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines upon the hill. The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of the fishermen, and take their nets from them. In the salt-marshes live the lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh them. The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the dogs. Canst thou make these things not to be? Wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board? Shall the lion do thy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee? Is not He who made misery wiser than thou art? Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast done, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and put on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I will crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand. And as for thy dreams, think no more of them. The burden of this world is too great for one man to bear, and the world's sorrow too heavy for one heart to suffer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教听完了三个梦后，眉头紧锁，他说：“孩子，我是个老人，已进入垂暮之年，我知道在这个大千世界里还有很多邪恶的东西。凶狠的土匪从山上下来，掳去无数小孩，把他们卖给摩尔人。狮子躺在草丛中等待着过往的商队，准备扑咬骆驼。野猪将山谷中的庄稼连根拔起。狐狸咬着山上的葡萄藤。海盗们在海岸一带兴风作浪，焚烧渔船，还把渔民的渔网抢走。在盐泽地带住着麻疯病人，他们用芦苇杆盖起小屋，没有人愿意接近他们。乞丐们在大街上漂流，同狗一起争食吃。你能够让这些事情不出现吗？你愿意让麻疯病人同你一起睡觉，让乞丐同你一起进餐吗？你会叫狮子听你的话，野猪服从你的命令吗？难道制造出这些苦难的上帝还不如你聪明吗？因此，我不会为你所做的事而赞扬你的，我要求你骑马回你自己的王宫中，脸上要露出笑容，并穿上符合国王身分的衣服，我要用金王冠来为你加冕，我要把嵌满珍珠的权杖放在你的手中。至于你的那些梦，就不要再想它们了。这世上的负担已经太重了，是一个人难以承受的；人间的愁苦也太大了，不是一颗心所能负担的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
