<div class="line_en">She stood in the doorway in flannel pajamas, a toddler on her hip and two small girls clinging to her leg. Her son, about six, stood behind her. Audrey stepped aside to let me pass, but her movements were stiff, and she avoided looking directly at me. We'd spent little time together since she'd married.</div>

<div class="line_en">I moved into the house, stopping abruptly in the entryway when I saw a three-foot hole in the linoleum that plunged to the basement. I walked past the hole and into the kitchen, which was filled with the scent of our mother's oils -- birch, eucalyptus, ravensara.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day before I returned to England, I drove seven miles along the mountain range, then turned onto a narrow dirt road and stopped in front of a powder-blue house. I parked behind an RV that was nearly as large as the house itself. I knocked; my sister answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在返回英国的前一天，我开车沿山脉行驶七英里，然后拐到一条狭窄的土路上，来到一座浅灰蓝色的房子跟前。我在一辆几乎和房子一样大的房车后面停了车，敲了敲门。我姐姐来开门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The conversation was slow, halting. Audrey asked me no questions about England or Cambridge. She had no frame of reference for my life, so we talked about hers -- how the public school system was corrupt so she was teaching her children herself, at home. Like me, Audrey had never attended a public school. When she was seventeen, she had made a fleeting effort to get her GED. She had even enlisted the help of our cousin Missy, who had come up from Salt Lake City to tutor her. Missy had worked with Audrey for an entire summer, at the end of which she'd declared that Audrey's education hovered somewhere between the fourth- and fifth-grade levels, and that a GED was out of the question. I chewed my lip and stared at her daughter, who had brought me a drawing, wondering what education she could hope to receive from a mother who had none herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的谈话慢条斯理，时断时续。奥黛丽没有问我关于英国和剑桥大学的问题。她对我的生活一无所知，于是我们谈论她的生活——公立学校如何腐败透顶，所以她自己在家教孩子。和我一样，奥黛丽从未上过公立学校。她十七岁时曾有一段时间努力想拿到普通同等学力证书，甚至还将盐湖城的表妹米茜请来教她。米茜帮奥黛丽辅导了一整个暑假，最后宣布，奥黛丽的教育停留在四五年级水平，想取得普通同等学力证书根本不可能。她的女儿拿来一张画给我看，我咬着嘴唇，盯着这个女孩，心想她能指望从一个没有受过教育的母亲那里学到什么呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know why I said it; I suppose Shawn was on my mind. I regretted the words even as they left my lips, hated myself for saying them. I turned to pass the tea set to my sister, so she could administer justice however she saw fit, but when I saw her expression I nearly dropped it. Her mouth hung open in a perfect circle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道为什么这么说，我脑子里想的是肖恩。话一出口，我就后悔了，恨自己说了这样的话。我转身将茶具递给姐姐，好让她为孩子们主持公正，但看到她的表情时，我差点儿把茶具扔在地上。她的嘴张成了一个圆圈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had brought a small porcelain tea set for her children, and when they began to quarrel over the teapot, I gathered up the pieces. The oldest girl reminded me that she was five now, which she said was too old to have a toy taken away. "If you act like a child," I said, "I'll treat you like one."</div>

<div class="line_en">We made breakfast for the children, then played with them in the snow. We baked, we watched crime dramas and designed beaded bracelets. It was as if I had stepped through a mirror and was living a day in the life I might have had, if I'd stayed on the mountain. But I hadn't stayed. My life had diverged from my sister's, and it felt as though there was no common ground between us. The hours passed; it was late afternoon; and still she felt distant from me, still she refused to meet my gaze.</div>

<div class="line_en">That moment would stay with me. I would remember it the next day, when I boarded a plane in Salt Lake City, and it would still be on my mind when I landed in London. It was the shock of it that I couldn't shake. Somehow, it had never occurred to me that my sister might have lived my life before I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻将永远伴随着我。第二天在盐湖城登机时，我会忆起它；飞机在伦敦着陆时，我心里仍会想着它。那一刻带来的震撼，我无法摆脱。不知何故，我竟从未意识到，我所经历的一切，姐姐可能在我之前就经历过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In April I began to do well. I wrote an essay on John Stuart Mill's concept of self-sovereignty, and my supervisor, Dr. David Runciman, said that if my dissertation was of the same quality, I might be accepted to Cambridge for a PhD. I was stunned: I, who had sneaked into this grand place as an impostor, might now enter through the front door. I set to work on my dissertation, again choosing Mill as the topic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四月，我开始步入正轨。我写了一篇关于约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒自我主权概念的文章。我的导师大卫·朗西曼博士说，如果我的论文保持同一水准，我就有可能获得在剑桥读博士的资格。我惊呆了：我像一个冒名顶替者，偷偷溜进这座宏伟的殿堂，现在终于可以光明正大地从前门进来了。我开始撰写论文，再次选择穆勒作为主题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That term, I presented myself to the university like resin to a sculptor. I believed I could be remade, my mind recast. I forced myself to befriend other students, clumsily introducing myself again and again until I had a small circle of friends. Then I set out to obliterate the barriers that separated me from them. I tasted red wine for the first time, and my new friends laughed at my pinched face. I discarded my high-necked blouses and began to wear more fashionable cuts -- fitted, often sleeveless, with less restrictive necklines. In photos from this period I'm struck by the symmetry: I look like everyone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个学期，我把自己交给大学，就像把树脂交给雕塑家。我相信自己可以被重塑，思想彻底改变。我强迫自己和其他同学交往，一次又一次向别人笨拙地介绍自己，直到我有了一个小小的朋友圈子。接着我着手清除挡在我和他们之间的障碍。我第一次品尝了红酒，我的新朋友们嘲笑我喝酒时紧绷的脸。我扔掉高领衫，开始穿剪裁更时尚的衣服——修身、通常是无袖的、领口不那么规矩的衣服。在这段时期的照片中，我为这种平衡感到震惊：我和其他人看起来并无两样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We handed in our final essays for the term, then boarded a plane. On our first evening in Rome, we climbed one of the seven hills and looked out over the metropolis. Byzantine domes hovered over the city like rising balloons. It was nearly dusk; the streets were bathed in amber. It wasn't the color of a modern city, of steel, glass and concrete. It was the color of sunset. It didn't look real. Nic asked me what I thought of his home, and that was all I could say: it didn't look real.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们提交了最后几篇期末论文，便登上了飞机。在罗马的第一晚，我们爬上了七座山丘中的一座，俯瞰着这座大都市。拜占庭式的圆顶像腾空的气球一样盘旋在城市上空。那时天色已近黄昏，街道沐浴在琥珀色的光辉中。那不是钢、玻璃和混凝土构成的现代城市的颜色，而是夕阳的颜色，看上去如此不真实。尼克问我对他的家乡有何看法，而我只能说：它看上去很不真实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One afternoon near the end of term, when I was eating lunch in the library cafeteria, I recognized a group of students from my program. They were seated together at a small table. I asked if I could join them, and a tall Italian named Nic nodded.

<div class="line_en">Nic took us to the conservatory where he'd studied violin. It was in the heart of Rome and was richly furnished, with a grand staircase and resonant halls. I tried to imagine what it would have been like to study in such a place, to walk across marble floors each morning and, day after day, come to associate learning with beauty. But my imagination failed me. I could only imagine the school as I was experiencing it now, as a kind of museum, a relic from someone else's life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尼克带我们去了他过去学习小提琴的音乐学院。它坐落在罗马的中心地带，装饰富丽堂皇，有宏伟的楼梯和敞亮的大厅。我试着想象在这样一个地方学习会是怎样的感觉：每天清晨踏过大理石地板，日复一日，将学习与美相联系。但我想象不出来。我只能将我置身的这所学校想象成一座博物馆，目之所见皆是别人生活的遗迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For two days we explored Rome, a city that is both a living organism and a fossil. Bleached structures from antiquity lay like dried bones, embedded in pulsating cables and thrumming traffic, the arteries of modern life. We visited the Pantheon, the Roman Forum, the Sistine Chapel. My instinct was to worship, to venerate. That was how I felt toward the whole city: that it should be behind glass, adored from a distance, never touched, never altered. My companions moved through the city differently, aware of its significance but not subdued by it. They were not hushed by the Trevi Fountain; they were not silenced by the Colosseum. Instead, as we moved from one relic to the next, they debated philosophy -- Hobbes and Descartes, Aquinas and Machiavelli. There was a kind of symbiosis in their relationship to these grand places: they gave life to the ancient architecture by making it the backdrop of their discourse, by refusing to worship at its altar as if it were a dead thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在罗马游览了两天。这座城市既生机勃勃，又犹如化石。褪色的古老建筑仿佛风干的骨头，嵌在现代生活的动脉——搏动的电缆和繁忙的交通中。我们参观了万神殿、古罗马广场和西斯廷教堂。我本能地产生了膜拜敬仰之情。这就是我对整座城市的感受：它应该被放置在玻璃后面，让世人从远处瞻仰，不可触摸，亘古不变。我的同伴们不一样，他们在这座城市中穿梭，意识到它的重要性，但并未被它征服。他们没有在许愿池边安静下来，也没有在罗马斗兽场保持沉默。相反，在我们参观一个个历史遗迹的路上，他们讨论起哲学——霍布斯和笛卡尔，阿奎那和马基雅维利。他们与这些宏伟的建筑之间存在一种共生关系：他们将古老的建筑作为他们谈话的背景，给予它们生命；他们拒绝将它们视为死物，在它们的祭坛前顶礼膜拜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the rest of the week, I experienced Rome as they did: as a place of history, but also as a place of life, of food and traffic and conflict and thunder. The city was no longer a museum; it was as vivid to me as Buck's Peak. The Piazza del Popolo. The Baths of Caracalla. Castel Sant'Angelo. These became as real to my mind as the Princess, the red railway car, the Shear. The world they represented, of philosophy, science, literature -- an entire civilization -- took on a life that was distinct from the life I had known. At the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, I stood before Caravaggio's Judith Beheading Holofernes and did not once think about chickens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的一周里，我像他们一样体验了罗马：一个历史圣地，也是一个充满生活气息、美食、交通、冲突和雷声的地方。这座城市不再是一座博物馆，对我而言它像巴克峰一样鲜活。罗马人民广场。卡拉卡拉浴场。圣天使堡。在我脑海中，这些就像印第安公主、红色火车车厢和大剪刀一样真实。它们所代表的世界——包含哲学、科学和文学的整个文明——与我熟知的生活截然不同。在国立古代艺术美术馆，我站在卡拉瓦乔《朱迪斯砍下霍洛芬斯的头颅》面前，丝毫没有联想到杀鸡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the third night there was a rainstorm. I stood on Nic's balcony and watched streaks of lightning race across the sky, claps of thunder chasing them. It was like being on Buck's Peak, to feel such power in the earth and sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三晚来了一场暴风雨。我站在尼克家的阳台上，看着闪电划破长空，听着隆隆雷声。那一刻我恍若回到了巴克峰，感受到天地间如此巨大的威力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning was cloudless. We took a picnic of wine and pastries to the grounds of the Villa Borghese. The sun was hot, the pastries ambrosial. I could not remember ever feeling more present. Someone said something about Hobbes, and without thinking I recited a line from Mill. It seemed the natural thing, to bring this voice from the past into a moment so saturated with the past already, even if the voice was mixed with my own. There was a pause while everyone checked to see who had spoken, then someone asked which text the line was from, and the conversation moved forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天一早，万里无云。我们在博尔盖塞别墅的庭院里野餐，喝红酒，吃点心。阳光灿烂，糕点美味。当时那种感觉超越一切。有人提到霍布斯，我不假思索地背出穆勒的一句名言。将这个声音从过去带到一个浸淫了历史的时刻，似乎再自然不过，即使这个声音与我自己的声音交织在一起。大家停顿了一下，看看是谁说的，然后有人问起这句话的出处，于是谈话继续。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had never heard Mother admit that Dad might be mentally ill. Years before, I had told her what I'd learned in my psychology class about bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, but she had shrugged it off. Hearing her say it now felt liberating. The illness gave me something to attack besides my father, so when Mother asked why I hadn't come to her sooner, why I hadn't asked for help, I answered honestly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从未听母亲亲口承认过爸爸可能患有精神疾病。几年前，我告诉她我在心理学课上学到的关于躁郁症和精神分裂症的知识，但她对此不屑一顾。听到她现在这么说，我感到无比轻松。这种疾病也给了我一些反击父亲的勇气，所以当母亲问我为什么不早点儿找她，为什么不寻求帮助时，我如实作答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="读到这些文字，我脑海中又浮现出年轻时的母亲，她头脑聪颖、活力四射，但同时又忧心忡忡、顺从听话。接着她的形象变了，她的身体变得又瘦又长，一头长长的银发随风飘动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I asked about a memory. It was from the weeks before I'd left for BYU, after Shawn had had a particularly bad night. He'd brought Mother to tears, then plopped onto the sofa and turned on the TV. I'd found her sobbing at the kitchen table, and she'd asked me not to go to BYU. "You're the only one strong enough to handle him," she'd said. "I can't, and your father can't. It has to be you."</div>

<div class="line_en">I lived a lifetime in the moment I read those lines, a life that was not the one I had actually lived. I became a different person, who remembered a different childhood. I didn't understand the magic of those words then, and I don't understand it now. I know only this: that when my mother told me she had not been the mother to me that she wished she'd been, she became that mother for the first time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读到这句话的那一刻，我似乎度过了漫长的一生，但那并非我真实的生活。我变成了另一个人，记忆中有不一样的童年。当时我不明白这些文字的魔力，现在也不明白。我只知道一点：当母亲告诉我，说她没有像自己所希望的那样做一个好母亲时，她才第一次成了我的母亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

She had built that business, with all those people working for her, and it dwarfed my father's business, and all the other businesses in the whole town; she, that docile woman, had a power in her the rest of us couldn't contemplate. And Dad. He had changed. He was softer, more prone to laugh. The future could be different from the past.

<div class="line_en">I told them I'd been poor, I told them I'd been ignorant, and in telling them this I felt not the slightest prick of shame. Only then did I understand where the shame had come from: it wasn't that I hadn't studied in a marble conservatory, or that my father wasn't a diplomat. It wasn't that Dad was half out of his mind, or that Mother followed him. It had come from having a father who shoved me toward the chomping blades of the Shear, instead of pulling me away from them. It had come from those moments on the floor, from knowing that Mother was in the next room, closing her eyes and ears to me, and choosing, for that moment, not to be my mother at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我告诉他们，我曾经贫穷而无知。当我告诉他们这些时，我丝毫不感到羞耻。那时我才明白羞耻感的来源：不是因为我不曾在铺着大理石的音乐学院学习，也不是因为我没有当外交官的父亲；不是因为父亲是半个疯子，也不是因为母亲跟着他亦步亦趋。我的羞耻感源自我有一个将我朝吱嘎作响的大剪刀刀刃推去，而不是将我拉走远离它们的父亲；我的羞耻感源自我躺在地上的那些时刻，源自知道母亲就在隔壁房间闭目塞听，那一刻完全没有选择去尽一个母亲的责任。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My life in Cambridge was transformed -- or rather, I was transformed into someone who believed she belonged in Cambridge. The shame I'd long felt about my family leaked out of me almost overnight. For the first time in my life I talked openly about where I'd come from. I admitted to my friends that I'd never been to school. I described Buck's Peak, with its many junkyards, barns, corrals. I even told them about the root cellar full of supplies in the wheat field, and the gasoline buried near the old barn.</div>

<div class="line_en">I fashioned a new history for myself. I became a popular dinner guest, with my stories of hunting and horses, of scrapping and fighting mountain fires. Of my brilliant mother, midwife and entrepreneur; of my eccentric father, junkman and zealot. I thought I was finally being honest about the life I'd had before. It wasn't the truth exactly, but it was true in a larger sense: true to what would be, in the future, now that everything had changed for the better. Now that Mother had found her strength.</div>
