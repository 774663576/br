I'm keeping an eye open myself so's to know what portrait to hang up. Wouldn't care to get into trouble like Gerasim Leontievich next door. You see, he didn't look out properly and had just gone and hung up a picture of Lenin when three men rushed in -- Petlyura men as it turned out. They took one look at the picture and jumped on him -- a good twenty strokes they gave him. 'We'll skin you alive, you Communist sonofabitch,' they shouted.
