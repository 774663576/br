<div class="line_en">The war of 1947 between the Corleone Family and the Five Families combined against them proved to be expensive for both sides. It was complicated by the police pressure put on everybody to solve the murder of Captain McCluskey. It was rare that operating officials of the Police Department ignored political muscle that protected gambling and vice operations, but in this case the politicians were as helpless as the general staff of a rampaging, looting army whose field officers refuse to follow orders.</div>

<div class="line_en">This lack of protection did not hurt the Corleone Family as much as it did their opponents. The Corleone group depended on gambling for most of its income, and was hit especially hard in its "numbers" or "policy" branch of operations. The runners who picked up the action were swept into police nets and usually given a medium shellacking before being booked. Even some of the "banks" were located and raided, with heavy financial loss. The "bankers,".90 calibers in their own right, complained to the caporegimes, who brought their complaints to the family council table. But there was nothing to be done. The bankers were told to go out of business. Local Negro free-lancers were allowed to take over the operation in Harlem, the richest territory, and they operated in such scattered fashion that the police found it hard to pin them down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种无保护状态，对考利昂家族的伤害并不大。考利昂帮的大部分收入是主办赌博，而在这个帮控制之下的彩票赌博，遭受的打击特别惨重。经营这类活动的接待员、收款员给警察一网打尽了，照例受到中等程度的打击，然后再记入档案。甚至有些庄家的秘密地点也被查了出来，也都遭到袭击。钱财损失惨重，那些庄家在他们自己的权限内都是叱咤风云的人物，都纷纷向司令诉苦；司令把他们的怨言带到家族会议桌上。但是，仍然无能为力。赌博庄家得到的答复是要他们转业。当地男人中有单干的猛士得到许可，可以接管哈莱姆地区的摆赌活动。哈莱姆是这一行中最能赚钱的地区，他们摆赌场不是集中在一处，而是分散在各处，到处流动，因此警察想要抓他们也困难。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen understood that the policeman believes in law and order in a curiously innocent way. He believes in it more than does the public he serves. Law and order is, after all, the magic from which he derives his power, individual power which he cherishes as nearly all men cherish individual power. And yet there is always the smoldering resentment against the public he serves. They are at the same time his ward and his prey. As wards they are ungrateful, abusive and demanding. As prey they are slippery and dangerous, full of guile. As soon as one is in the policeman's clutches the mechanism of the society the policeman defends marshals all its resources to cheat him of his prize. The fix is put in by politicians. Judges give lenient suspended sentences to the worst hoodlums. Governors of the States and the President of the United States himself give full pardons, assuming that respected lawyers have not already won his acquittal. After a time the cop learns. Why should he not collect the fees these hoodlums are paying? He needs it more. His children, why should they not go to college? Why shouldn't his wife shop in more expensive places? Why shouldn't be himself get the sun with a winter vacation in Florida? After all, he risks his life and that is no joke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根知道：警察相信法律和秩序达到了可笑的天真的程度。他们对法律和秩序的信任胜过民众对法律和秩序的信任。法律和秩序归根到底是警察汲取权力的魔泉，汲取个人权力的魔泉。他们对个人权力的珍惜，同所有的人对个人权力的珍惜是一样的。可是，他们对民众，始终有一种郁积的愤感。民众是他们保护的对象，同时又是他们掠夺的对象。作为接受保护的对象，民众就显得忘恩负义，不安分守己，还没完没了地提出各种要求；作为被掠夺对象，民众却又显得滑溜溜的，而且很危险，诡计多端。一旦有人被警察抓住，警察所保护的社会机构就会发挥其全部威力，企图把他们捕获的人骗出来。这里，幕后操纵的是政客。对罪大恶极的强盗，法官总是宽大地给以缓期执行的判决。各州州长，甚至美国总统本人，因为认定受尊敬的律师们没有为罪犯争取到无罪释放的宣判，所以经常发布大赦令。这样过了一段时间警察也就学乖了，为什么他就不应该接受流氓递过来的钱？他更需要钱呀。还有他的孩子，为什么他的孩子就不应该上大学？为什么他老婆就不应该到物品贵重的商店去买东西？为什么在寒假时他本人就不应该到佛罗里达去晒晒太阳？总而言之，当警察就是玩命的，这种说法并非开玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the death of Captain McCluskey, some newspapers printed stories involving him with Sollozzo. They published proof that McCluskey had received large sums of money in cash, shortly before his death. These stories had been planted by Hagen, the information supplied by him. The Police Department refused to confirm or deny these stories, but they were taking effect. The police force got the word through informers, through police on the Family payroll, that McCluskey had been a rogue cop. Not that he had taken money or clean graft, there was no rank-and-file onus to that. But that he had taken the dirtiest of dirty money; murder and drugs money. And in the morality of policemen, this was unforgivable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从警官麦克罗斯基死后，有些报纸就登载他同索洛佐牵涉在一起的故事。报纸公布证据，证明他在死前曾收到了几大笔现款。这些故事全是黑根编造的，情况也是他提供的。对这些故事，警察局既不承认也不否认，但是很见效。警察当局从密告者们那里，从接受考利昂家族定期津贴的警察那里得到情报，说麦克罗斯基本来就是个流氓警察。问题不是他接受了钱或正当的贿赂，而是他接受了最脏的赃款，接受了坑害人命的钱和贩卖毒品的钱。就警察道德来说，这是不可宽恕的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But usually he draws the line against accepting dirty graft. He will take money to let a bookmaker operate. He will take money from a man who hates getting parking tickets or speeding tickets. He will allow call girls and prostitutes to ply their trade; for a consideration. These are vices natural to a man. But usually he will not take a payoff for drugs, armed robberies, rape, murder and other assorted perversions. In his mind these attack the very core of his personal authority and cannot be countenanced.</div>

<div class="line_en">The murder of a police captain was comparable to regicide. But when it became known that McCluskey had been killed while in the company of a notorious narcotics peddler, when it became known that he was suspected of conspiracy to murder, the police desire for vengeance began to fade. Also, after all, there were still mortgage payments to be made, cars to be paid off, children to be launched into the world. Without their "sheet" money, policemen had to scramble to make ends meet. Unlicensed peddlers were good for lunch money. Parking ticket payoffs came to nickels and dimes. Some of the more desperate even began shaking down suspects (homosexuals, assaults and batteries) in the precinct squad rooms. Finally the brass relented. They raised the prices and let the Families operate. Once again the payoff sheet was typed up by the precinct bagman, listing every man assigned to the local station and what his cut was each month. Some semblance of social order was restored.</div>

These were, of course, supplemented by the much more formidable soldiers of Tessio's regime. But Sonny was not satisfied even with this. By the middle of February, when the Don could be moved without danger, he was taken by ambulance to his home in the mall. The house had been renovated so that his bedroom was now a hospital room with all equipment necessary for any emergency. Nurses specially recruited and checked had been hired for round-the-clock care, and Dr. Kennedy, with the payment of a huge fee, had been persuaded to become the physician in residence to this private hospital.

Clemenza staffed one apartment and Tessio the other. All Family bookmakers were given bodyguard teams. The policy bankers in Harlem, however, had gone over to the enemy and at the moment nothing could be done about that. All this cost the Corleone Family a great deal of money and very little was coming in. As the next few months went by, other things became obvious. The most important was that the Corleone Family had overmatched itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在市内确定了两幢公寓大楼作为兵营，里面铺满了床垫，还有个保存食品的冷藏室。此外，枪支弹药也都准备好了。克莱门扎的兵占一幢楼，忒希奥的兵占另一幢楼。所有的考利昂家族和赌注登记庄家，都配备了保镖队。不过，哈莱姆地区的彩票赌博庄家，也都纷纷倒向敌人，这在当前情况下是一点办法也没有的。这一切，都使考利昂家族丢掉了很多很多的钱，而进来的钱却很少很少。又过了几个月，别的方面的失算也看得清楚了，其中最重要的是考利昂家族陷于强敌包围之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonny Corleone recognized these weaknesses in the Family's wartime posture but could not take any steps to remedy them. He was not the Don and only the Don could replace the caporegimes and the Consigliere. And the very act of replacement would make the situation more dangerous, might precipitate some treachery. At first, Sonny had thought of fighting a holding action until the Don could become well enough to take charge, but with the defection of the policy bankers, the terrorization of the bookmakers, the Family position was becoming precarious. He decided to strike back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿·考利昂意识到了本家族战时领导阵容的弱点，但也拿不出任何补救办法，原因是他还没有当上老头子。只有当上了老头子，才有资格撤换司令和参谋。如果撤换就会使局势更加复杂化，也很可能发生叛变。起初，桑儿只想固守阵地，等到老头子恢复健康、可以挑起战争重任的时候再另作打算。但是，彩票赌博庄家背叛了，赌注登记庄家受到了暴力威胁，考利昂家族的地位越来越虚弱。他决定马上反击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he decided to strike right at the heart of the enemy. He planned the execution of the heads of the five Families in one grand tactical maneuver. To that purpose he put into effect an elaborate system of surveillance of these leaders. But after a week the enemy chiefs promptly, dived underground and were seen no more in public.</div>
