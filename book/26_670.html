<div class="line_en">I only sat there on my tomb and read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its meaning; by the time I had grasped the whole of which I had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只是坐在坟墓上，仔细琢磨着迈尔斯刚才跟我所说的话的全部意思。等弄明白了以后，我也接受了。而对于缺席礼拜，成为我的学生和其他人迟到的先例，我则感到非常惭愧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That his uncle should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution that, strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that I simply procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth. The boy, to my deep discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say to me: "Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this interruption of my studies, or you cease to expect me to lead with you a life that's so unnatural for a boy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他叔叔应该来和我一起处理这些事情，这是个解决方法，严格意义上来讲，我现在应该渴望他来，但是我无法面对这件不光彩的事及其带来的痛苦，所以我只是拖拖拉拉，得过且过。迈尔斯成了有理的一方，这让我感到心神不宁，他仿佛理直气壮地对我说：“你要么跟我的监护人澄清打扰我学习的神秘事情，要么就别期望我和你一起生活，这样的生活对一个男孩来说太别扭了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对自己说，最重要的是迈尔斯已经从我这里知道了一些事情，对他而言，证据就是这次难堪的崩溃。他已经从我这里得知，有些事情令我非常恐惧，而为了达到自己的目的，他很可能会利用我的这种恐惧，去获取更多的自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My fear was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for that was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的恐惧是：我不得不应付他被学校开除这一令人无法容忍的问题，因为正是在这个问题的背后积累起来了恐怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed him. It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow no power to restore me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，从我没有跟着他进去的那一刻起，这事就结束了。我可怜地屈服于内心的烦乱，我意识到了这一点，却无力挽回。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked round the church, hesitating, hovering; I reflected that I had already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我绕着教堂走啊走，犹豫着，徘徊着。我意识到，由于他，我已经对自己造成了无法恢复的伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was so unnatural for the particular boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我所关心的这个男孩突然说出了他的想法和计划，这太反常了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therefore I could patch up nothing, and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for an hour in close, silent contact with his commentary on our talk. For the first minute since his arrival I wanted to get away from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，我不能弥补任何事，我要使出最大的努力，才能和他一起挤在长条凳上：他会比以前更有把握地用胳膊挽着我，让我亲密地和他在那里坐一个小时，默默地通过他对我们的谈话的评论来交流。从他到来的第一刻起，我就想远离他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I paused beneath the high east window and listened to the sounds of worship, I was taken with an impulse that might master me, I felt, completely should I give it the least encouragement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在东面高高的窗子下停了下来，听人们祈祷的声音，一种冲动好像控制了我，我觉得我完全不应该给这想法哪怕是一丝一毫的鼓励。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I might easily put an end to my predicament by getting away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I could give the whole thing up -- turn my back and retreat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要离开，我就能很轻易地摆脱这种困境。机会就摆在我面前，没人会阻止我，我可以放弃一切——转过身去，全身而退。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was only a question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive desperately off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只是一个需要抓紧时间回去稍做准备的问题，很多仆人都去了教堂，房子实际上是空荡荡的。总之，如果我不顾一切地离开，没有人会责怪我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner? That would be in a couple of hours, at the end of which -- I had the acute prevision -- my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my nonappearance in their train.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我离开，直到晚餐时才回去，那会怎么样呢？大概会有几个小时，到那时——我能敏锐地预感到——我的小学生们会天真地为我没有出现在他们的队伍里而感到纳闷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the world, to worry us so -- and take our thoughts off, too, don't you know? Did you desert us at the very door?" I couldn't meet such questions nor, as they asked them, their false little lovely eyes; yet it was all so exactly what I should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last let myself go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你做什么去了，你这个淘气包，坏事情吗？你到底为什么让我们这么担心——弄得我们心神不宁，你难道不知道吗？你是不是在门口就丢下我们了？”我无法面对他们问起的这些问题，也无法面对他们虚伪却小巧可爱的眼睛，然而这一切正是我不得不面对的，即使我预计到后果会更加尖刻，我最终还是离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my mind I would fly. The Sunday stillness both of the approaches and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense of opportunity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就当我到达住处的时候，我好像就已下定决心要飞离而去。礼拜天，门口和屋里都静悄悄的，我没遇到一个人，这让我很激动，难得有这样的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came straight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the park.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立马离开了教堂，径直走出教堂庭院。我思虑重重，穿过公园按原路走了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have to be remarkable, however, and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果想按这个方式尽快离开，我应该默不作声地离去。我非常快速地做着决定，然而，交通工具是需要解决的一个大问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但当我打开门再次去找时，眼前忽然一闪，我的双眼豁然开朗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking down at the foot of the staircase -- suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then, with a revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more than a month before, in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had seen the specter of the most horrible of women. At this I was able to straighten myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to take.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大厅里，我被重重困难和障碍折磨着，我记得在楼梯角处，我的身体一沉——突然瘫倒在最底层的台阶上。然后，带着一种反感，我回忆起了正是在这里，在一个多月前的黑夜里，我弯了下腰，就看到了那个恐怖至极的女幽灵。想到这里，我直起身子，继续朝楼上走去。慌乱中，我走向了教室，那里有我的一些东西，我得带上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the presence of what I saw I reeled straight back upon my resistance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到眼前的场景，我的抵抗情绪让我向后打了个趔趄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看见，在正午的明媚阳光下，有个人坐在我的桌旁。如果不是我以前有过的经历，乍一看，我会以为是某个女仆留在家里打理，可能没人注意，她忙里偷闲，教室的桌子以及我的钢笔、墨水和纸被她用来给自己的心上人认真地写封情书。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她无耻而又悲惨地站在我的面前，但正当我定睛细看，在记忆中确认的时候，那个可怕的身影消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dark as midnight in her black dress, her haggard beauty and her unutterable woe, she had looked at me long enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as mine to sit at hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的黑色连衣裙如午夜一般漆黑，她憔悴的美、无法用言语表达的悲哀、她长久的注视，仿佛在说她有权坐在我桌旁，就像我有权坐在她的桌旁一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her attitude strangely persisted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的胳膊放在桌子上休息，她的两只手疲惫地支撑着头。但是当我想到这里时，我注意到尽管我已进来了，她却纹丝不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一时刻延续着，我感到一阵异常的寒意，感觉我才是闯入者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then it was -- with the very act of its announcing itself -- that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there as my vile predecessor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，她改变了姿势，从而表明了她的身份一个姿势的改变使她的身份突然明朗起来。她站起身，好像并不是因为听到我进来了，而是带着一种难以名状的冷漠、淡然的忧郁，站在离我十几英尺的地方——可怕的前任家庭教师！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was as a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her -- "You terrible, miserable woman!" I heard myself break into a sound that, by the open door, rang through the long passage and the empty house. She looked at me as if she heard me, but I had recovered myself and cleared the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发疯了般的抗议，实际上向她喊道：“你这个可怕的、可怜的女人！”我听到自己突然发出的声音通过开着的门，响彻整个长长的走廊和空空的房子。她看向我，仿佛听到了我，但我已经缓过神来，让自己冷静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一分钟，房间里已经空空如也，只留下了阳光和一种感觉，那就是我必须留下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
