<div class="line_en">On Tuesday, the fifth day of work, Therese sat in a little bare room with no ceiling at the back of the Black Cat Theatre, waiting for Mr. Donohue, the new director, to come and look at her cardboard model. Yesterday morning, Donohue had replaced Cortes as director, had thrown out her first model, and also thrown out Phil McElroy as the second brother in the play. Phil had walked out yesterday in a huff. It was lucky she hadn't been thrown out along with her model, Therese thought, so she had followed Mr. Donohue's instructions to the letter. The new model hadn't the movable section she had put into the first, which would have permitted the living- room scene to be converted into the terrace scene for the last act. Mr. Donohue seemed to be adamant against anything unusual or even simple. By setting the whole play in the living room, a lot of the dialogue had to be changed in the last act, and some of the cleverest lines had been lost. Her new model indicated a fireplace, broad French windows giving onto a terrace, two doors, a sofa, and a couple of armchairs and a bookcase. It would look, when finished, like a room in a model house at Sloan's, lifelike down to the last ash tray.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese stood up, stretched herself, and reached for the corduroy jacket that was hanging on a nail in the door. The place was cold as a barn. Mr. Donohue probably wouldn't come in until afternoon, or not even today if she didn't remind him again. There was no hurry about the scenery. It might have been the least important matter in the whole production, but she had sat up until late last night, enthusiastically working on the model.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝站起来伸了一下懒腰，把挂在门钉子上的灯芯绒外套拿在手上。这里冷得像个谷仓一样，导演唐纳修说不定要到下午才出现，要不是她一直提醒他，他今天甚至可能不会出现呢。场景的事并不急迫，在整出戏的制作过程中可能是最不重要的事，但她昨晚还是熬到深夜，满腔热忱地制作场景模型。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went out to stand in the wings again. The cast was all on stage with scripts in hand. Mr. Donohue kept running the cast through the whole play, to get the flow of it, he said, but today it seemed to be only putting them to sleep. All the cast looked lazy except Tom Harding, a tall blond young man who had the male lead, and he was a little too energetic. Georgia Halloran was suffering from sinus headaches, and had to stop every hour to put drops in her nose and lie down for a few minutes. Geoffrey Andrews, a middle-aged man who played the heroine's father, grumbled constantly between his lines because he didn't like Donohue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又出去站到台侧，看着全体演员站在舞台上，手里拿着剧本。唐纳修不断叫演员从头排演整出戏，他的说法是这样才能找出整出戏的节奏，但今天这么做只是让他们昏昏欲睡。除了汤姆·哈丁外，所有的演员看起来都很慵懒。哈丁是个高大的金发年轻人，担任男主角，而且有点精力过剩。乔治娅·哈洛伦患了鼻窦性头痛，每个小时都必须停下来把药水滴到鼻子里，然后躺着不动几分钟。中年男人杰弗里·安德鲁斯担任女主角父亲一角，他讨厌唐纳修，所以不断在台词与台词间咕哝着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese watched him waving his arms to indicate the speakers, putting up a hand to silence them, following the script with his head down as if he led an orchestra. Tom Harding winked at her, and pulled his hand down his nose. After a moment, Therese went back to the room behind the partition, where she worked, where she felt a little less useless. She knew the play almost by heart now. It had a rather Sheridanesque comedy of errors plot -- two brothers who pretend to be valet and master in order to impress an heiress with whom one of the brothers is in love. The dialogue was gay and altogether not bad, but the dreary, matter-of-fact set that Donohue had ordered for it -- Therese hoped something could be done with the color they would use.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝看着他挥舞双臂指示谁该说话，或举起手要说话的人停止，低头看着剧本，仿佛在指挥交响乐团一样。汤姆·哈丁对她眨眨眼，把手拉到鼻子下做鬼脸。过了一会儿，特芮丝回到后面演员休息室的小间，这里是她工作的地方，在这里她也比较不会觉得自己毫无用处。她几乎已经把整出戏都背出来了，情节有谢里丹[1]错误喜剧的味道，一对兄弟假装是主仆，希望感动一个千金小姐爱上弟弟。这出戏对话机智，整体而言还不坏，但唐纳修要求的场景太过平板，到最后了无生趣，特芮丝希望他选用的背景颜色能够略加更改。【注：[1] 理查德·布林斯莱·谢里丹（Richard Brinsley Sheridan，1751—1816），十八世纪知名喜剧剧作家。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no, no, no," said Mr. Donohue for the tenth time that morning, stopping everything and causing everybody to lower his script and turn to him with a puzzled, irritated docility. "Let's start again from page twenty-eight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不对，不对，不对，不对！”唐纳修那天早上第十次喊道，叫停所有动作，每个人都放下剧本，每个人都很困惑、生气，却又屈服于他的权威。“从第二十八页再来一次。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Donohue did come in just after twelve o'clock. He looked at her model, lifted it up and looked at it from below and from both sides, without any change in his nervous, harassed expression. "Yes, this is fine. I like this very much. You see how much better this is than those empty walls you had before, don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十二点过后没多久，唐纳修进来了，看着她做的场景，然后拿起来看看底部和两侧，脸上紧张、烦恼的表情还在。“对，还不错，我很喜欢。你看，这样比你之前那个空荡荡的墙面要漂亮多了，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她点头，同时看着场景，想知道这个新的设计到底是哪里比以前的好，大概更有功能性吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese stared at the cardboard model. At least she would see it used. At least she and the carpenters would make it something real. She went to the window and looked out at the gray but luminous winter sky, at the backs of some five-story houses garlanded with fire escapes. In the foreground was a small vacant lot with a runted leafless tree in it, all twisted up like a signpost gone wild. She wished she could call Carol and invite her for lunch. But Carol was an hour and a half away by car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝盯着纸板模型瞧，至少这个场景可以派上用场。至少她和木匠会一起将场景模型化为实际的舞台景象。她走到窗边，往外看着灰色又带着光亮的冬季天空，看着一栋五层楼房后方的防火门。前面有一块小空地，上面有一株小枯树，枯干的树枝交缠，好像混乱的路标柱一样。她真希望现在可以打电话给卡罗尔，邀她一起午餐。但从卡罗尔家开车到这里，要一个半小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese whistled a song as she walked there, happy as if she were meeting Carol. The restaurant had sawdust on the floor, and a couple of black kittens played around under the rail of the bar. Abby was sitting at a table in the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝一面朝餐厅走，一面哼着歌，高兴得仿佛就要和卡罗尔碰面一样。餐厅地板上有锯木屑，还有几只黑色的小猫在吧台扶手下面玩耍。艾比坐在后面的一张桌子旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝摇摇头。“不，谢谢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And perhaps she was in love with Carol, too. It put Therese on guard with her. It created a tacit rivalry that gave her a curious exhilaration, a sense of certain superiority over Abby -- emotions that Therese had never known before, never dared to dream of, emotions consequently revolutionary in themselves. So their lunching together in the restaurant became nearly as important as the meeting with Carol.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许艾比也爱着卡罗尔，想到这又让特芮丝对她起了戒心，产生了莫名的敌意，这种莫名的敌意带给特芮丝一种奇特的愉悦，某种胜过艾比的优越感。这种感觉，是特芮丝以往从不知道、从不敢想像的情绪，这些情绪具有极大的意义。所以，她和艾比在餐厅共进午餐这回事，变得几乎和亲眼见到卡罗尔一样重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You mean, you're so happy without it?" Abby asked, and she chuckled with that secret amusement that in Abby was somehow not offensive.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Abby's manner, the glow in her face as if today, or every day, were a special holiday for her. Therese liked that. She looked admiringly at Abby's suit of red and blue weave, her cuff links that were scrolly G's, like filigree buttons in silver. Abby asked her about her job at the Black Cat. It was tedious to Therese, but Abby seemed impressed. Abby was impressed, Therese thought, because she did nothing herself.</div>

The radio in the corner played a tango -- a little cheesebox of a radio with a broken front, but the music might have come from a string orchestra behind them, at Abby's request. No wonder Carol likes her, Therese thought. She complemented Carol's solemnity, she could remind Carol to laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主菜上桌了，两名服务生在桌边忙着拔开塞子，替她们斟满酒，又端上新鲜奶油。角落有个像是乳酪盒子、面板有点坏掉的收音机正播放着探戈舞曲，但乐声响起来又像是后面有个弦乐团正应艾比的要求而演奏。特芮丝想，难怪卡罗尔喜欢她，她弥补了卡罗尔的严肃，她可以提醒卡罗尔要经常大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

The apartment was a semi-basement, generally darkish, and the lamp made a warm pool of light on the desk that was always cluttered. Therese looked down at the opened books on his desk, the pages and pages covered with symbols that she could not understand, but that she liked to look at. Everything the symbols stood for was true and proven. The symbols were stronger and more definite than words. She felt Dannie's mind swung on them, from one fact to another, as if he bore himself on strong chains, hand over hand through space. She watched him assembling a sandwich, standing at the kitchen table. His shoulders looked very broad and rounded with muscle under his white shirt, shifting a little with the motions of laying the salami and cheese slices onto the big piece of rye bread.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh," he said sadly. "Then it's out. And I'd had some hope. I'd had a little feeling of destiny.

<div class="line_en">She smiled."Even the poets?" She thought of Carol, and then of Abby, of their conversation at lunch that had been so much more than a glance and so much less, and the sequence of emotions it had evoked in her. It depressed her. "But you have to make allowances for people's perversities, things that don't make much sense."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她笑了。“就算是诗人？”她想到卡罗尔，然后想到艾比，想到午餐时的对话，也想到那段对话在她心里激起的一系列情绪，让她很沮丧。“你也必须体谅别人的怪癖，体谅那些没有太大意义的怪癖。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dannie looked at her for a moment, then pushed himself off from the wall. He turned to the stove, and got a match from his shirt pocket, and Therese sensed that the conversation dangled, would always dangle and never be finished, whatever they went on to say. But she felt if she told Dannie every word that she and Abby had exchanged, that he could clear away its subterfuges with a phrase, as if he sprinkled a chemical in the air that would dry up the mist instantly. Or was there always something that logic couldn't touch? Something illogical, behind the jealousy, the suspicion and the hostility in Abby's conversation, that was Abby all by herself?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼看了她一会儿，本来靠在墙面上的身子撑起来，走向火炉，又从衬衫口袋里拿出一根火柴。特芮丝明白，接下来无论两人要谈什么，他们的对话注定要悬在那里，永远悬在那里，没有个结局。她认为，如果把她和艾比的谈话内容一五一十地告诉丹尼，他只要用一句话就可以把一切事情都厘清，仿佛在空中洒了某种神奇的化学药品，立刻把迷雾驱散一般。还有哪些事情是逻辑无法解释的？有些事本身就不带有任何逻辑。艾比对话里面的嫉妒、猜忌与敌意，全部是出自艾比自己吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes -- but there are some people or some things people do that you can't salvage anything from finally, because nothing connects with you." It was of something else she wanted to talk about, though, not this at all. Not Abby or Carol, but before. Something that made perfect connection and perfect sense. She loved Carol. She leaned her forehead against her hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，但是有些人或事，是你无力挽回的，因为那些事情都跟你无关。”她现在想谈的其实不是这些事情了。现在她不想谈艾比或卡罗尔，想谈的是更早之前的事。那些更早之前的事，好像可以产生完全的关联和完全的意义。她爱卡罗尔。她把额头靠在手上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I feel as if it were growing, like a plant, not disappearing. I feel everything in the world must have the texture of a plant sometimes to a poet. Even this table, like my own flesh." He touched the table edge with his palm; "It's like a feeling I had once riding up a hill on a horse. It was in Pennsylvania. I didn't know how to ride very well then, and I remember the horse turning his head and seeing the hill, and deciding by himself to run up it, his hind legs sank before we took off, and suddenly we were going like blazes and I felt completely in harmony with the horse and the land, as if we were a whole tree simply being stirred by the wind in its branches. I remember being sure that nothing would happen to me then, but some other time, yes, eventually. And it made me very happy. I thought of all the people who are afraid and hoard things, and themselves, and I thought, when everybody in the world comes to realize what I felt going up the hill, then there'll be a kind of right economy of living and of using and using up. Do you know what I mean?" Dannie had clenched his fist, but his eyes were bright as if he still laughed at himself. "Did you ever wear out a sweater you particularly liked, and throw it away finally?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得火柴好像在成长一样，就像植物一样，不会消失。我觉得对诗人而言，世界上每样东西都必然会有植物的结构。甚至是这张桌子，或我自己的血肉，都是如此。”他用手掌碰触桌缘。“就好像以前我骑马爬上山的感觉。以前在宾州，我还不太会骑马，我记得那匹马转头看着山丘，然后决定自己跑上去。马的后腿先往下沉，然后才起跑。突然间我们就风驰电掣地跑了出去，可是我一点也不害怕，反而觉得自己和这匹马，还有脚底下的大地融为一体，仿佛我们是棵树，和风轻轻吹抚树枝。我还记得当时心里很笃定，知道自己在那个当下不会发生意外，也知道以后免不了会出事。想到这里我就很开心。我又想起，有人因为恐惧而把自己、把事物隐藏起来，接着我又想到，如果全世界的人都和我一样，了解到我现在骑马爬山这种天人合一的感觉，那我们自然会产生一种和谐、适当的生活态度，还有消费、使用的观念。你了解我的意思吗？”丹尼握紧拳头，但他的眼睛散发着光亮，仿佛仍在自嘲着。“你有没有这样的经验，最喜欢的毛衣穿坏了，然后把它丢掉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Some things don't react. But everything's alive." He turned around with a broad smile, as if quite another train of thought had entered his head. He was holding up the match that was still smoking. "Like this match. And I'm not talking physics, about the indestructibility of smoke. In fact, I feel rather poetic today."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有些事情，彼此之间不会互相起反应的，但每件事都有自己的生命力。”他转头咧嘴笑了，脑中似乎出现了一串截然不同的想法，手里的火柴还在冒烟。“就像这根火柴，我并不想用物理学上的物质不灭概念去认定‘烟’是无法摧毁的。其实我今天觉得自己充满了诗意。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes." She knew. And like Richard and the kite, because he could make another kite. She thought of Abby with a sense of vacuity suddenly, as if the luncheon had been eradicated.

<div class="line_en">Dannie came toward her, put his hands on her shoulders, and though she felt it was only a gesture, a gesture instead of a word, the spell was broken. She was uneasy at his touch, and the uneasiness was a point of concreteness. "I should go back," she said. "I'm way late."</div>
