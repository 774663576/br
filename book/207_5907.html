<div class="line_en">I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A beggar-woman and her little boy -- pale, ragged objects both -- were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse -- some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.</div>

<div class="line_en">While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling to look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在梳头时朝镜子里打量了一下自己的脸，感到它不再平庸了。面容透出了希望，脸色有了活力，眼睛仿佛看到了果实的源泉，从光彩夺目的涟漪中借来了光芒。我向来不愿去看我主人，因为我怕我的目光会使他不愉快。但是现在我肯定可以扬起脸来看他的脸了，我的表情不会使他的爱心冷却。我从抽屉里拿了件朴实干净的薄夏装，穿在身上。似乎从来没有一件衣服像这件那么合身，因为没有一件是在这种狂喜的情绪中穿上的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad countenance, and saying gravely -- "Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?" During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her then. I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met Adèle leaving the schoolroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使我吃惊的是，费尔法克斯太太神色忧伤地望着窗外，十分严肃地说：“爱小姐，请来用早餐好吗？”吃饭时她冷冷地一声不吭。但那时我无法替她解开疑团。我得等我主人来解释，所以她也只好等待了。我勉强吃了一点，便匆勿上了楼，碰见阿黛勒正离开读书室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“来，对我说声早安，”他说。我愉快地走上前。这回我所遇到的，不光是一句冷冰冰的话，或者是握一握手而已，而是拥抱和接吻。他那么爱我，抚慰我，显得既亲切又自然。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我会亲自把钻石项链套在你脖子上，把发箍戴在你额头——看上去会非常相配，因为大自然至少已把自己特有的高尚，烙在这个额头上了，简。而且我会把手镯按在纤细的手腕上，把戒指戴在仙女般的手指上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Don't flatter me."</div>

<div class="line_en">He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. "This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses for yourself. I told you we shall be married in four weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town. After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."</div>

Ten years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel as my comforter."</div>

<div class="line_en">I laughed at him as he said this. "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.

<div class="line_cn" title="我笑他这么说话。“我不是天使，”我断言，“就是到死也不会是。我是我自己。罗切斯特先生，你不该在我身上指望或强求天上才有的东西。你不会得到的，就像我无法从你那儿得到一样，而且我是一点也不指望的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I suppose your love will effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my dear master."</div>

<div class="line_en">The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it: no -- it should be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to two: these however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk. "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would yet see me glittering like a parterre."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在米尔科特度过的一段时间很有些折磨人。罗切斯特先生硬要我到一家丝绸货栈去，到了那里命令我挑选六件衣服。我讨厌这事儿，请求推迟一下。不行——现在就得办妥。经我拼命在他耳边恳求，才由六件减为两件。然而他发誓要亲自挑选些衣服。我焦急地瞧着他的目光在五颜六色的店铺中逡巡，最后落在一块色泽鲜艳、富丽堂皇的紫晶色丝绸上和一块粉红色高级缎子上。我又重新悄悄地告诉他，还不如马上给我买件金袍子和一顶银帽子。我当然决不会冒昧地去穿他选择的衣服。费了九牛二虎之力，（因为他像顽石一般固执）我才说服他换一块素静的黑色缎子和珠灰色的丝绸。“暂时可以凑乎了”他说。但他要让我看上去像花圃一样耀眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten -- the letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee. "It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now." And somewhat relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我庆幸自己出了丝绸货栈，随后又离开了一家珠宝店。他给我买的东西越多，我的脸颊也因为恼恨和堕落感而更加烧灼得厉害了。我再次进了马车，往后一靠坐了下来，心里热辣辣，身子疲惫不堪。这时我想起来了，随着光明和暗淡的岁月的流逝，我已完全忘却了我叔叔约翰．爱写给里德太太的信，忘了他要收养我让我成为他遗产继承人的打算。“如果我有那么一点儿独立财产的话。”我想，“说实在我会心安理得的。我绝不能忍受罗切斯特先生把我打扮成像玩偶一样，或者像第二个达那厄那样坐着，每天让金雨洒遍全身。我一到家就要写信到马德里，告诉我叔叔约翰，我要结婚了及跟谁结婚。如果我能期望有一天给罗切斯特先生带来一笔新增的财产，那我可以更好地忍受现在由他养起来了。”这么一想，心里便感到有些宽慰（这个想法那天没有实现），我再次大胆地与我主人兼恋人的目光相遇。尽管我避开他的面容和目光，他的目光却执拗地搜寻着我的。他微微一笑。我想他的微笑是一个苏丹在欣喜和多情的时刻，赐予他刚给了金银财宝的奴隶的。他的手一直在找寻我的手，我使劲握了它一下，把那只被满腔激情压红了的手甩了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I assured him I was naturally hard -- very flinty, and that he would often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet time to rescind it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我明确告诉他，我生就了硬心肠——硬如铁石，他会发现我经常如此。何况我决计在今后的四周中，让他看看我性格中倔强的一面。他应当完全明白，他订的是怎样的婚约，趁现在还来得及的时候把它取消。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He fretted, pished, and pshawed. "Very good," I thought; "you may fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am certain.

<div class="line_cn" title="他很恼火，嘴里呸呀啐的。“很好，”我想，“你高兴光火就光火，烦躁就烦躁吧，但我相信，这是对付你的最好办法。尽管我对你的喜欢，非言语所能表达，但我不愿落入多情善感的流俗，我要用这巧辩的锋芒，让你悬崖勒马。除此之外，话中带刺，有助于保持我们之间对彼此都很有利的距离。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet," "malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &amp;c. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. I laughed in my sleeve at his menaces. "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="别人在场的时候，我照例显得恭敬文雅，其他举动都没有必要。只有在晚上交谈时，才那么冲撞他，折磨他。他仍然那么钟一敲七点便准时把我叫去，不过在他跟前时，他不再满嘴“亲爱的”、“恶毒的精灵”、“宝贝儿”那样的甜蜜称呼了。用在我身上最好的字眼是“令人恼火的木偶”、“小妖精”、“小傻瓜”等等。如今我得到的不是抚慰，而是鬼脸；不是紧紧握手，而是拧一下胳膊；不是吻一下脸颊，而是使劲拉拉耳朵。这倒不错。眼下我确实更喜欢这种粗野的宠爱，而不喜欢什么温柔的表露。我发现费尔法克斯太太也赞成，而且已不再为我担忧了，因此我确信自己做得很对。与此同时，罗切斯特先生却口口声声说我把他折磨得皮包骨头了，并威胁在即将到来的某个时期，对我现在的行为狠狠报复。他的恫吓，我暗自觉得好笑。“现在我可以让你受到合乎情理的约束，”我思忖道，“我并不怀疑今后还能这么做，要是一种办法失效了，那就得另外再想出一种来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then, after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我得寸进尺，惹得他很恼火，随后趁他怒悻悻地退到屋子另一头的时候，站起来象往常那样自自然然、恭恭敬敬地说了声“祝你晚安，先生，”便溜出边门走掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这方式开了一个头，我便在整个观察期坚持下来了，而且大获成功。当然他悻悻然有些发火，但总的说来，我见他心情挺不错。而绵羊般的顺从，斑鸠似的多情，倒反而既会助长他的专横，又不能象现在这样取悦他的理智，满足他的常识，甚至投合他的趣味。">查看中文翻译</div>

My future husband was becoming to me my whole world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.</div>
