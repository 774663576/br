<div class="line_cn" title="不会。她去托尼家时，已经是打定主意了。如果她想要谁去阻止她，去救救她，那也是我。在聚会上。她清楚这点。">查看中文翻译</div>

And that's when I knew that she'd given me the second set of tapes. So I looked her up and called her house, but no one answered. So I called her parents' store. I asked if Hannah was there, and they asked if everything was all right because I'm sure I sounded crazy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以我回到家，听磁带的时候，放得很快。一直快放，想知道有没有我。没有我。那时我才明白她给我的就是第二套磁带。于是我找她，给她家打电话，可没人接。于是我给她爸妈店里打。我问汉娜在不在，他们问怎么啦，因为我知道我声音不对头。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sit on the curb, a few feet from where I vomited out of Tony's car. If whoever lives here, because I have no idea whose party it was, wants to come out and ask me to leave, I welcome it. Please do.</div>

Mostly seniors, of course. But for those of us who did go to school, the teachers let us know that if we simply forgot to bring a note from home, they wouldn't mark us absent if we wanted to attended the funeral.</div>
