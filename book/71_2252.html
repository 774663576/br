The two young men accepted; and then, wishing to make use of the intervening period, Albert left for Naples, while Franz remained in Florence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Near the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to fashionable Parisian society, Vicomte Albert de Morcerf and Baron Franz d'Epinay, found themselves in Florence. They had agreed that they would meet to spend that year's carnival together in Rome, where Franz, who had lived in Italy for nearly four years, would serve as Albert's guide.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had spent some time enjoying life in the city of the Medici, when he had walked back and forth in that Eden which is known as the Casini, when he had been a guest in the houses of those splendid hosts who do the honours of Florence, he took a fancy -- having already seen Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte -- to visit the island of Elba, that great staging-post in the life of Napoleon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since visiting Rome for the carnival is no small matter, especially when one does not intend to spend the night in the Piazza del Popolo or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, proprietor of the Hôtel de Londres in the Piazza di Spagna, to request him to reserve a comfortable suite for them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your Excellency is wrong. The same is true of pirates as of bandits, who were supposed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII, but who nonetheless stop travellers every day right up to the gates of Rome. Did you not hear that barely six months ago the French chargé d'affaires to the Holy See was robbed, five hundred yards from Velletri?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大人错啦，海盗是有的，正象现在还有强盗一样——大家不是都相信强盗已被教皇利奥十二世消灭了的吗？可是他们每天还在罗马的城门口抢劫旅客。大人难道没有听说过，六个月前，法国代理公使在离韦莱特里五百步以内被抢的那回事吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, if Your Excellency were to live in Leghorn, as we do, you would hear from time to time that a vessel laden with merchandise, or a pretty English yacht which was expected in Bastia, Porto Ferrajo or Civita Vecchia, has not made port, and that no one knows what has become of it, except that it has doubtless been wrecked on some rock. Well, the rock that it hit was a low narrow-boat, with six or eight men on board, which surprised it and pillaged it, some dark and stormy night off a wild, uninhabited island, just as bandits stop and pillage a mail coach at the entrance to a wood."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But in that case," said Franz, still lying back in the boat, "why don't the victims of these accidents complain and bring down the vengeance of the French, Tuscan or Sardinian governments on the head of the pirates?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，”裹紧了披风躺在小船里的弗兰士问道，“那些遭抢的人为什么不向法国，撒丁，或是托斯卡纳政府去控告呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because first of all they unload everything that is worth taking off the ship or the yacht and put it in their boat; then they tie the hands and feet of the crew, tie a cannonball round the neck of each man, make a hole as big as a barrel in the keel of the captured vessel, go back up on deck, batten down the hatches and return to their own boat. Ten minutes later, the ship starts to moan and groan, then bit by bit it founders. First one side, then the other goes under; then it rises up, then dips down again, slipping lower and lower each time. Suddenly, there is a noise like a cannon shot: that's the air bursting the deck. Then the vessel struggles like a drowning man, getting heavier with every movement that it makes. Soon the water, trapped under pressure inside, bursts out of every opening, like the spouting liquid from the air-holes of a gigantic whale. Finally it gives its death-cry, rolls over on itself and goes under, leaving a huge funnel in the deep which spins for an instant, then gradually fills and eventually disappears altogether. The result is that in five minutes only the eye of God Himself could see a trace of the vanished ship beneath the calm surface of the sea. Now do you understand," he added, smiling again, "why the ship does not return to port and the crew does not lodge a complaint?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为首先他们把帆船上一切他们认为值得拿的东西都搬到他们自己的小船上，然后他们把船员的手脚都绑起来，给每一个人的脖子上都绑上一个二十四磅重的铁球，在帆船底上凿一个大洞，然后他们就离开它。十分钟以后，那艘帆船就开始前后左右地摆荡起来，然后就往下沉，一会儿倾到这一边，一会儿倾到那一边。它沉浮了几次，突然间发出放大炮似的一声巨响——这是甲板里的空气爆炸了。不久，排水孔里就象鲸鱼的喷水口似的窜出水来，帆船发出最后一声呻吟，打几个转转，就不见了，只在海洋里造成了一个大漩涡，于是一切就完了。在五分钟之内，只有上帝的眼睛才能看到帆船究竟躺在海底的哪一角。你现在懂得了，”船长大笑着说，“为什么没有人向政府去控告，为什么帆船不到港的原因了吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, they were quickly nearing the end of the journey. They had a fresh wind in their sails and the boat was making six or seven knots. At their approach, the island seemed to rise up out of the sea. Through the clear atmosphere of the dying rays of the sun they could see, like cannonballs in an arsenal, the mass of rocks piled up, one above the other, with between them the dark red of the heather and the light green of the trees. Though the sailors appeared perfectly calm, it was clear that they were watchful, scanning the vast mirror across which the boat was slipping, its horizon interrupted only by the white sails of a few fishing boats which hovered like seagulls on the crests of the waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风势很猛，小船以每小时六七海里的速度航进。他们正在很迅速地接近航行的目的地。当他们接近那个岛的时候，它似乎象是从海底里升起来的一个庞然大物，透过薄暮余辉里的明净的天空，他们可以辨别出岩石一块靠一块地堆积着，象一座武器库里的炮弹一样，在石缝里，生长着青绿色的灌木和小树。至于水手们，在表面上虽然十分平静，但显然抱着戒心，正非常小心地注视着那展开在他们前面的玻璃一般光滑的海面。海面上只能看到几艘渔船和它们的白帆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were scarcely more than fifteen miles from Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica, the mountains of which rose up to their right, darkly serrated against the sky. The mass of stones rose threateningly in front of the boat, like the giant Adamastor, its crest gilded by the sun which was concealed behind it. Little by little the shadowy figure came up out of the sea and appeared to drive before it the last ray of the dying day, until at last the shaft of light was driven to the very tip of the cone, where it paused for a moment like the flaming plume of a volcano. Finally the darkness, still rising, progressively swept across the summit as it had previously swept across the base, and the island had only the appearance of a mountain, growing constantly a darker shade of grey. Half an hour later, everything was pitch black.</div>

<div class="line_en">Luckily the sailors were in familiar waters and knew every last rock in the Tuscan archipelago; otherwise, in the midst of this blackness that had enfolded the boat, Franz might not have been altogether easy in his mind. Corsica had vanished entirely and even the island of Monte Cristo had become invisible; but the sailors seemed to have the lynx's faculty of seeing in the dark, and the pilot, sitting at the rudder, did not show the slightest hesitation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸而海员们走惯这些航路，熟知托斯卡纳群岛一带的每一块礁石，因为在这样的昏黑之中，弗兰士并不是十分安心的。科西嘉早已不见了，基督山也不知隐在何处，但水手们却似乎象大山猫一样，能在暗中看物，而舵手也没有露出丝毫犹豫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About an hour had passed since sunset when Franz thought he could see a dark shape, about a quarter of a mile to the left. It was so difficult to distinguish what it could be that, rather than risking the sailors' mockery by mistaking some passing clouds for land, he said nothing. But suddenly a great light appeared on the shore: the land might resemble a cloud, but this fire was not a meteor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳落山以后又过去一个钟头了，弗兰士好象觉得在左手四分之一哩路那面看到一大堆黑压压的东西，但认不出那究竟是什么东西，而为了怕把一片浮云错认作陆地以致引起水手们的笑话，他依旧保持着沉默。突然间，岸上现出一大片光：陆地或许会象一片云，但火光却不会是一颗殒星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But surely," Franz said, "it seems to me that this fire should reassure us rather than otherwise. People who were afraid of being seen would not have lit a fire like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但这个火光，”弗兰士又说，“在我看来，倒不是使我们应该警戒而是应该使我们放心的，凡是不愿意被人看见的人是不会举火的呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's what we must find out," said Gaetano, keeping his eyes fixed on the terrestrial star.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那正是我们必须确定的事。”盖太诺回答，他的眼睛盯着这颗陆上的星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And pirates," said Gaetano, repeating Franz's words. "That's why I gave the order to sail past the island: as you can see, the fire is behind us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“并且还有海盗，”盖太诺把弗兰士的话重述一遍。“就为了那个理由，我才吩咐驶过那个岛，因为，您也可以看到，那火光是在我们的后面了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, that means nothing," said Gaetano. "If you could judge the position of the island in the darkness, you would see that the fire is sited in such a way that it cannot be seen from the coast, or from Pianosa, but only from the open sea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，这个理由不能成立，”盖太诺说。“假如您能在黑暗中猜到这个岛的方向，您就会知道，那一片火光从侧面或从皮亚诺扎岛那边看过去是望不见的，只有从海上才看得到。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this, Gaetano had a few words with his comrades and, after they had talked for five minutes, they carried out a manoeuvre which allowed them instantly to reverse their course. In this way they were sailing back in the direction from which they had come and, a few moments later, the fire disappeared, hidden behind some outcrop on the land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖太诺和他的伙计们开始商量。经过五分钟的讨论以后，就采取了一种行动，使小船掉过头来。他们朝来时的方向回转去，几分钟以后，火光不见了，已被一片隆起的高地遮住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this, the pilot altered course yet again with the rudder, and the little boat came visibly closer to the island, until it was only some fifty yards off-shore. Gaetano lowered the sail and the boat remained stationary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="舵手又改变小帆船的方向，船便急速地向岛靠拢去，不久就进入离岛五十步的距离之内。盖太诺扯落船帆，小船就不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gaetano, having suggested the expedition, had taken full responsibility for it on himself. The four sailors kept peering at him, preparing the oars and evidently getting ready to row to shore which, thanks to the darkness, was not difficult.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次远征行猎是盖太诺建议的，所以他自动负起全责。四个水手的眼睛都盯在他的身上，同时并把他们的桨准备好，以便随时可以划开去，关于这一点，靠了黑暗帮忙，大概是不难办到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for Franz, he was inspecting his weapons with the characteristic sang-froid we have mentioned. He had two double-barrelled guns and a rifle, which he loaded. Then he cocked them and waited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于弗兰士，他以极端冷静的态度检查了一下他的武器。他有两支双铳枪和一支马枪，他装上子弹，望着枪机，静静地等着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这一切都是在沉默中做完的，自从他们改变方向以来，就不曾说过一个字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile the master had taken off his shirt and jacket, and secured his trousers around his waist; as he was barefoot, he had no shoes or stockings to remove. Once dressed -- or, rather, undressed -- like this, he put his finger to his lips to show that they should observe complete silence and, after slipping gently into the sea, swam towards the shore, but so cautiously that they could not hear the slightest sound. His path could be followed only by the phosphorescent trail he left in his wake. Soon even this disappeared, and it was clear that Gaetano had reached land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，船长已脱掉他的背心和衬衫，紧了紧他的裤子；他本来是赤脚的，所以根本没有鞋袜可脱。这些步骤完成以后，他用手指放在嘴唇上作了一个要大家保持静默的暗号，就无声无息地滑入海里，极其小心地向岸边游过去，没有发出一丝最轻微的声音。只有从那条发磷光的水痕才能追踪到他。这道痕迹不久也不见了；显然他已到岸了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bless my soul!" said Gaetano, in tones of the most sincere Christian charity. "We are here to help one another, Excellency. Bandits are often hard-pressed on land by the gendarmes or the carabinieri, so they find a boat with good fellows like us in it. They come and request the hospitality of our floating house. How can one refuse to succour a poor devil with men on his tail? We take him in and, for greater safety, put out to sea. This costs us nothing and it saves the life -- or, at least, the freedom -- of one of our fellow men who, as it happens, acknowledges the service we have done him by showing us a good spot to put off our cargo where it is safe from prying eyes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉！”船长用基督教徒那种极其慈悲的口吻回答说，“我们应该永远互相帮助。强盗常常被宪兵或马枪兵逼得走投无路。嘿，他们看到一条小船，而船上是象我们这样的好人，他们就来要求我们庇护。对于一个被追得走投无路的可怜虫，你怎么能拒绝帮忙呢？我们就收留了他们。而为了更安全起见，我们就驶到海上来。这并不破费我们什么，但却救了一个同类人的性命，或至少是救了他的自由，而他，一有机会就会报告我们，指示一个安全地点，使我们可以把我们的货物顺顺利利地卸到岸上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For someone like Franz, who considered everything in its true light, the situation, while not dangerous, still gave pause for serious thought. He was here, in the most profound darkness, in the middle of the sea, with sailors who did not know him and who had no reason to be loyal to him; who, moreover, knew that he had a few thousand francs in his belt and who had ten times examined his guns, at least with curiosity, if not envy: they were fine pieces. In addition to that, escorted by only these men, he was about to land on an island which certainly had a very religious name, but which appeared to offer Franz no greater hospitality than Calvary did to Christ, in view of the smugglers and the bandits. Then those stories of scuttled ships, which he had thought exaggerated by day-light, seemed more believable in the dark. So, caught between this -- perhaps imaginary -- double danger, he did not take his eyes off the men or his hand off the rifle.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the first words of the song the men sitting around the fire got up and walked across to the landing-stage, keeping a close watch on the approaching boat so as to assess its size and intentions.

They carried on for about fifty paces more, clearly proceeding in the direction that had been forbidden to Gaetano, which explained why they had not wanted him to go there. Soon, from the change in the air, he realized that he was going underground and, after they had walked for a few more seconds, he heard a creaking sound and felt that the air had again changed, to become warm and scented.

<div class="line_en">As one may imagine, Franz did not wait to be asked again: he took off his handkerchief and found himself standing in front of a man of between thirty-eight and forty, wearing Tunisian dress, that is to say a red skullcap with a long blue silk tassel; a jacket in black woollen cloth embroidered all over with gold thread; wide, loose, dark-red trousers, with gaiters in the same colour, embroidered in gold like the jacket; and yellow Turkish slippers. Around his waist was a splendid cashmere belt with a sharp little curved dagger hanging from it.</div>

I should be much displeased at this, not because of any loss that it might occasion, but because I should no longer have the assurance that, whenever I wish, I can separate myself from the rest of the world.

<div class="line_en">"Now," the stranger told Franz, "I am not sure whether you agree with me, but I find nothing more irritating than to spend two or three hours with a person and not know by what name or title one should address him. Observe that I respect the laws of hospitality too much to ask you your name or title. I should just like to ask you to suggest some name or other which I might use when speaking to you. As for myself, to put you similarly at ease, I should tell you that people are accustomed to call me Sinbad the Sailor."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's very simple," the host replied. "It appears that the fellow had wandered closer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than is acceptable for a lad of his colour. In consequence he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue, his hand and his head cut off: the tongue on the first day, the hand on the second and the head on the third. I had always wanted to have a dumb servant. I waited for him to have his tongue cut out, then I went to offer the bey, in exchange for him, a splendid two-stroke repeating rifle which, on the previous day, had appeared to take His Highness's fancy. He hesitated a moment, so keen was he to make an end of this poor devil. But I added to the rifle an English hunting knife with which I had blunted His Highness's yataghan; as a result the bey decided to spare him his hand and his head, on condition that he never again set foot in Tunis. The stipulation was unnecessary. As soon as the miscreant catches sight of the African coast, he flees to the bottom of the hold and cannot be persuaded to come out until we have lost sight of the third quarter of the world."</div>

If you are a man of imagination, a poet, then taste this too, and the boundaries of the possible will vanish, the fields of infinity will be open and you will walk through them, free in heart, free in mind, in the limitless pasture of reverie. If you are ambitious and seek earthly glory, then you too can taste this and in an hour you will be a king, not the king of some little kingdom buried away in a corner of Europe, like France, Spain or England, but king of the world, king of the universe, king of creation. Your throne will be raised up on the mountain where Satan took Jesus. And, without having to pay him homage, without having to kiss his claw, you will be the sovereign master of all the kingdoms on earth. Aren't you tempted by my offer? Tell me, is it not an easy thing to do, since there is nothing to do but that? Look."</div>

What these fortunate young men imagined was reality was a dream; but a dream so sweet, so intoxicating, so voluptuous that they would sell themselves, body and soul, to the person who had procured it for them, obey his orders like those of God and strike whatever victim he directed at the furthest end of the earth, dying under torture without a murmur, simply because they believed that the death they would suffer was merely a transition to that life of delights of which the holy grass, which you see before you, had given them a foretaste."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Precisely; you have said the word, my lord Aladdin, it's hashish, the best and finest hashish of Alexandria, hashish from Abugour, the great maker, the only man, the man for whom they should build a palace with the following inscription: 'To the merchant of happiness, from a grateful world'."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是这个东西，一点不错，阿拉丁先生，这是大麻精，是亚历山大出产的最好最纯粹的大麻精，是阿波考调制的大麻精。阿波考是举世无双的制药圣手，我们应该给他建造一座宫殿，上面刻这样的几个字：‘全世界感恩的人士献给快乐贩卖者。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do so, my dear guest, do so. But do not be content with just one experiment: as with everything, the senses must become accustomed to a new impression, whether it is pleasant or not, happy or sad. Nature wrestles with this divine substance, because our nature is not made for joy but clings to pain. Nature must be defeated in this struggle, reality must follow dreams; and then the dream will rule, will become the master, the dream will become life and life become a dream. What a difference is made by this transfiguration! When you compare the sorrows of real life to the pleasures of the imaginary one, you will never want to live again, only to dream for ever. When you leave your world for that of others, you will feel as if you have travelled from spring in Naples to winter in Lapland, from paradise to earth, from heaven to hell. Try some hashish, my friend! Try it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您自己去判断吧，阿拉丁先生，判断吧，但切勿只尝试一次，象对其他一切事物一样，我们的感官对于任何新的印象，不论是温和的或猛烈的，悲哀的或愉快的，一定得尝试了多次才会习惯。人类的天性对这样圣物必须作一番争斗，人的天性生来不适宜于欢乐，只会紧紧地抱住痛苦。在这一场斗争中，天性一定会被克服，现实生活的后面一定紧接着梦，那时，梦统治了一切。那时，梦变成了生活，生活变成了梦。但以实际生活的痛苦和幻境里的欢乐比较起来，那种变化是多大呀！你不想再生活，只想永远地这样梦下去。当你从你的虚幻世界回到这个现世领域来的时候，你就象是离开那不勒斯的春天到了北极拉伯兰②的冬天——离开乐园到了尘世，离开天堂到了地狱！尝尝大麻精吧，我的客人，尝尝大麻精吧！”【注：②芬兰北部极寒冷的地方。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Franz, a strange transformation was taking place in him. All the physical tiredness of the day, all the concerns awakened in the mind by the events of the evening were disappearing as in that first moment of rest when one is still conscious enough to feel the arrival of sleep. His body seemed to acquire the lightness of some immaterial being, his mind became unimaginably clear and his senses seemed to double their faculties. The horizon was constantly receding; it was no longer that dark horizon which he had seen before falling asleep and over which a vague terror loomed, but a blue, transparent and vast horizon, containing all the blueness of the sea, all the sparkle of the sun and all the perfumes of the breezes. Then, in the midst of the songs of his sailors, songs that were so pure and so clear that they would have made the most divine harmonies if one could have noted them down, he saw the island of Monte Cristo appear, no longer like a threatening reef rising out of the waves but like an oasis lost in the desert; and, as the boat approached, the songs swelled in volume, because an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose towards heaven out of the island, as if some fairy, like Lorelei, or some enchanter, like Amphion, wanted to lure a soul towards it or to build a city there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于弗兰士，他的身体里面起了一种奇异的变化。白天肉体上的一切疲劳，傍晚脑子里被事态所引起的一切焦虑，都一起消失了，正象人们刚才入寐，而仍自知快要睡熟的时候一样。他的身体似乎轻飘飘的象空气一样，他的知觉变得非常敏捷，他的感官似乎增强了一倍力量。地平线不断地扩大，这不是他在睡觉以前所看到的那种在上空翱翔着一种漠然的，恐怖的，阴郁的地平线，而是一种蓝色的，透明的，无边无际的地平线，弥漫着海的全部蔚蓝，太阳的全部光辉，和夏季的微风的芬芳。然后，在水手们的歌声里——歌声是这样的响亮动听，要是能把他们的乐谱记下来，就成了一首神曲——他看到了基督山岛，它已不再是波涛汹涌中的一座吓人的岩山了，而是象流落在沙漠里的一片绿洲。当小船驶近去的时候，歌声更响了——因为岛上飘扬起一片令人心荡魂销的神秘的和声，直升天际，象是有一个罗莱①似的女妖或一个安菲翁②似的魔术家想引诱一个灵魂到那儿去筑起一座城池。【注：①罗莱是德国传说中的女妖，常往来于莱茵河畔的岩石中间，以其歌声引诱船夫触礁沉没。②安菲翁是希腊神话中的天帝宙斯之子，曾以笛声修建底比斯城，当他吹笛时，石头起舞，自动砌成屋室。】">查看中文翻译</div>

Here were those three great courtesans, Phryne, Cleopatra and Messalina; then, like a pure ray in the midst of these immodest shades, like a Christian angel among the gods of Olympus, came one of those chaste countenances, one of those calm shadows, one of those sweet visions that appeared to veil its virginal brow beside all these marble impurities.</div>

He went down a few steps, or seemed to do so, breathing a fresh and scented air such as must surround Circe's grotto, composed of perfumes that inspire the soul to dream and warmth such that the senses are inflamed by it; and he saw everything that he had seen before falling asleep, from Sinbad, his fantastic host, to Ali, the dumb servant. Then everything seemed to fade and become confused before his eyes, like the last rays of a magic lantern going out; and he found himself in the room with the statues, lit only by one of those dim antique lights that are kept burning at night to watch over sleep or voluptuous pleasures.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, he felt unremitting sensuality and continual love-making, such as the Prophet promised to the elect. Now all those stone mouths became living ones and those breasts became warm, to such an extent that for Franz, falling for the first time under the domain of hashish, this lust was almost pain and this voluptuousness almost torture, as he felt the lips of these statues, supple and cold as the coils of a viper, touching his parched mouth. But the more his arms tried to ward off this unknown embrace, the more his senses fell beneath the spell of this mysterious dream, so that, after a struggle in which he would have given his soul, he abandoned himself unreservedly and eventually fell back, panting, seared with exhaustion, worn out with lust, beneath the kisses of these marble mistresses and the enchantment of this unimaginable dream.</div>
