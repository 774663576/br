Then I saw this turtle swimming to the top and his beak was eating my tears as soon as they touched the water. He ate them quickly, five, six, seven tears, then climbed out of the pond, crawled onto a smooth rock and began to speak."</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Now you see,' said the turtle, drifting back into the pond, 'why it is useless to cry. Your tears do not wash away your sorrows. They feed someone else's joy. And that is why you must learn to swallow your own tears.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘现在你看！’那乌龟说着，又笃悠悠地回到水池内，‘哭有什么用呢？你的眼泪并不能洗尽你的悲伤，反而喂养了别人的欢乐，所以，你必需学会吞下自己的眼泪！’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then the turtle opened his beak and out poured five, six, seven pearly eggs. The eggs broke open and from them emerged seven birds, who immediately began to chatter and sing. I knew from their snow-white bellies and pretty voices that they were magpies, birds of joy. These birds bent their beaks to the pond and began to drink greedily. And when I reached out my hand to capture one, they all rose up, beat their black wings in my face, and flew up into the air, laughing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后这只乌龟把嘴一张，吐出一、二、三……一共七只珍珠般大小的蛋，然后蛋壳又毕剥一声一只只裂开，从里面钻出七只小鸟。它们一出壳就开始啁啾着曼声歌唱，无忧无虑地。那雪白的肚皮和动听的歌声，我猜出它们是喜鹊，那种专门给人们捎来喜讯的喜鹊。当我伸手想逮住其中一只时，它们都扑打着翅膀一只只扬翅飞走了，在空中留下一长串快乐的叫声。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But when the fifth day came, as we sailed closer toward the Tientsin gulf, the waters changed from muddy yellow to black and the boat began to rock and groan. I became fearful and sick. And at night I dreamed of the eastward-flowing stream my aunt had warned me about, the dark waters that changed a person forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但到了第五天，船开始驶近天津港，黄浊的水波不时拍打着船舷，随着天津港的靠近，水波的颜色开始变深，最后变成黑糊糊的，而且，船身开始剧烈地晃动着。我觉得害怕，而且恶心。这污黑的水流，让我忆起舅母所说的：把自己的脸皮扔入大海里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the morning of the day we were supposed to arrive in Tientsin, she went into our sleeping cabin wearing her white Chinese mourning dress. And when she returned to the sitting room on the top deck, she looked like a stranger. Her eyebrows were painted thick at the center, then long and sharp at the corners. Her eyes had dark smudges around them and her face was pale white, her lips dark red. On top of her head, she wore a small brown felt hat with one large brown-speckled feather swept across the front. Her short hair was tucked into this hat, except for two perfect curls on her forehead that faced each other like black lacquer carvings. She had on a long brown dress with a white lace collar that fell all the way to her waist and was fastened down with a silk rose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们到达天津的那天早上，她穿着一身中国式的孝服，可待快靠岸时，她再回到顶屋甲板的起居室时，却似完全换了个人。她描了浓浓的眉毛，各向两鬓高高地挑上去，还涂着黑眼圈，衬着那张脸越发显得苍白，再配着二片血红的嘴唇，显得完全是个陌生女人了。她戴着一顶棕色小毡帽，帽檐上横插着一支棕色羽毛，前额上，垂着两排整齐的刘海，远看就像一对漆器的木雕品，身上穿着一件领口上镶着直垂至腰间的白花边的棕色长裙，腰际别着一朵绢制红玫瑰。">查看中文翻译</div>

And my thoughts, too, became cloudy and confused.</div>

My mother gave quick instructions to our porter, pointed to our two small trunks and handed him money, as if she had done this every day of her life.

In the evening, when there was nothing to do, we talked about the servants: who was clever, who was diligent, who was loyal.

He was a big man, not tall, but puffed out like a bird. He was much older than my mother, with a high shiny forehead and a large black mole on one nostril. He wore a Western suit jacket with a vest that closed too tightly around his stomach, but his pants were very loose. He groaned and grunted as he heaved himself out and into view. And as soon as his shoes touched the ground, he began to walk toward the house, acting as though he saw no one, even though people greeted him and were busy opening doors, carrying his bags, taking his long coat. He walked into the house like that, with this young girl following him. She was looking behind at everyone with a simpering smile, as if they were there to honor her. And when she was hardly in the door, I heard one servant remark to another, "Fifth Wife is so young she did not bring any of her own servants, only a wet nurse."</div>

But after the first year of marriage, First Wife had given birth to a girl with one leg too short. And this misfortune led First Wife to begin a trek to Buddhist temples, to offer alms and tailored silk gowns in honor of Buddha's image, to burn incense and pray to Buddha to lengthen her daughter's leg. As it happened, Buddha chose instead to bless First Wife with another daughter, this one with two perfect legs, but -- alas!-- with a brown tea stain splashed over half her face. With this second misfortune, First Wife began to go on so many pilgrimages to Tsinan, just a half-day's train ride to the south, that Wu Tsing bought her a house near the Thousand Buddha Cliff and Bubbling Springs Bamboo Grove. And every year he increased the allowance she needed to manage her own household there. So twice a year, during the coldest and hottest months of the year, she returned to Tientsin to pay her respects and suffer sight unseen in her husband's household. And each time she returned, she remained in her bedroom, sitting all day like a Buddha, smoking her opium, talking softly to herself. She did not come downstairs for meals. Instead she fasted or ate vegetarian meals in her room. And Wu Tsing would make a mid-morning visit in her bedroom once a week, drinking tea for half an hour, inquiring about her health. He did not bother her at night.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wake up!" I whispered, and then I turned and saw everybody standing there: Wu Tsing, Yan Chang, Second Wife, Third Wife, Fifth Wife, the doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“醒醒吧，妈妈。”我哭了。然后我转过身看到所有人都站在那里：吴青、杨妈、二姨太、三姨太、五姨太和医生围在她床边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She has taken too much opium," cried Yan Chang. "The doctor says he can do nothing. She has poisoned herself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她吞吃了过量的鸦片，”杨妈哭着说，“医生说，已没有办法了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I watched my mother march in her bed. I wanted to say the words that would quiet her body and spirit. But I stood there like the others, waiting and saying nothing. And then I recalled her story about the little turtle, his warning not to cry. And I wanted to shout to her that it was no use. There were already too many tears. And I tried to swallow them one by one, but they came too fast, until finally my closed lips burst open and I cried and cried, then cried all over again, letting everybody in the room feed on my tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲继续在作着痛苦的抽搐，我想这时，我该说些令她肉体和灵魂都能安宁的话语，但我却一个字也说不出来，只是木头样呆呆地站着。我又忆起母亲讲过的乌龟的故事。她叮嘱过我，哭是最没有用的，我试着吞下自己咸涩的眼泪，一滴一滴的，但我的眼泪太多，涕泪滂沦的我，终于哭倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they were doing nothing, only waiting. I also waited those many hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他们什么也没做，只是在等待。我也等了那么多小时。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only sounds were that of the girl in the clock playing the violin. And I wanted to shout to the clock and make its meaningless noise be silent, but I did not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四周死一样地静寂，唯有那架大木钟，里面窜出那个拉小提琴的姑娘，奏出一串重复的令我厌倦的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I fainted with all this grief and they carried me back to Yan Chang's bed. So that morning, while my mother was dying, I was dreaming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我伤心得晕倒了，他们把我抱回了杨妈的床上。所以那天早上，当我妈妈快死的时候，我在做梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was falling from the sky down to the ground, into a pond. And I became a little turtle lying at the bottom of this watery place. Above me I could see the beaks of a thousand magpies drinking from the pond, drinking and singing happily and filling their snow-white bellies. I was crying hard, so many tears, but they drank and drank, so many of them, until I had no more tears left and the pond was empty, everything as dry as sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从天上掉到地上，掉进池塘里。我变成了一只小乌龟躺在水底。在我的上方，我可以看到一千只喜鹊的喙在池塘里喝水，高兴地喝着歌，填着雪白的肚子。我哭得很厉害，流了那么多眼泪，但他们又喝又喝，流了那么多，直到我没有眼泪了，池塘里空空如也，一切都干得像沙子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I know my mother listened to her own heart, to no longer pretend. I know this because why else did she die two days before the lunar new year? Why else did she plan her death so carefully that it became a weapon?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道，母亲是真的不想活下去了。她是故意选定小年夜自杀的。死对她，变成一种武器？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yan Chang later told me my mother had listened to Second Wife and tried to do pretend-suicide. False words! Lies! She would never listen to this woman who caused her so much suffering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过后杨妈告诉我，我母亲是听信了二姨太的教唆，吞生鸦片作假自杀，结果弄假成真了。不是的，完全不是的，她才不会上这个坏女人当。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three days before the lunar new year, she had eaten ywansyau, the sticky sweet dumpling that everybody eats to celebrate. She ate one after the other. And I remember her strange remark. "You see how this life is. You cannot eat enough of this bitterness." And what she had done was eat ywansyau filled with a kind of bitter poison, not candied seeds or the dull happiness of opium as Yan Chang and the others had thought. When the poison broke into her body, she whispered to me that she would rather kill her own weak spirit so she could give me a stronger one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在农历新年的前三天，她把毒药拌在元宵里吞下去了。记得她在吃元宵时，还感慨地说过：“唉，人生，究竟是怎么回事？就是一长串吃不尽的痛苦。”她所做的只是吃了满满一种苦味的毒药，而不是像杨妈和其他人所想的那种糖衣炮弹或鸦片的沉闷幸福。当毒药侵入她的身体时，她低声对我说，她宁愿杀死自己虚弱的灵魂，这样她才能给我一个更强大的灵魂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The stickiness clung to her body. They could not remove the poison and so she died, two days before the new year. They laid her on a wooden board in the hallway. She wore funeral clothes far richer than those she had worn in life. Silk undergarments to keep her warm without the heavy burden of a fur coat. A silk gown, sewn with gold thread. A headdress of gold and lapis and jade. And two delicate slippers with the softest leather soles and two giant pearls on each toe, to light her way to nirvana.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="元宵把毒药黏在她身子里，她无法得救。在小年夜当晚，他们把她停放在过道的一块木板上，她装裹得十分豪华，比生前还要奢丽体面，戴着纯金和琉璃白玉缀成的头冠，鞋尖两端各缀着两颗硕大的珍珠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because we both knew this: that on the third day after someone dies, the soul comes back to settle scores. In my mother's case, this would be the first day of the lunar new year. And because it is the new year, all debts must be paid, or disaster and misfortune will follow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按习俗，人死后的第三天，灵魂将回来讨还宿怨，母亲殁于小年夜，她的灵魂，将在大年初一来上门讨债。因此那天，吴青很有点神色不安，他戴了重孝，应诺将小弟和我，视为正出，也应诺将母亲作为明媒正娶的夫人看待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seeing her this last time, I threw myself on her body. And she opened her eyes slowly. I was not scared. I knew she could see me and what she had finally done. So I shut her eyes with my fingers and told her with my heart: I can see the truth, too. I am strong, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在最后与她诀别时，我扑上去大哭。她的双眼慢慢睁开了，我一点也不惧怕。我知道她是不放心我。我用手将她眼睛轻轻合拢，心里暗暗对她说：“我会坚强起来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So on that day, Wu Tsing, fearful of my mother's vengeful spirit, wore the coarsest of white cotton mourning clothes. He promised her visiting ghost that he would raise Syaudi and me as his honored children. He promised to revere her as if she had been First Wife, his only wife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以那天，吴青害怕母亲的鬼魂报复，穿上了最粗糙的白棉布丧服。他向来访的鬼魂保证，他会把我和小弟弟抚养成他的光荣孩子。他答应要尊敬她，就好像她是他的大姨太，他唯一的妻子一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And on that day, I showed Second Wife the fake pearl necklace she had given me and crushed it under my foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也豁出去了。反正那天，我给二姨太看了被妈踩碎的那串假珍珠项链。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother, she suffered. She lost her face and tried to hide it. She found only greater misery and finally could not hide that. There is nothing more to understand. That was China. That was what people did back then. They had no choice. They could not speak up. They could not run away. That was their fate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的母亲，她吃尽了苦头，丢尽了脸。她想千方百计地隐藏着这一切，而最后，这一切又汇成压倒她的更大的痛苦。那就是从前的中国。她们没有选择，不能反抗，也无处逃避，一切都认为是命定的。不过现在她们不一样了，这是最近的中国杂志上说的，她们翻身了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You do not need a psychiatrist to do this. A psychiatrist does not want you to wake up. He tells you to dream some more, to find the pond and pour more tears into it. And really, he is just another bird drinking from your misery.</div>

<div class="line_en">But now they can do something else. Now they no longer have to swallow their own tears or suffer the taunts of magpies. I know this because I read this news in a magazine from China.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但现在他们可以做点别的了。现在他们不必再忍着眼泪，也不必忍受喜鹊的嘲笑。我知道这件事是因为我在一本中国杂志上读到了这条新闻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It said that for thousands of years birds had been tormenting the peasants. They flocked to watch peasants bent over in the fields, digging the hard dirt, crying into the furrows to water the seeds. And when the people stood up, the birds would fly down and drink the tears and eat the seeds. So children starved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="据说几千年来鸟一直在折磨农民。他们成群结队地看着农民弯腰在地里挖土，在犁沟里哭着给种子浇水。当人们站起来时，鸟儿会飞下来，喝眼泪，吃种子。所以孩子们饿死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But one day, all these tired peasants -- from all over China -- they gathered in fields everywhere. They watched the birds eating and drinking. And they said, "Enough of this suffering and silence!" They began to clap their hands, and bang sticks on pots and pans and shout, "Sz! Sz! Sz!"-- Die! Die! Die!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是有一天，这些来自中国各地的疲惫的农民们聚集在各地的田地里。他们看着鸟儿吃喝。他们说：“受够了这种痛苦和沉默！”他们开始拍手，用棍子敲锅碗瓢盆，喊道：“死！死！死！”——死！死！死！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And all these birds rose in the air, alarmed and confused by this new anger, beating their black wings, flying just above, waiting for the noise to stop. But the people's shouts only grew stronger, angrier. The birds became more exhausted, unable to land, unable to eat. And this continued for many hours, for many days, until all those birds -- hundreds, thousands, and then millions!-- fluttered to the ground, dead and still, until not one bird remained in the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有这些鸟儿都站在空中，被这新的愤怒惊惶失措，拍打着它们的黑色翅膀，飞到正上方，等待着声音停止。但是人们的喊声越来越强烈，越来越愤怒。鸟儿们变得更加精疲力尽，无法降落，无法进食。这种情况持续了好几个小时，好几天，直到那些鸟成百上千，然后成百上千万！—飞到地上，死气沉沉，直到没有一只鸟留在空中。">查看中文翻译</div>
