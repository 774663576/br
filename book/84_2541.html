<div class="line_en">Shawn drove for days with little sleep, navigating our fifty-foot trailer as if it were his own arm. He doctored the books whenever we crossed a checkpoint, to make it seem he was getting more sleep than he was. Every other day we stopped to shower and eat a meal that wasn't dried fruit and granola.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn hated trucking long-haul, but he said he'd do it if I came along. Dad didn't need me in the junkyard, and Randy could spare me for a few days, so we set off, heading down to Las Vegas, then east to Albuquerque, west to Los Angeles, then up to Washington State. I'd thought I would see the cities, but mostly I saw truck stops and interstate. The windshield was enormous and elevated like a cockpit, which made the cars below seem like toys. The sleeper cab, where the bunks were, was musty and dark as a cave, littered with bags of Doritos and trail mix.</div>

It's about knowing where the weak points are, and how to exploit them." He grabbed my wrist and folded it, bending my fingers downward so they reached uncomfortably toward the inside of my forearm. He continued to add pressure until I twisted slightly, wrapping my arm behind my back to relieve the strain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“会了这一招，”他说，“你就能用最小的力气让一个人丧失行动能力。只需两根手指头你就能控制一个人的整个身体。首先要搞清楚对方的薄弱点在哪里，再就是如何利用它们。”他抓住我的手腕折叠起来，把我的手指向下掰，让它们不舒服地伸向前臂内侧。他持续施力，直到我轻轻扭动，将胳膊绕在背后以减轻受力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Near Albuquerque, the Walmart warehouse was backed up and couldn't unload us for two days. We were outside the city -- there was nothing but a truck stop and red sand stretching out in all directions -- so we ate Cheetos and played Mario Kart in the sleeper. By sunset on the second day, our bodies ached from sitting, and Shawn said he should teach me martial arts. We had our first lesson at dusk in the parking lot.</div>

We climbed into the truck, picked up a new load and drove for another two days, watching the white lines disappear hypnotically beneath the hood, which was the color of bone. We had few forms of entertainment, so we made a game of talking. The game had only two rules. The first was that every statement had to have at least two words in which the first letters were switched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，拖车上的货卸完了。我们爬上卡车，又装了一批新货，连续开了两天车，看着引擎盖下方骨白色的线慢慢消失，昏昏欲睡。由于几乎没有什么娱乐活动，我们发明了一个说话游戏。游戏只有两条规则：首先每句话必须至少有两个词，两个单词中的第一个字母要调换位置。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sadie started dropping by the junkyard around quitting time, usually with a milkshake for Shawn, or cookies or cake. Shawn hardly even spoke to her, just grabbed whatever she'd brought him and kept walking toward the corral. She would follow and try to talk to him while he fussed over his horses, until one evening she asked if he would teach her to ride. I tried to explain that our horses weren't broke all the way, but she was determined, so Shawn put her on Apollo and the three of us headed up the mountain. Shawn ignored her and Apollo. He offered none of the help he'd given me, teaching me how to stand in the stirrups while going down steep ravines or how to squeeze my thighs when the horse leapt over a branch. Sadie trembled for the entire ride, but she pretended to be enjoying herself, restoring her lipsticked smile every time he glanced in her direction.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sadie came to our house every day after school, and I watched the Snickers incident play out over and over, in different forms, with different objects. Shawn would ask for a glass of water. When Sadie brought it, he'd want ice. When she brought that he'd ask for milk, then water again, ice, no ice, then juice. This could go on for thirty minutes before, in a final test, he would ask for something we didn't have. Then Sadie would drive to town to buy it -- vanilla ice cream, fries, a burrito -- only to have him demand something else the moment she got back. The nights they went out, I was grateful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赛迪每天放学后都来我们家，我看着士力架事件一遍又一遍地上演，只不过形式不同，物品也换了。肖恩会要一杯水喝。赛迪端过水来，他又说想要冰块。等她拿来冰块，他又要牛奶，接着又要水，冰，不加冰，然后要果汁。这个过程可能持续半个钟头，在最后测试环节，他会要我们家没有的东西。赛迪便会开车去镇上买——香草冰激凌、薯条、玉米煎饼——等她一回来，他只会要别的东西。我很感激他们俩出门的那些夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I watched his face harden, then relax. He smiled at me. "I have the perfect punishment," he said. "I simply won't see her. All I have to do is not see her, and she will suffer."</div>

<div class="line_en">One night, he came home late and in a strange mood. Everyone was asleep except me, and I was on the sofa, reading a chapter of scripture before bed. Shawn plopped down next to me. "Get me a glass of water."</div>

<div class="line_en">He was right. When he didn't return her calls, Sadie became desperate. She told the boys at school not to walk with her, for fear Shawn would see, and when Shawn said he disliked one of her friends, she stopped seeing them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说得没错。他不回她的电话，赛迪感到绝望。因为担心被肖恩发现，她告诉男同学们不要和她同行。当肖恩说不喜欢她的某个朋友，她就不再和那个人见面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I fetched the water. As I handed it over, I saw the smile on his face and without thinking dumped the whole thing on his head. I made it down the hall and was nearly to my room when he caught me.</div>

<div class="line_en">He grabbed a fistful of my hair, a large clump, his grip fixed near the root to give him greater leverage, and dragged me into the bathroom. I groped at the door, catching hold of the frame, but he lifted me off the ground, flattened my arms against my body, then dropped my head into the toilet. "Apologize," he said again. I said nothing. He stuck my head in further, so my nose scraped the stained porcelain. I closed my eyes, but the smell wouldn't let me forget where I was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一把抓住我的头发，一大团，紧紧揪着发根，将我拖进卫生间。我摸到门，抱住门框，但他把我从地上扛起来，让我的胳膊紧贴身体，然后将我的头塞进了马桶。“道歉。”他又说了一遍。我一声不吭。他把我的头往里按，于是我的鼻子碰到了污渍斑斑的马桶陶瓷。我闭上眼睛，但气味无法让我忘记自己身在何处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I tried to imagine something else, something that would take me out of myself, but the image that came to mind was of Sadie, crouching, compliant. It pumped me full of bile. He held me there, my nose touching the bowl, for perhaps a minute, then he let me up. The tips of my hair were wet; my scalp was raw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我试着想象一些别的东西，一些能让我忘记现状的东西，但脑海中浮现的是赛迪点头哈腰的顺从样子。这个画面让我愤怒不已。他按住我，我的鼻子碰着便池，大约一分钟后他才让我站起来。我的发梢都湿了，头皮生疼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought it was over. I'd begun to back away when he seized my wrist and folded it, curling my fingers and palm into a spiral. He continued folding until my body began to coil, then he added more pressure, so that without thinking, without realizing, I twisted myself into a dramatic bow, my back bent, my head nearly touching the floor, my arm behind my back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我以为事情结束了。我刚要走开，他抓住我的手腕，一个折叠，将我的手指和手掌卷成螺旋状。他不停地拧，直到我的身体蜷缩起来，然后他加大力气，让我不自觉地把自己扭成一个夸张的弓状，弯着腰，背着手，头几乎碰到地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the parking lot, when Shawn had shown me this hold, I'd moved only a little, responding more to his description than to any physical necessity. It hadn't seemed particularly effective at the time, but now I understood the maneuver for what it was: control. I could scarcely move, scarcely breathe, without breaking my own wrist. Shawn held me in position with one hand; the other he dangled loosely at his side, to show me how easy it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上次在停车场肖恩给我演示这个动作时，我只是稍微动了一下，更多是为了配合他的描述，而不是身体需要。当时这一招似乎并不特别奏效，但现在我明白了它的作用：控制。为了不让手腕折断，我几乎不敢动弹，也不敢呼吸。肖恩用一只手将我固定住，另一只手在身旁轻松地晃来晃去，向我炫耀这对他有多容易。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As if he could read my mind, he twisted my wrist further; my body was coiled tightly, my face scraping the floor. I'd done all I could do to relieve the pressure in my wrist. If he kept twisting, it would break.</div>

<div class="line_en">He dropped my wrist and I fell to the floor. I could hear his steps moving down the hall. I stood and quietly locked the bathroom door, then I stared into the mirror at the girl clutching her wrist. Her eyes were glassy and drops slid down her cheeks. I hated her for her weakness, for having a heart to break. That he could hurt her, that anyone could hurt her like that, was inexcusable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他松开了我的手腕，我倒在地上。我听见他的脚步声穿过了门厅。我站起身来，悄悄地锁上卫生间的门，然后盯着镜子里那个紧握手腕的女孩。她两眼无神，泪珠从脸颊上滑落。我恨她的软弱，恨她有一颗易碎的心。他能伤害她，任何人都能那样伤害她，这不可原谅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This moment would define my memory of that night, and of the many nights like it, for a decade. In it I saw myself as unbreakable, as tender as stone. At first I merely believed this, until one day it became the truth. Then I was able to tell myself, without lying, that it didn't affect me, that he didn't affect me, because nothing affected me. I didn't understand how morbidly right I was. How I had hollowed myself out. For all my obsessing over the consequences of that night, I had misunderstood the vital truth: that its not affecting me, that was its effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一刻定义了我对那一晚的记忆，以及之后长达十年之久很多类似的夜晚的记忆。在这样的记忆中，我看到的是一个坚不可摧、像石头一样难以对付的自己。起初我仅仅是让自己相信这一点，直到有一天它变成了现实。然后我才能坦诚地告诉自己，这对我没有影响，他没有影响到我，因为没有什么可以影响我。我不明白我的这种正确是多么病态，不明白自己是如何掏空了自己。尽管我一直被那晚的后果所困扰，但我误解了最重要的事实：它没有影响我，这本身就是它的影响。">查看中文翻译</div>
