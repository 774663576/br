<div class="line_en">Watching her run, he couldn't help but notice how beautiful she was. Her flowing hair reflected the light of the high yellow sun, her legs were lean and moving rhythmically, effortlessly. Her smile, despite the fact she was running, looked easy and relaxed, as if she were standing still.</div>

<div class="line_en">Four days after Theresa left Wilmington, Garrett had another dream, only this time it was about Catherine. In the dream they were in a grassy field bordered by a cliff overlooking the ocean. They were walking together, holding hands and talking, when Garrett said something that made her laugh. All at once she broke away from him. Looking over her shoulder and laughing, she called for Garrett to chase her. He did, laughing as well, feeling much as he had the day they were married.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was slowly gaining on her when he noticed that she was heading toward the cliff. In her excitement and joy, she didn't seem to realize where she was going.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sound of laughter after she said it floated in the air around him, sounding musical.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Chase me, Garrett. Can you catch me?" she called.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a feeling of certain dread, he saw that he was still too far behind her to catch her.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that's ridiculous, he thought. She has to know.</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett called for her to stop, but instead she began to run faster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He ran as fast as he could, screaming for her to turn around. She didn't appear to hear him. He felt the adrenaline rush through his body, fed by a paralyzing fear. "Stop, Catherine!" he shouted, his lungs exhausted. "The cliff-you're not watching where you're going!" The more he shouted, the softer his voice became, until it turned into a whisper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catherine kept on running, unaware. The cliff was only a few feet away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was closing ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stop!" he screamed again, though this time he knew she couldn't hear it. His voice had diminished to nothing. The panic he felt then was greater than anything he'd ever known. With everything he had, he willed his legs to move faster, but they began to tire, turning heavier with every step he took.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stood only inches from the edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, just as suddenly as she had broken away, she stopped. Turning to face him, she seemed oblivious of any danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smiled and glanced behind her. Noticing how close she was to falling, she turned toward him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't move," he shouted, but again it came out in a whisper. He stopped a few feet from her and held out his hand, breathing heavily.</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett woke and sat up in bed, staying awake for several hours afterward. When he finally fell back to sleep, it was fitful at best, and it was almost ten o'clock the next morning before he was able to get up. Still exhausted and feeling depressed, he found it impossible to think about anything but the dream. Not knowing what to do, he called his father, who met him for breakfast in their usual place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did you think you were going to lose me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's not like she did anything to upset me," he continued. "We just spent a long weekend together, and I really care for her. I met her son, too, and he's great. It's just that… I don't know I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep this up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know why I feel this way," he told his father after a few minutes of small talk. "I just don't understand it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe it's just not meant to be. I mean, she doesn't even live here. She's a thousand miles away, she's got her own life, she's got her own interests. And here I am, living down here and leading an entirely separate life. Maybe she'd do better with someone else, someone she could see on a regular basis."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His father didn't answer. Instead he watched his son over his coffee cup, remaining silent as his son went on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Keep what up?" Jeb Blake finally asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I just don't see how we can make it work. I've thought about it a lot, and I don't see how it could be possible. I don't want to move to Boston, and I'm sure she doesn't want to move here, so where would that leave us?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett stopped and waited for his father to say something-anything-in response to what he'd said up to that point. But for a while, he didn't make a sound. Finally he sighed and looked away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It sounds to me like you're making excuses," Jeb said quietly. "You're trying to convince yourself, and you're using me to listen to yourself talk."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who do you think you're talking to, Garrett?" Jeb Blake shook his head. "Sometimes, I swear you think I just fell off the turnip truck and bumbled through life without learning anything along the way. But I know exactly what you're going through. You've gotten so caught up in being alone that you're afraid of what might happen if you actually find someone else that can take you away from it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The disappointment in his tone was unmistakable. "You know, Garrett, when your mom died, I made excuses, too. Over the years, I told myself all sorts of things. And you wanna know where it got me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stared at his son. "I'm old and tired, and most of all, I'm alone. If I could go back in time, I'd change a lot about myself, and I'll be damned if I'm going to let you do the same things I did."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jeb paused before going on, his tone softening. "I was wrong, Garrett. I was wrong not to try to find someone else. I was wrong to feel guilty about your mom. I was wrong to keep living my life the way I did, always suffering inside and wondering what she would have thought. Because you know what? I think your mom would have wanted me to find someone else. Your mom would have wanted me to be happy. And you know why?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Garrett spent the rest of the afternoon alone, walking on the beach, thinking about what his father had said. Looking back, he knew he'd been dishonest from the start of the conversation and wasn't surprised that his father had figured it out. Why, then, had he wanted to talk to him? Had he wanted his father to confront him as he had?</div>

<div class="line_en">"You didn't mess up…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I must have. Because when I look at you, I see myself, and to be honest, I'd rather see someone different. I'd like to see someone who learned that it's okay to go on, that it's okay to find someone that can make you happy. But right now, it's like I'm looking in the mirror and seeing myself twenty years ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because she loved me. And if you think that you're showing your love to Catherine by suffering the way you've been doing, then somewhere along the way, I must have messed up in raising you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the afternoon wore on, his depression gave way to confusion, then to a sort of numbness. By the time he called Theresa later in the evening, the feelings of betrayal he'd felt as a result of the dream had subsided enough to speak with her. They were still there, though not as strong, and when she answered the phone, he felt them diminish even further. The sound of her voice reminded him of the way he felt when they were together.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the days passed, the image of the dream began to fade. Each time Garrett talked to Theresa, he found himself feeling a little more renewed. He also spoke to Kevin a couple of times, and his enthusiasm for Garrett's presence in their lives helped him regain his footing as well. Even though the heat and humidity of August seemed to make time pass more slowly than usual, he kept himself as busy as he could, doing his best not to think about the complexities of his new situation.</div>

<div class="line_en">More than once, Garrett found himself wondering why the last three weeks had been so difficult for him. He knew that part of his anxiety stemmed from the dream, but spending time with Theresa made the dream's troubling feelings seem distant and insubstantial. Every time Theresa laughed or squeezed his hand, she reaffirmed the feelings he'd had when she was last in Wilmington, banishing the dark thoughts that plagued him in her absence.</div>

<div class="line_en">After picking him up from the airport, Theresa showed him around the city. They had lunch at Faneuil Hall, watched the skullers gliding on the Charles River, and took a quick tour of the Harvard campus. As usual, they held hands most of the day, reveling in each other's company.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have a nice place," he said, forking up some beans with a tortilla chip. "For some reason, I thought it would be smaller than it is. It's bigger than my house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the day began to cool and the sun dipped below the trees, Theresa and Garrett stopped for some Mexican food to bring back to her apartment. Sitting on her living room floor in the glow of candlelight, Garrett looked around the room.</div>

Plus, there's all the research I have to do, especially when I write about medical or psychological issues, and when I'm in the office, I have access to a lot more sources. And then there's the fact that I need a place where I can be reached. A lot of the stuff I do is human interest, and I get calls from people all day long.

<div class="line_en">When they were together during those weekends, it was as if nothing else mattered in the world. Usually Kevin would spend one of the nights at a friend's house so they could be alone, at least for a little while. They spent hours talking and laughing, holding each other close, and making love, trying to make up for weeks spent apart. Yet neither of them broached the subject of what was going to happen to their relationship in the future. They lived moment to moment, neither of them exactly sure of what to expect from the other. Not that they weren't in love. Of that, at least, they were certain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Working around each other's schedules, they were able to get together three more times, each time for a weekend. Once, Theresa flew down to Wilmington so they could be alone, and they spent their time holed up in Garrett's house, except for an evening they spent sailing. Garrett traveled to Boston twice, spending much of his time on the road for Kevin's soccer tournaments, though he hadn't minded. They were the first soccer games he'd ever attended, and he found himself caught up in the action more than he thought he would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the next two months, their long-distance relationship began to evolve in a way that neither Theresa nor Garrett expected though both should have foreseen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How come you're not as excited as I am?" he'd asked Theresa during one particularly frenzied moment on the field.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why don't you wait until you've seen a few hundred games, and then I'm sure you could answer your own question," she'd replied playfully.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, he wanted them to spend more time together than was possible. Now that summer had passed, it was easier for him to get away than it was for her. Even with most of the employees gone, there wasn't much to do around the shop. But Theresa's schedule was completely different, if only because of Kevin. He was in school again, he had tournaments on the weekends, and it was difficult for her to break away, even for a few days. Although Garrett was willing to visit Boston to see her more often, Theresa simply didn't have the time. More than once he'd suggested another trip up to see her, but for one reason or another, it hadn't worked out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But because they didn't see each other very often, their relationship had more ups and downs than either of them had experienced before. Since everything felt right when they were together, everything felt wrong when they weren't. Garrett, especially, found himself struggling with the distance between them. Usually the good feelings he'd had when they saw each other lasted for a few days afterward, but then he'd find himself growing depressed as he anticipated the weeks before he saw her again.</div>

<div class="line_en">True, he knew there were couples who faced living situations more difficult than theirs. His father told him stories of how he and his mother hadn't spoken for months at a time. He'd gone to Korea and spent two years with the marines, and when times were tough in the shrimping business, he used to find work with passing freighters on their way to South America. Sometimes those trips lasted months. The only thing his parents had during those times were letters, which were infrequent at best.

<div class="line_en">He had his own business in Wilmington, the kind of life he wanted to live, the only life he knew how to live. Boston was nice to visit, but it wasn't home. He'd never even contemplated living somewhere else. And then there was his father-he was getting up in years, and despite the strong exterior, his age was catching up with him and Garrett was all he had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other hand, Theresa had strong ties to Boston. Though her parents lived elsewhere, Kevin was in a school he liked, she had a blossoming career with a major newspaper, and she had a network of friends she'd have to leave. She'd worked hard to get where she was, and if she left Boston, she'd probably have to give it up. Would she be able to do that without resenting him for what he'd made her do?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Deep down, however, he knew it wasn't going to be that easy, and not just because of the distance between them. After he'd returned from his second trip to Boston, he had a picture of Theresa enlarged and framed. He set it on the bedstand opposite Catherine's picture, but despite his feelings for Theresa, it seemed out of place in his bedroom. A few days later he moved the picture across the room, but it still didn't help. Wherever he put it, it seemed to him as if Catherine's eyes would follow it. This is ridiculous, he told himself after moving it yet again. Nonetheless he found himself finally slipping Theresa's picture into the drawer and reaching for Catherine's instead. Sighing, he sat on the bed and held it in front of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett didn't want to think about it. Instead he focused on the fact that he loved Theresa, clinging to the belief that if they were meant to be together, they would find a way to do it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day before her arrival, Garrett helped his father finish his preparations. Garrett mowed the lawn while Jeb unpacked the wedding china he seldom, if ever, used anymore and washed the dishes by hand. After searching for matching silverware-easier said than done-Jeb found a tablecloth in the closet, deciding it would be a nice touch. He tossed it into the washing machine just as Garrett came inside after finishing the yard. Garrett walked to the cupboard and pulled a glass from the shelf.</div>

Though Theresa had left a message for him with her hotel information in Dallas, he hadn't called last night, telling himself that it was too late and that she was already asleep. It was a lie and he knew it, but he simply didn't feel like talking to her yet.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">The fact was, he didn't feel like talking to anyone. He was still angry at what she'd done, and the best place for him to think about it was out on the ocean, where no one could bother him. Most of the morning he found himself wondering if she realized how much this whole thing bothered him. More than likely she didn't-he convinced himself-otherwise she wouldn't have done it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That is, if she cared about him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though he wasn't happy about it, he wondered if all relationships had moments like these. If truth be told, he didn't know. The only other real relationship he'd ever had was with Catherine, and it wasn't easy to compare the two. He and Catherine were married and living under the same roof, for one thing. Even more, they'd known each other most of their lives, and because they were younger, they didn't have the same responsibilities that either Garrett or Theresa had now. They were fresh out of college, they didn't own a home, and there certainly weren't any children to care for. No-what they had was completely different from what he and Theresa had now, and it wasn't fair to try to link them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time the sun rose higher in the sky, however, his anger began to fade. As he thought more clearly about the situation, he decided that his father had been right-as usual. Her reason for not coming didn't reflect on him as much as it reflected on the differences in their lives. She did have responsibilities she couldn't ignore, and as long as they continued to live separate lives, things like this were going to keep coming up.</div>

<div class="line_en">But one thing he did know-he hadn't ever analyzed his relationship with Catherine the way he was doing with Theresa, and this wasn't fair, either. Besides, analysis wasn't going to help him in this situation. All the analysis in the world didn't change the fact that they didn't see each other as much as they wanted-or needed-to.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa stopped at the window of a small craft store and asked if Garrett wanted to go inside. Shaking his head, he said, "You go ahead. I'll wait for you here."

<div class="line_en">He started walking again, slowly. Again he heard the laughter-childlike, happy. He stopped in his tracks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Something darted into the fog, and he moved quickly toward it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where are you?" he shouted, even louder this time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rain began to fall harder now, and suddenly everything seemed to be moving in slow motion. He began to jog… slowly… slowly… he could see her just ahead… the fog growing thicker by the second… rain coming down in showers… a glimpse of her hair…</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you love her?" Jeb asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wiped the rain from his face. "Catherine?… Is it really you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've done a lot of thinking since then."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's me, Garrett."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think I want to marry her, Dad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jeb Blake shook his head. "No… you haven't," he said sincerely. "We've talked about her a lot-you've told me that she makes you happy, that you feel like you know her, and that you don't want to lose her-but you've never told me that you love her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You must have," Jeb said quietly. He reeled in his line, checked the bait, then cast again. Even though he doubted he'd catch anything he wanted to keep, fishing was, in his estimation, one of life's greatest pleasures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Two days ago, it didn't seem like you wanted to see her again."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it wasn't her voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett looked at him, surprised. "Of course I do. I've told you that a few times."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were fishing together at the end of the pier with a dozen other people, most of whom seemed lost in thought. Jeb looked up in surprise.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">it for the right reasons. Two days ago, you weren't even sure if you wanted to see her again. Now, you're ready for marriage. It just seems like a mighty big turnaround to me, and I want to make sure it's because of the way you feel about Theresa-and that it doesn't have anything to do with Catherine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jeb stared at his son for a moment before finally turning away. "You want to marry her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Catherine doesn't have anything to do with this," Garrett said quickly. He shook his head and sighed deeply. "You know, Dad, I don't understand you sometimes. You've been pushing me into this the whole time. You kept telling me I had to put the past behind me, that I had to find someone new. And now that I have, it seems like you're trying to talk me out of it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jeb put his free hand on Garrett's shoulder. "I'm not talking you out of anything, Garrett. I'm glad you found Theresa, I'm glad that you love her, and yes, I do hope that you end up marrying her. I just said that if you're going to get married, then you'd better be doing it for the right reasons. Marriage is between two people, not three. And it's not fair to her if you go into it otherwise."</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa had called him more than usual in the preceding two weeks. Usually it had been Garrett who called, but it seemed that every time he'd wanted to talk to her, she had anticipated it. Twice, while he was walking to the phone to dial her number, it started ringing before he got there, and the second time it happened, he simply answered the phone with, "Hi, Theresa." It had surprised her, and they joked for a while about his psychic abilities before settling into an easy conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he arrived in Boston two weeks later, Theresa met him at the airport. She had told him to wear something dressy, and he walked off the plane wearing a blazer, something she'd never seen him in before.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wow," she'd said simply.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went straight from the airport to dinner. She'd made reservations at the most elegant restaurant in town. They had a leisurely, wonderful meal, and afterward Theresa took Garrett to Les Miserables, which was currently showing in Boston. The play was sold out, but because Theresa knew the manager, they found themselves seated in the best section of the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was late by the time they got back, and to Garrett, the following day seemed just as rushed. Theresa took him to her office and showed him around-introducing him to a couple of people-and afterward they visited the Museum of Fine Arts for the rest of the afternoon. That evening they met Deanna and Brian for dinner at Anthony's-a restaurant on the top floor of the Prudential Building that offered wonderful views of the entire city.</div>
