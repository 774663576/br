<div class="line_en">You have probably heard of Thor and his hammer. Before Christianity came to Norway, people believed that Thor rode across the sky in a chariot drawn by two goats. When he swung his hammer it made thunder and lightning. The word "thunder" in Norwegian -- "Thor-don" -- means Thor's roar. In Swedish, the word for thunder is "aska," originally "as-aka," which means "god's journey" over the heavens.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thor was a central figure in this battle with the giants. His hammer could do more than make rain; it was a key weapon in the struggle against the dangerous forces of chaos.

The offering to Thor was usually a goat. Offerings to Odin sometimes took the form of human sacrifices.</div>

<div class="line_en">The myth that is best known in the Nordic countries comes from the Eddie poem "The Lay of Thrym." It tells how Thor, rising from sleep, finds that his hammer is gone. This makes him so angry that his hands tremble and his beard shakes. Accompanied by his henchman Loki he goes to Freyja to ask if Loki may borrow her wings so that he can fly to Jotunheim, the land of the giants, and find out if they are the ones who have stolen Thor's hammer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="北欧国家最著名的神话来自冰岛一首名为《史莱慕之诗》（The Lay of Thrym）的诗。诗中叙述有一天索尔醒来，发现他的锤子不见了，气得双手发抖，吹胡子瞪眼睛。于是他带着侍僮洛奇去拜访芙瑞雅，问她是否可以将翅膀借他，好让洛奇可以飞到巨人所住的“约腾海”（Jotunheim），以查探那些巨人是否偷了索尔的锤子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Jotunheim Loki meets Thrym, the king of the giants, who sure enough begins to boast that he has hidden the hammer seven leagues under the earth. And he adds that the gods will not get the hammer back until Thrym is given Freyja as his bride.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛奇到了约腾海后，见到了巨人之王史莱慕。后者得意地宣称他已将锤子藏在地下七里格的地方，并说除非诸神将芙瑞雅嫁给他，否则他不会归还锤子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Can you picture it, Sophie? Suddenly the good gods find themselves in the midst of a full-blown hostage incident. The giants have seized the gods' most vital defensive weapon. This is an utterly unacceptable situation. As long as the giants have Thor's hammer, they have total control over the world of gods and mortals. In exchange for the hammer they are demanding Freyja. But this is equally unacceptable. If the gods have to give up their goddess of fertility -- she who protects all life -- the grass will disappear from the fields and all gods and mortals will die. The situation is deadlocked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲，你了解吗？这些善良的神明突然间面临了一个全面的人质危机。巨人们夺走了诸神最有力的防卫武器，这是令人完全无法忍受的情况。只要巨人们拥有索尔的锤子，他们便能够百分之百控制诸神与凡人的世界。他们要求用芙瑞雅来交换锤子的行为也令人无法接受。如果诸神被迫放弃芙瑞雅这位保护天下生灵的丰饶女神，则田野上将看不到绿草，所有的神明与凡人也都将死去。这真是令人左右为难的困境。假如你能想象一群恐怖分子扬言要在伦敦或巴黎的市中心引爆一枚核子炸弹，除非他们达到他们所提的可怕要求，你马上就可以了解这个情况的严重性了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the gods arrive at Jotunheim, the giants begin to prepare the wedding feast. But during the feast, the bride -- Thor, that is -- devours an entire ox and eight salmon. He also drinks three barrels of beer. This astonishes Thrym. The true identity of the "commandos" is very nearly revealed.

<div class="line_en">But a myth was not only an explanation. People also carried out religious ceremonies related to the myths.

But one morning the brave Prince Bravato came and rescued her. Sikita was so happy that she began to dance over the meadows, singing a song she had composed inside the dank prison.
