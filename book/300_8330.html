<div class="line_en">The grass-plot before the jail, in Prison Lane, on a certain summer morning, not less than two centuries ago, was occupied by a pretty large number of the inhabitants of Boston; all with their eyes intently fastened on the iron-clamped oaken door. Amongst any other population, or at a later period in the history of New England, the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would have augured some awful business in hand. It could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit, on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment. But, in that early severity of the Puritan character, an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn. It might be, that a sluggish bond-servant, or an undutiful child, whom his parents had given over to the civil authority, was to be corrected at the whipping-post. It might be, that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist, was to be scourged out of the town, or an idle and vagrant Indian, whom the white man's fire-water had made riotous about the streets, was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest. It might be, too, that a witch, like old Mistress Hibbins, the bitter-tempered widow of the magistrate, was to die upon the gallows. In either case, there was very much the same solemnity of demeanour on the part of the spectators; as befitted a people amongst whom religion and law were almost identical, and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused, that the mildest and the severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful. Meagre, indeed, and cold, was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for, from such bystanders, at the scaffold. On the other hand, a penalty which, in our days, would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule, might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a circumstance to be noted, on the summer morning when our story begins its course, that the women, of whom there were several in the crowd, appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue. The age had not so much refinement, that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways, and wedging their not unsubstantial persons, if occasion were, into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution. Morally, as well as materially, there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old English birth and breeding, than in their fair descendants, separated from them by a series of six or seven generations; for, throughout that chain of ancestry, every successive mother has transmitted to her child a fainter bloom, a more delicate and briefer beauty, and a slighter physical frame, if not a character of less force and solidity, than her own. The women who were now standing about the prison-door stood within less than half a century of the period when the man-like Elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex. They were her country-women; and the beef and ale of their native land, with a moral diet not a whit more refined, entered largely into their composition. The bright morning sun, therefore, shone on broad shoulders and well-developed busts, and on round and ruddy cheeks, that had ripened in the far-off island, and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of New England. There was, moreover, a boldness and rotundity of speech among these matrons, as most of them seemed to be, that would startle us at the present day, whether in respect to its purport or its volume of tone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在我们的故事发生的那个夏天的早晨，有一情况颇值一书：挤在人群中的好几位妇女，看来劝可能出现的任何刑罚那抱有特殊的兴趣。那年月没有那么多文明讲究，身着衬裙和撑裙的女人们公然出入于大庭广众之中，只要有可能，便要撅动姻们那并不娇弱的躯体，挤进最靠近刑台的人群中去，也不会缎入什么不成体统的感觉。那些在英伦故土上出生和成长的媳妇和姑娘们，比起她们六七代之后的漂亮的后裔来，身体要粗壮些，精神也要粗犷些；因为通过家系承袭的链条，每代母亲遗传给她女儿的，即使不是较她为少的坚实有力的性格，总会是比较柔弱的体质、更加娇小和短暂的美貌和更加纤细的身材。当时在牢门附近站着的妇女们，和那位堪称代表女性的男子气概的伊丽莎白相距不足半个世纪。她们是那位女王的乡亲：她们家多的牛肉和麦酒，佐以未经提炼的精神食粮，大量充实进她们的躯体。因此，明亮的晨感所照射着的，是宽阔的肩膀、发育丰满的胸脯和又圆又红的双颊——她们都是在通远的祖国本岛上长大成人的，远还没有在新英格兰的气氛中变得白皙与瘦削些。尤其令人瞩目的是，这些主妇们多数人一开口便是粗喉咙、大嗓门，要是在今天，她们的言谈无论是含义还是音量，都足以使我们瞠目结舌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mercy on us, goodwife," exclaimed a man in the crowd, "is there no virtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows? That is the hardest word yet! Hush, now, gossips! for the lock is turning in the prison-door, and here comes Mistress Prynne herself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪，婆娘们，”人群中一个男人惊呼道，“女人看到绞刑架就害怕，除去这种廉耻之心，她们身上难道就没有德性了吗？别把话说得太重了！轻点，喂，婆娘们！牢门的锁在转呢，海丝特太太本人就要出来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the young woman -- the mother of this child -- stood fully revealed before the crowd, it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom; not so much by an impulse of motherly affection, as that she might thereby conceal a certain token, which was wrought or fastened into her dress. In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and, with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her townspeople and neighbours. On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendour in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony.</div>

<div class="line_en">The young woman was tall, with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale. She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes. She was ladylike, too, after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days; characterised by a certain state and dignity, rather than by the delicate, evanescent, and indescribable grace, which is now recognised as its indication. And never had Hester Prynne appeared more ladylike, in the antique interpretation of the term, than as she issued from the prison. Those who had before known her, and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud, were astonished, and even startled, to perceive how her beauty shone out, and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped. It may be true, that, to a sensitive observer, there was something exquisitely painful in it. Her attire, which, indeed, she had wrought for the occasion, in prison, and had modelled much after her own fancy, seemed to express the attitude of her spirit, the desperate recklessness of her mood, by its wild and picturesque peculiarity. But the point which drew all eyes, and, as it were, transfigured the wearer -- so that both men and women, who had been familiarly acquainted with Hester Prynne, were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first time -- was that SCARLET LETTER, so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom. It had the effect of a spell, taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity, and enclosing her in a sphere by herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年轻妇女身材颀长，体态优美之极。她头上乌黑的浓发光彩夺目，在阳光下说说熠熠生辉。她的面孔不仅皮肤滋润、五官端正、容貌秀丽，而且还有一对鲜明的眉毛和一双漆黑的深目，十分楚楚动人。就那个时代女性举止优雅的风范而论，她也属贵妇之列；她自有一种端庄的风韵，并不同子如今人们心目中的那种纤巧、轻盈和不可言喻的优雅。即使以当年的概念而吉，海丝特·白兰也从来没有象步出监狱的此时此刻这样更象贵妇。那些本来就认识她的人，原先满以为她经历过这一魔难，会缀然失色，结果却惊得都发呆了，因为他们所看到的，是她焕发的美丽，竟把笼罩着她的不幸和耻辱凝成一轮光环。不过，目光敏锐的旁观者无疑能从中觉察出一种微妙的痛楚。她在狱中按照自己的想象，专门为这场合制作的服饰，以其特有的任性和别致，似乎表达了她的精神境界和由绝望而无所顾忌的心情。但是，吸引了所有的人的目光而且事实上使海丝特·白兰焕然一新的，则是在她胸前额频闪光的绣得妙不可言的那个红字，以致那些与她熟识的男男女女简直感到是第一次与她谋面。这个红字具有一种震慑的力量，竟然把她从普通的人间关系中超脱出来，紧裹在自身的氛围里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators. Preceded by the beadle, and attended by an irregular procession of stern-browed men and unkindly-visaged women, Hester Prynne set forth towards the place appointed for her punishment. A crowd of eager and curious schoolboys, understanding little of the matter in hand, except that it gave them a half-holiday, ran before her progress, turning their heads continually to stare into her face, and at the winking baby in her arms, and at the ignominious letter on her breast. It was no great distance, in those days, from the prison-door to the market-place. Measured by the prisoner's experience, however, it might be reckoned a journey of some length; for, haughty as her demeanour was, she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her, as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon. In our nature, however, there is a provision alike marvellous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it. With almost a serene deportment, therefore, Hester Prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal, and came to a sort of scaffold, at the western extremity of the market-place. It stood nearly beneath the eaves of Boston's earliest church, and appeared to be a fixture there.</div>

<div class="line_en">The scene was not without a mixture of awe, such as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellow-creature, before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile, instead of shuddering, at it. The witnesses of Hester Prynne's disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity. They were stern enough to look upon her death, had that been the sentence, without a murmur at its severity, but had none of the heartlessness of another social state, which would find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present. Even if there had been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule, it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the Governor, and several of his counsellors, a judge, a general, and the ministers of the town; all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meetinghouse, looking down upon the platform. When such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle, without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and office, it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning. Accordingly, the crowd was sombre and grave. The unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might, under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes, all fastened upon her and concentrated at her bosom. It was almost intolerable to be borne. Of an impulsive and passionate nature, she had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs of public contumely, wreaking itself in every variety of insult; but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind, that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment, and herself the object. Had a roar of laughter burst from the multitude -- each man, each woman, each little shrill-voiced child, contributing their individual parts -- Hester Prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile. But, under the leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure, she felt, at moments, as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs, and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground, or else go mad at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在人类社会尚未腐败到极点之前，目睹这种罪恶与羞辱的场面，人们还不致以淡然一笑代替不寒而栗，总会给留下一种敬畏心理。亲眼看到海丝特·白兰示众的人们尚未失去他们的纯真。如果她被判死刑，他们会冷冷地看着她死去，而不会咕哝一句什么过于严苛；但他们谁也不会象另一种社会形态中的人那样，把眼前的这种示众只当作笑柄。即使有人心里觉得这事有点可笑，也会因为几位至尊至贵的大人物的郑重出席，而吓得不敢放肆。总督、他的几位参议、一名法官、一名将军和镇上的牧师们就在议事厅的阳台上或坐或立，俯视着刑台。能有这样一些人物到场，而不失他们地位的显赫和职务的威严，我们可以有把握地推断，所做的法律判决肯定具有真挚而有效的含义。因之，人群也显出相应的阴郁和庄重。这个不幸的罪人，在数百双无情的日光紧盯着她、集中在她前胸的重压之下，尽一个妇人的最大可能支撑着自己。这实在是难以忍受的。她本是一个充满热情、容易冲动的人，此时她已使自己坚强起来，以面对用形形色色的侮辱来发泄的公愤的毒刺和利刃；但是，人们那种庄重的情绪反倒隐含着一种可做得多的气氛，使她宁可看到那一张张僵刻的面孔露出轻蔑的嬉笑来嘲弄她。如果从构成这一群人中的每一个男人、每一个女人和每一个尖嗓门的孩子的口中爆发出轰笑，海丝特·白兰或许可以对他们所有的人报以倔傲的冷笑。可是，在她注定要忍受的这种沉闷的打击之下，她时时感到要鼓尼胸腔中的全部力量来尖声呼号，并从刑台上翻到地面，否则，她会立刻发疯的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Had there been a papist among the crowd of Puritans, he might have seen in this beautiful woman, so picturesque in her attire and mien, and with the infant at her bosom, an object to remind him of the image of Divine Maternity, which so many illustrious painters have vied with one another to represent; something which should remind him, indeed, but only by contrast, of that sacred image of sinless motherhood, whose infant was to redeem the world. Here, there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life, working such effect, that the world was only the darker for this woman's beauty, and the more lost for the infant that she had borne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="设若在这一群清教徒之中有一个罗马天主教徒的话，他就会从这个服饰和神采如画、怀中紧抱婴儿的美妇身上，联想起众多杰出画家所竞先描绘的圣母的形象，诚然，他的这种联想只能在对比中才能产生，因为圣像中那圣洁清白的母性怀中的婴儿是献给世人来赎罪的。然而在她身上，世俗生活中最神圣的品德，却被最深重的罪孽所玷污了，其结果，只能使世界由于这妇人的美丽而更加晦默，由于她生下的婴儿而益发沉沦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Be that as it might, the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view that revealed to Hester Prynne the entire track along which she had been treading, since her happy infancy. Standing on that miserable eminence, she saw her native village, in old England, and her paternal home; a decayed house of grey stone, with a poverty-stricken aspect, but retaining a half-obliterated shield of arms over the portal, in token of antique gentility. She saw her father's face, with its bald brow, and reverend white beard, that flowed over the old-fashioned Elizabethan ruff; her mother's, too, with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance, and which, even since her death, had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughter's pathway. She saw her own face, glowing with girlish beauty, and illuminating all the interior of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it. There she beheld another countenance, of a man well stricken in years, a pale, thin, scholar-like visage, with eyes dim and bleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books. Yet those same bleared optics had a strange, penetrating power, when it was their owner's purpose to read the human soul. This figure of the study and the cloister, as Hester Prynne's womanly fancy failed not to recall, was slightly deformed, with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right. Next rose before her, in memory's picture-gallery, the intricate and narrow thoroughfares, the tall grey houses, the huge cathedrals, and the public edifices, ancient in date and quaint in architecture, of a Continental city; where a new life had awaited her, still in connection with the misshapen scholar; a new life, but feeding itself on time-worn materials, like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall. Lastly, in lieu of these shifting scenes, came back the rude market-place of the Puritan settlement, with all the townspeople assembled and levelling their stern regards at Hester Prynne -- yes, at herself -- who stood on the scaffold of the pillory, an infant on her arm, and the letter A, in scarlet, fantastically embroidered with gold thread, upon her bosom!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论如何，这座示众刑台成了一个了望点，在海丝特·白兰面前展现山自从她幸福的童年以来的全都轨迹。她痛苦地高高站在那里，再次看见了她在老英格兰故乡的村落和她父母的家园：那是一座破败的灰色石屋，虽说外表是一派衰微的景象，但在门廊上方还残存着半明半暗的盾形家族纹章，标志着远祖的世系。她看到厂她父亲的面容：光秃秃的额头和飘洒在伊丽莎白时代老式环状皱领上的威风凛凛的白须；她也看到了她母亲的面容，那种无微不至和牵肠挂肚的爱的表情，时时在她脑海中索绕，即使在母亲去世之后，仍在女儿的人生道路上经常留下温馨忆念的告诫。她看到了自己少女时代的光彩动人的美貌，把她惯于映照的那面昏暗的镜子的整个镜心都照亮了。她还看到了另一副面孔，那是一个年老力衰的男人的面孔，苍白而瘦削，看上去一副学者模样，由于在灯光下研读一册册长篇巨著而老眼昏花。然而正是这同一双昏花的烂眼，在一心接窥测他人的灵魂时，又具有那么奇特的洞察力。尽管海丝特·白兰那女性的想象力竭力想摆脱他的形象，但那学者和隐士的身影还是出现了：他略带畸形，左肩比右肩稍高。在她回忆的画廊中接卜来升到她眼前的，是欧洲大陆一座城市里的纵横交错又显得狭窄的街道，以及年深日久、古色古香的公共建筑物，宏伟的天主教堂和高大的灰色住宅；一种崭新的生活在那里等待着她，不过仍和那个陶形的学者密切相关；那种生活象是附在颓垣上的一簇青苔，只能靠腐败的营养滋补自己。最终，这些接踵而至的场景烟消云散，海丝特·白兰又回到这片清教徒殖民地的简陋的市场上，全镇的人都聚集在这里，一双双严厉的眼睛紧紧盯着她——是的，盯着她本人——她站在示众刑台上，怀中抱着婴儿，胸前钉着那个用金丝线绝妙地绣着花边的鲜红的字母A！">查看中文翻译</div>

She clutched the child so fiercely to her breast, that it sent forth a cry; she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter, and even touched it with her finger, to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real. Yes! -- these were her realities -- all else had vanished!</div>
