<div class="line_en">As soon as lofur announced that lorek Byrnison was on his way, and a combat would take place, the combat ground was swept and smoothed, and armorers came up from the fire mines to check lofur's armor. Every rivet was examined, every link tested, and the plates were burnished with the finest sand. Just as much attention was paid to his claws. The gold leaf was rubbed off, and each separate six-inch hook was sharpened and filed to a deadly point. Lyra watched with a growing sickness in the pit of her stomach, for lorek Byrnison wouldn't be having this attention; he had been marching over the ice for nearly twenty-four hours already without rest or food; he might have been injured in the crash. And she had let him in for this fight without his knowledge. At one point, after lofur Raknison had tested the sharpness of his claws on a fresh-killed walrus, slicing its skin open like paper, and the power of his crashing blows on the walrus's skull (two blows, and it was cracked like an egg), Lyra had to make an excuse to lofur and go away by herself to weep with fear.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fights between bears were common, and the subject of much ritual. For a bear to kill another was rare, though, and when that happened it was usually by accident, or when one bear mistook the signals from another, as in the case of lorek Byrnison. Cases of straightforward murder, like lofur's killing of his own father, were rarer still.</div>

<div class="line_en">By this time, word had spread among the bears, and every part of the combat ground was crowded. Bears of high rank had the best places, and there was a special enclosure for the she-bears, including, of course, lofur's wives. Lyra was profoundly curious about she-bears, because she knew so little about them, but this was no time to wander about asking questions. Instead she stayed close to lofur Raknison and watched the courtiers around him assert their rank over the common bears from outside, and tried to guess the meaning of the various plumes and badges and tokens they all seemed to wear. Some of the highest-ranking, she saw, carried little manikins like lofur's rag-doll daemon, trying to curry favor, perhaps, by imitating the fashion he'd begun. She was sardonically pleased to notice that when they saw that lofur had discarded his, they didn't know what to do with theirs. Should they throw them away? Were they out of favor now? How should they behave?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，这件事已经在披甲熊中间传开了，战场上到处挤满了熊。级别高的熊占据了最好的位置，还专门给母熊划出了一块地方，其中当然也包括埃欧弗尔的妻子。莱拉对母熊有着深深的好奇，因为她对她们知道得太少了，但现在可不是四处闲逛问问题的时候。相反，她跟埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松离得很近，看着他周围的侍臣在外围显示自己的职位比普通的熊要高，试着去猜他们似乎全都戴着的各式各样的羽毛、徽章和标志的含义。她发现，在最高级别的熊当中，有的还拿着个小小的人体模型，就像埃欧弗尔的碎布娃娃似的——通过模仿由他开始的时尚，他们也许是为了尽量拍他的马屁。让她觉得可笑的是，当他们看见埃欧弗尔已经把自己的娃娃扔掉之后，他们不知道该怎么对待自己的那些娃娃了。该把它们扔掉？他们现在是不是失宠了？他们该怎么表现？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even Pantalaimon, who could normally cheer her up, had little to say that was hopeful. All she could do was consult the alethiometer: he is an hour away, it told her, and again, she must trust him; and (this was harder to read) she even thought it was rebuking her for asking the same question twice.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fog had lifted by this time, and the air was clear; and as chance would have it, the brief lifting of darkness toward noon coincided with the time Lyra thought lorek was going to arrive. As she stood shivering on a little rise of dense-packed snow at the edge of the combat ground, she looked up toward the faint lightness in the sky, and longed with all her heart to see a flight of ragged elegant black shapes descending to bear her away; or to see the Aurora's hidden city, where she would be able to walk safely along those broad boulevards in the sunlight; or to see Ma Costa's broad arms, to smell the friendly smells of flesh and cooking that enfolded you in her presence…</div>

<div class="line_en">She found herself crying, with tears that froze almost as soon as they formed, and which she had to brush away painfully. She was so frightened. Bears, who didn't cry, couldn't understand what was happening to her; it was some human process, meaningless. And of course Pantalaimon couldn't comfort her as he normally would, though she kept her hand in her pocket firmly around his warm little mouse-form, and he nuzzled at her fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她发觉自己哭了，眼泪几乎一流出来就被冻住了，她只好忍着痛把它们擦掉。她是那么地害怕。熊是不会哭的，他们不明白她这是怎么了，大概是人类的一种本能，没有任何意义。莱拉的手还放在口袋里，紧紧地握着潘特莱蒙的老鼠身子，可是他却无法像通常那样来安慰她，只是用鼻子轻轻地蹭她的手指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beside her, the smiths were making the final adjustments to lofur Raknison's armor. He reared like a great metal tower, shining in polished steel, the smooth plates inlaid with wires of gold; his helmet enclosed the upper part of his head in a glistening carapace of silver-gray, with deep eye slits; and the underside of his body was protected by a close-fitting sark of chain mail. It was when she saw this that Lyra realized that she had betrayed lorek Byrnison, for lorek had nothing like it. His armor protected only his back and sides. She looked at lofur Raknison, so sleek and powerful, and felt a deep sickness in her, like guilt and fear combined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在莱拉身边，铁匠们在对埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松的盔甲进行最后的调整。他站在那儿，像一座巨大的铁塔似的，身上的铁甲熠熠闪光，光滑的金属片上镶嵌着金线；他上半截脑袋包在闪着银灰色光芒的头盔里，上面的眼睛处留了两道很深的缝隙，下半身穿着一件贴身的锁子甲。直到看见这一切，莱拉才意识到自己已经背叛了埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松，因为这些东西埃欧雷克一样也没有，他的甲胄只能保护后背和身体两侧。再看看埃欧弗尔·拉克尼松，他穿得那么整齐，又是那么强壮。就像愧疚和恐惧一起袭来似的，莱拉觉得心里一阵恶心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then with a roar and a blur of snow both bears moved at the same moment. Like two great masses of rock balanced on adjoining peaks and shaken loose by an earthquake, which bound down the mountainsides gathering speed, leaping over crevasses and knocking trees into splinters, until they crash into each other so hard that both are smashed to powder and flying chips of stone: that was how the two bears came together. The crash as they met resounded in the still air and echoed back from the palace wall. But they weren't destroyed, as rock would have been. They both fell aside, and the first to rise was lorek. He twisted up in a lithe spring and grappled with lofur, whose armor had been damaged by the collision and who couldn't easily raise his head. lorek made at once for the vulnerable gap at his neck. He raked the white fur, and then hooked his claws beneath the edge of lofur's helmet and wrenched it forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，随着一声咆哮，两只熊同时向前猛扑过去，卷起的雪花迷住人的眼睛。他们像两块原本稳放在两座毗邻山峰上的巨石，被地震松动了似的，一下子从山腰上翻滚下来，愈来愈快，跃过山涧，撞碎树木，终于——“砰”地一声，重重地迎头相撞，撞得碎石纷飞：两只熊就是这样撞到了一起。巨大的撞击声在沉寂的空气中回荡着，又从宫殿的墙上反弹回来。即使是岩石，这一撞也会被撞毁，但他们俩却没有。他们全都摔倒在一边。第一个站起来的是埃欧雷克。他身子一拧，敏捷地一跃而起，去抓埃欧弗尔。埃欧弗尔的盔甲被撞坏了，很难抬起头来。埃欧雷克立刻伸手去抓他脖子上露出来的那段没有防护的部分，把那儿的白毛略一摸索，爪子随即扣住埃欧弗尔的头盔下边，猛力往前一扳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra felt her own breath knocked out of her by the force of that crashing fall. Certainly the very ground shook beneath her. How could lorek survive that? He was struggling to twist himself and gain a purchase on the ground, but his feet were uppermost, and lofur had fixed his teeth somewhere near lorek's throat. Drops of hot blood were flying through the air: one landed on Lyra's furs, and she pressed her hand to it like a token of love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉觉得这毁灭性的一扑简直把自己的魂儿都要撞飞了，脚下的大地被实实在在地震得直晃。埃欧雷克怎么能受得了？他费力地扭动着身躯，想在地上找到支撑点站起来，但他的脚却冲着天。这时，埃欧弗尔的牙齿已经咬住了埃欧雷克喉咙附近的某个地方，滚烫的血珠在空中飞溅开来。有一滴落在莱拉的皮衣上，她马上用手把它按住，以表示自己是爱埃欧雷克的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sensing the danger, lofur snarled and shook himself as Lyra had seen lorek shake himself at the water's edge, sending sheets of water flying high into the air. And lorek fell away, dislodged, and with a screech of twisting metal lofur stood up tall, straightening the steel of his back plates by sheer strength. Then like an avalanche he hurled himself down on lorek, who was still trying to rise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃欧弗尔立刻意识到了这一危险，他怒吼一声，身子猛地一晃——莱拉曾经看见埃欧雷克自己在水边就是这样一晃，把身上的水高高地甩向空中。他这一甩，把埃欧雷克甩到了一边，摆脱了他的进攻。随即，在被扭曲了的金属的尖啸声中，埃欧弗尔奋力一挣，把后背上的金属板拉直了。然后，趁埃欧雷克挣扎着要站起来的当儿，埃欧弗尔如同一座崩落的雪山，向埃欧雷克猛扑下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then lorek's rear claws dug into the links of lofur's chain-mail sark and ripped downward. The whole front came away, and lofur lurched sideways to look at the damage, leaving lorek to scramble upright again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra watched, hardly daring to breathe, and squeezing her hands together so tight it hurt. She thought she saw lofur tearing at a wound in lorek's belly, but that couldn't be right, because a moment later, after another convulsive explosion of snow, both bears were standing upright like boxers, and lorek was slashing with mighty claws at lofur's face, with lofur hitting back just as savagely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉目不转睛地看着，大气都不敢喘一口，两只手紧紧攥在一起，攥得手都疼了起来。她觉得自己看到了埃欧弗尔正在撕扯埃欧雷克肚子上的一个伤口——不过也许是她看错了，因为过了一会儿，在阵阵雪花激烈地飞溅之后，两只熊都像拳击手似地站直了身子，埃欧雷克用巨掌猛击埃欧弗尔的脸，埃欧弗尔也同样凶猛地予以回击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment the two bears stood apart, getting their breath back. lofur was hampered now by that chain mail, because from a protection it had changed all at once into a hindrance: it was still fastened at the bottom, and trailed around his rear legs. However, lorek was worse off. He was bleeding freely from a wound at his neck, and panting heavily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一会儿，两只熊各自站在一边，大口大口地喘着气。埃欧弗尔的那副锁子成了他的累赘，原本起防护作用的它这时已经变成了障碍：锁子甲的下面依然连在一起，缠在两条后腿上。然而，埃欧雷克的情况更糟，他呼哧呼哧地喘着粗气，脖子上的一个伤口正汩汩地冒着鲜血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he leaped at lofur before the king could disentangle himself from the clinging chain mail, and knocked him head over heels, following up with a lunge at the bare part of lofur's neck, where the edge of the helmet was bent. lofur threw him off, and then the two bears were at each other again, throwing up fountains of snow that sprayed in all directions and sometimes made it hard to see who had the advantage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，没等埃欧弗尔把贴身的锁子甲摆脱掉，埃欧雷克便纵身一跃。向他扑过去，一拳把他打倒在地，随即猛戳埃欧弗尔脖子上因为头盔卷边而裸露在外面的部位。埃欧弗尔用力把他摔了出去，然后两只熊又纠缠在一起。积雪四处飞溅，让人有时很难看清谁占了上风。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">lofur's armor was in a pitiful state by this time, the plates torn and distorted, the gold inlay torn out or smeared thickly with blood, and his helmet gone altogether. lorek's was in much better condition, for all its ugliness: dented, but intact, standing up far better to the great sledgehammer blows of the bear-king, and turning aside those brutal six-inch claws.</div>

He began to taunt lorek, calling him broken-hand, whimpering cub, rust-eaten, soon-to-die, and other names, all the while swinging blows at him from right and left which lorek could no longer parry. lorek had to move backward, a step at a time, and to crouch low under the rain of blows from the jeering bear-king.</div>
