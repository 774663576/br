<div class="line_en">A. G. Geiger's place was a store frontage on the north side of the boulevard near Las Palmas. The entrance door was set far back in the middle and there was a copper trim on the windows, which were backed with Chinese screens, so I couldn't see into the store. There was a lot of oriental junk in the windows. I didn't know whether it was any good, not being a collector of antiques, except unpaid bills. The entrance door was plate glass, but I couldn't see much through that either, because the store was very dim. A building entrance adjoined it on one side and on the other was a glittering credit jewelry establishment. The jeweler stood in his entrance, teetering on his heels and looking bored, a tall handsome white-haired Jew in lean dark clothes, with about nine carats of diamond on his right hand. A faint knowing smile curved his lips when I turned into Geiger's store. I let the door close softly behind me and walked on a thick blue rug that paved the floor from wall to wall. There were blue leather easy chairs with smoke stands beside them. A few sets of tooled leather bindings were set out on narrow polished tables, between book ends. There were more tooled bindings in glass cases on the walls. Nice-looking merchandise, the kind a rich promoter would buy by the yard and have somebody paste his bookplate in. At the back there was a grained wood partition with a door in the middle of it, shut. In the corner made by the partition and one wall a woman sat behind a small desk with a carved wooden lantern on it.</div>

<div class="line_en">She got up slowly and swayed towards me in a tight black dress that didn't reflect any light. She had long thighs and she walked with a certain something I hadn't often seen in bookstores. She was an ash blonde with greenish eyes, beaded lashes, hair waved smoothly back from ears in which large jet buttons glittered. Her fingernails were silvered. In spite of her get-up she looked as if she would have a hall bedroom accent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她缓缓起身，婀娜地向我走来，紧致的黑套裙泛不出一丝光亮。她大腿很长，步态里透着某种在书店里难得一见的东西。她灰金色头发，淡绿眼睛，睫毛上点缀着小珠子，波浪发丝柔顺地披在耳后，乌黑硕大的纽扣耳环闪闪发光。她的指甲涂成了银色。即便穿戴光鲜，她还是会带给你这样的印象：此人一开口八成是穷酸腔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She approached me with enough sex appeal to stampede a businessmen's lunch and tilted her head to finger a stray, but not very stray, tendril of softly glowing hair. Her smile was tentative, but could be persuaded to be nice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走近我身旁，性感得能搅乱一场生意人的饭局；她把头一歪，拨弄着一绺有点散乱却又不太散乱的柔亮鬈发。她的笑容迟疑不决，但加以争取，便能转为甜美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她打量了我一番。笑容不见了。眼神略带敌意。站姿非常笔挺僵硬。她朝那几面罩了玻璃的书架挥了挥银指甲。“你看里面的东西——难道像葡萄柚吗？”她挖苦道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Silence for about five minutes. The door opened and a tall hungry-looking bird with a cane and a big nose came in neatly, shut the door behind him against the pressure of the door closer, marched over to the corner and placed a wrapped parcel on the desk. He took a pinseal wallet with gold corners from his pocket and showed the blonde something. She pressed a button on the desk. The tall bird went to the door in the paneled partition and opened it barely enough to slip through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约五分钟的沉默。门开了，来了个满脸饥渴的高个家伙，拿着手杖，鼻子很大；他灵巧地进了屋，用力关上身后装有闭门器的门，径直朝那个角落走了过去，往桌上放了一个包裹。他从口袋里掏出一只黄金包角的海豹皮钱包，向那个金发女郎出示了什么东西。她按了按桌上的一个电钮。那高个家伙走到隔间门前，打开刚能容身的一条缝，溜了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stretched out in one and lit a cigarette with the round nickel lighter on the smoking stand. She still stood, holding her lower lip with her teeth, her eyes vaguely troubled. She nodded at last, turned slowly and walked back to her little desk in the corner. From behind the lamp she stared at me. I crossed my ankles and yawned. Her silver nails went out to the cradle phone on the desk, didn't touch it, dropped and began to tap on the desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我四仰八叉躺在一张椅子上，用烟架上的镍打火机点了一根烟。她仍旧站着，牙齿抵住下唇，眼里隐约有些不安。最后她点了点头，缓缓转过身，走回了角落里的桌子后面。她在台灯后面盯着我。我搭起双脚，打了个哈欠。她把银指甲伸向桌上的电话机，却并没有碰它，而是放了下去，轻轻敲打着桌面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I finished my cigarette and lit another. The minutes dragged by. Horns tooted and grunted on the boulevard. A big red interurban car grumbled past. A traffic light gonged. The blonde leaned on her elbow and cupped a hand over her eyes and stared at me behind it. The partition door opened and the tall bird with the cane slid out. He had another wrapped parcel, the shape of a large book. He went over to the desk and paid money. He left as he had come, walking on the balls of his feet, breathing with his mouth open, giving me a sharp side glance as he passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我抽完手上的烟，又点了一根。时间缓慢地挨过去。大道上有刺耳尖利的汽车喇叭声。一辆红色的市际大轿车隆隆开过。交通灯鸣锣警示。金发女郎倚在手肘上，一只手掌拢成杯状放在眼前，注视着我。隔间的门开了，那撑着手杖的高个子溜了出来。他手里又有了个包裹，看形状是本大厚书。他走到桌前付了钱。他离开的样子跟来的时候一样：踮着脚走路，张着嘴呼吸，经过时用余光飞快地扫了我一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I got to my feet, tipped my hat to the blonde and went out after him. He walked west, swinging his cane in a small tight arc just above his right shoe. He was easy to follow. His coat was cut from a rather loud piece of horse robe with shoulders so wide that his neck stuck up out of it like a celery stalk and his head wobbled on it as he walked. We went a block and a half. At the Highland Avenue traffic signal I pulled up beside him and let him see me. He gave me a casual, then a suddenly sharpened side glance, and quickly turned away. We crossed Highland with the green light and made another block. He stretched his long legs and had twenty yards on me at the corner. He turned right. A hundred feet up the hill he stopped and hooked his cane over his arm and fumbled a leather cigarette case out of an inner pocket. He put a cigarette in his mouth, dropped his match, looked back when he picked it up, saw me watching him from the corner, and straightened up as if somebody had booted him from behind. He almost raised dust going up the block, walking with long gawky strides and jabbing his cane into the sidewalk. He turned left again. He had at least half a block on me when I reached the place where he had turned. He had me wheezing. This was a narrow tree-lined street with a retaining wall on one side and three bungalow courts on the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站起身，脱帽向金发女郎告辞，跟着他出了门。他向西边走去，手杖紧贴着右脚上方摆动着，弧度又小又急。要跟住他很容易。他的外套是鲜艳非凡的古董布料裁成，肩部非常宽阔，从衣领里戳出的脖子就像一根芹菜茎，脑袋还随着步伐摇摇晃晃。我们走过了一个半街区。走到高地大街的红绿灯前，我在他身旁立定，让他瞧见我。他先是漫不经心斜乜了我一眼，随后一怔，目光锐利起来，立马别过头去。绿灯了，我们穿过大街，又走了一个街区。他迈开他的大长腿赶路，到街角时，他在我身前二十码。他向右转了。往山上走了一百英尺，他停下了，把手杖挂在手臂上，从内侧袋里摸出一只皮制烟盒。他往嘴里塞了一根烟，擦燃火柴，一边点烟一边回头望，看到我在街角盯着他，他登时挺直了背，活像被人从身后踹了一脚。他笨拙滞重地大跨步往前走，手杖戳到了人行道上，简直要弄得尘土飞扬了。他又向左转了。等我赶到他转弯的地方，他至少领先我一整个街区。我追他追得直喘气。眼前是条林荫窄道，一边是挡土墙，另一边是三座花园平房的院落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sleeve behind the tree showed again, then a big nose and one eye and some sandy hair without a hat on it. The eye stared at me. It disappeared. Its mate reappeared like a woodpecker on the other side of the tree. Five minutes went by. It got him. His type are half nerves. I heard a match strike and then whistling started. Then a dim shadow slipped along the grass to the next tree. Then he was out on the walk coming straight towards me, swinging the cane and whistling. A sour whistle with jitters in it. I stared vaguely up at the dark sky. He passed within ten feet of me and didn't give me a glance. He was safe now. He had ditched it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树后的袖管又出现了，紧接着露面的是一个大鼻子、一只眼睛和没戴帽子的几绺浅棕色头发。那只眼睛注视着我。它不见了。另一只眼睛却又像啄木鸟似的出现在了树的另一边。五分钟缓缓过去。他忍不住了。这类人都是胆小鬼。我听到一声火柴的划擦，接着响起了口哨。那模糊的人影轻快地沿着草地溜到相邻的树前。随后他走到路上，径直朝我过来，一边甩手杖一边吹口哨。刺耳的口哨声里带着不安。我抬起头，茫然看着暗沉的天空。他经过我身旁，与我相距不到十英尺，却完全没看我。现在他安全了。他把东西藏好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was gone. I loafed along the block peering this way and that. At the second bungalow court I saw something. It was called "The La Baba," a quiet dim place with a double row of tree-shaded bungalows. The central walk was lined with Italian cypresses trimmed short and chunky, something the shape of the oil jars in Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. Behind the third jar a loud-patterned sleeve edge moved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不见了。我在小道上晃悠，这里那里打量着。走到第二座院子，有所发现了。那地方叫“拉·巴巴”，昏暗静谧，有两排树影下的平房。正中间的路两旁种了意大利柏树，都修剪得粗短敦实，有点像“阿里巴巴和四十大盗”里的油罐。第三个“油罐”后头露出一叶图案花哨的袖子，它动了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leaned against a pepper tree in the parkway and waited. The thunder in the foothills was rumbling again. The glare of lightning was reflected on piled-up black clouds off to the south. A few tentative raindrops splashed down on the sidewalk and made spots as large as nickels. The air was as still as the air in General Sternwood's orchid house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我倚在路旁的一棵胡椒树上，等待着。山麓那边又响起了隆隆的雷声。南边，层峦叠嶂的乌云上映出闪电的火光。几滴试探性的雨滴打在人行道上，留下五分硬币大小的水印。没有一丝风，空气如斯特恩伍德将军的兰花暖房里一般沉静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I watched him out of sight and went up the central walk of the La Baba and parted the branches of the third cypress. I drew out a wrapped book and put it under my arm and went away from there. Nobody yelled at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="目送他的身影消失后，我迈上“拉·巴巴”中央的小路，扳开第三棵柏树的枝杈。我抽出一本包裹着的书，夹在腋下，离开了那地方。并没有人喝令我放下东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
