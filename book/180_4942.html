<div class="line_en">Lily Briscoe knew all that. Sitting opposite him, could she not see, as in an X-ray photograph, the ribs and thigh bones of the young man's desire to impress himself, lying dark in the mist of his flesh -- that thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break into the conversation? But, she thought, screwing up her Chinese eyes, and remembering how he sneered at women, "can't paint, can't write," why should I help him to relieve himself?</div>

<div class="line_en">There is a code of behaviour, she knew, whose seventh article (it may be) says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman, whatever her own occupation might be, to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones, the ribs, of his vanity, of his urgent desire to assert himself; as indeed it is their duty, she reflected, in her old maidenly fairness, to help us, suppose the Tube were to burst into flames. Then, she thought, I should certainly expect Mr Tansley to get me out. But how would it be, she thought, if neither of us did either of these things? So she sat there smiling.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Tansley raised a hammer: swung it high in air; but realising, as it descended, that he could not smite that butterfly with such an instrument as this, said only that he had never been sick in his life. But in that one sentence lay compact, like gunpowder, that his grandfather was a fisherman; his father a chemist; that he had worked his way up entirely himself; that he was proud of it; that he was Charles Tansley -- a fact that nobody there seemed to realise; but one of these days every single person would know it. He scowled ahead of him. He could almost pity these mild cultivated people, who would be blown sky high, like bales of wool and barrels of apples, one of these days by the gunpowder that was in him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坦斯利先生举起了一把榔头，高高往天上一抡；但在榔头下落时意识到他不能用这样的工具来杀死一只蝴蝶，便仅仅说他从来没有晕过船。但就在这一句话里，就像子弹里的火药般密密实实地塞满了含义：他的祖父是个渔民；他的父亲是个药剂师：他完全靠自己得到了今天的地位；他为此而自豪；他就是查尔斯·坦斯利——在场的似乎没有人意识到这个事实；但总有一天会无人不知无人不晓。他沉着脸怒视着前方。他几乎要可怜这些温和而有教养的人了，总有一天他们会像一捆捆羊毛和一桶桶苹果那样被他体内的火药炸得飞上天去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Will you take me, Mr Tansley?" said Lily, quickly, kindly, for, of course, if Mrs Ramsay said to her, as in effect she did, "I am drowning, my dear, in seas of fire. Unless you apply some balm to the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there, life will run upon the rocks -- indeed I hear the grating and the growling at this minute. My nerves are taut as fiddle strings. Another touch and they will snap"-- when Mrs Ramsay said all this, as the glance in her eyes said it, of course for the hundred and fiftieth time Lily Briscoe had to renounce the experiment -- what happens if one is not nice to that young man there -- and be nice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你带我一齐去吗，坦斯利先生？”莉莉很快和善地问道。当然，如果拉姆齐夫人对她说——其实她等于这么说了——“亲爱的，我简直是处于水深火热之中了。你要是不能对那边那个年轻人说几句好听的，给痛苦的这一刻擦上点止痛膏，生活之船可就要触礁啦——说实话，此刻我已经能听见摩擦的吱嘎声和轰隆声了。我的神经像紧绷的琴弦，只要再碰一碰就会啪地断掉”——当拉姆齐夫人用眼神说着这—切时，莉莉·布里斯柯当然只得第—百五十次放弃那试验——看看如果你不好好对待那边那个年轻人会有什么结果——去好好对待他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Judging the turn in her mood correctly -- that she was friendly to him now -- he was relieved of his egotism, and told her how he had been thrown out of a boat when he was a baby; how his father used to fish him out with a boat-hook; that was how he had learnt to swim. One of his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the Scottish coast, he said. He had been there with him in a storm. This was said loudly in a pause. They had to listen to him when he said that he had been with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm. Ah, thought Lily Briscoe, as the conversation took this auspicious turn, and she felt Mrs Ramsay's gratitude (for Mrs Ramsay was free now to talk for a moment herself), ah, she thought, but what haven't I paid to get it for you? She had not been sincere.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had done the usual trick -- been nice. She would never know him. He would never know her. Human relations were all like that, she thought, and the worst (if it had not been for Mr Bankes) were between men and women. Inevitably these were extremely insincere she thought. Then her eye caught the salt cellar, which she had placed there to remind her, and she remembered that next morning she would move the tree further towards the middle, and her spirits rose so high at the thought of painting tomorrow that she laughed out loud at what Mr Tansley was saying. Let him talk all night if he liked it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But how long do they leave men on a Lighthouse?" she asked. He told her. He was amazingly well informed. And as he was grateful, and as he liked her, and as he was beginning to enjoy himself, so now, Mrs Ramsay thought, she could return to that dream land, that unreal but fascinating place, the Mannings' drawing-room at Marlow twenty years ago; where one moved about without haste or anxiety, for there was no future to worry about. She knew what had happened to them, what to her. It was like reading a good book again, for she knew the end of that story, since it had happened twenty years ago, and life, which shot down even from this dining-room table in cascades, heaven knows where, was sealed up there, and lay, like a lake, placidly between its banks. He said they had built a billiard room -- was it possible? Would William go on talking about the Mannings? She wanted him to. But, no -- for some reason he was no longer in the mood. She tried. He did not respond. She could not force him. She was disappointed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是他们让灯塔的看守在上面呆多长时间呀？”她问道。他告诉了她。他如此了解情况，真让人惊异。看到他对她的感激，看到他喜欢她，看到他开始觉得快活了，拉姆齐夫人想．现在她可以回到她的梦乡、那个虚幻但迷人的地方、二十年前曼宁家在马洛的那间客厅里去了；在那里你无忧无虑、不急不忙地走来走去，因为你还没有需要担忧的将来：她知道他们的遭遇，她也知道自己的遭遇。就像重读一本好书，她知道故事的结局，因为这已是二十年前的字事了，而生活，即使现在还在像瀑布般从这张餐桌奔流而下，天知道流向何方，在那儿却是封闭着的，像一个湖泊宁静地躺在堤岸之间。他说他们建了一间弹子房——这可能吗？威廉会继续谈论曼宁家的情况吗？她希望他会谈下去。但是不——不知什么原因他没有了那份心情。她试着让他谈下去。他毫无反映。她无法强迫他。她很失望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If at all," said Mrs Ramsay merely to fill up space, thinking what an old maid William was becoming. Conscious of his treachery, conscious of her wish to talk about something more intimate, yet out of mood for it at present, he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life, sitting there, waiting. Perhaps the others were saying something interesting? What were they saying?</div>

<div class="line_en">That the fishing season was bad; that the men were emigrating. They were talking about wages and unemployment. The young man was abusing the government. William Bankes, thinking what a relief it was to catch on to something of this sort when private life was disagreeable, heard him say something about "one of the most scandalous acts of the present government." Lily was listening; Mrs Ramsay was listening; they were all listening. But already bored, Lily felt that something was lacking; Mr Bankes felt that something was lacking. Pulling her shawl round her Mrs Ramsay felt that something was lacking. All of them bending themselves to listen thought, "Pray heaven that the inside of my mind may not be exposed," for each thought, "The others are feeling this. They are outraged and indignant with the government about the fishermen. Whereas, I feel nothing at all." But perhaps, thought Mr Bankes, as he looked at Mr Tansley, here is the man. One was always waiting for the man. There was always a chance. At any moment the leader might arise; the man of genius, in politics as in anything else. Probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies, thought Mr Bankes, doing his best to make allowances, for he knew by some curious physical sensation, as of nerves erect in his spine, that he was jealous, for himself partly, partly more probably for his work, for his point of view, for his science; and therefore he was not entirely open- minded or altogether fair, for Mr Tansley seemed to be saying, You have wasted your lives. You are all of you wrong. Poor old fogies, you're hopelessly behind the times. He seemed to be rather cocksure, this young man; and his manners were bad. But Mr Bankes bade himself observe, he had courage; he had ability; he was extremely well up in the facts. Probably, Mr Bankes thought, as Tansley abused the government, there is a good deal in what he says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在说今年的渔季不好；说渔民在迁移出去。他们在谈论工资和失业。那个年轻人在攻击政府。威廉·班克斯想，当不愿谈私人生活的时候，抓住这类话题可真让人心头轻松。他听见那人在说什么“当今政府最可耻的法令之—”。莉莉在听着；拉姆齐夫人在听着；大家都在听着。但是已经烦了，莉莉觉得好像缺了点什么；班克斯先生觉得好像缺了点什么；拉姆齐夫人把披巾在身上拉紧一些，觉得好像缺了点什么。所有俯身倾听的人都在想，“老天保佑我心里想的可别暴露出来，”因为每个人都在想，“别人都被打动了。他们都为渔民的事对政府感到义愤填膺，可是我却不为所动。”不过，也许，班克斯先生看着坦斯利先生时心里在想，那个人就在这里。人们总是在等待这个人的出现。这个可能性总是存在的。领袖随时可能出现，这是一个天才人物，在政治上和其他方面都是天才。也许我们这些老保守会觉得他非常讨厌，班克斯先生想，他尽量使自己宽容些，因为从身体的某种奇怪感觉，像脊背上的神经处于高度敏感时所感到的，他知道自己是在嫉妒，部分是嫉妒他这个人，更可能是嫉妒他的工作，嫉妒他的观点，他的科学；因此他不能做到完全坦城或公正，因为坦斯利先生似乎在说，你们浪费了生命，你们全都错了。可怜的老保守们，你们是毫无希望地落后于时代了。他似乎极其自信，这个年轻人；而且粗鲁无礼。但班克斯先生命令自己注意，他有勇气；他有能力；他事实掌握得极其充分。也许，在坦斯利攻击政府时班克斯先生想，他说的话很有道理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tell me now…" he said. So they argued about politics, and Lily looked at the leaf on the table-cloth; and Mrs Ramsay, leaving the argument entirely in the hands of the two men, wondered why she was so bored by this talk, and wished, looking at her husband at the other end of the table, that he would say something. One word, she said to herself. For if he said a thing, it would make all the difference. He went to the heart of things. He cared about fishermen and their wages. He could not sleep for thinking of them. It was altogether different when he spoke; one did not feel then, pray heaven Then, realising that it was because she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak, she felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their marriage, and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him. She looked at him thinking to find this in his face; he would be looking magnificent… But not in the least! He was screwing his face up, he was scowling and frowning, and flushing with anger. What on earth was it about? she wondered. What could be the matter? Only that poor old Augustus had asked for another plate of soup -- that was all. It was unthinkable, it was detestable (so he signalled to her across the table) that Augustus should be beginning his soup over again. He loathed people eating when he had finished. She saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes, his brow, and she knew that in a moment something violent would explode, and then -- thank goodness! she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on the wheel, and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not words. He sat there scowling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在请告诉我……”他说。于是他们争论起了政治问题，莉莉看着桌布图案上的叶片；拉姆齐夫人听任那两个男人去争辩，心里奇怪这谈话为什么让她感到如此厌倦，她看着坐在桌子另一端的丈夫，希望他会说点什么；只要一个字，她对自己说。因为如果他说点什么，情形就会大不—样。他总是能抓住事情的要害。他关心渔民和他们的工资。他常常因为想到他们而无法入睡。他说的时候情形完全不同；那时人们不会觉得，老天保佑你们别看出来我对这事多么不关心，因为现在他们关心了。随后她意识到这是因为她太钦佩他了，所以才等着他讲话，她感到似乎有人一直在向她称赞她的丈夫和他们的婚姻，这使她容光焕发，没有意识到称赞他的正是她自己。她看着他，想在他脸上看出这一点；他看去应该高贵轩昂……可却根本不是这样！他正皱着个脸，瞪着眼皱着眉，气得满脸通红。这究竟是什么原因？只不过是可怜的老奥古斯塔斯又要了一盘汤——如此而已。奥古斯塔斯竟然又重新喝起汤来，真是难以想像，令人厌恶（他隔着餐桌这样向她示意）。他讨厌别人在他吃完以后还在吃东西。她看见怒气像一群猎狗一样窜上他的眼睛里、额头上，她知道马上就会有什么猛烈的东西爆发出来，而那时——但是感谢上帝！她看见他控制住了自己，给轮子加上了闸，他整个的身体似乎迸发出了火星，但没有说出一个字来。">查看中文翻译</div>

He hated everything dragging on for hours like this. But he had controlled himself, Mr Ramsay would have her observe, disgusting though the sight was. But why show it so plainly, Mrs Ramsay demanded (they looked at each other down the long table sending these questions and answers across, each knowing exactly what the other felt).

<div class="line_en">Why could he never conceal his feelings? Mrs Ramsay wondered, and she wondered if Augustus Carmichael had noticed. Perhaps he had; perhaps he had not. She could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there, drinking his soup. If he wanted soup, he asked for soup. Whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same. He did not like her, she knew that; but partly for that very reason she respected him, and looking at him, drinking soup, very large and calm in the failing light, and monumental, and contemplative, she wondered what he did feel then, and why he was always content and dignified; and she thought how devoted he was to Andrew, and would call him into his room, and Andrew said, "show him things." And there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry, till he reminded one of a cat watching birds, and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word, and her husband said, "Poor old Augustus -- he's a true poet," which was high praise from her husband.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now eight candles were stood down the table, and after the first stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long table entire, and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit. What had she done with it, Mrs Ramsay wondered, for Rose's arrangement of the grapes and pears, of the horny pink-lined shell, of the bananas, made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea, of Neptune's banquet, of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the shoulder of Bacchus (in some picture), among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and gold… Thus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of great size and depth, was like a world in which one could take one's staff and climb hills, she thought, and go down into valleys, and to her pleasure (for it brought them into sympathy momentarily) she saw that Augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of fruit, plunged in, broke off a bloom there, a tassel here, and returned, after feasting, to his hive. That was his way of looking, different from hers. But looking together united them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some change at once went through them all, as if this had really happened, and they were all conscious of making a party together in a hollow, on an island; had their common cause against that fluidity out there. Mrs Ramsay, who had been uneasy, waiting for Paul and Minta to come in, and unable, she felt, to settle to things, now felt her uneasiness changed to expectation. For now they must come, and Lily Briscoe, trying to analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration, compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn, when solidity suddenly vanished, and such vast spaces lay between them; and now the same effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room, and the uncurtained windows, and the bright mask-like look of faces seen by candlelight. Some weight was taken off them; anything might happen, she felt. They must come now, Mrs Ramsay thought, looking at the door, and at that instant, Minta Doyle, Paul Rayley, and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together. They were awfully late; they were horribly late, Minta said, as they found their way to different ends of the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家立刻起了某种变化，好像这一切真的发生了，他们全都意识到他们是作为一个整体在岛屿上的一个洞穴里，有着共同的事业：对付外面那个流动的世界。拉姆齐夫人在等待保罗和明塔回来的时候心里一直感到不安，什么事情都无法定下心来处理，此时她觉得不安已变成了期待，因为他们现在一定会来了。莉莉·布里斯柯试图分析人们突然振奋起来的原因，和在网球场上的那一刻进行比较，那时好像紧密性突然消失，他们之间有着如此广阔的空间；而现在在这间只有很少几件家具、窗户上没有窗帘的房间里，许多燃烧的蜡烛产生了同样的效果，烛光下的一张张脸看起来像是光亮的面具，某些重负从他们身上解除了下来；她感到什么事都可能发生：他们现在总要来了吧，拉姆齐夫人想，眼睛看着门，就在这时，明培·多伊尔、保罗·雷勒和一个手里端者着大菜钵的女仆一起走了进来。他们来得太晚了；实在是太晚了，明塔说，他们分别向餐桌两端走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now all the candles were lit up, and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light, and composed, as they had not been in the twilight, into a party round a table, for the night was now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from giving any accurate view of the outside world, rippled it so strangely that here, inside the room, seemed to be order and dry land; there, outside, a reflection in which things waved and vanished, waterily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在所有的蜡烛都点燃了，烛光把桌子两旁的脸拉近了，使他们成了围桌而坐的一个整体，在刚才昏暗的夜色中就没有这种感觉，因为现在夜被关在了玻璃窗之外，玻璃窗不仅不能使人看到外面世界的真切景象，反而产生了奇特的波纹，以致让人感觉似乎在这儿，在房间里是整齐干燥的陆地；在那儿，在外面是一片水汪汪的倒影，一切事物都在其中波动、消失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How could she be such a goose, he asked, as to scramble about the rocks in jewels?</div>

<div class="line_en">"I lost my brooch -- my grandmother's brooch," said Minta with a sound of lamentation in her voice, and a suffusion in her large brown eyes, looking down, looking up, as she sat by Mr Ramsay, which roused his chivalry so that he bantered her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我把胸针给丢了——我祖母的胸针。”明塔说，声音中带着悲伤，棕色的大眼睛里闪着泪光。她坐在拉姆齐先生旁边，眼睛时而低垂、时而抬起，引起了拉姆齐先生对女人的骑士风度，和她善意地开起玩笑来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was by way of being terrified of him -- he was so fearfully clever, and the first night when she had sat by him, and he talked about George Eliot, she had been really frightened, for she had left the third volume of MIDDLEMARCH in the train and she never knew what happened in the end; but afterwards she got on perfectly, and made herself out even more ignorant than she was, because he liked telling her she was a fool. And so tonight, directly he laughed at her, she was not frightened. Besides, she knew, directly she came into the room that the miracle had happened; she wore her golden haze. Sometimes she had it; sometimes not. She never knew why it came or why it went, or if she had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at her. Yes, tonight she had it, tremendously; she knew that by the way Mr Ramsay told her not to be a fool. She sat beside him, smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她做出怕他的样子——他简直聪明得可怕，她第一次坐在他旁边的那个晚上，他大谈乔治·爱略特＊，真把她吓得够呛，因为她把《米得尔马契》的第三卷忘在火车上了，不知道故事结局；但是后来她和他相处得很好，她把自己表现得比实际上还要无知，因为他喜欢对她说她是个傻瓜。因此，今晚他一开始笑话她，她就不害怕了，而且，她一走进房间就知道奇迹出现了，她身上笼罩着一层金色的薄雾，这层薄雾有时出现，有时不出现。她从来也不如道它为什么来到，又为什么消失，也不知道当时有没有，一直要等她走进房间，才会从某个男人看她的神情上得知其存在。是的，今晚她有这层金色的薄雾，极大的一层；她从拉姆齐先生告诉她别傻时的神态知道了这一点。她坐在他旁边，微笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
