<div class="line_en">People said he was bitter. Maybe they were right. He'd never reflected much on it. People also called him antisocial. Ove assumed this meant he wasn't overly keen on people. And in this instance he could totally agree with them. More often than not people were out of their minds.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove wasn't one to engage in small talk. He had come to realize that, these days at least, this was a serious character flaw. Now one had to be able to blabber on about anything with any old sod who happened to stray within an arm's length of you purely because it was "nice." Ove didn't know how to do it. Perhaps it was the way he'd been raised. Maybe men of his generation had never been sufficiently prepared for a world where everyone spoke about doing things even though it no longer seemed worth doing them. Nowadays people stood outside their newly refurbished houses and boasted as if they'd built them with their own bare hands, even though they hadn't so much as lifted a screwdriver. And they weren't even trying to pretend that it was any other way. They boasted about it! Apparently there was no longer any value in being able to lay your own floorboards or refurbish a room with rising damp or change the winter tires. And if you could just go and buy everything, what was the value of it? What was the value of a man?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维不怎么喜欢磨嘴皮子。他知道如今这可算得上是了不得的人格缺陷。现在的人得能和闯入一臂距离之内的任何怪人叨叨任何事情，就是为了表示友好。欧维不知道怎么才能做到。或许这和他的成长环境有关。或许他这代人还没有准备好面对这样一个光说不练的世界。如今的人往新装修的房子门口一站，就开始拍胸脯，就好像房子是他们自己造的一样，哪怕他们其实连个螺丝刀都没举过。他们也不试着假装一下，还拿来吹嘘。显然自己动手铺实木地板、装修厕所或者换冬胎这种事已经没有什么价值可言了。能脚踏实地地做事已经不值一提了。平白无故就能掏钱想买啥买啥，这有什么价值？这样的人又有什么价值？">查看中文翻译</div>

He built her a bookshelf and she filled it with books by people who wrote page after page about their feelings. Ove understood things he could see and touch. Wood and concrete. Glass and steel. Tools. Things one could figure out. He understood right angles and clear instruction manuals. Assembly models and drawings. Things one could draw on paper.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only thing he had ever loved until he saw her was numbers. He had no other particular memory of his youth. He was not bullied and he wasn't a bully, not good at sports and not bad either. He was never at the heart of things and never on the outside. He was the sort of person who was just there. Nor did he remember so very much about his growing up; he had never been the sort of man who went around remembering things unless there was a need for it. He remembered that he was quite happy and that for a few years afterwards he wasn't -- that was about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">And he remembered the sums. The numbers, filling his head. Remembered how he longed for their mathematics lessons at school. Maybe for the others they were a sufferance, but not for him. He didn't know why, and didn't speculate about it either. He'd never understood the need to go around stewing on why things turned out the way they did. You are what you are and you do what you do, and that was good enough for Ove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他记得那些数字。数字装满了他的脑袋。他记得在学校的时候，他多专注于数学课。对别人来说，数学课就是噩梦，但他是个例外。他不知道为什么，也没思考过为什么。他从来不理解那些整天刨根问底追根溯源的人。是什么人做什么事，这就足够了，欧维总这么想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was seven years old when his mum called it a day one early August morning. She worked at a chemicals plant. In those days people didn't know much about air safety, Ove realized later. She smoked as well, all the time. That's Ove's clearest memory of her, how she sat in the kitchen window of the little house where they lived outside town, with that billowing cloud around her, watching the sky every Saturday morning. And how sometimes she sang in her hoarse voice and Ove used to sit under the window with his mathematics book in his lap, and he remembered that he liked listening to her. He remembers that. Of course, her voice was hoarse and the odd note was more discordant than one would have liked, but he remembers that he liked it anyway.</div>

<div class="line_en">His father never raised his fists. Not to Ove or anyone else. Ove had classmates who came to school with black eyes or bruises from a belt buckle after a thrashing. But never Ove. "We don't fight in this family," his father used to state. "Not with each other or anyone else."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove's father worked for the railways. The palms of his hands looked like someone had carved into leather with knives, and the wrinkles in his face were so deep that when he exerted himself the sweat was channeled through them down to his chest. His hair was thin and his body slender, but the muscles on his arms were so sharp that they seemed cut out of rock. Once when Ove was very young he was allowed to go with his parents to a big party with his dad's friends from the rail company. After his father had put away a couple of bottles of pilsner, some of the other guests challenged him to an arm-wrestling competition. Ove had never seen the like of these giants straddling the bench opposite him. Some of them looked like they weighed about four hundred pounds. His father wore down every one of them. When they went home that night, he put his arm around Ove's shoulders and said: "Ove, only a swine thinks size and strength are the same thing. Remember that." And Ove never forgot it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维的父亲是铁道工。他的手掌看上去就像用刀刻过的皮革，脸上皱纹深深，劳动的时候汗水就顺着这些沟壑淌到胸口。他头发稀疏身材精瘦，但手臂上的肌肉硬挺得就像直接从岩石上雕刻出来的一样。欧维很小的时候跟着父母到铁道上和父亲的同事们一起参加过一次盛大的庆祝活动。父亲几杯啤酒下肚，就有其他人来向他挑战掰腕子。欧维之前从没见过这些北欧战神模样的男人，岔开双腿往父亲跟前的木凳上一跨。其中有几个人看上去足有两百公斤，父亲各个击破。当晚他们回家，父亲用胳膊搂着欧维的肩膀说：“只有狗崽子才会觉得块头和力量是一码事，欧维，记住喽。”欧维永远不会忘记。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His father's only remaining words were about engines (apparently his mother was content to leave these behind). He could spend any amount of time talking about them. "Engines give you what you deserve," he used to explain. "If you treat them with respect they'll give you freedom; if you behave like an ass they'll take it from you."</div>

Every other day they put out food for a family of birds living in a rotting tree at the back of the house. It was important, Ove understood, that it had to be every other day. He didn't know why, but that didn't matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the daughter of the director was getting married and the wedding car broke down rather than ceremoniously transporting the bride to the church, Ove's father was sent for. He came cycling with a toolbox on his shoulder so heavy that it took two men to lift it when he got off the bicycle. Whatever the problem was when he arrived, it was no longer a problem when he cycled back. The director's wife invited him to the wedding reception, but he told her that it was probably not the done thing to sit with elegant people when one was the sort of man whose forearms were so stained with oil that it seemed a natural part of his pigmentation. But he'd gladly accept a bag of bread and meat for the lad at home, he said. Ove had just turned eight. When his father laid out the supper that evening, Ove felt like he was at a royal banquet.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time he did not own a car of his own, but in the 1940s and '50s, when the bosses and directors at the railway started buying their own vehicles, a rumor soon spread in the office that the quiet man working on the track was a person well worth knowing. Ove's father had never finished school, and didn't understand much about the sums in Ove's schoolbooks. But he understood engines.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few months later the director sent for Ove's father again. In the parking area outside the office stood an extremely old and worse-for-wear Saab 92. It was the first motorcar Saab had ever manufactured, although it had not been in production since the significantly upgraded Saab 93 had come onto the market. Ove's dad recognized it very well. Front-wheel-driven and a side-mounted engine that sounded like a coffee percolator. It had been in an accident, the director explained, sticking his thumbs into his suspenders under his jacket. The bottle-green body was badly dented and the condition of what lay under the hood was certainly not pretty. But Ove's father produced a little screwdriver from the pocket of his dirty overalls and after lengthily inspecting the car, he gave the verdict that with a bit of time and care and the proper tools he'd be able to put it back into working order.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever he had a Saturday off, Ove's father brought him out into the yard, opened the hood, and taught him all the names of the various parts and what they did. On Sundays they went to church. Not because either of them had any excessive zeal for God, but because Ove's mum had always been insistent about it. They sat at the back, each of them staring at a patch on the floor until it was over. And, in all honesty, they spent more time missing Ove's mum than thinking about God. It was her time, so to speak, even though she was no longer there. Afterwards they'd take a long drive in the countryside with the Saab. It was Ove's favorite part of the week.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a pat on his shoulder, the director returned to the office. Ove's father stayed where he was in the courtyard, trying to catch his breath. That evening he had to explain everything over and over again to his goggle-eyed son and show all there was to know about this magical monster now parked in their garden. He sat in the driver's seat half the night, with the boy on his lap, explaining how all the mechanical parts were connected. He could account for every screw, every little tube. Ove had never seen a man as proud as his father was that night. He was eight years old and decided that night he would never drive any car but a Saab.</div>

Tom had worked many years at the railway, but Ove had never heard any of his father's colleagues say one good word about Tom. He was dishonest and malicious, that was what they said after a couple of bottles of pilsner at their parties. But he'd never heard it from his dad. "Four children and a sick wife," was all he used to say to his workmates, looking each of them in the eye. "Better men than Tom could have ended up worse for it."

<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆的眼神阴暗起来。但他又后退了一步，仍然握着手提箱。他在铁道上工作了许多年，但欧维从来没从父亲的同事那里听到一句他的好话。他不老实，还很恶毒，欧维听到有人在那次聚会上灌下几杯啤酒后说。但他从没听父亲说过这些话。“四个孩子加一个胖老婆，”父亲曾经看着每一个同事的眼睛说，“比汤姆好的人也会变成他这样。”然后大家通常就会换个话题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove determinedly fixed his gaze on the ground, feeling Tom's eyes burning holes into the top of his head. Then he said in a low but unwavering voice that the lost property office would seem to be the best place to leave it. His father nodded without a word, and then took Ove's hand as they walked back for almost half an hour along the track without a word passing between them. Ove heard Tom shouting behind them, his voice filled with cold fury. Ove never forgot it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维牢牢地瞪着地板，感觉到汤姆的目光在他的头顶心烧出洞来。然后他用轻微却稳健的声音说，失物招领处是它最好的归宿。父亲一声不吭地点点头，拉起欧维的手，两个人沿着铁轨一言不发地走了半个小时。欧维听到汤姆在背后嘶叫，嗓音里充满了冰冷的愤怒。欧维永远也忘不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the funeral, the vicar wanted to talk to him about foster homes, but he found out soon enough that Ove had not been brought up to accept charity. At the same time, Ove made it clear to the vicar that there was no need to reserve a place for him in the pews at Sunday service for the foreseeable future. Not because Ove did not believe in God, he explained to the vicar, but because in his view this God seemed to be a bit of a bloody swine.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day he went down to the wages office at the railway and handed back the wages for the rest of the month. The ladies at the office didn't understand, so Ove had to impatiently explain that his father had died on the sixteenth, and obviously wouldn't be able to come in and work for the remaining fourteen days of that month. And because he got his wages in advance, Ove had come to pay back the balance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hesitantly the ladies asked him to sit down and wait. After fifteen minutes or so the director came out and looked at the peculiar sixteen-year-old sitting on a wooden chair in the corridor with his dead father's pay packet in his hand. The director knew very well who this boy was. And after he'd convinced himself that there was no way of persuading him to keep the money he felt he had no right to, the director saw no alternative but to propose to Ove that he should work for the rest of the month and earn his right to it. Ove thought this seemed a reasonable offer and notified his school that he'd be absent for the next two weeks. He never went back.</div>
