<div class="line_en">Jacob had left the little camp joyfully -- with a cheerful "I'll be right back" -- running full tilt for the clearing, already quivering as he prepared to shift to his other self. By now the whole pack knew everything. Seth Clearwater, pacing outside the tent, was an intimate witness to my disgrace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布兴高采烈地离开了宿营地——带着“我会回来的”喜悦之情——全速赶往那片空地，准备变成另一个他自己的时候已经开始颤抖了。到现在为止，整个狼群都知道了一切。塞思·克里尔沃特在帐篷外走来走去，是我的耻辱的鲜活的见证人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I lay facedown across the sleeping bag, waiting for justice to find me. Maybe an avalanche would bury me here. I wished it would. I never wanted to have to see my face in the mirror again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The tone of his voice worried me that my avalanche wasn't coming fast enough. I peeked up at him and, sure enough, his eyes were unfocused as he listened to something I'd rather die than have him hear. I dropped my face back to the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bella, did you really believe he was that noble? That he would go out in a flame of glory just to clear the way for me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉，你真的相信他那么高尚？他会带着胜利的荣耀全力以赴地为我让道？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And I thought I fought dirty," he said with grudging admiration. "He makes me look like the patron saint of ethics." His hand brushed against the part of my cheek that was exposed. "I'm not mad at you, love. Jacob's more cunning than I gave him credit for. I do wish you hadn't asked him, though."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还以为我竞争得不光彩呢，”他耿耿于怀，却又不无欣赏地说道，“他使我看起来像卫道士一样。”他的手轻轻地抚摸着我没有掩藏起来的那部分脸颊，“我不生你的气，我爱。雅各布比我想的还要狡猾，尽管我的确希望你没有要他那么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shh," he hushed me, his fingers soothing against my cheek. "That's not what I meant. It's just that he would have kissed you anyway -- even if you hadn't fallen for it -- and now I don't have an excuse to break his face. I would have really enjoyed that, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘘，”他让我别说话，手指轻轻地抚摸我的脸，“我不是那个意思。只是不管怎样他都会吻你的——即使你没有上当——现在我没有借口打碎他的脸了，我本来也会很享受那样的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I raised my head slowly to meet his patient gaze. His expression was soft; his eyes were full of understanding rather than the revulsion I deserved to see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我慢慢地抬起头，正视他耐心的凝视。他的表情很温柔，眼睛里充满理解，而不是我活该看见的厌恶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fallen for it?" I mumbled almost incomprehensibly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I did believe that," I muttered, and then looked away. But I didn't feel any anger at Jacob for tricking me. There wasn't enough room in my body to contain anything besides the hatred I felt toward myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我的确相信了。”我小声说道，接着看向别处去了，但是我并没有因为雅各布欺骗我而生他的气。除了对我自己的憎恶之外，我的身体里面没有足够的空间容纳其他东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你是个人。”他轻轻地说道，再次抚摸我的头发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think I got a fairly comprehensive look," he said in a light, easy voice. "Jacob makes vivid mental pictures. I feel almost as bad for his pack as I do for myself. Poor Seth was getting nauseated. But Sam is making Jacob focus now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想我相当全面地看了看，”他轻描淡写，从容地说道，“雅各布脑子里的情景非常生动。我几乎为他的狼群感到难过，就像我为我自己一样。可怜的塞思感到很恶心，但是山姆现在让雅各布集中精力了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I know that, too. But… when I left you, Bella, I left you bleeding. Jacob was the one to stitch you back up again. That was bound to leave its mark -- on both of you. I'm not sure those kinds of stitches dissolve on their own. I can't blame either of you for something I made necessary. I may gain forgiveness, but that doesn't let me escape the consequences."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我也知道，但是……当我离开你，贝拉，我让你流血了。雅各布是那个再次让你缝合起来的人，那一定会留下记号——在你们两个人身上。我不确定那种缝合是否会自己溶解，我不能因为由我造成的后果来责备你们两个中的任何一个。我可能会获得宽恕，但是那并不能让我避脱后果。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward growled.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They're talking about you." His teeth clenched together. "They're supposed to make sure you don't escape… Nice move, Leah! Mmm, she's quite fast," he murmured in approval. "One of the newborns caught our scent, and Leah took him down before he could even turn. Sam's helping her finish him off. Paul and Jacob got another one, but the others are on the defensive now. They have no idea what to make of us. Both sides are feinting… No, let Sam lead. Stay out of the way," he muttered. "Separate them -- don't let them protect each other's backs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们在谈论你，”他的牙齿紧紧地咬在一起，“他们应该确保不让你逃跑……干得漂亮，里尔！嗯，她非常快，”他小声地赞许道，“一个新生儿闻到我们的气味，里尔在他还没来得及跑之前就把它干掉了，山姆正帮她结果他呢。保罗和雅各布遇到另一个，但是其他的现在全在防御了，他们不知道我们是怎么构成的。双方都在佯攻……不，让山姆带队，别挡道，”他低声说道，“分散他们——别让他们保护彼此的后方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's better, drive them toward the clearing," Edward approved. His body was shifting unconsciously as he watched, tensing for moves he would have made. His hands still held mine; I twisted my fingers through his. At least he wasn't down there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那样好多了，把他们赶到空地上。”爱德华赞许道。他密切注视的时候身体不自觉地移动着，肌肉因为他会做的下个动作紧绷起来。他的手仍然握着我的，我用手指紧紧地扣住他的，至少他不会下山到那里去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I blinked, shocked, into the brilliant light. Seth was all I could see, right beside us, his face only six inches from Edward's. They stared at each other with absolute concentration for one infinite second. The sun shattered off Edward's skin and sent sparkles dancing across Seth's fur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对着耀眼的阳光眨了眨眼睛，惊恐万状。塞思是我唯一能看见的，就在我们身旁，他的脸离爱德华的只有六英寸。他们注意力绝对集中地互相盯着对方，像没有尽头一样看了片刻。阳光洒在爱德华的皮肤上，从他身上散发出的光芒散落在塞思的毛上闪闪发光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Relief again. If it had been the Volturi, we were both dead. But with Victoria, it didn't have to be both. Edward could survive this. He was a good fighter, as good as Jasper.

There was a striking feline quality to the way she held her coiled body, a lioness waiting for an opening to spring.
