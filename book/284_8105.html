<div class="line_en">"We'd never get on as comfortable as we do," Mrs. Sowerby said, "if it wasn't for Dickon's garden. Anything'll grow for him. His 'taters and cabbages is twice th' size of any one else's an' they've got a flavor with 'em as nobody's has."</div>

<div class="line_en">The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in. Round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother. In the company of his "creatures" he did wonders there and was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him. After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day. She loved this time. There were not only vegetables in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flower-seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps. The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he had tucked moorland fox-glove into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她有点闲工夫的时候，她喜欢出去和他聊天。晚饭以后，还有长长一段明亮的暮光可以做事，那是她静下来的时候。她可以坐在粗砺的矮墙上一直瞧着，听着当天的故事。她喜欢这个时刻。园子里不只是蔬菜。迪肯断断续续买来几分钱一包的花子，把一些鲜艳、好闻的东西种在醋栗丛甚至卷心菜中间，他在边沿种了一排排的木樨、石竹、三色堇等等，这些东西的种籽他可以一年年保存起来，要不它们的根会每年春天开花，及时扩展成好看的一簇簇。矮墙是约克郡最漂亮的一景，因为他早前往每个缝里塞了牧尔上的毛地黄、蕨草、石水芹和各种篱笆花草，直到只能偶尔看到几抹石头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him, the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，在一个美丽宁静的傍晚，迪肯讲出了整个故事，包括所有激荡人心的细节：埋起来的钥匙，知更鸟，看起来如同死亡的灰色雾霭，玛丽小姐原本打算永不透露的秘密。迪肯来临，如何被通告给他，柯林少爷的怀疑，他被介绍进入迷藏的领地，这是最后一幕戏剧，再加上季元本从墙头露出愤怒的面孔，柯林少爷愤慨之下力量突发，这一切让索尔比太太好看的脸很是变了几次颜色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive, mother," he would say, "is to be friends with 'em for sure. They're just like th' 'creatures.' If they're thirsty give em drink and if they're hungry give em a bit o' food. They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as if I'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要让它们长得茂盛，人要做的，妈妈，”他会说，“不过是和它们交朋友。它们就像‘生灵’。要是它们渴了，给它们水喝，要是它们饿了，给它们点吃的。它们想和我们一样活着。要是它们死了，我会觉得自己好像是个坏人，对它们没心没肺。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that "Mester Colin' had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him good. But it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might "come into the secret." Somehow it was not doubted that she was "safe for sure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就是在这些微光中的钟点里，索尔比太太听到了发生在米瑟韦斯特庄园发生的一切。起初她只听到“柯林少爷”迷上的和玛丽小姐出门到庭园里去，这对他好。然而没过多久，两个孩子就达成一致，迪肯的妈妈可以“参与秘密”。不知怎的她毫无疑问是“肯定安全”的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Him an Miss Mary's both got to enjoyin' it an' when he groans an' complains she'll say, 'Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so weak as that, poor Colin?'-- but th' trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin' out laughin'. When we get safe into the garden they laugh till they've no breath left to laugh with.

<div class="line_en">"I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary," Colin always ended by saying. "We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do wish," Colin would say also, "I do wish the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one."</div>

<div class="line_en">He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the table -- particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover -- they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他决意少吃一些，可是，不幸得很，这个精彩的点子根本不可能实现，每天早晨当他醒来，胃口奇好，而沙发近旁的桌子放着早点，家里做的面包和新鲜黄油、雪白的鸡蛋、木莓酱和凝结奶油。玛丽总是和他一起吃早饭，当他们不觉来到桌前——特别要是一片片精美的滋滋冒油的火腿从滚烫的银罩子下散发出诱人的香气——他们会绝望地看着对方的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But they never found they could send away anything and the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened much comment.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's enough for a person who is going to die," answered Mary when first she heard this, "but it's not enough for a person who is going to live. I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“够一个要死的人。”玛丽刚刚听到这话时这么回答，“但是不够一个要活下去的人。有时候我觉得可以吃上三个，当新鲜的石楠花和荆豆花那好闻的味道从打开的窗户涌进来的时候。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning that Dickon -- after they had been enjoying themselves in the garden for about two hours -- went behind a big rose-bush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness. What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind, clever woman she must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious fresh milk!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早上，迪肯——等他们在花园里自在了两个钟头以后——走到一大丛玫瑰后面，拿出两个白铁桶，揭示一桶装满了浓郁的新鲜牛奶，顶上是奶油；另一桶装着农家做的葡萄干小圆面包，包在一张干净的蓝白色手帕里，小圆面包塞得那么仔细，还是热的，一阵惊喜交加的狂欢。索尔比太太想到这个实在太美妙了！她是多么好心、聪明的女人！小圆面包真好吃啊！新鲜牛奶多么可口！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他忘记了自己的庄严堂皇，一头扎进去，给自己塞满小面包，从桶里一口又一口地喝着牛奶，就像任何一个饥饿的小男孩，进行了不寻常的锻炼，呼吸牧尔上的空气，早饭已经是两个多钟头以前的事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king -- besides being deliciously satisfying. You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪肯有一个激动人心的发现，在花园外的公共林地上的林子里，玛丽第一次见到他对野生动物们吹笛子，那里有一个小小深坑，你可以用石头造一个小灶，在里面烤土豆和鸡蛋。烤鸡蛋以前是未发现的珍馐，滚烫的土豆里面加盐和新鲜黄油正适合森林大王——另外也美味、饱肚子。土豆和鸡蛋，你可以想买多少买多少，不用觉得自己好像在从十四个人口中夺食。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always took his walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly found power at intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground. And each day his belief in the Magic grew stronger -- as well it might. He tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him the best things of all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个美丽的早晨，李树下神秘的圆圈施弄着魔法，短暂的花期过去后，李树捧出浓密叶片组成的一顶华盖。那个仪式之后，柯林总是走路锻炼，整个白天他每隔一段时间就锻炼自己新发现的力量。每一天他长得更强壮，走得更稳当，走得更远。每一天他对魔法的信念更强烈——魔法也可能更强烈。他尝试一个又一个实验，因为他觉得自己力气在增长，是迪肯给展示给他所有事情里最有趣的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind. They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every day. So they asked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是许多类似的如意巧合的开始。他们居然醒过来，想起索尔比太太要给十四个人弄吃的，她也许没有足够的食物每天满足两个额外的肚子。于是他们请她允许他们送去一些先令买东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yesterday," he said one morning after an absence, "I went to Thwaite for mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth. He's the strongest chap on th' moor. He's the champion wrestler an' he can jump higher than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther. He's gone all th' way to Scotland for th' sports some years. He's knowed me ever since I was a little 'un an' he's a friendly sort an' I axed him some questions. Th' gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o' thee, Mester Colin, and I says, 'How did tha' make tha' muscles stick out that way, Bob? Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?' An' he says, 'Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle in my body. An' I says, 'Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with 'em, Bob?' an' he laughed an' says, 'Art tha' th' delicate chap?' an' I says, 'No, but I knows a young gentleman that's gettin' well of a long illness an' I wish I knowed some o' them tricks to tell him about.' I didn't say no names an' he didn't ask none. He's friendly same as I said an' he stood up an' showed me good-natured like, an' I imitated what he did till I knowed it by heart."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="柯林一直在兴奋地听着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From that time the exercises were part of the day's duties as much as the Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have been lost. But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从此以后锻炼和魔法一样，成了每天的任务。柯林和玛丽每次试做，都可能能够做更多，结果他们胃口之好，等迪肯每天早晨把篮子放到玫瑰丛后，他们却已经没有胃口了。不过坑里的小灶和索尔比太太的慷慨是如此饱肚子，莫得劳克太太、护士和克兰文医生又迷惑起来了。你可以对早饭无所谓，对晚饭显出蔑视，假如你已经满到了口沿，里面填着烤鸡蛋、烤土豆、浓郁得带泡沫的新鲜牛奶、燕麦饼和凝固奶油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye, to be sure," Dickon answered, getting up. "But he says tha' mun do 'em gentle at first an' be careful not to tire thysel'. Rest in between times an' take deep breaths an' don't overdo."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎是，当然了。”迪肯一边回答一边起来，“不过他说，你开初一定要轻柔，小心不要太累。要在中间休息，呼吸要深，不能过分。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them with widening eyes. He could do a few while he was sitting down. Presently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet. Mary began to do them also. Soot, who was watching the performance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly because he could not do them too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪肯从草地上站起来，慢慢过了一遍一套精心设计、实用而简单的肌肉训练。柯林瞪大了眼睛看着。他坐着，只能做几个动作。然后等他站在已经稳当的腿上，他轻柔地做了几个。玛丽也开始做。煤灰看着表演，非常困扰，离开树枝，不安地四处蹦跳，因为它也不能做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They are eating next to nothing," said the nurse. "They'll die of starvation if they can't be persuaded to take some nourishment. And yet see how they look."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully. He wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at -- but he was even more worried when he sat down by Colin's sofa and examined him. He had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks. When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left Colin's skin and a warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out. His once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were fuller and of a normal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his chin in his hand and thought him over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克兰文医生来看柯林，看得很久很仔细。当护士跟他说话，拿给他看几乎原封未动的一托盘早餐，她保存下来给他看的，他挂起一副极度忧虑的表情——但是等他坐在柯林的沙发旁检查他，他的表情更加忧虑。他早先被叫到伦敦出差，有几乎两周没有见到这孩子。年轻人一旦开始康复就很快。那层浅浅的蜡色消失了，柯林的皮肤和温暖的玫瑰色透显出来；他漂亮的眼睛很清澈，眼睛下面、脸颊上、太阳穴上的坑已经填满了。他一度黝黑、浓密的发卷开始显得好似健康地从前额弹开，柔软、温暖、有生气。他的嘴唇饱满，颜色正常。实际上，模仿一个确定有残疾的男孩，他的景象实在是丢脸。克兰文医生捏着下巴，反复琢磨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look!" exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. "Eh! I'm moithered to death with them. They're a pair of young Satans. Bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday -- and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them -- and back it's sent. She almost cried. She's afraid she'll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧！”莫得劳克太太愤愤不平地喊，“啊！我对他们要困惑死了。他们是一对小圣诞老人。今天把外套都涨破了，明天对厨师最诱人的饭菜翘起鼻子。昨天一口也没动那可爱的童子鸡，面包蘸酱叉子沾都没沾——可怜的女人为他们精心发明了一种布丁——被送了回来。她几乎哭了起来。她害怕要是他们把自己饿进了棺材，会怪罪她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，”后来她对柯林说，“我止不住了。就那么冲了出去，因为突然我忍不住想起你吃掉的最后一个大土豆，你的嘴巴张开、咬透厚厚的硬皮的样子，上面还有果酱和凝结奶油。”">查看中文翻译</div>
