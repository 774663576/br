<div class="line_en">I got to know Bolo because he was one of my tuck-shop clients. Bolo's parents were professional pirates. They pirated videogames and sold them at flea markets. As the son of pirates, Bolo did the same thing -- he started selling bootleg PlayStation games around school. Kids would give him their PlayStation, and he'd bring it back a few days later with a chip in it that enabled them to play pirated games, which he would then sell them. Bolo was friends with this white kid and fellow pirate named Andrew, who traded in bootleg CDs. Andrew was two grades above me and a real computer geek; he even had a CD writer at home, back when nobody had CD writers.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was in grade nine, three Chinese kids transferred to Sandringham: Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John. They were the only Chinese kids in the school, out of a thousand pupils. Bolo got his nickname because he looked like Bolo Yeung from the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Bloodsport. Bruce Lee's name really was Bruce Lee, which made our lives. Here was this Chinese guy, quiet, good-looking, in great shape, and his name was Bruce Lee. We were like, This is magic. Thank you, Jesus, for bringing us Bruce Lee. John was just John, which was weird because of the other two.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day on my tuck-shop rounds, I overheard Andrew and Bolo complaining about the black kids at school. They'd realized that they could take Andrew's and Bolo's merchandise, say "I'll pay you later," and then not pay, because Andrew and Bolo were too scared of black people to go back to ask for the money. I leaned in to their conversation and said, "Listen, you shouldn't get upset. Black people don't have any money, so trying to get more stuff for less money is just what we do. But let me help. I'll be your middleman. You give me the merchandise and I'll sell it, and then I'll handle getting the money. In return, you give me a cut of the sale." They liked the idea right away, and we became partners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，我正分发小卖部客户的午餐，偶然听到安德鲁和博洛在抱怨学校里的黑人小孩。他们先从安德鲁和博洛那拿货，嘴上说着“过会儿再给钱”，可转身就不付账了，而安德鲁和博洛因为害怕黑人小孩的抱团势力，从来不敢去要。我插进他们的对话里，说：“听着，不要不开心了。黑人就是没钱，所以我们就是喜欢用最少的钱得到最多的东西。不过我来帮你们吧，我可以当你们的中间人。你们把货给我，我来卖，我来负责要账。你们只要给我一点儿分成就行了。”他们立刻同意了这个主意，我们成了生意伙伴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the tuck-shop guy, I was perfectly positioned. I had my network set up. All I had to do was tap into it. With the money I made selling CDs and videogames, I was able to save up and add new components and more memory to my own computer. Andrew the computer geek showed me how to do it, where to buy the cheapest parts, how to assemble them, how to repair them. He showed me how his business worked, too, how to download music, where to get rewritable CDs in bulk. The only thing I was missing was my own CD writer, because it was the most expensive component. At the time a CD writer cost as much as the rest of the computer, nearly 2,000 rand.</div>

<div class="line_en">I worked as a middleman for Bolo and Andrew for a year. Then Bolo left school; the rumor was that his parents got arrested. From that point on I worked for Andrew, and then as he was about to matriculate he decided to quit the game. "Trevor," he told me, "you've been a loyal partner." And, as thanks, he bequeathed unto me his CD writer. At the time, black people barely had access to computers, let's start there. But a CD writer? That was the stuff of lore. It was mythical. The day Andrew gave it to me, he changed my life. Thanks to him, I now controlled production, sales, distribution -- I had everything I needed to lock down the bootleg business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我给博洛和安德鲁当了一年的中间商后，博洛离开了学校，有传言说，是因为他父母被逮捕了。从那一刻起，我便开始只为安德鲁工作，但当时他已经快要毕业，所以决定退出这项事业。“特雷弗，”他对我说，“你是个很可靠的合作伙伴。”为了感谢我，他把自己那台刻录机送给了我。让我们先说清楚，那个时候，黑人几乎接触不到电脑，所以，一台刻录机？那简直是传奇，是神话。安德鲁把那台刻录机送我的那天，我的人生从此改变了。感谢安德鲁，我现在掌控了生产线、销售线和配送线——我拥有了垄断整个盗版事业的一切条件。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was a natural capitalist. I loved selling stuff, and I was selling something that everybody wanted and nobody else could provide. I sold my discs for 30 rand, around $3. A regular CD in the store cost 100 to 150 rand. Once people started buying from me, they wouldn't buy real CDs ever again -- the deal was too good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是个天生的资本家。我喜欢卖东西，而且我喜欢卖那些所有人都想要但是没有人能提供的东西。我的碟售价只要30兰特，约为3美元。商店里的正常CD价格是100到150兰特。一旦人们开始从我手里购买，他们就再也不会去买正版碟了——我的价格实在太划算。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had an instinct for business, but at the time I knew nothing about music, which was odd for someone running a music-pirating business. The only music I knew, still, was Christian music from church, the only music allowed in my mother's house. The CD writer Andrew gave me was a 1x CD writer, which meant it copied at the speed it played. Every day I'd leave school, go to my room, and sit for five to six hours, copying CDs. I had my own surround-sound system built with old car speakers I'd salvaged from the junkers Abel kept in the yard, and I strung them up around the room. Even though I had to sit there while each CD played, for a long time I didn't really listen to them. I knew it was against the dealer's code: Never get high on your own supply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我生来就会做生意，但是那时我对音乐毫无概念，这对一个做盗版音乐生意的人来说，大概是很奇怪的事。我所了解的唯一音乐类型，就是教堂的基督教音乐，这是我妈允许在家里播放的音乐。安德鲁给我的是LX刻录机，只能按照播放的速度同步刻录。每天我放学回家，就会在自己的房间里坐上五六个小时，刻录CD。我从院子里亚伯的那堆废铁里挑出一些能用的老旧车载播放器，把它们绑在房间的各个角落，做成了我自己的环绕立体声音响系统。尽管每张CD在播放的时候我都坐在一旁，但我并不会认真去听它们在放什么。我了解毒贩子的法则：不能嗑你自己卖的药。">查看中文翻译</div>

You wanted the new DMX, I got you the new DMX. Local South African music was big, but black American music was what people were desperate for, hip-hop and R&amp;B. Jagged Edge was huge. 112 was huge.

<div class="line_en">When I started, I had a dial-up connection and a 24k modem. It would take a day to download an album. But technology kept evolving, and I kept reinvesting in the business. I upgraded to a 56k modem. I got faster CD writers, multiple CD writers. I started downloading more, copying more, selling more. That's when I got two middlemen of my own, my friend Tom, who went to Northview, and my friend Bongani, who lived in Alex.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚起步的时候，我用的是拨号上网和一个24k的调制解调器。下载一张专辑需要花一天的时间。但科技在进步，所以我也一直在给我的事业进行投资。我把调制解调器换成了56k的，买了一个速度更快、支持多重录制的刻录机。我开始下载得更多，盗版得更多，卖得更多。这时，我拥有了两个为我干活的中间商，一个是我的朋友汤姆，他负责在北景一带贩售，还有一个是我朋友邦哈尼，他负责亚历山德拉一带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day Bongani came to me and said, "You know what would make a lot of money? Instead of copying whole albums, why don't you put the best tracks of different albums onto one CD, because people only wanna hear the songs they like." That sounded like a great idea, so I started making mix CDs. Those sold well. Then a few weeks later Bongani came back and said, "Can you make the tracks fade into one another so the music moves from track one to track two without a break and the beat carries on? It'll be like a DJ playing a complete set the whole night." That sounded like a great idea, too. I downloaded a program called BPM, "beats per minute." It had a graphical interface that looked like two vinyl records side by side, and I could mix and fade between songs, basically everything a DJ can do live. I started making party CDs, and those started selling like hotcakes, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天邦哈尼来找我，对我说：“你知道怎么才能赚更多钱吗？与其直接刻录整张专辑，你为什么不把不同专辑的主打歌刻进同一张碟里呢？反正人们只喜欢听自己中意的那几首。”这听上去是个不错的主意，我开始制作混曲CD。这些碟卖得很不错。几周后，邦哈尼又来找我，说：“你可以让一首歌的结尾慢慢淡出，直接融入下一首歌的开头吗？这样每首歌之间就没有间隙了，而鼓点一直不会间断，就好像是DJ整晚打碟那样。”这听上去也是个不错的主意。我下载了一个叫BPM的软件——“分钟节拍”——它的图标就是两张黑胶唱片叠在一起，我用这个软件可以进行混曲，将两首歌的首尾连在一起。基本上就是DJ在现场做的所有事情，我都可以用这个软件实现。我开始制作派对音乐CD，这些碟也成了香饽饽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first time in my life I had money, and it was the most liberating thing in the world. The first thing I learned about having money was that it gives you choices. People don't want to be rich. They want to be able to choose. The richer you are, the more choices you have. That is the freedom of money.</div>

It's a shit salary if you're trying to support a family, but as a sixteen-year-old living at home with no real expenses, I was living the dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">With money, I experienced freedom on a whole new level: I went to McDonald's. People in America don't understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy. That's true to this day. A Burger King opened for the first time in South Africa last year, and there was a queue around the block. It was an event. Everyone was going around saying, "I have to eat at Burger King. Have you heard? It's from America." The funny thing was that the queue was actually just white people. White people went bat-shit crazy for Burger King. Black people were like, whatever. Black people didn't need Burger King. Our hearts were with KFC and McDonald's. The crazy thing about McDonald's is that we knew about it long before it came, probably from movies. We never even dreamed we would ever get one in South Africa; McDonald's seemed to us like one of those American things that is exclusively American and can't go anywhere else. Even before we ever tasted McDonald's, we knew we'd love it, and we did. At one point South Africa was opening more McDonald's than any other country in the world. With Mandela came freedom -- and with freedom came McDonald's. A McDonald's had opened up just two blocks from our house not long after we moved to Highlands North, but my mom would never pay for us to eat there. With my own money I was like, Let's do this. I went all in. They didn't have "supersize" at the time; "large" was the biggest. So I walked up to the counter, feeling very impressed with myself, and I put down my money and said, "I'll have a large number one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有了钱，我对自由的体会上升了一个新高度：我可以去吃麦当劳了。美国人民大概并不了解，每当一个美国连锁店在第三世界国家开业的时候，人们都会趋之若鹜。直到今天也是一样的。去年，南非第一家汉堡王开业了，队伍一直排到街角。这是大事件。每个人都奔走相告：“我要去吃一下汉堡王。你听说了吗？是美国来的。”不过好笑的是，排队的大部分都是白人。白人为汉堡王而疯狂。黑人却觉得一般般。黑人并不需要汉堡王。我们的心是属于肯德基和麦当劳的。在麦当劳进到南非来以前，我们就知道它了，也许是从电影里吧。我们从来没有梦想过南非也能有麦当劳；麦当劳给人感觉就像那种只在美国才有的东西，不会到别处开店。甚至在我们尝到麦当劳以前，我们就已经爱上了它，而且事实是，我们也的确爱它。有一段时间，在南非开业的麦当劳，比世界任何一个国家都多。曼德拉带来了自由，自由带来了麦当劳。我们搬去高地北后，离我们家两个街区的地方有一家麦当劳，但是我妈从来不带我们去那里吃。而手里攥着我自己挣的钱，我心想，来吧。我鼓足了干劲。那时候他们还没有“超大份”餐，“大份”就是最大的了。我走到柜台前，深深为自己感到骄傲，放下钱，说：“我要大份一号餐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

What they don't say is, "And it would be nice if you gave him a fishing rod." That's the part of the analogy that's missing. Working with Andrew was the first time in my life I realized you need someone from the privileged world to come to you and say, "Okay, here's what you need, and here's how it works."

His family had access to education, resources, computers. For generations, while his people were preparing to go to university, my people were crowded into thatched huts singing, "Two times two is four. Three times two is six. La la la la la." My family had been denied the things his family had taken for granted. I had a natural talent for selling to people, but without knowledge and resources, where was that going to get me?

If you own a tent, you have the right to throw a party in your street. Cars creep up to the intersection and the driver will see the party blocking their way and shrug and make a U-turn. Nobody gets upset. The only rule is that if you throw a party in front of somebody's house, they get to come and share your alcohol. The parties don't end until someone gets shot or a bottle gets broken on someone's face. That's how it has to end; otherwise, it wasn't a party.</div>

By midnight the whole street was packed from one end to the other. Ours was the biggest New Year's Eve party in Alexandra that year, and to have the biggest party in Alexandra is no joke. All night, from far and wide, people kept coming. The word spread: "There's a light-skinned guy who plays music on a computer. You've never seen anything like it." I DJ'd by myself until dawn.

He had a looseness and a fluidity that defied physics -- imagine a jellyfish if it could walk on land. Incredibly handsome, too, tall and lithe and muscular, with beautiful, smooth skin, big teeth, and a great smile, always laughing. And all he did was dance.

<div class="line_en">Thanks to my computer and modem I was getting exclusive tracks few people had access to, but that created a problem for me. Sometimes I'd play the new music at parties and people would stand around going, "What is this? How do you dance to it?" For example, if a DJ plays a song like "Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)"-- yes, it's a catchy song, but what is a whip? What is a nae nae? For that song to be popular you have to know how to do the whip and the nae nae; new music works at parties only if people know how to dance to it. Bongani decided we needed a dance crew to show people the steps to the songs we were playing. Because we spent our days doing nothing but listening to CDs and coming up with dance moves, our crew from the corner already knew all the songs, so they became our dancers. And hands down the best, most beautiful, most graceful dancer in the crew was Bongani's neighbor, Hitler.</div>

I'd warm the crowd up with a few songs, then the dancers would come out and do a couple of numbers. Once they'd gotten the party started, they'd fan out to form a semicircle around the stage with a gap in the back for Hitler to enter. I'd crank up Redman's "Let's Get Dirty" and start whipping the crowd up even more. "Are you ready?! I can't hear you! Let me hear you make some noise!" People would start screaming, and Hitler would jump into the middle of the semicircle and the crowd would lose it. Hitler would do his thing while the guys circled around him, shouting him on. "Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler!" And because this was hip-hop, the crew would do that thing where you shoot your arm out in front of you with your palm flat, bopping it up and down to the beat. "Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler!" We'd have the whole crowd in a frenzy, a thousand people in the street chanting along with their hands in the air. "Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler! Go Hit-ler!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but really it's a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved up Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him. White people don't talk to black people. So why would black people know what's going on in the white man's world? Because of that, many black people in South Africa don't really know who Hitler was. My own grandfather thought "a hitler" was a kind of army tank that was helping the Germans win the war. Because that's what he took from what he heard on the news. For many black South Africans, the story of the war was that there was someone called Hitler and he was the reason the Allies were losing the war. This Hitler was so powerful that at some point black people had to go help white people fight against him -- and if the white man has to stoop to ask the black man for help fighting someone, that someone must be the toughest guy of all time. So if you want your dog to be tough, you name your dog Hitler. If you want your kid to be tough, you name your kid Hitler. There's a good chance you've got an uncle named Hitler. It's just a thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西方人对这样的取名方式感到震惊且迷惑，但是，这其实是西方人自食其果的典例。殖民者瓜分了非洲，让黑人变成劳动力，但与此同时，却并没有给予他们应得的教育。白人也不会和黑人交流，所以黑人怎么会了解白人世界发生了什么？正因为如此，很多南非的黑人并不知道希特勒是谁。我自己的外公就以为“希特勒”是那种帮助德国赢得了战争的军用坦克，所以他会说“一台希特勒”。因为那是他从新闻里捕捉到的零碎信息。对于很多南非黑人来说，“二战”的故事梗概就是有个叫希特勒的人，让同盟国输掉了战争。希特勒太强大了，以至于到了某个阶段，黑人要去帮白人打仗——如果白人会屈尊请黑人帮自己打什么人，那这个人肯定是史上的最强者。如果你希望自己的狗变得威风凛凛，你可以给自己的狗起名叫希特勒。如果你希望你自己的小孩变得坚韧顽强，就给你的小孩起名叫希特勒。所以很有可能你会拥有一个叫希特勒的舅舅。这只是一种起名习惯罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hitler, although an unusual name, is not unheard-of in South Africa. Part of it has to do with the way a lot of black people pick names. Black people choose their traditional names with great care; those are the names that have deeply personal meanings. But from colonial times through the days of apartheid, black people in South Africa were required to have an English or European name as well -- a name that white people could pronounce, basically. So you had your English name, your traditional name, and your last name: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. Nine times out of ten, your European name was chosen at random, plucked from the Bible or taken from a Hollywood celebrity or a famous politician in the news. I know guys named after Mussolini and Napoleon. And, of course, Hitler.</div>

We weren't taught to think critically about Hitler and anti-Semitism and the Holocaust.

We weren't taught how to think about how Hitler related to the world we lived in. We weren't being taught to think, period.

But I often wonder, with African atrocities like in the Congo, how horrific were they? The thing Africans don't have that Jewish people do have is documentation. The Nazis kept meticulous records, took pictures, made films. And that's really what it comes down to. Holocaust victims count because Hitler counted them. Six million people killed. We can all look at that number and rightly be horrified. But when you read through the history of atrocities against Africans, there are no numbers, only guesses. It's harder to be horrified by a guess. When Portugal and Belgium were plundering Angola and the Congo, they weren't counting the black people they slaughtered. How many black people died harvesting rubber in the Congo? In the gold and diamond mines of the Transvaal?</div>

<div class="line_en">The day of the event, we booked a minibus, loaded it up with our gear, and drove over. Once we arrived we waited in the back of the school's assembly hall and watched the acts that went onstage before us, different groups took their turns performing, flamenco dancers, Greek dancers, traditional Zulu musicians. Then we were up. We were billed as the Hip Hop Pantsula Dancers -- the South African B-Boys. We set up our sound system onstage. I looked out, and the whole hall was nothing but Jewish kids in their yarmulkes, ready to party.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了文化日那天，我们订了一辆小巴，装上我们的设备，开了过去。到了以后，我们待在学校礼堂后面候场，同时观看了在我们之前登台的表演。有弗拉明戈舞蹈、希腊舞蹈、传统祖鲁音乐轮番上阵。接着轮到了我们。我们被宣传为嘻哈喷特拉舞团——南非街舞男孩。我们把音响系统在舞台上装好后，我望向台下，看到整个大厅里都坐满了头戴圆顶小帽的犹太孩子，跃跃欲试准备开派对。">查看中文翻译</div>

The teachers, the chaperones, the parents, the hundreds of Jewish kids in their yarmulkes -- they froze and stared aghast at us up on the stage. I was oblivious. So was Hitler. We kept going.

<div class="line_en">My mind was racing, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Then it clicked. Hitler had a special dance move called o spana va. It means "where you work" and it was very sexual: His hips would gyrate and thrust, like he was fucking the air. That was the move he was doing at the moment the teacher ran out, so clearly the dance was the thing she found so disgusting. But this was a move that African people do all the time. It's a part of our culture. Here we were sharing our culture for a cultural day, and this woman was calling us disgusting. She was offended, and I was offended by her taking offense.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was talking, of course, about stopping the Nazis in World War II, but that's not what I was hearing. Jews in South Africa are just white people. All I was hearing was some white lady shouting about how white people beat us before and they'll beat us again. I said, "You will never stop us again, lady"-- and here's where I played the trump card --"You'll never stop us, because now we have Nelson Mandela on our side! And he told us we can do this!"</div>
