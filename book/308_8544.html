<div class="line_en">I did. King's Abbot is a mere village, but its station happens to be an important junction. Most of the big expresses stop there, and trains are shunted, re-sorted, and made up. It has two or three public telephone boxes. At that time of night, three local trains come in close upon each other, to catch the connection with the express for the north which comes in at 10.19 and leaves at 10.23. The whole place is in a bustle, and the chances of one particular person being noticed telephoning or getting into the express are very small indeed.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="梅尔罗斯上校转眼就回来了，身边跟着年轻的秘书。他将秘书介绍给波洛。杰弗里·雷蒙德和往常一样充满活力、礼貌殷勤。他似乎对能够结识波洛而感到惊喜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The secretary's reply came without a second's hesitation. "No, indeed I didn't. I don't even remember that it was in that position, but it must have been if you say so. Anyway, somebody else must have moved it back to its proper place. Have they destroyed a clue in doing so? Too bad!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话音刚落秘书就回答了，一秒钟都没耽搁。“不，绝对不是我。我甚至都没注意到它在那个位置上。但既然您这么说，肯定错不了。不管怎样，肯定是别人挪过去的。难道线索被破坏了？真糟糕！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is of no consequence," said the detective. "Of no consequence whatever. What I really want to ask you is this, M. Raymond: Did any stranger come to see Mr Ackroyd during this past week?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh! yes, I remember, but that is not the kind of stranger this gentleman means." He turned to Poirot. "Mr Ackroyd had some idea of purchasing a dictaphone," he explained. "It would have enabled us to get through a lot more work in a limited time. The firm in question sent down their representative, but nothing came of it. Mr Ackroyd did not make up his mind to purchase."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！对，我也想起来了，可他不是这位先生说的那种陌生人。”他转向波洛，“艾克罗伊德先生有意购买一台口述录音机，”他解释说，“这样我们的工作效率就可以大大提高了。出售这玩意儿的公司派了一名推销员过来洽谈，但还没成交。艾克罗伊德先生还没下决心要买。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这就非常有效地排除了家里人犯案的可能性。”警督继续说道，“接下来就是关键问题。门房的那个女人——玛丽·布莱克——昨晚拉窗帘的时候看见拉尔夫·佩顿从大门进来，朝大宅走去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“具体是什么时间？”波洛不动声色地端坐着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a silence. Then the inspector spoke again. "It's all clear enough. It fits in without a flaw. At twenty-five minutes past nine. Captain Paton is seen passing the lodge; at nine-thirty or thereabouts, Mr Geoffrey Raymond hears someone in here asking for money and Mr Ackroyd refusing. What happens next? Captain Paton leaves the same way -- through the window. He walks along the terrace, angry and baffled. He comes to the open drawing-room window. Say it's now a quarter to ten. Miss Flora Ackroyd is saying goodnight to her uncle. Major Blunt, Mr Raymond, and Mrs Ackroyd are in the billiard room. The drawing-room is empty. He steals in, takes the dagger from the silver table, and returns to the study window. He slips off his shoes, climbs in, and -- well, I don't need to go into details. Then he slips out again and goes off. Hadn't the nerve to go back to the inn. He makes for the station, rings up from there"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个人都沉默了。然后警督又开口道：“已经非常明显了，一环紧扣一环。九点二十五分有人目击佩顿上尉经过门房；九点三十分左右，杰弗里·雷蒙德先生听到有人在屋里向艾克罗伊德先生要钱，却遭到拒绝。然后呢？佩顿上尉从原路离开——从窗子出去的。他在露台上来回走着，又气又恼。他来到客厅敞开的窗户外面，假设是九点四十五分吧。弗洛拉·艾克罗伊德小姐向伯父道晚安。布兰特少校、雷蒙德先生和艾克罗伊德太太在台球室里。客厅空无一人，他趁机从银桌里取出短剑，又回到书房窗外脱掉鞋子，爬进屋里，然后——我就不描述细节了。随后他逃之夭夭，没胆量再回旅馆，而是直奔车站，在那儿打了个电话——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah! well," said the inspector, "it was a dry, fine night, you know. He left no prints on the terrace or on the gravelled path. But, unluckily for him, a spring must have welled up just lately at the end of the path from the drive. See here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，好吧，”警督说，“您也知道，昨晚的天气晴朗干燥，他没在露台和砾石小径上留下什么痕迹。然而很不巧，最近几天小径尽头的那股泉水涌了出来，溢过了路面。看这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
