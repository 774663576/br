<div class="line_en">Despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays. Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual. Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn't forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.</div>

<div class="line_en">Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid's cabin, while the Durmstrang ship's portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house-elves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about.</div>

Harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.</div>

They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneako-scope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, "Sorry, I forgot to wrap them…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是说谎，他并没有给多比买东西，但他迅速打开箱子，从里面抽出一双疙里疙瘩、卷成一团的袜子。这是他最旧最难看的一双袜子，暗黄色的，原先是弗农姨父的。这双袜子之所以这样疙里疙瘩，是因为一年多来哈利一直用它们包裹他的窥镜。现在他抽出窥镜，把袜子递给了多比，说道：“对不起，我忘记把它们包起来了…”">查看中文翻译</div>

Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry's favorites: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees.

There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs.

Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry's opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy's arm.

<div class="line_en">But she didn't look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow -- or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back. She was also smiling -- rather nervously, it was true -- but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn't understand how he hadn't spotted it before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她看上去一点儿也不像赫敏了。她对她的头发做了一些手脚，它们不再是乱蓬蓬的，而是变得柔顺而有光泽了，在脑后挽成一个高雅的发髻。她穿着一件用飘逸的浅紫光蓝色的面料做成的长袍，而且不知怎的，她的气质也不一样了——也许只是因为卸掉了她平常总挎在身上的二十多本厚书吧。她也微笑着——当然啦，有点儿紧张——但那对缩小的门牙看上去更小了。哈利真不明白他以前怎么就没有注意到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said, "See you in a minute" to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked away from them so he wouldn't have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.</div>

Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby -- he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet -- and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“说吧。”哈利催促罗恩，“巨人有什么问题？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But what's it matter if his mother was a giantess?" said Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“即便他母亲是个巨人，那又有什么要紧呢？”哈利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who cares?" Harry said. "There's nothing wrong with Hagrid!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁在乎呢？”哈利说，“海格没有哪里不好！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well… no one who knows him will care, "cos they'll know he's not dangerous," said Ron slowly. "But… Harry, they're just vicious, giants. It's like Hagrid said, it's in their natures, they're like trolls… they just like killing, everyone knows that. There aren't any left in Britain now, though."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯…认识他的人都觉得没关系，因为他们知道他没有危险性。”罗恩慢慢地说，“但是…哈利，巨人是很凶狠的。就像海格说的，这是他们的天性，他们就像巨怪一样…生来就喜欢杀人，这点大家都知道。不过，现在英国已经没有巨人了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What happened to them?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们上哪儿去了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know who Maxime thinks she's kidding," Harry said, watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges' table, looking very somber. "If Hagrid's half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones… the only thing that's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道马克西姆想骗谁。”哈利说，一边注视着马克西姆夫人独自坐在裁判桌旁，一副闷闷不乐的样子，“如果海格是混血巨人，那她肯定也是。骨架子大…比她骨架子更大的只有恐龙了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors. There're supposed to be giants abroad, though… They hide out in mountains mostly…"</div>

<div class="line_en">When the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a last, loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall. Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned, the evening hadn't been much fun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午夜十二点，古怪姐妹停止了演奏，大家最后一次对她们报以热烈掌声，然后开始朝门厅走去。许多人希望舞会能延长一些时候，可是哈利正巴不得回去睡觉呢。在他看来，这个晚上过得并不开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在舞会剩下来的时间里，哈利和罗恩一直坐在角落里谈论巨人，谁也没有心思跳舞。哈利克制着自己不去注视秋·张和塞德里克，那会使他产生踢东西的强烈冲动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出门来到门厅里，哈利和罗恩看见赫敏正在跟克鲁姆告别，然后克鲁姆就返回德姆斯特朗的船上去了。赫敏冷冷地扫了罗恩一眼，一句话没说，就与他们擦肩而过，上了大理石阶。哈利和罗恩跟在她后面，但刚上楼梯一半，哈利就听见有人喊他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole. Harry had to yell "Fairy lights!" before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you?" yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说，如果你不愿意这样，你知道怎样解决这个问题，是不是？”赫敏嚷道，她的头发已从高雅的发髻里散开，她有脸因为愤怒而扭曲了。">查看中文翻译</div>
