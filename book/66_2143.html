<div class="line_en">Josh was fussing with Petey's collar and still didn't see what was happening. I wondered if Ray was going to say anything, if he was going to do anything to stop them. But he stayed frozen and expressionless beside me.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good morning," I muttered. I was feeling very confused. A moment ago, I'd felt terribly scared. Now everyone was laughing and kidding around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早上好，”我咕哝道。我感到很困惑。刚才，我感到非常害怕。现在大家都在欢笑和开玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Several of the kids had backed up. They were standing in small groups of two and three now. The circle had completely broken up.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他今天好像不喜欢任何人，”我抱歉地告诉道斯先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawes stood back up and shrugged. "Can't win 'em all." He started back to his car, parked a few yards down the street. "I'm heading over to your house," he told Josh and me. "Just want to see if there's anything I can do to help your parents. Have fun, kids."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道斯先生站起来耸耸肩。“赢不了所有人。”他回到车旁，把车停在街上几码远的地方。“我要去你家，”他告诉乔西和我。“只是想看看我能不能帮你父母。玩得开心点，孩子们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was starting to feel a little silly. It was obvious that they hadn't been trying to scare Josh and me. I must have made the whole thing up in my mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">I must have.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一定有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The playground was completely empty. I guessed that most kids had stayed inside because of the threatening sky. The playground was a large, flat grassy field, surrounded on all four sides by a tall metal fence. There were swings and slides at the end nearest the school building. There were two baseball diamonds on the other end. Beyond the fence, I could see a row of tennis courts, also deserted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="操场上空无一人。我猜大多数孩子都呆在室内是因为天气的原因。操场是一片大而平坦的草地，四周围着一道高高的金属栅栏。在离校舍最近的一端有秋千和滑梯。另一端有两个棒球场。隔着篱笆，我可以看到一排网球场，也荒无人烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Josh tied Petey to the fence, then came running over to join the rest of us. The boy named Jerry Franklin made up the teams. Ray and I were on the same team. Josh was on the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔西把皮皮绑在篱笆上，然后跑过来和我们一起。那个叫杰瑞·富兰克林的男孩在分组。雷和我在同一队。乔西在另一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As our team took the field, I felt excited and a little nervous. I'm not the best softball player in the world. I can hit the ball pretty well. But in the field, I'm a complete klutz. Luckily, Jerry sent me out to right field where not many balls are hit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们队上场时，我感到兴奋和有点紧张。我不是世界上最好的垒球运动员。我能很好地击球。但在战场上，我是个十足的笨蛋。幸运的是，杰瑞把我送到了右边的场地，那里没有多少球被击中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="太阳出来时，我的球队开始第三局比赛。突然，我听到一声尖锐的口哨声。我环顾四周，看到是杰瑞·富兰克林，吹着一个银色的哨子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had only messed up on one play. And I hit a double my first time at bat.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="云层开始有点散开，天空变得更亮了。我们打了整整两局。另一队以8比2获胜。我玩得很开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was fun being with a whole new group of kids. They seemed really nice, especially the girl named Karen Somerset, who talked with me while we waited for our turn at bat. Karen had a great smile, even though she wore braces on all her teeth, up and down. She seemed very eager to be friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和一群新认识的孩子在一起很有趣。他们看起来真的很好，尤其是那个叫凯伦·萨默塞特的女孩，她在我们等待击球机会的时候和我说话。凯伦笑得很开心，尽管她上下牙齿都戴着牙套。她似乎很想成为我们的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all waved to each other and called out farewells, and then began to run. I couldn't believe how fast everyone left. It was as if they were racing or something.</div>
