<div class="line_en">Those who have walked across the south of France, as I have done, may have noticed an inn, situated between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, roughly half-way between the village and the town (though rather closer to Beaucaire than to Bellegarde), outside which hangs a crude painting of the Pont du Gard on a metal plate which creaks at the slightest breath of wind. This little inn, lying parallel to the course of the Rhône, is situated on the left side of the road with its back to the river. It has what in Languedoc is described as a garden: that is to say that the side opposite the one through which travellers enter overlooks an enclosure in which a few stunted olive-trees lurk beside some wild figs, their leaves silvered with dust. Between them, the only vegetables that grow here are some heads of garlic, some peppers and some shallots. Finally, in one corner, like a forgotten sentry, a tall umbrella pine rises in melancholy fashion on its pliable trunk, while its crest, fanned out, blisters under thirty degrees of sunshine. All these trees, large or small, are naturally bent in the direction of the mistral, one of the three scourges of Provence, the two others, as you may or may not know, being the River Durance and Parliament.</div>

There is a cicada perched on every one of these stalks which pursues any traveller who has strayed into this wilderness with its high-pitched, monotonous call.</div>

<div class="line_en">As if to torment still further the unfortunate innkeeper, who was ruined by it, the canal ran between the Rhône -- which supplied it with water -- and the road -- which it drained of traffic -- only some hundred yards from the inn which we have just briefly (but accurately) described.</div>

<div class="line_en">For perhaps the last seven or eight years this little inn had been kept by a man and woman whose only staff were a chambermaid called Trinette and a stableboy answering to the name of Pacaud. In fact, these two assistants had amply sufficed for the task, since a canal between Beaucaire and Aigues-Mortes had ensured the victory of water over road haulage, and barges had taken the place of the stagecoach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许在过去的七八年里，这家小客栈一向由一个男人和他的妻子共同经营，本来还有两个佣人：一个名叫德丽妮蒂，充侍女之职；另一个名叫巴卡，负责管理马厩。但是，唉！这种职务的分配实在是有名无实，因为在布揆耳和阿琪摩地之间，近来开通了一条运河，运河船代替了运货马车，花舫代替了驿车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His wife, in contrast, whose maiden name had been Madeleine Radelle, was pale, thin and sickly. She came from the region around Arles and had preserved some traces of the traditional beauty of the women of that area, while seeing her features slowly deteriorate, ravaged by one of those persistent fevers which are so common among the peoples who live near the ponds of Aigues-Mortes and the swamps of the Camargue. In consequence she spent most of her time seated, shivering, in her room on the first floor, either stretched out in an armchair or leaning against her bed, while her husband kept his customary watch at the door. He was all the more happy to spend his time there, since whenever he found himself in the same room as his better -- or certainly bitter -- half, she would harass him with unending lamentations on her fate, to which her husband would normally only respond with these philosophical words: "Quiet, La Carconte! It's God's will."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的妻子名叫做玛德兰·莱德儿，她却正巧和他相反，脸色苍白消瘦，面带病容。她出生在阿尔附近，那个地方是以出产美女闻名远近的，而她也分有了当地妇女的美丽。但那种美丽，在阿琪摩地河与凯马琪沼泽地带附近非常流行的那种慢性寒热症的摧残之下，却已逐渐萎谢了。她差不多老是呆在她二楼的房间里，哆嗦地坐在椅子里，或有气无力地躺在床上，而她的丈夫则成天地在门口守望着，——这种职务他是极其心甘情愿的，这样，他就可以不必听他的伴侣在他的耳边咕噜那说不尽的怨语，因为她每一见他，就必定滔滔不绝地痛骂命运，诅咒她现在这种不该受的苦境。对于这一切，她的丈夫总是不变地用这些富于哲学意味的话平心静气地回答：“别说了，卡康脱人，这些事都是上帝安排的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The innkeeper was a man of forty to forty-five, tall, dry, nervous, a typical Southerner with his deep-set, shining eyes, his hooked nose and his teeth as white as those of some beast of prey. Though his hair had felt the first breath of age, it could not make up its mind to go grey: like the beard that he wore following the line of his jaw, it was thick, curly and spattered with just a few strands of white. His complexion, naturally swarthy, was covered by yet a new layer of brown from the habit he had adopted of standing from morning to night on the threshold of his door to see if some customer might not arrive, either on foot or by carriage. His expectations were almost invariably disappointed; but he stood there still, with no protection against the burning heat of the sun other than a red handkerchief knotted about his head, like a Spanish mule-driver. This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard Caderousse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客栈老板是一个年约四十至四十五岁的人，身材高大强壮，骨胳粗大，实是法国南部人的一个好标本。他有闪闪发光而深陷的黑眼睛，弯曲的鼻子和象一只食肉兽那样雪白的牙齿。他的头发，虽然经过时间的吹拂，却似乎不愿变白，象他那蓄在颔下的胡须一样，茂密而卷曲，但已略微混入了几根银丝。他的肤色天生是黯黑的，加之这个可怜虫又有一种习惯，喜欢自朝到晚地站在他的门口，切望有一个骑马或徒步来的旅客或许会造福他的眼睛，使他得到又一次看见客人进门的喜悦，所以在黑色之外，又加上了一层棕褐色。他的耐心和他的期望都一样的得不到结果，可是他还是日复一日地在那儿站着，暴露在象火一样猛晒的太阳之下，头上除了象西班牙骡夫似的缠着一块红色的手帕以外，别无其他保护之物。这个人就是我们以前认识的卡德罗斯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The nickname derived from the fact that Madeleine Radelle had been born in the village of La Carconte, between Sallon and Lambesc. So, in accordance with local custom, by which people are almost always given a nickname in place of their names, her husband had substituted this for Madeleine, which was probably too soft and pleasant sounding for his rough tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡康脱人这个绰号之所以会赐给玛德兰·莱德儿，是因为她出生的村庄位于萨隆和兰比克之间，那个村庄就叫这个名字。而据卡德罗斯所住的那一带法国地方的风俗，人们常常给每一个人起一个独特而明晰的称呼，她的丈夫所以要赐她卡康脱人这个名字，或许是因为玛德兰这三字太婉转悦耳了，他那粗笨的舌头说不惯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, it should not be thought that the innkeeper, despite this pretence of resignation to the decrees of fate, was not acutely sensible of the poverty to which he had been reduced by the confounded Beaucaire canal, or that he was proof against the endless complaints that his wife heaped on him. Like all Southerners, he was moderate, needing little for himself, but vain when it came to external matters; so, in the days of his prosperity, he would not let a ferrade or a procession of the tarasque go past without appearing in it, La Carconte at his side: he would be dressed in the picturesque costume of a man from the Midi, somewhere between Catalan and Andalusian dress, while she would have on the delightful attire of the women of Arles, suggestive of Greece and Arabia. Little by little, however, watch-chains, necklaces, gaudy belts, embroidered blouses, velvet jackets, elegantly trimmed stockings, multicoloured gaiters and silver-buckled shoes had vanished, until Gaspard Caderousse could no longer appear in his former splendour; so, on his own behalf and that of his wife, he gave up all these worldly exhibitions, though he felt a bitter pang when the happy sounds of some celebration would reach this miserable inn, which he kept much more to have a roof over his head than as a business proposition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，他虽然假装出这种听天由命的态度，我们却不能骤下断语，以为这位不幸的客栈老板并不明白那可恶的布揆耳运河给他带来的痛苦，或以为他永远不会为他妻子喋喋不休的抱怨所打动，不因眼看那条可恨的运河带走了他的顾客和利润，以致他那脾气乖戾的伴侣越益抱怨噜苏，使自己陷入于双重痛苦而恼怒。象其他的南部居民一样，他也是一个老成持重，欲望不高的人，但却爱好浮夸和虚荣，极喜欢出风头。在他境况顺利的那些日子里，每逢节日，国庆，或举行典礼的时候，在凑热闹的观众之中，总不会没有他和他的妻子的。他穿起法国南部居民逢到这种大场面时所穿的那种漂亮的服装，就是象迦太兰人和安达露西亚人所穿的那种服式；而卡康脱人则炫耀出那种在阿尔妇女中流行的美丽时装，就是一种从希腊和阿拉伯摹仿来的服式。但渐渐地，表链呀，项圈呀，花色领巾呀，绣花乳褡呀，丝绒背心呀，做工精美的袜子呀，条纹扎脚套呀，以及鞋子上的银搭扣呀，都不见了，于是，葛司柏·卡德罗斯，既不能穿着以前的华服出外露面，就和他的妻子都不再参加这些浮华虚荣的场面，虽然当那些兴高采烈的欢呼者所发出的高兴的声音和愉快的音乐传到这个可怜的客栈的时候，——而这个他现在还依恋着的客栈只能算是一个庇身之所，谈不上赚钱，——他的脑子里也未尝不充满着嫉妒和不满的痛苦之感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, if he had remained at his post, Caderousse would have seen, defying probability, a horse and rider approaching from Bellegarde with that frank and friendly manner which suggests the best possible understanding between the horseman and his mount. The horse was a gelding which ambled pleasantly along; on its back was a priest, dressed in black and wearing a three-cornered hat, despite the blistering heat of the sun which was now at its zenith. The pair proceeded at a very sensible trot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，假如卡德罗斯在他的门前多留几分钟的话，他大概可以看到一个模糊的轮廓从比里加答那个方向过来。当那个移动的目标走近的时候，他就很容易看出，来者原来是一人一马，两者之间，看来似乎有着最和蔼可亲的谅解。那匹马是匈牙利种的，一路踏着那种马所特具的安闲的快步跑来。它的骑者是一位教士，穿着一身黑衣服，戴着一顶三角帽，虽然中午的阳光很灼热，那一对人和马却以相当快的步子跑来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As was his custom, Caderousse had spent part of the morning standing at the door, turning his sad eyes from a little bare patch of grass where some hens were pecking, to each end of the empty road which extended southwards in one direction, northwards in the other. Suddenly his wife's sour voice called him away from his post. He went inside, grumbling, and up to the first floor, while leaving the door wide open as if to persuade travellers not to forget him as they went by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天，卡德罗斯照常站在他门前的了望地位上，他时而无精打采地望望一片几乎光秃秃的草地，时而望望道路，草地上有几只家禽在那儿啄食，努力地想寻觅一些合它们胃口的谷物或昆虫，但一无结果，自南至北的道路上，寂无一人。他的心里正在盘算着，幻想着会不会碰巧有一个客人进来，使邦杜加客栈得以尽它招待客商的职守，忽然听得他的妻子尖声叫唤，喊他赶快到她那儿。他口里低声地噜苏着，很不高兴他的妻子打断他的思想，脚下却向她楼上的房间走去，——但是，在上楼以前，他把前门大开，象是请旅客在经过的时候不要忘记它似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Caderousse turned back into the house, the main road down which, as we said, he had been looking, was as empty and lonely as a desert under the midday sun. White and endless, it ran between two lines of slender trees and it was quite reasonable to suppose that no traveller who was free to choose any other hour of the day would wish to venture into this awful Sahara.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当卡德罗斯离开他门前的时候，那条他极目凝视的道路，象中午的沙漠一样空旷和孤寂。它直挺挺地躺在那儿，象是一条无尽头的灰和沙所组成的线，两旁排列着高大而瘦瘠的树，看来绝无动人之处，凡是头脑清醒的人，谁都不能想象会有任何可以自由支配旅程的旅客竟会选择在这烈日当空的时候，让自己暴露到这个可怕的撒哈拉沙漠来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they reached the door, they stopped: it would have been difficult to decide whether it was the horse that stopped the man or the man who stopped the horse. In any event, the rider dismounted and, leading the horse by its bridle, attached it to the knob of a dilapidated shutter that was hanging by a single hinge. The priest then went across to the door, wiping his dripping brow with a red cotton handkerchief, and knocked three times with the iron tip of his cane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到邦杜加客栈前面，那匹马停了下来，但究竟是它自己要停的还是它的骑者要停却很难说。但不论是谁要停的，总之，那位教士从马上下来，牵住他那匹骏马的辔头，想找一个地方把它系上。他利用从一扇半倒的门上突出来的门闩，把马安全地系了起来，慈爱地拍拍它，从口袋里抽出一条红色的棉纱手帕，抹一抹从他的额头流下来的汗珠，然后走到门前，用他的铁头手杖的一端敲了三下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Indeed I do."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, Monsieur," said Caderousse, "it's not that either Mercédès the Catalan or Monsieur Morrel abandoned him, but the poor old man had taken a profound antipathy to Fernand, the very person," he added, smiling ironically, "that Dantès told you was one of his friends."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他倒并没有完全被人舍弃，”卡德罗斯答道，“因为那个迦太兰人美茜蒂丝和摩莱尔先生待他都非常好，但那个可怜的老人不知怎么极其厌恶弗南，——那个人，”卡德罗斯带着一个苦笑又说，“就是您刚才称为邓蒂斯的忠实而亲爱的朋友之一的那个家伙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gaspard, Gaspard!" the woman muttered from the top of the stairs. "Mind what you say!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“葛司柏！葛司柏！”坐在楼梯上的妇人低声埋怨地说，“想想你在说什么话！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caderousse made an impatient gesture and, with no other reply to the woman who had interrupted him, told the abbé: "Can anyone be the friend of a man whose wife he covets? Dantès, who had a heart of gold, called all those people his friends… Poor Edmond! After all, it is better that he knew nothing, he would have found it too hard to forgive them on his deathbed. Whatever anyone says," Caderousse concluded, with a kind of rough poetry in his speech, "I am still more afraid of a dead man's curse than of a living man's hatred."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡德罗斯虽然分明很不高兴他的话被打断，但却不予答复，只是对长老说，“一个人想把别人的老婆夺为己有，还能称为对他忠实吗？邓蒂斯，他有一颗黄金似的心，只要人家自称和他要好，他就会相信。可怜的爱德蒙！但他幸而始终不曾发觉，否则，在临终的时候要宽恕他们，就太难了。而不管旁人怎么说，”卡德罗斯用他那种充满庸俗的诗意的乡谈继续说，“我却总觉得死人的诅咒比活人的仇恨更可怕些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you know what Fernand did to harm Dantès, then?" asked the abbé.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末，您知道弗南是怎么害邓蒂斯的吗？”长老问卡德罗斯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Apart from which, those people could crush you with a flick of the hand," said his wife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你倒不想想看，”妇人说，“那两个人只要动一动，就可以把你压得粉碎。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So, you want me to give these people, who you tell me are unworthy and false friends, a gift that was meant to reward their fidelity?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末您愿意，”长老说，“我把那本来预备用来报答忠实的友谊的东西，赐给你所说的那些虚伪和奸恶的人吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gaspard, you can do as you wish, you are the master here," said his wife. "But if you take my advice, you'll say nothing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“葛司柏！”卡康脱人大声说，“随你的便，——你是家主，但假如你听我作主，你对于这件事就不要说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's true, you're right," said Caderousse. "In any case, what would poor Edmond's bequest be to them now? A drop of water in the ocean."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这句话的确不错，”卡德罗斯答道。“您说得对，而且可怜的爱德蒙的遗产，现在对于他们还算得了什么呢？——不过是沧海之一粟而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is the use? If the lad was alive and if he came to me to tell him, once and for all, who were his friends and who his enemies, then I might do it. But he is dead and gone, so you say; he can feel hatred no longer, nor can he take revenge. Let's draw the blind on all this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，讲出来又有什么用呢？”卡德罗斯问。“假如那个可怜的孩子还活着，亲自来求我，我就会坦白地告诉他，谁是他的真朋友，谁是他的假朋友，那时或许我倒不会犹豫。但您告诉我，他已经不在了，他已不再能怀恨或复仇的了，所以还是让这一切善善恶恶都与他一起埋葬了吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come and see it, wife!" the innkeeper said, his voice breaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老婆，老婆！”他喊道，他的声音被紧张的情绪几乎弄得嘶哑了，“到这儿来看看这粒值钱的钻石呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A diamond!" said La Carconte, getting up and walking quite resolutely down the stairs. "What is this diamond then?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“钻石！”卡康脱人一面喊，一面站起身来，用一种相当坚定的步伐下到房间里来，“你说的是什么钻石？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are quite at liberty to keep it to yourself," the abbé said, with an air of the most profound indifference. "If so, I shall respect any reservations you may have. Indeed, you are showing yourself to be a truly generous man, so let's say no more about it. The duty that I have to carry out is a mere formality: I shall sell the diamond." He took it out of his pocket, opened the box and displayed the shining stone before Caderousse's eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，我的好朋友，”长老回答说，语气间表示这件事和他绝无关系，“说不说是您的自由，尽可随便。我尊敬您的隐恶扬善，钦佩您的多情，这件事就算了吧。我只能凭良心尽我的责任，履行我对一个临终的人所许的诺言。我的第一件任务是处置这粒钻石。”说着，长老又从他的口袋里摸出那只小盒子，打开盒子，故意拿成这样的一种角度，以致那灿烂的光芒直射到卡德罗斯的眼前，使他看得眼花缭乱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Didn't you hear? It's a diamond that the boy left us: first of all to his father, then to his three friends: Fernand, Danglars and myself, and to his wife Mercédès. It's worth fifty thousand francs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咦，我们说的话你难道没有听到吗？”卡德罗斯问。“这粒钻石是可怜的爱德蒙·邓蒂斯遗留下来的，要把它卖了，把钱分给他的爹爹，他的未婚妻美茜蒂丝，弗南，邓格拉司和我。这粒钻石至少要值五万法郎呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caderousse seemed to reflect for a short time. Then he said: "No, in fact the story is too long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡德罗斯想了一想，然后说，“不，真的，说来话可太长了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So, one-fifth of the amount belongs to us?" Caderousse asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末，这粒钻石所卖得的钱，五份之一是属于我们的了，是不是？”卡德罗斯问，一面仍用他的眼睛贪婪地凝视着那闪闪发光的钻石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Traitors are not friends," the woman muttered grimly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那些出卖你，使你倾家荡产的人，我是不把他们叫做朋友的。”做妻子的用一种自言自语的口吻低声说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“因为你们是爱德蒙的四个朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's what you wanted," the abbé continued calmly, putting the diamond back into his cassock pocket. "Now, give me the address of Edmond's friends, so that I can carry out his last wishes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要记得，”长老一面回答，一面把宝石连盒子都藏进他的法衣口袋里，“假如我这样做，这可是您的错，不关我事。请您告诉我爱德蒙那几位朋友的地址，以便我执行他临终时的愿望。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But why among four?" asked La Carconte.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而为什么要分给我们四个人呢？”卡德罗斯问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这粒漂亮的钻石可能完全给我们。”卡德罗斯说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As you wish. I am having nothing to do with it." She returned, shivering, to the staircase. Her teeth were chattering, despite the burning heat of the day. On the top step she paused and said: "Think about it, Gaspard!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”卡康脱人回答说，“你爱怎么就怎么吧。至于我，这件事我可洗手不管。”说着，她重新爬上那座通到她的房间去的楼梯，浑身痛苦地寒颤着，牙齿格格地互相交战——虽然天气是非常的热，走到楼梯顶上以后，她回过头来，用一种警告的口吻对她的丈夫大声说，“葛司柏，你可要想清楚了再做呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you think so?" his wife replied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你相信吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sweat was pouring down Caderousse's forehead. He saw the abbé get up and go towards the door, as if to make sure that his horse was waiting, before coming back. Caderousse and his wife exchanged an indescribable look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡德罗斯真是激动到极点了，大滴汗珠从他那火热的额头上滚下来。当他看到长老站起身来，走向门口，象是去看看他的马究竟有没有恢复精力使他能够继续上路的时候，卡德罗斯和他的老婆互相交换了一个含有深意的眼色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, just so," said Caderousse. "I was only saying as much. It's almost blasphemy, almost sacrilegious to reward treachery, or even crime."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不，”卡德罗斯立刻接上来说，“我也不会。我刚才对这位先生所说的就是这一点，我说，我认为以德来报答那些奸恶，或许甚至有罪的人，是一种污渎神灵的行为。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, Monsieur. Plus Dantès' father's share, which I feel I have the right to divide among the four of you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”长老答道，“另外还有本来预备给老邓蒂斯的那一份，我想，我可以自由作主，平均分配给还活着的四个人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">La Carconte went back to her room with a sigh. The ceiling creaked under her feet until she reached her armchair and let herself fall heavily into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡康脱人于是走进她的房间，当她脚步踉跄地向她的圈椅走去的时候，她房间的地板吱吱格格地叫起来，她倒在圈椅里，象是已精疲力尽了似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite honestly, I think that's best," said the priest. "Not that I want to know anything that you want to hide from me; but if you can help me to distribute the bequest in accordance with the wishes of the departed, that will be best."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为您这样做是很聪明的，”教士说。“倒不是因为我想知道您想对我掩饰的事，我可丝毫没有这种意思，只是因为假如您能帮助我可以依照遗言人的愿望来分配遗产，嗯，那就好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，那末，请您开始吧，”长老说，“我等着呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"One moment," said Caderousse. "We might be interrupted at the most interesting point, which would be a pity. In any case, it's better that no one knows you have been here." He went across to the door of the inn and closed it, putting the bolt across it as an extra precaution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等一下，”卡德罗斯答道，“说不定当我说到最有趣的那部分的时候会有人来打扰我们，那就太可惜了。而且您这次光临，应该只有我们自己知道才好。”他一面说这些话，一面轻手轻脚地走到门口，把门关了，为了更加小心起见，并把门闩闩上，象他每天晚上所做的一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile the abbé had chosen a place from which he could listen in comfort. He was sitting in a corner, in such a way as to be in shadow, while the light fell full on the face of whoever was opposite him. His head bowed, his hands folded -- or, rather, clasped together -- he prepared to give all his attention to the story. Caderousse drew up a stool and sat down opposite the abbé.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，长老选了一个可以舒舒服服地听讲的地位。他把他的座位搬到房间的一个角落里，在那儿，他自己躲在浓厚的阴影里，而光线却可全部照射到讲话人的身上，于是，他低了头，握着手，或更正确地说，是把双手紧绞在一起，以备全神贯注地倾听卡德罗斯说，卡德罗斯则坐在他对面的一张小矮凳上。">查看中文翻译</div>
