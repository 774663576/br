Though Cheng Xin had attracted notice with her intelligence and seemed to shine brighter than Vadimov -- despite the fact that she was supposed to be his aide -- he had never shown any jealousy. He had always encouraged her to display her brilliance on bigger and bigger stages.</div>

<div class="line_en">She consulted medical specialists and learned that it was possible to intentionally induce leukemia. All you had to do was to place the victim in an environment with sufficient radiation. But getting the timing and dosage right was no trivial matter. Too little would not induce the illness in time, but too much would kill the victim with radiation sickness, possibly damaging the brain. Timing-wise, based on the advanced state of Vadimov's illness, the scheme against him would have to have begun right around the time the PDC started to promote euthanasia laws around the world. If there was a killer, he was extremely skilled.</div>

It was just after the start of their first semester in college, and all the aerospace engineering students took turns introducing themselves. She saw Tianming sitting by himself in a corner.

<div class="line_en">Wade's comment stunned Cheng Xin and chilled her heart.

The experience was intended to simulate the conditions of a brain existing independent of the body. Then the examiners assessed the candidate's psychological ability to adapt to alien conditions. Of course, since the test designers knew nothing about conditions within the Trisolaran Fleet, they had to fill out their simulation with guesses. Overall, the test was quite harsh.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no real reason to send Cheng Xin to the future anymore, but the PIA still asked her to enter suspended animation. Her mission now was to act as a liaison to the Staircase Program in the future. If this pioneering effort was to be helpful to humanity's spaceflight efforts in two centuries, someone who understood it deeply had to be there to explain the dead data and interpret the mute documents. Of course, perhaps the real reason for sending her was only one of vanity, a wish that the Staircase Program would not be forgotten by the future. Other large contemporary engineering projects had made similar efforts to send liaisons to the future for similar reasons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心本来已经没有理由去未来了，她似乎要继续被阶梯计划完全改变了的人生，但PIA仍然让她冬眠。她的使命变成了阶梯计划的未来联络员；设想这项计划如果能对两个世纪后的人类宇航有帮助，就需要一个全面了解它的人，而不仅仅是死的资料。其实，派她去的真正目的，可能只是希望阶梯计创不被末来所遗忘或误解。这一时期，还有一些其他的大型工程项目向未来派去联络员，目的也一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was when the accident occurred. Analysis of the frequency spectrum of the light reflected from the radiation sail showed that the sail had begun to curl, possibly because one of the towing cables had broken. However, the 998th nuclear bomb detonated before adjustments could be made, and the craft deviated from the projected course. As the sail continued to curl, its radar profile rapidly shrank, and it disappeared from the monitoring system. Without precise parameters for its trajectory, it would never be found again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但故障就在这时出现了。监测系统通过巨帆反射光的频谱分析发现，帆开始卷曲，据推测最大的可能是一根帆索断了。但第九百九十八枚核弹仍被引爆，只剩下三根帆索的帆此时得到了一个错误的速度分量，偏离了预定航线。帆继续卷曲，雷达反射面急剧缩小，监测系统丢失了它，也丢失了它的轨道参数，人类不可能再找到它了。">查看中文翻译</div>
