<div class="line_en">It was the cloud animals that saved the Chosen One when the shadows came in secret to the kingdom of Mimovas to kidnap him. For while Miamas is made of fantasy, Mimovas is made of love. Without love there is no music, and without music there is no Mimovas, and the Chosen One was the most beloved in the whole kingdom. So if the shadows had taken him, it would eventually have led to the downfall of the Land-of-Almost-Awake. If Mimovas falls then Mirevas falls, and if Mirevas falls then Miamas falls, and if Miamas falls then Miaudacas falls, and if Miaudacas falls then Miploris falls. Because without music there can't be any dreams, and without dreams there can't be any fairy tales, and without fairy tales there can't be any courage, and without courage no one would be able to bear any sorrows, and without music and dreams and fairy tales and courage and sorrow there would only be one kingdom left in the Land-of-Almost-Awake: Mibatalos. But Mibatalos can't live alone, because the warriors there would be worthless without the other kingdoms, because they'd no longer have anything to fight for.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mum, of course, was very angry at Granny about the whole plastic tree thing, because she likes the smell of a real spruce tree and always said that the plastic tree was something Granny had duped Elsa about. Because it was Granny who had told Elsa about the Christmas tree dance in Miamas, and no one who's heard that story wants to have a spruce tree that someone has amputated and sold into slavery. In Miamas, spruce trees are living, thinking creatures with -- considering that they're coniferous trees -- an unaccountably strong interest in home design.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈当然因为塑料树的事很生外婆的气，她喜欢真正的云杉的气味，总说塑料树是外婆哄骗爱莎的后果。因为外婆给爱莎讲了密阿玛斯圣诞树舞蹈的故事，而听过那故事的每个人都不会再想要一棵被人锯下并当作奴隶售卖的云杉树。在密阿玛斯，云杉树是有生命、会思考的物种——考虑到它们是松类——对家庭装饰有着不可理解的强烈兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They don't live in the forest but in the southern districts of Miamas, which have become quite trendy in recent years, and they often work in the advertising industry and wear scarves indoors. And once every year, soon after the first snow has fallen, all the spruce trees gather in the big square below the castle and compete for the right to stay in someone's house over Christmas. The spruce trees choose the houses, not the other way round, and the choice is decided by a dance competition. In the olden days they used to have duels about it, but spruce trees are generally such bad shots that it used to take forever. So now they do spruce dancing, which looks a bit unusual, because spruce trees don't have feet. And if a non-spruce tree wants to imitate a dancing spruce tree, they just jump up and down. It's quite handy, particularly on a crowded dance floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它们不住在森林里，而是住在密阿玛斯的南部——近几年那里变得很现代，它们常在广告行业工作，在室内也喜欢戴着围巾。每年第一场雪降下之后，所有的云杉就会在城堡下的大广场集合，为了去别人的房子里过圣诞的权利而竞争。是云杉选择房子，而不是反过来。选择由一场舞蹈大赛决定，过去是跳双人舞，但云杉通常跳得很糟糕，总是要好久才能决出胜负。于是它们现在改跳云杉舞，这种舞看上去很特别，因为云杉树没有脚。如果其他人想模仿一棵跳舞的云杉树，他们只要上下跳就可以了。这招很实用，特别是在拥挤的舞池里。">查看中文翻译</div>

She brought it down a bucket of cinnamon buns from Maud and told it to hide under the blankets in the backseat if anyone came down into the garage. "You have to pretend you're a pile of clothes or a TV or something!" suggested Elsa, though the wurse didn't look entirely convinced. So Elsa had to go and get a sack of dreams from Maud, after which the wurse gave in and crept under the blankets. It didn't look much like a TV, though.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kent asks Klaus to hold the line, as you do when there is actually no Klaus at all on the line. He is wearing a rugby shirt with numbers and a little man on a horse on his chest. Kent has told Elsa that this sort of shirt costs more than a thousand kronor, and Granny always used to say that those sorts of shirts were a good thing, because the horse functioned as a sort of manufacturer's warning that the shirt was highly likely to be transporting a muppet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their door is locked and shut today. All the other doors too. Anyone who's awake has left the house; everyone else is still asleep. So Elsa hears Kent's voice several floors up, even though he's whispering, because that's how the acoustics of stairwells work. Elsa knows that because "acoustics" is a word for the word jar. She hears Kent whispering, "Yes, I promise I'll be back tonight." But when he comes down the last flight of stairs, past the wurse's and Wolfheart's flats and the boy and the mother's flat, Kent suddenly starts talking in a loud voice and calling out, "Yes, Klaus! In Frankfurt! Yez, yez, yez!" And then he turns around and pretends that he's only just noticed Elsa standing behind him.</div>

We can't have wild animals roving around the building -- it reduces the value of the leasehold conversion, you see?" He smiles condescendingly; she can see that he's glancing insecurely at his telephone. "It's not like we're going to kill it! It'll just go to sleep for a bit, okay?

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie meets her eyes, and for a single fleeting second there's some humanity in them. Elsa can see that. But then Kent's voice can be heard, calling to Britt-Marie from the stairwell that she has to bring more poison, and then the normal Britt-Marie is back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽看着爱莎的眼睛，那一秒她的眼睛里透露出一些仁慈，爱莎能看出来。但随后肯特的声音响起，在楼梯间冲布里特—玛丽说，她得再拿些毒药，然后平时的布里特—玛丽就回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You mustn't let Kent kill it," pleads Elsa, wide-eyed. "Please, Britt-Marie, it's my friend…"</div>

<div class="line_en">She has been banging on the door for more than a minute before she hears Alf's dragging footsteps. He opens it with a cup of coffee in his hand that smells so strong that she's sure a spoon would get stuck in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她足足敲了超过一分钟的门，才听见阿尔夫拖着地板的脚步声。他打开门，手里端着一杯咖啡，咖啡浓得都快成糊状了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa hasn't even had time to explain what's in Renault's backseat before Alf has put down the coffee cup, stepped into his shoes, and set off down the stairs. She hears Alf and Kent roaring at each other so terribly that she has to cover her ears. She can't hear what they're saying, except that it's a lot of swearwords, and Kent shouts something about leaseholds and how one can't have "rust-heaps" parked in the garage because then people will think the house is full of "socialists." Which is Kent's way of saying "bloody idiots," Elsa understands. And then Alf shouts, "Bloody idiot," which is his way of saying exactly that, because Alf is not big on complicating things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎还没来得及解释雷诺的后座上有什么，阿尔夫就已经放下咖啡杯，穿上鞋，走下楼梯。她听见阿尔夫和肯特互相冲着对方怒吼，内容可怕得让她不得不捂上耳朵。她听不清他们在说什么，除了一堆脏话，肯特吼着什么租赁所有权，什么“破烂玩意儿”不能停在车库，因为那样人们会觉得房子里都是无业游民。那是肯特说“该死的蠢货”的方式，爱莎知道。然后阿尔夫怒吼“该死的蠢货”，那是他表达的方式，因为阿尔夫不喜欢把事情搞得太复杂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty minutes later they're standing in a scrapyard outside the city, and Elsa is hugging the hood of Renault in the exact same way you hug a cloud animal: with your whole body. She can see that the TV in the backseat is shuffling about, fairly displeased about not being the first to be hugged, but if you're almost eight and forget to hug a wurse in a Renault, it's because you're less worried about the wurse than the poor scrapyard worker who happens to find it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二十分钟之后，他们站在城外的一个废品堆放场里，爱莎抱着雷诺的引擎盖，正如抱着一头云兽：用整个身体。她看见后座的电视机在挪动，对于自己没有被第一个拥抱十分不满。如果你即将八岁，忘记拥抱一只在雷诺里的呜嘶，那是因为比起呜嘶，你更担心不小心发现它的可怜的废品场工人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How do we find out where Kent sent it, then?" asks Elsa, at the same time that Dad does his best not to look completely tentative.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alf ensures that Renault is parked in Granny's slot in the garage, not in Britt-Marie's. When Elsa introduces them to each other, Dad stares at the wurse with the expression of someone preparing for a root canal. The wurse glares back, a bit cocky. Too cocky, thinks Elsa, so she hauls it over the coals about whether it ate the scrapyard foreman's moped. Whereupon the wurse stops looking cocky and goes to lie down under the blankets and looks a bit as if it's thinking that if people don't want it to eat mopeds, then people should be more generous with the cinnamon buns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔夫确认雷诺停在了车库里外婆的车位上，而不是布里特—玛丽的。爱莎介绍他们认识时，爸爸盯着呜嘶，表情就像他马上要接受根管治疗。呜嘶回应着他的注视，带着点儿狂妄。爱莎觉得那有点儿太狂妄了，所以质问它是不是吃了废品场领班的外卖。于是呜嘶不再扬扬得意，缩进毯子下面，看上去像是在琢磨，如果人们不想它吃外卖，那就应该更加大方地给它肉桂卷的嘛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She tells Dad, to his immense relief, that he can go and wait in Audi. Then Elsa and Alf gather all the red food bowls from the stairwell and put them in a big black trash bag. Kent catches them and fumes that the poison bloody cost him six hundred kronor. Britt-Marie just stands there.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Elsa goes with Dad to buy a plastic tree. Because Britt-Marie is wrong, Elsa's family are no barbarians.
