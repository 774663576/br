<div class="line_en">The world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying --</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“蹲下！”哈利大喊，又一批咒语从夜空飞来。他和罗恩同时抓住赫敏把她拖倒在地，可是珀西伏在弗雷德的遗体上，挡住弟弟不让他再受伤害。哈利嚷道：“珀西，走吧，我们必须离开！”但珀西只是摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把赫敏推上前，让她和罗恩一起走，自己俯身拽住弗雷德的胳肢窝。珀西明白了哈利的意图，便不再紧贴在遗体上，也出手相助。他们猫着腰躲避着从操场上射来的魔咒，一起拖着弗雷德离开了危险地带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It brought friends!" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它带来了同伙！”哈利大声对其他人说。他透过墙上就咒语炸出的窟窿朝城堡外望去，又有许多巨蜘蛛从墙壁外侧爬了上来。一定是食死徒闯入禁林，把它们放了出来。哈利朝它们连连发射昏迷咒，领头的蜘蛛被打倒了，摔在它的同伙身上，它们一起翻滚着掉下城堡，消失了。接着，又有咒语从哈利头顶上掠过，离得真近哪，他感到魔咒的力量把他的头发都吹动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here," said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bulllike roar: "ROOKWOOD!" and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这儿。”哈利说，他们把弗雷德放在本来有一套铠甲的壁龛里。哈利不敢再多看弗雷德一眼，确保遗体藏好以后，他便跟着罗恩和赫敏跑开了。马尔福和高尔不见了，走廊上灰尘弥漫，散落着被击碎的石块，窗户上的玻璃早就没有了。哈利看见走廊尽头有许多人奔来奔去，不知是敌是友。转过一个弯，珀西像公牛一样大吼一声：“卢克伍德！”就冲一个正在追赶两个学生的高个子男巫奔了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort's thoughts?

<div class="line_en">He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp.</div>

The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great "Wheeeeeeeeeeee!" and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="接着，他听见从前面的房间里传来的说话的声音，但隧道尽头的豁口被一个旧箱子似的东西堵住了，使说话声听上去有点发闷。哈利尽量屏住呼吸，一点点地挪到豁口处，透过箱子和洞壁间的狭小缝隙望过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那边的屋子里光线昏暗，但他还是看见了纳吉尼。大蛇安全地待在那个飘浮在半空的星光闪闪的魔法保护球里，像在水底下一样扭动、盘绕。哈利还看见一张桌子的边缘，有一只苍白的、手指修长的手在摆弄一根魔杖。接着，斯内普说话了，哈利的心猛地一跳。斯内普跟哈利蜷身躲藏的地方只有几寸。">查看中文翻译</div>
