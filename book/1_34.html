The fact is, I have been to visit a well-known Gypsy family which many, many years ago sold a magic brass mirror to Great-grandmother. I have also gotten myself a crystal ball.

As soon as the plane is in flight, you can lower the seat back and give yourself a well-earned rest. You will need to be rested when you get home.
