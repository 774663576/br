<div class="line_en">As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years' free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione's increasing resentment, Harry's best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在要求他们使用无声咒了，不仅黑魔法防御术课，而且魔咒课和变形课也这样要求。哈利在公共休息室或者在吃饭的时候，经常看见他的同班同学脸憋得通红，暗暗跟自己较着劲儿，像是服用了过量的便秘仁。但他知道，他们实际上是在苦苦练习不把咒语念出声来而让魔法生效的本领。只有来到外面的暖房里时，大家才算松了口气。现在草药课上对付的植物比过去更危险了，但是当曼德拉草的毒触手猝不及防地从后面抓住他们时，他们至少还可以大声地念咒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We've got Quidditch tryouts this morning!" said Ron. "And we're supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今天上午有魁地奇选拔赛呢！”罗恩说，“而且还要练习弗立维布置的清水如泉咒！再说了，有什么可解释的？我们总不能跟他说我们讨厌他那门愚蠢的课程吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于功课繁重，没日没夜地练习无声咒，哈利、罗恩和赫敏一直没能有时间去看望海格。海格已经不来教工餐桌吃饭了，这是一个不祥的兆头，而且有几次他们在走廊里或外面操场上遇到他，他竟然假装没看见他们，也没听见他们跟他打招呼，这真是太奇怪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Speak for yourself, I haven't forgotten the skrewts," said Ron darkly. "And I'm telling you now, we've had a narrow escape. You didn't hear him going on about his gormless brother -- we'd have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we'd stayed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是你自己这么说，我可没忘记那些炸尾螺。”罗恩愁眉苦脸地说，“现在我告诉你吧，我们能逃脱真是够侥幸的。你没听见他怎么谈他那个傻瓜弟弟——如果我们留下来继续上课，现在可能在教格洛普怎么系鞋带呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I hate not talking to Hagrid," said Hermione, looking upset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不愿意跟海格不说话。”赫敏说，显得很难过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We'll go down after Quidditch," Harry assured her. He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives. "But trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied." He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. "I dunno why the team's this popular all of a sudden."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我们就等魁地奇选拔赛结束以后再去。”哈利安慰她道。他也很想念海格，不过他和罗恩一样，也觉得最好一辈子别跟格洛普打交道。“有这么多人提出申请，选拔赛可能要进行一个上午呢。”想到就要面对他当队长后的第一个障碍，他感到有点儿紧张。“不知道为什么球队突然变得这么受欢迎了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, come on, Harry," said Hermione, suddenly impatient. "It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，得了吧，哈利，”赫敏突然不耐烦起来，说道，“受欢迎的不是魁地奇，而是你！你从来没像现在这样让人感兴趣过，坦白地说吧，你从来没像现在这样招人喜欢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Everyone knows you've been telling the truth now, don't they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they're calling you 'the Chosen One' -- well, come on, can't you see why people are fascinated by you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在大家都知道你说的是实话了，对不对？整个巫师界都不得不承认，你说的伏地魔卷土重来的消息是正确的，而且你在过去两年里真的跟他较量过两次，两次都死里逃生。现在他们管你叫‘救世之星’——怎么样，现在你还不明白人们为什么对你着迷吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在部里那些家伙抓我时留下的痕迹，现在也能看得出来，你看。”罗恩说着把衣袖往上抖了抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有啊，你遭受了魔法部对你的那些迫害，他们拼命想把你说成是一个反复无常的人，一个说谎专家。那个恶毒的女人逼你用自己的鲜血写出的印迹，现在还能看得出来，可是你仍然坚持自己的说法……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either," Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有，你暑假里长高了差不多一英寸，这也让人刮目相看。”赫敏没有理睬罗恩，兀自把话说下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我个子也高了。”罗恩没头没脑地来了这么一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="送信的猫头鹰来了，俯冲着穿过溅满雨水的窗户，把雨滴洒在礼堂里每个人的头上和身上。大多数人的邮件都比平常多。忧心忡忡的家长都急着想知道自己孩子的消息，反过来又告诉孩子他们在家一切都好。哈利自从开学以来就没有收到过信。惟一一个经常给他写信的人已经死了，他曾暗暗希望卢平偶尔会给他写写信，但这个期盼也落空了。因此，当他在那些褐色和灰色的猫头鹰中看到海德薇雪白的身影时，不禁大感意外。海德薇带着一个四四方方的大包裹落在哈利面前。片刻之后，罗恩面前也掉下来一个一模一样的包裹，他那身材娇小的猫头鹰小猪被压在下面，已经累得喘不过气来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“大概是想让大家看到他们在做事吧。”赫敏皱着眉头说，“现在人心惶惶——你知道吗，双胞胎佩蒂尔的父母要把她们接回家了。爱洛伊丝·米德根已经退学，她父亲昨天晚上来接她的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins' parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry's nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟后，当他们离开了格兰芬多餐桌，朝魁地奇球场走去时，迎面看见了拉文德·布朗和帕瓦蒂·佩蒂尔。哈利想起了赫敏说过佩蒂尔孪生姐妹的父母想要她们离开霍格沃茨的事，所以，他看到这两个好朋友在那里窃窃私语，神情忧伤，就不感到奇怪了。让他感到吃惊的是，当罗恩走过她们旁边时，帕瓦蒂突然用胳膊肘捅了捅拉文德，拉文德回过头来，送给罗恩一个灿烂的微笑。罗恩朝她眨巴眨巴眼睛，也迟疑不决地笑了笑。他走路的姿势立刻变得大摇大摆，架子十足起来。哈利看了想笑，但赶紧忍住了，他想起马尔福踩破自己鼻子时，罗恩也没有笑话自己。赫敏则显得傲慢、冷漠，她穿过冷飕飕、雾蒙蒙的毛毛细雨，走向下面的球场，然后，也没向罗恩道一声好运，就径自到看台上找座位去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如哈利早就料到的，选拔赛进行了差不多一个上午。格兰芬多学院从一年级到七年级的半数同学都来了。一年级同学紧张地攥着从学校仓库里挑出的几把破破烂烂的旧扫帚，七年级同学则显得高高大大，鹤立鸡群，气势怪吓人的。七年级同学里有一个头发又粗又硬的大个子，哈利一眼就认出他是霍格沃茨特快列车上的那个男生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You didn't try out last year, did you?" asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.</div>

<div class="line_en">He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen's face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both "old Sluggy's" favorites.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他指了指球场边缘靠近赫敏坐的地方。他仿佛看见麦克拉根脸上闪过一丝懊恼的表情，他想，莫非麦克拉根以为他们俩都是老鼻涕虫的宠儿，他就能得到特殊的待遇？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三组绕球场飞到一半时摔成了一堆。第四组的大多数人没带扫帚就来了。第五组竟然都是赫奇帕奇的学生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If there's anyone else here who's not from Gryffindor," roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, "leave now, please!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这里还有谁不是格兰芬多学院的，”哈利吼道，他心里真的恼火了，“请马上离开！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: the first ten was made up of first years, and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利决定先进行一个基本测试，他叫所有申请加入球队的人分成十个人一组，绕着球场飞一圈。这真是一个明智的决定。第一组的十个人全是一年级新生，显然，他们以前根本就没有飞过。只有一个男孩在空中待了几秒钟，他自己也吃惊得要命，结果很快就撞到了球门柱子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二组是十个女生，哈利从没碰见过这么傻的姑娘，他一吹哨子，她们就叽叽咕咕地笑得直不起腰，互相抱作一团。罗米达·万尼也在她们中间。当哈利叫她们离开球场时，她们高高兴兴地走了，然后坐在看台上七嘴八舌地互相指责着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个小时后，听了满耳朵牢骚，看了好几次他人发脾气，其中一个人还砸烂了一把彗星260，又有人打掉了几颗牙齿，哈利终于给自己挑选了三名追球手：凯蒂·贝尔，她表现出色，重新归队；一位名叫德米尔扎·罗宾斯的新秀，他躲避游走球特别敏捷；还有金妮·韦斯莱，她飞得比所有选手都快，并且投中了十七个球。哈利对他选出的这几个人很满意，但因为不停地冲许多发牢骚的人嚷嚷，他的嗓子都哑了，此刻又要对付那些落选的击球手们的抱怨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="停顿片刻后，两个拉文克劳的低年级学生扑哧一声大笑着奔出了球场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就这么定了，如果不赶快滚开让守门员进来，我就给你们施恶咒。”他吼道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他挑选的两位击球手都不如弗雷德和乔治那么出类拔萃，但还算让人满意：吉米·珀克斯，一位宽胸膛、矮个子的三年级同学，他大力击出的游走球将哈利的后脑勺撞出了一个鸡蛋那么大的鼓包；里切·古特，看上去弱不禁风，但瞄得很准。他们俩现在跟凯蒂、德米尔扎和金妮一起坐在看台上，观看哈利挑选他们的最后一名队员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good luck!" cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“祝你好运！”看台上一个声音喊道。哈利扭过头，以为看见的会是赫敏，没想到却是拉文德·布朗。片刻之后，哈利也巴不得能像她那样用两只手把脸捂住，但他觉得自己身为队长，应该表现得更有勇气一些，便转脸注视着罗恩参选。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩骑上他那把横扫11时，看上去随时都会晕倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利故意把守门员的选拔赛放在最后，希望这时候球场上的人会少一些，这样给参赛选手的压力也会小一些。不幸的是，所有那些落选的球员，还有许多拖拖拉拉刚吃完早饭的人现在又都加入到观众当中，看台上的人比刚才更多了。每位守门员飞向球门时，观众都爆发出同样热烈的欢呼声和讥笑声。哈利扫了一眼罗恩，罗恩总是有怯场的毛病。哈利本来希望他们上学期最后一场比赛大获全胜，大概可以治好他这个毛病，然而看起来没有。罗恩的脸色微微有些发绿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harry's great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前面五位选手都最多只救起了两个球。让哈利大为失望的是，考迈克·麦克拉根竟然一连救起了五个球中的四个。不过，在救最后一个球时，他朝着完全相反的方向扑去。观众们哄堂大笑，给他喝倒彩，麦克拉根咬着牙回到了球场上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他妹妹根本就没认真发球。”麦克拉根恶狠狠地说。他太阳穴上的一根血管突突直跳，这景象是哈利经常在弗农姨父身上看到并暗自称奇的。“她给他的球很容易救起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row.

<div class="line_en">After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid's. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagrid's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="定好第一次全队训练的时间是下个星期二，哈利、罗恩和赫敏便向其他队员说了声再见，朝海格的小屋走去。这时，一轮水汪汪的太阳正拼命从云彩里探出头来，毛毛雨终于停了。哈利觉得饿极了。他希望海格的小屋里能有点吃的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次真的是赫敏从看台上朝他们跑来了。哈利看见拉文德跟帕瓦蒂手挽着手走出了球场，脸上一副气呼呼的样子。罗恩似乎对自己满意极了，他看着队员和赫敏，傻呵呵地直笑，个头显得比平常更高了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes, you were magnificent," said Hermione, looking amused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，是啊，你真出色。”赫敏似乎感到很有趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To Harry's surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们——我们能做点什么吗？”赫敏没理睬使劲冲他做鬼脸、摇头的罗恩，问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's… him…" gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. "It's… Aragog… I think he's dying… He got ill over the summer and he's not getting better… I don' know what I'll do if he… if he… We've bin tergether so long…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是……是它……”海格抽泣着说，泪水从他黑亮的小眼睛里流淌下来，他用围裙擦着脸，“是……阿拉戈克……我觉得它快死了……它病了一个夏天，一直不见好……我不知道，如果它……如果它……我该怎么办……我们在一起这么长时间了……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione patted Hagrid's shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏拍着海格的肩膀，完全不知道该说什么才好。哈利明白她的感觉。他知道海格曾经把一只玩具熊送给一头凶恶的小火龙，还看见海格给那些长着吸盘和螫刺的大蝎子轻轻地哼歌儿，并试图跟他那个同母异父的弟弟、那个残暴的巨人讲道理，但是，在海格喜欢过的所有这些庞然大物中，要数这个最难让人理解了：阿拉戈克，一只会说话的巨型蜘蛛，居住在禁林深处，四年前，哈利和罗恩差点儿在它那里送了命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don' think there is, Hermione," choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. "See, the rest of the tribe… Aragog's family… they're getting a bit funny now he's ill… bit restive…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕没办法了，赫敏，”海格抽抽搭搭地说，拼命忍住汹涌而下的泪水，“知道吗，在部落里……在阿拉戈克家族里……它们看到它病了，表现得很奇怪……有点儿不好控制了……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We couldn't have done," said Hermione. "We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们用不上了。”赫敏说，“夏天我们在魔法部时，把部里库存的时间转换器都砸碎了。《预言家日报》上写着呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"… I don' reckon it'd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo'," Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. "But thanks fer offering, Hermione… It means a lot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“……我想，眼下除了我，不管谁走近那片地方都不安全。”海格说完，在围裙上使劲擤了擤鼻子，抬起了头，“不过谢谢你这么说，赫敏……这对我来说太重要了……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那之后，气氛就变得轻松多了，尽管哈利和罗恩都没有表示出愿意拿巨蛴螬去喂一只凶狠残暴、体格庞大的蜘蛛，但海格似乎想当然地认为他们有这个意思，于是，他立刻恢复了常态。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们三个听了这话，立刻言不由衷地声讨起了曾给海格代过几次课的格拉普兰教授，一口咬定她是一个特别糟糕的老师。结果，当黄昏降临，海格站在屋外同他们挥手告别时，他显得情绪高昂多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么啦？”赫敏警觉地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm starving," said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. "And I've got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven't got much time for dinner."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我饿坏了。”小屋的门一关上，他们匆匆走在昏暗的、空无一人的场地上时，哈利便说道。刚才他在吃岩皮饼时，一颗后槽牙不祥地嘎巴响了一下，他便赶紧把饼放下了。“我今天晚上还要到斯内普那里去关禁闭呢，没有多少时间吃晚饭了……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们进了城堡，正好看见考迈克·麦克拉根走进大礼堂。他走了两次才穿过那道门，第一次撞到门框上弹了回来。罗恩幸灾乐祸地大笑起来，跟在他后面大摇大摆地走进了礼堂，哈利一把抓住赫敏的胳膊，把她拉了回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, all right then, I did it," she whispered. "But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he's got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn't get in -- you wouldn't have wanted someone like that on the team."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，好吧，是我干的，”她小声说，“但是你真应该听听他是怎么议论罗恩和金妮的！而且，他的脾气坏透了，你看见他落选后是个什么反应——你肯定不希望球队里有这么一个家伙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!" he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly, "I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We're having a little party, just a few rising stars, I've got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin -- I don't know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries -- and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，哈利，正是我希望见到的人！”他热情地大声说，手指玩弄着海象胡须尖，鼓着大肚子，“我就希望在吃饭前堵住你！今天晚上到我那里去吃一顿便饭如何？我们有一个小小的晚会，只请了几位冉冉升起的新星。我邀请了麦克拉根、沙比尼，还有迷人的梅林达·波宾——不知道你是不是认识她，她家里开着大型的连锁药店——还有，当然啦，我非常希望格兰杰小姐也能赏光。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他根本就不可能说服斯内普，”哈利等到斯拉格霍恩走得听不见了，便说道，“这个禁闭已经被推迟了一次。斯内普上回是看在邓布利多的面子上，他绝不会再为任何人推迟了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭后，他们回到格兰芬多塔楼。这时候大部分同学都已经吃过晚饭，公共休息室里非常拥挤，但他们总算找到一张空桌子坐了下来。自从他们跟斯拉格霍恩碰过面后，罗恩就一直闷闷不乐。他抱着双臂，皱着眉头，望着天花板。赫敏伸手拿来了别人扔在一把椅子上的一份《预言家晚报》。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not really…" Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. "Oh, look, your dad's in here, Ron -- he's all right!" she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. "It just says he's been to visit the Malfoys' house.
