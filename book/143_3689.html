<div class="line_en">Don Croce had summoned him from Corleone and instructed him. He was to join Guiliano's band and win their confidence. He was to stay with them until Don Croce gave orders as to his future course of action. Meanwhile he was to send back information as to Guiliano's real strength, the loyalty of Passatempo and Terranova. Since Pisciotta's loyalty was unquestioned there remained only to evaluate that young man's weaknesses. And if the opportunity arose, Andolini was to kill Guiliano.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even in Sicily, a land where men killed each other with the same ferocious enthusiasm with which the Spaniards slaughtered bulls, the murderous madness of the citizens of Corleone inspired a universal dread. Rival families exterminated each other in a quarrel over a single olive tree, neighbors might kill each other over the amount of water one took from a communal stream, a man could die from love -- that is, if he looked too disrespectfully at a wife or daughter. Even the cool-headed Friends of the Friends succumbed to this madness and their different branches warred to death in Corleone until Don Croce brought them to peace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta listened to Stefano Andolini's story with an impassive face. Andolini told him that the carabinieri and Security Police were looking for him because of the murder of a Socialist agitator in Corleone. This was quite true. What Andolini did not say was that the police and carabinieri had no proof and were merely seeking him for questioning. A questioning that would be more kindly than exhaustive due to the influence of Don Croce. Andolini also told Pisciotta that the two picciotti with him were men who were also being sought by the police as co-conspirators in the killing. This was also true. But as he was telling this story Stefano Andolini felt a mounting uneasiness. Pisciotta was listening with the expression of a man who has met someone he has known before or of whom he has heard a great deal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔不动声色地听着斯特凡·安多里尼的叙述。安多里尼对他说，宪兵和国家警察在找他，因为在柯里昂有一个鼓吹社会主义的人遭到谋杀。这确实是真的，不过有一点安多里尼没有说，那就是警察和宪兵都没有任何证据，只是想找他询问情况。在唐·克罗切的影响下，这样的询问会很温和，不会刨根问底。安多里尼还对皮肖塔说，这两个年轻人被当作同谋，也是警察追捕的对象，这也是真的。可是在讲述过程中，他感到越来越不安。皮肖塔的神情，好像正看着一个老熟人，又好像是一个知道很多事的人才有的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He picked two young picciotti to go with him, that is, apprentice killers, who had not yet been admitted to the Mafia but hoped for that honor.

<div class="line_en">Andolini had no fear of the great Guiliano. Also, since he was redheaded, and redheads were so rare in Italy, Stefano Andolini secretly believed he had been excused from the rules of virtue.

<div class="line_en">Andolini said that he had come into the mountains in the hope of joining Guiliano's band. And then he played his trump card. He had the stamp of approval from Guiliano's father himself. He, Stefano Andolini, was a cousin of the great Don Vito Corleone, in America. Pisciotta nodded. Andolini went on. Don Vito Corleone had been born an Andolini in the village of Corleone. His father killed, himself hunted as a boy, he had escaped to America where he had become the great Godfather. When he had returned to Sicily to wreak vengeance on his father's murderers, Stefano Andolini had been one of his picciotti. Thereafter he had visited the Don in America to receive his reward. While there he had met Guiliano's father who worked as a bricklayer on the Don's new mansion on Long Island. They had become friends, and Andolini, before he came into the mountains, had stopped in Montelepre to receive the blessing of Salvatore Guiliano Senior.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other men of Guiliano's band had sprung to their feet leveling their guns. Andolini, sitting on the ground, raised his hands in the air and looked around him beseechingly. But the other picciotto lunged for his weapon and tried to bring it around. Passatempo, standing behind him and grinning with enjoyment, emptied his pistol into the man's head. The shots echoed through the mountains. They all remained frozen, Andolini pale and shaking with fear, Passatempo holding his pistol. And then Guiliano's voice from the edge of the cliff said quietly, "Get rid of the bodies and tie that Malpelo to a tree until my father comes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺队伍中的其他人这时全都端着枪站起来。坐在地上的安多里尼把双手高高举起，以哀求的目光向四周看了看。另一个跟班急忙出手去抓枪，想把它取下来。站在他身后的帕萨藤珀高兴得咧嘴一笑，把手枪里的子弹尽数射进了他的脑袋，枪声在大山里回响，所有的人都愣住了。安多里尼脸色苍白，吓得直打哆嗦。帕萨藤珀握着手枪。这时候，悬崖边传来吉里安诺平静的声音：“把尸体处理掉，把红头发绑在树上，等我父亲来了再说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He waited for a few moments, making sure his men were ready. Then he reached down to take the lupare from Andolini's two picciotti. One of them, more from fear than malice, pushed Pisciotta away and put his hand on his shotgun. In the next moment, quickly as a snake baring its tongue, a knife appeared in Pisciotta's hand. His body darted forward and the knife cut the picciotto's throat. A fountain of pink blood burst into the clear mountain air and the picciotto slumped over on his side. Pisciotta was straddling his body, leaning down, and another quick stroke finished the job. Then, with a series of quick kicks, he rolled the body into a gully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稍后，他让手下人做好准备，然后伸手去拿安多里尼那两个小老弟身上的短筒猎枪。其中一个并非出于恶意，而是出于害怕，推了皮肖塔一把，接着就把手放在那把枪上。皮肖塔就像蛇突然吐出信子一样迅速亮出一把刀，一个箭步冲上去，用手中的刀割开了那人的喉咙。一股殷红的鲜血喷进山上清新的空气中，那家伙一头栽下去。皮肖塔两腿叉开，身体前倾，紧接着又是一刀，结果了他的性命。随后他连续踢了几脚，把尸体踢进一条溪谷。">查看中文翻译</div>

They were thrown in with stones tumbled down after them to keep the stench from rising, according to old superstition. This was a task for Passatempo, who robbed the bodies before he buried them.

The authorities have become amazingly clever. I sit on my mountain and think all day. I think of the authorities in Palermo -- they have never been so clever before. And then I learn that the Minister of Justice in Rome and Don Croce are hand in glove. And we know, you and I, that Don Croce is clever enough for both of them. So then it is Don Croce who is clearing away these bandits for Rome. And then I think soon it will be my turn to be visited by the spies of Don Croce.

It was not that they objected to him killing Andolini -- he could kill a hundred Andolinis, a thousand. But that he should break his word to his father and deceive him seemed to them unforgivable.

<div class="line_en">Guiliano stared at him with amazement and the redheaded man spoke in an outpouring of words. "You once said to the Abbot that you owed him a service. That he could ask you for anything." Guiliano remembered his promise well. How did the man know about it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺以惊异的目光看着他。这个红头发的家伙振振有词地说：“你曾经对院长说你欠他的情，还说他要你做什么都可以。”对自己的这项承诺，吉里安诺记得很清楚，可是这个人是怎么知道的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano and his band arrived at the monastery gates as the sun was rising and the monks were going out to work the fields. Turi Guiliano watched them, a smile on his lips. Was it only two years ago that he had gone into the fields with these priests, wearing his brown cloak and the crumpled black American fedora on his head? He remembered how this amused him. Who would have dreamed then of his future ferocity? A nostalgia came for those old days of peace working in the fields.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Abbot himself was coming toward the gate to greet them. The tall black-robed figure hesitated when the prisoner stepped forward, then opened his arms. Stefano Andolini rushed to embrace the old man, kissed him on both cheeks and said, " Father. these men are going to kill me, only you can save me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院长亲自到大门口来迎接。被押来的人向前走了几步，瘦高个儿、身穿黑色长袍的院长有些犹豫，接着张开了双臂。斯特凡·安多里尼扑上前去拥抱老院长，在他左右面颊上吻了吻，而后说：“神父，这些人要杀我，只有你能救我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Abbot nodded. He held out his arms to Guiliano, who came forward to embrace him. Guiliano understood everything now. The peculiar accent on the word "Father" was not how a man addressed his priest but as a son addressed his parent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院长点点头。他向吉里安诺伸出双臂，吉里安诺上前来与他拥抱。现在吉里安诺什么都明白了。安多里尼那一声“神父”不是一个人称呼神父的语气，而是儿子称呼父亲的语气。">查看中文翻译</div>

I did not resist them. The scandal was covered up and his mother was married to an Andolini. A great deal of money passed and I was able to rise in the Church.

<div class="line_en">From that day Stefano Andolini was a member of Guiliano's band. And in the years to come he became so known for ferociousness and religious piety that his nickname, Fra Diavalo, became famous all over Sicily. The piety came from the fact that every Sunday he went to Mass. He usually went in the town of Villaba, where Father Beniamino was the priest. And in the confessional he told the secrets of Guiliano's band to his confessor to be relayed to Don Croce. But not the secrets Guiliano ordered him not to tell.</div>
