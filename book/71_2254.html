<div class="line_en">"So! It is just as I thought yesterday," the innkeeper said triumphantly, without even waiting for Franz to put the question to him, "when I didn't want to promise you anything, Excellency.

<div class="line_en">"And I, dear Signor Pastrini," said Franz, "since I am not our neighbour the millionaire, I must warn you that this is my fourth visit to Rome, and consequently I know the price of a barouche on weekdays, Sundays and holidays. We shall give you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow and the day after, and you will still have a very handsome bonus."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不是一位百万富翁，不象我们那位邻居，”弗兰士说，“我警告你，我到罗马来过四次了，各种马车的价钱我都知道。今天，明天，后天，我们一共给你十二个毕阿士特，那样你已经很可以赚一笔钱的了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come, my dear fellow, come," said Franz, "or else I'll go myself and bargain with your affettatore, who also happens to be mine.

<div class="line_en">And, indeed, an hour later the carriage was waiting for the two young men: it was a simple cab which, in view of the solemnity of the occasion, had been elevated to the rank of barouche. But, despite its unassuming appearance, the two men would have been very pleased to have such a vehicle for the last three days of carnival.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一小时以后，马车的确已在等着那两位青年人了。那是一辆蹩脚的出租马车，现在却已被高抬身价，当作一辆私家轿车；但它的外貌虽则微贱，这两个青年要是在狂欢节的最后三天能弄到这样的一辆马车，他们就要认为是很幸福的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Excellency!" the guide cried, seeing Franz looking out of the window. "Should we bring the coach to the palace door?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Even though Franz was accustomed to Italian exaggeration, his first impulse was to look around; but the words were indeed addressed to him. He, Franz, was the Excellency; the hackney cab was the coach; and the palace was the Hôtel de Londres. In that single phrase was contained the whole genius of a nation that knows how to turn a compliment better than any other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士对于意大利人的措辞虽然早已习惯，他的第一个冲动还是得四周环顾一下，但这句话是对他说的。弗兰士是“大人”，蹩脚马车是“花车”，而伦敦旅馆是“王宫”。意大利人爱恭维的习惯在那一句话里已表现得很充分了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz consequently told the driver which route he should take: he was to go out through the Porta del Popolo, follow the outer wall, then come back into the city through the Porta San Giovanni. In this way, the Colosseum would appear before them with no prior rehearsal -- that is to say, without the Capitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimus Severus, the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the Via Sacra serving as so many steps on the road, to reduce its magnificence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士要从波波罗门出城，绕城一周，再从圣·乔凡尼门进城，这样，他们就可以在赴斗兽场去的途中顺便看看朱庇特神殿，古市场，色铁穆斯·塞维露斯宫的拱门，安多尼的圣殿和萨克拉废墟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"First of all to Saint Peter's, of course, then to the Colosseum," said Albert, like a true Parisian. However, there was one thing that Albert did not know, which is that you need a day to see St Peter's and a month to study it. The day was consequently spent solely in visiting St Peter's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先到圣·彼得教堂，然后再到斗兽场①。”阿尔培回答。但阿尔培却不知道，看遍圣·彼得教堂得花一天功夫，而研究它则要花一个月。一天的时间在圣·彼得教堂一处过去了。【注：①罗马的斗兽场，在纪元七五年开始建造，八〇年完成，规模宏大，后毁于火。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly the two friends noticed that the sun was starting to go down. Franz took out his watch: it was half-past four, so they immediately set off back to the hotel. At the door, Franz ordered the driver to be ready at eight. He wanted to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight, as he had shown him St Peter's in broad daylight. When one is showing a friend round a city that one already knows, one does so with the same coquetry as when showing off a woman who has been one's mistress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，日光开始黯淡起来。弗兰士摸出表来一看，已经四点半钟了。他们回到旅馆去，在旅馆门口，弗兰士吩咐车夫在八点钟再来。他要领阿尔培在月光下去凭吊斗兽场，正如他曾领他在白天里游览圣·彼得教堂一样。当我们领一位朋友去游览一个我们已经去玩过的城市的时候，我们心中的得意，正如我们指出一个曾做过我们情妇的女人一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But, then," said Albert, unhurriedly blowing his smoke towards the ceiling and leaning backwards, balancing on the two rear legs of his chair, "it is only fools and innocents like ourselves who travel. Sensible men stay in their apartments in the Rue du Helder, and don't stray beyond the Boulevard de Gand and the Café de Paris." It goes without saying that Albert lived in the aforementioned street, took his daily walk down the said fashionable thoroughfare and dined every day in the only café where one does dine -- at least, assuming one is on good terms with the waiters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，”阿尔培喷出一大口烟，翘起椅子的两条腿，晃着身体说，“只有疯子或象我们这样的傻子才会出门旅行。凡是神志清醒的人是不肯离开他们海尔达路的大厦，放弃他们在林荫大道上的散步和巴黎咖啡馆的。”不用说，阿尔培当然是住在上面所提及的那条街上，每天要很出风头地去散一回步，而且常常到那家惟一真正可以吃点东西的咖啡馆去的，当然，你还得和侍者有交情。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then all we have to do is ask for a coach and two horses from his stables and we can see the carnival by coach.

When they spoke, though Teresa was listening shyly and with lowered gaze to the young nobleman's words, Luigi could read in the man's eyes that they were compliments, and it seemed to him that the earth was spinning beneath his feet, while all the voices of hell whispered ideas of murder and violence. Then, fearing that he might be carried away by his folly, with one hand he clasped the arbour beneath which he was standing, and with the other he grasped convulsively the dagger with the sculpted hilt which he kept in his belt and which, unconsciously, he was drawing from time to time almost entirely out of its sheath."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What do you expect? He is in league with the shepherds of the plain, the Tiber fishermen and the coastal smugglers. If they go looking for him in the mountains, he is on the river; if they hunt him down the river, he is out at sea; then suddenly, when they think he has taken refuge on the islands of Giglio, Guanouti or Monte Cristo, he reappears in Albano, Tivoli or La Riccia."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very simply. According to the distance from the city, he allows them eight hours, twelve hours or a day to pay their ransom. Then, when the time has elapsed, he gives them an hour's grace. On the sixtieth minute of that hour, if he does not have the money, he blows out the prisoner's brains with his pistol or buries his dagger in his heart, and there's an end to it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？他的办法非常简单。他根据离城的远近，限定八小时，十二小时，或是一天，在这个时间内叫他们把赎金付出来，过了那个时间，他再宽限一小时。到达一小时的第六十分钟，假使钱还没有送到，他就用手枪把肉票的脑髓打出来，或是把他的短刀插进他的心里，那也就了账了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
