<div class="line_en">So when I was in my mom's stomach, no one had any idea I would come out looking the way I look. Mom had had Via four years before, and that had been such a "walk in the park" (Mom's expression) that there was no reason to run any special tests. About two months before I was born, the doctors realized there was something wrong with my face, but they didn't think it was going to be bad. They told Mom and Dad I had a cleft palate and some other stuff going on. They called it "small anomalies."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时候我还在妈妈肚子里，没有人知道我生出来会是这个样子。妈妈在此四年前生了维娅，那简直就像“在公园散步”（按她的说法），因此她没有理由去做任何特殊检查。大概在我出生前两个月，医生才意识到我的脸有点不对劲，但他们压根没想到会是一张坏脸。他们告诉妈妈和爸爸，我有腭裂，还有一些别的问题。他们称之为“小小的异常”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were two nurses in the delivery room the night I was born. One was very nice and sweet. The other one, Mom said, did not seem at all nice or sweet. She had very big arms and (here comes the funny part), she kept farting. Like, she'd bring Mom some ice chips, and then fart. She'd check Mom's blood pressure, and fart. Mom says it was unbelievable because the nurse never even said excuse me! Meanwhile, Mom's regular doctor wasn't on duty that night, so Mom got stuck with this cranky kid doctor she and Dad nicknamed Doogie after some old TV show or something (they didn't actually call him that to his face). But Mom says that even though everyone in the room was kind of grumpy, Dad kept making her laugh all night long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我出生那天晚上，产房里有两个护士。一个非常甜美。另一个，妈妈说看起来一点也不甜或者美，她手臂粗壮而且不停地放屁（正是这一点十分有趣）。比如，她给妈妈拿冰块来，放个屁。她给妈妈量血压，放个屁。妈妈说，不可思议的是，这个护士竟然从来不说对不起！同时，妈妈的主治医生那晚不值班，因此她不得不接受一个脾气暴躁的儿科医生——后来她和爸爸根据某部老电视剧给他取了个外号，叫“杜奇”（实际上他们从来没有当面叫过他）。妈妈说，虽然那天产房里每个人都有点急躁，但爸爸整晚都在逗她开心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I came out of Mom's stomach, she said the whole room got very quiet. Mom didn't even get a chance to look at me because the nice nurse immediately rushed me out of the room. Dad was in such a hurry to follow her that he dropped the video camera, which broke into a million pieces. And then Mom got very upset and tried to get out of bed to see where they were going, but the farting nurse put her very big arms on Mom to keep her down in the bed. They were practically fighting, because Mom was hysterical and the farting nurse was yelling at her to stay calm, and then they both started screaming for the doctor. But guess what? He had fainted! Right on the floor! So when the farting nurse saw that he had fainted, she started pushing him with her foot to get him to wake up, yelling at him the whole time: "What kind of doctor are you? What kind of doctor are you? Get up! Get up!" And then all of a sudden she let out the biggest, loudest, smelliest fart in the history of farts. Mom thinks it was actually the fart that finally woke the doctor up. Anyway, when Mom tells this story, she acts out all the parts -- including the farting noises -- and it is so, so, so, so funny!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我从妈妈肚子里出来的时候，她说整个产房顿时鸦雀无声。妈妈甚至都没机会看我一眼，因为那个甜美的护士立即抱着我冲出了产房。为了跟上她，爸爸在忙乱中把摄影机掉到了地上，摔了个稀巴烂。妈妈很恼火，努力挣扎着想下床去看看他们去了哪儿，但是“放屁护士”用非常粗壮的胳膊压着妈妈，让她待在床上。她们几乎打了起来，因为妈妈已经歇斯底里，而“放屁护士”仍冲她大喊大叫，要她冷静，接着她们又同时冲医生尖叫。猜猜发生了什么事？他昏倒了！直接倒在地上！“放屁护士”看见他昏倒在地，便想用脚把他推醒，她一直冲他叫喊：“你这算哪门子医生？你这算哪门子医生？起来啊！起来！”然后，她突然放了史上最大、最响、最臭的一个屁。妈妈认为，实际上正是这个屁让医生苏醒过来。不管怎么样，妈妈讲这个故事的时候，总是绘声绘色、活灵活现——包括发出真正的放屁的声音——实在是太搞笑了！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mom says by then they had told her all about me. She had been preparing herself for the seeing of me. But she says that when she looked down into my tiny mushed-up face for the first time, all she could see was how pretty my eyes were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈说，当时医生已经把我的全部情况都告诉了她。她也一直在做看到我的心理准备。但是她说，当她低下头，一眼看到我皱巴巴糊成一团的小脸时，她只觉得我的眼睛是那么漂亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mom says the farting nurse turned out to be a very nice woman. She stayed with Mom the whole time. Didn't leave her side even after Dad came back and the doctors told them how sick I was. Mom remembers exactly what the nurse whispered in her ear when the doctor told her I probably wouldn't live through the night: "Everyone born of God overcometh the world." And the next day, after I had lived through the night, it was that nurse who held Mom's hand when they brought her to meet me for the first time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈说，“放屁护士”原来是一个很好的女人。她从头到尾都陪伴着妈妈，即使在爸爸回到病房后，在医生告诉他们我的病有多严重时也不离不弃。妈妈至今还清楚地记得，当医生告诉她我可能活不过当晚时，护士在她耳边悄声说：“凡从神生的，就胜过世界。”第二天，在我挺过那个晚上后，也是这个护士握着妈妈的手，带她跟我见第一面。">查看中文翻译</div>
