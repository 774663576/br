<div class="line_en">The natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood seems to require, that in order to portray it in vivid tints, which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience, one must not be too old. The delicious fancies of youth reject the least savour of a mature philosophy, as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom. And, therefore, I know I incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the Court and Parliament of Love. But from these formidable censors I shall appeal to my seniors. For it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak, though it begin with the young, yet forsakes not the old, or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old, but makes the aged participators of it, not less than the tender maiden, though in a different and nobler sort. For it is a fire that, kindling its first embers in the narrow nook of a private bosom, caught from a wandering spark out of another private heart, glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon the universal heart of all, and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames. It matters not, therefore, whether we attempt to describe the passion at twenty, at thirty, or at eighty years. He who paints it at the first period will lose some of its later, he who paints it at the last, some of its earlier traits. Only it is to be hoped that, by patience and the Muses' aid, we may attain to that inward view of the law, which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful, so central that it shall commend itself to the eye, at whatever angle beholden.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments; each of its joys ripens into a new want. Nature, uncontainable, flowing, forelooking, in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light. The introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one, which is the enchantment of human life; which, like a certain divine rage and enthusiasm, seizes on man at one period, and works a revolution in his mind and body; unites him to his race, pledges him to the domestic and civic relations, carries him with new sympathy into nature, enhances the power of the senses, opens the imagination, adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes, establishes marriage, and gives permanence to human society.</div>

<div class="line_en">And the first condition is, that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history. For each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured, as the life of man is not, to his imagination. Each man sees over his own experience a certain stain of error, whilst that of other men looks fair and ideal. Let any man go back to those delicious relations which make the beauty of his life, which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment, he will shrink and moan. Alas! I know not why, but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy, and cover every beloved name. Every thing is beautiful seen from the point of the intellect, or as truth. But all is sour, if seen as experience. Details are melancholy; the plan is seemly and noble. In the actual world -- the painful kingdom of time and place -- dwell care, and canker, and fear. With thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of joy. Round it all the Muses sing. But grief cleaves to names, and persons, and the partial interests of to-day and yesterday.</div>

<div class="line_en">The strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society. What do we wish to know of any worthy person so much, as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment? What books in the circulating libraries circulate? How we glow over these novels of passion, when the story is told with any spark of truth and nature! And what fastens attention, in the intercourse of life, like any passage betraying affection between two parties? Perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall meet them again. But we see them exchange a glance, or betray a deep emotion, and we are no longer strangers. We understand them, and take the warmest interest in the development of the romance. All mankind love a lover. The earliest demonstrations of complacency and kindness are nature's most winning pictures. It is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic. The rude village boy teases the girls about the school-house door; -- but to-day he comes running into the entry, and meets one fair child disposing her satchel; he holds her books to help her, and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely, and was a sacred precinct. Among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough, but one alone distances him; and these two little neighbours, that were so close just now, have learned to respect each other's personality. Or who can avert his eyes from the engaging, half-artful, half-artless ways of school-girls who go into the country shops to buy a skein of silk or a sheet of paper, and talk half an hour about nothing with the broad-faced, good-natured shop-boy. In the village they are on a perfect equality, which love delights in, and without any coquetry the happy, affectionate nature of woman flows out in this pretty gossip. The girls may have little beauty, yet plainly do they establish between them and the good boy the most agreeable, confiding relations, what with their fun and their earnest, about Edgar, and Jonas, and Almira, and who was invited to the party, and who danced at the dancing-school, and when the singing-school would begin, and other nothings concerning which the parties cooed. By and by that boy wants a wife, and very truly and heartily will he know where to find a sincere and sweet mate, without any risk such as Milton deplores as incident to scholars and great men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在社交中，人们很乐于谈论私人关系这一话题。由此可以看出，人们都具有喜爱谈论别人的天性。对于一个名人，还有什么能比他的风流逸事更让人感兴趣呢？巡回图书馆里经常被人借阅的，都是哪些书呢？如果一本爱情小说里充满了真情与天性，那么我们一定会对这本小说爱不释手。流露出缱绻深情的交往，无疑是生活中最引人入胜的一幕。也许我们不认识他们，以后也不会再见到他们，可是当我们看到他们互相爱慕或者难舍难分时，我们和他们就不再是陌生人。我们理解他们，并把自己的热情也倾注到了这段恋情的进展上。每个有情人都会受到世人的关爱。天性中最吸引人的，就是我们一副满怀抱负、仁慈、宽厚的样子。即使是粗俗的人，只要他身上显露出这种样子，那么他就是文明人。村里有一个野小子，他经常在校门口戏耍女孩子们，可是今天，他来到教室里，看见一个可爱的女孩在整理书包，就走过去和她一起整理起来。这时，他才突然觉得自己与她差距很大，并认为她神圣不可侵犯。他可以在女孩儿堆里无所顾忌，却会与她保持距离。刚才，这两个人还是两小无猜的小伙伴；可是现在，他们却懂得了要相互尊重。乡村里的女学生们，走进店铺去买丝线或作业本，一待就是半个小时，因为她们在跟那个好脾气的圆脸小店员聊天。她们在与小店员聊天时，带着既狡黠又天真的表情，任谁看了她们那迷人的样子，都会忍不住回过头多看两眼。在这个村子里，所有人都是平等的，这就是爱所希望的。在这种闲聊中，女人们虽然没有卖弄风情，却在不经意流露出快乐和天性。这些女孩也许不太漂亮，可是她们显然已经与那个小店员成了无话不谈的好朋友，这种关系令人想来就觉得惬意。她们半真半假地说着，从艾德加、乔那斯、埃尔默拉谈到参加上次聚会的人，还提起了谁在学习跳舞、唱歌学校几时开学，以及其他一些正在被人私下议论的无聊话题。不久之后，这个小店员想到了结婚，因为他已经知道在哪儿能找到既可靠又可爱的姑娘。可是，学者和伟人们却没有这样的好运，就像弥尔顿说的那样，他们要冒找不到忠诚伴侣的风险。相比之下，这个小店员要幸运多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have been told, that in some public discourses of mine my reverence for the intellect has made me unjustly cold to the personal relations. But now I almost shrink at the remembrance of such disparaging words. For persons are love's world, and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love, without being tempted to unsay, as treasonable to nature, aught derogatory to the social instincts. For, though the celestial rapture falling out of heaven seizes only upon those of tender age, and although a beauty overpowering all analysis or comparison, and putting us quite beside ourselves, we can seldom see after thirty years, yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances, and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows. But here is a strange fact; it may seem to many men, in revising their experience, that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances. In looking backward, they may find that several things which were not the charm have more reality to this groping memory than the charm itself which embalmed them. But be our experience in particulars what it may, no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things new; which was the dawn in him of music, poetry, and art; which made the face of nature radiant with purple light, the morning and the night varied enchantments; when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound, and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory; when he became all eye when one was present, and all memory when one was gone; when the youth becomes a watcher of windows, and studious of a glove, a veil, a ribbon, or the wheels of a carriage; when no place is too solitary, and none too silent, for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts, than any old friends, though best and purest, can give him; for the figures, the motions, the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water, but, as Plutarch said, "enamelled in fire," and make the study of midnight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人对我说过，我很理智，这在我的一些公开演讲里表现得很明显。但是，也正因为我很理智，所以我在私人关系中显得过于冷漠。这种不实的言论，让我回想起来都会感到害怕。要知道，有人就有爱。年轻的灵魂游走在自然界里，直到遇到爱才安定下来。即使是最冷静的哲学家，他在描述这种恩典时，也会舍弃那些有违社会本能的话，因为这些话是不符合人性的。虽然只有年轻男女有机会享受上天恩赐的兴奋，虽然中年妇女很少有让人魂牵梦萦的漂亮脸蛋，可是最令人难以忘怀的，却是人们自身的经历。不过，这里有一件事让人很奇怪：许多人在回忆自己的经历时，好像都会觉得他们一生中最美好的时光就是回忆一些甜蜜的往事。当人们在回忆甜蜜往事时，会发现那些偶然发生的琐事被爱情赋予了一种魅力，这种魅力竟然比爱情本身还具有吸引力。另外，人们在回忆往事时，会发现那些原本并不神奇的事件比那些神奇的事件更加有魅力。然而，不管我们经历过什么，那种力量给我们心灵留下的印象都是不可磨灭的。正是这种力量，让万物面目一新。它启发了我们对音乐、诗歌和艺术的创作灵感，让大自然容光焕发，让时间具有无限的吸引力。在这种力量的支配下，人们会因为一个细微的声响而激动万分，因为一个身影而回忆与之相关的点点滴滴。在这种力量的支配下，只要她一出现，他就无法把自己的视线从她身上移开；她一离开，他就牵肠挂肚。在这种力量的支配下，年轻男子整天凝视着一扇窗户，哪怕只看见一只手套、一副面纱、一根丝带，甚至是马车轮子，他也会非常向往。在这种力量的支配下，他会觉得没有了她，一切都显得很孤单、寂寞，只有跟她进行交谈才是甜蜜的，这种甜蜜是那些既善良又纯洁的老朋友也无法带给他的。他倾慕那个爱人的一切行为，在他眼里，这些行为不同于镜花水月的其他形象，而是像普鲁塔克所说的“用火烧过的瓷釉”，是让他魂牵梦萦的对象。">查看中文翻译</div>

Every bird on the boughs of the tree sings now to his heart and soul. The notes are almost articulate. The clouds have faces as he looks on them.

<div class="line_en">And here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that influence which is thus potent over the human youth. Beauty, whose revelation to man we now celebrate, welcome as the sun wherever it pleases to shine, which pleases everybody with it and with themselves, seems sufficient to itself. The lover cannot paint his maiden to his fancy poor and solitary. Like a tree in flower, so much soft, budding, informing love-liness is society for itself, and she teaches his eye why Beauty was pictured with Loves and Graces attending her steps. Her existence makes the world rich. Though she extrudes all other persons from his attention as cheap and unworthy, she indemnifies him by carrying out her own being into somewhat impersonal, large, mundane, so that the maiden stands to him for a representative of all select things and virtues. For that reason, the lover never sees personal resemblances in his mistress to her kindred or to others. His friends find in her a likeness to her mother, or her sisters, or to persons not of her blood. The lover sees no resemblance except to summer evenings and diamond mornings, to rainbows and the song of birds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由此可见，激情会对青年产生巨大的影响。在这里，让我们围绕这个影响的性质作深入的讨论。在阳光所能照射到的地方，每个人都会因为阳光的到来而欣喜。我们现在所讨论的美，就像阳光一样。美给人以启发，让每个人都对它并对自己感到满意，进而使美也有一种自我满足感。如果一个男人爱慕某个姑娘，那么他绝对不可能用“可怜”和“孤单”来形容她，他会把她看做一棵开满鲜花的树。社会也有许多像花朵一样吸引人的地方。那个姑娘会教导他用眼睛发现社会的美，并在描绘社会的美时不自觉地加入与自己相关的“关爱”和“雅致”，使世界因为她的存在而变得丰富多彩。另外，由于她认为其他任何东西都是既卑贱又没有价值的，所以她把它们都赶到了他的视线之外。不过，为了补偿他，她让自己变得高尚而又充满生活气息，令他觉得她是世间一切美好事物的化身。因此，他无法从这位姑娘的亲属和旁人身上找到与她相像的外貌，尽管他的朋友都说她跟她的母亲和姐妹，甚至是与她没有血缘关系的人都很像。在这位情郎眼里，他的心上人就如同夏日的黄昏、美丽的黎明，甚至像光彩夺目的彩虹、歌声婉转的飞鸟，怎么看怎么好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue. Who can analyze the nameless charm which glances from one and another face and form? We are touched with emotions of tenderness and complacency, but we cannot find whereat this dainty emotion, this wandering gleam, points. It is destroyed for the imagination by any attempt to refer it to organization. Nor does it point to any relations of friendship or love known and described in society, but, as it seems to me, to a quite other and unattainable sphere, to relations of transcendent delicacy and sweetness, to what roses and violets hint and fore-show. We cannot approach beauty. Its nature is like opaline doves'-neck lustres, hovering and evanescent. Herein it resembles the most excellent things, which all have this rainbow character, defying all attempts at appropriation and use. What else did Jean Paul Richter signify, when he said to music, "Away! away! thou speakest to me of things which in all my endless life I have not found, and shall not find." The same fluency may be observed in every work of the plastic arts. The statue is then beautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing out of criticism, and can no longer be defined by compass and measuring-wand, but demands an active imagination to go with it, and to say what it is in the act of doing. The god or hero of the sculptor is always represented in a transition from that which is representable to the senses, to that which is not. Then first it ceases to be a stone. The same remark holds of painting. And of poetry, the success is not attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it astonishes and fires us with new endeavours after the unattainable. Concerning it, Landor inquires "whether it is not to be referred to some purer state of sensation and existence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“德行会像花一样开出美。”这是古人对美的描述。一张平凡的面孔、一个普通的身影，都可以散发出不可名状的美。其中的原因，谁又能说得清呢？我们可以感觉到缠绵的柔情、激昂的壮志，却不知道这些微妙的情愫到底来自哪里。如果我们强行用生理学来解释它，就会把它从想象的国度里驱逐出去。在我看来，美并不是我们常见的友情或爱情，而是另外一个我们无法企及的领域里的东西，它是一种既甜蜜又难以捉摸的微妙感觉，是能让我们从玫瑰和紫罗兰那里得到启发的事物。可是，我们却无法靠近它。它就像乳白色鸽子脖颈上那一闪而过的光泽。从这一点上分析，它和那些精彩绝伦的东西是一样的，都像彩虹一样既无法被占有又不能被利用。保罗•里西德尔喜爱音乐，可他后来却对音乐说：“你走吧！你说的那些美好的事物，我用尽一生一世都没有找到，而且永远都不可能找到。”他这句话，难道另有所指？从艺术作品之中，我们也能发现这种感觉。比如一尊雕塑，它刚问世时可能无法被人理解，后来它的存在慢慢地被人们承认，再往后则令人打破规则并展开想象的翅膀，进而使人们了解它是什么。也只有在这一刻，这个塑像才是美的。雕刻家在雕刻时，只有经历了可以诉之于感官到不可诉之于感官的过程，才算真正进入创作的佳境。也只有在这时，雕塑的对象才不再只是一块顽石。这种说法，对绘画也适用。诗歌的情况稍有不同，它要想取得成功，靠的不是使人感到平静和满足，而是能够振奋人心并激励人们再次为那些难以企及的理想而努力。关于这一点，兰多是这么看的：“它会不会与某种纯洁的感情有关呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In like manner, personal beauty is then first charming and itself, when it dissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an end; when it suggests gleams and visions, and not earthly satisfactions; when it makes the beholder feel his unworthiness; when he cannot feel his right to it, though he were Caesar; he cannot feel more right to it than to the firmament and the splendors of a sunset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同样，只有在某些时候，人体的美才会散发出无穷魅力，成为真正的美。比如，当它让我们对任何东西都挑三拣四时；当它自己变成了一个没有结局的故事时；当它不会显露出世俗的欲望，只会散发光辉和幻想时；当它使观望者意识到自身很渺小时；当观望者觉得就连凯撒也无法占有美时；当一个人觉得蓝天和落日的光辉不能被他独占时…只有在这些时候，人体的美才会成为真正的美。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hence arose the saying, "If I love you, what is that to you?" We say so, because we feel that what we love is not in your will, but above it. It is not you, but your radiance. It is that which you know not in yourself, and can never know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，有些人问：“如果我爱你，你会有什么想法呢？”这些人会这么问，是因为他们无法掌控他们所爱的东西，总感觉这些东西超出了他们的意志所能控制的范围。这种疑问，是你身上闪烁的光芒，可是你却永远都不会知道它就在你身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty which the ancient writers delighted in; for they said that the soul of man, embodied here on earth, went roaming up and down in quest of that other world of its own, out of which it came into this, but was soon stupefied by the light of the natural sun, and unable to see any other objects than those of this world, which are but shadows of real things. Therefore, the Deity sends the glory of youth before the soul, that it may avail itself of beautiful bodies as aids to its recollection of the celestial good and fair; and the man beholding such a person in the female sex runs to her, and finds the highest joy in contemplating the form, movement, and intelligence of this person, because it suggests to him the presence of that which indeed is within the beauty, and the cause of the beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种观点，与古代作家所崇尚的那种高级美学非常接近。他们认为，虽然人的灵魂存在于尘世之中，可是它却一直想知道自己的前世是什么样子的，因为它正是从前世来到尘世之中的，只是不久之后它就被阳光照得只能看到今世的事物。所以，神把青春的光彩赐予灵魂，从而使它能够在依附于美丽的肉体时也可以回忆天上的美好时光。于是，当一个男子从一个女人身上看到这种光彩时，他就会向她跑过来，并在观察这个女人的体形、动作和智慧时感到非常开心，进而意识到世间存在美的事物和美的起因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If, however, from too much conversing with material objects, the soul was gross, and misplaced its satisfaction in the body, it reaped nothing but sorrow; body being unable to fulfil the promise which beauty holds out; but if, accepting the hint of these visions and suggestions which beauty makes to his mind, the soul passes through the body, and falls to admire strokes of character, and the lovers contemplate one another in their discourses and their actions, then they pass to the true palace of beauty, more and more inflame their love of it, and by this love extinguishing the base affection, as the sun puts out the fire by shining on the hearth, they become pure and hallowed. By conversation with that which is in itself excellent, magnanimous, lowly, and just, the lover comes to a warmer love of these nobilities, and a quicker apprehension of them. Then he passes from loving them in one to loving them in all, and so is the one beautiful soul only the door through which he enters to the society of all true and pure souls. In the particular society of his mate, he attains a clearer sight of any spot, any taint, which her beauty has contracted from this world, and is able to point it out, and this with mutual joy that they are now able, without offence, to indicate blemishes and hindrances in each other, and give to each all help and comfort in curing the same. And, beholding in many souls the traits of the divine beauty, and separating in each soul that which is divine from the taint which it has contracted in the world, the lover ascends to the highest beauty, to the love and knowledge of the Divinity, by steps on this ladder of created souls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，要是灵魂与物质进行了过多的交流，灵魂就会变得粗俗不堪，并把它的需求变为对肉体欲望的满足。最后，灵魂只会令人感到悲哀，因为肉体无法完成美的承诺。但是，要是他的心灵明白了美用这些情景做的提醒，灵魂也就摆脱了肉体的束缚，怡然自得地观看性格的各种表现。至于恋人们，则会在交谈和行动中发现对方的美，由此迈入真正的美的国度，使爱的火焰在他们心中越烧越旺。这种爱，会将一切卑劣的情感之火都熄灭，就像大水浇灭炉火一样，从而使他们变得纯洁、神圣起来。情郎与那些优秀、高雅、正义、谦虚的事物交流后，会更加喜爱这些高贵的事物，并会加深对它们的理解。接着，他会把爱一个人身上的这类东西的行为，使用到所有人身上。这时候，那个美丽的灵魂就只是一扇门，引导他进入一个由纯真的灵魂构成的全新的社会。在那个全新的社会里，他能够清楚地看到所有的污秽，因为这些污秽在他爱人的美所散发的光芒下全都无所遁形。另外，他们凭着这种光芒，还能互相发现彼此身上的缺点，可是他们却不会厌恶对方的缺点，而是高兴地帮助对方改掉这些缺点。由于情郎从很多灵魂中看到了神圣的美，并且能够把它与玷污它的污秽之物区分开来，所以他才有机会踏着由纯洁的灵魂搭成的梯子登上美和知性的高峰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But this dream of love, though beautiful, is only one scene in our play. In the procession of the soul from within outward, it enlarges its circles ever, like the pebble thrown into the pond, or the light proceeding from an orb. The rays of the soul alight first on things nearest, on every utensil and toy, on nurses and domestics, on the house, and yard, and passengers, on the circle of household acquaintance, on politics, and geography, and history. But things are ever grouping themselves according to higher or more interior laws. Neighbourhood, size, numbers, habits, persons, lose by degrees their power over us. Cause and effect, real affinities, the longing for harmony between the soul and the circumstance, the progressive, idealizing instinct, predominate later, and the step backward from the higher to the lower relations is impossible. Thus even love, which is the deification of persons, must become more impersonal every day. Of this at first it gives no hint. Little think the youth and maiden who are glancing at each other across crowded rooms, with eyes so full of mutual intelligence, of the precious fruit long hereafter to proceed from this new, quite external stimulus. The work of vegetation begins first in the irritability of the bark and leaf-buds. From exchanging glances, they advance to acts of courtesy, of gallantry, then to fiery passion, to plighting troth, and marriage. Passion beholds its object as a perfect unit. The soul is wholly embodied, and the body is wholly ensouled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，这种美丽的爱之梦，只是我们的生活长剧中短暂的一幕。灵魂在从内向外前进时，不断地扩大了自己的势力范围。它所带来的影响，就像一块石头扔进池塘，或是天体发出光芒所带来的影响一样。被灵魂的光辉照射到的，首先是那些离灵魂最近的事物，然后是生活用品和玩具，还有佣人、房子、庭院、路人、亲友，以及政治、地理和历史。与此同时，事物也在更高级的规律的引导下，不断地重组自己，使自己不再受邻居、大小、数量、习惯以及别人的控制，并提升自己对因果关系、灵魂与环境和睦共处、理想等的认识。这么一来，即使是被人们奉若神明的爱，也会逐渐失去人性化。这在初期是看不出端倪的。在相邻的两个房间中，一对年轻男女在互相传达着爱意，他们心中没有隔阂，充满了对这种全新体验的期待，而很少会去想其他的。花草树木的生长，都是从茎叶的活动开始的。在互相表达自己的爱意后，那对男女会继续发展这段感情，让彼此的爱充分地燃烧，最后步入婚姻的殿堂。充满激情的眼睛，看到的是一个有机的整体。灵魂通过肉体突显自己的存在，肉体完全表达出了灵魂的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love in all ages. The doctrine is not old, nor is it new. If Plato, Plutarch, and Apuleius taught it, so have Petrarch, Angelo, and Milton. It awaits a truer unfolding in opposition and rebuke to that subterranean prudence which presides at marriages with words that take hold of the upper world, whilst one eye is prowling in the cellar, so that its gravest discourse has a savor of hams and powdering-tubs. Worst, when this sensualism intrudes into the education of young women, and withers the hope and affection of human nature, by teaching that marriage signifies nothing but a housewife's thrift, and that woman's life has no other aim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里所讲的爱，与各个时代那些真正有学识的人讲的大致相同。也就是说，这个话题既不老套也不新鲜。无论是柏拉图、普鲁塔克、阿普列乌斯，还是彼得拉克、米开朗基罗、弥尔顿，都对这一话题发表过看法。主持婚礼的人，用词非常谨慎，可是双眼却不停地搜索着什么，因此，即使他说的话很庄重、严肃，也难免会带有一种生活气息。这种所谓的谨慎行为，遭到了那些相信爱的理论的人们的反对和指责。这些人认为，爱需要由一种更浪漫的方式表达出来。这种想法是一种享乐主义，它一旦闯入青年妇女的教育领域，就会腐蚀她们身上的人性，使她们认为婚姻中只有节俭而没有希望和感情，进而使青年妇女们失去目标。如果真的出现这种情况，那就糟糕了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the lot of humanity is on these children. Danger, sorrow, and pain arrive to them, as to all. Love prays. It makes covenants with Eternal Power in behalf of this dear mate. The union which is thus effected, and which adds a new value to every atom in nature, for it transmutes every thread throughout the whole web of relation into a golden ray, and bathes the soul in a new and sweeter element, is yet a temporary state. Not always can flowers, pearls, poetry, protestations, nor even home in another heart, content the awful soul that dwells in clay. It arouses itself at last from these endearments, as toys, and puts on the harness, and aspires to vast and universal aims. The soul which is in the soul of each, craving a perfect beatitude, detects incongruities, defects, and disproportion in the behaviour of the other. Hence arise surprise, expostulation, and pain. Yet that which drew them to each other was signs of loveliness, signs of virtue; and these virtues are there, however eclipsed. They appear and reappear, and continue to attract; but the regard changes, quits the sign, and attaches to the substance. This repairs the wounded affection. Meantime, as life wears on, it proves a game of permutation and combination of all possible positions of the parties, to employ all the resources of each, and acquaint each with the strength and weakness of the other. For it is the nature and end of this relation, that they should represent the human race to each other.

<div class="line_en">The world rolls; the circumstances vary every hour. The angels that inhabit this temple of the body appear at the windows, and the gnomes and vices also. By all the virtues they are united. If there be virtue, all the vices are known as such; they confess and flee. Their once flaming regard is sobered by time in either breast, and, losing in violence what it gains in extent, it becomes a thorough good understanding. They resign each other, without complaint, to the good offices which man and woman are severally appointed to discharge in time, and exchange the passion which once could not lose sight of its object, for a cheerful, disengaged furtherance, whether present or absent, of each other's designs. At last they discover that all which at first drew them together -- -- those once sacred features, that magical play of charms, -- was deciduous, had a prospective end, like the scaffolding by which the house was built; and the purification of the intellect and the heart, from year to year, is the real marriage, foreseen and prepared from the first, and wholly above their consciousness. Looking at these aims with which two persons, a man and a woman, so variously and correlatively gifted, are shut up in one house to spend in the nuptial society forty or fifty years, I do not wonder at the emphasis with which the heart prophesies this crisis from early infancy, at the profuse beauty with which the instincts deck the nuptial bower, and nature, and intellect, and art emulate each other in the gifts and the melody they bring to the epithalamium.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus are we put in training for a love which knows not sex, nor person, nor partiality, but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere, to the end of increasing virtue and wisdom. We are by nature observers, and thereby learners. That is our permanent state. But we are often made to feel that our affections are but tents of a night. Though slowly and with pain, the objects of the affections change, as the objects of thought do. There are moments when the affections rule and absorb the man, and make his happiness dependent on a person or persons. But in health the mind is presently seen again, -- its overarching vault, bright with galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves and fears that swept over us as clouds, must lose their finite character and blend with God, to attain their own perfection. But we need not fear that we can lose any thing by the progress of the soul. The soul may be trusted to the end. That which is so beautiful and attractive as these relations must be succeeded and supplanted only by what is more beautiful, and so on for ever.</div>
