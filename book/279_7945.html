<div class="line_en">Tom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the showy character of their "regalia." He promised to abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out a new thing-namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up -- gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty–eight hours-and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high-so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking–glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend-and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once-and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however -- there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now-but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丧礼搞得颇为隆重。少年节制会的会员们神气十足地列队游行，让那位退会的会员忌妒得要死。但不管怎么说，汤姆又恢复自由这很有意义。他又可以喝酒，可以咒娘了——可是他惊奇地发现自己对这些事兴趣索然。道理很简单，他现在自由了，这些做法反而失去了魅力，他可以摆脱欲望了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment-for he was not twenty–five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就连光荣的七月四日从某种意义上说，也没那么热闹了。因为那天下了场大雨，所以没有队伍游行，而世界上最伟大的人物（在汤姆看来），一个真正的美国参议员本顿先生，令人失望——因为事实上他身高并没有二十五英尺，甚至远远挨不上这个边儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly down–town, a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature. There had been a "revival," and everybody had "got religion," not only the adults, but even the boys and girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在漫长的两周里，汤姆像个犯人似地在家躺着，与世隔绝。他病得很厉害，对什么都不感兴趣。当他终于能起身下床，虚弱无力地在镇子里走动的时候，他发现周围的人和事都发生了变化，变得压抑了。镇上有过一次“信仰复兴会”，所有的人都“信主”了，不仅是大人，男孩和女孩也不例外。汤姆到处走走，在绝望之中希望能看见哪怕一个被上帝放过的邪恶的面孔，结果处处使他失望。他发现乔·哈帕正在啃《圣经》，便难过地避开了这一扫兴场景。接着他找到了本·罗杰斯，发现他正手提一篮布道的小册子去看望穷人们。他又找到了吉姆·荷利斯，后者提醒他要从最近得的麻疹中汲取宝贵的教训。每遇到一个孩子，他的沉闷就多添一分。最后，百无聊赖之际，他去知交哈克贝利·费恩那儿寻求安慰，想不到他也引用《圣经》上的一段话来迎接他。汤姆沮丧透顶，悄悄溜回家里，躺在床上，意识到全镇人中，唯有他永远、永远地成了一只“迷途的羔羊”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在当夜，刮来了一场可怕的暴风，大雨滂沱，电闪雷呜，令人耳聩目弦。汤姆用床单蒙着头，心惊胆寒地等待着自己的末日来临。因为他一点也不怀疑，所有这一切狂风骤雨都是冲着他来的。他深信是他惹翻了上帝，使他怒不可遏，瞧，现在报应来了！在他看来，像这般用一排大炮来歼灭一只小虫，似乎有点小题大作，而且也未免太浪费弹药。但要彻底铲除像他这样的一条害虫，又似乎怎么都不为过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second was to wait-for there might not be any more storms.</div>
