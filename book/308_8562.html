<div class="line_en">"But yes. You will remember that everyone agreed -- you yourself included -- that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the house -- less if you took the short cut to the terrace. But you left the house at ten minutes to nine -- both by your own statement and that ofParker, and yet it was nine o'clock when you passed through the lodge gates. It was a chilly night -- not an evening a man would be inclined to dawdle; why had you taken ten minutes to do a five minutes' walk? All along I realized that we had only your statement for it that the study window was ever fastened. Ackroyd asked you if you had done so -- he never looked to see. Supposing, then, that the study window was unfastened? Would there be time in that ten minutes for you to run round the outside of the house, change your shoes, climb in through the window, kill Ackroyd, and get to the gate by nine o'clock? I decided against that theory since in all probability a man as nervous as Ackroyd was that night would hear you climbing in, and then there would have been a struggle. But supposing that you killed Ackroyd before you left -- as you were standing beside his chair? Then you go out of the front door, run round to the summer-house, take Ralph Paton's shoes out of the bag you brought up with you that night, slip them on, walk through the mud in them, and leave prints on the window ledge, you climb in, lock the study door on the inside, run back to the summer-house, change back into your own shoes, and race down to the gate. (I went through similar actions the other day, when you were with Mrs Ackroyd -- it took ten minutes exactly.) Then home -- and an alibi -- since you had timed the dictaphone for half-past nine."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear Poirot," I said in a voice that sounded strange and forced to my own ears, "you've been brooding over this case too long. What on earth had I to gain by murdering Ackroyd?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的波洛，”我说话的声音都变了，连自己听着都觉得奇怪，“你查案查昏头了吧。杀害艾克罗伊德到底能给我带来什么好处？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will confess to you that it was my greatest stumbling block when I found that a call had actually been put through to you from King's Abbot station. I at first believed that you had simply invented the story. It was a very clever touch, that. You must have some excuse for arriving at Fernly, finding the body, and so getting the chance to remove the dictaphone on which your alibi depended. I had a very vague notion of how it was worked when I came to see your sister that first day and inquired as to what patients you had seen on Friday morning. I had no thought of Miss Russell in my mind at that time. Her visit was a lucky coincidence, since it distracted your mind from the real object of my questions. I found what I was looking for. Among your patients that morning was the steward of an American liner. Who more suitable than he to be leaving for Liverpool by the train that evening? And afterwards he would be on the high seas, well out of the way. I noted that the Orion sailed on Saturday, and having obtained the name of the steward I sent him a wireless message asking a certain question. This is his reply you saw me receive just now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不瞒你说，当我得知确实有人从金斯艾伯特车站给你打过电话时，我才发觉这是破案的最大障碍。起初我还以为这通电话是你编造出来的。这一招实在太高明了。你必须有个借口赶去芬利庄园，发现尸体，然后伺机拿走为你建构不在场证明的口述录音机。那天我第一次去拜会你姐姐，打听星期五早晨你有哪些病人时，还没想到拉塞尔小姐也在其中。这不能不说是一个幸运的巧合，帮我掩盖了我的真正目标。我果然大有收获，那天早上你的病人当中有一位美国轮船上的乘务员。除了他，还有谁会在当晚乘火车前往利物浦？而且他很快就会乘船出海，到时去哪里找？我发现‘猎户座’号星期六起航，于是查出这位乘务员的名字，发无线电报向他求证。刚才我收到的这封电报就是他的答复。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Safety. It was you who blackmailed Mrs Ferrars. Who could have had a better knowledge of what killed Mr Ferrars than the doctor who was attending him? When you spoke to me that first day in the garden, you mentioned a legacy received about a year ago. I have been unable to discover any trace of a legacy. You had to invent some way of accounting for Mrs Ferrars's twenty thousand pounds. It has not done you much good. You lost most of it in speculation -- then you put the screw on too hard, and Mrs Ferrars took a way out that you had not expected. If Ackroyd had learnt the truth he would have had no mercy on you -- you were ruined for ever."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“安全。敲诈弗拉尔斯太太的人就是你。有谁，能比护理弗拉尔斯先生的医生更清楚他的死因？那天我们在花园里初次交谈时，你提到大约一年前继承了一笔遗产。结果经我追查，这笔钱根本来路不明。其实那只是你找了个借口解释从弗拉尔斯太太那里敲诈来的两万英镑而已。你拿了等于白拿，大部分都在投机生意中打了水漂——于是你更加残忍地压榨她，最终弗拉尔斯太太不堪忍受，采取了出乎你预料的了断方式。如果艾克罗伊德得知实情，他绝不会原谅你——你这辈子就算完了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was a clever idea," said Poirot. "The call was genuine. Your sister saw you take it. But there was only one man's word as to what was actually said -- your own!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You think not? Remember what I said -- the truth goes to Inspector Raglan in the morning. But, for the sake of your good sister, I am willing to give you the chance of another way out. There might be, for instance, an overdose of a sleeping draught. You comprehend me? But Captain Ralph Paton must be cleared -- ça va sans dire. I should suggest that you finish that very interesting manuscript of yours -- but abandoning your former reticence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？记住我的话——拉格伦警督明天一早就会知道真相。但看在你那善良的姐姐分上，我愿意为你提供另一种解决方式。比如，服用过量的安眠药。明白我的意思吗？但拉尔夫·佩顿上尉的嫌疑必须澄清——这没有商量余地。我还是建议你继续完成这份有趣的手稿，但不要像之前那样将自己撇得一干二净。”">查看中文翻译</div>
