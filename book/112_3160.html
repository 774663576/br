<div class="line_en">The morning I spotted Tony Gardner sitting among the tourists, spring was just arriving here in Venice. We'd completed our first full week outside in the piazza -- a relief, let me tell you, after all those stuffy hours performing from the back of the cafe, getting in the way of customers wanting to use the staircase. There was quite a breeze that morning, and our brand-new marquee was flapping all around us, but we were all feeling a little bit brighter and fresher, and I guess it showed in our music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现托尼·加德纳坐在游客当中的那天早上，春天刚刚降临威尼斯这里。我们搬到外面广场上来刚好一个星期——跟你说，真是松了口气，在咖啡厅的最里面演奏又闷又挡着要用楼梯的客人的路。那天早上微风习习，崭新的帐篷在我们身边啪啪作响，我们都觉得比平时更加愉悦和精神，我想这种心情一定反映在我们的音乐里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But here I am talking like I'm a regular band member. Actually, I'm one of the "gypsies," as the other musicians call us, one of the guys who move around the piazza, helping out whichever of the three cafe orchestras needs us. Mostly I play here at the Caffè Lavena, but on a busy afternoon, I might do a set with the Quadri boys, go over to the Florian, then back across the square to the Lavena. I get on fine with them all -- and with the waiters too -- and in any other city I'd have a regular position by now. But in this place, so obsessed with tradition and the past, everything's upside down. Anywhere else, being a guitar player would go in a guy's favour. But here? A guitar! The cafe managers get uneasy. It looks too modern, the tourists won't like it. Last autumn I got myself a vintage jazz model with an oval sound-hole, the kind of thing Django Reinhardt might have played, so there was no way anyone would mistake me for a rock-and-roller. That made things a little easier, but the cafe managers, they still don't like it. The truth is, if you're a guitarist, you can be Joe Pass, they still wouldn't give you a regular job in this square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瞧我说得好像我是乐队的固定成员似的。事实上，我只是那些个“吉卜赛人”中的一个，别的乐手这么称呼我们，我只是那些个奔走于广场、三个咖啡厅的管弦乐队里哪个缺人，就去哪里帮忙的人中的一个。我主要在这家拉弗娜咖啡厅演奏，但若遇上忙碌的下午，我就要先和夸德里的小伙子们演奏一组，然后到弗洛里安去，再穿过广场回到拉弗娜。我和这三支乐队都相处得很好——和咖啡厅的服务生们也是——在别的哪个城市，我早就有固定职位了。可是在这里，传统和历史根深蒂固，事情都倒过来了。在其他地方，吉他手可是受人欢迎的。可是在这里？吉他手！咖啡厅的经理们不自在了。吉他太现代了，游客不会喜欢的。去年秋天，我弄来了一把老式椭圆形音孔的爵士吉他，像强哥·莱恩哈特[1]弹的那种，这样大家就不会把我当成摇滚乐手了。事情容易了些，可经理们还是不喜欢。总之，实话告诉你吧：倘若你是个吉他手，就算你是吉他大师乔·帕斯，也甭想在这个广场找到一份固定工作。【注：[1] 二十世纪欧洲爵士吉他巨匠，吉卜赛人，出生于比利时。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's also, of course, the small matter of my not being Italian, never mind Venetian. It's the same for that big Czech guy with the alto sax. We're well liked, we're needed by the other musicians, but we don't quite fit the official bill. Just play and keep your mouth shut, that's what the cafe managers always say. That way the tourists won't know you're not Italian. Wear your suit, sunglasses, keep the hair combed back, no one will know the difference, just don't start talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然了，还有另外一个小小的原因：我不是意大利人，更别说是威尼斯人。那个吹中音萨克斯风的捷克大个子情况和我一样。大伙儿都喜欢我们，乐队需要我们，可我们就是不符合正式要求。咖啡厅的经理们总是告诉你：闭上你的嘴，只管演奏就是了。这样游客们就不会知道你不是意大利人了。穿上你的制服，戴上你的太阳镜，头发往后梳，没有人看得出来，只要别开口说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I don't do too bad. All three cafe orchestras, especially when they have to play at the same time from their rival tents, they need a guitar -- something soft, solid, but amplified, thumping out the chords from the back. I guess you're thinking, three bands playing at the same time in the same square, that would sound like a real mess. But the Piazza San Marco's big enough to take it. A tourist strolling across the square will hear one tune fade out, another fade in, like he's shifting the dial on a radio. What tourists can't take too much of is the classical stuff, all these instrumental versions of famous arias. Okay, this is San Marco, they don't want the latest pop hits. But every few minutes they want something they recognise, maybe an old Julie Andrews number, or the theme from a famous movie. I remember once last summer, going from band to band and playing "The Godfather" nine times in one afternoon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是我混得还不错。三支乐队都需要吉他手，特别是当他们与竞争对手同时演奏的时候，他们需要一个轻柔、纯净，但是传得远的声音作背景和弦。我猜你会想：三支乐队同时在一个广场上演奏，听起来多混乱啊。可是圣马可广场很大，没有问题。在广场上溜达的游客会听见一个曲子渐渐消失，另一个曲子渐渐大声，就好像他在调收音机的台。会让游客们受不了的是你演奏太多古典的东西，这些乐器演奏版的著名咏叹调。得了，这里是圣马可，游客们不想听最新的流行音乐。可是他们时不时要一些他们认得的东西，比如朱莉·安德鲁斯[2]的老歌，或者某个著名电影的主题曲。我记得去年夏天有一次，我奔走于各个乐队间，一个下午演奏了九遍《教父》。【注：[2] 英国著名电影和舞台剧演员、歌唱家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway there we were that spring morning, playing in front of a good crowd of tourists, when I saw Tony Gardner, sitting alone with his coffee, almost directly in front of us, maybe six metres back from our marquee. We get famous people in the square all the time, we never make a fuss. At the end of a number, maybe a quiet word will go around the band members. Look, there's Warren Beatty. Look, it's Kissinger. That woman, she's the one who was in the movie about the men who swap their faces. We're used to it. This is the Piazza San Marco after all. But when I realised it was Tony Gardner sitting there, that was different. I did get excited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之就是在这样一个春天的早晨，当我们在一大群游客面前演出的时候，我突然看见托尼·加德纳，独自一人坐在那里，面前放着一杯咖啡，差不多就在我们的正前方，离我们的帐篷大概只有六米远。广场上总是能看见名人，我们从来不大惊小怪。只在演奏完一曲后，乐队成员间私下小声说几句。看，是沃伦·比蒂[3]。看，是基辛格。那个女人就是在讲两个男人变脸的电影里出现过的那个。我们对此习以为常。毕竟这里是圣马可广场。可是当我发现坐在那里的是托尼·加德纳时，情况就不一样了，我激动极了。【注：[3] 美国著名演员、导演。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tony Gardner had been my mother's favourite. Back home, back in the communist days, it had been really hard to get records like that, but my mother had pretty much his whole collection. Once when I was a boy, I scratched one of those precious records. The apartment was so cramped, and a boy my age, you just had to move around sometimes, especially during those cold months when you couldn't go outside. So I was playing this game jumping from our little sofa to the armchair, and one time I misjudged it and hit the record player. The needle went across the record with a zip -- this was long before CDs -- and my mother came in from the kitchen and began shouting at me. I felt so bad, not just because she was shouting at me, but because I knew it was one of Tony Gardner's records, and I knew how much it meant to her. And I knew that this one too would now have those popping noises going through it while he crooned those American songs. Years later, when I was working in Warsaw and I got to know about black-market records, I gave my mother replacements of all her worn-out Tony Gardner albums, including that one I scratched. It took me over three years, but I kept getting them, one by one, and each time I went back to see her I'd bring her another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托尼·加德纳是我母亲最喜爱的歌手。在我离开家之前，在那个共产主义时代，那样的唱片是很难弄到的，可我母亲有他几乎所有的唱片。小时候我刮坏过一张母亲的珍贵收藏。我们住的公寓很挤，可像我那个年纪的男孩子有时就是好动，尤其是在冬天不能出去的时候。所以我就从家里的小沙发跳到扶手椅上这样玩，有一次，我不小心撞到了唱片机。唱针“嗞”的一声划过唱片——那时还没有CD——母亲从厨房里出来，冲我大声嚷嚷。我很伤心，不是因为她冲我大声嚷嚷，而是因为我知道那是托尼·加德纳的唱片，我知道那张唱片对她来说多么重要。我还知道从此以后，当加德纳轻声吟唱那些美国歌曲时，唱片就会发出“嗞嗞”的声音。多年以后，我在华沙工作时得知了黑市唱片，我给母亲买了所有的托尼·加德纳的唱片，代替旧的那些，包括我刮坏的那一张。我花了三年才买齐，可我坚持不懈地买，一张张地买，每次回去看望她都带回去一张。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So you see why I got so excited when I recognised him, barely six metres away. At first I couldn't quite believe it, and I might have been a beat late with a chord change. Tony Gardner! What would my dear mother have said if she'd known! For her sake, for the sake of her memory, I had to go and say something to him, never mind if the other musicians laughed and said I was acting like a bell-boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在你知道当我认出托尼·加德纳时为什么会那么激动了吧，就在六米以外啊。起初我不敢相信，我换一个和弦时一定慢了一拍。是托尼·加德纳！我亲爱的母亲要是知道了会说什么啊！为了她，为了她的回忆，我一定要去跟托尼·加德纳说句话，才不管其他乐手会不会笑话我，说我像个小听差。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But of course I couldn't just rush over to him, pushing aside the tables and chairs. There was our set to finish. It was agony, I can tell you, another three, four numbers, and every second I thought he was about to get up and walk off. But he kept sitting there, by himself, staring into his coffee, stirring it like he was really puzzled by what the waiter had brought him. He looked like any other American tourist, dressed in a pale-blue polo shirt and loose grey trousers. His hair, very dark, very shiny on those record covers, was almost white now, but there was still plenty of it, and it was immaculately groomed in the same style he'd had back then. When I'd first spotted him, he'd had his dark glasses in his hand -- I doubt if I'd have recognised him otherwise -- but as our set went on and I kept watching him, he put them on his face, took them off again, then back on again. He looked preoccupied and it disappointed me to see he wasn't really listening to our music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我当然不可能推开桌椅，朝他冲过去。我还得把演出演完。跟你说，真是痛苦极了，还有三四首歌，每一秒钟我都以为他要起身离开了。可是他一直坐在那里，独自一人，盯着眼前的咖啡，搅呀搅，好像搞不清楚服务生给他端来的到底是什么东西。他的装扮与一般的美国游客一样，浅蓝色的套头运动衫、宽松的灰裤子。以前唱片封面上又黑又亮的头发如今几乎都白了，但还挺浓密，而且梳得整整齐齐，发型也没有变。我刚认出他时，他把墨镜拿在手里——他要是戴着墨镜我不一定能认出来——但是后来我一边演奏一边盯着他，他一会儿把墨镜戴上，一会儿拿下来，一会儿又戴上。他看上去心事重重，而且没有认真在听我们演奏，让我很是失望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then our set was over. I hurried out of the tent without saying anything to the others, made my way to Tony Gardner's table, then had a moment's panic not knowing how to start the conversation. I was standing behind him, but some sixth sense made him turn and look up at me -- I guess it was all those years of having fans come up to him -- and next thing I was introducing myself, explaining how much I admired him, how I was in the band he'd just been listening to, how my mother had been such a fan, all in one big rush. He listened with a grave expression, nodding every few seconds like he was my doctor. I kept talking and all he said every now and then was: "Is that so?"

The Inimitable Tony Gardner." I think we were both really enjoying this game, but then I noticed Mr. Gardner's gaze move off me, and I turned just in time to see a woman coming up to our table.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wasn't angry, but his mood seemed grave and solemn -- not at all romantic. Behind him was the gondola, gently rocking in the water, and I saw the gondolier was Vittorio, a guy I don't like much. To my face, Vittorio's always friendly, but I know -- I knew back then -- he goes around saying all kinds of foul things, all of it rubbish, about people like me, people he calls "the foreigners from the new countries." That's why, when he greeted me that evening like a brother, I just nodded, and waited silently while he helped Mr. Gardner into the gondola.

Every table seemed taken, the waiters were rushing about, the diners looked very happy, even though it couldn't have been so warm next to the canal at that time of year. After the quiet and the darkness we'd been travelling through, the restaurant was kind of unsettling.

<div class="line_en">Maybe Vittorio's thoughts were moving along the same lines, because as we passed under a lantern on the side of a wall, he gave me a look as though to say: "We've got a strange one here, haven't we, amico?" But I didn't respond. I wasn't going to side with the likes of him against Mr. Gardner. According to Vittorio, foreigners like me, we go around ripping off tourists, littering the canals, in general ruining the whole damn city. Some days, if he's in a bad mood, he'll claim we're muggers -- rapists, even. I asked him once to his face if it was true he was going around saying such things, and he swore it was all a pack of lies. How could he be a racist when he had a Jewish aunt he adored like a mother? But one afternoon I was killing time between sets, leaning over a bridge in Dorsoduro, and a gondola passed underneath. There were three tourists sitting in it, and Vittorio standing over them with his oar, holding forth for the world to hear, coming out with this very same rubbish.

<div class="line_en">"Let me tell you a little secret," Mr. Gardner said suddenly. "A little secret about performance. One pro to another. It's quite simple. You've got to know something, doesn't matter what it is, you've got to know something about your audience. Something that for you, in your mind, distinguishes that audience from the one you sang to the night before. Let's say you're in Milwaukee. You've got to ask yourself, what's different, what's special about a Milwaukee audience? What makes it different from a Madison audience? Can't think of anything, you just keep on trying till you do. Milwaukee, Milwaukee. They have good pork chops in Milwaukee. That'll work, that's what you use when you step out there. You don't have to say a word about it to them, it's what's in your mind when you sing to them. These people in front of you, they're the ones who eat good pork chops. They have high standards when it comes to pork chops. You understand what I'm saying? That way the audience becomes someone you know, someone you can perform to. There, that's my secret. One pro to another."</div>

You've got to understand, these were serious girls, really ambitious, determined girls. Did they talk about clothes and shoes and make-up like other girls? Sure they did. But they only talked about which clothes and shoes and make-up would help them marry a star. Did they talk about movies? Did they talk about the music scene? You bet. But they talked about which movie stars and singers were single, which ones were unhappily married, which ones were getting divorced. And Meg, you see, she could tell them all this, and much, much more. Meg had been down that road before them. She knew all the rules, all the tricks, when it came to marrying a star.

She could tell them all the stories and those girls listened. And some of them learned. Lindy, for one. Like I say, that was her Harvard. It made her what she is. It gave her the strength she needed later on, and boy, did she need it. It took her six years before her first break came along. Can you imagine it? Six years of manoeuvring, planning, putting yourself on the line like that. Getting knocked back over and over again. But it's just like in our business. You can't roll over and give up after the first few knocks. The girls who do, you can see them any place, married to nobodies in nowhere towns. But just a few of them, the ones like Lindy, they learn from every knock, they come back stronger, tougher, they come back fighting and mad. You think Lindy didn't suffer humiliation?

<div class="line_en">"Me? No, no. I didn't come on the scene for a while longer. She married Dino Hartman. You've never heard of Dino?" Mr. Gardner did a slightly unkind laugh here. "Poor Dino. I guess Dino's records wouldn't have made it to the communist countries. But Dino had quite a name for himself in those days. He sang in Vegas a lot, had a few gold records. Like I said, that was Lindy's big break. When I first met her, she was Dino's wife. Old Meg had explained that's how it happens all the time. Sure, a girl can get lucky first time, go straight to the top, marry a Sinatra or a Brando. But it doesn't usually happen like that. A girl's got to be prepared to get out of the elevator at the second floor, walk around. She needs to get used to the air on that floor. Then maybe, one day, on that second floor, she'll run into someone who's come down from the penthouse for a few minutes, maybe to fetch something. And this guy says to her, hey, how about coming back up with me, up to the top floor. Lindy knew that's how it usually played out. She wasn't weakening when she married Dino, she wasn't cutting her ambition down to size. And Dino was a decent guy. I always liked him. That's why, even though I fell badly for Lindy the moment I first saw her, I didn't make a move. I was the perfect gentleman. I found out later that was what made Lindy all the more determined. Man, you've got to admire a girl like that! I have to tell you, friend, I was a bright, bright star around this time. I guess this would be around when your mother was listening to me. Dino, though, his star was starting to go down fast. It was tough for a lot of singers just around then. Everything was changing. Kids were listening to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones. Poor Dino, he sounded too much like Bing Crosby. He tried a bossa nova album folks just laughed at. Definitely time for Lindy to get out. No one could have accused us of anything in that situation. I don't think even Dino really blamed us. So I made my move. That's how she got up to the penthouse."</div>

So we go in, and we can hear the maid vacuuming our lounge, but we can't see her, she's through the partition. So we sneak through on tip-toes, like we're kids, you know? We sneak through to the bedroom, close the door. We can see the maid's finished the bedroom already, so maybe she doesn't need to come back, but we don't know that for sure.

But my mother, she never stopped believing it. And every time she felt down, maybe like you are tonight, you know what she did? She put on your records and sang along. All those long winters, in that tiny apartment of ours, she'd sit there, knees tucked up under her, glass of something in her hand, and she'd sing along softly. And sometimes, I remember this, Mr. Gardner, our neighbours upstairs would bang on the ceiling, especially when you were doing those big up-tempo numbers, like 'High Hopes' or 'They All Laughed.' I used to watch my mother carefully, but it was like she hadn't heard a thing, she'd be listening to you, nodding her head to the beat, her lips moving with the lyrics. Mr. Gardner, I wanted to say to you. Your music helped my mother through those times, it must have helped millions of others. And it's only right it should help you too." I did a little laugh, which I meant to be encouraging, but it came out louder than I'd intended. "You can count on me tonight, Mr. Gardner. I'm going to put everything I've got into it. I'll make it as good as any orchestra, you just see. And Mrs. Gardner will hear us and who knows? Maybe things will start going fine between you again.

I tried to make it sound like America, sad roadside bars, big long highways, and I guess I was thinking too of my mother, the way I'd come into the room and see her on the sofa gazing at her record sleeve with its picture of an American road, or maybe of the singer sitting in an American car.

<div class="line_en">Then before I realised it, before I'd picked up any steady beat, Mr. Gardner started to sing. His posture, standing in the gondola, was pretty unsteady, and I was afraid he'd lose his balance any moment. But his voice came out just the way I remembered it -- gentle, almost husky, but with a huge amount of body, like it was coming through an invisible mike. And like all the best American singers, there was that weariness in his voice, even a hint of hesitation, like he's not a man accustomed to laying open his heart this way. That's how all the greats do it.</div>

But twenty-seven years of marriage can do funny things. Plenty of couples, they start off loving each other, then get tired of each other, end up hating each other. Sometimes though it goes the other way. It took a few years, but bit by bit, Lindy began to love me. I didn't dare believe it at first, but after a while there was nothing else to believe. A little touch on my shoulder as we were getting up from a table. A funny little smile across the room when there wasn't anything to smile about, just her fooling around. I bet she was as surprised as anyone, but that's what happened. After five or six years, we found we were easy with each other. That we worried about each other, cared about each other. Like I say, we loved each other. And we still love each other today."</div>
