<div class="line_en">Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her formerfavourite. She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of hisimputed guilt; -- she was sorry for him; -- she wished him happy. But thefeelings of the past could not be recalled. -- Nothing could restore himwith a faith unbroken-a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothingcould do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through hismeans, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothingcould replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure theinterests of Colonel Brandon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story fromhimself-had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influenceof his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassionwould have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor inher wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailedexplanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflectionhad given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion ofWilloughby's deserts; -- she wished, therefore, to declare only thesimple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to hischaracter, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancyastray.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You consider the matter," said Elinor, "exactly as a good mind and asound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, aswell as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved youin many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would havebeen poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain. Had you married, you must have been always poor. His expensiveness isacknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares thatself-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His demands and yourinexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have broughton distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from havingbeen entirely unknown and unthought of before. YOUR sense of honourand honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that-and howlittle could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruinwhich had begun before your marriage? -- Beyond THAT, had youendeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it notto be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish toconsent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in suchdifficulties?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你考虑问题，”埃丽诺说，“和一个有头脑、有见识的人应该做的完全一样。大概你和我一样，不只从这一事件，还从许多其他事件里悟出了—定的道理，以至于认识到：你若是同他结了婚，肯定会陷入重重困难，感到百般失望。在这种情况下，凭着他那反复无常的感情，那是维持不下去的。你倘若结了婚，肯定一直是个穷光蛋。他花起钱来大手大脚，这连他自己也供认不讳。他的整个行为表明，他简直不知道什么叫自我节制。就凭着那么一点点收入，他的需求量那么大，你又缺乏经验，一定会引起不少痛苦。这些痛苦决不会因为你事先完全没有想到而减轻几分。我知道，你一旦认识到自己的处境，你的自尊和诚实感会促使你厉行节约。也许，当你只是对自己节衣缩食的时候，你还可以尽量节省，但是超出这个限度，—─况且，你就是一个人节省到最大限度，你也无法阻止你们结婚前就已开始的倾家荡产！超出这个限度，假如你试图要减少他的物质享受，也不管多么合情合理，难道你就不担心，你非但不能说服具有如此自私之心的人表示赞同，反而会使你驾驭不住他的心，让他后悔不该和你结婚，认为和你结婚才使他陷入这样的困境？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The whole of his behaviour," replied Elinor, "from the beginning tothe end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It wasselfishness which first made him sport with your affections; whichafterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession ofit, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment, orhis own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的整个行为，”埃丽诺答道，“自始至终都建立在自私的基础上。正因为自私，他先是玩弄了你的感情——后来，当他自己也倾心于你的时候，又迟迟不肯表白，最后又离开了巴顿。他自己的享乐，他自己的安适，这是他高于一切的指导原则。”，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word "Selfish?" in atone that implied --"do you really think him selfish?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安的嘴唇颤抖了一下，她重复了一声“自私”这两个字，听语气意思是说：“你真认为他自私吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets what he has done. And whydoes he regret it? -- Because he finds it has not answered towardshimself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are nowunembarrassed-he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks onlythat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself. But does it follow that had he married you, he would have beenhappy? -- The inconveniences would have been different. He would thenhave suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they areremoved, he now reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of whosetemper he could make no complaint, but he would have been alwaysnecessitous-always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rankthe innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of farmore importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of awife."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，”埃丽诺接下去说，“他对自己的所作所为感到懊悔。他为什么要懊悔呢？因为他发现事情不合他的心意，没使他感到幸福，他现在的境况并不窘迫——他还没有遭到这样的不幸，他只是觉得他娶了一个性情不及你温存的女人。然而，这是不是意味着他娶了你就会幸福呢？那会出现别的麻烦。他会为金钱问题感到苦恼。目前只是因为不存在这个问题，他才认为无所谓，他本来想娶一个性情上无可指摘的妻子，但是那样一来他会永远陷入贫困。他也许很快就会觉得：即使对家庭幸福来说，一宗不纳税的田产和一笔可观的收入能带来无穷无尽的物质享受，要比妻子的脾气重要得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，从整个事件中可以公平地得出—个结论——威洛比的—切麻烦都起因于他最初对伊丽莎。威廉斯的不道德行为。这一罪恶是他一切较小罪过的根源，也是他现在满腹怨艾的根源。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and thetablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed. Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more. Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaretmight think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as bothher sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had oftenhad to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to gowithout her dinner before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达什伍德太太想不起别的问题了，托马斯也好，台布也好，现在都不需要了，她便立即让他拿走了。玛丽安早就打发人来说过，她不想吃饭。达什伍德太太和埃丽诺同样没有胃口。玛格丽特或许会觉得，两个姐姐最近搞得心神不定，总是有那么多理由动不动就不吃饭，她自己倒真够幸运，还从来没有迫不得已挨过饿呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood andElinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in asimilarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared tohazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She nowfound that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation ofherself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expresslysoftened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne. She found that shehad been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of herdaughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so wellunderstood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont tobelieve, or than it was now proved to be. She feared that under thispersuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to herElinor; -- that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, moreimmediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and ledher away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter sufferingalmost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greaterfortitude.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等甜点和酒摆上桌，桌前只剩下达什伍德太太和埃丽诺两个人。她们在一起呆了很长时间，都在沉思默想，达什伍德太太唯恐出言有失，不敢贸然安慰女儿。她现在发现，她过去相信埃丽诺的自我说明是错误的。她得出这样的公正结论：因为她当时已经为玛丽安吃尽了苦头，为了不给她增添痛苦，埃丽诺显然把一切都作了轻描淡写。她发现，她本来很了解埃丽诺和爱德华之间的感情，但是埃丽诺的小心体贴使她得出了错误的结论，认为他们的感情实际上比她原先想象的淡薄得多，也比现在所证实的淡薄得多。她担心，照这样说来，她对她的埃丽诺有失公道，有失体谅——不，简直有失仁慈，──玛丽安的痛苦，因为她认识到了，而旦就摆在她的眼前，便使她深情倾注，从而忘记埃丽诺可能忍受着同样大的痛苦，当然只不过她更能克制，更有毅力罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
