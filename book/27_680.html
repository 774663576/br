<div class="line_en">Tim Kemp had good news for his team. The former IBM executive was in charge of bioinformatics at Theranos, a startup with a cutting-edge blood-testing system. The company had just completed its first big live demonstration for a pharmaceutical company. Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos's twenty-two-year-old founder, had flown to Switzerland and shown off the system's capabilities to executives at Novartis, the European drug giant.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Elizabeth called me this morning," Kemp wrote in an email to his fifteen-person team. "She expressed her thanks and said that, 'it was perfect!' She specifically asked me to thank you and let you all know her appreciation.

<div class="line_cn" title="展示成功的消息，一路传到高端主管办公室所在的二楼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of those executives was Henry Mosley, Theranos's chief financial officer. Mosley had joined Theranos eight months earlier, in March 2006. A rumpled dresser with piercing green eyes and a laid-back personality, he was a veteran of Silicon Valley's technology scene. After growing up in the Washington, D. C., area and getting his MBA at the University of Utah, he'd come out to California in the late 1970s and never left. His first job was at chipmaker Intel, one of the Valley's pioneers. He'd later gone on to run the finance departments of four different tech companies, taking two of them public. Theranos was far from his first rodeo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一位高端主管是亨利．莫斯利（Henry Mosley），Theranos的财务长，八个月前才加入，也就是二〇〇六年三月。莫斯利穿着一身皱皱的衣服，绿色双眼透着洞悉一切的锐利，个性不疾不徐，是硅谷科技圈的老鸟。成长于华盛顿特区的他，在犹他大学（University of Utah）取得MBA，随后在一九七〇年代末期来到加州，从此没离开。他第一份工作是在芯片制造商英特尔（Intel，硅谷的先驱之一），后来陆续掌管四家科技公司的财务部门，带领其中两家股票上市。Theranos绝对不是他的第一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What had drawn Mosley to Theranos was the talent and experience gathered around Elizabeth. She might be young, but she was surrounded by an all-star cast. The chairman of her board was Donald L. Lucas, the venture capitalist who had groomed billionaire software entrepreneur Larry Ellison and helped him take Oracle Corporation public in the mid-1980s. Lucas and Ellison had both put some of their own money into Theranos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫斯利之所以加入Theranos，是冲着聚集在伊莉莎白身边的人才和经验。尽管伊莉莎白很年轻，身边围绕的人却尽是闪耀的明星。她的董事长是唐纳．卢卡斯（Donald L. Lucas），一九八〇年代中期栽培出身价亿万美元的软件创业家赖瑞．艾利森（Larry Ellison），协助艾利森带领甲骨文公司（Oracle Corporation）股票上市。而卢卡斯和艾利森也拿出自己的钱投资Theranos。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another board member with a sterling reputation was Channing Robertson, the associate dean of Stanford's School of Engineering. Robertson was one of the stars of the Stanford faculty. His expert testimony about the addictive properties of cigarettes had forced the tobacco industry to enter into a landmark $6.5 billion settlement with the state of Minnesota in the late 1990s. Based on the few interactions Mosley had had with him, it was clear Robertson thought the world of Elizabeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="董事会还有位名号响叮当的成员——钱宁．罗伯森（Channing Robertson），史丹佛工学院副院长。罗伯森是史丹佛的明星师资之一，一九九〇年代末期，由于他的专业证词：香烟具有令人上瘾的特性，使烟草业者不得不跟明尼苏达州达成指针性的天价和解（六十五亿美元）。根据莫斯利少数几次跟罗伯森的交互，罗伯森对伊莉莎白有很高的评价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theranos also had a strong management team. Kemp had spent thirty years at IBM. Diane Parks, Theranos's chief commercial officer, had twenty-five years of experience at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. John Howard, the senior vice president for products, had overseen Panasonic's chip-making subsidiary. It wasn't often that you found executives of that caliber at a small startup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，Theranos的管理团队也很坚强。坎普在IBM待了三十年，商务长黛安．帕克斯（Diane Parks）在药厂和生技公司有二十五年经验，产品资深副总约翰．郝尔德（John Howard）以前在Panasonic掌管制造芯片的子公司。小小的新创公司就能网罗如此等级的高端经理人，实属罕见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't just the board and the executive team that had sold Mosley on Theranos, though. The market it was going after was huge. Pharmaceutical companies spent tens of billions of dollars on clinical trials to test new drugs each year. If Theranos could make itself indispensable to them and capture a fraction of that spending, it could make a killing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过令莫斯利买单的，并不只是董事会成员和高端管理团队。Theranos锁定的市场非常庞大，各大药厂每年花在新药临床试验的金额高达数百亿美元，若是能成为药厂不可或缺的伙伴，只要分到那笔金额的一小部分，就赚翻了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth had asked him to put together some financial projections she could show investors. The first set of numbers he'd come up with hadn't been to her liking, so he'd revised them upward. He was a little uncomfortable with the revised numbers, but he figured they were in the realm of the plausible if the company executed perfectly. Besides, the venture capitalists startups courted for funding knew that startup founders overstated these forecasts. It was part of the game. VCs even had a term for it: the hockey-stick forecast. It showed revenue stagnating for a few years and then magically shooting up in a straight line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白要求莫斯利整理一些财务估算，以便她拿给投资人看。莫斯利第一次提供的数字不合她意，于是他向上做了调整。调整过的数字让他有点不安，但他心想，只要公司每件事都运行得很完美，这样的数字还算在合理范围内。况且，创投（venture-capital）业者也心知肚明，想方设法取得资金的新创公司往往会夸大预估，这是游戏的一部分。创投甚至对此有个术语：曲棍球杆（hockey-stick）预估，意指像曲棍球杆的形状一样，营收先是停滞好几年，然后奇迹似直线窜升。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The one thing Mosley wasn't sure he completely understood was how the Theranos technology worked. When prospective investors came by, he took them to see Shaunak Roy, Theranos's cofounder. Shaunak had a Ph. D. in chemical engineering. He and Elizabeth had worked together in Robertson's research lab at Stanford.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫斯利不确定自己是否完全了解的部分是：Theranos的技术到底可不可行。每当有潜在投资人上门，他便带他们去找萧内克．罗伊（Shaunak Roy），Theranos的共同创办人。萧内克是化工博士，曾在史丹佛和伊莉莎白于罗伯森的实验室共事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shaunak would prick his finger and milk a few drops of blood from it. Then he would transfer the blood to a white plastic cartridge the size of a credit card. The cartridge would slot into a rectangular box the size of a toaster. The box was called a reader. It extracted a data signal from the cartridge and beamed it wirelessly to a server that analyzed the data and beamed back a result. That was the gist of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萧内克会将自己的手指扎出几滴血，然后滴到一个信用卡大小的白色塑胶匣，接着把塑胶匣插入如烤面包机大小的长方形盒子里。这个盒子称为「读卡机」，可以提取出塑胶匣的数据信号，再用无线方式将信号发送给服务器，由服务器分析数据后再将结果发送回来。大致是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Shaunak demonstrated the system to investors, he pointed them to a computer screen that showed the blood flowing through the cartridge inside the reader.

<div class="line_cn" title="当萧内克为投资人示范这套系统时，会指着电脑屏幕，屏幕上显示血液流过读卡机内的塑胶匣。其实，莫斯利并不理解其中的物理或化学原理，但这不关他的事，他是财务人员，只要这套系统能成功显示结果，他就很高兴，而每次也都有结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth was back from Switzerland a few days later. She sauntered around with a smile on her face, more evidence that the trip had gone well, Mosley figured. Not that that was unusual. Elizabeth was often upbeat. She had an entrepreneur's boundless optimism. She liked to use the term "extra-ordinary," with "extra" written in italics and a hyphen for emphasis, to describe the Theranos mission in her emails to staff. It was a bit over the top, but she seemed sincere and Mosley knew that evangelizing was what successful startup founders did in Silicon Valley. You didn't change the world by being cynical.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，伊莉莎白从瑞士返回，脸上挂着微笑、四处闲晃。莫斯利心想，这更加证明瑞士之行非常顺利。倒不是说这样的她很不寻常，她是个积极乐观的人，具有创业家无上限的乐观，喜欢在写给员工的信里用「extra-ordinary」（非常不凡）来形容公司使命，「extra」（非常）还特别用斜体字再加上连字符号来强调。这的确有点过头，但似乎真的发自内心，而莫斯利也很清楚，硅谷成功的创业家都如同传福音般报喜不报忧，愤世嫉俗是无法改变世界的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was odd, though, was that the handful of colleagues who'd accompanied Elizabeth on the trip didn't seem to share her enthusiasm. Some of them looked outright downcast.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wandered downstairs, where most of the company's sixty employees sat in clusters of cubicles, and looked for Shaunak. Surely Shaunak would know if there was any problem he hadn't been told about.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, Shaunak professed not to know anything. But Mosley sensed he was holding back and kept pressing him. Shaunak gradually let down his guard and allowed that the Theranos 1.0, as Elizabeth had christened the blood-testing system, didn't always work. It was kind of a crapshoot, actually, he said. Sometimes you could coax a result from it and sometimes you couldn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萧内克起初谎称自己什么都不知道，不过莫斯利感觉他有所隐瞒，不断追问下，他才逐渐卸下心防，承认Theranos 1.0（这是伊莉莎白给这套血液检测系统取的名字）并不是每次都能用。他说，其实有点像掷骰子，要碰运气，有时会出现结果，有时不行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was news to Mosley. He thought the system was reliable. Didn't it always seem to work when investors came to view it?</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, there was a reason it always seemed to work, Shaunak said. The image on the computer screen showing the blood flowing through the cartridge and settling into the little wells was real. But you never knew whether you were going to get a result or not. So they'd recorded a result from one of the times it worked. It was that recorded result that was displayed at the end of each demo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呃…每次「看起来都运作得好好的」，背后其实是有原因的，萧内克说道。电脑屏幕上出现的影像是真的——血液流过塑胶匣，流入一个像井一样的小信道——但是有没有结果就不得而知了。于是他们预先录下某次有结果的检测，在每次展示的最后出现的结果就是事先录好的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mosley was stunned. He thought the results were extracted in real time from the blood inside the cartridge. That was certainly what the investors he brought by were led to believe. What Shaunak had just described sounded like a sham. It was OK to be optimistic and aspirational when you pitched investors, but there was a line not to cross. And this, in Mosley's view, crossed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫斯利听得目瞪口呆。他以为检测结果是即时从塑胶匣里的血液提取出来，而他带来参观的投资人当然都这么以为。萧内克刚刚所描述的情况，听起来就像一场骗局。你可以用满满的乐观向投资人推销，也可以不掩饰你对成功的饥渴，但这中间有一条不能跨过的线。而现在，在莫斯利看来，已经跨过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, what exactly had happened with Novartis?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，诺华那边到底发生了什么事？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mosley couldn't get a straight answer from anyone, but he now suspected some similar sleight of hand. And he was right. One of the two readers Elizabeth took to Switzerland had malfunctioned when they got there. The employees she brought with her had stayed up all night trying to get it to work. To mask the problem during the demo the next morning, Tim Kemp's team in California had beamed over a fake result.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫斯利无法从任何人口中得到老实的答案，不过现在他开始怀疑诺华的展示会上动了同样手脚。他的猜想果然没错，伊莉莎白带到瑞士的两台读卡机在一抵达就故障了，跟她一同前往的员工整晚没睡、努力抢修。隔天早上展示时，为了掩饰这个问题，提姆．坎普在加州的团队传了假的检测结果过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mosley Had a weekly meeting with Elizabeth scheduled for that afternoon. When he entered her office, he was immediately reminded of her charisma. She had the presence of someone much older than she was. The way she trained her big blue eyes on you without blinking made you feel like the center of the world. It was almost hypnotic. Her voice added to the mesmerizing effect: she spoke in an unusually deep baritone.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Mosley decided to let the meeting run its natural course before bringing up his concerns. Theranos had just closed its third round of funding. By any measure, it was a resounding success: the company had raised another $32 million from investors, on top of the $15 million raised in its first two funding rounds. The most impressive number was its new valuation: one hundred and sixty-five million dollars. There weren't many three-year-old startups that could say they were worth that much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫斯利决定先按捺下疑虑，让会议顺其自然进行。Theranos刚结束第三轮募资，不管从什么标准来看都是不同凡响的成功：前两轮向投资人募到一千五百万美元，第三轮又募到三千二百万美元。这些数字还不算什么，最惊人的是Theranos最新估值——一亿六千五百万美元！没有多少成立三年的新创公司，敢说自己值这么多钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One big reason for the rich valuation was the agreements Theranos told investors it had reached with pharmaceutical partners. A slide deck listed six deals with five companies that would generate revenues of $120 million to $300 million over the next eighteen months. It listed another fifteen deals under negotiation. If those came to fruition, revenues could eventually reach $1.5 billion, according to the PowerPoint presentation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之所以有这么高的估值，一大原因是Theranos告诉投资人它已经跟几家药厂达成合作协议。根据一份演示文稿，其中一张投影片列出Theranos已和五家公司谈妥六笔交易，未来一年半可衍生一亿二千万至三亿美元的营收；此外，还列出十五笔正在谈判的交易，如果都成功敲定，营收可望达到十五亿美元。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pharmaceutical companies were going to use Theranos's blood-testing system to monitor patients' response to new drugs. The cartridges and readers would be placed in patients' homes during clinical trials. Patients would prick their fingers several times a day and the readers would beam their blood-test results to the trial's sponsor. If the results indicated a bad reaction to the drug, the drug's maker would be able to lower the dosage immediately rather than wait until the end of the trial. This would reduce pharmaceutical companies' research costs by as much as 30 percent. Or so the slide deck said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="制药公司将会采用Theranos的血液检测系统，来监控病人对新药的反应。进行药物临床试验时，塑胶匣和读卡机会放置在病人家中，患者每天自己扎手指几次，再由读卡机将他们的血液检测结果，发送给委托临床试验的药厂。若结果显示药物反应不佳，药厂立刻就能减少剂量，不必等到试验结束。如此一来，药厂的研发成本足足可降低三成之多。投影片上大致是这么说的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mosley's unease with all these claims had grown since that morning's discovery. For one thing, in his eight months at Theranos, he'd never laid eyes on the pharmaceutical contracts. Every time he inquired about them, he was told they were "under legal review." More important, he'd agreed to those ambitious revenue forecasts because he thought the Theranos system worked reliably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从有了早上的发现，莫斯利开始对以上这些说法愈来愈不安。一来，从他进入公司至今八个月，他从未看过任何药厂合约，每次他问起，总是被告知「法务部门正在审阅中」。更重要的是，他之所以同意做出那些深具野心的营收预估，全是因为他以为公司的系统是准确可靠的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If Elizabeth shared any of these misgivings, she showed no signs of it. She was the picture of a relaxed and happy leader.
