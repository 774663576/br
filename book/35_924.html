<div class="line_en">They had been right about the bridge, but on spotting the soldiers there, had decided to rest amidst the pine trees until the men had gone. For at first the soldiers had not appeared to be stationed there, but merely refreshing themselves and their horses at the waterfall. But time had passed and the soldiers had shown no signs of moving on. They would take turns getting onto their bellies, reaching down from the bridge and splashing themselves; or sit with their backs against the timber rails, playing dice. Then a fourth man had arrived on horseback, bringing the men to their feet, and had issued instructions to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a punishing climb for much of the morning, the party had found its way obstructed by a fast-flowing river.

<div class="line_en">"I'm sure that's so," the warrior said, then fell silent for a moment, gazing down at the bridge. The soldiers had seated themselves again and seemed to be resuming their game. "Even so," he went on, "if we're to cross the bridge under their gazes, let me propose this much. Master Axl, you and Mistress Beatrice will lead the way and talk wisely to the men. The boy can bring the mare behind you, and I'll walk beside him, my jaw slack like a fool's, my eyes wandering loosely. You must tell the soldiers I'm a mute and a half-wit, and the boy and I are brothers lent you in place of debts owed you. I'll hide this sword and belt deep in the horse's pack. Should they find it, you must claim it as your own."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信是这样。”武士说完，沉默了一会儿，眼睛望着桥。士兵们又坐了下来，好像在接着玩游戏。“但是，”武士继续说道，“如果我们要在他们的监视之下过桥，请允许我提个建议。埃克索阁下，你和比特丽丝先走，和那些人好好谈谈。这个男孩可以牵着马在后面跟着，我和他并肩走，我会下巴像傻瓜一样耷拉下来，眼神散乱。你们一定要告诉士兵们，我是个哑巴，脑子有点傻，男孩和我是兄弟，别人欠你们钱，所以把我们兄弟俩借给你抵债。我把剑和腰带藏到马背行李最里面。万一他们发现，你们要说是你们的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They wore no chainmail or helmets, but their identical dark tunics, with straps crossing from right shoulder to left hip, declared clearly their trade. Their swords were for now sheathed, though two of them were waiting with hands on the hilts. One was small, stocky and muscular; the other, a youth not much older than Edwin, was also short in stature. Both had closely cropped hair. In contrast, the third soldier was tall, with long grey hair, carefully groomed, that touched his shoulders and was held back by a dark string encircling his skull. Not only his appearance, but his manner differed noticeably from that of his companions; for while the latter were standing stiffly to bar the way across the bridge, he had remained several paces behind, leaning languidly against one of the bridge posts, arms folded before him as though listening to a tale beside a night fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="士兵们没穿锁子甲，没戴头盔，穿着相同的黑色套袍，肩带从右肩斜挎到左臀，明白无误地宣示着他们的身份。他们的剑暂时没有出鞘，但两名士兵手放在剑柄上。一个矮小、粗壮，肌肉结实；另一个是年轻人，比埃德温大不了多少，身材也不高。两人都理着短平头。相比之下，第三位士兵个子很高，留着灰白的长发，梳理得很整齐，披到肩膀上，头上箍着一根黑色的绳子，将头发拢到脑后。不仅外貌，他连姿态也与其他士兵明显不同。其他人僵硬地站在桥头挡住去路，他却在后面，隔着几步远，懒洋洋地靠在一根桥柱上，双手抱胸，好像晚上在篝火旁听故事一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they came closer to the bridge, the noise of the water rushing down the rocks and under the feet of the three awaiting soldiers grew more intense, and to Axl had something ominous about it. He led the way, listening to the horse's steps behind him on the mossy ground, and brought them to a halt when they were within hailing distance of the men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们离桥越来越近，水冲下岩石，从三位等待着的士兵脚下流过，水声越来越响，在埃克索听来，似乎是不祥的预兆。他在前面带路，听着身后马蹄踩在苔藓地上的声音，等来到士兵近前，他便让大家停下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The stocky soldier gave no reply. Uncertainty was crossing his face, and he glared at Axl with a mixture of panic and contempt. He cast a glance back to the young soldier behind him, then finding nothing to enlighten him, returned his gaze to Axl.</div>

<div class="line_en">It occurred to Axl there had been some confusion: that the soldiers had been expecting another party altogether, and had yet to realise their mistake. So he said: "We're just simple farmers, sir, on our way to our son's village."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索意识到，这里头可能有误会：士兵们在等候另外一拨人，还没意识到自己弄错了。于是他说道：“先生，我们就是普通的农夫，要到儿子的村庄去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Axl said this, the tall grey-haired soldier, as though suddenly reminded of something, took his weight from the bridge post, his head tilting in concentration. Meanwhile, the stocky soldier was staring angrily beyond both Axl and Beatrice. Then, his hand still on the hilt of his sword, he strode past to scrutinise the others. Edwin was holding the mare, and watched the oncoming soldier with expressionless eyes. Wistan, though, was giggling loudly to himself, his eyes roving, mouth wide open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索说话的时候，那个头发灰白的高个子士兵好像突然想起了什么事一样，站直了身子，侧着脑袋，一副聚精会神的样子。同时，粗壮的士兵愤怒地盯着埃克索和比特丽丝身后。然后，他大步从两人身旁走过，仔细打量另外这两个人，一只手仍旧按在剑柄上。埃德温拉着马，茫然地看着走过来的士兵。维斯坦却一个人咯咯地笑着，眼珠乱转，嘴张得大大的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The stocky soldier looked from one to the other as though for a clue. Then his frustration seemed to get the better of him. Grabbing Wistan's hair, he tugged it in a rage. "No one cut your hair, Saxon?" he shouted into the warrior's ear, then tugged again as though to bring Wistan to his knees. Wistan stumbled, but managed to stay on his feet, letting out pitiful whimpers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="粗壮的士兵看看这个，又看看那个，好像要寻找线索。然后，他好像再也无法克制自己的烦躁，一把抓住维斯坦的头发，愤怒地拽着。“没人给你剪头发吗，撒克逊人？”他对着武士的耳朵喊道，然后又拽他的头发，似乎是要维斯坦跪下来。维斯坦踉跄了一下，不过没有摔跤，同时发出了可怜的呜咽声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As his wife spoke, a small movement made Axl turn back to the soldiers still on the bridge. He saw then that the tall grey-haired man had raised an arm; his fingers all but formed a pointing shape before softening and collapsing in an aimless gesture. Finally he let his arm fall altogether, though his eyes went on watching with disapproval. Observing this, Axl suddenly had the feeling he understood, even recognised, what the grey-haired soldier had just gone through: an angry reprimand had all but shaped itself on his lips, but he had remembered in time that he lacked any formal authority over his stocky colleague. Axl was sure he had once had an almost identical experience himself somewhere, but he forced away the thought, and said in a conciliatory tone:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妻子说话的时候，埃克索感觉到身后有细微的动静，于是转身看着仍在桥上的两位士兵。他看到头发灰白的高个子士兵已经举起了一只手臂。他的手指快要做出指点的动作，却突然松弛下来，成了个没有意义的姿势。最后，他这条手臂全放下来了，但他的眼睛还在不满地看着。埃克索看着这一切，突然觉得能够理解头发灰白的士兵刚刚经历的内心感受，甚至有似曾相识之感：愤怒的批评都快到嘴边了，只是他及时想起来，他并没有正式的授权去指责这位粗壮的同事。埃克索肯定，自己在什么地方曾有过几乎相同的经历，不过他努力把这个念头抛开，用缓和的语气说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He doesn't speak, sir," Beatrice said. "As you see, he's simple. He doesn't mind rough treatment, but he's known for a temper we've yet to tame."</div>

Edwin, holding the mare by her muzzle, often whispering to her, followed closely behind, so that by the time Axl and Beatrice came in their wake, the path had been made much easier. Even so, the short cut -- if short cut it was -- became increasingly arduous: the trees deepened around them, tangled roots and thistles obliging them to attend to each step.

<div class="line_en">It was hard to say if Wistan had been right about his path cutting off a corner, but in any case, shortly after midday, they emerged out of the woods back onto the main road. Here it was wheel-rutted and boggy in parts, but now they could walk more freely, and in time the path grew drier and more level. With a pleasant sun falling through the overhanging branches, they travelled in good spirits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维斯坦说，他走的路要少绕一个大弯。很难判断他说得对不对，无论怎样，中午刚过，他们就走出了树林，回到了主路上。路上有车轮轧出的沟痕，有的地方有水坑，但他们可以走得更自在了，过了一会儿，路面就更干、更平了。温暖的阳光从低垂的树枝间洒下来，他们心情很好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the clearing came more into view, they saw it was of a fair size: perhaps once, in more prosperous times, someone had hoped to build a house here with a surrounding orchard. The path leading off from the main road, though overgrown, had been dug with care, ending in a large circular area, open to the sky except for one huge spreading oak at its centre. From where they now stood, they could see a figure seated in the shadows of the tree, his back against the trunk. He was for the moment in profile to them, and appeared to be in armour: two metal legs stuck out stiffly onto the grass in a childlike way. The face itself was obscured by foliage sprouting from the bark, though they could see he wore no helmet. A saddled horse was grazing contentedly nearby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到走近了，他们发现空地很大：也许以前更加繁华的日子里，有人曾打算在这儿建房子，周围再开辟一片果园。从主路通到这儿的小径，虽然杂草丛生，却挖得很用心，小径的尽头处是个巨大的圆形区域，头顶上方没有遮蔽，除了中央一棵茂盛的大橡树。从他们站立的地方，能看到一个人坐在树荫下，背靠着树干。这时他们看到的是他的侧影，似乎穿着盔甲：两条覆盖着铁甲的腿僵硬地在草地上伸着，像孩子一样。那张脸被橡树叶挡住了，看不清楚，不过他们能看到他没戴头盔。一匹上了鞍的马在一旁满足地吃草。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Wistan brought them to a halt again and indicated the ground before them. "There's a solitary rider not far before us," he said.

He appeared to be very tall, but beneath his armour Axl supposed him thin, if wiry. His armour was frayed and rusted, though no doubt he had done all he could to preserve it. His tunic, once white, showed repeated mending. The face protruding from the armour was kindly and creased; above it, several long strands of snowy hair fluttered from an otherwise bald head. He might have been a sorry sight, fixed to the ground, legs splayed before him, except that the sun falling through the branches above was now dappling him in patterns of light and shade that made him look almost like one enthroned.</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl recognised immediately the tall, grey-haired soldier who had spoken courteously to Beatrice at the bridge. The man still wore a faint smile, but was approaching them with his sword drawn, though pointed downwards, the hilt resting on the edge of the saddle. He came to a halt where just a few more of the animal's strides would have brought him to the tree. "Good day, Sir Gawain," he said, bowing his head a little.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索立即认出了骑马的人，就是那位头发灰白的高个子士兵，在桥上曾礼貌地对比特丽丝说过话。他脸上仍带着淡淡的笑意，但走过来的时候剑已经拔出，不过剑尖朝下，剑柄贴在马鞍边上。就在马再跨几步就会撞到树上的时候，他勒住缰绳。“你好，高文爵士，”他说，同时微微点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Forgive me, Sir Gawain. I wish only to question these companions of yours." He looked down at Wistan, who had again let his jaw drop slackly, and was giggling to himself. Without taking his eyes off the warrior, the soldier shouted: "Boy, move that horse no closer!" For indeed, behind him, Edwin had been approaching with Wistan's mare. "Hear me, lad! Let go the rein and come stand here before me beside your idiot brother. I'm waiting, lad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请原谅我，高文爵士。我只想问一问和你同行的这几个人。”他低头看着维斯坦，维斯坦下巴又耷拉下来，正一个人咯咯傻笑。那士兵眼睛没离开维斯坦，口里喊道：“小男孩，那匹马不要再靠近了！”没错，在他身后，埃德温正牵着维斯坦的马慢慢走过来。“听我的话，孩子！放开缰绳，过来到我面前站好，和你的傻哥哥一起。我在等着呢，孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old knight gazed up contemptuously from where he sat. "What do you mean by this, sir, arriving here sword unsheathed?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Edwin appeared to comprehend the soldier's wishes, if not his actual words, for he left the mare and came to join Wistan. As he did so, the soldier adjusted slightly the position of his horse. Axl, noticing this, understood immediately that the soldier was maintaining a particular angle and distance between himself and his charges that would give him the greatest advantage in the event of sudden conflict. Before, with Wistan standing where he was, the head and neck of the soldier's own horse would momentarily have obstructed his first swing of the sword, giving Wistan vital time either to unsettle the horse, or run to its blind side, where the sword's reach was diminished in scope and power by having to be brought across the body. But now the small adjusting of the horse had made it practically suicidal for an unarmed man, as Wistan was, to storm the rider. The soldier's new position seemed also to have taken expert account of Wistan's mare, loose some distance behind the soldier's back. Wistan was now unable to run for his horse without describing a wide curve to avoid the sword side of the rider, making it a near-certainty he would be run through from behind before reaching his destination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算听不懂士兵的话，埃德温似乎也能够理解他的意思，他放开了马缰绳，走到维斯坦身边。这时候，士兵略微调整了一下马的位置。埃克索注意到了这一点，他立即明白，士兵是要在自己和对方之间保持特定的角度和距离，以便在突然发生冲突的情况下获得最大优势。之前，考虑到维斯坦站立的位置，士兵自己的马头和马脖子会临时阻挡他第一次挥剑，维斯坦就可能获得关键的那一点儿时间，要么去惊扰马，要么跑到马的另一侧，如果是后者，那么士兵的剑要越过马的身体，攻击力量和范围就会减小。现在马的位置略作调整，像维斯坦这样没有武器的人要突袭士兵，几乎等于自杀。士兵的新位置体现了高超技巧，看来同时还考虑到了维斯坦的马，那匹马没人看管，就在他身后不远。现在维斯坦如果要骑上自己的马，就必须绕个大弯子，避开士兵持剑的那一侧，那样他在跑过去之前，几乎肯定会被士兵的马从背后撞上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl noted all this with a sense of admiration for the soldier's strategic skill, as well as dismay at its implications. There had been a time when Axl, too, had once nudged his horse forward, in another small but subtly vital manoeuvre, bringing himself in line with a fellow rider. What had he been doing that day? The two of them, he and the other rider, had been waiting on horseback, staring out across a vast grey moor. Until that moment his companion's horse had been in front, for Axl remembered its tail flicking and swaying before him, and wondering how much of this action was due to the animal's reflexes, and how much to the fierce wind sweeping across the empty land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索注意到了这一切，他钦佩士兵的战术技巧，也惊讶于其复杂含义。以前某个时候，埃克索也曾催马向前，以与另一位同行骑手并辔而行，这个动作幅度很小，但实际上非常重要。那天他在干什么呢？他们两个人，他自己和另外那位骑手，一直在马背上等待，眼睛望着辽阔的灰色原野。此前，同伴的马一直在前面，因为埃克索记得马尾巴在他眼前摇晃、抖动，当时他心里想，这是因为动物的本能呢，还是因为空阔的土地上刮着狂风？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Edwin came nearer the soldier reached out with his free hand. A tussle ensued as Edwin tried to fight him off, but the shirt was soon dragged up the boy's torso, and Axl saw, a little way below the ribs, a swollen patch of skin encircled by tiny dots of dried blood. On either side of him, Beatrice and Gawain were now leaning forward to see better, but the soldier himself, reluctant to take his gaze off Wistan, did not glance at the wound for some time. When finally he did so, he was obliged to make a swift turn of his head, and at that very moment, Edwin produced a piercing, high-pitched noise -- not a scream exactly, but something that reminded Axl of a forlorn fox. The soldier was for an instant distracted by it, and Edwin seized the chance to break from his grasp.

<div class="line_en">The soldier's own horse had made a panicked motion behind him, causing him further confusion, and by the time he had recovered, Wistan had gone clear of the sword's reach. The mare kept coming at daunting speed, and Wistan, feinting one way, then moving the other, produced another shrill call. The mare slowed to a canter, bringing herself between Wistan and his opponent, enabling the warrior, in an almost leisurely manner, to take up a position several strides from the oak. The mare turned again, moving smartly in pursuit of her master. Axl supposed Wistan's intention was to mount the animal as she came past, for the warrior was now waiting, both arms poised in the air. Axl even saw him reach towards the saddle just before the mare momentarily obscured him from view. But then the horse cantered on riderless towards the spot where so recently she had been enjoying the grass. Wistan had remained standing quite still, but now with a sword in his hand.</div>

He was looking towards his horse -- which had trotted some way away in panic -- as though for reassurance, then raised his sword, the tip just above the level of his shoulder, gripping tightly with both hands. This posture, Axl knew, was premature, and would only exhaust the arm muscles. Wistan, in contrast, looked calm, almost nonchalant, just as he had done the previous night when they had first glimpsed him setting off out of the village.

When he charged forward he did so with his sword high above his head in what seemed an unsophisticated, even suicidal attack; but just before he reached Wistan, he abruptly altered his trajectory, and feinted to his left, his sword lowered to his hip. The grey-haired soldier, Axl understood with a twinge of pity, knowing he stood little chance should the combat mature, had wagered everything on this one desperate ploy. But Wistan had anticipated it, or perhaps it was that his instincts were enough. The Saxon side-stepped neatly, and drew his own sword across the oncoming man in a single simple movement. The soldier let out a sound such as a bucket makes when, dropped into a well, it first strikes the water; he then fell forward onto the ground. Sir Gawain muttered a prayer, and Beatrice asked: "Is it done now, Axl?"</div>
