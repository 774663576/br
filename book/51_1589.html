<div class="line_en">My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. I'm not home, not with my mother. I'm in a dim, chilly cave, my bare feet freezing despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood. The haggard, pale face of a boy slides into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, I feel better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我睁开了眼睛，那种安全感顿然消失。我不是在家里，没有跟妈妈在一起。我在黑暗、冰冷的洞里，我的光脚在被子里已经冻僵了，空气中飘着一股血腥味。一张憔悴苍白的男孩子的脸映人我的眼帘。我先是一晾，接着平静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to return to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets, safe at home. I'm vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly I have the flu and this is why I'm allowed to stay in bed, even though I can tell I've been asleep a long time. My mother's hand strokes my cheek and I don't push it away as I would in wakefulness, never wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch. How much I miss her even though I still don't trust her. Then there's a voice, the wrong voice, not my mother's, and I'm scared. "Katniss," it says. "Katniss, can you hear me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨水打在石洞上，噼里啪啦的声音使我渐渐恢复了意识，我想再睡会儿。此时身上盖着温暖的毯子，安全地待在家里，我迷迷糊糊地觉得头很疼，兴许我感冒了，所以才可以躺在床上，我不知道已昏睡了多久。妈妈用她的手抚摸着我的面颊，我没有像清醒时那样把她的手推开。我不想让她知道我多么渴望她温柔的抚摸，尽管我不信任她，我对她又是多么思念。之后一个声音，不是妈妈的声音，说道：“凯特尼斯，你能听见我说话吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He doesn't seem angry about my tricking him, drugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe I'm just too beat-up and I'll hear about it later when I'm stronger. But for the moment, he's all gentleness.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has turned to a downpour, sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips. Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me. I feel a bit better, able to sit up without getting too dizzy, and I'm absolutely famished. So is Peeta. It's clear he's been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started.</div>

I can't help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh certainly did. It's not that Peeta's soft exactly, and he's proved he's not a coward. But there are things you don't question too much, I guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything. What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day? Would it shock him? The things we say about Panem? Gale's tirades against the Capitol?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没吱声，皮塔的话让我不由得想起在十二区不许跨越围障的警告，皮塔和盖尔不一样，盖尔会觉得那里藏着美昧的猎物，当然也会有危险。萨里什当然也清楚那里有危险。皮塔并不软弱，他已经证明了他不是懦夫。可我想，在一个面包飘香的家庭氛围里长大，他便不会有很重的好奇心了。可盖尔对一切都会发问。对于我和盖尔每天犯法越过围障后所说的那些玩笑话，皮塔又会如何看？会让他吃惊吗？还有我们所说的有关帕纳姆的事情，盖尔有关凯匹特的激烈言辞，他又会作何反应？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I look at that field, all I can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and rabid animals, and quicksand," Peeta says. "There could be anything in there."</div>

To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all.

<div class="line_cn" title="“黑密斯让我避开这个话题。”我无法正面回答，其实黑密斯从没说过这样的话。也许他正生我的气，在感情激荡的节骨眼，却掉了链子。可皮塔似乎已经悟出了话里的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I don't get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it's just a light one on the tip of my nose because Peeta's been distracted. "I think your wound is bleeding again. Come on, lie down, it's bedtime anyway," he says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可我没得到第二个热吻，皮塔只轻轻地在我鼻尖上吻了一下，他转而注意到我的伤口，“我觉得你的伤口又流血了，来吧，躺下吧，反正也该睡了。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta put his jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones, so he must be half frozen. I insist on taking the first watch, too, although neither of us think it's likely anyone will come in this weather. But he won't agree unless I'm in the bag, too, and I'm shivering so hard that it's pointless to object. In stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a million miles away, I'm struck by his immediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow; the other rests protectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No one has held me like this in such a long time. Since my father died and I stopped trusting my mother, no one else's arms have made me feel this safe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的袜子已经干透，可以戴了。我让皮塔穿上他自己的夹克。天气又湿又冷，寒气逼人，皮塔肯定已经冻僵了。我坚持自己先值班放哨，尽管我们俩都觉得在这种天气不会有人来。可他不同意，除非我也钻进睡袋。我已冻得浑身发抖，好像也没必要拒绝。两个晚上之前，我感到皮塔距我有千里之遥；而此时，他却与我紧紧相依。我们躺下来，他把我的头拨过去，枕在他胳膊上，另一只胳膊保护似的搁在我身上，他睡着了也没拿开。已经很长时间没人这样拥抱过我了。爸爸过世后，我也不信任妈妈，就再也没有任何人的臂膀曾给过我如此的安全感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This is the first kiss that we're both fully aware of. Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day drags on turning into evening and there's no break in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but nothing is forthcoming, either from lack of money -- everything will cost an exorbitant amount -- or because he's dissatisfied with our performance. Probably the latter. I'd be the first to admit we're not exactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, trying not to reopen wounds. We're sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly to keep warm. The most exciting thing either of us does is nap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白天过去，夜晚来临，天气也无丝毫好转。黑密斯是我们唯一的希望了，可他那里一点动静也没有，是因为缺钱——现在物价飞涨——还是不满意我们的表现？很可能是后者。我必须承认我们今天确实没什么精彩的表现。我们表现出来的只是饥饿、伤痛、惧怕伤口开裂，我们缩在睡袋里依偎在一起，可这么做主要是为了暖和些，我们所做的最令人激动的事就是——打盹。">查看中文翻译</div>

The thunder's so powerful it seems to shake the ground. Peeta's considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food, but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless. He won't be able to see three feet in front of his face and he'll only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He knows I'm right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful.</div>

There are girls in the Seam, some of the merchant girls, too, who navigate these waters so easily. But I've never had much time or use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isn't enough anymore clearly because if it was we'd have gotten food last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isn't just looking for physical affection, he wants something more personal.
