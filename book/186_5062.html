<div class="line_en">"Well done," said Aslan in a voice that made the earth shake. Then Digory knew that all the Narnians had heard those words and that the story of them would be handed down from father to son in that new world for hundreds of years and perhaps forever. But he was in no danger of feeling conceited for he didn't think about it at all now that he was face to face with Aslan. This time he found he could look straight into the Lion's eyes. He had forgotten his troubles and felt absolutely content.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“干得好，亚当的儿子。”狮子又说，“你曾经渴望得到这只苹果并为它流过泪，只有你的手可以栽下这颗用来保卫纳尼亚的树种。将苹果朝河边的松土扔过去吧。”—">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The children now noticed these two for the first time. They were dressed in strange and beautiful clothes, and from their shoulders rich robes flowed out behind them to where four dwarfs held up the King's train and four rivernymphs the Queen's. Their heads were bare; but Helen had let her hair down and it made a great improvement in her appearance. But it was neither hair nor clothes that made them look so different from their old selves. Their faces had a new expression, especially the King's. All the sharpness and cunning and quarrelsomeness which he had picked up as a London cabby seemed to have been washed away, and the courage and kindness which he had always had were easier to see. Perhaps it was the air of the young world that had done it, or talking with Aslan, or both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们现在才注意到这一对夫妻。他们穿着奇特而美丽的衣服，华贵的长袍从肩上一直拖到地上，四个小矮人托起国王的袍裾，四个河泽仙女托起王后的裙裾。他们的头上没有装饰，但海伦把头发披了下来，显得更加动人。然而，不是头发也不是服装使他们与过去迥然不同，而是脸上有了一种崭新的表情，尤其是国王。他在伦敦当马车夫时养成的尖刻、狡诈和好争吵的秉性全部涤荡一空，勇敢和善良的本性则比较明显。也许，是这个年轻世界的空气或与阿斯兰的谈话产生了这样的效果，也许两者兼有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Digory now saw that where four trees grew close together their branches had all been laced together or tied together with switches so as to make a sort of cage. The two Elephants with their trunks and a few dwarfs with their little axes soon got it all undone. There were three things inside. One was a young tree that seemed to be made of gold; the second was a young tree that seemed to be made of silver; but the third was a miserable object in muddy clothes, sitting hunched up between them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪格雷这才看见，四棵树紧紧地长在一起，树枝相互缠绕纠结，形成一个像笼子似的东西。两头大象用鼻子、几个小矮人用小斧很快分开了那些树枝。里面有三样东西：一棵小树，似乎是金子做的；另一棵像是银子做的小树；但第三样东西模样太惨，衣服上涂满泥浆，弓腰缩背地夹在两棵树之间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To explain all this we must go back a bit. The Beasts, you remember, had tried planting and watering him. When the watering brought him to his senses, he found himself soaking wet, buried up to his thighs in earth (which was quickly turning into mud) and surrounded by more wild animals than he had ever dreamed of in his life before. It is perhaps not surprising that he began to scream and howl. This was in a way a good thing, for it at last persuaded everyone (even the Warthog) that he was alive. So they dug him up again (his trousers were in a really shocking state by now). As soon as his legs were free he tried to bolt, but one swift curl of the Elephant's trunk round his waist soon put an end to that. Everyone now thought he must be safely kept somewhere till Aslan had time to come and see him and say what should be done about him. So they made a sort of cage or coop all round him. They then offered him everything they could; think of to eat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们必须倒回去才能解释清楚。你记得动物们曾试着把他栽进土里并且浇了水吧？当水使他头脑清醒时，他发现自己浑身湿透，大腿以下全部埋在土里（土很快变成了泥浆），被他做梦也想不到的众多野兽包围着。自然他开始尖声号叫。从某种意义上讲，这是一件好事，因为，最终动物们（包括野猪）知道他还活着。于是，它们又把他挖出来（此刻，他的裤子着实会吓人一跳）。腿一出来，他就想跑，但大象用鼻子在他腰上轻轻一卷便挡住了他。每个动物都认为必须将他安全地囚起来，直到阿斯兰有空过来看了以后再行发落。所以，它们就做了一个笼子或者说棚子将他圈了起来。然后，用它们想得到的所有食物喂他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Donkey collected great piles of thistles and threw them in, but Uncle Andrew didn't seem to care about them. The Squirrels bombarded him with volleys of nuts but he only covered his head with his hands and tried to keep out of the way. Several birds flew to and fro deligently dropping worms on him. The Bear was especially kind. During the afternoon he found a wild bees' nest and instead of eating it himself (which he would very much like to have done) this worthy creature brought it back to Uncle Andrew. But this was in fact the worst failure of all. The Bear lobbed the whole sticky mass over the top of the enclosure and unfortunately it hit Uncle Andrew slap in the face (not all the bees were dead). The Bear, who would not at all have minded being hit in the face by a honeycomb himself, could not understand why Uncle Andrew staggered back, slipped, and sat down. And it was sheer bad luck that he sat down on the pile of thistles. "And anyway," as the Warthog said, "quite a lot of honey has got into the creature's mouth and that's bound to have done it some good." They were really getting quite fond of their strange pet and hoped that Aslan would allow them to keep it. The cleverer ones were quite sure by now that at least some of the noises which came out of his mouth had a meaning. They christened him Brandy because he made that noise so often.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="驴子将一大堆蓟扔进笼子，但安德鲁舅舅似乎并不理睬。松鼠们连珠炮似的砸下许多坚果，但他只是用手遮头，想法躲开。几只鸟儿勤奋地飞来飞去，向笼子里投下虫子。那头熊尤其善良。下午，它发现一只野蜂的蜂巢，高尚的熊自己舍不得吃（它其实非常想吃），带回来给了安德鲁舅舅。然而，这是最失败的一招。熊把那团黏乎乎的东西挂在笼子的顶上，不巧打着了安德鲁舅舅的脸（不是所有的蜂都死了）。那头熊自己毫不在乎脸被蜂巢打一下，也就无法理解安德鲁舅舅为什么蹒跚着往后退，滑了一跤，跌坐在地。而非常不幸的是，他又坐在了那堆蓟上。“无论如何，”像那头野猪说的，“不少蜂蜜流进了那东西的嘴巴，一定会对他有好处。”它们对这个奇怪的宠物真正地感起兴趣来，并希望阿斯兰允许它们饲养他。较聪明的一些动物十分肯定地说，他嘴里发出的声音中至少有一部分是有意义的。它们叫他“白兰地”，因为他常常发出那个音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He bowed his great head rather sadly, and breathed into the Magician's terrified face. "Sleep," he said. "Sleep and be separated for some few hours from all the torments you have devised for yourself." Uncle Andrew immediately rolled over with closed eyes and began breathing peacefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它神情悲戚地低下巨大的头，朝魔法师受惊的脸上吹了一口气。“睡，”它说，“睡吧，把你自找的烦恼丢开几小时吧。”安德鲁舅舅立即合上眼皮，倒在地上，开始安详地呼吸起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">More Dwarfs than you could dream of rushed forward to the Golden Tree. They had all its leaves stripped off, and some of its branches torn off too, before you could say Jack Robinson. And now the children could see that it did not merely look golden but was of real, soft gold. It had of course sprung up from the half-sovereigns which had fallen out of Uncle Andrew's pocket when he was turned upside down; just as the silver had grown up from the half-crowns. From nowhere, as it seemed, piles of dry brushwood for fuel, a little anvil, hammers, tongs, and bellows were produced. Next moment (how those dwarfs loved their work!) the fire was blazing, the bellows were roaring, the gold was melting, the hammers were clinking. Two Moles, whom Aslan had set to dig (which was what they liked best) earlier in the day, poured out a pile of precious stones at the dwarfs' feet. Under the clever fingers of the little smiths two crowns took shape -- not ugly, heavy things like modern European crowns, but light, delicate, beautifully shaped circles that you could really wear and look nicer by wearing. The King's was set with rubies and the Queen's with emeralds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="做梦也想不到的许许多多小矮人朝那棵金树奔去，眨眼问，就把树上的全部叶子和一些枝桠摘了下来。孩子们现在知道，那棵树不光是金色的，而且的确是柔软的金子。它当然是从安德鲁舅舅被倒立时口袋里金币落地的地方长出来的，就像银币落地会长成银树一样。小矮人不知从哪儿弄来一堆做燃料的干灌木，还有一个小铁砧，几把铁锤，钳子和风箱。不一会儿（小矮人们很喜欢自己的工作），火就烧旺了，风箱呼呼地拉响，金子熔化了，铁锤丁丁当当地敲打起来。刚才被阿斯兰派去掘地的两只鼹鼠（它们最喜欢掘地）把一堆珍贵的宝石倒在小矮人脚下。小铁匠们灵巧的双手做成了两顶王冠——不像现在欧洲的王冠那样笨重、丑陋，而是两个轻巧、精致、造型优美的圆环，你真的可以戴上而且戴上后会更漂亮。国王的王冠上镶着红宝石，王后的王冠上镶着绿宝石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then everyone cheered or bayed or neighed or trumpeted or clapped its wings and the royal pair stood looking solemn and a little shy, but all the nobler for their shyness. And while Digory was still cheering he heard the deep voice of Aslan beside him, saying:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家全都欢呼、狂吠、嘶呜，或拍打翅膀，或发出喇叭一样的声音。国王夫妇站起来，表情庄严，略带羞涩，但羞涩使他们看上去更加高贵。迪格雷正在欢呼，耳边响起阿斯兰低沉的声音：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the crowns had been cooled in the river Aslan made Frank and Helen kneel before him and he placed the crowns on their heads.

<div class="line_en">Everyone in that crowd turned its head, and then everyone drew a long breath of wonder and delight. A little way off, towering over their heads, they saw a tree which had certainly not been there before. It must have grown up silently, yet swiftly as a flag rises when you pull it up on a flagstaff, while they were all busied about the coronation. Its spreading branches seemed to cast a light rather than a shade, and silver apples peeped out like stars from under every leaf. But it was the smell which came from it, even more than the sight, that had made everyone draw in their breath. For a moment one could hardly think about anything else.</div>
