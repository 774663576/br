<div class="line_en">Pippin looked out from the shelter of Gandalf's cloak. He wondered if he was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift-moving dream in which he had been wrapped so long since the great ride began. The dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He could see nothing but the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where the mountains of the South marched past. Sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy and uncertain.</div>

<div class="line_en">There had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt, and then in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the silent town and the great empty house on the hill. And hardly had they reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again, and men wilted with fear. But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and Gandalf giving orders. And then again riding, riding in the night. This was the second, no, the third night since he had looked in the Stone. And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他们第一次在这种高速下马不停蹄地奔驰，接着，在曙光之中，他看见了薄弱的金光，发现来到了一座寂静的小镇，山丘上还有许多空荡荡的房屋。当那长着翅膀的魔影再度飞越的时候，即使是最坚强的战士也觉得心胆俱裂。但甘道夫一直在他耳边呢喃着温柔的话语，让他在角落沉睡着。皮聘虽然十分的疲倦，却觉得相当地不安，依稀感觉得到人们来来去去，甘道夫则是正在发号施令。然后，又是一段夜间的狂奔，这是第二，不，是他使用过水晶球之后的第三夜。一想起这段恐怖的经历，他完全清醒过来，耳边急促的风声立刻转化成步步进逼的威胁声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers. Pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful country Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed his eyes, and then he saw that it was the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now almost at the full. So the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on. He stirred and spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空又再度泛白，黄色的火焰似乎被隔绝在黑暗的屏障之后。皮聘缩起身体，感到十分害怕，不明白甘道夫究竟领着他来到了什么样恐怖的地方。他揉揉眼睛，这才发现原来是圆月正从东方缓缓升起。看来时候尚早，应该还会赶上好一段路。他换了个姿势，开口问道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a silence again for a while. Then, "What is that?" cried Pippin suddenly, clutching at Gandalf's cloak. "Look! Fire, red fire! Are there dragons in this land? Look, there is another!"</div>

<div class="line_en">For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. "On, Shadowfax! We must hasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling for aid. War is kindled.

<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫对着骏马大喊作为回应。“影疾，快！我们必须再快一点，时间已经很紧迫了。你看！刚铎的烽火已经燃起，这是通知盟友驰援的信号，战火已经点燃了。你看，阿蒙丁山上亮着火焰，爱伦那奇的烽火也跟着点亮，讯号继续往西传：那多、伊瑞拉斯、明瑞蒙、加仑汉，以及在洛汗边境的哈力费理安。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Shadowfax paused in his stride, slowing to a walk, and then he lifted up his head and neighed. And out of the darkness the answering neigh of other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the West. Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="影疾却突然慢了下来，接着抬起头嘶鸣了几声。从黑暗中传来了其他马匹的回应，零落的马蹄声也渐渐靠近。三名在月光下像是鬼魅一般的骑士来势汹汹，随即消失在西方的黑暗中。影疾抖擞精神，立刻撒开四蹄狂奔，夜色如同潮水一般掠过它身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to Belfalas in the South. "It is long since the beacons of the North were lit," he said; "and in the ancient days of Gondor they were not needed, for they had the Seven Stones." Pippin stirred uneasily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘又再度觉得昏昏欲睡，没有多少精神理会甘道夫对他苦口婆心讲述刚铎的传统；甘道夫解释城主在邻近的山丘上和边境建造烽火台，同时也在这些地方设置驿站，随时备好快马将消息传递到北方的洛汗或是南方的贝尔法拉斯去。“北方的烽火已经沉寂了许久，”他说：“而在古代，由于刚铎拥有七晶石，他们根本不需要这种简陋的通讯方法。”皮聘又不安地动了动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sleep again, and do not be afraid!" said Gandalf. "For you are not going like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will be as safe as you can be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or the Ring is taken, then the Shire will be no refuge."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快睡吧，不要害怕！”甘道夫说：“因为你不像佛罗多一样必须去魔多，你要去的是米那斯提力斯。这是自由世界最后的堡垒。如果刚铎沦陷，或是魔戒失落，连夏尔都会跟着落入魔掌。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You do not comfort me," said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over him. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon. He wondered where Frodo was, and if he was already in Mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the coming of the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听起来并不怎么让人心安啊！”皮聘说，不过，睡意还是老实不客气地征服了他。在他陷入沉睡之前的最后一个印象是高耸的白色山峰，这些山峰沐浴在西沉圆月洒下的月光中，像是漂浮在云海间的岛屿。他开始担心佛罗多身在何方，如果他真的已经到了魔多，现在是生是死？他并不知道，远方的佛罗多也正在看着同样的月亮自刚铎沉落，等待新的一天到来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippin woke to the sound of voices. Another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by. It was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, and chill grey mists were about them. Shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. Many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone. Partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, and the creak of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘被人声给吵醒了，这又是另一个躲躲藏藏和连夜赶路的一天。现在正是黎明，冰冷的寒意依旧步步进逼，灰色的迷雾包围着众人。影疾浑身冒着热气和汗水，但它依旧骄傲地昂挺着头，没有露出任何疲倦的样子。许多高大的人类披着厚重斗篷站在他身边，在他们身后的迷雾中矗立着一座石墙。看来这石墙已经饱经风霜，不过，在夜色完全消退之前，皮聘就可以听见许多人忙碌工作的声响：铁锤击打、车轮滚动、铲子挖掘。火把在迷雾中照亮了部分的景物，甘道夫正在和挡住他去路的男子说话，当皮聘凝神倾听的时候，这才发现他们在讨论的话题和他有关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will vouch for him before the seat of Denethor," said Gandalf. "And as for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. He has passed through more battles and perils than you have, Ingold, though you be twice his height; and he comes now from the storming of Isengard, of which we bear tidings, and great weariness is on him, or I would wake him.

<div class="line_en">Gandalf passed now into the wide land beyond the Rammas Echor. So the men of Gondor called the out-wall that they had built with great labour, after Ithilien fell under the shadow of their Enemy. For ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains' feet and so back again, enclosing in its fence the fields of the Pelennor: fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes and terraces falling to the deep levels of the Anduin. At its furthest point from the Great Gate of the City, north-eastward, the wall was four leagues distant, and there from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the river, and men had made it high and strong; for at that point, upon a walled causeway, the road came in from the fords and bridges of Osgiliath and passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its nearest point the wall was little more than one league from the City, and that was south-eastward. There Anduin, going in a wide knee about the hills of Emyn Arnen in South Ithilien, bent sharply west, and the out-wall rose upon its very brink; and beneath it lay the quays and landings of the Harlond for craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The townlands were rich, with wide tilth and many orchards, and homesteads there were with oast and garner, fold and byre, and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands down to Anduin. Yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many, and the most part of the people of Gondor lived in the seven circles of the City, or in the high vales of the mountain-borders, in Lossarnach, or further south in fair Lebennin with its five swift streams. There dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea. They were reckoned men of Gondor, yet their blood was mingled, and there were short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the Dark Years ere the coming of the kings. But beyond, in the great fief of Belfalas, dwelt Prince Imrahil in his castle of Dol Amroth by the sea, and he was of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky, and Pippin roused himself and looked up. To his left lay a sea of mist, rising to a bleak shadow in the East; but to his right great mountains reared their heads, ranging from the West to a steep and sudden end, as if in the making of the land the River had burst through a great barrier, carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come. And there where the White Mountains of Ered Nimrais came to their end he saw, as Gandalf had promised, the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, the deep purple shadows of its high glens, and its tall face whitening in the rising day. And upon its out-thrust knee was the Guarded City, with its seven walls of stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white, blushing faintly in the dawn; and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the City. Then Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high within the topmost wall, shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze, and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then men fell back before the command of his voice and questioned him no further, though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at the horse that bore him. For the people of the City used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those ridden by the errand-riders of their lord. And they said: "Surely that is one of the great steeds of the King of Rohan? Maybe the Rohirrim will come soon to strengthen us." But Shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他威严无比的嗓音下，人们敬畏地纷纷退让，不敢再继续质问；不过，当看到哈比人和他们胯下的骏马时，人们依旧无法掩饰眼中的好奇之色。王城中的人们极少骑乘马匹，在街道上更少见到马匹的踪影，唯一的例外只有替摄政王跑腿的信差。他们交头接耳说道：“这一定就是洛汗国王所拥有的骏马吧？或许骠骑军团很快就会前来支援了。”影疾依旧头也不回，自信地往目标走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the fashion of Minas Tirith was such that it was built on seven levels, each delved into the hill, and about each was set a wall, and in each wall was a gate. But the gates were not set in a line: the Great Gate in the City Wall was at the east point of the circuit, but the next faced half south, and the third half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the paved way that climbed towards the Citadel turned first this way and then that across the face of the hill. And each time that it passed the line of the Great Gate it went through an arched tunnel, piercing a vast pier of rock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided in two all the circles of the City save the first. For partly in the primeval shaping of the hill, partly by the mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide court behind the Gate a towering bastion of stone, its edge sharp as a ship-keel facing east. Up it rose, even to the level of the topmost circle, and there was crowned by a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might, like mariners in a mountainous ship, look from its peak sheer down upon the Gate seven hundred feet below. The entrance to the Citadel also looked eastward, but was delved in the heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit slope ran up to the seventh gate. Thus men reached at last the High Court, and the Place of the Fountain before the feet of the White Tower: tall and shapely, fifty fathoms from its base to the pinnacle, where the banner of the Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米那斯提力斯的城池是以独特的方式兴建的，城中分成七层，每一层都有独立的城墙和入口，但这些入口并非是一直线的：主城墙的正门位在整座城半圆的东方，下一座门则是建造在城的东南方，第三座则是在城的东北方，所有的入口都是依这样的规律兴建的。因此，进入要塞的道路蜿蜒曲折地绕着山丘铺设。每当这条道路经过垂直正门的位置时，它都会穿过拱形的隧道，有一座极为庞大的巨岩正好将整座城池分割成两半，只有第一层例外。这特殊的景观一部分是天然的山势，一部分是古代巧匠的鬼斧神工。这座锋利如同刀刃一般的巨岩就位于正门广场后方，一路延伸到这座圆形城池的最高层。巨岩的最顶端还兴建了另一座堡垒，让顶端要塞中的守军可以像是巨舰中的水手一般，俯瞰七百尺之下的正门。通往城中要塞的入口也同样面对着西方，但却是凿穿坚硬的岩石所雕凿出来的，然后是一道通往第七门的斜坡。人们最后才来到了执政厅，以及净白塔前的圣泉园。高耸简洁的净白塔直入云霄一百五十尺，摄政王的旗号就在塔顶俯瞰着千尺以下的大平原。">查看中文翻译</div>

But that shoulder, which rose to the height of the fifth wall, was hedged with great ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end; and in that space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords, for ever silent between the mountain and the tower.</div>

Yet it was in truth falling year by year into decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease there. In every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes: names Pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there; and yet now they were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out from door or empty window.</div>

Upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many-pointed stars.

Quickly Gandalf strode across the white-paved court.

<div class="line_en">They walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin. "Be careful of your words, Master Peregrin! This is no time for hobbit pertness. Théoden is a kindly old man. Denethor is of another sort, proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and power, though he is not called a king. But he will speak most to you, and question you much, since you can tell him of his son Boromir. He loved him greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. But under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he wishes from you rather than from me. Do not tell him more than you need, and leave quiet the matter of Frodo's errand. I will deal with that in due time. And say nothing about Aragorn either, unless you must."</div>

The floor was of polished stone, white-gleaming, inset with flowing traceries of many colours.

At the far end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble shaped like a crowned helm; behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower. But the throne was empty. At the foot of the dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there was a stone chair, black and unadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. In his hand was a white rod with a golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his footstool. Then Gandalf spoke.</div>

"How much older?" he wondered, and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it before. Treebeard had said something about wizards, but even then he had not thought of Gandalf as one of them. What was Gandalf? In what far time and place did he come into the world, and when would he leave it?

After several turns they came to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side, not far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain. Within, upon the first floor above the street, up a wide carven stair, he showed them to a fair room, light and airy, with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. It was sparely furnished, having but a small table, two chairs and a bench; but at either side there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing. There were three high narrow windows that looked northward over the great curve of Anduin, still shrouded in mists, towards the Emyn Muil and Rauros far away.

<div class="line_en">The sun was now climbing, and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up. The last of them were floating away, just overhead, as wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the East, that was now flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel. Away down in the valley-bottom, five leagues or so as the eye leaps, the Great River could now be seen grey and glittering, coming out of the north-west, and bending in a mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer, far beyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippin could see all the Pelennor laid out before him, dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls, barns and byres, but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasts. Many roads and tracks crossed the green fields, and there was much coming and going: wains moving in lines towards the Great Gate, and others passing out. Now and again a horseman would ride up, and leap from the saddle and hasten into the City. But most of the traffic went out along the chief highway, and that turned south, and then bending swifter than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from sight. It was wide and well-paved, and along its eastern edge ran a broad green riding-track, and beyond that a wall. On the ride horsemen galloped to and fro, but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains going south. But soon Pippin saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the wains were moving in three lines, one swifter drawn by horses; another slower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men.</div>

Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. But even as he looked it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun.</div>

It is growing and darkening now; and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. And the Fell Riders, less than a year ago they won back the crossings, and many of our best men were slain. Boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back from this western shore, and we hold still the near half of Osgiliath. For a little while. But we await now a new onslaught there. Maybe the chief onslaught of the war that comes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是说在这么靠近魔多的地方？”贝瑞贡低声说：“是的，魔多就在那边，我们很少提到它，但多年来我们一直生活在那阴影之下。有时它看起来比较遥远、模糊，有时看起来则是比较靠近、深沉。现在它看起来正在逐渐增长，我们的恐惧和不安也是一样。那些堕落骑士在不到一年之前抢回了渡口，我们许多最精锐的战士都死在他们手中。波罗莫好不容易才将敌人困在对岸，我们至今依旧死守着西边的废墟，至少暂时是如此；不过，我们预料会有一波更强的攻势，或许是这场战争中最大的攻势。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Some say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the Tower at night, and bends his thought this way and that, he can read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the mind of the Enemy, wrestling with him.

<div class="line_en">"But if you would know what I think set the beacons ablaze, it was the news that came that eve out of Lebennin. There is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of Anduin, manned by the corsairs of Umbar in the South. They have long ceased to fear the might of Gondor, and they have allied them with the Enemy, and now make a heavy stroke in his cause. For this attack will draw off much of the help that we looked to have from Lebennin and Belfalas, where folk are hardy and numerous. All the more do our thoughts go north to Rohan; and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that you bring."</div>

He looked at the great walls, and the towers and brave banners, and the sun in the high sky, and then at the gathering gloom in the East; and he thought of the long fingers of that Shadow: of the orcs in the woods and the mountains, the treason of Isengard, the birds of evil eye, and the Black Riders even in the lanes of the Shire -- and of the winged terror, the Nazgûl. He shuddered, and hope seemed to wither. And even at that moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured, as though a dark wing had passed across it.

<div class="line_en">Bergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had since he parted from Merry, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. Before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the Great Gate. There Pippin went up much in the esteem of Bergil, for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯几尔的确是个相当不错的伙伴，事实上，这是皮聘离开梅里以来，所遇过最容易亲近的同伴，很快的，他们就打成一片，笑嘻嘻地在街道间穿梭，丝毫不在意人们投以奇怪眼光。过不了多久，他们就发现自己混入了朝向正门走去的人潮中。皮聘在那边展现了让伯几尔更为尊敬的特殊地位：当他报出名号，说出通行密码之后，守卫向他敬礼，让他通过；更好的是，守卫让他带着同伴一起过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is good!" said Bergil. "We boys are no longer allowed to pass the Gate without an elder. Now we shall see better."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了！”伯几尔说：“我们小孩子没有大人带是不能走出正门的，这下子我们可以看得更清楚了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beyond the Gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of the great paved space into which all the ways to Minas Tirith ran. All eyes were turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose: "There is dust away there! They are coming!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正门外的人们挤在路旁，连所有道路汇合的广场上也挤满了人，所有人都专注地看着南方，很快地人们开始低声交谈：“那边有了尘烟！他们来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippin and Bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd, and waited. Horns sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled towards them like a gathering wind. Then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and all about them people were shouting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘和伯几尔奋力挤到群众最前面，准备看个清楚。不远处传来了号角声，人们的欢呼声如同波浪一般朝他们的方向涌来。然后是一声震耳的号角，四周所有的群众全都开始欢呼起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“佛龙！佛龙！”皮聘听见人们喊着。“他们在喊些什么？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse, and on it sat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth, but old and grey-bearded, yet mail-clad and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear. Behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men, well-armed and bearing great battle-axes; grim-faced they were, and shorter and somewhat swarthier than any men that Pippin had yet seen in Gondor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在队伍的正前头是一匹四肢粗大的马，上面坐着一个虎背熊腰的男子，一脸灰色的胡子，看起来年纪不小。他披着锁子甲，戴着黑色的头盔，肩膀上扛着一支沉重的长枪。在他身后是一长列的部队，他们都全副武装，手持巨大的战斧；这些人脸色都十分的凝重，看起来比刚铎的人要粗犷、矮壮一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Forlong!" men shouted. "True heart, true friend! Forlong!" But when the men of Lossarnach had passed they muttered: "So few! Two hundreds, what are they? We hoped for ten times the number. That will be the new tidings of the black fleet. They are sparing only a tithe of their strength. Still every little is a gain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佛龙！”人们大喊着：“患难见真情！佛龙万岁！”但是，当罗萨那奇的援军通过之后，人们开始窃窃私语：“这么少！只有两百名，这是怎么一回事？我们还以为会有两千名的支援。这一定是和那黑色舰队入侵的消息有关。他们只能派出一小部分的部队来支援，虽然是杯水车薪，但总比什么都没有要好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed through the Gate, men of the Outlands marching to defend the City of Gondor in a dark hour; but always too few, always less than hope looked for or need asked. The men of Ringló Vale behind the son of their lord, Dervorin striding on foot: three hundreds. From the uplands of Morthond, the great Blackroot Vale, tall Duinhir with his sons, Duilin and Derufin, and five hundred bowmen. From the Anfalas, the Langstrand far away, a long line of men of many sorts, hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages, scantily equipped save for the household of Golasgil their lord. From Lamedon, a few grim hillmen without a captain. Fisher-folk of the Ethir, some hundred or more spared from the ships. Hirluin the Fair of the Green Hills from Pinnath Gelin with three hundreds of gallant green-clad men. And last and proudest, Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth, kinsman of the Lord, with gilded banners bearing his token of the Ship and the Silver Swan, and a company of knights in full harness riding grey horses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at arms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这支部队就在众人的欢呼之下进入了刚铎的正门，边境的战士前来援助处在黑暗时刻的刚铎，但是，这股力量总是太小、永远比众人需要或是希望的要少。林罗谷的援军跟在德佛林王子身后步行前来，总共三百人；来自摩颂河上游的黑根谷，高大的敦赫带着儿子敦林和迪鲁芬，以及五百名弓箭手来支援刚铎；从安法拉斯，遥远的朗斯特兰来的则是各式各样的帮手，有猎人、牧人和小村中的农人，除了他们的领主哥拉斯吉尔的卫兵之外，这一大群人几乎没有携带任何装备。从拉密顿来的是几十名衣衫褴褛、没有军官带队的战士；伊瑟的渔民，则是从船上抽调出几百名的援手；皮那斯杰林的绿丘来的贺路恩，则带来了三百名老练的绿衣战士。最后，军容最壮盛的是多尔安罗斯的印拉希尔王，他是摄政王的血亲，家徽则是巨舰和银色的天鹅。一队铁衣重甲的骑士骑着灰马，身后则是七百名和印拉希尔一样高大的战士，他们都拥有灰色的眼眸、黑色的头发，一边自信地唱着军歌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And that was all, less than three thousands full told. No more would come. Their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the City and died away. The onlookers stood silent for a while. Dust hung in the air, for the wind had died and the evening was heavy. Already the closing hour was drawing nigh, and the red sun had gone behind Mindolluin. Shadow came down on the City.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippin looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey, as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them, and light came dully through it.

<div class="line_en">"Farewell for this time," said Bergil. "Take my greetings to my father, and thank him for the company that he sent. Come again soon, I beg. Almost I wish now that there was no war, for we might have had some merry times. We might have journeyed to Lossarnach, to my grandsire's house; it is good to be there in spring, the woods and fields are full of flowers. But maybe we will go thither together yet. They will never overcome our Lord, and my father is very valiant. Farewell and return!"</div>

<div class="line_en">They parted and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel. It seemed a long way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and dark. Not a star pricked the sky. He was late for the daymeal in the mess, and Beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his son. After the meal Pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table. Gandalf was not there. Gloom settled still more heavily on Pippin. He climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window, but it was like looking into a pool of ink. He got down and closed the shutter and went to bed. For a while he lay and listened for sounds of Gandalf's return, and then he fell into an uneasy sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房内除了桌上的一盏小灯之外，显得相当的幽暗，甘道夫还是不在。皮聘觉得心情更沉重了。他爬到板凳上，试着往窗外窥探，但外面黑得好像一池墨水一样。他爬下板凳，关上窗户，躺回床上。他躺在床上等着甘道夫回来的声响，最后才不安地睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
