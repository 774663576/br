<div class="line_en">Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a glorified pot-au-feu, an animated merkin, what really attracted me to Valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. She gave it not because she had divined something about me; it was just her style -- and I fell for it. Actually, she was at least in her late twenties (I never established her exact age for even her passport lied) and had mislaid her virginity under circumstances that changed with her reminiscent moods. I, on my part, was as naive as only a pervert can be. She looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed à la gamine, showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and pouted, and dimpled, and romped, and dirndled, and shook her short curly blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a brief ceremony at the mairie, I took her to the new apartment I had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her wear, before I touched her, a girl's plain nightshirt that I had managed to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage. I derived some fun from that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. But reality soon asserted itself. The bleached curl revealed its melanic root; the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin; the mobile moist mouth, no matter how I stuffed it with love, disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama; and presently, instead of a pale little gutter girl, Humbert Humbert had on his hands a large, puffy, short-legged, big-breasted and practically brainless baba.</div>

<div class="line_en">This state of affairs lasted from 1935 to 1939. Her only asset was a muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our small squalid flat: two rooms, a hazy view in one window, a brick wall in the other, a tiny kitchen, a shoe-shaped bath tub, within which I felt like Marat but with no white-necked maiden to stab me. We had quite a few cozy evenings together, she deep in her Paris-Soir, I working at a rickety table. We went to movies, bicycle races and boxing matches. I appealed to her stale flesh very seldom, only in cases of great urgency and despair. The grocer opposite had a little daughter whose shadow drove me mad; but with Valeria's help I did find after all some legal outlets to my fantastic predicament. As to cooking, we tacitly dismissed the pot-au-feu and had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue Bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. And next door, an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid, flamboyant, green, red, golden and inky blue, ancient American estampe -- a locomotive with a gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher, hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a lot of spark-studded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这情状从一九三五年持续到一九三九年。她唯一有价值的是逐渐和缓的天性，这确实有助于在我们又小又脏的套房里建立起一种临时的舒适感：两间屋，一间窗外是模糊的景色，另一边是一堵砖墙，一间小厨房，一个鞋形木浴盆，坐在里面，我觉得自己象马拉，只是没有一个粉颈少女来刺杀我。我们曾经一起有过极少温暖安逸的夜晚，她沉醉于她的《巴黎晚报》，我则伏在一张摇摇晃晃的桌上工作。我们去看电影，骑自行车看拳击赛。我很少向她不再鲜嫩的肉体求欢。除非在特别焦灼和沉痛失望的时候。对面的店铺商有个小女儿，她的情影令我发疯；好在有瓦莱里亚的帮助，无论如何，我狂热的心境还是得到了合法的疏泄。至于做饭，我们默默地放弃了蔬菜牛肉汤的小锅伙食，大半去波拿巴街一处拥挤的地方进餐，那儿的桌布上到处是葡萄酒污迹，还有许多外国口音噪嗓不休。隔壁，一位艺术商在他杂乱的橱窗里陈列了一幅华丽、明艳、涂满大绿大红、金灿灿墨蓝蓝的古代美国钢版画——一辆火车头带一只巨型烟囱，巴洛克式怪状大灯，还有一架巨大的排障器拖着它淡紫色的客车厢穿过风雪漫天的大草原之夜，闪烁着火星的浓烟混入电闪雷鸣的锦云中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These burst. In the summer of 1939 mon oncle d' Amérique died bequeathing me an annual income of a few thousand dollars on condition I came to live in the States and showed some interest in his business. This prospect was most welcome to me. I felt my life needed a shake-up. There was another thing, too: moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial comfort. During the last weeks I had kept noticing that my fat Valeria was not her usual self; had acquired a queer restlessness; even showed something like irritation at times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was supposed to impersonate. When I informed her we were shortly to sail for New York, she looked distressed and bewildered. There were some tedious difficulties with her papers. She had a Nansen, or better say Nonsense, passport which for some reason a share in her husband's solid Swiss citizenship could not easily transcend; and I decided it was the necessity of queuing in the préfecture, and other formalities, that had made her so listless, despite my patiently describing to her America, the country of rosy children and great trees, where life would be such an improvement on dull dingy Paris.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were coming out of some office building one morning, with her papers almost in order, when Valeria, as she waddled by my side, began to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word. I let her go on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside. She answered (I translate from her French which was, I imagine, a translation in its turn of some Slavic platitude): "There is another man in my life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天上午我们从一家办公大楼出来，她的证件基本办妥；在我身边蹒跚的瓦莱里亚，突然剧烈地摇动起她狮子狗一样的脑袋，却又一言不发。我让她持续片刻，然后问她是不是心中有事，她回答说（我把她的法语翻译过来，我想，必然就是一句斯拉夫人的陈词滥调）：“我生活中还有另一个男人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. They dazed me, I confess. To beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. Years of secret sufferings had taught me superhuman self-control. So I ushered her into a taxi which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in this comparative privacy I quietly suggested she comment her wild talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在现在的丈夫听来，这是最丑陋的语言。它们使我晕头转向，我承认。若象一般诚实的粗夫，就在街上随便什么地方揍她一顿，但这并不可取。多少年来的隐痛已经教会我超人的自制。所以我把她招进一辆已经在路边缓行多时的出租车，在这种较为秘密的地方，轻声建议她解释一下她的粗话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A mounting fury was suffocating me -- not because I had any particular fondness for that figure of fun, Mme Humbert, but because matters of legal and illegal conjunction were for me alone to decide, and here she was, Valeria, the comedy wife, brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my comfort and fate. I demanded her lover's name. I repeated my question; but she kept up a burlesque babble, discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an immediate divorce. "Mais qui est-ce?" I shouted at last, striking her on the knee with my fist; and she, without even wincing, stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. He pulled up at a small café and introduced himself. I do not remember his ridiculous name but after all those years I still see him quite clearly -- a stocky White Russian ex-colonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut; there were thousands of them plying that fool's trade in Paris. We sat down at a table; the Tsarist ordered wine; and Valeria, after applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on talking -- into me rather than to me; she poured words into this dignified receptacle with a volubility I had never suspected she had in her. And every now and then she would volley a burst of Slavic at her stolid lover. The situation was preposterous and became even more so when the taxi-colonel, stopping Valeria with a possessive smile, began to unfold his views and plans. With an atrocious accent to his careful French, he delineated the world of love and work into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his child-wife Valeria. She by now was preening herself, between him and me, rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at her blouse-bosom and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent, and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred, for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser one; and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain impressions, I can swear that he actually consulted me on such things as her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or should read. "I think," he said, "she will like Jean Christophe?" Oh, he was quite a scholar, Mr. Taxovich.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一股突增的愤怒使我窒息——并非因为我对那个可笑形象，亨伯特夫人，有什么特殊兴趣，而是因为合法与不合法结合的事应完全由我一人决断，而她，瓦莱里亚，是喜剧妻子，如今竟厚颜无耻地准备按她的方式来摆布我的安逸和命运。我要她情人的名字。我重复一遍我的问话；但她坚持象滑稽表演似地嘟哝着，论述她和我在一起的不幸福，申明她立刻离婚的计划。“他到底是谁？”我终于吼出来，用拳头猛击她的膝盖；而她；毫不退缩，盯着我，好象答案太简单，根本用不着说，然后迅速地耸耸肩，指了指出租车司机的胖脖子。他在一家小咖啡店停下车，作了自我介绍。我记不清他可笑的名字了，只在这么多年过后，仍然很清楚他的样子——一个结实的前白俄上校，胡子蓬乱，留平头；这样的人，在巴黎总有成千上万，经常从事这种傻瓜生意。我们拣张桌子坐下；沙皇分子要了葡萄酒；瓦莱里亚在膝上放好一张潮湿的餐巾后，又开始说起来——指着我，而不仅是朝着我；我从来没料到她会有如此雄辩的口才，语言能注在这样尊贵的容器中。并且还时不时向她不动声色的情人发射一串斯拉夫语。情况真是荒谬透顶，尤其当那位出租车上校以自得的微笑打断了瓦莱里亚，并开始陈述他的观点和计划时，情况更是荒谬不可言。他用他那夹杂着劣质口音的精确法语描述了爱情和工作兼有的世界，并决定同他的娃娃妻子瓦莱里亚手拉手地走进去。这会儿她开始修饰自己了，坐在他和我之间，涂抹她干皱的嘴唇，又搔首弄姿，挑剔她宽松衬衣的胸襟等等，他谈论着她，就象她根本不在眼前，又好象她是一个受监护的孩子，为了她的利益，从一个聪明的保护者转移给另一个更聪明的保护人；尽管我无望的愤怒已经夸大并且破坏了某种印象，我仍敢起誓他实际上是在向我咨询有关她的情况，诸如减肥饮食、经期、衣服以及她读过的和应该读过的书目。“我想，”他说，“她会喜欢《约翰。克里斯朵夫》的吧？”噢，他简直是个学者了，达霍维奇先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But we never were. Valechka -- by now shedding torrents of tears tinged with the mess of her rainbow make-up,-- started to fill anyhow a trunk, and two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my mountain boots and taking a running kick at her rump were of course impossible to put into execution with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time. I cannot say he behaved insolently or anything like that; on the contrary, he displayed, as a small sideshow in the theatricals I had been inveigled in, a discreet old-world civility, punctuating his movements with all sorts of mispronounced apologies (j'ai demannde pardonne -- excuse me -- est-ce que j'ai puis -- may I -- and so forth), and turning away tactfully when Valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline above the tub; but he seemed to be all over the place at once, le gredin, agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat, reading in my chair my newspaper, untying a knotted string, rolling a cigarette, counting the teaspoons, visiting the bathroom, helping his moll to wrap up the electric fan her father had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage. I sat with arms folded, one hip on the window sill, dying of hate and boredom. At last both were out of the quivering apartment -- the vibration of the door I had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve, a poor substitute for the backhand slap with which I ought to have hit her across the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. Clumsily playing my part, I stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my English toilet water; they had not; but I noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust that the former Counselor of the Tsar, after thoroughly easing his bladder, had not flushed the toilet. That solemn pool of alien urine with a soggy, tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult, and I wildly looked around for a weapon. Actually I daresay it was nothing but middle-class Russian courtesy (with an oriental tang, perhaps) that had prompted the good colonel (Maximovich! his name suddenly taxies back to me), a very formal person as they all are, to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to underscore the small size of his host's domicile with the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我们再也没有这机会了。瓦莱契卡——这会儿飞流而下的眼泪把她彩虹摸样的粉妆染得乱七八糟——已经装满一只大木箱，两个小皮箱，一个鼓胀的纸盒。那位该诅咒的上校一直在旁边踱来踱去，时而穿着我的登出靴，时而朝她屁股飞踢一脚，这真叫我无计可施。我不能说他的表现有什么无礼，或傲慢之处；相反，象是在一场把我编入其中的附加戏中，他处处展示出旧时代的贤明谨慎之礼，每一举动都先附上各种各样发音错误的道歉（我请求原谅——对不起——我是否能——我能不能——等等），当瓦莱契卡从浴盆上方的晾衣绳上倏地拽下她粉色内裤，他机敏地转过身去；但是立刻他好象就占据了房间的每个角落，这个无赖，认为他的骨胳正适宜这套房间的构造，坐在我的椅子里读我的报纸，解开一根系著的绳子，点起一支烟，数数茶匙，参观了洗澡间，帮助他的娇妇包起她父亲送她的电扇，然后，把她的行李朝街上抬去。我半个屁股坐在窗台上，交叉双臂，痛恨、厌倦得要死。最后，两人双双走出了这振动的房间，——我在他们身后撞上门，门的震颤仍然敲着我的每根神经，这撞门就可怜巴巴地代替了那反手一拳，按照电影规则，我应该把它打在她的颧骨上。拙劣地演完了我的戏，我一脚踏进洗澡间，想查看一下他们是否裹带走了我的英国香水；他们没有；但是我一转身，突然一阵强烈厌恶袭来，我发观这位沙皇政府前幕僚，在彻底舒服了他的膀胱以后，竟没有冲刷马桶。那个庄严的池膛里，一汪异邦人的尿，温和着一只粘湿、黄褐色的烟蒂，在里面膨胀，这真象奇耻大辱重重打击了我，于是我疯狂地四处找寻武器。实际上，我敢说，这并没什么，不过是俄罗斯中产阶级的礼貌（或许还带有东方风味）激励了那位好心的上校（马克西莫维奇！他的名字突然用计程车送还了我），一个象其他人一样非常严肃正经的人，把他个人的需要压抑在彬彬有礼的无声状态，让他所有的急流紧搂着他自己肃静的细流直泻而下，以便能不突出他主人住所的狭小。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I put an end to this gibberish by suggesting Valeria pack up her few belongings immediately, upon which the platitudinous colonel gallantly offered to carry them into the car. Reverting to his professional state, he drove the Humberts to their residence and all the way Valeria talked, and Humbert the Terrible deliberated with Humbert the Small whether Humbert Humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither. I remember once handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student, in the days (I have not spoken of them, I think, but never mind) when I toyed with the idea of enjoying his little sister, a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow, and then shooting myself. I now wondered if Valechka (as the colonel called her) was really worth shooting, or strangling, or drowning. She had very vulnerable legs, and I decided I would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打断这番叽哩呱拉的言语，建议瓦莱里亚收拾她那点财物，不得延误，对此，平庸乏味的上校勇敢地提出可以把它们搬上车。于是他又恢复原职，载着亨伯特夫妇去他们的寓所。一路上，瓦莱里亚都在说着，而倒楣的亨伯特却在和小亨伯特商讨着亨伯特。亨伯特是否应该杀了她或她的情人，或俩人一起，或一个也不。我记得曾经玩过一个年轻同学的一支自动手枪（我没有提过这事几，但无关紧要），那会儿我竟产生了先享受一下他的小妹妹，一个最最透明的性感少女，有一头卷曲的黑发，然后再自毙的念头。我现在怀疑瓦莱契卡（上校这样叫她）是否真地值得击毙，或勒死，或淹死。她长着非常脆弱的腿，我决定，一旦就剩下我们两人时，我要予以猛击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But this did not enter my mind at the moment, as groaning with rage I ransacked the kitchen for something better than a broom. Then, canceling my search, I dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted; despite my natural vigor, I am no pugilist, while the short but broad-shouldered Maximovich seemed made of pig iron. The void of the street, revealing nothing of my wife's departure except a rhinestone button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. But no matter. I had my little revenge in due time. A man from Pasadena told me one day that Mrs. Maximovich née Zborovski had died in childbirth around 1945; the couple had somehow got over to California and had been used there, for an excellent salary, in a year-long experiment conducted by a distinguished American ethnologist. The experiment dealt with human and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant position on all fours. My informant, a doctor, swore he had seen with his own eyes obese Valechka and her colonel, by then gray-haired and also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the well-swept floors of a brightly lit set of rooms (fruit in one, water in another, mats in a third and so on) in the company of several other hired quadrupeds, selected from indigent and helpless groups. I tried to find the results of these tests in the Review of Anthropology; but they appear not to have been published yet.</div>

I hope they will be illustrated with good photographs when they do get printed, although it is not very likely that a prison library will harbor such erudite works. The one to which I am restricted these days, despite my lawyer's favors, is a good example of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison libraries. They have the Bible, of course, and Dickens (an ancient set, N. Y., G. W.
