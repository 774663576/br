<div class="line_en">Mrs. Athelny lent Philip money to pay his landlady enough of her bill to let him take his things away. For five shillings and the pawn-ticket on a suit he was able to get from a pawnbroker a frock coat which fitted him fairly well. He redeemed the rest of his clothes. He sent his box to Harrington Street by Carter Patterson and on Monday morning went with Athelny to the shop. Athelny introduced him to the buyer of the costumes and left him. The buyer was a pleasant, fussy little man of thirty, named Sampson; he shook hands with Philip, and, in order to show his own accomplishment of which he was very proud, asked him if he spoke French. He was surprised when Philip told him he did.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Sampson turned away; and Philip, trying to remember where this or the other department was, watched anxiously for the customer in search of information. At one o'clock he went up to dinner. The dining-room, on the top floor of the vast building, was large, long, and well lit; but all the windows were shut to keep out the dust, and there was a horrid smell of cooking. There were long tables covered with cloths, with big glass bottles of water at intervals, and down the centre salt cellars and bottles of vinegar. The assistants crowded in noisily, and sat down on forms still warm from those who had dined at twelve-thirty.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No pickles," remarked the man next to Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有腌菜啊。”坐在菲利普旁边的男人抱怨了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was a tall thin young man, with a hooked nose and a pasty face; he had a long head, unevenly shaped as though the skull had been pushed in here and there oddly, and on his forehead and neck were large acne spots red and inflamed. His name was Harris. Philip discovered that on some days there were large soup-plates down the table full of mixed pickles. They were very popular. There were no knives and forks, but in a minute a large fat boy in a white coat came in with a couple of handfuls of them and threw them loudly on the middle of the table. Each man took what he wanted; they were warm and greasy from recent washing in dirty water. Plates of meat swimming in gravy were handed round by boys in white jackets, and as they flung each plate down with the quick gesture of a prestidigitator the gravy slopped over on to the table-cloth. Then they brought large dishes of cabbages and potatoes; the sight of them turned Philip's stomach; he noticed that everyone poured quantities of vinegar over them. The noise was awful. They talked and laughed and shouted, and there was the clatter of knives and forks, and strange sounds of eating. Philip was glad to get back into the department. He was beginning to remember where each one was, and had less often to ask one of the assistants, when somebody wanted to know the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他年纪轻轻，个子高瘦，苍白的脸上长着鹰钩鼻，脑袋很长，这边凸出来，那边陷进去，形状特别古怪。额头和脖子上生着粉刺，发了炎，红通通的一大片。他叫哈里斯。菲利普日后才知道，餐厅有时会供应各式各样的腌菜，满满当当地装好几盘，摆在桌子上。员工们都喜欢吃腌菜。桌子上没有放刀叉，过了几分钟，一个穿着白色上衣的大胖子拿了一大把餐具走过来，咣啷啷地扔到桌子中间。每个人都把自己要用的拿过来。这些刀叉刚从脏水里洗过一遍，还油腻腻的带着温度。穿着白色上衣的服务生给每个人分了一盘飘了几片肉的汤。他们动作飞快，像变戏法似的把盘子往桌上一扔，溅出来的肉汁把桌布弄得脏兮兮的。分完肉汤，又端来几盘卷心菜和土豆，菲利普看了一眼，顿时没了胃口。他看见其他人都往菜上倒了好多醋。餐桌上人声喧天，又说又笑，还有几个尖着嗓子嚎了几声；刀叉碰在一起叮叮当当，夹杂着吧唧吧唧的咀嚼声吵得人心生烦躁。回到营业部，菲利普好歹松了口气。他开始熟悉每个营业区的位置，有顾客来问路，也不用像之前那样总是要跑去问营业员了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One or two of the girls spoke to him, just a word when things were slack, and he felt they were taking his measure. At five he was sent up again to the dining-room for tea. He was glad to sit down. There were large slices of bread heavily spread with butter; and many had pots of jam, which were kept in the `store' and had their names written on.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was exhausted when work stopped at half past six. Harris, the man he had sat next to at dinner, offered to take him over to Harrington Street to show him where he was to sleep. He told Philip there was a spare bed in his room, and, as the other rooms were full, he expected Philip would be put there. The house in Harrington Street had been a bootmaker's; and the shop was used as a bed-room; but it was very dark, since the window had been boarded three parts up, and as this did not open the only ventilation came from a small skylight at the far end. There was a musty smell, and Philip was thankful that he would not have to sleep there. Harris took him up to the sitting-room, which was on the first floor; it had an old piano in it with a keyboard that looked like a row of decayed teeth; and on the table in a cigar-box without a lid was a set of dominoes; old numbers of The Strand Magazine and of The Graphic were lying about. The other rooms were used as bed-rooms. That in which Philip was to sleep was at the top of the house. There were six beds in it, and a trunk or a box stood by the side of each. The only furniture was a chest of drawers: it had four large drawers and two small ones, and Philip as the new-comer had one of these; there were keys to them, but as they were all alike they were not of much use, and Harris advised him to keep his valuables in his trunk. There was a looking-glass on the chimney-piece. Harris showed Philip the lavatory, which was a fairly large room with eight basins in a row, and here all the inmates did their washing. It led into another room in which were two baths, discoloured, the woodwork stained with soap; and in them were dark rings at various intervals which indicated the water marks of different baths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到六点半下班，菲利普已经累得浑身散架。吃饭时和他坐一块的小伙子哈里斯主动说要和他一起回哈灵顿街，带他看看睡觉的地方。他说其他屋子都已经住满了，自己房间还剩个空床位，希望菲利普可以搬过来一起。位于哈灵顿街的员工宿舍原本是一个靴匠的房子，过去的店铺被改造成卧室，窗玻璃被木板封了三扇，光线特别不好，又没法敞开，只能靠屋后一个小小的天窗通风透气。这里弥漫着一股发霉的味道，菲利普暗自庆幸，好歹自己不用非得在这儿住下。哈里斯带他去一楼客厅看了看，里面有架旧钢琴，泛黄的琴键看着像一排蛀了的烂牙。桌上有个没盖儿的雪茄盒子，装着一套多米诺骨牌。房间里到处都是扔得乱七八糟的《海滨杂志》和《图画报》。剩下几间房都改成了宿舍，菲利普要住的那间在最顶层，里面有六张床，每张床边都摆了旅行箱或者大木箱，壁炉架上还有面镜子。唯一的家具就是衣橱，带有四大两小，六个抽屉。菲利普是新来的，也分了一个抽屉。每个抽屉都配着锁，但钥匙是一样的，所以这锁也没什么用处。哈里斯建议菲利普把贵重物品放到箱子里，然后又带他去盥洗室转了一圈。盥洗室相当宽敞，八个脸盆并排摆着，所有在这儿的员工都来这里洗漱。另一间屋里有两个褪了色的木制澡盆，上面还粘着干了的肥皂泡和一圈圈高低不一的黑渍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Harris and Philip went back to their bed-room they found a tall man changing his clothes and a boy of sixteen whistling as loud as he could while he brushed his hair. In a minute or two without saying a word to anybody the tall man went out. Harris winked at the boy, and the boy, whistling still, winked back. Harris told Philip that the man was called Prior; he had been in the army and now served in the silks; he kept pretty much to himself, and he went off every night, just like that, without so much as a good-evening, to see his girl. Harris went out too, and only the boy remained to watch Philip curiously while he unpacked his things. His name was Bell and he was serving his time for nothing in the haberdashery. He was much interested in Philip's evening clothes. He told him about the other men in the room and asked him every sort of question about himself. He was a cheerful youth, and in the intervals of conversation sang in a half-broken voice snatches of music-hall songs. When Philip had finished he went out to walk about the streets and look at the crowd; occasionally he stopped outside the doors of restaurants and watched the people going in; he felt hungry, so he bought a bath bun and ate it while he strolled along. He had been given a latch-key by the prefect, the man who turned out the gas at a quarter past eleven, but afraid of being locked out he returned in good time; he had learned already the system of fines: you had to pay a shilling if you came in after eleven, and half a crown after a quarter past, and you were reported besides: if it happened three times you were dismissed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等哈里斯和菲利普回到卧室，正赶上里面有个大高个男人在换衣服。一个十来岁的男孩一边梳头一边大声吹着口哨。过了一两分钟，高个男人一声不吭走出去了。哈里斯朝那男孩眨了眨眼，男孩吹着口哨，也朝他眨眨眼。哈里斯跟菲利普说，那个男人叫普莱尔，当过兵，现在在丝绸部工作。他从不和别人打交道，每天晚上都像刚才那样一个人跑出去找他对象，连声再见都不说。过了一会儿，哈里斯也出门了，菲利普开始收拾行李，屋里只剩那个吹口哨的男孩在好奇地打量着他。男孩名叫贝尔，在日用百货区帮手，不拿薪水。他对菲利普的晚礼服特别感兴趣，把室友的情况向菲利普介绍一番，又问了各种各样、千奇百怪的问题。他性格开朗活泼，聊上两句就要扯着破锣嗓子唱段从杂耍剧院听来的歌。菲利普收拾好东西便上街溜达了，眼前人群来来往往。他不时停在餐馆门口，眼巴巴地看着别人进去吃饭。他饿极了，买了块果脯面包，三口两口吃下去，继续往前走。宿舍管理员每晚十一点一刻准时熄掉汽灯。他给了菲利普一把弹簧钥匙，但菲利普怕被锁在门外，还是趁早赶回去了。他已经清楚宿舍的罚款制度了，十一点后回来罚一先令，再迟一刻就罚半克朗，还要通报警告。晚归三次就会被赶出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was only two shillings a month, and it covered medical attendance and the use of a library of worn novels; but as four shillings a month besides was stopped for washing, Philip discovered that a quarter of his six shillings a week would never be paid to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于联谊会，菲利普也有所听闻。举办这场聚会的花费是从他们的工资里扣的，为此，商店的员工一肚子不情愿。虽然一个月只收两先令，而且这里面还包含了医疗费、一个只有几本旧小说的破烂图书馆的使用费，但是除此之外还要另付四先令的洗衣费。菲利普发现每周挣的六先令里总有四分之一到不了他手上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most of the men were eating thick slices of fat bacon between a roll of bread cut in two. These sandwiches, the assistants' usual supper, were supplied by a small shop a few doors off at twopence each. The soldier rolled in; silently, rapidly, took off his clothes and threw himself into bed. At ten minutes past eleven the gas gave a big jump and five minutes later went out. The soldier went to sleep, but the others crowded round the big window in their pyjamas and night-shirts and, throwing remains of their sandwiches at the women who passed in the street below, shouted to them facetious remarks. The house opposite, six storeys high, was a workshop for Jewish tailors who left off work at eleven; the rooms were brightly lit and there were no blinds to the windows. The sweater's daughter -- the family consisted of father, mother, two small boys, and a girl of twenty -- went round the house to put out the lights when work was over, and sometimes she allowed herself to be made love to by one of the tailors. The shop assistants in Philip's room got a lot of amusement out of watching the manoeuvres of one man or another to stay behind, and they made small bets on which would succeed. At midnight the people were turned out of the Harrington Arms at the end of the street, and soon after they all went to bed: Bell, who slept nearest the door, made his way across the room by jumping from bed to bed, and even when he got to his own would not stop talking. At last everything was silent but for the steady snoring of the soldier, and Philip went to sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was awaked at seven by the loud ringing of a bell, and by a quarter to eight they were all dressed and hurrying downstairs in their stockinged feet to pick out their boots. They laced them as they ran along to the shop in Oxford Street for breakfast. If they were a minute later than eight they got none, nor, once in, were they allowed out to get themselves anything to eat. Sometimes, if they knew they could not get into the building in time, they stopped at the little shop near their quarters and bought a couple of buns; but this cost money, and most went without food till dinner. Philip ate some bread and butter, drank a cup of tea, and at half past eight began his day's work again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天七点，一阵响铃把他吵醒，到了七点四十五，所有人都衣着整齐，穿好袜子，下楼蹬上靴子就走。他们一边手忙脚乱地扎着外套上的衣带，一边往牛津大街跑，好去公司吃顿早饭。如果八点还没到那里，哪怕就晚了一分钟，也什么都吃不上了。而且只要进了公司，就不能再跑出来自己吃东西。有时候，如果他们已经稳稳地要迟到了，就干脆在附近的小商店买几个小圆面包，但是这要另花钱，所以大多数人就一直饿着肚子等吃午饭。菲利普吃了点黄油面包，喝了一杯茶。八点半，一天的工作正式开始了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon he began to answer the questions quite mechanically. The work was monotonous and very tiring. After a few days his feet hurt him so that he could hardly stand: the thick soft carpets made them burn, and at night his socks were painful to remove. It was a common complaint, and his fellow `floormen' told him that socks and boots just rotted away from the continual sweating. All the men in his room suffered in the same fashion, and they relieved the pain by sleeping with their feet outside the bed-clothes. At first Philip could not walk at all and was obliged to spend a good many of his evenings in the sitting-room at Harrington Street with his feet in a pail of cold water. His companion on these occasions was Bell, the lad in the haberdashery, who stayed in often to arrange the stamps he collected. As he fastened them with little pieces of stamp-paper he whistled monotonously.</div>
