<div class="line_en">There was no doubt in anyone's mind that Bonnie Butler was running wild and needed a firm hand but she was so general a favorite that no one had the heart to attempt the necessary firmness. She had first gotten out of control the months when she traveled with her father. When she had been with Rhett in New Orleans and Charleston she had been permitted to sit up as late as she pleased and had gone to sleep in his arms in theaters, restaurants and at card tables. Thereafter, nothing short of force would make her go to bed at the same time as the obedient Ella. While she had been away with him, Rhett had let her wear any dress she chose and, since that time, she had gone into tantrums when Mammy tried to dress her in dimity frocks and pinafores instead of blue taffeta and lace collars.</div>

<div class="line_en">There seemed no way to regain the ground which had been lost when the child was away from home and later when Scarlett had been ill and at Tara. As Bonnie grew older Scarlett tried to discipline her, tried to keep her from becoming too headstrong and spoiled, but with little success. Rhett always sided with the child, no matter how foolish her desires or how outrageous her behavior. He encouraged her to talk and treated her as an adult, listening to her opinions with apparent seriousness and pretending to be guided by them. As a result, Bonnie interrupted her elders whenever she pleased and contradicted her father and put him in his place. He only laughed and would not permit Scarlett even to slap the little girl's hand by way of reprimand.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Rhett showed no inclination to make Bonnie behave. Whatever she did was right and if she wanted the moon she could have it, if he could reach it for her. His pride in her beauty, her curls, her dimples, her graceful little gestures was boundless. He loved her pertness, her high spirits and the quaint sweet manner she had of showing her love for him. For all her spoiled and willful ways she was such a lovable child that he lacked the heart to try to curb her. He was her god, the center of her small world, and that was too precious for him to risk losing by reprimands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是瑞德没有表示要教育孩子学好的意思。她做什么都是对的，她要月亮就给月亮，如果他能去摘下来的话。他对她的美貌，她的鬈发，她的酒窝，她的优美的姿势，无不感到骄傲。他爱她的淘气，爱她的兴高采烈，以及她用以表示爱他的那种奇特而美妙的样子。尽管她有骄惯和任性的地方，但她毕竟是那样可爱的一个孩子，他怎么能忍心去约束她呢！他是她心目的上帝，是她小小世界的中心，这对他实在太宝贵了，他决不敢冒丧失这一地位的危险去训斥她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Bonnie was four years old, Mammy began to grumble about the impropriety of a girl child riding "a-straddle in front of her pa wid her dress flyin' up." Rhett lent an attentive ear to this remark, as he did to all Mammy's remarks about the proper raising of little girls. The result was a small brown and white Shetland pony with a long silky mane and tail and a tiny sidesaddle with silver trimmings. Ostensibly the pony was for all three children and Rhett bought a saddle for Wade too. But Wade infinitely preferred his St. Bernard dog and Ella was afraid of all animals. So the pony became Bonnie's own and was named "Mr. Butler." The only flaw in Bonnie's possessive joy was that she could not still ride astride like her father, but after he had explained how much more difficult it was to ride on the sidesaddle, she was content and learned rapidly. Rhett's pride in her good seat and her good hands was enormous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邦妮满四岁后，嬷嬷便开始唠叨了，抱怨一个小姑娘不能骑着马，“横坐在她爸前面，衣裳被风撩得高高的。”瑞德对于这一批评颇为重视，因为嬷嬷提出的有关教育女孩子的意见，他一般都比较注意。结果他就买了一匹褐色的设特兰小马驹，它有光滑的长鬃和尾巴，连同一副小小的带有银饰的女鞍。从表面上看，这匹小马驹是给三个孩子买的，而且还给韦德也买了一副鞍子，可是韦德更喜爱他的那条圣伯纳德猫，而爱拉又害怕一切动物，因此这匹小马驹实际上便成了邦妮一个人的，名字就叫“巴特勒先生。”邦妮的占有欲得到了满足，唯一遗憾的是她还没有学会像她父亲那样跨骑在马鞍上。不过经过瑞德向她解释，说明侧骑在女鞍上比跨骑还要困难得多，她便感到高兴而且很快就学会了。瑞德对她骑马的姿势和灵巧的手腕是非常得意的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It amused and touched Scarlett to see the iron hand with which her small child ruled her father. Who would have thought that Rhett, of all people, would take fatherhood so seriously? But sometimes a dart of jealousy went through Scarlett because Bonnie, at the age of four, understood Rhett better than she had ever understood him and could manage him better than she had ever managed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思嘉眼看自己的女儿用一又小手牢牢地控制着她的父亲，心里又高兴又感动。有谁能像瑞德这样一条汉子，做起父亲来竟会如此严肃而认真呢？不过，有时候思嘉也心怀妒忌，痛苦不堪，因为邦妮刚刚四岁，却比她更加了解瑞德，更能驾驭他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“等着瞧吧，到她可以打猎了的时候，准保世界上哪个猎手也不如她呢，”瑞德夸口说。“那时我要带她弗吉尼亚去，那里才是真正打猎的地方。还有肯塔基，骑马就得到那里去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“唔，就让她做蓝丝绒的。要是弄脏了，我们就给她再做一件，”瑞德轻松地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Bonnie had her blue velvet habit with a skirt that trailed down the pony's side and a black hat with a red plume in it, because Aunt Melly's stories of Jeb Stuart's plume had appealed to her imagination. On days that were bright and clear the two could be seen riding down Peachtree Street, Rhett reining in his big black horse to keep pace with the fat pony's gait. Sometimes they went tearing down the quiet roads about the town, scattering chickens and dogs and children, Bonnie beating Mr. Butler with her crop, her tangled curls flying, Rhett holding in his horse with a firm hand that she might think Mr. Butler was winning the race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，邦妮便有了一件蓝丝绒骑马服，衣襟下垂到小马肋部；还配做了一顶黑色的帽子，上面插着根红羽毛，那是受了媚兰讲的杰布·斯图尔特故事的启发。每当风和日丽，父女俩便骑马在桃树街上并辔而行，瑞德勒着缰绳让他那匹大黑马缓缓地配合那只小马的步伐啊啊。有时他们一直跑到城郊的僻静道路上，把孩子们和鸡呀、狗呀吓得乱窜。邦妮用马鞍抽打着她的“巴特勒先生，”满头纠缠着的鬈发迎风飘舞，瑞德则紧紧地勒着他的马，让他觉得她的“巴特勒先生”会赢得这场赛跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, my darling! Not that blue velvet! The blue velvet is for a party dress for me," laughed Scarlett. "A nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear." Seeing the small black brows coming together: "For Heaven's sake, Rhett, tell her how unsuitable it would be and how dirty it will get."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，宝贝！还是不要用这种蓝丝绒吧！蓝丝绒是我参加衬交活动时穿的呢，”思嘉笑着说。“小姑娘最好穿黑府绸的。”这时她看见那两道小小的黑眉已经皱起来了，便赶紧说：“瑞德，看在上帝面上，你告诉她那种料子对她多么不合适，而且还很容易脏呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had assured himself of her seat, her hands, her utter fearlessness, Rhett decided that the time had come for her to learn to make the low jumps that were within the reach of Mr. Butler's short legs. To this end, he built a hurdle in the back yard and paid Wash, one of Uncle Peter's small nephews, twenty-five cents a day to teach Mr. Butler to jump. He began with a bar two inches from the ground and gradually worked up the height to a foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来瑞德确信她的坐势已经很稳当了，她的手腕已经很灵巧有力，而且她一点也不胆怯了，便决定让她学习跳栏，当然那高度只能是小马的脚长所能达到的。因此，他在后面场院里放置了一个栏架，还以每天25美分的工儿雇用彼得大叔的侄子沃什来教“巴特勒先生”跳栏。它从离地两英寸开始，逐渐跳到一英尺的高度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This arrangement met with the disapproval of the three parties concerned, Wash, Mr. Butler and Bonnie. Wash was afraid of horses and only the princely sum offered induced him to take the stubborn pony over the bar dozens of times a day; Mr. Butler, who bore with equanimity having his tail pulled by his small mistress and his hooves examined constantly, felt that the Creator of ponies had not intended him to put his fat body over the bar; Bonnie, who could not bear to see anyone else upon her pony, danced with impatience while Mr. Butler was learning his lessons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个安排遭到了最有关系的三方：即沃什、“巴特勒先生”和邦妮的反对。沃什是很怕马的，因为贪图高工钱才勉强答应教这只倔强的小马每天跳栏20次。“巴特勒先生”让它的小女主人经常拉尾巴和看蹄子，总算还忍受得住，可是总觉得它那生来肥胖的身躯是越不过那根栏杆的。至于邦妮，她最不高兴别人骑她的小马，因此一看见“巴特勒先生”被活什么骑着练习跳栏，便急得直顿脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Rhett finally decided that the pony knew his business well enough to trust Bonnie upon him, the child's excitement was boundless. She made her first jump with flying colors and, thereafter, riding abroad with her father held no charms for her. Scarlett could not help laughing at the pride and enthusiasm of father and daughter. She thought, however, that once the novelty had passed, Bonnie would turn to other things and the neighborhood would have some peace. But this sport did not pall. There was a bare track worn from the arbor at the far end of the yard to the hurdle, and all morning long the yard resounded with excited yells. Grandpa Merriwether, who had made the overland trip in 1849, said that the yells sounded just like an Apache after a successful scalping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到瑞德最后认定小马已训练得很好，可以让邦妮自己去试试了，这孩子才无比地兴奋起来。她第一次试跳就欣然成功，便觉得跟父亲一起骑马外出没有什么意思了。思嘉看着这父女俩那么兴高采烈，禁好笑，她心想只要这新鲜劲儿过去，邦妮的兴趣便会转到别的玩意上，那时左邻右舍就可以安静些了。可是邦妮对这项游戏毫不厌倦。后院里从最远那头的凉亭直到栏架，已出现一条踏得光光的跑道。从那里整个上午都不断传来兴奋的呐喊声。这些呐喊，据一八四九年作过横跨大陆旅行的梅里韦瑟爷爷说，跟一个阿帕切人成功地剥一次头皮后的欢叫完全一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the third night after Bonnie's death, Mammy waddled slowly up the kitchen steps of Melanie's house. She was dressed in black from her huge men's shoes, slashed to permit freedom for her toes, to her black head rag. Her blurred old eyes were bloodshot and red rimmed, and misery cried out in every line of her mountainous figure. Her face was puckered in the sad bewilderment of an old ape but there was determination in her jaw.</div>

<div class="line_en">Melanie rose to her feet, confused, her heart quailing at the thought of confronting Rhett. The thought of arguing with a man as grief crazed as the one Mammy depicted made her go cold. The thought of entering that brightly lighted room where lay the little girl she loved so much wrung her heart. What could she do? What could she say to Rhett that would ease his grief and bring him back to reason? For a moment she stood irresolute and through the closed door came the sound of her boy's treble laughter.

<div class="line_en">She left the house without a hat, her dinner napkin still clutched in her hand, and the pace she set was hard for Mammy's old legs. Once in Scarlett's front hall, she bowed briefly to the gathering in the library, to the frightened Miss Pittypat, the stately old Mrs. Butler, Will and Suellen.

<div class="line_en">The door opened quickly and Mammy, shrinking back into the shadows of the hall, saw Rhett huge and dark against the blazing background of candles.

<div class="line_cn" title="门很快开了，嬷嬷畏缩着退到穿堂的阴影中，同时看见瑞德那衬托在明亮的烛光背景中的巨大黑影。他摇摇晃晃地站在那里，嬷嬷好像还闻到他呼吸中的威士忌酒气。他低头看了看媚兰，挽起她的胳臂把她带进屋里，然后把门关上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the devil drove, Mammy could be as swift as a lithe black sixteen-year-old and her curiosity to get into Rhett's room made her work faster. But her hope turned to disappointment when Melly merely opened the door a crack and took the tray. For a long time Mammy strained her sharp ears but she could distinguish nothing except the clatter of silver on china, and the muffled soft tones of Melanie's voice. Then she heard the creaking of the bed as a heavy body fell upon it and, soon after, the sound of boots dropping to the floor. After an interval, Melanie appeared in the doorway but, strive though she might, Mammy could not see past her into the room. Melanie looked tired and there were tears glistening on her lashes but her face was serene again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦形势紧迫，嬷嬷是可以像个16岁的活泼黑人那样敏捷的，何况她很想到瑞德屋里去看看，所以行动起来就更迅速了。不过，她的希望破灭了，因为媚兰只把门开了一道缝，将盘子接过去又关了。于是，嬷嬷又侧耳细听了很久，但除了银餐具碰着瓷器的声音以及媚兰那模模糊糊的轻柔语调调外，仍然什么也听不清楚。后来她听见床架嘎吱一声响，显然有个沉重的身躯倒在床上，接着是靴子掉在地板上的声音。又过了一会，媚兰才出现在门口，但是嬷嬷无论怎样努力也没能越过她看见屋里的情景。媚兰显得很疲倦，眼睫毛上还闪着莹莹的泪花，不过脸色已平静了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="嬷嬷侧着身子偷偷挪动到门旁一把椅子跟前，将自己那胖得不成样子的身躯费劲地塞在里面。她静静地坐着，默默地哭泣和祈祷着，不进撩起衣襟来擦眼泪。她竭力侧耳细听，但听不清房里的话，只听到一些低低的断断续续的嗡嗡声。">查看中文翻译</div>
