<div class="line_en">There was no room left at any of the long tables, and more and more people were arriving to wait back of the wooden barricades by the cash register. People who had already got their trays of food wandered about between the tables in search of a spot they could squeeze into, or a place that somebody was about to leave, but there was no place. The roar of dishes, chairs, voices, shuffling feet, and the bra-a-ack of the turnstiles in the bare-walled room was like the din of a single huge machine.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese ate nervously, with the "Welcome to Frankenberg" booklet propped up in front of her against a sugar container. She had read the thick booklet through last week, in the first day of training class, but she had nothing else with her to read, and in the co-workers' cafeteria, she felt it necessary to concentrate on something. So she read again about vacation benefits, the three weeks' vacation given to people who had worked fifteen years at Frankenberg's, she ate the hot plate special of the day -- a grayish slice of roast beef with a ball of mashed potatoes covered with brown gravy, a heap of peas, and a tiny paper cup of horseradish. She tried to imagine what it would be like to have worked fifteen years in Frankenberg's department store, and she found she was unable to. "Twenty-five Yearers" got four weeks' vacation, the booklet said. Frankenberg's also provided a camp for summer and winter vacationers. They should have a church, too, she thought, and a hospital for the birth of babies. The store was organized so much like a prison, it frightened her now and then to realize she was a part of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝紧张地吃着午餐，眼前有本印着《欢迎来到法兰根堡》的小册子，正靠在糖罐子上。上礼拜员工训练的第一天，她就已经读完了这本厚厚的册子。但现在身旁没有其他东西可以读，而在员工餐厅里，她又觉得有必要专注于某件事情。因此，她又读了一遍假期福利的条款：凡是在法兰根堡工作满十五年的人，就有三周的假期。她吃着她那盘热腾腾的每日特餐，一片灰色的烤牛肉，配着一球上头淋着褐色肉汁的马铃薯泥，一堆豌豆，还有一小纸杯的辣根酱。她试着想像在法兰根堡百货公司工作十五年之后会是什么景象，但就是想不出来。小册子上写着“工作二十五年的员工可获得四周假期”。法兰根堡也有营地供夏季和冬季的度假者使用。她想，他们也应该设座教堂，或是接生小宝宝的医院。这家公司实在太井然有序了，就像监狱一样。她偶尔会惊觉，自己已经是其中一分子了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She glanced across the room at the windows and tried to think of something else. Of the beautiful black and red Norwegian sweater she had seen at Saks and might buy for Richard for Christmas, if she couldn't find a better-looking wallet than the ones she had seen for twenty dollars. Of the possibility of driving with the Kellys next Sunday up to West Point to see a hockey game. The great square window across the room looked like a painting by -- Who was it? Mondrian. The little square section of window in the corner open to a white sky. And no bird to fly in or out. What kind of a set would one make for a play that took place in a department store? She was back again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的目光横越过餐厅，望向窗子，脑里想着其他东西。她想着在萨克斯百货公司看到的那件红黑相间的挪威毛衣，样式很美，如果找不到比先前看到的二十元皮夹更好看的产品，那么圣诞节的时候她就要把这件毛衣买下来，当成礼物送给理查德。她想到下周日有可能和凯利一家开车到西点去看曲棍球赛。餐厅那头的方形大窗子看起来像谁的画呢？像蒙德里安的画[1]。窗角的小方形部分开着，迎向白色的天空，没有鸟儿飞进飞出。发生在百货公司里的一场戏应该搭配什么样的场景？她又回到那个问题了。【注：[1]彼埃·蒙德里安（Piet Mondrian，1872—1944），荷兰画家。风格派运动幕后艺术家和非具象绘画的创始者之一。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it's so different with you, Terry, Richard had said to her. You've got an absolute conviction you'll be out of it in a few weeks and the others haven't. Richard said she could be in France next summer. Would be. Richard wanted her to go with him, and there was really nothing that stood in the way of her going with him. And Richard's friend Phil McElroy had written him that he might be able to get her a job with a theatre group next month. Therese had not met Phil yet, but she had very little faith that he could get her a job. She had combed New York since September, gone back and combed it a few times more, and she hadn't found anything. Who gave a job in the middle of the winter to a stage designer apprentice just beginning to be an apprentice? It didn't seem real either that she might be in Europe with Richard next summer, sitting with him in sidewalk cafes, walking with him in Aries, finding the places Van Gogh had painted, she and Richard choosing towns to stop in for a while and paint. It seemed less real these last few days since she had been working at the store.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德曾经告诉她：“小芮，你跟别人都不一样。你确信你在那里做不了多久就会离开，但其他人却没这么想。”理查德说她隔年夏天人就会在法国，有可能吧。理查德希望她跟他一起去，其实也没有什么事会阻止她跟他一起去。理查德的朋友菲尔·麦克艾洛伊也写信告诉他，下个月他就有可能帮特芮丝找到剧团的工作。特芮丝还没见过菲尔，但她不太相信他能帮她找到工作。她从九月开始就找遍了纽约，后来又重新找了好几次，但什么也没找到。谁会在冬天过了一半的时候，雇用一个刚开始实习的舞台设计师？隔年夏天好像也不太可能和理查德一起去欧洲，陪他坐在露天咖啡厅里，和他在阿尔勒散步，找寻凡·高画过的地方。她和理查德不可能巡回一个又一个城镇作画。这几天她开始在百货公司上班之后，一切看来又更加不可能了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew what bothered her at the store. It was the sort of thing she wouldn't try to tell Richard. It was that the store intensified things that had always bothered her, as long as she could remember. It was the waste actions, the meaningless chores that seemed to keep her from doing what she wanted to do, might have done -- and here it was the complicated procedures with money bags, coat checkings, and time clocks that kept people even from serving the store as efficiently as they might -- the sense that everyone was incommunicado with everyone else and living on an entirely wrong plane, so that the meaning, the message, the love, or whatever it was that each life contained, never could find its expression. It reminded her of conversations at tables, on sofas, with people whose words seemed to hover over dead, unstirrable things, who never touched a string that played. And when one tried to touch a live string, looked at one with faces as masked as ever, making a remark so perfect in its banality that one could not even believe it might be subterfuge. And the loneliness, augmented by the fact one saw within the store the same faces day after day, the few faces one might have spoken to and never did, or never could. Not like the face on the passing bus that seems to speak, that is seen once and at least is gone forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她知道店里到底是什么让她心烦，就是那种她根本不想告诉理查德的事，就是这家百货公司使得长期困扰她的事更加恶化，那些没有意义的活动、没有意义的琐事，正在阻拦她，不让她做她想做的事，或者她可能去做的事。也就是那些现金袋、外套寄放、打卡钟这类的繁复程序，让员工无法发挥工作效率。那种人与人之间彼此无法接触，而且生活在完全不一样的平面上的感觉，使得每个人的生活内涵，无论是意义、讯息还是关爱，都无法传达出来。因此她想起了在桌上、在沙发上的交谈，彼此的话语似乎都围绕着宛若一池死水的事物打转，从未触及真正动人心弦的事。就算有人想要拨弄那条心弦，但只要看着一张张躲藏在面具底下的脸孔，发表连自己也不相信的陈腔滥调，到最后甚至无人怀疑这些话是假的了。还有寂寞，在同一家店日复一日看着同样的脸孔，更增添了寂寞。她应该可以对这几张脸孔说话，但她从来没有这样做，也可能永远无法这样做。那些脸孔不像经过的公车上似乎要倾诉些什么的脸孔，至少公车上的那些脸孔看过一次后就无缘再见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could see Sister Alicia's face, bony and reddish like pink stone when the sunlight was on it, and the starched blue billow of her bosom. Sister Alicia's big bony figure coming around a corner in a hall, between the white enamel tables in the refectory, Sister Alicia in a thousand places, her small blue eyes always finding her out among the other girls, seeing her differently, Therese knew, from all the other girls, yet the thin pink lips always set in the same straight line. She could see Sister Alicia handing her the knitted green gloves wrapped in tissue, not smiling, only presenting them to her directly, with hardly a word, on her eighth birthday. Sister Alicia telling her with the same straight mouth that she must pass her arithmetic. Who else had cared if she passed her arithmetic? Therese had kept the green gloves at the bottom of her tin locker at school, for years after Sister Alicia had gone away to California. The white tissue had become limp and crackle-less like ancient cloth, and still she had not worn the gloves. Finally, they were too small to wear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她仿佛可以看到艾莉西亚修女的脸孔，那是一张被阳光照到时，会显得瘦削而略带红色的脸孔，她也记得修女浆过的蓝色衣服上胸前的起伏之处。艾莉西亚修女瘦削的巨大身影出现在大厅的一角，就在食堂里面上了珐琅的白桌之间；艾莉西亚修女无所不在，她细小的蓝色眼睛总能在一大堆女孩中把她认出来。特芮丝知道，修女对她另眼相看，认为她与众不同，但修女粉红色的薄唇总是抿成一条直线。她回想起自己八岁生日那天，艾莉西亚修女不发一语，交给她一副包在薄纸里面的线织绿手套。修女面无表情，直接把手套交给她。她也回想起艾莉西亚修女同样抿成一条线的嘴巴，告诉她要多加油才能通过算术课。她的算术合不合格，其他人又有谁会在意？后来艾莉西亚修女远赴加州，多年来特芮丝还一直把那副绿手套放在学校置物柜的最底下。白色的薄纸已经皱成一团，花纹也早就磨平了，就像陈旧的布料一样。但她依旧没有戴过那副手套。最后，手套就小到戴不下了。">查看中文翻译</div>

The hands were chapped, there was dirt in the parallel creases of the knuckles, but the right hand bore a conspicuous silver filigree ring set with a clear green stone, the left a gold wedding ring, and there were traces of red polish in the corners of the nails. Therese watched the hand carry a forkful of peas upward, and she did not have to look at the face to know what it would be like.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nearly every morning when she came to work on the seventh floor, Therese would stop for a moment to watch a certain toy train. The train was on a table by itself near the elevators. It was not a big fine train like the one that ran on the floor at the back of the toy department, but there was a fury in its tiny pumping pistons that the bigger trains did not possess. Its wrath and frustration on the closed oval track held Therese spellbound.</div>

<div class="line_en">The little train was always running when she stepped out of the elevator in the morning, and when she finished work in the evening. She felt it cursed the hand that threw its switch each day. In the jerk of its nose around the curves, in its wild dashes down the straight lengths of track, she could see a frenzied and futile pursuit of a tyrannical master. It drew three Pullman cars in which minuscule human figures showed flinty profiles at the windows, behind these an open boxcar of real miniature lumber, a boxcar of coal that was not real, and a caboose that snapped round the curves and clung to the fleeing train like a child to its mother's skirts. It was like something gone mad in imprisonment, something already dead that would never wear out, like the dainty, springy-footed foxes in the Central Park Zoo, whose complex footwork repeated and repeated as they circled their cages.</div>

Mechanical toys began to toss balls into the air and catch them, shooting galleries popped and their targets rotated. The table of barnyard animals squawked, cackled, and brayed. Behind Therese, a weary rat-tat-tat -- tat-tat had started up, the drumbeats of the giant tin soldier who militantly faced the elevators and drummed all day. The arts and handicrafts table gave out a smell of fresh modeling clay, reminiscent of the art room at school when she was very small, and also of a kind of vault on the school grounds, rumored to be the real tomb of someone, that she had used to stick her nose into through iron bars.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no need of salesmanship. People wanted a doll, any doll, to give for Christmas. It was a matter of stooping, pulling out boxes in search of a doll with brown eyes instead of blue, calling Mrs. Hendrickson to open a showcase window with her key, which she did grudgingly if she were convinced the particular doll could not be found in stock, a matter of sidling down the aisle behind the counter to deposit a purchased doll on the mountain of boxes on the wrapping counter that was always growing, always toppling, no matter how often the stock boys came to take the packages away. Almost no children came to the counter. Santa Claus was supposed to bring the dolls, Santa Claus represented by the frantic faces and the clawing hands. Yet there must be a certain good will in all of them, Therese thought, even behind the cool, powdered faces of the women in mink and sable, who were generally the most arrogant, who hastily bought the biggest and most expensive dolls, the dolls with real hair and changes of clothing. There was surely love in the poor people, who waited their turn and asked quietly how much a certain doll cost, and shook their heads regretfully and turned away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese's lips opened to speak, but her mind was too far away. Her mind was at a distant point, at a distant vortex that opened on the scene in the dimly lighted, terrifying room where the two of them seemed to stand in desperate combat. And at the point of the vortex where her mind was, she knew it was the hopelessness that terrified her and nothing else. It was the hopelessness of Mrs. Robichek's ailing body and her job at the store, of her stack of dresses in the trunk, of her ugliness, the hopelessness of which the end of her life was entirely composed. And the hopelessness of herself, of ever being the person she wanted to be and of doing the things that person would do. Had all her life been nothing but a dream, and was this real? It was the terror of this hopelessness that made her want to shed the dress and flee before it was too late, before the chains fell around her and locked.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was hot. The radiator hissed. The room smelled of garlic and the fustiness of old age, of medicines, and of the peculiar metallic smell that was Mrs. Robichek's own. Therese wanted to collapse in the chair where her skirt and sweater lay. Perhaps if she lay on her own clothing, she thought, it wouldn't matter. But she shouldn't lie down at all. If she did, she was lost. The chains would lock, and she would be one with the hunchback.</div>

<div class="line_en">A line from Richard's Eliot came to Therese. That is not what I meant at all. That is not it, at all. She wanted to say it, but she could not make her lips move. Something sweet and burning was in her mouth. Mrs. Robichek was standing in front of her, spooning something from a bottle, and pushing the spoon between her lips. Therese swallowed it obediently, not caring if it were poison. She could have moved her lips now, could have gotten up from the chair, but she didn't want to move. Finally, she lay back in the chair, and let Mrs. Robichek cover her with the blanket, and she pretended to go to sleep. But all the while she watched the humpbacked figure moving about the room, putting away the things from the table, undressing for bed. She watched Mrs. Robichek remove a big laced corset and then a strap device that passed around her shoulders and partially down her back. Therese closed her eyes then in horror, pressed them tight shut, until the creaking of a spring and a long groaning sigh told her that Mrs. Robichek had gone to bed. But that was not all. Mrs. Robichek reached for the alarm clock and wound it, and without lifting her head from the pillow, groped with the clock for the straight chair beside the bed. In the dark, Therese could barely see her arm rise and fall four times before the clock found the chair.</div>
