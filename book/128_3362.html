<div class="line_en">I walked all the way back to the hotel. Forty-one gorgeous blocks. I didn't do it because I felt like walking or anything. It was more because I didn't feel like getting in and out of another taxicab. Sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way you get tired riding in elevators. All of a sudden, you have to walk, no matter how far or how high up. When I was a kid, I used to walk all the way up to our apartment very frequently. Twelve stories.</div>

<div class="line_en">You wouldn't even have known it had snowed at all. There was hardly any snow on the sidewalks. But it was freezing cold, and I took my red hunting hat out of my pocket and put it on -- I didn't give a damn how I looked. I even put the earlaps down. I wished I knew who'd swiped my gloves at Pencey, because my hands were freezing. Not that I'd have done much about it even if I had known. I'm one of these very yellow guys. I try not to show it, but I am. For instance, if I'd found out at Pencey who'd stolen my gloves, I probably would've gone down to the crook's room and said, "Okay. How 'bout handing over those gloves?" Then the crook that had stolen them probably would've said, his voice very innocent and all, "What gloves?" Then what I probably would've done, I'd have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere. Hidden in his goddam galoshes or something, for instance. I'd have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said, "I suppose these are your goddam gloves?" Then the crook probably would've given me this very phony, innocent look, and said, "I never saw those gloves before in my life. If they're yours, take 'em. I don't want the goddam things."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I probably would've just stood there for about five minutes. I'd have the damn gloves right in my hand and all, but I'd feel I ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something -- break his goddam jaw. Only, I wouldn't have the guts to do it. I'd just stand there, trying to look tough. What I might do, I might say something very cutting and snotty, to rile him up -- instead of socking him in the jaw. Anyway if I did say something very cutting and snotty, he'd probably get up and come over to me and say, "Listen, Caulfield. Are you calling me a crook?" Then, instead of saying, "You're goddam right I am, you dirty crooked bastard!" all I probably would've said would be, "All I know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes." Right away then, the guy would know for sure that I wasn't going to take a sock at him, and he probably would've said, "Listen. Let's get this straight. Are you calling me a thief?" Then I probably would've said, "Nobody's calling anybody a thief. All I know is my gloves were in your goddam galoshes." It could go on like that for hours.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, though, I'd leave his room without even taking a sock at him. I'd probably go down to the can and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror. Anyway, that's what I thought about the whole way back to the hotel. It's no fun to be yellow. Maybe I'm not all yellow. I don't know. I think maybe I'm just partly yellow and partly the type that doesn't give much of a damn if they lose their gloves. One of my troubles is, I never care too much when I lose something -- it used to drive my mother crazy when I was a kid. Some guys spend days looking for something they lost. I never seem to have anything that if I lost it I'd care too much. Maybe that's why I'm partly yellow. It's no excuse, though. It really isn't. What you should be is not yellow at all. If you're supposed to sock somebody in the jaw, and you sort of feel like doing it, you should do it. I'm just no good at it, though. I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I hate fist fights. I don't mind getting hit so much -- although I'm not crazy about it, naturally -- but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy's face. I can't stand looking at the other guy's face, is my trouble. It wouldn't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something. It's a funny kind of yellowness, when you come to think of it, but it's yellowness, all right. I'm not kidding myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可我最后离开的时候，甚至都不会碰他一下。我大概会到盥洗室里，偷偷袖一支烟，在镜子里看着自己装出凶狠的样子。嗯，这就是我回旅馆时一路上想的心事。当个胆小鬼决不是什么好玩的事儿。也许我并不完完全全是个胆小鬼。我不知道。我想也许我只是一半出于胆小，一半出于丢了副手套什么的并不他妈的在乎。我有这么个缺点，就是不管丢了什么东西都不在乎――我小时候我母亲就常常为这事气得发疯。有些人要是丢了东西，不借花几天工夫到处寻找。我好象从来就不曾有过什么好东西丢了以后会着急得要命。或许这就是我一半胆小的原因。不过这不是给自己开脱的理由。的确不是。一个人压根儿就不应该胆小。你要是应该往谁的下巴额儿上揍一拳，心里如果想揍，就应该动手揍。可我就是下不了手。我宁可把一个人推出窗口，或者用斧头砍下他的脑瓜儿，也不愿拿拳头揍他的下巴额儿。我最恨跟人动拳头。我倒不在乎自己挨揍――尽管我并不乐于挨揍，自然啦――可是用拳头打架的时候我最害怕对方的脸。我的问题是，我不忍看对方的脸。要是双方都蒙住眼睛什么的，那倒还可以。你要是仔细一想，这确是种可笑的胆小，不过照样是胆小，一点不假。我决不自欺欺人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, before I got to the hotel, I started to go in this dumpy-looking bar, but two guys came out, drunk as hell, and wanted to know where the subway was. One of them was this very Cuban-looking guy, and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my face while I gave him directions. I ended up not even going in the damn bar. I just went back to the hotel.</div>

I can drink all night and not even show it, if I'm in the mood. Once, at the Whooton School, this other boy, Raymond Goldfarb, and I bought a pint of Scotch and drank it in the chapel one Saturday night, where nobody'd see us. He got stinking, but I hardly didn't even show it. I just got very cool and nonchalant. I puked before I went to bed, but I didn't really have to -- I forced myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went to my room and put some water on my hair, but you can't really comb a crew cut or anything. Then I tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and the Scotch and sodas I drank at Ernie's. All you do is hold your hand under your mouth and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils. It didn't seem to stink much, but I brushed my teeth anyway. Then I put on another clean shirt. I knew I didn't have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything, but it sort of gave me something to do. I was a little nervous. I was starting to feel pretty sexy and all, but I was a little nervous anyway. If you want to know the truth, I'm a virgin. I really am. I've had quite a few opportunities to lose my virginity and all, but I've never got around to it yet. Something always happens. For instance, if you're at a girl's house, her parents always come home at the wrong time -- or you're afraid they will. Or if you're in the back seat of somebody's car, there's always somebody's date in the front seat -- some girl, I mean -- that always wants to know what's going on all over the whole goddam car. I mean some girl in front keeps turning around to see what the hell's going on. Anyway, something always happens. I came quite close to doing it a couple of times, though. One time in particular, I remember. Something went wrong, though -- I don't even remember what any more. The thing is, most of the time when you're coming pretty close to doing it with a girl -- a girl that isn't a prostitute or anything, I mean -- she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with me is, I stop. Most guys don't. I can't help it. You never know whether they really want you to stop, or whether they're just scared as hell, or whether they're just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it, the blame'll be on you, not them. Anyway, I keep stopping. The trouble is, I get to feeling sorry for them. I mean most girls are so dumb and all. After you neck them for a while, you can really watch them losing their brains. You take a girl when she really gets passionate, she just hasn't any brains. I don't know. They tell me to stop, so I stop. I always wish I hadn't, after I take them home, but I keep doing it anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回到房里往头发上敷了些水，可是在水手式的平头上实在梳不出什么名堂来。接着我想起在欧尼夜总会里抽了那么些烟，又喝了威士忌和苏打水，就试了试自己的嘴里有没有臭味。你只要把手放到嘴下面，对准鼻孔呼气，就闻得出自己嘴里有没有臭味。我嘴里的味儿倒不大，可我还是刷了刷牙。接着我又换了件干净衬衫。我知道自己用不着为了个妓女把身上打扮得象个布娃娃似的，不过这样我总算有事可做了。我有点儿紧张。我的欲念开始上来了，可我也有点儿紧张。我老实跟你说，我原来还是个童男哩。我真的是个童男。我倒有几次机会可以失去我的童贞，可我始终没失去。总是有什么事情发生。比方说，你要是在女朋友的家里，她的父母总会突然回家――或者你害怕他们会突然回家。或者你要是在别人汽车里的后座上，那么前座上总有什么人――或是说有什么姑娘――老想知道整个混帐汽车里在干些什么。我是说前座上总有个始娘老回过头来看看后面在他妈的干些什么。不管怎样，反正总有什么事发生。有一两次，我只差一点儿就上手了。特别是有一次，我记得。可后来出了什么事――我都记不得到底出什么事了。问题是，每当你要跟一个姑娘行事的时候――我是说不是个做妓女什么的姑娘――十有九次她总不住地叫你住手。我的问题是，每次我都住手了。大多数男人都不这样。我却由不得自己。你总拿不准她们是真正要你住手呢，还是她们害怕得要命，还是她们故意要你住手，万一你真的干了那事，那么过错就都在你身上，她们可以脱掉干系。不管怎样，每次我都住手了。问题是，我心里真有点儿替她们难受。我是说大多数姑娘都那么傻。你只要跟她们搂搂抱抱一会儿，就可以真正看出她们全都失去了头脑。一个姑娘只要真正热情上来，就不再有头脑。我不知道。她们要我住手，我就住手了。我送她们回家以后，总后悔自己不该住手，可到时候又总是老毛病发作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, while I was putting on another clean shirt, I sort of figured this was my big chance, in a way. I figured if she was a prostitute and all, I could get in some practice on her, in case I ever get married or anything. I worry about that stuff sometimes. I read this book once, at the Whooton School, that had this very sophisticated, suave, sexy guy in it. Monsieur Blanchard was his name, I can still remember. It was a lousy book, but this Blanchard guy was pretty good. He had this big château and all on the Riviera, in Europe, and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club. He was a real rake and all, but he knocked women out. He said, in this one part, that a woman's body is like a violin and all, and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right. It was a very corny book -- I realize that -- but I couldn't get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway. In a way, that's why I sort of wanted to get some practice in, in case I ever get married. Caulfield and his Magic Violin, boy. It's corny, I realize, but it isn't too corny. I wouldn't mind being pretty good at that stuff. Half the time, if you really want to know the truth, when I'm horsing around with a girl, I have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what I'm looking for, for God's sake, if you know what I mean. Take this girl that I just missed having sexual intercourse with, that I told you about. It took me about an hour to just get her goddam brassière off. By the time I did get it off, she was about ready to spit in my eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，我在穿另一件干净衬衫的时候，心里暗忖，这倒是我最好的一个机会。我揣摩她既是个妓女，我可以从她那儿取得一些经验，在我结婚后也许用得着。有时候我可真担心这玩艺儿。在胡敦中学的时候，我有一次看到一本书，里面讲一个非常世故、非常和蔼可亲、非常好色的家伙。他的名字叫勃朗夏德先生，我还记得。这是一本坏书，可勃朗夏德这个人物倒是写得不错。他在欧洲里维耶拉河上有一座大城堡，空闲时他总是拿根棍子把一些女人打跑。他是个真正的浪子，可很使女人着迷。他在书的某一章里说女人的身体很象个小提琴，需要一个大音乐家才能演奏出好音乐。这是本粗俗不堪的书――我知道这一点――可我怎么也忘不掉那个小提琴的比喻。我之所以想取得些经验，以备结婚后应用，说来也是如此。考尔菲德和他的魔提琴，嘿。这有点粗俗，我知道，可也不算太粗俗。我不在乎自己在这玩艺儿上成为老手。如果你真要我说老实话，我可以告诉你说当我跟一个女人一起胡搞的时候，有多半时间我都他妈的找不到我所寻找的东西，要是你懂得我意思的话。就拿刚才我说的那个差点儿跟我发生关系的姑娘来说吧。我差不多花了一个小时才把她的奶罩脱掉。到了我真正把它脱掉的时候，她都准备往我的脸上吐唾沫了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed. She had on a green dress underneath. Then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down. She crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down. She was very nervous, for a prostitute. She really was. I think it was because she was young as hell. She was around my age. I sat down in the big chair, next to her, and offered her a cigarette. "I don't smoke," she said. She had a tiny little wheeny-whiny voice. You could hardly hear her. She never said thank you, either, when you offered her something. She just didn't know any better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她进房后马上脱下大衣，往床上一扔。她里面穿着件绿衣服。她斜坐在那把跟房间里的书桌配成一套的椅子上，开始颠动她的一只脚。她把一条腿搁在另一条腿上，开始颠动搁在上面的那只脚。对一个妓女来说，她的举止似乎过于紧张。她确实紧张。我想那是因为她年轻得要命的缘故。她跟我差不多年纪。我在她旁边的一把大椅子上坐下，递给她一支香烟。“我不抽烟，”她说。她说起话来哼哼卿卿的，声音很小。你甚至都听不见她说的什么。你请她抽烟什么的，她也从来不说声谢谢。她完全是出于无知。">查看中文翻译</div>
