<div class="line_en">We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay rightly called, though I reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">My acquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its agitation.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was why I had now given to Mrs. Grose's steps so marked a direction -- a direction that made her, when she perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly mystified.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是为什么我现在领着格罗斯太太，向一个如此明确的方向走。当她意识到这个方向时，她迟疑不前，这表明她又遇到了新的迷惑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home. She had not given me the slip for any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that I had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to which she most inclined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们通常都在离家半英里的地方上船，但我深信，无论弗洛拉现在身在何处，都不会离家太近。她从来没有为了任何小小的冒险从我这里溜走过，而且，自从我和她在池塘边一起经历了很不寻常的事情那天起，我就在我们散步的时候，就特别注意她最倾向于往哪个方向走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, thank you!" my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I went straight on without her. By the time I reached the pool, however, she was close behind me, and I knew that, whatever, to her apprehension, might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as her least danger. She exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in sight of the greater part of the water without a sight of the child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，谢谢你！”我的朋友叫道，听到这里，她好像被钉住了，我便撇下她径直往前走。但当我到池塘边时，她紧跟在我后面。我知道，在她看来，无论什么事情可能降临到我头上，我的陪伴能使她的危险降至最低。最后，大部分水域展现在我们面前时，却没见那个孩子的踪影，这时，她释然地舒了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant compared to its length that, with its ends out of view, it might have been taken for a scant river. We looked at the empty expanse, and then I felt the suggestion of my friend's eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="池塘是长方形的，它的宽度跟长度比起来小得微不足道，你看不到它的尽头，所以它可能会被看成是一条小河。我们望着空荡荡的水面，随后我感觉到了我朋友的眼睛正向我示意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came down to the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在近岸没有弗洛拉的踪影，而在对岸，也不见她的踪影，只有一片大约延伸到水里20码的茂密灌木丛，这让我大为吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no; wait! She has taken the boat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，等等！她弄走了船。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knew what she meant and I replied with a negative headshake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道她是什么意思，作为回答，我否定地摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across the lake. "Then where is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的同伴凝视着空荡荡的泊位，然后目光又掠过湖面。“那么船在哪里呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. She has used it to go over, and then has managed to hide it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们看不到船就是最强有力的证据。她划着船去了对岸，然后设法把它藏了起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All alone -- that child?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个孩子——独自一人做了这一切？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's not alone, and at such times she's not a child: she's an old, old woman." I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose took again, into the queer element I offered her, one of her plunges of submission; then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump of trees growing close to the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她不是独自一人，而且这个时候她不是一个孩子——她是一个成熟的老女人。”我扫视着可以望到的湖岸，格罗斯太太带着疑惑再次接受了我给她的古怪说法。随后我又指出，小船可能刚好泊在由池塘的凹陷处形成的隐蔽处，从岸这边看，那个凹陷地被河岸的投影和生长在水边的树丛掩盖起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那正是我们必须要弄清楚的。”我开始继续前行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Laws!" cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much for her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got halfway round -- a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by a path choked with overgrowth -- I paused to give her breath. I sustained her with a grateful arm, assuring her that she might hugely help me; and this started us afresh, so that in the course of but few minutes more we reached a point from which we found the boat to be where I had supposed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪！”我的朋友再次叫道。我的一连串推理总是让她吃不消。尽管这样，她还是吃力地紧紧跟在我后面，在我们走了半圈后——这是一段曲折的、令人疲倦的路程，路面凹凸不平，路上杂草丛生——我停下来让她喘口气。我用一只手带着感激地扶着她，让她相信她能帮我很大的忙。短暂的休憩让我们恢复了体力，所以没几分钟我们就走到一个地方，在那里我们发现，小船就在我所推测的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But if the boat's there, where on earth's SHE?" my colleague anxiously asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是如果船在那里，弗洛拉到底在哪里呢？”我的同伴焦急地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight and was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just there, down to the brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小船被人故意停在尽量远离人们视线的地方，拴在一个篱笆桩上，篱笆就从那里延伸到岸边，可以借助它上岸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Certainly, far as it is. It will take us but ten minutes, but it's far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight over."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然了，虽然挺远。这仅仅会花我们十分钟，但却远得足以让这孩子放弃步行。她直接划过去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short, thick oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the feat for a little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我看到那双短而厚重的桨被很安全地架在那里时，我意识到了一个小女孩的惊人技艺。不过到目前为止，我已经在惊奇之中生活太长时间了，也曾目睹太多鲜活的把戏，应接不暇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, "There she is!" we both exclaimed at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她在那里！”我们两个立即惊叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I instantly became sure she had just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself taking a step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently approached her. She smiled and smiled, and we met; but it was all done in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立刻变得确定：她刚刚从那片灌木丛中出来。她等着我们，自己没有挪步。我们走近她时，脸上带着少有的严肃。她一直微笑着，我们碰头了，但在这罪恶的不祥时刻，一切都在沉默中进行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a gate in the fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling interval, more into the open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="篱笆上开了个门，我们穿过那里，在一小段路程之后，眼前开阔许多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Grose was the first to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender, yielding body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格罗斯太太第一个打破了这个魔咒：她突然跪了下去，把那个孩子拉到怀里，久久地紧抱着那个幼弱、顺从的身躯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Flora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as if her performance was now complete. The next thing she did, however, was to stoop straight down and pluck -- quite as if it were all she was there for -- a big, ugly spray of withered fern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗洛拉在不远处的草坪上，站在我们面前微笑着，仿佛她的表演此时圆满结束了。然而，接下来她做的事情是，弯下腰拔起一大把枯萎了的、难看的蕨类植物——好像这就是她到那里的目的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="尽管如此，除了弗洛拉把她那丑陋的蕨类植物又扔到地上之外，这期间我俩之间什么都没有发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What she and I had virtually said to each other was that pretexts were useless now. When Mrs. Grose finally got up she kept the child's hand, so that the two were still before me; and the singular reticence of our communion was even more marked in the frank look she launched me. "I'll be hanged!" it said, "if I'll speak!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，她和我对彼此所说过的话，现在都成了无用的借口。当格罗斯太太最终站起来时，她拉着那个孩子的一只手，所以，她们俩仍然在我面前。她坦白地看着我，我们之间的交流因而尤其奇特而沉默。“我会被绞死的！”她的眼神好像在说，“如果我说出来！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only watch it -- which I did the more intently when I saw Flora's face peep at me over our companion's shoulder. It was serious now -- the flicker had left it; but it strengthened the pang with which I at that moment envied Mrs. Grose the simplicity of HER relation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我静静地注视着眼前这无言的一幕——当我发现弗洛拉在格罗斯太太的肩膀上偷瞄我时，我更加专心地看着她。现在事情严重起来了——震撼已离去，但那一刻，我的悲痛加剧了，我嫉妒格罗斯太太和弗洛拉之间这么朴素的关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where yours are, my dear!" I promptly returned. She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient. "And where's Miles?" she went on.</div>
