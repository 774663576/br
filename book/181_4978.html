<div class="line_en">Just as Mr Beaver had been repeating the rhyme about Adam's flesh and Adam's bone Edmund had been very quietly turning the doorhandle; and just before Mr Beaver had begun telling them that the White Witch wasn't really human at all but half a Jinn and half a giantess, Edmund had got outside into the snow and cautiously closed the door behind him.</div>

<div class="line_en">AND now of course you want to know what had happened to Edmund. He had eaten his share of the dinner, but he hadn't really enjoyed it because he was thinking all the time about Turkish Delight -- and there's nothing that spoils the taste of good ordinary food half so much as the memory of bad magic food. And he had heard the conversation, and hadn't enjoyed it much either, because he kept on thinking that the others were taking no notice of him and trying to give him the cold shoulder. They weren't, but he imagined it. And then he had listened until Mr Beaver told them about Aslan and until he had heard the whole arrangement for meeting Aslan at the Stone Table. It was then that he began very quietly to edge himself under the curtain which hung over the door. For the mention of Aslan gave him a mysterious and horrible feeling just as it gave the others a mysterious and lovely feeling.</div>

<div class="line_en">You mustn't think that even now Edmund was quite so bad that he actually wanted his brother and sisters to be turned into stone. He did want Turkish Delight and to be a Prince (and later a King) and to pay Peter out for calling him a beast. As for what the Witch would do with the others, he didn't want her to be particularly nice to them -- certainly not to put them on the same level as himself; but he managed to believe, or to pretend he believed, that she wouldn't do anything very bad to them, "Because," he said to himself, "all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it isn't true. She was jolly nice to me, anyway, much nicer than they are. I expect she is the rightful Queen really. Anyway, she'll be better than that awful Aslan!" At least, that was the excuse he made in his own mind for what he was doing. It wasn't a very good excuse, however, for deep down inside him he really knew that the White Witch was bad and cruel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使到了这会儿，你们也千万别认为爱德蒙坏得真正想让他的兄弟姐妹被妖婆变成石头。他的确想吃土耳其软糖，而且想当王子（日后当个国王），还想出出彼得骂他坏蛋这口恶气。至于妖婆会怎么对待其他人，他虽不希望她对他们特别好——当然不能给他们和他同等待遇——但他竟然相信，或者是自以为相信，她不会对他们干出什么坏事。“因为，”他暗自说，“凡是说她坏话的人都是她的敌人，也许这些坏话里面有一半都是假的。不管怎么说，她对我挺好的、比他们待我要好多了。我当她真正是合法的女王。无论如何，她总比可恶的阿斯兰要好吧！”至少，这就是他脑子里为自己所干的事找的借口。不过这个借口并不高明，因为在他内心深处，他也真正知道白妖婆又凶狠又残酷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing he realized when he got outside and found the snow falling all round him, was that he had left his coat behind in the Beavers' house. And of course there was no chance of going back to get it now. The next thing he realized was that the daylight was almost gone, for it had been nearly three o'clock when they sat down to dinner and the winter days were short. He hadn't reckoned on this; but he had to make the best of it. So he turned up his collar and shuffled across the top of the dam (luckily it wasn't so slippery since the snow had fallen) to the far side of the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他出来后看到外面正在下雪，首先明白过来的是他把自己的大衣扔在海狸夫妇家里了。眼下当然没有机会回去拿大衣。其次明白过来的是天几乎黑了，因为他们坐下来吃午饭时已经快三点了，而且冬天的白昼短。他原先没估计到这一点，但他得充分利用这一点。所以他竖起衣领，拖着脚步，穿过堤坝顶部（幸亏下了雪，上面才没那么滑），向远处河边走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was pretty bad when he reached the far side. It was growing darker every minute and what with that and the snowflakes swirling all round him he could hardly see three feet ahead. And then too there was no road. He kept slipping into deep drifts of snow, and skidding on frozen puddles, and tripping over fallen tree-trunks, and sliding down steep banks, and barking his shins against rocks, till he was wet and cold and bruised all over. The silence and the loneliness were dreadful. In fact I really think he might have given up the whole plan and gone back and owned up and made friends with the others, if he hadn't happened to say to himself, "When I'm King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads." And of course that set him off thinking about being a King and all the other things he would do and this cheered him up a good deal. He had just settled in his mind what sort of palace he would have and how many cars and all about his private cinema and where the principal railways would run and what laws he would make against beavers and dams and was putting the finishing touches to some schemes for keeping Peter in his place, when the weather changed. First the snow stopped. Then a wind sprang up and it became freezing cold. Finally, the clouds rolled away and the moon came out. It was a full moon and, shining on all that snow, it made everything almost as bright as day -- only the shadows were rather confusing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他到了远处的河边，情况就不大妙了。天一点点变黑，再加上雪花围着他打转，他连三英尺以外都看不清。再说，那儿没有路。他老是滑到深深的雪堆里，滚到结了冰的水潭里，绊在倒下的树干上，从陡峭的河岸上滑下去，小腿在岩石上擦破了皮，弄得浑身又湿又冷，到处是伤。寂静和孤独是可怕的。其实，要不是他偶尔对自己说，“等我当上纳尼亚国王，我首先要干的事就是修几条像样的路。”我真以为他可能会放弃整个计划，回去认个错，跟其他人和好呢。当然这句话使他想到当国王以及他要干的一切事情，这就大大鼓舞了他。他在脑子里拿定主意要有什么样的王宫，有多少汽车，以及种种有关私人电影院的事，主要的铁路往哪儿开，他要针对海狸和堤坝制定什么法律加以限制，还把不准彼得乱说乱动的计划作了最后修改；这时天变了。先是雪停了，接着突然刮起一阵风，冷得要命；最后，云散了，月亮出来了。一轮明月照在一片白雪上，几乎跟白天一样亮——只是那些阴影把他搞得糊里糊涂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He would never have found his way if the moon hadn't come out by the time he got to the other river you remember he had seen (when they first arrived at the Beavers') a smaller river flowing into the great one lower down. He now reached this and turned to follow it up. But the little valley down which it came was much steeper and rockier than the one he had just left and much overgrown with bushes, so that he could not have managed it at all in the dark. Even as it was, he got wet through for he had to stoop under branches and great loads of snow came sliding off on to his back. And every time this happened he thought more and more how he hated Peter -- just as if all this had been Peter's fault.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要不是在他到达另一条河的时候月亮出来了，他根本就找不到路——你们记得，他们刚到海狸夫妇家时，他已经看到了一条小一点的河在下游汇入这条大河。如今他走到这条小河边，就转身沿着这河往上游走。不过小河源头的那个小山谷比他刚刚离开的那个山谷更陡峭，岩石更多，而且满地都是枝叶丛生的灌木，因此他在黑暗中根本没法过去。尽管这样，他也弄得浑身透湿，因为他得弯着腰在树枝下走，大块大块的雪就都滑到他背上了。碰上这种倒霉事，他就格外想自己多么恨彼得——好像这一切都是彼得的错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at last he came to a part where it was more level and the valley opened out. And there, on the other side of the river, quite close to him, in the middle of a little plain between two hills, he saw what must be the White Witch's House. And the moon was shining brighter than ever. The House was really a small castle. It seemed to be all towers; little towers with long pointed spires on them, sharp as needles. They looked like huge dunce's caps or sorcerer's caps. And they shone in the moonlight and their long shadows looked strange on the snow. Edmund began to be afraid of the House.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他终于走到一块比较平坦的地方，山谷也开阔起来。就在离他很近的地方，小河的另一边，两座小山当中一块小平原的中央，他看见了那幢想必属于白妖婆的房子。而且月亮也比任何时候都更明亮。那幢房子其实是一座小城堡，看上去全是塔楼。小小的塔楼上面是又长又尖的顶，像针尖，又像笨蛋学生或巫师戴的尖角帽。在月光照耀下，塔楼长长的影子在雪地上显得古里古怪的！爱德蒙对这幢房子开始感到害怕了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was too late to think of turning back now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过这会儿想转身回去也太晚了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He crossed the river on the ice and walked up to the House. There was nothing stirring; not the slightest sound anywhere. Even his own feet made no noise on the deep newly fallen snow. He walked on and on, past corner after corner of the House, and past turret after turret to find the door. He had to go right round to the far side before he found it. It was a huge arch but the great iron gates stood wide open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他踏在冰上走过了河，一直走向这幢房子。没有一点动静，连他自己两只脚踩在刚下的深深的雪里也没有声音。他走啊走啊，走过一个又一个墙角、一个又一个塔楼去找门。他绕了一大圈才找到门。原来是座大拱门，不过大铁门是敞开的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmund crept up to the arch and looked inside into the courtyard, and there he saw a sight that nearly made his heart stop beating. Just inside the gate, with the moonlight shining on it, stood an enormous lion crouched as if it was ready to spring. And Edmund stood in the shadow of the arch, afraid to go on and afraid to go back, with his knees knocking together. He stood there so long that his teeth would have been chattering with cold even if they had not been chattering with fear. How long this really lasted I don't know, but it seemed to Edmund to last for hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙蹑手蹑脚走进拱门，朝院子里张望，看见的那副情景差点使他的心都停止跳动了。就在大门里面，月光照耀下，有一只大狮子蹲在那儿，好像准备跳起来似的。爱德蒙就站在拱门的阴影里，两膝直打哆嗦，又怕走过去，又怕走回来。他站在那儿好久好久，牙齿即使不是怕得打战也早巳冷得打战了。我不知道他在那儿真正站了多久，不过爱德蒙似乎觉得过了好几个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so still -- for it hadn't moved one inch since he first set eyes on it. Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in the shadow of the arch as much as he could. He now saw from the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been looking at him at all. ("But supposing it turns its head?" thought Edmund.) In fact it was staring at something else namely a little: dwarf who stood with his back to it about four feet away. "Aha!" thought Edmund. "When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape." But still the lion never moved, nor did the dwarf. And now at last Edmund remembered what the others had said about the White Witch turning people into stone. Perhaps this was only a stone lion. And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that the lion's back and the top of its head were covered with snow. Of course it must be only a statue! No living animal would have let itself get covered with snow. Then very slowly and with his heart beating as if it would burst, Edmund ventured to go up to the lion. Even now he hardly dared to touch it, but at last he put out his hand, very quickly, and did. It was cold stone. He had been frightened of a mere statue!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来他终于想知道那狮子干吗蹲着一动也不动——因为自从他看见它以来，它就纹丝儿没动过。这会儿爱德蒙放大胆走近点，一边仍然尽量躲在拱门的阴影里。他现在从狮子站的架势看出，它根本不可能看见他。（“但假如它转过头来呢？”爱德蒙想道。）事实上它正盯着另外什么东西——就是一个小矮人，他背对狮子站在大约四英尺以外的地方。“啊哈！”爱德蒙想，“等它扑向那小矮人，那时就是我逃命的机会了。”但狮子仍然一动也不动，小矮人也一样。爱德蒙这时终于想起其他人说过的白妖婆把人变成石头的事。也许这只是一只石狮吧。他一想到这点就注意到狮子背上和头顶上都积满了雪。它当然一定只是个石像！活生生的动物决不会让自己身上积满雪的。于是，爱德蒙慢慢大着胆向狮子走去，一颗心好像要跳出来似的。即使现在他也不大敢摸它，但他终于伸出手来很快地摸了一下。原来是冰冷的石头。只不过是个石像，竟然就把他吓住了！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And he stood there gloating over the stone lion, and presently he did something very silly and childish. He took a stump of lead pencil out of his pocket and scribbled a moustache on the lion's upper lip and then a pair of spectacles on its eyes. Then he said, "Yah! Silly old Aslan! How do you like being a stone? You thought yourself mighty fine, didn't you?" But in spite of the scribbles on it the face of the great stone beast still looked so terrible, and sad, and noble, staring up in the moonlight, that Edmund didn't really get any fun out of jeering at it. He turned away and began to cross the courtyard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他就这么站在那儿幸灾乐祸地看着石狮子，不一会儿他干了一件孩子气的蠢事。他从口袋里掏出一个铅笔头，在狮子上唇涂上两撇胡子，还给它加上了一副眼镜。涂罢他说，“可笑的老阿斯兰！成了石头你有什么想法啊？你自以为很了不起吧？”不过尽管他在狮子脸上乱涂，大石兽看上去仍然很可怕，又伤心，又高贵，目光仰望着月亮。爱德蒙戏弄石狮，却并没因此真正感到好玩。他掉转身子，穿过院子走进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The relief which Edmund felt was so great that in spite of the cold he suddenly got warm all over right down to his toes, and at the same time there came into his head what seemed a perfectly lovely idea. "Probably," he thought, "this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about. She's caught him already and turned him into stone. So that's the end of all their fine ideas about him! Pooh! Who's afraid of Aslan?"</div>

<div class="line_en">As he got into the middle of it he saw that there were dozens of statues all about -- standing here and there rather as the pieces stand on a chess-board when it is half-way through the game. There were stone satyrs, and stone wolves, and bears and foxes and cat-amountains of stone. There were lovely stone shapes that looked like women but who were really the spirits of trees. There was the great shape of a centaur and a winged horse and a long lithe creature that Edmund took to be a dragon. They all looked so strange standing there perfectly life-like and also perfectly still, in the bright cold moonlight, that it was eerie work crossing the courtyard. Right in the very middle stood a huge shape like a man, but as tall as a tree, with a fierce face and a shaggy beard and a great club in its right hand. Even though he knew that it was only a stone giant and not a live one, Edmund did not like going past it.</div>
