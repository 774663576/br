<div class="line_en">We went to this shoe store. As we were shopping, Kaitlyn kept picking out all these open-toed flats for me and saying, "These would look cute on you," which reminded me that Kaitlyn never wore open-toed shoes on account of how she hated her feet because she felt her second toes were too long, as if the second toe was a window into the soul or something. So when I pointed out a pair of sandals that would suit her skin tone, she was like, "Yeah, but…" the but being but they will expose my hideous second toes to the public, and I said, "Kaitlyn, you're the only person I've ever known to have toe-specific dysmorphia," and she said, "What is that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们去了一家鞋店。一边逛，凯特琳一边不停挑出各种露趾平底鞋给我说：“你穿这双一定很可爱！”这让我想起凯特琳自己从来不穿露出脚指头的鞋子，因为她讨厌自己的脚，觉得第二个脚趾太长了，就好像二脚趾是心灵的窗户之类似的。所以，每次我指给她看一双跟她肤色相衬的凉鞋，她就会说：“不错，可是……”可是的意思是“可是这鞋会把我丑陋的二脚趾公之于众”。我说：“凯特琳，你是我认识的唯一一个关注脚趾的躯体变形障碍者。”她问：“什么意思？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought of telling her that I was seeing a boy, too, or at least that I'd watched a movie with one, just because I knew it would surprise and amaze her that anyone as disheveled and awkward and stunted as me could even briefly win the affections of a boy.

<div class="line_en">I ended up just picking out some flip-flops so that I could have something to buy, and then I sat down on one of the benches opposite a bank of shoes and watched Kaitlyn snake her way through the aisles, shopping with the kind of intensity and focus that one usually associates with professional chess. I kind of wanted to take out Midnight Dawns and read for a while, but I knew that'd be rude, so I just watched Kaitlyn. Occasionally she'd circle back to me clutching some closed-toe prey and say, "This?" and I would try to make an intelligent comment about the shoe, and then finally she bought three pairs and I bought my flip-flops and then as we exited she said, "Anthropologie?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后我只挑了双人字拖，也是为了不空手而归。然后我在这个美鞋宝库对面的长凳上坐下来，看着凯特琳在货架之间迤逦而行，她购物时的那股子激情和专注一般只有在参加国际象棋职业赛的选手身上才能看到。我有点儿想拿出《午夜的黎明》看一会儿，但我知道那么做太不礼貌，所以就坐在那儿看凯特琳。她时不时会拎一双不露趾的猎物晃回到我身边，说：“怎么样？”我则设法发表两句高明的评论，最后她买了三双鞋，我买了挑中的人字拖。我们出来的时候她说：“去‘人类学’店逛逛？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh. Oh," she said. "Do you like these?" She held up a pair of cute but unspectacular Mary Janes, and I nodded, and she found her size and tried them on, pacing up and down the aisle, watching her feet in the knee-high angled mirrors. Then she grabbed a pair of strappy hooker shoes and said, "Is it even possible to walk in these? I mean, I would just die --" and then stopped short, looking at me as if to say I'm sorry, as if it were a crime to mention death to the dying. "You should try them on," Kaitlyn continued, trying to paper over the awkwardness.</div>

<div class="line_en">So I excused myself on the grounds of pain and fatigue, as I often had over the years when seeing Kaitlyn or any of my other friends. In truth, it always hurt. It always hurt not to breathe like a normal person, incessantly reminding your lungs to be lungs, forcing yourself to accept as unsolvable the clawing scraping inside-out ache of underoxygenation.

<div class="line_en">I liked my mom, but her perpetual nearness sometimes made me feel weirdly nervous. And I liked Kaitlyn, too. I really did. But three years removed from proper full-time schoolic exposure to my peers, I felt a certain unbridgeable distance between us.

<div class="line_cn" title="看《午夜的黎明》到离结尾还有二十页的时候，梅翰的前景似乎大大不妙，他为了从敌人手里营救一个人质（金发碧眼、美国美人）中了十七枪。但作为读者，我一点儿也不绝望。有他没他，战争都会继续；故事能有续集，也一定会有：他的同伙会继续担起主角的重任，特派专员曼尼·洛克，列兵贾斯帕·杰克斯，还有别人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found a bench surrounded by an Irish Gifts store, the Fountain Pen Emporium, and a baseball-cap outlet -- a corner of the mall even Kaitlyn would never shop, and started reading Midnight Dawns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在一家叫作“自来水笔集”的爱尔兰礼品店附近找到一张长椅，旁边还有一家卖棒球帽的小店，这个角落就连凯特琳也不会来逛。我坐下来，看起了《午夜的黎明》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It featured a sentence-to-corpse ratio of nearly 1:1, and I tore through it without ever looking up. I liked Staff Sergeant Max Mayhem, even though he didn't have much in the way of a technical personality, but mostly I liked that his adventures kept happening. There were always more bad guys to kill and more good guys to save. New wars started even before the old ones were won. I hadn't read a real series like that since I was a kid, and it was exciting to live again in an infinite fiction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这本书的特色是句子数目和尸体比例达到了一比一。我头也不抬地一路读下去。我喜欢麦克斯·梅翰上士，尽管他没有什么严格意义上能称之为个性的东西，但我最喜欢的是他的冒险永无止境。总是有更多的坏蛋要杀，更多的好人要救；旧的战争还没结束，新的战争已经开始。从小时候开始，我还没看过任何一套像这样的故事，能在一部无尽的小说里从头再活一次，真是激动人心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other thing about Kaitlyn, I guess, was that it could never again feel natural to talk to her. Any attempts to feign normal social interactions were just depressing because it was so glaringly obvious that everyone I spoke to for the rest of my life would feel awkward and self-conscious around me, except maybe kids like Jackie who just didn't know any better.</div>
