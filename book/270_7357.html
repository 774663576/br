If not for the Volturi, the rest of us would be quickly exposed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脑海中想象的情景，“猎食”这个词令我不寒而栗，但是贾斯帕不担心吓到我，不会像爱德华那样总是对我呵护备至。他一刻不停地继续讲道：“并不是南方的吸血鬼团体多么在乎人类注意到与否。是沃尔图里家族制约着他们，他们是南方团体唯一惧怕的势力。要是没有沃尔图里家族，我们其余人会很快暴露自己的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Because it has been war in the South, constant war for centuries, with never one moment of truce. The covens there barely note the existence of humans, except as soldiers notice a herd of cows by the wayside -- food for the taking. They only hide from the notice of the herd because of the Volturi."</div>

Two nights later, he took on the much stronger clan of allies that claimed Monterrey in northern Mexico. Again, he won."</div>

Very young vampires are volatile, wild, and almost impossible to control. One newborn can be reasoned with, taught to restrain himself, but ten, fifteen together are a nightmare. They'll turn on each other as easily as on the enemy you point them at. Benito had to keep making more as they fought amongst themselves, and as the covens he decimated took more than half his force down before they lost.</div>

I would have thought it would take him much longer to give up on that plan -- he wanted it too much. But there was also the thought of you, Carlisle, of our family, growing stronger and larger. The jealousy and the fear: you having… not more than he had, but still, things that he wanted. He tried not to think about it, but he couldn't hide it completely. The idea of rooting out the competition was there; besides their own, ours is the largest coven they've ever found…"</div>
