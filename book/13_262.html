<div class="line_en">But it was no orc-chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon Gondor. The darkness was breaking too soon, before the date that his Master had set for it: fortune had betrayed him for the moment, and the world had turned against him; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched out his hand to seize it. But his arm was long. He was still in command, wielding great powers. King, Ringwraith, Lord of the Nazgûl, he had many weapons. He left the Gate and vanished.</div>

<div class="line_en">Théoden King of the Mark had reached the road from the Gate to the River, and he turned towards the City that was now less than a mile distant. He slackened his speed a little, seeking new foes, and his knights came about him, and Dernhelm was with them. Ahead nearer the walls Elfhelm's men were among the siege-engines, hewing, slaying, driving their foes into the fire-pits. Well nigh all the northern half of the Pelennor was overrun, and there camps were blazing, orcs were flying towards the River like herds before the hunters; and the Rohirrim went hither and thither at their will. But they had not yet overthrown the siege, nor won the Gate. Many foes stood before it, and on the further half of the plain were other hosts still unfought. Southward beyond the road lay the main force of the Haradrim, and there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain. And he looked out, and in the growing light he saw the banner of the king, and that it was far ahead of the battle with few men about it. Then he was filled with a red wrath and shouted aloud, and displaying his standard, black serpent upon scarlet, he came against the white horse and the green with great press of men; and the drawing of the scimitars of the Southrons was like a glitter of stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骠骑王希优顿，终于赶到了从大河通往正门的道路上。他掉转马头，朝向一哩之外的主城冲去。他让座骑的速度减缓一些，开始寻找妥队的敌人。他麾下的骑士将他包围在正中心，德海姆也挤在护卫的行列中。在靠近城墙的地方，艾海姆的部属全都在疯狂地砍杀，将那些攻城的装置彻底破坏，把原先意气风发的攻城部队驱赶入燃烧着烈焰的壕沟中。在几个小时内，大半的帕兰诺平原就被收复了，敌人的营帐陷入火海，半兽人像是被驱赶的猎物一般四处奔逃，想要跑回河边。洛汗的骠骑如入无人之境地斩杀敌兵，但他们并没有完全击溃敌方的攻势，也还没有夺回正门，许多敌人依旧占据着门前的区域，平原的另外一边，还是挤满了未受一丁点损伤的敌军。在道路的南方是哈拉德林人的主力部队，他们的骑兵集结在酋长的旗帜下，他仔细一看，在晨光中发现了骠骑王的家徽；希优顿那时距离主战场有一段距离，身边的护卫也十分薄弱。于是，哈拉德林的领袖爆吼一声，展开那面在腥红大地上飞舞着一只黑蛇的旗帜，并且立刻率领鏡锐的战士，冲向白马和绿地的王旗所在处。南方人拔出弯刀的景象，让战场上充满了如星辰般的刀光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="正当骠骑王志得意满的时候，晨光却开始黯淡下来，天空微弱的光线再度被遮蔽，黑暗笼罩大地。马匹惊慌失措，人们从马背上被抛下来，哀号着摔落地面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"To me! To me!" cried Théoden. "Up Eorlingas! Fear no darkness!" But Snowmane wild with terror stood up on high, fighting with the air, and then with a great scream he crashed upon his side: a black dart had pierced him. The king fell beneath him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Théoden was aware of him, and would not wait for his onset, but crying to Snowmane he charged headlong to greet him. Great was the clash of their meeting. But the white fury of the Northmen burned the hotter, and more skilled was their knighthood with long spears and bitter. Fewer were they but they clove through the Southrons like a fire-bolt in a forest. Right through the press drove Théoden Thengel's son, and his spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain. Out swept his sword, and he spurred to the standard, hewed staff and bearer; and the black serpent foundered. Then all that was left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希优顿这才发现到他。骠骑王可不是坐以待毙的简单货銫，他立刻大吼一声，命令雪鬃冲向前。两边的部队以雷霆万钧的气势互相冲撞，不过，北方战士的怒火更炽烈，而他们的马术和枪术也胜过南方人许多。虽然敌众我寡，但骠骑们像是无人能阻的雷电一样，在敌阵中来去自如。希优顿擎着长枪刺进敌将的身体，在长枪落地前，他手上的宝剑就将敌方的战旗和军官连旗带人砍成两半，黑銫的大蛇落到地面。敌方的骑兵一见状况不对，立刻转身就跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The great shadow descended like a falling cloud. And behold! it was a winged creature: if bird, then greater than all other birds, and it was naked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older world maybe it was, whose kind, lingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath the Moon, outstayed their day, and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark Lord took it, and nursed it with fell meats, until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly; and he gave it to his servant to be his steed. Down, down it came, and then, folding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body of Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck.</div>

A crown of steel he bore, but between rim and robe naught was there to see, save only a deadly gleam of eyes: the Lord of the Nazgûl.

<div class="line_en">But Théoden was not utterly forsaken. The knights of his house lay slain about him, or else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne far away. Yet one stood there still: Dernhelm the young, faithful beyond fear; and he wept, for he had loved his lord as a father. Right through the charge Merry had been borne unharmed behind him, until the Shadow came; and then Windfola had thrown them in his terror, and now ran wild upon the plain. Merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast, and such a horror was on him that he was blind and sick.</div>

<div class="line_en">The winged creature screamed at her, but the Ringwraith made no answer, and was silent, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement for a moment conquered Merry's fear. He opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them. There some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, and above it loomed the Nazgûl Lord like a shadow of despair. A little to the left facing them stood she whom he had called Dernhelm. But the helm of her secrecy had fallen from her, and her bright hair, released from its bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders. Her eyes grey as the sea were hard and fell, and yet tears were on her cheek. A sword was in her hand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy's eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妖兽对她嘶吼，但戒灵却迟疑了，沉默地没有做出任何回应。梅里对于这现况的惊讶盖过了恐惧，他张开眼，发现自己又看得见了。妖兽就在距离他只有几步的地方，戒灵之王的身影像是纯粹绝望的集合体一般骑在它之上。在它左边不远的地方则是自称为德海姆的伊欧玟。她除下了隐藏身分用的头盔，金銫的秀发随风飞扬，她灰銫的双眸毫不退让地看着前方，脸颊上挂着之前的泪水。她手中握着宝剑，另一只手则是举起盾牌，遮挡敌人可能的攻击。">查看中文翻译</div>

For into Merry's mind flashed the memory of the face that he saw at the riding from Dunharrow: the face of one that goes seeking death, having no hope. Pity filled his heart and great wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke. He clenched his hand. She should not die, so fair, so desperate! At least she should not die alone, unaided.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur's heir, out of the Paths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the kingdom of Gondor; and the mirth of the Rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords, and the joy and wonder of the City was a music of trumpets and a ringing of bells. But the hosts of Mordor were seized with bewilderment, and a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled with their foes; and a black dread fell on them, knowing that the tides of fate had turned against them and their doom was at hand.</div>

Yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and never was a meeting of friends more joyful." And they clasped hand in hand. "Nor indeed more timely," said Éomer. "You come none too soon, my friend. Much loss and sorrow has befallen us."</div>

<div class="line_en">East rode the knights of Dol Amroth driving the enemy before them: troll-men and Variags and orcs that hated the sunlight. South strode Éomer and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and swept north like a storm. There came Legolas, and Gimli wielding his axe, and Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan and Elrohir with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed Dúnedain, Rangers of the North, leading a great valour of the folk of Lebennin and Lamedon and the fiefs of the South. But before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, Andúril like a new fire kindled, Narsil re-forged as deadly as of old; and upon his brow was the Star of Elendil.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the Sun went at last behind Mindolluin and filled all the sky with a great burning, so that the hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood; fire glowed in the River, and the grass of the Pelennor lay red in the nightfall. And in that hour the great Battle of the field of Gondor was over; and not one living foe was left within the circuit of the Rammas. All were slain save those who fled to die, or to drown in the red foam of the River. Few ever came eastward to Morgul or Mordor; and to the land of the Haradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of the wrath and terror of Gondor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aragorn and Éomer and Imrahil rode back towards the Gate of the City, and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow. These three were unscathed, for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their wrath. But many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field. The axes hewed Forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed; and both Duilin of Morthond and his brother were trampled to death when they assailed the mûmakil, leading their bowmen close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters. Neither Hirluin the fair would return to Pinnath Gelin, nor Grimbold to Grimslade, nor Halbarad to the Northlands, dour-handed Ranger. No few had fallen, renowned or nameless, captain or soldier; for it was a great battle and the full count of it no tale has told.
