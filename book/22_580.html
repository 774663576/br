<div class="line_en">It was only two weeks and yet, the hours at Briar were such slow ones, and the days -- being all quite the same -- were so even and quiet and long, it might have been twice that time. It was long enough, anyway, for me to find out all the peculiar habits of the house; long enough for me to get used to the other servants, and for them to get used to me. For a while, I didn't know why it was they did not care for me. I would go down to the kitchen, saying, "How do you do?" to whoever I met there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然只有短短两周，可在布莱尔的每分每秒都过得那么慢，每天——千篇一律的——都如此平静，安闲，漫长，时间好象翻了一倍。无论如何，这日子漫长得足以让我了解这宅子里所有的奇怪规矩，足以让我习惯其他仆人，也让他们习惯我。曾经一度，我不明白他们为什么不喜欢我。我走到楼下厨房里，不管在那儿遇到谁，我都会说句：“你好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I supposed they were peeved to have me about, reminding them of all the flash London things they would never, in that quiet and out-of-the-way place, get a look at. Then one day Mrs Stiles took me aside. She said, "I hope you don't mind, Miss Smith, if I have a little word? I can't say how the house was run in your last place --" She started everything she said to me with a line like that.-- "I can't say how you did things in London, but here at Briar we like to keep very mindful of the footings of the house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得是我的存在令他们恼火，我会使他们想起，身处于这么个宁静而落伍的地方，他们永远也见不到伦敦那光鲜的一切。然后有天，斯黛尔太太把我拉到一旁，她说道：“希望你别介意，史密斯小姐，我有几句话要说。我不清楚你前一位主人家里是怎么打理的——”她跟我说什么话都以这句开头。“——我不清楚你在伦敦当女仆都做些什么，不过在这儿，在布莱尔，我们对彼此关系的处理都非常小心…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, I saw that, if I was to get anywhere with them, I must watch my steps. I gave Charles a bit of chocolate, that I had carried down with me from the Borough and never eaten; I gave Margaret a piece of scented soap; and to Mrs Cakebread I gave a pair of those black stockings that Gentleman had had Phil get for me from the crooked warehouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，我明白了，如果我要跟他们相处下去，就得注意言行。我给了查尔斯一点巧克力，那是我从镇子上带来没舍得吃的，给了玛格丽特一块香皂，至于凯克布莱德太太，绅士让菲尔从销赃仓库帮我搞的那些黑色丝袜，我给了她一双。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I said I hoped there were no hard feelings. If I met Charles on the stairs in the morning, then, I looked the other way. They were all much nicer to me after that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说我希望这样不会令人太难堪。如果早晨在楼梯上碰到查尔斯，我眼睛就望向别处。这之后，他们都对我友善多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's like a servant. A servant says, "All for my master," and means, "All for myself." It's the two-facedness of it that I can't bear. At Briar, they were all on the dodge in one way or another, but all over sneaking little matters that would have put a real thief to the blush -- such as, holding off the fat from Mr Lilly's gravy to sell on the quiet to the butcher's boy; which is what Mrs Cakebread did. Or, pulling the pearl buttons from Maud's chemises, and keeping them, and saying they were lost; which is what Margaret did. I had them all worked out, after three days' watching. I might have been Mrs Sucksby's own daughter after all. Mr Way, now: he had a mark on the side of his nose -- in the Borough we should have called it a gin-bud. And how do you think he got that, in a place like his? He had the key to Mr Lilly's cellar, on a chain. You never saw such a shine as that key had on it! And then, when we had finished our meals in Mrs Stiles's pantry, he would make a great show of loading up the tray -- and I'd see him, when he thought no-one was looking, tipping the beer from the bottom of all the glasses into one great cup, and lushing it away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那样才象个仆人。一个仆人说，“一切为了我的主人，”意思也是说“一切为了我自己”。这是这句话的两个含义，而我不能容忍这这个。在布莱尔，他们都会以这样或那样的方式揩油，而他们偷偷摸摸耍的那些小伎俩会让一个货真价实的扒手羞红了脸——比如说，把该给李先生煮肉汤里肉，悄悄拿去卖给屠户家小厮，这是凯克布莱德太太干的；或者，把莫德内衣上的珍珠纽扣摘下来，藏起来，说扣子丢了，这是玛格丽特干的。现在说魏先生：他鼻子上有块红斑——在蓝特街我们称之为酒糟鼻，你觉得他为什么会长斑呢？他有一把李先生酒窖的钥匙，拴在钥匙链上，你都没见过哪把钥匙会那样闪闪发光！当时呢，我们在斯黛尔太太的餐室里吃完饭，他会装模做样地收拾盘子——而我见过，他还以为没人看见，他把所有酒瓶底的酒倒进一个大杯子里，然后一饮而尽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It turned out that Mrs Cakebread had fancied herself insulted, by my saying good-morning to the kitchen-maid and the knife-boy before I said it to her; and Charles thought I meant to tease him, by wishing him good-morning at all. It was all the most trifling sort of nonsense, and enough to make a cat laugh; but it was life and death to them -- I suppose, it would be life and death to you, if all you had to look forward to for the next forty years was carrying trays and baking pastry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这说明凯克布莱德太太认为，我先跟厨娘和打杂的男孩说“早上好”，再跟她打招呼，对她来说是一种侮辱。而查尔斯以为我祝他“早上好”，根本就是想嘲弄他。这都是些最无关紧要的闲言碎语，够让一只猫哈哈大笑了；可对他们来说，这是生死攸关的大事——我想，如果你不得不指望靠端盘子、烤蛋糕度过四十年余生，这对你也会是生死攸关的大事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw it -- but, of course, I kept it all to myself. I wasn't there to make trouble. It was nothing to me, if he drank himself to death. And I passed most of my time, anyway, with Maud. I got used to her, too. She had her finicking ways, all right; but they were slight enough, it didn't hurt me to indulge them. And I was good at working hard, on little things: I began to take a kind of pleasure in the keeping of her gowns, the tidying of her pins and combs and boxes. I was used to dressing infants. I grew used to dressing her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我都看到了——不过，当然，我就让自己知道。我来这儿不是惹麻烦的。即便他酗酒醉死，也与我无关。反正我大部分时间是和莫德一起消磨。我也渐渐习惯她了。她确实有她挑剔的地方，不过这都微不足道，并不妨碍我接纳她的挑剔。而且我擅长收拾家务，从帮她收拾裙子，帮她整理别针、发卡、梳子和盒子时，我开始体会到某种乐趣。我以前习惯帮婴儿穿衣服，现在慢慢习惯帮她穿衣服了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So then she did send soup. Maud ate it all up. "Why are you smiling?" she said, in her anxious way, when she had finished. I said I wasn't. She put down her spoon. Then she frowned, like before, over her gloves. They had got splashed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她就送汤上来。莫德把汤喝得精光了，“你为什么笑？”她吃完，以她特有的紧张问道，我说我没笑。她放下汤匙，又皱起眉，跟以前一样，为她的手套。手套上沾了汤汁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's only water," I said, seeing her face. "It won't hurt you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那只是水，”我看着她的脸，说道。“不会让你觉得难受的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When her fingernails grew long I cut them, with a pair of silver scissors she had, that were shaped like a flying bird. Her nails were soft and perfectly clean, and grew quickly, like a child's nails. When I cut, she flinched. The skin of her hands was smooth -- but, like the rest of her, too smooth to be right, I never saw it without thinking of the things -- rough things, sharp things -- that would mark or hurt it. I was glad when she put her gloves back on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果她指甲长了，我就用她的一把银剪刀帮她剪指甲，那剪刀形状象只飞鸟。她指甲很软，非常干净，长的也快，有点象小孩指甲。我剪的时候，她有些畏惧。她手上肌肤很光洁——不过，象她身上肌肤一样，光洁的不正常。每次看到，我都会联想到一些东西——粗糙的，或尖利的——会在她身上留下印记或伤害的东西。看她把手套戴起来，我会觉得很安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She bit her lip. She sat another minute with her hands in her lap, stealing glances at her fingers, growing more and more restless. Finally she said: "I think the water has a little fat in it…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她咬着嘴唇，手放在腿上坐了片刻，偷眼看着她的手指，越来越不安了。最后她说道：“我觉得汤里有点油…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, it was easier to go into her room and get her a fresh pair of gloves myself, than to sit and watch her fret. "Let me do it," I said, undoing the button at her wrist; and though at first she wouldn't let me touch her bare hands, in time -- since I said I would be gentle -- she began to let me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好，与其坐那儿眼睁睁看她着急，还不如到她卧室里帮她拿双干净手套，“让我来，”我边说，边帮她解开手腕上的钮儿。尽管起初她不让我碰她脱了手套的手，但很快——因为我说我会很小心——她就不介意了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Do you see how it struggles? It wants to flow, but the cold will still it. Do you see, Sue? Here, among the rushes?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地上土质松软，踩在鞋底，她说道：“小草多脆弱啊！我想河水会结冰的，我想河水已经结冰了，你看到河水在挣扎吗？它想流过去，可是寒冷不让它流。你看到了吗？苏？这里，芦苇中间的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我挽起她的胳膊。我想也没想就这么做了；她胳膊还有点僵硬。不过后来，第二天——还是第三天——她又挽起我的胳膊，她自己也没那么僵硬了，这之后，我觉得我俩自然而然地就手挽手了…我也说不清。">查看中文翻译</div>

One day I was tidying one of her drawers and found a deck of cards in it. She said she thought they must have been her mother's. She knew the suits, but that was all -- she called the jacks, cavaliers! -- so I taught her one or two soft Borough games -- All-fours, and Put. We played for matches and spills, at first; then we found, in another drawer, a box of little counters, made of mother-of-pearl and shaped like fish and diamonds and crescent moons; and after that, we played for them. The mother-of-pearl was very sweet and cool on the hand.-- My hand, I mean; for Maud of course still wore her gloves. And when she put down a card she put it down neatly, making the edges and corners match with the ones below. After a while I began to do that, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first I would say to myself, "When Gentleman comes I'll do this'; or, "Once he gets her in the madhouse, I'll do that." But I'd say it, then look at her; and she was so simple and so good, the thought would vanish, I would end up combing her hair or straightening the sash on her gown. It wasn't that I was sorry -- or not much, not then. It was just I suppose that we were put together for so many hours at a time; and it was nicer to be kind to her and not think too hard about what lay before her, than to dwell on it and feel cruel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, it was different for her. She was looking forwards. She liked to talk; but more often she liked to be silent, and think. I would see her face change, then. I would lie at her side at night, and feel the turning, turning of her thoughts -- feel her grow warm, perhaps blush in the dark; and then I knew she was thinking of Gentleman, working out how soon he'd come, wondering if he was thinking of her.-- I could have told her, he was. But she never spoke of him, she never said his name. She only asked, once or twice, after my old aunty, that was supposed to be his nurse; and I wished she wouldn't, for when I spoke of her I thought of Mrs Sucksby; and that made me home-sick.</div>

She looked at me, then opened her mouth again and I put the thimble on my finger and rubbed at the pointed tooth until the point was taken off. I had seen Mrs Sucksby do it many times, with infants. -- Of course, infants rather wriggle about. Maud stood very still, her pink lips parted, her face put back, her eyes at first closed then open and gazing at me, her cheek with a flush upon it. Her throat lifted and sank, as she swallowed. My hand grew wet, from the damp of her breaths. I rubbed, then felt with my thumb. She swallowed again. Her eyelids fluttered, and she caught my eye. And, as she did, there came a knock upon the door; and we both jumped. I stepped away. It was one of the parlourmaids. She had a letter on a tray. "For Miss Maud," she said, with a curtsey. I looked at the hand, and knew at once that it must be Gentleman's. My heart gave a dip. So did Maud's, I think.</div>

He was as mad over his pictures as he was over his books, and had fitted up a little room for Gentleman to work in, darker and closer even than his library. I suppose the pictures were old and pretty precious. I never saw them. Nobody did. Mr Lilly and Gentleman carried keys about with them, and they locked the door to that room whether they were out of it or in it. They worked until one o'clock, then took their lunch.

Now, of course, she walked with Gentleman: he would offer her his arm and, after a show of hesitation, she would take it; I think she held it more easily, through having grown used to holding mine. She walked pretty stiffly, though; but then, he would find little artful ways to pull her closer. He would bend his head until it was near hers. He would pretend to brush dust from her collar. There would start off space between them, but steadily the space would close -- at last, there would only be the rub of his sleeve upon hers, the buckling of her skirt about his trousers. I saw it all; for I walked behind them. I carried her satchel of paints and brushes, her wooden triangle, and a stool. Sometimes they would draw away from me, and seem quite to forget me. Then Maud would remember, and turn, and say, "How good you are, Sue! You do not mind the walk? Mr Rivers thinks another quarter of a mile will do it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她的椅子在那儿，那副差劲的画也在，她的画笔——一支笔掉在地上——和颜料都在。我走过去捡起地上的笔。我觉得应该是绅士，他拥着她回了屋子，丢下热得冒汗的我，丢下了所有东西。可我想象不出，她会一个人乖乖地跟他走。我几乎为她担心起来。我象个真的女仆一样，为女主人着急起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then I slept. I slept and dreamt of Lant Street -- I dreamt of Mr Ibbs at his brazier, burning his hand and shouting. The shout woke me up. I started from the punt, not knowing for a second where I was. Then I looked about me. Maud and Gentleman were nowhere to be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，我就睡着了。我睡着了，还梦到蓝特街——我梦见艾伯斯先生在他的火盆边烤手，咭里哇啦地嚷嚷着。他的叽里哇啦吵醒了我。我从小船上站起来，有一秒钟没回过神来，不知身在何处。然后我看看周围，哪儿都没看到莫德和绅士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then I heard her voice, murmuring. I walked a little way, and saw them. They had not gone far -- only just along the river, where it bent about the wall. They did not hear me come, they did not look round. They must have walked together along the line of rushes; and then I suppose he had spoken to her at last. He had spoken, for the first time, without me to overhear him -- and I wondered what words he had said, that could make her lean against him, like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后我听到她的说话声，她在窃窃私语。我循声走了一小段路，就看到他们了。他们并没有走远——只是在河岸拐弯靠着围墙的地方。他们没听到我过来，也没看这边。他们肯定是沿着芦苇一起走过来的；最后，我估计他在跟她说话。这是第一次，他在没有我旁听的情况下，跟她讲话——他讲了些什么话，能让她象这样贴在他怀里，我很好奇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had her head upon his collar. Her skirt rose at the back, almost to her knees. And yet, her face she kept turned hard from his. Her arms hung at her side, like a doll's arms. He moved his mouth against her hair, and whispered. Then, while I stood watching, he lifted one of her weak hands and slowly drew the glove half from it; and then he kissed her naked palm. And by that, I knew he had her. I think he sighed. I think she sighed, too -- I saw her sag still closer to him, then give a shiver. Her skirt rose even higher, and showed the tops of her stockings, the white of her thigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她头靠在他衣领上，裙子后面翘起来，几乎看得到她的膝盖。但是，她努力地把脸从他的脸旁边别过来，她胳膊吊在他身上，象洋娃娃的胳膊。他嘴唇移到她头发上，轻轻说着什么。接着，就在我偷看的时候，他拉起她一只柔弱的手，慢慢地把手套褪到一半，然后，吻上了毫无保留的手心。到那会儿，我知道他已经征服她了。我想他会松一口气的。我想她也会松一口气的——我看到她身子软下来，依旧贴着他，然后颤抖了一下。她裙子翘得更高了，露出她长袜袜口，还有白色大腿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The air was thick as treacle. My gown was damp where it gripped. A limb of iron would have sweated, in a dress on such a day. An eye of marble would have swivelled in its socket to gaze as I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气象蜜糖一样浓稠。我衣服贴身的地方都汗湿了。这种天气里，哪怕是一支铁棍，裹上一件衣裳也会出汗。大理石雕像的眼睛也会象我的眼睛一样，在眼窝里滴溜溜乱转。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I should have been glad to see him do it. I was not. Instead, I imagined the rub of his whiskers upon her palm. I thought of her smooth white fingers, her soft white nails. -- I had cut them, that morning. I had dressed her and brushed her hair. I had been keeping her, neat and in her looks -- all for the sake of this moment. All for him. Now, against the dark of his jacket and hair, she seemed so neat -- so slight, so pale -- I thought she might break. I thought he might swallow her up, or bruise her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到他做这些，我应该开心的。可我并不开心。取而代之的是，我想象着他胡子摩擦着她的手心，我想到她光洁白嫩的手指，柔软细白的指甲。——那天早上我给她剪过指甲。我给她穿衣裳，给她梳头。我守护着她，把她的样貌收拾得优雅时尚——都是为了这个时刻。都是为了他。现在，靠在他黑色外套和头发上，她看起来那么整洁——那么渺小，那么苍白——我觉得她会碎掉。我想他会把她活吞下去，或者把她捏坏了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The purr of the bullfrogs was louder than before. The river lapped like a tongue among the rushes. I watched, and he dipped his head, and softly kissed her again.</div>

<div class="line_en">I said nothing. Maud, too, was silent, and looked nowhere but at her feet. I put her cloak about her, then took the painting and the paints, the stool and the basket, and followed her and Gentleman back, through the gate in the wall, to the house. Mr Way opened the door to us. As he closed it the thunder came again. Then the rain began to fall, in great, dark, staining drops.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没说话。莫德也沉默着，她眼睛哪儿都不看，只盯着自己的脚。我给她披上斗篷，然后收拾起画、颜料、椅子和篮子，跟着她和绅士往回走，穿过围墙上的门，回到了李宅。绅士为我们开门。当他关上大门时，外面又传来一阵雷声。然后天开始下雨，大颗的灰暗雨点倾泄而下，天地一片浑浊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sue! We didn't like to wake you. We have been walking, and lost ourselves in gazing at the river. Now the light is all gone, and we shall have rain, I think. Have you a coat for your mistress?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just in time!" said Gentleman softly, gazing at Maud and letting her draw her hand from him. It was the hand he had kissed. She must have felt his lips there still, for I saw her turn from him and hold it to her bosom, and stroke her fingers over her palm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正逢其时！”绅士轻轻地说道，他盯着莫德，任她抽回自己的手。就是那只他吻过的手。她肯定还沉浸在他的吻里，因为我看到她从他身边转过去，那只手放在心口，指头摩擦着手心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turned away. I felt the heat of the day, the thickness of the air, the rank-ness of the rushes, too hard. I turned, and stole softly back to where the painting was. After a minute there came thunder, and another minute after that I heard the sound of skirts, and then Maud and Gentleman walked quickly about the curving wall, she with her arm in his, her gloves buttoned up and her eyes on the ground; him with his hand upon her fingers, his head bent. When he saw me he gave me a look. He said,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转过身走开。我感觉到天气的躁热，空气的厚重，芦苇的恶臭，这些感觉太强烈了。我转过去，偷偷地，轻手轻脚地回到她画画的地方。一分钟后，空中传来阵阵雷鸣，之后又过了一分钟，我听见裙子的声音，然后莫德和绅士快步沿着蜿蜒的围墙走过来，她挽着他的胳膊，手套扣上了，眼睛看着地面；他握着她的手指，头朝她侧着。">查看中文翻译</div>
