<meta content="嗯，为他从来也没那么做过，让把带两个鸡蛋的早餐送到他床头去吃，自打在市徽饭店就没这么过，那阵子他常在床上装病，嗓音病病囊囊，摆出一副亲王派头，好赢得那个干瘪老太婆赖尔登的欢心，他自以为老太婆会听他摆布呢，可她一个铜板也没给咱留下，全都献给了弥撒，为她自己和她的灵魂，简直是天底下头一号抠门鬼，连为自己喝的那杯掺了木精的酒都怕掏四便士，净对我讲她害的这个病那个病，没完没了地絮叨她那套政治啦，地震啦，世界末日啦，咱们找点儿乐子不好吗，唉要是全世界的女人都像她那样可够呛，把游泳衣和袒胸夜礼服都给骂苦了，当然喽，谁也不会要她去穿这样的衣服，想必正因为没有一个男人会对她多看上一眼，她信教才信得那么虔诚，但愿我永远不会变得像她那样，奇怪的是她倒没要求我们把脸蒙起来，话又说回来啦，她的确是个受过良好教育的女人，她就是唠唠叨叨地三句话不离赖尔登先生，我觉得他摆脱了她才叫高兴哩，还有她那只狗，总嗅我的毛皮衣服，老是往我的衬裙里面钻，尤其是身上来了的时候，不过我还是喜欢他对那样的老太婆有礼貌，无论对端盘子的还是对叫花子，他都是这样，向来也不摆空架子，但也不会老是这个样儿，要是他真有什么严重的毛病，住院要好得多，那儿什么都那么干净，可我想我得催上他一个月他才肯答应，嗯，可医院里又会出现个护士，他会赖着不肯出院，一直到被他们赶了出来，兴许那护士还是个修女呢，就像他身上带着的那张下流相片上的，不过那女的跟我一样才不是什么修女呢，嗯，因为男人们一生病就软弱起来，净说些没出息的话，要是没有个女人照料就好不了，要是他流了鼻血，那可就不得了啦，那回在糖锥山参加合唱团的野餐会，他在离南环路不远的地方扭伤了脚，他脸上那神情活像是快要呜呼哀哉似的，那天我穿的是那件衣服，斯塔克小姐给他送来了花儿，是她在筐底儿上所能找到的最蹩脚的蔫花儿，她死乞白赖非要钻进男人的卧室不可，用她那老姑娘嗓门儿说话，仿佛他都快为她的缘故死啦，那么一来就再也看不到你的脸啦，他躺在床上，胡子长长了一些，更像个男子汉啦，爹也曾是这样的，我就讨厌给缠绷带啦喂药唔的，当他用剃胡刀去割鸡眼大趾出血的时候，我直害怕他会害上败血症，假若害病的是我，倒想瞧瞧能得到什么样的照料，不过当然喽，妇道人家总是隐瞒自己的病情，省得给人添所有那些麻烦，她们就是这样的，嗯，他到什么地方去过从他的食欲来看，这我是有把握的，不管怎样总不会是在搞恋爱，不然的话净想娘儿们就吃不下东西啦，要不就是半夜里在街上拉客的窑姐儿，要是他真到那儿去过那么说什么去了饭店就左不过是他存心蒙骗编出的一套谎话喽，海因斯把我留住啦，我碰见谁来着，啊，嗯，我碰见了门顿，你记得吗，另外还有谁来着，让我想想看，我想起他那张大娃娃脸了，他刚结婚没多久就在普尔万景画会上跟个小妞儿调起情来啦，我就把背掉了过去，他偷偷儿地溜掉啦，看上去怪害臊的，这又碍着什么事儿啦，可有一回竟然冒冒失失地向我讨起好来了，亏他干得出，自以为了不起，大嘴巴肿眼泡儿，是我见过的天底下头号笨蛋，大家还喊他作律师呢，我可不愿意在床上那么长篇大论的，不然的话那就是他在什么地方结交的，要不就是偷偷搞到手的小婊子，要是她们跟我一样了解他的话，嗯，前天我去前屋取火柴并且把报纸上迪格纳穆的讣告拿给他看的时候，他正唰唰唰地写着什么信哪，他用吸墨纸把它盖住，假装在想什么生意上的事，那很可能就是写给某人的，那个女的必定认为他是个冤大头，因为所有的男人到了他这把年纪多少就会变成这样，尤其他现在已经快四十岁啦，所以女的就甜言蜜语尽量骗他的钱，再也没有比老傻瓜更傻的啦，接着又为了遮掩，就像往常那样吻我屁股，他究竟跟谁干着这名堂或是老早就相好了，我一点儿也不在乎，尽管我还是想弄清楚，只要他们俩别总是在我鼻子底下，就像我们在翁塔利奥高台街的时候雇的那个浪娘儿们玛丽似的，为了教他上劲儿，就垫了个假屁股，从他身上闻到了那些搽了脂粉的娘儿们的气味，真恶心有一两回我倒是真起了疑心，把他叫过来的时候发现他外衣上巴着根长头发，可没见那个的影子，我到厨房去一瞧，他正在那儿假装喝水哪，对他们来说只有一个女人是不够的，当然喽全都怪他，把底下人都惯坏啦，你看多奇怪，还提出过可不可以让她在圣诞节的时候跟咱们同桌吃饭哪，哦那可不行，在我家绝不能这样，偷我的土豆，还有二先令六便士一打的牡蛎，去看望她的姑妈，哦，简直是公然抢劫啦，我敢说他跟那个娘儿们有点儿不干不净，这种事儿我总能弄个水落石出，他说拿不出证据来，我抓到了她的证据，哦对，她姑妈特爱吃牡蛎，我把我对她的看法告诉了他，他竟然拐弯抹角想打发我出去，好跟她单独在一起，我才不会降低身份去暗中监视他们哩，星期五她出去的时候我在她房里看到一副袜带，这就太不像话啦，做得过分了点儿，当我限她一星期后卷铺盖，她把脸都气肿了，我看索性不要女仆的好，我自个儿收拾屋子更麻利哩，就是做饭倒垃圾可够讨厌的，反正我告诉了他，要是不辞退她我就离开这个家，只要一想到他曾经跟那么个肮脏无耻满嘴瞎话的邋遢女人在一块儿来着，我就连碰也不肯碰他啦，她当着我的面抵赖，到处唱着歌儿，连在厕所里都唱，因为她晓得自己撞上了好运气，嗯，因为他绝不可能那么久都不搞，他就得到什么地方去搞上一通，最后一回是什么时候从后面跟我搞来着，那天晚上沿着托尔卡河走去的时候博伊兰使劲攥了一下我的手，另一只手悄悄地伸到我手里，我只用大拇指按了按他的手背，回攥了一下，唱着五月的新月喜洋洋，宝贝，因为他对他和我的关系有看法，他才不是那么个傻瓜呢，他说什么在外面吃饭啦，到欢乐剧场去啦，反正我不让他得到满足，不管怎样，与其什么时候都老是戴同一顶旧帽子，他确实使我换了换口味，除非我花钱雇个漂亮小伙子来搞，我自己搞不了嘛，男孩子会喜欢我的，跟他单独在一起的时候，我会叫他神魂颠倒，我让他看看我的袜带，那副崭新的，把他弄得满脸通红，拿眼睛盯着他，勾引他，我晓得脸蛋儿上长出又细又软的短须的那些男孩儿怎样想，他们净整个钟头地把那物儿拽出来自己解闷儿啦，然后就一问一答，你会跟那个送煤的干这档子那档子和另外一档子事吗，对啦，跟一位主教呢，对啦，我会干的，我告诉他当我在犹太教堂的院子里正编织毛衣的时候，一位教长要么是个主教就坐在我身边那人对都柏林不熟悉，净问啥纪念碑啦，那是啥地方啦，一提起那些雕像我就腻味透啦，一鼓励他，他就更不像话啦，竟问起我，眼下你心上有谁呀，你想着谁哪是谁呀，把他的名字告诉我吧，是谁呀，告诉我，是谁呀，德国皇上吗，嗯，那么你就把我当作那位皇上好啦，思念他吧，你能感觉得到他吗，哦，居然想让我当婊子，他永远也做不到，如今他都到这把年纪了，应该收摊儿啦，他给任何女人带来的都只能是毁灭，一点儿也得不到满足，还得装出一副喜欢的样子，直到他丢了精，我也只好自己了结，弄得连嘴唇都苍白了，不管怎样如今一了百了，世人成天谈论这种事儿，其实只有头一回才算个数，以后就成了家常便饭啦，连想都不去想它，为什么非得先嫁给一个男人才许跟他接吻呢，有时候你爱得发狂，觉得非那么着不可，浑身发酥，简直不由自主啦，我巴不得迟早有那么一天旁边有个男人搂住我亲嘴，什么也比不上个长长的热吻，麻酥酥的，一直热到你的魂儿里，我讨厌做忏悔，那阵子我常到科里根神父那儿去忏悔，他摸了摸我，神父，那么他对你造成什么损害了吗，在哪儿，我像个傻子似的说，在运河堤岸上，但是我的孩子，在你身上哪一带，是腿后边高处吗，对吗，嗯，挺高的，就是你用来坐的那个部位，嗯哦老天爷，难道他就不能干脆说声屁股，不就结了吗，这跟那有什么关系，那么你有没有，我忘记他是怎么说的了，没有，神父，而且我总是想到真正的父亲，他想知道什么呢，因为当我向天主忏悔完了之后，他有着一双肥肥胖胖挺好看的手手心总是发湿，摸摸这只手我倒也不在意，他也未尝不是这样，我望着套在他那公牛脖子上的白圈圈就琢磨，我倒想知道他认没认出待在忏悔阁子里的我，我看得见他的脸，当然喽我的脸他是瞧不见的，他也绝没有朝这边望，连点儿苗头都没有，尽管这样可当他父亲死的时候他两眼都红了，当然喽，他们对女人已经死了心当一个男人哭鼻子的时候该是挺可怕的事，他们就更不必说啦，我倒是巴不得让这些穿法衣的人当中的一个抱一阵，他身上散发着教皇那样的馨香，而且你要是个有夫之妇，跟教士在一起就更没有危险啦，他对自己再小心不过啦，然后再献上点儿什么给教皇大人来赎罪，我倒想知道他对我满不满足，他临走的时候在门厅里熟头熟脑地朝我屁股拍了一巴掌，我讨厌他这下子，不过我只是笑了笑，我可不是一匹马或一头驴啊，我不是吧，我猜想当时他正怀念他的祖先来着，我倒想知道这会子他是不是在醒着，正想念着我，或正在做梦，他梦里有我吗，那花儿是谁送给他的呢，他说是买的，他身上有股酒味儿，不是威士忌，也不是黑啤酒，也许是贴传单的时候用的那种甜丝丝糨糊气味的酒哩，我倒想啜上一口，看上去像是挺有滋味的名贵的绿黄色酒，是专门给那些戴歌剧帽在后台口出出进进的公子哥儿喝的，有一回那个带着一只松鼠的美国人跟爹谈邮票生意，我用手指头蘸着尝了尝，最后干的那回，他使劲挣扎着才没有睡着，我们刚喝完葡萄酒，吃罢肉罐头，那肉咸咸的挺有滋味，嗯，因为我觉得又快活又疲倦，刚一躺到床上就沉沉地睡熟啦，直到打雷才把我吵醒，天主饶恕我们吧，我以为会遭到天罚哩，就画了个十字，念了一遍圣母经，那雷就跟直布罗陀的一样可怕，仿佛世界末日到来了似的，然后他们又来告诉你天主并不存在，可像那样哗哗地奔流，你能怎么办呢，一点儿办法也没有，只好悔罪呗，那天傍晚我在白修士街教堂为五月点了支蜡烛它带来了好运，不过他要是听说了，他准会嘲笑的，因为他向来不进教堂去望弥撒或参加早课晚课，他说，你的灵魂，你没有灵魂，里面只有脑灰质，因为他不晓得拥有灵魂是怎么回事，对啦，我点上灯，因为他那红兽般的巨大玩意儿足足丢了三四回，我担心那上头的血管，或随便怎么叫吧，会胀破的，尽管他的鼻子倒并不怎么大，我曾花好半天工夫去梳妆打扮喷洒香水，然后把百叶窗撂下，并脱得赤条条的，那玩意儿像根铁棍，要不就是粗铁撬，直直地那么竖着，他想必是吃了牡蛎，一定吃了好几打，他那大嗓门儿就像唱歌一样，不，我一辈子也没觉出任何人有那么大的阳物，使你感到填得满满的，事后他准吃掉了一整只羊，干吗在咱们身子中间开那么个大洞，像匹种马似的猛冲进来，因为这就是他们在你身上所要的一切，他的眼神儿是那么不顾一切，那么凶狠，我只好眯起眼睛，他那玩意儿可从来没这么雄壮过，于是我让他把那玩意儿拽出来，在我肚子上抽，想到它那么大这样就好多了，以防止没彻底地冲洗干净，最后一次我让他丢在我里面了，这是在女人身上做的一个多么好的发明，好让男人尽情地快活一场，可要是什么人哪怕让他尝到一点点个中滋味，他们就会明白我为了生米莉受过多大罪啦，谁都不会相信还有她刚长牙那阵子，还有米娜普里福伊的丈夫，摇摆着那副络腮胡子，每年往她身子里填进一个娃娃或一对双胞胎，跟钟表一样地准，她身上总是发出一股娃娃气味，他们给一个娃娃起名叫布杰斯什么的，那模样儿活脱儿像黑人，头发乱蓬蓬的耶稣小家伙，娃娃黑黝黝，上回我到那儿去，只见足足有一小队娃娃们，都在争先恐后，大喊大叫，你连自己的耳朵都听不见啦，想来都很健康，男人们非把女人弄得像大象那么浑身胀鼓鼓的才心满意足，可也难说，我要是冒一次险怀上个不是他的娃娃会怎么样呢，不过假若他结了婚，我相信准能养下个漂亮结实的娃娃可也难说，波尔迪的劲头来得更足呢，嗯，那样一来该多么有趣啊，我猜想他是因为碰见了乔西鲍威尔，还有那档子葬礼，又记起我跟博伊兰的事儿，所以就兴奋起来了，喏，随便他怎么去想吧，只要他称心就好，我知道当我出现的时候他们两个已经有点儿勾勾搭搭啦，乔治娜辛普森举行新屋落成宴的那个晚上，他跟她跳舞，还一块儿坐在外面，他千方百计让我相信那是由于不忍心看到她被冷落，坐在一边当墙花，我们为了政治问题大吵一通，是他开的头，可不是我，他说咱们的天主是个木匠，最后他把我弄哭了，女人对什么事都那么敏感，自从被他驳倒以来，我直生自己的气，不过我晓得他心里疼我，他说主是头一个社会主义者，他叫我烦得很，无论我怎么惹他，他也不发脾气，横竖他懂得很多杂七杂八的事儿尤其关于人体和内部的构造，我常常想读读那本家庭医学书，查一查咱们身体内部到底是怎么回事，屋子里挤满了人的时候，我总听得出他的声音，然后就观察他我假装由于他的缘故跟她生分了，因为他这个人一向有点儿好嫉妒，当他问我到哪儿去的时候我就说要去看弗洛伊，他还送给我一本拜伦勋爵的诗集和三双手套呢这档子事就算了结啦，我知道怎样就能轻而易举地让他去恢复旧好，这是随时都办得到的，我甚至猜他跟她已经言归于好，并且到什么地方去跟她见面啦，要是他不肯吃蒜我就晓得了，我的办法多着哩，让他整理一下我衬衫的领子啦，临出门的时候蒙上面纱戴好手套摸摸他啦，再吻他一下啦，就会把这些男人个个弄得滴溜转再正经的也是一样，那么就让他到她那儿去好啦，她当然高兴极了，假装爱他都爱疯啦，我才不在乎呢，我干脆就走到她跟前，问她爱不爱他，我直勾勾地瞪着她她才欺骗不了我呢，他倒是可能以为自己爱上了她，就像当初对我那么用他那又肉感又黏乎乎儿含混不清的腔调向她求爱哩，不过我费了好大劲儿才把他这句话掏出来，可我喜欢他这一点，因为这表示他有抑制力，不是那种只要对方一开口就能搞到手的人，那天晚上我在厨房擀土豆饼的时候，他趁机想向我求爱，说我有点儿话想跟你说，我给他浇了冷水，我正发着脾气，手上和胳膊上沾满了面糊，反正头天晚上我谈做梦就把心事泄露得太多了，所以我不愿意让他知道那些听了对他没好处的事，只要他在场乔西就非拥抱我不可，紧紧地趴在我身上，心里只当那是他喽当我说我尽量把浑身上下都洗到了，她就问，难道你连那儿都洗到了吗，只要有他在场，女人们总是一个劲儿把话茬儿往那上头引，好跟他套近乎，一扯到这类话题他就装出一副漠不关心的样子，狡黠地微微眨巴一只眼，她们完全清楚他是个什么样的人，简直把他惯坏啦，我一点儿也不觉得奇怪，因为他当年长得挺帅，直想模仿拜伦勋爵的派头，我说我喜欢他这副样子，不过作为一个男人来说，他太俊了些，我们订婚之前他倒是还有那么一点儿，那天我一阵阵地大笑，后来她显得不大高兴啦，反正我咯咯咯地笑个不停，发夹一个接一个地往下掉，弄得披头散发的，你总是那么开心，她说，嗯，因为这叫她眼红，因为她晓得这意味着什么，因为我经常告诉她不少我们之间的事儿，不是全部，只是刚刚够让她流口水，这可不是我的过错我们结婚后她不大上门来了，我倒是想知道她如今过得怎么样啦，自从跟那位半疯不傻的丈夫过日子以来，她就开始扭歪着脸，一副精疲力竭的样子，上回我瞧见她的时候她准是刚跟他吵了一架，因为我一眼就看出，她一个劲儿地往丈夫这个话题上面扯议论自己的丈夫，讲他的坏话，她告诉我什么来着，对啦，说她丈夫一旦着了魔，有时候穿着沾满了泥的靴子就上床，想想看吧，得跟那样一个家伙睡在一张床上，随时都可能被他杀害的啊，这叫什么男人呀，喏，就算是发了疯，也不见得个个都变得像他那样，波尔迪无论干些什么名堂，反正下雨也好，晴天也好，从外面回来总在垫子上擦擦靴底再进屋，他总把自己的靴子擦得锃亮，而且路上遇见人老是脱脱帽，可他呢，居然趿拉着拖鞋就去走街串巷，一心想凭着一张万事休矣完蛋的明信片弄到一万英镑，哦亲爱的梅，像这样的事让你腻烦得简直不想活啦，笨得竟然连自己的靴子都不会脱，喔唷，像这种人你有什么办法呀，我宁可死掉二十回也不肯另嫁给这样一个男人，当然喽，他也永远找不到第二个像我这样肯迁就他的女人啦，要想了解我，就来跟我睡觉吧，嗯，在内心深处他也晓得这一点，就拿那个毒死丈夫的梅布里克太太来说吧，为的是什么呢，真奇怪，是不是另外有了情夫呢，嗯，后来败露啦，居然干出这等事，难道她不是个地地道道的坏蛋吗，当然喽，有些男人就是讨厌透顶，简直能把你逼疯，满嘴都是天底下最恶毒的字眼儿，要是我们坏到这个地步，当初他们干吗还非要我们嫁给他们不可呢，嗯，那是因为他们没有我们就过不了日子，她把黏蝇纸上的砒霜刮下来放进他的茶里了，不就是这样的吗，我纳闷儿他们为什么给起了这么个名字，我要是问他，他就会说是从希腊文来的，听他这么解释，我一点儿也不开窍，她准是把另外那小子爱得发了疯，才去冒这被绞死的危险，哦，她还满不在乎哩，这要是她的天性的话她又能怎么着呢，而且他们也不至于像禽兽一般，忍心去把一个女人绞死，他们是绝不会的"

<div class="line_en">Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting to that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Illnever be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get blood poisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because die day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room for the matches to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water i woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to bealone with her l wouldn't lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much I saw too that her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May Moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some Dean or Bishop was sitting beside me in the jews Temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the German Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldn't mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the buUneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didn't like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am 11 suppose he was thinking of his father I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liquor Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted one with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time we took die port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up as if the world was coming to an end God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar and they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp yes because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my We felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasn't such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull it out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and MinaPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ear supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixed up things especially about the body and the insides I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when die room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had on a coolness with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of lord Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I kiss then would send them all spinning however ahight well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration with his plabbery kind of a manner to her like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him offsetting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyway whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like that and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £10000 for a postcard up up O Sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，为他从来也没那么做过，让把带两个鸡蛋的早餐送到他床头去吃，自打在市徽饭店就没这么过，那阵子他常在床上装病，嗓音病病囊囊，摆出一副亲王派头，好赢得那个干瘪老太婆赖尔登的欢心，他自以为老太婆会听他摆布呢，可她一个铜板也没给咱留下，全都献给了弥撒，为她自己和她的灵魂，简直是天底下头一号抠门鬼，连为自己喝的那杯掺了木精的酒都怕掏四便士，净对我讲她害的这个病那个病，没完没了地絮叨她那套政治啦，地震啦，世界末日啦，咱们找点儿乐子不好吗，唉要是全世界的女人都像她那样可够呛，把游泳衣和袒胸夜礼服都给骂苦了，当然喽，谁也不会要她去穿这样的衣服，想必正因为没有一个男人会对她多看上一眼，她信教才信得那么虔诚，但愿我永远不会变得像她那样，奇怪的是她倒没要求我们把脸蒙起来，话又说回来啦，她的确是个受过良好教育的女人，她就是唠唠叨叨地三句话不离赖尔登先生，我觉得他摆脱了她才叫高兴哩，还有她那只狗，总嗅我的毛皮衣服，老是往我的衬裙里面钻，尤其是身上来了的时候，不过我还是喜欢他对那样的老太婆有礼貌，无论对端盘子的还是对叫花子，他都是这样，向来也不摆空架子，但也不会老是这个样儿，要是他真有什么严重的毛病，住院要好得多，那儿什么都那么干净，可我想我得催上他一个月他才肯答应，嗯，可医院里又会出现个护士，他会赖着不肯出院，一直到被他们赶了出来，兴许那护士还是个修女呢，就像他身上带着的那张下流相片上的，不过那女的跟我一样才不是什么修女呢，嗯，因为男人们一生病就软弱起来，净说些没出息的话，要是没有个女人照料就好不了，要是他流了鼻血，那可就不得了啦，那回在糖锥山参加合唱团的野餐会，他在离南环路不远的地方扭伤了脚，他脸上那神情活像是快要呜呼哀哉似的，那天我穿的是那件衣服，斯塔克小姐给他送来了花儿，是她在筐底儿上所能找到的最蹩脚的蔫花儿，她死乞白赖非要钻进男人的卧室不可，用她那老姑娘嗓门儿说话，仿佛他都快为她的缘故死啦，那么一来就再也看不到你的脸啦，他躺在床上，胡子长长了一些，更像个男子汉啦，爹也曾是这样的，我就讨厌给缠绷带啦喂药唔的，当他用剃胡刀去割鸡眼大趾出血的时候，我直害怕他会害上败血症，假若害病的是我，倒想瞧瞧能得到什么样的照料，不过当然喽，妇道人家总是隐瞒自己的病情，省得给人添所有那些麻烦，她们就是这样的，嗯，他到什么地方去过从他的食欲来看，这我是有把握的，不管怎样总不会是在搞恋爱，不然的话净想娘儿们就吃不下东西啦，要不就是半夜里在街上拉客的窑姐儿，要是他真到那儿去过那么说什么去了饭店就左不过是他存心蒙骗编出的一套谎话喽，海因斯把我留住啦，我碰见谁来着，啊，嗯，我碰见了门顿，你记得吗，另外还有谁来着，让我想想看，我想起他那张大娃娃脸了，他刚结婚没多久就在普尔万景画会上跟个小妞儿调起情来啦，我就把背掉了过去，他偷偷儿地溜掉啦，看上去怪害臊的，这又碍着什么事儿啦，可有一回竟然冒冒失失地向我讨起好来了，亏他干得出，自以为了不起，大嘴巴肿眼泡儿，是我见过的天底下头号笨蛋，大家还喊他作律师呢，我可不愿意在床上那么长篇大论的，不然的话那就是他在什么地方结交的，要不就是偷偷搞到手的小婊子，要是她们跟我一样了解他的话，嗯，前天我去前屋取火柴并且把报纸上迪格纳穆的讣告拿给他看的时候，他正唰唰唰地写着什么信哪，他用吸墨纸把它盖住，假装在想什么生意上的事，那很可能就是写给某人的，那个女的必定认为他是个冤大头，因为所有的男人到了他这把年纪多少就会变成这样，尤其他现在已经快四十岁啦，所以女的就甜言蜜语尽量骗他的钱，再也没有比老傻瓜更傻的啦，接着又为了遮掩，就像往常那样吻我屁股，他究竟跟谁干着这名堂或是老早就相好了，我一点儿也不在乎，尽管我还是想弄清楚，只要他们俩别总是在我鼻子底下，就像我们在翁塔利奥高台街的时候雇的那个浪娘儿们玛丽似的，为了教他上劲儿，就垫了个假屁股，从他身上闻到了那些搽了脂粉的娘儿们的气味，真恶心有一两回我倒是真起了疑心，把他叫过来的时候发现他外衣上巴着根长头发，可没见那个的影子，我到厨房去一瞧，他正在那儿假装喝水哪，对他们来说只有一个女人是不够的，当然喽全都怪他，把底下人都惯坏啦，你看多奇怪，还提出过可不可以让她在圣诞节的时候跟咱们同桌吃饭哪，哦那可不行，在我家绝不能这样，偷我的土豆，还有二先令六便士一打的牡蛎，去看望她的姑妈，哦，简直是公然抢劫啦，我敢说他跟那个娘儿们有点儿不干不净，这种事儿我总能弄个水落石出，他说拿不出证据来，我抓到了她的证据，哦对，她姑妈特爱吃牡蛎，我把我对她的看法告诉了他，他竟然拐弯抹角想打发我出去，好跟她单独在一起，我才不会降低身份去暗中监视他们哩，星期五她出去的时候我在她房里看到一副袜带，这就太不像话啦，做得过分了点儿，当我限她一星期后卷铺盖，她把脸都气肿了，我看索性不要女仆的好，我自个儿收拾屋子更麻利哩，就是做饭倒垃圾可够讨厌的，反正我告诉了他，要是不辞退她我就离开这个家，只要一想到他曾经跟那么个肮脏无耻满嘴瞎话的邋遢女人在一块儿来着，我就连碰也不肯碰他啦，她当着我的面抵赖，到处唱着歌儿，连在厕所里都唱，因为她晓得自己撞上了好运气，嗯，因为他绝不可能那么久都不搞，他就得到什么地方去搞上一通，最后一回是什么时候从后面跟我搞来着，那天晚上沿着托尔卡河走去的时候博伊兰使劲攥了一下我的手，另一只手悄悄地伸到我手里，我只用大拇指按了按他的手背，回攥了一下，唱着五月的新月喜洋洋，宝贝，因为他对他和我的关系有看法，他才不是那么个傻瓜呢，他说什么在外面吃饭啦，到欢乐剧场去啦，反正我不让他得到满足，不管怎样，与其什么时候都老是戴同一顶旧帽子，他确实使我换了换口味，除非我花钱雇个漂亮小伙子来搞，我自己搞不了嘛，男孩子会喜欢我的，跟他单独在一起的时候，我会叫他神魂颠倒，我让他看看我的袜带，那副崭新的，把他弄得满脸通红，拿眼睛盯着他，勾引他，我晓得脸蛋儿上长出又细又软的短须的那些男孩儿怎样想，他们净整个钟头地把那物儿拽出来自己解闷儿啦，然后就一问一答，你会跟那个送煤的干这档子那档子和另外一档子事吗，对啦，跟一位主教呢，对啦，我会干的，我告诉他当我在犹太教堂的院子里正编织毛衣的时候，一位教长要么是个主教就坐在我身边那人对都柏林不熟悉，净问啥纪念碑啦，那是啥地方啦，一提起那些雕像我就腻味透啦，一鼓励他，他就更不像话啦，竟问起我，眼下你心上有谁呀，你想着谁哪是谁呀，把他的名字告诉我吧，是谁呀，告诉我，是谁呀，德国皇上吗，嗯，那么你就把我当作那位皇上好啦，思念他吧，你能感觉得到他吗，哦，居然想让我当婊子，他永远也做不到，如今他都到这把年纪了，应该收摊儿啦，他给任何女人带来的都只能是毁灭，一点儿也得不到满足，还得装出一副喜欢的样子，直到他丢了精，我也只好自己了结，弄得连嘴唇都苍白了，不管怎样如今一了百了，世人成天谈论这种事儿，其实只有头一回才算个数，以后就成了家常便饭啦，连想都不去想它，为什么非得先嫁给一个男人才许跟他接吻呢，有时候你爱得发狂，觉得非那么着不可，浑身发酥，简直不由自主啦，我巴不得迟早有那么一天旁边有个男人搂住我亲嘴，什么也比不上个长长的热吻，麻酥酥的，一直热到你的魂儿里，我讨厌做忏悔，那阵子我常到科里根神父那儿去忏悔，他摸了摸我，神父，那么他对你造成什么损害了吗，在哪儿，我像个傻子似的说，在运河堤岸上，但是我的孩子，在你身上哪一带，是腿后边高处吗，对吗，嗯，挺高的，就是你用来坐的那个部位，嗯哦老天爷，难道他就不能干脆说声屁股，不就结了吗，这跟那有什么关系，那么你有没有，我忘记他是怎么说的了，没有，神父，而且我总是想到真正的父亲，他想知道什么呢，因为当我向天主忏悔完了之后，他有着一双肥肥胖胖挺好看的手手心总是发湿，摸摸这只手我倒也不在意，他也未尝不是这样，我望着套在他那公牛脖子上的白圈圈就琢磨，我倒想知道他认没认出待在忏悔阁子里的我，我看得见他的脸，当然喽我的脸他是瞧不见的，他也绝没有朝这边望，连点儿苗头都没有，尽管这样可当他父亲死的时候他两眼都红了，当然喽，他们对女人已经死了心当一个男人哭鼻子的时候该是挺可怕的事，他们就更不必说啦，我倒是巴不得让这些穿法衣的人当中的一个抱一阵，他身上散发着教皇那样的馨香，而且你要是个有夫之妇，跟教士在一起就更没有危险啦，他对自己再小心不过啦，然后再献上点儿什么给教皇大人来赎罪，我倒想知道他对我满不满足，他临走的时候在门厅里熟头熟脑地朝我屁股拍了一巴掌，我讨厌他这下子，不过我只是笑了笑，我可不是一匹马或一头驴啊，我不是吧，我猜想当时他正怀念他的祖先来着，我倒想知道这会子他是不是在醒着，正想念着我，或正在做梦，他梦里有我吗，那花儿是谁送给他的呢，他说是买的，他身上有股酒味儿，不是威士忌，也不是黑啤酒，也许是贴传单的时候用的那种甜丝丝糨糊气味的酒哩，我倒想啜上一口，看上去像是挺有滋味的名贵的绿黄色酒，是专门给那些戴歌剧帽在后台口出出进进的公子哥儿喝的，有一回那个带着一只松鼠的美国人跟爹谈邮票生意，我用手指头蘸着尝了尝，最后干的那回，他使劲挣扎着才没有睡着，我们刚喝完葡萄酒，吃罢肉罐头，那肉咸咸的挺有滋味，嗯，因为我觉得又快活又疲倦，刚一躺到床上就沉沉地睡熟啦，直到打雷才把我吵醒，天主饶恕我们吧，我以为会遭到天罚哩，就画了个十字，念了一遍圣母经，那雷就跟直布罗陀的一样可怕，仿佛世界末日到来了似的，然后他们又来告诉你天主并不存在，可像那样哗哗地奔流，你能怎么办呢，一点儿办法也没有，只好悔罪呗，那天傍晚我在白修士街教堂为五月点了支蜡烛它带来了好运，不过他要是听说了，他准会嘲笑的，因为他向来不进教堂去望弥撒或参加早课晚课，他说，你的灵魂，你没有灵魂，里面只有脑灰质，因为他不晓得拥有灵魂是怎么回事，对啦，我点上灯，因为他那红兽般的巨大玩意儿足足丢了三四回，我担心那上头的血管，或随便怎么叫吧，会胀破的，尽管他的鼻子倒并不怎么大，我曾花好半天工夫去梳妆打扮喷洒香水，然后把百叶窗撂下，并脱得赤条条的，那玩意儿像根铁棍，要不就是粗铁撬，直直地那么竖着，他想必是吃了牡蛎，一定吃了好几打，他那大嗓门儿就像唱歌一样，不，我一辈子也没觉出任何人有那么大的阳物，使你感到填得满满的，事后他准吃掉了一整只羊，干吗在咱们身子中间开那么个大洞，像匹种马似的猛冲进来，因为这就是他们在你身上所要的一切，他的眼神儿是那么不顾一切，那么凶狠，我只好眯起眼睛，他那玩意儿可从来没这么雄壮过，于是我让他把那玩意儿拽出来，在我肚子上抽，想到它那么大这样就好多了，以防止没彻底地冲洗干净，最后一次我让他丢在我里面了，这是在女人身上做的一个多么好的发明，好让男人尽情地快活一场，可要是什么人哪怕让他尝到一点点个中滋味，他们就会明白我为了生米莉受过多大罪啦，谁都不会相信还有她刚长牙那阵子，还有米娜普里福伊的丈夫，摇摆着那副络腮胡子，每年往她身子里填进一个娃娃或一对双胞胎，跟钟表一样地准，她身上总是发出一股娃娃气味，他们给一个娃娃起名叫布杰斯什么的，那模样儿活脱儿像黑人，头发乱蓬蓬的耶稣小家伙，娃娃黑黝黝，上回我到那儿去，只见足足有一小队娃娃们，都在争先恐后，大喊大叫，你连自己的耳朵都听不见啦，想来都很健康，男人们非把女人弄得像大象那么浑身胀鼓鼓的才心满意足，可也难说，我要是冒一次险怀上个不是他的娃娃会怎么样呢，不过假若他结了婚，我相信准能养下个漂亮结实的娃娃可也难说，波尔迪的劲头来得更足呢，嗯，那样一来该多么有趣啊，我猜想他是因为碰见了乔西鲍威尔，还有那档子葬礼，又记起我跟博伊兰的事儿，所以就兴奋起来了，喏，随便他怎么去想吧，只要他称心就好，我知道当我出现的时候他们两个已经有点儿勾勾搭搭啦，乔治娜辛普森举行新屋落成宴的那个晚上，他跟她跳舞，还一块儿坐在外面，他千方百计让我相信那是由于不忍心看到她被冷落，坐在一边当墙花，我们为了政治问题大吵一通，是他开的头，可不是我，他说咱们的天主是个木匠，最后他把我弄哭了，女人对什么事都那么敏感，自从被他驳倒以来，我直生自己的气，不过我晓得他心里疼我，他说主是头一个社会主义者，他叫我烦得很，无论我怎么惹他，他也不发脾气，横竖他懂得很多杂七杂八的事儿尤其关于人体和内部的构造，我常常想读读那本家庭医学书，查一查咱们身体内部到底是怎么回事，屋子里挤满了人的时候，我总听得出他的声音，然后就观察他我假装由于他的缘故跟她生分了，因为他这个人一向有点儿好嫉妒，当他问我到哪儿去的时候我就说要去看弗洛伊，他还送给我一本拜伦勋爵的诗集和三双手套呢这档子事就算了结啦，我知道怎样就能轻而易举地让他去恢复旧好，这是随时都办得到的，我甚至猜他跟她已经言归于好，并且到什么地方去跟她见面啦，要是他不肯吃蒜我就晓得了，我的办法多着哩，让他整理一下我衬衫的领子啦，临出门的时候蒙上面纱戴好手套摸摸他啦，再吻他一下啦，就会把这些男人个个弄得滴溜转再正经的也是一样，那么就让他到她那儿去好啦，她当然高兴极了，假装爱他都爱疯啦，我才不在乎呢，我干脆就走到她跟前，问她爱不爱他，我直勾勾地瞪着她她才欺骗不了我呢，他倒是可能以为自己爱上了她，就像当初对我那么用他那又肉感又黏乎乎儿含混不清的腔调向她求爱哩，不过我费了好大劲儿才把他这句话掏出来，可我喜欢他这一点，因为这表示他有抑制力，不是那种只要对方一开口就能搞到手的人，那天晚上我在厨房擀土豆饼的时候，他趁机想向我求爱，说我有点儿话想跟你说，我给他浇了冷水，我正发着脾气，手上和胳膊上沾满了面糊，反正头天晚上我谈做梦就把心事泄露得太多了，所以我不愿意让他知道那些听了对他没好处的事，只要他在场乔西就非拥抱我不可，紧紧地趴在我身上，心里只当那是他喽当我说我尽量把浑身上下都洗到了，她就问，难道你连那儿都洗到了吗，只要有他在场，女人们总是一个劲儿把话茬儿往那上头引，好跟他套近乎，一扯到这类话题他就装出一副漠不关心的样子，狡黠地微微眨巴一只眼，她们完全清楚他是个什么样的人，简直把他惯坏啦，我一点儿也不觉得奇怪，因为他当年长得挺帅，直想模仿拜伦勋爵的派头，我说我喜欢他这副样子，不过作为一个男人来说，他太俊了些，我们订婚之前他倒是还有那么一点儿，那天我一阵阵地大笑，后来她显得不大高兴啦，反正我咯咯咯地笑个不停，发夹一个接一个地往下掉，弄得披头散发的，你总是那么开心，她说，嗯，因为这叫她眼红，因为她晓得这意味着什么，因为我经常告诉她不少我们之间的事儿，不是全部，只是刚刚够让她流口水，这可不是我的过错我们结婚后她不大上门来了，我倒是想知道她如今过得怎么样啦，自从跟那位半疯不傻的丈夫过日子以来，她就开始扭歪着脸，一副精疲力竭的样子，上回我瞧见她的时候她准是刚跟他吵了一架，因为我一眼就看出，她一个劲儿地往丈夫这个话题上面扯议论自己的丈夫，讲他的坏话，她告诉我什么来着，对啦，说她丈夫一旦着了魔，有时候穿着沾满了泥的靴子就上床，想想看吧，得跟那样一个家伙睡在一张床上，随时都可能被他杀害的啊，这叫什么男人呀，喏，就算是发了疯，也不见得个个都变得像他那样，波尔迪无论干些什么名堂，反正下雨也好，晴天也好，从外面回来总在垫子上擦擦靴底再进屋，他总把自己的靴子擦得锃亮，而且路上遇见人老是脱脱帽，可他呢，居然趿拉着拖鞋就去走街串巷，一心想凭着一张万事休矣完蛋的明信片弄到一万英镑，哦亲爱的梅，像这样的事让你腻烦得简直不想活啦，笨得竟然连自己的靴子都不会脱，喔唷，像这种人你有什么办法呀，我宁可死掉二十回也不肯另嫁给这样一个男人，当然喽，他也永远找不到第二个像我这样肯迁就他的女人啦，要想了解我，就来跟我睡觉吧，嗯，在内心深处他也晓得这一点，就拿那个毒死丈夫的梅布里克太太来说吧，为的是什么呢，真奇怪，是不是另外有了情夫呢，嗯，后来败露啦，居然干出这等事，难道她不是个地地道道的坏蛋吗，当然喽，有些男人就是讨厌透顶，简直能把你逼疯，满嘴都是天底下最恶毒的字眼儿，要是我们坏到这个地步，当初他们干吗还非要我们嫁给他们不可呢，嗯，那是因为他们没有我们就过不了日子，她把黏蝇纸上的砒霜刮下来放进他的茶里了，不就是这样的吗，我纳闷儿他们为什么给起了这么个名字，我要是问他，他就会说是从希腊文来的，听他这么解释，我一点儿也不开窍，她准是把另外那小子爱得发了疯，才去冒这被绞死的危险，哦，她还满不在乎哩，这要是她的天性的话她又能怎么着呢，而且他们也不至于像禽兽一般，忍心去把一个女人绞死，他们是绝不会的">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Foldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish Times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Illstick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street well and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Illtell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and I'll take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to inquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I half turned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santissima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to End out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing a letter every morning sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then he wouldnt believe next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow Concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down die platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the Jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffith is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner Lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lanes Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave they've lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going around with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating either can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stop press tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didn't want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kick up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Illhave to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Illknow by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Illonly have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/-in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Illlash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Illbe 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the Jersey Lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing around her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master François somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a -- e as if any fool wouldn't know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with the old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H. R. H. he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a wedding cake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shop girl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble whats she there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls diem I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Illget him to keep that up and Illtake those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holies street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has the nymphs used they go about like that I asked him that disgusting Cameron Highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye orif it was i of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang or something there and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in No 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the Belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the dock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们个个都那么不一样，博伊兰总在谈论我这双脚的形状，人家还没把他介绍给我之前他就马上注意到了，当时我正跟波尔迪一道在都柏林面包公司，我摇晃着两条腿，边笑边想听他说话，我们各要了两杯茶，一份面包和一客黄油，当我站起来的时候，我瞧见他正跟他那两位当了老姑娘的姐妹坐在一起朝我望着，我问女侍厕所在哪儿，都快憋不住了，我还在乎什么，都怪他要我买的那条严实的黑色紧身裤，花半个钟头才脱得下来，把身上弄得浸湿，每隔一星期就得换一套崭新的时装，待了那么半天，我竟把我那双小山羊皮手套丢在后面座子上啦，再也没找回来说不定被什么女贼拿走啦，他要我在爱尔兰时报上登个广告，说是在戴姆街都柏林面包公司女厕所里丢的，拾到者送交玛莉恩布卢姆太太，从旋转门往外走的时候我瞅见他正拿两眼盯着我的脚哪，我回头一望，他还在望着我，两天之后我去那儿喝茶，原指望，可他没在，我的脚怎么会叫他兴奋起来的呢，因为当我们在另一间屋子的时候我正跷着二郎腿来着，起初他指的是我那双鞋走起路来太箍脚，我的手好看得很哪，我要是戴上一只镶了漂亮的蓝晶的戒指该有多好哇，那是我过生日那个月的宝石，我非让他给我买一只不可，再饶上一只金镯子，我并不怎么喜欢我这双脚，不过古德温那个搞得一团糟的演奏会结束的那个晚上，我让他把玩过我的脚，天那么冷，又刮着风，唷，我们家里有甘蔗酒，加上糖和香料，烫热了再喝，那是在西伦巴德街，他要我脱下长袜躺在壁炉前的地毯上的时候，炉火还没灭，另外一回是让我穿着那双沾满了泥巴的长靴子，只要见到马粪就踩，当然喽他不像世上一般人那么正常，他是怎么说的来着，说是即便十分当中让给凯蒂兰内尔九分，我都能赢，我问他这话是什么意思，我记不起他是怎么说的了，因为叫卖最终版的报童刚好走了过去，卢肯牛奶店那个鬈发男人是那么讲礼数，我想以前仿佛在什么地方跟他见过面，我正尝黄油的时候注意上他了，所以就成心磨磨蹭蹭地拖延着时间，还有他常常拿来取笑打趣的巴特尔达西，我唱完古诺的圣母颂后，他在通往唱诗班席位的台阶上吻起我来了，咱们还等什么呀，啊唷我的心肝儿，吻我脑门儿并分手，还有我那褐色部位，别瞧他嗓门儿小，可热劲儿挺大一向对我唱的低音喜欢得发狂，要是他说的是真话，我就爱他唱歌时的口型，然后他说，在这样的地方干这种事儿有多么可怕啊，我可不觉得有什么可怕的，迟早有一天我会告诉他的，不是现在，让他吓一跳，唉，而且我还把他领到那儿去，让他看看我们干事的那个地方，喏，就在那儿，你高兴也罢不高兴也罢，他以为没有他不知道的事，我们订婚之前他对我母亲毫无所知，不然的话他是不会那么容易地把我搞到手的，不管怎样，他比我要糟上十倍，曾央求我从衬裤上剪下一小片来给他，那个傍晚我们沿着凯尼尔沃思广场走去的时候，他吻了吻我戴的手套上的饰孔我只好把手套脱下来，他问了我一些问题，可不可以打听一下你那间卧室的形状呢于是我假装忘记了手套的事，好让他保存下来，心里念着我，这当儿我瞅见他把手套偷偷放进兜儿里啦，当然喽，他对衬裤简直着了迷，这一点一眼就看得出，两眼总是直勾勾地盯着那些骑自行车的厚脸皮丫头，她们的裙子被风一刮，连肚脐眼儿都露出来啦，甚至米莉和我跟他一道参加郊游会那回，有个穿奶油色平纹细布的娘儿们就逆着阳光站在那儿，连她贴身的内衣他都看个一清二楚，有一回他瞧见了我就冒着雨从背后追了上来，不过，早在他见到我之前，我就瞅见他站在哈罗德十字路口角儿上啦，穿着崭新的雨衣，为了使脸色显得更鲜活，围了一条茶褐色围巾戴着顶褐色帽子，像平素间那样看上去滑头滑脑的，那个地方跟他毫不相干，他究竟在那儿干什么呢，男人可以随意到哪儿去，爱向穿裙子的索取什么就索取什么你还不能过问，可他们就是想知道你究竟到哪儿去啦，你要到哪儿去，我能觉察出他一路躲躲闪闪地总跟在我后面，一双眼睛死死盯着我的脖子，他一直避开我们家他觉得越来越不便于上门啦，于是我就侧过身去，停下脚步，然后他就缠着我，要我说声好吧，到头来我边望着他边慢慢腾腾地摘下手套，他说像这么个雨天我那网眼袖子搪不了寒，好歹找个借口来伸手挨近我的身子呗，好半天他始终在念叨衬裤衬裤的，直到我答应把玩偶穿着的那条衬裤扒下来送给他，让他揣在背心的兜儿里随身带着，噢，至圣者玛利亚他浑身上下给雨淋得湿透啦，活像个大傻瓜，他长了一口非常漂亮的牙齿，我看着肚子都饿了，他央求我撩起身上那条有着日光线型褶子的橙色衬裙，他说左近一个人也没有，要是我不这么做，他就在水洼子里下跪他是那么死乞白赖，身上那件崭新的雨衣也会给糟蹋啦，你简直不晓得单独跟你在一起的时候他们会怎样地异想天开，要是有人路过，他们会为了那个变得很粗野，所以我就稍微撩了撩裙子，隔着他的长裤摸了摸，就像我常用戴戒指的手对加德纳所做的那样，免得他在这么大庭广众之下干出什么更荒唐的事儿来，我倒是很想知道他究竟行没行过割礼，他浑身直筛糠，他们无论做什么事都过于急躁，图个痛痛快快乐上一通，害得爹眼巴巴地等着我回去吃饭，他教我说，我把钱包落在肉铺里啦，只好回去取一趟，好个扯谎大家，接着他又写来那封信，上面全是那种话跟他在一起的时候，瞧他那个德行，他怎么还有脸去见任何一个女人呢，事后弄得多尴尬啊，我们碰见的时候，他问我，生我的气了吗，我当然耷拉着眼皮，他看出了我并没生他的气，他还有几分头脑，不像另外那个傻瓜亨尼多伊尔，玩哑剧字谜游戏的时候，不是弄坏什么就是扯破什么，我就讨厌不走运的男人，他问我懂不懂得那是什么意思，为了体面起见，我当然只好说不懂得嘞，我说我就不懂得你说的是什么意思，这不是蛮自然的吗，当然喽，这个字常写在直布罗陀的墙壁上旁边还附着女人那个部位的图像，我在任何地方也没看到过这个字，不过，太小的娃娃可不适宜看，于是他就每天早晨都写封信来，有时候一天写两封，我喜欢他做爱的方式，他懂得怎样叫女人着迷，那当儿他给我送来了八大朵罂粟花，因为我的生日是八号，于是我写了封信，那天晚上他在海豚仓吻了我的胸口，身上那股劲儿没法儿形容，简直像登天啦，但是他从来也不像加德纳那么会拥抱，我希望他星期一会上门来，像他说过的那样，还是在同一时刻，四点钟，我就恨那些不管什么时候都找上门来的，你还以为是蔬菜店的呢，开门一看原来是旁的什么人，而你呢已经把全身的衣服都脱掉了，要么就是又肮脏又邋遢的厨房那扇门被风刮得敞开啦满脸皱纹的老古德温为了演奏会的事儿到伦巴德街来找我的那一天，我刚吃完饭为了炖那破菜弄得我满脸通红，乱糟糟的，我只好说，别朝我看，教授，我这副样子真见不得人啊，嗯，这位老先生可是个地地道道的正派人，他的一举一动再可敬不过啦，又没有人替你说声不在家，你只好隔着百叶窗偷偷往外边瞧，就像对今儿那个送官的似的，他先派人送来葡萄酒和桃子，起初我还只当是为了改期呢，我开始打起哈欠来啦，以为他在耍弄我呢，心里好焦躁，这当儿我听见他嗒嗒嗒嗒的敲门声，他准是来晚了一会儿，因为三点一刻光景我曾瞧见迪达勒斯家的两个姑娘放学回去，我一向弄不清钟点，连他给我的那块表好像也从来没准过，我想找人去修一修，当我一边用口哨吹着有位我心爱的漂亮姑娘，一边丢一便士给那唱着为了英国为了家园和丽人的瘸腿水手的时候，我甚至既没换件干净衬衣，也没化妆，什么都还没做呢，而且下礼拜的这一天就该到贝尔法斯特去啦，他也一样得去恩尼斯，二十七日是他爹的忌辰嘛，要是他那样的话可就不会愉快了，假定我们旅馆的房间是紧挨着的，又在新床上干了点什么傻事，我可不能叫他住手，别缠着我，因为他就在隔壁房间里那里，也许住着个新教牧师，边咳嗽，边敲墙第二天他绝不会相信我们什么也没干，丈夫好对付，你可哄骗不了情人，事后告诉他，我们什么也没干，他当然没相信我，没有，他不如随便到任何地方去再说，他总会惹出什么事儿来的，上次我们到马里伯勒去参加马洛音乐会，他为自己和我叫了两份滚烫的汤，这当儿铃响了，他就沿着月台走去，边走边一勺一勺地喝着汤，一路上四下里洒着，脸皮也够厚的了吧，伙计尖声喊叫着追在他后面天哪，可让我们丢尽了丑，还有火车头开动前的那场混乱，但是他一定等喝完了才肯付账，坐在三等车厢里的两位先生还说他做得很对呢，倒也是，当他脑子里一旦有了什么念头，有时候就梗得要命，他居然用小刀子撬开了车厢门，真是做了件好事，不然的话火车就会把我们一直带到科克郡去啦，我猜想那是出于对他的报复噢，我多么喜欢坐有着可爱的柔软靠垫的火车或马车去做短途游览，我倒是想知道他肯不肯为我买一张头等车厢的票，他大概还想在火车上搞呢，所以就给列车员一大笔小费，哎呀，我相信照例会有一些无聊的男人，用无比愚蠢的眼神，张着嘴呆呆地看我们俩呢，我们去霍斯岛那回碰上的那位普通工人可真大不一样，他让我们俩单独留在车厢里，我想了解一下关于他的一些情况，钻过一两个隧道，然后你朝窗外望就更有趣儿啦，接着是回程，要是我永远不回来了，他们会怎么说呢说是跟他私奔啦，那样我在舞台上就会大出风头啦，我最后一次是在哪儿的音乐会登台演唱来着，那是一年多以前的事啦，是什么时候呢，在克拉伦敦街的圣女德肋撒会堂，如今晚儿在那里唱歌的净是些小黄毛丫头，眼下是凯思琳卡尼和她那号人在演唱，由于我爹在军队里待过，我曾演唱过心神恍惚的乞丐，还佩戴着一枚纪念罗伯茨勋爵的胸针哩，当时我显然是个爱尔兰人，波尔迪的爱尔兰味却还不足，那回的经纪人是他吧，他到处说他正在把光啊仁慈地引导配成曲子，这样就使得我能够在站立的圣母中演唱，其实是我怂恿他的，这一回我可不再让他那么做啦，可后来耶稣会士们发觉他是个共济会员，引导我前进的曲子是从什么古老歌剧里抄袭来的，在钢琴上使劲奏着，嗯，他近来又跟几名新芬党一道走动或者随便他们怎么称呼自己吧，谈着他平时说惯了的废话荒唐话，他说，他介绍给我的那个没系领带的小个子非常聪明，姓格里菲思，很有前途，哦，这我可看不出来，我也只能说到这儿，不过他想必是那样一个人，他晓得已经闹起抵制运动，我讨厌去提战后的政治，比勒陀利亚和莱迪史密斯和布隆方丹，第二东兰开斯特团第八营的斯坦利G加德纳陆军中尉就是在那儿害了一场伤寒而死的他穿上那身土黄色军服可帅啦，个子比我稍微高一点儿，刚好合适，我相信他一定挺勇敢，那晚上我们俩在运河船闸那儿接吻告别，他叫我做我的爱尔兰美人儿，他兴奋得脸色发白，他快要出发了，我们也许给人从路上瞧见啦，他连站都站不利索我浑身从来也没那么热过，他们蛮可以一开头就讲和嘛，要么就让老保尔大叔和另外一个老克留格尔去拼个死活，省得把战争这么拖上好几年让那些漂亮小伙子害热病死在那儿，哪怕是正正经经挨子弹死掉呢，事情还不至于这么糟糕，我爱看兵团的阅兵式，头一回是在拉罗什看西班牙骑兵，然后从阿尔赫西拉斯隔着海湾眺望，景色太可爱啦，直布罗陀的万家灯火就像萤火虫似的，还有在十五英亩地上举行的模拟战，穿着格子呢百褶短裙的黑警戒兵团，步伐一致地从威尔士亲王所统率的第十轻骑兵或枪骑兵跟前分列前进，噢，轻骑兵可真有气派，还有在图盖拉打过胜仗的都柏林兵，他爹就是把一群马卖给骑兵发的财，我既然给了他那么多，他蛮可以在贝尔法斯特给我买一份精致的礼物，那座城里有可爱的亚麻布衬衫被单，还有考究的和服什么的，我得去买早先有过的那种樟脑丸，跟衣物一道放在抽屉里，跟他一起在一座新到的城市里到处逛商店，买这些东西多么让人兴奋哟，还不如把这戒指撂在家里呢，非得在指关节那儿转来转去才摘得下来，那帮人要么就把我们的事儿登在报上，满城宣扬，要么就去报告警察，可他们会认为我们是一对夫妻，噢，就让他们统统闷死好啦，我才一点儿都不在乎呢反正他趁钱，又不是那种就要结婚的男人，所以还不如有人帮他花花呢，我要是能弄清楚他喜不喜欢我就好啦，当我搽粉时仔细照了照那面带把儿的小镜子，就发现脸色有点儿苍白，其实，镜子一向是不可靠的，倒也难怪，他那副坐骨老大从头到尾跨到我身上，他又那么笨重，胸脯上长满了毛，再饶上天儿又这么热，我老得躺在下面，还不如让他从后面搞倒好一些哩，正像马斯添斯基太太告诉我的，她丈夫就要她摆那种姿势，活像是两条狗似的，她还得把舌头能伸多长就伸多长，这当儿他还安详柔和地丁零零弹着他那把七弦琴，这些男人指不定会干出什么名堂来哪，你永远也追不上他们，他穿的那套蓝色衣裳可是上等料子做的哩领带的样式也挺时新，短袜跟上还用天蓝色丝线绣着花纹，他准阔得很哪，从他衣裳的剪裁和他那块沉甸甸的手表我就看得出来，但是当他出去买回那份最终版报纸后，有几分钟光景变得像个地地道道的恶魔啦，他撕碎了赛马券，怒火冲天地咒骂着，因为他输掉了二十金镑，他说是那匹跑赢了的黑马让他丢的这笔钱，半数是为我下的赌注，都怪利内翰为他出了这么个点子，他诅咒说，这个寄生虫该下十八层地狱，那回参加格伦克里的午餐会之后，我们乘马车摇摇晃晃地翻过羽床山沿着那漫长的路回去的时候，他对我放肆来着，市长大人也曾用那双色眯眯的眼睛打量我，我最初是在饭后吃甜食的时候留意到那个大异教徒维尔·狄龙的，我正在用牙齿嘎吧嘎吧地嗑着核桃壳，我巴不得能用手指把每一口鸡肉都撕下来，香喷喷，烤得焦黄焦黄的，要多嫩有多嫩，不过我并不想把盘子里的东西统统吃光，那些叉子和切鱼刀都是纯银的，还有检验印记哩，我巴不得有那么几把，其实我蛮可以假装摆弄着玩，很容易就能往我的皮手笼里塞进一副，哪怕在饭馆往喉咙里咽下那么一点点东西，你也得指望让他们清账，抠抠搜搜地喝上一杯茶，我们也要当成是莫大的荣幸，受了待见就得表示感谢，不管怎样，世界就是这么分成的假若老是这么下去的话，头一桩，我得要两件上等衬衣，可我不晓得他喜欢什么样的衬裤，他情愿我不穿衬裤，他不是说过吗，嗯，直布罗陀的姑娘们有一半根本就不穿衬裤，照天主当初造她们的那样赤条条的，那个唱曼诺拉的安达卢西亚姑娘并没怎么隐瞒她没穿的事，嗯，还有我那另一双人造丝长袜，刚穿一天就抽了一大片丝，今儿早晨我蛮可以退给卢尔斯，跟他们吵上一通，要求给调换一双可我还是打消了这个念头，免得心里更烦，说不定还会半路上撞上他，那就都泡了汤，我还想要一件柔软合身的胸衣，仕女上的广告标的价钱倒蛮便宜，还说胯裆那儿垫了层三角形松紧布，他替我把原有的这件补了一下，但还是不成广告上是怎么说来着，只要花上十一先令六便士就能减肥，消除臀部那难看的赘肉显出曲线美，我的肚子太大了点儿，得戒掉晚饭那杯烈性黑啤酒，可也许已经喝上瘾了呢，奥罗克那家店最后送来的那瓶都跑了气，像白水一样，他的钱赚得可容易啦，大家管他叫作拉里，过圣诞节的时候他给送来个脏巴兮兮的旧包包，装着一块没有糖霜的点心和一瓶泔水，他原想当作红葡萄酒来硬塞给人家，可谁都不肯喝但愿上天让他省下唾沫吧，不然的话我怕他会渴死呢，也许我该做做深呼吸运动我倒是想知道那种减肥药是不是多少有点儿灵验，我也许会喝过头，如今晚儿瘦削型的并不大时新了，我有好几副袜带呢，可只有今天绷的那副才是他用一号收到的那张支票给我买的，哦不，还有我昨天用光的化妆水，涂上去让我的皮肤那么鲜活，我一遍遍地告诉他到同一家店去再配一份，可别忘啦，说了多少遍，天晓得他究竟办了没有，反正一看瓶子就知道啦，要是没办，我看就只好用自己的尿来洗了，我这尿像是牛肉茶或鸡汤，掺上点儿苦熟脂和紫罗兰花汁，我觉得皮肤开始显得粗糙或有点儿苍老了，我烫了手指以后脱了层皮，下面的皮肤要细嫩多啦可惜并不都是那样，还有那四块廉价手绢儿，统共才值六先令，要是不讲究点儿仪表，这个世道你可确实混不出个名堂来，钱都一股脑儿花在吃的和房租上啦，我要是抓到了钱，就大把大把地花它个痛快，我总想将一把茶叶往壶里一丢拉倒，可他每回总要称一下分量，还磨成末儿，我要是买双旧的牛皮鞋回来，他就问，你喜欢这双新鞋吗，嗯，多少钱买的呀，我简直就没有衣裳可穿，那套棕色的衣服，还有裙子和短上衣，另外就是送到洗衣坊去的那一身，一共才三身，随便对哪个女人来说，这算得了什么呢，把这顶旧帽子的边檐剪下来补那一顶，男人们连理都不理睬你，女人们只当你没有丈夫，总想把你踩在脚底下，物价又天天飞涨，再过四年我就三十五啦，不，我是，我究竟多大岁数了呢，到九月我就三十三啦呃，真的吗，噢，喏，瞧瞧那位加尔布雷斯太太，她比我老多啦，上星期我出门时瞧见她了她的美貌在开始衰退，她当年可真美，把齐腰的浓密头发往后面一甩，就像住在格兰瑟姆街的吉蒂奥谢那样，我每天早晨头一桩事就是朝她那边望，看着她梳头她好像很赞赏自己那厚厚的头发，可惜直到我们搬走的头一天我才结识她，还有那位名叫泽西百合的兰特里夫人，威尔士亲王爱上了她，依我看他跟路上的随便哪个男人都是一样的，他只不过有个国王称号罢咧，这些男人全是一个模子里刻出来的，我只想试试黑人是什么样，她的美貌能维持到多少岁呢，四十五吧，关于她那个爱吃醋的老丈夫有件逗趣儿的故事，到底是怎么来着，他总是随身带着一把撬牡蛎刀，不，说是他教她围起一种锡做的玩意儿，带着撬牡蛎刀的是威尔士亲王，嗯这种事儿不可能是真的，就像是他给我带回来的那些书一样，弗朗索瓦某某先生的作品，据说还是一位神父呢，写的是一个女人脱了肠，所以娃娃就从她耳朵里生下来啦，说什么她的a—e，这个词儿随便由哪个神父来写都够雅的了，真好像任何傻子都弄不懂那个字的含义似的，我就恨他那种老恶棍的脸，对什么都装糊涂，谁都看得出这不是真实的，还有他替我借回两遍的鲁碧和美丽的暴君们记得当我读到第五十页的时候，有一段写她用绳子捆住他并悬挂在钩子上，而且拿鞭子抽打，对女人来说这样的故事一点儿看头都没有，统统是瞎编的，还说什么舞会后他把香槟酒盛在她那双便鞋里来饮，就像是我在英奇柯尔瞧见的那位马槽里的婴儿耶稣，圣母玛利亚把他抱在怀里，当然哪个女人也生不出那么大的娃娃起初我还以为是从她的侧腹生出来的，不然她怎么能蹲到尿盆上去解手呢，当然喽，她是个阔女人，感到荣幸，因为对方是皇太子殿下嘛，我出生的那一年他到直布罗陀来啦，我敢担保他在那儿也找到了百合花，他还在那儿栽树来着，当年他栽的还不止那一棵，要是他来得早一些，也许还把我也给栽了呢，那么我就不会像现在这样待在这儿啦，他应该退出那个自由人报，他只能捞上可怜巴巴的几个先令，应该到办事处什么的当差去，在那儿领一份固定的工钱，要么就到银行去他们就会让他坐上宝座，成天数钞票，当然喽，他宁愿在家里悠悠荡荡地混日子他要是待在你身旁，会弄得你简直动弹不得，他还问着，你今儿都演出些什么节目呀，我甚至巴不得他能像我爹那样叼上只烟斗，发散出男子汉的气味，要么就到处荡来荡去，假装是在拉广告，他要不是干了那么一件事，本来是蛮可以还在卡夫先生手下工作的后来他又派我去想法儿说情，我原是能够让他被提升做那儿的管理人的，他赏脸接见了我一两次，起初他口气强硬得让人没法儿接近，说什么布卢姆太太，千真万确，可我身上那件过了时的蹩脚衣服弄得我难堪透了，下摆上的铅锤丝脱落了，整个走了样儿，不过近来又流行起这种式样来了，我纯粹是为了让他高兴才买这件衣裳的，从做工就看得出它不行，可惜我没按照原先说过的那样到托德和勃恩斯去，却改变了主意，去利斯啦，这身衣裳就跟那家店一个样，廉价出售一大批粗制滥造的处理品，我就恨那些阔铺子，真叫人讨厌，无论什么衣服穿在我身上都分外显眼，不过他认为于女人的服装和烹调他知道得很多，对什么事都婆婆妈妈的，我要是听他摆布，就得把架子上的作料一股脑儿都扫进去，无论我戴哪一顶帽子，只要问他这我戴着合适吗，行啊，就戴这顶吧，挺好，那就像生日蛋糕似的，在我头上竖了起来，足有好几英里高，他却说我戴着蛮合适，要么就像一顶罩盘布一般耷拉到我背后，他也说好，我把他带到格拉夫顿街那家店去算是倒了霉，他对女店员直赔小心，说什么我恐怕太麻烦您啦，她露着假笑，要多傲慢有多傲慢，那不正是她该当干的吗，但是我狠狠地瞪了她一眼嗯，弄得他挺狼狈，倒也难怪，可第二回他就不一样了，他又成了平素那个像汤一样梗得要命的波尔迪，可是当他起身为我打开门的时候，我看得出他死命地盯着我的胸脯，不管怎样，他把我送出去，礼数总是周到的，实在抱歉，布卢姆太太请相信我，接着就含糊其词了，当他头一次遭到侮辱，我被错认作是他的老婆的时候，我只是微微一笑，我晓得，待在门口那当儿，我的奶头是露出来的，他正在说着，我非常抱歉，我相信你也是的。嗯，由于他嘬了好半晌，都给嘬得硬邦些了，他弄得我口里干渴，他管它们叫作小咂咂儿，我忍不住笑了起来，嗯，反正这边儿这只硬邦啦，只要稍微有点儿什么奶头就硬啦，我要让他老是这么嘬下去，我要把搅出沫儿来的鸡蛋掺到马沙拉里来喝，为了他的缘故，把奶头养得肥肥实实的，那些血管唔的是干吗的呢，两个造得一模一样，多奇妙啊，倘若生了一对双胞胎的话，它们会被认为是美的象征，就那样摆在那儿，像是陈列馆里的雕像似的，雕像中的一座还假装用她的一只手遮住它，它们真那么美吗，当然喽，要是跟男人那副样子比起来的话，他的两只袋装得满满的，他那另一个物儿又耷拉出来，要么就像帽架上的钩子那么朝你戳过来，也难怪他们要用一片白菜叶子遮住它哩，那个讨厌的金马伦高原士兵躲在肉市背后，要么就是另外那个红头发坏蛋，藏在树后边，那儿曾经立着一座鱼儿的雕像，当我打那儿经过的时候，他就假装在撤尿，掀开娃娃布，把那物儿竖起来给我看，这帮女王近卫军真够呛，亏得后来萨里军替换了他们，他们总想掏出那物儿显摆给你看，几乎每一回我试着从哈考特街车站附近的公共男厕所外面经过，总看见这个或那个家伙正试图引起我的注意，就好像那物儿是世界七大奇迹中的一件似的，哦，那些烂地儿的臭气就甭提啦，有一天晚上参加科默福德夫妇的宴会，跟波尔迪一道回家的路上，可口的橘子和柠檬汽水使得我想撒尿了，就进了一间厕所天气冷得刺骨，我简直憋不住啦，那是什么时候来着，是九三年，当时运河已经结了冰，嗯，金马伦高原士兵已调走了几个月，可惜他们当中的个把人没能待在那儿瞧着我蹲在男厕所的小便池上，从前我试着画过一幅那物儿的图，像是根香肠唔的，我又给撕碎了，我倒想知道，他们走来走去的，难道不怕在那个部位被踢上一脚或咚地挨一下打吗，女人当然意味着美，谁都知道这一点，当我们住在霍利斯街的时候，他被希利那家店解雇啦，我靠卖衣服，并且在咖啡宫胡乱弹奏过活，他说我蛮可以替什么阔佬当裸体模特儿，我要是把头发披散下来，就会像那个出水的宁芙吗，只不过她更年轻一些罢了，要么我就有点儿像是他收藏的那张西班牙相片上的烂婊子，我曾问过他，难道宁芙就老是那么着四处走动吗我还问他，碰上了里面有着胶皮管的什么玩意儿那个词儿，他却搬出那个关于化身的绕口令，他永远也不会把一件事解释得简单一些，好让人家明白，接着他又去把锅底儿都给烧坏啦，而这又全都是为了煎他那份腰子，这边儿的倒还没什么，他总想咬住那边儿的奶头，还留着牙印儿哪，我忍不住喊起来了，他们多可怕呀，老是想伤害你，生米莉那回我的奶水真足，够喂两个娃娃的啦，那到底是怎么回事呢，他说什么我要是去给人家当奶妈，每星期能挣上一英镑哩，一到早晨简直就胀得鼓鼓的，溢出来啦，寄住在二十八号的西特伦家那个看上去挺文弱的学生彭罗斯隔着窗户差点儿瞅见我正在那儿洗呢，不过我赶紧抓条毛巾蒙住了脸，这就是他用的功喽，让她断奶的时候，它们可让我受够了罪，直到他请布雷迪大夫给我开一副颠茄药才算了结，我只好叫他替我嘬一嘬，他说它们硬得很，可是比母牛的还甜还浓哪，后来他想要我把奶水挤到茶里去，他可真能胡来，我敢说应该有人把他写到新闻专栏里去，我要是能记住种种事情的一半儿的话就能写成一本书，就叫它作波尔迪公子作品集吧，嗯，这边儿的皮肤变得光滑多啦，他足足嘬了它们一个多钟头，没错儿我看钟来着，我就像是有了个大娃娃似的，他们什么都往嘴里塞，这些男人总要从女人身上得到一切快乐，直到现在我还在感受着他那嘴巴的嘬劲儿，哦，天哪，我可得把身子摊开来，我巴不得他在这儿，要么就是旁的什么人，好叫我那么一遍又一遍地丢啊丢的，我觉得身子里面全是火，或者要是我能梦见当时他是怎么第二遍使我丢的就好了，他从后面用手指挠着我，我把两条腿盘在他身上，一连丢了有五分钟，事后我禁不住紧紧搂住他，噢天哪，我恨不得大声喊出各种话来，操吧，拉屎啦，或随便说点儿什么，可就是别露出一副丑相，耗尽了精力，脸上布满皱纹，谁晓得他心里是怎么想的呢，你可得琢磨男人的心情，谢天谢地，男人们并不都像他这样，有的人喜欢女人在搞的时候斯斯文文的，我注意到了他们的差别，他搞的时候一声不吭，我抬起眼睛那样看着他，颠鸾倒凤，头发有点儿乱啦，我从嘴唇里吐出舌头朝这个野蛮畜生伸了过去星期四，星期五，一天，星期六，两天，星期日，三天，哦，老天爷，我哪里等得到星期一呢">查看中文翻译</div>

fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderillos with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didn't get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled up under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never come back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the swell of the ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only Captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I supposed he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriments on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holies street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to him who did I get the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now whatever possessed her to write after so many years to

used to write to the fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipit precipitancy with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very fine for them but as for being a

<div class="line_en">Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the Vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the Blackwater but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open at the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldn't let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhereyesbecausetheyoncetooksomething down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never get far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there all the time so tender how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat I had a skirt opening up the side I tortured the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssst awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that morning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went around to the what you call it everything was what you call it moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a Captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burial place pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peaked cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Willis road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with Captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche Paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly Darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to South Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with

<div class="line_en">that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us Goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Illget a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Illget a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drive out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatmen he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me to pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on you vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats I consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with bis tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to go get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Illhave to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all die lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day you never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly News 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time I11 ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylish dressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didn't remember me and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the iron-mould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her I11 have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose I11 have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him Drim-mies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soulthats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think I11 cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow I11 have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like

title="这下子可松快啦，无论你待在哪里，放屁尽随你的意，难道是干完了之后我就着一杯茶吃下去的猪排在作怪吗，由于天气热不怎么新鲜了吧，我倒是一点儿也没闻出什么来，我敢说猪肉铺那个长得古里古怪的家伙是个大骗子，我希望那盏灯没冒烟儿，那会叫我的鼻子堵满煤烟子，可也总比他整宵点着煤气灯强，在直布罗陀的时候我躺在床上总是睡不消停，就是得爬起来瞧个分明，关于这一点，我怎么会敏感得这么历害呢，不过一到冬天，我就喜爱上它啦，觉得有个伴儿，哦老天爷，那年冬天可冷得邪乎，那时候我才十来岁，是吗，嗯，我有个大娃娃，一会儿把那些稀奇古怪的衣服都给它穿上，一会儿又一件件地扒下来，冰冷的风从山上飕飕地刮过来，什么内华达来着，希拉内华达，我穿着一小件短汗衫，站在炉火跟前，是爬起来取暖的，我就爱穿着汗衫满屋子跳舞，后来又飞快地跑回床上夏天的时候对面那所房子里那个家伙准是把灯熄啦，经常一直守在那儿，我呢，赤条条地跳来跳去，我常常喜欢站在脸盆架跟前，脱光了衣服轻轻地拍一拍，要么就抹点儿雪花膏，不过使用便器的时候我也总会把灯灭了，我们俩曾这么躺来着，这一夜我就甭打算睡啦，不管怎样，我希望他可别跟那帮医科学生打得火热，他们会教他走上邪路，让他以为自己又年轻起来啦，早晨四点钟才回家，准是四点要不是更晚的话，不过，他总算还懂得规矩，没把我吵醒，亏得他们能找到那么多话题，絮絮叨叨居然聊上一宵，乱花钱，喝得越来越醉，难道他们就不能喝白水吗然后他就对咱点起菜来啦，要吃鸡蛋喝茶，还要芬顿黑线鳕和烤得热热的面包抹黄油，我想他会像一国之王似的在床上欠起身来，倒提着调羹对着鸡蛋使劲儿地抡上抡下，这一套到底是从哪儿学来的呢，我就爱听他早晨端着托盘，那一个个杯子咯嗒咯嗒响成一片，跌跌撞撞地爬上楼梯，还有他逗猫的声音，猫儿是为了图自个儿舒坦才往你身上蹭啊蹭的，不晓得它身上长没长跳蚤，猫儿简直跟女人一样坏，老是舔啊舔的都给弄湿啦，可我讨厌它们那爪子，我倒想知道它们是不是能瞧见咱们瞧不见的东西呢，它总是在楼梯顶儿上一坐就是好长时间，瞪大了眼睛听着，而我还在等着它呢，一向总是这样的，可它又是能干的强盗，偷了我买的那条漂亮新鲜的比目鱼，我想明天买点儿鱼，要么今天就去买，是星期五吧，对啦，就这么着吧，添上点儿牛奶冻，加上乌梅果酱，像老早以前那样，那种李子苹果混合的两磅重的果酱罐头可不行，就是从伦敦和纽卡斯尔的威廉斯—伍兹那家店买的，能保存一倍时间，只因为有骨头，我就讨厌那些鳝鱼，鳕鱼，嗯，我要去买一段新鲜鳕鱼，我总是买够三个人吃的，净忘记，反正我对巴克利肉店那一成不变的肉已经感到腻味啦，牛肋肉和腿肉，牛排和羊脖子和小牛内脏，只要一听这名儿就够啦，要不要组织一次郊游呢，假定我们大家每人摊五先令，或者叫他出钱，还为他请上另外什么女人，请谁呢，弗莱明大妈吧，我们坐马车到荆豆谷或草莓园去，先得叫他把所有的马蹄铁都检查一遍，就像他检查信件一样，不，可别请博伊兰到那儿去啦，嗯，带上些夹着冷小牛肉和火腿的什锦三明治，那儿的河堤脚下特地盖起了一座座小房子，但是他说那简直热得像火焰一样，反正银行假日可出不得门，我就讨厌杂耍演员那样打扮的俗气娘儿们赶在这一天成群地拥来，圣灵降临节的第二天也是个倒霉的日子，难怪蜜蜂要蜇他哪，还是到海边儿去的好，可是我这辈子再也不跟他一块儿坐船啦，上回跟着他去了一趟布莱，他对船老大说，他会划船，要是有人问他能不能参加获得金质奖杯的越野赛马，他也会说，能呀，然后海上起了风浪，那个老掉了牙的家伙就七扭八歪起来，分量整个偏到我这边儿来啦，忽而要我把身子往右边儿靠，忽而又要我朝左边儿靠，潮水从船底儿上哗啦哗啦往里灌，他划着的桨也从链子上脱落下来啦，亏得我们还没统统淹死，他当然会游泳喽，我可不会，他穿了条法兰绒长裤，说是啥危险也没有，要我放镇静点儿，我恨不得当着所有人的面儿，把那条裤子从他身上扒下来，撕个稀巴烂，给他一顿常说的鞭刑，打得他浑身又黑又蓝，这对他好处可大着哪，可惜我不认识那个鼻子挺长的家伙，还带了个美人儿，从市徽饭店来的伯克照例待在码头上，四下里偷看着，他总是跑到用不着他去的地方，想瞧瞧有没有打架的，要是给啐上一口，那脸蛋儿也许会变得好看一些哩，我们俩已经没有爱情啦，早就消失啦，这总算是个安慰，他给我带回来的是本什么书呢，偷情的快乐，是位时髦绅士写的，还有一个德科克先生，我猜想他总是带着他的管子挨着个儿找女人，大家才给他取了这么个外号，我甚至没能换一下我那双崭新的白鞋，完全给咸水泡坏啦，我戴的那顶插着羽毛的帽子整个被风吹得翘了起来，在我头上摆来摆去，多么让人厌烦冒火啊，一闻海水的气味我就兴奋起来啦，当然喽，卡塔兰湾的沙丁鱼啦，大头鱼啦，在岩石后面那一带，它们可好看哩，在渔夫的篓子里统统发着银光，他们说老鲁依吉眼看就一百岁啦，是从热那亚来的，还有那个戴着耳环的高个子老头儿，我可不喜欢那种你非爬上去才够得着的男人，我猜想那号人老早就死光啦，而且烂掉啦，再说我绝不愿意晚上一个人待在这个兵营般的地方，我看也只好凑合呗，我们刚搬来的时候，一片混乱，我甚至忘记带点儿盐来，他打算在二楼的客厅开所音乐学校，还挂起一块黄铜招牌，他还提议经营起一家布卢姆私人旅馆，那样一来就会像他爹在恩尼斯那样，把自己毁掉拉倒，就跟他对爹说的所有那些他要做的事情一样，对我也是这么说的可我已经把他看穿啦，他还对我说过我们能够去度蜜月的一切可爱的地方，月光下在威尼斯划着贡多拉，他还有一张科莫湖的剪报，又是什么曼陀林啦，灯笼啦，哦，我说，可好啦，无论我喜欢什么，他都马上着手去办，要多快有多快，你要做我的丈夫吗，你肯替我拎罐儿吗，就凭他所编造的种种计划，也该奖给他一枚镶着油灰边的皮质微功勋章，把咱成天价撇在这儿，你万万想不到站在门口乞讨面包皮并且啰哩啰唆诉说身世的老叫化子，兴许就是个流浪汉，他伸过一只脚来让我关不上门，就像劳埃德新闻周刊上登过照片的那个老惯犯似的，他坐了二十年的牢，刚一放出来就又图财谋害了一位老太太，替他那可怜的老婆妈妈或家里旁的女人想想吧，冲他那个长相你见了就得一溜烟儿跑开好几英里，不把所有的门窗都牢牢地上了闩我是不能安心睡下的，可这下子就更糟啦，简直像是关在监狱或疯人院里似的，应该把那些家伙一股脑儿给枪毙掉，要么就用九尾鞭来抽打，这么一个大块头畜生居然去向一位可怜的老太太动手，把她残杀在床上，要是我的话，就把他那物儿割下来，非这么做不可，他这个人顶不了多大事儿，不过总比没有强，那天晚上我肯定听见厨房里进了一帮贼，他只穿着件衬衫就下楼去啦，手里拿着蜡烛和拨火棍儿，就像是去逮老鼠似的，魂儿都吓掉啦，脸色煞白，做出的声音要多大有多大，那帮贼倒是得了济哩，天晓得，家里其实没多少可偷的，不过，尤其是因为如今米莉也走啦，那滋味儿不好受，由于他爷爷的那点因缘，他竟心血来潮，打发闺女到那儿去学照相啦，可没把她送到斯克利斯学院去念书，她不像我，她在国立学校的时候，可门门都考头一名哩，不过，由于我和博伊兰的缘故他不得不做那样一档子事儿，正因为如此，他才这么做的，对于他怎样设计和策划一切，我心里是一清二楚的，近来只要她在家，除非先把门上了闩，我简直连动也不能动，她从来也不先敲一下门就闯进来，弄得我总是提心吊胆，得先用椅子把门顶住，才能戴上手套洗下身，这样会使，神经受刺激的，要么就让她成天像个木头小姐似的，干脆把她装在玻璃匣子里，我们俩一道看着她好啦，她离开家以前由于笨手笨脚，大大咧咧，竟把那座中看不中用的小雕像的手给弄断啦，我花上两先令才让那个意大利小男孩给修理好的，如今一点儿也看不出接缝儿来啦，要是给他知道了呢，她甚至不肯替你把煮土豆的水倒掉，当然喽，她也是对的，省得把手弄粗啦，我留意近来他在饭桌上老是跟她讲这讲那，讲解着报纸上的事情，她呢，就假装听懂啦，当然挺狡猾啦，这可是从他那边的血统来的，还帮助她穿上大衣，可她要是觉得哪儿不舒服就会告诉我，而不告诉他，他不能说我装模作样，他能吗，我的确太老实啦，我估摸着他以为我已经没戏啦，再也不会有人理睬啦，喔我才不会呢，不，绝不会那样，喔，等着瞧吧，喔，等着瞧吧，如今晚儿她也和汤姆德万的两个儿子调起情来啦，都是跟我学的，还跟来喊她的默里家的野丫头们一道吹口哨，米莉，请你出来吧，她红得很哪，大家都尽量地向她打听这打听那，天都黑啦，还在纳尔逊街骑着哈里德万斯的自行车兜圈子，他把她送到现在这个地方去也有好处，她刚巧变得约束不住了，老想去溜冰场，跟大伙儿一起从鼻孔里喷出纸烟圈儿，当我替她在上衣下摆上钉纽扣儿，把线咬断的时候，从她衣服上闻出气味来啦，她什么也瞒不住我，真的，只怪我不该在她还穿在身上的时候就替她缝，这会造成离别的，而且前一回做的李子布丁竟裂成两瓣儿啦，不管人家怎么说，瞧，这不就应验了吗，从我的趣味来说，她未免太爱饶舌啦，她对我说，你这件衬衫的脖领儿开得太低啦，这就好比是锅对壶说，你的底儿太黑啦，我还得告诉她，可不要当着一个个行人的面儿，把你的两条腿那么显眼地在窗台上跷着，人家全都在瞧着她，就像瞧我一样，当然喽，我指的是我在她这个年龄的时候想当年，无论穿什么旧衣烂衫都显眼，在皇家剧院看唯一的路那回，她傲慢地摆出一副谁也不许碰我的架势，说什么把你的脚闪开，我就讨厌人家碰我，她怕得要死，唯恐我会把她那条百褶裙给压坏啦，在剧院里黑咕隆咚的，趁着拥挤可没少碰碰撞撞的，那帮家伙总是想方设法扭到你跟前儿来，上回我们在欢乐剧场后座站着看比尔博姆特里公演软毡帽的时候，就有那么一个该下地狱的家伙，不管是为软毡帽也罢，或者为她的屁股也罢，反正我再也不到那儿去给人挤来挤去啦，每隔两分钟那家伙就戳我那个部位一下，然后朝一旁望去，我认为他有点儿半吊子，后来我又见过他，正在想法儿靠近待在斯威策的橱窗外面那两位衣着时髦的太太呢，好耍他那套花招儿，从他那副长相和旁的一切，我马上就认出他来他可不记得我啦，在布罗德斯通临动身的时候，她甚至于不愿意我跟她亲一下嘴儿，喔，我希望她会找到个对她献殷勤的人，就像我当年那样，她得了流行性腮腺炎，那些腺都肿胀起来，病倒了的当儿总是问这问那，当然她还不能有什么深的感触，我约莫二十二岁以前从来也没正正经经搞过，老是弄错了地方，只不过是女孩儿家通常那种瞎胡闹，吃吃地傻笑罢咧，一个叫科尼康诺利的，曾经在黑纸上用白墨水给我写了一封信，还涂上火漆封了印，不过落幕的时候她鼓了掌，因为他看上去那么英俊，接着，马丁哈维就每天三顿饭都到我们家来吃啦，后来我暗地里想，要是一个男人什么也不图，就那么为了她而送掉自个儿的命，那必定就是真正的爱情啦，这样的男人恐怕剩不下几个啦，不过这是难以相信的，除非这种事儿确实发生在我身上，大多数男人生来一丁点儿爱情也没有，如今晚儿到哪儿去找像你们两个这样心心相印的，样样都想到一块儿去啦，这种人通常就是脑袋瓜儿有点儿笨，他爹准就有点儿怪，所以她死了以后，他跟着也服毒自杀啦，但是好可怜的老人家啊，我估计他没着落啦，她一直喜欢我的东西，十五岁的时候就想用我的旧布条把头发扎起来，还要搽我的粉哪，只不过会弄粗她的皮肤，她这辈子还有的是时间去打扮呢，她知道自己长得俊，嘴唇儿那么红，可惜不会老是这样我当年不也是那样的吗，可是把这丫头带到集市上去也是白搭，当我叫她去买半斯通土豆的时候，她回答我的口气活像个渔婆儿，那天我们在小马驾车赛上碰见了乔加拉赫太太，她跟律师弗赖尔利一道坐在她那辆双轮轻便马车里，居然假装没瞧见我们，因为我们不够气派的呗，后来我狠狠地给了她两个大耳刮子，一巴掌是因为你回嘴，另一巴掌是因为你没规矩，当然是她这样顶撞惹我生的气，可我本来就在气头上，因为茶里不知怎么进了一根野草，要么就是由于吃下去的奶酪不对头，夜里没睡好觉，而且我对她说过多少遍，别把刀子交叉着放，因为正像她自己说的，谁都不能指挥她，喔，假若他不管教她，就得由我来管啦，那是她最后一回哭鼻子，当年我自个儿也是那样，没人敢叫我做这做那，没有老早就雇个女人，却让我们两个当牛做马，这当然是他的过错喽，什么时候我才能再有个像样儿的女仆呢，当然喽，那么一来他就会动手动脚的啦，我得让她知道一下，不过，这下子兴许她会报复哩，她们真够讨厌的，那个弗莱明老大娘你就得跟在她后面转悠，往她手里放这放那，她净打喷嚏，要么就往尿盆里放屁喔，她老啦，当然管不住自己喽，幸亏我从厨桌后面找到了那块丢失了的旧抹布又脏又臭，我就知道有点儿什么玩意儿，打开窗户，放一放气味，他把朋友们带回来款待，就拿那天晚上来说吧，居然领着条狗走回家来啦，你看多奇怪，没准儿还是条疯狗哪，尤其是西蒙迪达勒斯的儿子，他爹什么事都挑剔得很，看板球比赛的时候，他举着望远镜，戴着大礼帽，短袜上可破了个大窟窿，真叫人恶心，他儿子在期中考试时门门功课都得了奖，想想看，他竟然从栏杆上爬了过来，要是给我们的熟人瞧见了可怎么好，他那条送葬时才穿的讲究的长裤会不会给刮破个大口子呢，就好像生下来就有的窟窿还不够似的，居然把他领进又脏又旧的厨房里，他的脑袋瓜儿难道有毛病了吗，可惜这不是洗衣裳的日子，我那条旧衬裤也许还搭在绳子上给大伙儿看哪，可他呢，一点儿也不在乎那个笨婆子还给烫煳了一块，说不定他会以为是别的什么东西呢，她甚至也没按照我吩咐她的那样把油渍去掉，如今她也就这么下去了，因为她那个中了风的丈夫越来越糟啦，他们总是在闹着什么毛病，不是生病就是开刀，不然的话他就酗酒，动手揍她，我又得到处去寻摸个什么人啦，每天我一起床就总有点儿新鲜事儿，天哪，天哪，喏，我料想等我抻了腿儿，躺在坟地里，才能安安神儿，我想起来一下，也许尿出来啦，等一等哦，老天爷，等一等，对啦，我身上来了那玩意儿啦，对啦，这不让你受罪吗，敢情都是由于他在我里头戳来戳去，连根儿都给耕到啦，如今我可怎么办呢，星期五，星期六，星期日，那会把人给折磨得魂儿都出壳儿啦，除非他喜欢这手，有的男人就喜欢，咱们女人家总是不那么顺当，每隔三四个星期就得来一回月经，一拖就是五天，那天晚上我身上就来了，真是讨厌透啦，迈克尔冈恩前前后后就请我们在欢乐剧场的包厢里看过一回肯德尔夫人和她丈夫，他在德里米的时候曾经为人寿保险的事儿替他出过点儿力，我只得用带子扎住，可那位衣着时髦的绅士从上面直用望远镜盯着我，而他呢坐在我另一边，大谈什么斯宾诺莎啦还有他那我猜想几百万年前就死掉了的灵魂啦，我简直就像是陷进了沼泽里似的可我还是尽量露着笑容，仿佛挺感兴趣一般向前探着身子，总得一直坐到听完最后的收场白呀，斯卡里的那个妻子我可是不会轻易忘掉的，顶层楼座的那个白痴把它看成是一出关于通奸的淫戏啦，就朝着那个女人嘘了起来，喊她做淫妇，散戏之后，我猜想他准会到旁边那条巷子去找个女人，沿着所有那些偏僻的小路追来追去，让她做出补偿，但愿被他逮住的是跟当时的我同样状况的女人，那他就活该啦，我敢打赌，连那猫儿都比我们强，难道女人身子里的血太多啦还是咋的，哦憋不住啦，它就像海水似的从我身子里冒了出来，不管怎样，尽管他的那么大，却没使我怀上孕，我不愿意把那些干净褥单糟蹋了，这都是我穿上件干净的亚麻衬衫招来的，该死，该死，他们总是想看到床上的血印儿，好知道你是个处女，他们个个对这一点老是放心不下，他们都是些大傻瓜，哪怕你是个寡妇或者离过四十次婚，只要胡乱涂上点儿红墨水不就行啦，要么就是黑莓汁子，不，那又太紫糊糊的啦，老天爷，请救我一把，摆脱这种事儿吧，呸，偷情的快乐，究竟是谁替女人想到这么一档子事儿的呢，并且把它穿插到缝衣做饭养育孩子当中去，这张该死的旧床丁零当啷乱响，真是的，我猜他们从公园的那一头都能听见我们啦，后来我想出了个主意，把鸭绒被铺在地板上，我屁股底下垫个枕头，白天干是不是更有趣儿呢，我倒觉得挺自在的，我想把这些毛毛儿全铰掉，刺挠得慌，兴许看上去会像个年轻姑娘哩，下回他把我的衣服撩起来，会不会觉得上了大当呢，只要能看到他那张脸蛋儿，让我干什么都可以，尿盆儿哪儿去啦，慢慢儿地，自从那个旧便器坏掉以后，我总是生怕把这个压碎，我觉得坐在他腿上也许太重啦，所以故意让他坐在圈儿椅上，这当儿我先在另一间屋里脱下罩衫和裙子，还不到点子上他就忙乎开啦，他从来也没好好儿摸过我，我预先吃了吻香糖，但愿我的气儿是甜丝丝的，慢慢儿地，天哪，记得当年我几乎能够像男人那么直直地哗哗地撒出来，哦老天爷，多响啊，我希望上面起泡儿，那样一来就能从什么人手里弄到一大笔钱可别忘了早晨我还得往尿里撒上点儿香料，我敢打赌，他从来也没见过这么漂亮的一双大腿，瞧，它们有多白啊，顶光滑的就是当中间儿这一小块地方，多嫩哇，就像一只桃子似的，慢慢儿地，我倒想当个男人，跨在一个漂亮女孩儿身上，你做出的声音多大啊，就像是泽西百合，慢慢儿地，慢慢儿地，哦，水是怎样从拉合尔冲下来的">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides there something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriment I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he puts it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 or 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being Jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very ist opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day Id better not make an all night sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in bis wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond Terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holies street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thorns and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the Freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait 2 oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him off that little habit Illknock him off that little habit tomorrow first Illlook at his shirt to see or Illsee if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holies street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that we then I dont I11 make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top on his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Bloom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earnsdown their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for Viim what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holies street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell dArcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats n years ago now yes hed be n though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor die other of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a Journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 881 suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuck up university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and taking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a patent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the night-boat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I never go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid I11 sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathing place from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simply I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looked with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age I11 throw them the ist thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or I11 try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out I11 read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part I11 make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="难道我身子里头有什么毛病了吗，要么就是长了什么东西，所以每星期都排泄出那样的玩意儿，上回我身上是什么时候来的呢，圣灵降临节的第二天，对啦，才过了三个来星期，我得去瞧瞧大夫，也不过是像我跟他结婚以前那一次罢咧，当时我有白带，弗洛伊教我去找彭布罗克路的那个干巴巴木头木脑的老妇科大夫科林斯给瞧瞧，他管那个叫你的阴道，我猜想他就是靠这套手法，从斯蒂芬草地一带的阔主儿身上弄到一面面框上镀了金字的镜子和一块块地毯的，她们只要有一星半点儿的小毛病就跑来找他，她的阴道啦，她的小腿象皮病啦，她们有的是钱喽，所以她们什么都好，即便世界上只剩下了他这么一个男人，我也不会嫁给他，再说，那些女人的娃娃们老是有点儿不舒服，经常对着那些臭婊子闻来闻去，居然还问起我那白带有没有讨厌的气味，他究竟想让我干什么呀，唯一想要的也许是金钱呗，哪里有提这种问题的，要是我怀着全部敬意，把那玩意儿统统抹遍了他那张满是皱纹的老脸孔上，我猜想他就准会明白啦，他还问我，你那个容易通吗，通什么呀，听他那口气，我还以为他指的是直布罗陀岩石呢，这倒也是个非常巧妙的发明，说起来，我就喜欢事后把下身尽量挤进到马桶的坑里，接着拉一下链子，冲洗一番，又舒坦又凉爽，简直都发麻啦，可我总觉得身子里面还留着点儿什么，米莉小的时候，我常检查她排泄出来的，好知道她有没有虫子，不管怎么着，照样得付钱给他，大夫，多少钱啊，请交一畿尼，他居然问起我，遗漏出来的多不多，这些老家伙是打哪儿弄到这些词儿的呢，边说什么它们遗漏出来，边斜愣着那双近视眼，朝我使眼色，我不大信任他，绝不让他给我施麻醉剂，或者天晓得还有什么旁的玩意儿，可我还是喜欢他坐下来写那东西时候的样儿，绷着脸皱起眉头，鼻子显得挺聪明的，好像在说，你这混蛋，你这瞎话流星的轻佻娘儿们，哦随你爱怎么说就怎么说吧，没关系，只要别说是白痴就成，他也够聪明的，看出了这一点，当然喽，他绞尽脑汁才给我写了一封封狂热痴情的信，我的宝贝儿，什么都离不开你那光辉的玉体，还在一切这个字下面画了线，都永远是美好的，给人快乐的，这些都是他从手头一本无聊的书里抄下来的，我自个儿有时候一天要搞四五回，可我说我没搞，真的吗，啊，嗯，我说这一点儿不假，这么一来他就不吭声啦，我晓得底下会怎么样，这不过是娘胎里带来的弱点罢咧，我们头回见面的那个晚上，也不知道怎样一来，他就教我兴奋起来啦，当时我住在里霍勃斯高台街我们站着，直勾勾地相互盯着看了十来分钟，就好像在哪儿见过似的，我猜想那是由于我赶母亲，有着犹太女人的容貌，他脸上露着有点儿懒散的微笑，常常东拉西扯地哄我开心，多伊尔一家人全都说他会竞选下议院议员，噢，我可是个地地道道的傻瓜，居然把他关于自治运动和土地同盟吹的那些牛皮都当真啦，他还把胡格诺派教徒里那首又长又乱的歌儿给我送了来，说是用法国话唱就更古雅哦，德拉图赖讷的美丽国土，这支歌儿我连一回也没唱过，他又大讲起宗教和迫害来啦，乱七八糟的，什么事儿他总也不教你自自然然地享受一番，然后他就像是对你开个大恩似的，在布赖顿广场逮住头一个机会就赶紧跑进我的卧室来了假装手上沾了墨水，要用我经常使的含着阿尔比安奶和硫黄的肥皂，可那肥皂还裹着包装的蜡纸呢，哦，那天我直笑他，简直笑破了肚皮，我还是别整宿坐在这玩意儿上头啦，他们应该按照普通的尺寸来造尿盆儿，女人家也就能够舒舒服服地坐在上面啦，他竟然跪下去解手，我估摸着天底下再也找不到第二个男人有他这种习惯的啦，瞧他在床脚那个睡法儿，连个硬枕头都没有，怎么能睡呢，亏得他倒不踢踢踹踹的，不然的话，我满嘴牙都会被他踢掉啦，一只手摁着鼻子呼吸，活脱儿像那位印度神，一个下雨的星期天，他领我到基尔代尔街博物馆去让我看过，浑身裹了件长坎肩儿，侧着躺在手上，十个脚趾挓挲开来，他说，那个宗教比犹太教和咱们天主教加在一块儿还大呢，整个亚洲都在模仿他，正像他总在模仿每一个人，我猜想他也一向都睡在床脚那一头，还把他那双大方脚丫子伸到他老婆嘴里去，这腥臭的劳什子，不管怎样，那些布片儿哪儿去啦，啊，对啦，我知道啦，但愿那只旧衣橱可别吱吱嘎嘎地响，啊，我就知道它会响的，他睡得好香啊，准是在什么地方寻欢作乐来着，不过，她给予他的倒也完全值得他出这笔钱，他当然得在她身上花钱喽，噢，这劳什子真讨厌，我巴不得下辈子我们女人能过得自在一点儿，别再这么把自己捆绑起来，老天爷，可怜可怜我们吧，这一宿这样就能对付啦这张老掉了牙丁零当啷响的笨床，总是教我想起老科恩，我猜他躺在这床上可没少挠自个儿，他呢，却还以为爹是从我还是个小妞儿的时候就曾经崇拜过的那个内皮尔勋爵手里买下的呢，因为我就是这么告诉他的，慢慢儿地，轻轻儿地哦，我爱我这张床，天哪，如今都十六年啦，我们这份日子过得还是跟以前一样紧巴巴的，我们统共搬过多少回家呀，隆巴德高台街跟翁塔利奥高台街跟伦巴德街跟霍利斯街，每回他都吊儿郎当地吹着口哨，不是胡格诺教徒这个曲子就是青蛙进行曲，还装模作样儿地帮那些脚夫去搬运我们那四样简陋的家具呢，后来又住进了市徽饭店，连看门的戴利都说是越来越差啦，总有人待在楼梯平台那儿的可爱的地方祷告，把他们的臭气全留下来啦，一闻就知道在你之前进去的是谁，每回刚刚顺当了，就又会出点儿什么事，要么就是他惹出什么麻烦来，汤姆也罢，希利也罢，卡夫先生也罢，德里米也罢，要么就是为了那些旧彩票的事儿差点儿蹲监狱，本来还指望全家人都靠它来得济哪，不然的话，他也会因为态度狂妄，很快就把自由人报这个饭碗给砸啦，就像旁的那几个差事一样，都是由于罪人芬或是共济会的缘故，那么就瞧瞧他指给咱看的那个下雨天淋得浸湿独自在科迪巷转悠的小个儿到底会给他多大安慰吧，他说那个人非常能干，浑身是纯粹的爱尔兰劲儿，从我看到的他身上那条长裤的纯粹劲儿来判断，他的确是这样的，慢乔治教堂的钟声响啦，慢，两点过三刻啦，深更半夜的，他真是挑了个好时候回的家，凑到人家跟前儿来啦，而且是跨过栏杆跳到空地上的，要是给什么人撞见了呢，明天我就得狠狠地把他这个小毛病改一改，头一桩，查查他的衬衫，要么就翻看那个法国信是不是还在他的皮夹子里，依我看他还只当我蒙在鼓里呢，这些男人就喜欢捣鬼，他们就是有二十个兜儿，也装不下他们那些瞎话，即便是真话他们也不会相信，那么又何必去说呢，然后就蜷起身子往床上一倒，活像是有一回他给我捎来的贵族那本杰作里的娃娃，直好像我们在现实生活里见到的例子还不够似的，管他叫老贵族还是叫什么名字呢，何苦拿那些长着两个脑袋的缺腿儿娃娃的破相片来恶心你，这就是他们成天梦想着干的罪恶勾当，他们那空洞洞的脑袋瓜儿里，什么旁的也没有装，他们当中有一半人就欠吃慢性毒药啦，还得给他预备茶和两面都涂了黄油的烤面包片，要新下的蛋，我想我这个人已经不算数啦，在霍利斯街的时候，有一个晚上我不许他舔我，男人啊男人，在这一点上总是个暴君，他光着身子在地板上睡了半宿，就像是亲属死了以后犹太人所做的那样，一口早饭也不肯吃，一句话都不说，我觉得他就是想让我对他亲热亲热，我坚持够了以后就让他随意去干，他只想着自个儿乐和，搞得完全不对头，他的舌头可不够圆滚，要么就是我也闹不清是怎么回事，他忘记了那个，可我呢，一点儿都不，假若他本人不在乎，我就教他再搞上一遍，然后把他锁在煤窖里，让他跟蟑螂一块儿睡觉去，我倒是想知道哪个女人迷上了我甩掉的这个男人，难道就是乔西吗，他可是个天生的谎屁流儿，不，他永远不会有胆量去勾搭一个有夫之妇，所以他才让我跟博伊兰，至于她叫作她的丹尼斯的那个垂头丧气的可怜虫，他算个什么丈夫呢，嗯，他在跟什么小婊子打得火热，上回我跟他带上米莉去看学院里的运动会那个脑袋上扣了顶娃娃帽的霍恩布洛尔放我们从后门进去的，他竟然向走来走去执行裙子任务的那两个女人飞起眼儿来，起初我试着朝他眨巴眼，但是白搭，当然喽，他的钱都这么花掉啦，这全是帕狄迪格纳穆先生的葬礼造成的，嗯，博伊兰带来的报纸上说，葬礼还挺隆重，大家都很有派头，倒是该让他们瞧瞧真正的军官的葬礼，那才叫了不起呢，枪托子朝上的枪啦，蒙起来的吊鼓啦，死者宠爱的马披着黑纱走在后面，利布姆和汤姆克南，有一回那个酒桶般的小酒鬼不知在什么地方喝醉啦，一头栽到男厕所里，咬掉了自己的舌头，还有马丁坎宁翰和迪达勒斯爷儿俩，再就是范妮麦科伊的丈夫，她那脑袋白得像棵白菜，皮包骨，斗鸡眼儿还想唱我那些歌儿呢，那她可得重新投胎才成，她穿了件开领儿挺低的旧绿衣裳反正再也没有旁的法儿来吸引男人了，她那嗓门儿活像下雨天儿啪嚓啪嚓蹚水的声音，我现在把什么都看透啦，他们所说的什么友谊只不过是你杀我我杀你，然后一埋拉倒，可每个人家里还都有老婆和眷属哪，尤其是杰克鲍尔，把那个酒馆女招待包下来啦，当然喽，他老婆老是生着病，不是快要病倒啦，就是刚缓过来，他倒是个蛮英俊的男人哩，尽管鬓角儿已经有点儿灰白了，他们这帮人可真够呛，喔，只要我能做得到，他们就休想再把我丈夫抓在手里，背地里还拿他取笑，我全都知道，喔，这是因为他干那些愚蠢勾当的时候，还有足够的理智，不肯把自己挣下的每个便士都挥霍到他们肚子里去，他总还要照顾老婆和家眷嘛，简直是一帮废物点心，可怜的帕迪狄格纳穆也是这样，我有点儿替他感到难过，除非他上了保险要不他那老婆和五个娃娃可咋办哪，活脱儿是个逗乐儿的小陀螺，总是摞在哪家酒吧的旮旯儿里，要么老婆要么就是儿子等在那里，比尔贝利，请你回家去好不好寡妇的丧服也不能使她好看多少，可你要是长得漂亮，穿上丧服就格外显眼，啥人没去呢，他吗，对啦，他参加了格伦克里的午餐会，还有那下贱的桶音本多拉德为了当场演唱，头天晚上他到霍利斯街来借燕尾服，好歹把身子塞进衣裤，他那张宽大的娃娃脸上满是笑容，活像是挨足了揍的小孩儿屁股，他看上去活像一对呆睾丸，一点儿也不差，在舞台上想必丢尽了脸，想想看，花上五先令，坐在包厢里难道就是为了瞧他吗，西蒙迪达勒斯也是一样，他在台上总是醉醺醺的，先从第二段歌词唱起来，旧日恋情是新恋是他的一个拿手节目，他唱起山楂枝上的女郎来，那嗓音多么圆润啊，而且他还总爱调情，当我跟他在弗雷迪迈耶斯家里一块儿唱歌剧玛丽塔娜的时候，他的歌声又优美又豪放，菲比，最亲爱的，再见，宝贝儿，他总是这么唱，宝贝儿，不像巴特尔达西那样把它唱成宝婊儿，当然喽他生就一副好嗓子，一点儿也不做作，听了就像是冲个热腾腾的淋浴似的，教你整个沉浸在里面哦，玛丽塔娜，荒林的花儿，我们唱得很出色，对我的音域来说，就是变一下调，也还是高了点儿，那时候他已经跟梅古尔丁结婚啦，可那时他说的做的，都会把好事儿给破坏啦，如今他成了老光棍儿啦，他儿子到底是个什么样儿的人呢，他说，他是个作家，都快要当上大学里的意大利语教授啦还要教我呢，他把我的相片拿给他看，究竟安的是什么心呢，那一张照得不好，我应该穿件满是褶裥的衣裳就好啦，那就永远不会显得过时了，不过，在那张相片上我显得还是挺年轻，他是不是连相片带我这个人都送给他了呢，那也没关系，反正我见过他跟着他爹妈，坐马车到王桥车站去，当时我还穿着丧服，那是十一年前的事嘞，嗯，他要是活下来，就该十一岁啦，可是替这样一个对我们来说根本不算数的娃娃服丧，又有什么用呢，当然喽，是他非要服丧不可，我猜想就连那只猫要是死了，他也会的，如今他该已经长成个男子汉了吧，当年他可是个天真烂漫的男孩儿，一个惹人爱的小宝宝，穿的是方特勒罗伊小爵爷的套服一头鬈发，活像是位舞台上的王子，我在马特狄龙家看到他的时候，他也喜欢我来着我记得他们都喜欢我的，等一等，天哪，嗯，等一等，嗯，沉住气，今天早晨我洗纸牌占卜婚姻的时候，出现了个发色不深不浅的年轻陌生人，是从前见过的，我还只当指的是他呢，可他并不是个年轻小伙子，也不是个不熟悉的人，而且我的脸是掉过去的，第七张牌是什么来着，随后是象征一次陆地旅行的黑桃10，后来还有已经寄出来的一封信和一件丑闻，三张王后和方块8表示会出人头地，嗯，等一等，全都应验啦，两张红8代表新衣裳，瞧啊，我不是还梦见过什么吗，嗯，梦里出现了关于诗的什么，我希望他可别留着油乎乎的长头发，一直耷拉到眼睛里，要么就像红印第安人那样倒竖着，他们为什么要弄成那副样子到处转悠呢，只不过是让人对他们自个儿和他们的诗嘲笑罢咧，我还是个小妞儿的时候可喜欢诗啦，起初我还以为他是拜伦勋爵那样的诗人呢，其实他连一丁点儿诗人的素质也没有，我认为他可完全不一样，我不知道他是不是太年轻啦，他大约是，等一等，八八年，我是八八年结的婚，米莉昨天十五啦，八九年，那么他到底多大呢，在狄龙家那回才五六岁吧，那是约莫八八年的事，我猜想他已经二十要么二十出头啦，他要是二十三四岁的话，对他来说，我还不算太老，我但愿他不是那种自以为了不起的大学生，不会的，不然的话，他也不会跟他一道坐在那间破旧的厨房里喝埃普斯可可啦，还聊着天儿，他当然假装统统都听懂啦，大概他还告诉他，自个儿是三一学院毕业的呢，作为教授他可太年轻啦，我希望他不是古德温那样的教授，论约翰詹姆森，他倒是个有权威的教授哩，他们全都在诗里写什么女人啦，喏，我认为他找不到多少像我这样的女人，那里有爱的微叹，吉他的轻弹，空气里弥漫着诗，蓝色的海洋和月亮闪闪发光，多么美丽，乘夜船从塔里法回来，欧罗巴岬角的灯台，那个人弹奏的吉他的旋律扣人心弦我会不会还有机会回到那儿去呢，一张张从来没见过的脸，窗格后藏着一双明媚的流盼，我要把这唱给他听，哪怕他有一星半点儿诗人的气质，也该能明白那就是我的眼睛，两只眼犹如爱星，乌黑又灿烂，年轻的爱心，词儿有多么美好哇，跟一个聪明人谈你自己，而不是老听他讲比利普雷斯科特的广告和凯斯的广告还有恶魔汤姆的广告，要是他们的生意出了什么毛病，咱们就得跟着受罪，我相信他准是个非常了不起的人，我就是想遇见这么个人，天哪，而不是旁的那些人渣子，而且他又那么年轻，从岩石旁边我可以瞧见下面马盖特海滨浴场的那些英俊小伙子，一个个赤条条地站在太阳底下，就像是神仙还是什么的，接着嗖的一下就跳到海里去了，为什么所有的男人不能都长成这样儿呢，那样的话，一个女人还能多少得到点儿安慰，就像他买的那座可爱的小雕像，我可以成天望着他，长长的鬈发，还有他那肩膀，为了让你注意去听而举起的指头，那才是为你的真正的美和诗哪，我常常感到恨不得把他浑身上下都吻遍了，包括他那招人爱的小鸡鸡儿多么淳朴，要是没人看着，我恨不得把它含在嘴里，它多么干净白皙呀，就像是祈求你嘬它似的，他仰起那张稚气的脸蛋儿望着你，我会这么做的，不出半分钟就完啦，哪怕我咽下了一丁点儿什么，那也没啥，只不过像是麦片粥或露水罢咧，不会有害处的，何况他还那么干净，比那帮猪一样的男人可强多啦，我猜想他们大部分人一年到头也绝不会想到要把那物儿洗上一洗，所以女人才会长出口髭来，在我这个岁数，要是能够交上一个年轻俊俏的诗人，那才神气哪，早晨我头一桩儿就出纸牌好看看那张愿望牌究竟会不会出来，要么我就给王后配对儿，看看他到底出不出来，凡是能找得到的，我都要读一读，学一学，还要背会一点儿，可也得等先晓得了他喜欢谁再说，这么一来，他就不至于嫌我愚蠢啦，假若他认为天下的女人都是一样的话，我倒得教他明白未必是这样的，我要把他弄得神魂颠倒，直到他在我底下差不多昏迷过去，然后他就写起我来啦，情人啦，情妇啦而且是公开地，当他出名以后，所有的报纸上都登出我们两人的照片，哦，可那时候我拿他咋办呢">查看中文翻译</div>

that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling upon you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the corner of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put die handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever I do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only to do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones old stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our ist death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who night-walkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vial plana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas andPisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum

down the two ways I always knew wed go away in lie end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados sefior Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres die room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks widi die fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like die one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Illjust give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see

Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know
