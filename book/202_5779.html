<div class="line_en">Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer's day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three o'clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as "Cousin Barny" and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天下午三点，哈利、罗恩、弗雷德、乔治站在果园里巨大的白色帐篷外，恭候着来参加婚礼的客人们。哈利喝了大剂量的复方汤剂，现在成了当地奥特里·圣卡奇波尔村里一个红头发麻瓜男孩的模样，弗雷德用飞来咒偷了那个男孩的几根头发。他们计划向客人介绍哈利是“堂弟巴尼”，反正韦斯莱家的亲威众多，但愿能够把他掩护住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden-jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree; Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个人手里都捏着座次表，可以帮着指点客人坐到合适的座位上。一小时前，来了一群穿白色长袍的侍者和一支穿金黄色上衣的乐队，此刻这些巫师都坐在不远处的一棵树下，抽着烟斗。哈利可以看见那里袅袅升起的一片青色的烟雾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When I get married," said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, "I won't be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I'll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it's all over."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等我结婚的时候，”弗雷德一边扯着他长袍的领子，一边说道，“我才不搞这些讨厌的名堂呢。你们爱穿什么就穿什么，我要给妈妈来一个全身束缚咒，一直到事情办完。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She wasn't too bad this morning, considering," said George. "CRIed a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves -- here they come, look."</div>

<div class="line_en">Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches' hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards' cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在院子的最远端，一个又一个色彩鲜艳的身影凭空出现。几分钟后就形成了一支队伍，开始蜿蜒穿过花园，朝大帐篷走来。奇异的花朵和带魔法的小鸟在女巫们的帽子上颤动，珍贵的宝石在许多巫师的领结上闪闪发光。这群人离帐篷越来越近，兴奋的、嘁嘁喳喳的说话声越来越响，淹没了蜜蜂的嗡嗡声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins," said George, craning his neck for a better look. "They'll need help understanding our English customs, I'll look after them…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's fine, I understand," said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin's face fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred's directions he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，我理解。”哈利更多是对卢平说的。卢平迅速朝他笑了笑，但他们转过身去时，哈利看见卢平的脸又变得阴郁愁苦起来。哈利很不理解，但没有时间琢磨这件事了：海格制造了一场大混乱。他把弗雷德指点的位置搞错了，没有坐在后排专门给他用魔法增大、加固的那个座位上，而是一屁股坐在了五把椅子上，现在那些椅子就像一大堆金色的火柴棍儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wotcher," said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. "Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night," she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. "The Ministry's being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊。”他刚走出帐篷就听到一个熟悉的声音，接着看见唐克斯和卢平站在队伍前面。唐克斯专门把头发变成了金黄色。“亚瑟告诉我说你是卷头发的那个。昨晚真是抱歉，”哈利领他们走过通道时，她压低声音说，“魔法部目前对狼人镇压得很厉害，我们认为我们在场恐怕会给你们惹麻烦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not so fast, Your Holeyness," said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession, he said, "Here -- permettez-moi to assister vous," to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley's old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry's lot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不用这么着急，洞听，”弗雷德说着，冲过队伍前面的那群中年女巫，抢先对两个漂亮的法国姑娘说道，“嘿——请允许我为你们服务。【原文为法语】”法国姑娘咯咯笑着，让他陪着她们进去了。剩下乔治去对付那些中年女巫，罗恩负责招呼韦斯莱先生在魔法部的老同事珀金斯，而落到哈利手里的，是一对耳朵很背的老夫妻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“谢诺菲留斯·洛夫古德，”他朝哈利伸出一只手说，“我和女儿就住在山上，善良的韦斯莱夫妇好心邀请了我们。我想你认识我们家卢娜吧？”后面这句话是对罗恩说的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯莱先生在修复那些破烂，海格大声对每个肯听他说话的人道歉，哈利匆匆回到入口处，发现罗恩正与一个模样十分古怪的巫师面对面站着。那人有点对眼儿，棉花糖一般的白发蓬在肩头，帽子上穗子直垂到鼻子前面，身上穿着一件蛋黄色的长袍，颜色耀眼刺目。他脖子上挂着一根金链子，上面闪着一个古怪的符号，很像一只三角形的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes -- or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi."</div>

<div class="line_en">Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, "Daddy, look -- one of the gnomes actually bit me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢诺菲留斯正和一个熟人谈得投机，没有听见卢娜和哈利之间的对话。他跟那个巫师道了别，转脸看着女儿，卢娜举起一根手指说：“爸爸，看——一只地精居然咬了我！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!" said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna's outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks. "Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today -- perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish -- do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太棒了！地精的唾液特别有用！”洛夫古德先生说着，抓住卢娜伸出的手指，仔细打量那个出血点，“卢娜，我亲爱的，如果你今天觉得有什么才华冒头——也许是一种突如其来的冲动，想唱歌剧，想用人鱼的语言朗诵——千万不要抑制它！那可能是工兵精赠给你的才华！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，没关系。”卢娜说，她像做梦一样吮着手指，上上下下地打量着哈利，“你看着真精神。我对爸爸说大多数人大概都会穿礼服长袍，但他相信出席婚礼应该穿太阳色的衣服，为了讨个彩头，你知道的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the first time there was no queue outside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩意味深长地看了哈利一眼，走了过去，很长时间没再露面。当他们在入口处再次碰面时，哈利已经又领十几个客人找到座位。帐篷里差不多坐满了，外面总算不再排队了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nightmare, Muriel is," said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. "She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she'll have written them out of her will -- like they care, they're going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they're going… Wow," he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. "You look great!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“穆丽尔简直是个噩梦，”罗恩用袖子擦着脑门说，“她以前每年都来过圣诞节，后来，谢天谢地，她生气了，因为弗雷德和乔治吃饭时在她椅子底下放了个粪弹。爸爸总说她在遗嘱里不会赠给他们俩任何东西——他们才不稀罕呢，以后家里谁也赶不上他们俩有钱，估计他们会……哇，”他快速地眨巴眼睛，看着赫敏匆匆朝他们走来，“你的样子太棒了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I've just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara," she shouted at Harry. "Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She's a good-looking girl, but still -- French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呣，找借口，是吗？看来他倒不像报纸照片上那样没头脑。我刚才一直在教新娘怎么戴我的头饰才最好看，”她嚷嚷着对哈利说，“妖精做的，知道吗，在我们家流传了好几个世纪。她倒是个漂亮姑娘，不过到底是个——法国人。好了，好了，快给我找个好座位，罗恩，我都一百零七岁了，最好别站得太久。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn't agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, "Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?" and then, "Bad posture and skinny ankles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“总是用这副吃惊的口气。”赫敏说，不过脸上还是笑着。她穿着一件飘逸的淡紫色长裙，脚下是配套的高跟鞋，头发光滑、柔顺。“你的姨婆穆丽尔可不这么认为，刚才我在楼上碰到她在给芙蓉送头饰。她说：‘噢，天哪，这就是那个麻瓜出身的？’然后又说：‘姿势不美，踝骨太突出。’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是说穆丽尔吗？”乔治和弗雷德一起从大帐篷里钻出来，问道，“是啊，她刚才还说我的耳朵不对称，这个老太婆！噢，我真希望比利尔斯叔叔还在。他在婚礼上可是个活宝。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们笑得太厉害了，谁也没有注意到新来的人，那是个黑头发的年轻人，大鹰钩鼻子，两道黑黑的浓眉。最后他把请柬递到罗恩面前，眼睛盯着赫敏说：“你看上去太美了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果说刚才多吉显出的是惊恐的神情，那跟他此刻的神情相比简直不算什么，就好像穆丽尔一刀刺中了他似的。穆丽尔姨婆咯咯大笑，又喝了一大口香槟，酒顺着下巴滴滴答答地流下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes I was," said Doge, through trembling lips. "And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot," said Auntie Muriel happily. "Bathilda desCRIbed the whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus's fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that's odd enough in itself, Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我母亲跟巴希达·巴沙特关系很好，”穆丽尔姨婆兴高采烈地说，“巴希达跟我母亲讲述了整个事情，我在门口听见了。棺材边的争斗！巴希达说，阿不福思大声嚷嚷说阿利安娜的死都怪阿不思，然后一拳砸在阿不思脸上。巴希达说，阿不思甚至都没有抵挡一下，这本身就够奇怪的，阿不思即使两个手捆在背后跟阿不福思决斗，也能把他干掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe: He wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.</div>
