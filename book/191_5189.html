<div class="line_en">To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.</div>

<div class="line_en">They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，他们前进得很顺利，当他们到达河中间，急流却把木筏冲向下流去，使他们离开黄砖铺砌的路越来越远了。水也逐渐逐渐地深起来，使得长木杆触不到河底。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，这个小团体的旅客们醒来，重新振作精神，充满了希望。多萝茜吃的早餐，是从河边的树上摘下来的桃子和梅子，好像一个公主所吃的。留下在他们后面的，是一片黑暗的森林，虽然他们在那里痛苦地遇到了许多的危险，但都已经安全地穿过了。横在他们面前的，是一个可爱的光明的地方，它似乎正在点点头，招招手，邀请他们走上到翡翠城去的路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can," the Scarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out again -- or let go -- the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“倘使我们能够努力的话，一定能够到达翡翠城的。”稻草人接着说。他用力撑着长杆，把它插到了河底的淤泥里，在将要把木杆拔出来，或者干脆丢掉它以前，木筏被急流冲开去。可怜的稻草人，他只能抱住紧紧地插在河中的木杆上，被留下来吊了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在我比当初遇见多萝茜的时候更加坏了，”他想，“那时候，我被吊起在稻田里的竹竿上，无论如何，在那里我还可以伪装着一个人，恐吓乌鸦们，但是在这里，一个稻草人截起在河中的一根木杆上，是毫无用处的。我很伤心我将永远没有脑子了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the Lion said: "Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail." So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's long pole and helped push the raft to the land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子说：“我们必须想法子自己救出自己。我想我能够游泳到岸边，把木筏拖在我的后面，只要你们拉紧我的尾巴。”狮子就跳到水里去，当它开始用全身的力量游向岸边去时，铁皮人便拉紧它的尾巴，狮子身体这么大，这是艰苦的工作。不久以后，他们被拖出了这股急流。多萝茜拿起铁皮人的长木杆，帮助着把木筏推向岸边去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们尽力地向前快跑，多萝茜只停了一次，去摘取一朵美丽的花。在这以后，铁皮人大声喊了出来：“看呀！”他们一齐向河里望去，看见稻草人高高地抱紧着插在河中的木杆上，样子十分的寂寞和忧愁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，当他们休息够了，多萝茜提起她的篮子，沿着长着很多草的堤岸动身，回到那被河水带走的地方去。那是一个可爱的地方，有许多的花和果树，太阳光鼓舞着他们，如果他们不是为了稻草人而忧愁，他们将十分的快乐了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know. So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子和铁皮人两个都摇摇他们的头，不知道怎么办，就在岸滩上坐下来，苦苦地默默地凝视着稻草人。后来有一只鹳鸟飞过，鹳鸟看见了他们，便在水边停下来休息了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them.

<div class="line_en">They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他们跑到了深红色的大罂粟花开得更加茂盛的地方，旁的花儿愈来愈少了。过了一会儿他们发觉自已已经走在大罂粟花田中了。这是人人知道的，如果这种花大伙儿生长在一起时，它们的香气多么浓烈，不论什么人呼吸了，都要昏昏地睡去。如果这个睡着的人，不从这些花儿中走开，就要永远地睡着了。但是多萝茜不知道这个，也不从这鲜明的红色的花丛中走开，所以她的眼睛立刻沉重起来，觉得必须坐下来休息，并且要睡觉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I always did like flowers," said the Lion. "They of seem so helpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these."</div>
