<div class="line_en">Just before Marilyn had given Lydia that first diary, the university had held its annual Christmas party. Marilyn had not wanted to go. All fall she'd been wrestling a vague discontentment. Nath had just started the first grade, Lydia had just started nursery school, Hannah had not yet even been imagined. For the first time since she'd been married, Marilyn found herself unoccupied. She was twenty-nine years old, still young, still slender. Still smart, she thought. She could go back to school now, at last, and finish her degree. Do everything she'd planned before the children came along. Only now she couldn't remember how to write a paper, how to take notes; it seemed as vague and hazy as something she had done in a dream. How could she study when dinner needed cooking, when Nath needed to be tucked in, when Lydia wanted to play? She leafed through the Help Wanted ads in the paper, but they were all for waitresses, accountants, copywriters. Nothing she knew how to do. She thought of her mother, the life her mother had wanted for her, the life her mother had hoped to lead herself: husband, children, house, her sole job to keep it all in order. Without meaning to, she'd acquired it. There was nothing more her mother could have wished her. The thought did not put her in a festive mood.</div>

<div class="line_en">James, however, had insisted that they put in an appearance at the Christmas party; he was up for tenure in the spring, and appearances mattered. So they had asked Vivian Allen from across the street to babysit Nath and Lydia, and Marilyn put on a peach cocktail dress and her pearls and they headed to the crepe-papered gymnasium, where a Christmas tree had been erected on the midcourt line. Then, after the obligatory round of hellos and how-are-yous, she retreated to the corner, nursing a cup of rum punch. That was where she ran into Tom Lawson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆斯却坚持认为他们应该到圣诞派对上露个脸；来年春天，他就要成为终身教授，所以，露脸是必须的。于是，他们请街对面的薇薇安·艾伦帮忙照看内斯和莉迪亚。玛丽琳换了条桃红色短裙，戴着珍珠项链，和詹姆斯来到装饰着彩色绉纸的学校体育馆，一棵圣诞树已经在中场区竖立起来。几圈寒暄过后，她端着一杯朗姆酒退到角落里，就在这时，她遇到了汤姆·劳森。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom brought her a slice of fruitcake and introduced himself -- he was a professor in the chemistry department; he and James had worked together on the thesis committee of a double-majoring student who'd written about chemical warfare in World War I. Marilyn tensed against the inevitable questions -- And what do you do, Marilyn? -- but instead they exchanged the usual benign civilities: how old the children were, how nice this year's Christmas tree looked. And when he began to tell her about the research he was doing -- something to do with the pancreas and artificial insulin -- she interrupted to ask if he needed a research assistant, and he stared at her over his plate of pigs in blankets. Marilyn, afraid of seeming unqualified, offered a flood of explanations: she had been a chemistry major at Radcliffe and she'd been planning on medical school and she hadn't quite finished her degree -- yet -- but now that the children were a bit older --</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom Lawson grinned. "I guess I could use some help," he said. "If your husband doesn't mind, that is. Maybe we could meet and talk about it after New Year's, when term starts." And Marilyn said yes, yes, that would be wonderful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆·劳森笑了。“我猜，我的确需要帮助。”他说，“如果你的丈夫不介意的话，那就可以。也许我们可以在新年之后谈谈，新学期开始的时候。”玛丽琳连连答应，表示这是再好不过的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, Tom Lawson had been surprised at the tone of her request: it had the murmured, breathless quality of a proposition. Marilyn looked up at him and smiled, and her deep dimples gave her the earnestness of a little girl.</div>

<div class="line_en">James was less enthusiastic. He knew what people would say: He couldn't make enough -- his wife had to hire herself out. Years had passed, but he still remembered his mother rising early each morning and donning her uniform, how one winter, when she'd been home from work with the flu for two weeks, they'd had to turn off the heat and bundle in double blankets. He remembered how at night, his mother would massage oil into her calloused hands, trying to soften them, and his father would leave the room, ashamed. "No," he told Marilyn. "When I get tenure, we'll have all the money we need." He took her hand, uncurled her fingers, kissed her soft palm. "Tell me you won't worry about working anymore," he said, and at last she had agreed. But she kept Tom Lawson's phone number.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆斯没有她那么热情。他知道别人会怎么说：他挣得不够多——他妻子不得不出去找工作。尽管已经过去了很多年，他仍然记得他母亲每天早早起来，穿上制服去工作。一年冬天，她因为流感在家里休息了两周，他们不得不关掉暖气裹在两床毛毯里面。到了晚上，他母亲会给自己粗硬的双手涂油，想让皮肤变得柔软一些，见此情景，他父亲会愧疚地离开房间。“不，”他告诉玛丽琳，“等我成为终身教授，我们就不缺钱了。”他拉起她的手，掰开她的手指，吻她柔软的掌心。“告诉我，你不会再想着出去工作。”他说。最后她终于同意了，但是，她还是保留了汤姆·劳森的电话号码。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By then she had not spoken to her mother in almost eight years, since her wedding day. In all that time, her mother had not written once. When Nath had been born, then Lydia, Marilyn had not informed her mother, had not even sent a photograph. What was there to say? She and James had never discussed what her mother had said about their marriage that last day: it's not right. She had not ever wanted to think of it again. So when James came home that night, she said simply, "My mother died." Then she turned back to the stove and added, "And the lawn needs mowing," and he understood: they would not talk about it. At dinner, when she told the children that their grandmother had died, Lydia cocked her head and asked, "Are you sad?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="婚礼那天过后，她已经近八年没和母亲说话，在此期间，她母亲也没给她写过一封信。内斯出生、莉迪亚出生，玛丽琳都没有通知母亲，连孩子的照片都没给她寄过。有什么好说的？她和詹姆斯从未讨论过她母亲在婚礼那天对这场婚姻的评价：这样不对。她根本不想再去回忆。所以，当詹姆斯晚上回到家时，玛丽琳只是简短地说了句：“我母亲死了。”然后她走到炉子那里，又补充道，“草坪需要修了。”他立刻明白，他们不会再讨论这件事。晚饭时，玛丽琳告诉孩子们外婆去世了，莉迪亚翘起脑袋问：“你难过吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, in the spring, while James -- newly tenured -- was at work and the children were at school and Marilyn, at home, folded her second load of laundry, the phone rang. A nurse from St. Catherine's Hospital, in Virginia, telling her that her mother had died. A stroke. It was April 1, 1966, and the first thing Marilyn thought was: what a terrible, tasteless joke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二年春天，詹姆斯——新晋终身教授——开始上班，孩子们开始上学，玛丽琳待在家里折叠洗好的衣服，这时，电话响了——弗吉尼亚州圣凯瑟琳医院的一位护士告诉玛丽琳，她母亲去世了。那天是1966年4月1日，玛丽琳的第一个反应是：真是个可怕的、没有品位的笑话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were things to be taken care of: papers to be signed, burial arrangements to be made. So Marilyn left the children with James and drove to Virginia -- she'd long since stopped thinking of it as home -- to sort out her mother's things. As mile after mile of Ohio, then West Virginia, streamed past, her daughter's question echoed in her mind. She could not answer for sure.</div>

<div class="line_en">Was she sad? She was more surprised than anything: surprised at how familiar her mother's house still felt. Even after eight years, she still remembered exactly how to wiggle the key -- down and to the left -- to get the lock to open; she still remembered the screen door that slowly closed itself with a hiss. The light in the foyer had burned out and the heavy curtains in the living room were closed, but her feet moved by instinct despite the dark: years of rehearsal had taught her the dance step around the armchair and the ottoman to the table beside the sofa. Her fingers caught the ribbed switch of the lamp on the first try. It could have been her house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她难过吗？更多的是惊讶，惊讶于自己竟然还是如此熟悉母亲的房子。即使过了八年，她仍然记得怎么晃动钥匙——先向下，再向左——才能打开门锁；仍然记得纱门会自动缓缓关闭，发出嘶嘶的声音。前厅的炉火燃尽了，起居室的厚窗帘拉上了，但她能够凭直觉在黑暗中前进。她在扶手椅、搁脚凳、桌子和沙发之间灵活地穿行，一下子就准确地摸到电灯的棱纹开关。这里本可以成为她的家的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the light came on, she saw the same shabby furniture she'd grown up with, the same pale lilac wallpaper with a grain, like silk. The same china cabinet full of her mother's dolls, whose unblinking eyes gave her the same cold tingle on the back of her neck. On the mantel, the same photographs of her as a child. All the things that she needed to clear away. Was she sad? No, after the daylong drive, only tired. "Many people find this job overwhelming," the undertaker told her the next morning. He gave her the number of a cleaning company that specialized in making houses ready to sell. Ghouls, Marilyn thought. What a job, clearing the homes of the dead, piling whole lives into garbage bins and lugging them to the curb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灯光亮起，她看到自己小时候那些熟悉的破旧家具，褪色的淡紫墙纸，上面有丝绸一样的纹理。瓷器柜里装满了她母亲的玩具娃娃，它们的眼睛一眨不眨，依然让她觉得脖子后面发凉。这些东西都需要她清走。她难过吗？不，赶了一天的路，她只觉得累。“很多人都觉得难以胜任这项工作。”第二天早晨，殡仪馆的工作人员告诉她。他给了她一个公司的电话号码，他们专门帮客户打理需要卖掉的房子。食尸鬼，玛丽琳想。真是个贴心的服务，清理死者的房子，把他们的一生扔进垃圾桶，再把垃圾桶拖到马路边上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when she tried to sort her mother's things, she could find nothing she wanted to keep. Her mother's gold ring, her twelve settings of china, the pearl bracelet from Marilyn's father: mementos of an ill-fated wedding day. Her demure sweater sets and pencil skirts, the gloves and hat-boxed hats: relics of a corseted existence that Marilyn had always pitied. Her mother had loved her doll collection, but their faces were blank as chalk, white china masks under horsehair wigs. Little strangers with cold stares. Marilyn leafed through photo albums for a picture of herself with her mother and couldn't find one. Only Marilyn in kindergarten pigtails; Marilyn in third grade with a missing front tooth; Marilyn at a school party, a paper crown on her head. Marilyn in high school in front of the Christmas tree in a precious Kodachrome. Three photo albums of Marilyn and not a single shot of her mother. As if her mother had never been there.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, in the kitchen, she discovered her mother's Betty Crocker cookbook, the spine cracking and mended, twice, with Scotch tape. On the first page of the cookie section, a deliberate line in the margin of the introduction, the kind she herself had made in college to mark an important passage. It was no recipe. Always cookies in the cookie jar! the paragraph read. Is there a happier symbol of a friendly house? That was all. Her mother had felt the need to highlight this. Marilyn glanced at the cow-shaped cookie jar on the counter and tried to picture the bottom. The more she thought about it, the less sure she was that she had ever seen it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，她在厨房里发现了母亲的《贝蒂·克罗克烹饪书》，开裂的书脊曾经修补过两次，用思高胶带粘着。在“饼干”部分的第一页，引言旁边的空白处有一条线，玛丽琳上大学的时候，会用这种线标出书上的重点。这段话并非制作饼干的说明。饼干罐里一定要有饼干！这段写着，难道除此之外，还有更能表现家庭友好气氛的东西吗？就是这些话。她母亲觉得，需要把它们当作重点划出来。玛丽琳瞥了一眼柜台上奶牛形状的饼干罐，想看看它是不是空的，结果越是打量，越不确定自己曾经见过这件东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She flipped through the other chapters, looking for more pencil lines. In "Pies," she found another: If you care about pleasing a man -- bake a pie. But make sure it's a perfect pie. Pity the man who has never come home to a pumpkin or custard pie. Under "Basic Eggs": The man you marry will know the way he likes his eggs. And chances are he'll be fussy about them. So it behooves a good wife to know how to make an egg behave in six basic ways. She imagined her mother touching the pencil tip to her tongue, then drawing a careful dark mark down the margin so that she would remember.</div>

<div class="line_en">Marilyn looked at Betty Crocker's portrait on the back cover of the cookbook, the faint streaks of gray at her temples, the hair that curled back from her forehead, as if pushed back by the arch of her eyebrow. For a second, it resembled her mother. Is there anything that gives you a deeper sense of satisfaction? Certainly her mother would have said no, no, no. She thought with sharp and painful pity of her mother, who had planned on a golden, vanilla-scented life but ended up alone, trapped like a fly in this small and sad and empty house, this small and sad and empty life, her daughter gone, no trace of herself left except these pencil-marked dreams.

<div class="line_en">By dinnertime, the men had emptied the entire house. One of them tipped his hat to Marilyn; the other gave her a polite little nod. Then they stepped out onto the stoop, and the truck's engine started outside. She moved from room to room, the cookbook tucked under her arm, checking that nothing had been left behind, but the men had been thorough. Her old room was hardly recognizable with the pictures peeled from its walls. The only signs of her time there were the thumbtack holes in the wallpaper, invisible unless you knew where to look. It could have been a stranger's house. Through the open curtains she could see nothing, only panes of dusk and her face faintly reflected back to her in the glow of the ceiling light. On her way out, she paused in the living room, where the carpet was pockmarked with the ghosts of chair feet, and studied the mantel, now a clean line under a stretch of bare wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚餐时间之前，他们就清空了房子。其中一人朝玛丽琳抬抬帽檐，另一个冲她礼貌地点点头。然后，他们就走出门廊，发动了外面的卡车。她从一个房间走到另一个房间，胳膊下面夹着烹饪书，检查有没有落下的东西，但他们清理得很彻底。拿下了墙上的照片后，她的旧房间简直面目全非，难以辨认。她童年时代的唯一印记只剩下图钉留在墙纸上的小洞，除非你知道它们原本在哪里，否则根本找不到。顺着敞开的窗帘望出去，她什么也看不见，只有昏暗的窗玻璃和灯光照耀下她那模糊的脸。她离开时，在起居室逗留了一下，地毯上还有椅子腿压出的小坑，原本是壁炉架的地方只剩下光光的墙面上的一条直线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning, she called the housecleaning company the undertaker had recommended. The two men who arrived at her door wore blue uniforms, like janitors. They were clean-shaven and courteous; they looked at her with sympathy but said nothing about "your loss." With the efficiency of movers they packed dolls and dishes and clothes into cartons. They swaddled furniture in quilted pads and trundled it to the truck. Where did it go, Marilyn wondered, cradling the cookbook -- the mattresses, the photographs, the emptied-out bookshelves? The same place people went when they died, where everything went: on, away, out of your life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside Charlottesville, flecks of rain appeared on the windows. Halfway across West Virginia the rain grew heavy, sheeting the windshield. Marilyn pulled to the roadside and turned off the car, and the wipers stopped midsweep, two slashes across the glass. It was past one o'clock in the morning and no one else was on the road: no taillights on the horizon, no headlights in the rearview, only farmland stretching out on either side.

Marilyn thought uneasily of her own life, of hours spent making breakfasts, serving dinners, packing lunches into neat paper bags. How was it possible to spend so many hours spreading peanut butter across bread? How was it possible to spend so many hours cooking eggs? Sunny-side up for James. Hard-boiled for Nath.

<div class="line_en">What they did was head to the Y to learn the breaststroke. Lydia hadn't yet learned to swim, so James left her across the street with Mrs. Allen for the afternoon. All week he had looked forward to some father-son time. He had even planned out how he would begin: Keep your arms underwater. Whip your legs out. Like this. Although James himself had been a swimmer in high school, he had never won a trophy; he had gone home alone while the others piled into someone's car for celebratory hamburgers and milkshakes. Now he suspected that Nath had the makings of a swimmer, too: he was short, but he was wiry and strong. In last summer's swim class, he had learned the front crawl and the dead-man's float; already he could swim underwater all the way across the pool. In high school, James imagined, Nath would be the star of the team, the collector of trophies, the anchorman in the relay. He would be the one driving everyone to the diner -- or wherever kids would go in the far-off 1970s -- after meets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们决定到游泳池学蛙泳。莉迪亚还没学过游泳，所以，詹姆斯下午把她寄放在街对面的艾伦夫人家。过去的一周，他一直想和内斯度过一些父子独享的时间。他甚至想好了游泳课的开场白：胳膊一直放在水下，向外蹬腿，像这样。虽然詹姆斯本人在高中时是游泳运动员，但他没有得过奖牌；当其他人钻进获奖者的车里，去享用汉堡和奶昔以示庆贺时，他只能独自回家。现在，詹姆斯觉得内斯可能具备同样的游泳天赋，虽然他个子矮，但身体结实强壮。去年夏天的游泳课上，内斯学会了自由泳和漂浮，已经能游着从水底穿过游泳池。詹姆斯觉得，到了高中，内斯就会成为游泳队的明星、奖牌的包揽者、游泳比赛的王牌。赢得比赛之后，他将开车请大家吃饭——或者去做七十年代孩子们喜欢做的事情来庆祝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That Saturday, when they got to the pool, the shallow end was full of children playing Marco Polo; in the deep end, a pair of elderly men glided in laps. No space for breaststroke lessons yet. James nudged his son. "Go in and play with the others until the pool empties out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个星期六，他们来到泳池边，浅水区全是些玩“马可波罗”的孩子；深水区有两个划水的大人。还没有地方练习蛙泳。詹姆斯推推儿子：“先进去和大家玩，等着泳池空出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We came here to swim," James said. "Mrs. Allen is watching your sister just so you could learn the breaststroke, Nathan. Don't waste everyone's time." He tugged the towel from his son's grasp and steered him firmly toward the water, hovering over him until he slid in. Then he sat down on the vacant poolside bench, nudging aside discarded flippers and goggles. It's good for him, James thought. He needs to learn how to make friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们是来游泳的，”詹姆斯说，“艾伦夫人看着你妹妹，好让你能学习蛙泳，内斯。不要浪费大家的时间。”他用力拽掉儿子手中的毛巾，坚决地领着他走向水池边，紧逼着他，直到儿子滑进水里。他随后在池边的空地上坐下来，把别人扔在那里的脚蹼和护目镜推到一边。这对他有好处，詹姆斯想。他需要学学怎么交朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do I have to?" Nath asked, pleating the edge of his towel. The only other kid he recognized was Jack, who by then had been living on their street for a month. Although Nath had not yet come to hate him, he already sensed that they would not be friends. At seven Jack was tall and lanky, freckled and bold, afraid of nothing. James, not attuned to the sensitivities of the playground, was suddenly annoyed at his son's shyness, his reluctance. The confident young man in his imagination dwindled to a nervous little boy: skinny, small, hunched so deeply that his chest was concave. And though he would not admit it, Nath -- legs twisted, stacking the toes of one foot atop the other -- reminded him of himself at that age.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nath circled the girl who was It with the other children, bouncing on his toes to keep his head above water. It took James a few minutes to recognize Jack, and when he did, it was with a twinge of admiration. Jack was a good swimmer, cocky and confident in the water, weaving around the others, shining and breathless. He must have walked over by himself, James decided; all spring, Vivian Allen had been whispering about Janet Wolff, how she left Jack alone while she worked at the hospital. Maybe we can give him a ride home, he thought. He could stay to play at our house until his mother finishes her shift. He would be a nice friend for Nath, a good role model. He imagined Nath and Jack inseparable, rigging a tire swing in the backyard, biking through the neighborhood. In his own schooldays, he'd been embarrassed to ask classmates to his house, afraid that they'd recognize his mother from the lunch line, or his father from mopping the hallway. They hadn't had a yard, anyway. Maybe they would play pirates, Jack as the captain and Nath as the first mate. Sheriff and deputy. Batman and Robin.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time James focused his attention back on the pool, Nath was It. But something was wrong. The other children glided away. Silently, stifling giggles, they hoisted themselves out of the water and onto the tile surround. Eyes closed, Nath drifted all alone in the middle of the pool, wading in small circles, feeling his way through the water with his hands. James could hear him: Marco. Marco.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等詹姆斯回过神来，他发现内斯成了“捉人者”。但情况有些不对劲。别的孩子都游到池边去了，他们纷纷忍着笑钻出水面，爬到岸上。内斯闭着眼睛，一个人漂浮在池水中央转着小圈，双手在水中探路。詹姆斯听到他说：“马可。马可。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Nath opened his eyes, and the glow vanished. He saw the other kids squatting around the pool, laughing now, the pool empty except for Jack in front of him. Jack himself turned to Nath and grinned. To Nath, it was a taunt: Joke's on you. He shoved Jack aside and ducked underwater, and when he reemerged at the edge, he climbed straight out without shaking himself. He didn't even wipe the water from his eyes, just let it stream over his face as he stalked toward the door, and because of this James could not tell if he was crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯睁开眼睛，得意的神情立刻不见了，他看到其他孩子都蹲在池边笑他，水池里只有杰克在他眼前，正朝他咧着嘴笑。内斯觉得那是奚落的笑容：只是逗你玩玩而已。他把杰克推到一边，潜进水中，一口气游到池边，径直上岸向门口走去，他没抖去身上的水，连眼睛上的水也不擦，就那么让它顺着脸颊流下来，所以，詹姆斯根本看不出他哭了没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the sidelines, his father, too, was uncertain. Could he make the children get back in the pool? Saying anything would draw attention to the trick. He could call his son. It's time to go home, he might say. Then Nath would open his eyes and see nothing but water all around him. The smell of chlorine began to bite at James's nostrils. Then, on the far side of the pool, he saw the blur of a body sliding silently into the water. A figure glided toward Nath, a sandy head broke the surface: Jack.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the locker room, Nath refused to say a word. He refused to put his clothes or even his shoes on, and when James held out his slacks for the third time, Nath kicked the locker so hard he left a dent in the door. James glanced back over his shoulder and saw Jack peeking through the door from the pool area. He wondered if Jack was about to speak, maybe apologize, but instead he stood silent and staring. Nath, who hadn't spotted Jack at all, marched out into the lobby, and James bundled up their things and let the door swing shut behind them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Part of him wanted to gather his son into his arms, to tell him that he understood. Even after almost thirty years, he still remembered P. E. class at Lloyd, how once he'd gotten tangled up in his shirt and emerged to find his pants missing from the bench. Everyone else had already dressed and was stuffing gym uniforms into lockers and lacing shoes. He had tiptoed back into the gym, hiding his bare thighs and calves behind his knapsack, looking for Mr. Childs, the P. E. teacher. By then the bell had rung and the locker room had emptied. After ten minutes of searching, mortified at being in his undershorts in front of Mr. Childs, his pants were revealed under a sink, legs tied around the U-bend, dust bunnies caught in the cuffs. "Probably just got mixed up in someone else's things," Mr. Childs had said. "Hurry along to class now, Lee. You're tardy." James had known it was no accident. After that, he had developed a system: pants first, then shirt. He had never told anyone about it, but the memory clung.</div>

<div class="line_en">That afternoon, though, he let Nath run up to his room and slam the door. At dinnertime, when he knocked to offer a Salisbury steak, Nath did not respond, and downstairs, James allowed Lydia to nestle against him on the couch and watch The Jackie Gleason Show. What could he say to comfort his son? It will get better? He could not bring himself to lie. Better just to forget the whole thing.

<div class="line_en">Marilyn hung up without bothering to reply. For a long time, she stood in the kitchen by the phone, staring through the window. Outside, it no longer felt like spring. The wind had turned biting and dry; the daffodils, tricked by the warm weather, bent their faces to the ground. All across the garden, they lay prostrate, stems broken, yellow trumpets withered. Marilyn wiped the table and pulled the crossword puzzle toward her, trying to forget the amusement in Tom Lawson's voice. The newsprint clung to the damp wood, and as she wrote in her first answer, the pen tore through the paper, leaving a blue "A" on the tabletop.</div>

<div class="line_en">She took her car keys down from their hook and lifted her handbag from the entry table. At first she told herself she was just going out to clear her head. Despite the chill, she rolled the window down, and as she circled the lake once, twice, the breeze snaked its way beneath her hair to the nape of her neck. With your children and husband and all. She drove without thinking, all the way through Middlewood, past the campus and the grocery store and the roller rink, and only when she found herself turning into the hospital parking lot did she realize this was where she'd intended to come all along.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside, Marilyn settled in the corner of the waiting room. Someone had painted the room -- walls, ceiling, doors -- a pale, calming blue. White-hatted, white-skirted nurses glided in and out like clouds, bearing syringes of insulin, bottles of pills, rolls of gauze. Candy stripers buzzed by with carts of lunch trays. And the doctors: they strode unhurried through the bustle like jets cutting their steady way through the sky. Whenever they appeared, heads turned toward them; anxious husbands and hysterical mothers and tentative daughters stood up at their approach. They were all men, Marilyn noticed: Dr. Kenger, Dr. Gordon, Dr. McLenahan, Dr. Stone. What had made her think she could be one of them? It seemed as impossible as turning into a tiger.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, through the double doors from the emergency room: a slender dark-haired figure, hair pulled back in a neat bun. For a moment, Marilyn could not place her. "Dr. Wolff," one of the nurses called, lifting a clipboard from the counter, and Dr. Wolff crossed the room to take it, her heels clack-clacking on the linoleum. Marilyn had seen Janet Wolff only once or twice since she'd moved in a month before, but she would not have recognized her anyway. She had heard that Janet Wolff worked at the hospital -- Vivian Allen, leaning over the garden fence, had whispered about late shifts, the Wolff boy left to run wild -- but she had pictured a secretary, a nurse. Not this graceful woman, no older than she, tall in black slacks, a white doctor's coat loose around her slim frame. This Dr. Wolff, a stethoscope looped around her neck like a shining silver necklace, who with expert hands touched and turned the bruised wrist of a workman, who called clear and confident across the room, "Dr. Gordon, may I have a word with you about your patient, please?" And Dr. Gordon put down his clipboard, and came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，急诊室的两扇门敞开了，一个深色头发的瘦削身影出现，发髻挽在脑后。玛丽琳一时间没弄明白这个女人是干吗的。“伍尔夫医生。”一个护士叫道，举起柜台上的一个记事板。伍尔夫医生穿过候诊室，接过记事板，她的高跟鞋敲打着地毡。自从珍妮特·伍尔夫一个月前搬过来，玛丽琳只见过她一两次。她听说珍妮特·伍尔夫在医院工作——薇薇安·艾伦趴在花园的篱笆上小声告诉她，伍尔夫经常在医院值夜班，对儿子放任不管，结果，他成了野孩子。但玛丽琳以为伍尔夫是个秘书或者护士，而眼前这个优雅的女人，年龄不比她大，个子高挑，身材苗条，穿着黑色的宽松长裤，医生的白大褂，不可能是那个伍尔夫。这个伍尔夫医生，脖子上挂着听诊器，好似一条银光闪闪的项链，正手法娴熟地检查着一个工人青肿的手腕。只听她清晰自信地对诊室另一头说：“戈登医生，我能和你谈谈你的病人的情况吗？”戈登医生放下他的记事板，走了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Bake a cake to take to a party. Bake a cake just because you feel good today. She pictured her mother creaming shortening and sugar, sifting flour, greasing a pan. Is there anything that gives you a deeper sense of satisfaction? There was Janet Wolff striding across the hospital waiting room, her coat so white it glowed.</div>

<div class="line_en">While the children were at school, she drove an hour to the community college outside Toledo and enrolled in organic chemistry, advanced statistics, anatomy: everything she'd planned for her last semesters. The next day, she made the drive again and found a furnished efficiency near the campus, signing a lease for the first of May. Two weeks away. Every night, when she was alone, she read the cookbook again, steeling herself with her mother's small and lonely life. You don't want this, she reminded herself. There will be more to your life than this. Lydia and Nath would be fine, she told herself again and again. She would not let herself think otherwise. James would be there. Look how they had managed while she was in Virginia. It was still possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the quiet dark, she packed her old college textbooks into cartons and tucked them in the attic, ready to go. As May approached, she cooked lavish meal after lavish meal: Swedish meatballs, beef Stroganoff, chicken à la king -- everything James and the children liked best, everything from scratch, just as her mother had taught her. She baked a pink birthday cake for Lydia and let her eat as much as she wanted. On the first of May, after Sunday dinner, she sealed leftovers in Tupperware and put them in the freezer; she baked batch after batch of cookies. "It's like you're preparing for a famine," James said, laughing, and Marilyn smiled back, a fake smile, the same one she had given to her mother all those years. You lifted the corners of your mouth toward your ears. You kept your lips closed. It was amazing how no one could tell.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the bus had disappeared around the curve of the lake, she visited her daughter's room, then her son's. From Lydia's dresser she took a single barrette, cherry-colored Bakelite with a white flower, one of a pair she seldom wore. From the cigar box beneath Nath's bed she took a marble, not his favorite -- the cobalt with white specks like stars -- but one of the little dark ones, the ones he called oilies. From the inside of James's overcoat, the old one he'd worn in her college days, she snipped the spare button from the underside of the lapel. A tiny token from each, tucked into the pocket of her dress -- a gesture that would resurface in her youngest child years later, though Marilyn would never mention this small theft to Hannah, or to anyone. Not something treasured and loved; something they might miss but would not grieve. No need to tear another hole, even a pinprick, in their lives. Then Marilyn took her boxes from their hiding place in the attic and sat down to write James a note. But how did you write something like this? It seemed wrong to write to him on her stationery, as if he were a stranger; more wrong still to write it on the scratch pad in the kitchen, as if it were no more important than a grocery list. At last she pulled a blank sheet from the typewriter and sat down at her vanity with a pen.</div>
