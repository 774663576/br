<div class="line_en">In the last few days we have walked and walked. When the others want to stop and eat, Father keeps us moving. We have swum across rivers, pushed through trees, run across open ground and moved back into trees again. I know why -- we all know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在过去的几天里，我们东奔西走。当有成员想停下来吃东西时，鹿爸爸却让我们继续赶路。我们游过河流，穿过树林，奔过旷野，然后又回到树林。我知道这样赶路的原因——我们都知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's a wolf, or wolves, following us. It calls -- a long, hungry howling, often at night. It's following our smell. That's why Father tries to go through water as often as possible -- smells are lost in water.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="昨天出了点儿问题。鹿宝宝高高跃起，落到地上时轻轻尖叫了一声。它试着走步，然后又叫了一声，这一次叫声有些高。鹿妈妈跑到它跟前，鹿爸爸站在不远处观察。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brother, Baby and I often jump together, moving in sudden, high jumps across the ground. I'm beginning to understand why deer jump so much. A jump catches the eye of a wolf. When a wolf runs after a deer, another deer will jump and the wolf will turn to look at it. Then a third deer will jump. The wolf turns again. Each jump takes the deer away from the wolf and the wolf can't decide which deer to follow. It's clever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鹿哥哥、鹿宝宝和我经常一起跳跃，突然跑动、高高跳起、跃过地面。我开始了解为什么鹿总是在跳跃，跳跃能够吸引狼的注意。当狼紧追一只鹿时，另一只鹿跳起来，狼会转身去看。然后第三只鹿又跃起，狼又转过去看。每一跳都使另外的鹿离开狼更远，让狼不知道去追哪只鹿。这很聪明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I couldn't see what was wrong at first; Mother didn't want anyone to come near. In the end I lay down next to Baby and saw what it was -- a stick from a tree was deep inside Baby's leg and Mother's teeth couldn't pull it out. Mother didn't let me touch it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始我不知道怎么了。鹿妈妈不让任何人接近。最后我躺在鹿宝宝的身边，才看清怎么回事——一根树枝深深地插进了鹿宝宝的腿，鹿妈妈无法用牙齿把它拔出来。鹿妈妈不准我碰树枝。">查看中文翻译</div>
