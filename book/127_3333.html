<div class="line_en">On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin's side, aware that the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her, she had noticed very soon one little girl, about her own age, who looked at her very hard with a pair of light, rather dull, blue eyes. She was a fat child who did not look as if she were in the least clever, but she had a good-naturedly pouting mouth. Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she had pulled this pigtail around her neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, resting her elbows on the desk, as she stared wonderingly at the new pupil. When Monsieur Dufarge began to speak to Sara, she looked a little frightened; and when Sara stepped forward and, looking at him with the innocent, appealing eyes, answered him, without any warning, in French, the fat little girl gave a startled jump, and grew quite red in her awed amazement. Having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to remember that "la mere" meant "the mother," and "le pere," "the father," -- when one spoke sensible English -- it was almost too much for her suddenly to find herself listening to a child her own age who seemed not only quite familiar with these words, but apparently knew any number of others, and could mix them up with verbs as if they were mere trifles.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she attracted the attention of Miss Minchin, who, feeling extremely cross at the moment, immediately pounced upon her.</div>

<div class="line_en">So she took rather a fancy to fat, slow, little Miss St. John, and kept glancing toward her through the morning. She saw that lessons were no easy matter to her, and that there was no danger of her ever being spoiled by being treated as a show pupil. Her French lesson was a pathetic thing. Her pronunciation made even Monsieur Dufarge smile in spite of himself, and Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls either giggled or looked at her in wondering disdain. But Sara did not laugh. She tried to look as if she did not hear when Miss St. John called "le bon pain," "lee bong pang." She had a fine, hot little temper of her own, and it made her feel rather savage when she heard the titters and saw the poor, stupid, distressed child's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她有点儿爱上这个胖乎乎、慢吞吞的小姑娘圣约翰小姐了，一早晨都不住地瞅着她。萨拉明白功课对她来说并非易事，她是没有被当做可供炫耀的学生而被宠坏的危险的。她的法语课是桩伤脑筋的事。她的发音甚至使杜法奇先生不由自主地笑了，而拉维尼娅和杰西以及那些比较幸运的孩子，要么嗤嗤地笑她，要么就用诧异、蔑视的目光看着她。但萨拉不笑。当圣约翰小姐“新鲜面”这个词不读“le bon pai”而读“lee bong pan”时，她努力装作没有听见。她有她自己那种纯真的、火爆的小脾气，当她听到嗤嗤窃笑声，看见那可怜、呆笨、受尽折磨的孩子的脸时，会感到愤愤不平。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Upon which Miss St. John gave another jump, and when Lavinia and Jessie tittered she became redder than ever -- so red, indeed, that she almost looked as if tears were coming into her poor, dull, childish eyes; and Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began rather to like her and want to be her friend. It was a way of hers always to want to spring into any fray in which someone was made uncomfortable or unhappy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一喝，圣约翰小姐又吓了一跳，看到拉维尼娅和杰西在嗤嗤窃笑，她的脸更红了——的确是太红了，好像眼泪也涌现在她那可怜相的阴暗的带着孩子气的眼睛中。萨拉看在眼里，为她难过，竟觉得开始有点儿喜欢她了，想和她交朋友。当有人被弄得不快或不幸时，萨拉总是有点儿想打抱不平的气概。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Miss St. John!" she exclaimed severely. "What do you mean by such conduct? Remove your elbows! Take your ribbon out of your mouth! Sit up at once!"</div>

<div class="line_en">When lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups to talk, Sara looked for Miss St. John, and finding her bundled rather disconsolately in a window-seat, she walked over to her and spoke. She only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by way of beginning an acquaintance, but there was something friendly about Sara, and people always felt it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下课后，学生们三五成群聚集在一起谈话，萨拉寻找着圣约翰小姐，发现她忧郁地坐在窗槛座上，把身子抱成一团，便走上前去同她说话。她说的只不过是小姑娘们开始交往时彼此常说的那些话，但是她带着的亲切友好的态度，别人总是可以感觉到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It isn't funny, really," she said between her teeth, as she bent over her book. "They ought not to laugh."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“实在没有什么可笑的”她伏案看着书本，在齿间低声说“她们不应当笑”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To explain Miss St. John's amazement one must recall that a new pupil is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new pupil the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories. A new pupil with a carriage and a pony and a maid, and a voyage from India to discuss, was not an ordinary acquaintance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了解释圣约翰小姐的吃惊，你必须明白一个新学生在短期内是一种不安定因素；关于萨拉这个新学生，整个学校从前一天晚上就议论开了。谈论那些令人兴奋而互相矛盾的传闻，直讲到精疲力竭睡着为止。一个拥有一辆四轮马车、一匹矮种马和一名女仆的新学生，而且还是从印度远航而来，大可谈论，要结识这样一位新学生，可不是件寻常事啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If her Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing entirely when she had learned it, Ermengarde was strikingly like her. She was the monumental dunce of the school, and it could not be denied.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss St. John's chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father. Sometimes this seemed to her a dreadful calamity. If you have a father who knows everything, who speaks seven or eight languages, and has thousands of volumes which he has apparently learned by heart, he frequently expects you to be familiar with the contents of your lesson books at least; and it is not improbable that he will feel you ought to be able to remember a few incidents of history and to write a French exercise. Ermengarde was a severe trial to Mr. St. John. He could not understand how a child of his could be a notably and unmistakably dull creature who never shone in anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣约翰小姐生活中的主要烦恼就在于有个聪明的父亲。有时这对她来说似乎是个可怕的灾难。如果你有个无所不知的父亲，会讲七、八种外语，记得住成千册书的内容，他便会要求你至少熟悉课本的内容，也可能认为你应该记住一些历史事件，能做法语练习。对于圣约翰先生来说，埃芒加德是个十分令人头痛的问题。他弄不明白他的孩子怎么会是个明确无误的笨蛋，无论什么方面都不出色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara looked out of the window into the dingy square, where the sparrows were hopping and twittering on the wet, iron railings and the sooty branches of the trees. She reflected a few moments. She had heard it said very often that she was "clever," and she wondered if she was -- and IF she was, how it had happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉望着窗外晦暗的场院，那里有麻雀在潮湿的铁栏杆上和乌黑的树枝上蹦跳着、凋啾着。她沉思了一会儿。她常常听人家说“聪”，她怀疑自己是否聪明——如果真的聪明，那又是怎么一回事呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can speak it because I have heard it all my life," she answered. "You could speak it if you had always heard it."</div>

<div class="line_en">She was half laughing, but there was a touch of mysterious hope in her eyes which fascinated Ermengarde, though she had not the remotest idea what it meant, or whom it was she wanted to "catch," or why she wanted to catch her. Whatsoever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it was something delightfully exciting. So, quite thrilled with expectation, she followed her on tiptoe along the passage. They made not the least noise until they reached the door. Then Sara suddenly turned the handle, and threw it wide open. Its opening revealed the room quite neat and quiet, a fire gently burning in the grate, and a wonderful doll sitting in a chair by it, apparently reading a book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她微微一笑，但是眼睛里露出一点神秘的希望之光，这迷住了埃芒加德，虽然她压根儿不知道那是什么意思，萨拉“捉”谁，为什么要捉住她。无论萨拉是什么意思，埃芒加德深信那一定是什么令人快乐兴奋的事，于是满怀着期望，战战兢兢地踮起脚尖跟着萨拉沿过道走去。她俩悄然无声地来到门口。然后萨拉突然转动门把手，猛地将门打开。门敞开了，显露出室内十分整洁宁静，壁炉中的火徐徐燃烧着，旁边的椅子里坐着个出色非凡的洋娃娃，显然在看一本书。">查看中文翻译</div>

She drew her breath in so sharply that it made a funny, sad little sound, and then she shut her lips and held them tightly closed, as if she was determined either to do or NOT to do something. Ermengarde had an idea that if she had been like any other little girl, she might have suddenly burst out sobbing and crying. But she did not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，当她讲述寻觅埃米莉的经过时，埃芒加德看到她面色突变。似乎有一片阴云掠过她的脸，扑灭了明眸中的光芒。她急剧地抽了口气，发出一点儿稀奇的伤感声音，接着紧闭双唇，一直紧抿着，像在下决心要做或者不做什么事情似的。埃芒加德心中闪过一个念头，如果萨拉像其他任何小姑娘一样，可能早就突然一阵呜咽一阵啼泣了，但是萨拉没有这样做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have you a -- a pain?" Ermengarde ventured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你有点儿什么——什么痛苦吗”埃芒加德冒昧地问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ermengarde's mouth fell open a little. She knew that it would be far from behaving like a respectable child at a select seminary to say that it had never occurred to you that you COULD love your father, that you would do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in his society for ten minutes. She was, indeed, greatly embarrassed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃芒加德的嘴不禁张开了些。她知道在这所高级女童培育院里，你如果说出从来没有想到要爱父亲，并且为了避免陪伴父亲待十分钟，竟会做出任何不顾死活的事情，那你的表现就远不像是个富有教养的孩子了。的确，她感到很窘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," Sara answered, after a moment's silence. "But it is not in my body." Then she added something in a low voice which she tried to keep quite steady, and it was this: "Do you love your father more than anything else in all the whole world?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的”萨拉沉默片刻后回答“但是，那可不是在我的身子里”然后她又低声说了点儿什么，极力保持话音镇定，她说的是“比起世界上的任何东西，你更爱你的父亲吗”">查看中文翻译</div>
