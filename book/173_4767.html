<div class="line_en">The day dawned bleak and chill, a moving wall of gray light out of the northeast which, instead of dissolving into moisture, seemed to disintegrate into minute and venomous particles, like dust that, when Dilsey opened the door of the cabin and emerged, needled laterally into her flesh, precipitating not so much a moisture as a substance partaking of the quality of thin, not quite congealed oil. She wore a stiff black straw hat perched upon her turban, and a maroon velvet cape with a border of mangy and anonymous fur above a dress of purple silk, and she stood in the door for a while with her myriad and sunken face lifted to the weather, and one gaunt hand flac-soled as the belly of a fish, then she moved the cape aside and examined the bosom of her gown.</div>

<div class="line_en">The gown fell gauntly from her shoulders, across her fallen breasts, then tightened upon her paunch and fell again, ballooning a little above the nether garments which she would remove layer by layer as the spring accomplished and the warm days, in color regal and moribund. She had been a big woman once but now her skeleton rose, draped loosely in unpadded skin that tightened again upon a paunch almost dropsical, as though muscle and tissue had been courage or fortitude which the days or the years had consumed until only the indomitable skeleton was left rising like a ruin or a landmark above the somnolent and impervious guts, and above that the collapsed face that gave the impression of the bones themselves being outside the flesh, lifted into the driving day with an expression at once fatalistic and of a child's astonished disappointment, until she turned and entered the house again and closed the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那条长裙无精打采地从她双肩上耷拉下来，滑过她那对松垂的乳房，在她突出的腹部处绷紧。然后又松了开来，再往下又微微胀起，原来她在里面穿了好几条内裤。等春天过去，暖和的日子呈现出一派富丽堂皇、成熟丰收的色彩时，她会把内裤一条一条脱掉的。她原先是个又胖又大的女人，可是现在骨架都显露出来，上面松松地蒙着一层没有衬垫的皮，只是在肢胀似的肚子那里才重新绷紧，好象肌肉与组织都和勇气与毅力一样，会被岁月逐渐消磨殆尽似的。到如今只有那副百折不挠的骨架剩了下来，象一座废墟，也象一个里程碑，耸立在半死不活。麻木不仁的内脏之上，稍高处的那张脸让人感到仿佛骨头都翻到皮肉外面来了。那张脸如今仰向丽云在飞她的天空，脸上的表情既是听天由命的，又带有小孩子失望时的惊愕神情。最后，她终于转过身子，回进屋子，并且关上了门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The earth immediately about the door was bare. It had a patina, as though from the soles of bare feet in generations, like old silver or the walls of Mexican houses which have been plastered by hand. Beside the house, shading it in summer, stood three mulberry trees, the fledged leaves that would later be broad and placid as the palms of hands streaming flatly undulant upon the driving air. A pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere, whirled up on the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged in the mulberries, where they swung in raucous tilt and recover, screaming into the wind that ripped their harsh cries onward and away like scraps of paper or of cloth in turn. Then three more joined them and they swung and tilted in the wrung branches for a time, screaming. The door of the cabin opened and Dilsey emerged once more, this time in a man's felt hat and an army overcoat, beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress fell in uneven balloonings, streaming too about her as she crossed the yard and mounted the steps to the kitchen door.</div>

<div class="line_en">A moment later she emerged, carrying an open umbrella now, which she slanted ahead into the wind, and crossed to the woodpile and laid the umbrella down, still open. Immediately she caught at it and arrested it and held to it for a while, looking about her. Then she closed it and laid it down and stacked stovewood into her crooked arm, against her breast, and picked up the umbrella and got it open at last and returned to the steps and held the wood precariously balanced while she contrived to close the umbrella, which she propped in the corner just within the door. She dumped the wood into the box behind the stove. Then she removed the overcoat and hat and took a soiled apron down from the wall and put it on and built a fire in the stove. While she was doing so, rattling the grate bars and clattering the lids, Mrs Compson began to call her from the head of the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿她又出现了，这回拿了一把打开的伞。她迎风斜举着伞，穿过院子来到柴堆旁，把伞放下，伞答张着。马上她又朝伞扑去，抓住了伞，握在手里，朝四周望了一会儿。接着她把伞收拢，放下，将柴禾一根根放在弯着的臂弯里，堆在胸前，然后又拿起伞。好不容易才把伞打开，走回到台阶那儿，一边颤颤巍巍地平衡着不让柴禾掉下，同时费了不少劲把伞合上。最后她把伞支在门角落里。她让柴禾落进炉子后面的柴禾箱里，接着脱掉大衣和帽子，从墙上取下一条脏围裙，系在身上，这才开始生火。她把炉条通得嘎拉嘎拉直响，把护盖弄得啪哩啪啦直响。她这样干着的时候，康普生太太在楼梯口喊起她来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wore a dressing gown of quilted black satin, holding it close under her chin. In the other hand she held a red rubber hot water bottle and she stood at the head of the back stairway, calling "Dilsey" at steady and inflectionless intervals into the quiet stairwell that descended into complete darkness, then opened again where a gray window fell across it."Dilsey," she called, without inflection or emphasis or haste, as though she were not listening for a reply at all."Dilsey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="康普生太太穿着一件黑缎面的棉睡袍，用手把衣服在下巴底下捏紧，另外那只手拿着一只红胶皮的热水袋。她站在后楼梯的顶上，很有规律。毫无变化地一声声呼唤着“迪尔西”。她的声音传下枯井般的楼道，这楼道落入一片漆黑中，接着遇上从一扇灰暗的窗户里透进来的微光。“迪尔西，”她喊道，没有抑扬顿挫，没有重音，也一点不着急，好象她压根儿不期待回答似的。“迪尔西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yessum," Luster said. He returned and left by the diningroom door. After a while it ceased to flap. Dilsey prepared to make biscuit. As she ground the sifter steadily above the bread board, she sang, to herself at first, something without particular tune or words, repetitive, mournful and plaintive, austere, as she ground a faint, steady snowing of flour onto the bread board. The stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with murmurous minors of the fire, and presently she was singing louder, as if her voice too had been thawed out by the growing warmth, and then Mrs Compson called her name again from within the house. Dilsey raised her face as if her eyes could and did penetrate the walls and ceiling and saw the old woman in her quilted dressing gown at the head of the stairs, calling her name with machinelike regularity.</div>

She opened the oven and looked at the pan of bread, then stooping she paused while someone descended the stairs. She heard the feet cross the diningroom, then the swing door opened and Luster entered, followed by a big man who appeared to have been shaped of some substance whose particles would not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported it. His skin was dead looking and hairless; dropsical too, he moved with a shambling gait like a trained bear. His hair was pale and fine. It had been brushed smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in daguerrotypes. His eyes were clear, of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers, his thick mouth hung open, drooling a little.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“八点了，”迪尔西说。她停下手里的活，仰起了头在谛听。可是除了壁钟与炉火，一切都是沉寂无声的。她打开烤炉的门，看了看那一铁盘子面包皮。接着她腰弯着停住了动作，因为有人在下楼了。她听见有脚步声传过餐厅，接着弹簧门打开了，勒斯特走了进来，后面跟着一个大个子，这人身上的分子好象不愿或是不能粘聚在一起，也不愿或是不能与支撑身体的骨架粘聚似的。他的皮肤是死灰色的，光溜溜的不长胡 子；他还有点浮肿，走起路来趴手趴脚，象一只受过训练的熊。他的头发很细软，颜色很淡。头发平滑地从前额上披下，象早年的银版照片里小孩梳的童花头。他的眼睛很亮，是矢车菊那种讨人喜欢的浅蓝色。他的厚嘴唇张开着，稍稍有点淌口水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room grew warmer. Soon Dilsey's skin had taken on a rich, lustrous quality as compared with that as of a faint dusting of wood ashes which both it and Luster's had worn as she moved about the kitchen, gathering about her the raw materials of food, coordinating the meal. On the wall above a cupboard, invisible save at night, by lamp light and even then evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand, a cabinet clock ticked, then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat, struck five times.</div>

It was as if even eagerness were musclebound in him too, and hunger itself inarticulate, not knowing it is hunger. Luster fed him with skill and detachment. Now and then his attention would return long enough to enable him to feint the spoon and cause Ben to close his mouth upon the empty air, but it was apparent that Luster's mind was elsewhere. His other hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that dead surface it moved tentatively, delicately, as if he were picking an inaudible tune out of the dead void, and once he even forgot to tease Ben with the spoon while his fingers teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved arpeggio until Ben recalled him by whimpering again.</div>

It was not a girl's room. It was not anybody's room, and the faint scent of cheap cosmetics and the few feminine objects and the other evidences of crude and hopeless efforts to feminise it but added to its anonymity, giving it that dead and stereotyped transience of rooms in assignation houses. The bed had not been disturbed. On the floor lay a soiled undergarment of cheap silk a little too pink, from a half open bureau drawer dangled a single stocking. The window was open. A pear tree grew there, close against the house. It was in bloom and the branches scraped and rasped against the house and the myriad air, driving in the window, brought into the room the forlorn scent of the blossoms.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jason," Mrs Compson said."Where is he?" She went to the door. Dilsey followed her on down the hall, to another door. It was closed."Jason," she called through the door. There was no answer. She tried the knob, then she called him again. But there was still no answer, for he was hurling things backward out of the closet, garments, shoes, a suitcase. Then he emerged carrying a sawn section of tongue-andgroove planking and laid it down and entered the closet again and emerged with a metal box. He set it on the bed and stood looking at the broken lock while he dug a keyring from his pocket and selected a key, and for a time longer he stood with the selected key in his hand, looking at the broken lock. Then he put the keys back in his pocket and carefully tilted the contents of the box out upon the bed. Still carefully he sorted the papers, taking them up one at a time and shaking them. Then he upended the box and shook it too and slowly replaced the papers and stood again, looking at the broken lock, with the box in his hands and his head bent. Outside the window he heard some jaybirds swirl shrieking past and away, their cries whipping away along the wind, and an automobile passed somewhere and died away also. His mother spoke his name again beyond the door, but he didn't move. He heard Dilsey lead her away up the hall, and then a door closed. Then he replaced the box in the closet and flung the garments back into it and went down stairs to the telephone. While he stood there with the receiver to his ear waiting Dilsey came down the stairs. She looked at him, without stopping, and went on.</div>

It might have been the dry pulse of the decaying house itself, after a while it whirred and cleared its throat and struck six times.

<div class="line_en">"Hush up, looney," Luster said without turning."Look like we ain't gwine git to go to no church today." But Ben sat in the chair, his big soft hands dangling between his knees, moaning faintly. Suddenly he wept, a slow bellowing sound, meaningless and sustained."Hush," Luster said. He turned and lifted his hand."You want me to whup you?" But Ben looked at him, bellowing slowly with each expiration. Luster came and shook him."You hush dis minute!" he shouted."Here," he said. He hauled Ben out of the chair and dragged the chair around facing the stove and opened the door to the firebox and shoved Ben into the chair. They looked like a tug nudging at a clumsy tanker in a narrow dock. Ben sat down again facing the rosy door. He hushed. Then they heard the clock again, and Dilsey slow on the stairs. When she entered he began to whimper again. Then he lifted his voice.</div>

She came into the yard and called Luster. She waited a while, then she went to the house and around it to the cellar door, moving close to the wall, and looked into the door. Ben sat on the steps. Before him Luster squatted on the damp floor. He held a saw in his left hand, the blade sprung a little by pressure of his hand, and he was in the act of striking the blade with the worn wooden mallet with which she had been making beaten biscuit for more than thirty years. The saw gave forth a single sluggish twang that ceased with lifeless alacrity, leaving the blade in a thin clean curve between Luster's hand and the floor. Still, inscrutable, it bellied.</div>

On either hand the land dropped more sharply; a broad flat dotted with small cabins whose weathered roofs were on a level with the crown of the road.

What growth there was consisted of rank weeds and the trees were mulberries and locusts and sycamores -- trees that partook also of the foul desiccation which surrounded the houses; trees whose very burgeoning seemed to be the sad and stubborn remnant of September, as if even spring had passed them by, leaving them to feed upon the rich and unmistakable smell of negroes in which they grew.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most of the women were gathered on one side of the room. They were talking. Then the bell struck one time and they dispersed to their seats and the congregation sat for an instant, expectant. The bell struck again one time. The choir rose and began to sing and the congregation turned its head as one as six small children -- four girls with tight pigtails bound with small scraps of cloth like butterflies, and two boys with close napped heads -- entered and marched up the aisle, strung together in a harness of white ribbons and flowers, and followed by two men in single file. The second man was huge, of a light coffee color, imposing in a frock coat and white tie. His head was magisterial and profound, his neck rolled above his collar in rich folds. But he was familiar to them, and so the heads were still reverted when he had passed, and it was not until the choir ceased singing that they realised that the visiting clergyman had already entered, and when they saw the man who had preceded their minister enter the pulpit still ahead of him an indescribable sound went up, a sigh, a sound of astonishment and disappointment.</div>

They even forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which he ran and poised and swooped upon the cold inflectionless wire of his voice, so that at last, when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his monkey body as reft of all motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel, the congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a little in its seats.

<div class="line_en">"Brethren and sisteren," it said again. The preacher removed his arm and he began to walk back and forth before the desk, his hands clasped behind him, a meagre figure, hunched over upon itself like that of one long immured in striving with the implacable earth,"I got the recollection and the blood of the Lamb!" He tramped steadily back and forth beneath the twisted paper and the Christmas bell, hunched, his hands clasped behind him. He was like a worn small rock whelmed by the successive waves of his voice. With his body he seemed to feed the voice that, succubus like, had fleshed its teeth in him. And the congregation seemed to watch with its own eyes while the voice consumed him, until he was nothing and they were nothing and there was not even a voice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measures beyond the need for words, so that when he came to rest against the reading desk, his monkey face lifted and his whole attitude that of a serene, tortured crucifix that transcended its shabbiness and insignificance and made it of no moment, a long moaning expulsion of breath rose from them, and a woman's single soprano:"Yes, Jesus!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“弟兄们，姐妹们，”这声音又响起来了。牧师抽回手臂，开始在讲经桌前走来走去，双手反剪在背后，益发显得瘦小了，他身子低伛，象是个长期与这残酷的土地苦苦搏斗而被拴住在土地上的人。“我把羔羊①鲜血的事迹铭记在心！”他在扭成绞花形的彩纸和圣诞纸钟下面踏着重重的步子走来走去，低伛着身于，双手倒扣在背后。他很象一块被自己连续不断的声浪冲击得磨去了棱角的小石头。他也很象是在用肉身喂自己的声音，这声音象个魔女似的狰狩地咬啮着他的内心。会众们仿佛亲眼见到那声音在吞噬他，到后来他消失了，他们也消失了，甚至连他的声音也化为子虚乌有，只剩下他们的心在相互交 谈，用的是吟唱的节奏，无需借助活语，因此，当他终于又靠在讲经桌上喘口气时，他那张猴脸往上仰着，他的整个身姿很象十字架上那个圣洁、受苦的形象，脱去了原本的卑微猥琐的气质，好象那是一件完全无足轻重的事，这时，会众长长的出了一口气，发出了一阵呻吟，此外，还有一个妇女用尖细的声音喊了一句：“是的，耶稣！”（注：①《圣经·新约》中把耶稣称为“上帝的羔羊”；并认为可用”羊羊的血”把人的罪恶涤洗干净。）">查看中文翻译</div>

And he drove on out of the bells and out of town, thinking of himself slogging through the mud, hunting a team."And every damn one of them will be at church."

See if you can elect a man to office that can stop me," he said, thinking of himself entering the courthouse with a file of soldiers and dragging the sheriff out."Thinks he can sit with his hands folded and see me lose my job. I'll show him about jobs." Of his niece he did not think at all, nor of the arbitrary valuation of the money.

From time to time he passed churches, unpainted frame buildings with sheet iron steeples, surrounded by tethered teams and shabby motorcars, and it seemed to him that each of them was a picketpost where the rear guards of Circumstance peeped fleetingly back at him."And damn You, too," he said."See if You can stop me," thinking of himself, his file of soldiers with the manacled sheriff in the rear, dragging Omnipotence down from his throne, if necessary; of the embattled legions of both hell and heaven through which he tore his way and put his hands at last on his fleeing niece.</div>

It seemed that he could feel the prolonged blow of it sinking through his skull, and suddenly with an old premonition he clapped the brakes on and stopped and sat perfectly still. Then he lifted his hand to his neck and began to curse, and sat there, cursing in a harsh whisper. When it was necessary for him to drive for any length of time he fortified himself with a handkerchief soaked in camphor, which he would tie about his throat when clear of town, thus inhaling the fumes, and he got out and lifted the seat cushion on the chance that there might be a forgotten one there. He looked beneath both seats and stood again for a while, cursing, seeing himself mocked by his own triumphing. He closed his eyes, leaning on the door. He could return and get the forgotten camphor, or he could go on. In either case, his head would be splitting, but at home he could be sure of finding camphor on Sunday, while if he went on he could not be sure. But if he went back, he would be an hour and a half later in reaching Mottson."Maybe I can drive slow," he said."Maybe I can drive slow, thinking of something else…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Two gaudily painted pullman cars stood on the track. He reconnoitred them before he got out. He was trying to breathe shallowly, so that the blood would not beat so in his skull. He got out and went along the station wall, watching the cars. A few garments hung out of the windows, limp and crinkled, as though they had been recently laundered. On the earth beside the steps of one sat three canvas chairs. But he saw no sign of life at all until a man in a dirty apron came to the door and emptied a pan of dishwater with a broad gesture, the sunlight glinting on the metal belly of the pan, then entered the car again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有两节漆得花里胡 哨的普尔曼式卧车停靠在一条铁轨上。他走出汽车之前先把它们打量了一番。他努力使自己的呼吸浅一些，好让血液不在他的头颅里搏击得那么猛烈。他钻出汽车，沿着车站的围墙走着，一边观察着那些卧车。车窗外挂着几件外农，软疲疲、皱巴巴的，象是最近刚刚洗过。一节车厢的踏脚板旁的地上放着三张帆布折椅。可是他没见到有人的迹象，过了一会，才看见有一个系着条脏围裙的汉子走到车门口，大大咧咧地把一锅脏水往外泼去，使金属的锅肚子反射出太陽光，接着，那汉子又回进车厢去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He crested the final hill. Smoke lay in the valley, and roofs, a spire or two above trees. He drove down the hill and into the town, slowing, telling himself again of the need for caution, to find where the tent was located first. He could not see very well now, and he knew that it was the disaster which kept telling him to go directly and get something for his head. At a filling station they told him that the tent was not up yet, but that the show cars were on a siding at the station. He drove there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他爬上了最后的一个小山包皮。烟雾弥漫在山谷、屋顶和树丛里露出来的一两个尖塔之间。他朝山下驶去，开进了镇子，放慢速度，一边再次告诫自己千万要小心，首先是要找到那座大帐篷揩在何处。他的眼睛现在看不大清、他知道是那场灾祸在不断命令他径直地往前冲，同时给自己的脑袋找点什么治一治。在一处加油站上，人家告诉他演戏的帐篷还没有支起来，不过那几辆戏班子的专车正停靠在车站的旁轨上。于是他便朝那儿驶去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now I'll have to take him by surprise, before he can warn them, he thought. It never occurred to him that they might not be there, in the car. That they should not be there, that the whole result should not hinge on whether he saw them first or they saw him first, would be opposed to all nature and contrary to the whole rhythm of events.

Only maybe he hit me a long time ago, he thought, And I just now felt it, and he thought Hurry. Hurry.

A clumsy, hurried blow, and not hard, but the other slumped immediately and slid clattering among pans and buckets to the floor. Jason stood above him, panting, listening. Then he turned and ran from the car. At the door he restrained himself and descended more slowly and stood there again. His breath made a hah hah hah sound and he stood there trying to repress it, darting his gaze this way and that, when at a scuffling sound behind him he turned in time to see the little old man leaping awkwardly and furiously from the vestibule, a rusty hatchet high in his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你先别动，让我下去，怎么样？”他说，“干不干？”可是那人还在死命挣扎，杰生只好腾出一只手，朝他头上捶了一拳。这一拳打得笨笨拙拙，匆匆忙忙，不算太重，可是对方已经一下子瘫倒下去，倒在一大堆锅碗瓢盆之间，发出了好一阵磐铃哐啷的响声。杰生气喘吁吁地俯身在他的上面，谛听着。接着他转过身子匆匆朝车厢外跑去。跑到车门伺，他抑制住自己，放慢了速度爬下蹬梯，在那儿又站了一会儿。他的呼吸变成了一种哈哧、哈哧、哈哧的声音，他站住了想让自己气儿出得顺当些，一面眼光朝这边那边扫来扫去。这时一阵杂乱的脚步声从他背后传来，他赶紧扭过头去，看见那小老头趔趔趄趄、火冒三丈地从车厢回过道里蹦跳下来，手里高高的举着一把生锈的斧子。">查看中文翻译</div>

I can get something for it at Jefferson, he told himself, easing himself to the jolting, I can get something there. They drove on, along the streets where people were turning peacefully into houses and Sunday dinners, and on out of town. He thought that. He wasn't thinking of home, where Ben and Luster were eating cold dinner at the kitchen table. Something -- the absence of disaster, threat, in any constant evil -- permitted him to forget Jefferson as any place which he had ever seen before, where his life must resume itself.</div>

She returned through the kitchen and out the outer door and stopped on the steps. Ben and Luster were not in sight, but while she stood there she heard another sluggish twang from the direction of the cellar door and she went to the door and looked down upon a repetition of the morning's scene.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, don't you git started," Luster said."I had enough trouble wid you today." There was a hammock made of barrel staves slatted into woven wires. Luster lay down in the swing, but Ben went on vaguely and purposelessly. He began to whimper again."Hush, now," Luster said."I fixin to whup you." He lay back in the swing. Ben had stopped moving, but Luster could hear him whimpering."Is you gwine hush, er ain't you?" Luster said. He got up and followed and came upon Ben squatting before a small mound of earth. At either end of it an empty bottle of blue glass that once contained poison was fixed in the ground. In one was a withered stalk of jimson weed. Ben squatted before it, moaning, a slow, inarticulate sound. Still moaning he sought vaguely about and found a twig and put it in the other bottle."Whyn't you hush?" Luster said."You want me to give you somethin to sho nough moan about? Sposin I does dis." He knelt and swept the bottle suddenly up and behind him. Ben ceased moaning. He squatted, looking at the small depression where the bottle had sat, then as he drew his lungs full Luster brought the bottle back into view."Hush!" he hissed."Don't you dast to beller! Don't you. Dar hit is. See? Here. You fixin to start ef you stays here. Come on, les go see ef dey started knockin ball yit." He took Ben's arm and drew him up and they went to the fence and stood side by side there, peering between the matted honeysuckle not yet in bloom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ben quit whimpering. He sat in the middle of the seat, holding the repaired flower upright in his fist, his eyes serene and ineffable. Directly before him Luster's bullet head turned backward continually until the house passed from view, then he pulled to the side of the street and while Ben watched him he descended and broke a switch from a hedge. Queenie lowered her head and fell to cropping the grass until Luster mounted and hauled her head up and harried her into motion again, then he squared his elbows and with the switch and the reins held high he assumed a swaggering attitude out of all proportion to the sedate clopping of Queenie's hooves and the organlike basso of her internal accompaniment. Motors passed them, and pedestrians; once a group of half grown negroes:</div>

<div class="line_en">With a backhanded blow he hurled Luster aside and caught the reins and sawed Queenie about and doubled the reins back and slashed her across the hips. He cut her again and again, into a plunging gallop, while Ben's hoarse agony roared about them, and swung her about to the right of the monument. Then he struck Luster over the head with his fist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他手背一挥，把勒斯特推到一边去，一把抓住缰绳，把它一收一放，又把缰绳弯进一段，用它来抽“小王后”的屁股。他抽了一下又一下，它一颠一颠地飞跑起来，这时班的吼叫声还在他们耳边直晌，他就驾着马让它从纪念碑的右面拐弯。这以后他朝勒斯特头上揍了一拳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For an instant Ben sat in an utter hiatus. Then he bellowed. Bellow on bellow, his voice mounted, with scarce interval for breath. There was more than astonishment in it, it was horror; shock; agony eyeless, tongueless; just sound, and Luster's eyes backrolling for a white instant."Gret God," he said."Hush! Hush! Gret God!" He whirled again and struck Queenie with the switch. It broke and he cast it away and with Ben's voice mounting toward its unbelievable crescendo Luster caught up the end of the reins and leaned forward as Jason came jumping across the square and onto the step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起先，班一动不动地坐在马车上，仿佛是一片空白。接着，他大声地吼叫起来。①一声紧接一声，声音越来越响，而且简直不留喘气的间隙。声音里所包皮含的不仅仅是惊愕，而且也有恐怖、震惊，是一种没有外形、不可言状的痛苦，它只是一种声音，于是勒斯特眼珠乱转，有一瞬间眼眶里全部是眼白。“老天爷呀，”他说，“别叫了，别叫了！好老天！”他扭回身去，用树枝抽了“小王后”一下。树枝断了，他把它扔掉，这时班的声音越来越大，越来越高，到了令人难以置信的地步。勒斯特干脆身体前俯，勒紧缰绳，这时杰生边跳边跑地穿过广场，踩上了马车的蹬级。（注：①据喀尔文·布朗的《福克纳的南方词汇》一书解释，南方每一个县城都有一座南方联盟纪念碑。福克纳的故乡奥克斯福的那座是一个南方联盟士兵的雕像，座落在法院前的广场上。小说中，班吉每星期坐T．P．赶的马车上墓地去，都从雕像右边拐弯。这一次勒斯特驾车从雕像左面转弯，故而引起班的情绪激动。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't you know any better than to take him to the left?" he said. He reached back and struck Ben, breaking the flower stalk again."Shut up!" he said."Shut up!" He jerked Queenie back and jumped down."Get to hell on home with him. If you ever cross that gate with him again, I'll kill you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么这么傻，让班吉从左边走？”他说。他弯过身去打班，把班的花茎又弄折了。“闭嘴！”他说，“给我闭嘴！”他勒住“小王后”跳下车来。“快带了他滚回去。要是你再带他走出大门，瞧我不宰了你！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ben's voice roared and roared. Queenie moved again, her feet began to clop-clop steadily again, and at once Ben hushed. Luster looked quickly back over his shoulder, then he drove on. The broken flower drooped over Ben's fist and his eyes were empty and blue and serene again as cornice and facade flowed smoothly once more from left to right, post and tree, window and doorway and signboard each in its ordered place.</div>
