<div class="line_en">It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley of Rivendell, where stood the Last (or the First) Homely House. Again it was evening, their ponies were tired, especially the one that carried the baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path, Bilbo heard the elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not stopped since he left; and as soon as the riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a song of much the same kind as before. This is something like it:</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water to the house of Elrond. There a warm welcome was made them, and there were many eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know came in.</div>

<div class="line_en">The return of Mr. Bilbo Baggins created quite a disturbance, both under the Hill and over the Hill, and across the Water; it was a great deal more than a nine days' wonder. The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr. Baggins was in fact admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the Sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture. Many of his silver spoons mysteriously disappeared and were never accounted for. Personally he suspected the Sackville-Bagginses. On their side they never admitted that the returned Baggins was genuine, and they were not on friendly terms with Bilbo ever after. They really had wanted to live in his nice hobbit-hole so very much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博·巴金斯先生的归来在小丘下边、小丘那边和小河对面都造成了相当大的骚动。这可不光是一场为期九天的轰动，法律上的争议甚至持续了好几年。事实上，巴金斯先生又过了好久才重新被承认还活着。对于那些在拍卖中买到了便宜货的人们，比尔博花了不少口舌让他们把东西退回来，到后来为了节省时间，比尔博只能掏钱买回了许多他自己的家具。好多银汤匙都神秘失踪，也没人对此作出解释。比尔博个人怀疑这是萨克维尔—巴金斯一家干的。他们一直也没有承认归来的比尔博是货真价实的，从那之后也一直和比尔博处得不太融洽，这都是因为他们太想要住进比尔博的洞府的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Indeed Bilbo found he had lost more than spoons-he had lost his reputation. It is true that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no longer quite respectable. He was in fact held by all the hobbits of the neighbourhood to be 'queer' -- except by his nephews and nieces on the Took side, but even they were not encouraged in their friendship by their elders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可比尔博失落的还不只是汤匙呢，他连好名声都弄丢了。在那之后，他的确一直是精灵之友，而且凡是从那里经过的矮人与巫师之类都对他敬仰有加，但他在当地的确不再那么受人尊敬了。住在附近的霍比特人都认为他“古怪”——除了他图克家那边的外甥和外甥女们，不过，就连他们，家中的长辈也都劝他们要对这位舅舅敬而远之。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study writing his memoirs-he thought of calling them "There and Back Again, a Hobbit's Holiday" -- when there was a ring at the door. It was Gandalf and a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几年后，一个秋天的晚上，比尔博正坐在书房里写回忆录（他想将其命名为《去而复返一个霍比特人的假期》），突然门口传来了门铃声。来访者是甘道夫和一位矮人，实际上那位矮人正是巴林。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am sorry to say he did not mind. He was quite content; and the sound of the kettle on his hearth was ever after more musical than it had been even in the quiet days before the Unexpected Party. His sword he hung over the mantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on a stand in the hall (until he lent it to a Museum). His gold and silver was largely spent in presents, both useful and extravagant-which to a certain extent accounts for the affection of his nephews and his nieces. His magic ring he kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when unpleasant callers came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过他对此并不在乎。他对自己的生活相当满意，他家炉子上水壶发出的烧水声，甚至比当年那群不速之客来造访前他过着平静生活时的更加悦耳动听。他的宝剑挂在壁炉上，盔甲则挂在厅里的一个架子上（后来借给了一家博物馆）。他通过冒险得来的金银大都花在购买礼物上，这些礼物既有很实用的，也有很奢侈的——这在一定程度上也能解释他的外甥和外甥女们为什么这么喜欢他。他的魔戒他对谁都瞒着，他主要用它来躲开那些不愿意见的客人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took to writing poetry and visiting the elves; and though many shook their heads and touched their foreheads and said "Poor old Baggins!" and though few believed any of his tales, he remained very happy to the end of his days, and those were extraordinarily long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开始写起了诗歌，还不时拜访精灵。虽然许多人提到他的时候，都会摇着头，拍拍脑门儿，叹一声“可怜的老巴金斯”，而且也没有多少人相信他的故事，可他还是一辈子都活得快快乐乐，而且还是特别长的一辈子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come in! Come in!" said Bilbo, and soon they were settled in chairs by the fire. If Balin noticed that Mr. Baggins' waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that Balin's beard was several inches longer, and his jewelled belt was of great magnificence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快进来！快进来！”比尔博热情招呼道，没多久他们就在壁炉边落座。如果说巴林注意到了巴金斯先生的背心显得更宽大了（还有真金扣子），那么比尔博也注意到巴林的胡子又长了好几寸，而他那镶着珠宝的腰带也无比耀眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They fell to talking of their times together, of course, and Bilbo asked how things were going in the lands of the Mountain. It seemed they were going very well. Bard had rebuilt the town in Dale and men had gathered to him from the Lake and from South and West, and all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much wealth went up and down the Running River; and there was friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谈着谈着，话题便自然落到了过去共度的时光，比尔博又问起孤山周边的地区近况如何，从巴林的回答听来一切似乎都发展得很顺利：巴德已经重建了河谷城，人们从长湖镇，以及南方和西方来跟随他，整座山谷又得到了耕作，重新变得兴旺起来，原先的荒地现在到了春天便充满鸟语花香，到了秋天便瓜果飘香。长湖镇也完成了重建，繁华更胜往昔，奔流河上往来着大量的财货，那些地方的精灵、矮人和人类都建立起了真诚的友谊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old Master had come to a bad end. Bard had given him much gold for the help of the Lake-people, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease he fell under the dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and died of starvation in the Waste, deserted by his companions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老镇长的下场很不好，巴德给了他很多的黄金，请他用来帮助长湖镇的人民，但是，由于他是很容易疑神疑鬼的人，住在那里他总是害怕恶龙会作祟，于是便卷了大部分金子潜逃了，最后被与他同行的人抛弃，活活饿死在了荒野中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The new Master is of wiser kind," said Balin, "and very popular, for, of course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold."</div>

You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole bene-fit? You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!"</div>
