<div class="line_en">But it was to be nearly another year before Don Corleone could arrange for his son Michael to be smuggled back into the United States. During that time the whole Family racked their brains for suitable schemes. Even Carlo Rizzi was listened to now that he was living in the mall with Connie. (During that time they had a second child, a boy.) But none of the schemes met with the Don's approval.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally it was the Bocchicchio Family who through a misfortune of its own solved the problem. There was one Bocchicchio, a young cousin of no more than twenty-five years of age, named Felix, who was born in America and with more brains than anyone in the clan had ever had before. He had refused to be drawn into the Family garbage hauling business and married a nice American girl of English stock to further his split from the clan. He went to school at night, to become a lawyer, and worked during the day as a civil service post office clerk. During that time he had three children but his wife was a prudent manager and they lived on his salary until he got his law degree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，卜启丘家族因遇到了一件不幸的事而将计就计，才帮着解决了问题。卜启丘有一个不满二十五岁的堂弟，名叫斐力克斯，是在美国生的，很有头脑，比这个家族中的任何人都要聪明一些。他拒不卷入他的家族所经营的垃圾搬运业。为了进一步同他的家族划清界线，他同一个英国血统的漂亮的美国姑娘结婚了。他想当律师，晚上去上夜班，白天就到邮局去上班，身份是通过考试录用的邮局职员。在这期间，他已经有了三十孩子，但是他老婆是个勤俭持家的能手，他们一家入就靠他当职员的薪水生活，直到他取得法学学位。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Felix Bocchicchio, like many young men, thought that having struggled to complete his education and master the tools of his profession, his virtue would automatically be rewarded and he would earn a decent living. This proved not to be the case. Still proud, he refused all help from his clan. But a lawyer friend of his, a young man well connected and with a budding career in a big law firm, talked Felix into doing him a little favor. It was very complicated, seemingly legal, and had to do with a bankruptcy fraud. It was a million-to-one shot against its being found out. Felix Bocchicchio took the chance. Since the fraud involved using the legal skills he had learned in a university, it seemed not so reprehensible, and, in an odd way, not even criminal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，斐力克斯·卜启丘同许多年轻人一样，天真地认为，他经过奋斗，已经完成了学业，掌握了他那个专业的基本技能，他那勤奋好学的精神应该自然而然地得到报偿，也就是说，他会过上体面的生活。实践证明这种想法根本不切实际。他仍然放不下架子，拒绝了自己家族的一切帮助。不过，他有一个律师朋友，这个律师是一个神通广大的年轻人，在一个很大的律师联合事务所工作，很有发展前途。盲一天，他死气白赖地硬要斐力克斯给帮个小忙。问题非常复杂，表面上是合法的，实际上涉及到一桩破产骗局，这种骗局被揭穿的可能性也只有万分之一。斐力克斯·卜启丘想碰碰运气。这种骗局，要运用一些他当年在大学学到的法律手续上的技巧，表面上看来即使犯法也下大，孤立起来，甚至根本不算犯法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To make a foolish story short, the fraud was discovered. The lawyer friend refused to help Felix in any manner, refused to even answer his telephone calls. The two principals in the fraud, shrewd middle-aged businessmen who furiously blamed Felix Bocchicchio's legal clumsiness for the plan going awry, pleaded guilty and cooperated with the state, naming Felix Bocchicchio as the ringleader of the fraud and claiming he had used threats of violence to control their business and force them to cooperate with him in his fraudulent schemes. Testimony was given that linked Felix with uncles and cousins in the Bocchiochio clan who had criminal records for strong-arm, and this evidence was damning. The two businessmen got off with suspended sentences. Felix Bocchiochio was given a sentence of one to five years and served three of them. The clan did not ask help from any of the Families or Don Corleone because Felix had refused to ask their help and had to be taught a lesson: that mercy comes only from the Family, that the Family is more loyal and more to be trusted than society.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不妨把这个蠢人的事情说得扼要一些：骗局被揭穿了，那个法律界的朋友拒绝以任何方式帮助斐力克斯，甚至斐力克斯打去的电话也不接。这桩骗局里的两个主犯是两个精明的中年商人，在计划出了纰漏之后，对斐力克斯·卜启丘大发雷霆，骂他是蠢材，然后他们两个坦白服罪了，井同官方合作，指责斐力克斯·卜启丘是骗局的主谋，诬陷他曾经使用暴力威胁控制了他们的企业讲强迫他们执行他拟定的讹诈计划。证据也提供出来了，把韭力克斯同他们家中那些早先犯有使用暴力罪，并记录在案的伯伯叔叔、堂兄弟、表兄弟联系在一起了，凭这个证据就足以定罪。那两个商人被判为缓刑而逍遥法外。斐力克斯·卜启丘被判为一至五年徒刑，结果服刑三年。卜启丘家族没有向任何家族要求帮助，也没有向考利昂老头子要求帮助，因为斐力克斯拒绝他们帮助。他也实在应该受到一点教训，让他明白，照顾只能来自家族，家族比社会更加忠诚可靠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In any case, Felix Bocchicchio was released from prison after serving three years, went home and kissed his wife and three children and lived peacefully for a year, and then showed that he was of the Bocchicchio clan after all. Without any attempt to conceal his guilt, he procured a weapon, a pistol, and shot his lawyer friend to death. He then searched out the two businessmen and calmly shot them both through the head as they came out of a luncheonette. He left the bodies lying in the street and went into the luncheonette and ordered a cup of coffee which he drank while he waited for the police to come and arrest him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在服刑三年之后，斐力克斯·卜启丘总算给放出来了。他回到家里，吻了吻自己的老婆和三个孩子，随后在家里安安静静地住了一年，最后表明，他毕竟还是卜启丘家族的子孙后代。他居然明目张胆，并不隐瞒自己的罪行，公开地搞到一件武器——一支手枪。把他那个律师朋友打死了。他然后又找到了那两个商人，等他们从便餐馆出来的时候，他态度冷静地开枪打穿了他们的脑壳，把他们干掉了。他让那两具尸体躺在大街上，自己走进便餐馆要了一杯咖啡。他一面喝咖啡，一面等待着警察来逮捕他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His trial was swift and his judgment merciless. A member of the criminal underworld had cold bloodedly murdered state witnesses who had sent him to the prison he richly deserved. It was a flagrant flouting of society and for once the public, the press, the structure of society and even soft-headed and soft-hearted humanitarians were united in their desire to see Felix Bocchicchio in the electric chair. The governor of the state would no more grant him clemency than the officials of the pound spare a mad dog, which was the phrase of one of the governor's closest political sides. The Bocchiochio clan of course would spend whatever money was needed for appeals to higher courts, they were proud of him now, but the conclusion was certain. After the legal folderol, which might take a little time, Felix Bocchicchio would die in the electric chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对他的审判进行得很快，判决是严厉的。罪恶的地下世界的一个成员，心不惊、肉不跳地谋杀了同政府合作的两个见证人。这两个见证人把他送进了监牢，而他坐牢实在是罪有应得。这对社会是一种明目张胆的嘲笑。民众、报界、整个社会组织体系，甚至一向心慈手软的人道主义者都一致要求把斐力克斯·卜启丘送上电椅，处以电刑。负责捕捉无执照或无主人的家畜的官员下去放过一条疯狗，州长也更不会宽容他。这是州长的一位最亲密的助手所说的。卜启丘家族为了向法院上诉，随便需要花多少钱都愿意。他们如今为他感到自豪，但是结论是确定无疑的。斐力克斯·卜启丘要死在电椅里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Hagen who brought this case to the attention of the Don at the request of one of the Bocchiochios who hoped that something could be done for the young man. Don Codeone curtly refused. He was not a magician. People asked him the impossible. But the next day the Don called Hagen into his office and had him go over the case in the most intimate detail. When Hagen was finished, Don Corleone told him to summon the head of the Bocchicchio clan to the mall for a meeting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在卜启已家族中的一个成员的要求之下，黑根把这个案件提出来，请老头子考虑。卜启丘家族希望尽量能力年轻人出一把力。考利昂老头子断然拒绝了。他并不是魔术师，人家要求的是一件他不可能办到的事。但是，第二天老头子把黑根叫到自己的办公室，要他极其深入细致地研究一下这个案情。黑根完成任务之后，考利昂老头子要他通知卜启丘家族的头头到林荫道来谈一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What happened next had the simplicity of genius. Don Corleone guaranteed to the head of the Bocchicchio clan that the wife and children of Felix Bocchicchio would be rewarded with a handsome pension. The money for this would be handed over to the Bocchicchio clan immediately. In turn, Felix must confess to the murder of Sollozzo and the police captain McCluskey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天的事情办得干脆利落，充分体现了天才的快刀斩乱麻的特色。考利昂老头子向卜启丘家族的头头保证，斐力克斯·卜启丘的妻子儿女可以得到一大笔抚恤金。这一大笔钱可以立即交付给卜启丘家族。交换条件是：斐力克斯必须坦白承认，是他谋杀了索洛佐和上尉警官麦克罗斯基。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were many details to be arranged. Felix Bocchicchio would have to confess convincingly, that is, he would have to know some of the true details to confess to. Also he must implicate the police captain in narcotics. Then the waiter at the Luna Restaurant must be persuaded to identify Felix Bocchiochio as the murderer. This would take some courage, as the description would change radically, Felix Bocchicchio being much shorter and heavier. But Don Corleone would attend to that. Also since the condemned man had been a great believer in higher education and a college graduate, he would want his children to go to college. And so a sum of money would have to be paid by Don Corleone that would take care of the children's college. Then the Bocchicchio clan had to be reassured that there was no hope for clemency on the original murders. The new confession of course would seal the man's already almost certain doom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有许多细节有待安排，到时候，斐力克斯·卜启丘必须坦白得令人信服，也就是说，他必须事前熟悉准备要坦白的一些真实细节。另外，他还必须把那个上尉警官牵连到麻醉剂走私活动里去，还有月亮饭店的那个堂倌，必须加以说服，要他把斐力克斯·卜启丘认作谋杀犯。这可需要一点勇气才行，因为这涉及到对犯人的描述必须大大改变。斐力克斯·卜启丘这个人比较起来要矮得多，胖得多。但是，考利昂老头子会解决这个问题。此外，这个被判死刑的人是个非常迷信高等教育的人，是一个大学毕业生，因此他会希望他的子女也能够上大学。这样，考利昂老头子就还得付出一笔钱，准备用以供那几个孩子上大学。再接着，还必须向卜启丘家族一再解释清楚，谋杀了三十人，要求从宽处理是根本没有希望的。新的坦白，就等于在犯人原来几乎确定的死刑判决书上签名盖章。">查看中文翻译</div>

Finally the plan was sprung and the confession made headlines in all the newspapers. The whole thing was a huge success.
