<div class="line_en">There Is no denying it was a beast of a day. Overhead was a sunless sky, muffled in clouds that were heavy with snow; underfoot, a black frost; blowing over it, a wind that felt as if it would take your skin off. When they got down into the plain they found that this part of the ancient road was much more ruinous than any they had yet seen. They had to pick their way over great broken stones and between boulders and across rubble: hard going for sore feet. And, however tired they got, it was far too cold for a halt.</div>

<div class="line_en">At about ten o'clock the first tiny snow flakes came loitering down and settled on Jill's arm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground was noticeably white. And by the end of half an hour a good steady snowstorm, which looked as if it meant to last all day, was driving in their faces so that they could hardly see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约十点左右，第一阵小雪花慢慢飘下来了，正落在吉尔的手臂上。十分钟以后，雪就密密麻麻漫天飞舞。过了二十分钟，大地明显成了银白世界。过了半小时，来了一场持续不断的暴风雪，看样子要下个一整天，暴风雪扑面而来，他们几乎什么也看不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In order to understand what followed, you must keep on remembering how little they could see. As they drew near the low hill which separated them from the place where the lighted windows had appeared, they had no general view of it at all. It was a question of seeing the next few paces ahead, and, even for that, you had to screw up your eyes. Needless to say, they were not talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了弄清接下来发生的事，你们一定要记住，他们几乎什么也看不见了。当他们走近低矮的小山时，那座小山把昨天晚上窗户亮着灯的那地方挡住了，所以他们一点也看不见。只看得见前面几步路的地方，即使这么着，也还得眯起眼睛。不用说，他们大家都不说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they reached the foot of the hill they caught a glimpse of what might be rocks on each side -- squarish rocks, if you looked at them carefully, but no one did. All were more concerned with the ledge right in front of them which barred their way. It was about four feet high. The Marsh-wiggle, with his long legs, had no difficulty in jumping onto the top of it, and he then helped the others up. It was a nasty wet business for them, though not for him, because the snow now lay quite deep on the ledge. They then had a stiff climb -- Jill fell once -- up very rough ground for about a hundred yards, and came to a second ledge. There were four of these ledges altogether, at quite irregular intervals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他们到达山脚下，他们往两边那些可能是岩石的东西看了一眼——仔细瞧瞧的话，就知道这是近似方形的岩石，但谁也没好好看。大家更关心的是正前方挡住他们路的那块突出的石头。约有四英尺高。沼泽怪腿长，毫不费力就跳了上去，接着就帮另外两个上来。对他们两个来说，爬上去弄得湿漉漉可真够呛，因为那块石头上的积雪已经很深了，不过沼泽怪倒不当一回事。后来他们又在崎岖不平的地上往上爬了大约一百码——吉尔还摔下来一回——才爬上第二块突出的石头。一共有四块这种石头，距离都不相等。，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they struggled on to the fourth ledge, there was no mistaking the fact that they were now at the top of the flat hill. Up till now the slope had given them some shelter; here, they got the full fury of the wind. For the hill, oddly enough, was quite as flat on top as it had looked from a distance: a great level tableland which the storm tore across without resistance. In most places the snow was still hardly lying at all, for the wind kept catching it up off the ground in sheets and clouds, and hurling it in their faces. And round their feet little eddies of snow ran about as you sometimes see them doing over ice. And, indeed, in many places, the surface was almost as smooth as ice. But to make matters worse it was crossed and crisscrossed with curious banks or dykes, which sometimes divided it up into squares and oblongs. All these of course had to be climbed; they varied from two to five feet in height and were about a couple of yards thick. On the north side of each bank the snow already lay in deep drifts; and after each climb you came down into a drift and got wet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们好不容易才爬上了第四块石头，事实摆明他们这会儿已经在这扁平的小山顶上了。到现在为止，那山坡总算给了他们个避风的地方；在这儿，他们可领教了暴风的威力。说也奇怪，这座小山顶上居然相当平坦，就跟在远处看时一样。暴风就在这一大片高地上无遮无拦地呼啸而过。多半地方仍然不大有积雪，因为风不断把雪卷离地面，成片成团地抛到他们脸上。还有一股股风雪交加的小旋涡在他们脚边打转转，就像有时候看到暴风雪刮过冰上那样。而多地方的表面确实也像冰一样光溜溜。但更糟的是，这地方还布满了纵横交错、奇奇怪怪的堤坝，把这地方分割成一块块正方形和长方形。所有这些堤坝当然都要爬上去，高度从二英尺到五英尺不等，厚度也有两三码。每道堤坝的北侧都已积起厚厚的雪；每爬过一道堤坝，就陷到积雪里，弄得浑身湿漉漉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly she skidded, slid about five feet, and found herself to her horror sliding down into a dark, narrow chasm which seemed that moment to have appeared in front of her. Half a second later she had reached the bottom. She appeared to be in a kind of trench or groove, only about three feet wide. And though she was shaken by the fall, almost the first thing she noticed was the relief of being out of the wind; for the walls of the trench rose high above her. The next thing she noticed was, naturally, the anxious faces of Scrubb and Puddleglum looking down at her from the edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然她脚下一滑，就此滑出去约有五英尺，她发现自己滑进了一个又黑又狭的坑，不由吓得半死。这坑似乎刚刚出现在她眼前，转眼间，她已滑到底了。她似乎是掉在沟沟槽槽之类的里边了，只有三英尺宽。虽然这次摔倒使她大为震惊，但她首先注意到的就是吹不到风了，总算松了口气，因为沟壁比她高出一截。其次她注意到的，自然是斯克罗布和普德格伦那两张焦急的脸正从沟边上往下望着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fighting her way forward with hood up and head down and numb hands inside her cloak, Jill had glimpses of other odd things on that horrible tableland -- things on her right that looked vaguely like factory chimneys, and, on her left, a huge cliff, straighter than any cliff ought to be. But she wasn't at all interested and didn't give them a thought. The only things she thought about were her cold hands (and nose and chin and ears) and hot baths and beds at Harfang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔拉起风帽，低着头，麻木的双手藏在斗篷里，一路挣扎着向前，她在这可怕的高地上还看见了其他一些古怪的东西。她右边那些东西看上去隐约像是工厂的烟囱，她左边有一大块悬崖比任何悬崖都陡直。但她丝毫不感兴趣，没把这些放在心上。她只想一件事，就是她那双冰凉的手（还有冰凉的鼻子、下巴和耳朵），还想到哈方的热水澡和床。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Half a sec. I'll go and see," said Jill. She got up and walked along the trench; but before she had gone far, it turned sharply to the right. She shouted this information back to the others.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我想这儿到哪儿也不通。”吉尔说着，赶紧往回走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Be careful, Pole. It's just the sort of place that might lead to a dragon's cave. And in a giant country, there might be giant earth-worms or giant beetles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小心点，波尔。这正是那种可能通往龙洞的地方。在巨人国里，还可能有巨大的蚯蚓和巨大的甲虫呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It proved, however, a disappointing exploration. They went round the right-hand turn and straight on for a few paces. Here there was a choice of ways: straight on again, or sharp to the right. "That's no good," said Scrubb, glancing down the right-hand turn, "that would be taking us back -- south." He went straight on, but once more, in a few steps, they found a second turn to the right. But this time there was no choice of ways, for the trench they had been following here came to a dead end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这次探险结果真令人失望。他们往右拐弯后朝前只走了几步，就碰到有两条路可走，要么再往前一直走，要么朝右急转弯。“不行，”斯克罗布看了右转弯那条路一眼说，“那样又走回去——到南面了。”他就一直往前走，但只走了几步，他们又一次发现了第二条往右拐的路，但这回没有其他路好走了，因为他们走的这条沟到这儿就到头了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm jolly well going to have a look," said Scrubb. "What do you mean by anywhere much, I should like to know?" So he sat down on the edge of the trench (everyone was too wet by now to bother about being a bit wetter) and then dropped in. He pushed past Jill and, though he didn't say anything, she felt sure that he knew she had funked it. So she followed him close, but took care not to get in front of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我最好去看一看，”斯克罗布说，“我倒想知道哪儿也不通是什么意思？”于是他坐在沟边上（如今大家都浑身透湿，再湿一点也无所谓了），接着就落在沟里。他从吉尔身边挤过去，尽管他嘴上没说什么，她心里确信他知道她是因为害怕才不去的。因此她就紧紧跟着他，只是小心翼翼别走在他头里。'">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No good," grunted Scrubb. Jill lost no time in turning and leading the way back. When they returned to the place where Jill had first fallen in, the Marsh-wiggle with his long arms had no difficulty in pulling them out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不行。”斯克罗布咕哝说。吉尔立刻转身带路回去。等他们回到吉尔掉下来的地方，沼泽怪的长胳膊毫不费力就把他们拉了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, come on! Bother the signs," said Pole. "Something about someone mentioning Aslan's name, I think. But I'm jolly well not going to give a recitation here."</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was dreadful to be out on top again. Down in those narrow slits of trenches, their ears had almost begun to thaw. They had been able to see clearly and breathe easily and hear each other speak without shouting. It was absolute misery to come back into the withering coldness. And it did seem hard when Puddleglum chose that moment for saying:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但回到上面实在太可怕了。在下面那些狭长的沟里，他们的耳朵几乎都开始回暖了。他们眼睛也看得清，呼吸也轻松，对方说话不用嚷嚷也听得清。回到这刺骨的寒冷中简直是活受罪。令人难堪的是，普德格伦竟挑了这么个时候说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As you see, she had got the order wrong. That was because she had given up saying the signs over every night. She still really knew them, if she troubled to think: but she was no longer so "pat" in her lesson as to be sure of reeling them off in the right order at a moment's notice and without thinking. Puddleglum's question annoyed her because, deep down inside her, she was already annoyed with herself for not knowing the Lion's lesson quite so well as she felt she ought to have known it. This annoyance, added to the misery of being very cold and tired, made her say, "Bother the signs." She didn't perhaps quite mean it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你们大概看得出，她已经把指示的次序搞错了。那是因为她已经放弃了每天晚上把指示背一遍的习惯。要是她肯费心想一想，她其实还是知道的，但她对自己的功课已不再背得滚瓜烂熟，遇到人家一问，未能不假思索一字不差地背出来。普德格伦这一问惹恼了她，因为在她内心深处，她已经对自己不那么熟悉狮王的功课很恼火了，她觉得自己本来应该熟悉的。心里恼火，加上又冷又累，痛苦不堪，她竟说出了“去他的指示”。也许她并不是有意的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, look, look, look," cried Jill and pointed. Everyone turned, and everyone saw. Some way off to the north, and a good deal higher up than the tableland on which they stood, a line of lights had appeared. This time, even more obviously than when the travellers had seen them the night before, they were windows: smaller windows that made one think deliciously of bedrooms, and larger windows that made one think of great halls with fires roaring on the hearth and hot soup or juicy sirloins smoking on the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，瞧，瞧，瞧！”吉尔叫着，用于一指。大家都回过身来，都看见了。朝北再过去一点，比他们站着的这块高地还要高得多的地方，已经出现了一排灯。这一回，比这三个旅客昨晚看见的甚至更明显了。那些都是窗户：小点儿的窗户使人美美地想起卧室，大点儿的窗户使人想起壁炉里火光熊熊的柴堆，餐桌上热汤和油汪汪的牛腰肉正冒着热气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, shut up," said Jill crossly. "We haven't a moment to lose. Don't you remember what the Lady said about their locking up so early? We must get there in time, we must, we must. We'll die if we're shut out on a night like this."</div>

<div class="line_en">In spite of their haste, it took them a long time to cross the flat top of that hill. And even when they had crossed it, there were still several ledges to climb down on the far side. But at last they reached the bottom and could see what Harfang was like.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他们急忙赶路，要穿过那小山的平顶却花了他们很长时间。即使他们已经穿过了山顶，远处也还有几块突出的石头要爬下去。最后他们终于到了山下，这才看得见哈方是什么样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, it isn't exactly a night, not yet," began Puddleglum; but the two children both said, "Come on," and began stumbling forward on the slippery tableland as quickly as their legs would carry them. The Marsh-wiggle followed them: still talking, but now that they were forcing their way into the wind again, they could not have heard him even if they had wanted to. And they didn't want. They were thinking of baths and beds and hot drinks; and the idea of coming to Harfang too late and being shut out was almost unbearable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“得了，这还不是晚上，还没到呢。”普德格伦开口说，但两个孩子都说“来吧”，就开始在清溜溜的高地上跌跌冲冲，尽快向前奔去。沼泽怪跟着他们，嘴里还在说话，不过这会儿他们已经再次冲进风里，即使他们想听它说话也听不见了。而且他们也不想听。他们想的是洗澡和床铺以及热饮料；想起赶到哈方太晚，被关在门外就叫人受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It stood on a high crag, and in spite of its many towers was more a huge house than a castle. Obviously, the Gentle Giants feared no attack. There were windows in the outside wall quite close to the ground -- a thing no one would have in a serious fortress. There were even odd little doors here and there, so that it would be quite easy to get in and out of the castle without going through the courtyard. This raised the spirits of Jill and Scrubb. It made the whole place look more friendly and less forbidding.</div>

<div class="line_en">A door opened, letting out a delicious glow of firelight, and the Porter appeared. Jill bit her lips for fear she should scream. He was not a perfectly enormous giant; that is to say, he was rather taller than an apple tree but nothing like so tall as a telegraph pole. He had bristly red hair, a leather jerkin with metal plates fastened all over it so as to make a kind of mail shirt, bare knees (very hairy indeed) and things like puttees on his legs. He stooped down and goggled at Puddleglum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一扇门开了，漏出一抹诱人的炉火火光，看门的出来了。吉尔吓得咬住嘴唇生怕自己尖叫起来。他并不完全是个大个子巨人；就是说他比一棵苹果树高些，但还没有一根电线杆那么高。他长着一头又短又硬的头发，一件无袖短皮上衣，上面钉着好多金属片，像是要把上衣变成一件铠甲；双膝光着（当然上面有好多汗毛），腿上像是打着绑腿。他弯下腰，瞪大眼望着普德格伦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oho!" said the Porter. "That's quite a different story. Come in, little people, come in. You'd best come into the lodge while I'm sending word to his Majesty." He looked at the children with curiosity. "Blue faces," he said. "I didn't know they. were that colour. Don't care about it myself. But I dare say you look quite nice to one another. Beetles fancy other beetles, they do say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦嗬，”看门人说，“那就是另一回事了。进来吧，小不点儿，进来吧。我传话给陆下的时候，你们最好到门房里来。”他好奇地瞧瞧两个孩子。“青面孔，”他说，“我不知道他们竟是这种颜色。我本人对此倒不在乎。但我敢说，你们彼此间看看都挺好的。人家都说物以类聚嘛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill took her courage in both hands. "Please," she said, shouting up at the giant. "The Lady of the Green Kirtle salutes the King of the Gentle Giants, and has sent us two Southern children and this Marsh-wiggle (his name's Puddleglum) to your Autumn Feast. -- If it's quite convenient, of course," she added.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then come in and get warm. Come in, little shrimps," said the Porter. They followed him into the lodge. And though it was rather terrible to hear such a big door clang shut behind them, they forgot about it as soon as they saw the thing they had been longing for ever since supper time last night -- afire. And such a fire! It looked as if four or five whole trees were blazing on it, and it was so hot they couldn't go within yards of it. But they all flopped down on the brick floor, as near as they could bear the heat, and heaved great sighs of relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么进来取取暖吧。进来，小虾米。”看门人说。他们跟着他进了门房。尽管听见那么大一扇门在他们身后砰地关上，挺吓人的，但他们一看见从昨天晚饭时就一直想望的东西——一堆火，也就把这事忘了。多旺的一堆火啊！看上去似乎有四五棵树在熊熊燃烧，火堆那么热，他们在好几码以外就不能走近。不过他们全都扑通一下坐在砖地上，尽量靠近到受得了热气的地方，发出声声宽慰的叹息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, Froggy," said the Porter to Puddleglum, "you look as if you wanted some cheering up." He produced a black bottle very like Puddleglum's own, but about twenty times larger. "Let me see, let me see," said the Porter. "I can't give you a cup or you'll drown yourself. Let me see. This salt-cellar will be just the thing. You needn't mention it over at the House. The silver will keep on getting over here, and it's not my fault."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，青蛙儿，”看门人对普德格伦说，“看上去你需要点提神的。”他拿了一个黑瓶子，样子很像普德格伦自己那个，但比那个约大二十倍。“让我瞧瞧，让我瞧瞧。”看门人说，“我不能给你杯子，否则你会淹死。让我瞧瞧，那个盐瓶大概正合适。你到了王上那儿可不必提到这事。银器今后还会继续弄到这儿来的，而这可不是我的错。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, youngster," said the Porter to another giant who had been sitting in the back of the room, staring at the visitors till it looked as if his eyes would start out of his head, "run across with this message to the House." And he repeated what Jill had said to him. The younger giant, after a final stare, and a great guffaw, left the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，小子。”看门人对另一个巨人说，这人一直坐在房间后半部，眼睛瞪得像要掉下来似的，直盯着这些客人看。“跑去把这个信息报给王上。”他把吉尔对他说的话又重说了一遍。那个年轻点的巨人，临走还盯了他们一眼，喃喃大笑一阵，才离开了房间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The salt-cellar was not very like one of ours, being narrower and more upright, and made quite a good cup for Puddleglum, when the giant set it down on the floor beside him. The children expected Puddleglum to refuse it, distrusting the Gentle Giants as he did. But he muttered, "It's rather late to be thinking of precautions now that we're inside and the door shut behind us." Then he sniffed at the liquor. "Smells all right," he said. "But that's nothing to go by. Better make sure," and took a sip. "Tastes all right, too," he said. "But it might do that at the first sip. How does it go on?" He took a larger sip. "Ah!" he said. "But is it the same all the way down?" and took another. "There'll be something nasty at the bottom, I shouldn't wonder," he said, and finished the drink. He licked his lips and remarked to the children, "This'll be a test, you see. If I curl up, or burst, or turn into a lizard, or something, then you'll know not to take anything they offer you." But the giant, who was too far up to hear the things Puddleglum had been saying under his breath, roared with laughter and said, "Why, Froggy, you're a man. See him put it away!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个盐瓶不大像我们的盐瓶，它比较窄，比较直，巨人把盐瓶放在普德格伦身边地上，竟成了它一个挺合适的酒杯。两个孩子以为普德格伦原来就不信任斯文的巨人，会不肯喝，谁知它喃喃自语说“既然我们已经进来了，门也关上了，再想提防也来不及了。”接着它闻闻那酒。“味儿不错，”它说，“不过那也不足为凭，最好尝个明白。”于是它喝了一小口。“口味也不错，”它说，“不过初次上口可能不错。再喝下去又怎么样呢？”它喝了一大口。“啊！”它说，“但是不是全都一个味儿呢？”又喝了一大口。“要是底下有什么叫人恶心的东西，我是不会奇怪的。”它说着就把酒喝完了，舔舔嘴唇对两个孩子说“这是试验，你们懂吗？要是我倒下来，或是发作了，或是变成一条晰蹋什么的，那么你们就知道凡是他们给你们的东西都别碰。”不过那个巨人高高在上，听不见普德格伦一直在悄声说什么，却哈哈大笑说“喂，青蛙儿，你真是个男子汉。瞧瞧它把酒都喝光了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the young giant caught him up by the waist and signed to the children to follow. In this undignified way they crossed the courtyard. Puddleglum, held in the giant's fist, and vaguely kicking the air, did certainly look very like a frog. But they had little time to notice this, for they soon entered the great doorway of the main castle -- both their hearts beating faster than usual -- and, after pattering along several corridors at a trot to keep up with the giant's paces, found themselves blinking in the light of an enormous room, where lamps glowed and a fire roared on the hearth and both were reflected from the gilding of roof and cornice. More giants than they could count stood on their left and right, all in magnificent robes; and on two thrones at the far end, sat two huge shapes that appeared to be the King and Queen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那个年轻的巨人拦腰把它一把抓起，再做个手势叫两个孩子跟着走。他们就这样不成体统地穿过院子。抓在巨人手里的普德格伦神志不清地在空中蹬着腿，看上去倒确实像只青蛙了。不过他们也没工夫注意这事，因为他们一下子就走进了主城堡的大门口——他俩的心都比平时跳得更快了——为了赶上巨人的步伐，他们一路小跑，嘚嘚地跑过好几条走廊，不知不觉中就到了一间宏伟的屋子，给里面的亮光照得直眨眼睛，屋里灯火辉煌，炉火熊熊，灯火炉火都反射在镀金的屋顶和飞檐上。数不清的巨人都穿着华丽的袍子分站在左右两边。屋子尽头有两个宝座，坐着两个庞然大物，看来是国王和王后了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About twenty feet from the thrones, they stopped. Scrubb and Jill made an awkward attempt at a bow (girls are not taught how to curtsey at Experiment House) and the young giant carefully put Puddleglum down on the floor, where he collapsed into a sort of sitting position.
