<div class="line_en">The maester stood on the windswept balcony outside his chambers. It was here the ravens came, after long flight. Their droppings speckled the gargoyles that rose twelve feet tall on either side of him, a hellhound and a wyvern, two of the thousand that brooded over the walls of the ancient fortress. When first he came to Dragonstone, the army of stone grotesques had made him uneasy, but as the years passed he had grown used to them. Now he thought of them as old friends. The three of them watched the sky together with foreboding.</div>

<div class="line_en">The maester did not believe in omens. And yet… old as he was, Cressen had never seen a comet half so bright, nor yet that color, that terrible color, the color of blood and flame and sunsets. He wondered if his gargoyles had ever seen its like. They had been here so much longer than he had, and would still be here long after he was gone. If stone tongues could speak…</div>

<div class="line_en">Such folly. He leaned against the battlement, the sea crashing beneath him, the black stone rough beneath his fingers. Talking gargoyles and prophecies in the sky. I am an old done man, grown giddy as a child again. Had a lifetime's hard-won wisdom fled him along with his health and strength? He was a maester, trained and chained in the great Citadel of Oldtown. What had he come to, when superstition filled his head as if he were an ignorant fieldhand?</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet… and yet… the comet burned even by day now, while pale grey steam rose from the hot vents of Dragonmont behind the castle, and yestermorn a white raven had brought word from the Citadel itself, word long-expected but no less fearful for all that, word of summer's end. Omens, all. Too many to deny. What does it all mean? he wanted to cry.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maester Cressen, we have visitors." Pylos spoke softly, as if loath to disturb Cressen's solemn meditations. Had he known what drivel filled his head, he would have shouted. "The princess would see the white raven." Ever correct, Pylos called her princess now, as her lord father was a king. King of a smoking rock in the great salt sea, yet a king nonetheless. "Her fool is with her."</div>

<div class="line_en">Taking his arm, Pylos led him inside. In his youth, Cressen had walked briskly, but he was not far from his eightieth name day now, and his legs were frail and unsteady. Two years past, he had fallen and shattered a hip, and it had never mended properly. Last year when he took ill, the Citadel had sent Pylos out from Oldtown, mere days before Lord Stannis had closed the isle… to help him in his labors, it was said, but Cressen knew the truth. Pylos had come to replace him when he died. He did not mind. Someone must take his place, and sooner than he would like…</div>

<div class="line_en">When Pylos returned the girl came with him, shy as ever. Behind her, shuffling and hopping in that queer sideways walk of his, came her fool. On his head was a mock helm fashioned from an old tin bucket, with a rack of deer antlers strapped to the crown and hung with cowbells. With his every lurching step, the bells rang, each with a different voice, clang-a-dang bong-dong ring-a-ling clong clong clong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小女孩跟着派洛斯一起进来，羞怯一如往常。在她身后拖步轻跳、古怪横行的，则是她的弄臣。他戴着一顶老旧锡桶做的玩具头盔，顶端捆了两根鹿角，上面挂着牛铃，随着他的蹒跚脚步而发出不同声响：铿啷当、碰咚、铃铃、嗑啷啷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who comes to see us so early, Pylos?" Cressen said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“派洛斯，是谁一大早来拜访我们？”克礼森问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's me and Patches, Maester." Guileless blue eyes blinked at him. Hers was not a pretty face, alas. The child had her lord father's square jut of jaw and her mother's unfortunate ears, along with a disfigurement all her own, the legacy of the bout of greyscale that had almost claimed her in the crib. Across half one cheek and well down her neck, her flesh was stiff and dead, the skin cracked and flaking, mottled black and grey and stony to the touch. "Pylos said we might see the white raven."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“师傅，是我和阿丁。”她天真无瑕的蓝眼睛朝他直眨，只可惜她的脸蛋并不漂亮。这孩子不仅有她父亲突出的方下巴，而且很不幸地继承了她母亲那双耳朵。除此之外，她年幼时曾感染灰鳞病，险些丧命，后虽逃过一劫，却留下可怕的残缺：半边脸颊直到颈部下方，皮肤全部僵硬坏死，表面干裂，层层剥落，夹杂着黑灰斑点，抚触起来宛如硬石。“派洛斯说可以让我们看看白鸦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed you may," Cressen answered. As if he would ever deny her. She had been denied too often in her time. Her name was Shireen. She would be ten on her next name day, and she was the saddest child that Maester Cressen had ever known. Her sadness is my shame, the old man thought, another mark of my failure. "Maester Pylos, do me a kindness and bring the bird down from the rookery for the Lady Shireen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然可以。”克礼森回答。他怎么忍心拒绝她？难道她失去的还不够多吗？她名叫希琳，就快满十岁了，而她是克礼森学士所见过最哀伤的孩子。她的哀伤是我的耻辱，老学士心想，另一个我失职的永恒烙印。“派洛斯师傅，有劳你把鸟儿从鸦巢里带过来给希琳公主看看。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It would be my pleasure." Pylos was a polite youth, no more than five-and-twenty, yet solemn as a man of sixty. If only he had more humor, more life in him; that was what was needed here. Grim places needed lightening, not solemnity, and Dragonstone was grim beyond a doubt, a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt, with the smoking shadow of the mountain at its back. A maester must go where he is sent, so Cressen had come here with his lord some twelve years past, and he had served, and served well. Yet he had never loved Dragonstone, nor ever felt truly at home here. Of late, when he woke from restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly, he often did not know where he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我的荣幸。”派洛斯是个谦恭有礼的年轻人，年方廿五，却严肃得像个六旬老翁。假如他多些幽默感，多些活力就好了，此地就缺这个。阴沉之地需要愉悦，而非肃穆。龙石岛是一座海中孤寂的堡垒，地势乃是湿冷荒原，终年为暴风恶水环绕，背后又有火山烟影，阴沉自然不在话下。但职责所趋，学士便必须毅然前往，所以十二年前克礼森随公爵来到龙石岛，为之效命，尽忠职守。然而他从未真心爱过龙石岛，也始终没有找到归属感。近来，红袍女每每妖魅般浮现梦中，使他骤然惊醒，却惶惶不知身在何处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch Pylos climb the steep iron steps to the rookery. His bells rang with the motion. "Under the sea, the birds have scales for feathers," he said, clang-a-langing. "I know, I know, oh, oh, oh."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弄臣转过他那肤色不一、斑纹满布的头，看着派洛斯爬上高耸的铁梯行往鸦巢，头盔上的铃铛随之作响。“海底下，鸟儿生鳞不长羽，”他说，喀啷啷啷，“我知道，我知道，噢噢噢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even for a fool, Patchface was a sorry thing. Perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter with a quip, but the sea had taken that power from him, along with half his wits and all his memory. He was soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles, incoherent as often as not. The girl was the only one who laughed at him now, the only one who cared if he lived or died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便以弄臣的标准而言，补丁脸依旧是个失败的角色。很久很久以前，或许他能轻易引来哄堂大笑，但大海夺走了他的能力，同时也夺走了他大半神智和所有记忆。他体态肥软，时而莫名地抽搐颤抖，又时而连话都说不清。这小女孩是现在唯一还会被他逗笑的人，大概也只有她在乎他的死活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. "We have talked of this before," he said gently. "The dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of stone, child. In olden days, our island was the westernmost outpost of the great Freehold of Valyria. It was the Valyrians who raised this citadel, and they had ways of shaping stone since lost to us. A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense. The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations." He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze. "So you see, there is nothing to fear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克礼森学士记得小女孩长年恶梦缠身。“我不是跟你说过吗？”他温柔地说，“巨龙已死，再也无法复生。孩子，它们都是石雕。在很久很久以前，我们这座岛是强大的瓦雷利亚自由城邦最西边的前哨站。建造这座城堡的是瓦雷利亚人，虽然他们的伟大技艺业已失传。为抵御外侮，他们在要塞的每个城墙交会处都筑起塔楼。瓦雷利亚人刻意将这些塔楼雕凿成恶龙形状，好让城堡看来更加骇人。他们之所以舍弃普通的城垛，而改用千百尊狰狞石像，也是为了这个目的。”他伸出自己斑驳干瘦的手，轻轻握了一下她粉嫩的小手。“所以啰，没什么好怕的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="希琳却不为所动。“那天上飞的又是什么东西？上次黛拉和梅翠丝在井边说话，黛拉说她听到那个红衣服的女人跟妈妈说那是‘龙息’。假如龙会呼吸，那不就是它们活过来了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Cressen's fingers went to the chain about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of learning; the maester's collar, mark of his order. In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin. "They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most important messages. This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great summer done at last. Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living memory."</div>

<div class="line_en">Patchface had come to them as a boy. Lord Steffon of cherished memory had found him in Volantis, across the narrow sea. The king -- the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in those days -- had sent his lordship to seek a bride for Prince Rhaegar, who had no sisters to wed. "We have found the most splendid fool," he wrote Cressen, a fortnight before he was to return home from his fruitless mission. "Only a boy, yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers. He juggles and riddles and does magic, and he can sing prettily in four tongues. We have bought his freedom and hope to bring him home with us. Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach Stannis how to laugh."</div>

<div class="line_en">It saddened Cressen to remember that letter. No one had ever taught Stannis how to laugh, least of all the boy Patchface. The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker Bay proved the truth of its name. The lord's two-masted galley Windproud broke up within sight of his castle. From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their father's ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters. A hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below Storm's End.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy washed up on the third day. Maester Cressen had come down with the rest, to help put names to the dead. When they found the fool he was naked, his skin white and wrinkled and powdered with wet sand. Cressen had thought him another corpse, but when Jommy grabbed his ankles to drag him off to the burial wagon, the boy coughed water and sat up. To his dying day, Jommy had sworn that Patchface's flesh was clammy cold.</div>

Yet his fool's face left no doubt of who he was. It was the fashion in the Free City of Volantis to tattoo the faces of slaves and servants; from neck to scalp the boy's skin had been patterned in squares of red and green motley.</div>

<div class="line_en">Castles are not friendly places for the frail, Cressen was reminded as he descended the turnpike stairs of Sea Dragon Tower. Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the Painted Table, atop the Stone Drum, Dragonstone's central keep, so named for the way its ancient walls boomed and rumbled during storms. To reach him they must cross the gallery, pass through the middle and inner walls with their guardian gargoyles and black iron gates, and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate. Young men climbed steps two at a time; for old men with bad hips, every one was a torment. But Lord Stannis would not think to come to him, so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal.

In the yard, archers were firing at practice butts to the call of "Notch, draw, loose." Their arrows made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing. Guardsmen strode the wallwalks, peering between the gargoyles on the host camped without. The morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires, as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts beneath the banners of their lords. Past the sprawl of the camp, the anchorage was crowded with ships. No craft that had come within sight of Dragonstone this past half year had been allowed to leave again. Lord Stannis's Fury, a triple-decked war galley of three hundred oars, looked almost small beside some of the big-bellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her.</div>

Lord Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year, against the great host of the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne. Even the sea was closed against them, watched day and night by Redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor. Within Storm's End, the horses had long since been eaten, the dogs and cats were gone, and the garrison was down to roots and rats. Then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars. Cloaked in that darkness, Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike. His little ship had a black hull, black sails, black oars, and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish. Little enough, yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm's End and break the siege.</div>

Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself; he would accept no punishment from lesser hands. The lord had used a butcher's cleaver, the better to cut clean and true. Afterward, Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house, and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey field -- with an onion on its sails.

Aegon's carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros, sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight. On its surface, darkened by near three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they had been in Aegon's day; rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩公爵的厅堂是一个宽阔的圆形房间，墙壁由黑石砌成，上无装饰。厅内有四扇高大窄窗，面向东西南北四方。大厅中央有一张用巨木板雕刻而成的大桌——图桌厅正是因此而得名——这是伊耿·坦格利安在征服战争以前下令建造的。“地图桌”长过五十尺，最宽处约为长度的一半，最窄处不到四尺。伊耿的木匠依照维斯特落大陆的形状，锯出一个个海湾和半岛，整张桌子没有一处平直。桌面上描绘了伊耿那个时代的七大王国，所有的河川山脉、堡垒城市、湖泊森林…巨细无遗，泛着累积近三百年的亮漆光泽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a single chair in the room, carefully positioned in the precise place that Dragonstone occupied off the coast of Westeros, and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop. Seated in the chair was a man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool. When Maester Cressen entered, he glanced up. "I knew you would come, old man, whether I summoned you or no." There was no hint of warmth in his voice; there seldom was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个大厅仅有一张座椅，经过精心设计，正好对应维斯特洛外海龙石岛的所在，并位于隆起的高台之上，可将桌面一切尽收眼底。坐在椅子上的人穿着紧身皮背心和棕色粗羊毛长裤，克礼森一进门，他便抬起头。“老头子，我就知道，不管有没有叫你，你一定会来。”他话中不带丝毫感情，向来如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel. Hard was the word men used when they spoke of Stannis, and hard he was. Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head, circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown. His brother, the late King Robert, had grown a beard in his final years. Maester Cressen had never seen it, but they said it was a wild thing, thick and fierce. As if in answer, Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short. They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks. His eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night. His mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools; it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh. Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester Cressen fancied he could hear Lord Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="龙石岛公爵史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩蒙诸神恩宠，乃是铁王座的合法继承人，维斯特洛七大王国的统治者。他生得肩膀宽阔，四肢健壮，面容紧绷，皮肤经烈日长期曝晒，坚硬如铁。“坚毅”是人们最常用来形容史坦尼斯的词，而他也的确不负其名。虽然他还不到三十五岁，头上却只剩一排黑色细发，宛如王冠的影子，环绕在双耳之后。他的哥哥，故王劳勃，在生命的最后几年留起了胡子。克礼森学士虽没有亲眼目睹，却听人说那是一大把粗厚的黑胡子。史坦尼斯也同时把胡子修得又短又齐，像是蓝黑的影子，覆盖住他的方下巴和两颊的颧骨凹陷，彷彿欲藉此表示回应。一双浓眉之下，他的眼睛就像两个伤口，深蓝有如黑夜汪洋。再怎么滑稽可笑的弄臣，遇上他那张嘴也要徒劳无功，那是一张生来与皱眉、怒容和严词峻令为伍的嘴，它苍白、薄细而紧绷，早已忘却如何微笑，更不知开怀为何物。夜深人静之时，克礼森学士偶尔还会幻想自己听见相隔半个城堡之遥的史坦尼斯公爵磨牙霍霍之声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"His," Stannis broke in, "when by rights they should be mine. I never asked for Dragonstone. I never wanted it. I took it because Robert's enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out. I built his fleet and did his work, dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me. And what was Robert's thanks? He names me Lord of Dragonstone, and gives Storm's End and its incomes to Renly. Storm's End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的？”史坦尼斯打断他，“照理说，他们应该是我的封臣。我从没开口要过龙石岛，我根本不想要这鬼地方。我拿下此地，是因为劳勃的敌人盘踞在这，而他命令我将之扫平。我为他建立舰队，打败敌人，完全尽了作弟弟的本分——蓝礼也应该这样对我才对——后来呢，你看劳勃怎么感谢我？他任命我为龙石岛公爵，却把风息堡的领地和税赋都给了蓝礼。三百年来，风息堡一直是拜拉席恩家族的世袭领地，照理说，劳勃登上铁王座，就该换我统治才对。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was an old grievance, deeply felt, and never more so than now. Here was the heart of his lord's weakness; for Dragonstone, old and strong though it was, commanded the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords, whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed. Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这段陈年往事伤他很深，如今益发明显。眼下，这是他事业的致命伤：龙石岛虽然历史悠久，固若金汤，但旗下仅有少数小贵族，他们管辖的外岛领地多石崎岖，人烟稀少，根本不足以提供史坦尼斯所需的军力。即便加上他从狭海对岸自由贸易城邦密尔和里斯等地雇来的佣兵，驻扎城外的部队总数依旧完全不足以和兰尼斯特家族对抗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“劳勃固然待你不公，”克礼森学士谨慎地回答，“然而在当初，他也有他的考量。龙石岛自古以来就是坦格利安家族的根据地，他需要强有力的人来统治这里，而蓝礼那时只是个孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table, his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King's Landing now stood. There he stood, brooding over the realm he sought to claim, so near at hand and yet so far away. "Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they are. Celtigar, Velaryon, Bar Emmon, the whole paltry lot of them. A poor crop, if truth be told, but they are what my brothers have left me. That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with the latest tally of what I owe him, and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales, while Lord Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven.

I held Storm's End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert's command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand?

<div class="line_en">His chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning. With fumbling hands, the old man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery stair, where his ointments, potions, and medicines stood neatly on their shelves. On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass, no larger than his little finger. It rattled when he shook it. Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table. Collapsing into his chair, he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial's contents.

It was made from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the Jade Sea, half a world away. The leaves had to be aged, and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the Summer Isles. Afterward they could be discarded, but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize. The process was slow and difficult, the necessaries costly and hard to acquire. The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it, though, and the Faceless Men of Braavos… and the maesters of his order as well, though it was not something talked about beyond the walls of the Citadel.

<div class="line_en">The maester found the crystals where he had left them, and scooped them off the parchment. Cressen owned no hollow rings, such as the poisoners of Lys were said to favor, but a myriad of pockets great and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of his robe. He secreted the strangler seeds in one of them, threw open his door, and called, "Pylos? Where are you?" When he heard no reply, he called again, louder. "Pylos, I need help."

<div class="line_en">Cressen looked over the knights and captains and lords sitting silent. Lord Celtigar, aged and sour, wore a mantle patterned with red crabs picked out in garnets. Handsome Lord Velaryon chose sea-green silk, the white gold seahorse at his throat matching his long fair hair. Lord Bar Emmon, that plump boy of fourteen, was swathed in purple velvet trimmed with white seal, Ser Axell Florent remained homely even in russet and fox fur, pious Lord Sunglass wore moonstones at throat and wrist and finger, and the Lysene captain Salladhor Saan was a sunburst of scarlet satin, gold, and jewels. Only Ser Davos dressed simply, in brown doublet and green wool mantle, and only Ser Davos met his gaze, with pity in his eyes.</div>
