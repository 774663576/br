<div class="line_en">Harrenhal's bathhouse was a dim, steamy, low-ceilinged room filled with great stone tubs. When they led Jaime in, they found Brienne seated in one of them, scrubbing her arm almost angrily. "Not so hard, wench," he called. "You'll scrub the skin off." She dropped her brush and covered her teats with hands as big as Gregor Clegane's. The pointy little buds she was so intent on hiding would have looked more natural on some ten-year-old than they did on her thick muscular chest.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lord Bolton insists I sup with him, but he neglected to invite my fleas." Jaime tugged at his guard with his left hand. "Help me out of these stinking rags." One-handed, he could not so much as unlace his breeches. The man obeyed grudgingly, but he obeyed. "Now leave us," Jaime said when his clothes lay in a pile on the wet stone floor. "My lady of Tarth doesn't want the likes of you scum gaping at her teats." He pointed his stump at the hatchet-faced woman attending Brienne. "You too. Wait without. There's only the one door, and the wench is too big to try and shinny up a chimney."</div>

<div class="line_en">The habit of obedience went deep. The woman followed his guard out, leaving the bathhouse to the two of them. The tubs were large enough to hold six or seven, after the fashion of the Free Cities, so Jaime climbed in with the wench, awkward and slow. Both his eyes were open, though the right remained somewhat swollen, despite Qybum's leeches. Jaime felt a hundred and nine years old, which was a deal better than he had been feeling when he came to Harrenhal.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This one suits me well enough." Gingerly, he immersed himself up to the chin in the steaming water. "Have no fear, wench. Your thighs are purple and green, and I'm not interested in what you've got between them." He had to rest his right arm on the rim, since Qyburn had warned him to keep the linen dry. He could feel the tension drain from his legs, but his head spun. "if I faint, pull me out. No Lannister has ever drowned in his bath and I don't mean to be the first."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我就看中这缸。”他小心翼翼地舒展身子，直到冒蒸汽的热水漫到下巴。“别怕，妞儿，你嫩得跟青草似的，我对你那儿的东西没兴趣。”他将右臂放到缸子外，因为科本警告他必须保持亚麻布绷带的干燥，股间的压力逐渐舒缓，头脑却眩晕起来。“若见我昏厥，赶快把我拖出去，没有哪个兰尼斯特是洗澡时淹死的，我可不想当头名。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still, the water darkened as the caked dirt dissolved off his skin. The wench kept her back to him, the muscles in her great shoulders hunched and hard.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Does the sight of my stump distress you so?" Jaime asked. "You ought to be pleased. I've lost the hand I killed the king with. The hand that flung the Stark boy from that tower. The hand I'd slide between my sister's thighs to make her wet." He thrust his stump at her face. "No wonder Renly died, with you guarding him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你就这么厌恶见到残废？”詹姆问，“其实你该高兴才对，我所失去的这只手，正是杀害国王的罪魁元凶，也是它将那史塔克小孩从塔顶扔下，是它伸到我老姐双股之间，将她弄湿。”他用断肢去碰她的脸。“瞧你，这副德行，难怪保不住蓝礼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She jerked to her feet as if he'd struck her, sending a wash of hot water across the tub. Jaime caught a glimpse of the thick blonde bush at the juncture of her thighs as she climbed out. She was much hairier than his sister. Absurdly, he felt his cock stir beneath the bathwater. Now I know I have been too long away from Cersei. He averted his eyes, troubled by his body's response. "That was unworthy," he mumbled. "I'm a maimed man, and bitter. Forgive me, wench. You protected me as well as any man could have, and better than most."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不过碰了一下，她却像挨了打似地跳将起来，爬出浴缸，溅出许多热水。詹姆不经意间看到女人大腿间厚实的金毛丛。她的毛比老姐多。想到这，命根子竟荒谬地硬起来。这下该知道自己有多想念瑟曦了。他移开视线，不愿被对方发现身体的变化。“你别这样，”他喃喃道，“我都是个残废了，一身伤痛。唉，原谅我，妞儿，你从头到尾细心保护，武艺也比旁人都强。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You swore a solemn vow." He smiled as a red flush crept up the thick white column of her neck. She turned her back to him. "Still the shy maiden? What is it that you think I haven't seen?" He groped for the brush she had dropped, caught it with his fingers, and began to scrub himself desultorily. Even that was difficult, awkward. My left hand is good for nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然要管，你发下了神圣的誓言，”他嘻嘻笑道。一轮红晕爬上她厚实白皙的脖子，她转过头去，背身对他。“啧啧，您看，我忘了您还是个含羞的处女呢。”他摸索着去够她先前用的刷子，手指颤巍巍地捏住，散乱地擦起身体。好笨拙，好难看啊。左手真没用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He floated in heat, in memory. "After dancing griffins lost the Battle of the Bells, Aerys exiled him." Why am I telling this absurd ugly child? "He had finally realized that Robert was no mere outlaw lord to be crushed at whim, but the greatest threat House Targaryen had faced since Daemon Blackfyre. The king reminded Lewyn Martell gracelessly that he held Elia and sent him to take command of the ten thousand Domishmen coming up the kingsroad. Jon Darry and Barristan Selmy rode to Stoney Sept to rally what they could of griffins' men, and Prince Rhaegar returned from the south and persuaded his father to swallow his pride and summon my father. But no raven returned from Casterly Rock, and that made the king even more afraid. He saw traitors everywhere, and Varys was always there to point out any he might have missed. So His Grace commanded his alchemists to place caches of wildfire all over King's Landing. Beneath Baelor's Sept and the hovels of Flea Bottom, under stables and storehouses, at all seven gates, even in the cellars of the Red Keep itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在蒸汽和回忆中漂浮。“狮鹫在鸣钟之役中失败后，伊里斯流放了他。”我干吗把这些告诉这什么也不懂的丑小鸭？“这时国王已然明白，劳勃绝非什么可随意打发的土匪蟊贼，而是自戴蒙·黑火以来坦格利安家族所面临的最大威胁。于是他粗暴地提醒勒文·马泰尔亲王关注伊莉亚公主的安危，令他即刻沿国王大道南下，接管一万多恩军北上勤王；同时，调琼恩·戴瑞和巴利斯坦·赛尔弥前往石堂镇收容狮鹫麾下的败军。雷加王子也从南方归来，说服父王约束骄傲，召我父亲来援。但无论给凯岩城派出多少信鸦，都没回音。国王愈发恐惧，谁也不信任，瓦里斯火上浇油，列出长长的叛徒名单。最后，伊里斯下定决心，召来宠幸的炼金术士，命他们将野火罐子埋到全城各地。从贝勒大圣堂底到跳蚤窝的陋屋，马厩与仓库，七座城门，龙穴，甚至红堡的地窖内都有这些‘水果’。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Everything was done in the utmost secrecy by a handful of master pyromancers. They did not even trust their own acolytes to help. The queen's eyes had been closed for years, and Rhaegar was busy marshaling an army. But Aerys's new mace-anddagger Hand was not utterly stupid, and with Rossart, Belis, and Garigus coming and going night and day, he became suspicious. Chelsted, that was his name, Lord Chelsted." It had come back to him suddenly, with the telling. "I'd thought the man craven, but the day he confronted Aerys he found some courage somewhere. He did all he could to dissuade him. He reasoned, he jested, he threatened, and finally he begged. When that failed he took off his chain of office and flung it down on the floor. Aerys burnt him alive for that, and hung his chain about the neck of Rossart, his favorite pyromancer. The man who had cooked Lord Rickard Stark in his own armor. And all the time, I stood by the foot of the iron Throne in my white plate, still as a corpse, guarding my liege and all his sweet secrets."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My Sworn Brothers were all away, you see, but Aerys liked to keep me close. I was my father's son, so he did not trust me. He wanted me where Varys could watch me, day and night. So I heard it all." He remembered how Rossart's eyes would shine when he unrolled his maps to show where the substance must be placed. Garigus and Belis were the same. "Rhaegar met Robert on the Trident, and you know what happened there. When the word reached court, Aerys packed the queen off to Dragonstone with Prince Viserys. Princess Elia would have gone as well, but he forbade it. Somehow he had gotten it in his head that Prince Lewyn must have betrayed Rhaegar on the Trident, but he thought he could keep Dome loyal so long as he kept Elia and Aegon by his side. The traitors want my city, I heard him tell Rossart, but I'll give them naught but ashes. Let Robert be king over charred bones and cooked meat. The Targaryens never bury their dead, they burn them. Aerys meant to have the greatest funeral pyre of them all. Though if truth be told, I do not believe he truly expected to die. Like Aerion Brightfire before him, Aerys thought the fire would transform him… that he would rise again, reborn as a dragon, and turn all his enemies to ash."</div>

Pycelle convinced the king that his Warden of the West had come to defend him, so he opened the gates. The one time he should have heeded Varys, and he ignored him.

<div class="line_en">The next he knew, he was lying on the damp floor with the guards and the wench and Qybum all standing over him looking concerned. Brienne was naked, but she seemed to have forgotten that for the moment. "The heat of the tubs will do it," Maester Qyburn was telling them. No, he's not a maester, they took his chain. "There's still poison in his blood as well, and he's malnourished. What have you been feeding him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他醒来，发现自己躺在潮湿的地板上，守卫们、妞儿和科本关切地望着他。布蕾妮还是裸体，不过她似乎暂时忘记了。“热气的缘故，”科本学士诊断。不，他不是学士，他没有颈链。“他血液里还有污秽，且营养不良。你们给他吃什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Brienne went away to retrieve her towel, and returned with a stiff brush to finish scrubbing him. One of the guards gave her a razor to trim his beard. Qyburn returned with roughspun smallclothes, clean black woolen breeches, a loose green tunic, and a leather jerkin that laced up the front. Jaime was feeling less dizzy by then, though no less clumsy. With the wench's help he managed to dress himself. "Now all I need is a silver looking glass."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was obvious at once that the gown had been cut for someone with slimmer arms, shorter legs, and much fuller breasts. The fine Myrish lace did little to conceal the bruising that mottled Brienne's skin. All in all, the garb made the wench look ludicrous. She has thicker shoulders than I do, and a bigger neck, Jaime thought. Small wonder she prefers to dress in mail. Pink was not a kind color for her either.

A dozen spearmen in fur cloaks guarded the doors and the steps that led up to the two galleries above.

"Lord Vargo abandoned House Lannister because I offered him Harrenhal, a reward a thousand times greater than any he could hope to have from Lord Tywin. As a stranger to Westeros, he did not know the prize was poisoned."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，他有目的。山羊比看上去机灵得多。长期统率勇士团那样的队伍，需要的是脑子。”波顿用匕首叉起一大片肉，送到嘴里，仔细咀嚼，然后吞下。“我以赫伦堡作贿赂，瓦格大人方才背叛兰尼斯特家，因为他知道，这高出你父亲能开出的任何价码一千倍之多。但反过来，身为异乡人，他不明白这份奖品是有毒的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Lord Vargo doubtless hoped that Lord Starmis would triumph at King's Landing, and thence confirm him in his possession of this castle in gratitude for his small part in the downfall of House Lannister."

That one might have given him Harrenhal for his service… but he would have given him a noose for his crimes as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have no pity for our wretched doomed goat? Ah, but the gods must… else why deliver you into his hands?" Bolton chewed another chunk of meat. "Karhold is smaller and meaner than Harrenhal, but it lies well beyond the reach of the lion's claws. Once wed to Alys Karstark, Hoat might be a lord in truth. If he could collect some gold from your father so much the better, but he would have delivered you to Lord Rickard no matter how much Lord Tywin paid. His price would be the maid, and safe refuge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呵，你就不为我那可怜的、遭天谴的山羊感到一点遗憾么？噢，可诸神终究是…不然又为何把‘你’交到他手里？”波顿咀嚼起另一片肉。“卡霍城无论从面积或影响上论，都远不及赫伦堡，好在位于狮爪可触及的范围之外。只要娶亚丽·卡史塔克小姐为妻，山羊就能成为名副其实的领主老爷。他想从你父亲那边敲诈一笔，然后把你卖给瑞卡德大人。他要的是那位少女，是避难所。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Won every battle, while losing the Freys, the Karstarks, Winterfell, and the north. A pity the wolf is so young. Boys of sixteen always believe they are immortal and invincible. An older man would bend the knee, I'd think. After a war there is always a peace, and with peace there are pardons… for the Robb Starks, at least. Not for the likes of Vargo Hoat." Bolton gave him a small smile. "Both sides have made use of him, but neither will shed a tear at his passing. The Brave Companions did not fight in the Battle of the Blackwater, yet they died there all the same."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，战无不胜，却接连丢掉佛雷家族、卡史塔克家族、临冬城与整个北境。遗憾哪，少狼主只有十六岁，他这个年纪的孩子总以为自己强大而不朽。就我看来，老成的做法是找机会屈膝。战争的结局总归是和平，和平的前提是宽恕…至少，罗柏·史塔克能保住爵禄，瓦格·赫特这样的人就难了。”波顿给他一个极轻微的笑。“两边都在利用他，但两边都不会为他的下场流一滴眼泪。勇士团没有参加黑水河之战，但他们的死刑已在那里判决。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But to sell you he must keep you, and the riverlands are full of those who would gladly steal you away. Glover and Tallhart were broken at Duskendale, but remnants of their host are still abroad, with the Mountain slaughtering the stragglers. A thousand Karstarks prowl the lands south and east of Riverrun, hunting you. Elsewhere are Darry men left lordless and lawless, packs of four-footed wolves, and the lightning lord's outlaw bands. Dondarrion would gladly hang you and the goat together from the same tree." The Lord of the Dreadfort sopped up some of the blood with a chunk of bread. "Harrenhal was the only place Lord Vargo could hope to hold you safe, but here his Brave Companions are much outnumbered by my own men, and by Ser Aenys and his Freys. No doubt he feared I might return you to Ser Edmure at Riverrun… or worse, send you on to your father.</div>

"My lord, send me to Cersei, and I'll sing as sweet a song as you could want, of how gently you treated me." Any other answer, he knew, and Bolton would give him back to the goat.
