<div class="line_en">The wurse wakes Elsa up later that night because it needs a pee. She mumbles sleepily that maybe the wurse shouldn't have drunk so much mulled wine and tries to go back to sleep. But unfortunately the wurse begins to look sort of like wurses do when they're planning to pee on a Gryffindor scarf, whereupon Elsa snatches the scarf away and reluctantly agrees to take it out.</div>

The darkness outside the house is so compact that if you threw a snowball you'd lose sight of it before it left your glove. They sneak under Britt-Marie's balcony so they don't give the wurse away.

<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎还想问点儿别的，但这时他们听见了那个声音，或者说是呜嘶听见了那个声音。尖叫声。呜嘶跳出树丛，冲进夜色，犹如一杆黑色的长矛。爱莎第一次听见它的吠叫。她以为自己之前听过它吠叫，但她错了。这种吠叫让整栋房子的地基都颤抖。这是战斗的号叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wurse stands resolutely between them, its front paws planted like concrete pillars in the snow, its teeth bared. Sam isn't moving, but Elsa can see that he's hesitating. He slowly turns around and sees her, and his gaze pulverizes her spine. Her knees want to give way and let her sink into the snow and disappear. The knife glitters in the glow of the streetlights. Sam's hand hovers in the air, his body rigid with animosity. His eyes eat their way into her, cold and warlike. But the knife isn't directed at her, she can see that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呜嘶坚定地站在山姆和食品袋之间，它的前爪牢牢地扎进雪地里，犹如水泥立柱，它露出牙齿。山姆没有动，爱莎看出他在犹豫。他慢慢转过身，看见了她，那视线让她背脊发麻。她的膝盖差点儿跪在雪地上。刀在街灯的照射下泛着光。山姆的手举在空中，身体因恨意而僵直。他的目光像是要吞噬她，冰冷嗜战。但刀没有指向她，她看得出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa can hear Britt-Marie sobbing. She doesn't know where the instinct comes from, or the courage, or maybe it's just pure stupidity -- Granny always used to say that she and Elsa were the sort of people who, deep down, were a bit soft in the head, and it would get them in trouble sooner or later -- but Elsa runs. Runs right at Sam. She can see him bring the knife down confidently by a few inches, and that the other hand is raised like a claw to catch her as she leaps.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Alf is standing in front of Sam, with the same ominous body language. Elsa sees the hammer sliding into his palm from the coat-arm. Alf swings it calmly from side to side. Sam's knife doesn't move. They do not take their eyes off each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam's eyes wander calmly from Alf to the wurse. The wurse's hackles are raised. It growls like rolling thunder from its lungs. A faint smile steals across Sam's lips for an unbearable length of time. Then he takes a single step back and the darkness engulfs him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆镇静地从阿尔夫看向呜嘶。呜嘶脖子上的毛竖立着，低吼的声音就像是肺里轰鸣的惊雷。山姆的嘴角露出了一丝软弱的微笑，持续了一段让人难以承受的时间。然后他朝笼罩着自己的黑暗中后退了一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The police car skids into the street, but Sam is long gone by then. Elsa collapses into the snow as if her clothes have been emptied of whatever was in there. She feels Alf catching her and hears him hissing at the wurse to run up the stairs before the police catch sight of it. She hears Britt-Marie panting and the police crunching through the snow. But her consciousness is already fading, far away. She's ashamed of it, ashamed of being so afraid that she just closes her eyes and escapes into her mind. No knight of Miamas was ever so paralyzed with fear. A real knight would have stayed in position, straight-backed, not taken refuge in sleep. But she can't help it. It's too much reality for an almost-eight-year-old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警车呼啸着开进了这条街，但山姆早已经跑了。爱莎瘫倒在雪地里，好像她衣服中填充的东西突然消失了。她感觉阿尔夫接住了自己，听见他命令呜嘶在警察看到它前跑上楼。她听见布里特—玛丽的喘气和警察跑过雪地的声音，但意识已经模糊了。她很惭愧，为自己如此害怕而惭愧。她闭上眼睛，逃进了自己的意识中。没有一个密阿玛斯的骑士会被恐惧吓瘫，一位真正的骑士应该挺直脊背，严守岗位，而不是在沉睡中避难。但她控制不住自己。对一个即将八岁的孩子来说，这一切太过于真实了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa stops breathing. So much that she forgets to wonder about why Green-eyes is referring to Kent and Britt-Marie by their first names. Britt-Marie peers around the room, at Elsa and Mum and Maud and Lennart and the boy with a syndrome's mum. Last of all at Alf. His face is devoid of expression. The green eyes sweep over the front hall. There's sweat all over Elsa's palms when she opens and closes her hands to make them stop shaking. She knows that the wurse is sleeping just a few yards behind her, in Granny's bedroom. She knows that everything is lost, and she doesn't know what to do to stop it. She'll never be able to escape with the wurse through all the police she can hear at the bottom of the stairs, not even a wurse could pull that off. They'll shoot it. Kill it. She wonders if that was what the shadow had been planning all along. Because it didn't dare fight the wurse. Without the wurse, and without Wolfheart, the castle is defenseless.</div>
