<div class="line_en">Caspian felt sure that he would hate the new Tutor, buy when the new Tutor arrived about a week later he turns out to be the sort of person it is almost impossible not to like. He was the smallest, and also the fattest, man Caspian had ever seen. He had a long, silvery, pointed beard which came down to his waist, and his face, which was brown and covered with wrinkles, looked very wise, very ugly, and very kind. His voice was grave and his eyes were merry so that, until you got to know him really well, it was hard to know when he was joking and when he was serious. His name was Doctor Cornelius.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾深信未来的家庭教师一定非常讨厌。出乎意料的是，一个礼拜后，当那家庭教师出现在他面前时，凯斯宾发现他竟然非常讨人喜欢。他是凯斯宾见过的最矮也最肥胖的人，长长的胡子一直垂到肚子上。他那张棕色的脸上布满了皱纹，虽然长得很丑，但和善的眼睛里充满了智慧。他的声音十分庄重，他的眼睛却时常闪烁着诙谐的笑意，所以在对他十分熟悉之前，你很难判断出他什么时候是在开玩笑，什么时候却是顶认真的。他叫克奈尔斯博士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of all his lessons with Doctor Cornelius the one that Caspian liked best was History. Up till now, except for Nurse's stories, he had known nothing about the History of Narnia, and he was very surprised to learn that the royal family were newcomers in the country.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在克奈尔斯博士讲授的所有课程中，凯斯宾最喜欢的莫过于历史课了。迄今为止，除了保姆的那些故事以外，他对纳尼亚的历史一无所知。当教授讲到皇族是如何迁移到纳尼亚并成为统治者的时候，他感到惊讶万分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was your Highness's ancestor, Caspian the First," said Doctor Cornelius, "who first conquered Narnia and made it his kingdom. It was he who brought all your nation into the country. You are not native Narnians at all. You are all Telmarines -- that is, you all came from the Land of Telmar, far beyond the Western Mountains. That is why Caspian the First is called Caspian the Conqueror."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是殿下的祖先，凯斯宾一世，”克奈尔斯博士缓缓地说，“他第一个征服了纳尼亚，并成为那里的国王。把你们整个民族带到纳尼亚来的就是他。你们并不是真正的纳尼亚人，你们都是台尔马人，来自西部大山那边十分遥远的台尔马国。正是为了这个缘故，凯斯宾一世被称为征服者凯斯宾。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This didn't seem to have anything to do with Old Narnia, which was what Caspian really wanted to hear about, but getting up in the middle of the night is always interesting and he was moderately pleased. When he went to bed that night, he thought at first that he would not be able to sleep; but he soon dropped off and it seemed only a few minutes before he felt someone gently shaking him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这和古代纳尼亚似乎并没有什么关系，凯斯宾真正想要知道的并不是这个。可不管怎么说，半夜起床总是件新鲜事，他感到十分高兴。他原以为会兴奋得睡不着觉，可实际上很快就进入了梦乡。不过，好像才睡了不过几分钟，便感到有人轻轻地在推他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this he was not disappointed. A few days later his Tutor said, "Tonight I am going to give you a lesson in Astronomy.

<div class="line_en">Caspian remembered at once what they were going to do. He got up and put on some clothes. Athough it was a summer night he felt colder than he had expected and was quite glad when the Doctor wrapped him in a robe like his own and gave him a pair of warm, soft buskins for his feet. A moment later, both muffled so that they could hardly be seen in the dark corridors, and both shod so that they made almost no noise, master and pupil left the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾马上清醒过来，他一骨碌爬起身，开始穿衣服。尽管这是夏天，他仍感到出乎意料的凉意。博士给他披上一件同样的斗篷，又帮他穿上一双温暖轻便的高筒靴。有了斗篷和靴子，在黑暗的过道里就不容易被人看见，而且走起来一点儿声音都没有。就这样，他们俩离开了房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caspian followed the Doctor through many passages and up several staircases, and at last, through a little door in a turret, they came out upon the leads. On one side were the battlements, on the other a steep roof; below them, all shadowy and shimmery, the castle gardens; above them, stars and moon. Presently they came to another door, which led into the great central tower of the whole castle: Doctor Cornelius unlocked it and they began to climb the dark winding stair of the tower. Caspian was becoming excited; he had never been allowed up this stair before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也不知穿过了多少走廊，爬了多少楼梯，最后经过塔楼的一扇小门，他们终于来到外面的平台上。从这里朝下看，是幽暗的城堡花园，抬头望去，是一轮明月和满天的星斗。他们快步走向另一扇门，这门通向城堡中心巨大的高塔。克奈尔斯博士打开锁，领着凯斯宾沿塔内的旋转楼梯向上爬去。凯斯宾开始兴奋起来，以前是从来不许他爬这楼梯的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不会的，亲爱的王子，”博士轻声地说，”苍天那些伟大的星宿太熟悉它们的舞步了，怎么会相撞呢。你好好地看着吧，它们的聚会是吉祥的，会给苦难的纳尼亚带来巨大的幸福。看啊，胜利之神塔瓦在向和平女神阿拉姆毕尔致敬了，看——它们就要到相距最近的位置了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was long and steep, but when they came out on the roof of the tower and Caspian had got his breath, he felt that it had been well worth it. Away on his right he could see, rather indistinctly, the Western Mountains. On his left was the gleam of the Great River, and everything was so quiet that he could hear the sound of the waterfall at Beaversdam, a mile away. There was no difficulty in picking out the two stars they had come to see. They hung rather low in the southern sky, almost as bright as two little moons and very close together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼梯很长，也很陡。爬到塔顶时，凯斯宾已是气喘吁吁。但他马上发现再累些也值得。向右边极目望去，山峦重重，依稀可见：左边则有一条大河，蜿蜒而去。此时万籁俱寂，凯斯宾甚至听得见一英里外海狸大坝的水声。分辨那两颗他们想看的星星似乎并非难事它们低垂在南方，明亮得就像小小的月亮，而且相距非常近。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Doctor Cornelius said nothing for about two minutes, but stood still with his eyes fixed on Tarva and Alambil. Then he drew a deep breath and turned to Caspian.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我之所以选择这个地方，”克奈尔斯博士说，“是因为我们下面有六间空房子，还有一个长长的楼梯，而且楼梯底下的小门已经上了锁，没有人能偷听我们讲话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Listen," said the Doctor. "All you have heard about Old Narnia is true. It is not the land of Men. It is the country of Aslan, the country of the Waking Trees and Visible Naiads, of Fauns and Satyrs, of Dwarfs and Giants, of the gods and the Centaurs, of Talking Beasts. It was against these that the first Caspian fought. It is you Telmarines who silenced the beasts and the trees and the fountains, and who killed and drove away the Dwarfs and Fauns, and are now trying to cover up even the memory of them. The King does not allow them to be spoken of."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”博士说，“你所听到有关纳尼亚的每一个传说都是真实的，纳尼亚原本不是人类的领土，它属于伟大的阿斯兰。在这个国家里，有神志清醒的大树，有机灵活泼的水中仙女，有羊怪，有森林之神、小矮人和巨人，有海狸和人头马，还有许多其他会讲话的动物。与凯斯宾一世战斗的就是它们。正是你们台尔马人，使得所有这些生灵、树木和流水都变得沉默不语，是你们屠杀并赶走了小矮人和羊怪，现在甚至想把这一切永远地从人们的记忆中抹掉。想想看，国王为什么不允许人们提起这些往事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am," said the Doctor. "But remember. You and I must never talk about these things except here -- on the very top of the Great Tower."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不管怎样，咱们是同类呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you've guessed it in the end," said Doctor Cornelius. "Or guessed it nearly right. I'm not a pure Dwarf. I have human blood in me too. Many Dwarfs escaped in the great battles and lived on, shaving their beards and wearing highheeled shoes and pretending to be men. They have mixed with your Telmarines. I am one of those, only a halfDwarf, and if any of my kindred, the true Dwarfs, are still alive anywhere in the world, doubtless they would despise me and call me a traitor. But never in all these years have we forgotten our own people and all the other happy creatures of Narnia, and the long-lost days of freedom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你终于已经明白是怎么回事了吧，”克奈尔斯博士说，“或者，你猜着了。我不是纯种小矮人，我身上也有人类的血液。许多小矮人战后幸存了下来，为了继续生存，他们剃掉胡须，穿上高底靴子，装成人的模样，与你们台尔马人混在一起，我就是其中的一个，只是个半小矮人。假如我的同胞——纯种小矮人——还活在世上的话，他们一定会看不起我的，他们会叫我‘叛徒’。可是，这么多年来，我一刻也没有忘记我的同胞，以及纳尼亚那些愉快的生灵，还有那自you自在的生活。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All at once Caspian realized the truth and felt that he ought to have realized it long before. Doctor Cornelius was so small, and so fat, and had such a very long beard. Two thoughts came into his head at the same moment. One was a thought of terror -- "He's not a real man, not a man at all, he's a Dwarf, and he's brought me up here to kill me." The other was sheer delight -- "There are real Dwarfs still, and I've seen one at last."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾恍然大悟——怎么没能早些发现这个事实呢！克奈尔斯博士身材那么矮小，又那么胖，还有那么又长又密的胡子。他的脑子里一下闪出两个念头。“眼前的这个克奈尔斯博士是个小矮人，他把我带到这里来，是想要杀掉我。”想到这里，他禁不住有点害怕。另一个念头倒很令人高兴“果然有小矮人活了下来，我终于亲眼见到了一个。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am not saying these things in blame of you, dear Prince," answered the Doctor. "You may well ask why I say them at all. But I have two reasons. Firstly, because my old heart has carried these secret memories so long that it aches with them and would burst if I did not whisper them to you. But secondly, for this: that when you become King you may help us, for I know that you also, Telmarine though you are, love the Old Things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我讲这些并没有责备你的意思，亲爱的王子，”博士答道，“你倒是应该问一问，我为什么要对你讲这些。我有两个理由。第一，我这颗衰老的心把这些秘密藏得实在太久了，久得使它隐隐作痛，我要是不悄悄地对你讲出来，我就要憋死了！第二，我希望当你成为国王时，你能帮助我们，因为我深信你虽然是一个台尔马人，但你同样热爱过去的一切。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can be kind to the poor remnants of the Dwarf people, like myself. You can gather learned magicians and try to find a way of awaking the trees once more. You can search through all the nooks and wild places of the land to see if any Fauns or Talking Beasts or Dwarfs are perhaps still alive in hiding."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可以仁慈地对待小矮人家族那些可怜的幸存者：你可以召集那些有学问的魔法师，想办法找到一个重新唤醒树神的秘诀：你可以找遍这块国土上的每一个角落，看是不是还有羊怪、会讲话的动物和小矮人。他们可能藏在什么地方默默地生存着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm -- I'm sorry, Doctor," said Caspian. "It wasn't my fault, you know."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know -- I don't know," said the Doctor with a deep sigh. "Sometimes I am afraid there can't be. I have been looking for traces of them all my life. Sometimes I have thought I heard a Dwarf-drum in the mountains. Sometimes at night, in the woods, I thought I had caught a glimpse of Fauns and Satyrs dancing a long way off; but when I came to the place, there was never anything there. I have often despaired; but something always happens to start me hoping again. I don't know. But at least you can try to be a King like the High King Peter of old, and not like your uncle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道……不知道，”博士深深地叹了一口气，“有时候我也怀疑他们是否还存在，我一生都在寻找他们的踪迹。有时我好像听到了山中小矮人们的鼓声：有时，在夜里，在森林中，我好像看到了羊怪和林中仙女在远远的地方跳舞。可是，当我走过去时，那儿却空空荡荡，什么也没有了。我总是感到失望，可随后又不断有类似的事情发生，燃起我心中的希望之火。我也不知道究竟这世上还有没有他们存在，可是至少你可以努力做一位像古代彼得国王那样的贤明君主，可不要学你的叔父。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nay, my dear," said the old man. "This castle is a thing of yesterday. Your great-great-grandfather built it. But when the two sons of Adam and the two daughters of Eve were made Kings and Queens of Narnia by Aslan himself, they lived in the castle of Cair Paravel. No man alive has seen that blessed place and perhaps even the ruins of it have now vanished. But we believe it was far from here, down at the mouth of the Great River, on the very shore of the sea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我亲爱的孩子，”老人说，“这座城堡只是近些年你曾祖父修建的。当阿斯兰加封亚当的两个儿子和夏娃的两个女儿为国王和女王之后，他们就一直住在凯尔帕拉维尔城堡，没人见过那神圣的地方，或许就连它的废墟现在也找不到了。可是，我们相信那地方离这儿十分遥远，在大河入海之处。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your Highness speaks as you have been taught," said the Doctor. "But it is all lies. There are no ghosts there. That is a story invented by the Telmarines. Your Kings are in deadly fear of the sea because they can never quite forget that in all stories Aslan comes from over the sea. They don't want to go near it and they don't want anyone else to go near it. So they have let great woods grow up to cut their people off from the coast. But because they have quarrelled with the trees they are afraid of the woods. And because they are afraid of the woods they imagine that they are full of ghosts. And the Kings and great men, hating both the sea and the wood, partly believe these stories, and partly encourage them. They feel safer if no one in Narnia dares to go down to the coast and look out to sea towards Aslan's land and the morning and the eastern end of the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“王子殿下，看来有人曾经向你讲过一些谎话，”博士说，“那里根本就没有鬼，那是台尔马人编出来的一派胡言。你们的国王们对那大海怕得要命，因为他们总也忘不掉有关过去的传说中，都少不了阿斯兰会从海外归来，惩处邪恶，伸张正义。他们自己不敢走近大海，也不希望其他任何人走近它。因此，他们任那里长起茂密的森林，好把他们的人民与海岸隔开。由于和树神的冲突，他们害怕森林，所以他们想象出那里到处都是鬼魂。历代国王和那些大臣们，由于仇视、惧怕大海和森林，就编造了这些谎言，如果谁都不敢到海边去看大海，去遥望阿斯兰的土地和东方初升的太阳，他们就会感到安全一些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
