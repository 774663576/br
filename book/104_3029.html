<div class="line_en">"Lo! Lola! Lolita!" I hear myself crying from a doorway into the sun, with the acoustics of time, domed time, endowing my call and its tell-tale hoarseness with such a wealth of anxiety, passion and pain that really it would have been instrumental in wrenching open the zipper of her nylon shroud had she been dead. Lolita! In the middle of a trim turfed terrace I found her at last -- she had run out before I was ready.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh Lolita! There she was playing with a damned dog, not me. The animal, a terrier of sorts, was losing and snapping up again and adjusting between his jaws a wet little red ball; he took rapid chords with his front paws on the resilient turf, and then would bounce away. I had only wanted to see where she was, I could not swim with my heart in that state, but who cared -- and there she was, and there was I, in my robe -- and so I stopped calling; but suddenly something in the pattern of her motions, as she dashed this way and that in her Aztec Red bathing briefs and bra, struck me… there was an ecstasy, a madness about her frolics that was too much of a glad thing. Even the dog seemed puzzled by the extravagance of her reactions. I put a gentle hand to my chest as I surveyed the situation. The turquoise blue swimming pool some distance behind the lawn was no longer behind that lawn, but within my thorax, and my organs swam in it like excrements in the blue sea water in Nice. One of the bathers had left the pool and, half-concealed by the peacocked shade of trees, stood quite still, holding the ends of the towel around his neck and following Lolita with his amber eyes. There he stood, in the camouflage of sun and shade, disfigured by them and masked by his own nakedness, his damp black hair or what was left of it, glued to his round head, his little mustache a humid smear, the wool on his chest spread like a symmetrical trophy, his naval pulsating, his hirsute thighs dripping with bright droplets, his tight wet black bathing trunks bloated and bursting with vigor where his great fat bullybag was pulled up and back like a padded shield over his reversed beasthood. And as I looked at his oval nut-brown face, it dawned upon me that what I had recognized him by was the reflection of my daughter's countenance -- the same beatitude and grimace but made hideous by his maleness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噢洛丽塔！她在那儿和一条该死的狗玩呢，不是和我。那牲灵是一种小猎狗，正玩着一个湿乎乎的小红球，丢掉又叼起，咬来咬去。我只是想看看她在哪儿，我的心在那种境界中不能畅游，但谁又在意——她在那儿，我在那儿，穿着我的睡衣——于是我停止了呼叫；她穿着她的阿兹特克红色泳装短裤和乳罩东跑西跳，突然间，她的姿态有什么震动了我……是一种颜狂，她嬉笑过度，那简直不是件好事。甚至连狗似乎也为她的夸张举动弄得大惑不解了。我观察着局势，将一支温热的手放在胸口上。草坪后面隔开一段距离的绿松石天蓝色游泳池，不再位于草坪后面，而是在我的胸膛内，我的身体在里边游荡，象大便飘浮在尼斯蓝色的海水中。有一位泳者离开了游泳池，一半身体被大树繁茂的浓荫所遮蔽，他稳稳地站着，抓着缠在脖上的浴巾两端，一对琥珀色的眼眼紧紧追踪着洛丽塔。池那么站着，隐蔽在太阳和树影里，模样不清，只显出裸露的部分，他湿漉漉的黑发粘在他的圆头上，他的小八字胡是一个潮湿的油点，他胸口上的汗毛象分布匀称的一片奖品，他的肚脐有规律地跳动着，多毛的大腿滴落着晶莹的水珠，他浸湿的紧身黑色游泳裤鼓着，精气胀裂，一副肥硕的胸，后背象一面软垫的盾，盖住他正面的兽性。正当我打量着他椭圆形胡桃色的脸，我忽而恍然了，我之所以认出了他，正是我女儿面部表情的反应——同样的祝福，做同样的鬼脸，只是他的样子使这一切都甚为丑陋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And I also knew that the child, my child, knew he was looking, enjoyed the lechery of his look and was putting on a show of gambol and glee, the vile and beloved slut. As she made for the ball and missed it, she fell on her back, with her obscene young legs madly pedalling in the air; I could sense the musk of her excitement from where I stood, and then I saw (petrified with a kind of sacred disgust) the man close his eyes and bare his small, horribly small and even, teeth as he leaned against a tree in which a multitude of dappled Priaps shivered. Immediately afterwards a marvelous transformation took place. He was no longer the satyr but a very good-natured and foolish Swiss cousin, the Gustave Trapp I have mentioned more than once, who used to counteract his "sprees" (he drank beer with milk, the good swine) by feats of weight-lifting -- tottering and grunting on a lake beach with his otherwise very complete bathing suit jauntily stripped from one shoulder. This Trapp noticed me from afar and working the towel on his nape walked back with false insouciance to the pool. And as if the sun had gone out of the game, Lo slackened and slowly got up ignoring the ball that the terrier placed before her. Who can say what heartbreaks are caused in a dog by our discontinuing a romp? I started to say something, and then sat down on the grass with a quite monstrous pain in my chest and vomited a torrent of browns and greens that I had never remembered eating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也知道这孩子，我的孩子，明白他在看她，却沉醉于他色迷迷的目光，故意表演了一通蹦跳和欢快，这下贱又迷人的浪荡女。她够那只球却失了手，仰面朝天摔了一跤，她猥亵的一双嫩腿疯了似地在空中荡来荡去；从我站的地方，就可以觉出她兴奋的麝香气息，而后我看见（因一种神圣的厌恶而惊呆了）那男的闭上了眼睛，露出他小而平整的牙齿，靠在一棵树边，树上一群有斑点的技极颤抖起来。不久，一个奇异的变化发生了。他不再是只色狼，而是天性善良忠厚的瑞士表兄，古斯塔夫。特拉普，我已经提过不止一次了，他过去总是以增加体重的功苦抵制他的“狂欢”（他喝啤酒加牛奶，这头棒猪）——在湖边上跌跌绊绊，叽哩咕噜，他那套缺一只肩膀的游泳衣漂亮极了。这位特拉普在远处瞥见我，把浴衣搭到背上，又假装无忧无虑地走回游泳池。仿佛是太阳撤出了比赛，洛懒洋洋的，慢慢地站起来，对小猎狗放到她前面的球弃之不睬。谁能说出我们这位半途而废的顽皮姑娘令一条狗多么心痛欲碎？我说了几句，而后坐在草地上，胸口剧痛，吐出一大堆褐色和绿色物，我从不记得何时吃过这些东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw Lolita's eyes, and they seemed to be more calculating than frightened. I heard her saying to a kind lady that her father was having a fit. Then for a long time I lay in a lounge chair swallowing pony upon pony of gin. And next morning I felt strong enough to drive on (which in later years no doctor believed).</div>
