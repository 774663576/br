<div class="line_en">I once sacrificed my life to keep my parents' promise. This means nothing to you, because to you promises mean nothing. A daughter can promise to come to dinner, but if she has a headache, if she has a traffic jam, if she wants to watch a favorite movie on TV, she no longer has a promise.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this same war movie, the American soldier goes home and he falls to his knees asking another girl to marry him.

<div class="line_en">This was not my case. Instead, the village matchmaker came to my family when I was just two years old. No, nobody told me this, I remember it all. It was summertime, very hot and dusty outside, and I could hear cicadas crying in the yard. We were under some trees in our orchard. The servants and my brothers were picking pears high above me. And I was sitting in my mother's hot sticky arms. I was waving my hand this way and that, because in front of me floated a small bird with horns and colorful paper-thin wings. And then the paper bird flew away and in front of me were two ladies. I remember them because one lady made watery "shrrhh, shrrhh" sounds. When I was older, I came to recognize this as a Peking accent, which sounds quite strange to Taiyuan people's ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, now I know the tree-trunk lady was the old village matchmaker, and the other was Huang Taitai, the mother of the boy I would be forced to marry. No, it's not true what some Chinese say about girl babies being worthless. It depends on what kind of girl baby you are. In my case, people could see my value. I looked and smelled like a precious buncake, sweet with a good clean color.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two ladies were looking at my face without talking. The lady with the watery voice had a painted face that was melting. The other lady had the dry face of an old tree trunk. She looked first at me, then at the painted lady.</div>

<div class="line_en">This is how I became betrothed to Huang Taitai's son, who I later discovered was just a baby, one year younger than I. His name was Tyan-yu -- tyan for "sky," because he was so important, and yu, meaning "leftovers," because when he was born his father was very sick and his family thought he might die. Tyan-yu would be the leftover of his father's spirit. But his father lived and his grandmother was scared the ghosts would turn their attention to this baby boy and take him instead. So they watched him carefully, made all his decisions, and he became very spoiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，我与洪太太的儿子订婚了。后来我才知道，他比当时的我，还要小一岁，只是一个襁褓里的小毛头。他名叫天余，那个“天”字，足以说明他有多么尊贵重要，“余”，就是剩余的意思。因为他出世时，正是他父亲病危，家里人害怕他会死，而天余，将保存他父亲尚未散尽的精魂。岂料他父亲的病后来好了。他祖母担心那些阴府小鬼不甘心，会在天余身上索命偿抵，因此对他倍加爱护，成天含在嘴里怕化掉，托在手里怕吹掉，反正对他百依百顺，他完全给宠坏了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And this is when Huang Taitai looked down at me with a cloudy face as though she could penetrate my thoughts and see my future intentions. I will never forget her look. Her eyes opened wide, she searched my face carefully and then she smiled. I could see a large gold tooth staring at me like the blinding sun and then the rest of her teeth opened wide as if she were going to swallow me down in one piece.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洪太太只是沉着脸，俯首凑着我左右端详着，似在掂估着，一旦联上这份姻亲，将是福是祸？我一辈子也忘不了她当时那副神情，一对骨碌碌的睁得滚圆的眼睛，在我面前晃来晃去，细细察看过我一番后，她终于咧嘴笑了，一颗亮灿灿的大金牙，炫得我眼睛生疼，看她那龇牙咧嘴的模样，就像恨不得把我一口吞下似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even if I had known I was getting such a bad husband, I had no choice, now or later. That was how backward families in the country were. We were always the last to give up stupid old-fashioned customs. In other cities already, a man could choose his own wife, with his parents' permission of course. But we were cut off from this type of new thought. You never heard if ideas were better in another city, only if they were worse. We were told stories of sons who were so influenced by bad wives that they threw their old, crying parents out into the street. So, Taiyuanese mothers continued to choose their daughters-in-law, ones who would raise proper sons, care for the old people, and faithfully sweep the family burial grounds long after the old ladies had gone to their graves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使后来我知道我将嫁给这么个糟糕的男人做妻子，可我却不敢违抗，只能认命。现在我才了解，当时乡下的守旧老式的家庭，就是这样的。我们家的生活节奏，总要比其他人慢几个节拍，恪守迂腐愚蠢的旧俗。在当时有些城市，男人家已能自由选择自己的妻子，当然最后还是要得到父母的允许。可这种新思潮与我们家无缘。因此对其他城市的种种新时代气息根本也无从嗅到，就是听到的那点片言只语，也被指责为伤风败俗之谈。街坊们都在流传着这一类故事，讲的是那些儿子们，是如何受老婆的挑唆，不顾年迈的双亲苦苦哀求，将他们赶出大门。因此，太原的母亲们，宁可遵循自己挑儿媳的旧俗，挑个能管好自个丈夫，又孝顺公婆，能持续夫家香火的媳妇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was actually a very obedient child, but sometimes I had a sour look on my face -- only because I was hot or tired or very ill.

<div class="line_en">I didn't see my future husband until I was eight or nine. The world that I knew was our family compound in the village outside of Taiyuan. My family lived in a modest two-story house with a smaller house in the same compound, which was really just two side-by-side rooms for our cook, an everyday servant, and their families. Our house sat on a little hill. We called this hill Three Steps to Heaven, but it was really just centuries of hardened layers of mud washed up by the Fen River. On the east wall of our compound was the river, which my father said liked to swallow little children. He said it had once swallowed the whole town of Taiyuan. The river ran brown in the summer. In the winter, the river was blue-green in the narrow fast-moving spots. In the wider places, it was frozen still, white with cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">So I didn't have instant love for my future husband the way you see on television today. I thought of this boy more like a troublesome cousin. I learned to be polite to the Huangs and especially to Huang Taitai. My mother would push me toward Huang Taitai and say, "What do you say to your mother?" And I would be confused, not knowing which mother she meant. So I would turn to my real mother and say, "Excuse me, Ma," and then I would turn to Huang Taitai and present her with a little goodie to eat, saying, "For you, Mother." I remember it was once a lump of syaumei, a little dumpling I loved to eat. My mother told Huang Taitai I had made this dumpling especially for her, even though I had only poked its steamy sides with my finger when the cook poured it onto the serving plate.</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked closer and stared at the house that would be my home for the rest of my life. The house had been in the family for many generations. It was not really so old or remarkable, but I could see it had grown up along with the family. There were four stories, one for each generation: great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, and children. The house had a confused look. It had been hastily built and then rooms and floors and wings and decorations had been added on in every which manner, reflecting too many opinions. The first level was built of river rocks held together by straw-filled mud. The second and third levels were made of smooth bricks with an exposed walkway to give it the look of a palace tower. And the top level had gray slab walls topped with a red tile roof. To make the house seem important, there were two large round pillars holding up a veranda entrance to the front door. These pillars were painted red, as were the wooden window borders. Someone, probably Huang Taitai, had added imperial dragon heads at the corners of the roof.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside, the house held a different kind of pretense. The only nice room was a parlor on the first floor, which the Huangs used to receive guests. This room contained tables and chairs carved out of red lacquer, fine pillows embroidered with the Huang family name in the ancient style, and many precious things that gave the look of wealth and old prestige.

I would strain this juice myself into a bowl, never adding any water. I gave this to him for breakfast, murmuring good wishes about his health.

He had no desire for me, but it was his fear that made me think he had no desire for any woman. He was like a little boy who had never grown up. After a while I was no longer afraid. I even began to think differently toward Tyan-yu. It was not like the way a wife loves a husband, but more like the way a sister protects a younger brother. I put my gown back on and lay down next to him and rubbed his back. I knew I no longer had to be afraid. I was sleeping with Tyanyu. He would never touch me and I had a comfortable bed to sleep on.</div>

The matchmaker examined me closely, looked up my birthdate and the hour of my birth, and then asked Huang Taitai about my nature. Finally, the matchmaker gave her conclusions: "It's clear what has happened. A woman can have sons only if she is deficient in one of the elements. Your daughter-in-law was born with enough wood, fire, water, and earth, and she was deficient in metal, which was a good sign.
