<div class="line_en">The, to Carrie, very important theatrical performance was to take place at the Avery on conditions which were to make it more noteworthy than was at first anticipated. The little dramatic student had written to Hurstwood the very morning her part was brought her that she was going to take part in a play.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对嘉莉来说至关重要的这场戏要在阿佛莱礼堂上演。某些情况使得这场演出比原来预料的要引人注目。那个戏剧界的小学生收到台词的第二天早晨就写信告诉赫斯渥，她将在一个戏里演一个角色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," he said, "that's fine. I'm glad to hear it. Of course, you will do well, you're so clever."</div>

<div class="line_en">He answered at once, making a pleasant reference to her ability. "I haven't the slightest doubt you will make a success. You must come to the park to-morrow morning and tell me all about it."</div>

<div class="line_en">He had truly never seen so much spirit in the girl before. Her tendency to discover a touch of sadness had for the nonce disappeared. As she spoke her eyes were bright, her cheeks red. She radiated much of the pleasure which her undertakings gave her. For all her misgivings -- and they were as plentiful as the moments of the day -- she was still happy. She could not repress her delight in doing this little thing which, to an ordinary observer, had no importance at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他确实从没见过她像现在这样神采飞扬。她往日那种淡淡的忧伤现在一扫而空了。她说话时眼睛在闪光，脸蛋红朴朴的，浑身洋溢着演戏给她带来的欢乐。尽管她有种种担心——这些担心时时萦绕心头——她仍然感到兴奋。尽管在一般人眼里这事情无足轻重，她却无法克制她的快乐情绪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie was now lightened by a touch of this divine afflatus. She drew to herself commendation from her two admirers which she had not earned. Their affection for her naturally heightened their perception of what she was trying to do and their approval of what she did. Her inexperience conserved her own exuberant fancy, which ran riot with every straw of opportunity, making of it a golden divining rod whereby the treasure of life was to be discovered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神圣的灵感使嘉莉变得神采奕奕。她还没做什么事，她的两个情人已经对她大加夸赞了。他们既然爱她，她所做的事在他们眼里当然就变得很了不起，值得大肆赞扬了。她则由于年轻无知充满着幻想。这些幻想一遇机会就会泛滥起来，于是一个小小的机会就好像成了金色的魔杖，可以用来发掘生活的宝藏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This interest of the manager was a large thing in itself for the performance, for his standing among the Elks was something worth talking about. Already he was thinking of a box with some friends, and flowers for Carrie. He would make it a dress-suit affair and give the little girl a chance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位经理对演出发生了兴趣，这事本身就非同小可。因为他在兄弟会里地位显要，值得一提。他已经在打算要邀些朋友去订一个包厢，向嘉莉献花。他要让这场演出成为一个社交盛会，给这个小姑娘一个露脸的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within a day or two, Drouet dropped into the Adams Street resort, and he was at once spied by Hurstwood. It was at five in the afternoon and the place was crowded with merchants, actors, managers, politicians, a goodly company of rotund, rosy figures, silk-hatted, starchy-bosomed, beringed and bescarfpinned to the queen's taste. John L. Sullivan, the pugilist, was at one end of the glittering bar, surrounded by a company of loudly dressed sports, who were holding a most animated conversation. Drouet came across the floor with a festive stride, a new pair of tan shoes squeaking audibly at his progress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔了一两天，杜洛埃顺路来到亚当街上这家酒楼。他刚到，赫斯渥就看到了。当时是下午5点，酒馆里挤满了商人、演员、经理、政客。满厅是脸色红润大腹便便的人群，都戴着丝礼帽，穿着浆过的衬衫，手上戴着戒指，领带上别着饰针，真是尽善尽美，无可挑剔。那个著名的拳击家约翰·沙立文正站在酒柜的一端，周围站着许多服装鲜艳的运动员，他们正在热烈交谈。杜洛埃迈着大步，满面春风地穿过大厅，脚上那双黄褐色的新皮鞋走起路来发出喀嚓喀嚓的响声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie, meanwhile, attended the first rehearsal. At this performance Mr. Quincel presided, aided by Mr. Millice, a young man who had some qualifications of past experience, which were not exactly understood by any one. He was so experienced and so business-like, however, that he came very near being rude -- failing to remember, as he did, that the individuals he was trying to instruct were volunteer players and not salaried underlings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在此期间，嘉莉参加了第一次排演。排演由昆塞尔先生主持，一个年轻人米勒斯先生给他当助手。米勒斯过去在演艺圈干过，有一点资历了，不过究竟有些什么资历旁人就不清楚了。可是，他因为自己有点经验，又摆出一副公事公办的面孔，所以他的态度几近粗暴——事实上，他忘记了自己指导的只是一群业余演员，并不是领工资的下属。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carrie did not exactly fancy the suggestion, but the novelty of the situation, the presence of strangers, all more or less nervous, and the desire to do anything rather than make a failure, made her timid.

<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉并不喜欢他的这个提示。但是这种场面太新奇，又有那么多陌生人在场，每人多少有点紧张，再加上她竭力想避免演砸，这一切使她胆怯起来，不敢提出反对意见。她照着导演的要求走动着，心里却感到这么走缺少了点什么东西，令人不自在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rehearsal ended for one day, and Carrie went home feeling that she had acquitted herself satisfactorily. The words of the director were ringing in her ears, and she longed for an opportunity to tell Hurstwood. She wanted him to know just how well she was doing. Drouet, too, was an object for her confidences. She could hardly wait until he should ask her, and yet she did not have the vanity to bring it up. The drummer, however, had another line of thought to-night, and her little experience did not appeal to him as important. He let the conversation drop, save for what she chose to recite without solicitation, and Carrie was not good at that. He took it for granted that she was doing very well and he was relieved of further worry. Consequently he threw Carrie into repression, which was irritating. She felt his indifference keenly and longed to see Hurstwood. It was as if he were now the only friend she had on earth. The next morning Drouet was interested again, but the damage had been done.</div>
