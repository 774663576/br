<div class="line_en">The sun was so deeply buried behind the clouds that there was no way to tell if it had set or not. After the long flight -- chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky -- it was especially disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings, signaling that we were nearly home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Renee and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and out was giving my lungs a workout.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蕾妮和我沿着人行道漫无目的地散步，努力躲在稀稀拉拉的棕榈树的树荫下。尽管天色还早，热气却让人透不过气来。空气中的湿气很重，连简单的呼吸都是对我的肺部的考验。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This morning we'd gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She'd also wanted to talk with me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stay indoors during the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天早上我们一起沿着海滩散步，她想要炫耀她的新家所有的迷人之处，仍然希望这里的明媚阳光会把我从福克斯诱惑过来，我是这么想的。她也想要和我单独说说话，这很好办，爱德华编了个要写学期论文的借口待在家里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Phil was busy -- the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs -- and being alone with Edward and me had only sharpened Renee's focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of the way, Renee began to watch. And as she'd watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and then concerned.</div>

<div class="line_en">I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched -- in front of her, at least. I wondered if Renee was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn't mind that the way I had with Charlie. It wasn't embarrassing with my mom. After all, I'd been the one giving her that lecture time and time again in the last ten years.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's something… strange about the way you two are together," she murmured, her forehead creasing over her troubled eyes. "The way he watches you -- it's so… protective. Like he's about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think you're imagining things, Mom," I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter in my stomach. I'd forgotten how much my mother saw. Something about her simple view of the world cut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before. Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn't tell her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想这都是您的想象，妈妈。”我马上说，努力保持轻松的语气。我心里有些焦急，我不知道我妈妈看透了多少。她看待世界简单的方式使她看穿了许多细枝末节，直接洞悉到事物的本质。这以前从来都不会有问题，直到现在，我什么秘密都不能告诉她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No." She frowned as she struggled for the words. "It's just different. He's very intense about you… and very careful. I feel like I don't really understand your relationship. Like there's some secret I'm missing…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”她想找到合适的词语的时候皱起了眉头，“只是不一样。他很关注你……非常小心翼翼。我觉得我并不十分了解你们的关系，好像我错过了什么秘密一样……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The way you move -- you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets… or gravity. You're like a… satellite, or something. I've never seen anything like it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你行为的方式——你甚至想都没想就围绕着他调整自己。他动的时候，哪怕只动一点点，你同时也会调整自己的位置。好像磁铁……或地球引力一样。你们就像……卫星，或类似的事物一样，我从未见过这样的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们在查理的房子前面停了下来。走廊的灯还亮着，巡逻车停在车道上。我仔细查看房子的时候，看见起居室窗户上的窗帘猛地拉了一下，映出一缕淡黄色的光，照在黑黢黢的草坪上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn't miss me that much, even now…</div>

A thousand memories spun in my head, tangling together -- a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretching into the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution -- there was never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper very nearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down the Quileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn't help that Alice's abilities were nullified by the Quileutes' involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if we hadn't gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive. Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisle and Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slipped away. That's everything.</div>
