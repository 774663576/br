<div class="line_en">For a moment she felt utterly dislocated. She did not know where she was; she was not entirely sure who she was. It is astonishing just how much of what we are can be tied to the beds we wake up in in the morning, and it is astonishing how fragile that can be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好一会儿工夫，她一点儿也不明白出了什么事。她不知道她在哪儿，连她自个儿是谁都想不大起来。睡着以后，我们脑子里想的事儿就扔在床上了，第二天早上醒来常常忘了捡起来。人的脑子可真不管用啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline was woken by the mid-morning sun, full on her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上十点钟左右的太阳照在她脸上，卡萝兰醒了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes Coraline would forget who she was while she was daydreaming that she was exploring the Arctic, or the Amazon rainforest, or darkest Africa, and it was not until someone tapped her on the shoulder or said her name that Coraline would come back from a million miles away with a start, and all in a fraction of a second have to remember who she was, and what her name was, and that she was even there at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他时候，卡萝兰也会忘记自己是谁，比如做白日梦在北极探险、深入亚马逊雨林或者黑非洲的时候。只有等到别人在她肩膀上拍一下，她才会吓一大跳，从一百万英里以外回来，再过一点点时间以后才能想起自己是谁，名字叫什么，想起还有她这个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now there was sun on her face, and she was Coraline Jones. Yes. And then the green and pinkness of the room she was in, and the rustling of a large painted paper butterfly as it fluttered and beat its way about the ceiling, told her where she had woken up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，太阳照在她脸上，她是卡萝兰·琼斯。这个绿色房间，加上在天花板上不住扑腾的一只纸做的花蝴蝶，合在一起，终于让她想起了她醒来的地方是哪儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She climbed out of the bed. She could not wear her pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers during the day, she decided, even if it meant wearing the other Coraline's clothes. (Was there an other Coraline? No, she decided, there wasn't. There was just her.) There were no proper clothes in the cupboard, though. They were more like dressing-up clothes or (she thought) the kind of clothes she would love to have hanging in her own wardrobe at home: there was a raggedy witch costume; a patched scarecrow costume; a future-warrior costume with little digital lights on it that glittered and blinked; a slinky evening dress all covered in feathers and mirrors. Finally, in a drawer, she found a pair of black jeans that seemed to be made of velvet night, and a grey sweater the colour of thick smoke with faint and tiny stars in the fabric which twinkled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她爬下床。她觉得，今天不能穿睡裤、睡袍和拖鞋。也就是说，只能穿另一个卡萝兰的衣服。管不了那么多了。（世上到底有没有另一个卡萝兰？她想了想，最后认定没有。没有另一个卡萝兰，只有她一个。）衣橱里没有家常衣服，很多是大场合才会穿的正式衣服。还有一些，如果挂在她自己家的衣橱里，她一准喜欢得要命：一件样式破破烂烂的女巫服；一件稻草人穿的衣服，上面打了许多补丁；还有一件未来战士的衣服，上面还有不少一闪一闪的小灯泡呢。一件漂亮晚装，缀着羽毛和小镜片。最后，她在一个抽屉里找到一条黑色牛仔裤，料子好像是天鹅绒。还有一件灰色套头衫，那种灰色就像大火冒出的浓烟一样，里面还有许多亮闪闪的小火星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No point," said the other father. "There isn't anywhere but here. This is all she made: the house, the grounds, and the people in the house. She made it and she waited." Then he looked embarrassed and he put one finger to his lips again, as if he had just said too much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有意义，”另一位父亲说。“除了这里没有别的地方。这就是她所做的一切：房子，庭院，还有房子里的人。她做了，她等着，”然后他看起来很尴尬，又把一个手指放在嘴唇上，好像他说的太多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She went over to the fireplace, went up on tiptoes, and lifted it down. It was a snow-globe, with two little people in it. Coraline shook it and set the snow flying, white snow that glittered as it tumbled through the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走到壁炉前，踮起脚尖，取下玻璃球。这是一个雪花球，里面有两个小人。卡萝兰摇了一下，马上看到里面雪花飘飘，白色的雪花亮晶晶的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她走出这套房间，走过一扇门，门上围着一圈闪个不停的小灯泡。这扇门后面，另一个斯平克小姐和另一个福斯波尔小姐正一刻不停地表演她们的节目。卡萝兰走进树丛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked around the room. It was so familiar that was what made it feel so truly strange. Everything was exactly the same as she remembered: there was all her grandmother's strange-smelling furniture, there was the painting of the bowl of fruit (a bunch of grapes, two plums, a peach and an apple) hanging on the wall, there was the low wooden table with the lion's feet, and the empty fireplace which seemed to suck heat from the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她四周看了看。这个房间真是太熟了——所以才觉得这么古怪。每一件东西都和她记得的一模一样：奶奶那些气味难闻的家具；墙上挂着水果画（一串葡萄，两颗李子，一个桃子，一个苹果）：那儿是那张矮木桌，桌腿雕成狮子脚爪；还有那个壁炉，好像把房子里的热气儿全吸跑了似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Where Coraline came from, once you were through the patch of trees, you saw nothing but the meadow and the old tennis court. In this place, the woods went on further, the trees becoming cruder and less tree-like the further you went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在卡萝兰来的地方，走过一丛树以后，你看见的是草坪，还有那个破旧的网球场。可在这里，树丛深得多。越往前走，树的样子越吓人，简直不大像树了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took a few moments for her eyes to focus on it properly. She thought it might be some kind of lion, at first, some distance away from her; and then she thought it might be a mouse, close beside her. And then she knew what it was.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“肯定不是雾，”卡萝兰心想，可她也不知道这究竟是什么。有一会儿工夫，她担心自己会不会已经瞎了。没有，她看得见她自己，看得清清楚楚。可她脚下连地都没有，只有一片雾蒙蒙的白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the far end of the hall was the mirror. She could see herself walking towards the mirror, looking, reflected, a little braver than she actually felt. There was nothing else there in the mirror. Just her, in the corridor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other mother shook her head, very slowly. "Sharper than a serpent's tooth," she said, "is a daughter's ingratitude. Still, the proudest spirit can be broken, with love." And her long white fingers waggled and caressed the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Suit yourself," said her other mother.

She crunched it happily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“随你的便好了。”另一个妈妈说。她仔细挑选出一只个子特别大的，扯掉蟑螂腿（她细心地把扯下来的蟑螂腿放进一旁小桌上的一只玻璃大烟缸里），把蟑螂扔进嘴里，高兴地嚼起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her other mother ignored this. "Now, I think you are a little overexcited, Coraline. Perhaps this afternoon we could do a little embroidery together, or some watercolour painting. Then dinner, and then, if you have been good, you may play with the rats a little before bed. And I shall read you a story and tuck you in, and kiss you goodnight." Her long white fingers fluttered gently, like a tired butterfly, and Coraline shivered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个妈妈没理这句话。“我觉得，你可能是兴奋过头了，卡萝兰。也许，到下午的时候，咱们一块儿做点刺绣活儿，要不画水彩画也行。然后吃晚饭。再以后，如果你乖乖的，你还可以在睡觉前跟老鼠们玩一会儿。我还会念故事给你听，替你掖好被子，亲亲你。”长长的手指头不停地动来动去，像飞得慢吞吞的蝴蝶。卡萝兰打了个哆嗦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other mother sat on the sofa. Her mouth was set in a line; her lips were pursed. She popped another blackbeetle into her mouth, and then another, like someone with a bag of chocolate-covered raisins. Her big black-button eyes looked into Coraline's hazel eyes. Her shiny black hair twined and twisted about her neck and shoulders, as if it were blowing in some wind that Coraline could not touch or feel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个妈妈在沙发上坐直了，嘴巴闭成一道线，嘴唇绷得紧紧的。她又往嘴里扔了一只蟑螂，接着又是一只，像别人吃巧克力葡萄干。又大又黑的纽扣眼睛瞪着卡萝兰的淡褐色眼睛。她亮闪闪的黑头发在脖子和肩膀周围动来动去，像有风吹着似的。可卡萝兰没觉得有风。两人瞪着对方，瞪了一分钟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stared at each other for over a minute. Then the other mother said, "Manners!" She folded the white paper bag, carefully, so no blackbeetles could escape, and she placed it back in the shopping bag. Then she stood up, and up, and up: she seemed taller than Coraline remembered. She reached into her apron pocket and pulled out first the black door key, which she frowned at and tossed into her handbag, then a tiny silver-coloured key. She held it up triumphantly. "There we are," she said. "This is for you, Coraline. For your own good. Because I love you. To teach you manners. Manners makyth man, after all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，另一个妈妈说：“没礼貌！”她小心地折起白纸口袋，让蟑螂逃不出来，再把它放进购物袋。然后，她站起身，身子向上，向上，比卡萝兰记得的更高。她的手伸进围裙兜里，向外掏东西。先掏出来的是那把黑钥匙。她皱着眉头瞧了瞧它，把它扔进那只购物袋。接着又掏出一把银色的小钥匙。她高兴地举起钥匙，“找到了。”她说，“这是给你准备的，卡萝兰。为你好。因为我爱你，所以才要教你懂礼貌。一个人怎么样，一看他有没有礼貌就知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
