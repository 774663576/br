<div class="line_en">The sound of Lord Janos Slynt clearing his throat broke the strained silence. "Your Grace, let me say how pleased we are to be summoned here. When I saw your banners from the Wall, I knew the realm was saved. 'There comes a man who neer forgets his duty/ I said to good Ser Alliser. 'A strong man, and a true king.'

<div class="line_en">I have no place here, Sam thought anxiously, when her red eyes fell upon him. Someone had to help Maester Aemon up the steps. Don't look at me, I'm just the maester's steward. The others were contenders for the Old Bear's command, all but Bowen Marsh, who had withdrawn from the contest but remained castellan and Lord Steward. Sam did not understand why Melisandre should seem so interested in him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The singers may do as they like," Stannis snapped. "Spare me your fawning, Janos, it will not serve you." He rose to his feet and frowned at them all. "Lady Melisandre tells me that you have not yet chosen a Lord Commander. I am displeased. How much longer must this folly last?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“歌手们爱干什么就干什么，”史坦尼斯打断他，“少拍马屁，杰诺斯，没用。”他站起身，朝所有人皱眉头。“梅莉珊卓女士告诉我，你们到现在还没选出总司令，让我很不愉快。这件蠢事还要拖多久？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He should, yes," said Janos Slynt. "But it must be said. We brothers are only simple soldiers. Soldiers, yes! And Your Grace will know that soldiers are most comfortable taking orders. They would benefit from your royal guidance, it seems to me. For the good of the realm. To help them choose wisely."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，没错，”杰诺斯·史林特说，“但我们的弟兄不过是些单纯的士兵。士兵，对！陛下很清楚，士兵以服从命令为天职。依我之见，若陛下不吝赐教，想必他们能从中受益。请为了王国的未来，帮大家作出明智的选择吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The suggestion outraged some of the others. "Do you want the king to wipe our arses for us too?" said Cotter Pyke angrily. "The choice of a Lord Commander belongs to the Sworn Brothers, and to them alone," insisted Ser Denys Mallister. "If they choose wisely they won't be choosing me," moaned Dolorous Edd. Maester Aemon, calm as always, said, "Your Grace, the Night's Watch has been choosing its own leader since Brandon the Builder raised the Wall. Through Jeor Mormont we have had nine hundred and ninety-seven Lords Commander in unbroken succession, each chosen by the men he would lead, a tradition many thousands of years old."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这建议惹恼了其他人。“你要让国王给我们揩屁股吗？”卡特·派克愤怒地质问。“选择总司令的权力属于且仅属于誓言效命的黑衣弟兄。”丹尼斯·梅利斯特爵士强调。“如果他们明智的话，就不会选我了。”‘忧郁的’艾迪嘀咕。伊蒙学士一如既往地平静，“陛下，自‘筑城者’布兰登修建长城以来，守夜人的领袖一直由自己选举，到杰奥·莫尔蒙为止，已有连续九百九十七任总司令，每一位都由他将要领导的人们选出，这是承继数千年之久的传统。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That took Lord Janos aback. He smiled uncertainly and began to sweat, but Bowen Marsh beside him said, "Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话吓退了杰诺斯大人。他不知所措地笑笑，额头开始冒汗，但身旁的波文·马尔锡道：“有谁比曾指挥过金袍卫士的他更有资格带领黑衣军团呢，陛下？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Any of you, I would think. Even the cook." The look the king gave Slynt was cold. "Janos was hardly the first gold cloak ever to take a bribe, I grant you, but he may have been the first commander to fatten his purse by selling places and promotions. By the end he must have had half the officers in the City Watch paying him part of their wages. Isn't that so, Janos?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们中任何一个，甚至那厨子都比他强。”国王冷冷地看着史林特。“我保证，杰诺斯不是头一个受贿的金袍子，但很可能是头一个靠出卖职位和肥缺赚得盆满钵溢的司令。到最后，都城守备队里半数军官都得将自己一部分薪水交给他。是不是这样，杰诺斯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stannis ground his teeth. "It is not my wish to tamper with your rights and traditions. As to royal guidance, Janos, if you mean that I ought to tell your brothers to choose you, have the courage to say so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯咬紧牙关，“我无意篡夺你们的权力和传统。至于‘陛下的赐教’，杰诺斯，如果要我强迫弟兄们选你，就该大胆地说出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Two men who were prepared to come forward died suddenly on their rounds." Stannis narrowed his eyes. "Do not trifle with me, my lord. I saw the proof Jon Arryn laid before the small council. If I had been king you would have lost more than your office, I promise you, but Robert shrugged away your little lapses. 'They all steal/ I recall him saying. 'Better a thief we know than one we don't, the next man might be worse.' Lord Petyr's words in my brother's mouth, I'll warrant. Littlefinger had a nose for gold, and I'm certain he arranged matters so the crown profited as much from your corruption as you did yourself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“两个准备站出来的人突然在巡逻时死了。”史坦尼斯眯起眼睛。“别把我当傻瓜，大人，我见过琼恩·艾林呈给御前会议的证据。如果我是国王，你失去的就不只是职位了，我保证，但劳勃轻易放过了你的‘小过错’。‘他们全都是小偷，’我记得他说，‘明目张胆的好歹比藏着掖着的好，下一个也许更糟呢。’哼，毫无疑问，这是培提尔伯爵用我哥哥的嘴巴在说话，小指头对金钱向来敏感，说不定他利用你贪污获得的利益不比你自己所得的少。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Many of my brothers have proved themselves in battle. It is not enough. Some matters cannot be settled with a battleaxe. Maester Aemon will understand that, though Cotter Pyke does not. The Lord Commander of the Night's Watch is a lord, first and foremost. He must be able to treat with other lords… and with kings as well. He must be a man worthy of respect." Ser Denys leaned forward. "We are the sons of great lords, you and I. We know the importance of birth, blood, and that early training that can ne'er be replaced. I was a squire at twelve, a knight at eighteen, a champion at two-and-twenty. I have been the commander at the Shadow Tower for thirty-three years. Blood, birth, and training have fitted me to deal with kings. Pyke… well, did you hear him this morning, asking if His Grace would wipe his bottom? Samwell, it is not my habit to speak unkindly of my brothers, but let us be frank… the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves, and Cotter Pyke was raping and murdering when he was still half a boy. Maester Harmune reads and writes his letters, and has for years. No, loath as I am to disappoint Maester Aemon, I could not in honor stand aside for Pyke of Eastwatch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“许多弟兄在战斗中证明了自己，那是不够的，有些事无法靠斧头解决，伊蒙师傅了解，但卡特·派克不明白。守夜人军团的总司令必须是领袖，必须具备跟其他贵族…以及国王打交道的能力。他必须赢得别人尊重。”丹尼斯爵士倾身向前。“你我都是诸侯的子嗣，我们都清楚出身、血统以及早期教育的重要性，那是练武所无法替代的。我十二岁成为侍从，十八岁当上骑士，二十二岁赢得比武大会的冠军，而指挥影子塔业已三十三年。血统、出身和教育使我具备跟国王打交道的能力。派克…唉，你记得今天早晨他说的话吗，‘你要让国王给我们揩屁股吗’？山姆威尔，非议弟兄并非我的习惯，但让我们坦白说吧…铁民是海盗与窃贼的民族，卡特·派克从小干的就是奸淫杀戮之事，多年以来，连读写信件都全部交由哈慕恩师傅负责。不，虽然不想让伊蒙师傅失望，但我无法说服自己为东海望的派克让路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Denys considered a moment. "I have never desired the honor for its own sake. At the last choosing, I stepped aside gratefully when Lord Mormont's name was offered, just as I had for Lord Qorgyle at the choosing before that. So long as the Night's Watch remains in good hands, I am content. But Bowen Marsh is not equal to the task, no more than Othell Yarwyck. And this so-called Lord of Harrenhal is a butcher's whelp upjumped by the Lannisters. Small wonder he is venal and corrupt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼斯考虑片刻，“我从不贪图荣耀。上次选举，当莫尔蒙大人的名字被提出来，我心悦诚服地放弃，在此之前，也曾为科格尔大人让路。只要守夜人军团操在可靠的人手中，我就心满意足。但波文·马尔锡和奥赛尔·亚威克都不是那样的人，而这所谓的赫伦堡伯爵乃屠夫之子，兰尼斯特家提拔的跳梁小丑，难怪如此堕落腐化。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's another man," Sam blurted out. "Lord Commander Mormont trusted him. So did Donal Noye and Qhorin Halfhand. Though he's not as highly born as you, he comes from old blood. He was castle-born and castle-raised, and he learned sword and lance from a knight and letters from a maester of the Citadel. His father was a lord, and his brother a king."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有一个人，”山姆脱口而出，“莫尔蒙总司令信任他，唐纳·诺伊和‘断掌’科林也信任他。尽管他身份不若你高贵，却也有古老的血统。他在城堡里出生，在城堡里长大，他跟骑士学习剑术与长枪，向学士讨教文字和知识。他的父亲是公爵，他的兄弟乃是国王。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Denys stroked his long white beard. "Mayhaps," he said, after a long moment. "He is very young, but… mayhaps. He might serve, I grant you, though I would be more suitable. I have no doubt of that. I would be the wiser choice."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam was trembling by the time he left the Lance. What have I done? he thought. What have I said? If they caught him in his lie, they would… what? Send me to the Wall?
