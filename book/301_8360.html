<div class="line_en">Siddhartha walked through the forest, was already far from the city, and knew nothing but that one thing, that there was no going back for him, that this life, as he had lived it for many years until now, was over and done away with, and that he had tasted all of it, sucked everything out of it until he was disgusted with it. Dead was the singing bird, he had dreamt of. Dead was the bird in his heart. Deeply, he had been entangled in Sansara, he had sucked up disgust and death from all sides into his body, like a sponge sucks up water until it is full. And full he was, full of the feeling of been sick of it, full of misery, full of death, there was nothing left in this world which could have attracted him, given him joy, given him comfort.</div>

<div class="line_en">Passionately he wished to know nothing about himself anymore, to have rest, to be dead. If there only was a lightning-bolt to strike him dead! If there only was a tiger a devour him! If there only was a wine, a poison which would numb his senses, bring him forgetfulness and sleep, and no awakening from that! Was there still any kind of filth, he had not soiled himself with, a sin or foolish act he had not committed, a dreariness of the soul he had not brought upon himself? Was it still at all possible to be alive? Was it possible, to breathe in again and again, to breathe out, to feel hunger, to eat again, to sleep again, to sleep with a woman again? Was this cycle not exhausted and brought to a conclusion for him?</div>

<div class="line_en">In the same hour of the night, Siddhartha left his garden, left the city, and never came back. For a long time, Kamaswami had people look for him, thinking that he had fallen into the hands of robbers. Kamala had no one look for him. When she was told that Siddhartha had disappeared, she was not astonished. Did she not always expect it? Was he not a Samana, a man who was at home nowhere, a pilgrim? And most of all, she had felt this the last time they had been together, and she was happy, in spite of all the pain of the loss, that she had pulled him so affectionately to her heart for this last time, that she had felt one more time to be so completely possessed and penetrated by him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在当天夜里，席特哈尔塔离开了他的花园，离开了这座城市，再也没有回去。卡马斯瓦密派人找了他很久，以为他落入了强盗之手。卡玛拉没有让人找他。她得知席特哈尔塔失踪时并没有惊讶。她不是一直在盼着这个消息么？原来他不就是一个沙门，一个无家可归的人，一个朝圣者么？在最后那次欢聚时她感受得尤为深刻。她在失败的痛楚中寻欢作乐，最后一次把他紧紧地贴在心口上，再一次感到自己被他完全占有了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He also put an end to this, this also died in him. He rose, bid his farewell to the mango-tree, his farewell to the pleasure-garden. Since he had been without food this day, he felt strong hunger, and thought of his house in the city, of his chamber and bed, of the table with the meals on it. He smiled tiredly, shook himself, and bid his farewell to these things.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she received the first news of Siddhartha's disappearance, she went to the window, where she held a rare singing bird captive in a golden cage. She opened the door of the cage, took the bird out and let it fly. For a long time, she gazed after it, the flying bird. From this day on, she received no more visitors and kept her house locked. But after some time, she became aware that she was pregnant from the last time she was together with Siddhartha.</div>

<div class="line_en">A hang bent over the bank of the river, a coconut-tree; Siddhartha leaned against its trunk with his shoulder, embraced the trunk with one arm, and looked down into the green water, which ran and ran under him, looked down and found himself to be entirely filled with the wish to let go and to drown in these waters. A frightening emptiness was reflected back at him by the water, answering to the terrible emptiness in his soul. Yes, he had reached the end. There was nothing left for him, except to annihilate himself, except to smash the failure into which he had shaped his life, to throw it away, before the feet of mockingly laughing gods. This was the great vomiting he had longed for: death, the smashing to bits of the form he hated! Let him be food for fishes, this dog Siddhartha, this lunatic, this depraved and rotten body, this weakened and abused soul! Let him be food for fishes and crocodiles, let him be chopped to bits by the daemons!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从河岸上探出一棵树，弯着伸向河面，那是一棵椰子树。席特哈尔塔让肩膀靠在树干上，用一只胳臂搂住树干，俯视着身下流过的碧绿的河水。他往下看，感到心中涌动着这个愿望：松开手，让自己沉溺到水里去。从水中映也一种可怕的空虚，而他心中的可怕的空虚则与之呼应。是的，他要完蛋了。留给他的出路就是毁灭自己，砸烂自己生活的失败产物，丢弃它，把它丢到幸灾乐祸的神灵脚下。为正是他所渴望的巨大突破：死亡，毁掉他所憎恶的形体！但愿水中的鱼把他吃掉，把席特哈尔塔这条狗、这个疯子、这个腐朽的身躯、这颗衰微和滥用了的灵魂吃掉！但愿鱼类和鳄鱼把他吃掉，但愿恶魔把他撕成碎片！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Siddhartha reached the large river in the forest, the same river over which a long time ago, when he had still been a young man and came from the town of Gotama, a ferryman had conducted him. By this river he stopped, hesitantly he stood at the bank. Tiredness and hunger had weakened him, and whatever for should he walk on, wherever to, to which goal? No, there were no more goals, there was nothing left but the deep, painful yearning to shake off this whole desolate dream, to spit out this stale wine, to put an end to this miserable and shameful life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔来到森林中的一条大河边，这正是当年他年轻时从戈塔马那个城里出来，一个船夫为他摆渡的那条河。他在河边停下，犹豫不决地站在河岸上。疲劳和饥饿已经使得他虚弱不堪，他干吗还继续走呢？他前往何处，奔什么目标呢？不，已经没有目标了，只有这种深深的痛苦的渴望：甩掉这乱七八糟的梦境，吐掉这变了味的酒，结束这糟糕的可耻的生活！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, out of remote areas of his soul, out of past times of his now weary life, a sound stirred up. It was a word, a syllable, which he, without thinking, with a slurred voice, spoke to himself, the old word which is the beginning and the end of all prayers of the Brahmans, the holy "Om", which roughly means "that what is perfect" or "the completion". And in the moment when the sound of "Om" touched Siddhartha's ear, his dormant spirit suddenly woke up and realized the foolishness of his actions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，从他心灵深处的偏僻角落里，从他这疲倦一生的历历往事中，传来了一个声音。那是一个字，一个音节，他不假思索就喃喃地念了出来。那正是所有婆罗门在祈祷的开头和结尾时都用的古字，那个神圣的“唵”字，意思是“功德圆满”或“完美无瑕”。就在这声“唵”传入席特哈尔塔耳中的一刹那，他那沉睡的心灵突然苏醒了，他看清了自己行为的愚蠢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Siddhartha was deeply shocked. So this was how things were with him, so doomed was he, so much he had lost his way and was forsaken by all knowledge, that he had been able to seek death, that this wish, this wish of a child, had been able to grow in him: to find rest by annihilating his body! What all agony of these recent times, all sobering realizations, all desperation had not brought about, this was brought on by this moment, when the Om entered his consciousness: he became aware of himself in his misery and in his error.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔深感震惊。他现实的境况就是这样，这么无可救药，误入歧途，背离了一切真敌国，以至于他想自寻短见，而这个愿望，这个孩子般的愿望，却在他心中变大起来：不惜毁灭自己的肉体来求得安宁！这最后时刻的全部痛苦、全部醒悟和全部绝望没能实现的东西，却在“唵”闯入他的意识这一瞬间完成了：他在自己的愁苦和迷乱中认识了自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a distorted face, he stared into the water, saw the reflection of his face and spit at it. In deep tiredness, he took his arm away from the trunk of the tree and turned a bit, in order to let himself fall straight down, in order to finally drown. With his eyes closed, he slipped towards death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他面容扭曲地呆望着水面，看见了映出的那张脸，便朝它吐口水。他疲惫不堪，让胳臂松开树干，轻了一下身子，以便垂直地落进水中，最终葬身水底。他沉下去，闭着眼睛，迎向死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但这仅只是一刹那，像一道闪电。席特哈尔塔倒在了那棵椰子树下，把头枕在树根上，陷入了沉沉的梦乡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Deep was his sleep and without dreams, for a long time he had not known such a sleep any more. When he woke up after many hours, he felt as if ten years had passed, he heard the water quietly flowing, did not know where he was and who had brought him here, opened his eyes, saw with astonishment that there were trees and the sky above him, and he remembered where he was and how he got here. But it took him a long while for this, and the past seemed to him as if it had been covered by a veil, infinitely distant, infinitely far away, infinitely meaningless. He only knew that his previous life (in the first moment when he thought about it, this past life seemed to him like a very old, previous incarnation, like an early pre-birth of his present self) -- that his previous life had been abandoned by him, that, full of disgust and wretchedness, he had even intended to throw his life away, but that by a river, under a coconut-tree, he has come to his senses, the holy word Om on his lips, that then he had fallen asleepand had now woken up and was looking at the world as a new man. Quietly, he spoke the word Om to himself, speaking which he had fallen asleep, and it seemed to him as if his entire long sleep had been nothing but a long meditative recitation of Om, a thinking of Om, a submergence and complete entering into Om, into the nameless, the perfected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他睡得很香，没有做梦，他已经很久没有这么酣睡过了。几个小时之后，他醒来了，觉得仿佛已过去了十年。他听见河水的潺潺流淌声，不明白自己身在何处，是谁把他弄到了这儿。他睁开眼睛，看见头顶的树林和天空十分尺度，回想自己是在哪儿，自己是怎么来的。他想了好长一会儿，往事就像被一层薄纱遮着，显得很远很远，无比遥远，完全无关紧要。他只知道自己已抛弃了过去的生活（在他回忆的最初一瞬间，他觉得过去的生活就像是一个遥远过去的化身，就像是他现在这个自我的一个早产儿）——他满怀厌恶与愁闷，甚至想抛弃自己的生命，但是在一条河边，在一棵椰子树下，他口中念育着神圣的“唵”字，回归了自我，然后便沉沉睡去，而现在又醒来了，作为一个新人观看这世界。他低声念诵着曾使他沉沉睡去的“唵”字，觉得他的沉睡只是一声悠长而专注的“唵”的念诵，一次“唵”的思索，是沉入和彻底到达“唵”之中，到达无可名状的完美境界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Siddhartha straightened up, then he saw a person sitting opposite to him, an unknown man, a monk in a yellow robe with a shaven head, sitting in the position of pondering. He observed the man, who had neither hair on his head nor a beard, and he had not observed him for long when he recognised this monk as Govinda, the friend of his youth, Govinda who had taken his refuge with the exalted Buddha. Govinda had aged, he too, but still his face bore the same features, expressed zeal, faithfulness, searching, timidness. But when Govinda now, sensing his gaze, opened his eyes and looked at him, Siddhartha saw that Govinda did not recognise him. Govinda was happy to find him awake; apparently, he had been sitting here for a long time and been waiting for him to wake up, though he did not know him.</div>

The sleep had strengthened him much, but hunger gave him much pain, for by now he had not eaten for two days, and the times were long past when he had been tough against hunger. With sadness, and yet also with a smile, he thought of that time. In those days, so he remembered, he had boasted of three three things to Kamala, had been able to do three noble and undefeatable feats: fasting-waiting-thinking. These had been his possession, his power and strength, his solid staff; in the busy, laborious years of his youth, he had learned these three feats, nothing else. And now, they had abandoned him, none of them was his any more, neither fasting, nor waiting, nor thinking. For the most wretched things, he had given them up, for what fades most quickly, for sensual lust, for the good life, for riches! His life had indeed been strange.

How wondrous is this! Now, that I'm no longer young, that my hair is already half gray, that my strength is fading, now I'm starting again at the beginning and as a child! Again, he had to smile.

<div class="line_en">Wondrous indeed was my life, so he thought, wondrous detours it has taken. As I boy, I had only to do with gods and offerings. As a youth, I had only to do with asceticism, with thinking and meditation, was searching for Brahman, worshipped the eternal in the Atman. But as a young man, I followed the penitents, lived in the forest, suffered of heat and frost, learned to hunger, taught my body to become dead. Wonderfully, soon afterwards, insight came towards me in the form of the great Buddha's teachings, I felt the knowledge of the oneness of the world circling in me like my own blood. But I also had to leave Buddha and the great knowledge. I went and learned the art of love with Kamala, learned trading with Kamaswami, piled up money, wasted money, learned to love my stomach, learned to please my senses. I had to spend many years losing my spirit, to unlearn thinking again, to forget the oneness. Isn't it just as if I had turned slowly and on a long detour from a man into a child, from a thinker into a childlike person? And yet, this path has been very good; and yet, the bird in my chest has not died. But what a path has this been! I had to pass through so much stupidity, through so much vices, through so many errors, through so much disgust and disappointments and woe, just to become a child again and to be able to start over. But it was right so, my heart says "Yes" to it, my eyes smile to it. I've had to experience despair, I've had to sink down to the most foolish one of all thoughts, to the thought of suicide, in order to be able to experience divine grace, to hear Om again, to be able to sleep properly and awake properly again. I had to become a fool, to find Atman in me again. I had to sin, to be able to live again. Where else might my path lead me to? It is foolish, this path, it moves in loops, perhaps it is going around in a circle. Let it go as it likes, I want to to take it.</div>

He had now, so he felt, in these recent times and days, completely tasted and spit out, devoured up to the point of desperation and death, a piece of suffering, a piece of misery. Like this, it was good. For much longer, he could have stayed with Kamaswami, made money, wasted money, filled his stomach, and let his soul die of thirst; for much longer he could have lived in this soft, well upholstered hell, if this had not happened: the moment of complete hopelessness and despair, that most extreme moment, when he hang over the rushing waters and was ready to destroy himself.

No, something else from within him had died, something which already for a long time had yearned to die. Was it not this what he used to intend to kill in his ardent years as a penitent? Was this not his self, his small, frightened, and proud self, he had wrestled with for so many years, which had defeated him again and again, which was back again after every killing, prohibited joy, felt fear?

Too much knowledge had held him back, too many holy verses, too many sacrificial rules, to much self-castigation, so much doing and striving for that goal! Full of arrogance, he had been, always the smartest, always working the most, always one step ahead of all others, always the knowing and spiritual one, always the priest or wise one. Into being a priest, into this arrogance, into this spirituality, his self had retreated, there it sat firmly and grew, while he thought he would kill it by fasting and penance. Now he saw it and saw that the secret voice had been right, that no teacher would ever have been able to bring about his salvation. Therefore, he had to go out into the world, lose himself to lust and power, to woman and money, had to become a merchant, a dice-gambler, a drinker, and a greedy person, until the priest and Samana in him was dead. Therefore, he had to continue bearing these ugly years, bearing the disgust, the teachings, the pointlessness of a dreary and wasted life up to the end, up to bitter despair, until Siddhartha the lustful, Siddhartha the greedy could also die. He had died, a new Siddhartha had woken up from the sleep. He would also grow old, he would also eventually have to die, mortal was Siddhartha, mortal was every physical form.
