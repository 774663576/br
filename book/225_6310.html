In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven --!</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing "the House," you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其结果便是台尔森银行的不方便反倒是它一种完美的成就。它的大门白痴式地顽固，在被你硬推开时，它的喉咙会发出一声微弱的咕哝，让你一个趔趄直落两步台阶掉进银行，等到你定过神来，就已进入了一个可怜的店堂。那儿有两个小柜台，柜台边衰老不堪的办事员在最阴暗的窗户前核对签字时，会弄得你的支票簌簌发抖，仿佛有风在吹着。那窗户永远有从舰队街上飞来的泥水为它洗淋浴，又因它自己的铁栅栏和法学会的重重蔽障而更加阴暗。如果你因业务需要必须会见“银行当局”，你便会被送进后面一个像“死囚牢”的地方，让你在那儿因误入歧途而悔恨沉思，直到“当局”双手抄在口袋里踱了进来，而在那吓人的幽暗里你连惊异得眨眨眼也难于办到。你的钱是从虫蛀的木质抽屉里取出来的，也是送到那儿去的。开抽屉关抽屉时木料的粉末就飞进你的鼻子，钻进你的喉咙。你的钞票带着霉臭味，好像很快就要分解成碎纸。你的金银器具被塞进一个藏垢纳污之地，一两天之内它们的光泽就被周围的环境腐蚀掉。你的文件被塞进临时凑合使用的保险库里，那是用厨房的洗碗槽改装的。羊皮纸里的脂肪全被榨了出来，混进银行的空气里。你装有家庭文件的较轻的箱子则被送到楼上一间巴米赛德型的大厅里，那里永远有一张巨大的餐桌，却从来没摆过筵席。在那儿，即使到了一千七百八十年，你的情人给你写的初恋的情书和你的幼年的孩子给你写的最初的信件刚才免于受到一排首级窥看的恐怖不久。那一排首级挂在法学会大门口示众。这种做法之麻木、野蛮和凶狠可以跟阿比西尼亚和阿善提媲美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's. Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's? Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention -- it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse -- but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是事实上死刑在各行各业都是一种时髦的窍门。台尔森银行自然不甘落后。死亡既是大自然解决一切问题的良方，为什么不可以在立法上采用？因此伪造文件者处死；使用伪币者处死；私拆信件者处死；盗窃四先令六便士者处死；在台尔森银行门前为人管马却偷了马跑掉者处死；伪造先令者处死。“犯罪”这个乐器的全部音阶，有四分之三的音符谁若是触响了都会被处死。这样做对于预防犯罪并非全无好处——几乎值得一提的倒是：事实恰好相反——可它却砍掉了每一桩具体案件带给这世界的麻烦，抹掉了许多拖泥带水的事情。这祥，台尔森银行便在它存在的日子里，跟它同时代的更大的企业一祥夺去了许多人的性命。若是在它前面落地的人头不是悄悄地处理掉，而是排在法学院大门口，它们便可能在相当程度上遮去了银行底层原已不多的光线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.</div>

He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son, extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys. The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street.</div>
