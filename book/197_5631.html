<div class="line_en">On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry's favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny's trunk to the car.</div>

<div class="line_en">The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry's liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life.

<div class="line_en">Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonder when he'd see it again when they were back George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she'd left her diary. By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯莱先生发动引擎，汽车开出了院子。哈利回头看了这所房子最后一眼。他还没来得及想什么时候才能再见到它，他们又回来了：乔治把他的费力拔烟火忘在家里了。五分钟之后，汽车又在院子里刹住了，好让弗雷德跑回去拿他的飞天扫帚。快上高速公路时，金妮又尖叫起来，说她忘带日记本了。等她爬进汽车时，时间已经很晚，人们的火气也已经很旺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry couldn't see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.</div>

She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. "I mean, you'd never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry made sure that Hedwig's cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident; this wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder.

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利看了看海德薇的笼子是否在箱子顶上插牢了，然后把小行李车转过来对着隔墙。他非常自信，这远不像用飞路粉那样难受。他们俩猫起腰，坚定地推着车子朝隔墙走去，逐渐加快步伐。离墙还有几英尺时，他们跑了起来——两辆车撞在隔墙上弹了回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch.
