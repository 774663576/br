<div class="line_cn" title="“越来越有把握，我的朋友。但想要瞒过赫尔克里·波洛可没那么容易，我自有办法查清一切。”他边说边走下通往荷兰式花园的台阶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Une belle proprietor he said at last appreciatively. "Who inherits it?" His words gave me almost a shock. It is an odd thing, but until that moment the question of inheritance had never come into my head. Poirot watched me keenly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"England is very beautiful," said Poirot, his eyes straying over the prospect. Then he smiled. "And so are English girls," he said in a lower voice. "Hush, my friend, and look at the pretty picture below us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“英国的风光真美，”波洛边欣赏眼前景致，边笑着说，“英国的姑娘也非常美。”他压低了嗓门，“别出声，我的朋友，瞧瞧下面那幅美景。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I followed him. He led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew hedges. A walk led down the middle, bordered each side with formal flower beds, and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and a pond of goldfish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我紧跟上来。他领着我拐进左侧一条夹在紫杉树篱之间的小径，两侧是井井有条的花圃，小径的尽头有块半圆形的地方，地面铺得十分平整，设有坐椅，还有一眼金鱼池。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead of pursuing the path to the end, Poirot took another which wound up the side of a wooded slope. In one spot the trees had been cleared away, and a seat had been put. Sitting there one had a splendid view over the countryside, and one looked right down on the paved recess and the goldfish pond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波洛并未上前，而是沿着侧面绿树掩映的小山坡绕上去。坡上有块空地，树木已被砍掉，摆了一张长椅，端坐在这里便可饱览乡野风光，金鱼池正在下方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was then that I saw Flora. She was moving along the path we had just left and she was humming a little snatch of song. Her step was more dancing than walking, and, in spite of her black dress, there was nothing but joy in her whole attitude. She gave a sudden pirouette on her toes, and her black draperies swung out. At the same time she flung her head back and laughed outright.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我这才发现了弗洛拉。她正沿刚才我们经过的小径款款而来，一边还哼着歌。她蹦蹦跳跳的步伐与其说是走路，不如说是翩然起舞；虽然一身黑色长裙，浑身上下却充满喜悦欢欣。她踮起脚轻快地一旋，乌黑的裙角顿时扬起；与此同时她一扭头，发出银铃般的笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Blunt said nothing for a minute or two. Then he looked away from Flora into the middle distance and observed to an adjacent tree trunk that it was about time he got back to Africa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰特一时语塞，目光从弗洛拉身上游移开去，对着邻近的一棵树叨念着“也该是时候回非洲去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Anyone would think you were creaking at the joints to hear you talk," cried Flora, half vexed, half amused.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有这个打算。通常，嗯——我是说通常都是去打猎。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Blunt nodded. Then he jerked out, going rather red as he did so: "Care for some decent skins any time? If so, I could get 'em for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰特点点头，脱口而出：“你喜欢漂亮的兽皮吗？如果你喜欢，我可以带几张回来。”他的脸涨得通红。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shan't forget," said Hector Blunt.</div>

<div class="line_en">He spoke deliberately but quite simply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明知故问，倒也直接。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a moment's silence. They sat down on the stone seat by the goldfish pond. It seemed as though neither degf them knew quite what to say next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="片刻的静默后，二人在金鱼池畔的石凳上坐了下来。似乎都拿不准接下来该说什么好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her voice had lowered itself, and I saw Blunt turn and look at her, bringing his eyes back from (apparently) the coast of Africa to do so. He evidently put his own construction on her change of tone, for he said, after a minute or two, in rather an abrupt manner: "I say, you know, you mustn't worry. About that young chap, I mean. Inspector's an ass. Everybody knows utterly absurd to think he could have done it. Man from outside. Burglar chap. That's the only possible solution."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的话音渐渐低落，布兰特扭头望着她，仿佛把目光从大概是遥远的非洲海岸那里收了回来。他显然自以为了解她语气突转的原因，很快就冒冒失失地开口：“嗨，我说，你也没必要担心。我是说没必要为那个小伙子担心。警督是个饭桶，人人都知道——居然认为拉尔夫是凶手，荒谬。凶手肯定是外人。小偷。这是唯一可能的答案。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我——哦，当然，我也这么想。”又一阵沉默，然后弗洛拉突然没头没脑地说：“我⋯⋯我想告诉你今早我这么开心的原因。不管你觉得我多么无情，我都非说出来不可。因为我们家的律师——哈蒙德先生——通知了我遗嘱的内容。罗杰伯父留给我两万英镑。想想看——那可是两万英镑呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>
