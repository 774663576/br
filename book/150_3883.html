<div class="line_en">The verandah was in shadow; and lazily, her heart at ease with satisfied love, she lingered. Their house stood in the Happy Valley, on the side of the hill, for they could not afford to live on the more eligible but expensive Peak. But her abstracted gaze scarcely noticed the blue sea and the crowded shipping in the harbour. She could think only of her lover.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course it was stupid to behave as they had done that afternoon, but if he wanted her how could she be prudent? He had come two or three times after tiffin, when in the heat of the day no one thought of stirring out, and not even the boys had seen him come and go. It was very difficult at Hong Kong. She hated the Chinese city and it made her nervous to go into the filthy little house off the Victoria Road in which they were in the habit of meeting. It was a curio dealer's; and the Chinese who were sitting about stared at her unpleasantly; she hated the ingratiating smile of the old man who took her to the back of the shop and then up a dark flight of stairs. The room into which he led her was frowsy and the large wooden bed against the wall made her shudder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个下午他们的确做了蠢事，然而要是他想要她那样，她哪里还顾得来谨慎小心？他已经来她这里两三次了，都是在午饭以后，这个时候谁都懒得在太阳底下走动，即便那群童仆也没发现他来过。在香港他们的交往总是这样难。她不喜欢这座中国城市，每当她来到维多利亚路旁他们常见面的肮脏的小房子时，她就抑制不住地紧张。那是一家古玩店，店里四处落座的中国人令人厌恶地死盯着她瞧；她讨厌那个老头子，他堆了一脸讨好的笑，每次都把她带到古玩店的后边，再一溜烟跑上昏暗的楼梯给她开门。那个房间又脏又乱，墙边的大木头床简直叫她不寒而栗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went out on to the verandah and watched him leave the house. He waved his hand to her. It gave her a little thrill as she looked at him; he was forty-one, but he had the lithe figure and the springing step of a boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她跟着他来到走廊，一直看着他走出房子。他朝她挥了挥手，这不禁让她一阵激动。他已经四十一岁了，然而身体依然十分柔韧，脚步灵活得还像个小伙子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, how hateful it was that she wasn't free, that they both weren't free! She didn't like his wife. Kitty's wandering thoughts dwelt now for a moment on Dorothy Townsend. How unfortunate to be called Dorothy! It dated you. She was thirty-eight at least. But Charlie never spoke of her. Of course he didn't care for her; she bored him to death. But he was a gentleman. Kitty smiled with affectionate irony: it was just like him, silly old thing; he might be unfaithful to her, but he would never allow a word in disparagement of her to cross his lips. She was a tallish woman, taller than Kitty, neither stout nor thin, with a good deal of pale brown hair; she could never have been pretty with anything but the prettiness of youth; her features were good enough without being remarkable and her blue eyes were cold. She had a skin that you would never look at twice and no colour in her cheeks. And she dressed like -- well, like what she was, the wife of the Assistant Colonial Secretary at Hong Kong. Kitty smiled and gave her shoulders a faint shrug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唉，她一点也不自由，他也一样，这是多么让人懊恼的一件事。她不喜欢他的妻子。凯蒂的思绪有一会儿落到了多萝西·唐生的身上。叫多萝西这么个名字是多么不幸！从这个名字就可以猜出人有多大的年龄。她至少三十八岁了。但是查理从不提她。他当然一点也不把她放在心上，她无聊、烦人，他跑还来不及呢。可他是位绅士。讽刺而又带有爱意的微笑浮上凯蒂的面容：这就是他，一个保守到家的傻瓜——做出了对多萝西不忠的事，却不会在嘴上提一个字来让她失望。多萝西是位个子较高的女人，比凯蒂高一些，既不胖也不瘦，长了一头毫无光泽可言的褐色头发。除了她还是个年轻女子时那点人人都有的可爱之处外，她恐怕从来不会和“可爱”这个词沾边。她五官周正，但绝非漂亮。她有一双蓝色的眼睛，但是目光冷淡。她的皮肤你看过一眼绝无兴趣再看，面颊上毫无光彩。还有她的穿着——嗯，倒是和她的身份没有不符之处——香港助理布政司的妻子。凯蒂微笑起来，连双肩也微微地耸了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course no one could deny that Dorothy Townsend had a pleasant voice. She was a wonderful mother, Charlie always said that of her, and she was what Kitty's mother called a gentlewoman. But Kitty did not like her. She did not like her casual manner; and the politeness with which she treated you when you went there, to tea or dinner, was exasperating because you could not but feel how little interest she took in you. The fact was, Kitty supposed, that she cared for nothing but her children: there were two boys at school in England, and another boy of six whom she was going to take home next year. Her face was a mask. She smiled and in her pleasant, well- mannered way said the things that were expected of her; but for all her cordiality held you at a distance. She had a few intimate friends in the Colony and they greatly admired her. Kitty wondered whether Mrs. Townsend thought her a little common. She flushed. After all there was no reason for her to put on airs. It was true that her father had been a Colonial Governor and of course it was very grand while it lasted -- every one stood up when you entered a room and men took off their hats to you as you passed in your car -- but what could be more insignificant than a Colonial Governor when he had retired? Dorothy Townsend's father lived on a pension in a small house at Earl's Court. Kitty's mother would think it a dreadful bore if she asked her to call.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然谁也不能否认多萝西·唐生有一副听起来让人舒服的嗓音。她还是位好母亲，查理常常把这一点挂在嘴边，而且她是那种凯蒂的妈妈称之为淑女的女人。然而凯蒂不喜欢她。她不喜欢她心不在焉的仪态。要是她请你喝杯茶或吃顿晚餐，她的礼仪会讲究到夸张的地步，让你觉得她当你根本就是个外人。凯蒂觉得她唯一在乎的就是她的孩子：她有两个儿子尚在英格兰上学，另外还有一个六岁的儿子，她明年就想把他带回英国去。她的脸实在只是一张面具。她对人微笑，谈吐优雅，符合她的身份，但却给人一种拒人于千里之外的感觉。在这块殖民地上她有一群闺中密友，而她们对她无疑全都崇敬有加。凯蒂怀疑唐生夫人是否会认为自己的出身过于平凡。她不禁脸红起来。不过平凡的出身倒使凯蒂不必处处装腔作势。不可否认，多萝西的父亲一度官至殖民地总督，在位期间自然风光无限——他初入房间时人人都起立致敬，乘车离去时男士们无不脱帽致意——然而还有什么比一位退了休的殖民地总督更无足轻重的呢？多萝西·唐生的父亲现在栖身于伯爵府上的小房子里，靠养老金怏怏度日。凯蒂的母亲绝不会要求女儿来探望她一下，跟女儿在一起对她来说无聊透顶。">查看中文翻译</div>
