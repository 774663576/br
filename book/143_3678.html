<div class="line_en">Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta, with the lightest of hearts, were in the process of breaking these laws. It was Pisciotta who had all the black market contacts and who had arranged this affair. He had contracted with a farmer to smuggle a great wheel of cheese from the countryside to a black market dealer in Montelepre. Their pay for this would be four smoked hams and a basket of sausage which would make his sister's engagement party a great celebration. They were breaking two laws, one forbidding dealing in the black market, the other smuggling from one province of Italy to another. There was not much the authorities could do to enforce the black market laws; they would have had to jail everyone in Sicily. But smuggling was another matter. Patrols of National Police, the carabinieri, roamed the countryside, set up roadblocks, paid informers. They could not of course interfere with the caravans of Don Croce Malo who used American Army trucks and special military government passes. But they could net many of the small farmers and starving villagers.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Sicily this September of 1943, people could only exist by trading in the black market. Strict rationing of foodstuffs still carried over from the war, and farmers had to turn in their produce to central government storehouses at fixed prices and for paper money that was almost worthless. In turn the government was supposed to sell and distribute these foodstuffs at low prices to the people. Under this system everybody would get enough to remain alive. In reality, the farmers hid what they could because what they turned in to the government storehouses was appropriated by Don Croce Malo and his mayors to be sold on the black market. The people themselves then had to buy on the black market and break smuggling laws merely to exist. If they were caught doing this they were prosecuted and sent to jail. What good was it that a democratic government had been established in Rome? They would be able to vote as they starved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1943年9月的西西里，人们只能靠到黑市上进行交易才能生活下去。战时严格的食品配给仍在实行，农民必须把自己的农产品按定价卖给中央政府的粮仓，换取几乎一文不值的纸币。政府本应把这些粮食低价卖给或分配给民众。有了这样的制度，每个人都应当得到足够的粮食来生存。事实上，农民尽量多地私藏粮食，因为他们上交给政府仓库的东西，都被唐·克罗切·马洛和他支持的镇长拿到黑市上加价出售了。民众不得不到黑市上去买，他们是为求生存才违法进行走私的。如果他们被抓住，就会受到指控并被投入监狱。罗马的民主政府对他们有什么好处呢？他们可以去投票，但他们还得忍饥挨饿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they set out for the long journey home, Guiliano sent Pisciotta ahead to scout for the carabinieri. They had arranged a set of whistling signals to warn of danger. The donkey carried the cheeses easily and behaved amiably -- he had had his reward before setting out. They journeyed for two hours, slowly ascending, before there was any sign of danger. Then Guiliano saw behind them, perhaps three miles away, following their path, a caravan of six mules and a man on horseback. If the path was known to others in the black market, it could have been marked by the field police for a roadblock. As a caution, he sent Pisciotta scouting far ahead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="返程的路还很长。出发前，吉里安诺让皮肖塔在前面侦察宪兵。他们用特定的口哨声作为通报危险的暗号。驴子驮着奶酪走得轻松自如，也很听话，狂欢节的典礼上它已经得到了奖赏。他们慢慢地往山上走，一路上没有发现任何危险迹象。两小时后，吉里安诺发现身后大约三英里处有个商队在跟着他们，有六只骡子和一个骑马的人。如果黑市上还有别人知道这条路，那么在外巡逻的警察就可能在这里设卡。为小心起见，他让皮肖塔走得更远一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took them four hours to get to the farm. Guiliano and Pisciotta picked up the huge grainy white cheese and the other goods and strapped them onto the donkey. They formed a camouflage of sisal grass and bamboo stalks over the goods so that it would appear they were merely bringing in fodder for the livestock kept in the households of many villagers. They had the carelessness and confidence of youth, of children really, who hide treasures from their parents, as if the intention to deceive were enough. Their confidence came too from the knowledge that they could find hidden paths through the mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺和皮肖塔走了四个小时才到那个农庄。他们把那块巨大的白色奶酪和其他东西绑在驴子身上，然后在上面覆盖了一些麻秆和竹子作掩护，这样看起来他们就像是给牲口送饲料的，因为许多村民的家里都养了牲口。他们像许多年轻人一样既自信又粗心，或者说更像那些想瞒过父母，把自己心爱的东西藏起来的小孩子。他们之所以信心十足，是因为他们熟悉山间的秘密通道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After an hour he caught up with Aspanu, who was sitting on a huge stone smoking a cigarette and coughing. Aspanu looked pale; he should not have been smoking. Turi Guiliano sat down beside him to rest. One of their strongest bonds since childhood was that they never tried to command each other in any way, so Turi said nothing. Finally Aspanu stubbed out the cigarette and put the blackened butt into his pocket. They started walking again, Guiliano holding the donkey's bridle, Aspanu walking behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一小时，他追上了阿斯帕努，见他正坐在大石头上边抽烟边咳嗽。此时阿斯帕努脸色苍白，其实他是不该抽烟的。图里·吉里安诺在他身边坐下歇一歇。他什么也没说，因为他们之间谁也不想对对方指手画脚，这是他们从小就形成的主要默契之一。最后，阿斯帕努掐灭了手里的香烟，把烧黑的烟头放进口袋。他们又开始赶路。吉里安诺在前面牵着驴缰，阿斯帕努走在后边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were traveling a mountain path that bypassed the roads and little villages but sometimes they saw an ancient Greek water cistern that spouted water through a crumpled statue's mouth, or the remains of a Norman castle that many centuries ago had barred this way to invaders. Again Turi Guiliano dreamed of Sicily's past and his future. He thought of his godfather, Hector Adonis, who had promised to come after the Festa and prepare his application to the University of Palermo. And when he thought of his godfather he felt momentary sadness. Hector Adonis never came to the Festas; the drunken men would make fun of his short stature, the children, some of them taller than he, would offer him some insult. Turi wondered about God stunting the growth of a man's body and bursting his brain with knowledge. For Turi thought Hector Adonis the most brilliant man in the world and loved him for the kindness he had showed him and his parents.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly they were passing through a stand of trees, a small forest, one of the few left in this part of Sicily, which now seemed to grow only the great white stones and marble quarries. On the other side of the mountain they would begin the descent into Montelepre and would have to be careful of the roving patrols of National Police, the carabinieri. But now they were coming to the Quattro Moline, the Four Crossroads, and it would pay to be a little careful here too. Guiliano pulled on the donkey's bridle and motioned Aspanu to halt. They stood there quietly. No strange sound could be heard, only the steady hum of the countless insects that swarmed over the ground, their whirring wings and legs buzzing like a far distant saw. They moved forward over the crossroads and then safely out of sight into another small forest. Turi Guiliano started to daydream again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然他们面前出现了一片小树林，是西西里仅存的少数林地之一，现在这一带似乎到处都是巨大的白色岩石和大理石采石场。翻越这个山头之后，一路向下就到蒙特莱普雷了。他们必须倍加小心，提防宪兵的流动巡逻队，不过眼前这个“四岔路口”也不能掉以轻心。吉里安诺拉住驴缰，并示意阿斯帕努停下。他们悄然站在那里，没有听见异常的响动，只听见无数贴近地面飞舞的昆虫发出的嗡嗡声。这是它们振动翅膀和腿所发出的声音，就像远处传来的锯木声。他们穿过这个路口，安然进入另一片小树林。图里·吉里安诺又开始了遐想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought of his father working so hard on their small piece of land, and of his sisters with their threadbare clothes. It was lucky that Mariannina was so beautiful that she had caught a husband despite her poverty and the unsettled times. But most of all he anguished over his mother, Maria Lombardo. Even as a child he had recognized her bitterness, her unhappiness. She had tasted the rich fruits of America and could no longer be happy in the poverty-stricken towns of Sicily. His father would tell the tales of those glorious days and his mother would burst into tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想到在自家那一小块土地上辛勤劳作的父亲，想到两个衣衫破烂的姐姐。所幸的是，玛丽安尼娜长得漂亮，尽管家境贫寒，时局很乱，她却找了个丈夫。不过他觉得最可怜的还是他母亲玛丽亚·隆巴尔多。他在小时候就意识到母亲活得很痛苦，很不开心。她感受过美国的富饶，在西西里这样一个贫困的小镇上，她怎么也高兴不起来。他父亲经常讲述那些美好的时光，他母亲听了就会潸然泪下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The trees widened out suddenly, as if they had been pushed back, and they were picking their way across a small clearing with a rough floor of tiny stones, cropped bamboo stalks, thin balding grass. The late afternoon sun was falling far away from them and looked pale and cold above the granite-studded mountains. Past this clearing the path would begin to drop in a long winding spiral to the town of Montelepre. Suddenly Guiliano came out of his dreams. A flash of light like the striking of a match lanced his left eye. He jerked the donkey to a halt and held up his hand to Aspanu.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="转眼间，前面的林木稀疏起来，好像被人推向了远处似的。他们路过一小块开阔地，地面高低不平，全是碎石子、砍伐留下的竹桩，和一些稀稀拉拉、几乎没有叶子的小草。在花岗岩密布的山峦上方，傍晚的太阳苍白惨淡，正渐渐离他们远去。过了这片开阔地，就是一条迤逦的小路，向下一直通到远处的蒙特莱普雷。突然吉里安诺的左眼感觉到一丝闪光，就像有人划了一根火柴，他猛然从白日梦中惊醒，一把拉住驴子，并示意阿斯帕努停下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only thirty yards away, strange men stepped out from behind a thicket. There were three of them, and Turi Guiliano saw their stiff black military caps, the black uniforms with white piping. He felt a sick foolish feeling of despair, of shame, that he had been caught. The three men fanned out as they advanced, weapons at the ready. Two were quite young with ruddy shining faces and crusted military caps tilted almost comically to the backs of their heads. They seemed earnest yet gleeful as they pointed their machine pistols.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从三十码开外的灌木丛中走出三个陌生人。图里·吉里安诺看见了他们的黑色军帽和镶白边的黑色军服。他觉得自己真笨，绝望与羞愧的感觉油然而生：他们被抓住了。三个人端着枪走向他们，行进过程中逐渐散开。其中两个人很年轻，脸红扑扑的，硬边军帽歪戴在后脑勺上，样子很滑稽。他们把冲锋手枪的枪口对着这一边，神情认真，还有点沾沾自喜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The carabiniere in the center was older and held a rifle. His face was pockmarked and scarred and his cap was pulled firmly over his eyes. He had sergeant's stripes on his sleeve. The flash of light Guiliano had seen was a sunbeam drawn by the steel rifle barrel. This man was smiling grimly, his rifle pointed unwaveringly at Guiliano's chest. Guiliano's despair turned to anger at that smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中间的那个宪兵年纪大些，手里拿着步枪。他的脸上坑坑洼洼，还有几道伤疤。他的帽檐一直拉到了眼睛上方，袖子上戴的是士官臂章。吉里安诺刚才看到的闪光就是从这支步枪枪管反射的阳光。那士官用枪口对着吉里安诺的胸膛，脸上露出狰狞的笑。吉里安诺看见这狞笑后，立刻由绝望变成了愤怒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Sergeant with the rifle stepped closer, his two fellow guards closing in from either side. Now Turi Guiliano was alert. The two young carabinieri with their machine pistols were not so much to be feared; they were carelessly approaching the donkey, not taking their prisoners seriously. They motioned Guiliano and Pisciotta away from the donkey and one of them let his pistol sway back on its sling as he stripped the camouflage bamboo from the donkey's back. When he saw the goods he let out a whistle of greedy delight. He didn't notice Aspanu edging closer to him but the Sergeant with the rifle did. He shouted, "You, with the mustache, move away," and Aspanu stepped back closer to Turi Guiliano.</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment there was the braying of mules and the clatter of hooves from behind and bursting into the clearing came the caravan of mules that Guiliano had spotted on the road behind him that afternoon. The man on horseback leading it carried a lupara slung over his shoulder and looked huge in a heavy leather jacket. He jumped down off his horse and took a great wad of lire notes from one of his pockets and said to the carabiniere with the rifle, "So, you've scooped up a few little sardines this time." They obviously knew each other. For the first time the rifleman relaxed his vigilance to accept the money offered to him. The two men were grinning at each other. The prisoners seemed to have been forgotten by everyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时候，后面传来了骡叫声和急促的骡蹄声，下午跟在他们后面的那个商队此刻也进了这片开阔地。骑在马上的那个领队肩上挎着一支短筒猎枪，穿了一件厚实的皮夹克，看上去体型庞大。他从马上跳下来，从口袋里掏出一大沓里拉，对手持步枪的宪兵说：“看来这一次你逮住了几条小沙丁鱼。”显然他们相互认识。这个手持步枪的人第一次放松了警惕，欣然接受了送给他的钱。两人相视一笑，似乎全然忘记了这两个被逮住的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bastinado was a term loosely used for a physical beating with whips and clubs. Guiliano knew some citizens of Montelepre who had been punished in the Bellampo Barracks. They had returned to their homes with broken knees, heads swollen as big as melons, their insides injured so that they could never work again. The carabinieri would never do that to him. Guiliano went to one knee as if he were going to lie down, put one hand on the ground and the other on his belt so that he could draw the pistol from beneath his shirt. The clearing was now bathed with the soft hazy light of beginning twilight, the sun far over the trees had dipped below the last mountain. He saw Pisciotta standing proudly, refusing the command. Surely they would not shoot him down over a piece of smuggled cheese. He could see the pistols trembling in the hands of the young guards.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he had been right about the rifleman being the most dangerous. The Sergeant dropped the wad of money to the ground, swung his rifle up and very coolly shot. There was no mistaking the hit; Guiliano's body dropped like a dead bird.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的判断没错，那个手持步枪的士官最危险，只见他把手中那一沓钱扔在地上，掉转枪口，非常冷静地开始射击。他无疑击中了目标，吉里安诺的身体像一只死鸟似的落在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turi Guiliano moved slowly toward the nearest guard. Pisciotta was edging toward the nearest bamboo thicket. The guards didn't notice. Guiliano hit the nearest guard with his forearm, knocking him to the ground. He shouted to Pisciotta, "Run." Pisciotta dove into the bamboo thicket and Guiliano ran to the trees. The remaining guard was too stunned or too inept to bring his pistol around in time. Guiliano, about to plunge into the shelter of the forest, felt a quick sense of exultation. He launched his body into midair to dive between two sturdy trees that would shield him. As he did so he drew the pistol free from beneath his shirt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano heard the shot at the same time he felt his body wracked with pain, as if he had been hit with a giant club. He landed on the ground between the two trees and tried to get up, but could not. His legs were numb; he could not make them move. Pistol in hand he twisted his body and saw the Sergeant shake his rifle in the air in triumph. And then Guiliano felt his trousers filling with blood, the liquid warm and sticky.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the fraction of a second before he pulled the trigger of his pistol, Turi Guiliano felt only astonishment. That they had shot him over a piece of cheese. That they had smashed the fabric of his family with such a cruel carelessness just because he was running away from such a small breaking of the law that everyone broke. His mother would weep to the end of her days. And now his body was awash in blood, he who had never done anyone any harm.</div>

<div class="line_en">He pulled the trigger and saw the rifle fall, saw the Sergeant's black cap with its white piping seem to fly in the air as the body with its mortal head wound crumpled and floated to the rock-filled earth.

<div class="line_en">Turi Guiliano rolled into the bushes. He had seen the enemy's face shatter into a mask of blood and that gave him hope. He was not powerless. He tried to get up again and this time his legs obeyed him. He began to run but only one leg sprang forward, the other dragged along the ground, which surprised him. His crotch was warm and sticky, his trousers soaked, his vision cloudy. When he ran through a sudden patch of light, he was afraid he had circled back into the clearing again and tried to turn back. His body started to fall -- not to the ground, but into an endless red-tinted black void, and then he knew he was falling forever.</div>

For that insult they made him load the Sergeant's body onto his horse and made him walk back to their barracks. Before that they relieved him of his weapon.

There was a ferocity in his soul that banished all fear of death, and when he heard the smuggler offer to bring back Turi's carcass, he burned that man's face forever in his brain.

<div class="line_en">He knelt and took the pistol and thrust it into his belt. At that moment Turi Guiliano's eyes opened. The eyes were alive with an awesome hatred, but they were staring past Aspanu Pisciotta. Pisciotta almost wept with relief and tried to get him to his feet, but he was not strong enough. "Turi, try to get up, I'll help you," Pisciotta said. Guiliano pushed his hands against the earth and raised his body. Pisciotta put an arm around his waist and his hand became warm and wet. He jerked his hand away and pulled aside Guiliano's shirt, and with horror he saw the huge gaping hole in Guiliano's side. He propped Guiliano up against a tree, ripped off his own shirt and shoved it into the hole to staunch the blood, tying the sleeves together around the waist. He put one arm around his friend's middle and then with his free hand took Guiliano's left hand and raised it high in the air. This balanced them both as he guided Guiliano down the path with careful, mincing steps. From a distance it looked as if they were dancing together down the mountain.</div>
