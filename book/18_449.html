Also, they refuse to play the songs I have written for them. All the songs I have written for the mice to play go oompah oompah. But the white mice will only play toodle oodle, like that.

Miss Spink and Miss Forcible made a point of telling Coraline how dangerous the well was, on the first day Coraline's family moved in, and warned her to be sure she kept away from it.

<div class="line_en">She found it on the third day, in an overgrown meadow beside the tennis court, behind a clump of trees -- a low brick circle almost hidden in the high grass. The well had been covered up by wooden boards, to stop anyone falling in. There was a small knot-hole in one of the boards, and Coraline spent an afternoon dropping pebbles and acorns through the hole, and waiting, and counting, until she heard the plop as they hit the water, far below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到第三天，卡萝兰才发现了那口井。在网球场后的一片蒿草丛里，被一簇树档着。一圈儿砖砌的井栏，都快被草丛遮没了。井口盖着几块木板，免得有谁掉下去。其中一块木板上本来有个节疤，节疤脱落以后成了一个小窟窿。卡萝兰花了一个下午的时间往窟窿里扔石子儿、橡子。扔进去一颗，等着，心里数着数，半天才能听见落进水里的噗通一声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Coraline had watched all the videos. She was bored with her toys, and she'd read all her books. She turned on the television. She went from channel to channel to channel, but there was nothing on but men in suits talking about the stock market, and schools programmes. Eventually, she found something to watch: it was the last half of a natural history programme about something called protective coloration. She watched animals, birds and insects which disguised themselves as leaves or twigs or other animals to escape from things that could hurt them. She enjoyed it, but it ended too soon, and was followed by a programme about a cake factory.</div>
