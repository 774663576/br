<div class="line_en">Vaguely she knew that terrible things were happening there, not from Walter who when she questioned him (for otherwise he rarely spoke to her) answered with a humorous nonchalance which sent a shiver down her spine; but from Waddington and from the amah. The people were dying at the rate of a hundred a day, and hardly any of those who were attacked by the disease recovered from it; the gods had been brought out from the abandoned temples and placed in the streets; offerings were laid before them and sacrifices made, but they did not stay the plague. The people died so fast that it was hardly possible to bury them. In some houses the whole family had been swept away and there was none to perform the funeral rites. The officer commanding the troops was a masterful man and if the city was not given over to riot and arson it was due to his determination. He forced his soldiers to bury such as there was no one else to bury and he had shot with his own hand an officer who demurred at entering a stricken house.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since Walter went out early in the morning, came back at tiffin only for half an hour, and did not then return till dinner was just ready, Kitty found herself much alone. For some days she did not stir from the bungalow. It was very hot and for the most part she lay in a long chair by the open window, trying to read. The hard light of mid-day had robbed the magic palace of its mystery and now it was no more than a temple on the city wall, garish and shabby, but because she had seen it once in such an ecstasy it was never again quite commonplace; and often at dawn or at dusk, and again at night, she found herself able to recapture something of that beauty. What had seemed to her a mighty bastion was but the city wall and on this, massive and dark, her eyes rested continually. Behind its crenellations lay the city in the dread grip of the pestilence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦尔特一大早就出门，只在午饭的时候回来待那么半个钟头，然后直到晚餐准备好才能见到他的影儿。凯蒂大部分时间是一个人待着，有好几天她都没出过平房。天气热极了，她敞开窗户，捧上一本书躺到长椅上，借此打发时光。那座暴露在正午炽热阳光下的宫殿，神奇色彩早已荡然无存。它只不过是城墙上的一座庙宇，装饰浮华而俗气，不过毕竟它曾呈现一派美妙的幻象，因而在她眼里还是有些与众不同。到了拂晓、黄昏以至夜晚，她偶尔会幸运地捕捉到它独一无二的美感。而雄伟的城堡其实也只是城墙的一部分而已，她的眼睛时常呆呆地望着那高大灰暗的墙壁，思忖着垛口的后面就是那座被致命的瘟疫所侵袭的城市。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was out of the question. If she went, where could she go? Not to her mother; her mother would make her see very plainly that, having married her off, she counted on being rid of her; and besides she did not want to go to her mother. She wanted to go to Charlie, and he did not want her. She knew what he would say if she suddenly appeared before him. She saw the sullen look on his face and the shrewd hardness behind his charming eyes. It would be difficult for him to find words that sounded well. She clenched her hands. She would have given anything to humiliate him as he had humiliated her. Sometimes she was seized with such a frenzy that she wished she had let Walter divorce her, ruining herself if only she could have ruined him too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这是不可能的。要是她走了，有什么地方可去呢？她妈妈那里是不行的。如果她去了，妈妈的态度会显而易见地摆出来：嫁出去的姑娘，泼出去的水。另外自己也不情愿栖身到娘家那儿。她倒是想去找查理，但是恐怕他不会有好脸见她。她能猜出如果她突然出现在他眼前，他嘴里会吐出些什么话来。她都能想见他那张拉长的脸，还有那双迷人眼睛背后的精明算计。他的话不会有多好听的。她一下子攥紧了拳头，她真该以牙还牙，当初他怎么羞辱她的，就怎么都还给他。有时她会勃然大怒，恨不得瓦尔特跟她离了婚，毁了自己没有关系，只要能跟他同归于尽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Certain things he had said to her made her blush with shame when she recalled them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty sometimes was so frightened that her heart sank within her and she would tremble in every limb. It was all very well to say that the risk was small if you took reasonable precautions: she was panic-stricken. She turned over in her mind crazy plans of escape. To get away, just to get away, she was prepared to set out as she was and make her way alone, without anything but what she stood up in, to some place of safety. She thought of throwing herself on the mercy of Waddington, telling him everything and beseeching him to help her to get back to Hong Kong. If she flung herself on her knees before her husband, and admitted that she was frightened, even though he hated her now he must have enough human feeling in him to pity her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想起这些来，凯蒂有时会吓得胸口发闷、四肢颤抖。虽说只要预防得好就不会有危险，但是说得容易，她已经快要被恐惧折磨得发疯了。她的脑子里装满了逃跑的想法。离开这儿，只要能离开这儿，哪怕不搭个伴儿就走也可以。什么也用不着带，只要把她自个儿带走，带到一个安全的地方。她想去求求韦丁顿，坦白地告诉他一切，然后哀求他把她弄到香港。她想跪到她丈夫跟前，告诉他自己已经被吓成什么样儿了。即便他曾经恨她，现在也该发发慈悲饶了她了。">查看中文翻译</div>
