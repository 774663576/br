<div class="line_en">It wasn't a perception of sight or sound, although it was very near to those things, separated from those senses by the filmiest of perceptual curtains. It was as if another Overlook now lay scant inches beyond this one, separated from the real world (if there is such a thing as a "real world," Jack thought) but gradually coming into balance with it. He was reminded of the 3-D movies he'd seen as a kid. If you looked at -- the screen without the special glasses, you saw a double image -- the sort of thing he was feeling now. But when you put the glasses on, it made sense.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could almost hear the self-important ding! ding! of the silver-plated bell on the registration desk, summoning bellboys to the front as men in the fashionable flannels of the 1920s checked in and men in fashionable 1940s double-breasted pinstripes checked out. There would be three nuns sitting in front of the fireplace as they waited for the check-out line to thin, and standing behind them, nattily dressed with diamond stickpins holding their blue-and-white-figured ties, Charles Grondin and Vito Gienelli discussed profit and loss, life and death. There were a dozen trucks in the loading bays out back, some laid one over the other like bad time exposures. In the east-wing ballroom, a dozen different business conventions were going on at the same time within temporal centimeters of each other. There was a costume ball going on. There were soirees, wedding receptions, birthday and anniversary parties. Men talking about Neville Chamberlain and the Archduke of Austria. Music. Laughter. Drunkenness. Hysteria. Little love, not here, but a steady undercurrent of sensuousness. And he could almost hear all of them together, drifting through the hotel and making a graceful cacophony. In the dining room where he stood, breakfast, lunch, and dinner for seventy years were all being served simultaneously just behind him. He could almost… no, strike the almost. He could hear them, faintly as yet, but clearly -- the way one can hear thunder miles off on a hot summer's day. He could hear all of them, the beautiful strangers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他好像能听到登记台上镀银的铃铛自以为是的“叮！叮！”声，召唤着侍应生到前台去侍候身着20年代流行的法兰绒西服的客人办理入住手续，或者侍候身着40年代时兴的双排扣细条子西服的客人结账离开。三位修女坐在壁炉前等办理结账手续的队伍变短，站在她们后面的是查尔斯·格隆丁和维多 ·吉埃内利，他们优雅地打着蓝白花纹的领带，戴着钻石领带夹，讨论着得与失、生与死。十几辆卡车停在大楼后面，其中几辆叠在另几辆上，像曝光不好的照片。东侧的舞厅里，十几个不同的商业会议正在同时举行，相互之间仅相隔人世间的几厘米。一场假面舞会正在进行中，还有社交晚会，婚礼，生日晚会，周年庆祝会。人们谈论着内维尔·张伯伦和奥地利大公。音乐，笑声，醉态，歇斯底里。没有爱，爱不在这儿，但有一股绵绵不断的肉感潜流。他几乎能够同时听到这一切，它们在饭店中流动，营造出一片雍容有度的嘈杂声。他所在的餐厅里，70年的早餐、午餐、晚餐在他背后同时供应着。他几乎…不，不是几乎，他能够听到这些声音，虽然还有些微弱，但很清晰——就像在某个炎夏的日子里能听到几英里外的雷声一样。他能听出所有的人，这些漂亮的陌生人。">查看中文翻译</div>

Low, throaty female laughter, the kind that seems to vibrate in a fairy ring around the viscera and the genitals. The sound of a cash register, its window softly lighted in the warm halfdark, ringing up the price of a gin rickey, a Manhattan, a depression bomber, a sloe gin fizz, a zombie. The jukebox, pouring out its drinkers' melodies, each one overlapping the other in time.</div>

Some of the occupants were dressed in costumes… a woman in gauzy harem pants and a rhinestone-sparkled brassiere, a man with a foxhead rising slyly out of his evening dress, a man in a silvery dog outfit who was tickling the nose of a woman in a sarong with the puff on the end of his long tail, to the general amusement of all.</div>

The juniper fumes of the gin were pleasantly maddening, but they also seemed to be blurring his reason. Danny? What was all of this about Danny?

The man beside the woman in the sarong had removed his foxhead and Jack saw that it was Horace Derwent, his pallid blond hair spilling across his forehead. Everyone at the bar was watching, too. The woman beside him was looking at him closely, as if trying to focus. Her dress had slipped off one shoulder and looking down he could see a loosely puckered nipple capping one sagging breast. Looking back at her face he began to think that this might be the woman from 217, the one who had tried to strangle Danny. On his other hand, the man in the sharp blue suit had removed a small pearl-handled.32 from his jacket pocket and was idly spinning it on the bar, like a man with Russian roulette on his mind.</div>
