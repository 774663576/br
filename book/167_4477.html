<div class="line_en">"Pinkeye never wakes." His true name was Mebble, but everyone called him Pinkeye for his runny eyes. "Not once he's passed out." Each morning he broke his fast with ale. Each evening he fell into a drunken sleep after supper, wine-colored spit running down his chin. Arya would wait until she heard him snoring, then creep barefoot up the servant's stair, making no more noise than the mouse she'd been. She carried neither candle nor taper. Syrio had told her once that darkness could be her friend, and he was right. If she had the moon and the stars to see by, that was enough. "I bet we could escape, and Pinkeye wouldn't even notice I was gone," she told Hot Pie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“粉红眼不会醒啦，”他的真名是梅布尔，但人人都叫他“粉红眼”，因为他眼睛老是黏呼呼的，“睡下去跟死猪一样。”他一早起来就拿麦酒配早餐，晚饭后便醉醺醺地睡去，连梦中流淌的唾沫都是酒的颜色。艾莉亚只需等到他打呼噜，便可赤脚悄悄爬上仆人用的楼梯，发出的声响就像老鼠。她已经成了老鼠，大小蜡烛都不用。西利欧曾告诉她，黑暗可以为友，他说得对，月光和星光便已足够。“我打赌，我们能逃跑，我跑了粉红眼也不知道，”她告诉热派。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The horn had stirred the castle from sleep; men were coming out into the ward to see what the commotion was about. Arya fell in with the others. A line of ox carts were rumbling under the portcullis. Plunder, she knew at once. The riders escorting the carts spoke in a babble of queer tongues. Their armor glinted pale in the moonlight, and she saw a pair of striped blackand-white zorses. The Bloody Mummers. Arya withdrew a little deeper into the shadows, and watched as a huge black bear rolled by, caged in the back of a wagon. Other carts were loaded down with silver plate, weapons and shields, bags of flour, pens of squealing hogs and scrawny dogs and chickens. Arya was thinking how long it had been since she'd had a slice off a pork roast when she saw the first of the prisoners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="号角将沉睡中的城堡唤醒，大家纷纷走到院子来看个究竟，艾莉亚混在人群中。一列牛车隆隆作响驶进闸门，抢来的财物，她一看就知道。护卫车队的骑手们嘀咕着怪异的语言，甲胄在月光下闪着淡淡的光，她看到两匹黑白条纹的马。是血戏班。艾莉亚往阴影里缩了缩。牛车运进一头关在笼子里的大黑熊，其他车里则载满银器、武器、盾牌、一袋袋面粉、一窝窝尖叫的猪，以及骨瘦如柴的狗和鸡。艾莉亚正计算自己有多久没吃过烤猪肉，这时俘虏们走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By his bearing and the proud way he held his head, he must have been a lord. She could see mail glinting beneath his torn red surcoat. At first Arya took him for a Lannister, but when he passed near a torch she saw his device was a silver fist, not a lion. His wrists were bound tightly, and a rope around one ankle tied him to the man behind him, and him to the man behind him, so the whole column had to shuffle along in a lurching lockstep. Many of the captives were wounded. If any halted, one of the riders would trot up and give him a lick of the whip to get him moving again. She tried to judge how many prisoners there were, but lost count before she got to fifty. There were twice that many at least. Their clothing was stained with mud and blood, and in the torchlight it was hard to make out all their badges and sigils, but some of those Arya glimpsed she recognized. Twin towers. Sunburst. Bloody man. Battle-axe. The battleaxe is for Cerwyn, and the white sun on black is Karstark. They're northmen. My father's men, and Robb's. She didn't like to think what that might mean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他高傲地昂着头，从举止和衣着看来，一定是位领主。她看到他破碎的红外衣下闪亮的锁甲，还以为是兰尼斯特家的人，但当他经过火炬旁，她发现他的纹章是银色的拳套，不是狮子。他手腕被绑得紧紧的，脚踝的绳子更将他和身后的人连在一起，绳子互相衔接：整个队列只能以一致的步伐摇晃着缓缓挪动。许多人受了伤，但只要谁停下来，骑手便会跑上来抽一鞭，驱赶他继续前进。她想数数总共有多少俘虏，但数到五十就乱了套，只知道总数至少是这个数的两倍。他们衣服上沾泥带血，映着火炬的光，令人很难分辨纹章印记，但一瞥之下，她还是认出了一部分：双塔，日芒，剥皮人，战斧…战斧是赛文家，黑底日芒是卡史塔克。他们是北方人，父亲的部下，罗柏的部下。她不愿去想这代表什么意义。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Bloody Mummers began to dismount. Stableboys emerged sleepy from their straw to tend their lathered horses. One of the riders was shouting for ale. The noise brought Ser Amory Lorch out onto the covered gallery above the ward, flanked by two torchbearers. Goat-helmed Vargo Hoat reined up below him. "My lord cathellan," the sellsword said. He had a thick, slobbery voice, as if his tongue was too big for his mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">As his men herded off the captives at spearpoint, Arya saw Pinkeye emerge from the stairwell, blinking at the torchlight. If he found her missing, he would shout and threaten to whip the bloody hide off her, but she was not afraid. He was no Weese. He was forever threatening to whip the bloody hide off this one or that one, but Arya never actually knew him to hit. Still, it would be better if he never saw her. She glanced around. The oxen were being unharnessed, the carts unloaded, while the Brave Companions clamored for drink and the curious gathered around the caged bear. In the commotion, it was not hard to slip off unseen. She went back the way she had come, wanting to be out of sight before someone noticed her and thought to put her to work.</div>

<div class="line_en">Away from the gates and the stables, the great castle was largely deserted. The noise dwindled behind her. A swirling wind gusted, drawing a high shivery scream from the cracks in the Wailing Tower. Leaves had begun to fall from the trees in the godswood, and she could hear them moving through the deserted courtyards and between the empty buildings, making a faint skittery sound as the wind drove them across the stones. Now that Harrenhal was near empty once again, sound did queer things here. Sometimes the stones seemed to drink up noise, shrouding the yards in a blanket of silence. Other times, the echoes had a life of their own, so every footfall became the tread of a ghostly army, and every distant voice a ghostly feast. The funny sounds were one of the things that bothered Hot Pie, but not Arya.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在城门和马厩之外，巨大的城堡几乎全部荒芜。吵闹逐渐减弱。旋风刮起，号哭塔的石头缝隙发出高亢悚然的尖啸。神木林已开始落叶，叶子随风飘过废弃的庭院，飘过空荡荡的建筑物，擦着石头，发出轻微的声响。如今赫伦堡再度空旷，声音由是有了诡异的效果。有时石头会吸走声音，将庭院裹进一层沉默的毯子；有时回音有自己的生命，每一次落脚都成为幽灵大军的踏步，每一回远方的话音都成为鬼魂欢宴的笑语。这些奇怪的声响困扰着热派，却不能困扰艾莉亚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quiet as a shadow, she flitted across the middle bailey, around the Tower of Dread, and through the empty mews, where people said the spirits of dead falcons stirred the air with ghostly wings. She could go where she would. The garrison numbered no more than a hundred men, so small a troop that they were lost in Harrenhal. The Hall of a Hundred Hearths was closed off, along with many of the lesser buildings, even the Wailing Tower. Ser Amory Lorch resided in the castellan's chambers in Kingspyre, themselves as spacious as a lord's, and Arya and the other servants had moved to the cellars beneath him so they would be close at hand. While Lord Tywin had been in residence, there was always a man-at-arms wanting to know your business. But now there were only a hundred men left to guard a thousand doors, and no one seemed to know who should be where, or care much.</div>

She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel music he made. He's strong, she thought.

<div class="line_en">Arya climbed. Up in the kingdom of the leaves, she unsheathed and for a time forgot them all, Ser Amory and the Mummers and her father's men alike, losing herself in the feel of rough wood beneath the soles of her feet and the swish of sword through air. A broken branch became Joffrey. She struck at it until it fell away. The queen and Ser Ilyn and Ser Meryn and the Hound were only leaves, but she killed them all as well, slashing them to wet green ribbons. When her arm grew weary, she sat with her legs over a high limb to catch her breath in the cool dark air, listening to the squeak of bats as they hunted. Through the leafy canopy she could see the bone-white branches of the heart tree. It looks just like the one in Winterfell from here. If only it had been… then when she climbed down she would have been home again, and maybe find her father sitting under the weirwood where he always sat.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“Valar morghulis，”她跟着念，然后穿贾昆衣服的陌生人朝她鞠了一躬，转身退进黑暗，斗篷飘荡。艾莉亚独自一人留在死尸旁。他们该死，她告诉自己，想起亚摩利·洛奇爵士在湖边庄园的屠杀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Come dawn, Pinkeye and the others were back, all but one boy who'd been killed in the fighting for no reason that anyone could say. Pinkeye went up alone to see how matters stood by light of day, complaining all the while that his old bones could not abide steps. When he returned, he told them that Harrenhal had been taken. "Them Bloody Mummers killed some of Ser Amory's lot in their beds, and the rest at table after they were good and drunk. The new lord will be here before the day's out, with his whole host. He's from the wild north up where that Wall is, and they say he's a hard one. This lord or that lord, there's still work to be done. Any foolery and I'll whip the skin off your back." He looked at Arya when he said that, but never said a word to her about where she had been the night before.</div>

<div class="line_en">All morning she watched the Bloody Mummers strip the dead of their valuables and drag the corpses to the Flowstone Yard, where a pyre was laid to dispose of them. Shagwell the Fool hacked the heads off two dead knights and pranced about the castle swinging them by the hair and making them talk. "What did you die of?" one head asked. "Hot weasel soup," replied the second.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya was set to mopping up dried blood. No one said a word to her beyond the usual, but every so often she would notice people looking at her strangely. Robett Glover and the other men they'd freed must have talked about what had happened down in the dungeon, and then Shagwell and his stupid talking heads started in about the weasel soup. She would have told him to shut up, but she was scared to. The fool was half-mad, and she'd heard that he'd once killed a man for not laughing at one of his japes. He better shut his mouth or I'll put him on my list with the rest, she thought as she scrubbed at a reddish-brown stain. It was almost evenfall when the new master of Harrenhal arrived. He had a plain face, beardless and ordinary, notable only for his queer pale eyes. Neither plump, thin, nor muscular, he wore black ringmail and a spotted pink cloak. The sigil on his banner looked like a man dipped in blood. "On your knees for the Lord of the Dreadfort!" shouted his squire, a boy no older than Arya, and Harrenhal knelt.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lord gave answer, but too softly for Arya to hear. Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey, freshly bathed and clad in clean new doublets and cloaks, came up to join them. After some brief talk, Ser Aenys led them over to Rorge and Biter. Arya was surprised to see them still here; somehow she would have expected them to vanish when Jaqen did. Arya heard the harsh sound of Rorge's voice, but not what he was saying. Then Shagwell pounced on her, dragging her out across the yard. "My lord, my lord," he sang, tugging at her wrist, "here's the weasel who made the soup!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Four Brave Companions climbed to the ramparts and hauled down the lion of Lannister and Ser Amory's own black manticore. In their place they raised the flayed man of the Dreadfort and the direwolf of Stark. And that evening, a page named Nan poured wine for Roose Bolton and Vargo Hoat as they stood on the gallery, watching the Brave Companions parade Ser Amory Lorch naked through the middle ward. Ser Amory pleaded and sobbed and clung to the legs of his captors, until Rorge pulled him loose, and Shagwell kicked him down into the bear pit.</div>
