<div class="line_en">When the girl was fifteen years old the godmother took ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, "My dear daughter, I feel that my end is near. I leave to you this little house, that will protect you from wind and weather; and also a spindle, a shuttle, and a needle, with which you can earn your living."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩十五岁的那年，她的教母突然病倒了。她把女孩叫到床边，对她说：「亲爱的孩子，我感觉我就要去了。我把这间小屋留给你，可以给你挡风遮雨。我把我用过的纺锤、梭子和针也留给你，你可以凭它们来糊口。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a girl whose father and mother died when she was still a little child. Her godmother lived all alone at the end of the village in a little house, and earned her living with spinning, weaving, and sewing. The old woman took the orphaned child into service and gave her a pious upbringing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前有个女孩，很小的时候父母就相继去世了。她的教母独自一人住在村头的一间小屋里，靠做针线活儿、纺纱和织布来维持生活。这位好心肠的妇人把这个孤儿接到家中，教她做活儿，培养她长大成了一个既孝顺又虔诚的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girl now lived all alone in the little house. She was industrious. She span, wove, and sewed; and everything she did was touched by the good old woman's blessing. It was as though the flax multiplied itself in her kitchen, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or a carpet, or sewed a shirt, she always immediately found a buyer who paid so well that she was never in need and always had something to share with others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教母去世以后，女孩独自一人生活着，勤劳地纺纱、织布、做针线活儿；而且好心肠的老教母的祝福使她免受了伤害。人们难免会揣测一番：她的亚麻老是用不完，而且她每织完一块布，或缝好一件衬衫，马上就会来个出好价的买主。这样一来，她不但没有受穷，而且还能分给穷人一些东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this time the king's son was traveling throughout the country in search of a bride. He wanted neither a poor one nor a rich one. He said, "My wife shall be the girl who is at the same time the poorest and the richest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个时候，王子正周游全国各地，打算物色一位王妃。他不能选择穷人家的姑娘，也不喜欢富家小姐。於是他说，他要物色一位最贫穷同时又最富有的姑娘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rich girl sat in her doorway in all her finery, and when the prince approached she bowed before him. He looked at her, said not a word, and rode on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位富家小姐身着节日盛装，坐在门前，看见王子走过来便站起身，迎上前去给他行礼，可是王子看了看她，便一言不发地走了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he came to the village where the girl lived he asked, as he had done everywhere, who was the richest girl and the poorest girl. First of all they named for him the richest girl, and then said that the poorest girl was the one who lived in the little house at the end of the village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子来到女孩居住的村庄，便按照他在其它地方的一惯作法，打听村子里哪个姑娘最贫穷同时又最富有。村民们马上告诉他，村里哪个姑娘最富有；至於最贫穷的姑娘嘛，当然就是独自住在村头小屋里的那个女孩了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he arrived at the poor girl's house she was not standing in the doorway, but instead was sitting in her little kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后王子来到最贫穷的姑娘的屋前；姑娘没有站在门前，而是把自己关在那间小屋子里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked up, and when she saw the prince looking in she blushed all over, closed her eyes, and continued to spin. I do not know if the thread was entirely even at this time, but she continued to spin until the prince had ridden away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="姑娘暗暗注意到，王子正在看着她，她羞得满脸通红，於是急忙垂下目光，继续纺纱。不过她这回儿纺的纱是否很均匀，我可就说不准喽。她一直纺啊纺啊，直到王子离开了才停下来。王子刚一离开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stopped his horse and looked into the window, through which the bright sun was shining, and saw the girl, sitting at her spinning wheel and diligently spinning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子在窗前停下脚步，透过窗子注视着屋里。阳光射进小屋，屋里一片明亮，姑娘正坐在纺车前纺纱，手脚灵巧，动作娴熟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl sat back down in the kitchen and continued to work at her spinning. Then a saying came to her that the old woman had sometimes said while she was at work, and she sang it thus:</div>

<div class="line_en">What happened? The spindled immediately jumped out of her hand and out the door. Amazed, she stood up and watched it as it danced merrily across the field, pulling along a glistening golden thread behind it. Before long it had disappeared from her eyes.</div>
