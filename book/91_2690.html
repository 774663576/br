<div class="line_en">"Lord, Lord!" he said to himself out loud, stretching and opening his eyes. "The death of the soul." The words attached themselves to some scene, to some room, to some past he had been dreaming of. It became clearer; the scene, the room, the past he had been dreaming of.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was at Bourton that summer, early in the 'nineties, when he was so passionately in love with Clarissa. There were a great many people there, laughing and talking, sitting round a table after tea and the room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke. They were talking about a man who had married his housemaid, one of the neighbouring squires, he had forgotten his name. He had married his housemaid, and she had been brought to Bourton to call -- an awful visit it had been. She was absurdly over-dressed, "like a cockatoo," Clarissa had said, imitating her, and she never stopped talking. On and on she went, on and on. Clarissa imitated her. Then somebody said -- Sally Seton it was -- did it make any real difference to one's feelings to know that before they'd married she had had a baby? (In those days, in mixed company, it was a bold thing to say.) He could see Clarissa now, turning bright pink; somehow contracting; and saying, "Oh, I shall never be able to speak to her again!" Whereupon the whole party sitting round the tea-table seemed to wobble. It was very uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是在90年代初，那年夏天在伯尔顿，当时他正热恋着克拉丽莎。当时那里人丁兴旺，人们围桌而坐，喝茶、聊天、玩笑，房间里沐浴着黄色的灯光，香烟把房间里的每个角落都弄得烟雾缭绕。他们谈论着一个娶了家中女仆的男人，是一个住在隔壁的乡绅，他忘记那人叫什么名字了。乡绅娶了自家的女仆，并带她来伯尔顿拜访——那是次糟糕的拜访。那女仆把自己打扮得花枝招展的，实在可笑，“像只花鹦鹉。”克拉丽莎曾模仿她的口气这么说过，而那个女人还老是说个没完。她唧唧呱呱，说个不停。克拉丽莎模仿她说话的样子。然后有个人问——是萨利·西顿——如果他知道她在婚前已有过一个孩子，那这事是否会影响他们的感情呢（在当时，在男女混杂的场合说出这种话，实属胆大妄为的事情）？他此时仿佛又看见了当年的克拉丽莎，她的脸涨得通红，恨不得有个地洞钻下去，她说道：“哦，我再也不想和她说话了！”于是，坐在茶桌边的所有人都似乎局促不安起来。那气氛真是尴尬极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He hadn't blamed her for minding the fact, since in those days a girl brought up as she was, knew nothing, but it was her manner that annoyed him; timid; hard; something arrogant; unimaginative; prudish. "The death of the soul." He had said that instinctively, ticketing the moment as he used to do -- the death of her soul.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有因为她介意这件事而责怪她，因为在那个时代像她那样被养育长大的姑娘基本上啥也不懂，但她的态度还是惹恼了他：害羞而又严肃，傲慢而又无趣，还有些呆板。“灵魂的死亡。”他刚才本能地说出了这句，像平日里一样，他把这个时刻贴上一张标签——灵魂的死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every one wobbled; every one seemed to bow, as she spoke, and then to stand up different. He could see Sally Seton, like a child who has been in mischief, leaning forward, rather flushed, wanting to talk, but afraid, and Clarissa did frighten people. (She was Clarissa's greatest friend, always about the place, totally unlike her, an attractive creature, handsome, dark, with the reputation in those days of great daring and he used to give her cigars, which she smoked in her bedroom. She had either been engaged to somebody or quarrelled with her family and old Parry disliked them both equally, which was a great bond.) Then Clarissa, still with an air of being offended with them all, got up, made some excuse, and went off, alone. As she opened the door, in came that great shaggy dog which ran after sheep. She flung herself upon him, went into raptures. It was as if she said to Peter -- it was all aimed at him, he knew --"I know you thought me absurd about that woman just now; but see how extraordinarily sympathetic I am; see how I love my Rob!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个人都慌里慌张。在她说话时，每个人都似乎在点头，然后又各说各的了。他能看到那时的萨利·西顿，像个喜欢恶作剧的小孩，身子前倾，脸红扑扑的，想要讲话，但又不敢，克拉丽莎真的把大家吓怔住了（她是克拉丽莎最要好的朋友，总是在克拉丽莎家玩，但她们俩是完全不同的两个人。萨利·西顿是个迷人的女子，漂亮，黑肤，那时候大家对她的评价是胆大妄为，他常给她雪茄，她就在卧室里抽。她不是和谁订了婚，就是和家人闹了别扭，老帕里对她和彼德两个都不喜欢，这正是使自己和萨利间建立起了友谊的主要原因）。然后，克拉丽莎依然带着一副所有人都冒犯了她的神气，站了起来，找了个借口，一个人走掉了。她打开门，那条毛茸茸的大牧羊犬跑了进来。她一下子抱住了它，欣喜若狂。彼德感觉她好像是在对他说话——一切都是冲着他的，他知道——“我知道你认为我刚刚对那个女人的态度很荒谬，可你看看我是个多么有爱心的人呀，看看我有多喜欢我的罗布呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She shut the door. At once he became extremely depressed. It all seemed useless -- going on being in love; going on quarrelling; going on making it up, and he wandered off alone, among outhouses, stables, looking at the horses. (The place was quite a humble one; the Parrys were never very well off; but there were always grooms and stable-boys about -- Clarissa loved riding -- and an old coachman -- what was his name?-- an old nurse, old Moody, old Goody, some such name they called her, whom one was taken to visit in a little room with lots of photographs, lots of bird-cages.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她关上门。他立刻变得极度沮丧。一切都似乎纯属浪费——继续爱着，继续吵着，继续装着。他独自溜达在外屋和马厩间，看着马匹（这地方很有些寒酸，帕里家从来也没富有过，但他家总有马夫和马童——克拉丽莎爱骑马——还有一个老车夫——他叫什么来着？——和一个老保姆，老穆迪，老古迪，别人好像都叫她这种名字，来找她的人会被带到一间小房间，那里挂着许多相片，还有许多鸟笼）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was an awful evening! He grew more and more gloomy, not about that only; about everything. And he couldn't see her; couldn't explain to her; couldn't have it out. There were always people about -- she'd go on as if nothing had happened. That was the devilish part of her -- this coldness, this woodenness, something very profound in her, which he had felt again this morning talking to her; an impenetrability. Yet Heaven knows he loved her. She had some queer power of fiddling on one's nerves, turning one's nerves to fiddle-strings, yes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个糟糕透顶的夜晚！他变得越来越沮丧，不仅仅因为那件事，而是因为一切。他无法面对克拉丽莎，无法向她解释，无法说出口来。那里总是有很多人——而她会表现得一如既往，就像什么也没发生一般。这是她身上恶魔般的部分——这种冷酷，这种呆板，埋藏在她的内心深处。今天早晨和她说话时他又再次感觉到了，她的心是那么深不可测。不过，上帝知道他爱她。她有一种挑拨人们神经的奇特力量，是的，她可以把你的神经挑拨成琴弦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had always this queer power of communicating without words. She knew directly he criticised her. Then she would do something quite obvious to defend herself, like this fuss with the dog -- but it never took him in, he always saw through Clarissa.

<div class="line_en">He had gone in to dinner rather late, from some idiotic idea of making himself felt, and had sat down by old Miss Parry -- Aunt Helena -- Mr. Parry's sister, who was supposed to preside. There she sat in her white Cashmere shawl, with her head against the window -- a formidable old lady, but kind to him, for he had found her some rare flower, and she was a great botanist, marching off in thick boots with a black collecting-box slung between her shoulders. He sat down beside her, and couldn't speak. Everything seemed to race past him; he just sat there, eating. And then half-way through dinner he made himself look across at Clarissa for the first time. She was talking to a young man on her right. He had a sudden revelation. "She will marry that man," he said to himself. He didn't even know his name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天他很晚才进去吃晚饭，因为想让别人注意到他，他坐在老帕里小姐边上——就是海伦娜姑妈——帕里先生的姐姐，她应该是餐前祷告的主持人。她披着白色的羊绒围巾坐在那儿，脑袋对着窗户——一个令人畏惧的老太太，不过对他很和善，因为他曾给过她一些稀有的花卉。她是个了不起的植物学家，时常穿着厚重的靴子，一只黑色的标本箱扛在肩头，出外去观赏植物。彼德在她身旁坐下，开不了口。一切似乎都在他身旁飞逝而去，而他只能坐在那儿，吃着饭。饭吃到一半的时候，他才头一回朝克拉丽莎那里瞄了一眼。她正在和坐在她右边的一个小伙子说话。他突然来了一种预感。“她会嫁给这个男人的。”他自言自语说。他那时甚至连此人的名字都还不知道呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For of course it was that afternoon, that very afternoon, that Dalloway had come over; and Clarissa called him "Wickham"; that was the beginning of it all. Somebody had brought him over; and Clarissa got his name wrong. She introduced him to everybody as Wickham. At last he said "My name is Dalloway!"-- that was his first view of Richard -- a fair young man, rather awkward, sitting on a deck-chair, and blurting out "My name is Dalloway!" Sally got hold of it; always after that she called him "My name is Dalloway!"</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a prey to revelations at that time. This one -- that she would marry Dalloway -- was blinding -- overwhelming at the moment. There was a sort of -- how could he put it?-- a sort of ease in her manner to him; something maternal; something gentle. They were talking about politics.

<div class="line_en">Afterwards he could remember standing by old Miss Parry's chair in the drawing-room. Clarissa came up, with her perfect manners, like a real hostess, and wanted to introduce him to some one -- spoke as if they had never met before, which enraged him. Yet even then he admired her for it. He admired her courage; her social instinct; he admired her power of carrying things through. "The perfect hostess," he said to her, whereupon she winced all over. But he meant her to feel it. He would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her with Dalloway. So she left him. And he had a feeling that they were all gathered together in a conspiracy against him -- laughing and talking -- behind his back. There he stood by Miss Parry's chair as though he had been cut out of wood, he talking about wild flowers. Never, never had he suffered so infernally! He must have forgotten even to pretend to listen; at last he woke up; he saw Miss Parry looking rather disturbed, rather indignant, with her prominent eyes fixed. He almost cried out that he couldn't attend because he was in Hell! People began going out of the room. He heard them talking about fetching cloaks; about its being cold on the water, and so on. They were going boating on the lake by moonlight -- one of Sally's mad ideas. He could hear her describing the moon. And they all went out. He was left quite alone.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你不想和他们一起去吗？”海伦娜姑妈说——老小姐帕里！——她已经猜到了。他转过身去，又看见了克拉丽莎。她是回来叫他的。他被她的宽仁、她的善良感动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come along," she said. "They're waiting." He had never felt so happy in the whole of his life! Without a word they made it up. They walked down to the lake. He had twenty minutes of perfect happiness. Her voice, her laugh, her dress (something floating, white, crimson), her spirit, her adventurousness; she made them all disembark and explore the island; she startled a hen; she laughed; she sang. And all the time, he knew perfectly well, Dalloway was falling in love with her; she was falling in love with Dalloway; but it didn't seem to matter. Nothing mattered. They sat on the ground and talked -- he and Clarissa. They went in and out of each other's minds without any effort. And then in a second it was over. He said to himself as they were getting into the boat, "She will marry that man," dully, without any resentment; but it was an obvious thing. Dalloway would marry Clarissa.</div>

<div class="line_en">For himself, he was absurd. His demands upon Clarissa (he could see it now) were absurd. He asked impossible things. He made terrible scenes. She would have accepted him still, perhaps, if he had been less absurd. Sally thought so. She wrote him all that summer long letters; how they had talked of him; how she had praised him, how Clarissa burst into tears! It was an extraordinary summer -- all letters, scenes, telegrams -- arriving at Bourton early in the morning, hanging about till the servants were up; appalling tête-à-têtes with old Mr. Parry at breakfast; Aunt Helena formidable but kind; Sally sweeping him off for talks in the vegetable garden; Clarissa in bed with headaches.</div>

<div class="line_en">The final scene, the terrible scene which he believed had mattered more than anything in the whole of his life (it might be an exaggeration -- but still so it did seem now) happened at three o'clock in the afternoon of a very hot day. It was a trifle that led up to it -- Sally at lunch saying something about Dalloway, and calling him "My name is Dalloway"; whereupon Clarissa suddenly stiffened, coloured, in a way she had, and rapped out sharply, "We've had enough of that feeble joke." That was all; but for him it was precisely as if she had said, "I'm only amusing myself with you; I've an understanding with Richard Dalloway." So he took it. He had not slept for nights. "It's got to be finished one way or the other," he said to himself. He sent a note to her by Sally asking her to meet him by the fountain at three.
