<div class="line_en">The graveyard proper ended at the bottom of the west side of the hill, beneath the old apple tree, with a fence of rust-brown iron railings, each topped with a small, rusting spearhead, but there was a wasteland beyond that, a mass of nettles and weeds, of brambles and autumnal rubbish, and Bod, who was, on the whole, obedient, did not push between the railings, but he went down there and looked through. He knew he wasn't being told the whole story, and it irritated him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坟场的边缘在西侧的山脚。在一棵年老的苹果树下，围着一排生锈的铁栏杆，栏杆上竖着一个个生锈的小尖头。越过栏杆是一片荒地，上头长着一大丛荨麻、野草和荆棘，落满了腐烂的秋日落叶。总体来说，伯蒂是个听话的孩子，他从未越过栏杆，只是透过栏杆间隙往另一边窥探过。他知道大人们没把全部真相如实相告，这让他有些恼火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bod went back up the hill, to the little chapel near the entrance to the graveyard, and he waited until it got dark. As twilight edged from grey to purple there was a noise in the spire, like a fluttering of heavy velvet, and Silas left his resting place in the belfry and clambered headfirst down the spire.</div>

"There are those," he said, in his silken voice, "who believe that all land is sacred. That it is sacred before we come to it, and sacred after. But here, in your land, they blessed the churches and the ground they set aside to bury people in, to make it holy. But they left land unconsecrated beside the sacred ground, Potter's Fields to bury the criminals and the suicides or those who were not of the faith."</div>

<div class="line_en">Silas raised one perfect eyebrow. "Mm? Oh, not at all. Let's see, it's been a while since I've been down that way. But I don't remember anyone particularly evil. Remember, in days gone by you could be hanged for stealing a shilling. And there are always people who find their lives have become so unsupportable they believe the best thing they could do would be to hasten their transition to another plane of existence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赛拉斯扬起一边漂亮的眉毛。“哦？也不能这么说。让我想想，我在坟场待了很久，但我不记得哪个人特别坏。要知道，在过去，你可能因为偷了一先令就被绞死。还有些觉得自己活不下去的人，会相信最好的办法是让自己过渡到另一个层面。”">查看中文翻译</div>

In the twilight of the graveyard there was a silent implosion, a flutter of velvet darkness, and Silas was gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were some lessons that Bod had mastered. He had eaten a bellyful of unripe apples, sour and white-pipped, from the tree some years before, and had regretted it for days, his guts cramping and painful while Mrs. Owens lectured him on what not to eat.

He had finished the last of the apples the week before, but he liked the apple tree as a place to think.</div>

<div class="line_en">He edged up the trunk, to his favorite place in the crook of two branches, and looked down at the Potter's Field below him, a brambly patch of weeds and unmown grass in the moonlight. He wondered whether the witch would be old and iron-toothed and travel in a house on chicken legs, or whether she would be thin and sharp-nosed and carry a broomstick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他慢慢爬上树干，来到他最爱的树丫上，望着下方的陶工之地。月光下，陶工之地遍地荆棘，杂草丛生。不知那个女巫是年老色衰，铁齿钢牙，住在一座由鸡腿驱动的房子里？还是瘦骨嶙峋，鼻子尖尖，带着一条扫帚呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

"They come to my little cottage at dawn, before I'm proper awake, and drags me out onto the Green. 'You're a witch!' they shouts, fat and fresh-scrubbed all pink in the morning, like so many pigwiggins scrubbed clean for market day. One by one they gets up beneath the sky and tells of milk gone sour and horses gone lame, and finally Mistress Jemima gets up, the fattest, pinkest, best-scrubbed of them all, and tells how as Solomon Porritt now cuts her dead and instead hangs around the washhouse like a wasp about a honeypot, and it's all my magic, says she, that made him so and the poor young man must be bespelled. So they strap me to the cucking stool and forces it under the water of the duckpond, saying if I'm a witch I'll neither drown nor care, but if I am not a witch I'll feel it. And Mistress Jemima's father gives them each a silver groat to hold the stool down under the foul green water for a long time, to see if I'd choke on it."</div>

She still looked like a goblin, but now she looked like a pretty goblin, and Bod didn't think she would have needed magic to attract Solomon Porritt, not with a smile like that. "What nonsense. Of course I was a witch. They learned that when they untied me from the cucking stool and stretched me on the Green, nine-parts dead and all covered with duckweed and stinking pond-muck. I rolled my eyes back in my head, and I cursed each and every one of them there on the village Green that morning, that none of them would ever rest easily in a grave. I was surprised at how easily it came, the cursing. Like dancing it was, when your feet pick up the steps of a new measure your ears have never heard and your head don't know, and they dance it till dawn." She stood, and twirled, and kicked, and her bare feet flashed in the moonlight. "That was how I cursed them, with my last gurgling pond-watery breath. And then I expired. They burned my body on the Green until I was nothing but blackened charcoal, and they popped me in a hole in the Potter's Field without so much as a headstone to mark my name," and it was only then that she paused, and seemed, for a moment, wistful.</div>

But it turned out there was more in that carpet than strong wool and good weaving, for it carried the plague in its pattern, and by Monday five of them were coughing blood, and their skins were gone as black as mine when they hauled me from the fire.

<div class="line_en">As long as he had been going to the hut there had been a brown workingman's jacket hanging on the back of the door, forgotten or abandoned years before, along with a green-stained pair of gardening jeans. The jeans were much too big for him, but he rolled up the cuffs until his feet showed, then he made a belt out of brown garden-twine, and tied it around his waist. There were boots in one corner, and he tried putting them on, but they were so big and encrusted with mud and concrete that he could barely shuffle in them, and if he took a step, the boots remained on the floor of the shed. He pushed the jacket out through the space in the loose board, squeezed himself out, then put it on. If he rolled up the sleeves, he decided, it worked quite well. It had big pockets, and he thrust his hands into them, and felt quite the dandy.</div>

<div class="line_en">A business like Abanazer Bolger's brought in strange people, but the boy who came in that morning was one of the strangest Abanazer could remember in a lifetime of cheating strange people out of their valuables. He looked to be about seven years old, and dressed in his grandfather's clothes. He smelled like a shed. His hair was long and shaggy, and he seemed extremely grave. His hands were deep in the pockets of a dusty brown jacket, but even with the hands out of sight, Abanazer could see that something was clutched extremely tightly -- protectively -- in the boy's right hand.</div>

He took an eyepiece from the countertop and he screwed it into his eye. He turned on a little light on the counter and examined the brooch through the eyeglass. "Snakestone?" he said, to himself, not to the boy. Then he took the eyepiece out, replaced his glasses, and fixed the boy with a sour and suspicious look. "Where did you get this?"

<div class="line_en">There was a small desk beside the door, and Abanazer Bolger pulled up the only chair, and sat down, letting Bod stand. Abanazer rummaged in a drawer, in which Bod could see a half-empty bottle of whisky, and pulled out an almost-finished packet of chocolate chip cookies, and he offered one to the boy; he turned on the desk light, looked at the brooch again, the swirls of red and orange in the stone, and he examined the black metal band that encircled it, suppressing a little shiver at the expression on the heads of the snake-things. "This is old," he said. "It's"-- priceless, he thought --"probably not really worth much, but you never know."</div>

<div class="line_en">Bod was walking, sleepily and a little gingerly, past the small tomb of the wonderfully named Miss Liberty Roach (What she spent is lost, what she gave remains with her always. Reader be Charitable), past the final resting place of Harrison Westwood, Baker of this Parish, and his wives, Marion and Joan, to the Potter's Field. Mr. and Mrs. Owens had died several hundred years before it had been decided that beating children was wrong and Mr. Owens had, regretfully, that night, done what he saw as his duty, and Bod's bottom stung like anything. Still, the look of worry on Mrs. Owens's face had hurt Bod worse than any beating could have done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯蒂睡意蒙眬、小心翼翼地走在路上，路过名字耐人寻味的黎蓓黛·罗奇[3]小姐（她所消耗的已永远消失，她所给予的将伴她永存。望见此者予以善意与仁慈）的墓，路过教区面包师哈里森·威斯伍德及他的两位妻子——玛丽恩和琼的墓，来到陶工之地。打孩子是不对的——问题是在这一观念为世人所认可的几百年前，欧文斯夫妇就去世了。因此这一夜，欧文斯先生满心歉疚地履行了他的职责。伯蒂的屁股火辣辣地疼，然而，欧文斯太太脸上担忧的神情远比挨揍更来得让他受伤。【注：[3]黎蓓黛·罗奇：原文为Liberty Roach，字面义为自由·蟑螂。】">查看中文翻译</div>
