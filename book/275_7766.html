<div class="line_en">Now it happened that one day his father said to him, "Listen, you there in the corner. You are getting big and strong. You too will have to learn something by which you can earn your bread. See how your brother puts himself out, but there seems to be no hope for you."</div>

<div class="line_en">A father had two sons. The oldest one was clever and intelligent, and knew how to manage everything, but the youngest one was stupid and could neither understand nor learn anything. When people saw him, they said, "He will be a burden on his father!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有位父亲，膝下有两个儿子。大儿子聪明伶俐，遇事都能应付自如；小儿子呢，却呆头呆脑，啥也不懂，还啥也不学，人们看见他时都异口同声地说：「他父亲为他得操多少心哪！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now when something had to be done, it was always the oldest son who had to do it. However, if the father asked him fetch anything when it was late, or even worse, at night, and if the way led through the churchyard or some other spooky place, he would always answer, "Oh, no, father, I won't go there. It makes me shudder!" For he was afraid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遇到有甚么事儿要办的时候，总得大儿子出面去办；不过，要是天晚了，或者深更半夜的时候，父亲还要他去取甚么东西的话，而且要路过墓地，或者其它令人毛骨悚然的地方，他就会回答说：「啊，爸爸，我可不去，我害怕！」他是真的害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the evening by the fire when stories were told that made one's flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said, "Oh, that makes me shudder!" The youngest son would sit in a corner and listen with the others, but he could not imagine what they meant. "they are always saying, 'It makes me shudder! It makes me shudder!' It does not make me shudder. That too must be a skill that I do not understand."</div>

<div class="line_en">The oldest son laughed when he heard that, and thought to himself, "Dear God, what a dimwit that brother of mine is. Nothing will come of him as long as he lives. As the twig is bent, so grows the tree." the father sighed, and answered him, "You may well learn to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by shuddering."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哥哥听了这话，哈哈大笑起来，心想，「我的天哪，我弟弟可真是个傻瓜蛋；他一辈子都没甚么指望了。三岁看小，七岁看老嘛。」父亲歎了一口气，对小儿子回答说：「我保证，你早晚能学会害怕；不过，靠害怕是养活不了自己的。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If there is nothing more than that," replied the sexton, "he can learn that with me. Just send him to me. I will plane off his rough edges."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the boy shouted to him for the third time, and as that also was to no avail, he ran toward him and pushed the ghost down the stairs. It fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Then the boy rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed and fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着小伙子第三次沖他吼叫，可还是没有一点儿用，於是小伙子猛扑过去，一把将鬼怪推下了楼梯。鬼怪在楼梯上翻滚了十多级，才躺在墙角不动了。接着小伙子去敲钟，敲完钟回到了他自己的房间后，一言未发，倒头便睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few days later the sexton awoke him at midnight and told him to get up, climb the church tower, and ring the bell. "You will soon learn what it is to shudder," he thought.

After the boy had reached the top of the tower, had turned around and was about to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the steps opposite the sound hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后的一个深夜，执事把小儿子叫醒，要他起床后到教堂钟楼上去敲钟。「这回我要教教你甚么是害怕。」执事心里想着，随后悄悄地先上了钟楼。小儿子来到钟楼，转身去抓敲钟的绳子的时候，却发现一个白色的人影儿，正对着窗口站在楼梯上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Father," he replied, "do listen to me. I am completely innocent. He was standing there in the night like someone with evil intentions. I did not know who it was, and I warned him three times to speak or to go away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「爸爸，」小伙子申辩说，「一点儿都不怪我呀。您听我说：他深更半夜的站在那里，好像是来干坏事的。我哪里知道那是谁呀！我一连三次大声地告诉他，要么答腔儿，要么走开。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the boy went to the gallows, sat down beneath them, and waited until evening. Because he was cold, he made himself a fire. However, at midnight there came up such a cold wind that in spite of his fire he could not get warm. And as the wind pushed the hanged men against each other, causing them to move to and fro, he thought, "You are freezing down here next to the fire. Those guys up there must really be freezing and suffering." Feeling pity for them, he put up the ladder, and climbed up, untied them, one after the other, and then brought down all seven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小伙子说完就朝绞架走去，然后坐在绞架的下面，等着夜幕的降临。他坐在那里感到很冷，於是就生起了一堆火。可是夜半风起，寒冷难耐，他虽然烤着火，还是感到很冷。寒风吹得吊着的死屍荡来荡去，相互碰撞。他心想，「我坐在火堆旁还感到挺冷的，那几个可怜的傢伙吊在那里，该多冷呀。」小伙子的心肠可真好：他搭起梯子，然后爬上去，解开了这些被绞死的强盗身上的绳索，再一个接一个地把他们放下来。接着他把火拨旺，吹了又吹，使火堆熊熊燃烧起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If there is nothing more than that," answered the boy, "I can do it easily. But if I learn how to shudder that quickly, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me tomorrow morning."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he stirred up the fire, blew into it, and set them all around it to warm themselves. But they just sat there without moving, and their clothes caught fire.

<div class="line_cn" title="然后他把他们抱过来，围着火堆坐了一圈，让他们暖暖身子。可是这些傢伙坐在那里纹丝不动，甚至火烧着了他们的衣服，他们还是一动也不动。於是小伙子对他们说：「你们在干甚么？小心点啊！要不我就把你们再吊上去。」可是这些被绞死的强盗根本听不见他的话，他们仍然一声不吭，让自己的破衣烂衫被火烧着。">查看中文翻译</div>
