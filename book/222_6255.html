<div class="line_en">"She may be beautiful," I thought,"but she's not very polite." I passed by her chair, and cleverly dropped Mrs Dean's note in front of her, so that Hareton wouldn't see it. She, however, just said aloud, "What's that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她也许漂亮，”我想，“可她太无礼了。”走过她的椅子时我巧妙地把迪恩夫人的便条丢在她面前，这样哈里顿就看不见了。可她却大声说道，“那是什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">1802 After hearing the end of Mrs Dean's story, I made my plans for the future. I decided I did not want to spend another winter at the Grange, and told her I would ride to the Heights to inform my landlord. She handed me a letter to give to Cathy Heathcliff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1802年。听完了迪恩夫人的故事，我为自己的将来做好了计划。我拿定主意不想在画眉山庄过第二个冬天了，我告诉她我要骑马到呼啸山庄去通知我的房东。她交给我一封信要我带给凯茜·希斯克利夫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A letter from the housekeeper at the Grange," I said, annoyed with her. She gasped, and tried to pick it up, but Hareton got there first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“画眉山庄女管家的信，”我说，有些生她的气。她愣了一下，刚想要拣起来，但哈里顿先拿到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr Heathcliff will want to look at this," he said, putting it in his pocket. But when Cathy pretended to cry, Hareton could not bear to make her sad, and he threw the letter down on the table. She eagerly read every word, and asked me several questions about the people at the Grange.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“希斯克利夫先生会想看看的，”他说，把信揣进了口袋里。可当凯茜假装哭的时候，哈里顿不忍让她伤心，把信扔到桌子上。她急切地读着每一个字，还问了我几个关于画眉山庄里的人的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I always used to read so much that Mr Heathcliff decided to take away my only pleasure and destroy my books. I've looked all over the house for them. Joseph only reads the Bible, but some of my books are in Hareton's room! Why did you take them, Hareton? Just because you enjoy stealing? They can't be any use to you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我过去总是很喜欢读书，所以希斯克利夫先生决定剥夺我唯一的乐趣，把我的书毁掉。我整个屋子都找遍了。约瑟夫只读《圣经》，可我的一些书却在哈里顿的房间里！你为什么要拿那些书，哈里顿？只是因为你喜欢偷东西吗？它们对你没什么用！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Several months later, in September, I was travelling to visit friends in Yorkshire. I found myself near Thrushcross Grange, and decided to spend a night there. After all, I was still paying rent for it. When I arrived, I was surprised to find a different housekeeper, who told me Mrs Dean had become housekeeper at the Heights. I wanted to have a walk after travelling all day, so I left orders for the woman to cook my supper and prepare bedroom for me, and I walked the four miles to Wuthering Heights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个月之后，正值9月，我去看望在约克郡的朋友，途中我发现自己离画眉山庄不远，于是决定去那儿过一夜。没想到到了那儿却发现管家已换了个人，新的管家告诉我迪恩夫人已到呼啸山庄去做管家了。经过一整天的旅行我想散散步，于是吩咐女管家为我做好晚餐，准备一间卧室，然后我步行四英里去呼啸山庄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not enjoy lunch with my two silent companions, and left the Heights straight afterwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟两位默不作声的人一起用午餐真不是件乐事，之后我就直接离开了呼啸山庄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What a pity," I thought, "that Cathy Heathcliff and I didn't fall in love, as Mrs Dean would have liked! Then I could have taken her away from this miserable place for ever!"</div>

<div class="line_en">As I came close to the old house, I noticed that there were flowers in the garden, and the doors and windows stood open. I could see two people inside, and I stopped for a moment, curious to hear a little of their conversation.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You must kiss me if I get it right," answered a deep voice. The man was sitting at a table, reading from a book. His handsome face shone with pleasure, and his eyes often left the book to look at the small white hand that lay on his shoulder. The girl stood behind him, bending over to help him. Her face -- it was fortunate he could not see her face, or he would never have been able to concentrate on his studies. I could see it, and I was bitterly sorry that I had thrown away my chance of seeing that beauty every day of my life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要是读对了你一定要吻我，”一个低沉的声音回答。这个人坐在桌旁，正读一本书。他英俊的面庞洋溢着喜悦的光彩，他的双眼不时离开书本看着搭在他肩上的白皙的小手。那姑娘站在他身后，弯着腰辅导他。她的面庞——幸亏他看不到她的面庞，否则他决不能集中精神学习。可我能看到这面庞，我真是懊悔自己丢掉了此生终日与这个美人相见的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Read it again, stupid!" said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. "Read it correctly this time, or I'll pull your hair!"</div>
