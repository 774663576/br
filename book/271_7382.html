Washington State was close enough that Rachel didn't have the same defense. She'd taken classes straight through the summer semesters, working double shifts over the holidays at some cafe on campus.

<div class="line_en">The highway was busy with tourist traffic; I wove in and out of the cars, earning a bunch of honks and a few fingers. I took the turn onto the 101 at seventy, not bothering to look. I had to ride the line for a minute to avoid getting smeared by a minivan. Not that it would have killed me, but it would have slowed me down. Broken bones -- the big ones, at least -- took days to heal completely, as I had good cause to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整条高速公路上满是旅游的车流，我在车与车之间来回穿梭，换来了不少喇叭声和中指。我连看都没看就以70码的速度转上101国道。我保持在自己的车道上骑行了有一分钟，是为了避免与一辆轻型货车发生碰擦。不是因为它会造成我死亡，而是有可能会减慢我的速度。摔断骨头——起码是较大的那些——需要几天才能完全恢复，这点我知道得很清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The freeway cleared up a little, and I pushed the bike to eighty. I didn't touch the brake until I was close to the narrow drive; I figured I was in the clear then. Sam wouldn't come this far to stop me. It was too late.</div>
