<div class="line_en">Though the Mother Superior talked with Kitty not more than three or four times and once or twice for but ten minutes the impression she made upon Kitty was profound. Her character was like a country which on first acquaintance seems grand, but inhospitable; but in which presently you discover smiling little villages among fruit trees in the folds of the majestic mountains and pleasant ambling rivers that flow kindly through lush meadows. But these comfortable scenes, though they surprise and even reassure you, are not enough to make you feel at home in the land of tawny heights and windswept spaces. It would have been impossible to become intimate with the Mother Superior; she had that something impersonal about her which Kitty had felt with the other nuns, even with the good-humoured chatty Sister St Joseph, but with her it was a barrier which was almost palpable. It gave you quite a curious sensation, chilling but awe-inspiring, that she could walk on the same earth as you, attend to mundane affairs, and yet live so obviously upon a plane you could not reach. She once said to Kitty:</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening the two of them were sitting together. The days were shortening now and the mellow light of the evening was agreeable and a little melancholy. The Mother Superior looked very tired. Her tragic face was drawn and white; her fine dark eyes had lost their fire. Her fatigue perhaps urged her to a rare mood of confidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天傍晚两人又坐到了一起。白天比往常短了，傍晚的阳光十分柔和，甚至勾起人的伤感之情。修道院长看上去相当疲惫，她悲天悯人的脸紧紧地绷着，脸色略显苍白。看来她需要时间来集聚精力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is not enough that a religious should be continually in prayer with Jesus; she should be herself a prayer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一位修女光是对耶稣祷告是不够的，她还要成为自己的祈祷者。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though her conversation was interwoven with her religion, Kitty felt that this was natural to her and that no effort was made to influence the heretic. It seemed strange to her that the Mother Superior, with her deep sense of charity, should be content to leave Kitty in a condition of what must seem to her sinful ignorance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的话显然是依附于天主教的教义，但是在凯蒂听来，似乎是从她的心里自然而然流淌出来的，丝毫没有向一个异教徒说教的意味。凯蒂对此颇觉奇怪，因为凯蒂对上帝的无知是有罪的，而深怀仁厚大义的修道院长竟然默默认同，不施灌输。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is a memorable day for me, my child," she said breaking from a long reverie, "for this is the anniversary of the day on which I finally determined to enter religion. For two years I had been thinking of it, but I had suffered as it were a fear of this calling, for I dreaded that I might be recaptured by the spirit of the world. But that morning when I communicated I made the vow that I would before nightfall announce my wish to my dear mother. After I had received the Holy Communion I asked Our Lord to give me peace of mind: Thou shalt have it only, the answer seemed to come to me, when thou hast ceased to desire it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今天对我来说是个值得纪念的日子，我的孩子。”她停止了长时间的冥想，开口说道，“这是我最终决定入教那天的纪念日。皈依的问题我思索了两年，面对主的召唤，我备受折磨，因为我怕皈依我主之后会再次受到魔鬼的蛊惑。但是在我将领受圣餐的那天早上，我发下了誓言，我要在夜晚降临之前把我的理想告诉亲爱的母亲。接受圣餐时我祈求上帝赐予我心灵的宁静。你终将享有宁静，当你忘记了对宁静的渴求时，宁静就会降临了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is strange how vividly I remember the scene. We were sitting round the table, a round table covered with a red cloth, and we worked by the light of a lamp with a green shade. My two cousins were staying with us and we were all working at tapestries to recover the chairs in the drawing-room. Imagine, they had not been recovered since the days of Louis XIV, when they were bought, and they were so shabby and faded, my mother said it was a disgrace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很奇怪，当时的场景我至今还历历在目。我们围坐在餐桌旁，桌子上铺着一块红桌布，屋子里有一盏盖了绿色灯罩的灯，我们就在灯光下做活儿。我的两个表姐和我们在一块儿，大家一起修补客厅椅子上的坐毯。想想看，那些东西自从路易十四那会儿买来就没修补过，年长破旧，色也褪了。妈妈说这是很不体面的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That day, one of our friends, Madame de Viernot, had left for the Carmel without telling any of her relatives. She knew that they were opposed to her step, but she was a widow and thought that as such she had the right to do as she chose. One of my cousins had gone to bid farewell to the dear fugitive and did not come back till the evening. She was much moved. I had not spoken to my mother, I trembled at the thought of telling her what I had in mind, and yet I wished to keep the resolution I had made at Holy Communion. I asked my cousin all manner of questions. My mother, who appeared to be absorbed in her tapestry, lost no word. While I talked I said to myself: If I want to speak to-day I have not a minute to lose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那天，我们的一个朋友，维埃拿夫人，没有告诉任何一个亲戚就不辞而别去了卡梅尔。她知道他们必定会反对，但是这位寡妇认为她有权作出自己的选择。我的一位表姐前去和她这位亲密的朋友道别，到了傍晚才回来。回来的时候她的心情十分悲痛。那时我还没有跟我的妈妈说，一想到我要把我心里的想法告诉她，我就全身颤抖。但是我必须遵守接受圣餐时作出的决定。我问了表姐很多有关那个寡妇的问题，我妈妈看上去一门心思忙于她的织补活计，但是我们所谈之事她一个字也没落下。我一边和表姐说着话，一边心里想：如果今天要向母亲开口，现在就一分钟也不能耽搁了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My mother made no answer and I repented because I had not dared to explain myself. I seemed to hear the word of Our Lord to St Peter: 'Peter, lovest thou me?' Oh, what weakness, what ingratitude was mine! I loved my comfort, the manner of my life, my family and my diversions. I was lost in these bitter thoughts when a little later, as though the conversation had not been interrupted, my mother said to me: 'Still, my Odette, I do not think that you will die without having done something that will endure.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我妈妈没再说什么，而我却因为没有说出心里话悔恨不已。我似乎听到了耶稣对圣彼得说的话：‘彼得，你不爱我吗？’呃，我那颗易受蛊惑的心，我那颗忘恩负义的心啊！我舍不得舒适的生活，舍不得我的家人，舍不得我的娱乐消遣。在我陷入这些痛苦的想法时，没过一会儿，我妈妈又对我开了口，好像谈话根本没有间断过一样，她说：‘我的奥德特，对你来说，不做亏心事，就不怕鬼敲门。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried to form the words, but my lips would not move; and then, suddenly, after a few minutes of silence my mother said to me: 'I really cannot understand the conduct of your friend. I do not like this leaving without a word all those to whom she is so dear. The gesture is theatrical and offends my taste. A well-bred woman does nothing which shall make people talk of her. I hope that if ever you caused us the great sorrow of leaving us you would not take flight as though you were committing a crime.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我竭力地想好了要说的话，可是我的嘴唇却张不开。沉默了一会儿之后，我的妈妈突然对我说：‘你那位朋友的做法我很看不惯。对亲近的人不辞而别不会让人有多好受。她的姿态有些出格儿，很不合我的胃口。一个有教养的女人不会做出惹人口舌的事儿来。我希望如果你有朝一日也要离我们而去，致使我们悲痛万分，千万不要像犯了罪似的逃之夭夭。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
