<div class="line_en">"It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them -- frills and frills," she whispered to her friend Jessie as she bent over her geography. "I saw her shaking them out. I heard Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous for a child. My mamma says that children should be dressed simply. She has got one of those petticoats on now. I saw it when she sat down."</div>

<div class="line_en">When Sara entered the schoolroom the next morning everybody looked at her with wide, interested eyes. By that time every pupil -- from Lavinia Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, to Lottie Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school -- had heard a great deal about her. They knew very certainly that she was Miss Minchin's show pupil and was considered a credit to the establishment. One or two of them had even caught a glimpse of her French maid, Mariette, who had arrived the evening before. Lavinia had managed to pass Sara's room when the door was open, and had seen Mariette opening a box which had arrived late from some shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="次日早晨萨拉走进教室时，每个人都好奇地睁大眼睛望着她。那时，所有的学生来自拉维尼娅·赫伯特，她还不到十三岁，却觉得已是个十足的大姑娘了，到洛蒂·利，才只四岁，是学校里的婴儿——都听说过很多关于萨拉的事了。她们明确知道她是为铭钦女士炫耀门面的学生，并且被认为是这所学校的荣誉。她们中有一两个甚至看到过一眼她那昨晚抵达的法国侍女马里耶特。拉维尼娅曾有意地走过萨拉的房门前，从开着的门中看到马里耶特正打开一只很晚才从商店送到的盒子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh," sniffed Lavinia, spitefully, "that is the way her slippers are made. My mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if you have a clever shoemaker. I don't think she is pretty at all. Her eyes are such a queer color."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哼”拉维尼娅嗤之以鼻，不怀好意地说“那是她绣鞋的做法关系。我妈说过，如果你找个手巧的鞋匠，就是大脚也能看上去像是小的。我认为她根本不漂亮。她眼睛的颜色很怪”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara was sitting quietly in her seat, waiting to be told what to do. She had been placed near Miss Minchin's desk. She was not abashed at all by the many pairs of eyes watching her. She was interested and looked back quietly at the children who looked at her. She wondered what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if they cared for their lessons, and if any of them had a papa at all like her own. She had had a long talk with Emily about her papa that morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was a child full of imaginings and whimsical thoughts, and one of her fancies was that there would be a great deal of comfort in even pretending that Emily was alive and really heard and understood. After Mariette had dressed her in her dark-blue schoolroom frock and tied her hair with a dark-blue ribbon, she went to Emily, who sat in a chair of her own, and gave her a book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是个富于想象力的儿童，充满了奇思怪想，她的幻想之一就是假定埃米莉是活的，并且真的能听懂她的话，她想即使如此，也能从中得到莫大的安慰。等马里耶特帮她穿好了上课时穿的深蓝色连衣裙、用深蓝色的缎带束起了她的头发，她走到埃米莉自己的座椅前，交给她一本书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What I believe about dolls," she said, "is that they can do things they will not let us know about. Perhaps, really, Emily can read and talk and walk, but she will only do it when people are out of the room. That is her secret. You see, if people knew that dolls could do things, they would make them work. So, perhaps, they have promised each other to keep it a secret. If you stay in the room, Emily will just sit there and stare; but if you go out, she will begin to read, perhaps, or go and look out of the window. Then if she heard either of us coming, she would just run back and jump into her chair and pretend she had been there all the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“关于洋娃娃，我相信的是”她说“她们能够做不愿让我们知道的事情。也许埃米莉真的能够读书、讲话、走路，但是她只在人们离开房间以后才这样做。那是她的秘密。你想，如果人们知道洋娃娃们能做事情，就会让她们干活。也许她们曾经互相约定要严守秘密。如果你呆在室内，埃米莉就只顾静坐呆望，但是，如果你走出去了，她就会开始读书，或许走到窗前眺望。那时候如果她听到我们中有谁来了，她就会跑回去，跳进椅子，假装是一直坐在那儿的”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Comme elle est drole!" Mariette said to herself, and when she went downstairs she told the head housemaid about it. But she had already begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small face and such perfect manners. She had taken care of children before who were not so polite. Sara was a very fine little person, and had a gentle, appreciative way of saying, "If you please, Mariette," "Thank you, Mariette," which was very charming. Mariette told the head housemaid that she thanked her as if she was thanking a lady.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是多么滑稽啊”马里耶特用法语自言自语。她下了楼，对领头的女仆说起了这事。但是她已经开始喜欢这个奇特的小姑娘了，这孩子有如此聪慧的小脸蛋儿和如此完美的举止。她以前照管的儿童都没这样有礼貌。萨拉是个很好的小人儿，说起话来温文尔雅，带着感激的意味“劳驾，马里耶”，“谢谢，马里耶”。说得多么招人喜欢。马里耶特告诉领头的女仆说，萨拉向她道谢的口气就像是在向贵妇人道谢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Young ladies," she said, "I wish to introduce you to your new companion." All the little girls rose in their places, and Sara rose also.

As soon as lessons are over you must make each other's acquaintance."</div>

<div class="line_en">If Sara had been older or less punctilious about being quite polite to people, she could have explained herself in a very few words. But, as it was, she felt a flush rising on her cheeks. Miss Minchin was a very severe and imposing person, and she seemed so absolutely sure that Sara knew nothing whatever of French that she felt as if it would be almost rude to correct her. The truth was that Sara could not remember the time when she had not seemed to know French. Her father had often spoken it to her when she had been a baby. Her mother had been a French woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her language, so it happened that Sara had always heard and been familiar with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果萨拉年龄稍大一些，或者不太拘泥于待人有礼貌的话，她原是能用很少几句话就为自己解释清楚的。可是，幼小拘礼的她感到一阵羞红涌上双颊。铭钦女士是个十分严厉、盛气凌人的人物，她似乎绝对肯定萨拉对法语一无所知，于是觉得若去纠正萨拉就显得笨拙了。实际情况是萨拉已记不清楚自己早在什么时候就懂法语了。当她还是婴儿时，父亲就常对她讲法语。她母亲是法国人，而克鲁上尉喜爱她的语言，所以萨拉能经常听到法语并熟悉它。">查看中文翻译</div>

She knew it would be rude to smile, and she was very determined not to be rude. But it was very odd to find herself expected to study a page which told her that "le pere" meant "the father," and "la mere" meant "the mother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉感到双颊发热。她回到座位上，打开那本书，面带愁容地看着第一页。她知道面带笑容是非礼的，她决计不做失礼的事。但是令人啼笑皆非的是竟然指望她学习这样一页法语书，上面教给“le pèr”的意思“父”“la mèr”的意思“母”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of Miss Minchin's chief secret annoyances was that she did not speak French herself, and was desirous of concealing the irritating fact. She, therefore, had no intention of discussing the matter and laying herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铭钦女士有些不愿告人的烦恼，其中最主要的就是她本人不会说法语，她想隐瞒这个痛心的实情。所以她无意谈论此事，以免在这新来的小学生的幼稚无端的询问中暴露自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and sat staring at her over her eyeglasses, almost indignantly, until she had finished. Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his smile was one of great pleasure. To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in his native land -- which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed worlds away. When she had finished, he took the phrase book from her, with a look almost affectionate. But he spoke to Miss Minchin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她开始讲话时，铭钦女士猛然一惊，坐在那儿几乎是愤怒地从眼镜上方盯着她，直到她把话讲完。杜法奇先生露出笑容，那是十分欣喜的微笑。聆听这悦耳的童音讲他的家乡话，讲得如此纯真、如此迷人，使他觉得宛如回到了故乡——这在伦敦晦暗多雾的日子里，有时显得好像远在天地之外。萨拉讲完后，他从她手里拿了那本语言书，流露出近乎慈爱的目光。于是他对铭钦女士讲话了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Little Sara rose in her seat. She was beginning to feel rather desperate, as if she were almost in disgrace. She looked up into Monsieur Dufarge's face with her big, green-gray eyes, and they were quite innocently appealing. She knew that he would understand as soon as she spoke. She began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent French. Madame had not understood. She had not learned French exactly -- not out of books -- but her papa and other people had always spoken it to her, and she had read it and written it as she had read and written English. Her papa loved it, and she loved it because he did. Her dear mamma, who had died when she was born, had been French. She would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her, but what she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words in this book -- and she held out the little book of phrases.</div>
