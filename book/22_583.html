<div class="line_en">I imagine a table, slick with blood. The blood is my mother's. There is too much of it. There is so much of it, I think it runs, like ink. I think, to save the boards beneath, the women have set down china bowls; and so the silences between my mother's cries are filled -- drip drop! drip drop! -- with what might be the staggered beating of clocks. Beyond the beat come other, fainter cries: the shrieks of lunatics, the shouts and scolds of nurses. For this is a madhouse. My mother is mad. The table has straps upon it to keep her from plunging to the floor; another strap separates her jaws, to prevent the biting of her tongue; another keeps apart her legs, so that I might emerge from between them. When I am born, the straps remain: the women fear she will tear me in two! They put me upon her bosom and my mouth finds out her breast. I suck, and the house falls silent about me. There is only, still, that falling blood -- drip drop! drip, drop! -- the beat telling off the first few minutes of my life, the last of hers. For soon, the clocks run slow. My mother's bosom rises, falls, rises again; then sinks for ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">I pass my first ten years a daughter to the nurses of the house. I believe they love me. There is a tabby cat upon the wards, and I think they keep me, rather as they keep that cat, a thing to pet and dress with ribbons. I wear a slate-grey gown cut like their own, an apron and a cap; they give me a belt with a ring of miniature keys upon it, and call me "little nurse". I sleep with each of them in turn, in their own beds, and follow them in their duties upon the madhouse wards. The house is a large one -- seems larger to me, I suppose -- and divided in two: one side for female lunatics, one side for male. I see only the female. I never mind them. Some of them kiss and pet me, as the nurses do. Some of them touch my hair and weep. I remind them of their daughters. Others are troublesome, and these I am encouraged to stand before and strike with a wooden wand, cut to my hand, until the nurses laugh and say they never saw anything so droll.</div>

<div class="line_en">So we believe, at nine and ten. Some time in my eleventh year, I am summoned to the nurses' parlour by the matron of the house. I imagine she means to make me some treat. I am wrong. Instead, she greets me strangely, and will not meet my eye. There is a person with her -- a gentleman, she says -- but then, the word means little to me. It will mean more, in time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我九、十岁的年纪，护士们和我都坚信这一点。十一岁时的某天，我被护士长叫到办公室。我以为她要给我开小灶。我想错了。她没给我开小灶，而是不同寻常地问候我，却并不看我的眼睛。她旁边还有个人——她说是一位绅士——不过当时，这个词语对我来说无关紧要。很快，这个词对我就意味深长了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus I learn the rudiments of discipline and order; and incidentally apprehend the attitudes of insanity. This will all prove useful, later. When I am old enough to reason I am given a gold ring said to be my father's, the portrait of a lady called my mother, and understand I am an orphan; but, never having known a parent's love -- or rather, having known the favours of a score of mothers -- I am not greatly troubled by the news. I think the nurses clothe and feed me, for my own sake. I am a plain-faced child but, in that childless world, pass for a beauty. I have a sweet singing voice and an eye for letters. I suppose I shall live out all my days a nurse, contentedly teasing lunatics until I die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由此，我学到纪律和秩序的雏形，顺理成章地，我领会到对待疯子的态度。这些都很有用，后来都用上了。等我年岁成长，心智渐开，她们给我一个金质项圈，据说是我父亲的，里面有我母亲的小画像，于是我明白了，我是个孤儿；不过，从未领略过双亲挚爱——又或许，是从众位母亲身上领略到太多宠溺——我并未因此感到烦恼困惑。我想护士们供我穿衣吃饭，就是出于喜爱我。我是个相貌平常的孩子，然而，在那个没有儿童的世界里，我被当成个小美人。我有歌声般甜美的声音，还有一双能识文断字的眼睛。我曾以为，我要一辈子做护士，安心情愿地戏弄着那些疯子，以此终老。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Step closer," the matron says. The gentleman watches. He wears a suit of black, and a pair of black silk gloves. He holds a cane with an ivory knob, upon which he leans, the better to study me. His hair is black tending to white, his cheek cadaverous, his eyes imperfectly hidden by a pair of coloured glasses. An ordinary child might shrink from gazing at him; but I know nothing of ordinary children, and am afraid of no-one. I walk until I stand before him. He parts his lips, to pass his tongue across them. His tongue is dark at the tip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走近点，”护士长说道。绅士在一旁看着。他穿黑色套装，戴一双黑色丝手套，手持一根象牙把手的手杖，人斜斜地支在手杖上。他头发黑白相杂，面颊苍白，双眼完全隐没在一副墨水镜后面。普通人家的小孩见到他，难免心生畏惧，可我不是普通人家的小孩，我无所畏惧。我径直走到他面前，他张开嘴，舌头舔了一下嘴唇，他舌头尖上是黑的。">查看中文翻译</div>

She brings me boots, wool gloves, a gown of buff -- a hateful, girlish gown, cut to the calf, and stiffened from the shoulder to the waist with ribs of bone. She pulls the laces tight and, at my complaints, pulls them tighter. The nurses watch her, sighing. When it comes time for her to take me, they kiss me and hide their eyes. Then one of them quickly puts a pair of scissors to my head, to take a curl of hair to keep inside a locket; and, the others seeing her do that, they seize the shears from her, or take up knives and scissors of their own, and pluck and grasp at me until my hair tears at the root.

She rolls two of the eggs across her skirt, to break their shells. The flesh inside is grey, the yolk as dry as powder. I will remember the scent of it. The third egg she places on my lap. I will not eat it, but let it jerk there until it falls upon the carriage floor and is spoiled. "Tut tut," she says at that. She takes out her knitting, then her head droops and she sleeps.

He makes a loop of it, seeming to weigh it; then he brings it smartly down upon my dimpling knuckles. Then, with Mrs Stiles's assistance, he takes my other hand and does the same to that. The beads sting like a whip; but the silk keeps the flesh from breaking. At the first blow I yelp, like a dog -- in pain, in rage and sheer astonishment.

<div class="line_en">Indeed, no sooner has this idea risen in me, than I begin to hear the smothered sounds of movement, close by -- unnaturally close, they seem to me to be: I imagine a thousand skulking figures with their faces at the curtain, a thousand searching hands. I begin to cry. The corset I wear makes the tears come strangely. I long to lie still, so the lurking women shall not guess that I am there; but the stiller I try to be, the more wretched I grow. Presently, a spider or a moth brushing my cheek, I imagine the throttling hand has come at last, and jerk in a convulsion and, I suppose, shriek.</div>

<div class="line_en">I think it a terrible thing to do to a child; I think it terrible, even now. I lie, in an agony of misery and fear, straining my ears against the silence -- wide awake, sick, hungry, cold, alone, in a dark so deep the shifting black of my own eye-lids seems the brighter. My corset holds me like a fist. My knuckles, tugged into their stiff skin gloves, are starting out in bruises. Now and then the great clock shifts its gears, and chimes; and I draw what comfort I can from my idea that somewhere in the house walk lunatics, and with them watchful nurses. Then I begin to wonder over the habits of the place. Perhaps here they give their lunatics licence to wander; perhaps a madwoman will come to my room, mistaking it for another? Perhaps the wicked-tempered girl that sleeps next door is herself demented, and will come and throttle me with her hard hand!</div>

One time -- having overturned a candle and let the flame lap at the fringes of a chair until they smoke -- I am taken by Mr Way into the park and carried, along a lonely path, to the ice-house. I don't remember, now, the chill of the place; I remember the blocks of grey ice -- I should have supposed them clear, like crystal -- that tick in the wintry silence, like so many clocks. They tick for three hours. When Mrs Stiles comes to release me I have made myself a kind of nest and cannot be uncurled, and am as weak as if they had drugged me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have seen lunatics labour at endless tasks -- conveying sand from one leaking cup into another; counting the stitches in a fraying gown, or the motes in a sunbeam; filling invisible ledgers with the resulting sums. Had they been gentlemen, and rich -- instead of women -- then perhaps they would have passed as scholars and commanded staffs. -- I cannot say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我曾见过疯子无休止地劳作——把沙子从一个漏杯子里倒到另一个漏杯子里；数旧袍子上的针脚，或者数光线里的尘埃；把算出来的总数填写到子虚乌有的帐本里。如果他们是绅士，是有钱人——而不是女人——那么或许他们会做学者，或手握重权的人。——我也说不清。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That is the first day, perhaps, of my education. But next day, at eight, begin my lessons proper. I never have a governess: my uncle tutors me himself, having Mr Way set a desk and a stool for me close to the pointing finger on his library floor. The stool is high: my legs swing from it and the weight of my shoes makes them tingle and finally grow numb. Should I fidget, however -- should I cough, or sneeze -- then my uncle will come and snap at my fingers with the rope of silkcovered beads. His patience has curious lapses, after all; and though he claims to be free of a desire to harm me, he harms me pretty often. Still, the library is kept warmer than my own room, to ward off mould from the books; and I find I prefer to write, than to sew. He gives me a pencil with a soft lead that moves silently upon paper, and a green-shaded reading-lamp, to save my eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许，那正是我受教的第一天。而次日夜里，我的功课就正式开始了。我没有女家庭教师：舅舅亲自指导我，他命魏先生在他书房靠近那个手指的地方，为我放置了一套桌椅。椅子太高了：我腿挂在上面，沉重的靴子令我的脚麻木难当，最后完全失去知觉。然而，如果我坐立不安，如果我咳嗽或是打喷嚏，我舅舅就会过来，用那串包着丝线的珠子抽我的手。他的耐性终于消失得无影无踪；尽管他一再声称，并无意伤害我，他还是经常打我。还好，书房比我自己的房间暖和，这是为了防止灰尘落到藏书上；我发觉相比做针线，我更喜欢写字。他给我一支写起来悄无声息的软芯铅笔，还有一盏绿灯罩台灯，那是为了保护我的视力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I call them lessons; but I am not taught as other girls are. I learn to recite, softly and clearly; I am never taught to sing. I never learn the names of flowers and birds, but am schooled instead in the hides with which books are bound -- as say, morocco, russia, calf, chagrin; and their papers -- Dutch, China, motley, silk. I learn inks; the cutting of pens; the uses of pounce; the styles and sizes of founts: sans-serif, antique, Egyptian, pica, brevier, emerald, ruby, pearl… They are named for jewels. It is a cheat. For they are hard and dull as cinders in a grate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lamp smells, as it heats, of smouldering dust: a curious smell -- I shall grow to hate it! -- the smell of the parching of my own youth. My work itself is of the most tedious kind, and consists chiefly of copying pages of text, from antique volumes, into a leather-bound book. The book is a slim one, and when it is filled my job is to render it blank again with a piece of india-rubber. I remember this task, more than I remember the pieces of matter I am made to copy: for the pages, from endless friction, grow smudged and fragile and liable to tear; and the sight of a smudge on a leaf of text, or the sound of tearing paper, is more than my uncle, in his delicacy, can bear. They say children, as a rule, fear the ghosts of the dead; what I fear most as a child are the spectres of past lessons, imperfectly erased.</div>

I am allowed to take my supper in the dining-room, at one end of a great oak table, set with silver. My uncle sits at the other end. He keeps a reading-easel beside his place, and speaks very seldom; but if I should be so unlucky as to let fall a fork, or to jar my knife against my plate, then he will raise his face and fix me with a damp and terrible eye.

I care most for the wine. I am served it in a crystal glass engraved with an M. The ring of silver that holds my napkin is marked a tarnished black with the same initial.

My obedience enrages her more than ever my passions did; and seeing that, I grow meeker, with a hard, artful meekness that, receiving the edge of her sorrow, keeps it sharp, that provokes her to the pinches -- they are profitless enough -- and to scolds, which pay more, as being revealing of her griefs. I take her often to the graves, and make certain to sigh, to the full strength of my lungs, over my mother's stone. In time -- so cunning am I! -- I find out the name of her dead daughter; then, the kitchen cat giving birth to a litter of kittens, I take one for a pet, and name it for her.

I do it that night, and the night which follows, and the night which follows that; at last, as a clock must tick to a regular beat, I find I must do it or lie fretful in my bed.

<div class="line_en">So he says to me, many times. I do not believe him. I am thirteen. The books fill me, at first, with a kind of horror: for it seems a frightful thing, that children, in becoming women and men, should do as they describe -- get lusts, grow secret limbs and cavities, be prone to fevers, to crises, seek nothing but the endless joining together of smarting flesh. I imagine my mouth, stopped up with kisses. I imagine the parting of my legs. I imagine myself fingered and pierced… I am thirteen, as I have said. The fear gives way to restlessness: I begin to lie each night at Barbara's side, wakeful while she sleeps on; one time I put back the blanket to study the curve of her breast. Then I take to watching her as she bathes and dresses. Her legs -- that I know from my uncle's books should be smooth -- are dark with hair; the place between them -- which I know should be neat, and fair -- darkest of all. That troubles me. Then at last, one day, she catches me gazing.</div>

Anyway, I have been too long at Briar, and draw a comfort, now, from regularity. I have grown used to my gloves and my hard-boned gowns, and flinch at the first unloosening of the strings.
