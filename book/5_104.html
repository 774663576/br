<div class="line_en">Kate pretended to focus all of her attention on driving Tully's car, but it wasn't easy. Ever since she'd picked her up from the interview, Tully hadn't stopped talking, spinning out the old little-girl dreams. We're on our way, Kate. As soon as I get an anchor spot, I'll make sure they hire you as a reporter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate knew she should put the brakes -- finally -- on this dual future of theirs. She was tired of following Tully, and besides, she didn't want to quit her job. She had a reason, finally, to stay where she was.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was ridiculous, and embarrassing, but her dreams centered more on him and less on broadcasting. Not that she could admit that to anyone. Twenty-five-year-old college-educated women were expected to dream of more money and higher positions on the corporate ladder and running the very companies that had refused to hire their mothers. Husbands were to be avoided in the pre-thirty years. There was always time for marriage and children; was the common refrain. You couldn't give up you for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然荒唐又可耻，但她梦想的重点在他身上，而不是传播，可是她无法对任何人坦承。二十五岁，拥有学士学位的女性应该要赚大钱，攀上企业阶级的顶端，管理当年拒绝雇用她们母亲的公司，尽可能避免在三十岁之前结婚。这个年纪的女性普遍认为婚姻与生育可以慢慢来，不该为了家庭放弃自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How pathetic was that? He didn't love her, but she couldn't help thinking that maybe with Tully gone, she'd have a chance.</div>

<div class="line_en">But what if you wanted them more than you wanted a singular, powerful you? No one ever talked about that. Kate knew that Tully would laugh at such thoughts, say Kate was stuck in the fifties. Even her mother would say she was wrong and bring up that weighted word: regret. She'd parrot the words that filled the pages of Ms. magazine -- that being just a mother was a waste of talent. Her mother wouldn't even notice how sad she looked as she spoke, as if the life she'd chosen had been for nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="万一有人想要家庭，而不是有权有势的自己，那又该怎么办呢？凯蒂知道塔莉一定会取笑她卡在50年代，就连妈妈也会说这样不对，然后搬出那个沉重的词：后悔。她会引用女性杂志上那些文章，教训她只当妈妈是浪费天分的行为。妈妈从来没察觉说这些话时她的表情多惆怅，仿佛她所选择的人生毫无意义。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么说不定你并不爱他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was the fundamental difference between them. Kate believed in love with all her heart; unfortunately, she'd fallen in love with a man who didn't know she existed. "What matters now is your career, anyway. There's always time for love and marriage."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully had forgotten how long and lonely a night could be. For so many years, Chad had been her protection, her port. With him, she'd learned to sleep through the night, breathing peacefully, dreaming only of her bright future, and because he'd loved her, she'd slept well in her own bed, too, on their nights apart, comforted by the knowledge that she could go to him anytime.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe she'd made a mistake. Maybe this emptiness she felt right now was love. With the life she'd led it made sense that she would notice the negative of an emotion rather than the positive. But if she did love him, what difference did it make? What would she do?

<div class="line_cn" title="说不定她做错了，也许她此刻感受到的空虚就是爱。她似乎只注意到负面情绪却感受不到正面，不过考虑到她过往的人生，这样或许一点也不奇怪。不过，就算她真的爱他，那又如何？她能怎么办？跟他去田纳西，住进大学教职员宿舍，成为怀利太太？这样她就无法成为下一个珍恩·艾诺森或杰西卡·塞维奇了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She got a big KVTS cup out of the cupboard and poured her tea, then went to the living room, where she sat on the couch, tucking her feet beneath her, warming her cold hands on the porcelain.

<div class="line_en">She glanced up and saw Kate, who stood in front of her bedroom door, wearing the same flannel nightgown she'd worn for years. Tully usually teased her that she looked like one of the Waltons, but tonight she appreciated the familiarity. It was funny how a single garment could remind you of years together -- slumber parties and makeovers and breakfasts spent watching Saturday morning cartoons. "I'm sorry if I woke you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate's face took on that sad, semi-judgmental look that Tully hated. It was almost a poor-Tully look. "I know about love," she said quietly. "Maybe not being in love or being loved, but I know about loving someone and how much it can hurt. I think if you really loved Chad, you'd know it, and you'd be in Tennessee right now. At least, if I loved someone, I'd know it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂的神情惆怅又略带批评，塔莉很讨厌那种表情，感觉很像在可怜她。“我懂爱，”她轻声说，“或许不是相爱或被爱的那种，但我知道爱人的感觉，也知道那有多痛。我认为如果你真的爱查德，那么你自然会知道，现在就会跟他一起在田纳西了。至少当我爱上一个人，我自己会知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The words should have comforted Tully; they were intended to be hopeful, she knew that, but just then, she couldn't feel that optimism. Rather, she felt colder and emptier having heard them from Kate. "There's something missing in me," she said quietly. "First my dad saw it. Whoever the hell he is; he must have taken one look at me and run. And let's not even discuss my loving mother. I'm… easy to leave. Why is that?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate scooted down the couch, leaned against Tully just the way they used to, all those years ago on the banks of the Pilchuck. The snack box poked into her back and she pulled it out from behind her and tossed it onto the messy, newspaper-strewn coffee table. "There's nothing missing in you, Tully. It's the opposite, in fact. You're more than most people. You are really, really special, and if Chad didn't see that -- or couldn't wait for you to be ready for him -- then he wasn't the guy for you. Maybe that's a normal problem when you're with an older guy. He's ready to land when you're just taking off."</div>
