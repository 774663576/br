<div class="line_en">Many years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand. He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want. To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan's Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.</div>

<div class="line_en">This Island is a very singular one. It consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three miles long. Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh-hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists of England. The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with its fragrance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座岛与众不同，几乎全由海沙堆成，长约三英里，宽里没超过两三百步。有条小得看不大清的海湾，横贯小岛和大陆之间，缓缓穿过一大片芦苇丛生的烂泥塘，水鸡就爱在那一带做窝。不难想象，岛上草木寥寥无几，就是有，也都长得矮小。参天高树根本就看不到。西端有座毛特烈堡，还有几间简陋木屋，每逢盛夏，便有人远避查尔斯顿城里的尘嚣和炎热，租了木屋住下。靠近两端，倒可以看到一簇簇棕榈，但除了这一角，和海边一溜坚硬的雪白沙滩，全岛密密麻麻的长满芬芳的桃金娘。英国园艺家异常珍视这种灌木，在当地往往长得高达十五英尺到二十英尺，连成树丛，密得简直插不下脚，散发出馥郁香味，到处弥漫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance. This soon ripened into friendship -- for there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem. I found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many books, but rarely employed them. His chief amusements were gunning and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest of shells or entomological specimens; -- his collection of the latter might have been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young "Massa Will." It is not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这片树丛深处，靠近小岛东端，比较偏僻的那一头，勒格朗盖了小小一间窝棚。当初我跟他萍水相逢，他就住在那里了。这个隐士身上有不少特点引人注意，令人敬佩，所以我们不久便成了朋友。我看出他富有教养，聪明过人，就是感染了愤世嫉俗的情绪，心里忽而热情洋溢，忽而郁郁寡欢，这种怪脾气动辄发作。他手边书籍倒有不少，就是难得翻阅。主要消遣只是钓鱼打猎，否则便顺着沙滩，穿过桃金娘丛，一路溜达，或者拾取贝壳，或者采集昆虫标本——他收藏的昆虫标本，连史磺麦台姆之流也不免眼红。每回出去走走，总随身带着一个名叫丘比特的老黑人。勒格朗家道败落前，丘比特就解放了，可他自以为理该寸步不离的侍侯“威儿小爷”，任凭威胁利诱，都打发他不走。想来是勒格朗的亲戚，认为这流浪汉有些精神失常，才想出办法让丘比特渐渐养成这种梗脾气，好监督他，保护他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18—, there occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks -- my residence being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the Island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of the present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth. It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在苏里文岛所在的纬度上，冬天难得冷到彻骨，秋季时节根本不必生火。可话又说回来，一八XX年十月中旬光景，有一日居然冷得出奇。太阳快下山，我一脚高一脚低的穿过常青灌木丛，朝我朋友那间窝棚走去。当时我住在查尔斯顿，离开苏里文岛有九英里路，来往交通工具又远不如日前这么方便，因此有好几个星期没去探望他了。我一到窝棚前，照例敲敲大门，竟不见有人应门，我知道钥匙藏在哪里，一找就找到了，打开门，直闯进去。只见壁炉里烈火熊熊。这可稀罕，倒也正中我下怀。我脱掉大衣，在一张扶手椅上坐下，靠近哔哔剥剥烧着的柴火，就此耐性等待两位主人回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome. Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits -- how else shall I term them? -- of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with Jupiter's assistance, a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天黑不久，他们回来了，亲热透顶的款待我。丘比特笑得嘴也合不拢，满屋乱转，杀水鸡做晚饭。勒格朗正好犯着热情洋溢的一种毛病——要不称做病，那叫什么好呢？他找到了一个不知名的新品种双壳贝，此外，追踪结果，仗着丘比特帮忙，还抓到一只金龟子，照他看，完全是新发现，不过他希望明天听听我怎么看法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, suppose it is, Jup," replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, "is that any reason for your letting the birds burn? The color" -- here he turned to me -- "is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea. You never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit -- but of this you cannot judge till to-morrow. In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape." Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“得，就算是吧，丘，”勒格朗答道，照我看，他其实不必说得那么认真，“难道你这就可以听凭水鸡烧糊？那身颜色……”这时他回头对我说话了——“说实在的，你看了真会同意丘比特那套想法。甲壳上一层锃亮金光，你长了眼睛也没见过——到明天，你自己看吧。暂且我倒可以把大概样子告诉你。”说着就在一张小桌边坐下，桌上放着笔墨，就是没纸。他在抽屉里找了找，可一张也没找到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nonsense! no! -- the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color -- about the size of a large hickory-nut -- with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The antennæ are --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, if I had only known you were here!" said Legrand, "but it's so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others? As I was coming home I met Lieutenant G --, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to see it until the morning. Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in creation!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早知道你来就好了！”勒格朗说，“可有好久没见到你了，我怎么料得到你偏偏今晚来看我呢？刚才回家来，路上碰到毛特烈堡的葛XX中尉，一时糊涂，竟把虫子借给他了，因此得到明天早晨，你才看得到。在这儿过夜吧，等明天太阳一出，我就打发丘去取回来。真是美妙极了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Never mind," said he at length, "this will answer;" and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen. While he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising. As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“算了，”临了他说，“这就行。”说着从坎肩袋里掏出一小片东西，我还当是龌里龌龊的书写纸呢。他就拿笔在上面画起草图来。他画他的，我还觉得冷，照旧坐在炉火边。他画完，也没欠身，便把画递给我。我刚接到手，突然传来一阵汪汪吠叫，紧接着又响起嚓嚓抓门声。丘比特打开门，只见勒格朗那条纽芬兰大狗冲了进来，扑到我肩头，跟我百般亲热，因为以往我来做客，对它总是非常关怀。转眼间它不再欢蹦乱跳，我就朝纸上看看，说实话，我朋友究竟画的是什么，真叫人摸不着头脑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well!" I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, "this is a strange scarabæus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it before -- unless it was a skull, or a death's-head -- which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃！”我默默地打量了一会道，“我不得不实说，这是只希奇的金龟子，真新鲜，这种东西压根就没见过——要末算是头颅骨，或者说骷髅头，在我眼里，再也没有比这更象骷髅头的了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps so," said I; "but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its personal appearance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许是吧，”我说，“可话又说回来，勒格朗，你恐怕画不来画。我得亲眼看见了才能知道这甲虫是什么模样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A death's-head!" echoed Legrand --"Oh -- yes -- well, it has something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black spots look like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth -- and then the shape of the whole is oval."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“骷髅头！”勒格朗照说了一遍。”嗯——对——不用说，画在纸上，准有几分相仿，顶上两个黑点好比眼睛，呃？底下那个长点就象嘴——再说整个样子又是鹅蛋形的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, my dear fellow, you are joking then," said I, "this is a very passable skull -- indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull, according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology -- and your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint. I presume you will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis, or something of that kind -- there are many similar titles in the Natural Histories. But where are the antennæ you spoke of?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，老兄，你在开玩笑罗，”我说，“这实在称得上头颅骨——照一般人对这种生理学标本的看法，我倒不妨说，这是个顶呱呱的头颅骨——你那只金龟子要是象头颅骨的话，管保是人间少见的怪虫。嘿，凭这点意思，倒可以兴出种恐怖透顶的迷信。我看你不妨取个名，叫做人头金龟子，或者诸如此类的名称——博物学上有不少类似的名称呢。话再说回来，你谈到的触须在哪儿呀？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant his face grew violently red -- in another as excessively pale. For some minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any comment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked. He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted. As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他火冒三丈的接了纸，正想揉成一团，分明打算扔进火里，无意中朝那图样瞅了一眼，仿佛猛然全神贯注在上面了。脸色一阵红，一阵白。坐在椅上，仔细端详了好久，才站起身，从桌上取了支蜡烛，走到屋子远头一角，在只大箱子沙锅内坐下，又心痒难抓的把纸打量了一通，翻来倒去的看，却是一言不发。他这副举止真叫人大吃一惊；不过看来还是小心为妙，最好别说什么，免得火上加油。不久，他从衣袋里掏出皮夹，小心翼翼的把纸夹好，再放进写字台，上了锁。这时他才镇静下来，可原先那副热情洋溢的神气竟一扫而空了。看他模样，要说是愁眉苦脸，还不如说茫然若失。夜色愈来愈浓，他神志愈来愈恍惚，想得出了神，不管我说什么俏皮话，都逗不起他劲头。我从前常在他家里过夜，这回本也打算住一宿，可眼见主人这般心情，就觉得还是走的好。他没硬留，但我临走，竟亲热逾常的握了握我的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, well," I said, "perhaps you have -- still I don't see them;" and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his ill humor puzzled me -- and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there were positively no antennæ visible, and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death's-head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“得，得，得，”我说，“也许你是画得够清楚了——可我还是没看见。”我不想惹他发火，没再讲什么，就把纸递给了他；不过，事情闹得这么尴尬，倒万万没想到；他为什么不痛快，我也摸不着头脑——就甲虫图来说，上面的确没画着什么触须，整个形状也真跟平常的骷髅头一模一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was a beautiful scarabæus, and, at that time, unknown to naturalists -- of course a great prize in a scientific point of view. There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand's agreement with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four o'clock -- Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself. Jupiter had with him the scythe and spades -- the whole of which he insisted upon carrying -- more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or complaisance. His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and "dat d -- d bug" were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. For my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented himself with the scarabæus, which he carried attached to the end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a conjuror, as he went. When I observed this last, plain evidence of my friend's aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. I thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success. In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition. Having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than "we shall see!"</div>

When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At length he approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,</div>

<div class="line_en">In youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipferum, the most magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished. The risk of the achievement was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground.</div>

Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro's disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus, or, perhaps, by Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to be "a bug of real gold."</div>

We had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor. In the mean time I made no remark. Jupiter, at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. This done, and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home.</div>

<div class="line_en">At a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.</div>

<div class="line_en">We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more intense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process -- perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury. This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of trellis-work over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron -- six in all -- by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons. Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight. Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. These we drew back -- trembling and panting with anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, a glow and a glare that absolutely dazzled our eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed. Amazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter's countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume. He seemed stupified -- thunderstricken. Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy,</div>

<div class="line_en">It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late, and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed before daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done; and much time was spent in deliberation -- so confused were the ideas of all. We, finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return. We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive toil, at one o'clock in the morning. Worn out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more just then. We rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the premises. A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of our treasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这早晚，我们累垮了；可当时兴奋过度，反而睡不好。辗转不安的睡了三四个钟头，大家象事先商定似的，一齐起身，检点金银财宝了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. There had been nothing like order or arrangement. Every thing had been heaped in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of silver. All was gold of antique date and of great variety -- French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. There was no American money. The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating. There were diamonds -- some of them exceedingly large and fine -- a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy; -- three hundred and ten emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent identification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments; -- nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings; -- rich chains -- thirty of these, if I remember; -- eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes; -- five gold censers of great value; -- a prodigious golden punch-bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars, if one. Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion -- but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and, upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the treasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那笔财宝竟有满满一箱，我们花了整整一天，又干了大半个晚上，才检查完毕。一箱财宝放得不整不齐，也不分门别类，全都乱糟糟堆着。我们仔细的分了类，才晓得手边的财富，比开头想象的还要多。硬币方面，按照当时兑换的牌价，尽可能准确的估计了一下，其价值总共值四十五万多块钱。没一块是银币。统统全是金币，五花八门的，法国、西班牙、德国的都有，还有几个英国见尼①，此外还有一些压根没见过的膺币。有几个重甸甸的大硬币，差不多磨光了，花纹根本看不清。美国货币却一块也没有。珠宝的价值更难估计。其中有钻石——有些大得很，亮极了——总共一百一十颗，没一颗不大；十八块灿烂夺目的红宝石；三百一十块翡翠，全很美；还有二十一块蓝宝石，外加一颗猫儿眼。镶嵌托子全拆掉了，宝石都乱七八糟的扔在箱子里。一我们在其他金器中检出那些托子，看来个个都给锤子砸扁，好象是免得给人认出。此外还有无数纯金首饰：将近两百只又厚又重的指环和耳环；昂贵的金链——我要没记错的话，总共有三十根；八十三个又大又沉的十字架；五只价值连城的金香炉；五只偌大的金质五味酒钵，精工雕着葡萄叶和酒仙像；还有两把细工镂刻的剑柄，以及好些小物件，我可记不起来了。这种种贵重物品共重三百五十多常衡磅②。我可没把一百九十七只上等金表算在这里头；其中三只，每只足足值五百块钱；好多都是老古董，算做时计，可不值一个子儿；零件多少有点锈坏了，但都镶满珠宝，配着高价的金壳。当天晚上，我们估计那箱宝贝共值一百五十万；等到后来将珠宝首饰卖掉（有几件没卖，留着自用），才晓得价值估得实在太低了。【注：①英国一六六三年至一八一三年发行的金币名。一七一七年。其价值定为二十一先令。②常衡量一般衡量米、炭等粗重物品；至于量金银珠宝则用金衡量。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand, who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们终于查点完毕，兴奋异常的心情消褪了几分，勒格朗看我沉不住气的急着想知道这离奇古怪的哑谜谜底，就把一本细帐原原本本的谈了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment. It was quite dirty, you remember. Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my design was very different in detail from this -- although there was a certain similarity in general outline. Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline -- at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus, and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time. This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind struggles to establish a connexion -- a sequence of cause and effect -- and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence. I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing on the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabæus. I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration. I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不；看看很象纸，我开头也当是纸，可在上面一画，就看出原来是张极薄的羊皮。那张羊皮脏得很，你总记得吧。回过头来说，我正要揉成一团，无意中朝你看过的草图溜了一眼，这一看，就不必提有多惊奇了，说来不信，我自以为那儿画着甲虫图，谁知竞瞅见了骷髅头像。我一时吓呆了，怎么也没法有条有理的开动脑筋。我知道自己画的，跟这骷髅头绝不相同——虽然大体轮廓有几分相仿。我马上拿了根蜡烛，坐到屋子另一头，更仔细的朝羊皮上打量了一通。翻过羊皮，就看到自己画的那张画还是老样子。一开头心里只觉得奇怪，外形轮廓居然不差分毫——怎么原先竟不知道有这等异常的巧合，羊皮一面画着个头颅骨，背后怕正是我那张金龟子图，而且这头颅骨的轮廓和大小，全跟我画的一模一样。我刚才说，碰到这等异常的巧合，我一时楞住了。人家碰到这种巧合，通常总要出神。心里挤命想理出个头绪——前因后果的关系——可就是办不到，一时麻痹了。等到我清醒过来，才渐渐明白，不由吓了一跳，连那种巧合也没那么叫我吃惊。我清清楚楚、明明白白的记起来了，当时画金龟子草图，羊皮上可没什么画。绝对没有；我记得当初想找个最最干净的地方，正反两面都先后翻过。要是画着头颅骨，当然不会看不到。这真是个谜，只觉得无从解释；不过，就连在开头一刹那间，我心灵深处已经隐隐掠过阵念头，好象萤火虫一闪，经过昨夜那番奇遇，真相终于大白。我当下站起身，把羊皮藏好，等你们全走了，再去思索。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You remember;" said he, "the night when I handed you the rough sketch I had made of the scarabæus. You recollect also, that I became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death's-head. When you first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact. Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me -- for I am considered a good artist -- and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire."</div>

<div class="line_en">"When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession. The spot where we discovered the scarabæus was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short distance above high water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. It was lying half buried in the sand, a corner sticking up. Near the spot where we found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship's long boat. The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等你走了，丘比特睡着了，我就把这事更有条理的研究了一番。首先琢磨的是羊皮怎么落到我手里。我们发现金龟子的地点，就在大陆岸，小岛东面里把路远。靠近满潮标高头。我刚抓住甲虫，就给狠狠咬了一口，不由马上扔了。丘比特为人一向谨慎，眼看虫向他飞去，先在四下找寻叶子什么的，好拿来抓虫。在这一刹那间，我跟他全一下子瞅见了羊皮，当时我还当是纸呢。羊皮半埋在沙里，一角翘起，就在找到羊皮的附近，我看到一堆破船，模样好象长舢板。看光景堆在那儿有好久好久了；因为船骨样子简直看不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and gave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met Lieutenant G --. I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him take it to the fort. On my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection. Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once -- you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History. At the same time, without being conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“回过头来说，丘比特捡起羊皮，把甲虫包在里头，交给我。不久我们就打道回府，路上碰到葛xx中尉。我拿虫子给他看看，他请求我让他带到堡里去。我刚答应，他就将虫子塞进坎肩袋里，外面可没包羊皮，他打量甲虫那当儿，羊皮一直捏在我手里。大概他生怕我改变主意，认为最好马上把这个意外收获拿到手吧——你知道，他对一切跟博物学有关的东西才迷呢。就在那时，我准是不知不觉拿羊皮放进口袋里了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. Parchment is durable -- almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This reflection suggested some meaning -- some relevancy -- in the death's-head. I did not fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment. Although one of its corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen for a memorandum -- for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No doubt you will think me fanciful -- but I had already established a kind of connexion. I had put together two links of a great chain. There was a boat lying on a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a parchment -- not a paper -- with a skull depicted on it. You will, of course, ask 'where is the connexion?' I reply that the skull, or death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the death's-head is hoisted in all engagements.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But," I interposed, "you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle. How then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull -- since this latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about the period in question. The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing on the hearth. I was heated with exercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close to the chimney. Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire. At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its examination. When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light, on the parchment, the skull which I saw designed on it. You are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write on either paper or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a green tint results. The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre, gives a red. These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written on cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application of heat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想到这地步，就拚命回想当时发生的一切小事，果然一清二楚的回想起来了。当时天气很冷（啊，这真是难得的巧事！），壁炉里生着火。我走得热了，坐在桌边。可你呢，拖了张椅子挨着炉边坐着。我正把羊皮交到你手里，你刚打算看，那条狗‘胡尔夫’进来了，扑到你肩上。你左手抚摸它，撵它跑，右手捏着羊皮，懒懒的垂在两膝间，恰恰靠近炉火。我一时还当火苗烧着了纸，正想叫你，谁知还没开口你已经拿开了，正忙着看画呢。我一想到这些详细经过，顿时肯定，我看见羊皮上画着的头颅骨，就是热力显现出来的。你也晓得自古以来有种化药剂，可以用来写在纸上或皮纸上，只有给火一烤，字迹才会显出。人家常拿不纯的氧化钴溶在王水里，再加四倍水稀释；结果就调出绿色溶液。含杂质的钴溶解在纯硝酸里，就调出红色溶液。写在纸上的药剂冷却以后，经过相当一段时期，长短可没准，颜色就褪了，不过再加热，又一清二楚了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were sure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example, thus: When I drew the scarabæus, there was no skull apparent on the parchment. When I had completed the drawing, I gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it. You, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was not done by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，怪就怪在这里；不过，我当时倒没动什么脑筋，就把这一谜底解决了。我步步踏实，因此答案只有一个。比方说，我是这样推论的：我画金龟子那当儿，羊皮上明明没头颅骨。等画好，交给你，一直眼睁睁看着你，直看到你把画还给我。因此头颅骨不是你画的，当时也没别人画。那就不是人力所为了。话可说回来，画总是画上去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was clear that the action of the caloric had been imperfect or unequal. I immediately kindled a fire, and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At first, the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull; but, on persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the death's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to be a goat.

<div class="line_en">"Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current -- the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere on the Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates. These rumors must have had some foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long and so continuously, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed. Had Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form. You will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers, not about money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident -- say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality -- had deprived him of the means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his followers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided attempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to the reports which are now so common.

In general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution, until the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us, all difficulty is removed by the signature. The pun on the word 'Kidd' is appreciable in no other language than the English.

Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object, would be nearly certain to overdo the matter. When, in the course of his composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this place, more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding. Acting on this hint, I made the division thus: 'A good glass in the Bishop's hostel in the Devil's seat -- twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes -- northeast and by north -- main branch seventh limb east side -- shoot from the left eye of the death's-head -- a bee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.'"</div>

Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into my head, quite suddenly, that this 'Bishop's Hostel' might have some reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four miles to the northward of the Island. I accordingly went over to the plantation, and re-instituted my inquiries among the older negroes of the place. At length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as Bessop's Castle, and thought that she could guide me to it, but that it was not a castle, nor a tavern, but a high rock.</div>

This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it, gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our ancestors. I made no doubt that here was the 'devil's seat' alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我正忙着动脑筋，突然瞅见岩壁东面伸出窄窄一道岩檐，大约在我站着的岩顶下面一码地方；约莫突出十八英寸光景，最多只有一英尺宽，就在岩檐上面的悬崖中有个壁龛，看上去跟老辈人使用的一种凹背椅相差不多。我就肯定那儿正是原稿上提到的‘魔椅’，哑谜的全部谜底也就解了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, "twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes,' and 'northeast and by north,' were intended as directions for the levelling of the glass.

I proceeded to use the glass. Of course, the 'twenty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by north.' This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of twenty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance. In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was. Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull.</div>

<div class="line_en">"On this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved; for the phrase 'main branch, seventh limb, east side,' could refer only to the position of the skull on the tree, while'shoot from the left eye of the death's head' admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure. I perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot,' (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite point -- and beneath this point I thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“发现了这个人头骨，我顿时大为乐观，自信谜语解开了；因为‘最大树枝，第七根桠枝东面’那一句，只能指头颅骨在树上的地位，至于‘从骷髅头左眼射击’那句话，也只有一种解释，正是找寻宝藏的办法。我看出方法就是从头颅骨的左眼射下一颗子弹，从树身最近一点划出一条直距线，换句话说，就是直线，穿过‘子弹’，或者说子弹落下的地方，再延伸五十英尺，就会指出一定地方——我看，地下至少可能藏着一笔财宝。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“也许是这样；但我还是忍不住想，常识和诗意的一致性同样与这件事有关要从魔鬼的座位上看得见，这个物体，如果很小，就必须是白色的；而且没有什么东西能像你的人类头骨那样，在暴露于各种天气的情况下，保持甚至增加它的白色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me. What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification. For this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall from the tree. An observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊哈，说老实话，当时瞧你分明疑心我脑子不对头，多少有点生气，就打定主意弄点玄虚，随意暗中罚你。因此故意挥舞甲虫，因此故意从树上吊下甲虫。听到你讲甲虫重得很，我才有了吊下甲虫的念头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle -- how excessively odd! I was sure you were mad. And why did you insist on letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可你当初大吹法螺，还有你那样挥舞甲虫——有多古怪呵！当时我想你准疯了。你何不从头颅骨中吊下子弹，干吗偏要吊下虫子呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself. There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them -- and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply. It is clear that Kidd -- if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I doubt not -- it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor. But, the worst of this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret. Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen -- who shall tell?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这问题，我也跟你一样无从解释。但仿佛只有一个说法讲得通——要是认为我看法里指的暴行真有其事，那真可怕。事情很明白，基德——如果真是基德埋藏这笔财宝的话，这点我可深信不疑——事情很明白，他准有帮手帮他埋。等埋好了。他或许认为最好把参加埋的人全都干掉。说不定，他趁助手在坑里忙着，用锄头把他们砸两下就完事了；说不定要砸十来下——谁说得上？”">查看中文翻译</div>
