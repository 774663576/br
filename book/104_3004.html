<div class="line_en">The door of the lighted bathroom stood ajar; in addition to that, a skeleton glow came through the Venetian blind from the outside arclights; these intercrossed rays penetrated the darkness of the bedroom and revealed the following situation.</div>

<div class="line_en">I seemed to have shed my clothes and slipped into pajamas with the kind of fantastic instantaneousness which is implied when in a cinematographic scene the process of changing is cut; and I had already placed my knee on the edge of the bed when Lolita turned her head and stared at me through the striped shadows.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clothed in one of her old nightgowns, my Lolita lay on her side with her back to me, in the middle of the bed. Her lightly veiled body and bare limbs formed a Z. She had put both pillows under her dark tousled head; a band of pale light crossed her top vertebrae.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿着一件她过去的睡衣，我的洛丽塔侧身躺着，背对着我。躺在床中央。她稍稍盖住的身体和裸露的四肢呈“ Z” 形。她把两只枕头都放在她黑发蓬乱的头下；一束惨淡的光横在她的脊柱上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now this was something the intruder had not expected. The whole pill-spiel (a rather sordid affair, entre nous soit dit) had had for object a fastness of sleep that a whole regiment would not have disturbed, and here she was staring at me, and thickly calling me "Barbara." Barbara, wearing my pajamas which were much too tight for her, remained poised motionless over the little sleep-talker. Softly, with a hopeless sigh, Dolly turned away, resuming her initial position. For at least two minutes I waited and strained on the brink, like that tailor with his homemade parachute forty years ago when about to jump from the Eiffel Tower. Her faint breathing had the rhythm of sleep. Finally I heaved myself onto my narrow margin of bed, stealthily pulled at the odds and ends of sheets piled up to the south of my stone-cold heels -- and Lolita lifted her head and gaped at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这却是出乎这个强人预料的。整个药片演说（是件非常卑鄙的任务，我们悄悄谈吧）已经使听者有了个沉沉的睡眠，纵使人声鼎沸也不会把它打搅。但这会儿，她却凝望着我，重重地叫着我“巴巴拉”。巴巴拉穿着紧绷绷的睡衣，仍然保持自若，一动未动，面对着这个小梦话家。轻轻地，随着一声无望的叹息，洛丽塔又转过身去，还原她先前的姿势。至少有两分钟，我等待着，屏息在床缘，就象四十年前那位穿着自制降落伞准备从埃菲尔铁塔上跳下去的裁缝的心情。她微弱的呼吸发出均匀的睡眠韵声。最后，我终于强自移到床的一窄条上，悄悄拽过堆在我石头一样冰凉的脚跟处的一点床单—洛丽塔抬起头，看着我，张大了嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I learned later from a helpful pharmaceutist, the purple pill did not even belong to the big and noble family of barbiturates, and though it might have induced sleep in a neurotic who believed it to be a potent drug, it was too mild a sedative to affect for any length of time a wary, albeit weary, nymphet. Whether the Ramsdale doctor was a charlatan or a shrewd old rogue, does not, and did not, really matter. What mattered, was that I had been deceived. When Lolita opened her eyes again, I realized that whether or not the drug might work later in the night, the security I had relied upon was a sham one. Slowly her head turned away and dropped onto her unfair amount of pillow. I lay quite still on my brink, peering at her rumpled hair, at the glimmer of nymphet flesh, where half a haunch and half a shoulder dimly showed, and trying to gauge the depth of her sleep by the rate of her respiration. Some time passed, nothing changed, and I decided I might risk getting a little closer to that lovely and maddening glimmer; but hardly had I moved into its warm purlieus than her breathing was suspended, and I had the odious feeling that little Dolores was wide awake and would explode in screams if I touched her with any part of my wretchedness. Please, reader: no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted, morbidly sensitive, infinitely circumspect hero of my book, do not skip these essential pages! Imagine me; I shall not exist if you do not imagine me; try to discern the doe in me, trembling in the forest of my own iniquity; let's even smile a little. After all, there is no harm in smiling. For instance (I almost wrote "frinstance"), I had no place to rest my head, and a fit of heartburn (they call those fries "French," grand Dieu!) was added to my discomfort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我后来从一位帮了我很多忙的药剂师那儿得知，紫色药片甚至连那个庞大、神圣的巴比妥盐酸家族都不属于，尽管它能让一个相信它是效力极大的麻醉药的精神病患者入睡，却还只是太温和的镇定剂，不能在任意长时间里对虽然脆弱但机敏异常的性感少女发生作用。拉姆斯代尔医生是否是个庸医，还是一个精明的老骗子，现在、过去都无关紧要。要紧的是，我受了骗。当洛丽塔再次睁开眼睛的时，我发觉不论那药物在后半夜是否还会起作用，我所依赖的只是一件赝品。她的头又缓缓转过去，落入她独占的枕头里。我呆呆地躺在我的边沿上，偷眼看她散乱的头发，看她性感少女光滑的肌肤，她腰的一半和肩膀的一半露在外面，我还想通过她喘息的频律估量她睡意的深度。过了好一会儿，没有任何变化，我决意冒险朝那片可爱、今人发狂的光泽靠近；但不等我挪进它温暖的外缘，她的呼吸就停止了。我有种讨厌的感觉，小多洛雷斯早就大醒，只要我用我任何卑劣的部位触到她，她立即就会放声厉叫。请求你们，读者：不管你们对我书中这个温柔、过于敏感、无比谨惧的主人公多么愤怒，还是不要漏掉这重要的几页吧！想想我；如果你们不想，我就不会存在；试着辨识我心中的雌鹿，它在我自己邪恶的森林中战栗；甚至还让我们笑笑吧。毕竟笑是不至于伤害的。比如说（我几乎写错这几个字），我没地方放我的头，还有一点儿胃灼热对我的不适火上浇油（他们管这些油炸食物叫“法国菜”，上帝啊！）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There is nothing louder than an American hotel; and, mind you, this was supposed to be a quiet, cozy, old-fashioned, homey place --"gracious living" and all that stuff. The clatter of the elevator's gate -- some twenty yards northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside my left temple -- alternated with the banging and booming of the machine's various evolutions and lasted well beyond midnight. Every now and then, immediately east of my left ear (always assuming I lay on my back, not daring to direct my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bed-mate), the corridor would brim with cheerful, resonant and inept exclamations ending in a volley of good-nights. When that stopped, a toilet immediately north of my cerebellum took over. It was a manly, energetic, deep-throated toilet, and it was used many times. Its gurgle and gush and long afterflow shook the wall behind me. Then someone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick, almost coughing out his life with his liquor, and his toilet descended like a veritable Niagara, immediately beyond our bathroom. And when finally all the waterfalls had stopped, and the enchanted hunters were sound asleep, the avenue under the window of my insomnia, to the west of my wake -- a staid, eminently residential, dignified alley of huge trees -- degenerated into the despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有比美国旅店更嘈闹的了；我得提醒你们这儿却被认为是一个静谧、安逸、旧式、如家一样的地方—“舒适的生活”，诸如此类。电梯门呵啷啷地响—距我的头东北二十码以外，但听起来那么清晰，就象在我左边太阳穴里—伴随着机器各种上下的轰响声和嗡嗡声，一直持续到子夜。偶尔，就在我左耳的正东边（假定我总是平躺着，不敢将自己卑劣的肋部朝向我床伴儿模糊的臀部），走廊充溢着快乐、愚蠢带回音的感叹话，以及结束时的一连串“晚安”。当那停止以后，我小脑正北方的一只抽水马桶又取而代之。那是只’男性的、精力旺盛的、吼声深沉的马桶，使用频繁。它的咯咯声、倾泻声和长时间的尾流震动了我脑后的墙壁。南边什么人又病得厉害，随着他咳出的液汁几乎把命也咳了出来，他的马桶象真正尼加拉瓜大瀑布，与我们的紧紧毗连。等所有的瀑布静止了以后，当一切着魔的猎人都沉沉睡去，在我醒着的西边，在我失眠窗下的大街，—满是参天大树的一条沉寂、醒目、庄严的宅区小径—衰落成巨型卡车经常出没的污涂地，其呼啸声横穿过濡湿、轻风席席的夜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was again fast asleep, my nymphet, but still I did not dare to launch upon my enchanted voyage. La Petite Dormeuse ou l'Amant Ridicule. Tomorrow I would stuff her with those earlier pills that had so thoroughly numbed her mummy. In the glove compartment -- or in the Gladstone bag? Should I wait a solid hour and then creep up again? The science of nympholepsy is a precise science. Actual contact would do it in one second flat. An interspace of a millimeter would do it in ten. Let us wait.</div>

<div class="line_en">The latter necessitated a trip to the bathroom for a draft of water which is the best medicine I know in my case, except perhaps milk with radishes; and when I re-entered the strange pale-striped fastness where Lolita's old and new clothes reclined in various attitudes of enchantment on pieces of furniture that seemed vaguely afloat, my impossible daughter sat up and in clear tones demanded a drink, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后者需要去浴室饮一通水，此时这是对我的病症最好的药，除非有牛奶加红萝卜；当我再走回那个奇异的、惨淡光线斑驳的堡垒，洛丽塔的新旧衣服以各种各样的魔法姿态斜靠在每件家俱上，家俱在模糊之中仿佛开始漂浮，我那不可能成为女儿的女儿坐了起来，用清晰的声音也要水喝。她把冰凉富有弹性的纸杯拿在阴影中的手里，感激地一饮而尽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And less than six inches from me and my burning life, was nebulous Lolita! After a long stirless vigil, my tentacles moved towards her again, and this time the creak of the mattress did not awake her. I managed to bring my ravenous bulk so close to her that I felt the aura of her bare shoulder like a warm breath upon my cheek. And then, she sat up, gasped, muttered with insane rapidity something about boats, tugged at the sheets and lapsed back into her rich, dark, young unconsciousness. As she tossed, within that abundant flow of sleep, recently auburn, at present lunar, her arm struck me across the face. For a second I held her. She freed herself from the shadow of my embrace -- doing this not consciously, not violently, not with any personal distaste, but with the neutral plaintive murmur of a child demanding its natural rest. And again the situation remained the same: Lolita with her curved spine to Humbert, Humbert resting his head on his hand and burning with desire and dyspepsia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离我和我燃烧的生命不到六英寸远就是模糊的洛丽塔！长时间平静的守夜之后，我的触角又朝她挪去，床垫的吱吱声没有将她吵醒。我将我贪婪的躯体移得离她那么近，能感觉到她裸露的肩头的气息象一股温热的气涌上我的脸颊。她突然坐了起来，喘息不止，用不正常的快速度嘟哝了什么船的事，使劲拉了拉床单，又重新陷进她丰富、幽昧、年轻的无知无觉状态。她辗转反侧，在睡梦富盈的流动中，她近来呈褐色、现在是月白色的胳膊搭在我的脸上。我握住一秒钟。她随即从我拥抱的阴影中解脱出去—这动作是不自觉的、不粗暴的，不带任何感情好恶，但是带着一个孩子渴望自然休息的灰暗、哀伤的低吟。一切又恢复原状：洛丽塔蜷曲的脊骨朝向亨伯特，亨伯特枕在手上，因欲念和消化不良而火烧火燎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had not dared offer her a second helping of the drug, and had not abandoned hope that the first might still consolidate her sleep. I started to move toward her, ready for any disappointment, knowing I had better wait but incapable of waiting. My pillow smelled of her hair. I moved toward my glimmering darling, stopping or retreating every time I thought she stirred or was about to stir. A breeze from wonderland had begun to affect my thoughts, and now they seemed couched in italics, as if the surface reflecting them were wrinkled by the phantasm of that breeze. Time and again my consciousness folded the wrong way, my shuffling body entered the sphere of sleep, shuffled out again, and once or twice I caught myself drifting into a melancholy snore. Mists of tenderness enfolded mountains of longing. Now and then it seemed to me that the enchanted prey was about to meet halfway the enchanted hunter, that her haunch was working its way toward me under the soft sand of a remote and fabulous beach; and then her dimpled dimness would stir, and I would know she was farther away from me than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不敢让她再服用那麻醉药，也没有放弃期望那第一片或许还能加固她的睡意。我开始向她移去，作好承受一切失败的准备，因为我明明知道最好还是等一等，但实在无力等下去。我的枕头散发着她头发的气味。我朝我晶莹的爱人移去，每次觉得她动了或正要动的时候便停下来，退后去。从奇境来的一阵微风，已经开始影响我的思绪，现在那些思绪似乎潜伏在斜体字中，仿佛反射它们的表面被那阵微风的幽灵吹皱了。我的意识一次次叠错着，我闪避的身体钻进睡眠的天体，又闪避出来，有一两次，我发现自己正在一阵忧郁的鼾声中漂浮。温柔的雾被封闭在渴求的山中。我偶尔以为那着魔的猎物就要与那着魔的猎人在半路相撞，她的臂不正在遥远而神话般的海滩柔软沙地下朝我而来；而后，她带着笑意的朦胧肉体稍一翻动，我就知道她比任何时候都离我更远更远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took the resilient and cold paper cup in her shadowy hand and gulped down its contents gratefully, her long eyelashes pointing cupward, and then, with an infantile gesture that carried more charm than any carnal caress, little Lolita wiped her lips against my shoulder. She fell back on her pillow (I had subtracted mine while she drank) and was instantly asleep again.</div>

<div class="line_en">A little after five a reverberating monologue began to arrive, in several installments, from some courtyard or parking place. It was not really a monologue, since the speaker stopped every few seconds to listen (presumably) to another fellow, but that other voice did not reach me, and so no real meaning could be derived from the part heard. Its matter-of-fact intonations, however, helped to bring in the dawn, and the room was already suffused with lilac gray, when several industrious toilets went to work, one after the other, and the clattering and whining elevator began to rise and take down early risers and downers, and for some minutes I miserably dozed, and Charlotte was a mermaid in a greenish tank, and somewhere in the passage Dr. Boyd said "Good morning to you" in a fruity voice, and birds were busy in the trees, and then Lolita yawned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五点刚过，一阵哆哆嗦嗦的独白就从乡间某处或停车场的地方传了过来。其实那并非独白，只是因为讲话人隔几秒钟就停下来（大概是）听另一个小伙子说话，但那另一个声音我听不见，因此，从能听到的那部分看不出任何意义。然而它乏味的语调却引进了黎明，房间已然被淡紫灰色充溢了，几个勤奋的厕所也已经开始工作，一个接一个，叮叮当当；低声哀怨的电梯开始接送起早的上楼客和下楼客，我痛苦地打了几分钟的磕睡，梦见夏洛特是绿水池里的美人鱼，过道里博伊德医生用宏亮的嗓音说：“向您致以早安”，鸟儿在树上忙碌起来，不久洛丽塔打了个哈欠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I dwell at some length on the tremors and gropings of that distant night, it is because I insist upon proving that I am not, and never was, and never could have been, a brutal scoundrel. The gentle and dreamy regions through which I crept were the patrimonies of poets -- not crime's prowling ground. Had I reached my goal, my ecstasy would have been all softness, a case of internal combustion of which she would hardly have felt the heat, even if she were wide awake. But I still hoped she might gradually be engulfed in a completeness of stupor that would allow me to taste more than a glimmer of her. And so, in between tentative approximations, with a confusion of perception metamorphosing her into eyespots of moonlight or a fluffy flowering bush, I would dream I regained consciousness, dream I lay in wait.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我之所以最终能滞留在兴奋的颤栗、以及对那遥远夜晚的摸索中，是因为我坚持要证明我现在不是、从来也不是、将来也不可能是一个兽性恶棍。我偷行过的那个温和朦胧的境地是诗人的遗产—不是罪犯潜巡的地狱。如果我够到了我的目标，我的狂热就会全部化作柔情，是一种即使她清醒时也感觉不到其热力的内心燃烧。但是我仍然希望她能渐渐陷入彻底的昏迷，这样我便可以体味更多，而不仅仅是她的晶莹。因此在趋向靠近当中，因为混乱的感觉将她变形为月光透下的眼状斑点或是覆满松软茸草、鲜花盛开的灌木，我于是梦见我重获知觉，梦见我躺卧在期待中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I gave a mediocre imitation of waking up. We lay quietly. I gently caressed her hair, and we gently kissed. Her kiss, to my delirious embarrassment, had some rather comical refinements of flutter and probe which made me conclude she had been coached at an early age by a little Lesbian. No Charlie boy could have taught her that. As if to see whether I had my fill and learned the lesson, she drew away and surveyed me. Her cheekbones were flushed, her full underlip glistened, my dissolution was near. All at once, with a burst of rough glee (the sign of the nymphet!), she put her mouth to my ear -- but for quite a while my mind could not separate into words the hot thunder of her whisper, and she laughed, and brushed the hair off her face, and tried again, and gradually the odd sense of living in a brand new, mad new dream world, where everything was permissible, came over me as I realized what she was suggesting. I answered I did not know what game she and Charlie had played. "You mean you have never --?"-- her features twisted into a stare of disgusted incredulity. "You have never --" she started again. I took time out by nuzzling her a little. "Lay off, will you," she said with a twangy whine, hastily removing her brown shoulder from my lips. (It was very curious the way she considered -- and kept doing so for a long time -- all caresses except kisses on the mouth or the stark act of love either "romantic slosh" or "abnormal".)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我假装平常醒来的动作。我们静静地躺着。我轻轻抚弄她的头发，我们轻轻地亲吻。她的吻颤动着探寻着，有一种颇富喜剧性的精美，这使我在狂热中困惑地得出结论：她很小就受过一个小同性恋的训练。不可能有一个查理男孩教她那一套。仿佛要看看我是否已经尽兴并学过这一课，她缩回身，观察我。她的脸颊通红，丰满的下唇闪耀着光泽，我马上要崩溃了。就在一瞬间，在一阵粗野的欢快声（性感少女的标志！）中，她将嘴凑到我的耳边—但有好一阵我还是不能悟出她那旱天雷般耳语的真正含意，她笑着，甩开脸上的头发，又说了一遍，渐渐地，当我明白了她的提议是什么时，一种象是生活在崭新的、疯狂般崭新梦幻世界里的奇异感觉便向我涌来，那个世界里一切都可以畅行无阻。我说我不知道她和查理做过的游戏是什么。“你的意思是你从来没—”—她的面容扭曲成一种反感的怀疑，瞪大了眼睛。“你从来没—”她又问起。我乘机朝她挪近。“躺开，行不行啊你，”她说，带着鼻音的哀怨，迅速地将她褐色的肩膀从我唇边移开。（真是古怪—后来很长时间一直如此—她把一切除去亲吻和僵硬的爱的举动之外的抚爱都视为既“缺乏浪漫”又“变态失常”。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, I shall not bore my learned readers with a detailed account of Lolita's presumption. Suffice it to say that not a trace of modesty did I perceive in this beautiful hardly formed young girl whom modern co-education, juvenile mores, the campfire racket and so forth had utterly and hopelessly depraved. She saw the stark act merely as part of a youngster's furtive world, unknown to adults. What adults did for purposes of procreation was no business of hers. My life was handled by little Lo in an energetic, matter-of-fact manner as if it were an insensate gadget unconnected with me. While eager to impress me with the world of tough kids, she was not quite prepared for certain discrepancies between a kid's life and mine. Pride alone prevented her from giving up; for, in my strange predicament, I feigned supreme stupidity and had her have her way -- at least while I could still bear it. But really these are irrelevant matters; I am not concerned with so-called "sex" at all. Anybody can imagine those elements of animality. A greater endeavor lures me on: to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，我不会拿洛丽塔任何冒然的细节叙述让我博学的读者们厌烦。只说我在这个美丽的巧夺天工的少女身上没有感觉出任何美德的蛛迹就够了，现代综合教育、少年风尚、篝火欢宴等等已经将她彻底败坏难以挽回。她把赤裸的行为只看作年轻人秘密世界的一部分，不为成年人所知。成年人为生育而做的却不关她事。我的生活被小洛用精力旺盛、实际又乏味的方式操纵了，仿佛那是一个设计精巧却与我无关、毫无感觉的小机械。虽然她急于用她坚韧的孩子世界影响我，却没有对一个孩子和我的生活之间的矛盾做出任何准备。骄傲阻止她放弃；因为，处在我奇异的困境中，我只能装出更大的愚蠢，任她为所欲为—至少在我不能忍受的时候。但确实，这些都是无关的事；我根本就毫不关心所谓的“性”。每个人都能想象出兽性的本质。一个更大的欲望引诱我继续：去坚决地确定性感少女危险的魔力。">查看中文翻译</div>
