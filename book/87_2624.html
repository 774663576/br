<div class="line_en">She forced herself to look at it, at the slick puddles of greenish ichor that dripped from the holes in its rounded, hairy body. It had been shot several times and from the noxious ooze that seeped from the wounds, she guessed that it had still been alive and crawling not twenty minutes ago, maybe less.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill stared down at the curled, bristling legs of the abomination, her skin crawling. The creature that had attacked her by the courtyard entrance had been terrifying, but so alien that she hadn't been able to relate it to anything. Spiders, on the other hand… she already hated them, hated their dark, bustling bodies and skittering legs. This one had been the mother of all of them and even dead, it frightened her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔看到它那布满了毛且丑陋无比的腿时，就觉得浑身起鸡皮疙瘩。这个在中庭入口的铁梯子处出现的怪物不仅仅长得恐布，由于其体内含有某些其他的成分，所以无法把与其他的生物联系起来。另外这个怪物是蜘蛛…吉尔从小就讨厌蜘蛛，讨厌它那带有黑色光泽的身体以及快速移动的腿。而现在挡在自己眼前的这个家伙，就是那种蜘蛛们的祖宗。即使死了，也是很可怕的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whispering streams of the sticky stuff clung to her boots, making it a struggle to move. She took careful, deliberate steps, determined not to fall. The thought of being covered in spider web, having it clinging to her entire body… she shuddered again, swallowing thickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="粘稠的蜘蛛丝附着的皮靴底上，令她举步维艰。同时吉尔还要注意不要摔倒，小心地移动着脚步。如果自己被蜘蛛网牢牢地粘住而无法自由行动的话…吉尔再次颤抖起来，勉强地咽下了一口唾沫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill grabbed the handle of one of the doors and pushed it open, stumbling out into yet another gloomy passage. She leaned back against the door and breathed deeply, barely resisting the urge to brush wildly at her clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">At least she knew she was on the right track, and close behind whoever had triggered the tunnel mechanism. Neat trick, that. When she'd reached the area where the pit had been, she'd thought that maybe she'd gotten lost after all. The gaping hole had been gone, smooth stone in its place. Looking up, she'd seen the ragged edges of the pit suspended overhead; the entire center section of the tunnel had been flipped over, turned like a giant wheel by some miracle of engineering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少现在知道自己走的是一条正确道路，而且还在接近那个使坑道中的机关运作起来的人。那真是个巧妙的机关。当赶到那个有着一个巨大洞穴的地方时，结果还以为自己迷路了呢。龟裂消失了，洞穴也不见了，那里只有平坦的石头地面。抬头仰望，刚才看到的那道裂缝竟然在上面。应该是坑道的某一部分发生了一百八十度的旋转，就像是个巨大的车轮一样。真是令人感到无比惊奇的工程技术啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The short, empty tunnel ran left to right in front of her, a door at either end, but the door to her left was set into the same wall as the one she'd just exited, leading back toward the courtyard. Jill opted for the one on the right, hoping that her sense of direction was still intact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在眼前，一条什么都没有的短距离坑道朝左右两侧延伸，在每个方向的尽头各有一扇门。但是左侧的那道门安置在与吉尔过来来时相同的方向，也就是说那是一扇返回中庭的门。于是，吉尔自然而然地选押了右侧的那扇门，她在心里祈祷自己的方向感还没有变得混乱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill grinned and started for the shaft, seeing that the lift's platform had been taken up. Chances were good that she was still on the trail of Enrico's killer… but maybe not. Maybe he went the other way, and you're about to lose him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔微微一笑，迈步走向升降机，可是她发现升降平台已经上升到高处。难道说自己将杀害恩里克的凶手跟丢了吗？嗯，也许并没有。也许杀人犯选择了其他的通道。我还没有输…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The metal door creaked open and she stepped in, feeling the change in the air immediately. The tunnel split in front of her. To the right, a thickening of shadow where the rock walls opened into another corridor. But to her left was a small elevator shaft like the ones in the courtyard. A warm, delicious wind swept down and over her, the sweet air like a forgotten dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钢铁的大门发出“嘎吱”声被打开，吉尔随即就感到了空气的变化。坑道在前面分成两条岔路，右边连接着一条新的回廊，只能看到一团模模糊糊的阴影。但是在左边设有在中庭出现过的小型降机平台。从那边吹来一阵微风，吹得吉尔感到了些许暖意，彷佛充满了忘却梦境中的空气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked into the stone corridor that stretched in front of her, the temperature immediately dropping back to the now familiar unpleasant chill. The tunnel extended several feet to her right and dead ended. To her left, a massive, rounded boulder like the one she'd seen before marked the other end, a good hundred feet away. And there was something small laying in front of it, something blue…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔毅然走进向刖方延伸的石头回廊中，于是湿度急刻下降，再次感受到那股熟悉的冰冷空气。坑道的右手几英尼之外就是尽头，左边有一块刚才在其他坑道中看见过的巨石将通道挡住。吉尔发现在巨死的前面有一个小小的东西，好像是蓝色的…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="走进那条狭窄的岔路，她发现通道入口处的石头有磨损的痕迹。在右手边有一个小门。果然这条岔路与房间是隐藏在翻转岂壁的后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She opened the door and looked inside. A mid-sized square room of rough stone, a statue of a bird on a pedestal the only decoration. There was no other exit, and Jill felt a sudden rush of relief as the implications sank in. She could leave the underground tunnels; the killer had to have left already.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔打开巴，朝房间里窥视。这是一个用石头堆砌而成的四方形房间，里面有一个鸟的雕像放在台座上，这就是房间里惟一的装饰品。没有其他的门。看清了整个情况，吉尔突然松了一口气。因为终可以离开这条地下通道了。这里没有任何人，也就是说杀人犯已经利用那个小型升降机逃到上面去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frowning, Jill walked toward the giant rock, trying to make out the blue object. Halfway down the dim tunnel was an offshoot to the left, and she recognized the metal plate next to it as the same kind of mechanism that had moved the pit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔皱着眉朝巨石走去，想要确认那个蓝色的物体到底是什么东西。在来到坑道中间的位置时，左侧有一条岔路，吉尔看到在岔路的墙上设置有一个与刚才将那个洞穴进行翻转移动的机关相同的金属板。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a book-box. Her father had told her about them, though she'd never actually seen one. There was a cut-away section of pages behind the cover where valuables could be hidden, though this one was empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拿在手里时吉尔才发现，原来那是一个书本型的箱子。虽然曾经听父亲提起过，但这还是第一次真正地看到实体物品。虽然外表和书本一模一样，但是书页的部份可以抽取出来，可以在那里隐藏一些重要的东西。但是这个箱子里什么都没有…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smiling, she stepped back out into the corridor and started toward the giant rock, still curious about the blue thing. As she got closer, she saw that it was a book, bound in blue-dyed leather. It had been thrown carelessly against the base of the stone, laying face down and open. She slung the Remington across her back and crouched down to pick it up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔微笑着准备返回走廊，朝着巨石走去，于是再一次注意到了那个蓝色的物体。随着不断靠近，她看清了那一本书，用染成了蓝色皮革装订而成。看起来是有人草率地将它扔在巨石下面，吉尔将散弹枪放回到背后，弯腰将书检起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dropping the book, Jill sprinted for cover, arms and legs pumping as the rumbling grew louder, the tripped boulder picking up momentum. The dark opening of the offshoot seemed miles away -- won 't make it, gonna die -- and she could almost feel the tons of stone bearing down on her, wanted desperately to look but knew that the split-second difference would kill her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔扔下书，开始拼命地奔跑。“轰隆轰隆”的声音逐渐变得越来越大，那块巨石正在滚动。——我不想被压死啊。虽然感觉到巨石就追到身后，吉尔还是拼命克制着自己想要回头的心情，因为这几秒钟无意义的动作就可能将自己带入死亡的深渊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a final, desperate burst of speed she dove for the opening, crashing to the floor and jerking her legs in as the massive rock rolled past, missing her by inches.

<div class="line_cn" title="千钧一发之际，吉尔飞扑进岔道的空间里。巨大的岩石擦过吉尔的身边。就在她长长地呼出一口气的时候，巨石发出了震耳欲聋的轰鸣声后与坑道的尽头猛烈地碰撞在一起，震得吉尔的骨髓都在跟着一起摇晃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment, it was all she could do to huddle against the cold floor and not throw up. When that passed, she slowly got to her feet and dusted herself off. The heels of her hands were abraded and both her knees bruised from the running dive, but compared to being smashed flat by a big rock, she thought she had definitely made the right choice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔将身体蜷缩起来蹲在地上，甚至都无法抬起头。进行过几次深呼吸之后，好不容易地慢慢站起身来，并将落在衣服上的灰尘抖落。由于刚才的动作太猛双手都被石头擦破，虽然膝盖上也有些许撞伤。但是一想到被那块惊人的巨石压扁，很明显吉尔做出了一个正确的选择。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After he'd left Rebecca, he'd continued down the hall and found room 003 at the end, the ladder to the basement level tucked discreetly behind a bookcase in the neatly kept bedroom.

<div class="line_cn" title="将瑞贝卡留在那间实验室里之后，克里斯在走廊里继续前进，又发现了“003号房”。在那间收拾得十分整洁的卧室的书架后面，克里斯发现了一条通往地下室的梯子。下来之后，是一条冰冷混凝土建成的走廊，荧光灯在头顶一闪一闪地，并发出“啪啪”的声音。与楼上单纯用木头建造的毫无装饰的宿舍相比，真一种戏剧性的变化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The basement was dominated by a giant glass-fronted tank in the center of the room that extended floor to ceiling, a large, jagged hole toward the bottom right-hand side.

<div class="line_cn" title="在房间的正中央，有一个巨大的玻璃制成的水槽几乎占据了整个空间。大概有天苌板那么高，底座部份的旁侧被打开了一个巨大的洞。克里斯虽然不擅长目测，但是从浸水的程度来判断的话，这个水槽至少有数千加仑的容量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chris sighed, and stepped into the water. It was cold, and had an unpleasant chemical smell. He waded down to the door, the water sliding up over his knees and finally stopping at mid-thigh, sloshing gently. Shivering, he pushed the door open and moved inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door flew open and Chris stumbled in, falling and kicking frantically. His boot connected solidly with the shark's fleshy snout, deflecting it from the opening. In a flash, he was on his feet. He threw his weight into the door and in a slap of water, it was closed.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯握住控制杆，然后一拉。在门外响起了某种滑动金属的声音，接着水位开始下降。在一分钟之内，积水从门缝下面全部流出去，从被破坏的木曹方向传来了液体发出的“咕噜咕噜”声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker had shot four of the shuffling, gasping Umbrella workers on his way to the computer room on level three. He hadn't recognized any of them, though he was pretty sure that the second one he'd taken out had been Steve Keller, one of the guys from Special Research.

<div class="line_en">He sat at the computer in the cool, sterile room and waited for the system to boot up, feeling truly on top of things for the first time all day. He'd had earlier moments, of course. The way he'd handled Barry, finding the wolf medal in the tunnels -- even shooting Ellen Smith in the face had given him a momentary sense of accomplishment, a feeling that he was in control of what was happening.
