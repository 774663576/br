<div class="line_en">"Why not go on fieldwork then?" The question was posed by a colleague at the end of a somewhat bibulous review of the state of the art of anthropology, university teaching and academic life in general. The review had not been favourable. Like Mrs Hubbard we had taken stock and found the cupboard was bare.</div>

<div class="line_en">My story was a familiar one. I had been raised in the institutions of higher education and drifted more by chance than design into teaching. University life in England is based upon a number of untenable assumptions. First, it is assumed that if you are a good student you will be good at research. If you are good at research, you will be good at teaching. If you are good at teaching, you will wish to go on fieldwork. None of these connections holds. Excellent students do appalling research. Superb academic performers, whose names are never out of the trade journals, provide lectures of such stultifying tedium that students vote with their feet and disappear like dew in the African sun. The profession is full of devoted fieldworkers, skins leathery from exposure to torrid climes, teeth permanently gritted from years of dealing with natives, who have little or nothing of interest to say in an academic discipline. The whole subject of fieldwork, we effete "new anthropologists" with our doctorates based on library research had decided, had been made rather too much of. Of course, older teaching staff who had seen service in the days of empire and "just sort of picked up anthropology in the line of business" had a vested interest in maintaining the cult of the god to whom they were high priests. They had damn well suffered the trials and privations of swamp and jungle and no young whippersnapper should take a short cut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的故事十分寻常——受训于高等学府，非经刻意规划，而是机缘使然进入教书行业。英国的学术生涯奠基于几个经不起考验的假设。首先：如果你是优秀学生，便会成为不错的研究者。第二，如果你的研究做得不错，书就铁定教得不坏。第三，如果你善于教书，便会渴望去做田野调查。上述关连统统不成立。优秀的学生有时研究成果可怕。学术表现杰出，名字经常出现在专业期刊上的研究者，有时教起书来愚蠢乏味到让学生以脚投票，像非洲艳阳下的晨露般消失无踪。人类学行业也不乏全心奉献的田野工作者，他们的肌肤被炎热气候烤干如皮革，牙关因长年与原住民奋斗而终日紧咬，但是他们却对人类学理论殊无贡献。我们这些依据文献研究完成博士论文、文弱的“新人类学者”认为所谓的“田野调查”——其重要性被夸大了。当然，在殖民时代有过实践经验、“无意间搞起人类学”的老教授坚持田野调查的“神祇崇拜”不可毁，因为他们是这个行业的大祭司。他们可是受尽了沼泽、丛林的磨炼与贫困，自以为是的年轻学者岂容抄捷径。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever pressed in debate over some point of theory or metaphysics, they would shake their heads sadly, draw languidly on their pipes or stroke their beards and mutter something about "real people" not fitting the clear abstractions of those who "had never done fieldwork". They evinced genuine pity for these deprived fellows but the matter was perfectly clear to them. They had been there, they had seen. There was nothing more to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当这些老教授在理论或形而上学的辩论场合被逼到墙角，便会悲哀摇头，懒洋洋抽烟斗或抚弄胡须，喃喃说道“真人”无法嵌进“从未做过田野调查者”的纯粹抽象概念里。他们对无缘踏入田野的人满怀同情。事实很简单，他们曾到过田野，他们看到了。没什么好说的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After several years teaching the received orthodoxies in a department of anthropology of no particular academic distinction, the time was perhaps right for change. It was far from easy to determine whether doing fieldwork was one of the unpleasant tasks like national service that might quite properly be suffered in silence, or whether it was one of the "perks" of the business that a man should feel grateful for. Colleagues' opinions were of no real help. Most had had plenty of time to enfold their experiences in a rosy glow of romantic adventure. The fact of past fieldwork is something of a licence to be a bore. One's friends and relatives are a trifle disappointed if every subject from doing the washing to treating the common cold is not larded with a sauce of ethnographic reminiscence. Old stories become old friends in themselves and soon nothing but the good times of fieldwork remain bar a few awkward islands of unreduced misery that cannot be forgotten or submerged in the general euphoria. For example, I had a colleague who claimed to have had the most marvellous time with agreeable, smiling natives bringing gifts of fruit and flowers by the basketful. But the inner chronology of the stay was provided by statements of the form, "That happened after I got food poisoning" or "I wasn't too steady on my feet at that time since I still had the festering boil under my toes". One suspected that the whole business was rather like those cheery war reminiscences that make one regret, against all better knowledge, not having been alive at the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">But perhaps there was something to be gained by the experience. Tutorials would never drag again. When faced with the obligation to talk about a subject on which naturally ignorant, I should be able to reach into my ragbag of ethnographic anecdotes, as my teachers had done in their day, and produce some long-winded story that would keep my pupils quiet for up to ten minutes. A whole range of techniques for squashing people also becomes available. The memory of one occasion, as ever, returns. I was at a conference, dull even by normal standards, making polite conversation with several of my betters who included two very grim Australian ethnographers. As if by some prearranged sign, the others withdrew leaving me starkly exposed to the antipodean horrors. After several minutes of silence, I tentatively suggested a drink in the hope of breaking the ice. The female ethnographer gathered her face into a vile grimace. "Nah!" she cried, mouth twisted with disgust, "we've seen too much of it in the bush." Fieldwork has the great benefit of making such phrases available; they are quite properly denied to lesser mortals.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is the use of such turns of phrase, I suspect, that has conferred that valuable aura of eccentricity upon the really rather dull denizens of anthropology departments. Anthropologists have been very lucky in their public image. Sociologists, it is well known, are humourless, left-wing purveyors of nonsense or truisms. But anthropologists have sat at the feet of Hindu saints, they have viewed strange gods and filthy rites, they have boldly gone where no man has gone before. The reek of sanctity and divine irrelevance hangs about them. They are saints of the English church of eccentricity for its own sake. The chance of joining them was not to be lightly rejected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许就是这些怪句子，使得本质乏味的人类学冠上珍贵的怪诞脱轨气息。从这个角度而言，人类学者的公众形象实在侥幸。众所周知，社会学者缺乏幽默感，是左翼狂想与陈腐之言的大买办。但是人类学者曾追随印度教圣者，看过奇特神祇与污秽仪式，大胆深入人迹未达之处，他们全身散发一股崇髙气息与神圣的不切题，他们本身就是英国怪诞教会的圣者。我岂能轻易拒绝成为其中一员？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To be fair, there was also the possibility to be considered -- slight though it might be -- that fieldwork would make some great contribution to human knowledge. On the face of it this seemed rather unlikely. Fact-gathering in itself has few charms. Anthropology is not short of facts but simply of anything intelligent to do with them. The notion of "butterfly-collecting" is familiar within the discipline and serves to characterize the endeavours of many ethnographers and failed interpreters, who simply amass neat examples of curious customs arranged by area, or alphabetically, or by evolutionary order, whatever the current style may be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凭良心说，我也考虑了其他好处（虽然机率不大），替如田野工作可对人类知识有所奉献。乍看之下，这种可能性极低。“资料搜集”（fact—gathering，或译事实搜集）的工作殊无趣味。人类学不乏资料，少的是具体使用这些资料的智慧。这行业有所谓的“捕蝶人”，用来形容许多辛苦收集资料的民族志学者，他们根据地域、字母或任何最新流行的分类法，不断累积资料，却没有能力解释它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frankly, it seemed then, and seems now, that the justification for fieldwork, as for all academic endeavour, lies not in one's contribution to the collectivity but rather in some selfish development. Like monastic life, academic research is really all about the perfection of one's own soul. This may well serve some wider purpose but is not to be judged on those grounds alone. This view will doubtless not sit well either with conservative academics or those who see themselves as a revolutionary force. Both are afflicted by a dreadful piety, a preening self-importance that refuses to believe the world is not hanging on their every word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老实讲，不管是当时或现在，我都觉得田野工作或其他学术研究，其正当性不在对集体的贡献，而是远为自私的个人成长。学术研究就像修道院生活，专注追求个人性灵的完美。其结果或许会服务较大层面，却不能以此论断它的本质。不难想象，这种观点不容于学界保守派与自诩改革者。他们深陷恐怖的虔诚与洋洋自得中，拒绝相信世界其实并不系于他们的一言一行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For this reason, outrage was quite general within the discipline when Malinowski, the "inventor" of fieldwork, was revealed as a rather human and flawed vessel in his diaries. Even he had been infuriated and bored by "blacks", tormented by lust and isolation. It was widely felt that the diaries should have been suppressed, that they were a "disservice to the subject", that they were gratuitously iconoclastic and would lead to all manner of disrespect for the elders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为如此，当田野工作的“发明者”马林诺夫斯基（Bronislaw Kasper Malinowski）的日记出版，揭露他也是有缺点的凡人时，在人类学界激起了义愤。虽然马氏在日记中诚实说黑人令他愤怒与乏味，而且他深为欲望与孤寂所苦。学界却普遍认为马氏日记不应出版，因为它对人类学造成“伤害”、无故破坏偶像，让大众对人类学先驱失去景仰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This reveals a rather intolerable hypocrisy on the part of the purveyors of the art and should be remedied at every opportunity. It is with such thoughts in mind that I undertake the writing of this account of my own endeavours. There will be nothing new here for those who have undergone the same experience but I shall dwell precisely on those aspects that the normal ethnographic monograph punctuates out as "not anthropology", "irrelevant", "unimportant". In my professional work I have always been more attracted by the higher levels of abstraction and theoretical speculation since it is only by progress here that the overall possibility of interpretation moves closer. Keeping one's eyes firmly fixed on the ground is the surest way of ensuring an uninteresting and partial view. This book may, then, serve to redress the balance and show students and, it is hoped, non-anthropologists, how the finished monograph relates to the "bleeding chunks" of raw reality on which it is based, and convey something of the feel of fieldwork to those who have not had that experience.</div>

<div class="line_en">The idea of "doing fieldwork" was now planted in my mind and the seed would grow as such things always do. "Why should I want to do fieldwork?" I asked a colleague. He made an expansive gesture that I recognized as belonging to his lecturing repertoire. It was used on occasions where students asked questions like "What is truth?" or "How do you spell 'cat'?" Enough had been said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，投入田野工作的想法已经深植我心，不断滋长。我问某位同事：“我为何应做田野调查？”他摆出夸张姿势，那是他在讲堂上的标准肢体语言，用来应付学生的“何谓真理”或“‘猫’要怎么写”这类提问。他的意思够明白了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is a polite fiction that anthropologists are consumed with a fire to live among one single people on the face of this planet whom they believe to be guardians of a secret of great relevance to the rest of the human race, and to suggest they work elsewhere is like suggesting they might have married anyone but their unique spiritual soul-mate. In my own case, my thesis had been written on Old English material in published and manuscript form. As I put it somewhat pretentiously then, I "travelled in time, not space". The phrase mollified my examiners, who nevertheless felt obliged to wag their fingers at me and warn me to work henceforth in more conventional geographic areas. I thus had no loyalties to any particular continent and, not having specialized at the undergraduate level, I was not repelled by any particular locale. Judging personally on the basis of completed work as the reflection of the people studied rather than as the image of those who had studied them, Africa seemed by far the dullest continent. After a great start with Evans-Pritchard the work tailed rapidly downhill into pseudosociology and descent systems as functioning wholes, rallying a little as it was dragged screaming into the consideration of "difficulf" topics such as prescriptive marriage and symbolism, but basically remaining true to its "plain and sensible" persona. African anthropology must be one of the few areas where dull pedestrianism is advanced seriously as a claim to merit. South America looked fascinating but I knew from colleagues that working there was notoriously difficult politically; moreover, everyone seemed to be working in the shadow of Lévi-Strauss and the French anthropologists. Oceania would be a soft option in terms of conditions of life but somehow all Oceanic studies ended up looking much the same. Aborigines seemed to have the monopoly on fiendishly complex marriage systems. India would be a splendid location but to do anything sensible would require sitting down for five years to learn enough languages to make any contribution at all. The Far East? I would go away and look up what I could.</div>

It seems to be a rule of thumb that neat symbolic systems often turn up most clearly where such phenomena occur.

I was directed towards the Bubis of Fernando Po. For those who have not come across Fernando Po, let me explain that it is an island off the coast of West Africa, a former Spanish colony and administered as part of Equatorial Guinea. I began to sniff around the literature. Everyone was highly uncomplimentary about Fernando Po and the Bubis. The British scorned it as a place "where one is likely in late afternoon to encounter a sloppy Spanish official still in his pyjamas", and dwelt lovingly on the fetid heat and numerous diseases to which it offered sanctuary. Nineteenth-century German explorers dismissed the natives as degenerate. Mary Kingsley noted the island as affording the prospect of a large heap of coal. Richard Burton, it appeared, had amazed everyone by actually going there and surviving. All in all a depressing prospect. Luckily for me, as I thought at the time, the local dictator began a policy of massacring his opponents, using the term in a very loose sense. I could no longer go to Fernando Po.</div>
