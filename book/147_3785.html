<div class="line_en">He pressed his high knees uncomfortably against the bottom of his desk, grew nostalgic on his dreams. Bessie Barnes scrawled vigorously two rows away, displaying her long full silken leg. Open for me the gates of delight. Behind her sat a girl named Ruth, dark, with milk-white skin, eyes as gentle as her name, and thick black hair, parted in middle. He thought of a wild life with Bessie and of a later resurrection, a pure holy life, with Ruth.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, after the noon recess, they were marshalled by the teachers -- all of the children in the three upper grades -- and marched upstairs to the big assembly hall. They were excited, and gossiped in low voices as they went. They had never been called upstairs at this hour. Quite often the bells rang in the halls: they sprang quickly into line and were marched out in double files. That was fire drill. They liked that. Once they emptied the building in four minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was something new. They marched into the big room and sat down in blocks of seats assigned to each class: they sat with a seat between each of them. In a moment the door of the principal's office on the left -- where little boys were beaten -- was opened, and the principal came out. He walked around the corner of the big room and stepped softly up on the platform. He began to talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是这次却不同。他们走进一个大厅，按班级依次坐定，每两人之间都留了一个空位。过了一会儿，会场左侧的校长办公室——小男生经常挨揍的地方——门开了，校长走了出来。他绕过会堂的一角，轻轻地踏上讲台，然后开始讲起话来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was a new principal. Young Armstrong, who had smelled the flower so delicately, and who had visited Daisy, and who once had almost beaten Eugene because of the smutty rhymes, was gone. The new principal was older. He was about thirty-eight years old. He was a strong rather heavy man a little under six feet tall; he was one of a large family who had grown up on a Tennessee farm. His father was poor but he had helped his children to get an education. All this Eugene knew already, because the principal made long talks to them in the morning and said he had never had their advantages. He pointed to himself with some pride. And he urged the little boys, playfully but earnestly, to "be not like dumb, driven cattle, be a hero in the strife." That was poetry, Longfellow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位是新来的校长。原先那位年轻的阿姆斯特朗，就是那位经常嗅闻花香、找过黛西、尤金因写歪诗而差点挨他揍的校长，现在他已经离开这儿了。新校长的年纪更大一些，大约38岁左右，身高将近6英尺，长得健壮而结实。他出生于田纳西州一个子女很多的农家。他的父亲没有多少钱，但却尽力让孩子们都接受了教育。尤金早就知道这些了，因为校长在晨训的时候给他们讲了很多道理，说他本人从来没有他们这么好的读书条件。他提起自己的时候显得非常得意。他用玩笑、真挚的口吻对孩子们说：“勿做笨牛需驱策，需做英雄求上进。”这是诗人朗费罗的诗句。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The principal had thick powerful shoulders; clumsy white arms, knotted with big awkward country muscles. Eugene had seen him once hoeing in the schoolyard; each of them had been given a plant to set out. He got those muscles on the farm. The boys said he beat very hard. He walked with a clumsy stealthy tread -- awkward and comical enough, it is true, but he could be up at a boy's back before you knew it. Otto Krause called him Creeping Jesus. The name stuck, among the tough crowd. Eugene was a little shocked by it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="校长宽阔的肩膀，笨拙的手臂上布满了乡下人特有的一块块肌肉。尤金曾经在校园里看见有一次他在锄地，他让每个孩子都要种植一棵植物。他身上的一块块肌肉就是干农活的时候长起来的。孩子们都说他打人的时候下手很重。他走路的时候举止笨拙、偷偷摸摸的——既难看又可笑，但是他却常常在你全然不知的情况下突然出现在你的面前。奥托·克劳斯称他为“鬼鬼祟祟的耶稣”。这一绰号很快就在那帮调皮捣蛋的孩子之间传开了。尤金刚听到这个称呼时有些吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The principal had a white face of waxen transparency, with deep flat cheeks like the Pentlands, a pallid nose, a trifle deeper in its color than his face, and a thin slightly-bowed mouth. His hair was coarse, black, and thick, but he never let it grow too long. He had short dry hands, strong, and always coated deeply with chalk. When he passed near by, Eugene got the odor of chalk and of the schoolhouse: his heart grew cold with excitement and fear. The sanctity of chalk and school hovered about the man's flesh. He was the one who could touch without being touched, beat without being beaten. Eugene had terrible fantasies of resistance, shuddering with horror as he thought of the awful consequences of fighting back: something like God's fist in lightning. Then he looked around cautiously to see if any one had noticed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="校长的脸色跟白蜡一样透明，扁平的脸颊和彭特兰家的人一样。他的鼻子苍白，比面部肤色稍深一些。他薄薄的嘴唇有点儿弯曲，头发又黑、又粗、又密，但从来不会让它长得太长。他的手指虽然短粗但却非常有力，上面经常沾满了粉笔灰。他每次从身边走过时，尤金都能闻见一股粉笔和教室特有的味道。他立刻会冒出一身冷汗，感到既兴奋又害怕。那人浑身上下散发着粉笔和学校的神圣气味。他可以碰人，人却不能碰他；他可以打人，但人却不能打他。尤金曾经产生过反抗的可怕幻想，但是一想起出手还击的可怕情景时，便会不寒而栗，他似乎看见上帝的拳头在电闪雷鸣中朝他袭来。接着他小心地四下望了望，看看有没有引起别人的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a good man, a dull man, a man of honor. He had a broad streak of coarse earthy brutality in him. He loved a farm better than anything in the world except a school. He had rented a big dilapidated house in a grove of lordly oaks on the outskirts of town: he lived there with his wife and his two children. He had a cow -- he was never without a cow: he would go out at night and morning to milk her, laughing his vacant silly laugh, and giving her a good smacking kick in the belly to make her come round into position.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是一个好人，一个乏味刻板的人，一个品性高尚、值得尊敬的人。他的脾气很大，发起火来非常凶。除了学校，他在这个世界上最热爱的就是农田了。他在郊区一片橡树环抱的地方租了间破旧的大房子，跟老婆、两个孩子住在一起。他养了一头牛——他从来没有离开过牛。每天早晚他都会去挤奶，一边莫名其妙地笑着，一边朝牛肚子上踢上两脚，好让它站好位置方便挤奶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He talked to the children aimlessly, pompously, dully for twenty minutes every morning: the teachers yawned carefully behind their hands, the students made furtive drawings, or passed notes. He spoke to them of "the higher life" and of "the things of the mind." He assured them that they were the leaders of tomorrow and the hope of the world. Then he quoted Longfellow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天早晨，他都会这样毫无目的、滔滔不绝、单调乏味地讲上20分钟。老师们小心地用手捂住嘴打着哈欠，学生们则忙着在纸上画漫画、递条子。他有时候会谈到“高尚生活”和“人的精神世界”。他再三告诫学生，说他们都是未来的领袖，是世界的希望，然后再引用朗费罗的诗句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The principal's name was Leonard. He made long speeches to the children every morning, after a ten-minute prayer. He had a high sonorous countrified voice which often trailed off in a comical drawl; he got lost very easily in revery, would pause in the middle of a sentence, gaze absently off with his mouth half-open and an expression of stupefaction on his face, and return presently to the business before him, his mind still loose, with witless distracted laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="校长的名字叫作伦纳德。每天早晨做完10分钟的祷告之后，他都会向孩子们发表长篇讲话。他讲起话来声音高亢、洪亮，带着乡下人的口音，常常在一句话结束的时候拖着长长的调子，听起来特别滑稽。他讲话的时候非常专注，结果一句话刚说一半便停在那里，眼睛出神地凝望着某个地方，嘴巴半张，脸上露出麻木的傻样。过了半晌他才会回到话题上来，而思想依然不够集中，偶尔还会失神地笑一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a heavy-handed master. He put down rebellion with good cornfield violence. If a boy was impudent to him he would rip him powerfully from his seat, drag his wriggling figure into his office, breathing stertorously as he walked along at his clumsy rapid gait, and saying roundly, in tones of scathing contempt: "Why, you young upstart, we'll just see who's master here. I'll show you, my sonny, if I'm to be dictated to by every two-by-four whippersnapper who comes along." And once within the office, with the glazed door shut, he published the stern warning of his justice by the loud exertion of his breathing, the cutting swish of his rattan, and the yowls of pain and terror that he exacted from his captive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是个非常严厉的校长。一旦有调皮捣蛋的学生，他都会粗野地予以制服。如果哪个男生在他面前无礼，他就会凶狠地把他从座位上拽起来，不顾他的拼命挣扎，带到办公室里去。他一路疾走，一边喘着粗气、高声地骂着：“哼，你这个小浑蛋，我倒想看看谁是这儿的校长。小子，我要让你见识见识，你们这些小崽子还想在我跟前逞威风。”一旦进了办公室，他就会把光亮的房门关起来，里面就会传来藤条抽打人的声音、孩子哇哇的喊叫声以及他本人的喘气声。他淋漓尽致地表现了自己怎样执法如山。">查看中文翻译</div>

The children sat, staring dumbly up at him as he made a rambling explanation of what he wanted. Finally he announced a prize.

<div class="line_en">They were to write a paper on the meaning of a French picture called The Song of the Lark. It represented a French peasant girl, barefooted, with a sickle in one hand, and with face upturned in the morning-light of the fields as she listened to the bird-song. They were asked to describe what they saw in the expression of the girl's face. They were asked to tell what the picture meant to them. It had been reproduced in one of their readers. A larger print was now hung up on the platform for their inspection. Sheets of yellow paper were given them. They stared, thoughtfully masticating their pencils. Finally, the room was silent save for a minute scratching on paper.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene wrote: "The girl is hearing the song of the first lark. She knows that it means Spring has come. She is about seventeen or eighteen years old. Her people are very poor, she has never been anywhere. In the winter she wears wooden shoes. She is making out as if she was going to whistle. But she doesn't let on to the bird that she has heard him. The rest of her people are behind her, coming down the field, but we do not see them. She has a father, a mother, and two brothers. They have worked hard all their life. The girl is the youngest child. She thinks she would like to go away somewhere and see the world. Sometimes she hears the whistle of a train that is going to Paris. She has never ridden on a train in her life. She would like to go to Paris. She would like to have some fine clothes, she would like to travel. Perhaps she would like to start life new in America, the Land of Opportunity. The girl has had a hard time. Her people do not understand her. If they saw her listening to the lark they would poke fun at her. She has never had the advantages of a good education, her people are so poor, but she would profit by her opportunity if she did, more than some people who have. You can tell by looking at her that she's intelligent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金在文章中写道：“这个姑娘正在倾听第一只云雀的歌声。她知道春天已经来到。她十七八岁。她家里很穷，所以她从来没有去过别的地方。冬天一到，她会穿上木头鞋子。她的样子好像在吹口哨，但是她并不想欺骗那只小鸟说她已经听到了歌声。其实，她家的其他人就在她的身后，正在朝田野这边走来，但是我们却看不见他们。除了她的父母，她还有两位兄弟。他们一辈子都在辛勤劳动。小姑娘是家里最小的孩子。她想到别的地方去瞧瞧。有时候她能听见开往巴黎的火车汽笛声，她这一辈子还没有坐过火车。她很想去巴黎，她想穿新衣服，她想去旅行。或许她想到美国来过一种新的生活，因为美国是个充满机会的国家。这个姑娘很苦，她的家人并不了解她的心思。他们要是看见她倾听云雀的歌唱，一定会取笑她的。她家里实在太穷了，所以她没有接受过良好的教育。但如果她接受了良好的教育，她一定会比别人受益更多。从她的模样就能看出她非常聪明。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I wasn't there but I was thinking of being there and coming up the path at that very moment -- I've got news for you he said -- who do you suppose I saw today -- why, I've no idea, I said -- why old Professor Truman -- he came rushing up to me in town and said, see here: where's Eliza -- I've got a job for her if she wants it, teaching school this winter out on Beaverdam -- why, pshaw, said your grandfather, she's never taught school a day in her life -- and Professor Truman laughed just as big as you please and said never you mind about that -- Eliza can do anything she sets her mind on -- well sir, that's the way it all came about."

<div class="line_en">Mr. Leonard had leased an old prewar house, set on a hill wooded by magnificent trees. It faced west and south, looking toward Biltburn, and abruptly down on South End, and the negro flats that stretched to the depot. One day early in September he took Eugene there. They walked across town, talking weightily of politics, across the Square, down Hatton Avenue, south into Church, and southwesterly along the bending road that ended in the schoolhouse on the abutting hill. The huge trees made sad autumn music as they entered the grounds. In the broad hall of the squat rambling old house Eugene for the first time saw Margaret Leonard. She held a broom in her hands, and was aproned. But his first impression was of her shocking fragility.</div>

<div class="line_en">Margaret Leonard at this time was thirty-four years old. She had borne two children, a son who was now six years old, and a daughter who was two. As she stood there, with her long slender fingers splayed about the broomstick, he noted, with a momentary cold nausea, that the tip of her right index finger was flattened out as if it had been crushed beyond healing by a hammer. But it was years before he knew that tuberculars sometimes have such fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时玛格丽特·伦纳德34岁，有两个孩子：儿子6岁，女儿才两岁。她站在那儿，细长的手指握着扫帚把。尤金注意到，她右手食指的指尖是扁平的，就像被铁锤砸伤以后再也难以恢复的样子。尤金看后觉得很不舒服。但是直到多年以后他才明白，肺结核病人的手指常常就是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As his mind groped out of the pain of impression he heard her voice and, still feeling within him the strange convulsive shame, he lifted his eyes to her face. It was the most tranquil and the most passionate face he had ever seen. The skin was sallow with a dead ashen tinge; beneath, the delicate bone-carving of face and skull traced itself clearly: the cadaverous tightness of those who are about to die had been checked. She had won her way back just far enough to balance carefully in the scales of disease and recovery. It was necessary for her to measure everything she did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当他沉浸在初次见面的印象中时，忽听见她说话的声音，他内心虽有某种羞耻的感觉，但还是抬头看着她的脸。这是一张他见过的最安闲、最热情的脸庞了。菜色的皮肤上面罩着一层死灰色；下面透着清晰的面部线条，但却不同于那些生命将死之人的苍白。她好像是一个业已复原的病人，状态不好也不坏，但是她的每个动作都必须非常谨慎小心。">查看中文翻译</div>

As the giddiness of his embarrassment wore off he saw that she could not weigh more than eighty or ninety pounds. He had heard of the children. Now he remembered them, and Leonard's white muscular bulk, with a sense of horror. His swift vision leaped at once to the sexual relation, and something in him twisted aside, incredulous and afraid.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her thin face was given a touch of shrewdness and decision by the straight line of her nose, the fine long carving of her chin. Beneath the sallow minute pitted skin in her cheeks, and about her mouth, several frayed nerve-centres twitched from moment to moment, jarring the skin slightly without contorting or destroying the passionate calm beauty that fed her inexhaustibly from within. This face was the constant field of conflict, nearly always calm, but always reflecting the incessant struggle and victory of the enormous energy that inhabited her, over the thousand jangling devils of depletion and weariness that tried to pull her apart. There was always written upon her the epic poetry of beauty and repose out of struggle -- he never ceased to feel that she had her hand around the reins of her heart, that gathered into her grasp were all the straining wires and sinews of disunion which would scatter and unjoint her members, once she let go. Literally, physically, he felt that, the great tide of valiance once flowed out of her, she would immediately go to pieces. She was like some great general, famous, tranquil, wounded unto death, who, with his fingers clamped across a severed artery, stops for an hour the ebbing of his life -- sends on the battle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她瘦小的脸庞因高挺的鼻子和秀长的下巴透出一丝精明和果断。她的两颊和嘴边蜡黄的皮肤有时候神经质般地微微抖动着，但是这却无损于从她内心源源不断涌现出的热情和平静之美。她的脸差不多总是平静的，但也能看出她内心巨大的能量不断地和疲劳的神经进行着斗争，并力图克服这个可怕的敌人，不让它瓦解自己。她脸上的表情时刻书写着一部有关美与沉着的伟大史诗——他每次见到她总会产生这种感觉：她的那双手永远紧握着她心头的血管，她就像握着一股绞在一起的电线和分裂的肌肉，一旦松开手，它们就会四分五裂。她切身感觉到，她体内的这些巨大的勇气一旦散失掉，她就会马上崩溃。她就像疆场上率领千军万马冲锋陷阵的将军，虽然声名远扬但却镇定自若。她虽然身负致命的重伤，但仍然用手堵住血流如注的伤口，继续作战。">查看中文翻译</div>

The voice had in it that quality of quiet wonder that he had sometimes heard in the voices of people who had seen or were told of some strange event, or coincidence, that seemed to reach beyond life, beyond nature -- a note of acceptance; and suddenly he knew that all life seemed eternally strange to this woman, that she looked directly into the beauty and the mystery and the tragedy in the hearts of men, and that he seemed beautiful to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hair was coarse and dull-brown, fairly abundant, tinged lightly with gray: it was combed evenly in the middle and bound tightly in a knot behind. Everything about her was very clean, like a scrubbed kitchen board: she took his hand, he felt the firm nervous vitality of her fingers, and he noticed how clean and scrubbed her thin somewhat labor-worn hands were. If he noticed her emaciation at all now, it was only with a sense of her purification: he felt himself in union not with disease, but with the greatest health he had ever known. She made a high music in him. His heart lifted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her face darkened with the strange passionate vitality that left no print, that lived there bodiless like life; her brown eyes darkened into black as if a bird had flown through them and left the shadow of its wings. She saw his small remote face burning strangely at the end of his long unfleshed body, she saw the straight thin shanks, the big feet turned awkwardly inward, the dusty patches on his stockings at the knees, and his thin wristy arms that stuck out painfully below his cheap ill-fitting jacket; she saw the thin hunched line of his shoulders, the tangled mass of hair -- and she did not laugh.</div>

She was excited and eager -- she saw at once how abundantly she could feed this ravenous hunger for knowledge, experience, wisdom. And he knew suddenly the joy of obedience: the wild ignorant groping, the blind hunt, the desperate baffled desire was now to be ruddered, guided, controlled. The way through the passage to India, that he had never been able to find, would now be charted for him.

<div class="line_en">He was drowned deep at midnight in the destiny of the man who killed the bear, the burner of windmills and the scourge of banditry, in all the life of road and tavern in the Middle Ages, in valiant and beautiful Gerard, the seed of genius, the father of Erasmus. Eugene thought The Cloister and the Hearth the best story he had ever read.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，他依然沉浸在猎熊人的命运里，沉浸在火烧风车、鞭笞贼寇、中世纪游记和旅店的生活中，沉浸在骁勇、英俊的杰拉德身上，他是伊拉兹马斯之父、天才之种。尤金觉得《寺院和家庭》是他读过的最棒的一部故事书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the cruel volcano of the boy's mind, the little brier moths of his idolatry wavered in to their strange marriage and were consumed. One by one the merciless years reaped down his gods and captains. What had lived up to hope? What had withstood the scourge of growth and memory? Why had the gold become so dim? All of his life, it seemed, his blazing loyalties began with men and ended with images; the life he leaned on melted below his weight, and looking down, he saw he clasped a statue; but enduring, a victorious reality amid his shadow-haunted heart, she remained, who first had touched his blinded eyes with light, who nested his hooded houseless soul. She remained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个孩子的心肠就像残忍的火山，以往轻易崇拜过的偶像投入其中就像飞蛾一样顷刻间化成了灰烬。随着岁月的流逝，他过去心目中的英雄豪杰一个个先后消逝。还有什么希望呢？还有什么能经得起成长和记忆的考验呢？过去弥足珍贵的事物为何变得微不足道？他的一生中似乎已经注定，那些他曾经笃信崇拜的人最终都变成了一幅幅肖像；他最为信赖的生活却在他的脚下融化瓦解；他俯身向下望去，看见自己紧紧地抱着一尊雕像。但是在他阴影笼罩的心坎上只有她是永恒的，是真实的胜利；正是她让他失明的双目重现光明，是她让他无家可归的心灵有了温暖的港湾。她永存在他的心底。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">O death in life that turns our men to stone! O change that levels down our gods! If only one lives yet, above the cinders of the consuming years, shall not this dust awaken, shall not dead faith revive, shall we not see God again, as once in morning, on the mountain? Who walks with us on the hills?</div>
