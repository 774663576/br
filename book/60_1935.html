<div class="line_en">The secret police have several functions, my dear, he began in an avuncular tone. The first is the classical one. They keep an ear out for what people are saying and report it to their superiors.</div>

<div class="line_en">The second function is intimidatory. They want to make it seem as if they have us in their power; they want us to be afraid. That is what your bald-headed friend was after.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二是威慑的职责。他们要让我们明白我们时刻被他们所控制，他们要我们害怕。那个秃头就想这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ambassador positioned himself on the cot by folding his legs under his body, as he had learned to do in yoga class. Kennedy, beaming down on him from the frame on the wall, gave his words a special consecration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大使盘腿坐在沙发上，就像瑜伽课上教过的那副架势。墙壁上，肯尼迪在微笑着，仿佛在对他的话给予一种认可。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The third function consists of staging situations that will compromise us. Gone are the days when they tried to accuse us of plotting the downfall of the state. That would only increase our popularity. Now they slip hashish in our pockets or claim we've raped a twelve-year-old girl. They can always dig up some girl to back them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第三项职责是制造能加罪于我们的情形。如今，要是控告我们阴谋颠覆国家。他们已无利可图，因为这样做，只会为我们引来更多的同情。他们更想达到的，是设法在我们的兜里搜到大麻，或是证明我们强奸了一个十二岁的小女孩。要找到一个小女孩来作证，他们总有法子的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They need to trap people, the ambassador went on, to force them to collaborate and set other traps for other people, so that gradually they can turn the whole nation into a single organization of informers.</div>

<div class="line_en">How could she have missed it? The flat was so odd, and he didn't belong there at all! Why would an elegantly dressed engineer live in a miserable place like that? Was he an engineer? And if so, how could he leave work at two in the afternoon? Besides, how many engineers read Sophocles? No, that was no engineer's library! The whole place had more the flavor of a flat confiscated from a poor imprisoned intellectual. Her father was put in prison when she was ten, and the state had confiscated their flat and all her father's books. Who knows to what use the flat had then been put?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她怎么没有想到呢？那住宅一直有点什么不对劲，完全不像那家伙住的地方。一个穿着体面的工程师，怎么会住在那么简陋的一间房子里？他真是工程师吗？如果真是，他怎么能够下午两点钟不上班？难以想象一个工程师竟然读《俄狄浦斯》！不，那不是一个工程师的书架！倒像是一个穷困潦倒的知识分子的住所，如今把他投进监狱，这房子给没收了。她十岁时，他们就把她父亲给抓走了，还把房子连同书架全给没收了。谁知道那房子后来派了什么用场？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tereza could think of nothing but the possibility that the engineer had been sent by the police. And who was that strange boy who drank himself silly and told her he loved her? It was because of him that the bald police spy had launched into her and the engineer stood up for her. So all three had been playing parts in a prearranged scenario meant to soften her up for the seduction!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎心里只琢磨着一件事：工程师肯定是警察派到她身边来的。还有那个跑到对面小酒馆喝得醉醺醺，然后又回来向她表白的奇怪男孩，又是什么人？就是因为那个男孩，警察才找她的碴儿，才有工程师出来为她抱不平。他们三个合伙演了一场精心准备好的戏。那个男人对她表示同情，任务就是引诱她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now she saw clearly why the engineer had never returned: he had accomplished his mission. What mission? The drunken undercover agent had inadvertently given it away when he said, Just remember that prostitution is a criminal offense. Now that self-styled engineer would testify that she had slept with him and demanded to be paid! They would threaten to blow it up into a scandal unless she agreed to report on the people who got drunk in her bar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，她明白了他为什么一直没有再来。他已经完成了任务。什么任务？那个警察说：“别忘了，如今我们这儿禁止卖淫！”他是因为有点醉了，不觉中泄露了底细。到时，那个假工程师会出来作证，证明他跟她上了床，问他要了钱！他们会拿这桩丑事来威胁她，逼她告发来酒吧喝酒的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
