<div class="line_en">Ball-of-Fat and Cornudet, although nearest the door, were the last to descend, grave and haughty before the enemy. The fat girl tried to control herself and be calm. The democrat waved a tragic hand and his long beard seemed to tremble a little and grow redder. They wished to preserve their dignity, comprehending that in such meetings as these they represented in some degree their great country, and somewhat disgusted with the docility of her companions, the fat girl tried to show more pride than her neighbors, the honest women, and, as she felt that some one should set an example, she continued her attitude of resistance assumed at the beginning of the journey.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two good sisters were the first to obey, with the docility of saints accustomed ever to submission. The Count and Countess then appeared, followed by the manufacturer and his wife; then Loiseau, pushing ahead of him his larger half. The last-named, as he set foot on the earth, said to the officer:"Good evening, sir,"more as a measure of prudence than politeness. The officer, insolent as all powerful people usually are, looked at him without a word.</div>

<div class="line_en">They entered the vast kitchen of the inn, and the German, having demanded their traveling papers signed by the General-in-chief (in which the name, the description, and profession of each traveler was mentioned), and having examined them all critically, comparing the people and their signatures, said:"It is quite right,"and went out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人都走到旅馆的宽大的厨房里了，日耳曼人教他们出示了那份由总司令签了名的出境证，那上面是载着每一个旅客的姓名，年貌和职业的，他长久地端详着这一行人，把他们本人和书面记载来作比较。随后他突然说道：“这对的。”接着他走开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally, they sat down at table, when the proprietor of the inn himself appeared. He was a former horse merchant, a large, asthmatic man, with a constant wheezing and rattling in his throat. His father had left him the name of Follenvie. He asked:</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they breathed. They were still hungry and supper was ordered. A half hour was necessary to pre-pare it, and while two servants were attending to this they went to their rooms. They found them along a corridor which terminated in a large glazed door.</div>

<div class="line_en">A stir was felt around her; each discussed and tried to think of the cause of this order. The Count approached her, saying:</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are wrong, Madame, for your refusal may lead to considerable difficulty, not only for yourself, but for all your companions. It is never worth while to resist those in power. This request cannot assuredly bring any danger; it is, without doubt, about some forgotten formality."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您错了，夫人，因为您的拒绝是能够引起种种重大困难的，不仅对于您自己，而且甚至对于您的全体旅伴也一样。人总是从来不应当和最强的人作对的。他这种要求确实不能引起任何危险；无疑地是为了一点儿漏了的手续。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All gathered around to learn something, but she said nothing; and when the Count insisted, she responded with great dignity:"No, it does not concern you; I can say nothing."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they all seated themselves around a high soup tureen, whence came the odor of cabbage. In spite of alarm, the supper was gay. The cider was good, the beverage Loiseau and the good sisters took as a means of economy. The others called for wine; Cornudet demanded beer. He had a special fashion of uncorking the bottle, making froth on the liquid, carefully filling the glass and then holding it before the light to better appreciate the color. When he drank, his great beard, which still kept some of the foam of his beloved beverage, seemed to tremble with tenderness; his eyes were squinted, in order not to lose sight of his tipple, and he had the unique air of fulfilling the function for which he was born. One would say that there was in his mind a meeting, like that of affinities, between the two great passions that occupied his life-Pale Ale and Revolutions; and assuredly he could not taste the one without thinking of the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是大家围着一个高大的汤罐坐下了，其中有一阵卷心白菜的香味散出来。他们固然受了惊慌，不过这顿宵夜却是快乐的。苹果酒的味道不错，由于省钱，鸟家两夫妇和两个嬷嬷都喝着它。其余的人叫的都是葡萄酒；戈尔弩兑叫的是啤酒。他有一套特别的方式去开酒瓶，去让酒吐出泡沫，偏着杯子去细看，接着就举在眼睛和灯光的中间去玩赏它的颜色。在他喝的时候，他那一丛大胡子本来保存了这种他心爱的饮料的色彩，现在竟像是因为受到爱抚而颤抖起来；他斜着眼光盯着他的杯子，仿佛这样就尽到了他今生今世的唯一职责。他毕生只有两件大的癖好：一件是浅颜色啤酒，而另一件是革命，竟可以说他心里想使这两件癖好能够彼此接近，并且能够彼此交融如同水乳似的，所以他确实不能尝着这一件的滋味而不念及另一件。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at the end of ten minutes she reappeared, out of breath, red to suffocation, and exasperated. She stammered:"Oh! the rascal; the rascal!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，10分钟以后，她回来了，脸上绯红，喘得连话都说不出，而且非常生气，她吃着嘴说道：“哈，混蛋！混蛋！”">查看中文翻译</div>
