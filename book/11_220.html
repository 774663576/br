<div class="line_en">The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood still, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Enter, good guests!" she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. But before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the lily-bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots. About her feel in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在房间的另一边，一名女子坐在面对大门的椅子上。她有着一头丰润及肩的金色秀发，身上穿着翠绿色的长裙，长裙上点缀着如同露珠一样闪闪发亮的银线。她系着一条黄金打造的腰带，上面雕刻着精细的荷花，间或装饰着勿忘我草的蓝色花一心。她的脚边放着许多绿色和土色的容器，里面浮着美丽的荷花；一时之间，众人有种她漂浮在荷花池内的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and smiled. "Fair lady Goldberry!" said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. "Fair lady Goldberry!" he said again. "Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人纷纷吃惊的看着她，金莓则是对每个人报以慷慨的笑容。“美丽的金莓小姐！”佛罗多觉得自己内心中满了无法理解的愉悦。他脑中一片空白，如同被精灵的美丽乐音所迷惑一般；但这次他所着的魔咒是完全不同的类型，这愉悦没有那么超凡出尘，却更贴近凡夫俗子，更撼动人心，虽美妙但不疏离。“美丽的金莓小姐！”他只能挤出这几个字来。“我们刚刚所听见的歌声中原来竟藏着这么美丽的暗示！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come dear folk!" she said, taking Frodo by the hand. "Laugh and be merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River." Then lightly she passed them and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread out across it. "Let us shut out the night!" she said. "For you are still afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“诸位不要客气嘛！”她握住佛罗多的手说。“高兴一点，开怀大笑吧！我是河之女金莓。”接着，她步履轻盈的一转，倒退着将大门关上。“让我们把黑夜关在外面吧！”她说，“看来你们依旧对树影、深水和野性生物余悸犹存。别再害怕！因为今晚你们在汤姆—庞巴迪的庇护之下。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught, among many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人老实不客气的在铺有软垫的椅子上坐了下来，同时每双眼睛都目不转睛的看着忙进忙出的金莓；她优雅的如同舞蹈一般的动作让每个人都觉得满心欢喜。屋后传来了另外一个歌声。在“叮铃当叮啦、快乐的啦”和“罗哈哈”之间，他们可以听见有几句话不断的重复着：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Welcome!" she said. "I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so sweet-tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait for the Master of the house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired beasts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“欢迎！”她说。“我没想到夏尔的客人如此舌灿莲花。不过，我从你眼中的光芒和歌中的语调听的出来你是精灵之友。这真是让人欢欣无比！请先就座，等我们家的主人回来！他正在照顾你们疲倦的马儿，应该马上就好了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo looked at her questioningly. "He is, as you have seen him," she said in answer to his look. "He is the Master of wood, water, and hill."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="另一扇门咿呀一声打了开来，汤姆跟着走进房内。他的帽子已经脱了下来，浓密的褐发现在像是秋天满地的红叶一样乱糟糟的。他笑着走向金莓，握住她的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No indeed!" she answered, and her smile faded. "That would indeed be a burden," she added in a low voice, as if to herself. "The trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不是！”她的笑容渐渐隐去。“这是太沉重的负担了，”她彷佛自言自语的低声补充道。“所有生长于此、生活于此的花草和树木都拥有自主权。汤姆—庞巴迪只是主人。他没有恐惧，不管在白天黑夜，他都可以自由自在的走在林中、水边和山上，没有任何力量能够干涉他。汤姆—庞巴迪是主人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here's my pretty lady!" he said, bowing to the hobbits. "Here's my Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle! Is the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter; milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for us? Is the supper ready?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping roof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). Its walls were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside each bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他打开一扇门，让众人跟着他沿着一条短短的走道前进，接着走道转了个直角的弯，让他们来到有个低斜屋顶的房间中。（看来这似乎是在屋子北面所盖的小阁楼）。房间的墙壁是由整齐的石块所砌成的，但上面还挂着许多绿色的挂毯和黄色的廉幕。地上铺着石板和新鲜的绿色灯心草。除此之外，地板上还有四块厚厚的踏垫，每个垫子旁边都堆着高高的白色毯子。在另一方的墙边则有个放满了宽大陶土盆的的长板凳，板凳旁边放着许多装满清水的罐子。有些罐子的水冰冰凉凉的，有些则是冒着蒸汽。房间中的床边都放着绿色的软拖鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the table, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry and the Master. It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking-bowls seemed to be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过不了多久，哈比人都已经梳洗完毕，两两对坐的在餐桌旁坐了下来，长桌的两边则是金莓和主人的位置。这顿饭吃的很久、很愉快。虽然饿坏的哈比人们狼吞虎咽，但桌上的菜肴怎么吃都吃不完。他们的碗内盛着的似乎是清水，却如同美酒一样让他们身心舒畅，心情轻松。这些小客人们突然间意识到自己竟然高高兴兴的唱了起来，彷佛这比说话更为自然。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have peace now," she said, "until the morning! Heed no nightly noises! For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top.

<div class="line_cn" title="“安心的睡，”她说，“一觉睡到天亮！别担心有任何声音吵你们！除了月光、星光和晚风之外，没有任何事物可以通过这里的门窗。晚安！”她光彩四射的走出房间。她的脚步声在众人耳中听起来如同沿着山坡缓缓流入夜色中的溪水般悦耳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The guests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth before them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in the room were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle; and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="酒足饭饱之后，汤姆和金莓开始收拾桌子。每位客人都奉命乖乖的坐在位子上，将疲倦的双脚翘在小凳子上休息。他们眼前的壁炉内燃着温暖的火焰，同时还发出甜美的香气，彷佛燃烧的是最高级的苹果木。在一切收拾妥当后，主人们将屋中所有灯火熄灭，只剩下壁炉上左右两边各点一对蜡烛和油灯。这时，金莓才拿着蜡烛站在他们面前，向每个人道晚安，祝他们有个好梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

Just chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine, though I was waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you were wandering. We guessed you'd come ere long down to the water: all paths lead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he's a mighty singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom had an errand there, that he dared not hinder." Tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice:</div>

<div class="line_en">In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood the figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed and the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. "Black Riders!" thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had waked, and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: tip-tap, squeak: the noise was like branches fretting in the wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: "Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!" Then he went to sleep again.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. "I shall be drowned!" he thought. It will find its way in, and then I shall drown." He felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his fool on the corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was and lay down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: "Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top." A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep and fell asleep again.</div>

He had half expected to see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a pale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.</div>

There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows; the valley of the Withywindle. The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows.

<div class="line_en">Needless to say -- not that Tom's threat sounded very serious -- the hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and singing here and there outside. The room looked westward over the mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled.</div>

They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing. The thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed now that they would not go further that day.</div>

Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water.

Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain -- and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots.

<div class="line_en">As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest, apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more than enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom's words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs.</div>

They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks. Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young Sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. There was victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were stirred in the mounds. Barrow-wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind." Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="窗外似乎掠过一道陰影，哈比人们急忙转过头察看。当他们转回头时，浑身沐浴在光芒中的金莓就站在门口。她一手拿着蜡烛，一手护着蜡烛的火焰；蜡烛的光芒彷佛陽光照在白云上一般从她细白的指缝间流泄出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance, neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom bowed to his guests. "Supper is ready," said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes' mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had green stockings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快就拿回一个又大又重的拖盘。两人接着又开始忙碌的布置餐桌。哈比人们又惊又喜的看着：金莓的一举手一投足都带着莫名的优雅，而汤姆的怪诞行径又是那么的欢欣鼓舞。即使如此，这两人的行动一如双人舞般配合的天衣无缝，对彼此丝毫没有妨碍。他们进进出出，绕着桌子行走，很快的就将食物、饮料跟照明布置好了。桌面上放置着许多黄色或是白色的蜡烛。汤姆向客人一鞠躬。“晚餐已备妥，”金莓说。哈比人们这才注意到她现在穿着一身银色的衣服，腰间是条白色的腰带，而鞋子则如同鱼鳞一样闪闪发亮。汤姆则是一身劲蓝，配着脚上的绿袜子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The rain has ended," she said; "and new waters are running downhill, under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雨已经停了，”她说，“小溪也在星光下潺潺的奔流着。我们该高兴起来，大声欢笑！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And let us have food and drink!" cried Tom. "Long tales are thirsty. And long listening's hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!" With that he jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大伙还是赶快大吃大喝吧！”汤姆跟着大喊道。“这么长的故事让我口渴了。从早听到晚也该让人饥肠辘辘吧！”话一说完，他就从壁炉上取下蜡烛，从金莓的蜡烛上引火，一溜烟的跳出门外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在用完晚餐之后，金莓和他们合唱了许多首歌。这些歌曲的旋律从山顶欢乐的开始，温柔的潺潺流下，以若有所失的沉默做结。在这沉默中，他们眼前似乎浮现了无比清澈深邃的池水，天空的倒影和星辰在水面上闪动着宝石般的光芒。最后，如同前晚一样，她又再一次的向每个人道晚安，留下他们坐在炉火前。唯一不同的是，汤姆这次看来十分清醒，一连串问了他们许多问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of Tom's words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing or even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这顿晚餐甚至比前一顿还要丰富。在汤姆魔幻般的说书技巧之下，他们错过了很多顿饭；不过，当食物一上桌，他们腹里的馋虫就立刻醒了过来，让他们饿的如同一周没吃饭一样。这次他们专心一致的埋头苦干，没时间分神唱歌或是交谈。过了不久之后，他们才心满意足的开始大声谈笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imagined. "There's earth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open," said Tom. It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他似乎已经对他们的背景和家世了若指掌，甚至连他们在夏尔都不怎么记得的过往都一清二楚。他们对此并不感到惊讶，不过，对方也不隐瞒这都是从农夫马嘎身上知道的。而且，汤姆对这个人的看重超乎他们的想像。“他脚踏实地，手上沾着泥土，看过大风大浪，双眼也警醒的很，”汤姆说。很明显的，汤姆也和精灵打过交道；不知透过什么方式，他似乎也从吉尔多那边知道了佛罗多的行踪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当戒指放在他那双褐色的大手上时，似乎突然间增大许多。他将这戒指猛然举到眼前，开始哈哈大笑。有那么短短的一瞬间，哈比人们看到了一个让人不知该放松还是该担心的景象：他那蓝色的眼睛从戒指中闪动着异样的光芒。接着，汤姆将戒指对着烛火，把小指插进去。哈比人一时之间没有发现到有任何的变化，随即，他们都倒抽了一口冷气，汤姆竟然没有隐形。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air -- and it vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry -- and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆又再度大笑，将戒指往上一抛；它在一阵闪光中消失了。佛罗多低呼一声，汤姆靠向前，微笑着将戒指交还给他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Show me the precious Ring!" he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆真的知道很多，而他的问题更是刁钻直接；佛罗多发现自己对他透露了许多甚至没在甘道夫面前说出的恐惧和想法。汤姆不停的点头，当他听见黑骑士的时候眼中隐隐闪动着光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not see him. He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里转过头准备要和他说些什么，脸上却露出十分惊讶的表情。佛罗多觉得蛮高兴的：这的确是他的戒指，因为梅里一脸惊慌的瞪着他的位子，似乎什么也看不见。他站起来，悄悄远离壁炉，走向大门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked the same and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways -- then he slipped the Ring on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多仔细的看着那戒指，心中有些怀疑（就像是把珠宝借给魔术师的人一样）。是同样的一枚戒指，至少外表和重量感觉起来是一样的。魔戒每次在佛罗多手中都会让他觉得格外沉重。不过，似乎有什么力量让他想要额外再确认一下。他似乎对于汤姆将甘道夫视若珍宝的魔戒等闲视之感到有些不高兴。随着谈话的继续，他一直想找个机会测试一下这宝物。汤姆正好在描述森林中野獾的行为，他立刻抓准机会把魔戒套上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey there!" cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes. "Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom Bombadil's not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand's more fair without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me! We must talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom must teach the right road, and keep your feet from wandering."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿！等等！”汤姆的双眼闪动着逼人的精光。“嘿！佛罗多，喂！你要去哪里？汤姆—庞巴迪可还没有老到眼睛看不见哪！拿下你的金戒指！你的双手没有那戒指会更漂亮些。快回来！别闹了，乖乖的坐在我身边！我们得要再多谈些，好好想想明早该怎么办。汤姆得要告诉你们要怎么走，免得又迷路了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful. But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. "I am no weather-master," he said; "nor is aught that goes on two legs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多笑了（他试着觉得好过一些），脱下了魔戒，坐回原来的位置上。汤姆现在告诉他们，他认为明天将会出太陽，会是个很晴朗的早晨，非常适合赶路。不过，他们明天得要一早就走，因为附近的天气连汤姆都不太有把握，可能瞬息数变。“我可不是天气预报大师，”他说，“两条腿走路的家伙都不应该有这种能耐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house, over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope in that way to strike the East Road in a day's journey, and avoid the Barrows. He told them not to be afraid -- but to mind their own business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他的建议之下，一行人决定从他的住所往北走，沿着西边较为低矮的山岗前进。如此一来，他们可能在一天之内就可以踏上东方大道，也可以避开古墓。他告诉他们不要多想，只管赶路就好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Keep to the green grass. Don't you go a-meddling with old stone or cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter!" He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走在草地上。千万别和那些岩石、尸妖打交道，更别打搅它们的居所，除非你们的胆子大的跟熊一样！”这句话他强调了不只一次，更建议他们万一不慎靠近这地方，最好从西边越过这些古墓。然后，他还教导他们一个曲调，如果第二天遇到不幸的状况时就要立刻唱出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
