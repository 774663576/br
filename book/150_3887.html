<div class="line_en">Mrs. Garstin was a hard, cruel, managing, ambitious, parsimonious, and stupid woman. She was the daughter, one of five, of a solicitor in Liverpool, and Bernard Garstin had met her when he was on the Northern Circuit. He had seemed then a young man of promise and her father said he would go far. He hadn't. He was painstaking, industrious, and capable, but he had not the will to advance himself. Mrs. Garstin despised him. But she recognized, though with bitterness, that she could only achieve success through him, and she set herself to drive him on the way she desired to go. She nagged him without mercy. She discovered that if she wanted him to do something which his sensitiveness revolted against she had only to give him no peace and eventually, exhausted, he would yield. On her side she set herself to cultivate the people who might be useful. She flattered the solicitors who would send her husband briefs and was familiar with their wives. She was obsequious to the judges and their ladies. She made much of promising politicians.</div>

<div class="line_en">In twenty-five years Mrs. Garstin never invited any one to dine at her house because she liked him. She gave large dinner parties at regular intervals. But parsimony was as strong in her as ambition. She hated to spend money. She flattered herself that she could make as much show as any one else at half the price. Her dinners were long and elaborate, but thrifty, and she could never persuade herself that people when they were eating and talking knew what they drank. She wrapped sparkling Moselle in a napkin and thought her guests took it for champagne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二十五年来，凡是贾斯汀夫人邀请至府上的客人，无一是因博得她个人的好感而获此荣幸。每隔一段时间她就要举行隆重的晚宴。然而她的吝啬丝毫不逊于她的野心。她对花钱深恶痛绝，自诩仅用一半的钱就能办出同样豪华的晚会。她家的晚宴时间冗长，花样繁多，但却节俭之极，她自信客人们在边享用主菜边高谈阔论之时，决不会注意他们喝的是什么。她把带沫摩泽尔葡萄酒瓶用餐巾包裹起来，以为客人们就会把它当香槟酒喝了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bernard Garstin had a fair though not a large practice. Men who had been called after him had long outstripped him. Mrs. Garstin made him stand for parliament. The expense of the election was borne by the party, but here again her parsimony balked her ambition, and she could not bring herself to spend enough money to nurse the constituency. The subscriptions Bernard Garstin made to the innumerable funds a candidate is expected to contribute to were always just a little less than adequate. He was beaten. Though it would have pleased Mrs. Garstin to be a member's wife she bore her disappointment with fortitude. The fact of her husband's standing had brought her in contact with a number of prominent persons and she appreciated the addition to her social consequence. She knew that Bernard would never make his mark in the House. She wanted him to be a member only that he might have a claim on the gratitude of his party, and surely to fight two or three losing seats would give him that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯纳德·贾斯汀的业务还算不错，但远非顾客盈门。许多后起之秀早已超过了他。于是贾斯汀夫人便要他参加议会选举。竞选费用靠党内成员大家共同出资，但她秉性里的吝啬再次压倒了野心，从不想出足够的钱。这样，庞大的竞选基金里面，伯纳德·贾斯汀出的钱总是比作为参选人所理应出的少那么一点点，结果他落选了。贾斯汀夫人吞食了苦果，然而竞选人妻子的身份却让她高兴。丈夫的参选使她得以认识了诸多杰出人物，社会地位的提高让她喜出望外。她明白伯纳德根本进不了议会，她只是想借机赚取党内的几分感激之情，这样让伯纳德以两三票之差落选是再合适不过了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he was still a junior and many younger men than he had already taken silk. It was necessary that he should too, not only because otherwise he could scarcely hope to be made a judge, but on her account also; it mortified her to go in to dinner after women ten years younger than herself. But here she encountered in her husband an obstinacy which she had not for years been accustomed to. He was afraid that as а К. C. he would get no work. A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush, he told her, to which she retorted that a proverb was the last refuge of the mentally destitute. He suggested to her the possibilty that his income would be halved and he knew that there was no argument which could have greater weight with her. She would not listen. She called him pusillanimous. She gave him no peace and at last, as always, he yielded. He applied for silk and it was promptly awarded him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而他依然是一位低等律师，而他的许多后辈俨然已经成为御用律师。她觉得他必须朝这个目标努力，否则根本没希望当上法官。另外他的妻子正在为不得不和比她年轻十岁的女人共赴晚宴而苦恼不已，就算是为了她，他也应该如此。但多年来她第一次遭到了他的反抗。他担忧升为王室顾问律师会使生意减少，一鸟在手，胜于二鸟在林。她反唇相讥称谚语只是他的最后一招，只能说明他已理屈词穷。他让她想想要是收入减半了会怎么样，这肯定是她最要命的事。她依然不听。她叫他懦夫，让他不得安宁。最终，他一如既往地屈服了。他申请担任御用律师，很快便获得了准许。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His misgivings were justified. He made no headway as a leader and his briefs were few. But he concealed any disappointment he may have felt, and if he reproached his wife it was in his heart. He grew perhaps a little more silent, but he had always been silent at home, and no one in his family noticed a change in him. His daughters had never looked upon him as anything but a source of income; it had always seemed perfectly natural that he should lead a dog's life in order to provide them with board and lodging, clothes, holidays and money for odds and ends; and now, understanding that through his fault money was less plentiful, the indifference they had felt for him was tinged with an exasperated contempt. It never occurred to them to ask themselves what were the feelings of the subdued little man who went out early in the morning and came home at night only in time to dress for dinner. He was a stranger to them, but because he was their father they took it for granted that he should love and cherish them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的担心应验了。他在高级律师的位置上毫无进展，而上门的生意也屈指可数。但他不再掩饰心里的失望之情，对妻子若心有不快，便敢于出口责备。他在家大概话比以前少了一点，然而他一贯少言寡语，谁也没注意到他身上这点变化。他的女儿们只当他是全家的衣食来源，为了她们吃好住暖、游玩取乐，他理应做牛做马。如今因为他的过错，钱来得比以前少了，除了对他漠不关心外，她们心里对他又多了一层埋怨和蔑视。她们从未想过这位顺从的矮小男人心里想的是什么。他起早出门，夜晚准时回家换衣就餐。他对她们来说是个陌生人，但他是她们的父亲，自然应当爱她们，疼着她们。">查看中文翻译</div>
