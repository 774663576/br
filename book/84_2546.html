<div class="line_en">My apartment was a mile south of campus. It had a kitchen, living room and three small bedrooms. The other women who lived there -- I knew they would be women because at BYU all housing was segregated by gender -- had not yet returned from the Christmas holiday. It took only a few minutes to bring in my stuff from the car. Mother and I stood awkwardly in the kitchen for a moment, then she hugged me and drove away.</div>

<div class="line_en">On New Year's Day, Mother drove me to my new life. I didn't take much with me: a dozen jars of home-canned peaches, bedding, and a garbage bag full of clothes. As we sped down the interstate I watched the landscape splinter and barb, the rolling black summits of the Bear River Mountains giving way to the razor-edged Rockies. The university was nestled in the heart of the Wasatch Mountains, whose white massifs jutted mightily out of the earth. They were beautiful, but to me their beauty seemed aggressive, menacing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="元旦那天，母亲开车送我去往新生活。我没带多少东西：一打自制桃罐头、床上用品、一塑料袋衣服。车子沿州际高速公路疾驰而下时，我望着支离破碎的风景，贝尔河山脉连绵起伏的黑色群峰逐渐被棱角分明的落基山脉所取代。大学坐落在瓦萨奇山脉的中心地带，那里的白色山峦拔地而起。它们很美，但在我看来，它们的美丽咄咄逼人，令人生畏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I lived alone in the quiet apartment for three days. Except it wasn't quiet. Nowhere was quiet. I'd never spent more than a few hours in a city and found it impossible to defend myself from the strange noises that constantly invaded. The chirrup of crosswalk signals, the shrieking of sirens, the hissing of air brakes, even the hushed chatter of people strolling on the sidewalk -- I heard every sound individually. My ears, accustomed to the silence of the peak, felt battered by them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我独自一人在安静的公寓里待了三天。不过它并不安静。没有一个地方是安静的。我从未在一座城市里待过几个小时，我发现自己无力抵御不断袭来的奇怪噪音。人行道信号的吱喳声，警笛的尖叫声，气闸的嘶嘶声，甚至漫步在人行道上的行人的闲聊声——每一个声响都逃不过我的耳朵。我的耳朵，习惯了山间的寂静，被这些声音折磨得痛苦不堪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My other roommate arrived the next day. Her name was Mary and she was a junior studying early childhood education. She dressed like I expected a Mormon to dress on Sunday, in a floral skirt that reached to the floor. Her clothes were a kind of shibboleth to me; they signaled that she was not a gentile, and for a few hours I felt less alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天我的另一个室友到了。她叫玛丽，是大三学生，主修儿童早期教育。她穿着一条碎花及地长裙，与我所期待的摩门教徒的礼拜日穿着一样。她的衣服对我来说就像某种暗号，暗示她不是一个异教徒，有几个小时我觉得不那么孤独了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Until that evening. Mary stood suddenly from the sofa and said, "Classes start tomorrow. Time to stock up on groceries." She left and returned an hour later with two paper bags. Shopping was forbidden on the Sabbath -- I'd never purchased so much as a stick of gum on a Sunday -- but Mary casually unpacked eggs, milk and pasta without acknowledging that every item she was placing in our communal fridge was a violation of the Lord's Commandments. When she withdrew a can of Diet Coke, which my father said was a violation of the Lord's counsel for health, I again fled to my room.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, I got on the bus going the wrong direction. By the time I'd corrected my mistake, the lecture was nearly finished. I stood awkwardly in the back until the professor, a thin woman with delicate features, motioned for me to take the only available seat, which was near the front. I sat down, feeling the weight of everyone's eyes. The course was on Shakespeare, and I'd chosen it because I'd heard of Shakespeare and thought that was a good sign. But now I was here I realized I knew nothing about him. It was a word I'd heard, that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，我错上了反方向的公交车。等我换了方向到达时，课程差不多结束了。我局促不安地站在后面，直到教授——一个五官精致的瘦女人——示意我坐到前面唯一一个空座。我坐了下来，感受到每个人投来的目光所形成的压力。这是门关于莎士比亚的课，我选它是因为我听说过莎士比亚，觉得这是个好兆头。但现在我才意识到我对他一无所知。那只是我听过的一个名字，仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我困惑地盯着她。我当然不属于这里，但她是怎么知道的？我差一点就将整件事坦白交代——我从没上过学，并未达到高中毕业要求——这时她补充了一句：“这门课是为大四学生开的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went to the registrar's office, where I was told that every freshman-level course was full. What I should do, they said, was check online every few hours and join if someone dropped. By the end of the week I'd managed to squeeze into introductory courses in English, American history, music and religion, but I was stuck in a junior-level course on art in Western civilization.</div>

<div class="line_en">My next class, American history, was held in an auditorium named for the prophet Joseph Smith. I'd thought American history would be easy because Dad had taught us about the Founding Fathers -- I knew all about Washington, Jefferson, Madison.

<div class="line_en">In the first lecture, we were told that the next class would begin with a quiz on the readings. For two days I tried to wrestle meaning from the textbook's dense passages, but terms like "civic humanism" and "the Scottish Enlightenment" dotted the page like black holes, sucking all the other words into them. I took the quiz and missed every question.</div>

<div class="line_en">That failure sat uneasily in my mind. It was the first indication of whether I would be okay, whether whatever I had in my head by way of education was enough. After the quiz, the answer seemed clear: it was not enough. On realizing this, I might have resented my upbringing but I didn't. My loyalty to my father had increased in proportion to the miles between us. On the mountain, I could rebel. But here, in this loud, bright place, surrounded by gentiles disguised as saints, I clung to every truth, every doctrine he had given me. Doctors were Sons of Perdition. Homeschooling was a commandment from the Lord.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那次失败让我忐忑不安。这是第一个可以衡量我是否够格、我大脑中经由教育得到的知识储备是否足够的指标。这次测验之后，答案似乎很明确：还不够。意识到这一点，我本该憎恨我的成长环境，但我没有。我对父亲的忠诚与我们之间的距离成正比。在山上，我可以反抗。但在这里，在这个明亮喧嚣的地方，被伪装成圣人的异教徒包围着，我坚守着他教导我的每一条真理、每一条教义。医生是堕落之子。家庭教育是上帝的旨意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我在记忆中搜索。从某种程度上来说，“大屠杀”这个词并不完全陌生。也许在我们采摘蔷薇果或者制作山楂酊剂时，母亲曾教过我。我的确有种模糊的概念，知道犹太人很久以前在什么地方被杀害。但我以为那只是一场小规模的冲突，就像父亲经常提到的波士顿惨案。在那次事件中，有六人被残暴的政府杀害。六百万犹太人惨遭屠杀，我却误以为只有五六个人的规模，这让人无法接受。">查看中文翻译</div>

I do remember imagining for a moment, not the camps, not the pits or chambers of gas, but my mother's face. A wave of emotion took me, a feeling so intense, so unfamiliar, I wasn't sure what it was. It made me want to shout at her, at my own mother, and that frightened me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew I should stop -- this was the Lord's time -- but I hadn't even started the assignment for music theory, which was due at seven A. M. on Monday. The Sabbath begins when I wake up, I reasoned, and kept working.</div>

<div class="line_en">I spent the morning and afternoon trying to decipher the history textbook, without much success. In the evening, I tried to write a personal essay for English, but I'd never written an essay before -- except for the ones on sin and repentance, which no one had ever read -- and I didn't know how. I had no idea what the teacher meant by the "essay form." I scribbled a few sentences, crossed them out, then began again. I repeated this until it was past midnight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上午和下午我都在试图限免历史课本，但收效甚微。晚上我试着写一篇英语课的论文，但我从未写过论文——除了关于罪恶和忏悔的文章，那些从来没有人读过——我不知道怎么写。我不知道老师说的“论文形式”是什么意思。我草草写了几个句子，划掉，又重写。就这样反反复复，直到过了午夜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd always known that my father believed in a different God. As a child, I'd been aware that although my family attended the same church as everyone in our town, our religion was not the same. They believed in modesty; we practiced it. They believed in God's power to heal; we left our injuries in God's hands. They believed in preparing for the Second Coming; we were actually prepared. For as long as I could remember, I'd known that the members of my own family were the only true Mormons I had ever known, and yet for some reason, here at this university, in this chapel, for the first time I felt the immensity of the gap. I understood now: I could stand with my family, or with the gentiles, on the one side or the other, but there was no foothold in between.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直知道父亲信仰的是另一个神。孩提时我就意识到，虽然我的家人和我们镇上的每个人都去同一座教堂，但我们的宗教信仰不一样。他们信仰谦逊；我们身体力行。他们信仰上帝有治愈之力；我们将伤病交由上帝处理。他们信仰要为基督复临做准备；我们采取实际行动。从我记事起，我就知道我的家人是我认识的人里仅有的真正的摩门教徒，然而出于某种原因，在这所大学，在这座礼拜堂里，我第一次感受到巨大的鸿沟。现在我明白了：我可以选择站在我家人的一边，或者站在异教徒的一边，非此即彼，此外别无选择。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I awoke with my face pressed to the desk. The room was bright. I could hear Shannon and Mary in the kitchen. I put on my Sunday dress and the three of us walked to church. Because it was a congregation of students, everyone was sitting with their roommates, so I settled into a pew with mine. Shannon immediately began chatting with the girl behind us. I looked around the chapel and was again struck by how many women were wearing skirts cut above the knee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="醒来时我发现自己的脸贴在桌子上。房间明亮。我能听见香农和玛丽在厨房里说话。我穿上礼拜日的衣服，我们三人步行去教堂。教堂会众都是学生，大家都与室友坐在一起，于是我也和室友们坐在同一张长凳上。香农立刻与后面的一个女生聊了起来。我环顾教堂，又一次被那么多女孩穿着露膝短裙而震惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The service ended and we filed into Sunday school. Shannon and Mary chose seats near the front. They saved me one but I hesitated, thinking of how I'd broken the Sabbath. I'd been here less than a week, and already I had robbed the Lord of an hour. Perhaps that was why Dad hadn't wanted me to come: because he knew that by living with them, with people whose faith was less, I risked becoming like them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礼拜结束了，我们列队走进主日学校。香农和玛丽选了前排的座位。她们给我留了一个，但我犹豫了，想到我已破了安息日的规矩。我来这里还不到一星期，就已经剥夺了上帝的一小时。也许那就是爸爸不让我来的原因：因为他知道，和他们一起生活，和信仰不那么坚定的人一起生活，我极有可能会变得和他们一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shannon waved to me and her V-neck plunged. I walked past her and folded myself into a corner, as far from Shannon and Mary as I could get. I was pleased by the familiarity of the arrangement: me, pressed into the corner, away from the other children, a precise reproduction of every Sunday school lesson from my childhood. It was the only sensation of familiarity I'd felt since coming to this place, and I relished it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="香农向我招手，她的V领开得很低。我从她身边走过，把自己缩到一个角落里，尽可能远离香农和玛丽。我对这种熟悉的安排感到高兴：我，缩进角落，远离其他孩子，准确地再现了童年时期我每次在主日学校上课时的情景。这是我来到这个地方以后唯一熟悉的感觉，我喜欢这种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
