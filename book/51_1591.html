<div class="line_en">It takes a while to explain the situation to Peeta. How Foxface stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it, how she wouldn't question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not on purpose. Doesn't seem fair somehow. I mean, we would have both been dead, too, if she hadn't eaten the berries first." He checks himself. "No, of course, we wouldn't. You recognized them, didn't you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree, and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. "I can't climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and I don't think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打算往森林深处走，找一棵大树隐藏起来，准备在那里过夜。可皮塔坚决反对。“我不像你那么会爬树，再说我的腿也不行，我可不想睡着觉从五十英尺高的地方掉到地上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sigh. Several more hours of walking -- or should I say crashing -- through the woods to reach an area we'll just have to leave in the morning to hunt. But Peeta doesn't ask for much. He's followed my instructions all day and I'm sure if things were reversed, he wouldn't make me spend the night in a tree. It dawns on me that I haven't been very nice to Peeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him over disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has probably just about had it with me. And as for the audience…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我叹了口气。我们要在树林里走几小时路程，或者说，要一路噼里啪啦踩着树枝残叶回去，待一晚第二天再出来打猎。可皮塔的要求也不过分，他一整天都听从我的指挥，反过来换了他，也不会要求我在树上过夜。反思我自己今天对皮塔也不怎么好。唠叨他出的声音太大，因为找不到他又大吵大嚷。我们在石洞里的那份浪漫情怀在野外、在炎炎烈日下、在加图的威胁中，都消失了。黑密斯肯定又要怨我了，而且观众也…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be sending off smoke for a few more hours, although I doubt Cato assumes anything at this point. When we reach the stream, I see the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace, so I suggest we walk back in it. Peeta's happy to oblige and since he's a lot quieter in water than on land, it's a doubly good idea. It's a long walk back to the cave though, even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost. We're both exhausted by our hike today and still way too underfed. I keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish I might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们又在火堆里扔进一捆木柴，这样浓烟还能再持续几个小时，尽管如此，我怀疑加图看到后是否会采取行动。我们回到溪边时，水位下降了很多，溪流仍像以往一样缓缓地流淌着。我建议两人还在溪水里走。皮塔很乐意听从我的建议，这样他的声音比在陆地小得多。但这也许并不是太好的主意，就算我们顺溪流而下，也有兔肉给我们补充能量，但回石洞所用的时间要长得多。我们两个人都很疲乏，吃得也不够饱。我的弓上时刻搭着箭，防备加图袭击，也未能捕到鱼。但很奇怪，小溪里似乎没什么生物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looks pleased and relieved. "Well, that was easy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很高兴，悬着的心也放下来，“好的，这样就太好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den. It's not much, but out here in the wilderness, it's the closest thing we have to a home. It will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through Peeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the hunt has taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes. He drops off immediately. I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead, not for the audience, but for me. Because I'm so grateful that he's still here, not dead by the stream as I'd thought. So glad that I don't have to face Cato alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们到达目的地时，腿已经酸乏无力，太阳也快要落山了。我们在瓶里装上水，越过一个小山坡，来到石洞。这石洞虽然不起眼，但在茫茫荒野中，这是最像“家”的地方，另外，这里也比树上暖和，总算给我们一点遮挡，这时寒风已从西边徐徐地吹起。我把美味的晚餐摆好，皮塔吃了一半就开始打盹了。好多天不活动了，今天出去打猎也够他累的。我命令他钻进睡袋睡觉，把他剩下的食物留着睡醒了吃。他很快就沉沉睡去，我把睡袋拉到他下巴底下，吻了一下他的额头。这不是为了观众，而是为我，因为我很感激他还好好地活着，没有如我想的倒在溪边，我真高兴不必一个人去面对加图。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Brutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, who has had it out for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special hatred for me ever since I outscored him in training. A boy like Peeta would simply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it drove Cato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I think of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. The others were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. I wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加图，一个残忍、血腥的家伙，他胳膊一使劲就能拧断人的脖子，他能打过萨里什，从一开始就对我死盯不放，也许在训练中我成绩超过他时，就已经恨上了我。换了皮塔这样的男孩，会一笑了之。我有种感觉，我的好成绩也让他心烦意乱。还记得我炸掉他们的补给品时，其他人只是感到不安，而他却像是发了神经，我甚至怀疑现在加图的神志是否完全正常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface shine in the sky and then disappear from the world forever. He hasn't said it, but I don't think Peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential. I can't pretend I'll miss her, but I have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she'd have sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peeta's own ignorance that brought her down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空中出现国徽，狐狸脸的影像在空中闪动，之后就从这世上完全消失了。虽然皮塔没说，但我觉得他对她的死一定感觉不好，即使这是不得已的。我不能假装自己会想念她，但我也很佩服她。我觉得如果对大家都进行测试，她肯定是最聪明的一个。如果，毒浆果是我们故意设的圈套，她一定会感觉到，也不会吃。正因为皮塔本人也不知道，才导致她的死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had a sense of Foxface, who she was and how she operated, he's a little more slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? I don't know. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Foxface demonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that point. I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pig's mouth when I was so enraged. Maybe I do understand Cato better than I think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的思绪又回到加图那里。我对狐狸脸有一定的判断力，她是谁，她会怎么行动，而对于加图却没有这种判断力。他很有力气、受过训练，可他聪明吗？我不知道。看上去不像狐狸脸那么聪明，也完全没有她的控制力。我认为加图在大发脾气后，会完全失去判断力，至少我感觉他在这方面没有超常的能力。我想起自己生气时朝猪嘴里的苹果射的那一箭，也许我对加图的了解比我想象的要多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I don't think there will be another night in the arena somehow. One way or the other, dead or alive, I have the feeling I'll escape it today. I give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to the stream to wash up. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I may do my hair and braid it back wet. I'm wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream.

<div class="line_en">We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where the Careers trapped me. The husk of the tracker jacker nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun, confirms the location. I touch it with the tip of my boot, and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze. I can't help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker jackers. Glimmer's bloated body. The terrifying hallucinations…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们走到被职业选手困住的那棵树时，停下了脚步。蜂巢经风吹日晒，已成了空壳，就是这里，没错。我用鞋尖踢了一下蜂巢，它立刻化为灰烬，随风而去。我忍不住看了看露露爬过的那棵树，当时，就是在这棵树上，她想出这个办法救了我一命。追踪蜂，格丽默的尸体，可怕的幻觉…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't care now that Peeta's footfalls send rodents scurrying, make birds take wing. We have to fight Cato and I'd just as soon do it here as on the plain. But I doubt I'll have that choice. If the Gamemakers want us in the open, then in the open we will be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已不在乎皮塔沉重的脚步声惊走了飞鸟，我们要去与加图进行一场厮杀，无论在这里还是在荒原，我都会毫不犹豫地冲上去，如果大赛组织者要我们在空地，那好吧，厮杀就在空地展开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Given our late start to the day, when we reach the plain it's already early evening. There's no sign of Cato. No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays. Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface on us, we circle the Cornucopia to make sure it's empty. Then obediently, as if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our water containers.</div>

<div class="line_en">The music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. As the notes overlap, they complement one another, forming a lovely, unearthly harmony. It was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night. Does someone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that she is dead?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟鸣奏出的美丽音调传得越来越远，我觉得这小调很好听。当鸟鸣声交叠时，形成美妙的和声，是那么的和谐动听。感谢露露，是她用这美妙的声音把十一区辛勤的果园工人送入够乡。现在她已不在了，我在想，会有人把它当成收工曲吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We sit by the lake, in full sight. There's no point in hiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can see the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and sing out Rue's four-note run. I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in the silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then another. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a while, I just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by the beauty of the song. Then something begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines.
