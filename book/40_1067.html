<div class="line_en">Mariam watched his face relax, loosen. She watched the folds clear from his brow. Suspicion and misgiving winked out of his eyes. He sat up straight, and, for a few brief moments, he appeared merely thoughtful, like a ship captain informed of imminent mutiny taking his time to ponder his next move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆发现他绷紧的脸松开了，他额头的皱纹变平了。他的眼神不再带着怀疑和忧虑。他直挺挺地坐着，坐了好一会，他只是显得一副心事重重的样子，就像一个获知手下即将叛变的船长在仔细考虑如何采取下一步的行动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Zalmai's face, Mariam saw alarm. Nervously, he looked around at the three of them. He sensed now that his tattletale game had let something serious -- adult serious -- into the room. He cast a despondent, contrite glance toward Mariam, then his mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam saw his feet pounding the steps as he came down. She saw him pocketing the key, saw his belt, the perforated end wrapped tightly around his knuckles. The fake brass buckle dragged behind him, bouncing on the steps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德走下来，玛丽雅姆看见他的脚沉重地踩在楼梯上。他看见他把钥匙放进口袋，看见他的皮带，打孔的一端紧紧地系在他的拳头上。那个仿黄铜的皮带头拖在他身后，随着他的脚步一蹦一跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stood frozen, Mariam and Laila, eyes to the ground, as though looking at each other would give credence to the way Rasheed saw things, that while he was opening doors and lugging baggage for people who wouldn't spare him a glance a lewd conspiracy was shaping behind his back, in his home, in his beloved son's presence. Neither one of them said a word. They listened to the footsteps in the hallway above, one heavy and foreboding, the other the pattering of a skittish little animal. They listened to muted words passed, a squeaky plea, a curt retort, a door shut, the rattle of a key as it turned. Then one set of footsteps returning, more impatiently now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们——玛丽雅姆和莱拉——浑身僵硬地坐着，眼睛望着地面，仿佛彼此对望将会证实拉希德心中的猜测：当他为一些对他不屑一顾的人开门和提行李时，在他的家里，当着他心爱的儿子的面，一个猥亵的阴谋正在形成。她们两人也都没有说话。她们听着楼上走廊两种脚步声，其中一种沉重而隐含着不祥之兆，另外一种则像是小动物蹦蹦跳跳的走路声。她们听到几句低声的交谈，颤抖的哀求，严厉的斥责，门关上的响声，钥匙转动的咔嗒声。然后脚步声又响起了，这次显得更加焦躁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went to stop him, but he shoved her back and blew by her. Without saying a word, he swung the belt at Laila. He did it with such speed that she had no time to retreat or duck, or even raise a protective arm. Laila touched her fingers to her temple, looked at the blood, looked at Rasheed, with astonishment. It lasted only a moment or two, this look of disbelief, before it was replaced by something hateful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走过去拦住他，但他把她推开，从她身边走了过去。他一言不发，挥起皮带对着莱拉抽过去。皮带甩过去的速度很快，她来不及后退或者蹲下，甚至来不及抬手挡住。莱拉伸出手去摸自己的太阳穴，看到了血迹，看到了拉希德，吓得呆住了。但她脸上这种难以置信的表情只延续了一两秒钟，紧接着就被一种憎恨的神色取代了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam lost count of how many times the belt cracked, how many pleading words she cried out to Rasheed, how many times she circled around the incoherent tangle of teeth and fists and belt, before she saw fingers clawing at Rasheed's face, chipped nails digging into his jowls and pulling at his hair and scratching his forehead. How long before she realized, with both shock and relish, that the fingers were hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆已经数不清莱拉被皮带打中多少次了，也数不清她已经哀求拉希德多少次，更数不清她有多少次扑到咬牙切齿、挥舞着拳头和皮带的拉希德身边，然后看见十根手指抓着拉希德的脸，断裂的指甲挖着他的下颚、拖着他的头发和抓着他的额头。过了很久她才又惊又喜地发现，那些手指竟然是她自己的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rasheed swung the belt again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德又挥起了皮带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time, Laila shielded herself with a forearm and made a grab at the belt. She missed, and Rasheed brought the belt down again. Laila caught it briefly before Rasheed yanked it free and lashed at her again. Then Laila was dashing around the room, and Mariam was screaming words that ran together and imploring Rasheed, as he chased Laila, as he blocked her way and cracked his belt at her. At one point, Laila ducked and managed to land a punch across his ear, which made him spit a curse and pursue her even more relentlessly. He caught her, threw her up against the wall, and struck her with the belt again and again, the buckle slamming against her chest, her shoulder, her raised arms, her fingers, drawing blood wherever it struck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次莱拉用小臂挡在身前，伸手去抓皮带。她没抓到，拉希德再次抽了过来。莱拉抓到了，但拉希德随即大喊一声，把它抽回去，又甩了她一下。然后莱拉在房间里跑了起来，玛丽雅姆边跑边哭喊着说话，苦苦哀求拉希德，拉希德则追逐着莱拉、挡住她的去路，不停地用皮带抽她。莱拉有一次蹲身躲开，挥起拳头打在他的耳朵上；这让拉希德破口大骂，更加锲而不舍地追打她。他抓住她，把她举起来，向墙壁撞去，用皮带一次又一次地抽她，皮带头打中她的胸膛、她的肩膀、她抬起的手臂和她的手指，无论打中哪里，总是打得莱拉鲜血直流。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam remembered the first time she had seen his eyes, under the wedding veil, in the mirror, with Jalil looking on, how their gazes had slid across the glass and met, his indifferent, hers docile, conceding, almost apologetic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆想起她第一次看到这双眼睛，在婚纱之下，在镜子之中，伴随着扎里勒的注视，他们的目光在玻璃镜中相遇，他的很冷漠，她的则温顺而服从，甚至还带着歉意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He let go of Laila and turned on her. At first, he looked at her without seeing her, then his eyes narrowed, appraised Mariam with interest. The look in them shifted from puzzlement to shock, then disapproval, disappointment even, lingering there a moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他放过了莱拉，转而对付她。开始，他迷茫地看着她，然后他眼睛眯了起来，专注地打量着玛丽雅姆。他的双眼先是露出迷惑的神色，接着是震惊、愤怒，甚至还有一闪而过的失望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The belt made a thump when Rasheed dropped it to the ground and came for her. Some jobs, that thump said, were meant to be done with bare hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德把皮带扔到地上，发出砰的一声巨响，然后朝她走过来。那声巨响说，他将要空手来对付她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他打算扼死她，她们两人对此无计可施。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam clawed at him. She beat at his chest. She hurled herself against him. She struggled to uncurl his fingers from Laila's neck. She bit them. But they remained tightly clamped around Laila's windpipe, and Mariam saw that he meant to carry this through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆抓他。她捶打他的胸膛。她用自己的身体去撞他。她使劲想掰开他扼住莱拉脖子的手指。她咬它们。但它们依然紧紧地掐着莱拉的气管，玛丽雅姆看出他并不打算松手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam backed away and left the room. She was aware of a thumping sound from upstairs, aware that tiny palms were slapping against a locked door. She ran down the hallway. She burst through the front door. Crossed the yard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆后退几步，离开了客厅。她听见楼上传来一阵啪啪声，她知道那是一双小手在拍打着锁上的房门。她奔过走廊。她从前门冲出去。穿过院子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But just as he was bearing down on her, Mariam saw Laila behind him pick something up from the ground. She watched Laila's hand rise overhead, hold, then come swooping down against the side of his face. Glass shattered. The jagged remains of the drinking glass rained down to the ground. There was blood on Laila's hands, blood flowing from the open gash on Rasheed's cheek, blood down his neck, on his shirt. He turned around, all snarling teeth and blazing eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，正当他试图把她压倒，玛丽雅姆看见莱拉在他身后，从地面上捡起了一件东西。她看见莱拉的手高高举起，停在头顶，然后猛然朝他的脑袋砸下去。玻璃碎裂，玻璃水罐参差不齐的碎片纷纷撒落在地面。莱拉手上有血，鲜血从拉希德脸颊上的伤口流出来，流到他的脖子上，流到他的衬衣上。他转过身，咬紧牙齿，双眼放出凶光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rasheed didn't notice her coming back into the room. He was still on top of Laila, his eyes wide and crazy, his hands wrapped around her neck. Laila's face was turning blue now, and her eyes had rolled back. Mariam saw that she was no longer struggling. He's going to kill her, she thought. He really means to. And Mariam could not, would not, allow that to happen. He'd taken so much from her in twenty-seven years of marriage. She would not watch him take Laila too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德并没有发现她已经回到客厅。他仍压在莱拉身上，疯狂的双眼睁得大大的，他的双手卡住她的喉咙。这时莱拉的脸色已经变紫，翻着白眼。玛丽雅姆看到她已经不再挣扎了。他就要杀死她了，她想，他真的要杀死她。玛丽雅姆不能也不会容许这件事发生。结婚二十七年来，他已经从她这儿夺走太多。她不会看着他把莱拉也抢走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他抬起头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rasheed touched his head with the palm of his hand. He looked at the blood on his fingertips, then at Mariam. She thought she saw his face soften. She imagined that something had passed between them, that maybe she had quite literally knocked some understanding into his head. Maybe he saw something in her face too, Mariam thought, something that made him hedge. Maybe he saw some trace of all the self-denial, all the sacrifice, all the sheer exertion it had taken her to live with him for all these years, live with his continual condescension and violence, his faultfinding and meanness. Was that respect she saw in his eyes? Regret?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德用他的手掌去摸自己的脑袋。他看着指尖上的血滴，然后看着玛丽雅姆。她觉得她看到他的脸色变得柔和了。她幻想他们之间有了某种交流，幻想这一下也许真的把他的脑袋给打醒了。也许他也从她脸上看到某些神情，玛丽雅姆想，某些让他望而却步的神情。也许他终于有点明白，玛丽雅姆要付出多少自我否定、牺牲和心血，才能够默默地忍受他的呵责和暴力、他的鸡蛋里挑骨头和他的卑劣，和他生活在一起的这么多年。她在他眼中看到的是尊敬吗？是后悔吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But then his upper lip curled back into a spiteful sneer, and Mariam knew then the futility, maybe even the irresponsibility, of not finishing this. If she let him walk now, how long before he fetched the key from his pocket and went for that gun of his upstairs in the room where he'd locked Zalmai? Had Mariam been certain that he would be satisfied with shooting only her, that there was a chance he would spare Laila, she might have dropped the shovel. But in Rasheed's eyes she saw murder for them both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他的上唇向上翘，露出恶毒的狞笑；玛丽雅姆立即明白，如果她不完成这件事，那么将会前功尽弃，甚至将会对不起莱拉。如果她容许他现在走开，他需要多久来把口袋里的钥匙掏出来，走到楼上，打开他关住察尔迈伊的房间，拿出那把手枪呢？要是确定他一枪把她自己打死就会心满意足，确定他有可能会放过莱拉，那么玛丽雅姆说不定会放下铁锹。但从拉希德的眼神，她看得出来他想杀了她们两个。">查看中文翻译</div>
