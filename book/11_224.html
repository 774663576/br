<div class="line_en">The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and three black figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river-bank. The house at Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air. As he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall. Then he shut and locked the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们在布理的旅店准备就寝时，雄鹿地正笼罩在一片黑暗当中，一阵迷雾在山谷和河岸间徘徊不去。溪谷地的屋子毫无声响。小胖博格小心翼翼的打开门，往外窥探。他一整天都觉得忐忑不安，睡也睡不着，彷佛凝滞的夜空中有某种威胁正蓄势待发。就在他往外窥探的同时，树下有道黑影无声的移动，大门似乎凭藉着自己的意志无声无息的打开又关上。他感到无比的恐惧。他缩了回去，在客厅内浑身发抖。最后，他好不容易才锁上了大门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did, out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the doorstep. "No, no, no!" he was crying. "No, not me! I haven't got it!" It was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about. At last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time.</div>

Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.</div>

The wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard. Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. The first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming through the open window.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and to fetch them a "bite". But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were gone: not only Merry's ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶油伯急忙出去看看马匹是否都已备妥，顺便替他们拿些食物。不过，他很快就气急败坏的回来。小马全不见了。马房的门都在半夜被打开，所有的马儿都不见了。不只是梅里的小马，而是关在那边的所有牲畜都消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dark times," said Strider. "But for the present you may be left in peace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Never mind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be packed in a few minutes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是黑暗的预兆，”神行客说。“不过，至少在我们走了之后，你可以获得片刻的安宁。我们会马上离开。别管什么早餐的了，我们站着随便吃喝一点东西就可以了。我们几分钟之内就走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach Rivendell on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They might as well set out for the Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength and courage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这坏消息几乎让佛罗多走不动路。他们怎么可能在骑马的追兵跟踪下徒步到达瑞文戴尔？不如直接去月亮还比较快。神行客沉默的看着四名哈比人，彷佛在评估着他们的力量和勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen," he said at last, thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. "We should not go much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. I was going to walk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. How much are you prepared to carry on your backs?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“奶油伯先生，难道没有别的办法吗？”佛罗多问。“我们能不能从村里弄几匹小马？甚至只要一匹扛行李就好？我想应该没办法用雇的，但我们或许可以买下它们，”他有些迟疑的补上一句，心中其实不太确定自己是否买的起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Strider reluctantly, "you had better do that. I am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so ends all hope of starting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”神行客不情愿的说。“你最好赶快想办法。我担心这次至少会需要一匹小马来驼行李。我们趁着天色昏暗，悄悄离开的计划就这样报销了！这跟敲锣打鼓通知大家没什么两样嘛！我想这一定是他们计划好的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I doubt it," said the landlord unhappily. "The two or three riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they're gone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there are very few of them in Bree, and they won't be for sale. But I'll do what I can. I'll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end there was more than three hours' delay. Bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood -- except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell. "A poor old half-starved creature it is," said Bob; "but he won't part with it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you're placed, not if I knows Bill Ferny."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们的行程被延后了不只三个小时。包伯回报附近没有任何愿意出借或贩售的马匹。只有一个例外：比尔—羊齿蕨有一匹待价而沽的座骑。“那只可怜的瘦马饿的半死，”包伯说，“如果我猜的没错，老比尔看到你们的惨况，绝对会趁机把价格哄抬到三倍以上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen. The others had been driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different corners of the Bree-land. Merry's ponies had escaped altogether, and eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in search of Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while, and were well-off. But when news of the events at Bree came to Tom's ears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price. They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. But they never came to Rivendell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，最后还是好人有好报。不久以后，他们才发现其实只有一匹马被偷。其它的都是被赶开，或是惊慌中四散奔逃。它们随即就在布理附近不同的地方被发现了。梅里的小马一起行动，最后跑回丘陵地去找胖乡巴佬。所以，它们在汤姆的照顾下过了一段不错的日子。但是当汤姆听说了布理的状况之后，他就把这些小马送到奶油伯身边去。因此，奶油伯等于用相当不错的价格买到了五匹好马。当然，它们在布理得要工作的比较辛苦，但包伯对它们很不错。因此，总的来看，它们运气还算好，躲开了一段黑暗危险的旅程，唯一可惜的是没有机会去瑞文戴尔看看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bill Ferny's price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at least three times the pony's value in those pans. It proved to be a bony, underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔的价格是十二枚银币；这的确是三倍以上的价钱。那匹小马果然是个骨瘦如柴，营养不良，无精打采的动物，但它至少看起来还不会太快死掉。奶油伯先生自掏腰包出了这笔钱，还给了梅里另外十八枚银币以补偿其它走失的小马。他是个诚实做生意的商人，在布理的名声也不坏；但三十银币对他依旧是个沉重的打击，这笔钱是被黑心比尔给骗走的事实更是雪上加霜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting. It was close on ten o'clock before they at last got off. By that time the whole of Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo's vanishing trick; the appearance of the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years. Most of the inhabitants of Bree and Staddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the road to see the travellers start. The other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house," said Butterbur angrily, "you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me.

<div class="line_en">However, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone for good, or for bad. And he had other troubles. For there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny's squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell on him at once.</div>

But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of them: a parting present from Nob and Bob. "Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting," he said. "But I reckon I'll miss them both before long."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills," answered Strider. "The Men of the West did not live here; though in their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of Angmar. This path was made to serve the forts along the walls. But long before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great watch-tower on Weathertop, Amon Sul they called it. It was burned and broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown on the old hill's head. Yet once it was tall and fair. It is told that Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in the days of the Last Alliance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。风云顶和这些山丘上都没有古墓，”神行客回答。“西方皇族并不居住在这里；不过，晚期他们曾经利用这些丘陵当做抵抗安格马邪恶势力的防线。这条小径是山间碉堡的运补线。不过，在那之前，北方王国刚创建的时候；他们在风云顶上盖了一座高大的了望塔。他们称该塔为阿蒙苏尔。不过后来它被烧毁了，只剩下一圈围墙，彷佛是座简陋的皇冠套在这山丘上。但，它曾经一度是个高大雄伟的建筑。据说人皇伊兰迪尔曾经在此守候精灵领袖吉尔加拉德，等待他加入人类与精灵的最后联盟。”">查看中文翻译</div>

All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is here.

For the black horses can see, and the Riders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast shadows in their minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then they are most to be feared. And at all times they smell the blood of living things, desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other than sight or smell. We can feel their presence -- it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also," he added, and his voice sank to a whisper, "the Ring draws them."</div>

<div class="line_en">Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of evening began to fall, and it grew cold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not eaten anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper. The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world. Rangers passed at times beyond the hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road would travellers be found, most often dwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and few words to spare for strangers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again. "That is a song," he said, "in the mode that is called ann-thennath among the Elves, but is hard to render in our Common Speech, and this is but a rough echo of it. It tells of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and Luthien Tinuviel. Beren was a mortal man, but Luthien was the daughter of Thingol, a King of Elves upon Middle-earth when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the children of this world. As the stars above the mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in her face was a shining light. In those days the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a servant, dwelt in Angband in the North, and the Elves of the West coming back to Middle-earth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which he had stolen; and the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the Enemy was victorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping through great peril came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the forest of Neldoreth. There he beheld Luthien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river Esgalduin; and he named her Tinuviel, that is Nightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and they were parted long. Tinuviel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron, and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great Enemy from his throne, and took from his iron crown one of the three Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of Luthien to Thingol her father. Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tinuviel. But she chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow him; and it is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering Seas, and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, long ago, beyond the confines of this world. So it is that Luthien Tinuviel alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of old descended among Men. There live still those of whom Luthien was the foremother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin. For of Beren and Luthien was born Dior Thingol's heir; and of him Elwing the White whom Earendil wedded, he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril upon his brow. And of Earendil came the Kings of Numenor, that is Westernesse."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="山姆和梅里站了起来，走到火光外。佛罗多和皮聘依旧在营火前沉思。神行客专注的看着山坡上的月光。一切似乎都十分平静。但佛罗多觉得神行客一说完故事，就有股冰冷的恐惧爬上心头。他又往营火靠近了些。就在那时，山姆从坑洞的边缘跑了回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice was rich and deep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the hill-top faded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当神行客在述说着这一切时，他们看着他被火光照红的脸颊，注意到他脸上激动的表情。他的双眼发亮，声音充满了感情。他的头上是一片黑暗的天空。突然间，一道苍白的光芒从风云顶之上照下。新月已爬上了山丘，遮掩了原先隐约的星光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise. It was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their backs turned to the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or movement in the night. Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out aloud.</div>

<div class="line_en">three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个还是四个的高大身影就站在斜坡上，低头看着他们。他们黑暗的身体彷佛想要将一切吸入一般。佛罗多可以听见恶毒的嘶嘶声和感到刺骨的寒意。接着，那黑影开始缓缓的前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the ground. Sam shrank to Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. The desire to do this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt that he must take the Ring and put it on his finger. He could not speak. He felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble, but he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里和皮聘害怕的不能动弹，只能趴在地上动也不动。山姆紧靠着佛罗多。佛罗多并没有好到哪里去：他全身剧烈的颤抖，但那恐惧却突然间被戴上魔戒的欲望所掩盖了。他满脑子都是魔戒的影像，根本无法多做思考。他没有忘记古墓的经历，更没有忘记甘道夫的忠告；但似乎有种力量引诱他忽视一切的警告，而他已经快要屈服了。这并不是因为他想要逃跑，或是做任何的好事、坏事，他只是单纯的想要戴上魔戒。他说不出话来。他可以感觉到山姆正担心的看着他，彷佛感应到自己的主人有了麻烦；但他却无法转过头去看着山姆。他闭上眼，挣扎了片刻，但很快的就再也无法抵抗这诱惑。佛罗多缓缓的掏出练子，将魔戒套上左手的食指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see beneath their black wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel. Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. Two of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others: his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然一切都和之前一样，但敌人的身影立刻变得清晰许多。他能够看见那黑衣底下的身躯。一共有五名高大的骑士，两名站在山坡上，三名正步步进逼。他们苍白的脸孔上是无情的双眼，披风底下则是灰色的长袍。他们灰色的头发上带着银制的头盔，枯瘦的手中则握着钢铁的长剑。他们锐利的眼光彷佛穿透了他，立刻快步向他走来。他绝望中掏出剑，在他眼中看来，这剑染着火红的色彩，彷佛是根炙热的火把。两个身影停了下来。第三个比其它骑士都要高，它的头盔上套着皇冠。他一只手拿着长剑，一只手则拿着小刀。拿着小刀的手和刀柄都同样透出苍白的幽光。他一跃向前，扑向佛罗多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard himself crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the Ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在同时，佛罗多也跟着扑向地面；他听见自己叫喊着＊伊尔碧绿丝！姬尔松耐尔！＊同时他也砍中了敌人的小腿。一声凄厉的叫喊划破夜空，他觉得彷佛有根淬毒的冰块刺进他左边的肩膀。即使在那天旋地转中，他还是看见神行客双手各拿着火把，从黑暗中跳了出来。佛罗多使尽最后的力气丢下剑，将戒指褪下，牢牢的用手抓住。">查看中文翻译</div>
