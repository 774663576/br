<div class="line_en">If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for the next few years would not have been at all good for her. She was treated more as if she were a distinguished guest at the establishment than as if she were a mere little girl. If she had been a self-opinionated, domineering child, she might have become disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much indulged and flattered. If she had been an indolent child, she would have learned nothing. Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she was far too worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a desirable pupil wish to leave her school. She knew quite well that if Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy, Captain Crewe would remove her at once. Miss Minchin's opinion was that if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was so treated. Accordingly, Sara was praised for her quickness at her lessons, for her good manners, for her amiability to her fellow pupils, for her generosity if she gave sixpence to a beggar out of her full little purse; the simplest thing she did was treated as if it were a virtue, and if she had not had a disposition and a clever little brain, she might have been a very self-satisfied young person. But the clever little brain told her a great many sensible and true things about herself and her circumstances, and now and then she talked these things over to Ermengarde as time went on.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Things happen to people by accident," she used to say. "A lot of nice accidents have happened to me. It just HAPPENED that I always liked lessons and books, and could remember things when I learned them. It just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever, and could give me everything I liked. Perhaps I have not really a good temper at all, but if you have everything you want and everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be good-tempered? I don't know" -- looking quite serious -- "how I shall ever find out whether I am really a nice child or a horrid one.

<div class="line_en">Lavinia, in fact, was spiteful. She was inordinately jealous of Sara. Until the new pupil's arrival, she had felt herself the leader in the school. She had led because she was capable of making herself extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her. She domineered over the little children, and assumed grand airs with those big enough to be her companions. She was rather pretty, and had been the best-dressed pupil in the procession when the Select Seminary walked out two by two, until Sara's velvet coats and sable muffs appeared, combined with drooping ostrich feathers, and were led by Miss Minchin at the head of the line. This, at the beginning, had been bitter enough; but as time went on it became apparent that Sara was a leader, too, and not because she could make herself disagreeable, but because she never did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上拉维尼娅很恶毒。她毫无节制地忌妒萨拉。在萨拉这个新生到校以前，她一直自以为是学校里的头儿。她所以能当头儿是因为她能使那些不听她的同学感到她极难对付。她欺侮年纪小的儿童，对能当她伙伴的较大的那些孩子则装腔作势。她相当漂亮，当这高级女童培育院的学生两人一排列队外出时，她曾是穿戴得最好的一个。可是后来出现了萨拉，穿着天鹅绒上衣，带着黑貂皮暖手筒，还配着耷拉着的鸵鸟羽毛，由铭钦女士领着走在行列的最前头。这起初使拉维尼娅觉得够难受的；后来随着时间的推移，情况变得很明显，萨拉也成了学生中的头儿，不是由于她能闹别扭，而是因为她从不那样做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's one thing about Sara Crewe," Jessie had enraged her "best friend" by saying honestly, "she's never `grand' about herself the least bit, and you know she might be, Lavvie. I believe I couldn't help being -- just a little -- if I had so many fine things and was made such a fuss over. It's disgusting, the way Miss Minchin shows her off when parents come."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是”杰西慢吞吞地说“他打死过老虎。萨拉屋里的那张虎皮就是她爸爸打死的那只老虎的皮。难怪她那样喜爱它。她躺在上面，抚弄着它的头，对它讲话，拿它当一只猫”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quite true that Sara was never "grand." She was a friendly little soul, and shared her privileges and belongings with a free hand. The little ones, who were accustomed to being disdained and ordered out of the way by mature ladies aged ten and twelve, were never made to cry by this most envied of them all. She was a motherly young person, and when people fell down and scraped their knees, she ran and helped them up and patted them, or found in her pocket a bonbon or some other article of a soothing nature. She never pushed them out of her way or alluded to their years as a humiliation and a blot upon their small characters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="千真万确，萨拉从“炫”。她是个友善的小精灵，信手将自己的特殊待遇和所有之物与人分享。那些年龄小的孩子已习惯于被那些十至十二岁较成熟的小姐鄙视，喝斥滚开，但是她们从未被这位最堪羡慕的同学惹哭过。她是个慈母般的小人儿，当别人跌倒擦伤膝盖时，她跑过去扶她们起来，拍抚她们，或者从衣袋里摸出一块夹心糖或什么能安抚她们的小玩意儿。她从来不把她们推开给自己让路，也从不含沙射影地羞辱她们年幼无知，性格上有瑕点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"`Dear Sara must come into the drawing room and talk to Mrs. Musgrave about India,'" mimicked Lavinia, in her most highly flavored imitation of Miss Minchin. "`Dear Sara must speak French to Lady Pitkin. Her accent is so perfect.' She didn't learn her French at the Seminary, at any rate. And there's nothing so clever in her knowing it. She says herself she didn't learn it at all. She just picked it up, because she always heard her papa speak it. And, as to her papa, there is nothing so grand in being an Indian officer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的萨拉一定得去客厅和马斯格雷夫太太谈谈印度”拉维尼娅用她摹仿铭钦女士时最逗人的腔调学舌道“亲爱的萨拉一定得对皮特金夫人说说法语。小姐的发音是那样完美。不管怎样，她的法语不是在这培育院里学的。她懂法语也算不上什么聪明。她自己说过，她根本没学过法语。那只不过是她顺手捡来的，因为她经常听她爸爸说法语。至于她爸爸，作为一个驻在印度的军官也没什么了不起的”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dear me," said Lavinia, "how we can calculate!" In fact, it was not to be denied that sixteen and four made twenty -- and twenty was an age the most daring were scarcely bold enough to dream of.</div>

And," opening large, convicting eyes, "it takes sixteen years to make you twenty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你是四岁，你就是四岁”她严厉地冲着拉维尼娅说，因为有一回拉维尼娅——这是无可抵赖的——打了洛蒂一巴掌，骂“臭娃”，“但是明年你就是五岁，后年六岁。而且”她瞪着一双令人信服的大眼睛“只要再过十六年，就是二十岁”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the younger children adored Sara. More than once she had been known to have a tea party, made up of these despised ones, in her own room. And Emily had been played with, and Emily's own tea service used -- the one with cups which held quite a lot of much-sweetened weak tea and had blue flowers on them. No one had seen such a very real doll's tea set before. From that afternoon Sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen by the entire alphabet class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，年龄较小的孩子都崇拜萨拉。大家都知道，她曾不止一次在自己的房间里举行茶话会，组织那些受轻视的孩子参加。埃米莉也被拿来一起玩，而且用的是埃米莉自己的那套茶具― 这套茶具的茶杯上有蓝色的花朵图案，杯里盛着大量加糖较多的淡茶。谁也没见过这么逼真的洋娃娃用的成套茶具。从那天下午起，萨拉就被整个学字母的初级班尊崇为女神和女皇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lottle Legh worshipped her to such an extent that if Sara had not been a motherly person, she would have found her tiresome. Lottie had been sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not imagine what else to do with her. Her young mother had died, and as the child had been treated like a favorite doll or a very spoiled pet monkey or lap dog ever since the first hour of her life, she was a very appalling little creature. When she wanted anything or did not want anything she wept and howled; and, as she always wanted the things she could not have, and did not want the things that were best for her, her shrill little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of the house or another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛蒂·利崇拜萨拉到如此地步，以致如果萨拉不是个慈母般的人儿，就会对她感到厌烦了。洛蒂是被她那好发奇想的年轻爸爸送到学校来的，他想不出除此以外还能拿她怎么办。她妈妈年轻时就死了，这孩子一生下来就像人们心爱的洋娃娃、宠坏了的小猴子和叭儿狗那样被溺爱着，因此她是个会闹得骇人的小家伙。当她要或者不要什么东西时，她又哭又嚎；由于她偏偏总是要那不可能给她的东西，而不要那最有益于她的东西，所以经常能听到她那令人惊然的小嗓门儿在这栋房子的某一部分升级到哀号。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first time Sara took her in charge was one morning when, on passing a sitting room, she heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia trying to suppress the angry wails of some child who, evidently, refused to be silenced. She refused so strenuously indeed that Miss Minchin was obliged to almost shout -- in a stately and severe manner -- to make herself heard.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she had found out that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person who ought to be pitied and made much of.

<div class="line_en">Sara stood by the howling furious child for a few moments, and looked down at her without saying anything. Then she sat down flat on the floor beside her and waited. Except for Lottie's angry screams, the room was quite quiet. This was a new state of affairs for little Miss Legh, who was accustomed, when she screamed, to hear other people protest and implore and command and coax by turns. To lie and kick and shriek, and find the only person near you not seeming to mind in the least, attracted her attention. She opened her tight-shut streaming eyes to see who this person was. And it was only another little girl. But it was the one who owned Emily and all the nice things. And she was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely thinking. Having paused for a few seconds to find this out, Lottie thought she must begin again, but the quiet of the room and of Sara's odd, interested face made her first howl rather half-hearted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉在这嚎哭、撒野的孩子旁边站了一会儿，俯视着她，没有说任何话。然后她在地板上径直坐下来，守在旁边等着。除了洛蒂愤怒的尖叫，房间里寂然无声。对利小姐来说这可是个新情况，她本来习惯于在哭叫时听到别人轮番地进行谴责、恳求、命令、劝诱。现在躺在地上乱踢乱叫，却发现身旁唯一的人似乎一点儿都不在乎，这情况吸引了她的注意力。她睁开紧闭着的泪眼，想看看旁边这个人是谁。看到的却只是个小姑娘。不过那是拥有埃米莉以及所有那些好玩意儿的那个小姑娘，她正镇定地望着自己，一副若有所思的样子。洛蒂暂停了几秒钟，本来是为了看看是怎么一回事，现在觉得必须重新开始，但是宁静的房间以及萨拉那奇特、关注并平和的面容使洛蒂的第一声嚎哭有点半心半意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She went to heaven," she said. "But I am sure she comes out sometimes to see me -- though I don't see her. So does yours. Perhaps they can both see us now. Perhaps they are both in this room."</div>

<div class="line_en">This was so unexpected that it was astounding. Lottie actually dropped her legs, gave a wriggle, and lay and stared. A new idea will stop a crying child when nothing else will. Also it was true that while Lottie disliked Miss Minchin, who was cross, and Miss Amelia, who was foolishly indulgent, she rather liked Sara, little as she knew her. She did not want to give up her grievance, but her thoughts were distracted from it, so she wriggled again, and, after a sulky sob, said, "Where is she?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一点是如此出乎预料，令人惊奇。洛蒂真的放下了她的双腿，扭动了一下身子，躺在那儿睁大眼睛望着。在别无他法的情况中，一个新念头可以阻止儿童啼哭。还有一个真实情况：洛蒂不喜欢铭钦女士，她太粗暴，也不喜欢阿米莉亚小姐，她只知道愚蠢地纵容，但她很喜欢萨拉，虽然还不怎么了解对方。她并不打算放弃诉苦，但是她的思想已被岔开，于是又扭了一下身子，赌气地抽噎了一下说“她到哪里去了”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sara paused a moment. Because she had been told that her mamma was in heaven, she had thought a great deal about the matter, and her thoughts had not been quite like those of other people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉停顿片刻。因为她曾被告知妈妈在天堂里，关于这事儿她想过很多，而她的想法并不跟其他人的完全一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lottle sat bolt upright, and looked about her. She was a pretty, little, curly-headed creature, and her round eyes were like wet forget-me-nots. If her mamma had seen her during the last half-hour, she might not have thought her the kind of child who ought to be related to an angel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛蒂坐得笔直，望着四下。她是个漂亮的长着满头鬈发的小家伙，一双圆眼睛像露湿的勿忘我花。如果她妈妈在此前半小时内看到了她的胡闹，恐怕就会明白她的孩子不是那种可以称为天使的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sara went on talking. Perhaps some people might think that what she said was rather like a fairy story, but it was all so real to her own imagination that Lottie began to listen in spite of herself. She had been told that her mamma had wings and a crown, and she had been shown pictures of ladies in beautiful white nightgowns, who were said to be angels. But Sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely country where real people were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉继续讲着。可能有人会认为她所讲的有点儿像童话故事，但是在她的幻想中，却都是那样真实，洛蒂开始不由自主地听下去。人家曾告诉萨拉她妈妈长着翅膀，头戴花冠，她还看到过贵妇淑女们穿着美丽的白色睡袍的像片，据说她们都是天使。而萨拉现在讲的似乎是一处可爱的国土上的真实故事，那里居住着真实的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There are fields and fields of flowers," she said, forgetting herself, as usual, when she began, and talking rather as if she were in a dream, "fields and fields of lilies -- and when the soft wind blows over them it wafts the scent of them into the air -- and everybody always breathes it, because the soft wind is always blowing. And little children run about in the lily fields and gather armfuls of them, and laugh and make little wreaths. And the streets are shining. And people are never tired, however far they walk. They can float anywhere they like. And there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city, but they are low enough for the people to go and lean on them, and look down on to the earth and smile, and send beautiful messages."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那里一片片田野上开满了鲜花”她说，像往常那样，一讲起来就忘掉了自己，讲着讲着就好像沉醉在梦幻之中—“一片片田野上尽是百合花——当柔和的风吹过，空中飘送着花香——人人呼吸着花香，因为柔和的风总是不停地吹着。小孩子们在百合花的田野里奔跑着，采了一抱一抱的百合花，边嬉笑边编结小花环。街道上亮光光的。不论走多远也不会感到疲劳。他们可以飞到任何爱去的地方。城市的围墙由珍珠和黄金筑成，但是城墙相当低，便于人们凭依在上俯瞰人间，并微笑着传送美好的祝愿”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatsoever story she had begun to tell, Lottie would, no doubt, have stopped crying, and been fascinated into listening; but there was no denying that this story was prettier than most others. She dragged herself close to Sara, and drank in every word until the end came -- far too soon. When it did come, she was so sorry that she put up her lip ominously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论萨拉开始讲的是什么故事，毫无疑问洛蒂都会停止哭泣，人迷地聆听，但是不可否认，这比其他大多数故事更美丽动听。她把身体挪近萨拉，全神倾听着每句话，直到故事的结尾——这结尾来得太快。当结尾真的到来时，她感到多么遗憾，又不祥地撅起嘴来。">查看中文翻译</div>
