<div class="line_en">When they emerged from the cottage, the wraiths were nowhere to be seen. Dylan looked around her, eyes wide and frightened, and then sighed with relief. There was still the valley to travel through, though, she thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a gloomy morning. The sun was shining brightly, but its rays were unable to break through the thick, swirling mist that coated the landscape. Tristan took a long, measured look around and then glanced back at Dylan, smiling sympathetically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天早上天色阴沉。太阳虽然明亮，阳光却穿不透盘旋山岭、笼罩四野的浓雾。崔斯坦从容不迫地放眼四下打量，然后又看了眼迪伦，同情地笑了笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're nervous." It wasn't a question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你很紧张。”他没有问她，直接就下了断语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded. He walked over to her and grasped both of her hands in his. "Look at me," he commanded. "You don't have to be afraid. I will protect you. I promise." He bent his legs a little so that he could look into her eyes. She tried to hold his gaze, and felt a glow tingle into her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点点头。他走到她身边，把她的手攥在自己手里，“看着我，”他以命令的口吻说，“你不用害怕，我会保护你的。我保证。”他稍微弯了弯腿好直视迪伦的双眼。她尽力接住他的目光，感到脸颊上有些发烫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan gazed at the mist and comprehension dawned. "I made this?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're cute when you blush," he said, laughing as his words caused the blush to go into overdrive. "Come on," he said, letting go of one hand as he turned, but keeping hold of the other and gently tugging her forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你脸红的时候很可爱。”他说。这番话让她的脸红得更厉害了，惹得他又笑起来，“来吧。”他说，转过身放开了她的一只手，但仍抓着另一只，温柔地牵着她向前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Dylan stumbled after him, she was dimly aware of the mist thinning as the sun's rays finally began to fight their way through. She thought she understood why, and so her blush was slow to fade. Two minutes later she had convinced herself that his words were nothing more than a strategy -- to lighten her mood and evaporate the mist, lessening the risk from the demons. Still, his hand remained tightly folded around hers as he led her on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦在他身后磕磕绊绊地走着，隐隐约约感觉雾霭正在变薄，太阳的光线开始奋力透出来。她觉得自己知道这是为什么，所以脸上的红晕一时半会还褪不下去。两分钟后，她又确信他的话不过是一种策略而已—让她的心情放松，让阳光蒸发掉浓雾，减少来自魔鬼的风险。不过，在他领着她前行时，手仍然紧紧地和她的手扣在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See those two hills over there?" Dylan nodded. "The valley we have to pass through lies between them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看见那边的两座山了吗？”迪伦点点头，“我们要穿过的山谷就夹在那两座山中间。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's a long way," Dylan said dubiously. It was already mid-morning, and the hills looked fairly far away. Surely it would already be dusk before they reached them? She certainly didn't want to be caught down there in the dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有很长的路要走。”迪伦疑惑地说。早晨已经过半了，而那两座山看起来还相当遥远。在他们到达之前肯定已到黄昏时分了吧？她当然不想在一片黑暗中被捉到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the top of the first hill, Tristan paused and surveyed the landscape. He fixed his gaze on something to the left and pointed towards it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在第一座山峰的峰顶，崔斯坦停下步子，侦察了一下地形。他的目光聚焦在左侧，手朝那里指了指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Optical illusion, it's much closer than it looks. We'll be there in about an hour. We should be fine as long as your good mood holds out." He smiled down at her and squeezed her hand. Dylan felt as if the sun shone a little brighter. How humiliating, to have your emotions made so obvious, she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只是视觉幻觉而已，比看上去要近得多，我们一个小时就能到那儿。只要你的好心情能保持住，我们就会安然无恙的。”他低头笑着看她，捏了捏她的手。迪伦感觉阳光似乎立刻亮了一点点，自己心里的感情竟然被周围天气出卖得一览无遗了，太丢脸了，她想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From here, the two hills guarding the valley appeared to tower above her. Tristan had been right, they seemed much closer now. All that stood between them and the hills was a flat expanse of marshland. Large puddles shimmered at intervals, and reed-beds grew in sporadic clusters. Dylan internally cursed, imagining the cold mucky water that would soon be seeping into her socks. She glanced at Tristan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这里看过去，那两座护卫着幽谷的山峰巍然耸立。崔斯坦说得没错，它们现在看起来似乎近多了。他们和山峰间只隔了一片平坦的沼泽。大水坑里不时闪烁着微光，长满芦苇的河滩星罗棋布。想到又冰冷又肮脏的水很快就会灌进袜子里，迪伦心里暗暗叫苦，她看了一眼崔斯坦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A narrow path wound its way down the side of the hill, wide enough for only one of them to negotiate at a time. Tristan led the way, finally letting go of her hand as he picked his way over small stones and clumps of weeds. Dylan walked slowly and cautiously behind him, leaning back slightly to compensate for the slope and taking tiny, shuffling steps as she sought out safe footholds. She held her hands out away from her sides, both to help keep her balance and to save her if she fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山腰上只有一条羊肠小道蜿蜒而下，窄得一次只能穿过去一个人。崔斯坦在前带路，他在石块和草丛间择路而行，终于放开了她的手。迪伦慢慢地小心翼翼地跟在他身后，她下陡坡时身子微微向后仰，一小步一小步蹭着地皮走，寻找着安全的着地点。她伸开胳膊，既为了保持身体平衡，同时也是为摔倒时好自我保护。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took them about half an hour to make their way to the bottom of the hill, and Dylan sighed with relief when the ground evened out beneath her feet and she was able to stretch her legs and take longer, bounding steps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们辛苦跋涉了大概半个小时，终于走到了山脚下。脚下的路平坦起来，迪伦长呼了一口气，现在她可以迈开大步朝前跃进了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe we should just take a little rest here?" she suggested, hoping to postpone trudging into the muck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要不我们就在这儿歇一会儿吧？”她建议道，希望能拖延一会儿走进这堆烂泥地里的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave her a withering look and she sighed. Plunging her hands into her pockets, she rocked back on her heels, reluctant to take the first steps forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他瞪了她一眼，她只能叹口气，把手伸进口袋里，踮着脚跟朝后晃了一下，不乐意迈出第一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's a great idea." He frowned at her, unimpressed. "We can just wait here till mid-afternoon and then hit the valley at nightfall. Live dangerously, why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是个好主意。”他对着她不以为然地皱了皱眉，“我们可以在这儿等到下午，然后夜探深谷。玩的就是心跳，为什么不呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The marsh was not more than a couple of miles across, but carving a path through the large puddles and reeds, and slogging through the mud, that at times sucked her down below her ankles, was hard work and they made slow progress. Tristan seemed to have much less trouble with the mud than Dylan did. His feet were able to find the firm ground more easily, and even when she trod in the same spot as him, she was sure that she sank deeper. It stank as well. It wasn't like anything she'd ever smelled before. It was a putrid and wafted up with each step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿过整个沼泽只有十几英里的路，但其间要穿过大水坑和芦苇丛探着路走，还要蹚过那些烂泥，它们会不时吸住她的脚踝，让她动弹不得，所以她走得异常艰辛、缓慢。崔斯坦对付烂泥似乎比迪伦游刃有余得多，他轻而易举就可以找到坚硬的地面下脚。哪怕他们踩在一样的地方，迪伦都觉得自己要比他陷得更深一点。那里还臭气熏天，而且是她从没闻过的一种臭味，他们每走一步就会飘来一阵腐烂的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay, it was just a suggestion," Dylan grumbled as she took the first step into the marsh. Her trainer squelched ominously. She winced, but her foot stayed warm and dry. Not for long, she thought to herself as she continued to trudge along.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，我不过是提个建议而已嘛。”迪伦小声嘟囔着，走进了沼泽。她的跑鞋发出吧唧吧唧的声音，给人一种不祥的预感。她眉头紧锁，不过脚还是又干又暖的。她一边继续艰难跋涉，一边心里想，要不了多久。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't suppose a piggyback is part of your guide duties?" she asked hopefully.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦！”她高声叫了起来，尽管他离她不过几米的距离。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About halfway across, they hit a patch that was boggier than the rest. Dylan's foot sank down almost to her knee in the sludge and when she tried to jerk herself free, nothing happened. She rocked backwards and then threw her weight forwards. Still nothing. She tried twice more and then, panting, was forced to admit defeat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="行程过半后，他们脚下的路比刚才的更加泥泞。迪伦的脚陷在泥浆里，几乎已经没到了膝盖。她努力想要把脚拔出来，但是无济于事。她的身子先是后仰再往前倾，还是不起任何作用。她又试了两次，最后一边喘着粗气，一边不得不认输了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She raised both arms in a gesture of hopelessness. "Stuck."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她举起双臂，做出无能为力的手势，“动不了了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't be funny, get me out!" She put her hands on her hips, a cross look on her face. He grinned and shook his head. Dylan decided to try a different tack. She dropped her arms, hung her head and looked up at him from underneath her lashes, pouting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别耍贫嘴了，把我弄出去！”她双手叉腰，脸上一脸愤怒。他大笑着摇了摇头。迪伦决定改变策略。她放下了胳膊，垂着头，噘着嘴，睁着大眼看着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned and looked at her. "What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转过身看着她，“什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A wicked look came across his face. "And what do you want me to do about it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的脸上露出一丝坏坏的表情，“你想让我帮你什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed louder, but began to slosh his way over to her. "You're pathetic," he joked. He grabbed hold of both of her arms, locked his knees and braced his body, then leaned back and heaved. Dylan heard a sucking, squelching sound but her feet remained firmly stuck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的笑声更响亮了，不过还是蹚着泥水走了过来，“真可怜啊。”他打趣道。他抓着她的两只胳膊，膝盖保持不动，全身肌肉绷紧，然后身体后仰，使劲地把她往上拽。迪伦听到类似于吮吸似的吧唧声，但是自己的脚还是纹丝不动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我就是踩上去了。”她恨恨地说，有点被他嘲讽的神情激怒了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan dropped his grip on her arms and took a step forward. He wound his arms around her waist, hugging her tightly, their full bodies touching. Dylan froze a little at the close contact, her pulse racing. She hoped he couldn't hear it. Squeezing her hard, he pulled backwards. Dylan felt the mud start to loosen its grip on her legs. With a disgusting, plopping sound, the bog finally released her. Without the marsh to hold her, Tristan's pulling launched her forward. She let out a sound that was a cross between a yelp and a cackle as he staggered backwards, trying to keep his balance. Splodges of muddy water splashed up and spattered their faces and hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦松开了她的胳膊，往前走了一步。他双臂搂着她的腰，紧紧抱住她，两个人的身体贴在了一起。如此近距离的接触让迪伦的身子微微发紧，脉搏狂跳不止。她希望他什么都没听到。他搂紧她之后，身子向后使劲拉。迪伦感到腿上的淤泥开始松动，随着一声恶心的吧嗒声，这片烂泥地终于放开了她。没有了沼泽的吸附，崔斯坦这一拔让她的身子向前倾去。她朝后面踉跄了几步，想尽力保持身体平衡，喉咙里随之发出怪声，既像是惊声尖叫又像是咯咯地笑。污水飞溅，他们的脸上和头发上全是泥点子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bloody hell," he panted. "How did you do this?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“该死，”他喘着气说，“你是怎么搞成这样的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan's arms tightened around her as he tried to stop the two of them from falling into the marsh. Taking a couple of awkward steps backwards, he finally managed to steady them. Looking down, he saw Dylan's mud-freckled face staring up at him and he was caught for a second in the dazzling green of her eyes as she laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦的双臂紧紧搂着她，挣扎着免得两人一起摔进淤泥里。踉踉跄跄地往后退了十几步后，他们终于站定了。崔斯坦一低头看到满脸泥点子的迪伦正在仰头看着自己。他看到她笑了，也看到了那双令人迷醉的碧眼中的自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next instant, he had released her. He stepped away and looked off towards the hills. Dylan stared at him, confused. What had that been? She had thought he'd wanted to kiss her, but now he didn't even seem to want to look at her. It was very puzzling, and not a little embarrassing. Had she just made a fool of herself? She wasn't even sure. She stared at the only safe place: the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一刻，他却放开了她。他走到一边去，眼睛转向了那些山峰。迪伦迷茫地看着他。这算什么意思呢？她原以为他会吻她，可现在他却连看也不想看她一眼。真是让人一头雾水，而且太尴尬了。她刚才是不是太丢人现眼了？她心里没谱。她的目光又集中在唯一靠谱的地方—地面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We should get going," he said, his voice oddly rough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们得赶路了。”他说，那声音听起来异常粗鲁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan waded ahead through the bog, trying to put a little distance between them to give him time to think. He was perplexed. For decades, maybe even centuries -- it was hard to accurately count the passage of time in the wasteland -- he had protected and guided souls as they made their journey. In the beginning he had taken the role to heart in a way that had proved impossible to sustain. He had cared for each one, listened to their stories and tried to comfort them over the loss of their lives and futures and, of course, the pain of leaving those they loved behind. Each soul that waved goodbye at the end of the journey had taken a small piece of him with them, torn off a tiny piece of his heart. After a while, he had hardened. He no longer reached out to them, and so they could not get inside him. In the past few years, guiding souls had been little more than a chore. He had spoken as little as possible, and attempted to hide the truth for as long as possible. He had been a cold machine. A sat nav for the dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦先蹚过了这片沼泽，尽力想把两人之间的距离稍稍拉开，好让自己有时间思考。他感到很困惑。几十年来，或许几个世纪以来—在这片荒原很难准确计算流逝的时间—他曾经保护引领着无数的灵魂走完这段旅程。最开始的时候，他扮演的是安慰者的角色，后来证明这种方式不可能维持下去。他曾经关心着每一个灵魂，倾听他们的遭遇，尽力抚慰他们。因为他们失去了生命，也不再有未来，当然还要忍受抛下亲朋挚爱带来的痛苦。每一个在旅途终点对他挥手告别的灵魂都会带走他的一部分，将他的心掰掉一小块。过了一段时间，他变得麻木无情起来。他不再安慰他们，所以他们也不再进入他的心扉。在过去的几年间，引领灵魂对他来说无异于是日常琐事。他尽可能不多说话，能把真相瞒多久就瞒多久。他成了一台冷漠的机器，死者们的卫星导航系统。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right," Dylan mumbled, still slightly dazed. He turned and splodged on, and she traipsed after him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好。”迪伦小声应和，心里还有些怅然若失。他转过身继续蹚着泥泞前行，而她则拖着疲惫的步子跟在后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Held tight in Tristan's embrace, Dylan swayed, not yet sure of her feet and still a little giddy. She grinned up at him, momentarily losing her shyness. He was staring right back at her. The moment deepened and the laughter died in Dylan's throat. Suddenly it was hard to breathe. She drew in shallow gasps and her lips parted slightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦在崔斯坦的怀抱中立足不稳，摇摇晃晃，微微有些目眩。她对着他粲然一笑，在那一瞬间丢下了所有的羞涩。他的目光也在注视着她。时间似乎在这一刻凝固了，迪伦的笑声在喉咙里戛然而止。突然间她感觉呼吸困难，轻轻吸了几口气，微微张开了嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was something more than that. He couldn't define the feeling. Holding her in his arms had caused something inside him to stir. Odd feelings, feelings that had him thinking about her instead of watching the sun lowering dangerously in the sky. He felt almost… human. That couldn't be right, but Tristan had no other word for it. Human.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这种感觉还远不止于此，他说不清这种情愫到底是什么。把她揽进臂弯之后，他的内心深处荡起了波澜。奇怪的感情，这种感情会让他的脑子里只想着她，全然不去注意天上的太阳正在缓慢而危险地落下去。他几乎感觉到了……人性的萌动，这样说当然不准确，但崔斯坦找不出别的词。对，就是人性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This girl had somehow managed to cause his old self to resurface. She had uncovered the truth at an astonishingly early stage, and had accepted it with more maturity than many who had spent a full life on Earth. She treated him like a person. Here in the wasteland that was a rare thing. Souls were too wrapped up in their own demise to even entertain the thought that their guide was someone. She was a soul worth protecting. A soul worth caring about. A soul that he wanted to give a piece of himself to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个女孩已经让曾经的自己又回来了一部分。她在很早的时候就已经发现了事情的真相，然后平静接受，比很多寿终正寝的人都要成熟得多。她把他当人来对待，在这片荒原上，这可是很稀罕的事情。灵魂们都沉浸在自己消亡的悲伤中，甚至不曾想过他们的向导也是人。她是个值得他保护、值得他关怀的灵魂。他愿意为了这个灵魂献出自己身体的一部分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he wasn't. He shook himself awake with a jolt. Feelings like this were dangerous; they could cause him to lose his focus. They put Dylan at risk; they needed to be smothered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan heard the repressed panic in his voice and felt a tight knot it the pit of her stomach. She knew her fear would not help the matter -- in fact, it had the capability to make the situation far worse, but she couldn't smother the emotion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ten minutes more of trudging and the ground started to firm up beneath their feet. The grass held her weight when she stepped on it. She tried to scrape off some of the mud that now coated her trainers and jeans by trailing her feet and rubbing them against the tough stems. She didn't dare stop to do the job properly; she could feel Tristan's impatience to move faster. At last the puddles became less frequent and Dylan was astounded to see, when she looked up, that they were in the shadow of the two hills. Before her was the valley Tristan seemed so concerned about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又艰难跋涉了十分钟，脚下的地面开始变得坚硬，连荒草踩上去都不再柔软。她的脚蹭着韧劲十足的草茎走，尽量想用它们刮掉运动鞋和牛仔裤上粘的一层污泥。她不敢停下脚步好好清理污泥，她能感觉崔斯坦急不可耐地加快了脚步。最后水洼几乎看不到了，迪伦抬头才吃惊地发现他们已经身处两座山峰的阴影之下了。在她前方就是崔斯坦似乎一直忧心忡忡的那条山谷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It looked unremarkable. A fairly wide path wound through it, and the sides sloped gently upward. Dylan had expected a narrow crevice, claustrophobic and tight. She felt relieved, but a glance at Tristan's tense posture had her stomach somersaulting again. She reminded herself that he was a much better judge of where the danger lay. Grimacing, she tried to shuffle faster, closing the distance between them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看起来没有什么与众不同。一条宽阔的路蜿蜒穿过其中，两侧的山坡微微向上倾斜。迪伦原来还以为这条路只是一道罅隙，窄不容身，会让人产生幽闭的恐惧感呢。她刚感觉如释重负，但崔斯坦如临大敌的架势不由得让她心里又翻腾了一下。她提醒自己，他对危险潜伏在何处要比自己看得准多了。愁眉不展的迪伦赶紧加快了脚步，尽力缩短两人之间的距离。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Almost there," he muttered, so low that Dylan wondered if she'd even been meant to hear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快到了。”他嘟囔了一句，声音小得让迪伦疑心这句话是从他心里飘出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan was anxious to begin, wanting to dash through as quickly as possible, but Tristan paused on the threshold to the valley. He seemed to be bracing himself. Dylan eyed him surreptitiously. Was he thinking about the other souls he'd taken through this place, some that he'd lost? How many had walked this path with Tristan and not made it to the other side? Feeling nervous, Dylan stretched out her fingers and curled them around his left hand. She smiled timidly up at him and squeezed. He returned the smile tightly and then gazed back down the valley, looking almost defiant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦心急火燎地想要尽全力冲出去，但崔斯坦却在山谷的入口停了下来。他似乎正在为即将到来的一场恶战做好准备。迪伦狐疑地看着他，他是不是想起了当年他带到这里的那个灵魂呢？有多少灵魂跟崔斯坦一起走上了这条路却没有走出去呢？迪伦越想越紧张，不由得手指张开，勾住了他的左手。她怯生生地冲他一笑，紧紧攥着他的手。崔斯坦对她僵笑了一下，然后目光又转回山谷，眼神中带着无畏。">查看中文翻译</div>
