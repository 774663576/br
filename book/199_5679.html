<div class="line_en">The storm had blown itself out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast. A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，风暴停了，不过礼堂的天花板上仍然一片愁云惨雾。当哈利、罗恩和赫敏一边吃早饭一边研究他们这学期的课程表时，他们头顶上空正翻滚着大团大团青灰色的浓云。在同一张桌上，弗雷德、乔治和李·乔丹与他们隔着几个座位，正在讨论用什么神奇法术使自己年龄变大，然后蒙混过关，参加三强争霸赛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively, Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap -- Neville almost always forgot to pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy's eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn't even got his letter?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，他们头顶上突然传来一阵瑟瑟的声音，一百只猫头鹰从敞开的窗口飞进来，给大家捎来了早上的邮件。哈利本能地抬起头，然而在一大堆棕色和灰色之间，看不见丝毫白色的影子。猫头鹰在桌子上方盘旋，寻找信件和包裹的收件人。一只黄褐色的大猫头鹰朝纳威·隆巴顿这边落下来，把一只包裹扔到他的膝盖上——纳威几乎每次收拾行李都丢三落四。在礼堂的另一边，德拉科·马尔福的猫头鹰降落在他的肩膀上，看样子又从家里给他带来了糖果、蛋糕。哈利竭力摆脱他内心沉甸甸的失望感觉，埋下头去继续喝粥。难道海德薇出了意外，小天狼星没有收到他的信？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights," said Hermione haughtily.</div>

<div class="line_en">His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利一直心事重重，当同学们走过潮湿的菜地，来到三号温室时，他还是愁眉不展。不过他终于回过神来了，因为斯普劳特教授给全班同学看一种植物，哈利还从未见过这么丑陋的东西呢。实际上，它们不像植物，倒更像是黑黢黢、黏糊糊的大鼻涕虫，笔直地从土壤里冒了出来。而且一个个都在微微蠕动，身上还有许多闪闪发亮的大鼓包，里面似乎都是液体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”西莫·斐尼甘用厌恶的口气问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bubotubers," Professor Sprout told them briskly. "They need squeezing. You will collect the pus --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"This'll keep Madam Pomfrey happy," said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. "An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这下庞弗雷夫人该高兴了。”斯普劳特教授用塞子堵住最后一个瓶子，说道，“巴波块茎的脓水，是治疗顽固性粉刺的最好药物。这样就可以阻止学生用过激手段去除他们的青春痘了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pus, Finnigan, pus," said Professor Sprout, "and it's extremely valuable, so don't waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon-hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“脓水，斐尼甘，脓水，”斯普劳特教授说，“它有极高的价值，千万不要浪费。听着，你们要把脓水收集到这些瓶子里。戴上你们的龙皮手套，未经稀释的巴波块茎脓水，会对皮肤造成不同寻常的伤害。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="挤块茎的过程令人恶心，却也使人产生一种奇怪的满足感。每当一个鼓包被挤破时，都会喷出一大股黏稠的、黄绿色的液体，并发出一种刺鼻的汽油味。他们按照斯普劳特教授的吩咐，把这些液体收集在瓶子里，到了快下课的时候，他们已经收集了好几瓶子了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格站在小木屋的门外，一只手牵着他那条巨大的猎狗牙牙的颈圈。他脚边的地上，放着几只敞开的木箱子，牙牙呜呜叫着，使劲地挣着颈圈，看样子是想仔细调查一下箱子里的东西。当他们走近时，一种很奇怪的咔啦咔啦声传进他们耳朵，间或还有微弱的爆炸声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid's small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵低沉浑厚的钟声从城堡传来，越过潮湿的场地，下课了，同学们纷纷散去。赫奇帕奇的学生们走上石阶，去上变形课。格兰芬多的学生去的是另一个方向，他们顺着缓缓下坡的草坪，走向禁林边缘的海格的小木屋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Eurgh" just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Harry's opinion. They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恶心”一词正好也概括了哈利对这种炸尾螺的印象。它们活像是变了形、去了壳的大龙虾，白灰灰、黏糊糊的，模样非常可怕，许多只脚横七竖八地伸出来，看不见脑袋在哪里。每只箱子里大约有一百条，每条都有六英寸左右长，互相叠在一起爬来爬去，昏头昏脑地撞在箱子壁上。它们还发出一股非常强烈的臭鱼烂虾的气味。时不时地，一条炸尾螺的尾部会射出一些火花，然后随着啪的一声轻响，炸尾螺就会向前推进几英寸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard. Hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew only too well -- he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are preoccupied, my dear," she said mournfully to Harry. "My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas… most difficult… I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass… and perhaps sooner than you think…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你有心事，我亲爱的，”她悲戚戚地对哈利说，“我心灵的目光穿越你勇敢的脸，看到了你内心烦躁不安的灵魂。我很遗憾地告诉你，你的担心不是毫无根据的。我看到你前面的日子充满艰辛…非常艰难…我担心你害怕的东西真的会到来…也许比你想象的还要快…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的声音渐渐低了下去，最后变得耳语一般。罗恩朝哈利翻了翻眼睛，哈利面无表情地望着他。特里劳妮教授轻飘飘地从他们身边掠过，坐在炉火前的一把很大的带翅靠背扶手椅上，面对着全班同学。拉文德·布朗和帕瓦蒂·佩蒂尔特别崇拜特里劳妮教授，都坐在离她很近的蒲团上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars," she said. "The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的，我们应该来研究星星了。”特里劳妮教授说，“行星的运动及其所显示的神秘征兆，只有那些懂得天际舞蹈舞步规则的人，才能参透其中奥秘。人类命运可以通过行星的辐射光来破译，这些光互相交融…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Harry's thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney's rambling talks on fortune-telling never held him exactly spellbound -- though he couldn't help thinking about what she had just said to him. "I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而哈利的思绪飘到了别处。发出香味的炉火总是使他感到昏昏欲睡，特里劳妮教授翻来覆去地念叨着关于算命的话，从来没有真正把他吸引住——不过他忍不住想起她刚才对他说的话：“我担心你害怕的东西真的会到来…”">查看中文翻译</div>

He had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner.</div>

Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody's heavily guarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen, but refused to answer Daily Prophet questions about why he had involved the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene.</div>
