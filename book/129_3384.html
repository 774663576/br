<div class="line_en">Any African hospital is a shock by Western standards. There is nothing here to remind us of the hushed tones and pastel hues of our institutions. The unpleasant and offensive aspects of the human body are not dealt with in side wards and behind screens; it is very much a public place. When a man is ill, his whole family insist on being there, cooking there, doing the washing, nursing the children and conducting domestic affairs in strident voices as if at home. There are blaring radios, hawkers peddling a hundred forms of trash, long queues of swaddled women and downcast men all clutching pieces of paper like charms. Male nurses cut through them, intent on their own purposes, oblivious to the clutching hands and wailing voices. The environs are an ecological disaster. Every leaf has been plucked to wipe hands, every twig to feed fires, every blade of grass has been pounded to death and the lunar landscape is dotted with neat piles of excrement on which furtive dogs feed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The great trouble with hepatitis, it seemed, was that it could easily become chronic and dog me to the end of my stay. It was therefore important to identify which of the several varieties I had contracted. This could only be done at Yaounde. Here there was also a proper dentist who could produce a more serviceable dental repair until I got back to England. I was encouraged to seek this by the obvious distress of Westerners when my teeth flew out spontaneously in the midst of eating, talking or other forms of ordinary activity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Financial disaster loomed on all fronts. Money was still not getting through to me. The bank was incapable of following the simplest instructions and my indebtedness to the mission was becoming something of an embarrassment. Now I had to face further expenditure on vehicle and personal repairs. In desperation I sent a telegram to my college asking them to advance me £500 to get me out of difficulties. If they could cable it to me, I would pick it up at the British Embassy in Yaounde.</div>

<div class="line_en">My physical collapse had come at a relatively convenient time. The main ritual season was over and the harvest, which I particularly wanted to witness, had not yet begun. I had about three weeks to refit and return to the field. With luck I might just make it. Gritting my dentures, I set off for Yaounde.</div>

<div class="line_en">Being in a delicate condition, I opted for taking a couchette and damn the expense. This was surprisingly clean and comfortable and in a style that seemed to hail from the Tierra del Fuego Railroad Co. of about 1910. My chances of a good night, however, were destroyed by the efforts of the attendant to install me in a compartment together with a formidable Lebanese woman and her willowy daughter. The attendant pointed me to a bunk and I stowed my kit and settled down to sleep. Abruptly he was seized by this Levantine virago. "No man sleeps in the same room as my daughter till she is married," she hissed. "She is a virgin," she elaborated. We both regarded her with renewed interest. I attempted to disclaim all ambitions upon the physical charms of her offspring. The girl giggled. The attendant ranted. I was ignored.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for me, I limped off down the corridor where I found almost all the couchettes empty and chose one at random. The attendant regarded this as a vile defection and favoured me with his views on the Lebanese at great length until I bribed him to simply go away. At intervals throughout the night I would hear the door of the compartment down the corridor open as the lady sentinel spotted her enemy passing and hurled abuse after him. The next morning as we pulled into Yaounde, he was dedicating himself to preventing her getting a porter, while she attempted to pour her drinking water over him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我则一跛一跛沿走道前行，发现几乎所有卧铺都是空的，随便挑了一个睡上去。服务员视此为恶意背叛，用瞪视黎巴嫩妇人的恶狠眼神瞪了我许久，直到我拿钱贿赂才打发了他。整晚，我都听到那位黎巴嫩“哨兵”只要瞥见敌人经过，便拉开车厢门对他大声咒骂。第二天抵达雅温得，服务员死命阻挠那位妇人找行李推伕，她则企图泼他茶水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An undignified tussle took place in the doorway, ending in great quantities of spitting. The girl and I exchanged looks of mute sympathy. It was time to be dogmatic and I roused myself with difficulty. The woman seemed to fear an attempt to assault her daughter from the rear and leaped to interpose herself with clenched fists. Profiting from her distraction, the attendant seized her from behind and began dragging her howling into the corridor. A large crowd, consisting largely of travelling policemen, gathered to watch with serene detachment, while meaner spirits urged the combatants on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随即他们在车厢门口毫不体面地扭打，互相大啐口水。我与那位女孩沉默交换同情眼神。该摆出决断的样子了，我吃力起身。妇人似乎担心我从背后偷袭她的女儿，紧握拳头，奋力扑到我的面前。服务员趁她不注意，一把抓住她的背，将尖声大叫的她拖到走道。众人群集围观，不少是出外旅行的警察，漠然袖手，一些可恶的观众则鼓噪叫他们打架。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I rendezvoused with French friends, whom I'd met when I'd first arrived, at the usual bar and we gossiped about what had happened to whom. Most of the absentees seemed to have fallen foul of the extremely virulent venereal diseases that haunt West Africa, social life being so dull that fornication is the chief distraction. The souvenir vendors, to my horror, recognized me as the one who had passed through without buying anything the first time and were determined not to let me escape again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和上次在雅温得认识的法国朋友约在老酒吧见面，闲聊大家的近况。多数失踪面孔都是感染了肆虐西非洲的致命病毒性病。非洲社交生活贫乏，通奸是最大消遣。我惊恐发现那些纪念品小贩还记得我是那个什么都没买的人，决心这一次不让我漏网。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whereas when I first arrived in Cameroon I had been greatly impressed by the ugliness and squalor of Yaounde, I now saw the city as a haven of beauty and good taste, brimming over with the comforts of civilization. Something drastic seemed to have happened to my standards in the few intervening months. I found myself also unmoved by rather shocking collocations of wealth and poverty. As we sat at the café, in mainly white company, a small child stood on the pavement and, driven by I know not what path to political radicalism at so tender an age, began to rail against foreigners. The clientele of the café found this hugely amusing and threw coins that the child scrabbled in the dirt to pick up.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was soon installed in my friends' flat and noted once again how different are the priorities of French and English young people. The unattached English or Americans one meets in such circumstances live either off the land or out of tins, but the French insist on their cuisine. Their lives, when not teaching, consisted of motor rallies in the jungle, parties in the Embassy area and touristic enterprises. One was an enthusiastic taxidermist and specialized in the stuffing of pangolins (scaly ant-eaters). These, it seems, are extraordinarily difficult beasts to kill and he was always experimenting in new ways of doing them to death. It was not unusual to find the bath full of remarkably lively pangolins that he had purportedly just drowned, or the lid being forced off the freezer by pangolins he had "frozen to death".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很快住进朋友的公寓，再次发现英、法两国年轻人的生活优先顺序大不相同。生活在非洲，独立的英美人士不是自己种植，就是吃罐头食物，法国人却坚持法式料理。不教书时，他们的生活就是到丛林赛车、到大使馆区参加派对，或者从事其他观光冒险。他们当中有一人酷爱剥制动物标本，尤其擅长剥制穿山甲。据说穿山甲很难杀死，因此他整日忙着实验各种杀死穿山甲的新方法。有时澡盆里浮着他宣称刚淹死的穿山甲，有时冰箱冷冻库门关不上，里面是他“冻僵”的穿山甲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By a strange coincidence, the new doctor at the Polyclinique turned out to be known to me, being the boyfriend of the sister of an old friend, and we had once met in a bar in La Rochelle. It was extremely comforting to find the world such a small place and working on such very African principles of extended kinship. He arranged for me to have blood tests, a process that I regarded with somewhat mixed feelings. It seemed counterproductive to have needles stuck in me as the cure for having needles stuck in me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was forced to spend two weeks in Yaounde while my teeth were being repaired and took full advantage of it to eat meat, bread and, on one exquisite day, a cream cake. (When I returned to England I adopted a policy of eating two a day until I regained normal weight.) There is no more cheering experience than being able to walk about again after an illness. Life was full of hedonistic pleasures. I went to dinner with a man who ran the local tobacco company and could not explain my sudden, all-enveloping sense of well-being until I realized that I was sitting in an upholstered armchair for the first time in four months. In Dowayoland, I sat on rocks or on the Chief's rickety deckchairs, at the mission on stiff-backed chairs. There were cinemas too, with various luxurious features, such as systems whereby you could hear the soundtrack at the back without having to rely on word of mouth passed from the front of the house. Best of all, they had roofs not made of corrugated iron so that a heavy shower did not obliterate everything.</div>

Hugely exaggerated reports of my maiming and disfigurement had reached them via the Foreign Office in London, and a member of the Embassy was even toying with the idea of going beyond the confines of the capital to look for me. Characteristically they went into elaborate explanations of the many ways in which they couldn't help me. They did arrange for me to jump the queue to see the dentist, but denied firmly all knowledge of money.</div>

<div class="line_en">But this euphoria was short-lived. Life for the Whites centred on the various bars where they forgathered in the evening to share each others' boredom and complain about Yaounde.

<div class="line_en">I dropped in at the hospital to pick up the results of my blood tests. The first report informed me I was suffering from "sample lost". The second diagnosed "no reagent for this test". Predictably, it had been a waste of time. However, I felt much improved physically and could pronounce most of the basic sounds of the English language with my new teeth. Only my finances had suffered. It was not for several more months that the Embassy discovered that money had in fact been sent to me and was lying in a drawer somewhere. I was impressed by their tact in sending me an invitation to the Queen's birthday party so that it arrived the week after the event; on the back someone had written, The ambassador will not be surprised if you are unable to come."</div>

<div class="line_en">I regained N'gaoundere without incident, rendezvousing with Jon and Jeannie for a lift back to Poli. Reinforcements had just arrived from the States in the form of the Blue family whose patriarch, Walter, was to teach at the mission school. He, Jon and I rapidly became soul-mates. Walter, soon established as Vulch thanks to the locals' rendering of his name as "vulture", was a Times crossword addict and spent tortured hours wrestling with them on the veranda, groaning and whooping in alternating despair and exultation. He was also highly musical and soon acquired exclusive rights to a wizened and wheezy piano that had suffered much from damp and termites; it was only much later when he gained access to a more finely tuned instrument that I realized that he could play. His wife Jacqui was the perfect foil, firmly in charge of practical matters: making clothes, keeping hens, hitting pieces of wood with hammers, producing children that Vulch would dandle absently while solving a crossword. Through the house passed a constant stream of visitors; they always seemed glad of more. Arriving from the bush, one never knew quite who would be in residence, luggage laid out among the seething children, cats, dogs and chameleons that variously constituted the ménage.</div>
