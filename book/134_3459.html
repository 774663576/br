<div class="line_en">Therese could not find out what kind of car he had, because the cars were locked in separate garages, and though she had a view of the garages from the sunroom, she did not see him come out that morning. Neither did they see him at lunchtime.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese remembered that they had promised to exchange flower bulbs. She remembered a long conversation in the car one day about bulbs that had cemented their friendship. Carol was incredibly patient to the last. One would never have guessed, seeing Carol sitting on Mrs. French's sofa with the little glass Mrs. French kept filling, that she was in a hurry to get away. Mrs. French kissed them both on the cheek when they said good-by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝想起来她们曾经说过以后要交换种花的心得，她还想起来有天她们在车子里聊种花聊了很久，用种花这件事把彼此的友谊联结起来。现在，卡罗尔更是展现出了高度的耐心，她端坐在沙发上，手里拿着玻璃酒杯，弗兰奇太太不断往杯里斟酒，从外表上绝对猜不出她正急着要离开。她们和弗兰奇太太道别时，弗兰奇太太还吻了她们两人的脸颊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From Denver, they took a highway northward toward Wyoming. They stopped for coffee at the kind of place they always liked, an ordinary restaurant with a counter and a juke box. They put nickels into the juke box, but it was not the same as before. Therese knew it would not be the same for the rest of the trip, though Carol talked of going to Washington even yet, and perhaps up into Canada. Therese could feel that Carol's goal was New York.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们从丹佛沿一条高速公路朝北，先往怀俄明前进。沿路还在一个风格两人都喜欢的餐厅停下来喝咖啡。餐厅其实很普通，有柜台和点唱机，她们往点唱机里面投了五分钱点歌。不过整个感觉已经和以前不一样了，虽然卡罗尔口里还说着要开到华盛顿，或者往北开到加拿大，但特芮丝知道，接下来的这段旅程已经不一样了。特芮丝清楚地感觉到，卡罗尔的目的地是纽约。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They spent the first night in a tourist camp that was built like a circle of tepees. While they were undressing, Carol looked up at the ceiling where the tepee poles came to a point, and said boredly, "The trouble some idiots go to," and for some reason it struck Therese as hysterically funny. She laughed until Carol got tired of it and threatened to make her drink a tumbler of brandy, if she didn't stop. And Therese was still smiling, standing by the window with a brandy in her hand, waiting for Carol to come out of the shower, when she saw a car drive up beside the large office tepee and stop. After a moment, the man who had gone into the office came out and looked around in the dark area within the circle of tepees, and it was his prowling step that arrested her attention. She was suddenly sure without seeing his face or even his figure very clearly that he was the detective.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开之后的第一天晚上，两人找了个度假营区投宿，建筑物的样式很像围成一圈的印第安圆锥形帐篷。她们脱衣服时，卡罗尔往上看着天花板，帐篷的竿子在天花板上汇聚成为一个点，然后才百般无聊地说：“白痴自找的麻烦。”也不知为何缘故，特芮丝就觉得非常有趣，她一直笑，笑到连卡罗尔都觉得厌烦了，威胁着说要是她再不停下来，就要灌她喝一整杯白兰地。可是特芮丝还是在笑，站在窗户旁边，手上拿着一杯白兰地。就在她等待卡罗尔从浴室出来的时候，她看到一辆车往上开到营区办公室的大帐篷那里。几分钟后，那个男人又从办公区走出来，张望着围成一圈的帐篷建筑物的四周。特芮丝被他四处寻觅的步伐所吸引，就在这一瞬间，就算没看见他的脸，没看清楚他的身躯，特芮丝还是非常肯定，他就是那个侦探。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know, but I think so," she said, and saw the anger spread slowly over Carol's face and stiffen it, and it shocked Therese to sobriety, as if she had just realized an insult, to herself or to Carol.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不确定，但我想就是。”她说。她看到怒意慢慢爬上卡罗尔的脸，凝结在她脸上，特芮丝吓得清醒了过来，仿佛她这下才明白，这是一种侮辱，对卡罗尔和特芮丝来说都是侮辱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Therese smiled, twistedly, and checked another insane impulse to laugh, because Carol would have been furious if she had laughed. Then she saw the car roll under the garage door of a tepee across the circle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese took a shower and lay down in her clothes beside Carol. Carol had turned out the light. She was smoking cigarettes in the dark, and said nothing to her until finally she touched her arm and said, "Let's go." It was three thirty when they drove out of the tourist camp. They had paid their bill in advance. There was no light anywhere, and unless the detective was watching them with his light out, no one had observed them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝洗了澡，然后穿着衣服躺在卡罗尔旁边，卡罗尔关了灯，两人在黑暗中抽着烟，一句话也没说。最后卡罗尔碰碰特芮丝的手臂说：“走吧。”已经三点半了，她们开车离开了度假营区。住宿费用已经预付过了，营区到处都是一片黑暗。除非那个侦探正躲在房间里，关了灯观察她们，否则不会有人注意她们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As dawn was breaking, a highway patrolman stopped them for speeding, and Carol had to pay a twenty-two dollar fine in a town called Central City, Nebraska. They lost thirty miles by having to follow the patrolman back to the little town, but Carol went through with it without a word, unlike herself, unlike the time she had argued and cajoled the patrolman out of an arrest for speeding, and a New Jersey speed cop at that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="破晓时分，她们因为超速被公路警察拦停，卡罗尔因此必须前去内布拉斯加一个叫做中央市的小镇支付二十元的罚款。她们跟着警察回到小镇，耽误了大概三十英里的路。但卡罗尔什么也没说，几乎变了一个人，卡罗尔以前曾经说服、哄骗公路警察不再追究她的超速，也曾经在新泽西州做过同样的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Irritating," Carol said when they got back into the car, and that was all she said, for hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真烦！”两人回到车子里时，卡罗尔终于开口说话了，这也是好几个小时以来她第一次开口说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese offered to drive, but Carol said she wanted to. And the flat Nebraska prairie spread out before them, yellow with wheat stubble, brown-splotched with bare earth and stone, deceptively warm looking in the white winter sun. Because they went a little slower now, Therese had a panicky sensation of not moving at all, as if the earth drifted under them and they stood still. She watched the road behind them for another patrol car, for the detective's car, and for the nameless, shapeless thing she felt pursuing them from Colorado Springs. She watched the land and the sky for the meaningless events that her mind insisted on attaching significance to, the buzzard that banked slowly in the sky, the direction of a tangle of weeds that bounced over a rutted field before the wind, and whether a chimney had smoke or not. Around eight o'clock, an irresistible sleepiness weighted her eyelids and clouded her head, so she felt scarcely any surprise when she saw a car behind them like the car she watched for, a two-door sedan of dark color.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝提议由她来开车，但卡罗尔说她想开。平坦的内布拉斯加大草原在她们面前展开，草原上的小麦残梗染黄了大地，而荒芜的地面和石头则呈现出褐色的斑点，在白色的冬日阳光下，看起来给人一种十分温暖的错觉。现在她们的车速慢了一点，使得特芮丝产生了一种她们根本没在移动的恐慌感，仿佛地面在她们底下漂浮着，而她们还站着不动。她看着后面的路，想要看看有没有别的警察在巡逻，也想看看那个侦探的车是否跟在后面。自从在科罗拉多泉市再度遇见他之后，她就觉得她们两人的身后，正有一种无名的、无形的东西在追逐着。她看着地面和天空，看见一些本身没有特殊意义、但被她的思绪强行附加上意义的事情：美洲鹫在空中缓慢地排列飞行，一团种子被风吹动，在满布轮痕的农田上翻飞的方向，冒烟或没有冒烟的烟囱。上午八点左右，不可抗拒的睡意压着她的眼皮，笼罩在她的头顶，以至于当她看到有辆车就在她们正后方的时候，几乎已经产生不了惊讶的感觉了。那辆车就是她一直在放眼搜寻的车，一辆黑色的双门轿车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Let's see how much distance we can make." She pressed the pedal to the floor. The road was clear and smooth as far as the headlights swept.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="整整一分钟，卡罗尔一句话也没说，只是注视着后视镜，用噘起的双唇呼气。“我很怀疑。如果真是这样的话，这个人比我想像的还要好。”她放慢了速度。“如果我让他超车，你觉得你能认出他吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol slowed almost to a stop and took the road map and laid it across the wheel and looked at it. The other car approached, and it was him inside, and went by.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol slacked her speed as they closed the distance. They drew alongside of the detective's car, and he turned to look at them, the wide straight mouth unchanging, the eyes like round gray dots, expressionless as the mouth. Carol waved her hand downward. The man's car slowed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔在两车距离贴近时放慢速度，平行着靠在侦探的车旁，他转过头来看着她们两人，那张既宽阔又平直的嘴巴没有变化，眼睛则像灰色的圆点，和嘴巴一样没有表情。卡罗尔往下挥手，那个男人的车也慢了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man got out of his car and closed his door. Some three yards of ground separated the cars, and the detective crossed half of it and stood. His dead little eyes had darkish rims around their gray irises, like a doll's blank and steady eyes. He was not young. His face looked worn by the weathers he had driven it through, and the shadow of his beard deepened the bent creases on either side of his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个侦探下了车，关上车门。两辆车之间大概距离三码，侦探往前跨越了大概一半的距离，然后站定不动。那双死气沉沉的小眼睛里，灰色的虹膜四周有暗色的边，就像娃娃空洞而固定的双眼一样。侦探有点年纪了，脸上看起来饱经风霜，胡须的阴影加深了嘴巴两边弯曲的皱纹。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was malice she had seen in his smile, even as he said he was on no side, and she could feel in him a desire that was actually personal to separate them, because he knew they were together. She had seen just now what she had only sensed before, that the whole world was ready to be their enemy, and suddenly what she and Carol had together seemed no longer love or anything happy but a monster between them, with each of them caught in a fist.</div>

The letter she had never given, and the check she had never cashed. It was more likely they would find the letter, certainly.

<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝又想到那个侦探，还有离婚、敌意等等，这些都是卡罗尔必须面对的事情。卡罗尔摸了一下她的脸颊，用力把两只手掌压入她的脸颊，让她的嘴巴像鱼一样张开着，这样特芮丝就必须笑一下。特芮丝站在梳妆台旁边看着她，看着她双手的每一个动作，看着她的两脚脱去长袜，再度踏进便鞋里面。她想，现在这一刻过后，就没有什么话可以说了。她们还需要用言语解释什么、问什么、承诺什么吗？她们甚至不必看着彼此的眼睛，也能知道对方的心意。">查看中文翻译</div>
