<div class="line_en">One important result of the brush (with the pirates) on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Always when he said, "Peter Pan has spoken," it meant that they must now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by no means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just ordinary braves. They said "How-do?" to them, and things like that; and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次他说“彼得·潘有话”，意思就是叫做他们闭嘴，他们也就心领神会，驯顺地从命了。但是，他们对其他的孩子可不这么恭敬，只把他们看成普通的勇士，只对他们说声“你好！”之类。孩子们觉得可恼的是，彼得似乎认为这是理所当然的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天来到了，他们称这一天叫“夜中之夜”，因为这一夜发生的事情及其后果特别重要。白天平静无事，像是在养精蓄锐。此刻，印第安人在上面裹着毯子站岗。孩子们在地下吃晚饭；只有彼得不在，他出去探听钟点去了。在岛上，探听钟点的方法是，找到那条鳄鱼，在一边等着，听它肚里的钟报时。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father. "Father knows best," she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="私下里，温迪有点同情那些孩子们，但她是一个非常忠实贤惠的主妇，对于抱怨父亲的话，一概不听。“父亲是对的”，她总是说，不管她个人的看法怎么样。她个人的看法是，印第安人不该管她叫老婆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying, "I complain of so-and-so;" but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这顿饭是一顿假想的茶点，他们围坐在桌边，狼吞虎咽地大嚼；他们聊天、逗嘴的声音，温迪说简直震得耳聋。当然，温迪并不怎么在乎吵闹，可是，她不能允许他们抢东西吃，还说图图撞了他们的胳臂。吃饭时，他们有一条定规：不许回击，而应该把争端向温迪报告，礼貌地举起右手说：“我控告某某人。”可是实际上，他们不是忘记这样做，就是做得太多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance gave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They sang and danced in their night- gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but himself, and he said happily:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们谁也不知道。也许不知道更好。正因为懵懵懂懂一无所知，才能再享受一小时的快乐；由于这是他们在岛上的最后一小时，让我们欢庆他们有足足六十分钟的快乐。他们穿着睡衣又唱又跳，唱着一支叫人愉快得起鸡皮疙瘩的歌，在歌中，他们假装害怕自己的影子；他们一点也不知道，阴影很快就会笼罩着他们，使他们真的陷入了恐惧。他们的舞跳得那么欢快热闹，床上床下互相打闹。那其实是一场枕头战，而不是跳舞了；打完之后，那些枕头硬要再打一阵，就像一帮知道永不会再见的伙伴一样。在温迪讲安睡的故事以前，他们讲了多少故事啊！就连斯莱特利那晚也想讲一个故事，可是一开头，就讲得那么沉闷乏味，连他自己也讲不下去了。于是他沮丧地说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I almost agree with her," Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the night was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我几乎和她有同感。”温迪怒冲冲地说。想想看，温迪居然也会怒冲冲地说话。可见她受够了，而且她也没想到这个晚上会发生什么事。要是她早知道的话，她绝不会发火的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if he had done either of those things this time they might all still be on the island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened.</div>
