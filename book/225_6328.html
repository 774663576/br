<div class="line_en">He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?</div>

<div class="line_en">It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there? How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是在迷惑惊讶之余一想，答案又很清楚。若是那印象并非产生于相应的、现实的、充分的原因，他贾维斯。罗瑞又怎么会到这儿来呢？又怎么会在曼内特医生诊室的沙发上和衣而卧睡着了呢？怎么又会一大早站在医生寝室的门口思考着这些问题呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.</div>

<div class="line_en">So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy.

It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself -- as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been," he paused and took a deep breath --"a slight relapse."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="医生痛苦地环顾了一下屋子，摇摇头，低声回答，“一点也不记得。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I believe," returned Doctor Manette, "that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would be recalled -- say, under certain circumstances -- say, on a particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信，”曼内特医生回答，“是因为导致疾病的一连串思想和回忆重新以激烈的、异常的形式出现所致。我认为是某种最痛苦的紧张联想又在记忆中活跃了起来。他心里很可能有一种长期隐藏的恐惧，他惧怕回忆起有关的问题。比如某种环境，或是某个特定的时期。他努力准备克服，却失败了；也许他准备克服的努力正好削弱了他的承受力。”">查看中文翻译</div>

We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这次侥幸度过的病患的影响之下，患者恢复了一种职业活动，”罗瑞先生清了清嗓子，说，“我们可以把它叫作——铁匠活儿，就叫铁匠活儿吧！为了举例说明，我们可以说在他生病的时候已养成了在小熔炉边工作的习惯。这回他又出人意外地在他的小熔炉边干起活儿来。若是他还把那小熔炉保留起来，会不会令人遗憾呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see," said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause, "it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings of this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看，”曼内特医生尴尬地过了一会儿才转向他说，“对这个可怜的人最深层的内心活动很难做前后一致的解释。他曾经严重地渴望那种职业活动，在它出现时他便非常欢迎。那无疑大大减轻了他的痛苦，因为它使他用手指上的忙碌代替了头脑里的煌惑，在更熟练之后又以手的灵巧代替了精神的折磨。因此一想到把那工具放到他所找不到的地方他就受不了。即使到了现在，虽然我也相信他比以前对自己有了更多的希望，甚至谈到自己也有了某种信心，但一想到他万一要从事往昔的活动而又找不到，便不禁突然感到恐怖。我们可以想象那正像一个迷了路的孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You do not find it easy to advise me?" said Mr. Lorry. "I quite understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think --" And there he shook his head, and stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你很为难，不好替我拿主意么？”罗瑞先生说。“这个问题很微妙，我明白，可我认为——”他摇摇头住了嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder -- for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible crime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他离开屋子的那天晚上，罗瑞先生拿了柴刀、锯子、钻子和锤子进了他的屋，普洛丝小姐掌着烛陪伴他。他们关上了门。罗瑞先生神秘地、惴惴不安地把皮匠的板凳劈成了几块，普洛丝小姐擎着烛火，仿佛是在协助搞一桩谋杀——实际上她那副凶狠的模样倒也并非不像那个角色。板凳立即在厨房的灶火里烧掉了（事先已劈成碎块）；工具、鞋和皮革则埋在了花园里。毁灭与秘密对诚实的心是十分邪恶的，罗瑞先生和普洛丝小姐在完成任务和消灭踪迹的时候几乎感到自己是在合谋进行一桩恐怖的谋杀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and she had no suspicions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗瑞先生立即同意了，谈话就此结束。两人在乡下过了一天，医生完全正常了。随后的三天里也一直完全正常，到了第十四天他离开伦敦跟露西和他的丈夫会合了。罗瑞先生事先向他说明了他们为解释他没有去信所采取的预防措施，他便按那种解释去了信，女儿一点也没有怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
