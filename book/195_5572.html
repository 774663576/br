<div class="line_en">About a fortnight after this Philip, going home one evening after his day's work at the hospital, knocked at the door of Cronshaw's room. He got no answer and walked in. Cronshaw was lying huddled up on one side, and Philip went up to the bed. He did not know whether Cronshaw was asleep or merely lay there in one of his uncontrollable fits of irritability. He was surprised to see that his mouth was open. He touched his shoulder. Philip gave a cry of dismay. He slipped his hand under Cronshaw's shirt and felt his heart; he did not know what to do; helplessly, because he had heard of this being done, he held a looking-glass in front of his mouth. It startled him to be alone with Cronshaw. He had his hat and coat still on, and he ran down the stairs into the street; he hailed a cab and drove to Harley Street. Dr. Tyrell was in.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip remembered what Cronshaw had said. He wondered whether at that last moment he had been seized with the terror of death.

<div class="line_en">Philip and he went out together, parting on the doorstep, and Philip went to a telegraph office in order to send a message to Leonard Upjohn. Then he went to an undertaker whose shop he passed every day on his way to the hospital. His attention had been drawn to it often by the three words in silver lettering on a black cloth, which, with two model coffins, adorned the window: Economy, Celerity, Propriety. They had always diverted him. The undertaker was a little fat Jew with curly black hair, long and greasy, in black, with a large diamond ring on a podgy finger. He received Philip with a peculiar manner formed by the mingling of his natural blatancy with the subdued air proper to his calling. He quickly saw that Philip was very helpless and promised to send round a woman at once to perform the needful offices. His suggestions for the funeral were very magnificent; and Philip felt ashamed of himself when the undertaker seemed to think his objections mean. It was horrible to haggle on such a matter, and finally Philip consented to an expensiveness which he could ill afford.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普和他一道出门，然后独自去了电报局给莱昂纳多·厄普约翰发了封信。往医院走的路上，又去了每天都会经过的一家送葬者开的殡仪用品店。这家店橱窗里摆了两口棺材，还挂着块黑布，上面有几个银色的大字：经济、便捷、得体。菲利普早就注意到这几个字了，去医院的路上时常看着它们走神。送葬者是个矮矮胖胖的犹太人，黑色鬈发蓄得很长，油腻腻的，一身黑衣，粗短的手指上套了个鸽子蛋一样的大钻石戒指。他本来天性活泼，却不得不由于职业的关系装出一副哀默沉痛的样子，接待菲利普的时候，表现得也有些不自然。他一眼就识出菲利普不知所措的窘态，答应派个妇人过去帮着打点些必要的事务。按他的几点建议，这场葬礼应该大操大办。菲利普不想让他觉得自己不同意这些建议是因为舍不得花钱，而且在这件事上讨价还价着实说不过去，所以最后他还是妥协了，同意办一场几乎负担不起的隆重葬礼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was ashamed to give her less than the larger sum. She thanked him with just so much effusiveness as was seemly in presence of the grief he might be supposed to feel, and left him. Philip went back into his sitting-room, cleared away the remains of his supper, and sat down to read Walsham's Surgery. He found it difficult. He felt singularly nervous. When there was a sound on the stairs he jumped, and his heart beat violently. That thing in the adjoining room, which had been a man and now was nothing, frightened him. The silence seemed alive, as if some mysterious movement were taking place within it; the presence of death weighed upon these rooms, unearthly and terrifying: Philip felt a sudden horror for what had once been his friend. He tried to force himself to read, but presently pushed away his book in despair. What troubled him was the absolute futility of the life which had just ended. It did not matter if Cronshaw was alive or dead. It would have been just as well if he had never lived. Philip thought of Cronshaw young; and it needed an effort of imagination to picture him slender, with a springing step, and with hair on his head, buoyant and hopeful. Philip's rule of life, to follow one's instincts with due regard to the policeman round the corner, had not acted very well there: it was because Cronshaw had done this that he had made such a lamentable failure of existence. It seemed that the instincts could not be trusted. Philip was puzzled, and he asked himself what rule of life was there, if that one was useless, and why people acted in one way rather than in another. They acted according to their emotions, but their emotions might be good or bad; it seemed just a chance whether they led to triumph or disaster. Life seemed an inextricable confusion. Men hurried hither and thither, urged by forces they knew not; and the purpose of it all escaped them; they seemed to hurry just for hurrying's sake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普抹不开脸面，只好也给了她两镑六便士。她猜想着菲利普此时应该很难过，所以压抑着心里的激动，不动声色地道了谢。菲利普回到客厅，把吃剩的晚餐收拾干净，坐下来，翻开沃尔沙姆写的《外科医学》。他觉得这本书很难懂。此刻，他的神经紧紧绷着。楼梯上稍有动静，就吓得从椅子上弹起来，心怦怦跳个不停。隔壁屋子里的那个东西让他提心吊胆，那曾经是个活生生的人，现在却什么也不是了。四周的静谧像是有生命的，无法揣测的神秘事物正在其中暗自酝酿，悄悄进行。死亡的阴影沉沉笼罩了整个房间，气氛诡异，让人汗毛倒竖。菲利普想到这具冰冷的尸骨曾经是他的朋友，顿时觉得后背一阵发冷。他竭力想定下心来阅读，最终却只能绝望地把书扔到一边。真正让他不安的是这条刚刚结束的生命在世上活过一遭，却没有留下丝毫价值。就好像不管克朗肖是生是死，都没有任何区别；就好像他从没来过这个世界。菲利普想，克朗肖年轻的时候该是什么样子。很难想象他也曾经又瘦又高，头发浓密油亮，走起路来大步生风，朝气蓬勃，好像未来有无限的希望。菲利普的人生信条——在不惊动警察的情况下，做什么事都随心而来——似乎并没起到什么好作用。克朗肖就是这么做的，可他这一生却是彻头彻尾的失败。看起来，人的本能是不可信的。菲利普又困惑了。他扪心自问，若是自己总结的信条并不准确，那么人这一生究竟是不是按规则来的呢？为什么人和人之间行事的方式都不相同呢？人的一举一动都是按着自己的情绪来，可情绪也分好赖，到底是把你引向胜利之巅还是推进灾难之渊都在一念之间。生活，是逃不脱的谜。人在天地间疲于奔命，冥冥之中，为心底的欲望所驱赶，早已忘却初心，只为忙累而忙累。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip kept his eye on the monthlies, and a few weeks later it appeared. The article made something of a stir, and extracts from it were printed in many of the papers. It was a very good article, vaguely biographical, for no one knew much of Cronshaw's early life, but delicate, tender, and picturesque. Leonard Upjohn in his intricate style drew graceful little pictures of Cronshaw in the Latin Quarter, talking, writing poetry: Cronshaw became a picturesque figure, an English Verlaine; and Leonard Upjohn's coloured phrases took on a tremulous dignity, a more pathetic grandiloquence, as he described the sordid end, the shabby little room in Soho; and, with a reticence which was wholly charming and suggested a much greater generosity than modesty allowed him to state, the efforts he made to transport the Poet to some cottage embowered with honeysuckle amid a flowering orchard. And the lack of sympathy, well-meaning but so tactless, which had taken the poet instead to the vulgar respectability of Kennington! Leonard Upjohn described Kennington with that restrained humour which a strict adherence to the vocabulary of Sir Thomas Browne necessitated. With delicate sarcasm he narrated the last weeks, the patience with which Cronshaw bore the well-meaning clumsiness of the young student who had appointed himself his nurse, and the pitifulness of that divine vagabond in those hopelessly middle-class surroundings. Beauty from ashes, he quoted from Isaiah. It was a triumph of irony for that outcast poet to die amid the trappings of vulgar respectability; it reminded Leonard Upjohn of Christ among the Pharisees, and the analogy gave him opportunity for an exquisite passage. And then he told how a friend -- his good taste did not suffer him more than to hint subtly who the friend was with such gracious fancies -- had laid a laurel wreath on the dead poet's heart; and the beautiful dead hands had seemed to rest with a voluptuous passion upon Apollo's leaves, fragrant with the fragrance of art, and more green than jade brought by swart mariners from the manifold, inexplicable China. And, an admirable contrast, the article ended with a description of the middle-class, ordinary, prosaic funeral of him who should have been buried like a prince or like a pauper. It was the crowning buffet, the final victory of Philistia over art, beauty, and immaterial things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普留心注意着那几家评论月刊，几个礼拜之后，厄普约翰的文章刊登出来了。这篇文章激起了不小轰动，很多报纸都刊登了其节选。写得确实不错，因为没人知道克朗肖早年的生活，所以传记性并不是非常明显，文字精致动人，描写生动形象。厄普约翰用他精雕细琢的语言风格把生活在拉丁区的克朗肖描绘成一个高谈阔论、笔耕不辍的形象，一个“英国魏尔伦”跃然纸上。在写到他辞世时的凄楚，和索霍区那件寒酸破烂的小屋时，厄普约翰用华丽甚至夸张的词句写出一种动人心魄的豪迈气势。他把自己写成一个隐忍镇定、魄力十足的男人，还厚着脸皮吹嘘自己慷慨大度，大费一番周折才把诗人搬到那所小房子里——别看房子破，但却繁花簇拥，诗意翩跹。可竟然有人好心办坏事，不懂得体谅诗人的心情，非要让他住在喧嚣尘俗的肯宁顿大街！莱昂纳多·厄普约翰描写肯宁顿大街的时候，笔墨里带着某种有所节制的幽默感，所用的辞藻表达都按着托马斯·布朗的风格来。他用微妙的讽刺笔调讲述了克朗肖生前最后几周的经历：热心的年轻医学生非要承担照顾他的任务，而他也只好耐着性子，忍受这种笨手笨脚的照顾；他虽无家可归，却有着神圣的人格，可惜最后身不由己，只能在这个中产阶级的环境中绝望地与世长辞。他引用了《以赛亚书》里的“美自灰烬出”。流浪的诗人死在庸俗体面的环境，堪称讽刺的胜利。莱昂纳多·厄普约翰联想起身处法利赛人包围之下的耶稣基督，这般相似的情景让他灵感大发、下笔有神，洋洋洒洒写下一大段。再往下，他提到一位朋友（他文笔精妙不凡，没有点明这位格调高雅的朋友究竟是谁，只是稍微做了暗示）把月桂花环放在已故诗人的心口；他失去生命的冰冷美丽的双手搁在阿波罗的叶子上，似是摆出一种撩人情欲的姿态。花叶幽幽，散发艺术的醇香，颜色比水手从地大物博、神秘莫测的中国带回的翡翠还要碧绿欲滴。文章以读者喜闻乐见的对比描写作为结尾——一场中产阶级的、平庸无趣、繁琐乏味的葬礼。克朗肖的葬礼若是不能媲美王公贵族的档次，就该将他像个乞丐一样草草下葬。这是最后的致命一击，是凡夫俗子将艺术、美和所有精神财富碾轧脚下的胜利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leonard Upjohn had never written anything better. It was a miracle of charm, grace, and pity. He printed all Cronshaw's best poems in the course of the article, so that when the volume appeared much of its point was gone; but he advanced his own position a good deal. He was thenceforth a critic to be reckoned with. He had seemed before a little aloof; but there was a warm humanity about this article which was infinitely attractive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱昂纳多·厄普约翰从没写过比这篇更精彩的文章。它奇迹般地将文字的魅力优雅同怜悯之情结合在一起。他在这篇文章中提前公开了克朗肖所有精妙的诗句。这样一来，日后出版的诗集也就没有多大价值了。可他却因此大大提升了自己的地位。自文章发表后，他就成为一名广受重视的评论家。过去他的语言稍嫌冷淡，可这篇文章却人情味十足，读来满口余香。">查看中文翻译</div>
