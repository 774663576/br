<div class="line_en">Hank held Dory in a clear plastic cup of water and used a large yellow caution: wet floor sandwich board sign to hide them as he snuck across the room. Sigourney Weaver's voice continued to speak to the tourists in the Open Ocean exhibit. "Now come with us as we explore the mysterious world of the Open Ocean."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dory gawked at the exhibit anxiously. "Mom and Dad," she whispered. "They're actually in there."</div>

<div class="line_en">When it was safe, Hank slithered out of the sandwich board sign and quickly camouflaged as a continent on a giant globe in the center of the room. Then he carefully inched closer to the exhibit. As they neared it, Dory started to worry about meeting her parents. "What do I say to them? I should introduce myself, probably. 'Hi! I'm Dory.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到周围都安全了，汉克立刻从人字警示牌里溜了出来，迅速伪装成大厅中央巨型地球仪上的一块陆地。然后他小心翼翼地朝着展厅慢慢挪近。快到展厅时，多莉开始担心起与父母相见时的情景。“我该怎么跟他们说呢？或许，我得先介绍一下自己。‘嗨！我是多莉。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hank jumped up to some banners and swung himself toward a blue whale skeleton. He did a double take when he saw a display that read did you know the octopus has three hearts? Hank put it out of his mind and clung to the ribs of the whale skeleton as he swung into the exhibit.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="多莉还在不停地担忧。“我的意思是，我们有太多的记忆需要填补。倒不是说我记不住事或和他们一起共度的时光…你觉得我见到他们时该说什么呢？他们要是认不出我，那该怎么办？”她紧张地问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dory continued to ramble as they landed on the Institute's upper scaffolding. Hank ducked out of view to avoid being seen by a passing staffer. Once the coast was clear, he peered over the upper platform to the Open Ocean aquarium and lowered himself toward the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多莉还在不停地絮叨，这时他们来到了研究所上方的脚手架上。汉克闪避开来，躲开了下方经过的员工的视线。等到水族馆边上没了人，他便在平台上方盯着远洋水族馆，朝着水面俯下了身子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hank grabbed on to a rope that dangled from the ceiling lights, causing a spotlight to swivel over the crowd. One man in the crowd looked up, but Hank flashed the light into eyes, and he quickly covered his face. Hank managed to stay hidden.</div>

<div class="line_en">Discouraged, she watched a stream of small fish swirl around her and swim downward. Her big eyes rested on the Open Ocean floor, where she saw something familiar hidden in the sand: a trail of shells. She gasped and swam down to take a closer look. "Shells…," she said, remembering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她沮丧地望着一列小鱼围着她游动，然后向下游了过去。她的视线落在了深海奥秘展区的地上，她看见某样熟悉的东西埋在了沙地里：一条贝壳小径。她倒抽一口气，游下去仔细看了起来。“贝壳…”她说着回忆起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">FLASH! Another memory came to her. But this time it was different. It was as clear as day -- she was actually floating right there, where the memory had occurred! As it unfolded in her mind, it seemed to happen all around her. It was as if ghosts of her younger self, Jenny, and Charlie were there with her, playing out the scene. She could see her parents placing shells down in the sand, in a long line right over there. Dory watched, mesmerized. It was like reliving the past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刹那间！另一段记忆闪入了她的脑海。可这一次却有些不一样。一切都历历在目——她正好就在此处游荡，这里就是此段记忆的发生地！记忆打开闸门，一切就好像发生在她周围似的。她小时候的自己、珍妮和查理的影像仿佛就在她眼前上演着当时的情景。她看见父母将贝壳放置在沙地里，就在那里，铺成了长长的一条。多莉望着出了神，就好像将过去的事情重新经历了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Awestruck, Dory swam behind the ghost images as they followed the shells. The trail led through the coral, winding through it until -- Dory spotted a wall of sea grass that she instantly recognized, and the ghosts quickly faded into the background. "My home," she said. "THAT'S MY HOME!" She rushed toward it with anticipation. She felt she was just a moment away from finding her parents. "MOM! DAD!" she called. "I'm home!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多莉满怀敬畏地跟着幻象顺着贝壳路往前游。这条小路一路延伸到珊瑚丛里，从中间蜿蜒穿过，一直到了——一看见那堵海草围墙，多莉马上认了出来，幻象也立刻消失了。“我的家，”她说，“那就是我的家！”她满怀希望地冲了进去，觉得自己离开父母才不过一会儿。“妈妈！爸爸！”她叫道，“我回家了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, if you ever get lost, Dory," Charlie said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，如果你迷路了的话，多莉。”查理说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sweetie!" said Jenny. "Undertow! Undertow. You have to stay away from the undertow. Right, Charlie?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“宝贝！”珍妮说，“暗流！暗流。你不可以靠近暗流。对不对，查理？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Dory looked at her childhood surroundings, every view triggered another memory. As she came upon the front yard, the ghosts appeared. She watched young Dory and her parents having fun playing hide-and-seek. When Dory looked up at her tube-coral bedroom, she could see little Dory speaking whale through a vent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多莉望着她儿时周遭的环境，每一眼都勾起她新的回忆。她一来到前院，幻象就会出现。她望着小多莉和父母在愉快地玩着捉迷藏。她一抬头望向自己的圆管星珊瑚卧室，就听见了小多莉在朝着通风口说着鲸语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Young Dory looked past the shell down a sandy slope, and a strong current rushed past, tugging and bending the sea grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小多莉朝着贝壳后方的沙地斜坡望去，只见一股强劲的水流奔涌而过，席卷之处，海草都压得弯下了腰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is very, very important, Dory," said Charlie. "We see the undertow and we say…" Her parents watched as they waited for a response, but little Dory didn't seem to understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">But once the memory ghosts faded, Dory looked around, confused and worried as a terrible thought entered her mind. Where were her parents? She swam through the opening in the grass fence, calling out their names. Then she spotted a purple shell in the sand, and another vivid memory overtook her. Dory watched as the ghosts appeared and played out the scene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可当记忆的幻象消退之后，多莉望向四周，迷惑而又忧虑，一种不祥的预感涌上了心头。她的父母在哪里？她穿过海草围墙大门，呼唤着他们的名字。就在这时，她发现了沙地里的一个紫色贝壳，又一段鲜活的记忆冒了出来。多莉望着幻象演绎着当时的情景。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the bedroom, Jenny was crying and Charlie was trying to calm her. Even though Dory was perfectly safe, for now, Jenny couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was about to happen.

"Do you think she can make it on her own, Charlie?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卧室里面，珍妮正在哭泣，而查理正努力安抚她。尽管到目前为止，多莉十分安全，可珍妮依然无法摆脱未来会有坏事发生的不安预感。他们没有意识到，小多莉当时还醒着，而且还偷听了他们的对话。“将来她会怎么样呢？”珍妮呜咽道。“你觉得她能自立吗，查理？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As she tried to pick up the shell, she heard her parents screaming her name in panicked voices. Little Dory turned to see their fearful faces a moment before the tug of the undertow pulled at her and sucked her into a cave! She screamed for them, but in an instant, the current carried her through the darkness of the cave and out to the other side. Little Dory found herself swimming in the big blue ocean, all alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dory had tears in her eyes when the memory ended and the ghosts faded away for the last time. She couldn't believe it -- she had remembered everything.
