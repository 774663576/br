<div class="line_en">'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这儿！”爱丽丝喊道，她完全忘了在刚才的混乱时刻，她已经长得很大了。她过于急促地站起来，竟弄得裙边掀动了陪审员席，把陪审员们翻倒在下面听众的头上，害得他们在人头上爬来爬去，这情景使爱丽丝想起一星期前她偶然打翻金鱼缸的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until all the jurymen are back in their proper places -- ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，国王庄重地宣称：“审讯暂停，直至全体陪审员返回原位。”他说得那么使劲儿，眼睛严厉地盯着爱丽丝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="白兔跳来蹦去，弄得她脚下的洞草沙沙作响，受惊的老鼠在邻近的洞穴间穿来穿去，不时扬起一股尘土。她还听到三月兔同它的朋友们共享着没完没了的美餐时碰击茶杯的声音，以及王后命令处决她的不幸客人的尖叫声。同时也听到猪孩子在公爵夫人腿上打喷嚏，以及盘碗的摔碎声。甚至听到鹰头狮的尖叫，壁虎写字时的沙沙声，被制裁的豚鼠的挣扎声等等。这种种声音充满了空间，还混杂着远处传来的素甲鱼那悲哀的抽泣声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers -- she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes -- and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开始，她梦见了小爱丽丝本人，又一次双手抱住了膝盖，用明亮而热切的眼光仰视着她。她听到小爱丽丝的声音，看到了她的头微微一摆，把蓬乱的头发摆顺了些，这是她常常见到的情景。当她听着、听着爱丽丝说的话时，周围的环境随着她小妹妹梦中的那些奇异动物的降临而活跃起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝走后，她姐姐仍静坐在那里，头向前支在一只手上，望着西下的夕阳，想着小爱丽丝和她梦中的奇幻经历，然后自己进人了梦乡。下面就是她的梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，她想像了这样的情景：她的这位小妹妹，以后将成为一位妇女。而她将会毕生保留着童年时的纯洁珍爱之心。她还会逗引孩童们，用许多奇异的故事，或许就是许久以前的这个梦游奇境，使得他们眼睛变得更加明亮热切。她也将共享儿童们纯洁的烦恼，因为这些烦恼就存在于她自己的童年，以及那愉快的夏日回忆之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality -- the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds -- the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep- bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy -- and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard -- while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她将身子坐正，闭着眼睛，半信半疑自己真的到了奇境世界。尽管她知道只是重温一个旧梦，而一切都仍会返回现实：蒿草只是迎风作响，池水的波纹摆动了芦苇。茶杯的碰击声实际是羊颈上的铃铛声，王后的尖叫起源于牧童的吃喝。猪孩子的喷嚏声，鹰头狮的尖叫声和各种奇声怪音，原来只是农村中繁忙季节的各种喧闹声。而远处耕牛的低吟，在梦中变成素甲鱼的哀泣。">查看中文翻译</div>
