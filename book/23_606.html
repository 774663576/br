<div class="line_en">The scene was the People's Building Center parking lot in Dayton, Texas. The SNAP mobile clinic was full of dogs and cats, 22 of them to be spayed or neutered. Dr. Johnson had arrived, and Chris and Michele were prepping a dog for surgery.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few moments later a Dayton policeman arrived. Everyone thought that the problem would quickly be solved because the dog had a collar and tag. The Chihuahua wouldn't let the officer or anyone else come near enough to read it though.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a lot of barking coming from outside. The crew looked out the window and saw a little brown five-pound Chihuahua barking at a dark blue Jeep Liberty. This dog literally would not let this car move. The driver started edging forward very slowly, but the Chihuahua got right in front of the front wheel. The little fellow kept barking and wouldn't budge. Soon a crowd gathered in the parking lot. One of the onlookers suggested the driver back up. When she tried, the Chihuahua quickly ran around to the back of the car and wouldn't let the driver go backwards either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面一片狗吠声。员工们向窗外望去，看到一只小小的5磅重的棕色吉娃娃，正冲着一辆深蓝色吉普车叫着。这只狗的本意是不想让这辆车走。司机开始慢慢地行进，但是吉娃娃正好站在前面的轮胎下。这只小狗不停地叫着，一丝也不让步。很快，停车场里聚满了人。其中一个旁观者建议司机向后退。司机准备后退的时候，吉娃娃很快奔至车的尾部，也不让车往后退。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The standoff went on for 45 minutes or so. The lady kept saying she needed to be somewhere. The SNAP team offered ideas on how to secure the pup and even supplied food to be used to bribe him away from the Jeep. The Chihuahua would have none of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对峙大概持续了45分钟。这位小姐坚持认为应该有人来处理这只小狗。SNAP出主意保护小狗，甚至用食物来诱惑它离开吉普车。但是对吉娃娃来说都不奏效。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally the parking lot group decided on a plan. The lady in the dark blue Jeep Liberty started driving ahead very slowly with the passenger door open very slowly as in one mile per hour. The Chihuahua ran along the passenger side of the car. The Dayton Police car followed, and behind him were two other cars. They led the Chihuahua in this way to a fenced area behind the People's Building Center supermarket. There they were finally able to catch the Chihuahua and read the tag on his collar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，停车场作出一个决定。深蓝色吉普车中的女士开始慢慢开动汽车，按每小时一英里的速度缓慢行驶。吉娃娃顺着车的方向跑。警车紧随其后，后面还跟着两辆其他的车。他们把吉娃娃带到人民建设中心超级市场后面一块围封起来的区域。最后抓住了吉娃娃，看清了它身上的标签。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Imagine everyone's surprise when the Chihuahua's guardian turned out to be the owner of a dark blue Jeep Liberty! They had driven to a Walgreens drug store near the People's Building Center a day or so earlier. There, unbeknownst to the guardian, the Chihuahua had jumped out of the car. The guardian had discovered the dog was missing after returning home and had returned to the drug store several times to try to find him but without success.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当查出这只吉娃娃的监护人就是一辆深蓝色吉普车的主人时，可以想象大家有多惊讶。大概一天前，主人曾带着吉娃娃驱车前往人民建设中心附近的沃尔格林药店。在那里，在监护人不知情的情况下，它跳出了车。监护人在回家之后才发现狗丢了，之后几次回药店去寻找，都没有找到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once the whole story was known, everyone realized just how smart the little Chihuahua had been. He recognized that the Jeep matched his guardian's car. (The color was off a bit, but dogs can't distinguish most colors.) He also recognized that the person in the car was the wrong person. He thus decided that the best approach was to keep the car there until the right person came along. It was his intelligence that ultimately enabled the smart little guy to find his way home. He taught us how smart a dog can be in the process.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当知道整个故事之后，大家都觉得这只小吉娃娃是多么聪明。它认出那辆吉普车和主人的车是一样的，还认出车里的人不是主人。因此决定，最后的方法就是不让车走，直到主人出现。是它的机灵才智最后帮助它找到了回家的路。在这个故事中，我们看到了，狗狗究竟有多么聪明。">查看中文翻译</div>
