<div class="line_en">January. It was all things. And it was one thing, like a solid door. Its cold sealed the city in a gray capsule. January was moments, and January was a year. January rained the moments down, and froze them in her memory: the woman she saw peering anxiously by the light of a match at the names in a dark doorway, the man who scribbled a message and handed it to his friend before they parted on the sidewalk, the man who ran a block for a bus and caught it. Every human action seemed to yield a magic. January was a two-faced month, jangling like jester's bells, crackling like snow crust, pure as any beginning, grim as an old man, mysteriously familiar yet unknown, like a word one can almost but not quite define.</div>

<div class="line_en">A young man named Red Malone and a baldheaded carpenter worked with her on the Small Rain set. Mr. Donohue was very pleased with it. He said he had asked a Mr. Baltin to come in and see her work. Mr. Baltin was a graduate of a Russian academy, and had designed a few sets for theaters in New York. Therese had never heard of him. She tried to get Mr. Donohue to arrange an appointment for her to see Myron Blanchard or Ivor Harkevy, but Mr. Donohue never promised anything. He couldn't, Therese supposed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Baltin came in one afternoon, a tall, bent man in a black hat and a seedy overcoat, and looked intently at the work she showed him. She had brought only three or four models down to the theatre, her very best ones. Mr. Baltin told her of a play that was to start in production in about six weeks. He would be glad to recommend her as an assistant, and Therese said that would work out very well, because she would be out of town until then, anyway. Everything was working out very well in these last days. Mr. Andronich had promised her a two-week job in Philadelphia in the middle of February, which would be just about the time she would be back from the trip with Carol. Therese wrote down the name and address of the man Mr. Baltin knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天下午，巴尔丁先生过来了，他是一个驼背的高个子男人，戴着黑帽子，穿着破旧的外套，专注地看着她展示给他的作品。她只拿了三四个自己最好的模型到剧院。巴尔丁先生告诉她，有一出戏大约六周后就要开始制作，他乐于推荐她担任助理，特芮丝回答说太好了，因为她那时候应该已经出城回来了。最后的几天一切都很顺利，安德罗尼奇先生答应二月中为她提供一个为期两周的工作机会，就在费城，而那个时候她也差不多刚和卡罗尔旅行回来。特芮丝写下了巴尔丁先生认识的那个人的名字和地址。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's looking for someone now, so call him the first of the week," Mr. Baltin said. "It'll just be a helper's job, but his helper, a pupil of mine, is working with Harkevy now."</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right. Thank you." Friday was a whole week off. Harkevy was not unapproachable, Therese had heard, but he had the reputation of never making appointments, much less keeping them if he did make them, because he was very busy. But maybe Mr. Baltin knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，谢谢。”礼拜五是一个礼拜的结束。特芮丝听说哈凯维不难找，但他从来不先约时间，更别说遵照约定时间会面了，因为他非常忙碌。但或许巴尔丁先生也知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Phil was standing on the other side of her now. He looked cheerful, but a little dark around the eyes. For the past week, in a sullen mood, he had been writing a play. He had read a few scenes of it aloud at his New Year's party. Phil called it an extension of Kafka's Metamorphosis. She had drawn a rough sketch for a set New Year's morning, and showed it to Phil when she came down to see him. And suddenly it occurred to her, that was what was the matter with Richard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲尔现在站在她的另一边，看起来很开心，但眼圈有点发黑。过去一个礼拜里，他闷闷不乐地埋首于写剧本，还在新年派对上念了剧本的几个段落，说这个剧本是卡夫卡《变形记》的延伸。她在元旦那天早晨画了场景的草图，然后拿给菲尔看。她突然了解理查德的问题出在哪里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His play would never be produced, Therese thought, might not even be finished, because Phil's moods were capricious.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她看着他离开，走上前面的小阶梯，看起来比之前他穿着凉鞋和破旧马球衫的样子还邋遢，但他的邋遢中自有一股玩世不恭的吸引力。特芮丝想，他就像一个男人穿着自己最喜欢的旧浴袍走过自己的屋子一样。她透过前面的窗子对他挥手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think you're being naive." Richard was looking at her stonily, resentfully, and Therese thought, it surely couldn't be only this he was so resentful about. He resented the fact that she wasn't and never could be what he wished her to be, a girl who loved him passionately and would love to go to Europe with him. A girl like herself, with her face, her ambitions, but a girl who adored him. "You're not Phil's type, you know," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得你太天真了。”理查德冷酷、愤怒地看着她，特芮丝想，这一定不是他这么生气的唯一理由。他气的是她不是、也永远不会成为他所期待的女孩子，不会成为一个热烈地爱着他，渴望和他一起同游欧洲的女孩。一个长得像她一样，有一样的脸孔、抱负，但是深深爱慕着他的女孩。“你知道菲尔不喜欢你这种类型的女孩。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right." She hated it. Two of the most boring people she had ever met, a shoe clerk and a secretary, happily married on West Twentieth Street, and she knew Richard meant to show her an ideal life in theirs, to remind her that they might live together the same way one day. She hated it, and any other night she might have protested, but the compassion for Richard was still in her, dragging after it an amorphous wake of guilt and a necessity to atone. Suddenly, she remembered a picnic they had had last summer, off the road near Tarrytown, remembered precisely Richard's reclining on the grass, working ever so slowly with his pocketknife at the cork in the wine bottle, while they talked of -- what? But she remembered that moment of contentment, that conviction that they shared something wonderfully real and rare together that day, and she wondered now where it had gone to, on what it had been based. For now even his long flat figure standing beside her seemed to oppress her with its weight. She forced down her resentment, but it only grew heavy inside her, like a thing of substance. She looked at the chunky figures of the two Italian workmen standing at the bar, and at the two girls at the end of the bar whom she had noticed before, and now that they were leaving, she saw that they were in slacks. One had hair cut like a boy's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好。”她不喜欢这个点子。这两个人是她见过最无趣的人，一个是鞋店店员，一个是秘书，两个人快乐地结了婚，住在西二十街，她也知道理查德想让她看看他们美好的生活，提醒她有一天他们也可以这样快乐地在一起。她不喜欢这个点子，换成别的时候她可能会强烈反对，但她现在对理查德满怀同情，一股无以名状的罪恶感牵引着她，她觉得有必要补偿理查德。突然之间，她回忆起他们去年夏天在塔瑞镇附近小路边的一次野餐，她清楚记得理查德躺在草地上，慢慢地用折叠小刀打开酒瓶上的软木塞，那时他们聊了些——什么呢？但她记得的是那段满足的时光，他们共享了美妙、真实而且珍贵的时刻。她现在好奇那些时光都去了哪里？那些时光是怎么来的呢？现在即使站在她旁边的是他瘦长的身躯，也似乎在用他的重量压迫着她。她抑制住自己的厌恶感，结果只是让这种感觉在心里变得更强烈，变成某种十分具体的东西。她看着站在吧台旁两个意大利工人矮胖的身躯，也看着吧台尾端那两个女孩，她先前就注意到这两个女孩了，现在她们正准备离开。她看到她们穿着便裤，其中一个的发型像男孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The three of them talked of nothing, and Therese, seeing the calm in Carol's gray eyes that only once turned to her, seeing a quite ordinary expression on Richard's face, felt a kind of disappointment. Richard had gone out of his way to meet her, but Therese thought it was even less from curiosity than because he had nothing else to do. She saw Richard looking at Carol's hands, the nails manicured in a bright red, saw him notice the ring with the clear green sapphire, and the wedding ring on the other hand. Richard could not say they were useless hands, idle hands, despite the longish nails. Carol's hands were strong, and they moved with an economy of motion. Her voice emerged from the flat murmur of other voices around them, talking of nothing at all with Richard, and once she laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三人闲聊着，特芮丝注意到卡罗尔眼中的平静，卡罗尔的眼睛只有一次望向她。她注意到理查德的表情和平时没有不同，这让她感到一阵失望。理查德特地来和卡罗尔见面，特芮丝认为与其说他是出于好奇，不如说是因为他没有其他事可做。她看到理查德看着卡罗尔的手，修剪好的指甲涂着亮红指甲油，他注意到卡罗尔镶着澄澈绿宝石的戒指，还有另一只手上的婚戒。尽管指甲略长，理查德还是判断不出来卡罗尔的这双手是劳动的手，还是无所事事的手。卡罗尔的手很强壮，而且动作很少。她的声音从周遭其他平板的低语声中冒了出来，和理查德有一搭没一搭地聊着，有一度她还笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked from the entrance of the park at Fifty-ninth Street toward the zoo, and through the zoo at a strolling pace. They walked on under the first bridge over the path, where the path bent and the real park began. The air was cold and still, a little overcast, and Therese felt a motionlessness about everything, a lifeless stillness even in their slowly moving figures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从第五十九街的公园入口走进动物园，然后用散步的速度穿过动物园。步道从第一座桥之后开始弯曲，进入了公园的范围。空气冰冷，四周静悄悄的，天空阴沉沉的，特芮丝觉得一切都静止了，即使在他们这些步调缓慢的人身上，也有一种欠缺生气的平静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shall I hunt up some peanuts?" Richard asked.</div>

She felt he didn't see her, as he sometimes hadn't seen figures in rock or cloud formations when she had tried to point them out to him. He was looking down at the table now, the thin careless line of his mouth half smiling as he straightened up and shoved his hand quickly through his hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了几分钟，卡罗尔问起有没有人想去公园散步。理查德从塞得满满的口袋里抽出一张钞票付了啤酒和咖啡钱。特芮丝想，他对卡罗尔还是很冷淡，好像有点视若无睹，就像有时她指着岩石或云朵的结构给他看时，他也是无所谓的样子。他这会儿低头看着桌子，又挺直身子，用手很快地捋捋头发，嘴唇细薄的线条好像满不在乎似的，一副要笑不笑的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

Carol stood up, smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔在步道边弯下腰，对着松鼠伸出手指。“我有东西。”她轻柔地说。她的声音吓到了松鼠，但松鼠还是往前，小心翼翼地攫住了卡罗尔的手指，牙齿咬着某样东西，然后才快速跑开。卡罗尔站起来笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>

His back was to Therese, and he leaned forward, talking animatedly to a woman, jerking his spread left hand for emphasis.

<div class="line_en">He walked west on Fifty-ninth Street in his loose, lopsided gait that jutted his right shoulder ahead of the other, hands swinging unrhythmically at his sides, and she might have known from the walk alone that he was angry. And he was out of sight in no time. The rejection from Kettering last Monday flashed across her mind. She stared at the darkness where Richard had disappeared. She did not feel guilty about tonight. It was something else. She envied him. She envied him his faith there would always be a place, a home, a job, someone else for him. She envied him that attitude. She almost resented his having it.</div>
