<div class="line_en">Counting the driver, there were four men in the car with Hagen. They put him in the back seat, in the middle of the two men who had come up behind him in the street. Sollozzo sat up front. The man on Hagen's right reached over across his body and tilted Hagen's hat over his eyes so that he could not see. "Don't even move your pinkie," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a short ride, not more than twenty minutes and when they got out of the car Hagen could not recognize the neighborhood because darkness had fallen. They led him into a basement apartment and made him sit on a straightbacked kitchen chair. Sollozzo sat across the kitchen table from him. His dark face had a peculiarly vulturine look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车开的时间并不久，还不到二十分钟；当他们下车的时候，因为夜幕早已降临，黑根根本认不出是什么地方。人家把他带到一个地下室，让他坐在餐厅用的直背椅子上。索洛佐坐在餐桌的对面，他那乌黑的脸上露出了一副像劫掠成性的秃鹫的凶相。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't want you to be afraid," he said. "I know you're not in the muscle end of the Family. I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me."</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen's hands were shaking as he put a cigarette in his mouth. One of the men brought a bottle of rye to the table and gave him a slug of it in a china coffee cup. Hagen drank the fiery liquid gratefully. It steadied his hand and took the weakness out of his legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根把一支香烟往嘴里放的时候，他的手在发抖。一个人拿来了一瓶黑麦威士忌，井给他在咖啡杯里倒了一大口酒。黑根把那烈酒痛痛快快地喝了下去。这一杯酒下肚，手也不抖了，脚也不软了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sollozzo said impatiently, "That's gonna be his first reaction. You have to talk some sense to him. The Tattaglia Family stands behind me with all their people. The other New York families will go along with anything that will stop a full-scale war between us. Our war has to hurt them and their businesses. If Sonny goes along with the deal, the other Families in the country will consider it none of their affair, even the Don's oldest friends."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索洛佐不耐烦地说：“他第一个反应肯定是那样的。你得给他讲讲道理，使他明智起来。塔塔格里亚家族及其家兵家将就是我的后盾。纽约其他几个大家族为了防止咱们之间的全面战争，都会和稀泥。因为咱双方的战争会危及他们本人和他们的生意。如果桑儿愿意顺水推舟，赞成我所提出的交易，全国各大家族，甚至老头子的老朋友，都会认为这同他们没有利害冲突。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your boss is dead," Sollozzo said. He paused, surprised at the tears that sprang to Hagen's eyes. Then he went on. "We got him outside his office, in the street. As soon as I got the word, I picked you up. You have to make the peace between me and Sonny."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的老板已经死了，”索洛佐说。他停下来注视黑根，使他感到吃惊的是，黑根一听，马上热泪盈眶。他又接着说：“我们就在他的办公楼外面，在大街上，把他结果了。我一得到报告，就把你牵来了。你务必在我和桑儿之间当个和事佬。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen said, "You haven't got a chance. Sonny will come after you with everything he's got."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根说：“你这就根本没有成功的希望。桑儿将调动他所掌握的一切力量同你对抗到底。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen didn't answer. He was surprised at his own grief. And the feeling of desolation mixed with his fear of death. Sollozzo was speaking again. "Sonny was hot for my deal. Right? You know it's the smart thing to do too. Narcotics is the coming thing. There's so much money in it that everybody can get rich just in a couple of years. The Don was an old 'Moustache Pete,' his day was over but he didn't know it. Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. I'm ready to make a new deal, I want you to talk Sonny into taking it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根默默不语。他对自己的悲痛也感到意外。一种凄凉之感和对死亡的恐惧在他心头交织。索洛佐又接着说下去：“桑儿对我这一着感到很恼火，对吗？你知道这倒也是一个妙着。麻醉剂是大有搞头的。这种买卖可以赚大钱；只消一两年，大家都可以发财。老头子是个“老朽”，他那一套过时了，但他自己还不知道。现在他已经死了，随便什么也不可能把他的魂招回来了。我准备做一笔新交易，想要你说服桑儿能够配合。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen stared down at his hands, not answering. Sollozzo went on persuasively. "The Don was slipping. In the old days I could never have gotten to him. The other Families distrust him because he made you his Consigliere and you're not even Italian, much less Sicilian. If it goes to all-out war the Corleone Family will be smashed and everybody loses, me included. I need the Family political contacts more than I need the money even. So talk to Sonny, talk to the caporegimes; you'll save a lot of bloodshed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根低头凝视自己的手，默不作声。索洛佐继续劝导：“老头子落伍了。在从前，我绝对不会碰他。可是现在其他大家族都不信任他，因为他把你提为参谋，而你连个意大利人也不是，更不是西西里人。假使来一场全面战争，考利昂家族就会被粉碎，大家也都要吃亏，我本人也包括在内。我需要考利昂家族在政界的后门，这种需要甚至要大于我对那些钱的需要。所以还是给桑儿谈谈吧，给那些兵团司令们谈谈吧。你会立功，预防一场大流血。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hagen held out his china cup for more whiskey. "I'll try," he said. "But Sonny is strong-headed. And even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca. You have to worry about Luca. I'll have to worry about Luca if I go for your deal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根把那个大瓷杯端起来，再要些威士忌。“我试试看吧，”他说，“但是，桑儿很固执，即使桑儿回心转意，他也无法让路加罢休。路加，你们可得当心点。要是我赞成你的交易，我本人都得当心路加。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sollozzo said quietly, "I'll take care of Luca. You take care of Sonny and the other two kids. Listen, you can tell them that Freddie would have gotten it today with his old man but my people had strict orders not to gun him. I didn't want any more hard feelings than necessary. You can tell them that, Freddie is alive because of me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索洛佐沉着地说：“路加，我负责。你只负责桑儿和另外两个小子。听着，你不妨告诉他们，弗烈特今天本来会同他老子一道尝尝子弹，但是我的人是得到严格命令的。我是想防止任何不必要的对立情绪，你不妨明白告诉他们，弗烈特之所以还活着，就是因为我起了作用。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But glancing up, he realized that Sollozzo knew exactly what he was thinking. The Turk was smiling. And then it struck Hagen. What had happened to Luca Brasi that Sollozzo was so unconcerned? Had Luca made a deal? He remembered that on the night Don Corleone had refused Sollozzo, Luca had been summoned into the office for a private conference with the Don. But now was not the time to worry about such details. He had to get back to the safety of the Corleone Family fortress in Long Beach. "I'll do my best," he said to Sollozzo. "I believe you're right, it's even what the Don would want us to do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但抬头一瞥，他发现索洛佐精确地猜透了他的心思。这个“土耳其人”满面微笑。黑根突然想到一个问题，大为吃惊。路加·布拉西怎么样了？为什么索洛佐对他满不在乎？敢情路加已经同他们做了交易？他想起在考利昂老头子拒绝了索洛佐的当天晚上，路加被召到办公室同老头子进行了一次私下交谈。但眼下这个紧急关头不是为这类琐事伤脑筋的时候，当务之急是立刻回到长滩镇考利昂家族堡垒的安乐窝去。“我尽量效劳，”他对索洛佐说。“我相信你的善后安排是对的，甚至老头子本人也会要我们这样去做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally Hagen's mind was working. For the first time he really believed that Sollozzo did not mean to kill him or hold him as a hostage. The sudden relief from fear that flooded his body made him flush with shame. Sollozzo watched him with a quiet understanding smile. Hagen began to think things out. If he did not agree to argue Sollozzo's case, he might be killed. But then he realized that Sollozzo expected him only to present it and present it properly, as he was bound to do as a responsible Consigliere. And now, thinking about it, he also realized that Sollozzo was right. An unlimited war between the Tattaglias and the Corleones must be avoided at all costs. The Corleones must bury their dead and forget, make a deal. And then when the time was right they could move against Sollozzo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根的思想终于活动起来，不那么呆滞了。他现在才真的相信，索洛佐不是要杀他，也不是要把他扣留下来作为人质。一阵排除了恐惧的突如其来的轻松感涌上心头，传遍全身，使他羞愧得“刷”一下红了脸。索洛佐面带微笑，心照不宣地注视着他。黑根在心里度长短，权轻重。如果他不同意为索洛佐说情，他很可能被杀掉。但另一方面他也明白，索洛佐希望于他的只是反映情况，这也是他作为责任参谋的责无旁贷的分内的任务。而如今，他也发觉索洛佐是有道理的。塔塔格里亚和考利昂这两个大家族之间的全面战争一定得不惜一切代价加以阻止。考利昂一家必须埋葬死者，忘记仇恨，并促成一项交易。然后等时机成熟后，他们仍然可以设法对付索洛佐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sollozzo nodded gravely. "Fine," he said. "I don't like bloodshed, I'm a businessman and blood costs too much money." At that moment the phone rang and one of the men sitting behind Hagen went to answer it. He listened and then said curtly, "OK, I'll tell him." He hung up the phone, went to Sollozzo's side and whispered in the Turk's ear. Hagen saw Sollozzo's face go pale, his eyes glitter with rage. He himself felt a thrill of fear. Sollozzo was looking at him speculatively and suddenly Hagen knew that he was no longer going to be set free. That something had happened that might mean his death. Sollozzo said, "The old marl is still alive. Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he's still alive." He gave a fatalistic shrug. "Bad luck," he said to Hagen. "Bad luck for me. Bad luck for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索洛佐严肃地点点头。“好，”他说，“我不喜欢血战。我是个生意入，血战花钱太多。”恰在此刻，电话铃响了，在黑根后面坐着的几个人中的一个站起来去接电话。那个人听了一会儿，然后简短地说，“好，我这就转告给他。”他挂上电话，走到索洛佐身旁，凑近这个“土耳其人”的耳朵，叽叽咕咕地小声说了些什么。黑根发现索洛佐的脸“刷”一下子变得苍白了，眼睛也闪烁着愤怒之光。黑根看到这种情况浑身毛骨悚然。索洛佐打量着他，像是要看穿他的心似的；黑根马上预感到他不可能被释放了。很可能已经发生了同他性命攸关的突然变故。索洛佐说：“老头子还活着。在他那个西西里牛皮上打了五颗子弹，而他居然还活着。”他显得有点无可奈何的样子，耸耸肩。“倒霉，”他对黑根说，“我倒霉，你也倒霉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
