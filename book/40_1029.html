<div class="line_en">They sat across from her, Jalil and his wives, at a long, dark brown table. Between them, in the center of the table, was a crystal vase of fresh marigolds and a sweating pitcher of water. The red-haired woman who had introduced herself as Niloufar's mother, Afsoon, was sitting on Jalil's right. The other two, Khadija and Nargis, were on his left. The wives each had on a flimsy black scarf, which they wore not on their heads but tied loosely around the neck like an afterthought. Mariam, who could not imagine that they would wear black for Nana, pictured one of them suggesting it, or maybe Jalil, just before she'd been summoned.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other two nodded. Mariam took in their plucked eyebrows, the thin, tolerant smiles they were giving her. There was an unpleasant hum in Mariam's head. Her throat burned. She drank some of the water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Through the wide window behind Jalil, Mariam could see a row of flowering apple trees. On the wall beside the window stood a dark wooden cabinet. In it was a clock, and a framed photograph of Jalil and three young boys holding a fish. The sun caught the sparkle in the fish's scales. Jalil and the boys were grinning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过扎里勒身后宽敞的窗户，玛丽雅姆看到外面有一排繁花满枝的苹果树。一只黑色的木柜靠着窗边的墙壁。木柜中有一个时钟和一个相框，相片中扎里勒和三个男孩扶着一条大鱼。阳光照得鱼儿的鳞片闪闪发亮。扎里勒和那几个男孩满脸笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam looked up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆抬起头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She caught a quick exchange of glances between the women over Jalil, who slouched in his chair looking unseeingly at the pitcher on the table. It was Khadija, the oldest-looking of the three, who turned her gaze to Mariam, and Mariam had the impression that this duty too had been discussed, agreed upon, before they had called for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她匆匆和扎里勒左边的两个女人交换了一下目光；扎里勒则靠着椅背，心不在焉地望着桌子上的大水罐。把眼光移向玛丽雅姆的是卡迪雅，三人中看起来最老的那个，玛丽雅姆心里清楚，这肯定也是他们在把她叫下来之前就商量好的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A khastegar. A suitor. His name is Rasheed," Khadija went on. "He is a friend of a business acquaintance of your father's. He's a Pashtun, from Kandahar originally, but he lives in Kabul, in the Deh-Mazang district, in a two-story house that he owns."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有人来向你求婚。就是想娶你。他的名字叫拉希德。”卡迪雅接着说，“他是你爸爸做生意认识的一个熟人的朋友。他是普什图人，原籍坎大哈[1]，不过现在住喀布尔[2]，他在德马赞区有一座两层楼的房子。”【注：[1]Kandahar，阿富汗东北部城市。[2]Kabul，阿富汗首都。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Afsoon was nodding. "And he does speak Farsi, like us, like you. So you won't have to learn Pashto."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿芙素音点点头。“他跟我们一样，跟你一样，也能说法尔西语。所以你不用学普什图语。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Jalil wouldn't look at her. He went on chewing the corner of his lower lip and staring at the pitcher.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但扎里勒没有看着她。他只顾咬着嘴角，凝视水罐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now he is a little older than you," Afsoon chimed in. "But he can't be more than… forty. Forty-five at the most. Wouldn't you say, Nargis?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他年纪比你大一点点啦……”阿芙素音插嘴说，“但他的年纪不可能超过……四十岁。最多四十五。你说呢，娜尔吉斯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam fixed her eyes on Jalil, her heart somersaulting in her chest. "Is this true? What she's saying, is it true?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. But I've seen nine-year-old girls given to men twenty years older than your suitor, Mariam. We all have. What are you, fifteen? That's a good, solid marrying age for a girl." There was enthusiastic nodding at this. It did not escape Mariam that no mention was made of her half sisters Saideh or Naheed, both her own age, both students in the Mehri School in Herat, both with plans to enroll in Kabul University. Fifteen, evidently, was not a good, solid marrying age for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊。不过，玛丽雅姆啊，我还见过九岁的女孩嫁给比来向你求亲那人大二十岁的男人呢。我们都见过。你多大啦？十五岁？像你这么大的女孩，是该结婚啦。”另外两个忙不迭地点头表示赞同。玛丽雅姆心想，你们怎么不提我的同父异母姐妹萨伊蝶和娜希德呢？她们也跟我一样大，但都在赫拉特的梅赫里女子学校上学，都准备去念喀布尔大学。显然，对她们来说，十五岁不是应该结婚的年龄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's a shoemaker," Khadija was saying now. "But not some kind of ordinary street-side moochi, no, no. He has his own shop, and he is one of the most sought-after shoemakers in Kabul. He makes them for diplomats, members of the presidential family -- that class of people. So you see, he will have no trouble providing for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是个鞋匠，”卡迪雅还在说个不停，“但不是那种在马路旁边摆摊的小贩，不，不是的。他有自己的店铺，也是喀布尔最忙不过来的鞋匠。找他做鞋的都是外交官，或者总统的亲属——反正就是那一类人啦。所以你知道的，他供养你完全没有问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“还有啊，”娜尔吉斯说，“他也失去过亲人。我们听说他的老婆十年前难产去世。而且又过了三年之后，他的儿子在湖里淹死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's no good," Khadija said. "He's old and so…" She searched for the right word, and Mariam knew then that what she really wanted to say was He's so close. She understood what they meant to do. You may not get another opportunity this good. And neither would they. They had been disgraced by her birth, and this was their chance to erase, once and for all, the last trace of their husband's scandalous mistake. She was being sent away because she was the walking, breathing embodiment of their shame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那可不好，”卡迪雅说，“他太老啦，而且离得……”她想找个合适的字眼，玛丽雅姆已经知道她真正想说的是“他离得太近了”。她明白他们这么做是什么意思。你要错过了，也许不会再有这么好的机会啦。他们也不会再有这么好的机会。一直以来，她们视她的出生为奇耻大辱；她们丈夫的丑闻就剩下这最后一丝痕迹了，这是她们一劳永逸地将其抹掉的机会。她们要把她送走，因为她是她们的耻辱的一个会走路、会呼吸的体现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll live with Mullah Faizullah," she said. "He'll take me in. I know he will."</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam pictured herself in Kabul, a big, strange, crowded city that, Jalil had once told her, was some six hundred and fifty kilometers to the east of Herat. Six hundred and fifty kilometers. The farthest she'd ever been from the kolba was the two-kilometer walk she'd made to Jalil's house. She pictured herself living there, in Kabul, at the other end of that unimaginable distance, living in a stranger's house where she would have to concede to his moods and his issued demands. She would have to clean after this man, Rasheed, cook for him, wash his clothes. And there would be other chores as well -- Nana had told her what husbands did to their wives. It was the thought of these intimacies in particular, which she imagined as painful acts of perversity, that filled her with dread and made her break out in a sweat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆想像自己身处喀布尔，一个陌生而拥挤的大城市，扎里勒曾经跟她说过，喀布尔在赫拉特以东六百五十公里。六百五十公里。她这辈子走过最长的路，是从泥屋步行到扎里勒家的两公里。她想像自己生活在那儿，在喀布尔，在这段难以想像的距离的另一端，生活在陌生人家里，而她必须屈从于这个陌生人的心情和他说出的要求。她将会为这个人，拉希德，打扫卫生，为他做饭，为他洗衣。也还会有其他家庭杂务——娜娜跟她说过丈夫都对妻子干些什么。在她的想像中，这些亲密关系是反常的行为，会给她带来痛苦，所以她一想到就不由心里害怕，浑身冒冷汗。">查看中文翻译</div>
