<div class="line_en">Winners do not dedicate their lives to a concept of what they imagine they should be; rather, they are themselves and as such do not use their energy putting on a performance, maintaining pretence and manipulating others. They are aware that there is a difference between being loving and acting loving, between being stupid and acting stupid, between being knowledgeable and acting knowledgeable. Winners do not need to hide behind a mask.</div>

<div class="line_en">Each human being is born as something new, something that never existed before. Each is born with the capacity to win at life. Each person has a unique way of seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and thinking. Each has his or her own unique potentials -- capabilities and limitations. Each can be a significant, thinking, aware, and creative being -- productive person, a winner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个人的出生都是崭新的，是前所未有的存在。每个人皆生而能赢。每个人都有其特立独行的方式去观察、聆听、触摸、体味及思索大千世界。每个人都具备独一无二的潜质——能力和局限。每个人都有可能成为一个举足轻重、思虑明达、洞察秋毫、富有创意的人，即胜者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The word "winner" and "loser" have many meanings. When we refer to a person as a winner, we do not mean one who makes someone else lose. To us, a winner is one who responds authentically by being credible, trustworthy, responsive, and genuine, both as an individual and as a member of a society.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“胜者”与“败者”含义颇多。当我们称一个人为胜者时，并不是指令他人一败涂地之人。对我们而言，成功的人必要为人守信、值得信赖、聪慧机敏、态度真诚，或为个人、或为社会的一员，都能以真诚回应他人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winners are not afraid to do their own thinking and to use their own knowledge. They can separate facts from opinions and don't pretend to have all the answers. They listen to others, evaluate what they say, but come to their own conclusions. Although winners can admire and respect other people, they are not totally defined, demolished, bound, or awed by them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="成功者敢于利用自己的知识，进行独立思考。他们能够区分事实与观点，而且并不佯装通晓所有问题的答案。他们倾听他人意见，品评他人言论，但能得出自己的结论。尽管他们也钦佩他人、尊敬他人，但并不为他人所局限、所影响、所束缚，也不对他人敬若神灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="成功者既不会佯装“无助”，也不会怨天尤人，为自己开脱。相反，他们对人生总是独担责任。他们不以名不副实的权威姿态管束他人。他们主宰自己的命运，并且对此一清二楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A winner's timing is right. Winners respond appropriately to the situation. Their responses are related to the message sent and preserve the significance, worth, well-being, and dignity of the people involved. Winners know that for everything there is a season and for every activity a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="成功者善于审时度势，随机应变。他们对所接受的信息作出回应，维护当事人的利益、价值、幸福和尊严。成功者深知，成一事要看好时节，行一事要把握时机。">查看中文翻译</div>
