<div class="line_en">There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then. Today was Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively irritable on the Lord's Day. I guess it was her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, and managed to suggest that Aunt Alexandra's was once an hour-glass figure. From any angle, it was formidable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有这一切是有其原因的，可是我眼下一点也不想从她那儿打听什么。今天是星期日，每逢星期日，亚历山德拉姑妈就很容易发火。我猜原因就是她那件星期日穿的紧身胸衣。她不很胖，但很壮实。她却偏挑裹得很紧的衣服。胸脯鼓出达到令人晕眩的高度，腰围绷紧，屁股向两边展开，把自己着意安排得仿佛在说：亚历山德拉姑妈从前也曾经有过细腰溜肩的好身段。不管从哪个角度看，她都使人害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Atticus answered both questions in the affirmative. "How'd you like for her to come live with us?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when relatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. It was Atticus, home from Montgomery. Jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to meet him. Jem seized his briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague dry kiss and said, "'d you bring me a book? 'd you know Aunty's here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="平时亲戚们凑到一块儿，阴郁的气氛也随之而来。下午剩下的时间就是在这种气氛中打发过去的，直到传来一辆汽车从车道上拐进来的声音，这种阴郁才消失。原来是阿迪克斯从蒙哥马利回来了。这时，杰姆早已把自己的庄重丢到了脑后，和我一起跑着去接他。杰姆抓过他的公文包和袋子，我跳进他白勺怀里，让他轻轻地随便吻一吻，接着便问：“给我买书了吗？知道姑妈来了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes sir," I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that Aunt Alexandra's appearance on the scene was not so much Atticus's doing as hers. Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose her coming to live with us was in that category.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，爸爸。”我这样说了一声，他的话我一句也不懂。不过我想，亚历山德拉姑妈到这儿来，与其说是阿迪克斯的主意，还不如说是她自己的主意。她总爱对人宣称“怎样才对家里最有好处”。我估计，她来这儿跟我们一起住，是属于这种范畴的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra seemed as if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the delicacies required to sustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); she joined and became Secretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all parties present and participating in the life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one of the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral come along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. She was never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哑历山德拉姑妈住了下来，生活恢复了正常。她就象一直和我们住在一起似的。而她给传道会举行的茶会更使她作为女主人的名声远扬（在传道会作攻击吃教会饭的教徒的冗长报告时，她不让卡尔珀尼亚准备点心来招待会里的成员）。她还参加了梅科姆的誊写俱乐部，并当上了秘书。象她这样无论什么集会和活动都参加的人，县里很难再找到第二个了！她从河船上和寄宿学校里学来一些举止，不管什么道德问题，她都予以支持。她是个天生喜欢谈论别人的人，是个不可救药的爱讲闲话的人。从前她念书的时候，课本里还找不到“缺乏自信心”这个词，因此她头脑里根本没有这一概念。她从不厌烦，只要有一点点机会她就神气十足地行使她的权力，帮人出主意、想办法，又是提醒这个，又是告诫那个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt Alexandra, consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, "Uh, uh, uh." Miss Rachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, and Mr. Nathan Radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚历山德拉姑妈在梅科姆很受欢迎。莫迪·阿特金森小姐给她烤了个。莱思”饼，里头放了那么多酒，吃得我都要醉了。斯蒂芬尼·克劳福德小姐来看了她好几次，呆得很久，不停地摇着头说：“啊，啊，啊。”隔壁的雷切尔小姐有好几个下午把她请过去喝咖啡。而内森·拉德利先生甚至特意走到前院来说，见到她很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We felt it was time you children needed -- well, it's like this, Scout," Atticus said. "Your aunt's doing me a favor as well as you all. I can't stay here all day with you, and the summer's going to be a hot one."</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford's tendency to mind other people's business was hereditary, Atticus said, "Sister, when you stop to think about it, our generation's practically the first in the Finch family not to marry its cousins. Would you say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，姑妈满有把握地向我们指出，斯蒂芬尼·克劳福德小姐爱管别人闲事的毛病是遗传的，这时阿迪克斯说：“妹妹，你仔细想想，我们家几乎到我们这一辈才开始不跟表姐妹结婚，你是不是要说芬奇家族有乱伦的气质呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather's suicide, said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a sixteen-year-old girl giggle in the choir and Aunty would say, "It just goes to show you, all the Penfield women are flighty." Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak, a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.</div>

<div class="line_en">She never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groups to the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than annoyed him: "Aunty better watch how she talks -- scratch most folks in Maycomb and they're kin to us."</div>

<div class="line_en">I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我无法理解她对遗传的偏见。我自己不知从哪儿得到了这样的印象：杰出的人都是些凭自己的头脑尽自己的能力把事办得很好的人。但亚历山德拉姑妈却隐隐约约地同意这样一种观点：一个家族在同一个地方住得越久，门第越是高贵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That makes the Ewells fine folks, then," said Jem. The tribe of which Burris Ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the Maycomb dump, and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说，尤厄尔家里的人就变成门第高贵的人了。”杰姆说。这个由伯利斯和他的兄弟们组成曲宗族一直住在梅科姆垃圾场后面的同一块地皮上，靠县里的救济金繁盛起来，已经有三代之久了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aunt Alexandra's theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an ancient town. It was twenty miles east of Finch's Landing, awkwardly inland for such an old town. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied ammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good. Business was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created county's domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，亚历山德拉姑妈的理论还是有点事实根据的。梅科姆是个古老的镇子，在芬奇庄园以东二十英里的地方。就这样一个建立很早的镇子说，离河边太远了。要不是因为那个叫辛格菲尔德的机灵人，梅科姆是会靠河边近一点的。很久很久以前，这人在两条小道的交叉处开了个客店，是当时这地方唯一的小旅馆。这人不爱国，不管是印第安人还是殖民者，他都一样接待，一样做军火生意。双方谁也不管他是属于亚拉巴马州还是属于克里克部落，只要买卖做成了就行，生意兴旺着呢。州长威廉·怀亚特—比布为了促进这个新建县的经济稳定，派出一支勘测队，去确定县的确切中心，并在那儿建立政府所在地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared the grubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In the beginning its buildings were solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide. Maycomb's proportion of professional people ran high: one went there to have his teeth pulled, his wagon fixed, his heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul saved, his mules vetted. But the ultimate wisdom of Sinkfield's maneuver is open to question. He placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public transportation in those days -- river-boat -- and it took a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to Maycomb for store-bought goods. As a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years, an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅科姆最初就是为县政府建立的，因此，不象亚拉巴马州里其他一些和它一样大的镇子那样肮脏。它一开始就修得房屋结实，法院堂皇，街道宽阔而雅致。梅科姆镇上有专业技术的人多起来了。拔牙的、修马车的、看病的、存钱酌．做礼拜的、给骡子诊病的，都得上梅科姆来。可惜的是，辛格菲尔德的谋略尽管聪明已极，仍然是有问题的。船是当时唯一的公共交通工具，而他让这个新镇子离河太远了。住在县北端的人们到梅科姆镇的商店买东西，要花上两夭工夫。结果一百年过去了，这个镇还只这么大，孤岛一样处在左一块右一块的棉花地和树林子的包围之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The surveyors, Sinkfield's guests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not Sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat in the middle of Winston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest. Instead, Maycomb grew and sprawled out from its hub, Sinkfield's Tavern, because Sinkfield reduced his guests to myopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to bring forward their maps and charts, lop off a little here, add a bit there, and adjust the center of the county to meet his requirements. He sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebags -- two apiece and one for the Governor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些勘测队员住在辛格菲尔德的客店里，他们告诉店主，他的客店在梅科姆县的地界内，并指给他看了初步选定的县政府的地址。要不是辛格菲尔德那时采取了大胆行动来保存自己的店产，梅科姆镇就会坐落在温斯顿沼泽的中心了，那是个设有任何好处的地方。结果没有那样，梅科姆从自己的中心——辛格菲尔德的小旅店——向外扩展开来。因为辛格菲尔德在一天晚上把他这两个客人灌迷糊了，让他们掏出了地图和测量图。他这儿删掉一点，那儿补上一块，按他自己的需要把县的中心位置挪动了。第二天，他打发这两个人上了路，鞍袋里既装着地图和图表，也装着五夸脱酒，每人两夸脱，另外一夸脱是给州长的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States, Reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew inward. New people so rarely settled there, the same families married the same families until the members of the community looked faintly alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery or Mobile with an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance. Things were more or less the same during my early years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管内战时这个镇没有人注意，但是经济恢复法和经济衰退促使它发展，不过是向内部发展。极少有外来人在这儿安家。老是几个旧家族互相联姻，以至这块地方的人看起来都多少有点相象了。偶尔有人从蒙哥马利或莫比尔带进一个外乡人，但只在这平静的家族同化流程中引起一点小小的浪花。在我的童年时代里，这里的情况几乎没有什么变化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way: the older citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years and years, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted attitudes, character shadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each generation and refined by time. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own Business, Every Third Merriweather Is Morbid, The Truth Is Not in the Delafields, All the Bufords Walk Like That, were simply guides to daily living: never take a check from a Delafield without a discreet call to the bank; Miss Maudie Atkinson's shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. Grace Merriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles it's nothing unusual -- her mother did the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅科姆镇确实存在着一种种姓等级制度。在我看来，它是这么一回事：多年住在一起的老一辈的和现在这辈人，谁都可以对谁断言：各种态度，各种性格差异，连各种姿势都被人们认为理所当然地一代一代传下去，而且越来越纯粹。因而下边这些名言简直成了日常生活的指导；克劳福德家族专爱管别人酌事；梅里韦瑟家族里三个人中有一个是病态的；德拉菲尔德家族不讲真话，布福德家里的人走路都那样，一定得记住先给银行通个电话才能从一个德拉菲尔德家的人手上接过一张银行支票，莫迪·阿特金森小姐老是佝偻着肩，是由于她的布福蓥血统，如果格雷斯·梅里韦瑟太太从莉迪亚·平克姆的瓶子里吸杜松子酒，这算不上一回事，因为她妈就是这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the Finch Family, or to install any pride into his children. She summoned Jem, who sat warily on the sofa beside me. She left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on which Meditations of Joshua S. St. Clair was stamped in gold.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Gentle breeding," he continued, when I had found and scratched it, "and that you should try to live up to your name --" Atticus persevered in spite of us: "She asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are. She wants to talk to you about the family and what it's meant to Maycomb County through the years, so you'll have some idea of who you are, so you might be moved to behave accordingly," he concluded at a gallop.</div>

<div class="line_en">His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it down. For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was not my father.

<div class="line_en">There was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticus's vest front.
