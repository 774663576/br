<div class="line_en">I spent an amber morning making the Rescue Remedy homeopathic for Mother. I would take fifteen drops from the base formula -- which was kept in Mother's sewing cupboard, where it would not be used or polluted -- and add them to a small bottle of distilled water. Then I would make a circle with my index finger and my thumb, and push the bottle through the circle. The strength of the homeopathic, Mother said, depended on how many passes the bottle made through my fingers, how many times it drew on my energy. Usually I stopped at fifty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad and Luke were on the mountain, in the junkyard above the upper pasture, a quarter mile from the house. They were preparing cars for the crusher, which Dad had hired for later that week. Luke was seventeen. He had a lean, muscular build and, when outdoors, an easy smile. Luke and Dad were draining gasoline from the tanks. The crusher won't take a car with the fuel tank attached, because there's a risk of explosion, so every tank had to be drained and removed. It was slow work, puncturing the tank with a hammer and stake, then waiting for the fuel to drip out so the tank could be safely removed with a cutting torch. Dad had devised a shortcut: an enormous skewer, eight feet tall, of thick iron. Dad would lift a car with the forklift, and Luke would guide him until the car's tank was suspended directly over the spike. Then Dad would drop the forks. If all went well, the car would be impaled on the spike and gasoline would gush from the tank, streaming down the spike and into the flat-bottom container Dad had welded in place to collect it.</div>

<div class="line_en">By noon, they had drained somewhere between thirty and forty cars. Luke had collected the fuel in five-gallon buckets, which he began to haul across the yard to Dad's flatbed. On one pass he stumbled, drenching his jeans in a gallon of gas. The summer sun dried the denim in a matter of minutes. He finished hauling the buckets, then went home for lunch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到中午时，他们抽干了大约三四十辆车的油箱。卢克把汽油装在五加仑容量的桶里，然后一趟一趟穿过院子提到爸爸的平板卡车上。有一趟，他绊了一跤，他的牛仔裤被一加仑汽油浸透了。夏天烈日当空，几分钟就把牛仔布晒干了。将汽油都装到卡车上后，他回到家吃午饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

I remember the clammy smell of beef-and-potato casserole, and the jingle of ice cubes tumbling into tall glasses, which sweated in the summer heat.

She said she might not make it home for dinner but there was hamburger in the freezer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Luke had forgotten all about the gasoline by the time he and Dad walked back up the mountain and readied the cutting torch, but when he jammed the torch into his hip and struck flint to steel, flames burst from the tiny spark and engulfed his leg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢克和爸爸回到山上，把割炬准备好。此时卢克已经把汽油湿透裤子的事忘了个一干二净。当他两腿夹住割炬，火石与钢相撞，小火星立刻蹿成火苗，吞没了他的腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The part we would remember, would tell and retell so many times it became family folklore, was that Luke was unable to get out of his gasoline-soaked jeans. That morning, like every morning, he had hitched up his trousers with a yard of baling twine, which is smooth and slippery, and needs a horseman's knot to stay in place. His footwear didn't help, either: bulbous steel-toed boots so tattered that for weeks he'd been duct-taping them on each morning, then cutting them off each night with his pocketknife. Luke might have severed the twine and hacked through the boots in a matter of seconds, but he went mad with panic and took off, dashing like a marked buck, spreading fire through the sagebrush and wheat grass, which were baked and brittle from the parched summer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以下这个片段我们会一直铭记，一再讲述，终使其成为我们家的传说：卢克怎么也摆脱不了被汽油浸透的牛仔裤。那天早上他和往常一样用一圈麻绳扎着裤子。麻绳很滑，需要系一个死结才不会松开。他穿的鞋子也没帮上忙：破破破烂的钢头靴子，几个星期以来，他一直是每天早上用胶带把鞋粘住，到晚上再用随身小刀割开。卢克本来几秒钟就能切断麻绳，砍开靴子，但惊慌失措中他拔腿就跑，像一头被枪瞄准的雄鹿一路奔逃，把火播撒进被炎炎夏日炙烤得又干又脆的山艾和麦草中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I ran outside and saw Luke hobbling across the grass. He screamed for Mother, then collapsed. That's when I saw that the jeans on his left leg were gone, melted away. Parts of the leg were livid, red and bloody; others were bleached and dead. Papery ropes of skin wrapped delicately around his thigh and down his calf, like wax dripping from a cheap candle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跑到外面，看见卢克一瘸一拐地穿过草地。他尖叫着找母亲，然后瘫倒在地。这时我看到他左腿上的牛仔裤不见了，烧成了灰烬。腿上有的地方又青又紫，血淋淋的；其他地方惨白，成了死肉。薄如纸片的一条条皮肤精巧地包裹着他的大腿和小腿，就像从廉价蜡烛上滴下的蜡油。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我冲回屋里，拿来几瓶新的急救药，但基本配方仍然放在台面上。我抓起瓶子跑了出去，把半瓶药倒在卢克抽搐着的嘴唇间。没有用。他的眼睛像大理石一样白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The burn was the injury, I reasoned. It made sense to treat it first. I fetched a pack of ice from the chest freezer on the patio, but when the pack touched his leg he screamed -- a back-arching, eye-popping scream that made my brain claw at my skull. I needed another way to cool the leg. I considered unloading the chest freezer and putting Luke inside it, but the freezer would work only if the lid was shut, and then he'd suffocate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我推断他被烧伤，先治疗烧伤才合理。我从露台上的冷冻柜里拿来一盒冰，但是冰盒一碰到他的腿，他就尖叫起来——弓着背，鼓着眼睛拼命尖叫，直叫得我脑仁疼。得另找办法给他的腿降温。我想把冷冻柜里的东西拿出来，让卢克进去，但是冰柜只有盖上盖子才运作，可那样卢克就无法呼吸了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was only ten, and in that moment I felt very much a child. Luke was my big brother; I thought he would know what to do, so I grabbed his shoulders and shook him, hard. "Should I make you cold or make you hot?" I shouted. He answered with a gasp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只有十岁，那一刻我强烈地觉得自己还是个孩子。卢克是我的大哥哥；我以为他会知道该怎么做，所以我抓住他的肩膀，用力摇晃他。“你是想凉快点儿还是暖和点儿？”我喊道。他用一声喘息回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I mentally searched the house. We had a large garbage can, a blue whale of a bin. It was splattered with bits of rotted food, so rank we kept it shut away in a closet. I sprinted into the house and emptied it onto the linoleum, noting the dead mouse Richard had tossed in the day before, then I carried the bin outside and sprayed it out with the garden hose. I knew I should clean it more thoroughly, maybe with dish soap, but looking at Luke, the way he was writhing on the grass, I didn't feel I had time. With the last bit of slop blasted away, I righted the bin and filled it with water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Luke was scrambling toward me to put his leg in when I heard an echo of my mother's voice. She was telling someone that the real worry with a burn isn't the damaged tissue, but infection.</div>

<div class="line_en">It didn't take long -- twenty minutes, maybe thirty -- before Luke seemed in his right mind, calm and able to prop himself up. Then Richard wandered up from the basement. The garbage can was smack in the middle of the lawn, ten feet from any shade, and the afternoon sun was strong. Full of water, the can was too heavy for us to move, and Luke refused to take out his leg, even for a minute. I fetched a straw sombrero Grandma had given us in Arizona. Luke's teeth were still chattering so I also brought a wool blanket. And there he stood, a sombrero on his head, a wool blanket around his shoulders, and his leg in a garbage can. He looked something between homeless and on vacation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，二三十分钟后，卢克似乎恢复了神智和平静，能支撑住自己了。这时理查德从地下室走了出来。下午阳光强烈，垃圾箱放在草坪正中央，离阴凉处有十英尺远。装满水的垃圾箱太重了，我们搬不动，而卢克拒绝把腿从里面拿出来，哪怕一分钟也不肯。我拿来一顶奶奶在亚利桑那州送给我们的宽边草帽。卢克的牙齿还在打战，所以我又拿来一条毛毯。卢克就待在那儿，头戴宽边草帽，肩裹羊毛毯子，一条腿伸进垃圾箱，看上去既像在度假，又像无家可归的流浪汉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He ignored me and continued crawling toward the bin. He had a cold look in his eye that said nothing mattered except the fire burning from his leg into his brain. I moved quickly. I shoved the bin, and a great wave of water heaved over the grass. Luke made a gargled noise, as if he were choking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不理我，继续朝垃圾箱爬去。他目光冰冷，好像在说除了从腿烧进他脑子里的火，其他都不重要。我快速行动，推倒垃圾箱，一大股水浪涌过草地。卢克发出咕噜咕噜的声音，像要窒息一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ran back into the kitchen and found the bags that fit the can, then held one open for Luke and told him to put his leg in. He didn't move, but he allowed me to pull the bag over the raw flesh. I righted the can and stuffed the garden hose inside. While the bin filled, I helped Luke balance on one foot and lower his burned leg, now wrapped in black plastic, into the garbage can. The afternoon air was sweltering; the water would warm quickly; I tossed in the pack of ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跑回厨房，找到匹配的垃圾袋，打开，让卢克把腿伸进去。他不动弹，任凭我把袋子套在他腿上。我把垃圾箱扶起来，将水管塞进去。箱子注满水后，我扶着卢克，让他一只脚保持平衡，把他那条现在包裹在黑塑料袋里的烧焦的腿放了进去。午后的空气闷热无比，水很快会变热，我把那盒冰块扔了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad wandered home sometime after this, I couldn't say how long, a gaunt, defeated look on his face. Quiet now, Luke was resting, or as near to resting as he could be standing up. Dad wheeled the bin into the shade because, despite the hat, Luke's hands and arms had turned red with sunburn. Dad said the best thing to do was leave the leg where it was until Mother came home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后不知过了多久，爸爸回到家，一脸憔悴和沮丧。卢克现在安稳下来，在休息，或者说正勉力站在那里尽可能地休息。爸爸把垃圾箱推到了阴凉处。尽管戴着帽子，卢克的手和胳膊都被晒红了。爸爸说最好让那条腿保持不动，等母亲回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother's car appeared on the highway around six. I met her halfway up the hill and told her what had happened. She rushed to Luke and said she needed to see the leg, so he lifted it out, dripping. The plastic bag clung to the wound. Mother didn't want to tear the fragile tissue, so she cut the bag away slowly, carefully, until the leg was visible. There was very little blood and even fewer blisters, as both require skin and Luke didn't have much. Mother's face turned a grayish yellow, but she was calm. She closed her eyes and crossed her fingers, then asked aloud whether the wound was infected. Click click click.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六点左右，母亲的车出现在高速公路上。我到半山腰接她，把发生的事告诉了她。她冲到卢克跟前，要查看那条腿，于是他把腿拿了出来，湿淋淋的，滴着水。塑料袋粘在了伤口上。母亲不想扯烂脆弱的组织，她慢慢地、小心翼翼地把袋子割掉，直到那条腿露出来。不怎么流血了，水泡也少了，因为这些都需要皮肤，而卢克腿上的皮肤所剩无几。母亲脸色蜡黄，但很是镇静。她闭上眼睛，交叉手指，大声问伤口是否感染了。啪嗒啪嗒啪嗒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I believed hospital drugs were an abomination to God, but if I'd had morphine that night, I'd have given it to Luke. The pain robbed him of breath. He lay propped up in his bed, beads of sweat falling from his forehead onto his chest, holding his breath until he turned red, then purple, as if depriving his brain of oxygen was the only way he could make it through the next minute. When the pain in his lungs overtook the pain of the burn, he would release the air in a great, gasping cry -- a cry of relief for his lungs, of agony for his leg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我相信医院里的药物为上帝所憎恶，但如果那天晚上我手头有吗啡，肯定会给卢克服用。疼痛令他喘不过气来。他躺在床上，豆大的汗珠从额头滑落至胸前，他屏住呼吸直到脸变红，继而变紫，仿佛让大脑缺氧才能撑到下一分钟。当肺部疼痛超过烧伤带来的痛苦时，他哭着大口大口地呼气——肺部解脱了，腿却痛到极点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I slept, I dreamed. I dreamed about the fire I hadn't seen. I dreamed it was me lying in that bed, my body wrapped in loose bandages, mummified. Mother knelt on the floor beside me, pressing my plastered hand the way she pressed Luke's, dabbing my forehead, praying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="睡着时，我做了一个梦。我梦见那场我未曾目睹的大火。梦中我成了那个躺在床上的人，身体像木乃伊一样裹着松松垮垮的绷带。母亲跪在我身旁的地板上，按着我打了石膏的手，就像按卢克的手一样，轻拍着我的额头，祈祷着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Luke didn't go to church that Sunday, or the Sunday after that, or the one after that. Dad told us to tell people Luke was sick. He said there'd be trouble if the Government found out about Luke's leg, that the Feds would take us kids away. That they would put Luke in a hospital, where his leg would get infected and he would die.</div>

<div class="line_en">About three weeks after the fire, Mother announced that the skin around the edges of the burn had begun to grow back, and that she had hope for even the worst patches. By then Luke was sitting up, and a week later, when the first cold spell hit, he could stand for a minute or two on crutches. Before long, he was thumping around the house, thin as a string bean, swallowing buckets of food to regain the weight he'd lost. By then, the twine was a family fable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大火之后约莫三周，母亲宣布，烧伤边缘的皮肤开始长出来了，就连最严重的地方也有希望长出新皮肤。这时卢克能坐起来了，一个星期后，当第一次寒流来袭时，他能拄着拐杖站一两分钟了。没过多久，他就在屋子里踮着脚转悠了。他瘦得像根豆芽菜，为了恢复体重，狼吞虎咽地吃了一桶又一桶食物。到那时，麻绳已成为全家人的谈资。">查看中文翻译</div>
