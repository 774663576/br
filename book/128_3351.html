<div class="line_en">They each had their own room and all. They were both around seventy years old, or even more than that. They got a bang out of things, though -- in a half-assed way, of course. I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean. I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for. I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him. That's awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for himself. For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park. You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it. That's what I mean. You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.</div>

<div class="line_en">His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all. I could see where he was sitting. He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket I just told you about. He looked over at me when I knocked. "Who's that?" he yelled. "Caulfield? Come in, boy." He was always yelling, outside class. It got on your nerves sometimes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的房门开着，可我还是轻轻敲了下门，表示礼貌。我望得见他坐的地方。他坐在一把大皮椅上，用我上面说过的那条毯子把全身裹得严严的。他听见我敲门，就抬起头来看了看。“谁？”他大声嚷道。“考尔菲德？进来吧，孩子。”除了在教室里，他总是大声嚷嚷。有时候你听了真会起鸡皮疙瘩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come. He was reading the Atlantic Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops. It was pretty depressing. I'm not too crazy about sick people, anyway. What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something. I don't much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway. Their bumpy old chests are always showing. And their legs. Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look so white and unhairy. "Hello, sir," I said. "I got your note. Thanks a lot." He'd written me this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn't coming back. "You didn't have to do all that. I'd have come over to say good-by anyway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一进去，马上有点儿后悔自己不该来。他正在看《大西洋月刊》，房间里到处是丸药和药水，鼻子里只闻到一般维克斯滴鼻药水的味道。这实在叫人泄气。我对生病的人反正没多大好感。还有更叫人泄气的，是老斯宾塞穿着件破烂不堪的旧浴衣，大概是他出生那天就裹在身上的。我最不喜欢老人穿着睡衣或者浴衣。他们那瘦骨磷晌的胸脯老是露在外面。还有他们的腿。老人的腿，常常在海滨之类的地方见到，总是那么白，没什么毛。“哈罗，先生，”我说。“我接到您的便条啦。多谢您关怀。”他曾写了张便条给我，要我在放假之前抽空到他家去道别，因为我这一走，是再也不回来了。“您真是太费心了。我反正总会来向您道别的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He started going into this nodding routine. You never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old Spencer did. You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn't know his ass from his elbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开始老毛病发作，一个劲几点起头来。你这一辈子再也没见过还有谁比他更会点头。你也没法知道他一个劲儿点头是由于他在动脑筋思考呢，还是由于他只是个挺不错的老家伙，糊涂得都不知道哪儿是自己的屁股哪儿是自己的胳膊弯儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor," old Spencer said. That knocked him out. He started chuckling like a madman. Then he finally straightened himself out and said, "Why aren't you down at the game? I thought this was the day of the big game."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的孩子，我要是觉得好些，早就去请大夫了，”老斯宾塞说。说完这话，他得意的了不得，马上象个疯子似的吃吃笑起来。最后他总算恢复了平静，说道：“你怎么不去看球？我本来以为今天有隆重的球赛呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh… well, about Life being a game and all. And how you should play it according to the rules. He was pretty nice about it. I mean he didn't hit the ceiling or anything. He just kept talking about Life being a game and all. You know."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well… they'll be pretty irritated about it," I said. "They really will. This is about the fourth school I've gone to." I shook my head. I shake my head quite a lot. "Boy!" I said. I also say "Boy!" quite a lot. Partly because I have a lousy vocabulary and partly because I act quite young for my age sometimes. I was sixteen then, and I'm seventeen now, and sometimes I act like I'm about thirteen. It's really ironical, because I'm six foot two and a half and I have gray hair. I really do. The one side of my head -- the right side -- is full of millions of gray hairs. I've had them ever since I was a kid. And yet I still act sometimes like I was only about twelve. Everybody says that, especially my father. It's partly true, too, but it isn't all true. People always think something's all true. I don't give a damn, except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age. Sometimes I act a lot older than I am -- I really do -- but people never notice it. People never notice anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，……他们听了会觉得烦恼，”我说。“他们一定会的。这已是我第四次换学校了。”我摇了摇头。我经常摇头。“嘿！”我说。我经常说“嘿！”这一方面是由于我的词汇少得可怜，另一方面也是由于我的行为举止有时很幼稚。我那时十六岁，现在十七岁，可有时候我的行为举止却象十三岁。说来确实很可笑，因为我身高六英尺二英寸半，头上还有白头发。我真有白头发。在头上的一边――右边，有千百万根白头发，从小就有。可我有时候一举一动，却象还只有十二岁。谁都这样说，尤其是我父亲。这么说有点儿对，可并不完全对。人们总是以为某些事情是完全对的。我压根几就不理这个碴儿，除非有时候人们说我，要我老成些，我才冒起火来。有时候我的一举一动要比我的年龄老得多――确是这样――可人们却视而不见。他们是什么也看不见的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Old Spencer started nodding again. He also started picking his nose. He made out like he was only pinching it, but he was really getting the old thumb right in there. I guess he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room. I didn't care, except that it's pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老斯宾塞又点起头来了。他还开始掏起鼻子来。他装作只是捏一捏鼻子，其实他早将那只大拇指伸进去了。我揣摩他大概认为这样做没有什么不对，因为当时房里只有我一个。我倒也不怎么在乎，只是眼巴巴看着一个人掏鼻子，总不兔有点恶心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Grand. There's a word I really hate. It's a phony. I could puke every time I hear it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then all of a sudden old Spencer looked like he had something very good, something sharp as a tack, to say to me. He sat up more in his chair and sort of moved around. It was a false alarm, though. All he did was lift the Atlantic Monthly off his lap and try to chuck it on the bed, next to me. He missed. It was only about two inches away, but he missed anyway. I got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed. All of a sudden then, I wanted to get the hell out of the room. I could feel a terrific lecture coming on. I didn't mind the idea so much, but I didn't feel like being lectured to and smell Vicks Nose Drops and look at old Spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time. I really didn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一霎时，老斯宾塞好象有什么十分妙、十分尖锐――尖锐得象针一样――的话要跟我说。他在椅子上微微坐直身子，稍稍转过身来。可这只是一场虚惊。他仅仅从膝上拿起那本《大西洋月刊》，想扔到我旁边的床上。他没扔到。只差那么两英寸光景，可他没扔到。我站起来从地上拾起杂志，把它搁在床上。突然间，我想离开这个混帐房间了。我感觉得出有一席可怕的训话马上要来了。我倒不怎么在乎听训话，不过我不乐意一边听训话一边闻维克斯滴鼻药水的味道，一边还得望着穿了睡裤和浴衣的老斯宾塞。我真的不乐意。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he said it three times. "But absolutely nothing. I doubt very much if you opened your textbook even once the whole term. Did you? Tell the truth, boy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“简直什么也不知道，”他重复了一遍。就是这个最叫我受不了。我都已承认了，他却还要重复说一遍。然而他又说了第三遍。“可简直什么也不知道。我十分十分怀疑，整整一个学期不知你可曾把课本翻开过哪怕一回。到底翻开过没有？老实说，孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The funny thing is, though, I was sort of thinking of something else while I shot the bull. I live in New York, and I was thinking about the lagoon in Central Park, down near Central Park South. I was wondering if it would be frozen over when I got home, and if it was, where did the ducks go. I was wondering where the ducks went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over. I wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them away to a zoo or something. Or if they just flew away.</div>

It wasn't up his alley at all. One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies. That's all. They were coming in the goddam window. For instance, they had this headmaster, Mr. Haas, that was the phoniest bastard I ever met in my life. Ten times worse than old Thurmer. On Sundays, for instance, old Haas went around shaking hands with everybody's parents when they drove up to school. He'd be charming as hell and all. Except if some boy had little old funny-looking parents. You should've seen the way he did with my roommate's parents. I mean if a boy's mother was sort of fat or corny-looking or something, and if somebody's father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes, then old Haas would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he'd go talk, for maybe a half an hour, with somebody else's parents. I can't stand that stuff. It drives me crazy. It makes me so depressed I go crazy. I hated that goddam Elkton Hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？哎呀，这事说来话长，先生。我是说问题极其复杂。”我不想跟他细谈。他听了也不会理解。这不是他在行的学问。我离开爱尔敦。希尔斯最大的原因之一，是因为我的四周围全都是伪君子。就是那么回事。到处都是他妈的伪君子。举例说，学校里的校长哈斯先生就是我生平见到的最最假仁假义的杂种。比老绥摩还要坏十倍。比如说，到了星期天，有些学生的家长开了汽车来接自己的孩子，老哈斯就跑来跑去跟他们每个人握手。还象个娼妇似的巴结人。除非见了某些模样儿有点古怪的家长。你真该看看他怎样对待跟我同房的那个学生的父母。我是说要是学生的母亲显得太胖或者粗野，或者学生的父亲凑巧是那种穿着宽肩膀衣服和粗俗的黑白两色鞋的人，那时候老哈斯就只跟他们握一下手，假惺惺地朝着他们微微一笑。然后就一径去跟别的学生的父母讲话，一谈也许就是半个小时。我受不了这类事情。它会逼得我发疯，会让我烦恼得神经错乱起来。我痛恨那个混帐中学爱尔敦。希尔斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
