<div class="line_en">Barry stopped next to her, his words faltering as he saw the abomination. Silently, they both walked toward it, unable to resist a closer look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞站在吉尔的身边，也被眼前的这个东西吓到了。两个人沉默着，不由自主地一同靠进封闭舱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a huge, high-ceilinged chamber lined with monitoring consoles, cables snaking across the floor and connecting to a whole series of standing glass tubes. There were eight of the tubes lined up in the center of the room, each of them big enough to hold a grown man. They were all empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好大一个房间，天花板很高，房间里摆满了控制台，散乱地堆方在地上的线缆连接着巨大的玻璃封闭舱。一共有八个封闭舱，排列在房间中央。每个舱的大小都能容纳一个成年男性，但是黑面都是空的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barry reached down and scooped up a handful of cable, digging into his pocket for a knife while Jill walked toward the back, gazing at the technical and medical equipment and stopped, staring, feeling her jaw drop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞弯腰将线缆捡起，并从口袋中掏出匕首。吉尔朝房间里面走去，仔细地观察着一个又一个技术以及医疗装置。这时她看到一个东西惊讶的嘴都合不上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was tall, but proportionally correct, at least through the broad, muscular torso and long legs; those parts appeared human. One of its arms had been altered into a cluster of massive, dragging claws, hanging past its knees, while the other seemed ordi-nary, if overly large. There was a thick, bloody tumor protruding from where its heart would be, and Jill realized, staring at the bulbous mass that it was the thing's heart; it was pulsing slowly, expanding and contracting in slow, rhythmic beats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个家伙的个子很高，但身材却很匀称。满是肌肉的的健壮上身与长长的腿呈现出人类的特征。一只手臂变成了巨大的钩爪，长度大概能到膝盖处。另一只手臂看上去很正常。在原本是心脏的位置，能看到一个满是鲜血的巨大肿瘤。吉尔意识到这个球状的东西就是怪物的心脏。那个东西正在慢慢地跳动，有规律地反复收缩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Against the back wall was a much larger tube, at least eight or nine feet tall, hooked up to its own computer console and the thing inside filled it, top to bottom. It was monstrous.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stopped in front of the tube, awed by the abomination. She could see lines of scar tissue snaking across its limbs, surgical scars. It had no sexual organs; they'd been cut away. She looked up at its face and saw that parts of the flesh there had also been removed; the lips were gone, and it seemed to grin broadly at her through the sliced red tissue of its face, all of its teeth exposed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔虽然对这个可怕的东西感到恐惧，但还是站在封闭舱前，盯着遍布在它四肢上的疤痕组织。那些是外科手术后所留下的伤痕。没有生殖器官，应该是被切除了。它面部的一部份肌肉被移除了，没有嘴唇，因此所有的牙齿都暴露出来，看上来像是在笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She joined him at the console, looking down at the myriad switches and buttons. There had to be a switch that would put an end to its life; it deserved that much.</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd taken his gun. He'd come to as they'd walked into the lab and reeled toward the elevator, cursing them both, cursing Umbrella for creating such a screwed up mess, cursing himself for not simply killing the S. T. A. R. S. when he could have.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那两个家伙夺走了我的枪。在他们走进研究所之后，我恢复了意识。巴瑞和吉尔，我诅咒你们！你们这帮无知的家伙就等着吃屎吧！有机会我一定会将S.T。A.R。S的人全部干掉！不！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker reached the door to the room and leaned against it, struggling to catch his breath. Blood dribbled out of his ears and he shook his head, trying to clear it of the strange fog that had settled into his brain.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Ma2s, he had to be careful. Wesker opened the door and pitched forward, the ground seeming too far away and then too close. The machines were hissing at him, whining and hissing in the hot, oily air. His hand found the railing and he pulled himself toward the back of the room, trying to hurry but finding that his legs weren't interested.</div>

<div class="line_en">He reached the door and had just managed to get it open when something heavy landed on his back, knocking him into the next room. He fell on the cold metal floor and a terrible shriek sounded in his ear. Thick talons punctured the skin on his back and Wesker slapped at it, at the grinning, screaming thing that was trying to kill him. He hit the creature as hard as he could, shoving the heel of his hand into its throat. It leaped away, landing on the mesh wall and clambering back up to the ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯克终于到达了门前，正当他准备打开房门时，一个东西扑在他的背上。他一个跟头栽在冷冷的钢铁地面上，耳边听到了尖厉的嚎叫声。接着一对粗壮的爪子划过他背后的皮肤。威斯克循着声音的方向，反手将那个发出尖叫的东西抓住，一把从背后扯了下来。那个东西随即高高跃起，回到了网状的天花板上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wesker pulled himself up and stumbled on, fresh waves of pain and nausea washing over him.

<div class="line_en">He flung the door open and made his way toward the small, glowing screen in the back corner. It was quieter here, cooler. The massive machines that filled the chamber hummed softly at him, their purpose quite different than that of the ones outside. These were the machines that wanted to help him regain his control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将门打开后，威斯克走向放在墙角的一个小显示屏。这里安静且凉爽。占据这个房间巨大机器发出了安静的运作声，与之前房间里的情况完全是天壤之别。“这个机器将帮助我夺回控制权。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He found the keys he needed, the code spilling out across the monitor in soft green after only a few mistakes. A sexy, quiet voice informed him that the countdown would begin in thirty seconds. Dizzy, he tried to remember the setting for the timer.
