<div class="line_en">Napoleon Bonaparte would be defeated, people said, almost without a struggle. Weren't the armies of Europe and the great Duke of Wellington lined up against him? Everyone had such perfect confidence in the result of the battle that the atmosphere in Brussels was one of pleasure and enjoyment. The city was full of fashionable English people, riding in the park, going to the opera, dancing and gambling the nights away.</div>

<div class="line_en">In June there was a grand ball, to which George and Amelia, Dobbin, and the Crawleys were all invited. After generously buying his wife a new dress and some ornaments, George took her to the ball, where she did not know anyone, put her on a chair and left her there. She was free to amuse herself as she liked, but no one came to disturb her except Dobbin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Amelia's appearance at the ball was a failure; Mrs Crawley's appearance, however, was a brilliant success. She arrived very late. Her eyes sparkled with life, her dress was perfection. At once there was a crowd of admirers around her, begging for a dance.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last George came back -- for Rebecca's shawl and flowers. He took them away, but when he gave them back to their owner, there was a note, rolled up like a tiny snake among the flowers. Rebecca put out her hand to take them, and it was clear from her eyes that she knew what she would find there. She had been used to such notes from her early years. She gave him her hand and one of her quick, knowing glances, and George bowed over her hand, his heart hammering with the excitement of victory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，乔治终于回来了——来拿丽贝卡的披肩和花。他把它们取走，但当他将其交还原主时，里面多了一张字条，像小蛇似的卷起来藏在花束中。丽贝卡伸手接过，眼神里明白无误地表露出，她知道那里面是什么。多年以前她就已经习惯了这样的字条。她向他伸出一只手，迅速递了个心领神会的眼色，乔治躬身吻她的手，一颗心因为行动成功而激动地怦怦狂跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
