<div class="line_en">Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature this abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.</div>

<div class="line_en">Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don't know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个人一生中都曾遇到过一些奇特的事，可是在一段时间内，却毫无觉察。举个例子说吧，我们突然发现聋了一只耳朵，不知道聋了多久，就说半个钟头吧。那天晚上，彼得遇到的就是这种情况。上次我们说到，他正悄悄地穿越海岛，一个手指头按着嘴唇，一手握刀做好准备。他看见鳄鱼从他身边爬过，没觉得有什么异样；可是过了一会儿，他想起来了，鳄鱼没有发出嘀哒声。起初，他觉得这事有点蹊跷；不过，很快他就明白过来，是那只钟的发条走完了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="正相反，他自以为是像只老鼠似的悄无声息地爬上了船边。等到他看见海盗们纷纷躲开他，胡克藏在他们中间，失魂落魄，像看到鳄鱼一样，他不由得也惊讶起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: "Hook or me this time." He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得平安无事地到达了海岸。他的腿触到了水，就像丝毫不感到那是另一种物质。许多动物从陆上到水里都是这样的，可是在人类当中，我却没见过另一个人像他这样。他游泳的时候，心里只有一个念头：“这回定要和胡克拼个你死我活。”他已经滴答了很久，现在继续滴答下去已经不知不觉了。要是他觉出了，他早就停止了滴答；因为，靠发出滴答声登上海盗船，固然是一条绝妙的计策，他却没有想到过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking. At first the thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he looked behind him swiftly. They he realised that he was doing it himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. "How clever of me!" he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鳄鱼！彼得刚想起鳄鱼，就听到了滴答声。起初，他以为声音是鳄鱼发出的，他很快地回头扫一眼。这才发见，发出滴答声的原来是他自己；眨眼间，他明白了当时的情势。“我多聪明呀！”他立刻想。于是，他向孩子们作手势，示意他们不要拍手欢呼。">查看中文翻译</div>

Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the ill-fated pirate's mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward. Four boys caught him to prevent the thud.

<div class="line_en">"Down, boys, and at them!" Peter's voice rang out; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting -- five -- six -- seven -- eight -- nine -- ten -- eleven.</div>

They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler (shield), when another, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe's defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook's hand, and he was at Peter's mercy.</div>
