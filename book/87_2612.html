<div class="line_en">She emerged from the copse of trees, Joseph next to her. Barry was already at the downed 'copter, Chris and Wesker right behind. Smoke was still rising from the silent wreck, but it was thinning. If there had been a fire, it had died out.</div>

<div class="line_en">They moved quickly through the wooded area, visibility dropping off sharply beneath the needled branches. The warm scents of pine and earth were overshadowed by the burning smell, the acrid odor growing stronger with each step. From the dim light filtering toward them, Jill saw that there was another clearing ahead, high with brittle grasses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小队的成员快速穿过杂木林，可是在针叶树下视线范围变得更加有限。由于火灾，松树与大地都被覆盖了一层燥热的空气，每前进一步，强烈的有机物燃烧气味也随之变得更加刺鼻。吉尔注意到，笼罩在前方模糊的光线中是生长着茂密野草的田野。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They spread out and started north, Wesker and Chris behind and to Barry's left, Jill and Joseph on his right. Directly in front of them was a sparse stand of trees, and as the Alpha's 'copter blade revved down, Jill could smell burning fuel and see wisps of smoke curling through the foliage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Alpha小队呈扇形散开，开始向北边前进。威斯克与克里斯在巴瑞的左后方，吉尔和约瑟夫则在右后方。一行人在傍晚的森林中穿行。由于Alpha小队直升机的螺旋桨再次快速转动，所以吉尔闻到了燃料的气味，透过树叶的缝隙能够看到一道歪歪斜斜的烟柱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wesker handed the light to Joseph and nodded toward the cockpit. "Check it out. The rest of you, spread out, look for clues-tracks, shell casings, signs of struggle-you find anything, let me know. And stay alert."</div>

<div class="line_en">She and Joseph reached the others and stopped, staring, no one speaking as they surveyed the scene. The long, wide body of the 'copter was intact, not a single scratch visible. The port landing rail looked bent, but besides that and the dying haze of smoke from the rotor, there seemed to be nothing wrong with it. The hatches stood open, the beam from Wesker's penlight showing them an undamaged cabin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔和约瑟夫来到队友旁边，紧紧盯着飞机的残骸。在勘察现场的这段时间里，没有人说话。直升机粗壮的机体保住了其原型，从表面上看不到任何受损伤的地方。左侧着陆支架虽然看上去有些弯曲，除了这一点与从回旋翼中隐隐冒出的烟雾中之外，好像没有其他异常之处。舱门已经被人打开，在威斯克手电的照明下，可以看出机舱中也没有受到任何损伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Enrico had said something about a malfunction; so okay, the Bravos had set down. What had happened next? What would have made them abandon their best chance of being found, leaving behind emergency kits, weaponry -- Jill saw a couple of bullet-proof vests crumpled next to the hatch and shook her head, adding it to the growing list of seemingly irrational actions.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dry weeds crackled underfoot as they widened their circle, the only sound in the still, warm air except for the distant hum of the Alpha helicopter engine. Jill used her boots to search through the thick ground cover, brushing the tall grasses aside with each step. In another few moments, it'd be too dark to see anything; they needed to break out the flashlights, Bravo had left theirs behind…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着圆形队列的不断扩散，脚下的干草发出沙沙声。如果不算Alpha小队的直升机从远处传来的嗡嗡声，在温热的空气中惟一能听到的就是队员们踩下杂草所发出的声音。吉尔利用皮靴在高高的草丛中搜索着，每走出一步都要把等身高的杂草踩向两旁分开。不一会儿，天色完全暗了下来，周围的东西什么都看不清了。这时必须要有手电才行，可是Bravo小队却将装备留在了飞机上…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill turned and started jogging back, saw Chris and Barry do the same. Wesker was still by the helicopter and had drawn his weapon at Joseph's cry, pointing it up as he broke into a run.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="约瑟夫在喊叫，可是那声音听上去像是在漱口。面对野生的袭击者，他的双手在拼命地挣扎，从身上的伤口中冒出了大量的鲜血。他的叫声只不过是一个濒死者的疾呼而已，这可不是磨蹭的时候，克里斯瞄准目标开始射击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three rounds smacked wetly into one of the dogs, a fourth shot going high. There was a single, high-pitched yelp and the beast went down, its sides heaving.

<div class="line_en">Joseph's body was all but hidden by the three animals that tore at him, ripping at him with gnashing, dripping jaws. They were the size and shape of dogs, as big as German shepherds maybe, except that they seemed to have no fur, no skin. Wet, red sinew and muscle flashed beneath Wesker's wavering light, the dog-creatures shrieking and snapping in a frenzy of bloodlust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约瑟夫的身体已经被三只猛兽所遮挡住，所以看不到。但是他们尖锐的牙齿互相碰撞，发出令人心惊胆寒的声音，而且从强有力的上下颚之间流出了令人作呕的粘液。这些野兽大概像狗那样大小，和牧羊犬差不多。但是这帮家伙却是通体无毛，不仅如此，甚至没有皮肤。湿漉漉的赤红色肌肉与脉络在威斯克晃动的手电光下散发出光泽。类似狗的怪物一边发出好像疯狗一样的嚎叫，一边啃噬着猎物。">查看中文翻译</div>

Lungs aching for air, Wesker imagined that he could smell the fetid, rotting-meat stench of the beasts as they narrowed the distance and he somehow found the capacity to run faster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在死亡猎犬的追赶下，一行人在凹凸不平的道路上深一脚、浅一脚地跑着，肺部发出了渴求空气的悲鸣。威斯克那如同野兽一般的鼻子闻到了一股可怕的腐臭味。难道那些怪物已经扑过来了吗，于是众人丝毫不敢放松，继续向前飞奔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We should be there by now, gotta be dose -- Chris saw it first through the thinning shadows of trees, the looming monstrosity back-lit by an early moon. "There! Run for that house!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马上就要到了，应该就在这附近…是克里斯最先发现的，那幢别墅就建在那片树林的对面，此刻正沐浴在月光之下，如同一只巨大的怪物。“在那里！朝着那间别墅前进！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A gurgling yelp and the creature fell away, the howls of its siblings louder than ever, raised to a fever pitch by the thrill of the chase.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只听见背后传来了痛苦的嘶吼声，于是一只怪物退出了追赶行动，可是他的伙伴们却发出更加兴奋而又狂热的嚎叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It looked abandoned from the outside, the weath-ered wood and stone of the giant mansion crumbling and dark. The full size of the structure was cloaked by the shadowy, overgrown hedges that surrounded it, isolating it from the forest. A massive outset front porch presented double doors, their only option for escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从表面上看，那幢别墅像是被闲置了好久，巨大的建筑在风霜的洗礼下早已老化。整个建筑的四周都有栅栏，看上去好像是从森林中单独分隔了出来。庄严肃穆的正面是一扇双开门的门廊，那是摆脱“追兵”的惟一选择。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wesker actually heard the snap of powerful jaws behind him and fired at the sound, intuitively squeez-ing the trigger as he ran for the front of the mansion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，威斯克已经听到了怪物那强力的上下颚碰撞所发出的撞击声，仿佛就在自己的身后。于是他一边朝别墅跑，一边冲着那声音本能地开枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd made it. Outside, the dogs howled and scrabbled uselessly at the heavy doors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样就安全了，无论外面的狗怎么叫，这道门就是众人的护身符。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill reached the doors first, slamming into the heavy wood with one shoulder as she snatched at the handles. Amazingly, they crashed open; brightness spilled out across the stone steps to the porch, lighting their path. She turned and started firing, providing cover as the three gasping men ran for the opening in the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔是最先到达大门的人，她急忙用肩膀顶住用厚重木材所至成的大门，意外的事，伴随着一声巨响，大门竟然缓缓地打开。吉尔回过身站在门口开始射击，为身后那三个正在上气不接下气奔跑着的男人做掩护。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They piled into the mansion, Jill diving in last and Barry throwing his considerable bulk against the door, wedging it closed against the snarls of the creatures. He collapsed against it, face red and sweating, as Chris found the entry's steel deadbolt and slid it home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人终于冲进别墅，吉尔是最后一个进来的，巴瑞用他那强壮的身体将门顶住，把怪物的嚎叫声关在了门外。大家此刻面红耳赤、汗流浃背，都精疲力竭地坐在地板上喘着粗气。克里斯发现在门上有一个钢铁制成的门闩，于是将那个东西横过来把门锁好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wesker took a deep breath of the cool, quiet air that filled the well-lit room and exhaled sharply. As he'd already known, the Spencer house wasn't abandoned.</div>
