<div class="line_en">Philip did not surrender himself willingly to the passion that consumed him. He knew that all things human are transitory and therefore that it must cease one day or another. He looked forward to that day with eager longing. Love was like a parasite in his heart, nourishing a hateful existence on his life's blood; it absorbed his existence so intensely that he could take pleasure in nothing else. He had been used to delight in the grace of St. James' Park, and often he sat and looked at the branches of a tree silhouetted against the sky, it was like a Japanese print; and he found a continual magic in the beautiful Thames with its barges and its wharfs; the changing sky of London had filled his soul with pleasant fancies. But now beauty meant nothing to him. He was bored and restless when he was not with Mildred. Sometimes he thought he would console his sorrow by looking at pictures, but he walked through the National Gallery like a sight-seer; and no picture called up in him a thrill of emotion. He wondered if he could ever care again for all the things he had loved. He had been devoted to reading, but now books were meaningless; and he spent his spare hours in the smoking-room of the hospital club, turning over innumerable periodicals. This love was a torment, and he resented bitterly the subjugation in which it held him; he was a prisoner and he longed for freedom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip, burrowing as was his habit into the state of his feelings, discussing with himself continually his condition, came to the conclusion that he could only cure himself of his degrading passion by making Mildred his mistress. It was sexual hunger that he suffered from, and if he could satisfy this he might free himself from the intolerable chains that bound him. He knew that Mildred did not care for him at all in that way. When he kissed her passionately she withdrew herself from him with instinctive distaste. She had no sensuality. Sometimes he had tried to make her jealous by talking of adventures in Paris, but they did not interest her; once or twice he had sat at other tables in the tea-shop and affected to flirt with the waitress who attended them, but she was entirely indifferent. He could see that it was no pretence on her part.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="习惯挖掘自己内心情感的菲利普已经在心里反复琢磨了很久，认为只有让米尔德里德做自己的情妇才能摆脱这种苟且龌龊的冲动。他想和米尔德里德上床，这种欲望犹如百爪挠心，或许一旦性欲得到了满足，束缚着他的枷锁也会随之消失吧。他知道米尔德里德对他完全没有“性趣”。每次像疯了一样地吻她时，她总是不自觉地往后退，一脸厌恶地想要躲开。她对性非常冷淡。有时为了让她吃醋，菲利普故意讲起自己在巴黎的风流韵事，可她全当耳边风；有时菲利普到了店里，故意坐在别人负责的桌旁，明目张胆地和其他女侍者调情，可她全视而不见。她是真的无所谓，绝不是装出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes he awoke in the morning and felt nothing; his soul leaped, for he thought he was free; he loved no longer; but in a little while, as he grew wide awake, the pain settled in his heart, and he knew that he was not cured yet. Though he yearned for Mildred so madly he despised her. He thought to himself that there could be no greater torture in the world than at the same time to love and to contemn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时早上醒来，心里空荡荡的什么感觉也没有。灵魂不禁欢呼雀跃，庆祝终于得救——看来，爱情已经从身上悄悄溜走了。然而，没过一会儿，随着他醒得越来越透，心里的痛苦也渐渐复苏。他知道自己的伤还没完全好。尽管他内心疯狂地渴望米尔德里德，但同时又很瞧不起她。他心想，恐怕这世上再没有哪种折磨比爱一个人又看不起她更让人难以忍受了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the more he thought of it the more he was convinced that complete surrender on her part was his only way to freedom. He was like a knight of old, metamorphosed by magic spells, who sought the potions which should restore him to his fair and proper form. Philip had only one hope. Mildred greatly desired to go to Paris. To her, as to most English people, it was the centre of gaiety and fashion: she had heard of the Magasin du Louvre, where you could get the very latest thing for about half the price you had to pay in London; a friend of hers had passed her honeymoon in Paris and had spent all day at the Louvre; and she and her husband, my dear, they never went to bed till six in the morning all the time they were there; the Moulin Rouge and I don't know what all. Philip did not care that if she yielded to his desires it would only be the unwilling price she paid for the gratification of her wish. He did not care upon what terms he satisfied his passion. He had even had a mad, melodramatic idea to drug her. He had plied her with liquor in the hope of exciting her, but she had no taste for wine; and though she liked him to order champagne because it looked well, she never drank more than half a glass. She liked to leave untouched a large glass filled to the brim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想得越多，就越确信只有让她心甘情愿地屈服，自己才能真正重获自由。他就像个被下了咒语，变了人形的老骑士，苦苦寻找着能帮自己解除咒语的灵丹妙药。他还剩下最后一线希望。米尔德里德特别想去次巴黎。对于她，或对于大部分英国人来说，巴黎是欢乐之海、时尚之都。她听人说过卢浮宫商场，在那里能买到比伦敦便宜一半的时髦货。她有个朋友去巴黎度蜜月了，在卢浮宫商场里从早逛到晚。她和她老公在巴黎那段日子，老天啊，不到凌晨六点从不上床睡觉。他们去了红磨坊和好多说不上来的地方彻夜狂欢。如果带她去次巴黎就能让她委身于自己，那菲利普也不在乎这样的手段是否高尚了。能和她上床，花多少钱都无所谓。他之前甚至有个丧心病狂的想法，打算把她灌醉。每次都不停劝酒，想让她兴奋一些。可她一点也不喜欢喝葡萄酒，倒是挺乐意让菲利普买瓶香槟摆摆阔。她喝酒从来没有超过半杯，却喜欢把酒杯斟得快要溢出来，搁在桌上一动不动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had thought of marriage more than once, but it was a step from which he shrank. In Paris he had come by the opinion that marriage was a ridiculous institution of the philistines. He knew also that a permanent tie would ruin him. He had middle-class instincts, and it seemed a dreadful thing to him to marry a waitress. A common wife would prevent him from getting a decent practice. Besides, he had only just enough money to last him till he was qualified; he could not keep a wife even if they arranged not to have children. He thought of Cronshaw bound to a vulgar slattern, and he shuddered with dismay. He foresaw what Mildred, with her genteel ideas and her mean mind, would become: it was impossible for him to marry her. But he decided only with his reason; he felt that he must have her whatever happened; and if he could not get her without marrying her he would do that; the future could look after itself. It might end in disaster; he did not care. When he got hold of an idea it obsessed him, he could think of nothing else, and he had a more than common power to persuade himself of the reasonableness of what he wished to do. He found himself overthrowing all the sensible arguments which had occurred to him against marriage. Each day he found that he was more passionately devoted to her; and his unsatisfied love became angry and resentful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普不止一次想过结婚，但他心里一直抗拒。还在巴黎时他就有了一个想法：婚姻只是市侩小民特有的滑稽行为。一辈子都绑在一个人身上会毁了他的。他骨子里还是个中产阶级，和一个餐馆女侍者结婚简直能让人笑掉大牙。娶个平庸的妻子会阻了他的仕途。再说，他的钱只够自己撑到毕业，即便婚后不要孩子也绝对养活不了妻子。想到克朗肖就是被一个粗俗的荡妇拖了后腿，他就倍感毛骨悚然。米尔德里德总是想过上层人的生活，但无奈头脑平庸、为人刻薄，简直能预见到她将来会变成个什么样子，他绝对不会娶她。然而，尽管理智上很坚决，可情感上却仍然觉得为了得到她，做什么都不足惜。如果不和她结婚就无法拥有她，那么就干脆结婚好了。未来会发生什么，就交给未来吧。也许这场婚姻会悲剧收尾，可他不在乎。但凡有个主意冒出来，就能把他的脑子占得满满当当的，赶也赶不走。他比一般人更能给自己的欲望找理由。虽然有无数理智而客观的原因表明自己不能和米尔德里德结婚，但他现在正在一一推翻。每一天他都更爱她一点儿，而这种得不到满足的爱情让他怒火中烧，愤愤不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
