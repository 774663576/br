<div class="line_en">She would be waiting on Dragonstone as well, waiting in all her beauty and all her power, with her god and her shadows and his king. The red priestess had always seemed loyal to Stannis, until now. She has broken him, as a man breaks a horse. She would ride him to power if she could, and for that she gave my sons to the fire. I will cut the living heart from her breast and see how it burns. He touched the hilt of the fine long Lysene dirk that the captain had given him.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he came up on deck, the long point of Driftmark was dwindling behind them while Dragonstone rose from the sea ahead.

<div class="line_en">The captain had been very kind to him. His name was Khorane Sathmantes, a Lyseni like Salladhor Saan, whose ship this was. He had the pale blue eyes you often saw on Lys, set in a bony weatherworn face, but he had spent many years trading in the Seven Kingdoms. When he learned that the man he had plucked from the sea was the celebrated onion knight, he gave him the use of his own cabin and his own clothes, and a pair of new boots that almost fit. He insisted that Davos share his provisions as well, though that turned out badly. His stomach could not tolerate the snails and lampreys and other rich food Captain Khorane so relished, and after his first meal at the captain's table he spent the rest of the day with one end or the other dangling over the rail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船长待他很好。他名叫柯连恩？萨斯芒，跟这艘船的主人萨拉多？桑恩一样，来自于里斯，里斯人常见的淡蓝眼睛长在他饱经风霜的瘦脸上。此人在七大王国间进行贸易已有许多年。当他得知从海里捞起来的就是著名的洋葱骑士，立即把自己的舱室和衣服让给戴佛斯，还为他找来一双大小差不多合适的新靴子，并坚持要前走私者享用他的美味——只是效果不妙。戴佛斯的胃受不了蜗牛、鳗鱼及柯连恩船长钟爱的其他海产，用餐之后，一整天他都上吐下泻，摇摇晃晃地趴在栏杆上度过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dragonstone loomed larger with every stroke of the oars. Davos could see the shape of the mountain now, and on its side the great black citadel with its gargoyles and dragon towers. The bronze figurehead at the bow of Shayala's Dance sent up wings of salt spray as it cut the waves. He leaned his weight against the rail, grateful for its support. His ordeal had weakened him. If he stood too long his legs shook, and sometimes he fell prey to uncontrollable fits of coughing and brought up gobs of bloody phlegm. It is nothing, he told himself. Surely the gods did not bring me safe through flre and sea only to kill me with a flux.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that was another lifetime, he thought. That was before the onion ship, before Storm's End, before Stannis shortened my fingers. That was before the war or the red comet, before I was a Seaworth or a knight. I was a different man in those days, before Lord Stannis raised me high.</div>

<div class="line_en">Captain Khorane had told him of the end of Stannis's hopes, on the night the river burned. The Lannisters had taken him from the flank, and his fickle bannermen had abandoned him by the hundreds in the hour of his greatest need. "King Renly's shade was seen as well," the captain said, "slaying right and left as he led the lion lord's van. It's said his green armor took a ghostly glow from the wildfire, and his antlers ran with golden flames."</div>

<div class="line_en">The mountain grew taller, crowned all in pale smoke. The sail sang, the drum beat, the oars pulled smoothly, and before very long the mouth of the harbor opened before them. So empty, Davos thought, remembering how it had been before, with the ships crowding every quay and rocking at anchor off the breakwater. He could see Salladhor Saan's flagship Valyrian moored at the quay where Fury and her sisters had once tied up. The ships on either side of her had striped Lysene hulls as well. In vain he looked for any sign of Lady Marya or Wraith.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山越来越高，围绕着苍白的烟雾。船帆在歌唱，鼓点继续敲打，木桨则平滑划动，过了一阵，港口出现在面前。好空旷啊，戴佛斯心想，记得出发以前，每个码头都挤满了船，停泊在防波堤边摇曳。如今最好的泊位由萨拉多？桑恩的旗舰瓦雷利亚人号占据——那儿原先是怒火号与她的姐妹舰的地盘。该船周围也都是船身彩绘的里斯舰艇。他徒劳地寻找着玛瑞亚夫人号和海灵号的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Salladhor Saan was not aboard his Valyrian. They found him at another quay a quarter mile distant, down in the hold of a big-bellied Pentoshi cog named Bountiful Harvest, counting cargo with two eunuchs. One held a lantern, the other a wax tablet and stylus. "Thirty-seven, thirtyeight, thirty-nine," the old rogue was saying when Davos and the captain came down the hatch. Today he wore a wine-colored tunic and high boots of bleached white leather inlaid with silver scrollwork. Pulling the stopper from a jar, he sniffed, sneezed, and said, "A coarse grind, and of the second quality, my nose declares. The bill of lading is saying forty-three jars. Where have the others gotten to, I am wondering? These Pentoshi, do they think I am not counting?" When he saw Davos he stopped suddenly. "Is it pepper stinging my eyes, or tears? Is this the knight of the onions who stands before me? No, how can it be, my dear friend Davos died on the burning river, all agree. Why has he come to haunt me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos was reminded of Patchface, Princess Shireen's lackwit fool. He had gone into the sea as well, and when he came out he was mad. Am I mad as well?

<div class="line_en">"What else? My onion knight was never so thin or so pale as you." Salladhor Saan threaded his way between the jars of spice and bolts of cloth that filled the hold of the merchanter, wrapped Davos in a fierce embrace, then kissed him once on each cheek and a third time on his forehead.

Much gold is owed, oh yes, but I am not without reason, so in place of coin I have taken a handsome parchment, very crisp. It bears the name and seal of Lord Alester Florent, the Hand of the King. I am made Lord of Blackwater Bay, and no vessel may be crossing my lordly waters without my lordly leave, no. And when these outlaws are trying to steal past me in the night to avoid my lawful duties and customs, why, they are no better than smugglers, so I am well within my rights to seize them." The old pirate laughed. "I cut off no man's fingers, though. What good are bits of fingers? The ships I am taking, the cargoes, a few ransoms, nothing unreasonable." He gave Davos a sharp look.

<div class="line_en">When the fool saw Davos, he jerked to a sudden halt, the bells on his antlered tin helmet going ting-a-ling, ting-a-ling. Hopping from one foot to the other, he sang, "Fool's blood, king's blood, blood on the maiden's thigh, but chains for the guests and chains for the bridegroom, aye aye aye." Shireen almost caught him then, but at the last instant he hopped over a patch of bracken and vanished among the trees. The princess was right behind him. The sight of them made Davos smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弄臣看见戴佛斯，竟真的猛然站住。他单脚跳来跳去，锡桶鹿角盔上的铃铛响个不停，叮，叮，他唱道：“弄臣血，国王血，处女大腿也流血，链子拴宾客啊，大人，链子拴新郎啊，我知道，我知道，噢噢噢！”希琳差点就赶上他了，但他唱完却立刻跳过蕨丛，消失在树林里，公主拔腿就追。此情此景，让戴佛斯不由得笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why have they brought me here? Davos wondered. Then he heard a faint ringing of bells, and a child's giggle, and suddenly the fool Patchface popped from the bushes, shambling along as fast as he could go with the Princess Shireen hot on his heels. "You come back now," she was shouting after him. "Patches, you come back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们为何带我来这儿？戴佛斯不明白。附近传来铃铛轻响和孩子的欢笑，弄臣补丁脸从灌木丛中跳将出来，摇摇晃晃，古怪横行，希琳公主则风风火火地紧跟在后。“站住，”她对他大喊，“阿丁，你给我站住。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had turned to cough into his gloved hand when another small shape crashed out of the hedge and bowled right into him, knocking him off his feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aegon's Garden had a pleasant piney smell to it, and tall dark trees rose on every side. There were wild roses as well, and towering thorny hedges, and a boggy spot where cranberries grew.</div>

<div class="line_en">"As you say, my lord." Robert was a different man than Stannis, true enough. The boy is like him. Aye, and like Renly as well. That thought made him anxious.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy was about to say something more when they heard steps. Davos turned. Ser Axell Florent was coming down the garden path with a dozen guards in quilted jerkins. On their breasts they wore the fiery heart of the Lord of Light. Queen's men, Davos thought. A cough came on him suddenly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩刚要开口，突然传来脚步声。戴佛斯转身，只见亚赛尔？佛罗伦爵士带着十来个卫兵，沿着花园小径走来。卫兵们穿着加垫上衣，胸口绣有光之王的烈焰红心。后党人士，戴佛斯心想，突然又开始咳嗽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Axell was short and muscular, with a barrel chest, thick arms, bandy legs, and hair growing from his ears. The queen's uncle, he had served as castellan of Dragonstone for a decade, and had always treated Davos courteously, knowing he enjoyed the favor of Lord Stannis. But there was neither courtesy nor warmth in his tone as he said, "Ser Davos, and undrowned. How can that be?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚赛尔爵士矮胖结实，酒桶一样的胸膛，双臂粗壮，腿脚弯曲，耳毛密集，身为王后的伯伯，担任龙石岛代理城主已有十年之久。他知戴佛斯深受史坦尼斯信赖，故而对他颇为礼遇，但这回开口时，语调却冰冷而无礼，“戴佛斯爵士，你竟没淹死，真是奇迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
