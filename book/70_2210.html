<div class="line_en">Suddenly, the prince spotted a different horse across the way, one that was sprinting haphazardly and was dangerously close to throwing its rider.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quickly guiding his horse toward it, the prince reached out and grabbed the reins, pulling with all his might. The two horses slowed and started to circle each other. It was then that the prince got a good look at the girl astride the other horse. Her hair was tangled about her face, and her dress was mottled with mud. But when she looked at him, her blue eyes were clear and unafraid. For a moment, he found himself lost in their depths, seeing sadness behind the courage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子立刻驱马上前，伸手抓住那匹马的缰绳，全力拉住他。两匹马都慢下来，围着对方转起来。这时王子才细细打量了一下马背上的女孩。女孩的头发散乱地搭在脸上，衣服上沾满了泥水。但当她看向他时，她清澈的蓝眼睛并没有流露出恐惧。一瞬间，王子被这双蓝眼睛吸引住了，这勇敢的眼神里面还有一丝悲伤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The prince let out a sigh. He was tired of the endless hunts. The pageantry of it all… the racing endlessly through the forest after a helpless beast that had done nothing to deserve its fate. Yet he was the prince. The day's hunt had started out like any other. The baying of the hounds as the horn was blown. The initial rush he felt as the throng of horses took off, their heads pulling at the bits in their eagerness. But after that, the prince had felt nothing. He galloped along, his head a million miles away, as men whooped and hollered around him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子叹了一口气。他厌倦了一次又一次的打猎。每一次都是大张旗鼓，场面壮观…还要长时间地在树林中奔袭，猎杀一只没有任何过错的动物。但他是王子。这一天的狩猎还是和以往一样拉开了序幕。猎犬的叫声就是吹响的号角。成群的骏马争先恐后冲出的那一刻，每匹马都使劲扯着马嚼子，他确实感到热血沸腾。但之后，王子就没有了兴奋的感觉。他骑着马一路飞驰，但思绪早已飞出千万里，完全没注意周围的人吵吵嚷嚷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The prince stifled a smile. It was amusing to hear his own thoughts echoed back to him aloud. "I confess I have never met him before. Is he a friend of yours?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子忍住没笑出来。听到自己的心声从另一个人的口里说出来很有趣。“我承认我根本没见过它。它是你的朋友吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“只是相识，”她回答道，“我们刚才遇到过。我看着它的眼睛，它也看着我的眼睛，我觉得它的一生还有很多事情要做。就这些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment, the prince was struck silent. He had never met a girl like this before.

<div class="line_en">The question brought the prince up short. Clearly she didn't know who he was, and he didn't want to spoil the moment by revealing his true identity. He racked his brain, unsure what to say. Finally, he decided to tell her a part truth. "They call me Kit," he said. It was his childhood nickname, used by his father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的问题让王子一下说不出话来。显然她不知道他是谁，所以他不想暴露自己的真实身份破坏现在的气氛。他绞尽脑汁，不知怎么回答。最后，他决定告诉她一部分事实。“他们叫我基特，”他说。这是他小时候的昵称，爸爸以前这么叫他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not alone," the girl said, shrugging. "I'm with you." Then she paused. "What do they call you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是一个人，”女孩耸耸肩说，“不是还有你嘛？”停了一下，她又说：“你叫什么名字？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I, uh, live at the palace," he stammered. "My father is teaching me his trade." Again, it wasn't exactly a lie. He did live at the palace, though his "trade" was not traditional.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我，呃，住在王宫里，”他结结巴巴地说，“我父亲在教我学他的行当。”这话也不完全是假话，他确实住在王宫，尽管他的“行当”非同寻常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The prince watched as she began to check her horse, clearly anxious to make sure he was all right. She seemed undaunted by the forest around her and the strange man in front of her. "You shouldn't be this deep in the forest alone," the prince said, trying not to stare at her hair, turned golden by the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子见她又开始查看她的马，生怕它有什么闪失。身处密林深处，面对一个陌生男子，她好像一点也不害怕。“你不该独自到这样的树林深处来，”王子说，眼睛尽量不去看她被阳光染成金黄色的头发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," Kit said, his voice gentle. For some reason, the sadness in her eyes made him angry. He wanted to find out who would cause such a look in a girl who seemed so strong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很抱歉，”基特轻柔地说。不知道为什么，女孩眼睛里的悲伤让他感到愤怒。他想知道到底是谁让这位坚强的女孩看起来如此难过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not your doing," the girl replied. Then she straightened her shoulders and her eyes grew bright again. "It's not so very bad. Others have it worse, I'm sure. We must simply have courage and be kind, mustn't we?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没做错什么，”女孩回答道。她挺起肩膀，眼睛又变得明亮起来。“还不算太坏。我肯定这世上有人比我更糟。我们必须坚强勇敢，仁慈善良，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit was beginning to feel slightly guilty. He didn't want to lie to her, but this was one of the most interesting conversations he had had in a while. That would change if she found out he was royalty. "Better than I deserve, most likely," he finally answered. Then, trying to change the subject, he asked, "And you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特开始感到有点内疚。他不想骗她，但他很久没有这么有趣地和人谈话了。如果她知道他是王室成员，他们就不能这么谈下去了。“好得让我受之有愧，”他答道。为了改变话题，他问道：“你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit was taken aback. "Yes, you're right." It was a simple notion, but the girl said it with such conviction. It echoed his own feelings, and he felt himself on the verge of saying so. But then the sound of a horn echoed through the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特吃了一惊：“是的，你说得对。”这么简单的一句话，但是女孩却说得如此信心十足。他心里也是这么想的，所以差点也脱口而出了。这时森林里响起了号角的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another peal of the hunting horn blasted through the woods, and at the edge of the clearing a man on horseback appeared. Kit stifled a groan. This was his captain of the guard, and he was obviously not pleased the prince had slipped his watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又一阵号角声从树林里响起，一个人骑着马出现在一片空地的边缘。基特心里叫苦不迭。这人是他的侍卫长，看到王子溜出了他的视线，他显然不太高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我也是，”她回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="王子赶紧打断他。“是基特。我是基特。”他故意强调道，“我马上就来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She returned his smile. "Thank you very much, Mr. Kit," she said.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“殿——”侍卫长正要叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An amused expression crossed the Captain's face, but he left it at that. Kit met the girl's gaze. "I hope that I will see you again," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="侍卫长被逗乐了，但他没有刨根问底。基特看着女孩的眼睛说：“希望能再见到你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before either of them could say anything else, the horn gave another frantic blast, and Kit turned his horse. As he galloped away, he snuck one last look over his shoulder. The girl stood there, holding her horse's reins in one hand, the other raised in a wave goodbye. As she disappeared from sight, Kit felt a funny sadness fill his chest. She was the most interesting girl he had ever met. What if he never got to see her again?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没等他们再说话，又响起一阵急促的号角声，基特拨转马头。疾驰中，他又回头暗中看了女孩一眼。女孩站在那儿，一只手牵着缰绳，另一只手挥动着向基特告别。看着她消失在视线中，基特心中感到一阵莫名的难过。她是基特遇到的最有意思的女孩，如果以后再也见不到了怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day Kit stood in his father's bedroom, waiting as the royal physician finished his examination of the king. The older man stood there, clearly annoyed by a process that was becoming all too familiar. Finally, the visit over, Kit helped his father back into his tunic and then began to lead him toward a chair. But his father shooed him away and deliberately continued to stand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，基特站在父亲的卧房里，等着御医给父亲检查身体。父亲站在那里，显然这司空见惯的检查程序让他厌烦。终于，医生检查完了，基特帮父亲穿上外衣，然后想扶他坐到一张椅子上。父亲朝他嘘了一声，故意站在那里不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You sound as if you're the first fellow who ever met a pretty girl," King Frederick said, continuing their earlier conversation. Ever since Kit had arrived home from the previous day's hunt, he had talked of nothing but this mysterious girl in the woods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说得好像只有你遇见过漂亮姑娘一样，”弗雷德里克国王接着他们之前的谈话说道。基特昨天打猎一回来，嘴里谈的都是他遇到的那个神秘女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你只见过她一次，怎么会了解她呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit let out a sigh. "She wasn't a pretty girl," he retorted. Then he corrected himself. "Well, she was a pretty girl. But there was so much more to her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特叹了口气。“她不是个漂亮姑娘，”他反驳道。然后又纠正道：“好吧，她是个漂亮姑娘。但是她可不只是长得漂亮。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit had a quick answer for that. "You told me you knew right away when you met Mother." The king groaned. His son was as stubborn as he had been at that age. "That's different," he snapped. "Your mother was a princess."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特立刻回答道：“你告诉过我，你和母亲不也是一见钟情吗？”国王叹了口气。儿子和他年轻时一样固执。“那不一样，”他喝道，“你母亲是一位公主。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kit smiled. "No, you wouldn't." Then he turned to the doctor, who had been quietly packing up his tools and trying hard not to listen in on the conversation. "How is he?" The doctor took a moment, as though trying to figure out the best way to deliver the news.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特笑道：“不，你不会的。”接着他转向御医问道：“陛下怎么样？”他们争论时，御医一直在旁边悄悄地收拾工具，尽量不去偷听他们的谈话。医生考虑了一下，仿佛在想怎么告诉他们这个消息最合适。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the corridor they were joined by two men, the Grand Duke and the Captain of the Guard. While the Captain was tall and muscular, the Grand Duke was shorter, his round belly sticking out over his pants. Despite their physical differences, the two men had two common goals -- to keep the king and prince safe and to look after the well-being of the kingdom. How they did so differed, however. The Grand Duke followed the letter of the law to a tee; the Captain was a bit more lax, making him Kit's ally on more than one occasion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走廊里，两个人迎了上来，是公爵和侍卫长。侍卫长高大健壮，而公爵则个头矮一些，挺着圆圆的肚子。尽管他们长相大不相同，但他们有两个共同的目标——确保国王和王子的安全，为王国的富强效力。但他们的做法也不相同。公爵奉行的是法律条文，不能有任何马虎；侍卫长就没那么刻板，所以经常和王子站到一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A flash of blue eyes and blond hair popped into Kit's mind, and he found himself echoing the girl's words. "Just because it's what's done doesn't mean it's what should be done." The three older men stopped and stared at him. Kit shrugged. "Or something like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特的脑海中突然浮现出瑞拉的蓝眼睛和金黄色的头发，他不禁说出瑞拉的话：“正常并不表示这种做法就是正确的。”国王和两个大臣停下来看着他。基特耸耸肩道：“或者和这差不多的意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He turned and addressed the Captain. "What have you got to say?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个人又继续朝前走。“还是成天异想天开。”弗雷德里克国王忍着笑说道。尽管他不会大声地承认这一点，但是他还记得年轻时积极乐观的心情。“本以为带兵打仗能让你有点理智。”他转过头问侍卫长道：“你有什么要说的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I shall endeavor to please, Your Highness," the artist replied seriously. Then, taking a quick look at Kit, who was doing his best to look awkward and very unmarriageable, he added under his breath, "But I can't work bloody miracles." He turned back to a large canvas that stretched at least a dozen feet into the air. Already the beginnings of the portrait could be seen -- the prince, astride a beautiful horse, holding a sword high in his hand as though to say, "Onward!" The only thing left to do was the face -- if Kit would cooperate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我尽力而为，陛下。”艺术家严肃地回答。他快速扫了基特一眼，基特却极力做出笨拙、不适合结婚的样子来，画家压低嗓子接着说道：“但我可创造不出奇迹。”他转过来看着巨大的画布，画布支得有十几英尺高。肖像已经初见端倪——王子骑着一匹漂亮的马，手里高举着宝剑，仿佛在呼喊：“前进！”唯一剩下的是面部——如果基特愿意合作的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kit started to laugh but a stern look from the artist stopped him. "At this ball you and the Grand Duke insist upon?" The ball had been the topic of discussion for far too long in his opinion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特笑了起来，但艺术家严厉的目光打断了他。“就在您和公爵坚持要举办的这次舞会上？”对他来说，这次舞会已经讨论太长时间了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The prince begrudgingly climbed onto a saddle on a sawhorse. "So these portraits will be sent abroad?" he asked out of the corner of his mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting on his fake horse, Kit wanted to scream. He had been born into this life. He had not asked for it, and now he felt as though he were a prized pig being fattened up to sell at market. He knew he was lucky in many ways. But the freedom of the girl in the woods? That was something he could never have.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在假马上的基特只想大声尖叫。他一出生就面临着这样的生活。他并没有祈求这种生活，他感觉自己现在就像一头被视为宝贝的猪，等长壮了就要被牵到市场上卖掉。他知道自己在很多方面都很幸运，但是像树林里的那个女孩般自由自在？他永远不可能拥有这种自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At which you will choose a bride," the king said. Kit shot him a look, and King Frederick went on, his voice stern. "It has always been done; it is how it will be done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这次舞会上你要选择一位新娘，”国王说。基特看了他一眼，弗雷德里克国王继续用严肃的口吻说：“以前一直是这么做的，以后还会是这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Taking a gentler tone, the king tried to make the point clear. "You will be king soon, Son. You know I am not well." The others began to protest but he hushed them and went on.

<div class="line_cn" title="国王想用更温和的口气把事情说清楚：“你马上会成为国王，儿子。你知道我身体不好。”其他人赶紧劝慰国王，但他打断了他们，继续说道：“我自己的事情，我倒不介意。我这一生很幸福。但我想要你——还有整个王国——平平安安。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kit felt a wave of remorse for being so stubborn. His father was ill and he meant well. Suddenly, Kit had an idea. Perhaps there was a way to appease his father and get a chance to see the girl from the woods again. He knew that if his father met her, he would see why Kit was so intrigued. "All right, I will agree to the ball." The Grand Duke began to clap, but Kit went on. "On one condition. The invitations go to everyone, not just the nobility. The wars have brought sorrow enough." He looked at his father. "If you were in my place, you would do the same."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基特为自己的固执感到一丝懊悔。父亲生了病，他是一片好心。突然，基特有了一个主意。或许有一个办法既可以安抚父亲，又可以有机会再见到树林里的那位姑娘。他知道如果父亲见了她，就会明白自己为什么会念念不忘。“好吧，我同意举办舞会。”公爵高兴得鼓起掌来，但基特继续说道：“有一个条件。邀请要传达到每一个人，不能只是贵族。战争带来的悲伤已经够沉重了。”他看着父亲说：“如果您是我，您也会这么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
