<p>Nigeria is home to a growing number of technology companies and young business leaders.</p>
<p>Some business leaders have been seeking government help for their startup companies. Recently, several young <strong>entrepreneurs </strong>competed for a chance to tell President Muhammadu Buhari about their companies. </p>
<p>Nigeria's technology <strong>sector</strong> is growing, in part, because of <strong>ambitious</strong> entrepreneurs like Angel Adelaja, a Nigerian American. She is chief executive officer of a company called Fresh Direct Nigeria. It seeks to reduce the country's dependence on food imports by growing cabbage and other vegetables in containers.</p>
<p>"We take a 20-foot container that you would put a car in to ship and we <strong>kit </strong>it with <strong>hydroponic</strong> farming technology and we farm vertically. And we're growing <strong>premium </strong>produce -- vegetables, cabbage, lettuce -- so many different things inside the containers."</p>
<p>First Direct Nigeria is designed for the expanding class of health conscious people who live in the city.</p>
<p>A business called Grit Systems Engineering manufactures a device for measuring energy use. The company is the idea of Ifedayo Oludapo.</p>
<p>"I am the founder of Grit Systems and what we make is a web-enabled multisource energy monitoring device -- kind of like a utility meter, but it measures power <strong>consumption</strong> from all the different power sources you have, which is a big deal in an under-electrified environment like Nigeria."</p>
<p>Emma Okene leads Tracology, another Nigerian company. He and his team created a <strong>bar code</strong> that is placed on the front gate of a person's home. By using a device that reads bar code information, waste collection crews will be able to know if the home owner has paid for their services.</p>
<p>"Once the utility provider comes to the house all he has to do is just <strong>scan</strong> this bar code and he knows in real time whether you've paid for that waste or whatever service he wants to offer you and he <strong>renders</strong> it."</p>
<p>A total of 30 tech entrepreneurs competed for the chance to meet with the Nigerian president and vice president. Three were chosen, including Emma Okene of Tracology. He won a prize of more than $8,000.</p>
<p>Last week, the Nigerian economy entered into a recession for the first time in more than 20 years. Government <strong>revenue</strong> is sharply reduced because of the drop in oil prices worldwide. So the government is interested in supporting technology companies, hoping they may be able to fuel the economy.</p>
<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was at the competition last week. He spoke at the end of his first visit to Nigeria.</p>
<p>"You know, this trip has really blown me away by the, the talent of the entrepreneurs and developers in this country and by the <strong>focus</strong> on building something that's gonna make a difference and gonna make a change. I think that if you keep on doing this you're not only gonna shape Nigeria and all of Africa, but the whole world."</p>
<p>Nigerian government officials hope one of the startup companies can be as successful as Facebook.</p>
