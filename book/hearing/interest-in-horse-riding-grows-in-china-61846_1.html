[00:00.00]Across Asia, the increase
[00:02.10]in sales of high-priced goods and services
[00:05.19]has been partly fueled by the rise of China's middle class.
[00:10.02]Among the activities enjoyed by some wealthy Chinese
[00:14.07]is the ownership of horses.
[00:16.60]The quality of life tied to horses and horse ownership
[00:21.34]has become a new sign of success among a small,
[00:24.91]but growing group of people in China.
[00:28.49]Sports involving horses have not always been permitted in China.
[00:34.34]Former Chinese leader Mao Zedong banned horse racing in 1949.
[00:41.24]More than 60 years later, race tracks, polo fields
[00:46.39]and jockey clubs are opening for business in Chinese cities.
[00:51.43]And, there is a rising number of horses imported from overseas.
[00:57.08]Maiken Jaeschke is with Equestrian Globe,
[01:02.46]a German company that imports horses into China.
[01:06.39]It also builds equestrian facilities
[01:09.61]and sells riding gear and equipment.
[01:12.78]"China has seen a huge increase in the equestrian world
[01:17.32]and the equestrian market in general,
[01:19.19]and the interest in horses and horse sports
[01:22.44]over the last 10 years or five years, intensively."
[01:28.92]China now has 25 horse racing tracks
[01:33.06]and 300 equestrian clubs. 
[01:36.02]Land developers are building a $2 billion equestrian center
[01:41.30]in the city of Tianjin.
[01:43.49]It is called the Tianjin Equine Culture City.
[01:48.51]The developers have promised to build 4,000 stables to house horses.
[01:55.01]They have also said they will build
[01:57.80]a state-of-the-art medical center for the animals,
[02:01.71]150 trainer offices and training areas.
[02:06.72]The development also will include a racecourse,
[02:11.41]clubhouse and an international equestrian college.
[02:16.63]Shen Ge lives in Beijing. He buys horses.
[02:23.28]His 15-year-old daughter, Shen Qing,
[02:26.54]is one of the youngest competitive riders in China.
[02:30.59]She competes internationally in show jumping.
[02:34.97]Shen Ge says there is a real interest in equestrian sports in China.
[02:42.36]But bad dealings between European horse sellers and Chinese buyers
[02:48.39]have damaged trust in the international market.
[02:52.40]He notes examples of Chinese buyers attempting to negotiate deals for horses,
[02:59.97]and then canceling contracts at the last minute.
[03:03.92]He says some buyers even disappeared after a horse was sent to China,
[03:10.45]and the seller had already spent thousands of dollars on shipping.
[03:15.31]Such stories do not concern American David Snodgrass.
[03:21.49]He brought the first American quarter horses to China. 
[03:26.01]He says the Chinese market for quarter horses
[03:29.98]has increased in the past few years.
[03:33.32]"We work in saddlebreds and standardbreds and with those breeds
[03:39.99]we've seen steady growth over the last three or four years."
[03:46.55]Horse sellers say the market will only grow as interest in the sport increases.
[03:52.96]Shen Ge has built his career in business marketing.
[03:57.32]He says his love of horses keeps him in the stables
[04:02.12]during most of his free time.
[04:04.55]He has passed this interest to his daughter, Shen Qing.
[04:09.10]He says she represents the future of the Chinese equestrian market.
