<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:In Asia, Supply, Power Shortages Hurt Growth]

。
[00:00.04]Many Asian countries that depend on exports
[00:04.44]are facing supply shortages, power cuts and other problems.
[00:11.68]Information released Thursday
[00:14.68]showed that Japan’s factory production has slowed
[00:19.32]and expectations for China’s manufacturing have weakened.
[00:26.52]Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corporation became the latest automaker
[00:32.68]to freeze production lines for several days
[00:37.08]because of a lack of parts.
[00:40.80]Suzuki said it expected to suspend operations
[00:46.12]at a factory in central Japan.
[00:49.44]Another factory is also expected to freeze production for two days.
[00:58.32]Japan’s emergency coronavirus measures ended on September 30.
[01:05.32]But other countries have put restrictions back in place.
[01:10.92]This has made experts unsure about economic conditions.
[01:18.36]Pandemic-related shutdowns have affected manufacturers across Asia.
[01:26.88]In Japan, factory production in August
[01:31.24]fell by 3.2 percent from the month before.
[01:37.28]Automakers and producers of information technology products
[01:43.44]and other electronic equipment were the hardest hit,
[01:48.16]the Japanese government reported.
[01:52.16]Other automakers also have slowed operations.
[01:57.40]They say shortages of computer chips and other parts
[02:02.88]are interfering with normal production.
[02:07.48]Retail sales in Japan fell 4.1 percent from a month earlier.
[02:15.48]That was more than expected.
[02:18.28]Weak demand for clothing
[02:20.92]and appliances were blamed for the decrease.
[02:26.72]In a commentary, Harumi Taguchi
[02:30.76]of research company IHS Markit warned:
[02:35.60]“Risks of semiconductor and other component shortages
[02:41.04]could persist for an extended period.”
[02:46.20]Semiconductors are very important part for electronics.
[02:53.04]Taguchi blamed new coronavirus infections in some countries
[02:59.12]and slow vaccination campaigns in Southeast Asia.
[03:06.28]In addition to Japan, an official study of factory managers
[03:12.80]showed that Chinese manufacturing also slowed in August.
[03:19.88]The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index
[03:24.28]is a widely-used measure of business activity.
[03:30.04]For China, the index number
[03:32.80]fell from 50.1 in August to 49.6 in September.
[03:41.56]An index value of less than 50
[03:45.32]means that business activity is decreasing
[03:49.72]while a value over 50 means it is expanding.
[03:56.16]The study was carried out before power shortages
[04:00.92]began causing factories in some parts of China
[04:05.00]to suspend operations.
[04:10.16]Julian Evans-Pritchard of researcher Capital Economics
[04:16.08]said in a report that the chemical and metal industries,
[04:21.56]which are energy intensive, showed the most weakness.
[04:26.96]Pritchard said that business leaders
[04:30.92]“noted that material shortages
[04:33.84]and transportation delays were still holding back output.”
[04:39.68]Increasing demand for computers
[04:43.56]for people working from home instead of the office
[04:47.64]has resulted in limited supplies of computer parts.
[04:53.96]Shortages of shipping containers
[04:56.84]and temporary shutdowns of ports
[05:00.12]because of COVID-19 outbreaks also have led to slowdowns
[05:07.08]in bringing products to market.
[05:10.48]The Dutch bank Rabobank said in a report on the shipping industry
[05:16.88]that closures of ports have had long-term effects.
[05:23.16]Rabobank reported: “Chinese and South-east Asian ports
[05:29.36]are still suffering the consequences of those earlier closures,
[05:35.80]with record queues of ships waiting to unload.”
[05:42.04]Queue means a line of people or things in waiting.
[05:48.20]It estimated that 10 percent of shipping containers around the world
[05:54.40]are on ships waiting to be unloaded at a port.
