。
[00:00.68]Twenty years ago on an Indonesian island,
[00:05.04]scientists discovered ancient bone remains
[00:09.04]of an early human species
[00:11.68]that stood about one meter tall.
[00:15.12]These early humans became popularly
[00:18.20]known as "hobbits."
[00:20.60]The name comes from
[00:22.48]the small humanlike creatures
[00:25.00]that appear in books
[00:26.84]by English writer J.R.R Tolkien.
[00:31.08]Now a new study suggests
[00:33.40]ancestors of the "hobbits"
[00:35.76]were even shorter.
[00:38.04]Yousuke Kaifu of the University of Tokyo
[00:42.04]was a co-writer of the study.
[00:45.68]Kaifu said in an email,
[00:48.24]"We did not expect
[00:49.72]that we would find smaller individuals
[00:52.92]from such an old site."
[00:55.72]The discoverers of the first hobbit fossils
[00:59.24]named them after characters
[01:01.52]in the The Lord of the Rings books.
[01:04.64]The fossils date back to between 60,000
[01:08.16]and 100,000 years ago.
[01:11.64]Researchers found the new fossils
[01:14.20]at a place called Mata Menge,
[01:17.36]about 70 kilometers from the cave
[01:20.44]where researchers found
[01:22.12]the first hobbit remains.
[01:23.68]In 2016, researchers suspected
[01:28.52]the earlier relatives
[01:30.32]could be shorter than the hobbits
[01:32.64]after studying a jawbone and teeth
[01:35.76]collected from the new site.
[01:38.64]Additional examination of a
[01:41.16]small arm bone piece and teeth suggests
[01:45.36]the ancestors were 6 centimeters shorter
[01:48.96]and existed 700,000 years ago.
[01:53.24]Dean Falk of Florida State University
[01:56.80]was not involved with the research.
[02:00.40]Falk said that the researchers in the study have
[02:03.92]"convincingly shown that
[02:05.80]these were very small individuals."
[02:09.32]The findings appeared recently
[02:11.40]in the publication Nature Communications.
[02:15.00]Researchers have debated how the hobbits –
[02:19.32]named Homo floresiensis
[02:22.00]after the Indonesian island of Flores –
[02:25.36]developed to be so small
[02:27.72]and where they fall
[02:29.08]in the human evolutionary story.
[02:32.60]Homo floresiensis are thought
[02:35.16]to be among the last
[02:36.64]early human species to die off.
[02:39.92]Scientists do not yet know
[02:42.88]whether the hobbits shrank from an earlier,
[02:45.80]taller human species called Homo erectus
[02:49.56]that lived in the area,
[02:51.76]or from an even more
[02:53.52]primitive human ancestor.
[02:56.20]Scientists need more study,
[02:58.64]and more fossils,
[03:00.20]to learn the hobbits' place
[03:02.08]in human evolution,
[03:04.04]said Matt Tocheri of Canada's
[03:06.68]Lakehead University.
[03:08.84]In an email, Tocheri,
[03:11.12]who was not involved in the research,
[03:13.88]wrote, "This question remains unanswered
[03:17.52]and will continue to be a focus of research
[03:21.04]for some time to come."
