<p>In a January 15, 1809 letter to Charles Willson Peale, who worked with Hawkins to develop and perfect the machine, Jefferson wrote: "The use of the polygraph has <strong>spoiled</strong> me for the old copying press the copies of which are hardly ever <strong>legible</strong>," adding, "I could not, now therefore, live without the Polygraph."</p>
<p>Morrill remembered that a visitor once told him, "What is it about you Americans and this new, new thing? Other cultures aren't like this.

。
[00:00.04]Humans have been writing by hand
[00:03.56]for thousands of years.
[00:05.80]Since ancient times,
[00:07.96]people have used every tool imaginable
[00:11.44]to share information,
[00:13.20]do business, and keep records.
[00:16.44]But as computers took over the job
[00:19.68]and the type-written word became more common,
[00:23.08]something was lost in the process;
[00:26.40]namely, the charm and personal nature
[00:29.92]of a hand-written note or letter.
[00:33.16]Now, letter writing is making a comeback
[00:36.92]in the form of artificial intelligence-operated robots.
[00:42.08]These AI robots can write notes for humans
[00:46.32]in their own handwriting.
[00:49.12]David Wachs is the head and founder of Handwrytten.
[00:53.24]He said businesses use his company's robots
[00:57.24]for handwritten letters and "thank-you" notes
[01:01.12]to create a strong and personal connection
[01:04.64]with those who receive them.
[01:08.20]Many non-profit organizations
[01:10.80]also use handwritten letters
[01:13.16]to keep donations coming.
[01:15.48]It helps turn one-time givers, or donors,
[01:19.68]into yearly givers, Wachs explained.
[01:23.32]Wachs added, "I think what's old is new again."
[01:28.64]Automated letter writing is not new.
[01:31.56]Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. President,
[01:35.52]often used a polygraph
[01:37.68]created by British inventor John Isaac Hawkins.
[01:43.08]Jefferson considered the device
[01:45.48]the greatest invention of his time.
[01:48.72]It let him make copies of his letters
[01:51.68]to keep for his own records.
[01:54.88]Charles Morrill is a historian
[01:57.60]and professional woodworker
[01:59.68]who worked as a guide for several years at Monticello,
[02:03.92]Jefferson's Virginia home from 1770
[02:07.84]until his death in 1826.
[02:11.92]Morrill said about the polygraph,
[02:14.56]"Jefferson falls in love with this
[02:17.16]and it becomes in many ways
[02:19.48]the hobby of his presidency...
[02:22.04]He keeps buying machines
[02:24.52]and exchanges ones that are not quite perfect
[02:28.00]for the next one that's a little bit better."
[02:31.76]The president had more than
[02:33.88]ten of the devices at one point, Morrill added.
[02:37.96]Using what he considered wonderful technology,
[02:41.84]historians say Jefferson went on to write
[02:45.48]almost 20,000 letters in his lifetime.
[02:49.48]In a January 15, 1809 letter
[02:53.48]to Charles Willson Peale,
[02:55.72]who worked with Hawkins
[02:57.16]to develop and perfect the machine,
[02:59.88]Jefferson wrote: "The use of the polygraph
[03:03.68]has spoiled me for the old copying press
[03:06.88]the copies of which are hardly ever legible,"
[03:10.24]adding, "I could not, now therefore,
[03:13.56]live without the Polygraph."
[03:16.56]Morrill remembered that a visitor once told him,
[03:20.08]"What is it about you Americans and this new, new thing?
[03:24.40]Other cultures aren't like this.
[03:26.80]You Americans are just so absolutely convinced
[03:31.00]that the next new thing is going to do it;
[03:34.48]the latest software, the latest computer, the latest phone."
[03:39.60]"And I think this kind of begins
[03:41.96]with Jefferson," Morrill added.
[03:45.04]Handwriting technology has greatly changed
[03:48.36]since Jefferson's time.
[03:50.52]Wachs says such technology now includes
[03:53.92]3D printing and laser cutting, among others.
[03:58.08]And if users need help
[03:59.96]thinking of exactly what to write in their notes,
[04:03.28]they can choose AI
[04:04.84]to help them create a more effective message.
[04:08.20]Whether via the printing press or the polygraph,
[04:12.08]a computer or a robot, one thing is clear...
[04:16.08]humans will use whatever tool they have
[04:19.08]to express themselves through the printed word.
