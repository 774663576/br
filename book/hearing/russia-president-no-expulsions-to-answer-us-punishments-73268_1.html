<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Russia’s President: No Expulsions to Answer US Punishments]

。
[00:00.12]Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday
[00:04.32]that he has decided not to expel American diplomats from his country.
[00:11.36]Russia's foreign minister had suggested expelling United States diplomats
[00:17.44]and other measures to answer U.S. sanctions against Russia.
[00:23.80]On Thursday, President Barack Obama ordered 35 Russians to be expelled
[00:31.48]from the United States and other measures.
[00:35.88]The moves came after U.S. intelligence agencies
[00:40.96]said Russia hacked Democratic Party computers and released stolen emails.
[00:48.92]The agencies said this was done to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.
[00:57.20]Putin said Russia "has reasons" to take action against the U.S.
[01:04.56]But he said he will wait to "plan out further steps"
[01:09.00]based on the policies of the incoming administration.
[01:14.44]Republican Donald Trump will replace Democrat Barack Obama as president on January 20.
[01:22.80]The Russian officials were ordered to leave the country within 72 hours.
[01:29.52]In addition, Obama ordered the closing of two Russian properties inside the U.S.
[01:37.20]He also ordered sanctions against nine Russian individuals,
[01:43.20]companies and agencies, including the Russian intelligence service.
[01:50.24]"All Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions," Obama said in a statement.
[01:57.28]He said the "theft" of computer emails and other data,
[02:02.56]and their release through WikiLeaks,
[02:05.60]were done to "interfere" with the 2016 U.S. election.
[02:11.84]A senior Obama administration official said the United States believes
[02:17.52]Russia "will continue to interfere" with elections in other countries" and in future U.S. elections.
[02:27.20]Trump also released a statement after Obama's announcement.
[02:32.44]He said, "It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things."
[02:39.80]Trump added: "Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people,
[02:47.28]I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week
[02:51.52]in order to be updated on the facts of this situation."
[02:56.32]When Trump becomes president, he could move to cancel the sanctions ordered by Obama.
[03:04.52]But he might find opposition from Republicans in Congress
[03:09.00]who have called for punishments against Putin and his government.
[03:13.80]Putin's decision not to take action against the new U.S. sanctions came as a surprise.
[03:21.88]Just hours before Putin's announcement,  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
[03:28.28]suggested Russia would remove 31 American diplomats and take other action.
[03:35.40]Putin said he decided against any actions -- for now.
[03:41.52]"The Russian diplomats returning home will spend the New Year holidays
[03:47.32]with their relatives and dear ones," Putin said in a statement.
[03:52.20]"We will not create problems for U.S. diplomats.
[03:57.04]We will not expel anybody."
[04:00.56]Putin said he is inviting all children of U.S. diplomats to holiday parties at the Kremlin.
[04:09.24]Dmitry Trenin is director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.
[04:14.28]Trenin said Putin's decision not to act against the U.S. sanctions
[04:20.48]appears to be an "investment" in the possibility of better relations with President-elect Donald Trump.
[04:29.16]Trenin made his comment on Twitter.
