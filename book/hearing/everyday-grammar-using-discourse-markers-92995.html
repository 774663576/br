Imagine you are watching an old American movie -- the crime film “Dirty Harry.”</p>
<p>You have heard that one part of the film is very famous in American culture.</p>
<p>You watch the <strong>scene</strong>, which sounds like this:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Using Discourse Markers in American English " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/db01b03d-07d5-4c83-8ecf-e98da144d4f7_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Using Discourse Markers in American English </span></div>

<p><em>You go to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, do you, punk?</em></p>
<p>A sudden, strange thought comes to your mind. What is the purpose of the word <em>well?</em></p>
<p>You have heard different English speakers use the word in different ways, but you are not sure what it means.</p>
<p>In our Everyday Grammar report, we will explore the common <strong>adverb</strong> <em>well</em>. We will show you how Americans use it while they are speaking.</p>
<p>Do not fear. Unlike an unexpected meeting with Dirty Harry, this report will be painless!</p>
<p><strong>What are adverbs?</strong></p>
<p>Adverbs are one of the most difficult subjects in English grammar. They are difficult because they represent a large group of words that have different uses.</p>
<p>In general, the definition of an adverb is this: a word that describes a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or a sentence.</p>
<p>Adverbs are often used to show time, place or a way of doing things. They can also show a <strong>degree</strong> or measurement of something.</p>
<p>Consider the sentence, "I really like English grammar." The adverb <em>really </em>changes the meaning of the verb <em>like</em>. The adverb <em>really</em> increases the force of the statement.</p>
<p>There are also sentence adverbs. They limit or describe the meaning of an entire statement.</p>
<p>Sentence adverbs also provide more information about the sentence. These are sometimes called <strong>conjunctive adverbs</strong> or discourse markers. <strong>Regardless</strong> of the name you choose to call them, the purpose is the same: They connect sentences in the same way <strong>coordinating conjunctions</strong> do, but they provide a different kind of information.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p>Let's consider the statement:</p>
<p><em>I love English; <u>however,</u> I do not love English grammar!</em></p>
<p>The word <em>however </em>is a conjunctive adverb that shows a <strong>contrast</strong> or comparison is coming.</p>
<p>You can read more about words like these in an earlier Everyday Grammar story called "Contrast and Concession."</p>
<p><strong>The case of "well"</strong></p>
<p>Today we are considering common conjunctive adverbs, or discourse markers, and how they are used in everyday-speech.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the word <em>well</em>. As you heard at the beginning of today's program, <em>well</em> can have a few different uses.</p>
<p><strong>1. Well indicates contrast or disagreement</strong></p>
<p>The first use is to show a contrast or even a disagreement. Consider this line from the ending of the American film “Some Like It Hot.”</p>
<p><em>"You don't understand, Osgood! I'm a man."</em></p>
<p><em>"<u>Well,</u> nobody's perfect..."</em></p>
<p>Here, the speaker uses <em>well </em>to show that a contrast is coming.</p>
<p>The first speaker, the actor Jack Lemmon, expects the second person to become angry when he states he is not a woman, but a man.</p>
<p>But Osgood reacts in an unexpected, or contrasting way. He does not act surprised at all!</p>
<p><strong>2. Wells shows uncertainty </strong></p>
<p>The second use of <em>well </em>is to show <strong>uncertainty</strong>, especially in answers.</p>
<p>Consider this exchange between two friends.</p>
<p><em>Do you mind if I borrow five dollars?</em></p>
<p><em><u>Well,</u></em><em> I'm not sure if I have any money with me...</em></p>
<p>In this example, the second speaker is a little slow in responding. The word <em>well </em>shows that she is not sure if she has the money. Or, maybe she knows she has five dollars, but she does not want to say so.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the point is that <em>well </em>serves as a word that shows movement between the question and the answer. This <strong>transition</strong> shows that there is some uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>3. To show a conversation is ending</strong></p>
<p>The third common use of <em>well </em>is to show a transition to the end of a conversation.</p>
<p>Consider this example. Imagine you are in a business meeting, and your boss makes the following statement:</p>
<p><em><u>Well,</u> this meeting has been very productive.</em></p>
<p>In this case, the word <em>well </em>is showing a transition to the end of the meeting. Your boss is showing that he wants the meeting to end soon.</p>
<p>In American culture, this is considered a careful, indirect way to end a conversation.</p>
<p>However, if a speaker directs your attention to the word "well," then the meaning changes. The statement can take on an angry, tense sound.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between these two statements:</p>
<p><em><u>Well,</u> this meeting has been very productive.</em></p>
<p><em><u>WELL,</u> this meeting has been very productive.</em></p>
<p>The first statement is a respectful way to end a meeting.</p>
<p>The second statement is a tense, perhaps angry way to bring a meeting to an end. If you heard the second statement in a business meeting, then you should know that something is wrong!</p>
<p><strong>Do you understand the uses of well?</strong></p>
<p>Think back to the movie scene you heard at the beginning of this report. Now that you have learned about the word <em>well, </em>consider what Dirty Harry might have meant.</p>
<p>Like any good crime film, we end with a few questions.</p>
<p>What do you think Dirty Harry meant when he said <em>well?</em> Does he use it in a way that has the same meaning as the uses of <em>well</em> we have discussed, or does he use it in a different way?</p>
