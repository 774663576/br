。
[00:00.04]Late last summer, two football players
[00:03.32]at Indiana State University were killed in a car crash.
[00:08.08]Just over one week ago,
[00:11.48]three football players at the University of Virginia
[00:15.76]were killed when they were shot by a former teammate.
[00:20.76]In both cases, university leaders needed to make a plan
[00:25.96]to support the teammates and friends of the students who died.
[00:31.36]Sherard Clinksdale is the director of athletics,
[00:36.08]or sports at Indiana State.
[00:40.12]He had to find ways to help the students work through their sadness.
[00:44.72]He also had the difficult job of telling the football coach
[00:49.12]and the parents of the students that their children had died.
[00:54.40]"There is no playbook for something like this," Clinksdale said.
[00:59.40]At the University of Virginia, Carla Williams has the top athletic job.
[01:05.24]When the news came out that the students were killed on November 14,
[01:10.20]the university canceled classes and other school activities for two days.
[01:16.76]The school did not play its next football game, either.
[01:21.16]Mental health professionals and dogs
[01:24.60]trained to offer comfort were made available to students.
[01:30.36]Williams said it was important to make counselors available for all students,
[01:35.44]not only the ones who were part of the sports team.
[01:40.32]In recent years, sports leaders at universities
[01:45.48]say they have paid more attention to the mental health of their students.
[01:52.16]A study done in 2019 showed that college presidents
[01:58.80]were also paying more attention to student mental health.
[02:05.12]But in 2021, a survey of college athletes
[02:10.80]found that only 53 percent of those questioned
[02:15.96]thought their coaches took mental health seriously.
[02:21.72]The National Collegiate Athletic Association, or NCAA,
[02:28.04]oversees college sports in the U.S.
[02:33.12]It does not have the power to make colleges
[02:36.80]change their mental health policies.
[02:40.08]But it does offer tools the schools can use to help students.
[02:47.28]Sunday Henry is a doctor who works with students
[02:52.12]at Washington State University.
[02:55.60]She helped the football team there
[02:58.28]deal with the deaths of players in 2018 and 2019.
[03:06.60]Henry said the first part of the plan
[03:09.80]is to bring together all of the team members
[03:13.80]to tell them what happened and the ways they can get help.
[03:21.28]She said she thinks college football coaches are getting better
[03:26.24]at urging their athletes to get mental health help.
[03:30.20]In the past, some players and coaches
[03:34.60]believed getting help was a sign of weakness.
[03:40.72]Henry also said the athletic trainers are usually the best
[03:45.84]at noticing athletes who are having problems.
[03:50.28]The trainers spend a lot of time with the students
[03:54.72]who are recovering from injuries.
[03:58.80]Tony Elliott is the University of Virginia football coach.
[04:03.04]He said he wanted to support his players.
[04:06.52]He added, "Nothing can prepare you for this situation."
[04:12.52]Bryan Blair is the athletic director at the University of Toledo in Ohio.
[04:18.60]He worked in sports at Washington State University
[04:23.20]when the players there died.
[04:26.04]Blair said many of the adults in the sports department
[04:30.32]took a class called Mental Health First Aid.
[04:34.56]He said the adults who work in college sports
[04:38.20]who often have contact with students
[04:40.92]should "be a resource to the student athletes."
[04:45.56]Curt Mallory is the football coach at Indiana State.
[04:49.68]He said he makes time each Monday
[04:53.52]to meet with his student athletes,
[04:56.12]even if it seems like they are doing okay.
[04:59.92]At California's San Jose State University,
[05:04.72]coaches had to react to the death of a player
[05:09.32]who was hit by a bus in October.
[05:13.48]The next football game was postponed.
[05:17.72]The football coaches worked to help the student's family
[05:23.04]and plan a memorial.
[05:27.32]The following week, the school played its game, and won.
[05:34.08]The player who died, Camdan McWright,
[05:38.40]was honored during a special ceremony.
[05:42.64]His family was there to see the memorial.
