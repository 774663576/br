。
[00:00.04]A new study involving stars
[00:03.12]that formed together shows how lucky Earth
[00:07.24]is to be in a normal planetary system.
[00:12.56]Researchers studied 91 pairs of stars
[00:16.88]that formed together
[00:18.96]and were similar in size and substance.
[00:23.80]Their research showed
[00:26.12]that a surprising number showed signs
[00:29.28]of having absorbed a planet.
[00:32.96]The stars likely absorbed a planet
[00:35.88]after it was pushed out of a stable orbit.
[00:41.00]This might have been caused by gravitational influences
[00:45.92]from other planets or even other stars.
[00:51.04]The stars involved are being called "twins"
[00:54.72]because they formed together.
[00:58.16]The researchers call them "co-natal stars,"
[01:01.92]and they had equal masses and ages.
[01:06.52]These "twins" were moving in the same direction
[01:10.40]in the Milky Way galaxy
[01:12.96]but were not connected by gravity.
[01:17.00]Researchers chose the twin stars
[01:20.12]because a star's chemistry
[01:22.56]likely changes when it absorbs a planet.
[01:27.28]The planet would introduce
[01:29.12]amounts of a few elements
[01:31.68]that are not present in a normal star.
[01:36.08]The researchers looked for stars
[01:38.72]that were different from their twin.
[01:42.12]They also tried to identify elements
[01:45.28]in the stars that would show that
[01:48.04]a planet had been absorbed.
[01:51.20]Those elements include iron, nickel, or titanium.
[01:56.92]In at least seven of the twin stars,
[02:00.20]one of the two stars showed signs of absorbing a planet.
[02:06.64]Fan Liu of Monash University in Australia
[02:11.32]was the lead writer of the research
[02:14.48]that was released in the publication Nature.
[02:19.96]Scientist Yuan-Sen Ting
[02:22.84]of the Australian National University
[02:26.76]and The Ohio State University helped write the study.
[02:32.72]He commented that the research really shows
[02:36.12]what a lucky position Earth is in.
[02:40.20]He said, "The stability of a planetary system
[02:44.76]like the solar system is not a given."
[02:49.28]The researchers used the European Space Agency's
[02:53.60]Gaia space observatory to find the twin stars.
[02:59.68]They also used telescopes in Chile and Hawaii
[03:04.36]to identify the chemical elements present in the stars.
[03:10.52]The stars were as close as 70 light years from Earth
[03:15.40]and as far as 960 light years away.
[03:21.32]A light year is the distance light travels in a year,
[03:25.92]or 9.5 trillion kilometers.
[03:30.64]The researchers said it is most likely that their observations
[03:35.92]showed that whole planets had been absorbed.
[03:40.64]But they added it was possible
[03:43.08]they were identifying planetary building blocks
[03:46.88]being absorbed during a system's
[03:49.64]period of planet formation.
[03:53.00]Some stars like our sun expand towards the end of their life.
[03:58.84]During this time, they might absorb nearby planets.
[04:04.00]Later, the stars collapse becoming very small,
[04:08.00]dense stars called white dwarves.
[04:11.88]Ting said all stars like the sun become much larger.
[04:17.40]Ting said Earth will be absorbed by the sun.
[04:21.96]The stars in the study were not nearing the end of their life.
[04:27.08]Instability in planetary systems
[04:30.44]might be more common than once thought.
[04:34.60]About eight percent of the twin stars studied
[04:38.52]had one star that likely absorbed a planet.
[04:43.28]Ting said most planetary systems,
[04:46.56]like our solar system, should be stable.
[04:51.08]He said the reason is that planets
[04:53.52]are mostly influenced by their main star,
[04:57.12]not other planets in their system.
[05:01.00]Ting added that for other planetary systems
[05:04.88]with different beginnings and conditions,
[05:08.28]this might break down.
[05:10.16]That might lead to instability.
[05:14.04]Ting said the study shows
[05:16.12]that many planetary systems are unstable.
[05:20.64]That means there are always
[05:22.72]planets thrown into or out of these systems.
[05:27.72]Since only a small percentage of these planets are absorbed,
[05:32.48]there might be more planets than once thought
[05:35.72]traveling in exile without a star to orbit.
[05:40.84]Ting said, "Understanding which planetary systems
[05:44.92]are stable or not is a long-time goal
[05:49.44]of planetary dynamics theorists."
