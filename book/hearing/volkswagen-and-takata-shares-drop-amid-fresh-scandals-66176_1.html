。
[00:00.40]The price of Volkswagen AG shares dropped Wednesday 
[00:04.96]as a scandal about its truthfulness continued.
[00:09.16]The German car maker said its emissions testing scandal 
[00:13.40]was much bigger than previously believed.  
[00:17.64]The German automaker said Tuesday 
[00:20.40]it lied about carbon dioxide emissions from its cars. 
[00:25.80]It said it gave wrong information to regulators. 
[00:30.36]This could affect about 800,000 more cars 
[00:34.36]and cost at least an extra $2 billion,  reported the Wall Street Journal. 
[00:41.72]The Wall Street Journal reported 
[00:44.12]that VW shares were down 8.4 percent 
[00:48.96]after the market opened in Frankfurt. 
[00:52.16]They fell 9 percent within 25 minutes of trading.  
[00:57.72]Shares of Porsche Automobil Holding SE, 
[01:01.84]a controlling shareholder of VW, fell 8 percent.  
[01:07.80]Volkswagen is Europe's largest automaker.  
[01:12.04]The company did not say which cars were affected, 
[01:15.68]reported the Wall Street Journal. 
[01:18.68]Industry analysts said cars sold in Europe were probably affected.   
[01:25.08]The U.S. government said Monday that VW cheated on emissions tests. 
[01:30.40]The Associated Press reported 
[01:33.00]that VW placed software in about 10,000 cars 
[01:37.92]that reported false levels of pollution.  
[01:41.16]The German automaker installed that device on VW, 
[01:45.52]Porsche, and Audi vehicles. 
[01:49.00]The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
[01:52.24]and California Air Resources Board announced the findings Monday.  
[01:59.48]The cars give off up to nine times more pollution 
[02:03.88]than the amount allowed by the EPA. 
[02:08.08]The EPA is a federal agency that focuses on protecting the environment.  
[02:15.36]The new report is another blow to VW. 
[02:19.20]In September, the German automaker admitted 
[02:22.96]that up to 11 million cars globally could have the misleading devices.  
[02:30.16]Volkswagen has reorganized top executives since the scandal emerged. 
[02:36.72]The company said it contacted government agencies to fix the situation, 
[02:42.40]reported the Wall Street Journal.  
[02:45.44]"Volkswagen would do well to immediately and completely 
[02:49.32]disclose all people and products in this deception,  
[02:53.52]no matter how far-reaching," said Karl Brauer, 
[02:56.84]a senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, 
[02:59.83]a well-known car valuation and research service.   
[03:04.48]Air bag maker Takata's shares also fell Wednesday because of scandals.  
[03:11.84]U.S. regulators fined the company Wednesday 
[03:15.68]for producing defective airbags. 
[03:19.04]Airbags inflate during accidents to protect drivers and passengers.   
[03:25.92]The U.S. National Highway Transportation Safety Administration 
[03:31.08]imposed a $200 million fine 
[03:34.40]on Takata for failing to warn the public 
[03:37.68]and government about the defective airbags. 
[03:41.04]This was the largest civil penalty in the agency's history.   
[03:45.92]Honda Motors, Takata's biggest client,  
[03:49.68]said it would no longer buy airbags from the company, 
[03:53.08]just hours after the announcement.
[03:56.64]Eight people have been killed 
[03:58.80]and more than 100 others injured 
[04:01.72]by airbags that didn't work properly.  
[04:04.60]The airbags exploded instead of inflated during accidents. 
[04:10.28]All the accidents happened in cars made by Honda. 
[04:14.84]The defective airbags caused a recall of millions of cars globally,  
[04:20.53]including 19 million in the U.S.  
[04:24.28]I'm Mary Gotschall.
