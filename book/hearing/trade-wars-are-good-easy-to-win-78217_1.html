<div class="content">President Donald Trump is defending his plan to raise taxes on steel and aluminum imports entering the United States.美国总统川普正在捍卫他对美国进口钢铁和铝材征税的计划。 
<p>Trump declared on Friday that "trade wars are good, and easy to win" -- a claim that some Americans were quick to criticize. The critics include members of his own Republican Party.川普周五宣称，“贸易战是好事，并可以轻易取胜。”一些美国人很快批评了这种说法，其中就包括川普所属共和党的成员。</p>
<p>Trump has said that the U.S. government would set punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Such a move would increase tensions with China and other countries. They also would raise the possibility of higher prices for American businesses and consumers.<br/>川普曾表示，美国政府将对钢铁和铝材进口征收惩罚性关税。此举会加剧美国同中国等国的紧张关系，也增加了美国企业和消费者面临涨价的可能性。</p>
<p>Early Friday, Trump took to the Twitter social networking service to defend himself. He wrote: "When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with...every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!"<br/>周五早些时候，川普在推特网上为自己进行了辩护。他说：“当一个国家（美国）在跟几乎每个与之贸易往来的国家进行贸易时都会蒙受数十亿、数十亿美元损失的时候，贸易战是好事，并可以轻易取胜。”</p>
<p>He later tweeted: "Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!"<br/>他随后又发推文说：“我们的钢铁行业状况不佳。没有钢铁就无以立国。”</p>
<p>His announcement came only after an intense debate among his top aides. It brought strong criticism from some Republicans and financial markets concerned about tariffs and their effect on the economy.<br/>他在宣布之前仅仅只跟他的高级助手进行了激烈辩论。这引发了一些共和党人和金融市场就关税及其对经济影响的强烈批评。</p>
<p>The president asked heads of aluminum and steel companies to the White House Thursday. He announced plans to set tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports next week. He added that the tariffs would remain for "a long period of time."<br/>川普周四邀请铝材和钢铁公司负责人到白宫。他宣布计划下周对进口钢铁征收25%，对铝材进口征收10%的关税。他补充说，这些关税将会维持“很长一段时间。”</p>
<p>The Associated Press says it was not immediately clear if the taxes would affect all trading partners.<br/>美联社表示，目前尚不清楚这些税收是否会影响所有贸易伙伴。</p>
<p>Around the world, Trump's words led to criticism from the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. He rejected the plan as a clear intervention to protect U.S. domestic industry. Juncker said the EU would take steps to punish the U.S. if Trump followed through.<br/>川普的言论引发了欧盟主席让-克洛德·容克（Jean-Claude Juncker）的批评。他称这项计划是为保护美国国内产业所进行的公然干预，他对此表示拒绝。容克表示，如果川普一意孤行，欧盟将会采取措施惩罚美国。</p>
<p>China's Commerce Ministry said it was seriously concerned about Trump's plan. The ministry said China has satisfied its trade agreements and appealed to the U.S. government to settle disputes through negotiation.<br/>中国商务部对川普的计划表示严重关系。该部门表示，中国已经满足了该国签订的贸易协定，并呼吁美国政府通过谈判解决争端。</p>
<p>China has received many complaints from the United States, Europe and other trading partners. They accuse the Chinese government of unfairly supporting Chinese exports and restricting the Chinese market in violation of its free-trade promises.<br/>中国已经受到了美国、欧洲等贸易伙伴的众多投诉。他们指责中国政府不公平地鼓励出口并限制国内市场，违反了该国的自由贸易承诺。</p>
<p>Canada is the largest provider of steel and aluminum imports in the U.S. The Canadian government said it would "take responsive measures" to defend the country's trade interests and workers if the tariffs affected Canadian steel and aluminum products.<br/>加拿大是美国最大的钢铁和铝材供应商。加拿大政府表示，如果关税影响到加拿大的钢铁和铝产品，它就会采取“应对措施”来保护自己的贸易利益和工人。</p>
<p>Critics warned Trump's tariffs may lead to a trade war. They suggested other countries will take action to punish the United States or use national security as a reason to set their own trade rules.<br/>批评者警告称，川普的关税可能会导致贸易战。他们暗示，其它国家将会采取措施惩罚美国，或是以国家安全为由制定自己的贸易规则。</p>
<p>Trump's move will possibly raise steel and aluminum prices in the U.S. That is good news for American companies, but bad for companies that use the metals, such as manufacturers of beer and air conditioning equipment. The American International Automobile Dealers Association said the tariffs could cause the cost of a car to rise a lot.<br/>川普此举可能会推高美国钢铁和铝材的价格。这对美国公司来说是个利好，但是对那些使用钢铁和铝材的公司来说是个利空，例如啤酒和空调设备制造商。美国国际汽车经销商协会表示，这些关税可能会导致汽车成本大幅上涨。</p>
<p>Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official, noted "What benefits one industry can hurt another. What saves one job can jeopardize another." Cutler is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.<br/>美国前贸易官员温迪·卡特勒（Wendy Cutler）指出，“对一个行业有利就会伤害另一个行业。保全一个职位就会危害另一个。”卡特勒现在是亚洲社会政策研究所的副主席。</p>
<p>American companies said steel tariffs announced in 2002 by then President George W. Bush destroyed 200,000 U.S. jobs.<br/>美国公司表示，2002年时任总统小布什公布的钢铁关税毁掉了20万个美国就业岗位。</p>
<p>The new tariffs were requested by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.<br/>美国商务部长威尔伯·罗斯（Wilbur Ross）和白宫贸易顾问彼得·纳瓦罗（Peter Navarro）要求征收这些新的关税。</p>
<p>White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the decision "shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone," saying that the president had been talking about it for many years. Trump has long accused China and others of what he calls unfair trade.<br/>白宫新闻秘书萨拉·赫卡比·桑德斯（Sarah Huckabee Sanders）表示，这一决定“不应该让任何人感到惊讶。”他说川普多年来一直都在讨论这个问题。川普一直指责中国等国不公平贸易。</p>
<p>But some Republicans in Congress were angry.<br/>但是国会的一些共和党人非常愤怒。</p>
<p>Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said the tariffs were a "tax increase on American families." Sasse noted that he would expect Democratic Party lawmakers to set trade tariffs, not Republicans.<br/>内布拉斯加州参议员本·萨斯(Ben Sasse)表示，这些关税是对美国家庭加税。萨斯指出，他希望民主党议员来制定贸易关税，而不是共和党人。</p>
<p>House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, said through a spokesman he hoped Trump would consider the effects of a trade war.<br/>众议院议长、来自威斯康星州的共和党人保罗·瑞安（Paul Ryan）通过发言人表示，他希望川普会考虑到贸易战的影响。</p>

[00:00.12]President Donald Trump is defending his plan to raise taxes
[00:06.12]on steel and aluminum imports entering the United States.
[00:13.60]Trump declared on Friday that "trade wars are good, and easy to win"
[00:21.00]-- a claim that some Americans were quick to criticize.
[00:26.44]The critics include members of his own Republican Party.
[00:33.08]Trump has said that the U.S. government
[00:36.60]would set punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
[00:42.88]Such a move would increase tensions with China and other countries.
[00:49.80]They also would raise the possibility of higher prices
[00:54.48]for American businesses and consumers.

[04:40.08]That is good news for American companies,
