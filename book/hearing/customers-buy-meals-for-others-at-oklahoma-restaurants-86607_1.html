珍妮弗·怀特是去年9月开业的热狗屋的老板。她的店卖热狗，里面放了肉、奶酪和培根等东西。大流行期间她想出了捐赠墙这个想法。她说，不到8个小时，墙上就已经贴满了收据。</p>

热狗屋只有8张桌子，因此不能同时接待太多人用餐。但是在6个月里，顾客们额外购买了600份饭。有些人当时没钱，进来拿收据吃饭，然后又回来买了更多饭让别人吃。还有些人会自己买单后另外再买下10或50份饭。</p>

。
[00:00.04]In the small town of Miami in the central U.S. state of Oklahoma,
[00:06.40]people do not have as much money as they used to.
[00:10.56]Many lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:15.36]Some are even homeless.
[00:18.68]At two restaurants – Zack’s Café and The Dawg House
[00:24.60]– customers are now doing their part to help others.
[00:30.12]When they are ready to pay for their meals,
[00:33.04]they can add another food item.
[00:36.72]On the walls in each restaurant are receipts for the donated meals.
[00:42.20]A receipt is a paper showing what has been purchased.
[00:47.48]Someone who is hungry can come in, choose a receipt,
[00:53.24]sit down and have something to eat.
[00:57.20]Jennifer White owns The Dawg House, which opened last September.
[01:03.36]She sells hot dogs with extra items like meat, cheese, and bacon.
[01:10.80]She started the idea of the giving wall during the pandemic.
[01:15.84]Within eight hours, she said she had a wall filled with receipts.
[01:23.56]The Dawg House only has eight tables,
[01:27.20]so not that many people can visit at one time.
[01:30.96]But in six months, customers have purchased 600 extra meals.
[01:39.16]Some who had no money at the time
[01:42.32]took down the receipts to eat and then returned
[01:47.80]to pay for more meals so someone else could eat.
[01:53.08]Others would buy their own meal and then pay for another 10 or 50.
[02:01.08]“That says a lot about how amazing our community is,” White said.
[02:09.72]Lasay Castellano recently left Zack’s Café to return to school.
[02:17.20]She said the restaurant serves about 600 people a day.
[02:22.68]And she has been putting up the receipts for two months.
[02:28.60]“We have a lot of homeless people here,” she said.
[02:31.68]“We’re having a hard time keeping the receipts on the wall.”
[02:37.32]The town of Miami has not just been hurt by the health crisis.
[02:42.40]Two large snowstorms in February
[02:45.84]forced many people without homes into hotels.
[02:50.76]However, the town is beginning to return to normal activities.
[02:57.24]The area’s casinos have reopened
[03:00.68]and restaurants now welcome people for in-person meals.
[03:06.04]White remembered when two parents
[03:08.12]came in with their children recently.
[03:10.48]She said, “They seemed like they had a lot going on
[03:15.16]and got to sit for an hour and a half or so
[03:18.68]to just have a meal, have fun and laugh,
[03:22.00]and not worry about how much they were having to spend.”
