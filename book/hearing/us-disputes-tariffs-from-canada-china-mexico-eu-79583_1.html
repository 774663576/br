<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:US Disputes Tariffs from Canada, China, Mexico, EU]

。
[00:00.00]The United States has launched five separate dispute actions
[00:05.38]at the World Trade Organization against Canada,
[00:09.27]China, the European Union, Mexico and Turkey.
[00:15.35]The U.S. says these countries wrongly placed tariffs on U.S. products.
[00:24.31]The tariffs would involve a combined $28.5 billion worth of U.S. exports.
[00:35.36]They were ordered in reaction to U.S. tariffs announced in March.
[00:42.24]However, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer says
[00:48.27]the latest tariffs are illegal under WTO rules.
[00:54.51]The Trump administration has said American national security interests
[01:00.21]justified tariffs it placed on imported aluminum and steel products.
[01:08.38]It said the tariffs are meant to protect the U.S. steel
[01:13.69]and aluminum industries from low-cost imports from other countries.
[01:20.32]But the administration argues the tariffs put in place
[01:26.20]by the four countries and the EU are not permitted
[01:30.77]because they are not based on national security.
[01:35.45]Under WTO rules, countries decide what their national security interests are.
[01:43.88]But the group also dissuades countries from overuse of that justification to avoid abuses.
[01:54.10]Lighthizer said, "Instead of working with us to address a common problem,
[02:01.54]some of our trading partners have elected to respond
[02:05.83]with retaliatory tariffs designed to punish American workers, farmers and companies."
[02:15.23]The World Trade Organization describes itself
[02:20.48]as the "only global international organization dealing with trade between nations."
[02:29.13]There are trade agreements between countries or groups of countries
[02:35.37]that also set rules for international trade.
[02:40.47]These include the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
[02:47.47]But WTO officials point out that these agreements are not designed
[02:54.21]to deal with big issues that affect many countries or individual industries across borders.
[03:04.18]The WTO was established in 1995 following years of negotiations.
[03:13.90]The talks began at the end of World War Two and involved more than one hundred countries.
[03:22.34]The group has added more large economies in recent years
[03:28.58]including China in 2001, Vietnam in 2007 and Russia in 2012.
[03:40.10]The body, which is based in Geneva, has a General Council that includes all its members.
[03:49.92]The Council carries out the business of negotiating,
[03:54.81]observing trade conditions and settling disputes among members in addition to other activities.
[04:04.79]Below the General Council are many committees that specialize
[04:11.24]in the complex issues of trade in goods, services and intellectual property.
[04:19.86]Decisions in the WTO are "generally made by consensus,"
[04:27.15]meaning all members must agree. And, all members have an equal vote.
[04:35.87]The latest disputes over U.S. tariffs have set off measures
[04:42.82]and counter-measures by the countries including China, the EU and Canada.
[04:52.75]Mexico is one of the countries the U.S. has included in its WTO dispute action.
[05:01.32]Mexico's economy minister said the country would defend itself
[05:08.11]in the trade body against the latest U.S. actions.
[05:13.73]The ministry said in a statement, "U.S. purchases of Mexican steel and aluminum
[05:22.16]do not represent a national security threat to that country."
[05:28.30]On Monday, the International Monetary Fund warned
[05:34.57]that growing trade conflicts could harm the world's economic recovery.
[05:41.39]The IMF continues to predict world economic growth will reach 3.9 percent in 2019.
[05:53.35]But it warned, "The risk of worse outcomes has increased."
[06:00.09]Maurice Obstfeld is the chief economist for the IMF.
[06:08.27]He said the tariffs make the U.S. a target of trade actions if trade disputes continue to expand.
[06:19.63]"The United States finds a relatively high share of its exports taxed
[06:27.05]in global markets in such a broader trade conflict," he said.
