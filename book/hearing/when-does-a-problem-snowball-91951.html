。
[00:07.84]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.68]from VOA Learning English.
[00:18.60]If you live in a part of the world
[00:21.36]that is experiencing winter right now,
[00:24.12]it might be snowing.
[00:26.76]But even if you do not live in a snowy climate,
[00:30.88]try to image cold, snowy weather.
[00:35.08]Imagine having a snowball fight with your friends.
[00:39.72]A snowball is, of course, a ball of snow.
[00:44.80]But not all snow makes good snowballs.
[00:49.36]If the snow is too light and dry,
[00:52.20]it will not hold together.
[00:54.68]It is powdery.
[00:57.96]Wetter snow makes for great snowballs.
[01:01.32]You can pack it into a tight ball,
[01:04.72]which is great for throwing.
[01:08.72]A snowball might hurt a bit,
[01:11.32]but it would not cause a lot of damage.
[01:15.60]But imagine that snowball rolling down a hill.
[01:19.88]As it rolls, it picks up more and more snow.
[01:24.88]It gets bigger and bigger
[01:27.48]until it crashes into something and causes damage!
[01:32.96]And that gives us "snowball" as a verb.
[01:38.48]Dictionary.com defines the verb "snowball"
[01:42.44]as becoming "larger, greater,
[01:45.72]more intense…" very quickly.
[01:49.80]If something like a project, campaign,
[01:53.28]or business snowballs,
[01:56.08]its progress rapidly increases and grows.
[02:00.88]For example, after a photographer
[02:03.88]posted a picture on Instagram
[02:06.44]of a monkey protecting a human baby,
[02:09.80]her followers snowballed
[02:12.28]to over 1 million within a week!
[02:17.00]However, when we use this expression
[02:20.04]the ending results are usually not good.
[02:24.68]Something that snowballs in a bad way
[02:27.80]goes downhill quickly.
[02:30.96]For example,
[02:32.28]when we do not take care of small problems,
[02:35.36]they can snowball into bigger ones.
[02:39.60]Now, let's hear an example
[02:41.84]using the verb "snowball."
[02:45.04]A: I have a friend who lied
[02:46.56]about knowing sign language on her resume.
[02:49.40]She thought no one would ask her
[02:51.20]to actually prove she knew sign language.
[02:53.76]But her boss asked her to.
[02:56.24]In fact, he set up a big meeting with the deaf community
[03:00.04]and assigned her to act as translator.
[03:02.76]She lied about why she could not attend the event.
[03:05.76]But her boss surprised her with an unplanned meeting.
[03:09.32]That is when he found out that she did not know how to sign.
[03:13.08]Her lie on her resume quickly snowballed
[03:15.88]into a workplace drama that got her fired from her job.
[03:19.64]Next, let's talk about the expression snowball effect.
[03:25.44]A snowball effect is a situation
[03:29.04]where one action or event causes
[03:32.52]many other similar actions or events.
[03:36.80]And these actions or events grow and grow
[03:40.48]bigger and more problematic
[03:43.28]– just like a snowball rolling down a hill.
[03:47.80]A snowball effect is similar to a chain of events.
[03:52.60]However, with a chain of events,
[03:55.80]one thing leads to another.
[03:58.24]But these events do not necessarily
[04:01.44]intensify or grow bigger.
[04:05.64]And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories.
[04:08.92]Hopefully, using resources on VOA Learning English
[04:14.24]is having a snowball effect
[04:17.00]on your English studies … in a good way!
[04:21.04]Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.
