[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English,
[00:02.29]this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.19]Elections in Greece on Sunday
[00:08.37]put politician Alexis Tsipras and his Syriza party
[00:13.29]in power in the heavily indebted country.
[00:16.93]Prime Minister Tsipras gained popularity
[00:20.76]by promising to end austerity policies.
[00:24.74]Those are measures to shrink the government budget and reduce spending.
[00:30.63]Mr. Tsipras has said he will renegotiate the terms of loans
[00:36.18]from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
[00:41.06]They offered Greece $268 billion in assistance in 2010 and 2011
[00:49.97]to help prevent a financial disaster in the country.
[00:54.53]E.U. finance ministers have suggested giving Greece,
[00:59.58]an EU member, more time to pay back its loans.
[01:04.92]However, there is little support for cancelling any of the debt.
[01:10.04]Dionyssis Dimitrakopoulos is a political expert
[01:15.58]at the University of London.
[01:17.49]He says E.U. members know
[01:20.56]that they are not getting the results they wanted
[01:23.77]from Greece's austerity program.
[01:27.32]"Institutions of the E.U. and other member states
[01:29.34]realize that the program that has been implemented in Greece
[01:33.13]is not producing the desired results to the extent that they wanted.
[01:36.56]So something has to change.
[01:38.68]In my book this is common ground for negotiation."
[01:42.90]Mr. Tsipras has tried to show that he means to change Greek politics.
[01:48.87]For example, he did not include a religious act
[01:52.91]at his swearing-in ceremony.
[01:55.18]Greek Orthodox officials traditionally give a blessing.
[01:59.72]The new leader's Syriza party
[02:03.44]joined with the right-wing Independent Greeks Party
[02:06.76]to form a ruling coalition in parliament.
[02:10.90]Both parties want to change the terms of Greece's loan deal.
[02:16.05]But, they agree on little else.
[02:18.73]E.U. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters
[02:26.04]that EU officials would have to look at the demands of the new Greek government.
[02:32.01]But, he also said that the E.U. rules were established
[02:37.50]through a common agreement with Greek officials.
[02:41.35]Germany, Europe's largest economy,
[02:44.88]is considered the strongest supporter of austerity measures.
[02:49.93]Government officials have stated that it may be better for Greece
[02:54.94]to stop using the euro as its currency.
[02:58.57]However, expert Dionyssis Dimitrakopoulos says
[03:03.15]the cost of Greece leaving the euro zone may be too high.
[03:07.69]"It is in nobody's interests,
[03:09.84]and that concerns not only Greece but also Germany, France and so on,
[03:13.99]for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone.
[03:17.06]Because the next question will be,
[03:18.90]‘who will be the next country to withdraw?'"
[03:21.46]Whether Greece will stay in the Eurozone
[03:24.38]is not the only question E.U. officials might face.
[03:28.84]British Prime Minister David Cameron has said
[03:32.72]he would seek to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the E.U.
[03:37.65]if his Conservative Party wins elections in May.
[03:42.69]And that's the Economics Report from VOA Learning English.
[03:48.96]I'm Mario Ritter.
