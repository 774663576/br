<p>Every day Juanita Mengel, a 67-year-old woman from the state of Ohio, wakes up and puts on her manufactured leg. The device is called a prosthetic.</p>
<p>Then, Mengel does the same for Lola-Pearl, her colorful five-year-old cat. Lola-Pearl is missing her back left leg.</p>
<p>Mengel has many cats. Most of them have disabilities. But Lola-Pearl is special. She is a <strong>therapy</strong> cat. And, she and Mengel are partners of a kind. They are among 200 therapy cat teams registered in the United States by the nonprofit group, Pet Partners.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image taken from video shows kitten Lola-Pearl looking up at attendees during a Amputees Coming Together Informing Others' Needs meeting on Monday, Dec. 11, 2023, in Troy, Ohio.

<p>The group helps humans and pets alike by setting them up into teams to provide animal-assisted intervention. The teams visit hospitals, nursing homes and schools and assist those in need.</p>
<p>Taylor Chastain Griffin is national director of animal-assisted interventions at Pet Partners. She said, "A therapy animal is an animal who's been <strong>assessed</strong> based on their ability to meet new people and not just <strong>tolerate</strong> the interaction, but actively enjoy it."</p>
<p>Chastain Griffin is a researcher who studies the effects of therapy cats. She said there needs to be more research done in cat therapy. She said that there is a lot of research on other therapy animals like dogs, and many people are surprised to learn that cats can be therapy animals too.</p>
<p>"They go into a setting and people are like, 'Whoa, there's a cat on a <strong>leash</strong>. What's happening? It kind of <strong>inspires</strong> people to connect in a way we haven't traditionally heard talked about in other therapy animal interventions," Chastain Griffin said.</p>
<p>Besides dogs and cats, Pet Partners registers seven other species as therapy animals, including horses, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, birds, mini pigs, and llamas and alpacas.</p>
<p>Mengel said Lola-Pearl showed signs that she would make a good therapy cat soon after the animal joined her family. Mengel took her new cat to a meeting for <strong>amputees</strong>.</p>
<p>"She was so good with people I just knew she would be a good therapy cat. People really were attracted to her, too," Mengel said.</p>
<p>Recently people who attended a support group for amputees were able to meet Lola-Pearl. They petted her as she woke up from a rest. On the side of the cat carrier she rode in was a sign: "Therapy Cat" it read.</p>
<p>Mengel was a traveling nurse when she was in a car accident that almost killed her. One of her legs could not be saved.</p>
<p>Later, she connected with a friend in the state of Missouri who had a severely injured kitten. Her legs were <strong>twisted</strong> together. An animal medical specialist worked to repair the damage but, in the end, they had to remove one of the baby cat's legs.</p>
<p>That kitten was Lola-Pearl.</p>
<p>Mengel took Lola-Pearl as her cat after talking with her friend. Despite the difficulties Mengel has faced, she is thankful for Lola-Pearl and their work together.</p>
<p>"It's a really rewarding experience," she said, "I get just as much out of it as the people that I visit."</p>
