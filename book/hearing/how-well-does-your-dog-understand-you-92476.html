。
[00:00.04]Dog owners know that their dogs understand
[00:04.56]and answer commands such as "sit" and "stay."
[00:08.64]Many believe that dogs also understand words connected
[00:13.48]to their favorite objects.
[00:15.72]"Bring me your ball" will often result in exactly that.
[00:20.40]But science has had trouble determining
[00:23.40]whether dogs and other animals
[00:25.76]truly create a mental image in their minds
[00:29.56]when they hear the name of an object.
[00:32.96]Such an action would suggest
[00:34.92]a deeper understanding of language,
[00:37.84]like the kind that humans have.
[00:41.20]A new study in Hungary
[00:43.40]has found that beyond being able to
[00:46.24]answer commands like "roll over,"
[00:49.00]dogs can learn to link words with exact objects.
[00:54.04]This is a relationship with language
[00:57.44]called referential understanding
[01:00.16]that has been unproven in dogs.
[01:03.88]"When we are talking about objects,
[01:06.72]objects are external to the dogs,
[01:10.08]and dogs have to learn that words refer,
[01:13.28]they stand for something that is external to them,"
[01:17.00]said Marianna Boros.
[01:19.52]She is a co-lead writer of the study.
[01:23.32]The study, which has been peer-reviewed,
[01:27.16]appeared recently in the science publication
[01:30.40]called Current Biology.
[01:32.72]It involved 18 dogs
[01:35.88]and a non-invasive EEG procedure
[01:39.56]using electrodes attached to dogs' heads
[01:43.52]to measure brain activity and record brain waves.
[01:47.84]Dog owners participating in the study
[01:51.16]would play an audio clip
[01:53.12]in which they said the name of their dog's toy —
[01:56.60]like "ball" or "frisbee" —
[01:58.76]and then they would show the dog an object.
[02:02.40]The researchers measured the dogs' brain activity
[02:06.24]when the object in the recording matched
[02:09.24]the object that was displayed
[02:11.48]and also when it differed.
[02:14.04]"We expected that if a dog really understands
[02:17.84]the meaning of the object's word,
[02:20.20]it will expect to see that object.
[02:23.48]And if the owner shows a different one,
[02:26.56]there will be a so-called
[02:28.44]surprise reaction in the brain," Boros said.
[02:32.76]She added, "and this is exactly what we found."
[02:37.72]The study found a different brain pattern
[02:40.52]when the dogs were shown an object
[02:42.92]that matched the word compared to when it did not.
[02:46.96]The finding suggests the animals created
[02:50.60]a mental image of an object
[02:52.84]based on hearing the word for it.
[02:55.36]Lilla Magyari, also a co-lead writer of the study,
[03:00.96]said that while other animals
[03:03.36]have been shown to have some degree
[03:06.00]of referential understanding of language,
[03:09.04]those animals have usually been highly trained to do so.
[03:14.00]In dogs, she said, the findings
[03:17.60]show that such abilities appear to be inborn
[03:21.76]and require no special training or talent.
[03:25.52]The study supports ideas about "language evolution
[03:29.56]which actually say that referential understanding
[03:33.32]is not necessarily unique to humans," added Magyari.
[03:38.20]While the study has received praise,
[03:41.52]some experts have expressed doubt about its findings.
[03:46.16]Clive Wynne of Arizona State University
[03:49.72]said in a post on Facebook
[03:52.08]that he believes that all the study shows
[03:55.24]is that dogs respond to stimuli.
[03:58.76]Wynne does not believe the dogs
[04:01.04]understand the meaning of exact words.
[04:04.64]Scientists believe the first dogs
[04:07.40]began to be kept by humans up to 30,000 years ago.
[04:12.20]The animals have lived closely alongside us ever since.
[04:17.20]But whether dogs gain the ability
[04:19.80]to understand referential language
[04:22.20]during that evolution remains unclear.
