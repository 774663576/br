<p>He added that the experiment is designed to demonstrate the abilities of wood to serve as a suitable material for developing future space equipment.</p>
<p>"Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood," said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. "A wooden satellite should be <strong>feasible</strong>, too." Murata noted that wood can last longer in space than on Earth because water or oxygen cannot burn or destroy it.</p>

[00:00.04]An experimental satellite
[00:02.76]made out of wood
[00:04.68]has been launched into space.
[00:07.88]Japanese developers of the device
[00:11.56]say it is the first time
[00:14.36]a wooden satellite
[00:15.96]has ever been sent to space.
[00:19.08]The small satellite, called LignoSat,
[00:23.72]launched aboard an uncrewed Cargo Dragon spacecraft
[00:28.56]to the International Space Station (ISS).
[00:33.56]The satellite will later be released into orbit
[00:37.84]about 400 kilometers above Earth.
[00:42.00]The satellite was built in the form of a box,
[00:46.92]with each side measuring about 10 centimeters.
[00:51.64]It was developed jointly by researchers
[00:56.04]at Kyoto University
[00:58.28]and Japanese homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry.
[01:03.52]A spokeswoman for Sumitomo Forestry
[01:07.96]told the French news agency AFP

[01:16.36]She said the plan calls for the device
[01:20.48]to be released into orbit in about a month,
[01:24.32]when its strength and effectiveness will be tested.
[01:30.24]While made mostly of wood,
[01:32.76]LignoSat contains electronic elements

[01:39.20]and collect data on its operation.
[01:42.84]Once deployed, the satellite is expected

[02:46.48]Such objects can present threats

[02:55.60]Takao Doi is an astronaut
[02:58.52]who has flown on past space missions
[03:01.84]and studies human space activities
[03:05.40]at Kyoto University.
[03:07.84]He told Reuters he thinks wood
[03:11.44]can greatly improve future stays
[03:14.88]for long-term space travelers.
[03:18.36]"With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves,
[03:23.60]we will be able to build houses,
[03:26.48]live and work in space forever," Doi said.
[03:32.32]He added that the experiment is designed
[03:36.08]to demonstrate the abilities of wood
[03:39.36]to serve as a suitable material
[03:42.44]for developing future space equipment.
