[00:00.96]For many book writers,
[00:02.84]artificial intelligence (AI)
[00:06.80]is a threat to their jobs
[00:09.28]and the very idea of creativity.
[00:13.52]More than 10,000 writers and others
[00:16.88]supported an open letter about the issue
[00:20.48]from the Authors Guild this summer.
[00:23.96]The letter urged AI companies
[00:26.68]not to use copyrighted work
[00:29.20]without permission or payment.
[00:32.52]At the same time, AI is a story to tell,
[00:36.92]and no longer just in science fiction.
[00:41.20]Helen Phillips is the writer
[00:43.64]of the upcoming book HUM.
[00:46.48]It tells of a wife and mother
[00:49.24]who loses her job to AI.
[00:53.08]"I'm frightened by artificial intelligence,"
[00:56.16]but also interested in it, she explained.
[01:00.44]Phillips said there is a hope in AI
[01:03.24]for gaining all knowledge,
[01:05.28]the understanding of everything.
[01:07.96]But at the same time,
[01:09.60]there is an "inherent terror
[01:12.40]in being replaced by non-human intelligence."
[01:17.32]Ryan Doherty is a vice president
[01:20.28]and director at Celadon Books.
[01:24.32]It recently agreed to publish Fred Lunzker's book Sike,
[01:29.36]featuring an AI psychiatrist,
[01:32.20]a doctor of mental health.
[01:35.32]"We've been seeing more and more about AI
[01:38.84]in book proposals," Doherty said.
[01:42.88]Doherty used the term zeitgeist,
[01:45.88]meaning the general ideas or spirit of a time,
[01:50.00]to describe AI.
[01:52.56]"It's the zeitgeist right now.
[01:55.16]And whatever is in the cultural zeitgeist"
[01:58.92]gets into fiction, Doherty said.
[02:02.92]Other AI-related books expected in the next two years
[02:07.76]include Sean Michaels' Do You Remember Being Born?.
[02:13.08]That story tells of a poet who agrees
[02:16.12]to work with an AI poetry company.
[02:20.12]Also upcoming is In Our Likeness,
[02:23.40]by Bryan Van Dyke.
[02:26.12]It tells about a government worker
[02:28.96]and a fact-checking program
[02:31.68]with the power to change facts.
[02:35.32]Another novel, A.E. Osworth's Awakened,
[02:39.64]tells about a witch and her clash with AI.
[02:44.36]And, crime fiction writer Jeffrey Siger,
[02:48.12]known for his books set in modern Greece,
[02:51.64]is working on a book touching upon AI
[02:55.28]and the metaverse.

[03:33.88]Amy Shearn's book, Animal Instinct,
[03:37.20]has its beginnings in the pandemic
[03:40.44]and in her personal life.
[03:43.40]She had recently divorced

[03:48.56]"It's so weird how, with apps,
[03:51.08]you start to feel as if you're going

[03:56.08]"And I thought, wouldn't it be great
