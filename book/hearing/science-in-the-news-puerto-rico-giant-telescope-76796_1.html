<p>Many of the observatory's instruments appear to be unharmed. Arecibo Deputy Director Joan Schmelz called that "a thing to be thankful for" in an interview with the Associated Press.<br/>该天文台的很多仪器似乎都没有遭到破坏。阿雷西博天文台副台长Joan Schmelz在接受美联社采访时称这要“谢天谢地。”</p>
<p>But a large antenna used to study the Earth's upper atmosphere broke during the storm, the AP reported. Damage to the observatory is estimated to be in the millions of dollars.<br/>但是美联社报道称，用于研究地球上空大气层的一种大型天线在飓风期间损坏了。天文台的损失估计有数百万美元。</p>
<p>The observatory is home to the Arecibo radio telescope, a 305-meter- wide dish. It collects radio waves and focuses them onto scientific instruments that measure and process them. The instruments are suspended above the dish on towers over 80 meters high.<br/>该天文台是305米口径的阿雷西博射电望远镜的所在地。它能收集无线电波，并将它们集中到用于测量和处理该电波的科学仪器上。这些仪器悬挂在射电望远镜上方80多米高的塔上。</p>
<p>During the storm, a small group of researchers remained at the observatory. They stayed in its concrete buildings. They had some food and water, but, like most in Puerto Rico, were cut off from the rest of the world.<br/>在这场飓风中有一小波研究人员驻守在天文台。他们住在天文台的混凝土建筑物内。他们有一些食物和水，但是像波多黎各大部分地区一样，与世界上其它地方失去了联系。</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the first people that the researchers were able to contact after the storm were amateur radio operators.<br/>也许不足为奇的是，研究人员在飓风之后最先能够联系到的是业余无线电操作人员。</p>
<p><strong>Storm costs could threaten future operations<br/>飓风损失可能会威胁到未来继续运营</strong></p>

Arecibo could face closure if money cannot be found to repair it and to continue operations.<br/>资金限制以及建造运营更新型望远镜的意愿使得美国国家科学基金会考虑削减对旧的望远镜的支持。如果找不到用于维修和继续运营的资金，阿雷西博天文台可能会面临关闭。</p>

Radar can be used to study conditions in the Earth's atmosphere and detect asteroids that pass dangerously close to Earth.<br/>该望远镜可用于研究太空无线电信号。它也可以像雷达一样发射无线电波。雷达可用于研究地球大气层状况，并检测危险靠近地球的小行星。</p>

<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Hurricane Maria Hit Puerto Rico’s Giant Telescope]
[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.12]Hurricane Maria severely damaged Puerto Rico's electricity and communications systems.
[00:08.84]Millions of people there are without power, water or food.
[00:15.68]The storm also caused damage to a well-known scientific tool
[00:21.12]in the U.S. territory – the Arecibo Observatory.
[00:27.76]Until last year, it was the largest single telescope of its kind in the world.
[00:36.20]Many of the observatory's instruments appear to be unharmed.
[00:42.20]Arecibo Deputy Director Joan Schmelz called that "a thing to be thankful for"
[00:49.84]in an interview with the Associated Press.
[00:54.52]But a large antenna used to study the Earth's upper atmosphere
[00:59.72]broke during the storm, the AP reported.
[01:04.28]Damage to the observatory is estimated to be in the millions of dollars.
[01:11.52]The observatory is home to the Arecibo radio telescope,
[01:17.52]a 305-meter- wide dish.
[01:21.84]It collects radio waves and focuses them
[01:25.92]onto scientific instruments that measure and process them.
[01:31.96]The instruments are suspended above the dish on towers over 80 meters high.
[01:40.88]During the storm, a small group of researchers remained at the observatory.
[01:47.44]They stayed in its concrete buildings.
[01:51.16]They had some food and water, but, like most in Puerto Rico,
[01:56.48]were cut off from the rest of the world.
[02:00.68]Perhaps not surprisingly, the first people that the researchers were able
[02:06.25]to contact after the storm were amateur radio operators.
[02:12.92]The storm damage threatens the telescope's future in several ways.
[02:19.28]It is supported by the National Science Foundation,
[02:23.24]or NSF, in Alexandria, Virginia, as well as the U.S. space agency, NASA.
[02:30.85]Funding limitations and the desire to build and operate newer telescopes
[02:38.16]has made the NSF think about cutting its support for older telescopes.
[02:45.72]Arecibo could face closure if money cannot be found to repair it and to continue operations.
[02:55.16]The Arecibo radio telescope has been involved in well-known scientific research
[03:02.48]since first being used in the 1960s.
[03:07.44]It was used to find an unusual kind of star system,
[03:12.04]a binary pulsar, in 1967.
[03:17.40]The discovery received a Nobel Prize in 1974.
[03:24.44]The telescope can be used to study radio signals coming from space.
[03:31.16]It also can send out radio waves as radar.
[03:36.64]Radar can be used to study conditions in the Earth's atmosphere
[03:42.08]and detect asteroids that pass dangerously close to Earth.
[03:48.76]The huge dish was also part of the SETI project,
[03:53.56]an effort to search for signs of extraterrestrial life.
[03:59.64]The Arecibo telescope was surpassed in size last July
[04:05.60]by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope in Guizhou, China.
[04:13.44]Hurricane Maria, a category four storm,
[04:17.56]left most of Puerto Rico's 3.4 million U.S. citizens
[04:23.08]without power or basic necessities.
[04:27.40]Telephone communications were nearly wiped out,
[04:31.20]as the storm destroyed cell phone towers.
[04:35.88]The observatory is expected to be closed for some time because of the damage.
[04:43.16]Scientists may be able to carry out some kinds of observations soon,
[04:50.00]but others will not be possible for a long time.
[04:55.24]James Ulvestad is acting director for NSF's math and physics directorate.
[05:03.64]He said research, like bouncing radar off of other planets,
[05:09.32]requires a lot of power from the island's electricity grid,
[05:14.60]which was severely damaged by the hurricane.
[05:19.56]The recovery response has been slow,
[05:22.84]as supplies need to be flown in or shipped to the island.
[05:29.24]President Donald Trump has promised the island aid.
[05:34.12]Damage is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.
[05:39.60]Meanwhile, workers with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
[05:45.12]are trying to set up aid centers across the U.S. territory.
[05:51.96]Puerto Rico's government is also burdened
[05:55.24]by tens of billions of dollars in debt that it is unable to pay.
[06:01.84]The island is seeking protection from its creditors
[06:05.80]in the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history.
[06:11.32]I'm Mario Ritter.
