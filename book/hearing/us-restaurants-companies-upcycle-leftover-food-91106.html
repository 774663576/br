<p>Malek's ice cream company is among those at the start of a movement called upcycling. It is a process of creating high-quality products from leftover food.</p>

<p>The organization approved 30 food products in 2021 to carry the seal. But now, 450 different products have received the marker.</p>
<p>Angie Crone is the organization's chief executive. She said outdated guidelines led to a lot of wasted and uneaten food. Crone added, "So this is a mark that you can see on the products wherever you go <strong>shopping</strong>, to be able to understand how that company is reducing food waste..."</p>
<p>The organization's marker is also found on all products made by Renewal Mill. The Oakland, California-based company is turning leftover food products from plant-based milk into food products like flour to reduce waste at the manufacturing level.</p>
<p>Caroline Cotto, the company's founder said, "And then we use that flour to make things like baking mixes and ready-to-eat cookies." Its flour is also used in Salt &amp; Straw's new "Salted Caramel &amp; Okara Cupcakes" ice cream.</p>
<p>The movement is not limited to recycled products found in ice cream stores, farmers' markets, or natural food stores. In San Francisco, a restaurant is now serving pizza and wine with upcycled food such as ugly mushrooms and discolored tomatoes.</p>

[00:00.04]Tyler Malek is the head ice cream maker
[00:03.72]at the Portland, Oregon-based Salt &amp; Straw.
[00:08.56]He uses leftover yogurt to make his lemon curd ice cream.
[00:14.88]For chocolate barley milk, he mixes leftovers of rice and grains
[00:20.72]used to make beer to give it a creamy taste.
[00:25.72]"Instead of calling this food waste, we need to call it wasted food

[01:03.80]The Upcycled Food Association
[01:06.72]said more than 31 million metric tons of food
[01:11.60]are wasted every year in the U.S.
[01:15.64]The organization estimated that waste makes up about
[01:20.00]40 percent of the country's food production,

[01:29.60]Upcycled food is becoming increasingly common in food products
[01:34.28]like cake mixes and veggie chips at natural food stores.
[01:40.52]Others include fruits and vegetables
[01:43.48]that are rejected by restaurants and food stores
[01:47.00]because of their shape or color.
[01:50.24]The Upcycled Food Association

[02:10.60]The organization approved 30 food products in 2021 to carry the seal.
