<p>In the Japanese town of Kojima, the main road is named Jeans Street.</p>
<p>This street is where people from around the world come to visit. The drink machines at the train station have images of <strong>jeans </strong>on them. The roads are painted blue, with the lines at the edges colored pink and white, the<strong> trademark </strong>of Kojima jeans' <strong>seams</strong>.</p>
<p>With about 40 jeans manufacturers and stores, including cafes, the area gets about 100,000 visitors a year, the Japan National Tourism Organization said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Shigeru Uchida, a weaver at Momotaro Jeans, holds a wooden shuttle next to a vintage loom machine in Kojima, Okayama prefecture, Japan, on Sept. 4, 2024.

<p>Japanese jeans are often costly, dark and <strong>durable</strong>. Although a small part of the global jeans market, Japanese jean makers have developed a <strong>reputation</strong> for quality and attention to detail.</p>
<p>Kojima is where popular <strong>brands </strong>like Big John are made. The city now supplies international clothing brands, including Gucci.</p>
<p>Emma McClendon of St. John's University in New York said that the Japanese industry has not taken a mass marketing path. Instead, the jean industry pays careful attention to creating quality products that collectors might like.</p>
<p>In Kojima, Jeans Street is small and uncrowded. Each company in the area is small, hiring about 100 people.</p>
<p>What you will find are workers taking pride in “monozukuri,” or “making things.” The term suggests careful attention to detail.</p>
<p>This idea can be found throughout Japan, from carmakers to the local tofu store.</p>
<p>“More like making a <strong>kimono</strong>” is the way Yoshiharu Okamoto, a <strong>dyeing craftsman</strong> at Kojima-based manufacturer Momotaro Jeans, puts it.</p>
<p>His hands and nails are colored blue from putting threads of cotton into a big container of coloring called dye.</p>
<p>He knows by smell and feel the right state of the indigo coloring, which he compares to a living thing. He says it is a 365-days-a-year job, as the dye has to be checked and mixed every day.</p>
<p>“It's not that easy to get this special color,” Okamoto told the Associated Press recently. “It's my life.”</p>
<p>The dark color is so special it has earned the name “Japan blue" or “tokuno blue,” meaning “especially <strong>concentrated</strong> blue.”</p>
<p>Jeans made in Kojima are costly. The jeans can cost from $230 per pair to $1,400 or more.</p>
<p>Thomas Stege Bojer is founder of Denimhunters, an online site for people who like jeans and the cotton material they are made out of — denim.</p>
<p>He says Japanese brands use “raw denim” that ages well and lasts a long time. He pointed to the jeans as part of a movement known as “slow clothing."</p>
<p>The idea is to produce fewer, but higher quality pieces of clothing. The movement came as a reaction to low-cost, mass-produced clothes.</p>
<p>“We just make too many clothes...I think, and we need to slow down,” Bojer said from his home near Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>McClendon said the Japanese industry is “shifting the <strong>conversation</strong> around jeans to be about <strong>heritage</strong> elements, about educating consumers on historical details as a form of quality.”</p>
<p>Momotaro Jeans, for example, come with a lifetime guarantee. Tears and other problems get fixed at no cost, within reason.</p>
<p>Japan Blue Co., which runs Momotaro, a brand that began in 2006, said yearly sales totaled about $11 million for the latest year. About 40 percent of sales come from outside Japan.</p>
<p>Masataka Suzuki, president and chief operating officer at Japan Blue, said the area has a strong industrial history.</p>
<p>In the past, industry centered around sewing heavy materials, including military clothes and obi sashes for kimonos, as well as the cotton and indigo-dyeing native to the area.</p>
<p>The jeans are for life, Suzuki said. The jeans slowly change depending on how they are worn and how the wearer lives.</p>
<p>“We want to create a product that is a<strong> testament</strong> to a person's life,” he said.</p>
