6月24日，佛罗里达州迈阿密附近的大楼发生倒塌，目前幸存者搜救工作仍在继续。这栋12层高的大楼发生部分倒塌，造成至少11人死亡。还有150人失踪。
<p>As each day passes, the chance of finding people alive in the building known as Champlain Towers South decreases.
随着时间一天天过去，在这栋名为尚普兰南塔楼的大楼中找到存活者的机会越来越小。</p>
<p>Now people who live nearby in Champlain Towers North are wondering if they should leave. North was built in 1982, one year after South, by the same company, using the same materials and a similar design. Just one block away, the nearly 40-year-old building has also faced the same seawater and salty air as South.<br/>
现在尚普兰北塔楼的居民正在考虑是否撤离。北塔楼由同一家公司在1982年使用了相同的材料和类似设计建造，只比南塔楼晚了1年。就在一个街区之外的这栋有着近40年历史的大楼也面临着跟南塔楼一样的海水和咸味空气。</p>
<p>Some who live in Champlain Towers North feel their building is safer than the South building. They say their building does not have the same structural problems that were described in the South's 2018 engineering reports. The report says the South building had "major structural damage" and needed extensive repairs.<br/>
一些尚普兰北塔楼的居民认为他们这栋大楼比南塔楼更加安全。他们说，这栋大楼没有出现南塔楼在2018年工程报告中所描述的结构问题。这份报告称南塔楼存在重大结构性损坏，需要进行大修。</p>
<p>Charles Burkett is the mayor of Surfside, the town that is home to the two buildings. He said a quick inspection of the North building done after the South's collapse did not show any problems. But that did not make everyone feel safe.<br/>
查尔斯·伯克特是两栋大楼所在的瑟夫赛德镇的镇长。他说，南塔楼倒塌后，对北塔楼进行了快速检测，没有发现任何问题。但这并未让每个人都感到安全。</p>
<p>Rebecca Weinstock owns an apartment in Champlain Towers North. She was in New York when South fell. "I'm petrified of returning," she said.<br/>
丽贝卡·温斯托克在尚普兰北塔楼有一套公寓。南塔楼倒塌时，她正在纽约。她说：“我害怕回去。”</p>
<p>Weinstock said she will only return if two independent building engineers, not from Florida, agree the building is safe.<br/>
温斯托克表示，只有在有两名非佛罗里达州的独立建筑工程师认为这栋大楼是安全的情况下，她才会回来。</p>
<p>Philip and Nora Zyne said about 25 percent of North residents have left the building, but they are staying in their fifth-floor apartment. "I'm not worried at all right now," Philip Zyne said. But he added that he wants a full engineering and scientific review of the building.<br/>
菲利普·泽恩和诺拉·泽恩表示，大约25%的北塔楼居民已经离开了这栋大楼，但是他们仍然住在他们位于5楼的公寓里。菲利普表示：“我现在一点都不担心。”但是他也表示，希望对这栋大楼进行全面的工程和科学审查。</p>
<p>Most residents of the North tower also told the Associated Press that they want a full inspection, but they are not leaving. And the United States government is offering temporary housing aid to residents of the North building who choose to leave.<br/>
北塔楼的大部分居民也对美联社表示，他们希望进行全面检测，但是他们不会离开。美国政府将为选择离开北塔楼的居民提供临时住房援助。</p>
<p>Salomon Gold has been one of the leaders of the building's resident organization for 20 years. He said he and the others always worked to keep the building safe. He compared the two buildings to two similar airplanes made by the same company. He said just because one crashes does not mean the other will. "We are in good shape," Gold said.<br/>
萨洛蒙·古德这20年来一直都是该大楼的居民组织的领导者之一。他说他和其他人一直在努力确保这栋大楼的安全。他将这两栋大楼跟由同一家公司制造的两架类似飞机进行了比较。他说，只因为一栋楼倒塌并不意味着另一栋也会倒塌。”古德表示：“我们这栋楼的状况很好。”</p>
<p>Burkett, the Surfside mayor, said a detailed inspection of the North building started on Tuesday. The town is also starting inspections of other older buildings.<br/>
瑟夫赛德的镇长伯克特说，周二已经开始对北塔楼进行了详细检测。该镇还开始检测其它旧楼。</p>
<p>He does not see a reason to tell people to leave the North building. He did, however, say he understands why people might want to leave.<br/>
他没有找出让人们离开北塔楼的理由。然而他确实说理解人们为何可能想要离开。</p>
<p>Esther Drachmann said her husband's 91-year-old mother lives in the building. She and her husband took the older woman to their home.<br/>
埃丝特· 德拉克曼表示，她91岁的婆婆就住在这栋大楼里。她和老公把这位老妇人接到了他们家。</p>
<p>She said her husband's mother would not be able to get out in time if residents had to leave quickly. Drachmann said the woman would return if inspectors say the building is safe.<br/>
她说，如果居民必须迅速撤离，她婆婆将无法及时离开。德拉克曼表示，如果检测人员说这栋大楼是安全的，这位妇人就会回去住。</p>
<p>Leaders of other cities in South Florida are also working to find out if older buildings in the area have been keeping up with repairs and inspections.<br/>
佛罗里达州南部其它城市的领导人也正在努力了解该地区的旧楼是否一直在进行维修和检测。</p>

。
[00:00.04]The search continues for survivors of a building collapse
[00:04.36]near Miami, Florida on June 24.
[00:08.64]At least 11 people died when parts of the 12-floor-building fell.
[00:15.24]And 150 remain missing.
[00:19.80]As each day passes, the chance of finding people alive
[00:25.36]the building known as Champlain Towers South decreases.
[00:32.24]Now people who live nearby in Champlain Towers North
[00:38.80]are wondering if they should leave.
[00:42.72]North was built in 1982, one year after South, by the same company,
[00:51.44]using the same materials and a similar design.
[00:56.64]Just one block away, the nearly 40-year-old building
[01:02.32]has also faced the same seawater and salty air as South.
[01:10.04]Some who live in Champlain Towers North
[01:14.36]feel their building is safer than the South building.
[01:19.40]They say their building does not have the same structural problems
[01:25.80]that were described in the South's 2018 engineering reports.
[01:33.32]The report says the South building had "major
[01:38.12]structural damage" and needed extensive repairs.
[01:44.28]Charles Burkett is the mayor of Surfside,
[01:49.04]the town that is home to the two buildings.
[01:53.32]He said a quick inspection of the North building
[01:58.76]done after the South's collapse did not show any problems.
[02:05.76]But that did not make everyone feel safe.
[02:09.68]Rebecca Weinstock owns an apartment in Champlain Towers North.
[02:17.36]She was in New York when South fell.
[02:21.56]"I'm petrified of returning," she said.
[02:26.92]Weinstock said she will only return
[02:30.56]if two independent building engineers,
[02:34.96]not from Florida, agree the building is safe.
[02:40.80]Philip and Nora Zyne said about 25 percent
[02:46.84]of North residents have left the building,
[02:51.12]but they are staying in their fifth-floor apartment.
[02:57.20]"I'm not worried at all right now," Philip Zyne said.
[03:02.20]But he added that he wants a full engineering
[03:05.80]and scientific review of the building.
[03:10.16]Most residents of the North tower also told the Associated Press
[03:17.68]that they want a full inspection, but they are not leaving.
[03:23.80]And the United States government is offering temporary housing aid
[03:29.60]to residents of the North building who choose to leave.
[03:35.28]Salomon Gold has been one of the leaders
[03:38.56]of the building's resident organization for 20 years.
[03:44.16]He said he and the others always worked to keep the building safe.
[03:51.92]He compared the two buildings to two similar airplanes
[03:57.16]made by the same company.
[04:00.00]He said just because one crashes does not mean the other will.
[04:07.72]"We are in good shape," Gold said.
[04:11.84]Burkett, the Surfside mayor, said a detailed inspection
[04:18.08]of the North building started on Tuesday.
[04:22.00]The town is also starting inspections of other older buildings.
[04:29.36]He does not see a reason to tell people to leave the North building.
[04:34.72]He did, however, say he understands why people might want to leave.
[04:43.16]Esther Drachmann said her husband's
[04:46.24]91-year-old mother lives in the building.
[04:50.08]She and her husband took the older woman to their home.
[04:55.32]She said her husband's mother would not be able to get out in time
[05:00.84]if residents had to leave quickly.
[05:04.48]Drachmann said the woman would return
[05:08.24]if inspectors say the building is safe.
[05:12.76]Leaders of other cities in South Florida
[05:16.48]are also working to find out if older buildings in the area
[05:21.12]have been keeping up with repairs and inspections.
[05:26.00]I'm Dan Friedell.
