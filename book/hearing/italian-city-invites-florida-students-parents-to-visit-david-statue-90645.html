。
[00:00.04]What does a small school
[00:01.52]in the American state of Florida
[00:03.56]have to do with the famous Italian statue of David
[00:08.16]in Florence, Italy?
[00:10.96]Well, the mayor of Florence
[00:13.80]and the museum where David is housed
[00:18.60]recently invited parents, students
[00:22.40]and the former principal of the school to visit.
[00:27.44]The invitation came
[00:29.40]after some parents were upset
[00:32.12]when their sixth-grade children
[00:34.56]at Tallahassee Classical School
[00:37.44]saw a photo of the statue during an art class.
[00:42.24]Sixth graders are 11 or 12 years old.
[00:45.88]Renaissance artist Michelangelo
[00:49.32]completed the 5-meter-tall
[00:51.44]statue of David in 1504.
[00:56.00]The famous work shows
[00:58.04]the Bible story of David
[01:00.04]getting ready to fight Goliath.
[01:03.32]David is represented without clothing
[01:06.64]and armed with a sling over his shoulder
[01:10.08]and a rock in his hand.
[01:14.00]Two Florida parents said,
[01:16.40]under school policy,
[01:19.00]they should have been warned
[01:21.40]that their children were going to see
[01:23.60]the image of David's statue without clothing.
[01:29.36]A third parent called the statue
[01:31.92]pornographic – or overly sexual.
[01:36.76]The principal
[01:38.08]of Tallahassee Classical school in Florida
[01:41.76]said she was asked
[01:44.04]to leave her job as a result.
[01:47.84]But school leaders claimed
[01:50.24]it was one of several reasons for her removal.
[01:54.84]The private school
[01:56.52]follows a program of studies
[01:59.00]designed by a conservative Christian college.
[02:03.68]Cecilie Hollberg is the director
[02:06.92]of the Italian museum in Florence.
[02:10.04]She told the Associated Press,
[02:12.12]"To think that David could be pornographic
[02:15.48]means truly not
[02:17.20]understanding the contents of the Bible,
[02:20.20]not understanding Western culture
[02:23.20]and not understanding Renaissance art."
[02:28.24]The statue of David is the main reason
[02:31.44]thousands of people visit the museum,
[02:34.16]called Galleria dell'Accademia, every day.
[02:39.72]Following the controversy,
[02:41.96]visitors, including many Americans,
[02:45.24]arrived in large numbers
[02:48.04]this week to see the statue.
[02:51.28]Isabele Joles was there
[02:54.12]with a school group from
[02:55.80]the U.S. state of Ohio.
[02:59.08]She studies French and Italian art.
[03:02.44]"It's part of history," she said.
[03:05.56]"I don't understand how you can say it's ‘porn.'"
[03:10.80]Brian Stapley is from Seattle, Washington.
[03:14.36]He said he was sad for the school's children.
[03:18.40]He called the statue
[03:20.44]"one of the most incredible parts of our history,"
[03:24.48]and said he feels "sorry
[03:27.08]for the children that don't get to see it."
[03:30.56]Back in Florida,
[03:32.04]the local newspaper in Tallahassee
[03:34.68]reported a large crowd
[03:37.64]came out to a school board meeting on Monday night.
[03:41.12]Some parents disagreed with the decision
[03:44.36]of the school leaders to remove the principal.
[03:47.28]And the board chairman
[03:49.40]rejected a request from a teacher to resign.
