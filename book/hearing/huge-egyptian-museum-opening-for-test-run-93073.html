[00:00.04]The Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza
[00:04.12]will open a limited number of exhibits
[00:07.68]about ancient Egypt starting this week.
[00:12.92]The limited opening will be a test run
[00:16.24]of the still-unannounced official opening
[00:19.56]of the museum, officials said.
[00:23.60]Starting on October 16, 4,000 visitors per day
[00:29.32]will be permitted to view limited areas
[00:32.96]of the main galleries, said Al-Tayeb Abbas.
[00:37.44]He is assistant to Egypt's minister of antiquities.
[00:44.04]Museum officials have repeatedly
[00:46.72]delayed the museum opening for many reasons,
[00:50.56]including the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:55.00]Some areas have been open
[00:57.08]since 2022 for limited tours.
[01:02.60]The museum is a huge project
[01:05.28]near the famous Giza Pyramids.
[01:09.00]The building project began more than 12 years ago
[01:12.96]and has cost more than $1 billion so far.
[01:19.08]The Egyptian government says
[01:21.36]more than 100,000 artifacts
[01:24.44]of Egypt's ancient treasures
[01:26.84]are on show at the site.
[01:29.92]Officials describe it as the world's
[01:32.88]largest archaeological museum.
[01:37.32]The exhibits in the test run include 12 areas
[01:41.96]that explore issues related to society, religion,
[01:47.44]and philosophies of ancient Egypt, Abbas added.
[01:53.20]The areas are divided by dynasty
[01:56.00]and historical order.
[01:59.16]Historical divisions include
[02:01.76]the Third Intermediate Period, Late Period,
[02:05.60]and Graeco-Roman Period.
[02:09.00]It also includes the New Kingdom,
[02:12.40]Middle Kingdom, and Old Kingdom periods.
[02:16.52]They all represent life
[02:19.96]thousands of years in the past.
[02:24.00]One of the areas displays
[02:27.00]statues of the "Elite of the King."
[02:31.08]These represent members of a king's family,
[02:34.64]and high-level officials who worked in the army,
[02:39.12]government or religious service.
[02:43.36]Abbas told the AP that the test run
[02:47.08]would help prepare for the full opening
[02:50.04]by identifying operational issues.
[02:54.48]This includes finding out
[02:56.56]which parts of the museum
[02:58.52]might become overcrowded.
[03:02.12]A reporter for the Associated Press
[03:04.84]spoke with some tourists at the museum.
[03:08.36]Canadian visitor Aude Porcedda
[03:12.08]told the AP she was amazed by the museum.
[03:16.36]She said she believes it is important
[03:20.44]that the world know about Egyptian civilization.
[03:26.08]Jorge Licano, a visitor from Costa Rica
[03:30.04]expressed similar praise.
[03:33.40]"There is a lot of history
[03:35.52]and a lot of things we are not aware of,
[03:38.56]especially coming from the other side of the world,
[03:42.12]and seeing everything here
[03:44.96]and learning from the locals
[03:47.16]has been great," he said.
[03:50.56]The limited opening includes the museum's
