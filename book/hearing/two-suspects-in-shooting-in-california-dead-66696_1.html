<p>Officials in the city of San Bernardino, in Southern California, have confirmed the names of the two people believed to have shot and killed 14 people and injured 17 at a state government agency Wednesday.加州南部圣贝纳迪诺县有关官员已经确认了周三在一家政府机构打死14人打伤17人的两名案犯的名字。</p>
<p>Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said they were 28-year-old Syed Farook and 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik. Burguan said the two were either married or engaged. The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times newspaper report the two were married and were parents of a baby.<br/>警察局长贾罗德·博甘（Jarrod Burguan）表示，两名案犯是28岁的赛义德·法鲁克（Syed Farook）和27岁的马利克（Tashfeen Malik）。博甘表示，这两人已经结婚或订婚。美联社和洛杉矶时报报道称，这两人已经结婚并且有个小孩。</p>
<p>After the shooting, Farook and Malik were found by police at a home in a town near the shooting. The two fled in a car and were chased by police, who shot and killed them during a gun battle. One police officer was wounded.<br/>在枪杀案之后，法鲁克和马利克被警察在现场附近小镇的家中发现。这两人驾车逃离并被警方追捕。随后警方在枪战中击毙了他们。其中一名警察受了伤。</p>
<p>Burguan said Farook was an employee of the San Bernardino County health department. The city is about an hour east of Los Angeles. The agency was holding a Christmas party at the offices of an organization that trains mentally disabled people. Reports say Farook angrily left the party and returned with Malik. The two carried assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns.<br/>博甘表示，法鲁克是圣贝纳迪诺县卫生部门的一名雇员。该城市距离洛杉矶以东大概一小时车程。该部门当时正在一家培训智障人士机构的办事处举办圣诞派对。报道称法鲁克愤然离开该聚会，并同马利克一起返回。这两人携带了突击步枪和半自动手枪。</p>
<p>A third person was arrested while trying to flee the shooting. Chief Burguan said it was not clear what the man was doing there. He said he is not sure if the man helped the attackers or was trying to find a safe place away from the shooting.<br/>有第三人在逃离枪击时被逮捕。警察局长博甘表示，尚不清楚这名男子当时在那干嘛。博甘表示他不确认该男子是帮助了这次袭击，还是试图寻找一个安全的地方逃离枪杀。</p>
<p>Burguan said it was clear that the two shooters had planned the attack. He said they entered the agency to kill. He said he did not know why the attack took place. But he said a workplace dispute may have been the cause. He called the shooting "domestic terrorism." He said three explosive devices were found in the building and disarmed. He said a robot was searching the couples' home for possible explosives.<br/>博甘表示，很明显这两名枪手曾计划袭击。他说，枪手进入该机构杀人，他不知道为什么会发生这场袭击。但他表示，原因可能是工作纠纷。他称这次枪杀是国内恐怖主义。他表示，在该建筑里发现了三个爆炸装置，并且已经被拆除。一台机器人正在这对夫妇的住宅搜索可能的爆炸物。</p>
<p>Burguan did not say if the dead and wounded worked at the center, were people who were being trained there or worked at the same agency as Farook.<br/>博甘并未没说明死伤者是否就在该中心工作，他们是参加培训的人还是跟法鲁克一样在同一家机构工作。</p>
<p>An FBI official at the shooting scene said he was not immediately willing to describe the shooting as linked to international terrorism. But he said the investigation has found possible links to other countries. He said officials will follow the information wherever it leads.<br/>枪杀现场的一名FBI官员表示，他并没有立马称这次袭击同国际恐怖主义有关联。但他表示，调查发现可能跟其它国家有关系。他说有关方面将会跟踪这些信息，无论它引向哪里。</p>
<p>Hours after the shooting, one of Farook's family members spoke to reporters at a press conference organized by the Los Angeles office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Farhan Kahn said he did not know why Farook had carried out the attack.<br/>枪杀发生数小时后，法鲁克的一位家人法尔汉·卡恩（Farhan Kahn）在美国-伊斯兰关系理事会洛杉矶办事处组织的新闻发布会上对记者表示，他不知道为什么法鲁克会发动这场袭击。</p>
<p>The council's executive director -- Hussam Ayloush -- told reporters "we unequivocally condemn the horrific act that happened today. We stand in solidarity in repudiating any possible ideology or mindset that could have led to such (a) horrific [attack]."<br/>该理事会执行董事胡萨姆·艾卢许（Hussam Ayloush）对记者表示，“我们明确谴责今天发生的恐怖行为。我们团结地站在一起，否认任何可能导致这种恐怖袭击的可能思想和心态。”</p>
<p>Patrick Baccari worked with Farook. He said Farook traveled to Saudi Arabia earlier this year and returned to the United States with a wife. But he did not say if Farook's wife was Malik.<br/>Patrick Baccari是法鲁克的同事。他说，法鲁克今年早些时候前往沙特阿拉伯，并同妻子一起返回。但他并没有说法鲁克的妻子是不是马利克。</p>
<p>The attack on Wednesday was the worst mass shooting in the United States since 2012 -- when 20 children and six teachers were shot and killed at an elementary school in the northeastern state of Connecticut.<br/>周三的这场袭击是美国2012年以来最为严重的一场大规模枪杀案。2012年康涅狄格州东北部一所小学发生的袭击当时有20名儿童和6名教师被开枪打死。</p>
<p>President Barack Obama was being interviewed by CBS television when the shooting in San Bernardino was first reported.

[00:47.12]After the shooting, Farook and Malik were found by police 
[00:53.20]at a home in a town near the shooting. 
[00:57.48]The two fled in a car and were chased by police, 
[01:02.68]who shot and killed them during a gun battle.

[01:34.68]Reports say Farook angrily left 
[01:37.92]the party and returned with Malik. 
[01:42.08]The two carried assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns. 
[01:48.88]A third person was arrested while trying to flee the shooting. 
[01:54.80]Chief Burguan said it was not clear 
[01:58.28]what the man was doing there. 
[02:01.92]He said he is not sure if the man helped the attackers 
[02:06.32]or was trying to find a safe place away from the shooting.  
[02:13.08]Burguan said it was clear that the two shooters had planned the attack. 
[02:19.88]He said they entered the agency to kill.

[02:40.72]He said three explosive devices were found in the building and disarmed. 
[02:48.08]He said a robot was searching the couples' home for possible explosives. 
[02:54.36]Burguan did not say if the dead and wounded worked at the center, 
[03:00.30]were people who were being trained there 
[03:04.40]or worked at the same agency as Farook.
[03:09.56]An FBI official at the shooting scene

[03:57.16]why Farook had carried out the attack.
[04:00.85]The council's executive director -- Hussam Ayloush -- 
[04:05.20]told reporters "we unequivocally condemn the horrific act 
[04:10.76]that happened today.

[04:45.04]The attack on Wednesday was the worst mass shooting 
[04:50.80]in the United States since 2012 -- 
[04:54.04]when 20 children and six teachers
