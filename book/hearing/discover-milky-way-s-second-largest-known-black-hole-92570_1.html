。
[00:00.04]Astronomers have discovered a black hole
[00:03.32]with a mass about 33 times greater
[00:06.56]than that of our sun.
[00:08.44]It is the second biggest black hole
[00:11.60]known in the Milky Way.
[00:13.84]Only the supermassive black hole
[00:17.04]at the center of the galaxy is bigger.
[00:21.48]The newly identified black hole
[00:23.88]is about 2,000 light-years from Earth
[00:26.88]says a new study
[00:28.60]in the publication Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.
[00:32.60]A light year is about 9.5 trillion kilometers.
[00:38.52]The black hole is in the constellation Aquila,
[00:41.72]and has a companion star orbiting it,
[00:44.88]researchers said on Tuesday.
[00:48.76]Black holes are extremely dense objects.
[00:51.92]They have gravity so strong
[00:54.56]not even light can escape,
[00:56.96]making it difficult to find them.
[00:59.84]The European Space Agency's Gaia mission
[01:03.44]found the black hole.
[01:05.32]Gaia is carrying out a huge stellar count.
[01:10.92]The scientists saw that the black hole
[01:13.92]caused its companion star to wobble.
[01:17.08]Data from the European Southern Observatory's
[01:21.00]Chile-based Very Large Telescope
[01:23.72]and other ground-based observatories
[01:26.72]confirmed the black hole's mass.
[01:30.52]"This black hole is not only very massive,
[01:33.68]it is also very peculiar," said Pasquale Panuzzo.
[01:38.52]He is a research engineer
[01:40.80]at the French research agency CNRS
[01:44.40]and lead writer of the study.
[01:48.12]For instance, the black hole, called Gaia BH3,
[01:52.08]and its companion are traveling within the galaxy
[01:56.16]in the opposite direction
[01:57.88]of how stars usually orbit in the Milky Way.
[02:02.48]Gaia BH3 probably formed after the supernova,
[02:06.92]or explosive death,
[02:09.16]of a star that was more than 40 times
[02:11.76]as large as the sun, the researchers said.
[02:16.32]Black holes that result from the collapse of a single star
[02:20.32]are called stellar black holes.
[02:23.00]Gaia BH3 is the largest-known stellar black hole,
[02:28.20]said astronomer and study co-author Tsevi Mazeh
[02:33.04]of the Tel Aviv University in Israel.
[02:38.32]Stellar black holes are small
[02:40.92]compared to supermassive black holes
[02:43.76]at the center of most galaxies.
[02:46.56]Sagittarius A* is the supermassive
[02:49.96]black hole at the heart of the Milky Way.
[02:53.36]It is 4 million times the mass of the sun
[02:57.12]and is located about 26,000 light-years from Earth.
[03:03.28]Gaia BH3's progenitor star
[03:06.44]was made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium.
[03:11.36]Stars in the early universe were of similar chemical formation,
[03:16.20]known as low metallicity.
[03:18.72]The progenitor star had formed
[03:21.52]early in the universe's history,
[03:23.84]perhaps two billion years after the Big Bang.
[03:27.48]When it exploded at the end of its lifespan
[03:31.28]it released material into space.
[03:34.00]The remains violently collapsed to form a black hole.
[03:39.68]The discovery of Gaia BH3
[03:42.52]supports stellar evolution models
[03:44.80]showing that massive stellar black holes
[03:47.72]can be produced only by a low metallicity star
[03:51.52]like this one's progenitor star, Panuzzo said.
[03:56.96]Gaia BH3's companion star
[04:00.00]is about 76 percent of the mass of the sun.
[04:03.84]It is a bit colder, but around 10 times brighter.
[04:09.16]A measure called an astronomical unit (AU)
[04:12.84]is the distance between the earth and the sun.
[04:16.36]Gaia BH3's companion star
[04:19.84]orbits the black hole at a changing distance
[04:22.88]between 4.5 AU and 29 AU.
[04:27.24]By comparison, Jupiter orbits around 5 AU from the sun
[04:32.64]and Neptune around 30 AU.
[04:37.52]Elisabetta Caffau is an Observatoire de Paris astronomer
[04:42.32]and a co-writer of the study.
[04:45.20]She said she was surprised
[04:47.72]that "the chemical composition of this companion star
[04:51.52]does not show anything special,
[04:53.92]so it was not affected
[04:55.72]by the supernova explosion of the black hole."
[05:00.12]Scientists are not sure
[05:02.08]just how big stellar black holes can be.
[05:06.08]"The maximum mass for a stellar black hole
[05:09.28]is a matter of active scientific debate," Panuzzo said.
