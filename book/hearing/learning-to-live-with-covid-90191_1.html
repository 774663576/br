在经历了两年多大流行紧急状况之后，2022年会是世界最终学会与新冠肺炎共存的一年吗？</p>
<p>From Asia to Africa, countries re-opened for business and visitors following developments in COVID-19 vaccination and treatment.
从亚洲到非洲，随着新冠疫苗接种和治疗的发展，各国重新对商业和游客开放。</p>

今年元旦，葡萄牙总统德索萨宣布放宽新冠肺炎限制。他表示，该国已经进入大流行的地方流行病时期。地方流行病是指某种疾病未来几年内在一个地方流行。</p>
<p>Britain's Prime Minister at the time, Boris Johnson, took similar action later that month. Announcing an end to requirements for face coverings, he said, "We will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one."<br/>
时任英国首相鲍里斯在当月晚些时候也采取了类似的行动。他在宣布废除口罩令时表示，“我们将相信英国人民的判断，不再将任何选择不戴口罩的人士定为犯罪。"</p>
<p>The moves were the start of re-opening borders to members of the European Union and then to vaccinated travelers from around the world.<br/>
这些举措是向欧盟成员国重新开放边境，然后向世界各地接种过疫苗的旅行者重新开放边境的开始。</p>

。
[00:00.04]After two years of pandemic emergency,
[00:05.76]could 2022 be the year the world
[00:10.04]finally learned to live with COVID-19?
[00:15.72]From Asia to Africa,
[00:18.08]countries re-opened for business and visitors
[00:22.08]following developments in COVID-19 vaccination and treatment.
[00:29.60]On New Year's Day, Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa
[00:36.00]announced the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.
[00:41.68]He said his country had "moved
[00:44.28]into the endemic" period of the pandemic.
[00:49.36]Endemic means a disease
[00:51.68]has settled in a place for years to come.
[00:56.64]Britain's Prime Minister at the time, Boris Johnson,
[01:01.08]took similar action later that month.
[01:05.68]Announcing an end to requirements for face coverings,
[01:10.68]he said, "We will trust the judgment of the British people
[01:16.32]and no longer criminalize anyone
[01:20.36]who chooses not to wear one."
[01:24.16]The moves were the start of re-opening borders
[01:28.20]to members of the European Union
[01:31.00]and then to vaccinated travelers from around the world.
[01:35.96]Australian officials, however,
[01:39.56]denied entry to Novak Djokovic,
[01:43.44]the world's top tennis player, in January.
[01:47.32]The country's health officials ruled that Djokovic
[01:52.44]failed to meet the country's vaccination requirement.
[01:57.52]The World Health Organization (WHO) added in January
[02:03.76]that countries could consider easing COVID rules
[02:08.00]if they had high vaccination rates
[02:11.36]and strong healthcare systems.
[02:15.68]In June, South Africa lifted its COVID restrictions.
[02:21.44]Visitors can come and go
[02:24.12]without vaccination papers or testing.
[02:28.68]Other African countries including Madagascar,
[02:33.44]Egypt, and Botswana soon followed.
[02:39.44]Many Asian countries opened back up in 2022 as well.
[02:46.04]Thailand, Vietnam, India, Japan, South Korea,
[02:52.08]and Indonesia all eased restrictions and welcomed visitors.
[02:59.76]In the State of the Union speech to Congress in March,
[03:04.24]American President Joe Biden said,
[03:08.00]"Last year COVID-19 kept us apart.
[03:12.72]This year we are finally together again."
[03:17.32]He noted that the gathering did not require face coverings.
[03:22.44]That was possible, he said in his speech,
[03:26.36]because of the progress in vaccine

[03:34.04]As the Omicron version of the virus

[03:59.32]All the earlier approved drugs against COVID
[04:03.24]require injection directly
[04:06.64]into the blood by healthcare professionals.
[04:12.16]Pfizer made Paxlovid available
[04:15.12]at low prices to the poorest countries.
[04:20.76]Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota
[04:25.76]spoke about Paxlovid at the time.
[04:29.16]He said: "You're looking at a 90 percent decreased risk

[05:53.00]with plans to update COVID-19 vaccines.
[05:57.64]Health officials in Britain and other European countries
[06:02.28]also offered "bivalent" shots
[06:05.12]to target different versions of the virus.
