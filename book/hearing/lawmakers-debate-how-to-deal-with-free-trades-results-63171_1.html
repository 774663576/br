美国参议院最近通过了一项所谓“贸易促进权”的措施。根据这项法案，当一项贸易协定达成之后，国会只能投赞成或反对票。当国会审批美国与亚太国家以及欧洲可能签订的贸易协定时，这种快速审批这类协议的能力会很重要。</p>

但是自由贸易问题可能会助长关于美国就业的争论。许多工会和民主党成员支持一项少有人知的针对美国工人的联邦计划，这就是所谓的贸易调整援助计划。该计划为那些因为国外竞争而失业的人员提供经济援助。保守党称该计划并不奏效而且代价过大。</p>

参议院投票通过了扩大这项4亿美元的计划，作为快速审批法案的一部分来加快推进美国同太平洋国家悬而未决的自由贸易协定。众议院尚未对这项贸易立法进行表决。</p>

<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Lawmakers Debate How to Deal with Free Trade's Results]
[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]The United States Senate recently passed a measure
[00:03.86]called Trade Promotion Authority.
[00:06.67]Under the bill,
[00:07.86]the Congress can only vote for or against a trade agreement
[00:12.95]once it has been negotiated.
[00:15.93]This ability to "fast-track" such agreements would be important
[00:22.05]when Congress considers possible trade deals
[00:26.03]with Asian and Pacific countries and also Europe.
[00:30.81]But the issue of free trade can fuel a debate about U.S. jobs.
[00:36.93]Many labor unions and Democratic Party members
[00:41.36]support a little-known federal program for American workers.
[00:47.05]It is called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program.
[00:51.93]It provides financial assistance to those who lose their job
[00:58.01]because of increased foreign competition.
[01:01.95]Conservatives say the program is ineffective and costs too much.
[01:08.52]However, a former steel worker who spoke with VOA
[01:13.77]says the program works and should be expanded.
[01:18.22]Michael Smith worked at the Bethlehem Steel Mill
[01:23.15]in Sparrows Point, Maryland.
[01:25.58]The mill was once a major producer of steel.
[01:30.08]It employed as many as 30,000 Americans.
[01:34.26]Mr. Smith was a crane operator with Bethlehem Steel for 13 years.
[01:41.19]Recently, he returned to the grounds.
[01:44.97]"I remember what this place used to be.
[01:48.21]I remember the sights, the sounds, the tractors.
[01:51.95]It's actually hard physically standing here.
[01:54.74]I mean, my heart hurts."
[01:56.13]The mill closed in 2012 as a result
[01:59.96]of a series of business decisions and increasing global competition.
[02:05.59]That left Mr. Smith and 2,500 mill workers
[02:10.27]with no jobs and few marketable skills.
[02:14.25]"I was blessed enough to find a program
[02:17.90]called TRA ((Trade Readjustment Allowance)) and TAA ((Trade Adjustment Assistance)),
[02:20.68]which is a union bargain benefit that was provided to us."
[02:24.27]The TAA program gave Mr. Smith a weekly stipend.
[02:29.40]He used his retraining assistance to pay for books and school tuition fees.
[02:36.17]He recently completed his college studies
[02:40.21]and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Psychology.
[02:44.74]Michael Smith's experience with the program was good.
[02:49.32]However, many conservatives say TAA is wasteful and ineffective.
[02:57.04]Dan Ikenson studies trade policies for the Cato Institute research group.
[03:03.11]He says that for every job lost to trade,
[03:07.65]30 jobs are lost for other reasons. He spoke to VOA on Skype.
[03:13.93]"My first question is: why should we treat people who lose jobs
[03:17.67]or can tie their job loss in some way to trade
[03:20.75]any differently than we treat other people who lose their jobs?"
[03:24.05]Dan Ikenson says trade creates more winners than losers.
[03:29.03]Instead of government aid,
[03:31.68]he says manufacturers are better equipped to retrain displaced workers.
[03:38.11]"They complain a lot about the dearth of skilled workers,
[03:42.86]and if they were incentivized to hire people
[03:47.95]just to train them in exchange for them agreeing to work,
[03:51.38]maybe for a year or two afterwards,
[03:53.39]that might work a lot better than trade adjustment assistance does."
[03:57.07]The Senate voted to extend the 400-million dollar program
[04:01.41]as part of a fast-track bill
[04:04.10]to speed pending free trade deals with Pacific countries.
[04:08.89]The House of Representatives has yet to vote on the trade legislation.
[04:15.16]I'm Mario Ritter.
[04:17.91].
