<p>And now the Health &amp; Lifestyle report from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Working from home has its <strong>benefits</strong>, but it also has its problems. One of them involves workplace friendships. Working remotely, or away from an office, may make it harder to form friendships with coworkers.</p>
<p>In the United States, only two in every 10 employees say they have a "best friend" at work. That information comes from a Gallup opinion study done in June 2022.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="These close work friends, Catalina Mar&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;237;a Gomez Caycedo (foreground), Aleena Rupani, Henry Crabtree, and Michael Watkins meet in Crabtree's London apartment. (Photo provided by Catalina Mar&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;237;a Gomez Caycedo via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-d3ab-08db0ee7ac4a_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">These close work friends, Catalina Mar<i>&amp;#</i>237;a Gomez Caycedo (foreground), Aleena Rupani, Henry Crabtree, and Michael Watkins meet in Crabtree's London apartment.

<p>Jim Harter is a workplace and well-being researcher for Gallup. He said, "We (are) seeing in the <strong>data </strong>that younger people in general are feeling more disconnected from their workplaces."</p>
<p>Harter added that if young people are "less connected to their workplace," they have fewer chances to connect with their co-workers. It may be difficult to "develop those kinds of friendships that they might have had in the past."</p>
<p>Also, he said there is a difference in levels of trust among work friends. "It (is) a lot more difficult to establish close kinds of relationships when you (are) more distant," he said.</p>
<p>Take for example, Crystal Powers. She is a medical records manager in the state of Wisconsin. Powers began a new remote job in February 2022.</p>
<p>Powers is the only <strong>manager</strong> hired since the pandemic who oversees full-time remote workers. Team building has been difficult, she said. She has not yet met in person two of the five people she oversees.</p>
<p>She said, "It (has) been more <strong>challenging</strong> than it has been in past positions to ... earn the trust in me as a supervisor, because they still do (not) really know me."</p>
<p>She also has found it hard to connect with other managers online. Still, Powers said, she likes working remotely.</p>
<p>Harter, from Gallup, said that having a best friend at work has become even more important since the rise in remote and <strong>hybrid</strong> employment.</p>
<p>For many employees during the pandemic, workplace friendships offered social and emotional support at a critical time, Gallup found from their<strong> </strong>recent study. This is especially true of parents, educators and <strong>frontline</strong> workers.</p>
<p>These workplace friendships also benefited employers. Gallup research shows that employees who have a close friend at work are much more likely to:</p>
<ul>
<li>interact with customers and work partners,</li>
<li>get more done in less time,</li>
<li>support a safe workplace with fewer accidents,</li>
<li>and create and share ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Johnny C. Taylor Jr. is president and chief of the Society for Human Resource Management. He said many good things come from work friendships.</p>
<p>First on his list is worker retention – a company's ability to keep good workers. Next on his list is peace in the workplace. He said work friends can help to keep each other calm when disagreements happen.</p>
<p>More companies, he said, are actively supporting workplace friendships. His organization has nearly 500 employees around the world. One of its programs centers around something that often brings people together -- food. The organization buys <strong>lunch</strong> for people who invite a new person to share a meal with them.</p>
<p>Taylor said, "... we're trying to get people together who have different...lived experiences, backgrounds, et cetera. The idea is, you go to lunch with a stranger and make them a friend."</p>
<p>Henry Crabtree is 26 years old and lives in London. He said that when you have close work friends, "You're not only working <em>with</em> each other but <em>for</em> each other."</p>
<p>He was hired in December 2021 onto a small marketing team for a software company. That company has workers around the world.</p>
<p>"Seeing each other outside work, especially when <strong>colleagues</strong> are from other countries," he said, really helps develop these friendships.</p>
