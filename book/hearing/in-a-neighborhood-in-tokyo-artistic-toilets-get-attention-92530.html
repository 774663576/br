[00:00.04]Tokyo visitors can now join a special tour
[00:04.44]of one of the Japanese city's modern wonders:
[00:08.60]its public toilets.
[00:11.44]Penelope Panczuk recently went
[00:14.08]on the Tokyo Toilet Shuttle
[00:16.48]for a two-hour visit
[00:18.40]of artistic public bathrooms.
[00:21.64]Panczuk got the idea after seeing "Perfect Days",
[00:26.16]the Oscar-nominated film
[00:28.44]about a toilet cleaner
[00:30.28]in the city's Shibuya district.
[00:33.76]"In the U.S. or in France where I originally come from,
[00:38.08]you just don't go," Panczuk said
[00:41.12]of using public bathrooms.
[00:43.44]She added that in Tokyo,
[00:46.68]the bathrooms are "extremely clean,
[00:49.64]they're very safe and each one is so different
[00:53.28]it feels like it's a new discovery each time."
[00:57.16]The shuttle began in March
[00:59.92]with visitors coming to Japan in record numbers.
[01:04.24]A drop in the value of the Japanese yen
[01:08.36]has made it less costly
[01:10.88]for many lovers of Japanese culture
[01:13.60]to visit for the first time.
[01:16.32]Among Japan's most-loved
[01:19.60]technological exports in recent years
[01:22.60]are its toilets produced by TOTO.
[01:26.04]The devices have cleansing sprays,
[01:29.44]heated seats, music, and more.
[01:33.52]The American animated comedy show South Park
[01:37.04]recently had a whole program on the toilets.
[01:40.88]Hip-hop music star DJ Khaled announced on Instagram
[01:46.00]that he appreciated a gift
[01:48.36]of four TOTO bowls from the rapper Drake.
[01:53.00]The nonprofit Nippon Foundation
[01:55.76]started the Tokyo Toilet Project in 2020.
[02:01.04]It asked creators
[02:03.16]including Pritzker Prize-winning architect
[02:06.16]Tadao Ando to develop new toilets.
[02:09.64]The goal was to increase accessibility and artistry
[02:14.40]in 17 public toilets in the Shibuya district.
[02:19.80]The project was not meant

[02:25.32]But Shibuya's government saw a chance
[02:28.64]to increase interest in the area
