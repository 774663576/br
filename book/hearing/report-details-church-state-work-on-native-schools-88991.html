。
[00:00.04]Many Christian organizations operated boarding schools
[00:04.04]for Native American children from the 19th to the early 20th centuries.
[00:09.72]They were part of a project to remove Native culture, identity and land.
[00:15.80]And a new report from the U.S. Interior Department
[00:19.44]shows how closely the U.S. government was involved.
[00:24.64]The Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigation Report
[00:28.88]was started following the discoveries of hundreds of possible graves
[00:34.12]at former boarding schools in neighboring Canada.
[00:38.60]The report centers on the U.S. government's responsibility
[00:42.40]for its own officials' actions and policies.
[00:47.08]The report also details how the government provided money and other support
[00:52.76]to religious boarding schools for Native children.
[00:56.88]The financial support would have normally been banned
[01:01.48]under rules on the separation between church and state.
[01:05.00]But the churches, the report says,
[01:08.40]also influenced the government and suggested people
[01:12.72]for appointments to federal positions on Native affairs.
[01:18.56]The work between the church and the state
[01:21.24]is well known to experts in the field
[01:23.96]and has been the subject of past research.
[01:28.20]But the latest report brings it to a wider audience
[01:32.04]that has begun to learn about the boarding schools.
[01:36.56]The Interior Department report, stating a 1969 Senate investigation,
[01:42.36]says that "federal policy toward the Indian
[01:46.12]was based on the desire to dispossess him of his land.
[01:50.48]Education policy was a function of our land policy."
[01:56.28]An important part of that was training Native Americans
[02:00.12]in jobs that were less dependent on the land
[02:03.32]and separated them from tribal ties.
[02:07.64]Another was turning native people to Christianity.
[02:11.52]An 1886 Commissioner for Indian Affairs document
[02:15.56]attacked Native spiritual traditions
[02:18.24]and said the government should provide help to missionaries.
[02:23.52]Last week's report also says the government
[02:27.12]provided the schools with money
[02:29.04]that was to be paid to the tribes for their land.
[02:33.48]The report notes a 1908 Supreme Court ruling
[02:37.40]that the ban on spending federal money on religious schools
[02:41.40]"did not apply to Indian treaty funds."
[02:46.32]The report identifies 408 boarding schools for Native children
[02:51.68]in 37 states and former territories.
[02:55.28]They were operated or supported by the government
[02:58.72]between 1819 and 1969.
[03:03.72]The report does not say how many were church-run.
[03:08.08]But an earlier report by the National
[03:10.68]Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition
[03:13.64]found that more than 150 were.
[03:17.64]Catholic and Protestant groups operated about half each.
[03:23.68]Last week, 76-year-old Matthew War Bonnet
[03:27.80]testified before U.S. lawmakers about his childhood experience
[03:32.56]at the schools in South Dakota.
[03:36.08]"The government gave the churches our lands to Christianize us,
[03:40.16]modernize us and civilize us," Bonnet said.
[03:45.28]"But the churches treated us wrong. ... The government
[03:49.28]and the churches need to be held accountable."
[03:53.16]Bonnet is a Sicangu Lakota from the Rosebud Sioux Reservation.
[04:00.00]Bradley Hauff, a clergy with the Episcopal Church,
[04:03.80]is a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.
[04:07.04]He said church groups must deal with their history
[04:11.08]of working with the government on these policies.
[04:15.24]"As much as we in the church
[04:17.24]might not want to acknowledge that, it is the truth...," he said.
[04:22.04]At its General Convention in July,
[04:24.76]the Episcopal Church plans to vote
[04:27.16]on an investigation into its work with the schools.
[04:31.24]The church will also acknowledge its responsibility
[04:34.44]for causing emotional pain to generations of Native Americans.
[04:40.00]In April, Pope Francis apologized at the Vatican
[04:44.32]to Indigenous groups from Canada for the conduct of members
[04:48.36]of the Catholic Church that operated the schools.
[04:51.64]He plans to apologize again in Canada in July.
