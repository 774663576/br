<p>Japan plans to remove South Korea from its list of top trading partners in a dispute that may be linked to historical tensions between the sides.</p>

<p>Japan has the world's third largest economy, while South Korea has the 11<sup>th</sup> largest. A trade war between the two could affect not only East Asia, but the world economy.

<p>With its latest move, Harris said, the Japanese government appears to be putting "Korea at the same level as Japan's other trading partners in Asia. <strong>Presumably</strong>, it won't be a total embargo so as to limit the direct impact on Japanese firms," he added.</p>

<p>The Japanese companies named in the South Korean court ruling have yet to pay the money to the forced labor victims. Some of the survivors, who first brought the case, have started legal action to seize some of the companies' property to pay for a settlement.</p>

[00:00.12]Japan plans to remove South Korea from its list of top trading partners in a dispute that may be linked to historical tensions between the sides. 
[00:15.92]The cabinet of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe approved the plans on Friday. 
[00:24.44]As a result, Japan would remove South Korea from a list of what are known as "white countries" with preferred trade relations.
