。
[00:00.04]For the first time ever, scientists have recorded the heart rate
[00:06.08]of the world's largest creature: the blue whale.
[00:11.72]To get this reading, they attached an electrocardiogram device to the body of a whale.
[00:21.04]They found that the mammal's heart rate can slow to just two beats a minute
[00:28.52]as the animal searches for food below the surface of the ocean.
[00:35.76]The highest heart rate they recorded was 37 beats a minute
[00:41.27]after the whale returned to the surface for air.
[00:47.12]The team's study appears online in the publication Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:56.08]The blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived.
[01:01.52]It can grow to 30 meters long and weigh as much as 181,000 kilograms.
[01:11.20]The animal's heart alone weighs more than a fully grown cow.
[01:18.92]Stanford University ocean biologist Jeremy Goldbogen led the blue whale heart rate study.
[01:28.20]He said such research helps scientists understand how massive animals operate.
[01:37.60]Generally, larger animals have slower heart rates.
[01:43.32]A normal human heart of a person at rest beats 60 to 100 times each minute.
[01:52.80]It increases to about 200 beats a minute during exercise.
[01:59.92]The smallest mammals, shrews, have heart rates of more than a thousand beats per minute.
[02:08.36]The researchers recorded nine hours of information
[02:12.92]on a 22-meter-long male from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
[02:21.52]The data did not come easily.
[02:24.80]"First, we has to find a blue whale, which can be very difficult" Goldbogen said,
[02:31.02]because these animals live across massive areas of open ocean.
[02:37.88]But, with years of research experience and some luck, he explained,
[02:43.56]the team was able to position a small boat along the whale's left side.
[02:51.20]Then, the researchers connected a special recording device to a very long pole.
[02:59.72]As the whale surfaced to breathe, they quickly deployed the device
[03:05.06]as near to the animal's heart as possible: just behind its left flipper.
[03:13.16]The small device had four suction cups on it,
[03:17.28]permitting it to remain on the whale for several hours.
[03:24.08]Blue whales belong to the baleen whale family.
[03:28.46]These whales are toothless.
[03:31.31]Instead of teeth, they have baleen,
[03:35.40]a softer material made from the same substance as fingernails.
[03:41.92]To feed, the whales flood their mouths with huge amounts of water
[03:47.67]and then release it through the baleen.
[03:51.85]It serves as a filter, trapping krill and other very small sea animals
[03:59.02]that make up the baleen whale diet.
[04:03.36]During feeding dives, the blue whale under observation
[04:08.32]showed extremely low heart rates, usually of four to eight beats a minute
[04:15.13]and as low as two beats a minute.
[04:19.56]After surfacing to breathe after food dives,
[04:23.28]the whale had heart rates of 25 to 37 beats per minute.
[04:30.92]Blue whales have fascinated biologists and people in general for years.
[04:37.93]They are not only the largest and biggest-brained animals.
[04:43.44]They are also the loudest.
[04:46.48]They can communicate with other whales hundreds of miles away.
