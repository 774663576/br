[00:00.20]President Barack Obama laid a wreath in the Japanese city of Hiroshima on Friday.
[00:07.92]Obama is the first American president to visit Hiroshima while in office.
[00:15.92]The United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city.
[00:20.84]The bombing there and in the Japanese city of Nagasaki
[00:26.04]brought a swift end to World War II.
[00:31.48]Thousands at the ceremony watched
[00:34.28]as the U.S. president stood next to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
[00:40.48]at the Peace Memorial Park.
[00:43.24]Obama then bowed briefly and placed the wreath at the arch memorial
[00:49.92]built to remember the dead and injured.
[00:54.44]"Death fell from the sky and the world was changed," Obama said.
[01:01.72]The president then met briefly with two survivors who were at the ceremony.
[01:08.04]He held the hand of 91-year-old Sunao Tsuboi
[01:14.76]and hugged an emotional Shigeaki Mori.
[01:19.88]Obama talked about the horrors of war
[01:23.68]and the need to work toward a world without nuclear weapons.
[01:29.88]"Technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us," he said.
[01:38.96]Revolutions, or great leaps forward, in technology "requires a moral revolution as well."
[01:50.20]"This tragedy must not be repeated again," said Abe in his speech at Hiroshima.
[01:57.80]"We are determined to realize a world free of nuclear weapons," he said.
[02:05.64]Some Americans objected to Obama's visit to Hiroshima.
[02:11.52]They saw his visit as disrespectful to U.S. veterans who fought in the war.
[02:18.88]For many older Americans, the visit is a painful reminder of conflict and lost lives.
[02:27.92]In Japan, the national broadcaster -- NHK
[02:33.52]-- found that 70 percent of Japanese wanted Obama to visit Hiroshima.
[02:40.56]Only two percent of Japanese polled said they opposed the trip.
[02:47.84]The United States dropped a powerful atomic bomb on Hiroshima
[02:52.88]and a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki in August, 1945.
[03:00.76]Japan was at war with the U.S., Britain, France, China and other nations
[03:08.64]-- which formed a group called the Allies.
[03:12.92]The Allies fought against Japan, Germany and Italy
[03:18.88]-- which were known as the Axis powers.
[03:23.32]The atomic bombs did two things:
[03:26.29]First, they killed 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki.
[03:35.92]Many people died later of burns and the from the effects of radiation.
[03:42.40]The bombs also destroyed both cities,
[03:46.16]leaving few structures standing.
[03:49.64]Secondly, the bombings brought an end to World War II.
[03:55.56]They stopped Japan from its attempt to control East Asia.
[04:01.26]Less than two weeks after the attacks, Japan announced its surrender.
[04:08.84]Japan said it surrendered because of the power of "a new and most cruel bomb"
[04:15.64]according to History.com.
[04:19.88]Since then, Japan has rebuilt and become a modern, rich nation
[04:26.92]with the help of the United States.
[04:30.80]Chris Appy, a professor at the University of Massachusetts,
[04:35.44]spoke to VOA before the president's visit.
[04:39.52]"I was very pleased that he decided to go.
[04:41.60]I think just showing up is (an) important symbolic act
[04:46.56]that many Japanese have wanted for a long time."
[04:50.04]But Appy said he was disappointed that Obama, in his words,
[04:55.08]"appears not willing to apologize."
[04:58.80]"After all, I think in our personal lives we consider it the height of maturity when (an) adult is, is willing to
[05:05.96]take responsibility and accountability for actions
[05:09.68]-- particularly actions that lead to the suffering of innocent victims."
[05:14.48]Professor Appy said "apology and forgiveness are important in Japan."
[05:20.60]American officials said before the trip that the president would not apologize.
[05:29.84]"As a Japanese national, I want to give a sincere welcome to President Barack Obama.
[05:37.24]I think we don't need his apology," wrote Kiyohisa Miki from Japan on VOAnews.com.
[05:47.60]"As President Obama said, Japan and America got over past divides.
[05:54.76]And now we are important friends for each other.
[05:59.76]This is enough, right?"
