[00:00.04]DNA is the main molecule that carries genetic information in the cells of living things. 
[00:09.96]More than 155,000 Americans 
[00:14.88]who shared their DNA for science are about to learn something in return: 
[00:21.63]Do they have any worrisome genes?
[00:26.36]It is part of a very large study to see how people's genetics, environments, 
[00:33.93]and behavior combine to govern their overall health.
[00:40.04]The National Institutes of Health (NIH) said recently it is now starting to tell 
[00:47.87]those in the study about some early findings. 
[00:53.32]Like if they carry variants that can cause any of 59 genetically passed down diseases 
[01:01.54]or cause medication problems.
[01:05.76]Because everyone with the same gene will not have the same health outcome, 
[01:11.70]sharing those results may mean new discoveries.
[01:17.48]Dr. Josh Denny heads the NIH's study, called "All of Us." 
[01:25.08]He asked, "What are the drivers in that variability?" 
[01:31.40]And he added, "The way they change their behaviors in response to the findings, 
[01:38.04]we'll be able to look at that."
[01:41.52]The All of Us study is a never-before-seen effort to reduce differences in healthcare 
[01:49.15]and end today's one-size fits all care. 
[01:54.68]Researchers aim to follow 1 million people from different groups for at least ten years. 
[02:04.36]Their goal is to better understand the complex combinations 
[02:09.63]of reasons that decide why one child gets sick and not another, 
[02:16.44]or why a cure for one patient fails in another.
[02:22.16]Volunteers share DNA samples, medical records and health history. 
[02:29.84]About 560,000 have signed up so far. 
[02:35.48]And more importantly, nearly half are from racial and ethnic groups 
[02:41.87]historically left out of medical research.
[02:46.60]Traditionally, such studies are like a one-way street – scientists learn a lot from volunteers 
[02:55.31]who get little personal information in return. 
[03:00.12]But in an unusual move, All of Us volunteers get to decide if they want to learn 
[03:07.29]health-related genetic findings, long before the study's finished.
[03:14.16]Rachel Peterson is an NIH employee who volunteered for All of Us 
[03:20.31]before recently becoming a leading member of the project. 
[03:25.60]An All of Us genetic counselor 
[03:28.05]informed her that she was at increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer 
[03:35.24]because of a gene named BRCA-2.
[03:39.48]Peterson did not know that was a risk for her family. 
[03:44.44]She plans to discuss health treatments with her doctor, 
[03:48.26]such as increased breast cancer screening. 
[03:53.04]She said, "I kind of shudder to think about what could happen if I hadn't known this."
[04:00.68]Denny estimated two to three percent of study volunteers 
[04:05.61]will learn they have a well-known genetic variant 
[04:09.36]that can cause some cancers, heart conditions, or other health problems. 
[04:16.32]Many more will have genetic variants 
[04:19.06]that affect how their body processes some medicines.
[04:24.60]For now, volunteers will only be given findings they can do something about, 
[04:30.45]such as seeking earlier testing, or changing medications. 
[04:36.76]They will be offered free testing, genetic counseling, 
[04:40.90]and help with sharing the information with their doctors and family members.
[04:47.88]But there is a lot more to learn. 
[04:50.68]For example, many of the disease-linked genes 
[04:55.22]were discovered by studying people of European ancestry.
[05:01.12]Eric Venner of Baylor College of Medicine is a genetics expert. 
[05:07.40]He said different variants may affect other ancestries.

[05:23.32]Denny commented on the power of being able to talk to volunteers 
[05:28.36]who they could work with for tens of years. 
[05:32.52]If new findings affect study volunteers, 
[05:36.20]"we're going to keep things up to date," Denny said.
