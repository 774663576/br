。
[00:00.04]Theo works days, nights, and weekends
[00:03.12]in the tulip fields in the Netherlands
[00:05.52]and never complains of sore muscles.
[00:09.60]How is this possible?
[00:11.60]Theo is an artificial intelligence, or AI, robot
[00:17.96]that looks for diseased flowers each spring.
[00:22.52]The work prevents viruses
[00:25.32]from spreading among the valuable plants.
[00:28.92]The robot looks for troubled tulip bulbs
[00:32.28]and destroys them if necessary.
[00:35.52]They are removed from the healthy ones
[00:37.80]in a processing center after the harvest.
[00:41.84]There are 45 robots like Theo
[00:44.88]working in the tulip fields of the Netherlands.
[00:48.56]Their job becomes important
[00:50.68]as the winter turns to spring
[00:53.36]and peak season nears.
[00:56.92]People come from around the world
[00:58.88]to see the colorful flowers.
[01:02.16]Allan Visser's family
[01:04.60]has been growing tulips for three generations.
[01:09.24]This is the second season that he has used a robot.
[01:13.76]He said it is very costly
[01:18.08]– the same as a sports car
[01:20.16]– about $200,000.
[01:24.12]In the past, knowledgeable farmers
[01:27.72]would walk the fields looking for tulips
[01:31.08]that showed signs of sickness.
[01:34.76]"I prefer to have the robot because a sports car
[01:39.36]doesn't take out the sick tulips from our field," he said.
[01:44.36]"Yeah, it is expensive,
[01:47.32]but there are less and less people
[01:49.20]who can really see the sick tulips."
[01:53.04]The robot has been trained to see the sick plants.
[01:56.72]Red stripes show up
[02:00.40]on the leaves of infected plants.
[02:04.60]The robots roll through the fields very slowly
[02:08.44]– about one kilometer per hour
[02:11.36]– looking for sick tulips.
[02:14.96]Visser called the work "precision agriculture"
[02:18.64]as he explained how the robots work.
[02:23.28]He said the robots have cameras
[02:25.12]and take thousands of photos of the tulips.
[02:29.04]The AI software considers the photos
[02:32.44]and decides which tulips need to be killed.
[02:36.96]"The robot has learned
[02:38.40]to recognize this and treat it," Visser said.
[02:42.48]H2L Robotics is the company that makes the robots.
[02:48.56]Erik de Jong is the managing director.
[02:53.28]He said the robots use GPS coordinates
[02:56.44]to be sure they are killing the correct tulip
[03:00.16]among many tulips in the field.
[03:04.16]He said all of the knowledge they use
[03:06.16]in the computer program that informs the robot
[03:09.28]comes from tulip farmers
[03:11.96]—farmers like Theo van der Voort.
[03:16.36]He is the farmer that the robot is named after.
[03:19.32]Van der Voort retired after 52 years
[03:24.24]of looking for sick flowers in his fields.
[03:28.12]"It's fantastic," he said.
[03:30.36]"It sees just as much as I see."
