<p>This week, General Electric was officially removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a leading measure of <strong>stock</strong> prices for major American businesses.</p>
<p>GE was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, a company that operates healthcare businesses, including Walgreens drug stores.</p>
<p>Based on stocks, the five most valuable American businesses are all technology companies. They are Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="The General Electric logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, June 26, 2018. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/D3EB0E84-B35B-4C27-BB81-FA256DB7854C_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The General Electric logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, June 26, 2018. </span></div>
<p>Big name companies like General Electric no longer have the power or influence they once did. Instead, technology, finance and health care businesses lead the United States economy.</p>
<p>GE was the last <strong>original</strong> member of the Dow Jones industrials. The company was formed in 1892 when the businesses of inventor Thomas Edison joined with a competing company. The famous banker J.P. Morgan financed the deal.</p>
<p>In its early years, shares of GE stock were like those of a current-day high-tech company. The Dow – an industrial <strong>index</strong> – was influenced heavily by the growth industries of the day, such as railroads, copper, oil and sugar.</p>
<p>For a century, General Electric was at the center of American capitalism. Its chief <strong>executive </strong>officer, Jack Welch, was well-known, both across the country and worldwide. At times, GE was the most valuable American company by market value.</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>General Electric has had a difficult time since its stock price rose to an all-time high in May 2000. This led to a three for one stock split. Investors were given three shares of stock for each one they owned.</p>
<p>Over the past year, GE shares have fallen 55 percent while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15 percent. This broke a major rule of the Dow: A company's stock should not be worth less than 10% of the highest price stock in the index.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials is a price-weighted index, which means higher priced stocks have a greater influence on its direction.</p>
<p>"The low price of GE shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S &amp; P Dow Jones Indices. "Walgreens Boots Alliance's share price is higher, and it will <strong>contribute</strong> more meaningfully to the index."</p>
<p>But as financial reporter Allan Sloan explained in <em>The Washington Post</em>, GE could have stayed in the Dow through a <strong>reverse</strong> stock split. Its stock price would have gone to $130. While its market value would be exactly the same, the company would have increased its influence in the Dow.</p>
<p>But being pushed out of the Dow was low on General Electric's lists of concerns.</p>
<p>GE has been coming apart since the Great Recession 10 years ago. The weak economic conditions showed that the company was heavily dependent on its finance business, GE Capital.</p>
<p>Writing in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, reporter Andy Kessler wrote "GE was basically a giant <strong>hedge fund</strong>—a bet on its finance unit, which contributed half of GE's profits."</p>
<p>At the end of 2001, Jeffrey Immelt became the company's chief executive. Under his leadership, the value of GE Capital grew to more than $500 billion. The business expanded through a combination of loans, leasing agreements, equity finance and insurance products.</p>
<p>But when the recession hit, GE had to take $3 billion from Warren Buffett to meet its short-term debts.</p>
<p>"GE have been unwinding this hedge fund ever since," wrote Kessler.</p>
<p>John Flannery became the company's CEO in the summer of 2017.</p>
<p>Last autumn, he warned that GE's power-generation business was hurting. The company cut its <strong>dividend </strong>for only the second time since the Great Depression. In January, GE surprised investors by taking a big charge and setting aside $15 billion to pay for debts held by GE Capital, the company's financial services business. In January 2018, GE announced a $10 billion loss. It also announced plans to sell off $20 billion more in equipment and other assets.</p>
<p>GE investors chase profits instead of earnings and for a long time the company showed profits, right up until it didn't.</p>
