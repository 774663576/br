。
[00:01.04]A United Nations report is warning that economic growth in Asian countries
[00:08.32]"faces significant risk" from rising levels of trade protectionism.
[00:16.20]It says experts are especially worried about United States' trade policies
[00:24.08]with important trading partners such as China.
[00:29.68]The U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) report
[00:36.56]mainly says good things about Asian economies.
[00:42.00]Such countries are now responsible for about 30 percent of all trade worldwide.
[00:50.44]The report noted that the percentage could rise to 50 percent
[00:56.24]by 2050 if the economies continue expanding.
[01:02.96]Asia's export-led growth has helped millions of people
[01:08.48]escape poverty over the past 70 years.
[01:13.58]Many of the exported products are sold in the United States and Europe.
[01:22.08]But the U.N. report notes that in recent years,
[01:26.52]Asian economies have begun to depend on domestic demand
[01:32.36]because of the "prolonged weakness in external demand and global trade."
[01:41.64]The U.N. economists are predicting that Asian economies
[01:47.04]will grow at a rate of close to 5 percent in 2017.
[01:54.24]They expect China's economy to expand 6.5 percent this year,
[02:01.64]with India's growing by 7.1 percent.
[02:07.76]The report described economic conditions in China as 'stable.'
[02:14.20]And Russia's economy is expected to grow because of higher oil prices.
[02:21.32]But the report says trade protectionism could affect employment and economic growth.
[02:30.36]It described trade protectionism as "the most significant risk t
[02:36.16]o the broadly positive economic outlook."
[02:41.16]It noted recent changes in U.S. policies on trade,
[02:46.86]monetary exchange rates and immigration.
[02:51.88]And it said negotiations on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union
[02:58.92]have increased concerns in many countries.
[03:04.08]The report said those worried could have a bad effect on Asia,
[03:10.44]including China's goods exports and India's services exports."
[03:17.47]During the U.S. election campaign last year,
[03:22.24]Donald Trump was very critical of China's trade and monetary policies.
[03:29.48]But after his election as president,  Trump became less critical
[03:35.12]because he wanted support from China
[03:38.69]to stop North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.
[03:44.84]Shamshad Akhtar is the executive secretary of UNESCAP.
[03:51.90]She says the debate over protectionism
[03:56.28]and "distrust of globalization" need to be discussed.
[04:02.92]The UNESCAP report said growing global trade has helped many areas over the years.
[04:11.52]But opposition to globalization is growing in the United States, Europe and other areas.
[04:20.56]People there are critical of free trade policies,
[04:26.44]and companies moving jobs to overseas markets.
[04:32.48]The writers of the report warned of reduced economic growth

[04:46.61]They predicted a lowering of the growth rates by up to 1.2 percentage points.
[04:54.80]The report noted that the Asia Pacific region remains "the engine of global growth."

[05:12.48]It noted environmental damage was a major concern
[05:17.76]in some countries following years of economic expansion.
[05:23.72]It said the growth came at a huge cost to the environment.
