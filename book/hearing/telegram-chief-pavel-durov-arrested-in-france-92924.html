。
[00:00.04]The founder and chief executive
[00:02.72]of the Telegram messaging service, Pavel Durov,
[00:07.52]was arrested in France over the weekend.
[00:11.60]The reports said police detained Durov Saturday night
[00:17.24]at Le Bourget airport in Paris.
[00:20.68]Durov holds citizenship in both France and Russia.
[00:26.36]He landed in France after a flight from Azerbaijan,
[00:31.24]French broadcasters LCI and TF1 reported.
[00:37.20]French media reported on Monday that Durov's arrest
[00:42.36]was linked to a French investigation
[00:45.48]that found evidence that Telegram
[00:48.72]had failed to reduce the spread
[00:51.76]of illegal material on its service.
[00:55.96]French President Emmanuel Macron said
[01:00.20]the arrest was "in no way a political decision."
[01:04.20]He said on the social media service X
[01:08.16]that France "is deeply committed"
[01:11.04]to freedom of expression.
[01:13.20]But he added, "Freedoms are upheld
[01:16.52]with in a legal framework."
[01:19.08]The arrest of the 39-year-old Durov
[01:23.20]was reportedly sought
[01:25.40]by a French investigative agency
[01:28.44]that examines crimes against minors.
[01:32.32]The French media says officials
[01:35.56]are investigating crimes including
[01:38.80]money laundering, drug trafficking
[01:42.12]and other offenses.
[01:43.84]In a statement issued Monday,
[01:47.12]Telegram said the company obeys
[01:50.44]all European Union laws,
[01:52.96]including the Digital Services Act.
[01:56.48]It added that Telegram's moderation methods
[02:01.16]operate within industry standards
[02:04.64]and are always being improved.
[02:07.96]Durov "has nothing to hide
[02:10.60]and travels frequently in Europe," the company said.
[02:15.28]The statement added, "It is absurd
[02:18.88]to claim that a platform or its owner
[02:22.52]are responsible for abuse of that platform."
[02:26.84]Representatives for Durov
[02:29.28]could not be immediately reached for comment.
[02:33.04]French law enforcement officials
[02:35.96]also offered no comment
[02:38.08]because the investigation is ongoing.
[02:41.60]Durov founded Telegram with his brother
[02:45.80]in reaction to Russian government efforts
[02:49.12]to crush large pro-democracy protests
[02:53.16]that took place in Moscow
[02:55.56]at the end of 2011 and 2012.
[02:59.52]The demonstrations led the Russian government
[03:03.52]to introduce new restrictions
[03:06.16]on internet operations in the country.
[03:09.28]Durov left Russia in 2014.
[03:13.96]Russia's agency that governs technology companies
[03:19.04]at one time tried to block Telegram
[03:22.64]but was unsuccessful in fully restricting the service.
[03:27.64]In March, the government said it was working with Telegram
[03:32.56]to remove content that violated Russian laws.
[03:37.64]The messaging service
[03:39.84]is currently a popular source of news in Ukraine,
[03:43.76]The Associated Press (AP) reports.
[03:47.80]Telegram is reportedly used
[03:50.80]by both government officials and the media
[03:54.36]to share information on Ukraine's war with Russia.
[03:58.84]It has also been used to send missile
[04:02.40]and air raid warnings to citizens during the conflict.
[04:08.20]Western governments have criticized Telegram
[04:12.28]for having weak moderation policies
[04:15.48]that are supposed to identify
[04:17.88]and remove illegal material.
[04:21.28]Experts say the lack of enforcement
[04:24.84]makes it easier for individuals to commit crimes
[04:29.40]such as money laundering
[04:31.28]and drug trafficking on the service.
[04:34.56]David Thiel is a researcher
[04:37.76]at Stanford University in California.
[04:41.24]He has investigated the use of online services
[04:45.88]to carry out child exploitation.
[04:49.40]Thiel told the AP
[04:51.88]that compared to other messaging services,
[04:55.36]Telegram is "less secure (and) more lax"
[04:59.88]in identifying and removing illegal content.
[05:04.16]In addition, Telegram
[05:06.96]"appears basically unresponsive
[05:10.24]to law enforcement," he added.
[05:13.08]As an example, Thiel said
[05:15.68]that while the messaging service WhatsApp
[05:18.64]registered 1.3 million reports
[05:22.44]of possible child exploitation in 2023,
