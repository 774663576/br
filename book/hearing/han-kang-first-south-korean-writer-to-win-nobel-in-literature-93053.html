。
[00:00.04]South Korean writer Han Kang
[00:03.56]won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.
[00:09.04]The Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee
[00:12.68]said her work "confronts historical traumas
[00:17.48]and exposes the fragility of human life."
[00:22.36]Born in 1970, Han Kang is the first South Korean
[00:27.64]to win the literature prize.
[00:30.32]Kang began her career in 1993
[00:34.76]with the publication of several poems
[00:38.00]in Literature and Society.
[00:42.08]She published her first story in 1995
[00:46.60]with Love of Yeosu.
[00:50.44]In 2016, Kang won
[00:53.36]the Man Booker International Prize
[00:56.24]for The Vegetarian.
[00:58.84]It tells the story of a woman's decision
[01:02.56]to stop eating meat
[01:04.48]and her family's worry about her mental health.
[01:09.64]The novel was the first of her books
[01:12.40]to be translated into English and was seen
[01:16.84]as her major international breakthrough.
[01:21.36]In a talk with the Booker Prizes,
[01:24.20]published last year, Kang said
[01:27.44]the book was written during a difficult period in her life.
[01:31.60]She questioned whether she could finish the story
[01:35.32]or even survive as a writer.
[01:39.04]"I was suffering from severe arthritis
[01:42.28]...To this day, I feel awkward
[01:45.08]when I hear about the novel's ‘success,'" she said.
[01:49.80]In the novel Human Acts,
[01:52.52]Kang explored the 1980 killing of hundreds of students
[01:57.76]and unarmed civilians by the South Korean military
[02:02.96]in the city of Gwangju, where she grew up.
[02:07.68]"In seeking to give voice to the victims of history,
[02:11.68]the book confronts this episode
[02:14.28]with brutal actualization and, in so doing,
[02:19.08]approaches the genre
[02:21.04]of witness literature," the Academy said.
[02:26.00]Kang is the second South Korean to win a Nobel Prize.
[02:30.52]Former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
[02:34.76]received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000
[02:38.52]for his efforts to restore democracy in the South
[02:42.60]and improve relations with North Korea.
[02:47.16]The literature prize has long faced criticism
[02:50.80]that it is too centered on European
[02:53.80]and North American writings.
[02:56.32]It has also been awarded
[02:58.84]mainly to male writers.
[03:01.32]Kang is only the 18th woman
[03:04.80]to receive the award among more than 100 winners.
[03:09.56]Past winners of the prize
[03:12.08]include well-known writers
[03:14.64]like Irish poet W.B. Yeats,
[03:17.76]American writer Ernest Hemingway
[03:20.96]and Colombia's Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
[03:25.68]In 2016, American singer Bob Dylan
[03:30.28]also received the prize
[03:32.60]"for having created new poetic expressions
[03:36.12]within the great American song tradition"
[03:39.76]Mats Malm is
[03:42.48]Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy.
[03:46.20]He told reporters, "I was able
[03:49.44]to talk to Han Kang over the phone.
[03:52.96]She was having an ordinary day, it seems,
[03:56.32]she had just finished supper with her son."
[04:00.56]The prize comes with a money award of $1.1 million.
