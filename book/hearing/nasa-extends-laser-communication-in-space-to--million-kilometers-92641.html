。
[00:00.04]The American space agency NASA
[00:04.04]has completed a new experiment
[00:07.12]that sent data over 226 million kilometers in space.
[00:14.84]The result marks a major improvement
[00:18.56]over previous tests that measured data transfers
[00:23.44]over 31 million kilometers.
[00:27.00]The method is known as
[00:30.04]Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC).
[00:35.48]The high-speed transfer technology
[00:39.28]uses lasers to send
[00:41.84]large data files over very long distances.
[00:46.72]NASA is looking to the method to improve,
[00:50.92]or upgrade, existing communication technology.
[00:55.68]Traditionally, NASA has depended
[00:59.12]on radio communications
[01:01.52]to send data back and forth through space.
[01:06.08]But this method has a limited bandwidth,
[01:10.04]meaning at a certain point the system
[01:12.80]can no longer effectively process data.
[01:16.44]So, the agency is seeking to use the new method
[01:21.32]to support new technologies
[01:23.96]and planned trips to the moon and other places.
[01:29.36]NASA officials say the DSOC system
[01:33.72]will be able to transfer huge amounts
[01:36.64]of science data through space.
[01:39.88]This is especially needed for large data files,
[01:44.60]as well as high-quality images
[01:47.28]and videos sent from space.
[01:50.80]The DSOC system is based on laser technology.
[01:56.32]Laser communications are also known
[01:59.68]as optical communications.
[02:02.40]NASA explains that the technology
[02:05.92]will permit "up to 100 times more data"
[02:10.56]to be sent back to Earth
[02:12.76]than current radio wave systems.
[02:16.28]"Much like fiber optics
[02:19.32]replacing old telephone lines on Earth
[02:22.64]as demand for data grows,
[02:25.12]going from radio communications
[02:28.32]to laser, or optical, communications
[02:31.80]will allow increased data rates
[02:34.80]throughout the solar system,"

[02:53.84]the smallest pieces of data a computer can process.
[02:58.32]These bits are contained within the laser's photons.

[03:48.04]the time would be cut to nine days.
[03:51.68]Also, laser communications equipment

[03:58.52]Laser-based communication has
[04:01.40]already been demonstrated in low Earth orbit
[04:05.16]and on the moon.
[04:06.84]But the research team working on the DSOC project
