<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:US Economy Bounces Back Strongly in Second Quarter]
[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.36]The Commerce Department says 
[00:08.21]the U.S. economy expanded at its fastest rate 
[00:12.53]in more than two years. 
[00:14.63]From April through June, 
[00:17.17]the economy grew at a rate of 4.6 percent. 
[00:22.08]That is good news 
[00:24.66]following the first three-month of the year 
[00:27.65]when the country's economy shrank 
[00:30.53]by more than two percent.
[00:32.81]Some economists say 
[00:35.94]the second quarter growth is a sign 
[00:39.16]that the U.S. economy is finally improving. 
[00:42.87]Others are not so sure.
[00:46.52]A severe winter is blamed for hurting businesses 
[00:50.97]and keeping Americans away from shopping centers 
[00:55.08]early in the year. 
[00:56.61]The sharp increase in economic activity 
[01:01.10]from April to June was welcome.
[01:04.34]But Bankrate.com financial expert Greg McBride says 
[01:10.92]it is only three-month of growth. 
[01:14.11]He spoke with VOA on Skype.
[01:18.11]"It's certainly nice to see a rebound 
[01:20.02]after the disastrous first quarter 
[01:21.73]that we had. But as I like to say - 
[01:24.86]one in a row is not a streak," McBride said.
[01:26.34]Much depends on whether the economy continues 
[01:29.83]to improve in the last six-month of 2014.
[01:35.12]However, the sharp fall in the first three months 
[01:40.07]of the year means the gross domestic product - 
[01:43.61]the widest measure of the nation's economic output - 
[01:47.73]is unlikely to increase 
[01:50.06]more than last year's 2.2 percent growth.
[01:54.17]Investors on Wall Street, 
[01:58.16]however, have confidence in the economy. 
[02:01.26]The new growth numbers pushed stock prices higher. 
[02:06.64]The S&amp;P 500 Index, 
[02:10.29]an important stock market measure 
[02:13.08]has reached close to two thousand points in recent weeks. 
[02:18.37]That is not far from its record high of 2011 points.
[02:24.96]David Stockton is an expert with the Peterson Institute 
[02:31.24]for International Economics. 
[02:33.47]He says business conditions are improving.
[02:38.09]"I think it does suggest 
[02:40.29]the U.S. economy is moving forward, 
[02:42.16]it's moving forward at a moderate pace, 
[02:44.08]and the condition of U.S. businesses 
[02:48.52]is such that they're increasing their investment spending," said Stockton.
[02:51.15]The Bureau of Economic Analysis or BEA said 
[02:56.50]increased business spending and exports 
[02:59.39]cause the increase in growth. 
[03:02.48]That also could help the job market. 
[03:06.05]The national unemployment rate 
[03:09.54]is currently 6.1 percent. 
[03:12.69]However, wages have remained mostly unchanged 
[03:17.64]although there has been some job growth in the last year.
[03:22.20]Greg McBride believes that is changing.
[03:26.80]"The leading category for job growth here in 2014 
[03:30.43]is professional and business services, 
[03:32.34]so these tend to be higher paying jobs. 
[03:34.12]The job market actually 
[03:35.47]has a little bit of momentum going for it - 
[03:37.19]that's the good news - 
[03:38.35]and has been far more consistent 
[03:40.02]than what we've seen in terms of economic growth," McBride said.
[03:42.19]And that's the Economics Report in Learning English.
