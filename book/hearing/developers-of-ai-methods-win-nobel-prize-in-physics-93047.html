。
[00:00.04]Two early developers of artificial intelligence (AI)
[00:04.64]have won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics.
[00:08.96]American John Hopfield is with
[00:12.24]Princeton University in New Jersey.
[00:14.84]Geoffrey Hinton is a citizen of Canada and Britain
[00:19.60]who works at the University of Toronto.
[00:23.84]The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
[00:26.84]honored them for helping "to develop methods
[00:31.00]that are the foundation of today's
[00:33.76]powerful machine learning."
[00:37.08]The 76-year-old Hinton
[00:39.80]is known as the Godfather of artificial intelligence
[00:44.48]for his part in developing machine learning.
[00:47.96]However, he also has warned that AI
[00:52.28]has created threats to humanity.
[00:56.24]Ellen Moons is a member of the Nobel committee
[01:00.64]at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
[01:04.44]Moons said the two scientists
[01:07.88]"used fundamental concepts from statistical physics
[01:12.76]to design artificial neural networks
[01:16.48]that function as associative memories
[01:20.20]and find patterns in large data sets."
[01:24.92]Moons added that their research has been used
[01:29.20]to make progress in physics
[01:31.56]but has also become part of people's daily lives.
[01:36.00]Technologies like facial recognition
[01:39.44]and language translation are used every day.
[01:44.96]Hinton predicted that AI
[01:47.28]would have a "huge influence" on civilization
[01:50.96]and will bring improvements
[01:53.12]to productivity and health care.
[01:56.72]He told reporters and Royal Academy officials that,
[02:01.68]"It would be comparable to the Industrial Revolution."
[02:07.36]The Industrial Revolution was a period
[02:10.64]of intensive development of machines
[02:13.52]and manufacturing that started more than
[02:16.88]250 years ago in Britain.
[02:21.00]Hinton said,
[02:22.24]"Instead of exceeding people in physical strength,
[02:26.00]it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability."
[02:31.28]But Hinton also expressed concern
[02:34.16]about the possible bad results of AI,
[02:37.44]especially noting, in his words,
[02:40.88]"the threat of these things getting out of control."
[02:45.64]The Nobel committee
[02:47.44]also recognized the possible damage
[02:50.44]the discoveries that it was honoring could cause.
[02:55.16]Moons said AI's "development
[02:58.00]has also raised concerns about our future.
[03:01.60]Collectively, humans carry the responsibility
[03:06.00]for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way
[03:11.56]for the greatest benefit of humankind."
[03:16.20]In the 1980s, Hinton helped to develop a method
[03:20.44]known as backpropagation,
[03:22.80]which is used to "train" computers to learn.
[03:27.92]Later, he headed a team
[03:30.56]at the University of Toronto
[03:33.08]that won the ImageNet computer competition
[03:36.88]in 2012 for designing a "neural network."
[03:42.12]Hinton and AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun
[03:47.68]won the Turing Award in 2019.
[03:51.64]It is the top award in computer science.
[03:55.20]That year, Hinton told the Associated Press
[03:59.32]about the reaction he and his fellow researchers
[04:03.28]received over their work.
[04:06.48]"They thought we were very misguided
[04:09.52]and what we were doing was a very surprising thing
[04:13.64]for apparently intelligent people
[04:16.64]to waste their time on.
[04:18.36]My message to young researchers is,
[04:22.12]don't be put off if everyone tells you
[04:25.56]what you are doing is silly."
[04:29.36]Hopfield is now 91 years old.
[04:32.80]The Nobel committee said he "invented a network
[04:36.44]that uses a method for saving and recreating patterns."
[04:41.56]Hinton used Hopfield's network
[04:44.72]to create a new network using a different method
[04:48.64]known as the Boltzmann machine.
[04:52.04]The committee said this "machine"
[04:54.72]can learn to recognize elements
[04:57.64]in a particular kind of data.
[05:01.72]"What fascinates me most is still this question
[05:05.12]of how mind comes from machine,"
[05:08.24]Hopfield said in a video posted online
[05:11.84]by The Franklin Institute
[05:14.12]after it awarded him a physics prize in 2019.
[05:20.00]The Nobel Prize in Physics is valued at $1 million.
[05:25.56]Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel
[05:28.72]created the prizes to honor discoveries
[05:31.96]that help humanity.
[05:34.76]The first prizes were awarded in 1901.
[05:39.52]On Wednesday, the prize in chemistry will be announced,
[05:44.04]on Thursday, the prize for literature,
[05:46.68]and Friday, the peace prize.
[05:49.80]And, the Nobel for economics
[05:52.20]will be announced on Monday.
[05:54.96]The winners receive their prizes in ceremonies
[05:58.76]held on December 10.
