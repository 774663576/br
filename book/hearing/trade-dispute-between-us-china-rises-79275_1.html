<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Trade Dispute between US, China Rises]

。
[00:00.36]United States President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff
[00:06.64]on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday.
[00:13.00]China quickly answered with its own tariffs on American goods.
[00:20.52]The moves increase the trade dispute
[00:23.55]between the world's two largest economies.
[00:28.72]In a statement Friday morning, the president said the tariffs
[00:33.65]were necessary to prevent "unfair transfer of American technology
[00:40.26]and intellectual property to China."
[00:43.88]The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said the tariffs will start on July 6.
[00:55.12]China's Commerce Ministry answered quickly
[00:58.80]to the U.S. taxes on Chinese imports.
[01:03.56]The ministry announced Friday that it will immediately add tariffs
[01:09.32]of "equal scale and equal strength" on U.S. products.
[01:17.12]The ministry statement gave no details.
[01:21.24]But China had earlier released a list of $50 billion in U.S. products
[01:28.56]that would face tariffs, including beef, whiskey and soybeans.
[01:37.20]If tariffs are placed on those products,
[01:40.76]they would likely affect farmers and rural supporters of president Trump.
[01:48.68]The statement also said China was not going forward
[01:53.36]with deals to buy more American goods.
[01:57.84]In May, Chinese officials had promised
[02:01.45]to buy more American farm goods,  natural gas and other products
[02:08.01]to narrow China's large trade surplus with the United States.
[02:15.12]Trump has blamed the trade imbalance between the two countries
[02:20.44]for the loss of American jobs.
[02:24.56]In March, while signing an order calling for tariffs on China's imports,
[02:31.48]the president said "It is the largest deficit of any country
[02:37.28]in the history of our world."
[02:42.24]China's trade surplus with the U.S. last year was about $375 billion.
[02:52.68]Trump said that with the increased tariffs
[02:56.92]he hopes to cut the trade deficit with China by $100 billion.
[03:05.04]The tariffs were in response to complaints that China requires
[03:10.64]or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology.
[03:17.36]American officials say they have targeted products that might benefit
[03:22.84]from Chinese industrial policies.
[03:27.64]American businesses, however, are worried that rising trade tensions
[03:33.56]will hurt U.S. economic growth.
[03:38.04]Thomas Donohue is president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
[03:44.68]He said tariffs place "the cost of China's unfair trade practices
[03:51.48]squarely on the shoulders of American consumers,
[03:56.24]manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers."
[04:02.88]Gary Cohn was formerly a top economic adviser for the president.
[04:09.88]At an event sponsored by The Washington Post, he added,
[04:15.33]"If you end up with a tariff battle,
[04:18.72]you will end up with price inflation,
[04:22.24]and you could end up with consumer debt."
[04:27.56]The U.S. had earlier announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports
[04:33.80]from Canada, Japan, Mexico and Europe.
[04:38.84]The announcement led major American allies
[04:43.38]to promise their own trade measures
[04:46.40]to answer the American import taxes.
