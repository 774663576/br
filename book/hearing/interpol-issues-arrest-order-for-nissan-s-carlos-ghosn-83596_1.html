<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Interpol Issues Arrest Order for Nissan’s Carlos Ghosn]

。
[00:00.04]Interpol issued a Red Notice Thursday for former Nissan car company chairman Carlos Ghosn.
[00:08.44]The notice is a request to law enforcement agencies around the world to arrest a wanted person.
[00:17.40]Ghosn faces charges of financial wrongdoing in Japan.
[00:23.36]His sudden arrival in Lebanon on Monday, after a stop in Turkey,
[00:29.12]shocked officials in Japan and raised questions around the world.
[00:36.24]The former Nissan chief was set to go on trial in April.
[00:42.00]He was permitted to stay at home under supervision after posting a $14-million bail.
[00:50.48]Ghosn said in a statement that he had fled Japan
[00:54.20]to avoid "political persecution" in a "rigged Japanese justice system."
[01:01.04]Ghosn is often credited with helping French car maker Renault
[01:05.32]and Japan's Nissan recover from near bankruptcy.
[01:09.88]He is a national hero to many people in Lebanon.
[01:15.56]That country's justice minister, Albert Serhan,
[01:19.16]told The Associated Press that Lebanon "will carry out its duties."
[01:25.12]But he said that Lebanon has not received an official extradition request from Japan.
[01:32.24]And he noted that the two countries do not have an extradition treaty.
[01:38.92]Serhan added that Ghosn entered Lebanon on a legal passport
[01:43.76]and there is no charge against Ghosn in Lebanon.
[01:48.28]Born in Brazil to Lebanese parents and educated in France,
[01:53.36]Ghosn holds passports from all three countries.
[01:58.40]How Ghosn managed to flee Japan is still a mystery to many,
[02:03.48]including his own lawyers and officials in Japan and Turkey.
[02:09.96]Airline flight data suggest Ghosn traveled on two different planes
[02:15.32]-- one from Japan to Turkey and another from Turkey to Lebanon.
[02:21.20]The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported that a plane carrying Ghosn
[02:25.76]landed at Istanbul's airport on the morning of December 29.
[02:31.28]Ghosn did not register upon landing and left on another plane for Lebanon.
[02:38.84]Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Thursday
[02:43.28]that Turkish officials had detained seven people in connection with Ghosn's escape.
[02:50.32]A Turkish police spokesperson said the seven included four pilots and three airport workers.
[02:58.96]The Reuters news agency reported that all seven were expected to give statements in court on Thursday.
[03:07.84]In Japan, officials entered Ghosn's home in Tokyo on Thursday to look for evidence.
[03:14.72]The search went on as government offices in Japan are still closed this week for the New Year holiday.
[03:23.32]Ghosn's lawyers in Japan said they had no knowledge of his escape and they had all three of his passports.
[03:32.40]Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV, however, reported that Ghosn had a second French passport.
[03:41.52]Ghosn was first arrested in Japan in November 2018.
[03:46.80]He faces four charges of financial wrongdoings,
[03:50.76]including hiding his earnings through payments to car businesses in the Middle East.
[03:57.88]At the time of his arrest, Ghosn was head of both Renault and Nissan automobile companies.
[04:05.40]He said Japanese officials created false charges against him
[04:09.84]to try to stop a possible merger between Nissan and Renault.
[04:16.16]On Thursday, Ghosn tried to distance his family from any part in his escape.
[04:23.32]He called reports that his family was involved with his leaving Japan "false and misleading."
[04:31.08]"I alone organized my departure," Ghosn said.
