。
[00:00.00]President Donald Trump says the United States
[00:04.46]has decided to increase tariff rates on Turkish steel and aluminum.
[00:12.56]Trump announced the action Friday on Twitter.
[00:18.49]The tariff for steel imported from Turkey will now be 50 percent.
[00:26.61]Import taxes for aluminum will be 20 percent.
[00:32.20]That is two times the level announced earlier this year in March.
[00:39.68]The United States is the biggest destination for Turkish steel exports.
[00:48.35]Turkey answered the March tariff announcement
[00:52.55]by placing its own tariffs on $267 million of U.S. goods.
[01:00.39]Turkey said it would respond to the new U.S. tariff action "without delay"
[01:07.86]and warned the move would further harm relations between the two countries.
[01:15.62]Trump tweeted that the latest tariff decision came as Turkey's currency,
[01:23.56]the lira, "slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar."
[01:31.03]The lira's value fell about 13 percent against the dollar on Friday.
[01:38.82]The currency is down about 40 percent so far this year.
[01:45.19]Economic experts believe the sharp fall of the lira
[01:51.64]is mainly because of concerns about the government's economic policies.
[01:58.28]The weakened currency's value has helped increase inflation
[02:03.82]and worried international investors.
[02:07.66]Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan won another term
[02:14.97]in office in June with expanded powers.
[02:19.20]He has said Turkey's economy remains strong,
[02:23.56]noting a 7.4 percent growth rate in the first three months of this year.
[02:30.62]But some investors fear the Turkish economy
[02:34.46]is growing too quickly and could face problems.
[02:39.29]Erdogan has been putting pressure on the central bank
[02:44.72]not to raise interest rates in an attempt to help borrowers.
[02:50.63]But experts argue that the central bank should instead raise interest rates
[02:57.21]to ease inflation and to support the currency.
[03:01.91]Erdogan has blamed outside forces for trying to bring down Turkey's economy.
[03:10.01]On Friday, he said the country had to take steps
[03:14.84]in answer "to those who have waged an economic war against us."
[03:20.54]He urged Turkish citizens to immediately exchange their gold and dollars for lira.
[03:29.68]In his tweet about the new tariffs,
[03:33.78]Trump said "Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"
[03:39.68]One of the difficult issues affecting U.S.-Turkish relations is a dispute
[03:47.47]over an American clergyman who has been jailed in Turkey since December 2016.
[03:56.01]Turkey has accused Andrew Craig Brunson of spying and "committing crimes
[04:03.69]on behalf of terror groups without being a member."
[04:07.98]Brunson is on trial and faces up to 35 years in prison if he is found guilty.
[04:16.99]The United States placed sanctions on two Turkish officials
[04:22.81]earlier this month because of Brunson's case.
[04:27.28]Erdogan said Turkey is not afraid of outside "threats."
[04:33.60]He added that the country will continue
[04:37.21]to enjoy good economic relations with several major nations.
[04:42.30]These include places "from Iran, to Russia,
[04:48.18]to China and some European countries," he said.
[04:53.59]On Friday, Erdogan spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[05:01.74]A Russian government statement said the two discussed economic and trade ties,
[05:08.53]including the success of several joint projects.
