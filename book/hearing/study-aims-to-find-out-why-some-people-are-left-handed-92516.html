<p>What do Lady Gaga, Barack Obama, and Bill Gates have in common – aside from their fame? They are all left-handed.</p>
<p>But why are 10 percent of people left-handed while most are right-handed?</p>
<p>Researchers are trying to find out.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - New York Mets' T.J.

<p>A recent study identified a genetic cause of left-handedness in some people. Researchers found rare variants of a gene involved in controlling the shape of cells. They found the variants to be 2.7 times more common in left-handed people.</p>
<p>These genetic variants account for possibly 0.1 percent of left-handedness. But the researchers said a gene, called TUBB4B, might play a part in the development of brain asymmetry.</p>
<p>In most people, the two halves, or hemispheres, of the brain have slightly different structures and are dominant for different activities.</p>
<p>"For example, most people have left-hemisphere dominance for language, and right-hemisphere dominance for tasks that require directing visual attention to a location in space," said Clyde Francks of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands. Francks was the top writer of the study published recently in Nature Communications.</p>
<p>Francks suggested that for most people, the left side of the brain controls the dominant right hand. "The nerve fibers cross from left-to-right in the lower part of the brain," Francks said. He added, "In left-handers, the right hemisphere is in control of the dominant hand. The question is: what causes the asymmetry of the brain to develop differently in left-handers?"</p>
<p>TUBB4B controls a protein that gets formed into filaments called microtubules. These microtubules give structure to the insides of cells. The changes in TUBB4B that are more common in left-handers suggest that microtubules are involved in setting up the brain's normal asymmetries, Francks said.</p>
<p>The two brain hemispheres start to develop differently in the human embryo. Scientists do not know the mechanism that controls this.</p>
<p>"Rare genetic variants in just a handful of people can pinpoint genes that give clues to developmental mechanisms of brain asymmetry in everyone," Francks added. TUBB4B is an example.</p>
<p>The study's findings were based on genetic data from more than 350,000 middle-aged to older adults in Britain. It was from the UK Biobank. About 11 percent of the people involved were left-handed.</p>
<p>For most people, left- or right-handedness might come down to chance. Changes in the levels of some molecules during important times of brain development could influence it, Francks suggested.</p>
<p>Historically, many cultures disapproved of left-handedness and forced people to become right-handed.</p>
<p>In English, the word "right" also means "correct" or "proper." And the expression a "left-handed compliment" means that a comment might seem nice but is an insult.</p>
<p>The levels of left-handedness differ around the world, with lower rates in Africa, Asia and the Middle East compared to Europe and North America, Francks said.</p>
<p>"This likely reflects suppression of left-handedness in some cultures - making left-handed kids switch to right-handedness, which also used to happen in Europe and North America," Francks added.</p>
<p>The new findings might have use in the field of mental health. People with schizophrenia are around twice as likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous. People with autism are around three times as likely, Francks said.</p>
<p>He observed that genes involved in developing the brain in early life might be involved in brain asymmetry and mental health.</p>
<p>"Our study found suggestive evidence of this, and we have also seen it in previous studies where we looked at more common genetic variants in the population," Francks added.</p>
