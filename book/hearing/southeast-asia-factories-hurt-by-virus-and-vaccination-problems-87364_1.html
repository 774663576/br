<div class="content">New research shows that factory activity across Southeast Asia fell sharply in July because of increasing cases of the coronavirus's Delta variant.
新的研究表明，由于新冠病毒德尔塔变种病例的增加，7月份东南亚各地的工厂活动急剧下降。
<p>The results were based on a series of business surveys completed this week. The economic difficulties were also linked to slow progress in coronavirus vaccinations in many Southeast Asian nations.

经济专家表示，工厂生产的大幅下滑威胁到全球一些最具弹性市场的增长。东南亚在过去几次重大经济危机中都得以幸免，部分原因是这些国家实施了经济改革，并且该地区邻近中国。</p>

总部位于英国的汇丰银行的经济学家对路透社表示，几个国家的疫苗接种率低正在威胁这些经济体。他们指出越南、菲律宾和泰国的疫苗接种率较低。</p>
<p>"Populations in these countries could remain vulnerable not only to the current outbreak, but any future mutations that may develop," HSBC said in a statement. Virus-related restrictions are likely to continue, the bank said, leaving many factories without workers.<br/>
汇丰银行在一份声明中表示：“这些国家的人口可能不仅容易受到当前疫情的影响，还容易受到未来可能产生的任何突变的影响。”该银行表示，与病毒相关的限制可能会继续下去，导致许多工厂没有工人。</p>

<p>The company's president, Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, spoke to Reuters news agency. She said: "There are 350 tonnes of fruit per day, but now we can take only 250 tonnes because of not enough workers to process."<br/>

在越南，包括三星、富士康和耐克在内的几家大型跨国企业在该国都有生产业务。在该国南方地区，大流行限制迫使一些企业夜间将工人隔离在生产中心。</p>
<p>Vietnam's government said last week that industrial production fell sharply in several southern cities facing restrictions since July.<br/>
越南政府上周表示，自7月以来，南部几个面临限制的城市的工业生产大幅下滑。</p>
<p>Malaysia supplies about 67 percent of the worldwide rubber glove market. But pandemic restrictions forced much of those operations to halt production in June and July.<br/>
马来西亚供应了全球约67%的橡胶手套市场。但是大流行的限制迫使其中大部分业务在今年六七月份停产。</p>

该国手套制造协会的呼吁导致限制放宽，允许60%的工人复工。该协会目前呼吁全面复工。</p>
<p>Factory slowdowns in Southeast Asia have already caused problems in other countries, including in Germany.

[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]New research shows that factory activity
[00:04.52]across Southeast Asia fell sharply in July
[00:10.20]because of increasing cases of the coronavirus's Delta variant.
[00:18.28]The results were based on a series
[00:21.32]of business surveys completed this week.
[00:26.36]The economic difficulties were also linked
[00:30.48]to slow progress in coronavirus vaccinations
[00:35.60]in many Southeast Asian nations.
[00:40.24]Economic experts say the big drop in factory production
[00:45.84]threatens growth in some of the world's most resilient markets.
[00:52.08]Southeast Asia has survived several major economic crises
[00:58.96]in the past, partly because its nations have enacted
[01:03.68]economic reforms and the area is close to China.
[01:10.24]But the continuing coronavirus pandemic
[01:14.28]–- driven by a recent rise in infections of the Delta variant
[01:20.00]–- is creating new problems.
[01:23.76]Economists with British-based banking group HSBC
[01:29.68]told Reuters news agency that low vaccination rates
[01:34.80]in several countries are threatening these economies.
[01:40.28]They pointed to low vaccination rates
[01:43.84]in Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand.
[01:49.52]"Populations in these countries could remain vulnerable
[01:55.12]not only to the current outbreak, but any future mutations
[02:00.64]that may develop," HSBC said in a statement.
[02:07.08]Virus-related restrictions are likely to continue,
[02:11.96]the bank said, leaving many factories without workers.
[02:18.52]Thailand is Asia's fourth-largest auto exporter
[02:23.64]and a production base for major world car brands.
[02:28.76]But Toyota suspended production in July
[02:33.44]at three of its factories in the country
[02:36.84]because of parts shortages caused by the pandemic.
[02:43.12]Siam Agro-Food Industry, a Thai processed fruit exporter,
[02:49.48]depends heavily on migrant labor.
[02:53.44]But it has only been able to fill 400 of 550 positions
[03:01.08]as workers return to their home countries
[03:04.96]and are not able to come back to work
[03:08.52]because of closed borders.
[03:12.20]The company's president, Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong,
[03:16.88]spoke to Reuters news agency.
[03:20.36]She said: "There are 350 tonnes of fruit per day,
[03:26.16]but now we can take only 250 tonnes
[03:30.44]because of not enough workers to process."
[03:35.12]In Vietnam, several big international companies including Samsung,
[03:41.60]Foxconn and Nike, have production operations in the country.
[03:48.64]In the south, pandemic restrictions have forced some businesses
[03:54.12]to keep workers isolated at their production centers at night.
[04:00.84]Vietnam's government said last week that industrial production
[04:06.48]fell sharply in several southern cities facing restrictions since July.
[04:14.12]Malaysia supplies about 67 percent
[04:17.92]of the worldwide rubber glove market.
[04:21.52]But pandemic restrictions forced much of those operations
[04:27.32]to halt production in June and July.
[04:32.36]An appeal by the country's glove-making association
[04:36.68]led to eased restrictions that permitted
[04:40.40]60 percent of the workers to return.
[04:44.80]The association is now calling for a full return.
[04:50.44]Factory slowdowns in Southeast Asia
[04:53.88]have already caused problems in other countries,
[04:58.00]including in Germany.
[05:00.12]German electronics maker Infineon Technologies
[05:05.36]said it is expecting losses of millions of dollars
[05:10.00]from shutdowns at its Malaysia factory.
[05:14.72]The production problems will also affect Infineon's
[05:19.16]automotive customers, the company said.
[05:23.64]Daniel Bernbeck is head
[05:26.12]of the Malaysian-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
[05:31.28]He said Malaysia's current quarantine rules
[05:35.72]have made it difficult for manufacturers of costly products
[05:40.88]like computer chips to provide the needed technical knowledge.
