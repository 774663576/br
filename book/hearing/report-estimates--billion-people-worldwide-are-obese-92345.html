[00:00.04]A new study estimates
[00:02.20]more than 1 billion people worldwide
[00:06.12]are currently living with obesity.
[00:09.44]People with obesity
[00:12.00]are considered medically overweight.
[00:15.20]The study, published
[00:17.32]in the medical publication The Lancet,
[00:20.44]said that one in eight people are obese.
[00:24.76]Researchers said around 43 percent of adults
[00:29.48]were overweight in 2022.
[00:33.08]Worldwide, obesity among adults
[00:37.24]has more than doubled since 1990, the study found.
[00:42.80]Among young people aged five to 19,
[00:47.32]the obesity rate increased
[00:49.64]by four times during the same period.
[00:53.24]"A staggering number of people
[00:56.20]are living with obesity,"
[00:58.16]declared the lead writer of the study, Majid Ezzati.
[01:03.32]He is a professor at Imperial College London.
[01:08.36]Severe obesity is strongly linked
[01:12.04]to a long list of health problems and an early death.
[01:16.84]Researchers used data
[01:20.32]from more than 3,600 population studies
[01:25.40]involving 222 million people, The Lancet reported.
[01:31.64]The study "measured height and weight
[01:35.28]in representative samples
[01:37.72]of the general population," the researchers said.
[01:42.60]The World Health Organization (WHO)
[01:46.76]said in a statement that it shared data
[01:50.16]with other international researchers
[01:53.20]and helped to create the report.
[01:57.04]WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
[02:02.80]said the study identifies the "importance
[02:07.00]of preventing and managing obesity
[02:10.72]from early life to adulthood."
[02:13.64]The WHO noted that
[02:16.44]at the World Health Assembly in 2022,
[02:20.76]member states agreed to an agency plan
[02:24.64]to fight obesity.
[02:26.88]So far, 31 governments
[02:30.12]"are now leading the way" to reduce obesity
[02:34.04]by carrying out goals of the plan.
[02:37.52]These include government measures
[02:41.12]to enact new rules on "harmful"
[02:44.04]marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to children.
[02:48.48]In addition, governments are aiming
[02:51.64]to improve school and nutrition policies.
[02:55.64]They are also seeking price reductions
[02:59.32]for healthy foods, to increase public awareness
[03:03.00]about healthy diets and exercise
[03:05.88]and to strengthen requirements
[03:09.20]for physical activity in schools.
[03:12.48]Imperial College's Ezzati said that obesity rates
[03:18.16]are not rising in many wealthier nations.
[03:21.84]But they are quickly increasing in other countries.
[03:26.12]He noted that some countries
[03:28.80]have many underweight people,
[03:31.32]meaning the nations are facing what he called
[03:35.08]a "double burden" of nutrition problems.
[03:39.16]Francesco Branca is head of nutrition at the WHO.
[03:45.00]He told reporters, "In the past,
[03:48.48]we have been thinking of obesity
[03:51.24]as a problem of the rich.
[03:53.72]Obesity is a problem of the world."
[03:57.96]The research represented the first
[04:00.96]major report on the issue since 2017,
[04:05.68]with more than 1,500 scientists taking part.
[04:11.08]That report estimated around 774 million people
[04:17.24]above the age of five were living with obesity.
[04:21.92]Branca and Ezzati suggested
[04:25.36]that powerful new obesity drugs
[04:28.64]– such as Ozempic and Wegovy
[04:32.08]– could be helpful tools in reducing obesity.
[04:36.08]But they noted that the cost and availability
[04:40.48]of the drugs might increase inequality.
