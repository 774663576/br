<div class="content">The U.S. government on Monday recognized President-elect Joe Biden as the "apparent winner" of the November 3 election. The move officially lets the transition of power begin. It comes after President Donald Trump spent weeks attempting to overturn election results with baseless claims of cheating.
美国政府周一承认候任总统乔·拜登是11月3日大选“明显的胜者。”此举标志着总统权利过渡的正式展开。在此之前，川普总统花费了数周时间试图以毫无根据的作弊主张来推翻选举结果。
<p>The process began after General Services Administrator Emily Murphy gave permission to Biden to work with federal agencies ahead of his inauguration on January 20.
在美国总务管理局的艾米莉·墨菲允许拜登在1月20日就职前同联邦机构合作之后，这一过程就开始了。</p>
<p>Trump has not yet admitted defeat and promised to continue his legal fight over the election results. However, he wrote on Twitter Monday that he was directing his team to cooperate with the transition.<br/>
川普尚未承认败选，并承诺继续就选举结果发起法律诉讼。然而，他周一在推特上写道，他正指示他的团队配合权力过渡。</p>
<p>Murphy, explaining her decision, noted "recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results."<br/>
墨菲在解释自己的决定时提到了“法律诉讼和大选结果认证的最新进展。”</p>
<p>She acted after Michigan on Monday certified Biden's victory in the state and a federal judge in Pennsylvania dismissed a Trump campaign case that sought to prevent certification in that state.<br/>
在她做出这一决定之前，密歇根州周一认证了拜登在该州的胜选，宾夕法尼亚州一位联邦法官驳回了川普一项旨在防止该州认证大选结果的竞选案件。</p>
<p>An increasing number of Republicans have been publicly recognizing Biden's victory, after weeks of supporting Trump in disputing the voting results.<br/>
在支持川普对大选结果提出异议的几周之后，越来越多共和党人公开承认拜登的胜选。</p>
<p>Yohannes Abraham leads the Biden transition team. He said the team can now begin to attack the problems facing the nation, "including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track."<br/>
约翰内斯·亚伯拉罕领导着拜登的过渡团队。他说，该团队现在可以开始解决美国面临的问题，“包括控制新冠疫情以及让美国经济重回正轨。”</p>
<p>Murphy, a Trump appointee, had faced criticism for failing to open the transition process sooner. The delay prevented Biden and his team from working with government officials on plans for his administration. The delay also blocked them from secret national security materials and hurt the team's ability to make plans for dealing with the health crisis.<br/>
川普任命的墨菲因未能尽快开启过渡进程而受到批评。这一推迟使得拜登及其团队无法与政府官员合作制定他的执政计划。这一推迟还使得他们无法获得秘密的国家安全材料，并损害了该团队制定应对健康危机计划的能力。</p>
<p>In her letter to Biden Monday, Murphy said she acted on her own.<br/>
墨菲在周一写给拜登的信中表示，她是按照自己的意愿行事。</p>
<p>"Please know that I came to my decision independently, based on the law and available facts. I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official — including those who work at the White House or GSA — with regard to the substance or timing of my decision," she wrote.<br/>
她写道：“请注意，我是根据法律和现有事实独立地做出决定。关于我做出决定，以及做决定的时间，我从未受到任何行政部门官员（包括在白宫或美国总务管理局中工作的人员）直接或间接施加压力。”</p>
<p>Trump tweeted shortly after Murphy's decision: "We will keep up the good fight and I believe we will prevail!" But the post also said that he had advised the GSA official and her team, as well as his own, to carry out usual transition duties.<br/>
在墨菲的决定发出后不久，川普在推特上表示：“我们会继续不懈努力。我相信我们会胜利！”但是川普在推文中也表示，他已经建议墨菲及其团队，以及他自己的团队执行常规的过渡职能。</p>
<p>The GSA will now release $6.3 million to Biden's transition team, as well as 16,000 square meters of federal office space. This includes secure areas where Biden and his team can receive sensitive intelligence information.<br/>
美国总务管理局现在将向拜登的过渡团队发放630万美元资金，以及提供1.6万平方米的联邦办公场地。这里面包括拜登及其团队可以接收敏感情报信息的安全区。</p>
<p>Most recent presidents-elect have had about 77 days between their election win and their first day in office. Biden's team will have 57 days.<br/>
最近几届候任总统在大选获胜到头一天上任之间大约有77天时间。拜登的团队将会有57天时间。</p>
<p>In the year 2000, the GSA delayed offering promised support to a president-elect because of a vote recount that took place in Florida. That recount was finalized on December 13.<br/>
在2000年，美国总务管理局推迟了向候任总统提供承诺的支持，因为佛罗里达州发生了重新计票。那次重新计票于12月13日完成。</p>
<p>That gave the team of incoming President George W. Bush less time and support ahead of Bush's first day in office.<br/>
这使得即将上任的小布什总统团队在总统上任前只获得了很少的时间和支持。</p>
<p>An official report said the shortened transition period made the nation less prepared for the September 11 terror attacks that took place in Bush's first year in office.<br/>
一份官方报告称，过渡期的缩短使得美国对小布什执政头一年发生的911恐怖袭击准备不足。</p>

。
[00:00.04]The U.S. government on Monday
[00:03.44]recognized President-elect Joe Biden
[00:07.16]as the "apparent winner" of the November 3 election.
[00:12.36]The move officially lets the transition of power begin.
[00:17.68]It comes after President Donald Trump
[00:21.40]spent weeks attempting to overturn election results
[00:26.00]with baseless claims of cheating.
[00:29.56]The process began after General Services Administrator Emily Murphy
[00:35.28]gave permission to Biden to work with federal agencies
[00:40.12]ahead of his inauguration on January 20.
[00:46.00]Trump has not yet admitted defeat
[00:49.08]and promised to continue his legal fight
[00:52.64]over the election results.
[00:55.40]However, he wrote on Twitter Monday
[00:58.40]that he was directing his team
[01:00.80]to cooperate with the transition.
[01:04.76]Murphy, explaining her decision, noted
[01:08.92]"recent developments involving legal challenges
[01:12.64]and certifications of election results."
[01:17.00]She acted after Michigan on Monday certified Biden's victory in the state
[01:23.68]and a federal judge in Pennsylvania dismissed a Trump campaign case
[01:29.64]that sought to prevent certification in that state.
[01:34.60]An increasing number of Republicans
[01:37.40]have been publicly recognizing Biden's victory,
[01:41.12]after weeks of supporting Trump in disputing the voting results.
[01:46.08]Yohannes Abraham leads the Biden transition team.
[01:51.84]He said the team can now begin to attack the problems facing the nation,
[01:57.96]"including getting the pandemic under control
[02:01.64]and our economy back on track."
[02:05.72]Murphy, a Trump appointee, had faced criticism
[02:10.40]for failing to open the transition process sooner.
[02:15.32]The delay prevented Biden and his team
[02:18.40]from working with government officials on plans for his administration.
[02:23.96]The delay also blocked them from secret national security materials
[02:29.80]and hurt the team's ability to make plans for dealing with the health crisis.
[02:37.36]In her letter to Biden Monday, Murphy said she acted on her own.
[02:42.80]"Please know that I came to my decision independently,
[02:47.36]based on the law and available facts.
[02:50.48]I was never directly or indirectly pressured by any Executive Branch official
[02:57.08]— including those who work at the White House or GSA
[03:00.92]— with regard to the substance or timing of my decision," she wrote.
[03:06.76]Trump tweeted shortly after Murphy's decision:
[03:10.40]"We will keep up the good fight and I believe we will prevail!"
[03:14.64]But the post also said that he had advised the GSA official and her team,
[03:20.64]as well as his own, to carry out usual transition duties.
[03:26.36]The GSA will now release $6.3 million to Biden's transition team,
[03:33.44]as well as 16,000 square meters of federal office space.
[03:39.88]This includes secure areas where Biden
[03:43.24]and his team can receive sensitive intelligence information.
[03:49.28]Most recent presidents-elect have had about 77 days
[03:54.80]between their election win and their first day in office.
[03:59.64]Biden's team will have 57 days.
[04:04.76]In the year 2000, the GSA delayed offering promised support
[04:09.96]to a president-elect because of a vote recount that took place in Florida.
[04:16.48]That recount was finalized on December 13.
[04:20.92]That gave the team of incoming President George W. Bush
[04:25.24]less time and support ahead of Bush's first day in office.
[04:31.48]An official report said the shortened transition period
[04:35.68]made the nation less prepared for the September 11 terror attacks
[04:41.20]that took place in Bush's first year in office.
