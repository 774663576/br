。
[00:01.80]General Electric, a company known simply as GE
[00:06.04]to generations of Americans, announced Tuesday
[00:10.28]it will split into three companies.
[00:14.08]GE will become three companies dealing with aviation,
[00:18.16]healthcare and energy over the next few years.
[00:23.68]The company, based in Boston,
[00:25.92]has been changing in recent years.
[00:29.40]In the 1990s, it had become a huge international company
[00:34.36]made up of many businesses
[00:36.52]that sold many different kinds of products.
[00:40.48]GE not only sold light bulbs and home electrical devices,
[00:45.76]but it also provided loans for airplanes and property.
[00:51.40]However, its loan business was heavily damaged
[00:54.76]by the financial crisis of 2008
[00:57.76]and the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.
[01:02.84]GE no longer makes light bulbs or home devices
[01:07.40]and stopped the loan business in March of this year.
[01:12.60]GE said it will separate its healthcare business in early 2023
[01:18.56]and its energy business, including renewable energy,
[01:23.80]power and digital operations in early 2024.
[01:30.32]Lawrence Culp, Jr. is the head of GE.
[01:34.52]He said in a statement, "By creating three industry-leading,
[01:39.84]global public companies, each can benefit."
[01:44.76]He added that it would be better for customers,
[01:47.92]investors and employees.
[01:51.72]Culp will become chairman of the healthcare company.
[01:56.32]Peter Arduini will serve as chief executive
[02:00.28]of GE Healthcare as of January 1, 2022.
[02:06.68]Scott Strazik will become chief
[02:09.16]of the combined renewable energy,
[02:11.80]power, and digital business.
[02:15.48]Culp will lead the aviation business along with John Slattery,
[02:19.72]who will remain its chief executive officer.
[02:24.28]GE will keep an interest in part of the healthcare business.
[02:29.52]Aviation is the most profitable part of GE's business.
[02:34.56]The company produces jet engines, flight systems,
[02:38.68]replacement parts and maintenance services for aircraft.
[02:44.84]The company has spent years becoming smaller
[02:48.28]since it had expanded in the 1980s and 1990s.
[02:54.08]During the late-1990s growth period, GE's rising stock price
[03:00.04]made it the most valuable company in the world.
[03:04.72]However, the financial crises of 2007-2008
[03:10.76]showed that the lending business of GE was at risk of failing.
[03:16.88]In 2015, GE announced a big change for the company.
[03:21.44]It promised to sell off many parts of its business
[03:25.40]to give more attention to power, aviation,
[03:29.44]renewable energy and healthcare.
[03:33.20]That led to some changes in leadership.
[03:36.40]The company said Tuesday that it expects the split
[03:40.56]to cost about $2 billion.
[03:44.36]The board of directors must approve those costs.
[03:47.92]The roots of General Electric go back
[03:52.20]to the famous American inventor Thomas Edison
[03:56.48]who started the company in 1892.
