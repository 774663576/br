。
[00:00.04]Where is the line between art and advertising?
[00:04.00]The question is central to a big dispute
[00:08.00]in a small American town.
[00:10.64]A large painting in Conway, New Hampshire,
[00:14.16]has led to a zoning conflict,
[00:16.64]a First Amendment legal action
[00:19.28]and a local vote.
[00:22.32]It started with a high school art project
[00:25.36]to paint a picture on a building in the town.
[00:29.36]The building houses a store
[00:31.92]called Leavitt's Country Bakery.
[00:34.24]The picture shows the sun
[00:36.88]shining over mountains  of chocolate
[00:39.40]and strawberry donuts,
[00:41.44]a cinnamon roll and a blueberry muffin.
[00:44.72]These are the kinds of sweet treats
[00:48.04]found in bakeries.
[00:50.64]Then the town zoning board got involved.
[00:53.88]It decided that the painting
[00:56.44]was more advertising than art.
[00:59.40]Officials said that, as an advertisement,
[01:03.00]the sign was too big.
[01:05.24]Its size violated town rules.
[01:09.00]The board ordered the sign
[01:10.84]be removed or changed.
[01:14.16]Bakery owner Sean Young faced possible fines
[01:18.36]if he did not follow the order.
[01:20.72]So, he decided to fight it in court.
[01:24.00]Young's legal action
[01:26.32]accuses the town of Conway
[01:28.84]of violating his right to free speech,
[01:31.80]guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.
[01:36.16]"They said it would be art elsewhere,"
[01:38.56]Young told The Associated Press.
[01:41.20]"It's just not art here.
[01:44.44]"The town should not have the right
[01:46.60]to police art," he said.
[01:49.80]The dispute has the town of 10,000 people
[01:53.72]debating big questions
[01:55.40]about creativity and freedom.
[01:58.72]Conway is in the White Moutains,
[02:01.80]a popular area with visitors.
[02:05.04]The town is under pressure
[02:07.28]to increase business development.
[02:09.60]Some residents worry that
[02:12.16]compromises with development interests
[02:15.12]will lead to unwanted changes to their town.
[02:19.68]Many, including the zoning board members,
[02:22.96]liked the students' work.
[02:24.72]But they said rules must be followed.
[02:28.20]At about 8.6 square meters,
[02:31.68]the mural is four times bigger
[02:34.28]than zoning rules permit
[02:36.24]for advertising signs.
[02:39.76]At town meetings,
[02:41.28]residents discussed how to define a sign.
[02:44.92]Then, last week,
[02:46.96]they voted against changes to the rules.
[02:50.24]The local newspaper said
[02:52.36]the wording of the proposed changes
[02:54.84]was not clear.
[02:56.32]A judge may have to make the final decision
[02:59.92]on what remains an open debate in town.
[03:04.52]The lawsuit Young filed in January
[03:07.52]asks that the court prevent the town
[03:10.68]from enforcing its sign law.
[03:14.04]Other businesses have entered into the dispute.
[03:17.80]Long before the painting over Leavitt's,
[03:21.56]Conway had permitted other paintings
[03:24.00]at a local shopping center.
[03:26.00]But in December
[03:28.12]the town found that three of those pictures
[03:31.52]also violate size limits.
[03:34.36]The issue went before
[03:36.68]the zoning board Wednesday.
[03:39.92]The lawsuit argues
[03:41.60]that the town's definition of "sign"
[03:44.96]is very general
[03:47.00]and its zoning rules
[03:48.88]do not include the word "mural."
[03:52.80]Board member Luigi Bartolomeo
[03:55.96]said he thinks the painting
[03:57.64]at the bakery is art, not advertising.
[04:01.40]"I think it's a very badly
[04:03.84]written piece of code here,"
[04:05.48]said Bartolomeo, who recently retired.
[04:09.72]But Board Chairperson John Colbath
[04:12.88]said the board has to work with the rule,
[04:16.20]which was approved by voters.
[04:18.36]He argues that
[04:20.16]the mural would likely be seen as art,
[04:23.08]and not advertising,
[04:24.96]if its subject
[04:26.52]did not represent the products found at Leavitt's.
[04:30.88]The town and Young agreed in February
[04:34.16]to suspend all legal action
[04:36.56]until a vote on a proposed definition.
[04:39.72]The proposal failed.
[04:42.12]The judge now wants to hear
[04:43.92]from both sides by May 10.
[04:47.28]"We're ready to keep going," Young said.
