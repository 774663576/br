<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:TPP Nations Seek to Save Trade Deal after US Withdraws]

。
[00:00.04]Members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
[00:06.32]are seeking to move forward with the trade agreement
[00:10.52]after the United States withdrew.
[00:14.64]President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday
[00:20.08]pulling the United States out of the TPP.
[00:25.64]Leaders from some TPP nations pledged Tuesday to make attempts
[00:32.12]to continue the agreement  even without the U.S.
[00:38.28]Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said
[00:42.72]he had discussed the TPP's future with the leaders of Japan, Singapore and New Zealand.
[00:51.44]He told reporters that while the U.S. leaving was clearly "a big loss,"
[00:58.88]he is hopeful the trade deal will survive.
[01:04.12]The United States negotiated the TPP
[01:08.32]under former President Barack Obama.
[01:12.20]But the deal faced opposition in the U.S. Congress,
[01:17.08]which never approved the deal.
[01:20.88]Turnbull added that with America now out of the agreement,
[01:25.84]"Certainly there is potential for China to join the TPP."
[01:32.76]The Obama administration had said one goal of the TPP
[01:37.92]was to counter China's growing regional influence in the Asia-Pacific.
[01:45.20]In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokeswoman
[01:49.24]would not say whether China would now attempt to join the TPP.
[01:56.56]She said China believes that all nations "should keep going down the path of open,
[02:03.84]inclusive, continuous" economic development.
[02:08.68]In the past, China has proposed an alternative to the TPP,
[02:15.60]a trade group called the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).
[02:24.60]The foreign ministry spokeswoman said efforts to form the FTAAP should now be increased.
[02:34.92]China has also supported another group,
[02:39.04]the Southeast Asian-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
[02:47.84]Analysts say other nations may now seek to join alternative trade agreements
[02:54.88]to take advantage of the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP.
[03:01.32]Trump's rejection of the TPP was expected.
[03:06.40]He repeatedly condemned the agreement during his presidential campaign,
[03:12.76]saying it was not a fair trade deal for America.
[03:18.80]Trump has said he favors one-on-one agreements with other nations
[03:24.28]rather than multinational deals like the TPP.
[03:30.68]Carl Thayer is a political scientist at Australia's University of New South Wales.
[03:39.04]He said he believes America's withdrawal from the TPP
[03:45.00]will greatly reduce Washington's influence in the region.
[03:50.48]"At the moment he (Trump) has given away multilateral (agreements)
[03:52.76]so the U.S. has no longer a leadership role using the economic lever in Southeast Asia."
[03:58.84]There are 11 remaining TPP members,
[04:02.84]including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.
[04:11.56]The others are Canada, Mexico, Chile, Peru and Brunei.
[04:19.96]A Malaysian government trade official said
[04:23.04]the remaining TPP countries would meet in the near future
[04:27.56]to discuss what steps to take next.
[04:32.52]The official said there are still "many possibilities"
[04:36.80]for the remaining 11 nations to push ahead with the TPP.
[04:43.36]Last week, Japan's parliament approved the TPP.
[04:48.44]But Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said that without the U.S., it would become "meaningless."
[04:59.16]On Tuesday, Abe told lawmakers during a parliamentary debate
[05:04.88]he still had hope that Trump might change his position.
[05:10.44]He said he plans to seek Trump's "understanding" on the importance of the TPP.
[05:17.76]Abe added that he plans to meet with Trump as soon as possible.
