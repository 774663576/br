[00:08.20]And now, Words and Their Stories from VOA Learning English.
[00:15.04]Today, we discuss the word board.
[00:22.84]As a noun, board has a couple of meanings.
[00:28.60]It can be a long thick piece of wood
[00:32.08]or other strong material – like a diving board.
[00:37.52]A board can also be a group of people
[00:40.72]who make decisions for an organization.
[00:44.24]An example is a board of directors.
[00:49.36]As a verb, board means several things.
[00:54.12]Board can mean providing food for someone regularly.
[00:58.96]For example, a college student's costs include
[01:03.60]housing and food, called room and board.
[01:09.40]Board can also mean closing off parts of a building with pieces of wood.
[01:15.96]Sometimes in scary movies, people board up
[01:20.00]the doors and windows to keep monsters from entering.
[01:26.00]Board, on board, and aboard are all used differently.
[01:32.72]At a train station, we sometimes hear a conductor say,
[01:36.88]"All aboard," as the train is getting ready to leave.
[01:41.92]And the captain of a ship might say,
[01:45.12]"Welcome aboard," as you climb on the boat.
[01:49.72]However, we say you board a plane, train, or boat when you get on it.
[01:56.76]And we say you are on board once you get on.
[02:02.60]If you agree with an idea or a process,
[02:06.60]we also say that you are on board with it.
[02:11.00]But we never say you are aboard with it.
[02:16.28]And if you are very excited about an idea or process,
[02:21.20]you do not just get on board, you jump on board!
[02:27.16]We also use the term onboarding
[02:30.28]to describe the process of starting a new job.
[02:34.44]This is the process in which new workers learn about a company,
[02:39.88]work rules, and things related to the job.
[02:45.32]At VOA Learning English and many other organizations,
[02:49.88]all workers are required to attend onboarding and other training.
[02:55.96]So, we say the training requirement affects everyone across the board.
[03:02.44]We use the expression across the board
[03:05.44]when something affects every part
[03:08.36]or every individual within a larger group.
[03:12.44]For example, when the government raises taxes on all income levels,
[03:18.48]it affects everyone across the board.
[03:23.24]Experts say, across the board comes from a horse-racing bet.
[03:29.32]It means the same amount is bet for a horse to come in first,
[03:34.16]second, and third in a race.
[03:38.44]And that's all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories.
[03:42.88]We hope you are on board with the expressions
[03:46.16]and use them in your next English conversation!
[03:50.24]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.
