美国越来越多州要求学生接受个人理财教育才能完成高中学业。与此同时，各州希望提高美国学生的数学技能。</p>
<p>Capital City Public Charter School in Washington, D.C. has a course called Advanced Algebra with Financial Applications. The school has offered the math class for more than 10 years. The class provides students with basic knowledge about money management and helps them sharpen their math skills. Classes discuss credit, investments, and loans, for example, and connect these ideas with methods of math for calculating interest, budgeting and more.
华盛顿特区首都公立特许学校开设了一门名为“高级代数与金融应用”的课程。这所学校开设这门数学课程已有10多年了。该课程为学生提供有关资金管理的基本知识，并帮助他们提高数学技能。例如，课程讨论信贷、投资和贷款，并将这些想法与计算利息、预算等的数学方法联系起来。</p>
<p>The high school may be a leader in providing financial education, but in recent years, many others have offered similar courses.<br/>
这所高中可能是提供金融教育的领导者，但近年来，许多其他学校也开设了类似的课程。</p>
<p>Since 2020, nine U.S. states have passed laws or policies requiring schools to provide personal finance education before students can graduate from high school. The U.S. non-profit organization, Council for Economic Education, says 30 states now have such policies in place.<br/>
自2020年以来，美国九个州通过了法律或政策，要求学校在学生高中毕业前提供个人理财教育。美国非营利组织经济教育委员会表示，目前已有30个州制定了此类政策。</p>

托尼卡·泰特姆-戈麦斯这所华盛顿学校教授这门课程。她说，当学生们看到数学与他们未来的经济状况之间的联系时，他们会对数学更感兴趣。</p>

泰特姆-戈麦斯说：“学生们开始明白，‘是的，我需要学习小数，我需要学会分数，我需要学百分比，因为我必须管理我的资金，我必须取得贷款。’”</p>
<p>Supporters say personal finance courses help students learn how to make smart money decisions and develop an interest in math as a result.<br/>
支持者表示，个人理财课程有助于学生学习如何做出明智的理财决策，并因此培养对数学的兴趣。</p>

爱达荷州是实施新的金融知识要求的州之一。</p>

。
[00:00.04]An increasing number of American states
[00:03.28]are requiring that students
[00:05.44]receive personal finance education
[00:08.36]in order to complete high school.
[00:10.76]At the same time,
[00:12.92]states are hoping to improve math skills
[00:16.28]among students in the United States.
[00:20.28]Capital City Public Charter School
[00:22.76]in Washington, D.C. has a course
[00:25.32]called Advanced Algebra with Financial Applications.
[00:30.12]The school has offered the math class
[00:32.96]for more than 10 years.
[00:34.96]The class provides students
[00:37.52]with basic knowledge about money management
[00:40.76]and helps them sharpen their math skills.
[00:44.64]Classes discuss credit, investments, and loans, for example,
[00:49.96]and connect these ideas with methods of math
[00:53.76]for calculating interest, budgeting and more.
[00:58.80]The high school may be a leader
[01:01.04]in providing financial education,
[01:03.48]but in recent years,
[01:05.16]many others have offered similar courses.
[01:09.40]Since 2020, nine U.S. states have passed laws or policies
[01:15.16]requiring schools to provide personal finance education
[01:19.84]before students can graduate from high school.
[01:23.64]The U.S. non-profit organization,
[01:26.64]Council for Economic Education,
[01:29.68]says 30 states now have such policies in place.
[01:35.64]The increase comes as educators
[01:38.28]are trying to improve students' math skills,
[01:41.68]which dropped during the pandemic
[01:44.52]and have not fully recovered.
[01:46.72]At the same time,
[01:48.84]a general dislike or disinterest for math
[01:52.60]remains a barrier among young people.
[01:58.12]Tonica Tatum-Gormes
[02:00.20]teaches the course at the Washington school.
[02:04.00]She said students get more interested in math
[02:07.32]when they see how it connects
[02:09.16]with their future financial well-being.
[02:13.32]Students begin to understand that
[02:15.88]"‘yes, I need to learn decimals,
[02:18.72]and I need to learn fractions,
[02:21.00]and I need to learn percentages
[02:23.36]because I have to manage my money
[02:26.12]and I have to take out a loan,'" Tatum-Gormes said.
[02:31.20]Supporters say personal finance courses
[02:35.00]help students learn how to make smart money decisions
[02:39.28]and develop an interest in math as a result.
[02:45.24]The Council for Economic Education
[02:48.40]says financial education
[02:50.92]should include exploring subjects like earning,
[02:54.84]budgeting, saving, investing,
[02:58.08]and managing credit and financial risk.
[03:01.56]Experts say the class does not have to be taught
[03:05.96]by a traditional math teacher.
[03:10.24]Idaho is one of the states
[03:12.68]where a new financial literacy requirement is in place.
[03:18.24]The new program will give students the chance
[03:21.68]to use skills from their algebra, calculus,
[03:25.48]and economics classes in real life.
[03:29.64]In the class, they will calculate their future student loans,
[03:34.12]rent payments, and income requirements.
[03:39.12]Experts say the 2007-2008 financial crisis,
[03:44.44]pandemic-linked economic insecurity
[03:47.52]and current high inflation
[03:50.00]may have increased Americans' desire
[03:52.84]for stronger financial knowledge.
[03:56.00]Less than one-fourth of millennials
[03:58.76]show basic financial literacy,
[04:01.40]the Council for Economic Education says.
[04:06.16]In 2020, the American civil rights group, NAACP,
[04:10.84]released a resolution calling for more
[04:14.08]financial literacy programs in K-12 schools.

[04:42.48]That figure rises to 14.2 percent
[04:46.36]for schools with less than a quarter of students
[04:49.92]identifying as Black or Hispanic.
[04:54.04]That lack of fairness is a driving force behind
[04:58.04]the financial literacy course
[05:00.20]at Capital City Public Charter School.
[05:03.00]It serves a student population
[05:06.32]that is 64 percent Latino and 25 percent Black.
