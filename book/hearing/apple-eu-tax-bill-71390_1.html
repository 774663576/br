。
[00:00.16]After a two-year investigation,
[00:03.36]the European Union (EU) says the American company Apple
[00:09.28]must pay over $14 billion in back taxes to Ireland.
[00:17.56]The EU's competition commissioner said the company
[00:22.52]did not pay enough in taxes between 2003 and 2014.
[00:30.46]She questioned how anyone might think that Apple's
[00:35.80]2014 Irish tax rate of five thousandths of one percent was fair.
[00:45.56]The European Commission is responsible
[00:49.16]for making official decisions for the European Union.
[00:54.76]The Commission follows rules designed
[00:57.66]to make sure businesses in Europe compete fairly.
[01:02.52]In late August, the Commission announced
[01:06.08]that it would attempt to recover the back taxes from Apple.
[01:11.36]It said the company reported earnings for all of the computers,
[01:17.28]computer tablets and mobile phones it sold in Europe
[01:23.09]through its office in Ireland.
[01:26.24]Because of a tax deal with the Irish government,
[01:30.12]Apple never had to pay much tax on its earnings.
[01:35.44]The Competition Commission is not only investigating Apple.
[01:41.20]It is looking at deals between European countries
[01:45.52]and major international businesses
[01:49.00]including Starbucks, Fiat, Amazon and McDonald's.
[01:56.36]Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook denies the EU allegations.
[02:04.48]He said Apple paid $400 million in taxes in 2014,
[02:11.80]and his company paid more in taxes than any other business in Ireland.
[02:18.92]The tax bill is not only causing concerns in Ireland and Europe.
[02:24.96]Government officials in the United States are also worried.
[02:30.08]Josh Earnest is the spokesman for President Barack Obama.
[02:35.96]He said Americans could be hurt by the EU's ruling
[02:40.80]if Apple is required to make the payment.
[02:45.36]He said the company then could legally reduce
[02:49.52]the billions of dollars it pays Ireland from the U.S. taxes it owes.
[02:56.28]Earnest said the Obama administration is concerned
[03:01.04]EU officials decided to rule against Apple
[03:05.36]without first talking to the U.S. government.
[03:09.36]The U.S Treasury Department called the EU's decision unfair.
[03:15.24]It claimed the EU was targeting American companies for punishment recently.
[03:23.08]The commission denied that allegation.
[03:27.56]On September 1, Tim Cook told an Irish newspaper
[03:32.88]that Apple would work with Irish officials to overturn Europe's decision.
[03:39.72]He also said the tax ruling was politically motivated.
[03:45.00]The European Commission said Ireland offered Apple the low tax rates
[03:51.04]in order to save thousands of Apple jobs within the country.
[03:56.24]It called the deal, "illegal."
[03:59.32]Ireland's Minister of Finance, Michael Noonan,
[04:03.40]said his country will appeal the commission's ruling.
[04:08.40]But if the tax is paid, it would be the largest ever in Europe.
[04:14.00]I'm Dan Friedell.
