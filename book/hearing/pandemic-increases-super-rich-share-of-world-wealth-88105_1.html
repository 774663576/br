。
[00:00.04]A study found on Tuesday
[00:02.44]that the share of household wealth owned by billionaires
[00:07.16]has risen by a record amount during the pandemic.
[00:13.00]Millionaires are also coming out of COVID-19 ahead.
[00:19.00]The World Inequality Report
[00:21.84]is produced by a network of social scientists.
[00:27.04]The report estimated that billionaires this year
[00:31.44]collectively own 3.5 percent of the world household wealth.
[00:38.96]This is up from a little more than 2 percent
[00:42.72]at the start of the pandemic in early 2020.
[00:48.36]Lucas Chancel was the lead writer.
[00:52.28]He said the COVID crisis has worsened the inequalities
[00:57.92]between the very rich and the rest of the population.
[01:03.72]He noted that rich economies used massive financial support
[01:09.76]to lessen the increased rise in poverty seen elsewhere.
[01:16.32]The report used different specialist research and public information.
[01:24.24]The opening part was written by U.S.-based economists
[01:29.24]Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.
[01:34.56]They were two of three economists
[01:37.92]who won a 2019 Nobel for work on poverty.
[01:44.52]They wrote, "wealth is a major source of future economic gains,
[01:50.60]and increasingly, of power and influence...,"
[01:55.28]which predicts even more increases in inequality.
[02:01.20]They were writing about what they called
[02:04.04]an "extreme concentration of economic power
[02:08.64]in the hands of a very small minority of the super-rich."
[02:15.12]The findings confirm what many different existing studies,
[02:20.44]"rich lists," and other evidence found,
[02:24.32]pointing to a rise in health, social, sex,
[02:29.32]and racial inequalities during the pandemic.
[02:34.80]Forbes magazine publishes yearly a list of the world's billionaires.
[02:42.12]This year it includes a record-breaking 2,755 billionaires
[02:51.16]with a combined worth of $13.1 trillion, up from $8 trillion last year.
[03:02.88]The new report showed that a wider group of 520,000 adults
[03:09.88]who make up the top 0.01 percent richest together
[03:16.80]saw their share of global wealth hit 11 percent this year.
[03:23.92]This is up from 10 percent the year before.
[03:28.64]It said belonging to the top 0.01 percent richest
[03:35.68]means having a household wealth of at least $19 million.
[03:43.24]This was set for different amounts
[03:46.08]among different countries based on what a dollar could buy.
[03:52.12]Researchers say some super-rich have gained from the move
[03:56.88]to online of much of the world's economy during lockdowns.
[04:03.20]Others simply gained from the value of what they owned,
[04:07.76]which raised as financial markets
[04:10.72]put money into the recovery of the economy.
[04:15.64]The study also found that poverty greatly increased
[04:20.88]in countries with weaker government support.
[04:25.68]It found that large government support in the United States
[04:30.80]and Europe was able to deal
[04:34.28]with at least some of the effects on lower earners there.
[04:39.80]Chancel said, "This shows the importance
[04:43.76]of social status in the fight against poverty."
