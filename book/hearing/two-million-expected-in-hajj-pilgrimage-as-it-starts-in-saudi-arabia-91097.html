。
[00:00.04]Over 2 million Muslims are gathered in the Islamic holy city of Mecca,
[00:07.32]Saudi Arabia, for this year's hajj pilgrimage, or religious trip.
[00:14.80]The pilgrimage has returned to the usual level of participation
[00:20.40]for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
[00:26.40]The pilgrims made their way out of Mecca on Monday
[00:30.44]after circling Islam's holiest site, the Kaaba.
[00:36.08]They are gathering in the nearby desert for a day and night of prayer.
[00:42.60]The pilgrimage is one of the five pillars,
[00:46.32]or central beliefs, of Islam.
[00:50.24]The Quran, Islam's holy book,
[00:53.20]says that all Muslims who are physically and financially able
[00:58.56]should make the pilgrimage once in their lifetime.
[01:03.60]It takes place over five days.
[01:06.96]The hajj follows a path
[01:09.56]that Muslims believe their prophet Muhammad
[01:12.92]walked almost 1,400 years ago.
[01:17.96]The holy walk is seen as a uniting event
[01:22.08]for the world's 1.8 billion Muslims.
[01:27.00]Some people spend years saving up money to pay for the trip.
[01:32.88]Pilgrims have been circling the Kaaba
[01:35.56]since arriving in Mecca over recent days.
[01:40.44]As the last ones performed it Monday,
[01:43.44]the pilgrims made their way by foot or by bus to Mina.
[01:49.32]They will camp there in one of the largest tent cities in the world.
[01:55.24]Mina is a large open space
[01:58.20]with little to protect people from the sun and intense heat.
[02:04.16]Soldiers cooled pilgrims with water.
[02:07.84]Egyptian businessmen Yehya Al-Ghanam
[02:12.40]said he was at a loss for words
[02:15.24]to describe his feelings on arriving at Mina.
[02:19.84]He said, "Tears will fall from my eyes out of joy and happiness."
[02:26.44]Pilgrims pray throughout the day and night
[02:29.64]before traveling on Tuesday to Mount Arafat.
[02:34.56]That is where Muhammad is said to have given his final speech.
[02:40.84]After Arafat, the pilgrims collect small rocks
[02:45.12]from a place known as Muzdalifa.
[02:49.08]They then return to Mina to throw the rocks
[02:52.12]at three stone walls that represent evil.
[02:56.80]This is the final act of the hajj.
[03:00.36]Then, Muslims begin celebrating
[03:03.52]the three-day long holiday of Eid al-Adha,
[03:07.84]or Feast of Sacrifice.
