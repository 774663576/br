<p>In 2003, researchers announced the first genome <strong>sequence</strong> that accounted for over 90 percent of the complete human genome.

。
[00:00.04]Scientists recently released a new accounting of the human genome.
[00:07.00]The research effort included information
[00:10.76]from people from around the world
[00:13.80]and could help ongoing efforts
[00:16.52]to identify genetic causes of diseases.
[00:20.68]A genome is an organism's genetic map
[00:24.68]and contains the information needed for development and growth.
[00:30.12]Each person's genome is individual,
[00:33.96]differing only from all others by about 0.4 percent on average.
[00:40.64]Scientists have made big advances
[00:44.68]in understanding the human genome in the past twenty years.
[00:50.12]In 2003, researchers announced the first genome sequence
[00:56.16]that accounted for over 90 percent of the complete human genome.
[01:02.16]It included information from about 20 people,
[01:07.00]but 70 percent of the blood donated for the research
[01:11.56]came from one individual of mixed European and African ancestry.
[01:18.88]The first complete human genome,
[01:21.64]based on one European person, was published last year.
[01:27.40]The Human Pangenome Project builds upon this body of work.
[01:32.92]A pangenome is a collection of diverse genomes.
[01:38.52]Scientists describe it as a rainbow of genomes,
[01:43.24]compared with one line representing the older,
[01:46.76]single reference genome.
[01:49.52]The collection is designed
[01:51.56]to represent the genetic diversity of the human species.
[01:56.64]By comparing the "genomes
[01:59.00]we can then build a map of not just one individual,
[02:03.40]but a whole population of variation,"
[02:06.60]said Benedict Paten of the University of California, Santa Cruz.
[02:12.92]Paten was the senior writer of the main research paper
[02:17.92]that reported the findings in Nature.
[02:22.12]The pangenome contains material from 24 people of African ancestry,
[02:28.88]16 from the Americas and the Caribbean,
[02:32.96]six from Asia and one from Europe.
[02:37.72]The group leading the research
[02:39.96]is part of the Human Genome Reference Program,
[02:43.88]which is financed by an arm of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
[02:50.76]Our species, Homo sapiens, developed in Africa
[02:55.68]roughly 300,000 years ago and later spread worldwide.
[03:01.92]"Human ancestry is incredibly complex,
[03:05.64]and we're all related to each other
[03:08.16]through our common history," said Ira Hall,
[03:11.76]director of the Yale Center for Genomic Health
[03:15.96]and one of the research leaders.
[03:19.36]Hall added, "And so by sampling broadly
[03:22.96]across the genetic tree of humanity, it benefits everybody."
[03:28.36]The new genome research could deepen understanding
[03:32.52]about how genetic variation is linked to health and disease.
[03:38.44]It could also improve genetic testing and guide drug discovery.
[03:44.52]Candice Hirsch of the University of Minnesota
[03:48.72]was not involved in the research but has closely followed the effort.
[03:54.36]She said she expects many discoveries to flow from it.
[03:59.36]Until now, "we really have only been able to scratch the surface
[04:04.68]of understanding the genetics that underlies disease," she added.
[04:10.56]It may take a while for patients to see benefits from the research.
[04:16.48]But scientists said new findings
[04:19.80]should help make genetic testing more exact
[04:23.40]and possibly lead to drug discoveries.
[04:27.04]The research team is in the process
[04:30.28]of adding to the collection of reference genomes.
[04:34.72]The group aims to have sequences from 350 people
[04:39.96]by the middle of next year.
[04:43.20]Scientists are also hoping to work more with international partners,
[04:48.64]including those centered on Indigenous populations.
