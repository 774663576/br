<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Striking Writers Announce Deal with Hollywood Producers]

。
[00:00.04]The Writers Guild of America (WGA) said Sunday
[00:05.44]that it had reached an agreement
[00:07.96]with Hollywood movie and television studios.
[00:11.76]The announcement signaled
[00:14.12]that the group's five-month strike is nearing an end.
[00:18.88]The WGA is the labor group
[00:21.36]that represents writers in the United States
[00:24.72]who work on many movies and television programs.
[00:28.76]The writers' group said its members
[00:31.24]will not yet return to work, but they will no longer protest –
[00:36.00]or picket – outside movie studios.
[00:40.00]The WGA said it reached an agreement
[00:43.52]with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television producers
[00:48.40]for a tentative three-year deal.
[00:51.40]It is called "tentative," which means not certain,
[00:55.92]because it must still be approved
[00:58.68]by the WGA's leaders and members.
[01:02.08]A vote could happen this week.
[01:05.80]The WGA said its labor stoppage
[01:09.12]lasted more than 140 days.
[01:13.20]If it had gone five days longer,
[01:15.92]the strike would have been the longest in WGA history.
[01:21.00]When the new contract is approved,
[01:24.00]programs that depend on writers who have not been working
[01:29.12]could be back on television within days.
[01:32.44]Those include nightly comedy programs
[01:35.36]such as The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon
[01:38.56]and Jimmy Kimmel Live!.
[01:41.68]The news made some media experts think
[01:44.76]the actors' group – known as SAG-AFTRA –
[01:48.60]could be close to ending its strike.
[01:51.48]SAG-AFTRA congratulated the WGA
[01:55.20]on reaching its agreement.
[01:57.48]It used words such as "strength,
[02:00.60]resiliency and solidarity" to describe the writers' group's decision
[02:06.72]to hold out for a good deal.
[02:08.96]SAG-AFTRA added, "We remain committed
[02:12.72]to achieving the necessary terms for our members."
[02:17.04]It also said it wants the studio leaders to "return to the table
[02:22.00]and make a fair deal that our members deserve and demand."
[02:25.68]The writers and studio heads made their agreement
[02:30.00]without intervention from government officials.
[02:33.28]That has happened in the past.
[02:35.92]State and local government leaders
[02:38.96]congratulated the two groups on their new plan.
[02:42.24]California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was "grateful
[02:46.24]the two sides have come together."
[02:48.80]One of the main issues that caused the strike
[02:52.60]was how writers are paid by streaming video services
[02:56.80]such as Netflix.
[02:59.20]Another issue was the use of artificial intelligence technology
[03:04.32]in the creation of scripts.
[03:07.52]The strike stopped production
[03:09.44]on a number of daily television programs
[03:12.20]and delayed upcoming television shows and movies
[03:16.20]that had been planned for production.
[03:19.88]The writers started their strike on May 2.
[03:23.52]Film and television actors stopped working on July 14.
[03:29.88]The two groups had not gone on strike
[03:32.40]at the same time since 1960.
[03:35.64]I'm Dan Friedell.
