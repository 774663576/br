<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Vietnam Sees Trade Deals as Way to Build Economy]

。
[00:00.01]Vietnam is on a path this year to approve its biggest trade expansion
[00:06.43] since the country joined the World Trade Organization (WTO).
[00:11.58]The country's National Assembly in Hanoi approved the Comprehensive 
[00:18.39]and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership in December. 
[00:25.49]The trade deal became effective on January 14.
[00:32.06]The Pacific trade deal would open the markets of Japan 
[00:37.47]and Canada to Vietnam's products. 
[00:42.02]In addition, the deal will permit Vietnamese
[00:46.16] to enter 10 countries easily for work-related business.
[00:52.26]Vietnam also is seeking to reach a trade agreement with the European Union soon. 
[01:01.18]The two trade agreements together would sharply reduce trade barriers 
[01:07.98]with countries that account for 45 percent of the world's economy.
[01:15.27]Lawmakers of other countries in the Pacific partnership
[01:20.89] are in the process of approving the deal. 
[01:25.42]Six countries have already approved it 
[01:28.56]meaning that it is likely to legally go into effect.
[01:34.78]Vietnam hopes that the EU approves this year the free trade deal 
[01:42.16]which the two sides negotiated in 2015.
[01:47.69]Experts say that the two major trade deals 
[01:51.96]will speed growth of the country's growing middle class. 
[01:57.46]They also help Vietnam compete with China as a place 
[02:03.92]where international companies want to build factories.
[02:09.24]Frederick Burke is with the international law group Baker McKenzie in Ho Chi Minh City. 
[02:19.11]He said, "Vietnam will enjoy a comparatively lower duty rate
[02:25.96] in some export markets where it competes."
[02:30.90]Burke added that foreign direct investment already 
[02:36.52]has increased as much as it did when Vietnam joined the WTO. 
[02:44.16]When foreign companies build factories and gain interest 
[02:49.76]in a country's companies, it is called foreign direct investment.
[02:56.44]Vietnam may be one of the nations that gain the most from the Comprehensive 
[03:03.55]and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership.
[03:08.45] That is because exports are such an important part of the country's growth.
[03:15.99] Exports are estimated to have reached $200 billion in 2017. 
[03:24.66]Other countries in the Pacific deal are expected to have trade deficits with Vietnam.
[03:32.83]Since 1986, Vietnam has sought foreign direct investment
[03:41.23] in factories that make clothing and electronic devices. 
[03:47.83]It entered the WTO in 2007.
[03:53.26]Adam McCarty is chief economist with Mekong Economics in Hanoi. 
[04:02.13]He said, with the new agreement, low-cost manufactured goods like shoes
[04:09.15] will be less costly to export to countries like Australia.
[04:15.25]European and Pacific countries hope trade deals with Vietnam 
[04:21.87]will let them sell products to that country's growing middle class. 
[04:28.32]The Boston Consulting Group predicts 
[04:32.67]that will mean more than 30 million people by next year.
[04:38.84]However, as a member of the trade partnership, 
[04:43.84]Vietnam must permit independent labor unions. 
[04:48.15]Vietnam also must have rules so that companies 
[04:53.89]from partnership countries can make bids for business. 
[04:59.93]And Vietnam will have to protect partners' intellectual property rights.
[05:06.80]McCarty said if Vietnam closely observes the Pacific trade agreement 
[05:14.76]it will further show that it is different from China. 
[05:20.22]Vietnam already stands out for its lower labor costs.
[05:27.35]Trung Nguyen heads international relations
[05:32.64] at Ho Chi Minh University of Social Sciences and Humanities. 
[05:39.52]He said Vietnam wants to follow the deal's rules. 
[05:45.69]"They want (to) get some new momentum for Vietnam's economy, 
[05:52.08]and TPP is one of the solutions," he said.
