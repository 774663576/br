<p>The Super Bowl is the yearly championship game of the National Football League, or NFL. The game is many things. It is usually the most-watched television program of the year.

<p>Sunday will be the 57th Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs are to face each other in Glendale, Arizona. The NFL's 32 member teams played a 17-game season and then top teams competed in playoff games to earn a chance at the championship.</p>
<p>Both teams have long histories and loyal fans. The Chiefs have appeared in the Super Bowl four other times and came away champions in 1970 and 2020.</p>
<p>The Eagles have won the Super Bowl once, in 2018. Sunday will be the team's fourth appearance in the championship.</p>
<p>This year's Super Bowl is getting attention for a special reason. For the first time, Black <strong>quarterbacks</strong> will lead both teams on the field. Eagles <strong>coach </strong>Nick<strong> </strong>Sirianni is happy about that.</p>
<p>"I'm really excited for both quarterbacks, what they can represent to <strong>a ton</strong> of kids," Sirianni said at a media event this week. "They both play at the highest level," he added.</p>

。
[00:00.04]February 12 is not a holiday in the United States,
[00:05.88]but it may seem like one to many Americans
[00:11.00]because of one big game.
[00:15.56]Tens of millions of Americans will gather
[00:18.88]for parties at restaurants and homes around the nation.
[00:24.32]They will enjoy food and drink together.
[00:27.80]Then, these families and friends,
[00:31.36]in groups of all sizes, will settle around televisions.
[00:37.20]It is Super Bowl Sunday in America.
[00:41.84]The Super Bowl is the yearly championship game
[00:45.44]of the National Football League, or NFL.
[00:50.76]The game is many things.
[00:53.80]It is usually the most-watched television program of the year.
[01:00.36]It is the biggest event for television advertisers.
[01:05.56]And halfway through the game,
[01:08.28]play stops for a performance
[01:11.08]from some of the biggest names in the music industry.
[01:15.96]This year it is Rihanna.
[01:18.68]Sunday will be the 57th Super Bowl.
[01:23.72]The Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs
[01:28.00]are to face each other in Glendale, Arizona.
[01:31.68]The NFL's 32 member teams played a 17-game season
[01:39.12]and then top teams competed in playoff games
[01:44.56]to earn a chance at the championship.
[01:48.96]Both teams have long histories and loyal fans.
[01:54.76]The Chiefs have appeared in the Super Bowl four other times
[01:58.96]and came away champions in 1970 and 2020.
[02:05.84]The Eagles have won the Super Bowl once, in 2018.
[02:11.60]Sunday will be the team's fourth appearance in the championship.
[02:17.36]This year's Super Bowl is getting attention for a special reason.
[02:23.40]For the first time, Black quarterbacks will lead both teams on the field.
[02:30.60]Eagles coach Nick Sirianni is happy about that.
[02:35.24]"I'm really excited for both quarterbacks,
[02:38.36]what they can represent to a ton of kids,"
[02:42.24]Sirianni said at a media event this week.
[02:47.28]"They both play at the highest level," he added.
[02:52.44]Patrick Mahomes is the quarterback of the Chiefs.
[02:56.20]He led the team to its most recent Super Bowl championship.
[03:02.16]The 27-year-old football player told reporters
[03:06.52]that this game was important for Black people.
[03:10.12]"I think about it a lot," he said.
[03:13.88]"The quarterbacks that came before me
[03:16.56]— Shack Harris, Doug Williams
[03:19.32]— that laid the foundation for me to be in this position."
[03:24.32]He is also looking to the future.
[03:27.32]"How can we motivate kids who are younger,
[03:30.72]who want to follow their dreams
[03:32.60]to be a quarterback?" Mahomes asked.
[03:36.36]His opponent, Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts,
[03:39.96]also spoke to reporters this week
[03:42.04]about how special this Super Bowl is.
[03:46.40]"So many African American quarterbacks have played this game,
[03:50.84]and for the first time for two to go head-to-head,
[03:55.32]that's uplifting for the next generations of quarterbacks,"
[04:00.04]said the 24-year-old.
[04:02.52]"Texas, Louisiana, wherever across the world,
[04:06.92]regardless of what someone might say
[04:09.40]or have an opinion about you, you can do it, too."
