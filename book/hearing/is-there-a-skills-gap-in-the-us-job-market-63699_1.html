[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]The United States' job market has millions of unfilled jobs. 
[00:05.72]Many of those jobs require technical skills. 
[00:09.53]However, employers say many of those jobs are vacant 
[00:14.89]because they cannot find people with the right skills to do the work. 
[00:20.33]Labor experts call this paradox the "skills gap." 
[00:26.27]A number of efforts have been launched to better understand and solve it.
[00:32.64]Nicholas Wyman wrote a book called, 
[00:36.75]"Job U: How to Find Wealth and Success 
[00:41.02]by Developing the Skills Companies Actually Need." 
[00:45.11]He calls the skills gap, "a labor market mismatch -- 
[00:50.22]people without jobs and jobs without people."
[00:54.96]In the United States, 
[00:57.81]the cost of a traditional four-year college can be very high. 
[01:02.67]U.S. colleges and universities produce many graduates every year. 
[01:09.11]Yet unemployment rates among new graduates are high.
[01:14.01]Nicholas Wyman says a combination of technical classes and on-the-job training -- 
[01:21.06]an apprenticeship --would be a better choice for many people. 
[01:25.41]He notes that, "An apprenticeship is where you learn from a specialist, 
[01:31.15]you are provided mentoring, you learn in an on the job environment, 
[01:36.54]the old cliche is that you are actually paid to earn and learn."
[01:42.98]Mr. Wyman once served as an apprentice himself. 
[01:47.90]He says apprenticeships are misunderstood in the United States, 
[01:53.24]where "success" is often defined as attending a four-year college. 
[01:59.40]But he notes that is changing as on-the-job training has spread outside traditional areas, 
[02:08.46]like construction and manufacturing. 
[02:11.48]He says apprenticeship possibilities are growing in some manufacturing jobs.
[02:18.73]Mr. Wyman also says it is vital to get technical skills 
[02:25.02]that are of immediate value to an employer. 
[02:28.98]He adds that it is important to get transferrable skills -- 
[02:33.63]those that can be used in more than one job. 
[02:37.64]This is because technology and the nature of the workplace 
[02:42.87]are changing at a faster rate than before.
[02:46.37]There are questions about the definition, size, 
[02:51.41]and nature of the skills gap in the labor force. 
[02:55.86]Iowa State University researchers studied some of these questions recently. 
[03:02.88]They examined employment, education and population information, 
[03:08.83]and found the evidence of a skills gap is weak.
[03:12.92]Iowa State's Liesl Eathington noted that many policymakers 
[03:18.98]and employers say there is opportunity in "middle skills" areas, like machining. 
[03:25.64]Yet she said the most recent recession hit some of those job areas hard. 
[03:32.99]She said students should be on guard 
[03:36.34]because "our economy really isn't adding that many jobs 
[03:41.19]that require the middle skills or middle educated territory."
[03:46.56]She said employers could get more well-qualified applicants if they offered higher wages. 
[03:54.98]She noted that graduates of two-year training programs 
[03:59.77]still generally make less money than graduates of four-year colleges.
[04:05.97]The question of finding the right person for the right job remains a difficult one. 
[04:12.53]The Department of Labor says 8.7 million Americans are unemployed 
[04:19.47]and another 6.7 million can find only part-time work.
