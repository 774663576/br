。
[00:02.00]Japanese scientists
[00:03.76]have found a way to attach living skin tissue
[00:06.76]to robotic faces and make them "smile."
[00:11.12]This breakthrough could be helpful
[00:13.12]not only in robotics,
[00:15.08]but also in cosmetics and medicine.
[00:18.48]Researchers at the University of Tokyo
[00:20.92]started the process by growing human skin cells
[00:24.52]in the shape of a face.
[00:27.20]Then, they used attachments
[00:29.24]that are similar to the ligaments in a human
[00:32.36]to pull the tissue into a wide smile.
[00:35.96]Lead researcher Shoji Takeuchi
[00:38.56]is a professor at the University of Tokyo.
[00:42.28]He said the result is an important step
[00:45.04]towards building more life-like robots.
[00:48.64]Using the attachments, he said,
[00:50.56]"it became possible to manipulate
[00:52.92]living skin for the first time."
[00:56.24]The study about the smiling robot
[00:58.40]appeared last month in Cell Reports Physical Science.
[01:03.08]It represents 10 years of research
[01:05.48]by Takeuchi and his lab
[01:07.40]on how to best combine biological
[01:10.16]and artificial machines.
[01:13.28]Living tissue is better for this application
[01:16.00]than metals and plastics, Takeuchi said.
[01:20.04]He noted that brains and muscles
[01:22.36]are more efficient in use of energy
[01:24.68]and the skin can repair itself.
[01:29.04]In the future, the researchers
[01:30.96]aim to add more elements to the lab-grown skin,
[01:34.24]including a circulatory system and nerves.
[01:38.68]That could lead to safer testing methods
[01:41.44]for cosmetics and drugs absorbed,
[01:44.24]or taken in, through the skin.
[01:47.16]It could also produce more realistic
[01:49.68]and functional coverings for robots.
[01:53.48]The remaining issue is how people react
[01:56.12]to machines that appear almost lifelike,
[01:58.60]but do not look exactly like humans.
[02:02.60]"There's still a bit of that creepiness to it,"
[02:05.28]Takeuchi said about the robot.
[02:08.36]He added, "I think that making robots
[02:11.12]out of the same materials as humans
[02:13.56]and having them show the same expressions
[02:16.84]might be one key to overcoming the uncanny valley."
[02:22.00]The "uncanny valley" is an idea
[02:24.20]that relates to how humans react
[02:26.08]to robots or other machines that act like humans.
[02:30.48]"Uncanny" is an adjective that means
[02:32.96]"being beyond what is normal or expected."
[02:37.04]Japanese robotics scientist Masahiro Mori
[02:40.32]published a work, Bukimi No Tani,
[02:43.16]or "Uncanny Valley" in 1970.
[02:47.44]It proposed how people would react
[02:49.64]to lifelike robots, or androids.
[02:53.00]Mori thought that at first,
[02:54.72]people would have positive feelings about robots
[02:57.44]that look a little bit like humans.
[03:00.60]But as robots got closer to being realistic human models,
[03:04.56]he believed those feelings would become more negative.
[03:08.92]Those negative feelings
[03:10.68]are the so-called low point, or "valley,"
[03:13.88]in a chart that represents the relationship
[03:16.96]between the human-like appearance of robots
[03:20.04]and humans' feelings toward and acceptance of such robots.
