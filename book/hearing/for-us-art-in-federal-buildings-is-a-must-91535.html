[00:00.04]Artwork has been a part of federal structures
[00:04.52]almost since the founding of the United States.
[00:09.88]A good example is the U.S. Capitol Building
[00:14.20]with its domed ceiling, paintings and statues.
[00:20.44]And the Washington Monument
[00:22.84]to honor the nation's first president
[00:25.88]was completed in 1888.
[00:30.04]Jennifer Gibson is the director of the Center for Fine Arts
[00:35.20]at the General Services Administration (GSA),
[00:40.88]the agency that supervises federal buildings.
[00:45.80]She says art in federal buildings
[00:49.00]is a record of the past
[00:51.20]and "creates a dynamic presence
[00:54.72]in towns and cities and border stations across the country."
[01:01.24]In the 1960s, a presidential committee stated that "...
[01:06.20]fine art should be incorporated
[01:09.24]into the designs of federal buildings
[01:12.28]with emphasis on the work of living American artists."
[01:18.04]Today, the government still spends about
[01:22.68]0.5 percent of the federal budget
[01:26.08]to commission, or order, new artwork for federal spaces.
[01:33.04]The commissions are decided by a group
[01:36.24]that includes the lead designer of the building,
[01:40.48]those who will occupy the space,
[01:43.52]community members, arts professionals, and the GSA.
[01:49.80]Artists are given details about the building project
[01:53.96]and asked to propose artwork
[01:57.44]they think is best for the space.
[02:01.60]New York artist James Carpenter
[02:04.36]created two artworks for federal buildings.
[02:09.12]They included a ceiling for a courtroom in Phoenix, Arizona,
[02:15.08]and a sculpture for another courthouse in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[02:22.08]Carpenter said, "My work is really about
[02:26.16]how to enhance or influence,
[02:29.60]in a very positive way,
[02:32.16]people's experience of spaces..."
[02:36.44]For some artists, requests to provide art for federal buildings
[02:41.56]may not be related to making money.
[02:45.32]Artists can make commissions as much as
[02:48.24]$1 million from non-government artworks.
[02:53.28]The average commission for art in federal buildings
[02:57.44]is around $100,000.
[03:00.60]And the process can take several years,
[03:04.84]limiting an artist's ability to work on other art projects.
[03:11.32]Carpenter said the Salt Lake City project
[03:14.80]took a total of 12 years.
[03:17.72]"They're looking at it as a way to participate
[03:21.84]in what's going on in the nation
[03:24.52]and to be part of its history," Gibson says.
[03:28.08]"This is for the nation. This is permanent.
[03:32.04]We will take care of it.
[03:33.76]And it's your way to participate."
[03:37.52]The commissioned artworks can be found
[03:40.32]in 428 federal buildings across the country.
[03:46.36]Overall, the GSA's fine art collection
[03:50.64]contains 26,712 works,
[03:56.24]including some that date back to the 1850s.
[04:01.36]Most of the artworks are paintings,
[04:04.60]sculptures and photographs created in the 1930s.
[04:10.52]That was the time the government employed artists
[04:14.40]during the Great Depression.
[04:17.56]The collection belongs to the American people
[04:21.12]as a record of the history of American culture.
