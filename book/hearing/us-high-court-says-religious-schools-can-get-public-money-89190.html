。
[00:00.04]The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state of Maine
[00:04.85]may not bar religious schools from a tuition assistance program.
[00:10.96]The case involved a rule of Maine's Department of Education.
[00:14.94]The rule permits families who live in areas that do not have public schools
[00:20.31]to receive public money to send their children
[00:24.20]to a public or private school of their choosing.
[00:27.44]That program, however, bars the money from going to religious schools.
[00:34.44]Families that want to send their children to religious schools
[00:38.02]say the law violates their religious rights.
[00:43.00]In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled that the Maine program
[00:47.74]violates the Constitution's protections for religious freedoms.
[00:52.92]Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote,
[00:57.78]"The State pays tuition for certain students at private schools —
[01:01.86]so long as the schools are not religious.
[01:05.08]That is discrimination against religion."
[01:09.32]The court's three liberal justices disagreed with the majority decision.
[01:14.46]"This Court continues to dismantle the wall of separation
[01:18.57]between church and state that the Framers fought to build,"
[01:23.12]Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote.
[01:27.24]The ruling is the latest in a line of decisions from the Supreme Court
[01:31.93]that have favored religion-based discrimination claims.
[01:35.88]The court is separately looking at the case of a football coach
[01:40.05]who says he has a First Amendment right to pray at midfield immediately after games.
[01:47.24]The court's decision on Tuesday immediately affects Maine and Vermont,
[01:52.17]a neighboring state with a similar program.
[01:55.05]But the ruling could also fuel a renewed push for school choice programs
[02:01.01]in some of the states that have so far
[02:03.45]not directed public money to private, religious education.
[02:09.16]In the Maine case, two families wanted to send their children to Christian schools
[02:14.27]in Bangor and Waterville.
[02:17.47]The schools, Bangor Christian School and Temple Academy,
[02:21.97]have said in court records that they do not accept gay,
[02:25.76]lesbian or transgender students and teachers.
[02:30.52]At the time, Maine officials said that religious schools
[02:34.48]are excluded from the program "because the education they provide
[02:38.60]is not equivalent to" public education.
[02:42.68]The lawsuit was filed last year following a Supreme Court ruling
[02:47.13]saying that a Missouri program was wrong to deny money
[02:51.17]to a religious school for fixing a playground.
[02:54.40]That ruling opened the door for more cases
[02:58.42]aimed at changing rules about religious schools and public money.
[03:04.48]Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in a case from Montana
[03:08.69]that states do not have to permit public money to be used in private education.
[03:14.06]But they cannot keep religious schools out of such programs, once created.
