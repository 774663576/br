[00:00.28]For many years,
[00:02.32]cups of instant noodles
[00:04.72]have been a favorite
[00:06.44]among Korean Air passengers.
[00:09.88]However, they will no longer be available
[00:13.40]for economy-class travelers
[00:16.28]starting August 15,
[00:18.76]said a spokesperson
[00:20.64]for the Seoul-based airline.
[00:24.56]Korean Air said its decision
[00:27.32]was a safety measure
[00:29.44]to deal with increased turbulence,
[00:33.12]"aimed at preventing burn accidents."
[00:37.92]Turbulence, or irregular movements
[00:41.36]from up and down air currents,
[00:43.88]can cause the hot cups of noodles to spill.
[00:49.08]In addition to regular meals,
[00:52.36]instant noodles are currently part
[00:55.56]of Korean Air's self-service food,
[00:59.28]for economy passengers on long trips.
[01:04.00]In this week's announcement,
[01:06.12]the airline added that it will offer other food items
[01:10.44]for economy travelers.
[01:13.32]The new offerings include
[01:15.76]sandwiches, corn dogs, and hot pockets.
[01:21.52]However, business-class
[01:24.00]and first-class passengers
[01:26.52]will still get their noodles.
[01:29.56]Korean Air told the BBC
[01:32.40]that the noodles are brought individually
[01:35.48]to business-class and first-class travelers.
[01:40.12]This reduces the risk of spills and burns.
[01:46.52]Concern about the dangers
[01:48.80]of serving hot food and liquids
[01:51.32]on airplanes is not new.
[01:55.32]Over the years, several airlines
[01:58.28]have faced legal actions
[02:00.80]from travelers who say they suffered
[02:03.84]serious burns after having hot coffee,
[02:07.52]for example, spilled on them during a flight.
[02:12.92]In 2019, the European Union's
[02:17.16]highest court ruled that an airline
[02:20.52]can be held responsible
[02:22.84]if a passenger is injured in this way.
[02:26.96]This is the case even if turbulence
[02:30.76]or other flight-related reasons
[02:33.68]did not cause the spill.
[02:36.76]But turbulence, of course,
[02:39.36]still adds to the risk.
[02:42.32]Flying through unstable air
[02:44.56]can make balancing something
[02:46.72]like hot soup or drink much more difficult.
[02:51.76]Several turbulence-related injuries
[02:54.68]have been reported over the years.
[02:57.88]But most injuries are minor.
[03:01.36]And airlines have made
[03:03.12]continuous improvements
[03:05.04]in reducing the number of in-flight accidents.
[03:09.88]Those include stopping service
[03:12.84]when needed or taking extra care
[03:16.32]when giving out certain drinks.
[03:19.84]Still, rough air might be getting harder
[03:22.96]and harder to avoid.
[03:25.92]Weather and airline experts note
[03:29.20]increasing reports of turbulence.
[03:33.12]They point to the possible effects
[03:35.92]climate change may have
[03:38.28]on flying conditions.
