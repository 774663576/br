。
[00:00.04]In Pakistan, polio cases are rising
[00:04.32]ahead of a new vaccination campaign.
[00:09.12]Violence targeting health workers
[00:12.36]has also hurt years of efforts
[00:15.32]toward making the country polio-free.
[00:20.32]The World Health Organization says
[00:23.24]polio is a highly infectious disease
[00:26.88]caused by a virus.
[00:30.12]The disease largely affects children
[00:33.36]under age five.
[00:36.12]The virus is transmitted from person to person
[00:40.20]and spread mainly through contact.
[00:44.80]It invades the nervous system
[00:47.44]and causes a person to be unable
[00:50.40]to move arms, legs or muscles,
[00:55.24]a condition called paralysis.
[00:59.20]Among those paralyzed,
[01:01.52]up to 10 percent die
[01:03.80]when their breathing muscles
[01:05.60]become immobilized.
[01:09.04]Since January, health officials have confirmed
[01:12.72]39 new polio cases in Pakistan,
[01:16.36]compared to only six last year, said Anwarul Haq.
[01:23.16]He is with the National Emergency Operation Center
[01:27.60]for Polio Eradication.
[01:30.84]Eradication means getting rid of something completely.
[01:36.40]The new nationwide campaign
[01:38.76]starts on October 28.
[01:42.40]The campaign aims to vaccinate
[01:45.76]at least 32 million children.
[01:50.68]"The whole purpose of these campaigns
[01:53.64]is to achieve the target of making Pakistan
[01:57.92]a polio-free state," Haq said.
[02:02.56]Pakistan regularly launches campaigns
[02:06.68]against polio despite attacks on the workers
[02:11.40]and police assigned to protect them.
[02:15.24]Militants falsely claim
[02:17.84]that the vaccination campaigns
[02:20.24]are a Western attempt to sterilize children.
[02:25.04]To sterilize means to make someone
[02:27.68]unable to produce children.
[02:31.56]Most of the new polio cases were reported
[02:35.44]in the southwestern Balochistan
[02:38.84]and southern Sindh provinces.
[02:42.80]The next two areas with the most cases
[02:46.20]are Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and eastern Punjab.
[02:52.52]The locations worry officials
[02:55.12]since previous cases were
[02:57.20]from the northwest areas bordering Afghanistan.
[03:02.32]In September, this is where the Taliban government
[03:06.40]suddenly stopped a house-to-house
[03:09.92]vaccination campaign.
[03:13.40]Afghanistan and Pakistan
[03:15.72]are the two countries in which the spread
[03:18.68]of the possibly deadly, paralyzing disease
[03:22.56]has never been eradicated.
[03:25.72]Officials in Pakistan
[03:27.64]have said that the Taliban's decision
[03:30.44]will have major effects beyond the Afghan border.
[03:35.76]People from both sides
[03:37.72]frequently travel to each other's country.
[03:42.08]The WHO has confirmed
[03:44.64]18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.
[03:50.04]All but two of these cases
[03:52.40]were in the south of the country.
[03:55.60]That number is up from six cases in 2023.
[04:01.12]In June, Afghanistan started
[04:04.92]a house-to-house vaccination campaign
[04:08.24]for the first time in five years.
[04:12.44]The campaign has helped to reach
[04:15.16]the majority of children targeted,
[04:17.76]officials at the WHO said.
[04:21.84]Health officials in Pakistan say they want both sides
[04:25.92]to hold anti-polio campaigns at the same time.
