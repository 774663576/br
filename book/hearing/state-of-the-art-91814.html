。
[00:00.04]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:10.64]from VOA Learning English.
[00:14.28]On this program we explore
[00:20.36]words and expressions in the English language.
[00:25.24]We give definitions, examples,
[00:28.44]and notes on usage.
[00:30.56]Sometimes we use them in short conversations.
[00:35.60]When it comes to learning a language,
[00:38.56]using words in conversations
[00:41.08]is not a state-of-the-art learning method.
[00:44.56]It is a traditional method
[00:47.16]that has stood the test of time because it works.
[00:53.08]So, what method would be considered state-of-the-art?
[00:58.20]Talking with an artificial intelligence robot
[01:01.96]or using some other cutting edge computer technology
[01:06.00]would be considered state-of-the-art.
[01:09.08]It would be the newest and best available.
[01:14.68]The phrase "state-of-the-art"
[01:17.08]also describes the highest level of development.
[01:22.72]We can use state-of-the-art
[01:25.04]to describe advancements in scientific fields.
[01:29.84]Any major scientific progress
[01:32.20]can be described as state of the art.
[01:35.20]State-of-the-art can also be called top of the line
[01:40.28]or best in its class.
[01:44.20]We can also say something is the pinnacle of technology,
[01:48.48]or the peak of performance
[01:51.52]if it is state-of-the-art.
[01:54.72]Another way to express this thought
[01:57.16]is to say it is on the forefront of technology,
[02:01.00]development or advancement in a particular field.
[02:06.48]Something that is state-of-the-art is innovative.
[02:11.76]These terms all have a similar meaning:
[02:14.72]something is the latest and greatest.
[02:19.56]Some word experts say this phrase originated
[02:23.00]in the early 20th century.
[02:26.32]It is now very commonly used
[02:28.64]in both formal and informal situations.
[02:33.68]Now, let's hear some of these terms
[02:36.20]used in a conversation between two friends.
[02:40.24]A: Wow, what do you have there?
[02:43.16]B: This is my new coffee machine.
[02:46.44]It is state-of-the-art.
[02:50.24]A: I can see that! It's really impressive.
[02:53.68]B: It has an on/off setting
[02:55.32]that I can control from my phone.
[02:58.12]A: You can start your coffee from across town.
[03:01.80]B: Yes, I can!
[03:04.00]The bean container is split into four parts.
[03:10.04]So, I can have different kinds of coffee.
[03:13.64]A: That is a great innovation!
[03:16.60]B: It gets better.
[03:18.32]This machine is the pinnacle of coffee technology!
[03:23.88]Its state-of-the-art technology
[03:27.32]can also steam milk and
[03:30.12]add a choice of five different flavorings.
[03:34.44]A: Well, enough talking!
[03:36.44]Let's have a cup of coffee!
[03:38.32]I'll take mine with caramel flavor and extra frothy milk.
[03:42.68]B: Um, yeah. That's going to have to wait for a bit.
[03:48.60]A: Why?
[03:49.72]B: I don't know how to use it yet.
[03:52.00]But I will after I read this 20-page instruction book.
[03:56.96]A: Got it. I can help.
[03:59.80]But first ... I'll go get us some coffee.
[04:04.24]And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories.
[04:07.00]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.
