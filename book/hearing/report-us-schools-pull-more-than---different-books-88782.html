。
[00:00.04]The writer's organization PEN America
[00:04.32]said recently that more than a thousand different books
[00:09.68]have been banned from United States classrooms
[00:14.04]and school libraries in the last nine months.
[00:19.48]Most of the books dealt with LGBTQ issues and racism.
[00:26.64]And many books were banned under pressure
[00:29.92]from conservative parents and officials.
[00:34.48]PEN created a list of banned books.
[00:38.68]It includes a book by Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison.
[00:45.32]Actor and activist George Takei's book about his experience
[00:51.00]in a holding camp in California as a Japanese-American child
[00:57.32]during World War Two was also included.
[01:02.52]"Challenges to books, specifically books
[01:05.72]by non-white male authors are happening
[01:09.84]at the highest rates we've ever seen," said Jonathan Friedman.
[01:16.76]He is the director of PEN America's Free Expression Program
[01:22.36]and lead author of the report.
[01:26.68]He said that this level of intensity
[01:29.92]and the success of banning books in the American schools
[01:34.64]has never been seen before.
[01:38.12]In recent months, conservative parents
[01:41.36]have spoken at school meetings in numerous states
[01:45.64]to attack books that go against their views.
[01:50.40]These include books that have a sexual nature
[01:54.60]or deal with racism in a way that offends some white people.
[02:00.80]On April 7, the House of Representatives Committee
[02:05.80]on Oversight and Reform held a hearing
[02:10.08]on banned books and censorship in schools.
[02:15.16]Earlier in the week, the American Library Association
[02:20.88]released its own list of banned and challenged books
[02:25.16]that closely followed the PEN results.
[02:29.68]Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat,
[02:34.24]asked both political sides to accept the speech they do not like
[02:39.60]as well as the speech they agree with.
[02:43.72]"If we cancel or censor everything
[02:46.80]that people find offensive, nothing will be left," he said.
[02:53.16]Raskin pointed to criticism from the left
[02:56.60]seeking to remove Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
[03:03.00]They want to remove it because it uses a racially offensive word,
[03:08.60]but the overall meaning of the book is against racism and slavery.
[03:15.52]PEN found that 86 school districts had removed 1,145
[03:23.08]different books from their libraries over the last nine months.
[03:29.88]Some were permanently removed. Others are being investigated.
[03:36.32]Morrison's "The Bluest Eye" was removed in 11 school districts.
[03:43.60]"Out of Darkness" by Ashley Hope Perez was removed in 16 districts.
[03:51.28]Both books deal with racism and include sexual content.
[03:57.48]The organization said Maia Kobabe's "Gender Queer: A Memoir,"
[04:03.52]which deals with LGBTQ issues, was removed in 30 districts.
[04:11.36]More than two-thirds of the banned books were fiction,
[04:15.40]not based on true events.
[04:19.00]But books written about true events
