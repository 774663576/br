<p>There is a new kind of glasses that permits people considered legally blind to see again.</p>
<p>The company eSight created these unusual glasses. They are electronic, and work by flooding the user with huge amounts of <strong>visual</strong> information.</p>
<p><strong>How they work</strong></p>
<p>A high-speed, high resolution camera is set in the middle of the glasses. It captures video images of whatever is before it. The computer in the glasses immediately processes the video and shows it on two <strong>screens</strong> in front of the user's eyes. The video is improved by the glasses' technology so that the user is able to see the image.</p>
<p>The glasses also <strong>autofocus</strong> extremely quickly between short, medium, and long distance vision. This permits the user to move easily from reading a book, to watching TV, to looking out a window.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Fenton is the marketing director for eSight. He says users of the glasses can see things almost as if they had normal vision.</p>
<p>"The devise is almost <strong>bombarding</strong> the eyes with so much information to send to the brain through the eye that it can present them with a picture that is pretty much what you would see or I would see. It is a true wearable <strong>breakthrough</strong> for those who are living with vision loss.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="A pair of electronic eSight glasses." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/978F920C-FBB8-4892-968E-F7FCF2389F6E_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A pair of electronic eSight glasses.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Re-entering life</strong></p>
<p>The company says the glasses have what it calls "bioptic tilt capability." This feature lets users <strong>adjust</strong> the device so they have the best video clarity along with steady side, or <strong>peripheral,</strong> vision. Such balance in vision help users avoid <strong>nausea</strong>.</p>
<p>Users are advised to take time to get used to the glasses. In the beginning, they should wear them just a few hours at a time while their eyes <strong>adjust</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Giving the world better vision</strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization says about 285 million people are visually <strong>impaired</strong>, including 39 million who are blind. </p>
<p>Among that group are the sisters of eSight founder Conrad Lewis. The women are legally blind. Lewis, an engineer, decided to use his skills to help his sisters see.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the eSight glasses. They are costly, however, and<strong> insurance</strong> companies will not pay for them.</p>
<p>But, user Julissa Marquez says the investment was worth it. Marquez lost most of her eyesight from a stabbing attack in 2013. After more than ten operations she was left with about thirty percent vision in one eye. Through the eSight glasses, however, she says her vision is "amazing."</p>
<p>"...I get to see my son... I am going to see him graduate. I am going to... get to see my grandchildren. That is something huge for me because I love my child. He is my life. He is my world. He is everything."</p>
