<p>Unpredictable rains and increasing heat are making life more difficult for the people of Rayanpet, a village in southern India. The conditions are also damaging the rice crops grown there.</p>
<p>P. Ravinder Reddy, a former soldier, started farming on his family's land 16 years ago. He said, "We used to know when it would rain and for how long.”</p>
<p>That meant they used to know when to plant. Now, he said, it is not so predictable. Sometimes there is too much rain. Sometimes there is no rain at all.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="P. Ravinder Reddy, a farmer, applies fungicide to peanut seeds before sowing in Rayanpet village of Telangana state, India, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.

<p>Agricultural research organizations in India have been working for years to engineer rice seeds that can survive in a changing climate. Reddy has been experimenting with new kinds of rice for the past five years. The new rice plants are producing more grain with less water. They are also more disease resistant.</p>
<p>Reddy says he has planted them across part of his 10-hectare field. He still grows some of the older kinds because there is a demand for them. But he said, “I think in a few years, we will use only these <strong>tougher</strong> seeds."</p>
<p>India is one of the world's largest producers and <strong>consumers</strong> of wheat and rice. Research organizations in that country and around the world have worked for years to produce seeds that are better able to handle <strong>drought</strong>, unseasonal rains, plant diseases and more.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a United Nations report said more than 700 million people suffered from hunger last year. More than one-third of the worldwide population does not have the money to buy healthy foods.</p>
<p><strong>Defending against climate shocks</strong></p>
<p>India has nearly 120 million farmers. Most have less than two hectares of land. Unpredictable rainfall, rising temperatures and increased <strong>pest </strong>problems all threaten their ability to grow food.</p>
<p>Experts say the dangers to rice include increasing salt content in groundwater, heavy rainfall over short periods, long periods of drought and increasing nighttime temperatures.</p>
<p>Some farmers are turning to methods of natural farming to deal with climate change. But that can mean reduced <strong>yields</strong>. India's federal government is also urging the use of climate-<strong>resilient </strong>seeds that result in better yields.</p>
<p><strong>Government research support</strong></p>
<p>Ashok Kumar Singh is former director of New Delhi-based Indian Agriculture Research Institute. He has overseen the creation of many successful rice varieties that withstand pests and plant diseases. His organization has helped release more than 2,000 climate-resilient kinds of seed in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>"We really need these seeds to deal with these multiple <strong>issues </strong>created by global warming," Singh said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi released 109 climate-resilient seeds for several different crops. India's federal government has announced plans to make sure at least 25 percent of rice-growing fields in the country will be planted with climate-resilient seeds in the coming winter crop season.</p>
<p>In Rayanpet village, Reddy is preparing to plant rice seeds for the winter season in a few weeks.</p>
<p>"It is good to keep trying new seeds, as after some time all of them will have some issue or the other," Reddy said. “If the government can also make sure we get good prices for our crops after harvest, that would help farmers like us a great deal.”</p>
