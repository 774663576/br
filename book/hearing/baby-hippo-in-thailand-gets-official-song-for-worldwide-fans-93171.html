<p>Moo Deng – which means “<strong>bouncy</strong> pork” in Thai – is a kind of meatball. The name, chosen by fans on social media, is similar to those of her two <strong>siblings</strong>: Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork). In addition, the zoo has a common hippo named Kha Moo (stewed pork leg).</p>
<p>Moo Deng's popularity has spread internationally and she has gained the attention of some professional sports teams. Fans say her name fits her lively <strong>personality</strong>. Moo Deng likes to “deng,” or bounce, and her bouncing behavior has led to countless internet <strong>memes</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the German soccer team FC Bayern, American basketball team Phoenix Suns and the American football team Washington Commanders have all created Moo Deng memes. The images give her interesting things to wear and put her in different human-like situations.</p>
<p>Atthapon, the zoo worker, told The Associated Press he was surprised the newborn pygmy hippo quickly became such a huge internet star. “I wanted people to know her,” he explained. “I wanted a lot of people to visit her, or watch her online, or leave fun comments. I never would've thought (of this),” he added.</p>
<p>The widespread publicity led a well-known Thai composer to write and produce a special song for Moo Deng. The lively, 50-second song is called, naturally, <em>Moodeng</em>. One of Thailand's biggest recording companies, GMM Music, released the song.</p>
<p>A music video that goes along with the song shows the baby hippo bouncing around, playing with her keeper or spending time with her mother, Jona.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>Moo Deng is now four months old. She has also been drawing big crowds at the zoo. Officials estimated the baby hippo has brought in about 3,000 to 5,000 visitors a day on average during the past few months. The zoo has been selling clothes, bedding and other products based on Moo Deng.</p>
<p>The zoo's director is Narongwit Chodchoi. He told the AP that the additional earnings from Moo Deng will help the zoo's <strong>breeding</strong> programs for many endangered animals, like the pygmy hippopotamus. Illegal hunting and loss of <strong>habitat</strong> threatens the animal's existence. Pygmy hippos are native to West Africa. But experts say there are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild.</p>
<p>All four versions of the Moo Deng song are available on YouTube and on streaming services including Spotify and Apple Music.</p>
