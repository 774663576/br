。
[00:00.04]American high school students'
[00:02.00]scores on the ACT college admissions test
[00:06.24]have dropped to their lowest in more than 30 years.
[00:10.56]The average score of students
[00:13.32]who completed high school in 2023
[00:15.92]was 19.5 out of a possible 36.
[00:20.64]Last year, students averaged 19.8.
[00:25.20]The average score dropped for the sixth straight year.
[00:30.40]Scores were already falling before the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:35.28]But the scores fell faster
[00:37.96]during and after the pandemic period.
[00:41.48]The students who took the test in 2023
[00:45.16]were in their first year of high school
[00:47.80]when COVID-19 reached the United States.
[00:52.24]Janet Godwin leads ACT,
[00:55.24]the nonprofit organization that administers the test.
[00:59.60]She said that high schools are "not doing enough
[01:02.64]to ensure that graduates are truly ready for
[01:06.44]postsecondary success in college and career."
[01:11.88]The average scores in reading, math and science
[01:16.08]were all below the level that ACT says
[01:19.80]demonstrates a good chance of succeeding
[01:22.96]in first-year college courses.
[01:26.24]The average score in English
[01:28.24]was just above the "benchmark" level,
[01:31.08]but it was still lower than in 2022.
[01:35.24]The falling scores come at the same time
[01:38.44]many colleges and universities
[01:41.20]established admissions policies
[01:44.08]that do not require the test.
[01:46.64]However, students are welcome
[01:49.04]to provide the scores if they wish.
[01:52.64]Some universities do not look at test scores
[01:56.24]even if students send them in.
[01:59.44]College admission tests have been criticized
[02:02.56]for favoring students who come from
[02:04.88]wealthier families and schools.
[02:08.20]Godwin, however, said the test scores from her organization
[02:13.28]still help universities place students in the proper classes.
[02:18.92]"Even in a test-optional environment,
[02:21.92]these kinds of objective
[02:23.76]test scores about academic readiness
[02:26.92]are incredibly important," she said.
[02:30.72]Some current high school students wonder
[02:33.20]why the tests are necessary.
[02:35.32]Denise Cabrera is a 17-year-old in Hawaii.
[02:40.20]She said all of her classmates
[02:42.60]had to take the test in 11th grade.
[02:45.52]Cabrera said she believed
[02:48.28]taking it and getting a good score
[02:50.64]would help her get into a good college.
[02:52.92]But she thinks colleges and universities
[02:55.68]can learn more about a student
[02:57.32]by looking at "different qualities ...
[03:00.20]outside of just a one-time test score."
[03:04.40]Godwin said about 1.4 million high school students
[03:08.60]took the test this year.
[03:10.36]That was an increase over 2022
[03:13.40]but still below the numbers recorded before the pandemic.
[03:18.04]Only 21 percent of students reached the levels
[03:23.12]the ACT organization believes are necessary
[03:26.52]to predict good success in college.
