[00:00.04]A traditional ceremony for children in Japan
[00:05.64]is growing popular for animals there as well.
[00:11.28]Natsuki Aoki recently flew
[00:14.96]with her two Chihuahua dogs
[00:17.72]from the western city of Hiroshima
[00:21.28]to Tokyo, the nation's capital.
[00:24.48]She took the trip so the little dogs
[00:28.84]could receive a special blessing
[00:31.96]at the Zama Shrine, a Shinto holy place.
[00:37.56]Aoki noted that few religious centers
[00:41.48]are open to animals.
[00:43.96]"I think it would be great
[00:45.96]to see more places like this,"
[00:48.88]the 33-year-old said on Tuesday.
[00:53.32]The Zama Shrine dates back to the 6th century.
[00:59.04]It is about 25 kilometers southwest of Tokyo.
[01:05.60]The religious center established
[01:08.44]a prayer area for animals in 2012.
[01:13.48]It now hosts Shichi-Go-San ceremonies
[01:17.76]where animal owners can pray for the health
[01:21.60]and happiness of their dogs and cats.
[01:26.28]The ceremony, which means
[01:29.16]Seven-Five-Three in Japanese,
[01:32.80]is traditionally celebrated in mid-November
[01:37.08]for children reaching those ages.
[01:41.16]Parents dress their girls and boys in kimonos
[01:46.04]and bring them to a Shinto holy place
[01:49.60]for the ceremony.
[01:52.20]On Tuesday, several people led their animals
[01:56.32]up the steps of the Inuneko Jinja,
[02:00.40]or Dog-Cat Shrine.
[02:04.36]They prayed and received a blessing
[02:07.48]from a Shinto clergy.
[02:10.32]Six Shiba Inu dogs wearing kimonos
[02:14.64]lined up for pictures at the event.
[02:18.92]Japan's birth rate dropped
[02:21.20]for a seventh straight year in 2022
[02:25.44]to a record low,
[02:27.68]while deaths increased to an all-time high.
[02:33.40]"The number of children is decreasing each year,
[02:37.68]and as a result, more and more people
[02:41.64]are pouring their love into their dogs and cats,"
[02:46.44]said Yoshinori Hiraga of the Zama Shrine.
[02:51.28]"We want to offer the pet owners a place
[02:55.28]at Zama Shrine for them to thank the gods
[02:59.36]when their dogs and cats reach the ages
[03:03.08]of three, five, and seven," said Hiraga.
[03:08.44]The clergy estimated about 120 pets
[03:13.12]would be brought to the shrine this season.
[03:17.68]Among them was Masayo Tashiro,
[03:21.16]who brought two dogs, a terrier and a Pomeranian
[03:25.72]to the center as she made offerings and prayers.
[03:30.32]"They are very important to me,
[03:33.32]like my own children,"
[03:35.44]said the 53-year-old caregiver.
[03:38.36]"I came here to pray that they will have a safe
[03:42.76]and healthy life with us together."
