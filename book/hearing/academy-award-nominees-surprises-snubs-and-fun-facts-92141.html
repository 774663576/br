<p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Tuesday announced the nominees for Hollywood's highest movie awards --- the Oscars. As usual, there were surprises. And there were snubs, meaning filmmakers or films that were rejected as candidates. Here are some of the facts about this year's nominees.</p>
<p><strong>Fostering the Oscars</strong></p>
<p>Actor Jodie Foster was nominated for her performance in a supporting role in the film <em>Nyad</em>. It is her fifth nomination. The first came 47 years ago when she was just 14 years old.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An Oscar statue appears outside the Dolby Theatre for the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles on February 21, 2015. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/23dac5d6-fa99-4d71-b4b5-25bc323a2275_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An Oscar statue appears outside the Dolby Theatre for the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles on February 21, 2015. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)</span></div>
<p>This year she returns as a nominee after an unusually long absence from the Oscars. Her last nomination was for <em>Nell</em> in 1995.</p>
<p>Foster has won two Academy Awards as a lead actor. Her first came in 1989 for the movie <em>The Accused</em>. She won again in 1992 for the film <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>. Her costar in <em>Nyad</em>, Annette Bening, is also nominated for an Oscar in the best performance by a lead actress <strong>category</strong>. Like Foster, Bening has been nominated four other times. But she has yet to win any Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Foster has more nominations than the rest of the actors in her category combined. Emily Blunt, Danielle Brooks, America Ferrera and Da'Vine Joy Randolph are all first-time nominees.</p>
<p>Foster's <strong>gap</strong> between nominations is not a record, though. Last year, actor Judd Hirsch got his first nomination in 42 years for his performance in <em>The Fabelmans</em>.</p>
<p><strong>John Williams dials in on Disney with ‘destiny'</strong></p>
<p>Music writer, or composer, John Williams, is back in the running for an Oscar. The 91-year-old became on Tuesday the oldest nominee in history for his <strong>original score</strong> for <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em>. Williams broke the age record of 90 set last year by nominee John Williams.</p>
<p>The composer has been nominated for 54 Academy Awards. He is the most Oscar-nominated living person. He needs six more to overtake Walt Disney's record of 59 nominations.</p>
<p>Williams has won five Oscars. His last was in 1994 for the score of <em>Schindler's List</em>, which also won the award for best picture.</p>
<p><strong>Women's films honored, women snubbed</strong></p>
<p>A record three films directed by women were nominated for best picture: <em>Barbie</em> from Greta Gerwig, <em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> from Justine Triet, and <em>Past Lives</em> from Celine Song.</p>
<p>But only one of them – Triet – received a best director nomination.</p>
<p>Gerwig's snub, along with <em>Barbie</em> star Margot Robbie's in the best actress category, were widely protested after the nominations were announced Tuesday. But each is still in the larger group of nominees. Robbie is a producer who will get an Oscar if <em>Barbie</em> wins best picture. And Gerwig is nominated for best adapted screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>The spirit of Spielberg and scores for Scorsese</strong></p>
<p>Director Steven Spielberg was a 2024 Oscar presence even on a year off. Spielberg did not direct a movie last year that met time limits for Academy Award consideration. However, he is nominated as a producer of the movie <em>Maestro</em>.</p>
<p>If it wins best picture, Spielberg will take home his fourth Oscar.</p>
<p>Martin Scorsese, meanwhile, broke Spielberg's record on director nominations. Scorsese is nominated this year for the movie <em>The Killers of the Flower Moon</em>.</p>
