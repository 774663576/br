。
[00:00.76]Asian countries are increasingly concerned that popular anger in the U.S. and Europe
[00:07.64]might hurt their exports and lead to a global economic slowdown.
[00:14.04]Voters in industrialized countries are frustrated with job losses in industries
[00:21.28]such as steel and automobile manufacturing.
[00:25.88]Many blame the losses on globalization and free trade policies.
[00:32.64]These were reportedly major issues in the British vote to leave the European Union.
[00:39.52]They also have been energetically discussed in the U.S. presidential election.
[00:46.52]Some experts are calling these concerns protectionism,
[00:51.24]or seeking to protect or block off a country's market from foreign businesses.
[00:58.48]Frederic Neumann co-directs Asian economics research for HSBC Bank in Hong Kong.
[01:08.32]He said, "Rising protectionism could throw sand in the wheels
[01:13.60]of the global trading system and so start to gum it up."
[01:20.44]The vote in Britain resulted in wild changes in financial markets around the world.
[01:28.28]Major East Asian countries were no exception.
[01:32.56]They reacted with short-term economic measures
[01:36.44]meant to stabilize their markets because of the June 23 vote.
[01:43.56]South Korea ordered an increase in government spending.
[01:48.84]China let the value of its currency fall.
[01:52.48]And Japan has said it is considering taking measures
[01:56.60]if the value of the Japanese yen continues to rise.
[02:01.56]However, reaction in Asia to the heated disputes over trade in the West,
[02:08.84]especially in the U.S., has been somewhat muted.
[02:13.68]Peter Drysdale heads the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research
[02:20.31]at the Australian National University's Crawford School of Public Policy.
[02:27.84]He said anxiety in Asia is eased by the perception
[02:32.68]that a more thoughtful discussion will develop over time.
[02:38.32]"The rhetoric coming out of the political campaign in the United States of course
[02:44.00]does disturb policy leaders elsewhere in the world including Asia," Drysdale said.
[02:52.48]U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump
[02:56.44]has attacked free trade agreements (FTA) during his campaign.
[03:01.64]He called for renegotiating or withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement,
[03:09.12]known as NAFTA, with Canada and Mexico.
[03:13.52]He also said he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
[03:19.32]That trade agreement includes the United States and 11 other Pacific countries.
[03:26.84]Trump has criticized trade deals, but he is not alone.
[03:32.18]The Democratic Party presumptive nominee for president, Hillary Clinton,
[03:37.72]also voiced opposition to the TPP during her campaign.
[03:43.80]She has, however, supported free trade agreements in the past.
[03:49.76]She spoke in support of the NAFTA deal as first lady of the U.S.
[03:55.28]with her husband, former president Bill Clinton.
[03:59.64]He signed the agreement into law in 1993.
[04:04.72]Clinton also supported the TPP when she was President Barack Obama's secretary of state.
[04:13.80]As a presidential candidate, however,
[04:16.68]she said the final version was not good for American workers.
[04:22.72]Some experts see her change in position as, at least partly,
[04:28.84]a reaction to her opponent in the primary elections Bernie Sanders.
[04:35.52]He has been outspoken in his opposition to trade deals.
[04:42.08]However, President Obama is hopeful that the U.S. Senate will approve the TPP
[04:49.36]after Congressional elections in November.
[04:53.68]Economists said Asian countries could take further measures
[04:59.52]to open up their economies and increase investment in Western countries.
[05:06.88]Drysdale said this could ease anti-trade anger in the West.
[05:13.00]He added that is already happening to some extent.
[05:17.68]"Investors in India and China and elsewhere in the region are looking to put plants
[05:25.44]and investment into industrial countries and the United States in particular," he said.
[05:32.56]Frederic Neumann of HSBC said American companies do complain
[05:39.60]of complex regulations blocking market access to Korea although an agreement is in place.
[05:48.88]Officials in Seoul say South Korea has a trade surplus of about $10 billion with the U.S.
[05:58.12]But, they note that South Korean companies invest more in America than U.S. companies invest in Korea.
[06:08.32]Last week, Republican candidate Trump took specific aim at the U.S. free trade agreement with South Korea.
[06:18.48]He said the deal doubled the U.S. trade deficit with its East Asian ally
[06:24.84]and lost nearly 100,000 American jobs.
