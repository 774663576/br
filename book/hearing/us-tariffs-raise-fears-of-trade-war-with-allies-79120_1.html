。
[00:00.04]The United States says it will require tariffs on steel and aluminum imports
[00:06.88]from Europe, Mexico and Canada.
[00:11.40]U.S. officials announced the tariffs are a result of their failure to win trade concessions.
[00:20.00]Officials said the import taxes would take effect on Friday.
[00:27.20]The announcement led to promises of action from major American allies,
[00:32.88]rising trade tensions and a drop in stock prices.
[00:38.84]President Donald Trump had announced the tariffs in March.
[00:44.72]Trump said they were needed to protect the United States from unfair competition.
[00:52.04]But he delayed the measure to give time for negotiations.
[00:58.12]The tariffs will be 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
[01:05.41]Europe and Mexico reacted to the U.S. move
[01:10.10]with their own lists of tariffs on American products,
[01:14.24]raising fears of a trade war among allies.
[01:19.56]Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission,
[01:23.64]called the U.S. decision "protectionism, pure and simple."
[01:29.72]Last March, the European Union prepared a list of possible tariffs  on American goods,
[01:36.32]including orange juice, peanut butter, clothing, whiskey, boats and motorcycles.
[01:45.60]Mexico said it would tax a number of U.S. imports, including pork bellies,
[01:51.56]apples, grapes, cheeses and flat steel.
[01:57.28]In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the U.S. tariffs "totally unacceptable."
[02:05.36]Trudeau said Canada supplied "aluminum and steel to the U.S. defense industry,
[02:11.48]putting aluminum in American planes and steel in American tanks."
[02:17.44]He promised to add Canadian tariffs on a number of American goods.
[02:23.92]Brazil, Argentina and Australia have agreed to limit steel shipments to the U.S. to avoid tariffs.
[02:33.48]But import taxes remain on steel and aluminum imports from Japan.
[02:40.84]U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross spoke to reporters on Thursday.
[02:48.32]He said that talks with Canada and Mexico
[02:51.68]over amending the North American Free Trade Agreement
[02:55.05]were "taking longer than we had hoped."
[02:59.12]Speaking from a meeting in Paris,
[03:02.04]Ross noted that talks with Europe had "made some progress,"
[03:06.88]but not enough for the U.S.
[03:10.28]He said, "We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have further discussions."
[03:18.68]German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed opposition
[03:22.49]to the rising trade tensions before the U.S. announcement.
[03:27.92]She said the tariffs were in violation of the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
[03:35.92]After the U.S. action, the European Union announced plans
[03:40.76]to bring its case against the U.S. tariffs to the WTO on Friday.
[03:47.60]French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire criticized the tariffs.
[03:53.52]He said they "will only lead to the victory of those who want less growth,
[03:59.12]those who don't think we can develop our economies across the world."
[04:05.28]Even some of Trump's supporters criticized the measures.
[04:10.96]U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch said,
[04:14.12]"Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are a tax hike on Americans."
[04:20.56]He added that it would hurt both workers and businesses.
[04:25.96]Like Trump, Hatch is a member of the Republican Party.
[04:31.76]The groups Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity
[04:38.20]said the tariffs would hurt the nation's economy and low unemployment rates.
[04:45.44]U.S. presidential spokesman Raj Shah told Fox News:
[04:50.72]"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum.
[04:57.44]They're critical for national security."
