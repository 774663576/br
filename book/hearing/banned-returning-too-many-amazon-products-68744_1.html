<p>The reason? He returned too many Amazon purchases, he said on his website, TechWalls.com.他在自己的网站Techwalls上表示，原因是他在亚马逊网站上退货太多次。</p>
<p>Do said he returned six items in the past two months. He said he was not satisfied with the quality of the products.<br/>Do表示过去两个月他退了六次货。他说，他对这些产品的质量并不满意。</p>
<p>Amazon first sent him a warning about his "unusually high rate of problems," Do said.<br/>亚马逊先是就他“异常高比率的各种问题”给他发送了一封警告邮件。</p>
<p>Later, when his wife returned a bicycle purchased on her Amazon account, the company cancelled both their accounts, Do said.<br/>随后，当他的妻子退回一辆通过她的亚马逊帐号购买的自行车之后，亚马逊公司取消了他们两人的账户。</p>
<p>Mark Cohen is former chairman and chief executive officer of Sears Canada Inc. He is not surprised Amazon and other businesses are trying to stop frequent returns.<br/>马克·科恩（Mark Cohen）是西尔斯加拿大公司前董事长兼首席执行官。他对亚马逊和其它公司试图阻止频繁退货并不觉得惊讶。</p>
<p>The costs are very high for a company like Amazon that offers many customers both free delivery and free returns, Cohen told VOA.<br/>科恩对美国之音表示，像亚马逊这种向很多客户同时提供免费送货和退货的公司的成本非常高。</p>
<p>The website Dyanamic.action.com reported that returns cost merchants $642.6 billion a year worldwide.<br/>Dyanamic.action.com网站报告称，每年世界各地退货消耗了商家6426亿美元。</p>
<p>But banning a customer can create bad feelings. Greg Nelson recently spoke to the Guardian newspaper after Amazon UK banned him from its shopping website.<br/>但是禁止某位客户购物会引发不良情绪。格雷格·尼尔森（Greg Nelson）最近在亚马逊英国站禁止其访问网站之后接受了卫报采访。</p>
<p>Nelson said he sent back 37 of the 343 items he bought on the website. He said he had a good reason for each return.<br/>他说，他退回了在该网站购买的343件商品中的37件。他说每次退货他都有正当理由。</p>
<p>"I could understand if there were evidence that I had somehow tried to abuse the system, but I haven't," Nelson told the Guardian.<br/>尼尔森对卫报表示，“如果有证据表明我在某种程度上试图滥用（退货）系统，我能理解（禁止我访问）。但是我并没有（滥用该系统）。”</p>
<p>Amazon said it only closes accounts "in a tiny fraction of cases" when it finds "extreme account abuse."<br/>亚马逊表示，当他们发现账户严重滥用时，他们只关闭了极小比例的账户。</p>
<p>Cohen, the former head of Sears Canada and now a Columbia University professor, said many returns are valid. It is fine to return clothing that does not fit, is the wrong color, or arrived damaged, he said.<br/>西尔斯加拿大公司前任负责人科恩现在是哥伦比亚大学教授。他说，很多退货是合理的。当衣服不合身、颜色不对或送达时损坏，退货没问题。</p>

<p>Cohen cites the example of people who buy a dress or suit, wear it once to a wedding or other special event, and then return it.<br/>科恩引用了有人购买裙子或西装，穿一次去参加婚礼或其它特殊活动，然后退货的例子。</p>
<p>Cohen said Sears Canada had a customer who bought items from the Sears Catalog all the time – and returned every single purchase.<br/>科恩表示，西尔斯加拿大公司曾经有一位客户老是通过西尔斯商品目录购物，然后退回每一单购买的东西。</p>
<p>Cohen said it seemed the customer wanted something to do and enjoyed placing orders, getting them delivered and sending them back.<br/>科恩表示，看上去这位客户是想找点事做，他喜欢下单、收货然后退货。</p>
<p>Cohen said he had to convince his staff to ban the customer. Some staffers said a ban did not fulfill the company's promise to "completely satisfy" customers.<br/>科恩表示，他必须说服他的员工禁止这位客户。一些员工表示，禁止该客户购物不符合该公司完全满足客户这一承诺。</p>
<p>He helped write a letter to the customer. It explained she could no longer shop "since we clearly have been unable to satisfy your needs as much as we have tried."<br/>他帮助写了一封信给这位客户。信中解释称她不能再购物，因为我们显然已经无法满足您的需求。</p>
<p>Cohen had won the argument.<br/>科恩赢得了这次争论。</p>
<p>On his TechWalls website, Do said he bought "almost everything" from Amazon. That included cheap items like groceries and toilet paper, and more expensive items like laptop computers.<br/>Do在他的网站上表示，他几乎所有东西都从亚马逊上购买。这包括生活用品和卫生纸等廉价商品，也包括笔记本电脑等更加昂贵的商品。</p>
<p>He said the returned items costs more than the products he kept. But he said he only returns products "when they don't meet my expectation."<br/>他说退货商品比他买下的商品费用更高。但他表示，他只在商品不符合期望时才退货。</p>
<p>Do had some support from his online readers. "Bob" wrote that he, too, was banned for too many returns.<br/>Do得到了一些在线读者的支持。鲍勃写道，他也因为太多次退货被禁止购物。</p>
<p>"It was a crazy high percentage in one bad month. But, yes, they were all defective. I wasn't abusing/trying and returning," Bob wrote.<br/>鲍勃写道，“有一个糟糕的月份退货比例高得疯狂。但是它们都有缺陷。我没有滥用退货。”</p>
<p>Cohen said online businesses like Amazon are getting hit with more returns than traditional stores.<br/>科恩表示，亚马逊之类的网络公司比传统商场更多受到退货打击。</p>
<p>One reason, he said, is that shopping online does not allow customers to try on clothing or take a close look before buying.<br/>他说原因之一是网上购物没法让客户在购买之前试穿衣服或仔细查看。</p>
<p>Many products, he said, are returned after they have been taken out of their packages, often in bad shape. In the case of clothing, he said, returns often come in after the selling season ended for winter or summer.<br/>他说，许多产品都在被打开包装之后退货，通常状况很糟糕。他说，就服装而言，退货往往发生在冬季或夏季销售季节结束之后。</p>
<p>That makes them hard to sell, or forces big price cuts, Cohen said.<br/>科恩表示，这让这些商品难以卖出或被迫大降价。</p>

[00:00.24]Tuan Do of New York says Amazon has banned him
[00:05.00]from shopping on that website.
[00:07.84]The reason? He returned too many Amazon purchases,
[00:12.72]he said on his website, TechWalls.com.
[00:17.20]Do said he returned six items in the past two months.
[00:22.68]He said he was not satisfied with the quality of the products.
[00:27.60]Amazon first sent him a warning
[00:31.28]about his "unusually high rate of problems," Do said.
[00:37.36]Later, when his wife returned a bicycle
[00:41.32]purchased on her Amazon account,
[00:43.96]the company cancelled both their accounts, Do said.
[00:48.40]Mark Cohen is former chairman
[00:52.02]and chief executive officer of Sears Canada Inc.
[00:55.60]He is not surprised Amazon and other businesses
[01:00.20]are trying to stop frequent returns.
[01:04.32]The costs are very high for a company like Amazon that offers many customers
[01:11.08]both free delivery and free returns, Cohen told VOA.
[01:16.84]The website Dyanamic.action.com reported
[01:21.61]that returns cost merchants $642.6 billion a year worldwide.
[01:29.32]But banning a customer can create bad feelings.
[01:33.40]Greg Nelson recently spoke to the Guardian newspaper
[01:37.68]after Amazon UK banned him from its shopping website.
[01:42.76]Nelson said he sent back 37 of the 343 items he bought on the website.
[01:50.80]He said he had a good reason for each return.
[01:54.84]"I could understand if there were evidence
[01:58.20]that I had somehow tried to abuse the system,
[02:01.64]but I haven't," Nelson told the Guardian.
[02:05.08]Amazon said it only closes accounts "in a tiny fraction of cases"
[02:11.56]when it finds "extreme account abuse."
[02:15.56]Cohen, the former head of Sears Canada
[02:20.60]and now a Columbia University professor,
[02:24.12]said many returns are valid.
[02:26.49]It is fine to return clothing that does not fit,
[02:30.36]is the wrong color, or arrived damaged, he said.
[02:34.92]But there are many cases of "clear abuse."
[02:38.96]Cohen cites the example of people who buy a dress or suit,
[02:44.04]wear it once to a wedding or other special event, and then return it.
[02:49.88]Cohen said Sears Canada had a customer who bought items
[02:54.68]from the Sears Catalog all the tim
[02:57.84]e – and returned every single purchase.
[03:02.04]Cohen said it seemed the customer wanted something to do
[03:05.88]and enjoyed placing orders, getting them delivered and sending them back.
[03:11.59]Cohen said he had to convince his staff to ban the customer.
[03:16.56]Some staffers said a ban did not
[03:19.52]fulfill the company's promise to "completely satisfy" customers.
[03:25.80]He helped write a letter to the customer.
[03:28.48]It explained she could no longer shop
[03:31.72]"since we clearly have been unable to satisfy your needs
[03:36.13]as much as we have tried."
[03:38.68]Cohen had won the argument.
[03:42.24]On his TechWalls website,
[03:45.18]Do said he bought "almost everything" from Amazon.
[03:49.60]That included cheap items like groceries and toilet paper,
[03:53.28]and more expensive items like laptop computers.
[03:57.48]He said the returned items costs more than the products he kept.
[04:03.32]But he said he only returns products
[04:06.08]"when they don't meet my expectation."
[04:10.12]Do had some support from his online readers.
[04:14.56]"Bob" wrote that he, too, was banned for too many returns.
[04:19.89]"It was a crazy high percentage in one bad month.
[04:23.96]But, yes, they were all defective.
[04:27.08]I wasn't abusing/trying and returning," Bob wrote.
[04:32.04]Cohen said online businesses like Amazon
[04:35.64]are getting hit with more returns than traditional stores.
[04:39.56]One reason, he said, is that shopping online
[04:43.76]does not allow customers to try on clothing
[04:47.36]or take a close look before buying.
[04:50.76]Many products, he said, are returned
[04:54.12]after they have been taken out of their packages, often in bad shape.
[04:59.39]In the case of clothing, he said,
[05:02.40]returns often come in after the selling season ended for winter or summer.
[05:08.64]That makes them hard to sell,
[05:11.24]or forces big price cuts, Cohen said.
