<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Researchers Use Brain Cells to Control Aging in Mice]

。
[00:00.04]It is a question people have been asking for—well-- ages.
[00:04.92]Is there a way to turn back the aging process?
[00:10.56]For centuries, people have been looking for a "fountain of youth."
[00:16.94]The idea is that if you find a magical fountain,
[00:22.12]and drink from its waters, you will not age.
[00:27.12]Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León
[00:31.40]searched for waters with magical powers in the early 1500s.
[00:38.08]But what he found instead is the American state of Florida.
[00:45.16]Researchers in New York did not find an actual fountain of youth,
[00:51.36]but they may have found a way to turn back the aging process.
[00:58.56]It appears the answer may be hidden right between your eyes,
[01:05.52]in an area called the hypothalamus.
[01:09.52]The hypothalamus is part of your brain.
[01:13.48]It controls important activities within the body.
[01:17.92]They include growth, reproduction and the way we process food.
[01:25.44]Researchers at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine
[01:31.08]found that hypothalamus neural stem cells
[01:36.64]also influence how fast aging takes place in the body.
[01:43.76]What are stem cells?
[01:46.36]They are simple cells that can develop into specialized cells,
[01:52.92]like blood or skin cells.
[01:56.72]Stem cells can also repair damaged tissues and organs.
[02:04.40]Dongsheng Cai is a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
[02:11.92]He was the lead researcher in a study on aging in mice.
[02:17.56]He and his team reported their findings in the journal Nature.
[02:23.70]Cai explains what they found.
[02:28.12]"Aging speed is controlled, can be controlled by a particular place in the body,
[02:33.88]which is the hypothalamus.
[02:36.12]And it can be controlled by a particular type of cells,
[02:40.08]which are hypothalamus stem cells.
[02:42.36]I think these findings are quite interesting, potentially even remarkable."
[02:47.08]He adds that when the hypothalamus starts aging,
[02:51.84]so does the body.
[02:54.32]"So when hypothalamus function is in decline,
[02:57.48]particularly the loss of hypothalamus stem cells,
[03:01.96]and this protection against the aging development is lost,
[03:06.80]it eventually leads to aging."
[03:08.84]Using this information, the researchers began trying to activate,
[03:14.33]or energize, the hypothalamus in laboratory mice.
[03:19.88]They did this by injecting the animals with stem cells.
[03:26.92]Later, the researchers examined tissues and tested for changes in behavior.
[03:34.40]They looked for changes in the strength
[03:37.12]and coordination of the animals' muscles.
[03:41.08]They also studied the social behavior and cognitive ability of the mice.
[03:47.80]The researchers say the results show that the treatment slowed aging in the animals.
[03:57.08]Cai says injecting middle-aged mice with stem cells from younger mice
[04:05.08]helped the older animals live longer.
[04:09.92]"When we injected the hypothalamus stem cells,
[04:13.52]which were derived from young mice,
[04:16.44]we injected them to the middle-aged mice and that was, in fact, to slow down aging.
[04:22.32]So the mouse aged slowly
[04:26.22]and they also have increased their lifespan, which is longevity."
[04:33.08]But these results were just from studying mice in a laboratory.
[04:40.04]If the mice can live longer,
[04:42.76]does that mean people could have longer lives?
[04:47.40]The next step is to see if the anti-aging effects also work in human beings.
[04:56.24]"If we can translate what we have seen in animals to humans,
[05:02.04]I think humans, they can function better during later ages, later stage of aging."
[05:14.96]Cai and his team say their studies may have other benefits.
[05:20.80]They say the findings could lead to new ways to help doctors identify
[05:28.28]and treat any number of age-related health issues.
