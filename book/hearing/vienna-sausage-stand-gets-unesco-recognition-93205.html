。
[00:00.04]A popular kind of sausage
[00:02.52]stand in Vienna, Austria
[00:05.48]has been recognized by the United Nations
[00:09.24]for its cultural value.
[00:11.68]The street stands – called
[00:14.68]"Würstelstands" in German
[00:17.40]– are a famous part of the Austrian capital's history.
[00:21.76]In addition to selling food,
[00:24.92]they are known for being a place
[00:27.48]where many different kinds of people
[00:30.16]can come together to eat
[00:32.72]and spend social time.
[00:35.24]UNESCO is the United Nations' Educational,
[00:39.92]Scientific and Cultural Organization.
[00:43.84]It seeks to recognize and help
[00:47.16]save cultural treasures
[00:49.32]and traditions around the world.
[00:52.84]Vienna's Würstelstands
[00:55.72]were recently added to a list
[00:58.12]of the country's "intangible cultural heritage."
[01:02.80]The Austrian UNESCO Commission
[01:06.12]oversees the list.
[01:08.68]Among other things on the list
[01:11.48]are Vienna's traditional wine establishments
[01:15.64]– called "Heurigen"
[01:17.44]– which were recognized in 2019.
[01:21.00]In addition, the city's famous
[01:23.80]coffee house culture was honored in 2011.
[01:28.36]The Associated Press reports
[01:31.64]the history of Würstelstands
[01:34.36]goes back generations.
[01:36.52]And they are known for much more
[01:39.84]than the tasty sausages they serve.
[01:43.36]They have been bringing people
[01:45.84]of many different backgrounds together
[01:48.52]for many years.
[01:50.36]The stands have also developed
[01:52.96]some of their own terms.
[01:55.28]These include the "Haasse,"
[01:58.20]a special kind of boiled sausage.
[02:01.20]Another unusual stand offering
[02:04.20]is known as the "Kasekrainer"
[02:07.52]– a smoked creation filled with cheese.
[02:11.12]And there is "Oaschpfeiferl,"
[02:14.40]a spicy peperoni version,
[02:16.92]as well as the pickled "Krokodü."
[02:20.32]Josef Bitzinger runs the Bitzinger Würstelstand.
[02:25.32]He told the AP that sausage
[02:28.48]stands have a long history in Vienna.
[02:32.16]His stand enjoys a favorable spot,
[02:35.80]next to the city's Albertina museum
[02:39.44]and just behind the Vienna State Opera.
[02:43.76]"Originally it was just a bucket
[02:46.96]with hot water in which the sausages
[02:50.24]used to swim," Bitzinger said.
[02:53.52]He added that the stands began
[02:57.00]with small vehicles pulled by dogs or horses.
[03:01.40]Later, they were transported
[03:04.00]by cars or big trucks.
[03:06.76]The tradition of Würstelstand
[03:09.80]goes back to the pre-World War I days
[03:13.28]of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[03:16.48]At that time, former soldiers
[03:19.52]set up movable cooking shops to make a living.
[03:23.88]The city's longest-serving stand
[03:27.48]in a fixed spot is Würstelstand Leo.
[03:31.76]It has been serving up sausages since 1928.
[03:37.00]The stands started to develop quickly in 1969,
[03:42.56]when the government decided
[03:44.48]to begin approving fixed stands.
[03:48.08]Vienna's mayor, Michael Ludwig,
[03:52.00]said he thinks the UNESCO recognition
[03:55.28]"honors the tradition,
[03:57.32]the hospitality and the diversity of our city."
[04:01.92]He added that the stands
[04:04.20]remain a big part of the city's culture.
[04:07.72]Bitzinger said he and other owners
[04:11.48]had long campaigned
[04:13.24]for the UNESCO recognition.
[04:15.60]"The special thing about it
[04:18.44]is that it's a form of gastronomy
[04:21.60]everybody can afford."
[04:23.96]Bitzinger added,
[04:26.04]"Here the general director
[04:28.08]and, during the opera ball,
[04:30.56]a celebrity stands next to a worker
[04:33.84]and the street sweeper
[04:35.68]who just finished cleaning the street.
[04:38.72]That unites people."
