<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Turkey's Erdogan Threatens Boycott of US Goods]

。
[00:00.12]Turkey's President threatened Tuesday to boycott U.S. electronic goods
[00:07.52]because of what he calls an economic war against Turkey by the United States.
[00:17.20]President Erdogan told political supporters in Ankara
[00:22.40]that he would start "a boycott against America's electronic goods."
[00:28.88]He urged Turks to buy local or Korean mobile phones,
[00:34.64]instead of American iPhones.
[00:38.68]Erdogan, however, did not announce any government action towards a boycott.
[00:46.64]The president's comments came after diplomats from both sides
[00:52.00]met Monday to calm tensions.
[00:56.96]The call for a boycott appears to be Erdogan's answer to the U.S. decision
[01:03.76]to double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports.
[01:09.96]In addition, the U.S. has placed sanctions on two Turkish ministers
[01:16.84]over the arrest of an American pastor who is charged with having links to terrorism.
[01:26.28]Erdogan also has called on people to exchange their U.S. dollars for Turkish lira
[01:34.44]to help strengthen the exchange value of the country's currency.
[01:40.12]"If we divert our money to foreign currency...
[01:45.24]then we will be in the position of having surrendered to the devil," Erdogan said.
[01:53.16]The dispute between the U.S. and Turkey
[01:56.76]has started an economic crisis in Turkey
[02:00.32]that has pushed its currency to historic lows.
[02:05.52]The exchange value of the lira has fallen about 40 percent
[02:11.16]against the U.S. dollar since January.
[02:15.76]Last week it dropped 16 percent in one day.
[02:22.40]However, severe changes in the value of the currency calmed Tuesday
[02:28.76]after news that U.S. national security adviser John Bolton
[02:34.52]had met with the Turkish ambassador to Washington Monday.
[02:40.08]International investors are worried about Turkey's high amount of debt
[02:45.92]held in foreign currencies, especially the dollar.
[02:50.79]Most economists say Erdogan should raise interest rates to support the Turkish lira,
[02:58.64]but Erdogan wants to keep rates low to support growth.
[03:04.76]Investors are also worried about the effects of the dispute
[03:09.44]between two NATO allies.
[03:13.28]In a statement released Tuesday, Turkish business groups called on Erdogan
[03:19.32]to let the Turkish central bank raise interest rates to stop the currency crisis.
[03:27.16]They also called on Turkey to work with the United States to improve relations.
[03:35.64]The Turkish central bank has promised that Turkish banks will have all the money they need.
[03:43.28]But, foreign investors are concerned that the central bank
[03:47.84]may not act because of political interference.
[03:52.92]Central banks try to ignore politics when making economic decisions.
[03:59.64]In the case of the American pastor, the lawyer representing Andrew Brunson
[04:05.68]again asked a Turkish court to release him from house arrest.
[04:12.16]The 50-year-old pastor is charged with terrorism links and spying.
[04:19.52]He denies the charges.
[04:22.52]Brunson faces a possible prison sentence of 35 years.
