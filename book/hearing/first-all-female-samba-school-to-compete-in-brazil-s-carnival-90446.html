。
[00:00.04]In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Carnival is back.
[00:05.28]The Carnival is a week-long celebration marking
[00:09.36]the beginning of the Easter season in the Catholic church.
[00:14.72]Brazil's federal government expects 46 million people
[00:19.72]to join the festivities that officially begin Friday
[00:24.60]and run through Feb. 22.
[00:28.68]It features many parades filled with music and samba dancing.
[00:34.28]Among them is a group
[00:36.40]from Turma da Paz de Madureira, or TPM, samba school.
[00:43.56]What makes TPM special is that
[00:46.80]it is the city's first all-female samba school.
[00:51.28]In Brazil, it is rare for women to be leaders of samba groups.
[00:57.96]"The big samba schools are coordinated by men,
[01:01.52]which means women are used to receiving orders,"
[01:05.76]said Barbara Rigaud.
[01:08.08]She is the 54-year-old leader of the new TPM samba school.
[01:15.44]"Here, a woman can express her desires, her ideas,
[01:19.92]her opinions . . . it is empowering, " Rigaud added.
[01:25.60]TPM started in 2011 as a bloco,
[01:30.04]the name for musical groups that play in the streets
[01:33.96]during the Carnival season.
[01:36.80]Rigaud decided she wanted to take the women-only group further
[01:42.12]and compete in the city's samba leagues.
[01:45.92]She won approval from city officials
[01:49.20]and the school was opened last September.
[01:52.40]It now has 320 members.
[01:56.24]However, the group is still a target of insults from some men.
[02:02.80]Gisele Rosires is one of several TPM drummers.
[02:07.52]"Men look me up and down, they think I'm not capable," she said.
[02:13.60]She remembered her first performance with the school
[02:17.32]a year and a half ago in Madureira's park.
[02:21.76]A man took the instrument from her
[02:24.96]and said, "You're a woman, get out."
[02:28.96]In Brazil, women make up the majority of the population,
[02:33.96]but they hold few positions of leadership
[02:37.04]in government and business.
[02:39.00]Women won only 18 percent of Lower House seats
[02:44.12]in the National Congress
[02:46.32]and an even smaller percentage in the Senate.
[02:51.84]Meanwhile, sexual attack and harassment
[02:55.28]continue to happen at Carnival's street parties.
[02:59.20]However, over the last ten years, women have pushed back
[03:04.12]and spread the message "No means No!"
[03:08.48]For their first parade, on Feb. 19,
[03:12.56]TPM will honor Iansa,
[03:16.08]a female warrior of Candomblé.
[03:20.12]But parade rules require two men to lead the parade.
[03:25.68]Rigaud noted that "It has to be a man for now,
[03:30.64]until it changes, until this machismo ends."
[03:36.16]TPM will compete in Rio's lowest-level samba league.
[03:41.92]If the women perform well enough,
[03:44.36]they can climb to a higher level for next year's parade.
[03:49.40]Already, Rigaud wants to reach the Sambodrome,
[03:55.24]where only the top schools compete.
