[00:00.00]Dong Tao chicken has been a food of choice
[00:05.67]for generations in Vietnam for the Lunar New Year, or Tet.
[00:11.87]The rare bird is known for its strangely large feet.
[00:16.81]It is also known as a "dragon chicken."
[00:20.75]The chicken gets its name from the village of Dong Tao,
[00:25.62]about 30 kilometers southeast of Hanoi.
[00:30.38]Dong Tao chickens are believed
[00:33.56]to bring good luck and wealth to their owners.

[00:51.64]That demand comes

[01:06.53]He told Reuters that a fully-grown Dong Tao chicken
[01:11.12]at one year old sells for $200
[01:15.57]and sometimes as much as $400.
[01:20.23]The demand for Dong Tao chicken
[01:23.52]is also fueled by its rich taste.
[01:27.27]Loc Duc Toan is a 25-year-old cook in Hanoi.
[01:32.96]Toan said a Dong Tao chicken has its best taste
[01:37.99]at the age of 13 to 15 months.
[01:42.44]"When steamed, the skin will be crispy
