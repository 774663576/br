In a brain death, machines can keep the body breathing and can provide oxygen to organs until they can be recovered and put on ice.
目前，大多数移植心脏来自于已被宣布脑死亡的捐赠者。脑死亡是指一个人在遭受严重伤害后不再具有大脑功能的迹象。在脑死亡中，机器可以维持身体呼吸，并为器官提供氧气，直到它们被取出并放在冰块上面。</p>

移植医生雅各布·施罗德告诉美联社：“老实说，如果我们能打个响指，就能让人们使用这种疗法，我认为它可能会上升得更多。”他说：“这真的应该成为治疗的标准。”</p>
<p>With the new method, doctors can remove hearts in circulatory deaths and put them in a machine that "reanimates" them.

有了这种新方法，医生可以提取循环系统死亡的心脏，并将其放入机器中使其“复苏”。这种方法会在运输过程中将血液和营养物质输送到心脏。这些器官还能在移植前进行检测，以确保它们的有效功能。</p>
<p>The study involved multiple hospitals around the country, as well as 180 transplant patients. Half the patients received DCD hearts and half were given hearts from brain-dead donors that were transported on ice.<br/>

<p>In the U.S. last year, 4,111 heart transplants were performed. While this was a record number, it is not nearly enough to meet the need. Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from advanced heart failure but many are never offered a transplant. Still others die waiting for one.<br/>
去年，美国共进行了4111例心脏移植手术。虽然这是一个创纪录的数字，但远远不足以满足需求。数十万人患有晚期心力衰竭，但许多人从未接受过移植手术。还有一些人在等待中死亡。</p>

。
[00:00.04]Researchers say a new method for heart transplants
[00:05.16]could increase the number of available organs
[00:09.44]and save more lives.
[00:12.32]Currently, most transplanted hearts
[00:15.88]come from donors who have been declared brain dead.
[00:20.40]This means the person no longer has signs of brain function
[00:25.96]after suffering a serious injury.
[00:29.08]In a brain death, machines can keep the body breathing
[00:34.24]and can provide oxygen to organs
[00:37.88]until they can be recovered and put on ice.
[00:42.52]But the new method would take hearts from medical cases
[00:47.48]known as circulatory deaths.
[00:50.68]These cases are also known as donation
[00:55.72]after circulatory death, or DCD.
[01:00.68]Circulatory deaths happen when a person
[01:04.96]has a nonsurvivable brain injury,
[01:08.72]but still has some brain function.
[01:12.12]In these cases, family members can decide
[01:16.28]to withdraw all life support measures.
[01:19.88]This means organs go without oxygen for a time
[01:24.80]before they can be recovered.
[01:27.48]Currently, kidneys and some other organs
[01:31.32]are taken from people suffering circulatory deaths.
[01:36.04]But doctors have resisted using hearts
[01:40.16]because of possible organ damage from a lack of oxygen.
[01:45.04]A new study suggests that hearts might also be recoverable
[01:51.16]from cases of circulatory deaths.
[01:54.68]Researchers at North Carolina's
[01:57.92]Duke University School of Medicine led the study,
[02:02.16]which was recently published
[02:04.48]in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[02:07.52]The researchers said using hearts from circulatory deaths
[02:13.68]could possibly give thousands more patients
[02:17.52]a chance at a lifesaving transplant.
[02:20.84]And it could increase the number of donor hearts by 30 percent.
[02:27.56]"Honestly if we could snap our fingers
[02:31.40]and just get people to use this,
[02:34.28]I think it probably would go up even more than that,"
[02:38.48]transplant doctor Jacob Schroder told The Associated Press.
[02:44.52]"This really should be standard of care," he said.
[02:49.44]With the new method,
[02:51.80]doctors can remove hearts in circulatory deaths
[02:56.36]and put them in a machine that "reanimates" them.
[03:01.16]This process pumps blood and nutrients through the heart
[03:06.52]as they are being transported.
[03:09.16]The organs can also be tested to make sure
[03:13.16]they are effectively functioning before they are transplanted.
[03:18.44]The study involved multiple hospitals around the country,
[03:24.08]as well as 180 transplant patients.
[03:28.40]Half the patients received DCD hearts
[03:32.80]and half were given hearts from brain-dead donors
[03:36.88]that were transported on ice.
[03:39.84]Survival rates six months later
[03:43.60]were about the same – 94 percent
[03:47.00]for recipients of cardiac-death donations
[03:51.04]and 90 percent for those who got the usual hearts,
[03:56.28]the researchers reported.
[03:58.96]The findings are exciting and show the possibility
[04:04.08]"to increase fairness and equity
[04:07.48]in heart transplantation..." said Dr. Nancy Sweitzer.
[04:12.84]She is a heart transplant specialist
[04:16.04]at Washington University in St. Louis.
[04:20.04]Sweitzer, who was not part of the study,
[04:23.64]said she thinks the new method will permit more people
[04:28.24]with heart failure to receive lifesaving treatment.
[04:33.12]In the U.S. last year, 4,111 heart transplants were performed.
[04:42.48]While this was a record number,
[04:44.68]it is not nearly enough to meet the need.
[04:48.20]Hundreds of thousands of people
[04:50.84]suffer from advanced heart failure
[04:53.76]but many are never offered a transplant.
[04:57.48]Still others die waiting for one.
