。
[00:00.04]This year's results on a U.S. college admissions test
[00:04.04]are the lowest they have been in 30 years.
[00:07.48]Experts say the results are the latest evidence
[00:11.60]of learning interference caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:16.32]The American College Test, or ACT,
[00:20.68]is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States.
[00:27.64]The ACT is administered by a nonprofit organization of the same name.
[00:33.56]The class of 2022 average ACT score was 19.8 out of 36.
[00:41.64]It marks the first time since 1991
[00:45.00]that the average score was below 20.
[00:49.12]In addition, an increasing number of high school students
[00:53.48]failed to meet any of the subject-area benchmarks,
[00:58.08]or targets, set by the ACT.
[01:01.60]This shows a drop in preparedness for college-level studies.
[01:08.16]The test results were made public in a report on Wednesday.
[01:12.28]The report shows that 42 percent of ACT-tested graduates
[01:17.96]in the class of 2022 met none of the subject benchmarks
[01:24.24]in English, reading, science, and math.
[01:29.36]These benchmarks are considered predictions
[01:33.40]for how students might perform in college classes.
[01:37.92]In 2021, 38 percent of ACT test takers
[01:45.32]failed to meet any of the benchmarks.
[01:49.76]"Academic preparedness
[01:51.76]is where we are seeing the decline," said Rose Babington.
[01:55.60]She is senior director for state partnerships for the ACT.
[02:01.16]ACT scores have been dropping steadily in recent years.
[02:06.28]However, the large drop during this past year
[02:10.68]is "particularly alarming,"
[02:13.00]said ACT chief executive officer Janet Godwin.
[02:17.96]Godwin added, "We see rapidly growing numbers of seniors
[02:23.12]leaving high school without meeting college-readiness benchmarks
[02:28.04]in any of the subjects we measure."
[02:31.80]The results also offer a look into systemic unfairness
[02:36.68]in education that existed before the pandemic closed schools.
[02:42.16]For example, students who are not
[02:45.00]offered high-level classes in high school
[02:47.96]suffered more during the pandemic, Babington said.
[02:51.64]Those students usually are from rural areas

[03:02.16]The number of high school students taking the ACT
[03:05.44]has dropped 30 percent since 2018.
[03:09.80]That is because high school graduates
[03:12.12]are increasingly not going to college.
[03:15.52]Also, some universities no longer require
[03:19.84]standardized test scores for admission.
[03:24.72]Standardized tests such as the ACT have faced growing concerns
[03:31.60]that they are unfair to minority and low-income students.
[03:37.68]Students who take costly test preparation classes
[03:42.16]or advanced classes in high school often perform better.
[03:48.24]Babington defended the test as a measure of college readiness.
[03:53.84]"Now more than ever, the last few years have shown us
[03:57.60]the importance of having high-quality data
[04:00.96]to help inform how we support students," Babington said.
[04:06.88]Colleges and universities are increasingly ending
[04:11.36]long-standing requirements for standardized tests.
[04:15.68]The University of California system
[04:18.32]even has a "test-blind" policy.
[04:21.64]This means that test scores
[04:25.00]are not considered even if they are supplied.
[04:29.08]But many students still take the tests.
[04:32.28]If their scores are high,
[04:34.56]they may have an advantage over other students.

[05:00.12]Jordan said he wants to study mechanical engineering.
