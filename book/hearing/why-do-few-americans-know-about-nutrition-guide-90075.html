。
[00:01.32]Only one in four Americans
[00:04.48]know about the most recent government effort
[00:08.68]to get people to eat a healthy diet.
[00:13.28]That information comes from a study released Tuesday
[00:18.28]by the National Center for Health Statistics.
[00:23.48]The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
[00:29.36]introduced the logo, an image
[00:33.36]representing healthy eating, in 2011.
[00:38.52]It is called MyPlate.
[00:41.92]The image replaced the food pyramid logo
[00:46.36]the USDA used from 1992 to 2011.
[00:54.24]Nutrition experts criticized the food pyramid
[00:58.52]for placing too much importance on carbohydrates
[01:03.92]from grains and not enough importance on fats.
[01:09.88]MyPlate uses a dinner plate
[01:12.72]with four colored sections for fruit,
[01:16.72]vegetables, grain and protein,
[01:20.76]with a smaller circle for dairy products,
[01:25.60]such as low-fat milk or yogurt.
[01:30.60]It encourages Americans
[01:33.12]to make half of their meals fruits and vegetables.
[01:39.24]The study also found that about 10 percent of Americans
[01:45.12]had tried to follow the guidance of MyPlate.
[01:50.76]That means the program that costs about $3 million a year
[01:57.08]has not reached a big majority of Americans.
[02:03.64]Diet-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes
[02:09.12]and heart disease have continued to rise
[02:13.32]since MyPlate was introduced.
[02:17.72]"This is currently the primary education tool
[02:22.24]that communicates guidelines for Americans,"
[02:26.04]said the study's lead writer, Edwina Wambogo.
[02:32.40]She is a nutrition expert at the health information agency.
[02:38.96]"MyPlate should be doing a little bit better."
[02:43.48]Marion Nestle, a food policy expert,
[02:47.92]said the MyPlate program does not include an education program
[02:53.96]and does not deal with many foods Americans eat.
[03:00.64]A USDA official said the agency's proposed 2023 budget
[03:08.92]aims to increase spending on the program
[03:13.44]from $3 million to $10 million a year.
[03:20.36]The idea is to help the MyPlate program reach more people.
[03:27.80]The recent study said people who called their diet excellent,
[03:33.88]very good or good were more likely to have heard of MyPlate
[03:42.16]than those who said their diet was fair or poor.
[03:49.40]Dr. Vijaya Surampudi is a nutrition specialist
[03:54.80]at the University of California, Los Angeles.
[04:00.60]She said MyPlate leaves out important details about fats
[04:06.80]and the differences between vegetables.
[04:11.32]And Nestle noted that MyPlate fails to show that vegetables,
[04:17.60]grains, and dairy foods also contain protein.
[04:24.60]The new study advises more research into why some groups
[04:30.28]are less likely to know about and follow government guidance.
[04:37.12]It also said additional research was needed
[04:41.76]to find out how best to reach people with poor diets.
[04:49.32]But the answer is not so simple, Surampudi suggested.
[04:56.12]People know now that they should eat more fruit and vegetables.
[05:03.04]Beyond that, the message gets less clear.
[05:09.12]"The minute it gets a little confusing, people shut down," she said.
