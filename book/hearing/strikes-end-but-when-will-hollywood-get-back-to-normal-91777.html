[00:00.04]Hollywood actors reached a deal
[00:03.12]to end their four-month strike this week.
[00:06.68]But it could take some time
[00:09.56]before you will see your favorite actors
[00:12.48]on television and in movies again.
[00:15.88]The deal permits many actors, writers
[00:19.24]and technicians to get back to work.
[00:22.76]And movies and television programs,
[00:26.28]such as Deadpool, Abbott Elementary,
[00:29.92]and The Last of Us,
[00:32.04]are one step closer to returning.
[00:35.08]The writers and technicians approved
[00:38.20]their contract in September
[00:40.36]after a four-month strike.
[00:42.88]The actors still have to vote on the deal
[00:46.96]that their labor union leaders made on Wednesday.
[00:50.84]The full terms are not yet available,
[00:53.92]but leaders say the new deal includes
[00:57.80]pay increases of more than $1 billion.
[01:01.60]It also covers concerns
[01:04.24]such as pay for streaming video
[01:07.28]and protections for the use of artificial intelligence
[01:10.88]in creating video and audio.
[01:13.80]The group that represents
[01:16.20]producers of television and movies
[01:19.00]said the agreement "represents a new paradigm."
[01:23.12]The head of the actor's group is Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
[01:28.00]He said the agreement
[01:30.00]is one "our members can be proud of."
[01:32.72]Here are some questions and answers:
[01:36.44]What programs will start filming first?
[01:40.16]The strike put an immediate stop
[01:43.52]to the filming of Deadpool 3
[01:46.00]with Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.
[01:49.00]That movie and a new Gladiator
[01:52.28]will likely get back to production first.
[01:55.64]In television, shows such as Abbott Elementary,
[01:59.56]The White Lotus and Yellowjackets
[02:02.76]should start filming again.
[02:04.92]Writers for those programs started working
[02:08.36]when their strike ended earlier this year.
[02:11.00]However, some films and television programs
[02:15.36]recently announced delays.
[02:17.56]They include Yellowstone with Kevin Costner
[02:21.44]and the next Mission Impossible movie.
[02:24.84]What other changes are coming?
[02:27.80]Actors who were on strike did not sit for interviews
[02:31.48]or talk about their movies and television shows.
[02:34.28]As a result, some movies did not get a lot of marketing.
[02:39.00]One of the actors in the new movie
[02:41.24]Killers of the Flower Moon is Lily Gladstone.
[02:45.20]She will now be able to talk about her big role
[02:48.68]in the movie which also includes Leonardo DiCaprio.
[02:53.20]What about the big awards shows?
[02:56.44]The Academy Awards, better known as the Oscars,
[03:00.08]will be back on as usual in 2024.
[03:03.48]The awards shows will run
[03:05.72]from mid-January through early March.
[03:08.44]Are there any more strikes ahead?
[03:11.80]Some strikes could come in the future.
[03:14.56]Actors who work on video games
[03:17.80]have approved a strike if negotiations do not work out.
[03:21.88]Many actors give their voices
[03:24.16]and images to video game companies.
[03:27.16]They are concerned that their voices and faces
[03:30.92]could be used without their permission in the future.
[03:33.88]Another strike could include the people
[03:36.92]who work behind the scenes in television and movies.
[03:40.88]Those workers do things such as
[03:43.76]plan the lighting and create the sets.
[03:47.24]Their union said its workers have missed out on a lot of money
[03:51.64]as film and television projects shut down in 2023.
[03:56.96]In addition, people who appear on
[03:59.72]reality television programs such as The Bachelor
[04:03.28]or The Real Housewives
[04:05.44]have started talking about forming a union.
[04:08.52]The people who appear on those programs
[04:11.00]do not have a labor group and many have talked about
[04:13.88]difficult working conditions and long days.
