。
[00:00.04]An illustrated edition of Margaret Atwood's book
[00:03.60]The Handmaid's Tale was released in 2019.
[00:07.28]The book is widely considered a classic work
[00:11.08]about the oppression of women.
[00:13.12]An illustrated version of the book
[00:16.04]would help it reach teens who struggle with words alone.
[00:20.52]Educators in Clayton, Missouri, needed little debate
[00:24.56]before deciding to keep copies of the book
[00:27.16]in high school libraries.
[00:29.88]But Missouri legislators passed a law in 2022
[00:34.08]punishing librarians with fines and possible imprisonment
[00:38.56]for permitting sexually explicit materials on bookshelves.
[00:42.72]The school system reconsidered the new Atwood edition
[00:47.04]and later removed it from libraries.
[00:51.12]Across the country, book bans
[00:53.40]and attempted book bans are becoming more common.
[00:56.64]Public and school-based libraries
[01:00.08]have seen a rise in complaints
[01:02.40]from community members and conservative activists.
[01:07.00]Now, some lawmakers are considering adding new threats:
[01:11.16]legal action, high fines, and even imprisonment
[01:15.16]for distributing books that some consider
[01:17.80]to be obscene or inappropriate.
[01:20.00]Obscene means related to sex in an offensive way.
[01:26.52]No librarian or educator has been jailed yet.
[01:30.00]But the possibility of punishment
[01:32.88]has led to more self-censorship.
[01:35.88]Already this year, lawmakers in more than 15 states
[01:39.52]have introduced bills
[01:41.24]to place severe penalties on libraries or librarians.
[01:47.32]Utah passed legislation in March
[01:49.92]that empowers the state's Attorney General
[01:52.84]to enforce a new system
[01:55.04]that can remove "sensitive" books from schools.
[02:00.04]In Idaho, lawmakers are considering a bill
[02:03.72]that empowers local prosecutors
[02:06.40]to bring legal action against public and school libraries
[02:10.96]if they do not keep "harmful" materials away from children.
[02:16.32]Deborah Caldwell-Stone is director
[02:19.00]of the American Library Association's Office
[02:22.08]for Intellectual Freedom.
[02:23.64]She said, "The laws are designed to limit
[02:27.64]or remove legal protections
[02:29.88]that libraries have had for decades."
[02:34.64]Since the early 1960s,
[02:36.88]places like schools, libraries and museums
[02:40.92]have largely been safe
[02:42.68]from costly lawsuits or criminal charges.
[02:46.16]Educators, librarians and other workers
[02:49.88]who give out materials to children have also been safe.
[02:55.64]These protections began appearing in states
[02:58.64]as American lawmakers and others
[03:01.44]debated standards surrounding obscenity.
[03:04.84]The term was defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973.
[03:11.32]The high court justices found that the First Amendment
[03:15.20]does not automatically protect obscene materials.
[03:19.32]For something to be "obscene,"
[03:21.12]it must meet three requirements.
[03:23.96]One requirement is that the work must lack
[03:27.32]"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."
[03:33.40]Over time, almost every American state
[03:36.68]created protections for educators,
[03:39.24]librarians and museum officials.
[03:42.92]This prevented "prosecutions of teachers
[03:45.92]over health and sexuality curriculum,
[03:49.04]art, theater, and difficult subjects in English classes,"
[03:53.88]says a 2023 report from EveryLibrary.
[03:58.64]The group, a national political action committee,
[04:01.64]opposes censorship.
[04:05.32]But last year, Arkansas and Indiana
[04:08.88]targeted educators and librarians with criminalization laws.
[04:13.68]And the state of Tennessee criminalized publishers
[04:18.36]that provide "obscene" materials to public schools.
[04:23.32]Indiana lawmakers took away "educational purposes"
[04:27.36]as a defense for school librarians and educators
[04:31.16]charged with giving minors "obscene" or "harmful" material.
[04:36.04]Doing so are crimes punishable by up two and half years in jail
[04:41.40]and $10,000 in fines.
[04:44.40]The law requires public lists of what is in each school library.
[04:50.68]It also requires libraries to set up a system
[04:53.88]to respond to complaints about the available materials.
[04:58.52]Indiana's law took effect January 1.
[05:03.92]Diane Rogers is a school librarian who serves as president
[05:08.24]of the Indiana Library Federation.
[05:11.96]She said of the new law,
[05:13.88]"It's putting fear into some people. It's very scary."
[05:18.36]She added that teachers who face charges
[05:21.88]because of the new law
[05:23.44]could lose their right to teach,
[05:25.52]even if they are found innocent.
