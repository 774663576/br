。
[00:00.12]United States President Donald Trump repeated his ‘America First' message
[00:07.96]in a speech Friday to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
[00:14.76]But he said although his policies seek to put America first,
[00:22.24]this "does not mean America alone."
[00:27.40]"When the United States grows, so does the world," Trump said.
[00:33.30]He added that U.S. economic growth, creativity and innovation
[00:40.44]has led to the creation of "countless jobs around the globe."
[00:47.64]The World Economic Forum is a not-for-profit organization established in 1971.
[00:57.12]The yearly meeting is attended by world political and business leaders,
[01:03.16]including many heads of state.
[01:07.84]Trump's comments about his ‘America First' policies
[01:12.48]were expected at the gathering.
[01:16.16]But some experts were unsure how the theme would be received:
[01:21.48]the Davos meeting traditionally centers on global economic growth.
[01:29.48]Trump said the U.S. economy had improved
[01:33.04]during his first year in office.
[01:36.32]He pointed to the creation of 2.4 million jobs,
[01:41.44]dropping unemployment rates and record highs in the stock market.
[01:47.84]This growth, Trump said, had created a great chance for global investment in America.
[01:55.78]"I'm here to deliver a simple message:
[01:59.48]There has never been a better time to hire,
[02:02.52]to build, to invest and to grow in the United States.
[02:05.92]America is open for business and we are competitive once again."
[02:13.20]However, Trump said he believes the current international trading system is unfair.
[02:21.72]He said it does not reward nations that "play by the rules."
[02:28.32]"We cannot have free and open trade
[02:32.52]if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others.
[02:37.52]We support free trade, but it needs to be fair,  and it needs to be reciprocal.
[02:46.96]Because in the end, unfair trade undermines us all."
[02:52.80]Trump also spoke about the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.
[03:00.32]The U.S. president said he is willing to negotiate trade deals individually
[03:06.56]or as a group with nations in that agreement.
[03:12.12]Last year, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
[03:17.92]which includes 11 Pacific area nations.
[03:22.32]Trump said the U.S. already has agreements with several member nations.
[03:29.20]He added that the U.S. would consider negotiating with others,
[03:34.16]as long as "it is in all of our interests."
[03:39.48]Before his trip to Davos, Trump signed an executive order
[03:44.44]that placed import taxes on washing machines and solar panels.
[03:50.48]The order calls for a 30 percent tax on imported solar panels.
[03:57.08]A 20 percent tax will be placed on the first
[04:00.44]1.2 million imported washers in the first year.
[04:06.28]A 50 percent tax will be placed on additional imported washers.
[04:12.88]China and South Korea quickly condemned the action.
[04:18.08]U.S. solar industry officials also criticized the move.
[04:23.56]They predicted the new import taxes
[04:26.56]would lead to thousands of job losses and price increases.
[04:32.80]While at the Davos meeting,
[04:35.00]Trump also held talks with the leaders of Britain,
[04:38.84]Israel, Switzerland and Rwanda.
