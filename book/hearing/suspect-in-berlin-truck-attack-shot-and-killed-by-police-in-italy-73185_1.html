。
[00:01.68]The suspected driver in the deadly truck attack
[00:06.68]at a Christmas market in Germany
[00:10.04]was shot and killed Friday by police in Italy.
[00:16.52]The 24-year-old Tunisian man, Anis Amri,
[00:22.60]was killed during a shootout with two police officers in Milan.
[00:30.08]Amri pulled out a gun and shot one officer in the arm
[00:36.44]after he was asked to show identification papers during a normal patrol.
[00:44.48]German officials said they had confirmed through fingerprints
[00:51.20]that the man killed in Milan was the suspect in Monday's truck attack.
[00:58.76]Amri is suspected of hijacking the truck and killing its driver
[01:05.40]before driving into a Christmas market in central Berlin.
[01:11.36]The attack killed 12 people and injured more than 50 others.
[01:19.44]Police said they found documents belonging to Amri inside the truck.
[01:26.24]Before Amri was identified as the main suspect,
[01:32.24]police detained a Pakistani man for possible involvement in the attack.
[01:40.04]He was later cleared and released.
[01:44.28]Germany's head prosecutor told reporters the investigation is continuing.
[01:52.32]He added that it is not yet known whether other suspects
[01:57.72]might have helped carry out the attack.
[02:01.72]The Islamic State (IS) said the attacker was inspired
[02:09.32]by its call for people to strike members of a coalition
[02:14.60]fighting the militant group in Syria and Iraq.
[02:19.56]In a video posted by IS's Amaq news agency,
[02:25.40]Amri pledged his allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
[02:33.24]He also urged others to carry out attacks
[02:37.20]on "Crusaders who are striking Muslims daily."
[02:41.88]He added: "I swear to God that we will come to slaughter you, you pigs."
[02:48.76]Officials say Amri arrived in Germany in July 2015,
[02:55.88]after serving time in jail in Italy for setting fire to a refugee shelter.
[03:04.48]He sought asylum in Germany but the request was denied.
[03:10.60]Authorities said he could not be sent back to Tunisia
[03:15.52]because he had no passport and that country had refused to accept him.
[03:21.92]German Chancellor Angela Merkel has ordered an investigation into the policies
[03:30.88]that resulted in Amri staying in the country so long.
[03:36.68]Merkel is facing increasing political pressure in Germany
[03:41.88]to take a stronger position on immigration and asylum policies.
[03:48.08]Her popularity has dropped since Germany opened its border
[03:53.04]to accept about one million refugees.
[03:57.28]I'm John Russell.
