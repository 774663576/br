。
[00:00.04]Google has agreed to destroy
[00:03.52]billions of personal data records
[00:07.04]to settle a lawsuit that accused
[00:09.80]the company of secretly following users' internet activity.
[00:16.08]The lawsuit was considered a class-action.
[00:20.52]This means the case was brought by an individual or small group,
[00:26.36]but with many others wanting to be part of the action.
[00:31.08]Lawyers first announced the settlement agreement in December.
[00:36.44]But details were not released until recently.
[00:41.04]The case covered millions of people who used
[00:45.52]Google's internet browser Chrome
[00:48.68]beginning June 1, 2016.
[00:52.08]Google is accused of continuing to follow
[00:56.40]Chrome users' internet activity
[00:59.40]even when they were browsing
[01:01.96]under a privacy setting called "incognito."
[01:06.36]Users accused Google of misleading them
[01:10.80]into believing their internet activity
[01:13.96]would not be recorded
[01:15.72]while they browsed in "incognito."
[01:18.92]The users argued Google's advertising system
[01:23.92]continued to collect data on users' web movements
[01:28.48]while Chrome was set to "incognito."
[01:31.84]Google strongly fought the accusations.
[01:36.04]It had requested a dismissal of the case,
[01:39.60]but the request was denied.
[01:42.00]The settlement terms were negotiated
[01:45.44]over a four-month period.
[01:47.76]The deal must still receive
[01:50.88]final approval from a federal judge
[01:53.88]during a hearing set for July 30 in Oakland, California.
[01:59.44]The settlement requires Google
[02:02.80]to destroy billions of personal records
[02:06.12]stored in its data centers.
[02:09.16]It also orders the company to provide
[02:12.68]more guidance about its privacy policies
[02:16.40]for people using Chrome.
[02:18.60]And it calls for tools
[02:21.24]to limit Google's collection of personal data.
[02:25.04]Individuals represented in the class-action lawsuit
[02:29.92]will not receive any damages
[02:32.64]or other payments as part of the settlement.
[02:36.36]But the deal does not prevent individual users
[02:41.08]from pushing their own civil cases
[02:44.08]against the company in U.S. state courts.
[02:48.48]In a statement, Google said
[02:51.28]it was "pleased to settle this lawsuit."
[02:54.72]Lawyers representing the Chrome users
[02:58.48]described the settlement as
[03:01.00]a major win for personal privacy
[03:04.40]in a world with ever-increasing levels of digital surveillance.
[03:10.16]Lawyers in the case valued the settlement
[03:13.92]at $4.75 billion to $7.8 billion.
[03:20.04]They explained they arrived at that number
[03:23.56]based mainly on what possible ad sales
[03:27.52]linked to the personal data collected
[03:30.44]might have earned without new restrictions.
[03:34.28]Austin Chambers is a lawyer
[03:37.48]who specializes in data privacy issues at Dorsey &amp; Whitney.
[03:42.84]He told The Associated Press
[03:45.64]that he sees the settlement as a "welcome development."
[03:50.24]He said it could affect the way
[03:53.08]personal information is collected online in the future.
[03:57.64]Chambers said, "This prevents companies
[04:01.68]from profiting off of that data,
[04:04.52]and also requires them to undertake
[04:07.80]complex and costly data deletion efforts."
[04:12.64]Google still faces legal threats linked to other issues.
[04:17.72]Legal experts say those threats
[04:20.60]could end up having a much bigger effect
[04:23.40]on its advertising-based businesses.
[04:26.80]One of those cases argues
[04:29.76]that Google is abusing its influence
[04:33.04]in internet advertising to limit competition.
[04:37.08]Closing arguments are set to be begin in that case on May 1.
[04:42.68]Google is also facing possible changes to its app store
[04:48.56]after an American jury found the store operates
[04:52.76]as an illegal monopoly.
[04:55.52]A hearing examining possible changes Google must make
[05:00.52]is set to begin in late May.
