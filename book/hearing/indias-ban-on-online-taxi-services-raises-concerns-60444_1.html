[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:04.60]The Indian government recently 
[00:07.38]called for all unregistered taxi services to halt operations. 
[00:12.52]The order came after the reported rape 
[00:15.80]of a woman by a driver for the company Uber 
[00:19.15]in the capital New Delhi. 
[00:21.04]Uber uses a mobile app to link drivers and people seeking a ride.
[00:27.16]A statement from Uber said 
[00:30.05]the company will "work with the government of India 
[00:33.58]to establish clear background checks currently absent 
[00:38.16]in their commercial transportation licensing programs."
[00:42.34]The incident has brought attention 
[00:45.52]to the issue of rules for mobile service businesses. 
[00:49.21]The issue has grown more important with the expansion 
[00:53.55]of what is called the "sharing economy."
[00:56.45]Uber has been expanding quickly. 
[00:59.88]The company says it operates in over 200 cities 
[01:04.61]and over 50 countries around the world. 
[01:07.55]Its fast growth has led financial experts 
[01:11.84]to value the company in the billions of dollars. 
[01:14.68]However, Uber's expansion has placed it in competition 
[01:20.40]with existing taxi services 
[01:22.80]and caused some cities and countries 
[01:26.03]to ban the ride-sharing service.
[01:28.82]Uber has faced or is facing bans in Germany, 
[01:34.81]Spain, India and Thailand. 
[01:38.34]Franch recently said it plans to block Uber services 
[01:42.93]that use non professional drivers. 
[01:45.57]In the U.S., opposition is widespread but uneven.
[01:50.95]In Pennsylvania, for example, UberX, 
[01:55.64]a low-cost ride-sharing service from Uber 
[01:59.42]can operate anywhere except the state's largest city Philadelphia. 
[02:04.70]There, Uber Black, a more expensive limousine service from Uber, 
[02:10.73]and other taxi services legally operate 
[02:14.21]with licenses from the Philadelphia Parking Authority.
[02:18.29]The sharing economy permits individuals 
[02:22.37]to rent things they own such as a car or an extra room 
[02:27.30]to people anywhere using mobile apps. 
[02:30.44]Even payment is through an app.
[02:34.07]The issue is that these transactions 
[02:37.72]are not supervised the way taxi services or hotels are. 
[02:42.90]Critics say they can be unsafe. 
[02:45.83]Philadelphia Parking Authority director Vince Fenerty 
[02:49.86]calls the unregulated taxi services "hacks."
[02:53.75]"They are basically running what's called a hack taxicab service. 
[02:59.62]A totally unregulated service 
[03:02.32]which brings into question the safety of the passenger, 
[03:07.99]the credentials of the driver 
[03:11.38]and the mechanical workings of the vehicle. 
[03:15.91]They submit to nothing."
[03:18.70]Uber says on its website that every ridesharing driver 
[03:22.93]is investigated using a criminal background check. 
[03:26.56]But in the reported case in India, 
[03:29.55]the company is accused of not performing a check 
[03:33.19]of the driver's criminal record.
[03:35.18]Uber has been supporting changes in local laws to permit its service. 
[03:40.36]The city of Chicago has approved rules for a mobile app 
[03:45.17]to assist taxi services licensed by the city. 
[03:49.13]New York is considering a similar measure.
[03:52.71]And that's the Economics Report. I'm Mario Ritter.
