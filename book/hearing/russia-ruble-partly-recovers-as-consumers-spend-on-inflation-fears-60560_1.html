[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:04.70]The value of Russia's money 
[00:07.29]recently dropped by 20 percent in one day. 
[00:10.83]The ruble soon regains some of its value compared to the dollar. 
[00:16.11]However, the decreasing value of Russia's money 
[00:20.09]has raised fears in Moscow of rising prices.
[00:23.98]Russia's Central Bank has increased interest rates 
[00:28.48]to 17 percent in an effort to support the value of the currency. 
[00:33.92]Russian officials are seeking help 
[00:37.29]from some of the countries' biggest companies.
[00:40.33]In December, 
[00:42.02]Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev 
[00:45.02]met with the heads of export businesses, 
[00:48.30]including the energy companies Rosneft and Gazprom.
[00:53.20]He urged exporters to sell their foreign currency earnings, 
[00:58.30]rather than save them, 
[01:00.28]in an effort to support Russia's currency.
[01:03.38]But not everyone is hurt by the ruble's decrease. 
[01:07.92]Andrei Braginsky is a director of communications 
[01:12.85]for Moscow Exchange. 
[01:14.81]He says not all companies are suffering 
[01:18.75]because of the falling value of the ruble.
[01:22.01]"I think it really depends on company by company. 
[01:26.56]Those exporters that have revenue in foreign currency and, 
[01:32.62]of course, in rubles, 
[01:33.63]they are not actually suffering that significantly," Braginsky said.
[01:36.41]Russian exporters are paid in foreign currency, 
[01:40.57]and can make gains when the ruble's value is low. 
[01:44.31]Importers, however, 
[01:46.62]suffer the most when their currency decreases in value, 
[01:50.43]because foreign goods cost them more.
[01:53.93]The U.S. computer company Apple 
[01:57.63]halted online sales of its product in Russia 
[02:01.38]to prevent losses from the exchange rate 
[02:04.51]between the dollar and the ruble.
[02:06.66]Russians looking for goods at stores in Moscow 
[02:10.94]are buying them up because they are expecting price increases.
[02:15.78]"Now, consumers are buying hectically. 
[02:21.03]Because Russia largely [relies] on imported goods. 
[02:26.07]There are a lot of stocks which were brought 
[02:29.03]into the country at different currency levels. 
[02:31.10]So, people are buying iPhones, 
[02:33.14]they're buying imported cars, 
[02:35.07]and the clothes, 
[02:36.49]and everything they could buy still at old prices. 
[02:40.94]So, it's a -- short-term at least, 
[02:43.06]it's a consumer boom," Braginsky said.
[02:44.20]Financial experts say the ruble's drop in value 
[02:47.46]is not only affect the price buyers pay for goods. 
[02:51.22]It also makes it more difficult for Russian companies 
[02:55.73]to pay foreign debts. 
[02:57.24]This has caused concern that some Russian companies 
[03:01.76]may default or be unable to make their debt payments.
[03:05.83]Falling oil prices and Western restrictions 
[03:10.81]over Russia's actions in Ukraine 
[03:13.58]are some of the reasons that the ruble's value has dropped.
[03:17.61]In mid-December, 
[03:19.65]the European Union agreed to increase sanctions against Russia. 
[03:24.34]They include restrictions on finance and tourism in Crimea.
[03:30.01]But economists say Russia faces a more basic problem -- 
[03:35.64]its inability to use oil money to widen its economic activities 
[03:41.66]and gain foreign investment.
[03:44.25]And that is the Economics Report from VOA Learning English.
