。
[00:00.04]SpaceX has successfully completed
[00:04.20]a fifth test of its Starship rocket system.
[00:09.08]The uncrewed test was carried out Sunday
[00:13.64]at the American space company's
[00:16.28]launch center in Boca Chica, Texas.
[00:20.80]During the flight, the 121-meter-tall Starship
[00:26.76]was successfully pushed into space
[00:30.44]by a SpaceX Super Heavy booster rocket.
[00:34.92]After reaching a height, or altitude,
[00:39.12]of about 70 kilometers,
[00:41.56]the booster separated
[00:43.32]from Starship's second stage,
[00:46.16]or top half, as planned.
[00:49.68]The reuseable booster was then
[00:52.80]directed by ground controllers
[00:55.44]to return to the launch center.
[00:58.24]Before touching down on the landing pad,
[01:02.40]the rocket re-lit three of its 33 Raptor engines
[01:08.32]in order to slow the booster
[01:10.88]for a controlled landing.
[01:13.20]The Super Heavy then positioned itself to land.
[01:17.92]For the first time, the booster was "caught"
[01:21.96]and secured in place
[01:24.24]by a huge structure that includes large metal arms.
[01:29.40]Video of the landing provided by SpaceX
[01:33.96]showed the booster rocket being captured
[01:37.16]by the structure exactly as planned.
[01:40.80]A short time later, Starship's second stage
[01:45.56]safely spashed down in the Indian Ocean.
[01:49.84]The test flight and successful landings
[01:53.60]demonstrated progress for SpaceX's Starship system.
[01:59.60]The American space agency NASA
[02:03.28]is planning to use Starship
[02:05.96]to carry the next U.S. astronauts to the moon.
[02:10.60]Such a landing would be the first
[02:13.44]since NASA's Apollo 17 mission in 1972.
[02:19.44]The next planned moon landing
[02:22.88]– which NASA officials have set for September 2026
[02:28.96]– is part of NASA's Artemis program.
[02:32.24]Artemis will also seek to establish
[02:35.68]a permanent base around the moon
[02:38.96]to support ongoing lunar visits
[02:42.04]and possible future trips to Mars.
[02:45.60]SpaceX was chosen
[02:48.24]to lead NASA's planned moon landing
[02:51.28]after numerous successful demonstrations
[02:54.80]and missions in recent years.
[02:57.96]The company's rockets and spacecraft
[03:01.64]have been dependably transporting
[03:04.16]astronauts and materials
[03:06.28]to the International Space Station (ISS) since 2020.
[03:12.64]NASA also chose American aerospace company Boeing
[03:18.20]to serve as a possible partner in its Artemis program.
[03:22.72]But the company's Starliner rocket has faced major delays
[03:28.36]and difficulties during past test flights.
[03:32.96]In the last one, Starliner successfully
[03:36.76]transported two American astronauts
[03:40.28]– Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams
[03:43.32]– to the ISS in early June.
[03:46.68]The two were expected to stay in space for only a week.
[03:51.92]But ongoing technical issues
[03:54.92]with the Starliner spacecraft
[03:57.60]prevented a return trip.
[04:00.52]NASA recently decided
[04:03.60]to have Starliner return to Earth
[04:06.52]without the astronauts.
[04:09.12]The plan is for Wilmore and Williams
[04:12.56]to return home from the ISS in February
[04:17.00]on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.
[04:20.88]Before SpaceX's latest mission,
[04:24.36]several Starship rockets exploded
[04:27.88]during the test flights.
[04:30.20]The last non-exploding test happened in June.
[04:35.00]During that flight, SpaceX
[04:37.56]reported some damage to heat-resisting tiles
[04:41.88]on the outside of Starship.
[04:44.04]But improvements made since then
[04:47.48]appeared to have succeeded.
[04:50.16]After Sunday's flight, SpaceX chief Elon Musk
[04:55.60]said the rockets appeared to be generally
[04:59.12]in good condition, with just minor warping
[05:02.92]of some outer engine parts from intense heat.
[05:07.20]He noted that those parts could be fixed easily.
[05:12.12]Musk is also chief of the social media service X.
[05:17.76]On the service, he expressed excitement
[05:21.48]when the Starship booster rocket
[05:23.92]returned to the launch area
[05:26.68]and was "caught" by the structure.
[05:29.28]SpaceX calls the huge metal arms
[05:33.44]that capture and secure the booster rocket
[05:36.60]on land "chopsticks"
[05:39.12]because they move similarly to the eating instruments.
[05:43.72]"The tower has caught the rocket!!"
[05:46.60]Musk wrote in a message on X.
[05:49.88]"Big step towards making life multiplanetary
[05:54.44]was made today," he added.
[05:57.36]The successful test flight was also praised
[06:01.04]on X by NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.
[06:06.20]"Congratulations to @SpaceX
[06:09.48]on its successful booster catch
[06:12.48]and fifth Starship flight test today!" Nelson wrote.
[06:17.76]He added that "continued testing"
[06:20.88]will prepare NASA and its partners
[06:24.04]for a series of "bold missions" to come in the future.
