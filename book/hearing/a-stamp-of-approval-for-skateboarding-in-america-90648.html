。
[00:00.04]For many years,
[00:02.12]skateboarding was considered an activity
[00:05.60]for young rebels or drug users
[00:09.12]in city streets, schoolgrounds
[00:12.12]and public parks.
[00:14.24]Those days are long gone.
[00:17.48]Skateboarding, which has Indigenous roots
[00:21.00]connected to surfing,
[00:23.08]is now an Olympic sport.
[00:26.40]There are many skateboarding competitions
[00:29.04]held across the United States
[00:31.60]and other countries.
[00:34.56]Recently, skateboarding was honored
[00:37.44]with a special recognition: a postage stamp.
[00:42.44]The U.S. Postal Service
[00:44.64]released the stamps
[00:46.40]at a skate park in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:51.00]Four Indigneous artist-skateboarders
[00:54.68]created the skateboards
[00:56.48]pictured on the postage.
[00:59.52]William Zollars,
[01:00.96]a member of the USPS Board of Governors,
[01:04.72]officiated at the event.
[01:07.36]"As an American institution
[01:10.36]older than our country itself,
[01:13.56]the Postal Service
[01:15.32]is always looking for ways to highlight
[01:18.32]and honor the stories and histories
[01:21.72]that are unique to the United States,"
[01:25.04]Zollars said.
[01:26.60]"We are honored to do that again
[01:29.96]through these ‘Art of the Skateboard'
[01:32.68]Forever stamps."
[01:35.36]Di'Orr Greenwood is one of the artists.
[01:38.52]The 27-year-old was born and raised
[01:42.92]on the Navajo Nation in Arizona.
[01:46.84]She said as a child
[01:49.04]she was always getting pushed out of areas
[01:52.60]where she would skate.
[01:54.52]She noted the sport has come a long way.
[01:59.40]"Now it's like being accepted
[02:01.92]on a global scale," Greenwood said.
[02:05.08]"There's so many skateboarders I know
[02:08.40]that are extremely proud of it."
[02:11.92]The new stamps calls attention
[02:14.68]to the popularity of skateboarding,
[02:17.36]especially in Indian Country
[02:20.36]where the demand for skate parks is growing.
[02:24.84]The artists see the stamp
[02:27.16]as a useable art piece
[02:29.32]that will be seen across the United States
[02:33.08]and around the world.
[02:35.88]For her skateboard stamp,
[02:38.00]artist Crystal Worl
[02:40.16]honored her clan
[02:41.80]and her love of the water.
[02:45.24]A Sockeye salmon fish
[02:47.28]is represented
[02:48.80]against a blue and indigo background.
[02:53.12]"There are certain designs,
[02:55.12]patterns and stories
[02:57.08]that belong to certain clans
[02:59.80]and you have to have permission
[03:02.48]even as an Indigenous person
[03:05.16]to share certain stories or designs," Worl said.
[03:10.60]The other artists who created stamps
[03:13.52]are William James Taylor Jr.,
[03:16.28]an artist from Virginia,
[03:18.64]and Federico "MasPaz" Frum,
[03:22.40]a Colombian-born muralist
[03:25.16]in Washington, D.C.
[03:28.40]The USPS will print 18 million of the stamps.
[03:33.52]For the artists, being part of a project
[03:37.16]that feels low-tech
[03:39.32]in this age of social media is energizing.
[03:44.80]"Maybe I'll get a letter in the mail
[03:47.40]that someone sent me with my stamp on it,"
[03:50.88]said the 35-year-old Worl,
[03:53.68]who lives in Juneau, Alaska.
[03:56.76]"I think that's when it will really hit home
[04:00.20]with the excitement of that."
