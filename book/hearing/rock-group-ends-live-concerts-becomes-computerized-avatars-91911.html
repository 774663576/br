。
[00:00.04]Recently, members of the American rock band Kiss
[00:06.16]closed out their final performance.
[00:10.24]The group's "The End of the Road" concert series
[00:14.64]ended in New York City's famous Madison Square Garden.
[00:21.28]But as it turns out, fans will still be able
[00:25.96]to enjoy Kiss performances for years to come.
[00:31.92]The band formed in 1973.
[00:36.76]It is currently made up of founders Paul Stanley
[00:41.36]and Gene Simmons, as well as Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer.
[00:48.84]Towards the end of Saturday's show,
[00:52.04]the band members left the stage
[00:55.28]and revealed computerized likenesses of themselves.
[01:01.52]The computerized avatars launched into a performance
[01:06.84]of the song "God Gave Rock and Roll to You."
[01:12.16]After 50 years of Kiss, the band now hopes
[01:16.52]to be remembered forever.
[01:20.08]The avatars were created by George Lucas'
[01:24.48]special-effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic.
[01:30.40]The company also worked
[01:32.16]with Pophouse Entertainment Group.
[01:36.44]Bjorn Ulvaeus, a member of
[01:39.40]the Swedish musical group ABBA, is its founder.
[01:45.04]The two companies recently came together
[01:48.52]for the "ABBA Voyage" show in London.
[01:53.44]Fans there could enjoy a full concert by the Swedish band
[01:58.64]as performed by the computerized avatars.
[02:03.68]Per Sundin is chief executive officer
[02:07.96]of Pophouse Entertainment.
[02:11.52]He said the new technology
[02:14.04]lets Kiss continue its history for "eternity."
[02:19.44]He said the band was not on stage
[02:22.32]during the computerized performance.
[02:26.36]He added, "Kiss could have a concert in three cities
[02:31.04]in the same night across three different continents.
[02:35.72]That's what you could do with this."
[02:39.32]In order to create their computerized avatars,
[02:43.56]Kiss performed in equipment
[02:45.92]that followed their movement.
[02:49.12]This equipment is called motion capture suits.
[02:54.28]Experimentation with this kind of technology
[02:58.64]has become increasingly common in the music industry.
[03:04.44]In October, K-pop star Mark Tuan
[03:08.28]partnered with Soul Machines
[03:11.08]to create a computerized version of himself
[03:14.72]called "Digital Mark."
[03:17.68]The technology lets fans
[03:19.88]have one-on-one talks with Digital Mark.
[03:25.08]Tuan is the first famous person
[03:28.32]to attach their likeness to OpenAI's
[03:32.20]GPT artificial intelligence technology.
[03:37.68]Aespa is a K-pop girl group.
[03:40.92]The group often performs
[03:43.16]alongside their computerized avatars.
[03:47.76]In fact, the four-member band
[03:50.60]is meant to be seen as a group of eight.
[03:55.08]Another girl group, Eternity,
[03:57.88]is made up entirely of computerized performers.
[04:03.00]No humans are necessary.
[04:06.44]Kiss performer Paul Stanley told reporters
[04:10.64]that what they have done "... has been amazing,
[04:14.36]but it's not enough. The band deserves to live on
[04:19.12]because the band is bigger than we are."
[04:23.24]"We can be forever young and forever iconic
[04:27.28]by taking us to places we've never dreamed of before,"
[04:31.92]Kiss performer Gene Simmons added.
[04:36.00]"The technology is going to make Paul jump higher
[04:39.84]than he's ever done before."
