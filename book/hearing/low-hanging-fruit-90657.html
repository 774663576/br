<p>Have you ever gone to a farm or an <strong>orchard</strong> to <strong>pick</strong> fruit? Was all of the fruit easy to pick, or were some pieces easier to reach than others?

<p>If you are the first person to arrive at an apple tree during harvest time, you can easily find some <u>low-hanging fruit</u>. These are the apples that are on the <strong>branches</strong> closest to the ground. <u>Low-hanging fruit</u> describes the most <strong>obvious</strong> or easiest things to do to help you reach a goal.</p>
<p>The problem with <u>low-hanging fruit</u> is that it is easy for others to get there first, too.</p>
<p>People who try to create new music, TV shows, or movies sometimes face this problem. They might believe that the best <strong>melodies</strong> and story ideas have already been taken.</p>
<p>Some songwriters or scriptwriters might say that the creative <u>low-hanging fruit </u>has already been picked.</p>
<p>When most of the fruit, ideas, or things that we desire have already been taken, we can say that the remains are <u>slim pickings</u>. This means there are only a few useful things left to choose from.</p>
<p>And, when almost nothing of value remains, we are <u>scraping the bottom of the barrel</u>. That means we are trying to get the last little bits. There is <u>nothing but scraps</u> left.</p>
<p>"Scraps" are small, unwanted pieces that remain at the end of a process, like bits of food remaining after making or eating a meal. The scraps are often given to animals or thrown away. So, if you have <u>nothing but scraps</u>, it means you have the least valuable things, worth almost nothing to most people.</p>
<p>When there is nothing left of something we need, like water, we must solve the problem. One answer is to dig a well to reach water underground. Some wells can last for many years, but others <u>run dry</u>. When <u>the well has run dry</u>, there is nothing left.</p>
<p>Paul Simon is a famous American songwriter. In 2007, he told a reporter, "I think there's a certain reservoir of melody that you are born with, and in the beginning, you <strong>draw on</strong> that. And then after a while, a relatively short while, you use it up."</p>
<p>A reservoir is a place where water is stored, such as a pool, a <strong>pond</strong>, or a lake. Simon added that when the artist has used all that is in the reservoir, he or she needs to expand their skills. Otherwise, their creative <u>well is going to run dry</u>.</p>
<p>So far, we have talked about running out of ideas. But what happens if you get lucky and find a lot of something valuable, like oil or gold?</p>

[00:06.16]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:10.92]from VOA Learning English.
[00:14.08]Have you ever gone to a farm
[00:23.16]or an orchard to pick fruit?
[00:27.20]Was all of the fruit easy to pick,
[00:30.92]or were some pieces easier to reach than others?
[00:36.52]Perhaps there were some apples in a tree
[00:39.92]that were too high for you to reach.
[00:44.12]And maybe you saw that others had picked
[00:48.32]the easiest fruit to reach before you.
[00:52.88]Today's Words and Their Stories, however,
[00:56.12]is not about fruit, but about ideas.
[01:01.20]If you are the first person to arrive
[01:04.76]at an apple tree during harvest time,
[01:08.28]you can easily find some low-hanging fruit.
[01:13.00]These are the apples that are on the branches
[01:16.28]closest to the ground.
[01:19.32]Low-hanging fruit describes the most obvious
[01:23.24]or easiest things to do to help you reach a goal.
[01:29.40]The problem with low-hanging fruit
[01:32.72]is that it is easy for others to get there first, too.
[01:39.56]People who try to create new music,
[01:42.68]TV shows, or movies
[01:45.88]sometimes face this problem.
[01:49.68]They might believe that the best melodies
[01:53.00]and story ideas have already been taken.
[01:58.56]Some songwriters or scriptwriters
[02:01.88]might say that the creative low-hanging fruit
[02:06.32]has already been picked.
[02:09.52]When most of the fruit, ideas,
[02:12.96]or things that we desire have already been taken,
[02:17.88]we can say that the remains are slim pickings.
[02:24.32]This means there are only a few
[02:27.52]useful things left to choose from.
[02:31.56]And, when almost nothing of value remains,
[02:36.80]we are scraping the bottom of the barrel.
[02:41.56]That means we are trying to get the last little bits.
[02:47.12]There is nothing but scraps left.
[02:50.64]"Scraps" are small, unwanted pieces
[02:54.64]that remain at the end of a process,
[02:57.64]like bits of food remaining after making
[03:01.72]or eating a meal.
[03:04.96]The scraps are often
[03:06.52]given to animals or thrown away.
[03:10.40]So, if you have nothing but scraps,
[03:14.24]it means you have the least valuable things,
[03:18.44]worth almost nothing to most people.
[03:23.92]When there is nothing left of something we need,
[03:28.16]like water, we must solve the problem.
[03:33.92]One answer is to dig a well
[03:36.92]to reach water underground.
[03:40.56]Some wells can last for many years,
[03:43.88]but others run dry.
[03:48.08]When the well has run dry,
[03:50.84]there is nothing left.
[03:54.76]Paul Simon is a famous American songwriter.
[04:00.16]In 2007, he told a reporter,
[04:04.88]"I think there's a certain reservoir of melody
[04:09.00]that you are born with,
[04:10.92]and in the beginning, you draw on that.
[04:14.64]And then after a while,
[04:17.56]a relatively short while, you use it up."
[04:22.28]A reservoir is a place where water is stored,
[04:27.12]such as a pool, a pond, or a lake.
[04:33.00]Simon added that
[04:35.16]when the artist has used all that is in the reservoir,
[04:39.56]he or she needs to expand their skills.
[04:45.20]Otherwise, their creative well
[04:48.32]is going to run dry.
[04:51.64]So far, we have talked about running out of ideas.
[04:57.44]But what happens if you get lucky
[05:00.52]and find a lot of something valuable,
[05:04.20]like oil or gold?
[05:08.16]In those cases, you have hit the mother lode.
[05:14.12]The term mother lode came from California
[05:17.76]after gold was discovered there in 1848.
[05:23.88]It describes a narrow area of rock in the state
[05:28.08]about 190 kilometers in length.
[05:33.32]This rock was the source, or "mother,"
[05:37.84]of the gold found in rivers
[05:40.48]and streams in the area.
[05:44.44]Is VOA Learning English
[05:46.76]your mother lode for learning
[05:49.28]new idioms and expressions?
[05:51.68]Let us know in the comments below.
[05:56.40]And be sure to keep reading
