。
[00:00.04]The economic effects of the coronavirus could push around half a billion people into poverty, Oxfam said this week.
[00:10.48]The report was released by the Nairobi-based charity
[00:14.52]ahead of next week's International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank yearly meeting.
[00:21.48]"The economic crisis...is deeper than the 2008 global financial crisis," the report said.
[00:29.92]"The estimates show that... global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990," it said,
[00:38.60]adding that some countries could return to poverty levels last seen thirty years ago.
[00:46.64]The report examined several possible economic outcomes based on the World Bank's measure of poverty.
[00:55.84]People under extreme poverty live on $1.90 a day or less.
[01:03.16]And those at a lesser poverty level live on less than $5.50 a day.
[01:11.04]The most serious outcome would be a 20 percent decrease in earnings.
[01:17.24]It would cause 1.2 billion people to live in extreme poverty worldwide.
[01:25.12]It would also raise the number of people living in poverty to nearly 4 billion.
[01:32.16]Women are at more risk than men because they are more likely to work in jobs that have little or no protection.
[01:41.80]Poor people cannot take time off from work or buy food in large amounts, the report warned.
[01:49.56]It also said more than 2 billion people did not get earnings while they are sick.
[01:57.08]To lessen the effects on poverty, Oxfam suggested a plan that would give money to people and businesses in need.
[02:07.12]It also called for debt cancellation, more IMF support and increased aid to poor countries.
[02:16.92]Oxfam added that additional taxes on wealth, high profits
[02:21.64]and some financial tools favored by the wealthy would help raise the money needed.
[02:28.76]Calls for debt cancellation have increased recently as the COVID-19 pandemic
[02:35.16]has affected the economy of developing countries around the world.
[02:41.32]Wealthier countries around the world would need to give at least $2.5 trillion to help developing nations, the report said,
[02:51.44]adding that wealthier countries have shown they can raise that amount to help their own economies.
[02:59.48]The United States, for example, recently released a $2.2 trillion spending plan to rescue the country's economy.
[03:09.92]China, Japan and some European nations have also passed their own spending measures.
[03:18.44]The report said, "Unless developing countries are also able to fight... the crisis will continue
[03:26.04]and it will inflict even greater harm on all countries, rich and poor."
