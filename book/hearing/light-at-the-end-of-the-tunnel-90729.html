<p>And that gives us this expression – <u>light at the end of the tunnel.</u></p>
<p>This means to have hope that a bad situation will soon come to an end.</p>
<p>Imagine you are traveling through a long, dark tunnel. You keep going and going but you only see darkness. Then, finally, you see light up ahead! The end of the tunnel is near!</p>
<p>We use this expression for any difficult situation or long process. Let's say you are working on a long difficult project. It feels like you will never finish.

<p>As an expression, to have <u>tunnel vision</u> means you are narrow-minded. You have a small or narrow viewpoint on a certain subject. It can also mean that you are single-minded, meaning you are only able to think of one thing.</p>
<p><u>Tunnel vision</u> is usually not considered a good thing. But sometimes having <u>tunnel vision</u> temporarily helps you to finish something. Used this way, <u>tunnel vision</u> means to be extremely <strong>focused</strong> on something or on a part of something while ignoring other things. So, again, that can be helpful.</p>
<p>When talking about people who have <u>tunnel vision</u>, we can also say they <u>have blinders on</u>. They are not willing to see certain things. As with <u>tunnel vision</u>, <u>having blinders on</u> can also help you finish something difficult or meet a goal.</p>
<p>"Tunnel" can also be used a verb. It means to dig or <strong>bore</strong> through something. It is quite an act to tunnel through a mountain when making a tunnel. But you can also dig through things like work. If I tunnel through a pile of documents, it means I was buried in work but worked my way out.</p>

。
[00:07.64]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.48]from VOA Learning English.
[00:14.56]Tunnels are long passageways
[00:22.24]that help us get from one point to another.
[00:26.96]We drive through tunnels.
[00:29.16]Subways and trains travel through tunnels.
[00:32.96]We can walk through tunnels
[00:35.60]and be protected from bad weather.
[00:39.64]Some tunnels are very long.
[00:42.48]When we drive through them,
[00:45.00]we must turn on our headlights.
[00:47.72]If not, we cannot see!
[00:51.92]If you are afraid of long dark tunnels,
[00:55.36]having lights is important.
[00:59.40]And that gives us this expression –
[01:02.48]light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:07.04]This means to have hope
[01:09.12]that a bad situation
[01:11.40]will soon come to an end.
[01:14.80]Imagine you are traveling through a long, dark tunnel.
[01:19.84]You keep going and going
[01:22.52]but you only see darkness.
[01:26.32]Then, finally,
[01:28.04]you see light up ahead!
[01:31.16]The end of the tunnel is near!
[01:34.24]We use this expression
[01:37.12]for any difficult situation
[01:39.28]or long process.
[01:42.72]Let's say you are working on a long difficult project.
[01:47.04]It feels like you will never finish.
[01:51.04]But then, after a long day of working
[01:55.20]you finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[02:00.28]There is hope that the project will finally be finished.
[02:05.56]Our other tunnel expression for today
[02:08.48]is not as hopeful.
[02:11.76]Tunnel vision is an actual condition
[02:15.16]where your field of vision is limited.
[02:19.20]You have a narrow field of vision
[02:21.64]resulting in loss of side vision.
[02:26.04]That is the medical condition.
[02:29.32]As an expression,
[02:31.56]to have tunnel vision means you are narrow-minded.
[02:36.84]You have a small
[02:38.36]or narrow viewpoint on a certain subject.
[02:43.12]It can also mean that you are single-minded,
[02:46.92]meaning you are only able to think of one thing.
[02:53.00]Tunnel vision is usually not considered a good thing.
[02:58.48]But sometimes
[03:00.32]having tunnel vision temporarily
[03:03.08]helps you to finish something.
[03:06.80]Used this way, tunnel vision
[03:09.68]means to be extremely focused on something
[03:13.48]or on a part of something
[03:16.60]while ignoring other things.
[03:19.92]So, again, that can be helpful.
[03:24.52]When talking about people who have tunnel vision,
[03:28.08]we can also say they have blinders on.
[03:31.72]They are not willing to see certain things.
[03:36.84]As with tunnel vision,
[03:38.84]having blinders on can also help you
[03:42.24]finish something difficult or meet a goal.
[03:47.52]"Tunnel" can also be used a verb.
[03:51.00]It means to dig or bore through something.
[03:56.36]It is quite an act
[03:58.12]to tunnel through a mountain
[04:00.16]when making a tunnel.
[04:02.92]But you can also dig through things like work.
[04:06.84]If I tunnel through a pile of documents,
[04:10.56]it means I was buried in work
[04:13.60]but worked my way out.
[04:16.48]And that's all the time we have
[04:19.56]for this Words and Their Stories.
[04:22.04]Until next time.
[04:23.68]I'm Anna Matteo.
