<p>Scientists are<strong> focusing</strong> on certain organs. They are mapping the jobs of cells in the mouth, stomach and intestines.

。
[00:00.04]Researchers have created an early version
[00:04.16]of a map of some of the human body's cells.
[00:09.48]The human body has an estimated
[00:12.12]37.2 trillion cells.
[00:17.08]Each type of cell has a unique job.
[00:21.80]Knowing each cell's job can help scientists
[00:25.32]better understand health
[00:27.68]and diseases such as cancer.
[00:31.84]The work is part of the Human Cell Atlas project.
[00:37.56]The effort began in 2016.
[00:40.64]It involves researchers around the world.
[00:45.20]The group, called a consortium,
[00:48.48]plans to release a more complete atlas
[00:51.76]in 2026 by mapping cells
[00:55.52]from 18 organs and body systems.
[00:59.60]These include the skin, heart, and breasts.
[01:05.76]Some of the researchers published their findings
[01:09.12]on bone development in embryos.
[01:12.32]The study appeared in Nature
[01:15.28]on November 20.
[01:18.44]Aviv Regev is a founding co-chair of the project.
[01:24.56]Regev is currently executive vice president
[01:28.00]and head of research and early development
[01:32.04]at U.S. biotech company Genentech.
[01:36.44]She said the work is important in two ways.
[01:41.60]First, the project relates to curiosity.
[01:46.20]Humans have long wanted to know
[01:48.64]what they are made of.
[01:50.48]"And, in fact, biologists
[01:53.28]have been mapping cells
[01:55.24]since the 1600s
[01:57.24]for that reason," Regev added.
[02:01.32]Second, Regev said knowing how cells work
[02:05.56]is critical for understanding
[02:08.20]how to treat disease.
[02:11.28]"Cells are the basic unit of life,
[02:14.32]and when things go wrong,
[02:16.52]they go wrong with our cells,
[02:18.68]first and foremost," she added.
[02:23.40]"Fundamentally,
[02:24.72]these studies tell us how tissues,
[02:27.36]organs and humans are built,"
[02:30.72]said Muzlifah Haniffa
[02:33.32]of Wellcome Sanger Institute
[02:35.64]and Newcastle University in Britain.
[02:40.44]Haniffa was a member of the project's
[02:43.08]organizing committee.
[02:46.88]Scientists are focusing on certain organs.
[02:50.88]They are mapping the jobs of cells
[02:53.80]in the mouth, stomach and intestines.
[02:58.04]They are researching cells that guide
[03:01.48]how bones and joints develop.
[03:05.52]They also are exploring which cells
[03:08.92]group into tissue,
[03:11.20]where they are found in the body
[03:13.52]and how they change over time.
[03:17.72]The high-resolution,
[03:19.44]open-access atlas
[03:21.76]is considered a first version.
[03:25.52]The scientists say
[03:27.44]they hope it will help researchers
[03:30.00]fight diseases that damage human cells.
[03:34.80]The current cell map not only shows
[03:37.48]many types of human cells.
[03:39.84]It also shows the relationships
[03:42.44]between cells, said Dr. Timothy Chan.
[03:47.32]Chan is a cancer expert
[03:49.72]at the Cleveland Clinic
[03:51.44]who was not involved in the project.
[03:54.48]Chan said the atlas project
[03:57.00]is a "deep dive into human biology"
[04:01.04]that is sure to help identify
[04:04.12]and treat cancer cells.
[04:07.72]Scientists are also creating other atlases
[04:12.04]that could show more about
[04:14.12]the foundations of health and disease
[04:17.28]in specific parts of the body.
[04:21.12]For example, researchers working on a brain atlas
[04:25.84]are seeking to understand the structure,
[04:28.96]location and function of the many types of brain cells.
[04:35.32]A new gut microbiome atlas
[04:38.32]is meant to show the collection
[04:40.76]of microorganisms in the intestines.
[04:45.32]Those organs play important parts
[04:48.04]in digestion and immune system health.
