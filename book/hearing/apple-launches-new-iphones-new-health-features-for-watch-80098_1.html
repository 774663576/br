<p>The event was held inside the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California.这次发布会在加州库比蒂诺苹果公司总部的乔布斯剧院内举行。</p>
<p>One of the new phones is a larger version of the company's pricey iPhone X, which launched last fall. The new model is called iPhone Xs Max. It has a screen size of 16.5 centimeters, making it Apple's biggest smartphone yet.<br/>其中一款新手机是该公司去年秋天推出的天价iPhone X的大号版，这款新型号手机被称之为 iPhone Xs Max。它的屏幕尺寸达到16.5厘米，成为了苹果最大的智能手机。</p>
<p>As with the iPhone X, the Xs Max has a screen that runs from edge to edge to provide more viewing space. The phone's screen also needs no backlight, so black and other colors are supposed to appear truer than on previous devices.<br/>与iphone X一样，Xs Max 拥有全面屏，可以提供更大可视面积。这款手机的屏幕也不需要背光，所以黑色和其它颜色应该会比以前的设备显示得更加真实。</p>
<p>The iPhone Xs Max will cost $1099, up from the $999 price of the iPhone X.<br/>这款 iPhone Xs Max售价为1099美元，高于 iPhone X 的999美元。</p>
<p>Another new model, called iPhone Xs, is smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus, but actually has a larger, 14.7 centimeters, viewable display.<br/>另一款名为 iPhone Xs的新型号比 iPhone 8 Plus 尺寸要小，但是实际上拥有一个更大的达到14.7厘米的屏幕。</p>
<p>The company says both the Xs and Xs Max models are equipped with an improved version of Face ID, which first launched with the iPhone X. Face ID permits users to unlock their devices just by looking at them. The iPhone Xs is priced at $999.<br/>该公司表示，Xs 和 Xs Max型号都装备了升级版的面部识别，该功能最初跟 iPhone X一起推出。面部识别功能允许用户只需要看一眼设备就能解锁。 iPhone Xs手机售价为999美元，</p>
<p>Apple says the Xs and Xs Max versions include the "most powerful chip" found in any smartphone.<br/>苹果公司表示，Xs 和 Xs Max 包含了智能手机中最强大的芯片。</p>
<p>In addition, the devices use a "dual-camera system" the company says produces much-improved picture quality. This system combines faster processing speeds with what Apple describes as a "neural engine." With these tools working together, the camera can automatically improve things like lighting, sharpness and depth of field, Apple says.<br/>此外，该设备采用了苹果公司声称可以大幅提升图像质量的“双摄像头系统”。该系统将更快的处理速度与苹果公司所谓的“神经引擎”相结合。苹果公司表示，通过这些工具的协同工作，相机可以自动改善光线、清晰度以及景深等。</p>
<p>The third newly launched device is called iPhone XR. Made of aluminum, it has an edge to edge LCD display measuring 15.5 centimeters. The iPhone XR comes equipped with Face ID, but only a single lens camera. It is designed with fewer features than the other models to cut costs. The iPhone XR sells for $749.<br/>新推出的第三款手机被称之为 iPhone XR。它由铝制成，采用了尺寸为15.5厘米的LCD全面屏。iPhone XR配备了面部识别功能，但是只有一个摄像头。它旨在以相对于其它版本更少的功能来降低成本。iPhone XR售价为749美元。</p>
<p>The new iPhone models will be available in the coming weeks in the United States and many other parts of the world.<br/>这些新款手机未来几周将在美国和世界各地很多地区上市销售。</p>
<p><strong>Apple Watch<br/>苹果手表</strong></p>
<p>At its launch event, Apple also announced new versions and expanded features of its Apple Watch devices. The new Apple Watch Series 4 will be a bit larger than current models, coming in 40 millimeter and 44 millimeter versions. Apple says this will provide a screen that is about 30 percent larger than the Series 3 models. The Series 4 will also be built with a stronger back made of ceramic.<br/>在发布会上，苹果公司还发布了新版的苹果手表并扩展了其功能。新推出的苹果手表4系列将比目前的型号略大，有40毫米和44毫米两种版本。苹果公司称这使得它比3系列的屏幕大30%。4系列的表盖还将采用更为坚固的陶瓷制成。</p>
<p>Some of the Apple Watch's most popular features deal with tools to help users improve their health and fitness. Several improvements were announced related to these features. For example, the Series 4 will be able to detect when someone has an irregular heartbeat and send a warning message to the user.<br/>苹果手表的一些最受欢迎的功能涉及到帮助用户改善健康和体型的工具。发布会上宣布了几项与此相关的改进。例如，4系列苹果手表能够检测出心律不齐并向用户发出警告。</p>
<p>Apple said the devices can also gather more detailed heart health information known as an electrocardiogram. The watches also have a feature that is supposed to detect when a person falls. Apple says the watch can even automatically make a 911 emergency call for help if the person does not begin moving within a minute.<br/>苹果公司表示，这些设备还能收集更为详细的心脏健康信息，也就是所谓的心电图。这些手表还有一个功能，可以检测出人摔倒。苹果公司称，如果此人在一分钟内没有开始移动，苹果手表甚至可以自动拨打911紧急求助电话。</p>
<p><strong>Dual SIM card<br/>双SIM卡</strong></p>
<p>Apple also used the launch event to announce that its new iPhone X devices will be equipped with dual SIM card technology. This means the devices will be able to hold both a nano-SIM and eSIM inside.<br/>苹果公司在发布会上还宣布其新款苹果X设备将装备双SIM技术，这意味着这些设备内部可以同时容纳一张 nano-SIM卡以及一张eSIM卡。</p>
<p>An eSim can be controlled virtually and does not have to be placed physically inside the phone. This dual SIM technology can permit users to use two phone lines with their device. It will also make it easier for users to change phone service carriers without having to get new SIM cards directly from company providers.<br/>eSim卡可以虚拟控制，无需在手机内部放置实体卡片。这种双SIM卡技术使得用户可以在他们的设备上使用两条电话线路。它还可以让用户更轻松地更换电话服务运营商，而无需直接从运营商获取新的SIM卡。</p>
<p>Apple announced that new phones launched in China will be equipped with spaces for two physical SIM cards, since eSim technology has not fully developed there.<br/>苹果公司宣布在中国推出的新手机将提供两张实体SIM卡的空间，因为eSim卡技术在中国尚未全面应用。</p>
<p>The technology had already been available on some of Apple's iPad and Apple Watch devices. Apple CEO Cook said the company is already working with phone carriers on how the new technology will be used.<br/>这项技术早已经在苹果的一些平板和手表设备上提供。苹果公司首席执行官库克表示，该公司已经同电话运营商合作研究如何使用这项新技术。</p>

。
[00:00.00]Apple announced three new iPhones and improved health features
[00:06.19]for its watches during a launch event on Wednesday.
[00:11.83]The event was held inside the Steve Jobs Theater
[00:17.16]at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California.
[00:22.59]One of the new phones is a larger version of the company's
[00:28.73]pricey iPhone X, which launched last fall.
[00:34.37]The new model is called iPhone Xs Max.
[00:39.75]It has a screen size of 16.5 centimeters,
[00:45.34]making it Apple's biggest smartphone yet.
[00:50.41]As with the iPhone X, the Xs Max has a screen
[00:57.12]that runs from edge to edge to provide more viewing space.
[01:02.72]The phone's screen also needs no backlight,
[01:06.89]so black and other colors are supposed to appear truer than on previous devices.
[01:14.26]The iPhone Xs Max will cost $1099, up from the $999 price of the iPhone X.
[01:27.69]Another new model, called iPhone Xs, is smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus,
[01:36.31]but actually has a larger, 14.7 centimeters, viewable display.
[01:44.12]The company says both the Xs and Xs Max models
[01:50.83]are equipped with an improved version of Face ID,
[01:55.40]which first launched with the iPhone X.
[01:59.61]Face ID permits users to unlock their devices just by looking at them.
[02:07.05]The iPhone Xs is priced at $999.
[02:13.87]Apple says the Xs and Xs Max versions
[02:19.44]include the "most powerful chip" found in any smartphone.
[02:24.92]In addition, the devices use a "dual-camera system" the company
[02:31.45]says produces much-improved picture quality.
[02:36.13]This system combines faster processing speeds
[02:40.26]with what Apple describes as a "neural engine."
[02:44.96]With these tools working together,
[02:47.86]the camera can automatically improve things like lighting,
[02:52.32]sharpness and depth of field, Apple says.
[02:57.42]The third newly launched device is called iPhone XR.
[03:04.94]Made of aluminum, it has an edge to edge LCD display measuring 15.5 centimeters.
[03:14.40]The iPhone XR comes equipped with Face ID, but only a single lens camera.
[03:22.47]It is designed with fewer features than the other models to cut costs.
[03:28.66]The iPhone XR sells for $749.
[03:35.51]The new iPhone models will be available in the coming weeks
[03:40.29]in the United States and many other parts of the world.
[03:44.44]At its launch event, Apple also announced new versions
[03:50.21]and expanded features of its Apple Watch devices.
[03:55.46]The new Apple Watch Series 4 will be a bit larger than current models,
[04:01.99]coming in 40 millimeter and 44 millimeter versions.
[04:07.58]Apple says this will provide a screen
[04:11.32]that is about 30 percent larger than the Series 3 models.
[04:16.49]The Series 4 will also be built with a stronger back made of ceramic.
[04:23.00]Some of the Apple Watch's most popular features
[04:28.01]deal with tools to help users improve their health and fitness.
[04:33.29]Several improvements were announced related to these features.
[04:38.67]For example, the Series 4 will be able to detect
[04:43.48]when someone has an irregular heartbeat and send a warning message to the user.
[04:50.63]Apple said the devices can also gather more detailed
[04:55.73]heart health information known as an electrocardiogram.
[05:01.50]The watches also have a feature that is supposed to detect when a person falls.
[05:07.87]Apple says the watch can even automatically make a 911 emergency call
[05:14.88]for help if the person does not begin moving within a minute.
[05:20.86]Apple also used the launch event to announce
[05:25.35]that its new iPhone X devices will be equipped with dual SIM card technology.
[05:33.11]This means the devices will be able to hold both a nano-SIM and eSIM inside.
[05:41.49]An eSim can be controlled virtually
[05:45.02]and does not have to be placed physically inside the phone.
[05:50.09]This dual SIM technology can permit users to use two phone lines with their device.
[05:58.03]It will also make it easier for users to change phone service carriers
[06:04.04]without having to get new SIM cards directly from company providers.
[06:10.20]Apple announced that new phones launched in China
[06:14.59]will be equipped with spaces for two physical SIM cards,
[06:19.40]since eSim technology has not fully developed there.
[06:24.52]The technology had already been available on some of Apple's iPad and Apple Watch devices.
[06:32.72]Apple CEO Cook said the company is already working
[06:37.08]with phone carriers on how the new technology will be used.
