。
[00:02.16]A federal study of all public schools
[00:05.96]says that America's Black and Latino students
[00:10.52]have reduced chances of success.
[00:15.80]The data came from the Civil Rights Data Collection,
[00:20.24]which is a survey by The U.S. Education Department.
[00:25.64]It aims to examine measures of educational opportunity.
[00:33.40]The Associated Press reported on some of the findings.
[00:40.00]The study said Black and Latino students
[00:43.72]were less likely to be in higher-level classes
[00:48.24]and to receive teaching from certified teachers.
[00:52.96]The findings suggested effects that have a lasting influence
[00:58.96]on students' ability to learn and finish college.
[01:04.92]The Education Department gathered data
[01:08.24]during the 2020-2021 school year.
[01:13.04]That year most public schools
[01:16.44]were at least partially closed,
[01:18.96]and teaching took place online
[01:22.20]because of COVID-19 restrictions.
[01:27.40]Speaking about the survey results,
[01:30.44]U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona
[01:34.64]said, "…access to educational opportunity
[01:38.48]in this country remains unequal."
[01:43.08]The U.S. Supreme Court declared segregation
[01:47.32]in public schools unlawful nearly 70 years ago.
[01:52.36]However, information in the federal survey
[01:56.72]said Black and Latino students were more likely
[02:01.08]to attend schools
[02:03.12]with lower percentages of certified teachers.
[02:08.80]The data also suggested that Black and Latino students
[02:13.52]are more likely to be in schools that have security guards
[02:18.52]or police officers but no counselor.
[02:22.08]Cardona called this "appalling," because of rising rates
[02:27.56]of mental health difficulties for young people.
[02:32.16]The new data also showed
[02:34.44]barriers to higher level, or advanced, classes.
[02:38.88]Taking advanced classes improves a student's
[02:43.08]chances of going to college, studies suggest.
[02:48.28]But Black and Latino students
[02:50.64]were far less likely to take such classes.
[02:55.72]Black students represented 15 percent
[02:59.48]of all high school students,
[03:01.88]but they made up just eight percent of students
[03:06.24]in Advanced Placement (AP) science
[03:10.32]and six percent in AP math.
[03:13.92]Latino students represented 27 percent
[03:18.48]of all high school students
[03:20.64]but made up 20 percent in AP science
[03:24.56]and 19 percent in AP math classes.
[03:30.40]Sonya Thomas is the executive director
[03:33.84]of Nashville PROPEL, an activist organization
[03:38.24]that works with minorities.
[03:41.40]She said children should have the best
[03:44.68]and the government should be accountable.
[03:47.88]"It's so disheartening," she added.
[03:52.72]Catherine E. Lhamon is Assistant Secretary
[03:56.56]for Civil Rights at the Department of Education.
[04:00.40]She called differences between students
[04:03.72]in the Civil Rights Data Collection information "troubling."
[04:09.04]The data showed that in 5,500 public high schools
[04:14.44]where Black and Latino students
[04:16.84]make up 75 percent of all students,
[04:20.52]there were not as many math, science
[04:23.72]and computer classes as at other schools.
[04:28.88]In 35 percent of schools
[04:31.72]with a high number of Black and Latino students,
[04:35.80]calculus was not offered.
[04:38.40]It was available at 54 percent of schools
[04:43.44]with low Black and Latino numbers.
[04:48.36]The Education Department
[04:50.44]found that students with disabilities
[04:53.16]and those learning English also faced problems.
[04:57.68]Fewer students in both groups took math
[05:01.52]and science classes compared to all students.
[05:07.44]The Civil Rights Data Collection is an effort
[05:11.08]by the U.S. Department of Education
[05:13.88]to gather information about American public schools.
[05:19.28]The department's website says the survey started in 1968.
[05:26.12]It started to include all public schools
[05:29.48]in the 2009-2010 school year
[05:33.32]and is required by the government agency.
