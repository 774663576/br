。
[00:00.04]Visitors will soon be able to see
[00:03.68]a long-hidden space inside the Medici Chapel
[00:08.20]in the Italian city of Florence.
[00:11.20]The walls of the small space contain drawings
[00:15.12]that some experts believe may have been created
[00:19.00]by the famous artist Michelangelo.
[00:22.96]The secret room is small – 10 meters by 3 meters.
[00:27.92]Officials discovered the room in 1975
[00:32.48]when searching for a way to make a new exit
[00:36.24]from Medici Chapel.
[00:38.20]The museum's then-director Paolo Dal Poggetto
[00:42.56]strongly believed that the drawings were by Michelangelo,
[00:46.64]said the current director, Paola D'Agostino.
[00:50.56]A debate over the issue began then
[00:54.00]and continues to this day.
[00:57.20]D'Agostino suggested
[00:58.84]that experts of Michelangelo's drawings
[01:02.24]did not believe he created the works
[01:04.96]at the time of their discovery 50 years ago.
[01:09.64]She added, "Others had a more moderate view,
[01:13.56]in the sense they thought
[01:15.08]that some could be by Michelangelo
[01:17.80]and others could be by followers.
[01:20.48]So the debate is ongoing."
[01:23.32]The room was used to store coal until 1955.
[01:28.76]Then it was closed and forgotten for years
[01:33.12]below a special kind of opening
[01:35.76]known as a trapdoor.
[01:38.00]The trapdoor was hidden beneath furniture.
[01:41.84]The drawings themselves were discovered
[01:44.84]under two layers of plaster
[01:47.44]– a substance used to make walls and ceilings smooth.
[01:53.04]Dal Poggetto believed Michelangelo hid in the space
[01:57.12]to escape the anger of Pope Clement VII.
[02:01.12]The artist had supported a short-lived republic
[02:05.20]that overthrew the Medicis.
[02:07.52]In the room, the artist drew for some of his projects.
[02:12.64]They include drawings believed
[02:14.92]to be the legs of Giuliano de' Medici.
[02:18.52]Starting on November 15,
[02:21.36]small groups of four people
[02:24.20]will be able to visit the room for about 15 minutes.
[02:28.96]Visitors will have to pay an additional $20
[02:33.32]on top of the $10 charged
[02:36.08]for entry to the main museum.
[02:38.96]The museum said it limits the number of visitors
[02:43.24]because of the need to reduce exposure
[02:46.24]of the artworks to light.
[02:48.48]At most, 100 visitors
[02:51.12]will be able to go to the room each week.
