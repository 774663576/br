[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]The latest COVID-19 vaccine
[00:03.72]is set for release in September.
[00:07.44]But health experts say it remains unclear
[00:12.24]how many Americans will choose to get the new shot.
[00:17.68]The efforts to prepare a new vaccine
[00:21.40]come as hospitals in the United States
[00:25.40]report increases in COVID-19 patients since early July.
[00:32.68]But the number of hospitalizations
[00:35.84]is still far below those reported earlier this year
[00:40.92]and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:45.80]A drop in infections has caused demand for the vaccine
[00:51.52]to fall sharply since the first shot became available in 2021.
[00:59.04]Officials say that overall,
[01:02.24]more than 240 million people in the U.S.
[01:07.04]had received at least one COVID-19 injection.
[01:12.72]That number represents about 73 percent
[01:17.16]of America's population.
[01:20.36]By autumn of 2022, fewer than 50 million people
[01:26.04]got the vaccine shots.
[01:28.60]By that time, most people in the U.S.
[01:32.52]had either been infected with COVID-19
[01:36.08]or had received at least one shot.
[01:40.12]Public health experts have advised people
[01:44.08]to look at COVID-19 vaccines
[01:47.56]the same as they do shots for other sicknesses,
[01:51.64]such as the flu.
[01:54.04]Flu vaccines are developed
[01:56.36]to fight the latest virus versions, called variants,
[02:01.44]and are generally administered once per flu season.
[02:07.04]But efforts to get people to seek COVID-19 shots
[02:11.96]are likely to be hurt
[02:13.96]by decreasing concern about the virus.
[02:18.40]Some people also question if the vaccines are safe.
[02:23.96]Healthcare providers and drug businesses
[02:28.16]have said they plan to start offering
[02:31.16]the new COVID-19 vaccine next month.
[02:36.08]The vaccine was developed to fight virus versions
[02:40.84]linked to the Omicron variant,
[02:43.92]which has been spreading in the U.S. since last year.
[02:49.40]Ashley Kirzinger is a lead researcher
[02:53.08]with the Kaiser Family Foundation.
[02:56.40]She told Reuters news agency
[02:59.52]that health officials need to send a clear message
[03:03.72]to the public that COVID-19 has not gone away.
[03:09.04]In addition, the messaging should note
[03:12.76]the new vaccine can protect individuals
[03:16.48]from serious sickness and hospitalization.
[03:21.20]Kirzinger noted her foundation has carried out
[03:25.08]public opinion studies on the issue.
[03:28.92]She said the top reason vaccinated people gave
[03:33.52]for rejecting more vaccinations
[03:36.44]was the belief that people were protected from the virus
[03:41.00]because of earlier shots or infections.
[03:45.20]The two largest COVID-19 vaccine makers
[03:50.08]– Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna – have predicted
[03:54.72]far less demand this autumn for the shots.
[03:59.48]Last year, vaccine sales by Pfizer and Moderna
[04:04.32]reached a combined $56 billion worldwide.
[04:10.24]This year, experts estimate the shots
[04:13.28]will bring in $20 billion for the companies.
[04:18.28]The COVID-19 public health emergency
[04:22.24]officially ended in May.
[04:25.16]Since then, the government has handed over
[04:28.48]much of the vaccination effort to private companies.
[04:33.36]More than 1.1 million people in the United States
[04:38.12]have died from COVID, the U.S. Centers
[04:42.00]for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports.
[04:48.20]The CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[04:53.88]are considering for approval
[04:56.32]the final versions of the new vaccine.
[05:00.32]CDC Director Mandy Cohen said last week
[05:05.00]she expects the shots to be launched
[05:08.04]during the third or fourth week of September.
