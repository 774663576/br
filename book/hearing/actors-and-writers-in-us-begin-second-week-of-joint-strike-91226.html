<p class="paragraph">For a week, actors including Tina Fey, Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Rosario Dawson, David Duchovny and other stars have joined working class performers and writers on<strong> picket</strong> lines.

<p class="paragraph">While many of the picket lines are in Los Angeles and New York, film and television production happens throughout the country.

[00:00.04]A combined strike by Hollywood actors
[00:04.64]and screenwriters is entering its second week
[00:09.24]with no sign of an end to the labor action.
[00:14.16]For a week, actors including Tina Fey,
[00:18.96]Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Rosario Dawson, David Duchovny
[00:26.52]and other stars have joined working class performers
[00:31.08]and writers on picket lines.
[00:34.76]They are protesting outside studios
[00:38.40]and corporate offices of streaming companies
[00:43.04]Amazon, MAX and Netflix.
[00:48.32]The famous actors' appearance on picket lines
[00:52.88]has provided additional star power
[00:56.44]and voices on issues central to both groups —
[01:01.40]better pay and protection from the use of artificial intelligence.
[01:08.88]About 65,000 actors — the large majority of whom
[01:15.24]do not make enough from acting to qualify
[01:18.52]for health care benefits through their union —
[01:22.24]along with 11,500 screenwriters, are on strike.
[01:29.84]While many of the picket lines are in Los Angeles and New York,
[01:36.16]film and television production happens throughout the country.
[01:41.24]Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Chicago, Illinois
[01:49.72]were among the major cities
[01:52.44]with strike events Tuesday and Wednesday.
[01:56.44]Later Friday, actors in Britain's capital, London,
[02:02.32]held an event in solidarity with the American workers.
[02:08.36]The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
[02:13.72]represents the studios and streaming companies.
[02:18.60]The group has said it offered both writers and actors
[02:23.84]substantial pay increases and have tried to meet other demands.
[02:32.04]Many on the picket lines have seized upon comments
[02:36.52]by their corporate bosses like Disney CEO Bob Iger,
[02:42.00]who last week called the workers' demands "not realistic."
[02:47.92]During an earnings event Wednesday,
[02:51.32]Netflix co-leader Ted Sarandos said he grew up
[02:56.16]in a union household and knows how difficult strikes are for workers.
[03:03.00]"We're super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible.
[03:08.48]One that's equitable and one that enables the unions,
[03:13.12]the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future," he said.
[03:20.88]Actor-writer Seth Green said streaming,
[03:24.72]which became a main media supplier during the pandemic,
[03:29.60]has hurt the livelihoods of those striking.
[03:34.24]"It all got broken. I mean, it sounds silly to say,
[03:39.80]but it's really as simple as that," Green said,
[03:43.52]speaking outside Paramount Studios in Hollywood Thursday.
[03:48.80]Traditional entertainment contracts
[03:51.56]used to pay actors and writers throughout the long lifespan
[03:56.04]of successful shows and movies.
[03:58.84]But no longer, he said.
[04:01.80]"If the company that owned the thing made a billion dollars,
[04:06.68]you'd get like a little bit of money from that."
[04:09.88]"All of that," Green said, "is gone."
