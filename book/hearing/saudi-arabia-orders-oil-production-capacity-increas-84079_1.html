阿布扎比的ADNOC公司周三表示，将从4月起将每天的石油产量从300万桶提升到400万桶。此外该公司还表示计划将日产量目标提高到500万桶。ADNOC公司称其计划提高产量是为了回应市场。</p>

[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]Saudi Arabia has directed the state oil company Aramco to increase its total possible oil production, or capacity.
[00:13.56]It announced the move at the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange Wednesday.
[00:21.76]A short time later, Abu Dhabi's oil and gas company ADNOC
[00:27.52]said it was increasing production by 25 percent to 4 million barrels per day.
[00:37.24]Saudi Arabia is working to flood the market after another oil producer, Russia, refused to agree to oil production cuts.
[00:50.60]Worldwide, demand for oil is decreasing as the spread of the new coronavirus
[00:57.88]has interfered with travel, transport and other industries.
[01:04.44]Saudi Arabia said earlier this week it would increase its oil production to 12.3 million barrels a day starting in April.
[01:16.00]That is 300,000 barrels per day more than Aramco's current production.
[01:24.16]Now the company says it will produce up to 13 million barrels per day.
[01:31.60]Aramco also said Wednesday that the Saudi Energy Ministry,
[01:37.40]led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the increase.
[01:44.12]Saudi Arabia had been producing around 9.8 million barrels per day.
[01:51.16]That amount was in line with an agreement among a number of oil producing nations, including Russia.
[01:59.56]The cuts were an attempt to stop the oversupply in the market that had pushed prices down.
[02:08.68]However, a few days ago, the kingdom's policy changed completely when Russia refused to go along with deeper cuts.
[02:20.20]Saudi Arabia is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.
[02:29.28]It is expected that other members of that group will also increase production.
[02:36.20]Abu Dhabi's ADNOC on Wednesday said it would increase output
[02:41.32]from about 3 million barrels to over 4 million barrels of oil a day starting in April.
[02:49.08]In addition, the company said it would move up its plans for a 5 million barrels a day production goal.
[02:57.60]ADNOC said its plan to increase production was made in reaction to the market.
[03:06.84]Experts say it appears Saudi Arabia hopes to pressure Russia by controlling market share in a price war.
[03:17.80]The price of unprocessed, or crude oil went down 25 percent on Monday.
[03:24.40]It was the sharpest decrease since the 1991 Gulf War.
[03:31.28]By yesterday, the price had increased a small amount.
[03:35.52]By the end of trading, oil was at $36 a barrel.
[03:42.08]Eurasia Group is a private business that researches and advises clients about political risk.
[03:49.44]It describes the current oil situation as a crisis that could last "several weeks or months,
[03:57.52]until prices are low enough to change fundamental views in Moscow and Riyadh" and force a compromise.
