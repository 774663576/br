[00:00.04]The American space agency NASA
[00:03.48]is providing details about a railway system
[00:07.68]it plans to build on the surface of the moon.
[00:11.72]The system aims to provide a "robotic transport system"
[00:17.04]to support future lunar activities of astronauts
[00:21.20]visiting the moon, NASA said in an online statement.
[00:26.28]The railway would be part of NASA's Artemis program.
[00:31.88]It seeks to return astronauts to the moon
[00:35.80]for the first time since 1972.
[00:40.00]The agency has set a target landing date
[00:43.76]of September 2026 to place astronauts
[00:48.28]on the surface of the moon.
[00:50.52]NASA has said it also plans
[00:54.00]to establish a long-term moon base
[00:57.84]where astronauts could do their own exploring
[01:01.12]and carry out science experiments.
[01:04.44]Agency officials have said the base
[01:08.16]could be built as soon as the 2030s.
[01:11.72]It could also serve as a possible
[01:15.00]launch site for future exploration of Mars.
[01:19.88]Last month, NASA also announced new efforts
[01:24.52]to develop and test new vehicle models
[01:28.04]designed to explore the moon.
[01:30.88]The lunar rail proposal is called
[01:34.40]the Flexible Levitation on a Track, or FLOAT.
[01:38.64]NASA said such a railway system
[01:42.32]will be "critical to the daily operations" on the moon.
[01:47.24]The main purpose of FLOAT
[01:49.48]would be to provide transportation services
[01:53.08]in areas of the moon where astronauts are active,
[01:57.16]the space agency said.
[01:59.60]This will include carrying loads of lunar soil
[02:03.96]and other materials
[02:05.52]to different areas of the lunar surface.
[02:08.76]NASA has said it plans to mine such soil,
[02:13.24]called regolith, for substances
[02:16.44]that could support astronaut activities on the moon.
[02:20.92]Regolith can contain materials like water
[02:25.48]or liquid forms of oxygen and hydrogen.
[02:29.52]Those elements could be used
[02:32.28]to support astronauts and their equipment
[02:35.68]during long stays on the moon.
[02:38.72]The other main use of the proposed railway
[02:42.92]would be to transport larger loads
[02:45.88]of materials and equipment
[02:48.36]to and from the areas where spacecraft land.
[02:53.12]The FLOAT system is already being developed
[02:57.24]by engineers at NASA's
[02:59.72]Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California.
[03:04.84]It is based on magnetic levitation
[03:08.64]– a commonly used technology
[03:11.48]in high-speed rail development.
[03:14.20]Drawings by NASA suggest the plans call for flat,
[03:19.68]magnetic panels, called robots, to float, or levitate,
[03:24.88]over a flat rail line, or track.
[03:28.28]The robots have no moving parts
[03:31.40]and are unpowered.
[03:33.12]They are pushed along the track
[03:35.56]by electromagnetic energy.
[03:38.24]NASA said the simple design
[03:41.48]of the carrier robots should help them last
[03:44.88]a long time and require little ongoing care.
[03:49.36]The system's tracks can be placed
[03:52.64]directly on the lunar surface,
[03:55.00]avoiding the need to build
[03:56.88]a complex, permanent structure.
[03:59.48]They could also be moved around
[04:02.16]to change the transportation path.
[04:05.12]A smaller version of the FLOAT system
[04:08.48]will permit robots to transport loads
[04:11.84]up to 30 kilograms at speeds
[04:14.68]of about 0.5 meters per second, the agency said.
[04:20.28]A larger system could also be built,
[04:23.68]to enable load transports involving
[04:26.40]up to 100,000 kilograms of regolith.
[04:30.44]Such a system could permit trips
[04:33.92]of "multiple kilometers per day," NASA explained.
[04:38.76]The agency is currently developing
[04:42.32]and testing different parts of the FLOAT system.
[04:46.52]FLOAT is one in a series
[04:49.88]of NASA development projects
[04:52.32]that recently received additional
[04:54.92]financial assistance to keep running.
[04:58.20]The projects are part of a NASA program
[05:01.96]called Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC).
[05:07.52]Each of the projects received
[05:10.20]"up to $600,000 to continue working
[05:14.76]over the next two years" to progress further.
[05:18.60]FLOAT and the other projects already passed
[05:22.52]NIAC's first development phase
[05:26.36]and are entering the second.
[05:28.68]If the efforts continue to show promise,
[05:32.00]they will be able to enter phase III,
[05:34.76]which provides additional funding
[05:37.36]and support from NASA.
[05:39.52]After that, the projects will be considered
[05:42.88]for a future space mission.
