[ar:Christopher Cruise]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]The sharp drop in world oil prices 
[00:02.62]has led oil companies in the United States 
[00:05.75]to dismiss thousands of workers. 
[00:08.36]Some companies have also suspended new oil drilling and exploration projects. 
[00:15.31]The drop in oil prices has also affected small service companies 
[00:22.01]and even stores that do business with oil companies 
[00:25.99]in big producer states like Texas. 
[00:29.16]But the drop in oil prices has not been bad for everyone.
[00:34.74]Oil platform workers are often called roughnecks. 
[00:39.85]In Texas, many roughnecks have lost their jobs 
[00:44.88]because of the drop in oil prices. 
[00:47.55]The effect of falling prices has been worse in states 
[00:52.90]like Alaska and North Dakota. 
[00:54.81]That is because production costs are higher there 
[00:58.88]than they are in the Eagle Ford area of south-central Texas.
[01:04.52]Some oil drilling projects are working to keep their costs low. 
[01:10.89]If the price of oil stays above $40 a barrel, 
[01:15.38]they can still make a profit.
[01:17.75]Adam Perdue is an economist at the University of Houston's Institute 
[01:23.83]for Regional Forecasting. 
[01:26.18]He has been studying the effect of falling oil prices in Texas.
[01:31.28]Mr. Perdue says oil company exploration and production budgets 
[01:37.30]are being cut between 10 and 50 percent, 
[01:40.93]with most of them being cut by a third. 
[01:44.33]He says the city of Houston 
[01:47.07]experienced five percent growth rates in recent years. 
[01:51.56]He thinks the lower spending will affect the local economy.
[01:56.60]"We're predicting that there's gonna be 20,000 fewer jobs 
[01:59.93]than there would have been otherwise. 
[02:02.96]So, we're still predicting growth in the Houston area; 
[02:05.43]it's just gonna slow down to a more reasonable rate of about, 
[02:08.46]or just under two percent."
[02:09.91]The economic slowdown will affect companies 
[02:14.32]that manufacture pipes and other equipment 
[02:18.01]for oil exploration and production. 
[02:20.95]It will also have an effect on trucking companies 
[02:25.39]that supply sand and chemicals, 
[02:28.01]and other small businesses that serve the energy industry.
[02:32.65]But low oil prices are good for chemical companies. 
[02:37.46]They use hydrocarbons found in oil to make fertilizer, 
[02:43.87]plastic and other products. 
[02:46.13]Adam Perdue says a new chemical plant project 
[02:50.56]near Houston will provide jobs for many skilled workers.
[02:54.97]"A lot of these roughnecks that are gonna lose their jobs out there 
[02:58.19]in the field are gonna be able to come home and, 
[03:00.30]and, and get a welding job or a construction job."
[03:03.04]He says oil industry experts believe prices will rise again 
[03:08.18]in about six months when the oversupply of oil is reduced. 
[03:13.65]Experts say the oversupply resulted from expanded production. 
[03:20.66]But he says if those predictions are wrong and oil prices continue to fall, 
[03:28.02]the economy of Houston and Texas will be hurt much more.
