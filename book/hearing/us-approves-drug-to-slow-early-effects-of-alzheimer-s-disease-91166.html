。
[00:00.04]U.S. officials gave full approval last week to Leqembi,
[00:07.04]a drug that moderately slows Alzheimer's disease.
[00:12.68]The disease affects the brain causing memory loss and dementia.
[00:20.04]The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[00:24.32]approval means the government's health coverage, Medicare,
[00:29.16]and other health insurance plans will help pay for the drug's cost.
[00:36.40]The FDA approved Leqembi for patients with mild dementia
[00:42.96]and other effects caused during the early stages of Alzheimer's.
[00:50.84]Leqembi is the first medicine
[00:54.16]shown to moderately slow the mental loss
[00:58.84]caused by Alzheimer's disease.
[01:02.04]The drug helps remove proteins
[01:05.60]that stick together and damage the brain.
[01:10.16]Final approval came after the FDA
[01:13.72]considered a study of 1,800 patients.
[01:18.88]The study showed the drug slowed losses in memory
[01:24.44]and decreases in thinking by about five months
[01:29.28]in those who received the medicine compared to those
[01:34.12]who received an ineffective substance.
[01:38.92]The drug carries a warning for serious side effects,
[01:43.44]such as possible bleeding in the brain.
[01:47.96]The warning notes that these side effects are found
[01:52.08]in other drugs that target harmful brain proteins.
[01:57.24]Last year, Medicare announced it would not pay for the drug
[02:02.20]unless the FDA gave it full approval.
[02:07.44]As a result, Alzheimer's patients
[02:10.40]and people supporting them pushed for final approval.
[02:15.68]A year's supply of Leqembi costs about $26,500.
[02:23.56]It is injected every two weeks.
[02:27.08]Some experts worry the drug's cost is too high.
[02:32.48]Medicare pays health care costs for about
[02:36.20]60 million Americans aged 65 or older.
[02:42.20]Medicare administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure
[02:46.32]confirmed last week that the program will begin paying for the drug
[02:51.96]now that it has full FDA approval.
[02:56.52]But the government is also requiring patients
[03:00.60]who receive the drug to enter a program
[03:03.76]that will collect information about the drug's safety and effectiveness.
[03:10.36]Medicare "will cover this medication broadly
[03:14.64]while continuing to gather data that will help us understand
[03:20.16]how the drug works," Brooks-LaSure said.
[03:24.12]Some Medicare patients may have to pay for
[03:28.32]20 percent of the cost of Leqembi.
[03:33.80]However, the amount will depend on the details
[03:37.60]of their insurance coverage plan.
[03:40.92]Hospitals and medical clinics have said it might take time
[03:45.88]to get people started on the drug.
[03:49.32]Doctors will need to test patients
[03:51.92]for the sticky brain proteins targeted by Leqembi.
[03:57.36]Nurses need to learn how to give the drug,
[04:01.28]which needs to be administered by intravenous injection.
[04:07.04]Patients also must undergo regular brain scans
[04:12.56]to look for bleeding or swelling.
[04:16.12]These brain images carry extra costs for hospitals.
[04:21.32]Japanese drug-maker Eisai developed Leqembi.
[04:25.96]The drug is co-marketed with Biogen,
[04:30.28]a company based in the eastern U.S. state of Massachusetts.
[04:35.92]Some Alzheimer's experts say patients,
[04:39.96]or their families might not notice
[04:42.80]the moderate difference the drug makes.
[04:46.80]But federal health advisors said the difference was important enough
[04:52.60]for them to suggest in June that the FDA approve the drug.
