。
[00:00.04]The American space agency's Mars explorer, Curiosity,
[00:06.12]has reached a new area of the planet Mars
[00:10.16]as it searches for evidence of water and possible life.
[00:16.32]The explorer, or rover, recently arrived at an area
[00:21.68]called the Gediz Vallis Channel.
[00:25.04]Researchers said the area was chosen
[00:29.08]because evidence suggested
[00:31.44]that it once held large amounts of liquid water.
[00:36.00]The term "channel" describes a natural bed that carries water.
[00:41.92]Curiosity arrived on Mars in 2012
[00:46.20]and began exploring areas
[00:49.04]around the planet's huge Gale Crater.
[00:52.80]Mars is a cold, dry desert today.
[00:57.40]But the Gale Crater area is believed to have contained
[01:02.12]a lake at one time
[01:04.36]and has shown other evidence
[01:06.56]of flowing water in the past.
[01:09.60]A large meteor strike
[01:12.56]about 3.7 billion years ago
[01:15.92]is believed to have formed the crater.
[01:19.28]At the time, scientists believe groundwater filled Gale Crater
[01:25.60]while additional water flowed in
[01:28.20]from rivers fed by rain or melting snow.
[01:32.36]This is thought to have formed
[01:35.56]Gale Crater's large lake.
[01:38.36]Since 2014, Curiosity has been exploring an area
[01:43.96]called Mount Sharp,
[01:46.04]which sits about five kilometers
[01:49.16]above the floor of Gale Crater.
[01:52.08]NASA said the new area contains formations
[01:56.72]created "over millions of years
[01:59.84]amid a changing Martian climate."
[02:03.12]Curiosity will be searching for evidence of ancient water
[02:08.76]in areas around Gediz Vallis Channel,
[02:12.96]with studies centered on how the channel formed.
[02:17.36]NASA scientists said they do not think wind formed it
[02:22.88]because the sides of it are too high.
[02:25.84]From space, the channel looks
[02:28.52]like an ancient riverbed, the agency said.
[02:32.56]Later, the channel filled with large rocks
[02:35.96]and other forms of debris.
[02:38.84]Last month, Curiosity documented
[02:42.56]the Gediz Vallis Channel
[02:44.68]with a 360-degree black-and-white picture
[02:49.12]captured by one of the rover's cameras.
[02:52.76]The rover's new exploring activities
[02:56.28]can provide scientists
[02:58.44]with "a new way to study how the presence of both water
[03:03.24]and the chemical ingredients required for life
[03:07.64]changed over time," NASA said.
[03:11.52]The first formations to be examined
[03:15.12]contain sulfates, which are salty minerals
[03:18.72]often created when liquid water evaporates.
[03:23.16]NASA said Curiosity also uncovered evidence
[03:27.92]of clay minerals in the Mount Sharp area.
[03:31.64]This suggests past interactions
[03:35.76]between large amounts of water and rock.
[03:39.44]Movements of water and minerals
[03:42.56]can also produce a material called sediment,
[03:46.68]particles that settle on the bottom of
[03:49.72]bodies of water over time.
[03:52.20]Examinations of these sediments
[03:55.64]can provide additional evidence
[03:58.04]of past water and possible life.
[04:02.44]Ashwin Vasavada is a Curiosity project scientist
[04:07.52]with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.
[04:11.92]He said in a statement,
[04:14.88]"If the channel or the debris pile
[04:17.76]were formed by liquid water,
[04:19.96]that's very interesting."
[04:22.16]Vasavada added, "It would mean that
[04:25.88]fairly late in the story of Mount Sharp –
[04:29.28]after a long dry period – water came back,
[04:33.20]and in a big way."
[04:35.36]NASA currently operates two rovers on Mars.
[04:40.40]The other one, Perseverance,
[04:42.68]has been exploring the planet's Jezero Crater
[04:46.36]since September 2021.
[04:49.64]It has collected rock, soil
[04:52.64]and atmospheric materials during that time.
[04:56.24]Jezero Crater is also believed to have contained
[05:01.08]large water bodies in the distant past.
[05:05.12]Materials collected by the rovers
[05:08.76]are expected to be returned to Earth in the future.
[05:12.96]That effort, a joint mission
[05:16.12]between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA),
[05:21.00]is planned for 2028.
