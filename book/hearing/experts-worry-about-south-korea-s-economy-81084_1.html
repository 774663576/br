<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Experts Worry About South Korea’s Economy]

。
[00:00.00]Economic experts are concerned about South Korea's economy.
[00:06.24]The Hyundai Research Institute recently suggested in a report
[00:12.06]that the economy "reached its peak in May 2017."
[00:18.10]The finding comes at a difficult time
[00:21.78]for South Korean President Moon Jae-in,
[00:25.67]whose public approval ratings have been falling.
[00:29.49]An opinion study by Gallup Korea shows Moon's approval rating
[00:36.12]at 45 percent, the lowest of his presidency.
[00:40.88]Also, a majority of businesses do not have a good opinion of him.
[00:47.75]The Hyundai Research Institute predicts that the South Korean economy
[00:54.90]will grow at a rate of 2.5 percent next year.
[01:00.21]That is lower than the Bank of Korea's prediction
[01:04.13]of 2.8 to 2.9 percent over the next two years.
[01:11.91]Kim So Young is an economics professor at Seoul National University.
[01:20.30]He told VOA that the economy is slowing down,
[01:25.36]but at present, "it's not at its worst."
[01:29.65]Chung Min is a research fellow with the Hyundai Research Institute.
[01:37.33]He predicts the economy will reach its lowest point
[01:43.07]during the second half of 2019.
[01:46.84]"The economy is faced with downward risks,
[01:51.62]such as deepening trade disputes," he said.
[01:55.51]Economists are also concerned about other issues,
[02:01.73]such as rising household debt, Kim So Young said.
[02:06.74]Taeyoon Sung is a professor in the School of Economics at Yonsei University.
[02:14.60]He said the Korean economy has lost competitiveness
[02:19.36]in the international marketplace.
[02:22.47]Sung said that the higher cost of wages for workers,
[02:27.38]including an increase in the minimum wage, have hurt businesses.
[02:33.86]On Monday, the South Korean president
[02:37.83]called for measures to increase economic growth.
[02:41.67]At a meeting with government ministers,
[02:45.51]Moon called for policies that add "innovation in regulation"
[02:52.01]and support for investment.
[02:54.70]He also called for lifting "regional economies and balanced development."
[03:01.52]Moon noted that it is difficult to "change an economy in a five-year term..."
[03:10.04]In South Korea, the president is limited to a single term of five years.
[03:17.25]He added that "changing the economic policy direction"
[03:23.10]takes time and requires patience.
[03:27.49]The Hyundai Research Institute's Chung Min said
[03:32.66]that rules do need to be changed to support investment in the economy.
[03:38.54]He called for more spending on what is called 
[03:42.53]social overhead capital, known as SOC.
[03:47.00]These are things that society considers important, like libraries,
[03:54.08]public parks and community projects, which are not directly linked to industry.
[04:01.52]Chung said an increase in SOC projects could ease a slowdown
[04:08.81]in the building industry "leading to a more active economy."
[04:14.06]The Hyundai Research Institute has called for economic changes,
[04:21.09]including a cut in interest rates.
[04:24.82]It also suggested that the budget permit additional spending in the first half of 2019.
[04:34.57]Kim So Young agreed that changes to current economic policies were wise
[04:42.64]because South Korea cannot control issues
[04:46.95]outside the country, such as trade disputes.
[04:52.04]I'm Mario Ritter Jr.
