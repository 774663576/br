<p>British scientists have found how a substance in the cannabis plant acts in the brain to reduce <strong>abnormal</strong> activity in patients at risk of <strong>psychosis</strong>.</p>
<p>Their findings suggest that the substance could be used in a possible treatment for the condition.</p>
<p>Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is illegal to grow, sell or use in many countries. Using powerful forms of cannabis can increase a person's chances of developing psychosis. But the substance the researchers studied, the chemical cannabidiol, appears to have the opposite effect.</p>

<p>Cannabidiol, or CBD, is non-intoxicating. That means it is unlike drugs or alcoholic products, which can affect the user's judgement or behavior.</p>
<p>CBD is the same cannabis substance that has also been shown to help patients with epilepsy, a disorder of the nervous system. This led to the approval in the United States of a cannabis-based drug, a specially processed form of CBD, in June.</p>
<p>Earlier research at King's College London had shown that CBD seemed to block the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol, the intoxicating substance in cannabis. But how this happened was a mystery.</p>
<p>Now, King's College researchers say they have more evidence of the health <strong>benefits</strong> of CBD.</p>
<p>Sagnik Bhattacharyya and his team gave 33 young people <strong>capsules</strong> containing the substance. All 33 subjects were experiencing signs of psychosis, although they had not been shown to have the <strong>full-blown</strong> mental condition.</p>
<p>The researchers studied images from the brains of the young people. They found that taking CBD capsules reduced abnormal activity in three areas of the brain: the striatum, medial temporal cortex and midbrain.</p>
<p>Abnormal activity in all three areas has been linked to the development of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Most current anti-psychotic drugs target the chemical dopamine. The brain uses dopamine to send signals from one nerve cell to another. But CBD works in a different way.</p>
<p>One major difference is that the body has an easier time dealing with CBD than other substances. CBD is less likely to cause harmful <strong>side effects</strong>, such as weight gain and other health problems linked to existing medicines.</p>
<p>Bhattacharyya told the Reuters news agency, "One of the reasons CBD is exciting is because it is very well <strong>tolerated</strong> compared to the other anti-psychotics we have available."</p>
<p>"There is an urgent need for a safe treatment for young people at risk of psychosis," he added.</p>
<p>The Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College now plans a 300-patient <strong>clinical</strong> trial of CBD as a treatment.</p>
<p>Researchers plan to start identifying subjects for the clinical trial in early 2019.</p>
<p>The latest findings show the complexity of the combination of chemicals found within the marijuana plant. They come at a time when many countries are beginning to make their laws against cannabis less severe.</p>
