<p>The yearly <a class="wsw__a" href="https://nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/">National Cherry Blossom Festival</a> will run through April 16 this year. It celebrates Japan's 1912 gift of 3,020 cherry trees to the city of Washington.</p>

[00:00.04]Thousands of Japanese cherry trees
[00:03.80]are blooming on the National Mall
[00:06.56]in Washington, D.C.
[00:09.60]When the trees reach peak bloom,
[00:12.80]the United States' capital city
[00:15.56]is awash in pink and white.
[00:19.52]In the 1920s,
[00:21.76]the average peak bloom date was April 5.
[00:26.88]That moved up to March 31 in recent years.
[00:32.40]And the 2023 peak
[00:35.44]arrived yet a week earlier,
[00:38.40]the National Park Service said last week.
[00:43.36]"I'm feeling like this is going to be the trend"
[00:47.12]because of climate change,
[00:48.92]said Matthew Morrison.
[00:51.88]He is the park service's urban forester
[00:55.88]charged with overseeing the trees' care.
[01:00.48]The yearly National Cherry Blossom Festival
[01:03.80]will run through April 16 this year.
[01:08.60]It celebrates Japan's 1912 gift
[01:12.76]of 3,020 cherry trees
[01:16.48]to the city of Washington.
[01:19.68]Two of those trees were planted by
[01:22.52]First Lady Helen Herron Taft
[01:25.52]and Viscountess Chinda,
[01:28.88]wife of the Japanese Ambassador
[01:31.64]to the United States,
[01:33.36]with just a few onlookers present.
[01:37.48]The average life of a Japanese cherry tree
[01:41.20]is between 30 and 40 years.
[01:44.76]Yet the two trees planted by Taft and Chinda
[01:50.04]and several others
[01:51.88]are still standing 111 years later.
[01:57.72]"That defies science," said Morrison.
[02:01.12]He credited the tree's long life to
[02:04.80]"a little bit of magic"
[02:06.68]and the year-round care his team provides.
[02:12.04]Many of the 3,700 trees blooming
[02:16.76]at the park today
[02:18.40]come from cuttings from the first trees,
[02:22.20]Morrison said.
[02:24.40]Others are regularly donated
[02:27.16]by the Casey Trees group of Washington.
[02:31.76]Morrison oversees a team of just three arborists.
[02:37.92]They are charged with caring for the cherry trees
[02:41.72]and keeping a "personal health record" for each.
[02:46.68]Three years ago,
[02:48.08]Morrison introduced
[02:49.52]the practice of mulching trees
[02:52.24]with large amounts of wood chips
[02:54.76]to help their growth.
[02:57.16]As the chips break down, he said,
[03:00.04]they release fungi and bacteria
[03:03.80]to help the tree's roots.
[03:06.76]The wood chips also serve as a barrier
[03:10.12]between the grass and the trees.
[03:12.92]This prevents accidental cuts
[03:16.20]caused by lawn equipment.
[03:19.40]Morrison suggests the same practice
[03:22.52]for homeowners growing trees
[03:24.80]in their own yards.
[03:27.36]When wood chips are applied
[03:29.80]over the root areas, he said,
[03:32.44]"it would never need any fertilizer,
[03:35.72]amendments" or more water.
[03:38.92]"Even on the hottest days of summer
[03:41.88]when it hasn't rained,
[03:43.88]I dig down in the wood chips
[03:46.36]and find moisture," he said.
[03:50.08]Morrison said most of the National Mall's
[03:53.48]cherry blossom trees are Yoshino.
[03:56.48]"It's one of the best growers
[03:59.08]and the best to flower," he said.
[04:02.32]"Kwanzan cherry also is a good grower
[04:05.72]and gets a little bigger than Yoshino."
[04:09.56]As for the National Cherry Blossom Festival,
[04:12.36]there are still several events
[04:14.88]throughout Washington and its suburbs.
[04:17.80]They include a Japanese street festival,
[04:21.68]running events, fireworks,
[04:24.84]and food festivals.
[04:26.96]If you cannot make it,
[04:29.36]there is a Bloom Cam
[04:31.56]to look at the cherry blossoms.
