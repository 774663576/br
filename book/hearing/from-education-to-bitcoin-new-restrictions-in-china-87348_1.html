几个月来，中国一直在加大对在中国运营的私营企业的监管。以下是面临全新监管措施的行业：
<p><strong>Education
教育</strong></p>
<p>In education, measures began on Saturday barring private, for-profit tutoring companies from raising investments outside the country.<br/>
教育方面，周六开始采取措施，禁止营利性私营教辅机构到海外筹集资金。</p>
<p>The new rules also said tutoring centers must operate as non-profit organizations. They also cannot offer subjects already taught in public day schools or hold classes on weekends or holidays.<br/>
这些新规定还表示，补习中心必须作为非营利机构运作。他们也不能在周末和节假日提供公立走读学校已经教授的科目或上课。</p>
<p>China's competitive higher education system has made tutoring services very popular with parents. Private tutoring is a $120 billion industry in the country and includes several companies based overseas. But to increase the nation's slow birthrate, the government has been trying to lower the cost of raising children.<br/>
中国竞争激烈的高等教育体系使得补习服务颇受家长欢迎。私营补习在该国是一个价值1200亿美元的产业，其中包括几家海外上市公司。但是为了提高该国的出生率，政府一直在努力降低抚养孩子的成本。</p>
<p><strong>Online finance<br/>
网络金融</strong></p>
<p>In November, China's banking regulators put out draft rules calling for stronger controls for online lending. The company Ant Group is a major lender. Ant Group is a part of the larger Alibaba Group, a Chinese company specializing in technology, finance and online product sales.<br/>
去年11月，中国银行业监管机构出台了规则草案，呼吁加强对网贷的控制。蚂蚁集团是一家重要的借贷机构。蚂蚁集团是更大的阿里巴巴集团的一部分，阿里巴巴集团是一家专门从事科技、金融和产品在线销售的中国企业。</p>
<p>The rules set limits for online loans between provinces and put a limit on loan amounts for individuals.<br/>
该规定限制了跨省网贷的规模，并对个人贷款金额做出了限制。</p>
<p>In April, the regulator demanded that Ant Group separate its payment business from its personal finance business.<br/>
今年4月，监管机构要求蚂蚁集团将支付业务和个人金融业务分开。</p>
<p><strong>Online commerce<br/>
在线商务</strong></p>
<p>Regulators have also cracked down on traditional online commerce, or product sales.<br/>
监管机构还严厉打击了传统在线商务或是产品销售。</p>
<p>In April, the State Administration of Market Regulation fined Alibaba Group $2.75 billion. It was the company's highest fine yet. The regulator says Alibaba had been preventing its product sellers from selling their goods on other websites.<br/>
今年4月，中国国家市场监督管理总局对阿里巴巴集团罚款27.5亿美元。这是该公司迄今为止最大一笔罚款。监管机构表示，阿里巴巴一直阻止其产品卖家在其它网站上销售他们的产品。</p>
<p>The regulator has also fined smaller companies for their practices related to consumer rights and labor.<br/>
监管机构还对更小企业在消费者权益和劳工方面的做法做出了罚款。</p>
<p>In May, it fined the company JD.com 300,000 yuan for publishing false information about its food products. JD.com is a major competitor of Alibaba.<br/>
今年5月，京东因为发布虚假食品信息而被罚款30万人民币。京东是阿里巴巴的主要竞争对手。</p>
<p>This week, the regulator ordered China's food drop-off companies to provide better protection for workers.<br/>
本周，监管机构下令中国外卖企业为员工提供更好的保护。</p>
<p><strong>Ride sharing<br/>
共享出行</strong></p>
<p>In June, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, told top ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing to stop taking new users.<br/>
今年6月，中国国家互联网信息办公室通知头部共享出行企业滴滴出行停止接收新用户。</p>
<p>At first, the regulator named violations of consumer privacy as a reason for barring new riders. Later it put out separate draft rules for other Chinese companies to run a security check before listing stocks overseas.<br/>
起初，监管机构将侵犯消费者隐私列为禁止新用户的原因。随后监管机构出台了单独的规则草案，让其它中国企业在海外上市前进行安全检查。</p>
<p>A CAC investigation led to a fine of 500,000 yuan for Didi and other companies for not reporting their takeovers of smaller companies.<br/>
中国国家互联网信息办公室的一项调查导致滴滴和其它企业被罚款50万人民币，原因是他们在收购更小企业时没有上报。</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin<br/>
比特币</strong></p>
<p>In May, three financial regulators widened rules on China's cryptocurrency industry. They barred banks and online payment companies from use of cryptocurrency for payment or legal settlement.<br/>
今年5月，三大监管机构扩大了对中国加密货币行业的规定。他们禁止银行和在线支付企业使用加密货币进行支付或清算。</p>
<p>They also barred companies from providing exchange services between cryptocurrencies and national moneys, among other rules.<br/>
在其它规定方面，他们还禁止企业提供加密货币和国家货币之间的兑换服务。</p>
<p>In the following weeks came measures from provincial governments to prevent bitcoin mining.<br/>
在接下来的几周里，各省出台了禁止比特币挖矿的措施。</p>
<p>Those measures caused a series of mining closures around the country. Chinese newspaper Global Times predicts that 90 percent of mining operations will soon close.<br/>
这些措施导致全国各地的一系列挖矿业务被关闭。中国《环球日报》预测90%的挖矿业务将很快被关闭。</p>

。
[00:01.48]For months, China has been increasing restrictions
[00:06.48]on private companies operating in the country.
[00:11.88]Here are the industries facing new measures:
[00:16.68]In education, measures began on Saturday
[00:21.08]barring private, for-profit tutoring companies
[00:26.16]from raising investments outside the country.
[00:31.64]The new rules also said tutoring centers
[00:35.64]must operate as non-profit organizations.
[00:40.16]They also cannot offer subjects
[00:44.08]already taught in public day schools
[00:47.36]or hold classes on weekends or holidays.
[00:52.08]China's competitive higher education system
[00:56.96]has made tutoring services very popular with parents.
[01:02.64]Private tutoring is a $120 billion industry in the country
[01:09.36]and includes several companies based overseas.
[01:15.44]But to increase the nation's slow birthrate,
[01:19.20]the government has been trying
[01:21.32]to lower the cost of raising children.
[01:25.76]In November, China's banking regulators
[01:29.52]put out draft rules calling for stronger controls
[01:34.16]for online lending.
[01:37.28]The company Ant Group is a major lender.
[01:42.28]Ant Group is a part of the larger Alibaba Group,
[01:46.88]a Chinese company specializing in technology,
[01:51.96]finance and online product sales.
[01:57.08]The rules set limits for online loans
[02:00.68]between provinces and put a limit
[02:03.64]on loan amounts for individuals.
[02:07.84]In April, the regulator demanded
[02:11.00]that Ant Group separate its payment business
[02:15.08]from its personal finance business.
[02:19.36]Regulators have also cracked down
[02:22.64]on traditional online commerce, or product sales.
[02:28.60]In April, the State Administration of Market Regulation
[02:33.44]fined Alibaba Group $2.75 billion.
[02:41.00]It was the company's highest fine yet.
[02:45.16]The regulator says Alibaba
[02:49.44]had been preventing its product sellers
[02:53.16]from selling their goods on other websites.
[02:57.84]The regulator has also fined smaller companies
[03:02.48]for their practices related to consumer rights and labor.
[03:09.40]In May, it fined the company JD.com 300,000 yuan
[03:17.64]for publishing false information about its food products.
[03:23.00]JD.com is a major competitor of Alibaba.
[03:30.68]This week, the regulator ordered China's food drop-off companies
[03:37.24]to provide better protection for workers.
[03:41.76]In June, the Cyberspace Administration of China,
[03:47.04]or CAC, told top ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing
[03:54.20]to stop taking new users.
[03:58.40]At first, the regulator named violations
[04:02.92]of consumer privacy as a reason for barring new riders.
[04:10.04]Later it put out separate draft rules for other Chinese companies
[04:16.04]to run a security check before listing stocks overseas.
[04:22.96]A CAC investigation led to a fine of 500,000 yuan
[04:30.80]for Didi and other companies
[04:34.28]for not reporting their takeovers of smaller companies.
[04:40.04]In May, three financial regulators widened rules
[04:45.52]on China's cryptocurrency industry.
[04:50.16]They barred banks and online payment companies
[04:54.28]from use of cryptocurrency for payment or legal settlement.
[05:01.44]They also barred companies from providing exchange services
[05:06.68]between cryptocurrencies and national moneys, among other rules.
[05:13.72]In the following weeks came measures

[05:22.68]Those measures caused a series
[05:25.48]of mining closures around the country.
[05:30.04]Chinese newspaper Global Times

[05:40.48]On Friday, China's housing ministry and seven other regulators
[05:46.44]told the property management industry to "improve order."
[05:52.72]China's economy has improved after a drop in 2020

[06:12.00]Other regulatory measures include
[06:15.12]borrowing limits for property developers
[06:18.52]and limits on property loans from banks.
[06:23.88]So, what might come next?
[06:27.52]Some experts say the gaming industry
[06:31.04]is next to face tough regulations.
[06:35.88]China's central government has continued to express concern

[06:46.24]The government will likely target the many games
[06:50.20]being published without official permissions,
[06:53.96]or ones that misuse user information.
[06:59.44]That prediction comes from Rich Bishop.

[07:23.68]It also demanded changes
[07:26.12]to the country's complex healthcare system.
