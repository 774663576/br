<p>Stars have served us in many ways throughout human history. So, it is not surprising that we have an expression that thanks them.</p>
<p>When we say, <u>thank your lucky stars</u>, we are expressing <strong>gratitude</strong> for something. We use this expression to show our <strong>appreciation</strong> for something good in our lives. For example, I <u>thank my lucky stars</u> for my health and also a career that I love.</p>
<p>We often use the expression with the word "should." For example: <em>My friend <u>should thank her lucky stars</u> for her amazing brother. He has helped her many times over the years. </em></p>
<p>This saying means that you should be grateful for your good luck. <u>Thanking the stars</u> in ancient times may have been a type of <strong>superstition</strong>. But these days, it simply means we are thankful.</p>
<p>Let's hear what some of my co-workers thank their lucky stars for.</p>
<p>First is Dan Friedell:</p>
<p><em>I thank my lucky stars for the people who came before me and taught me lessons about life I put into practice today. </em></p>
<p>And here is Dorothy Gundy:</p>
<p><em>I thank my lucky stars that the rain has stopped and the children can play outdoors.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes we use the word "count" in this expression. Saying I <u>count my lucky stars</u> doesn't change the meaning. For example: I <u>count my lucky stars</u> for my family and friends.</p>
<p>Now let's hear this expression used in a <strong>conversation</strong>:</p>
<p><em>A: Are you okay? You look terrible.</em></p>
<p><em>B: I rear-ended a garbage truck on my drive over here.</em></p>
<p><em>A: Oh no! Was anyone hurt?</em></p>
<p><em>B: No, thankfully. But I really damaged my car. It's going to cost a lot to fix it. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, crashing into the back of a trash truck will do that. What happened?</em></p>
<p><em>B: I dropped a piece of chocolate and looked down for a minute to find it. When I looked up, the trash truck was stopped right in front of me. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Wow. You should <u>count your lucky stars</u> that you weren't seriously injured. </em></p>
<p><em>B: I know! I'm very thankful. And I need to be more careful. But in my defense ... it was really good chocolate. </em></p>
<p>We here at VOA Learning English thank our lucky stars for all of our listeners.</p>
<p>What do you <u>count your lucky stars</u> for? Tell us in the comment section or send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="mailto:Learningenglish@voanews.com">Learningenglish@voanews.com</a>.</p>

[00:00.04]Now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.32]from VOA Learning English.
[00:20.04]Looking up at a star-filled night sky
[00:23.88]can be one of the most beautiful sights to see.
[00:27.72]It can fill you with awe and amazement.
[00:32.76]It can also take us away
[00:34.80]from our worldly troubles and problems.
[00:39.00]A long time ago, people may have looked to the stars
[00:43.32]for more than inspiration and entertainment.
[00:48.20]Ancient star-gazers may have looked
[00:50.88]to the stars to find good luck.
[00:53.92]In modern times, people who believe in astrology
[00:58.88]also look to the stars for guidance
[01:02.20]and advice on how to improve their lives.
[01:07.84]Stars have served us in many ways throughout human history.
[01:13.04]So, it is not surprising
[01:15.72]that we have an expression that thanks them.
[01:20.32]When we say, thank your lucky stars,
[01:23.32]we are expressing gratitude for something.
[01:27.32]We use this expression to show
[01:29.88]our appreciation for something good in our lives.
[01:34.72]For example, I thank my lucky stars for my health
[01:39.16]and also a career that I love.
[01:43.08]We often use the expression with the word "should."
[01:47.08]For example: My friend should thank her lucky stars
[01:51.88]for her amazing brother.
[01:54.04]He has helped her many times over the years.
[01:59.40]This saying means that you should be grateful
[02:02.08]for your good luck.
[02:04.52]Thanking the stars in ancient times
[02:07.36]may have been a type of superstition.
[02:11.08]But these days, it simply means we are thankful.
[02:16.44]Let's hear what some of my co-workers
[02:19.04]thank their lucky stars for.
[02:21.52]First is Dan Friedell:
[02:24.48]I thank my lucky stars for the people who came before me
[02:28.24]and taught me lessons about life I put into practice today.
[02:33.96]And here is Dorothy Gundy:
[02:36.72]I thank my lucky stars that the rain has stopped
[02:40.48]and the children can play outdoors.
[02:44.24]Sometimes we use the word "count" in this expression.
[02:49.72]Saying I count my lucky stars doesn't change the meaning.
[02:54.64]For example: I count my lucky stars
[02:58.12]for my family and friends.
[03:02.20]Now let's hear this expression used in a conversation:
[03:06.44]A: Are you okay? You look terrible.
[03:10.12]B: I rear-ended a garbage truck on my drive over here.
[03:14.68]A: Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
[03:17.52]B: No, thankfully.
[03:20.48]But I really damaged my car.
[03:23.40]It's going to cost a lot to fix it.
[03:26.56]A: Well, crashing into the back of a trash truck will do that.
[03:31.68]What happened?
[03:33.48]B: I dropped a piece of chocolate
[03:36.08]and looked down for a minute to find it.
[03:39.08]When I looked up,
[03:41.12]the trash truck was stopped right in front of me.
[03:44.76]A: Wow. You should count your lucky stars
[03:48.72]that you weren't seriously injured.
[03:51.76]B: I know! I'm very thankful.
[03:54.80]And I need to be more careful.
[03:57.52]But in my defense ... it was really good chocolate.
[04:04.76]We here at VOA Learning English
[04:07.52]thank our lucky stars for all of our listeners.
[04:12.00]What do you count your lucky stars for?
[04:15.00]Tell us in the comment section or send us an email
[04:19.64]at Learningenglish@voanews.com.
[04:24.20]And that's all for this week's Words and Their Stories.
[04:29.24]Until next time,
[04:31.08]I'm Anna Matteo.
