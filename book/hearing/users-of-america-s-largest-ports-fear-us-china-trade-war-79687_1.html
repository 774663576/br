<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Users of America’s Largest Ports Fear US-China Trade War]

。
[00:00.20]The combined California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
[00:06.00]are the largest in the United States.
[00:10.00]An estimated $417 billion worth of goods
[00:16.90]pass through the two ports each year.
[00:20.96]About $362 billion of that comes from trade with the Asia Pacific area.
[00:30.08]But businesses using the ports are expecting a sharp rise in shipping costs
[00:39.28]because of tariffs announced by the United States and China.
[00:45.30]Liang Liang owns an import company in Los Angeles
[00:50.68]that deals mainly with toys and clothes from China.
[00:56.23]He told VOA he has had concerns about his business in recent weeks
[01:03.28]after hearing about planned tariff increases.
[01:07.92]"I have been watching the news every day.
[01:11.44]When will the tariffs be put in place?
[01:13.59]When are my goods arriving?
[01:14.92]It's a fight against time.
[01:16.52]I'm trying to order all my products for the rest of the year."
[01:20.28]Liang said he expects a 10- to 20-percent increase in shipping costs
[01:27.00]if a trade war breaks out between the U.S. and China.
[01:33.05]He said if tariffs were to increase more than 20 percent,
[01:38.80]he would be forced to raise the prices of his goods.
[01:43.72]Stephen Cheung is president of the Los Angeles-based World Trade Center.
[01:52.08]The center provides assistance to international companies
[01:56.92]seeking to bring or expand operations in the area.
[02:02.39]He said that as tariffs from both countries increase the cost of goods,
[02:09.80]manufacturers and sellers may order fewer products.
[02:15.64]This, Cheung said, would result in a decrease in overall trade
[02:22.08]between the U.S. and China.
[02:25.11]"Once that happens, you're going to see an increase in the rates for shipping.
[02:30.12]Because when you don't have the volume to justify the goods going back and forth,
[02:34.52]you are going to see a further increase in that shipping cost."
[02:37.76]Cheung said this rise in shipping costs
[02:41.64]would eventually result in higher prices for people buying the products.
[02:48.35]Other officials at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
[02:53.96]say it is still too early to tell what effect additional trade tariffs will have.
[03:01.73]Duane Kenagy is currently deputy director of the Port of Long Beach.
[03:09.48]He told VOA that so far, the port has seen record container business this year.
[03:17.57]For now, Kenagy is waiting to see how different businesses
[03:22.96]change their supply operations to deal with the tariff environment.
[03:28.76]But he warned that a continuing trade war could be "devastating"
[03:35.72]to both the U.S. and Chinese economies.
[03:40.72]President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have accused China
[03:47.60]of carrying out unfair trading practices.
[03:52.00]The officials say tariffs are needed to reduce a large trade imbalance.
[03:59.26]The United States imported more than $500 billion in Chinese goods last year,
[04:08.48]compared to $130 billion in U.S. products exported to China.
[04:17.40]Importer Liang Liang remains hopeful that a U.S.-China trade war can be avoided.
[04:25.96]He said he thought recent announcements on tariffs
[04:29.92]were made for political purposes and may not last.
[04:35.76]Stephen Cheung said he understands the reasons the United States
[04:41.81]decided to announce heavy tariffs on Chinese imports.
[04:47.36]But he urged administration officials to carefully consider
[04:53.08]how such changes will affect local importers.
[04:58.12]"What are the steps you're going to use to mitigate some of these damages
[05:04.72]that will be happening to the local community?
[05:08.56]These are huge issues that have not been addressed yet," he said.
