。
[00:00.04]During his more than 60-year acting career,
[00:05.48]James Earl Jones' voice
[00:07.84]became a star of its own.
[00:11.28]Jones died this week at the age of 93.
[00:16.68]One of Jones' career decisions
[00:19.32]continues to be an issue of debate:
[00:23.16]his permission to let artificial intelligence (AI)
[00:28.92]reproduce his performances
[00:31.60]as Darth Vader for new projects.
[00:35.92]Skywalker Sound
[00:37.56]and Ukrainian software company Respeecher
[00:41.76]used AI to recreate Jones' Darth Vader
[00:47.04]for the 2022 show Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:53.00]The show appears on the streaming service Disney+.
[00:58.72]The voice of actor Mark Hamill
[01:01.68]was also "de-aged" using Respeecher.
[01:06.56]Hamill played Luke Skywalker
[01:09.16]in the first Star Wars movie.
[01:12.36]His AI-manufactured voice
[01:15.00]was used in the series' television show
[01:18.64]The Mandalorian.
[01:21.28]Disney+ launched the show in 2019.
[01:26.80]Voice actors say they fear AI
[01:30.20]could reduce the number of jobs
[01:32.96]because the technology can reproduce
[01:36.64]one performance into many.
[01:39.96]The concern led American
[01:43.08]unionized video game performers
[01:45.96]to go on strike in July.
[01:50.00]For some observers, Jones' decision
[01:53.32]to permit AI to reproduce his voice
[01:56.60]raises questions about voice acting as an art.
[02:02.16]But the decision
[02:03.36]also could help develop AI agreements
[02:06.60]that fairly pay actors
[02:09.00]for AI-based performances.
[02:13.04]Zeke Alton is a voice actor
[02:16.48]and member of SAG-AFTRA's interactive
[02:20.40]media agreement negotiating committee.
[02:24.60]He said it is "amazing"
[02:27.24]that Jones was involved in the process
[02:30.08]of reproducing his voice.
[02:33.04]"If the game companies,
[02:34.88]the movie companies, gave the consent,
[02:38.20]compensation transparency to every actor
[02:41.80]that they gave James Earl Jones,
[02:44.64]we wouldn't be on strike," Alton said.
[02:48.32]"It proves that they can do it.
[02:50.88]They just don't want to
[02:52.84]for people that they feel
[02:54.96]don't have the leverage
[02:56.84]to bargain for themselves."
[03:00.16]Hollywood's video game performers
[03:03.00]called for a strike after more than 18 months
[03:07.36]of negotiations over a new
[03:10.56]interactive media agreement
[03:13.00]with industry leaders.
[03:15.80]The negotiators could not reach an agreement
[03:19.60]on artificial intelligence protections.
[03:24.32]Members of the union have said
[03:26.64]they are not opposed to AI.
[03:30.40]They say they are worried, however,
[03:33.36]that technology could replace them.
[03:37.16]Concerns over such use of AI
[03:40.44]were among the reasons that film
[03:42.88]and television workers went on strike last year.
[03:47.96]The work stoppages went on for four months.
[03:53.20]Neither Skywalker Sound nor Respeecher

[04:20.52]The worker added that Jones
