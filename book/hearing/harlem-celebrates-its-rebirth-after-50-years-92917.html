。
[00:02.28]In the 1970s,
[00:04.00]a lack of community investment
[00:06.72]resulted in a large number of people
[00:09.08]leaving Harlem, a well-known
[00:11.32]New York City neighborhood in northern Manhattan.
[00:15.00]Nearly 50,000 people,
[00:17.00]about a third of the area's population,
[00:19.96]left to escape violence,
[00:22.20]crime and poor living conditions.
[00:25.64]Among those who left
[00:26.88]was LeeSandra Moore's mother
[00:29.12]who moved to the state of Virginia.
[00:32.20]"It was a scary time," said Moore,
[00:34.76]now 52 and still living in Harlem.
[00:37.76]"I couldn't blame her for that."
[00:41.08]Those who stayed were mostly poor, Black families.
[00:44.72]They lived through unrest that followed
[00:47.32]the 1964 killing of an unarmed Black teenager
[00:51.44]and the killings of Black leader Malcolm X in 1965
[00:56.00]and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.
[01:01.00]News reports described Harlem as a "sinking ship."
[01:05.56]Percy Sutton was president
[01:07.68]of the local Manhattan government at the time.
[01:10.96]As the city's highest-ranking Black official,
[01:13.76]he knew Harlem needed a lift
[01:16.16]and started a festival called Harlem Day in 1974.
[01:21.96]Sutton called up elected officials.
[01:24.28]He gathered actors,
[01:25.76]like Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee,
[01:28.28]entertainers, including Tito Puente and Max Roach,
[01:32.12]and the poet Maya Angelou
[01:34.52]to celebrate the first Harlem Day.
[01:38.08]It honored Harlem's history
[01:40.20]and shows how the neighborhood
[01:41.64]became known as "Black Mecca"
[01:43.84]or the center of Black arts,
[01:45.96]culture and businesses.
[01:48.72]"It was such a successful day," said Lloyd Williams
[01:52.28]— one of Harlem Day's co-founders
[01:54.80]and the current president
[01:56.36]of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce
[01:58.68]— that it became a week-long yearly event
[02:01.96]called Harlem Week.
[02:04.24]This year, Harlem Week
[02:05.84]celebrated its 50th anniversary
[02:08.40]with 18 days filled with free programming.
[02:12.64]The celebration included food,
[02:14.84]Broadway performances, an Apollo Hour,
[02:18.32]and a tribute to entertainer Harry Belafonte.
[02:22.68]It offered financial education and career training,
[02:26.04]and for children, back-to-school backpacks.
[02:30.32]One important part of Harlem Week was an effort
[02:33.96]to deal with Harlem's long-standing health crises.
[02:38.40]Medical volunteers checked blood pressure
[02:41.36]and tested for cancer and diabetes.
[02:44.88]People learned about drug use,
[02:46.84]HIV/AIDS and healthy aging.
[02:50.68]Rev. Al Sharpton
[02:52.24]leads the National Action Network in Harlem.
[02:56.04]He said, "Harlem Week has been the constant line

[03:01.24]of America's most historic Black neighborhood."
[03:05.12]Organizers and people say Harlem Week
[03:08.20]has brought new life to the area.
[03:11.52]The once-deserted neighborhood
[03:13.44]is now home to restored buildings,

[03:19.12]The streets are filled with jazz, reggae,

[03:26.00]Moore, the Harlem native
[03:27.92]whose mother moved to Virginia,
[03:30.16]watched as big national stores moved in.
[03:33.88]Sometimes they took the place of local shops
