<p>The first expression involves trash and treasure.</p>
<p>When we say <u>one person's trash is another person's treasure</u>,<strong> </strong>we mean that something that one person may consider worthless could be highly prized or valued by someone else.</p>
<p>Let's hear an example of how to use this expression:</p>
<p><em>A: I really don't understand the appeal of Jackson Pollock's paintings. To me, they look like a team of m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s painted them!" </em></p>
<p><em>B: I love Pollock's paintings. I see something new every time I look at them. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, I guess it's true what they say, <u>one person's trash is another person's treasure</u>.</em></p>
<p>Now, rubbish and garbage mean the same as trash. But, in this expression, we use trash because the “tr” in <u>trash</u> and <u>treasure</u> makes the expression sound more natural. It just sounds better.</p>
<p>And, sometimes, we use the word "man" in place of "person" such as <u>one man's trash is another man's treasure</u>. Again it is just easier to say.</p>
<p>Another expression with a similar meaning is <u>different strokes for different folks</u>.</p>
<p>This also means that different things appeal to different people. But as a set expression, we do not say “different strokes for different people.” That just doesn't sound right.</p>
<p><u>Different strokes for different folks</u> can also mean that people live in different ways and value different things.</p>
<p>For example, a perfect evening for my friend is to go out and dance all night long. For me, a perfect evening is to stay at home with a book and a cup of tea. Neither is a better way to spend the evening. So, we should not judge. Or in other words, <u>different strokes for different folks</u>.</p>
<p>When we want to say that we are all different and we like different things without judgment, we can also use the following expressions:</p>
<p><u>It takes all kinds to make the world go round.</u></p>
<p><u>It takes all kinds.</u></p>
<p><u>To each his (her) own. </u></p>

。
[00:08.12]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.88]from VOA Learning English.
[00:18.64]People around the world
[00:20.76]share many things in common.
[00:23.68]But we are also different from each other.
[00:28.56]Not only do we look,
[00:30.72]think, and act differently,
[00:33.48]but we also like different things.
[00:37.68]Even identical twins
[00:40.00]may look the same
[00:41.76]but are very different individuals.
[00:45.92]On today's program,
[00:47.60]we will look at a few expressions
[00:50.20]to describe how no person
[00:53.16]is exactly the same as another.
[00:56.96]The first expression
[00:58.88]involves trash and treasure.
[01:03.24]When we say one person's trash
[01:05.96]is another person's treasure,
[01:08.32]we mean that something
[01:10.64]that one person may consider worthless
[01:14.00]could be highly prized
[01:16.12]or valued by someone else.
[01:19.76]Let's hear an example
[01:21.68]of how to use this expression:
[01:25.40]A: I really don't understand
[01:27.08]the appeal of Jackson Pollock's paintings.
[01:29.76]To me, they look like
[01:31.64]a team of monkeys painted them!"
[01:34.64]B: I love Pollock's paintings.
[01:37.44]I see something new
[01:38.80]every time I look at them.
[01:41.68]A: Well, I guess it's true what they say,
[01:44.56]one person's trash
[01:46.04]is another person's treasure.
[01:49.68]Now, rubbish and garbage
[01:52.40]mean the same as trash.
[01:55.24]But, in this expression,
[01:57.48]we use trash
[01:59.64]because the "tr" in trash
[02:02.88]and treasure makes the expression
[02:06.08]sound more natural.
[02:08.52]It just sounds better.
[02:11.44]And, sometimes, we use the word "man"
[02:14.92]in place of "person"
[02:17.24]such as one man's trash
[02:19.68]is another man's treasure.
[02:22.40]Again it is just easier to say.
[02:26.48]Another expression with a similar meaning
[02:29.60]is different strokes for different folks.
[02:34.36]This also means that different things
[02:37.40]appeal to different people.
[02:40.68]But as a set expression,
[02:43.00]we do not say
[02:44.36]"different strokes for different people."
[02:47.32]That just doesn't sound right.
[02:51.16]Different strokes for different folks
[02:53.60]can also mean that people
[02:55.80]live in different ways
[02:58.28]and value different things.
[03:02.04]For example, a perfect evening
[03:04.84]for my friend is to go out
[03:07.72]and dance all night long.
[03:11.52]For me, a perfect evening
[03:14.04]is to stay at home with a book
[03:16.80]and a cup of tea.
[03:19.08]Neither is a better way to spend the evening.
 [03:22.64]So, we should not judge.
[03:25.40]Or in other words,
[03:26.84]different strokes for different folks.
[03:30.40]When we want to say
[03:32.00]that we are all different
[03:33.72]and we like different things without judgment,
[03:37.68]we can also use the following expressions:
[03:42.28]It takes all kinds to make the world go round.
[03:46.16]It takes all kinds.
[03:48.32]To each his own.
[03:50.24]Or to each her own
[03:52.64]Whatever floats your boat.
[03:55.60]They all mean ...
[03:56.92]whatever makes you happy!
[03:59.80]And all of these expressions
[04:01.84]have the same general meaning:
[04:04.40]We are all different and unique.
[04:06.96]And that's the end
[04:09.76]of this Words and Their Stories.
[04:12.28]Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.
