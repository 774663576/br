[00:00.04]Ben Bernanke, former head of the U.S. Federal Reserve,
[00:04.56]and two other American economists
[00:06.84]were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences on Monday.
[00:11.60]Bernanke is credited with helping lead the United States
[00:15.56]out of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
[00:20.32]The two other winners were Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig.
[00:26.72]The Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
[00:30.96]said the three financial experts
[00:33.40]showed "why avoiding bank collapses is vital."
[00:38.28]John Hassler of the prize committee said:
[00:41.60]"Financial crises and depressions
[00:44.76]are kind of the worst thing that can happen to the economy."
[00:49.04]The three men worked during their university careers
[00:52.44]to understand how bank failures
[00:55.08]can cause economic downturns.
[00:57.36]Before their work, most economists
[01:01.04]saw bank failures as a result of
[01:04.32]– but not a cause of – economic problems.
[01:08.56]Research by Diamond and Dybvig in the 1980s
[01:13.88]showed that governments could provide assistance
[01:16.64]to protect money in banks
[01:18.68]and prevent financial crises from getting worse.
[01:22.92]Bernanke did his work at Stanford University
[01:26.32]before serving as chairman of the Federal Reserve
[01:30.16]from 2006 to 2014.
[01:33.92]Diamond worked at the University of Chicago
[01:36.48]and Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis.
[01:41.08]Diamond told the Associated Press
[01:43.84]he was "very happy" and "quite surprised"
[01:47.16]to get the news of his prize win.
[01:50.44]He said it was "gratifying" that the work the economists did
[01:55.72]was easy to understand by government leaders.
[01:59.16]In addition, the proposed policies
[02:03.08]"could be used in the actual financial crisis."
[02:07.64]Diamond added that the current financial system
[02:11.64]is "much less vulnerable"
[02:14.44]because of the work the economists did in the past.
[02:19.80]The university research proved valuable in 2008
[02:25.00]when investors sent the financial system into a panic.
[02:30.52]At the time, Bernanke worked with the U.S. Treasury Department
[02:35.12]to support major banks and ease a shortage of credit.
[02:40.60]He also pushed interest rates on loans lower
[02:44.80]and asked the Federal Reserve to buy problematic investments.
[02:51.36]The actions calmed investors and supported large banks.
[02:57.76]The work from 2008 set an example
[03:01.16]that was used again in 2020
[03:04.24]when the world was in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
[03:08.84]World economies slowed down
[03:12.08]as people were forced to stay home from work.
[03:16.44]At that point, the leader of the Federal Reserve was Jerome Powell.
[03:22.52]Powell cut interest rates and put money into the financial system,
[03:27.64]which started a fast recovery.
[03:31.40]While those actions steadied the economy,
[03:35.08]many nations are still worried about rising costs in food and energy.
[03:42.52]The Nobel committee noted a paper Bernanke wrote at Stanford
[03:47.00]in 1983 about the cause of the Great Depression of the 1930s.
[03:54.76]Allan Blinder, an economics expert at Princeton University,
[03:59.16]told The Associated Press he considered that paper "startlingly original."
[04:06.04]He said it had played an important part
[04:09.68]in explaining how the Great Depression started
[04:12.84]and why it lasted so long.
[04:17.04]Simon Johnson is an economist
[04:20.68]at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
[04:24.56]He said a work by Diamond and Dybvig
[04:28.92]about how governments can support bank
[04:32.80]deposits proposed a "very, very powerful idea."
[04:36.92]In addition, Diamond wrote about how banks
[04:41.20]should play an important part in deciding
[04:44.88]which projects are "worthy" of being financed.
[04:49.56]Monday's award was the last
[04:51.68]in a week of Nobel Prize announcements.
[04:55.00]The winners will share a cash prize
[04:57.68]worth about $900,000
[05:00.76]that will be given out at an event on December 10.
