。
[00:00.04]Schoolchildren in the southern Ukrainian city Zaporizhzhia
[00:06.04]celebrated the traditional first day of school on Sunday.
[00:12.44]The ceremonies began just hours
[00:15.48]after warnings of Russian air raids sounded through the city.
[00:21.76]Zaporizhzhia is just 40 kilometers from the war's front.
[00:28.48]That danger is never far from the minds of teachers
[00:32.84]and families at one of the city's schools.
[00:37.96]Russian artillery and missiles strike there so often
[00:43.16]that local officials were forced to ban large gatherings.
[00:48.92]Only students starting their first
[00:52.64]and last years could take part in the ceremony.
[00:57.12]The Associated Press is not
[01:00.24]identifying the school for security reasons.
[01:04.88]The children wore traditional Ukrainian clothing
[01:08.72]and carried flowers.
[01:11.48]Each first year student
[01:13.44]held the hand of a final year student in a small parade.
[01:19.44]The school once had 800 students
[01:22.72]but about 300 fled the city seeking safer places.
[01:29.04]The remaining children alternate
[01:31.32]one week of study at school
[01:34.00]with one week of online study.
[01:37.60]That is because the school's bomb shelter
[01:41.28]can hold only around 250 people.
[01:46.60]That shelter is about 75 meters away
[01:50.96]from the main school building,
[01:53.00]across an open playground.
[01:56.68]School director Kostiantyn Lypskyi
[02:00.40]said the youngest students work in a classroom
[02:04.44]just above the underground shelter.
[02:07.52]The rest of the school operates in the main building.
[02:13.16]"We prepared everything for the new school year.
[02:16.68]We equipped the bunker in case of air alarms,
[02:20.60]so children will have a safe space
[02:23.80]because our school will continue lessons
[02:27.40]during the air raid alarms in the bunker," he said.
[02:33.08]Sunday's ceremony went on without problems.
[02:37.72]Olha Komarova-Lesko
[02:40.08]is the mother of an 11th grader and a 6th grader.
[02:45.48]She said she was hopeful for the coming school year.
[02:49.68]She sees it as the best solution
[02:53.00]for the present conditions.
[02:56.08]"We are happy that the children
[02:58.40]had the chance to go to the celebration today
[03:01.96]just as in the prewar times," she said,
[03:05.84]"This is really exciting and joyful."
[03:11.00]Russia launched large numbers of missiles
[03:14.08]and drones on the capital Kyiv Monday,
[03:17.84]wounding three people and damaging schools.
[03:21.56]On Tuesday, Russian missiles killed at least 41 people
[03:27.40]and wounded over 180 in Poltova,
[03:31.72]a city in the central eastern part of Ukraine.
