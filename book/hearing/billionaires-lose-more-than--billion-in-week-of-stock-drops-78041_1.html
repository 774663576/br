。
[00:00.00]U.S. stocks suffered their worst losses in years last week.
[00:06.87]Among the biggest losers were the world's top billionaires.
[00:13.60]Financial experts blamed the first major drop last Monday on investor fears
[00:22.49]over possible rising inflation and higher interest rates.
[00:28.31]The Dow regained some ground, but then suffered another drop on Thursday
[00:35.29]after reports of an increasing U.S. government budget deficit.
[00:41.63]The Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as the Dow,
[00:48.06]is a stock market index of 30 large companies based in the U.S.
[00:55.95]The losses followed a long period of gains in U.S. stocks
[01:02.58]when the Dow reached a historic high of 26,616 on January 26.
[01:13.37]In repeated tweets and in his recent State of the Union address,

[01:40.20]At first, Trump remained silent on last Monday's losses.
[01:46.91]But he took to Twitter later on Wednesday to comment.
[01:52.43]"In the ‘old days,' when good news was reported,
[01:57.76]the Stock Market would go up," he wrote.

[02:07.81]Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!"
[02:15.65]Many financial experts have said the big stock drops
[02:21.55]were not that unusual after the recent gains.

[02:47.36]to also have their worst week in years, Reuters news agency reported.
[02:54.47]Asian markets suffered big losses during the week,
[02:59.59]including a four percent drop in Chinese stocks on Friday.
[03:05.07]European stocks also fell, but not as much as markets across Asia.
[03:13.09]Bloomberg reported that recent worldwide sell-offs had removed
[03:19.49]at least $5 trillion from global stocks since January.
[03:25.63]The losses affected the values of companies and the holdings of many American investors.
[03:34.70]The world's billionaires lost a combined $114 billion on Monday alone,
[03:44.36]according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.
[03:48.49]A total of 18 billionaires in the rankings lost more than $1 billion on the day.
