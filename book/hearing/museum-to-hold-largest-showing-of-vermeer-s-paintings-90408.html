。
[00:00.04]The national museum of the Netherlands
[00:03.32]is holding the largest show ever
[00:05.96]of paintings by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer.
[00:09.92]The Rijksmuseum is in the capital, Amsterdam.
[00:14.60]It has placed 28 paintings on exhibit.
[00:18.16]It says they represent about
[00:20.96]half of the 17th century artist's body of work.
[00:25.72]Vermeer is known for his expertise
[00:28.92]at representing light in his paintings.
[00:32.44]His subject was often common household objects.
[00:37.48]The artist worked slowly on his paintings
[00:40.40]and died at the age of 43.
[00:44.08]He likely never saw so many of
[00:46.36]his own works together at one time.
[00:49.44]Rijksmuseum director Taco Dibbits
[00:52.68]said Vermeer had a large family
[00:55.60]and busy life as an art dealer.
[00:58.36]Still, he said, the painter was able
[01:01.84]to create works of quiet beauty.
[01:04.88]"It's this ... complete focus and tranquility in his paintings
[01:09.92]that we still love today," Dibbits said.
[01:13.32]The show includes some of Vermeer's most famous works,
[01:18.08]including Girl With A Pearl Earring (1664) and The Milkmaid (1659).
[01:26.80]Visitors can also see his two known outdoor paintings
[01:31.64]and several others of women playing instruments, reading and working.
[01:37.84]"We're really coming closer to Vermeer than we've ever been,"
[01:41.84]said Pieter Roelofs, the Rijksmuseum's Head of Paintings and Sculpture.
[01:47.04]What is "striking" about Vermeer, Roelofs said,
[01:51.40]"is that in his paintings, it's mostly women who are the protagonists,"
[01:56.76]meaning the main subjects.
[01:58.92]The expert noted that Vermeer had seven daughters.
[02:03.08]Roelofs said Vermeer's works are more than something
[02:07.36]a good eye and skilled hand can create.
[02:11.12]Recent examinations show the Milkmaid was repainted several times.
[02:17.16]Writer Tracy Chevalier attended an event for the show before it opened.
[02:22.96]She wrote the popular book Girl with a Pearl Earring,
[02:27.64]a historical fiction based on the painting.
[02:31.08]It later became a movie.
[02:33.12]Chevalier said the show presents Vermeer as a quiet and private man.
[02:39.24]"His paintings are so quiet and there are no children ...
[02:43.48]he must have compartmentalized his life
[02:46.76]and said 'no, no kids in the studio'."
[02:50.96]Museums in Germany, France, Japan, Britain, Ireland
[02:56.88]and the United States helped with the public showing,
[03:00.92]which opens on Friday and runs until June.
