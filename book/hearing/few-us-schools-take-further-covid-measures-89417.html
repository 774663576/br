<p>As the start of the new school year gets closer, COVID-19 infections in some areas are again on the rise.</p>
<p>Some school systems around the country have moved to hire more workers to limit <strong>disruptions</strong>. But many are hoping for the best without doing things differently compared with last year.</p>

<p>The number of days that Baltimore public schools could not offer in-person learning totaled 116 from January to June of this year. That number comes from the private research firm<a class="wsw__a" href="https://about.burbio.com/school-opening-tracker"> Burbio</a>. It tracks over 5,000 school districts nationwide.</p>
<p>School officials said they did not see a need to take more measures. Charles Herndon is a Baltimore County Public Schools spokesperson. He said he does not think there will be "<strong>significant</strong>" disruptions this coming school year.</p>

<p>Teacher shortages remain a major concern, even bigger than COVID-19 itself, said Dan Domenech. He is the director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association. Superintendents are the leaders of school systems.</p>
<p>"That is the greater concern – that they will have the necessary staff to <strong>man</strong> all the classrooms, to man all the programs," he said.</p>
<p>Philadelphia's schools show how disruptive the virus can be. Beginning in January the virus caused 114 city schools to go online. That resulted in a total of 920 days of online learning, more than any other school system in Burbio's data for January through June.</p>
<p>With shortages of substitute teachers, schools were forced to use central office workers, combine classrooms, or temporarily go online, system spokesperson Marissa Orbanek said.</p>
<p>The district has changed hiring agencies and aims to fill 90 percent of substitute requests this year, said Orbanek. They also now have over 100 extra teachers. They are substitutes who show up at the same school every day in case teachers go absent at the last minute.</p>
<p>Schools cannot afford more disruptions when many kids have fallen behind from the pandemic, said Thomas Kane. He is an education researcher at Harvard University.</p>
<p>Students at schools in poor areas that were doing online learning for more than half a year lost equal to 22 weeks of learning, he said. Schools in wealthy neighborhoods lost only 13 weeks.</p>

<p>Schools are hopeful disruptions will be less likely. Many districts have invested in air flow systems. Vaccines are available to children as young as six months old. Some of the districts that were hit hardest last year have been employing more people and making small changes to their rules.</p>
<p>At Baltimore City schools, which is separate from the county school system, officials say there will be more <strong>access</strong> to rapid COVID tests.</p>
