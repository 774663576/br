。
[00:00.04]South Korean researchers have developed a drone
[00:04.44]designed to stay level when transporting goods
[00:08.84]over many kinds of surfaces.
[00:11.88]A team at Seoul National University
[00:15.16]of Science and Technology
[00:17.60]built a prototype, or test model of the drone.
[00:22.68]The team recently demonstrated the aircraft
[00:26.40]for reporters from Reuters.
[00:29.28]The prototype has a transport carrier
[00:33.44]attached to a drone structure.
[00:36.08]It is supported by several propellers and rotors
[00:40.92]that control its height, speed and direction in the air.
[00:45.92]The aircraft has a handle workers can push
[00:50.08]to guide it where it needs to go.
[00:52.96]Members of the development team showed
[00:56.56]how the drone can keep itself level while floating,
[01:00.64]even when transporting goods up or down stairs.
[01:05.28]Leaders of the research say the drone is programmed
[01:10.36]to predict human actions for effective interactions.
[01:15.80]Lee Seung-jae is a professor of
[01:19.76]mechanical system design engineering
[01:23.32]at Seoul National University of Science and Technology.
[01:28.16]He was a leader of the project.
[01:31.92]The research results appeared in a study
[01:35.52]in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.
[01:40.36]The publication is part of the Institute of Electrical
[01:45.16]and Electronics Engineers, based in New York.
[01:50.16]Lee told Reuters tests of the drone
[01:54.28]showed it could transport objects up to 3 kilograms.
[01:59.60]He admitted this weight restriction
[02:02.56]likely limits the drone's use cases for many businesses.
[02:07.68]But he noted that the transporter's design
[02:11.72]and operating equipment could be used
[02:15.24]to create a series of other kinds of drone vehicles.
[02:19.84]Lee said one example would be to use the transporter
[02:25.04]to carry sensitive or breakable materials.
[02:29.00]The technology could also be used to develop
[02:32.84]"flying taxis" to transport humans, he added.
[02:37.72]When used in a flying taxi,
[02:41.00]Lee said the drones could be used to change batteries
[02:45.44]while still flying in the air, instead of having
[02:49.12]to return to a ground station for recharging.
[02:53.40]In general, experts say drones with multiple propellers
[02:59.24]are easier to control and move in many different settings.
[03:04.32]But they are also slower
[03:06.96]and cannot travel as far on a battery charge.
[03:11.00]Drones with multiple rotors have already been used
[03:15.84]to transport small amounts of goods,
[03:18.76]food and medical supplies.
[03:21.76]But experts say it is difficult
[03:25.12]to widely expand use of such drones
[03:28.72]for commercial purposes.
[03:31.08]This is because such activities
[03:34.40]would require larger batteries
[03:36.68]a smaller aircraft could not support.
