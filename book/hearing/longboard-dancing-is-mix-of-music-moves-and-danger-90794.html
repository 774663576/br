<p>Dooling was one of the first to try longboard dancing. She learned to skate in the northwestern city of Seattle, Washington.

<p>Huang, a native of Melbourne, Australia, started skating during the pandemic. Some days, her board and her dog were the only things that would get her outdoors and moving.</p>

。
[00:00.04]Some American skateboarders
[00:02.92]are creating new moves
[00:05.24]by combining longboarding and dance.
[00:09.28]This version of the activity is already popular
[00:14.00]in southern California.
[00:15.92]It has also become popular in cities
[00:19.64]like Paris, France and Seoul, South Korea.
[00:23.96]Reporters from The Associated Press
[00:27.56]recently spoke with some skaters
[00:30.40]about the unusual activity.
[00:33.00]The AP described it as bringing together skating
[00:38.12]and dance -- with a little danger as well.
[00:42.80]Hannah Dooling told the AP
[00:46.08]she often joins friends in Santa Monica,
[00:49.68]near Los Angeles, where they enjoy
[00:52.56]longboard dancing and doing tricks.
[00:56.08]Longboards started out as a way for surfers
[01:01.00]to keep in shape when they were not in the water.
[01:04.52]They are longer than traditional skateboards.
[01:08.52]The added length can be more difficult to move with,
[01:12.68]but many skaters say
[01:15.00]they can be more graceful on a longboard.
[01:19.72]Today, skaters use longboards
[01:22.84]to make sidewalk turns and bomb hills.
[01:27.04]They also use them for longboard dancing.
[01:30.44]Dooling, who is 30 years old,
[01:33.76]showed off some of her moves during a recent night
[01:37.56]in an empty parking lot in Santa Monica.
[01:41.40]She was joined by her 33-year-old friend
[01:45.28]Yun Huang and Jane Kang and Christie Goodman.
[01:49.84]Kang and Goodman are both 29.
[01:53.72]Everyone in the group wore wide-leg pants
[01:58.16]and flat-bottomed shoes for riding.
[02:01.76]The friends get together most
[02:04.00]Saturday and Sunday afternoons
[02:06.72]if the weather is nice.
[02:08.56]The meetups are supported by the Dancing Foundation.
[02:13.48]The non-profit group started with assistance
[02:17.20]from American technology company Google.
[02:20.64]The organization was started by Achille Brighton,
[02:25.88]a 39-year-old software engineer.
[02:29.40]Longboard dance is still quite young.
[02:33.52]But Brighton told the AP
[02:36.24]it has already spread worldwide –
[02:39.32]from southern California to Paris to Seoul.
[02:43.24]He said those places have public squares
[02:47.00]and a lot of open spaces
[02:49.12]where people can watch the skaters.
[02:51.84]"You don't need skate parks.
[02:54.72]You just need roads," Brighton said.
[02:58.00]"And because you do it in public,
[03:01.04]you're out there, people see it.
[03:03.40]And they're like, ‘Oh, that's kind of cool.'"
[03:06.76]Dooling was one of the first
[03:09.24]to try longboard dancing.
[03:11.56]She learned to skate
[03:13.68]in the northwestern city of Seattle, Washington.
[03:17.48]Now, she works remotely
