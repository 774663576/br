"Do we want our husbands or wives, our children or siblings to work nine to 10 hours a day all year round, or 10 to 12 hours a day for six months?" Nhan said. "We need to answer this question ourselves, before we even discuss overtime."<br/>阮善仁表示，许多工人的上班时间普遍都超过了目前的法定限额。阮善仁表示：“我们是否希望自己的丈夫或妻子，我们的孩子或兄弟姐妹全年每天工作9到10小时，或者半年每天工作10到12小时？我们在讨论加班之前，要先自己回答这个问题。”</p>
<p>Some countries have already taken steps to reduce the number of working hours. For example, Australia bars employers from requiring employees to work more than 38 hours a week.<br/>一些国家已经采取措施减少工作时间。例如，澳大利亚禁止雇主要求员工每周工作超过38小时。</p>
<p>Some European countries have average work weeks far below 40 hours.

。
[00:00.04]Officials in Vietnam are campaigning to reduce the country's legal work week from 48 hours to 40 hours.
[00:12.32]One of the effort's main supporters is Nguyen Thien Nhan.
[00:18.40]He is the secretary of Ho Chi Minh City's Communist Party central committee.
[00:26.04]Nhan and others in the government have argued that making people work longer hours does not increase their productivity.
[00:37.20]Currently, Vietnam has a legal work week of 48 hours.
[00:42.96]This means people are expected to work six days a week, for eight hours a day.
[00:50.24]Nhan says it is common for many workers to spend much longer on the job than the current legal limit.
[00:59.60]"Do we want our husbands or wives, our children or siblings
[01:04.92]to work nine to 10 hours a day all year round, or 10 to 12 hours a day for six months?" Nhan said.
[01:15.88]"We need to answer this question ourselves, before we even discuss overtime."
[01:24.00]Some countries have already taken steps to reduce the number of working hours.
[01:30.52]For example, Australia bars employers from requiring employees to work more than 38 hours a week.
[01:40.08]Some European countries have average work weeks far below 40 hours.
[01:47.24]In Germany, the average worker spends 1,363 hours on the job each year,
[01:55.64]a 2018 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found.
[02:04.20]This equals about 26 hours per week.
[02:09.68]Citizens of Denmark labor a little longer, with an average 1,392 working hours each year.
[02:20.16]Next is Norway, where workers spend 1,416 hours on the job.
[02:29.28]Nhan and his supporters have noted that movements for a 40-hour work week
[02:35.24]date back to a gathering of socialist and labor parties in 1889.
[02:42.60]However, Nhan said the 40-hour work week also became a recognized right among capitalist nations.
[02:53.12]In some countries, companies are taking their own steps to reduce working hours for employees.

[04:14.00]Some are hoping their goal can be reached within 10 years.
[04:19.00]They have pointed out that Vietnam's Communist Party was founded in 1930.
[04:26.04]By the time the party turns 100, in 2030, the nation's workforce could receive a gift: a new 40-hour work week.
