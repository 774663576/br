[00:00.04]Human experts spend years
[00:02.76]roasting and tasting coffee from
[00:05.40]many places to learn about the beans.
[00:09.56]They might then combine a coffee bean
[00:12.12]from Africa with another one from South America
[00:14.60]to come up with a new blend.
[00:17.64]But, a coffee roasting company in Helsinki, Finland
[00:20.84]is hoping that artificial intelligence,
[00:24.04]or AI, can help ease the workload.
[00:28.40]Kaffa Roastery recently launched its "AI-conic" blend
[00:34.28]at the Helsinki Coffee Festival.
[00:37.52]The blend is a mixture of four kinds of beans,
[00:41.04]including Fazenda Pinhal from Brazil.
[00:44.48]It is the result of a joint project
[00:48.16]by Kaffa and Elev, a local AI business.
[00:53.88]Elev told The Associated Press
[00:56.84]that its computer models,
[00:59.12]similar to ChatGPT and Copilot,
[01:02.96]created a blend that would "push the boundaries
[01:06.24]of conventional flavor combinations."
[01:09.80]Svante Hampf is the founder of Kaffa Roastery.
[01:13.56]He and his partners wanted to do an experiment
[01:16.92]to see what blend the computer would produce.
[01:20.80]"We basically gave descriptions
[01:23.08]of all our coffee types and their flavors to AI
[01:27.04]and instructed it to create a new exciting blend," Hampf said.
[01:32.76]The "AI-conic" blend combined beans from Brazil,
[01:37.00]Colombia, Ethiopia and Guatemala.
[01:39.96]It is described as "a well-balanced blend
[01:42.96]of sweetness and ripe fruit."
[01:46.20]Hampf said he thought the combination was "somewhat weird."
[01:50.56]He was surprised that the AI program chose
[01:54.16]to make the blend out of four different kinds of beans.
[01:58.60]Most humans choose only two or three beans.
[02:02.52]However, after the first blind test of the new blend,
[02:07.72]Kaffa's coffee experts agreed
[02:10.12]that the AI-assisted blend was perfect.
[02:13.00]There was no need to change.
[02:16.44]Elev's Antti Merilehto said "AI-conic" is an example of

[02:23.76]to seasoned professionals."
