。
[00:00.04]New research shows that water temperatures
[00:04.52]in and around Australia's Great Barrier Reef
[00:08.80]have risen to their warmest in 400 years
[00:12.44]over the past 10 years.
[00:16.16]The rising temperatures
[00:17.96]have put the world's largest reef under threat.
[00:23.84]The Great Barrier Reef is the world's
[00:26.96]largest living ecosystem.
[00:30.88]It stretches for 2,400 kilometers
[00:35.20]off the coast of the northern state of Queensland.
[00:41.60]A group of scientists at universities across Australia
[00:46.76]removed core samples from the coral.
[00:50.84]They examined the samples to measure
[00:53.96]summer ocean temperatures
[00:56.44]going back to the year 1618.
[01:01.64]The scientists combined information
[01:04.64]from core samples with ship and satellite data
[01:10.16]going back around 100 years.
[01:15.00]The results show that ocean temperatures
[01:18.64]were unchanged for hundreds of years.
[01:22.52]But starting in 1900,
[01:25.44]the ocean temperatures began to rise.
[01:30.40]The research found that this is the result
[01:33.44]of human influence.
[01:37.76]From 1960 to 2024,
[01:41.88]the study's writers observed
[01:44.24]an average yearly warming for January to March
[01:48.96]of 0.12 degrees Celsius per decade.
[01:55.08]Since 2016, the reef has experienced
[01:59.36]five summers of mass coral bleaching.
[02:04.36]This is when large parts of the reef
[02:07.64]turn white due to heat stress.
[02:12.28]This also puts the coral
[02:14.52]at greater risk of death.
[02:18.24]The mass bleaching events
[02:20.48]happened during five of the six warmest years
[02:25.68]in the last four centuries, the study showed.
[02:30.96]This research appeared on August 8
[02:34.40]in the publication Nature.
[02:38.24]"The world is losing one of its icons,"
[02:42.40]said Benjamin Henley.
[02:45.08]He is with the University of Melbourne
[02:48.44]and is one of the study's co-writers.
[02:52.60]"I find that to be an absolute tragedy.
[02:56.36]It's hard to understand how that can happen
[03:00.12]on our watch in our lifetime.
[03:03.76]So it's very sad," Henley added.
[03:08.32]The last temperature measurement,
[03:10.52]from January to March of this year,
[03:13.80]was the highest on record.
[03:16.96]Henley added that it was "head and shoulders"
[03:20.76]above any other year,
[03:23.12]meaning it was much higher.
[03:27.20]Coral reefs are important for many reasons.
[03:31.12]They protect shorelines from erosion.
[03:35.96]They are home to thousands of kinds of fish.
[03:39.60]And they are an important part
[03:43.12]of the tourism industry in many countries.
[03:48.00]In Australia, the Great Barrier Reef
[03:51.16]adds $4.2 billion to the economy each year.
[03:57.72]At least 54 countries and areas
[04:01.76]have experienced mass bleaching of their reefs
[04:05.72]since February 2023,
[04:09.16]as climate change warms the ocean's surface waters.
[04:15.08]That information comes
[04:16.96]from the U.S. National Oceanic
[04:20.28]and Atmospheric Administration.
