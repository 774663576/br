<p>Across the U.S., there are many students like Angel Hope.</p>
<p>Hope <strong>graduated </strong>near the top of his high school class. But on a test — a University of Wisconsin exam that measures what new students learned in high school — all he could do was<strong> guess</strong>.

<p>Hundreds of thousands of recent graduates are going to college this autumn after spending more than half their high school years dealing with the pandemic.

<p>Allison Wagner is head of All-In Milwaukee - a program that provides financial aid and other assistance to poor students, including Hope.</p>
<p>Wagner saw many students work part-time jobs in their last year of high school. She saw more students than ever who did not take math or science classes because of teacher shortages. "There is no way they are going to be <strong>academically</strong> prepared for ... college," she said.</p>
<p>Her group is spending more money to help students with summer classes in math or science. Still, she feels the <strong>setbacks</strong> will force some students to take more than four years to graduate or, worse, drop out.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge programs </strong></p>
<p>Researchers say that online learning was difficult for students. For younger students, there is still hope that America's schools can close learning gaps. But for those who graduated in the last two years, experts fear many will struggle.</p>
<p>Colleges from New Jersey to California have been expanding "bridge" programs. These programs provide summer classes, often for students from poor families or those who are the first in their families to attend college.</p>

[00:00.04]American colleges could see an increase

[00:07.68]of college-level work, education experts say.
[00:11.80]Unprepared students have a higher risk of dropping out
