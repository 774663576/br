。
[00:00.04]Argentina has welcomed a United Nations decision
[00:05.20]to include a former secret detention
[00:09.36]and torture center as a World Heritage site.
[00:15.44]A UN Educational, Scientific
[00:18.88]and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conference
[00:22.52]in Saudi Arabia agreed this week
[00:26.40]to include the ESMA Museum and Site of Memory
[00:31.52]on its list of places "considered to be
[00:35.60]of outstanding value to humanity."
[00:40.48]The former Navy School of Mechanics, known as ESMA,
[00:45.92]is in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires.
[00:51.16]It contained the most infamous illegal detention center
[00:56.32]that operated during Argentina's last dictatorship ---
[01:00.80]from 1976 through 1983.
[01:07.08]It now operates as a museum
[01:10.28]and a larger site of memory,
[01:13.00]including offices for government agencies
[01:17.36]and human rights organizations.
[01:21.48]Argentina's President Alberto Fernández
[01:25.16]praised UNESCO's decision in a video message.
[01:29.76]The memory must be kept alive, he said,
[01:33.28]"so that no one in Argentina forgets or denies
[01:38.32]the horrors that were experienced there."
[01:42.44]Fernández later said to the United Nations
[01:45.72]General Assembly in New York on Tuesday afternoon:
[01:50.44]"By actively preserving the memory
[01:53.92]that denialists want to conceal,
[01:56.56]we will prevent that pain from recurring."
[02:01.16]It is estimated that some 5,000 people
[02:05.28]were detained at the ESMA during the dictatorship.
[02:10.44]Many detainees were tortured and later disappeared.
[02:15.92]It also housed many who were later
[02:19.24]thrown into the ocean or rivers
[02:22.28]from planes known as "death flights."
[02:26.76]The ESMA also housed pregnant women
[02:30.40]brought from other illegal detention centers.
[02:35.16]They were kept there until they gave birth
[02:38.56]and their babies were later taken away by military officers.
[02:45.08]Argentina's Human Rights Secretary Horacio Pietragalla Corti
[02:51.36]praised the decision to recognize the site.
[02:56.28]He said it is a strong answer "to those who deny
[03:01.16]or seek to downplay state terrorism
[03:04.84]and the crimes of the last civil-military dictatorship."
[03:11.68]A video posted on social media
[03:14.60]by Argentina's Foreign Ministry
[03:17.36]showed the official with tears in his eyes
[03:20.96]as he celebrated the UNESCO decision.
[03:25.44]Pietragalla was one of the babies taken by military officers
[03:30.88]and raised under a false identity.
[03:35.20]The group Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo
[03:38.60]discovered his birth history, as well as those
[03:42.64]of 132 other stolen babies through genetic testing.
[03:49.52]Argentina has done more than any other Latin American country
[03:55.00]to bring crimes of former dictatorships to trial.
[04:00.04]It has held almost 300 trials,
[04:03.76]all linked to crimes against humanity, since 2006.
[04:09.72]The ESMA's addition to the World Heritage list
[04:13.96]speaks to more than just Argentina.
[04:18.04]Pietragalla called the recognition
[04:20.84]"a tribute to the thousands
[04:23.44]of disappeared individuals in our continent."
