[01:09.44]What we feared has come to pass.
[01:12.36]Our country has been struck by attacks

[01:19.88]In a statement, French President Francois Hollande said,
[01:24.92]"Through the attacks in Brussels, the whole of Europe has been hit."
[01:30.40]The French prime minister added,
[01:33.00]"We are at war. We have been subjected
[01:36.40]for the last few months in Europe to acts of war."
[01:40.74]In Havana, Cuba, President Barack Obama said,
[01:45.52]"We will do whatever is necessary to support our friend
[01:49.72]and ally Belgium in bringing to justice those who are responsible.
[01:55.24]And this is yet another reminder
[01:57.68]that the world must unite regardless of nationality or race or faith

[02:44.64]and that the third — dressed in a light-colored coat,
[02:48.72]black hat and glasses — was at large.
[02:52.72]Police later found a nail-filled bomb,
[02:56.76]chemical products and an Islamic State flag
[03:00.88]while searching a house in the Schaerbeek neighborhood.
[03:04.76]The attacks happened just days after the arrest of Salah Abdeslam in Brussels.
[03:11.52]He is accused of being one of the leaders
[03:14.28]of the deadly Paris terrorist attacks in November.
[03:18.47]Some experts feared that his supporters
[03:22.00]would answer his arrest with attacks in Brussels.
