。
[00:00.04]About 26.5 million jobless Americans have asked the government
[00:06.36]for financial assistance over the last five weeks.
[00:11.20]The number confirms that all the job gains in the United States
[00:16.96]over the past 10 years have been lost during the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:24.40]The rising levels of unemployment provide evidence for economists' claims
[00:30.60]that the U.S. economy entered recession in March.
[00:36.20]They also point to a collapse in retail and home sales,
[00:41.28]manufacturing production and homebuilding.
[00:47.08]As the economic slowdown deepens, some Americans are protesting nationwide measures
[00:54.56]to control the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
[01:02.44]President Donald Trump is worried and wants to restart the economy as soon as possible.
[01:11.32]He is seeking a second term in elections later this year.
[01:17.44]On Wednesday, Trump praised decisions made by some states to begin reopening their economies.
[01:27.28]Those states are governed by members of his Republican Party.
[01:33.32]U.S. health experts have warned of a possible increase in infections
[01:38.80]if areas reopen before the disease is under control.
[01:45.32]The labor market is pushing into "new territory," notes Daniel Zhao,
[01:50.68]an economist with Glassdoor, a company that helps jobseekers.
[01:57.80]He added that the unemployment rate is already greater than the during the Great Recession .
[02:05.88]The federal government reported Thursday that in the week ending April 18,
[02:11.60]more than 4.4 million unemployed Americans sought benefits from the government.
[02:19.12]Since March 21, over 26 million people have asked for government assistance.
[02:26.76]That represents 16.2 percent of the work force.
[02:33.36]The U.S. economy created 22 million jobs between September 2010 and February 2020.
[02:42.68]That represents the longest increase in job growth in U.S. history.
[02:50.40]The Labor Department said the high numbers of unemployed were because of "the COVID-19 virus."
[03:00.00]Economists are saying as many as 25 million jobs were lost in April,
[03:07.36]which was the largest decrease in 11 years.
[03:12.92]Although the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits is high, it is decreasing.
[03:21.80]The number appeared to have reached a peak -- a record 6.867 million -- in the week ending March 28.
[03:33.00]Job losses are likely "to continue across a number of industries in coming weeks,
[03:40.16]said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York.
[03:46.84]The decrease in unemployment claims is partly a result of congressional legislation.
[03:54.32]Under a $2.3 trillion program, small businesses are offered loans
[04:00.80]that could be partially forgiven if they are used to pay their workers.
[04:06.92]The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved $484 billion in additional aid.
[04:14.68]If it becomes law, the measure would mostly expand loans for small businesses.
[04:23.92]The government aid is designed to prevent additional unemployment.
[04:30.32]Economists will continue to study the number of Americans who asked the government for jobless benefits.
[04:38.72]This number is considered a truer picture of total unemployment nationwide.
[04:47.00]In the week ending April 11, the number was nearly 16 million.
[04:54.36]Economists believe the unemployment rate this month will be the highest since the end of World War II.
[05:03.24]The old record -- of 10.8 percent – was set in November 1982.
[05:11.52]The April totals will not, however, come near the 25 percent unemployment rate in 1933 during the Great Depression.
