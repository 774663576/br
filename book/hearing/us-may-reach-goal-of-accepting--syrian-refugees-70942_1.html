。
[00:00.00]The United States is working to reach its goal
[00:04.38]of bringing 10,000 Syrian refugees to the country by the end of September.
[00:10.78]There has been an increase in the number of Syrian refugees
[00:15.59]entering the U.S. in the past three months.
[00:19.56]More than 8,000 people who fled violence and persecution in Syria
[00:27.08]have been resettled in the United States between October 1, 2015 and this week.
[00:35.18]The State Department's Refugee Processing Center
[00:39.70]says half are under the age of 14.
[00:43.85]A few hundred Syrian refugees have entered the U.S. every month since last September.
[00:52.87]U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced a plan to welcome them.
[00:59.53]Experts had said it would be difficult to reach the goal
[01:05.04]of bringing 10,000 Syrian refugees to the U.S. by the end of September.
[01:11.75]The previous year, 1,682 Syrian refugees entered the country.
[01:20.69]But in February, the State Department created a center in Amman, Jordan
[01:27.09]to help refugees apply to enter the U.S.
[01:31.11]The application, interviews and medical and security investigations necessary
[01:39.55]before refugees can be accepted usually take 18 to 24 months.
[01:46.84]But American officials said having the new center would reduce that time to three months.
[01:55.77]In May, 1,069 Syrian refugees entered the United States.
[02:04.18]More than 2,000 entered in both June and July.
[02:09.77]The 8,000 Syrian refugees who have entered so far have been sent to 38 states.
[02:19.85]Michigan has the most -- 887. California received 783,
[02:29.21]Arizona 651, Texas 565 and Pennsylvania 481.
[02:40.94]More refugees have been resettled in the United States than any other country.
[02:48.67]Almost 61,000 refugees have entered the U.S. since last October.
[02:56.74]Last year, Kerry also announced that the government
[03:02.59]would increase the number of refugees permitted into the U.S. from 70,000 to 85,000.
[03:12.23]The number is set by the president after he or she receives advice from the State Department.
[03:21.82]It will increase to 100,000 in the coming year.
[03:27.54]But many more Syrians want to enter the United States.
[03:32.97]The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates
[03:38.69]4.8 million Syrians have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq.
[03:49.35]The office says 6.6 million have been displaced within Syria.
[03:56.61]The Syrian civil war began in 2011.
[04:01.47]At that time, the U.S. was accepting only a few Syrian refugees every year.
[04:09.49]Millions of Syrians fleeing conflict and Islamic State violence across the country
[04:17.43]have been accepted by Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.
[04:22.34]Many Republican governors have criticized the Obama administration's decision
[04:29.92]to accept more Syrian refugees.
[04:33.81]Several state legislatures have considered bills to slow
[04:39.92]or stop the resettlement of some or all refugees in their states.
[04:47.42]Some opponents of the refugee resettlement plan say they do not believe
[04:54.32]the security investigations of the refugees have been complete enough.
[05:00.22]The administration has said they are.
[05:03.77]In early July, an Associated Press-GfK public opinion survey found
[05:13.60]that 69 percent of Republicans support a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.
[05:21.43]Fifty-two percent of Americans opposed such a ban; 45 percent supported it.

[05:34.70]to discuss refugee and migrant issues.
[05:39.40]Almost one million Syrians are seeking asylum in Europe.
