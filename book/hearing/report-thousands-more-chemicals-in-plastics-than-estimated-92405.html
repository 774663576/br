。
[00:00.04]A recently released report
[00:02.96]from European scientists
[00:06.40]says there are 16,000 chemicals
[00:10.36]in plastic materials around the world.
[00:15.56]The report said not enough is known
[00:18.96]about the safety of all those chemicals.
[00:24.24]They estimate that about 25 percent
[00:28.36]of these chemicals are possibly harmful
[00:32.36]to human health or the environment.
[00:36.60]The Norwegian Research Council
[00:39.44]supported the creation of the report.
[00:44.04]It was released as officials are negotiating
[00:48.52]a United Nations treaty on plastic pollution.
[00:53.96]The U.N. estimates 400 million metric tons
[00:58.32]of plastic waste are produced every year.
[01:03.32]Jane Muncke helped write the report.
[01:07.12]She is with the Swiss nonprofit
[01:11.04]Food Packaging Forum.
[01:14.04]She said to deal with plastic pollution,
[01:17.68]people must look at the "full life cycle of plastics."
[01:23.84]Researchers fear chemicals from plastics
[01:27.84]can spread into water and food.
[01:31.68]Muncke said, "We're finding hundreds,
[01:35.32]if not thousands, of plastic chemicals in people now
[01:40.40]and some of them have been linked
[01:43.04]to adverse health outcomes."
[01:46.64]Activists say such effects
[01:49.48]include possible harm
[01:52.00]to the reproductive system
[01:54.44]and cardiovascular disease.
[01:58.56]Martin Wagner is the lead writer of the study.
[02:03.76]He is an environmental scientist
[02:06.96]at the Norwegian University
[02:09.80]of Science and Technology.
[02:13.44]He said researchers find hundreds,
[02:16.64]if not thousands, of chemicals
[02:19.52]in everyday products when they look for them.
[02:24.04]Kimberly Wise White
[02:26.36]is with the American Chemistry Council,
[02:30.36]an industry group.
[02:33.24]She said the findings "ignore real-world exposures."
[02:38.92]She added the findings "paint an incomplete picture"
[02:43.68]for policy makers and the public.
[02:48.12]The plastics industry has said any worldwide treaty
[02:53.24]should support recycling and re-use of plastic.
[02:58.84]But the writers of the recent report
[03:02.04]said that only dealing with plastic waste
[03:05.88]does not go far enough.
[03:09.04]They said there is a need for more information
[03:12.88]on chemicals in plastics, including recycled products.
[03:19.60]About 25 percent of the chemicals found
[03:24.04]lacked information on their chemical identity,
[03:28.24]the report said.
[03:30.84]Wagner said the problem
[03:33.16]"is the chemical complexity of plastics."
[03:38.12]He is a leading member of the Scientists'
[03:41.80]Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty.
[03:47.40]It is an organization of scientists and experts
[03:52.56]seeking to advise the plastics treaty process.
[03:57.72]Wagner said, "Often producers don't really know
[04:02.56]which kind of chemicals they have in their products
[04:06.84]and that comes from very complex value chains."
[04:12.16]Six percent of the chemicals found in plastics
[04:16.52]are regulated internationally.
[04:20.24]Wagner said that without regulations,
[04:23.96]there is no reason for companies
[04:26.56]to identify what is in the plastics.
[04:30.96]Last year, the United Nations
[04:33.88]Environment Program (UNEP)
[04:37.48]said there were around 13,000 chemicals in plastics.
[04:43.80]Negotiations will continue in Ottawa, Canada.
[04:48.92]The aim is to finish a version of a treaty
[04:52.72]by December in the South Korean city of Busan.
