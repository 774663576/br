[00:00.04]Andrea Riseborough is a respected actress from Britain,
[00:03.72]but she is not especially famous.
[00:06.80]She was recently nominated for an Academy Award, or Oscar,
[00:12.68]for her work in a movie called To Leslie.
[00:16.36]Many people wondered how she received
[00:19.60]the nomination over other actresses.
[00:22.32]To Leslie only sold $27,000 worth of tickets
[00:27.92]when it came out in 2022.
[00:31.84]It turns out that Riseborough has many famous friends
[00:35.76]who campaigned for her.
[00:38.00]Famous actors including Kate Winslet,
[00:41.04]Jennifer Aniston and Gwyneth Paltrow
[00:43.80]put on events where they showed Riseborough's film.
[00:48.32]The director of To Leslie called Academy Award voters
[00:51.96]to ask them to support his film.
[00:55.68]Other famous actors made posts
[00:57.96]on social media supporting the movie.
[01:01.96]People who follow the Academy Awards wondered
[01:05.48]if that kind of campaigning was permitted.
[01:09.40]Bill Kramer is the leader of the organization that gives the awards.
[01:14.72]He said the group investigated Riseborough's campaign
[01:19.16]and decided the nomination should not be taken away.
[01:25.00]"However," he said, "we did discover some social media
[01:29.60]and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern."
[01:35.68]Kramer is having discussions
[01:37.64]about the campaigning methods with the people behind them.
[01:42.52]Movie studios promote the movies
[01:45.12]they think should be considered for the Oscars
[01:48.52]for many months ahead of voting.
[01:51.44]But Kramer said the direct communication
[01:55.04]with voters was concerning.
[01:59.44]He said parts of the campaigning rules "must be clarified"
[02:04.20]and the changes will come after this year's awards.
[02:08.52]The awards ceremony is on March 12.
[02:13.60]Critics said the direct communication with voters
[02:17.72]is evidence that it is more helpful
[02:21.04]to be friends with powerful people
[02:23.84]than to give a possibly winning performance.
[02:29.92]Some critics believed that two Black actresses
[02:34.12]– Viola Davis of The Woman King
[02:36.80]and Danielle Deadwyler of Till
[02:40.20]– should have gotten nominations over Riseborough.
[02:44.20]Along with Riseborough,
[02:46.00]the nominees for Best Actress are Cate Blanchett for Tar,
[02:51.00]Michelle Williams for The Fablemans,
[02:55.24]Ana de Armas for Blonde,
