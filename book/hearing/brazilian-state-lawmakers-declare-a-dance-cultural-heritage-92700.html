<p>"Passinho in my life is the basis of everything I have," dancer and <strong>choreographer</strong> Walcir de Oliveira told the Associated Press.

<p>Ludemir describes the style as an expression of Brazilian culture, called "<strong>cannibalism</strong>." That is the idea of taking elements from other cultures to produce something new. He said the passinho is a dance that takes elements "from all dances. It's a crossing of the cultural influences <strong>absorbed</strong> by kids...as they were connecting with the world through social media in internet cafes."</p>
<p>Supporters say dancing also became a way for young people from the favelas to avoid becoming criminals. Rio state legislator Veronica Lima proposed the law honoring the passinho. In a statement, Lima said it was important to help "decriminalize funk and artistic expressions of youths" from the favelas.</p>
<p>Ludemir said the declaration honors the first generation of passinho dancers as examples for favela youths.</p>
<p>Among them is Pablo Henrique Goncalves. He won a passinho battle back in 2014 and created a boy group called OZCrias. The group has four dancers from Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro's largest favela. The group earns money performing.</p>
<p>Another dance group is Passinho Carioca in the Penha favelas on the other side of the city. One of its leaders, Nayara Costa, said she came from a family where everyone was involved in selling drugs. She said Passinho saved her from that life.

<p>"Today I give classes to people who are in their sixties; passinho is for everyone," said Costa, who is 23. "Passinho, in the same way that it changed my life, is still going to change the lives of others."</p>
