<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:US Move to Raise Interest Rates Could Have a Big Effect]

。
[00:00.00]The United States central bank raised its main interest rate Wednesday
[00:06.76]for the third time this year.
[00:10.47]The rate increase could affect not only the U.S. economy,
[00:16.01]but economies around the world.
[00:19.59]Experts say the move could mark the end of
[00:24.37]what has been called the central bank's "accommodative" policy.
[00:29.83]That monetary policy was put in place
[00:33.80]after the international financial crisis 10 years ago.
[00:39.78]With it, bank officials sought to fuel economic growth
[00:45.42]through low interest rates and big loans.
[00:49.52]On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
[00:53.94]raised its federal funds rate to between two and 2.25 percent.
[01:02.77]Big, private banks pay this rate for short-term loans
[01:08.28]from the Federal Reserve, but it affects many other kinds of loans.
[01:15.38]Observers note that almost all important measures of the U.S. economy are strong.
[01:22.78]From April to June, the economy grew at a faster-than-expected rate of 4.2 percent.
[01:31.74]Nationwide, unemployment remains near a record low of 3.9 percent.
[01:40.07]And consumer confidence measures, which show Americans' willingness to spend,
[01:47.31]have reached their highest level in 18 years.
[01:52.01]Low unemployment means the country
[01:55.67]has a shortage of workers and pay is likely to increase.
[02:01.86]The Associated Press reports that Federal Reserve policymakers
[02:08.70]believe wages will increase in the coming months.
[02:12.85]That will put pressure on the group that controls the U.S. monetary policy,
[02:18.76]the Open Market Committee.
[02:21.32]The committee might feel pressure to raise interest rates
[02:26.10]to reduce the risk of high inflation.
[02:29.57]Raising interest rates makes borrowing more costly.
[02:34.07]This usually slows economic growth.
[02:37.62]But it can also increase the value of U.S. money on foreign exchange markets.
[02:43.97]The strength of the American economy has already caused
[02:49.09]the value of the U.S. dollar to rise in other areas.
[02:53.94]That could hurt countries like Turkey.
[02:56.56]This month, the Turkish central bank increased its main interest rate
[03:03.11]by more than six percent in an effort to stop the fall
[03:07.40]in value of Turkey's currency, the lira.
[03:11.11]But the lira has lost nearly 40 percent of its exchange value against the dollar this year.
[03:19.62]Argentina, South Africa and Indonesia are just some of the other countries
[03:25.66]facing big drops in their currencies.
[03:29.94]Adding to these concerns is the trade dispute between the United States and China.
[03:36.47]On Monday, the U.S. government enacted import tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods.
[03:44.52]China has answered by announcing new taxes on $60 billion in American goods.
[03:52.62]Trade talks set for October have been cancelled.
[03:57.50]Officials at the Asian Development Bank, based in Manilla,
[04:02.07]do not believe the trade dispute will affect growth in East Asia this year.
[04:08.13]But the bank predicts growth will fall from 6 percent to 5.8 percent in 2019.
[04:16.88]The bank also predicts that the trade dispute
[04:20.98]could reduce China's economic growth by .5 percent and U.S. growth by .1 percent.
