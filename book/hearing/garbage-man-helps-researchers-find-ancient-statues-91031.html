[00:00.04]A major discovery of ancient art in Italy
[00:04.76]will go on show this month in the capital, Rome.
[00:10.44]Researchers found the more than 2000-year-old Etruscan
[00:15.40]and Roman statues in the area of Tuscany.
[00:20.00]Italy is opening the works to public view
[00:23.80]at the city's Quirinale Palace starting on June 22.
[00:29.80]A retired garbage man helped in the discovery of the statues,
[00:35.24]which lay in mud at the ruins of an ancient spa.
[00:40.00]Italian scientists announced the find in November.
[00:44.88]Experts called it the biggest collection
[00:48.32]of ancient bronze statues ever found in Italy.
[00:53.64]Some said it was a major finding that would "rewrite history."
[00:59.08]Researchers found the statues in 2021 and 2022
[01:05.80]in the village of San Casciano dei Bagni.
[01:10.40]The village still has public baths in operation today.
[01:14.92]Researchers had long suspected ancient ruins could be discovered at the site.
[01:22.00]The first few attempts to locate the ancient baths,
[01:25.88]however, were unsuccessful.
[01:28.60]Then former garbage man and amateur local historian
[01:33.56]Stefano Petrini had an idea.
[01:36.72]He remembered that years earlier
[01:40.04]he had seen bits of ancient Roman columns
[01:43.72]on a wall on the other side of the public baths.
[01:47.80]When Petrini took researchers to the place,
[01:51.72]they knew they had found the right spot.
[01:55.32]"It all started from there, from the columns," Petrini said.
[01:59.92]Emanuele Mariotti is head of the San Casciano archaeological project.
[02:07.20]He said his team had been getting "quite desperate" for evidence
[02:11.72]when Petrini's information came through.
[02:14.80]They discovered a shrine at the center of the ancient spa complex.
[02:20.20]The statues found there were offerings from Romans and Etruscans
[02:26.04]who looked to the gods for good health.
[02:28.96]One of the most amazing finds was the so-called "scrawny boy,"
[02:34.20]a statue about 90 centimeters high,
[02:37.60]of a young Roman with a bone disease.
[02:41.44]A small piece of writing has his name as "Marcius Grabillo."
[02:46.60]Italian culture ministry archaeologist Ada Salvi
[02:51.20]said the muddy statue looked like the representation of an athlete.
[02:57.40]But, the expert saw it differently
[03:00.40]after the piece had been completely cleaned.
[03:03.84]"...It was clear that it was that of a sick person," Salvi said.
[03:09.00]More unusual offerings were also among smaller objects in the discovery.
[03:15.48]These include egg shells, pine cones,
[03:18.84]medical tools and a 2,000-year-old piece of hair.
[03:24.84]"There's a whole world of meaning that has to be understood
[03:29.00]and studied," Salvi said of the finds.
[03:32.88]Workers permanently closed the spa about 1600 years ago.
[03:38.60]The warm mud of the baths protected the statues.
[03:42.84]Digging will begin again in late June.
[03:46.64]Mariotti said more ancient objects are sure to be found in the coming years.
[03:52.92]The experts say they may find another six or 12 statues
[03:58.32]noted in a document found at the site.

[04:12.68]After the Rome showing, the statues and other objects
[04:17.36]are expected to be given a home at a new site back in San Casciano.
[04:22.88]Retiree Petrini hopes the treasures will bring "jobs,

[04:30.92]which is struggling with depopulation like much of rural Italy.
[04:37.12]But he does not want to take credit for the discovery.
