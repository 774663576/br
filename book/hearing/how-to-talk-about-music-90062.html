<p>Imagine that you hear music on the radio or on your phone. Maybe you like the sounds; maybe you do not.</p>
<p>But how should you describe the music? What kinds of terms and structures should you use in a discussion?</p>
<p>In today's Everyday Grammar, we will explore how you can talk about music. You will learn about sentence patterns, adjectives, and adjectival prepositional <strong>phrases</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/03370000-0aff-0242-dfce-08dad39e1d99_cx2_cy1_cw97_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"></span></div>
<p>Let's start with some important terms and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Sentence patterns, adjectives</strong></p>
<p>Sentences often fall into patterns – usual, repeated structures. One of the structures commonly used to describe music is as follows:</p>
<p><em>Subject – linking verb – adjective (or subject complement)</em></p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<p><em>The music sounds nice.</em></p>
<p>The subject is "the music," the linking verb is "sounds," and the adjective is "nice."</p>
<p>The adjective is sometimes called the subject complement, meaning it completes the verb and <strong>modifies</strong> or describes the subject.</p>
<p>Common linking verbs used to describe music include "be" and "sound."</p>
<p>For example, a person might say:</p>
<p><em>This music is wild!</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>This music is boring.</em></p>
<p>In both cases, adjectives such as "wild" or "boring" play an important part in the sentence. They describe how the speaker feels about the music. Some adjectives have a negative meaning. Boring means uninteresting, tiresome. If a person says that the music is boring, they are suggesting that they do not like the music.</p>
<p>Other common adjectives used to describe music include loud, soft, smooth, harsh, fast, and slow.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong></p>
<p>We can also describe the effects that music has on us. In this case, we can use adjectives such as "relaxing," "calming," "exciting," "moving," or "<strong>touching</strong>."</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><em>This music is relaxing.</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>This song is very touching.</em></p>
<p><strong>Phrases</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes English speakers replace an adjective with a kind of phrase known as an adjectival prepositional phrase. These phrases – sometimes <strong>idiomatic </strong>expressions – name or describe something about the subject.</p>
<p>For example, you might say:</p>
<p><em>The violin sounds out of tune.</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>The singer is out of his mind.</em></p>
<p>The former example – the one about the violin - uses the phrase "out of tune," meaning not having the correct pitch or intonation.</p>
<p>The latter example – the one about the singer – uses the phrase "out of his mind," meaning that the singer has lost control of his mind or went insane.</p>
<p><strong>Practice</strong></p>
<p>Let's take some time to work with these ideas.</p>
<p>Choose a linking verb to connect the noun "song" and the adjective "smooth."</p>
<p>Pause the audio to consider your answer.</p>
<p>Here is one possible answer:</p>
<p><em>This song is smooth.</em></p>
<p>Now describe a singer's voice by using the expression "out of this world," meaning extremely impressive or enjoyable.</p>
<p>Pause the audio to consider your answer.</p>
<p>Here are two possible answers:</p>
<p><em>Her voice is out of this world!</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>His voice is out of this world!</em></p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>
<p>The next time you listen to music, ask yourself the following questions: How would you use what you have learned today to describe the music you are listening to?</p>
<p>Are there other words or structures that you should use to describe the music?</p>
<p>Asking yourself these kinds of questions can improve more than just your English skill. These questions could also deepen your enjoyment of the music itself.</p>

。
[00:00.04]Imagine that you hear music on the radio or on your phone.
[00:05.12]Maybe you like the sounds; maybe you do not.
[00:09.56]But how should you describe the music?
[00:12.84]What kinds of terms and structures
[00:15.32]should you use in a discussion?
[00:17.84]In today's Everyday Grammar,
[00:20.44]we will explore how you can talk about music.
[00:23.88]You will learn about sentence patterns, adjectives,
[00:28.24]and adjectival prepositional phrases.
[00:31.84]Let's start with some important terms and ideas.
[00:37.12]Sentences often fall into patterns
[00:40.64]– usual, repeated structures.
[00:43.44]One of the structures commonly used
[00:46.64]to describe music is as follows:
[00:50.44]Subject – linking verb – adjective (or subject complement)
[00:56.48]Consider this example:
[00:59.64]The music sounds nice.
[01:02.00]The subject is "the music,"
[01:04.96]the linking verb is "sounds,"
[01:08.16]and the adjective is "nice."
[01:11.68]The adjective is sometimes called the subject complement,
[01:15.80]meaning it completes the verb
[01:18.00]and modifies or describes the subject.
[01:21.52]Common linking verbs used to describe music
[01:25.80]include "be" and "sound."
[01:29.20]For example, a person might say:
[01:33.00]This music is wild!
[01:34.92]Or
[01:36.44]This music is boring.
[01:39.24]In both cases, adjectives such as "wild" or "boring"
[01:44.12]play an important part in the sentence.
[01:47.24]They describe how the speaker feels about the music.
[01:51.60]Some adjectives have a negative meaning.
[01:55.44]Boring means uninteresting, tiresome.
[01:58.72]If a person says that the music is boring,
[02:02.44]they are suggesting that they do not like the music.
[02:06.04]Other common adjectives used to describe music
[02:10.20]include loud, soft, smooth, harsh, fast, and slow.
[02:19.20]We can also describe the effects that music has on us.
[02:23.96]In this case, we can use adjectives such as "relaxing,"
[02:29.00]"calming," "exciting," "moving," or "touching."
[02:34.72]For example:
[02:36.48]This music is relaxing.
[02:38.88]Or
[02:40.32]This song is very touching.
[02:42.72]Sometimes English speakers replace an adjective
[02:46.56]with a kind of phrase known as an adjectival prepositional phrase.
[02:51.60]These phrases – sometimes idiomatic expressions
[02:55.64]– name or describe something about the subject.
[02:59.16]For example, you might say:
[03:02.08]The violin sounds out of tune.
[03:05.48]Or
[03:07.12]The singer is out of his mind.
[03:10.80]The former example – the one about the violin
[03:14.52]- uses the phrase "out of tune,"
[03:17.24]meaning not having the correct pitch or intonation.
[03:21.16]The latter example – the one about the singer
[03:25.32]– uses the phrase "out of his mind,"
[03:28.28]meaning that the singer has lost control of his mind
[03:31.88]or went insane.
[03:33.96]Let's take some time to work with these ideas.
[03:37.40]Choose a linking verb to connect the noun "song"
[03:41.32]and the adjective "smooth."
[03:43.84]Pause the audio to consider your answer.
[03:48.36]Here is one possible answer:
[03:51.12]This song is smooth.
[03:54.40]Now describe a singer's voice
[03:57.04]by using the expression "out of this world,"
[04:00.40]meaning extremely impressive or enjoyable.
[04:04.28]Pause the audio to consider your answer.
[04:08.16]Here are two possible answers:
[04:10.76]Her voice is out of this world!
[04:13.84]Or
[04:15.56]His voice is out of this world!
[04:19.04]The next time you listen to music,
[04:21.28]ask yourself the following questions:
[04:24.40]How would you use what you have learned today
[04:27.96]to describe the music you are listening to?
[04:30.60]Are there other words or structures
[04:33.12]that you should use to describe the music?
[04:36.28]Asking yourself these kinds of questions
[04:39.48]can improve more than just your English skill.
[04:42.84]These questions could also
[04:45.56]deepen your enjoyment of the music itself.
