[00:00.04]Astronomers say they have observed a new exoplanet
[00:05.84]that orbits far away from its star
[00:10.04]although it is a large and massive planet.
[00:14.72]An international group of researchers said
[00:18.96]they learned new things about the planet
[00:22.44]after examining data
[00:24.76]from the James Webb Space Telescope.
[00:28.60]The telescope is operated
[00:31.40]by the American space agency NASA.
[00:36.08]The gas giant, which has been named Epsilon Indi A b,
[00:42.28]was first discovered in 2019.
[00:46.64]It is also known as a "super Jupiter,"
[00:51.12]meaning it is similar to Jupiter
[00:54.24]in our own solar system,
[00:56.68]but more massive.
[00:59.12]Scientists estimate the exoplanet's diameter
[01:04.68]is about the same as Jupiter's,
[01:08.12]but it is about six times more massive.
[01:12.16]The team said the planet has an atmosphere
[01:16.64]rich in hydrogen like Jupiter's.
[01:20.56]Epsilon Indi A b is estimated
[01:25.12]to be about 12 light-years away from Earth.
[01:29.44]A light year is the distance light travels
[01:34.20]in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers.
[01:39.68]International researchers led by Germany's
[01:44.60]Max Planck Institute
[01:46.84]examined new telescope images
[01:50.32]of Epsilon Indi A b.
[01:53.12]They said they learned the massive exoplanet
[01:57.92]orbits the star Epsilon Indi A,
[02:02.08]which is part of a three-star system.
[02:05.48]The scientists said one surprising discovery
[02:10.92]was that the exoplanet seems to take at least
[02:15.48]100 years to orbit its star
[02:19.16]and possibly as many as 250 years.
[02:24.20]The research shows Epsilon Indi A b
[02:29.28]orbits its star at a distance equal
[02:33.48]to 15 times the distance
[02:36.20]from the Earth to our own sun.
[02:39.52]The researchers said they were able to
[02:43.76]"directly" observe the gas giant
[02:47.00]by using a tool on the James Webb
[02:50.36]to block the light of the planet's main star.
[02:54.68]The team was then able to identify the exoplanet
[03:00.08]as a bright spot of infrared light.
[03:04.00]The new findings recently appeared
[03:08.84]in a study in the publication Nature.
[03:12.08]Scientists estimate the planet and star
[03:16.68]are about 3.5 billion years old.
[03:20.96]That is 1 billion years
[03:23.92]younger than our own solar system.
[03:27.08]Elisabeth Matthews is an astrophysicist
[03:31.96]at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy.
[03:35.76]Matthews led the research.
[03:39.52]She told The Associated Press in an email
[03:43.60]the exoplanet appears to be older
[03:47.20]and brighter than had been thought.
[03:50.52]The team noted the planet's star is so bright
[03:55.60]that it can be seen with the unaided eye
[03:59.20]from the Southern Hemisphere.
[04:01.44]But Matthews noted
[04:04.08]that nothing in the newly collected data
[04:07.24]suggests that Epsilon Indi A b
[04:11.40]has the right conditions to support life.
[04:15.76]"This is a gas giant with no hard surface
[04:20.00]or liquid water oceans," she said.
[04:24.00]Matthews said studying worlds
[04:27.84]similar to Jupiter can help scientists understand
[04:32.88]"how these planets evolve" over many, many years.
[04:37.92]The first exoplanets outside our solar system
[04:42.84]were confirmed in the early 1990s.
[04:46.80]NASA's total count today stands at about 5,690.
[04:54.36]The majority of these exoplanets were identified
[04:59.24]through the so-called "transit" method.
[05:02.56]This involves repeatedly observing drops in starlight
[05:08.20]that might happen when a planet
[05:10.72]partly blocks light from its star.
[05:14.72]Land- and spaced-based telescopes
[05:18.52]also search for new data on exoplanets,
[05:22.72]especially ones that might be similar to Earth.
[05:27.32]NASA launched the James Webb Space Telescope
[05:31.92]in 2021.
[05:34.04]It is currently the largest and most powerful
[05:38.72]astronomical observatory ever placed in space.
