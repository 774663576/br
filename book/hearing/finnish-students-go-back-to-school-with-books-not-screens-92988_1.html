瓦罗补充道：“如果你必须在深夜做作业，那么当你不是一直盯着电子设备的时候就更容易入睡。”</p>
<p>Minna Peltopuro is a psychologist working with the town on the change.

明娜·佩尔托普罗是一名与该镇合作进行改革的心理学家。她说，总屏幕使用时间应该减少，因为芬兰青少年目前平均每天盯着屏幕长达6个小时。她补充说，过度使用电子设备会带来身体和精神上的风险，比如视力问题和日益增长的焦虑。</p>
<p>Peltopuro added that the brain is at risk when trying to do more than one thing at a time. "Especially at a young age, one cannot manage it well," she said.<br/>
佩尔托普罗补充说，当试图同时做多件事时，大脑会面临风险。她说：“尤其是在年轻的时候，人们无法很好地应对它。”</p>

。
[00:01.88]This autumn,
[00:02.92]students in the Finnish town of Riihimaki
[00:05.96]headed back to school
[00:07.88]with backpacks full of books.
[00:10.16]This marks a change from recent years.
[00:13.96]For the past 10 years,
[00:15.48]the Finnish government pushed laptops
[00:18.28]and other electronic devices in the classroom.
[00:22.28]Finland's public education system
[00:25.04]is known for its good results
[00:27.16]and its readiness to try new teaching methods.
[00:31.36]Until recently,
[00:32.68]many schools gave laptops for free
[00:35.16]to all students from as early as age 11.
[00:39.92]But Finnish parents and teachers
[00:42.32]have become increasingly concerned
[00:44.96]over the effect of screens on children.
[00:48.80]Riihimaki is a town of about 30,000 people.
[00:53.52]It sits 70 kilometers north of the capital, Helsinki.
[00:58.92]In 2018, the town's middle schools
[01:02.32]stopped using most books.
[01:05.04]But this school year, schools in Riihimaki
[01:08.48]are going back to pen and paper.
[01:12.00]"Young people are using phones
[01:14.16]and digital devices so much these days
[01:17.12]that we don't want school to be one of the places
[01:20.28]where children are only staring at screens,"
[01:23.56]said Maija Kaunonen, an English teacher
[01:26.92]at Pohjolanrinne middle school.
[01:30.80]The distractions that come with the use
[01:33.00]of digital devices make many children restless
[01:36.52]and unable to give their full attention
[01:38.88]to learning, Kaunonen said.
[01:42.52]She added, "Most students
[01:45.24]just did the exercises as quick as they could"
[01:48.08]so they could then move on to using social media.
[01:52.52]"And it took them no time at all
[01:54.20]to change tabs in the browser.
[01:57.20]So when the teacher came round to them,
[02:00.08]they could say: 'Yes, I was doing this exercise'."
[02:05.20]Across Finland, children's learning results
[02:08.04]have been slowly getting worse in recent years.
[02:12.20]In answer, the government plans new laws
[02:15.36]to ban the use of personal devices, such as phones,
[02:18.76]during school hours to cut back on screen time.
[02:23.40]One of Kaunonen's students
[02:25.52]is 14-year-old Elle Sokka.
[02:29.44]She said she did not always pay attention
[02:31.96]to the school subjects
[02:33.36]when learning digitally.
[02:36.64]Instead, she moved to another web page.
[02:40.12]Eighth-graders Miko Mantila
[02:42.92]and Inka Warro, both 14,
[02:46.12]said their concentration has improved
[02:48.72]since books returned to the classrooms.
[02:52.44]"Reading, for one, is much easier
[02:54.68]and I can read much faster from books," Mantila said.
[02:59.80]"And if you have to do homework late at night,
[03:02.36]it's easier to go to sleep
[03:04.32]when you haven't just been looking at a device," Warro added.
[03:09.56]Minna Peltopuro is a psychologist
[03:12.44]working with the town on the change.
[03:15.96]She said the total screen time should be cut
[03:19.44]because Finnish teenagers currently stare at a screen
[03:22.88]for up to six hours each day on average.
[03:27.28]She added that too much use of electronic devices
[03:31.08]comes with both physical and mental risks,
[03:34.04]such as eye problems and growing anxiety.
[03:38.64]Peltopuro added that the brain is at risk
[03:41.72]when trying to do more than one thing at a time.
[03:45.48]"Especially at a young age,
[03:47.28]one cannot manage it well," she said.
