。
[00:01.00]About an hour's drive from the tall buildings of Dubai
[00:06.12]is an empty village in the sands of the United Arab Emirates.
[00:12.24]It stands as a reminder of how fast
[00:15.48]the Middle Eastern country is changing.
[00:19.64]Built in the 1970s,
[00:22.08]the village of al-Ghuraifa was left empty twenty years later.
[00:27.96]Oil wealth has turned the UAE,
[00:31.48]home to the cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi,
[00:35.40]into an international center of commerce and tourism.
[00:41.44]In recent years,
[00:43.32]the empty village near the town of al-Madam
[00:46.88]in the Sharjah emirate has become more popular with visitors.
[00:53.08]The village, made up of two rows of homes and a religious center,
[00:59.80]"can teach us a lot of the modern history of the UAE,"
[01:04.92]said Ahmad Sukkar of the University of Sharjah.
[01:09.76]Sukkar is part of a team studying the area.
[01:14.16]Al-Ghuraifa was built as part of a public housing project
[01:19.44]after the 1971 establishment of the United Arab Emirates,
[01:25.96]a group of seven sheikhdoms.
[01:28.68]The discovery of oil 13 years earlier
[01:33.60]was just starting to reshape the country.
[01:38.04]The village housed around 100 members
[01:41.32]of the al-Ketbi tribe, Sukkar said.
[01:45.32]They were one of several Bedouin groups
[01:48.16]that until then had led a semi-nomadic existence.
[01:53.40]They raised animals, traveled among the desert oases
[01:58.32]and visited Dubai and Abu Dhabi when they were small towns.
[02:04.84]The modern cement houses were built with local details
[02:09.16]to ease the change to settled life.
[02:13.04]The inside walls were brightly colored,
[02:16.00]and some had mosaics.
[02:18.72]The homes also had spaces
[02:21.20]where village leaders could gather locals for meetings.
[02:25.60]One house had special paper known as wallpaper
[02:30.36]showing a land with green plants and trees -
[02:34.76]a big difference from the sandy environment outside.
[02:40.24]It is unclear what exactly caused people to leave
[02:43.88]just twenty years after the homes were built.
[02:47.08]Some say that they were driven away by evil spirits.
[02:51.64]But Sukkar says it is more likely that people left
[02:56.12]to seek a better life in the UAE's fast-growing cities.
[03:01.84]The village had limited electricity and water,
[03:05.72]and was often hit by sandstorms.
[03:09.00]Families would have also had to deal with
[03:12.76]long traveling times across the desert
[03:16.00]to reach government jobs and schools in Dubai.
[03:20.88]Now, the desert is slowly taking back the village.
[03:25.28]Sand has blown into the homes.
[03:29.32]Only the religious center, or mosque, remains as it was,
[03:35.00]thanks to regular cleaning by workers from nearby al-Madam.
[03:41.56]Some descendants of the camel-mounted Bedouin
[03:45.60]who once traveled the desert sands
[03:48.00]still live in the Emirates' rural areas.
[03:52.76]However, many now live in cities with tall buildings,
[03:57.64]large shopping centers, and modern roads.
[04:01.48]Foreign nationals make up the majority of the UAE's population,
[04:07.76]and some have taken an interest in its history.
[04:11.80]It is also a place for them to record music videos
[04:16.72]and social media posts.
[04:19.16]On a recent day, groups of visitors
[04:22.48]walked through the abandoned village.
[04:25.52]"I wonder why they left," said Nitin Panchal,
[04:29.76]an Indian living in the UAE.
[04:33.00]"Could it be a genie," could it be "black magic?"
[04:37.12]Panchal asked. "We'll never know."
[04:40.96]The local government recently installed
[04:43.72]fencing along with a security gate,
[04:46.96]waste containers and a parking lot.
[04:50.16]Officials made the changes
[04:52.76]because past visitors had caused damage to the village.
[04:57.80]The new measures have taken some of the mystery from the village.
