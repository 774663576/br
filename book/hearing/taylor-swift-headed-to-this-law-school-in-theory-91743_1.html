南达科他大学法学教授肖恩·坎默的朋友告诉他，他们不确定他即将开设的关于音乐表演者泰勒·斯威夫特的课程的严肃性。</p>
<p>"I understand this sounds ridiculous, at least at first glance," said Kammer, a Taylor Swift fan, or Swiftie, himself. "But it's not."
作为泰勒·斯威夫特粉丝的坎默说：“我理解这听起来很荒谬，至少乍一看是这样，但事实并非如此。”</p>
<p>Kammer's class, called the Taylor Swift effect, is planned for the spring. It is believed to be the first law school class based on the famous American singer.<br/>
坎默计划在春季开设的课程名为泰勒·斯威夫特效应。据信，这是第一门以这位著名美国歌手为原型的法学院课程。</p>
<p>After attending a Swift concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in June, Kammer said he was inspired to develop the writing class. It is available for second- and third-year law students.<br/>
今年6月，坎默参加了斯威夫特在明尼苏达州明尼阿波利斯市的一场演唱会，他说自己受到启发开发这门写作课程。这么课程将向法律系大二和大三学生开放。</p>
<p>The class will study the artist's dealings with the law, including her rerecording of six albums and related copyright problems, Kammer said.<br/>
坎默说，该课程将研究这位艺术家对法律问题的处理，包括她重新录制的六张专辑和相关的版权问题。</p>
<p>It will also examine how an individual's experiences and beliefs shape how they understand the law – much like how there are different understandings of her songs.<br/>
它还将考察个人的经历和信仰如何影响他们对法律的理解——就像人们对她的歌曲有不同的理解一样。</p>
<p>Law classes about popular culture are not uncommon. They also bring attention to schools that offer them. The television show The Wire inspired a number of criminal law classes over the years. In 2022, the University of Virginia School of Law offered a class on corporate law based on the show Succession.<br/>
关于流行文化的法律课并不少见。它们也引起了人们对提供这类课程的学校的关注。这些年来，电视节目《火线》激发了许多刑法课程的灵感。2022年，弗吉尼亚大学法学院在《继承》节目的基础上开设了一门公司法课程。</p>
<p>Law classes centered on a single public person are rare, however. But Georgia State University College of Law is currently offering a class based on the legal life of musician Rick Ross.<br/>
然而，以一个公众人物为中心的法律课程并不多见。但佐治亚州立大学法学院目前正在开设一门以音乐家里克·罗斯的法律生活为基础的课程。</p>
<p>Boston University law professor Jessica Silbey helped write a book on popular culture and the law. She said students are usually more interested when they study subjects such as sports, new technology and famous people.<br/>
波士顿大学法学教授杰西卡·西尔贝帮助撰写了一本关于流行文化和法律的书。她说，学生们通常在学习体育、新技术和名人等科目时更感兴趣。</p>
<p>Silbey teaches Swift's album rerecordings in her copyright class to teach about contract law in the music business. She said the singer's success story and what she has dealt with provide good lessons in the law.<br/>
西尔贝在她的版权课上通过讲述斯威夫特重新录制专辑来讲授音乐行业的合同法。她说，这位歌手的成功经历和处置经验提供了很好的法律教训。</p>
<p>South Dakota Law is not the first school to offer classes on Swift. The University of California at Berkeley recently announced an upcoming business class based on Swift's business experiences.

南达科他大学法学院并不是第一所基于斯威夫特开设课程的学校。加州大学伯克利分校最近宣布，即将开设一门基于斯威夫特商业经验的商务课程。斯坦福大学、纽约大学和得克萨斯大学也开设了以斯威夫特为灵感的课程。但坎默的课程是首次对她的音乐和职业生涯进行法律探索。</p>
<p>Kammer also teaches legal history. He said he plans to examine some Swift songs to look into how the words of the songs and certain legal texts can be understood. He said his class will also look at good and bad qualities of methods for understanding the law.<br/>
坎默还教授法律史。他说，他计划研究斯威夫特的一些歌曲，以了解歌曲的歌词和某些法律文本可以如何理解。他说，他的课程还将研究理解法律的方法的优劣。</p>

。
[00:01.88]University of South Dakota law professor Sean Kammer's friends
[00:06.60]told him they were unsure about the seriousness
[00:09.84]of his upcoming class on musical performer Taylor Swift.
[00:15.36]"I understand this sounds ridiculous, at least at first glance,"
[00:19.44]said Kammer, a Taylor Swift fan, or Swiftie, himself. "But it's not."
[00:26.08]Kammer's class, called the Taylor Swift effect,
[00:28.92]is planned for the spring.
[00:31.56]It is believed to be the first law school class
[00:35.04]based on the famous American singer.
[00:38.72]After attending a Swift concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in June,
[00:43.28]Kammer said he was inspired to develop the writing class.
[00:48.52]It is available for second- and third-year law students.
[00:52.12]The class will study the artist's dealings with the law,
[00:56.24]including her rerecording of six albums
[00:59.24]and related copyright problems, Kammer said.
[01:03.64]It will also examine how an individual's experiences
[01:07.48]and beliefs shape how they understand the law
[01:11.12]– much like how there are different understandings of her songs.
[01:16.04]Law classes about popular culture are not uncommon.
[01:20.68]They also bring attention to schools that offer them.
[01:24.36]The television show The Wire
[01:27.56]inspired a number of criminal law classes over the years.
[01:33.12]In 2022, the University of Virginia School of Law
[01:37.60]offered a class on corporate law
[01:39.96]based on the show Succession.
[01:43.44]Law classes centered on a single public person
[01:46.64]are rare, however.
[01:49.00]But Georgia State University College of Law
[01:51.88]is currently offering a class
[01:54.24]based on the legal life of musician Rick Ross.
[01:59.00]Boston University law professor Jessica Silbey
[02:02.56]helped write a book on popular culture and the law.
[02:07.16]She said students are usually more interested
[02:10.04]when they study subjects such as sports,
[02:12.80]new technology and famous people.
[02:16.76]Silbey teaches Swift's album
[02:18.92]rerecordings in her copyright class
[02:21.48]to teach about contract law in the music business.
[02:26.12]She said the singer's success story
[02:28.96]and what she has dealt with provide good lessons in the law.
[02:34.20]South Dakota Law is not the first school
[02:36.84]to offer classes on Swift.
[02:39.68]The University of California at Berkeley
[02:42.68]recently announced an upcoming business class
[02:45.80]based on Swift's business experiences.
[02:50.08]Stanford, New York University, and the University of Texas
[02:54.84]have also offered Swift-inspired classes.
[02:59.24]But Kammer's class is the first
[03:01.24]legal exploration of her music and career.
[03:05.44]Kammer also teaches legal history.
[03:08.16]He said he plans to examine some Swift songs
[03:12.24]to look into how the words of the songs
[03:15.04]and certain legal texts can be understood.
[03:19.24]He said his class will also look at good
[03:21.84]and bad qualities of methods
[03:24.80]for understanding the law.
