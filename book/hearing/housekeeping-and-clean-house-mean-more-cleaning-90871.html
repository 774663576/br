<p>Spring cleaning is a popular activity for many people. It is a chance to get rid of unnecessary items and get their homes clean and organized.

<p>Spring cleaning is a thorough cleaning <u>inside and out</u>.</p>
<p>So, on today's program we are going to <u>clean house,</u> too!</p>
<p>Daily cleaning tasks like doing the laundry or dishes are not considered spring cleaning. That is often called <u>housekeeping</u> or <u>cleaning house</u>. We use both of these terms in <strong>idiomatic</strong> ways.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about <u>cleaning house.</u> When an organization, business or other group clean house, it gets rid of people or policies that make trouble or that do not work.</p>
<p>Here's an example.</p>
<p><em>My friend has a company that is suffering from troublemaking and non-productive employees. If the owner wants the company to succeed, she may need to clean house and fire anyone not contributing. </em></p>
<p><u>Cleaning house</u> can also mean to wipe out <strong>corruption</strong> or <strong>inefficiency</strong>. When we use it this way, we are often talking about a political party or a governmental office.</p>
<p>Here's an example for that situation:</p>
<p><em>The city official in charge of education reform made <u>cleaning house on corruption and waste</u> the first item on his to-do list. </em></p>
<p>Sometimes we put words in between "clean" and "house" to make the expression more specific, as in this example:</p>
<p><em>To help their company succeed, the business partners needed to <u>clean their financial house</u>. And that meant hiring a new financial manager – one that wouldn't steal from them. </em></p>
<p>If you research the expression online, you may find another meaning for "cleaning house" – to punish or to give a beating. For example, the bully threatened to clean house on anyone who disagreed with him. But this usage is not as common as getting rid of <strong>ineffectual</strong>, troublesome or wasteful elements in a group.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about <u>housekeeping</u>.</p>
<p><u>Housekeeping</u> defines the act of <strong>managing</strong> a household. Cleaning, organizing, paying the bills, and keeping food stocked can all be called housekeeping. Sometimes we call this <u>putting our house in order</u>. When we put our house in order we make sure it is running smoothly. It can also mean to organize your finances and other responsibilities, especially when preparing for a life-changing event.</p>
<p>Used as a noun, housekeeping is also the department at a hotel in charge of keeping your room clean and stocked with necessary items like towels and soap.</p>
<p>Housekeeping also describes any repeated tasks that keep a business or organization running smoothly. So, housekeeping issues for a business could be managing and scheduling resources. It could also be tasks like keeping your computer up and running or updating staff on events or policy changes.</p>
<p>So, think of it this way. Housekeeping issues are the day-to-day, ongoing tasks and responsibilities that keep a business, home, or organization running smoothly. And cleaning house is to get rid of anything that is not working or is creating a mess – either <strong>literally</strong> or <strong>figuratively</strong>.</p>
<p>As for usage, both of these expressions can be used in <strong>formal</strong> and <strong>informal </strong>situations.</p>
<p>That's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo!</p>

[00:07.36]And now, Words and Their Stories, from VOA Learning English.
[00:14.48]Spring is a time of the year when many people take time to clean.
[00:27.44]They straighten up messy areas of their homes. They tidy up!
[00:34.24]Spring cleaning is a popular activity for many people.
[00:39.40]It is a chance to get rid of unnecessary items
[00:43.72]and get their homes clean and organized.
[00:49.08]Spring cleaning usually involves big projects,
[00:53.12]such as taking down and washing curtains,
[00:57.56]shaking out rugs and cleaning carpets,
[01:01.84]perhaps clearing out and cleaning up cabinets and closets.
[01:08.76]Spring cleaning is a thorough cleaning inside and out.
[01:14.80]So, on today's program we are going to clean house, too!
[01:20.08]Daily cleaning tasks like doing the laundry or dishes
[01:24.52]are not considered spring cleaning.
[01:28.08]That is often called housekeeping or cleaning house.
[01:33.80]We use both of these terms in idiomatic ways.
[01:39.72]First, let's talk about cleaning house.
[01:43.08]When an organization, business or other group clean house,
[01:49.00]it gets rid of people or policies that make trouble or that do not work.
[01:56.20]Here's an example.
[01:59.00]My friend has a company that is suffering from troublemaking
[02:02.52]and non-productive employees.
[02:05.88]If the owner wants the company to succeed,
[02:08.80]she may need to clean house and fire anyone not contributing.
[02:13.12]Cleaning house can also mean to wipe out corruption or inefficiency.
[02:21.28]When we use it this way,
[02:23.36]we are often talking about a political party or a governmental office.
[02:30.84]Here's an example for that situation:
[02:34.24]The city official in charge of education reform
[02:38.08]made cleaning house on corruption and waste
[02:41.64]the first item on his to-do list.
[02:44.68]Sometimes we put words in between "clean" and "house"
[02:49.68]to make the expression more specific, as in this example:
[02:55.72]To help their company succeed,
[02:57.92]the business partners needed to clean their financial house.
[03:02.28]And that meant hiring a new financial manager –
[03:06.00]one that wouldn't steal from them.
[03:08.72]If you research the expression online,
[03:12.16]you may find another meaning for "cleaning house" –
[03:15.72]to punish or to give a beating.
[03:20.36]For example, the bully threatened to clean house
[03:24.24]on anyone who disagreed with him.
[03:28.08]But this usage is not as common as getting rid of ineffectual,
[03:34.00]troublesome or wasteful elements in a group.
[03:39.48]Now let's talk about housekeeping.
[03:43.20]Housekeeping defines the act of managing a household.
[03:48.24]Cleaning, organizing, paying the bills,
[03:52.20]and keeping food stocked can all be called housekeeping.
[03:58.16]Sometimes we call this putting our house in order.
[04:02.64]When we put our house in order we make sure it is running smoothly.
[04:09.28]It can also mean to organize your finances and other responsibilities,
[04:15.84]especially when preparing for a life-changing event.
[04:21.64]Used as a noun, housekeeping is also the department at a hotel
[04:26.80]in charge of keeping your room clean and stocked
[04:31.28]with necessary items like towels and soap.
[04:37.24]Housekeeping also describes any repeated tasks
[04:41.16]that keep a business or organization running smoothly.
[04:46.56]So, housekeeping issues for a business
[04:49.48]could be managing and scheduling resources.
[04:54.48]It could also be tasks like keeping your computer up and running
[04:59.52]or updating staff on events or policy changes.
[05:06.52]So, think of it this way. Housekeeping issues are the day-to-day,
[05:11.96]ongoing tasks and responsibilities
[05:15.20]that keep a business, home, or organization running smoothly.
[05:20.76]And cleaning house is to get rid of anything that is not working
[05:26.88]or is creating a mess – either literally or figuratively.
[05:34.56]As for usage, both of these expressions
[05:37.48]can be used in formal and informal situations.
[05:42.08]That's all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories.
[05:47.60]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo!
