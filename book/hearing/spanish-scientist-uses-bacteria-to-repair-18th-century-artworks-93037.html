。
[00:00.04]Spanish scientist Pilar Bosch
[00:03.88]has found a way to use bacteria
[00:07.16]to repair 18th-century paintings.
[00:11.48]Bosch, a microbiologist,
[00:14.68]tells Reuters she got the idea for the method
[00:19.20]while considering possibilities for a paper
[00:23.16]toward her doctoral degree.
[00:25.68]During this process,
[00:28.20]she discovered someone else's paper
[00:31.24]that suggested bacteria
[00:33.72]can be used to restore artworks.
[00:37.92]At around the same time,
[00:40.56]Bosch learned that her mother
[00:42.60]was struggling to find a good method
[00:45.56]for restoring 18th-century paintings.
[00:49.52]The paintings, by Spanish artist Antonio Palomino,
[00:54.92]sat in Santos Juanes
[00:57.64]– one of the oldest churches in the city of Valencia.
[01:02.56]Bosch said her mother, Pilar Roig,
[01:06.48]noted how difficult the restoration process
[01:10.80]at the church was.
[01:13.24]One reason was the glue used
[01:16.40]to remove the paintings from the walls in the 1960s.
[01:21.60]The substance was nearly impossible
[01:24.68]to remove completely.
[01:26.44]"My mother had a very difficult problem to solve
[01:30.92]and I found a paper about bacteria
[01:34.12]used to clean frescoes in Italy," Bosch said.
[01:39.32]A fresco is a kind of painting that
[01:42.84]often appears across a large wall.
[01:46.48]Bosch added she decided
[01:49.08]to write her doctoral paper on the same subject.
[01:53.32]That was more than ten years ago.
[01:56.84]Today, she gets to work with her mother
[02:00.16]on the church restoration.
[02:02.52]They are using the bacteria method
[02:05.48]to remove glue from artworks.
[02:08.88]The $4.46 million project
[02:12.84]is being financed by local organizations.
[02:17.08]The process involves
[02:19.16]feeding small amounts of the glue
[02:22.04]– made from animal collagen – to the bacteria.
[02:26.56]After a time, the bacteria begins
[02:29.92]to naturally produce enzymes
[02:32.84]to break down the glue.
[02:35.36]The mother-daughter team then mixes the bacteria
[02:40.12]with a natural algae-based substance, called a gel,
[02:45.32]and places it onto the paintings.
[02:48.04]They say that after about three hours,
[02:51.92]the gel mixture is removed,
[02:54.44]leaving the paintings glue-free.
[02:57.92]Bosch's mother, now 75,
[03:02.04]noted that in the past,
[03:04.44]restorers of artworks had to use
[03:07.52]traditional cleaning methods
[03:09.32]that "took hours and damaged the painting."
[03:13.40]She noted that several other relatives in the family
[03:17.92]also work in art restoration.
[03:21.00]Bosch agreed, saying the work
[03:24.12]"certainly runs in the family."
[03:26.76]Bosch has also used her bacteria removal process
[03:31.64]in other restoration projects in Italy and Spain.
[03:36.84]And, she is now training other scientists
[03:40.84]to use a different kind of bacteria
[03:43.84]to clear walls of painted graffiti.
