。
[00:00.04]A California wildlife organization
[00:03.68]says it has been rescuing
[00:06.48]sick sea lions in recent weeks
[00:10.04]showing signs of algae poisoning.
[00:14.16]On August 1, the Santa Barbara-based
[00:18.12]Channel Islands Marine &amp; Wildlife Institute
[00:22.48]said teams had rescued at least 23 animals.
[00:28.12]The U.S. Vandenberg Space Force Base
[00:31.96]recently released photos on social media
[00:35.60]of sea lions being taken
[00:38.00]from one of its beaches.
[00:40.76]The institute said that since July 26,
[00:45.32]it had received numerous reports
[00:48.00]daily of sick lions
[00:50.64]along a 250-kilometer stretch of coastline
[00:55.52]in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.
[01:00.32]The group said in a statement
[01:03.00]the sea creatures were found
[01:05.44]to be suffering from the effects
[01:07.92]of domoic acid, a poison
[01:11.36]that can harm the brain and heart.
[01:14.92]The release of the acid in a large ocean event
[01:19.08]is known as an algae bloom.
[01:22.64]The poison is produced by microscopic algae
[01:27.56]eaten by shellfish or small fish.
[01:31.40]Those shellfish or fish
[01:34.12]are often then eaten by sea lions,
[01:37.24]dolphins or birds.
[01:39.96]The algae can also sicken humans.
[01:43.96]Among the signs of sickness
[01:46.56]experienced by affected sea lions
[01:49.40]are unusual head movements,
[01:52.28]disorientation, foaming at the mouth and seizures.
[01:58.16]In a message published on Facebook August 4,
[02:02.24]the institute said the poisoning event was
[02:06.28]"heating up," with new cases of sick sea lions
[02:10.36]still appearing at multiple beaches.
[02:14.28]It explained that rescue teams
[02:17.20]first try to get the animals in a net
[02:20.76]so they can be transported for treatment
[02:23.80]and then returned to the sea.
[02:27.00]The U.S. National Oceanic
[02:29.60]and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says
[02:33.88]poisoning events linked
[02:35.88]to domoic acid are common
[02:38.52]along the California coast.
[02:41.68]Experts said the latest poisoning event
[02:45.72]seems to mostly be affecting
[02:48.40]adult female sea lions.
[02:51.72]Last year, an especially severe poisoning event
[02:56.00]killed hundreds of sea lions
[02:58.60]and a number of dolphins
[03:00.76]during the first weeks of June.
