。
[00:00.04]The U.S. government has issued
[00:02.72]final rules for operating air taxis.
[00:07.16]It has also set training
[00:09.80]and approval requirements for pilots.
[00:13.32]The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
[00:18.84]announced the new rules.
[00:21.12]They were announced October 22.
[00:24.40]The FAA explains that air taxis
[00:29.00]belong to a kind of aircraft
[00:31.60]known as Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) flyers.
[00:37.48]These aircraft are generally
[00:40.12]highly automated and electrically powered.
[00:43.76]They also have vertical take-off
[00:47.12]and landing abilities, the agency said.
[00:50.96]Air taxis are part of the AAM group, or category.
[00:57.40]But they are also considered
[01:00.04]"power-lift" vehicles.
[01:02.56]The aircraft have elements of both
[01:05.16]airplanes and helicopters, the FAA said.
[01:09.68]Other power-lift vehicles are designed
[01:13.12]to transport goods rather than people.
[01:17.28]These aircraft take off and land vertically
[01:21.56]but can fly like fixed-wing planes.
[01:25.12]Many companies have designed
[01:27.68]and built such models
[01:30.00]and are working to get them to market.
[01:32.80]But the efforts have been delayed
[01:35.44]because of a lack of final requirements,
[01:38.96]or regulations, governing their use.
[01:42.40]FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker
[01:46.60]said powered-lift aircraft represent
[01:50.28]"the first new category of aircraft
[01:53.36]in nearly 80 years."
[01:55.92]He added that the new rules
[01:58.64]are meant to open the door
[02:00.84]to supporting widespread AAM operations
[02:04.96]in the U.S. in the future.
[02:07.64]Whitaker said the new rules aim to make sure
[02:12.44]"this new generation of aircraft
[02:15.48]maintain the high level of safety
[02:18.20]that defines modern aviation."
[02:21.16]The goal is to establish requirements
[02:24.88]to ensure that AAMs
[02:27.56]"are able to safely operate
[02:29.84]in our National Airspace System
[02:33.04]alongside existing aircraft."
[02:35.84]The FAA has said air taxi operations
[02:40.76]will begin slowly.
[02:42.48]In the beginning, air taxis
[02:45.00]will use existing travel paths
[02:47.64]and landing structures
[02:49.84]currently used by helicopters.
[02:52.72]The new rules will permit pilots
[02:55.80]to train with a single set of flight controls.
[02:59.56]Past FAA rules required two flight controls
[03:04.56]– one for the student
[03:06.36]and one for the flight instructor.
[03:09.16]Air taxi supporters call the aircraft
[03:13.20]a cleaner choice compared to passenger airplanes,
[03:17.36]which burn jet fuel.
[03:19.36]Supporters have called
[03:21.28]for widespread expansion of the flyers
[03:24.36]beginning as early as 2025.
[03:27.60]But experts say current technology limitations
[03:32.76]make it likely air taxis will only be able
[03:36.36]to operate at first in large cities.
[03:40.28]One company developing AAMs
[03:43.16]is California-based Joby Aviation.
[03:46.72]It praised the new FAA rules.
[03:50.64]Company chief JoeBen Bevirt said the rules
[03:54.84]"will ensure the U.S. continues
[03:57.52]to play a global leadership role
[04:00.16]in the development and adoption of clean flight."
[04:04.28]Some airline companies have said they see air taxis
[04:08.88]as a way to transport passengers to airports.
[04:13.36]In 2022, Delta Air Lines said it would invest
[04:17.84]$60 million in Joby.
[04:20.72]And this month, Toyota announced
[04:24.04]a $500 million investment in the company.
[04:28.20]United Airlines is backing
[04:30.52]another California-based company, Archer Aviation.
[04:34.92]The Associated Press reports
[04:37.56]that United has ordered 200 aircraft,
[04:41.44]which Archer said could be worth up to $1 billion.
[04:46.36]Former acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen
[04:50.88]is currently Archer's chief safety officer.
[04:55.36]He told the Reuters news agency
[04:58.16]that the new FAA rules represent
[05:01.44]a big step forward
[05:03.36]for the future deployment of flying air taxis.
[05:07.36]"Now we've got a roadmap," Nolen said.
