[00:00.04]Fig trees are native to Europe
[00:03.36]around the Mediterranean Sea, Asia and Africa,
[00:07.92]but they can grow in much cooler climates.
[00:12.16]Once mature, fig trees can accept temperatures
[00:17.00]even a few degrees below freezing.
[00:19.84]Some kinds of fig trees
[00:22.64]do better in such environments than others.
[00:26.80]Associated Press gardening expert Jessica Damiano
[00:31.88]recently wrote about caring for fig trees.
[00:36.12]She said all kinds of the trees could use protection.
[00:41.32]Depending on the weather and pruning,
[00:44.56]a fig can grow into a shrub or a tree.
[00:48.56]Shrubs with several stems growing from the ground
[00:53.08]do best if covered for the winter.
[00:57.12]Trees with a single stem, or trunk,
[01:01.24]can be either covered or buried.
[01:05.12]Either way, wait until the trees
[01:08.56]have dropped most of their leaves.
[01:11.36]One popular method for burying trees
[01:15.60]for their protection is called "the Minnesota tip."
[01:20.08]It involves digging a narrow, shallow area
[01:24.64]where the tree can be laid.
[01:28.36]The space should be about 30 centimeters deep,
[01:32.52]60 centimeters wide and as long as the tree is tall.
[01:39.88]To prepare the tree, gather its branches
[01:43.64]and tie them together with soft rope.
[01:48.08]Next, push a shovel into the soil
[01:52.00]about a half-meter from the trunk
[01:54.96]on the side opposite the hole.
[01:58.76]Lift that side of the tree's root ball out of the ground.
[02:03.88]Then, gently push the tree toward the hole.
[02:08.20]When it is lying flat, cover the tree with plastic.
[02:13.48]Pack soil around the exposed side of the roots,
[02:17.84]and around the length of the tree.
[02:20.84]Load soil over the tree.
[02:23.24]Make it at least 30 centimeters deep.
[02:27.44]You will need more soil than you removed from digging.
[02:32.92]If you are covering, or wrapping, the tree instead,
[02:36.68]you will need cardboard, a pail,
[02:40.00]and a roll each of burlap,
[02:43.04]eavy brown paper and tar paper.
[02:47.52]If the tree is under three years old,
[02:50.48]cut it back by one-third its size.
[02:54.24]Then, pull the branches inward
[02:57.20]and tie them together with soft but strong rope.
[03:02.68]Working upwards from the bottom,
[03:05.48]put burlap around the tree.
[03:08.80]Then put heavy brown paper around the burlap
[03:12.80]and tie it into place.
[03:16.00]Remove some soil from around the base of the tree.
[03:20.52]Place a large piece of cardboard into the space
[03:25.16]and bend it around the bottom half of the tree.
[03:29.64]Tie the cardboard into place.
[03:33.00]Next, wrap tar paper around the tree.
[03:37.48]Position it outward from top to bottom.
[03:41.32]This will direct rain away from the tree.
[03:46.24]Place soil around the tree's base, creating a little hill.
[03:51.64]Place a pail upside-down over the top of the tree
[03:56.32]to keep the rain off.
[03:59.32]Unwrap the tree on a cloudy day in early spring,
[04:03.68]soon after the last frost.
