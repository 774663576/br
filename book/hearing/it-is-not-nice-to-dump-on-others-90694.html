[00:08.08]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.64]from VOA Learning English.
[00:15.00]Trash may not be a glamorous subject.
[00:24.08]But it is an important one.
[00:28.12]We can throw our trash
[00:29.88]into a container called a trash can.
[00:33.88]We can dispose of our garbage
[00:36.32]in a garbage can.
[00:38.84]We can dump our unwanted things
[00:41.84]in a dumpster.
[00:44.44]All these unwanted things might end up
[00:47.76]at a landfill, sometimes called a dump.
[00:53.24]We explored being down in the dumps
[00:55.80]in a recent Words and Their Stories.
[00:59.56]Being at the bottom of a dump
[01:01.56]is probably not a nice place to be.
[01:05.88]If you are down in the dumps, you feel sad.
[01:09.68]Down in the dumps means you have the blues,
[01:14.40]or you feel out of sorts.
[01:17.40]You are the opposite of happy.
[01:21.32]If your friend is down in the dumps,
[01:23.84]you could try to do something fun
[01:26.48]to lift their spirits.
[01:28.64]You could take them to their favorite restaurant
[01:31.72]or a movie to cheer them up.
[01:36.20]The verb "dump" means to place things without care.
[01:40.92]For example, when I wash my clothes,
[01:44.00]I dump the dirty clothes on the floor
[01:47.08]in front of the washer.
[01:49.68]But I don't dump the clean clothes on the floor.
[01:53.76]They are clean!
[01:55.52]Dumping them on the floor
[01:57.88]could make them dirty again.
[02:01.68]We can dump other things besides
[02:04.32]trash and dirty clothes.
[02:07.20]If you dump on someone
[02:09.44]you say bad things about them.
[02:12.52]You show them little respect.
[02:15.72]And at work,
[02:17.64]you do not want to receive a document dump.
[02:22.64]This means someone has given you
[02:25.36]a huge number of documents.
[02:28.24]Usually, you have to deal with them in some way.
[02:33.20]Now, let's hear these "dump" expressions
[02:36.28]in a conversation between two co-workers.
[02:40.64]A: Hey, let's go! TGIF!
[02:43.92]Time to have some fun!
[02:46.00]B: [sounds sad]I can't.
[02:47.56]You guys go ahead without me.
[02:50.16]A: Why?
[02:51.32]And why are you so down in the dumps?
[02:54.12]B: Karen just dumped
[02:56.52]a huge stack of work on my desk.
[02:59.96]A: She gave you a document dump
[03:02.12]at 5 o'clock on Friday?
[03:05.36]B: She did. And she wants me to file it
[03:08.60]all before I leave.
[03:10.12]A: Can't you tell her
[03:11.84]you'll do it on Monday morning?
[03:13.96]B: I tried. She said no.
[03:16.80]A: You know, she did that to me once
[03:19.60]and I dumped her document dump
[03:22.20]right in the dumpster.
[03:24.92]B: Did you get in trouble?
[03:26.64]A: No. She didn't even
[03:29.48]ask about those stupid papers.
[03:32.60]I don't mean to dump on her,
[03:34.60]but dumping a bunch of needless work
[03:37.88]on someone on a Friday
[03:39.80]is a mean thing to do.
[03:42.04]B: You know what...you're right!
[03:44.56]I'm coming with you guys.
[03:46.40]This document dump can wait until Monday.
[03:50.20]And that's all the time
[03:52.80]we have for this Words and Their Stories.
[03:55.64]Until next time.
[03:56.96]I'm Anna Matteo.
