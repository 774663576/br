。
[00:00.04]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.68]from VOA Learning English.
[00:18.56]You can trust that we are actually
[00:22.04]Voice of America Learning English.
[00:25.00]We are the real deal. We are authentic.
[00:29.80]In other words, we are not bogus.
[00:34.76]Bogus is an adjective that means fake or phony.
[00:40.00]Something bogus is not genuine.
[00:43.96]It is a fraud. It's fraudulent.
[00:48.64]For example, the man's huge diamond ring was bogus.
[00:53.64]He told everyone it was a real diamond.
[00:57.20]But actually, it was just a piece of glass.
[01:02.32]Bogus can describe something that is a lie.
[01:07.20]If something like an explanation
[01:10.12]or reason is bogus, it's not true.
[01:14.80]For example, an employee might call her employer
[01:18.52]to say she needs a sick day off from work.
[01:22.36]But during the call, her boss hears loud,
[01:26.64]live music in the background.
[01:29.76]The employee was clearly at a music show.
[01:33.60]Her reason for not being at work was bogus.
[01:38.96]We could also say the employee's excuse did not hold water.
[01:44.56]Her excuse for missing work sounded bogus.
[01:48.48]It was not believable. It didn't hold water.
[01:54.32]Experts at the online dictionary Merriam-Webster explain
[01:58.92]that bogus began as a noun.
[02:03.24]In the early 19th century in the U.S.,
[02:06.40]a bogus was a machine
[02:09.00]that made counterfeit, or fake, money.
[02:13.76]Here's a fun fact: You can call bogus,
[02:16.96]counterfeit money funny money.
[02:20.84]Here is another word related to bogus – sham.
[02:26.52]Sham, a noun, describes a fake, made-up situation.
[02:32.24]We use shams to cover up the truth.
[02:37.20]Let's hear some of these terms used in a short story.
[02:43.40]Two roommates work together at a bank.
[02:47.00]One day, they decide to steal all the gold and jewelry
[02:51.76]held in the bank's safe.
[02:54.04]So, they plot. They plan it out.
[02:57.56]First, they need an alibi.
[03:01.08]Where can they be while the robbery is actually happening?
[03:06.64]They create a bogus alibi.
[03:10.92]They tell police that at the time of the robbery,
[03:14.52]they were together at a volunteer event,
[03:18.16]cleaning up a local park by the town's river.
[03:23.16]But after checking out their alibi,
[03:25.92]police brought the two in for questioning.
[03:29.84]Then detectives searched their shared apartment
[03:33.00]and found all the gold and jewels from the bank robbery.
[03:38.56]What made the police suspect them?
[03:41.12]Can you guess what detectives found at the river park
[03:45.96]that proved their alibi was a sham?
[03:50.36]A dirty park and river!
[03:53.04]They both had a huge amount of trash!
[03:56.48]Clearly, no clean-up event had ever taken place.
[04:01.52]And that's all the time
[04:03.68]we have for this Words and Their Stories.
[04:06.44]Until next time ...
[04:08.12]I'm Anna Matteo.
