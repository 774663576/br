[00:01.16]At the Pyramids of Giza, a few tourists walk among Egypt's ancient wonders.
[00:09.52]At Red Sea resorts, visitor numbers are well below what they were in earlier years.
[00:18.76]Coronavirus cases in Egypt remain under control.
[00:24.60]But, officials, hotel owners and tour guides agree that the tourism season,
[00:33.24]starting in October, is going to be difficult.
[00:37.72]That could be bad news for the economy.
[00:42.12]Tourism makes up to around 15 percent of Egypt's economy.
[00:48.84]Officials said the economy was losing around $1 billion each month
[00:54.84]after tourism mostly stopped in March.
[00:59.36]Since July 1, 220,000 tourists have visited the Red Sea province and South Sinai,
[01:09.64]which is home to the Sharm el-Sheikh resort.
[01:14.88]That number represents less than 10 percent of last year's levels,
[01:20.72]said Ghada Shalaby, a deputy minister at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.
[01:29.04]Egypt has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
[01:34.08]for $8 billion in new loans this year.
[01:39.36]Samir is a trader who has been working at the pyramids south of Cairo for around 30 years.
[01:48.80]"We used to see about 50 buses here. Now there are none," he said.
[01:55.96]He has been selling his possessions to pay for his son's school fees.
[02:02.16]"We only had one bus, a week ago, full of Russians. They took some photos and left."
[02:11.60]Westerners often come to see Egypt's historic sites
[02:16.08]and golden sands between October and May.
[02:20.88]They want to avoid the cold at home and the heat of Egypt's summer.
[02:27.20]Shalaby said visitors are slowly returning to the resorts by the sea.
[02:33.68]But Shalaby said that safety was more important than increasing tourism numbers.
[02:40.84]Nile cruises will likely begin in October,
[02:45.52]but it is unlikely that bookings will pick up without a return of charter flights.
[02:53.40]"We hope that next year tourism will be working,"
[02:57.56]said Tharwat Agamy of the Egyptian Travel Agents Association.
[03:04.88]The Egyptian government has moved to protect the tourism industry with emergency financing.
[03:12.96]More than 9,000 tour guides will receive $32 monthly until the end of the year.
[03:21.72]Officially recorded daily coronavirus cases have fallen to under 200

[03:42.76]Those entering the country are required to take PCR tests, a special kind of medical test.
[03:51.88]But the European Union has not added Egypt to its safe travel list.
[03:59.12]At Cairo's Khan al Khalili market, a popular place for tourists, many stores are closed.
[04:07.56]"There is no one," said Sayed Abdel Khaleq, a silver shop owner.
