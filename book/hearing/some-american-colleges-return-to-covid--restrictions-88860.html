[00:00.04]Many university students in the United States
[00:03.28]thought they would get through the final weeks of
[00:05.72]the 2021-2022 school year without another COVID-19 restriction.
[00:13.36]That is no longer the case for some.
[00:16.32]Major universities in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,
[00:22.80]Connecticut and Texas recently put pandemic restrictions back in place.
[00:28.72]Many are once again requiring face coverings.
[00:33.28]In Washington, D.C., Howard University moved its classes back online.
[00:40.28]At Rice University in Texas,
[00:43.44]leaders told students to cancel any large parties.
[00:49.08]These and other rules come about three weeks before many universities

[01:01.00]For some students, it is the third straight year of COVID-related restrictions.
