<p>South Korea's government has warned young doctors to return to work before February 29 or face possible punishments.
韩国政府警告年轻医生在2月29日之前返回工作岗位，否则可能面临惩罚。</p>
<p>About 9,000 young doctors started walking off the job early last week to protest a government plan to increase the number of students accepted to medical schools.
上周早些时候，约9000名年轻医生开始离职，以抗议政府扩大医学生招生人数的计划。</p>
<p>The doctors are in the early part of their careers. They are known as residents or interns. These young professionals generally assist or observe more experienced doctors in their work.<br/>
这些医生正处于职业生涯的早期阶段。他们被称为住院医生或实习生。这些年轻的专业人员通常在工作中协助或观察更有经验的医生。</p>
<p>The government wants to expand the yearly number of new medical student admissions by 2,000. The plan also offers incentives to doctors if they specialize in areas facing shortages, such as doctors who treat children or work in emergency rooms.<br/>
政府希望将每年新招收的医学生人数增加2000人。该计划还为专门从事面临短缺领域的医生提供激励，例如在儿科或急诊室工作的医生。</p>
<p>Officials have said the plan is necessary to serve South Korea's aging population. The country's current doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the developed world.<br/>
官员们表示，这项计划是服务韩国老龄化人口所必需的。该国目前的医患比例是发达国家中最低的。</p>
<p>But the striking doctors say the nation's universities are unprepared to deal with additional students. They have also said the change would not solve doctor shortages in some areas of the profession.<br/>
但罢工的医生们表示，韩国的大学没有做好应对新增学生的准备。他们还表示，这一改变不会解决该行业某些领域的医生短缺问题。</p>
<p>
Under South Korean law, the government can order doctors and other medical workers back to work if there is a major risk to public health. Refusal to obey such an order can result in the suspension of licenses and up to three years in prison or a $22,480 fine. Those who receive prison sentences would have their medical licenses canceled.<br/>
根据韩国法律，如果公众健康面临重大风险，政府可以命令医生和其他医务工作者重返工作岗位。拒绝遵守此类命令可能导致执照被吊销、最高三年监禁或22480美元罚款。那些被判入狱的人士将被吊销行医执照。</p>
<p>South Korea's Vice Health Minister, Park Min-soo, told reporters Monday the government would not seek any punishments against striking doctors who returned by February 29. "If they return to the hospitals they had left by then, we won't hold them responsible" for any damage caused, Park said. He added, "It's not too late. Please, return to patients immediately."<br/>
韩国保健福祉部副部长朴敏守星期一告诉记者，政府不会寻求对2月29日前返岗的罢工医生施加任何惩罚。朴敏守说，“如果他们回到当时离开的医院，我们不会对他们造成的任何损失的追究责任。”他补充道：“现在还不算太晚。请立即回到病人身边。”</p>
<p>The government said those who do not return to work by the end of the month could be punished with at least a three-month suspension of their medical licenses. Doctors who continue to strike could also face additional legal steps and possible court trials.<br/>
政府表示，月底之前没有返岗的人士可能会被处以吊销医疗执照至少三个月的处罚。继续罢工的医生还可能面临额外的法律措施和可能的法庭审判。</p>
<p>Hyeondeok Choi is a partner at the law firm Daeryun, which specializes in medical law. He told the Associated Press it would be highly unlikely the government would suspend the licenses of all striking doctors because of the possible harm that could cause. Some industry observers said a more likely action would be for the government to only punish strike leaders.<br/>
崔德贤是Daeyun律师事务所的合伙人，他专攻医疗法。他告诉美联社，政府极不可能因为可能造成的伤害而暂停所有罢工医生的执照。一些行业观察人士表示，政府更可能采取的行动是只惩罚罢工领头人。</p>
<p>The AP reports there are about 13,000 medical interns and residents working in South Korea. These workers represent about 30 to 40 percent of all the doctors at some major hospitals.<br/>
据美联社报道，韩国约有13000名实习医生和住院医生。这些人员在一些大医院约占所有医生人数的30%到40%。</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the government announced it would permit universities to admit 2,000 more medical students starting next year. Officials say the plan calls for adding up to 10,000 new doctors by 2035.<br/>
本月早些时候，政府宣布将允许大学从明年开始多招收2000名医学生。官员们表示，该计划要求到2035年新增1万名医生。</p>
<p>Public opinion studies have shown that about 80 percent of South Koreans support the government's plan. But striking doctors have said they worry that doctors facing increased competition could start treating patients for conditions they do not have. This, they added, could put new financial pressures on the country's medical system, which would have to pay for the additional costs.<br/>
民意调查显示，大约80%的韩国人支持政府的计划。但罢工医生表示，他们担心医生面临日益激烈竞争，可能会开始对患者进行过度治疗。他们补充道，这可能会给该国的医疗系统带来新的财政压力，该系统将不得不支付额外的费用。</p>
<p>Critics have noted doctors currently receive one of the highest pay rates of any workers in South Korea. They argue that increasing numbers creates greater competition and can lower doctor incomes.<br/>
批评人士指出，目前医生的工资是韩国所有职工中最高的。他们认为，人数的增加会带来更大的竞争，并可能降低医生的收入。</p>
<p>Vice Health Minister Park said the country's services for emergency and critical patients remain stable. He noted that public hospitals had extended their working hours and military hospitals were opening their emergency rooms to civilian patients.<br/>
韩国保健福祉部副部长朴表示，韩国的急诊和危重症患者服务保持稳定。他指出，公立医院延长了工作时间，同时军队医院向平民患者开放了急诊室。</p>

。
[00:00.04]South Korea's government has warned
[00:03.24]young doctors to return to work
[00:06.76]before February 29
[00:09.36]or face possible punishments.
[00:12.64]About 9,000 young doctors
[00:15.84]started walking off the job early last week
[00:19.92]to protest a government plan
[00:23.00]to increase the number of students
[00:26.00]accepted to medical schools.
[00:28.92]The doctors are in the early part of their careers.
[00:33.48]They are known as residents or interns.
[00:36.92]These young professionals generally assist
[00:40.88]or observe more experienced doctors in their work.
[00:46.12]The government wants to expand the yearly number
[00:50.52]of new medical student admissions by 2,000.
[00:54.76]The plan also offers incentives to doctors
[00:59.80]if they specialize in areas facing shortages,
[01:04.40]such as doctors who treat children
[01:07.36]or work in emergency rooms.
[01:10.00]Officials have said the plan is necessary
[01:14.44]to serve South Korea's aging population.
[01:18.48]The country's current doctor-to-patient ratio
[01:23.16]is among the lowest in the developed world.
[01:27.28]But the striking doctors say the nation's universities
[01:32.56]are unprepared to deal with additional students.
[01:37.44]They have also said the change
[01:40.08]would not solve doctor shortages
[01:43.08]in some areas of the profession.
[01:46.08]Under South Korean law,
[01:49.04]the government can order doctors
[01:51.56]and other medical workers back to work
[01:55.28]if there is a major risk to public health.
[01:58.96]Refusal to obey such an order
[02:02.48]can result in the suspension of licenses
[02:06.20]and up to three years in prison or a $22,480 fine.
[02:14.68]Those who receive prison sentences
[02:18.04]would have their medical licenses canceled.
[02:21.64]South Korea's Vice Health Minister, Park Min-soo,
[02:26.52]told reporters Monday the government
[02:29.68]would not seek any punishments
[02:32.12]against striking doctors
[02:34.60]who returned by February 29.
[02:38.52]"If they return to the hospitals they had left by then,
[02:43.44]we won't hold them responsible"
[02:46.08]for any damage caused, Park said.
[02:50.08]He added, "It's not too late.
[02:52.88]Please, return to patients immediately."
[02:56.68]The government said those
[02:59.04]who do not return to work
[03:01.00]by the end of the month could be punished
[03:04.20]with at least a three-month suspension
[03:07.28]of their medical licenses.
[03:09.88]Doctors who continue to strike
[03:12.88]could also face additional legal steps
[03:16.52]and possible court trials.
[03:19.28]Hyeondeok Choi is a partner at the law firm Daeryun,

[03:27.88]He told the Associated Press
[03:30.76]it would be highly unlikely the government

[03:38.56]because of the possible harm that could cause.
[03:42.52]Some industry observers said a more likely action
[03:47.20]would be for the government
[03:49.12]to only punish strike leaders.
[03:52.20]The AP reports there are about 13,000 medical interns
[03:59.00]and residents working in South Korea.
[04:02.72]These workers represent about 30 to 40 percent
[04:07.68]of all the doctors at some major hospitals.
[04:12.04]Earlier this month, the government announced
[04:15.76]it would permit universities to admit 2,000
[04:19.84]more medical students starting next year.
[04:23.88]Officials say the plan calls
[04:27.04]for adding up to 10,000 new doctors by 2035.
[04:32.96]Public opinion studies have shown
[04:36.20]that about 80 percent of South Koreans
[04:39.88]support the government's plan.
[04:42.84]But striking doctors have said they worry
[04:46.92]that doctors facing increased competition
[04:50.64]could start treating patients
[04:52.80]for conditions they do not have.
[04:55.56]This, they added, could put new financial pressures
[05:00.60]on the country's medical system,
[05:03.12]which would have to pay for the additional costs.
[05:06.88]Critics have noted doctors
[05:09.92]currently receive one of the highest pay rates
[05:13.56]of any workers in South Korea.
[05:16.48]They argue that increasing numbers
[05:20.08]creates greater competition
[05:22.72]and can lower doctor incomes.
[05:26.00]Vice Health Minister Park
[05:28.56]said the country's services for emergency
[05:32.60]and critical patients remain stable.
[05:36.44]He noted that public hospitals
[05:39.28]had extended their working hours
[05:42.04]and military hospitals
[05:44.44]were opening their emergency rooms
[05:47.40]to civilian patients.
