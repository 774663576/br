[00:00.04]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.92]from VOA Learning English.
[00:15.08]On this program, we explore words and expressions
[00:23.84]in the English language.
[00:26.60]We give definitions, examples
[00:29.72]and sometimes notes on usage.
[00:34.76]Have you ever found yourself in a group of people
[00:38.80]with similar ways of thinking and interests to yours?
[00:43.52]They understand you. They really get you.
[00:48.44]They may even be wearing similar clothing to yours.
[00:53.88]We have a great expression for this:
[00:57.12]Birds of a feather flock together.
[01:01.04]This means people of the same kind
[01:04.04]or with the same tastes and interests
[01:07.48]often find each other.
[01:10.76]Artists may spend time with other artists.
[01:15.44]Lawyers often talk about legal issues
[01:18.48]or court cases with other lawyers.
[01:22.80]And people who love languages
[01:25.56]like to discuss grammar and words
[01:28.72]with other language-loving people.
[01:33.12]We have many similar expressions,
[01:35.76]and many of them use the word "mind" or "brain."
[01:41.12]If someone thinks like me,
[01:43.56]I can say we are like-minded.
[01:46.68]I can also say we are of like mind or of the same mind.
[01:54.12]There is also something called a hive mind.
[01:58.96]In a beehive, the bees all work together
[02:02.52]to achieve the same goal.
[02:05.88]People who are part of a hive mind
[02:08.92]have similar thoughts, ideas, and opinions.
[02:14.04]They often work together
[02:15.84]to discuss an issue or solve a problem.
[02:20.48]And sometimes, I can joke
[02:22.76]that I share the same brain
[02:24.52]with those who share my thinking and attitudes.
[02:29.24]If you a spiritual kind of person,
[02:32.56]you can call them your kindred spirits.
[02:37.20]If you are more of a science person,
[02:40.08]you can say you are on the same wavelength.
[02:44.76]And if you are a person who likes to make things,
[02:48.32]you can use these two expressions:
[02:53.04]cut from the same cloth, cast from the same mold.
[02:57.24]All these expressions mean the same thing --
[03:00.24]you feel a strong connection to someone
[03:03.36]and feel very similar to them.
[03:07.40]We have another expression
[03:09.16]that can also be used in this situation.
[03:12.44]But we only use it
[03:14.48]when we have a similar idea with another person:
[03:18.44]great minds think alike.
[03:22.20]If you often listen to VOA Learning English,
[03:25.72]you belong to a community of like-minded people:
[03:29.56]People who want to practice their English.
[03:32.64]Welcome to our family!
[03:35.12]Until next time ... 
[03:36.52]I'm Anna Matteo.
