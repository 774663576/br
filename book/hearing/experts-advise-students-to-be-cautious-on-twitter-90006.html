[00:00.04]Businessman Elon Musk
[00:02.12]became the owner of Twitter just three weeks ago.
[00:05.40]And many people have been concerned about the future
[00:09.32]of the social media company ever since.
[00:12.84]Alexandra Roberts is a law and media professor
[00:18.44]at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:22.68]She had this to say:
[00:24.84]"I have been a really active Twitter user for a long time
[00:28.16]and I have made fantastic connections there
[00:31.12]that have helped with my scholarship and with my teaching.
[00:33.76]And also, I've been able to learn from a lot of other people
[00:36.48]and I've been able to build a network.
[00:38.84]And I've gotten a lot of opportunities there as well."
[00:42.16]Since Musk took over, Roberts said,
[00:46.12]"everything kind of went haywire."
[00:49.56]Haywire means something that is out of control or not working.
[00:54.92]She noted that Twitter may no longer be
[00:58.92]as safe a space as in the past.
[01:03.16]There is less certainty that people are who they say they are.
[01:09.08]Shortly after his takeover of Twitter, Musk started a service
[01:13.80]that permitted anyone willing to pay $8 a month
[01:17.44]to get a "verified" account.
[01:21.20]In the past, a verified account was only available to the government,
[01:27.60]companies, reporters, and well-known figures verified by Twitter.
[01:34.80]Someone then set up a verified account
[01:37.60]with the name of the drug company Eli Lilly.
[01:41.64]The account sent out a tweet saying its insulin drug
[01:47.00]which helps people with diabetes would be free.
[01:51.28]The false tweet forced the real company to post an apology.
[01:58.08]Others set up false accounts
[02:00.88]under the names of well-known politicians and athletes
[02:05.36]and even Musk's own companies of Tesla and SpaceX.
[02:11.04]The service, called Twitter Blue, has since been suspended.
[02:17.56]Musk also cut half of Twitter's workforce.
[02:21.36]And changes in the service
[02:24.28]made some important employees decide to leave.
[02:28.96]The developments concern people
[02:31.20]who have used the service for 16 years.
[02:34.92]Already, people are leaving Twitter
[02:37.96]and companies are pulling back advertisements.
[02:42.12]A 2018 study published in PLOS One
[02:46.08]says Twitter has played an important role
[02:49.24]"in the discovery of scholarly information
[02:52.40]and cross-disciplinary knowledge spreading."
[02:56.16]The study also says people use the service
[02:59.92]to share real-time information and make connections.
[03:05.48]Roberts agreed that Twitter has been a good service
[03:09.56]for professors and students to connect with those
[03:13.48]who have similar work or school interests.
[03:16.64]During the COVID-19 pandemic,
[03:19.60]instead of going to large business events,
[03:22.80]people stayed home and were able to use Twitter to stay connected.
[03:27.48]But Roberts added that the service
[03:30.64]"just became a lot less safe" and "this might be a time
[03:35.08]when people want to be more careful about what they share."
[03:39.64]Roberts said it is probably a good idea
[03:43.44]for people to "back up" all the information they have on Twitter.
[03:47.60]She suggested students add other services,
[03:51.04]such as email or LinkedIn,
[03:53.56]to stay in touch with their contacts.
[03:56.96]"You don't need to necessarily move things completely offline.
[04:00.28]But once you make a connection, it's smart to have
[04:04.08]some other way to continue that conversation with that person."
[04:09.36]Roy Gutterman teaches Media Law at Syracuse University in New York state.
[04:15.00]He advised students to be cautious
[04:17.80]and make sure that information was from "trusted sources."
[04:21.60]On Twitter, Gutterman said it is a good idea to look at
[04:26.04]who is following an account to determine whether it is real.
[04:31.36]He said technology has made it easier for people to share and connect,
[04:36.92]but that they should be prepared for changes.
[04:41.32]"Cyberspace is littered with all sorts of dead entities,

[04:49.20]Maybe the next major social media outlet is in gestation right now
[04:54.24]and will be born or maybe people will go back to Facebook."
[04:57.12]And Roberts added that students who use Twitter
[05:00.56]to look for jobs or opportunities should "get what you need …
