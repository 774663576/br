[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:04.80]A new report says income inequality 
[00:09.27]is hurting the potential for growth around the world. 
[00:13.16]It says the best way to deal with the inequality -- or lack of fairness -- 
[00:19.99]is by helping poor people and the middle class.
[00:23.79]The report is based on an International Monetary Fund study. 
[00:29.14]It examined the issue of income inequality: 
[00:32.73]the differences in wealth between the rich and everyone else.
[00:38.09]Opinions about income inequality are not hard to find. 
[00:42.87]Many people are concerned about the issue. 
[00:47.51]Kalpana Kochhar is Deputy Director of Strategy, 
[00:52.17]Policy and Review Department at the IMF. 
[00:56.30]On Monday, she said, 
[00:59.33]"The gap between the rich and the poor 
[01:02.24]is at the highest level in decades in advanced countries, 
[01:07.26]and inequality is also rising in major emerging markets."
[01:13.74]The new report is called "Causes and Consequences of Income Inequality: 
[01:21.49]A Global Perspective."  
[01:24.27]Ms. Kochhar said, inequality trends have been mixed 
[01:28.92]in emerging markets and developing countries. 
[01:32.99]Some countries are experiencing falling inequality rates, 
[01:38.32]with poor people and the middle class making gains. 
[01:42.80]However, pervasive inequities in education, health care, 
[01:49.10]and finance remain in areas such as Latin America, Middle East and Africa.
[01:56.86]The report suggested that policymakers 
[02:01.55]direct their attention on the poor and middle class. 
[02:06.01]That is because they are the major force for economic growth -- 
[02:11.11]or an increase in a country's gross domestic product, or GDP. 
[02:17.22]The GDP is the value of all the finished goods 
[02:22.31]and services produced within the country.
[02:25.33]The organizers of the study disputed the main idea  
[02:30.10]of what has been called "trickle down" economic theory. 
[02:33.91]The theory states that economic benefits provided 
[02:38.45]to the wealthy will indirectly help everyone else. 
[02:42.29]The idea is that money and other financial resources will "trickle down" to them.
[02:49.66]The IMF study, however, shows the opposite is true. 
[02:55.43]It found that a one percent increase in the earnings 
[02:59.83]of the richest 20 percent of people  
[03:03.06]led to a nearly one percent decrease in GDP growth over a five-year period. 
[03:10.08]An increase in the income share of the poorest 20 percent, 
[03:14.68]the study found, led to more than a one-third percent increase in GDP.
[03:20.79]Kalpana Kochhar said this means that directing policy 
[03:26.58]to the poor and middle class is good for growth. 
[03:30.46]She said this means that ending poverty could also improve growth prospects for all. 
[03:38.20]She said that is "a fairly powerful message" 
[03:42.09]for policymakers and researchers around the world.
[03:46.43]The report said there is no single program that will succeed in all countries. 
[03:53.57]It said the difference in income levels can have different reasons. 
[03:59.23]The report urged governments to find ways to solve the problem 
[04:04.49]that are specific to their own countries and institutions.
[04:10.60]And that's the Economics Report. I'm Mario Ritter.
