<p>Being burned out means a person has become very physically and emotionally tired after doing a difficult job for a long time.</p>
<p>A recent opinion study by the Rand Corporation found that twice as many <strong>principals </strong>and teachers reported <strong>frequent </strong>job-related stress as other working adults.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted a similar study that came from a coalition of mental health organizations in New Orleans. It found educators working during the COVID-19 pandemic reported rates of emotional difficulties similar to those of health care workers.

<p>Leigh Mclean is the main investigator at the Teacher Emotions, Characteristics, and Health Lab at the University of Delaware School of Education. She said, "It's all <strong>pretty</strong> bad."</p>
<p>She found levels of depression, anxiety, and emotional tiredness among elementary school teachers that are 100 to 400 percent higher than before the pandemic.</p>
<p>She said those problems are increasing the most among less experienced teachers. She said she recognized similarities between teachers and the general population "with underrepresented groups being hit the hardest..."</p>
<p>Some districts have or are planning to spend federal COVID-19 aid money on teacher mental health. They hope it might improve the classroom environment, keep teachers on the job and help students. Nebraska and Pennsylvania are among the states choosing teacher mental health as a top goal.</p>
<p>A Delaware school district hired two social and emotional learning experts who deal with problems teachers are having in the classroom.</p>

<p>One program aimed at improving mental health is Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education, or CARE.
