<p>Considering that an albatross can fly seemingly without effort, it is a bit surprising how we use the word in conversations.</p>
<p>An albatross describes something – a burden – that weighs heavily on us and prevents us from accomplishing something. It can be a problem that does not go away. This problem makes it difficult or impossible to do or achieve something.</p>

<p>For example: <em>Her never-ending search for <strong>fame</strong> and <strong>fortune</strong> became an <u>albatross</u> to a normal, happy life.</em></p>

<p>In Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 1798 poem <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>, a sailor kills an albatross that had been following his ship. As punishment and proof that he killed the bird, the crew hung the large seabird from the sailor's neck.</p>

。
[00:07.52]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:10.96]from VOA Learning English.
[00:14.44]On this program
[00:21.12]we explore words and expressions in the English language.
[00:25.84]We give examples, notes on usage,
[00:29.12]and sometimes we use them in short conversations.
[00:34.56]Many English expressions come from the world of animals.
[00:40.20]And, today we talk about a seabird
[00:43.68]called an albatross.
[00:46.92]An albatross is a large web-footed seabird.
[00:51.08]In fact, this family of seabirds
[00:54.84]includes some of the largest.
[00:58.88]They have long thin wings
[01:01.96]and are excellent gliders.
[01:05.32]To glide means to move smoothly,
[01:08.72]silently, and effortlessly.
[01:13.04]Considering that an albatross
[01:15.40]can fly seemingly without effort,
[01:18.40]it is a bit surprising
[01:20.84]how we use the word in conversations.
[01:24.84]An albatross describes something – a burden –
[01:28.32]that weighs heavily on us
[01:30.76]and prevents us from accomplishing something.
[01:35.64]It can be a problem that does not go away.
[01:40.60]This problem makes it difficult
[01:43.60]or impossible to do or achieve something.
[01:49.48]An albatross can also be something that gets in our way –
[01:53.68]a roadblock that keeps us from getting what we want.
[01:58.80]It hinders us.
[02:01.20]Or if you prefer the noun –
[02:03.92]it is a hinderance to our success
[02:07.36]or to our ability to be happy.
[02:11.44]Some describe an albatross as a mental burden.
[02:17.72]For example: Her never-ending search
[02:21.40]for fame and fortune
[02:23.36]became an albatross to a normal, happy life.
[02:28.32]Here is another example:
[02:30.56]His albatross was his huge credit card debt.
[02:35.32]It weighed heavily on every decision he made.
[02:40.44]So, how did the name of this large, graceful bird
[02:44.96]come to have this meaning?
[02:48.20]On Merriam-Webster's online dictionary,
[02:51.32]experts explain that this usage of the word
[02:55.84]comes from European sea mythology.
[03:00.32]Albatrosses are known for following ships at sea.
[03:04.76]They can glide for long periods of time
[03:08.60]without flapping their wings.
[03:12.28]So, some sailors had superstitious beliefs about the birds.
[03:17.80]A superstition is a belief that certain things
[03:22.20]or events will bring good or bad luck.
[03:27.60]In Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 1798 poem
[03:32.08]The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,
[03:34.56]a sailor kills an albatross
[03:37.28]that had been following his ship.
[03:40.52]As punishment and proof that he killed the bird,
[03:44.48]the crew hung the large seabird from the sailor's neck.
[03:49.00]To this day, the albatross remains a symbol
[03:53.44]for something that causes extreme guilt
[03:56.60]or something that is a great burden.
[04:00.88]And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories.
[04:04.84]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.
