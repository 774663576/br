<p>On Scotland's Isle of Skye, scientists have identified two areas with evidence of ancient life forms.</p>
<p>Researchers believe the markings are, in fact, footprints from dinosaurs that lived 170 million years ago. They say the prints date to the middle of the Jurassic Period, a time from which few dinosaur <strong>fossils</strong> have been recovered.</p>
<p>Researchers reported this month on their study of about 50 fossilized footprints at the two sites. The markings are just a few hundred meters apart from each other. They are said to show dinosaurs walking in different directions.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Steve Brusatte and Paige dePolo on the Isle of Skye" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/98AE517E-B52A-4DBE-A7E1-D4F786AA19CA_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Steve Brusatte and Paige dePolo on the Isle of Skye</span></div>
<p>At least three kinds of dinosaurs left the footprints.</p>
<p>Steve Brusatte, the leader of the research team, is a <strong>paleontologist</strong> with the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>"The <strong>tracks</strong> are located on flat rocky surfaces near the <strong>beach</strong>, so they are only <strong>exposed</strong> at low tide," he said. "The tide <strong>laps</strong> across them, back and forth, every day."</p>
<p>One set of markings came from a two-legged, meat-eating dinosaur that researchers say was about the size of a car. They say its footprints have three <strong>toes</strong>. The creature, with sharp <strong>claws</strong>, appears to be from a group of dinosaurs called theropods.</p>
<p>Bigger, three-toed footprints came from large-bodied, two-legged plant-eaters called ornithopods or perhaps, the researchers say, a large theropod. All of these prints had worn-down toes, not sharp edges.</p>
<p>The researchers are especially interested in markings left by another creature: an early member of a group of heavily built, four-legged plant-eaters called stegosaurs.</p>
<p>The footprints represent some of the oldest evidence anywhere of a stegosaur, notes Paige dePolo, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>DePolo was the lead writer of a report on the study. The findings were published in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>
<p>The most famous member of the stegosaurs was Stegosaurus, which lived late in the Jurassic Period. It had large, bony protective plates around the neck and back - and a large <strong>spiked</strong> tail, too.</p>
<p>Brusatte was careful to note that the researchers still have a lot of unanswered questions about this creature.</p>
<p>"I suspect this stegosaur was about the size of a cow, which is fairly small for a stegosaur. Whether that's because it's a primitive, smaller species or a juvenile of a bigger species, we're not sure," he said. </p>
<p>The researchers noted that the findings were an important window into the many kinds of dinosaurs on the Isle of Skye.</p>
<p>"Skye has emerged as one of the most important windows into Jurassic dinosaur <strong>evolution</strong>. We know that dinosaurs were diversifying with a <strong>frenzy</strong> in the Middle Jurassic, but there are few fossil sites of this age anywhere in the world," Brusatte added.</p>
