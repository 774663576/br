[00:01.68]A new study suggests ancient corals
[00:05.24]found deep in the ocean
[00:07.40]were the first animals to glow in the dark.
[00:11.00]To glow means to shine a steady light.
[00:16.16]Many animals, insects and sea life
[00:19.84]have the ability to glow.
[00:22.88]But a study from biologists based in the United States
[00:27.84]suggests corals started glowing 540 million years ago.
[00:34.60]Andrea Quattrini is curator of corals
[00:39.44]at the Smithsonian Museum 
[00:41.32]of Natural History in Washington, D.C.
[00:44.64]She was one of the writers of the study.
[00:48.04]Quattrini said the ability to light up
[00:51.72]helps creatures living in the deep-sea to communicate.
[00:56.20]"It's very important in deep waters," Quattrini said.
[00:59.92]The new study recently appeared
[01:02.56]in the publication Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
[01:08.12]Scientists know about many ocean animals that light up,
[01:12.24]including fish, squid, octopus, jellyfish and even sharks.
[01:19.60]The ability to glow is called bioluminescence,
[01:23.52]it comes from a chemical reaction.
[01:27.80]Some animals use the light as protection.
[01:30.64]Others use it to find a mate.
[01:34.36]Steven Haddock is another study co-writer.
[01:37.44]He is a marine biologist
[01:39.88]at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.
[01:45.32]He explained that scientists used a paintbrush
[01:49.96]attached to an underwater vehicle
[01:53.64]to lightly touch the luminous coral.
[01:57.64]Haddock said the coral, when touched,
[02:00.24]begins to glow pink, orange, white, blue and purple.
[02:06.48]Danielle DeLeo is another study co-writer
[02:09.72]and a marine biologist at the Smithsonian.
[02:13.32]She said in some kinds of coral,
[02:16.24]the whole body glows.
[02:18.60]In others, "only parts of their branches will glow," she said.
[02:23.84]Scientists do not fully know the function of the glowing for coral.
[02:29.52]They do not know if it is meant to attract
[02:32.32]or keep away certain organisms, or possibly both.
[02:36.76]But DeLeo said the fact that corals
[02:40.56]light up so often means
[02:42.12]that the glowing serves a critical function.
[02:46.40]It is one thing to try to learn about why the corals light up.
[02:50.48]But how did the researchers determine
[02:53.20]that coral had been glowing for over 500 million years?
[02:57.76]To answer the question,
[02:59.68]the scientists built a family tree
[03:02.88]using genetic data from 185 species of glowing coral.
[03:08.88]They decided the common ancestor
[03:11.64]of all the glowing coral lived 540 million years ago
[03:16.84]and could glow just like the current coral.
[03:20.92]Before this research, marine scientists believed
[03:25.48]the earliest example of a glowing sea creature
[03:28.80]was a shrimp that lived about 270 million years ago.
[03:34.48]Coming up with an age of the earliest glowing coral
[03:38.28]helps add more information
[03:40.16]to the timeline of the development of life on Earth.
[03:44.72]The oldest glowing coral
[03:46.80]is now placed in the time of the Cambrian explosion,
[03:50.92]when life on Earth developed quickly.
