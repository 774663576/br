<p>The agency said there are several ways to maintain healthy indoor air quality. These include controlling pollutants, ventilating outdoor air, and maintaining temperature and water in the air, or its humidity.</p>
<p>A 2022 international <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222009202">study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Building Engineering </em>said thousands of American schools have outdated HVAC systems.

<p>Indoor air quality might affect school performance. Some studies say that a healthy school environment lifts attendance, increases test scores and improves learning. A <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30061">study</a> of 10,000 school districts from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that decreased pollution in schools led to higher test scores.</p>
<p>Many schools have not taken steps to improve ventilation although research suggests it is important. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had recommended four ways to improve ventilation in schools. They included simple changes like opening windows and using fans to maintain airflow in buildings. Costly recommendations included replacing HVAC systems, using in-room air cleaners, or installing ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) devices.</p>
<p>Scientists and public health leaders pushed school districts to use federal pandemic emergency money for ventilation systems.

<p>In January, the EPA announced $32 million in <strong>grant</strong> funding to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases at schools in poor communities.
