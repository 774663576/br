[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]In India, government efforts to reform the economy have slowed. 
[00:05.58]The reason: the political opposition is blocking the passage of legislation through parliament.
[00:13.66]For more than two weeks, India's political opposition has blocked action in parliament. 
[00:20.35]Opposition members are demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
[00:25.45]dismiss his foreign minister and two state leaders. 
[00:29.72]The targeted officials are accused of corruption.
[00:34.50]Mr. Modi's government has refused to dismiss the ministers, 
[00:40.09]saying the accusations have not been proven.
[00:43.98]The dispute in parliament has almost ended the government's hopes 
[00:50.02]of passing legislation related to tax reform and land purchases in the current term.
[00:57.95]Dharmakirti Joshi is chief economist at the ratings agency Crisil in Mumbai. 
[01:05.18]He says these two bills were the centerpiece of the government's promise 
[01:11.51]to make India an easier place to do business.
[01:15.65]"What is happening in respect to both the bills is that there is delay and dilution of content. 
[01:24.73]If they don't get cleared, yes, 
[01:28.00]it will be a hit to the sentiment and it will constraint growth going ahead," he said.
[01:33.98]The tax reform bill is known as the Goods and Services Tax. 
[01:39.27]It aims to create a single market across India. 
[01:43.95]It would do this by replacing the many different taxes levied 
[01:49.43]by individual states with a single sales tax.
[01:53.76]The land bill would have made it easier for industry to acquire land to put up factories. 
[02:02.55]However, those plans have also been delayed after the opposition denounced them as "anti-farmer."
[02:11.77]Prime Minister Modi is having a difficult time passing laws 
[02:17.00]because his government does not command a majority in the upper house of parliament.
[02:23.13]Satish Misra studies Indian politics for the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 
[02:31.45]He blames the government for not doing enough to build ties with the opposition.
[02:38.43]"They will have to take the opposition on board, only then things will start moving...
[02:45.02]the government is not willing to concede even an inch to the opposition."
[02:50.11]The political impasse is affecting the Indian economy. 
[02:54.49]In a recent report, Moody's said the disputes are hurting business confidence – 
[03:01.27]how business leaders feel about current economic conditions. 
[03:06.36]The credit ratings agency added that the government's failure 
[03:11.69]to deliver promised reforms could slow growth.
[03:15.19]Prime Minister Modi came to power last year on the promise of restoring momentum to a slowing economy. 
[03:23.96]Growth has picked up, but the rate of change has been slower 
[03:29.79]than expected from a man who many had hoped would change India's business climate.
