。
[00:00.04]The earliest presidents who lived in the White House
[00:04.64]did not want the large outdoor areas
[00:08.32]that the monarchs of Europe might enjoy.
[00:12.92]Marta McDowell is writer of
[00:16.40]All the Presidents' Gardens.
[00:20.00]She said, "You can understand that,
[00:23.32]given our democratic form of government."
[00:27.60]But she said she thinks that a visit
[00:30.48]to the home of the British royal family,
[00:34.04]Buckingham Palace, caused President John Kennedy
[00:38.64]to expand the White House gardens.
[00:42.44]From the start, presidents and their families
[00:46.00]influenced the 7.2 hectares
[00:49.92]of open space in the front and back
[00:53.64]of the White House differently.
[00:56.88]Their choices often showed their values
[01:00.12]and traditions of their day.
[01:03.64]McDowell said that the White House
[01:06.16]is "really their home" while they are in office.
[01:12.04]She added that as long as they work
[01:14.92]with the historic plan of the gardens
[01:18.36]the National Park Service
[01:20.52]tries to meet the desires of the administration.
[01:25.44]The National Park Service oversees the gardens.
[01:30.60]John Quincy Adams, America's sixth president,
[01:35.20]worked in the garden.
[01:38.00]Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president,
[01:42.20]took down glass structures called greenhouses
[01:46.20]that were first built by James Buchanan,
[01:50.60]the 15th president, in the 1850s.
[01:55.56]John Kennedy, the 35th president,
[01:59.12]redesigned one garden
[02:01.12]called the Rose Garden in the 1960s.
[02:05.84]First lady Michelle Obama,
[02:08.32]wife of the 44th president,
[02:11.24]built a food garden using plants and seeds
[02:15.40]from the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president.
[02:21.36]Today, the garden has more than
[02:24.52]50 kinds of vegetables.
[02:27.76]Pierre L'Enfant was the city planner
[02:31.00]and architect for America's first president, George Washington.
[02:37.88]At first, he planned for a 30-hectare presidential garden.
[02:44.16]However, as a believer in small government,
[02:48.36]Jefferson reduced the White House grounds
[02:51.88]to just 2 hectares.
[02:54.88]The gardens were expanded to the current 7.2 hectares
[03:01.24]Jefferson, like many Americans
[03:04.60]who had just freed themselves
[03:06.68]from a British monarch,
[03:08.80]was concerned about creating a new king.
[03:13.68]"Avoid palaces and gardens of palaces,"
[03:17.96]William Thornton, a Washington city representative warned.
[03:24.48]"If you build a palace with gardens,
[03:27.20]I will find you a king."
[03:30.16]Over time, several different plants and flowers
[03:33.84]were planted at the White House.
[03:37.36]They include roses which have been around
[03:40.68]since at least Jefferson's time.
[03:44.52]They also include peonies,
[03:46.80]wanted by first lady first lady Nancy Reagan
[03:50.36]of the 40th president, and Texas bluebells,
[03:55.00]asked for by first lady Laura Bush
[03:58.40]of the 43rd president.
[04:01.68]Oak and elm trees
[04:03.48]have also been on the White House grounds
[04:06.52]almost since the beginning.
[04:09.84]One tree, a chestnut oak
[04:12.44]southeast of the White House,
[04:14.84]might be the oldest tree on the grounds.
[04:19.16]The White House says it has been around since 1800.
[04:24.92]McDowell says the White House gardens
[04:27.92]represent gardening tradition over time.
[04:32.32]First it followed designs in Europe,
[04:35.40]and then it was shaped by local traditions,

[04:42.36]But she said, "It's not that they are always the leader.
[04:46.80]In fact, sometimes they're following."
[04:50.88]The White house grounds were open to the public
[04:53.96]up until 1923.
[04:57.64]That was when Calvin Coolidge,
[05:00.00]the 30th president,
[05:01.88]permanently closed them to unapproved visitors.
[05:07.08]These days, the White House Garden
[05:09.44]planned visits for the public
[05:12.08]are usually available for the public twice a year,
[05:16.84]one weekend in the spring
