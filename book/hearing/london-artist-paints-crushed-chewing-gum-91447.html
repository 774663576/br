。
[00:00.04]Lying on London's famous Millennium Bridge,
[00:04.72]British artist Ben Wilson paints on a piece of dried gum.
[00:09.92]It has been crushed flat into the ground.
[00:14.64]"The important thing is the gum is below the metal tread,"
[00:19.16]said the 60-year-old Wilson.
[00:22.20]"The beauty of it is they're all different shapes and sizes...,"
[00:27.72]he continued, describing pieces of gum.
[00:31.52]Wilson sees possibility in things most people avoid looking at.
[00:38.00]The flattened gum is a chance
[00:40.56]to turn a piece of waste into something beautiful.
[00:44.76]The artwork also is a way to surprise walkers
[00:49.64]and get them to take a closer look at the path they are on.
[00:55.56]"By painting a picture which is so small,
[00:58.64]those that see it then discover
[01:01.40]a hidden world beneath their feet," Wilson said.
[01:05.40]Back in his north London art room,
[01:08.84]Wilson paints on the surface of a small mosaic tile.
[01:14.08]It will be part of a collection
[01:16.84]that he is creating on the walls
[01:19.52]of London's Underground train platforms.
[01:23.36]The images are more personal
[01:26.24]than the chewing gum works, Wilson says,
[01:29.84]and represent a kind of "visual diary."
[01:34.00]"The pictures are a celebration of my life
[01:37.88]and those that I care dearly about," he said.
[01:41.96]"They are a process of visual inquiry -
[01:45.44]trying to make sense of the world," he added.
[01:49.80]Wilson was born in London to artist parents.
[01:54.68]He remembers working with clay from the age of three.
[01:59.96]He had his first art show when he was around 10 or 11 years old.
[02:06.24]He began making sculptures
[02:08.32]and large pieces for display in nature settings.
[02:12.88]Then his interest turned to waste, also called trash.
[02:17.96]He has been painting gum and other pieces of trash for 19 years.
[02:24.36]The top surface of the dried gum is not subject
[02:29.04]to local or national laws.
[02:31.28]As a result, the dried gum surface creates a space
[02:36.52]where Wilson says he can paint
[02:39.20]without damaging public property.
[02:42.24]"I found this little space where I could create a form of art
[02:47.16]where I could be spontaneous
[02:49.52]and do something which evolves
[02:51.92]out of the place in which it's created," Wilson said.
[02:56.64]Government officials have removed
[02:59.32]much of the artist's public street art.
[03:02.44]But the hundreds of gum paintings on Millennium Bridge
[03:06.76]remain for all to see.
