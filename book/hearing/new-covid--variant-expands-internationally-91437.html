<p>Tedros noted the latest data show that COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations are decreasing.

<p>Maria Van Kerkhove is with the WHO's Health Emergencies Program. She said that, as of last week, only about 10 cases of the BA.2.86 variant had been found worldwide.

<p>She said the WHO is currently trying to closely follow the movements of the latest virus variants.

<p>Some international scientists have said that while it is important to keep following BA.2.86, the variant was unlikely to cause a new, harmful wave of infections. This is because much of the population has built up defenses against COVID-19 because of vaccinations or previous infection.</p>
<p><strong>Testing new vaccines</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are currently testing how effective newly created COVID-19 vaccines will work against BA.2.86. Van Kerkhove noted that in the past, vaccines have been better at preventing severe sickness and death than blocking re-infections. U.S. health officials said earlier this month the latest COVID-19 vaccines are set to be released sometime in September.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) completed a risk report on the new variant last week. The report said BA.2.86 may be capable of causing infection in vaccinated people and those who had COVID-19 before. But officials noted there is so far no evidence that the new variant is causing more severe sickness than earlier ones.</p>
<p>The WHO said COVID-19 testing has dropped by 90 percent worldwide from the highest point of the pandemic. Testing rates have also fallen sharply in the U.S., and genetic <strong>sequencing</strong> is down by around 90 percent, said Dr. Ashish Jha. He served as the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator until June 2023.</p>
<p>Jha said data from hospital stays, emergency room visits, deaths, wastewater testing and sequencing efforts had given health officials improved information about current virus spread.</p>

[00:00.04]International health officials are closely following
[00:04.28]a new version of COVID-19
[00:07.12]as it spreads to more countries.
[00:10.76]The version, or variant, is called BA.2.86.
[00:18.00]Officials from the World Health Organization
[00:21.56](WHO) say it has already been identified in several countries,
[00:27.40]including the United States, Switzerland, South Africa,
[00:32.20]Israel, Denmark and Britain.
[00:34.88]WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

[02:09.64]The efforts include taking wastewater samples from different cities
