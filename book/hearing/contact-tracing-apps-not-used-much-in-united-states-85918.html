[00:00.04]Six months ago, Apple and Google released a new tool for smartphone users.
[00:07.48]The program, or app, informs users of their possible exposure
[00:14.76]to someone infected with COVID-19.
[00:18.68]However, an Associated Press examination shows
[00:23.72]that few people in the United States are using the app.
[00:28.64]The smartphone program is not widely available
[00:32.88]in most U.S. states and territories.
[00:37.16]Information from 16 states, Guam and the District of Columbia
[00:43.80]shows that 8.1 million people had used the technology as of late November.
[00:51.52]Around 110 million people live in those areas.
[00:57.16]Computer apps could help public health workers with contact tracing,
[01:03.24]a difficult job in pandemic control.
[01:07.28]Contact tracers search for individuals
[01:11.36]who may have come in contact with an infected person.
[01:15.88]The contact tracing tool is free and can be found in Apple's app store
[01:23.08]and the Google Play store for Android devices.
[01:28.04]Some state health-department websites
[01:31.36]also offer the program for downloading.
