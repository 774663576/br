<p>The size of the ship and the shoes seized Robert Ballard's attention when he saw the wreckage of the Titanic from a submarine deep below the sea.</p>
<p>"The first thing I saw coming out of the <strong>gloom</strong>...was this wall, this giant wall of...steel that rose over 100 and some <strong>feet</strong> above us," Ballard told the Associated Press. "I never looked down at the Titanic. I looked up at the Titanic. Nothing was small."</p>
<p>In 1986, Ballard and a group of explorers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution helped find the famous passenger ship.

[00:00.04]The size of the ship and the shoes
[00:04.04]seized Robert Ballard's attention
[00:06.88]when he saw the wreckage of the Titanic
[00:10.60]from a submarine deep below the sea.
[00:14.48]"The first thing I saw coming out of the gloom...was this wall,
[00:19.32]this giant wall of...steel that rose over 100 and some feet above us,"
[00:27.36]Ballard told the Associated Press.
[00:31.16]"I never looked down at the Titanic.
[00:34.16]I looked up at the Titanic. Nothing was small."
[00:40.08]In 1986, Ballard and a group of explorers
[00:44.76]from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
[00:48.56]helped find the famous passenger ship.
[00:52.60]The Titanic struck a huge piece of ice
[00:56.12]and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912.
[01:02.40]This week, Woods Hole released a video of the wreckage
[01:07.44]recorded by the explorers
[01:10.52]more than three kilometers below the ocean's surface.
[01:16.64]Ballard saw the Titanic's windows.
[01:19.96]"It was like people looking back at us.
[01:23.40]It was pretty haunting actually," he said.
[01:27.96]There were no human remains left, but he saw shoes,
[01:32.76]including what appeared to be the shoes of a mother and a baby.
[01:38.28]"After the Titanic sank, those that went into the water
[01:43.64]that didn't have lifejackets died of hypothermia
[01:48.08]and their bodies came raining down," he said.
[01:53.08]The Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg
[01:56.44]in the early morning hours of April 15, 1912.
[02:02.92]The vessel was on its first trip
[02:05.28]from Southampton, England, to New York City.
[02:10.16]The Woods Hole team, in partnership
[02:13.28]with the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea,
[02:18.76]discovered the final resting place of the ship
[02:22.36]in 3,780 meters of water on September 1, 1985,
[02:30.24]using an underwater camera.
[02:32.96]The newly released video
[02:35.56]was from a second research trip the following year.
[02:41.28]There had been earlier efforts to find the sunken ship.
[02:45.96]But the 1985 discovery and the 1986 trip
[02:51.48]were made possible by underwater vehicles
[02:55.32]that could withstand the severe conditions,
[02:58.96]said Woods Hole engineer Andy Bowen.
[03:04.76]"The water is near freezing temperatures
[03:07.44]and probably the biggest challenge
[03:10.24]is the remoteness of the location,
[03:13.08]and in particular the harsh environment with regard
