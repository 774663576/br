<p>Stephen Hawking, the most famous physicist of his time, has died at the age of 76.</p>
<p>A family spokesman said Hawking, who was British, died peacefully early Wednesday at his home in Cambridge, England.</p>
<p>Hawking was a theoretical physicist. He was known worldwide for working to explain subjects like the beginnings of the universe and the complexities of black holes.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with a disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, at age 21. At the time, doctors predicted he would only live a few years. But he proved them wrong by surviving for more than 50 years more and continuing his scientific work.</p>
<p>The disease eventually put him in a wheelchair and took away his ability to speak. For many years, Hawking communicated by using a voice <strong>synthesizer</strong>.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this March 6, 2017, file photo, Stephen Hawking receives the Honorary Freedom of the City of London. Cambridge University has put Hawking's doctoral thesis online " expanding="" of="" online.="" properties="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/21EFF4DC-7F0C-42C2-BD68-15049A7E9349_w268_r1.jpg" universes=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this March 6, 2017, file photo, Stephen Hawking receives the Honorary Freedom of the City of London. Cambridge University has put Hawking's doctoral thesis online "Properties of Expanding Universes" online.</span></div>
<p>In his 2013 book, "My Brief History," Hawking wrote about first learning of the illness: "I felt it was very unfair - why should this happen to me?" He added: "At the time, I thought my life was over and that I would never realize the <strong>potential</strong> I felt I had." "But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life," he wrote.</p>
<p>Hawking was one of Sir Isaac Newton's successors as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/professor-stephen-hawking-1942-2018" target="_blank">Cambridge University</a>. In this role, he was involved in the search for one of the great goals of physics – to find a "unified theory."</p>
<p>He studied Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which describes the movement of large objects. He sought to connect that theory with the Theory of Quantum Mechanics, which deals with subatomic <strong>particles</strong>.</p>
<p>"My goal is simple," Hawking once said. "It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all."</p><span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close"><span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>His 1988 book "A Brief History of Time" became an international bestseller and brought him widespread fame.</p>
<p>Hawking was also recognized for his successful research on black holes. He was able to prove that small amounts of <strong>radiation</strong> could escape black hole gravitational pull. His work led the discovery to become known as Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>A sign of his great popularity came in October 2017, when Cambridge put Hawking's 1966 <strong>thesis</strong> on the internet for the first time. Demand for the thesis was so high that it caused the university's website <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/whats-trending-stephen-hawking/4084553.html" target="_blank">to go down</a>.</p>
<p>Hawking said belief in a God who intervenes in the universe "to make sure the good guys win or get rewarded in the next life" was wishful thinking. "But one can't help asking the question: Why does the universe exist?" he said in 1991. "I don't know an operational way to give the question or the answer, if there is one, a meaning. But it <strong>bothers</strong> me."</p>
<p>Hawking was a big supporter of human space travel <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/stephen-hawking-calls-for-return-to-the-moon/3921943.html" target="_blank">to the Moon</a> and Mars. He said such missions would help unite humanity in a shared purpose of spreading the human race beyond Earth.</p>
<p>"We are running out of space and the only places to go to are other worlds. It is time to <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/hawking-zuckerberg-help-launch-search-for-life-in-the-universe/3287925.html" target="_blank">explore other solar systems</a>. Spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am <strong>convinced</strong> that humans need to leave the Earth," he said last year.</p>
