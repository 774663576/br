<p>Increased unemployment benefits and housing protections had ended earlier on Sunday. </p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, praised Trump for preventing "a government shutdown at a time when our nation could not have <strong>afforded</strong> one." He said the bill was not perfect but would do a huge amount of good for struggling Americans "who need help now."</p>
<p>Trump said in announcing the signing that he was also demanding changes to the legislation to remove what he called "wasteful <strong>items</strong>." Those demands amount to suggestions to Congress and will not necessarily result in any changes to the bill. </p>
<p>His main objection to the bill was the amount of individual coronavirus aid payments to Americans.</p>
<p>"As President, I have told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child," Trump said in a statement. </p>
<p>Trump's support for the larger payments was seen as criticism of members of his Republican Party who resisted Democratic efforts to negotiate larger payments. </p>
<p>Democrats have described the aid bill as just a first step in their push for a more expansive aid program. </p>
<p>"We need to ensure <strong>robust</strong> support for state and local government to <strong>distribute</strong> and administer a vaccine, keep workers employed and prevent <strong>devastating</strong> service cuts – and we must do so as soon as possible," Pelosi said.</p>
<p>Trump did veto a separate spending bill last week. The $740 billion measure would support the country's defense programs.</p>
<p>Congress has suspended its usual Christmas break to return to work to consider an override, or rejection, of Trump's veto. A two-thirds majority vote in both legislative bodies is required to override a presidential veto. </p>

。
[00:00.04]American President Donald Trump
[00:02.96]signed a $2.3 trillion spending plan measure Sunday night
[00:09.44]that he had suggested he would veto.
[00:13.44]The bill includes $900 billion for coronavirus aid
[00:19.88]and $1.4 trillion for government operations through next September.
[00:28.48]The president had called the bill "a disgrace"
[00:31.92]after the Senate passed it last week.
[00:35.88]His objections surprised many in Congress.
[00:40.04]Republican and Democratic leaders called on Trump
[00:44.76]throughout the week, urging him to sign it.
[00:49.24]Without Trump's signature or passage of a temporary measure,
[00:54.12]a partial government shutdown would have begun Tuesday.
[00:59.72]Increased unemployment benefits and housing protections
[01:04.04]had ended earlier on Sunday.
[01:07.72]House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, called the signing
[01:13.16]"welcomed news for the 14 million Americans
[01:17.92]who just lost the lifeline of unemployment benefits on Christmas Weekend,
[01:24.44]and for the millions more struggling to stay afloat
[01:29.44]during this historic pandemic and economic crisis."
[01:34.40]Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican,
[01:39.04]praised Trump for preventing "a government shutdown
[01:43.64]at a time when our nation could not have afforded one."
[01:49.52]He said the bill was not perfect but would do a huge amount of good
[01:55.24]for struggling Americans "who need help now."
[02:00.36]Trump said in announcing the signing
[02:02.88]that he was also demanding changes to the legislation
[02:07.56]to remove what he called "wasteful items."
[02:12.32]Those demands amount to suggestions to Congress
[02:16.24]and will not necessarily result in any changes to the bill.
[02:22.24]His main objection to the bill was the amount
[02:25.56]of individual coronavirus aid payments to Americans.
[02:30.44]"As President, I have told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending
[02:36.56]and more money going to the American people
[02:40.24]in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child,"
[02:47.92]Trump said in a statement.
[02:51.00]Trump's support for the larger payments was seen as criticism
[02:55.96]of members of his Republican Party
[02:58.68]who resisted Democratic efforts to negotiate larger payments.
[03:05.52]Democrats have described the aid bill as just a first step

[03:15.84]"We need to ensure robust support for state and local government
[03:20.80]to distribute and administer a vaccine,
[03:24.28]keep workers employed and prevent devastating service cuts
[03:30.56]– and we must do so as soon as possible," Pelosi said.
[03:36.32]Trump did veto a separate spending bill last week.
