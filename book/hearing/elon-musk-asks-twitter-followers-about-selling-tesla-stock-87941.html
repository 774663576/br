。
[00:00.04]Elon Musk, the founder of the electric car company Tesla,
[00:04.48]recently asked people on Twitter
[00:07.12]if he should sell billions of dollars in company stock.
[00:12.08]Musk is one of the world’s richest people,
[00:15.28]so the request was unusual.
[00:19.56]He asked his millions of Twitter followers
[00:23.28]whether he should sell 10 percent of his stock in the company.
[00:28.80]That amount might be worth $20 billion or more.
[00:34.28]As of last summer, Musk owned about 170 million shares of Tesla.
[00:41.88]On Saturday, Musk placed a poll on Twitter,
[00:45.88]asking if he should sell the stock.
[00:49.32]About 3.5 million people voted,
[00:52.32]and nearly 58 percent said he should.
[00:56.80]“I was prepared to accept either outcome,” Musk said.
[01:02.40]On Monday, the shares of Tesla stock dropped a small amount.
[01:08.28]David Madden is a stock market expert in London.
[01:12.20]He said he did not believe the “dip” would last long.
[01:17.72]“Tesla has had such a phenomenal record
[01:21.60]of bouncing back from these sort of selloffs,” he said.
[01:27.68]Musk said he understands people are concerned
[01:31.84]that very rich people avoid paying taxes.
[01:36.04]For example, many people
[01:38.76]who own millions of shares in a company like Musk does,
[01:43.08]do not sell their shares when they need money.
[01:47.00]Instead, they get loans from banks
[01:50.52]based on the value of the stock.
[01:53.92]If they do sell shares of stock, they get taxed,
[01:58.88]so they get the loans to buy something like a new home.
[02:02.92]Stock is not money. It is an ownership share in a company.
[02:09.36]Investors exchange stock for money by selling it on a market.
[02:15.88]People who follow Musk’s finances
[02:19.16]and company documents available to the public
[02:22.88]know that the businessman has a decision to make by next year.
[02:27.68]Until August 13, 2022, Musk will be able
[02:33.80]to buy more than 22 million shares of Tesla stock
[02:38.76]at a price of just over $6 each.
[02:43.04]Right now, Tesla stock sells for more than $1,000 per share.
[02:50.88]Musk says he is paid in
[02:53.68]what are known as stock options instead of money.
[02:57.88]An option is a financial agreement.
[03:01.16]It permits the owner of the option
[03:04.44]to trade stock at a set price for a set period of time.
[03:11.04]After that time period ends, the option is worth nothing.
[03:16.32]However, if he goes through with the option,
[03:20.04]he would have to pay a lot in taxes on the deal.
[03:25.72]Bryan Springmeyer is a lawyer in San Francisco.
[03:30.12]He said it is unlikely Musk would take a loan to pay his taxes,
[03:36.72]so he thinks Musk will buy the shares and then sell some of them.
[03:43.00]United States lawmakers have been thinking about ways
[03:46.64]to get very rich people to pay more taxes.
[03:50.04]They are discussing a plan to tax people
[03:53.52]who have large amounts of stock
[03:56.20]whether they have sold the shares or not.
[04:00.24]Musk criticized the idea, saying: "Eventually,
[04:05.00]they run out of other people’s money
[04:07.60]and then they come for you."
[04:11.52]Ron Wyden is a U.S. Senator from Oregon.
[04:15.60]He leads the Senate Finance Committee.
[04:18.48]Soon after Musk’s announcement, he said,
[04:21.96]“It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.”
