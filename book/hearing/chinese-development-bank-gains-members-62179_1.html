[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]Development banking in Asia has been in the news lately.
[00:04.47]Last year, China proposed creation of a development bank
[00:09.36]called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
[00:14.11]Chinese officials say the institution
[00:17.52]would help finance infrastructure projects throughout Asia.
[00:22.58]The area has a need for better roads and other infrastructure,
[00:29.08]including ports and power supplies.
[00:32.38]The Asian Development Bank, another organization,
[00:37.14]was set up to reduce poverty in Asia and the Pacific.
[00:42.81]It estimated last May that the Asia-Pacific area
[00:47.30]needs about $800 billion a year in infrastructure development.
[00:53.85]China reports that more than 20 countries
[00:58.30]have agreed to be founding members
[01:01.42]of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, or AIIB.
[01:08.35]Recently, some European powers added themselves to the list.
[01:14.76]U.S. allies Britain, Germany, France and Italy have joined up.
[01:21.94]So has South Korea.
[01:24.66]And Australia has agreed to move forward with negotiations.
[01:31.63]The United States, however,
[01:34.16]has said it is concerned about the governance of the AIIB.
[01:40.19]It has urged countries to consider the bank's standards,
[01:45.02]its social and environmental policies, before joining.
[01:50.92]Some observers say the United States
[01:54.98]should join the bank as a founding member.
[01:58.11]Asia expert Alejandro Reyes said
[02:02.85]the way the U.S. has dealt with the bank shows outdated thinking.
[02:08.70]Yet other observers have said it is unlikely the U.S. will do so.
[02:15.21]The last day to become a founding member is March 31st.
[02:20.97]Robert Kahn is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:28.04]He said U.S. officials are concerned
[02:31.47]that the AIIB may be seeking to replace existing institutions,
[02:37.80]such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
[02:43.44]"In a world with the better politics,
[02:45.83]the United States would be joining this institution,
[02:49.32]but because of the environment on the Hill (in Washington),
[02:52.97]the United States is not only not in position
[02:55.28]where it could join this institution and get it approved by Congress,
[02:58.65]it cannot get even basic reform in the IMF through in a way
[03:03.50]that would make the existing institutions more attractive to the rising powers."
[03:08.42]The U.S. Congress has failed to approve reforms of voting rights
[03:13.46]for the International Monetary Fund.
[03:16.53]The delay has led China and other countries
[03:20.69]to consider setting up their own institutions 
[03:24.76]as a way to gain more influence in world economic governance.
[03:30.54]Still, officials at the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank
[03:38.81]say they are looking for ways to cooperate with the AIIB.
[03:45.47]U.S. officials say they welcome new multi-lateral institutions
[03:52.34]that would observe high standards that the international community has built.
[03:58.45]China says it will uphold high standards.
[04:02.95]But most details will not become clear until the new bank is operational.
[04:10.23]The bank is expected to start with $100 billion in capital, mostly from China.
[04:19.42]Experts say it remains to be seen
[04:23.32]how China will take on a leadership position in the AIIB
[04:29.69]or whether it will work with existing organizations.
[04:33.99]Tom Wright is director of the Project of International Order and Strategy
[04:40.89]at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.
[04:45.60]"This is not the end. It really is just [the] beginning
[04:49.27]and especially the beginning of a new chapter for China.
[04:52.15]It set up this bank, it said it is going to take a leadership position,
[04:56.45]but huge questions still hang over how it is going to behave."
[05:01.94]China considers itself in a good position
[05:06.09]to carry out infrastructure projects in Asia.
[05:09.62]However, it has depended on state-owned companies and labor when working overseas.
[05:17.36]Using international labor standards rather than Chinese labor rules
[05:24.31]would be a step forward, says economist Liu Li-gang of the ANZ Banking Group.
[05:31.88]He says China should open up competition for bank-supported projects.
[05:39.04]He said this will reduce criticism from often linked to Chinese foreign investment.
[05:46.65]I'm Mario Ritter.
