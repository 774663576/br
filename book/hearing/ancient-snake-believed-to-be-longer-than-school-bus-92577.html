[00:00.04]An ancient giant snake in India
[00:03.12]may have been longer than a school bus
[00:06.28]and weighed up to a metric ton,
[00:08.96]researchers reported Thursday.
[00:11.88]Ancient remains of the snake
[00:13.92]were found near a coal mine
[00:16.08]in the western state of Gujarat.
[00:19.08]Researchers say it stretched
[00:21.24]an estimated 11 meters to 15 meters.
[00:24.92]It is comparable to the largest
[00:27.60]known snake at about 13 meters.
[00:30.20]That snake existed in what is now Colombia.
[00:35.40]The largest living snake
[00:37.16]is Asia's reticulated python at 10 meters.
[00:42.24]The newly discovered snake lived 47 million years ago
[00:46.64]in western India's damp evergreen forests.
[00:50.24]It could have weighed up to 1,000 kilograms,
[00:54.00]researchers said in the journal Scientific Reports.
[00:59.28]The researchers gave it the name Vasuki indicus.
[01:03.24]It is named after "the mythical snake king Vasuki,
[01:07.40]who wraps around the neck of the Hindu deity Shiva,"
[01:11.88]said study co-writer Debajit Datta
[01:15.12]of the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.
[01:20.00]The ancient snake was too big for quick attacks.
[01:24.04]"Considering its large size,
[01:26.60]Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush," Datta said.
[01:30.56]In hunting for food,
[01:32.52]the snake would wrap its body around a target in a crushing hold.
[01:38.96]Parts of the snake's backbone were discovered in 2005
[01:43.00]by study co-writer Sunil Bajpai,
[01:46.36]who is based at the same institute as Datta.
[01:49.84]The researchers compared more than 20 fossil backbones
[01:53.96]to skeletons of living snakes to estimate size.
[01:59.04]It is not clear exactly what Vasuki ate.
[02:02.48]But other fossils found nearby
[02:05.36]suggest the snake lived in swampy areas
[02:08.16]alongside catfish, turtles,
[02:10.92]crocodiles and early whales.
[02:13.68]These animals may have served as food for Vasuki.
[02:19.56]The other extinct giant snake, Titanoboa,
[02:23.36]was discovered in Colombia.
[02:25.80]It is estimated to have lived around 60 million years ago.
[02:31.28]Both snakes lived during exceptionally warm climate periods,
[02:35.44]said Cambridge University fossil scientist, Jason Head,
[02:39.76]who was not involved in the study.
[02:42.56]Snakes are cold-blooded animals, he noted.
[02:46.44]They would require higher temperatures to grow large.
[02:50.32]So does that mean
[02:51.72]that global warming could bring back huge snakes?
[02:55.24]In theory, it is possible, Head said.
[02:58.32]But it is not likely.
[03:00.48]The climate is now warming too quickly
[03:03.16]for snakes to evolve to such large sizes, the scientist said.
