[00:01.92]A 420-meter white steel tube
[00:05.64]running alongside a railway line
[00:08.52]in the northern Netherlands
[00:10.68]could be the start of a new kind of transportation
[00:14.12]for people and goods.
[00:17.08]The tube is the heart
[00:18.52]of the new European Hyperloop Center
[00:21.16]that opened recently in Veendam.
[00:24.84]Developers will be testing the changing technology
[00:28.20]there over the coming years.
[00:31.20]Hyperloop technology was once supported
[00:34.20]by business leader Elon Musk.
[00:37.40]It involves capsules that float on magnetic fields
[00:41.48]that move at speeds
[00:42.80]of around 700 kilometers per hour
[00:45.80]through low-pressure tubes.
[00:48.80]Its supporters say it is far more efficient
[00:52.32]than short flights, high-speed rail, and trucks.
[00:57.64]When Musk first presented the idea,
[01:00.20]he said it could transport people
[01:02.72]the nearly 645 kilometers
[01:05.68]between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 30 minutes.
[01:11.36]But since then, progress has been slow
[01:14.16]to get from an idea to the real world.
[01:18.00]Sascha Lamme is the center's director.
[01:21.28]He expects to have the first hyperloop route by 2030.
[01:27.16]He predicts it might be about five kilometers
[01:30.48]and will transport people.
[01:33.44]He said, "There's already preparations being done
[01:36.92]for such routes in for example Italy or India."
[01:42.32]Not everybody shares such hopeful thoughts
[01:44.76]about Hyperloop's future.
[01:47.44]Robert Noland is a professor
[01:49.40]at the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy
[01:52.88]at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
[01:56.48]He told The Associated Press that policy makers
[02:00.40]chase after big ideas of the future
[02:03.28]but they should invest in simpler transportation structures.
[02:08.20]He added, "It costs too much to build."
[02:11.76]Lamme said non-believers
[02:14.28]should come and take a look for themselves.
[02:17.80]He said, "We built the European Hyperloop Center
[02:21.44]and from what we have built,
[02:23.40]we know that we can be competitive with high-speed rail."
[02:28.16]And he noted that they have not added all of the ways
[02:32.44]they can reduce costs over the next ten years.
[02:37.40]The test center's tube is made up of 34 separate sections
[02:42.20]mostly 2 and a half meters wide.
[02:46.00]A piece of equipment next to the tube
[02:48.68]removes air in the tube
[02:50.68]to reduce the pressure inside the tube.
[02:54.44]That reduces air resistance
[02:56.96]and permits capsules to travel at such high speeds.
[03:01.68]A capsule built by Dutch hyperloop company

[03:15.32]and the European Commission.
[03:18.32]The Veendam tube has a switch
[03:20.64]where it splits into two separate tubes
[03:22.96]that capsules can go through.
[03:26.08]Marinus van der Meijs

[03:46.92]for their technology will be coming.
[03:50.16]Lamme said the main difficulty
[03:52.32]is finding government approval to build routes.
[03:56.24]And he said finding new financial support
[03:59.52]to test and show the technology
[04:02.12]is what is needed to make this happen.
