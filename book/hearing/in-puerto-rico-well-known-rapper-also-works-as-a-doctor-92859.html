<p>The U.S. territory is currently facing power outages as well as a shortage of medical professionals. Many doctors and other workers have gone to the U.S. mainland seeking better pay.</p>
<p>A 2023 report by Puerto Rican policy group Center for a New Economy found the territory had lost more than 8,600 doctors out of nearly 18,800 in just over 10 years. The problem is expected to get worse in the coming years.</p>
<p>“We have a huge <strong>exodus</strong> of young people,” Vázquez told the AP. He added, “In Puerto Rico, we have a crisis much bigger than people think.”</p>
<p>Vázquez said he travels from the capital, San Juan, to rural areas of the island at least once a week. During these trips, he seeks to treat communities struggling from the combined effects of hurricanes, earthquakes and a weak economy.</p>
<p>When not working as a doctor, Vázquez produces and performs music that brings attention to issues including social inequality, poverty and gun violence.</p>
<p>In one song, he brings up the territory's problems with violence. “A bullet is flying, lost like a child,” he raps, “the wind <strong>caresses</strong> it, seeks to make news, falling into a skull, without any kind of justice.” The rap song, in English, is called <em>Bullets Cry</em>.</p>
<p>In another song, called <em>We are More</em>, Vázquez comments on the territory's economic problems. He raps, “The debt has been placed before the worker, the one who goes outside under the rain and the sun, public servers, teachers and nurses."</p>
<p>Vázquez has left and returned to the island several times. This is common for many Puerto Ricans, who hold U.S. passports. He does not criticize those who have left Puerto Rico for the U.S. mainland. “You can't judge anybody, everybody has their story,” he said. “I'm <strong>blessed</strong> to have two <strong>careers</strong> that I can do and live off of.”</p>
<p>Vázquez was born in the Bronx area of New York City. But he moved with his family to the town of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Later, he went to Pennsylvania, before returning to Bayamón, Puerto Rico. It was there that Vázquez studied medicine. He became a doctor in 2015.</p>
<p>He became a household name as a rapper for a younger generation in Latin America in 2018. The single that made Vázquez a star was called <em>What Is Your Plan?</em> He worked with Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny and reggaeton singer Nejo on the song.</p>
<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, he decided to start working in medicine again. Vázquez worked full-time at a hospital in Ponce for a year. Then, as a general doctor, he treated patients of all ages.</p>
<p>Vázquez noted that some doctors questioned his medical abilities at first, since he had spent years performing as a rapper. But after a short time, he said, “Everybody knew that this wasn't a joke for me, and that I'm really good at what I do.”</p>

[00:00.04]A popular rapper in Puerto Rico
[00:03.56]has kept his job as a doctor
[00:06.76]to help deal with a shortage of medical workers
[00:11.32]in the United States territory.
[00:14.40]Many Puerto Ricans know Dr. Pedro Juan Vázquez
[00:20.12]by his performing name, PJ Sin Suela.
[00:25.16]But others are now getting to see his medical skills
[00:29.84]as he often goes door-to-door to serve patients.
[00:34.96]The 34-year-old Vázquez
[00:38.36]recently told The Associated Press (AP)
[00:42.56]he is still living out his love of music.
[00:46.24]He also believes he is helping those in need
[00:50.80]and bringing attention to a health crisis in Puerto Rico.
[00:57.08]The U.S. territory is currently facing power outages
[01:02.36]as well as a shortage of medical professionals.
[01:06.36]Many doctors and other workers
[01:09.68]have gone to the U.S. mainland seeking better pay.

[01:22.64]found the territory had lost more than
[01:26.64]8,600 doctors out of nearly 18,800
[01:33.84]in just over 10 years.
[01:36.88]The problem is expected to get worse in the coming years.
[01:42.32]"We have a huge exodus of young people,"
[01:46.52]Vázquez told the AP.
[01:49.76]He added, "In Puerto Rico,
[01:52.72]we have a crisis much bigger than people think."
[01:57.56]Vázquez said he travels from the capital, San Juan,
[02:02.88]to rural areas of the island at least once a week.
[02:07.76]During these trips, he seeks to treat communities
[02:12.80]struggling from the combined effects of hurricanes,

[02:21.12]When not working as a doctor,
[02:24.00]Vázquez produces and performs music

[02:57.24]The rap song, in English, is called Bullets Cry.
[03:02.24]In another song, called We are More,
[03:06.28]Vázquez comments on the territory's economic problems.
[03:11.80]He raps, "The debt has been placed before the worker,
