<p>American health officials say people age 50 and older should get vaccinated against bacteria that cause pneumonia and other dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is an infection that affects the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can cause a rise in body temperature. Pneumonia can also lead to a <strong>cough</strong> that produces yellow, green or bloody substances.</p>
<p>The advice, or recommendation, was offered by a group of scientific advisors and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The former age recommendation for adult vaccinations was 65 and older.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This electron microscopic image provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows two, round-shaped, Gram-positive, Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria.

<p>CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a statement, “Now is a great time to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease in preparation for the winter <strong>respiratory</strong> season.”</p>
<p>The advisors voted 14-1 to change the age recommendation during an October meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, home of the CDC headquarters. Doctors widely follow the agency's guidance.</p>
<p>Pneumococcal shot recommendations are sometimes called the most complex vaccination guidance that the government issues.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html">CDC currently recommends</a> shots for children younger than five and adults 50 or older, as long as they have never been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Officials also recommend the shots for children and adults at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, such as those with diabetes, liver disease or a weakened immune, or defense, system.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 known kinds of pneumococcal bacteria. They can cause serious infections in the lungs and other parts of the body. Each year, the U.S. sees about 30,000 cases of pneumococcal disease, which includes blood infections, brain and spine inflammation, and other problems. About 30 percent of cases are among people aged 50 to 64.</p>
<p>The first pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1977. Since then, drugmakers have been coming up with newer versions that target several bacteria in a single shot.</p>
<p>There are four vaccines now in use. They include Prevnar 20 from Wyeth-Pfizer, and Vaxneuvance and Pneumovax 23 made by Merck. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year also approved Merck's Capvaxive, which can cost around $300 a treatment. The new shot can protect against 21 kinds of bacteria, including eight not included in other pneumococcal vaccines. A Merck spokesperson said it is designed to help protect against the bacteria that cause the majority of severe disease in adults aged 50 and older.</p>
<p>In June, the CDC advisors recommended the vaccine as a possible shot for adults at higher risk. At the time, the group also talked about the possibility of lowering the age recommendation for older adults. They noted that infections causing sickness <strong>peak </strong>at age 55 to 59 among Black Americans — a lower age than found among white Americans.</p>
<p>Some scientists have concerns about the CDC recommendation. They say a second treatment, called a booster, may be necessary in about 15 years. And some new vaccines in development could force another update to the recommendations.</p>
<p>Dr. Jamie Loehr is the chair of the committee's pneumococcal working group. He was the only person to vote against the proposal.</p>
<p>He said, “Pneumococcal has been a very <strong>confusing </strong>recommendation for many, many years and it's hard to have a new recommendation every two or three years.”</p>
