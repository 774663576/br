The COVID-19 health crisis has made it harder for older Americans who are in assisted living homes to have physical contact with their families.</p>
<p>The Juniper Village at Louisville is an assisted living home in a neighborhood near Denver, Colorado. It has fully vaccinated people living there and its workers. With the help of TRU Community Care, a nonprofit healthcare organization, Juniper Village created "hug <strong>tents</strong>" with plastic for people living there.</p>

<p>Amanda Meier is a project coordinator with TRU Community Care. With the help of her husband and some volunteers, they built the "hug tent." It includes plastic arm <strong>sleeves</strong> for safe contact.</p>

<p>Lynda can no longer take care of Len by herself because of broken bones in her back. "I really needed it...It meant a lot to me, and it's been a long, long time," Lynda Hartman said after her short visit in the hug tent.</p>
