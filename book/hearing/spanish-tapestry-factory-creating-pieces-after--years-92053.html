<p>The factory recently received one of its biggest orders, 32 tapestries for the Palace of Dresden in Germany. The order is worth more than 1 million dollars and it will provide work for up to five years, Klecker de Elizalde said.</p>
<p>In 2018, the factory finished a tapestry for a Lebanese buyer based on the work <em>Sabra and Shatila Massacre</em> by Iraqi artist Dia al-Azzawi. The cloth shows the 1982-83 violence by Christian Phalangist militia in Palestinian refugee camps that were guarded by Israeli troops.</p>
<p>Creating a tapestry is a difficult process that takes several weeks or months of work for each square meter.</p>
<p>A tapestry begins with "cartoons," or drawings on paper that are later copied onto a system of material called <strong>warps</strong> which are then <strong>woven</strong> over.</p>
<p>One of the factory's well-known cartoonists was master painter Francisco Goya, who began working there in 1780. Some of the tapestries he designed are now found in the nearby Prado Museum and Madrid's Royal Collections Gallery.</p>
