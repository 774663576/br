<p>Just 25 years ago, the French bulldog was not even among the top 75 breeds. Its new popularity worries fans of the breed.</p>

<p>Stefaniak owns two French bulldogs herself. She has trained them to run and walk in hilly areas.</p>
<p>"These dogs can be very fit, can be very active," Stefaniak said. "They don't have to be <strong>sedentary</strong> dogs that can't breathe."</p>
<p>The AKC's popularity ratings cover about 200 breeds. The information is based on nearly 716,500 newly registered dogs last year. The group says about one in every seven on that registry is a French bulldog. Registration is voluntary.</p>
<p>The AKC's new top five dogs are French bulldogs, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, German shepherds and poodles. In positions six to ten are bulldogs, Rottweilers, beagles, dachshunds and German shorthaired pointers.</p>
<p>The Frenchie breed beat the Labrador retriever by over 21,000 dogs.</p>
<p>With roots in England and then France, the French bulldog is popular with several famous Americans, including actor Leonardo di Caprio, rapper Megan Thee Stallion and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the United States Congress.</p>
