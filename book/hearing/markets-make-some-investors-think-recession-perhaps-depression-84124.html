[00:00.04]The coronavirus outbreak has sent shock waves through stock markets in the United States and around the world.
[00:09.36]Now, with a sharp drop in share prices, investors are beginning to consider the possibility of something worse than a recession.
[00:21.12]With the possibility of weak economic conditions over a long period,
[00:26.68]people are now talking about a credit crisis or even a depression.
[00:33.68]The rising shock from the outbreak and questions over how it will spread
[00:39.56]has left both investors and economists trying to understand the financial effects.
[00:47.84]"This market looks like it has already priced in most of a...recession,"
[00:53.84]said Frances Donald, an economist at Manulife Investment Management.
[01:00.04]"It is now on top of that having to price in some probability of a credit crisis."
[01:07.00]Experts with leading banks and financial businesses now say they expect a sharp drop
[01:13.84]in economic activity over the next three months, maybe longer.
[01:20.16]They note that governments in the United States and Europe
[01:24.68]have told citizens to stay at home and ordered restaurants and schools to close.
[01:31.76]There is hope among some economists, however, that the economy will start expanding again later this year.
[01:40.92]But that depends, in part, on efforts to contain COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
[01:51.80]The S&amp;P 500 is one leading measure of American stock prices.
[01:58.28]The S&amp;P, on average, has fallen 28 percent from its high
[02:04.80]to lowest levels during recessions, notes Keith Lerner, a market historian.
[02:12.28]Lerner works for Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services.
[02:18.96]At the end of trading on Monday, the S&amp;P 500 index had dropped nearly 30 percent since its high on February 19.
[02:31.12]During the financial crisis in the late 2000s, it was much worse.
[02:37.24]At that time, the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 50 percent.
[02:43.60]"A 2008-like financial contagion is not yet priced into this market," Donald noted.
[02:52.20]She said the stock market will not calm down until investors see a calming of credit markets
[03:01.00]and the number of coronavirus cases starts to decrease.
[03:07.72]Stocks fell on Monday, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve
[03:12.96]took emergency action designed to strengthen the economy.
[03:17.72]The Fed used the same weapon -- interest rates -- that helped the country recover from the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009.
[03:30.76]But the market's reaction on Monday after the Fed's decision to cut interest rates
[03:37.72]is "a sign of a total breakdown of confidence," said economist Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities.
[03:47.44]He says that brings up the main question: how bad a recession will we have?
[03:55.80]Joachim Fels serves as global economic advisor at PIMCO.
[04:02.08]He said in a written commentary that a worldwide recession appeared to be inevitable.
[04:10.72]He added that the job for governments and central banks was to try to make the recession
[04:18.40]as short as possible and to avoid an economic depression.
[04:25.76]Fels defined a depression as a prolonged period of weak economic activity,
[04:32.56]a large rise in unemployment, businesses going bankrupt and bank collapses.
[04:41.36]One big Wall Street name is very concerned.
[04:45.44]Billionaire investor Ray Dalio is worried that the Federal Reserve
[04:51.28]used all its power too early when it cut interest rates to near zero.
[04:58.84]Dalio says he was concerned that another economic downturn could leave nowhere to go
