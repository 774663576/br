巴黎市长安妮·伊达尔戈长期以来一直致力于减少城市对汽车的依赖。她希望看到更多的人骑自行车四处走动。</p>

多年来，市政府对汽车进行了限制，并将自行车道的长度从200公里增加到1000公里以上。</p>

蒂伯·奎尔是法国自行车用户联合会的发言人。他说，他记得小时候乘车旅行时看到“到处都是交通堵塞”。</p>
<p>"Now, it's really like a bike traffic jam," he said. "It's kind of a good difficulty to have, especially when we think about what Paris used to be."<br/>
他说：“现在成了自行车交通堵塞，这是我们遇到的一个很大的困难，尤其是当我们想到巴黎曾经的样子时。”</p>

该市将于2024年举办夏季奥运会，并计划届时增加更多自行车道。巴黎希望在奥运会期间将污染减少一半，尽管来自世界各地的游客将到巴黎参加奥运会。组织者表示，所有比赛场地都将能通过60公里的自行车道网络骑自行车到达。</p>

他说，他80%的出行都使用巴黎的共享单车系统。他仍然有怨言。</p>

[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has long worked
[00:04.08]to make her city less dependent on cars.
[00:08.24]She wanted to see more people using bicycles,
[00:12.44]or bikes, to get around.
[00:15.84]Over a number of years, the city government
[00:19.84]put in restrictions on cars
[00:23.12]and increased the amount of bike lanes
[00:26.88]from 200 kilometers to over 1,000 kilometers.
[00:31.76]Now, her effort seems to have paid off.
[00:36.24]This year, Parisians are not complaining
[00:40.52]about too much automobile traffic.
[00:44.12]Instead, they say there are too many bikes.
[00:49.40]Thibault Quere is a spokesperson
[00:52.92]for France's Federation of Bicycle Users.
[00:56.68]He said he remembered seeing "traffic jams all over the place"
[01:02.16]when he traveled by car as a child.
[01:06.48]"Now, it's really like a bike traffic jam," he said.
[01:11.32]"It's kind of a good difficulty to have,
[01:14.56]especially when we think about what Paris used to be."
[01:20.52]Some famous roads along the River Seine
[01:24.64]are completely closed to cars.
[01:28.12]Now you see people riding bikes, running,
[01:32.36]and walking with their families along the river.
[01:36.52]In another part of Paris,
[01:39.16]a bike path on Sebastopol Boulevard
[01:43.44]is one of the busiest in Europe,
[01:46.16]after opening in 2019.
[01:49.84]In one week in early September,
[01:52.56]it recorded a record high of 124,000 riders.
[01:58.44]Paris en Selle is a volunteer organization
[02:03.36]supporting cycling in the city.
[02:06.20]It says the French capital's bike paths
[02:10.08]are busier than some popular ones in London
[02:13.76]and almost as busy as some in Amsterdam.
[02:17.72]Amsterdam is known for its high bike usage.
[02:22.84]Experts say the revolution will continue.
[02:26.52]Instead of the honking of horns and

[02:32.24]Paris will become known for cyclists, they say.

[02:58.00]Organizers say all of the competition sites
[03:01.40]will be reachable by bike
[03:03.08]through a 60-kilometer network of bike lanes.
[03:07.60]The change to Paris, however, has not been easy.
[03:12.64]With more people using bikes,
[03:15.40]more people are making mistakes.
[03:18.40]Some of them are new to cycling
