川普总统及其政府通讯团队与媒体的关系异常。他的通讯团队举办的新闻发布会相对较少。办过的新闻发布会也通常是敌对的。川普有时候直接与福克斯新闻电视节目的播音员对话，而不是跟白宫记者对话。</p>
<p>In a statement announcing the White House communications team, Biden said: "Communicating directly and truthfully to the American people is one of the most important duties of a President, and this team will be entrusted with the tremendous responsibility of connecting the American people to the White House."<br/>

拜登还提名女性担任其内阁多个高级职位。周一，候任总统和他的过渡团队宣布提名耶伦为美国财政部长。如果获得参议院批准，耶伦将成为有史以来第一位领导美国财政部的女性。</p>

<p>Biden has also nominated Avril Haines as Director of National Intelligence; Neera Tanden as Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Cecelia Rouse as chair of Council of Economic Advisors.<br/>
拜登还提名艾薇儿·海恩斯为美国国家情报总监。提名妮拉·坦登为美国行政管理和预算局局长。提名塞西莉亚·罗斯为美国经济顾问委员会主席。</p>

拜登作为总统候选人时曾经承诺其政府人选将会代表美国公众的多样性。</p>

拜登在夏季时还表示，他将会提名一名女性担任副总统。他在8月11日选择了参议员卡玛拉·哈里斯，这是一名黑人女性和印度裔女性。哈里斯现在即将成为美国首位女副总统。</p>
