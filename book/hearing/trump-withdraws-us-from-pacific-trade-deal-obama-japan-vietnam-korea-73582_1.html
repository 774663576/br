<div class="content">President Donald Trump officially withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal on Monday.川普总统周一正式让美国退出跨太平洋伙伴关系贸易协定（简称TPP）。 The move was expected. Even before he announced his candidacy for president 18 months ago, Trump said the trade deal was bad for American workers.<br/>此举是意料之中的事情。甚至在18个月前宣布竞选总统之前，川普就说这一贸易协定对美国工人不利。
<p>The president signed an anti-TPP executive order at the White House, as reporters watched.<br/>在记者的见证下，川普在白宫签署了退出TPP协定的行政命令。</p>
<p>"We've been talking about this for a long time," Trump said. "A great thing for the American worker, what we just did."<br/>川普说，“我们很长一段时间一直都在讨论这件事情。我们刚刚做了一件对美国工人非常有利的事情。”</p>
<p>During his campaign for the presidency, Trump said some trade deals with other countries cost America jobs. He said they lead employers to move operations outside the United States to save on labor costs.<br/>川普在总统竞选期间表示，美国同其它国家的一些贸易协定夺走了美国的就业。他说，这些协定导致雇主们把业务搬到美国境外以节省劳动力成本。</p>
<p>Obama administration negotiated TPP<br/>奥巴马政府谈妥TPP协定</p>
<p>The United States negotiated the TPP during the administration of former President Barack Obama. But the U.S. Congress never approved the trade deal.<br/>在前总统奥巴马主政期间，美国谈妥了TPP协定。但是美国国会从未批准这项贸易协定。</p>
<p>The agreement would have lowered tariffs on trade involving the U.S. and 11 other countries, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile and Japan. The others are Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.<br/>这项协定原本将会降低涉及美国和另外11个国家的贸易关税。这些国家包括澳大利亚、文莱、加拿大、智利和日本，另外还包括马来西亚、墨西哥、新西兰、秘鲁、新加坡和越南。</p>
<p>The TPP would have been the biggest trade deal in history, covering nearly 40 percent of the world economy. China did not take part in the negotiations. But it appears ready to sign its own trade deals with Southeast Asian countries that would have been part of the TPP.<br/>TPP协定本来将会成为有史以来最大的贸易协定，覆盖了全球经济近40%。中国未参与这次谈判。但是该国似乎做好了同一些东南亚国家签署自己的贸易协定的准备，这些国家原本将成为TPP协定一部分。</p>
<p>Former President Obama said the trade agreement would be good for the United States. Without a deal, he said, China would write the rules for the global economy.<br/>前总统奥巴马表示，这一贸易协定对美国有利。他说，如果没有这一协定，中国就将制定全球经济规则。</p>
<p>Last Friday, Trump was sworn-in as president. He was elected last November after defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Both she and Obama are members of the Democratic Party. Trump was the Republican presidential candidate.<br/>上周五，川普宣誓就任总统。他去年11月击败前国务卿希拉里当选为总统。希拉里和奥巴马都是民主党成员，川普是共和党总统候选人。</p>
<p>After being sworn-in, Trump said his administration would work to put "America First," signaling a move to more isolationist policies.<br/>川普在宣誓就职后表示，他的政府将会致力于把美国放在第一位，这表明他将会转向更孤立的政策。</p>
<p>TPP would have cut more than 18,000 tariffs, including taxes on all goods made in the U.S. and almost all American farm products. The deal sought to end child labor abuses and set better conditions for workers on pay, hours of work and safety and health.<br/>TPP协定原本将会削减超过1.8万种关税，包括所有美国制造商品和几乎所有美国农产品。该协定力求停止滥用童工，并在待遇、工作时长、安全和健康方面为工人创造更好的条件。</p>
<p>At the start of talks with business leaders on Monday, Trump said he would reduce government rules on businesses by 75 percent or more. And he said the U.S. government would be streamlined. By streamlined, he meant there would be fewer government workers.<br/>川普周一在同商界领袖会谈伊始表示，他将会减少政府对企业75%甚至更多的监管法规。他还表示将会精简美国政府，他希望通过精简减少政府雇员。</p>
<p>"The regulations are going to be cut massively and the taxes way down," he said.<br/>他说，“监管法规将被大幅削减，税负会大为下降。””</p>
<p>But he also warned the business leaders not to move operations to other countries. He said businesses would pay a heavy price if they make products in other countries, and then try to sell them in the United States.<br/>但他也警告商界领袖不要将业务转到其它国家。他说，如果企业在其它国家生产产品然后试图在美国销售，他们就将会付出沉重代价。</p>
<p>The new president said he also wants to change the terms of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada.<br/>这位新总统称他还希望修改同墨西哥以及加拿大签署的1994年北美自由贸易协定。</p>
<p>On Sunday, Trump announced he will discuss NAFTA, immigration and border security when he meets with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the end of January. The Trump administration said he also plans to meet soon with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.<br/>川普周日宣布，他将在今年一月底同墨西哥总统恩里克·佩纳·尼托（Enrique Pena Nieto）会面时，讨论北美自由贸易协定、移民和边境安全问题。川普政府表示，他还计划尽快同加拿大<br/>总理</p>
<p>贾斯丁·特鲁多(Justin Trudeau)会面。</p>
<p>"I think we're going to have a very good result for Mexico, for the United States, and for everyone involved," Trump said.<br/>川普说，“我认为我们会谈出一个对墨西哥、美国和所有涉及人员来说都很好的结果。”</p>
<p>Japan approved TPP Friday<br/>日本周五批准了TPP协定</p>
<p>Last week, Japan's Parliament approved the TPP. But Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that without the United States, the trade deal would become "meaningless."<br/>上周，日本议会批准了TPP协定。但是日本首相安倍晋三表示，离开美国，这一贸易协定将变得毫无意义。</p>
<p>Japanese stock prices fell on Monday. Market watchers said it showed investors' reaction to Trump's "America First" speech and the U.S. rejection of the TPP.<br/>日本股市周一有所下跌。市场观察家表示，这表明了投资者对川普的“美国优先”演讲和美国退出TPP协定的反应。</p>
<p>South Korea is not part of the TPP, but has a free trade agreement with the United States.<br/>韩国并未参与TPP协定，但是该国同美国签订了一项自由贸易协定。</p>
<p>Some American companies noted that South Korea tries to get around the agreement by putting strong non-tariff rules on U.S. imports.<br/>一些美国公司指出，韩国试图通过对美国进口强加非关税规定来规避这份协定。</p>
<p>On Monday, South Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said the South Korean government has been in contact with the Trump administration. He said the government told Trump officials that it has lived up to the trade agreement.<br/>韩国代总统兼总理黄正恩周一表示，韩国政府一直在同川普政府接触。他说，韩国政府对川普政府官员表示，该国已经兑现了这一贸易协定。</p>
<p>Also on Monday, Trump signed executive orders suspending the employment of new federal workers, except for the military. His spokesman said the only exception would be workers in national or public security positions.<br/>同样是在周一，川普签署行政命令冻结雇佣新的联邦工作人员，除了军队以外。川普的发言人表示，唯一例外是国家或公共安全部门的雇员。</p>
<p>Another order banned U.S. non-governmental organizations that receive federal money from providing abortions outside the United States.

[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.12]President Donald Trump officially withdrew the United States
[00:04.68]from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal on Monday.
[00:09.64]The move was expected.
[00:12.75]Even before he announced his candidacy for president 18 months ago,
[00:18.40]Trump said the trade deal was bad for American workers.
[00:24.44]The president signed an anti-TPP executive order
[00:29.52]at the White House, as reporters watched.
[00:34.00]"We've been talking about this for a long time,"
[00:37.28]Trump said. "A great thing for the American worker, what we just did."
[00:43.12]During his campaign for the presidency,
[00:47.04]Trump said some trade deals with other countries cost America jobs.
[00:53.28]He said they lead employers to move operations
[00:57.24]outside the United States to save on labor costs.
[01:02.03]The United States negotiated the TPP
[01:06.00]during the administration of former President Barack Obama.
[01:10.98]But the U.S. Congress never approved the trade deal.
[01:16.68]The agreement would have lowered tariffs on trade
[01:20.32]involving the U.S. and 11 other countries,
[01:24.44]including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile and Japan.
[01:31.00]The others are Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.
[01:40.32]The TPP would have been the biggest trade deal in history,
[01:45.04]covering nearly 40 percent of the world economy.
[01:49.80]China did not take part in the negotiations.
[01:53.88]But it appears ready to sign its own trade deals with
[01:58.08]Southeast Asian countries that would have been part of the TPP.
[02:03.84]Former President Obama said the trade agreement would be good for the United States.
[02:10.32]Without a deal, he said, China would write the rules for the global economy.
[02:17.00]Last Friday, Trump was sworn-in as president.
[02:22.52]He was elected last November after defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
[02:29.12]Both she and Obama are members of the Democratic Party.
[02:34.80]Trump was the Republican presidential candidate.
[02:39.60]After being sworn-in, Trump said his administration would work to put "America First,"
[02:46.48]signaling a move to more isolationist policies.
[02:52.20]TPP would have cut more than 18,000 tariffs,
[02:56.80]including taxes on all goods made in the U.S.
[03:01.44]and almost all American farm products.
[03:05.56]The deal sought to end child labor abuses
[03:09.52]and set better conditions for workers on pay,
[03:13.72]hours of work and safety and health.
[03:17.40]At the start of talks with business leaders on Monday,
[03:21.88]Trump said he would reduce government rules on businesses by 75 percent or more.
[03:29.92]And he said the U.S. government would be streamlined.
[03:34.40]By streamlined, he meant there would be fewer government workers.
[03:40.24]"The regulations are going to be cut massively and the taxes way down," he said.
[03:47.40]But he also warned the business leaders not to move operations to other countries.
[03:55.08]He said businesses would pay a heavy price
[03:58.96]if they make products in other countries,
[04:01.84]and then try to sell them in the United States.
[04:06.24]The new president said he also wants to change the terms
[04:10.88]of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada.
[04:17.68]On Sunday, Trump announced he will discuss NAFTA,  immigration and border security
[04:25.96]when he meets with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the end of January.
[04:32.68]The Trump administration said he also plans to meet soon
[04:37.32]with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
[04:42.12]"I think we're going to have a very good result for Mexico,
[04:46.28]for the United States, and for everyone involved," Trump said.
[04:51.52]Last week, Japan's Parliament approved the TPP.
[04:58.24]But Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that without the United States,
[05:04.00]the trade deal would become "meaningless."
[05:08.20]Japanese stock prices fell on Monday.
[05:12.52]Market watchers said it showed investors' reaction
[05:16.88]to Trump's "America First" speech and the U.S. rejection of the TPP.
[05:24.32]South Korea is not part of the TPP,
[05:27.96]but has a free trade agreement with the United States.
[05:32.32]Some American companies noted that South Korea tries to get around the agreement
[05:39.44]by putting strong non-tariff rules on U.S. imports.
[05:44.72]On Monday, South Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn
[05:51.40]said the South Korean government has been in contact with the Trump administration.
[05:58.24]He said the government told Trump officials
[06:01.68]that it has lived up to the trade agreement.
[06:05.88]Also on Monday, Trump signed executive orders
[06:10.24]suspending the employment of new federal workers, except for the military.
[06:16.24]His spokesman said the only exception
[06:20.16]would be workers in national or public security positions.
[06:25.88]Another order banned U.S. non-governmental organizations
[06:30.40]that receive federal money from providing abortions outside the United States.
[06:37.80]The organizations had received government funding during the Obama presidency.
