。
[00:00.04]A University of Michigan student
[00:03.72]is one of the world's top "speedcubers,"
[00:07.16]a person able to quickly solve a Rubik's Cube.
[00:11.44]He also is a talented violinist.
[00:14.80]Stanley Chapel says the two activities work well together.
[00:20.04]He adds that he has equal interest in both.
[00:23.76]But the 21-year-old says the violin
[00:27.28]has helped him succeed in speedcubing.
[00:31.16]Chapel is studying violin performance
[00:33.84]at the university's school of music, theater and dance.
[00:39.12]He said that ideas he learned from music study
[00:42.64]such as repetition and "breaking things down
[00:46.36]into their smallest" elements helped him get better at cubing.
[00:51.88]Chapel grew up in Ann Arbor, not far
[00:55.36]from where the University of Michigan is located.
[00:58.72]He solved his first 3x3 Rubik's Cube as a 14-year-old.
[01:04.88]Five weeks later, Chapel entered his first competition,
[01:09.48]solving the cube in an average of 22 seconds.
[01:13.80]In 2017 in Paris, Chapel placed fifth in both the 4x4 blindfolded
[01:21.28]and 5x5 blindfolded groups
[01:24.40]at the World Cube Association World Championship.
[01:29.16]At the 2019 world championship in Melbourne, Australia,
[01:33.64]he won both events.
[01:36.00]Accounting for the time it takes for him to study the cube
[01:40.08]before placing the blindfold over his eyes,
[01:43.24]Chapel can solve one in around 17 seconds.
[01:48.20]"The deeper I go into ... cubing technique,
[01:51.12]the more I find interest in pushing the boundaries
[01:54.48]of what's possible there," he said.
[01:58.04]Chapel has some strong natural abilities.
[02:01.36]He is able to remember thousands of ways
[02:04.68]to solve a Rubik's Cube and perform one
[02:07.88]of Johann Sebastian Bach's violin pieces from memory.
[02:12.84]But Chapel also spends many hours working on his skills.
[02:17.24]In addition, he does regular hand exercises
[02:21.32]that help him avoid the kinds of pains
[02:24.52]that come with the large amounts of time
[02:27.48]turning the cube's sides.
[02:29.52]Chapel says years of playing the violin
[02:32.84]also has helped him have "very, very
[02:35.52]fine motor control already built up."
[02:38.28]Later this year, Chapel plans
[02:41.60]to defend his world titles in South Korea.
[02:45.44]Once he is done with school, though, Chapel is not sure
[02:49.12]how speedcubing fits into his future plans.
[02:53.20]"I guess it's cool to know that nobody is able to do this," he said.
[02:58.28]"But, at the same time, giving myself a little bit of a reality check,
[03:03.80]it's like, ‘How much does that actually matter?'"
[03:07.36]"It's not going to pay the bills when I'm older," Chapel said, laughing.
