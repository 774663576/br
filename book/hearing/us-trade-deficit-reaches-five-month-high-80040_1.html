7月份，美国商品和服务出口下降1%至2111美元。然而，商品和服务进口增长了0.9%，达到创纪录的2612美元，这些都受益于计算机和计算机零件的进口。总进口量较高的部分原因是由于石油价格上涨，石油进口量创下2014年12月以来新高。</p>

。
[00:00.84]The United States' trade deficit with other countries
[00:05.56]rose to a five-month high in July.
[00:10.60]At the same time, the U.S. trade deficit with China hit a record high.
[00:18.48]Economists say the latest numbers could influence the Trump administration
[00:25.16]to carry out its "America First" trade policies more aggressively.
[00:32.76]The administration's protectionist policies have left the United States
[00:39.52]in disputes with the European Union, Canada, Mexico and China.
[00:47.88]President Donald Trump says the United States is being used by its trading partners.
[00:56.68]The U.S. Commerce Department reported the rise in the trade deficit Wednesday.
[01:03.47]Its report came a day before the end of a public comment period
[01:10.28]about a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
[01:17.08]The U.S. government is expected to announce tariffs on those products.
[01:24.12]"America still isn't getting a fair deal on trade
[01:28.80]and that can only mean one thing," said Chris Rupkey,
[01:33.96]chief economist at the MUFG financial group in New York.
[01:40.39]"President Trump is going unleash another $200 billion in tariffs
[01:47.88]on China imports," he said.
[01:51.77]The Commerce Department report said the trade deficit
[01:56.64]increased 9.5 percent to $50.1 billion in July.
[02:04.80]This happened as exports of soybeans and civilian aircraft dropped,
[02:11.07]while imports hit a record high.
[02:15.02]The trade deficit has now widened in each of the past two months.
[02:22.24]The government announced import duties on goods including steel,
[02:27.44]aluminum, washing machines and solar panels earlier this year.
[02:34.52]It said the move was to protect American industries
[02:38.92]from what Trump says is unfair foreign competition.
[02:44.96]The United States and China each have put retaliatory tariffs
[02:50.72]on a combined $100 billion worth of products since early July.
[02:58.96]The Trump administration also wants to rework
[03:02.92]the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[03:06.76]The United States struck a deal with Mexico last week,
[03:11.91]but negotiations with Canada have been difficult.
[03:17.88]The administration says ending the trade deficit
[03:21.92]will put the economy on a path of faster growth.
[03:26.92]But economists say some of the government's policies,
[03:31.54]such as a $1.5 trillion tax cut earlier this year,
[03:37.80]will worsen the trade deficit.
[03:42.04]The trade deficit narrowed in April and May
[03:46.30]as farmers increased soybean exports to China
[03:51.01]before its tariffs on American products came into effect in early July.
[03:59.04]After considering inflation, the trade deficit increased
[04:04.32]to a five-month high of $82.5 billion in July from $79.3 billion in June.

[04:27.86]The trade gap with Mexico dropped 25.3 percent to $5.5 billion
[04:37.52]while the gap with Canada rose 57.6 percent to $3.1 billion.
[04:46.92]The trade deficit with the European Union
[04:51.00]rose 50 percent to a record high of $17.6 billion.
[04:59.64]In July, U.S. exports of goods and services fell one percent to $211.1 billion.
[05:11.52]However, imports of goods and services increased 0.9 percent to a record $261.2 billion.

[05:29.48]Total imports were higher, in part, thanks to petroleum imports,
[05:35.40]which were the highest since December 2014 because of higher oil prices.
