<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Americans Begin to Feel Better about Economy as Inflation Slows]

。
[00:00.04]Life is still more costly in the United States
[00:04.04]than it was about two years ago.
[00:07.12]But new research shows Americans
[00:10.20]are starting to feel better about the economy.
[00:14.16]An opinion study
[00:15.44]by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
[00:18.48]found that Americans are increasingly hopeful
[00:22.56]that the inflation rate will continue to go down.
[00:26.64]The survey also found that the number of Americans
[00:31.32]who expect their financial situation to improve
[00:35.56]within the next year is at its highest since June 2021.
[00:43.04]In addition, the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers
[00:47.92]recently reported the largest two-month jump
[00:51.24]in consumer sentiment since 1991.
[00:55.32]Consumer sentiment is a measure
[00:58.16]of how optimistic consumers feel about the economy.
[01:03.76]That optimism is balanced, however,
[01:07.00]by the fact that most Americans remember
[01:10.36]paying much less for daily purchases
[01:14.20]such as fuel and food only two or three years ago.
[01:19.52]Many food items such as bread, milk and chicken
[01:25.52]are more costly than they were in February 2021.
[01:31.44]But economists say price increases
[01:34.68]have slowed significantly in the last year.
[01:38.72]At the same time, Americans are seeing
[01:42.44]pay increases higher than the rate of inflation.
[01:47.08]The inflation rate was about 9 percent in June 2022.
[01:53.64]Today, the rate is 3.4 percent.
[01:57.64]The U.S. Federal Reserve
[02:00.24]would like to see the rate at only 2 percent.
[02:04.60]Grace Zwemmer is an analyst at Oxford Economics.
[02:09.68]She said it took some time for Americans
[02:13.20]to feel the effects of falling inflation.
[02:16.76]But, she said, "it appears the good news
[02:20.32]is finally getting through."
[02:23.08]Political observers wonder
[02:25.20]if the change in feelings about the economy will
[02:28.60]help U.S. President Joe Biden's re-election campaign.
[02:33.56]Will people feel the drop in inflation
[02:37.76]or will they still remember that prices
[02:41.16]are much higher than they were two or three years ago?
[02:46.80]Ryan Cummings is an economist
[02:49.04]who studies how politics affect consumer confidence.
[02:52.96]He said many Americans today
[02:56.24]base their feelings about the economy
[02:59.32]on what they hear from the politicians they support.
[03:03.28]Cummings said Republicans are likely to speak
[03:06.88]negatively about the economic performance
[03:10.28]during Biden's presidency,
[03:12.56]even as Democrats speak of the economic gains.
[03:17.68]The University of Michigan research
[03:19.84]shows consumer sentiment among Democrats
[03:23.52]jumped almost 12 percent in January.
[03:26.64]That is the second-highest increase ever.
[03:29.68]Many Americans say they want to see the government
[03:33.44]take steps to bring the prices of food, oil and meat
[03:38.16]back to where they were in 2020 or 2021.
[03:43.28]But economic experts say that is not a good idea.
[03:48.08]The moves that would be required
[03:50.84]to make that happen would hurt the economy overall.
[03:54.76]Taxes could increase and jobs would be lost.
[03:59.68]David Andolfatto
[04:01.44]is an economist at the University of Miami.
[04:04.60]He used to work for the Federal Reserve.
[04:07.48]He said the better idea for Americans
[04:11.12]is to "just move ahead."
[04:14.04]He explained that while the cost of living
[04:16.88]is higher than it was two or three years ago,
[04:20.04]many Americans are
[04:21.48]making more money than they were then.
[04:24.32]"There's no need for (the government)
[04:26.20]to bring the price level back down.
[04:28.56]It would be too painful," Andolfatto said.
[04:32.96]Claudia Sahm is another
[04:35.32]former Federal Reserve economist.
[04:38.04]She added that "people are angry"
[04:40.92]because they cannot afford the cost increases.
[04:45.08]"Can you afford it?" she asked.
[04:47.44]"Not everybody can say yes to that question.
[04:50.68]But over time, more and more people
[04:54.48]will be able to say yes."
