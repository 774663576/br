。
[00:00.04]A new, small robotic camera
[00:02.84]designed to be swallowed for use in medical examinations
[00:06.76]was recently demonstrated at a conference in Canada.
[00:11.52]The device called PillBot
[00:13.64]can be guided through a body remotely,
[00:16.40]meaning electronically from outside.
[00:19.52]Its creators hope the device will replace traditional endoscopies.
[00:24.76]An endoscopy is when a camera attached to a wire
[00:28.92]is directed down the throat
[00:31.32]and into a sleeping patient's stomach.
[00:35.24]The company Endiatx based in Hayward, California,
[00:39.56]developed the device.
[00:41.32]The research hospital, Mayo Clinic,
[00:44.04]in Rochester, Minnesota, is a partner in the project.
[00:49.80]The PillBot is designed to be the first
[00:52.60]motorized endoscopic camera.
[00:55.20]Here is how developers say it works:
[00:58.88]A patient does not eat for one day,
[01:02.04]then swallows the PillBot with lots of water.
[01:06.16]The PillBot acts like a small submarine
[01:09.12]controlled by a wireless remote control.
[01:12.20]When the exam is complete,
[01:14.64]the body will expel the PillBot
[01:17.20]in the same way it expels other solid waste.
[01:22.12]Dr. Vivek Kumbhari is co-founder of the company.
[01:27.08]He is professor of medicine
[01:29.76]and chairman of gastroenterology
[01:32.52]and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic.
[01:35.36]It is the latest step toward his larger goal
[01:38.96]of making complex medicine more accessible.
[01:43.84]If endoscopies can be moved
[01:45.96]from a hospital setting to a patient's home, he said,
[01:49.36]"then I think we have achieved that goal."
[01:52.96]Use of the device would require fewer medical workers
[01:56.96]and no anesthesia, he said.
[01:59.64]The device provides "a safer,
[02:02.20]more comfortable approach," he added.
[02:05.60]Kumbhari also said the technology is more efficient
[02:09.56]and permits people to get treatment earlier
[02:12.72]in the progress of a disease.
[02:15.92]Alex Luebke is the co-founder of Endiatx.
[02:19.68]He said the PillBot can help people in rural areas
[02:23.92]where medical centers and treatment are lacking.
[02:28.36]"Especially in developing countries,
[02:30.60]there is no access" to complex medical care, he said.
[02:34.16]"So being able to have the technology,
[02:37.04]gather all that information
[02:39.44]and provide you the solution,
[02:41.44]even in remote areas - that's the way to do it."
[02:46.20]The micro-robotic pill is undergoing testing.
[02:49.64]It could come before the U.S. Food
[02:52.84]and Drug Administration for consideration
[02:55.80]in the coming months.
[02:57.64]If approved, the PillBot could be available by 2026.
[03:03.72]Kumbhari hopes the technology can be
[03:06.40]expanded to the bowels, vascular system,
[03:09.76]heart, liver, brain and other parts of the body.
