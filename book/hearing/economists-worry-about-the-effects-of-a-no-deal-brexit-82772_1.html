<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Economists Worry About the Effects of a ‘No-deal’ Brexit]

。
[00:00.04]Concerns are growing that Britain's withdrawal from the European Union
[00:06.60]will cause economic problems for both sides.
[00:11.96]Making matters worse is the possibility that some European countries
[00:18.76]may see their economies decrease in the coming months.
[00:24.80]This week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to suspend Parliament for weeks.
[00:33.84]The goal of the action is to prevent lawmakers from passing legislation
[00:40.71]to block the country from leaving the EU without negotiating an agreement.
[00:49.16]The time limit for "Brexit," as it is called, is October 31.
[00:56.64]Negotiators have failed to reach an agreement in the three years
[01:02.31]since a majority of the British people voted to leave the EU in 2016.
[01:11.20]Many experts now believe a so called "no-deal Brexit" is likely to happen.
[01:20.76]Economists and business experts say the result of a no-deal Brexit
[01:27.54]would cause widespread problems and disorder.
[01:32.92]Problems could include new taxes on trade,
[01:37.43]slower movement of people and goods at borders,
[01:42.56]and problems with licenses to do business in other countries.
[01:50.60]Britain's withdrawal comes at an uncertain time for the EU.
[01:57.40]The trade dispute between the United States and China has already raised concerns for Europe.
[02:06.28]And Germany, which depends on exports and manufacturing,
[02:11.75]is facing the possibility of a recession.
[02:16.80]Germany could "be hit quite badly if a no-deal Brexit occurs in two months' time."
[02:26.32]That is what Andrew Kenningham said.
[02:29.68]He is an economist with Capital Economics, a research group in London.
[02:38.52]Germany is Europe's largest economy.
[02:42.21]From April to June, its economy shrank.
[02:47.52]Many economists believe the same will happen from July to September.
[02:54.40]That means the country would be in a recession as a no-deal Brexit takes place.
[03:03.60]Some economists also predict that Britain could fall into a recession as well.
[03:11.80]They estimate the British economy would shrink by about three percent.
[03:19.84]Italy's economy did not grow at all from April to June and could also face a recession.
[03:30.16]Supporters of Brexit, however, say companies have had more than three years to prepare.
[03:37.92]Finally leaving, they say, would remove uncertainty.
[03:45.52]Nigel Driffield is a professor of international business at Warwick Business School in Britain.
[03:54.64]He said it could take months or even years for terms of trade
[04:00.89]to be fully agreed on between Britain and the EU.
[04:07.36]He said some companies could prepare by planning for the future.
[04:14.16]"However, suppose another (supplier),
[04:17.57]perhaps in another country, fails to prepare,
[04:21.65]your part of the value chain still grinds to a halt,
[04:26.98]and your customer still stops ordering.
[04:30.92]What do you do?" Driffield asked.
[04:35.07]Driffield expects a no-deal Brexit to lead to five to 10 years of negotiations over trade.
[04:47.00]That is about as long as negotiations with Canada took to complete.
[04:54.32]The EU is Britain's largest trading partner, representing half of its international trade.
[05:03.80]Trade with Britain is 20 percent of the EU's trade total.
[05:10.80]By comparison, 18 percent of Britain's exports go to the U.S.
[05:18.80]Experts say the European countries that would suffer the most from a no-deal Brexit
[05:26.02]would be smaller ones that ship goods heavily to Britain,
[05:31.48]like the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland.
[05:37.44]Larger economies, like those of Germany and France, would suffer less.
[05:45.96]The effects outside of Europe are not expected to be very large.
[05:52.52]However, financial markets could be influenced, weakening the world economy.
[06:01.64]Possibly as a result of the lack of clarity,
[06:05.69]the European Central Bank is expected to announce new measures
[06:11.60]to ease the availability of money as soon as September 12.
[06:19.64]Some experts warn that such measures will help over the short term,
[06:26.32]but they say politicians must act to reach trade agreements and end disputes.
