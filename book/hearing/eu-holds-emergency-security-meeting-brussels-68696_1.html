<p>European Union justice and security ministers are meeting in Brussels Thursday to discuss ways to increase intelligence and security.欧盟各国司法和安全部长们周四将在布鲁塞尔会面，讨论如何加强情报和安全工作。</p>

<p>Officials earlier identified Khalid el-Bakraoui as the attacker in the bombing at the Maelbeek underground train station. Twenty people were killed in that explosion. Security video shows another man walking with Bakraoui. Belgian media report that police believe this second man could also have been involved.<br/>有关官员此前确认哈立德·巴克拉乌伊（Khalid el-Bakraoui）是马尔比克地铁站爆炸案中的袭击者。有20人在这起爆炸中丧生。监控录像显示还有一名男子与巴克拉乌伊同行。比利时媒体报道称，警方认为这第二名男子也可能涉案。</p>
<p>El-Bakraoui's brother Ibrahim has been officially identified as one of the two suicide bombers in the attack on the airport the same day.<br/>巴克拉乌伊的兄弟易卜拉欣已经被正式确认为同一天发生的机场袭击中的两名自杀式炸弹袭击者之一。</p>
<p>Media have reported the name of the second airport bomber as Najim Laachraoui. He is a bombmaker for Islamic State and considered a main partner in the Paris terror attacks last November.<br/>媒体已经公布第二名机场炸弹袭击者的名字为纳吉姆·拉赫劳利（Najim Laachraoui）。他为伊斯兰国制造炸弹，并被认为是去年11月法国巴黎恐怖袭击事件的重要帮凶。</p>
<p>A third man walking with the suicide bombers also appears in airport video. The recording shows him pushing a cart.<br/>机场视频中还出现与自杀式炸弹袭击者同行的第三名男子。视频显示他推着一辆行李车。</p>

"We need to have a union of security," he said.<br/>欧盟委员会主席容克周三在布鲁塞尔对记者们发表了讲话。他介绍了加强边境控制的提案以及加强欧盟范围内枪支管理的措施。他说，“我们需要一个安全联盟。”</p>
<p><strong>Visa-free system<br/>免签证制度</strong></p>
<p>Europe's visa-free system is also under increasing scrutiny. The system already is under heavy pressure from Europe's refugee crisis.<br/>欧洲的免签证系统也受到了越来越严格的审查。该系统已经受到了欧洲难民危机的沉重压力。</p>

<p>Also, Turkish officials said Wednesday they had caught Ibrahim el Bakraoui in 2013 at the Syrian border. They said they sent him to the Netherlands.<br/>此外，土耳其官员周三表示，2013年他们曾经在土耳其边境抓到易卜拉欣·巴克拉乌伊（Ibrahim el Bakraoui）。他们表示，他们把易卜拉欣遣送到了荷兰。</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters: "Despite our warnings that this person was a foreign terrorist fighter, the Belgian authorities could not identify a link to terrorism."<br/>土耳其总统埃尔多安告诉记者：“尽管我们已经警告称这个人是一名外国恐怖分子，但比利时方面未能把他和恐怖主义联系起来。”</p>
<p>Belgian officials say the el-Bakraoui brothers were mainly known as criminals who spent time in prison.<br/>比利时官员表示，巴克拉乌伊兄弟主要被认为是坐过牢的犯罪分子。</p>
<p>But, EU Commission President Juncker urged people to support Belgium. "Who is at fault in the area of terrorism?" he asked in an interview. "Let's not start criticizing Belgium. I don't share this scorn."<br/>但是欧盟委员会主席容克呼吁人们支持比利时。他在接受采访时问到，“恐怖主义方面是谁的过错？我们不要开始批评比利时，我不赞同这种轻视。”</p>
<p><strong>Attack 'almost inevitable'<br/>袭击几乎不可避免</strong></p>
<p>Michael Hayden is a former director of the U.S. National Security Agency. He told VOA that the terror in Brussels was "almost inevitable."<br/>迈克尔·海登（Michael Hayden）是美国国家安全局前任局长。他对美国之音表示，布鲁塞尔的恐怖袭击几乎不可避免。</p>
<p>Hayden said, "If you look at what has happened...the soft targets, the transportation targets, the maximum civilian casualties, (it's) something we could see."<br/>海登表示，“如果你看看发生了什么，非武装目标、交通工具目标、最大化的平民伤亡，这就是我们能看到的。”</p>
<p>Hayden also said it is "certainly not the last" attack Islamic State will carry out. The group has a "network that seems to be active and thriving in the heart of Europe," Hayden added.<br/>海登还表示，显然这不是伊斯兰国执行的最后一起袭击。该组织拥有一个似乎在欧洲心脏地带活跃和蓬勃发展的网络。</p>

[00:00.04]European Union justice and security ministers
[00:03.64]are meeting in Brussels Thursday
[00:06.12]to discuss ways to increase intelligence and security.
[00:11.12]Terrorists carried out two bomb attacks in the Belgian capital Tuesday,
[00:16.32]killing at least 31 people and wounding 300 others.
[00:21.52]Police are searching for one additional suspect in the attacks.
[00:26.38]Officials earlier identified Khalid el-Bakraoui
[00:30.48]as the attacker in the bombing at the Maelbeek underground train station.
[00:35.64]Twenty people were killed in that explosion.
[00:38.92]Security video shows another man walking with Bakraoui.
[00:43.60]Belgian media report that police believe this second man
[00:48.12]could also have been involved.
[00:50.13]El-Bakraoui's brother Ibrahim has been officially identified
[00:55.04]as one of the two suicide bombers
[00:57.28]in the attack on the airport the same day.
[01:00.56]Media have reported the name  of the second airport bomber as Najim Laachraoui.
[01:08.12]He is a bombmaker for Islamic State
[01:11.00]and considered a main partner in the Paris terror attacks last November.
[01:16.44]A third man walking with the suicide bombers also appears in airport video.
[01:22.96]The recording shows him pushing a cart.
[01:26.60]The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the Brussels attacks,
[01:32.12]as it did for the Paris attacks in November.
[01:36.44]Police say evidence suggests increasingly closer links
[01:40.92]between the Brussels and Paris terrorist strikes.
[01:45.08]The findings are raising questions about weaknesses
[01:48.80]in intelligence sharing and security cooperation.
[01:53.56]These questions will be a major part of Thursday's EU meeting.
[01:58.52]European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker
[02:02.92]spoke to reporters in Brussels Wednesday.
[02:06.36]He described proposals for tighter border controls
[02:11.04]and measures to make it more difficult to get firearms within the EU.
[02:17.44]"We need to have a union of security," he said.
[02:21.52]Europe's visa-free system is also under increasing scrutiny.
[02:27.44]The system already is under heavy pressure from Europe's refugee crisis.
[02:32.72]Belgian officials are being pressured to explain
[02:37.32]how a terrorist network was able to plot
[02:41.04]and carry out two attacks from Belgium within months.
[02:46.08]Also, Turkish officials said Wednesday
[02:49.60]they had caught Ibrahim el Bakraoui in 2013 at the Syrian border.
[02:56.36]They said they sent him to the Netherlands.
[03:00.08]Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters:
[03:04.72]"Despite our warnings that this person was a foreign terrorist fighter,
[03:10.24]the Belgian authorities could not identify a link to terrorism."
[03:16.44]Belgian officials say the el-Bakraoui brothers
[03:19.76]were mainly known as criminals who spent time in prison.
[03:24.68]But, EU Commission President Juncker
[03:27.56]urged people to support Belgium.
[03:30.52]"Who is at fault in the area of terrorism?"  he asked in an interview.
[03:35.48]"Let's not start criticizing Belgium. I don't share this scorn."
[03:41.68]Michael Hayden is a former director of the U.S. National Security Agency.
[03:47.40]He told VOA that the terror in Brussels was "almost inevitable."
[03:52.96]Hayden said, "If you look at what has happened...the soft targets,
[03:58.32]the transportation targets, the maximum civilian casualties,
[04:02.84](it's) something we could see."
[04:05.17]Hayden also said it is "certainly not the last" attack Islamic State will carry out.
[04:11.84]The group has a "network that seems to be active and thriving
[04:16.80]in the heart of Europe," Hayden added.
