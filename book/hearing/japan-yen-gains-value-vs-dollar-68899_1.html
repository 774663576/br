。
[00:01.56]The Japanese yen has risen to its highest value
[00:05.80]in relation to the United States dollar in one and one half years.
[00:13.12]The yen is increasing in value on foreign exchange markets;
[00:18.60]yet Japanese finance officials have supported policies aimed at limiting its rise.
[00:26.36]The appreciating value of the yen
[00:30.28]could hurt Japan's efforts to increase inflation in the country.
[00:36.24]Some experts think rising prices could strengthen economic growth
[00:42.20]in the world's third largest economy.
[00:46.44]Japan's money has traded at about 111 yen to one U.S. dollar in recent days.
[00:56.04]The yen has also risen in value against other major currencies, including the euro.
[01:03.92]The yen's value has increased almost nine percent on foreign exchange markets this year.
[01:12.72]That is the biggest increase among the Group of 10 industrial countries during that period.
[01:20.48]The group includes Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
[01:30.40]The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States are also members.
[01:39.72]The Group of 10 has agreed to cooperate on economic and monetary issues
[01:46.92]with the International Monetary Fund.
[01:51.44]Japanese officials have said they may be willing to take additional measures
[01:56.48]to fight the rising value of the yen.
[01:59.96]Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga
[02:05.11]said the government is closely watching changes in foreign exchange values.
[02:12.08]The governor of Japan's central bank, Haruhiko Kuroda,
[02:17.24]has repeatedly said that the Bank of Japan may cut interest rates it controls.
[02:24.80]Demand for widely traded currencies like the yen
[02:28.80]often increases when stock prices drop.
[02:32.68]That can cause the value of such currencies to rise on international markets.
[02:40.36]However, the Bloomberg News service reports that the currencies of
[02:45.48]commodity-exporting countries like Australia
[02:49.36]and South Africa have dropped in value.
[02:53.36]Such countries sell a large amount of agricultural products
[02:58.48]and unprocessed minerals to overseas buyers.
[03:03.64]The Bank of Japan is seeking to raise inflation to a target rate of two percent a year.
[03:11.96]The bank has increased the amount of money available to private Japanese banks.
[03:18.68]The Bank of Japan also has set a negative interest rate
[03:23.16]for the money commercial banks hold with it.
[03:27.20]Both moves are meant to encourage banks to lend more to businesses and individuals.
[03:36.20]However, Japan's rate of inflation remains near zero percent.
[03:42.48]That can be a sign of limited demand for goods and services.
[03:50.00]The Swiss franc has also increased in value against the U.S. dollar.
[03:56.28]That increases the cost of the country's exports
[04:00.36]and may hurt Switzerland's economic competitiveness.
[04:05.28]The president of Switzerland's central bank
[04:08.48]said his bank's policy of negative interest rates
[04:12.52]has been "indispensable" for limiting the rising value of the franc.
[04:19.12]I'm Mario Ritter.
