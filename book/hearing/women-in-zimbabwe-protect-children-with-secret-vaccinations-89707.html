。
[00:01.96]At a health center in Zimbabwe,
[00:04.52]a large group of women holding babies
[00:07.48]hurried to take their places on wooden seats.
[00:11.80]Separately, a health worker took a different group
[00:14.68]of worried mothers and their children
[00:16.84]through a back door and into another room,
[00:19.84]quickly closing the door behind them.
[00:23.56]The women were all at the Mbare Polyclinic in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare.
[00:30.32]They came to have their children vaccinated against measles
[00:33.96]during a deadly outbreak in the southern African country.
[00:39.08]But the women in the back room were getting their children vaccinated in secret
[00:43.52]because their religion bans them from using modern medicines.
[00:48.52]Healthcare worker Lewis Foya said,
[00:51.40]"the measles outbreak saw children dying
[00:54.48]so they are now coming secretly and we are helping them."
[00:59.48]More than 700 children have died
[01:01.84]from measles in Zimbabwe in an outbreak that began in April.
[01:07.40]Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said
[01:10.64]many were unvaccinated because of religious reasons.
[01:15.72]The government has announced a vaccination drive
[01:18.80]but, as with COVID-19, some religious groups
[01:22.72]are strongly opposed to vaccines
[01:25.08]and have worked against the campaign.
[01:28.92]Apostolic churches are among those
[01:31.36]that opposed modern medicine in Zimbabwe.
[01:35.28]Followers believe in prayer, holy water
[01:38.12]and other measures to treat disease or cure illnesses.
[01:43.36]Foya said the male leadership of the church means women
[01:47.12]have "no power to openly say no" to instructions.
[01:52.24]Children are then in danger.
[01:55.12]The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF,
[01:58.80]estimates that Apostolic churches have around
[02:02.28]2.5 million followers in a country of 15 million.
[02:08.64]Some permit members to seek health care.
[02:11.32]Many still resist it.
[02:15.48]A group of Apostolic church members
[02:18.04]who are open to modern medicine
[02:20.40]has been trying to bring change.
[02:23.92]They advise women to go against church rules
[02:27.24]if it means helping their children.
[02:30.60]Debra Mpofu is a member of the Apostolic Women Empowerment Trust.
[02:36.68]She said, "We encourage women to get their children vaccinated,
[02:41.24]maybe at night. It's really necessary
[02:44.56]for the women to protect their children."
[02:48.04]At the Mbare health center, one mother said
[02:51.48]people had learned from the misunderstanding about vaccines
[02:55.28]during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[02:59.04]The mother, Winnet Musiyarira, said,
[03:01.92]"A lot of people were misinformed during that COVID-19 period...
[03:07.76]a lot of people lost their lives. So when I heard about measles I just said
[03:14.08]I have to take my kids to hospital and get them vaccinated."
[03:19.28]Mpofu of the Apostolic trust said some church groups
[03:23.52]would permit them to talk with their members
[03:25.64]and share information on vaccination.
[03:29.16]One church leader, James Katsande,
[03:32.40]also agreed to let his followers take their children to seek medical care.
[03:38.48]But there was a condition: They should come to the church's leaders
[03:42.32]for blessings before going to a health center.
[03:46.24]Worldwide, the World Health Organization and UNICEF
[03:49.92]reported a 79 percent increase in measles
[03:53.64]in the first two months of 2022.
[03:57.68]The organizations warned that large outbreaks were possible.
[04:02.40]They said children and pregnant women are most
[04:05.00]at risk of severe disease from measles.
[04:08.92]But a vaccine prevents it easily.
