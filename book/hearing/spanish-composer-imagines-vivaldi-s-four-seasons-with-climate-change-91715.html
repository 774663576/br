。
[00:00.04]Antonio Vivaldi's famous musical work,
[00:03.68]The Four Seasons, was first performed in the 1700s.
[00:09.92]Many music historians call it a "masterpiece,"
[00:13.64]the musical composer's greatest work.
[00:17.36]The composition includes four parts
[00:20.48]for the four seasons:
[00:22.44]"Spring," "Summer," "Autumn," and "Winter."
[00:27.04]Each part recalls the season it is aiming to describe.
[00:32.04]For example, the website Galaxy Music Notes
[00:36.96]says "Summer" has a "slow start,
[00:40.12]portraying the weather as too hot for any movement."
[00:45.56]"Autumn" is a "celebration of the harvest."
[00:50.28]One music director in Spain decided
[00:53.68]to interpret the 300-year-old work for modern times.
[00:58.16]The composer and producer Hache Costa
[01:03.44]told the Reuters news agency that Vivaldi's work
[01:08.44]would have been "a lot more aggressive and dirty"
[01:11.68]if it was written today.
[01:20.36]Costa said the weather is so different now
[01:23.68]that "if today someone were to compose the Four Seasons
[01:27.64]from a...realistic perspective, it would be...daring."
[01:32.68]So, he updated Vivaldi's piece to reflect the real world.
[01:38.08]The work is now being performed in Madrid
[01:41.40]at the EDP Gran Via concert hall.
[01:46.28]Reuters said he added "prominence
[01:49.36]and drama" to the summer portion
[01:51.84]and shortened the other seasons
[01:54.32]because of global warming.
[01:57.60]The musical group, or orchestra,
[02:00.20]performs the music in front of a video screen
[02:04.12]showing the effects of climate change
[02:06.76]– such as wildfires and dry weather.
[02:10.92]One part shows the clouds involved in a hurricane.
[02:16.16]Costa created the adaptation of The Four Seasons
[02:19.88]to go along with the recent Global Climate Action Day.
[02:23.88]He said he wants people listening to "feel really bothered...
[02:28.52]by becoming truly aware of what is happening."
[02:32.04]He said the sheet music is freely available for anyone to play.
[02:37.68]Ernesto Rodriguez Camino
[02:40.80]is president of the Spanish Meteorological Society.
[02:45.64]He said the effects of climate change in Spain
[02:48.36]could be "catastrophic."
[02:50.84]He said periods of high heat will last longer
[02:54.00]and bring wildfires and the chance of strong rainfall.
[02:58.56]When asked, Costa, the composer,
[03:02.32]said he did not think
[03:03.84]Vivaldi would have a problem with his changes.
[03:06.76]I'm Dan Friedell.
