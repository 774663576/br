<p>Rajiv Biswas says automobile sales have jumped over the past five to seven years because of a rise in pay among Indonesia's middle class. He expects to see a pick-up in auto sales if the economy can grow at a rate of six to seven percent a year.<br/>比斯瓦斯先生表示，由于印尼中产阶级的工资上涨，过去五到七年汽车销量已经飞涨。如果印尼经济能够以每年百分之六到七的速度增长，他预计会看到汽车销量随之上升。</p>

[ar:Jim Tedder]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]The World Economic Forum on East Asia
[00:03.26]is taking place this weekend in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
[00:08.25]IHS Global Insight studies economic conditions around the world.
[00:13.48]The company believes that, in two years,
[00:16.44]Indonesia will become Asia's latest trillion-dollar economy.
[00:21.76]Its reason: a jump in the gross domestic product or GDP,
[00:26.16]the total value of goods and services produced within a country.
[00:31.01]IHS Global Insight predicts that by 2023,
[00:36.30]Indonesia's GDP will double to two trillion dollars.
[00:41.04]It also thinks Indonesia's GDP
[00:44.19]will rise to three trillion dollars by 2028.
[00:48.83]The company expects Indonesia will have a larger
[00:52.12]gross domestic product than Russia by 2021.
[00:56.22]It says Indonesia's expanding middle class
[00:59.82]will make the country the largest market
[01:02.61]for consumer goods in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
[01:07.70]IHS Global Insight chief economist Rajiv Biswas spoke
[01:13.96]with VOA's Victor Beattie about Indonesian President Joko Widodo,
[01:19.09]also known as Jokowi.
[01:21.24]Mr. Biswas noted how the president launched a major program
[01:26.03]to improve his country's power supplies, roads and other infrastructure.
[01:32.17]"That has been very much part of his election platform,
[01:35.88]and in his early months of office,
[01:38.44]it's clear that he has a strong focus on that.
[01:41.14]And that is something that Indonesia very much needs.
[01:43.24]Indonesia is one of the Asian economies
[01:46.73]that is relatively underdeveloped in terms of infrastructure."
[01:50.73]Rajiv Biswas says the spending on ports, roads and public services
[01:57.05]will help to fuel Indonesia's economic growth.
[02:00.70]The current growth rate is five percent a year.
[02:04.60]But it was about six and one-half percent a few years ago.
[02:09.11]Mr. Biswas says the government debt to GDP rate
[02:13.85]is low for Indonesia when compared to past rates.
[02:18.06]He says the former government did a very good job
[02:22.00]in reducing government debt levels.
[02:24.25]Early in his administration, President Joko Widodo
[02:29.04]announced cuts in government fuel subsidies.
[02:33.10]For years the Indonesian government
[02:35.75]had used public spending to keep fuel prices low.
[02:40.20]The decision to cut subsidies was unpopular,
[02:44.21]but Rajiv Biswas says, it helped the economy.
[02:48.45]"The fuel subsidy reform was very, very important
[02:51.65]because it was a heavy drain on their government expenditure
[02:55.30]in a rather unproductive form
[02:57.34]of just giving fuel subsidies to the entire population ...
[03:02.00]They will also be able to divert a lot of that money
[03:04.69]that would have been spending on fuel subsidies,
[03:07.73]towards infrastructure development,
[03:09.99]which is much more productive in the long-term for the economy."
[03:13.98]Rajiv Biswas says automobile sales have jumped
[03:18.68]over the past five to seven years
[03:21.22]because of a rise in pay among Indonesia's middle class.
[03:25.53]He expects to see a pick-up in auto sales
[03:29.22]if the economy can grow at a rate of six to seven percent a year.
[03:34.23]He adds that Indonesia still rates low
[03:38.18]on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index.
[03:42.27]He says the country needs to increase manufacturing exports and create jobs.
[03:48.96]IHS Global Insight reports that more than two million young people
[03:55.08]are joining the Indonesian labor force each year.
[03:58.82]It says continued job growth is necessary to avoid the risk of social unrest.
[04:05.47]Yet the company estimates total per person GDP in Indonesia
[04:12.01]will rise from $3,400 this year to around $8,700 by 2025.
[04:21.37]It says this might give the Indonesian government a greater voice
[04:26.25]in international financial organizations
[04:29.21]and possibly the group of five nations known as BRICS.
[04:34.90]The five are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
[04:40.36]I'm Jim Tedder.
