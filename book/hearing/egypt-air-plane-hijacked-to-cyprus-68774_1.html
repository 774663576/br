[00:00.04]An EgyptAir plane was hijacked Tuesday morning
[00:04.28]and forced to land in Cyprus, Egyptian officials said.
[00:09.92]The plane was set for the short flight from Alexandria to Cairo,
[00:14.76]about 180 kilometers away.
[00:19.08]It landed instead at Larnaca airport in Cyprus,
[00:23.40]about 540 kilometers northeast.
[00:27.80]The hijacker, who held the plane and crew,
[00:31.36]threatened to blow up the plane, officials said.
[00:35.52]However, news sources said the hijacker said
[00:39.24]he wanted to speak to his former wife, who lives in Cyprus.
[00:44.80]The hijacker, identified as Seif el-Din Mustafa,
[00:49.28]later admitted that he did not have explosives.
[00:53.68]The president of Cyprus told local media
[00:56.84]a "domestic issue" was behind the hijacking.
[01:00.72]The hijacker's former wife
[01:02.92]was brought by local police to the airport to meet with him.
[01:07.20]After the plane landed in Cyprus,
[01:10.36]video showed passengers walking down the plane stairs
[01:14.16]to a bus on the ground at Larnaca International Airport.
[01:18.96]Cyprus public television reported
[01:21.48]that the hijacker was a 27-year-old Egyptian.
[01:25.68]He asked for political asylum, it said.
[01:29.96]Just before his arrest,
[01:32.28]one man was seen climbing out of the cockpit window
[01:36.08]and sliding down the side of the airplane.
[01:39.56]Egypt's civil aviation minister
[01:42.20]said security on the plane was good
[01:45.08]and the hijacker had not been able to enter the cockpit.
[01:49.20]That prevented a more serious threat, he said.
[01:52.80]Egyptian TV showed video of a man going through a metal detector
[01:57.64]and being searched at Alexandria Airport before getting on the plane.
[02:03.32]Last November, the Associated Press reported
[02:07.48]that the airport at Sharm el-Sheikh had "gaps," or holes, in security.
[02:13.16]Gaps include "a key baggage scanning device" that often is not working.
[02:19.12]The AP also said that "poorly paid policemen
[02:22.84]monitoring X-ray machines" often take bribes.
[02:26.96]At that time, a spokesman for Egypt's Aviation Ministry
[02:31.72]dismissed the stories of poor security.
[02:35.52]He told AP that "Sharm el-Sheikh is one of the safest airports in the world."
[02:41.16]But, British Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said
[02:45.24]that bag screening was insufficient at the airport.
[02:49.08]A retired senior official from Egypt's Tourism Ministry
[02:53.72]told AP that airport guards regularly skip,
[02:57.72]or avoid, security checks for friends and co-workers.
[03:02.40]Tuesday's hijacking will most likely damage Egypt's important tourism industry.
[03:09.00]It has already suffered from years of political unrest and a growing terror threat.
[03:15.33]An Islamic State affiliate in the Sinai Peninsula in October
[03:20.48]brought down a Russian passenger jet with a bomb planted on board,
[03:25.28]killing all 224 people on board.
