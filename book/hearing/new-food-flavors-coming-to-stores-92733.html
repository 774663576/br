。
[00:00.04]In New York, Van Leeuwen Ice Cream
[00:03.68]brings people in with classic flavors
[00:07.36]like vanilla and pistachio.
[00:10.36]But, sometimes, the ice cream maker adds
[00:14.20]what it calls a "shock flavor,"
[00:17.12]like Hidden Valley Ranch
[00:19.60]or pizza, to the treat.
[00:22.60]Recently, chocolate maker Hershey
[00:25.60]added pink lemonade,
[00:27.84]a summer drink flavor,
[00:30.24]to its candy Kit Kats.
[00:33.16]And Frito-Lay introduced potato chips
[00:37.04]that taste like strawberries
[00:39.48]with a little bit of bacon.
[00:42.76]Not to be outdone,
[00:44.64]Britain's food company Little Moons
[00:48.12]produced fish-and-chip mochi ice cream flavor
[00:52.28]while Walkers celebrated the holidays
[00:56.32]with a potato chip flavor of Brussels sprouts.
[01:01.44]Usually, these flavor combinations
[01:04.48]are introduced for a limited time.
[01:07.68]But sometimes the flavors are so popular
[01:11.92]that they become permanent additions.
[01:15.84]That is what happened with Frito-Lay's
[01:18.96]Flamin' Hot Dill Pickle chips in 2019.
[01:24.64]While it would be easy to say
[01:27.08]the new and surprising flavors are produced
[01:30.88]to get attention on social media,
[01:34.08]experts say there is more to the story.
[01:38.92]They say food companies are reacting
[01:41.80]to people's changing and expanding tastes
[01:45.52]while also trying to stay current
[01:48.68]and win over space in stores.
[01:52.48]Kristen Braun works for Chicago-based
[01:55.60]food and drink company Mondelez International.
[02:00.92]She says people now want more than just one flavor
[02:05.32]and "companies are finding the freedom
[02:08.04]to explore a little bit more and get more creative."
[02:13.60]Mondelez plans to release Sour Patch Kids Oreos
[02:18.68]– a kind of sweet vanilla cream-filled cookies
[02:22.52]combined with sour candies.
[02:26.12]The flavor is one of more than
[02:28.76]ten different Oreo flavors being sold this year
[02:33.12]for a limited time of nine weeks.
[02:37.24]Mark Lang teaches food marketing
[02:40.24]at the University of Tampa in Florida.
[02:44.20]He said that manufacturers and their suppliers
[02:49.20]have increased their ability to create such products.
[02:54.40]That has made it easier for them to experiment
[02:58.40]and put out limited editions more often.
[03:03.00]Kyle Shadix is a research chef
[03:06.16]for the drink company PepsiCo.
[03:08.84]He said members of Generation Z,
[03:13.20]born between 1997 and 2012,
[03:18.00]are also fueling new ideas.
[03:21.72]Shadix is currently experimenting
[03:24.76]with Mexican, Korean and Japanese flavors.
[03:30.16]"Gen Z is going to drive us faster.
[03:33.52]We're going to start to see
[03:35.72]even more exploration quicker than in the past
[03:39.92]because they're just so open to it."
[03:43.52]Experimenting with new flavors
[03:46.08]can increase sales in several ways.
[03:50.20]Sometimes they bring in new buyers to a product.
[03:54.00]And sometimes they also influence buyers
[03:58.00]to pick up more of the original flavor.
[04:01.60]Russell Zwanka is director
[04:04.68]of the food marketing program
[04:07.12]at Western Michigan University.
[04:10.08]He said, "Sour Patch Oreos sound interesting,
[04:15.28]but nobody wants to risk buying Oreos
[04:18.24]that don't taste good, so people buy both."
[04:22.48]When companies combine products,
[04:24.88]they are trying to build a link in people's minds.
[04:28.72]For example, Lang said when Pepsi
[04:32.12]combined its drink with Peeps candy flavor,
[04:35.68]it sent a message that Pepsi is current and fun.
[04:39.72]But new flavor combinations do not always work.

[05:01.88]And the "shock flavor" did not become
[05:04.84]a permanent part of his company's offerings
[05:08.16]because of their lower "eat-ability," he said.
[05:13.00]But Lang thinks the more time
[05:15.64]people spend in restaurants
[05:17.56]or trying out new foods,
[05:19.84]the more they seek out unusual flavors.
[05:24.04]He said as humans, "We like to experiment."
