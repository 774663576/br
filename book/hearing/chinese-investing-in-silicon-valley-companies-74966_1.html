。
[00:00.12]American Mark Pavlyukovskyy created a company
[00:05.41]that provides materials people can use to build their own computer.
[00:14.32]Last year, when he was searching for people to invest in his company,
[00:21.36]he wanted someone who knew the Chinese market.
[00:27.36]Pavlyukovskyy did not have to travel to Beijing or Shanghai
[00:34.12]to find people knowledgeable about China.
[00:39.04]Silicon Valley in California is home to many Chinese
[00:45.52]with money to invest in small or start-up businesses.
[00:52.08]Pavlyukovskyy was born in Ukraine.
[00:57.20]He now works in San Francisco.
[01:00.88]Last year nine people or groups invested $2.1 million in his company.
[01:10.80]One of the investors was a Chinese business based in Silicon Valley.
[01:18.84]Pavlyukovskyy said he was not just searching for investment money,
[01:25.60]but for people with "expertise and knowledge
[01:30.68]of the education market in China."
[01:34.48]His company, called Piper, sells parts for a computer that children can build.
[01:43.88]Each computer kit sells for $299.
[01:51.48]The company has sold its kits to schools in Hong Kong.
[01:57.92]More than 150,000 kits have been shipped around the world.
[02:05.68]For the past 10 years, people and groups in Silicon Valley  have invested in China
[02:15.24]as the country opened its markets and companies worked to expand there.
[02:22.68]But now Chinese companies are beginning to look outside China for places to invest.
[02:32.28]Chinese investors have already had an effect
[02:36.76]on the American real estate, energy and transportation sectors.
[02:45.00]But they have only recently begun investing in technology companies.
[02:53.52]Now, Chinese groups and individuals are investing in Silicon Valley companies.
[03:02.72]It may take longer for these deals to be profitable than in real estate,
[03:09.16]but there is a greater chance to make a lot of money.
[03:15.08]David Cao was a computer programmer in Singapore
[03:21.16]before he launched an investment company in 2014.
[03:27.56]He says "this is the very beginning."
[03:33.24]Chris Evdemon says many Chinese are investing in American companies
[03:40.84]because they believe more innovation is coming from the United States.
[03:48.76]In 2014, Evdemon launched Sinovation, the American part of Chuangxin,
[03:57.16]a leading Chinese investor in start-up companies.
[04:03.04]He has now invested in 38 new companies that deal with
[04:09.12]such things as robotics and education technology.
[04:16.00]Chinese investors are interested in companies specializing
[04:21.84]in technology to improve digital entertainment.
[04:28.72]They also would like to invest in robotics,  artificial intelligence
[04:36.20]and technologies related to the financial, health and education markets.
[04:46.36]The U.S. Department of Defense is worried that technology
[04:52.04]that could increase America's security may instead go to China.
[05:00.60]The department recently released a report about its concerns.
[05:07.64]The report questioned whether China and Chinese investors in Silicon Valley
[05:16.60]were gaining use of important technologies through their investments.
