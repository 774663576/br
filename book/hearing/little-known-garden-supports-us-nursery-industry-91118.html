<p>Olsen called the arboretum a "science-based research facility and public garden." He said the place has<strong> bred</strong> or released around 650-plus plants. They include more than 450 azaleas for landscaping, but also trees like maples, American elms, and hemlocks.</p>

<p>Kevin Conrad is a lead plant scientist at the arboretum. He said there are examples in USDA history where a gene from a plant like wheat or grapes has been able to solve a disaster or a collapse of an important agricultural crop.</p>
<p>While the scientists do their work, the public is free to explore the arboretum grounds. About 600,000 people visit the gardens each year. That is a small amount compared to the 25 million who visit the <strong>monuments</strong> and places in the National Mall.</p>
<p>Although many people may not know it, the arboretum has had a hand in developing many of the plants that are part of American landscaping.</p>

[00:00.04]Placed among the busy streets of Washington, D.C.
[00:05.08]is a large public garden that many Americans have never heard of.
[00:11.68]The U.S. National Arboretum
[00:14.52]includes a collection of flowering plants called azaleas,
[00:19.32]a field of native plants called ferns,
[00:23.24]and flowering trees in the dogwood tree area.
[00:28.80]Government scientists are in charge of the 183-hectare area.
[00:36.32]Their main goal is to strengthen the U.S. economy
[00:40.16]by making sure an important kind of agriculture,
[00:44.64]called the nursery industry, continues to perform well.
[00:50.64]"What we do is support the American nursery industry ...
[00:55.28]which is really one of the largest forms of agriculture,"
[01:00.20]said Richard Olsen, director of the National Arboretum.
[01:06.28]He said that different kinds of agriculture industry
[01:10.68]like ornamental landscapes, horticulture, and turf,
[01:15.76]"... all of that occurs in every county, in every state of the union.
[01:21.72]So, it forms a large portion of American agriculture
[01:26.52]and therefore, an important part of the economy."
[01:31.92]The most recent numbers
[01:33.88]from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA,
[01:38.96]show that the ornamental and landscape plant industry
[01:44.16]creates $13.8 billion in sales each year.
[01:49.76]The garden was established by Congress in 1927.
[01:55.92]It plays a leading part in researching and developing plants like
[02:01.48]trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses.
[02:06.44]Olsen called the arboretum
[02:08.80]a "science-based research facility and public garden."

[02:33.04]The arboretum is home to one of the largest collections
[02:37.48]of preserved seeds in the world.
[02:41.24]The National Arboretum Herbarium
[02:43.88]houses around 700,000 example seeds.
[02:49.44]They include seeds from plants
[02:52.04]that the USDA considers as economically important.
[02:58.00]Scientists collect many genetically different seeds
[03:02.20]within a kind of plant from both native and non-native plants.
[03:08.96]The reason for collecting that data
[03:11.68]is to protect plants from harmful situations like
[03:16.16]climate change, changed environments,
[03:19.52]or other new and possible risks.
[03:23.48]Kevin Conrad is a lead plant scientist at the arboretum.
[03:29.32]He said there are examples in USDA history
[03:33.52]where a gene from a plant like wheat or grapes
[03:37.96]has been able to solve a disaster

[03:45.92]While the scientists do their work,
[03:48.68]the public is free to explore the arboretum grounds.
[03:53.48]About 600,000 people visit the gardens each year.
