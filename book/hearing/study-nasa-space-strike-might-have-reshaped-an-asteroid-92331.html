。
[00:00.04]A new study suggests
[00:02.04]that an asteroid strike
[00:04.64]by an American spacecraft
[00:07.08]likely changed the shape
[00:09.56]of the targeted object.
[00:11.64]NASA crashed the DART spacecraft
[00:15.40]into the asteroid Dimorphos in 2022.
[00:20.20]The asteroid strike happened
[00:23.16]about 11 million kilometers from Earth.
[00:27.28]The experiment tested a method
[00:30.60]for changing the orbit of some asteroids
[00:34.36]to prevent them from possibly crashing
[00:37.60]into our planet in the future.
[00:40.52]NASA has said its studies of the crash
[00:45.16]showed it was successful
[00:47.52]because the force of the strike
[00:49.88]changed the asteroid's orbit
[00:52.72]around a larger asteroid Didymos.
[00:56.48]NASA's measurements also found the strike
[01:00.92]reduced the orbital period
[01:03.68]of Dimorphos by 33 minutes.
[01:07.20]Such a major crash would normally
[01:10.60]create a large crater in the targeted object.
[01:14.56]But a new study presents evidence
[01:17.72]that the crash made more than a hole
[01:20.84]– it likely changed the shape of the whole asteroid.
[01:25.60]Astronomers at the University of Bern,
[01:29.16]in Switzerland carried out the research.
[01:32.32]A study detailing the findings recently appeared
[01:36.48]in the publication Nature Astronomy.
[01:40.08]The team used a computer simulation system
[01:44.48]to study the changes to Dimorphos
[01:47.88]that resulted from the crash.
[01:50.40]The system aimed to recreate the breakup
[01:54.36]of space objects that have been hit.
[01:57.80]The researchers said their simulation method
[02:02.20]has been used in the past to recreate
[02:05.60]space objects crashing into each other.
[02:09.16]For example, the team said it confirmed
[02:13.00]the results of a Japanese spacecraft
[02:16.40]collecting a sample from the Ryugu asteroid in 2019.
[02:22.80]Sabina Raducan is with
[02:25.84]the Physics Institute of the University of Bern.
[02:29.96]She helped lead the project.
[02:32.60]Raducan described the simulation process
[02:37.00]in a statement as "computationally intensive."
[02:41.36]In total, she said 250 simulations were completed,
[02:46.96]which reproduced the first two hours
[02:50.52]after the asteroid strike.
[02:53.08]The researchers used all available information
[02:57.64]about NASA's operation.
[03:00.20]These included the predicted shape of Dimorphos,
[03:04.92]data on the strike itself,
[03:07.52]as well as the size of the cloud
[03:10.36]the crash left behind.
[03:12.80]In addition, the team aimed to estimate
[03:16.08]unknown details about the asteroid
[03:19.28]and the surrounding area.
[03:21.88]"Then what we did is check
[03:24.40]which of the simulation run outcomes
[03:27.44]most closely match observed reality," Raducan said.
[03:32.72]She added that results of the research
[03:35.96]provided clear evidence
[03:38.04]that the crash turned Dimorphos
[03:40.84]into a relatively weak "rubble pile" asteroid.
[03:45.68]Raducan explained this meant that the object
[03:49.92]is currently being held together
[03:52.64]"by the asteroid's extremely weak gravity"
[03:56.80]rather than a solid and strong mass.
[04:00.40]The researchers noted that the results of the simulation
[04:05.24]and the team's examinations
[04:08.16]partly explain why the crash was so effective
[04:12.00]in changing the path of the asteroid.
[04:15.72]Raducan said the results also persuaded the team
[04:20.52]that "the likelihood is that the crater
[04:23.92]grew to encompass the entire body itself,
[04:28.04]so that Dimorphos ended up being completely reshaped."
[04:33.40]It is therefore unlikely that a crater
[04:36.60]still exists after the crash.
[04:39.68]The researchers said the existence of a crater
[04:43.28]can be investigated further
[04:45.68]by a European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft.
[04:50.52]The spacecraft, called Hera,
[04:53.56]is preparing for a possible launch in October.
[04:57.68]ESA says Hera's cameras and instruments
[05:01.96]will carry out detailed studies of Dimorphos
[05:05.88]and the asteroid it orbits, Didymos.
[05:09.64]During the operation, the spacecraft
[05:12.52]will aim to collect the most data yet
[05:15.96]on such an asteroid system.
