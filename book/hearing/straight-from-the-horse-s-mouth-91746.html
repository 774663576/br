。
[00:00.04]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:12.12]from VOA Learning English.
[00:15.12]On today's show, we will be talking about an animal
[00:23.92]that is as impressive and beautiful
[00:26.96]as it is useful -- the horse.
[00:32.08]Today's expression is straight from the horse's mouth.
[00:37.48]"Straight from the horse's mouth"
[00:39.64]is about the way we get information
[00:42.60]and — with this expression — that means directly.
[00:49.00]When we hear something from the source,
[00:51.92]we can say we heard it first-hand.
[00:54.40]It is coming from a primary source.
[00:58.92]When we use this expression,
[01:01.12]we can drop the word "straight" if necessary.
[01:04.16]So, if you hear something from the horse's mouth,
[01:07.76]you hear it from the person
[01:10.04]who has direct personal knowledge of the information.
[01:15.52]For example, a co-worker of mine,
[01:18.32]Andrew, likes to play the piano.
[01:21.72]But don't take my word for it,
[01:24.08]let's hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
[01:27.08]ANDREW: I really like to play the piano.
[01:30.32]Thanks, Andrew!
[01:32.08]The opposite of this expression
[01:34.36]would be through the grapevine.
[01:36.60]That is a very indirect way to get information.
[01:42.84]Now, let's talk about origin.
[01:45.20]Experts are not sure how this expression started.
[01:49.60]However, there are two common explanations.
[01:53.60]One traditional explanation
[01:56.24]is about buying horses.
[01:59.48]Before buying a horse,
[02:01.32]a possible buyer would look into the horse's mouth.
[02:05.60]This is because you can tell a bit about a horse's health
[02:09.84]and age from its gums and teeth.
[02:14.80]Another explanation involves horse racing.
[02:19.68]At the horse races, people talk about
[02:23.12]which horses will win and which ones will lose.
[02:27.80]The most valuable opinions
[02:30.04]are from the people who know the horses the best –
[02:33.12]the riders and trainers.
[02:37.20]Since you can't ask the horse,
[02:39.56]these people are the next best thing.
[02:43.64]"Straight from the horse's mouth" suggests
[02:46.60]the most knowledgeable source of information.
[02:51.20]So, this expression can also mean
[02:54.04]from a reliable source.
[02:57.16]The information is coming from a trustworthy person.
[03:01.92]It may even be the definitive source,
[03:06.20]meaning the best authority.
[03:10.36]Now, let's hear the expression used in another example:
[03:15.32]A: Hey, guess what?
[03:16.60]Stella is moving to Toronto!
[03:18.56]She's so excited.
[03:20.44]B: Are you sure?
[03:22.36]She just bought a house a year ago.
[03:25.04]A: She told me herself last night over dinner.
[03:27.88]B: I just can't believe it.
[03:30.64]I mean, she also just got a promotion
[03:34.24]and a raise at her job.
[03:36.40]It doesn't make sense.
[03:38.76]A: Well, whether it makes sense or not,
[03:40.88]that's what she told me.
[03:42.68]B: Maybe you misheard her.
[03:45.20]A: I didn't.
[03:46.28]I heard it straight from the horse's mouth – Stella's!
[03:51.52]And that's all the time we have on the show today.
[03:55.04]If anyone asks you where you learned this expression,
[03:59.04]tell them you heard it straight from the horse's mouth –
[04:02.68]from VOA Learning English.
[04:06.44]Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.
