<div class="content">American students had been learning from home for more than a year during the pandemic. When they returned to in-person learning, teachers began to see more behavioral problems.
大流行期间美国学生在家里学习了一年多时间。当他们返校学习时，教师们开始看到更多问题行为。
<p>Sarah Potpinka is an art teacher at Putnam High School in Connecticut. She said, "Coming back into the building a lot of kids fell out of the good habits they had built up in previous years."
萨拉·帕平卡是康涅狄格州普特南高中的一名艺术老师。她说：“回到教室之后，很多孩子都丢掉了他们前几年养成的好习惯。”</p>
<p>Potpinka said she saw more fights and arguments among students online and in person. Some refused to wear the required face coverings. Other students broke school rules by leaving in the middle of class to meet up with friends.<br/>
帕平卡表示，她在网课和面授的学生当中都看到了更多争吵和争论。有些人拒绝佩戴口罩。还有些学生违反学校规定，在课间去和朋友会面。</p>
<p>"Obviously throughout this pandemic, the students spent a lot of time at home and because of that they lack in those social skills," said Danielle Trejo. She is a school counselor in Austin, Texas.<br/>
丹妮尔·特雷霍表示：“显然在这场大流行期间，学生们在家里呆了很长时间，因此他们缺乏这些社交技能。”她是德克萨斯州奥斯汀市的一名学校辅导员。</p>
<p><strong>Mental health crisis<br/>
心理健康危机</strong></p>
<p>Bad behavior among students is part of what experts are calling a mental health crisis among children. Even before the pandemic, research found that bad behavior in the classroom was increasing.<br/>
学生的不良行为是专家所说的儿童心理健康危机的一部分。甚至在大流行之前，研究就发现课堂上的不良行为正在增加。</p>
<p>Childhood depression is also a serious problem.<br/>
儿童抑郁症也是一个严重问题。</p>
<p>A group of mental health organizations says in a recent Hopeful Futures Campaign report that one in three students reported feeling lonely or hopeless. Half of all mental illness presents by the age of 14 but few students get the services they need. The report, released last month, also warns that suicide is the second leading cause of death among those aged 14 to 18 in 2019.<br/>
一批心理健康机构在最近发表的“希望未来运动”的报告中表示，1/3的学生报告感到孤独或绝望。一半的精神疾病在14岁时出现，但是很少有学生能得到他们所需的服务。上个月发表的这份报告还警告说，自杀是2019年14到18岁人群的第二大死亡原因。</p>
<p>Richard Douglas is a school psychologist at Putnam High School with over 30 years of experience. He agrees that the mental health crisis existed before the pandemic.<br/>
理查德·道格拉斯是普特南高中的一名心理咨询教师，拥有30多年的经验。他认同心理健康危机在大流行前就已经存在。</p>
<p>Douglas said that during the pandemic there have been many things that disrupt families. More time at home could lead to more arguments with family members. A parent or family member could have gotten sick with COVID or lost a job, leading to more stress, Douglas said. At Putnam, many students also work to help pay for housing costs.<br/>
道格拉斯表示，在大流行期间，有很多事情扰乱了家庭。更长时间呆在家里可能会导致与家人的更多争吵。道格拉斯表示，父母或家人可能感染了新冠病毒或是失业，从而导致更大的压力。在普特南高中，许多学生还打工帮助支付房租。</p>
<p>Douglas feels school officials provide enough support to deal with the crisis at Putnam. For the school of around just 250 students, there is also a counselor, social worker, and two recently hired interventionists. Interventionists help identify learning and behavioral problems among students.<br/>
道格拉斯认为学校官员提供了足够支持来应对普特南高中的危机。这所只有大约250名学生的学校还有一名辅导员、一名社工以及两名最近聘请的干预人员。干预人员帮助识别学生的学习和行为问题。</p>
<p>But many school systems around the U.S. say they need more psychologists and counselors. The Hopeful Futures Campaign report says most American states do not provide enough resources for mental health support in schools.<br/>
但是美国各地的许多学校表示，他们需要更多的心理咨询师和辅导员。“希望未来运动”的报告称，美国大多数州没有为学校的心理健康支持提供足够资源。</p>
<p>Only Idaho and the District of Columbia go beyond the nationally recommended number of one psychologist for every 500 students. In some states, including West Virginia, Missouri, Texas and Georgia, there is only one school psychologist for over 4,000 students.<br/>
只有爱达荷州和哥伦比亚特区超越了美国推荐的每500名学生配备一名心理咨询师的标准。在包括西弗吉尼亚州、密苏里州、得克萨斯州和佐治亚州在内的一些州，一名心理咨询教师要为4000多名学生服务。</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has proposed $1 billion in new federal money to help schools hire more counselors and psychologists. And school systems have used pandemic aid to add mental health services.<br/>
拜登总统提出了10亿美元的新的联邦资金，帮助学校雇佣更多的辅导员和心理咨询师。学区已经利用大流行援助来提升心理健康服务。</p>
<p>Despite behavioral problems among students after returning to in-person classes, Potpinka said the change has been better for the students. She said it is easier to keep students engaged in schoolwork face-to-face. It is also easier to seek help for them when there is trouble.<br/>
尽管返校学习后，学生的行为出现问题，但是帕平卡表示，这种变化对学生来说更好。她说，让学生当面完成课堂作业更容易。遇到麻烦时也更容易为他们寻求帮助。</p>
<p>Douglas added that school psychologists are now trying "to undo the harm that's been done" during the pandemic.<br/>
道格拉斯补充说，心理咨询教师现在正试图“消除大流行期间造成的伤害。”</p>

。
[00:00.04]American students had been learning from home
[00:03.08]for more than a year during the pandemic.
[00:06.88]When they returned to in-person learning,
[00:09.44]teachers began to see more behavioral problems.
[00:13.92]Sarah Potpinka is an art teacher at Putnam High School in Connecticut.
[00:20.04]She said, "Coming back into the building a lot of kids

[00:29.28]Potpinka said she saw more fights and arguments
[00:32.72]among students online and in person.
[00:35.80]Some refused to wear the required face coverings.
[00:40.28]Other students broke school rules

[01:02.68]Bad behavior among students is part of what experts

[01:10.52]Even before the pandemic, research found
[01:14.20]that bad behavior in the classroom was increasing.
