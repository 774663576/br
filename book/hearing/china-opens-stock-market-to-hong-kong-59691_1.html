[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]
[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.75]Investors in Hong Kong and Shanghai 
[00:09.40]may now invest in a limited group of securities 
[00:13.42]on either city's stock exchange. 
[00:16.58]C. K. Chow is the chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing. 
[00:22.84]He called the move "a breakthrough 
[00:26.08]in the opening of China's financial markets 
[00:29.15]and an important milestone in the development of Hong Kong." 
[00:33.87]He said the new way 
[00:36.85]to invest made Hong Kong a gateway 
[00:40.31]between mainland China and international investors.
[00:44.42]The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect 
[00:48.68]gives investors the ability 
[00:51.40]to buy stocks listed in mainland China. 
[00:54.35]It also permits Chinese investors to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong.
[01:00.55]There are limits, however, 
[01:03.59]to the value and the kinds of stocks that can be traded. 
[01:08.04]Investors may trade only a total 
[01:11.66]of $3.8 billion-dollars-worth of stocks each day.
[01:17.57]Julian Evans-Pritchard is a China economic expert 
[01:22.07]at Capital Economics based in Singapore. 
[01:25.80]He told VOA's Victor Beattie 
[01:29.30]that the move to open the stock exchanges 
[01:32.63]to each other was important. 
[01:35.02]But Mr. Evans-Pritchard noted that 
[01:39.33]the total value of stock 
[01:41.24]that can be traded is a relatively small quota.
[01:45.10]"The immediate impact of the scheme 
[01:47.95]is not likely to be that big and that is partly 
[01:52.03]because regulators are taking a very cautious approach 
[01:54.98]to limiting the quota to about one percent 
[01:58.18]of the market capitalization of each market."
[02:00.12]Mr. Evans-Pritchard says, 
[02:02.72]if the quota is filled, 
[02:04.71]officials may see a reason to increase it over time 
[02:09.04]and open up the exchange further. 
[02:11.78]The stock plan represents a limited reform measure.
[02:16.62]Mr. Evans-Pritchard says what is important 
[02:21.09]is that China is opening up its capital account 
[02:24.95]to foreign investment money, 
[02:26.84]which can come in or go out.
[02:29.87]China's stock market offerings 
[02:32.77]have had limited success in recent years. 
[02:36.05]The biggest public stock offering by a Chinese company, Alibaba, 
[02:41.97]took place on the New York Stock Exchange rather than within China.
[02:47.25]It was not clear if Chinese officials would approve the plan. 
[02:52.48]Mr. Evans-Pritchard notes 
[02:55.56]that the protests in Hong Kong had raised questions 
[02:59.35]about whether Chinese officials would permit the plan, 
[03:02.94]or scheme, to go forward.
[03:05.75]"I know some people had talked about the scheme 
[03:09.81]being cancelled as a result of the Hong Kong protest 
[03:12.75]as a kind of punishment. 
[03:14.44]But, I don't think that was in their interest."
[03:16.50]Michael McCormack is a financial advisor and executive director 
[03:21.34]at Z-Ben Advisors based in Shanghai. 
[03:24.94]He says the move is a major change 
[03:28.54]that could increase the number of shareholders.
[03:31.72]"I think it's likely that we're going to see 
[03:34.26]a lot of the state-owned firms in China - 
[03:36.01]companies where one branch of the government 
[03:38.31]or another owns 40 to even 80 percent of the firm - 
[03:41.60]try to sell off their shares into the market 
[03:44.15]and broaden the shareholding base. 
[03:45.82]Both inside China and internationally... 
[03:47.82]That would be the really significant change."
[03:50.48]And that's the Economics Report from VOA Learning English. 
[03:55.92]I'm Mario Ritter.
