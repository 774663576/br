。
[00:00.04]The third year of Donald Trump's presidency seems likely to be remembered more
[00:07.20]for his impeachment than for anything else.
[00:11.52]But a look at economic data shows that the United States economy expanded in 2019.
[00:21.20]In fact, many economic numbers appear to confirm much of Trump's claims about the economy.
[00:31.12]There are worries about the future.
[00:34.44]However, a tax cut and large increase in the national debt
[00:40.40]guarantee that interest payments will take up an increasing share of the federal budget.
[00:48.00]At the same time, if there is any sign of weakness in the U.S. economy, the U.S. central bank
[00:56.60]-- the Federal Reserve -- could find it does not have the tools to influence events.
[01:04.28]Trump promised to create more jobs when he campaigned for the presidency in 2016.
[01:12.40]The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the country has added about 6.8 million of them since then.
[01:23.68]During Trump's first two years in office, economic growth rose sharply.
[01:29.96]Between 2011 and 2016, the gross domestic product (GDP) increased by about 2 percent each year.
[01:41.84]In Trump's first two years, that average increased to 2.9 percent.
[01:49.12]In 2019, however, GDP appeared likely to end the year at a 2.1 percent rate of growth.
[02:00.36]Economists suggest the slowdown is partly the result of American policies in international trade.
[02:09.32]Trump announced in early December that he would order tariffs on steel from Brazil and Argentina.
[02:17.80]He also promised to put a 100 percent tariff on some imports from France.
[02:25.76]Clearly, the president is not backing away from his decision.
[02:31.68]Economists and other experts will warn that "the stock market is not the economy," and they are correct.
[02:40.40]But stock prices do show that investors' believe the economy
[02:45.36]will continue growing because they have continued to rise.
[02:51.20]In early 2019, the financial markets were coming off a period of unrest,
[02:58.00]but worries about their future growth left as the year continued.
[03:04.92]Major markets show year-to-date returns of between 20 percent and 25 percent through early December.
[03:15.68]Interest rates have been part of economic concerns since before Trump took office.
[03:22.12]With the economy growing and unemployment decreasing, most Americans expected wages would rise.
[03:31.28]That would drive up prices and lead to higher inflation.
[03:36.28]But that did not happen. While the economy was adding millions of jobs,
[03:42.76]wages did not grow and inflation has been below 2 percent.
[03:50.04]During a long period of economic growth,
[03:53.88]the federal government usually sets aside a lot of money or pays off its debt.
[04:01.52]But under Trump, that has not happened.
[04:04.76]Instead, the U.S. federal debt has increased every year and is now more the $22 trillion.
[04:16.00]The increased debt worries people because of the share of the federal budget that must be used to pay interest.
[04:25.68]Experts warn that amount will only grow if the United States enters a recession.
