。
[00:00.04]A large Swedish study
[00:02.96]has found an unexpected finding
[00:06.28]about people diagnosed with
[00:09.04]extreme fear of serious illness.
[00:13.36]It found they are more likely
[00:15.92]to die earlier than people
[00:18.64]who are not as concerned about their health.
[00:22.84]Hypochondriasis,
[00:24.88]now called illness anxiety disorder,
[00:28.60]is a rare condition with symptoms
[00:32.00]that go beyond average health concerns.
[00:36.48]People with the disorder are unable to lose their fears
[00:41.40]despite normal doctor visits and lab tests.
[00:47.36]Some may change doctors repeatedly.
[00:51.04]Others may avoid medical care.
[00:55.28]Dr. Jonathan E. Alpert
[00:57.80]of Montefiore Medical Center in New York
[01:01.88]said, "Many of us are mild hypochondriacs."
[01:06.80]But he added there are also people
[01:10.20]on the extreme side of it who are always worrying
[01:15.20]and thinking about whether they have a serious illness.
[01:20.84]People with the disorder are suffering
[01:23.48]and "it's important to take it seriously
[01:27.00]and to treat it," said Alpert,
[01:29.68]who was not involved in the new study.
[01:33.88]Treatment can include behavioral therapy,
[01:37.48]calming methods, education,
[01:40.56]and sometimes mental health medication.
[01:45.08]The researchers have found that people
[01:47.60]with the condition have an increased risk of death
[01:52.04]from both natural and unnatural causes, including suicide.
[01:58.84]Continuing stress and its effects on the body
[02:02.76]could explain some of the differences, the writers said.
[02:08.24]The study was published recently in JAMA Psychiatry.
[02:13.88]David Mataix-Cols of
[02:16.16]the Karolinska Institute in Sweden led the research.
[02:22.48]"We got lucky," he said,
[02:24.72]because the Swedish system for organizing disease
[02:28.68]has a separate entry for hypochondriasis.
[02:34.16]That permitted research on thousands of people
[02:38.16]over 24 years, from 1997 to 2020.
[02:45.20]Older research had suggested the risk of suicide
[02:49.04]might be lower for people with the condition.
[02:53.28]Mataix-Cols said their research
[02:55.80]found that statement was incorrect.
[03:00.04]In the study, the risk of suicide death
[03:03.36]was four times higher for people with the condition.
[03:08.88]They looked at 4,100 people with hypochondriasis
[03:14.12]and matched them with 41,000 people
[03:18.64]similar in age, sex, and where they lived.
[03:23.52]They used a measurement called person years,
[03:26.88]which measures the number of people
[03:29.72]and how long they were followed.
[03:32.88]Overall death rates were higher
[03:35.32]in the people with hypochondriasis,
[03:38.16]8.5 instead of 5.5 per 1,000 person years.
[03:45.64]People with the condition died younger than the others,
[03:49.64]with a mean age of 70 instead of 75.
[03:55.20]The risk of death from diseases related to body systems,
[04:00.08]such as breathing and eating, was higher.
[04:04.68]The risk of death from cancer,
[04:06.92]however, was about the same.
[04:10.40]Alpert leads the American Psychiatric Association's group on research.
[04:17.84]He said more care is needed
[04:20.32]when suggesting a patient to mental health professionals.
[04:26.00]Patients can become angry because they feel
[04:29.52]they are being accused of imagining symptoms.
[04:34.28]Alpert added, "... fortunately, there are good treatments."
