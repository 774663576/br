。
[00:00.00]Emperor Constantine the First was an ancient Roman ruler
[00:05.26]who welcomed Christianity.
[00:08.18]He helped spread the religion throughout the Roman Empire.
[00:13.27]Recently, a large, rebuilt statue of Constantine
[00:18.51]was introduced to the public in Rome.
[00:22.05]Officials revealed the 13-meter copy of the statue
[00:27.52]that Constantine had built for himself.
[00:30.89]Special technology known as 3D modelling
[00:35.07]permitted the statue's makers to create the work
[00:39.25]from scans of the nine large original marble body parts that remain.
[00:46.19]The result: a large statue of the seated emperor.
[00:51.41]Constantine is wearing special clothing
[00:55.15]and holding a scepter and orb.
[00:58.37]He looks over Rome from a side garden of the Capitoline Museums.
[01:04.57]The rebuilt statue is close to the area
[01:08.46]where the original pieces of Constantine's giant feet,
[01:13.00]hands and head are kept.
[01:16.18]Artists in Rome created the original about 1,700 years ago.
[01:22.77]Rebuilt to its original form,
[01:25.88]the statue creates wonder in people who see it.
[01:29.89]This feeling is just what Constantine wanted from his subjects,
[01:35.00]officials said at the statue's public introduction.
[01:39.83]"In this statue there's not just beauty,
[01:43.21]there's the violence of power,"
[01:45.82]said Salvatore Settis of the Fondazione Prada,
[01:50.39]the cultural and educational arm of the fashion house
[01:55.27]which financed the project.
[01:58.45]Officials did not say how much the project cost.
[02:02.66]But the Factum Foundation created the statue.
[02:06.47]The group is a nonprofit based in Madrid.
[02:10.80]It creates special digital copies of the world's famous cultural objects.
[02:17.31]"This whole dynamic about how you use technology
[02:21.50]to transform our understanding of
[02:24.42]and the importance of cultural heritage
[02:27.96]is the core mission of Factum Foundation,"
[02:31.41]said the group's founder Adam Lowe.
[02:34.90]The statue is made from several materials.
[02:38.67]The body includes resin, polyurethane and marble powder.
[02:44.14]Gold leaf and plaster make up the special clothing
[02:48.61]that goes over the body.
[02:50.92]A second version of the statue is to be put in place in northeast England.
[02:57.65]That is where Constantine guarded defenses
[03:00.89]known as Hadrian's Wall before being crowned emperor in Rome.
[03:06.72]I'm John Russell.
