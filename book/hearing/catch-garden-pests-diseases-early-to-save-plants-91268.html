。
[00:00.04]In her latest gardening story,
[00:02.88]Jessica Damiano tells of the garden pests
[00:07.16]and diseases she has seen in her plants.
[00:11.44]The Associated Press writer suggests
[00:14.40]acting quickly when combatting garden pests and diseases.
[00:20.80]When not dealt with quickly,
[00:23.60]pests and diseases can quickly grow and reproduce.
[00:30.00]That can result in less plant growth and worse health,
[00:35.32]less flower and fruit production, or even death of your plants.
[00:42.08]Her measure always begins with the gentlest treatment possible.
[00:48.52]She only intensifies her treatments when necessary.
[00:54.24]Even then, she has her limits.
[00:57.44]Damiano says she would rather lose a flower or vegetable plant
[01:03.56]than use strong chemicals.
[01:07.24]In the case of her tomato plants,
[01:10.12]Damiano caught the aphids, a pest, early.
[01:15.60]She washed them off and removed
[01:18.24]the ones that would not come off
[01:20.64]by using her fingers under moving water.
[01:25.72]They have not returned in the week since removing them,
[01:30.40]but she looks out for them every day, just in case.
[01:35.68]Had the invasion been severe or the water
[01:39.24]and finger removal method been ineffective,
[01:43.20]she would have used Neem oil.
[01:47.04]The organic oil, which comes from the seeds of the Neem tree,
[01:52.64]kills aphids by not permitting them to breathe.
[01:57.56]It is safe to use on plants that will be eaten
[02:01.40]and it is not harmful to people, animals, and birds.
[02:07.24]Still, it should be used after the sun has set
[02:11.32]when helpful insects are less active.
[02:16.00]The same day Damiano found the aphids,
[02:19.56]she found another pest called scarlet lily beetles
[02:24.04]on her Asiatic lily plants.
[02:28.20]The adult red insects feed on a grouping of plants
[02:32.88]called true lilies and fritillaries.
[02:37.72]In an earlier stage of life,
[02:40.60]called the larval stage,
[02:43.12]they cover themselves in waste.
[02:46.52]This makes them less appealing to those that would want to eat them.
[02:52.48]But the coating also protects them from chemicals,
[02:56.28]making them difficult to remove.
[03:00.68]The pests had already damaged some of her plants.
[03:05.64]To prevent more damage,
[03:08.00]she removed them by tapping them off of the plant
[03:12.08]into some water with soap and vinegar, or household cleaners.
[03:18.64]Her rhododendron, a flowering plant,
[03:22.28]were attacked by a pest called azalea bark scale last summer.
[03:29.20]She saw the white insects had come back this year.
[03:34.60]Some of the leaves were infested, so she cut them off.
[03:40.36]But because most of the leaves only had a few of the pests,
[03:45.84]she was able to remove them by touching each insect
[03:50.44]with some rubbing alcohol.
[03:54.08]By working early, Damiano slowed or stopped infestations
[03:59.80]that could have killed her plants.
[04:03.28]The same would be true for diseases,
[04:06.44]many of which also respond better to early treatments.
