。
[00:00.04]Some of the world's leading vaccine makers
[00:03.56]are developing bird flu shots to prepare
[00:07.64]for possible outbreaks of the sickness in humans.
[00:11.96]Bird flu, or avian flu, is officially known as H5N1.
[00:20.16]The virus usually spreads among different kinds of poultry.
[00:25.44]Human infections remain very rare.
[00:29.16]But most human cases have been linked
[00:32.68]to direct contact with infected birds.
[00:36.64]Now, several large vaccine developers
[00:40.64]are working on bird flu vaccines to prepare for the possibility
[00:46.60]that the virus could one day jump to humans.
[00:50.36]One current outbreak involves an avian flu version
[00:55.60]that has already killed record numbers of birds
[00:59.40]and some other infected animals.
[01:02.28]Officials at three major vaccine manufacturers
[01:07.04]told Reuters news agency they are already developing
[01:11.92]and preparing to test vaccines
[01:15.28]to protect against new bird flu variants.
[01:19.64]The companies include Britain's GSK
[01:23.80]and CSL Seqirus and U.S.-based Moderna.
[01:29.12]Other vaccine makers told Reuters they "stand ready"
[01:34.60]to begin production efforts for bird flu if necessary.
[01:39.80]In addition, there has been a push among companies
[01:43.88]to develop a vaccine to be given directly to poultry.
[01:48.08]Such a market could be much larger than the one for humans.
[01:53.68]Vaccine company officials told Reuters
[01:58.04]that hundreds of millions of bird flu shots
[02:01.72]could be manufactured within months
[02:04.60]if a new variant of the virus starts spreading among humans.
[02:10.48]Health experts have noted, however,
[02:14.04]that most new vaccine treatments for avian flu
[02:18.84]would be set aside for wealthy nations
[02:22.20]that already have existing contracts with shot makers.
[02:27.36]Many countries have pandemic plans in place
[02:32.28]that call for giving vaccines to the most vulnerable people first
[02:38.04]while supplies are limited.
[02:40.40]But during COVID-19, many vaccine-rich countries
[02:45.80]vaccinated large parts of their populations
[02:49.64]before considering sharing shots.
[02:53.48]Dr. Richard Hatchett is chief executive of the Coalition
[02:58.80]for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI),
[03:04.64]an organization that helps finance vaccine research.
[03:09.48]He told Reuters that possible human bird flu outbreaks
[03:14.92]could lead to even greater "hoarding and vaccine nationalism"
[03:20.16]than during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[03:24.48]An international agreement covering pandemic flu
[03:28.92]sets aside 10 percent of worldwide supply
[03:33.48]for the World Health Organization
[03:35.48]to share with low- and middle-income countries.
[03:39.88]But after the COVID-19 pandemic,
[03:43.60]the WHO has sought guarantees of 20 percent
[03:48.60]of the worldwide supply for use in other pandemics.
[03:53.80]The WHO says it has signed legally-backed agreements
[03:59.96]with 14 manufacturers for 10 percent of their pandemic flu vaccine.
[04:07.44]The agreements call for the vaccines to be provided
[04:12.04]as a mix of donated shots and those to be bought by the WHO.
[04:19.04]The agreements include six of the largest seasonal flu manufacturers,
[04:25.44]such as GSK, Sanofi and CSL Seqirus, the WHO said.
[04:34.72]The WHO did not comment on possible vaccine hoarding
[04:40.08]during a flu pandemic.
[04:42.16]But it said policies were being developed
[04:46.20]"so that countries can work together
[04:48.84]– not in competition with each other"
[04:52.16]to respond to such a crisis.
[04:55.52]The WHO said it was "fully confident" that manufacturers
[05:01.48]and member states would follow the policies.
