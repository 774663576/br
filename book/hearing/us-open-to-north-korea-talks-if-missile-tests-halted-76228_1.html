<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:US Open to North Korea Talks if Missile Tests Halted]

。
[00:00.20]The American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says
[00:04.92]North Korea could signal that it is ready for talks by halting its missile tests.
[00:13.72]On Monday, Tillerson said, "We've not had an extended period of time
[00:20.64]where they have not taken some type of
[00:23.56]provocative action by launching ballistic missiles."
[00:29.32]The top U.S. diplomat went on to say
[00:33.40]that the strongest signal North Korea could send
[00:37.84]would be to "just stop these missile launches."
[00:43.00]Tillerson spoke in Manilla, the Philippines, where he was taking part
[00:48.76]in a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
[00:54.48]His comments follow a United Nations Security Council vote on Saturday.
[01:01.92]All members of the council, including China and Russia,
[01:07.19]voted to place additional sanctions on North Korea
[01:11.76]for its missile tests on July 4 and 28.
[01:17.96]China, a North Korean ally, urged the country to halt its missile and nuclear tests
[01:25.84]saying the North should not "provoke international society's goodwill."
[01:33.44]The vote, Tillerson said, showed that the international community
[01:38.82]finds North Korea's actions unacceptable.
[01:43.44]He said he hoped that North Korea
[01:46.27]would choose a different pathway that would enable talks in the future.
[01:53.28]"When the conditions are right then we can sit and have a dialogue
[01:58.46]around the future of North Korea
[02:01.56]so that they feel secure and prosper economically," he said.
[02:08.64]In a statement late Sunday, the White House said President Donald Trump
[02:14.48]spoke to South Korea's president Moon Jae-in by telephone.
[02:21.12]The statement said the two leaders agreed
[02:24.30]that they would fully carry out the sanctions.
[02:28.40]They urged "the international community to do so as well."
[02:34.48]They also agreed that North Korea
[02:37.84]"poses a grave threat" to their countries and Japan.
[02:44.84]On Monday, the North Korean government denounced the new UN restrictions.
[02:52.80]North Korean state operated media
[02:56.06]said the North threatened to take revenge on the U.S.
[03:01.88]Through its media, North Korea also restated its position
[03:07.16]that sanctions will not force it to negotiate over its nuclear program.
[03:15.36]The country also threatened to take an "action of justice"
[03:20.36]although it did not say what that would be.
[03:25.20]The sanctions approved by the U.N. Security Council
[03:29.56]aim to cut about $1 billion from North Korea's
[03:34.17]$3 billion in yearly export income.
[03:39.76]The UN Security Council resolution bars North Korean exports of coal,
[03:46.60]iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood.
[03:55.64]It also bans nations from increasing the number of North Korean workers
[04:01.76]that they permit in their respective countries.
[04:05.81]The resolution says the move is to punish North Korea
[04:11.68]for using its economic gains to develop its weapons programs.
[04:18.92]The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, said the resolution was
[04:25.44]the "single largest economic sanctions package
[04:29.16]ever leveled against" North Korea.
[04:32.78]And the top U.S. diplomat for Asia, Susan Thornton
[04:38.72]noted the importance of China continuing to carry out the sanctions.
[04:45.55]Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to North Korean Foreign Minister
[04:52.84]Ri Yong Ho at the ASEAN meeting in Manila.
[04:58.32]Chinese foreign minister Wang said that he advised North Korea
[05:05.19]to seek a "double suspension" plan to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula.
[05:13.80]Such a plan calls for North Korea to stop its nuclear and missile tests
[05:20.40]in exchange for a suspension of joint military exercises
[05:26.20]between the U.S. and South Korea.
[05:31.00]However, Thornton said the U.S. is not considering ending
[05:36.84]its training exercises with South Korea.
