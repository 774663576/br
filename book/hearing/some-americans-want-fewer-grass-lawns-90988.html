[00:01.00]The area in front of Janet and Jeffrey Crouch's house
[00:06.68]in Columbia, Maryland, does not look usual for their neighborhood.
[00:13.32]That is because the Crouches do not have a grass lawn.
[00:19.24]Instead, they have some small trees and many native plants.
[00:26.04]Lawns are areas around a house or in a park
[00:30.92]that are covered with short grass.
[00:34.96]In recent years, support for replacing lawns with native plants
[00:41.36]has been increasing in the United States.
[00:45.44]The process is called rewilding.
[00:50.00]In fact, the number of Americans planning to turn part of their lawn
[00:55.84]to native wildflowers doubled between 2019 and 2021.
[01:05.08]That information comes from the National Gardening Survey of 2,061 U.S. adults.
[01:15.16]In 2019, the percentage was nine percent.
[01:19.88]By 2021, it rose to 19 percent.
[01:26.04]Paul Robbins is the writer of Lawn People:
[01:31.16]How Grasses, Weeds, and Chemicals Make Us Who We Are.
[01:37.76]He said that most people would prefer not to have lawns.
[01:44.64]"But they feel that they need to have them,
[01:47.80]or that they can't do anything about it."
[01:52.04]He added that many homeowners feel
[01:55.28]they should have lawns to please their neighbors.
[01:59.60]It can be costly to keep a lawn looking good and green.
[02:04.68]But the Crouches had to spend much more money
[02:09.64]for the right not to have one.
[02:12.48]People living in a house next to them
[02:15.88]complained to their homeowner's association, or HOA.
[02:22.40]The neighbors did not like that the Crouches did not have a grass lawn.
[02:28.72]HOAs can make rules about the plants
[02:32.20]that homeowners in a neighborhood are permitted to grow.
[02:37.64]Many HOAs require grass lawns.
[02:42.76]The HOA ordered the Crouches to pull out their native plants
[02:48.36]and put in grass. However, they refused.
[02:54.40]"We knew we were doing things
[02:56.80]that were beneficial for the environment," said Janet Crouch.
[03:02.64]She told VOA that it seemed wrong to put in only grass,
[03:07.96]which she called an environmental dead zone.
[03:12.48]Lawns are called environmental dead zones
[03:16.60]in part because they provide no food or shelter for wildlife.
[03:22.80]They also do not support pollinators like birds, bees, and butterflies.
[03:31.08]Bee populations have been getting smaller in North America
[03:36.04]and may be getting smaller around the world.
[03:40.88]Ted Steinberg is the writer of American Green:
[03:46.76]The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn.
[03:50.88]He said there are other reasons that lawns are bad for the environment.
[03:57.92]He said they require a lot of water and chemicals.
[04:02.76]Large amounts of water can remove nutrients from the soil.
[04:08.84]Steinberg said that after the water removes the nutrients,
[04:13.60]people buy even more chemicals to put on their lawns.
[04:18.08]Scientists say some of these chemicals
[04:22.28]might cause cancer and other health problems.
[04:26.84]Nancy Lawson is the writer of The Humane Gardener and Wildscapes.
[04:35.72]She is also Janet Crouch's sister
[04:38.72]and the person who urged the Crouches to put in native plants.
[04:44.64]Lawson said there are over 16 million hectares of grass lawns in the U.S.
[04:52.80]That means lawns use more water
[04:56.24]than any other irrigated crop in the country.
[05:01.56]The Crouches' battle against their HOA took three years.
[05:06.88]They say they spent $60,000 fighting to keep their natural garden.
[05:14.60]They won. Because of their efforts, the state of Maryland passed a law
[05:21.08]that lets people grow native plants instead of grass,
[05:25.24]no matter what their HOA wants.
