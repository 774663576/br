<p>Consider a time that you discussed prices. Perhaps it was at a market, at a store, or with friends.</p>
<p>How did you discuss the issue?</p>
<p>In today's <em>Everyday Grammar</em>, we will explore a point of connection between grammar and the economy. You will learn how to talk about prices in everyday situations. We will pay careful attention to questions about prices.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Everyday Grammar " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-3d6b-08db61f92ba5_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Everyday Grammar </span></div>
<p><strong>Comparison</strong></p>
<p>Let's start our lesson by comparing some of our important terms to a movie. We will call it <em>Price Questions</em>.</p>
<p>The star of our film is the structure "how much." "How much" almost always appears in questions about prices – just as a main actor appears in almost every <strong>scene </strong>of a movie.</p>
<p>If "how much" is our star, then the verb "cost" is probably the most important supporting actor. "Cost" appears in all kinds of questions.</p>
<p>But sometimes "cost" is left out of sentences – in the same way that a director might leave out other actors from a scene in a film.</p>
<p>So, we have "how much" and "cost." But our sentence or film needs a few more extras, like <strong>background</strong> performers in a scene.</p>
<p>These include pronouns or demonstratives such as "it," "this," and "that," as well as the helping verb "do." These words are important – just as background actors are – but you may not really notice them as much.</p>
<p>Now that we have introduced the crew of our film, let's see some action.</p>
<p><strong>Present</strong></p>
<p>Remember our old friend "how much," the star of the show? "How much" plays a central part in questions about prices.</p>
<p>For example, you might hear a person ask:</p>
<p><em>How much does this cost?</em></p>
<p>"How much" sets the scene for what is to come, in the same way that a main actor might enter the scene first in a film. Then, of course, we have some background actors, the helping verb "do," followed by the subject "this." And finally, we have our supporting actor, the main verb "cost."</p>
<p>The general order of appearance is this:</p>
<p><em>How much + helping verb + subject + main verb</em></p>
<p>In some cases, we leave out the helping verb "do." Instead, we simply use the verb BE. You can think of BE acting as the <strong>stunt</strong> double for "do." For example, you might hear a person ask:</p>
<p><em>How much is this?</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>How much is it?</em></p>
<p>Once again, "how much" enters the scene first, and this time our main supporting actor, "cost," does not appear. But we have the background actors BE and "it."</p>
<p><strong>Past</strong></p>
<p>We have explored price discussions in their present form. But what happens if we want to talk about the past?</p>
<p>We can still use the same structures, but there are small changes.</p>
<p>So, our question "How much does this cost?" becomes this:</p>
<p><em>How much did this cost?</em></p>
<p>Our question "How much is it?" becomes this:</p>
<p><em>How much was it?</em></p>
<p>These changes are much like an actor wearing a different costume or clothing. The actor is the same, but his or her appearance changes.</p>
<p>In the same way, we might say that verbs wear different kinds of clothing in their present or past forms.</p>
<p><strong>Practice</strong></p>
<p>Let's take some time to work with these ideas.</p>
<p>Ask about the price of a cell phone. Use the present form of the verb "cost."</p>
<p>Pause the audio to consider your answer.</p>
<p>Here is one possible answer:</p>
<p><em>How much does this cell phone cost?</em></p>
<p>Now imagine a friend showing you a cell phone that he or she recently purchased. Ask about the price by using a past form of BE.</p>
<p>Pause the audio to consider your answer.</p>
<p>Here is one possible answer:</p>
<p><em>How much was this cell phone?</em></p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Today we explored a few ways to ask questions about prices. We used the idea of a film to learn about our subject.</p>
<p>In future lessons, we will explore the grammar behind all kinds of everyday issues – prices, the economy, friendship, technology, and more.</p>
