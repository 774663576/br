[ti:ILO Wage Growth Remains Below Pre-Crisis Level]
[ar:Christopher Cruise]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.40]The International Labor Organization recently 
[00:09.88]released a report suggesting that real wage growth 
[00:14.34]in developed economies is close to unchanged. 
[00:18.68]Real wage measure includes the effects of inflation. 
[00:23.24]Developing economies are mainly responsible 
[00:28.24]for world wage growth.
[00:30.30]The ILO report says world wage growth 
[00:35.59]is below the 3 percent rate 
[00:38.56]that existed before the economic crisis of 2008. 
[00:43.51]It says wage growth has slowed to nearly zero percent 
[00:49.06]in developed economies over the last two years.
[00:53.16]Wages are growing by 6 percent in developing economies, 
[00:58.86]like China and other Asian nations. 
[01:02.53]Wage growth in Eastern Europe and central Asia is almost as high.
[01:10.15]The ILO report says wages in rich nations 
[01:15.86]are still about three times higher than in poor countries. 
[01:20.59]It says workers in developed countries earn $3,000 a month 
[01:26.93]on average compared to $1,000 a month 
[01:31.07]for workers in developing nations.
[01:33.84]Sandra Polaski is the Deputy Director-General for Policy at the ILO. 
[01:41.28]She says wages affect inequality differently in different economies.
[01:47.69]"The report shows that in many countries, 
[01:50.44]wages represent the largest source of income 
[01:52.90]for households with at least one member of working age. 
[01:55.75]In developed economies, 
[01:57.55]wages account for about 60 to 80 percent 
[02:00.54]of total income before households pay taxes. 
[02:03.48]In emerging and developing economies, 
[02:05.95]wages are about 30 to 60 percent of total household income," said Polaski.
[02:10.09]The report says developed nations had increased inequality 
[02:15.83]because of job losses and big differences 
[02:19.59]between the highest and lowest wage earners. 
[02:23.63]But differences between highest and lowest wage earners 
[02:28.19]decreased in some developing countries.
[02:30.83]The ILO says minimum wage policies -- 
[02:35.71]rules for the lowest permitted wages, 
[02:39.34]can play a strong part in dealing with poverty and inequality. 
[02:45.51]Ms. Polaski disagrees with conservative critics 
[02:50.20]of minimum wage policies. 
[02:52.26]They say higher minimum wages mean fewer jobs.
[02:57.90]"What the evidence shows is that increases in minimum wages 
[03:02.86]in the order of magnitude that we actually see, 
[03:06.17]whether in the U.S. or in other economies, 
[03:08.82]in fact do not have that negative effect on employment. 
[03:12.52]Instead, employers find ways of making up through increases 
[03:16.27]in productivity, better work organization, etc.," said Polaski.
[03:19.74]The ILO says the weakening of collective bargaining 
[03:25.13]in many countries has hurt wages. 
[03:28.14]The report says labor productivity -- 
[03:32.03]a measure of economic productivity, 
[03:35.42]continues to rise faster than wages in developed economies. 
[03:41.31]The result, says the ILO, 
[03:44.61]is that workers and their families 
[03:47.77]are seeing fewer gains than the owners of capital.
[03:52.99]And that's the VOA Learning English Economics Report.
