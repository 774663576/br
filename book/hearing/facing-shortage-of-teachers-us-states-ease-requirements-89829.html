<p>The Southern Regional Education Board is a nonprofit education group. It researched information from the years 2019 and 2020 from 11 states.

。
[00:00.04]Some schools in the southern United States
[00:03.04]are dealing with severe teacher shortages.
[00:07.32]Many of these schools are turning to teaching candidates
[00:10.96]without teaching certificates or official training.
[00:15.44]In 2019, Alabama legislators passed laws
[00:20.04]easing teacher requirements
[00:22.32]and permitting emergency certificates.
[00:26.20]The Associated Press reports
[00:28.40]that teachers without certificates
[00:30.64]often work at low-income
[00:33.28]and majority-Black school systems.
[00:37.32]Some schools in Texas eased official certification requirements
[00:42.16]for about one in five new teachers last school year.
[00:47.56]In Oklahoma, an "adjunct" program permits schools
[00:52.16]to employ teachers who do not have teacher training
[00:55.56]if they meet the local school's qualifications.
[00:59.84]And in Florida, former military members
[01:03.20]without a four-year university degree
[01:06.24]can teach for up to five years using temporary certificates.
[01:11.96]School systems decide if they will accept uncertified candidates,
[01:16.84]have crowded classes or employ part-time teachers.
[01:22.04]Maxie Johnson is a member of the board
[01:25.08]overseeing the Dallas Independent School District.
[01:29.64]He said, "I've seen what happens
[01:32.44]when you don't have teachers in the classroom.
[01:35.32]I've seen the struggle."
[01:37.88]He made the statement shortly before the school board
[01:40.80]approved expanding the use of uncertified teachers.
[01:45.52]He said that he would rather have someone
[01:47.72]that a principal approved for a teaching position.
[01:51.88]The Southern Regional Education Board
[01:54.36]is a nonprofit education group.
[01:58.12]It researched information

[02:18.48]That means they are teaching a different age group
[02:21.16]or subject than they are certified to teach.
[02:25.20]The group predicts that as many as 16 million students in the area
[02:30.00]might be taught by an unprepared or inexperienced teacher by 2030.
