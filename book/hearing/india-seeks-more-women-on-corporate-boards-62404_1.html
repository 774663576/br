[al:Economic Report]
[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English. This is the Economic Report.
[00:05.25]The goal appeared simple: 
[00:08.60]require a woman to sit on the board of directors 
[00:12.87]of all companies listed on India's National Stock Exchange. 
[00:18.46]But after one year, 
[00:20.95]many companies are still trying to fill the positions. 
[00:25.15]This has raised the issue of how well women 
[00:29.85]are represented in top leadership jobs.
[00:32.70]Indian lawmakers passed the legislation last year. 
[00:39.09]The rule is meant to ensure gender diversity 
[00:43.48]and bring attention to the issue of women in corporate leadership. 
[00:48.71]The rule required that women be named 
[00:53.30]to all corporate boards by April 1.
[00:56.93]About 150 companies out of 1,475 listed on the stock market 
[01:06.17]failed to name a woman to their boards by that date. 
[01:10.85]And nearly half the companies that did meet the requirement 
[01:16.00]appointed a female relative of a current board member.
[01:20.79]Among those companies was Reliance Industries. 
[01:26.08]It named the Chairman's wife, Nita Ambani, to the board.
[01:31.91]Pranava Haldea of the market research group, 
[01:36.95]PRIME Database in New Delhi 
[01:39.25]questions the effectiveness of the requirement.
[01:42.68]He says his organization thinks 
[01:45.58]that the female relatives will share the same ideas 
[01:48.97]and opinions as their family member on the board. 
[01:53.31]He says that defeats the purpose of diversity.
[01:56.50]Many companies argued there was a shortage 
[02:00.34]of skilled female workers able to fill the positions. 
[02:04.53]Uday Chawla is head of a professional search company, Transearch India. 
[02:12.92]It helped some companies look for candidates. 
[02:17.02]He says the difficulty was to find women 
[02:21.41]who had already served on boards.
[02:24.41]He said more professional companies want women on the board 
[02:29.30]who can add value to the board instead of just meet a requirement. 
[02:34.84]He says these companies demand competency and experience. 
[02:40.58]Mr. Chawla said there are very few women who have the experience.
[02:47.27]Others said companies simply did not take the legislation seriously 
[02:53.46]and failed to look carefully. 
[02:55.81]Yet, the inability of corporate India to find women to sit on boards 
[03:02.14]has brought attention to the low level 
[03:05.13]of women's participation in top management positions.
[03:09.53]Catalyst is a non-profit organization 
[03:14.42]that works to build inclusive workplaces. 
[03:18.26]The group released a study that said almost 50 percent 
[03:23.50]of women in corporate India leave such work 
[03:26.69]between the lowest and middle professional level. 
[03:30.30]In the rest of Asia, 29 percent of women do.
[03:35.12]Shachi Irde is the director of Catalyst India, WRC. 
[03:41.87]She says one of the reasons women leave 
[03:45.66]is that women in India are mainly responsible for family care. 
[03:50.70]She says companies need to put in place policies 
[03:55.65]to keep more women on the job.
[03:58.23]"If you really look and ensure that the women are recognized, 
[04:05.78]treated fairly, then there is a lot more of women 
[04:10.21]that you can see in your organization 
[04:11.91]rather than them dropping off. 
[04:13.70]The challenge definitely comes when organizations 
[04:17.11]don't have inclusive policies 
[04:19.41]and she is pulled between both her home responsibilities 
[04:24.75]and her office responsibilities."
[04:25.99]Ms. Irde says more women could be placed on boards 
[04:30.04]if companies do not only consider women 
[04:33.39]with experience as board members.
[04:36.38]Pranav Haldea says Indian companies 
[04:40.91]need to recognize that more women in the workplace 
[04:45.21]and in top management add value to a company.
[04:49.90]He says he does not believe more laws are the answer. 
[04:54.39]He said it is more of an effort 
[04:57.03]to change beliefs in the corporate world.
[04:59.59]Corporate boards in India 
[05:02.49]have among the lowest percentages of women members. 
[05:06.28]Women are represented most on corporate boards in Norway, 
[05:11.88]Finland and France 
[05:14.58]which have government requirements for female membership.
[05:19.18]And that's the Economic Report from VOA Learning English.
[05:26.01]I'm Mario Ritter.
