。
[00:01.08]People greet each other in many ways.
[00:04.92]They might say "hello" in different languages.
[00:09.36]They might physically do something
[00:11.72]like shaking hands, giving hugs,
[00:14.88]or exchanging kisses.
[00:17.24]Elephants seem to have many greetings too.
[00:21.28]A recent study gives new information
[00:24.88]about these greetings,
[00:26.68]including how greetings differ
[00:29.16]depending on the animals' sex
[00:32.32]and whether they are looking at each other.
[00:36.12]The study was based on observations
[00:39.24]of African savannah elephants
[00:42.00]in the Jafuta Reserve in Zimbabwe.
[00:45.76]Vesta Eleuteri of the University
[00:49.08]of Vienna in Austria
[00:51.28]was the lead writer of the study
[00:54.24]that appeared recently
[00:56.16]in Communications Biology.
[00:58.84]"Elephants live in a so-called
[01:02.00]'fission-fusion' society,
[01:04.40]where they often separate and reunite,
[01:07.84]meeting after hours, days
[01:10.76]or months apart," Eleuteri said.
[01:14.52]Elephants are Earth's largest land animals.
[01:19.32]They are highly intelligent,
[01:21.92]with strong memories and problem-solving skills,
[01:25.84]and complex communication.
[01:29.16]Female elephants of different family groups
[01:32.56]might have strong social bonds
[01:35.04]with each other, forming "bond groups."
[01:39.52]Earlier studies in the wild
[01:41.84]have reported that when these groups meet,
[01:45.24]the elephants perform special greeting ceremonies
[01:49.28]to announce and strengthen
[01:51.76]their social bonds, Eleuteri said.
[01:55.44]Male elephants have different social bonds from females.
[02:00.60]Male greetings may serve to ease possible hostility.
[02:06.28]Male elephants greet mainly by smelling each other,
[02:10.60]reaching with their trunks, Eleuteri added.
[02:15.08]The recent study gives details
[02:17.56]on around 20 movements tied to greetings.
[02:21.88]It showed that elephants mix these movements
[02:25.48]in exact ways with sounds.
[02:29.32]The different sounds are described
[02:32.20]as rumbles, roars and trumpets.
[02:37.08]The study also showed how smell plays
[02:40.36]an important part in greetings.
[02:43.60]Elephant greetings include behaviors
[02:46.64]unusual for humans,
[02:48.68]including releasing body waste.
[02:52.20]Elephants can also release secretions
[02:55.32]from a special gland.
[02:58.60]Elephants may greet each other
[03:01.00]by making gestures meant to be seen,
[03:04.16]like spreading their ears
[03:06.08]or showing their behinds.
[03:08.68]The creatures also use movements
[03:11.48]producing special sounds,
[03:14.00]or they may use movements
[03:16.04]that involve touching other elephants.
[03:19.00]Movements involving touching
[03:21.68]are known as tactile gestures.
[03:24.92]Eleuteri suggested that elephants
[03:28.20]appeared to know what other elephants can see.
[03:31.72]"They preferred using visual gestures
[03:35.44]when their partner was looking at them,
[03:38.32]while tactile ones when they were not,"
[03:41.56]Eleuteri explained.
[03:43.92]Greeting behavior has been studied
[03:46.68]in a number of animals.
[03:49.84]"Many other species greet,
[03:51.72]including different primates,
[03:53.92]hyenas and dogs," Eleuteri said.
[03:58.08]These animal greetings help guide social situations
[04:02.56]by reducing tension or confirming social bonds,
[04:07.40]Eleuteri added.
[04:09.16]The new research builds on earlier studies
[04:12.88]of elephant greeting behavior.
[04:15.28]The nine observed elephants
[04:18.32]- four females and five males - were "semi-captive."
[04:22.92]That means they freely moved
[04:25.68]around their natural environment during daytime
[04:29.44]and stayed in structures at night.
[04:32.92]Greetings used by the female elephants
[04:36.32]closely matched the behavior of wild elephants.
[04:40.52]The greeting behavior of the male elephants
[04:44.40]appeared to be different from wild male elephants.
[04:48.72]Wild male elephants are often alone,
[04:52.32]forming loose connections with other elephants.
[04:57.12]The temporal gland is midway
[04:59.80]between the eye and the ear.
[05:02.44]That gland plays a part in elephant greeting
[05:06.84]by releasing a substance called temporin.
[05:10.32]Temporin contains chemical information
[05:13.72]about an elephant's condition.
[05:16.20]Elephants often use their trunks
[05:19.04]to touch the temporal glands of others.
[05:22.92]Eleuteri said elephant body wastes
[05:26.36]"contain chemical information important for elephants,
[05:30.64]like the identity of the individual,
[05:33.88]their reproductive state or even their emotional state."
[05:38.76]"Maybe they don't need to tell each other how they're doing,
[05:43.32]as they can smell it," Eleuteri added.
