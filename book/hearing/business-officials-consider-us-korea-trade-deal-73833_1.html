<p>The business leaders want to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump not to introduce policies that harm trade between the countries.这些商界领袖想要说服美国总统川普不要推行危害美韩两国贸易的政策。</p>
<p>During the U.S. presidential campaign, Trump threatened to make changes to the bilateral free trade deal. The deal is known as the Korean U.S. Free Trade Agreement or KORUS FTA. Last year, Trump criticized the deal as "job killing."<br/>川普在总统竞选期间曾威胁要修改双边自由贸易协定。该协定被称之为美韩双边自由贸易协定（简称KORUS FTA）。去年，川普批评这一协定“扼杀就业机会”。</p>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, or AMCHAM Korea, wants to keep the current KORUS FTA. The agreement took effect in 2012.<br/>在韩美国商会（简称AMCHAM Korea）希望维持现行的美韩双边自由贸易协定。该协定于2012年生效。</p>
<p>The deal removed 95 percent of tariffs on consumer and industrial products over five years.<br/>该协定在五年间将消费与工业产品的关税减少了95%。</p>
<p>James Kim is Chairman of AMCHAM Korea. He said South Korea should consider ending some regulations on imports that hurt trade.<br/>詹姆斯·金（James Kim）是在韩美国商会的主席。他说，韩国应该考虑终止一些损害贸易的进口条例。</p>
<p>"We need to make the Korean economy more transparent and predictable, by making the regulatory process more deliberative," Kim said recently in Seoul.<br/>詹姆斯·金最近在首尔表示：“我们需要让韩国经济通过更为审慎的监管程序变得更为透明和可预测。”</p>
<p>The American car industry, for example, has said it spends a lot of time and money on unneeded environmental rules. It also says it faces regulations that often are introduced without notice or explanation.<br/>例如美国汽车行业就说过，它们在不必要的环保条例上花费了大量时间和资金。它们还称自己经常会遇到没有事先通知或说明就直接颁布的规定。</p>
<p>Fifteen percent of cars in South Korea are from foreign manufacturers. In other developed economies, such as the U.S. and European countries, foreign cars make up 40 percent of the market.<br/>韩国15%的汽车来自于进口。在美国和欧洲等其它发达经济体，进口汽车占到了市场的40%。</p>
<p>The American Automotive Policy Council says nearly 80 percent of the trade deficit with Korea is in automobile trade. That deficit was almost $28 billion in 2015.<br/>美国汽车政策委员会表示，美国对韩国贸易逆差近80%来自于汽车产业。2015年该逆差达到近280亿美元。</p>
<p>Jeffrey Jones is a former AMCHAM Korea chairman. He says Trump's statements on trade add urgency to efforts to take care of misunderstandings about trade practices. But, he says time is running out.<br/>杰弗里·琼斯（Jeffrey Jones）是前在韩美国商会主席。他说，川普的贸易声明提升了人们澄清对贸易行为的误解的紧迫性。但是他说时间所剩不多了。</p>
<p><strong>Supporters say KORUS agreement is working<br/>支持者称美韩双边自由贸易协定行之有效</strong></p>
<p>AMCHAM Korea is sending a group to Washington, D.C., to defend the current trade agreement. The group wants to speak with lawmakers about how the trade deal is working.<br/>在韩美国商会将会派遣一个代表团到华盛顿，为当前的贸易协定辩护。该代表团希望与国会议员探讨这一贸易协定是如何工作的。</p>

<p>The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association says U.S. car imports to South Korea have increased by 20 percent in two years.<br/>韩国汽车制造商协会表示，韩国进口的美国汽车在两年内增长了20%。</p>
<p>AMCHAM Chairman Kim says one way to build support for the U.S.-Korea trade agreement is to show how American exports to South Korea have increased. U.S. exports to South Korea of all products and services have risen by 8 percent in the last 10 years.<br/>在韩美国商会主席詹姆斯·金表示，争取对韩国贸易协定支持的途径之一就是展示出美国对韩出口已经有所增长。美国对韩国所有产品和服务出口在过去十年中增长了8%。</p>
<p>Exports of some agricultural products have increased sharply since the free trade agreement has gone into effect.<br/>自韩国双边自由贸易协定生效以来，一些农产品出口也大幅增长。</p>
<p>Kim notes that several Korean companies, including carmakers Hyundai and Kia, have opened factories or offices in the U.S. The Korean companies have created more than 45,000 American jobs.<br/>詹姆斯·金指出，包括现代和起亚在内的一些韩国公司已经在美国开设了工厂或办事处。这些韩国公司创造了超过4.5万个美国就业岗位。</p>
<p>Recent news reports suggest that Samsung Electronics is considering opening a new manufacturing center in the U.S.<br/>最近的新闻报道表明，三星电子公司正考虑在美国开设一家新的制造中心。</p>
<p>Trump wrote on Twitter, "Thank you, Samsung! We would love to have you!"<br/>川普在推特上写道：“谢谢三星公司！我们希望你能来！”</p>
<p>Samsung did not confirm that it would build a new factory. It did say, however, that it was making an investment of $17 billion in a semiconductor factory in Austin, Texas.<br/>三星并未确认将会建造一家新工厂。但是三星表示，该公司向德克萨斯州奥斯汀的一家半导体工厂投资了170亿美元。</p>
<p>The trade agreement between the U.S. and South Korea is bilateral, meaning between two sides. It is unlike the huge 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal from which the U.S. withdrew, or the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which Trump has also criticized.<br/>美韩之间的贸易协定是双边协定。这不同于美国退出的庞大的12国跨太平洋伙伴关系协定，也不同于川普也批评过的北美自由贸易协定。</p>
<p>Korean companies with operations in Mexico, however, are concerned they could face increased tariffs if NAFTA is renegotiated. NAFTA covers trade among Mexico, Canada and the U.S.<br/>然而在墨西哥开展业务的韩国公司担心，如果北美自由贸易协定重新谈判，他们可能会面临更高的关税。北美自由贸易协定涵盖了墨西哥、加拿大和美国之间的贸易。</p>

<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Officials Consider the US-South Korea Free Trade Deal+++有关官员仔细考虑韩国自由贸易协定]

。
[00:00.16]American business leaders are urging South Korean leaders
[00:04.80]to increase market access to U.S. companies
[00:09.16]seeking to sell goods in South Korea.
[00:13.68]The business leaders want to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump
[00:19.20]not to introduce policies that harm trade between the countries.
[00:26.08]During the U.S. presidential campaign,
[00:29.44]Trump threatened to make changes to the bilateral free trade deal.
[00:35.72]The deal is known as the Korean U.S. Free Trade Agreement or KORUS FTA.
[00:45.24]Last year, Trump criticized the deal as "job killing."
[00:51.28]The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, or AMCHAM Korea,
[00:57.84]wants to keep the current KORUS FTA.
[01:02.36]The agreement took effect in 2012.
[01:06.60]The deal removed 95 percent of tariffs on consumer
[01:12.04]and industrial products over five years.
[01:16.60]James Kim is Chairman of AMCHAM Korea.
[01:22.00]He said South Korea should consider ending some regulations  on imports that hurt trade.
[01:30.52]"We need to make the Korean economy more transparent and predictable,
[01:36.84]by making the regulatory process more deliberative," Kim said recently in Seoul.
[01:44.93]The American car industry, for example, has said
[01:50.16]it spends a lot of time and money on unneeded environmental rules.
[01:57.48]It also says it faces regulations that often are introduced without notice or explanation.
[02:06.76]Fifteen percent of cars in South Korea are from foreign manufacturers.
[02:15.16]In other developed economies, such as the U.S. and European countries,
[02:21.76]foreign cars make up 40 percent of the market.
[02:27.28]The American Automotive Policy Council says
[02:31.12]nearly 80 percent of the trade deficit with Korea is in automobile trade.
[02:38.84]That deficit was almost $28 billion in 2015.
[02:45.30]Jeffrey Jones is a former AMCHAM Korea chairman.
[02:51.16]He says Trump's statements on trade add urgency to efforts
[02:57.16]to take care of misunderstandings about trade practices.
[03:02.84]But, he says time is running out.
[03:07.12]AMCHAM Korea is sending a group to Washington, D.C.,
[03:12.12]to defend the current trade agreement.
[03:15.96]The group wants to speak with lawmakers about how the trade deal is working.
[03:23.40]South Korean officials say most problems have been solved through negotiations.
[03:30.56]They say the trade agreement also has helped the U.S. economy.
[03:37.22]The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association says
[03:42.76]U.S. car imports to South Korea have increased by 20 percent in two years.
[03:50.90]AMCHAM Chairman Kim says
[03:54.60]one way to build support for the U.S.-Korea trade agreement
[03:59.88]is to show how American exports to South Korea have increased.
[04:05.82]U.S. exports to South Korea of all products and services
[04:11.92]have risen by 8 percent in the last 10 years.
[04:17.48]Exports of some agricultural products have increased sharply
[04:22.92]since the free trade agreement has gone into effect.
[04:27.64]Kim notes that several Korean companies,
[04:31.56]including carmakers Hyundai and Kia,
[04:35.76]have opened factories or offices in the U.S.
[04:40.44]The Korean companies have created more than 45,000 American jobs.
[04:47.84]Recent news reports suggest that Samsung Electronics
[04:53.20]is considering opening a new manufacturing center in the U.S.
[04:58.96]Trump wrote on Twitter, "Thank you, Samsung! We would love to have you!"
[05:05.93]Samsung did not confirm that it would build a new factory.
[05:12.00]It did say, however, that it was making an investment  of $17 billion
[05:18.80]in a semiconductor factory in Austin, Texas.
[05:23.88]The trade agreement between the U.S. and South Korea is bilateral,
[05:30.36]meaning between two sides.
[05:34.36]It is unlike the huge 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal from which the U.S. withdrew,
[05:42.92]or the North American Free Trade Agreement,
[05:46.68]or NAFTA, which Trump has also criticized.
[05:51.53]Korean companies with operations in Mexico, however,
[05:56.52]are concerned they could face increased tariffs if NAFTA is renegotiated.
[06:04.52]NAFTA covers trade among Mexico, Canada and the U.S.
[06:12.44]I'm Mario Ritter.
