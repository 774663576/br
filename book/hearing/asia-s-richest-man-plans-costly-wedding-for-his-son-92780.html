<p>Mukesh Ambani is known as the richest person in Asia. This week, his son is getting married. But the celebrations and parties began several months ago.</p>
<p>In March, Ambani threw a three-day party before his son's wedding. The 1,200 guests included former world leaders, tech leaders, Bollywood movie stars, and even the singer Rihanna.</p>
<p>In May, the family took guests on a 3-day cruise from Italy to France. Well-known entertainers appeared on the cruise.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Nita Ambani, left, wife of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani along with his son Anant Ambani, right, and his fianc&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;233;e Radhika Merchant, center, greets guests during pre-wedding ceremony at their residence Antilia in Mumbai, India, July 3, 2024.(AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-3362-08dca03e57d1_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Nita Ambani, left, wife of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani along with his son Anant Ambani, right, and his fianc<i>&amp;#</i>233;e Radhika Merchant, center, greets guests during pre-wedding ceremony at their residence Antilia in Mumbai, India, July 3, 2024.(AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)</span></div>
<p>The main wedding will take place on July 12. Many observers have described it as the wedding of the year.</p>
<p>The <strong>groom</strong> is 29-year-old Anant Ambani. He will marry his longtime girlfriend, Radhika Merchant.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the Ambanis?</strong></p>
<p>Mukesh Ambani is 66 years old. Forbes magazine says he is currently the world's 9th richest man. The magazine reports he has a net worth of $116 billion. He is considered the richest person in Asia.</p>
<p>Ambani's business, Reliance Industries, combines several different businesses, from <strong>petrochemicals</strong> to <strong>telecoms</strong>. The Ambani family also owns a huge private apartment building in Mumbai, India. The building is worth $1 billion.</p>
<p>Ambani's critics say his company has done well mainly because of political connections to the Indian government in the 1970s and 1980s. It has also had good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.</p>
<p>The elder Ambani has started passing the business on to his two sons and daughter. The oldest son, Akash Ambani, is now chairperson of Reliance Jio, their telecoms business. Isha Ambani, the daughter, oversees the retail business. The groom, Anant, has become involved in the new energy business.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the bride and groom?</strong></p>
<p>Anant studied at Brown University in Rhode Island. He is managing the expansion of renewable and green energy interests for his family's business. He also runs a large animal rescue center called Vantara in Gujarat state.</p>
<p>The <strong>bride</strong>, Radhika Merchant is the daughter of <strong>pharmaceutical</strong> business leader Viren Merchant. She directs marketing for her father's company, Encore Healthcare.</p>
<p>Radhika told Vogue magazine that she met Anant through friends in 2017. "That first meeting just <strong>sparked</strong> something special between us, and it wasn't long before we started dating," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Wedding on July 12</strong></p>
<p>The main wedding ceremony is set for July 12, followed by a grand <strong>reception</strong> on July 14. There will be celebrations at both Ambani's Jio World Convention Center in Mumbai city and at their family home.</p>
<p>The family chose the dates using the Hindu <strong>custom</strong> for deciding lucky days.</p>
<p>Last week, videos appeared on Indian social media showing the couple's sangeet. That is a ceremony where the bride and groom's families perform dances for the guests. It included performances by Bollywood stars and pop singer Justin Bieber, who flew to Mumbai for the event.</p>
<p>The family also organized a mass wedding for more than 50 needy couples last week as part of the pre-wedding celebrations.</p>
