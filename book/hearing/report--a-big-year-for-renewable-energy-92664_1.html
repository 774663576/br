<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Report: 2023 a Big Year for Renewable Energy]

。
[00:00.04]A recent report says that 2023
[00:04.76]was a record-breaking year
[00:07.16]for renewable energy sources.
[00:10.04]Ember, a research group based in London,
[00:14.60]reported that, for the first time,
[00:18.08]30 percent of electricity produced worldwide
[00:22.28]was from clean energy sources.
[00:25.04]And billions of people
[00:27.68]are using clean energy sources daily
[00:31.04]as the number of solar and wind farms
[00:34.72]continues to grow.
[00:36.92]Last year, hydroelectric dams
[00:40.44]produced most of the clean energy sources
[00:44.12]- as in most years.
[00:46.08]Yet dry weather conditions, or droughts,
[00:49.88]in India, China, and North America
[00:53.64]meant hydropower hit a five-year low.
[00:57.88]Research shows climate change
[01:00.60]is causing droughts to develop
[01:02.88]more quickly and be more severe.
[01:06.28]People used more electricity than ever last year,
[01:11.20]about 2 percent more,
[01:13.56]an increase of about as much
[01:16.52]as Canada uses in a year.
[01:20.24]Some of this new demand was for heat pumps,
[01:24.12]which are an efficient way
[01:26.68]to both heat and cool buildings,
[01:29.56]and for electric vehicles.
[01:32.48]The demand was also for electrolyzers,
[01:36.48]special machines used
[01:38.72]to get hydrogen out of water, for energy.
[01:42.32]These are all technologies
[01:44.72]that provide solutions to climate change.
[01:48.96]Other increased demand was
[01:51.24]for electricity to feed new data centers
[01:55.00]and for air conditioning
[01:57.20]as places around the world become hotter.
[02:00.84]Solar made up the biggest part
[02:03.88]of new clean energy last year.
[02:06.88]More than twice as much solar power
[02:10.08]was added as coal power.
[02:12.68]It was the 19th year in a row
[02:16.76]that solar was the fastest-growing source
[02:20.64]of electricity generation.
[02:23.36]A large increase in solar installations
[02:27.40]happened at the end of the year
[02:30.44]and the report predicts 2024
[02:34.16]will see an even larger jump.
[02:37.64]China added more renewable energy
[02:40.60]than any other country last year
[02:43.44]— 51 percent of the new solar power
[02:47.60]and 60 percent of the new wind power worldwide.
[02:53.24]China, the European Union, the United States
[02:57.48]and Brazil together were responsible
[03:01.04]for 81 percent of new solar generation in 2023.
[03:07.24]Despite the growth in clean energy,
[03:11.00]fossil fuels like coal still made up
[03:14.64]most of the electricity generated worldwide last year.
[03:20.56]The report said some countries burned coal
[03:24.20]to make up for the loss
[03:26.32]of hydroelectric power they experienced
[03:29.76]when drought caused their water supply to dry up.
[03:34.04]China was responsible
[03:36.48]for 55 percent of coal generation worldwide.
[03:41.04]And 60 percent of China's
[03:43.72]electricity generation came from coal.
[03:48.04]China, India, Vietnam and Mexico
[03:51.96]were responsible for nearly all of the increase.
[03:55.92]The International Energy Agency
[03:59.20]says fossil fuels release more carbon dioxide
[04:02.96]to produce electricity.
[04:05.28]And scientists say fossil fuel burning
[04:09.44]needs to decrease quickly
[04:11.64]to protect Earth's climate.
[04:15.04]Experts expect the world to use
[04:17.88]even more electricity in 2024.
[04:21.92]However, as renewable energy generation
[04:25.96]is predicted to grow,
[04:28.20]it could mean a 2 percent drop
[04:30.92]in energy generated from fossil fuels.
[04:35.20]I'm John Russell.
