U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have issued<strong> </strong>more than 400 executive<strong> </strong>actions that changed America's immigration system. Some of those measures are being discussed in the days before the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Family separation </strong></p>
<p>There were reports that the federal government misplaced information about the parents of 545 migrant children. The parents were separated from their children at the U.S.-Mexico border under a Trump administration policy of "zero <strong>tolerance</strong>" for illegal border crossers. The policy was later cancelled. </p>

<p>Activists working to aid immigrants said they do not know where the children are now, or why the parents, returned to their countries of <strong>origin, </strong>cannot be found. </p>
<p>"[The children] are no longer in [Department of Homeland Security] custody, no longer in [Health and Human Services] custody, no longer in the government's custody," said Lee Gelernt. He is with the American Civil Liberties Union, a non-profit group. </p>
<p>"They [the children] were sponsored out. And that could mean [they are with] a relative who – maybe – they were lucky enough to know. It could be a very distant relative they didn't know. But it could also mean a stranger in a <strong>foster </strong>family [in the United States]," Gelernt said.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security said federal officials have not found "a single family that wants their child reunited in their country of origin."</p>
<p>Gelernt noted that, if found, the parents of the children face a horrible choice "of having either be separated permanently or bring their child back to danger [in the home countries] rather than bringing the parent back to the U.S."</p>
<p>Last year, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to reunite children with parents separated under the 2017 program. The program was part of the administration's efforts to limit asylum-seeker entry into the United States along the Mexican border.</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Court cases </strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court has set November 30 as the day to hear arguments on the administration's push to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S. <strong>Census </strong>count. Census information is used to decide how many U.S. representatives each state has in Congress.</p>
<p>Looking to next year, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases involving policies at the U.S.-Mexico border. One is about the Trump administration's decision to move federal money to pay for part of a border wall. Trump promised to build such a wall in his 2016 election campaign, but Congress, which controls public spending, refused to give him any money.</p>
<p>The second case relates to the administration's "Remain in Mexico" program. It forced asylum-seekers to await a decision on their U.S. immigration court cases on the Mexican side of the border.</p>
<p><strong>Asylum rules </strong></p>
<p>Recently, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule that blocks some groups of individuals from getting asylum. The rule would bar those jailed for a crime and those who have been found guilty of illegal reentry into the United States.</p>
<p>The rule would also block those who have illegally sheltered undocumented immigrants, used false identification or unlawfully received public financial assistance.</p>
<p>Under current immigration law, asylum-seekers who fail to ask for asylum within one year of entering the United States are barred from receiving asylum. Those tried and sentenced for a serious crime are also barred.</p>
<p>The new rule is set go into effect in November.</p>

<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, said it is moving forward with a system that bars some immigrants from asking a judge to remain in the United States.</p>

[00:02.32]U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration

[00:13.64]that changed America's immigration system.
[00:18.64]Some of those measures are being discussed
[00:22.12]in the days before the U.S. presidential election.
[00:27.68]There were reports that the federal government misplaced information
[00:33.28]about the parents of 545 migrant children.
[00:39.88]The parents were separated from their children
[00:43.44]at the U.S.-Mexico border
[00:46.20]under a Trump administration policy
[00:49.64]of "zero tolerance" for illegal border crossers.
[00:54.96]The policy was later cancelled.

[01:30.76]He is with the American Civil Liberties Union, a non-profit group.
[01:37.88]"They the children were sponsored out.
[01:41.24]And that could mean they are with a relative
