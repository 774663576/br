[00:00.04]The many school shootings across the United States
[00:03.80]have led to demand from schools
[00:06.68]for advanced technology security systems.
[00:11.40]A little over one year ago,
[00:13.68]a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas.
[00:20.28]Days later, taser maker Axon Enterprise
[00:24.12]had an idea for how to prevent such attacks.
[00:27.96]It suggested schools use "non-lethal" drones
[00:32.52]that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI).
[00:38.16]Many people who work at the company disagreed with the idea.
[00:42.76]The company's own AI ethics board quit in protest.
[00:48.16]The event showed the growing unease about the ethics and effectiveness
[00:53.56]of security tools being marketed to American schools.
[00:59.32]Schools have been able to use nearly $200 billion in new COVID-19 relief money
[01:06.24]and other government funding to purchase such tools, said Odis Johnson Jr.
[01:13.48]He is director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe
[01:17.96]and Healthy Schools in Baltimore, Maryland.
[01:22.20]More schools have more money, he said.
[01:25.20]"And there's a robust tech sector pushing these technologies."
[01:31.20]Rita Bishop is the former head of the school system in Roanoke, Virginia.
[01:36.48]She said she had to stop taking calls from companies
[01:41.24]that sell things like AI-powered surveillance cameras and weapons detectors.
[01:48.80]For some experts and school safety officials,
[01:52.64]new tech-based tools are just one way to prevent school violence.
[01:59.68]Dave Fraser is head of Omnilert.
[02:03.16]The company developed an AI-powered tool
[02:06.72]that connects to school surveillance cameras to detect guns.
[02:12.80]Charles County Public Schools in Maryland decided to use Omnilert.
[02:18.72]Jason Stoddard is the school system's security director.
[02:23.72]He said he noticed that the shooters in Uvalde
[02:27.96]and in another attack had neared the school with their guns drawn.
[02:33.20]That played a part in the school system's decision to use Omnilert.
[02:40.60]Omnilert is one of a growing list
[02:44.20]of companies offering gun-detection technologies.
[02:48.04]ZeroEyes said its gun detection technology
[02:51.84]is used in schools and other places in over 30 states.
[02:56.80]Like Omnilert, it has human reviewers
[03:00.56]who check guns that its AI system detects.

[03:08.32]more than 65 school systems have bought or tested
[03:13.48]AI gun-detection tools since 2018.
[03:18.12]The schools spent a total of over $45 million on the technologies.
[03:25.56]There are serious questions, however,
[03:28.12]about the effectiveness of such tools, said Ken Trump.
[03:32.68]He is the president of National School Safety and Security Services,
[03:38.64]a school safety consulting group.
[03:42.68]He said schools have become testing grounds
[03:45.96]for "very underdeveloped AI software."
[03:50.24]He said schools have been increasingly drawn to tech solutions
[03:54.68]without taking simple measures.
[03:58.08]He said schools have not looked to measures
[04:01.04]like training teachers on how to respond to shootings,
[04:04.76]making structural improvements to buildings,
[04:07.76]and keeping doors locked.
[04:11.32]Surveillance tools might help quicken a school's response.
[04:15.40]But they are unlikely to prevent shooters,
[04:18.76]said Johnson Jr. of Johns Hopkins.
[04:23.64]He added that there is no research into the effectiveness
[04:27.56]of these AI technologies.
[04:31.08]There are also ethical concerns.
[04:33.88]"Kids need to be in schools that treat them like students,
[04:38.44]instead of suspects," said Johnson Jr.
[04:42.92]He and other experts worry that surveillance solutions to school violence
[04:49.24]create a hostile environment.
[04:52.20]He said it could be especially negative for Black students
[04:56.08]and students from other overpoliced communities.
