[00:00.00]American investors are wondering what effect the situation in Greece 
[00:06.04]will have on the United States and its economy. 
[00:10.04]But some observers say the investors should be more worried 
[00:15.11]about the debt problems in a U.S. territory -- the island of Puerto Rico.
[00:20.56]Alejandro Garcia Padilla is the governor of Puerto Rico. 
[00:25.84]Last month, he said the territory could not pay its $72 billion public debt. 
[00:34.62]This amount includes money owed by the central government, 
[00:39.33]cities and publicly-owned businesses, like power companies.
[00:45.70]Puerto Rico is the third-largest issuer of state 
[00:50.58]and local debt in the United States. 
[00:53.19]Only California and New York have more debt.
[00:58.15]Much of the island's debt is held by individual American investors. 
[01:04.15]They got possession of it through ownership of shares 
[01:08.63]in mutual funds and other investments.
[01:12.29]Some observers say the U.S. economy could be hurt 
[01:16.84]if Puerto Rico is not able to pay its debts. 
[01:20.59]They believe the island may be unable to make its required debt payments. 
[01:27.16]If that happens, investors could ask a court 
[01:31.69]to force the territory to make the payments.
[01:35.46]Puerto Rico's debt problem has not received as much attention 
[01:40.36]as the economic crisis in Greece. 
[01:43.40]That is partly because the territory's problems are not new. 
[01:48.44]Puerto Rico has been in an economic recession since 2005. 
[01:55.14]That was when the U.S. Congress made changes to a tax program 
[02:01.25]that had given businesses financial aid for moving to the island. 
[02:06.97]In the years since the program was changed, 
[02:11.59]the territory has had to borrow money to pay its debts.
[02:16.22]Pedro Pierluisi serves as Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner 
[02:22.50]in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
[02:25.55]He wrote about the economic problems last week 
[02:30.54]in The New York Times newspaper. 
[02:33.47]He said that, on the island, "the unemployment rate, 
[02:37.64]poverty rate and median household income have always been far worse 
[02:45.94]than any state's. The main cause is inequality."
[02:51.36]He also said Puerto Rico does not have much power in Congress 
[02:57.02]because it is only a territory. 
[03:00.01]Although Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, 
[03:04.00]they do not have the right to vote in presidential elections 
[03:08.15]or elect someone to the Senate. 
[03:11.53]The territory sends a delegate to the House, 
[03:15.38]but she or he cannot vote on legislation, 
[03:19.72]except during committee meetings.
[03:22.40]Mr. Pierluisi has proposed legislation that would permit Puerto Rico 
[03:30.19]to declare bankruptcy. 
[03:32.00]American cities can ask for a court's approval to cancel debts, 
[03:38.24]but territories cannot.
