<p>The research involved 330 adults in Mali.

[00:00.04]A new study carried out in the West African nation of Mali
[00:04.28]found that an experimental drug
[00:06.84]protected adults against malaria for at least six months.
[00:12.04]The one-dose drug is the latest possible treatment
[00:15.64]for the disease spread by mosquitos.
[00:19.72]Malaria killed more than 620,000 people in 2020
[00:24.44]and sickened 241 million.
[00:27.32]They were mainly children under the age of 5 in Africa.
[00:33.08]The World Health Organization is releasing
[00:35.64]the first malaria vaccine for children.
[00:38.48]But it is just 30 percent effective and requires four doses.
[00:45.20]The new study tested a very different idea.
[00:48.56]The drug gives people a large dose
[00:51.60]of lab-made malaria-fighting antibodies.
[00:55.60]The vaccine depends on the immune system
[00:58.96]to make enough of those same infection-blockers after vaccination.
[01:05.04]Dr. Kassoum Kayentao is with the University
[01:09.16]of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies in Bamako, Mali.
[01:14.56]He helped lead the study in two small villages in Mali.
[01:19.28]He said the "available vaccine doesn't protect enough people."
[01:25.24]During malaria season in some places in Mali,
[01:28.72]people are bitten by infected mosquitoes on an average of twice a day.
[01:35.16]The experimental antibody was created by researchers
[01:38.60]at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
[01:41.80]It is given intravenously, or directly into the veins.
[01:48.24]The drug would be difficult to release to a large amount of people.
[01:52.48]But scientists are also testing a shot version of the treatment,
[01:57.16]which would be easier to give out.
[02:01.04]The U.S. government research was published Monday
[02:04.52]in the New England Journal of Medicine
[02:07.28]and was presented at a medical meeting in Seattle.
[02:12.96]The antibody works by breaking the life cycle of the parasite,
[02:16.84]which is spread through mosquito bites.
[02:20.12]It targets parasites early before they enter the liver,
[02:23.80]where they can grow and multiply.
[02:26.32]The drug was created from an antibody taken
[02:29.64]from a volunteer who received a malaria vaccine.
[02:35.04]The research involved 330 adults in Mali.
[02:39.28]The study participants got either one of two
[02:42.40]different antibody doses or a placebo
[02:45.84]– a substance given to a patient like a drug
[02:49.16]but has no physical effect on the patient.
[02:53.20]All participants were tested for malaria infection
[02:56.84]every two weeks for 24 weeks.
[03:00.36]Anyone who got sick was treated.
[03:03.96]Infections were found by blood test
[03:06.80]in 20 people who got the higher dose.

[03:14.68]Eighty-six people who got the placebo
[03:17.44]became infected during the study period.
[03:21.64]The higher dose was 88 percent effective,
[03:24.64]compared to the placebo.
[03:26.68]The lower dose was 75 percent effective.
[03:31.88]Protection might last during the several months of malaria season.
[03:37.72]The cost is not yet known.
[03:39.88]But one estimate suggests lab-made antibodies
[03:43.76]could be given for just $5 per child per malaria season.
[03:49.84]Dr. Johanna Daily is with the Albert Einstein College
[03:54.04]of Medicine in New York.
[03:56.04]She was not involved in the study.
[03:58.84]She said lab-made antibodies are used to treat cancer,
[04:03.44]autoimmune diseases and COVID-19.
[04:08.32]"The good news is now we have another, immune-based therapy
[04:12.28]to try to control malaria," she said.
