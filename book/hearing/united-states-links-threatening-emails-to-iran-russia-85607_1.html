<div class="content">U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday that Iran and Russia have both tried to interfere with the 2020 presidential election.
美国国家情报总监约翰·拉特克利夫周三表示，伊朗和俄罗斯都试图干预2020年美国总统大选。
<p>Ratcliffe made the announcement at a news conference that also included Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Wray. The announcement came just two weeks before the Nov. 3 election day. It showed the level of concern among top U.S. officials about foreign attempts to influence the results of the 2020 presidential election.
拉特克利夫在一场新闻发布会上宣布了这一消息，与会者还包括联邦调查局局长克里斯·雷。该消息的宣布是在11月3日美国大选日的前两周。它显示了美国高层官员对外国企图干预2020年总统大选结果的关注程度。</p>
<p>"We have confirmed that some voter registration information has been obtained by Iran, and separately, by Russia," Ratcliffe said during the news conference.<br/>
拉特克利夫在新闻发布会上表示：“我们已经确认伊朗和俄罗斯各自都获得了一些美国选民登记信息。”</p>
<p>Most of that voter registration information is available to the public. But Ratcliffe said government officials "have already seen Iran sending...emails designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest and damage President Trump." Ratcliffe was speaking of emails sent Wednesday designed to look like they came from the pro-Trump Proud Boys group.<br/>
这些选民登记信息中的大部分是向公众公开的。但是拉特克利夫表示，政府官员“已经看到正在伊朗发送旨在恐吓选民、煽动社会动荡并伤害川普总统的电子邮件。”拉特克利夫谈到的是周三冒充亲川普的“骄傲男孩”组织发出的电子邮件。</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies had previously warned that Iran might interfere to hurt Trump and that Russia was trying to help him in the election.<br/>
美国情报机构此前警告说，伊朗可能会干预以伤害川普，而俄罗斯会试图为川普助选。</p>
<p>Outside experts said that if Ratcliffe was correct, Iran would be trying to make Trump look bad by calling attention to support and threats by the Proud Boys. The group supports white nationalism and has ties to other hate groups.<br/>
外部专家表示，如果拉特克利夫所说无误，伊朗一定是在试图引起人们关注“骄傲男孩”的支持和威胁，从而破坏川普的形象。该组织支持白人民族主义，并与其它仇恨组织有关联。</p>
<p>Some of those emails contained a video that claimed to show how false ballots could be submitted. Ratcliffe said that claim was false. The emails are under investigation.<br/>
其中一些电子邮件中包含了一段视频，声称演示如何提交虚假选票。拉特克利夫称这个说法是错误的。这些电子邮件正在调查中。</p>
<p>Alireza Miryousefi is a spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations. He denied Iran has tried to interfere in the U.S. election. He said in a statement, "Iran has no interest in interfering in the U.S. election and no preference for the outcome."<br/>
阿里雷扎·米尔尤塞菲是伊朗驻联合国代表团的发言人。他否认伊朗曾试图干预美国大选。他在一份声明中表示：“伊朗对干预美国大选没兴趣，对选举结果也没有偏好。”</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he disagreed with Ratcliffe that Iran was specifically trying to hurt Trump. He told the television network MSNBC, "It was clear to me that the intent of Iran in this case and Russia in many more cases is to basically undermine confidence in our elections."<br/>
美国参议院民主党领袖查克·舒默表示，他不同意拉特克利夫认为的伊朗特意试图伤害川普的观点。他对微软全国广播公司节目表示：“在我看来，伊朗和俄罗斯大部分情况下的意图是从根本上破坏我们对选举的信心。”</p>
<p>Trump administration spokesman Judd Deere said Trump has directed government agencies to fight "any attempts to interfere in U.S. elections." He added that "because of the great work of our law enforcement agencies we have stopped an attempt by America's adversaries to undermine our elections."<br/>
川普政府发言人贾德·迪尔表示，川普政府已经指示政府机构打击“任何干预美国大选的企图。”他还表示：“由于我们执法机构的出色工作，我们阻止了对手破坏美国大选的企图。”</p>
<p>One intelligence source told Reuters that U.S. officials suspect the Iranian government was involved, but that the evidence does not yet prove it.<br/>
一位情报人士对路透社表示，美国官员怀疑伊朗官员参与其中，但是证据尚未证明这一点。</p>
<p>A second government source said U.S. officials have evidence that Russia and Iran had tried to hack into voter registration information in unidentified states. But the source added that the hacking may only have been aimed at avoiding payment for the information.<br/>
另一位政府消息人士表示，美国官员有证据表明，俄罗斯和伊朗曾试图入侵未确认的一些州的选民登记信息。但是该消息人士还说，黑客攻击可能仅仅只是为了避免支付这些信息的费用。</p>

。
[00:00.04]U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe
[00:04.88]said on Wednesday that Iran and Russia have both tried
[00:10.84]to interfere with the 2020 presidential election.
[00:17.44]Ratcliffe made the announcement at a news conference
[00:21.44]that also included Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Wray.
[00:29.60]The announcement came just two weeks before the Nov. 3 election day.
[00:37.44]It showed the level of concern among top U.S. officials about foreign attempts
[00:44.96]to influence the results of the 2020 presidential election.
[00:52.52]"We have confirmed that some voter registration information
[00:57.44]has been obtained by Iran, and separately, by Russia,"
[01:03.56]Ratcliffe said during the news conference.
[01:08.40]Most of that voter registration information is available to the public.
[01:15.84]But Ratcliffe said government officials "have already seen Iran
[01:21.40]sending...emails designed to intimidate voters,
[01:26.20]incite social unrest and damage President Trump."
[01:33.76]Ratcliffe was speaking of emails sent Wednesday
[01:38.16]designed to look like they came from the pro-Trump Proud Boys group.
[01:46.00]U.S. intelligence agencies had previously warned
[01:50.56]that Iran might interfere to hurt Trump
[01:54.48]and that Russia was trying to help him in the election.
[02:00.72]Outside experts said that if Ratcliffe was correct,
[02:05.24]Iran would be trying to make Trump look bad
[02:09.36]by calling attention to support and threats by the Proud Boys.
[02:16.28]The group supports white nationalism and has ties to other hate groups.
[02:24.76]Some of those emails contained a video
[02:28.40]that claimed to show how false ballots could be submitted.
[02:34.44]Ratcliffe said that claim was false.
[02:38.64]The emails are under investigation.
[02:43.60]Alireza Miryousefi is a spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations.
[02:51.68]He denied Iran has tried to interfere in the U.S. election.
[02:58.84]He said in a statement, "Iran has no interest in interfering
[03:04.68]in the U.S. election and no preference for the outcome."
[03:11.64]U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he disagreed
[03:17.16]with Ratcliffe that Iran was specifically trying to hurt Trump.
[03:23.64]He told the television network MSNBC,
[03:27.84]"It was clear to me that the intent of Iran in this case
[03:32.40]and Russia in many more cases
[03:35.40]is to basically undermine confidence in our elections."
[03:42.48]Trump administration spokesman Judd Deere
[03:45.68]said Trump has directed government agencies to fight
[03:50.12]"any attempts to interfere in U.S. elections."
[03:55.76]He added that "because of the great work of our law enforcement agencies
[04:01.12]we have stopped an attempt by America's adversaries
[04:05.32]to undermine our elections."
[04:09.72]One intelligence source told Reuters that U.S. officials
[04:14.56]suspect the Iranian government was involved,
[04:18.08]but that the evidence does not yet prove it.
[04:23.24]A second government source said U.S. officials have evidence
[04:28.00]that Russia and Iran had tried to hack
[04:31.52]into voter registration information in unidentified states.
[04:37.28]But the source added that the hacking
[04:40.92]may only have been aimed at avoiding payment for the information.
