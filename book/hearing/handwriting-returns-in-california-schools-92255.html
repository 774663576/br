。
[00:00.04]Starting this year, six- to twelve-year-olds in California
[00:06.00]will be required to learn cursive handwriting.
[00:11.32]The return to handwriting comes after many years
[00:15.44]in which typing on computer keyboards was taught
[00:19.88]and handwriting was pushed aside.
[00:24.40]Cursive is a kind of handwriting
[00:27.16]in which all the letters in a word
[00:29.84]are connected to each other.
[00:33.08]Assembly Bill 446 requires that handwriting
[00:38.68]be taught to 2.6 million Californian students
[00:44.08]in grades one through six.
[00:46.80]And it requires cursive lessons
[00:50.08]in grades three and above.
[00:53.68]Former elementary school teacher Sharon Quirk-Silva
[00:58.92]supported the bill and California Governor
[01:02.88]Gavin Newsom signed it into law in October.
[01:08.84]Experts say learning cursive improves brain development,
[01:13.76]reading skills, and hand movement.
[01:17.88]Some educators also find value in teaching children
[01:22.88]to read historic documents
[01:25.20]and family letters from past generations.
[01:30.28]Pamela Keller teaches grades four to six
[01:33.92]at Orangethorpe Elementary School in Fullerton
[01:38.88]about 50 kilometers southeast of Los Angeles.
[01:44.56]She said she was already teaching cursive
[01:48.00]before the law took effect on January 1.
[01:53.36]Some children complain about the difficulty,
[01:56.72]but Keller has a ready answer:
[01:59.88]"We tell them, well, it's going to make you smarter,
[02:04.60]it's going to make some connections in your brain,
[02:08.20]and it's going to help you move to the next level.
[02:13.16]And then they get excited because students
[02:16.28]want to be smarter. They want to learn," Keller said.
[02:21.92]During a recent visit to the school library,
[02:25.36]Keller said one student got excited
[02:28.88]seeing an image of the U.S. Constitution,
[02:32.72]written in 1787, saying, "It's cursive!"
[02:39.04]Several of Keller's students say the subject was difficult,
[02:43.84]like the letter Z, but they enjoyed it anyways.
[02:49.44]"I love it, because I just feel it's fancier...to write,
[02:53.92]and it's fun to learn new letters,"
[02:56.84]said Sophie Guardia, a 9-year-old in the fourth grade.
[03:02.72]In teacher Nancy Karcher's class,
[03:05.72]her third-grade students said, "It's fun,"
[03:09.28]"Now I can read my mom's writing,"
[03:11.96]and "It's for my secrets."
[03:16.00]As computers and smart devices grew in popularity,
[03:20.96]cursive writing was pushed aside.
[03:24.80]In 2010, the national Common Core education standards

[04:46.60]She said research has shown
[04:49.64]that learning cursive supports several linked skills
[04:53.84]that improve childhood development.
[04:58.00]Zoroya said, "You're using different neural networks

[05:06.28]And so, it's creating those pathways in your brain."
[05:11.28]Zoroya said she got the idea
[05:14.08]from former California Governor Jerry Brown.
