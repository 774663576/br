<p>Now, the VOA Learning English program <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>There are certain times of the year when we stop and think about all the things that make us happy or bring us joy. Some people even make a list of these things. In English, we have a saying for this: <strong>to count your blessings.</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Pen Pu (center) and Chelsea Peng play with their three-year-old son Dore Peng at the Chinese Garden of Friendship in Sydney, Australia, 2015.

<p>When we count our blessings, we note all the wonderful things in our lives. This helps us to <strong>appreciate</strong> how good life is.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is a time when many Americans count their blessings. The United States observes this holiday on the fourth Thursday in November.</p>
<p>Counting your blessings is important. It shows that you are <strong>grateful</strong>. <strong>Gratitude</strong> is a feeling of appreciation or thanks. When people count their blessings, they can say it like this: "I am thankful for my family. I am thankful for my friends. I am thankful for my health."</p>
<p>It is better to be grateful for our blessings than to <strong>take them for granted</strong>. When we take something for granted, we do not appreciate<strong> </strong>it. Sometimes we are not appreciative of our good fortune and blessings until they are gone.</p>
<p>But now, let's take a step back. What exactly is a blessing?</p>
<p>In English, the word "blessing" has at least two meanings. As we said, a blessing is something that brings you happiness or helps you. To religious people, a blessing is approval and help from a higher <strong>source</strong> -- God.</p>
<p>A blessing can also be a sign of approval. It gives you permission to do something. For example, a traditional marriage custom involves a blessing. If a young man wants to marry a young woman, he may want to first get her family's blessing.</p>
<p><strong>Give thanks for small blessings</strong></p>
<p>Now, when we want to show our recognition of all the little things that prove helpful, we sometimes say "<strong>give thanks for small blessings</strong>." We often say this expression in the middle of a troubling or difficult time.</p>
<p>So, let's say a friend of yours is angry about a flat <strong>tire</strong> on his car. But then he stops and thinks for a minute and says, "Well, at least I have a car. I should count myself lucky and give thanks for small blessings."</p>
<p>Now, not all blessings are simple and easy to recognize. Some are more complex than others. That brings us to the expression "<strong>mixed blessing</strong>."</p>
<p><strong>Mixed blessing</strong></p>
<p>A mixed blessing is something that is both good and bad. For example, being really beautiful can be a mixed blessing. On one hand, you look great and may be treated really well by <em>some</em> people. On the other hand, you look great and may be treated badly by <em>other </em>people. So, when we use this expression, we often use the terms "on one hand" and "on the other hand."</p>
<p><strong>B</strong><strong>lessing in disguise</strong></p>
<p>Here is another blessing expression. It is a little more complicated: <strong>a blessing in disguise. </strong></p>
<p>First of all, a <strong>disguise</strong> hides something that you do not want seen or noticed. For example, a secret agent might wear a disguise to hide her identity. Or a bottle of <strong>perfume</strong> might disguise an unpleasant smell.</p>
<p>So, a blessing in disguise is a bad event or situation. But the outcome or result is actually good.</p>
<p>Here's how to use the expression <strong>blessing in disguise</strong>.</p>
<em>So how was your high school reunion?</em>
<em>Oh, I got sick and couldn't go. </em>
<em>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. </em>
<em>Actually, it was a blessing in disguise. It turns out my two best friends from high school couldn't go either. So, we're going to take another trip together next month. </em>
<em>That sounds like even more fun.</em>
<em>It will be! They are the only people I wanted to see anyway. </em>
<em>Hey, how's everything going? I haven't seen you in a while.</em>
<p><em>Things are great! For starters, I got fired last month.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh. Sorry. So, why are things great? Getting fired is terrible.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, yes. But this time it was truly a blessing in disguise. You see, after I was fired I found a new job -- a better job that I really love. And it pays more.</em></p>
<p><em>Good for you! I'm glad you're able to count your blessings!</em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have this week for <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Now it's time for you to "count your blessings." What are you thankful for? You can tell us in the Comments Section.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>
<p><em>When I am worried and I can't sleep<br/>
I count my blessings instead of sheep<br/>
And I fall asleep </em><em>counting my blessings...</em></p>
<p><em>Anna Matteo wrote this story for VOA Learning English. George Grow was the editor. The song at the end is "Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep) sung by Krista Branch.</em></p>
