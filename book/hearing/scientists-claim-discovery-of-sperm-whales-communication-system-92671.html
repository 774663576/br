<p>"We're now starting to find the first building blocks of whale language," said David Gruber. He is founder and president of the Cetacean Translation Initiative. The nonprofit group uses machine learning and robotics to try to understand the communication of sperm whales.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47221-8">study</a> was published in the <strong>journal</strong> <em>Nature Communications.</em> The researchers examined more than 8,700 recordings of sperm whale clicks, known as codas.

<p>Pratyusha Sharma is the study's lead researcher. She said the whales can combine the phonetic alphabet in an unlimited number of ways.</p>
<p>"It doesn't appear that they have a fixed set of codas," said Sharma. She is an artificial intelligence and computer science expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "That gives the whales <strong>access</strong> to a much larger communication system," she added.</p>
<p>Sperm whales have brains that weigh about nine kilograms. They have the biggest brains of any known animal.

<p>Gruber said sperm whales seem to have highly developed social ties. Understanding their communication system could show similarities with human language and society.</p>
<p>In Dominica, there is a population of about 200 sperm whales. To get enough samples of clicks, scientists set up underwater recording equipment with <strong>microphones</strong> at different levels.

[00:00.04]Researchers say they can explain
[00:02.52]how sperm whales that live around
[00:04.88]the Caribbean island of Dominica
[00:07.40]might be communicating.
[00:10.28]Like many whales and dolphins,
[00:12.64]sperm whales are highly social mammals.
[00:15.80]They communicate by squeezing air

[00:20.28]That creates fast clicking sounds.
[00:23.68]The clicks are also used
[00:25.80]in the process of echolocation,
[00:28.32]which helps the whales find food.
[00:32.60]For years, scientists have been trying

[00:40.40]While they still do not know,
[00:43.00]they now think the clicks
[00:44.68]make up a "phonetic alphabet"
[00:46.32]that the whales use.
[00:47.92]The researchers said the whales
[00:51.00]use the sound to make what are equivalent
[00:53.84]to words and phrases.
