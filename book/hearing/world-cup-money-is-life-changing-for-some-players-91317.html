<p>Hildah Magaia is on South Africa's team, and was a big part of its advance out of group play into the knockout round. The team calls Magaia "Breadwinner." The term is often used to describe someone who earns the money needed to support their family.</p>
<p>The South African players doubled their payout. Magaia says she plans to use the money to care for her mother.</p>
<p>"I'll be able to do everything for my mother because I'm the one who's taking care of her," she said. "I'm the breadwinner, so I'll be doing everything for my mom."</p>
<p>Deneisha Blackwood plays for Jamaica. It lost to Colombia in the knockouts. She said the <strong>minimum</strong> pay was a good start for her team, which has had serious financial difficulties.</p>
<p>"A lot of us have bills to pay and family to take care of," Blackwood said, "and I think for the younger generation, especially, football doesn't make you a lot of money. So for (girls) to see us doing what we love and realize that you can make a living off it — it's <strong>motivational</strong>."</p>
<p>In June, FIFA said it would provide $110 million in prize money for players of the Women's World Cup. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the money would be sent to soccer's governing bodies, called federations. They would be responsible for awarding it. Infantino said he could not guarantee that the money would reach the players.</p>
<p>FIFPRO is an organization that represents international players. The organization said late Tuesday that it was assisting Nigeria's national team players in a dispute with their federation concerning earnings dating back as far as 2021.</p>
<p>"The team is extremely <strong>frustrated</strong> that they've had to <strong>pursue</strong> the Nigeria Football Federation for these payments before and during the <strong>tournament</strong>," FIFPRO said. "It is regrettable that players needed to <strong>challenge</strong> their own federation at such an important time in their careers."</p>
<p>Before the World Cup, South African players boycotted a game against Botswana because bonuses were not included in their contracts. Patrice Motsepe, president of the African Football Confederation, agreed to give $320,000 to the players to be divided equally. The dispute was settled.</p>
<p>Nigerian player Uchenna Kanu said the money was not the team's main goal --- playing well was.</p>
<p>"But of course, if we get paid that much money, of course, it'll have a huge<strong> impact</strong> on our lives," Kanu said. "We have families, we have things to take care of with money. That's important for us as well."</p>
<p>The total prize money at this Women's World Cup is more than three times the $30 million that was paid out at the 2019 Women's World Cup in France. But it is still far less than the $440 million in prize money for the Men's World Cup in Qatar last year.</p>
