。
[00:00.00]Apple announced its new iPhones last week,
[00:03.99]but competitors' mobile phones can do many of the same things for less money.
[00:10.55]The new iPhone 8 and X have wireless charging,
[00:16.01]edge-to-edge glass screen and dual cameras.
[00:20.61]But all of these features are already available in smart phones
[00:25.99]from China's Huawei and Oppo, and Korea's Samsung.
[00:31.21]While Apple asks buyers to pay $1,000 for its high-end model,
[00:38.76]some Asian phone makers can offer similar features for less.
[00:44.30]At one time, Chinese manufacturers copied features
[00:50.15]and designs from others to produce low-cost phones.
[00:55.32]But they have now added high-end features to their phones
[01:00.52]and they control nearly half the global mobile phone market.
[01:05.82]MediaMarktSaturn is Europe's biggest electronics seller.
[01:12.09]A spokesperson for the store told Reuters that,
[01:17.94]"Huawei is seen as a relevant competitor to Apple
[01:22.10]and Samsung (by) covering all major price points
[01:26.51]and placing big investments in marketing and sales."
[01:31.66]She also said that the Chinese companies Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo
[01:39.29]and TCL were among the top-10 best-selling smartphones in its stores.
[01:47.25]Chinese manufacturers' fast growth has been fueled by strong sales in China.
[01:54.96]But they now export 40 percent of their smartphones.
[02:00.73]That is almost double the number from just three years ago,
[02:06.66]according to the Hong Kong investment company CLSA.
[02:11.68]Huawei is currently the world's third largest phone maker
[02:16.93]behind Samsung and Apple.
[02:20.22]According to research company Canalys, 
[02:23.75]the Chinese company is getting closer to second-place Apple

[03:25.87]The special edition Mi MIX 2 sells for $720.
[03:33.08]Also, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are working to add ultrasound sensors

[04:50.95]$600 compared to just 3 percent for Huawei,
[04:56.43]according to research from the Swiss bank UBS.
