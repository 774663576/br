<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Stem Cells Used to Create Embryo Models to Study Early Human Development]

。
[00:00.04]Scientists say they have successfully created
[00:04.96]embryo models designed to support research
[00:09.88]on early human development.
[00:13.72]The models are made from stem cells –
[00:17.28]simple cells in the body that can develop
[00:20.88]into one of many specialized cells.
[00:24.64]Researchers say the embryo models cannot grow into babies.
[00:31.20]But they are meant to be complete enough
[00:34.64]to provide information about what might be going on
[00:39.20]in the embryo during a pregnancy.
[00:43.52]The use of embryo models permits scientists
[00:47.96]to carry out research without the ethical concerns
[00:52.24]linked to experiments using real embryos.
[00:56.20]Several groups are working on the research.
[00:59.96]Teams from the United States and England
[01:03.08]shared their work in two studies that recently appeared
[01:07.52]in the publication Nature.
[01:10.16]Other scientists in Israel and China
[01:14.32]published studies on their work earlier this month.
[01:18.16]Those studies, however,
[01:21.08]have not yet been examined by a wider community of scientists.
[01:27.32]Insoo Hyun is an ethicist and director of life sciences
[01:32.88]at Boston's Museum of Science.
[01:36.04]He is also a member of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School.
[01:42.76]Hyun told The Associated Press
[01:46.04]that past research has centered on a process
[01:49.68]that creates "pre-embryos" designed to behave like real embryos.
[01:56.36]But the latest creations model an embryo
[02:00.24]after it has reached the uterus.
[02:03.00]Real human embryos can be extremely hard to see at that point in the process
[02:09.72]because they attach themselves deep into the uterus.
[02:14.32]Each team's models differ in how complete they are, Hyun said.
[02:20.84]For these kinds of models, scientists use a kind of stem cell
[02:26.44]that is able to develop into many different kinds of cells or tissues in the body.
[02:33.20]They can be formed from embryos or reprogrammed from adult tissues.
[02:39.80]The writers of several studies described models
[02:44.28]that look similar to human embryos
[02:47.44]nine to 14 days after fertilization.
[02:51.80]Berna Sozen studies developmental stem cell biology
[02:57.08]at Yale University in Connecticut.
[03:00.40]She told The Associated Press,
[03:03.36]"If we can experimentally model this period,
[03:07.44]then we can finally start asking questions
[03:11.00]about how human development happens
[03:13.76]in those very early stages
[03:16.80]that are normally hidden within the body of the mother."
[03:21.80]Sozen added that scientists should be able to use the models
[03:27.16]to study embryonic failure, developmental disorders and pregnancy loss.
[03:34.24]Currently, scientists do not understand a lot
[03:38.72]about how those things happen, she said.
[03:43.40]Another study was led by Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz,
[03:48.20]an expert in stem cell biology
[03:51.36]at the California Institute of Technology
[03:54.48]and the University of Cambridge in England.
[03:58.16]She said the model her group worked with
[04:01.64]appears similar to embryo development
[04:05.08]up to 14 days from fertilization.
[04:09.56]The researchers say that model contains embryonic tissues
[04:14.68]and other tissues that can produce structures
[04:18.28]surrounding the embryo, such as the placenta and yolk material.
[04:24.24]The placenta is a structure that develops in pregnancy
[04:29.20]and attaches to the uterine wall.
[04:32.32]In the future, Zernicka-Goetz said researchers
[04:36.92]could use human embryo models
[04:39.76]to explore the effects of the environment
[04:42.92]and chemicals on early human development.
[04:47.60]Yale University's Sozen said scientists
[04:51.68]could also test drugs on embryo models
[04:55.60]and combine them with germs in experiments
[04:59.56]that currently cannot be done on pregnant individuals.
