。
[00:00.04]Dorothy Jean Tillman II of Chicago, Illinois
[00:05.52]took her first college class at age 10.
[00:09.76]This month, she became the youngest person
[00:13.40]to earn a doctorate
[00:15.28]in integrated behavioral health
[00:18.40]at Arizona State University.
[00:21.56]When she completed her study program,
[00:24.12]she was 17.
[00:26.44]Arizona State professor Leslie Manson
[00:29.68]told the television program Good Morning America,
[00:33.32]"It's a wonderful celebration, and we hope ...
[00:37.28]that Dorothy Jean inspires more students."
[00:41.72]And she added, "But this is still something
[00:45.12]so rare and unique."
[00:48.48]Her friends and family, though,
[00:50.16]call Tillman by another name,
[00:52.64]"Dorothy Jeanius."
[00:55.12]A "genius" is a very smart person.
[01:00.08]When most students her age
[01:02.16]were still in middle school,
[01:04.00]Tillman took classes through
[01:06.44]the College of Lake County in northern Illinois.
[01:10.48]She studied psychology
[01:12.72]and completed her associate's degree in 2016.
[01:18.04]She earned a bachelor's in humanities
[01:20.68]from New York's Excelsior College in 2018.
[01:25.96]About two years later, she finished
[01:29.20]her master of science degree
[01:31.60]from Unity College in Maine.
[01:34.92]In 2021, she started work
[01:38.00]on her doctoral degree at Arizona State.
[01:42.24]Most of her work has been done online
[01:44.52]while living at home.
[01:45.84]Tillman told the Associated Press
[01:49.36]that she credits her mother and grandmother
[01:51.52]for her educational success.
[01:54.56]"Everything that we were doing
[01:56.44]didn't seem abnormal to me or out of the ordinary
[01:59.84]until it started getting all of the attention," said Tillman.
[02:04.92]But she did not get to do
[02:07.00]all the normal things for young people.
[02:10.00]"I didn't have the everyday school things
[02:12.36]like (school) dances or spirit weeks
[02:15.56]or just school pictures and things like that ..." she said.
[02:20.12]She did find time for a dance program
[02:22.96]and started an organization called
[02:25.20]the Dorothyjeanius STEAM Leadership Institute.
[02:30.40]STEAM stands for "science,
[02:32.96]technology, engineering, arts and math."
[02:36.04]The program helps young people
[02:38.16]interested in those subjects during school breaks.
[02:42.24]Now that she has finished her studies,
[02:44.92]Tillman who is now 18,
[02:47.40]plans to work on raising money
[02:49.52]to expand her organization.
[02:51.64]She hopes to bring it to other places beyond Chicago.
[02:55.72]Manson, the Arizona State professor,
[02:59.08]said Tillman is creative and energetic,
[03:02.48]and that she is "a true leader."
[03:05.24]Her mother Jimalita Tillman
[03:08.20]said she is proud of her daughter's ability
[03:11.76]to deal with success
[03:14.24]while making good choices
[03:15.88]between taking part in social activities and her studies.
