。
[00:00.04]March 20 is the United Nations'
[00:04.16]International Day of Happiness.
[00:06.68]For many years, northern European countries,
[00:11.04]especially Finland, have been named
[00:14.08]among the happiest countries on Earth.
[00:18.08]The United States has never made it into the top 10.
[00:22.60]But California state lawmaker Anthony Rendon
[00:27.16]is hoping he can do something about happiness
[00:31.24]in the most populous American state.
[00:35.12]In his free time, Rendon likes to stay away
[00:38.52]from the workplace and spend time
[00:41.44]with his 4-year-old daughter
[00:44.00]at his home near Los Angeles.
[00:47.44]Recently, he took her ice skating
[00:49.96]and to an indoor play area.
[00:52.80]He said those are the "things that make me happy."
[00:57.92]As one of the longest-serving leaders
[01:00.76]in the California legislature,
[01:03.20]Rendon is now trying to make happiness
[01:06.16]more central to policymaking
[01:09.04]in his last year in office.
[01:11.48]He created a first-in-the-nation group
[01:15.04]to study the issue of happiness.
[01:18.00]The group is called the Select Committee
[01:21.96]on Happiness and Public Policy Outcomes.
[01:26.28]Rendon said it would be "silly" for lawmakers
[01:30.60]to not study how they can make people happier.
[01:34.80]"Because if we have everybody clothed,
[01:38.68]everybody housed, everybody has a job
[01:42.76]and they're miserable, then we've failed
[01:46.48]at what we're trying to do," he said.
[01:50.24]In California, three-quarters of adults
[01:53.72]say they are "very happy" or "pretty happy."
[01:57.84]Twenty-six percent say they are "not too happy."
[02:02.44]The numbers come from a September 2023 study
[02:07.40]by the Public Policy Institute of California.
[02:12.16]The study also says Californians
[02:15.32]without a post-high school degree
[02:18.88]and those who earn less money
[02:22.00]are generally less happy than those
[02:25.44]with more education and more money.
[02:29.52]The idea of considering happiness
[02:32.08]in public policy is not new.
[02:35.04]The South Asian nation of Bhutan
[02:38.08]sets happiness as a goal of its public policy.
[02:42.84]The country asks its people
[02:46.00]about their level of happinessfor what is called
[02:49.84]the Gross National Happiness Index.
[02:53.36]Officials then work to increase happiness
[02:58.00]by providing citizens with
[03:00.60]free health care and education.
[03:03.88]They also work to protect things
[03:06.36]like cultural traditions
[03:08.56]and the country's forests.
[03:12.16]Phuntsho Norbu is consul general of Bhutan
[03:15.76]to the United States.
[03:17.60]Norbu said the government
[03:19.64]cannot make every person happy.
[03:22.16]But he said the government should
[03:24.80]"create the right conditions"
[03:26.96]to help people find happiness.
[03:31.16]In California, lawmakers
[03:33.64]recently heard from experts about
[03:36.60]the things that make people happy
[03:38.72]and how public officials
[03:40.88]can support people's happiness.
[03:44.24]Meliksah Demir is a professor of happiness
[03:47.56]at California State University, Sacramento.
[03:51.36]Demir said research shows that leisure activities,
[03:56.16]social relationships and life situations
[03:59.84]affect a person's happiness.
[04:02.48]He added that public officials can help
[04:06.08]by investing in mental health resources,
[04:09.56]adding green spaces and teaching about
[04:13.36]the value of happiness early on in schools.
[04:18.20]Rendon said California is
[04:20.44]behind many parts of the world
[04:22.76]in looking at happiness in policymaking.
[04:26.60]He said he wanted to create the happiness committee
[04:30.20]after seeing a yearly report on happiness

[04:55.92]Scandinavian countries, including Finland
[04:59.60]and Iceland, ranked the highest.
