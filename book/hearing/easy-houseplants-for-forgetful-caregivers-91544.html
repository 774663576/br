[00:00.04]Jessica Damiano is an expert at taking care of plants.
[00:06.80]She writes stories about how to keep plants
[00:10.40]in good condition for The Associated Press.
[00:15.48]But even she has killed houseplants.
[00:19.16]Damiano said she has killed plants like a Monstera,
[00:24.68]a snake plant, an African violet
[00:27.32]and more orchids than she would like to admit.
[00:32.60]She said it is not that she does not know
[00:35.84]how to take care of these houseplants,
[00:39.00]she just neglected them.
[00:42.24]She added that the plants are among the hardest to keep alive.
[00:48.00]As a result, Damiano chooses houseplants
[00:51.84]that need the least amount of care for her home.
[00:56.52]She looks for plants that deal well with too little water,
[01:01.00]that grow well with limited light,
[01:03.64]and can be moved around.
[01:06.72]Also, these sorts of houseplants
[01:09.68]are best for beginners to grow.
[01:13.32]Damiano's spider plant needs only two things:
[01:17.88]moderate to bright sunlight and moist soil.
[01:23.28]She said she keeps it by a window,
[01:26.12]and she pours in whatever water
[01:28.80]she has left over from the night.
[01:32.24]Some days, she does not water the plant.
[01:35.60]And the spider plant creates many plants for replanting,
[01:40.80]even with one or two fertilizer treatments a year.
[01:46.20]Another plant, a pothos,
[01:48.84]is perfectly happy nowhere near a window.
[01:53.36]It gets the light it needs
[01:55.20]from a kind of light bulb called an LED.
[02:00.36]She gives the plant a good amount of water
[02:03.52]each time the soil completely dries out.
[02:07.84]She said the plant is doing well,
[02:10.24]with leaves growing halfway to the floor.
[02:14.44]Chinese evergreen is a beautiful houseplant
[02:17.96]that does well in low-light conditions.
[02:22.12]Damiano said all you need to do
[02:24.88]is keep the plant's soil lightly moist at all times
[02:29.64]and fertilize every other month over the winter
[02:33.72]and every month for the rest of the year.
[02:37.84]Catching Z's means to sleep.
[02:40.96]And the ZZ plant, Zamioculcas zamiifolia,
[02:46.48]requires so little care
[02:49.20]that you can almost sleep while taking care of it, Damiano said.
[02:55.36]It does not like a lot of water or bright light.
[03:00.24]Make sure the soil drains well.
[03:02.88]The plant actually does best in low-light conditions.
[03:09.00]The cast iron plant is about as resistant as its name sounds.
[03:15.56]Damiano said it does not even want your attention.
[03:20.68]Avoid providing too much sunlight.
[03:23.48]It prefers electric light or light from a north-facing window.
[03:30.92]Permit the soil to dry out between waterings
[03:34.24]and fertilize every other month in summer
[03:37.76]and autumn and just once during the winter.
[03:42.76]One houseplant, the aloe plant,
[03:45.72]can be used for treating burns.
[03:49.12]When needed, just cut open a leaf

[04:00.96]but also the plant, reducing its dependency on you.
[04:06.84]Just place it by a window that provides bright,
[04:09.96]indirect sunlight and water every three weeks,
[04:14.28]and less often during winter.
