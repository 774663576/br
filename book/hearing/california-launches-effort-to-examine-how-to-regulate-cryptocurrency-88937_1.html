<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:California Launches Effort to Examine How to Regulate Cryptocurrency]

。
[00:00.04]California has become the first American state
[00:05.16]to launch an official effort to examine
[00:09.52]how to regulate digital monies.
[00:13.16]The effort began when Governor Gavin Newsom
[00:17.96]recently signed an executive order calling on state agencies
[00:24.04]to start considering new regulations.
[00:27.96]The order also requires officials
[00:32.08]to find safe ways to widely adapt
[00:35.80]the use of digital currencies
[00:39.28]– also called cryptocurrencies – across the state.
[00:44.48]A cryptocurrency is a form of money
[00:48.64]that does not exist in physical form.
[00:52.16]Governments and banks do not oversee it.
[00:56.64]A network of computers records
[01:00.52]cryptocurrency activity between users.
[01:04.84]This activity is included in a "ledger,"
[01:09.36]or list, known as the blockchain.
[01:13.16]U.S. President Joe Biden ordered similar national action in March.
[01:20.72]Biden's order directed federal agencies
[01:25.20]to consider regulatory measures for cryptocurrencies.
[01:30.60]It also urged the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank,
[01:36.44]to explore whether it should create its own digital currency.
[01:41.64]California has the largest economy in the United States.
[01:47.68]Officials see the state as a good candidate
[01:52.36]for developing cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.
[01:57.88]Dee Dee Myers is a top economic advisor to Governor Newsom.
[02:04.84]She told The Associated Press she thinks the technologies
[02:10.36]can be "an explosive creator" of new companies and jobs in California.
[02:17.68]She added that since the industry is still developing,
[02:23.04]it provides "another reason we want to engage early."
[02:28.36]Governor Newsom, a member of the Democratic Party,
[02:33.24]said in a statement that governments often fall behind
[02:38.32]in technology development.
[02:41.20]"So we're getting ahead of the curve on this."
[02:45.40]He added that his order is designed to start a process
[02:50.96]that aims to help citizens and businesses
[02:55.24]gain economically from cryptocurrencies.
[02:59.28]California has a population of about 39 million people.
[03:06.04]The state's economy is worth more than $3.1 trillion,
[03:12.60]larger than those of Britain and India.
[03:17.08]Newsom said the state hopes to "establish a comprehensive,
[03:23.56]thoughtful, and harmonized regulatory
[03:27.44]and business environment" for cryptocurrencies.
[03:31.80]The use of cryptocurrencies has sharply increased in recent years.
[03:38.88]An estimated 16 percent of American adults have invested in,
[03:45.00]traded, or used cryptocurrencies, the AP reports.
[03:51.12]The percentage is much higher among younger individuals.
[03:57.24]There is much debate over the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies,
[04:03.56]even among some of the world's wealthiest people.
[04:08.08]Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk
[04:12.68]is a strong supporter of the technology.
[04:16.44]But billionaire investor Warren Buffet recently said
[04:21.76]he would not pay even $25 for all of the world's bitcoin,
[04:28.44]the most popular cryptocurrency.
[04:31.92]Each bitcoin is currently valued at about $37,000,
[04:38.92]but the rate rises and falls greatly.
[04:42.92]Hilary Allen is a financial regulation expert
[04:47.96]and professor at American University in Washington, D.C.
[04:53.72]She told the AP that California's effort can help
[04:58.56]legitimize the technology and make it more widespread.
[05:04.00]However, Allen said California's move to expand
[05:09.56]and regulate cryptocurrencies may not be the best thing
[05:14.48]for the state and its population.
[05:18.00]She said one reason for this is that private investors
[05:23.64]are most likely to benefit from the technology.
[05:27.64]Allen urged state officials to seek simpler technological solutions,
[05:35.52]rather than turning to technology that, in her words,
[05:40.68]"is by its very nature complex and inefficient."
