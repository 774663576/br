美联社-NORC公共事务研究中心以及MeriTalk网站进行了这项研究。调查发现，64%的美国人表示他们的社交媒体活动不安全。还有差不多的人对共享其实际位置的网络信息有着相同的安全担忧。一半美国人还认为他们的私人短信并不安全。</p>

。
[00:00.04]Americans do not believe their personal information
[00:04.04]is safe online, suggests findings from a new poll.
[00:09.28]They also are not satisfied
[00:12.12]with the federal government's efforts
[00:14.44]to protect such information.
[00:17.88]The Associated Press-NORC Center
[00:21.32]for Public Affairs Research and MeriTalk did the polling.
[00:27.92]It found that 64 percent of Americans
[00:31.76]say their social media activity is not secure.
[00:37.00]About as many have the same safety concerns
[00:41.20]about online information that shares their physical location.
[00:47.60]Half of Americans also believe
[00:50.64]their private text messages are not secure.
[00:55.36]They are not just concerned.
[00:57.92]They want the federal government to do something about it.
[01:02.92]Almost 75 percent of Americans
[01:06.88]say they support creating laws
[01:10.28]for how companies can collect, use and share personal data.
[01:18.04]Jennifer Benz is the head of the AP-NORC Center.
[01:24.52]"What is surprising to me is that there is a great deal of support

[01:36.20]But after years of failed efforts to create stronger data privacy laws,
[01:42.00]Americans do not trust the government to fix the problem.
[01:47.68]A majority of those who took part in the poll
[01:51.24]said they have more trust in private companies
[01:55.40]than the federal government to address security and privacy issues.
