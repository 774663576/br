。
[00:00.04]Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party have won a big victory in general elections.
[00:12.24]Results show the Conservatives won a clear majority of the 650 seats in Parliament.
[00:22.36]Johnson is now likely to act on his promise to lead Britain out of the European Union (EU).
[00:31.84]The country is set to withdraw from the EU by January 31, the latest time limit set by the two sides.
[00:43.64]However, British negotiators will have much work to do to reach a trade deal with Europe before that date.
[00:54.84]Johnson has stated that Britain will withdraw from the EU, a move known as Brexit, with or without a deal in place.
[01:07.48]It has been more than three years since Britons decided in a special referendum to separate from the EU.
[01:17.24]Political observers say it is likely that voters on Thursday,
[01:22.88]even those who wanted to stay with the EU, had grown tired of the issue and political indecision.
[01:33.00]Before the vote, Johnson had a simple message: "Get Brexit Done."
[01:39.92]The message was designed to win votes.
[01:43.40]During the election campaign, the prime minister tried to avoid answering reporters' questions.
[01:52.36]His actions led to criticism in the media, but clearly did not hurt him and other Conservative candidates.
[02:02.68]The Associated Press notes that the Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn,
[02:08.40]struggled to find a message to appeal to voters.
[02:14.20]Corbyn was seen as unsure about whether he supported Brexit or not.
[02:21.68]He was criticized for failing to take steps to deal with reports of anti-Semitism in his party.
[02:30.76]He also failed to gain support for costly socialist reforms.
[02:38.60]Corbyn has said he will not lead the Labour Party into another election, but has not offered to step down immediately.
[02:49.36]In addition to the Conservatives, the National Party of Scotland was another big winner in the elections.
[02:58.88]The party won 48 seats in Parliament, 13 more than it had before.
[03:06.60]Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, said the election gave her a renewed mandate
[03:14.64]to push for another vote on Scottish independence.
[03:20.08]A vote on independence failed in 2014.
[03:25.36]Johnson has said he opposes another referendum on Scotland.
[03:31.92]In Northern Ireland, the pro-Britain Democratic Unionist Party lost two of its 10 seats in the election.
[03:42.56]The party's leader, Arlene Foster, blamed Irish nationalist parties for the defeat.
[03:50.88]The vote showed strong support for Brexit, but the Brexit Party of Nigel Farage did not win any seats.
[04:00.88]The party decided against nominating candidates for 317 Conservative-held seats to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.
[04:14.04]Farage said he would rather his party not win seats than have a second referendum on Brexit.
[04:23.52]Johnson's success did not seem possible only a few weeks ago.
[04:29.96]His first three months in office were marked by defeats in Parliament and in the courts.
[04:38.36]This summer, after the prime minister sought to have Parliament suspended
[04:43.92]in order to push through Brexit, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled the move illegal.
[04:53.72]He was then forced to ask the EU for more time beyond October 31 to work toward a Brexit agreement.
[05:04.72]Johnson then took a chance by supporting calls for general elections
[05:10.64]in an effort to gain public support and allies to pass Brexit legislation.
