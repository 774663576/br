。
[00:00.72]World oil prices have risen a little
[00:04.12]after two years of weaker demand for oil and lower prices.
[00:10.36]During that time, a number of developments
[00:14.36]have affected the balance between oil supplies and demand.
[00:20.56]One is unrest in some oil-producing countries.
[00:26.88]Another is the expanded use of technology
[00:30.80]for collecting oil from deep underground.
[00:35.64]In addition, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
[00:41.96]has been working on a deal to reduce oil production.
[00:47.68]OPEC's members have been trying to limit production to ease oversupply.
[00:56.12]Perhaps the easiest way for Americans
[00:59.24]to experience the effects of oil prices is through gasoline.
[01:05.00]American drivers have paid less for fuel
[01:09.52]as oil supplies have increased and prices have dropped.
[01:15.44]In the United States, oil production has increased sharply in recent years.
[01:24.00]One reason is new technology,
[01:26.92]such as hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking.
[01:32.44]It has helped drilling services recover more oil and natural gas from the Earth.
[01:39.80]In fracking, liquid is forced into the ground under high pressure.
[01:47.28]The force can break up rock under the Earth's surface,
[01:51.40]releasing oil and gas.
[01:54.88]Hannah Breul is with the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
[02:00.40]She thinks oil prices will rise
[02:04.24]as supplies, or inventories of unsold oil, start to decrease.
[02:10.96]"Global supply has far exceeded global consumption,
[02:15.60]so we have seen massive inventory builds
[02:17.88]and we have seen lower prices as a result.
[02:19.92]Once the supply and consumption come back into alignment,
[02:22.80]and the inventories level off, and can start to be drawn down,
[02:26.92]that will be a market signal to increase production."
[02:30.60]Low oil prices hurt companies that use fracking,
[02:34.84]making their operations too costly and less profitable.
[02:40.36]Rising prices, says Breul, make it more cost-effective
[02:46.32]for oil producers to keep shale wells operating.
[02:51.20]She says demand for oil is expected to rise over a long period of time.
[02:59.92]Other things can influence oil prices.
[03:04.16]Members of OPEC and some major non-OPEC producers, like Russia,
[03:10.76]appear to have agreed on a deal to limit production.
[03:15.52]Russia's Energy Minister, Alexander Novak,
[03:20.20]says the two sides are trying to make joint agreements.
[03:25.76]Reports of a deal helped push oil prices above $50 a barrel temporarily.
[03:34.48]Prices had fallen to less than $40 last year.
[03:41.16]As a cartel, OPEC's members seek to fix prices so they can increase profits.
[03:49.36]One way they do this is with limits on oil production.
[03:55.04]The group is expected to meet in late November
[03:59.44]to finalize details of a production agreement.
[04:05.32]Several members, including Iraq,
[04:08.60]have asked for permission to be exempt from cuts.
[04:13.20]About two-thirds of electricity in the United States
[04:18.48]comes from coal and natural gas.
[04:22.48]The U.S Energy Information Administration says
[04:26.84]oil has little direct effect on the cost of energy.
[04:31.52]It says that only one percent of the country's electricity comes from oil.
[04:39.56]The cost of producing renewable energy has continued to fall.
[04:45.92]The International Energy Agency says
[04:49.68]renewable has become the world's largest new source of energy.
[04:56.12]The cost of producing energy from sources
[04:59.28]like the sun and wind is also decreasing.
[05:06.00]I'm Mario Ritter.
