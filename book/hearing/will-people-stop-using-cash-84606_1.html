。
[00:00.04]For centuries, people have kept large amounts of cash at home during difficult times.
[00:09.24]But in the coronavirus crisis, things are different.
[00:14.48]These metal coins and paper bills can be a source of worry rather than hope.
[00:22.04]The fear is that these objects, possibly touched by thousands of people,
[00:28.80]could be a way for the coronavirus to spread.
[00:33.32]Public officials and health experts have said that the risk is small.
[00:40.00]Still, some businesses refuse to accept them, and some countries have suggested
[00:47.76]that their citizens should stop using them altogether.
[00:53.08]Zachary Cohle is an economics professor at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.
[01:00.60]"In many areas, cash was already beginning to disappear
[01:05.76]due the increased risk of robbery, the ease of internet ordering,
[01:12.20]and the ubiquity of cell phones," he said.
[01:16.64]The term ubiquity refers to something being seen everywhere.
[01:22.48]Sweden, Finland, Norway, Canada and others have slowly reduced cash use
[01:30.64]to the point where using it in large amounts seems unusual.
[01:36.76]Britain and Australia are expected to become cashless countries.
[01:42.72]And in China, cash use has dropped as electronic payment services
[01:48.92]increased in popularity over the past ten years.
[01:54.24]"Cash ist Fesch" is a common saying in Austria and southern Germany.
[02:00.92]The words mean cash is beautiful.
