<p>The charging document reads that from 2005 through this year, the Trump Organization and its finance chief Allen Weisselberg cheated the state and city of taxes. It accuses them of hiding payments to top-level employees, including almost $1.7 million to Weisselberg himself. The company and chief financial officer were also charged with falsifying business records and other crimes.
这份指控文件显示，从2005年至今，川普集团及其财务主管艾伦·维塞尔伯格诈取了州市税款。文件指控他们隐瞒了支付给高级员工的款项，其中包括支付给维塞尔伯格本人的近170万美元。该公司和这位首席财务官还被指控伪造商业记录和其它罪行。</p>
