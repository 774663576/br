<p>It can be a word, action, or thing believed to have magic power, to keep away evil, or to bring good luck.</p>
<p>It can be a small item worn on a chain or bracelet. Charm bracelets are popular because you can add charms that show things you like, your hobbies, or your interests.</p>
<p>"Charm" is also a quality that attracts and pleases people. If you are charming, you charm people or you make them like you. In the story of Cinderella, the prince is called... Prince Charming.</p>
<p><strong>Works like a charm</strong></p>
<p>Now, let's talk about our first expression. If something <u>works like a charm</u> it works perfectly. Something that works like a charm does exactly want it is supposed to do. This expression can describe an approach, a method, a <strong>tactic</strong>, or even a device. Whatever it is works so well, that it seems like magic!</p>
<p>Let's hear two friends use it. One friend invites another to go boating for the weekend. But before that can happen, the invitee must find a dog watcher for the weekend. Let's hear how they use the expression <u>to work like a charm</u>.</p>
<p><em>A: So, can you go boating with me this weekend?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Yes! My roommate agreed to watch my dog Milo. </em></p>
<p><em>A: She did? I thought she didn't like Milo... at all. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Me too. She <strong>complains</strong> about my dog all the time. Milo is too big. Milo is too playful. Milo is too... whatever! </em></p>
<p><em>A: So, why did she agree to watch him?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Well, I told her that when I take Milo to the dog park lots of men want to play with such a big, friendly dog. And I added that some of these men are very good-looking. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Oh, that is too funny!</em></p>
<p><em>B: It might be funny, but it <u>worked like a charm</u>.</em></p>
<p><strong>The third time is the charm</strong></p>
<p>Now, for our next expression. Let's say a person tries to do something but fails at it two times, or twice. But they want to try again for a third time. They hope that on the third attempt, it will work.</p>
<p>In this situation, we can say the <u>third time is the charm.</u> However, when we use this expression we usually say it quickly – like this "third time's the charm."</p>
<p>We often use this expression to <strong>encourage </strong>someone to do something that they have tried a couple of times. Sometimes we use it to describe our own efforts. We try to convince ourselves that our efforts, whatever they are, will finally work out.</p>
<p>Here is another conversation using the expression <u>third time's the charm.</u></p>
<p><em>A: Where are you going with all those boxes?</em></p>
<p><em>B: I'm helping James open his new business. </em></p>
<p><em>A: James is opening another business? Didn't his past two businesses fail?</em></p>
<p><em>B: They did. He lost a lot of money on both of them. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Wow, he is brave for starting another business. You'd think he would have learned his lesson.</em></p>
<p><em>B: He said the <u>third time's the charm!</u> He really believes this one will work out. </em></p>
<p><em>A: What is the business anyway?</em></p>
<p><em>B: He is opening a dog summer camp. </em></p>
<p><em>A: A summer camp ... for dogs?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Yep. Those boxes are filled with dog treats and toys. </em></p>
<p><em>A: But people love spending time with their dogs in the summer. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Look, I'm just helping him out. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, in this case, I don't think <u>third time's the charm</u> is the best expression to use. I'd use ... don't quit your day job. </em></p>
<p>The expression may have its <strong>roots </strong>in old <strong>superstitions</strong>. It means that the third time will be lucky and therefore successful. Word experts say that some cultures throughout history viewed three as a lucky number.</p>

。
[00:07.48]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:10.84]from VOA Learning English.
[00:14.16]On today's program we talk about the word "charm."
[00:25.60]"Charm" has several meanings.
[00:28.92]It can be a word, action,
[00:31.88]or thing believed to have magic power,
[00:35.48]to keep away evil, or to bring good luck.
[00:41.24]It can be a small item worn on a chain or bracelet.
[00:46.92]Charm bracelets are popular because you can add charms
[00:51.56]that show things you like, your hobbies, or your interests.
[00:57.72]"Charm" is also a quality that attracts and pleases people.
[01:04.16]If you are charming,
[01:05.80]you charm people or you make them like you.
[01:11.08]In the story of Cinderella,
[01:13.00]the prince is called... Prince Charming.
[01:17.40]Now, let's talk about our first expression.
[01:20.76]If something works like a charm it works perfectly.
[01:27.56]Something that works like a charm
[01:29.60]does exactly want it is supposed to do.
[01:33.56]This expression can describe an approach,
[01:36.96]a method, a tactic, or even a device.
[01:41.32]Whatever it is works so well, that it seems like magic!
[01:48.24]Let's hear two friends use it.
[01:50.84]One friend invites another to go boating for the weekend.
[01:55.20]But before that can happen,
[01:57.72]the invitee must find a dog watcher for the weekend.
[02:02.68]Let's hear how they use the expression to work like a charm.
[02:08.24]A: So, can you go boating with me this weekend?
[02:12.32]B: Yes! My roommate agreed to watch my dog Milo.
[02:18.76]A: She did? I thought she didn't like Milo... at all.
[02:24.16]B: Me too. She complains about my dog all the time.
[02:29.24]Milo is too big. Milo is too playful.
[02:34.28]Milo is too... whatever!
[02:37.28]A: So, why did she agree to watch him?
[02:41.76]B: Well, I told her that when I take Milo to the dog park
[02:46.96]lots of men want to play with such a big, friendly dog.
[02:52.08]And I added that some of these men are very good-looking.
[02:57.76]A: Oh, that is too funny!
[03:00.56]B: It might be funny, but it worked like a charm.
[03:05.96]Now, for our next expression.
[03:08.48]Let's say a person tries to do something
[03:11.76]but fails at it two times, or twice.
[03:16.52]But they want to try again for a third time.
[03:20.56]They hope that on the third attempt, it will work.
[03:25.44]In this situation, we can say the third time is the charm.
[03:31.12]However, when we use this expression
[03:34.00]we usually say it quickly – like this "third time's the charm."
[03:40.32]We often use this expression
[03:42.32]to encourage someone to do something
[03:45.20]that they have tried a couple of times.
[03:48.60]Sometimes we use it to describe our own efforts.
[03:52.48]We try to convince ourselves that our efforts,
[03:55.24]whatever they are, will finally work out.
[04:01.24]Here is another conversation
[04:03.44]using the expression third time's the charm.
[04:08.32]A: Where are you going with all those boxes?
[04:11.28]B: I'm helping James open his new business.
[04:15.44]A: James is opening another business?
[04:17.96]Didn't his past two businesses fail?
[04:20.96]B: They did. He lost a lot of money on both of them.
[04:25.40]A: Wow, he is brave for starting another business.
[04:29.16]You'd think he would have learned his lesson.
[04:32.20]B: He said the third time's the charm!
[04:35.48]He really believes this one will work out.
[04:39.84]A: What is the business anyway?
[04:42.20]B: He is opening a dog summer camp.
[04:46.76]A: A summer camp ... for dogs?
[04:49.76]B: Yep. Those boxes are filled with dog treats and toys.
[04:55.24]A: But people love spending time with their dogs in the summer.
[04:58.92]B: Look, I'm just helping him out.
[05:01.72]A: Well, in this case, I don't think third time's the charm
[05:06.44]is the best expression to use.
[05:10.32]I'd use ... don't quit your day job.
[05:13.92]The expression may have its roots in old superstitions.
[05:18.96]It means that the third time will be lucky
[05:22.48]and therefore successful.
[05:26.00]Word experts say that some cultures throughout history
[05:29.84]viewed three as a lucky number.
[05:34.44]And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories.
[05:37.88]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.
