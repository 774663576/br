[00:00.04]Gardening requires a lot of physical labor.
[00:06.20]The activity can extend
[00:08.80]from light exercise to heavy labor.
[00:14.48]All that bending, lifting, digging, carrying
[00:20.08]and moving burns calories and builds muscle.
[00:26.64]But it can also injure the body.
[00:30.28]A gardener's back can start to hurt
[00:34.08]and so can their knees.
[00:37.76]Even the strongest and healthiest
[00:40.80]of gardeners can hurt themselves.
[00:44.40]For people who are less physically fit
[00:48.12]or who have health conditions
[00:51.04]that limit movement or cause pain,
[00:54.24]gardening may seem impossible.
[00:57.52]But there are ways to grow plants
[01:01.44]that are gentle on the body
[01:04.00]says expert Jessica Damiano.
[01:07.28]She recently provided
[01:10.24]some advice on the subject
[01:12.60]in a report for the Associated Press.
[01:16.32]Damiano said she uses
[01:19.60]heating pads on her neck and lower back
[01:23.32]for about five minutes
[01:26.20]before starting to garden.
[01:29.80]This helps to prepare her muscles for work.
[01:35.00]A few minutes of gentle stretching helps, too.
[01:40.32]Try to collect all the tools you will need
[01:44.24]before settling in to your labor.
[01:48.36]It is also a good idea
[01:51.00]to store the heaviest equipment
[01:54.00]on waist-height shelves
[01:56.56]for the easiest and safest removal and return.
[02:02.68]Taking simple care in the way you lift
[02:06.36]and carry the objects you need
[02:09.48]can prevent injury.
[02:12.52]Remember to bend at the knees
[02:15.72]when lifting bags of mulch.
[02:18.76]You can stand with your feet
[02:21.68]as far apart as your shoulders
[02:24.88]to keep your balance.
[02:27.92]If bending at all is too difficult,
[02:31.16]or if you garden while seated,
[02:34.68]grow plants in raised beds
[02:38.00]that are as tall as your chair
[02:40.52]or the middle part of your body.
[02:44.44]You also can grow plants in towers or on trellises.
[02:50.12]Use wheelbarrows to transport heavy supplies.
[02:55.40]It is easy to overestimate
[02:59.76]your ability to carry heavy loads.
[03:03.64]The result can lead to injury.
[03:07.88]When you carry weight on your own,
[03:10.92]hold heavy objects to your chest,
[03:14.52]keeping your back as straight as possible.
[03:19.08]Plant containers can be very heavy.
[03:22.00]It is best to set containers
[03:25.20]where you want them before you fill them.
[03:29.92]Damiano's flower garden
[03:31.96]contains mostly perennials.
[03:35.04]She likes them better than annuals,
[03:38.60]which need replanting every year.
[03:41.64]That lessens her work –

[03:48.36]Plus, perennials, which return
[03:51.96]year after year,
[03:54.04]usually cost more at first but,
[03:57.84]over time, save money
[04:00.64]because you are not buying

[04:06.60]Move around on a garden seat with wheels.
[04:11.00]You also can use pads to protect your knees.

[04:26.56]You can also update your existing tools
[04:30.76]with grips and wraps made to fit them.
[04:35.64]Most importantly, take it slow and easy.
[04:40.32]Limit gardening periods
