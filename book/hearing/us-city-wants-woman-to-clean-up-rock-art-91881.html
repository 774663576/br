。
[00:00.04]Iris Logan was having a hard time
[00:03.44]growing grass at her home in St. Paul, Minnesota.
[00:08.96]So, she covered the space with stones,
[00:12.04]statues, and other art.
[00:15.72]More than 30 years later,
[00:18.12]it is something of a local landmark.
[00:22.32]But to a city inspector, it is a problem.
[00:27.24]Logan, who is 70, has been told
[00:30.72]to clean up the different objects,
[00:33.16]like wood and large rocks,
[00:35.96]noted after a recent inspection,
[00:39.52]the St. Paul Pioneer Press,
[00:42.16]a local newspaper reported.
[00:45.80]The City Council will look at the issue on December 6.
[00:51.72]Logan said the city's actions
[00:54.60]forced her to create the art in the first place.
[00:59.28]She said city workers who were fixing the road
[01:02.96]dug so deep around one of her trees
[01:06.72]that its roots were open to the air.
[01:10.76]So, she brought in dirt, planted flowers,
[01:14.36]and added stones – and just kept adding.
[01:19.00]Logan said that if she likes a rock,
[01:22.00]she will try to bring it home.
[01:25.32]"I'm a rock lover,"
[01:27.04]the former farmer from Mississippi added.
[01:31.48]Logan recently received written notice
[01:34.84]that a city official will suggest to the City Council
[01:39.20]that she be given until December 22 to clean things up.
[01:46.24]She wrote six pages of note
[01:48.48]by hand to appeal the order.
[01:52.12]The stones do not enter the street
[01:54.76]or block city vehicles, Logan wrote to answer
[01:59.20]one of the inspector's concerns.
[02:03.04]"I just want to make a stand
[02:05.04]for the next person," Logan said.
[02:08.92]Casey Rodriguez is a spokeswoman
[02:11.88]for the St. Paul Department of Safety and Inspections.
[02:17.44]She said about 16 other properties on the same street
[02:21.76]also received letters advising them to remove objects
[02:26.80]blocking the street to agree with city laws.
[02:31.68]She said in an email to the Pioneer Press
[02:35.36]that large roads, called boulevards,
[02:38.68]should be clear of objects that can block access
[02:42.36]to power and water lines.
[02:46.00]She added that it also keeps the tree roots clear
[02:50.20]and provides a place for snow in the winter.
[02:54.96]Justin Lewandowski is a community organizer
[02:59.32]who lives near Logan.
[03:02.28]He said that 150 people
[03:05.36]signed their support on a petition
[03:08.48]"in just a few hours."
[03:11.92]He is hopeful that the city
[03:13.84]will soon clear up their rules.
[03:17.56]"The quick support from our neighbors
[03:19.92]has been a clear signal of how much this art
[03:23.52]means to our community," Lewandowski said.
[03:28.68]He said it is not just about how it looks;
[03:31.84]it is about their identity
[03:34.24]and how they work with each other
[03:36.68]and with city policy.
[03:39.84]I'm Gregory Stachel.
