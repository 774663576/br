。
[00:00.04]Jenya Polosina and Anna Ivanenko are Ukrainian artists.
[00:07.80]After Russia invaded their country,
[00:10.80]they decided to use their skills to push back against the war.
[00:17.24]Polosina and Ivanenko worked with other artists
[00:22.08]in the early days of the war,
[00:24.32]which began in February of 2022.
[00:29.60]The group worked together in bomb shelters in Kyiv.
[00:34.72]Sometimes the artists worked without electricity and water.
[00:40.80]Some of their art is on display
[00:44.00]in the northeastern U.S. state of New Hampshire.
[00:49.44]The show is called "Our Fire Is Stronger Than Your Bombs."
[00:55.44]The show opened last week
[00:57.76]at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester.
[01:03.60]Polosina, Ivanenko and six other Ukrainian artists
[01:09.52]provided 20 pieces of art to the show.
[01:14.40]Artwork from Ivanenko show children studying in a bomb shelter
[01:20.60]and Ukrainians fleeing the country soon after the war started.
[01:27.12]Artwork from Polosina honors a Ukrainian female gymnast
[01:32.84]and a young mathematician.
[01:36.16]Both were among those
[01:38.00]who have been killed by Russian missile strikes.
[01:42.60]Before the war,
[01:44.00]Polosina produced artwork for books and advertising
[01:49.16]that dealt with human rights issues.
[01:53.24]She created artwork for Ukraine's
[01:55.96]largest LGBTQ rights event, KyivPride.
[02:01.84]Ivanenko also did book and advertising projects.
[02:07.36]But the two quickly changed their work to center on the war.
[02:12.80]They shared their creations on social media.
[02:17.40]The artwork has become part of a growing online effort
[02:22.20]to draw attention around the world to Russia's war with Ukraine.
[02:28.56]Ivanenko described how she was "charged with rage"
[02:33.16]and a "desire to stop the war, stop the aggressions."
[02:37.92]So her artwork is her effort to help "in a small way."
[02:43.56]Polosina said being able to show the Ukrainian artists' work
[02:48.84]in New Hampshire "is very important for us because
[02:53.80]this is almost direct communication with viewers outside of Ukraine
[03:00.44]that can see our reflections,
[03:02.96]that can see our feelings and be more sympathetic."
