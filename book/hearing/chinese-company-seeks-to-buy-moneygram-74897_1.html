<div class="content">The Chinese company Ant Financial is intensifying efforts to buy the American company MoneyGram International.中国蚂蚁金服公司正在加紧收购美国的速汇金国际（MoneyGram International）公司。 
<p>MoneyGram is the world's second-largest money transfer company. Western Union is the largest.速汇金是全球第二大汇款公司，西联是行业老大。</p>
<p>Ant Financial has been linked in media reports to the Chinese company Alibaba. Ant Financial has offered to pay $1.2 billion more for the company than Euronet Worldwide, a company making a competing offer. Euronet is based in the United States.<br/>媒体报道称蚂蚁金服同中国阿里巴巴公司存在关联。蚂蚁金服对速汇金出资12亿美元，超过了竞购对手嘉银通(Euronet Worldwide)的报价。嘉银通总部设在美国。</p>
<p>MoneyGram has a network of 350,000 places where people can send and receive money. These include stores, post offices and banks in 200 countries.<br/>速汇金有35万个网点可供人们收发资金，其中包括分布在200个国家的零售店、邮局和银行。</p>
<p>Ant Financial's business is now mostly in the Chinese currency, the yuan. If it is able to buy MoneyGram, Ant Financial would be able to use American dollars and control accounts that are used to hold and manage the company's money.<br/>蚂蚁金服目前的主要业务为人民币。如果能够收购速汇金，蚂蚁金服将能够使用美元并控制那些用于持有和管理该公司资金的账户。</p>
<p>After Euronet offered to buy MoneyGram in March, Ant Financial increased its offer by 36 percent. This decision confirmed that it was determined to buy MoneyGram and begin competing with Western Union.<br/>在嘉银通3月份提出收购速汇金之后，蚂蚁金服将其报价提高了36%。这个决定证实了该公司决意收购速汇金并同西联展开竞争。</p>
<p>However, Euronet has not stopped efforts to buy MoneyGram. It is warning that if Ant Financial is able to buy the company it will have a huge amount of information about the company's customers. Euronet says this is a security risk.<br/>然而，嘉银通并未停止收购速汇金的努力。该公司警告说，如果蚂蚁金服得以收购速汇金，那么它将能获得大量该公司客户的信息。嘉银通称这是一个安全隐患。</p>
<p>If Ant Financial's offer is accepted, the deal must still gain the approval of the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS. Some experts believe this would be the first test for a Chinese financial company seeking to do business in the U.S.<br/>如果蚂蚁金服的报价被接受，该交易仍然必须得到美国外国投资委员会(CFIUS)的批准。有专家认为，这将是寻求在美国开展业务的中国金融公司面临的首项考验。</p>
<p>Jeffrey Towson is a professor of investments at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management.<br/>杰弗里·托森(Jeffrey Towson)是北京大学光华管理学院的投资学教授。</p>
<p>He told VOA that "getting approval from CFIUS might be more difficult this year. Plus, Chinese acquisitions are more on the media radar than before. And finally, there is also a competing bidder, Euronet, and they will probably push for a regulatory denial based on security concerns."<br/>他对美国之音表示，“今年要获得美国外国投资委员会的批准可能会更加困难。另外，中国的收购比以往更受媒体关注。最后，还有嘉银通这个竞争对手，他们可能会推动监管机构基于安全考虑予以否决。”</p>
<p><strong>Concerns raised on acquisition of MoneyGram<br/>收购速汇金引发关注</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Yoder of Kansas and Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas are members of the U.S. House of Representatives. They have written to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the possible purchase of MoneyGram by Ant Financial.<br/>堪萨斯州的凯文·尤德（Kevin Yoder）和德克萨斯州的埃迪·伯尼斯·约翰逊(Eddie Bernice Johnson)是美国众议院的议员。他们都为蚂蚁金服可能收购速汇金致信财政部长史蒂文·努钦(steven mnuchin)。</p>
<p>They wrote, "The proposal merits careful evaluation as it would provide Chinese access to the U.S. financial infrastructure, a move that would pose significant national security risks if completed."<br/>他们写道，“该动议值得认真评估，因为这将为中国人进入美国金融基础设施提供入口。如果此举完成，将会带来重大的国家安全风险。”</p>
<p>Ant Financial has said that MoneyGram information will be stored in secure computer servers in the United States. And in a letter to people who own shares in the company, Douglas Feagin said MoneyGram will "continue to be headquartered in Dallas and run by its current U.S.-based management team after the deal closes."<br/>蚂蚁金服表示，速汇金的信息将存储在美国安全的计算机服务器之中。道格拉斯·费金（Douglas Feagin）在致信该公司股东的信件中表示，在交易完成之后，速汇金的总部将继续设在达拉斯市，并且由该公司目前的美国管理团队来运营。</p>
<p>He promised that Ant will "continue to invest in MoneyGram's systems and compliance programs."<br/>他承诺蚂蚁金服将继续投资于速汇金的系统和合规计划。</p>

He says although CFIUS has denied "quite a few recent attempted Chinese takeovers, there isn't an obvious national security case here as to why they should stop the transaction."<br/>彼得·富尔曼（Peter Fuhrman）是中国首创投资公司的董事长。他说，虽然美国外国投资委员会“否决了中国近期不少的收购企图，但是这不是一项他们应该阻止交易的明显的国家安全案例。”</p>

[01:31.24]After Euronet offered to buy MoneyGram in March,
[01:35.92]Ant Financial increased its offer by 36 percent.
[01:42.24]This decision confirmed that it was determined to buy MoneyGram
[01:47.84]and begin competing with Western Union.
[01:52.60]However, Euronet has not stopped efforts to buy MoneyGram.
[01:59.64]It is warning that if Ant Financial is able to buy the company
[02:05.40]it will have a huge amount of information about the company's customers.
[02:12.32]Euronet says this is a security risk.
[02:17.68]If Ant Financial's offer is accepted, the deal must still gain the approval
[02:24.44]of the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS.
[02:32.76]Some experts believe this would be the first test for a Chinese financial company
[02:39.76]seeking to do business in the U.S.
[02:44.08]Jeffrey Towson is a professor of investments

[04:08.88]Ant Financial has said that MoneyGram information
[04:13.12]will be stored in secure computer servers in the United States.
[04:19.12]And in a letter to people who own shares in the company,
[04:24.16]Douglas Feagin said MoneyGram will "continue to be headquartered in Dallas
[04:31.16]and run by its current U.S.-based management team after the deal closes."
[04:39.47]He promised that Ant will "continue to invest in MoneyGram's systems and compliance programs."
