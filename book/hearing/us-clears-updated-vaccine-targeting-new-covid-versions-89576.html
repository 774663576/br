[00:00.04]The United States on Wednesday
[00:03.40]approved an updated COVID-19 vaccine
[00:07.80]to target the Omicron version of the virus.
[00:12.08]Injections could be available within days.
[00:17.16]The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA,
[00:21.48]approved the new shots
[00:23.80]made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
[00:27.64]Officials credit the two vaccines
[00:31.68]with saving millions of lives.
[00:34.76]And the agency says it hopes that the new shot
[00:39.44]will prevent another increase in infections this winter.
[00:45.76]"You'll see me at the front of the line,"
[00:48.28]FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks told The Associated Press
[00:55.16]shortly before his agency approved the new vaccines.
[01:01.56]Until now, COVID-19 vaccines
[01:05.36]had targeted the earliest version of the coronavirus.
[01:09.92]Since then, several versions, or variants, have appeared.
[01:16.04]The new shots are called "bivalent."
[01:20.44]They are designed to protect against both the earliest
[01:25.44]and newer versions of Omicron called BA.4 and BA.5.
[01:34.16]These two are considered the most contagious.
[01:39.12]"It really provides the broadest opportunity for protection,"
[01:44.96]Pfizer vaccine chief Annaliesa Anderson told the AP.
[01:51.68]The updated shots, called boosters, are for people
[01:56.84]who have already received the earlier vaccine.
[02:00.68]The FDA said the shots are not to be used as a first vaccination.
[02:08.28]And they should be given at least two months
[02:12.08]after people receive the last shot of the earlier vaccine version.
[02:19.28]The updated shots from Pfizer-BioNTech
[02:22.92]may be given to anyone 12 years old and older.
[02:29.00]The ones from Moderna are for adults.
[02:34.12]The U.S. has purchased more than 170 million treatments
[02:39.96]from the two companies.
[02:42.68]Pfizer said it could ship up to 15 million of the vaccines
[02:48.72]by the end of next week.
[02:52.20]Before the vaccination campaign begins,
[02:55.76]the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[03:00.24]will meet Thursday.
[03:02.24]Agency leaders are to decide whether people at high risk
[03:07.76]from COVID-19 should receive the updated shots first.

[03:18.36]to receive a three-shot vaccination against COVID-19.
[03:25.20]So far, only half of vaccinated Americans
[03:29.52]have gotten the third shot.

[03:42.12]The earliest vaccines still offer strong protection
[03:46.92]against severe disease and death
[03:49.56]from COVID-19 for generally healthy people.
[03:55.28]It is unclear whether some Americans
[03:58.60]will take the updated shots at all.

[04:16.36]that getting the updated COVID-19 shot
[04:20.44]is just like getting the yearly flu shot.
