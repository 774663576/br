<p><em>A completely dark house and a huge pile of mail outside the door were two <u>dead giveaways</u> that no one had been home in quite some time.</em></p>
<p><em>She said that she was staying home for the night. But with all the <strong>makeup</strong> on her face, her hair <strong>styled</strong>, and her party clothes on, her appearance was a <u>dead giveaway</u>. She was clearly going out. </em></p>
<p><em>The expression on his face was a <u>dead giveaway</u> that he was guilty. He couldn't even look me in the eyes! </em></p>
<p>English has another expression that is similar. A <u>telltale sign</u> is an important detail or fact the clarifies the truth. It gives more supporting evidence.</p>
<p>We often pair telltale with the words “sign” or “<strong>symptom</strong>.”</p>
<p>Let's hear some examples:</p>
<p><em>Well, my friend has missed work all week and hasn't responded to my calls. Those may be <u>telltale symptoms</u> of a bigger problem. </em></p>

[00:08.40]And now, Words and Their Stories
[00:11.80]from VOA Learning English.
[00:18.56]On this program we explore
[00:20.92]words and expressions
[00:22.44]in the English language.
[00:24.40]We give examples, notes on usage
[00:28.16]and sometimes use them
[00:30.64]in short conversations.
[00:33.76]Today we talk about an expression
[00:36.92]that sounds very serious
[00:39.60]and dangerous: a dead giveaway.
[00:45.20]A "giveaway" is just as it sounds:
[00:49.12]You give something to someone else.
[00:51.92]But a dead giveaway
[00:54.60]has nothing to do with tragedy or death.
[00:59.36]In this expression,
[01:01.04]the word "dead" has another meaning
[01:04.04]you might not have known about.
[01:07.32]In some common usages,
[01:09.60]the adjective "dead" can mean exact,
[01:12.92]correct or complete.
[01:16.72]For example, if someone is dead right,
[01:20.48]they are completely correct
[01:22.84]and there is no doubt about it.
[01:26.20]And, if someone is dead wrong,
[01:29.28]they are totally wrong.
[01:32.48]In some trades, the word "dead"
[01:35.36]is a really good thing.
[01:38.20]For example, when something is dead center,
[01:41.76]it is exactly at the center.
[01:44.80]In building, dead level
[01:47.56]means perfectly horizontal
[01:50.28]—just what you want.
[01:52.64]However, you never say "dead plumb."
[01:55.88]Plumb already means perfectly vertical.
[02:01.36]So, a dead giveaway is a detail or action
[02:05.92]that gives away the truth
[02:07.72]completely and totally.
[02:10.96]It is like a clue that answers a question.
[02:14.24]A dead giveaway shows a truth,
[02:17.88]fact, or intention in an obvious way.
[02:23.00]In other words, a dead giveaway
[02:25.56]leaves little room for misunderstanding.
[02:30.16]Now, let's hear the expression
[02:32.52]in some examples.
[02:35.24]A completely dark house
[02:37.04]and a huge pile of mail outside the door
[02:40.56]were two dead giveaways that no one
[02:43.60]had been home in quite some time.
[02:47.44]She said that she was staying home for the night.
[02:51.44]But with all the makeup on her face,
[02:54.44]her hair styled, and her party clothes on,
[02:58.08]her appearance was a dead giveaway.
[03:01.24]She was clearly going out.
[03:05.04]The expression on his face
[03:06.92]was a dead giveaway that he was guilty.
[03:09.68]He couldn't even look me in the eyes!
[03:13.40]English has another expression that is similar.
[03:17.16]A telltale sign
[03:19.72]is an important detail or fact
[03:22.68]the clarifies the truth.
[03:25.12]It gives more supporting evidence.
[03:29.60]We often pair telltale
[03:32.08]with the words "sign" or "symptom."
[03:35.96]Let's hear some examples:
[03:38.92]Well, my friend has missed work all week
[03:42.12]and hasn't responded to my calls.
[03:45.64]Those may be telltale symptoms
[03:48.04]of a bigger problem.
[03:50.96]When the parents returned from their trip,
[03:53.32]they saw telltale signs everywhere in the house
[03:56.16]that their children had thrown a party.
[04:00.28]And that's all the time we have 
[04:03.32]for this Words and Their Stories.
[04:05.72]Until next time,
[04:07.24]I'm Anna Matteo.
