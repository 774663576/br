<p><strong>What is Alzheimer's?</strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that 50 million people around the world have <strong>dementia</strong>. Alzheimer's disease might be the cause of 60 to 70 percent of dementia cases.

<p>Another drugmaker, Eli Lilly, said it is also developing a possible treatment, donanemab, that targets the protein.</p>
<p>The race to slow the progression of Alzheimer's comes as the number of Americans living with the disease is expected to double to 13 million by 2050, the Alzheimer's Association said.</p>
<p>Around the world, Alzheimer's Disease International said the number of disease cases could reach well over 100 million people by 2050 if no effective treatment is found.</p>

[00:00.04]Drugmakers Biogen and Eisai
[00:03.16]say their experimental drug lecanemab
[00:06.92]slowed the progress of Alzheimer's disease
[00:10.72]in a large human study the companies did.
[00:15.52]The results could mean a rare victory
[00:18.88]in a field filled with failed experiments
[00:22.60]to find an effective treatment for the disease.
[00:27.24]The companies said early results showed that the treatment
[00:31.64]reduced cognitive loss by 27 percent
[00:36.20]when compared to a placebo, an inactive substance.
[00:41.36]The 18-month-long study involved 1,800 subjects.
[00:48.12]All had been identified with early-stage Alzheimer's.
[00:53.52]The patients were measured for mental decline
[00:56.88]and their ability to do daily activities
[01:01.04]like putting on clothes and feeding themselves.
[01:05.64]Dr. Jeff Cummings is the director of the Chambers-Grundy Center
[01:11.56]for Transformative Neuroscience
[01:14.40]at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.
[01:18.72]The expert told Reuters, "If you can slow a disease
[01:22.76]by almost 30 percent, that's fantastic."
[01:28.00]Expert Ronald Petersen also praised the findings.

[02:50.44]There is no known cure for the disease.
[02:54.48]And long-standing treatments on the market
