[00:00.04]Researchers are renewing efforts
[00:03.36]to find Alzheimer's disease treatments
[00:06.88]that remove harmful proteins from the brain.
[00:11.64]Such vaccines could possibly offer
[00:15.20]an easier and lower-cost choice
[00:18.76]for millions of people,
[00:21.28]several scientists and industry leaders say.
[00:26.52]The brain-wasting disease
[00:28.76]causes thinking and memory problems.
[00:33.12]The U.S. government website ClinicalTrials.gov
[00:37.88]shows that at least seven possible Alzheimer's vaccines
[00:42.88]are in human testing or have completed such trials.
[00:49.12]The experimental treatments
[00:51.68]are designed to use the body's natural defense system
[00:56.40]to destroy Alzheimer's-linked proteins in the brain.
[01:02.36]The proteins are beta amyloid and tau.
[01:07.16]The renewed interest in Alzheimer's vaccines
[01:10.80]follows a promising first attempt
[01:13.88]more than 20 years ago.
[01:17.56]That vaccine work halted after six percent of study volunteers
[01:23.96]developed a life-threatening brain condition
[01:27.40]called meningoencephalitis.
[01:31.76]Researchers then found a safer method
[01:35.36]using closely targeted synthetic antibodies in patients.
[01:41.64]These antibodies avoid extreme immune system reaction.
[01:47.92]Health care companies Eisai and Biogen
[01:51.84]launched a new medication called Leqembi
[01:55.64]and health care company Eli Lilly launched Donanemab.
[02:02.24]American government drug experts
[02:05.08]are reviewing the treatments.
[02:08.44]The reported success of the drugs
[02:10.96]has strengthened the theories that amyloid
[02:14.36]removal is critical to fighting Alzheimer's.
[02:19.00]Scientists believe they now understand
[02:22.24]what went wrong with the first vaccine.
[02:26.32]They are testing shots they hope will cause an immune reaction
[02:31.12]without causing too much inflammation.
[02:35.36]Dr. Reisa Sperling is an Alzheimer's researcher
[02:39.52]at Mass General Brigham in Boston.
[02:44.44]She said she believes vaccines
[02:47.04]will play an important part
[02:49.68]as researchers look to prevent Alzheimer's.
[02:54.56]She said, "I'm very keen
[02:57.08]that that's where we need to go."
[03:00.56]Sperling is leading a trial
[03:02.80]in people with Alzheimer's proteins in their brains
[03:06.56]but showing no signs of related problems.
[03:11.52]She is considering vaccines for her next study
[03:15.04]in people who have Alzheimer's proteins in their blood,
[03:19.64]but not enough to show on imaging of the brain.
[03:24.56]Alzheimer's vaccines are still in the early stages
[03:29.12]and will require large,
[03:31.36]years-long trials to show they work.
[03:35.44]But a vaccine given two or four times a year
[03:39.44]could offer a lower-cost solution than Leqembi.
[03:45.56]Leqembi is given twice a month.
[03:48.68]That could expand available treatment
[03:52.20]among the estimated 39 million people
[03:56.00]around the world with Alzheimer's.
[04:00.00]Dr. Walter Koroshetz is director of the part of
[04:04.48]U.S. National Institutes of Health
[04:07.32]that deals with disorders involving the brain.
[04:11.72]He said of the vaccines,
