。
[00:00.04]American government experts
[00:03.48]who studied a popular medicine used for colds
[00:08.48]say the drug is likely not effective
[00:12.64]and should not be taken by mouth.
[00:17.48]Sixteen experts for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
[00:23.56]examined the drug phenylephrine.
[00:27.68]The drug is in many medicines that treat nasal congestion,
[00:33.40]a condition also known as a stuffy nose.
[00:39.00]The medicines include Sudafed,
[00:42.04]Allegra and Dayquil among others.
[00:47.20]The experts read a scientific review
[00:50.80]released by the FDA before they met.
[00:55.44]The scientific study said
[00:57.56]there were many mistakes in earlier tests
[01:01.16]of phenylephrine's effectiveness.
[01:04.60]It said the FDA no longer accepted the earlier testing results.
[01:12.08]One of the experts was Dr. Mark Dykewicz.
[01:16.68]He is an allergy specialist
[01:19.24]at Saint Louis University School of Medicine.
[01:24.24]Dykewicz said, "Modern studies, when well conducted,
[01:29.52]are not showing any improvement
[01:32.44]in congestion with phenylephrine."
[01:37.12]Phenylephrine is an over-the-counter drug.
[01:42.08]Anyone can buy it at a store.
[01:44.96]A doctor's order is not required to purchase it.
[01:50.32]Phenylephrine is the most popular decongestant
[01:54.44]in a market valued at $2.2 billion dollars.
[02:01.00]If the FDA follows the advice of the experts,
[02:06.00]companies that make the medicine
[02:08.56]will have to remove it from stores.
[02:12.56]These companies include Johnson &amp; Johnson, B
[02:16.76]ayer and other leading drug makers.
[02:21.80]The drug would remain in medicines
[02:24.36]taken through the nose, however.
[02:27.80]The nasal spray form of phenylephrine
[02:30.96]is considered effective and there are no plans to review it.
[02:37.76]But offering higher amounts of the drug by mouth is not possible
[02:43.24]because it can increase blood pressure to dangerous levels.
[02:49.60]Researchers at the University of Florida
[02:53.28]first requested that the FDA remove phenylephrine
[02:58.20]from a list of approved drugs.
[03:02.04]The same researchers questioned the drug's effectiveness in 2007.
[03:09.40]They said they found no difference between using the drug
[03:14.64]and using an inactive substance called a placebo.
[03:20.72]Phenylephrine has been sold in different forms for 75 years.
[03:27.92]Dr. Theresa Michele leads the FDA's office of nonprescription drugs.
[03:35.16]She said, "Any time a product has been on the market that long,
[03:41.84]it's human nature to make assumptions
[03:45.00]about what we know about the product."
[03:49.44]The FDA reviewers said the studies they examined
[03:54.36]showed how quickly the body processes phenylephrine.
[04:00.16]The research shows that too little of the drug
[04:04.56]reaches the area of the nose
[04:07.24]when the medicine is taken by mouth.
[04:11.36]Forms of the drug sprayed into the nose appear more effective.
[04:18.04]The reviewers said barring the drug from medicine taken by mouth
[04:23.24]would avoid the "unnecessary costs and delay in care
[04:29.12]of taking a drug that has no benefit.
[04:34.48]The FDA has not updated its list of
[04:38.32]approved drugs to treat nasal congestion since 1995.
[04:45.64]The process for changing the list takes years.
[04:50.80]But Congress passed a law in 2020
[04:54.80]that would speed the process for drugs
[04:58.08]that do not require a doctor's permission to use.
