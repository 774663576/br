<p>United States health officials are warning of an increase in rare bacterial illnesses that can lead to meningitis. It is a serious and often deadly disease in which an outside barrier of the brain or related tissues becomes infected and <strong>swollen</strong>.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00505.asp">issued a warning on March 28</a> about the increase in one kind of invasive "meningococcal disease" called serogroup Y.</p>
<p>Last year, 422 cases of it were reported in the U.S. — the most in a year since 2014. So far this year, 143 cases have been reported.

<p>The infection caused by meningococcal disease can lead to <strong>symptoms</strong> that may include high body temperature, head and upper body pain, <strong>nausea</strong>, and throwing up</p>

<p>Officials suggest that all children should get a "meningococcal conjugate vaccine" around the age of 11. Since vaccine protection weakens over time, the CDC also suggests a second shot at age 16.</p>

[00:01.88]United States health officials
[00:04.36]are warning of an increase
[00:06.36]in rare bacterial illnesses
[00:09.00]that can lead to meningitis.
[00:12.56]It is a serious and often deadly disease
[00:16.08]in which an outside barrier of the brain
[00:18.92]or related tissues becomes infected and swollen.
[00:24.40]The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
[00:28.76]issued a warning on March 28
[00:31.64]about the increase in one kind of invasive
[00:35.04]"meningococcal disease" called serogroup Y.
[00:39.88]Last year, 422 cases of it
[00:43.44]were reported in the U.S. —
[00:45.52]the most in a year since 2014.
[00:49.64]So far this year, 143 cases have been reported.
[00:55.36]That means infections are on their way
[00:57.64]to go above 2023 numbers, the CDC said.
[01:03.56]Most of the cases last year did not involve meningitis,
[01:07.96]though at least 17 died.
[01:11.44]The cases were more common in adults ages 30 to 60,
[01:15.60]in Black people and those who have HIV, the CDC said.
[01:21.84]HIV is a virus that can lead to AIDS,
[01:25.00]a serious disease that can destroy
[01:27.36]the body's natural defense system.
[01:30.60]The infection caused by meningococcal disease
[01:34.04]can lead to symptoms
[01:35.96]that may include high body temperature,
[01:38.76]head and upper body pain, nausea, and throwing up
[01:44.16]The bacteria can also cause an infection in the blood system.
[01:49.08]That infection could bring cold,
[01:51.52]tiredness, cold hands and feet, quick breathing, diarrhea,
[01:56.56]or discoloration of the skin.
[01:59.96]The infection can be treated with medications like antibiotics.
[02:04.92]But treatment must be quick to be successful.
[02:08.16]An estimated 10 to 15 percent of infected people die.
[02:13.36]And survivors sometimes lose the ability to hear
[02:17.72]or body parts must be surgically removed
[02:22.64]There also are vaccines against meningococcal disease.
[02:26.24]Officials suggest that all children
[02:29.80]should get a "meningococcal conjugate vaccine"
[02:32.68]around the age of 11.
[02:35.76]Since vaccine protection weakens over time,
[02:38.56]the CDC also suggests a second shot at age 16.
[02:44.12]The CDC also suggests the shots for people at higher risk.
[02:50.04]Higher-risk individuals might include
[02:52.44]those who live where an outbreak is taking place
[02:55.60]or those with HIV infection
[02:58.08]or other kinds of health conditions.
