<p>Vietnam also uses its surplus to buy a lot of foreign money, mostly U.S. dollars.

越南还利用其顺差购买了大量外汇，其中大部分是美元。美国财政部本月在一份报告中抱怨称，这会助长美元升值，并让越南货币贬值。在川普政府希望美国消费者少买越南产品这样一个时机，越南的出口似乎更便宜了。</p>

<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Vietnam Has One of the Highest Rates of Consumer Savings]

。
[00:00.04]The market research company Nielsen reports that Vietnam has one of the world's highest rates of consumer savings.
[00:09.76]But observers disagree on whether it is a good sign.
[00:15.72]Sixty-nine percent of Vietnamese surveyed said they put extra money into savings.
[00:23.16]That compares with 66 percent of people in China and 62 percent in Indonesia.
[00:32.72]As a developing nation, Vietnam is becoming increasingly wealthy.
[00:38.68]The country's citizens are saving more, just as many people in countries around the world.
[00:48.32]But observers, such as Binky Chadha of Deutsche Bank and former U.S. Federal Reserve chair Ben S. Bernanke
[00:57.20]worry there is a surplus in savings in the world economy.
[01:03.12]They say that can misrepresent the larger investment environment and lead to negative interest rates.
[01:12.56]Negative interest rates mean people would have to pay to keep their savings in a bank.
[01:20.84]In the U.S., surplus savings have pushed the stock market to record highs.
[01:28.00]Experts say the market is nearing a bubble.
[01:33.40]A bubble happens when there is a sudden increase in price over a short time period
[01:39.60]that is not supported by the value of a product.
[01:44.44]In Vietnam, the extra savings has also led to an asset bubble, especially in the housing market.
[01:54.56]Vietnam's economy is growing quickly, but experts disagree on how to explain the wealth that it is being created.
[02:04.60]Researchers at the company Oxford Analytica say there may not be enough productive investments available.
[02:14.20]Savers are investing in luxury real estate that is feeding a bubble.
[02:20.76]But Nielson Vietnam says being able to save so much money is a good sign from consumers.
[02:29.76]Louise Hawley is managing director at Nielsen Vietnam.
[02:35.56]She told VOA that as more and more people feel more certain about their future,
[02:42.04]they are saving more rather than spending today.
[02:47.24]However, the high savings rate could also mean people worry they will need the money for retirement.
[02:56.40]This means Vietnam is part of a global trend identified by Chadha.
[03:03.04]He noted that savings rates are going up, even though interest rates are going down.
[03:11.16]He says people are not saving money to earn interest.
[03:16.48]Instead, Chadha sees this as a sign that people are saving
[03:21.48]because they fear they will not have enough money in the future.
[03:26.96]Vietnam's savings rate is not uncommon.
[03:30.96]Bernanke argued that Asia, especially China, has earned so much from exports
[03:38.56]that the money has aided a worldwide savings surplus.
[03:44.92]Recently, Vietnam has also become one of the developing Asian nations with high exports and a surplus.
[03:54.76]Like China, Vietnam uses its surplus to buy U.S. Treasury bonds.
[04:03.32]The high demand for U.S. bonds is also a reason the U.S. does not have to pay a lot of interest on its bonds.
[04:13.20]This helps to lower interest rates.
[04:18.12]Vietnam also uses its surplus to buy a lot of foreign money, mostly U.S. dollars.
[04:27.08]The U.S. Treasury complained in a report this month
[04:30.92]that this helps increase the value of U.S. dollars and lower the value of the Vietnamese currency.
[04:40.00]Vietnam's exports seem even cheaper at a time when the Trump administration
[04:46.04]wants U.S. consumers to buy fewer Vietnamese products.
[04:52.80]Still, Hawley said there is reason for hope in Vietnam.
[04:58.24]Her company's December survey showed Vietnam has one of the world's
[05:04.00]highest levels of consumer confidence, just after India and the Philippines.
