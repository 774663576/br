。
[00:00.04]A jury in the American state of Georgia
[00:04.12]has found three men guilty of murder
[00:07.16]and other charges in the 2020 killing of Armaud Arbery.
[00:12.68]The men chased the unarmed 25-year-old
[00:16.24]as he was jogging through a neighborhood
[00:19.04]next to his own in southern Georgia.
[00:22.24]One of the men, Travis McMichael, then shot and killed Arbery.
[00:27.40]All three attackers are white.
[00:30.28]Arbery was Black.
[00:32.40]One of the attackers videotaped the killing.
[00:36.72]The jury found 35-year-old Travis McMichael
[00:40.92]guilty of the most serious murder charge.
[00:44.16]His father, 65-year-old Greg McMichael,
[00:48.48]and their friend, 52-year-old William Bryan
[00:52.72]were found guilty of lesser charges of murder.
[00:57.72]The case fueled national anger about race and justice
[01:02.48]after the video was published online,
[01:05.84]two months after the murder.
[01:08.64]State government lawyers did not argue
[01:12.48]that race was a reason for the killing.
[01:15.72]But state prosecutor Linda Dunikoski
[01:20.20]said Arbery presented no danger to the men.
[01:25.20]"They killed him not because he's a threat to them.
[01:29.00]No weapon, no threats, no way to call for help.
[01:34.32]He (Arbery) ran away for five minutes," she said.
[01:41.00]Federal officials have charged the three with hate crimes.
[01:46.64]They accuse the men of killing Arbery
[01:49.92]because he was Black.
[01:51.84]The federal trial is expected to take place in February.
[01:58.28]Other charges against the men include assault,
[02:02.52]false imprisonment and attempted false imprisonment.
[02:09.44]The mostly white Georgia jury
[02:12.20]took about 10 hours to reach its decision.
[02:16.80]The defendants had argued that they suspected Arbery of stealing.
[02:22.64]Defense lawyers said the two were attempting to carry out
[02:27.44]a legal citizen's arrest when they chased Arbery.
[02:32.76]Travis McMichael said that he shot Arbery in self-defense.
[02:40.20]Defense lawyer Jason Sheffield showed jurors video
[02:45.44]which appeared to show Arbery reaching
[02:48.68]for Travis McMichael's gun before the shooting.
[02:53.60]The prosecution answered the claim of self-defense
[02:57.96]by arguing that the defendants had started the incident
[03:02.48]by seeking to stop and question Arbery.
[03:07.76]Before the incident, Arbery was seen leaving an unoccupied,
[03:13.16]partly built house in the neighborhood.
[03:18.08]The state prosecutors said there was no evidence
[03:22.36]that Arbery had done anything illegal
[03:25.56]at the house or in the neighborhood.
[03:30.00]The victim was registered for classes
[03:33.36]at a local college before he was killed.
[03:38.24]Reports say he was studying to be an electrician.
[03:43.60]Arbery's death started nationwide protests last year
[03:48.60]after video of the incident leaked out two months afterwards.
[03:55.32]Police had not charged the defendants with murder
[03:59.28]before that time.
