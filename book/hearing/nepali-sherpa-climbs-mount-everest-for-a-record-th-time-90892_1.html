<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Nepali Sherpa Climbs Mount Everest for a Record 27th Time]

。
[00:01.16]A Nepalese Sherpa mountain guide
[00:04.40]has regained the record for most climbs of Mount Everest.
[00:12.12]On Wednesday morning, 53-year-old Kami Rita Sherpa
[00:18.00]reached the top of the 8,849-meter mountain for the 27th time.
[00:28.76]He was guiding a climber along the traditional southern route.
[00:35.08]Three days earlier, another Nepali, Pasang Dawa Sherpa,
[00:40.80]reached the top for the 26th time,
[00:44.52]tying Kami Rita's earlier record, set last year.
[00:50.68]The season's first groups of climbers
[00:54.56]reached the summit over the weekend.
[00:58.36]Earlier, Sherpa guides had placed ropes and made paths
[01:04.68]for the hundreds of people expected during the climbing season.
[01:11.00]May is the best month to climb Everest because of weather conditions.
[01:18.16]But there are only a few time periods
[01:21.88]during the month with good weather on the highest part of the mountain.
[01:28.16]After May, the summer rainy season arrives,
[01:32.36]bringing snow and clouds.
[01:36.60]This makes the mountain too dangerous to climb.
[01:42.16]Climbers generally reach Everest base camp in April.
[01:47.92]They spend the next weeks training
[01:51.16]to prepare their bodies for the extreme altitude.
[01:56.84]To prepare the path up the mountain,
[01:59.60]Sherpas begin placing, or "fixing" ropes,
[02:04.28]at the end of March or early April.
[02:07.36]By the first or second week of May,
[02:11.32]climbers are usually trying to reach the top.
[02:16.88]However, this year's climbing was delayed
[02:21.08]after an accident with three Sherpas.
[02:26.52]They fell into a deep hole in the ice
[02:30.00]in the dangerous Khumbu Ice Fall area above base camp.
[02:37.04]Rescuers have not been able to find them.
[02:42.04]This year the Nepali government issued
[02:45.00]a record 478 permits to climb Everest.
[02:50.64]Critics say this is dangerous.
[02:55.16]They argue that some of the climbers are inexperienced
[02:59.96]and that the path near the mountain's top can become too crowded.
[03:07.24]This can slow movement and increase the risk of dying.
[03:14.20]In 2019, nine exhausted climbers
[03:18.92]died on Everest after lines built up of climbers going up and down.
[03:26.24]Kami Rita first climbed Everest in 1994
[03:31.04]and has been making the trip nearly every year since then.
[03:37.64]Sherpas are known for their climbing skills,
[03:41.24]and many make a living guiding foreign clients
[03:45.36]up Everest and other mountains.
[03:49.96]Garrett Madison of the U.S.-based Madison Mountaineering company
[03:55.96]has climbed Everest 12 times.
[04:00.24]Five of these climbs were with Kami Rita.
[04:03.96]Speaking by telephone from Everest base camp,
[04:08.32]he told Reuters it was "very inspirational
[04:13.20]to see a local climber continue pushing the limits on Mount Everest."
[04:20.40]Kami Rita's father was among the first Sherpa guides.
[04:27.60]In addition to Everest, Rita has climbed several other peaks
[04:33.00]that are among the world's highest,
[04:36.08]including K-2, Cho-Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse.
[04:44.04]I'm Andrew Smith.
