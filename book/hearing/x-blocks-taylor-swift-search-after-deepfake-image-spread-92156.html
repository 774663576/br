。
[00:01.88]The social media site X
[00:04.32]has blocked some searches for Taylor Swift
[00:07.56]in reaction to an online spread
[00:10.40]of pornographic deepfake images of the singer.
[00:15.48]A "deepfake" is an image,
[00:17.84]sound recording, or video
[00:20.24]created to make it appear
[00:22.24]that people in it are saying or doing things
[00:25.68]that they did not say or do.
[00:29.24]Attempts to search for her name
[00:31.40]without quotation marks on the site Monday
[00:34.68]resulted in a failure message.
[00:38.20]It asked users to retry their search.
[00:42.04]"Don't fret — it's not your fault," also appeared.
[00:47.12]However, putting quotation marks around her name
[00:50.48]permitted posts to show where her name appeared.
[00:54.76]The images of Swift began spreading widely on X last week.
[00:59.56]She is now the most famous victim
[01:02.52]of a danger that technology companies
[01:05.44]and anti-abuse groups have struggled to fix.
[01:10.36]"This is a temporary action
[01:12.52]and done with an abundance of caution
[01:15.16]as we prioritize safety on this issue," Joe Benarroch,
[01:20.28]head of business operations at X, said in a statement.
[01:25.96]After the images began spreading,
[01:28.32]the singer's loyal fan base, called "Swifties,"
[01:31.88]quickly came to her defense.
[01:35.04]They launched a protective movement
[01:37.48]and flooded the site
[01:39.00]with more positive images of the singer.
[01:42.40]They used the hashtag #ProtectTaylorSwift on their posts.
[01:48.24]Some said they were reporting accounts
[01:50.80]that were sharing the deepfakes.
[01:53.88]The deepfake-search group Reality Defender
[01:57.04]said it followed many posts of pornographic material of Swift.
[02:02.32]Many of the posts were found on X,
[02:04.72]formerly known as Twitter.
[02:07.28]Some images also made their way to Facebook
[02:10.24]and other social media sites.
[02:13.40]The researchers found at least 20 different images
[02:16.92]created by artificial intelligence (AI).
[02:21.40]Researchers have said the number of pornographic
[02:24.80]deepfakes has grown in the past few years.
[02:28.88]The increase continues as the technology used
[02:32.16]to produce such images
[02:34.12]has become more available and easier to use.
[02:38.48]In 2019, a report released
[02:40.88]by the AI company DeepTrace Labs
[02:43.80]showed these images
[02:45.32]were mainly weaponized against women.
[02:48.76]Most of the victims, it said,
[02:50.76]were Hollywood actors and South Korean singers.
