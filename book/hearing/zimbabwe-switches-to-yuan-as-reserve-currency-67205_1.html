[00:00.60]Zimbabwe announced last week that it would shift to the Chinese yuan as its reserve currency.
[00:08.04]A reserve currency is a foreign currency held in large quantities by governments and financial institutions to pay international debts.
[00:19.48]"Reserve currency is held in order to support the value of national currencies," writes Justin Kuepper,
[00:27.60]international investing expert, on the website International Invest.
[00:32.68]Patrick Chinamasa is Zimbabwe's Minister of Finance and Economic Development.
[00:39.60]He said China agreed to cancel about $40 million of Zimbabwe's debts this year.
[00:47.52]He also said the move was a sign of the friendship between China and Zimbabwe, a poor country in southern Africa.
[00:56.52]It is also a sign of the growing economic ties between China and Zimbabwe.
[01:03.20]China is Zimbabwe's largest foreign investor,
[01:07.12]with interests ranging from construction and energy to telecommunications.
[01:13.52]China has also become the largest exporter of Zimbabwean products
[01:19.96]– mainly tobacco and minerals, such as gold and diamonds.
[01:25.12]Local economists said Zimbabwe is flooded with foreign currencies since the inflated Zimbabwean dollar collapsed in 2009.
[01:36.04]In 2014, the nation's central bank permitted traders to use the U.S. dollar,
[01:43.84]the South African rand, Botswana's pula, the British pound,
[01:50.40]the euro, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.
[01:59.40]Business consultant Phillip Chiconi says this announcement is unlikely to change things for the businessmen with whom he works.
[02:08.24]"I don't think it will make much difference to anyone, as we're already using foreign currencies," he said.
[02:15.56]Zimbabwe has allowed the yuan as a legal currency for two years.
[02:21.32]But Chiconi said he has not seen it used.
[02:24.76]Instead, most traders prefer the stability of the U.S. dollar,
[02:30.08]which is being used as the country's major currency.
[02:33.32]Zimbabwe suffered economic collapse after years of government mismanagement.
[02:39.64]That caused the Zimbabwean dollar to inflate above 230 million percent.
[02:45.96]Although the central bank printed a 100-trillion-dollar bill, it didn't buy much.
[02:52.76]A loaf of bread cost $300 billion.
[02:57.24]The currency was done away with in 2009.
[03:00.88]The market has stabilized by the U.S. dollar.
[03:04.44]But Zimbabwe's cost of living is still about 60 percent higher than that of neighboring South Africa.
[03:11.92]BancABC chief economist James Wade says the yuan increases Zimbabwe's options.
[03:20.04]"It's not like we're forcing people to use the Chinese yuan,"
[03:23.92]he said. "... we are expanding options that they can use."
[03:28.68]And, he notes, the context matters.
[03:32.44]China's president made a state visit to Zimbabwe this month,
[03:36.68]and signed many economic agreements.
[03:39.76]This included a billion-dollar loan for a thermal power plant.
[03:45.24]If this action brings in more Chinese investment and more development,
[03:50.72]Zimbabweans will profit, no matter what currency they use.
[03:55.80]I'm Mary Gotschall.
