[00:00.04]A federal government report from December
[00:03.56]found that half of all U.S. students started this school year
[00:08.96]behind their grade level in at least one subject.
[00:13.64]Many American education experts say tutoring
[00:17.84]is the best way to help students make up for learning loss
[00:22.08]during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:25.80]But, although many schools have received a lot of federal aid,
[00:30.60]only a small number of students have been getting tutored.
[00:34.60]That finding comes from research
[00:37.44]by the nonprofit news organization Chalkbeat and the Associated Press.
[00:44.16]The two organizations surveyed 12 of the nation's school systems.
[00:49.44]Eight systems provided information.
[00:52.68]The schools reported that fewer than 10 percent of students
