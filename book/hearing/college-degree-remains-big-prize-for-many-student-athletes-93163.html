<p>But Ray Harrison said NIL money was not the reason why he left Presbyterian College and joined the basketball team at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

[00:00.04]Name, image, and likeness, or NIL,
[00:05.16]deals have enabled student-athletes
[00:08.48]to make money while going to college
[00:11.48]in the United States.
[00:13.52]But outside of some big-name athletes,
[00:17.20]many say that a degree remains the biggest,
[00:21.08]most important prize for going to school.
[00:24.96]For years, college athletes could only receive
[00:29.68]free education and living costs
[00:32.76]while competing for school teams.
[00:35.72]But that changed in 2021
[00:38.84]when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that athletes
[00:43.00]could earn money by selling their name,
[00:46.00]image and likeness.
[00:48.52]Well-known athletes like Jayden Daniels,
[00:52.32]now with the Washington Commanders,
[00:55.16]and Caitlin Clark,
[00:57.04]who currently plays for the Indiana Fever,
[01:00.52]made large amounts of money
[01:02.68]while in college.
[01:04.64]But several athletes told The Associated Press
[01:08.56]that the money available to them through NIL
[01:12.44]remains a small consideration
[01:15.20]compared with earning a degree
[01:17.84]and competing in the sports they love.
[01:20.88]NIL deals were not on Jonny Bottorff's mind
[01:25.52]when he transferred to Northern Arizona University
[01:29.60]on a football scholarship
[01:31.84]from a small college in Missouri.
[01:35.68]Bottorff said, "I think the reality for most college athletes
[01:41.04]is things haven't really changed that much.
[01:44.48]We just got an extra little bit of cash in our pockets..."
[01:49.56]For some athletes, NIL money
[01:52.76]is a reason to stay longer in college.
[01:56.28]But Anthony Leal said he is staying
[01:59.72]at Indiana University for a different reason.
[02:04.36]Leal plays for Indiana's basketball team.
[02:08.68]Under college athletic rules,
[02:11.20]he can play four seasons for the team
[02:14.44]within five years.
[02:16.56]Leal already received his undergraduate degree last year.
[02:21.68]But he is coming back as a fifth-year student
[02:25.80]to get a master's in business administration.
[02:29.72]"I'm about 70 percent through the program
[02:33.28]in the Kelley School of Business," he said.
[02:36.72]"I wanted to get that degree."
[02:39.88]Another change in college rules
[02:43.00]also makes it easy for athletes
[02:46.04]to transfer and play the next season.
[02:49.60]Under previous rules,
[02:52.20]athletes had to sit out a year before competing.
[02:57.56]Now, the top athletes can enter
[03:00.44]what is called a transfer portal
[03:03.32]to get more NIL money at another school
[03:07.08]and compete right away.
[03:10.24]University of Nevada,
[03:12.32]Las Vegas football player Matthew Sluka,
[03:15.96]for one, recently left the team in a dispute
[03:20.16]over an NIL payment.
[03:22.88]His representative said he was
[03:25.56]promised payment but never received it.
[03:28.88]But Ray Harrison said NIL money
[03:32.08]was not the reason why he left
[03:34.68]Presbyterian College
[03:36.72]and joined the basketball team
[03:39.16]at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona.
[03:43.68]Harrison said, "I just came out here
[03:47.52]because this is where God led my heart.
[03:50.36]Of course, we win two (conference) championships
[03:54.76]and that changes things."
[03:56.84]A college education remains a dream
[03:59.72]for many younger athletes.
[04:02.12]Tavarius Covington from Chicago
[04:05.20]wants to continue to play football in college.
[04:09.96]He hopes that football will help him
[04:12.72]become the first in his family
[04:15.00]to go to college and earn a business degree.
[04:19.32]He also wants to be an example
[04:22.20]for his younger brother.
[04:24.20]"I want him to know there is more
[04:27.40]to look forward to
[04:28.84]coming out of high school," Covington said.
