<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Why Sri Lanka’s Economy Collapsed and What Is Next]
[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]Sri Lanka's prime minister recently said his nation's
[00:04.92]debt-stricken economy has "collapsed."
[00:09.60]The South Asian island country is running out of money
[00:14.28]to pay for food and fuel.
[00:17.48]It is seeking help from neighboring India and China
[00:21.76]and from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
[00:28.08]Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took office in May.
[00:34.64]He described the difficult task he faces
[00:38.12]in turning around an economy
[00:40.28]that he said is heading for "rock bottom."
[00:44.52]The United Nations World Food Program
[00:48.00]says nearly nine of 10 families in Sri Lanka
[00:52.68]are going without some meals or otherwise
[00:56.40]decreasing how much they eat.
[00:59.88]Three million of the country's 23 million people
[01:04.64]are receiving emergency humanitarian aid.
[01:09.84]Doctors are using social media to try
[01:13.44]and get important supplies of equipment and medicine.
[01:19.04]Growing numbers of Sri Lankans are seeking passports
[01:23.56]to go overseas in search of work.
[01:27.88]Economists say the crisis comes from in-country causes
[01:33.24]such as years of poor leadership and corruption.
[01:38.72]They also say it comes from other troubles,
[01:42.48]such as growing debt, the effects of the pandemic
[01:46.64]and terror attacks that hurt the tourism industry.
[01:52.24]Much of the public's anger has been directed
[01:55.64]at President Gotabaya Rajapaksa
[01:59.20]and his brother, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
[02:05.28]Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa
[02:08.52]resigned after weeks of anti-government protests
[02:12.52]that turned violent.
[02:15.48]The government needed to increase its income
[02:18.72]as foreign debt for large projects increased.
[02:23.40]But instead, Rajapaksa pushed through the largest tax cuts
[02:28.84]in Sri Lankan history, which recently were undone.
[02:34.24]Creditors decreased Sri Lanka's ratings,
[02:37.96]which blocked the country from borrowing more money
[02:42.00]as its foreign reserves fell sharply.
[02:46.12]In April 2021, Rajapaksa suddenly banned
[02:50.88]imports of chemical fertilizers.
[02:54.84]That move decreased the amount of rice produced
[02:58.80]and drove prices higher.
[03:01.16]This year, the war in Ukraine has pushed prices of food and oil higher.
[03:08.96]Inflation was close to 40 percent
[03:12.28]and food prices were up nearly 60 percent in May.
[03:17.88]The Finance Ministry says Sri Lanka has only
[03:21.84]$25 million in usable foreign reserves.
[03:27.60]That has left it without the ability to pay for imports
[03:31.84]or repay billions in debt.
[03:35.28]The local money, the Sri Lankan rupee,
[03:38.72]has weakened in value by nearly 80 percent.
[03:43.40]That makes costs of imports even higher.
[03:48.12]So far, Sri Lanka has gotten through mainly by $4 billion
[03:54.16]in credit lines from neighboring India.
[03:58.12]But Wickremesinghe warned against expecting India
[04:02.76]to keep supporting Sri Lanka.
[04:06.04]The government is in negotiations with the IMF on a bailout plan.
[04:12.64]Wickremesinghe said Wednesday
[04:15.32]he expects to have some agreement
[04:17.60]with the IMF by late July.
[04:21.08]The government also is seeking more help from China.
[04:26.12]Other governments like the U.S., Japan, and Australia
[04:30.76]have provided a few hundred million dollars in extra support.
[04:36.68]Earlier this month, the United Nations
[04:39.60]began asking countries around the world to help.
[04:44.24]So far, the estimated financial help
[04:47.24]is not close to the $6 billion the country needs
[04:51.24]to keep running over the next six months.
