。
[00:00.04]Henk Schiffmacher is a famous Dutch tattoo artist.
[00:05.56]That means he draws pictures in permanent ink on people's skin.
[00:11.08]Recently, he created the design of an elephant
[00:15.68]on Lilian Rachmaran's back.
[00:18.60]"Highbrow to lowbrow" is how the artist described his latest project.
[00:25.12]The project involves "inking" artwork by Rembrandt van Rijn
[00:30.64]onto the skin of visitors
[00:33.28]to the building the famous Dutch painter once called home.
[00:38.32]The Rembrandt House Museum has changed one of its rooms
[00:43.28]into a tattoo area for something it calls,
[00:47.72]"The Poor Man's Rembrandt."
[00:50.20]The one-week event involves Schiffmacher
[00:54.04]and other top Amsterdam tattoo artists.
[00:58.12]For between about $54 and $270,
[01:03.84]visitors can get their own permanent reminder of Rembrandt.
[01:09.28]Schiffmacher told The Associated Press, "It's a juxtaposition —
[01:14.80]a jump from high to low, from highbrow to lowbrow."
[01:20.56]He added, "And it's great that these two worlds can visit one another.
[01:26.00]Actually, it's really one world because it's about art."
[01:31.28]Museum Director Milou Halbesma
[01:34.68]said the event is a way of bringing new visitors
[01:38.64]to the historic house and getting people closer to the artist.
[01:44.64]"I think it's a very good...way to have your own Rembrandt," she said.
[01:50.84]The event has already proved a hit.
[01:54.08]All appointments available online
[01:57.36]were filled within 10 minutes, she said.
[02:00.80]However, there are still some spots available
[02:04.96]for people who walk into the museum and wait their turn.
[02:10.36]Schiffmacher and others have taken some of Rembrandt's drawings
[02:15.44]and changed them to work for tattooing.
[02:19.16]For example, the artists make lines thinner,
[02:23.24]so they do not grow together as the skin of the tattooed person ages.
[02:29.88]The tattoo artists see similarities between their work
[02:34.60]and the artist's quick drawings — but there is one big difference.
[02:40.44]"The canvas is different," Schiffmacher said.
[02:44.68]"The canvas can talk to you, move too much, float, even faint.
[02:50.32]That didn't happen for Rembrandt."
[02:54.00]Rachmaran works at the museum.
[02:56.92]She was the first person in Schiffmacher's chair.
[03:00.68]She got his version of one of Rembrandt's
[03:04.52]famous drawings of an Asian elephant.
[03:08.28]The creature, named Hansken, first arrived in Amsterdam
[03:13.60]in 1633 on a ship from Ceylon —
[03:18.00]now Sri Lanka — as a gift for the Prince of Orange.
[03:23.40]Rachmaran said, "I love the animals,
[03:26.76]they're so spiritual and smart..."
[03:29.52]Speaking about her tattoo, Rachmaran added,
[03:33.56]"I'm very honored to have one made by Henk himself."
