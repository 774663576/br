[00:00.04]Ukrainian students seeking to attend college in the United States
[00:06.16]are receiving assistance from many American schools.
[00:11.64]A recent report covering 559 schools
[00:16.92]found that at least 120 universities
[00:21.40]are offering some kind of assistance to Ukrainian students.
[00:27.20]The nonprofit Institute of International Education (IIE)
[00:33.64]prepared the report.
[00:35.88]The assistance includes extra time to complete applications
[00:42.52]and eased requirements to provide some official documents.
[00:48.44]U.S. colleges have also expanded financial aid
[00:54.04]and increased the number of positions for Ukrainian students.
[01:00.00]The University of Chicago launched a $20 million program
[01:06.12]that includes tuition for Ukrainian students.
[01:10.24]Texas A&amp;M is also providing assistance for tuition and living costs.
[01:18.60]Hampton University in Virginia invited up to 100 students
[01:24.84]affected by the war to study for free during the summer.
[01:30.16]As the war in Ukraine enters its sixth month,
[01:35.28]some students are now arriving at U.S. colleges to begin the school year.
[01:41.64]Jason Czyz, co-president at IIE,
[01:46.32]called U.S. higher education a "safe haven" for international students.
[01:53.48]The Ukrainian students had to overcome many barriers to reach America.
[02:00.32]The U.S. embassy in Kyiv is not issuing student visas.
[02:06.80]Students were forced to visit diplomatic offices elsewhere.
[02:12.16]Making such a trip is especially difficult for men,
[02:17.28]who must prove they are students to avoid serving in the military.
[02:23.20]Eighteen-year-old Oleksandr Sinhayivskyy is one example.
[02:29.88]The young man will attend Georgetown University
[02:34.24]in Washington D.C. this fall.
[02:37.24]He ended up traveling to Romania to get a visa
[02:41.96]and Georgetown paid for his hotel stay.
[02:46.44]Sinhayivskyy told Reuters news agency

[02:54.96]But after experiencing the destruction in his country,
[02:59.68]he decided to study international relations
[03:03.64]and become a politician in Ukraine.
[03:07.60]"I did not change the direction
[03:10.80]with my own compass," Sinhayivskyy said.
[03:15.04]Instead, he said the events happening in his country
[03:19.12]had pointed him in another direction.
[03:22.32]Another student, Hlib Burtsev,
[03:26.00]imagined himself filming his reaction
[03:29.60]to the application decisions from U.S. universities.
[03:34.04]But when those decisions came,
[03:37.28]the 18-year-old was often sitting in a windowless room
[03:42.04]or bomb shelter in Kyiv.
[03:45.68]About a month after Russia invaded Ukraine,
[03:49.72]Burtsev was accepted into Rhode Island's Brown University for this fall.
[03:56.00]The school also invited him to attend school for the summer
[04:01.56]and paid for his food, flights and housing.
[04:05.88]"I didn't expect such support from a university
