[00:00.04]More restaurants in Japan are offering bugs in their dishes.
[00:06.24]On a recent vacation in Tokyo,
[00:09.12]Takumi Yamamoto ate a special lunch of cricket curry
[00:14.56]and silkworm sashimi, which is usually made with raw fish.
[00:20.28]He drank a water bug cider.
[00:24.88]The 26-year-old office worker
[00:27.48]is one of many people around the world
[00:30.44]with a growing interest in entomophagy,
[00:33.80]or the practice of eating insects.
[00:36.72]Bugs are slowly becoming more usable as a food source.
[00:42.88]Yamamoto said he sometimes ate grasshoppers
[00:46.64]dipped in soy sauce as a child.
[00:49.64]In Tokyo, he ate insect foods at Take-Noko cafe,
[00:55.28]which serves many bug dishes.
[00:59.00]"It's fun to select from a wider variety of dishes," Yamamoto said.
[01:04.04]"Everything was tasty.
[01:06.52]In particular, the water bug cider was quite refreshing ...
[01:10.60]like a green apple."
[01:13.96]Entomophagy started to be taken seriously
[01:17.44]after the United Nations declared bugs a good source of protein
[01:22.28]to feed a growing world population.
[01:26.08]With livestock farming's effects on climate change
[01:29.92]and world hunger issues from weather and war,
[01:33.84]there has been more interest in the nutrition bugs can provide.
[01:40.20]Some people think eating insects is just gross.
[01:43.76]But Japan has a rich history of using insects as food.
[01:50.56]Grasshoppers, silkworms and wasps
[01:54.44]were traditionally eaten in areas
[01:56.72]of the country with little meat and fish.
[02:00.04]It was a practice that grew in popularity
[02:03.64]because of food shortages during and after World War II,
[02:09.28]said Take-Noko manager Michiko Miura.
[02:14.48]"Recently, there have been advances in rearing things
[02:18.08]like crickets and mealworms for food,

[02:33.08]made from cricket flour.
[02:36.76]Interest has also grown at Take-Noko,

[02:54.60]and the cider contains water bug extract
[02:58.56]and is topped with a whole insect.
[03:02.80]Takeo Saito started the restaurant.
[03:06.80]He also has a packaged food company
[03:10.40]that offers more than 60 kinds of bug foods,
