。
[00:07.84]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.04]from VOA Learning English.
[00:18.88]Today we talk about being in a good place.
[00:23.24]And we begin with an old American pop singer.
[00:28.84]When Karen Carpenter sings
[00:30.84]about being "on top of the world,"
[00:33.36]she describes feeling happy,
[00:36.48]thankful, and being in a great place.
[00:41.24]If you are on top of the world,
[00:43.60]you are in a great position.
[00:46.20]You are happy with life.
[00:49.08]When things are really going your way,
[00:51.76]you can also say you are sitting pretty.
[00:55.68]Sitting pretty, means you are in
[00:58.44]a very favorable situation.
[01:02.00]You love your job.
[01:03.76]You have a nice home.
[01:05.56]And your finances are in good order.
[01:09.68]This expression can also mean
[01:12.12]you are in a good, safe, and secure position.
[01:15.80]You don't need to worry about the future.
[01:19.96]It can also mean you are in
[01:22.36]an advantageous position.
[01:25.12]For example, when a friend of mine bought property,
[01:28.84]she found herself in a price war with another buyer.
[01:34.48]However, she was sitting pretty for several reasons:
[01:38.72]She offered a big down payment
[01:41.72]and a flexible move-in date.
[01:45.60]This example shows how sitting pretty
[01:48.20]can have a little difference in meaning
[01:50.76]than other similar expressions.
[01:53.68]It can suggest that you are in a good situation,
[01:58.28]especially when others are not.
[02:02.16]As we said, we have other expressions
[02:04.92]that mean about the same thing
[02:06.96]as being on top the world and sitting pretty.
[02:12.08]If you are in a great situation
[02:14.68]and have a favorable position,
[02:17.32]you can also say you have it made.
[02:20.48]You are ahead of the game.
[02:23.24]You are going places.
[02:26.88]If you feel great about your life
[02:29.32]and just feel great in general,
[02:31.36]you might say you are on cloud nine.
[02:35.88]The origin of this cloud expression
[02:38.60]comes from the field of agriculture.
[02:42.16]The Farmer's Almanac explains
[02:44.76]that scientists wanted to make
[02:47.32]recording cloud observations easier.
[02:50.88]So, they rated clouds zero to nine.
[02:54.96]Zero represented the lowest clouds
[02:58.92]and nine the highest clouds.
[03:03.08]Word experts say this is where the expression
[03:06.32]to be on cloud nine probably comes from.
[03:10.64]If you're on cloud nine
[03:12.76]you'll be very high up
[03:14.56]which may also describe your feelings.
[03:19.44]And that's all the time we have
[03:21.36]for this Words and Their Stories.
[03:23.76]When it comes to your English studies,
[03:26.44]we hope all of you are on cloud nine.
[03:30.12]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.
