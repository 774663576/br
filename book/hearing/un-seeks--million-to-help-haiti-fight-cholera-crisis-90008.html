<p>The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) estimates at least 175 people have died from the latest Cholera outbreak and more than 7,600 have been hospitalized. The actual number of cases is likely much higher because of under-reporting of the disease.</p>

<p>The number of patients seeking help at Doctors Without Borders hospitals in the capital of Port-au-Prince greatly increased in recent weeks. So far, more than 6,500 patients have been admitted.

[00:00.04]The United Nations and Haiti
[00:03.24]are seeking $146 million
[00:07.72]to help fight a cholera outbreak
[00:11.16]that has already killed at least 175 people.
[00:17.52]Health officials in Haiti
[00:20.20]say cholera cases have quickly been rising
[00:24.36]since life started returning to normal after a fuel blockade
[00:29.76]halted many forms of business and services.
[00:34.72]The blockade forced gas stations to close,
[00:39.12]hospitals to reduce services
[00:42.20]and banks and stores to limit hours.
[00:46.08]The blockade was established in mid-September
[00:50.84]by a powerful Haitian gang.
[00:53.40]The gang recently lifted the blockade
[00:57.32]and gas stations reopened last weekend across Haiti.
[01:03.04]Dr. Jeanty Fils is a spokesman
[01:07.44]for Haiti's Ministry of Health.
[01:10.60]He told The Associated Press that people
[01:14.64]are back on the streets and likely spreading cholera
[01:19.16]as the government struggles to contain the problem.
[01:23.36]"We need more resources," Fils said.
[01:27.76]"Cholera cases continue to climb in Haiti."
[01:32.40]The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)
[01:38.08]estimates at least 175 people have died
[01:43.28]from the latest Cholera outbreak
[01:46.12]and more than 7,600 have been hospitalized.
[01:51.68]The actual number of cases is likely much higher
[01:55.92]because of under-reporting of the disease.
[02:00.28]The worsening situation in Haiti led the government,
[02:04.88]the U.N. and other partners to appeal
[02:08.92]for $146 million to help fight cholera.
[02:15.08]Health officials fear that at least half a million people in Haiti
[02:20.84]are at risk of becoming infected.
[02:23.76]Ulrika Richardson is a Special U.N. Representative in Haiti.
[02:30.28]She called the rising case count
[02:33.80]and fast spread of the disease across the country "worrying."
[02:39.76]Fils noted that cholera cases were likely contained
[02:45.16]during the fuel blockade since gas stations were closed
[02:49.84]and many in the country of
[02:52.24]more than 11 million people remained home.
[02:56.56]Stephanie Mayronne is a medical operations official

[03:04.60]She said if people sickened with cholera
[03:08.60]start traveling to areas with poor sanitation

[04:09.24]and planning to launch vaccination campaigns.
