。
[00:00.04]More than 3 million jobless Americans asked the United States government for financial assistance last week.
[00:11.40]That is a record number for one week, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday.
[00:20.00]The old record had been 695,000 from 1982.
[00:28.20]This is the beginning of the really bad numbers we are going to see for the next few months, said Subadra Rajappa.
[00:39.40]She is head of U.S. Rates Strategy at Societe Generale in New York City.
[00:48.24]Also on Thursday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, told NBC television
[00:57.04]that "the U.S. may already be in recession," as many companies have suspended operations.
[01:06.12]Schools, movie theaters and other businesses have closed
[01:11.12]as Americans turn to social distancing to slow the growth of coronavirus.
[01:19.16]The central bank chair added that progress in controlling the spread of the coronavirus
[01:26.16]will decide when the economy can fully reopen.
[01:32.56]Wednesday night, the U.S. Senate approved a $2 trillion bill
[01:38.20]to help people and businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.
[01:45.12]The measure is the largest stimulus bill in American history.
[01:50.60]The House of Representatives is expected to pass it on Friday.
[01:57.60]Once signed into law, it will provide direct payments to many Americans
[02:04.12]as well as provide money to businesses that are hurting.
[02:09.68]Lawmakers hope the bill will prevent the economy from heading into a long economic depression,
[02:17.72]such as the one the United States experienced in the 1930s.
[02:24.64]U.S. President Donald Trump said this week that he would like to see Americans go back to work by Easter, April 12.
[02:35.72]He suggested that efforts to slow the virus may no longer be needed at that date.
[02:43.00]However, several companies and business groups are listening to health officials
[02:49.36]who say Americans need to stay home for a much longer amount of time.
[02:56.76]"We urge all businesses and the public to listen to public health officials
[03:03.16]when it comes to social distancing," says Neil Bradley of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
[03:12.00]But some business leaders agree with the president.
[03:16.72]Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankenfein wrote:
[03:22.64]"Crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue."
[03:29.48]His comments appeared on Twitter.
