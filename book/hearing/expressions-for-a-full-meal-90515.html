<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>For today's program, we invite you to share a meal with us – well, expressions about a meal, that is.</p>
<p>Like most languages, English is filled with food expressions. Today we will start with two <strong>appetizers</strong>, continue with the main <strong>dish</strong>, and finish with <strong>dessert</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Diego Guerrero, from left, Carlos Sanchez, Mila, Ines Andres, Carlota Andres, Jose Andres and Pepa Mu&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;241;oz enjoy a meal in a scene from the Discovery + television series Jose Andres and Family in Spain.

<p>In other words, we will take you <u>from soup to nuts</u> – or from the beginning to the end. With many meals, soup comes first and nuts come last. So, if you do something <u>from soup to nuts</u> you do everything from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p><strong>Appetizer</strong></p>
<p>An appetizer is the first part of a meal. Our first appetizer today is <u>alphabet soup</u>.</p>
<p>When you have a collection of letters of the alphabet that stand for several words, we can call it an <u>alphabet soup</u>. These can be the letters that show a job, such as COO or Chief Operating Officer. They could be letters that show someone's education, like an MBA for a Master of Business Administration and a Ph.D. for a Doctor of Philosophy.</p>
<p>Let's say someone hands you their <strong>business card</strong>. After their name are the letters MBA, Ph.D., and COO. You can say, "Wow, that is quite the <u>alphabet soup</u> after your name. But what is it you do exactly?"</p>
<p>Now, let's move on to the next appetizer – salad.</p>
<p>A <strong>salad</strong> usually has some kind of vegetables mixed with cheese, egg, meat, nuts, or, sometimes, fruit. Well, when we have a mixture of words or phrases that are difficult to understand, we can call it a <u>word salad</u>.</p>
<p>Word experts say that in the past, <u>word salad</u> described difficult-to-understand spoken language from people with illnesses. However, in recent years, the expression <u>word salad</u> has come to simply mean difficult-to-understand language.</p>
<p><strong>Main dish</strong></p>
<p>Now, let's move on to the main dish – in this case, a sandwich. You can make a sandwich from anything – meat, cheese, vegetables, tofu, fish, shrimp, or chicken. Just put them between two pieces of bread and you have a sandwich.</p>
<p>You can even make a sandwich from ... criticism!</p>
<p>A <u>criticism sandwich</u> is a way to soften the <strong>delivery </strong>of bad news. You put the criticism between two nice things – such as praise or approval.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>So, your performance in last week's sales meeting was great! Thanks for your help. But I'll need you to clean up the report. I saw a few things wrong with the numbers. But yeah, the client really loved your presentation!</em></p>
<p>That could also be called a <u>feedback sandwich</u>. But it is made the same way!</p>
<p><strong>Dessert</strong></p>
<p>If you love sweets, you will love dessert.</p>
<p>Now, I could use <u>easy as pie</u> or <u>a piece of cake</u> as examples. Both describe something very easy to do or finish. But I am going to use my favorite dessert – cookies!</p>
<p>Some cookies are formed by hand and their shapes can be very different from one another. However, some people use a device called a cookie cutter when making cookies. With a cookie cutter, every cookie is the same shape with little difference.</p>
<p>And that gives us the expression <u>cookie-cutter</u>. It describes something similar to many other things. There is nothing special, extraordinary, or different about things that are <u>cookie-cutter</u>.</p>
<p>For example, houses in my neighborhood were made by the same builders. They are all the same size and shape. In other words, the houses in my neighborhood are cookie-cutter houses.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me for this <strong>lunchtime</strong> version of <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>
