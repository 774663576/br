<div class="content">Hundreds of thousands of people normally attend a new American president's inauguration. But the first day of Joe Biden's presidency will be very different.
通常会有数十万人参加新任美国总统的就职典礼。但是乔·拜登总统上任第一天会大有不同。
<p>Because of the coronavirus crisis, the official presidential swearing-in ceremony – to be held January 20 - was already going to be more low-key.
因为新冠病毒危机，定于1月20日举行的总统正式宣誓就职仪式原本已经很是低调。</p>
<p>But after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, heightened security measures will also be in place and crowds will be further limited. A high-security area is being established around the Capitol, the White House and the National Mall.<br/>
但是在1月6日美国国会大厦遇袭之后，美国也将进一步采取安全措施，人群将进一步受到限制。在国会大厦、白宫和国家广场附近将会建立一个高度安全的区域。</p>
<p>The U.S. Secret Service is in charge of the inauguration. Michael Plati is the agent in charge. He said to help deal with possible security threats, there will be increased communication between local and federal police. His agency will also cooperate closely with the Department of Defense and Homeland Security officials.<br/>
美国特勤局负责总统就职典礼。迈克尔·普拉蒂是特勤局局长。他说，为了帮助应对可能的安全威胁，地方和联邦警察之间将会加强交流。特勤局还将与国防部以及国土安全部官员密切合作。</p>
<p>Plati said he sees the inauguration and the attack on the U.S. Capitol as two very different events. For example, he said the inauguration is planned far in advance. Unlike what happened at the Capitol on January 6, agencies have plans in place to prevent possible violence.<br/>
普拉蒂表示，他认为就职典礼和国会大厦遇袭是两个截然不同的事件。例如，他说就职典礼是提前计划好的。与1月6日在国会大厦发生的情况不同，各机构制定了防止可能发生暴力事件的方案。</p>
<p>In addition to local and federal police officers, there will be 10,000 National Guard soldiers on duty.<br/>
除了地方和联邦警察之外，还将会有1万名国民警卫队士兵执勤。</p>
<p>Earlier, the coronavirus was the main concern ahead of this year's inauguration. Now, the combination of possible violence and the continued spread of the virus across the U.S. will make this one of the most unusual inaugurations ever.<br/>
此前，新冠病毒是今年就职典礼前最受关注的对象。现在，潜在暴力事件和美国各地病毒持续传播相结合，使得这次将会成为有史以来最不寻常的就职典礼之一。</p>
<p>There will be no large crowds. President-elect Biden will make his way from the Capitol to the White House, but it will not be in the usual public parade. Instead, this will be a virtual event that people can watch online and on television.<br/>
现场不会有很多人。候选总统拜登将从国会大厦前往白宫，但是不是处于通常的民众巡游中。相反，这将是一次虚拟巡游，人们可以在网上和电视上观看。</p>
<p>Many of the traditional speeches and warm wishes that go along with an inauguration will also be completed online. There will not be a special celebration, known as a ball, that night. That event will also happen online and on television.<br/>
就职典礼上许多传统演讲和良好祝愿也将在网上完成。那天晚上不会举办被称为舞会的特别庆祝活动。该活动也将在网上和电视上直播。</p>
<p>Organizers say the events will center around the subject "America United." Throughout his campaign for president, Biden has talked about being a president for all the people and has suggested he will seek to heal a nation divided by major political disputes.<br/>
组织者表示，活动将会围绕“团结美国”的主题展开。在总统竞选期间，拜登谈到要成为全体美国人的总统，并表示他将寻求“愈合”这个因重大政治争端而分裂的国家。</p>
<p>Hollywood actor Tom Hanks will host a special television event to welcome Biden to the White House. Musical performances will be given by Justin Timberlake, Jon Bon Jovi and Demi Lovato.<br/>
好莱坞演员汤姆·汉克斯将主持一场特殊的电视节目，以欢迎拜登入住白宫。音乐表演将由贾斯汀·汀布莱克，乔恩·邦·乔维和黛咪·洛瓦托进行。</p>
<p>Here is an example of how few people will attend the inauguration. Usually, each member of congress receives about 40 tickets to be given to friends and supporters from their states to attend.<br/>
以下举例来说参加总统就职典礼的人数是如何少之又少。通常每名国会议员都会得到大约40张门票，用于分发给他们的朋友以及所在州的支持者来参加就职典礼。</p>
<p>Under that system, at least 20,000 special visitors were invited to come to the inauguration. This year, each member of congress gets only two tickets. That adds up to just over 1000 guests.<br/>
根据这一体系，至少会有2万名特殊来宾被邀请前来参加就职典礼。今年，每名国会议员只得到两张门票。这加起来也只有刚过1000名来宾。</p>
<p>In most years, people without tickets were permitted to watch the ceremony on the National Mall, the large public area that stretches from the Capitol Building to the Lincoln Memorial.<br/>
在大多数年份，没有门票的人们会被允许在国家广场观看就职典礼，国家广场是指从国会大厦一直延伸到林肯纪念堂的大型公共区域。</p>
<p>But this year, the National Park Service is urging people to stay home. The Washington Monument, the famous centerpiece that rises above the Mall, will be closed.<br/>
但是今年，国家公园管理局督促人们留在家里。国家广场上著名的核心景点华盛顿纪念碑将被关闭。</p>
<p>There will, however, be a representation of all of the people who usually attend the inauguration. There will be nearly 200,000 U.S. flags planted in the ground, along with a display of 56 high-powered lights. The lights will represent the U.S. states and territories.<br/>
但是通常参加总统就职典礼的所有人员会有一个代表。地面上将被插上20万面美国国旗，以及展示56盏高功率灯。这些灯将代表美国各州以及领地。</p>
<p>One person is definitely staying home: President Donald Trump. The outgoing leader who was impeached for the second time last week has said he will not attend.<br/>
有一个人肯定会待在家里，他就是川普总统。这位上周被第二次弹劾的即将离任的领导人表示他不会出席这次典礼。</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence will be there. So will former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Biden will lead the small group to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.<br/>
副总统迈克·彭斯将会出席。前总统奥巴马、小布什以及克林顿也将出席。拜登将带领这一小群人前往弗吉尼亚州的阿灵顿国家公墓，为无名战士墓献上花圈。</p>
<p>Tony Allen is in charge of Biden's inaugural committee. He said the goal of this year's inaugural activities is to show the nation "that we are stronger together than we are apart."<br/>
托尼·艾伦负责拜登的就职典礼委员会。他说，今年就职典礼活动的目标是向全国表明“我们团结起来要比分裂更强大。”</p>
<p>Biden is set to take the oath of office on January 20 at noon.<br/>
拜登将于1月20日中午宣誓就职。</p>

。
[00:00.04]Hundreds of thousands of people
[00:03.68]normally attend a new American president's inauguration.
[00:08.64]But the first day of Joe Biden's presidency will be very different.
[00:15.00]Because of the coronavirus crisis,
[00:18.56]the official presidential swearing-in ceremony
[00:22.60]– to be held January 20 - was already going to be more low-key.
[00:28.56]But after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6,
[00:34.68]heightened security measures will also be in place
[00:38.96]and crowds will be further limited.
[00:42.64]A high-security area is being established around the Capitol,
[00:47.76]the White House and the National Mall.
[00:51.48]The U.S. Secret Service is in charge of the inauguration.
[00:56.84]Michael Plati is the agent in charge.
[01:00.72]He said to help deal with possible security threats,
[01:05.32]there will be increased communication
[01:08.56]between local and federal police.
[01:11.88]His agency will also cooperate closely
[01:15.88]with the Department of Defense and Homeland Security officials.
[01:21.60]Plati said he sees the inauguration and the attack
[01:26.28]on the U.S. Capitol as two very different events.
[01:31.24]For example, he said the inauguration is planned far in advance.
[01:37.80]Unlike what happened at the Capitol on January 6,
[01:42.92]agencies have plans in place to prevent possible violence.
[01:49.04]In addition to local and federal police officers,

[01:58.76]Earlier, the coronavirus was the main concern
[02:04.12]ahead of this year's inauguration.
[02:07.40]Now, the combination of possible violence
[02:12.28]and the continued spread of the virus across the U.S.
[02:17.48]will make this one of the most unusual inaugurations ever.

[03:32.00]divided by major political disputes.
[03:36.00]Hollywood actor Tom Hanks will host a special television event
[03:41.80]to welcome Biden to the White House.
