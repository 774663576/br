<p>In 1986, the Atlanta-based Carter Center joined the WHO and UNICEF in the fight against Guinea worm disease.

[00:00.04]The Carter Center said recently
[00:03.24]that only 13 human cases of Guinea worm disease
[00:07.92]were reported worldwide last year.
[00:10.80]That is a major drop from 3.5 million cases
[00:15.80]of infected people in 1986.
[00:19.60]These early numbers are expected
[00:22.40]to be confirmed in the coming months.
[00:25.32]Still, the Carter Center,
[00:27.92]founded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter
[00:31.52]and his wife, Eleanor Rosalynn Carter,
[00:34.44]said the last part of the international effort
[00:37.80]to end the parasitic disease will be "the most difficult."
[00:42.12]Guinea worm is a disease that affects poor communities
[00:46.80]in distant parts of Africa and Asia
[00:50.16]that do not have safe water to drink.
[00:52.84]People who drink unclean water
[00:55.68]can get parasites that can grow up to 1 meter.
[00:59.60]The worm grows in people
[01:01.80]for up to a year before painfully coming out,
[01:05.20]often through the feet or other sensitive parts of the body.
[01:10.08]The World Health Organization (WHO)
[01:14.16]says there is neither a drug treatment for Guinea worm disease
[01:18.32]nor a vaccine to prevent it.
[01:21.56]Guinea worm disease can be prevented
[01:24.20]by training people to filter and drink clean water.
[01:28.48]In 1986, the Atlanta-based Carter Center
[01:33.32]joined the WHO and UNICEF
[01:36.40]in the fight against Guinea worm disease.
[01:40.32]The center said the remaining infections
[01:43.32]occurred in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
[01:47.32]Six human cases were reported in Chad,
[01:51.12]five in South Sudan, one in Ethiopia
[01:54.88]and one in the Central African Republic.
[01:58.56]The Central African Republic case remains under investigation.
[02:03.72]Adam Weiss is the director of The Carter Center's
[02:07.68]Guinea Worm Eradication Program.
[02:10.48]Weiss told The Associated Press that the final efforts to eradicate,
[02:15.88]or completely end, the disease could be difficult.
[02:20.08]Weiss said the populations where Guinea worm still exists
[02:25.16]often face insecurity, including conflict,
[02:28.60]which can prevent workers and volunteers
[02:31.72]from going house to house to offer support.
[02:35.40]Weiss cautioned if support for these communities slows or stops
[02:40.64]"there's no question that you're going to see a surge in Guinea worm."
[02:45.36]He added, "We're continuing to make progress,
[02:48.96]even if it is not as fast as we all want it to be,
[02:53.72]but that progress continues."
[02:56.40]Guinea worm could be the second human disease
[02:59.32]to be ended after smallpox, says The Carter Center.
[03:03.80]I'm John Russell.
