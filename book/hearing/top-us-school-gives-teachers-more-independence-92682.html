<p>But at A.D. Henderson School in Boca Raton, Florida, school leaders permit their staff high levels of classroom autonomy — and it works.</p>
<p>Henderson is a public school of 636 kindergartners to eighth graders on the campus of Florida Atlantic University. Henderson students scored in the top 1 percent to 3 percent in nearly every subject in the state's latest standardized tests. In almost every subject, 60 percent or more of Henderson students scored far above the Florida state average.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of our own individual input <strong>allowed</strong> in doing the activities that we want to do in the classroom," said Vanessa Stevenson. She is a middle school science teacher at Henderson. She plans to start a horse medicine class next fall even though the school has no horses. She believes she will find a way to make the class a success.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of <strong>trial</strong> and error because there's nothing being handed to you saying, ‘Do it this way.' You just have to figure it out," she said.</p>
<p>Joel Herbst is the <strong>superintendent</strong> of Henderson and its partner FAU High School. He called the teachers his "<strong>secret sauce</strong>." He said the school's success can be done anywhere if administrators give teachers more freedom.</p>
<p>When that happens, he said, teachers create hands-on programs that help students learn more.</p>
<p>"Give (teachers) the freedom to do what they do best, which is to <strong>impart</strong> knowledge, to teach beyond the textbook," Herbst said.</p>
<p>Madhu Narayanan is an education professor at Portland State University. He studies teacher independence. He said independence is highly related to teacher <strong>morale</strong> and success. But independence must be combined with administrative support.</p>
<p>"It can't be, ‘Here is the classroom, here is the textbook, we'll see you in six months.' Those teachers have <strong>tremendous</strong> autonomy, but feel lost," he said.</p>
<p>About 2,700 families enter a <strong>lottery</strong> each year for the 60 spots in Henderson's kindergarten class and openings in other grades.</p>
<p>Some children entering Henderson are <strong>gifted</strong>. Some have learning disabilities. Most are average learners, however.</p>
<p>The school must follow a Florida law that requiring the student population at university-run "laboratory" schools to match state population demographics for race, <strong>gender </strong>and <strong>income</strong>. Because families <strong>apply</strong> to attend, parental involvement is high.</p>
<p>Jenny O'Sullivan teaches a class on art and technology. Her kindergartners learn computer coding basics by playing a game with a robot. And fourth and fifth graders make videos celebrating Earth Day.</p>
<p>Her new classroom has the newest technology. But she says such classes can be taught anywhere if the teacher is given the ability to be creative.</p>
<p>Amy Miramontes teaches sixth graders a Medical Detectives class. They examine pieces of rabbit muscle under a microscope, using safe chemicals to find what disease each animal had.</p>
<p>Miramontes hopes the class grows students' interest in medicine. She also hopes her class gives students the knowledge needed in two years when they take the state's eighth-grade science test.</p>
<p><strong>Using art to teach science</strong></p>
<p>Henderson's success has led to more money and <strong>grants</strong>. The middle school's drone program, for example, recently won a national competition in California.</p>
<p>Henderson's drone teams have a room to practice flying the devices through an obstacle course, plus flight simulators donated by the local power company. The drone program is a chance to compete while using the physics and aeronautics learned in the classroom, teacher James Nance said.</p>
<p>Eighth grader Anik Sahai is in Stevenson's science class. He created an app that uses the camera to <strong>diagnose</strong> diabetic retinopathy. The eye disease is a leading cause of blindness worldwide.</p>
<p>Sahai's app took first place in the state's middle school science fair and is being considered for commercial use. The 14-year-old credits his success to his years at Henderson, beginning in the preschool program.</p>
<p>"The teachers here, they're amazing," he said. "They've been trained on how to get us to the next level."</p>

[00:00.04]When teachers at one of the top
[00:02.36]public schools in Florida
[00:04.36]are asked how they succeed,
[00:06.72]one answer is universal:
[00:09.12]They have autonomy in the classroom.
[00:13.00]Teachers with autonomy
[00:14.96]are able to make decisions
[00:16.76]and plans independently in their classrooms.
[00:20.32]The majority of American teachers report
[00:23.44]feeling stressed and unhappy at work,
[00:26.44]a Pew Research Center study found last year.
[00:30.20]Another study by Brown University
[00:33.12]and the University of Albany
[00:35.32]found that reduced job satisfaction
[00:38.32]has been connected to a drop in teachers'
[00:41.04]sense of autonomy in the classroom.
