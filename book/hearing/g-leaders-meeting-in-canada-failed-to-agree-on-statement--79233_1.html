。
[00:01.04]American President Donald Trump criticized the United States' trade partners,
[00:07.71]including those in Europe and Canada, on Monday.
[00:12.80]Trump wrote on Twitter that the U.S. will no longer accept
[00:18.89]what he called unfair trade, even from friendly countries.
[00:26.28]"We must put the American worker first," he tweeted.
[00:30.52]On Saturday, he called the situation "Trade Abuse."
[00:38.36]Trump tweeted Monday from Singapore.

[01:29.00]After it ended, U.S. President Donald Trump published a tweet
[01:34.56]that said he had told his trade representatives "not to endorse the Communique."
[01:43.72]Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
[01:47.10]spoke to reporters at the close of the meeting on Saturday.
[01:52.48]He said that Canada would order "retaliatory" measures
[01:57.76]against U.S. products as soon as July 1.
[02:04.04]The Trump administration ordered taxes on steel and aluminum imports
[02:09.82]from Canada and other allies earlier this year.
[02:15.64]Trudeau said that Canada would "not be pushed around."
[02:21.88]Several leaders said they did not support the idea of Russia
[02:27.28]rejoining the group of economic powers.
[02:31.60]Russia was expelled after it took over Crimea in 2014.
[02:39.32]Members also say Russia continues to support separatists in eastern Ukraine.
[02:48.84]Trudeau said he was not "remotely interested" in having Russia rejoin the group.
[02:56.64]British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed.
[03:00.70]She said Russia had failed to meet the terms of the Minsk agreements
[03:07.32]meant to end the conflict in Ukraine.
[03:12.44]Before the meeting, Trump had voiced support for Russia taking part.
[03:19.24]On Monday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced additional economic restrictions
[03:26.16]against five Russian groups and three individuals.

[03:38.08]and ties to Russian intelligence agencies.
[03:43.76]German Chancellor Angela Merkel told German public television
[03:49.04]that Trump's withdrawal from the communique was "sobering."
[03:54.04]And, French leader Emmanuel Macron
[03:58.20]criticized the president's refusal to sign the communique
[04:02.96]as harmful to international cooperation.
[04:08.44]Of the disagreements, U.S. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said,
[04:14.72]"There are always irritants in relationships."
[04:19.40]He said he believed relations among the allies
[04:23.60]would move forward on "a strong basis."
[04:28.92]The G7 communique called for members to work together
[04:34.20]to support a number of economic and social goals.
[04:39.76]It called for a commitment to a "rules-based international trading system"
[04:46.36]and called for members to continue to fight "protectionism."
[04:52.92]The statement also called for cooperation
[04:57.09]in supporting economic growth that helps everyone.
[05:03.44]In addition, the document called for preparing workers
[05:08.09]for future jobs and for gender equality.
