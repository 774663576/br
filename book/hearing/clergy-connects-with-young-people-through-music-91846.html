<p>In Portugal, about half of young people say they have no religion. Most participate less in services, have less confidence in the Church, and pray less than older generations, says a recent study by the Catholic Portuguese University in Braga.</p>

。
[00:00.04]Guilherme Peixoto,
[00:02.24]a religious official in northern Portugal,
[00:05.72]has been busy this month.
[00:08.00]He celebrated religious services,
[00:11.00]watched over remembrances for the dead,
[00:14.48]and prepared electronic music
[00:17.16]for his next international DJ performance.
[00:21.12]DJ, short for disc jockey,
[00:24.96]is a person who plays recorded music
[00:27.96]on the radio or at a gathering.
[00:31.32]For this 49-year-old Catholic priest,
[00:34.92]music has become an important way to reach people
[00:39.16]at a time when religion is becoming less popular
[00:43.20]— especially among young people.
[00:45.76]"With electronic music, I can take some message,
[00:50.16]I can be where young people are," Peixoto said recently.
[00:54.72]"They can think, ‘If it's possible for a priest to be DJ,
[01:00.04]it's possible for me to like music,
[01:02.68]and festivals, and be Christian.'"
[01:06.72]Peixoto became more well known
[01:09.20]when the organizers of World Youth Day in Lisbon
[01:13.64]asked him to "wake up the pilgrims" at 7 a.m.
[01:18.16]before Pope Francis' open-air Mass in August.
[01:23.04]When Peixoto was first sent to the village
[01:26.32]of Laúndos in the mid-2000s,
[01:29.56]the area needed money to pay
[01:32.12]for work done on the main church.
[01:34.96]But local people were tired of normal activities
[01:39.24]such as bake sales and door-knocking campaigns to raise money.
[01:44.60]So Peixoto called on the youth music groups
[01:48.36]to start karaoke events for support.
[01:51.64]Within a few years, debts were paid off,
[01:55.44]church repairs were completed,
[01:57.80]and Peixoto was taking professional DJ classes.
[02:01.80]"In the beginning it was strange, but now it's the norm.
[02:06.36]They understood the priest is also a person,"
[02:09.88]said Tania Campos,
[02:11.72]who was born and raised in Laúndos.
[02:14.88]Food and drink sales, as well as other donations,
[02:19.52]all go back to the church,
[02:21.84]which is readying for a big building project:
[02:25.40]a new center for youth activities.
[02:28.32]"This is why I'm happy to be here," said Andreia Flores,
[02:33.56]who belongs to Peixoto's second parish
[02:36.36]in the nearby village of Amorim.
[02:39.52]"Faith is to make others happy."
[02:42.76]For Peixoto, DJing has become an important way
[02:46.88]to spread religious messages.
[02:49.76]"I'm making these messages arrive
[02:52.24]where the church is not," he said of performances
[02:55.88]such as one at a recent Halloween festival
[02:59.36]with some 30,000 people.
[03:01.88]There, he re-mixed electronic dance beats
[03:06.12]with words from Pope Francis' statements
[03:09.20]about protecting the environment.
[03:11.96]Peixoto added with a laugh, "It's not so much
[03:16.00]— two-three sentences from the Pope
[03:18.68]— but if I wasn't there, it's no sentence.
[03:21.80]It's like a small seed,
[03:23.96]and the Holy Spirit will do his work."
[03:27.60]In fact, it was another document from Pope Francis,
[03:32.00]telling religious officials to go find "the lost sheep,"
[03:36.04]that pushed Peixoto to work harder on his music skills.
[03:41.28]The hope was that music
[03:43.28]could become a way to reach those
[03:45.76]who might never step inside a church.
[03:49.16]In Portugal, about half of young people
[03:53.00]say they have no religion.
[03:55.32]Most participate less in services,
[03:58.96]have less confidence in the Church,
[04:01.68]and pray less than older generations,
[04:05.08]says a recent study
[04:07.12]by the Catholic Portuguese University in Braga.
[04:11.84]Peixoto plans to continue to develop his DJ skills
[04:16.32]to bring a Christian message
[04:18.80]to people who might have never heard of Jesus
[04:22.44]— while remaining committed
[04:24.12]to all regular church activities.
[04:26.96]"It's very important to me to not only be the priest DJ,
[04:32.52]but be the shepherd of the community," Peixoto said recently.
