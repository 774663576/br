<p>Generations of stone carvers in Chimalhuacan also created much of the stonework found on buildings and parks in the capital's downtown.</p>
<p>While carvers in other areas long ago turned to mechanical devices, the workers here use only hammers and other special hand tools.</p>

。
[00:00.04]On most Sundays, the sound of hammers
[00:04.60]and other tools hitting stone can be heard
[00:08.48]in the burial area of ancient Xochiaca.
[00:13.44]It is a village in the Chimalhuacan area,
[00:17.32]on Mexico City's east side.
[00:20.44]The sounds come from stone carvers
[00:24.12]who still work on a craft
[00:26.32]that has been passed down for generations -
[00:29.96]even after the local source of stone was used up.
[00:34.96]The village burial area, or cemetery,
[00:39.64]is filled with meter-high statues of religious figures
[00:44.68]and other beautiful stone objects.
[00:47.76]Generations of stone carvers in Chimalhuacan
[00:52.44]also created much of the stonework
[00:55.68]found on buildings and parks in the capital's downtown.
[01:00.92]While carvers in other areas
[01:03.96]long ago turned to mechanical devices,
[01:07.76]the workers here use only hammers
[01:11.16]and other special hand tools.
[01:14.08]Many are self-taught, but some,
[01:17.72]like Tomás Ugarte, age 86,
[01:21.44]learned in the traditional way.
[01:24.28]This method of rock cutting
[01:26.96]has been passed down between family members,
[01:30.84]dating back about five generations.
[01:34.24]The rock cutters are generally older.
[01:37.76]There were about 600 official stone carvers about 10 years ago.
[01:44.72]Now, there are probably only around 300,
[01:49.20]said Carolina Montesinos Mendoza
[01:52.60]of the state office that supports traditional skills.
[01:57.40]The carvers are dying
[01:59.76]and their children generally do not want to take up the trade.
[02:04.92]Still, the stone carvers keep the old traditions alive.
[02:11.08]Many people in the area use stone mortars and pestles
[02:16.24]made by the stone carvers.
[02:18.80]Known as "molcajetes" in Spanish,
[02:23.00]these bowl-like objects are the basic tool for making salsas.
[02:28.44]Rev. Alberto Sandoval,
[02:31.44]who has known the stone workers since 1990,
[02:35.48]described them as "the backbone of the community."
[02:39.48]Most of the carvers have individual work areas at home,
[02:45.36]which provide them with some money.
[02:48.56]They sell carvings for prices ranging from $500 to $2,000.
[02:56.48]But the stone carvers often do not sell much.
[03:01.92]Unlike many craftspeople
[03:03.76]who want to see their works shown in museums,
[03:07.60]the carvers here work free of charge
[03:10.80]to create and maintain carvings for the local cemetery.
[03:15.68]They also work for free at decorating and repairing the stonework
[03:21.36]at the 250-year-old local church, Santa María de Guadalupe.
[03:29.20]One of the earliest signs of the stone carvers' work
[03:33.48]is a carved stone on the ground reading "Xochiaca,
[03:38.32]home of the stone carvers." It does not have a date.
[03:42.96]The writing talks about a time
[03:45.84]when the lake that once covered much of the valley
[03:49.36]still touched Xochiaca.
[03:51.96]Builders would come looking for carvings
[03:55.24]and ship them to Mexico City on ships over the lake.
[03:59.68]Juan Alfaro Bastidas, 75, is a carver,
[04:05.20]just as his father and grandfather were.
[04:08.72]He remembers going into the rock mines, or quarries,
[04:14.04]by candlelight to get blocks of stone.
[04:17.60]But the quarries are just a memory now.
[04:21.20]The land where the quarries stood was sold for housing developments.
[04:26.60]Now, the carvers truck in stone from other states

[04:33.68]but sometimes from as far away as the southern state of Yucatan.

[04:48.44]of 100 or 200 pesos ($6 to $12).
[04:54.64]The people of the town buy the stone," said Bastidas.
[04:59.36]Asked if the trade will survive,
[05:02.40]carver Mario Olivares read a poem written on the church wall:
[05:07.64]"Your art, your tradition, your culture
[05:10.84]and the nobility of the people keep the soul of this town alive."
