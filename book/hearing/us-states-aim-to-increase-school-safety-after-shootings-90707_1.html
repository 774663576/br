美国田纳西州一所小学最近发生枪击案，造成3名9岁儿童和3名成年人死亡。现在，全美各州立法机构正在推进旨在改善校园安全的法案。</p>
<p>The bills have been introduced in both liberal and conservative states. Some bills would require schools to put in place technology like panic alerts, security cameras and emergency communications systems.
这些法案在自由派和保守派掌权的各州都已经被提出。一些法案要求学校采用类似紧急报警、安全摄像头以及紧急通信系统等技术设备。</p>
<p>Lawmakers see the bills as a way to improve school security while avoiding the dispute over gun control. But some experts say teacher safety training is more effective and less costly than the new technologies.<br/>

民主党州议员呼吁制定更严格的枪支法，以防止校园枪击事件的发生。但是很多人现在也支持主要由共和党人推动的学校紧急措施。</p>
<p>In the northwestern state of Oregon, Democrats control the legislature. A bill there would require schools to send electronic warnings to parents as soon as possible after a safety threat.

They would contact police or other emergency services when used.<br/>
在西北部的俄勒冈州，民主党控制着立法机构。当地一项法案将要求学校在出现安全威胁后，尽快向家长发送电子警告。在所有议员的支持下，该法案在州众议院获得通过。两名民主党议员是另一项法案的作者，该法案要求所有公立学校教室都安装紧急报警装置。它们在使用时会联系警察或其它紧急服务部门。</p>
<p>If passed, the panic alert bill would make Oregon the fourth state to pass the law. Florida, New Jersey and New York have all passed it. Several other states are considering similar legislation.<br/>
如果该法案获得通过，俄勒冈州将成为第4个通过该法案的州。佛罗里达州、新泽西州和纽约州都通过了该法案。其它几个州也在考虑类似的法案。</p>
<p>Panic alert devices started being used more after the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.<br/>
2018年佛罗里达州帕克兰市一所高中发生大规模枪击案后，紧急报警装置开始被更多地使用。</p>
<p>Lori Alhadeff's 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was among the 17 killed. She started the group Make Our Schools Safe and began supporting panic devices. She had texted her daughter as shots were fired that help was on the way.<br/>
洛丽·阿尔哈德夫14岁的女儿艾莉莎是17名遇难者之一。她创办了“让我们学校安全”组织，并开始支持紧急报警装置。枪声响起时，她给女儿发了短信，说救援力量正在赶来。</p>

该组织发言人洛丽·基泰哥罗德斯基表示：“做好准备又不会有什么损失。”</p>

一些共和党领导的州已经批准为学校提供更多的资金，以帮助学校支付紧急按钮等新设备的费用。威尔·富勒顿表示，以“危机警报”产品为例，每所学校签订3到5年合同至少需要8千美元。他就职于Centegix公司，该公司生产了该产品。</p>
<p>After a shooter killed 19 children and two teachers last May at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, state officials announced $105 million for school safety and mental health programs.

去年，得克萨斯州乌瓦尔德市一所小学发生枪击案，造成19名儿童和两名教师遇难。之后，该州官员宣布为学校安全和心理健康项目提供了1.05亿美元资金。其中近一半用于学校警察的防弹保护。1700万美元用于学校购买紧急报警技术。</p>
<p>The Missouri House recently approved a 2024 budget with $50 million for school safety funds. That is on top of the $20 million already approved for school safety in the current year.

密苏里州众议院最近批准了一项2024年度预算，其中有5千万美元用于学校安全基金。除此之外，今年已经批准了2000万美元用于学校安全。学校将能够把这笔钱用于门锁设备、通信系统和视频监控设备等技术领域。</p>
<p>Ken Trump is the president of National School Safety and Security Services. The group advises schools on safety measures. He said lawmakers often make one-time purchases of new technology, but do not fund the technology over longer periods of time for things like repairs.<br/>
肯·特朗普是美国国家学校安全和安保服务局的主席。该组织就安全措施向学校提供建议。他说，议员们经常一次性购买新技术，但是不会在更长时间内为维修等事务提供技术资金。</p>
<p>"There's no budget to repair, replace and maintain them after they put them in," Trump said.<br/>
特朗普表示：“在设备安装后没有维修、更换和维护等预算。”</p>
<p>He said the tools are often not properly used. He added that schools should center on training teachers to identify and recognize dangerous situations and make thoughtful decisions under stress.<br/>
他说，这些工具经常使用不当。他补充说，学校应该围绕培训教师发现和识别危险情况，并在压力下做出深思熟虑的决定。</p>

。
[00:00.04]An elementary school shooting
[00:02.12]in the U.S. state of Tennessee
[00:04.72]recently left three 9-year-olds
[00:07.64]and three adults dead.
[00:10.28]Now, state legislatures across the country
[00:13.84]are moving forward with bills
[00:16.52]aiming to improve school safety.
[00:20.28]The bills have been introduced
[00:22.24]in both liberal and conservative states.
[00:25.60]Some bills would require schools
[00:28.32]to put in place technology like panic alerts,
[00:31.80]security cameras
[00:33.48]and emergency communications systems.
[00:37.80]Lawmakers see the bills
[00:40.24]as a way to improve school security
[00:43.64]while avoiding the dispute over gun control.
[00:47.88]But some experts say teacher safety training
[00:52.32]is more effective and less costly
[00:56.08]than the new technologies.
[00:59.48]Democratic state lawmakers
[01:01.88]have called for tighter gun laws
[01:04.24]to prevent school shootings.
[01:06.20]But many are now also supporting
[01:09.56]the school emergency measures
[01:11.60]that have largely been pushed by Republicans.
[01:16.00]In the northwestern state of Oregon,
[01:18.88]Democrats control the legislature.
[01:21.92]A bill there would require schools
[01:24.96]to send electronic warnings to parents
[01:27.92]as soon as possible after a safety threat.
[01:32.08]It passed the state House of Representatives
[01:35.44]with support from all lawmakers.
[01:38.52]Two Democratic lawmakers
[01:41.44]are the main writers of another bill
[01:44.52]that would require all public school classrooms
[01:48.28]to have panic alert devices.
[01:51.04]They would contact police
[01:53.44]or other emergency services when used.
[01:58.44]If passed, the panic alert bill
[02:01.16]would make Oregon the fourth state
[02:03.44]to pass the law.
[02:04.88]Florida, New Jersey and New York
[02:08.20]have all passed it.
[02:09.96]Several other states
[02:11.56]are considering similar legislation.
[02:16.04]Panic alert devices
[02:17.88]started being used more
[02:19.88]after the 2018 mass shooting
[02:22.60]at a high school in Parkland, Florida.
[02:26.72]Lori Alhadeff's 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa,
[02:30.36]was among the 17 killed.
[02:33.24]She started the group Make Our Schools Safe
[02:36.92]and began supporting panic devices.
[02:40.04]She had texted her daughter
[02:42.72]as shots were fired that help was on the way.
[02:47.48]"There's really nothing to lose
[02:49.28]by being prepared,"
[02:50.72]said Lori Kitaygorodsky,
[02:53.36]the group's spokesperson.
[02:56.96]Some Republican-led states
[02:59.40]have approved more money for school safety
[03:03.00]to help schools pay for new devices
[03:05.84]like panic buttons.
[03:07.32]CrisisAlert, for example,
[03:09.84]costs at least $8,000 per school
[03:13.68]for a three-to five-year contract,
[03:16.36]said Will Fullerton.
[03:18.20]He works for Centegix,
[03:20.76]the company that makes the product.
[03:24.32]After a shooter killed 19 children
[03:27.28]and two teachers last May
[03:29.76]at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas,
[03:33.24]state officials announced $105 million
[03:37.48]for school safety and mental health programs.
[03:41.88]Nearly half of that
[03:43.24]was given for bullet-resistant protection
[03:46.00]for school police.
[03:47.52]Seventeen million dollars was for school systems
[03:51.48]to purchase panic-alert technology.
[03:55.64]The Missouri House recently approved
[03:58.16]a 2024 budget
[04:00.20]with $50 million for school safety funds.
[04:04.04]That is on top of the $20 million
[04:07.60]already approved
[04:08.88]for school safety in the current year.
[04:11.84]Schools will be able
[04:13.96]to use the money on technology
[04:16.08]including door locking devices,
[04:18.44]communication systems
[04:20.52]and video surveillance equipment.
[04:24.76]Ken Trump is the president
[04:26.92]of National School Safety and Security Services.
[04:30.84]The group advises schools on safety measures.
[04:35.68]He said lawmakers often make
[04:38.12]one-time purchases of new technology,
[04:40.96]but do not fund the technology
[04:43.44]over longer periods of time
[04:45.56]for things like repairs.
[04:48.44]"There's no budget
[04:49.56]to repair, replace and maintain them
[04:52.68]after they put them in," Trump said.
[04:56.56]He said the tools are often not properly used.
[05:00.44]He added that schools
[05:02.72]should center on training teachers
[05:05.08]to identify and recognize
[05:08.00]dangerous situations
[05:09.76]and make thoughtful decisions under stress.
