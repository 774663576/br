。
[00:00.04]Researchers in Australia recently announced
[00:04.80]the launch of a new device that, they say,
[00:08.76]absorbs water from air to produce drinkable water.
[00:14.08]Researchers at the University of Newcastle
[00:18.32]call the device the Hydro Harvester.
[00:21.84]They said it can produce
[00:24.24]up to 1,000 liters of drinkable water a day,
[00:29.24]adding that it could be "lifesaving
[00:32.48]during drought or emergencies."
[00:35.44]The Australian team said that unlike
[00:38.96]other atmospheric water generators,
[00:42.24]their invention works by heating air
[00:45.36]instead of cooling it.
[00:47.48]The device absorbs water from the atmosphere.
[00:52.24]Solar energy or heat from other industrial processes
[00:57.84]can be used to produce hot, wet air.
[01:02.04]After heating, the air cools,
[01:05.52]producing water for drinking or watering crops.
[01:09.92]Behdad Moghtaderi of the University of Newcastle's
[01:15.44]Centre for Innovative Energy Technologies
[01:19.28]told VOA how the technology operates.
[01:23.56]"Hydro Harvester uses an absorbing material
[01:28.00]to absorb and dissolve moisture from air.
[01:32.24]So…we use renewable energy..." Moghtaderi said.
[01:37.72]He added, "When you condense water contained in that air
[01:43.24]you would have the drinking water at your disposal."
[01:48.12]The researchers say the device
[01:50.40]can produce enough drinking water each day
[01:53.72]for a small rural town of up to 400 people.
[01:58.56]It could also help farmers
[02:01.24]keep livestock alive during droughts.
[02:04.60]Moghtaderi said the technology could be used
[02:08.40]in parts of the world where water is limited.
[02:13.12]Researchers thought their device would be useful
[02:16.36]because Australia's climate is dry.
[02:19.96]"More than 2 billion people around the world,
[02:23.60]they are in a similar situation
[02:26.40]where they do not have access to…high-quality water
[02:30.68]and they deal with water scarcity," Moghtaderi said
[02:35.36]Studies of the technology will be done
[02:39.20]in several Australian communities this year.
[02:43.00]The World Economic Forum (WEF),
[02:48.00]a nonprofit group based in Switzerland,
[02:51.80]says water scarcity continues to be a problem worldwide.
[02:57.24]The WEF said getting water from the atmosphere
[03:02.28]is a "promising emergency solution
[03:05.52]that can immediately generate drinkable water
[03:09.28]using moisture in the air."
[03:12.56]However, the group warns that the technology is costly.
[03:18.40]It estimates that one mid-sized device
[03:22.28]could cost between $30,000 and $50,000.
