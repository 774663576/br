<p>His business partner, Keno Knieriem, said the details of a wave can be chosen on an electronic device. He said the electromechanical system would use devices that can create up to 1,000 waves per hour. And it can create swells similar to those in the ocean up to 2.4 meters high.</p>
<p>Knieriem said some 80 surfers could surf on different waves, like ones for kids or very large waves, at the same time.</p>
<p>Knieriem said the project would use water saving measures and its own electricity source. And it would use native plants around the center.</p>

[00:01.84]Brian Keaulana is a Native Hawaiian waterman
[00:06.00]famous for his understanding of the ocean.
