。
[00:00.04]"Leaf-peepers" are tourists who visit the countryside
[00:05.48]in the northeastern United States each autumn.
[00:10.92]"Peeper" means looker, someone who looks.
[00:16.44]The leaf-peepers travel to see 
[00:19.64]the seasonal changes to the trees.
[00:23.24]Their leaves turn color from green to deep red,
[00:27.96]bright yellow and rich orange
[00:31.32]before finally falling to the ground.
[00:36.16]Many leaf-peepers head to Vermont.
[00:39.80]They like to take photos of the trees,
[00:43.36]the hills, old farm buildings and houses in the state.
[00:49.92]They often stop their vehicles 
[00:52.72]on the side of the road to take pictures.
[00:57.16]The visitors are good for the local economy
[01:00.96]because they spend money on hotels,
[01:04.44]restaurants and other business.
[01:07.84]But, the flood of tourists can also cause problems
[01:13.52]in small, usually quiet country towns.
[01:18.60]They create too much vehicle traffic, 
[01:21.16]pollution and other trouble.
[01:24.84]One small town has taken surprising action
[01:28.84]to deal with the leaf-peepers.
[01:32.64]Pomfret, Vermont has closed roads to non-residents
[01:37.52]through the middle of October.
[01:41.08]Pomfret officials said the restrictions were carried out
[01:46.00]in reaction to what they called "poorly behaved tourists."
[01:51.16]Visitors often seek out Sleepy Hollow Farm in Promfret.
[01:57.80]They like to take pictures there.
[02:00.20]Police now are guarding the road from all but locals.
[02:07.64]The colorful hillside behind the farm
[02:10.56]is famous from the many images of it
[02:13.52]posted to social media services
[02:16.76]such as Facebook and Instagram.
[02:21.20]People who live in central Vermont
[02:24.20]say they understand
[02:26.48]how the land's beauty appeals to visitors.
[02:30.76]But they say the traffic slowdowns,
[02:34.20]blocked roads and bad behavior by visitors is a major problem.
[02:41.88]Nancy Bassett lives in the area.
[02:45.48]"It's just a shame," she said about the bad behavior,
[02:49.76]which includes some people
[02:52.00]trying to move beyond barriers to get better views.
[02:57.08]"It spoils it for a lot of people," Bassett added.
[03:01.88]Vermont is not the only pretty place
[03:05.00]that some argue has been ruined by social media.
[03:10.28]People have crowded into small streets in Paris
[03:14.68]and wilderness areas in California
[03:18.28]just to take a photo like the ones they see on Instagram.
[03:24.76]In the small city of Lake Elsinore, California,
[03:29.00]people stopped to take photos of a "superbloom"
[03:33.32]of wildflowers caused by a rainy winter in 2019.
[03:40.40]Locals said the visitors "trampled"
[03:44.04]the very flowers they came to photograph.
[03:48.08]In some places, such as the famous Zion National Park
[03:53.04]in the western state of Utah,
[03:55.40]visitors need a permit to enter some areas.
[04:00.88]The news of the Vermont closures
[04:03.44]prompted many to write about it on social media.
[04:07.52]One person asked: "Why in the world
[04:11.24]would you want to visit somewhere with a crowd of people?

[04:21.24]One road, Cloudland Road, is now closed to visitors.
