<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Facebook Now Rates Users on Trustworthiness]

。
[00:00.00]Facebook is now rating users on how trustworthy they are
[00:05.77]in identifying and reporting real and false news.
[00:12.56]The ratings system was first reported by The Washington Post.
[00:19.77]A Post reporter interviewed Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons,
[00:27.32]who leads the company's efforts to fight misinformation.
[00:32.60]Lyons told the newspaper the system
[00:36.75]was developed and put into place over the past year.
[00:41.71]In January, Facebook announced a similar system
[00:47.02]to produce ratings for the trustworthiness of news sources.
[00:53.00]At that time, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said those ratings
[01:00.08]would be based on information provided by Facebook users.
[01:05.72]Zuckerberg said news sources receiving higher trustworthy ratings
[01:12.09]from the community would be prioritized in the social media service's News Feed.
[01:19.30]The new ratings system is designed to predict
[01:24.06]how effective a user is at identifying and reporting false news stories.
[01:31.87]Every user is given a rating between zero and one, the Post reports.
[01:40.31]Lyons told the newspaper such a system is necessary
[01:45.97]because some users are incorrectly reporting whether a story is true or false.
[01:53.71]It's "not uncommon for people to tell us something is false simply
[02:01.02]because they disagree with the premise of a story
[02:04.49]or they're intentionally trying to target a particular publisher," Lyons said.
[02:12.62]As an example, she said a user's trustworthiness rating would go up
[02:19.33]if they previously reported a news story as false,
[02:24.06]and the story was later confirmed as false by an independent fact checker.
[02:31.37]In addition to information from users, Facebook
[02:36.44]uses machine learning systems to choose stories to be checked for truthfulness.
[02:43.70]The company has a partnership with several major news and fact-checking organizations
[02:50.81]that examine news stories reported as possibly being false.
[02:57.18]Lyons noted that the numbered rating is not the single measure
[03:03.74]Facebook uses to judge a user's overall trustworthiness.
[03:09.49]She said the company also uses other "signals" to rate users,
[03:15.36]but did not provide further details.
[03:19.13]In addition to taking steps to fight misinformation,
[03:24.53]Facebook has also sought to limit efforts
[03:28.56]by foreign organizations to influence the U.S. political process.
[03:33.99]Facebook previously found evidence that false accounts created in Russia
[03:40.44]and other nations were used to try to influence American voters in the 2016 election.
[03:48.93]On Tuesday, Facebook said it had identified
[03:53.27]and removed hundreds of accounts linked to Russia and Iran.
[03:59.12]It said the accounts were part of separate disinformation campaigns on Facebook.
[04:06.07]In announcing the findings, Facebook chief Zuckerberg said
[04:11.63]there was still a lot the company does not know about the operations.
[04:16.49]However, he described the campaigns as "sophisticated"
[04:21.79]and well-financed efforts that are likely to continue.
[04:26.94]"You're going to see people try to abuse the services in every way possible...
[04:33.08]including now nation states," Zuckerberg said.
[04:38.07]Spokesmen for both Iran and Russia denied any state
[04:44.81]involvement in the activities described by Facebook.
[04:49.33]This week, American software maker Microsoft reported 
[04:55.60]it had taken control of several websites created by hackers linked to Russia's government.
[05:02.70]The company said the websites were made to look like they belonged
[05:07.67]to the U.S. Senate and conservative research groups.
[05:12.05]But they were actually false websites created in an effort to gather personal details of users.
[05:20.75]Microsoft warned the hacking incidents were further evidence
[05:26.11]that Russia is expanding its attacks before U.S. congressional elections in November.
