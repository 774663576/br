美国卫生官员敦促老年人再接种一针更新版新冠疫苗。</p>

美国疾控预防中心最近发布了针对65岁及以上美国人的建议。</p>
<p>A statement by CDC Director Mandy Cohen explained the new guidance. "Most COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations last year were among people 65 years and older. An additional vaccine dose can provide added protection ... for those at highest risk."<br/>
美国疾控预防中心主任曼迪·科恩在一份声明中对这份新的指导意见做出了解释。“去年新冠肺炎死亡和住院患者多数都是65岁及以上人群。对这些高危人群来说，接种一剂加强针可以提供更多防护。</p>
<p>The CDC said an additional dose of the vaccine can provide increased protection, even if older adults received the updated shot version launched last autumn.<br/>

<p>The new guidance suggests individuals who did receive the updated shot – which became available last September – should wait at least four months before getting the latest dose.<br/>
新的指导意见建议，接种了去年9月推出的更新疫苗的人群，应该至少等待四个月才能接种最新的疫苗。</p>
<p>The CDC's decision, or recommendation, came after much debate over whether to say older people "may" get the shots or "should" do so. That discussion demonstrates the ongoing debate among experts about how necessary additional COVID-19 shots are.<br/>

一些医生表示，他们认为大多数老年人在去年秋天接种疫苗后得到了有效的保护。研究表明，这些疫苗的有效期为六个月。</p>

<p>COVID-19 can still present serious health risks, especially to older people and those with existing medical conditions.

新冠肺炎仍可能带来严重的健康风险，尤其是对老年人和既有病患。美国疾控预防中心表示，新冠肺炎每周仍然导致2万多人住院，2000多人死亡。65岁及以上人群的住院率和死亡率最高。</p>
<p>Some members of the CDC group that approved the latest advice said the word "should" in the guidance is meant to persuade more doctors and drug stores to offer the shots.<br/>
美国疾控预防中心批准这一最新建议的小组的一些成员表示，指南中的“应该”一词旨在说服更多的医生和药店提供疫苗。</p>

<p>The CDC recommended that vaccine version for everyone 6 months and older. It also urged people with weak immune systems to get a second shot up to two months after the first.<br/>
美国疾控预防中心建议6个月及以上人群接种该疫苗。它还敦促免疫系统较弱人群在接种第一针后两个月内接种第二针。</p>
<p>But most Americans did not listen to that advice. The latest CDC data shows that 13 percent of U.S. children got the shots, while 22 percent of U.S. adults did. The vaccination rate for adults 65 and older is higher, at nearly 42 percent.<br/>
但大多数美国人没有听从这个建议。美国疾控预防中心的最新数据显示，接种了这剂疫苗的美国儿童为13%，而美国成年人为22%。65岁及以上人群的疫苗接种率更高，接近42%。</p>
<p>"People are tired of getting all these shots all the time," Dr. David Canaday told the AP. He is an infectious diseases expert at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.<br/>
大卫·卡纳迪博士告诉美联社：“人们已经厌倦了一直接种这些疫苗。”他是俄亥俄州克利夫兰市凯斯西储大学的传染病专家。</p>
<p>Canaday, who does not serve on the CDC's advisory group, added, "We have to be careful about over-recommending the vaccine."<br/>
卡纳迪不在美国疾控预防中心的咨询小组任职，他补充道，“我们必须对过度推荐疫苗保持谨慎。”</p>

<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:US Health Officials Urge Older Adults to Get Latest COVID-19 Vaccine]

。
[00:00.04]U.S. health officials are urging older adults
[00:04.52]to get an additional updated COVID-19 vaccine shot.
[00:10.68]The advice for Americans 65 and older
[00:15.32]was recently issued by the U.S. Centers
[00:18.92]for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
[00:23.72]A statement by CDC Director Mandy Cohen
[00:28.56]explained the new guidance.
[00:31.32]"Most COVID-19 deaths
[00:33.84]and hospitalizations last year
[00:37.28]were among people 65 years and older.
[00:40.84]An additional vaccine dose
[00:43.48]can provide added protection
[00:46.00]... for those at highest risk."
[00:49.04]The CDC said an additional dose of the vaccine
[00:54.12]can provide increased protection,
[00:57.20]even if older adults received
[00:59.76]the updated shot version launched last autumn.
[01:04.40]The new guidance suggests individuals
[01:08.64]who did receive the updated shot
[01:11.72]– which became available last September
[01:15.00]– should wait at least four months
[01:17.28]before getting the latest dose.
[01:20.08]The CDC's decision, or recommendation,
[01:24.16]came after much debate over whether to say
[01:28.28]older people "may" get the shots
[01:31.24]or "should" do so.
[01:33.40]That discussion demonstrates the ongoing debate
[01:38.48]among experts about
[01:40.68]how necessary additional COVID-19 shots are.
[01:45.88]Some doctors have said they think
[01:48.88]most older adults are effectively protected
[01:53.04]after getting the shot last autumn.
[01:55.76]And studies have suggested the shots
[01:59.00]stay effective for six months.
[02:02.12]But health officials have noted
[02:05.12]the body's vaccine-activated defenses
[02:08.88]can decrease over time,
[02:11.56]especially in older people.
[02:14.16]The CDC had recommended
[02:17.04]additional COVID-19 shots, called boosters,
[02:21.64]for older adults in 2022 and 2023.
[02:27.32]COVID-19 can still present serious health risks,
[02:32.72]especially to older people
[02:34.96]and those with existing medical conditions.
[02:38.80]The CDC says there are
[02:41.88]still more than 20,000 hospitalizations
[02:45.72]and more than 2,000 deaths
[02:48.32]each week from COVID-19.
[02:51.64]Individuals 65 years and older
[02:55.84]have the highest hospitalization and death rates.
[03:00.52]Some members of the CDC group
[03:03.76]that approved the latest advice
[03:06.32]said the word "should" in the guidance
[03:09.48]is meant to persuade more doctors
[03:12.76]and drug stores to offer the shots.
[03:16.48]"Most people are coming in
[03:19.20]either wanting the vaccine or not,"
[03:22.16]Dr. Jamie Loehr told The Associated Press.
[03:26.12]He is a member of the CDC's deciding committee
[03:30.76]and a family doctor in Ithaca, New York.
[03:34.56]"I am trying to make it easier
[03:37.36]for providers to say, ‘Yes, we recommend this.'"
[03:41.96]In September, the government
[03:44.56]ordered a new COVID-19 shot
[03:47.40]based on a version of the virus called XBB.1.5.
[03:53.32]That single-target vaccine replaced combinations
[03:58.20]that had targeted both the first COVID-19 version
[04:02.72]and a much earlier Omicron version.
[04:06.52]The CDC recommended that vaccine version
[04:11.08]for everyone 6 months and older.
[04:14.04]It also urged people with weak immune systems
[04:18.36]to get a second shot up to two months after the first.
[04:23.36]But most Americans did not listen to that advice.
[04:27.64]The latest CDC data shows
[04:30.92]that 13 percent of U.S. children got the shots,
[04:35.24]while 22 percent of U.S. adults did.
[04:39.16]The vaccination rate for adults 65 and older
[04:44.12]is higher, at nearly 42 percent.
[04:47.92]"People are tired of getting
[04:50.52]all these shots all the time,"
[04:53.28]Dr. David Canaday told the AP.
[04:57.20]He is an infectious diseases expert
[05:01.20]at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.
[05:06.36]Canaday, who does not serve
[05:09.08]on the CDC's advisory group,
[05:11.68]added, "We have to be careful about
[05:14.88]over-recommending the vaccine."
