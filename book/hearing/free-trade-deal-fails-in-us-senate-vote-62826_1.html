[ar:Jonathan Evans]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]A proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal 
[00:04.22]has failed in its first major test in the United States Congress. 
[00:09.63]The Senate voted Tuesday against consideration of Trade Promotion Authority, 
[00:16.54]also known as "fast-track" authority. 
[00:20.00]TPA would protect trade agreements with other countries 
[00:24.60]against U.S. congressional interference. 
[00:28.02]Instead, lawmakers could vote only for or against the agreement.
[00:34.68]The Senate vote was 52 to 45. 
[00:38.44]It fell short of the three-fifths support needed 
[00:42.69]to begin debate on "fast-track" authority. 
[00:46.28]Most Democratic Party members voted to block debate of the bill. 
[00:52.18]They say the bill does not deal with trade enforcement 
[00:56.64]and reported Chinese efforts to influence the value of China's money. 
[01:01.65]They also say it fails to meet the needs of displaced American workers.
[01:07.23]Senator Charles Schumer is a New York Democrat. 
[01:11.60]He says Congress needs to help American citizens 
[01:15.74]at a time of increased international competition.
[01:19.23]"We know the global economy is a rough sea. 
[01:22.12]And Republicans are asking us to pass a trade package 
[01:25.91]that forces the American worker to navigate those waters in a leaky boat. 
[01:31.17]We want to plug up those leaks."
[01:33.09]Republican Mitch McConnell is the Senate's majority leader. 
[01:37.58]He expressed dissatisfaction with the results of the vote. 
[01:42.26]He noted that both Republicans and Democrats supported TPA 
[01:48.30]in a Senate Finance Committee vote last month.
[01:52.00]"There are always limits to what can be accomplished 
[01:55.58]when the American people choose divided government," he said. 
[01:59.37]"But ... it does not mean that" 
[02:01.74]Congress should not work toward solutions that satisfy both parties.
[02:06.89]Republican free-trade supporters hope to hold another vote on the issue. 
[02:12.06]They said concerns of the bill's opponents 
[02:15.57]can be discussed once debate begins again.
[02:19.31]Senator Orrin Hatch is a Republican from Utah 
[02:23.29]and supporter of "fast-track" authority.
[02:26.94]"We're doing our very best to try 
[02:29.53]and do what the (Obama) administration has wanted in this matter. 
[02:34.15]They are right on it... 
[02:35.16]Ninety-five percent of world trade is outside of our country. 
[02:38.89]I might add that the average wages go up 13 to 18 percent 
[02:44.96]through a trade agreement like this."
[02:47.55]At issue is the ability to finalize a free trade agreement 
[02:52.29]between 12 Pacific Rim nations. 
[02:55.14]Those 12 are responsible for 40 percent of the world's economic production. 
[03:01.30]Five of the countries are in Asia. 
[03:04.29]They are Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. 
[03:10.52]The others are Australia, Canada, Chile, 
[03:14.92]Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and the United States.
[03:19.94]The effect of trade on American jobs 
[03:23.08]makes the issue a difficult one for U.S. lawmakers. 
[03:27.17]The vote on Tuesday was far from the end of debate in Congress. 
[03:32.94]Most free-trade Senate Democrats say 
[03:36.33]they hope to reach an agreement with the Republicans. 
[03:39.59]They hope this will lead to a debate on TPA 
[03:43.62]and the trade agreements it could help shape in the future.
