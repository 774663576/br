。
[00:00.04]A new report says the spreading coronavirus could make the world economy shrink during the first three months of 2020.
[00:14.12]If confirmed, it would be the first quarterly drop in economic activity since the international financial crisis more than 10 years ago.
[00:28.48]The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released a special report on the effect of the virus Monday.
[00:41.96]The Paris-based OECD advises developed economies on policy.
[00:51.52]The report said the world economy is still expected to grow both this year and next year.
[01:00.00]But the OECD lowered its estimate for international growth in 2020 by half a percentage point, to 2.4 percent.
[01:15.64]It said the growth rate could go as low as 1.5 percent if the virus lasts long and spreads widely.
[01:27.52]The new coronavirus has caused more than 3,000 deaths worldwide.
[01:33.80]In addition to the "human suffering" from the virus, the report said that "economic prospects remain...very uncertain."
[01:45.64]The last time the world economy shrank on a quarter-on-quarter basis was at the end of 2008.
[01:55.00]At that time, a shock to financial businesses caused problems for companies around the world.
[02:02.76]Many people lost their jobs.
[02:05.60]The world economy continued to shrink through 2009.
[02:12.76]The OECD said China's reduced production is not only hurting Asia, but also companies that depend on Chinese goods.
[02:24.96]The report urged governments to act quickly to prevent contagion and bring back people's confidence in economic conditions.
[02:36.88]It also said that the effect of this virus is much greater than past outbreaks because the world's economy is "more interconnected."
[02:48.28]China, it added, has a lot more effect on trade, financial markets and tourism.
[02:57.20]China's viral outbreak has already caused problems for international supply chains.
[03:04.64]Chinese manufacturing fell in February as anti-virus controls had an effect on the world's second largest economy.
[03:16.32]Chinese factory activity fell to its lowest rate and to its lowest level on record.
[03:24.96]That information is based on studies by a business magazine, a government agency and an industry group.
[03:35.28]Chinese factories supply the products and parts for most of the world's smartphones, household goods and other products.
[03:45.84]In China, sales of houses, cars and other big purchases fell in recent weeks.
[03:53.80]China has tried to calm investors, industries and workers.
[03:59.52]The government has cut tax rates and offered aid to businesses.
[04:05.60]Economists, however, are worrying about the future.
[04:09.80]If the virus spreads, people will stop traveling, eating at restaurants, and going to stores.
[04:18.32]There may be large quarantines.
[04:23.16]Thierry Breton works for the European Union and oversees the EU's markets.
[04:30.40]He estimated Monday that the virus has cost Europe 2 billion euros this year because of a decrease in tourism from China.
[04:41.84]Many expect the situation in Europe will worsen.
[04:46.16]The virus has struck Italy, and events like the yearly Venice Carnival have been cancelled.
[04:54.92]Investors seem to expect central banks to lower interest rates to help the economy.
[05:02.44]Experts, however, say that will not solve the problem.
[05:07.96]Lower rates can help people and businesses borrow and spend money.
[05:13.16]That can help push up economic activity.
[05:17.76]But lower rates cannot make sick people healthy.
[05:21.72]It also cannot reopen factories whose workers are kept home because of quarantines
[05:29.16]or restart supply chains in areas affected by the outbreak.
