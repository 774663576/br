。
[00:00.04]A group of health experts recently announced
[00:04.92]that a new gene editing treatment
[00:07.92]for sickle cell disease was safe for patients.
[00:13.20]The treatment could provide a new cure
[00:17.64]that attacks the disease at its genetic source.
[00:22.92]Sickle cell disease (SCD)
[00:26.12]is a genetic blood disorder
[00:28.76]that affects millions of people worldwide.
[00:33.28]The disease is common in places with high cases of malaria,
[00:38.96]like Africa and India.
[00:42.92]It strikes among Black Americans,
[00:45.84]Africans, and Middle Easterners
[00:49.16]more than other groups.
[00:52.04]Scientists believe being a carrier of SCD
[00:57.44]helps protect against severe malaria.
[01:02.40]People with SCD carry unhealthy blood cells
[01:07.40]that result in blockages, called blood clots.
[01:12.24]This can cause pain
[01:14.68]and damage bones and organs in the human body.
[01:20.28]The World Health Organization said many children
[01:24.76]with the most severe form of the disease
[01:28.08]die before the age of five,
[01:31.12]usually from an infection or severe blood loss.
[01:37.32]Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics
[01:41.80]make the new treatment, called "exa-cel."
[01:46.96]The treatment involves permanently changing
[01:50.76]the genetic material, DNA,
[01:53.60]in a patient's blood cells.
[01:57.12]The goal is to help the body
[01:59.68]return to healthy blood cell production.
[02:04.00]Healthy blood cells are present at birth
[02:07.52]but abnormal cells begin to develop
[02:10.72]in people with sickle cell disease.
[02:14.60]When patients receive the treatment,
[02:17.36]stem cells are removed from their blood
[02:20.56]and the gene-editing tool
[02:23.60]CRISPR is used to remove the switching gene.
[02:28.88]Patients get medicines to kill off
[02:32.12]other damaged blood-producing cells
[02:35.52]and then are given back their changed stem cells.
[02:41.48]Vertex reported 46 people got the treatment in its study.
[02:47.36]Among 30 of them
[02:49.68]who had at least 18 months of observation,
[02:54.00]29 were free of pain crises for at least a year.
[03:00.52]All 30, Vertex reported,
[03:03.88]avoided being hospitalized for pain crises for that long.
[03:10.48]Victoria Gray, of Mississippi,
[03:13.48]was the first patient to test the "exa-cel" treatment.
[03:19.36]Gray told researchers at a scientific gathering earlier this year
[03:25.36]that she had suffered from pain since childhood.
[03:30.80]She described feeling "reborn"
[03:33.76]the day she got the treatment.
[03:35.92]"My children no longer have a fear
[03:40.00]of losing their mom to sickle cell disease," she said.
[03:45.84]The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[03:50.52]had already found the treatment effective
[03:54.24]in a study of SCD patients.
[03:57.56]The health agency, however,
[04:00.60]was not sure if the small genetic sample size
[04:05.16]used in the study captured the entire U.S. population
[04:10.16]for sickle cell disease.
[04:13.44]With the experts' findings,
[04:15.88]the FDA is likely to approve the treatment
[04:20.44]in early December for patients age 12 and older.
[04:25.80]If the treatment is approved,
[04:28.92]Vertex has also proposed
[04:31.64]to follow up with patients to study its safety
[04:36.36]for another 15 years.
[04:39.36]Vertex has not said how much the treatment will cost.
[04:44.92]But the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review
[04:50.12]estimates the cost could be around
[04:53.12]$2 million for the treatment.
[04:56.20]By comparison, research earlier this year
[05:01.20]showed medical costs for sickle cell treatments,
[05:05.44]from birth to age 65,
[05:08.44]could add up to $1.7 million.
[05:13.32]Dr. Allison King of Washington University
[05:17.28]School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri
[05:20.96]cares for children and young adults with sickle cell disease.
[05:26.24]She told the Associated Press
[05:29.64]that the new treatments would be costly.
[05:33.04]"But if you think about it," she said,
[05:36.56]"how much is it worth for someone to feel better
[05:40.56]and not be in pain
[05:42.36]and not be in the hospital all the time?"
