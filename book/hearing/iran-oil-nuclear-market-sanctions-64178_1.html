[ar:Caty Weaver]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]American businesses have begun to explore 
[00:03.59]how they can sell their goods and services in Iran. 
[00:08.43]For many years, restrictions on trade have stopped many companies 
[00:15.06]from doing business in the country. 
[00:17.45]The United States government was a major supporter of economic sanctions against Iran. 
[00:25.68]The sanctions were meant to punish Iran 
[00:29.86]for ignoring United Nations resolutions on its nuclear activities.
[00:35.35]But those restrictions may soon change. 
[00:40.09]This month, Iran signed an agreement with world powers to limit its nuclear program. 
[00:48.06]The deal calls for the international community to lift the sanctions.
[00:53.65]The agreement sets limits on Iran's nuclear development for 10 years. 
[01:00.27]In exchange, the international community will end sanctions and trade limits, 
[01:06.70]which have hurt Iran's economy. 
[01:09.13]But experts say Iran has much to do before foreign businesses invest 
[01:16.48]in the country and sell their products there.
[01:19.57]Suzanne Dimaggio is director of the Iran Initiative at New America, 
[01:25.64]a public policy group. 
[01:27.75]She says the country has 80 million highly-educated consumers 
[01:34.27]who want to buy products and services from U.S. companies. 
[01:39.36]But she says it will take some time for large American companies to, 
[01:46.03]in her words, "feel comfortable enough to start investing in Iran."
[01:51.96]"They'll need to see that Iran is working through this agreement, 
[01:57.00]is complying with it. 
[01:58.09]They also will want to see that there is some stability there."
[02:03.23]Iran has some of the largest oil and natural gas reserves in the world. 
[02:09.32]But economic sanctions have limited the country's ability to fully-develop those reserves.
[02:17.34]"But make no mistake about it, Iran will be a major player in the oil sector. 
[02:22.83]I think this has other countries like Saudi Arabia worried -- 
[02:27.43]what will that do to the market that is already so far down."
[02:30.80]Paul Wachtel teaches economics at New York University. 
[02:35.66]He notes that the sanctions will not be cancelled immediately. 
[02:40.62]But he says when they are, the global economy will benefit.
[02:46.18]"It will be good for world trade generally. 
[02:49.76]It would be good for many American industries, 
[02:52.49]consumer goods, producer's goods, airplane industry, 
[02:56.56]oil equipment, lots of American industry."
