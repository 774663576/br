。
[00:00.04]Britain will expel 23 Russian diplomats in answer to a chemical attack
[00:07.08]on a Russian double agent and his daughter in the city of Salisbury, England.
[00:13.96]Prime Minister Theresa May announced the expulsion decision Wednesday.
[00:20.80]May said the attack was an unlawful use of force by Russia against Britain.
[00:28.88]She also said Britain would suspend high-level talks with the Russian Federation
[00:37.64]and withdraw an invitation to the Russian foreign minister to visit the country.
[00:44.84]And, she said, no government ministers or members of the British royal family
[00:52.16]would attend World Cup games this summer in Russia.
[00:57.36]These and other measures are designed to strengthen British defenses
[01:03.44]against a hostile state, May said.
[01:07.42]Russian officials have denied that Russia was involved in the chemical attack.
[01:14.08]A spokesperson called Britain's actions "unacceptable, unjustified, and shortsighted."
[01:22.72]The spokesperson warned Britain to expect the Russian government
[01:27.75]to answer with measures of its own.
[01:33.12]Britain's restrictions against Russia come after an attack earlier this month
[01:39.28]on Sergei Skripal, age 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia.
[01:47.28]Sergei Skripal is a former Russian military intelligence official.
[01:53.80]In the 1990s, he secretly told the British government about Russian spies working in Europe.
[02:02.20]In 2004, Russia charged Skripal with treason and put him in jail.
[02:08.72]But he was freed in a spy exchange deal in 2010.
[02:14.52]Skripal settled in Britain. His daughter was visiting him there.
[02:19.72]On March 4, the Skripals were found at a shopping center
[02:25.76]in the southern English city of Salisbury.
[02:29.76]They could not be woken.
[02:32.08]The father and daughter were taken to the hospital.
[02:35.88]They remain there in serious condition.
[02:40.08]A police officer was also harmed in the attack.
[02:44.60]He is also in the hospital in serious condition.
[02:49.02]May has said the Skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent Russia developed in the 1980s.
[02:58.04]The chemical was designed to be used in bombs during military operations.
[03:05.56]The prime minister asked Russian officials
[03:08.84]to explain if they were responsible for the attack,
[03:12.68]or if they had lost control of the poison.
[03:17.00]But, May said, Russian officials did not take her question seriously.
[03:24.00]May said the 23 expelled Russian diplomats must leave Britain within one week.
[03:32.36]And, she said, British officials will closely watch for travelers to Britain who might be a threat.
[03:42.60]May also spoke about taking action against "serious criminals and corrupt elites."
[03:52.16]said, "There is no place for these people, or their money, in our country."
