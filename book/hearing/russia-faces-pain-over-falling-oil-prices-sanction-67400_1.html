[00:00.40]From VOA Learning English,
[00:03.16]this is the Economics Report.
[00:06.92]Russia's economy is struggling at the beginning of 2016.
[00:12.00]Low oil prices and Western sanctions against Russia
[00:17.08]continue to affect the country's economy.
[00:21.52]Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev
[00:24.24]thinks the economy is looking better than one year ago.
[00:29.24]But he told a conference this week
[00:31.84]that Russia must prepare for the worst-case scenario.
[00:36.84]In such a case, conditions would worsen, not improve.
[00:42.28]Medvedev spoke in Moscow at the yearly Gaidar Forum on economics.
[00:49.92]He noted that 2015 was probably the most difficult year
[00:55.40]for Russia economically in the past 10 years.
[00:59.72]The level of economic activity shrank 3.8 percent last year.
[01:07.16]Two main reasons for this were the sharp drop in the price of oil
[01:12.20]and Western economic sanctions.
[01:15.44]Oil is Russia's main export.
[01:18.72]Its price has dropped about 70 percent
[01:22.56]to $30 a barrel over the past 12 months.
[01:28.28]Western countries placed sanctions on Russia
[01:31.92]because of its 2014 takeover of Crimea.
[01:36.96]Russia also has continued its military support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.
[01:46.04]The western measures have cut off Russian banks from international credit.
[01:51.80]The value of the ruble has dropped from 30 to the U.S. dollar to about 75.
[02:00.60]Inflation was a major concern for Russians last year.
[02:05.32]On average, prices increased at a rate of 15 percent in 2015.
[02:12.56]Yet consumer food prices increased between 20 and 30 percent.
[02:19.20]High inflation for staple products has hurt Russia's poor.
[02:24.52]The number of Russians below subsistence poverty
[02:28.96]rose to more than 20 million last year from 18 million a year earlier.
[02:37.64]Prime Minister Medvedev said the result of inflation was a fall in real incomes.
[02:45.32]"Many people have become poorer," he said.
[02:48.64]"And, the middle class has suffered.
[02:51.00]And, this is probably one of the most painful aftereffects of the last years."
[02:58.72]Government officials have said they expect the economy to improve this year.
[03:05.08]They predict that inflation will drop below 10 percent in February.
[03:12.08]Medvedev praised his government's plan for reducing shocks from overseas.
[03:18.48]He added that the economy was not in tatters.
[03:24.68]"Russia is in (the) top 10 countries
[03:27.84]with the lowest public debt and greatest foreign exchange reserves.
[03:34.08]And, that really provides for the resilience of our financial system," he said.
[03:40.76]The prime minister admitted the federal government would likely face budget cuts.
[03:47.04]About half of Russia's budget depends on oil export revenues.
[03:53.76]Russia's 2016 budget was made in October,
[03:57.60]when oil was selling for $50 a barrel.
[04:01.92]Many observers say the more likely price is between $30 and $40,
[04:09.08]and could even drop below $20.
[04:14.48]And that's the Economics Report.
