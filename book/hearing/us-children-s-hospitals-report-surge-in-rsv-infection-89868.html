。
[00:00.04]Children's hospitals in parts of the United States
[00:04.04]are reporting a worrying surge in respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
[00:12.60]The common virus affects the breathing system,
[00:16.32]usually causing minor sickness like a runny nose and cough.
[00:22.12]But RSV infections can cause
[00:25.48]much more serious disease in babies and old people.
[00:30.80]RSV cases dropped sharply two years ago
[00:34.64]when the pandemic led to shutdowns of most public activity.
[00:40.04]But with restrictions easing in the summer of 2021,
[00:45.44]doctors saw a concerning increase in RSV infections.
[00:51.04]The disease usually spreads in the autumn and winter seasons.
[00:57.16]Doctors are preparing for the possibility
[01:00.44]that RSV, flu and COVID-19
[01:04.56]may all surge in the coming months.
[01:07.88]Experts worry that such an event
[01:11.36]could cause greater medical demand than hospitals can meet.
[01:17.48]"I'm calling it an emergency,"
[01:19.92]said Dr. Juan Salazar of Connecticut's Children's Hospital.
[01:25.88]There, RSV has forced led the hospital
[01:29.36]to repurpose some spaces in the building as patient rooms.
[01:34.32]Most people infected with RSV
[01:37.76]can pass the virus over a three to eight day period.
[01:42.44]But, babies and people with weakened immune systems
[01:46.44]can spread RSV for up to four weeks.
[01:50.80]There is no vaccine for it, though several candidates are in testing.
[01:57.16]RSV can infect anyone.
[02:00.16]But it causes the most threat to babies,
[02:04.00]older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
[02:08.40]These groups are at greater risk of developing
[02:12.80]serious lung infections from RSV.
[02:17.12]Around 58,000 Americans under the age of five
[02:22.00]require hospital treatment for RSV in a usual year.
[02:27.16]The disease also kills as many
[02:30.44]as 500 children under five in the U.S. ever year.
[02:36.48]For adults 65 and older,
[02:39.52]RSV causes 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths yearly.
[02:49.60]For babies, the struggle to breathe can interfere with eating.
[02:55.36]Experts are suggesting several reasons for the current RSV surge.
[03:01.36]They note that babies and children were less exposed
[03:06.24]to RSV and other common diseases
[03:09.36]during the pandemic lockdowns.
[03:11.68]Now that restrictions have ended,
[03:14.88]children face higher chances of contact with RSV.
[03:19.76]Also, experts say immune systems
[03:23.56]might not be as prepared to fight the virus
[03:27.16]after more than two years of masking,
[03:30.84]said Dr. Elizabeth Mack.
[03:33.20]She is with the Medical University of South Carolina.
[03:38.16]Last week, tests identified RSV infections
[03:42.20]in more than 7,000 people, said the Centers
[03:46.24]for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
[03:49.88]That is more than in past outbreaks.
[03:53.32]There is no cure for RSV.
[03:56.20]Doctors may provide a steroid medicine
[03:59.44]or an inhaler to patients to ease their breathing.
[04:04.24]In serious cases, patients can require oxygen assistance,
[04:09.48]a breathing tube or a ventilator.
[04:13.64]To prevent the spread of viruses,
[04:16.08]people should wash their hands and stay home if feeling sick.
[04:22.12]During RSV season, an injection of an antibody-based medicine
[04:27.92]is sometimes given to protect babies at very high risk.
