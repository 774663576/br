[00:01.00]Researchers recently announced
[00:03.92]that they have found qualities
[00:06.32]of the main black hole in our Milky Way Galaxy
[00:10.44]that they did not know about before.
[00:14.04]Black holes are very massive objects with gravity so strong
[00:19.28]that even light cannot escape them.
[00:22.48]The space scientists said they found
[00:25.84]a strong and organized magnetic field
[00:29.20]around the black hole called Sagittarius A*.
[00:34.64]It is at the center of our galaxy 26,000 light years away.
[00:41.48]Activity at the edge of the black hole
[00:45.04]is believed to have created the magnetic field.
[00:49.52]It is similar to activity
[00:51.76]surrounding the only other black hole ever imaged.
[00:56.04]That one is at the center
[00:58.88]of a nearby galaxy commonly called M87.
[01:04.12]The researchers wondered if their finding suggests
[01:07.96]that strong magnetic fields
[01:10.80]might be a quality common to all black holes.
[01:15.36]The magnetic field around
[01:18.00]the M87 black hole, called M87*,
[01:23.20]causes it to launch powerful jets
[01:26.28]of material into space, the researchers said.
[01:30.40]They added that while such jets
[01:33.64]have not yet been found near Sagittarius A*,
[01:38.28]they might exist and might be observable in the near future.
[01:44.56]The researchers released the image
[01:47.24]showing the environment around Sagittarius A*
[01:51.80]in polarized light for the first time.
[01:55.56]In a way, light behaves like a wave.
[01:59.44]Light waves can move in different directions.
[02:03.84]When light waves are restricted to one direction,
[02:08.08]or plane, the result is polarized light.
[02:13.28]The latest image came from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
[02:19.68]It is an international network of observatories
[02:23.88]working together to study radio waves
[02:27.32]connected with black holes.
[02:29.88]The EHT also provided the earlier image
[02:34.56]of the M87 black hole.
[02:37.80]Sara Issaoun is with the Center for Astrophysics -
[02:42.64]Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.
[02:44.88]Issaoun said scientists can "see" black holes:
[02:49.72]"By imaging polarized light
[02:52.28]from hot glowing gas near black holes,
[02:55.80]we are directly inferring the structure and strength
[02:59.56]of the magnetic fields..."
[03:02.28]She said observing polarized light made the new study different:
[03:07.96]"Compared to the previous results,
[03:10.92]polarized light teaches us a lot more about the astrophysics,
[03:16.40]the properties of the gas,
[03:18.52]and mechanisms that take place as a black hole feeds."
[03:23.32]A co-leader of the research, Issaoun said:
[03:27.28]"For a while, we've believed that magnetic fields
[03:30.56]play a key role in how black holes feed
[03:34.20]and eject matter in powerful jets."
[03:37.64]"This new image...shows that strong and ordered magnetic fields
[03:43.00]are critical to how black holes interact
[03:46.12]with the gas and matter around them."
[03:48.88]Angelo Ricarte is another researcher from the Center
[03:53.92]for Astrophysics who was involved with the study.
[03:57.80]Ricarte said: "The magnetic field appears to be organized
[04:02.96]into a spiral, similar to M87*.
[04:07.48]This magnetic field geometry implies that the black hole
[04:12.88]can power very efficient jets
[04:15.52]that shoot off into the galaxy,"
[04:18.04]The M87 black hole has a mass
[04:21.68]6 billion times that of our sun —
[04:24.80]much bigger than the one in our Milky Way.
[04:28.04]It ejects a powerful jet
[04:31.20]visible in all wavelengths of light.
[04:34.92]The evidence for a jet
[04:37.20]flowing from Sagittarius A* is growing.
[04:41.80]Ricarte said that researchers
[04:44.36]are hopeful about the prediction
[04:46.96]for a powerful jet in the Milky Way's black hole.
[04:51.48]As tools get better in the coming years, he said,
[04:55.36]researchers should be able to better
[04:57.80]understand the issue from the data.
[05:00.64]The researchers' findings
[05:02.96]appeared recently in Astrophysical Journal Letters.
