。
[00:00.04]Alessandra Zarelli works to keep the artwork
[00:04.56]of the Vatican Museums in good condition.
[00:09.92]She says, whenever she works on a masterpiece,
[00:14.24]she must calm her heart
[00:16.80]so her thinking can center on her work.
[00:21.28]Vatican City is a small country
[00:24.36]surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome.
[00:29.36]It is the headquarters and seat
[00:32.36]of government of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:37.72]The Vatican Museums contain
[00:40.64]thousands of artworks hundreds of years old
[00:44.72]including paintings by Michelangelo.
[00:49.44]"The emotion of working on something
[00:52.00]like a Michelangelo is truly indescribable," said Zarelli.
[00:59.76]She helped repair one of his wall paintings
[01:03.48]in Vatican City's Pauline Chapel.
[01:08.24]Michelangelo painted during the Renaissance
[01:12.12]period of European history during a growth
[01:16.80]of interest in science, art, and literature.
[01:22.36]Zarelli is part of a special team
[01:25.72]at the Vatican Museums' repair laboratory
[01:30.00]for paintings and wood pieces.
[01:34.32]The team is responsible for looking after
[01:38.12]thousands of square meters of wall paintings,
[01:41.96]including the famous ceiling and walls
[01:45.24]of the Sistine Chapel.
[01:48.36]They also look after some 5,300 oil paintings
[01:53.96]and wooden statues.
[01:57.28]The painting and wood lab is one of eight
[02:00.40]specialized groups in the museums.
[02:05.00]It permitted several news organizations,
[02:08.76]including Reuters, the chance to see its inner workings
[02:13.68]to mark its 100th anniversary.
[02:18.28]Care and repair methods change often
[02:21.92]and today's workers often have to repair mistakes
[02:26.76]from care workers that came before them.
[02:31.12]They repair work from recent history
[02:34.52]to many centuries ago.
[02:38.16]Another problem, usually from the distant past,
[02:42.52]is that restorers were not technicians
[02:46.04]but artists in their own right.
[02:49.72]Francesca Persegati is chief restorer
[02:53.60]at the Vatican Museums.
[02:57.00]She said that some of those artists
[02:59.72]thought they could "improve"
[03:01.72]the original by adding their own work.
[03:06.20]"It's important to be humble in this job,
[03:09.76]to respect the work
[03:11.52]but also to have a scientific background
[03:14.92]to understand the materials," she said.
[03:19.44]Before a painting even reaches the lab,
[03:22.80]another team carries out tests
[03:25.64]to see if paint or color has been added
[03:29.60]since the piece was first made.
[03:33.40]They also check it for possible other work
[03:36.60]below the surface.
[03:39.20]In another part of the lab, Caterina Manisco
[03:43.88]was working on an 1895 painting
[03:48.24]called Madonna and Child
[03:51.00]Between St. Teresa and St. Francis.
[03:55.84]Italian Emma Richards was the artist.
[04:00.36]She painted for the rich and powerful,
[04:03.36]like Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
[04:08.92]Such work was a rarity
[04:11.48]for women artists of the time.
[04:15.16]"Because she was a woman,
[04:17.20]I somehow feel very close to her,"
[04:19.96]said Manisco, an external restorer at the lab.
[04:26.12]To mark the 100th anniversary
[04:28.64]of the paintings and wood lab,
[04:31.28]the Vatican Museums are using special technology.
[04:36.80]It permits visitors to use their phones
[04:40.00]to connect with information
[04:42.16]about the artwork they are looking at.
