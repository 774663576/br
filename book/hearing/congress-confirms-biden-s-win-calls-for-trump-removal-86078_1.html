The confirmation process was halted for hours Wednesday when extremist supporters of President Donald Trump attacked and occupied the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.
美国国会周四早上正式确认候任总统乔·拜登赢得2020年总统大选。这次确认过程中断了数小时，当时川普总统的极端支持者攻占了华盛顿特区的国会大厦。
<p><strong>Resignations, calls for Trump removal
川普幕僚辞职，各方呼吁将川普免职</strong></p>
<p>A growing number of Democratic Party lawmakers and some Republicans are now calling for Trump to be removed from office, 13 days before his term ends on Jan. 20.<br/>
越来越多的民主党议员和一些共和党议员现在呼吁将川普免职，这距离他1月20日任期结束还有13天。</p>
<p>Democratic Party Senate leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, "The quickest and most effective way—it can be done today—to remove this president from office would be for the Vice President to immediately invoke the 25th amendment. If the Vice President and the Cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress must reconvene to impeach President Trump."<br/>
民主党参议院领导人查克·舒默在一份声明中表示：“将这位总统免职的最快和最有效的方式是让副总统立即援引宪法第25号修正案，这在今天就能做到。如果副总统和内阁拒绝站出来，国会必须重新召集起来弹劾川普总统。”</p>
<p>Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger added, "with a heavy heart I am calling for the sake of our Democracy that the 25th Amendment be invoked."<br/>
共和党众议员亚当·金津格补充说：“为了我们的民主，我怀着沉重的心情呼吁援引宪法第25号修正案。”</p>
<p>The 25th Amendment permits a replacement for a sitting president who cannot perform "the powers and duties of his office."<br/>
宪法第25号修正案允许取代不能履行其职务和职责的现任总统。</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet would have to declare Trump unfit. Then, they would send a letter to the speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate saying so. The vice president then becomes acting president.<br/>
副总统迈克·彭斯和大多数内阁必须宣布川普不宜继续担任总统。然后，他们要致函众议院议员和参议院临时主席表达此意。然后副总统将会成为代总统。</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. She joined the call for Trump's removal. She added, "If the vice president and Cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment."<br/>
民主党人南希·佩洛希是众议院议长。她也呼吁将川普免职。她还说：“如果副总统和内阁不采取行动，国会可能会准备推动弹劾。”</p>
<p>Several members of the Trump administration, including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and the first lady's chief of staff, have also resigned in the hours since the attack.<br/>
袭击发生几小时之后，川普政府的几位成员，包括交通部长赵小兰以及第一夫人的幕僚长也提出辞职。</p>
<p><strong>Trump agrees to "orderly transition"<br/>
川普同意有序过渡</strong></p>
<p>Pence, who presided over the joint session of Congress, announced that Biden had won the Electoral College vote early Thursday morning. The count was 306 to 232.<br/>
主持国会联席会议的彭斯周四凌晨宣布拜登赢得了选举人团投票。票数是306票比232票。</p>
<p>Trump has refused to accept the election results and urged his supporters Wednesday to march to the Capitol. However, after Pence confirmed the winner, Trump released a statement.<br/>
川普拒绝接受选举结果，并督促支持者周三前往国会大厦。然而，在彭斯确认胜选者之后，川普发表了声明。</p>
<p>He said, "Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th."<br/>
川普表示：“尽管我完全不同意大选结果，事实也证明了我的观点，但是1月20日将会有序过渡。”</p>
<p>The statement was posted on the Twitter account of a presidential assistant. Twitter and Facebook had suspended Trump's personal accounts following the violence at the Capitol.<br/>
该声明已经发布到一位总统助理的推特账户。在国会大厦发生暴力事件之后，推特和脸书暂停了川普的个人账户。</p>
<p><strong>Trump supporters halted vote count<br/>
川普支持者使计票中止</strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday, a pro-Trump mob of thousands marched to the Capitol after Trump spoke to the group near the White House. The mob broke through metal barriers, pushed past police officers, broke windows and climbed up the sides of the building.<br/>
周三，川普在白宫附近向人群发表了讲话，随后数千名亲川普的暴徒向国会大厦进发。这些暴徒冲破了金属屏障，推开警察，打破窗户，爬上了国会大厦。</p>
<p>As lawmakers were led to safety, the rioters marched through the famous Rotunda area. They carried signs and shouted that Trump had won the election. Police officers blocked the door to the House of Representatives. The violence resulted in four deaths including one rioter who was shot inside the Capitol.<br/>
当议员们被带到安全地点，暴动者穿过著名的圆形大厅前进。他们举着标语，大喊川普赢得了大选。警察封锁了众议院的大门。这次暴力事件导致4人死亡，包括在国会大厦内被枪杀的一名暴徒。</p>
<p>Lawmakers returned to work Wednesday night, after the Capitol was secured. Pence reopened the Senate, telling the attackers, "You did not win. Violence never wins. Freedom wins. This is still the people's house." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell added, "They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed."<br/>
在国会大厦安全之后，议员们周三晚上重返工作岗位。彭斯重新开放了参议院，并对袭击者表示：“你们没有赢。暴力永远不会赢。自由获胜。这仍然是属于人民的国会！”参议院多数党领袖米奇·麦康奈尔补充说：“他们试图破化我们的民主。他们失败了。”</p>
<p>The riots led several Republicans to drop their expected objections to electors for Biden.<br/>
这次骚乱导致数名共和党人放弃了他们预期对选举人团确认拜登胜选的反对。</p>
<p>Senator Mitt Romney of Utah was the Republican Party candidate in the 2012 presidential election. He blamed Trump for the attack.<br/>
犹他州参议员米特·罗姆尼是2012年总统大选的共和党候选人。他将这次袭击归咎于川普。</p>
<p>"What happened here today was an insurrection incited by the president of the United States, " he said, adding, "The best way we could show respect for the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth."<br/>
罗姆尼说：“今天这里发生了一场由美国总统煽动的暴动。”他还表示：“我们对失意选民表达尊重的最好方式是告诉他们真相。”</p>

。
[00:00.04]The United States Congress officially confirmed President-elect Joe Biden
[00:07.44]as the winner of the 2020 presidential election early Thursday.
[00:15.04]The confirmation process was halted for hours Wednesday
[00:20.08]when extremist supporters of President Donald Trump
[00:24.96]attacked and occupied the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.
[00:31.60]A growing number of Democratic Party lawmakers and some Republicans
[00:37.56]are now calling for Trump to be removed from office,
[00:42.36]13 days before his term ends on Jan. 20.
[00:48.96]Democratic Party Senate leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement,
[00:54.76]"The quickest and most effective way—it can be done today
[00:59.96]—to remove this president from office would be for the Vice President
[01:05.48]to immediately invoke the 25th amendment.
[01:09.96]If the Vice President and the Cabinet refuse to stand up,
[01:15.72]Congress must reconvene to impeach President Trump."
[01:21.20]Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger added,
[01:25.16]"with a heavy heart I am calling for the sake of our Democracy
[01:30.44]that the 25th Amendment be invoked."
[01:35.20]The 25th Amendment permits a replacement for a sitting president
[01:40.88]who cannot perform "the powers and duties of his office."
[01:47.08]Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet
[01:52.32]would have to declare Trump unfit.
[01:56.20]Then, they would send a letter to the speaker of the House
[02:00.32]and president pro tempore of the Senate saying so.
[02:05.44]The vice president then becomes acting president.
[02:10.76]Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, is the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
