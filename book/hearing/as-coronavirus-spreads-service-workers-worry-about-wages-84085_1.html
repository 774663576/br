。
[00:00.04]The spread of the new coronavirus is affecting the work and pay of people around the world.
[00:11.32]A delivery driver in Britain worries about getting sick from the people who sign for their purchases each day.
[00:21.84]And a server at a restaurant in the American state of Missouri washes his hands more often and simply hopes for the best.
[00:34.20]Some professionals can work from home or call in sick if they experience signs of COVID-19, the disease the virus causes.
[00:46.24]But that is not possible for service workers who often come into contact with the public.
[00:54.72]Their situation is made worse by limited or non-existent sick leave and health insurance.
[01:04.64]"The recommendations on what people should be doing to protect themselves
[01:10.12]really gives a sharp indication of the divide between white collar and blue collar workers,"
[01:18.20]said Shannon Liss-Reardon, a workers rights lawyer in Boston, Massachusetts.
[01:25.44]White-collar jobs are those that take place in an office or other professional environment.
[01:33.68]Blue-collar jobs are those that require a person to perform more physical labor of some kind.
[01:42.80]In the United States, about 27 percent of non-government workers
[01:49.04]do not get paid sick leave, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says.
[01:56.56]There is no federal sick leave policy in the United States,
[02:01.60]but 12 of the 50 states as well as Washington D.C. require employers to offer paid sick leave.
[02:12.96]And, employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance.
[02:21.20]That protection is not extended to part-time or independent workers.
[02:29.12]Some Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation to deal with the issue.
[02:36.68]It would require employers to let workers earn seven days of paid sick leave.
[02:44.52]It would also provide an additional 14 days of paid sick leave
[02:50.40]in the event of a public health emergency, including the current one.
[02:57.80]On Monday, President Donald Trump said he was seeking help
[03:02.76]for hourly-wage workers to make sure they will not miss a paycheck.
[03:09.64]In Britain, delivery driver Ed Cross worries about catching the virus
[03:15.60]from the machine he gives to people to sign for their goods.
[03:21.68]"People have coughed on their hand and then got hold of my machine," said Cross, who is 53 years old.
[03:31.24]That is what "we face daily," he said.
[03:36.36]The British government last week made it easier to collect sick pay.
[03:42.60]It also is working on changes to help millions of non-permanent workers like Cross
[03:50.92]who do not meet conditions for receiving sick pay.
[03:56.32]And, the company he works for has announced a financial deal
[04:01.44]to help workers if they need to restrict themselves to home.
[04:08.08]The new virus spread has shown huge holes in health care coverage at a time when people may need it most.
[04:19.64]Most European countries and Canada have universal healthcare systems.
[04:26.44]But the United States has a mix of public and private insurance.
[04:34.24]Joey Ingham works at a restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri.
[04:39.44]He does not have health insurance.
[04:42.64]The restaurant is popular with business travelers, he says.
