。
[00:00.04]A new report from two international climate agencies
[00:05.56]has found that Europe is the fastest-warming
[00:10.28]major land mass in the world.
[00:13.64]The report for 2023
[00:17.08]is a product of the United Nation's
[00:20.24]World Meteorological Organization
[00:23.84]and the European Union's climate agency, Copernicus.
[00:29.08]The document states that parts of Spain,
[00:34.00]France, Italy and Greece
[00:37.12]reported up to ten days
[00:39.44]of extreme heat stress in 2023.
[00:44.80]Heat stress measures a mix
[00:48.08]of environmental effects on the human body
[00:51.88]in an effort to establish a "feels like" temperature.
[00:56.84]This level is defined as a temperature
[01:00.80]that feels like more than 46 degrees Celsius.
[01:06.04]Health experts say heat stress
[01:09.88]can present immediate risks
[01:12.16]of heat stroke and other conditions
[01:15.72]Elisabeth Hamdouch is a member of
[01:19.48]the EU's executive commission
[01:22.48]and works on Copernicus activities.
[01:26.04]She told the Associated Press
[01:29.12]Europe's heat stress last year
[01:32.40]was marked by "record temperatures,
[01:35.52]wildfires, heat waves,
[01:38.56]glacier ice loss and lack of snowfall."
[01:42.72]The report said that temperatures in Europe
[01:46.56]are currently rising at about twice the worldwide average.
[01:52.20]Deaths related to heat in Europe have increased
[01:57.32]by about 30 percent over the last 20 years, it said.
[02:02.88]Last year, the researchers said
[02:06.12]more than 150 lives were directly lost
[02:10.80]in connection with storms, floods and wildfires.
[02:16.72]"Hundreds of thousands of people
[02:19.72]were affected by extreme climate events in 2023,"
[02:24.96]said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus'
[02:30.32]Climate Change Service.
[02:33.00]He added that the climate effects
[02:35.68]were responsible for economic losses
[02:39.16]across Europe estimated to be "at least
[02:43.32]in the tens of billions of euros."
[02:47.32]Last month, Copernicus urged governments
[02:51.76]to prepare healthcare systems
[02:54.52]for the increasing effects of climate change.
[02:58.40]It also called on the EU to establish rules
[03:03.28]to protect outdoor workers from extreme heat.
[03:08.04]The report noted that the release of greenhouse gases
[03:13.56]was the biggest cause of last year's exceptional heat.
[03:18.32]Other environmental effects also played a part
[03:22.84]in the high temperatures,
[03:24.56]including the El Nino current in the Pacific Ocean.
[03:29.28]El Nino is a warming of surface temperatures
[03:34.12]in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean.
[03:38.12]This event usually causes hot,
[03:41.92]dry weather in Asia and Australia
[03:45.20]and also can drive weather changes
[03:48.60]in other parts of the world.
[03:51.36]The report noted that severe heat
[03:54.92]can fuel other extreme weather, including flooding.
[03:59.68]A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture,
[04:04.04]possibly causing more rain if the right conditions exist.
[04:09.20]In Slovenia, floods affected 1.5 million people last year.
[04:15.84]Greece suffered the EU's biggest wildfire on record,
[04:21.68]reportedly stretching 960 square kilometers.
[04:27.08]And mountain glaciers shrank about 10 percent
[04:32.16]during 2022 and 2023, the report said.
[04:38.28]Copernicus' Buontempo said,
[04:42.04]"Some of the events of 2023
[04:45.28]took the scientific community by surprise
[04:49.32]because of their intensity,
[04:51.40]their speed of onset, extent and duration."
[04:56.56]Copernicus reported that March
[04:59.68]marked the 10th straight month
[05:02.20]of record monthly temperatures.
[05:04.68]The agency has reported record world temperatures
[05:09.40]every month since last June.
[05:12.44]The latest report said the average sea surface temperature
[05:18.08]for ocean areas across Europe
[05:21.16]reached its highest yearly level in 2023.
