<p>The new legislation will not reduce her loan payments because the law has not yet taken effect.<br/>新法律不会减少她的贷款还款额，因为这项法律尚未生效。</p>
<p>Her loan is considered large for the Cambodian microfinance industry. Seventy percent of microfinance industry, of MFI, loans are under $500.<br/>她的贷款对柬埔寨小额贷款行业来说是一笔巨款。小额贷款行业70%的贷款低于500美元。</p>

。
[00:00.16]The Cambodian government has ordered a limit on interest rates on small loans.
[00:08.04]The decision comes before local elections are set to take place in June.
[00:15.68]The 18 percent limit on the microfinance industry interest rates takes effect on April 1.
[00:26.16]Microfinance businesses operate in many developing countries.
[00:32.52]They accept deposits and provide small loans to people in the developing world.
[00:40.80]In Sokai is a 32-year-old Cambodian garment worker.
[00:47.12]She recently received a microfinance loan of $5,000.
[00:55.20]She must repay it within four years.
[00:59.92]"I borrowed $5000 and I bought chickens, built the house,
[01:06.44]and my husband bought a boat, fishing nets and other items," she said.
[01:13.48]She will pay interest at a rate of 22 percent a year.
[01:21.28]The new legislation will not reduce her loan payments
[01:25.53]because the law has not yet taken effect.
[01:29.84]Her loan is considered large for the Cambodian microfinance industry.
[01:36.52]Seventy percent of microfinance industry, of MFI, loans are under $500.
[01:46.92]Sokai had not heard of the new law.
[01:50.52]But it has caused a lot of concern
[01:53.32]among the private microfinance businesses in Cambodia.
[01:59.72]Microfinance loans are usually for less than one year.
[02:05.84]Their interest rates are very high -- 30 percent or more.
[02:11.96]Microfinance industry supporters say this is necessary
[02:17.60]because the costs of servicing small, risky loans are higher.
[02:24.67]The high cost of the loans has not reduced demand, however.
[02:31.32]Cambodia's microfinance industry is growing quickly.
[02:38.36]In 2015, there were 1.5 million depositors and more than two million borrowers.
[02:49.00]MFIs are in every province of the country of 15 million people.
[02:57.08]Almost all the loans go to people living outside Phnom Pehn, Cambodia's capital.
[03:05.88]Most borrowers are women.
[03:09.56]The new law comes before local elections in June.
[03:13.92]A national vote is to take place in the middle of 2018.
[03:19.88]Supporters of the new law say the limit is meant
[03:23.68]to protect Cambodians from paying high rates.
[03:28.60]Lawmakers also want to increase access to Cambodia's financial system.
[03:35.80]Borrowers often use their land or home as a security for the loan.
[03:41.70]They can lose their property if they are unable to pay.
[03:47.08]Interest rate limits are not unusual. Many countries have them.
[03:53.20]But, the World Bank says they are becoming less popular.
[03:58.72]Some industry observers, however,
[04:01.76]say the law limiting interest rates will have a negative effect.
[04:08.32]Stephen Higgins is with Mekong Strategic Partners.
[04:13.45]The company gives business advice.
[04:17.24]"Ideally we shouldn't have this cap.
[04:19.36]The interest rates in Cambodia for these small loans,
[04:22.80]they're actually amongst the lowest in the world. And people forget that."
[04:26.16]Higgins says the cost of lending for small loans is high.
[04:32.84]He says microfinance businesses need to charge a 30 percent interest rate
[04:40.44]for a $500 nine-month loan to make a small profit.
[04:47.96]Opponents of the limits say microfinance businesses may stop offering loans.
[04:55.64]That, they say, will force rural people
[04:59.44]to go to moneylenders who charge much higher interest rates.
[05:05.84]The Cambodia Microfinance Association (CMA)
[05:09.45]is a non-profit organization based in Phnom Penh.
[05:14.04]It supports microfinance businesses.
[05:18.04]It says its members will need to reduce costs
[05:22.28]and become more efficient in order to survive.
[05:27.12]Mey Kalyan is an economist and adviser to the government.
[05:32.60]He supports the law.
[05:35.20]He says it will help protect small farmers from agriculture-related debt.
[05:41.56]He says that farmers who take out high interest loans of
[05:46.24]30 percent or more struggle to make a profit.
[05:52.16]CMA chairman Hout Ieng Tong says at least some CMA members
[05:59.12]will still offer small loans.
[06:02.52]But it is unclear whether the new interest rate limit
[06:06.68]will hurt deposits in microfinance businesses
[06:11.04]or will drive borrowers to higher-cost moneylenders.
[06:17.20]I'm Mario Ritter.
