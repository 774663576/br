<p>Hi there! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Le about the difference between the words "university" and "college."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>Hello Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: University vs. College " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-0262-08dc18618d92_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: University vs. College </span></div>
<p>I love this program.</p>
<p>Would you mind explaining the difference between "university" and "college?"</p>
<p>I often misunderstand these two nouns.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Le</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>We are glad you love our programs, Le, and thank you for writing to us.</p>
<p>This is an important question, especially for international students who might want to apply to U.S. colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Both places provide higher education. But their <strong>degree</strong> offerings, number of students and costs differ.</p>
<p>Let's start with "university."</p>
<p><strong>University</strong></p>
<p>"Universities" are large schools offering higher education that includes <strong>undergraduate</strong> and <strong>graduate</strong> degree programs.</p>
<p>Most <strong>faculty</strong> at universities are not only teachers but also researchers.</p>
<p>Large universities have tens of thousands of students and have students from all over the U.S. and the world.</p>
<p>Since universities offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees, they may offer many classes in many fields. But the cost of attending a university can be high, especially at private universities in the U.S. which are not supported by state governments.</p>
<p>An example of a public university is <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/west-virginia-university-to-cut-languages-creative-programs/7249320.html">West Virginia University</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a private university is <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/us-colleges-ask-for-more-writing-after-affirmative-action-ban/7209025.html">Yale University</a> in the state of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Let's move on to "college."</p>
<p><strong>College </strong></p>
<p>"College" can also mean a school where students receive higher education. Many high school students are asked:</p>
<p><em>Where do you want to go to college?</em></p>
<p>The answer to this question could be a university, a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/community-colleges-offer-more-programs-at-low-cost/6813478.html">community college</a> or even a <strong>trade</strong> school.</p>
<p>We also refer to students in higher education as "college students."</p>
<p><em>When Liz was a college student, she took classes during the day and worked in a hotel at night. </em></p>
<p>"College" is often used as a general word for a school offering education after high school. But "college" can have more specific meanings too.</p>
<p>Colleges are smaller schools that focus on undergraduate programs. They include community colleges, private and liberal arts colleges and even technical colleges and trade schools.</p>
<p>Faculty at community colleges mainly teach and advise students, rather than do research.</p>
<p>A college can also be a division within a university. For example, a university might have a "college of arts and sciences," which gives bachelor's degrees.</p>
<p>Colleges are smaller and have fewer students: hundreds to thousands of students rather than tens of thousands of students.</p>
<p>Because colleges, especially community colleges, serve a smaller population, they have fewer international students.</p>
<p>Classes are also likely to be limited at colleges, especially at some community colleges. They might offer general education classes, <strong>career</strong> or technical degrees. Community colleges might offer some four-year undergraduate degrees, but many offer two-year programs. The aim might be for students to transfer to a four-year school. Career or technical <strong>certificates</strong> permit students to immediately enter the workforce upon completing the classes.</p>
<p><em>She went to a community college to study cooking to get a job working in a restaurant. </em></p>
<p>The cost of attending a community college is lower. The schools offer a low-cost way to gain college credits. However, private colleges and some technical schools may be just as costly as private universities.</p>
