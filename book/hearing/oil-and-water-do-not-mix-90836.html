。
[00:07.52]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:10.92]from VOA Learning English.
[00:14.36]Oil and water are two very different substances.
[00:24.52]Oil is thick. Water is thin.
[00:29.60]If you pour oil into water,
[00:32.24]they do not mix,
[00:34.20]and the oil floats to the top.
[00:38.12]This difficult relationship
[00:40.28]can play a part in some laboratory experiments.
[00:45.12]It can play a big part in kitchens as we cook food.
[00:50.20]It can also be used to describe some of our personal relationships.
[00:57.32]If we say two people are like oil and water,
[01:01.44]it means they do not get along.
[01:05.52]They are not compatible.
[01:08.40]Things like objects, elements, and people that do not
[01:13.24]or cannot mix together easily
[01:16.20]can be compared to oil and water.
[01:20.64]Here is an example from experience.
[01:23.80]My friend often asked me to watch her cat Bluey
[01:28.36]when she would travel out of town.
[01:31.08]Usually, cats love me but not Bluey.
[01:36.08]He would make terrible cat noises
[01:38.68]as soon as I walked into the apartment.
[01:42.72]Every time I tried to pet him,
[01:45.00]he would bite and scratch me.
[01:47.64]So, I didn't like him either.
[01:51.52]We were like oil and water.
[01:54.40]I took care of him, but for the most part,
[01:58.52]we ignored each other.
[02:01.48]This expression describes how oil
[02:04.20]and water naturally separate.
[02:07.08]They are incompatible.
[02:09.44]So are people who have nothing in common
[02:12.52]and do not get along.
[02:15.60]We sometimes say oil and water do not mix
[02:19.52]to express an opinion that two things do not go together.
[02:26.08]Here is another "oil" expression.
[02:29.32]If you pour oil on troubled water,
[02:32.24]you calm a tense situation.
[02:36.28]You might not hear this expression too much in America
[02:40.04]as it is mainly a British usage.
[02:44.96]Now let's hear the expression used between two friends.
[02:50.00]A: I'm worried about my birthday party.
[02:53.56]B: Why? It's not until next weekend.
[02:57.52]A: It doesn't matter.
[02:59.32]My two best friends will never find a way to get along.
[03:04.92]Ben likes to plan everything
[03:08.72]and is a bit of a control freak.
[03:11.80]Kara is super easy going
[03:14.56]and likes to play things by ear.
[03:17.72]B: Those two sound like oil and water.
[03:21.68]A: They are! And they want to throw the party together.
[03:26.72]What a truly bad idea.
[03:29.88]B: I have a good idea. I'll come to the party early.
[03:34.52]If things between them get heated,
[03:37.04]I'll get between them and calm things down.
[03:40.88]A: You'll be the oil on my troubled waters!
[03:44.28]B: Sure. Whatever you say.
[03:47.40]I just want to have fun at your party!
[03:50.00]And that's all the time we have
[03:53.24]for this Words and Their Stories.
[03:56.12]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.
