。
[00:00.04]Research in the growing field of space medicine
[00:04.36]has identified many ways
[00:06.64]in which zero-gravity and other conditions
[00:09.84]can affect the human body.
[00:12.40]Now, a new study finds that astronauts
[00:16.20]are more likely to experience headaches in space
[00:19.68]than previously known.
[00:22.52]The study involved 24 astronauts from the U.S.,
[00:26.68]European and Japanese space agencies.
[00:30.56]They all traveled aboard the International Space Station
[00:34.44]for up to 26 weeks.
[00:36.96]All but two of them
[00:38.84]reported experiencing headaches in space.
[00:43.16]Headaches struck a larger number of astronauts
[00:46.32]than the scientists had expected.
[00:48.88]The headaches continued
[00:51.12]even after the crew had been in space
[00:53.32]long enough for the body to adjust.
[00:56.52]The process takes place
[00:58.20]in the first two weeks in space.
[01:02.12]The headaches during the early period
[01:04.60]often presented similarly to migraines.
[01:08.64]Those experienced later in space travel
[01:11.76]presented more like a tension headache, the study found.
[01:16.48]Neurologist WPJ van Oosterhout of Zaans Medical Center
[01:21.88]and the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands
[01:25.72]was lead author of the study.
[01:28.24]He said the research suggests different processes
[01:32.60]"are involved for the early headache episodes
[01:35.72]- the first one to two weeks in space
[01:38.68]- versus later headache episodes."
[01:41.32]The study was published this week in the journal Neurology.
[01:46.76]"In the first week, the body has to adapt to the lack of gravity,
[01:50.84]known as space adaptation syndrome.
[01:53.84]This phenomenon is similar to motion sickness,
[01:57.60]and can cause nausea, vomiting and dizziness,
[02:01.32]and headaches," Van Oosterhout said.
[02:04.08]"The later headaches could result
[02:06.52]from ... more fluid accumulating
[02:08.56]in the upper part of the body and head...."
[02:12.68]Migraines experienced on Earth are often throbbing,
[02:16.48]and last four to seven hours,
[02:19.12]along with symptoms like nausea,
[02:21.52]vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound,
[02:25.04]Van Oosterhout said.
[02:26.92]Tension headaches on Earth usually are a dull pain
[02:30.96]felt over the whole head, he said.
[02:35.48]The astronauts, 23 men and one woman,
[02:38.68]had an average age of about 47.
[02:41.88]They visited the International Space Station for missions
[02:45.68]that took place from November 2011 to June 2018.
[02:51.00]A total of 378 headaches were reported
[02:54.96]by 22 of the 24 astronauts
[02:57.92]during a total of 3,596 days in orbit.
[03:02.92]None of the 24 reported headaches
[03:05.92]in the three months after returning to Earth.
[03:08.84]None had ever had migraines before their time in space
[03:13.00]and none had a history of usual headache attacks.
[03:17.84]Documented effects of space travel
[03:20.24]include bone and muscle weakening, or atrophy,
[03:23.60]changes in the brain,
[03:25.32]cardiovascular system and immune system.
[03:29.48]Astronauts have also
[03:31.08]experienced effects on the inner ear
[03:33.32]and a condition involving the eyes.
[03:36.60]The risk of cancer from
[03:37.92]high radiation levels in space is another concern.
[03:43.84]Experts are unsure how much of a barrier these effects
[03:47.48]might have on human space travel over long periods,
[03:51.04]like trips to Mars or beyond.
[03:54.36]"The honest answer is that
[03:56.04]we don't know the effects of long-duration space travel
[03:59.20]- possibly years - on the human body," Van Oosterhout said,
[04:03.56]adding, this "is a clear task for the field of space medicine."
