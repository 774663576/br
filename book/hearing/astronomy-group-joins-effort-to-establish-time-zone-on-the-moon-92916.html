[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]An international group of astronomers
[00:03.80]has joined efforts seeking to establish
[00:08.08]a separate time zone for the moon.
[00:11.36]The French-based International
[00:14.84]Astronomical Union (IAU)
[00:18.64]recently approved a resolution on the matter
[00:22.28]during the group's General Assembly meeting
[00:25.84]in Cape Town, South Africa.
[00:28.68]The resolution calls on space organizations
[00:33.52]around the world to cooperate
[00:36.76]on establishing a standard clock for the moon.
[00:40.96]The moon's orbital movements around Earth
[00:45.08]make one day on the lunar surface
[00:48.24]equal to 29.5 Earth days.
[00:52.68]And because the moon has less gravity compared to Earth,
[00:58.64]time moves slightly faster there,
[01:01.80]about 58.7 microseconds quicker each day.
[01:08.72]Susan Stewart is an astronomer
[01:12.12]with the U.S. Naval Observatory.
[01:15.20]She helped create the resolution
[01:18.36]at the IAU conference.
[01:21.12]Stewart told The Associated Press
[01:25.00]the aim of the measure is quite simple:
[01:28.56]"To work together to establish (a) standard time."
[01:33.32]Currently, moon operations
[01:36.40]run on the time of the country
[01:39.12]that is launching spacecraft.
[01:41.48]But supporters of creating a separate time zone
[01:46.16]say this method will have to change;
[01:49.16]more countries and private space companies
[01:53.24]are starting to launch their own moon missions.
[01:57.56]Last year, the European Space Agency (ESA)
[02:03.00]pushed for the creation of a lunar clock.
[02:06.72]And earlier this year, the White House
[02:10.04]directed the U.S. space agency NASA
[02:13.72]and other agencies to come up
[02:16.60]with a timekeeping plan
[02:19.16]for the moon by the end of 2026.
[02:23.20]ESA noted communication
[02:26.72]and navigation systems built for the moon
[02:30.60]will perform much better
[02:32.88]if they use "the same timescale."
[02:36.36]In addition, a separate time zone will support
[02:40.68]"the many other crewed and uncrewed missions"
[02:44.64]planned for the future, ESA said.
[02:48.52]In the past, NASA also considered
[02:52.36]establishing a separate time zone
[02:55.44]for the International Space Station (ISS).
[02:59.76]But the agency decided against it.
[03:03.00]Instead, the ISS
[03:05.72]runs on Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC,
[03:10.96]which is based on time kept by atomic clocks.
[03:16.16]NASA officials say this system
[03:20.04]helps ease the time difference between NASA
[03:23.80]and the Canadian Space Agency,
[03:26.52]as well as other space partners
[03:28.96]in Russia, Japan and Europe.
[03:33.16]The international team
[03:35.16]looking at establishing a lunar time zone
[03:38.60]has said it is still deciding
[03:41.12]whether a single organization
[03:43.48]should be chosen to set
[03:45.72]and keep time on the moon.
[03:48.84]Bijunath Patla is a physicist
[03:52.16]at the U.S. Commerce Department's
[03:54.88]National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[03:59.36]He told the AP that astronomers
[04:02.92]are still deciding
[04:04.56]on how a lunar clock would work.
[04:07.68]Patla said, "I think the community
[04:11.32]has realized that this needs to be done.
[04:14.60]And this is the beginning."
