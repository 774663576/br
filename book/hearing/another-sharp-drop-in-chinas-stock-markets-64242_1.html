<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Another Sharp Drop on China’s Stock Exchanges]
[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]Stock price indexes in China had their sharpest 
[00:04.81]one-day drop in eight years on Monday. 
[00:08.13]Stock indexes also decreased around the world but to a lesser extent.
[00:15.00]The Shanghai Composite index lost 8.5 percent. 
[00:20.50]Another index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen, 
[00:27.15]in southern China, fell by 8.6 percent.
[00:31.92]Experts say Monday's price drop came from investors trying to secure profits 
[00:39.93]following recent Chinese government efforts to support prices. 
[00:45.22]In early July, China's central bank 
[00:49.56]made billions of dollars available to brokerages. 
[00:53.65]The money was for the purchase of shares in companies 
[00:58.32]to prevent their prices from falling too far. 
[01:01.97]At that time, more than 1,400 companies requested 
[01:08.60]that trading in their stocks be stopped to avoid further losses. 
[01:15.14]That number is now smaller.
[01:18.62]Other experts say investors reacted to reports 
[01:24.45]that the International Monetary Fund 
[01:27.58]wanted China to reduce its market intervention. 
[01:32.44]Also, Chinese industrial companies reported earnings 
[01:38.71]that were worse than expected and pork prices rose.
[01:44.29]Raymond Yeung is a China economist 
[01:48.83]at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. 
[01:52.62]He says the main reason for the sharp drop 
[01:56.62]is that Chinese stock markets are not done de-leveraging. 
[02:02.45]De-leveraging means to reduce the amount of money borrowed to pay for investments.
[02:09.66]"Because of the high leverage exposure of the Chinese markets, 
[02:15.75]anything that triggers a decline in such a short time 
[02:20.56]will see some negative spiral effects 
[02:24.57]in such highly leveraged markets," Yeung says.
[02:29.12]Many investors borrowed money to buy stocks as China's mainland stock markets 
[02:37.58]rose by about 150 percent over the past year. 
[02:43.08]Borrowing in this way is known as margin lending. 
[02:48.59]But as markets have fallen, many investors could struggle to pay back the loans.
[02:56.48]Raymond Yeung says he expects 
[03:00.71]Chinese stock regulators to continue restricting such practices.
[03:06.58]China has taken a number of measures to try to make sure the markets do not fall. 
[03:13.74]These include requiring anyone with five percent of shares 
[03:19.57]in a company to hold them for six months.
[03:23.47]Lu Suiqi is an associate professor of economics at Peking University. 
[03:31.86]He says regulators will not be able to keep the markets from falling, 
[03:38.54]and they should not try to do so. 
[03:40.86]Mr. Lu says Chinese stocks remain too costly.
[03:46.76]"The government's rescue measures could curb the slides in a short term, 
[03:53.82]but are powerless in reversing the long-term trend," he says.
[03:59.71]I'm Mario Ritter.
