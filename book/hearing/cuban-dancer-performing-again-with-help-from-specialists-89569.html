[00:00.04]A rare medical problem almost crippled Cuban dancer Yankiel Vásquez.
[00:07.44]But a team of physiotherapists helped him recover.
[00:11.60]The 29-year-old Vásquez is again dancing with Cuba's National Ballet.
[00:18.24]Vásquez is from the town of Mantua in rural western Cuba.
[00:23.80]He joined the ballet in 2011.
[00:27.32]But shortly after he started, he became sick with Guillain-Barré syndrome.
[00:34.04]That disease of the immune system attacks the nerves.
[00:38.84]It sometimes makes a person unable to move their arms or legs.
[00:45.04]When Vásquez was sick, he thought his dream
[00:48.48]of dancing with the ballet was finished.
[00:51.64]Vásquez said, "It took me several months to learn to walk again."
[00:57.92]He had to recover physically and mentally.
[01:01.36]He said the recovery process was "intense."
[01:06.16]This year he returned to the National Ballet,
[01:09.60]where he is now a "first dancer."
[01:12.72]This means he has reached an elite level in the ballet.
[01:17.32]Vásquez said: "Reaching ‘first dancer'
[01:21.04]is what one dreams of as a child."
[01:23.92]Cuba's National Ballet began in 1948.
[01:28.48]It is one of the world's most famous ballet companies.
[01:33.04]For many years, a school linked to the ballet
[01:37.24]has helped its students dance in many places around the world.
[01:42.24]The Cuban National Ballet has 70 dancers.
[01:46.24]The company also has a team of physiotherapists
[01:50.36]who help the dancers stay healthy.
[01:53.24]The team helped Vásquez become healthy again.
[01:56.80]A team of physiotherapists from Chile recently arrived as well.
[02:03.64]They are helping the dancers prepare for performances.
[02:08.08]And they are sharing their knowledge
[02:10.36]with the Cuban team of physiotherapists.
[02:13.80]Viengsay Valdés is director of the National Ballet of Cuba.
[02:19.68]She noted that physical exercises are very important.
[02:24.36]"A dancer is like an athlete.
