<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about one of those English words that changes meaning depending on the words added to it. "Double" is just such a word.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Identical twins Taiwo Adejare and Kehinde Adejare pose for a picture in Igbo Ora, Oyo State, Nigeria April 4, 2019. Picture taken April 4, 2019. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/B6908C41-A7C2-40C5-B0FC-E778873A89D2_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Identical twins Taiwo Adejare and Kehinde Adejare pose for a picture in Igbo Ora, Oyo State, Nigeria April 4, 2019. Picture taken April 4, 2019. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde</span></div>
<p>It is such a useful word that we should discuss it <u>on the double</u>! That means quickly. If I say, "Get here on the double," it means get here as soon as you can. Please.</p>
<p>But that is just one of the many uses of this <strong>versatile </strong>word.</p>
<p>"Double" means two of something. So, if you <u>double up</u> on something, you increase the amount by two. For example, if I plan to enter a swimming race, I might want to <u>double up</u> on my training. So, if I train one hour a day, I would increase my training to two hours a day.</p>
<p>Now, if you add "down" to "double" you get something completely different. If you <u>double down,</u> you stick to a position or undertaking even if it is not a good one. You are not willing to change your position at all. For example, instead of apologizing for a poorly worded statement, the politician doubled down and said it again. Here, we could also say he <strong><u>dug in</u></strong><u> his heels</u>.</p>
<p>Now, if something does <u>double duty</u> is serves two purposes. For example, an exercise bike serves double duty if I can also dry my towels on it. People can also do double duty. That means they do two jobs or the work of two people.</p>
<p>Let's combine "double" with the word "back." If you <u>double back</u>, you turn around and come back the same way that you came. One time I took a hike and got a little lost. So, instead of continuing, I just doubled back: I returned the way that I came.</p>
<p>A delayed reaction to something that takes you by surprise is called a <u>double take</u>. We usually say <u>do a double take</u>. For example, I did a double take when I saw my co-worker after a year. She had a new haircut and a <strong>tattoo</strong>. I had to <u>double-check</u> if it was even her. When I looked again and made sure it was my friend, I told her how much I liked her tattoo. Then she <u>doubled over</u> with laughter. As it turns out, it was a temporary tattoo. When we <u>double over</u>, we bend over and cannot stand up straight because of laughter or from pain.</p>
<p>For some reason, certain "double" words are not good.</p>
<p>For example, <u>double-crossing</u> someone means to cheat them. A double-cross is a <strong>betrayal</strong>. We could also use the word <u>double-dealing</u> which has a similar meaning.</p>
<p><u>Double talk</u> is language that appears to be meaningful but, in fact, is a mixture of sense and nonsense. And <u>doublespeak</u> is language used to trick people by hiding some of the truth.</p>
<p>A <u>double standard</u> is a set of <strong>principles</strong> or rules that apply differently and usually more severely to one group of people than to another. For example, people are not surprised if an older man dates a much younger woman. However, those same people may criticize a woman who dates a much younger man. That is a common <u>double standard</u> because the outcomes are so different.</p>
<p>And that's the end of <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_4BdUHSsO">this</a> <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. I hope you enjoyed this exploration of the many word combinations using "double." You may want to <u>double up</u> on your English lessons by practicing with the combinations of this very useful word.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>
