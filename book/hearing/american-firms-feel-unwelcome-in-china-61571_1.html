[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:04.07]About 500 American companies operating in China 
[00:08.90]say they are making a profit. 
[00:11.19]But top-level officials with the companies say 
[00:15.42]they increasingly feel unwelcome 
[00:18.26]and targeted by the Chinese government.
[00:21.50]The American Chamber of Commerce in China 
[00:24.99]released the results of a survey 
[00:27.54]of its members earlier this week. 
[00:30.32]Fifty-seven percent of top-level managers said 
[00:35.15]they feel Chinese officials are concerned 
[00:38.25]about investigating foreign companies. 
[00:41.54]The survey said that 47 percent of the officials 
[00:46.22]felt unwelcome doing business in the country. 
[00:49.71]That was an increase from 44 percent in the group's report last year. 
[00:56.53]However, most businesses asked -- 70 percent -- 
[01:01.17]said they remain "profitable" or "very profitable."
[01:05.37]James Zimmerman is chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, 
[01:11.49]also known as AmCham China.
[01:14.49]"People are making money. But there are always challenges. 
[01:18.31]For the last 35 years there have been challenges. 
[01:20.67]Anyone that says there was a time 
[01:23.18]when there was no challenges or there was that golden era 
[01:27.39]forgets that there has always been challenges here," Zimmerman said.
[01:31.08]In China, the investigation of foreign companies 
[01:35.24]has become common since President Xi Jinping took power. 
[01:40.10]Under his leadership, 
[01:42.40]China has launched a campaign to improve food safety, 
[01:46.97]and against official corruption. 
[01:49.44]Chinese officials have examined the operations of Microsoft, 
[01:55.32]Qualcomm, Audi, McDonald's and other foreign companies.
[02:01.28]James Zimmerman says he does not believe 
[02:05.48]the government is targeting such companies on purpose.
[02:09.13]AmCham China represents more than 1,000 U.S. businesses. 
[02:15.23]Its representatives often meet with U.S. and Chinese officials.
[02:21.21]Mr. Zimmerman has been working on China-related trade issues 
[02:26.91]for more than 20 years. 
[02:29.06]He says that he was personally 
[02:32.21]involved in developing China's Anti-Monopoly Law.
[02:36.39]He says many of the cases against foreign companies 
[02:41.76]were not raised first by the government.
[02:44.96]It can be difficult for private companies 
[02:49.11]to operate in China's business environment. 
[02:52.32]The companies have trouble competing against state-owned businesses. 
[02:58.15]The country has experienced huge changes 
[03:02.76]since it moved from a planned economy to one 
[03:06.28]that is more market-driven. 
[03:08.14]However, the state still has a strong influence in business.
[03:13.55]The study found that 83 percent of those 
[03:19.13]who gave answers noted concerns 
[03:22.27]about the effects of Internet censorship on their businesses. 
[03:26.50]Mr. Zimmerman says that companies are mainly concerned 
[03:31.40]about how Internet controls can affect the flow of information. 
[03:36.45]Those are things that affect everyone, he says.
[03:40.89]He adds that Internet censorship affects some businesses more than others. 
[03:46.44]However, services industries 
[03:49.65]that depend on information are among the hardest hit.
[03:53.81]And that's the Economics Report from VOA Learning English.
