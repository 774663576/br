<p>The pro-Palestinian protests at colleges across the United States have spread to <strong>campuses</strong> in Europe.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, German police broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian protesters at Berlin's Free University (FU).

<p><strong>The rest of Europe</strong></p>
<p>Students have also held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain.</p>
<p>The protesters say they are against Israel's offensive in the Palestinian territory of Gaza, which started in late October 2023. Israel started the war in reaction to a terrorist attack by Hamas that killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on October 7.</p>
<p>The war has destroyed much of the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas, says about 35,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p>
<p>In Finland, protesters from the Students for Palestine group set up an encampment outside the main building at the University of Helsinki. The group members said they would stay there until the university cuts ties with Israeli schools.</p>
<p>In Denmark, students set up a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Copenhagen. The university said students can protest but called on them to respect the rules on campus grounds. On their Facebook page, members of the activist group Students Against the Occupation said attempts to talk to the administration over the past two years about ending investment and ties in Israel have not gone anywhere.</p>
<p>In Italy, students at the University of Bologna set up a tent encampment over the weekend to demand an end to the war in Gaza. Students organized similar protests in Rome and Naples, which were largely peaceful.</p>
<p>In Spain, students have spent over a week at a pro-Palestinian encampment on the University of Valencia campus. Students set up similar camps on Monday at the University of Barcelona and the University of the Basque Country.</p>
<p>In Paris, French police peacefully removed several students last week from the Paris Institute of Political Studies after they had gathered in support of Palestinians. Protests also took place last week at other universities in France, including in Lille and Lyon.</p>

[01:03.40]"This form of protest

[02:38.16]"We share the anger and bewilderment
[02:41.32]over the war, and we understand
[02:44.44]that there are protests over it.
[02:47.56]We stress that within the university,
[02:50.56]dialogue about it is the only answer."
[02:55.40]Students have also held protests
[02:58.20]or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark,
[03:01.92]Italy, Spain, France and Britain.
[03:05.92]The protesters say they are against Israel's offensive

[04:28.44]on campus grounds.
[04:31.08]On their Facebook page,
[04:33.08]members of the activist group
[04:35.08]Students Against the Occupation
