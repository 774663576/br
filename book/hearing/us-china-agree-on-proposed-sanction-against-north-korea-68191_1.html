[00:01.20]The United States and China have agreed to place tougher financial sanctions on North Korea.
[00:08.60]This cooperation between the U.S. and China against North Korea
[00:14.92]shows a shift in their relationship, said The New York Times.
[00:20.56]The sanctions are meant to punish North Korea for its recent nuclear and long-range missile tests.
[00:29.88]The United States and China reached an agreement on imposing new U.N. sanctions on North Korea Wednesday.
[00:39.08]Details have yet to be released on the proposal.
[00:45.40]The announcement came after China's foreign minister Wang Yi's visit to Washington.
[00:51.80]He met with Secretary of State John Kerry and with National Security Adviser Susan Rice earlier this week.
[01:03.24]U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price
[01:07.88]said Rice and Wang were in agreement on a "strong and united" response to the North Korean tests.
[01:18.56]South Korea's Foreign Ministry spokesman called the draft resolution, "strong and comprehensive."
[01:27.80]He said, "It contains many effective components which are stronger than anything in past."
[01:37.56]The United States has supported tough economic sanctions
[01:42.12]to pressure North Korean leader Kim Jong Un  to give up his nuclear weapons program.
[01:50.32]China has emphasized maintaining stability in the area and negotiations.
[01:57.68]However, China may be signaling that its approach to North Korea has not been working.
[02:06.40]It may be agreeing that stronger measures are needed.
[02:11.52]North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006.
[02:18.36]It has claimed to have carried out four nuclear tests and a number of long-range rocket launches.
[02:27.80]In addition to a U.N. arms embargo,
[02:31.36]North Korea is banned from importing and exporting nuclear and missile technology.
[02:39.28]It also is banned from importing luxury goods.
[02:45.64]South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports that the proposed resolution will target
[02:52.60]North Korea's atomic energy and aerospace agencies.
[02:58.04]Some experts doubt that targeting North Korean officials and agencies will have any impact.
[03:06.56]They question whether the final agreement will impose real economic pain
[03:13.24]that will be felt by leader Kim Jong Un and the leadership.
[03:18.12]The U.S. has supported banning North Korean coal and other mineral exports.
[03:26.00]It has also supported barring oil trade and restricting North Korean access to international ports.
[03:34.40]The U.S. also wanted to increase restrictions on North Korean banks' access to the international financial system.
[03:46.72]Chinese and South Korean media reported this week that China has ordered a halt to its coal trade with North Korea.
[03:57.28]They say some Chinese banks have frozen accounts belonging to North Koreans.
[04:05.64]China's Foreign Ministry said it does not know of these developments.
[04:11.60]However, experts say there is increased popular support in China
[04:17.64]to cut off possible funding for North Korea's nuclear program.
[04:24.04]"China has been intensively discussing how to internally block oil and cash from flowing into North Korea,"
[04:34.28]said Woo Su-keun, a professor of international relations at Donghua University in Shanghai.
[04:43.00]There have been questions that China would be slow to reach agreement on U.N. sanctions.
[04:52.60]The U.S. and South Korea are considering the possible deployment
[04:58.20]of the controversial Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile defense system.
[05:08.28]China and Russia oppose THAAD deployment in Korea.
[05:13.16]They are concerned that it can possibly be used against their military forces in the area.
[05:21.60]This week, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Qiu Guohong,
[05:28.32]suggested China would cut ties with South Korea over THAAD deployment.
[05:35.85]South Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister, Kim Hong-kyun, criticized the Chinese ambassador
[05:45.12]for attempting to exert influence over a South Korean national security issue.
[05:52.48]President Obama recently signed legislation placing new U.S. sanctions on North Korea.
[06:01.24]The bill requires sanctions on anyone assisting North Korea in its nuclear and missile programs,
[06:09.72]cyber-attacks or human rights abuses.
[06:14.68]The expanded sanctions are designed to deny North Korea the money
[06:20.04]to develop miniaturized nuclear warheads and missiles to carry them.
[06:26.76]The measure also authorizes $50 million over five years for radio broadcasts into North Korea
[06:36.36]and to support humanitarian assistance programs.
