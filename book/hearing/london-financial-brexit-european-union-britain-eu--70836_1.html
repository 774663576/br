。
[00:00.72]Almost one-fourth of Britain's national income
[00:05.00]is earned in and around the city of London.
[00:09.32]Much of the money comes from international businesses based there.
[00:16.00]But the British vote to leave the European Union
[00:20.56]means London could lose its place as Europe's leading business center.
[00:27.24]As part of the European Union,  Britain has rights to sell its services
[00:33.24]without tariffs in many countries across the continent.
[00:37.88]The EU currently has 28 member states,
[00:43.29]and it serves a market of 500 million people.
[00:48.28]But when Britain officially leaves the bloc, London-based businesses
[00:53.36]will likely lose their tax-free access to the single EU market.
[00:59.52]As a result, some banks have already said
[01:04.24]they may move their operations to the European mainland.
[01:09.20]David Slater is with the company London &amp; Partners.
[01:14.96]Its goal is to strengthen London's image overseas
[01:19.16]and help London-based businesses work with foreign partners.
[01:24.36]Slater says the new government in Britain must negotiate
[01:29.68]for businesses to have continued access to the single market.
[01:34.84]But some European leaders say
[01:37.76]Britain cannot have special economic ties with the European Union
[01:42.76]without permitting freedom of movement.
[01:46.44]They say people from EU member states
[01:50.20]should have the right to come freely to Britain.
[01:53.80]Concern over immigration was the main issue
[01:58.30]that drove the "Leave" campaign to victory in Britain's Brexit vote.
[02:03.52]With the possibility that London will lose its special ties to the EU market,
[02:09.68]other cities are eyeing its position as Europe's leading financial center.
[02:16.24]The list of cities that want to replace London includes Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam.
[02:24.72]In France, government officials recently spoke of
[02:29.60]"rolling out the red carpet" to businesses fleeing Brexit.
[02:35.24]They promised to make taxes for French expatriates the most favorable in Europe.
[02:42.52]The word "expatriate" is used to describe people who live outside their home country.
[02:49.76]In Berlin, people see a chance to expand the city's technology industry.
[02:56.12]Berlin is already Europe's second biggest tech city after London.
[03:03.32]And, the prices for housing and offices are much less costly there.
[03:08.76]Lukas Kampfmann is with a business called Factory Berlin.
[03:15.48]The group is home to high-tech companies,
[03:18.56]including the music website Soundcloud.
[03:22.64]"With Brexit, London has more or less taken itself out of the race," Kampfmann said.
[03:30.32]"And we do believe that over time the advantage of Berlin will grow
[03:36.16]and more tech start-ups will come to Berlin."
[03:40.76]Then there is Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.
[03:44.84]The New York Times newspaper recently rated Amsterdam
[03:49.60]as best placed to steal London's position.
[03:53.80]The paper noted that Amsterdam has international connections,
[03:58.44]an English-speaking population and appeal for expatriates.
[04:04.68]But London's supporters still say their city will remain number one.
[04:10.52]David Slater of London &amp; Partners says the reason is
[04:14.80]because the businesspeople working in London want to stay there.
