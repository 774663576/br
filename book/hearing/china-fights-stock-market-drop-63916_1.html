[00:00.32]China's stock markets have lost nearly $3 trillion from their peak in June.
[00:06.76]As a result, the government has introduced new measures
[00:11.24]hoping to stop weeks of declining prices.
[00:16.12]In an effort to avoid further losses,
[00:19.28]hundreds of companies listed on China's stock exchanges
[00:24.00]filed papers to suspend trading.
[00:27.80]By Thursday, the stocks of more than 1,400 mainland companies had been suspended.
[00:35.56]That is about 40 percent of the market.
[00:40.60]China's Securities Regulatory Commission
[00:43.84]blamed the losses partly on a "panic sentiment" and "irrational selling."
[00:50.76]Chinese state media have blamed short-sellers,
[00:54.36]traders who profit from falling prices,
[00:57.72]people spreading rumors and foreign investors.
[01:01.88]The government then put in place a number of measures to calm the stock markets.
[01:09.68]The government agency that oversees the country's biggest state-run companies
[01:15.24]has told them not to sell shares.
[01:18.56]Instead, it told them to buy more to keep the market stable.
[01:24.16]The country's central bank
[01:26.64]promised to "offer (an) abundant liquidity supply for security brokers."
[01:32.44]That means it would make loans to stock traders, called brokers,
[01:37.32]to make sure they have enough money to carry out trades.
[01:42.40]Chinese officials also have lent $42 billion to brokerages to buy shares.
[01:49.52]And the government moved to permit insurance companies
[01:53.80]to invest larger amounts of money in stocks.
[01:57.72]How Chinese stocks rose in 2014
[01:59.21]China's stock markets rose in late 2014
[02:03.28]after the central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than two years.
[02:09.84]A new trading link between the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges
[02:15.40]added to increased market activity.
[02:19.52]Higher "margin trading," in which investors do not have to deposit
[02:24.84]the full cost of their stock trades
[02:27.64]in order to buy the shares, also fueled gains.
[02:32.32]In the twelve months before June 12 of this year,
[02:36.12]the total value of stocks traded on the Chinese market
[02:40.44]increased by more than 150 percent.
[02:44.52]But as the market peaked in early June,  the government tightened rules on margin trading.
[02:52.28]Investors then began to sell their holdings to protect their profits.
[02:57.80]Treasury Secretary Urges Market Reforms to Continue
[02:58.98]U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew
[03:02.20]spoke about China's answer to its stock market problems
[03:06.52]at the Brookings Institution in Washington last week.
[03:11.52]He said China's markets are not fully integrated into the world financial system.
[03:18.96]Mr. Lew says Chinese officials
[03:22.12]have a strong commitment to market reforms
[03:25.60]where they have clearly set out a plan.
[03:29.56]He said the speed at which the reforms are put in place remains a question.
[03:36.40]"The question isn't their commitment to the goal. The question is the pace at which they implement it and do they do it fast enough for it to be effective.
[03:43.96]I hope this is not something that slows down the pace of reform...
[03:47.72]They've got a set of policies that they've outlined
[03:51.28]which, if they implement them, I think will make China's economy much stronger in the future."
[03:56.93]Mr. Lew said China is moving from a centralized, industrial economy
[04:02.84]to a more market-based economy powered by consumer spending.
[04:09.00]This, he said, would lead to slower more sustainable growth and improve the lives of the Chinese people
[04:17.68]while lifting the world economy. He warned of slowing the reform process.
[04:24.20]"If the reaction is to put the brakes on reforms, that will slow that process."
[04:29.48]Investors welcomed the government actions to stop the decline.
[04:35.00]On Friday, Chinese stock markets regained some of the losses from the past few weeks.
[04:42.28]However, stocks from many Chinese companies are still suspended from trading.
[04:49.28]Other investors believe prices may fall again once the suspended shares resume trading.
[04:58.00]In a report on Friday, Bank of America wrote that the stock market crash
[05:03.60]would hit the Chinese economy in time
[05:07.08]and "will likely hurt consumption down the road."
