波士顿学院大学的菲利普·兰德里根告诉美联社，需要对这个问题进行更多的研究。兰德里根在《华尔街日报》上撰文谈到了这项研究，他说这是第一个表明微塑料和纳米塑料与人类疾病之间存在联系的研究。其他科学家已经在肺、肝、血液、胎盘和母乳中发现了塑料碎片。</p>

。
[00:00.04]A new study examines possible harm
[00:04.00]caused by microscopic pieces of plastic
[00:08.16]that end up inside people's bodies.
[00:11.56]These materials – known as microplastics
[00:16.32]and nanoplastics – can enter the body
[00:20.16]through the air or in food or drinks.
[00:24.04]Tiny plastic pieces have received
[00:27.68]widespread attention in the media.
[00:30.60]But so far, very little research has been done
[00:35.16]on how the substances affect human heart health.
[00:40.12]One new study suggests the buildup
[00:43.68]of such plastics inside the body
[00:46.76]can increase the risk of a stroke,
[00:49.52]heart attack or death.
[00:51.96]But the researchers noted the evidence presented
[00:56.20]cannot prove a direct link
[00:58.88]between tiny plastic materials
[01:01.92]and heart problems.
[01:04.36]The study involved 257 people
[01:09.36]who had medical operations
[01:12.04]to clear blocked blood vessels in their necks.
[01:16.20]Italian researchers examined the fatty buildup
[01:20.68]the doctors removed from the carotid arteries,
[01:24.80]which supply blood and oxygen to the brain.
[01:29.32]Using two methods, they found evidence of plastics
[01:34.40]– mostly nanoplastics that cannot be seen
[01:38.12]– in the artery plaque of 150 patients.
[01:42.64]No evidence of plastics was seen in 107 patients.
[01:49.20]The team followed these people for three years.
[01:53.80]During that time, 30 individuals,
[01:57.08]or 20 percent of the group with plastics,
[02:00.76]had a heart attack, stroke, or died from any cause.
[02:05.68]These rates dropped to about eight percent
[02:09.56]among those with no evidence of plastics.
[02:13.20]Research results were recently published
[02:17.08]in a study in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[02:21.08]The researchers also found more evidence of inflammation
[02:26.60]in individuals with tiny plastic bits in their blood.
[02:31.16]Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury
[02:35.76]and is thought to raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
[02:40.56]The researchers admitted their study was very small.
[02:45.92]For example, it only looked at people with narrowed arteries
[02:51.24]who were already at risk for heart attacks and stroke.
[02:55.60]And the patients with the plastics had more heart disease,
[03:00.96]diabetes and high cholesterol
[03:03.92]than those without plastics.
[03:06.60]They were also more likely to be men
[03:09.76]and more likely to be smokers.
[03:12.60]Both of those groups generally
[03:15.52]have higher rates of heart disease.
[03:18.20]The researchers tried to account
[03:21.52]for these risk differences.
[03:24.12]But they noted they may have missed
[03:27.24]some important elements
[03:29.16]that could change the results.
[03:31.96]The team said because of these ongoing questions,
[03:36.00]this kind of study cannot prove the plastics
[03:40.00]caused the health problems.
[03:42.60]Steve Nissen is a heart expert
[03:46.28]at the Cleveland Clinic in the state of Ohio
[03:49.60]who was not part of the study.
[03:52.36]He told the Associated Press
[03:55.68]he thinks the team's estimate
[03:58.24]that the risk of heart attack, stroke or death
[04:02.00]was four times greater seems too high.
[04:06.12]"It would mean that these microplastics
[04:09.88]are the most important cause
[04:11.72]of coronary heart disease yet discovered.
[04:15.88]And I just don't think that's likely to be right," Nissen said.
[04:21.76]Philip Landrigan of Boston College University
[04:26.44]told the AP that more research is needed on the issue.
[04:31.88]Landrigan, who wrote about the study in the Journal,
[04:36.12]said it is the first one suggesting
[04:39.24]a connection between microplastics
[04:42.08]and nanoplastics with disease in humans.
[04:46.56]Other scientists have found plastic bits in the lungs,
[04:51.76]liver, blood, placenta and breast milk.
[04:56.36]"It does not prove cause and effect,
[05:00.00]but it suggests cause and effect," Landrigan said.
[05:05.08]"And it needs urgently to be either replicated
[05:09.44]or disproven by other studies
[05:12.44]done by other investigators in other populations."
[05:17.40]The Cleveland Clinic's Nissen added about the study,
[05:22.00]"It's a wake-up call that perhaps we need
[05:25.28]to take the problem of microplastics more seriously.
[05:30.12]As a cause for heart disease? Not proven.
[05:34.48]As a potential cause? Yes, maybe," Nissen said.
