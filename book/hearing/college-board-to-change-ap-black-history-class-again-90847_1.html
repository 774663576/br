<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:College Board to Change AP Black History Class Again]

。
[00:00.04]The College Board is changing its new Advanced Placement
[00:04.84](AP) African American studies course again.
[00:09.36]Over the winter, the AP made changes to the course
[00:14.24]that critics said were made because of political pressure.
[00:20.88]AP courses are college-level classes
[00:24.60]that give high school students the chance to earn college credit.
[00:30.44]The non-profit group College Board writes the AP courses.
[00:35.52]It is promising to give students an
[00:38.36]"unflinching encounter with the facts"
[00:41.32]in the Black studies course.
[00:44.92]The announcement follows criticism
[00:47.52]that the course did not include
[00:50.16]the full truth about slavery reparations,
[00:53.68]the Black Lives Matter movement
[00:56.04]and other issues after pressure from conservative politicians.
[01:02.76]The non-profit group did not say what the changes will be
[01:07.24]or when they will be made public.
[01:10.44]In a statement April 24,
[01:13.08]it said that the group's experts will decide
[01:16.68]the details of those changes over the next few months.
[01:23.52]The new AP course has gained national attention in recent months.
[01:30.56]Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,
[01:33.44]a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024,
[01:38.12]said he would ban the curriculum in his state
[01:41.68]because he believed it pushed a liberal position.
[01:46.92]The official curriculum for the course was released
[01:50.72]after DeSantis' administration announced a statewide ban.
[01:56.28]The curriculum downplayed some topics
[01:59.64]that had drawn objections
[02:01.40]from the governor and other conservatives.
[02:05.32]The College Board faced strong criticism
[02:08.52]from activists and others who were angered that the course
[02:13.16]may have been changed because of politics.
[02:17.80]Critics said the College Board took out subjects
[02:21.72]including slavery reparations
[02:24.60]and Black queer studies because of political pressure.
[02:30.88]David Johns is director of the National Black Justice Coalition.
[02:36.72]He said he thinks the College Board's latest announcement
[02:41.52]is an admission that it watered down the course because of politics.
[02:47.92]To water down means to make something less forceful or effective.
[02:53.88]"We cannot, and will not,
[02:56.32]let the politics of fear and division
[02:59.96]dictate what our children are taught," Johns said.
[03:05.72]In the 2022-2023 school year,
[03:10.20]the course was launched in 60 schools.
[03:14.28]For the upcoming school year,
[03:16.16]it will expand to reach 16,000 students across 800 schools.
[03:23.56]David Canton is a history professor
[03:27.16]and the director of the University of Florida's
[03:30.96]African American Studies program.
[03:34.48]He said the College Board does the best it can
[03:38.40]to take coursework from colleges around the country
[03:42.48]and create a single curriculum.
[03:46.80]"This course is not required
[03:49.08]so (high school) students make the choice,"
[03:52.04]he said of the AP class.
[03:55.48]"If students are interested ...
[03:57.72]why don't we allow students to decide
[04:00.88]if they want to take the course —
[04:03.32]and not the Department of Education?"
[04:08.04]If Florida does not permit
[04:10.48]high school students to take the AP class,
[04:13.48]Canton said there are fears
[04:16.52]that other conservative states might do the same.
[04:21.68]The College Board previously said changes to the course
[04:25.96]were made before DeSantis shared his objections.
[04:31.24]College Board officials said it worked with professors
[04:35.56]from more than 200 colleges,
[04:38.16]including several historically Black colleges, in writing the course.
[04:45.08]The College Board said that the course
[04:48.08]gives students a chance to study a subject
[04:51.64]that is not widely available to all high schoolers.
[04:56.76]It also said it hoped to offer the course
[04:59.96]to as many students as possible.
[05:03.96]However, the nonprofit testing company said,
[05:07.68]those two goals "came into conflict."
[05:11.72]I'm Dan Novak.
