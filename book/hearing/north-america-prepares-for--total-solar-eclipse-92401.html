。
[00:00.04]A total solar eclipse will take place
[00:03.64]in North America on April 8.
[00:07.04]Millions of people will be able to
[00:10.20]fully experience the event,
[00:12.76]which is expected to darken the sky
[00:16.24]for more than four minutes.
[00:18.60]A total solar eclipse happens when the sun,
[00:23.04]moon and Earth perfectly line up.
[00:26.40]This results in sunlight being blocked.
[00:30.44]The quality of the observations
[00:33.16]will depend on weather
[00:35.12]and the position where people watch the eclipse from.
[00:39.60]The path of totality –
[00:42.60]meaning places where people will see
[00:45.24]a total blockage of the sun –
[00:47.92]will stretch across areas of Mexico,
[00:51.40]the United States and Canada.
[00:54.36]People in North America who are outside of this path
[00:59.64]will still be able to see a partial eclipse.
[01:03.44]The American space agency NASA
[01:07.44]says the eclipse will begin over the South Pacific
[01:11.60]and reach Mexico's Pacific coast
[01:15.08]at around 11:07 a.m. Pacific Time.
[01:19.60]It will then enter the United States in Texas.
[01:24.28]The path of totality
[01:26.80]will then pass through a series of states
[01:29.92]before heading out from the northernmost state of Maine.
[01:34.68]The eclipse will enter Canada in Ontario
[01:38.72]and move across the nation
[01:40.96]before leaving northeastern Canada into the Atlantic.
[01:45.88]An estimated 44 million people
[01:49.56]live inside the 185-kilometer-wide
[01:54.20]path of totality, with about 32 million in the U.S.
[01:59.88]The eclipse is expected to last
[02:03.40]four minutes and 28 seconds,
[02:05.72]about twice as long as
[02:07.96]the one that darkened skies in 2017.
[02:11.72]The U.S. is not set to see another
[02:15.24]coast-to-coast total solar eclipse until 2045.
[02:21.24]NASA's eclipse watch program is led by Kelly Korreck.
[02:27.16]She told The Associated Press
[02:30.04]the eclipse will permit many people
[02:33.16]to experience the "wonder of the universe
[02:36.88]without going very far."
[02:39.44]People outside the path of totality
[02:42.92]will still be able to see a partial eclipse.
[02:46.84]The farther these people are from the path,
[02:50.24]the less the sun will be covered.
[02:52.68]For example, experts say Americans
[02:56.72]farthest from this path –
[02:59.12]such as in the northwestern cities of Seattle and Portland –
[03:03.80]will see about one-third of the sun blocked.
[03:07.24]As was the case with past eclipse events,
[03:11.36]people are being warned about the dangers of looking
[03:15.20]directly at the sun during the event.
[03:18.88]Since normal sunglasses are not
[03:22.28]considered effective protection,
[03:24.72]special eclipse glasses are suggested for eclipse watchers.
[03:30.56]The glasses should only be removed
[03:33.60]during moments when the sun's face
[03:36.16]is covered during complete totality.
[03:39.64]A total solar eclipse develops
[03:42.64]in several different parts, or stages.
[03:46.56]The event starts with a partial eclipse
[03:49.92]as the moon begins to pass between Earth and the sun.
[03:54.52]During this stage, a partial blockage
[03:58.12]leaves the sun looking a bit like a banana.
[04:01.80]During the next stage, called Baily's Beads,
[04:06.00]points of light from the sun
[04:08.40]shine around the moon's edges.
[04:11.00]This effect is produced
[04:13.48]by the moon's differing landscapes.
[04:16.00]NASA notes this stage is quite short
[04:20.28]and "may not last long enough to be noticeable
[04:24.12]to all observers of the total solar eclipse."
[04:28.36]In the Diamond Ring stage,
[04:31.24]a single bright spot appears along the lunar edge
[04:35.52]even as the sun's atmosphere leaves
[04:38.28]a ring of light around the moon.
[04:41.56]This effect – which comes right before totality –
[04:45.64]looks similar to a diamond ring.
[04:48.48]After totality, the other stages then repeat
[04:53.32]as the moon keeps moving along its path
[04:56.48]until the end of the eclipse.
[04:58.96]Total solar eclipses generally happen every few years,
[05:03.76]often in the middle of nowhere
[05:06.24]like the South Pacific or Antarctic.
[05:09.92]The next total solar eclipse will arrive in 2026.
[05:15.72]It will be observable along the northern edges
[05:19.28]of Greenland, Iceland and Spain.
[05:23.08]North America will not experience totality again
[05:27.52]until 2033, with that one only passing over Alaska.
[05:33.60]It will happen next in 2044,
[05:36.72]with totality limited to Western Canada
[05:40.56]and the U.S. states of Montana and North Dakota.
[05:45.04]The next coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in the U.S.
[05:50.32]is expected to happen in 2045.
[05:54.16]NASA says that one will stretch from Northern California
[05:59.64]to Cape Canaveral, Florida.
