。
[00:00.04]In 1781, German-born British astronomer
[00:05.40]William Herschel made Uranus
[00:08.60]the first planet discovered with a telescope.
[00:13.60]But, 243 years later,
[00:17.36]we still do not know much about this cold planet,
[00:22.28]the third largest in our solar system.
[00:26.72]And some of what we thought we knew about it
[00:30.40]turns out to be untrue.
[00:34.28]Much of the knowledge about Uranus
[00:36.68]was collected when NASA's robotic spacecraft Voyager 2
[00:42.40]flew past it in 1986.
[00:46.88]But scientists have since learned
[00:49.60]that the craft visited at a time of unusual conditions.
[00:55.28]An intense solar wind event at the time
[00:59.00]led to misleading observations about Uranus,
[01:03.20]and especially its magnetic field.
[01:08.24]The solar wind is a high-speed flow
[01:11.48]of charged particles coming from the sun.
[01:16.24]The researchers took a second look
[01:19.08]at eight months of data from around the time
[01:22.84]of Voyager 2's visit and found that it flew near Uranus
[01:29.32]just a few days after the solar wind
[01:33.68]had reduced the planet's magnetosphere
[01:37.40]to about 20 percent of its usual size.
[01:42.72]A magnetosphere is an area of space
[01:46.48]surrounding a planet that is controlled
[01:49.76]by the planet's magnetic field.
[01:52.96]The magnetosphere protects the planet
[01:56.00]from solar and cosmic particle radiation.
[02:01.24]The Voyager 2 observations
[02:03.96]led scientists to think Uranus' magnetosphere
[02:08.52]lacked in plasma and had very intense belts
[02:13.08]of highly energetic electrons.
[02:17.24]Plasma is often called the fourth state of matter
[02:21.76]after solids, liquids and gases.
[02:26.64]In the night sky, plasma gives out light
[02:30.32]in the form of stars, nebulas,
[02:33.96]and even the auroras
[02:36.32]above the north and south poles.
[02:40.52]Plasma is a common feature
[02:43.20]in the magnetosphere of other planets,
[02:46.08]so scientists did not understand
[02:49.88]why there would not be much of it
[02:52.08]observed around Uranus.
[02:55.80]Jamie Jasinski studies space plasma
[02:59.52]at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[03:02.84]He is the lead writer of the study published recently
[03:07.56]in the publication Nature Astronomy.
[03:11.56]"We found that the solar wind conditions
[03:14.72]present during the flyby
[03:16.92]only occur 4 percent of the time.
[03:21.48]The flyby occurred during the maximum
[03:25.12]peak solar wind intensity
[03:27.72]in that entire eight-month period," Jasinski said.
[03:32.84]"We would have observed
[03:34.20]a much bigger magnetosphere
[03:36.48]if Voyager 2 had arrived a week earlier."
[03:42.08]Such a visit would likely have shown
[03:45.08]that the Uranus magnetosphere
[03:47.56]is like those of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune,
[03:52.12]the solar system's other large planets,
[03:55.68]the researchers said.
[03:58.64]Uranus looks blue green
[04:01.52]because of the methane
[04:03.08]contained in its atmosphere.
[04:06.12]The planet is big enough to fit 63 Earths inside it.
[04:12.12]Among the solar system's eight planets,
[04:15.12]only Jupiter and Saturn are larger.
[04:20.28]Uranus orbits almost 20 times
[04:23.32]further from the sun than Earth does.
[04:27.24]And it has 28 known moons and two sets of rings.
[04:33.92]Data collected by Voyager 2 had suggested
[04:37.92]that its two largest moons - Titania and Oberon
[04:42.64]- often orbit outside the magnetosphere.
[04:46.52]But the new study shows that they usually
[04:50.68]stay inside the protective space,
[04:53.60]making it easier for scientists to magnetically detect
[04:58.48]possible subsurface oceans.
[05:02.88]"Both are thought to be prime candidates
[05:05.64]for hosting liquid water oceans in the Uranian system...,"
[05:10.16]Jet Propulsion Laboratory planetary scientist
[05:13.96]and study co-writer Corey Cochrane said.
[05:19.40]Scientists want to learn
[05:21.56]whether subsurface oceans on moons
[05:25.08]in the outer solar system
[05:27.36]have conditions that could support life.
[05:30.88]So, on October 14,
[05:34.56]NASA launched a spacecraft
[05:37.24]on a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa
[05:40.76]to try to answer that question.
[05:44.56]"A future mission to Uranus is crucial
[05:48.04]to understanding not only the planet and magnetosphere,
[05:53.28]but also its atmosphere, rings and moons," Jasinski said.
