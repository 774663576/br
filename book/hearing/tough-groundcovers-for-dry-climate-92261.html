<p>White evening primrose, Oenothera caespitosa, is usually covered in blooms from spring through summer. But they are only open from late <strong>afternoon</strong> into morning. The white blossoms develop to light pink, and then darken to deep pinkish-purple. The plant has moderate water needs and performs best in full sun to part shade.</p>
<p><strong>Best time to plant</strong></p>
<p>Early spring is the best time to plant these groundcovers in desert climates.</p>
<p>Gently loosen the soil to about 30 centimeters deep, removing stones and other hard material to permit a clear path for roots. Give some space between the plants. Add mulch or wood chips to keep soil temperature even, prevent weeds, and help hold water.</p>
<p>The best time of day to water the groundcovers is in the morning. To avoid root <strong>rot</strong>, water the groundcover only when, and as soon as, the soil is completely dry.</p>

。
[00:00.04]Trying to grow grass in the deserts
[00:03.60]or other dry places
[00:06.04]can seem like a losing battle.
[00:09.92]As a result, many people who live in such climates
[00:14.16]will use rocks, gravel, or man-made materials
[00:19.08]as groundcover instead of grass.
[00:23.64]But there are several tough,
[00:26.16]low-growing groundcovers
[00:28.64]that perform well in dry climates.
[00:32.92]They may not be able to survive the foot traffic
[00:36.76]that fake grass can.
[00:39.40]But they appeal to environmentally helpful insects
[00:44.36]and in many cases make your property look better.
[00:50.32]Desert marigold, or Baileya multiradiata,
[00:54.80]is one such plant.
[00:57.76]The groundcover has pretty yellow blossoms
[01:01.44]and silver leaves.
[01:04.16]They bloom in the spring.
[01:06.72]The plant requires very little water.
[01:11.16]However, it lives only one season.
[01:15.76]People who want desert marigold
[01:18.12]must plant it every year.
[01:22.12]Gold Mound lantana, known as Lantana camara,
[01:26.92]is a bushy plant usually just over a half-meter tall.
[01:33.24]Its yellow flowers bloom on and off
[01:36.44]from spring through autumn
[01:39.12]and it has low to moderate water needs.
[01:44.20]Its relative, trailing lantana,
[01:47.72]or Lantana montevidensis, grows horizontally.
[01:53.96]Its purple blossoms brighten the garden year-round.
[01:59.76]The groundcover has moderate water needs.
[02:03.52]It favors full sunlight but can survive partial sunlight.
[02:11.04]Trailing indigo, or Dalea greggii,
[02:14.96]is another groundcover
[02:16.96]that grows well in dry climates.
[02:20.64]The long-lived plant has blue-gray leaves
[02:24.44]and pink or purple pea-shaped flowers.
[02:29.28]It blooms from spring through summer
[02:32.32]in full or partial sunlight.
[02:35.84]The plant, which can spread to three meters wide,
[02:40.20]has very low water needs
[02:42.72]but could use some watering while in bloom.
[02:47.68]Silverbush, also known as Convolvulus cneorum,
[02:52.76]is a fast-growing evergreen that, in the desert,
[02:57.04]blooms for about two weeks in spring.
[03:01.72]The 60-centimeter-tall plant
[03:04.32]has yellow-centered white flowers
[03:07.44]with silver leaves.
[03:10.28]White evening primrose, Oenothera caespitosa,
[03:15.40]is usually covered in blooms
[03:18.20]from spring through summer.
[03:21.24]But they are only open
[03:23.48]from late afternoon into morning.
[03:27.40]The white blossoms develop to light pink,
[03:31.24]and then darken to deep pinkish-purple.
[03:35.60]The plant has moderate water needs
[03:38.52]and performs best in full sun to part shade.
[03:44.60]Early spring is the best time
[03:47.24]to plant these groundcovers in desert climates.
[03:51.84]Gently loosen the soil
[03:53.84]to about 30 centimeters deep,
[03:57.00]removing stones and other hard material
[04:00.80]to permit a clear path for roots.
[04:05.24]Give some space between the plants.
[04:08.28]Add mulch or wood chips
[04:11.08]to keep soil temperature even,
[04:13.64]prevent weeds, and help hold water.
[04:18.20]The best time of day to water the groundcovers
[04:21.60]is in the morning.
[04:23.32]To avoid root rot,
[04:26.00]water the groundcover only when,
[04:29.16]and as soon as, the soil is completely dry.
