。
[00:00.04]Our very ancient animal ancestors had tails.
[00:06.08]Why don't we have them now?
[00:09.20]From the time of Charles Darwin,
[00:12.92]a scientist from the 1800s
[00:16.56]who studied evolutionary biology,
[00:20.60]scientists have questioned
[00:23.20]why and how this happened.
[00:26.84]The answer is somewhere around 20 million
[00:31.04]or 25 million years ago.
[00:35.00]That was the time apes,
[00:37.24]the group of animals humans are part of,
[00:41.12]split from another animal group, monkeys.
[00:46.12]During that split,
[00:48.08]our branch of the tree of life lost its tail.
[00:53.96]Now, scientists have identified
[00:57.68]at least one of the genetic differences
[01:01.40]that led to this change.
[01:04.40]"We found a single mutation
[01:07.12]in a very important gene," said Bo Xia.
[01:12.84]He is a geneticist at the Broad Institute
[01:17.88]and helped write the study
[01:20.44]recently released in the publication Nature.
[01:26.16]The researchers compared the genomes
[01:29.28]of six kinds of apes, including humans,
[01:33.64]and 15 kinds of monkeys with tails
[01:38.04]to find important differences between the groups.
[01:43.92]Once they identified an important mutation,
[01:48.60]they tested their theory
[01:50.72]by using the gene-editing tool CRISPR.
[01:55.64]They used it to change the same place
[01:58.48]in embryos of an animal
[02:01.28]often used in laboratories, mice.
[02:06.00]Those mice were born without tails.
[02:10.28]Xia said, however,
[02:12.68]that other genetic changes
[02:15.44]may also play a part in losing tails.
[02:20.44]Another mystery: Did having no tails
[02:24.32]help these ape ancestors
[02:27.20]– and eventually, humans – survive?
[02:32.08]Or was it just a chance mutation
[02:35.44]in a population that survived for other reasons?
[02:41.36]"It could be random chance,
[02:43.64]but it could have brought a big evolutionary advantage,"
[02:48.32]said Miriam Konkel.
[02:52.16]She is an evolutionary geneticist
[02:55.76]at Clemson University,
[02:58.64]who was not involved in the study.
[03:02.64]As to why having no tails
[03:05.08]may have helped our ancestors,
[03:07.64]there are many interesting theories.
[03:11.60]They include some that link being tailless
[03:15.32]to learning to walk upright.
[03:18.76]Rick Potts directs the Human Origins Project
[03:22.88]of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
[03:29.88]He was not involved in the research.
[03:33.24]Potts suggests being tailless
[03:37.04]may have been a first step
[03:39.08]toward some apes standing upright,
[03:42.16]even before they left the trees.
[03:46.24]Not all apes live on the ground today.
[03:50.36]Orangutans and gibbons are tailless apes
[03:54.48]that still live in trees.
[03:58.00]But Potts notes that they move
[04:00.52]very differently than monkeys,
[04:03.00]who move along the tops of branches,
[04:06.16]using their tails for balance.
[04:10.08]Those apes hang below branches,
[04:12.92]holding onto the branches with their arms
[04:16.60]while hanging largely upright.
[04:20.80]New York University biologist Itai Yanai
[04:25.52]helped write the study.
[04:28.68]He said that losing our tails
[04:30.96]was clearly a large change.
[04:34.88]But the only way to truly know the reason
[04:38.44]"would be to invent a time machine," he said.
