。
[00:00.04]A World Health Organization (WHO) official
[00:04.32]who recently returned from the Gaza Strip said recently
[00:09.00]that the health care system is collapsing.
[00:11.92]He said more workers and supplies are needed.
[00:17.16]WHO Health Emergency Officer Sean Casey
[00:21.16]told reporters at the United Nations:
[00:24.04]"I've seen the health care system
[00:26.48]collapsing before my eyes."
[00:29.36]Casey spent five weeks in Gaza, starting in early December.
[00:34.48]While there, he met with medical professionals
[00:37.96]and patients across the territory.
[00:41.76]"I saw patients in hospitals every day with severe burns,
[00:46.12]with open fractures, waiting hours or days for care,
[00:50.76]and they would often ask me for food and water," he said.
[00:56.60]Casey said a cease-fire is needed.
[00:59.72]But he also said the ability to move people
[01:02.84]and aid supplies safely and quickly within Gaza
[01:07.00]would help ease suffering.
[01:10.08]Reports say Gaza had a strong health care system
[01:14.20]with 36 hospitals and 25,000 doctors, nurses and specialists
[01:21.00]before Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7.
[01:26.24]Now, the WHO says, about 15 hospitals
[01:30.48]are partially operating.
[01:32.40]That makes getting care difficult
[01:35.12]for the more than 50,000 injured people.
[01:39.84]Casey said there is a shortage of supplies
[01:43.16]but also of workers.
[01:46.04]Many of them are displaced and struggling to survive
[01:50.36]and care for their own families.
[01:53.96]"There are unbelievably brave health workers across Gaza
[01:58.08]who are staying and taking care of people
[02:01.36]because there is no one else to do it," he said.
[02:05.52]Casey was in Gaza to see how to
[02:07.88]bring in more international medical teams.
[02:11.64]He said getting supplies to northern Gaza
[02:14.60]is especially difficult.
[02:16.40]During the five weeks that he was there,
[02:19.24]his team was unable to provide supplies
[02:22.24]to the largest hospital in the north,
[02:24.68]al-Shifa, for 12 straight days.
[02:28.84]At Al-Ahli hospital, also in the north,
[02:32.12]Casey said the situation was very bad.
[02:36.32]"I saw patients who were lying on church pews,
[02:39.76]basically waiting to die in a hospital
[02:42.60]that had no fuel, no power, no water,
[02:46.28]very little in the way of medical supplies," he said.
[02:51.16]Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid supplies.
[02:55.32]Casey said he had not seen evidence
[02:57.96]of that during his hospital visits.
[03:01.28]"I have no evidence of supplies
[03:03.48]that have been delivered to hospitals going anywhere
[03:06.72]except to those hospitals," he said.
[03:10.48]Dr. Seema Jilani is an emergency health expert
[03:14.52]with the International Rescue Committee.
[03:17.16]She returned recently from a two-week visit to Gaza
[03:21.60]with five British doctors.
[03:24.60]Jilani is a children's doctor
[03:27.00]who has worked in conflict areas
[03:29.44]including Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon.
[03:33.80]She said, "In my experience
[03:36.00]of working in conflict zones around the world,
[03:39.48]this is the most extreme situation I have seen
[03:42.84]in terms of scale, severity of injuries,
[03:46.56]number of children that have suffered
[03:48.60]that have nothing to do with any of this."
[03:52.24]Jilani worked in the emergency room
[03:54.68]at Al-Aksa Hospital in Deir al-Balah,
[03:58.68]the only hospital in the middle area of Gaza.
[04:02.20]Jilani said she treated children
[04:04.60]who had lost arms and legs
[04:06.88]and who had extreme burns.
[04:09.80]After she left, Jilani said,
[04:12.52]the hospital ran out of fuel and the lights went out.
[04:16.68]She does not know what has happened
[04:18.88]to the babies she treated
[04:20.88]or whether they have been moved to a safer place.
