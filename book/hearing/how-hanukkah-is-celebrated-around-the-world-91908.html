。
[00:00.04]Hanukkah is Judaism's "festival of lights."
[00:06.60]On eight straight nights, Jews come together
[00:11.04]with family and friends at the end of daylight
[00:15.44]to light one additional candle in the menorah.
[00:20.80]A menorah is a lamp or candle holder
[00:24.68]used in Jewish religious ceremonies.
[00:28.68]It usually has eight branches,
[00:32.16]with a ninth place for the candle called shamash
[00:36.60]from which all the others are lit.
[00:41.52]In Hebrew, Hanukkah means "dedication."
[00:46.80]The holiday marks the rededication
[00:49.92]of the Temple in Jerusalem about 2500 years ago.
[00:56.36]That was the time a small group of Jewish fighters
[01:00.72]took it back from occupying foreign forces.
[01:05.52]The fighters found a very small supply of oil
[01:09.64]in the religious building, or temple,
[01:12.96]and used it to keep a menorah lit for eight days.
[01:19.08]Their practice of lighting a nightly candle
[01:23.16]and cooking foods like potato pancakes
[01:27.12]called latkes, serve to remember the event.
[01:31.76]The dates of the holiday
[01:33.72]are based on the Hebrew month of Kislev,
[01:37.40]which usually falls sometime in November
[01:41.56]or December in the Gregorian calendar.
[01:45.88]This year, Hanukkah is being celebrated
[01:49.68]from December 7 through December 15.
[01:55.24]There are different branches of Judaism,
[01:58.48]like Reform, Conservative and Orthodox.
[02:03.24]But they all celebrate the holiday
[02:07.20]by bringing light into the darkness
[02:10.84]and remembering that even a small
[02:14.80]and unlikely-to-succeed effort
[02:18.52]can make great change.
[02:21.84]The Talmud is Judaism's central religious book.
[02:27.12]Within it, there is a dispute
[02:30.36]over the order of lighting.
[02:33.52]But even with that dispute,
[02:36.64]most start with one candle
[02:39.96]and increase the lighting
[02:42.24]by one more candle each night
[02:45.44]while saying religious blessings.
[02:49.32]The candles are added from right to left,
[02:52.96]but lit from left to right on the menorah,
[02:57.24]thus always starting with the newest light.
[03:02.36]The tradition calls for candles with a real flame.
[03:07.20]But some also use electric ones in public areas,
[03:12.68]such as in hospitals, for safety reasons.
[03:17.36]A menorah is lit in each household
[03:21.64]and traditionallyis placed
[03:24.76]where it can be seen from the outside,
[03:28.20]such as a doorway or near a window.
[03:32.92]It represents the spreading of God's light to all nations.
[03:39.44]The lighting of menorahs in city streets
[03:42.72]and public areas, like parks or areas of interest,
[03:48.24]has become more common in recent years
[03:51.88]in countries around the world.
[03:55.52]In addition to menorah lightings,
[03:58.72]giving money to those in need and social works
[04:03.76]are also part of the celebration for many.
[04:07.80]This comes out of the belief
[04:11.08]that the Jewish people are called by God
[04:14.80]to help make the world better for all.
