<p>His team gave three patients a <strong>dose</strong> of the drug Aduhelm each month for six months.

[00:00.04]Researchers recently said a new tool
[00:03.04]that uses what is called focused ultrasound
[00:07.20]can help deliver important medicine
[00:09.96]to the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
[00:13.68]Alzheimer's is a disease
[00:16.24]that slowly reduces the brain function of patients,
[00:19.92]causing confusion and other problems.
[00:23.92]The new delivery method helps drugs
[00:27.08]remove the brain-clogging plaque
[00:29.68]the disease is known for.
[00:33.36]The small sound waves created by the ultrasound tool
[00:37.60]create openings in what is called the blood-brain barrier.
[00:43.44]It is the protective lining in blood vessels
[00:48.36]that prevents bacteria and other damaging substances
[00:52.96]from getting into the brain.
[00:55.84]However, the barrier also prevents
[00:59.48]Alzheimer's medication from getting into the brain.
[01:03.84]The new technique permits the medicine to get
[01:07.20]into the brain more easily and remove the plaque faster.
[01:11.52]So far, the tool has been used on only three patients.
[01:18.16]Each patient saw a faster removal of plaque
[01:22.44]than with a traditional treatment.
[01:25.88]Dr. Ali Rezai of West Virginia University's
[01:29.84]Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute led the study.
[01:34.32]"Our goal is to give patients a head start," he said.
[01:38.56]Some of the new Alzheimer's treatments
[01:41.60]take a long time to work, he explained.
[01:45.28]But with the ultrasound tool,
[01:47.72]the drugs move into the brain faster.
[01:51.28]The medicine delivery requires three steps.
[01:54.72]First, doctors inject tiny bubbles into the bloodstream.
[01:59.88]Then patients put on a special head covering
[02:03.60]that permits doctors to send sound waves
[02:07.16]to an exact area of the brain.
[02:10.72]The waves vibrate the bubbles
[02:13.60]which loosen the blood-brain barrier
[02:16.60]just enough for the drug to get in.
[02:20.56]Before Rezai's study, other researchers
[02:24.00]discovered the ultrasound technique
[02:26.00]was able to make small openings in the barrier.
[02:30.16]The openings closed up after 48 hours.
[02:33.80]Rezai's experiment showed that the technique
[02:37.40]could be used to deliver medicine.
[02:40.92]Many of the recently approved Alzheimer's treatments
[02:44.00]take a long time to work.
[02:46.56]Patients must come for injections
[02:49.72]every few weeks for 18 months.
[02:53.20]The new treatment offers hope
[02:55.16]that patients can get results faster.
[02:58.80]"Why not try to clear the plaques
[03:01.04]within a few months," Rezai asked
[03:03.52]when discussing the reason behind his study.
[03:07.20]His team gave three patients
[03:10.36]a dose of the drug Aduhelm
[03:13.48]each month for six months.
[03:16.40]Right after each injection, his team aimed
[03:20.28]the focused ultrasound at part of the brain
[03:25.08]known to have the plaque build-up.
[03:27.88]As a result, more of the day's dose of the drug
[03:30.96]got through the blood-brain barrier.
[03:33.56]The team scanned the patients' brains
[03:36.64]before and after the treatment.
[03:39.24]After six months,
[03:41.16]scans showed a 32 percent reduction in plaque
[03:45.08]in the areas that were targeted,
[03:47.64]compared to areas that were not targeted.
[03:51.60]Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute
[03:55.00]on Aging was not involved in the research.
[03:58.92]Masliah said the trial brings some hope
[04:02.76]for Alzheimer's patients.
[04:04.72]However, he advised that larger trials are needed.
[04:10.16]"It's very exciting ... data," he said.
[04:12.92]"It opens the door for more extensive, larger studies."
[04:18.12]Masliah warned that one concern
[04:21.36]that must be investigated is whether
[04:23.24]the faster delivery of the drug will create side effects
[04:26.68]such as swelling and brain bleeding.
[04:30.60]Rezai said he is about to start a new study
[04:34.52]using another Alzheimer's drug called Leqembi.
[04:38.56]He added that larger studies would be needed
[04:42.20]to see if combining focused ultrasound
[04:45.88]with Alzheimer's drugs makes a real difference for patients.
[04:51.24]Other researchers may start studying
[04:53.56]whether the technique works for the treatment
[04:55.92]of other diseases that affect the brain, such as cancer.
