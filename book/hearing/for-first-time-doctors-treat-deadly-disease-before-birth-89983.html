<p>Ayla Bashir, a 16-month-old girl from Ottowa, Canada, is healthy after doctors used a new method to treat her before she was born. She has a rare genetic disease that killed two of her sisters.</p>

But a new <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2200587?query=featured_home">case study</a> describes the new treatment method that seems to be working for Ayla.</p>

<p>Pompe affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 newborns. It is caused by changes in a gene that makes an enzyme that breaks down glycogen, or stored sugar, in cells. When that enzyme is reduced or removed, glycogen builds up dangerously throughout the body.</p>

<p>Babies with Pompe disease have trouble feeding and experience muscle weakness. They often have very enlarged hearts.

<p>Ayla receives drugs for her immune system and weekly enzyme treatments that take five to six hours. Unless a new method is found, Ayla is likely to continue the treatments throughout her life.</p>

[00:01.48]Ayla Bashir, a 16-month-old girl from Ottowa, Canada,
[00:07.68]is healthy after doctors used a new method
[00:12.92]to treat her before she was born.
[00:16.96]She has a rare genetic disease that killed two of her sisters.
[00:24.28]The disease, called Pompe, causes the body to fail
[00:29.80]to make some or all of an important enzyme.
[00:35.32]But a new case study describes the new treatment method
[00:40.52]that seems to be working for Ayla.
[00:44.80]The young girl's parents recently told The Associated Press
[00:50.24]their daughter is now an active,
[00:53.20]happy girl who is growing normally.
[00:57.44]The couple previously lost two daughters, Zara, 2½,
[01:04.48]and Sara, 8 months, to the condition.
[01:08.84]A third pregnancy was ended
[01:12.04]because of the disease, or disorder.
[01:16.20]The future for Ayla is hopeful but uncertain.
[01:20.88]Dr. Karen Fung-Kee-Fung is a medicine specialist
[01:26.48]who works with fetuses at The Ottawa Hospital.
[01:31.44]She gave Ayla her treatments.
[01:34.96]The new method was developed by Dr. Tippi MacKenzie,
[01:40.80]co-director of the Center for Maternal-Fetal Precision Medicine
[01:47.04]at the University of California, San Francisco.
[01:52.56]MacKenzie shared her research with Fung-Kee-Fung.
[01:58.28]"We were all motivated to make this happen
[02:01.84]for this family," MacKenzie said.
[02:05.44]In this case, doctors delivered important enzymes
[02:10.20]to the mother through her stomach.
[02:13.60]The enzymes were then guided into the umbilical cord.
[02:20.76]Ayla received six treatments every two weeks,
[02:24.88]starting at about 24 weeks of fetal development.
[02:30.60]Dr. Pranesh Chakraborty has cared for Ayla's family for years.
[02:36.72]He told the AP that what made the treatment highly effective
[02:41.64]was completing it early, while the fetus was still developing.
[02:48.60]Pompe affects fewer than 1 in 100,000 newborns.
[02:54.56]It is caused by changes in a gene that makes an enzyme
[03:00.48]that breaks down glycogen, or stored sugar, in cells.
[03:07.44]When that enzyme is reduced or removed,
[03:12.48]glycogen builds up dangerously throughout the body.
[03:17.68]In addition, the most severely affected babies,
[03:22.84]including Ayla, have an immune condition
[03:27.08]in which their bodies block the treatment enzymes.
[03:31.88]This eventually stops the treatment from working.
[03:37.32]The hope is that Ayla's early treatment
[03:40.20]will reduce that immune response.
[03:44.16]Babies with Pompe disease have trouble feeding
[03:48.72]and experience muscle weakness.
[03:52.84]They often have very enlarged hearts.
[03:56.72]When left untreated,
[03:59.16]most babies die from heart or breathing problems
[04:03.56]during the first year of life.
[04:07.04]In addition to the girls who died, Ayla's parents
[04:11.24]have a 13-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter.
