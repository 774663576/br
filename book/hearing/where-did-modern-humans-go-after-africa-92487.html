。
[00:01.88]A new study offers an answer to the question
[00:05.08]of where early humans traveled after leaving Africa.
[00:10.52]Scientists say modern humans, or Homo sapiens,
[00:14.00]developed in Africa more than 300,000 years ago.
[00:19.56]Early humans then left Africa
[00:22.24]between 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
[00:26.96]Researchers said in a recently released study
[00:30.20]that these groups of hunter-gatherers
[00:33.16]appear to have stayed for thousands of years
[00:36.08]in an area of the Middle East.
[00:39.20]That area includes modern-day Iran,
[00:42.44]southeastern Iraq and northeastern Saudi Arabia.
[00:48.16]The early humans went on to settle all of Asia and Europe
[00:52.04]starting about 45,000 years ago.
[00:56.32]The scientists based their findings on genomic data
[01:00.08]taken from ancient DNA and from the genes of modern people.
[01:05.92]Scientists combined that data
[01:08.44]with paleoecological evidence.
[01:12.28]That is ancient evidence
[01:14.60]that suggests what the environment in these areas
[01:17.52]would have been like long ago.
[01:20.56]The evidence suggested the area in the Middle East
[01:23.88]would have been good for early humans.
[01:27.48]The researchers called this area a "hub" for these early people
[01:31.80]before they continued to more distant places.
[01:36.12]At the time, they numbered perhaps only in the thousands.
[01:41.12]The study was published
[01:42.48]in the scientific journal Nature Communications.
[01:46.68]Michael Petraglia is an anthropologist and a study co-author.
[01:52.64]He said the study "is a story about us and our history -
[01:56.64]our goal was to unravel some of the mystery about our evolution
[02:01.72]and our worldwide dispersal."
[02:05.56]"The combination of genetic and paleoecological models
[02:09.80]allowed us to predict the location
[02:12.44]where early human populations
[02:14.64]first" lived as soon as they left Africa, Petraglia added.
[02:21.00]These people lived in small groups
[02:23.00]of hunter-gatherers, the researchers said.
[02:26.72]The hub location offered several environmental settings,
[02:31.16]from forests to grasslands,
[02:34.08]changing over time between dry and wet periods.
[02:38.96]There would have been many resources available,
[02:41.96]with evidence showing the hunting of wild gazelle,
[02:45.24]sheep and goat, Petraglia said.
[02:49.04]They would have eaten "plants and small- to large-sized game.
[02:54.40]Hunter-gatherer groups
[02:56.12]seemed to have practiced a seasonal lifestyle,
[03:00.12]living in the lowlands in the cooler months
[03:02.88]and in the mountainous regions
[03:04.72]in the warmer months," Petraglia said.
[03:08.40]The people living in the hub at the time
[03:10.96]had dark skin and dark hair.
[03:14.16]Many might have looked like the Gumuz or Anuak people
[03:18.24]now living in parts of East Africa,
[03:21.16]said Luca Pagani, one of the study's writers.
[03:25.80]Later, they dispersed in different directions beyond the hub
[03:30.04]and the genetic differences developed between
[03:33.76]present-day East Asians and Europeans, the researchers said.
[03:39.84]The study used modern and ancient genomic data
[03:43.84]for European and Asian people.
[03:47.00]The researchers found a way to disentangle
[03:50.52]the extensive genetic mixing of populations
[03:53.76]that has taken place since then.
[03:57.04]There were earlier smaller dispersals of Homo sapiens
[04:00.92]out of Africa before the most important migration
[04:04.84]60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
[04:09.20]But the study said these appear to have been dead ends,
[04:12.84]meaning they produced nothing.
[04:16.04]Homo sapiens was not the first human species
[04:18.60]to live outside of Africa -
[04:20.80]including the area surrounding the hub.
[04:24.40]Ancient intermixing by modern humans
[04:27.36]has left small traces of Neanderthal
[04:30.48]in the DNA of modern non-Africans.
[04:34.84]The lead writer of the study, Leonardo Vallini,
[04:38.72]said there is evidence Neanderthals lived in the area
[04:42.68]"before the arrival of Homo sapiens,
[04:45.48]so the hub may well have been
[04:47.48]where that interaction took place."
[04:50.68]Homo sapiens is the scientific name
[04:53.36]for today's humans. It means "wise man."
