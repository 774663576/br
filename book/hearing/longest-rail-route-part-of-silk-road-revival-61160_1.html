[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.48]The longest railway in the world is now open. 
[00:09.91]In December, a train carrying products 
[00:18.59]from China arrived in Spain's capital, Madrid. 
[00:22.52]The railway is one of the most recent transportation projects 
[00:27.15]that China has financed in Europe. 
[00:30.23]China is paying to improve roads, bridges and railroads 
[00:36.06]to increase trade between East Asia and Europe. 
[00:40.04]The European Union is China's biggest trading partner, 
[00:44.86]and Europe is welcoming the money 
[00:47.66]China is spending to improve infrastructure.
[00:51.12]The train carried 40 containers and travelled 13,000 kilometers. 
[00:58.08]It began in Yiwu, 
[01:00.68]a Chinese city in the coastal province of Zhejiang, in November. 
[01:06.26]It arrived in Madrid three weeks later. 
[01:09.61]A ship would take about six weeks to make the same trip.
[01:14.45]The train is to return to China with Spanish wine 
[01:19.09]and food before the beginning of the Chinese New Year in February.
[01:24.23]Jonathan Fenby wrote the book "Will China Dominate the 21st Century?" 
[01:30.37]He says China has just begun its efforts to improve trade routes.
[01:36.43]"These things are, 
[01:38.34]are developing and they are going to go on developing, I think. 
[01:40.73]There is a rail link now from Chongqing in southwest China through Russia, 
[01:45.76]which ends in Duisberg in Germany," Fenby said.
[01:48.84]Trains now travel between Germany and China five times a week.
[01:54.59]China is investing a lot of money 
[02:01.61]to improve bridges and roads in Europe. 
[02:05.20]It recently paid $167 million 
[02:09.78]to build a bridge over the Danube river in Serbia. 
[02:13.98]Chinese Premier Li Keqiang went to the opening ceremony. 
[02:19.05]Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic 
[02:22.99]said the bridge is the first of many investments 
[02:26.69]China will make in his country.
[02:28.77]He says the bridge is a sign of friendship between China and Serbia. 
[02:40.28]He adds that there will be more such projects with China, 
[02:44.61]including, in his words, new bridges and new paths to the future.
[02:51.09]Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi says the money 
[02:55.13]his country is spending shows China 
[02:57.97]is taking a new approach to relations with other countries.
[03:02.55]He says by the end of 2014 China had created 70 relationships 
[03:14.59]with countries and areas around the world. 
[03:17.68]He says China is building partnerships, rather than alliances.
[03:23.25]China has promised to spend $40 billion to improve infrastructure. 
[03:30.37]The investments make China's presence known around the world.
[03:35.45]Observers say European countries have lessened their criticisms 
[03:40.89]of China's poor record for human rights 
[03:44.07]and political reform as China has improved Europe's infrastructure.
[03:49.70]And that's the Economics Report From VOA Learning English.
