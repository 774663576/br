。
[00:00.04]America's top spokesperson on public health,
[00:04.36]the U.S. surgeon general,
[00:07.12]recently said loneliness is as dangerous
[00:11.84]as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
[00:17.00]Dr. Vivek Murthy said loneliness
[00:21.12]costs the health industry billions of dollars each year,
[00:26.52]and he declared it the latest public health epidemic.
[00:33.40]In a report, Murthy said about half of U.S. adults
[00:38.92]say they have experienced loneliness.
[00:43.52]"We now know that loneliness is a common feeling
[00:47.80]that many people experience.
[00:50.44]It's like hunger or thirst.
[00:53.68]It's a feeling the body sends us
[00:56.92]when something we need for survival is missing,"
[01:02.32]Murthy told The Associated Press (AP):
[01:05.88]"Millions of people in America are struggling in the shadows,
[01:11.28]and that's not right. That's why I issued this advisory
[01:16.88]to pull back the curtain
[01:19.08]on a struggle that too many people are experiencing."
[01:24.64]To pull back the curtain means to show how something is or acts
[01:30.36]that is normally not seen in public.
[01:34.56]The declaration is meant to raise understanding about loneliness.
[01:40.32]However, it is not linked to federal financial support or programs
[01:46.72]meant to fight the problem.
[01:49.92]Recent research suggests that American
[01:53.68]have become less active with organized religion,
[01:58.08]community organizations and even their own family members.
[02:04.92]Research also shows Americans have reported
[02:08.88]an increase in feelings of loneliness.
[02:13.04]In addition to that,
[02:14.80]the number of households with a single unmarried person
[02:19.20]has doubled in the last 60 years.
[02:23.60]But this problem became more severe
[02:27.24]with the COVID-19 pandemic.
[02:30.88]Schools and workplaces closed
[02:34.24]and millions of Americans were separated from family and friends.
[02:41.44]The surgeon general's report said
[02:44.68]individual Americans reduced their friend groups
[02:49.36]and spent less time with friends who remained.
[02:54.68]Americans spent about 20 minutes a day
[02:58.80]in person with friends in 2020,
[03:02.68]down from 60 minutes a day 20 years earlier.
[03:09.08]The loneliness epidemic is especially affecting young people
[03:14.48]aged 15 to 24.
[03:18.20]The age group reported a 70 percent drop
[03:22.32]in time spent with friends during the same period.
[03:27.44]The report said loneliness increases the risk
[03:31.56]of an early death by nearly 30 percent.
[03:36.04]And it said people with poor social relationships
[03:41.40]have a greater risk of stroke and heart disease.
[03:47.12]The research found lack of social activity
[03:51.28]also increases the risk of developing mental health problems
[03:56.80]like depression, anxiety, and dementia.
[04:01.88]Murthy did not provide any data that shows
[04:05.88]how many people die directly
[04:08.60]from loneliness or lack of social activity.
[04:13.68]The surgeon general is calling on businesses,
[04:17.68]schools, community organizations, parents, and others
[04:24.12]to make changes that will increase the country's level of connection.
[04:30.64]He advised people to join community groups
[04:34.32]and put down their phones when they are meeting friends.
[04:39.04]Murthy also advised employers to consider their policies
[04:44.16]for working away from their offices.
[04:48.20]And he called on health systems to provide training for doctors
[04:53.72]to recognize the health risks of loneliness.
[04:58.76]Murthy said technology has increased loneliness.
[05:02.56]One study in the report researched people
[05:07.20]who used social media for two hours or more a day.
[05:13.28]It found that the group was more than twice as likely
[05:18.52]to report feeling a lack in social connection
[05:22.80]than those who spent less than 30 minutes a day on social media.
[05:29.84]Murthy said social media is driving the increase in loneliness.
[05:36.76]His report suggests that technology companies
[05:40.68]formulate protections for children
[05:43.68]especially around their social media behavior.
[05:48.92]Murthy said there is no replacement for in-person interaction.
[05:55.20]He added that Americans are using technology more for communication.
[06:02.48]He wondered: "We lost out on a lot of that in-person interaction.
[06:08.84]How do we design technology
[06:12.08]that strengthens our relationships as opposed to weaken them?"
