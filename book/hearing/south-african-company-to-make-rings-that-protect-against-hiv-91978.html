。
[00:00.04]A South African company
[00:02.56]will make vaginal devices
[00:05.20]that protect against HIV.
[00:09.24]Medical experts say that should at some point
[00:13.92]make them less costly and more easily available.
[00:20.16]HIV is a virus that causes AIDS,
[00:24.20]a serious disease that affects the body's
[00:27.68]natural defense system, or immune system.
[00:33.00]The Population Council is an international nonprofit
[00:38.32]that does medical research.
[00:42.00]It announced recently
[00:43.96]that the South African healthcare company Kiara Health
[00:48.88]will start making the devices, or rings,
[00:53.20]from the medical product silicone
[00:56.28]in the next few years.
[00:59.44]It estimates that 1 million could be produced each year.
[01:05.68]The devices release a drug that helps prevent HIV infections.
[01:12.48]They are approved by nearly 12 countries
[01:15.68]and the World Health Organization (WHO).
[01:21.36]The nonprofit group owns the rights to the ring,
[01:25.20]which are now made by a Swedish company.
[01:29.32]About 500,000 rings are currently available
[01:33.72]to women in Africa at no cost, bought by donors.
[01:39.96]Ben Phillips is a spokesman at the U.N. AIDS agency.
[01:45.92]He said the ring gives women the freedom to use it
[01:50.36]without anyone else's knowledge or agreement.
[01:55.80]"For women whose partners won't use a condom
[01:59.64]or allow them to take oral (preventative HIV) medicines,
[02:06.32]this gives them another option," he said.
[02:10.92]A condom is a device worn by a male partner
[02:14.92]to prevent pregnancy and the spread of sexual diseases.
[02:20.96]HIV remains the leading cause of death
[02:24.40]among women of reproductive age in Africa.
[02:30.04]And 60 percent of new infections are in women,
[02:35.16]information from WHO shows.
[02:39.96]The ring releases the drug dapivirine
[02:43.44]in small amounts over a month.
[02:47.52]It currently costs $12 to $16,
[02:52.56]but experts expect the price to drop
[02:55.72]once it is widely produced in Africa.
[03:00.16]Developers are also working on a version
[03:03.92]that will last up to three months,
[03:06.48]which should also lower the yearly cost.
[03:10.92]WHO has suggested the ring
[03:14.08]be used as an additional tool
[03:16.92]for women at high risk of HIV.
[03:21.24]Officials in more than 12 African countries,
[03:25.12]including South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Uganda
[03:30.72]and Zimbabwe have also approved it.
[03:35.52]WHO pointed to two studies in its approval,
[03:40.48]saying the ring reduced women's chances
[03:43.84]of getting HIV by about a third.
[03:48.76]While other research has suggested the risk
