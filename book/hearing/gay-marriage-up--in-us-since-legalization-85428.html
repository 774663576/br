<p>Same-sex marriages now make up a half a million American households, five years after the Supreme Court legalized such relationships.</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau reported last week that the number of married same-sex households has increased by almost 70 percent since 2014. The numbers are based on the Census Bureau's American Community <strong>Survey</strong>.</p>
<p>The survey found that about 980,000 households in the country belong to same-sex couples. It showed 58 percent, or a little more than 586,000, as married. The other 42 percent lived together outside of marriage.</p>

<p>There were more female couple households than male couple households, but not by a lot. Gary Gates, is a <strong>demographer</strong> specializing in <strong>LGBT</strong> issues. He said, "Opponents of marriage equality <strong>frequently</strong> argued that same-sex couples really weren't all that interested in marriage. But the large increase in marriages among same-sex couples since marriage equality became legal nationwide offers evidence of the clear desire for marriage among same-sex couples."</p>
<p>The survey showed noticeable economic differences between male couples and female couples, as well as same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples.</p>
<p>The study found that same-sex married couples generally earned more money, with average earnings of about $107,000 a year. That compares to almost $97,000 for opposite-sex couples. Among same-sex marriages, male couples earned more than female couples -- $123,646 compared to $87,690.</p>
<p>The research also found that same-sex married households were more likely to be in the workforce than opposite-sex married households -- 84.6 percent compared to 80.4 percent.</p>
<p>The study showed married women in same-sex households were much more likely to be working than married women in opposite-sex households. But married men in same-sex households were less likely to be working than married men in opposite-sex ones.</p>
<p>Gates said, "While most research that gay and bisexual men, on average, do not earn more than their comparable <strong>heterosexual </strong>male counterparts, that research also shows that they <strong>tend</strong> to earn more than lesbian and bisexual women."</p>
<p>Separate survey results also released Thursday show that almost 15 percent of same-sex couples had at least one child under the age of 18. The same is true of a little more than 48 percent of opposite-sex couples.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 300,000 children living in homes with same-sex couples, 66 percent were children of both partners, compared to 95 percent for opposite-sex couples, reports the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia had the greatest <strong>concentration</strong> of same-sex households. In the nation's capital, about 2.4 percent of households are same-sex households. The nearby state of Delaware followed, with 1.3 percent. The states of Oregon, Massachusetts and Washington came next, all a little over one percent, the survey found.</p>
<p>In the survey, more than 16 percent of same-sex married households were interracial couples, double the rate for opposite-sex married couples.</p>
<p>The U.S. had 122 million households in 2019. The number of gay and lesbian couples in the country is greater than 980,000 since that number only represented same-sex households. </p>
<p>The 2019 American Community Survey for the first time included updated relationship identifications that better captured the number and qualities of same-sex households in the United States. </p>

。
[00:00.04]Same-sex marriages now make up a half a million American households,
[00:06.24]five years after the Supreme Court legalized such relationships.
[00:13.36]The U.S. Census Bureau reported last week
[00:17.24]that the number of married same-sex households
[00:21.16]has increased by almost 70 percent since 2014.
[00:28.08]The numbers are based on the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.
[00:35.16]The survey found that about 980,000 households in the country
[00:41.84]belong to same-sex couples.
[00:45.28]It showed 58 percent, or a little more than 586,000, as married.
[00:54.72]The other 42 percent lived together outside of marriage.
[01:01.00]There were more female couple households
[01:03.96]than male couple households, but not by a lot.
[01:09.44]Gary Gates, is a demographer specializing in LGBT issues.
[01:16.88]He said, "Opponents of marriage equality frequently argued
[01:22.44]that same-sex couples really weren't all that interested in marriage.
[01:28.40]But the large increase in marriages among same-sex couples
[01:33.84]since marriage equality became legal nationwide
[01:38.20]offers evidence of the clear desire for marriage among same-sex couples."
[01:45.36]The survey showed noticeable economic differences
[01:49.60]between male couples and female couples,
[01:53.64]as well as same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples.
[02:00.04]The study found that same-sex married couples generally earned more money,
[02:06.24]with average earnings of about $107,000 a year.
[02:12.60]That compares to almost $97,000 for opposite-sex couples.
[02:20.56]Among same-sex marriages, male couples earned more than female couples
[02:26.96]-- $123,646 compared to $87,690.
[02:38.32]The research also found that same-sex married households
[02:43.04]were more likely to be in the workforce than opposite-sex married households
[02:49.56]-- 84.6 percent compared to 80.4 percent.
[02:56.72]The study showed married women in same-sex households
[03:01.40]were much more likely to be working
[03:04.44]than married women in opposite-sex households.
[03:08.84]But married men in same-sex households were less likely to be working
[03:14.96]than married men in opposite-sex ones.
[03:19.20]Gates said, "While most research that gay and bisexual men, on average,
[03:26.08]do not earn more than their comparable heterosexual male counterparts,
[03:31.92]that research also shows that they tend to earn more
[03:36.44]than lesbian and bisexual women."
[03:40.28]Separate survey results also released Thursday
[03:44.44]show that almost 15 percent of same-sex couples
[03:49.44]had at least one child under the age of 18.
[03:54.80]The same is true of a little more than 48 percent of opposite-sex couples.
[04:02.60]Of the nearly 300,000 children living in homes with same-sex couples,
[04:09.96]66 percent were children of both partners,
[04:14.00]compared to 95 percent for opposite-sex couples,

[05:17.28]The number of gay and lesbian couples in the country
[05:21.52]is greater than 980,000 since that number only represented same-sex households.
[05:30.96]The 2019 American Community Survey for the first time
[05:37.08]included updated relationship identifications
[05:41.08]that better captured the number and qualities
[05:44.56]of same-sex households in the United States.
