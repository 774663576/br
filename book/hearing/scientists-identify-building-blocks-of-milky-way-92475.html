[00:00.04]Researchers have identified
[00:03.04]two ancient star groupings
[00:05.72]that appear to be among
[00:08.08]the Milky Way Galaxy's earliest parts.
[00:13.24]The structures are named after
[00:15.68]the Hindu gods Shakti and Shiva.
[00:20.28]They were discovered using observations
[00:23.88]from the European Space Agency's
[00:27.12]Gaia space telescope.
[00:30.56]Scientists wrote in a study
[00:33.48]that the structures might be the remains
[00:36.72]of two galaxies that combined 12 billion years ago
[00:42.48]with the early pieces of the Milky Way.
[00:46.76]They said the discovery offers new information
[00:51.68]about how our galaxy formed.
[00:55.72]Researchers said Shakti and Shiva
[00:59.52]are made up of stars that contain similar chemicals.
[01:05.40]They are believed to have formed
[01:07.80]12 to 13 billion years ago.
[01:11.76]Each of the structures has a mass
[01:15.28]10 million times greater than our sun.
[01:19.88]Astronomer Khyati Malhan
[01:23.00]of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
[01:26.92]in Germany was the lead writer of the study.
[01:32.76]It was recently published in The Astrophysical Journal.
[01:39.28]Malhan said the study deals with a central question:
[01:44.48]"how do galaxies form in our universe?"
[01:49.12]The Milky Way is a large spiral-shaped galaxy
[01:53.52]made up of hundreds of billions of stars.
[01:58.48]It is a large, flat circle
[02:01.00]about 100,000 light years across.
[02:05.92]A light year is the distance light travels in a year.
[02:11.28]Malhan said the study might have identified
[02:15.40]the last event before the Milky Way
[02:18.64]began to take the shape it has today.
[02:22.68]The European Space Agency launched Gaia in 2013.
[02:29.08]The space telescope is helping to create
[02:32.76]the largest and most complete
[02:35.88]three-dimensional map of the Milky Way.
[02:39.68]The telescope is measuring the positions,
[02:43.28]distances, and movements of the stars.
[02:47.96]This data permitted researchers
[02:50.64]to find Shakti and Shiva.
[02:54.20]The researchers said Shiva and Shakti
[02:57.64]are now within 30,000 light years of the galaxy's center.
[03:04.28]The study builds on another recent discovery.
[03:08.76]In 2022, scientists using Gaia data
[03:14.12]identified what they called
[03:16.40]the "poor old heart" of the Milky Way.
[03:20.92]It is made up of a population of stars
[03:24.88]from the earliest period of the galaxy
[03:29.08]found near its center.
[03:32.36]The stars that make up Shiva and Shakti
[03:36.08]are different chemically
[03:38.24]from most of the Milky Way's other stars.
[03:42.76]They are called "metal poor"
[03:45.20]because of the amount of heavy elements they contain.
[03:50.52]For example, the stars have less iron,
[03:54.40]carbon, and oxygen
[03:56.72]than similar stars in other parts of the galaxy
[04:01.96]Heavier elements first formed inside the universe's
[04:06.44]earliest population of stars.
[04:10.00]When these stars exploded at the end of their life cycles,
[04:14.60]the elements were then sent out into space.
[04:19.16]Malhan said researchers would like to "trace
[04:23.08]the formation and evolution of the Milky Way
[04:27.64]starting from the beginning of it until present day."
[04:32.44]But he said this is difficult
[04:35.64]because the earliest period of the galaxy
[04:39.12]took place 11 to 12 billion years ago.
[04:43.80]Scientists say the Big Bang event
[04:46.40]started the formation of the universe
[04:49.08]about 13.8 billion years ago.
