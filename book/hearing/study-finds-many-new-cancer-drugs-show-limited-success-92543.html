。
[00:00.04]A new study has found that
[00:02.44]41 percent of cancer drugs receiving
[00:06.64]accelerated government approval
[00:09.52]do not improve survival or quality of life.
[00:13.84]The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's)
[00:18.84]accelerated approval program aims to get new drugs
[00:23.76]to patients as quickly as possible.
[00:26.88]But the effectiveness of the drugs differs.
[00:31.28]The program was created in 1992
[00:35.84]to speed up the approval of HIV drugs.
[00:40.12]Today, about 85 percent of accelerated approvals
[00:44.96]go to cancer drugs.
[00:48.00]The program helps the FDA
[00:50.56]collect data on early results of approved drugs.
[00:55.48]In exchange, drug companies
[00:58.40]are expected to use the data to do additional testing.
[01:03.60]They are to produce better evidence
[01:06.76]before drugs receive normal approval.
[01:09.96]The new study suggests most cancer drugs
[01:14.28]given accelerated approval
[01:16.72]do not improve or extend patients' lives within five years.
[01:23.08]Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is a cancer specialist
[01:27.72]and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.
[01:32.56]He was not involved in the research.
[01:36.36]Emanuel told The Associated Press (AP)
[01:40.36]he thinks five years should be enough time
[01:44.20]to examine the effectiveness of new drugs.
[01:48.16]"Thousands of people are getting those drugs.
[01:51.80]That seems a mistake if we don't know
[01:55.04]whether they work or not," he added.
[01:58.32]It is up to the FDA or the drug company
[02:02.48]to withdraw drugs that do not perform well.
[02:06.28]Sometimes the FDA decides
[02:09.88]that less clear evidence
[02:11.88]is good enough to give full approval.
[02:15.08]The new study found that between 2013 and 2017,
[02:21.28]46 cancer drugs were given accelerated approval.
[02:26.28]Of those, 63 percent were moved to normal approval.
[02:32.36]Forty-three percent demonstrated
[02:35.12]a good medical result in tests.
[02:38.44]The study was published
[02:40.72]in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[02:44.64]It was also discussed at the recent meeting
[02:48.24]of the American Association
[02:50.36]for Cancer Research in San Diego, California.
[02:54.80]Dr. Edward Cliff of Harvard Medical School
[02:58.84]was a co-writer of the study.
[03:01.44]He told the AP it is unclear
[03:04.88]how much cancer patients understand about drugs
[03:08.72]with accelerated approval.
[03:11.04]"We raise the question:
[03:13.36]Is that uncertainty being conveyed to patients?" he said.
[03:18.68]Drugs that received accelerated approval
[03:22.32]may be the only chance for patients with rare
[03:25.96]or advanced cancers, said Dr. Jennifer Litton.
[03:30.44]She is with the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.
[03:36.84]Litton, who was not involved with the study,
[03:40.44]said it is important for doctors
[03:43.36]to carefully explain the evidence.
[03:46.24]"It might be shrinking of tumor.
[03:49.04]It might be how long the tumor stays stable," Litton said.
[03:53.92]"You can provide the data you have,
[03:57.12]but you shouldn't overpromise."
[03:59.60]Congress recently changed the program
[04:03.32]to give the FDA more power
[04:06.00]and to simplify the process
[04:08.52]of withdrawing drugs when companies
[04:11.44]do not meet their commitments.
[04:13.84]The changes permit the FDA
[04:17.20]"to withdraw approval for a drug
[04:20.16]approved under accelerated approval,

[04:35.36]be started when the agency gives the first approval.
[04:39.84]This can speed up the process
[04:42.68]of confirming how effective a drug is, Duvall-Jones said.
