。
[00:01.84]Google recently said that it had solved
[00:04.96]a major problem in supercomputing
[00:07.84]with a new generation of processor called Willow.
[00:12.80]Along with other technology companies
[00:15.60]such as Microsoft
[00:17.04]and International Business Machines (IBM),
[00:21.00]Google, whose parent company is Alphabet,
[00:25.00]is working on quantum computing.
[00:28.68]The new development promises
[00:30.56]to increase computing speeds
[00:32.56]while limiting mistakes, or errors,
[00:35.12]which are a problem
[00:36.08]with quantum computing systems.
[00:39.40]Scientists at the company's
[00:40.84]Santa Barbara, California quantum laboratory
[00:44.32]announced they had at least partly solved
[00:47.32]the error problem on December 9.
[00:50.96]On the same day, the scientific publication Nature
[00:55.24]published their paper on error correction.
[00:59.32]Google said that the Willow processor
[01:01.96]carried out a computation in under five minutes
[01:05.36]that would have taken a fast supercomputer
[01:08.92]longer than the current age of the universe to complete.
[01:13.68]The work of the Google researchers, however,
[01:16.24]does not have any commercial uses yet.
[01:20.16]But Google hopes quantum computers
[01:22.80]will one day solve problems in medicine,
[01:25.64]battery chemistry
[01:27.60]and artificial intelligence (AI)
[01:30.76]that today's computers cannot solve.
[01:34.76]The Willow processor, or chip,
[01:36.92]runs on units of data called "quantum bits"
[01:39.96]or "qubits" for short.
[01:43.68]Qubits permit fast computing
[01:45.96]but can easily create errors.
[01:49.32]Google researchers have a theory that qubits
[01:52.40]might be affected by subatomic particles
[01:55.32]from events in space.
[01:58.16]As more qubits are placed onto a chip, however,
[02:01.56]the errors can increase to make the chip
[02:04.24]no better than today's usual computer chips.
[02:08.32]As a result, scientists have been working
[02:10.92]on quantum error-correction since the 1990s.
[02:15.80]Hartmut Neven,
[02:17.08]who leads Google's Quantum AI group,
[02:19.92]said that Willow has 105 qubits.
[02:24.92]In the paper recently published in Nature,
[02:27.72]Google researchers said
[02:29.56]they have found a way to connect
[02:31.88]the Willow chip's qubits
[02:33.76]so that error rates go down
[02:35.96]as the number of qubits goes up.
[02:39.68]Neven also said Willow
[02:41.68]can correct errors in "real time."
[02:44.36]That is an important step
[02:46.48]toward making quantum computers useful.
[02:50.32]"We are past the break even point,"
[02:52.56]Neven told Reuters.
[02:55.08]In a blog post,
[02:56.96]he said it was an unmistakable sign
[02:58.80]that "error correction is improving overall."
[03:02.80]In 2019, IBM challenged the claim
[03:06.24]that Google's quantum chip
[03:07.80]solved a problem that would take a normal computer
[03:10.92]10,000 years to complete.
[03:14.12]IBM said the problem could be solved
[03:16.60]in two-and-a-half days
[03:18.08]using different assumptions
[03:19.76]about computer system design.
[03:22.96]Google said in its blog post
[03:25.08]that it considered some of those concerns
[03:28.08]in its newest estimates.
[03:31.12]Even under the best conditions, Google said
[03:34.48]a computer of today would still take a billion years
[03:39.48]to get the same results as its latest chip.
[03:44.92]Some of Google's competitors
[03:46.80]are producing chips with more qubits than Willow.
[03:51.12]But Anthony Megrant,
[03:52.76]who is also with Google Quantum AI,
[03:56.00]told Reuters that Google is trying to make
[03:59.00]the most dependable qubits possible.
[04:02.64]Google produced its earlier chips
[04:04.80]in a shared building at the University of
[04:07.20]California, Santa Barbara.
[04:10.36]But for the Willow chips,
[04:12.24]Google built its own special laboratory.
[04:15.96]Megrant said that the new lab
[04:18.52]will speed up the process of making future chips.
[04:23.96]One major problem is that quantum chips
[04:26.68]must be kept at low temperatures
[04:29.40]in machines that can produce
[04:31.52]extremely low temperatures called cryostats.
[04:36.52]The new laboratory permits the researchers
[04:39.12]to work more quickly.
[04:41.60]"If we have a good idea,
[04:43.52]we want somebody on the team
[04:45.64]to be able to...get into that clean room
[04:48.80]and into one of these cryostats
[04:51.28]as fast as possible,
[04:53.12]so we can get lots of cycles of learning," Megrant said.
