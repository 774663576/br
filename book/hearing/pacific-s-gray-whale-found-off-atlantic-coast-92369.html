<p>They can be identified by the lack of a part of a body often seen on other whales: a dorsal fin. Also, they can be identified by their <strong>blotchy</strong> appearance which is different from the humpback and minke whales seen off New England.

[00:00.04]Scientists have confirmed the presence
[00:03.76]of a gray whale off New England
[00:07.48]in North America recently.
[00:11.68]The large sea animal disappeared
[00:14.92]from the Atlantic Ocean two centuries ago.
[00:20.76]The scientists are thrilled with the discovery
[00:24.84]but they say it shows
[00:26.76]the effects of climate change on sea life.
[00:31.76]Researchers with the New England Aquarium in Boston
[00:36.92]found the gray whale on March 1.
[00:41.88]At the time, they were flying about
[00:45.24]48 kilometers south of Nantucket,
[00:49.20]an island off the coast of Massachusetts
[00:53.92]in the Atlantic.
[00:56.84]The whale, which can weigh over 27,000 kilograms,
[01:02.88]usually lives in the northern Pacific Ocean.
[01:08.08]The gray whale disappeared
[01:10.16]from the Atlantic Ocean by the 18th century.
[01:16.32]But there have been five observations of the animal
[01:21.04]in the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters
[01:25.72]in the last 15 years, the aquarium said in a statement.
[01:33.04]The whale found this month
[01:35.40]was likely the same animal
[01:38.00]observed off the coast of Florida
[01:41.20]late last year, the aquarium said.
[01:45.84]The researchers who found the animal off Massachusetts
[01:50.76]said they were not sure at first.
[01:55.00]But after circling the area for 45 minutes,
[01:59.48]they were able to take photographs
[02:02.48]that confirmed it was a gray whale.
[02:06.72]"I didn't want to say out loud what it was,
[02:10.44]because it seemed crazy," said Orla O'Brien.
[02:16.80]She is a research scientist
[02:19.44]with the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life
[02:24.04]at the New England Aquarium.
[02:27.88]Scientists said they were thrilled to see the animal,
[02:32.44]but its presence probably has to do
[02:35.68]with the warming of the planet.
[02:39.52]The Northwest Passage,
[02:41.72]which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
[02:46.24]through the Arctic Ocean in Canada,
[02:49.56]has lacked ice in the summertime
[02:52.52]in recent years, they said.
[02:56.88]That means gray whales
[02:58.64]can travel through the passage in the summer
[03:01.88]when normally they would have been blocked,
[03:05.24]the scientists said.
[03:08.60]O'Brien said the animal's arrival off New England
[03:13.28]serves "as a reminder of how quickly marine species
[03:18.60]respond to climate change, given the chance."
[03:23.72]Gray whales were almost completely killed off
[03:27.24]by hunting during the years of commercial whaling.
[03:32.96]Today, the whales have recovered to the point
[03:36.68]that they are considered a species of "least concern"
[03:41.48]by the International Union
[03:44.48]for Conservation of Nature.
[03:48.64]The organization, however,
[03:51.08]considers the western population of whales
[03:54.96]that live off the coast of Asia to be endangered.
[04:01.00]They can be identified by the lack of a part of a body
[04:06.36]often seen on other whales: a dorsal fin.
[04:11.44]Also, they can be identified
[04:14.32]by their blotchy appearance
[04:17.12]which is different from the humpback
[04:19.96]and minke whales seen off New England.
[04:24.68]Gray whales can also be identified
[04:27.92]by the unusual sounds they make.
