。
[00:00.16]Americans are still frustrated with the economy
[00:04.16]although new economic information suggests
[00:07.76]people are working and pay is higher.
[00:12.32]Many people say the economic recovery has left them behind.
[00:17.64]They say they plan to voice their frustrations
[00:22.04]when they vote in the presidential election in November.
[00:26.32]Denise Alber from Stafford County in the state of Virginia is one of those people.
[00:33.92]She has two college degrees.
[00:37.64]She has decided not to work and to help her 98-year-old mother.
[00:44.92]Together, they receive a fixed income of nearly $25,000 a year.
[00:53.12]That total is just above the poverty rate for a family of two.
[00:59.60]She says the price for food, gasoline and electricity have increased,
[01:06.20]but her family's income has not gone up.
[01:09.92]"It's been very, very difficult to maintain that same standard of living, we have not maintained it."
[01:16.96]Alber believes that the middle class is not being treated fairly.
[01:23.08]New government data show that family incomes rose over five percent in 2015.
[01:31.56]That is the largest increase since 2007.
[01:36.56]That increase is another indication that the U.S. recovery continues.
[01:43.52]However, economists say incomes remain nearly two percent below levels in 2007,
[01:52.32]before the start of the Great Recession.
[01:56.40]Maya MacGuineas is the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
[02:02.48]She understands why many Americans feel like the recovery has left them behind.
[02:11.16]She said Americans once took a job and the salary grew until retirement.
[02:18.76]"I don't think it feels like that anymore."
[02:21.28]Economists say it is that sense of betrayal
[02:25.64]that is driving much of the anger during this election season.
[02:30.52]Some dissatisfaction is caused by a feeling that middle class incomes
[02:36.76]have remained the same while wealthy families have prospered.
[02:42.76]Elise Gould is senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
[02:50.76]She says the difference between the highest and lowest earners
[02:55.96]has increased since the recession.
[02:59.68]"The top five percent is still the only group that has completely returned back to their 2000 levels.
[03:05.20]So they've made up lost ground. There's inequality across the income distribution."
[03:08.88]Some economists blame the lack of an economic recovery for all
[03:13.88]on political disagreements in Washington.
[03:17.84]That is one of the reasons Denise Alper says the next election is so important.
[03:25.56]But, she is not hopeful that the leading candidates will be able to provide results.
[03:32.68]"In terms of the economy or politics, I'm very despondent in that regard.
[03:37.88]I don't think either candidate will help the middle class."
[03:42.44]I'm Jonathan Evans.
