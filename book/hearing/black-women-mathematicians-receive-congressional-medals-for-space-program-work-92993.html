[00:01.12]The United States Congress
[00:03.48]has honored four women
[00:05.84]known as the "hidden figures" of the space race
[00:10.52]with its highest civilian award.
[00:15.08]The Congressional Gold Medal
[00:17.40]was presented Wednesday
[00:19.76]to the families of Katherine Johnson,
[00:23.04]Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson
[00:26.12]and Christine Darden at the U.S. Capitol.
[00:31.20]Only Darden is still living.
[00:33.76]The 82-year-old watched the ceremony
[00:38.04]from her Connecticut home.
[00:42.00]Lawmakers recognized the four Black mathematicians
[00:46.80]for their critical work early in the space program.
[00:52.44]They also presented a medal
[00:54.80]to all the women who worked as mathematicians,
[00:58.56]engineers and "human computers"
[01:02.64]in the American space program
[01:05.28]from the 1930s to 1970s.
[01:10.44]Margot Lee Shetterly
[01:12.52]wrote the 2016 book Hidden Figures
[01:16.80]about the Black women mathematicians
[01:19.92]who supported the space program in the 1960s.
[01:25.56]It was made into a movie of the same name in 2017.
[01:31.84]"By honoring them, we honor the very best
[01:35.32]of our country's spirit,"
[01:37.84]Shetterly said at the ceremony.
[01:42.16]The early space program employed
[01:44.96]hundreds of women to work as mathematicians
[01:48.96]at what is now NASA's
[01:51.80]Langley Research Center in Virginia.
[01:55.88]But, the Black mathematicians
[01:58.00]were not permitted to work
[01:59.96]with the white mathematicians
[02:02.44]because of racial separation policies at the time.
[02:07.52]The Black researchers' work
[02:09.60]went unrecognized for years.
[02:13.40]The team used pencils, slide rulers
[02:17.16]and mechanical calculating machines
[02:20.32]to calculate the paths of rockets and orbiters
[02:24.88]in the atmosphere and in space.
[02:28.60]The path is called the trajectory.
[02:31.52]"Our office computed all the trajectories,"
[02:36.12]Katherine Johnson told
[02:38.04]The Virginian-Pilot newspaper in 2012.
[02:42.32]"You tell me when and where you want it to come down,
[02:46.56]and I will tell you where and when
[02:50.52]and how to launch it," she explained.
[02:55.44]In 1961, Johnson did trajectory research
[03:00.20]for the Freedom 7 Mission,
[03:02.36]the first to carry an American into space.
[03:07.36]The next year, she checked the calculations
[03:10.96]made by a new NASA computer
[03:14.20]for astronaut John Glenn's
[03:16.80]planned orbits around the planet.
[03:20.40]John Glenn did not trust the new computer.
[03:24.08]Days before the launch, he told NASA,
[03:28.12]"Get the girl to check the numbers."
[03:31.96]John Glenn become the first American
[03:34.84]to orbit the Earth in 1962.
[03:39.68]Johnson was awarded
[03:41.96]the Presidential Medal of Freedom
[03:44.64]– the nation's highest civilian honor  – in 2015.
[03:50.96]Her work at NASA helped open doors
[03:54.40]for many other women
[03:56.16]to take part in the space program.
[04:00.16]Dorothy Vaughan rose to become
[04:02.76]NASA's first Black female supervisor.
[04:07.36]Mary Jackson was NASA's
[04:09.88]first Black female engineer.
[04:12.84]And Christine Darden is best known
[04:16.60]for her sonic boom research.
