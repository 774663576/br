[00:00.04]Scientists say newly examined data
[00:04.48]from a Chinese explorer on Mars
[00:08.16]adds to existing evidence that the planet
[00:12.28]once had a very large ocean.
[00:16.56]The exploring vehicle,
[00:19.16]or rover, is called Zhurong.
[00:22.52]It landed on the Martian surface in 2021.
[00:28.08]The rover has been operating
[00:30.56]in an area known as Utopia Planitia.
[00:34.92]This area is a large plain
[00:38.52]in Mars' northern hemisphere,
[00:41.44]the American space agency NASA explains.
[00:46.12]The researchers combined data
[00:49.64]from Zhurong's instruments
[00:52.00]with observations from satellites
[00:55.32]and spacecraft orbiting Mars.
[00:59.08]The team said the examinations
[01:02.28]appeared to show that Utopia Planitia
[01:06.60]had geological elements
[01:08.96]suggesting an ancient ocean coastline.
[01:12.80]The scientists said multiple elements, or features,
[01:18.56]pointed to evidence that a large ocean
[01:21.96]existed on Mars billions of years ago.
[01:26.48]The discovered surface features included
[01:30.72]troughs and channels that may have been
[01:34.68]formed by flowing water on Mars.
[01:38.56]Earlier research that examined
[01:41.48]data of similar surface features
[01:44.40]suggested they might have been created
[01:47.56]by mud volcanoes,
[01:50.20]which likely formed in areas
[01:53.32]where there had been water or ice.
[01:56.88]The researchers said the evidence
[02:00.40]suggests the area likely contained
[02:04.16]deep ocean environments
[02:06.32]as well as shallow ones.
[02:09.28]The research findings were recently reported
[02:13.12]in a study in the publication Scientific Reports.
[02:18.28]Bo Wu was the lead writer of the study.
[02:23.32]He is a planetary scientist
[02:26.64]at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
[02:30.40]Wu told Reuters news agency,
[02:33.68]"We estimate the flooding
[02:36.24]of the Utopia Planitia on Mars
[02:39.64]was approximately 3.68 billion years ago.
[02:45.12]The ocean surface was likely frozen
[02:49.08]in a geologically short period."
[02:52.12]The search for water on Mars is closely linked
[02:57.20]to the search for signs of possible life.
[03:00.88]Evidence of a past ocean raises the possibility
[03:05.88]that the planet may have once supported
[03:09.04]microbial life.
[03:11.20]There have been past studies
[03:14.48]suggesting Mars once had a large northern ocean.
[03:18.88]One such study was released in 2022.
[03:24.12]That research was based on
[03:27.04]satellite images of the Martian surface.
[03:30.44]The images were combined to produce detailed maps
[03:35.64]of the planet's northern hemisphere.
[03:39.04]Examination of the maps
[03:41.44]led to evidence of coastlines
[03:44.44]that once sat at the edge of a large ocean.
[03:48.48]Another study, released in August,
[03:52.44]presented evidence suggesting Mars
[03:55.68]may contain a large ocean
[03:58.68]deep beneath its surface.
[04:01.76]That evidence was based on NASA's InSight Lander.
[04:07.24]China's Zhurong rover
[04:10.44]began its data collection mission in May 2021.
[04:15.40]It stopped operating about one year later,
[04:19.32]with mission planners saying the power system
[04:23.00]was likely affected by sand and dust.
[04:26.96]But the rover still outlasted
[04:29.88]its planned mission of three months.
[04:33.68]The researchers said the data shows
[04:37.60]that the ocean seems to have disappeared
[04:41.04]by about 3.42 billion years ago.
[04:45.52]The study suggests the water
[04:48.68]that likely filled the Martian ocean
[04:51.80]was "heavily silted,"
[04:53.80]study co-writer Sergey Krasilnikov said.
[04:58.64]He is a planetary scientist
[05:01.76]at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
[05:05.12]Silt is a mix of sand and clay
[05:08.84]that has been carried by water,
[05:11.32]but later settles on land.
[05:14.24]Krasilnikov added that
[05:16.88]during the period when the Martian ocean
[05:20.12]would have been active,
[05:21.92]the planet "...probably had a thick,
[05:24.64]warm atmosphere."
[05:27.08]At that time, "microbial life
[05:30.04]was much more likely," he said.
[05:33.36]Hong Kong Polytechnic's Wu
[05:36.68]said the new findings do "provide further evidence
[05:41.16]to support the theory of a Martian ocean."
[05:45.12]However, he told the French news agency AFP
[05:50.04]the study does "not claim
[05:52.44]that our findings definitively prove"
[05:55.92]there was an ocean on Mars.
[05:58.44]Such proof, he said,
[06:01.36]would likely require a future mission
[06:04.68]to bring Mars materials back to Earth
[06:08.40]for closer study.
