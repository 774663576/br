<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about something found in water – <u>waves</u>.</p>
<p>Surfers are experts at riding waves in the ocean. But even if you have never been in the ocean or tried the sport of surfing, you can still <u>ride the waves</u>.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A surfer rides a wave as the color of the sky is reflected on the water in Navarre Beach, Fla., Monday, June 17, 2024.

<p>If you <u>ride the wave</u> of something you gain from a widespread popularity or approval of something. The online dictionary <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ride%20a%2Fthe%20wave%20of">Merriam-Webster</a> defines it this way: "to experience a time when many people share a strong feeling or <strong>attitude</strong> about something at the same time."</p>
<p>For example, let's say a woman runs for office but she doesn't have any political experience. She does, however, belong to a famous and popular political family. After she wins, many people say she <u>rode the wave</u> of her family's fame.</p>
<p>But this expression doesn't always mean taking <strong>advantage</strong> of something in a bad way. For example, a sports team may want to <u>ride the wave</u> of their recent wins to keep on winning.</p>
<p><u>Catching the wave</u> is a similar expression. If you <u>catch the wave,</u> you also take advantage of an <strong>opportunity</strong>. You are at the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes we aren't <u>riding or catching waves</u>, but <u>making waves</u> instead. When we <u>make waves</u> we do something that makes people notice us. Often they notice us in a bad way. And the <u>waves</u> we make cause problems -- similar to <u>waves</u> in water making trouble for boats and swimmers.</p>
<p>Here's an example. If you start a new job, it is usually not a good idea to <u>make waves</u>. When you <u>make waves</u> you create trouble and interfere with usual business operations. We can also say to <u>rock the boat.</u> This also means to cause problems.</p>
<p>We use the word "wave" in several phrasal verbs.</p>
<p>Let's start by combining it with "on" and "off."</p>
<p><u>Waving someone on</u> is the same thing as giving them a sign to keep moving. For example, when police officers direct traffic they <u>wave people on</u>. The police are guiding drivers or walkers across roads. <u>Waving someone on</u> can also mean to <strong>encourage</strong> someone. If your friend is running in a race, you can <u>wave them on</u> to the finish line.</p>
<p>However, if you <u>wave something or someone off</u>, you cancel, <strong>dismiss,</strong> or refuse them. For example, when I offered help to the man who had fallen off his bike he just <u>waved me off.</u> He either didn't need or want my help or maybe was too <strong>embarrassed</strong> to accept it.</p>
<p>You can also combine "wave" with "down." To <u>wave down</u> someone or something is also a signal to stop. For example, you can <u>wave down</u> a friend or wave down a taxicab.</p>
<p>And if you <u>wave something or someone aside</u> you are either directing them or dismissing them. It depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear some of these "wave" terms used in a short example.</p>
<p><em>Once I invited a friend to a <strong>concert</strong>. The musical group was very popular. They were riding the <u>wave</u> of a similar but earlier rock and roll band. Many people would come to their concerts just to gather in the parking lot and listen to the music from a distance. And that is what happened during this concert.</em></p>
<p><em>But this <strong>venue</strong> was different than most. It was outside and did not have a barrier around it. So, people without<strong> tickets </strong>started <strong>sneaking</strong> in. Someone would find a place where they could sneak in and wave on others to do the same. As a result the venue got so crowded that the security guards had to <u>wave</u> ticket-holders aside to a different entrance. And if you didn't have a ticket and hadn't snuck in, they just <u>waved you off.</u></em></p>
<p><em>As my friend and I waited in line to enter, I warned her that the concert would be very crowded. But she <u>waved my concerns</u> aside. She didn't care. We went in anyway. But after the concert was over, I immediately <u>waved down</u> a taxi to go home. I had had enough of the large crowd.</em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories. Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>
