[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English, this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.16]Investors in the United States 
[00:08.20]are preparing for the first public sale of stock 
[00:12.14]in the Chinese company Alibaba. 
[00:15.16]The company sells goods by linking buyers and sellers 
[00:20.25]in the huge Chinese online market. 
[00:23.53]Alibaba is expected to make its initial public offering, 
[00:29.51]called an IPO, in September on the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:35.58]The total value of the company based in Hangzhou 
[00:41.05]has been estimated at about $200 billion. 
[00:44.98]Reports from Bloomberg News say 
[00:49.54]Alibaba is offering investors 
[00:53.00]a 12 percent share of the company. 
[00:55.48]That would mean the company could raise 
[00:58.97]as much as $20 billion in the public stock sale.
[01:04.22]After the IPO, 
[01:06.86]Alibaba could become one of the most 
[01:10.47]valuable technology companies in the world. 
[01:13.47]Apple for example, 
[01:16.32]has a market value of about $600 billion, 
[01:20.98]Google is valued at about $390 billion, 
[01:26.09]and Microsoft is worth about $370 billion.
[01:31.66]The e-commerce company is responsible 
[01:36.02]for most online sales in China. 
[01:39.10]It dealt with more exchanges last year 
[01:42.64]than U.S. companies Amazon and eBay combined. 
[01:47.20]And it has more than 230 million active buyers.
[01:52.98]Scott Kennedy is director of Indiana University's Research Center 
[01:59.56]for Chinese Politics &amp; Business.
[02:02.03]"Alibaba has grown from a very small company 
[02:06.63]doing e-commerce 15 years ago 
[02:10.17]or so to now being the dominant e-business company in China," Kennedy said.
[02:15.64]Mr. Kennedy says Alibaba has expanded into new areas 
[02:21.26]while growing its share of the e-commerce market.
[02:25.24]"It also is involved in banking and other areas 
[02:29.73]and has just been growing so dramatically 
[02:32.78]that it now accounts for 80 percent 
[02:37.01]of e-commerce in China," Kennedy said.
[02:39.03]He says the company is profitable 
[02:41.81]which is unusual for a technology company 
[02:45.27]first offering an IPO. 
[02:47.85]Alibaba has chosen to sell its stock 
[02:52.48]to the public on the New York Stock Exchange rather than in China. 
[02:57.75]Scott Kennedy says that selling stock 
[03:01.86]on Chinese exchanges has been difficult.
[03:05.13]"Chinese companies have been trying to raise capital 
[03:08.51]on stock markets for a long time.  
[03:10.18]Within China listing has been difficult 
[03:13.82]and that market has not done very well," Kennedy said.
[03:16.90]He says that the Chinese economy has grown quickly over the years, 
[03:21.47]but has not supported strong stock market activity. 
[03:25.71]The California based Internet company Yahoo 
[03:30.21]owns about one-forth of Alibaba. 
[03:33.30]The IPO in September could increase the value of Yahoo's share. 
[03:39.39]China is now the world's second largest market for e-commerce.
[03:45.49]And that's the Economics Report for VOA Learning English.
