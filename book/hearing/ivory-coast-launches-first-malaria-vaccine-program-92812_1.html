<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Ivory Coast Launches First Malaria Vaccine Program]

。
[00:00.04]Health workers in Ivory Coast
[00:03.32]have launched the country's first
[00:06.28]child vaccination program against malaria.
[00:11.20]The effort aims to reduce cases of
[00:15.24]the mosquito-spread disease,
[00:17.68]which has become one of Africa's biggest killers.
[00:22.36]Officials in the West African nation
[00:25.88]said the program is designed to cover
[00:29.40]about 250,000 children under the age of two.
[00:35.56]The three-shot vaccine was developed
[00:39.04]by Britain's Oxford University.
[00:42.28]The World Health Organization (WHO)
[00:46.76]approved the vaccine last October.
[00:50.40]Research has shown the vaccine
[00:53.72]to be more than 75 percent effective
[00:57.56]at preventing severe disease
[01:00.24]and death during the first year.
[01:03.72]A second shot, called a booster,
[01:07.08]aims to extend the protection
[01:10.00]for at least another year.
[01:12.52]India's Serum Institute has already made
[01:17.08]25 million doses of the Oxford vaccine.
[01:21.88]It says it plans to make
[01:24.20]at least 100 million each year.
[01:28.36]The cost is $4 per dose.
[01:31.88]More than 95 percent of the world's estimated
[01:36.40]249 million yearly malaria cases
[01:41.12]and 608,000 deaths happen in Africa.
[01:47.04]The disease most often affects children
[01:50.96]under the age of five,
[01:53.04]as well as pregnant women.
[01:55.40]Pierre Demba is Ivory Coast's health minister.
[02:00.68]He told reporters the malaria vaccine launch
[02:05.28]demonstrates the government's desire
[02:08.56]to invest in the country's children.
[02:12.08]"They are the future of our country," he said.
[02:16.60]Adrian Hill of Oxford University
[02:19.84]said in a statement that the effort
[02:23.20]"marks the start of a new era
[02:26.32]in malaria control."
[02:28.76]He added that he hopes the shot
[02:31.88]will soon be available to all countries in Africa
[02:36.08]who want to use it.
[02:38.16]Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso
[02:42.52]and the Central African Republic
[02:45.04]are among the nations that
[02:47.32]have already approved the vaccine.
[02:50.72]Other countries, including Cameroon,
[02:54.16]have begun widespread vaccination programs.
[02:58.48]Alice Kanga was one of many mothers
[03:02.28]who brought children to get vaccinated.
[03:05.64]She told reporters from The Associated Press,
[03:10.16]"It's really important for the children,
[03:13.32]for their health."
[03:14.56]In one poor neighborhood in the city of Abidjan,
[03:19.08]many women waited with their babies for shots,
[03:23.64]the French news agency AFP reported.
[03:28.24]One mother brought
[03:30.04]her eight-month-old daughter, Awa.
[03:32.80]Sitting on her mother's knees
[03:35.40]and held tightly between her arms,
[03:38.28]the child cried while preparing
[03:41.04]to receive her first dose.
[03:44.04]"I'm happy," Awa's mother said with a smile.
[03:48.60]"I have seen all the mothers who have come
[03:52.04]to be vaccinated against malaria."
[03:55.16]Officials from the WHO
[03:58.32]have warned that even with
[04:00.64]the new vaccination campaign,
[04:03.32]other measures should continue to be taken
[04:06.88]to stop disease spread.
[04:09.72]These include spraying with chemical insect killers
[04:14.76]and using bed nets for protection.
[04:18.32]I'm Bryan Lynn.
