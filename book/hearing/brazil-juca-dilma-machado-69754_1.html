。
[00:00.16]Brazil's planning minister resigned from office on Monday
[00:04.84]after a recording of him was made public.
[00:08.52]The recording appears to show Romero Jucá
[00:12.00]plotting the impeachment of now-suspended President Dilma Rousseff.
[00:17.36]He reportedly was talking with a former oil company official
[00:21.70]about how to stop a corruption investigation.
[00:25.84]Jucá denies the allegations.
[00:29.32]He claimed that the words he said were taken out of context.
[00:34.92]On Monday, the planning minister said he would temporarily resign from the acting government.
[00:42.04]He had been in office less than two weeks.
[00:45.88]The Brazilian newspaper Folha published a partial transcript of the recording on Monday.
[00:53.32]The Reuters news agency reports that the paper said the recording was made "secretly."
[01:00.80]In it, Jucá and the former oil company official, Sergio Machado,
[01:06.80]discuss a government investigation of the state-operated oil company Petrobras.
[01:13.32]Both men have been named in the investigation.
[01:17.92]In the transcript, Jucá said
[01:20.48]"We have to change the government so the bleeding is stopped."
[01:25.24]Machado reportedly said that, "The easiest solution is to put Michel in."
[01:31.60]That appears to refer to Vice President Michel Temer,
[01:35.88]Brazil's acting president during the suspension of Rousseff.
[01:40.44]Jucá is reported to have said he was working with the country's justices,
[01:46.08]who have the final word on impeachment.
[01:49.80]The recording was apparently made in March
[01:53.04]before the Senate voted to impeach Rousseff.
[01:56.56]Rousseff's supporters say the recording shows that
[02:00.36]she is the victim of an attempt to overthrow the government.
[02:05.16]The Brazilian Senate voted to place Rousseff on trial earlier this month.
[02:10.80]She is charged with using record-keeping tricks
[02:14.56]to hide Brazil's budget deficit when she campaigned for reelection in 2014.
[02:21.28]She currently is suspended for up to 180 days
[02:26.16]while her trial takes place.
[02:29.20]I'm Jonathan Evans.
[02:31.16]
