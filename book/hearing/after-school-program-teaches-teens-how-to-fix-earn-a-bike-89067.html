。
[00:00.04]At Phoenix Bikes, a non-profit bicycle shop and educational center,
[00:05.16]students are learning their ABCs.
[00:08.24]That stands for the air, brakes, and chain of basic bike mechanics.
[00:14.72]Phoenix Bikes sells bikes to the public at their business in Arlington, Virginia.
[00:20.08]But it also teaches teenagers how to repair bikes.
[00:24.28]Most students at Phoenix start in its after-school "earn-a-bike program,"
[00:30.12]at middle and high schools in and around Arlington County.
[00:34.88]Once a week over a 12 week period, students learn repair skills.
[00:40.48]They learn how to use tools, fix flat tires,
[00:44.20]align the wheels, and adjust brakes and gears.
[00:48.68]The first lesson involves taking the bike apart,
[00:52.16]or stripping it down to its basic structure, the frame.
[00:56.12]By doing this, they learn all the parts of a bike.
[01:01.20]In the first weeks, they work in small groups
[01:04.08]to repair a bike donated to the shop.
[01:06.92]The bikes often have missing or damaged parts.
[01:11.68]The finished bike is then given to a person in need from the community.
[01:16.20]Phoenix Bikes director Emily Gage said the shop partners
[01:21.04]with several local organizations to donate the bikes.
[01:25.52]Some bikes have been going to Afghan refugees resettled in the area.
[01:31.92]In the last four weeks of the program, students come
