。
[00:00.04]A sunken Greek village
[00:02.24]has begun to reappear
[00:04.72]after water levels dropped
[00:06.96]in the lake that covered it.
[00:09.48]Extreme hot, dry weather is blamed
[00:13.72]for the disappearing Lake Mornos.
[00:17.56]The village of Kallio was flooded
[00:20.92]in 1980 to create the lake.
[00:24.52]The plan aimed to help supply
[00:28.16]the ever-increasing water demands
[00:30.76]of the national capital
[00:32.72]about 200 kilometers away.
[00:36.24]Now, long stretches of dried soil
[00:40.04]mixed with old bricks
[00:41.84]surround the ruins of the Kallio.
[00:45.56]"Day by day, the water goes down,"
[00:49.48]said Dimitris Giannopoulos,
[00:52.40]mayor of central Greece's Dorida area.
[00:56.60]Reuters news agency reports
[00:59.80]Lake Mornos supplies water
[01:03.00]to nearly half of Greece's population.
[01:06.88]Last winter brought little snow to Greece.
[01:11.32]This summer brought heatwaves
[01:13.80]but little rain to the country.
[01:16.24]Last winter was Greece's warmest on record.
[01:20.80]Greece's dry climate makes it especially
[01:24.64]susceptible to the effects of a warming planet.
[01:28.92]The conditions worsened summer wildfires
[01:33.20]including some that reached
[01:35.20]outer areas of Athens last month.
[01:38.68]Scientists say extreme weather
[01:42.84]is now driving the dropping lake level.
[01:46.64]"It is an alarm bell," said Efthymis Lekkas,
[01:51.68]a professor of disaster management
[01:54.80]at the University of Athens.
[01:57.32]"We don't know what will happen in the coming period.
[02:01.60]If we have a rainless winter,
[02:04.36]things will get difficult."
[02:06.64]Giannopoulos noted that the Mount Giona
[02:11.08]mountain that rises up from the lake
[02:14.12]used to be snow-covered.
[02:16.48]But it saw none last winter.
[02:19.64]Around the lake,
[02:21.12]some trees have taken on a yellowish color.
[02:24.92]"They lack water. This has never happened before,"
[02:29.28]Giannopoulos said.
[02:31.44]Wells in the area are now drying up, he added.
[02:35.84]And surrounding villages
[02:38.32]– which do not take water from the lake
[02:41.44]– suffered water cuts this summer.
[02:44.16]A local firefighter chief
[02:46.60]said the risk of wildfires
[02:49.12]increases as the forests become drier.
[02:53.48]Satellite images suggest
[02:56.40]the lake's surface area
[02:58.44]shrank from around 16.8 square kilometers
[03:03.36]in August 2022 to just 12 this year.
[03:08.52]In addition, water supplies
[03:11.64]at three other water bodies
[03:14.08]dropped to 700 million cubic meters in August.
[03:19.48]This water supplies Attica,
[03:22.12]an area of around 4 million people
[03:25.24]that includes Athens.
[03:27.40]That was down from 1.2 billion
[03:31.60]cubic meters in 2022,
[03:34.72]the country's environment ministry said.
[03:38.60]The Greek government says
[03:41.00]the state-run Athens water company
[03:44.00]had begun supplying those areas
[03:46.76]with additional sources of water.
[03:49.68]Former residents of Kallio were surprised
[03:53.80]to see the village again.
[03:55.96]But some said they were saddened
[03:58.48]by its current state.
[04:00.48]"I used to see it full and say it was a beach.
[04:04.40]Now all you see is dryness,"
[04:07.64]said 90-year-old Konstantinos Gerodimos.
[04:12.48]His 77-year-old wife Maria added:
[04:16.60]"If it continues like this,
[04:19.48]the entire village will appear,
[04:22.16]all the way to the bottom,
[04:23.92]where the church and our home was."
