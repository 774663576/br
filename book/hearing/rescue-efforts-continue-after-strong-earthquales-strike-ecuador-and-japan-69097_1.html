。
[00:00.32]Efforts to rescue victims continue after strong earthquakes in Ecuador and Japan
[00:07.88]killed hundreds and injured thousands.
[00:11.68]In Ecuador, officials say at least 350 people died
[00:18.00]and more than 2,500 were injured in an earthquake
[00:23.76]that struck the coastal area late Saturday.
[00:28.08]Officials say the number of dead will increase
[00:32.20]as aid workers reach isolated areas.
[00:36.96]Rescuers are digging with their hands and tools
[00:41.44]to find survivors under collapsed buildings.
[00:45.72]Soldiers have been deployed to areas hit by the earthquakes.
[00:50.84]President Rafael Correa visited the coastal city of Manta,
[00:56.88]where the earthquake caused much damage.
[01:00.52]He said the earthquake was the worst natural disaster in his country
[01:06.84]since 1949, when thousands of people died in an earthquake.
[01:13.76]Officials say the quake was felt throughout the country.
[01:18.28]It stopped electricity and mobile phone service throughout the capital, Quito.
[01:26.00]In Japan, the U.S. military is helping Japan recover from three powerful earthquakes there.
[01:35.00]At least 41 people were killed in southern Japan on the large island of Kyushu.
[01:43.40]Officials said as many as 100 people
[01:47.24]were trapped under collapsed buildings in Kumamoto Prefecture.
[01:53.72]In addition to the dead and the missing,
[01:56.72]almost 2,000 people have been hurt since the first earthquake struck Thursday.
[02:03.84]Buildings collapsed. Fires and landslides occurred.
[02:09.40]Two stronger quakes struck on Friday and Saturday.
[02:14.68]On Sunday, the Japanese government sent
[02:17.88]25,000 Self Defense Force troops to help people on Kyushu.
[02:25.64]Officials say many people are trapped or buried under collapsed buildings or homes.
[02:33.08]About 200,000 people are in evacuation centers at schools and government buildings.
[02:41.08]Officials will not have complete damage reports until all communities are reached.
[02:48.40]Dangerous aftershocks often happen after large earthquakes.
[02:53.80]Experts say they will be felt in southern Japan for more than a week.
[02:59.68]There have been more than 450 aftershocks since Thursday.
[03:06.24]"There is no connection between the earthquakes" in Japan and Ecuador,
[03:11.96]says Gavin Hayes, PhD, a research geophysicist
[03:16.56]with the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado.
[03:22.04]"Earthquakes are random," he says,
[03:25.04]and sometimes they happen around the same time.
[03:29.00]These recent ones are not connected, he says.
[03:33.76]What Japan and Ecuador do have in common
[03:38.01]is that they are both part of what is called the "ring of fire."
[03:43.72]That is the area around the edges of the Pacific Ocean,
[03:48.68]like coastal Asia and coastal North and South America.
[03:54.76]According to the U.S. Geological Survey,
[03:58.40]90 percent of the world's earthquakes happen there.
[04:04.72]Earthquakes happen when the "plates"
[04:08.52]— or the crust and upper layer of the earth -- move against each other.
[04:15.04]When they shift, it causes the earth to shake and shudder,
[04:20.36]moving energy along the lines of the plates.
[04:25.04]These lines are called faults.
[04:28.60]Hayes says earthquakes are not increasing or getting worse than in the past.
[04:36.40]What is different is word spreads more quickly now.
[04:42.28]"We are in a situation now that everyone is in tune with the Internet and media...
[04:49.52]and we're hearing more about (earthquakes) than in the past."
[04:55.08]With Twitter and other social media, Hayes says,
[04:59.40]people can post pictures and information immediately after an earthquake.
