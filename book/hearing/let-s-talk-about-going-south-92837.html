<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today, we talk about those times when things do not go as planned. All the planning in the world does not guarantee that your plans will happen the way you had planned.</p>
<p>Things can happen that are outside of your control. To talk about those times when things go <strong>awry</strong>, American English has two directional expressions: <u>go south</u> and <u>go sideways</u>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Passengers crowd the international flights departure area of Rome's Fiumicino airport, July 19, 2024.

<p><strong>To go south</strong></p>
<p>Let's start with <u>go south</u>. If something <u>goes south</u>, it stops working or falls apart. It can also mean that something decreases in value or loses quality. We often use it to describe a situation where everything has gone wrong.</p>
<p>If your career <u>goes south</u>, you need to look for a new job. If your new computer <u>goes south</u>, it stops working. If a relationship <u>goes south</u>, the two people are heading toward a <strong>breakup</strong>.</p>
<p>And if a trip <u>goes south</u>, one bad thing after another happens. You miss your plane, your passport gets stolen, and the hotel loses your <strong>reservation</strong>. That makes for a vacation that has <u>gone south</u>.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear two friends use this expression.</p>
<p><em>A: So, how is your friend's new bakery doing? She opened it earlier this year, right?</em></p>
<p><em>B: She did. But then she ran into trouble. Her investor pulled out. And then her head baker quit. So, her business <u>went south</u> pretty quickly after that. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not surprised. You need a lot of money up front to start a business. And for a bakery ... you definitely need a baker.</em></p>
<p><em>B: Well it didn't help that another bakery with lower prices opened down the street. Her business was bound to <u>go south</u> after that. </em></p>
<p><strong>To go sidesways</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sideways </strong>is another direction you don't want your projects or efforts to go. As a direction word, sideways means to go to either side – not forward or backward.</p>
<p>As an <strong>idiomatic</strong> expression, to <u>go sideways</u> also means things do not go as planned. But this expression can be used a little differently from <u>going south</u>. Often when things <u>go sideways</u>, they go wrong in strange ways. In other words, things get <strong>weird</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want things to <u>go sideways</u>. For example, a good story often <u>goes sideways</u>. You think it's going to go in one direction but then there is a <strong>plot twist</strong>. Situations change and the story goes in an unexpected direction. Used this way, <u>going sideways</u> is a good thing.</p>
<p>But what about on a family camping trip? Let's hear this expression used in that situation.</p>
<p><em>A: How was your family camping trip? </em></p>
<p><em>B: It was okay. But some really strange things happened. Nature things...</em></p>
<p><em>A: Tell me more. What happened?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Well, the first night a raccoon stole all my food. The second night while I slept, spiders spun webs all over my tent while I slept. And then on the third day while I was swimming in the lake, a fish bit me!</em></p>
<p><em>A: That IS a lot of weird nature stuff. I didn't even know fish could bite.</em></p>
<p><em>B: Me neither! But I guess on a camping trip that's <u>gone sideways</u> ... anything is possible!</em></p>
<p>And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories.</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>
