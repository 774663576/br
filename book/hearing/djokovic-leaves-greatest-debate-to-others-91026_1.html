在塞尔维亚选手诺瓦克·德约科维奇创造网球大满贯单打冠军的男子纪录后，一名记者问道：“成为历史上最伟大的男选手感觉如何？”</p>
<p>The Grand Slam is made up of the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open.
大满贯赛事包括澳大利亚网球公开赛、法国网球公开赛、温布尔登网球公开赛和美国网球公开赛。</p>
<p>Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, known as "the Big Three", have won more Grand Slam titles than any other male players. But Nadal did not play in the French Open this year because of injuries. And Federer retired from tennis last year.<br/>
被称为“三巨头”的德约科维奇、纳达尔和费德勒赢得的大满贯冠军比其他任何男性选手都多。但是由于伤病，纳达尔没有参加今年的法网公开赛。而费德勒去年就退役了。</p>
<p>On Sunday, Djokovic won his 23rd Grand Slam title at the French Open by defeating Casper Ruud of Norway. That is one more than Rafael Nadal of Spain with 22 and three more than Roger Federer of Switzerland with 20. Margaret Court of Australia holds the women's record with 24.<br/>
周日，德约科维奇在法国网球公开赛上击败挪威选手卡斯珀·路德，赢得了他的第23个大满贯冠军。这比西班牙选手拉斐尔·纳达尔的22个大满贯冠军多出了一个，比瑞士选手罗杰·费德勒的20个大满贯冠军多出了三个。澳大利亚选手玛格丽特·考特以24个大满贯冠军保持女子纪录。</p>
<p>For years, people have argued over which of the three male tennis players should be thought of as the "GOAT", or the greatest of all time.<br/>
多年来，人们一直在争论三位男网球运动员中哪一位应该被认为是“山羊”，也就是“有史以来最伟大的”。</p>
<p>Djokovic offered his thoughts on the question:<br/>
德约科维奇对这个问题发表了他的看法：</p>
<p>"I mean, I don't want to say that I am the greatest, because I feel — I've said it before — it's disrespectful towards all the great champions in different eras of our sport that was played in a completely different way than it is played today,"<br/>
“我的意思是，我不想妄称自己是最伟大的，我以前也说过，我觉得这种说法对是网球运动不同时代所有伟大冠军们的不尊重，过去的网球与今天大完全不同。”</p>
<p>"So," the 36-year-old from Serbia continued, "I leave those kind[s] of discussions of who is the greatest to someone else."<br/>
这位来自塞尔维亚的36岁男子继续说道，“所以，我把关于谁最伟大的讨论留给别人。”</p>
<p>Djokovic also spoke about his childhood and the support he had during that time.<br/>
德约科维奇还谈到了他的童年以及那段时间他得到的支持。</p>
<p>"Going back to the 1990s when I was four, five years old, and we had [a] couple of wars," Djokovic said. Travel limits meant that Djokovic could not play in some junior tournaments. He added, "My family was on a very low budget. But my parents still decided to support me in my dream."<br/>
德约科维奇说：“回到20世纪90年代，当时我四五岁，我们国家经历了几场战争。”旅行限制意味着德约科维奇不能参加一些青少年锦标赛。他补充道：“我家很穷。但我的父母仍然决定支持我的梦想。”</p>
<p>Talking about his parents, he said they "had to go through a lot of difficulties, financially, emotionally, whichever way, for me to sit here. So I don't forget about that. I actually carry it in my heart."<br/>
谈到他的父母，他说他们“必须经历很多困难，无论是经济上还是情感上，无论以何种方式，才能让我坐到这里。所以我不会忘记这一点。我实际上把它记在心里。”</p>
<p>His parents, Srdan and Dijana, had no tennis background. So Djokovic trained with Jelena Gencic who he called his "tennis mother."<br/>
他的父母斯尔丹和迪亚娜没有网球背景。因此，德约科维奇跟随耶莱娜·根西奇训练，他称她是自己的“网球母亲”。</p>
<p>"She was a true mentor . . . I used to go to her home, and we did many different things that were shaping my mind as a human being," he said.<br/>
他说：“她是一位真正的导师……我过去常去她家，我们做了很多不同的事情，这些事情塑造了我作为人类的思想。”</p>
<p>At age 12, Djokovic moved to Germany, where he spent four years training with Nikola Pilic's.<br/>
12岁时，德约科维奇搬到了德国，在那里他进入尼古拉·皮里奇学院训练了4年。</p>
<p>As for what is coming next, Djokovic said, "I feel if I'm winning Slams, why even think about ending the career that already has been going on for 20 years?"<br/>
至于接下来湖发生什么，德约科维奇说：“我觉得如果我能赢得大满贯，为什么要考虑结束这段已经持续了20年的职业生涯呢？”</p>
<p>"I look forward, already, to Wimbledon," he said.<br/>
他说：“我已经对温网充满期待了。”</p>

。
[00:01.88]"How does it feel to be the greatest male player in history?" a reporter asked
[00:07.52]after Novak Djokovic of Serbia set the male record
[00:11.80]for winning the Grand Slam singles titles in tennis.
[00:16.84]The Grand Slam is made up of the Australian Open,
[00:20.84]the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open.
[00:26.16]Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, known as "the Big Three",
[00:30.32]have won more Grand Slam titles than any other male players.
[00:35.88]But Nadal did not play in the French Open this year because of injuries.
[00:42.00]And Federer retired from tennis last year.
[00:45.68]On Sunday, Djokovic won his 23rd Grand Slam title
[00:50.72]at the French Open by defeating Casper Ruud of Norway.
[00:56.84]That is one more than Rafael Nadal of Spain with 22
[01:01.76]and three more than Roger Federer of Switzerland with 20.
[01:06.88]Margaret Court of Australia holds the women's record with 24.
[01:12.96]For years, people have argued over which of the three male tennis players
[01:17.28]should be thought of as the "GOAT", or the greatest of all time.
[01:22.92]Djokovic offered his thoughts on the question:
[01:26.08]"I mean, I don't want to say that I am the greatest,
[01:29.76]because I feel — I've said it before —
[01:33.28]it's disrespectful towards all the great champions
[01:37.44]in different eras of our sport
[01:40.04]that was played in a completely different way than it is played today,"
[01:45.52]"So," the 36-year-old from Serbia continued,
[01:48.64]"I leave those kind[s]of discussions of
[01:50.84]who is the greatest to someone else."
[01:54.48]Djokovic also spoke about his childhood
[01:57.28]and the support he had during that time.
[02:01.08]"Going back to the 1990s when I was four, five years old,
[02:05.72]and we had a couple of wars," Djokovic said.
[02:10.16]Travel limits meant that Djokovic
[02:12.40]could not play in some junior tournaments.
[02:14.80]He added, "My family was on a very low budget.
[02:18.76]But my parents still decided to support me in my dream."
[02:24.24]Talking about his parents, he said
[02:26.24]they "had to go through a lot of difficulties,
[02:29.00]financially, emotionally, whichever way, for me to sit here.
[02:33.88]So I don't forget about that. I actually carry it in my heart."
[02:39.92]His parents, Srdan and Dijana, had no tennis background.
[02:45.80]So Djokovic trained with Jelena Gencic
[02:48.92]who he called his "tennis mother."
[02:51.92]"She was a true mentor . . . I used to go to her home,
[02:55.44]and we did many different things
[02:57.24]that were shaping my mind as a human being," he said.
[03:01.52]At age 12, Djokovic moved to Germany,
[03:04.72]where he spent four years training with Nikola Pilic's.
[03:09.36]As for what is coming next, Djokovic said,
[03:12.64]"I feel if I'm winning Slams, why even think about ending the career
[03:17.76]that already has been going on for 20 years?"
[03:21.80]"I look forward, already, to Wimbledon," he said.
