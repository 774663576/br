。
[00:01.96]One of the most popular foods
[00:03.68]in South Korea is kimchi.
[00:06.88]It is a kind of fermented cabbage or other vegetables.
[00:11.96]Now farmers, manufacturers and scientists
[00:15.68]say climate change is affecting the quality
[00:18.76]and quantity of the napa cabbage used to make the dish.
[00:24.28]Cabbage grows best in cooler climates.
[00:27.28]Growers usually plant it in mountainous areas
[00:31.12]where temperatures during the summer growing season
[00:34.12]used to stay mostly below 25 degrees Celsius.
[00:39.88]Studies show that warmer weather
[00:42.20]tied to climate change is now threatening these crops.
[00:47.08]There may even come a time
[00:48.84]when it will be too hot for South Korea
[00:51.48]to be able to grow napa cabbage.
[00:54.92]Lee Young-gyu studies diseases that attack plants.
[00:59.04]He said the best temperatures for cabbage
[01:02.24]are between 18 and 21 degrees Celsius.
[01:07.52]In the fields and in kitchens
[01:09.60]- both in factories and homes
[01:11.84]- farmers and kimchi makers
[01:14.40]are already feeling the change.
[01:17.72]Spicy, fermented kimchi
[01:19.92]is made from other vegetables
[01:21.72]such as radish, cucumber, and green onion,
[01:25.24]but the most popular form is still mostly cabbage.
[01:30.36]The Agriculture Ministry
[01:32.24]calls Lee Ha-yeon a Kimchi Master
[01:35.56]because of her knowledge of kimchi.
[01:38.92]She said that in higher temperatures,
[01:41.40]the heart of the cabbage goes bad,
[01:43.60]and the root softens.
[01:46.72]"If this continues, then in the summertime
[01:49.84]we might have to give up cabbage kimchi," said Lee.
[01:54.36]The government statistics agency reports
[01:57.32]the area of highland cabbage farmed last year
[02:00.92]was about 4,000 hectares.
[02:04.80]That is less than half of what it was 20 years ago.
[02:09.68]The Rural Development Administration,
[02:12.04]a state farming organization,
[02:14.52]predicts that the farmed area for napa cabbage
[02:17.88]will shrink in the next 25 years
[02:20.68]to just 44 hectares.
[02:23.96]They expect there will be no cabbage
[02:25.92]grown in the highlands by 2090.
[02:29.40]Researchers point to three reasons
[02:31.56]for such a small area of crops.
[02:34.88]They include higher temperatures,
[02:37.12]unpredictable heavy rains
[02:39.32]and unwanted insects and diseases
[02:42.68]that become more difficult
[02:44.44]to control in the warmer and longer summers.
[02:48.64]South Korea's kimchi industry
[02:51.04]is already fighting lower-priced imports from China,
[02:54.64]which are mostly served in restaurants.
[02:58.12]Those imports rose by almost
[03:00.48]seven percent for the year
[03:02.32]through the end of July.
[03:05.08]That is the highest level ever.
[03:07.48]The government is trying to prevent
[03:10.16]high prices and shortages
[03:12.16]by storing large amounts of cabbage.
[03:15.80]Scientists are also racing to develop crop varieties
[03:19.52]that can grow in warmer climates,
[03:21.84]handle changes in rainfall
[03:24.24]and resist fungal infections.
[03:28.20]Seventy-one-year-old Kim Si-gap
[03:31.20]is a farmer who has worked in the cabbage fields
[03:34.60]of the eastern region of Gangneung all his life.
[03:39.16]Kim fears these varieties
[03:41.04]will be more costly to grow.
[03:43.16]And they might not taste the same.
[03:46.64]"When we see the reports
[03:48.16]that there will come a time in Korea
[03:50.44]when we can no longer grow cabbage,
[03:52.56]it was shocking on the one hand
[03:55.04]and also sad at the same time," Kim said.
[03:59.60]"Kimchi is something we cannot
[04:01.92]not have on the table.
[04:04.76]What are we going to do if this happens?"
