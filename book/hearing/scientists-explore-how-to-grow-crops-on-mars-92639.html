。
[00:00.04]For future humans to survive long periods on Mars,
[00:04.60]growing food on the planet is a must.
[00:08.08]It would be too costly and risky
[00:11.16]to rely upon rocket deliveries
[00:13.48]to meet the food needs of colonists.
[00:16.12]With this in mind,
[00:17.76]scientists are exploring ways to improve space farming.
[00:23.92]At Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands,
[00:28.24]researchers work in a controlled greenhouse.
[00:31.76]They have identified a way
[00:34.12]that could improve crop production
[00:36.36]in simulated Martian soil,
[00:38.40]with different crops grown together.
[00:42.00]The method is called "intercropping."
[00:44.48]It was first invented by ancient Maya farmers
[00:48.12]in what is now Central America.
[00:51.40]In their experiments,
[00:52.88]the researchers grew cherry tomatoes,
[00:55.60]peas and carrots together in small,
[00:58.76]round containers called pots.
[01:01.28]Tomatoes grown in this way
[01:04.12]produced about double the amount
[01:06.16]of tomatoes grown alone - or "monocropped" -
[01:09.68]in the same simulated Martian soil.
[01:13.68]The tomatoes were also bigger.
[01:16.04]They flowered and matured earlier,
[01:18.84]gave more fruit per plant and had thicker stems.
[01:24.32]The amounts of peas and carrots
[01:26.92]did not increase with intercropping.
[01:31.00]Rebeca Goncalves is an astrobiologist
[01:34.68]and lead writer of the study
[01:36.64]published on Wednesday
[01:38.28]in the publication PLOS ONE.
[01:41.04]She said the research is the first time
[01:43.76]the intercropping technique
[01:45.40]was used in space soil.
[01:49.00]"And the fact that it worked really well
[01:51.56]for one out of the three species
[01:53.84]was a big find,
[01:55.44]one that we can now build
[01:57.32]further research on," Goncalves added.
[02:02.08]The crops were grown in simulated Martian regolith,
[02:05.80]a soil with no organic matter.
[02:09.40]Created by researchers
[02:11.08]from the American space agency NASA,
[02:13.68]it is a near-perfect physical
[02:15.96]and chemical match to real Martian soil.
[02:20.24]The researchers added useful bacteria and nutrients.
[02:24.48]They also controlled the gases,
[02:27.48]temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse
[02:31.32]to match conditions expected in a Martian greenhouse.
[02:36.96]For now, human bases on Mars
[02:39.64]are only seen in movies.
[02:41.72]But NASA, for example,
[02:43.96]is developing ways to send
[02:46.08]people to Mars in the 2030s.
[02:50.88]"Mars is really far away.
[02:53.12]A flight now would take about nine months.
[02:56.20]If you want to live there as humans,

[03:02.08]said study co-writer Wieger Wamelink.
[03:05.72]He is a plant ecologist at Wageningen
[03:09.00]and head of B.A.S.E.,
[03:11.12]a company that develops lunar and Martian greenhouses.

[03:18.56]and also vulnerable...
[03:19.84]Our main goal is to use as much as possible
[03:23.20]from the resources at the site," he added.
[03:27.80]Intercropping involves growing plants
[03:30.32]with properties that could help each other grow.

[03:43.48]may have benefited from being close

[03:49.36]good at turning nitrogen from the air,
[03:51.88]with the help of bacteria introduced into the soil,
[03:55.40]into an important nutrient.
[03:58.80]The carrots produced fewer crops from intercropping
[04:02.12]and the peas had no change, Goncalves said.

[04:09.60]the crop species that you combine,

[04:26.56]by taking light from it," Wamelink added.
[04:30.48]Overall, the tomatoes, peas and carrots grew well,
[04:34.28]though not as well as in Earth soil
[04:36.80]in the same greenhouse.
