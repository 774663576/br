<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:US, Britain Clash Over Farming Issues During Trade Talks]

。
[00:00.04]Britain and the United States
[00:01.84]have opened exploratory talks on a trade agreement.
[00:07.04]Such an agreement would take effect
[00:09.68]after Britain officially leaves the European Union.
[00:14.80]The withdrawal, known as Brexit, is set for March 29.
[00:21.56]Sharp differences have arisen between British
[00:24.71]and U.S. officials over agricultural issues.
[00:28.76]Britain is resisting U.S. demands to open its markets
[00:34.47]to farm products currently banned under EU law.
[00:39.96]The most widely reported example
[00:42.88]is Europe's import ban on American "chlorinated chicken."
[00:48.52]In the United States, the meat processing industry
[00:52.61]washes chickens in chlorine to remove harmful bacteria.
[00:58.40]Europe says that an over-dependence on chlorine
[01:03.48]lowers overall production and cleanliness on poultry farms.
[01:09.64]U.S. officials are disputing the claim.
[01:14.00]The European Union has also
[01:16.23]banned imports of meat from American cows
[01:19.20]that have been treated with artificial growth hormones.
[01:24.12]Natural hormones control growth in animal or plant cells.
[01:29.92]American farmers use artificial hormones
[01:34.20]to increase the size of animals or to increase milk production.
[01:40.48]But EU officials warn that one commonly used
[01:44.73]growth hormone may cause cancer.
[01:48.72]They add there is not enough scientific information
[01:52.75]on other hormones to approve their use in food.
[01:57.44]U.S. officials have made it clear
[02:01.17]that any future trade deal with Britain
[02:04.36]must see these food bans dropped.
[02:09.48]Former U.S. lawmaker Darrell Issa
[02:12.28]is President Donald Trump's choice
[02:15.17]to lead the U.S. government's Trade and Development Agency.
[02:20.96]Issa says that the millions of Britons
[02:24.04]visiting the United States every year enjoy perfectly safe food.
[02:29.92]"We'd like to have that arrangement being one in which,
[02:34.22]in Britain, you can choose to have American chicken, American beef,
[02:38.21]or other agricultural products,
[02:41.20]just as you could when you come to the United States.
[02:43.80]It is a key lynchpin of an agreement.
[02:47.32]Financial, manufacturing and agriculture have to be free and fair."
[02:54.76]The U.S. ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson,
[02:58.60]recently wrote about the issue in Britain's The Telegraph newspaper.
[03:04.84]He attacked what he called "myths" over American farming,
[03:10.00]claiming they are part of an effort
[03:12.23]to protect the interests of British farmers.
[03:16.56]Britain has repeatedly said that it will not lower
[03:20.08]food quality rules after it leaves the EU.
[03:25.04]In answer to Ambassador Johnson's comments,
[03:28.48]British international trade minister Liam Fox
[03:32.25]said his country would not compromise.
[03:36.36]Fox spoke to the British Broadcasting Corporation.
[03:40.84]"Will we accept things that we believe are
[03:43.19]against the interests of our consumers
[03:45.44]or our producers? No, we won't. It's a negotiation."
[03:48.44]The dispute over American meat imports
[03:51.28]is also influencing debate over the Irish border,
[03:55.36]a major issue in Britain's attempt to cancel its EU membership.
[04:03.12]British and EU officials want to avoid
[04:06.88]border inspections between Northern Ireland,
[04:10.28]which is part of Britain,
[04:11.72]and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.
[04:16.56]Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar recently expressed fears
[04:22.04]that the border could open a back door into the EU.
[04:27.44]In other words, EU members might import products
[04:31.92]that fail to meet their food safety requirements.
[04:37.00]Varadkar told reporters,
[04:39.32]"If at some point in the future the United Kingdom
[04:42.44]were to allow chlorinated chicken
[04:44.77]or beef with hormones into their markets,
[04:47.68]we wouldn't want that coming into our markets
[04:50.40]or the European Union as well."
[04:54.32]The United States says a trade deal
[04:57.33]would help British industries, like financial services.
[05:02.72]And Britain appears interested in strengthening its position
[05:06.89]in the post-Brexit world as an international trading power.
[05:12.76]I'm Jonathan Evans.
