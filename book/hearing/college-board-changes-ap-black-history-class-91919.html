。
[00:02.08]High school students in the United States
[00:05.28]can earn college credits by taking
[00:08.64]and passing Advanced Placement (AP) courses.
[00:14.68]The classes, developed by The College Board,
[00:18.44]cover many subjects, including English,
[00:22.36]history, math, and sciences among others.
[00:29.32]This week, the non-profit organization
[00:32.48]released a new set of ideas and skills,
[00:36.52]called a framework,
[00:38.24]for its AP African American Studies course.
[00:43.60]The latest version comes months after the organization
[00:48.16]was criticized for discussing course requirements
[00:52.20]with conservative critics.
[00:56.00]Changes include more attention to ideas
[00:59.72]such as the Tulsa Race Massacre,
[01:02.88]Black culture's influence on film and sports,
[01:07.00]and discrimination in housing, known as redlining.
[01:11.84]The latest version will be used
[01:14.64]when the class officially launches
[01:17.20]at the start of the next school year.
[01:21.00]The AP African American History course
[01:24.44]gained national attention earlier this year.
[01:28.24]At that time, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis,
[01:33.24]currently a Republican presidential candidate,
[01:36.84]said he would ban the course in his state
[01:40.76]because it pushed political issues.
[01:45.00]Florida released a list of concerns it had
[01:48.88]with the pilot, an early version of a course.
[01:54.60]In February, the College Board released
[01:57.96]its first official version of the AP course.
[02:02.40]It did not contain several subjects
[02:05.64]on the list of Florida's concerns,
[02:08.16]including Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations
[02:12.56]and several important Black writers.
[02:17.36]The board was then widely criticized
[02:20.72]for giving in to political pressure.
[02:23.72]The new changes pay attention
[02:26.60]to some of that criticism.
[02:30.28]The latest version includes several important
[02:33.88]Black writers that were excluded,
[02:36.68]and written works about feminism and intersectionality.
[02:41.52]Intersectionality is the idea that race,
[02:45.68]gender, and class combine to create
[02:49.60]different levels of discrimination and privilege in society.
[02:55.68]The College Board did not add back every subject
[02:59.64]that was removed earlier.
[03:02.36]The Black Lives Matter movement is still not included
[03:06.84]in the final test for the course.
[03:10.56]However, it is mentioned along with other examples
[03:14.72]and listed among subjects
[03:17.04]that schools could choose from for further discussion.
[03:22.68]Nelva Williams is a member
[03:25.04]of the course's development committee.
[03:27.84]She has been a teacher for more than 40 years.
[03:32.32]She also taught a pilot class
[03:35.56]of AP African American Studies in Houston, Texas.
[03:41.32]Williams said, "The updates
[03:43.76]are based on teacher recommendations,
[03:46.48]and changes coincide with the latest scholarship
[03:50.64]and resources used at the collegiate level."
[03:56.40]Rashad Shabazz teaches several courses
[04:00.00]related to race at Arizona State University.
[04:04.44]He said the course provides students with the basics
[04:08.56]to understand the field of African-American studies.
[04:12.76]But it does not contain in-depth theoretical discussions
[04:17.16]that are more common at the college level.
[04:21.36]Next year, the AP course will be available
[04:25.08]to all schools in the U.S.
[04:27.92]But it remains unclear how many will offer it.
[04:32.84]Holly Stepp, a spokesperson for the College Board,
[04:36.68]said they are pleased with the interest
[04:39.28]that has been expressed in the course.
