<p>Health officials in the American state of Alaska have known for nine years about a virus causing rare, mild illness. But a recent case that resulted in a man's death has brought new attention to what is being called the Alaskapox virus.</p>
<p>Here's some background on the virus:</p>
<p><strong>What is Alaskapox?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by the Alaska Department of Health shows several Alaskapox lesions.

<p>Alaskapox belongs to the family of orthopoxviruses that can infect animals and humans. These viruses usually cause <strong>lesions</strong>, or pox, on the skin. Some are more dangerous than others.</p>
<p>Smallpox is the best-known member of the orthopoxvirus family. Others include camelpox, cowpox, horsepox and mpox (formerly known as m<i><i>onkey</i></i>pox).</p>
<p>Alaskapox was discovered in 2015 in a woman who lived near Fairbanks, Alaska. It mainly has been found in small mammals, including red-backed voles and shrews. But house animals, such as dogs and cats, can carry the virus, health officials say.</p>
<p>Seven people in Alaska have become infected with it in the last nine years.</p>
<p>People with Alaskapox have developed one or more bumps on the skin. They also experience joint, or muscle pain and <strong>swollen</strong> parts of the body called lymph nodes.</p>
<p>Nearly all patients had <strong>mild</strong> sickness that went away after a few weeks. But people with weak <strong>immune systems</strong> can be at risk of more severe sickness.</p>
<p>Officials believe Alaskapox spreads through contact with infected animals.</p>
<p>There has been no documented case of it spreading from one person to another. But other viruses in the same family can spread when one person comes in contact with another person's lesions.</p>
<p>So, Alaskan health officials are advising anyone with an Alaskapox lesion to cover it with a bandage.</p>
<p><strong>What happened in the latest case?</strong></p>
<p>Alaska health officials say there have been seven people infected with Alaskapox since the virus was discovered. But the latest case represents the first time someone is known to have died from it.</p>
<p>The older man lived on the Kenai Peninsula. He was being treated for cancer and had a suppressed immune system because of the drugs. In September, he found a red sore under his right armpit and saw doctors over the next two months because of tiredness and burning pain. Alaska public health officials said he was hospitalized in November and died last month.</p>
<p>The man lived in a forested area away from any town and did not travel. They said he had been repeatedly <strong>scratched</strong> by a cat that hunted small animals, and one of the scratches was in the area of the man's armpit, officials said.</p>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself?</strong></p>
<p>Health officials believe that Alaskapox is rare.</p>
<p>That said, wildlife can carry infection risks and should not be kept at home. The best way to keep pets and family members safe is to keep a safe distance and wash your hands after being outdoors.</p>

[00:00.04]Health officials in the American state of Alaska
[00:04.84]have known for nine years
[00:07.04]about a virus causing rare, mild illness.
[00:12.68]But a recent case that resulted in a man's death
[00:17.44]has brought new attention
[00:19.76]to what is being called the Alaskapox virus.
[00:24.64]Here's some background on the virus:
[00:28.56]Alaskapox belongs to the family of orthopoxviruses
[00:35.00]that can infect animals and humans.
[00:39.00]These viruses usually cause lesions,
[00:43.76]or pox, on the skin.
[00:46.20]Some are more dangerous than others.
[00:50.44]Smallpox is the best-known member
[00:54.00]of the orthopoxvirus family.
[00:57.92]Others include camelpox, cowpox, horsepox
[01:04.40]and mpox (formerly known as monkeypox).
[01:10.48]Alaskapox was discovered in 2015
[01:15.16]in a woman who lived near Fairbanks, Alaska.
[01:19.24]It mainly has been found in small mammals,
[01:23.68]including red-backed voles and shrews.
[01:28.40]But house animals, such as dogs and cats,
[01:32.88]can carry the virus, health officials say.
[01:37.96]Seven people in Alaska
[01:40.60]have become infected with it
[01:43.08]in the last nine years.
[01:45.64]People with Alaskapox
[01:48.76]have developed one or more bumps on the skin.
[01:52.96]They also experience joint, or muscle pain
[01:57.72]and swollen parts of the body called lymph nodes.
[02:03.12]Nearly all patients had mild sickness
[02:06.96]that went away after a few weeks.
[02:10.44]But people with weak immune systems
[02:14.52]can be at risk of more severe sickness.
[02:18.48]Officials believe Alaskapox spreads
[02:22.36]through contact with infected animals.
[02:27.56]There has been no documented case of it spreading
[02:31.48]from one person to another.
[02:35.08]But other viruses in the same family
[02:38.36]can spread when one person comes in contact
[02:42.72]with another person's lesions.
[02:46.16]So, Alaskan health officials
[02:49.84]are advising anyone with an Alaskapox lesion
[02:54.44]to cover it with a bandage.
[02:58.52]Alaska health officials say
[03:01.24]there have been seven people infected
[03:04.20]with Alaskapox since the virus was discovered.
[03:09.60]But the latest case represents the first time
[03:13.64]someone is known to have died from it.
[03:17.80]The older man lived on the Kenai Peninsula.
[03:22.24]He was being treated for cancer
[03:25.96]and had a suppressed immune system
[03:29.44]because of the drugs.
[03:32.48]In September, he found a red sore
[03:36.00]under his right armpit
[03:38.00]and saw doctors over the next two months
[03:41.80]because of tiredness and burning pain.
[03:46.40]Alaska public health officials said
[03:49.68]he was hospitalized in November
[03:53.04]and died last month.
[03:56.56]The man lived in a forested area
[03:59.60]away from any town and did not travel.
[04:04.28]They said he had been repeatedly scratched
[04:07.48]by a cat that hunted small animals,
[04:11.52]and one of the scratches was in the area
[04:15.44]of the man's armpit, officials said.
[04:19.36]Health officials believe that Alaskapox is rare.
[04:24.32]That said, wildlife can carry infection risks
[04:30.12]and should not be kept at home.
[04:33.52]The best way to keep pets and family members safe
[04:37.64]is to keep a safe distance
[04:40.44]and wash your hands after being outdoors.
