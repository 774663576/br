。
[00:01.20]New research from the American
[00:03.56]non-profit organization Consumer Reports
[00:07.72]finds that plastics have a "widespread" presence in food.
[00:14.48]The group called on the United States government
[00:18.88]to examine the safety of food that comes into contact
[00:23.44]with plastics during production.
[00:26.84]In a report released Thursday, Consumer Reports
[00:31.00]said that 84 out of 85 food products it recently tested
[00:36.76]contained "plasticizers" called phthalates.
[00:41.44]Phthalates are chemicals used to make plastic last longer.
[00:48.20]The tested food came from supermarkets and restaurants.
[00:53.28]The researchers also said 79 percent
[00:57.56]of the foods examined contained bisphenol A (BPA),
[01:04.20]another chemical found in plastic,
[01:07.32]and other bisphenols.
[01:10.16]But levels were lower than in tests done in 2009.
[01:16.72]Consumer Reports said all the phthalate levels
[01:20.76]were within limits set by U.S. and European regulators.
[01:27.16]However, this does not mean the chemicals are safe to eat.
[01:31.80]Deciding acceptable levels
[01:34.36]for such chemicals in food is tricky.
[01:37.76]Officials in the U.S. and Europe have set limits
[01:42.12]for only bisphenol A (BPA) and a few phthalates.
[01:46.72]All the foods tested remained
[01:49.08]within the limits, the experts said.
[01:51.96]However, does that mean it is safe to eat?
[01:56.36]The researchers say no.
[01:58.52]Tunde Akinleye was the lead scientist in the food testing.
[02:04.36]He says many of the limits on the chemicals
[02:08.40]are not in line with the most
[02:10.76]current scientific knowledge, he reported.
[02:14.04]"We don't feel comfortable
[02:16.48]saying these levels are okay," Akinleye said.
[02:21.44]Phthalates and bisphenols can interfere
[02:24.80]with the body's production and release of estrogen
[02:28.68]and other hormones.
[02:30.52]That can lead to increased risk of birth defects,
[02:34.72]cancer, diabetes, reproductive problems,
[02:38.68]developmental disorders, and other health conditions.
[02:43.84]Among the tested supermarket foods,
[02:46.88]Annie's Organic Cheesy Ravioli
[02:49.92]contained the most phthalates.
[02:52.64]Del Monte peaches and Chicken of the Sea
[02:56.12]pink salmon also were high in phthalates.
[03:00.72]Increased phthalate levels were also found
[03:03.44]in products including Cheerios,
[03:05.96]Gerber baby food and Yoplait yogurt.
[03:09.88]And the researchers found increased levels
[03:13.28]in hamburger, chicken and potatoes
[03:16.48]from fast food restaurants
[03:18.48]Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonald's.
[03:21.96]Consumer Reports also found some wide differences
[03:25.36]in levels among similar products.
[03:28.56]For example, some chicken from McDonald's
[03:31.80]contained four times more phthalates
[03:34.32]than a similar chicken product from Wendy's.
[03:37.92]"That tells us that,
[03:40.48]as widespread as these chemicals are,
[03:43.32]there are ways to reduce how much is in our foods,"
[03:47.20]said James Rogers.
[03:49.20]He supervises Consumer Reports' product safety testing.
[03:54.68]Polar raspberry lime seltzer
[03:57.28]was the only tested product containing no phthalates.
[04:01.76]General Mills produces brands
[04:04.40]including Annie's, Cheerios and Yoplait.
[04:08.00]The company did not immediately
[04:10.04]answer requests for comment.
[04:12.20]Burger King and Wendy's also
[04:14.84]did not immediately answer such requests.
[04:18.52]Chicken of the Sea and Del Monte said
[04:21.64]they do not add phthalates to their food,
[04:24.28]and that their suppliers guarantee the same.
[04:27.72]Del Monte added that phthalates
[04:30.08]are "widespread in the environment."
[04:33.12]Gerber and McDonald's said they follow government rules
[04:37.52]connected to their products
[04:39.72]and require testing for food packaging as well.
