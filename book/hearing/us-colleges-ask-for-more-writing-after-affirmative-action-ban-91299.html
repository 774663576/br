<p>However, some colleges and universities that accept the Common Application are asking students to send in an extra piece of writing. They are using the extra "<strong>prompt</strong>" to give students a chance to discuss their background.</p>

<p>The first question permits students to write about a time they discussed an important issue with someone holding an opposing view.</p>
<p>Another question asks students to discuss a meaningful community to which they are connected.</p>
<p>But a third question is new, compared to past years. It asks students to talk about part of their "personal experience that you feel will <strong>enrich</strong> your college."</p>
<p>That question permits a student to state their race and discuss how they would add something special to the group of students at Yale.</p>
<p>At Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, a new prompt asks students to "tell about a community that you have been part of where your <strong>participation</strong> helped to change or shape the community for the better."</p>
<p>Timothy Fields is a top admissions official at Emory. He said the new questions "are going to be much more targeted."</p>
<p>At Sarah Lawrence College outside of New York City, a new question asks students how the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action might affect their lives.</p>

<p>"The general feeling with school counselors right now is mostly <strong>anxiety</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>But those who work with students, like private admissions counselor Shereem Herndon-Brown, say students should not overstate how race affects their lives.</p>
<p>Herndon-Brown wrote a book with Fields, the admissions leader at Emory. He said students need to write "<strong>authentically</strong>" about how they think and have developed as a result of their background.</p>
<p>He gave an example of a Black student from New York who recently visited relatives in the southern part of the U.S. Herndon-Brown encouraged the student to write about that experience although it was not in the student's original plan.</p>
<p>That he said, is a better idea than declaring their race or overstating their disadvantage.</p>

。
[00:00.00]August 1 is the start of the new
[00:03.12]college admissions season in the United States.
[00:06.52]It is the day students can start
[00:08.96]to complete the Common Application
[00:10.96]for college admission in 2024.
[00:14.32]The Common Application is accepted
[00:17.92]by over 1,000 colleges and universities.
[00:22.40]The service permits students to apply to many schools
[00:27.04]by submitting their information only one time.
[00:31.20]However, some colleges and universities
[00:34.20]that accept the Common Application
[00:36.68]are asking students to send in an extra piece of writing.
[00:41.56]They are using the extra "prompt"
[00:44.92]to give students a chance to discuss their background.
[00:49.16]The reason for this new writing prompt
[00:52.04]is the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision
[00:56.48]to end affirmative action in college decisions.
[01:02.08]The court said selective colleges and universities,
[01:06.88]such as Harvard University
[01:09.20]or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
[01:13.20]can no longer use race as a way
[01:15.32]to decide between two qualified students.
[01:18.84]But the court did say
[01:20.92]schools can consider "an applicant's
[01:23.60]discussion of how race affected his or her life…"
[01:28.44]That is why some schools are re-writing their prompts.
[01:33.20]At Yale University,
[01:35.12]students who apply with the Common Application
[01:38.76]must also answer one of three questions.
[01:43.24]The first question permits students to write about a time
[01:47.00]they discussed an important issue
[01:49.44]with someone holding an opposing view.
[01:53.00]Another question asks students
[01:56.16]to discuss a meaningful community
[01:58.72]to which they are connected.
[02:01.44]But a third question is new,
[02:03.72]compared to past years.
[02:06.60]It asks students
[02:08.48]to talk about part of their "personal experience
[02:12.04]that you feel will enrich your college."
[02:16.40]That question permits a student to state their race
[02:20.72]and discuss how they would add something special
[02:24.00]to the group of students at Yale.
[02:27.48]At Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia,
[02:31.28]a new prompt asks students
[02:34.04]to "tell about a community
[02:36.12]that you have been part of where
[02:38.36]your participation helped to change
[02:41.84]or shape the community for the better."
[02:45.44]Timothy Fields is a top admissions official at Emory.
[02:50.60]He said the new questions
[02:52.72]"are going to be much more targeted."
[02:55.84]At Sarah Lawrence College outside of New York City,
[02:59.88]a new question asks students
[03:02.56]how the Supreme Court decision
[03:04.88]on affirmative action might affect their lives.
[03:09.92]Kevin McKenna is a vice president at the college.
[03:14.16]He said the new question
[03:16.60]gives students a chance to discuss the decision
[03:20.20]"that could impact the student bodies of the colleges
[03:23.88]to which they are applying."
[03:26.84]In addition to the new questions,
[03:29.64]many colleges and universities are thinking
[03:32.40]about how to connect with Black and Latino students.
[03:37.32]The school leaders worry that those students
[03:40.60]may think they are no longer welcome
[03:42.88]at selective universities
[03:45.24]after the Supreme Court decision.
[03:48.92]Amin Abdul-Malik Gonzale is the top admissions official
[03:54.16]at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.
[03:57.52]He and his team are planning extra time at high schools
[04:02.16]and more meetings at college information events
[04:06.92]to tell minority students they are still welcome.
[04:12.80]He also will offer more training to his admissions officers
[04:17.52]so they can work to build a diverse group of students
[04:20.68]without going against the Supreme Court's decision.
[04:25.56]Visits such as those by the Wesleyan team are important,
[04:29.60]said Angel Perez.
[04:32.20]He is head of the National Association
[04:35.32]for College Admission Counseling.
[04:38.28]Perez said some college counselors
[04:41.32]for high school students are uncertain
[04:45.16]how their students should address their race in applications.
[04:51.08]"The general feeling with school counselors right now
[04:55.04]is mostly anxiety," he said.
[04:58.12]But those who work with students,
[05:00.56]like private admissions counselor Shereem Herndon-Brown,
[05:05.32]say students should not overstate how race affects their lives.
[05:11.48]Herndon-Brown wrote a book with Fields,
[05:14.04]the admissions leader at Emory.
[05:17.84]He said students need to write "authentically"
[05:21.52]about how they think and have developed
[05:24.04]as a result of their background.
[05:27.48]He gave an example of a Black student from New York
[05:31.28]who recently visited relatives in the southern part of the U.S.
[05:36.76]Herndon-Brown encouraged the student
[05:39.52]to write about that experience
[05:42.12]although it was not in the student's original plan.
[05:46.60]That he said, is a better idea
[05:49.52]than declaring their race
[05:51.20]or overstating their disadvantage.
[05:55.40]"There is no way to trick an admissions officer or a school
[06:00.64]into believing you're something that you're not," he says.
