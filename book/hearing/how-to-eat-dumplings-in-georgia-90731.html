。
[00:00.04]In the Caucasus Mountains nation of Georgia,
[00:03.92]dumpling-eating is a serious activity.
[00:08.36]"I'm not Georgian,
[00:09.84]but the first rule I learnt
[00:12.16]when I came to Georgia
[00:13.96]was how to eat khinkali,"
[00:16.24]says Sergei Shirinsky.
[00:18.88]He says he is now a dumpling expert.
[00:23.12]Georgian khinkali is a national symbol
[00:26.88]and source of pride.
[00:28.72]It is usually filled
[00:30.80]with a mix of raw ground beef and pork,
[00:34.36]as well as herbs and spices.
[00:37.12]It is then boiled and served hot.
[00:41.40]Khinkali is also the reason
[00:43.68]behind many mealtime debates.
[00:47.68]"You should know that it's eaten with hands only.
[00:50.68]That's the first rule," Shirinsky says.
[00:55.16]Usually, eaters hold a single khinkali by its base.
[00:59.72]Its base is a collection of dough
[01:02.60]brought together during the folding process
[01:05.92]to bring the dumpling together.
[01:08.36]Then, eaters bite into the soft underside,
[01:12.56]being sure to eat any juices in the process.
[01:17.68]The second rule is no condiments –-
[01:20.44]things added to give food a stronger taste.
[01:25.56]"If you add something other than pepper
[01:28.12]you can go to prison in Georgia," Shirinsky jokes.
[01:33.64]The exact beginnings of
[01:35.72]the dumpling in Georgia are unclear.
[01:38.88]But khinkali has been prepared in towns
[01:42.32]and villages across the country for centuries.
[01:46.44]Different areas of the country
[01:49.40]still argue over who invented it
[01:52.16]and who makes it best.
[01:55.36]Modern versions include
[01:57.28]a variety of different stuffing choices
[02:00.28]like Georgian sulguni cheese,
[02:02.92]mushrooms and potatoes.
[02:06.36]Khinkali-making has also become popular
[02:09.48]among the millions of tourists
[02:11.72]that visit the country every year.
[02:15.28]In the capital Tbilisi,
[02:17.28]retired doctor Irina Djandieri
[02:20.40]offers cooking classes in her living room.
[02:24.40]"It's fun, it's fascinating
[02:26.68]and in the end it is very tasty," she says.
[02:31.44]"Every week
[02:32.36]we have a khinkali day in our family...
[02:35.36]It's a great excuse
[02:37.20]to gather with friends and relatives,"
[02:39.76]says Christine Mamasakhlisi.
[02:42.60]She is a dance teacher from Tbilisi.
[02:46.72]"Everything revolves
[02:48.04]around khinkali here," she says.
[02:50.36]"This is not just a dish,
[02:52.76]it's an integral part of Georgian culture
[02:56.24]and identity."
