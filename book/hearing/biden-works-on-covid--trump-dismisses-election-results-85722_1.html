美国当选总统拜登正在迅速建立自己未来的政府以及讨论政策问题。当此之际，川普总统继续不承认选举结果，采取法律行动并要求重新计票。
<p>Speaking Monday from Wilmington, Delaware, Biden said, "This election is over. It's time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric."
拜登周一在特拉华州威尔明顿市发表讲话时表示：“这次大选已经尘埃落定。现在是时候抛弃党派立场和刺耳言论了。”</p>
<p>He also spoke about the COVID-19 health crisis. "It doesn't matter your party, your point of view," he said. "We can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives — American lives."<br/>
他还谈到了新冠肺炎健康危机。他说：“不管你是什么党派，持什么观点。如果大家在未来几个月里能戴上口罩，我们就可以挽救数万人的性命。我不是说的民主党人或共和党人的性命，而是美国人的性命。”</p>
<p>Biden said, "the goal is to get back to normal as fast as possible." He cheered the results announced of Pfizer's vaccine trial as "great news." But he warned that it would be many more months before the vaccine is widely available.<br/>
拜登表示：“我们的目标是尽快恢复正常。”他为辉瑞公司宣布的疫苗试验结果感到高兴，称这是“重大新闻。”但是他警告说，这种疫苗的广泛使用还需要好几个月的时间。</p>
<p>Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have been meeting with 13 scientists and public health experts expected to lead the next administration's COVID-19 effort. The group includes former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Yale University public health care expert Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith.<br/>
拜登和当选副总统卡马拉·哈里斯已经会见了13名科学家和公共卫生专家，这些人预期将在下届政府中主导新冠肺炎的抗疫工作。这群人包括前卫生部长维维克·穆尔西博士、前食品和药物管理局局长大卫·凯斯勒博士以及耶鲁大学公共卫生专家马塞拉·努涅斯-史密斯博士。</p>
<p>Besides fighting COVID-19, Biden and Harris said the goals of the new administration include economic recovery, racial equality and new climate change policies.<br/>
拜登和哈马斯表示，除了对抗新冠肺炎，新政府的目标还包括经济复苏、种族平等和新的气候变化政策。</p>
<p>During the campaign, Biden repeatedly said he will return the United States to the Paris climate agreement and support the World Health Organization. He also promised to revisit the Iranian nuclear agreement and rebuild relations with NATO allies.<br/>
在竞选期间，拜登一再表示，他将带领美国重返巴黎气候协定，并支持世界卫生组织。他还承诺重新签订伊朗核协议，并重建与北约盟国的关系。</p>

川普竞选委员会目前一直不承认选举结果，并称：“这次大选还远没有结束。”它称周一将会开始法庭辩论，“以确保选举法得到充分遵守，并且合法胜选者能够就任。”有些州的法院已经驳回了多起关于大选的诉讼。</p>
<p>President Trump is facing increasing pressure to concede the election.<br/>
川普总统正面临承认这次大选的越来越大的压力。</p>
<p>On Sunday, George W. Bush, the only living Republican former president called Biden and Harris to congratulate them on their victory.

I offered him the same thing I offered Presidents Trump and Obama: my prayers for his success, and my pledge to help in any way I can."<br/>
周日，唯一在世的共和党前总统小布什致电拜恩和哈里斯，祝贺他们胜选。小布什在声明中表示：“当选总统一再说明，虽然他作为民主党人参选，但他将为所有的美国人执政。就像当时对待川普和奥巴马总统一样，我祝福他取得成功，并承诺尽我所能提供帮助。”</p>
