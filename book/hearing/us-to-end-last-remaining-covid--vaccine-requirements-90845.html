<p>The government has also begun the process of lifting vaccination requirements for some educators, healthcare workers, and noncitizens at U.S. land borders.</p>
<p>The Biden administration's COVID-19 coordinator, Dr. Ashish Jha, recently spoke to the Associated Press (AP).

<p>The CDC says more than 270 million people in the U.S., or just over 81 percent of the population, have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>For more than a year, U.S. health officials have been considering how to create a long-term plan of action to fight COVID-19.

<p>Currently, U.S. officials say fewer than 56 million people in the U.S., or about 17 percent of the population, have received one shot of the latest COVID-19 vaccine to be developed.</p>
<p>Jha dismissed concerns that ending the international travel vaccination requirement would increase the risk of a new variant from overseas entering the U.S. Biden has already reduced virus testing requirements for both American citizens and foreign travelers to the U.S.</p>

[00:00.04]The administration of President Joe Biden
[00:03.92]says it will end most remaining
[00:07.36]federal COVID-19 vaccine requirements on May 11.
[00:13.84]That date was chosen in February
[00:17.20]by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
[00:21.24]to end the country's Public Health Emergency for COVID-19.
[00:28.08]Vaccine requirements for federal workers and federal contractors
[00:34.12]will end on May 11.
[00:36.68]In addition, foreign air travelers to the United States
[00:41.64]will no longer be subject to existing vaccination rules, or mandates.
[00:48.72]The government has also begun the process
[00:52.76]of lifting vaccination requirements for some educators,
[00:57.88]healthcare workers, and noncitizens at U.S. land borders.
[01:05.08]The Biden administration's COVID-19 coordinator,
[01:09.88]Dr. Ashish Jha, recently spoke to the Associated Press (AP).
[01:15.28]He said: "While I believe that these vaccine mandates
[01:20.80]had a tremendous beneficial impact,
[01:24.24]we are now at a point where we think that it makes a lot of sense
[01:29.36]to pull these requirements down."
[01:32.92]Biden used presidential powers to require vaccinations
[01:38.72]starting in the fall of 2021
[01:42.44]as the nation's vaccination rate leveled off.
[01:46.36]At that time, different virus versions,
[01:50.72]called variants, began to be reported.
[01:54.76]Some of the variants spread easily.
[01:58.64]Politicians debated the vaccine requirements
[02:03.04]and legal action was brought
[02:05.36]against them in courts around the country.
[02:09.04]At one time, more than 100 million people were covered
[02:14.76]by the U.S. vaccine mandates.
[02:17.96]Biden had ruled out such requirements
[02:21.48]before taking office in January 2021.
[02:26.00]But he became more open to the idea when much of the public
[02:31.56]refused to get vaccinated.
[02:34.32]His administration argued that people who did not get vaccinated
[02:39.96]were endangering the lives of others
[02:43.04]and harming the nation's economic recovery.
[02:46.84]Federal courts and the U.S. Congress
[02:50.40]have already withdrawn Biden's vaccine requirements
[02:54.88]for large employers and military service members.
[02:59.04]More than 1.13 million people in the U.S.
[03:04.12]have died of COVID-19
