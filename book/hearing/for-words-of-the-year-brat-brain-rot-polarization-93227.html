<p>From “brat” to “brain rot” and “polarization,” word experts agree that social media and politics have driven conversations that use these terms. Here are their <strong>selections</strong> for word of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Polarization</strong></p>
<p>The American dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster selected <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year">polarization</a> as its word of the year for 2024. The dictionary publisher defines <u>polarization</u> as “division into two sharply <strong>distinct</strong> opposites; especially, a state in which the opinions, beliefs, or interests of a group or society...become concentrated at opposing extremes.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This cover image released by Atlantic Records shows " ap="" brat="" by="" charli="" records="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/96a5ce05-f6b6-4cfe-81f7-76c6a8e8dbae_cx0_cy23_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" via="" xcx.=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This cover image released by Atlantic Records shows "brat" by Charli XCX. (Atlantic Records via AP)</span></div>
<p>As divided as Americans appear, Merriam-Webster says <u>polarization</u> “happens to be one idea that both sides of the political <strong>spectrum</strong> agree on.”</p>
<p>The word was widely used in news stories and broadcasts to describe the presidential election in the United States. Supporters of both candidates, president-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, voiced the opinion that the opposing candidate was a threat to the nation.</p>
<p>The U.S. election also brought attention to two other words: <u>pander</u> and <u>weird</u>. Trump's supporters accused Harris of <u>pandering</u>, in other words, changing her policy positions to get votes. And Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz called his opponents <u>weird</u>, meaning strange or unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Brain rot</strong></p>
<p>The editors at Britain's Oxford University Press say usage of its word of the year selection, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024/">brain rot</a><u>,</u> increased by 230 percent from 2023 to 2024.</p>
<p>Oxford defines brain rot as “the supposed <strong>deterioration</strong> of a person's mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.”</p>
<p>The phrase likely first appeared in written form in Henry David Thoreau's 1854 book <em>Walden</em> about his experiences living a simple lifestyle. He wrote: “While England <strong>endeavors</strong> to cure the potato rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot – which prevails so much more widely and fatally?”</p>
<p>In 2024, the phrase has been used to describe concerns about the harm of overconsuming, or watching and reading too much, online material.</p>
<p>Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, noted, “I find it fascinating that the term ‘brain rot' has been adopted by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, those communities largely responsible for the use and creation of the digital content the term refers to.”</p>
<p><strong>Brat</strong></p>
<p>Politics and social media come together in the Collins Dictionary's selection of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blog.collinsdictionary.com/language-lovers/a-year-when-hedonism-and-anxiety-combine/">brat</a> as its word of the year.</p>
<p>The most recent usage of <u>brat</u> started as the title of an album by pop singer Charli XCX. Then it went <strong>viral</strong> as a campaign <strong>slogan</strong> “Kamala IS <u>Brat</u>” for the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
<p>The word means different things to different people.</p>
<p>Traditionally, <u>brat</u> describes an immature person or an unruly child. But Collins says it is now used to describe a person with “confident, independent, and <strong>hedonistic attitude</strong>.”</p>
<p>Collins says the term <u>brat</u> “has clearly captured something of the spirit of the age.” And for a short time, the word <u>brat summer</u> even “established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life.”</p>
<p><strong>Demure</strong></p>
<p>The online Dictionary.com selected <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-year-2024/">demure</a> as its word of the year for 2024. Between January and the end of August, Dictionary.com<em> </em>said the word “saw a nearly 1200 percent increase in usage in digital web media alone.”</p>
<p>The sharp rise is credited to several videos on TikTok by Jools Lebron. “You see how I do my makeup for work?” she asked. “Very <u>demure</u>, very mindful.”</p>
<p><u>Demure</u> is another example of how popular word usage changes over time. In the 14th century, <u>demure</u> was used to describe people who avoid bringing attention to themselves. Today, the word is used to describe someone who brings attention to themselves with “refined and <strong>sophisticated</strong> appearance or behavior.”</p>
<p>And those are the Words of the Year for 2024.</p>

。
[00:00.04]From "brat" to "brain rot"
[00:03.28]and "polarization,"
[00:05.24]word experts agree
[00:07.80]that social media and politics
[00:10.72]have driven conversations
[00:12.92]that use these terms.
[00:15.96]Here are their selections
[00:17.92]for word of the year.
[00:21.04]The American dictionary publisher
[00:23.92]Merriam-Webster selected polarization
[00:27.96]as its word of the year for 2024.
[00:32.16]The dictionary publisher defines polarization
[00:36.68]as "division into two sharply distinct opposites;
[00:41.92]especially, a state in which the opinions,
[00:45.92]beliefs, or interests of a group or society
[00:50.32]...become concentrated at opposing extremes."
[00:56.52]As divided as Americans appear,
[00:59.60]Merriam-Webster says polarization
[01:03.56]"happens to be one idea
[01:06.20]that both sides of the political spectrum agree on."
[01:12.20]The word was widely used
[01:14.76]in news stories and broadcasts
[01:17.36]to describe the presidential election
[01:20.60]in the United States.
[01:22.96]Supporters of both candidates,
[01:25.72]president-elect Donald Trump
[01:27.96]and Vice President Kamala Harris,
[01:31.20]voiced the opinion that the opposing candidate
[01:35.32]was a threat to the nation.
[01:38.60]The U.S. election also brought attention
[01:42.16]to two other words: pander and weird.
[01:47.88]Trump's supporters accused Harris of pandering,
[01:52.36]in other words, changing her policy positions
[01:56.76]to get votes.
[01:59.28]And Democratic vice-presidential candidate
[02:02.80]Tim Walz called his opponents weird,
[02:07.32]meaning strange or unusual.
[02:11.72]The editors at Britain's Oxford University Press say
[02:16.88]usage of its word of the year selection, brain rot,
[02:22.12]increased by 230 percent from 2023 to 2024.
[02:30.80]Oxford defines brain rot
[02:33.68]as "the supposed deterioration
[02:37.16]of a person's mental or intellectual state,
[02:41.12]especially viewed as the result of
[02:44.36]overconsumption of material
[02:46.96](now particularly online content)
[02:50.80]considered to be trivial or unchallenging."
[02:56.72]The phrase likely first appeared in written form
[03:01.24]in Henry David Thoreau's 1854 book Walden
[03:06.72]about his experiences living a simple lifestyle.
[03:12.16]He wrote: "While England endeavors
[03:15.60]to cure the potato rot,
[03:18.00]will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot
[03:22.12]– which prevails so much more widely and fatally?"
[03:28.16]In 2024, the phrase has been used
[03:31.88]to describe concerns
[03:33.88]about the harm of overconsuming,
[03:37.12]or watching and reading too much, online material.
[03:42.00]Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, noted,
[03:47.44]"I find it fascinating that the term ‘brain rot'
[03:51.44]has been adopted by Gen Z and Gen Alpha,
[03:56.04]those communities largely responsible
[03:59.72]for the use and creation
[04:02.00]of the digital content the term refers to."
[04:07.20]Politics and social media come together
[04:10.84]in the Collins Dictionary's selection of brat
[04:14.96]as its word of the year.
[04:18.36]The most recent usage of brat
[04:21.08]started as the title of an album
[04:24.36]by pop singer Charli XCX.
[04:28.16]Then it went viral as a campaign slogan
[04:32.96]"Kamala IS Brat"
[04:36.00]for the Democratic presidential candidate.
[04:39.96]The word means different things to different people.
[04:44.08]Traditionally, brat describes an immature person
[04:49.04]or an unruly child.
[04:51.44]But Collins says
[04:53.80]it is now used to describe a person
[04:57.00]with "confident, independent,
[04:59.96]and hedonistic attitude."
[05:04.36]Collins says the term brat
[05:07.12]"has clearly captured something
[05:09.72]of the spirit of the age."
[05:12.36]And for a short time, the word brat summer
[05:16.88]even "established itself
[05:19.28]as an aesthetic and a way of life."
[05:24.68]The online Dictionary.com selected demure
[05:30.44]as its word of the year for 2024.
[05:35.72]Between January and the end of August,
[05:39.12]Dictionary.com said
[05:41.72]the word "saw a nearly
[05:44.48]1200 percent increase in usage
[05:48.80]in digital web media alone."
[05:53.12]The sharp rise is credited
[05:55.76]to several videos on TikTok by Jools Lebron.
[06:02.44]"You see how I do my makeup for work?" she asked.
[06:06.80]"Very demure, very mindful."
[06:11.60]Demure is another example
[06:14.20]of how popular word usage changes over time.
[06:19.60]In the 14th century,
[06:22.32]demure was used to describe people
[06:25.76]who avoid bringing attention to themselves.
[06:29.44]Today, the word is used to describe someone
[06:33.92]who brings attention to themselves
[06:36.88]with "refined and
[06:39.48]sophisticated appearance or behavior."
[06:44.32]And those are the Words of the Year for 2024.
