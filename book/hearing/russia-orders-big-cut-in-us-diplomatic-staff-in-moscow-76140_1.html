<p>Peskov said the reduction of diplomatic staff ordered by Putin could include Russia citizens. But it is still likely to require big reductions in U.S. personnel at the U.S. embassy in Moscow.<br/>佩斯科夫表示，普京下令削减的美国外交人员可能也包括俄罗斯公民，但是这可能仍然需要美国驻莫斯科大使馆的美方人员作出大幅削减。</p>
<p>Putin made his announcement in a Russian television interview on Sunday. He acted after U.S. officials said President Donald Trump would sign into law legislation that places additional sanctions on Russia, and two other countries: Iran and North Korea.<br/>普京周日在接受俄罗斯电视台采访时宣布了这一决定。他是在美国官员声称川普将会签署国会对俄罗斯以及伊朗和朝鲜两国进行额外制裁的法案之后采取了这一行动。</p>
<p>The bill was approved by large majorities in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.<br/>该法案在美国参众两院议员中以绝大优势获得通过。</p>
<p>Putin said on Russian state television Sunday, "We had hoped that the situation will somehow change, but apparently if it changes, it won't be soon. I thought it was the time to show that we're not going to leave it without an answer."<br/>普京周日在俄罗斯电视台上表示：“我们原本希望形势会有所好转，但是看来即使形势转变，也不会是在近期。我认为现在是时候表明我们不会对此置之不理。”</p>

Obama had ordered reductions in Russian diplomatic staff to punish Russia for interfering with the 2016 U.S. elections.<br/>俄罗斯专家表示，普京曾希望同川普政府的关系会强于同美国前总统奥巴马的关系。奥巴马曾下令削减俄罗斯外交人员，以惩罚俄罗斯干涉美国2016年大选。</p>

He served as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012-2014 during the Obama administration.<br/>麦克福尔在推特上表示：“如果真的削减这么多美方外交人员，俄罗斯人应该预料到需要等待数周甚至数月才能获得赴美签证。”他在奥巴马执政期间，担任了2012年-2014年的美国驻俄罗斯大使。</p>

[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.20]Russia has called on the United States to show "political will"
[00:07.64]to improve relations between the two countries.
[00:12.96]The comment comes one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin
[00:20.00]ordered large cuts in the number of people working at the U.S. Embassy.
[00:27.92]Putin ordered the United States to reduce its diplomatic workers in Russia by 755.
[00:38.80]Dmitry Peskov is a Russian government spokesman.
[00:43.52]He said Monday, "We are interested in a steady development of our ties
[00:50.72]and are sorry to note that we are still far from that."
[00:57.12]Peskov said the reduction of diplomatic staff
[01:01.40]ordered by Putin could include Russia citizens.
[01:06.64]But it is still likely to require big reductions
[01:11.16]in U.S. personnel at the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
[01:17.20]Putin made his announcement in a Russian television interview on Sunday.
[01:23.68]He acted after U.S. officials said President Donald Trump
[01:29.70]would sign into law legislation that places additional sanctions on Russia,
[01:36.84]and two other countries: Iran and North Korea.
[01:42.52]The bill was approved by large majorities
[01:46.27]in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
[01:51.28]Putin said on Russian state television Sunday,
[01:55.28]"We had hoped that the situation will somehow change,
[02:00.60]but apparently if it changes, it won't be soon.
[02:06.04]I thought it was the time to show that we're
[02:10.08]not going to leave it without an answer."
[02:14.64]Putin said that Russia is open to working with the U.S.
[02:19.60]on issues such as terrorism and cybercrime.
[02:24.60]But he said it "only hears" false charges of Russian interference.
[02:31.96]Russian experts said Putin had hoped for better relations with the Trump administration
[02:39.28]than he had with former President Barack Obama.
[02:44.52]Obama had ordered reductions in Russian diplomatic staff
[02:49.72]to punish Russia for interfering with the 2016 U.S. elections.
[02:57.16]Congressional and FBI investigations into possible connections
[03:02.76]between Trump's campaign and Russia have made it more difficult
[03:08.67]for Trump to move for improved relations.
[03:13.56]Michael O'Hanlon is a foreign policy expert for the Brookings Institution,
[03:20.16]a Washington think tank.
[03:22.76]He said, "President Trump himself is already using far tougher words
[03:29.60]toward Russia than he did as a [presidential] candidate.
[03:34.04]O'Hanlon also said Trump's top security experts are taking a hard line against Russia.
[03:43.36]Former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, said the new Russian sanctions
[03:50.52]will likely mean longer waits for Russians to obtain visas to travel to the United States.
[03:59.08]"If these cuts are real, Russians should expect to wait weeks
[04:04.64]if not months to get visas to come to U.S."
[04:09.44]McFaul said on Twitter. He served as U.S. ambassador to Russia
[04:14.61]from 2012-2014 during the Obama administration.
[04:21.76]The sanctions bill passed by Congress places additional economic limits on Russian industries.
[04:30.68]Russia's economy has already felt the effects from sanctions put in place in 2014.
[04:39.44]Those restrictions were meant to punish Russia for its annexation
[04:45.00]of Crimea from Ukraine that same year.
[04:49.64]In early July, Putin and Trump met twice
[04:54.21]during a meeting of the Group of 20 leaders in Germany.
[04:59.48]During their first meeting, Trump said Putin denied
[05:04.44]he directed efforts to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.
[05:10.96]U.S. Vice President Mike Pence spoke in Eastern Europe Monday
[05:16.79]after the embassy staff reductions were announced by Putin.
[05:22.40]Pence said there is no bigger threat to Baltic States than Russia.
[05:29.44]He said Russia continues to try to change international borders by force,
[05:36.80]"undermine democracies" and "divide the free nations of Europe,
[05:42.80]one against another."
[05:45.36]Pence spoke in Estonia's capital, Tallinn,
[05:49.56]after meeting with leaders of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
