<div class="content">For almost six years, Andrea Haberman's burned wallet lay mostly untouched at her parents' home in the American state of Wisconsin. It was placed alongside some of her other personal belongings – her burned cellphone, eyeglasses and house keys.<br/>
近6年来，安德莉亚·哈伯曼被烧毁的钱包大部分时间都放在她威斯康辛州的父母家里没有动过。它跟她的其它一些个人物品放在一些，包括她被烧毁的手机、眼镜和房子钥匙。
<p>Those few objects were all that remained of a young life that ended when a hijacked airplane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Haberman was 25 years old and about to be married. She was on a business trip from Chicago. It was her first visit to New York City.<br/>
2001年9月11日，一架被劫持的飞机撞上了世贸中心北塔，一段年轻的生命就此终结。哈伯曼当时25岁，即将结婚。她从芝加哥去出差。这是她第一次去纽约市。</p>
<p>For Haberman's family, the belongings she had with her that day are a reminder of their great sadness.<br/>
对于哈伯曼的家人来说，这些她当天随身携带的物品提醒着他们的巨大悲痛。</p>
<p>"These are not the happy things you want to remember someone by," said her father, Gordon Haberman.<br/>
她的父亲戈登·哈伯曼表示：“这些不是你想要借以记住某人的幸福物品。”</p>
<p>To ease their pain, the family gave the items to the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum. The thousands of personal artifacts tell the story of the lives lost on that day.<br/>
为了减轻他们的痛苦，这家人将这些物品交给了911纪念博物馆。数以千计的个人物品讲述了那天逝去的生命的故事。</p>
<p>Some are shown at the 9/11 museum. Others are shown at other museums around the country.<br/>
有些物品在911博物馆展出。还有些物品则在全国其它博物馆展出。</p>
<p>"Each person who makes up part of that tally was an individual who lived a life," said Jan Ramirez. She is the museum's chief curator and director of collections.<br/>
简·拉米雷斯表示：“构成该记录的每个人都是一条活生生的生命。”她是该博物馆的首席策展人和藏品总监。</p>
<p>"We knew that families — the people that have lost a loved one that day — were going to need to have a place, have a way, to remember the person that never came home from work, that never came home from a flight," Ramirez added.<br/>
拉米雷斯还说：“我们知道有家庭在那天失去了最爱的人，他们需要有一个地方，有一种方式来纪念那些下班再也无法回家的人，那些乘机再也无法抵达的人。”</p>
<p>Many of those personal items were found in the ruins of what was once the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center. Other items were donated by survivors or by the families of those who died.<br/>
其中许多个人物品都是在曾经的世贸中心双子塔的废墟中发现的。其它物品则是由幸存者或遇难者家属捐赠。</p>
<p>A collection of woodworking tools represents Sean Rooney, a vice president at Aon Corp. He died in the South Tower. Woodworking was his hobby.<br/>
一组木工工具代表了肖恩·鲁尼，他是怡安保险集团的副总裁。他在南塔遇难。木工是他的爱好。</p>
<p>Rooney called his wife, Beverly Eckert, at their home in Stamford, Connecticut, after being trapped by fire and smoke on the 105th floor. He spent his last minutes alive talking about their life together. He said "I love you" to his wife as he fought to breathe.<br/>
鲁尼被烟火困在105楼后，给康涅狄格州斯坦福德家中的妻子贝弗利·埃克特打去了电话。他生命的最后一秒都在谈论他们在一起的生活。他拼尽最后一口气对妻子说“我爱你。”</p>
<p>His body was never found.<br/>
他的遗体没有被找到。</p>
<p>Beverly died eight years later in a plane crash while traveling to Buffalo, New York, to award a scholarship in the name of her husband. Before she died, she had set aside the woodworking tools.<br/>
贝弗利8年后前往纽约布法罗颁发以他丈夫命名的奖学金时因飞机失事遇难。临死前，她将这套木工工具放在一旁。</p>
<p>Robert Chin's hobby was softball, a sport he loved. He played for his employer Fiduciary Trust International. After his first hit, his coworkers all signed the ball and gave it to him. Many of those coworkers also died on 9/11. Chin's family gave the ball to the museum.<br/>
罗伯特·勤的爱好是垒球，他热爱这项运动。他为他的雇主Fiduciary Trust International效力。在他第一次击球之后，他的同事都在这个球上签名，然后把它送给他。其中许多同事也在911事件中丧生。勤的家人将这个秋交给了博物馆。</p>
<p>Not all artifacts included in the collection represent someone who died. Some are from those who survived the terrorist attacks.<br/>
并非所有藏品都代表遇难者。有些藏品来自那些在这场恐怖袭击中幸存下来的人。</p>
<p>Linda Raisch-Lopez gave the museum the blood-covered shoes she was wearing that day. She walked down from the 97th floor without shoes to move more quickly, cutting her feet. She later put the shoes back on to run away from the area.<br/>
琳达·雷施-洛佩兹将她那天穿的沾满血迹的鞋子送给了博物馆。为了走得更快，她从97楼光着脚走了下来，脚划破了。她后来重新穿上鞋子逃离了该地区。</p>
<p>Only a small part of the museum's collection of artifacts can be shown at one time; there are simply too many objects. When they are not on display, the artifacts are stored in buildings in New York and New Jersey.<br/>
每次都只能展示博物馆的一小部分藏品，因为东西太多了。当这些物品没有展出时，它们被存放在纽约和新泽西的大楼里。</p>
<p>Ramirez called the artifacts "palpable pieces of truth." She added that the collection brings purpose to what she does and will continue to do.<br/>
拉米雷斯表示，这些物品是显而易见的真相。她还表示，这些藏品给她的行为带来了重大意义，她将继续做下去。</p>

[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:00.04]For almost six years, Andrea Haberman's burned wallet
[00:05.84]lay mostly untouched at her parents' home
[00:10.44]in the American state of Wisconsin.
[00:15.04]It was placed alongside some of her other personal belongings
[00:20.20]– her burned cellphone, eyeglasses and house keys.
[00:25.40]Those few objects were all that remained of a young life
[00:30.60]that ended when a hijacked airplane struck the North Tower
[00:35.36]of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.
[00:41.32]Haberman was 25 years old and about to be married.
[00:46.60]She was on a business trip from Chicago.
[00:50.96]It was her first visit to New York City.
[00:55.32]For Haberman's family, the belongings she had with her that day
[01:00.32]are a reminder of their great sadness.
[01:04.76]"These are not the happy things you want to remember someone by,"
[01:09.24]said her father, Gordon Haberman.
[01:13.12]To ease their pain, the family gave the items
[01:17.28]to the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum.
[01:21.52]The thousands of personal artifacts
[01:24.40]tell the story of the lives lost on that day.
[01:30.20]Some are shown at the 9/11 museum.
[01:34.20]Others are shown at other museums around the country.
[01:40.32]"Each person who makes up part of that tally
[01:43.80]was an individual who lived a life," said Jan Ramirez.
[01:49.28]She is the museum's chief curator and director of collections.
[01:55.76]"We knew that families — the people
[01:58.56]that have lost a loved one that day
[02:01.64]— were going to need to have a place, have a way,
[02:05.08]to remember the person that never came home from work,
[02:08.80]that never came home from a flight," Ramirez added.
[02:14.32]Many of those personal items were found in the ruins
[02:18.16]of what was once the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center.
[02:22.88]Other items were donated by survivors
[02:27.28]or by the families of those who died.
[02:31.40]A collection of woodworking tools represents Sean Rooney,
[02:36.32]a vice president at Aon Corp.
[02:39.80]He died in the South Tower.
[02:43.04]Woodworking was his hobby.
[02:46.88]Rooney called his wife, Beverly Eckert,
[02:49.76]at their home in Stamford, Connecticut,
[02:52.64]after being trapped by fire and smoke on the 105th floor.
[02:59.60]He spent his last minutes alive
[03:02.48]talking about their life together.
[03:05.28]He said "I love you" to his wife as he fought to breathe.
[03:11.28]His body was never found.
[03:14.76]Beverly died eight years later in a plane crash
[03:18.60]while traveling to Buffalo, New York,
[03:21.32]to award a scholarship in the name of her husband.
[03:26.48]Before she died, she had set aside the woodworking tools.
[03:31.64]Robert Chin's hobby was softball, a sport he loved.
[03:36.28]He played for his employer Fiduciary Trust International.
[03:42.92]After his first hit, his coworkers
[03:46.12]all signed the ball and gave it to him.
[03:50.16]Many of those coworkers also died on 9/11.
[03:54.64]Chin's family gave the ball to the museum.
[03:59.48]Not all artifacts included in the collection represent someone who died.
[04:05.96]Some are from those who survived the terrorist attacks.
[04:11.00]Linda Raisch-Lopez gave the museum
[04:14.16]the blood-covered shoes she was wearing that day.
[04:18.16]She walked down from the 97th floor
[04:21.88]without shoes to move more quickly, cutting her feet.
[04:26.76]She later put the shoes back on to run away from the area.
[04:33.08]Only a small part of the museum's collection of artifacts
[04:37.20]can be shown at one time;
[04:39.88]there are simply too many objects.
[04:43.72]When they are not on display,
[04:46.36]the artifacts are stored in buildings in New York and New Jersey.
[04:52.72]Ramirez called the artifacts "palpable pieces of truth."
[04:58.60]She added that the collection brings purpose
[05:01.64]to what she does and will continue to do.
