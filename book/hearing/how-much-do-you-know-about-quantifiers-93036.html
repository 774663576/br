<p>For VOA Learning English, this is <em>Everyday Grammar</em>.</p>
<p>Today we are going to talk about different ways of expressing quantity in English.</p>
<p>A <strong>quantifier </strong>is a word or number that shows an amount or number. You probably already know how to use common quantifiers like <em>much</em> and<em> many</em>. For example:</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/80470000-c0a8-0242-8421-08daad1f2a99_cx2_cy0_cw97_w100_r1.png"/></div>
<p><em>How many apples would you like?</em></p>
<p><em>How much fruit would you like?</em></p>
<p>The quantifier<em> many</em> is used before <em>apples</em>, which is a <strong>count noun</strong>. <em>Much</em> is used before <em>fruit</em>, a <strong>noncount noun</strong>.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the difference between <strong>count nouns </strong>and <strong>noncount nouns </strong>before you study quantifiers. You can learn about count and noncount nouns in <a class="wsw__a" href="/preview/en-US-LEARN/a/3193621.html">last week's episode of Everyday Grammar</a>.</p>
<p>Quantifiers are adjectives and adjective phrases that go before nouns. They give information about <em>how much</em> or <em>how many</em> of an item you are talking about. Some quantifiers, like <em>many,</em> go only before count nouns. Others, like <em>much,</em> go only before noncount nouns. And a few quantifiers can go before count or noncount nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Quantifiers only used with count nouns</strong></p>
<p><em>One, each </em>and<em> every</em> are examples of count noun quantifiers.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>One movie that I enjoy is “The Godfather.”</em></p>
<p><em>Each child is special.</em></p>
<p><em>Every member of the country club is rich.</em></p>
<p>With plural count nouns, just add <em>of the</em> between the quantifier and the noun it describes.</p>
<p><em>One of the boys is from China.</em></p>
<p><em>Each of the cars has air conditioning.</em></p>
<p><em>Every one of the students is smart.</em></p>
<p>Notice that <em>boys, cars</em> and<em> students</em> are plural nouns. But the verbs that follow them are singular. In most situations, <em>one, each and every</em> make the subject singular, even if the subject contains a plural noun.</p>
<p>This tricky rule confuses native speakers and English learners alike.</p>
<p>There are a few quantifiers related to the number <em>two</em>. You can say <em>I have two shoes</em>, <em>I have a couple of shoes, I have both shoes, </em>and<em> I have a pair of shoes</em>.</p>
<p>If you have more than two countable items, you can use <em>several, a few, many </em>and<em> a number of</em>.</p>
<p><em>I have several <strong>assignments</strong> due this week.</em></p>
<p><em>There are a few Thai restaurants in my town.</em></p>
<p><em>There are many ways to practice English.</em></p>
<p><em>A number of the cars are imported.</em></p>
<p><strong>Quantifiers only used with noncount nouns</strong></p>
<p>Now let's move on to quantifiers that only work with noncount nouns: <em>a little, much </em>and<em> a great deal of</em>. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>Could you loan me a little money?</em></p>
<p><em>The old woman has much wisdom to share.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a great deal of oil in Saudi Arabia.</em></p>
<p><em>Little</em> can go before a count noun if it is used as an adjective. For example, “The little boy is playing.” In this example,<em> little</em> does not refer to a number or quantity; it refers to the size of the boy.</p>
<p><strong>Quantifiers used with both count and noncount nouns</strong></p>
<p>There are several “safe” quantifiers that can go with both count and noncount nouns. <em>Some</em> is the most popular. <em>Most, plenty of, all </em>and <em>any </em>are other <strong>options</strong>. Listen for the quantifiers in these examples:</p>
<p><em>He cut some wood. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>Most Americans speak English. (count noun)</em></p>
<p><em>I have plenty of money. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>All children are special. (count noun)</em></p>
<p><em>Do you have any coffee? (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p>To refer to the<strong> absence </strong>or <strong>lack of</strong> something, simply use <em>no</em> before a count or noncount noun.</p>
<p><em>There was no rice left. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>There were no books in the library. (count noun)</em></p>
<p><em>She had no love for her ex-husband. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>No, when used as a quantifier, has the same meaning as zero.</em></p>
<p><em>Lots </em>and<em> a lot of</em> are very popular quantifiers — maybe too popular. Some English teachers do not like them. They think that <em>lots </em>and<em> a lot of</em> are overused and <strong>unsophisticated</strong>. You should avoid <em>lots </em>and<em> a lot of</em> in formal writing. Native speakers usually shorten <em>a lot of </em>to<em> “</em>a lotta” in casual speech.</p>
<p><strong>Few/a few vs. little/a little</strong></p>
<p>Listen carefully to these two sentences:</p>
<p><em>I have a few friends.</em></p>
<p><em>I have few friends</em>.</p>
<p>What is the difference? The first sentence contains the article <em>a</em>. This little word makes a big difference in meaning.</p>
<p><em>I have a few friends</em> <strong>focuses</strong> on a positive idea. The speaker is satisfied with the number of friends he has. The second sentence, <em>I have few friends</em>, focuses on a <strong>negative</strong> idea, his lack of friends. The speaker wishes he had more friends.</p>
<p>It might help to think of<em> few</em> as a half-empty glass of water. <em>A few</em> is like a half-filled glass of water. The amount of water is the same. But the speaker's attitude about the amount of water is different. <em>Few </em>and<em> a few</em> are only used before count nouns.</p>
<p>The same <strong>positive</strong>-negative <strong>distinction </strong>applies to <em>a little </em>and<em> little</em>. Use <em>little</em> and<em> a little</em> before noncount nouns.</p>
<p><em>I have a little money means the speaker has some money.</em></p>
<p><em>I have little money means the speaker does not have enough money.</em></p>
<p>Speaking of <em>little</em>, we have <em>little</em> time left for today's program. We hope you learned a few tips about how to use quantifiers.</p>
