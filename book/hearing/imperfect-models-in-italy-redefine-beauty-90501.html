。
[00:00.04]An Italian project on the social media service Instagram
[00:04.80]is aiming to bring attention to women
[00:08.04]who do not look like usual fashion models.
[00:12.88]Carlotta Giancane started L'Imperfetta modeling agency in 2020.
[00:20.40]The name means "imperfect" in the Italian language.
[00:25.40]And the agency aims to redefine ideas about beauty in Italy.
[00:33.44]The agency works with models
[00:35.72]who are unusual for the industry in many ways.
[00:40.68]The models are of all sizes and ages.
[00:45.00]Some of the models have disabilities.
[00:49.04]Others have medical conditions — like alopecia,
[00:53.00]which causes hair loss.
[00:56.04]Still others have scars where they have been injured
[00:59.56]or have skin discolorations.
[01:04.68]Sonia Spartá is one of the models.
[01:08.12]The 28-year-old from Sicily has a condition called
[01:13.16]hyperpigmentation or unusual skin coloring.
[01:19.04]It results in dark spots on her face and body.
[01:24.88]She said that she often hears people talk in public
[01:28.84]about her appearance.
[01:31.80]She has heard some parents tell their children
[01:34.92]that she is from the circus.
[01:38.60]Before, she tried to hide her condition.
[01:42.12]Now, she does not.
[01:44.40]She considers her appearance beautiful.
[01:49.28]She said, "I changed things so that my weakness,
[01:53.68]or how I perceived a weakness,
[01:56.48]became my source of strength -- my distinctiveness."
[02:03.36]This is the first such agency in Italy.
[02:08.40]Giancane, the founder of the company, said:
[02:12.16]"I feel like a revolutionary
[02:14.64]because I realize that around me
[02:18.48]all this did not exist before L'Imperfetta."
[02:24.16]The agency has more than 140 models.
[02:28.76]They are in Italy and around the world.
[02:33.08]However, Giancane said she wants to change things in Italy.
[02:39.60]Her models have appeared in advertising campaigns
[02:43.32]for cosmetic products, fashion retailers, and supermarkets.
[02:50.48]Much of the work is in online advertisements.
[02:54.64]But there have also been calls
[02:57.48]for models in television advertisements.
[03:01.48]Two models have appeared in fashion shows
[03:04.80]in Milan for designer Marco Rambaldi.
[03:10.20]Model Lucia Della Ratta is a university student in Rome.
[03:15.88]She hid her albinism for most of her life.
[03:20.20]She tried to darken the color of her hair and skin with products.
[03:26.64]But during the pandemic lockdown,
[03:29.52]she let her natural hair color grow out
[03:32.80]and began posting photos on Instagram.
[03:37.72]"I felt beautiful for the first time," Della Ratta said recently.
[03:43.32]The change still brings tears to her eyes.
[03:46.60]"I felt it was my essence, as though it is me, as I really am."
[03:55.16]Another model, Desireé D'Angelo,
[03:58.28]has had alopecia since she was 10 years old.
[04:03.28]At school she wore a hat to hide her baldness.
[04:07.32]But classmates would often take it off her head.
[04:11.84]At age 15, a dance teacher suggested
[04:15.76]that she accept her condition and stop hiding it.
[04:20.76]Since then, she has become a successful dancer,
[04:24.80]performer, and model.
[04:28.44]"I like my body. I like my peculiarity.
[04:32.64]In the end, I have accepted it," she said.
