[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:01.20]Three scientists have won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics
[00:07.04]for their work in measuring gravitational waves.
[00:12.00]The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the prize winners on Tuesday.
[00:18.72]The scientists are Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
[00:24.60]and Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, both of whom work at the California Institute of Technology.
[00:33.44]The three men were involved in the first actual observation of gravitational waves in September 2015.
[00:41.83]They are being recognized for a combination of highly developed scientific theory and equipment design.
[00:51.32]The German-born Weiss was awarded half of the $1.1 million in prize money.
[00:59.40]Thorne and Barish will split the other half.
[01:03.28]The physics prize has been split among two or more winners for the past 25 years.
[01:10.88]About a hundred years ago, Albert Einstein proposed his General Theory of Relativity.
[01:18.60]It predicted the existence of gravitational waves anytime an object accelerates, or speeds up.
[01:27.24]His theory changed the way scientists understand the universe.
[01:32.40]But only recently were the waves seen, proving Einstein was correct.
[01:39.68]Barish told the Associated Press that the Nobel prize is "a win for Einstein, and a very big one."
[01:49.32]Weiss, Barish and Thorne were leaders in the experiments performed
[01:54.68]at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO.
[02:00.80]They measured very small disturbances the waves make to space and time as they pass through the Earth.
[02:10.48]LIGO measured gravitational waves for the first time about two years ago.
[02:16.88]Those waves were produced when two "black holes" came together
[02:21.76]and formed a single, huge black hole.
[02:26.04]The two black holes were about 1.3 billion light-years from Earth.
[02:32.56]A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year: about 9.46 trillion kilometers.
[02:42.88]When the discovery of gravitational waves was announced several months later,
[02:49.40]scientists and other people were astonished.
[02:54.40]Weiss said of the physics prize: "I view this more as a thing
[02:59.76]that recognizes the work of a thousand people."
[03:04.20]Weiss has been attempting to detect gravitational waves for many years.
[03:09.84]He designed a laser-based device in the 1970s to do so.
[03:15.96]The Nobel announcement said that Weiss, Thorne and Barish
[03:21.44]"ensured that four decades of effort led to gravitational waves finally being observed."
[03:28.88]It noted that Einstein believed gravitational waves could never be measured.
[03:35.48]Thorne told the Associated Press from California shortly after the announcement
[03:40.96]that "it's a win for the human race as a whole.
[03:45.68]These gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe."
[03:53.68]Ariel Goobar is with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
[03:59.12]He said the winners' work meant "we can study processes which were completely impossible,
[04:06.00]out of reach to us in the past. The best comparison is when Galileo discovered the telescope,
[04:14.28]which allowed us to see that Jupiter had moons and all of a sudden
[04:19.36]we discovered that the universe was much vaster than we used to think about," he added.
[04:25.12]Patrick Sutton is an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales.
[04:31.20]He told the AP that with the technology the scientists developed
[04:36.44]"we may even see entirely new objects that we haven't even imagined yet."
