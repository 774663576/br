<p>Cadaveric spasm is a poorly understood condition. It is thought to happen after severe physical or emotional suffering. The <strong>contracted</strong> facial muscles become tense and unmoving immediately following death.</p>

。
[00:00.04]Scientists now have an explanation
[00:04.12]for the mysterious remains
[00:06.28]of an ancient Egyptian woman
[00:08.84]who has her mouth open
[00:10.76]in what appears to be a scream.
[00:13.88]Scientists used a special computer aided X-ray,
[00:19.28]or CT scan, of the woman's body.
[00:23.40]What they found suggested
[00:25.60]that the so-called "Screaming Woman" mummy
[00:29.16]may have died in pain
[00:31.32]and experienced a form of muscular hardening
[00:35.60]known as a cadaveric spasm.
[00:38.76]This rare kind of spasm
[00:41.16]happens at the moment of death.
[00:44.12]The examination found that the woman
[00:47.52]was about 48 years old when she died.
[00:51.68]Cairo University's Sahar Saleem
[00:55.48]said she had lived with mild arthritis of the spine
[00:59.96]and had lost some teeth.
[01:02.80]Saleem led the study that appeared recently
[01:06.64]in the publication Frontiers in Medicine.
[01:10.60]The woman's body was well-preserved
[01:13.76]although it had been embalmed 3,500 years ago.
[01:19.72]Embalmers used costly imported materials
[01:23.76]such as juniper oil
[01:25.88]and frankincense resin, Saleem added.
[01:29.28]The ancient Egyptians considered
[01:32.28]preservation of the body after death
[01:35.24]important for securing a good existence
[01:38.92]in the afterlife.
[01:40.76]It was a custom to remove the internal organs
[01:45.40]during the mummification process.
[01:48.24]But the organ removals
[01:50.60]had not taken place with this woman.
[01:53.44]Saleem said, "In ancient Egypt,
[01:56.64]the embalmers took care of the dead body,
[01:59.88]so it would look beautiful for the afterlife."
[02:03.12]She explained that embalmers
[02:05.76]were interested in closing the mouth of the dead.
[02:09.44]Embalmers kept the jaw in place
[02:12.36]by tying the jaw to the head.
[02:14.92]This prevented the normal jaw drop
[02:18.32]that occurs after death.
[02:21.20]But the embalmers were likely not careless
[02:24.76]with the so-called "Screaming Woman."
[02:27.68]They used high quality materials
[02:30.80]and gave her costly jewelry
[02:33.24]and a wig, Saleem said.
[02:35.36]She added that this evidence
[02:38.24]"opened the way to other explanations
[02:41.28]of the widely opened mouth."
[02:44.52]The woman may have died screaming from pain.
[02:47.64]And the muscles of the face may have become tense
[02:51.28]to preserve this appearance "at the time of death
[02:54.92]due to cadaveric spasm," Saleem explained.
[02:59.08]She said that the full history
[03:01.88]of the woman's death is unknown,
[03:04.24]adding the cause of her facial appearance
[03:07.52]cannot be known "with certainty."
[03:10.84]Cadaveric spasm is a poorly understood condition.
[03:15.20]It is thought to happen
[03:17.12]after severe physical or emotional suffering.
[03:20.48]The contracted facial muscles
[03:23.72]become tense and unmoving
[03:26.04]immediately following death.
[03:28.40]Saleem explained that unlike
[03:31.28]the stiffening of muscles and joints
[03:34.24]that happens after death
[03:36.28]- "cadaveric spasm affects
[03:38.64]only one group of muscles, not the entire body."
[03:43.12]Asked whether the woman
[03:45.36]may have been embalmed while alive,
[03:47.84]Saleem added, "I don't believe that this is possible."
[03:52.52]Saleem was unable to find out how the woman died.
[03:57.36]The "Screaming Woman" was found
[03:59.84]in the ancient city of Thebes
[04:02.44]during a scientific search of the burial
[04:05.76]of a high-ranking official named Senmut in 1935.
[04:11.56]The mummy was inside a wooden coffin
[04:15.68]in a room beneath Senmut's family burial area.
[04:20.32]Her identity is unknown,
[04:23.08]but her costly jewelry shows her important position.
[04:27.64]"She was likely a close family member
[04:31.12]to be buried and share the family's
[04:33.56]eternal resting place," Saleem said.
