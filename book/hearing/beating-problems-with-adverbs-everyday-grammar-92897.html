For VOA Learning English, this is Everyday Grammar.</p>
<p>This week, we're going to talk about some common problems with <strong>adverbs</strong>. Basically, adverbs are words that describe verbs, <strong>adjectives</strong>, and other adverbs. For example, "I ran quickly to the store." The adverb <em>quickly</em> describes the verb <em>run</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What is an adverb?</strong></p>
<div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1da030e9-e522-43e4-ac8d-a160b9a20b57_tv_w100_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>If a word is not easy to <strong>classify</strong> as a noun, verb, or adjective, it is probably an adverb. Some of the most common words in English are adverbs, including <em>up, so, just, then, how, now, also, here,</em> and<em> more.</em></p>
<p>Adverbs usually describe verbs. They express <em>when, how, where, and why</em> an action is done. Many adverbs are easy to find because they have the <em>–ly</em> ending, such as <em>quickly, surely, </em>and<em> certainly</em>. However, many adverbs do not have the <em>–ly</em> ending.</p>
<p>Adverbs can also describe adjectives. For example, "It is really cold today." In this example,<em> really</em> is an adverb that describes the adjective <em>cold</em>.</p>
<p>Adverbs can describe other adverbs. For example, "I will probably never go back." Here, the adverb <em>probably</em> describes the adverb <em>never</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you put the adverb?</strong></p>
<p>Where do adverbs go in a sentence? Well, it depends.</p>
<p>Some adverbs can go almost anywhere in a sentence. Let us look at the adverb<em> sometimes</em>. It can go at the beginning of the sentence as in, "Sometimes, I walk to work." It can go after the subject: "I sometimes walk to work." Or it can go at the end of the sentence: "I walk to work sometimes."</p>
<p>Other adverbs can only go in the middle of a sentence. The adverb <em>probably</em> is an example. "She will <em>probably</em> leave early."</p>
<p>It is incorrect to say, "Probably she will leave early" or "She will leave early probably." Other such adverbs are <em>never, rarely, seldom,</em> and<em> always</em>. These are called <strong>mid-sentence adverbs</strong>. They usually go between the subject and the main verb. Different types of adverbs have different <a class="wsw__a" href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/adverbs-and-adverb-phrases-position">sentence positions.</a></p>
<p><strong>What's the difference between adverbs and adjectives?</strong></p>
<p>Adjectives describe nouns, while adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Take the sentence, "She is careful." The adjective<em> careful</em> is describing the noun <em>she</em>. But if you said, "She walks carefully," the adverb <em>carefully</em> is describing the verb <em>walk</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think this is hard? Hardly!</strong></p>
<p>Native speakers sometimes confuse adverbs and adjectives.</p>
<p>The words <em>hard </em>and<em> hardly</em> are especially difficult. <em>Hard</em> is both an adjective and an adverb. You can say "The bed was <em>hard</em>," using the adjective, which means it is "very firm." You can also say, "I worked <em>hard</em>," using the adverb, which means "with a lot of effort."</p>
<p><em>Hardly</em> is an adverb. A long time ago, it meant "in a hard manner," but its meaning has changed. People used to say "not hardly.” Over time, the word “not” disappeared. Since the 1500s, <em>hardly</em> has meant "almost not" or "barely." For example, "I hardly had time to finish the project." This conflicting meaning of <em>hard</em> and <em>hardly</em> has become the basis for jokes.</p>
<p>Listen to cartoon character Homer Simpson playing with the confusion between <em>hard</em> and <em>hardly</em>. In the scene, Homer's co-workers are replaced with robots.</p>
<p><em>"So you guys are my new co-workers. So working hard or hardly working? (laugh). I said, ‘Working hard or hardly working?' ‘Working hard or hardly working? WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?' IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION!"</em></p>
<p>Homer is asking the robots if they are <em>working hard</em> (working with energy) or <em>hardly working</em> (only working a little). The robots, with their exact reasoning, do not understand the <strong>word play</strong> in the question.</p>
<p>We will leave you with a song that uses the adverb <em>softly </em>in an unexpected way. Listen to the Fugees' version of the classic song "Killing Me Softly with His Song."</p>
<p><em>Strumming my pain with his fingers</em></p>
<p><em>Singing my life with his words</em></p>
<p><em>Killing me softly with his song</em></p>
<p><em>Killing me softly with his song</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm Jonathan Evans.</p>
<p>And I'm Ashley Thompson.</p>
