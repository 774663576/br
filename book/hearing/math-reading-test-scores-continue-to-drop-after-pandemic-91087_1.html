美国教育部对新冠肺炎疫情期间学校停课导致青少年失学造成的长期学习损失表示担忧。</p>
<p>The department released the scores from a national math and reading test, given to 13-year-olds, on June 21.
该部门于6月21日公布了13岁学生的全国数学和阅读测试成绩。</p>
<p>Eight thousand seven hundred students took the test in both math and reading in late 2022.<br/>
八千七百名学生参加了2022年末的数学和阅读测试。</p>
<p>The results showed a drop of nine points in math and four points in reading compared to 2020, the last year the test was administered. The department's information shows that those are the largest point decreases between tests recorded since 1973.<br/>
测试结果显示，与2020年（上次考试时间）相比，数学和阅读分别下降了9分和4分。该部门的数据显示，这是自1973年以来录得的两次测试之间的最大降幅。</p>
<p>The test asks students to read short passages and identify the main idea or some facts. In math, students need to do simple multiplication and geometry.<br/>
测试要求学生阅读短文，并确定大意或一些事实。在数学方面，学生需要做简单的乘法和几何运算。</p>
<p>Peggy G. Carr is the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the Department of Education. In a news release, she said the scores show that there are still "worrisome signs about student achievement" two years after most returned to in-person school.<br/>
佩吉·卡尔是教育部下属的国家教育统计中心的专员。她在一份新闻稿中表示，分数表明在大多数学生重返线下教育两年后，学生成绩仍有“令人担忧的迹象”。</p>
<p>Carr said she was hoping to see "green shoots of academic recovery," but did not. Green shoots is a term officials use to describe signs of improvement.<br/>
卡尔说，她希望看到“学术复苏的萌芽”，但是并没有看到。“萌芽”是有关官员用来描述改善迹象的一个术语。</p>
<p>The results of a similar test, given to younger students, came out in 2022. They also showed learning problems connected to missed class time for fourth and eighth graders.<br/>
一项针对年轻学生的类似测试的结果于2022年公布。它们也展示了与四年级和八年级学生错过上课时间有关的学习问题。</p>
<p>Education officials said test scores were falling in the 10 years before the pandemic. However, they were mostly higher than the lows of 20 to 30 years ago.<br/>
教育官员表示，在疫情爆发前的10年里，考试成绩一直在下降。然而，它们大多高于二三十年前的低点。</p>
<p>The latest test scores show that American 13-year-old students are back to their lowest level in math since 1990 and lowest reading level since 2004.<br/>
最新的考试成绩显示，美国13岁学生的数学水平已回到1990年以来的最低水平，阅读水平也回到2004年以来的最低点。</p>
<p>An international reading test given to younger students in 2021 suggested some learning loss. However, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study showed that most students reached basic reading standards. The test results showed that, of the countries taking part, more than one-third of test-takers reached high standards on average. The test, which is administered every five years, was given in 57 countries, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. There was a big difference in results between some countries.<br/>
2021年，一项针对年轻学生的国际阅读测试显示，一些学生出现了学习损失。然而，国际阅读素养研究进展表明，大多数学生达到了基本的阅读标准。测试结果显示，在参加测试的国家中，平均下来有超过三分之一的考生达到了高标准。该测试每五年举办一次，涉及57个学校，主要是在欧洲和中东。一些国家之间的测试结果存在很大差异。</p>
<p>In the U.S., officials say time away from school during the pandemic continues to affect students who were already having problems. Those students scored 12 to 14 points lower than others in their group in 2020. Stronger students also saw lower scores, but their scores dropped only six to eight points.<br/>
官员们表示，美国疫情期间离校时间继续影响着已经存在问题的学生。这些学生的得分比2020年同龄学生低12至14分。学霸的分数也有所下降，但他们的分数只下降了六到八分。</p>
<p>Minority students struggled the most. The lowest scores came from American Indians, whose scores dropped by 20 points. Black students' scores were lower by 13 points. White students saw losses of six points and Asian students remained almost the same. The scores of all groups decreased.<br/>
少数族裔学生的处境最为艰难。得分最低的是美国印第安人，他们的得分下降了20分。黑人学生的分数下降了13分。白人学生的分数下降了6分，而亚裔学生的分数几乎保持不变。整体分数有所下降。</p>
<p>Denise Forte is president of a nonprofit group, the Education Trust, based in Washington, D.C. She said the test shows the deep effect of the pandemic on Black, Latino and poor students.<br/>
丹尼斯·福特是总部位于华盛顿特区的非营利组织“教育信托”的主席。她说，这次测试显示了疫情对黑人、拉丁裔和贫困学生的深刻影响。</p>
<p>She said all students want to do well, attend college, and get a job. "But they can't if they continue to lose ground," she said.<br/>
她说，所有的学生都想考得好，上大学，然后找份工作。她说：“但如果他们继续成绩退步，他们就无法实现。”</p>
<p>The learning problems of the pandemic continue in the U.S. although the federal government has spent billions of dollars to help students catch up.<br/>
尽管联邦政府已花费数十亿美元帮助学生迎头赶上，但疫情带来的学习问题在美国仍在继续。</p>

学校收到了资金用于提供额外帮助、在夏天上课和开办其他课程。</p>

。
[00:00.04]The U.S. Department of Education expressed concern
[00:04.12]about long-term learning loss among teenagers
[00:08.40]who missed class time during the COVID-19 pandemic when schools closed.
[00:15.76]The department released the scores from a national math and reading test,
[00:21.68]given to 13-year-olds, on June 21.
[00:27.00]Eight thousand seven hundred students took the test

[00:36.48]The results showed a drop of nine points in math

[00:51.44]The department's information shows that those are the largest point
[00:56.04]decreases between tests recorded since 1973.
[01:02.44]The test asks students to read short passages
[01:06.96]and identify the main idea or some facts.
[01:11.32]In math, students need to do simple multiplication and geometry.

[01:21.60]of the National Center for Education Statistics,
[01:25.32]part of the Department of Education.
[01:30.40]In a news release, she said the scores show that there are still
[01:34.44]"worrisome signs about student achievement"
[01:38.00]two years after most returned to in-person school.
[01:43.96]Carr said she was hoping to see
[01:46.44]"green shoots of academic recovery," but did not.
[01:50.68]Green shoots is a term officials use to describe signs of improvement.
[01:58.08]The results of a similar test, given to younger students, came out in 2022.
[02:05.12]They also showed learning problems connected
[02:08.72]to missed class time for fourth and eighth graders.
[02:13.72]Education officials said test scores were falling
[02:18.60]in the 10 years before the pandemic.
[02:21.36]However, they were mostly higher than the lows of 20 to 30 years ago.

[02:36.12]are back to their lowest level in math since 1990
[02:41.56]and lowest reading level since 2004.

[04:01.88]The lowest scores came from American Indians,
[04:05.64]whose scores dropped by 20 points.

[04:13.60]White students saw losses of six points
[04:18.00]and Asian students remained almost the same.
[04:21.92]The scores of all groups decreased.
[04:26.56]Denise Forte is president
[04:29.20]of a nonprofit group, the Education Trust, based in Washington, D.C.
[04:35.12]She said the test shows
[04:37.64]the deep effect of the pandemic on Black, Latino and poor students.
[04:43.32]She said all students want to do well, attend college, and get a job.
[04:48.80]"But they can't if they continue to lose ground," she said.
[04:53.72]The learning problems of the pandemic continue in the U.S.

[05:36.00]that it would take "years of investment to reverse the damage."
[05:41.92]But he said "several states" are making progress
[05:45.08]on their own reading and math tests
