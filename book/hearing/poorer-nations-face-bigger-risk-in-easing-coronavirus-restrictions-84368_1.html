一些发达国家已经开始放宽预防新冠病毒的限制措施。许多发展中国家想要放宽对新冠病毒的限制，但是他们承担不起犯错的责任。

发展中国家通常缺乏必要的工具，例如强劲的经济、良好的医院和进行大量检测的能力。他们需要这些工具来克服大流行。</p>

在整个欧洲，人们一直在争论如何更好地放宽限制。然而在受冲突、腐败或贫困影响的国家，这样的辩论似乎是不可想象的。</p>
<p>Lebanon, for example, is a small country with a huge amount of debt. It has a weak health care system and an angry population.<br/>
以黎巴嫩为例，这是一个负债累累的小国家。该国卫生保健系统薄弱，人口众多。</p>

许多其它发展中国家的情况也类似。放宽封锁可能会增加感染并引发严重的医疗危机。另一方面，维持限制要冒造成更大经济损失和社会动荡的风险。</p>

<p>Arezki worries that easing restrictions too early could do "more harm than good" because there is a lack of clear information, he explained.<br/>
由于缺乏明确的信息，阿雷兹基担心过早放宽限制可能会弊大于利。</p>

甚至发达国家也感到担忧。</p>

西方国家正面临严峻的经济问题，但是大型政府财政援助计划减轻了它们的影响。例如，美国出台了一项2.2万亿美元的计划。欧盟国家已经就一项5500亿美元的计划达成一致。</p>
<p>The international community is offering help to poorer nations. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it is prepared to lend $1 trillion to poor nations. The world's richest countries agreed to temporarily suspend poor nations' debts, mainly in Africa.<br/>
国际社会正在给贫困国家提供帮助。国际货币基金组织称其准备向贫困国家提供1万亿美元贷款。世界上最富有国家同意暂时冻结贫困国家的债务，这些国家主要在非洲。</p>
<p>Pakistan's prime minister has appealed to wealthy countries and international organizations to simply forgive the debts of poorer countries. The IMF gave Pakistan $1.5 billion in emergency financing to help with the pandemic.<br/>
巴基斯坦总理已经呼吁发达国家和国际组织免除贫困国家的债务。国际货币基金组织给巴基斯坦提供了15亿美元的紧急资金帮助应对这次大流行。</p>

一些发展中国家已经决定不再等待，并取消了某些行业的限制。在马来西亚，政府允许其半导体和其它主要行业继续经营。哥伦比亚允许煤炭生产商德拉蒙德公司于4月9日部分恢复运营。</p>

[by:www.21voa.com]
[00:00.00]快捷键：S播放/暂停，A快退，D快进，W循环。
[00:02.16]Some wealthier Western nations have begun easing restrictions to guard against the new coronavirus.
[00:12.12]Many developing countries want to ease their coronavirus restrictions,
[00:17.88]but they cannot afford to make a mistake.
[00:22.04]Developing countries often lack the necessary tools, such as a strong economy,
[00:28.88]good hospitals and the ability to do a lot of testing.
[00:35.12]They need these things to overcome the pandemic.
[00:39.28]Across Europe, people have been debating how best to ease the restrictions.
[00:46.44]Yet such a debate seems unthinkable in countries affected by conflict, corruption or poverty.
[00:55.96]Lebanon, for example, is a small country with a huge amount of debt.
[01:02.16]It has a weak health care system and an angry population.
[01:08.48]A month of coronavirus restrictions has sent tens of thousands more Lebanese into poverty.
[01:17.44]The government is under pressure to ease some of the restrictions.
[01:22.84]Medical supplies are so limited, however, that doctors are calling for the measures to stay in place.
[01:31.56]Lebanon was one of the first countries in the Middle East to close schools and restaurants because of the virus.
[01:40.80]On March 16, Lebanon entered a total lockdown until April 26.
[01:48.12]Its prime minister asked for patience as the country faced an "enormous economic price."
[01:56.28]The International Monetary Fund reported last week that Lebanon's economy
[02:02.76]may shrink by as much as 12 percent in 2020.
[02:08.12]That would be the largest economic downturn in the Middle East.
[02:13.40]The situation is similar in many other developing countries:
[02:18.72]Easing lockdowns could increase infections and set off a serious medical crisis.
[02:26.92]At the same time, keeping restrictions in place risks more economic losses and social unrest.
[02:36.64]The inability to test and a government unwilling to be truthful
[02:41.76]could lead to bad decisions, warns Rabah Arezki.
[02:47.76]He is chief economist for the Middle East and North Africa at the World Bank.
[02:55.16]Arezki worries that easing restrictions too early could do "more harm than good"
[03:02.16]because there is a lack of clear information, he explained.
[03:07.44]Even wealthier nations are also worried.
[03:11.20]Germany has Europe's largest economy.
[03:14.64]Last week, German officials announced a small easing of restrictions,
[03:20.00]which includes reopening most stores.
[03:24.24]But Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that restarting the economy too quickly
[03:31.16]could lead to problems with the health care system.
[03:35.80]Western nations are facing severe economic problems,
[03:40.12]but their effects are eased by large government financial aid programs.
[03:46.64]For example, the United States has a $2.2 trillion program.
[03:54.92]The EU countries have agreed on a $550 billion program.
[04:01.92]The international community is offering help to poorer nations.
[04:08.00]The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it is prepared to lend $1 trillion to poor nations.
[04:18.44]The world's richest countries agreed to temporarily suspend poor nations' debts, mainly in Africa.
[04:27.28]Pakistan's prime minister has appealed to wealthy countries and international organizations
[04:34.56]to simply forgive the debts of poorer countries.
[04:39.12]The IMF gave Pakistan $1.5 billion in emergency financing to help with the pandemic.
[04:49.76]Some developing nations have decided they can no longer wait and are lifting restrictions for some industries.
[04:59.56]In Malaysia, the government permitted its semiconductor and other major industries to continue operating.
[05:09.16]Colombia permitted coal producer Drummond to restart part of its operations on April 9.
[05:17.56]In Yemen, Libya and Syria, years of conflict have led to humanitarian disasters.
[05:25.96]In all three countries, the level of coronavirus outbreak is unknown.
[05:32.12]There is a lack of testing, medical supplies and trained health care workers.
