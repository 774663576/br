<p>Sherif said the organization provided $2.5 million to help nearly 75,000 children in Haiti with money, food and other programs. And she asked the European Union and other countries, including France and the U.S., to help close the educational deficit.</p>

<p>Bissainthe added, "I hope that the generation that comes after me doesn't have to go through the same suffering.”</p>

[00:01.88]Schools in Haiti are operating
[00:04.72]without enough chairs, blackboards,
[00:07.36]and even bathrooms.
[00:10.24]Violent criminal groups
[00:11.88]limit basic government services
[00:14.80]and deepen poverty
[00:16.64]while the state education system

[00:23.24]Yasmine Sherif is the executive director
[00:26.68]of the U.N. organization Education Cannot Wait.
[00:31.52]"The country needs help," Sherif said
