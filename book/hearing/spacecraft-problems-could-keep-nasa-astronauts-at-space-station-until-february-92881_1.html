<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Spacecraft Problems Could Keep NASA Astronauts at Space Station until February]

。
[00:00.04]Two American astronauts could remain
[00:03.36]at the International Space Station (ISS)
[00:07.76]until February if the spacecraft
[00:11.04]that transported them cannot be fixed
[00:14.68]to safely bring them home.
[00:17.28]The U.S. space agency NASA said last week
[00:22.64]it had not yet made return plans
[00:26.12]for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
[00:31.00]The two have been aboard the ISS since June 6.
[00:36.80]The American astronauts were expected
[00:40.40]to stay in space for only a week.
[00:43.68]But technical issues with
[00:46.08]the Boeing-built Starliner spacecraft
[00:49.64]have so far prevented a return trip.
[00:53.56]The trip that carried Wilmore and Williams
[00:57.32]was a test flight for Starliner
[01:00.20]that marked the first time the spacecraft
[01:04.16]successfully carried astronauts to space.
[01:08.60]NASA officials held a news conference Wednesday
[01:13.52]to discuss the ongoing situation with Starliner
[01:18.20]and the astronauts at the ISS.
[01:22.12]They said the agency is still working with Boeing
[01:26.96]to find a solution for the spacecraft's technical difficulties.
[01:32.64]Investigations have centered on helium leaks
[01:37.24]and thruster problems with Starliner.
[01:41.72]But if those issues
[01:44.00]cannot be resolved in the coming weeks,
[01:47.00]NASA said it could decide to use
[01:50.44]SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft
[01:54.28]to bring the astronauts back to Earth.
[01:57.52]NASA has been using SpaceX's Crew Dragon
[02:02.60]to regularly carry astronauts
[02:05.48]and supplies to the ISS since 2020.
[02:10.16]If NASA decides to use Crew Dragon,
[02:14.64]it said it would leave two of four seats open
[02:18.96]during the spacecraft's next planned launch
[02:22.68]to the ISS in late September.
[02:25.88]Wilmore and Williams would
[02:28.20]then make the trip back to Earth with Crew Dragon.
[02:32.44]NASA officials told reporters
[02:36.20]they had brought in additional experts
[02:39.16]to examine Starliner's leak issues
[02:42.84]and thruster failures.
[02:45.20]At the same time, the space agency
[02:48.44]is looking more closely at SpaceX
[02:52.36]as a backup solution
[02:54.40]to get the astronauts back home.
[02:57.80]The agency's space operations mission chief,
[03:02.64]Ken Bowersox, said NASA's current thinking is that
[03:07.32]"we could take either path."
[03:10.32]He added that during a recent meeting,
[03:14.00]"We heard from a lot of folks
[03:16.28]that had concern, and the decision was not clear."
[03:20.76]NASA has said a final decision
[03:24.24]should be made by mid-August.
[03:27.36]Boeing representatives
[03:29.68]did not take part in the news conference.
[03:32.72]But the company issued a brief statement Wednesday
[03:36.64]repeating its position that Starliner could still be fixed
[03:41.84]to safely transport the astronauts.
[03:45.08]"We still believe in Starliner's capability
[03:49.48]and its flight rationale," Boeing said.
[03:53.40]The Boeing statement said if NASA
[03:57.32]did decide to change Starliner's mission,
[04:01.04]the company would "take the actions necessary
[04:04.88]to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return."
[04:10.36]Steve Stich is the commercial
[04:13.68]crew program manager for NASA.
[04:16.80]He said the agency was not seriously considering
[04:21.68]launching a separate SpaceX flight
[04:25.04]to pick up Wilmore and Williams.
[04:28.52]Officials said tests
[04:31.20]run by Boeing and NASA on Earth
[04:34.52]have reproduced Starliner's thruster problems.
[04:39.48]This has suggested to engineers
[04:42.60]a possible issue with the thruster's seals.
[04:47.40]But Stich noted it was not clear
[04:50.60]what is causing the seal issues.
[04:54.00]The thrusters are important
[04:56.72]for permitting Starliner
[04:58.80]to back away from the ISS
[05:01.60]during its separation operations.
[05:04.84]At the same time, engineers are seeking
[05:08.40]to find the cause of helium leaks
[05:11.52]in the spacecraft's propulsion system.
[05:15.00]The first leak happened before the launch,
[05:18.48]but more appeared during flight.
[05:21.64]Boeing has faced repeated delays
[05:25.44]as it struggles to complete NASA's
[05:28.40]flight testing process
[05:30.48]before it can receive approval
[05:33.04]to start running official trips to the ISS.
[05:38.12]I'm Bryan Lynn.
