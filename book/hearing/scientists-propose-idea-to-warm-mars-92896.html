。
[00:00.04]The idea of turning Mars
[00:03.44]into a livable world for humans
[00:06.80]is a common element of science fiction.
[00:10.40]But could such an action be done in real life?
[00:14.52]Scientists are now proposing a new method
[00:18.72]to warm up Earth's planetary neighbor.
[00:22.04]The idea involves putting engineered
[00:25.20]particles made of iron or aluminum
[00:28.52]into the atmosphere.
[00:30.56]The goal is to trap escaping heat
[00:33.80]and direct sunlight toward the Martian surface.
[00:38.48]The proposed idea would be
[00:41.00]to increase the natural greenhouse effect on Mars
[00:45.20]and raise its surface temperature
[00:48.12]by around 28 degrees Celsius over ten years.
[00:53.40]Such a change alone
[00:55.56]would not make Mars livable for people.
[00:58.72]But the scientists who developed the idea
[01:02.96]see it as a possible first step.
[01:06.32]Edwin Kite of the University of Chicago
[01:10.36]helped lead the study that appeared recently
[01:13.96]in the publication Science Advances.
[01:17.92]Kite described the process of terraforming
[01:21.60]– meaning to change a planet's environment
[01:24.68]to be more like Earth.
[01:27.08]"For Mars, warming the planet is a necessary,
[01:31.04]but insufficient, first step.
[01:35.04]Previous concepts have focused
[01:37.48]on releasing greenhouse gases,
[01:39.96]but these require large amounts of resources
[01:43.52]that are scarce on Mars," he said.
[01:46.96]Kite added that climate modeling suggests
[01:50.84]the new idea of using engineered
[01:53.72]particles to warm Mars' atmosphere
[01:57.00]could work better than previous ideas.
[02:00.72]Kite explained that the work is important
[02:04.44]because it presents a possible method
[02:07.68]that could help future exploration plans.
[02:11.96]NASA has sent robotic vehicles
[02:14.68]to explore the Martian surface
[02:17.16]and the InSight Lander
[02:19.32]to study the planet's interior.
[02:21.96]The U.S. space agency's Artemis program
[02:25.64]aims to put astronauts in the coming years
[02:29.40]on the moon's surface for the first time
[02:32.64]since 1972 in preparation
[02:36.20]for possible future human missions to Mars.
[02:39.88]There are several barriers
[02:42.28]to human settlements on Mars.
[02:45.08]They include a lack of breathable oxygen,
[02:49.00]harmful ultraviolet radiation,
[02:52.24]salty soil, and dust storms
[02:55.88]that sometimes cover much of the planet.
[02:59.20]And Mars' cold temperatures are a serious issue.
[03:04.56]The median Martian surface temperature
[03:07.28]is about minus-65 degrees Celsius.
[03:11.64]With its thin atmosphere,
[03:14.24]solar heat on the Martian surface
[03:16.84]easily escapes into space.
[03:19.52]The proposal would aim to permit
[03:22.52]liquid water to exist on the surface of Mars,
[03:26.84]which has water in the form of ice
[03:30.16]at its polar areas and its subsurface.
[03:34.60]The scientists proposed
[03:37.28]continuously releasing tiny particles,
[03:40.44]called nanorods, into the atmosphere
[03:43.96]at a rate of about 30 liters per second for years.
[03:49.04]Samaneh Ansari of Northwestern University in Illinois
[03:54.28]is the study's lead writer.
[03:57.00]Ansari said, "The idea
[04:00.24]is to either ship the material or better yet,
[04:03.96]ship the manufacturing tool
[04:06.48]and make the nanorods on the planet
[04:09.24]since iron and aluminum are abundant
[04:12.12]on the surface of Mars."
[04:14.52]The researchers are mindful of the possibility
[04:18.48]of unintended consequences
[04:21.28]in terraforming another world.
[04:24.12]Scientists, for instance, are eager to learn
[04:28.48]whether Mars has held life in the past
[04:31.36]- or perhaps currently,
[04:33.36]in the form of subsurface microbes.
[04:36.72]Kite suggested that the costs and benefits
[04:40.84]of releasing nanorods are uncertain.
[04:44.16]For example, he said if Mars' soil
[04:48.32]has compounds that are harmful to life from Earth,
[04:52.40]then the benefit of warming Mars is zero.
