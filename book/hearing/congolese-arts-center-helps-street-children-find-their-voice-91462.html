。
[00:00.04]A small recording room outside the Congolese capital Kinshasa
[00:06.64]has become a safe space for homeless teenagers.
[00:12.24]They sing about their life on the streets
[00:15.04]and dream of a better future.
[00:18.52]The homeless sing about sexual abuse, stealing, theft,
[00:23.60]and dealings with the police
[00:26.64]at the Mokili Na Poche cultural center.
[00:31.96]It is a safe space that permits young people
[00:35.64]and children to wash, eat, and learn.
[00:40.64]"It really makes me happy when I sing,"
[00:43.76]said 19-year-old Osé Mavakala.
[00:48.80]He has slept on the streets for years.
[00:52.56]There are more than 20,000 homeless children in Kinshasa,
[00:59.04]UNICEF, the U.N. agency, has found.
[01:03.80]Other teenagers looked on with happiness as Mavakala
[01:09.04]rapped into the recording equipment
[01:11.88]at the center in late August.
[01:15.92]Mavakala dreams of bigger goals
[01:19.36]after having the chance to record in a real recording space.
[01:25.40]He said, "It encourages me
[01:28.28]and I tell myself - ah, life belongs to the courageous."
[01:34.40]He added that U.S. rapper Lil Wayne
[01:37.52]and Congolese star Fally Ipupa influenced his music.
[01:44.80]He has been coming to the center for the past three years,
[01:49.28]taking part in the music, art,
[01:52.32]and reading classes it offers throughout the day.
[01:57.24]Founder Cedrick Tshimbalanga hopes these skills
[02:02.20]and daily experiences will help the children build a base
[02:07.00]for their life and their voices.
[02:10.84]"With music...young people are able
[02:13.88]to talk about their daily experience -
[02:16.80]everything they live through daily:
[02:19.28]rape, theft, trauma, attacks," said Tshimbalanga,
[02:25.80]who plans to release their music soon.
[02:29.88]The classes are also a chance for young people
[02:33.76]to make up for lost possibilities in life.
[02:38.36]While the Democratic Republic of Congo
[02:41.40]has made progress in education,
[02:44.52]over 7 million children aged between five and 17
[02:49.88]still do not have schooling, UNICEF found.
[02:54.92]"Break free from the criminal life, my friend,
[02:58.00]it's time to see what the future holds for you,"
[03:01.32]Mavakala rapped during an emotion-filled performance
[03:06.16]at the center in August.
