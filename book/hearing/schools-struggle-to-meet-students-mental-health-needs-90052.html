<p>Some of the extra need for support has been taken by social workers. The number of social workers has grown by nearly 50 percent since before the pandemic, national data shows.

<p>"For all the talk about mental health, the actual money they're spending on it is not that high," said Phyllis Jordan. She is with FutureEd at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. The group measures school spending. School districts only planned to spend about 2 percent of the largest round of federal COVID aid on mental health hiring, the group found.</p>
<p>There has been an increase, however, in social workers.</p>
<p>The <em>Chalkbeat</em> analysis found that the number of school social workers was up 48 percent this fall compared with before the pandemic. The number of school counselors was up 12 percent and the number of school psychologists increased just 4 percent.</p>

[00:00.04]School systems across the United States
[00:02.80]have struggled to find workers
[00:04.92]to deal with students' mental health needs.
[00:07.92]Mental health problems among students have worsened
[00:11.76]since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
[00:15.92]Chalkbeat found that among 18 of the country's largest school districts,
[00:21.40]12 started the school year this autumn with fewer counselors
[00:26.00]or psychologists than they had in the fall of 2019.
[00:32.00]As a result, many school mental health professionals
