。
[00:00.04]A U.S.-based developer of a brain-computer implant
[00:05.04]is reportedly preparing to carry out
[00:08.08]major testing of its device on humans.
[00:12.44]The company is called Synchron.
[00:15.88]The Reuters news agency reported
[00:18.88]that Synchron recently launched on online system
[00:23.08]that permits patients to express interest
[00:26.60]in taking part in a large research study, or trial.
[00:32.04]The company has also been in contact
[00:35.12]with more than 100 research centers
[00:38.72]that want to support the study,
[00:41.08]Synchron chief executive Thomas Oxley told Reuters.
[00:46.56]Synchron's device is known as a brain-computer interface.
[00:52.20]It is designed to treat individuals who experience
[00:56.64]paralysis caused by injury or disease.
[01:01.24]The device contains a small computer
[01:04.84]built to electronically communicate with the brain.
[01:09.36]The first tests aim to use the brain-computer interface
[01:15.08]to process brain signals
[01:17.64]to help paralyzed patients type on a computer.
[01:22.60]Synchron's interface is similar to a device
[01:26.68]currently being tested by its American competitor, Neuralink.
[01:32.28]One difference is that Neuralink's device
[01:35.88]is designed to be implanted inside the skull.
[01:40.64]Synchron's device uses
[01:43.04]a less invasive implant method known as endovascular.
[01:48.72]The company says this involves a vein carrying the device
[01:53.88]into a part of the brain known as the motor cortex.
[01:58.48]This part of the brain produces signals
[02:02.44]to direct body movements.
[02:04.88]Synchron is farther along in the development of its implant
[02:09.92]than Neuralink, Reuters reports.
[02:13.56]Neuralink's progress has mainly been announced
[02:17.60]by company chief Elon Musk
[02:20.20]on the X social media service that he owns.
[02:24.40]So far, Neuralink has said its device
[02:28.28]has been implanted in one paralyzed patient.
[02:32.68]Testing implants in patients with brain damage can be difficult.
[02:38.44]This is because an individual's brain
[02:41.80]may be so severely damaged
[02:44.32]that there is not effective signaling to record.
[02:48.52]Synchron's Oxley said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[02:55.60]asked his company to test stroke patients
[02:59.60]using a non-invasive method
[03:02.28]to see if they would be good implant candidates.
[03:06.48]In 2020, Synchron said experiments
[03:10.52]involving paralyzed patients in Australia
[03:14.52]found the individuals could use its device
[03:18.12]to type letters into a computer
[03:21.12]at a higher rate than in earlier studies.
[03:25.16]Synchron received U.S. approval in July 2021
[03:30.60]to carry out early testing.
[03:33.12]It has implanted its devices in six patients so far.
[03:38.40]Tests involving four patients in Australia
[03:42.40]showed no serious side effects,
[03:45.60]the company has reported.
[03:47.84]Synchron says it will be examining data from its current testing
[03:53.24]to prepare for the larger study.
[03:56.60]The company must still receive FDA approval
[04:00.64]to move forward with the new study.
[04:03.60]Several U.S. hospitals have cooperated with Synchron
[04:08.64]on its current testing program.
[04:11.48]These include Mount Sinai in New York,
[04:15.40]the University at Buffalo Neurosurgery
[04:19.24]and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).
[04:24.56]The company has said it hopes to involve
[04:28.00]these same medical centers in the larger trial.
[04:32.28]Dr. David Lacomis is chief of UPMC's Neuromuscular Division.
[04:39.60]He told Reuters his team is still involved
[04:43.72]in the current testing program
[04:46.08]and said "the study is going well."
[04:49.56]The Department of Neurosurgery in the Jacobs School of Medicine
[04:54.72]and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo
[04:59.20]has two patients in the current test program.
[05:03.24]The head of that effort is department chief Dr. Elad Levy.
[05:09.04]He told Reuters, "the first and only stroke patient"
[05:14.20]is taking part in the study.
[05:16.52]Levy said he feels that is important
[05:20.28]because this is a large population
[05:23.28]that might see improvements from Synchron's device.
[05:27.92]He added that he was hopeful and excited
[05:31.88]about the new research
[05:33.80]and future deployment of the technology.
