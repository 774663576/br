<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:Study: Boss Paid 271 Times More than Average Worker]

。
[00:01.48]The chief executive officers of America's largest companies
[00:06.92]were paid an average of $15.6 million in 2016,
[00:14.12]says a recent study by an economic research group.
[00:18.66]The Economic Policy Institute published the report
[00:22.96]written by Lawrence Mischel and Jessica Schieder.
[00:27.36]They say the average business leader's pay was 271 times
[00:33.72]what an average worker earns at the companies they studied.
[00:39.08]This chief executive-to-worker pay ratio
[00:42.72]is smaller than it has been in the past few years.
[00:47.40]In 2014, the ratio was 299-to-1, according to the report.
[00:55.96]However, it is still much higher than the 20-to-1 ratio
[01:01.60]between chief executives and workers in 1965.
[01:07.16]In 1989, that difference was 59-to-1.
[01:12.24]In the last 30 years, the salaries of chief executive officers, or CEOs,
[01:19.60]has grown much faster than the pay of the average worker
[01:23.68]at the companies they oversee.
[01:26.84]In addition, CEO's pay has increased much faster
[01:32.08]than the value of stock shares in the companies they lead.
[01:36.84]To get their results, the researchers added up employees' pay,
[01:41.56]special rights to buy stock at lower than market prices, and bonuses.
[01:48.36]The Economic Policy Institute is a research organization
[01:52.39]that studies the concerns of low- and middle-income workers.
[01:58.60]According to the website Salary.com,  CEOs are paid very high salaries
[02:06.24]because their skills and responsibilities are "extreme."
[02:10.82]They say there is only a limited number of people who can perform these job duties.
[02:19.16]The report also noted the earnings of low-paid workers.
[02:23.76]The lowest paid full-time U.S. workers earn a minimum wage of about $15,000 a year.
[02:31.96]The minimum wage is the lowest amount of hourly pay
[02:35.76]a company can legally pay its employee.
[02:39.60]Most workers in the U.S. earn more than the minimum wage,
[02:44.48]and many states have a higher minimum wage than the federal limit.
[02:50.64]However, workers who earn the least amount of money in the study
[02:56.16]earn about one 1,000th the pay of the highest earning CEOs.
[03:02.76]The U.S. federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
[03:09.72]It has not been increased in eight years.
[03:13.44]According to the group Business for a Fair Minimum Wage,
[03:17.56]the buying power of that amount has decreased
[03:21.18]by about 15% because of inflation.
[03:26.28]The issue of raising the federal minimum wage has been controversial.
[03:31.56]Many businesses say that raising the minimum wage
[03:35.08]will result in fewer low-paying jobs.
[03:39.32]The group Business for a Fair Minimum Wage disagrees.
[03:42.92]It said that raising the minimum wage for the lowest-paid workers
[03:48.24]could help the economy by increasing the amount of money people have to spend.
