[00:00.04]Imagine a wheelchair equipped
[00:03.68]with wheels flexible enough
[00:06.36]to move over all kinds of barriers:
[00:10.20]including the raised edges of streets.
[00:15.04]A robotic delivery vehicle
[00:17.84]could use the same wheels to go up stairs
[00:22.36]to deliver food or other purchases.
[00:26.44]This is what researchers
[00:28.88]from the Korea Institute of Machinery
[00:32.44]and Materials (KIMM)
[00:36.20]see as the future for their 'morphing' wheel.
[00:40.32]The wheels can change their shape
[00:43.96]and can roll over barriers
[00:46.48]up to 1.3 times their radius.
[00:52.16]The radius of a wheel is half its height.
[00:57.28]Other possible applications
[01:00.04]for the morphing wheel include robots
[01:03.80]that gather information about
[01:06.16]an enemy in the battlefield.
[01:10.00]The KIMM team also hopes
[01:13.72]that morphing wheels will one day be used
[01:18.08]with two and four-legged robots.
[01:21.84]Now, the movement of those machines is limited.
[01:27.44]Too much shaking is also a problem.
[01:31.56]With the morphing wheels, the robots
[01:35.68]could carry objects that need
[01:38.36]smooth movement for industrial use.
[01:42.68]Song Sung-hyuk is the lead researcher
[01:45.88]at South Korea's KIMM
[01:48.88]and a member of the AI robotics research team.
[01:53.72]He said the goal is to make the wheels work
[01:58.00]at the average speed of a car.
[02:01.28]That is about 100 kilometers per hour.
[02:06.32]Wheels developed for a similar purpose,
[02:09.72]such as airless wheels, have flexibility
[02:14.72]but are limited in their ability
[02:18.20]to overcome barriers, said Song.
[02:22.80]The difference between airless wheels
[02:26.00]and the morphing wheel is that
[02:29.12]airless wheels are always soft,
[02:32.24]but the morphing wheels can change
[02:35.24]from hard to soft when they meet a barrier.
[02:38.80]They can then return to being hard
[02:42.72]to permit faster travel
[02:44.92]where there are no barriers.
[02:47.84]The morphing wheel is made
[02:50.04]of an outer circle of chain
[02:53.12]and a series of wires
[02:55.24]running through its central hub.
[02:59.08]A sensor controls the stiffness of the wires
[03:03.24]in reaction to the barriers in its path.
[03:07.80]Song's team demonstrated to Reuters
[03:11.04]a model of a wheelchair riding on morphing wheels
[03:15.52]as it climbed stairs with 18-cm steps.
[03:20.96]The team has also tested a device
[03:24.32]using the wheel at speeds of up to
[03:27.60]30 kilometers an hour.
