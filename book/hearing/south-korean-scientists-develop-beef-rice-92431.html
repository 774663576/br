。
[00:01.88]South Korean researchers have combined
[00:04.68]cow muscle cells with rice grains.
[00:08.76]They say the new rice is an important step
[00:11.72]towards a sustainable, less costly source of protein.
[00:16.28]The researchers suggested it could replace
[00:19.16]the meat of farmed cattle, or beef.
[00:22.68]Professor Jinkee Hong of Yonsei University
[00:25.64]led the research.
[00:27.96]Hong said the "beef rice"
[00:29.92]is the first product of its kind.
[00:33.12]The results of the research
[00:34.56]were recently published in Matter.
[00:37.76]The beef rice uses grain particles as the base
[00:41.36]for growing animal muscle and fat cells.
[00:45.32]The researchers treated rice grains
[00:47.48]with chemicals called enzymes
[00:49.80]to create an environment for cell growth.
[00:53.92]They added cells from cattle
[00:55.88]to create the final product,
[00:57.72]which is a combination, or hybrid, of the two.
[01:02.40]The result looks like a grain of rice
[01:04.92]with a pink color.
[01:07.44]Companies around the world have launched efforts
[01:10.56]to develop meat that is grown in a laboratory.
[01:14.80]One of the latest attempts involves
[01:17.00]plant-based chicken and eel meat
[01:20.04]developed from soybean that is sold in Singapore.
[01:24.56]Hong's team said rice has an added gain
[01:27.72]in terms of safety compared to soy or nuts
[01:31.96]because fewer people have allergic reactions to it.
[01:36.40]He said that if it is developed into food products,
[01:39.76]"cultured beef rice could serve
[01:42.00]as a sustainable protein source."
[01:45.32]He added that it would be good in environments
[01:48.12]where traditional animal farming is too difficult.
[01:52.40]The beef rice contains around
[01:54.36]eight percent more protein
[01:56.32]and seven percent more fat than normal rice.
[02:01.28]Hong noted the protein is 18 percent animal based.
[02:06.56]That makes it a good source of important nutrients
[02:10.08]needed by humans called essential amino acids.
[02:15.00]Beef rice costs about two dollars per kilogram.
[02:18.68]Hong said it results in the release of less carbon gas
[02:23.28]than traditional cattle raising.
[02:26.24]He said that it could compete
[02:28.28]with other products in stores.
[02:31.56]Hong said there are still some problems in production.
[02:35.24]And, he added, it will not be easy
[02:38.44]to get people to accept its taste
[02:40.84]and how it feels in the mouth, or its texture.
[02:46.08]Keum Dong-kyu recently ate the beef rice
[02:49.24]at a restaurant in the Korean capital Seoul.
[02:52.92]He praised the new idea.
[02:55.24]Keum said, "But honestly,
[02:58.36]I don't think it can replicate the juiciness
[03:01.04]or texture of real beef."
[03:03.88]Christian Krammel, who is from Germany,
[03:06.16]expressed hope for the future.
[03:09.20]Krammel said, "Now, it does not compare to beef yet,
[03:13.08]but as I see the research is in early stages,
[03:16.72]I would say it's a great way forward."
