<p>NASA said the research was led by Alexander Pavlov, a planetary scientist at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.

<p>During that experiment, researchers observed that the collection of soil on top formed an icy, salty <strong>crust</strong>. Changes in conditions caused the ice to melt, turning the solid material into a gas and leaving the salt behind.</p>
<p>Pavlov's team tested five samples of frozen soil containing different kinds of salt material commonly found on Mars.

[00:00.04]Scientists are seeking to find out what is producing
[00:05.24]the slow release of methane gas on Mars.
[00:10.40]Methane often results from biological processes.
[00:15.88]On Earth, most of the gas comes from living creatures.
[00:21.12]For this reason, the American space agency NASA
[00:26.52]has been investigating methane levels on Mars
[00:30.80]in a search for signs of current or past life.
[00:35.68]So far, no evidence has been found.
[00:39.48]But a new study is providing
[00:42.20]fresh details about methane on Mars.
[00:46.04]NASA's Curiosity explorer, or rover,
[00:50.88]has repeatedly measured methane levels
[00:54.28]on the Martian surface.
[00:56.64]The rover arrived on Mars in 2012
[01:01.08]and has been exploring areas around Gale Crater.
[01:05.60]This area is believed to have contained
[01:09.96]a lake at one time
[01:12.12]and has also shown other evidence
[01:14.96]of flowing water in the past.
[01:18.08]NASA says Gale Crater
[01:21.32]is the only place where methane has been discovered.
[01:25.68]Even a spacecraft sent
[01:28.32]to collect data on the Martian atmosphere
[01:31.60]has not identified the presence of methane.
[01:35.60]That spacecraft, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter,
[01:40.88]is operated by the European Space Agency.
[01:44.84]In addition to only being discovered,
[01:48.40]or detected, around Gale Crater,
[01:51.92]the observations of methane happen only at night,
[01:55.96]NASA researchers recently reported.
[01:59.84]Levels also go up and down during different seasons
[02:04.76]and at times, rise sharply for short periods.
[02:09.80]The mysterious methane releases
[02:13.12]leave scientists considering "a lot of plot twists,"
[02:18.04]said Curiosity project leader Ashwin Vasavada.
[02:23.16]But a NASA research group
[02:25.96]recently proposed a possible explanation
[02:29.88]for how the gas behaves on Mars.
[02:33.80]The researchers theorize
[02:36.60]that all detected methane could be trapped, or sealed,
[02:41.60]underneath hardened pieces of salt in Martian regolith.
[02:46.88]Regolith describes soil
[02:50.00]that contains rock and dust
[02:52.80]that sits on or below the surface.
[02:56.52]The scientists say increases in temperature
[03:00.48]might explain the differences in gas release.
[03:04.60]During certain seasons or times of day
[03:08.48]warmer temperatures could weaken the seal
[03:11.64]on the methane, causing gas to be released.
[03:15.68]NASA said the research was led by Alexander Pavlov,
[03:21.16]a planetary scientist at the agency's
[03:25.24]Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
[03:28.72]He said small amounts of methane
[03:32.44]could also be released when the regolith
[03:35.48]seal is broken by weight from above,
[03:38.96]for example, when the Curiosity rover
[03:42.52]drives over the area.
[03:44.68]Pavlov said this theory could help explain
[03:48.92]why methane levels have only been discovered
[03:52.20]in the Gale Crater area.
[03:55.28]It is the only place on Mars
[03:57.84]where NASA's Curiosity rover is currently active.
[04:02.28]NASA has another rover working on Mars, Perseverance.
[04:08.20]But it has been exploring the Jezero Crater area
[04:12.12]on another part of the planet.
[04:14.84]Jezero Crater is also believed
[04:18.20]to have contained large water bodies
[04:21.28]in the distant past.
[04:23.60]But Perseverance is not equipped
[04:26.40]with a methane-detecting instrument.
[04:29.56]Pavlov noted that the latest theory
[04:33.28]came from his memories of an unrelated experiment
[04:37.68]carried out in 2017.
[04:40.52]The experiment involved growing microorganisms
[04:45.08]in a simulated Martian environment
[04:48.52]that included frozen soil that contained salt.
[04:52.72]During that experiment, researchers observed
[04:56.88]that the collection of soil on top
[05:00.00]formed an icy, salty crust.
[05:03.20]Changes in conditions caused the ice to melt,
[05:07.64]turning the solid material into a gas
[05:11.00]and leaving the salt behind.
[05:13.32]Pavlov's team tested five samples of frozen soil
[05:18.88]containing different kinds of salt material
[05:22.16]commonly found on Mars.
[05:24.76]A new set of Earth-based experiments was carried out
[05:29.12]in which the frozen material
[05:31.44]was exposed to different temperatures and air pressures
[05:36.32]inside an environment at Goddard
[05:38.92]that was designed to be like Mars.
[05:42.52]The team was able to repeatedly copy
[05:45.88]the salt sealing process
[05:48.28]in Mars-like conditions during laboratory testing.
[05:52.52]The researchers said they plan
[05:55.20]to keep carrying out experiments
[05:57.84]under different conditions and using salt minerals
[06:01.76]to confirm their theory.
[06:04.04]But the researchers noted that
[06:06.88]to carry out more detailed methane investigations,
[06:10.88]they will likely need a whole new
[06:13.56]generation of sensitive instruments.
[06:16.72]These would be designed
[06:19.44]to measure methane continuously
[06:22.36]from many places on Mars.
