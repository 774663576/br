[ar:Mario Ritter]
[al:Economics Report]

[00:00.00]From VOA Learning English,
[00:02.67]this is the Economics Report.
[00:05.62]Chinese investment in Australia
[00:08.48]has moved to the real estate market and infrastructure.
[00:13.21]It is yet another sign
[00:15.15]that Australia's once strong mining industry is weakening,
[00:20.33]as Chinese businesses look for new places to invest.
[00:25.20]For the first time, almost half
[00:28.63]of all Chinese investment in Australia is in real estate.
[00:33.18]Spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure has also increased.
[00:40.08]Private businesses from China are also investing more than state-owned enterprises.
[00:47.79]The findings are contained in a report
[00:51.00]called "Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia."
[00:55.61]It comes from accounting company KPMG Australia,
[01:00.90]the University of Sydney Business School and the China Studies Center.
[01:06.88]Hans Hendrischke is a professor of Chinese Business and Management
[01:12.19]at the University of Sydney Business School.
[01:15.17]He says the study provides examples of what he calls new patterns of interest.
[01:22.86]"The most striking feature was the change in Chinese investment composition
[01:27.70]– that is the shift from big projects in the mining
[01:31.67]and resources area to this huge increase in real estate,
[01:36.88]and other industries where the Chinese traditionally had not been too strong,
[01:40.68]such as leisure and construction.
[01:42.67]They have bought one of the biggest cinema chains in Australia
[01:46.39]and one of the two biggest construction firms, John Holland."
[01:48.85]Australia's mining industry was expanding a few years ago.
[01:53.40]Now, the rate of growth appears to be slowing.
[01:57.15]Chinese companies with money to spend have looked to real estate as a place to invest.
[02:04.95]However, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board
[02:09.14]must approve what properties the companies can buy.
[02:13.37]Phil Harris is the managing director of Harris Real Estate in Adelaide.
[02:19.17]He says Chinese buyers are inflating prices in Australia's major cities.
[02:26.12]Last year, the Chinese invested $8.3 billion in Australia.
[02:32.82]The combination of real estate, leisure serves and infrastructure projects
[02:39.16]made up 79 percent of new Chinese business in the country.
[02:45.43]That compares with just 11 percent for mining.
[02:50.49]While real estate is the most popular investment,
[02:55.35]there is growing interest, too, in Australian agriculture.
[03:00.46]Andrew Forrest got rich from mining businesses.
[03:04.58]He says Chinese investment is helping to increase the productivity of farming.
[03:11.68]"So far, Chinese investment into Australia - agriculture - has been well received
[03:15.98]and they're capable of being a strong and passive partner
[03:18.75]in projects of massive scale which our capital alone could not develop."
[03:23.34]The falling value of the Australian dollar
[03:26.84]has made investments in the country more appealing. E
[03:30.83]asing of Australian visa rules has also attracted investment.
[03:37.45]Doug Ferguson is head of KPMG Australia's Asia Business Group.
[03:44.84]He co-wrote the report on China's investment in Australia.
[03:51.28]He says Chinese investment is good news.
[03:56.16]"I think it is very important for our economy to be able
[04:00.65]to successfully move the structure away from mining, gas and power
[04:04.94]into sectors that have more, maybe,
[04:08.15]enduring long-term benefit to the broader economy,
[04:11.76]which I think real estate, which leisure and tourism
[04:14.53]and agri business (and) food offers,
[04:16.32]and that is exactly what is happening, so it is very good news."
[04:19.59]China is the sixth largest foreign investor in Australia.
[04:24.42]The United States and Britain invest more,
[04:28.96]although Chinese spending is growing fastest.
[04:33.60]The flow of money from China is a politically sensitive issue,
[04:38.55]especially purchases of real estate and farms.
[04:43.03]Last weekend, Australian nationalists demonstrated
[04:48.08]and burned flags near China's diplomatic offices in Sydney.
[04:53.39]They were protesting what they described as a "foreign invasion."
[04:58.99]And that's the VOA Learning English Economics Report.
[05:04.40]I'm Mario Ritter.
