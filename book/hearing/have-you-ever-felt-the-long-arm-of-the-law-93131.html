。
[00:00.04]
[00:08.36]And now, Words and Their Stories,
[00:11.96]from VOA Learning English.
[00:19.20]Laws help to keep society running smoothly.
[00:23.72]They help to keep things in order.
[00:27.96]So, when we talk about law and order,
[00:31.16]we are talking about
[00:32.68]how crime should be kept under control
[00:35.56]and how society should run.
[00:39.60]The term law and order includes
[00:42.76]how police enforce laws
[00:45.28]and how the judicial system
[00:48.12]deals with criminals.
[00:50.76]Law and order also describes a situation
[00:54.40]where most people respect and obey laws.
[00:58.64]They want to feel safe
[01:01.00]and to have a sense of public order.
[01:05.68]Sometimes people use the term
[01:08.20]to describe a political candidate.
[01:11.76]For example:
[01:13.00]If a city has problems with crime,
[01:15.92]candidates for public office
[01:18.32]might run a law and order campaign.
[01:21.44]They promise to put policies in place
[01:25.36]that reduce crime.
[01:28.44]Now, when we talk about catching criminals,
[01:31.44]we can use another expression:
[01:34.08]the long arm of the law.
[01:37.28]This describes the ability of police to find
[01:41.56]and catch people who commit crimes.
[01:45.32]It further describes the power of law enforcement
[01:49.44]and the legal system to punish criminals
[01:53.12]and carry out justice.
[01:57.08]So, the long arm of the law
[01:59.52]is the far-reaching power of police
[02:02.36]and the legal system.
[02:04.96]For example:
[02:06.24]Criminals who are on the run
[02:08.68]are unlikely to escape
[02:10.80]the long arm of the law forever.
[02:13.64]If they make one mistake,
[02:16.00]they might get caught.
[02:18.96]Now, let's talk about non-criminals.
[02:21.96]Sometimes people might do things
[02:25.44]that they do not know are illegal.
[02:28.80]For example,
[02:30.04]A prank or practical joke
[02:32.84]played on a friend might seem harmless.
[02:36.28]But in the eyes of the law,
[02:39.32]it might actually be illegal.
[02:42.92]When we say in the eyes of the law,
[02:45.88]we mean what a law actually says
[02:49.36]and how people who enforce the law understand it.
[02:54.84]That leads us to another expression:
[02:57.72]ignorance of the law is no excuse.
[03:02.16]If we are ignorant of something,
[03:04.40]we don't know about it.
[03:06.20]However, simply not knowing
[03:09.20]if an action is illegal
[03:11.24]doesn't matter in the eyes of the law.
[03:14.08]The long arm of the law will still reach out
[03:17.92]and uphold the law.
[03:20.84]Then we might find ourselves
[03:22.64]on the wrong side of the law.
[03:25.08]And that's a bad place to be.
[03:28.48]Being on the wrong side of the law
[03:30.88]means we have broken a law,
[03:33.76]or worse, laws.
[03:37.44]So, if we want to be upstanding,
[03:40.48]law-abiding citizens
[03:42.64]and avoid the long arm of the law,
[03:46.00]we should stay on the right side of the law!
[03:50.64]And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories.
[03:53.68]Until next time,
[03:55.12]I'm Anna Matteo.
