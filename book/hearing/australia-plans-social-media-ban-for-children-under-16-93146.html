。
[00:00.04]The Australian government recently announced plans
[00:05.68]to ban the use of social media
[00:08.68]by children under the age of 16.
[00:13.24]Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said,
[00:16.60]"Social media is doing harm to our kids."
[00:20.72]He added that now is the time
[00:23.92]for the government to intervene.
[00:27.40]The country's Parliament will introduce a new bill
[00:31.68]during the final two weeks of its meeting
[00:35.24]starting on November 18.
[00:39.24]The bill will set an age limit of 16 for children
[00:44.28]to use social media and make the services
[00:48.60]responsible for enforcement.
[00:52.36]Albanese told reporters
[00:54.72]that the age limit would take effect
[00:58.08]12 months after the bill is passed.
[01:02.96]And social media services, including X,
[01:07.40]TikTok, Instagram and Facebook,
[01:11.08]would need to use the year to work out
[01:15.40]how to put age controls in place.
[01:20.08]"I've spoken to thousands of parents,
[01:23.64]grandparents, aunties and uncles.
[01:27.24]They, like me, are worried sick about
[01:31.36]the safety of our kids online," Albanese said.
[01:37.80]The proposal comes at a time
[01:40.56]when governments around the world
[01:43.32]are considering ways to control
[01:46.16]how young people use
[01:48.08]smartphones and social media.
[01:52.12]Under the Australian proposal,
[01:54.80]social media companies would face penalties
[01:58.48]for violating the age limit.
[02:02.08]However, under-age children
[02:05.08]and their parents would not face penalties.
[02:09.48]Antigone Davis is the head of safety at Meta,
[02:13.64]which owns Facebook and Instagram.
[02:17.44]Davis said the company would respect
[02:20.84]any age limits the government wants to put in place.
[02:26.20]She added that officials need to discuss the ways
[02:30.24]social media can make the age limit happen.
[02:34.04]She suggested that stronger tools in app stores
[02:39.28]and computer systems for parents
[02:42.04]could be a "simple and effective solution."
[02:47.40]X did not immediately answer a request
[02:51.16]from The Associated Press (AP) for comment.
[02:57.40]TikTok said it would not offer a comment to the AP.
[03:02.80]More than 140 experts in fields
[03:06.08]related to technology and children
[03:09.68]signed an open letter to Albanese last month
[03:13.40]opposing a social media age limit.

[03:50.48]Jackie Hallan is a director
