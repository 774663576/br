<p>Experts say pastoralism can teach those that keep animals in industrial numbers to change with the climate and reduce their effects on the environment. Pastoralists are not only trying to keep up with climate change; they are fighting it.</p>
<p><strong>Mongolian herders</strong></p>

<p>Agvaantogtokh and his family are <strong>herders. </strong>On horseback, he rides with nearly a thousand sheep and goats to help them find water. Sometimes, he and his wife, Nurmaa, stop to help struggling young ones, weak after a difficult winter.</p>

<p>Agvaantogtokh and his family sell animals for meat. They also sell <strong>dairy </strong>products such as yogurt and hard cheeses. While they consider the animals as their property, they also see them as living beings working alongside them.</p>
<p>Researchers say herders believe in "animal agency." Agvaantogtokh lets his animals choose the food they eat and where they find water. To him, restricting an animal's movement and asking it to eat the same thing each day is like putting a person in prison.</p>

[00:00.04]More than 50 million people in Asia, Africa,
[00:05.32]the Middle East and elsewhere
[00:07.72]follow pastoralism as a way of life.
[00:12.96]They keep animals and move with them
[00:16.28]to find lands from which their animals can eat.
[00:21.60]They often sell some of their animals as meat also.
[00:27.36]Pastoralism has supported these populations
[00:31.56]for much of history.
[00:34.40]But it faces pressure from worsening environments,
[00:38.64]reductions of pastoral lands,
[00:41.76]and new generations who seek a less difficult life.
[00:47.72]At the same time, pastoralism is modernizing,
[00:52.56]with groups using new technologies.
[00:56.96]The practice has survived for so long
[01:00.24]because it is designed to change with the environment.
[01:05.88]Pastoralists move with animals
[01:09.00]to find new lands and water,
[01:12.24]leaving behind eaten plants to regrow.
