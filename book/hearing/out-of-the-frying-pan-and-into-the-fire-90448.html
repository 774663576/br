。
[00:07.52]And now, Words and Their Stories, from VOA Learning English.
[00:18.36]On this program, we explore idioms, or expressions,
[00:22.32]in the English language.
[00:24.36]We give examples and notes on usage.
[00:28.16]And, sometimes we even use them in short stories.
[00:33.80]Today we talk about bad situations.
[00:38.16]Sometimes we think a situation is very bad.
[00:42.20]We cannot imagine that it can get any worse.
[00:46.32]But then it does.
[00:50.12]We have an expression for just that situation –
[00:53.68]out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[00:59.24]Imagine we are camping.
[01:01.40]The area is near a small river.
[01:04.72]So, for dinner, we decide to go fishing.
[01:09.00]Fish cooked over a campfire is a tasty meal indeed.
[01:14.56]We start the fire. We add butter and onions to the frying pan.
[01:20.80]When it heats up, we add the fish.
[01:23.96]In the frying pan, the fish is in a very bad situation.
[01:29.36]It flips violently back and forth.
[01:33.80]It tries to get out of the hot frying pan.
[01:37.44]Finally, the fish flips out of the frying pan but lands in the fire.
[01:45.60]The idiom out of the frying pan and into the fire
[01:49.64]means you leave a bad situation purposefully
[01:54.08]only to find yourself in a much worse situation.
[01:59.68]You thought you were improving it,
[02:02.16]but the opposite happened.
[02:05.56]Sometimes, this saying describes a choice
[02:09.24]between two equally difficult options.
[02:14.16]Here is another example.
[02:16.76]Let's say your friend complains about his job all the time.
[02:22.76]He says his commute to the office is too long and the pay is too low.
[02:29.48]You remind him that he gets great benefits,
[02:32.72]and he has the freedom to set his own hours.
[02:37.20]You tell him that no job is perfect.
[02:40.60]But he does not listen.
[02:44.24]He leaves his job and starts another one.
[02:48.24]When you talk to him a month later,
[02:51.48]this is how the conversation might go.
[02:55.40]A: Hey, how is the new job going?
[02:58.16]B: To be honest ... not so good.
[03:01.40]A: Oh no! What's wrong?
[03:04.24]B: Well, I used to set my own hours.
[03:07.24]My new job has a strict 9-to-5 policy.
[03:11.92]A: Being about to set your own hours is a big plus.
[03:16.28]B: And my take-home pay might be more.
[03:20.00]But I have to pay so much more for health insurance.
[03:24.00]And I have to pay for a parking space.
[03:27.72]A: Sounds like you've jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[03:32.44]B: Please don't remind me.
[03:36.04]And here is a final note on usage.
[03:39.64]If the friend in this conversation simply said,
[03:43.36]"Sounds like you just jumped out of the frying pan,"
[03:47.20]we would know they mean this expression.
[03:52.04]Some word experts say this phrase comes from very early Greek poetry.
[03:58.24]Those early poets used the expression to describe the process
[04:03.32]of trying to escape smoke
[04:06.04]and getting burned by the flames instead.
[04:11.04]And that's all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories.
[04:15.20]Do you have a question about an idiom or expression?
[04:19.16]Send us an email to voalearningenglish.com and let us know!
[04:25.76]Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.
