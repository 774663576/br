<textarea id="lrc_content" name="textfield" style="display:none;">[ti:One in Four Americans Make Money from the Online Economy]

。
[00:00.12]Nearly one in four Americans made money over the last 12 months
[00:05.84]by using their personal computers
[00:08.44]or other devices connected to the Internet.
[00:12.76]The Pew Research Center, an independent research group in Washington,
[00:18.24]found that people are using the Internet to find extra work.
[00:23.40]They go online to sell things such as used books and furniture
[00:29.92]or they offer to provide services
[00:32.60]such as babysitting, house cleaning or computer repairs.
[00:37.40]The Pew Center asked people if they make money from the Internet
[00:42.68]or computing devices, and, if so, what they do to earn their pay.
[00:49.44]The answers provided the findings of Pew's new report
[00:54.16]on what has been called the "Gig Economy."
[00:58.08]Pew found that income earned on the Internet can come in many forms.
[01:05.04]Many Americans said they used their computers to do extra work.
[01:11.24]About five percent of Americans said they did online computer work over the last year.
[01:18.48]Some of these people said they had jobs that paid a few pennies each to take surveys.
[01:25.84]In these surveys, people are asked for their opinions of
[01:30.96]different products or well-known people.
[01:34.68]Others typed reports or other information on their home computers.
[01:41.00]Using digital devices to offer a service online was another way to earn income.
[01:49.84]About two percent of Americans earned money from ride-sharing companies
[01:55.24]such as Uber and Lyft.
[01:57.88]When drivers are ready to pick up passengers,
[02:01.72]they use their ride-share company's app.
[02:05.68]The computer program lets them know
[02:08.20]when passengers are ready to be picked up and how to reach them.
[02:13.84]Some people make their homes, apartments, or rooms inside their homes,
[02:19.92]available for money to people visiting their cities.
[02:24.24]A popular website people use to makes rooms available is www.airbnb.com.
[02:33.56]Other people use apps on their computer devices
[02:38.28]that permit people to hire them to babysit,
[02:41.64]walk dogs or do repair or clean-up work.
[02:46.24]Apps operated from phones or tablets
[02:49.68]connect them to people looking for such services.
[02:53.80]About 60 percent of people involved in the gig economy
[02:58.64]say the income they earn is important to them.
[03:02.92]But just one in five people who sell things online
[03:06.80]say the income is enough to be important to their lives.
[03:12.80]Only 16 percent believe doing online work will lead to a meaningful career.
[03:20.96]But 37 percent say the extra income earned from online jobs
[03:26.84]helps them make up for shortages in money.
[03:31.36]The number one reason people gave for taking online jobs
[03:35.72]was that the work gave them something to do and was fun.
[03:40.04]Pew said that reason was listed by 42 percent of people it questioned.
[03:46.80]But, opinions about the online economy are mixed.
[03:51.36]Sixty-eight percent say the gig economy is good for people
[03:56.64]who want flexibility when they work.
[04:00.12]Flexibility means they do not have to work when they are at their regular jobs
[04:05.16]or have family or school events or other things they want or need to do.
[04:12.00]But, 23 percent say online work lets companies take advantage of employees
[04:18.44]and only 16 percent believe they can build careers with gig work.
[04:24.68]By taking advantage, some people mean they do not get paid enough
[04:29.64]for work done through online companies.
[04:33.68]About one in five say they take online jobs to gain work experience,
[04:40.00]while 17 percent say it is because they cannot find other jobs.
[04:46.44]What kind of people work online or use online devices to find work?
[04:53.92]The answer appears to be: mostly people who already have jobs.
[04:59.52]According to Pew, 68 percent say they are already employed full time or part time.
[05:07.76]Twenty-three percent say they are students.
[05:12.36]Thirty-two percent say they have no other jobs.
[05:16.72]I'm Jonathan Evans.
