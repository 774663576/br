<p>"Look what you...made me do," entertainer Taylor Swift wrote on social media as she <strong>premiered</strong> <em>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</em> movie Wednesday night in Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>The film of Swift's live performances was first planned to open on Friday. It is expected to launch with $100 million in <strong>ticket</strong> sales for the opening weekend. But early ticket sales worldwide have already been estimated to reach $140 million.</p>

<p>Unlike many Hollywood productions, <em>The Eras Tour</em> movie does not need any outside advertising. Swift produced the film herself and informed her 274 million followers on Instagram.</p>
<p>The film will play in movie theaters for at least 13 weeks. Adult tickets are being sold for $19.89. That is higher than the average movie ticket price but several thousand less than some tickets to see Swift live.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, Swift arrived at an AMC Theatre in Los Angeles. She took pictures with fans at the premiere.</p>
<p>Inside the theater, Swift thanked fans for supporting the Eras Tour, which organizers say sold all available tickets for large <strong>stadium</strong> performances around the world. "I've never had this much fun in my life as I had at the Eras Tour," she said.</p>
<p>Swift is returning to the ongoing Eras Tour next month with live performances planned in Argentina and Brazil. After that, the tour will head to Japan, Australia, Singapore and several countries in Europe.</p>
